# Code Review

<!-- mustflow-section: purpose -->
## Purpose

Verify that a change aligns with the request and ensure that no behavioral risks or verification gaps persist.

<!-- mustflow-section: use-when -->
## Use When

- Code changes, diffs, pull requests, or potential regression risks require review.
- The primary objective is risk assessment rather than implementing new behavior.

<!-- mustflow-section: do-not-use-when -->
## Do Not Use When

- The task involves only wording, translation, or formatting changes.
- No changed files or diffs are available for review.

<!-- mustflow-section: required-inputs -->
## Required Inputs

- Modified files or diffs
- User-specified review criteria
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.mustflow/docs/agent-workflow.md`
- `.mustflow/config/commands.toml`

<!-- mustflow-section: preconditions -->
## Preconditions

- The task matches the Use When conditions and does not match the Do Not Use When exclusions.
- Required inputs are available, or missing inputs can be reported without guessing.
- Higher-priority instructions and `.mustflow/config/commands.toml` have been checked for the current scope.

<!-- mustflow-section: allowed-edits -->
## Allowed Edits

- Keep edits within the scope described by this skill, the user request, and the matching route in `.mustflow/skills/INDEX.md`.
- Do not broaden command permission, invent project facts, or change unrelated workflow files.

<!-- mustflow-section: procedure -->
## Procedure

1. Review the list of modified files.
2. Identify any unrelated or extraneous edits.
3. Assess the impact on behavior, configuration, commands, and documentation.
4. Check evidence quality before writing findings:
   - every finding must cite current file, line or symbol evidence, and the observed behavior or
     data flow that makes it a bug
   - a failed read, directory listing, stale generated map, external AI claim, or duplicate tool
     result is not enough to say a file is empty, missing, unused, unsafe, or buggy
   - if the same read, list, search, or path inspection repeats without new evidence, switch to
     `evidence-stall-breaker` before continuing the review
5. Check maintainability risks that should be caught before PR readiness:
   - long `if`/`else if` dispatch over one reason, status, or type code where a `switch`, lookup table, or policy helper would clarify intent
   - user-visible strings embedded in control flow instead of the existing localization or message-catalog surface
   - repeated metadata reads or object assembly across success, failure, preview, and reporting paths
   - external bot or AI review comments treated as authority instead of triage evidence
6. Review test relevance:
   - missing tests for new functionality
   - obsolete tests for removed functionality
   - redundant tests that fail to address new risks
   - weakened or insufficient assertions
   - snapshot updates lacking a clear rationale
   - tests that inadvertently reintroduce removed behavior
7. Verify the existence of relevant command intents.
8. Document findings categorized by severity.

<!-- mustflow-section: postconditions -->
## Postconditions

- The expected output can be produced with clear evidence, executed command intents, skipped checks, and remaining risks.
- Any missing command intent, unknown input, or authority conflict is reported instead of hidden.

<!-- mustflow-section: verification -->
## Verification

Follow `.mustflow/docs/agent-workflow.md#command-execution-policy`.

Related command intents:

- `test`
- `test_related`
- `test_audit`
- `lint`

Avoid introducing raw shell commands; reference the command intent names defined in `.mustflow/config/commands.toml`.

<!-- mustflow-section: failure-handling -->
## Failure Handling

- If a command intent is missing, restricted to manual execution, disabled, or unknown, report the status rather than guessing.
- Document any skipped verifications and the associated remaining risks.
- If evidence stalls or repeated observations appear, use `evidence-stall-breaker` and downgrade
  unsupported findings to unconfirmed hypotheses.
- Immediately halt and report if sensitive data or destructive command risks are identified.

<!-- mustflow-section: output-format -->
## Output Format

- Summary
- Findings categorized by severity
- List of reviewed files
- Evidence basis for each finding or downgraded hypothesis
- Command intents executed
- Skipped command intents and justifications
- Notes on test relevance
- Identified remaining risks
