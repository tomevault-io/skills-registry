# GitHub Repository Setup

Prepare GitHub repositories for publication with proper configuration including privacy settings, metadata, and feature management using GitHub CLI.

⚠️ **Note**: This skill keeps repositories simple and minimal. It does NOT add LICENSE files, CODEOWNERS, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, or issue templates. It focuses only on core GitHub repository configuration.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Repository name defined
- (Optional) Repository description for the about section

## Checking GitHub CLI

Before using this skill, verify that GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated:

```bash
# Check if gh is installed
which gh

# If not installed, install it (macOS):
brew install gh

# For other systems:
# Windows: choco install gh
# Linux: Follow https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md

# Authenticate with GitHub (if not already authenticated)
gh auth login
```

If `gh` is not installed, you'll see an error. Use the installation command for your operating system above.

## Basic setup

Create and configure a new private GitHub repository (always private):

```bash
# Create a private repository
gh repo create <repo-name> --private --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Configure repository settings (add description)
gh repo edit <owner>/<repo-name> --description="Your repository description"
```

## Complete setup workflow

Use this comprehensive workflow to set up a private repository with all recommended settings:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
REPO_NAME="my-repository"
REPO_DESCRIPTION="Brief description of the repository"
OWNER="your-github-username"  # or your organization

# Step 0: Check if gh CLI is installed
if ! command -v gh &> /dev/null; then
    echo "GitHub CLI is not installed. Install it with:"
    echo "  macOS: brew install gh"
    echo "  Other systems: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation"
    exit 1
fi

# Step 1: Create private repository (always private)
gh repo create "${REPO_NAME}" \
  --private \
  --source=. \
  --remote=origin \
  --push \
  --description="${REPO_DESCRIPTION}"

# Step 2: Add description to about section (if needed)
gh repo edit "${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}" --description="${REPO_DESCRIPTION}"

# Step 3: Disable wikis and discussions
gh repo edit "${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}" --enable-wiki=false --enable-discussions=false

# Step 4: Open repository in browser
gh repo view "${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}" --web
```

## Configuration options

### Repository type

**Always private** (default for this skill):
All repositories created with this skill are automatically set to private for security and control.

If you need to change visibility later:
```bash
gh repo edit <owner>/<repo-name> --visibility private
```

### Repository description

Set the description that appears in the repository's about section:

```bash
gh repo edit <owner>/<repo-name> --description "Your repository description"
```

The description should be concise and clearly communicate the repository's purpose.

### Disable features

**Disable releases**:
Releases are managed via branch protection rules and GitHub Actions workflows. To prevent accidental releases:
- Use branch protection on main/master
- Limit who can create releases via repository permissions

**Disable environments**:
```bash
# Environments are disabled by default for private repositories
# For public repositories, restrict environment access:
gh repo edit <owner>/<repo-name> --enable-discussions=false
```

### Additional settings

**Branch protection** (protect main branch):
```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo-name>/branches/main/protection \
  -X PUT \
  -F enforce_admins=true \
  -F require_code_review_count=1 \
  -F dismiss_stale_reviews=true
```

**Disable wikis and discussions**:
```bash
gh repo edit <owner>/<repo-name> --enable-wiki=false --enable-discussions=false
```

**Add topics** (optional):
```bash
gh repo edit <owner>/<repo-name> --add-topic python --add-topic github
```

## Verifying configuration

Once setup is complete, your repository will open in the browser via `gh repo view --web`. You can also manually verify settings:

```bash
# View repository details
gh repo view <owner>/<repo-name>

# Check specific settings
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo-name> --jq '.{name, private, description, has_releases, has_environments}'
```

## Tips

- Test setup commands on a test repository first
- Use environment variables for repetitive parameters
- Automate setup with the provided script for consistency
- Always verify settings after configuration
- Use `gh repo edit --help` to see all available options
