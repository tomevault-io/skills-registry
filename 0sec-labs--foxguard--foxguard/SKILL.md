description: Apply foxguard's secure-coding patterns when writing or fixing security-sensitive code. Use proactively when handling user input, shelling out, building SQL, doing file I/O, fetching URLs, generating randomness, or touching crypto. Use when this capability is needed.

Use this guidance when writing or fixing code that touches any of these surfaces. Match the language patterns to what foxguard's rules look for so the auto-scan stays clean.

## Command execution

- Never pass concatenated strings to a shell. Use argument lists.
  - Python: `subprocess.run(["git", "log", branch], check=True)` — never `subprocess.run(f"git log {branch}", shell=True)`.
  - Node: `execFile("git", ["log", branch])` — never `exec(`git log ${branch}`)`.
  - Go: `exec.Command("git", "log", branch)` — never `exec.Command("sh", "-c", "git log "+branch)`.
- If a shell is genuinely required, validate the input against a strict allowlist regex first.

## SQL

- Use parameterized queries everywhere. `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM u WHERE id = ?", (uid,))` — not f-strings or `%`.
- ORMs are fine; raw `query.format(...)` / `+` concat is not.

## Path traversal

- Resolve and bound paths: `Path(root).resolve() / Path(name).name` — strip directory components from untrusted names.
- Reject inputs that contain `..`, absolute paths, or null bytes before joining.

## SSRF

- For outbound HTTP from user-supplied URLs: parse the URL, resolve the host, and reject private/loopback/link-local ranges (`10.0.0.0/8`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `169.254.0.0/16`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `::1`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`) and metadata endpoints (`169.254.169.254`).
- Prefer an allowlist over a denylist when the destinations are known.

## Secrets

- Read from env / secrets manager, never from string literals. `os.getenv("API_TOKEN")` — not `API_TOKEN = "sk-..."`.
- Even in tests, prefer fixtures from env or a vault. High-entropy strings in code will be flagged.
- Never log secrets. Redact before logging.

## Randomness

- Security-sensitive: `secrets.token_urlsafe`, `crypto.randomBytes`, `OsRng`, `crypto/rand`. Never `random.random()`, `Math.random()`, `rand()`, `math/rand`.
- Non-security (jitter, sampling): the fast PRNGs are fine.

## Crypto

- New code: AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 for symmetric; Ed25519 for signatures; X25519 for key agreement (until PQ rollout). Never DES, 3DES, RC4, MD5, SHA-1.
- Asymmetric crypto in long-lived security paths: prefer hybrid suites (X25519+ML-KEM) where the toolchain supports it. Use `/foxguard:pq-audit` to find legacy usage.
- Password hashing: argon2id or bcrypt. Never plain SHA-2 or unsalted hashes.

## Deserialization

- Never `pickle.load`, `yaml.load` (use `safe_load`), `Marshal.load`, or `unserialize` on untrusted input.
- For JSON, deserialize into a typed schema (pydantic, zod, serde) — don't trust the shape.

When you finish a fix, the PostToolUse hook will re-scan the file and confirm it's clean. If a finding persists, read the rule's description carefully — the remediation is usually one of the patterns above.
