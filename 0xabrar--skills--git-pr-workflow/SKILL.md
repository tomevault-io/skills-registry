# Git PR Workflow

## Overview

Standardize branch management and PR creation with GitHub CLI. Favor clear, minimal steps and ask for missing details (base branch, target repo, reviewers, labels) only when needed.

## Branch workflow

1) Sync main (or chosen base):
```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

2) Create feature branch:
```
git checkout -b feat/short-description
```

3) Push with tracking on first push:
```
git push -u origin feat/short-description
```

4) Subsequent pushes:
```
git push
```

## Syncing with base

Rebase on the latest base branch to avoid conflicts:
```
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

If rebase is not desired, merge instead:
```
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

## PR preparation

1) Ensure branch is pushed:
```
git push -u origin feat/short-description
```

2) Confirm gh is authenticated:
```
gh auth status
```

## PR creation (GitHub CLI)

Basic PR:
```
gh pr create --title "type(scope): short description" --body "Detailed description"
```

Draft PR:
```
gh pr create --draft --title "wip: short description" --body "Work in progress"
```

With reviewers/labels/base:
```
gh pr create --base develop --title "fix(scope): short description" --body "Details" --reviewer @username --label bug,urgent
```

## PR description template (raw markdown)

When asked to generate PR content, output raw markdown exactly using this template:
```
## Summary
[1-2 sentences: what changed and why]

## High-Level Changes
- [Change 1]: [user-facing or architectural impact]
- [Change 2]: [impact]

## Detailed Implementation
- [Component Architecture]: [new/changed components]
- [State Management & Logic]: [state/data/validation changes]
- [Dependencies]: [new/updated packages]

## Test Plan
- [ ] Manual test step 1
- [ ] Manual test step 2
- [ ] Automated tests pass
```

## Multi-worktree notes

If working across multiple worktrees (e.g. `ansel-agent-a`, `ansel-agent-b`):
- Confirm the active worktree before running commands:
  - `pwd`
  - `git status -sb`
  - `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
- List worktrees when unsure:
  - `git worktree list`
- Use `git -C /path/to/worktree ...` if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- Branch not on remote:
  - `git push -u origin <branch>`
- No commits to PR:
  - `git log main..HEAD`
  - `git status -sb`
 - GH auth issues:
   - `gh auth status`
   - `gh auth login`
