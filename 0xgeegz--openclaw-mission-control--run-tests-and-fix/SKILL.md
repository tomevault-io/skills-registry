# Run Tests and Fix Failures

## Overview

Execute the full test suite and systematically fix any failures, ensuring code quality and functionality.

## Steps

1. **Run test suite**
   - Execute all tests in the project
   - Capture output and identify failures
   - Check both unit and integration tests

2. **Analyze failures**
   - Categorize by type: flaky, broken, new failures
   - Prioritize fixes based on impact
   - Check if failures are related to recent changes

3. **Fix issues systematically**
   - Start with the most critical failures
   - Fix one issue at a time
   - Re-run tests after each fix

## Test recovery checklist

- [ ] Full test suite executed
- [ ] Failures categorized and tracked
- [ ] Root causes resolved
- [ ] Tests re-run with passing results
- [ ] Follow-up improvements noted
