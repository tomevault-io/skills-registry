# Analyzing Gaps

Compare user expectations captured in UTCs and journeys with actual code behavior documented in reality files. Generate structured gap reports with severity classification, JTBD impact mapping, and resolution recommendations.

---

## Trigger

```
/analyze-gap {journey-id}
/analyze-gap {journey-id} --reality {component}
/analyze-gap {journey-id} --severity-threshold {level}
```

**Examples:**
```bash
/analyze-gap reward-understanding
/analyze-gap reward-understanding --reality use-recipe-deposit-flow
/analyze-gap informed-decision --severity-threshold high
```

---

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `journey-id` | Yes | Journey identifier to analyze |
| `--reality {component}` | No | Specific reality file to compare (otherwise uses journey's linked reality) |
| `--severity-threshold {level}` | No | Filter output to show only gaps at or above this severity |
| `--update-canvases` | No | Automatically update source canvas expectation gap tables |

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Load Journey Context

1. Read journey file from `grimoires/observer/journeys/{journey-id}.md`
2. Extract:
   - Journey steps (trigger, action, expected, potential errors)
   - Source canvases list
   - Success condition
   - Known gaps table

### Phase 2: Load User Truth (UTCs)

For each canvas in `source_canvases`:

1. Read canvas from `grimoires/observer/canvas/{username}.md`
2. Extract:
   - Qualitative evidence (quotes)
   - JTBD (primary and secondary)
   - Expectation gap table
   - Learning status

Aggregate user expectations:
- Compile all quotes related to journey
- Map quotes to journey steps
- Identify JTBD patterns across users

### Phase 3: Load Code Reality

1. Find reality file:
   - Use `--reality {component}` if provided
   - Otherwise check journey's `reality_file` metadata
   - Otherwise search `grimoires/observer/reality/` for matches

2. Read reality file and extract:
   - States and their triggers
   - UI feedback messages
   - Error handling patterns
   - File:line evidence

### Phase 4: Step-by-Step Comparison

For each journey step:

**User Expects** (from journey + canvases):
- Expected behavior from journey step
- Related quotes from UTCs
- Implicit expectations from JTBD

**Code Does** (from reality file):
- Actual state/behavior at this step
- UI feedback provided
- Error handling in place

**Identify Gap**:
- Expectation vs implementation mismatch
- Missing functionality
- Confusing or insufficient feedback
- Error cases not handled

### Phase 5: Classify Gaps

For each identified gap, determine:

**Gap Type**:
| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Bug | Code doesn't work as designed | Transaction fails silently |
| Feature | Functionality doesn't exist | No activity log for rebates |
| Flow | Steps are confusing or wrong order | Can't find migration button |
| Communication | Information not conveyed clearly | No explanation of what "approve" does |
| Strategy | Design decision creates friction | Too many transaction steps |

**Severity**:
| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Critical | Blocks core functionality, data loss risk |
| High | Major friction, workaround difficult |
| Medium | Noticeable friction, workaround exists |
| Low | Minor annoyance, improvement opportunity |

**JTBD Impact**:
- Which job does this gap block or impair?
- How many users affected (from canvas learning_status)?

### Phase 6: Generate Gap Report

Create report at `grimoires/crucible/gaps/{journey-id}-gaps.md`:

```yaml
---
type: gap-report
journey: "{journey-id}"
created: "{ISO-8601}"
updated: "{ISO-8601}"
total_gaps: {N}
by_severity:
  critical: {N}
  high: {N}
  medium: {N}
  low: {N}
by_type:
  bug: {N}
  feature: {N}
  flow: {N}
  communication: {N}
  strategy: {N}
linked_reality_files:
  - {reality-file}
---
```

Include sections:
1. **Summary** - Journey metadata, analysis date
2. **Gap Registry** - Individual gap entries with full details
3. **Resolution Summary** - Table of all gaps with status
4. **Recommended Actions** - Prioritized by severity

### Phase 7: Update Linked Artifacts

1. **Update Journey** - Add `gap_report` field to frontmatter
2. **Update Source Canvases** (if `--update-canvases`):
   - Add/update entries in Expectation Gap table
   - Include file:line from reality
3. **Update state.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   gaps:
     directory: grimoires/crucible/gaps/
     count: {n+1}
     last_analysis: "{timestamp}"

   journeys:
     {journey-id}:
       gap_report: grimoires/crucible/gaps/{journey-id}-gaps.md
       gap_count: {N}
   ```

## Counterfactuals — False Gaps & Stale Reality

Gap analysis compares user expectations (from canvases) with code behavior (from reality files). The failure modes arise when either input is wrong — producing phantom gaps that don't exist, or missing real gaps because the comparison baseline is outdated.

### Target (Correct Behavior)

The skill loads a journey definition, reads the linked canvases to extract user expectations (Level 3 hypotheses, expectation gaps, journey fragments), then loads the corresponding reality file from `/ground` to get actual code behavior. For each expectation, it checks whether the code supports, partially supports, or does not support the expected behavior. Gaps are classified by type (Bug, Feature, Discoverability) and severity.

A gap exists only when there is a verifiable mismatch between what the user expects (grounded in their quotes and behavior) and what the code actually does (grounded in the reality file). Both sides must be grounded — hypothesis vs. hypothesis is not a gap, it's speculation.

### Near Miss — Concept Impermanence

The seductively wrong behavior: using a stale reality file as the code-side ground truth.

Reality files are point-in-time snapshots generated by `/ground` or `/ride`. Code changes continuously — a bug fix merged yesterday may have closed a gap that the reality file still shows as open. Running gap analysis against a week-old reality file produces false positives: gaps that were real when the reality was captured but no longer exist.

The staleness risk compounds with canvas data:
- Canvas says user expected X (captured 3 weeks ago)
- Reality file says code does Y (captured 2 weeks ago)
- Code was updated to do X (merged 1 week ago)
- Gap analysis reports X ≠ Y → false gap

The correct behavior: check reality file freshness before analysis. If the reality file is older than the most recent commit touching the relevant code paths, warn the operator and suggest re-running `/ground`. Never report a gap with HIGH confidence from stale inputs — downgrade to MEDIUM with a staleness note.

The `/drift` skill exists precisely for this purpose — it computes confidence decay on artifacts. Gap analysis should consume drift scores, not ignore them.

### Category Error — Coupling Inversion

The fundamentally wrong behavior: treating every code change in a relevant file as evidence of a gap.

A code change is not a gap. A gap is a mismatch between user expectation and code behavior. When `/ground` generates a new reality file showing a function was refactored, that refactoring is only a gap if it changed behavior that users depend on. Internal refactoring (same behavior, different implementation) produces a diff in the reality file but zero user-facing impact.

The inversion: the skill should flow from user expectations → code behavior check. Not from code changes → user impact speculation. Starting from code changes and guessing which users might be affected reverses the Observer's research direction — it turns hypothesis-first research into code-first speculation.

Examples of this inversion:
- "Score calculation function was refactored" → not a gap unless scores actually changed
- "New API endpoint added" → not a gap, it's a feature (users can't expect what didn't exist)
- "CSS class renamed" → not a gap unless visual output changed

The skill should only report gaps where a specific user expectation (quoted, attributed, from a canvas) does not match a specific code behavior (verified, from a fresh reality file). Everything else is noise.

A concrete scenario: the score-api team refactors the `calculateOGScore()` function — extracting helper methods, renaming internal variables, improving test coverage. The reality file diff shows 200 lines changed. But the function's inputs and outputs are identical. Gap analysis that starts from "200 lines changed in scoring" and speculates about user impact will generate false gaps for every canvas that mentions OG scores.

The correct sequence:
1. Load canvas expectation: "User expected OG score to reflect recent mints"
2. Check reality file: Does `calculateOGScore()` include recent mints? → Yes (unchanged behavior)
3. Result: No gap. The refactoring is invisible to the user.

Starting from the code diff inverts this: "200 lines changed → which users might be affected? → anyone who mentioned OG scores." This produces a gap report full of false positives that wastes the operator's time triaging non-issues.

The `/drift` skill provides the necessary freshness signal. If the reality file's confidence has decayed below the threshold, gap analysis should either refuse to run (with a suggestion to re-ground) or downgrade all reported gaps to LOW confidence with a staleness warning. High-confidence gaps from stale inputs are worse than no gaps at all — they create false certainty.

## Error Handling

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Journey not found | List available journeys, suggest creation |
| No source canvases | Prompt to add canvases to journey |
| Reality file not found | Suggest running `/ground` first |
| No gaps found | Report success, mark journey as aligned |
| Canvas parse error | Log error, continue with available canvases |
