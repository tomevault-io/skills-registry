# API Versioning and Compatibility

Strategies for versioning APIs, managing backward compatibility, handling deprecation, and coordinating version lifecycles across consumers.

## 1. Versioning Approaches

### 1.1 URL Path Versioning

The version identifier is embedded directly in the URL path.

```
GET /api/v1/users
GET /api/v2/users
GET /api/v1/users/42/orders
```

**Pros:**
- Visible in URLs, logs, and documentation at a glance
- Simple to route at the load balancer or gateway level
- Cache-friendly since each version has a distinct URL

**Cons:**
- Duplicates routes per version; every resource must be replicated
- Encourages large, sweeping version bumps rather than incremental changes
- Clients must update hardcoded URLs when migrating
- Violates the REST principle that a URI should identify a resource, not a representation version

**When to use:** Public APIs with external consumers. Stripe uses `/v1/`, Google Cloud uses `/v1/` and `/v2/`.

### 1.2 Header Versioning

```
Accept: application/vnd.mycompany.users.v2+json    # content negotiation
X-API-Version: 2                                     # custom header
```

**Pros:**
- URLs remain stable and resource-oriented
- Supports fine-grained versioning per resource or operation

**Cons:**
- Less discoverable; version is not visible in the URL
- Harder to test in a browser or with simple curl commands
- Caching proxies may not vary on custom headers by default

**When to use:** Internal APIs or where URL stability matters. GitHub uses `Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json`.

### 1.3 Query Parameter Versioning

```
GET /api/users?version=2
```

**Pros:**
- Easy to add to existing APIs without restructuring routes
- Simple to override during testing or debugging

**Cons:**
- Pollutes the query string with infrastructure concerns
- Complicates caching because query strings affect cache keys unpredictably
- Harder to enforce at the routing layer

**When to use:** Internal tooling or debugging fallback. Rarely the best choice for production APIs.

## 2. Semantic Versioning for APIs

Semver uses `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:
- **MAJOR** (v1 to v2): Breaking changes requiring consumer updates
- **MINOR** (v1.1 to v1.2): Backward-compatible new features
- **PATCH** (v1.1.0 to v1.1.1): Backward-compatible bug fixes

For URL versioning, only MAJOR appears in the path (`/v1/`). Communicate MINOR/PATCH through changelogs or response headers (`X-API-Version: 2.3.1`).

## 3. Breaking vs Non-Breaking Changes

**Breaking changes** (require new major version):
- Removing or renaming a field in request or response
- Changing a field's type (string to integer)
- Removing an endpoint or changing its HTTP method
- Making a previously optional field required
- Changing authentication requirements, error formats, or pagination structure
- Removing an enum value consumers depend on

**Non-breaking changes** (safe within current version):
- Adding new optional request fields, response fields, endpoints, or query parameters
- Adding new enum values (if consumers handle unknowns gracefully)
- Relaxing validation constraints; adding response headers

**Gray area:** Changing default values, adding required fields with defaults, changing rate limits, modifying field order in JSON.

## 4. Deprecation Strategies

### Sunset and Deprecation Headers

Use the `Sunset` header (RFC 8594) with a `Deprecation` header and migration link:

```
Deprecation: true
Sunset: Sat, 01 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT
Link: <https://api.example.com/docs/migration-v3>; rel="successor-version"
```

### Deprecation Practices

- Mark deprecated fields/endpoints in OpenAPI specs with `deprecated: true`
- Log usage of deprecated endpoints to track remaining consumers
- Ship migration guides with every major bump: breaking changes list, before/after examples, timeline, support contacts

### Typical Timeline

```
Month 0:  Announce deprecation. New version available.
Month 3:  Notify all known consumers with migration guide.
Month 6:  Warning headers on every old-version request.
Month 9:  Reduce SLA to best-effort for deprecated version.
Month 12: Remove deprecated version. Return 410 Gone.
```

Public APIs with many external consumers may need 18-24 months.

## 5. Version Lifecycle Management

Maintain at most two to three active major versions. Define clear states:

| State      | Description                                                          |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Preview    | Available for testing, may change without notice                     |
| Active     | Fully supported, recommended for new integrations                    |
| Deprecated | Functional but scheduled for removal, no new features                |
| Retired    | Returns 410 Gone with pointer to successor                          |

**Default version behavior** when consumer omits version: fixed default (predictable but can strand users), latest stable (risky for unexpected breaks), or require explicit version (safest but adds friction).

## 6. API Changelog Patterns

Maintain structured, machine-readable changelogs:

```json
{
  "version": "2.3.0",
  "date": "2025-01-15",
  "changes": [
    { "type": "added", "endpoint": "GET /v2/users/{id}/preferences", "description": "Retrieve user preferences" },
    { "type": "deprecated", "endpoint": "GET /v2/users/{id}/settings", "description": "Use /preferences. Sunset: 2025-07-15" }
  ]
}
```

Categorize entries as: added, changed, deprecated, removed, fixed, security. Link to migration docs for breaking changes. Publish changelogs in documentation and as an API endpoint.

## 7. Backward Compatibility Patterns

**Additive changes only:** The safest evolution strategy is to only add, never remove or rename:

```json
// v1 response (original)
{ "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }

// v1 response after additive change (still v1, non-breaking)
{ "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "phone": "+1-555-0100" }
```

**Optional fields with defaults:** New request fields must be optional with sensible defaults so existing clients are unaffected. For example, a new `role` field defaults to `"member"` when omitted.

**Response envelope stability:** Keep the top-level response structure (`data`, `meta`, `errors`) consistent across all changes within a version. Consumers build deserialization logic around this structure.

**Tolerant reader pattern:** Encourage consumers to ignore unknown fields, avoid depending on field ordering, and handle missing optional fields gracefully. Document this expectation in your API guidelines.

## 8. Database Schema Versioning

API version changes often require schema changes. Strategies for coexisting versions:

- **Expand-and-contract:** Add new columns first, migrate data, update the API, then remove old columns.
- **Database views:** Versioned views present data in the shape each API version expects while underlying tables evolve.
- **Migration sequencing:** Apply migrations in order that supports both old and new API simultaneously.

**Key rules:**
- Never drop a column while any active API version still reads from it
- Use feature flags to control which API version writes to new columns
- Test rollback scenarios: can you revert the API version without a database rollback?
- Coordinate migration timing with deployment: schema changes must be deployed before the API code that depends on them

## 9. OpenAPI/Swagger Versioning

Maintain separate spec files per major version (`openapi-v1.yaml`, `openapi-v2.yaml`). Mark deprecated operations:

```yaml
paths:
  /v1/users/{id}/settings:
    get:
      deprecated: true
      summary: Get user settings (use /preferences instead)
      x-sunset: "2025-07-15"
```

Use tools like `oasdiff` or `openapi-diff` in CI to detect breaking changes between spec versions automatically.

## 10. Real-World Examples

### REST Endpoint Evolution

```
# v1 original
GET /api/v1/users/42 -> { "id": 42, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }

# v1 additive (non-breaking)
GET /api/v1/users/42 -> { "id": 42, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z" }

# v2 restructured (breaking: name split)
GET /api/v2/users/42 -> { "id": 42, "first_name": "Alice", "last_name": "Smith", "email": "alice@example.com" }
```

### GraphQL Schema Evolution

GraphQL avoids URL versioning. Evolve additively with built-in deprecation:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @deprecated(reason: "Use firstName and lastName")
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: String!
}
```

Monitor field usage analytics to determine when deprecated fields can be removed safely.

## 11. Common Mistakes

- **Versioning too early:** Do not create v2 until you have an actual breaking change. Use additive changes within v1 as long as possible.
- **Too many active versions:** Four or more active major versions signals deprecation is too slow or breaking changes are too frequent.
- **Inconsistent versioning:** Mixing URL versioning for some endpoints and header versioning for others confuses consumers.
- **Treating minor changes as major:** Adding fields or endpoints does not need a major bump. Over-incrementing dilutes version meaning.
- **No version discovery:** Provide a discovery endpoint or include version info in response headers.

## 12. Migration Tooling and Consumer Communication

**Tooling:**
- Codemods/scripts to rewrite consumer code automatically (Stripe and Facebook invest heavily here)
- Adapter layers that translate v1 requests to v2 format internally
- Versioned client SDKs with clear upgrade instructions
- Sandbox environments for pre-migration testing

**Communication:**
- Changelog emails or webhooks to registered consumers
- Developer portal announcements
- API usage dashboards showing which deprecated endpoints a consumer still calls
- Direct outreach for high-traffic consumers

**Tracking migration progress:**

Monitor the percentage of traffic still hitting deprecated versions. Use this data to:

- Identify consumers who need targeted outreach
- Decide whether to extend or enforce sunset deadlines
- Justify the cost of maintaining old versions to stakeholders
- Set data-driven go/no-go decisions for version retirement
