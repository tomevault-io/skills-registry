# Monitoring and Observability

Concepts, tooling, and operational practices for monitoring production systems
and responding to incidents effectively.

---

## 1. The Three Pillars of Observability

### Logs
- Discrete events emitted by applications (errors, state changes, audit trails).
- High cardinality: every event can carry unique context.
- Best for debugging specific incidents after the fact.

### Metrics
- Numeric measurements aggregated over time (counters, gauges, histograms).
- Low cardinality by design: labels should have bounded value sets.
- Best for detecting trends, setting thresholds, and alerting.

### Traces
- Records of a single request as it traverses multiple services.
- Each trace contains spans representing individual operations.
- Best for identifying latency bottlenecks and dependency failures.

### How They Connect
A metric alert fires (error rate spike). You query logs filtered by service and
time window. You pull a trace ID from the logs to see the full request path.
Together they move you from "something is wrong" to "here is why."

---

## 2. Structured Logging

Unstructured text logs are difficult to search and aggregate. Structured logs
(typically JSON) make every field machine-parseable.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-14T08:22:11.403Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "service": "payment-service",
  "trace_id": "abc123def456",
  "correlation_id": "order-98765",
  "message": "Charge failed: card declined",
  "duration_ms": 342
}
```

**Log levels**: DEBUG (dev only), INFO (normal operations), WARN (recoverable
issues), ERROR (request-level failures), FATAL (process must exit).

**Correlation IDs**: Generate a unique ID at the edge (API gateway). Propagate
it via `X-Request-ID` header to every downstream call. Include it in every log
line to reconstruct the full request path.

---

## 3. Metrics Types

- **Counter**: Monotonically increasing. Use `rate()` to query. Examples: total
  requests, total errors.
- **Gauge**: Goes up and down. Examples: memory usage, active connections, queue
  depth.
- **Histogram**: Counts observations in configurable buckets. Produces `_bucket`,
  `_sum`, `_count` series. Use for latency distributions via
  `histogram_quantile()`.
- **Summary**: Calculates quantiles client-side. Not aggregatable across
  instances. Prefer histograms in most cases.

---

## 4. Prometheus Basics

Prometheus is a pull-based metrics system that scrapes HTTP endpoints exposing
metrics in its text format.

### Scrape Configuration

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "api-server"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["api-server:8080"]
    metrics_path: /metrics
  - job_name: "kubernetes-pods"
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
        action: keep
        regex: true
```

### Key PromQL Queries

```promql
rate(http_requests_total[5m])                                    # request rate
histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))  # p99
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
  / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))                           # error ratio
```

### Alerting Rules

```yaml
groups:
  - name: api-alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: |
          sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
          / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) > 0.05
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Error rate above 5% for 5 minutes"
          runbook_url: "https://wiki.internal/runbooks/high-error-rate"
```

---

## 5. Grafana Dashboards

**Data sources**: Prometheus, Loki, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, CloudWatch, others.

**Panel types**: Time series (metrics over time), Stat (single value), Table
(top-N lists), Heatmap (latency distribution), Logs (inline log viewer).

**Template variables**: Define `$namespace`, `$service`, `$instance` at the
dashboard level. Use in queries to make one dashboard serve many teams.

**Alerts**: Grafana 9+ has a unified alerting engine. Define rules on panels,
route notifications to Slack, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie via notification policies
matched by label.

---

## 6. Log Aggregation

### ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Elasticsearch stores and full-text indexes logs.
- Logstash ingests, transforms, and ships logs.
- Kibana provides query, visualization, and dashboards.
- Resource-heavy. Suited for large organizations with platform teams.

### Loki (Lightweight Alternative)
- Indexes logs only by labels, not full text. Much cheaper to operate.
- LogQL query language is similar to PromQL.
- Pairs naturally with Grafana. Use Promtail or Grafana Agent to ship logs.

**When to choose**: Need full-text search across all fields? ELK. Need
cost-effective storage with label-based queries? Loki. Already running
Prometheus and Grafana? Loki reduces operational overhead.

---

## 7. Alerting Strategy

### Alert Fatigue
Every alert must be actionable. If no one needs to act, remove it. Prefer
alerting on symptoms (users affected) over causes (CPU is high).

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Meaning | Response |
|----------|---------|----------|
| P1 / Critical | Service down or data loss | Page immediately |
| P2 / High | Degraded, partial outage | Page during business hours |
| P3 / Medium | Non-urgent, workaround exists | Ticket, fix within days |
| P4 / Low | Cosmetic or minor | Backlog |

### Runbooks
Every alert should link to a runbook containing: what the alert means, how to
verify, steps to mitigate, escalation contacts, and relevant dashboard links.
Keep runbooks in version control alongside alerting rules.

### Notification Routing (PagerDuty, OpsGenie)
Route P1/P2 to on-call paging tools. Route P3/P4 to Slack or ticketing systems.
Configure escalation policies so the secondary is paged if the primary does not
acknowledge within N minutes.

---

## 8. SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets

**SLI (Service Level Indicator)**: A quantitative measure of a service aspect.
Examples: availability (% successful requests), latency (% requests < threshold).

**SLO (Service Level Objective)**: A target for an SLI over a time window.
Example: 99.9% of requests succeed over a 30-day rolling window.

**Error budget**: The allowed unreliability: `1 - SLO`. A 99.9% SLO gives 0.1%
budget (roughly 43 minutes of downtime per 30 days). When the budget is nearly
exhausted, freeze releases and focus on reliability.

**Tips**: Start with one or two SLOs per service. Measure from the client
perspective (load balancer logs, synthetic probes). Review in weekly reliability
meetings.

---

## 9. Health Checks and Readiness Probes

- **Liveness**: "Is the process alive?" Kubernetes restarts the pod on failure.
  Keep it simple: return 200 if the event loop is running.
- **Readiness**: "Can it accept traffic?" Kubernetes removes the pod from the
  load balancer on failure. Check dependencies (DB pool, cache).
- **Startup**: Prevents liveness checks from killing slow-starting containers.

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet: { path: /healthz, port: 8080 }
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
readinessProbe:
  httpGet: { path: /ready, port: 8080 }
  periodSeconds: 5
```

---

## 10. The RED Method (Application Metrics)

For request-driven services, dashboard these three signals:

| Signal | Measure | Example Metric |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Rate | Requests per second | `rate(http_requests_total[5m])` |
| Errors | Failed requests per second | `rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])` |
| Duration | Latency (p50, p95, p99) | `histogram_quantile(0.95, ...)` |

Alert when error rate or latency exceeds SLO thresholds.

---

## 11. The USE Method (Infrastructure Metrics)

For resources (CPU, memory, disk, network):

| Signal | Definition | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Utilization | % of resource busy | CPU at 85% |
| Saturation | Queued work beyond capacity | Run queue > core count |
| Errors | Error events | Disk I/O errors, packet drops |

High utilization alone is not a problem. High saturation means the resource is
a bottleneck. Infrastructure bottlenecks often manifest as increased request
latency (linking USE back to RED).

---

## 12. Uptime Monitoring

**Synthetic checks**: Automated scripts simulating user actions from multiple
regions. Tools: Grafana Synthetic Monitoring, Checkly, Pingdom.

**Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Collects performance data from actual browsers.
Measures page load, time to interactive, core web vitals. Captures real network
conditions and device diversity that synthetics cannot.

**Status pages**: Publish service status externally (Statuspage, Instatus).
Automate updates from alert state changes when possible.

---

## 13. Incident Response Workflow

1. **Detect** -- Alerts fire, users report issues, synthetic checks fail.
2. **Triage** -- Assess scope and affected users. Assign severity. Open an
   incident channel.
3. **Mitigate** -- Restore service first; root cause comes later. Rollback,
   scale up, toggle feature flags, failover. Communicate at regular intervals.
4. **Resolve** -- Confirm metrics returned to normal. Close incident channel and
   update status page.
5. **Postmortem** -- Write a blameless postmortem within 48 hours. Include
   timeline, root cause, impact, what went well, and action items. Track items
   to completion.

---

## 14. Dashboards to Build First

1. **Service overview**: RED metrics per service (rate, errors, duration).
2. **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk, network per node/pod (USE).
3. **SLO tracker**: Current SLI values, error budget remaining, burn rate.
4. **Deployment overlay**: Deploy events on error rate and latency graphs.
5. **Database**: Query rate, slow queries, connection pool, replication lag.
6. **Queue/worker**: Enqueue rate, dequeue rate, queue depth, processing time.

---

## 15. Anti-Patterns

- **Alert on everything**: Creates noise and on-call burnout. Alert on
  user-facing symptoms, not every internal metric.
- **No runbooks**: Engineers paged at 3 AM with no response guidance. Link every
  alert to a runbook and update it after incidents.
- **Metrics without context**: Dashboards full of unexplained numbers. Add panel
  descriptions, deployment annotations, and threshold lines.
- **Logging sensitive data**: PII or secrets in logs create compliance risk.
  Sanitize fields before logging.
- **Ignoring cardinality**: Unbounded label values (user IDs, request IDs) in
  metrics explode storage and slow queries. Use high-cardinality data in logs
  and traces instead.
- **No cross-pillar correlation**: Metrics, logs, and traces in separate silos.
  Include trace IDs in logs, add exemplars to metrics, use tooling that
  supports cross-referencing (Grafana with Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo).
