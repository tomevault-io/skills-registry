# mock-capture

Capture a live provider chat page and generate a mock simulation HTML for E2E
testing. Replaces the old Playwright-based `mockCapture.ts` by delegating
browser control to actionbook and processing to a pure Node script.

## Supported providers

| Key | URL |
|------|------|
| `chatgpt` | https://chatgpt.com/ |
| `claude` | https://claude.ai/ |
| `gemini` | https://gemini.google.com/ |
| `grok` | https://grok.com/ |
| `perplexity` | https://www.perplexity.ai/ |
| `aistudio` | https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Open real website with actionbook

Use the user's already-logged-in browser via actionbook extension or CDP mode.

```bash
# Find selectors for the provider (optional — for later validation)
actionbook search "<provider> chat page"
actionbook get <manual-id>

# Open the provider URL
actionbook browser open "<provider-url>"
```

Wait for the page to fully load. If the user needs to log in, tell them and
wait for confirmation before continuing.

### Phase 2: Capture DOM

```bash
# Grab the full rendered HTML
actionbook browser html > /tmp/<provider>-raw.html
```

Verify the file is non-empty and contains expected elements (e.g. a chat
container or input area).

### Phase 3: Process

Run the pure processing script to clean DOM, inject sentinels, generate
runtime, and write the simulation file:

```bash
bun scripts/lib/mockCaptureProcess.ts --provider <key> --input /tmp/<provider>-raw.html
```

This outputs to `tests/fixtures/mock-site/<key>-simulation.html` and updates
`mock-provider-config.json`.

### Phase 4: Validate (recommended)

Open the generated mock page and verify it works:

```bash
# Open generated file in browser
actionbook browser open "file://$(pwd)/tests/fixtures/mock-site/<key>-simulation.html"

# Take a snapshot to visually verify
actionbook browser snapshot

# Check that the input area and submit button exist
actionbook browser eval "document.querySelector('<input-selector>') !== null"
actionbook browser eval "document.querySelector('<submit-selector>') !== null"
```

Optionally run the E2E test suite to confirm no regressions:

```bash
bun run test:unit
```

### Phase 5: Cleanup

```bash
actionbook browser close
rm /tmp/<provider>-raw.html
```

## Multi-provider capture

To capture all providers in sequence, repeat Phases 1-5 for each key. Between
providers, close the current tab and open the next URL.

## Troubleshooting

- **Login required**: Tell the user to log in manually in their browser, then
  retry the `actionbook browser html` step.
- **Empty HTML**: The page may not have loaded fully. Wait a few seconds and
  retry `actionbook browser html`.
- **Selector mismatch after capture**: The provider may have updated their DOM.
  Check the inject config in `src/providers/<key>/inject.ts` and update
  selectors if needed.
