## Writing Principles

### Clarity

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use simple, direct language | Use jargon without explanation |
| One idea per paragraph | Write dense walls of text |
| Active voice ("Run the command") | Passive voice ("The command should be run") |
| Specific examples | Abstract explanations |

### Structure

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Start with most important info | Bury key info in paragraphs |
| Use headers to organize | Write long unstructured sections |
| Use lists for 3+ related items | Use paragraphs for lists |
| Include code examples | Describe without showing |

### Audience

| Audience | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Beginners | Explain concepts, avoid assumptions |
| Developers | Focus on API, code examples |
| Users | Task-oriented, step-by-step |
| Contributors | Architecture, conventions |

---

## Code Examples

### Good Example

```python
# Install the package
pip install mypackage

# Import and use
from mypackage import Client

client = Client(api_key="your-key")
result = client.get_data()
print(result)
```

### Bad Example

```python
# This is a comprehensive example showing all the features
# of the package including advanced configuration options
# and error handling patterns that you might need...
from mypackage import Client, Config, ErrorHandler
# ... 50 more lines
```

**Key Rule**: Examples should be minimal and focused. Show one concept at a time.

---

## Formatting Guidelines

### Headers

- Use sentence case: "Getting started" not "Getting Started"
- Maximum 3 levels deep (##, ###, ####)
- Headers should be descriptive and scannable

### Code Blocks

- Always specify language for syntax highlighting
- Keep examples short (< 20 lines ideally)
- Include comments only when necessary

### Tables

Use tables for:
- Parameter/option descriptions
- Feature comparisons
- Reference data

### Links

- Use descriptive link text: "See the [installation guide](./install.md)"
- Not: "Click [here](./install.md)"
