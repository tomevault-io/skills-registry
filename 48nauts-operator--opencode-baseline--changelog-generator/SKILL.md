# Changelog Generator

Transform technical git commits into polished, user-friendly changelogs that customers understand.

## When to Use

- Preparing release notes for a new version
- Creating weekly/monthly product update summaries
- Writing changelog entries for app stores
- Generating customer-facing update notifications
- Maintaining a public changelog page

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

```
Create a changelog from commits since last release
```

```
Generate changelog for commits from the past week
```

```
Create release notes for version 2.5.0
```

### With Date Range

```
Create changelog for commits between March 1 and March 15
```

### With Tag Range

```
Generate changelog for commits between v1.0.0 and v2.0.0
```

## Process

### 1. Gather Commits

```bash
# Since last tag
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline

# Between tags
git log v1.0.0..v2.0.0 --oneline

# By date range
git log --after="2025-01-01" --before="2025-01-15" --oneline
```

### 2. Categorize Changes

| Category | Commit Prefixes | Emoji |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| New Features | feat, add | ✨ |
| Improvements | improve, enhance, update | 🔧 |
| Bug Fixes | fix, resolve, patch | 🐛 |
| Breaking Changes | breaking, !: | 💥 |
| Security | security, vuln | 🔒 |
| Performance | perf, optimize | ⚡ |

### 3. Translate to User Language

| Technical Commit | User-Friendly |
|------------------|---------------|
| "fix: resolve null ptr in auth handler" | "Fixed login issues for some users" |
| "feat: implement websocket reconnection" | "App now automatically reconnects when connection drops" |
| "perf: optimize query with index" | "Dashboard loads 2x faster" |

### 4. Filter Noise

Exclude from changelog:
- refactor: (internal code changes)
- test: (test updates)
- chore: (maintenance)
- ci: (pipeline changes)
- docs: (unless user-facing)
