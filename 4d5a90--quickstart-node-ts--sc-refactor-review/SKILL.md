name: sc-refactor-review
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "review code", "find dead code", "check for duplication", "simplify the codebase", "find refactoring opportunities", "do code cleanup", "check naming consistency", "analyze test organization", "run codebase health check", "review my PR", "refactor this code", "extract method", "rename variable", or "consolidate duplicates". Routes to specialized analysis agents or refactoring workflow based on the type of request. Use when this capability is needed.

# SC Refactor Review Skill

Reference guide for routing review and refactoring requests to specialized agents.

## Quick Reference

### Commands

| Command | Use When | Invokes |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `/sc-refactor:sc-refactor` | Refactor code (plan or execute) | sc-refactor-planner + sc-refactor-executor |
| `/sc-refactor:sc-review-pr` | Reviewing a PR for quality with ticket context | sc-code-reviewer + sc-structural-reviewer |
| `/sc-refactor:sc-pr-comments` | View unresolved PR review comments | Scripts (GraphQL) |
| `/sc-refactor:sc-resolve-pr-parallel` | Batch resolve all PR comments | sc-pr-comment-resolver (parallel) |
| `/sc-refactor:sc-cleanup` | Post-AI session cleanup (debug statements, duplicates) | 4 agents (dead-code, duplication, naming, test) |
| `/sc-refactor:sc-audit` | Verify structural completeness (wiring, configs) | sc-structural-reviewer |
| `/sc-refactor:sc-codebase-health` | Full codebase analysis | All 6 agents in parallel |

### Agents

| Agent | Focus | Color |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `sc-refactor-planner` | Analyze code, recommend refactoring opportunities | yellow |
| `sc-refactor-executor` | Execute ONE surgical refactoring with test verification | green |
| `sc-structural-reviewer` | Change completeness, orphaned code, dev artifacts | blue |
| `sc-duplication-hunter` | Copy-paste, structural, logic duplication | yellow |
| `sc-abstraction-critic` | YAGNI violations, over-engineering, wrapper hell | orange |
| `sc-naming-auditor` | Convention violations, semantic drift | cyan |
| `sc-dead-code-detector` | Unreferenced exports, orphan files, commented code | red |
| `sc-test-organizer` | Test structure, missing tests, fixture sprawl | green |
| `sc-pr-comment-resolver` | Implement PR review comment changes | blue |

External dependency (from simpleclaude-core):
- `sc-code-reviewer` - Bugs, security, CLAUDE.md compliance

## Routing Table

Match the user's request to the appropriate command or agents:

| User Intent | Route To |
|-------------|----------|
| "refactor", "extract method", "rename", "consolidate", "inline" | `/sc-refactor` |
| "refactoring opportunities", "what should I refactor" | `/sc-refactor` (plan mode) |
| "review PR", "check my PR", "PR review" | `/sc-review-pr` |
| "PR comments", "view comments", "unresolved comments" | `/sc-pr-comments` |
| "resolve comments", "fix PR feedback", "address review" | `/sc-resolve-pr-parallel` |
| "clean up", "after AI session", "find debug", "console.log" | `/sc-cleanup` |
| "audit", "structural check", "verify wiring", "missing config" | `/sc-audit` |
| "health check", "full analysis", "comprehensive" | `/sc-codebase-health` |
| "dead code", "unused", "orphan" | sc-dead-code-detector |
| "duplicate", "DRY", "repeated" | sc-duplication-hunter |
| "simplify", "YAGNI", "over-engineer" | sc-abstraction-critic |
| "naming", "consistency", "convention" | sc-naming-auditor |
| "test organization", "test structure" | sc-test-organizer |
| "structural", "complete changes" | sc-structural-reviewer |

## Agent Spawning

### Single Agent

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "sc-refactor:sc-[agent-name]",
  prompt: "Analyze [target] for [focus area]. Report findings with confidence scores."
)
```

### Multiple Agents (Parallel)

Spawn all relevant agents in a single message with `run_in_background: true`:

```
Task(subagent_type: "sc-refactor:sc-duplication-hunter", run_in_background: true, prompt: "...")
Task(subagent_type: "sc-refactor:sc-abstraction-critic", run_in_background: true, prompt: "...")
```

### Full Health Check (6 Agents)

```
Task(subagent_type: "sc-refactor:sc-structural-reviewer", run_in_background: true, ...)
Task(subagent_type: "sc-refactor:sc-duplication-hunter", run_in_background: true, ...)
Task(subagent_type: "sc-refactor:sc-abstraction-critic", run_in_background: true, ...)
Task(subagent_type: "sc-refactor:sc-naming-auditor", run_in_background: true, ...)
Task(subagent_type: "sc-refactor:sc-dead-code-detector", run_in_background: true, ...)
Task(subagent_type: "sc-refactor:sc-test-organizer", run_in_background: true, ...)
```

## Output Synthesis

After agents complete, synthesize findings by priority:

```
## [Category] Analysis

### High Priority (confidence >= 90)
- [finding]: [description] ([file:line])

### Medium Priority (confidence 80-89)
- [finding]: [description] ([file:line])

### Recommendations
- [actionable next step]
```

## Command Details

### sc-review-pr

Context-aware PR review with ticket integration. Gathers:
- PR metadata (title, body, commits, changed files)
- Linked ticket context (Jira, GitHub Issues, beads)
- Relevant CLAUDE.md guidelines

Then runs parallel review agents focused on the PR diff.

### sc-cleanup

Post-AI session cleanup. Spawns 4 agents to find:
- Debug statements (console.log, print, debugger, binding.pry)
- Code duplication (AI rewrote instead of reusing)
- Naming inconsistencies
- Test organization issues

Offers auto-fix for immediate issues (debug removal, dead code deletion).

### sc-audit

Structural completeness verification. Uses sc-structural-reviewer to check:
- Route registration
- ENV variable documentation
- Database migrations
- Barrel file exports
- Documentation updates
- Related file renames (CSS, tests, stories)

Reports PASS/FAIL per category with fix suggestions.

### sc-refactor

Surgical code refactoring workflow with two modes:

**Plan Mode** (no specific action given):
1. Invokes sc-refactor-planner to analyze target
2. Presents prioritized recommendations
3. User selects one to execute

**Execute Mode** (specific action given):
1. Invokes sc-refactor-executor with the specific refactoring
2. Executor runs tests, makes change, verifies behavior preserved
3. Reports success/failure with files modified

Example usage:
- `/sc-refactor src/utils` - Analyze for opportunities
- `/sc-refactor extract duplicate validation in auth.ts` - Execute specific refactoring

Key constraints:
- ONE refactoring per invocation
- Tests must pass before and after
- Zero behavioral changes
- Does NOT auto-commit

### sc-codebase-health

Comprehensive health check running all 6 agents in parallel. Produces:
- Executive summary
- Quick wins (fixable in <30 min)
- Recommended refactors
- Tech debt backlog
- Items to skip (not worth effort)

Offers auto-fix for quick wins after analysis.
