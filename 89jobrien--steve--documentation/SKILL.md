## API Documentation

### Document as You Build

- Document APIs during development, not after
- Keep documentation in sync with code
- Use real examples over abstract descriptions
- Show both success and error cases
- Version everything including docs

### OpenAPI Specification

**Structure:**

- API metadata (title, version, description)
- Server definitions
- Security schemes
- Paths and operations
- Request/response schemas
- Examples for all operations

**Example:**

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: User API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: API for user management

paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: List users
      responses:
        '200':
          description: List of users
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
```

### SDK Generation

**Supported Languages:**

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python

- SDK generators

### Code Examples

Provide examples in multiple languages:

- JavaScript/Node.js
- Python
- cURL
- Ruby
- Java

## Technical Writing

### Write for Your Audience

- Know their skill level
- Use appropriate terminology
- Provide context when needed
- Assume minimal prior knowledge
- Include troubleshooting sections

### Lead with the Outcome

- Start with what users will accomplish
- Show the value before the steps
- Use clear, action-oriented language
- Focus on user success, not features

### Use Active Voice

- Prefer active over passive voice
- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid jargon when possible
- Include real examples and scenarios
- Test instructions by following them exactly

### Documentation Types

**User Guides:**

- Overview and goals
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step instructions
- Screenshots or examples
- Troubleshooting
- Next steps

**README Files:**

- Project title and description
- Badges (build status, version, license)
- Features
- Installation
- Quick start
- Usage examples
- Contributing
- License

**Architecture Docs:**

- System overview
- Component diagrams
- Design decisions
- Technology choices
- Integration points
- Data flow

## Changelog Generation

### Transforming Git Commits

Automatically creates user-facing changelogs from git commits by:

- Analyzing commit history
- Categorizing changes (features, improvements, bug fixes, breaking changes, security)
- Transforming technical commits into clear, customer-friendly release notes
- Filtering out internal commits (refactoring, tests, etc.)

### Basic Usage

```
Create a changelog from commits since last release
```

```
Generate changelog for all commits from the past week
```

```
Create release notes for version 2.5.0
```

### With Specific Date Range

```
Create a changelog for all commits between March 1 and March 15
```

### With Custom Guidelines

```
Create a changelog for commits since v2.4.0, using my changelog
guidelines from CHANGELOG_STYLE.md
```

### Example Output

```markdown
# Updates - Week of March 10, 2024

## ✨ New Features

- **`references/api_docs.md`** - API documentation patterns, OpenAPI specifications, SDK generation, versioning strategies, and code examples
- **`references/technical_writing.md`** - Technical writing best practices, user guide structure, README templates, architecture documentation, and content organization
- **`references/changelogs.md`** - Changelog generation patterns, commit categorization, user-friendly transformation, and release note best practices
