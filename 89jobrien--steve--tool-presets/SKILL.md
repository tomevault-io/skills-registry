# Tool Presets Skill

Standardized tool set definitions for Claude Code agents. Use these presets to ensure consistent tool access across similar agent types.

## Available Presets

| Preset | Tools | Best For |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `dev-tools` | Read, Write, Edit, Bash | Development/coding agents |
| `file-ops` | Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob | File manipulation agents |
| `analysis` | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash | Code analysis agents |
| `research` | Read, Write, WebSearch, WebFetch | Research agents |
| `orchestration` | Read, Write, Edit, Task, TodoWrite | Coordinator agents |
| `full-stack` | All tools | Comprehensive agents |

## Usage

Reference a preset in your agent's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-agent
description: Agent description
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash  # Use dev-tools preset pattern
skills: tool-presets
---
```
