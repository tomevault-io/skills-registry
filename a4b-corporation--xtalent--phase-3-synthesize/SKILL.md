# Phase 3: Synthesize DRD

Transform analysis results into a complete, well-structured Domain Requirement Document.

## Trigger

Execute when:
- Phase 2 analysis-report.md is available
- DRD regeneration requested

## Process

### Step 1: Load Analysis Results

Read:
1. `_output/_logs/analysis-report.md`
2. `_input/project-context.md` (for header info)

### Step 2: Generate DRD Structure

Create: `_output/00-drd/DRD-[module].md`

Follow the template below exactly.

### Step 3: Write Each Section

#### Section 1: Context
- Copy from project-context.md
- Add scope from analysis

#### Section 2: Domain Concepts
- Transform consolidated entities into concept descriptions
- Write in natural language, not YAML
- Include "key characteristics" for each
- Mark confidence inline

#### Section 3: Business Rules
- Organize rules by category
- Use consistent ID format
- Include conditions and actions

#### Section 4: Workflows
- Write full workflow descriptions
- Include main flow and alternates
- Reference entities by name

#### Section 5: Data Examples
- Generate realistic examples
- Show different scenarios
- Use YAML format for clarity

#### Section 6: Integration Points
- List external system integrations
- Specify data direction and purpose

### Step 4: Add Metadata

- Confidence markers throughout
- Source attributions
- Assumptions section
- Open questions section

### Step 5: Self-Review

Before finalizing:
- [ ] All analysis entities covered?
- [ ] All workflows included?
- [ ] Business rules linked to entities/workflows?
- [ ] Examples are realistic?
- [ ] No TODO placeholders?

**Verification Rules**:
- FAIL if missing required sections
- FAIL if TODO/TBD placeholders remain

## Quality Checklist

Before proceeding to Phase 4:
- [ ] All consolidated entities from analysis appear in Section 2
- [ ] All workflows from analysis appear in Section 4
- [ ] All business rules have IDs and are linked
- [ ] Examples are realistic and consistent
- [ ] Assumptions clearly documented
- [ ] Confidence markers throughout

## Next Phase

After completing DRD:
→ Load `phase-4-generate/SKILL.md`
