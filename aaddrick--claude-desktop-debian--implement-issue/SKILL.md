# Implement Issue

End-to-end issue implementation via orchestrator script.

**Announce at start:** "Using implement-issue to run orchestrator for #$ISSUE against $BRANCH"

**Arguments:**
- `$1` — GitHub issue number (required)
- `$2` — Base branch name (required)

## Invocation

Immediately launch the orchestrator:

```bash
.claude/scripts/implement-issue-orchestrator.sh \
  --issue $ISSUE_NUMBER \
  --branch $BASE_BRANCH
```

Or with explicit agent override:

```bash
.claude/scripts/implement-issue-orchestrator.sh \
  --issue $ISSUE_NUMBER \
  --branch $BASE_BRANCH \
  --agent patch-engineer
```

## Monitoring

Check progress via status.json:

```bash
jq . status.json
```

Watch live:

```bash
watch -n 5 'jq -c "{state,stage:.current_stage,task:.current_task,quality:.quality_iterations}" status.json'
```
