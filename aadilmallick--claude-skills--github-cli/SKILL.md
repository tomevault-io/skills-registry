# GitHub Info

## Overview

Retrieve comprehensive GitHub information using the GitHub CLI (`gh`) tool. This skill provides scripts and commands to fetch user profile data, repository statistics, and other GitHub-related information.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Run `gh auth login` if not already authenticated

## Quick Start

### Get Profile Information

Use the `gh_profile.sh` script to retrieve your GitHub profile:

```bash
bash scripts/gh_profile.sh
```

This displays:
- Username, name, and bio
- Company and location
- Email and blog
- Follower/following counts
- Public repository and gist counts
- Account creation and update dates

### Get Repository Information

Use the `gh_repos.sh` script to list your repositories:

```bash
# Get top 10 repositories (default)
bash scripts/gh_repos.sh

# Get top 20 repositories
bash scripts/gh_repos.sh --limit 20

# Sort by creation date
bash scripts/gh_repos.sh --sort created
```

This displays for each repository:
- Repository name and description
- Primary language
- Star and fork counts
- Private/public status
- Last update date

## Direct gh CLI Usage

For queries not covered by the scripts, use `gh` directly:

```bash
# Get specific user information
gh api user --jq '.login, .name, .bio'

# List repositories with custom fields
gh repo list --json name,stargazerCount --jq '.[] | "\(.name): \(.stargazerCount) stars"'

# Get total stars across all repos
gh api user/repos --paginate --jq '[.[] | .stargazers_count] | add'
```
