# Resume Builder Skill

## Overview

This skill creates professional, ATS-optimized resumes using LaTeX based on the Jake Ryan template. It follows industry best practices from Tech Interview Handbook and generates both LaTeX source files and compiled PDFs.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Create a professional resume from scratch
- Improve an existing resume with quantifiable achievements
- Generate targeted resume variants (e.g., SWE vs ML focus)
- Ensure ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility
- Format resumes following FAANG hiring standards

## Core Principles

### The Three Pillars

1. **Quantifiable Achievements** - Every bullet point should include measurable impact
2. **ATS Optimization** - Single-column layout, standard fonts, keyword-rich
3. **Strategic Marketing** - Show impact, not just responsibilities

### Critical Rules

- **Always generate BOTH .tex and .pdf files**
- **Maximum 2 bullets per experience/project** unless specifically requested
- **Use original content** - never fabricate achievements
- **Single page** for early career (<5 years experience)
- **PDF compiled from LaTeX** for text highlightability

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Gather Information

Before creating a resume, collect:

**Personal Information:**

- Full name
- Phone number
- Email (professional format: `firstname.lastname@domain.com`)
- LinkedIn URL
- GitHub URL
- Location (optional)

**Education:**

- Institution name and location
- Degree, major, minor (if applicable)
- GPA (if 3.5+)
- Graduation date
- Relevant coursework (3-5 courses max)

**Experience:**

- Company name and location
- Job title
- Employment dates
- 2-3 bullet points per position with quantifiable results

**Projects:**

- Project name
- Technologies used
- GitHub repository URL
- Live demo URL
- 1-2 bullet points with metrics (users, performance, impact)

**Skills:**

- Programming languages
- Frameworks and libraries
- Databases
- Tools and technologies
- Specializations

### Step 2: Apply Content Strategy

For every bullet point, use the **PAR Method**:

- **P**roblem: What challenge existed?
- **A**ction: What did you do?
- **R**esult: What quantifiable outcome occurred?

**Formula:** Action Verb + Technical Task + Quantifiable Result

**Examples:**

❌ Bad: "Developed a web application"
✅ Good: "Built Flask web application reducing API response time by 40% for 10,000+ monthly users"

❌ Bad: "Worked on monitoring system"
✅ Good: "Architected Kubernetes monitoring system for 112+ websites, reducing incident detection from 2 hours to 5 minutes"

### Step 3: Optimize for ATS

**Format Requirements:**

- Single-column layout (CRITICAL for ATS)
- Standard fonts (included in template)
- No graphics, images, or photos
- No tables for main content
- No multi-column layouts
- Section headers must be clear: Education, Experience, Projects, Technical Skills

**Keyword Strategy:**

1. Read target job description 3 times
2. Extract technical keywords (languages, frameworks, tools, methodologies)
3. Include both acronyms AND full phrases (e.g., "ML" and "Machine Learning")
4. Place keywords in:
   - Professional Summary (highest ATS weight)
   - Skills Section (exact job description terminology)
   - Experience descriptions (woven into achievements)

### Step 4: Create LaTeX File

Use the template structure from `TEMPLATE.tex`. Key sections in order:

1. **Header** - Name and contact information
2. **Professional Summary** (optional but recommended) - 3-4 sentences, <50 words
3. **Education** - Reverse chronological order
4. **Experience** - Reverse chronological, 2-3 bullets each
5. **Projects** - Most impressive first, include GitHub/Demo links
6. **Technical Skills** - Grouped by category

**Project Header Format:**

```latex
\resumeProjectHeading
    {\textbf{Project Name} $|$ \emph{Tech Stack} $|$ \href{github-url}{\underline{Github}} $|$ \href{demo-url}{\underline{Demo}}}{Year}
```

### Step 5: Compile to PDF

Always compile using pdflatex:

```bash
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode resume.tex
```

This ensures:

- Text is highlightable (ATS requirement)
- Professional formatting is preserved
- Hyperlinks are functional

### Step 6: Output Files

Always provide to user:

1. `[name]_resume.tex` - LaTeX source file
2. `[name]_resume.pdf` - Compiled PDF
3. Copy both to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`
4. Use `present_files` tool to share with user

## Creating Resume Variants

For targeted applications, create variants by asking the user what they want or use one of the variants below.

**SWE Variant:**

- Focus on: Full-stack development, production systems, TypeScript/React
- Remove: Heavy ML/research content
- Emphasize: System design, scalability, user-facing features

**ML/AI Variant:**

- Focus on: Research, model development, data pipelines
- Remove: Pure frontend work
- Emphasize: Frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow), research papers, metrics

**Each Variant Must:**

- Fit on single page
- Have unique filename (e.g., `resume_swe.tex`, `resume_ml.tex`)
- Maintain 2 bullets max per item
- Use only original user content

## Quantification Guidelines

### Types of Metrics to Include

**Performance Improvements:**

- "Reduced latency by 200ms"
- "Improved page load time from 3.2s to 0.8s"
- "Decreased API response time by 40%"

**Scale:**

- "Serving 1M+ users"
- "Processing 50,000+ requests/day"
- "Monitoring 112+ websites"

**Business Impact:**

- "Reduced incident detection from 2 hours to 5 minutes"
- "Improved uptime by 15%"
- "Saved $50K/year in infrastructure costs"

**Code Quality:**

- "Reduced runtime errors by 25%"
- "Improved test coverage from 60% to 95%"
- "Decreased production exceptions by 40%"

**User Engagement:**

- "Increased user retention by 30%"
- "Achieved 1,000+ active users"
- "Garnered 4.7/5 rating with 836+ reviews"

### When Metrics Aren't Available

If user doesn't have exact numbers:

1. Ask clarifying questions to help them estimate
2. Use comparative statements ("significantly improved", "substantially reduced")
3. Focus on scope ("team of 5", "across 3 departments")
4. **Never fabricate numbers**

## Action Verbs by Category

**Development:**

- Engineered, Architected, Implemented, Built, Designed, Developed, Programmed

**Optimization:**

- Streamlined, Optimized, Enhanced, Improved, Accelerated, Refactored

**Leadership:**

- Led, Mentored, Spearheaded, Coordinated, Directed, Managed

**Analysis:**

- Analyzed, Evaluated, Assessed, Investigated, Researched

**Innovation:**

- Pioneered, Innovated, Transformed, Created, Launched

**Collaboration:**

- Collaborated, Partnered, Coordinated, Facilitated

## Professional Summary Template

**Structure (3-4 sentences, <50 words):**

```
[Your Role/Level] with [X years/internships] in [specializations]. 
[Key achievement with metric]. 
[Notable accomplishment or publication]. 
Proficient in [top 3-5 technologies].
```

**Example:**

```
Computer Science & Applied Mathematics student at William & Mary with expertise 
in AI/ML, full-stack development, and distributed systems. Architected Kubernetes 
monitoring system reducing incident detection time from hours to minutes. Published 
20,000-word technical article garnering 836+ claps. Proficient in Python, 
TypeScript, React, PyTorch, and Docker.
```

### Technical Mistakes

❌ PDF not text-highlightable
❌ Hidden keywords in white text
❌ Missing both acronym and full form
❌ Not tailoring to job description
❌ Skills section doesn't match job requirements
