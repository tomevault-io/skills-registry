# Code Review

Comprehensive code review for quality, performance, and architecture across all languages.

## Quick Start

### Automated Review

Run complete analysis:
```bash
./scripts/review_code.sh /path/to/code
```

This runs:
- Language-specific linters (ESLint, Pylint, Clippy)
- Complexity analysis
- Code smell detection
- Report generation

### Manual Review

Use comprehensive checklist:
- See [review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md) for complete checklist

### Individual Analyzers

**Complexity analysis:**
```bash
./scripts/analyze_complexity.py /path/to/code
```

**Code smells:**
```bash
./scripts/detect_code_smells.py /path/to/code
```

## When to Use

**Trigger this skill when:**
- User says "review this code" or similar
- After significant code implementation
- Before committing/creating PRs
- Analyzing unfamiliar codebases
- Investigating quality issues
- Optimizing performance
- Refactoring

## What This Skill Provides

### Automated Analysis Scripts

**`review_code.sh`** - Complete review orchestrator
- Detects project type (JS/TS/Python/Rust)
- Runs appropriate linters
- Analyzes complexity
- Detects code smells
- Generates comprehensive report

**`analyze_complexity.py`** - Complexity metrics
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Function length
- Nesting depth
- Identifies problematic functions

**`detect_code_smells.py`** - Code smell detection
- Long parameter lists
- Magic numbers
- Duplicated code
- Deep nesting
- God classes

**`generate_review_report.py`** - Report generation
- Aggregates all findings
- Prioritizes issues
- Provides recommendations

### Manual Review Guidance

**[review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md)** - Complete review checklist
- Code quality checks
- Performance considerations
- Architecture review
- Security checklist
- Testing coverage

**[code-smells.md](references/code-smells.md)** - Code smell catalog
- Common smells by category
- Detection strategies
- Refactoring solutions

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. Code Quality
- Naming and readability
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Consistent style
- Proper comments

### 2. Performance
- Algorithmic complexity
- Unnecessary loops/nesting
- Database query optimization
- Memory management
- Caching opportunities

### 3. Architecture
- Modularity and organization
- SOLID principles
- Coupling and cohesion
- Dependency management
- Design patterns

### 4. Code Smells
- Bloaters (long methods, large classes)
- Object-orientation abusers
- Change preventers
- Dispensables (dead code, duplication)
- Couplers (tight coupling)

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Complete Project Review

```bash
# Run automated analysis
./scripts/review_code.sh /path/to/project

# Review output
cat .code-review-output/REVIEW.md

# Manual checklist review
# Consult references/review-checklist.md

# Address findings
# Refactor based on recommendations
```

### Workflow 2: Quick Complexity Check

```bash
# Analyze complexity
./scripts/analyze_complexity.py /path/to/code

# Identify complex functions
# Refactor functions with complexity >10
```

### Workflow 3: Pre-Commit Review

1. Run automated review
2. Check for high-severity issues
3. Review manual checklist
4. Ensure tests pass
5. Commit if approved

### Workflow 4: Legacy Code Analysis

1. Run full review to understand codebase
2. Identify problematic areas
3. Prioritize refactoring
4. Address incrementally

## Understanding Results

### Complexity Metrics

**Cyclomatic Complexity:**
- 1-5: Simple, easy to test
- 6-10: Moderate complexity
- 11-20: High complexity, consider refactoring
- 21+: Very high, definitely refactor

**Function Length:**
- ≤20 lines: Excellent
- 21-50 lines: Good
- 51-100 lines: Consider splitting
- 100+ lines: Refactor

**Nesting Depth:**
- 1-2 levels: Good
- 3-4 levels: Acceptable
- 5+ levels: Refactor

### Code Smell Severity

**High** - Address immediately:
- God classes
- Duplicated critical logic
- Deep nesting in hot paths

**Medium** - Address soon:
- Long parameter lists
- Feature envy
- Duplicated code

**Low** - Address when convenient:
- Magic numbers
- Minor duplication
- Speculative generality

## Language Support

### Detected Automatically

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
- ESLint integration
- TypeScript compiler checks
- Complexity analysis
- Code smell detection

**Python:**
- Pylint integration
- Flake8 support
- MyPy type checking
- Complexity analysis

**Rust:**
- Clippy integration
- Cargo check
- Basic complexity analysis

### Additional Languages

For languages not automatically detected:
- Manual checklist still applies
- Use language-specific linters
- Complexity principles are universal

## Best Practices

1. **Review Early** - Don't wait until code is "complete"
2. **Focus on Impact** - High-severity issues first
3. **Be Constructive** - Suggest improvements, not just problems
4. **Consider Context** - Performance vs. readability tradeoffs
5. **Automate** - Use tools before manual review
6. **Test Changes** - Ensure refactoring doesn't break functionality
7. **Document Decisions** - Explain WHY, not just WHAT
8. **Iterate** - Re-review after changes

## Integration

### CI/CD Integration

Add to GitHub Actions:
```yaml
- name: Code Review
  run: |
    ./scripts/review_code.sh .
    # Fail if high-severity issues found
```

### Pre-commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
./scripts/review_code.sh . --quick
```

### Editor Integration

Most linters integrate with VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.

## Limitations

- **Static Analysis Only** - Doesn't catch runtime issues
- **Heuristic-Based** - Some false positives possible
- **Language Coverage** - Best for JS/TS/Python/Rust
- **No Business Logic** - Can't evaluate correctness
- **Context Unaware** - Doesn't understand project-specific conventions

## Getting Help

**For specific issues:**
- Complexity problems → See complexity thresholds above
- Code smells → See [code-smells.md](references/code-smells.md)
- General quality → See [review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md)

**After review:**
1. Address high-severity issues
2. Refactor complex functions
3. Remove code smells
4. Re-run review to verify

## Example Output

```
# Code Review Report

## Executive Summary
- Total Functions Analyzed: 127
- Code Smells Detected: 23
  - High Severity: 3
  - Medium Severity: 15
  - Low Severity: 5

## Complexity Analysis
- Average Complexity: 4.2
- Maximum Complexity: 18
- Functions Needing Attention: 8

## Recommendations
- Refactor 3 highly complex functions
- Address 3 high-severity code smells
- Extract duplicated code in 5 locations
```
