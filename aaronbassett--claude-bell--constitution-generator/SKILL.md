# Constitution Generator

Generate input for `/speckit.constitution` by discovering project characteristics and recommending matched principles.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Discovery

Ask questions to understand the project. Group related questions; don't overwhelm with all at once.

**Round 1 - Project Nature:**
- Is this a hackathon/prototype, internal tool, commercial product, or open-source project?
- What's the expected lifespan? (days/weeks, months, years, indefinite)
- Solo developer or team? If team, how many contributors?

**Round 2 - Technical Profile:**
- What's the architecture style? (monolith, modular, distributed/microservices, CLI tool, library/SDK)
- What's the primary tech stack? (language, frameworks)
- Will this system be public-facing, internal, or both?

**Round 3 - Risk & Operations:**
- How critical is uptime? (best-effort, business hours, 99%+, mission-critical)
- Are there security/regulatory constraints? (financial, healthcare, PII, none specific)
- What's your expected release cadence? (continuous, weekly, monthly, infrequent)

**Round 4 - Quality Expectations:**
- How important is test coverage? (manual testing fine, critical paths only, comprehensive)
- Do you need audit trails or data replay? (yes/no)
- What's more important right now: shipping fast or building for longevity?

### Phase 2: Principle Selection

Based on discovery, select principles from the catalog below. Only suggest what matches the project profile.

**Selection Rules:**

| Project Characteristic | Suggested Principles |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Hackathon/prototype | MVP Speed, Demo-First, Skip Tests, Good Enough Architecture |
| Solo personal tool | Ship Fast Fix What Hurts, Build for Joy, Dogfood Relentlessly |
| Team project | Single Responsibility, Conventional Commits, Code Review Required |
| Long-lived system | Modularity, Documentation Standards, Semantic Versioning |
| High uptime (99%+) | Fail Fast & Loud, Graceful Degradation, Observability First |
| Public/multi-tenant | Zero Trust, Least Privilege, Input Validation Required |
| Financial/regulated | Security by Default, Audit Trails, No Silent Failures |
| CLI tool | Unix Philosophy, Text I/O Protocol, Predictable Exit Codes |
| Distributed system | CAP Awareness, Idempotency, Circuit Breaking |
| Complex domain | Domain-Driven Design (selective), Clear Naming |
| Fast iteration needed | YAGNI, KISS, Refactor When It Hurts |

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Don't suggest TDD for hackathons
- Don't suggest Event Sourcing unless audit/replay is explicitly needed
- Don't suggest DDD for simple CRUD apps
- Don't suggest SRE practices unless uptime ≥99.5% expected
- Don't suggest Zero Trust for single-user local tools

### Phase 3: Generate Constitution Input

Format output as markdown suitable for `/speckit.constitution` command input. Structure:

```markdown
## Preamble
[1-2 sentences describing project goal and philosophy]

## Core Principles

### I. [Principle Name]
**[One-line summary of the principle]**

- **Rule 1**: [Specific, actionable rule]
- **Rule 2**: [Specific, actionable rule]
- ...

**Rationale**: [Why this principle matters for this project]

### II. [Next Principle]
...

## Development Standards
[Only include sections relevant to the project]

### [Standard Category]
- [Specific standard]
- [Specific standard]

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
- Changes require documented rationale
- Version follows semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- MAJOR: Breaking principle changes
- MINOR: New principles/sections
- PATCH: Clarifications

### Compliance
- Constitution supersedes other practices
- Complexity requires explicit justification
```

## Principle Catalog

### Speed & Simplicity

**MVP Speed**: Ship smallest working version fast. Cut features aggressively. Skip premature optimization. Refactor when it hurts, not before.

**Ship Fast, Fix What Hurts**: Build smallest useful thing, dogfood immediately, iterate on real pain. Ignore hypothetical requirements.

**KISS**: Do simplest thing that works. If you can't explain it in one sentence, it's too complex.

**YAGNI**: No speculative features. Build when needed, not "just in case."

**Good Enough Architecture**: Use patterns you know. Boring and fast beats novel and slow.

**Make It Work, Then Make It Fast**: Correctness first. Measure before optimizing. "Fast enough" is good enough.

### Code Quality

**Single Responsibility**: Each component does one thing well. Don't blur lines between concerns.

**Modularity**: Well-defined boundaries. Explicit dependencies. No circular dependencies.

**Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefer composing simple parts over complex inheritance hierarchies.

**Encapsulate What Varies**: Isolate the parts that change from the parts that stay the same.

**Rule of Three**: Don't generalize until the third repetition.

### Testing

**Integration Tests First**: Test real workflows against real environments. Mocks are last resort.

**Test What Matters**: Focus on catching bugs, not coverage metrics. Test critical paths, skip trivialities.

**Tests Optional (Hackathon)**: Manual testing acceptable. Automated tests only if they save debugging time.

**Don't Test Your Mocks**: If tests pass but real integration fails, tests are useless.

### Error Handling

**Fail Fast & Loud**: Crash early with clear context. No silent failures.

**Fail Safe**: When failure happens, fail to a safe state.

**Human-Readable Errors**: "API connection failed: returned 503. Check network." Not "ECONNREFUSED".

**Actionable Feedback**: Every error suggests a fix or next step.

**Graceful Degradation**: If a service is down, say so clearly. Don't pretend everything is fine.

### Documentation

**README First**: Installation, setup, and basic usage must be documented.

**Comment the Why**: Not the what. Assume reader understands the language.

**Code as Documentation**: Clear naming > comments. Comments for non-obvious decisions only.

**Documentation as Code**: Keep docs next to code. Update together.

### Operations

**Observability First**: You can't fix what you can't see. Logs, metrics, traces.

**Infrastructure as Code**: If it's not in code, it doesn't exist.

**Automate What Hurts**: If it's repeated and painful, automate it.

**Runbooks Over Tribal Knowledge**: Write down how to fix things.

### Security

**Zero Trust**: Assume networks are hostile. Verify everything.

**Least Privilege**: Minimum access needed. No more.

**Secure by Default**: Opt into risk, not safety.

**Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection.

**Input Validation Required**: Validate at system boundaries. Use schemas (Zod, etc.).

**Never Log Secrets**: Private keys, tokens, passwords never in logs or output.

### Team & Process

**Conventional Commits**: `type(scope): subject` format for clear, searchable history.

**Trunk-Based Development**: Short-lived branches. Merge frequently.

**Code Review Required**: All changes reviewed before merge.

**Blameless Postmortems**: Learn from failures without blame.

**Strong Opinions, Weakly Held**: Commit to decisions but change when evidence warrants.

### Architecture Patterns

**Unix Philosophy**: Single purpose. Text I/O. Composable. Predictable exit codes.

**Hexagonal/Ports & Adapters**: Isolate business logic from I/O.

**Locality of Behavior**: Put things that change together, together.

**Stable Dependencies**: Depend on things less likely to change.

**API First Design**: Design the contract before implementation.

### Delivery

**Small Batches**: Ship small, ship often. Smaller changes = smaller risks.

**Done Means Deployed**: Code isn't done until it's running somewhere.

**Feature Flags Over Branches**: Deploy dark, enable incrementally.

**Continuous Delivery**: Always be in a deployable state.

### Product Focus

**Solve Real Problems**: Not imaginary ones. Follow demand, don't anticipate it.

**Defaults Are Product Decisions**: Make the right thing easy.

**Evidence Over Opinions**: Measure outcomes, not output.

**If It's Not Used, It Doesn't Exist**: Features require adoption to be "done".

### UX Principles

**Frictionless Setup**: One command to install, one to run.

**Speed Is a Feature**: Fast feedback loops. Progress for anything >500ms.

**Predictability Over Flashiness**: Do what users expect.

**Design for the Primary Use Case**: Not the edge cases.
