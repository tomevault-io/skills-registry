# GitHub CLI Workflows

## Purpose

Enable autonomous creation and execution of GitHub workflows using the official GitHub CLI (`gh`). This skill provides the knowledge and patterns needed to work with pull requests, issues, GitHub Actions, and the GitHub API through command-line operations.

## Core Philosophy

Work autonomously within user-specified boundaries, respecting the current Claude Code mode (accept edits vs plan mode). Design multi-step workflows tailored to specific needs, handle errors intelligently, and always verify context before executing repository operations.

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools

**GitHub CLI must be installed.** Check with:
```bash
gh --version
```

If not installed, guide the user to https://cli.github.com/ for installation instructions (brew, apt, etc.).

### Authentication Status

**Do not proactively check authentication**, but be prepared to recognize and diagnose authentication errors. When auth issues occur, guide the user to resolve them (see `references/troubleshooting.md`).

## The Golden Rule: Use `--help` First

**CRITICAL:** Every `gh` command and subcommand supports `--help` to display comprehensive usage information, including:
- Available flags and options
- Argument formats
- Detailed examples
- Exit codes
- Related commands

**When to use `--help`:**
- Before constructing any complex command
- When uncertain about flag syntax
- When encountering errors (verify command structure)
- To discover available subcommands
- To check for new features or options

**Examples:**
```bash
gh --help                    # List all commands
gh repo --help               # Repository commands
gh repo create --help        # Specific command details
gh pr create --help          # PR creation options
gh api --help                # API usage with examples
```

**Pattern:** `gh <command> <subcommand> --help` works at every level. Always check help before guessing command syntax.

## Repository Context

Before executing repo-specific commands, verify repository context:

```bash
gh repo view
```

This confirms:
- Current repository (owner/repo)
- Authentication works
- Proper permissions exist

**When context is unclear**, infer from the current directory unless explicitly specified otherwise. Use `-R owner/repo` flag to override when working across multiple repositories.

## Core Capabilities

### Pull Requests

Create, review, comment, merge, and manage pull requests programmatically.

**Common operations:**
- Create PR from current branch
- List open PRs with filters
- View PR details and checks
- Review and comment on PRs
- Merge PRs with various strategies
- Checkout PR branches locally

See `references/pr-workflows.md` for detailed patterns.

### Issues

Triage, label, comment, and manage issues systematically.

**Common operations:**
- List new/open issues
- Create issues with templates
- Add/remove labels
- Comment and discuss
- Close with resolution notes
- Link to PRs

See `references/issue-workflows.md` for detailed patterns.

### GitHub Actions

Monitor workflow runs, analyze failures, view logs, and trigger reruns.

**Common operations:**
- List workflow runs
- Check run status and conclusion
- Download and analyze logs
- Rerun failed workflows
- Cancel running workflows
- View workflow definitions

See `references/actions-workflows.md` for detailed patterns.

### GitHub API

Execute custom operations not covered by core commands using `gh api`.

**Common operations:**
- GraphQL queries for complex data
- REST API operations
- Pagination handling with `--paginate`
- JSON output parsing with `--jq`
- Custom integrations

See `references/api-usage.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Working with JSON Output

Many `gh` commands support `--json` for structured output and `--jq` for filtering.

**When to use JSON:**
- Parse results programmatically
- Extract specific fields
- Process multiple items
- Make decisions based on output

**When to use human-readable:**
- Show output directly to user
- Initial exploration
- Debugging

**Pattern:** Fetch with JSON, format for humans in responses:

```bash
# Get structured data
gh pr list --json number,title,author,state

# Extract specific fields
gh pr view 123 --json title,body --jq '.title'

# Process and format for user display
```

Always show users formatted, readable output in responses, even when working with JSON internally.

## Destructive Operations

**Always ask user confirmation** before executing operations that:
- Close issues or PRs
- Delete branches
- Merge pull requests
- Archive repositories
- Modify labels or milestones permanently

**Offer dry-run option when available:**
```
I can perform a dry-run first to show what would happen. Would you like me to:
1. Execute the operation now
2. Perform a dry-run and report the outcome
3. Show you the exact command to review first
```

Use `--dry-run` flags where supported (check `--help` for availability).

## Error Handling Workflow

When a `gh` command fails, follow this sequence:

### 1. Review Command Output
Most errors have clear, actionable messages. Read the error carefully:
- Authentication required
- Permission denied
- Resource not found
- Invalid arguments
- Rate limit exceeded

### 2. Search Troubleshooting Documentation
Use grep/search tools to find relevant information in `references/troubleshooting.md`:
```bash
# Search for specific error patterns
grep -i "authentication" references/troubleshooting.md
```

Avoid reading the entire troubleshooting file unless necessary.

### 3. Verify Command with `--help`
Check that command syntax matches the help documentation:
```bash
gh <command> <subcommand> --help
```

Common issues:
- Wrong flag names
- Missing required arguments
- Incorrect argument order
- Flag used with wrong command

### 4. Report to User
If the error persists after these steps, report detailed diagnostics:
- Exact command executed
- Complete error output
- Steps already attempted
- Relevant troubleshooting findings
- Suggested next actions

Ask for user guidance on how to proceed.

## Autonomy and User Boundaries

### Respect Current Mode

**In accept-edits mode:**
- Make changes directly
- Execute commands autonomously
- Commit and push as needed

**In plan mode:**
- Create detailed implementation plans
- Get user approval before execution
- Document each planned step

### User-Specified Boundaries

Honor any constraints the user provides:
- Repository limits
- Branch protections
- Label conventions
- Review requirements
- Approval workflows

### Workflow-Specific Autonomy

**Fix Failing CI/CD:**
View run → Download logs → Analyze errors → Suggest fixes → Implement → Push → (Rerun only if workflow won't auto-trigger)

**Triage Issues:**
Execute based on user-specified parameters (which labels to apply, what comments to add, etc.)

**Implement PR Feedback:**
Read comments → Make changes → Commit → Push (respecting current mode)

**Create Pull Requests:**
Verify branch → Push if needed → Create PR with description → Link issues (respecting current mode)

Be as autonomous as possible within established boundaries.

## Common Patterns

For frequently-used patterns and workflows, see `references/common-patterns.md`:
- Authentication checks and recovery
- Multi-repository operations
- Batch processing issues/PRs
- CI/CD integration patterns
- Error recovery strategies
- Working with draft PRs
- Managing labels and milestones
- Using PR templates

## Command Discovery

Discover available commands at any level:

```bash
gh --help                    # All core commands
gh pr --help                 # PR subcommands
gh issue --help              # Issue subcommands
gh run --help                # Actions run commands
gh workflow --help           # Workflow commands
gh api --help                # API usage (extensive examples)
```

Each help page includes:
- Command descriptions
- Available subcommands
- Flags and options
- Usage examples
- Related commands

## Output Visibility

**Always show commands before execution** so users understand what's running:

```
Checking repository context with:
$ gh repo view

Creating pull request with:
$ gh pr create --title "feat: Add user authentication" --body "..." --base main
```

This transparency helps users:
- Understand the workflow
- Learn `gh` commands
- Verify correctness
- Reproduce manually if needed

6. **Show commands** before execution for transparency
7. **Format output** for human readability in responses
8. **Be autonomous** within user-specified boundaries
9. **Use JSON/jq** for programmatic processing
10. **Reference detailed docs** in references/ as needed
