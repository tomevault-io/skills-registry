# Aaron's PR Review Workflow

## Setup

Before starting the review, perform these setup steps:

1. **Clean up previous reviews**: Delete any existing `pr-*.md` files in the current directory:
   ```bash
   rm -f pr-*.md
   ```

2. **Ensure latest commits**: To guarantee you're reviewing the latest code, use `gh pr checkout` which correctly handles fork remotes (unlike `git fetch origin` which only fetches from the upstream repo):
   ```bash
   # Stash any uncommitted changes
   git stash push -m "aaron-pr-review: auto-stash before branch refresh"

   # Delete any stale local branch, then checkout fresh from GitHub
   PR_BRANCH=$(gh pr view <number> --json headRefName -q .headRefName)
   git checkout main
   git branch -D "$PR_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true
   gh pr checkout <number> --force

   # Restore stashed changes
   git stash pop 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

3. **Verify you have the latest commit**: Compare your local HEAD against what GitHub reports. If these don't match, stop and investigate before reviewing.
   ```bash
   LOCAL_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
   REMOTE_SHA=$(gh pr view <number> --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)
   if [ "$LOCAL_SHA" != "$REMOTE_SHA" ]; then
     echo "ERROR: Local HEAD ($LOCAL_SHA) does not match PR head ($REMOTE_SHA)"
     echo "Do NOT proceed with the review until this is resolved."
   else
     echo "OK: Reviewing commit $LOCAL_SHA"
   fi
   ```

## Pre-Review Analysis

Before reviewing code changes, **always check existing PR comments first**:

1. Use `gh pr view <number> --comments` to scan for prior feedback from aaronbrethorst
2. If prior feedback exists:
   - Identify which items the author has addressed
   - Check if author provided clarifications for items they chose not to address
   - Focus your review on new/unaddressed changes
   - Treat author explanations with courtesy—they likely have good reasons

## Code Review Process

1. Fetch PR details: `gh pr view <number> --json title,body,author,files,additions,deletions`
2. Get the diff: `gh pr diff <number>`
3. Read changed files to understand context
4. Run tests if applicable: `make test` or equivalent
5. Check lint/format: `make lint` or equivalent
6. Identify file types to determine which agents apply

## Agent Applicability Assessment

**MANDATORY**: Before launching agents, assess each one's applicability to this PR. Assign confidence scores (0-100) and use agents scoring **≥ 80**.

Output format:
```
## Agent Applicability Assessment

| Agent | Confidence | Rationale | Use? |
|-------|------------|-----------|------|
| code-reviewer | [0-100] | [Brief reason] | [Yes/No] |
| silent-failure-hunter | [0-100] | [Brief reason] | [Yes/No] |
| pr-test-analyzer | [0-100] | [Brief reason] | [Yes/No] |
| comment-analyzer | [0-100] | [Brief reason] | [Yes/No] |
| type-design-analyzer | [0-100] | [Brief reason] | [Yes/No] |
| code-simplifier | [0-100] | [Brief reason] | [Yes/No] |
```

For detailed scoring guidelines and examples, see [applicability.md](applicability.md).

## Launch Review Agents

After assessment, launch all agents marked "Yes" via the Task tool.

**Sequential**: One agent at a time—easier to understand, good for interactive review.

**Parallel**: Launch all simultaneously—faster for comprehensive review (user can request with `parallel`).

For agent descriptions and invocation details, see [agents.md](agents.md).

## Aggregate Results

After agents complete, summarize findings as a Markdown file with the following elements

**IMPORTANT**: Never include agent names (e.g., `[code-reviewer]`, `[silent-failure-hunter]`) in the review output. The review must read as if written entirely by aaronbrethorst—agent names are internal implementation details.

```markdown
## Critical Issues (X found)
- Issue description [file:line]

## Important Issues (X found)
- Issue description [file:line]

## Suggestions (X found)
- Suggestion [file:line]

## Strengths
- What's well-done in this PR

## Recommended Action
1. Fix critical issues first
2. Address important issues
3. Consider suggestions
4. Re-run review after fixes
```

## Review Output

When finished, provide:

1. **Verbal verdict**: Tell the user "merge" or "request changes"—there is NO middle ground like "merge after this change"
2. **Written review**: Create `pr-{id}.md` in the current directory

**Verdict rules:**
- **Merge**: The PR is ready to merge as-is. If there are minor issues that don't need to be resolved in the scope of this PR, you MUST create a GitHub issue (via `gh issue create`) tracking the remaining fixes before giving a Merge verdict. Reference the new issue in the review document.
- **Request Changes**: The PR has issues that must be resolved before merging.

For review document templates (first-time, subsequent, ready-to-merge), see [templates.md](templates.md).

## Post-Review

After writing the review document, ask: "Would you like me to copy the markdown to your clipboard?"

When user confirms, run:
```bash
cat pr-{id}.md | pbcopy
```

## Style Guidelines

- **Tone**: Kind but firm. Be encouraging while being clear about requirements.
- **Uniqueness**: Put a unique spin on the greeting/compliment for each PR—avoid robotic repetition.
- **Specificity**: Reference actual code, file names, and line numbers where relevant.
- **Author's name**: Use their first name from the PR author info.
- **Never mention PR count**: Do not reference how many PRs the author has made. Never say "first PR", "welcome as a new contributor", "your Nth contribution", or anything similar. Focus on the code, not the author's contribution history.
