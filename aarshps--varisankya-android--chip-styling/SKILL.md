# High-Contrast Chip Styling (M3E Expressive)

This skill documents the M3E Expressive standard for chips in Varisankya.

## Design Spec

| State | Background | Text | Shape | Stroke |
|-------|-----------|------|-------|--------|
| **Selected** | `colorPrimary` | `colorOnPrimary` | **20dp** Rounded Rect | `0dp` |
| **Unselected** | `colorSurfaceContainerHigh` | `colorOnSurface` | **Pill** (100dp) | `0.8dp` (`colorTertiary`) |

## Reasoning: Expressive Shapes

In M3E, selected states are more pronounced. We move away from the standard 8-12dp radius to a **20dp** corner for selected chips. This creates a more distinct "morphed" feeling when toggling.

## Implementation: ChipHelper.styleChip(chip)

Standardized logic for programmatic chips:

```kotlin
fun styleChip(chip: Chip) {
    // ... styling logic ...

    // M3E Expressive: Tactile Spring
    AnimationHelper.applySpringOnTouch(chip)
}
```

## Expressive Motion
All chips MUST include `AnimationHelper.applySpringOnTouch()`. This provides a "morphed" squish effect when toggling, making the selection feel physical.

## Rule of Thumb

Never use sharp corners (< 12dp) for interactive chips. They must feel fluid and touchable.
