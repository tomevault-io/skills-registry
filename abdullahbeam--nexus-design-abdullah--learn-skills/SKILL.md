## 🎯 AI Proactive Triggering (ONBOARDING SKILL)

**This is an ONBOARDING skill with HIGH PRIORITY for proactive suggestion.**

### When to Proactively Suggest (AI MUST check user-config.yaml)

Check `learning_tracker.completed.learn_skills` in user-config.yaml. If `false`:

**PROACTIVELY SUGGEST when user:**
1. Says "create skill" for the FIRST TIME (suggest learning before creating)
2. Describes repeating work patterns ("every week I...", "I always have to...")
3. Asks about automating workflows or creating templates
4. Expresses confusion about what makes something a "skill"
5. Creates multiple similar things (report-jan, report-feb anti-pattern)
6. At the END of learn-projects (natural progression)
7. When user completes a workflow that could be skill-worthy

**Suggestion Pattern:**
```
💡 I notice you're describing repeating work. Before creating a skill, would you
like a 10-minute tutorial on what makes workflows "skill-worthy"? It covers:
- The 3-criteria skill-worthiness framework
- How skills are structured
- How AI triggers skills automatically

Say 'learn skills' to start, or continue with your current task.
```

**Anti-Pattern Detection:**
```
If user creates: report-jan, report-feb, report-mar...
→ "I notice you're creating similar items. This is a perfect use case for
   a SKILL instead of multiple projects. Want to 'learn skills' to understand
   how to capture this as a reusable workflow?"
```

**DO NOT suggest if:**
- `learning_tracker.completed.learn_skills: true`
- User explicitly says "skip" or "just create the skill"
- User has already created skills successfully

---

# Learn Skills

Teach how to identify skill-worthy workflows and create effective skills.

## Purpose

Help user understand what makes something skill-worthy, how skills are structured, and how skill triggering works. Includes hands-on practice identifying their own workflows.

**Time Estimate**: 10-12 minutes

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Concrete Examples

```
✅ SKILLS (repeating workflows):
- Weekly status report (same format weekly)
- Qualify sales lead (same questions each time)
- Process expense reports (same steps)

❌ NOT SKILLS (one-time):
- Research competitor Acme (one-time)
- Build Q1 marketing plan (one-time)

Key question: Will I do this AGAIN?
```

---

### Step 2: Skill-Worthiness Framework

```
Three questions:

1. FREQUENCY: 2+ times per month?
   YES → keep evaluating

2. REPEATABILITY: Steps mostly the same?
   YES → keep evaluating

3. VALUE: Saves >5 minutes per execution?
   YES → Create a skill!

ALL 3 YES = Skill-worthy
ANY NO = Just do it manually
```

---

### Step 3: Skill Structure

```
📁 weekly-status-report/
├── SKILL.md       # Instructions + triggers
├── references/    # Documentation (optional)
├── scripts/       # Automation (optional)
└── assets/        # Templates (optional)
```

---

### Step 4: How Triggering Works

```
AI checks your message against ALL skill descriptions.
Match found = skill loads.

Example description:
"Load when user says 'status report', 'weekly update',
 'progress summary'"

ANY of these triggers it:
• "Generate my status report"
• "Weekly update please"
• "Progress summary"
```

---

### Step 5: Practice

**Ask**: "What did you do last week that you'll probably do again?"

For each: apply 3-criteria framework, brainstorm trigger phrases.

---

### Step 6: How to Create

```
To create a skill, say:
• "create skill for [workflow]"
• "new skill: [name]"

YOUR skills go in 03-skills/ (prioritized!)
SYSTEM skills in 00-system/skills/
```

---

### Step 7: Finalize

**Actions** (MUST complete all):

1. **Mark skill complete** in user-config.yaml:
   ```yaml
   learning_tracker:
     completed:
       learn_skills: true  # ADD THIS LINE
   ```

2. **Display completion**:
   ```
   ✅ Learn Skills Complete!

   You now understand:
   • Skills = reusable workflows (do AGAIN → skill)
   • 3-criteria framework (Frequency + Repeatability + Value)
   • Skill structure (SKILL.md + optional references/scripts)
   • Trigger mechanism (keywords in description)

   Next steps:
   • 'create skill' - Create your first skill
   • 'learn projects' - Learn about temporal work
   • 'learn nexus' - System mastery
   ```

3. **Prompt close-session**:
   ```
   💡 When you're done working, say "done" to save progress.
   ```
