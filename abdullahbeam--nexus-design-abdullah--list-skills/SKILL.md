# List Skills

Display all available skills organized by category with descriptions.

## Purpose

Help users discover available skills in Nexus. Shows both system skills (built-in) and user skills (custom) organized by category.

**Time Estimate**: Instant

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Run Skill Scanner

```bash
python 00-system/core/nexus-loader.py --list-skills
```

Parse the JSON output to get all skills with their names and descriptions.

---

### Step 2: Organize by Category

Group skills by their folder location:

| Category | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Learning** | `00-system/skills/learning/` | Onboarding and tutorials |
| **Projects** | `00-system/skills/projects/` | Project management |
| **Skill Dev** | `00-system/skills/skill-dev/` | Skill creation and sharing |
| **System** | `00-system/skills/system/` | System utilities |
| **Tools** | `00-system/skills/tools/` | Productivity tools |
| **Integrations** | `00-system/skills/notion/`, `airtable/`, `beam/` | External tool connections |
| **User Skills** | `03-skills/` | Your custom skills |
