# Agent Interoperability (A2A)

## Goal
Transform isolated, specialized agents into an interoperable ecosystem where any agent can leverage another's capabilities to achieve complex, high-level goals.

## The MCP vs. A2A Distinction
Standardization is built on two complementary protocols operating at different levels of abstraction:
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Use for simple, stateless functions and primitives like a calculator or database query ("Do this specific thing").
* **A2A (Agent2Agent Protocol):** Use for delegating complex, stateful goals that require reasoning and multi-turn planning ("Achieve this complex goal").

## Core Implementation Components

### 1. The Agent Card (The Business Card)
Agents identify themselves using a standardized JSON specification called an Agent Card. It must describe:
* **Capabilities:** What the agent can actually do.
* **Security Requirements:** Necessary authentication (e.g., OAuth2).
* **Skills:** Specific descriptions and tags (e.g., "mathematical", "prime checking").
* **Endpoint (URL):** How other agents can reach it.

### 2. Distributed Tracing
Enabling autonomous collaboration requires distributed tracing where every request carries a unique trace ID. This is non-negotiable for debugging and maintaining a coherent audit trail across multiple, opaque systems.

### 3. State Management
A2A interactions are inherently stateful. You must implement a sophisticated persistence layer to track progress across multi-agent turns and ensure transactional integrity.

## Interoperability Best Practices
* **Hierarchical Composition:** Configure a "Root" agent to orchestrate both lightweight local sub-agents and specialized remote agents via A2A.
* **Standardize Early:** Build new agents with native support for both MCP and A2A to ensure every component is immediately discoverable and reusable.
* **Registry Usage:** As scale increases, use an Agent Registry to catalog Agent Cards, reducing redundant work and fostering cross-team reuse.
