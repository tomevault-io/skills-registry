# MCP Fundamentals

## Goal
Understand the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture to solve the "$N \times M$" integration problem, decoupling AI models from the specific implementation details of external tools.

## Core Architectural Components

### 1. The Host (The Application)
* **Definition:** The container application (e.g., a desktop app, IDE, or agent platform) that manages the user experience and orchestrates tool usage.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Creating and managing MCP clients.
    * Enforcing security policies and content guardrails.
    * Managing the user interaction lifecycle.

### 2. The Client (The Connector)
* **Definition:** A software component embedded within the Host that maintains a 1:1 connection with a specific Server.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Issuing commands to the server.
    * Receiving and processing responses or notifications.
    * Managing the session lifecycle.

### 3. The Server (The Provider)
* **Definition:** A standalone program that exposes capabilities (Tools, Resources, Prompts) to the AI application.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * **Tool Discovery:** Advertising what tools are available.
    * **Execution:** Receiving commands and running the actual logic/API calls.
    * **Formatting:** Returning standardized results to the client.

## The Communication Layer

### Protocol: JSON-RPC 2.0
All communication is text-based and language-agnostic, relying on four standard message types:
1.  **Requests:** Calls expecting a response (e.g., `tools/call`).
2.  **Results:** Successful responses containing data.
3.  **Errors:** Failure messages with codes and descriptions.
4.  **Notifications:** One-way messages requiring no response (e.g., logging).

### Transport Mechanisms
* **stdio (Standard Input/Output):**
    * **Use Case:** Local, private tools.
    * **Mechanism:** The Host spawns the Server as a subprocess and communicates via standard I/O pipes. Best for accessing local files or scripts.
* **Streamable HTTP (SSE):**
    * **Use Case:** Remote or distributed tools.
    * **Mechanism:** Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses, allowing connections to remote services over standard HTTP.
