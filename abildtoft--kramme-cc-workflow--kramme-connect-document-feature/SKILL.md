# Connect Existing Feature Documentation Writer

## Instructions

**When to use this skill:**

- You're working in the Connect monorepo
- You need to create comprehensive documentation for a feature
- Documentation should serve both product teams (non-technical) and development teams (technical)
- You're creating feature documentation for an existing feature or updating existing docs

**Triggers:**

- "Document the [feature] feature"
- "Create documentation for [feature]"
- "I need docs for [feature] that work for both product and dev teams"

**Context:** Connect requires comprehensive documentation that serves multiple audiences. Product teams need high-level overviews and user flows, while development teams need architecture details, API references, and technical implementation guidance. This skill produces layered documentation with appropriate depth for each audience.

## Guideline Keywords

- **ALWAYS** — Mandatory requirement, exceptions are very rare and must be explicitly approved
- **NEVER** — Strong prohibition, exceptions are very rare and must be explicitly approved
- **PREFER** — Strong recommendation, exceptions allowed with justification
- **CAN** — Optional, developer's discretion
- **NOTE** — Context, rationale, or clarification
- **EXAMPLE** — Illustrative example

Strictness hierarchy: ALWAYS/NEVER > PREFER > CAN > NOTE/EXAMPLE

### Documentation Process

#### Phase 1: Discovery & Planning

##### Search for Context

- **ALWAYS** search for related documentation patterns used in the project before starting
- **ALWAYS** review existing documentation structure for consistency

##### Clarifying Questions

- **ALWAYS** ask clarifying questions using `AskUserQuestion`:
  - Where should the documentation be stored? (in-repo, wiki, multiple locations)
  - What format? (single doc, multiple docs, layered approach)
  - What aspects are most important? (user flows, architecture, API, features)
  - Should visual aids be included? (diagrams, Mermaid, text-only)

##### Explore the Feature

- **ALWAYS** use the Task tool with `subagent_type=Explore` to explore the feature
- **ALWAYS** set thoroughness to "very thorough" for documentation tasks
- **ALWAYS** request comprehensive coverage of:
  - Backend entities and database models
  - API endpoints and controllers
  - Frontend libraries and components
  - State management patterns
  - Key workflows and integrations

---

#### Phase 2: Documentation Structure

---

#### Phase 4: Cross-Referencing

- **ALWAYS** ensure every document links to related documents
- **ALWAYS** add a "Related Documentation" section at the bottom of each document

**Cross-reference matrix:**

- Overview → Architecture, User Flows, Glossary
- Architecture → Overview, User Flows, API Reference
- User Flows → Overview, Architecture, API Reference
- API Reference → Architecture, Glossary
- Glossary → All other docs

---

#### Phase 5: Quality Checks

**ALWAYS** complete these checks before considering documentation complete:

- [ ] All user workflows covered
- [ ] All key terms defined in glossary

##### Audience Appropriateness

- [ ] Overview readable by non-technical users
- [ ] Technical docs provide sufficient detail
- [ ] Diagrams enhance understanding
- [ ] Examples are practical and realistic

##### Navigation

- [ ] Cross-references work correctly
- [ ] Table of contents in long documents
- [ ] Consistent heading hierarchy

##### Visual Quality

- [ ] Mermaid diagrams render correctly
- [ ] Diagrams are appropriately sized
- [ ] Code blocks have proper syntax highlighting
- [ ] Tables are well-formatted

##### Final Checklist

- [ ] Check that dates are correct (be mindful of not using knowledge cut-off dates instead of actual dates)

### Mermaid Diagram Types

#### System Architecture

- **ALWAYS** use `graph TB` (top-bottom) or `graph LR` (left-right)
- **ALWAYS** use subgraphs to organize components
- **PREFER** using descriptive node labels

**EXAMPLE:**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Frontend"
        UI[Component]
    end
    subgraph "Backend"
        API[Controller]
    end
    subgraph "Data"
        DB[(Database)]
    end
    UI --> API --> DB
```

#### Entity Relationship

- **ALWAYS** use `erDiagram`
- **ALWAYS** show relationships with cardinality
- **ALWAYS** include key fields

**EXAMPLE:**

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ENTITY_A ||--o{ ENTITY_B : contains
    ENTITY_A {
        uuid id PK
        string name
    }
```

#### Sequence Diagram

- **ALWAYS** use `sequenceDiagram`
- **ALWAYS** include all key participants
- **ALWAYS** show request-response patterns
- **PREFER** using actors for users

**EXAMPLE:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Frontend
    participant API
    User->>Frontend: Action
    Frontend->>API: Request
    API-->>Frontend: Response
    Frontend-->>User: Result
```

#### State Diagram

- **ALWAYS** use `stateDiagram-v2`
- **ALWAYS** show all state transitions
- **ALWAYS** label transitions with events

**EXAMPLE:**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> StateA
    StateA --> StateB: Event
    StateB --> [*]
```

### File Naming Convention

- **ALWAYS** use consistent file naming:
  - `README.md` - Navigation hub
  - `{feature}-overview.md` - High-level capabilities
  - `{feature}-architecture.md` - Technical deep-dive
  - `{feature}-user-flows.md` - User journeys
  - `{feature}-api-reference.md` - API documentation
  - `{feature}-glossary.md` - Terminology

---

### Tips for Success

#### Using the Explore Agent

- **ALWAYS** be specific about what you need to find
- **ALWAYS** request "very thorough" exploration for documentation
- **ALWAYS** ask for file locations and key functionality
- **ALWAYS** search both frontend and backend

#### Creating Diagrams

- **ALWAYS** start with a simple diagram
- **ALWAYS** add detail as understanding improves
- **ALWAYS** keep diagrams focused on one aspect
- **ALWAYS** use subgraphs to organize complex systems

#### Balancing Detail and Clarity

- **ALWAYS** keep overview high-level with minimal jargon
- **ALWAYS** make architecture technical but organized
- **ALWAYS** make API documentation complete and precise
- **ALWAYS** make glossary definitions clear with context

#### Writing for the Reader

- **ALWAYS** explain acronyms on first use
- **ALWAYS** provide context before diving into details
- **ALWAYS** use consistent terminology throughout
- **ALWAYS** add examples to illustrate concepts

#### Keeping it Maintainable

- **ALWAYS** store docs in version control
- **ALWAYS** use relative links within docs
- **ALWAYS** make diagrams from text (Mermaid) not images
- **ALWAYS** document the "why" not just the "what"
- **NEVER** reference specific code line numbers as these might change

---

### Expected Output

#### Structure

**EXAMPLE:**

```text
/docs/{feature}/
├── README.md                    # Navigation hub
├── {feature}-overview.md        # High-level
├── {feature}-architecture.md    # Technical
├── {feature}-user-flows.md      # Workflows
├── {feature}-api-reference.md   # API docs
└── {feature}-glossary.md        # Terms

```

- **NEVER** list the line counts of each file, as these will get outdated quickly

#### Scale

- **NOTE**: Comprehensive documentation typically produces 3000+ lines total
- **NOTE**: Expect 6-8 Mermaid diagrams across all documents
- **NOTE**: Plan for 1-2 hours of work for a complex feature
- **NOTE**: Documentation should be living - update as features evolve

---

### Additional Best Practices from AGENTS.md

- **ALWAYS** check AGENTS.md for the latest definite best practices

#### Frontend Documentation

- **ALWAYS** reference library naming conventions from AGENTS.md
- **ALWAYS** document ComponentStore patterns for state management
- **ALWAYS** document Angular component patterns (OnPush, standalone, inject)

#### Backend Documentation

- **ALWAYS** document Entity Framework migrations if applicable
- **ALWAYS** document Hangfire background jobs if applicable
- **ALWAYS** document API endpoint patterns and conventions

#### GitLab Workflow

- **NOTE**: Connect uses GitLab, not GitHub
- **ALWAYS** reference GitLab CI/CD patterns if documenting deployment
- **ALWAYS** use Pull Request (PR) terminology, not Merge Request (MR)

---

### Reference Files

**ALWAYS** check these locations for existing documentation patterns:

- `AGENTS.md` - Development guidelines and best practices
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI-specific instructions
- Existing feature documentation in the repository
