# Adding to AGENTS.md

AGENTS.md is the canonical agent-facing documentation. Each rule should be minimal, but many rules are OK.

## Before Writing

Discover local skills to reference:

```bash
find .claude/skills -name "SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null
ls plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null
```

Read each skill's frontmatter to understand when to reference it.

## Guideline Keywords

Use these keywords to indicate requirement strength:

- **ALWAYS** — Mandatory requirement
- **NEVER** — Strong prohibition
- **PREFER** — Strong recommendation, exceptions allowed
- **CAN** — Optional, developer's discretion
- **NOTE** — Context or clarification
- **EXAMPLE** — Illustrative example

Strictness hierarchy: ALWAYS/NEVER > PREFER > CAN > NOTE/EXAMPLE

## Writing Rules

- **Existing sections first** - Only propose new sections if no appropriate existing section exists
- **One rule per bullet** - Keep each guideline minimal and atomic
- **Start with keyword** - Every rule begins with ALWAYS/NEVER/PREFER/CAN/NOTE
- **Headers + bullets** - No paragraphs
- **Code blocks** - For commands and templates
- **Reference, don't duplicate** - Point to skills: "See `.claude/skills/db-migrate/SKILL.md`"
- **No filler** - No intros, conclusions, or pleasantries

## Common Sections

Add sections as needed for the project:

### When Stuck
```markdown
## When Stuck
- **ALWAYS** ask a clarifying question or propose alternatives
- **NEVER** initiate large speculative changes without confirmation
```

### Git Commits
```markdown
## Git Commits
- **ALWAYS** write succinct commit messages in imperative mood
- **ALWAYS** keep the first line short
- **NEVER** mention that you are an AI
```

### Issue Management
```markdown
## Linear Issues
- **NEVER** change issue status without explicit instruction
- **NEVER** create issues without explicit instruction
```

### Package Manager
```markdown
## Package Manager
Use **pnpm**: `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm test`
```

### Local Skills
Reference each discovered skill:
```markdown
## Database
Use `db-migrate` skill. See `.claude/skills/db-migrate/SKILL.md`
```

### Domain-Specific Sections
Add sections for each tech stack (Frontend, Backend, etc.) with domain-specific guidelines.

## Anti-Patterns

Omit these:
- "Welcome to..." or "This document explains..."
- Obvious instructions ("run tests", "write clean code")
- Explanations of why (just say what)
- Long prose paragraphs
- Content duplicated from skills (reference instead)
