# Implement Linear Issue

Start implementing a Linear issue through an extensive planning phase before any code changes.

**IMPORTANT:** Linear issues are typically written for product teams and may be light on technical implementation details. This command emphasizes thorough planning and codebase exploration to translate product requirements into a concrete technical approach before starting implementation.

## Process Overview

```
/kramme:linear:issue-implement ABC-123
    |
    v
[Validate & Fetch Issue] -> Not found? -> Show error, abort
    |
    v
[Branch Setup] -> IMMEDIATELY create/switch to Linear's branchName
    |
    v
[Parse Requirements] -> Extract acceptance criteria from description
    |
    v
=============== PLANNING PHASE (extensive) ===============
    |
    v
[Codebase Exploration] -> ALWAYS search for patterns/implementations
    |
    v
[Technical Analysis] -> Map product requirements to technical approach
    |
    v
[Upfront Questions] -> Clarify ambiguities before proceeding
    |
    v
[Create Technical Plan] -> Document approach, files, patterns to follow
    |
    v
=================== EXECUTION PHASE ===================
    |
    v
[Approach Selection] -> AskUserQuestion with 3 options
    |
    v
[Execute Workflow] -> Guided / Context-only / Autonomous
```

## Step 1: Parse Arguments and Fetch Issue

### 1.1 Extract Issue ID from Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` contains the issue ID provided by the user.

**Validation:**

- Pattern: `{TEAM}-{number}` where TEAM is any alphanumeric prefix
- Case-insensitive (convert to uppercase for display)
- Examples: `wan-123` -> `WAN-123`, `abc-456` -> `ABC-456`

**If no argument provided or invalid format:**

```
Error: Please provide a Linear issue ID.

Usage: /kramme:linear:issue-implement <ISSUE-ID>
Example: /kramme:linear:issue-implement ABC-123

The issue ID should be in the format TEAM-NUMBER (e.g., WAN-521, HEA-456).
```

**Action:** Abort.

### 1.2 Fetch Issue Details

**ALWAYS** use the Linear MCP tool to fetch complete issue details:

```
mcp__linear__get_issue with id: {ISSUE_ID}
```

**Capture from issue response:**

- `id` - Linear issue UUID (for API calls)
- `identifier` - Human-readable ID (e.g., WAN-123)
- `title` - Issue title
- `description` - Full issue description (markdown)
- `state` - Current state (Backlog, In Progress, etc.)
- `labels` - Associated labels
- `branchName` - **CRITICAL**: Linear's recommended branch name
- `url` - Link to issue in Linear
- `project` - Associated project
- `priority` - Issue priority

### 1.3 Fetch Issue Comments

**ALWAYS** fetch comments for additional context:

```
mcp__linear__list_comments with issueId: {ISSUE_ID}
```

Comments often contain:

- Clarifications from product/design
- Technical discussions
- Updated requirements
- Scope changes

### 1.4 Handle Missing Issue

**If issue not found:**

```
Error: Linear issue {ISSUE_ID} not found.

Please verify:
  - The issue ID is correct (format: TEAM-123)
  - You have access to the issue's team
  - The issue exists in Linear

Try again with /kramme:linear:issue-implement <correct-issue-id>
```

**Action:** Abort.

---

## Step 2: Branch Setup (MANDATORY - DO IMMEDIATELY)

**CRITICAL:** This step MUST be completed before any other actions. Do NOT proceed to issue parsing, planning, or any other step until you are on the correct branch.

### 2.1 Extract Branch Name from Linear

The `mcp__linear__get_issue` response includes a `branchName` field - this is Linear's recommended branch name.

**Priority:**
1. **FIRST**: Use `branchName` from Linear if present and non-empty
2. **FALLBACK ONLY**: If `branchName` is empty/missing, generate one using pattern: `{user-initials}/{ISSUE_ID}-{sanitized-title}`

**If generating fallback:**
- Ask user for their initials if not known
- Sanitize title: lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens, max 50 chars for description

### 2.2 Check Current Git State

```bash
git status --porcelain
git branch --show-current
```

**If uncommitted changes exist:**

Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
header: "Uncommitted Changes"
question: "You have uncommitted changes. How should I handle them?"
options:
  - label: "Stash changes"
    description: "Save changes to stash, can be restored later"
  - label: "Commit changes"
    description: "Commit current changes before switching branches"
  - label: "Discard changes"
    description: "Warning: This will lose your uncommitted work"
  - label: "Abort"
    description: "Cancel and let me handle it manually"
```

### 2.3 Create and Switch to Branch

**If branch doesn't exist locally or remotely:**

```bash
# Determine base branch
BASE=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||') || BASE="main"

# Fetch latest
git fetch origin $BASE

# Create branch from latest base
git checkout -b {branchName} origin/$BASE
```

**If branch exists locally:**

```bash
git checkout {branchName}
```

**If branch exists only on remote:**

```bash
git checkout -b {branchName} origin/{branchName}
```

### 2.4 Verify Branch Creation (REQUIRED)

**ALWAYS run this verification:**

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**The output MUST match the target `branchName`.** If not, something failed - report to user and abort.

### 2.5 Confirm Branch to User

Display confirmation:

```
✓ Branch: {branchName}
  Source: {Linear's suggested name | Generated from issue}

Proceeding with issue analysis...
```

**Only after this confirmation may you proceed to the next step.**

---

## Step 3: Parse and Present Issue Context

### 3.1 Parse Issue Description

Analyze the issue description to extract:

**Requirements:**

- Look for bullet points, numbered lists
- Sections labeled "Requirements", "Acceptance Criteria", "Tasks"
- User story format ("As a... I want... So that...")

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Explicit criteria sections
- "Done when..." statements
- Verification checkpoints

**Technical Notes:**

- Implementation hints
- API specifications
- Database changes mentioned
- Related files or components

### 3.2 Present Issue Summary

Show the user what was found:

```
Linear Issue: {identifier}

Title: {title}

Description:
---
{description - first 500 chars}
{if longer: "... [truncated, full description will be used]"}
---

State: {state}
Priority: {priority}
Labels: {labels}
Project: {project}

Recommended Branch: {branchName}

Comments: {count} comments found
{if comments exist: show key points from recent comments}

Requirements Identified:
- {requirement 1}
- {requirement 2}
- ...

Acceptance Criteria:
- {criterion 1}
- {criterion 2}
- ...
```

---

## Step 4: Codebase Exploration (PLANNING PHASE)

**CRITICAL:** Linear issues are typically product-focused and lack technical implementation details. **ALWAYS** perform extensive codebase exploration to understand how to implement the feature, regardless of how the issue is written.

### 4.1 Why This Phase Is Essential

Linear issues often describe:
- **What** the user should be able to do (user stories)
- **Why** it matters (business value)
- **Acceptance criteria** (verification conditions)

They typically do NOT describe:
- Which files/modules to modify
- What patterns to follow
- How existing similar features are implemented
- Technical constraints or dependencies

**Your job is to bridge this gap through thorough exploration.**

### 4.2 Mandatory Exploration Steps

**ALWAYS perform these steps, even if the issue seems straightforward:**

1. **Search for similar features/patterns:**

   - Use Glob and Grep to find related code
   - Look for existing implementations of similar functionality
   - Identify relevant modules, services, or components

2. **Use the Explore agent:**

   ```
   Task tool with subagent_type=Explore:
   "Find existing implementations related to {feature description from issue}.
    Identify relevant files, patterns, and conventions used in this codebase."
   ```

3. **Identify key files and patterns:**
   - List files that will likely need modification
   - Note existing patterns to follow
   - Find test patterns for similar features

### 4.3 Present Findings

After exploration, present findings to the user:

```
Codebase Exploration Results:

Relevant Files Found:
- {file 1} - {why relevant}
- {file 2} - {why relevant}

Existing Patterns:
- {pattern description} in {location}

Similar Implementations:
- {feature} in {files} - could serve as reference

Suggested Approach:
{brief technical approach based on findings}
```

---

## Step 5: Upfront Questions (PLANNING PHASE)

**CRITICAL:** Tend towards asking questions rather than plunging into implementation. The goal is to fully understand requirements before writing any code.

### 5.1 Identify Ambiguities

Review the issue and exploration results to identify:

- Unclear requirements or acceptance criteria
- Multiple valid technical approaches
- Scope boundaries (what's in/out)
- Dependencies on other work
- Testing expectations

### 5.2 Ask Clarifying Questions

**ALWAYS** use AskUserQuestion for each unclear aspect before proceeding.

**Example questions to consider:**

```yaml
header: "Implementation Scope"
question: "The issue mentions {feature}. Should this include {related functionality} or just the core feature?"
options:
  - label: "Core feature only"
    description: "Minimal implementation as described"
  - label: "Include {related functionality}"
    description: "Broader scope with additional features"
```

```yaml
header: "Technical Approach"
question: "I found two patterns in the codebase for similar features. Which approach should we follow?"
options:
  - label: "Pattern A - {description}"
    description: "Used in {files}"
  - label: "Pattern B - {description}"
    description: "Used in {files}"
```

```yaml
header: "Testing Requirements"
question: "What level of test coverage is expected?"
options:
  - label: "Unit tests only"
    description: "Test individual functions/methods"
  - label: "Unit + integration tests"
    description: "Also test component interactions"
  - label: "Full coverage including E2E"
    description: "Complete test suite"
```

### 5.3 Create Technical Plan

After gathering answers, create a comprehensive technical plan that translates the product requirements into a concrete implementation approach:

Read the technical plan template from `assets/technical-plan.md` and populate it based on the gathered context and user answers.

**Present this plan to the user and get confirmation before proceeding to implementation approach selection.**

---

## Step 6: Implementation Approach Selection

### 6.1 Present Approach Options

Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
header: "Implementation Approach"
question: "How would you like to proceed with implementing this issue?"
options:
  - label: "Guided Implementation"
    description: "I'll create a detailed plan with tasks, then implement step-by-step with verification at each stage. Best for complex features."
  - label: "Context Setup Only"
    description: "I'll set up the branch and create a todo list, but you'll guide the implementation. Best when you know the approach."
  - label: "Autonomous Implementation"
    description: "I'll analyze the codebase, plan, implement, and verify. Check in when done. Best for straightforward tasks."
```

---

## Step 7: Workflow Execution by Approach

Read the implementation workflow for the selected approach from `references/implementation-workflows.md`. Follow the Guided, Context Setup, or Autonomous workflow based on the user's choice from Step 6.

---

## Step 8: Success Output

After setup is complete:

```
Linear Issue Implementation Started

Issue: {identifier} - {title}
Branch: {branchName} ✓ (already active)
Approach: {selected approach}

{Approach-specific next steps from Step 7}

Quick Commands:
- `/kramme:verify:run` - Run verification checks
- `/kramme:pr:create` - Create PR when ready
- `/kramme:pr:code-review` - Review changes for issues
```

---

## Important Constraints

### No AI Attribution

**NEVER** add Claude attribution to commits or code. See `kramme:git:recreate-commits` skill.

### Linear Issue Linking

When creating commits, **PREFER** including issue reference:

- `WAN-123: Add platform picker guard`
- `Fixes WAN-123`

### Verification Before Completion

**ALWAYS** run verification before claiming completion. Use `kramme:verify:run` skill.

### Respect Existing Patterns

**ALWAYS** search for and follow existing patterns in the codebase before implementing.
