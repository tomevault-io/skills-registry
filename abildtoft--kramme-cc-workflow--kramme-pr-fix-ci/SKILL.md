# Iterate on PR Until CI Passes

Continuously iterate on the current branch until all CI checks pass and review feedback is addressed.

**Requires**: GitHub CLI (`gh`) or GitLab CLI (`glab`) authenticated and available.

## Options

**Flags:**
- `--fixup` - Use fixup commits to amend existing branch commits instead of creating new commits. Requires force push. Orphan files (not touched by any branch commit, including files last modified on the base branch) are committed as new.
- `--no-consolidate` - Skip the consolidation prompt after CI passes. Use for scripting or when you want to keep `[FIX PIPELINE]` commits separate.

---

## Step 0: Detect Platform

Determine whether this is a GitHub or GitLab repository:

```bash
git remote -v | head -1
```

- If remote contains `github.com` → use **GitHub** commands
- If remote contains `gitlab.com` or other GitLab instance → use **GitLab** commands

---

## GitHub Flow

### Step 1: Identify the PR

```bash
gh pr view --json number,url,headRefName,baseRefName
```

If no PR exists for the current branch, stop and inform the user.

### Step 2: Check CI Status First

```bash
gh pr checks --json name,state,bucket,link,workflow
```

The `bucket` field categorizes state into: `pass`, `fail`, `pending`, `skipping`, or `cancel`.

**Important:** If any of these checks are still `pending`, wait before proceeding:
- `sentry` / `sentry-io`
- `codecov`
- `cursor` / `bugbot` / `seer`
- Any linter or code analysis checks

These bots may post additional feedback comments once their checks complete. Waiting avoids duplicate work.

### Step 3: Gather Review Feedback

**Review Comments and Status:**
```bash
gh pr view --json reviews,comments,reviewDecision
```

**Inline Code Review Comments:**
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments
```

**PR Conversation Comments (includes bot comments):**
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr_number}/comments
```

### Step 4: Investigate Failures

```bash
# List recent runs for this branch
gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 5 --json databaseId,name,status,conclusion

# View failed logs for a specific run
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

Do NOT assume what failed based on the check name alone. Always read the actual logs.

### Step 5-7: Fix, Commit, Push

See common steps below.

### Step 8: Wait for CI

```bash
gh pr checks --watch --interval 30
```

This waits until all checks complete. Exit code 0 means all passed, exit code 1 means failures.

---

## GitLab Flow

### Step 1: Identify the PR

**Using GitLab MCP server (preferred if available):**
```
mcp__gitlab__get_merge_request with source_branch: <current-branch>
```

**Using glab CLI:**
```bash
glab mr view --web=false
```

**Using glab to list PRs for current branch:**
```bash
glab mr list --source-branch=$(git branch --show-current)
```

If no PR exists for the current branch, stop and inform the user.

### Step 2: Check CI Status First

**Using GitLab MCP server (preferred):**
```
mcp__gitlab__list_pipelines with ref: <current-branch>
mcp__gitlab__get_pipeline with pipeline_id: <id>
mcp__gitlab__list_pipeline_jobs with pipeline_id: <id>
```

**Using glab CLI:**
```bash
# View pipeline status for current branch
glab ci status

# List recent pipelines
glab ci list --branch $(git branch --show-current)

# View specific pipeline
glab ci view <pipeline-id>
```

Pipeline statuses: `created`, `waiting_for_resource`, `preparing`, `pending`, `running`, `success`, `failed`, `canceled`, `skipped`, `manual`, `scheduled`.

**Important:** If pipeline is still `running` or `pending`, wait before proceeding.

### Step 3: Gather Review Feedback

**Using GitLab MCP server (preferred):**
```
mcp__gitlab__get_merge_request with merge_request_iid: <iid>
mcp__gitlab__mr_discussions with merge_request_iid: <iid>
```

**Using glab CLI:**
```bash
# View PR details including approval status
glab mr view <mr-iid>

# View PR notes/comments
glab mr note list <mr-iid>
```

### Step 4: Investigate Failures

**Using GitLab MCP server (preferred):**
```
mcp__gitlab__list_pipeline_jobs with pipeline_id: <id>, scope: "failed"
mcp__gitlab__get_pipeline_job_output with job_id: <id>
```

**Using glab CLI:**
```bash
# List jobs in a pipeline
glab ci list --pipeline <pipeline-id>

# View job log (trace)
glab ci trace <job-id>

# Or view the entire pipeline's failed jobs
glab ci view <pipeline-id> --web=false
```

Do NOT assume what failed based on the job name alone. Always read the actual logs.

### Step 5-7: Fix, Commit, Push

See common steps below.

### Step 8: Wait for CI

**Using glab CLI:**
```bash
# Watch pipeline status
glab ci status --live

# Or poll manually
glab ci status --branch $(git branch --show-current)
```

---

## Common Steps (Both Platforms)

### Step 5: Validate Feedback

For each piece of feedback (CI failure or review comment):

1. **Read the relevant code** - Understand the context before making changes
2. **Verify the issue is real** - Not all feedback is correct; reviewers and bots can be wrong
3. **Check if already addressed** - The issue may have been fixed in a subsequent commit
4. **Skip invalid feedback** - If the concern is not legitimate, move on

### Step 6: Address Valid Issues

Make minimal, targeted code changes. Only fix what is actually broken.

### Step 7: Commit and Push

**If `--fixup` mode is enabled:** See Step 7b (Fixup Commit Flow) below.

**Default (no flag):**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "[FIX PIPELINE] <descriptive message of what was fixed>"
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

The `[FIX PIPELINE]` prefix marks commits as iteration fixes, making them easy to identify and consolidate later (see Step 10).

### Step 7b: Fixup Commit Flow (when `--fixup` is enabled)

Read and follow the fixup commit flow from `references/fixup-flow.md`. This covers base branch detection, file-to-commit mapping, fixup commit creation, autosquash rebase, and force push with lease.

### Step 9: Repeat

Return to Step 2 if:
- Any CI checks failed
- New review feedback appeared

Continue until all checks pass and no unaddressed feedback remains.

---

### Step 10: Consolidation Phase (Default Mode Only)

**Skip this step if:** `--fixup` mode was used, or `--no-consolidate` flag is set.

Read and follow the consolidation flow from `references/consolidation-flow.md`. This covers detecting `[FIX PIPELINE]` commits, prompting the user for consolidation options (automated, interactive, or keep separate), mapping commits to targets, executing rebase, and force pushing.

---

## Exit Conditions

**Success:**
- All CI checks are green
- No unaddressed human review feedback
- (Default mode) Consolidation completed or user chose to keep separate commits

**Ask for Help:**
- Same failure persists after 3 attempts (likely a flaky test or deeper issue)
- Review feedback requires clarification or decision from the user
- CI failure is unrelated to branch changes (infrastructure issue)
- Consolidation rebase failed due to conflicts (user must resolve manually)

**Stop Immediately:**
- No PR exists for the current branch
- Branch is out of sync and needs rebase (inform user)

---

## Tips

**GitHub:**
- Use `gh pr checks --required` to focus only on required checks
- Use `gh run view <run-id> --verbose` to see all job steps, not just failures
- If a check is from an external service, the `link` field provides the URL

**GitLab:**
- Use `glab ci retry <job-id>` to retry a single failed job
- Use `glab ci run` to trigger a new pipeline manually
- Check for `allow_failure: true` jobs that don't block the pipeline
- Use the GitLab MCP server tools when available for richer data access

**Default Mode (New Commits):**
- Creates commits with `[FIX PIPELINE]` prefix for easy identification
- No force push during iteration (safer for collaborators watching the PR)
- After CI passes, offers to consolidate `[FIX PIPELINE]` commits into original commits
- Use `--no-consolidate` to skip the consolidation prompt
- Alternative: Use "Squash and merge" in GitHub/GitLab to combine all commits when merging

**Fixup Mode (`--fixup`):**
- Use when you want to keep commit history clean during PR iteration
- Orphan files (files not touched by any existing branch commit, including files last modified on the base branch) become new commits automatically
- If rebase conflicts occur, the iteration continues with a regular commit
- Uses `--force-with-lease` for a safer force push after rebase (still requires coordination and an up-to-date fetch)

**Choosing a Mode:**
- **Default**: Working with others, want visible iteration history, prefer to consolidate at the end
- **`--fixup`**: Working alone, want clean history throughout, comfortable with force push
