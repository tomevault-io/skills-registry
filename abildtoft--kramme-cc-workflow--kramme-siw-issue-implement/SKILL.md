## Status Update Procedure

**CRITICAL — MANDATORY for every status change.** Every time an issue's status changes (to "In Progress", "IN REVIEW", or "DONE"), you MUST update ALL THREE files below. Never update one without the others.

**Checklist (all three required):**

- [ ] **Issue file** (`siw/issues/ISSUE-{prefix}-{number}-*.md`) — Change the `**Status:**` line to the new status
- [ ] **Overview** (`siw/OPEN_ISSUES_OVERVIEW.md`) — Update the issue's row in the table to match the new status
- [ ] **Log** (`siw/LOG.md`) — Update the "Current Progress" section to reflect the status change

Skipping any of these files leaves the tracking state inconsistent. Treat this as a single atomic operation.

This procedure is referenced as **"Run the Status Update Procedure"** throughout this skill.

---

## Step 1: Parse Arguments and Read Issue

### 1.1 Extract Issue Identifier from Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` contains the issue identifier provided by the user.

**Accepted formats:**
- Full format: `ISSUE-G-001`, `ISSUE-P1-001`, `ISSUE-P2-001`, etc.
- Short format: `G-001`, `P1-001`, `P2-001`, etc.
- Legacy format: `ISSUE-001` or `001` (treated as `G-001`)

**Validation:**
- Extract the prefix (`G`, `P1`, `P2`, etc.) and numeric portion
- Pad number to 3 digits (1 → 001, 12 → 012)
- Default prefix is `G` if none provided (IDs like `G-001`)

**If no argument provided or invalid:**

```
Error: Please provide an issue identifier.

Usage: /kramme:siw:issue-implement <prefix-number>
Examples:
  /kramme:siw:issue-implement G-001      # General issue
  /kramme:siw:issue-implement P1-001     # Phase 1 issue
  /kramme:siw:issue-implement ISSUE-G-001

The issue can be specified as G-001, P1-001, ISSUE-G-001, etc.
```

**Action:** Abort.

### 1.2 Find and Read Issue File

Search for issue file in `siw/issues/` directory:

```bash
ls siw/issues/ISSUE-{prefix}-{padded_number}-*.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If found:**
- Read the full issue file
- Extract:
  - Title (from `# ISSUE-{prefix}-{number}:` header)
  - Status, Priority, Phase, Related tasks (from frontmatter line)
  - Problem description
  - Context (if present)
  - Scope (in/out)
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Technical Notes (if present)

**If not found:**

```
Error: Issue {prefix}-{number} not found.

Please verify:
  - The issue exists in the siw/issues/ directory
  - You have the correct issue identifier (e.g., G-001, P1-001)

Available issues:
{list files in siw/issues/ directory}

To create a new issue, run /kramme:siw:issue-define
```

**Action:** Abort.

---

## Step 2: Verify Git State

Check current git status (works on current branch by default):

```bash
git status --porcelain
git branch --show-current
```

**If uncommitted changes exist:**

Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
header: "Uncommitted Changes Detected"
question: "You have uncommitted changes. How should I proceed?"
options:
  - label: "Continue anyway"
    description: "Work with current changes (recommended if changes are related)"
  - label: "Stash changes"
    description: "Save changes to stash, can be restored later"
  - label: "Abort"
    description: "Cancel and let me handle it manually"
```

**Display current branch:**

```
Working on branch: {branch_name}
```

---

## Step 3: Parse and Present Issue Context

### 3.1 Present Issue Summary

Show the user what was found:

```
Issue: {prefix}-{number}

Title: {title}

Problem:
---
{problem section}
---

Status: {status}
Priority: {priority}
Related: {related tasks}

Acceptance Criteria:
- {criterion 1}
- {criterion 2}
...

Technical Notes:
{if present, show summary}
```

---

## Step 4: Codebase Exploration (PLANNING PHASE)

**CRITICAL:** **ALWAYS** perform extensive codebase exploration to understand how to implement the feature, regardless of how detailed the issue is.

### 4.1 Why This Phase Is Essential

Issues describe:
- **What** should be accomplished
- **Why** it matters
- **Acceptance criteria** for verification

They may NOT describe:
- Which files/modules to modify
- What patterns to follow
- How existing similar features are implemented

**Your job is to bridge this gap through thorough exploration.**

### 4.2 Mandatory Exploration Steps

**ALWAYS perform these steps:**

1. **Check supporting specs (if they exist):**
   ```bash
   ls siw/supporting-specs/ 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If supporting specs exist, identify which ones are relevant:
   - Data model specs for entity-related work
   - API specs for endpoint-related work
   - UI specs for frontend-related work
   Read relevant sections for detailed requirements.

2. **Search for similar features/patterns:**
   - Use Glob and Grep to find related code
   - Look for existing implementations of similar functionality
   - Identify relevant modules, services, or components

3. **Use the Explore agent:**
   ```
   Task tool with subagent_type=Explore:
   "Find existing implementations related to {feature description from issue}.
    Identify relevant files, patterns, and conventions used in this codebase."
   ```

4. **Identify key files and patterns:**
   - List files that will likely need modification
   - Note existing patterns to follow
   - Find test patterns for similar features

### 4.3 Present Findings

```
Codebase Exploration Results:

Supporting Specs Referenced:
- siw/supporting-specs/01-data-model.md#user-entity (if applicable)
- siw/supporting-specs/02-api-specification.md#endpoints (if applicable)

Relevant Files Found:
- {file 1} - {why relevant}
- {file 2} - {why relevant}

Existing Patterns:
- {pattern description} in {location}

Similar Implementations:
- {feature} in {files} - could serve as reference

Suggested Approach:
{brief technical approach based on findings}
```

---

## Step 5: Upfront Questions (PLANNING PHASE)

**CRITICAL:** Ask questions rather than making assumptions. The goal is to fully understand before writing code.

### 5.1 Identify Ambiguities

Review the issue and exploration results to identify:

- Unclear requirements or acceptance criteria
- Multiple valid technical approaches
- Scope boundaries (what's in/out)
- Dependencies on other work
- Testing expectations

### 5.2 Ask Clarifying Questions

**ALWAYS** use AskUserQuestion for unclear aspects.

**Example questions:**

```yaml
header: "Implementation Scope"
question: "The issue mentions {feature}. Should this include {related functionality}?"
options:
  - label: "Core feature only"
    description: "Minimal implementation as described"
  - label: "Include {related functionality}"
    description: "Broader scope"
```

```yaml
header: "Technical Approach"
question: "I found two patterns. Which should we follow?"
options:
  - label: "Pattern A - {description}"
    description: "Used in {files}"
  - label: "Pattern B - {description}"
    description: "Used in {files}"
```

### 5.3 Create Technical Plan

After gathering answers, create a comprehensive plan:

```
Technical Implementation Plan for {prefix}-{number}

## Summary
{One paragraph describing what will be built}

## Requirements -> Technical Approach
| Requirement | Technical Implementation |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| {criterion 1} | {how it will be implemented} |
| {criterion 2} | {how it will be implemented} |

## Files to Modify/Create
- {file 1} - {what changes}
- {file 2} - {what changes}

## Patterns to Follow
Based on exploration of {similar feature}:
- {pattern 1}
- {pattern 2}

## Implementation Steps
1. {step 1}
2. {step 2}
3. {step 3}

## Testing Approach
- {test type}: {what to test}

## Open Questions (if any)
- {remaining uncertainties}
```

**Present plan and get confirmation before proceeding.**

---

## Step 6: Implementation Approach Selection

Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
header: "Implementation Approach"
question: "How would you like to proceed?"
options:
  - label: "Guided Implementation"
    description: "Step-by-step with verification at each stage. Best for complex work."
  - label: "Context Setup Only"
    description: "I'll create a todo list, but you guide implementation. Best when you know the approach."
  - label: "Autonomous Implementation"
    description: "I'll implement and verify, check in when done. Best for straightforward tasks."
```

---

## Step 7: Workflow Execution by Approach

### 7.1 Guided Implementation (Option 1)

**Goal:** Implement with user verification at each step.

1. **Create Todo List**
   - Break requirements into discrete tasks
   - Identify dependencies

2. **Set Status to "In Progress"** — Run the Status Update Procedure (all 3 files).

3. **Begin Implementation**
   - Work through tasks one at a time
   - **ALWAYS** ask user to review after each task
   - Update siw/LOG.md as tasks complete

### 7.2 Context Setup Only (Option 2)

**Goal:** Prepare everything, let user drive.

1. **Create Todo List from Acceptance Criteria**

2. **Set Status to "In Progress"** — Run the Status Update Procedure (all 3 files).

3. **Provide Starting Points**
   ```
   Context set up. Here's where to start:

   Issue: {prefix}-{number}
   Branch: {current_branch}

   Likely affected areas:
   - {file/module 1} - {why}
   - {file/module 2} - {why}

   Similar implementations to reference:
   - {existing feature} - {relevance}

   Todo list created. Ready when you want to begin.
   ```

### 7.3 Autonomous Implementation (Option 3)

**Goal:** Complete with minimal interaction.

1. **Deep Analysis**
   - Search for related files
   - Read similar implementations
   - Understand testing patterns

2. **Create Comprehensive Plan**
   - Detailed task breakdown

3. **Set Status to "In Progress"** — Run the Status Update Procedure (all 3 files).

4. **Implement Iteratively**
   - Work through all tasks
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Run tests after changes
   - Document decisions

5. **Verification Phase**
   - Invoke `kramme:verify:run` skill
   - Fix any issues
   - Ensure all criteria met

6. **Sync Decisions to Spec**
   - Review siw/LOG.md for decisions made during implementation
   - Update spec with any decisions not already reflected
   - Ensure spec matches actual implementation

7. **Present Results**
   ```
   Implementation Complete

   Issue: {prefix}-{number}
   Branch: {branch}

   Changes Made:
   - {summary}

   Files Modified:
   - {list}

   Verification Results:
   - Tests: {status}
   - Build: {status}

   Acceptance Criteria:
   - [x] {criterion 1}
   - [x] {criterion 2}

   Ready for review. Run /kramme:pr:create when ready.
   ```

---

## Step 8: Verify Status Update Completed

**CRITICAL:** Before proceeding, confirm that the Status Update Procedure was executed in Step 7. All three files must now show "In Progress":

- [ ] `siw/issues/ISSUE-{prefix}-{number}-*.md` — Status line reads: `**Status:** In Progress | **Priority:** {priority} | **Related:** {tasks}`
- [ ] `siw/OPEN_ISSUES_OVERVIEW.md` — Issue row shows "In Progress"
- [ ] `siw/LOG.md` — Current Progress section reads:
  ```markdown
  ## Current Progress

  **Last Updated:** {date}
  **Quick Summary:** Implementing {prefix}-{number}: {title}

  ### Project Status
  - **Status:** In Progress | **Current Issue:** {prefix}-{number}

  ### Last Completed
  - Started implementation of {prefix}-{number}

  ### Next Steps
  1. {next task from plan}
  ```

**If any file was not updated in Step 7, update it now.** Do not proceed to Step 9 until all three files reflect "In Progress".

---

## Step 9: Success Output

```
Issue Implementation Started

Issue: {prefix}-{number} - {title}
Branch: {branch}
Approach: {selected approach}

{Approach-specific next steps}

Quick Commands:
- /kramme:verify:run - Run verification checks
- /kramme:pr:create - Create PR when ready
- /kramme:pr:code-review - Review changes for issues
```

---

## Step 10: Sync Decisions to Specification (COMPLETION PHASE)

**CRITICAL:** Before marking implementation complete, ensure the specification reflects all decisions made during implementation.

### 10.1 Review siw/LOG.md Decision Log

Check siw/LOG.md for any decisions recorded during implementation:
- New decisions made that aren't in the spec
- Changes to originally planned approach
- Discovered constraints or requirements
- Technical choices that affect future work

### 10.2 Compare Decisions Against Spec (and Supporting Specs)

For each decision in siw/LOG.md:
1. Check if the decision aligns with what's documented in the spec or supporting specs
2. Identify decisions that:
   - Contradict the spec (spec needs updating)
   - Add new information (spec needs expanding)
   - Clarify ambiguities (spec needs refinement)

**If supporting specs exist (`siw/supporting-specs/`)**, route decisions by topic:
- Data model decisions → `*-data-model*.md`
- API decisions → `*-api*.md`
- UI/frontend decisions → `*-ui*.md` or `*-frontend*.md`
- User story updates → `*-user-stories*.md`
- Default → main spec if no matching supporting spec

### 10.3 Present Spec Update Candidates

If misalignments found:

```
Spec Sync Check

The following decisions from implementation don't match the current specification:

Decisions needing spec update:
1. Decision #{n}: {title}
   - siw/LOG.md says: {decision}
   - Spec says: {current spec content or "not mentioned"}
   - Target file: {main spec or relevant supporting spec}
   - Recommendation: {update/add/clarify}

2. Decision #{n}: {title}
   ...
```

Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
header: "Update Specification"
question: "Should I update the specification to reflect these implementation decisions?"
options:
  - label: "Update spec with all decisions"
    description: "Add all listed decisions to the specification"
  - label: "Review each decision"
    description: "Let me choose which decisions to include"
  - label: "Skip spec update"
    description: "Keep spec as-is (decisions remain only in siw/LOG.md)"
```

### 10.4 Update Specification File(s)

For selected decisions, update the appropriate spec file (main spec or supporting spec).

**CRITICAL for supporting specs:** Don't just add to a "Design Decisions" section - **update the actual spec content** to reflect the decision. Supporting specs should always reflect current reality.

**Example:** If a decision changes an API endpoint from POST to PUT:
- **Wrong:** Add "Decision #5: Changed to PUT" to Design Decisions section
- **Right:** Update the endpoint definition in the API spec to show PUT, add brief note about why

**When to update supporting spec content directly:**
- Data model changes → Update entity definitions in `*-data-model*.md`
- API changes → Update endpoint contracts in `*-api*.md`
- UI changes → Update component specs in `*-ui*.md`
- Architecture changes → Update diagrams/descriptions in architecture specs

**When to use Design Decisions section (main spec only):**
- Cross-cutting decisions that affect multiple areas
- High-level architectural choices
- Decisions that don't map to a specific spec section

**Migration format for main spec's `## Design Decisions` section:**

```markdown
### Decision #5: Make ActionByUserId Nullable
**Date:** 2025-11-05 | **Source:** ISSUE-G-003 implementation

**Context:** Not all entities undergo this action, so the field shouldn't be required at the database level.
**Decision:** Nullable at storage; required parameter when calling PerformAction().
**Rationale:** Matches existing ActionAt pattern; semantically correct representation.
```

**Note:** The spec version is more concise than LOG.md - omit alternatives and detailed impact (those stay in LOG.md for historical reference).

### 10.5 Confirm Sync Complete

```
Specification(s) Updated

Main spec ({spec_filename}):
- Decision #{n}: {title}

Supporting specs:
- siw/supporting-specs/01-data-model.md: Decision #{n}: {title}
- siw/supporting-specs/02-api-specification.md: Decision #{n}: {title}

Sections updated:
- Design Decisions
- {other sections if applicable}

Specs and siw/LOG.md are now aligned.
```

**If no updates needed:**
```
Spec Sync Check: All implementation decisions align with the specifications.
No updates needed.
```

---

## Step 11: Close Issue and Check Phase Completion (COMPLETION PHASE)

After verification passes and the implementation is complete, close out tracking for the issue.

### 11.1 Document Resolution in Issue File

Add a `## Resolution` section to the issue file with:

```markdown
## Resolution

**Date:** {date}

### Summary
{One paragraph describing what was done to resolve the issue}

### Changes Made
- {file 1} - {what changed}
- {file 2} - {what changed}

### Key Decisions
- {any decisions made during implementation, if applicable}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT delete the issue file. The issue file is preserved as a record of the work.

### 11.2 Determine Confidence and Set Status

Use AskUserQuestion:

```yaml
header: "Issue Resolution Confidence"
question: "How confident are you that this solution is correct and complete?"
options:
  - label: "Confident — mark as DONE"
    description: "Solution is verified and complete. No further review needed."
  - label: "Needs review — mark as IN REVIEW"
    description: "Solution works but would benefit from human review before considering it done."
```

**If "Confident":** Set status to `DONE`.
**If "Needs review":** Set status to `IN REVIEW`.

### 11.3 Update All Tracking Files

**CRITICAL:** Run the Status Update Procedure with the chosen status (`DONE` or `IN REVIEW`). All three files:

- [ ] **Issue file** — Set `**Status:**` to the chosen status
- [ ] **Overview** (`siw/OPEN_ISSUES_OVERVIEW.md`) — Update the issue row to match
- [ ] **Log** (`siw/LOG.md`) — Move the issue into "Last Completed", set "Next Steps" to the next READY issue

Do NOT proceed to 11.4 until all three files are updated.

### 11.4 If This Was the Last Open Issue in a Phase, Confirm Phase Completion

Only applies to phase-prefixed issues (`P1-*`, `P2-*`, etc.). Skip for `G-*`.

1. Determine the phase number from the prefix (`P1` → Phase 1, `P2` → Phase 2, etc.)
2. In `siw/OPEN_ISSUES_OVERVIEW.md`, find that phase section and check whether any issues in that section are still **not** `DONE` (READY / IN PROGRESS / IN REVIEW).

**If no open issues remain in that phase:** Ask the user:

```yaml
header: "Mark Phase Complete?"
question: "All issues in Phase {N} are now DONE. Should I mark the entire phase as DONE?"
options:
  - label: "Yes, mark Phase {N} as DONE"
    description: "Update the Phase {N} section header in OPEN_ISSUES_OVERVIEW.md"
  - label: "No, leave phase unmarked"
    description: "Keep the current phase header as-is"
```

**If user selects "Yes":**
- Update the phase section header in `siw/OPEN_ISSUES_OVERVIEW.md` by appending ` (DONE)` (e.g., `## Phase 2: Core Features (DONE)`)
- Do not double-append if it is already marked

### 11.5 Post-Phase LOG.md Update (only if phase marked DONE in 11.4)

If a phase was marked DONE in 11.4, update `siw/LOG.md` to note the phase completion in the summary/last-completed entry.

---

## Important Constraints

### No AI Attribution

**NEVER** add Claude attribution to commits or code.

### Verification Before Completion

**ALWAYS** run verification before claiming completion. Use `kramme:verify:run` skill.

### Respect Existing Patterns

**ALWAYS** search for and follow existing patterns before implementing.

### Update siw/LOG.md

**ALWAYS** update siw/LOG.md with progress and decisions.

### Status Updates Are Atomic

**ALWAYS** update all three tracking files together when changing issue status. See the Status Update Procedure at the top of this skill. Never update just the issue file or just the overview — all three files must be updated as a single operation.

### Sync Decisions to Spec

**ALWAYS** run Step 10 (Spec Sync) before marking implementation complete. The specification must reflect the actual implementation.

---

## Error Handling

### Git Errors
- Merge conflicts: Ask user to resolve
- Stash failures: Report and suggest manual handling

### Issue File Errors
- Malformed issue: Report what's missing, suggest `/kramme:siw:issue-define` to fix

### Implementation Errors
- Test failures: Present errors, ask how to proceed
- Build failures: Show full error output
