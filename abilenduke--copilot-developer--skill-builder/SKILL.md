# Skill Builder

## HARD RULES

These rules are absolute. No exceptions.

### Rule 1: ALWAYS walk through discovery

Never generate a skill from a one-line description. Always walk through the interactive phases to understand purpose, scope, and boundaries. Even experienced users benefit from Phase 1 qualification.

### Rule 2: NEVER overwrite without confirmation

If a skill directory already exists, STOP and ask: "The skill '{name}' already exists. Do you want to update it or create a different skill?" Never silently overwrite.

### Rule 3: ALWAYS register in boost.json

Every domain skill must be added to the `skills` array in `boost.json`. Workflow skills invoked via slash commands do not go in boost.json.

### Rule 4: ALWAYS check for overlapping skills

Before creating a new skill, compare its scope against every existing skill. If overlap exists, propose merging or boundary clarification before proceeding.

---

## Purpose

This is a **meta-skill** that builds other skills through interactive Q&A. It ensures every new skill follows project conventions, has proper frontmatter, uses `<code-snippet>` blocks for code examples, and integrates with boost.json and hook mappings.

## Skill Type Classification

Every skill falls into one of three types. Identifying the type early determines the output shape.

| Type | Purpose | Output Shape | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Domain Knowledge** | Teaches patterns for a code area | SKILL.md with code snippets, "When to Apply", "Common Pitfalls" | `pest-testing`, `content-publishing`, `affiliate-tracking` |
| **Interactive Workflow** | Guides multi-step processes | SKILL.md with phases, progress indicator, templates/, examples/ | `plan`, `execute`, `feature` |
| **Utility** | Cross-cutting conventions | SKILL.md with rules and mapping tables | `documentation-maintenance` |

### Key Differences

- **Domain skills** go in `boost.json` — they auto-activate based on context
- **Workflow skills** are invoked via slash commands — they do NOT go in `boost.json`
- **Utility skills** go in `boost.json` — they auto-activate like domain skills
- Only workflow skills typically need `templates/` and `examples/` subdirectories
- Domain skills embed code patterns inline using `<code-snippet>` blocks

---

## First Steps

When this skill is invoked:

1. Read the supporting files in this skill directory:
    - `templates/questions.md` — question bank organized by phase (your toolkit, not a script)
    - `templates/skill-template-domain.md` — output template for domain knowledge skills
    - `templates/skill-template-workflow.md` — output template for workflow skills
    - `examples/example-domain-skill.md` — completed domain skill showing expected quality
    - `examples/example-workflow-skill.md` — completed workflow skill showing expected quality
2. List existing skills by reading directories under `.claude/skills/`
3. Read `boost.json` to see which skills are registered
4. Ask: "What skill do you want to build? Describe the problem it solves or the task it automates."
5. Begin Phase 1 immediately

---

## How It Works: The 6-Phase Discovery Process

The process is **conversational and interactive** — not a form to fill out. You guide the developer through 6 phases, asking probing questions, challenging weak answers, and building the skill incrementally.

### Critical Rules

1. **Ask ONE question at a time** (sometimes two if tightly related). This is a conversation, not an interrogation.
2. **Reflect back what you heard.** After each answer, briefly summarize your understanding before moving on.
3. **Challenge weak answers.** "It should cover everything" is not a scope boundary. Push back.
4. **Offer informed suggestions.** If you see overlap with existing skills, flag it. If a scope is too broad, suggest splitting.
5. **Track progress visibly.** Show the progress indicator at the start of each response.
6. **Build incrementally.** Write to disk at checkpoints, not just at the end.
7. **Use the question bank as a toolkit.** Read `templates/questions.md` for inspiration but never ask questions robotically.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Qualification & Purpose (WHY THIS SKILL)

**Goal**: Understand what problem the skill solves and whether it should exist.

Explore:
- What task do you find yourself repeating?
- What goes wrong when Claude doesn't have this guidance?
- Is there an existing skill that partially covers this?
- Could this be a section added to an existing skill instead?
- Who uses it — you or Claude? (Skills guide Claude's behavior)
- When should it activate? What phrases or code paths trigger it?

**Classify**: Based on answers, identify the skill type (domain / workflow / utility).

**Output**: Purpose statement + activation triggers + skill type classification.

### Phase 2: Scope & Boundaries (WHAT IT COVERS)

**Goal**: Draw a sharp line around what's in and what's out.

Explore:
- Can you describe the skill in one paragraph? If not, it's too big — split it.
- What code areas does it cover? What files/directories?
- What sibling skills exist? Where does this one start and they end?
- What's explicitly excluded?
- Does it chain with other skills? (feeds into or receives from)
- How many modes of operation? (>4 means reconsider scope)
- Does it need supporting files? (templates, examples, both, neither)

**Output**: Domain boundaries + supporting file decisions.

**Checkpoint**: Write skill name + one-paragraph description to disk as a draft.

### Phase 3: Instruction Design (HOW IT WORKS)

**Goal**: Design the internal structure of the SKILL.md.

Based on the skill type:

**For domain skills**:
- What are the 3-8 domain sections? (e.g., "Model Patterns", "Controller Conventions", "Testing")
- What code snippets illustrate the patterns? (pull from actual codebase where possible)
- What are the 3-5 most common pitfalls?
- What does a "bad" outcome look like? What constraints prevent it?

**For workflow skills**:
- How many phases? What's the goal of each?
- What checkpoints exist? When should output be written to disk?
- Does it need a progress indicator?
- What questions drive each phase? (build a question bank)
- What templates should be provided?
- What does a completed example look like?

**For utility skills**:
- What rules does it enforce?
- What mapping tables or reference data does it maintain?

**Output**: Section outline with content sketches.

**Checkpoint**: Write SKILL.md draft (frontmatter + skeleton with section headers).

### Phase 4: Security & Tool Constraints (PERMISSIONS)

**Goal**: Determine permission boundaries and integration points.

Explore:
- Does this skill need `allowed-tools` restrictions? (Most don't — only restrict if the skill should NOT edit files, run commands, etc.)
- Does it need a companion agent? (Heavy workflows that could overwhelm the main context benefit from a subagent)
- Does it need hook integration? (Domain skills covering specific code paths should be mapped in `doc-sync-hint.sh`)
- Should it appear in the documentation-maintenance mapping table?

**Output**: Permission spec + agent decision + hook mapping decision.

### Phase 5: Write the Skill (PRODUCE IT)

**Goal**: Create all skill files.

Actions:
1. Finalize SKILL.md from the Phase 3 skeleton — fill in all sections with real content
2. Write `templates/` files if the skill needs them
3. Write `examples/` files if the skill needs them
4. If a companion agent is needed, create it in `.claude/agents/`

**Checkpoint**: Review against the quality checklist below.

### Phase 6: Integration & Verification (WIRE IT UP)

**Goal**: Register the skill and verify everything works.

Actions:
1. Add to `boost.json` skills array (if domain or utility type)
2. Add hook mappings to `.claude/hooks/doc-sync-hint.sh` (if skill covers code paths that should trigger hints)
3. Add a row to the file-to-domain mapping table in `.claude/skills/documentation-maintenance/SKILL.md`
4. Run the quality checklist one final time
5. Provide test instructions: "Try activating this skill by [trigger]. It should [expected behavior]."

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any skill:

- [ ] YAML frontmatter has `name` (kebab-case, matches directory) and `description` (activation-friendly, uses `>-`)
- [ ] Description includes activation triggers (user phrases, code contexts)
- [ ] "When to Apply" section has specific bullet points
- [ ] Domain skills use `<code-snippet>` blocks for code examples (not markdown fences)
- [ ] Code snippets reflect actual codebase patterns (not generic examples)
- [ ] Common Pitfalls section exists with 3+ entries
- [ ] Skill name is kebab-case and matches the directory name
- [ ] No overlap with existing skills (or overlap is documented and intentional)
- [ ] Workflow skills have templates/ and/or examples/ if needed
- [ ] `boost.json` updated (domain/utility skills only)
- [ ] Documentation-maintenance mapping table updated

---

## Domain Skill Fast Path

For simple domain skills (the most common type), phases 1-3 are the core work. Offer to compress phases 4-6 when ALL of these are true:

- No special tool restrictions needed
- No companion agent needed
- Standard hook integration (just add to `doc-sync-hint.sh` case statement)
- No templates or examples needed

Say: "This looks like a standard domain skill. I can handle the integration steps (boost.json, hook mappings, doc-maintenance table) automatically. Want me to fast-track phases 4-6?"

---

## Handling Impatience

- **"Can we just skip to writing it?"** → "Let me speed up. I'll propose the structure and you correct me." Then present your best guess for the remaining phases and ask for confirm/correct.
- **"I already know what I want"** → Speed-run: have them describe the full skill, then validate against the quality checklist.
- **"This is too many questions"** → Batch remaining questions as a numbered list for one-shot answers.

---

## After Building

Once the skill is complete:

1. Summarize what was created (files, integration points)
2. Provide activation test instructions
3. Remind: "If this skill covers code paths that change frequently, the `documentation-maintenance` skill will flag when updates are needed."
