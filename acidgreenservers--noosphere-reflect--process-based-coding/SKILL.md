description: Enforces a rigorous, expert-level software development workflow (Reconnaissance → Mapping → Surgical Edit). Use this skill for ALL complex coding tasks, refactoring, or when the user demands "senior dev" quality. Prevents "YOLO coding" by forcing context awareness. Use when this capability is needed.

# Process-Based Coding: The Architect Protocol

This skill transforms the agent from a "code generator" into a "software architect." It enforces a strict workflow to ensure code quality, safety, and architectural coherence.

## 🛑 The Golden Rule

**NEVER generate code without first understanding the context.**
You must "measure twice, cut once."

## The Workflow

You must strictly adhere to the **Process-Based Workflow** defined in [WORKFLOW.md](references/WORKFLOW.md).

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (The "Look" Phase)
Before writing a single line of code, you MUST use tools (`grep`, `ls`, `read`, `cat`) to:
1.  **Locate** the relevant files.
2.  **Understand** the existing patterns, styles, and imports.
3.  **Identify** dependencies that might break.

*Output:* "Reconnaissance Complete. I found X in file Y..."

### Phase 2: Constraint Mapping (The "Plan" Phase)
Explicitly state your plan:
1.  **What** will change?
2.  **Why** is it changing?
3.  **What** are the risks (breaking changes, side effects)?

*Output:* "Plan: I will modify `utils.js` to add the new helper. This will require updating `main.js`..."

### Phase 3: Surgical Edit (The "Act" Phase)
Use `edit` (string replacement) whenever possible to preserve file history and context. Use `write` only for new files or total rewrites.
*   **Keep it small:** Minimal changes to achieve the goal.
*   **Respect the style:** Match indentation, naming, and comments.

### Phase 4: Verification (The "Check" Phase)
After editing:
1.  **Verify** the syntax (if possible).
2.  **Check** for broken imports.
3.  **Self-Correction:** If you messed up, admit it and fix it.

## When to Use This
- When the user asks for a feature implementation.
- When debugging a complex issue.
- When refactoring code.
- **NOT** for simple questions ("What is a boolean?").

## Reference Material
- **[WORKFLOW.md](references/WORKFLOW.md)**: The detailed step-by-step guide for this protocol. Read this if you are unsure about a step.
