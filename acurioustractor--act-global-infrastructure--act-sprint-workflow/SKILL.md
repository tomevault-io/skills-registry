# ACT Sprint Workflow

## When Triggered
- Sprint planning or backlog review
- Daily standup ("what should I work on?")
- System health checks across projects
- Creating new issues with auto-detection
- Velocity, burndown, or capacity questions

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `plan` | Recommend issues for next sprint based on velocity |
| `today` / `standup` | Daily report with yesterday's work and today's focus |
| `health` | Check all 6 ACT projects for issues |
| `create <title>` | Create issue with auto-detected fields |

## Quick Reference
