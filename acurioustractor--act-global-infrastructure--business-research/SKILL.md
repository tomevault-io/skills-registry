3. Check Australian-specific requirements
4. Compare at least 3 providers
5. Summarise with recommendation + rationale

### For Regulatory Questions
1. Check ATO, ASIC, ACNC official sources first
2. Cross-reference with professional guidance (CPA, tax institutes)
3. Note any recent changes or upcoming deadlines
4. Flag areas that need accountant confirmation
5. Always include "accountant to confirm" disclaimer for tax advice

### For Cost Estimates
1. Get current published pricing where available
