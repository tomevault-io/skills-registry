# Supabase Deployment

Deploy database migrations safely with idempotent SQL and multi-tenant isolation.

## When to Use
- Creating new database migrations
- Deploying schema changes to production
- Troubleshooting migration issues
- Setting up new environments

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Create migration
npx supabase migration new your_change_description

# 2. Write idempotent SQL (see refs/migration-patterns.md)

# 3. Test locally
npx supabase db reset

# 4. Generate types
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/lib/database/types/database-generated.ts

# 5. Deploy to production
npx supabase db push
```
