# The Composable Architecture (TCA)

## Overview

Use this skill for authoritative guidance on TCA 1.23+. Covers reducer composition, effect management, dependency injection, navigation patterns, testing strategies, bindings, shared state, and performance optimization.

## Agent behavior contract (follow these rules)

1. Always use the `@Reducer` macro — never hand-write `Reducer` conformances.
2. Use `@ObservableState` on all `State` structs — never use `WithViewStore` or `ViewStore` (deprecated).
3. Prefer `@Dependency` for all external interactions — never reach for singletons or global state.
4. Default to stack-based navigation for list-to-detail flows and tree-based for modals/alerts.
5. Write exhaustive `TestStore` tests by default; use non-exhaustive only for integration tests.
6. Keep `Reduce` body lightweight — offload async/CPU work to `.run` effects.
7. Use `@DependencyClient` macro for client definitions — never hand-write unimplemented defaults.
8. Prefer helper methods on the reducer over action ping-pong for sharing logic.
9. Always use the latest non-deprecated TCA APIs for the version in use. Check the project's resolved TCA version and avoid any API marked `@available(*, deprecated, ...)`. In particular, never use `@Reducer(state:action:)` — use extensions for conformances instead.

## First 60 seconds (triage template)

- Clarify the goal: new feature, navigation, testing, debugging, performance, or review.
- Collect minimal facts:
  - TCA version (1.23+ assumed)
  - Swift version and concurrency mode
  - Whether using stack-based or tree-based navigation
  - Whether the issue involves effects, state, or view integration
- Branch quickly:
  - new feature -> reducers + effects + dependencies
  - navigation issues -> navigation reference
  - test failures -> testing reference
  - performance -> performance reference
  - form/binding heavy -> bindings reference
  - cross-feature state -> shared state reference

## Common pitfalls -> next best move

- Action ping-pong between parent/child for shared logic -> extract helper method on reducer.
- `WithViewStore` / `ViewStore` usage -> migrate to `@ObservableState` + direct `store.property` access.
- Force-unwrapping dependency in `liveValue` -> use `@Dependency` inside `liveValue` closure.
- Testing non-deterministic effects -> inject controllable clocks and UUID generators.
- Navigation state not updating -> verify `.ifLet` / `.forEach` wiring in reducer body.
- Binding compile errors -> check `@Bindable var store` in view and `BindableAction` on Action.
- Shared state not syncing -> verify `@Shared` reference passing with `$` prefix.

## Verification checklist

- Confirm `@Reducer` macro is applied to all reducer structs.
- Confirm `@ObservableState` is on all State types.
- Confirm all external dependencies use `@Dependency`.
- Confirm navigation uses `.ifLet` (tree) or `.forEach` (stack) in reducer body.
- Confirm tests use `TestStore` with proper dependency overrides.
- Confirm effects capture state values, not `state` itself (e.g., `[id = state.id]`).
- Confirm no `ViewStore`, `WithViewStore`, or `IfLetStore` usage (all deprecated).
