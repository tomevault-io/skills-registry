description: Architecture and coding rules for long-running Java MicroProfile / Jakarta EE server applications — BCE layering, business components (BC), JAX-RS resources, CDI, JSON-P, testing (unit/integration/system), and Maven project structure. Use when creating, generating, scaffolding, writing, or reviewing code, resources, entities, boundaries, or business components in MicroProfile server projects. Not for serverless deployments. Use when this capability is needed.

## Java Version & Syntax
- use Java 25 with modern syntax (var, pattern matching, records, text blocks)
- prefer dependencies in this order: Java SE, MicroProfile, Jakarta EE
- use Java SE APIs over writing custom code
- prefer the most specific Java SE type for the domain
- prefer unchecked over checked exceptions; never throw generic exceptions like java.lang.Exception
- throw RuntimeException subclasses, not directly; inherit from WebApplicationException in JAX-RS projects
- consider using Java records instead of classes with final fields
- prefer factory methods in records over passing null in constructors

## Logging
- use java.lang.System.Logger instead of System.out statements
- never use java.util.logging.Logger
- Logger fields must be named LOGGER (uppercase) and marked as static final

## BCE/ECB Architecture
- structure code using the Boundary Control Entity (BCE/ECB) pattern
- package structure: [ORGANIZATION_NAME].[PROJECT_NAME].[COMPONENT_NAME].[boundary|control|entity]
- top level package reflects the application responsibility or name
- business components are children of top level package, named after their responsibilities
- boundary, control, entity packages are only allowed in business components
- classes with cross-cutting functionality are located in the root application package
- not every BCE component needs a dedicated boundary package; control package contents can be accessed directly
- do not explain the BCE pattern in documentation

## Package Naming
- create application level package with name derived from maven project or context
- name packages after their domain responsibilities
- create package-info.java for top level packages with JavaDoc documenting design decisions and responsibilities (not contents)
- document only domain-specific packages with package-info.java where the purpose is not self-evident

## Boundary Layer
- keep coarse-grained classes in the boundary package
- place facades in the boundary package
- health checks must be placed in the boundary package
- @Transactional is only allowed in boundary layer
- if there is no Boundary stereotype, use ApplicationScope instead

## Control Layer
- implement procedural business logic in the control package
- prefer interfaces with static methods over classes for stateless/procedural logic
- in utility interfaces prefer static over default methods

## Entity Layer
- maintain domain objects, data classes, and entities in the entity package
- entities maintain state and corresponding behavior
- model value objects as enums

## Class Naming Conventions
- name classes after their responsibilities
- avoid meaningless suffixes: *Impl, *Service, *Manager, *Creator
- class names must not end with "Control"
- only use "Resource" suffix for JAX-RS classes
- only use "Factory" suffix for actual GoF Factory pattern
- only use "Builder" suffix for classes with typical builder structure (method chaining)

## Visibility & Modifiers
- avoid private visibility; prefer package-private (default) visibility
- avoid "private static" methods; prefer default visibility
- do not use final for fields (exception: static final for LOGGER)
- do not use constructor injection

## Interfaces & Classes
- only use interfaces with multiple implementations or for strategy pattern
- do not create interfaces with abstract methods implemented by a single class; use classes directly
- create multiple classes only if it decreases complexity and increases readability

## Method Naming & Design
- avoid "getter" methods starting with "get"; prefer record convention (e.g., configuration() not getConfiguration())
- keep methods short and testable
- create well-named methods for coarse-grained, cohesive, self-contained logic
- if a lambda requires multiple statements or braces {}, extract it into a well-named helper method
- do not create multiline lambda expressions; use method references instead
- prefer extracting inline predicates into explaining methods and use method references (e.g., `.filter(this::isSkillFile)` over `.filter(p -> p.endsWith("SKILL.md"))`)
- complex `.filter()` with multiple `&&`/`||` conditions split into chained `.filter()` calls 
- extract repeated calculations or string concatenations into helper methods (DRY principle)
- do not create empty delegates which just call methods without added value

## Stream & Collections
- prefer java.util.stream.Stream API over for loops
- avoid forEach; prefer Stream methods
- prefer Stream.of to Arrays.stream
- prefer toList() to .collect(Collectors.toList())
- prefer List.of over String[] or new ArrayList<>()
- avoid creating unnecessary intermediate collections when streaming arrays
- prefer variable declaration over lengthy method chaining

## Code Style
- prefer multiple simpler lines to one more complex line
- prefer multiline Strings (text blocks) over String concatenations
- prefer imports over fully qualified class names
- use "this" to reference instance fields
- remove unused imports
- extract variables to eliminate duplication
- prefer enums over plain Strings for finite, well-defined values
- reuse enum constants as values if possible; enum constants do not have to follow naming conventions
- prefer try-with-resources over explicitly closing resources

## Simplicity Principles
- keep the design KISS and YAGNI
- always implement the simplest possible solution
- write simple code first; ask before implementing enhancements or optional features
- never over-engineer; ask about adding optional features or extension points
- create new components with minimal business logic and essential fields only

## Exceptions
- create custom exceptions only if it significantly improves robustness or maintainability
- use explicit exceptions like BadRequestException for Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST
- always use WebApplicationException in compact constructors in JAX-RS projects
- do not re-throw exceptions with "throw e" without adding value

## JavaDoc
- do not write obvious JavaDoc comments that rephrase code
- document the intentions and the "why", not implementation details
- either describe the "why" or do not comment at all
- follow links in JavaDoc to external specifications and use them for code generation
- use popular, also funny, technical terms from the Java SE, MicroProfile and Jakarta EE ecosystems as examples in unit tests and javadoc

## README Guidelines
- write brief, 'to the point' README.md files for advanced developers
- use precise and concise language; avoid generic adjectives like "simple", "lightweight"
- do not include detailed project structure (file/folder listings); high-level module descriptions are acceptable
- never list REST resources in READMEs
- if modules are listed, provide links
- do not use "Orchestrates" term; use more specific alternatives

## Testing
- unit test methods must not start with "test" or "should"
- avoid writing repetitive or trivial unit tests; keep only essential tests verifying core functionality
- do not write tests for implementations that cannot fail (enums, records, getters/setters)
- create minimalistic tests first
- generate at most three tests per class under test (applies separately to UTs, ITs, and STs)
- use AssertJ library instead of JUnit assertions
- the presence of isEqualTo assertion makes less specific checks (startsWith, isNotNull) obsolete
- do not use private visibility in tests

## Integration Tests
- integration tests end with IT suffix and are executed by the failsafe maven plugin (no configuration necessary)

## System Tests (ST)
- system tests are created in a dedicated Maven module ending with "-st"
- use microprofile-rest-client for testing JAX-RS resources
- REST client interfaces: src/main/java of the -st module
- test classes: src/test/java of the -st module
- name client interfaces after the resource with "Client" suffix (e.g., GreetingsResource -> GreetingsResourceClient)
- RegisterRestClient configKey: "service_uri"
- STs end with "IT" suffix
- do not use RestAssured. Write e2e test in the -st module
- execute system tests after every major change to the service module
- in PoC mode (user-activated), system test execution is skipped

## JAX-RS
- resources should be named in plural (e.g., SpeakersResource not SpeakerResource)
- @Consumes and @Produces should be declared on class-level
- do not implement business logic in JAX-RS resources; delegate instead
- prefer returning JAX-RS Response over JsonObject in resources
- do not create new "@RegisterRestClient(configKey," - reuse existing

## JSON Serialization (JSON-P)
- prefer JSON-P over JSON-B
- record entities should ship with toJSON method returning a JSON-P object
- always map JSON-P in the boundary to entities
- create record entities from JSON-P JsonObject in static method: fromJSON(JsonObject json)

## HTTP Client
- prefer synchronous HTTPClient APIs
- use asynchronous Http APIs (HttpClient.sendAsync) only if explicitly requested

## Project Management
- always ask before changing pom.xml
- on opening existing projects, load AGENTS.md (if present) before making changes
- do not create or change any files on opening existing projects; stop after initialization and wait for instructions
- do not generate code initially in an empty project
- Maven pom.xml must not be created for Java 25 CLI applications
- never use quarkus-hibernate-validator
- create metrics and observability features with OTEL / opentelemetry
