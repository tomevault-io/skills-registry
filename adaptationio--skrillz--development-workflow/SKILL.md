# Development Workflow

## Overview

development-workflow provides a complete end-to-end process for developing Claude Code skills from concept to production. It orchestrates five component skills (skill-researcher, planning-architect, task-development, prompt-builder, todo-management) into a cohesive workflow that ensures systematic, research-driven, high-quality skill development.

**Purpose**: Systematic skill development using proven best practices

**Pattern**: Workflow-based (5-step sequential process with one optional step)

**Key Benefit**: Transforms ad-hoc skill building into a repeatable, quality-assured process

**Component Skills**:
1. skill-researcher: Multi-source research (Web, GitHub, MCP, docs)
2. planning-architect: Skill architecture and structure design
3. task-development: Detailed task breakdown with estimates (optional)
4. prompt-builder: High-quality prompt creation for operations
5. todo-management: Real-time progress tracking

## When to Use

Use development-workflow when:
- Building a new Claude Code skill from scratch
- Want systematic, research-driven approach
- Need to ensure quality through structured process
- Building complex skills (workflow-based, many operations)
- Want to leverage the complete skill toolkit
- Following bootstrap strategy for efficiency

## Prerequisites

Before starting this workflow:
- **Clear objective**: Know what skill you want to build and why
- **Component skills available**: All 5 skills installed and accessible
- **Time allocated**: 4-8 hours for workflow (research through task list)
- **Implementation time**: Additional time to actually build the skill (varies by complexity)
- **Research goal**: Specific domain or problem to research

## Skill Development Workflow

### Step 1: Research Domain & Patterns

Research the domain comprehensively to discover patterns, best practices, examples, and validate approaches before designing the skill.

**Purpose**: Ground skill in proven patterns and community knowledge

**Component Skill**: skill-researcher

**Integration Method**: Guided execution (user invokes skill-researcher with specific goals)

**When to Use**: Always (never skip research)

**Inputs**:
- Skill objective: [What the skill should accomplish]
- Research questions:
  - What patterns exist for this type of skill?
  - What are community best practices?
  - What examples are available?
  - What MCP servers exist (if integration needed)?
  - What official documentation exists?

**Process**:

1. **Define Research Scope**:
   ```markdown
   Research Goal: [Skill domain/topic]

   Questions to Answer:
   - What organizational patterns are used?
   - What are best practices for [domain]?
   - What code/structure examples exist?
   - What official specifications exist?
   - What MCP integrations are available?
   ```

2. **Execute Research Operations**:

   Invoke skill-researcher and execute all relevant operations:

   **Operation 1: Web Search Research**
   - Query: "[domain] best practices 2025"
   - Query: "Claude Code [skill type] patterns"
   - Sources: Minimum 3-5 credible sources
   - Document findings: web-research.md

   **Operation 2: GitHub Repository Research** (if code patterns needed)
   - Search: [domain] examples, official repositories
   - Analyze: 3-5 repositories for patterns
   - Extract: Code structures, organizational patterns
   - Document findings: github-patterns.md

   **Operation 3: Documentation Research**
   - Find: Official Claude Code documentation
   - Find: Domain-specific official docs
   - Extract: Specifications, requirements, best practices
   - Document findings: official-docs.md

   **Operation 4: MCP Server Research** (if integration needed)
   - Search: MCP servers for [domain]
   - Evaluate: Capabilities, maturity, integration complexity
   - Document findings: mcp-options.md

   **Operation 5: Synthesize Research Findings**
   - Organize: All findings by theme
   - Identify: Patterns appearing across 3+ sources
   - Resolve: Any conflicts between sources
   - Create: research-synthesis.md with actionable insights

3. **Review Synthesis**:
   - Read complete synthesis document
   - Note key patterns identified
   - Note best practices found
   - Note examples to reference
   - Identify any gaps requiring additional research

4. **Extract Key Insights**:
   ```markdown
   # Key Insights from Research

   ## Patterns Identified:
   1. [Pattern 1]: Appears in [X] sources
   2. [Pattern 2]: Appears in [Y] sources

   ## Best Practices:
   1. [Practice 1] - from [sources]
   2. [Practice 2] - from [sources]

   ## Examples to Reference:
   - [Example 1]: [Source and what it demonstrates]
   - [Example 2]: [Source and what it demonstrates]

   ## Recommendations:
   1. [Actionable recommendation based on research]
   2. [Actionable recommendation based on research]
   ```

**Outputs**:
- research-synthesis.md: Complete multi-source synthesis
- Key patterns identified (minimum 2)
- Best practices extracted (minimum 3)
- Examples captured (minimum 3)
- Actionable recommendations (minimum 2)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Minimum 3-5 sources consulted
- [ ] Patterns identified across multiple sources
- [ ] Best practices documented with sources
- [ ] Examples captured with references
- [ ] Synthesis document complete
- [ ] Recommendations are specific and actionable

**Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours

**Common Issues**:
- **Issue**: Insufficient sources found
  - **Solution**: Broaden search terms, try related domains, check official docs
- **Issue**: No clear patterns emerge
  - **Solution**: Look at higher-level patterns (workflow vs task-based), check similar skills
- **Issue**: Conflicting information
  - **Solution**: Prioritize official docs, look for consensus (3+ sources agreeing)

**Next**: Proceed to Step 2 with research findings

---

### Step 2: Plan Skill Architecture

Design the skill's structure, scope, and approach based on research findings. Define what goes where and how the skill will be organized.

**Purpose**: Create clear architectural plan before implementation

**Component Skill**: planning-architect

**Integration Method**: Guided execution

**When to Use**: Always (planning is essential)

**Inputs**:
- research-synthesis.md (from Step 1)
- Skill objective (what it should accomplish)
- Target users (who will use it)
- Success criteria (what "done" looks like)

**Process**:

1. **Prepare Planning Inputs**:
   ```markdown
   Skill Objective: [Clear statement of what skill does]
   Target Users: [Who will use this - developers, domain experts, etc.]
   Success Criteria: [What makes this skill successful]
   Research Findings: [Key patterns and practices from Step 1]
   ```

2. **Invoke planning-architect Workflow**:

   Execute all 5 steps of planning-architect:

   **Step 1: Understand Requirements**
   - Review research findings
   - Clarify skill objective
   - Identify target users and their needs
   - Define success criteria
   - Note constraints (time, complexity, dependencies)

   **Step 2: Choose Organizational Pattern**
   - Evaluate patterns: Workflow vs Task-based vs Reference vs Capabilities
   - Consider research findings (what patterns did you see?)
   - Choose pattern with rationale
   - Document decision

   Example decision:
   ```markdown
   Pattern: Workflow-based
   Rationale: Sequential steps with clear dependencies (research found 80% of similar skills use workflow pattern)
   ```

   **Step 3: Design Structure**
   - Design SKILL.md sections (Overview, When to Use, Steps/Operations)
   - Plan references/ directory (what detailed guides needed?)
   - Plan scripts/ directory (what automation needed?)
   - Create file structure outline

   **Step 4: Plan Content**
   - For each workflow step or task operation:
     - Define purpose
     - List inputs needed
     - Describe process
     - Specify outputs
     - Define validation criteria
   - Plan reference file contents
   - Plan script functionality

   **Step 5: Validate Plan**
   - Check completeness (all sections planned?)
   - Check coherence (does structure make sense?)
   - Check feasibility (can it be built?)
   - Review against research findings
   - Confirm success criteria addressed

3. **Create Planning Documents**:

   Generate these artifacts:

   **skill-plan.md**: Complete architecture
   ```markdown
   # Skill Plan: [Name]

   ## Pattern: [Chosen pattern]
   Rationale: [Why this pattern]

   ## Structure:
   - SKILL.md: [Sections planned]
   - references/: [Files planned]
   - scripts/: [Scripts planned]

   ## Content Plan:
   [For each section, what it contains]

   ## Validation: [Plan review results]
   ```

   **structure-outline.md**: Visual file structure
   ```
   [skill-name]/
   ├── SKILL.md
   ├── references/
   │   ├── [reference-1].md
   │   └── [reference-2].md
   ├── scripts/
   │   └── [script-1].py
   └── README.md
   ```

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Read complete plan
   - Verify against research findings
   - Check for gaps or inconsistencies
   - Adjust as needed before proceeding

**Outputs**:
- skill-plan.md: Complete skill architecture and approach
- structure-outline.md: File structure with all planned files
- content-specifications.md: What each section/file will contain
- Pattern choice documented with rationale

**Validation**:
- [ ] Pattern chosen (workflow/task/reference/capabilities) with rationale
- [ ] File structure designed (SKILL.md + references + scripts)
- [ ] All sections planned with content specifications
- [ ] Plan aligns with research findings
- [ ] Plan addresses success criteria
- [ ] Plan validated for completeness and feasibility

**Time Estimate**: 1-1.5 hours

**Common Issues**:
- **Issue**: Can't decide between patterns
  - **Solution**: Check research - what pattern did similar skills use? Default to workflow for sequential processes, task-based for independent operations
- **Issue**: Uncertain about what references to create
  - **Solution**: References for any topic needing >500 words of detail
- **Issue**: Not sure if scripts needed
  - **Solution**: Scripts for automation, validation, or user convenience - often optional

**Next**: Proceed to Step 3 (optional) or Step 4

---

### Step 3: Design Task Breakdown (Optional)

Break down skill implementation into detailed tasks with estimates, dependencies, and optimal sequencing. This step is optional but recommended for complex skills.

**Purpose**: Create detailed, actionable task list for systematic implementation

**Component Skill**: task-development

**Integration Method**: Guided execution

**When to Use**:
- Complex skills (>20 tasks estimated)
- Team coordination needed
- Tight timeline/budget
- Want detailed planning

**When to Skip**:
- Simple skills (<10 tasks estimated)
- Solo development with flexible timeline
- Prefer lightweight planning

**Decision Criteria**:
```
Use task-development if ANY of:
- Workflow-based skill with 5+ steps
- Each step needs 500+ words of content
- Multiple reference files (3+)
- Scripts with significant logic
- Unfamiliar domain (learning curve)

Skip task-development if ALL of:
- Task-based skill with <8 operations
- Familiar domain
- Solo developer
- Flexible timeline
```

**Inputs**:
- skill-plan.md (from Step 2)
- Complexity assessment (simple/medium/complex)

**Process**:

1. **Assess Complexity**:
   ```markdown
   Skill: [Name]
   Pattern: [workflow/task/etc]

   Estimated Components:
   - SKILL.md sections: [count]
   - Reference files: [count]
   - Scripts: [count]
   - Total estimated tasks: [rough guess]

   Decision: [Use task-development: YES/NO]
   Rationale: [Why]
   ```

2. **If Using task-development, Execute Workflow**:

   Invoke task-development and execute all 6 steps:

   **Step 1: Analyze Skill Plan**
   - Review complete skill plan
   - Identify major components (SKILL.md, each reference, each script)
   - Note complexity areas
   - Consider dependencies

   **Step 2: Identify Major Components**
   - List all deliverables:
     - SKILL.md with all sections
     - Each reference file
     - Each script file
     - README.md
     - Any examples or templates

   **Step 3: Break Down Components into Tasks**
   - For each component, create specific tasks
   - Example for SKILL.md:
     - Task 1: YAML frontmatter (15 min)
     - Task 2: Overview section (30 min)
     - Task 3: Step 1 detailed instructions (1h)
     - Task 4: Step 2 detailed instructions (1h)
     - ... etc
   - Be specific: "Write X" not "Work on X"

   **Step 4: Estimate Each Task**
   - Use historical data if available (how long similar tasks took)
   - Use comparison (similar to Task X which took Y)
   - Use three-point: (optimistic + 4×most-likely + pessimistic) / 6
   - Document estimates with method used

   **Step 5: Identify Dependencies**
   - For each task, what must complete first?
   - Hard dependencies (blocking): "Task 5 MUST wait for Task 2"
   - Soft dependencies (preferred): "Task 7 easier after Task 4"
   - Document rationale for each dependency

   **Step 6: Sequence Tasks Optimally**
   - Create execution sequence
   - Identify critical path (longest chain of dependencies)
   - Note parallel opportunities (tasks that can run simultaneously)
   - Optimize schedule

3. **Create Task List Document**:
   ```markdown
   # Task List: [Skill Name]

   Total Tasks: [count]
   Estimated Time: [range]
   Critical Path: [time]

   ## Tasks:

   1. Create directory structure (15 min) - No dependencies
   2. SKILL.md: YAML frontmatter (15 min) - Depends on: 1
   3. SKILL.md: Overview (30 min) - Depends on: 2
   ...

   ## Dependencies:
   [Detailed dependency list with rationale]

   ## Critical Path:
   [Tasks on critical path]

   ## Parallel Opportunities:
   [Tasks that can run simultaneously]
   ```

4. **Validate Task List**:
   - Check: All components from plan have tasks
   - Check: Estimates sum to reasonable total
   - Check: Dependencies make sense
   - Check: Critical path identified

**Outputs** (if used):
- task-list.md: Complete task breakdown with estimates
- dependencies.md: Task dependencies and critical path
- schedule.md: Optimal task sequence

**Validation** (if used):
- [ ] All components broken into specific tasks
- [ ] Each task has time estimate
- [ ] Dependencies identified with rationale
- [ ] Critical path calculated
- [ ] Parallel opportunities noted
- [ ] Total time estimate reasonable

**Time Estimate**: 30-60 minutes (if used)

**Alternative** (if skipped):
Create simple task checklist:
```markdown
## Simple Task List:

- [ ] Create directory structure
- [ ] Build SKILL.md
- [ ] Build reference files (X files)
- [ ] Build scripts (if needed)
- [ ] Build README.md
- [ ] Validate skill
```

**Next**: Proceed to Step 4

### Step 4: Create High-Quality Prompts

Build effective prompts for each workflow step or task operation in the skill. Use prompt-builder to ensure quality, clarity, and consistency.

**Purpose**: Create prompts that produce reliable, high-quality results

**Component Skill**: prompt-builder

**Integration Method**: Guided execution (invoke for each prompt needed)

**When to Use**: Always (quality prompts are critical)

**Inputs**:
- skill-plan.md (workflow steps or operations defined)
- task-list.md (if available, shows what needs prompts)
- Number of prompts needed: [One per workflow step or task operation]

**Process**:

1. **Identify Prompts Needed**:

   From skill plan, list each workflow step or task operation:
   ```markdown
   Prompts Needed:

   Workflow-based skill:
   - Prompt 1: Step 1 instructions
   - Prompt 2: Step 2 instructions
   - Prompt 3: Step 3 instructions
   ...

   Task-based skill:
   - Prompt 1: Operation 1 instructions
   - Prompt 2: Operation 2 instructions
   ...
   ```

2. **For Each Prompt, Execute prompt-builder Workflow**:

   Invoke prompt-builder for each prompt (can do multiple in sequence):

   **Step 1: Understand Context**
   - Goal: What should this prompt accomplish?
   - Audience: Claude executing the skill
   - Situation: Position in workflow/skill
   - Constraints: Format, length, style
   - Success: What does good execution look like?

   **Step 2: Define Task Clearly**
   - Action verb: Specific action (Invoke, Execute, Analyze, Create...)
   - Object: What's being acted on
   - Constraints: Explicit requirements (format, length, inclusions)
   - Quality criteria: Measurable success indicators
   - Context references: What information to use

   **Step 3: Structure Prompt**
   - Choose template (workflow step vs task operation)
   - Organize sections:
     - Purpose statement
     - Component skill used (if any)
     - Inputs
     - Process (numbered steps)
     - Outputs
     - Validation checklist
   - Format consistently

   **Step 4: Add Context & Examples**
   - Background: Why this step exists
   - Examples: Good output examples
   - Boundaries: What NOT to do
   - Success patterns: What quality looks like

   **Step 5: Refine & Validate**
   - Check clarity (unambiguous?)
   - Check specificity (precise requirements?)
   - Check completeness (all info provided?)
   - Score quality dimensions (target: all ≥4)
   - Iterate if needed

3. **Collect and Review All Prompts**:
   ```markdown
   # Prompt Collection: [Skill Name]

   ## Step 1 Prompt:
   [Complete prompt text]
   Quality Score: [Clarity: 4.5, Specificity: 4.0, ...]

   ## Step 2 Prompt:
   [Complete prompt text]
   Quality Score: [Clarity: 5.0, Specificity: 4.5, ...]

   ...
   ```

4. **Check Consistency**:
   - Review all prompts together
   - Check consistent terminology
   - Check consistent style
   - Check logical flow between prompts
   - Adjust for consistency

**Outputs**:
- prompts-collection.md: All prompts for workflow steps/operations
- quality-scores.md: Validation scores for each prompt (all should be ≥4)
- Prompts ready to integrate into SKILL.md

**Validation**:
- [ ] One prompt per workflow step/operation
- [ ] All prompts score ≥4 on quality dimensions (clarity, specificity, completeness, actionability, reliability)
- [ ] Prompts use consistent terminology
- [ ] Prompts use consistent style and format
- [ ] Examples provided where helpful
- [ ] Validation criteria included in each prompt

**Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours (depends on number of prompts)

**Common Issues**:
- **Issue**: Prompt too vague
  - **Solution**: Add specific numbers, formats, examples
- **Issue**: Prompt validation scores <4
  - **Solution**: Add context, examples, specific criteria - iterate with prompt-builder
- **Issue**: Inconsistent terminology across prompts
  - **Solution**: Define key terms once, use consistently

**Next**: Proceed to Step 5

### Step 5: Track Implementation Progress

Monitor task completion, identify blockers, maintain momentum throughout skill implementation. Use todo-management continuously from start to completion.

**Purpose**: Systematic progress tracking ensures completion and identifies issues early

**Component Skill**: todo-management

**Integration Method**: Continuous execution (used throughout implementation phase)

**When to Use**: Always (throughout implementation)

**Inputs**:
- task-list.md (from Step 3) OR
- Simple task list (if Step 3 skipped)

**Process**:

1. **Initialize Todo List**:

   **If task-list.md exists** (from Step 3):
   ```bash
   python task-development/scripts/break-down-tasks.py --input task-list.md --output todos.md
   # Or use todo-management script:
   python todo-management/scripts/update-todos.py --init task-list.md [skill-name]
   ```

   **If simple task list** (Step 3 skipped):
   Create todos.md manually:
   ```markdown
   # Todo List: [Skill Name]

   Started: [date]
   Estimate: [time range]

   ⬜ 1. Create directory structure (15 min)
   ⬜ 2. Build SKILL.md: YAML frontmatter (15 min)
   ⬜ 3. Build SKILL.md: Overview (30 min)
   ⬜ 4. Build SKILL.md: Step 1 (1h)
   ...

   Progress: 0/X tasks (0%)
   ```

2. **Throughout Implementation, Use Todo Management Operations**:

   **Operation 1: Start Task**
   - When beginning work: Mark task as in_progress (🔄)
   - RULE: Only ONE task in_progress at a time
   - Add start timestamp
   ```bash
   python todo-management/scripts/update-todos.py --start [task-number]
   ```

   **Operation 2: Complete Task**
   - When task finished and verified: Mark as completed (✅)
   - Add completion timestamp
   - Record actual time (compare to estimate)
   ```bash
   python todo-management/scripts/update-todos.py --complete [task-number] --actual "[time]"
   ```

   **Operation 3: Report Progress**
   - Generate status report (end of session, before meetings)
   ```bash
   python todo-management/scripts/update-todos.py --report
   ```

   **Operation 4: Identify Blockers**
   - If task blocked: Mark as blocked (🚫) with reason
   - Address blocker within 1 day
   ```bash
   python todo-management/scripts/update-todos.py --block [task-number] --reason "[specific blocker]"
   ```

   **Operation 5: Update Estimates**
   - As you work: Note actual times vs estimates
   - Learn for future estimates
   - Adjust remaining task estimates if needed

   **Operation 6: Handle Task Changes**
   - Add new tasks discovered during implementation
   - Mark obsolete tasks as obsolete (⊗)
   - Update task descriptions if needed

   **Operation 7: Maintain Momentum**
   - Ensure progress every session (≥1 task completed)
   - Address blockers quickly
   - Celebrate completions

3. **Monitor Progress Continuously**:
   ```markdown
   # Progress Check (daily/per session)

   ✅ Completed: [count]
   🔄 In Progress: [count] (should be 1)
   ⬜ Pending: [count]
   🚫 Blocked: [count] (should be 0 or addressing)

   Percentage: [completed/total × 100]%
   Velocity: [tasks per day/session]
   Blockers: [list any, with resolution plan]
   Next Session: [next task to start]
   ```

4. **Continue Until All Tasks Complete**:
   - Work through task list systematically
   - Mark tasks complete immediately (don't batch)
   - Keep only ONE task in_progress
   - Address blockers same-day
   - Generate final completion summary

**Outputs**:
- todos.md: Real-time task tracking (updated continuously)
- progress-reports/: Status reports generated
- completion-summary.md: Final summary with actual times vs estimates

**Validation**:
- [ ] Todo list initialized from task list
- [ ] Tasks updated in real-time (not batched)
- [ ] Only ONE task in_progress at any time
- [ ] Blockers identified and addressed
- [ ] Progress reports generated regularly
- [ ] Actual times recorded vs estimates
- [ ] All tasks eventually completed

**Time Estimate**: Continuous (throughout implementation, which varies by skill complexity)

**Common Issues**:
- **Issue**: Multiple tasks in_progress
  - **Solution**: Complete current task before starting next (focus)
- **Issue**: Blocker sitting for days
  - **Solution**: Address within 1 day, escalate if can't resolve
- **Issue**: Estimates wildly off
  - **Solution**: Learning opportunity - note for future, adjust remaining estimates
- **Issue**: Losing momentum (no completions)
  - **Solution**: Break large tasks smaller, find quick wins, identify blockers

**Next**: Implementation complete when all tasks done

---

## Post-Workflow: Implementation Phase

After completing the 5-step workflow, you have:
- ✅ Research findings with patterns and best practices
- ✅ Complete skill plan with structure
- ✅ Task list with estimates (or simple checklist)
- ✅ High-quality prompts for all steps/operations
- ✅ Progress tracking system initialized

**Now**: Implement the skill using the plan, prompts, and task list

**During Implementation**:
- Follow the task list order
- Use prompts created in Step 4
- Track progress with Step 5 (todo-management)
- Reference research findings (Step 1) as needed
- Refer to skill plan (Step 2) for structure

**After Implementation**:
- Validate skill structure (YAML, files, format)
- Test skill execution (dry run, actual use)
- Review against research best practices
- Iterate and refine as needed

## Best Practices

### Research-Driven Development

**1. Never Skip Research** (Step 1)
- Research grounds skill in proven patterns
- Prevents reinventing solutions
- Validates approach early
- Discovers existing MCP integrations

**2. Multi-Source Validation**
- Minimum 3-5 sources
- Cross-reference findings
- Look for consensus (3+ sources agreeing)
- Prioritize official documentation

**3. Pattern Recognition**
- Note what appears multiple times
- This is consensus pattern
- Document source consensus
- Apply to your skill

### Planning Before Building

**1. Complete Planning Before Implementation** (Step 2)
- Prevents mid-implementation rework
- Ensures coherent structure
- Identifies gaps early
- Provides roadmap

**2. Choose Pattern Deliberately**
- Workflow: Sequential dependencies
- Task-based: Independent operations
- Reference: Standards/guidelines
- Capabilities: Multiple integrated features
- Document rationale

**3. Plan Content, Not Just Structure**
- Don't just list sections
- Specify what each contains
- Identify examples needed
- Note validation criteria

### Task Management

**1. Use Task Breakdown for Complex Skills** (Step 3)
- If >20 tasks: Use task-development
- If <10 tasks: Simple checklist fine
- When in doubt: Use full task breakdown

**2. Estimate Realistically**
- Use historical data when available
- Three-point estimation for uncertainty
- Track actuals to improve future estimates

**3. Manage Dependencies**
- Identify critical path
- Find parallel opportunities
- Don't let dependencies block unnecessarily

### Prompt Quality

**1. Invest Time in Prompts** (Step 4)
- Quality prompts = quality skill
- All prompts should score ≥4
- Consistency across prompts matters
- Examples clarify intent

**2. Validate Each Prompt**
- Use prompt-builder validation
- Check all 5 dimensions
- Iterate until quality threshold met
- Don't skip this step

**3. Include Validation Criteria**
- Every prompt needs validation
- Checkboxes for verification
- Measurable, objective criteria
- Enables self-assessment

### Progress Tracking

**1. Track Continuously** (Step 5)
- Update immediately (don't batch)
- One task in_progress rule
- Complete before moving to next
- Address blockers same-day

**2. Maintain Momentum**
- ≥1 task completed per session
- Celebrate completions
- Break large tasks if stuck
- Keep progressing

**3. Learn from Actuals**
- Record actual time vs estimate
- Note what took longer/shorter
- Improve future estimates
- Identify efficiency opportunities

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Skipping Research

**Problem**: Building without understanding existing patterns
- Reinvents solutions
- Misses best practices
- Lower quality result

**Fix**: Always complete Step 1, minimum 3-5 sources

### Mistake 2: Starting Implementation Without Plan

**Problem**: Ad-hoc structure, rework needed
- Incoherent organization
- Missing components discovered late
- Wasted effort

**Fix**: Complete Step 2 planning before writing any code/content

### Mistake 3: Poor Quality Prompts

**Problem**: First-draft prompts without validation
- Vague instructions
- Inconsistent results
- Users confused

**Fix**: Use Step 4 prompt-builder, ensure all ≥4 quality score

### Mistake 4: No Progress Tracking

**Problem**: Losing momentum, incomplete tasks
- Work feels endless
- Blockers unaddressed
- Don't know when done

**Fix**: Use Step 5 todo-management from start to finish

### Mistake 5: Skipping Optional Step When Needed

**Problem**: Complex skill without task breakdown
- Overwhelmed by complexity
- Missing dependencies
- Inefficient execution

**Fix**: Use Step 3 for complex skills (>20 tasks, unfamiliar domain, team coordination)

### Mistake 6: Multiple Tasks In Progress

**Problem**: Context switching, nothing completing
- Divided attention
- Tasks incomplete
- Momentum lost

**Fix**: ONE task in_progress rule, complete before next

- Used multiple times (once per prompt)
- Depends on plan (knows what prompts needed)
- Produces prompts for implementation
- Time: 1-2 hours

**todo-management** (Step 5):
- Used continuously during implementation
- Depends on task list (from Step 3 or simple list)
- Tracks progress until complete
- Time: Ongoing throughout implementation

### Using Skills Individually

All component skills work independently outside this workflow:
- skill-researcher: Any research need
- planning-architect: Planning any project
- task-development: Breaking down any work
- prompt-builder: Creating any prompt
- todo-management: Tracking any task list

This workflow orchestrates them for complete skill development.

### Workflow Variations

**Fast Track** (simple skills):
- Step 1: Research (required)
- Step 2: Planning (required)
- Step 3: Skip task-development, use simple checklist
- Step 4: Prompt building (required)
- Step 5: Progress tracking (required)
- Time: ~3-4 hours + implementation

**Full Process** (complex skills):
- All 5 steps
- Detailed task breakdown
- Comprehensive planning
- Time: ~5-8 hours + implementation

## Quick Reference

### The 5-Step Process

1. **Research Domain**: skill-researcher (1-2h) - Always required
2. **Plan Architecture**: planning-architect (1-1.5h) - Always required
3. **Task Breakdown**: task-development (30-60m) - Optional for complex
4. **Build Prompts**: prompt-builder (1-2h) - Always required
5. **Track Progress**: todo-management (ongoing) - Always required

### Decision Points

**Use task-development?**
- Yes: Complex (>20 tasks), team work, tight timeline
- No: Simple (<10 tasks), solo, flexible timeline

### Time Budget

- **Workflow Phase**: 4-8 hours (research through task list)
- **Implementation Phase**: Varies by skill (simple: 2-3h, complex: 8-12h)
- **Total**: Simple skill ~6-10 hours, Complex skill ~15-20 hours

### Success Criteria

✅ Research complete (3+ sources, patterns identified)
✅ Plan created (structure, content, validation)
✅ Tasks defined (breakdown or checklist)
✅ Prompts built (all ≥4 quality)
✅ Progress tracked (todos updated continuously)
✅ Implementation complete (all tasks done)
✅ Skill validated (structure, function, quality)
