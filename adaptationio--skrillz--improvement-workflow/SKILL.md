name: improvement-workflow
description: Complete continuous improvement cycle orchestrating review, analysis, learning extraction, systematic updates, and validation. Sequential workflow from comprehensive review through pattern analysis and learning extraction to improvement application and re-validation. Use when continuously improving skills, applying review findings, implementing systematic enhancements, or executing complete improvement cycles. Use when this capability is needed.

# Improvement Workflow

## Overview

improvement-workflow orchestrates the complete continuous improvement cycle for Claude Code skills, transforming review findings into applied improvements and validated enhancements.

**Purpose**: End-to-end skill improvement from review through validated enhancement

**Component Skills** (5):
1. **review-multi** - Comprehensive multi-dimensional review (identify issues)
2. **analysis** - Pattern analysis across findings (understand systemic issues)
3. **best-practices-learner** - Extract learnings (capture insights)
4. **skill-updater** - Apply improvements (implement changes)
5. **skill-validator** - Validate improvements (ensure quality maintained)

**Workflow Pattern**: Sequential pipeline with feedback loop

**Result**: Systematically improved skills with validated enhancements and captured learnings

## When to Use

- Continuous improvement iterations (make good skills better)
- Applying review recommendations (systematic implementation)
- Post-deployment enhancement (v1.0 → v1.1)
- Multiple skill improvements (consistent process)
- Learning-driven development (capture and apply insights)

## Improvement Workflow

### Step 1: Comprehensive Review (review-multi)

**Purpose**: Identify improvement opportunities through multi-dimensional assessment

**Process**: Run review-multi comprehensive mode (all 5 operations)

**Outputs**:
- Overall score and grade
- Per-dimension scores
- Prioritized improvement recommendations
- Identified issues and anti-patterns

**Time**: 1.5-2.5 hours

---

### Step 2: Pattern Analysis (analysis)

**Purpose**: Understand systemic patterns in findings

**Process**: Use analysis Operation 5 (Pattern Recognition)
- Review findings from Step 1
- Identify recurring themes (if reviewing multiple skills)
- Understand root causes
- Prioritize by impact

**Outputs**:
- Pattern analysis (systemic issues vs one-offs)
- Root cause understanding
- Impact-prioritized improvements

**Time**: 45-90 minutes

---

### Step 3: Extract Learnings (best-practices-learner)

**Purpose**: Capture insights for future application

**Process**: Use best-practices-learner Operations 1-2
- Extract patterns from review findings
- Document what worked/didn't work
- Capture insights for guidelines

**Outputs**:
- Documented patterns
- Learnings log
- Insights for guideline updates

**Time**: 30-60 minutes

---

### Step 4: Apply Improvements (skill-updater)

**Purpose**: Systematically implement improvements

**Process**: Use skill-updater workflow
1. Plan updates (prioritize recommendations)
2. Backup skill
3. Apply changes (one at a time)
4. Test each change

**Outputs**:
- Updated skill with improvements applied
- Change documentation
- Version update

**Time**: 1-4 hours (varies by number of improvements)

---

### Step 5: Validate Improvements (skill-validator + review-multi)

**Purpose**: Ensure improvements effective, no regressions

**Process**:
1. Run skill-validator (ensure still passes minimum standards)
2. Re-run review-multi (compare before/after scores)
3. Validate improvements achieved goals
4. Document impact

**Outputs**:
- Validation results (pass/fail)
- Before/after score comparison
- Impact measurement
- Regression check

**Time**: 30-60 minutes

---

### Step 6: Update Guidelines (best-practices-learner)

**Purpose**: Feed learnings back into ecosystem

**Process**: Use best-practices-learner Operation 3
- Update common-patterns.md with new patterns
- Update templates if needed
- Propagate learnings to future skills

**Outputs**:
- Updated guidelines
- Improved templates
- Enhanced ecosystem knowledge

**Time**: 20-40 minutes

---

## Post-Workflow: Iteration Decision

After completing workflow:

**If Score Improved Significantly** (≥0.5 points):
- ✅ Improvements effective
- Document success
- Apply similar improvements to other skills

**If Score Improved Slightly** (<0.5 points):
- ⚠️ Minor impact
- Assess if effort worth benefit
- Consider different improvements

**If Score Unchanged or Decreased**:
- ❌ Improvements ineffective or caused regressions
- Review what went wrong
- Revert changes if regression
- Try different approach

**Iterate**:
- Can run workflow again for further improvements
- Diminishing returns after 2-3 iterations
- Focus on highest-impact improvements first

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Review Before Improve
**Practice**: Always review comprehensively before changing

**Rationale**: Understand current state fully prevents fixing wrong things

### 2. Prioritize by Impact
**Practice**: Apply high-impact improvements first

**Rationale**: Maximum benefit for effort invested

### 3. One Improvement at a Time
**Practice**: Apply and validate each change individually

**Rationale**: Prevents compounding errors, identifies what actually helped

### 4. Measure Impact
**Practice**: Compare before/after scores objectively

**Rationale**: Data-driven understanding of effectiveness

### 5. Capture Learnings
**Practice**: Document what worked for future application

**Rationale**: Learnings compound across improvements

## Quick Reference

### The 6-Step Improvement Workflow

| Step | Skill | Purpose | Time | Output |
|------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 1 | review-multi | Comprehensive review | 1.5-2.5h | Scores, recommendations |
| 2 | analysis | Pattern analysis | 45-90m | Systemic insights |
| 3 | best-practices-learner | Extract learnings | 30-60m | Documented patterns |
| 4 | skill-updater | Apply improvements | 1-4h | Updated skill |
| 5 | skill-validator + review-multi | Validate improvements | 30-60m | Impact measurement |
| 6 | best-practices-learner | Update guidelines | 20-40m | Enhanced ecosystem |

**Total Time**: 5-9 hours for complete improvement cycle

### Workflow Pattern

```
review-multi → Identify improvements
    ↓
analysis → Understand patterns
    ↓
best-practices-learner → Extract learnings
    ↓
skill-updater → Apply changes
    ↓
validate → Measure impact
    ↓
Update guidelines → Feed ecosystem
```

### Typical Improvements

- Add Quick Reference (UX)
- Enhance examples (clarity)
- Refine validation criteria (specificity)
- Add error handling (completeness)
- Improve integration docs (workflow skills)
