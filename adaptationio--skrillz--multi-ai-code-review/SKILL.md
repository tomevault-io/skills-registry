# Multi-AI Code Review

## Overview

multi-ai-code-review provides comprehensive code review using multiple AI models as specialized agents, each analyzing code from a different perspective. Based on 2024-2025 best practices for AI-assisted code review.

**Purpose**: Multi-perspective code quality assessment using AI ensemble with human oversight

**Pattern**: Task-based (5 independent review dimensions + orchestration)

**Key Principles** (validated by tri-AI research):
1. **Multi-Agent Architecture** - Specialized agents for each review dimension
2. **LLM-as-Judge Consensus** - Flag issues only when 2+ models agree
3. **Progressive Severity** - Critical → High → Medium → Low prioritization
4. **Human-in-Loop** - AI suggests, human decides
5. **Quality Gates** - Block merges for critical unresolved issues
6. **Actionable Feedback** - Every comment has What/Where/Why/How

**Quality Targets**:
- False Positive Rate: <15%
- Fix Acceptance Rate: >40%
- Review Turnaround: <5 minutes
- Bug Catch Rate: >30% pre-production

---

## When to Use

Use multi-ai-code-review when:

- Reviewing pull requests (any size)
- Auditing code quality before release
- Establishing consistent code review standards
- Security auditing code changes
- Performance profiling changes
- Technical debt assessment
- Onboarding reviews (mentorship mode)

**When NOT to Use**:
- Trivial changes (typos, comments only)
- Automated dependency updates (use dependabot labels)
- Generated code (migrations, scaffolds)

---

## Operations

### Operation 1: Quick Security Scan

**Time**: 2-5 minutes
**Automation**: 80%
**Purpose**: Fast security-focused review

**Process**:

1. **Scan for Critical Issues**:
```
Review this code for security vulnerabilities:
- SQL injection
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Hardcoded secrets/API keys
- Authentication bypasses
- Authorization flaws
- Input validation gaps
- Insecure dependencies

Code:
[PASTE CODE OR DIFF]

For each issue found, provide:
- Severity (Critical/High/Medium)
- Location (file:line)
- Description (what's wrong)
- Fix (specific code change)
```

2. **Validate with Gemini** (optional):
```bash
gemini -p "Verify these security findings. Are any false positives?
[PASTE CLAUDE FINDINGS]

Code context:
[PASTE RELEVANT CODE]"
```

3. **Output**: Security report with consensus findings

---

### Operation 2: Comprehensive PR Review

**Time**: 10-30 minutes
**Automation**: 60%
**Purpose**: Full multi-dimensional review

**Process**:

**Step 1: Gather Context**
```bash
# Get PR diff
git diff main...HEAD > /tmp/pr_diff.txt

# Identify affected areas
grep -E "^(\\+\\+\\+|---)" /tmp/pr_diff.txt | head -20
```

**Step 2: Run Parallel Agent Reviews**

Use Task tool to launch parallel agents:

```
Launch 3 parallel review agents:

Agent 1 (Security):
"Review this diff for security issues. Focus on:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization
- Input validation
- Secrets exposure
Diff: [DIFF]"

Agent 2 (Maintainability):
"Review this diff for maintainability. Focus on:
- Design patterns used correctly
- Code duplication (DRY)
- Modularity and cohesion
- Documentation quality
Diff: [DIFF]"

Agent 3 (Correctness):
"Review this diff for correctness. Focus on:
- Logic errors
- Edge cases not handled
- Test coverage gaps
- Error handling
Diff: [DIFF]"
```

**Step 3: Orchestrate & Deduplicate**
```
Synthesize findings from all agents:
[PASTE ALL AGENT OUTPUTS]

Tasks:
1. Remove duplicate findings
2. Rank by severity (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
3. Group by file
4. Generate summary table
5. Create final report with consensus issues only
```

**Step 4: Generate Report**

Output format:
```markdown
## PR Review Summary

| File | Risk | Issues | Critical | High | Medium |
|------|------|--------|----------|------|--------|
| auth.py | High | 3 | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| api.py | Medium | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

### Critical Issues (Block Merge)
1. **[auth.py:45]** SQL Injection vulnerability
   - Why: User input directly in query
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries

### High Issues (Require Fix)
...

### Consensus Score: 72/100
- Security: 65/100
- Performance: 80/100
- Maintainability: 70/100
- Correctness: 75/100
- Style: 85/100
```

---

### Operation 3: LLM-as-Judge Tribunal

**Time**: 5-15 minutes
**Automation**: 70%
**Purpose**: High-confidence findings through consensus

**Process**:

1. **Run Code Through Multiple Models**:

**Claude Analysis**:
```
Analyze this code for issues. Rate severity 1-10 for each:
[CODE]
```

**Gemini Analysis** (via CLI):
```bash
gemini -p "Analyze this code for issues. Rate severity 1-10 for each:
[CODE]"
```

**Codex Analysis** (via CLI):
```bash
codex "Analyze this code for issues. Rate severity 1-10 for each:
[CODE]"
```

2. **Calculate Consensus**:
```
Given these analyses from 3 AI models:

Claude: [FINDINGS]
Gemini: [FINDINGS]
Codex: [FINDINGS]

Identify issues where at least 2 models agree:
1. List consensus findings
2. Average severity scores
3. Note any disagreements
4. Final verdict for each issue
```

3. **Output**: High-confidence issue list (≥67% agreement)

---

### Operation 4: Mentorship Review

**Time**: 15-30 minutes
**Automation**: 40%
**Purpose**: Educational code review for learning

**Process**:

```
Review this code in mentorship mode. For a developer learning [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]:

Code: [CODE]

For each finding:
1. **What's the issue** (be encouraging, not critical)
2. **Why it matters** (explain the underlying concept)
3. **How to improve** (show before/after with explanation)
4. **Learn more** (link to relevant documentation)

Also highlight:
- What was done well
- Good patterns to continue using
- Growth opportunities

Tone: Supportive and educational, never condescending.
```

## Example Review Session

```
User: Review this PR for my authentication module

Claude: I'll perform a comprehensive multi-dimensional review.

[Launches parallel agents for security, maintainability, correctness]

## PR Review: Authentication Module

### Critical Issues (1)
1. **[auth.py:67]** Password stored in plaintext
   - Severity: Critical
   - Consensus: 3/3 models agree
   - Fix: Use bcrypt hashing
   ```python
   # Before
   user.password = request.password

   # After
   import bcrypt
   user.password = bcrypt.hashpw(request.password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())
   ```

### High Issues (2)
1. **[auth.py:45]** No rate limiting on login endpoint
2. **[auth.py:89]** JWT secret hardcoded

### Quality Score: 58/100 (Grade: F)
- Security: 35/100 (Critical issues)
- Performance: 70/100
- Maintainability: 65/100
- Correctness: 60/100
- Style: 80/100

### Recommendation: BLOCK MERGE
Resolve critical security issues before merging.
