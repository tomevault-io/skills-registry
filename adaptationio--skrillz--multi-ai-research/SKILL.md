# Multi-AI Research & Analysis

## Overview

Harnesses three AI systems (Claude via Task tool, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI) for comprehensive research and analysis with multi-perspective verification and iterative refinement.

**Purpose**: Produce analysis more thorough than any single AI could achieve through specialized roles, cross-validation, and systematic verification.

**Key Innovation**: Not just parallel execution - specialized research roles with cross-verification and iterative refinement until production-ready (quality ≥95/100, 100% citations, zero gaps).

**The 3 AI Systems**:
1. **Claude Subagents** (via Task tool) - Documentation, codebase analysis, synthesis
2. **Gemini CLI** - Web research, latest trends, community practices
3. **Codex CLI** - GitHub patterns, code examples, deep reasoning

**Quality Guarantees**:
- ✓ **100% coverage** - All objectives addressed, zero gaps
- ✓ **100% citations** - Every claim sourced (file:line or URL)
- ✓ **Multi-perspective** - 3 AI systems cross-validated
- ✓ **≥95/100 quality** - Verified through 3-pass system
- ✓ **Actionable** - Specific recommendations with examples
- ✓ **Resumable** - External memory enables multi-session work

## How It Works

### Progressive Disclosure

**Never reads files blindly**. Always uses 3-level approach:

**Level 1: Metadata (glob)** - ~50 tokens
```bash
glob "**/*.{ts,js,py}"     # Understand structure
glob "**/*.md"             # Find documentation
glob "**/package.json"     # Check dependencies
```

**Level 2: Patterns (grep)** - ~5k tokens
```bash
grep "export class|interface" --glob "**/*.ts"
grep "TODO|FIXME|BUG" --glob "**/*"
grep "password|secret|token" --glob "**/*.ts"
```

**Level 3: Reading (read)** - ~50k tokens
```bash
read "src/auth/login.ts"   # Only critical files
read "docs/architecture.md"
```

**Result**: 90%+ reduction in unnecessary file reads

### External Memory Architecture

All state saved to files, not context:

```
.analysis/
├── ANALYSIS_PLAN.md           # Strategy and assignments
├── research/
│   ├── claude-docs.md         # Claude research
│   ├── gemini-web.md          # Gemini research
│   └── codex-github.md        # Codex research
├── analysis/
│   ├── code-patterns.md       # Pattern analysis
│   └── architecture-map.md    # System map
├── verification/
│   └── cross-check.md         # Verification results
├── iterations/
│   ├── ITERATION_1.md         # First pass
│   └── ITERATION_2.md         # Gap fills
└── ANALYSIS_FINAL.md          # Complete report
```

**Benefits**:
- Survives context window limits
- Enables multi-session analysis
- Resumable from any checkpoint
- No information loss

### Cross-Validation Pattern

**High Confidence** (★★★★★): All 3 sources agree + code verification
**Medium Confidence** (★★★☆☆): 2/3 sources agree
**Requires Investigation** (★★☆☆☆): Sources conflict

**Example**:
```markdown
## JWT Implementation (High Confidence ★★★★★)

**Claude**: "Uses JWT with HS256" (src/auth/jwt.ts:15)
**Gemini**: "HS256 is industry standard 2024" (URL)
**Codex**: "150+ repos use HS256 pattern" (GitHub)
**Code**: Verified at src/auth/jwt.ts:18-22

**Recommendation**: Implementation correct per standards
```

### Quality Scoring

**Comprehensive rubric** (0-100):
- **Comprehensiveness** (/20): All aspects covered
- **Accuracy** (/20): All claims sourced and verified
- **Specificity** (/20): File:line precision, not vague
- **Actionability** (/20): Specific recommendations
- **Consistency** (/20): No contradictions

**Quality Gates**:
- ≥95: Production-ready
- 85-94: Needs minor refinement
- 75-84: Needs iteration
- <75: Requires rework

### Iterative Refinement

**Iteration 1** (Breadth): Broad coverage, identifies gaps
**Iteration 2** (Depth): Fill gaps, improve quality
**Iteration 3** (Polish): Final verification, perfection

**Automatic iteration** until:
- Quality ≥95
- Citation coverage = 100%
- Critical gaps = 0

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Objectives
```
❌ "Analyze the code"
✅ "Security analysis of authentication module for OWASP Top 10 compliance"
```

### 2. Trust the Verification
Multi-pass verification catches issues. If quality <95, iteration happens automatically.

### 3. Review External Memory
Check `.analysis/` folder during execution to see progress.

### 4. Leverage Citations
Every claim has file:line or URL. Use for validation and deep dives.

### 5. Multi-Session Projects
Large projects can span sessions:
```
Session 1: Initial analysis → ITERATION_1.md
Session 2: Gap filling → ITERATION_2.md
Session 3: Final polish → ANALYSIS_FINAL.md
```

### 6. Check All Three Perspectives
High-value insights often come from comparing AI perspectives.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Low Quality Score (<95)

**Cause**: Gaps in coverage or missing citations
**Solution**: Automatic iteration 2 fills gaps
**Check**: `.analysis/verification/cross-check.md` for details

### Missing Citations

**Cause**: Verification flags uncited claims
**Solution**: Iteration adds missing attributions
**Prevention**: All agents trained to cite sources

### Gemini/Codex Unavailable

**Fallback**: Claude-only analysis with warning
**Impact**: Reduced perspectives but still comprehensive
**Install**: `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli @openai/codex`

### Conflicting Information

**Resolution**: Synthesis phase investigates conflicts
**Method**: Check ground truth (actual code/docs)
**Output**: Documented reasoning for resolution
