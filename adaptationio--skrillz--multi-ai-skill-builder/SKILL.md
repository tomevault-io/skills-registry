# Multi-AI Skill Builder

## Overview

multi-ai-skill-builder is a meta-skill that systematizes the Multi-AI approach to building Claude Code skills. It coordinates multiple AI models (Claude, Gemini, Codex) through research, planning, and implementation phases to create comprehensive, production-ready skills.

**Purpose**: Build high-quality Claude Code skills using Multi-AI research and synthesis

**Pattern**: Workflow-based (5-step sequential process)

**Key Principles** (validated by tri-AI research):
1. **Multi-Source Research** - Claude for docs, Gemini for web, Codex for GitHub
2. **Synthesis Before Building** - Combine findings into coherent plan
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - SKILL.md + references/ + scripts/
4. **Pattern Compliance** - Follow established skill patterns
5. **Validation Loop** - Multi-AI review of generated skills
6. **Iterative Refinement** - Build → Review → Improve cycle

**Quality Targets**:
- Research coverage: 3+ sources (Claude + Gemini + Codex)
- Skill completeness: All required sections present
- Code examples: 5+ practical examples per skill
- Validation score: ≥85/100

---

## When to Use

Use multi-ai-skill-builder when:

- Creating new Claude Code skills from scratch
- Building skill families (related skills for a domain)
- Enhancing existing skills with new research
- Researching best practices for a technical domain
- Converting research into actionable skills
- Establishing skill development workflows

**When NOT to Use**:
- Simple skill updates (use direct editing)
- Trivial skills (<100 lines, single operation)
- Skills outside your domain expertise (research first)

---

## Prerequisites

### Required
- Skill topic/domain clearly defined
- Time for research (30-60 min) and building (60-120 min)
- Access to Claude (always available)

### Recommended
- Gemini CLI for web research
- Codex CLI for GitHub patterns
- Existing example skills to reference

### Understanding
- Claude Code skill structure
- YAML frontmatter format
- Progressive disclosure architecture

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Research Phase (Multi-AI)

**Time**: 30-60 minutes
**Purpose**: Gather comprehensive knowledge from multiple sources

**1.1 Claude Documentation Research**

Launch Claude subagent for official documentation:
```
Research [TOPIC] for Claude Code skill creation:

Focus on:
1. Official documentation and best practices
2. Existing similar skills in the codebase
3. API patterns and SDK usage
4. Common workflows and use cases

Output structured findings with:
- Key concepts
- Recommended patterns
- Code examples
- Gotchas and anti-patterns
```

**1.2 Gemini Web Research**

Use Gemini CLI for current best practices:
```bash
gemini -p "Research [TOPIC] best practices 2024-2025:
1. Industry standard approaches
2. Common patterns and anti-patterns
3. Tool comparisons and recommendations
4. Recent developments and trends
5. Real-world implementation examples

Provide comprehensive findings with sources."
```

**1.3 Codex GitHub Research**

Use Codex for code patterns:
```bash
codex "Research GitHub patterns for [TOPIC]:
1. Popular library implementations
2. Production code examples
3. Testing patterns
4. Configuration approaches
5. Error handling patterns

Provide code examples and best practices."
```

**1.4 Create Research Directory**

```bash
mkdir -p .analysis/[topic]-research
```

Save all research to:
- `.analysis/[topic]-research/claude-docs-research.md`
- `.analysis/[topic]-research/gemini-web-research.md`
- `.analysis/[topic]-research/codex-github-research.md`

---

### Step 2: Synthesis Phase

**Time**: 15-30 minutes
**Purpose**: Combine research into actionable plan

**2.1 Synthesize Findings**

```
Synthesize findings from multi-AI research:

Claude findings: [SUMMARY]
Gemini findings: [SUMMARY]
Codex findings: [SUMMARY]

Create unified synthesis:
1. Key patterns to implement
2. Best practices to follow
3. Anti-patterns to avoid
4. Recommended skill structure
5. Operations/workflows to include
6. Code examples to provide
```

**2.2 Create Synthesis Document**

Save to `.analysis/[topic]-research/SYNTHESIS_AND_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
# [Topic] Skill Synthesis

## Research Sources
- Claude: Documentation analysis
- Gemini: Web best practices
- Codex: GitHub patterns

## Key Findings
1. [Finding 1]
2. [Finding 2]
...

## Recommended Structure
- Pattern: [workflow/task/reference/capabilities]
- Operations: [list]
- References: [list]

## Implementation Plan
1. Create SKILL.md with [structure]
2. Add references for [topics]
3. Include [N] code examples
4. Cover [operations/workflows]

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] YAML frontmatter complete
- [ ] Trigger keywords included
- [ ] 5+ code examples
- [ ] Error handling covered
- [ ] All patterns validated
```

---

### Step 3: Build Phase

**Time**: 60-90 minutes
**Purpose**: Create the skill files

**3.1 Create Directory Structure**

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/[skill-name]/references
mkdir -p .claude/skills/[skill-name]/scripts  # if needed
```

**3.2 Build SKILL.md**

Follow the template structure:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name-in-hyphen-case
description: [Purpose]. [Pattern type]. Use when [triggers].
allowed-tools: Task, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash
---

# Skill Name

# Gemini for 2024-2025 best practices
gemini -p "Research ECS/Fargate best practices 2024-2025..."

# Codex for GitHub patterns
codex "Research GitHub patterns for ECS/Terraform..."
```

### Synthesis Phase

- Identified 5 skills to build
- Mapped to existing EKS skill patterns

### Build Phase
- Created boto3-ecs (SDK patterns)
- Created terraform-ecs (IaC)
- Created ecs-fargate (Fargate specifics)
- Created ecs-deployment (strategies)
- Created ecs-troubleshooting (debugging)

### Result
- 2,209+ lines across 15 files
