# Planning Architect

## Overview

planning-architect systematically plans Claude Code skill development from initial concept to detailed implementation blueprint. It guides you through six sequential steps to create comprehensive skill plans that ensure successful development.

**Purpose**: Transform skill ideas into actionable implementation plans with clear structure, accurate estimates, and identified dependencies.

**Value**: Prevents rework, reduces development time, ensures consistency, and produces better-designed skills through systematic planning.

**When to Use**:
- Planning new skills from scratch
- Converting existing documentation into skills
- Architecting complex multi-file skills
- Planning skill improvements or refactoring
- Coordinating dependent skill development

## Prerequisites

Before planning a skill, gather:

1. **Problem Definition**: Clear understanding of what problem the skill solves
2. **Domain Knowledge**: Familiarity with the domain being captured
3. **User Context**: Understanding of who will use the skill and how
4. **Existing Resources**: Any documentation, examples, or patterns to reference
5. **Skill-Builder Context**: Familiarity with skill-builder-generic patterns

## Planning Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Requirements

**Objective**: Clearly define what the skill must accomplish and its scope

**Process**:

1. **Define the Problem**
   - What specific problem does this skill solve?
   - What pain point does it address?
   - What would happen without this skill?

2. **Identify Target Users**
   - Who will use this skill? (You, team, community)
   - What is their expertise level?
   - What context will they invoke it in?

3. **Capture Domain Knowledge**
   - What domain expertise must be captured?
   - What workflows need documentation?
   - What best practices should be included?
   - What anti-patterns should be avoided?

4. **Determine Scope**
   - What is explicitly in scope?
   - What is explicitly out of scope?
   - What are the boundaries?
   - What is the minimum viable skill?

5. **Identify Existing Resources**
   - Are there similar skills to reference?
   - Is there existing documentation to convert?
   - Are there community patterns to follow?
   - Are there anti-patterns to avoid?

**Questions to Answer**:

```
Problem Definition:
- What problem does this skill solve?
- Who experiences this problem?
- How do they currently solve it (if at all)?
- What would success look like?

Scope:
- What is the primary objective?
- What are secondary objectives?
- What is explicitly out of scope?
- What is the minimum viable version?

Users:
- Who will use this skill?
- What is their expertise level?
- What context will they invoke it in?
- What other skills do they likely have?

Domain:
- What domain knowledge is required?
- What workflows exist in this domain?
- What terminology is standard?
- What are common pitfalls?

Resources:
- Are there similar skills to study?
- Is there documentation to convert?
- Are there examples to follow?
- What research is needed?
```

**Output**: Requirements document answering all questions above

**Example**:
```
Problem: Developers waste time debugging Railway deployments
Users: Development team with Node.js experience
Domain: Railway deployment, Docker, environment config
Scope: Railway-specific deployment workflow for Node.js + React
Out of Scope: Other platforms (Vercel, AWS), other languages
Resources: Railway docs, existing deployment notes
MVP: Basic deployment workflow with common troubleshooting
```

### Step 2: Select Organizational Pattern

**Objective**: Choose the optimal organizational pattern for this skill

**The 4 Organizational Patterns**:

#### Pattern 1: Workflow-Based
**Use When**: Sequential processes with clear steps where order matters

**Characteristics**:
- Linear progression (Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3)
- Each step builds on previous steps
- Clear start and end points
- Dependencies between steps

**Examples**:
- Deployment workflows
- API integration processes
- Testing workflows
- Setup/configuration sequences

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Workflow
### Step 1: [Action]
### Step 2: [Action]
### Step 3: [Action]
```

**Choose This When**:
- Process has clear sequential steps
- Order of operations matters
- Steps have dependencies
- There's a defined goal at the end

---

#### Pattern 2: Task-Based
**Use When**: Independent operations without order dependency

**Characteristics**:
- Tasks can be performed in any order
- No dependencies between tasks
- Quick reference format
- Each task is self-contained

**Examples**:
- Troubleshooting guides
- Utility collections
- Command references
- Independent operations

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Tasks
### Task A: [Action]
### Task B: [Action]
### Task C: [Action]
```

**Choose This When**:
- Operations are independent
- Order doesn't matter
- Users will perform subset of tasks
- Quick lookup is primary use case

---

#### Pattern 3: Reference/Guidelines
**Use When**: Standards, patterns, design systems, best practices

**Characteristics**:
- Reference material (look-up)
- Guidelines and standards
- Comprehensive coverage
- Examples and specifications

**Examples**:
- Design systems
- Coding standards
- API documentation
- Style guides

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Guidelines
### Guideline 1: [Concept]
### Guideline 2: [Concept]

## Reference
### Component A
### Component B
```

**Choose This When**:
- Documenting standards or patterns
- Creating reference material
- Establishing guidelines
- Comprehensive coverage needed

---

#### Pattern 4: Capabilities-Based
**Use When**: Integrated feature suites with multiple entry points

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple interconnected features
- Various entry points
- Features work together
- Complex integrations

**Examples**:
- Complex systems
- Platforms with multiple features
- Toolkits with related capabilities

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Capabilities
### Capability A: [Feature]
### Capability B: [Feature]

## Integration
How capabilities work together
```

**Choose This When**:
- Multiple related features
- Features can be used independently or together
- Multiple valid starting points
- Complex system with many capabilities

---

**Decision Process**:

```
START
↓
Does the skill describe a sequential process?
├─ YES → Is order important?
│         ├─ YES → WORKFLOW-BASED
│         └─ NO → TASK-BASED
│
└─ NO → Is it primarily reference material?
         ├─ YES → REFERENCE/GUIDELINES
         └─ NO → Does it have multiple integrated features?
                  ├─ YES → CAPABILITIES-BASED
                  └─ NO → Re-examine requirements (likely TASK-BASED)
```

**Pattern Selection Factors**:

| Factor | Workflow | Task | Reference | Capabilities |
|--------|----------|------|-----------|--------------|
| Order matters | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ~ |
| Dependencies | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Quick lookup | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ~ |
| Sequential process | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ~ |
| Standards/guidelines | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Multiple features | ~ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Integration complexity | ~ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |

**Output**: Selected organizational pattern with justification

**Example**:
```
Pattern: Workflow-Based
Justification: Railway deployment is sequential (prepare → configure → deploy → verify)
Alternative Considered: Task-based rejected because order matters
```

**See Also**: [references/pattern-selection-guide.md](references/pattern-selection-guide.md) for comprehensive decision tree and examples

---

### Step 3: Plan File Structure

**Objective**: Define complete file structure using progressive disclosure

**Progressive Disclosure Architecture**:

The key principle: **Keep SKILL.md lean, bundle details in references/**

**Three-Level System**:

1. **SKILL.md** (Always Loaded)
   - Target: <5,000 words (~1,000-1,500 lines)
   - Content: Overview, quick start, key workflows, core concepts
   - Purpose: Provides essential context without overwhelming Claude's context window

2. **references/** (Loaded On-Demand)
   - Target: 10,000+ words okay per file
   - Content: Comprehensive guides, detailed explanations, extensive examples
   - Purpose: Deep details available when needed without bloating main skill

3. **scripts/** (Loaded When Executed)
   - Target: Any size
   - Content: Automation helpers, validation tools, generators
   - Purpose: Executable tools that extend skill capabilities

4. **templates/** (Loaded When Needed)
   - Target: Any size
   - Content: Reusable patterns, boilerplate code, scaffolds
   - Purpose: Starting points for common patterns

**File Structure Planning**:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter
│   ├── Overview
│   ├── Prerequisites (if needed)
│   ├── Main content (workflow/tasks/guidelines/capabilities)
│   ├── Quick Start
│   ├── Examples (brief)

   └── error-handling-guide.md
   ```

2. **By Depth** (Progressive Learning)
   ```
   references/
   ├── basics-guide.md
   ├── intermediate-guide.md
   └── advanced-guide.md
   ```

3. **By Workflow Step** (For Workflow-Based)
   ```
   references/
   ├── step1-preparation-guide.md
   ├── step2-execution-guide.md
   └── step3-validation-guide.md
   ```

4. **By Use Case** (For Task-Based)
   ```
   references/
   ├── use-case-api-integration.md
   ├── use-case-database-setup.md
   └── use-case-testing.md
   ```

**Linking to References**:

Always use relative paths with descriptive link text:

```markdown

### Step 4: Estimate Complexity

**Objective**: Estimate development time and effort required

**Complexity Factors**:

1. **Skill Size**
   - Minimal (SKILL.md only): 2-4 hours
   - Small (SKILL.md + 1-2 references): 6-10 hours
   - Medium (SKILL.md + 3-5 references): 12-18 hours
   - Large (SKILL.md + 6+ references + scripts): 20-30 hours
   - Very Large (Multiple scripts, templates, extensive docs): 30+ hours

2. **Pattern Complexity**
   - Workflow-based: Medium (need to document each step clearly)
   - Task-based: Low-Medium (independent tasks easier to document)
   - Reference/Guidelines: Medium-High (requires comprehensive coverage)
   - Capabilities-based: High (complex interactions to document)

3. **Domain Complexity**
   - Familiar domain: 1x multiplier
   - Some learning needed: 1.5x multiplier
   - Significant research needed: 2x multiplier
   - Novel/complex domain: 2.5x+ multiplier

4. **Automation Requirements**
   - No scripts: 0 additional hours
   - Simple scripts (1-2): +4-6 hours
   - Complex scripts (3+): +10-15 hours
   - Interactive tools: +15-20 hours

5. **Research Requirements**
   - Existing documentation: 1x
   - Some research needed: +2-4 hours
   - Extensive research: +8-12 hours
   - No existing resources: +15+ hours

**Estimation Formula**:

```
Base Time = Skill Size (from factor 1)
Pattern Multiplier = Factor 2
Domain Multiplier = Factor 3
Automation Add = Factor 4
Research Add = Factor 5

Total Estimate = (Base Time × Pattern Multiplier × Domain Multiplier) + Automation Add + Research Add
```

**Estimation Examples**:

**Example 1: Simple Troubleshooting Skill**
```
Base: Small (6-10h) = 8h
Pattern: Task-based (1x)
Domain: Familiar (1x)
Automation: None (0h)
Research: Existing docs (0h)

Total: 8h × 1 × 1 + 0 + 0 = 8 hours
```

**Example 2: Complex Deployment Workflow**
```
Base: Large (20-30h) = 25h
Pattern: Workflow-based (1.2x)
Domain: Some learning (1.5x)
Automation: Simple scripts (5h)
Research: Some needed (3h)

Total: 25h × 1.2 × 1.5 + 5 + 3 = 53 hours
```

**Example 3: Design System Reference**
```
Base: Medium (12-18h) = 15h
Pattern: Reference/Guidelines (1.3x)
Domain: Familiar (1x)
Automation: None (0h)
Research: Existing docs (0h)

Total: 15h × 1.3 × 1 + 0 + 0 = 19.5 hours
```

**Estimation Checklist**:

- [ ] Counted number of reference files needed
- [ ] Assessed domain knowledge gap
- [ ] Identified automation needs
- [ ] Determined research requirements
- [ ] Applied pattern complexity multiplier
- [ ] Added buffer for iteration (10-20%)
- [ ] Validated estimate seems reasonable

**Output**: Time estimate with breakdown by component

**Example**:
```
Estimated Development Time: 42-48 hours

Breakdown:
- SKILL.md: 8 hours
- references/ (4 files): 20 hours
  - pattern-selection-guide.md: 6h
  - structure-planning-guide.md: 6h
  - complexity-estimation-guide.md: 4h
  - dependency-analysis-guide.md: 4h
- scripts/plan-skill.py: 10 hours
- templates/: 2 hours
- Validation & testing: 4 hours

Total: 44 hours (42-48 hour range)
```

## Best Practices

### Planning Best Practices

1. **Start with Why**
   - Clearly articulate the problem
   - Validate the need before planning
   - Consider if skill is the right solution

2. **Choose Pattern Carefully**
   - Pattern drives entire structure
   - Consider user mental model
   - Validate pattern with examples

3. **Plan for Evolution**
   - Skills will grow over time
   - Structure should accommodate additions
   - Leave room for future enhancements

4. **Optimize Context Usage**
   - Keep SKILL.md lean
   - Move details to references
   - Every word costs context tokens

5. **Validate Early**
   - Review plan before implementation
   - Get feedback from potential users
   - Adjust based on feedback

### Common Planning Mistakes

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Problem: Planning too much at once
   - Solution: Define MVP, plan iterations

2. **Wrong Pattern**
   - Problem: Choosing workflow for independent tasks
   - Solution: Use decision tree carefully

3. **Poor Progressive Disclosure**
   - Problem: Putting everything in SKILL.md
   - Solution: Follow <5,000 word guideline

4. **Underestimating Complexity**
   - Problem: Unrealistic time estimates
   - Solution: Use formula, add buffer

5. **Ignoring Dependencies**
   - Problem: Missing prerequisite skills
   - Solution: Complete dependency analysis

## Quick Reference

### The 6-Step Planning Process

| Step | Focus | Key Output | Time |
|------|-------|------------|------|
| 1. Analyze Requirements | Problem, users, scope, domain | Requirements document | 30-60m |
| 2. Choose Pattern | Workflow/task/reference/capabilities | Pattern selection with rationale | 15-30m |
| 3. Design Structure | Files, sections, progressive disclosure | File structure plan | 30-45m |
| 4. Plan Content | Section-by-section content outline | Content plan | 45-90m |
| 5. Estimate Complexity | Time, dependencies, risks | Effort estimate | 20-30m |
| 6. Create Plan Document | Consolidated implementation plan | Complete skill plan | 30-45m |

**Total Planning Time**: 3-5 hours for comprehensive plan

### The 4 Organizational Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | Structure | Example |
|---------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Workflow** | Sequential dependencies, process with steps | Numbered steps (Step 1→2→3) | deployment-guide, development-workflow |
| **Task** | Independent operations, no required order | Unnumbered operations | railway-troubleshooting, review-multi |
| **Reference** | Standards, guidelines, design systems | Topic-based sections | botanical-design, common-patterns |
| **Capabilities** | Multiple related features used together | Integrated capabilities | Complex multi-feature skills |

### Pattern Selection Decision Tree

```
Do steps have sequential dependencies?
├─ Yes → WORKFLOW (use numbered steps)
└─ No → Are operations independent?
    ├─ Yes → TASK (use unnumbered operations)
    └─ No → Is it standards/guidelines?
        ├─ Yes → REFERENCE (topic-based organization)
        └─ No → CAPABILITIES (integrated features)
```

### Complexity Estimation Guidelines

| Complexity | Files | Lines | Time | Characteristics |
|------------|-------|-------|------|-----------------|
| **Simple** | 1-3 | 400-800 | 2-4h | Single file or minimal references |
| **Medium** | 4-8 | 1,500-3,000 | 8-15h | Multiple references, maybe scripts |
| **Complex** | 9-15+ | 3,000-5,000+ | 20-40h | Extensive references, automation scripts |

### Progressive Disclosure Rules

- **SKILL.md**: <1,200 lines ideal (overview + essentials)
- **references/**: 300-600 lines per file (detailed guides)
- **scripts/**: Automation tools (loaded when needed)

**Decision**: If content >1,000 lines → move detailed content to references/

### Common Planning Outputs

**Requirements Document**:
- Problem definition
- User analysis
- Scope boundaries
- Domain knowledge capture

**Structure Plan**:
- File organization
- Section outline
