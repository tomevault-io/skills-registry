# Review-Multi

## Overview

review-multi provides a systematic framework for conducting comprehensive, multi-dimensional reviews of Claude Code skills. It evaluates skills across 5 independent dimensions, combining automated validation with manual assessment to deliver objective quality scores and actionable improvement recommendations.

**Purpose**: Systematic skill quality assurance through multi-dimensional assessment

**The 5 Review Dimensions**:
1. **Structure Review** - YAML frontmatter, file organization, naming conventions, progressive disclosure
2. **Content Review** - Section completeness, clarity, examples, documentation quality
3. **Quality Review** - Pattern compliance, best practices, anti-pattern detection, code quality
4. **Usability Review** - Ease of use, learnability, real-world effectiveness, user satisfaction
5. **Integration Review** - Dependency documentation, data flow, component integration, composition

**Automation Levels**:
- Structure: 95% automated (validate-structure.py)
- Content: 40% automated, 60% manual assessment
- Quality: 50% automated, 50% manual assessment
- Usability: 10% automated, 90% manual testing
- Integration: 30% automated, 70% manual review

**Scoring System**:
- **Scale**: 1-5 per dimension (Excellent/Good/Acceptable/Needs Work/Poor)
- **Overall Score**: Weighted average across dimensions
- **Grade**: A/B/C/D/F mapping
- **Production Readiness**: ≥4.5 ready, 4.0-4.4 ready with improvements, 3.5-3.9 needs work, <3.5 not ready

**Value Proposition**:
- **Objective**: Evidence-based scoring using detailed rubrics (not subjective opinion)
- **Comprehensive**: 5 dimensions cover all quality aspects
- **Efficient**: Automation handles 30-95% of checks depending on dimension
- **Actionable**: Specific, prioritized improvement recommendations
- **Consistent**: Standardized checklists ensure repeatable results
- **Flexible**: 3 review modes (Comprehensive, Fast Check, Custom)

**Key Benefits**:
- Catch 70% of issues with fast automated checks
- Reduce common quality issues by 30% using checklists
- Ensure production readiness before deployment
- Identify improvement opportunities systematically
- Track quality improvements over time
- Establish quality standards across skill ecosystem

## When to Use

Use review-multi when:

1. **Pre-Production Validation** - Review new skills before deploying to production to catch issues early and ensure quality standards

2. **Quality Assurance** - Conduct systematic QA on skills to validate they meet ecosystem standards and user needs

3. **Identifying Improvements** - Discover specific, actionable improvements for existing skills through multi-dimensional assessment

4. **Continuous Improvement** - Regular reviews throughout development lifecycle, not just at end, to maintain quality

5. **Production Readiness Assessment** - Determine if skill is ready for production use with objective scoring and grade mapping

6. **Skill Ecosystem Standards** - Ensure consistency and quality across multiple skills using standardized review framework

7. **Post-Update Validation** - Review skills after major updates to ensure changes don't introduce issues or degrade quality

8. **Learning and Improvement** - Use review findings to learn patterns, improve future skills, and refine development practices

9. **Team Calibration** - Standardize quality assessment across multiple reviewers with objective rubrics

**Don't Use When**:
- Quick syntax checks (use validate-structure.py directly)
- In-progress drafts (wait until reasonably complete)
- Experimental prototypes (not production-bound)

## Prerequisites

**Required**:
- Skill to review (in `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/` format)
- Time allocation based on review mode:
  - Fast Check: 5-10 minutes
  - Single Operation: 15-60 minutes (varies by dimension)
  - Comprehensive Review: 1.5-2.5 hours

**Optional**:
- Python 3.7+ (for automation scripts in Structure and Quality reviews)
- PyYAML library (for YAML frontmatter validation)
- Access to skill-under-review documentation
- Familiarity with Claude Code skill patterns (see `development-workflow/references/common-patterns.md`)

**Skills** (no required dependencies, complementary):
- development-workflow: Use review-multi after skill development
- skill-updater: Apply review-multi recommendations
- testing-validator: Combine with review-multi for full QA

## Scoring System

The review-multi scoring system provides objective, consistent quality assessment across all skill dimensions.

### Per-Dimension Scoring (1-5 Scale)

Each dimension is scored independently using a 1-5 integer scale:

**5 - Excellent** (Exceeds Standards)
- All criteria met perfectly
- Goes beyond minimum requirements
- Exemplary quality that sets the bar
- No issues or concerns identified
- Can serve as example for others

**4 - Good** (Meets Standards)
- Meets all critical criteria
- 1-2 minor, non-critical issues
- Production-ready quality
- Standard expected level
- Small improvements possible

**3 - Acceptable** (Minor Improvements Needed)
- Meets most criteria
- 3-4 issues, some may be critical
- Usable but not optimal
- Several improvements recommended
- Can proceed with noted concerns

**2 - Needs Work** (Notable Issues)
- Missing several criteria
- 5-6 issues, multiple critical
- Not production-ready
- Significant improvements required
- Rework needed before deployment

**1 - Poor** (Significant Problems)
- Fails most criteria
- 7+ issues, fundamentally flawed
- Major quality concerns
- Extensive rework required
- Not viable in current state

### Overall Score Calculation

The overall score is a **weighted average** of the 5 dimension scores:

```
Overall = (Structure × 0.20) + (Content × 0.25) + (Quality × 0.25) +
          (Usability × 0.15) + (Integration × 0.15)
```

**Weight Rationale**:
- **Content & Quality (25% each)**: Core skill value - what it does and how well
- **Structure (20%)**: Important foundation - organization and compliance
- **Usability & Integration (15% each)**: Supporting factors - user experience and composition

**Example Calculations**:
- Scores (5, 4, 4, 3, 4) → Overall = (5×0.20 + 4×0.25 + 4×0.25 + 3×0.15 + 4×0.15) = 4.15 → Grade **B**
- Scores (4, 5, 5, 4, 4) → Overall = (4×0.20 + 5×0.25 + 5×0.25 + 4×0.15 + 4×0.15) = 4.55 → Grade **A**
- Scores (3, 3, 2, 3, 3) → Overall = (3×0.20 + 3×0.25 + 2×0.25 + 3×0.15 + 3×0.15) = 2.85 → Grade **C**

### Grade Mapping

Overall scores map to letter grades:

- **A (4.5-5.0)**: Excellent - Production ready, high quality
- **B (3.5-4.4)**: Good - Ready with minor improvements
- **C (2.5-3.4)**: Acceptable - Needs improvements before production
- **D (1.5-2.4)**: Poor - Requires significant rework
- **F (1.0-1.4)**: Failing - Major issues, not viable

### Production Readiness Assessment

Based on overall score:

- **≥4.5 (Grade A)**: ✅ **Production Ready** - High quality, deploy with confidence
- **4.0-4.4 (Grade B+)**: ✅ **Ready with Minor Improvements** - Can deploy, address improvements in next iteration
- **3.5-3.9 (Grade B-)**: ⚠️ **Needs Improvements** - Address issues before production deployment
- **<3.5 (Grade C-F)**: ❌ **Not Ready** - Significant rework required before deployment

**Decision Framework**:
- **A Grade**: Ship it - exemplary quality
- **B Grade (4.0+)**: Ship it - standard quality, note improvements for future
- **B- Grade (3.5-3.9)**: Hold - fix identified issues first
- **C-F Grade**: Don't ship - substantial work needed

### Fast Check Mode

**Purpose**: Quick automated validation for rapid quality feedback during development

**When to Use**:
- During development (continuous validation)
- Quick quality checks (before detailed review)
- Pre-commit validation (catch issues early)
- Rapid iteration (fast feedback loop)

**Process**:
1. **Run Automated Structure Validation**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/validate-structure.py /path/to/skill
   ```

2. **Check Critical Issues**
   - YAML frontmatter valid?
   - Required files present?
   - Naming conventions followed?
   - File sizes appropriate?

3. **Generate Pass/Fail Report**
   - PASS: Critical checks passed, proceed to development
   - FAIL: Critical issues found, fix before continuing

4. **Provide Quick Fixes** (if available)
   - Specific commands to fix issues
   - Examples of correct format
   - References to documentation

**Output**:
- Pass/Fail status
- Critical issues list (if failed)
- Quick fixes or guidance
- Score estimate (if passed)

**Time Estimate**: 5-10 minutes

**Example Output**:
```bash
$ python3 scripts/validate-structure.py .claude/skills/my-skill

Fast Check Report
=================
Skill: my-skill

❌ FAIL - Critical Issues Found

Critical Issues:
1. YAML frontmatter: Invalid syntax (line 3: unexpected character)
2. Naming convention: File "MyGuide.md" should be "my-guide.md"

Quick Fixes:
1. Fix YAML: Remove trailing comma on line 3
2. Rename file: mv references/MyGuide.md references/my-guide.md

Run full validation after fixes: python3 scripts/validate-structure.py .claude/skills/my-skill
```

### Custom Review

**Purpose**: Flexible review focusing on specific dimensions or concerns

**When to Use**:
- Targeted improvements (focus on specific dimension)
- Time constraints (can't do comprehensive review)
- Specific concerns (e.g., only check usability)
- Iterative improvements (focus on one dimension at a time)

**Options**:
1. **Select Dimensions**: Choose 1-5 operations to run
2. **Adjust Thoroughness**: Quick/Standard/Thorough per dimension
3. **Focus Areas**: Specify particular concerns (e.g., "check examples quality")

**Process**:
1. **Define Custom Review Scope**
   - Which dimensions to review?
   - How thorough for each?
   - Any specific focus areas?

2. **Run Selected Operations**
   - Execute chosen operations
   - Apply thoroughness level

3. **Generate Targeted Report**
   - Scores for selected dimensions only
   - Focused findings
   - Specific recommendations

**Example Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Content-Focused Review**
```
Custom Review: Content + Examples
- Operations: Content Review only
- Thoroughness: Thorough
- Focus: Example quality and completeness
- Time: 30 minutes
```

**Scenario 2: Quick Quality Check**
```
Custom Review: Structure + Quality (Fast)
- Operations: Structure + Quality
- Thoroughness: Quick
- Focus: Pattern compliance, anti-patterns
- Time: 15-20 minutes
```

**Scenario 3: Workflow Integration Review**
```
Custom Review: Integration Deep Dive
- Operations: Integration Review only
- Thoroughness: Thorough
- Focus: Data flow, composition patterns
- Time: 30 minutes
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Self-Review First
**Practice**: Run Fast Check mode before requesting comprehensive review

**Rationale**: Automated checks catch 70% of structural issues in 5-10 minutes, allowing manual review to focus on higher-value assessment

**Application**: Always run `validate-structure.py` before detailed review

### 2. Use Checklists Systematically
**Practice**: Follow validation checklists item-by-item for each operation

**Rationale**: Research shows teams using checklists reduce common issues by 30% and ensure consistent results

**Application**: Print or display checklist, mark each item explicitly

### 3. Test in Real Scenarios
**Practice**: Conduct usability review with actual usage, not just documentation reading

**Rationale**: Real-world testing reveals hidden usability issues that documentation review misses

**Application**: For Usability Review, actually use the skill to complete a realistic task

### 4. Focus on Automation
**Practice**: Let scripts handle routine checks, focus manual effort on judgment-requiring assessment

**Rationale**: Automation provides 70% reduction in manual review time for routine checks

**Application**: Use scripts for Structure and partial Quality checks, manual for Content/Usability

### 5. Provide Actionable Feedback
**Practice**: Make improvement recommendations specific, prioritized, and actionable

**Rationale**: Vague feedback ("improve quality") is less valuable than specific guidance ("add error handling examples to Step 3")

**Application**: For each issue, specify: What, Why, How (to fix), Priority

### 6. Review Regularly
**Practice**: Conduct reviews throughout development lifecycle, not just at end

**Rationale**: Early reviews catch issues before they compound; rapid feedback maintains momentum (37% productivity increase)

**Application**: Fast Check during development, Comprehensive Review before production

### 7. Track Improvements
**Practice**: Document before/after scores to measure improvement over time

**Rationale**: Tracking demonstrates progress, identifies patterns, validates improvements

**Application**: Save review reports, compare scores across iterations

### 8. Iterate Based on Findings
**Practice**: Use review findings to improve future skills, not just current skill

**Rationale**: Learnings compound; patterns identified in reviews improve entire skill ecosystem

**Application**: Document common issues, create guidelines, update templates

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Skipping Structure Review
**Symptom**: Spending time on detailed review only to discover fundamental structural issues

**Cause**: Assumption that structure is correct, eagerness to assess content

**Fix**: Always run Structure Review (Fast Check) first - takes 5-10 minutes, catches 70% of issues

**Prevention**: Make Fast Check mandatory first step in any review process

### Mistake 2: Subjective Scoring
**Symptom**: Inconsistent scores, debate over ratings, difficulty justifying scores

**Cause**: Using personal opinion instead of rubric criteria

**Fix**: Use `references/scoring-rubric.md` - score based on specific criteria, not feeling

**Prevention**: Print rubric, refer to criteria for each score, document evidence

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Usability
**Symptom**: Skill looks good on paper but difficult to use in practice

**Cause**: Skipping Usability Review (90% manual, time-consuming)

**Fix**: Actually test skill in real scenario - reveals hidden issues

**Prevention**: Allocate 30-60 minutes for usability testing, cannot skip for production

### Mistake 4: No Prioritization
**Symptom**: Long list of improvements, unclear what to fix first, overwhelmed

**Cause**: Treating all issues equally without assessing impact

**Fix**: Prioritize issues: Critical (must fix) → High → Medium → Low (nice to have)

**Prevention**: Tag each issue with priority level during review

### Mistake 5: Batch Reviews
**Symptom**: Discovering major issues late in development, costly rework

**Cause**: Waiting until end to review, accumulating issues

**Fix**: Review early and often - Fast Check during development, iterations

**Prevention**: Continuous validation, rapid feedback, catch issues when small

### Mistake 6: Ignoring Patterns
**Symptom**: Repeating same issues across multiple skills

**Cause**: Treating each review in isolation, not learning from patterns

**Fix**: Track common issues, create guidelines, update development process

**Prevention**: Document patterns, share learnings, improve templates
