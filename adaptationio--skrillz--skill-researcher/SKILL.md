   ```

6. **Extract Actionable Insights**:
   - What decisions can be made?
   - What approaches should be used?
   - What should be avoided?
   - What needs further research?

**Example**:

```markdown
# Research Synthesis: Claude Code Skill Organization

## Research Goal
Determine best practices for organizing Claude Code skills with comprehensive workflows.

## Sources Consulted
1. Official Claude Code documentation (2025, official, highest credibility)
2. anthropic/anthropic-skills GitHub (2025, official examples, high credibility)
3. Web search results: "Claude Code skills" best practices (2024-2025, mixed credibility)

## Key Findings

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern
**Pattern**: Three-tier architecture (SKILL.md → references/ → scripts/)
**Sources**: Official docs, all official examples, community consensus
**Evidence**:
- Docs state: "SKILL.md recommended < 5,000 words"
- All 7 official examples use this pattern
- Community skills (40+ analyzed) overwhelmingly use this

### Workflow Organization
**Pattern**: Sequential steps with clear numbering and transitions
**Sources**: deployment-guide, medirecords-integration examples
**Evidence**:
```markdown
## Step 1: [Action]
[Content]
**Next**: Proceed to Step 2
```

### YAML Frontmatter
**Pattern**: Minimal (name + description only)
**Sources**: All official examples, documentation
**Evidence**: Consistent across 100% of examples

## Best Practices Identified
1. Keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words (from official docs + all examples)
2. Use numbered workflow steps with transitions (from 6/7 workflow examples)
3. Include validation checklists (from 5/7 examples)
4. Provide examples in every major section (from documentation + examples)
5. Use hyphen-case for naming (from all official skills)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
1. Monolithic SKILL.md files (>10,000 words) - hurts performance
2. Missing YAML frontmatter - skill won't be discovered
3. No examples - users can't visualize usage
4. Vague validation criteria - can't verify success

## Recommendations
1. Use three-tier progressive disclosure for all skills
2. Adopt numbered workflow steps with transitions
3. Include validation checklist in each step/operation
4. Provide 2-3 examples per major concept
5. Keep SKILL.md focused (<3,000 words ideal, <5,000 max)

## Examples
[From synthesis document, include actual code]

## References

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Single Source Research

**Problem**: Relying on one source, missing broader context
- Only read one blog post
- Trust first search result
- Skip official documentation

**Fix**: Always consult 3-5 sources, prioritize official docs

### Mistake 2: No Source Documentation

**Problem**: Can't verify findings or provide references
- No URLs captured
- Can't remember where information came from
- Unable to validate later

**Fix**: Document source URL, date, and credibility for every finding

### Mistake 3: Accepting Outdated Information

**Problem**: Using old practices that have evolved
- 2020 blog post (pre-Claude Code)
- Deprecated APIs
- Old best practices

**Fix**: Filter by date, search for "2024" or "2025", check official docs

### Mistake 4: Skipping Synthesis

**Problem**: Have data but no insights
- Raw notes without organization
- Can't make decisions
- No actionable recommendations

**Fix**: Always synthesize findings into themes and recommendations

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Credibility

**Problem**: Treating all sources equally
- Personal blog = official docs
