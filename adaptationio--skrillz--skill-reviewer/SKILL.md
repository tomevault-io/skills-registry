# Skill Reviewer

## Overview

skill-reviewer identifies specific, actionable improvements for Claude Code skills. While review-multi provides comprehensive scoring (1-5), skill-reviewer focuses on finding and documenting improvement opportunities.

**Purpose**: Improvement discovery for existing skills

**Integration with review-multi**:
- review-multi: Comprehensive scoring, production readiness
- skill-reviewer: Improvement hunting, enhancement focus
- **Use together**: review-multi scores, skill-reviewer improves

**The 4 Review Operations**:
1. **Content Enhancement Review** - Find content that could be clearer, more complete, better examples
2. **Usability Improvement Review** - Identify user experience enhancements
3. **Integration Opportunity Review** - Find integration and composition opportunities
4. **Efficiency Improvement Review** - Identify ways to make skill more efficient

## When to Use

- Finding improvements for good skills (score 4-5 but could be better)
- Post-deployment enhancement planning
- Continuous improvement iterations
- User feedback incorporation
- Periodic skill refreshes
