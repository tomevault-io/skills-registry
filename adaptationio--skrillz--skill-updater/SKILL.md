# Skill Updater

## Overview

skill-updater provides systematic workflow for applying improvements to existing Claude Code skills based on review findings, user feedback, or identified opportunities.

**Purpose**: Systematic skill improvement and enhancement

**Integration**:
- review-multi → identifies improvements
- skill-reviewer → finds opportunities
- **skill-updater** → applies changes systematically
- skill-validator → validates changes

**Update Workflow** (5 steps):
1. **Plan Updates** - Review recommendations, prioritize, plan changes
2. **Backup Skill** - Save current version before changes
3. **Apply Changes** - Implement improvements systematically
4. **Validate Changes** - Ensure improvements effective, no regressions
5. **Document Updates** - Record what changed and why

## When to Use

- Applying review-multi recommendations
- Implementing user feedback
- Enhancing skill based on skill-reviewer findings
- Systematic improvements across skills
- Version updates (v1.0 → v1.1)

## Update Workflow

### Step 1: Plan Updates

**Process**:
1. Gather improvement recommendations (from reviews, feedback)
2. Prioritize: Critical → High → Medium → Low
3. Estimate effort per improvement
4. Plan update sequence
5. Set success criteria

---

### Step 2: Backup Skill

**Process**:
```bash
# Create backup
cp -r .claude/skills/skill-name .claude/skills/skill-name.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Or use git
git add .claude/skills/skill-name
git commit -m "Backup before updates"
```

---

### Step 3: Apply Changes

**Process**:
1. Start with highest priority
2. Make one improvement at a time
3. Test after each change
4. Mark as complete
5. Move to next

---

### Step 4: Validate Changes

**Process**:
1. Run skill-validator (structure, content, pattern)
2. Compare before/after (metrics, quality)
3. Test in real scenario (usability)
4. Verify no regressions

---

### Step 5: Document Updates

**Process**:
```markdown
## Updates Log
