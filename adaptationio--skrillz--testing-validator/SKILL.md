# Testing Validator

## Overview

testing-validator provides comprehensive functional testing for Claude Code skills, validating that skills actually work correctly in practice through systematic testing operations.

**Purpose**: Functional validation - ensure skills work correctly, not just look good

**The 5 Testing Operations**:
1. **Functional Testing** - Core skill functionality works as intended
2. **Example Validation** - All code/command examples execute successfully
3. **Integration Testing** - Skills work correctly with dependencies and compositions
4. **Regression Testing** - Updates don't break existing functionality
5. **Edge Case Testing** - Handles unusual scenarios and boundary conditions

**Complement to review-multi**:
- **review-multi**: Quality assessment (structure, content, patterns, usability) - "Is it good?"
- **testing-validator**: Functional validation (does it work, examples execute, integrations function) - "Does it work?"
- **Together**: Complete validation (quality + functionality)

**Key Benefits**:
- Automated example execution (catch broken examples)
- Integration validation (ensure skills compose correctly)
- Regression prevention (detect breaks from updates)
- Edge case coverage (handle unusual scenarios)
- Systematic testing (consistent, repeatable)

## When to Use

Use testing-validator when:

1. **Pre-Deployment Testing** - Validate functionality before release
2. **Example Validation** - Ensure all examples execute correctly
3. **Integration Validation** - Test workflow skills and dependencies
4. **Post-Update Testing** - Regression testing after changes
5. **Comprehensive QA** - Combined with review-multi for complete validation
6. **CI/CD Integration** - Automated testing in pipelines
7. **Edge Case Validation** - Test boundary conditions and unusual scenarios
8. **Functional Certification** - Certify skills work correctly in practice

### Operation 4: Regression Testing

**Purpose**: Ensure updates don't break existing functionality

**When to Use This Operation**:
- After skill updates or improvements
- Before deploying changes
- Validating skill-updater changes
- Post-auto-updater verification

**Automation Level**: 60% automated (comparison, example re-execution), 40% manual

**Process**:

1. **Establish Baseline**
   - Before changes: run tests, document results
   - Save baseline test results
   - Note which examples/scenarios work

2. **Apply Changes**
   - Make updates to skill
   - Document what changed

3. **Re-Run Tests**
   - Re-execute same tests as baseline
   - Run example validation again
   - Test same scenarios

4. **Compare Results**
   - Before vs After comparison
   - Which tests changed status?
   - New failures? (regressions)
   - New successes? (improvements)
   - Unchanged? (stable)

5. **Identify Regressions**
   - Tests that passed before but fail now
   - Functionality that worked but now broken
   - Examples that executed but now error

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Baseline tests documented (before changes)
- [ ] Changes applied and documented
- [ ] All baseline tests re-executed
- [ ] Results compared (before vs after)
- [ ] No new failures (no regressions)
- [ ] If failures: identified and documented
- [ ] Regression fixes applied (if needed)
- [ ] Final validation: all tests pass

**Test Results**:
- **PASS**: No regressions (all baseline tests still pass)
- **REGRESSION**: Some tests failed that previously passed
- **IMPROVED**: Some tests pass that previously failed (plus no regressions)

**Outputs**:
- Regression test report
- Before/after comparison
- Identified regressions (if any)
- Regression fixes (if applicable)
- Final test status

**Time Estimate**: 30-60 minutes

**Example**:
```

   - Boundary conditions (limits, thresholds)

2. **Design Edge Case Tests**
   - Create test scenarios for each edge case
   - Define expected behavior
   - Document pass criteria

3. **Execute Edge Case Tests**
   - Test with empty/minimal inputs
   - Test with maximum/excessive inputs
   - Test with invalid/malformed inputs
   - Test with missing dependencies
   - Test boundary conditions

4. **Evaluate Handling**
   - Does skill handle edge case gracefully?
   - Error messages clear and helpful?
   - No crashes or undefined behavior?
   - Appropriate fallbacks or defaults?

5. **Document Edge Case Behavior**
   - Which edge cases handled well?
   - Which edge cases cause issues?
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Recommendations for improvement

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Edge cases identified (minimum 3-5)
- [ ] Each edge case tested
- [ ] Error handling assessed
- [ ] No crashes or undefined behavior
- [ ] Error messages helpful (if applicable)
- [ ] Graceful degradation (if applicable)
- [ ] Edge case handling documented

1. Empty task list (initialize with 0 tasks)
2. Single task (minimal usage)
3. 100+ tasks (maximum usage)
4. Starting non-existent task
5. Completing already completed task

Edge Case Tests:

Test 1: Empty Task List
- Scenario: Initialize with empty list
- Execution: todo-management Operation 1 with 0 tasks
- Result: ✅ PASS (handles gracefully, shows empty state)
- Error: None

Test 2: Single Task
- Scenario: List with 1 task only
- Execution: Complete workflow on 1 task
- Result: ✅ PASS (works correctly, minimal case handled)

## Testing Modes

### Comprehensive Testing Mode

**Purpose**: Complete functional validation across all 5 operations

**When to Use**:
- Pre-deployment (ensure everything works)
- Major updates (comprehensive regression testing)
- Quality certification (complete functional validation)

**Process**:
1. Run all 5 testing operations
2. Aggregate results
3. Generate comprehensive test report
4. Make deployment decision

**Time Estimate**: 2-4 hours

**Output**: Complete test report with PASS/FAIL for deployment

---

### Quick Check Mode

**Purpose**: Fast functional validation (examples only)

**When to Use**:
- During development (continuous testing)
- Quick validation (examples work?)
- Pre-commit checks

**Process**:
1. Run Operation 2 only (Example Validation)
2. Automated execution of all examples
3. Quick pass/fail report

**Time Estimate**: 15-30 minutes (automated)

**Output**: Example validation results

---

### Custom Testing Mode

**Purpose**: Select specific operations based on needs

**When to Use**:
- Targeted testing (only certain aspects)
- Time constraints (can't do comprehensive)
- Specific concerns (e.g., only integration testing)

**Process**:
1. Select operations to run (1-5)
2. Execute selected tests
3. Generate targeted report

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Early and Often
**Practice**: Run Quick Check during development, Comprehensive before deployment

**Rationale**: Early testing catches issues before they compound

**Application**: Quick Check daily, Comprehensive pre-deploy

### 2. Automate Example Validation
**Practice**: Use automated example validation (validate-examples.py)

**Rationale**: 80% automated, fast, catches broken examples instantly

**Application**: Run after any example changes

### 3. Test Real Scenarios
**Practice**: Use actual use cases for functional testing

**Rationale**: Real scenarios reveal issues documentation review misses

**Application**: Test scenarios from "When to Use" section

### 4. Regression Test After Updates
**Practice**: Always run regression tests after skill changes

**Rationale**: Prevents breaking existing functionality with improvements

**Application**: Before/after comparison for all updates

### 5. Document Test Results
**Practice**: Save test reports for comparison over time

**Rationale**: Track testing trends, identify patterns

**Application**: Generate test report for each comprehensive test

### 6. Fix Broken Examples Immediately
**Practice**: Don't deploy with broken examples

**Rationale**: Broken examples destroy user confidence

**Application**: Example validation must PASS before deploy

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Skipping Example Validation
**Symptom**: Users report broken examples after deployment

**Cause**: Not testing examples before release

**Fix**: Run Operation 2 (Example Validation) before every deployment

**Prevention**: Make example validation mandatory in deployment checklist

### Mistake 2: Only Testing Happy Path
**Symptom**: Skills break with unusual inputs or edge cases

**Cause**: Not testing edge cases

**Fix**: Run Operation 5 (Edge Case Testing)

**Prevention**: Include edge case testing in comprehensive mode

### Mistake 3: No Regression Testing
**Symptom**: Updates break previously working functionality

**Cause**: Not testing before/after updates

**Fix**: Run Operation 4 (Regression Testing) after changes

**Prevention**: Make regression testing mandatory for all updates

### Mistake 4: Not Testing Integrations
**Symptom**: Workflow skills break when actually composing other skills

**Cause**: Testing skills individually, not integrated

**Fix**: Run Operation 3 (Integration Testing) for workflow skills

**Prevention**: Always test integrations for workflow/composition skills

### Mistake 5: Manual Testing Only
**Symptom**: Testing takes too long, often skipped

**Cause**: Not using automation

**Fix**: Use validate-examples.py for automated example checking

**Prevention**: Automate where possible (examples, scripts, structure)

review-multi: Is it good? (structure, content, patterns, usability)
testing-validator: Does it work? (functional, examples, integration)

Together: Ready to deploy? (quality + functionality validated)
```

### Automation Scripts

```bash
# Validate all examples automatically
python3 scripts/validate-examples.py /path/to/skill

# Run comprehensive test suite
python3 scripts/test-runner.py /path/to/skill --mode comprehensive

# Generate test report
python3 scripts/generate-test-report.py test-results.json --output report.md
```
