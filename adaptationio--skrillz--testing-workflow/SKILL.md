# Testing Workflow

## Overview

testing-workflow provides comprehensive skill testing by orchestrating skill-tester operations with validation checks.

**Component Skills**:
- **skill-tester** (all 4 operations)
- **skill-validator** (validation checks)

**Workflow** (4 steps):
1. **Example Validation** - All examples execute correctly
2. **Scenario Testing** - Test in real-world use cases
3. **Integration Testing** - Test with other skills
4. **Validation Check** - Ensure tests didn't reveal structural issues

**Result**: Complete functional validation ensuring skill works correctly

## When to Use

- Pre-deployment functional testing
- After implementing new features
- Validating examples and documentation
- Integration validation for workflow skills

## Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Example Validation
Extract and execute all examples from skill, verify they work correctly.

**Time**: 15-30 minutes

---

### Step 2: Scenario Testing
Test skill in 2-3 realistic scenarios from "When to Use" section.

**Time**: 30-90 minutes

---

### Step 3: Integration Testing
Test skill works with other skills it depends on or composes.

**Time**: 20-45 minutes (if applicable)

---

### Step 4: Validation Check
Run skill-validator to ensure tests didn't reveal structure issues.

**Time**: 10-15 minutes

## Quick Reference

| Step | Focus | Time | Pass Criteria |
|------|-------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Examples | 15-30m | All examples execute correctly |
| 2 | Scenarios | 30-90m | Scenarios complete successfully |
| 3 | Integration | 20-45m | Integration smooth (if applicable) |
| 4 | Validation | 10-15m | Structure still passes |

**Total Time**: 1.5-3 hours

**Result**: ✅ TESTS PASS or ❌ TESTS FAIL (with issues to fix)
