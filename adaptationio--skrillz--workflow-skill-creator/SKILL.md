# Workflow Skill Creator

## Overview

workflow-skill-creator provides a systematic workflow for composing multiple existing skills into integrated workflows. It enables creating higher-level skills that orchestrate sequences of other skills, manage dependencies, and automate complex multi-step processes.

**Purpose**: Build workflow skills that compose and orchestrate existing skills

**Pattern**: Workflow-based (5-step process)

**Key Benefit**: Transform multiple standalone skills into cohesive, automated workflows

## When to Use

Use workflow-skill-creator when:
- Building complex multi-step processes
- Orchestrating multiple existing skills
- Creating end-to-end automation workflows
- Standardizing common skill sequences
- Building domain-specific workflow skills
- Automating repetitive multi-skill tasks

## Prerequisites

Before creating workflow skills:
- **Existing skills**: Have 2+ skills to compose
- **Clear goal**: Know the workflow objective
- **Dependencies understood**: Know skill execution order
- **Integration points**: Understand skill inputs/outputs

## Workflow Composition Process

### Step 1: Identify Component Skills

Determine which existing skills will be composed into the workflow.

**What to Identify**:

1. **Workflow Objective**:
   - What does the workflow accomplish end-to-end?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Who will use it?
   - What's the expected outcome?

2. **Required Capabilities**:
   - What actions are needed?
   - What expertise is required?
   - What tools must be used?
   - What validations are needed?

3. **Candidate Skills**:
   - Which existing skills provide needed capabilities?
   - Are all required skills available?
   - Are some skills missing (need to build)?
   - Are some skills optional (nice-to-have)?

4. **Skill Assessment**:
   - Does each skill do exactly what's needed?
   - Are skills well-documented?
   - Are skills tested and reliable?
   - Are there alternative skills?

**Assessment Template**:

```markdown
# Workflow: [Name]

## Objective:
[What the workflow accomplishes]

## Required Capabilities:
1. [Capability 1]: [What's needed]
2. [Capability 2]: [What's needed]

   - How is data passed between skills?
   - Where is intermediate data stored?

3. **Decision Points**:
   - Where are conditional branches?
   - What determines the path taken?
   - What happens on success vs. failure?
   - Are there loops or iterations?

4. **Error Handling**:
   - What can go wrong in each skill?
   - How should errors be handled?
   - Should workflow continue or stop on error?
   - Are there recovery strategies?

**Dependency Mapping Template**:

```markdown
# Workflow Dependencies: [Name]

## Execution Flow:

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
- **Skill**: [skill-name]
- **Depends On**: [prerequisite skills or "None"]
- **Produces**: [output data/files]
- **Used By**: [subsequent skills]
- **Can Parallelize**: Yes/No

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
[Same structure]

## Data Flow Diagram:

```
[Skill 1] --[output 1]--> [Skill 2] --[output 2]--> [Skill 3]
                             |
                             +--[output 2a]--> [Skill 4]
```

## Decision Points:

**Decision 1**: [After Skill X]
- **Condition**: [What determines path]
- **Path A**: [If condition true] → [Next skill]
- **Path B**: [If condition false] → [Alternative skill]

## Error Handling:

**Skill X Error**:

**Integration Method**: Guided execution

**Inputs**:
- skill-plan.md (workflow steps or operations)
- task-list.md (if available)

**Process**:
1. Identify each workflow step or operation that needs a prompt
2. For each prompt, invoke prompt-builder workflow:
   a. Understand Context (goal, audience, situation)
   b. Define Task Clearly (action verb, object, criteria)
   c. Structure Prompt (template, format)
   d. Add Context & Examples (background, patterns)
   e. Refine & Validate (quality check, score ≥4)
3. Collect all prompts
4. Review for consistency

**Outputs**:

   b. Complete Task (mark as completed)
   c. Report Progress (generate status reports)
   d. Identify Blockers (document obstacles)
   e. Update Estimates (track actuals vs estimates)
   f. Handle Task Changes (add/remove/modify)
   g. Maintain Momentum (ensure progress)
3. Continue until all tasks completed

**Outputs**:
- todos.md: Real-time task status
- progress-reports/: Status reports generated
- completion-summary.md: Final summary with actuals

**Validation**:
- [ ] Todo list initialized
- [ ] Tasks tracked in real-time
- [ ] Progress reports generated
- [ ] Blockers identified and addressed
- [ ] All tasks completed

**Next**: Skill implementation complete

## User Experience:

**Automation Level**: Semi-automated (user invokes each step, skills execute within)

**User Touchpoints**:
- Start: User defines research goal and skill objective
- Step 1: User reviews research findings, confirms patterns
- Step 2: User reviews skill plan, approves structure
- Step 3: User reviews task breakdown (if used)
- Step 4: User reviews prompts, confirms quality
- Step 5: User implements skill while tracking progress
- End: User has complete, tested skill

**Progress Visibility**:
- Each step shows completion status
- Step 5 (todo-management) provides continuous progress updates
- User always knows current phase and next action

## Error Handling Strategy:

**Error: Insufficient Research Findings**
- **Detection**: Step 1 synthesis has <3 sources
- **Response**: Workflow suggests additional research
- **User Action**: Conduct more research or proceed with limited information

**Error: Unclear Requirements**
- **Detection**: Step 2 planning cannot define clear scope
- **Response**: Workflow stops, requests clarification
- **User Action**: Provide more detail about skill objective

**Error: Task Estimates Wildly Off**
- **Detection**: Step 5 shows actual times >>estimates
- **Response**: Workflow notes learning opportunity
- **User Action**: Update estimates for future reference

**Error: Blocker in Implementation**
- **Detection**: Step 5 task marked as blocked
- **Response**: Workflow flags blocker, suggests resolution strategies
- **User Action**: Address blocker or escalate
```

**Design Principles**:

1. **Clarity First**:
   - Each step has clear purpose
   - Inputs/outputs explicit
   - Transitions obvious

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Optional steps where appropriate
   - Multiple paths allowed
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Visibility**:
   - Progress always visible
   - User knows next action
   - Errors clearly communicated

4. **Composability**:
   - Skills remain independent
   - Workflow orchestrates, doesn't replace
   - Can use skills individually if needed

**Validation**:
- [ ] Pattern chosen (workflow/task-based)
- [ ] SKILL.md structure designed
- [ ] Each step/operation specified
- [ ] Integration methods defined
- [ ] User experience mapped
- [ ] Error handling planned

→ **Output**: Complete workflow structure design

→ **Next**: Implement the workflow skill

# Skill Development Workflow

## Overview

skill-development-workflow provides a complete end-to-end process for developing Claude Code skills. It orchestrates five component skills (skill-researcher, planning-architect, task-development, prompt-builder, todo-management) into a cohesive workflow that takes you from initial concept to validated, production-ready skill.

**Purpose**: Systematic, research-driven skill development

**Pattern**: Workflow-based (5-step process)

**Key Benefit**: Comprehensive skill development using proven best practices

## When to Use

Use skill-development-workflow when:
- Building a new Claude Code skill from scratch
- Want to follow systematic, research-driven approach
- Need to ensure quality through structured process
- Building complex workflows or orchestrations
- Want to leverage existing toolkit skills

## Prerequisites

Before starting this workflow:
- **Clear objective**: Know what skill you want to build
- **Component skills available**: skill-researcher, planning-architect, task-development, prompt-builder, todo-management
- **Time allocated**: 4-8 hours for complete workflow
- **Implementation time**: Additional time to actually build the skill

[Full step content as designed in Step 3...]

### Step 4: Create High-Quality Prompts

[Full step content as designed in Step 3...]

### Step 5: Track Implementation Progress

[Full step content as designed in Step 3...]

## Best Practices

1. **Research First**: Always start with research, don't skip
   - Grounds skill in proven patterns
   - Discovers existing solutions
   - Validates approach

2. **Plan Before Building**: Complete planning before implementation
   - Prevents rework
   - Ensures coherent structure
   - Identifies gaps early

3. **Use All Steps**: Don't skip steps (except optional Step 3 for simple skills)
   - Each step builds on previous
   - Compound benefits
   - Higher quality outcome

4. **Track Progress**: Use todo-management throughout
   - Maintains momentum
   - Identifies blockers early
   - Ensures completion

5. **Iterate Prompts**: Spend time on Step 4 prompt quality
   - Better prompts = better skill
   - Validation prevents issues
   - Consistency improves usability

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Skipping Research
**Problem**: Building skill without understanding patterns, reinventing solutions
**Fix**: Always complete Step 1 research, minimum 3-5 sources

### Mistake 2: Vague Planning
**Problem**: Starting implementation without clear structure
**Fix**: Complete Step 2 fully, validate plan before proceeding

### Mistake 3: Poor Prompt Quality
**Problem**: Using first-draft prompts without validation
**Fix**: Use Step 4 prompt-builder, ensure all prompts score ≥4

### Mistake 4: No Progress Tracking
**Problem**: Losing momentum, tasks incomplete, blockers unaddressed
**Fix**: Use Step 5 todo-management continuously throughout implementation

### Mistake 5: Trying to Do Everything at Once
**Problem**: Attempting all steps simultaneously, getting overwhelmed
**Fix**: Follow sequential workflow, complete each step before next

- Multiple invocations (one per prompt)
- Quality-critical step

**todo-management** (Step 5):
- Used continuously during implementation
- Started after task breakdown (or simple task list)
- Runs until skill complete

### When to Use Individually:

You can use component skills individually outside this workflow:
- skill-researcher: Any research need
- planning-architect: Planning any skill
- task-development: Breaking down any work
- prompt-builder: Creating any prompt
- todo-management: Tracking any task list

This workflow orchestrates them for complete skill development.

## Best Practices

### Workflow Composition

**1. Start Simple**:
- Compose 2-3 skills first
- Add complexity gradually
- Test at each stage
- Validate benefits

**2. Maintain Independence**:
- Component skills remain usable individually
- Workflow orchestrates, doesn't replace
- Loose coupling
- Clear interfaces

**3. Design for Users**:
- Clear transitions
- Obvious next steps
- Helpful examples
- Error guidance

**4. Document Thoroughly**:
- Why each component skill?
- How do they integrate?
- What are tradeoffs?
- When to use alternatives?

**5. Test Rigorously**:
- Dry run first
- Test components
- Test integration
- Test with users

### Integration Patterns

**Sequential Workflows**:
```
Skill A → Skill B → Skill C
```
- Each step completes before next
- Clear dependencies
- Predictable flow

**Parallel Workflows**:
```
    ┌→ Skill B ┐
Skill A         → Skill D
    └→ Skill C ┘
```
- Independent skills run together
- Efficiency gains
- Requires coordination

**Conditional Workflows**:
```
Skill A
  ↓
[Decision]
  ├─ Path 1 → Skill B
  └─ Path 2 → Skill C
```
- Branches based on conditions
- Flexible workflows
- Handle variations

**Iterative Workflows**:
```
Skill A → Skill B → Skill C
            ↑         ↓
            └─[Loop]──┘
```
- Repeat until condition met
- Continuous improvement
- Progressive refinement

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Over-Orchestration

**Problem**: Workflow too rigid, removes flexibility
- Forces specific tool/approach
- Prevents adaptation
- Reduces usability

**Fix**: Keep workflows flexible
- Allow optional steps
- Permit alternative paths
- Enable partial execution

### Mistake 2: Under-Documentation

**Problem**: Users don't understand how skills compose
- Missing integration explanations
- No examples
- Unclear benefits

**Fix**: Document thoroughly
- Explain each composition
- Show concrete examples
- Clarify value proposition

### Mistake 3: Tight Coupling

**Problem**: Workflow breaks if component skill changes
- Hard dependencies
- Fragile integration
- Difficult maintenance

**Fix**: Loose coupling
- Document interfaces, not implementations
- Allow substitutions
- Version compatibility notes

### Mistake 4: No Error Handling

**Problem**: Workflow fails silently or ungracefully
- No recovery strategies
- Unclear error messages
- Workflow stops without guidance

**Fix**: Plan error handling
- Define error responses
- Provide recovery paths
- Give clear guidance

### Mistake 5: Skipping Validation

**Problem**: Workflow released without testing
- Hidden bugs
- Poor usability
- User frustration

**Fix**: Test thoroughly
- Dry run
- Component testing
- Integration testing
- User testing

## Integration with Other Skills

**Flow**: design workflow → build prompts for steps → implement workflow

## Quick Reference

### The 5-Step Process

1. **Identify Component Skills**: What skills to compose?
2. **Map Dependencies & Flow**: How do skills relate?
3. **Design Workflow Structure**: What's the architecture?
4. **Implement Composition**: Write SKILL.md and files
5. **Test & Validate**: Does it work?
