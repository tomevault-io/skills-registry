# GKE Cluster Configuration

## When to Use This Skill

This section covers the foundational security configurations for GKE clusters:

1. **[Private GKE Cluster](private-cluster.md)** - Private control plane, VPC networking, and encrypted etcd
2. **[Workload Identity](workload-identity.md)** - Pod-to-GCP authentication without service account keys
3. **[Binary Authorization](binary-authorization.md)** - Shielded Nodes and image verification

> **Public Cluster Risk**
>
>
> Public control planes expose your cluster API to the internet. Even with strong authentication, this increases attack surface and is not recommended for production.


## Prerequisites

- GCP project with billing enabled
- `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated
- Terraform 1.0+
- kubectl configured for cluster access
- Appropriate IAM permissions (Project Editor or Security Admin roles)

> **Production Warning**
>
>
> These configurations enforce strict security controls. Test in QAC/DEV before production deployment.


## Implementation

Fundamental cluster security configuration covering private networking, identity federation, and image verification.

## Overview

This section covers the foundational security configurations for GKE clusters:

1. **[Private GKE Cluster](private-cluster.md)** - Private control plane, VPC networking, and encrypted etcd
2. **[Workload Identity](workload-identity.md)** - Pod-to-GCP authentication without service account keys
3. **[Binary Authorization](binary-authorization.md)** - Shielded Nodes and image verification

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

- **Private Control Plane**: API server accessible only from authorized networks
- **Workload Identity**: Pods authenticate to GCP without static credentials
- **Shielded Nodes**: Secure boot, measured boot, and integrity monitoring
- **Binary Authorization**: Only verified container images run on the cluster

### Configuration Management

All configurations use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code, enabling:

- Repeatable deployments across environments
- Version-controlled security policies
- Automated compliance validation
- Drift detection and remediation

## Prerequisites

- GCP project with billing enabled
- `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated
- Terraform 1.0+
- kubectl configured for cluster access
- Appropriate IAM permissions (Project Editor or Security Admin roles)
