# Go CLI Architecture

## When to Use This Skill

> **Go vs Shell Scripts**
>
>
> Start with shell scripts for prototyping. Graduate to Go when you need type safety, testability, or complex orchestration logic.
>

**Use Go when you need:**

- Direct Kubernetes API access with type-safe clients
- Complex orchestration logic across multiple resources
- Reusable tooling packaged as container images
- Performance-critical operations (milliseconds matter)
- Long-running controllers or operators

**Use shell scripts when you need:**

- Simple glue logic between existing tools
- Quick prototypes or one-off operations
- kubectl-based workflows without custom logic
- CI/CD steps that primarily call other CLIs

## Implementation

See the full implementation guide in the [source documentation](https://adaptive-enforcement-lab.com/build/go-cli-architecture/).


## Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| **[Separation of concerns](../../patterns/architecture/separation-of-concerns/index.md)** | Commands handle CLI logic; `pkg/` handles business logic |
| **[Testable by default](testing/index.md)** | Interfaces for external dependencies enable fake clients |
| **[Fail fast](../../patterns/error-handling/fail-fast/index.md)** | Validate configuration and connectivity before operations |
| **[Structured output](command-architecture/io-contracts.md)** | JSON output for machine consumption, human-friendly by default |
| **[Graceful degradation](../../patterns/error-handling/graceful-degradation/index.md)** | Clear error messages with actionable context |
