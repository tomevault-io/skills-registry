# IAM Configuration

## When to Use This Skill

This section covers identity and access management for GKE clusters:

- **Service Account Roles**: Fine-grained IAM permissions for nodes, admins, and developers
- **Workload Identity Federation**: External identity provider integration (GitHub, OIDC)
- **Audit Logging**: Complete visibility into cluster management and API access


## Prerequisites

- GCP project with billing enabled
- Terraform 1.0+
- Appropriate IAM permissions (Security Admin or Project Editor)


## Implementation

Identity and access management controls who can do what in your cluster. Least-privilege service accounts minimize blast radius. Workload Identity Federation enables external identity integration. Audit logging provides complete visibility.

## Overview

This section covers identity and access management for GKE clusters:

- **Service Account Roles**: Fine-grained IAM permissions for nodes, admins, and developers
- **Workload Identity Federation**: External identity provider integration (GitHub, OIDC)
- **Audit Logging**: Complete visibility into cluster management and API access

## Security Principles

### Least Privilege

Grant only the minimum IAM roles required for each service account:

- Node service accounts: Logging, monitoring only
- Application service accounts: Specific GCP resource access
- Developer accounts: Read-only cluster access
- Admin accounts: Full cluster management (limited users)

### External Identity Integration

Workload Identity Federation enables pods and external systems to authenticate without static credentials:

- GitHub Actions: OIDC token exchange
- External CI/CD: Custom identity providers
- Multi-cloud workloads: Cross-cloud authentication

### Complete Audit Trail

Comprehensive audit logging captures all cluster activity:

- API server requests (create, update, delete)
- Authentication attempts and failures
- IAM policy changes
- Service account usage

## Prerequisites

- GCP project with billing enabled
- Terraform 1.0+
- Appropriate IAM permissions (Security Admin or Project Editor)
