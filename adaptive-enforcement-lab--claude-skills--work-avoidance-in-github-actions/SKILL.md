# Work Avoidance in GitHub Actions

## When to Use This Skill

Apply [work avoidance patterns](../../../../patterns/efficiency/work-avoidance/index.md) to skip unnecessary CI/CD operations.

> **Skip Before Execute**
>
> Detect unchanged content, cached builds, and irrelevant paths before running expensive operations.
>

## When to Apply

Work avoidance is valuable in GitHub Actions when:

- **Distribution workflows** push files to many repositories
- **Release automation** bumps versions without content changes
- **Scheduled jobs** run regardless of whether work exists
- **Monorepo builds** trigger on any change but only need subset builds

## Implementation

| Pattern | Operator Manual | Engineering Pattern |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Skip version-only changes | [Content Comparison](content-comparison.md) | [Volatile Field Exclusion](../../../../patterns/efficiency/work-avoidance/techniques/volatile-field-exclusion.md) |
| Skip unchanged paths | [Path Filtering](path-filtering.md) | N/A (native GitHub feature) |
| Skip cached builds | [Cache-Based Skip](cache-based-skip.md) | [Cache-Based Skip](../../../../patterns/efficiency/work-avoidance/techniques/cache-based-skip.md) |

## Quick Reference

### Check for Meaningful Changes


*See [examples.md](examples.md) for detailed code examples.*

### Path-Based Filtering

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
      - 'package.json'
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'
      - 'docs/**'
```

### Cache-Based Skip


*See [examples.md](examples.md) for detailed code examples.*
