# Doc Author - Technical Writing Orchestrator

Manage the full lifecycle of a documentation task by coordinating specialized skills. Accept any input — a Jira task, feature spec, verbal description, or development task — and produce a reviewed, polished draft.

## Core Principle

This skill orchestrates other skills. It does NOT duplicate their logic. Each phase invokes the appropriate skill and passes its output to the next phase. When a skill produces output, trust it and build on it — don't redo its work.

## Input Acceptance

Accept any of these as a starting input:
- **Jira task description** (pasted or via MCP)
- **Feature spec or PRD**
- **Verbal description** ("We added X to Y")
- **Development task** ("We shipped PR #123 that adds...")
- **Diff or PR reference**
- **Vague request** ("Document the new onboarding feature")

If the input is too vague to determine what changed, who it affects, or where it lives in the product — ask clarifying questions before proceeding. Otherwise, move to Phase 1.

## Workflow

> **Rule:** Each phase invokes a sub-skill via the Skill tool. Never substitute your own knowledge for an invoked skill — trust the skill's output and build on it.

### Phase 1: Plan — `writing-planner`

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use the Skill tool to invoke `writing-planner`.

The writing-planner will:
1. Parse the input and extract what changed
2. Research affected articles and existing content
3. Assess documentation scope (small / medium / large)
4. Interview the user for details it can't infer
5. Produce a documentation plan

**Your role in this phase:**
- Pass the user's input to writing-planner
- Let writing-planner drive the conversation — don't duplicate its questions
- When writing-planner produces a plan, present it to the user for approval

**Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until the user explicitly approves the plan.**

After approval, ask the user: "Ready to start drafting, or do you want to adjust anything first?"

### Phase 2: Draft — `editor`

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use the Skill tool to invoke `editor` in **write mode**.

Pass the approved plan as input. The editor will:
1. Research existing patterns in neighboring articles
2. Write content following STE rules, Astro/MDX conventions, and the approved plan
3. Self-review the draft against its checklist

**Your role in this phase:**
- Pass the approved plan from Phase 1 to the editor
- Skip the editor's own planning phases (Phases 1-3) since the writing-planner already produced the plan — go straight to writing (Phase 4) and self-review (Phase 5)
- If the draft requires code snippets, use the Skill tool to invoke `snippet-master`. See "Code snippets" below.
- Present the draft to the user

### Phase 3: Product Review — `product-manager`

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use the Skill tool to invoke `product-manager`.

The product-manager will evaluate:
1. Value clarity and positioning
2. Persona-based usage (developer, PM, marketer)
3. Technical accuracy of Adapty concepts
4. Onboarding effectiveness and adoption barriers
5. Mobile context awareness

**Your role in this phase:**
- Pass the written draft to the product-manager for review
- Collect the product-manager's feedback
- Apply improvements that align with both the product-manager's feedback and the editor's style rules
- If the product-manager and editor rules conflict (e.g., product-manager wants more context but editor's STE rules say keep it concise), favor the product-manager for content decisions and the editor for style execution. In practice: include the information the product-manager recommends, but write it in STE-compliant style.
- Present the improved draft to the user

### Phase 4: Feedback — Iterate with the User

Present the draft and ask for feedback. The user may:
- **Approve** → Done. Commit or finalize as appropriate.
- **Request changes** → Apply changes and re-present. If changes are substantial (new sections, restructured content), re-run the product-manager review on the changed sections.
- **Disagree with a skill's recommendation** → See "Skill Evolution" below.

Repeat this phase until the user approves.

### Phase 5: Skill Evolution (When Needed)

If user feedback at any phase contradicts a skill's instructions, evaluate whether the feedback represents:

**A one-off preference** (don't update the skill):
- "In this specific article, keep the intro shorter"
- "Skip the PM review for this small update"
- "Use a different heading style here because of [specific context]"

**A reproducible pattern** (update the skill):
- "Stop flagging X as an issue — it's always fine in our docs"
- "Always include Y in the intro — not just sometimes"
- "The product-manager should also check for Z"
- Style corrections that apply broadly: "We never use 'utilize' — add it to the banned words"
- Product corrections: "That's not how access levels work — update the product knowledge"

**When updating a skill:**
1. Tell the user what you're about to change and why
2. Read the current skill file using the Read tool (do NOT use `@` syntax)
3. Make a targeted edit — don't rewrite the whole skill
4. Show the user the change
5. If the change affects a reference file (e.g., `adapty-product-knowledge.md`), update that file instead of the main SKILL.md
6. For non-trivial skill changes (new sections, structural changes, behavior changes), use the Skill tool to invoke `superpowers:writing-skills` to guide the update properly

## Orchestration Rules

### Don't duplicate skill work
Each skill has deep expertise. Don't second-guess the writing-planner's scope assessment, the editor's STE compliance, or the product-manager's persona analysis. Trust their output and focus on stitching phases together.

### Keep the user in control
- Never auto-advance between phases. Always pause for user confirmation at phase boundaries.
- After Phase 1 (plan approved): Ask what to start with.
- After Phase 2 (draft ready): Present for review.
- After Phase 3 (PM review applied): Present the improved version.
- After Phase 4 (feedback applied): Check if the user is satisfied.

### Handle scope mismatches
If the writing-planner assesses a "small update" but the user's feedback keeps expanding scope, flag it: "This has grown beyond the original small update scope. Want me to re-plan as a medium update?" Re-invoke writing-planner if needed.

### Multi-article coordination
For tasks affecting multiple articles, the writing-planner will produce a multi-article plan with execution order. Follow that order. Draft each article separately through Phases 2-4, completing one before starting the next (unless the user prefers parallel drafting).

### Code snippets
When the plan or draft calls for code snippets, use the Skill tool to invoke `snippet-master`. **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `snippet-master` handles SDK code across all 7 platforms (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Kotlin Multiplatform, Capacitor) — don't write snippets yourself.
