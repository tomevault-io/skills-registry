# Snippet Master

Creates high-quality, consistent code snippets for technical documentation by finding relevant code in SDK repositories and adapting it according to documentation guidelines and best practices.

## Core Principles

1. **Context First**: Never create a snippet without understanding the article context and purpose
2. **Minimal Yet Complete**: Show only what's necessary, but provide enough context for clarity
3. **Consistency**: Match existing snippets on the same page in style and structure
4. **Best Practices**: Apply modern, idiomatic code patterns for each platform
5. **Real SDK Code**: Base snippets on actual SDK implementation, not invented examples

## Usage Modes

This skill supports three primary workflows:

### Mode 1: Creating from Scratch
Build new snippets by examining SDK code and applying platform-specific patterns.

### Mode 2: Cross-Platform Translation
Adapt existing snippets from one platform to another. This is often faster and ensures consistency across platforms.

### Mode 3: Reviewing Existing Snippets
Evaluate existing snippets for accuracy, best practices, consistency, and completeness. See the "Reviewing Existing Snippets" section below for the detailed review process.

**When translating:**
1. Start with the source platform's snippet as a reference
2. Check the target platform's SDK to verify API differences
3. Apply target platform's syntax and patterns
4. Keep the same example scenario/text unless platform-specific
5. Verify convenience methods exist on target platform

**Example Translation Flow:**
```
React Native snippet → Check Flutter SDK → Apply Flutter patterns → Flutter snippet
```

**What to translate directly:**
- Example text and scenario ("Close paywall?", "You will lose access...")
- Parameter values ("placement_id", "YOUR_ACCESS_LEVEL")
- Logic flow (check result, dismiss if secondary action)
- Comment style and placement

**What to adapt:**
- Syntax (TypeScript → Dart, Kotlin → Swift)
- Error handling pattern (try/catch → try/on AdaptyError/catch)
- Type names (AdaptyUIDialogActionType vs string literal)
- Method calls (check for convenience methods like `.present()`)

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Requirements (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

Before doing ANYTHING, you MUST collect all required information:

1. **Article Context**
    - Ask: "Which article/file should this snippet go in?"
    - Read the MDX file from `src/content/docs/[filename].mdx`
    - Understand: What section? What is being explained? What's the learning goal?

2. **Platform Information**
    - Ask: "Which platform(s)?" (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Kotlin Multiplatform, Capacitor)
    - Identify the corresponding SDK repo: `AdaptySDK-[platform]` (use `KMP` for Kotlin Multiplatform, `React-Native` for RN)

3. **What to Demonstrate**
    - Ask: "What specific functionality should the snippet show?"
    - Clarify: What SDK methods/classes are involved?
    - Understand: What's the minimum viable example that makes the point?

4. **Placement in Article**
    - Ask: "Where exactly in the article should this go?" (section name or approximate location)
    - Check: Are there existing snippets in that section?

**STOP HERE if any information is missing. Do not proceed until you have all 4 pieces.**

### Phase 2: Understand Context

1. **Read the Article**
   ```bash
   view src/content/docs/[article-name].mdx
   ```
    - What's being taught in this section?
    - What knowledge does the reader already have at this point?
    - What's the next step after this snippet?

2. **Analyze Existing Snippets** (if any exist on the page)
    - Style: How verbose are they? What level of detail?
    - Structure: How are variables named? How is error handling done?
    - Comments: What style of comments (if any)?
    - **Rule: Match the existing style - consistency on the page is more important than "ideal" style**

3. **Check Platform Guidelines**
    - Read `references/<platform>.md` for platform-specific patterns
    - Identify the idiomatic approach for this platform

### Phase 3: Find Real SDK Code

1. **Locate the SDK Repository**
    - Path: `../AdaptySDK-[platform]/` (adjust based on actual location)
    - Platforms: iOS, Android, React-Native, Flutter, Unity, KMP, Capacitor

2. **Search for Relevant Code**
   ```bash
   # Search for the method/class
   grep -r "methodName" ../AdaptySDK-[platform]/
   
   # Look at implementation
   view ../AdaptySDK-[platform]/path/to/file.swift
   ```

3. **Understand the Real API**
    - What parameters are required vs optional?
    - What does the response look like?
    - What errors can occur?
    - How is this actually used in the SDK?

### Phase 4: Create the Snippet

1. **Start Minimal**
    - Show ONLY what's necessary for the concept being taught
    - Every line must have a reason to exist

2. **Add Essential Context**
    - If showing a method call, show how parameters are constructed
    - Don't just write `Adapty.makePurchase(params)` - show where `params` comes from
    - Example:
      ```kotlin
      // BAD - no context
      Adapty.makePurchase(subscriptionUpdateParams)
      
      // GOOD - shows construction
      val subscriptionUpdateParams = AdaptySubscriptionUpdateParameters(
          oldSubVendorProductId = "old_product_id",
          replacementMode = AdaptySubscriptionUpdateReplacementMode.WITH_TIME_PRORATION
      )
      Adapty.makePurchase(subscriptionUpdateParams) { result ->
          // handle result
      }
      ```

3. **Apply Platform Idioms**
    - iOS: Use `async/await` with `do-catch`
    - Android: Use `AdaptyResult.Success/Error` pattern
    - React Native: Use `try/catch` with `async/await`
    - Flutter: Use `try/on AdaptyError/catch` pattern
    - Unity: Use callback pattern with null check
    - KMP: Use `onSuccess/onError` pattern
    - Capacitor: Use `try/catch` with `async/await`

4. **Add Appropriate Comments**
    - Use `// check the access` or `// handle the error` style
    - Keep comments brief and actionable
    - Match the comment style of existing snippets on the page

5. **Follow Best Practices**
    - Use modern language features (guard clauses, null safety, etc.)
    - Show proper error handling (always!)
    - Use descriptive variable names
    - Avoid magic strings - use meaningful placeholders like `"YOUR_ACCESS_LEVEL"`
    - Resource cleanup where relevant (dispose, close, etc.)

### Handling Multiple Approaches

When the SDK offers multiple ways to accomplish something (e.g., standalone screen vs embedded widget), follow this pattern:

1. **Document Structure**
   - Introduce all approaches at the beginning: "Adapty SDK provides two ways to X: Method A and Method B"
   - Present the simpler/more common approach first
   - Use H2 headers for each major approach
   - Use H3 headers for variations within an approach

2. **Progressive Detail**
   - Start with the minimal example (required parameters only)
   - Show variations with optional parameters in subsequent sections
   - Example structure:
     ```
     ## Present as standalone screen
     [minimal example with .present()]

     ### Dismiss the onboarding
     [show .dismiss()]

     ### Configure iOS presentation style
     [show optional iosPresentationStyle parameter]
     ```

3. **Use Tabs for Context Variants**
   - When showing the same concept in different contexts, use tabs
   - Example: Standalone vs Embedded, Kotlin vs Java
   ```markdown
   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="standalone" label="Standalone screen" default>
   [snippet for standalone]
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="embedded" label="Embedded widget">
   [snippet for embedded]
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
   ```

4. **Code Block Language Identifiers**
   - Use the actual language: `dart`, `kotlin`, `swift`, `typescript`, `csharp`
   - Sometimes use generic identifier with specific title: `javascript showLineNumbers title="Flutter"`
   - When in doubt, check similar files in the platform directory

5. **Convenience Methods vs Direct Calls**
   - Prefer convenience methods when available: `view.present()` over `AdaptyUI().presentView(view)`
   - This is cleaner and what developers naturally expect
   - The SDK code will show both, but docs prefer the simpler API

### Phase 5: Review and Refine

1. **Self-Review Checklist**
    - [ ] Does this match existing snippets on the page in style?
    - [ ] Is every line necessary for understanding?
    - [ ] Does it show enough context (parameter construction, etc.)?
    - [ ] Is error handling present and appropriate?
    - [ ] Are best practices followed for this platform?
    - [ ] Would an experienced dev in this language approve this code?
    - [ ] Is it minimal yet complete?
    - [ ] If multiple approaches exist, are they all documented with appropriate structure?

2. **Compare to Platform Style Guide**
    - Review `references/<platform>.md`
    - Ensure platform-specific patterns are correct

3. **Validate Against Real SDK**
    - Does this code actually work with the real SDK API?
    - Are method signatures correct?
    - Are parameter types accurate?
    - Check for convenience methods on returned objects (e.g., `.present()`, `.dismiss()`)

## Reviewing Existing Snippets

When asked to review existing snippets:

1. **Read the Article Context**
    - Understand what's being taught
    - Check if the snippet serves that purpose

2. **Check Against Criteria**
    - Consistency: Does it match other snippets on the page?
    - Completeness: Is context shown (parameter construction, etc.)?
    - Best Practices: Does it follow modern platform idioms?
    - Minimalism: Is every line necessary?
    - Accuracy: Does it match the real SDK API?

3. **Suggest Improvements**
    - Be specific about what to change and why
    - Show before/after examples
    - Explain the reasoning

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing Context**
    - ❌ `Adapty.makePurchase(params)`
    - ✅ Show how `params` is created

2. **Over-Commenting**
    - ❌ `// This line calls the getProfile method to retrieve the user's profile`
    - ✅ `// check the access`

3. **Inconsistency**
    - ❌ Using different error handling patterns on the same page
    - ✅ Match the established pattern

4. **No Error Handling**
    - ❌ Only showing the happy path
    - ✅ Always include error handling

5. **Outdated Patterns**
    - ❌ Using old APIs or deprecated patterns
    - ✅ Use modern, idiomatic code

6. **Too Much Code**
    - ❌ Showing entire class implementations
    - ✅ Show only the relevant method call and setup

## Platform Reference Files

Load the relevant file(s) from `references/` when working on a specific platform:

- `references/ios.md` — Swift async/await, do-catch, guard clauses
- `references/android.md` — AdaptyResult sealed class, when expressions
- `references/react-native.md` — TypeScript try/catch async/await
- `references/flutter.md` — Dart try/on AdaptyError/catch, pattern matching
- `references/unity.md` — C# callback pattern, null checks
- `references/kmp.md` — Kotlin onSuccess/onError chaining
- `references/capacitor.md` — TypeScript try/catch (like RN, adds console.log)
- `references/cross-platform.md` — Consistency rules, formatting, translation checklist
