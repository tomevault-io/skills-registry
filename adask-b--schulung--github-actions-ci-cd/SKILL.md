# GitHub Actions CI/CD

Follow this guide to set up automated testing and deployment pipelines:

## 1. Basic Workflow Structure

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Run tests
        run: pnpm test

      - name: Build
        run: pnpm build
```

## 2. Multi-Job Pipeline

```yaml
name: Full CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm lint
      - run: pnpm type-check

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm test:coverage

      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          files: ./coverage/coverage-final.json

  build:
    needs: [lint, test]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm build

      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build
          path: dist/

  deploy:
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build

      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deploy commands here
```

## 3. Environment Variables & Secrets

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      NODE_ENV: production

    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
        run: |
          echo "Deploying with secure credentials"
```

**Add secrets in GitHub:**
Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret

## 4. Matrix Strategy (Test Multiple Versions)

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18, 20, 22]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm test
```

## 5. Caching Dependencies

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Setup Node with cache
    uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '20'
      cache: 'pnpm'

  # Or manual caching
  - name: Cache node_modules
    uses: actions/cache@v3
    with:
      path: ~/.pnpm-store
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-
```

## 6. Conditional Steps

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run only on main branch
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    run: echo "Deploying to production"

  - name: Run only on PRs
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    run: echo "Running PR checks"

  - name: Run on success
    if: success()
    run: echo "Previous steps succeeded"

  - name: Run on failure
    if: failure()
    run: echo "Previous steps failed"
```

## 7. Deploy to Vercel

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-args: '--prod'
```

## 8. Docker Build & Push

```yaml
name: Docker Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: user/app:latest
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

## 9. E2E Tests with Playwright

```yaml
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Install Playwright
        run: pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: pnpm test:e2e

      - name: Upload test results
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## 10. Scheduled Workflows (Cron)

```yaml
name: Nightly Build

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *' # Every day at 2 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger

jobs:
  nightly:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm test
```

## 11. Reusable Workflows

```yaml
# .github/workflows/reusable-build.yml
name: Reusable Build

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      node-version:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
      - run: pnpm build

# Use it:
# .github/workflows/main.yml
jobs:
  build:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-build.yml
    with:
      node-version: '20'
```

## 12. Status Badges

Add to README.md:
```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/username/repo/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
```

## 13. Best Practices

- ✅ Use specific action versions (@v4, not @latest)
- ✅ Cache dependencies for faster builds
- ✅ Fail fast: Run quick checks (lint) before slow ones (tests)
- ✅ Use matrix strategy for multi-version testing
- ✅ Store secrets in GitHub Secrets
- ✅ Use workflow_dispatch for manual triggers
- ✅ Upload artifacts for failed builds (test reports, screenshots)
- ✅ Use concurrency to cancel old runs
- ❌ Don't commit secrets
- ❌ Don't use `if: always()` without good reason

## 14. Debugging Workflows

```yaml
- name: Debug
  run: |
    echo "Event: ${{ github.event_name }}"
    echo "Ref: ${{ github.ref }}"
    echo "SHA: ${{ github.sha }}"
    env
```

Enable debug logging:
Repository Settings → Secrets → Add: `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` = `true`
