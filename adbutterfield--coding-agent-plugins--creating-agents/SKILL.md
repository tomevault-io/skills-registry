# Creating Custom Claude Code Subagents

This skill guides you through designing and creating custom subagent configurations for Claude Code CLI.

## Official Documentation

For the most current information, reference:
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents

## When to Create a Custom Agent

**Use Built-in Agents When:**
- **Explore**: Fast, read-only codebase exploration (uses Haiku)
- **Plan**: Research and planning tasks
- **General-purpose**: Complex multi-step tasks with full capabilities
- **Bash**: Terminal commands in separate context

**Create Custom Agents When:**
- You need a specialized domain expert (code reviewer, data scientist, security auditor)
- You require specific tool restrictions for safety or focus
- You want custom hooks for validation or lifecycle events
- You need a focused system prompt for consistent behavior
- You want to share configurations with your team via version control

## Agent Design Process

### 1. Gather Requirements

Ask the user to clarify:
- What specific task should this agent handle?
- What tools does it need? What tools should it NOT have?
- Should this be user-level (all projects) or project-level?
- Does it need hooks for validation or setup/cleanup?

### 2. Choose Location

| Location | Path | Scope | Use Case |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| Project | `.claude/agents/` | Current project | Team-shared, version-controlled |
| User | `~/.claude/agents/` | All your projects | Personal preferences |
| Session | `--agents` CLI flag | Current session only | Temporary experimentation |

### 3. Write the Description (Critical!)

The description determines when Claude delegates to your agent. Write it like you're telling Claude: "Use this agent when..."

**Good descriptions:**
- "Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability"
- "Execute read-only database queries with SQL validation"
- "Debugging specialist for errors, test failures, and unexpected behavior"

**Bad descriptions:**
- "Code helper" (too vague)
- "Does stuff with files" (no trigger keywords)
- "My agent" (meaningless)

### 4. Configure Tool Access

Three approaches:
- **Inherit all** (default): Omit `tools` field entirely
- **Allowlist**: Use `tools` to specify only permitted tools
- **Denylist**: Use `disallowedTools` to remove specific tools

Common tool sets:
- **Read-only**: `Read, Grep, Glob, Bash`
- **With editing**: `Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob`
- **Minimal**: `Read, Grep, Glob` (no Bash)

### 5. Set Permission Mode

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `default` | Standard permission prompts |
| `acceptEdits` | Auto-accept file edits |
| `dontAsk` | Auto-deny permission prompts |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skip all checks (use cautiously) |
| `plan` | Read-only exploration mode |

### 6. Add Hooks (Optional)

Hooks enable validation or lifecycle events. See `./references/hooks-and-validation-patterns.md` for examples.

## Quick Configuration Reference

```yaml
---
name: my-agent                    # Required: lowercase, hyphens only
description: When to use this     # Required: determines delegation
model: sonnet                     # Optional: sonnet|opus|haiku|inherit
tools: Read, Grep, Glob           # Optional: allowlist (inherits all if omitted)
disallowedTools: Write, Edit      # Optional: denylist
permissionMode: default           # Optional: permission handling
skills: my-skill, other-skill     # Optional: preload skill context
hooks:                            # Optional: lifecycle hooks
  PreToolUse: [...]
  PostToolUse: [...]
---

Your system prompt goes here. This is the context and instructions
the agent receives when invoked.
```

For detailed field documentation, see `./references/agent-configuration-options.md`.

## Common Patterns

### Read-Only Reviewer
```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review specialist for quality, security, and maintainability
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: inherit
---

You are a senior code reviewer. Analyze code and provide specific, actionable feedback.
```

### Database Reader with Validation
```yaml
---
name: db-reader
description: Execute read-only database queries with SQL validation
tools: Bash
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh"
---

You execute SQL queries. Only SELECT statements are permitted.
```

### Focused Domain Specialist
```yaml
---
name: security-auditor
description: Security specialist for vulnerability assessment and secure coding review
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
disallowedTools: Edit, Write
---

You are a security expert. Focus on OWASP Top 10, authentication, authorization,
input validation, and secure data handling.
```

For more examples, see `./references/agent-examples.md`.

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing your agent:

- [ ] **Name**: Lowercase letters and hyphens only, unique identifier
- [ ] **Description**: Clear, specific, includes trigger keywords
- [ ] **Tools**: Minimally scoped for the task (principle of least privilege)
- [ ] **System prompt**: Focused instructions for the agent's role
- [ ] **Location**: Appropriate scope (project vs user)
- [ ] **Hooks**: If used, validation script tested and working

## Creating the Agent File

1. Create the file at the appropriate location:
   ```bash
   # Project-level (version-controlled)
   mkdir -p .claude/agents

   # User-level (personal)
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
   ```

2. Write the agent file with `.md` extension:
   ```bash
   # Example: .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md
   ```

3. Test by asking Claude to use the agent or let it auto-delegate based on description

## Using Agents

Once created, agents are available automatically:
- Claude delegates based on matching descriptions
- Explicitly invoke: "Use the code-reviewer agent to analyze this file"
- Manage via `/agents` command in Claude Code
