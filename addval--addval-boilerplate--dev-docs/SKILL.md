# Dev Docs

Persistent task documentation across context resets using the three-file Dev Docs pattern.

## Overview

Dev Docs provide a structured way to document complex tasks that span multiple sessions or context resets. They ensure continuity and prevent lost work.

## The Three-File Structure

```
dev/active/[task-name]/
├── [task-name]-plan.md      # Strategic plan with architecture
├── [task-name]-context.md   # Current progress and decisions
└── [task-name]-tasks.md     # Detailed task checklist
```

### File Purposes

**plan.md** - Strategic documentation
- High-level approach and architecture
- Key design decisions
- Implementation phases
- Success criteria

**context.md** - Session continuity
- Current progress tracking
- Key decisions made (with rationale)
- Important file references
- Session notes and progress

**tasks.md** - Execution checklist
- Detailed task breakdown
- Checkbox format for tracking
- Subtasks and dependencies
- Completion status

## When to Use Dev Docs

### ✅ Use Dev Docs for:
- Features requiring multiple sessions
- Complex refactoring with many files
- Multi-step architecture changes
- Tasks requiring careful planning
- Work that's likely to be interrupted

### ❌ Skip Dev Docs for:
- Simple bug fixes (single file)
- Quick updates (< 2 hours)
- Trivial changes
- Well-understood maintenance

**Rule of thumb:** If it takes more than 2 hours or spans multiple sessions, use dev docs.

## Creating Dev Docs

### Step 1: User invokes the skill

User says:
```
/dev-docs create [task description]
```

Example:
```
/dev-docs create implementing real-time notifications with WebSockets
```

### Step 2: Generate the three files

Create directory structure:
```bash
dev/active/[task-name]/
```

Generate the three files with appropriate content.

### Step 3: Review and adjust

User reviews the plan and suggests adjustments.

### Step 4: Start implementation

Begin working through tasks in `tasks.md`.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating Dev Docs

**User:**
```
/dev-docs create implementing WebSocket notifications
```

**Claude:**
1. Creates `dev/active/websocket-notifications/`
2. Generates three files with appropriate content
3. Presents plan for review

### Example 2: After Context Reset

**User:**
```
/dev-docs resume
```

**Claude:**
1. Reads all dev docs in `dev/active/`
2. Presents current status
3. Asks which task to continue

### Example 3: Updating Progress

**User:**
```
/dev-docs update I just completed the WebSocket server setup
```

**Claude:**
1. Updates `context.md` with session progress
2. Checks off completed tasks in `tasks.md`
3. Updates current phase and next steps

### Example 4: Archive Completed

**User:**
```
/dev-docs archive websocket-notifications
```

**Claude:**
1. Moves `dev/active/websocket-notifications/` to `dev/completed/`
2. Updates task status to complete
3. Removes from active tasks list

## Best Practices

### Writing Plans
- Start with clear objectives
- Break into logical phases
- Define success criteria upfront
- Document design decisions with rationale
- Consider risks and mitigations

### Maintaining Context
- Update after every session
- Record important decisions as they're made
- Note file locations for quick reference
- Document technical gotchas
- Keep next steps current

### Managing Tasks
- Break down into small, checkable items
- Use subtasks for complex work
- Mark complete immediately after finishing
- Update estimates as you learn
- Note dependencies clearly

### During Implementation
- Refer to plan.md for strategy
- Check tasks.md for what's next
- Update context.md frequently
- Don't skip updating progress
- Note blockers immediately

## Tips for Success

1. **Create early** - Set up dev docs when starting a complex task
2. **Update frequently** - Keep context.md current after every session
3. **Be specific** - Detailed notes are better than vague ones
4. **Track decisions** - Document the "why" not just the "what"
5. **Use checkboxes** - Check off tasks as you complete them
6. **Reference files** - Note important file locations for quick access
7. **Note blockers** - Record what's blocking you and potential solutions
8. **Plan next steps** - Always end a session with clear next steps
9. **Archive when done** - Move completed tasks to avoid clutter
10. **Review before resuming** - Read all three files after context reset

## Common Patterns

### Feature Implementation
```markdown
Plan: High-level architecture, API design, database schema
Context: Current phase, key decisions, files modified
Tasks: Backend API → Frontend UI → Testing → Documentation
```

### Refactoring
```markdown
Plan: Current problems, proposed solution, migration strategy
Context: Files refactored, breaking changes, test updates
Tasks: Identify scope → Refactor incrementally → Update tests → Verify
```

### Bug Fix Investigation
```markdown
Plan: Bug description, reproduction steps, investigation approach
Context: Findings, root cause analysis, potential solutions
Tasks: Reproduce → Investigate → Identify cause → Implement fix → Test
```

### Architecture Change
```markdown
Plan: Current limitations, proposed architecture, migration plan
Context: Design decisions, trade-offs, implementation notes
Tasks: Design → Implement new → Migrate data → Remove old → Test
```
