# Design Builder

Product-engineer design pipeline: discover, extract, structure, preview, approve.

## Workflow

```
discovery --> content --> tokens + validate --> structure --> preview --> design final
```

Each step is independent. Can run isolated or chained.
Discovery is always the first step -- never skip it.

Design final can be: HTML standalone, Paper/Pencil/Figma via MCP, or input
for spec-driven (implementation).

## Context Loading Strategy

Load only the reference matching the current trigger. For preview operations,
also load `aesthetics.md` and `web-standards.md` as auto-loaded dependencies.

**Never simultaneous:**
- Multiple operation references (e.g., copy.md + structure.md)

## Triggers

### Extraction

| Trigger Pattern | Reference |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Extract copy, copy from URL, content from website | [copy.md](references/copy.md) |
| Extract design, design from image, design tokens | [design.md](references/design.md) |

### Structure

| Trigger Pattern | Reference |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Wireframe, layout, structure, organize content | [structure.md](references/structure.md) |

### Preview

| Trigger Pattern | Reference |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Preview, variants, mockup, design review | [preview.md](references/preview.md) |

### Auto-Loaded (not direct triggers)

- `aesthetics.md` -- loaded by `preview.md` as design principles
- `web-standards.md` -- loaded by `preview.md` as implementation rules

## Cross-References

```
brainstorming ---------> design-builder (direction feeds discovery)
product-naming --------> design-builder (name feeds discovery)
copy.md ---------------> structure.md (content informs structure)
design.md -------------> structure.md (tokens inform visual hierarchy)
design.md -------------> preview.md (tokens style the preview)
structure.md ----------> preview.md (structure + tokens = preview)
aesthetics.md ---------> preview.md (design principles)
web-standards.md ------> preview.md (implementation rules)
design-builder --------> spec-driven (approved design feeds implementation)
```

## Discovery

Before any operation, establish project context.

### Step 1: Check Existing Context

Look for existing documents:

- `.artifacts/docs/prd.md` -- PRD
- `.artifacts/docs/brief.md` -- Brief
- `.artifacts/brainstorm/` -- brainstorming direction
- `.artifacts/docs/*-research.md` -- naming research

If found: read and extract purpose, audience, tone, and key features.
Skip to the relevant trigger operation.

### Step 2: Lightweight Discovery (when no context exists)

Ask one question at a time:

1. What is the project purpose? (landing page, app, tool, portfolio)
2. Who is the target audience?
3. What is the visual reference? (URLs, screenshots, descriptions)
4. Any brand or style constraints? (colors, fonts, existing guidelines)

If the user answers "I don't know" to any question, mark as TBD and move forward.
Summarize understanding before proceeding.

### Step 3: Route to Operation

**Phase 1 -- Extraction** (how to obtain design tokens):

```
Has URL reference?
  Yes --> Extract copy --> Extract design
  No  --> Has image reference?
    Yes --> Extract design
    No  --> Visual discovery (tone, colors, typography) --> Extract design
```

**Phase 2 -- Structure and Preview** (design the experience):

```
tokens + validate complete --> Structure --> Preview --> Design final
```

## Templates

| Context | Template |
|---------|----------|
| Copy extraction output | [copy.md](templates/copy.md) |
| Design tokens output | [design.md](templates/design.md) |

## Artifacts

```
.artifacts/design/
├── copy.yaml              # Structured content
├── design.json            # Design tokens (validated)
├── structure.md           # Layout decisions
└── preview/               # Preview session output
    ├── guided/            # Per-question decisions (guided mode)
    └── variants/          # 4 HTML variants (exploratory mode)
```

## Guidelines

**DO:**
- Ask user for project name and use kebab-case for directory names
- Check for existing context before any operation (PRD, brief, brainstorm, naming)
- Check for existing copy.yaml, design.json, structure.md before starting
- Suggest next steps after completing any operation
- Suggest missing prerequisites

**DON'T:**
- Skip discovery -- always establish project context first
- Ignore existing artifacts when they are available
- Block on missing PRD/Brief -- run lightweight discovery instead
- Skip structure -- even with wireframe, validate coherence

## Error Handling

- No PRD/Brief: Run lightweight discovery, never block on it
- No copy.yaml: Proceed without it, or suggest running extract copy first
- No design.json: Required for structure/preview -- suggest running extract design
- No structure.md: Required for preview -- suggest running structure first
- Reference URL unavailable: ask user to paste a screenshot instead
