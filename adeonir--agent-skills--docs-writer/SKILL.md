# Docs Writer

Generate structured documents through guided discovery. 6 document types, each with its own workflow depth.

## Workflow

```
trigger --> detect type --> load reference --> discovery --> drafting
```

Detect document type from the trigger. If ambiguous, ask the user which type they want.

## Context Loading Strategy

Load the reference and template matching the detected document type. For types that require discovery, also load [discovery.md](references/discovery.md).

**Never simultaneous:**
- Multiple document type references
- Templates for different document types

## Triggers

| Trigger Pattern | Type | Reference |
|-----------------|------|-----------|
| Create PRD, define product, product requirements, write PRD | PRD | [prd.md](references/prd.md) |
| Create RFC, propose change, request for comments | RFC | [rfc.md](references/rfc.md) |
| Create ADR, record decision, architecture decision | ADR | [adr.md](references/adr.md) |
| Create design doc, design system | Design Doc | [design.md](references/design.md) |
| Create TDD, technical design document, technical design | TDD | [tdd.md](references/tdd.md) |
| Create document, write doc | Ask user | -- |

## Cross-References

```
PRD -------------> Design Doc     (PRD feeds requirements, context into Design Doc)
PRD -------------> TDD            (PRD feeds requirements into TDD)
PRD -------------> epic-tracker   (PRD milestones and FRs inform epic definition)
PRD -------------> design-builder (PRD + Brief inform copy and design extraction)
PRD -------------> spec-driven    (PRD milestones feed spec initialization)
Design Doc ------> ADR            (design decisions generate ADRs)
TDD -------------> ADR            (TDD decisions generate ADRs)
RFC -------------> ADR            (accepted RFC generates ADR)
```

Notes:

- **epic-tracker**: PRD milestones and functional requirements feed epic planning -- epics, stories, and bugs are managed by epic-tracker
- **design-builder**: PRD sections 1, 3-4 (problem, personas, scope) and Brief (value prop, market) inform copy extraction and design extraction
- **spec-driven**: PRD milestones feed feature initialization -- each milestone can generate a spec with its own tasks
- **Design Doc**: When PRD exists, the Design Doc focuses on technical strategy; without PRD, it covers both product context and technical design. Use Design Doc for informal trade-off discussion.
- **TDD**: Prescriptive technical planning for specific components. A project can have both a Design Doc (system-level decisions) and TDDs (component-level technical plans).

## Document Types

| Type | Workflow | Reference | Template |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| PRD | discovery -> validation -> synthesis -> drafting | [prd.md](references/prd.md) | [prd.md](templates/prd.md) |
| Brief | generated with PRD (no separate trigger) | [brief.md](references/brief.md) | [brief.md](templates/brief.md) |
| Design Doc | discovery -> analysis -> drafting | [design.md](references/design.md) | [design.md](templates/design.md) |
| TDD | discovery -> analysis -> drafting | [tdd.md](references/tdd.md) | [tdd.md](templates/tdd.md) |
| RFC | [clarification] -> analysis -> drafting | [rfc.md](references/rfc.md) | [rfc.md](templates/rfc.md) |
| ADR | [clarification] -> drafting | [adr.md](references/adr.md) | [adr.md](templates/adr.md) |

## Shared Discovery Patterns

**LOAD:** [discovery.md](references/discovery.md) before starting any type that requires discovery.

Discovery applies to: PRD, Design Doc, TDD.
Clarification (lightweight, only when input is incomplete) applies to: RFC, ADR.
Neither applies to: Brief (generated as part of PRD workflow).

## Quality Standards

Requirements must be concrete and measurable across all document types.

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "Search should be fast" | "Search returns results within 200ms" |
| "Easy to use" | "New users complete onboarding in under 2 minutes" |
| "Intuitive interface" | "Task completion rate above 90% without help text" |

## Guidelines

**DO:**
- Always complete discovery before drafting (for types that require it)
- Review the artifact before presenting to user (see Review Checklist below)
- Present draft for user feedback before saving
- Mark unknowns as TBD rather than inventing constraints
- Use concrete, measurable requirements
- Use fixed filenames per type (ADR and RFC keep `{number}-{name}` suffix in kebab-case)

**DON'T:**
- Skip discovery for types that require it
- Assume document type -- detect from trigger or ask
- Include visual/design direction (that belongs in design-builder)
- Use vague adjectives as requirements ("fast", "easy", "intuitive")
- Mix document types in a single file

## Review Checklist

Before presenting any document to the user, verify:

- [ ] No contradictions between sections
- [ ] No unresolved TBDs that block the document's purpose
- [ ] Scope is focused (one document, one purpose)
- [ ] Cross-references to other docs are valid
- [ ] Requirements are concrete and measurable (no vague adjectives)

If issues found: fix inline before presenting. Don't deliver a flawed artifact.

## Output

All documents save to `.artifacts/docs/`. Create the directory if it doesn't exist.

| Type | Filename |
|------|----------|
| PRD | `prd.md` |
| Brief | `brief.md` |
| Design Doc | `design.md` |
| TDD | `tdd.md` |
| RFC | `rfc/{number}-{name}.md` |
| ADR | `adr/{number}-{name}.md` |

For ADR and RFC, use kebab-case for `{name}` and auto-detect the next sequential number from existing files in the respective subdirectory.

## Error Handling

- No `.artifacts/docs/`: Create the directory
- Ambiguous trigger: Ask user which document type
- Missing context for discovery: Ask questions, never assume
- ADR/RFC numbering conflict: Scan existing files in subdirectory and use next available number
