# Spec-Driven Development

Structured development workflow with adaptive depth. Right ceremony for the right scope.

## Workflow

```
specify --> design* --> tasks* --> implement --> verify
  ^______________________________________|  (verify after each task)
```

Adaptive pipeline: Specify and Implement always run; Design and Tasks auto-skip when scope is small enough. Verify runs after every task/range. Validate (UAT) is on-demand.

## Context Loading Strategy

**Base load:**
- `.agents/project.md` (context, if exists)
- Current feature spec.md

**On-demand:**
- `.agents/codebase/*.md` (brownfield)
- `.agents/baselines/*.md` (pre-existing baseline for area)
- `.agents/knowledge.md` (cross-feature decisions and gotchas)
- decisions.md (designing or implementing from user decisions)
- design.md (implementing)
- tasks.md (implementing)
- research/*.md (new technologies)

**Never simultaneous:**
- Multiple feature specs
- Multiple codebase docs

## Triggers

### Feature-Level (auto-sized)

| Trigger Pattern | Reference |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Create new feature, specify feature | [specify.md](references/specify.md) |
| From PRD, extract from document, use this PRD | [specify.md](references/specify.md) (via @file.md) |
| Modify feature, improve feature | [specify.md](references/specify.md) (brownfield) |
| Discuss feature, capture context, how should this work | [discuss.md](references/discuss.md) |
| Create technical design, plan feature | [design.md](references/design.md) |
| Research technology, cache research | [research.md](references/research.md) |
| Create tasks | [tasks.md](references/tasks.md) |
| Implement task, execute task | [implement.md](references/implement.md) |
| Verify implementation, check adherence, verify code | [verify.md](references/verify.md) |
| Validate, UAT, manual testing, test manually | [validate.md](references/validate.md) |
| Quick fix, quick task, small change, bug fix | [quick-mode.md](references/quick-mode.md) |
| Capture baseline, document module, document existing code | [baseline-capture.md](references/baseline-capture.md) |
| List features, show status | [status-specs.md](references/status-specs.md) |

### Guidelines

| Trigger Pattern | Reference |
|-----------------|-----------|
| How to write specs | [spec-writing.md](references/spec-writing.md) |
| How to decompose tasks | [tasks.md](references/tasks.md) |
| Codebase exploration | [codebase-exploration.md](references/codebase-exploration.md) |
| Research patterns | [research.md](references/research.md) |
| Baseline discovery | [baseline-discovery.md](references/baseline-discovery.md) |
| Extract from PRD/docs | [doc-extraction.md](references/doc-extraction.md) |
| Coding principles | [coding-principles.md](references/coding-principles.md) |
| Status workflow, when to update status | [status-workflow.md](references/status-workflow.md) |

Notes:

- `deep-verify.md` is not a direct trigger. It is loaded by `verify.md`
  during Step 5 (Code Correctness).
- `baseline-discovery.md` is subordinate to `specify.md` Step 8 (requires
  a feature hypothesis). For hypothesis-free documentation, use
  `baseline-capture.md` instead.

## Cross-References

```
specify.md --------> discuss.md (when gray areas detected)
specify.md --------> quick-mode.md (when Small scope)
specify.md --------> design.md (when Large/Complex, spec complete)
specify.md --------> implement.md (when Medium, skip design/tasks)
design.md ---------> tasks.md (when Large/Complex)
design.md ---------> research.md (if new tech)
tasks.md ----------> implement.md
implement.md ------> coding-principles.md (loaded before coding)
implement.md ------> verify.md (after every task/range)
verify.md --------> deep-verify.md (code correctness analysis)
implement.md ------> validate.md (on-demand UAT, any scope)
implement.md ------> tasks.md (safety valve: >5 inline steps)
project-index -----> baseline-capture.md (provides .agents/ context)
baseline-capture.md -> specify.md (when hypothesis forms)
specify.md --------> baseline-discovery.md (checks .agents/baselines/ first)
```

## Auto-Sizing

**Complexity determines depth, not a fixed pipeline.** Before starting any feature, assess its scope and apply only what's needed:

| Scope | What | Specify | Design | Tasks | Implement |
|-------|------|---------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Small** | ≤3 files, one sentence | **Quick mode** -- skip pipeline entirely | - | - | - |
| **Medium** | Clear feature, <10 tasks | Spec (brief) | Skip -- explore inline | Skip -- steps implicit | Implement + verify per step |
| **Large** | Multi-component feature | Full spec + requirement IDs | Full design | Full breakdown + dependencies | Implement + verify per task |
| **Complex** | Ambiguity, new domain | Full spec + [discuss gray areas](references/discuss.md) | Research + full design | Breakdown + parallel design | Implement + verify per task |

**Rules:**

- **Specify and Implement are always required** -- you always need to know WHAT and DO it
- **Design is skipped** when the change is straightforward (no architectural decisions, no new patterns)
- **Tasks is skipped** when there are ≤3 obvious steps (they become implicit in Implement)
- **Discuss is triggered within Specify** only when the agent detects ambiguous gray areas that need user input
- **Verify runs after every task/range** -- checks design adherence, pattern adherence, code correctness (tooling-aware deep analysis), and visual adherence (optional)
- **Validate (UAT) is on-demand** -- user requests it when they want to manually test, any scope
- **Quick mode** is the express lane -- for bug fixes, config changes, and small tweaks
- **Verification is continuous** -- quality gates and acceptance criteria run after each task or range, never deferred to the end

**Safety valve:** Even when Tasks is skipped, Implement ALWAYS starts by listing atomic steps inline (see [implement.md](references/implement.md)). If that listing reveals >5 steps or complex dependencies, STOP and create a formal `tasks.md` -- the Tasks phase was wrongly skipped.

## Project Structure

```
.artifacts/
├── features/
│   └── {ID}-{name}/
│       ├── spec.md       # WHAT: Requirements (always created)
│       ├── decisions.md  # WHY: Decisions on gray areas (only when discuss triggered)
│       ├── design.md     # HOW: Architecture (only for Large/Complex)
│       ├── tasks.md      # WHEN: Tasks (only for Large/Complex)
│       └── designs/      # Visual references (optional)
├── quick/                # Quick mode tasks
│   └── NNN-{slug}/
│       ├── task.md
│       └── summary.md    # Post-execution summary
└── research/             # Research cache (reusable across features)
    └── {topic}.md
```

**Project context:**
```
.agents/
├── project.md            # Project context (project-index)
├── codebase/             # Codebase analysis (project-index)
├── baselines/            # Behavioral baselines (baseline-capture)
│   └── {area-name}.md
└── knowledge.md          # Cross-feature decisions and gotchas (spec-driven)
```

> Note: `.agents/codebase/` is generated by the `project-index` skill. `.agents/knowledge.md` is owned by spec-driven -- it accumulates project-level decisions, gotchas, and patterns across features. project-index reads but never overwrites it. If `.agents/` doesn't exist, Specify suggests running project-index for better context (especially for brownfield projects). All feature artifacts stay within `.artifacts/`.

## Templates

| Context | Template |
|---------|----------|
| Feature spec | [spec.md](templates/spec.md) |
| Discuss context | [decisions.md](templates/decisions.md) |
| Technical design | [design.md](templates/design.md) |
| Task breakdown | [tasks.md](templates/tasks.md) |
| Quick task | [quick-task.md](templates/quick-task.md) |
| Quick summary | [quick-summary.md](templates/quick-summary.md) |
| Codebase exploration | [exploration.md](templates/exploration.md) |
| Research cache | [research.md](templates/research.md) |
| Baseline capture | [baseline.md](templates/baseline.md) |

## Knowledge Verification Chain

When researching, designing, or making any technical decision, follow this chain in strict order. Never skip steps.

```
Step 1: Codebase   -> check existing code, conventions, and patterns already in use
Step 2: Project docs -> README, docs/, inline comments, .agents/codebase/
Step 3: Context7 MCP -> resolve library ID, then query for current API/patterns
Step 4: Web search   -> official docs, reputable sources, community patterns
Step 5: Flag uncertain -> "I'm not certain about X -- here's my reasoning, but verify"
```

**Rules:**

- Never skip to Step 5 if Steps 1-4 are available
- Step 5 is ALWAYS flagged as uncertain -- never presented as fact
- **NEVER assume or fabricate.** If you cannot find an answer, say "I don't know" or "I couldn't find documentation for this". Inventing APIs, patterns, or behaviors causes cascading failures across design -> tasks -> implementation. Uncertainty is always preferable to fabrication.

## Guidelines

**DO:**
- Separate content by purpose: spec=WHAT (goals, stories, ACs), design=HOW, tasks=WHEN
- Follow status flow: draft -> ready -> in-progress -> done
- Use sequential Feature IDs (001, 002)
- Reuse research cache across features (.artifacts/research/)
- Consume `.agents/` for project context and codebase info (optional -- use if exists)
- Retrofeed `.agents/codebase/` with new discoveries during design and implement phases
- Feed `.agents/knowledge.md` with project-level decisions and gotchas during design and implement
- Auto-size depth based on complexity -- skip phases that add no value
- Run verify after each task or range -- design adherence, pattern adherence, visual (if references exist)
- Check `.agents/baselines/` for existing baselines before running baseline-discovery from scratch

**DON'T:**
- Reuse Feature IDs from previous features
- Mix spec, design, and task content in a single file
- Skip status transitions (e.g., jumping from draft to done)
- Create feature-specific research files outside .artifacts/research/
- Generate `.agents/` content from scratch (that's project-index's responsibility)
- Force full pipeline on small/medium changes -- respect auto-sizing
- Assume or fabricate when information is unavailable -- follow Knowledge Verification Chain
- Defer verification to the end -- verify runs per task/range, not as a final batch
- Loop indefinitely on verify findings -- escape after 3 failed fix attempts

## Phase Transitions

Each phase (specify, design, research, tasks, implement) should run in a clean
context window. A polluted window (used for research and then for implementation)
grows large and increases hallucination risk.

**Between phases:**

```
finish phase -> append to session dump -> clean window -> start next phase
                                                           ...
                                                         (more phases)
                                                           ...
                                         end of session -> wrap-up (reads dump)
```

1. Complete the current phase and write its artifacts to disk
2. Append session context to `.artifacts/.session-dump.md` -- a near-complete
   dump of what happened (decisions, discoveries, blockers, open items, phase
   completed, next phase). Each phase appends, building a cumulative record
3. Clear the context window
4. Start the next phase in a clean window, loading only the artifacts it needs

The session dump is ephemeral -- wrap-up reads it at end of session to compose
notes, then the file is disposable. It is not a project artifact.

**Sub-agent dispatch:**

Research and implementation phases can be delegated to sub-agents for better
context isolation and parallelism. The artifacts on disk are the handoff
mechanism -- sub-agents don't need to return findings through the context.

- Research sub-agent: reads codebase + external sources, writes to
  `.artifacts/research/{topic}.md`
- Implementation sub-agents: receive spec + design + task(s), write code to
  disk. Main agent coordinates and runs verify
- Parallel tasks (`[P]` marker) map directly to independent sub-agents

## Error Handling

- No .artifacts/: Create it (features/ and research/ are created on demand)
- Spec not found: List available features
- Open questions blocking architecture: Resolve before planning (trigger discuss)
- Design not found: Suggest design before tasks (or skip if Medium scope)
- Tasks not found: Suggest tasks before implement (or skip if Medium scope)
- Scope misjudged: Safety valve catches it -- redirect to appropriate phase
- Baseline target not found: Offer discovery mode to list available areas
- Baseline already exists: Ask user whether to update or capture adjacent area
