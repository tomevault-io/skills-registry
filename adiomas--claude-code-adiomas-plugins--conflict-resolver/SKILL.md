# Conflict Resolution Skill

Resolve git merge conflicts intelligently, with safe fallback to user input when uncertain.

## Resolution Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Conflicted Files

List all files with merge conflicts:
```bash
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
```

### Step 2: Analyze Each Conflict

For each conflicted file:
1. Read the file with conflict markers
2. Understand what HEAD version accomplishes
3. Understand what incoming version accomplishes
4. Determine resolution strategy

### Step 3: Apply Resolution Strategy

Select strategy based on conflict type:

| Conflict Type | Strategy |
|--------------|----------|
| **Additive changes** | Both add different things → keep both |
| **Same location, different code** | Understand intent, merge logic |
| **Conflicting imports** | Combine import lists |
| **Style conflicts** | Use project lint/format to normalize |

### Step 4: Resolve and Stage

After resolving:
```bash
git add <resolved-file>
```

### Step 5: Complete Merge

Finalize the merge commit:
```bash
git commit --no-edit
```

## Uncertainty Handling

**Critical rule:** Never guess on complex conflicts.

When uncertain about resolution:

1. **Do NOT make assumptions**
2. **Show the conflict to user** with context
3. **Present options:**
   - "Keep HEAD version"
   - "Keep incoming version"
   - "Manual edit needed"
4. **Wait for user decision**

## Common Patterns

### Import Conflicts

Combine import statements:
```javascript
// HEAD
import { ComponentA } from './components';

// Incoming
import { ComponentB } from './components';

// Resolution
import { ComponentA, ComponentB } from './components';
```

### Additive Function Conflicts

Keep both functions when they don't overlap:
```typescript
// HEAD adds functionA
// Incoming adds functionB
// Resolution: keep both
```

### Overlapping Logic

Analyze intent and merge carefully:
- If both change the same logic differently → ask user
- If one extends the other → keep the extension
- If conflicting business logic → ask user

## Safety Rules

1. **Never delete user code** without confirmation
2. **Preserve all functionality** from both branches when possible
3. **When in doubt, ask** - wrong merges are worse than slow merges
4. **Test after resolution** - run verification to catch merge errors

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do NOT use this skill when:

1. **No actual merge conflicts exist** - Only use when `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U` returns files
2. **Conflicts are in generated files** - Regenerate instead of resolving (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, dist/, build/)
3. **Rebasing is more appropriate** - For feature branches behind main, prefer rebase over merge
4. **User explicitly wants manual resolution** - When user says "I'll handle this myself"
5. **Binary file conflicts** - Cannot merge binary files; user must choose one version

## Quality Standards

1. **ALWAYS** verify there are actual conflicts before proceeding
2. **NEVER** auto-resolve conflicts involving business logic without understanding intent
3. **ALWAYS** run tests after resolving to catch merge errors
4. **ALWAYS** preserve both branches' functionality when possible
5. **PRIORITIZE** asking user over guessing on complex conflicts
