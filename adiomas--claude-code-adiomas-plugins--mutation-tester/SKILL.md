# Mutation Testing Skill

Verify that your tests actually catch bugs by running mutation testing on changed code.

## What is Mutation Testing?

Mutation testing inserts deliberate bugs (mutations) into your code, then runs tests. If tests don't fail, they're not catching that type of bug.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Original code
if (age >= 18) {
  return "adult";
}

// Mutation: >= becomes >
if (age > 18) {
  return "adult";
}
```

If your tests pass on the mutated code, you're missing edge case coverage for `age === 18`.

## When to Run

1. **After TDD GREEN phase** - Verify tests are meaningful
2. **Before integration** - Ensure quality before merge
3. **On critical paths** - Auth, payments, security code
4. **On demand** - When user requests test verification

## Protocol

### Step 1: Check Project Profile

```bash
cat .claude/project-profile.yaml
```

Identify the language/framework to select the right mutation tool.

### Step 2: Identify Changed Files

Only mutate files that changed (incremental testing):

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~1 | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|py|go|rs)$'
```

### Step 3: Run Mutation Testing

Select tool based on language:

| Language | Tool | Command |
|----------|------|---------|
| TypeScript/JS | Stryker | `npx stryker run --mutate 'src/**/*.ts'` |
| Python | mutmut | `mutmut run --paths-to-mutate=src/` |
| Go | go-mutesting | `go-mutesting ./...` |
| Rust | cargo-mutants | `cargo mutants` |

### Step 4: Analyze Results

**Mutation Score = Killed Mutants / Total Mutants**

- **> 80%**: Good - tests are effective
- **60-80%**: Acceptable - consider adding edge case tests
- **< 60%**: Poor - tests are weak, add more coverage

### Step 5: Report Surviving Mutants

For each surviving mutant, explain:
1. What was mutated
2. Why test didn't catch it
3. What test to add

## Configuration

Create `.stryker.conf.json` or configure in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "mutate": ["src/**/*.ts", "!src/**/*.test.ts"],
  "testRunner": "vitest",
  "reporters": ["progress", "clear-text"],
  "coverageAnalysis": "perTest",
  "timeoutMS": 10000
}
```

## Optimization Strategy

**Problem:** Full mutation testing is SLOW (minutes to hours).

**Solution:** Incremental testing on changed lines only.

```yaml
# .claude/auto-config.yaml
mutation_testing:
  enabled: true
  scope: changed_lines_only  # Not full codebase
  minimum_score: 80
  block_on_failure: true
  priority_paths:
    - src/lib/auth/
    - src/lib/payments/
    - src/api/
  skip_patterns:
    - "*.test.ts"
    - "*.spec.ts"
    - "*.d.ts"
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## Mutation Testing Results

**Scope:** src/lib/auth/validate.ts (changed files only)

### Summary
- Mutations generated: 24
- Mutations killed: 21 ✓
- Mutations survived: 3 ⚠️
- **Score: 87.5%** (threshold: 80%) ✅

### Surviving Mutants

#### 1. Boundary Condition (line 45)
```typescript
// Original
if (token.exp > Date.now())

// Mutation (survived)
if (token.exp >= Date.now())
```
**Issue:** No test covers exact expiry boundary
**Fix:** Add test: `test("rejects token at exact expiry time")`

#### 2. Default Value (line 67)
```typescript
// Original
return user?.role ?? 'guest'

// Mutation (survived)
return user?.role ?? 'admin'
```
**Issue:** No test verifies default role
**Fix:** Add test: `test("returns guest role when user.role is undefined")`

#### 3. Off-by-One (line 89)
```typescript
// Original
if (attempts >= MAX_ATTEMPTS)

// Mutation (survived)
if (attempts > MAX_ATTEMPTS)
```
**Issue:** Boundary at MAX_ATTEMPTS not tested
**Fix:** Add test: `test("blocks at exactly MAX_ATTEMPTS")`

### Recommendation
Add 3 edge case tests before proceeding.
Score after fixes (estimated): 100%
```

## Integration with TDD

The TDD cycle becomes:

```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → MUTATE → ✓ Done
                           ↓
                  Score < 80%?
                       ↓
                  Add more tests
                       ↓
                  Back to RED
```

- **`references/tools-by-language.md`** - Tool setup for each language

## Quality Standards

**Block if:**
- Score < 80% on critical paths (auth, payments)
- Score < 60% on any changed code
- Security-related mutations survive

**Warn if:**
- Score between 60-80%
- Non-critical mutations survive

**Pass if:**
- Score >= 80%
- All critical path mutations killed

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do NOT use this skill when:

1. **No mutation testing tool is configured** - Requires Stryker, mutmut, or similar
2. **Tests are not yet written** - Run after TDD GREEN phase, not during RED
3. **Pure UI/styling changes** - Mutation testing is for logic, not visuals
4. **Generated code** - Don't mutate auto-generated files (Prisma clients, etc.)
5. **Time-critical tasks** - Full mutation runs are slow; skip in urgent situations
6. **Configuration files** - Mutation testing is for code logic only
