# Task Decomposition Skill

Break down feature requests into atomic, verifiable tasks with clear dependencies for parallel execution.

## Core Principles

1. **Atomic Tasks** - Each task completes in one focused session
2. **Clear Boundaries** - Each task modifies a specific set of files
3. **Verifiable** - Each task has explicit "done" criteria
4. **Dependency-Aware** - Mark which tasks depend on others

## Decomposition Process

### Step 1: Understand the Feature

Analyze what the feature needs to accomplish:
- Core functionality required
- User-facing behavior
- Backend/API requirements
- Data model needs

### Step 2: Identify Components

Map the feature to architectural components:

| Component Type | Examples |
|---------------|----------|
| Data models / schemas | Database tables, TypeScript types |
| API endpoints / server functions | REST routes, GraphQL resolvers |
| UI components | React components, pages |
| Business logic / utilities | Helper functions, services |
| Tests | Unit tests, integration tests |

### Step 3: Map Dependencies

Determine execution order based on dependencies:
- Data models are usually independent (can parallelize)
- APIs depend on models
- UI depends on APIs (or can run parallel with mocks)
- Integration tests depend on everything

### Step 4: Create Task List

Format each task with this structure:
```
Task N: [Descriptive Name]
- Depends on: none | [task ids]
- Files: [list of files to create/modify]
- Done when: [specific verification criteria]
- Complexity: S/M/L
```

### Step 4b: Feature List Pattern (REQUIRED)

**CRITICAL: All tasks MUST start as failing and require evidence for completion.**

In addition to the task list, generate a YAML feature list that tracks verification status:

```yaml
features:
  - id: task-001
    description: "Create UserForm component with validation"
    status: failing  # MUST always start as failing
    verification_command: "npm test -- --testPathPattern='UserForm'"
    expected_output: "Tests: X passed, 0 failed"
    evidence_required: true  # MUST be true
    can_be_removed: false    # Prevents premature removal

  - id: task-002
    description: "Add API endpoint for user creation"
    status: failing
    verification_command: "npm test -- --testPathPattern='users.api'"
    expected_output: "Tests: X passed, 0 failed"
    evidence_required: true
    can_be_removed: false
```

**Feature List Rules:**

1. **status: failing** - ALL features MUST start with `status: failing`
   - This ensures test-first development
   - A task cannot be marked complete until verification proves it works

2. **evidence_required: true** - ALL features MUST have this set
   - No task can be marked complete without captured verification output
   - Prevents "I think it works" completions

3. **can_be_removed: false** - Prevents scope reduction
   - Features cannot be removed from the list once added
   - If a feature is genuinely not needed, it must be marked as `skipped` with reason

4. **verification_command** - Executable command that proves the feature works
   - Must be specific (not generic "npm test")
   - Must target only relevant tests

5. **expected_output** - Pattern to match in successful output
   - Used to validate that verification actually passed

Write the feature list to `.claude/plans/features-{timestamp}.yaml` alongside the task plan.

### Step 5: Identify Parallel Groups

Group tasks by execution phase:
```
Group 1 (Parallel): [independent tasks]
Group 2 (Parallel): [tasks depending on Group 1]
Group 3 (Sequential): [tasks with complex dependencies]
```

## Output Location

Write decomposed tasks to the execution plan at `.claude/plans/auto-{timestamp}.md`.

## Complexity Guidelines

| Size | Scope | Time Estimate |
|------|-------|---------------|
| S | Single file, simple logic | < 15 min |
| M | Multiple files, moderate logic | 15-45 min |
| L | Many files, complex logic | > 45 min |

Prefer breaking L tasks into smaller S/M tasks when possible.

## Auto-Detection Patterns (NEW)

Use these patterns to automatically identify parallelizable tasks:

### Independent Task Detection

| Pattern | Example Files | Parallelizable? | Reason |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Different components, same type | sidebar.tsx, header.tsx, footer.tsx | ✅ YES | No imports between them |
| CSS/config files | globals.css, tailwind.config.ts | ✅ YES | Config files are independent |
| Multiple API endpoints | api/users.ts, api/posts.ts, api/comments.ts | ✅ YES | Separate route handlers |
| Multiple data models | models/User.ts, models/Post.ts | ✅ YES | Independent type definitions |
| Utility functions | utils/format.ts, utils/validate.ts | ✅ YES | Pure functions, no state |

### Dependent Task Detection

| Pattern | Example Files | Parallelizable? | Reason |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Component + its test | Button.tsx, Button.test.tsx | ❌ NO | Test imports component |
| API + UI consuming it | api/users.ts, UserList.tsx | ❌ NO | UI imports API |
| Type + consumer | types/user.ts, UserCard.tsx | ❌ NO | Component imports type |
| Base + derived | BaseComponent.tsx, ChildComponent.tsx | ❌ NO | Child extends base |
| Schema + migration | schema.prisma, migration.sql | ❌ NO | Migration uses schema |

### Dependency Detection Rules

1. **Import Analysis**
   ```
   IF File A contains "import ... from './FileB'"
   THEN A depends on B → SEQUENTIAL

   IF no imports between files
   THEN INDEPENDENT → PARALLEL
   ```

2. **Type Dependencies**
   ```
   IF Component uses type from types/foo.ts
   THEN types/foo.ts must be created FIRST
   THEN component can run in parallel with OTHER components using same type
   ```

3. **State Dependencies**
   ```
   IF Component A modifies global state that B reads
   THEN A must complete before B → SEQUENTIAL

   IF Components use independent local state
   THEN INDEPENDENT → PARALLEL
   ```

4. **Layer Dependencies (Common Pattern)**
   ```
   Layer 1: Types/Models     → INDEPENDENT (parallelize)
   Layer 2: API/Services     → Depends on Layer 1
   Layer 3: UI Components    → Depends on Layer 2 (or parallel with mocks)
   Layer 4: Integration Tests → Depends on all
   ```

### Quick Decision Flowchart

```
For each pair of files (A, B):
     │
     ▼
Does A import B or B import A?
     │
     ├── YES → SEQUENTIAL (create dependency edge)
     │
     └── NO → Do they share mutable state?
                   │
                   ├── YES → SEQUENTIAL
                   │
                   └── NO → PARALLEL ✓
```

## Parallelization Threshold

**Automatic parallelization triggers when:**
- `independent_tasks >= 3` (configurable in auto-context.yaml)
- No circular dependencies exist
- Tasks are in same architectural layer

**Skip parallelization when:**
- `independent_tasks < 3` (overhead not worth it)
- All tasks have linear dependencies
- Single-file changes
- Trivial fixes (typos, renames)

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do NOT use this skill when:

1. **Single-file changes** - No decomposition needed for trivial tasks
2. **Typo fixes and renames** - Skip for simple refactors
3. **User provides explicit task list** - Trust user's own decomposition
4. **Research/audit tasks** - Use research workflow instead
5. **Documentation-only changes** - Docs don't need complex decomposition

## Quality Standards

1. **ALWAYS** identify dependencies between tasks explicitly
2. **NEVER** create tasks that modify the same files in parallel
3. **ALWAYS** include verification criteria ("Done when...")
4. **ALWAYS** assign complexity (S/M/L) to each task
5. **PRIORITIZE** breaking L-sized tasks into smaller S/M tasks
6. **ALWAYS** write task plan to `.claude/plans/` directory
