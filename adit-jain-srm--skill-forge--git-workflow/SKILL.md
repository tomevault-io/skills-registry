## Overview

Enforce disciplined git practices on every operation — small atomic commits, conventional messages, clean branch hygiene, and PR readiness checks. Changes how the agent handles git, not just what commands it knows.

# Git Workflow

Change how you handle git. Not a reference — a DISCIPLINE.

## Persistence

ACTIVE on every git operation. Every commit, every branch, every PR. Not optional. Off only when user explicitly says "skip git discipline".

## The Discipline

### Every Commit Must Be

```
SMALL: One logical change (if you need "and" to describe it, split it)
ATOMIC: Passes tests on its own (any commit can be reverted safely)
MESSAGED: Conventional format (type: concise description)
CLEAN: No debug logs, no commented code, no TODOs you won't do
```

Before EVERY `git commit`:
1. `git diff --staged` — READ what you're actually committing
2. Is this ONE thing? If not, `git reset HEAD` and commit in parts
3. Write message: `type(scope): what changed` (not "update files")
4. Check: would reverting THIS commit break anything else? (shouldn't)

### Branching

```
RULE: Never commit directly to main/master
RULE: Branch names describe the work: feat/add-auth, fix/login-timeout
RULE: Branches live < 3 days (if longer, you're batching too much)
RULE: Rebase before PR (clean linear history)
```

### Before Creating a PR

Run this checklist YOURSELF before showing the PR to the user:

```
[ ] All commits are atomic and conventional
[ ] No fixup commits left (squash them)
[ ] Branch is rebased on latest main
[ ] Tests pass on the branch
[ ] No unrelated changes snuck in
[ ] PR description explains WHY not just WHAT
[ ] Diff is < 400 lines (if larger, split into multiple PRs)
```

### Conventional Commit Types

| Type | When |
|------|------|
| `feat` | New capability for users |
| `fix` | Bug that affected users |
| `refactor` | Code change, no behavior change |
| `test` | Adding/fixing tests only |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Build, deps, config |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |

### Bad → Good

```
BAD:  "update stuff"
GOOD: "feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation"

BAD:  "fix bug"  
GOOD: "fix(checkout): prevent double-charge on timeout retry"

BAD:  one commit with 15 files changed across 3 features
GOOD: 3 commits, each touching one feature, each revertable alone
```

## Auto-Triggers

When you're about to:
- `git add .` → STOP. Stage selectively. Read the diff.
- `git commit -m "..."` → CHECK: is the message conventional? Is the change atomic?
- `git push` → CHECK: is the branch rebased? Tests pass?
- Create a PR → RUN the PR checklist above.

## Why

Messy git = impossible to debug, revert, or review. Disciplined git = every commit is a rollback point, every PR is reviewable, every message is searchable. This compounds over months into a codebase that's navigable by archaeology.
