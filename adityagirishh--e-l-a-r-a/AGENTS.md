# PROBLEM STATEMENT

## Round 1 — Problem Statement

### The Task

Build a complete, real-world OpenEnv environment that an AI agent can learn from through the standard `step() / reset() / state()` API.

---

## Key Requirements at a Glance

- Must simulate a real-world task (not games or toys)
- Implement full OpenEnv spec: typed models, step()/reset()/state(), openenv.yaml
- Minimum 3 tasks with agent graders (easy → medium → hard, scores 0.0–1.0)
- Meaningful reward function with partial progress signals
- Baseline inference script with reproducible scores
- Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces + working Dockerfile
- README with environment description, action/observation spaces, setup instructions

---

## Functional Requirements

### Real-world task simulation

The environment must simulate a task humans actually do. Not games, not toys. Examples: email triage, code review, data cleaning, scheduling, customer support, content moderation.

---

### OpenEnv spec compliance

Implement the full OpenEnv interface:
- Typed Observation, Action, and Reward Pydantic models  
- `step(action)` → returns observation, reward, done, info  
- `reset()` → returns initial observation  
- `state()` → returns current state  
- `openenv.yaml` with metadata  
- Tested via openenv validate  

---

### Minimum 3 tasks with agent graders

Each task defines a concrete objective an agent must accomplish, with a programmatic grader that scores performance (0.0–1.0).

Tasks should range: easy → medium → hard.

Graders must have clear, deterministic success/failure criteria.

---

### Meaningful reward function

Provides signal over the full trajectory (not just binary end-of-episode).  
Rewards partial progress toward task completion.  
Penalizes clearly undesirable behavior (e.g. infinite loops, destructive actions).

---

### Baseline inference script

Uses the OpenAI API client to run a model against the environment.  
Reads API credentials from environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).  
Produces a reproducible baseline score on all 3 tasks.

---

# Detailed Requirements

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Deploys to a Hugging Face Space

Environment must run as a containerized HF Space tagged with openenv.

---

### Containerized execution

Must include a working Dockerfile.  
The environment should start cleanly with:

```

docker build
docker run

````

---

### Documentation

README must include:
- Environment description and motivation  
- Action and observation space definitions  
- Task descriptions with expected difficulty  
- Setup and usage instructions  
- Baseline scores  

---

# Scoring Breakdown

## Real-world utility (30%)

- 0–5: Toy/artificial problem with no practical application  
- 6–15: Valid domain but shallow modeling of the real task  
- 16–25: Good domain modeling, would be useful for agent evaluation  
- 26–30: Excellent — fills a real gap, immediate value for the RL/agent community  

---

## Task & grader quality (25%)

- 3+ tasks with difficulty range?  
- Graders produce scores between 0.0–1.0?  
- Graders deterministic and reproducible?  
- Hard task genuinely challenges frontier models?  

---

## Environment design (20%)

- reset() produces clean state?  
- Action/observation types well-designed and documented?  
- Reward function provides useful varying signal (not just sparse)?  
- Episode boundaries sensible?  

---

## Code quality & spec compliance (15%)

- openenv validate passes?  
- docker build && docker run works?  
- HF Space deploys and responds?  
- Baseline script runs and reproduces scores?  

---

## Creativity & novelty (10%)

- Domain we haven’t seen in OpenEnv before?  
- Reward design has interesting properties?  
- Clever mechanics that make the environment engaging?  

---

# Evaluation Criteria

## Phase 1: Automated Validation

Pass/fail gate — HF Space deploys, OpenEnv spec compliance, Dockerfile builds, baseline reproduces, 3+ tasks with graders.

---

## Phase 2: Agentic Evaluation

Scored — baseline agent re-run, standard Open LLM agent (e.g. Nemotron 3 Super) run against all environments, score variance check.

---

## Phase 3: Human Review

Top submissions reviewed by Meta and Hugging Face engineers for real-world utility, creativity, and exploit checks.

---

# Disqualification Criteria

- Environment does not deploy or respond  
- Plagiarized or trivially modified existing environments  
- Graders that always return the same score  
- No baseline inference script  

---

# How Judging Works

## Pre-Submission Checklist — all must pass or you're disqualified

- HF Space deploys  
  - Automated ping to the Space URL — must return 200 and respond to reset()  

- OpenEnv spec compliance  
  - Validate openenv.yaml, typed models, step()/reset()/state() endpoints  

- Dockerfile builds  
  - Automated docker build on the submitted repo  

- Baseline reproduces  
  - Run the submitted inference script — must complete without error and produce scores  

- 3+ tasks with graders  
  - Enumerate tasks, run each grader, verify scores in 0.0–1.0 range  

---

# Additional Instructions

Before submitting, ensure the following variables are defined in your environment configuration:

- API_BASE_URL — The API endpoint for the LLM  
- MODEL_NAME — The model identifier to use for inference  
- HF_TOKEN — Your Hugging Face / API key  

---

## Inference Script Requirements

- Must be named `inference.py`  
- Must be placed in the root directory of the project  
- Must use OpenAI Client for all LLM calls  

---

# Infra Restrictions

- Runtime of inference script should be less than 20 min  
- Must run on:
  - vCPU = 2  
  - Memory = 8GB  

---

# Validator

Run the pre-submission validation script before submitting.

---

# Sample Inference Script
