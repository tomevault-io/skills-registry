# Architecture Review

## Purpose

Conduct peer review of architecture documents to identify risks, bottlenecks, optimization opportunities, and provide expert recommendations. Goes beyond validation to critically analyze architecture quality and suggest improvements.

**Core Principles:**
- **Critical analysis:** Question assumptions, identify weaknesses
- **Risk-focused:** Prioritize risks by severity and likelihood
- **Constructive feedback:** Balance criticism with actionable improvements
- **Context-aware:** Consider business goals, team capabilities, constraints

---

## Prerequisites

- Architecture document exists and is reasonably complete
- Optionally: Requirements document for alignment verification

---

## Workflow

### 1. Load Architecture and Context

**Action:** Read architecture document

Execute:
```bash
python .claude/skills/bmad-commands/scripts/read_file.py \
  --path {architecture_file} \
  --output json
```

**If requirements provided:** Also load for comparison

**Parse architecture to understand:**
- System scale (users, data, traffic)
- Technology choices
- Architectural patterns used
- Deployment strategy
- Team context (size, expertise)

---

### 2. Determine Review Focus

**If focus_area specified:** Prioritize that dimension
**If "all" or unspecified:** Review all dimensions

**Review Dimensions:**
1. **Scalability:** Can it scale with growth?
2. **Security:** Are there vulnerabilities?
3. **Performance:** Optimization opportunities?
4. **Maintainability:** Technical debt risks?
5. **Technology Fit:** Are choices appropriate?
6. **Cost:** Infrastructure/operational costs?
7. **Team Capability:** Can team execute this?

---

### 3. Scalability Review

**Analyze scalability considerations:**

**Check for:**
- ✅ Identified bottlenecks
- ✅ Horizontal scaling strategy
- ✅ Database scaling plan (read replicas, sharding)
- ✅ Stateless design (for scaling)
- ✅ Load balancing approach
- ✅ Cache strategy
- ✅ CDN for static assets

**Common Issues:**
🟠 **Database as bottleneck**
- Single database instance
- No read replicas planned
- No sharding strategy

🟠 **Session state preventing scaling**
- In-memory sessions
- No sticky sessions/Redis

🟠 **No caching strategy**
- Direct database queries
- No CDN for static assets

🟠 **Monolithic architecture at high scale**
- Single deployment unit
- Coupling prevents independent scaling

**Recommendations:**
- Add database read replicas
- Implement Redis for sessions/caching
- Plan microservices extraction for bottlenecks
- Add CDN for static content

**See:** `references/scalability-review-guide.md`

---

### 4. Security Review

**Analyze security posture:**

**Check for:**
- ✅ Authentication mechanism (OAuth, JWT, session)
- ✅ Authorization strategy (RBAC, ABAC)
- ✅ Data encryption (at rest, in transit)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection prevention
- ✅ XSS prevention
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Security headers
- ✅ Secrets management

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
🔴 **Critical: Missing authentication**
- No auth mechanism documented
- Recommendation: Add JWT or session-based auth

🔴 **Critical: No input validation**
- User inputs not validated
- Risk: SQL injection, XSS
- Recommendation: Add validation layer (Zod, Joi)

🟠 **Medium: Passwords not hashed**
- Plain text storage
- Recommendation: Use bcrypt (cost factor 12)

🟡 **Low: No rate limiting**
- Vulnerable to brute force
- Recommendation: Add rate limiting (5 req/min)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Add rate limiting for auth endpoints
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Implement CSRF tokens
- Add security headers (helmet.js)

**See:** `references/security-review-guide.md`

---

### 5. Performance Review

**Analyze performance optimization:**

**Check for:**
- ✅ Response time targets (p50, p95, p99)
- ✅ Caching strategy
- ✅ Database query optimization
- ✅ N+1 query prevention
- ✅ Lazy loading / code splitting
- ✅ Asset optimization (images, bundles)
- ✅ CDN usage

**Common Issues:**
🟠 **N+1 query problem**

- Recommendation: Use joins or batch loading

🟠 **No caching**
- Repeated database queries
- Recommendation: Add Redis caching

🟠 **Large bundle sizes**
- >500KB initial bundle
- Recommendation: Code splitting, lazy loading

🟠 **Unoptimized images**
- Large image files
- Recommendation: Image optimization, WebP format

**Recommendations:**
- Implement Redis caching (5-min TTL)
- Add database query optimization (indexes, joins)
- Enable code splitting (route-based)
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Add CDN for static assets

**See:** `references/performance-review-guide.md`

- Business logic in controllers
- Recommendation: Service layer pattern

🟡 **No testing strategy**
- Tests not mentioned
- Recommendation: Add unit + integration tests

🟡 **Tight coupling**
- Components tightly coupled
- Recommendation: Dependency injection, interfaces

🟡 **No deprecation strategy**
- No plan for tech evolution
- Recommendation: Version APIs, plan migrations

**Recommendations:**
- Adopt repository/service pattern
- Define testing strategy (80% coverage)
- Implement dependency injection
- Plan for API versioning

---

### 7. Technology Fit Review

**Evaluate technology choices:**

**For each major technology:**
- ✅ Appropriate for scale?
- ✅ Team has expertise?
- ✅ Community support strong?
- ✅ Long-term viability?
- ✅ Better alternatives exist?

**Common Concerns:**
🟠 **Over-engineering**
- Kubernetes for small app
- Recommendation: Start with simpler hosting (Vercel, Heroku)

🟠 **Under-engineering**
- SQLite for high-traffic app
- Recommendation: Upgrade to PostgreSQL

🟡 **Trend-chasing**
- Latest tech without justification
- Recommendation: Use proven technologies

🟡 **Team mismatch**
- Tech team doesn't know
- Recommendation: Consider team expertise

**Alternative Technologies to Consider:**

**Example 1:** Redux → Zustand
- Simpler API, less boilerplate
- Trade-off: Smaller ecosystem

**Example 2:** Microservices → Modular Monolith
- Simpler deployment, lower ops
- Trade-off: Less independent scaling

**See:** `references/technology-alternatives.md`

### 9. Risk Assessment

**Identify and prioritize risks:**

**Risk Categories:**
- **Critical (🔴):** Immediate blockers, security vulnerabilities
- **High (🟠):** Significant impact, likely to occur
- **Medium (🟡):** Moderate impact or likelihood
- **Low (🟢):** Minor impact, unlikely

**Risk Assessment Template:**
```markdown
## Risk: [Risk Title]

**Severity:** Critical | High | Medium | Low
**Likelihood:** High | Medium | Low
**Impact:** [Description of impact]
**Mitigation:** [How to address]
**Effort:** [Time/cost to mitigate]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## Risk: Database Becomes Bottleneck at Scale

**Severity:** High (🟠)
**Likelihood:** High (projected 50K users in 6 months)
**Impact:** Performance degradation, poor user experience, potential downtime
**Mitigation:**
1. Add database read replicas (3 hours)
2. Implement Redis caching (4 hours)
3. Plan sharding strategy (2 days research)
**Effort:** ~2 person-days
```

---

### 10. Generate Recommendations

**Categorize recommendations by priority:**

**Priority Levels:**
1. **P0 (Critical):** Must address before production
2. **P1 (High):** Address before launch or soon after
3. **P2 (Medium):** Address in next quarter
4. **P3 (Low):** Nice-to-have improvements

**Recommendation Template:**
```markdown
**[P0] Add Input Validation**
- **Issue:** No validation layer, vulnerable to SQL injection/XSS
- **Recommendation:** Implement Zod schemas for all API inputs
- **Impact:** Critical security vulnerability
- **Effort:** 1-2 days
- **Resources:** [Zod documentation link]
```

**Prioritization Criteria:**
- Security issues → P0/P1
- Scalability blockers → P1/P2
- Performance issues → P1/P2
- Maintainability concerns → P2/P3
- Cost optimizations → P2/P3

---

### 11. Evaluate Alternatives

**For each major architectural decision, consider alternatives:**

**Alternative Evaluation Template:**
```markdown
### Alternative: [Option Name]

**Current Choice:** [What's in architecture]
**Alternative:** [Different approach]

**Pros:**
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

**Cons:**
- Drawback 1
- Drawback 2

**Recommendation:** Keep current | Switch to alternative | Consider for future

**Rationale:** [Why this recommendation]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
### Alternative: Microservices vs. Modular Monolith

**Current Choice:** Microservices architecture

**Alternative:** Modular Monolith

**Pros:**
- Simpler deployment
- Lower operational overhead
- Faster development initially
- Easier debugging

**Cons:**
- Less independent scaling
- Potential coupling over time
- Harder to extract services later

**Recommendation:** Switch to Modular Monolith for now
