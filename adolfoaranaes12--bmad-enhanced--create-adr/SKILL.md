# Create Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Overview

Create comprehensive Architecture Decision Records following industry best practices. ADRs document architectural choices, alternatives considered, rationale, and consequences to provide context for future development.

**ADR Structure:**
- **Context**: Problem and constraints
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Alternatives**: Options evaluated with pros/cons
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
- **Consequences**: Positive, negative, and neutral impacts

## Prerequisites

- docs/adrs/ directory (created if missing)
- Context for decision (file to analyze, problem description, or existing architecture)

---

## Workflow

### Step 0: Determine ADR Number

**Action:** Find next available ADR number.

```bash
# List existing ADRs
ls -la docs/adrs/ 2>/dev/null || echo "ADR directory does not exist"

# Find highest number
find docs/adrs/ -name "adr-*.md" 2>/dev/null | \
  sed 's/.*adr-\([0-9]*\)-.*/\1/' | \
  sort -n | \
  tail -1
```

**Calculate next number:**
- If no ADRs exist: Start at 001
- If ADRs exist: Increment highest by 1

**Create ADR directory if missing:**
```bash
mkdir -p docs/adrs
```

---

### Step 1: Analyze Context

**Action:** Understand what decision needs to be documented.

**Context Types:**

**1. File/Schema Analysis** (like Prisma schema):
```bash
# Read the file to analyze
Read(file_path: {context_path})
```

Analyze to identify:
- **Technology choices**: Database, ORM, patterns used
- **Data modeling decisions**: Schema structure, relationships
- **Architectural patterns**: Multi-tenancy, event sourcing, etc.
- **Design tradeoffs**: Normalization vs. denormalization, indexing strategies

**2. Technology Selection:**
- List technologies being compared
- Identify requirements driving selection
- Note constraints (team skills, budget, timeline)

**3. Pattern Adoption:**
- Describe pattern being adopted
- Explain problem it solves
- Note implementation approach

---

### Step 2: Identify Key Decisions

**Action:** Extract architectural decisions from context.

**For Schema/File Analysis:**
Scan for decision indicators:
- Database technology (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- ORM choice (Prisma, TypeORM, Sequelize)
- Schema patterns (multi-tenancy, soft deletes, audit logs)
- Relationship modeling (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Indexing strategy
- Enum usage for type safety
- JSON/JSONB for flexibility

**Example from Prisma Schema:**
```prisma
// Decision indicators:
- PostgreSQL chosen (ADR: Database Selection)
- Prisma ORM (ADR: ORM Selection)
- Multi-tenancy via hotelId (ADR: Multi-Tenancy Strategy)
- Clerk for auth (ADR: Authentication Provider)
- Event sourcing pattern (ADR: Event Processing Architecture)
```

**Prioritize decisions:**
1. **High Impact**: Database, framework, major patterns
2. **Medium Impact**: Libraries, architectural patterns
3. **Low Impact**: Utility choices, minor patterns

Focus on 1-3 most significant decisions per ADR.

---

### Step 3: Research Alternatives

**Action:** Identify alternatives that could have been chosen.

**For Technology Decisions:**
```
Database: PostgreSQL
Alternatives:
- MySQL (widely used, simpler)
- MongoDB (NoSQL, flexible schema)
- SQLite (embedded, simple)
```

**For each alternative, identify:**
- **Pros**: Advantages and strengths
- **Cons**: Disadvantages and limitations
- **Use cases**: When it's the better choice

**Research sources:**
- Official documentation
- Comparison articles
- Team experience
- Industry best practices

**Minimum alternatives:** At least 2 (typically 3-4)

---

### Step 4: Determine Rationale

**Action:** Explain why the chosen option was selected.

**Rationale factors:**
- **Requirements fit**: How well option meets requirements
- **Team expertise**: Existing skills and experience
- **Timeline**: Impact on delivery speed
- **Cost**: Licensing, hosting, maintenance
- **Scalability**: Handles expected growth
- **Community**: Support availability
- **Risk**: Maturity and stability

**Example rationale:**
```
PostgreSQL chosen over MongoDB because:
1. Data is highly relational (users → hotels → conversations)
2. ACID transactions required for billing
3. Team has strong SQL experience (no MongoDB experience)
4. Scale fits PostgreSQL capabilities (100K users proven)
5. Full-text search built-in (eliminates Elasticsearch)
```

**Make rationale specific and measurable.**

---

### Step 5: Identify Consequences

**Action:** Document impacts of the decision.

**Consequence Types:**

**Positive Consequences:**
- Benefits gained
- Problems solved
- Capabilities enabled

**Negative Consequences:**
- Limitations introduced
- Tradeoffs accepted
- Future constraints

**Mitigation Strategies:**
For each negative consequence, document mitigation:
```
Negative: PostgreSQL vertical scaling limits
Mitigation: Plan read replica strategy, monitor query performance
```

**Neutral Consequences:**
- Changes with mixed/unclear impact
- Future considerations
- Monitoring needs

**Be honest about tradeoffs** - every decision has pros and cons.

---

### Step 6: Write ADR

**Action:** Create ADR document using standard template.

**ADR Template:**
```markdown
# ADR-{NUMBER}: {Decision Title}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** {Team/Role}

## Context

{What problem are we solving? What constraints exist?}

{For schema analysis: Describe the schema structure and requirements}

## Decision

We will use **{CHOSEN OPTION}** for {PURPOSE}.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: {Chosen Option}
**Pros:**
- {Advantage 1}
- {Advantage 2}

**Cons:**
- {Disadvantage 1}
- {Disadvantage 2}

### Option 2: {Alternative}
**Pros:**
- {Advantage 1}

**Cons:**
- {Disadvantage 1}

### Option 3: {Alternative}
**Pros:**
- {Advantage 1}

**Cons:**
- {Disadvantage 1}

## Rationale

{Explain why chosen option was selected over alternatives}

{Be specific: "PostgreSQL chosen because data is relational and team has SQL expertise"}

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- {Benefit 1}
- {Benefit 2}

**Negative:**
- {Limitation 1}
  - *Mitigation:* {How we'll address this}

**Neutral:**
- {Consideration 1}

## Related Decisions

- ADR-XXX: {Related decision}

## Notes

{Additional context, benchmarks, links, team discussions}
```

**File naming:**
```
docs/adrs/adr-{NUMBER}-{kebab-case-title}.md

Examples:
- docs/adrs/adr-001-database-selection.md
- docs/adrs/adr-002-orm-choice.md
- docs/adrs/adr-003-multi-tenancy-strategy.md
```

---

### Step 7: Verify ADR Quality

---

## Using This Skill

**From Winston subagent:**
```bash
/winston *create-adr "packages/backend/src/schema.prisma"
/winston *create-adr "Choose between REST and GraphQL"
```

**Directly:**
```bash
Use create-adr skill with context: "Analyze authentication strategy in src/auth/"
```

---

## Philosophy

ADRs are **living documentation** that:
- **Preserve context** for future developers
- **Document tradeoffs** honestly
- **Explain "why"** not just "what"
- **Guide future decisions** through patterns

Good ADRs prevent "why did we do this?" questions 6 months later.
