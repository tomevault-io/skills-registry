# Create PRD Skill

## Purpose

Create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRD) from high-level product ideas. This skill guides systematic requirements gathering, market analysis, feature definition, and success metrics documentation to produce PRDs ready for architecture design or epic breakdown.

**Core Principles:**
- Structured requirements elicitation
- Market-driven feature prioritization
- Clear success metrics and KPIs
- User-centric design approach
- Supports both greenfield (new products) and brownfield (existing systems) contexts

## Prerequisites

- Product vision or initial concept defined
- Access to stakeholder input (if available)
- Understanding of target market and users
- workspace/ directory exists for PRD storage

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering

**Action:** Elicit product vision, objectives, and constraints through structured inquiry.

**Key Activities:**
1. **Product Vision & Value Proposition**
   - What problem does this solve?
   - What value does it provide to users?
   - What makes it unique or different?

2. **Target Users & Personas**
   - Who are the primary users?
   - What are their goals, needs, pain points?
   - What user segments exist?

3. **Business Objectives**
   - What are the business goals?
   - How does this align with strategy?
   - What's the expected ROI or impact?

4. **Constraints & Considerations**
   - Timeline constraints
   - Budget limitations
   - Technical constraints
   - Regulatory requirements
   - Team capabilities

**Example Questions:**
```
- "What problem are we solving for users?"
- "How will users discover and access this?"
- "What success looks like in 6 months?"
- "What are we explicitly NOT building?"
```

**Output:** Core requirements documented (vision, users, objectives, constraints)

**See:** `references/elicitation-guide.md` for comprehensive elicitation techniques

---

### Step 2: Market Analysis

**Action:** Analyze competitive landscape and market positioning.

**Key Activities:**
1. **Competitive Landscape**
   - Who are the direct competitors?
   - Who are indirect competitors or alternatives?
   - What are their strengths/weaknesses?

2. **Market Positioning**
   - How do we differentiate?
   - What's our unique value proposition?
   - What market segment do we target?

3. **Go-to-Market Considerations**
   - Distribution channels
   - Pricing strategy (if applicable)
   - Marketing approach
   - Launch strategy

4. **Market Trends**
   - Relevant industry trends
   - Technology trends
   - User behavior trends

**Example Analysis:**
```
Competitive Landscape:
- Direct: [Competitor A] (strength: enterprise features, weakness: poor UX)
- Indirect: [Alternative B] (users use spreadsheets instead)

Differentiation:
- Simple, intuitive UX (vs competitor complexity)
- Mobile-first design (vs desktop-only competitors)
- AI-powered automation (unique capability)
```

**Output:** Market analysis section for PRD

**See:** `references/market-analysis-template.md` for detailed framework

---

### Step 3: Feature Definition

**Action:** Define and prioritize features using MoSCoW method.

**Key Activities:**
1. **Identify Core Features**
   - What must the product do? (Must-haves)
   - What should it do? (Should-haves)
   - What could it do? (Could-haves)
   - What won't it do? (Won't-haves)

2. **Feature Specifications**
   - Brief description of each feature
   - User value/benefit
   - Dependencies between features
   - Technical complexity estimate (if known)

3. **MoSCoW Prioritization**
   - **Must Have:** Critical features, MVP blockers
   - **Should Have:** Important but not launch blockers
   - **Could Have:** Nice-to-haves, future enhancements
   - **Won't Have:** Explicitly out of scope

4. **Feature Validation**
   - Does each feature solve user problem?
   - Is each feature aligned with objectives?
   - Are must-haves achievable within constraints?

**Example Feature Definition:**
```
MUST HAVE (MVP):
1. User Registration & Login
   - Users can create accounts with email/password
   - Enables personalization and data security
   - Depends on: Database, authentication service

2. Dashboard Overview
   - Users see key metrics at a glance
   - Provides immediate value on login
   - Depends on: Data collection, visualization

SHOULD HAVE:
3. Advanced Filtering
   - Users can filter data by multiple criteria
   - Improves data discovery
   - Depends on: Dashboard, search infrastructure

COULD HAVE:
4. Data Export (CSV, PDF)
   - Users can export reports
   - Convenience feature, not core value
   - Depends on: Dashboard, report generation

WON'T HAVE (v1):
5. Real-time Collaboration
   - Out of scope for v1, planned for v2
   - Significant technical complexity
```

**Output:** Prioritized feature list with specifications

**See:** `references/moscow-prioritization-guide.md` for detailed prioritization framework

---

### Step 4: Success Metrics

**Action:** Define measurable success criteria and KPIs.

**Key Activities:**
1. **User Adoption Metrics**
   - Sign-ups, active users (DAU/MAU/WAU)
   - User retention (D1, D7, D30 retention)
   - User engagement (sessions, time-on-site)
   - Feature adoption rates

2. **Business Impact Metrics**
   - Revenue (if applicable)
   - Conversion rates
   - Cost savings
   - Market share
   - Customer satisfaction (NPS, CSAT)

3. **Technical Performance Metrics**
   - Page load time
   - API response time
   - Uptime/availability
   - Error rates
   - Scalability metrics

4. **Success Criteria**
   - Specific targets for each metric
   - Timeframes for achievement
   - How metrics will be measured
   - Baseline vs target values

**Example Success Metrics:**
```
USER ADOPTION:
- 1,000 sign-ups in first month
- 60% D7 retention
- 40% MAU engagement

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- 70% conversion rate (free → paid)
- NPS score >40
- $100K ARR by month 6

TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE:
- <2s page load time (p95)
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- <1% error rate
```

**Output:** Success metrics and KPIs documented

**See:** `references/success-metrics-framework.md` for comprehensive metrics catalog

- Brownfield: `docs/brownfield-prd.md` (if updating existing system)

**Validation:**
- All required sections present
- Features prioritized with clear MoSCoW categories
- Success metrics specific and measurable
- Assumptions and risks documented
- Ready for next phase (architecture or epic breakdown)

**Output:** Complete PRD document

**See:** `references/prd-template.md` for complete PRD template with all sections

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Greenfield Product (New Product)

**Context:** Creating PRD for entirely new product with no existing system.

**Approach:**
- Focus on user problem and market opportunity
- Emphasize differentiation and unique value
- Start with minimal MVP features
- Plan iterative releases

**See:** `references/greenfield-examples.md` for complete examples

---

### Scenario 2: Brownfield Product (Existing System)

**Context:** Creating PRD for enhancements to existing product.

**Approach:**
- Document current state briefly
- Focus on gaps and improvements
- Consider migration and compatibility
- Balance new features with technical debt

**Note:** For comprehensive brownfield PRD generation from codebase analysis, use `create-brownfield-prd` skill instead.

---

### Scenario 3: Insufficient Information

**Context:** Stakeholders haven't provided enough detail.

**Approach:**
1. Document known information
2. Create "Assumptions" section with reasonable assumptions
3. Create "Open Questions" section with specific questions
4. Mark PRD as "DRAFT - Pending Stakeholder Input"
5. Share with stakeholders for feedback

---

### Scenario 4: Too Many Features

**Context:** Stakeholders want everything in MVP.

**Approach:**
1. Apply strict MoSCoW prioritization
2. Identify true MVP (minimum viable)
3. Create phased roadmap (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
4. Use data/evidence to defend prioritization
5. Escalate if stakeholder insists on unrealistic scope

**See:** `references/scope-management-guide.md` for scope negotiation strategies

---

## Best Practices

1. **Be User-Centric** - Always frame features in terms of user value, not technical implementation
2. **Keep It Clear** - Use simple language, avoid jargon, be specific and concrete
3. **Prioritize Ruthlessly** - Not everything can be "must have"; be honest about MVP scope
4. **Be Data-Driven** - Use market research, user feedback, and metrics to validate decisions
5. **Document Assumptions** - Make implicit assumptions explicit to avoid misalignment later
6. **Stay Flexible** - PRD is a living document; expect it to evolve as you learn more
7. **Cross-Reference** - Link to other documents (architecture, task specs, user research)
8. **Get Feedback** - Share early drafts with stakeholders for validation and buy-in

## When to Escalate

**Escalate to stakeholders when:**
- Critical information missing (target users, business objectives)
- Conflicting requirements or priorities
- Unrealistic scope or timeline expectations
- Budget constraints conflict with must-have features
- Regulatory or compliance requirements unclear

**Escalate to architect when:**
- Technical feasibility of features uncertain
- Significant architectural decisions needed
- Integration requirements complex

**Use alternative skill when:**
- Existing codebase needs analysis → Use `create-brownfield-prd` skill
- PRD too large (>100 features) → Use `shard-document` skill after creation
- Interactive validation needed → Use `interactive-checklist` skill for PO review
