# Sprint Planning

Create comprehensive sprint plans by intelligently grouping estimated user stories based on team velocity, dependencies, priorities, and risk mitigation.

## Purpose

Transform backlog of estimated stories into actionable sprint commitments:
- Calculate effective capacity (velocity - buffer)
- Select stories respecting dependencies and priorities
- Balance workload and minimize risk
- Generate sprint plan with goals, metrics, and risk mitigation
- Support multi-sprint planning (roadmap view)

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Starting a new sprint (during Sprint Planning ceremony)
- Re-planning mid-sprint due to significant changes
- Creating multi-sprint roadmap (2-4 sprints ahead)
- Evaluating sprint capacity and feasibility
- Balancing team workload across multiple teams

This skill should NOT be used when:
- Stories are not yet estimated (use estimate-stories first)
- Stories lack acceptance criteria (use refine-story first)
- No historical velocity data (establish velocity first with 1-2 sprints)

## Prerequisites

- Stories created (via breakdown-epic skill)
- Stories estimated (via estimate-stories skill)
- Clear team velocity (historical average or initial estimate)
- Dependencies identified (in story files or epic summaries)

## Sequential Sprint Planning Process

Execute steps in order - each builds on previous analysis:

### Step 0: Load Configuration and Sprint Context

**Purpose:** Gather all inputs needed for sprint planning.

**Actions:**

1. Validate sprint parameters:
   - Sprint name (must be unique)
   - Velocity (must be > 0)
   - Plan ahead (1-4 sprints)
   - Buffer percentage (default 15%)

2. Load all eligible stories from `.claude/stories/`:
   - Filter: Status = "Ready" or "Backlog"
   - Filter: Has story points estimated
   - Filter: Has acceptance criteria

3. Load dependencies:
   - From story files (Dependencies section)
   - From epic summaries (dependency graphs)
   - Build dependency map

4. Calculate effective capacity:
   ```
   Effective Capacity = Velocity × (1 - Buffer)
   Example: 20 points × (1 - 0.15) = 17 points available
   ```

**Output:** Sprint context loaded with velocity, buffer, effective capacity, eligible stories, dependencies identified

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-0-output` for complete format and `sprint-planning-mechanics.md` for capacity calculations

---

### Step 1: Prioritize and Sort Stories

**Purpose:** Create prioritized list respecting business value and dependencies.

**Sorting Criteria (in order):**

1. **Priority Level** (P0 > P1 > P2 > P3)
2. **Dependency Order** (blockers before blocked)
3. **Risk Score** (high-risk early for discovery)
4. **Story Points** (smaller stories for momentum)

**Output:** Stories prioritized and sorted by priority level, dependency order, risk score, story points

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-1-output` for complete sorted backlog example and `story-selection-algorithm.md` for sorting logic

---

### Step 2: Select Stories for Sprint

**Purpose:** Fill sprint capacity with highest-value stories respecting constraints.

**Selection Algorithm:**

1. Start with P0 stories in dependency order
2. Add story if:
   - All dependencies already in sprint OR completed
   - Points fit within remaining capacity
   - Doesn't create incomplete feature (orphaned dependencies)
3. Continue with P1, then P2 stories
4. Stop when capacity reached or no more valid stories

**Output:** Stories selected for sprint respecting capacity, dependencies, feature completeness | Total points, utilization percentage, remaining capacity

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-2-output` for complete selection example and `story-selection-algorithm.md` for selection rules

---

### Step 3: Validate Dependencies

**Purpose:** Ensure no broken dependencies in sprint plan.

**Validation Checks:**

1. **Blocker Check:** All blocking stories either:
   - Included in current sprint (before blocked story)
   - Already completed (status = Done)

2. **Feature Completeness:** Avoid partial features:
   - If story A blocks B and C, either include all or none
   - Don't leave dependent stories orphaned

3. **Cross-Sprint Dependencies:** For multi-sprint plans:
   - Dependencies can span sprints (A in Sprint 1, B in Sprint 2)
   - But must be in correct order

**Output:** Dependencies validated, all blocking relationships satisfied, no orphaned dependencies, feature completeness maintained

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-3-output` for complete validation examples including edge cases

---

### Step 4: Identify Risks and Mitigation

**Purpose:** Surface sprint risks and plan mitigation.

**Risk Categories:**

1. **Capacity Risk:** Sprint over/under-committed
   - Over: >95% utilization (no buffer for unknowns)
   - Under: <75% utilization (team under-utilized)

2. **Dependency Risk:** Critical path dependencies
   - Long chains (A → B → C → D)
   - Single blocker affecting many stories

3. **Technical Risk:** High-risk stories in sprint
   - Stories with risk score > 6 (from estimation)
   - Unproven technology or approach

4. **Scope Risk:** Too many P0 stories
   - Sprint becomes "all or nothing"
   - No flexibility for adjustments

**Output:** Sprint risks assessed by category (capacity/dependency/technical/scope), overall risk level, mitigation strategies identified

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-4-output` for detailed risk assessment example and `sprint-risk-assessment.md` for scoring methodology

---

### Step 5: Define Sprint Goal

**Purpose:** Articulate clear, measurable sprint goal.

**Sprint Goal Formula:**
```
[Action Verb] [Feature/Outcome] so that [Business Value]
```

**Examples:**
- "Implement core authentication so that users can securely access the platform"
- "Enable user profile management so that users can personalize their experience"
- "Complete payment integration so that customers can purchase products"

**Good Sprint Goals:**
- **Specific:** Clear what will be delivered
- **Measurable:** Can verify if goal achieved
- **Valuable:** Business value is clear
- **Achievable:** Realistic given velocity
- **Focused:** 1-2 main themes, not scattered

**Poor Sprint Goals:**
- ❌ "Complete as many stories as possible"
- ❌ "Work on authentication and profiles and settings and..."
- ❌ "Make progress on the backlog"

**Output:** Sprint goal defined following formula ([Action] [Feature] so that [Business Value]), success criteria specified, goal validated (specific/measurable/valuable/achievable/focused)

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-5-output` for complete goal examples and `sprint-goals-and-metrics.md` for goal patterns

---

### Step 6: Calculate Sprint Metrics

**Purpose:** Provide quantitative sprint health indicators.

**Key Metrics:**

1. **Commitment:** Total story points committed
2. **Utilization:** Percentage of velocity used
3. **P0 Coverage:** Percentage of P0 stories included
4. **Dependency Depth:** Longest dependency chain
5. **Risk Score:** Weighted average of story risks

**Output:** Sprint metrics calculated including capacity (velocity/buffer/commitment/utilization), stories (total/priority breakdown), dependencies (relationships/longest chain), risk (average score/high-risk count/overall level)

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-6-output` for complete metrics example with all fields

---

### Step 7: Generate Sprint Plan Document

**Purpose:** Create comprehensive sprint plan file.

**File:** `.claude/sprints/sprint-{sprint-name}-{date}.md`

**Output:** Sprint plan document generated with sections: Sprint Goal, Committed Stories table, Sprint Metrics, Risks and Mitigation, Sprint Schedule, Definition of Done

**File:** `.claude/sprints/sprint-{name}-{date}.md`

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-7-output` for complete sprint plan document template with all sections

---

### Step 8: Multi-Sprint Planning (Optional)

**Purpose:** Plan 2-4 sprints ahead for roadmap visibility.

**When to Use:**
- plan_ahead parameter > 1
- Creating quarterly roadmap
- Long-range feature planning

**Process:**
1. Plan Sprint 1 (as above)
2. Mark Sprint 1 stories as "allocated"
3. Repeat Steps 1-7 for Sprint 2 with remaining stories
4. Continue for Sprint 3, 4 as needed

**Output:** Multiple sprint plans generated, total roadmap points, stories distributed across sprints, files created for each sprint

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-8-output` for multi-sprint roadmap example and `sprint-planning-mechanics.md` for algorithm

---

### Step 9: Present Sprint Plan Summary

**Purpose:** Communicate sprint plan clearly to team.

**Output:** Sprint plan summary with sprint name/dates, commitment details (stories/points/utilization), sprint goal, top stories list, risk summary, sprint plan file path, next steps

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-9-output` for complete summary format

---

## Integration with Other Skills

**Before Sprint Planning:**
- `breakdown-epic` → Create stories from epics
- `refine-story` → Ensure stories are sprint-ready
- `estimate-stories` → Estimate story points

**After Sprint Planning:**
- `implement-feature` → Implement stories from sprint
- `review-task` → Quality check completed stories
- (Next sprint) → `sprint-plan` again with updated velocity

---

## Best Practices

Respect velocity (10-15% buffer) | Honor dependencies (never break chains) | Focus on value (P0/P1 first) | Balance risk (mix high/low risk stories) | Complete features (avoid half-done work) | Review and adapt (update velocity based on actuals)

**See:** `sprint-goals-and-metrics.md` for detailed planning best practices
