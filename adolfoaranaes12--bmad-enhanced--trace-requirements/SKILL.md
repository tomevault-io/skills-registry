# Requirements Traceability Analysis

Perform **bidirectional requirements traceability analysis** ensuring every acceptance criterion is implemented and tested. Creates audit-ready traceability matrix showing complete chain: Requirements → Implementation → Tests.

## Purpose

Create comprehensive traceability documentation that demonstrates:
- **Forward traceability:** AC → Implementation (with file/line evidence)
- **Backward traceability:** Tests → AC (with test scenario mapping)
- **Gap identification:** Missing implementation or test coverage
- **Severity assessment:** CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on risk and impact
- **Coverage metrics:** Implementation coverage, test coverage, traceability score
- **Quality gate impact:** Prediction of gate status (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL)

**Key Capabilities:**
- Evidence-based verification with file paths, line ranges, code snippets
- Integration with risk-profile (risk-informed gap severity)
- Integration with test-design (test-to-requirement mapping)
- Audit-ready documentation for compliance
- Actionable recommendations with effort estimates

## When to Use This Skill

**Best Used:**
- During implementation review to verify all requirements addressed
- Before quality gate to ensure completeness
- During audit preparation to demonstrate traceability
- After test-design to map tests to requirements
- When coverage gaps need identification and prioritization

**Integration Points:**
- Reads task specification for acceptance criteria
- Reads risk profile for risk-informed gap severity (optional)
- Reads test design for test-to-requirement mapping (optional)
- Reads actual implementation files for evidence
- Reads test files for test coverage verification

**Triggers:**
- User asks to "trace requirements", "check coverage", "verify AC implementation"
- Before quality gate (proactively suggest)
- During code review (verify completeness)

## Traceability Concepts

**Forward Traceability (AC → Implementation):** Maps each AC to implementation evidence (file, function, code snippet) | Status: ✅ Implemented, ⚠️ Partial, ❌ Not Implemented, ❓ Unclear

**Backward Traceability (Tests → AC):** Maps each test to ACs it validates | Status: ✅ Tested, ⚠️ Partial, ❌ Not Tested, 🔄 Indirect

**Gap Severity:** CRITICAL (9): Security/data integrity/core functionality | HIGH (6-8): Important requirements/P0 tests | MEDIUM (3-5): Minor requirements/P1 tests | LOW (1-2): Nice-to-have/P2 tests

**See:** `references/templates.md` for complete examples and classification details

## SEQUENTIAL Skill Execution

**CRITICAL:** Do not proceed to next step until current step is complete

### Step 0: Load Configuration and Context

**Purpose:** Load project configuration, task specification, and related assessments

**Actions:**

1. **Load configuration from `.claude/config.yaml`:**
   - Extract quality settings (assessmentLocation)
   - Extract risk score threshold (for gap severity assessment)

2. **Get task file path from user:**
   - Example: `.claude/tasks/task-006-user-signup.md`
   - Verify file exists and is readable

3. **Read task specification:**
   - Extract task ID, title, type
   - Load objective and context
   - **Load Acceptance Criteria** (primary traceability source)
   - Load Implementation Record section (files created/modified)
   - Load Quality Review section (if exists)

4. **Load related assessments (optional but enhances analysis):**
   - Risk profile: `.claude/quality/assessments/{task-id}-risk-*.md` (for gap severity)
   - Test design: `.claude/quality/assessments/{task-id}-test-design-*.md` (for test mapping)

5. **Identify implementation files:**
   - From task spec "Implementation Record" section
   - Files created/modified during implementation
   - Line ranges for each change

6. **Prepare output:**
   - Output directory: `.claude/quality/assessments/`
   - Output file: `{task-id}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
   - Template: `.claude/templates/trace-requirements.md` (if exists)

**Output:** Configuration loaded, task spec loaded with AC count, related assessments checked (risk profile/test design), implementation files identified, output path set

**Halt If:** Config missing, task file not found, no ACs, cannot create output

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-0-configuration-loading-output` for complete format

---

### Step 1: Build Forward Traceability Matrix (AC → Implementation)

**Purpose:** Map each acceptance criterion to its implementation evidence

**Actions:**

1. **For each acceptance criterion:**
   - Extract AC from task specification
   - Example: "AC-1: User can sign up with email and password"

2. **Search implementation files for evidence:**
   - Read each file from Implementation Record
   - Search for relevant code implementing the AC
   - Record file paths, line ranges, function/class names
   - Extract code snippets as evidence (5-10 lines context)

3. **Classify implementation status:**
   - ✅ **Implemented:** Clear evidence found in code
   - ⚠️ **Partial:** Some evidence but incomplete (e.g., validation missing)
   - ❌ **Not Implemented:** No evidence found
   - ❓ **Unclear:** Code exists but unclear if it satisfies AC

4. **Record evidence:** File paths, line ranges, function names, code snippets (5-10 lines) for each AC

5. **Calculate implementation coverage:**
   ```
   Implementation Coverage = (Implemented + 0.5 × Partial) / Total AC × 100%
   ```

**Output:** Forward traceability complete, AC counts by status, implementation coverage %

**Halt If:** Cannot read implementation files, >50% ACs unclear

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-1-forward-traceability-output` for complete format and examples

---

### Step 2: Build Backward Traceability Matrix (Tests → AC)

**Purpose:** Map each test to the acceptance criteria it validates

**Actions:**

1. **Identify test files:**
   - From test-design assessment (if available)
   - From Implementation Record (test files created)
   - From convention: `**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.spec.ts`, `**/__tests__/*`

2. **For each test file, extract test cases:**
   - Read test file
   - Extract test names from `it()`, `test()`, `describe()` blocks
   - Extract test scenarios (Given-When-Then if present)

   Extract test names from `it()`, `test()`, `describe()` blocks

3. **Map tests to acceptance criteria:**
   - Analyze test name and assertions
   - Determine which AC(s) the test validates
   - A single test can validate multiple ACs
   - An AC typically has multiple tests (happy path, edge cases, errors)

   Map tests to ACs (analyze test name + assertions, single test can validate multiple ACs)

4. **Classify test coverage:**
   - ✅ **Tested:** AC has at least one test validating it
   - ⚠️ **Partial:** AC has tests but not all scenarios covered (e.g., only happy path)
   - ❌ **Not Tested:** AC has no tests
   - 🔄 **Indirect:** AC tested indirectly through E2E or other tests

5. **Calculate test coverage:**
   ```
   Test Coverage = (Tested + 0.5 × Partial) / Total AC × 100%
   ```

**Output:** Backward traceability complete, tested AC counts, total tests, test coverage %

**Halt If:** None (proceed even if no tests, will generate gaps)

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-2-backward-traceability-output` for complete format

---

### Step 3: Identify Coverage Gaps

**Purpose:** Identify and classify gaps in implementation and test coverage with severity ratings

**Actions:**

1. **Identify implementation gaps:**
   - ACs with status: Not Implemented, Partial, or Unclear
   - Document missing functionality
   - Estimate impact and effort

   Document missing functionality, estimate impact and effort

2. **Identify test gaps:**
   - ACs with test coverage: Not Tested or Partial
   - Document missing test scenarios
   - Identify missing edge cases, error cases, security tests

   Document missing test scenarios, identify edge cases/error cases

3. **Classify gap severity:**
   Use risk profile (if available) to inform severity:

   - **CRITICAL (Score 9):**
     - Security requirement not implemented or tested
     - Data integrity requirement missing
     - Core functionality not implemented
     - High-risk area (from risk profile) not tested

   - **HIGH (Score 6-8):**
     - Important requirement not implemented
     - Security test missing (but implementation exists)
     - Performance requirement not validated
     - P0 test missing

   - **MEDIUM (Score 3-5):**
     - Minor requirement not implemented
     - Edge case test missing
     - P1 test missing
     - Partial implementation without full test coverage

   - **LOW (Score 1-2):**
     - Nice-to-have requirement missing
     - P2 test missing
     - Documentation-only gap

4. **Cross-reference with risk profile (if available):**
   - Gaps in high-risk areas → Increase severity
   - Gaps with existing mitigation → Decrease severity
   - Gaps without test coverage for high-risk area → CRITICAL

5. **Calculate gap metrics:**
   ```
   Total Gaps = Implementation Gaps + Test Gaps
   Critical Gaps = Gaps with severity CRITICAL
   High Gaps = Gaps with severity HIGH
   Medium Gaps = Gaps with severity MEDIUM
   Low Gaps = Gaps with severity LOW

   Gap Coverage = (Total AC - Total Gaps) / Total AC × 100%
   ```

**Output:**
```
⚠ Coverage gaps identified
⚠ Total Gaps: {count}
⚠ Critical: {count} (Security/core functionality issues)
⚠ High: {count} (Important requirements missing)
⚠ Medium: {count} (Minor gaps, edge cases)
⚠ Low: {count} (Nice-to-have items)
⚠ Gap Coverage: {percentage}%
```

**Halt Conditions:**
- More than 50% implementation gaps (incomplete implementation, not ready for traceability)

**Reference:** See [gap-analysis.md](references/gap-analysis.md) for gap classification and severity assessment

### Step 4: Create Traceability Matrix

**Purpose:** Build comprehensive bidirectional traceability matrix combining all data

**Actions:**

1. **Build full traceability matrix (table format):**
   ```markdown
   | AC | Requirement | Implementation | Tests | Gaps | Status |
   |----|-------------|----------------|-------|------|--------|
   | AC-1 | User can sign up with email and password | ✅ signup.ts:15-42 | ✅ 3 tests (P0) | None | ✅ Complete |
   | AC-2 | Password must be at least 8 characters | ✅ validators/auth.ts:23 | ⚠️ 1 test (missing edge cases) | GAP-2 (MEDIUM) | ⚠️ Partial |
   | AC-3 | Email must be validated | ✅ signup.ts:40, email.ts:12 | ✅ 2 tests (P1) | None | ✅ Complete |
   | AC-4 | Rate-limit login attempts | ❌ Not implemented | ❌ No tests | GAP-1 (HIGH) | ❌ Incomplete |
   ```

2. **Generate detailed entries for each AC:**
   ```markdown
   ## AC-1: User can sign up with email and password

   **Implementation Status:** ✅ Implemented

   **Implementation Evidence:**
   - **File:** src/routes/auth/signup.ts:15-42
   - **Function:** handleSignup()
   - **Description:** Implements signup endpoint accepting email/password,
                      hashing password, creating user, sending verification email
   - **Code Snippet:** [5-10 lines showing implementation]

   **Test Coverage:** ✅ Tested

   **Test Evidence:**
   1. **Test:** "should create user with valid email and password"
      - **File:** src/routes/auth/__tests__/signup.test.ts:12-24
      - **Type:** Integration, Priority: P0
      - **Scenario:** Given valid inputs, When signup, Then user created

   2. **Test:** "should return 400 for invalid email format"
      - **File:** src/routes/auth/__tests__/signup.test.ts:26-35
      - **Type:** Integration, Priority: P0
      - **Scenario:** Given invalid email, When signup, Then 400 error

   **Coverage Status:** ✅ Complete
   - Implementation: ✅ Complete
   - Tests: ✅ Complete (3 tests covering happy path, validation, errors)
   - Gaps: None
   ```

3. **Generate gap details:** Document each gap with severity, impact, required action, effort, priority

4. **Calculate overall traceability score:**
   ```
   Traceability Score = (
     (Implementation Coverage × 0.5) +
     (Test Coverage × 0.4) +
     (Gap Coverage × 0.1)
   )

   Example:
   - Implementation Coverage: 85%
   - Test Coverage: 80%
   - Gap Coverage: 90% (10% gaps)

   Traceability Score = (85 × 0.5) + (80 × 0.4) + (90 × 0.1)
                      = 42.5 + 32 + 9
                      = 83.5%
   ```

**Output:** Matrix complete with entry counts, traceability score

**Halt If:** None

**See:** `references/templates.md#complete-traceability-matrix-example` for matrix format

---

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations

**Purpose:** Provide actionable recommendations for closing gaps and improving traceability

**Actions:**

1. **Prioritize gaps:**
   Sort by:
   1. Severity (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
   2. Priority (P0 → P1 → P2)
   3. Effort (Small → Medium → Large)

2. **Generate action plan:** Prioritized actions (P0/P1/P2) with impact, effort, required actions, tests

3. **Quality gate impact assessment:** Determine status (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL), provide reasoning, list actions to achieve PASS with effort estimates

4. **Best practices:** Future task guidance (TDD, reference AC IDs, update traceability), current task guidance (close P0 gaps, document waivers, re-run after fixes)

**Output:** Recommendations with P0/P1/P2 counts, effort estimates, quality gate prediction

**Halt If:** None

**See:** `references/templates.md` for recommendation formats and action plans

---

### Step 6: Generate Traceability Report and Present Summary

**Purpose:** Create comprehensive traceability report and present concise summary to user

**Actions:**

1. **Load template (if exists):**
   - Read `.claude/templates/trace-requirements.md`
   - Use default structure if template missing

2. **Populate template variables:**
   - Metadata: task ID, title, date, assessor
   - Metrics: implementation coverage, test coverage, traceability score
   - Counts: total AC, total gaps, critical/high/medium/low gaps
   - Data: traceability matrix, detailed entries, gap details, recommendations

3. **Generate file path:**
   - Format: `.claude/quality/assessments/{taskId}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
   - Example: `.claude/quality/assessments/task-006-trace-20251029.md`
   - Create directory if needed

4. **Write traceability report:**
   - Complete report with all sections
   - Validate all template variables replaced
   - No placeholder text remaining

5. **Present concise summary:** Task metadata, coverage metrics (implementation/test/gap/traceability score), gap breakdown by severity, quality gate impact + reasoning, actions to achieve PASS with estimates, report path, next steps

**Output:** Report generated at output path, summary presented

**Halt If:** File write fails

**See:** `references/templates.md#step-4-complete-summary-format` for full summary output

## Integration with Other Skills

### Integration with risk-profile

**Input:** Risk scores for high-risk areas | **Usage:** Gaps in high-risk areas → increase severity (e.g., HIGH → CRITICAL), missing tests for high-risk → CRITICAL

### Integration with test-design

**Input:** Test scenarios with priorities (P0/P1/P2), AC-to-test mappings | **Usage:** Validate test-to-AC mappings, identify missing test scenarios, use test priorities for gap severity

### Integration with quality-gate

**Output to quality-gate:**
- Traceability score (contributes to gate decision)
- Coverage gaps (may block gate if critical)
- Action items for closing gaps
- Evidence for requirements traceability dimension

**How quality-gate uses it:**
```markdown
Quality Gate Decision:
1. Check traceability score:
   - Score ≥95% → PASS
   - Score 80-94% → CONCERNS
   - Score <80% → FAIL

2. Check critical gaps:
   - 0 critical gaps → continue evaluation
   - 1+ critical gaps → CONCERNS (or FAIL if security)

3. Check overall coverage:
   - Implementation ≥90% AND Test ≥85% → PASS
   - Implementation ≥80% OR Test ≥70% → CONCERNS
   - Implementation <80% OR Test <70% → FAIL
```

## Best Practices

1. **Reference AC IDs in Code:**
   ```typescript
   // Implements AC-1: User signup with email and password
   export async function handleSignup(req: Request, res: Response) {
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Reference AC IDs in Commits:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: implement user signup (AC-1, AC-2, AC-3)"
   ```

3. **Reference AC IDs in Test Names:**
   ```typescript
   it('should satisfy AC-1: user can sign up with email and password', async () => {
     // ...
   });
   ```

4. **Run Before Code Review:**
   - Check traceability before marking task as "Review"
   - Close gaps before requesting review
   - Re-run trace-requirements after closing gaps

5. **Use for Audit Trail:**
   - Demonstrate requirements → implementation → test chain
   - Show evidence for compliance
   - Cross-reference with risk profile for risk coverage

## Configuration

### In `.claude/config.yaml`

```yaml
quality:
  # Quality assessment location
  assessmentLocation: ".claude/quality/assessments"

  # Risk score threshold for gap severity amplification
  riskScoreThreshold: 6  # Gaps in areas with risk ≥6 get higher severity

  # Traceability thresholds
  traceability:
    implementationCoverage: 90    # Minimum implementation coverage
    testCoverage: 85               # Minimum test coverage
    traceabilityScore: 80          # Minimum overall traceability score
```

### Template File

`.claude/templates/trace-requirements.md` - Template for traceability report output (optional)
