# Validate Architecture

## Purpose

Validate architecture documents for completeness, quality, and adherence to best practices. Generates comprehensive validation report with quality score, identified gaps, and prioritized recommendations for improvement.

**Core Principles:**
- **Comprehensive checklists:** Cover all architectural dimensions
- **Objective scoring:** Consistent, repeatable quality measurement
- **Actionable feedback:** Specific, prioritized improvements
- **Adapt to context:** Different criteria for different project types

---

## Prerequisites

- Architecture document exists (docs/architecture.md or specified path)
- Architecture follows standard structure (see create-architecture skill)

---

## Workflow

### 1. Load Architecture Document

**Action:** Read architecture document using bmad-commands

Execute:
```bash
python .claude/skills/bmad-commands/scripts/read_file.py \
  --path {architecture_file} \
  --output json
```

**Parse document to extract:**
- Present sections
- Technology stack components
- ADRs count and quality
- NFRs coverage
- Security considerations
- Scalability mentions

---

### 2. Detect Project Type

**Auto-detect from architecture content:**

**Frontend indicators:**
- Component architecture section
- State management discussion
- UI/routing mentions
- Frontend technologies (React, Vue, etc.)

**Backend indicators:**
- API design section
- Service layer architecture
- Database/data layer
- Backend technologies (Node, Python, etc.)

**Fullstack indicators:**
- Both frontend and backend sections
- Integration/API contract sections
- End-to-end authentication flow
- Full stack technologies (Next.js, etc.)

**If unable to detect:** Prompt for project_type parameter

---

- Poor ADR quality
- Minimal security details
- No scalability planning

**Minor Gaps (nice-to-have):**
- Incomplete deployment details
- Missing diagrams
- Light monitoring discussion

**Priority:** Critical → Major → Minor

---

### 12. Generate Recommendations

**Based on identified gaps, provide actionable recommendations:**

**Recommendation format:**
```markdown
**Priority:** Critical | Major | Minor

**Action:** Add missing sections, re-validate

---

## Strict Mode

**When enabled (--strict):**
- Minimum score: 80 (instead of 70)
- All major gaps must be addressed
- ADR quality rigorously checked
- More detailed NFR validation

**Use strict mode for:**
- Production systems
- High-complexity projects
- Compliance-sensitive applications
- Enterprise deployments

---

## Best Practices

1. **Run early and often** - Validate during architecture creation, not after
2. **Address critical gaps immediately** - Don't proceed with critical gaps
3. **Iterate** - Re-validate after addressing gaps
4. **Use as checklist** - Reference validation checklist while creating architecture
5. **Don't over-optimize** - Score of 70-80 is usually sufficient for implementation

## When to Escalate

Escalate to user when:
- Architecture file not found or unreadable
- Unable to detect project type automatically
- Score is below 50 (major rework needed)
- Critical compliance issues detected
- Architecture deviates significantly from standards
