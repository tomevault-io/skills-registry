# Safe File Operations

**CRITICAL:** Before running any potentially destructive commands (mv, rm, cp with overwrite, etc.), ALWAYS verify the environment first:

1. **Check working directory:** Run `pwd` to confirm you're in the expected location
2. **Verify file existence:** Use `ls -la <file>` to check files exist and are what you expect
3. **Check file types:** Verify if files are regular files or symlinks before operations
4. **Test on one file first:** For batch operations, test the command on a single file before looping
5. **Verify after operations:** Check the result with `ls -la` to confirm success

**Example safe workflow:**
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS:
mv CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md  # Blind execution

# DO THIS INSTEAD:
pwd                      # Verify location
ls -la CLAUDE.md         # Confirm file exists
mv CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md   # Execute
ls -la AGENTS.md         # Verify success
```

**For batch operations:**
```bash
# Test on ONE file first
cd /path/to/first/dir && pwd && ls -la CLAUDE.md && mv CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md && ls -la AGENTS.md

# Only after confirming success, proceed with batch
for dir in ...; do ...; done
```

The user is trusting you with their files. Be careful!
