# Plan Issue

Create an implementation plan for GitHub issue #$ARGUMENTS.

## Steps

1. **Read the issue** — Run `gh issue view $ARGUMENTS` to get the issue title, body, and labels.

2. **Grasp the project status** — Run `gh issue list` to see open issues and understand where this issue fits in the overall project roadmap.

3. **Understand the context** — Based on the issue description, explore the codebase to understand:
   - Which files are relevant
   - Current architecture and patterns (refer to CLAUDE.md)
   - Dependencies and constraints

4. **Clarify unknowns** — If the issue is unclear, missing information, or there are multiple valid approaches, ask the user before proceeding. Do not make assumptions on ambiguous points.

5. **Draft the plan** — Write a concrete implementation plan using the template in [plan-template.md](plan-template.md). The plan should be:
   - Specific enough that another developer (or Claude) can implement it without ambiguity
   - Scoped to only what the issue requires — explicitly call out what is out of scope
   - Written in English (project convention)

6. **Write to the issue** — Replace the issue description with the plan using `gh issue edit $ARGUMENTS --body "<plan>"`. Use a HEREDOC for the body to preserve formatting. The plan IS the issue description — generate all sections (Summary, Scope, etc.) from scratch based on the issue title and your investigation.

## Guidelines

- Keep the plan minimal. Do not over-engineer or add unnecessary steps.
- If the issue is unclear or missing information, always ask the user rather than assuming.
- Reference actual file paths discovered during exploration, not guessed paths.
- For each file change, specify whether it is Create, Modify, or Delete.
- Do not include full code in the plan — describe what changes are needed and why.
- Code snippets are acceptable when they clarify intent (e.g., type definitions, key structures).
