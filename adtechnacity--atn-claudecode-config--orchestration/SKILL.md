# Orchestration

End-to-end workflow for planning, executing, and completing multi-step development tasks.

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Write Plan** | "write a plan", "create implementation plan", spec/requirements ready | `workflows/write-plan.md` |
| **Orchestrate Tasks** | "break into tasks", after plan is written/approved | `workflows/orchestrate.md` |
| **Execute Plan** | "execute the plan", "implement the plan" in separate session | `workflows/execute.md` |
| **Subagent Dev** | "execute with subagents", implement in current session | `workflows/subagent-dev.md` |
| **Parallel Dispatch** | 2+ independent tasks, no shared state | `workflows/parallel-dispatch.md` |
| **Finish Branch** | implementation complete, ready to merge/PR/cleanup | `workflows/finish-branch.md` |

## Typical Pipeline

```
WritePlan → Orchestrate (auto, includes execution via Teams/ParallelDispatch) → FinishBranch
```

**Key principle:** Every plan MUST be broken into a prioritized task graph with dependencies before execution. `WritePlan` automatically flows into `Orchestrate`. All execution paths use Claude Tasks (TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList) for progress tracking.

**Alternative execution paths** (only when user explicitly requests):
```
WritePlan → SubagentDev (sequential, same session) → FinishBranch
WritePlan → Execute (separate session) → FinishBranch
```

## Quick Decision

- **Have requirements, no plan yet?** → `WritePlan` (auto-flows into `Orchestrate`)
- **Have plan, need task graph + execution?** → `Orchestrate` (default — creates tasks, sets dependencies, executes in waves)
- **Want sequential execution with 2-stage review?** → `SubagentDev` (builds task graph, then executes one-by-one)
- **Executing plan in a new/separate session?** → `Execute` (builds task graph, executes in waves)
- **Multiple independent tasks?** → `ParallelDispatch`
- **All tasks done?** → `FinishBranch`
