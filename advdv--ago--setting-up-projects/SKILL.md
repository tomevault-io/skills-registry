Sets up a new project with tooling and infrastructure using mise.

# Prerequisites
Make sure the following is pre-setup, if not ask the user to do so:
- mise must be installed and in PATH: https://mise.jdx.dev 
- a mise.toml must be present, amp (ampcode.com) must be installed using mise, if not ask the user to do so

# Behavior
- When asked to setup a project, do not DO anything else except follow the steps below. 
- If you want to do things that are not in the steps below, you MUST ask the user for permission.
- It might be that everything is already setup, in that case: do not do anything.

# Steps
Perform the following steps. For each step first check if the step was already performed. If so, skip it but
make sure that steps still need to be performed can be performed still.

1. Use mise to install Go: `mise u go`
2. Use `go mod init` to init the main module
3. Use mise to install Node.js 22 (and npm): `mise u node@22`
4. Use mise to install the AWS CDK toolkit: `mise u npm:aws-cdk`
5. Use mise to install the AWS CLI: `mise u aws-cli`

# Install the 'ago' CLI
6. Use mise to install the 'ago' CLI: `GOPROXY=direct mise u "go:github.com/advdv/ago/cmd/ago@latest"`
    - **IMPORTANT**: You MUST use `GOPROXY=direct` prefix to bypass the Go module proxy cache and get the absolute latest commit. Do NOT omit this.
    - **IMPORTANT**: You MUST First uninstall any existing version: `GOPROXY=direct mise uninstall "go:github.com/advdv/ago/cmd/ago@latest" 2>/dev/null || true`
        - Uninstall is needed because mise won't reinstall if `@latest` is already present
    - Then install: `GOPROXY=direct mise u "go:github.com/advdv/ago/cmd/ago@latest"`
        - `GOPROXY=direct` bypasses the Go module proxy cache to get the absolute latest commit
7. Add mise tasks to `mise.toml` that proxy all `ago` CLI commands. For each ago subcommand (e.g., `ago check tests`, `ago dev fmt`), add:
    ```toml
    [tasks."<group>:<command>"]
    run = "ago <group> <command>"
    ```
    - Run `ago --help` and `ago <subcommand> --help` to discover all available commands
    - Use the same naming hierarchy (e.g., `check:tests`, `dev:fmt`)    

# Setup Linting
6. Use mise to install golangci-lint: `mise u golangci-lint`
7. Use the librarian to copy the ".golangci.yml" file from the github.com/advdv/ago repository

## Setup infrastructure-as-code using AWS CDK
7. Use the AWS CDK cli to initialize a Go CDK project in the `/infra/cdk/cdk` directory (use `cdk init` with appropriate options for a Go app)
8. Make sure it is a dedicated go module with its own go.mod
9. Make sure to add the following to the cdk's .gitignore:
    - "cdk" so the cdk binary doesn't get committed when compiled.
10. Clean up the CDK project by removing:
    - the _test file that was created as part of the setup
    - the README.md that was created as part of the setup
11. Use the "setting-up-cdk-app" skill to replace the boilerpalte CDK code. 
    - If no existing "Shared" and "Deployment" structs exist, create empty ones in /infra/cdk

## Run the check task
