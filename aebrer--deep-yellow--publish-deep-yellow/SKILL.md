# Publish Deep Yellow

Full publish workflow for the Deep Yellow Godot game. All commands run from the project root.

## Prerequisites

- Must be on `master` branch with all changes merged
- Previous version tag exists (workflow auto-increments)
- Butler installed at `/home/drew/.local/bin/butler`
- Godot export presets configured (Linux, Windows Desktop, Web)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine version

```bash
cd /home/drew/projects/deep_yellow
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1
```

Ask Drew what version to tag (patch, minor, or major bump), or infer from the scope of changes since last tag.

### Step 2: Export all platforms (headless)

```bash
cd /home/drew/projects/deep_yellow
godot --headless --export-release "Linux"
godot --headless --export-release "Windows Desktop"
godot --headless --export-release "Web"
```

### Step 3: Push to itch.io with butler

```bash
VERSION=v0.X.Y  # from step 1
/home/drew/.local/bin/butler push build/linux aebrer/deep-yellow:linux --userversion $VERSION
/home/drew/.local/bin/butler push build/windows aebrer/deep-yellow:windows --userversion $VERSION
/home/drew/.local/bin/butler push build/web aebrer/deep-yellow:html5 --userversion $VERSION
```

### Step 4: Verify uploads

```bash
/home/drew/.local/bin/butler status aebrer/deep-yellow
```

### Step 5: Create tar.gz archives for GitHub release

```bash
cd /home/drew/projects/deep_yellow/build
tar czf deep_yellow_${VERSION}_linux.tar.gz -C linux .
tar czf deep_yellow_${VERSION}_windows.tar.gz -C windows .
tar czf deep_yellow_${VERSION}_web.tar.gz -C web .
```

### Step 6: Create git tag and push

```bash
cd /home/drew/projects/deep_yellow
git tag $VERSION
git push origin $VERSION
```

### Step 7: Create GitHub release

```bash
gh release create $VERSION \
  /home/drew/projects/deep_yellow/build/deep_yellow_${VERSION}_linux.tar.gz \
  /home/drew/projects/deep_yellow/build/deep_yellow_${VERSION}_windows.tar.gz \
  /home/drew/projects/deep_yellow/build/deep_yellow_${VERSION}_web.tar.gz \
  --title "$VERSION — Release Title" \
  --notes "Release notes here"
```

Use a HEREDOC for multi-line release notes. Include a link to the itch.io page:
`[aebrer.itch.io/deep-yellow](https://aebrer.itch.io/deep-yellow)`

### Step 8: Generate itch.io devlog post

Butler can't post devlogs — Drew will paste this manually. Generate a devlog markdown file at `/tmp/deep-yellow-devlog-${VERSION}.md` for copy-pasting into itch.io.

**Process:**

1. Read the GitHub release notes just created in Step 7
2. Read the commit log since the previous tag: `git log --oneline <prev_tag>..<new_tag>`
3. Write a devlog post that:
   - Uses the release title as the heading
   - Rewrites the changelog into player-facing language (not commit messages)
   - Groups changes into sections like "New Features", "Improvements", "Bug Fixes" as appropriate
   - Keeps the tone consistent with previous devlogs (conversational, technical but accessible)
   - Omits internal/chore changes that don't affect players (dead code removal, doc updates, CI changes)
   - Ends with a brief "What's Next" sentence or two if there are obvious open issues to mention
4. Save to `/tmp/deep-yellow-devlog-${VERSION}.md`
5. Suggest tags for the post

Drew will review, edit if needed, and paste into the itch.io devlog form.

## Notes

- Export preset names are case-sensitive: "Linux", "Windows Desktop", "Web"
- Butler uses delta compression — subsequent pushes are fast
- Use absolute paths for `gh release create` asset arguments
- Archives go in `build/` alongside the platform directories
- `gh pr edit` may fail with GraphQL error — use `gh api` directly if needed (see CLAUDE.md)
