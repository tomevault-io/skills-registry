# Claude Code Ecosystem Architect (cc-eco-techt)

## What This Skill Does
Transforms Claude into a master architect capable of designing and implementing complete Claude Code ecosystem solutions. Analyzes requirements, recommends optimal component combinations, and generates production-ready skills, commands, hooks, and subagents based on the comprehensive documentation system.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Requirements Analysis & Architecture Design
- Analyze project scope, team size, and workflow patterns
- Map requirements to optimal component combinations
- Design token-efficient architectures
- Plan progressive complexity (start simple, add complexity as needed)

### 2. Component Generation Engine
- Generate AGENTS.md with proper project context
- Create SKILL.md files with auto-triggering patterns
- Build slash commands with argument handling
- Design hooks with proper event context
- Architect subagents with isolated contexts

### 3. Integration & Optimization
- Ensure components work together harmoniously
- Optimize for token usage and performance
- Create proper file structures and naming
- Design escalation patterns (simple → complex)

## When This Skill Auto-Triggers
Claude will automatically use this skill when detecting requests for:
- "create a workflow for"
- "build a skill to"
- "design an agent for"
- "automate this process"
- "set up project structure"
- "optimize my claude setup"
- "create templates for"

   - Parse user request for core requirements
   - Identify frequency and usage patterns
   - Determine target audience and skill level
   - Anticipate failure modes and edge cases

2. **Map to Ecosystem Components**
   - Automatic triggering needed? → Skill
   - Specialist task with isolation? → Subagent
   - User-triggered workflow? → Command
   - Validation/automation needed? → Hook
   - External dependencies? → MCP integration

3. **Design Token Architecture**
   - Estimate token costs for each component
   - Plan progressive disclosure strategies
   - Design efficient loading sequences
   - Plan context window management

### Phase 2: Component Generation
1. **Generate Primary Component**
   - Create the main component file structure
   - Implement proper YAML frontmatter
   - Add comprehensive documentation
   - Include examples and usage patterns

2. **Generate Supporting Components**

   - Design supporting commands for workflows
   - Add validation hooks for quality gates
   - Plan integration coordination

3. **Create Integration Layer**
   - Design component interaction patterns
   - Create escalation and delegation flows
   - Plan error recovery mechanisms
   - Document usage workflows

### Phase 3: Optimization & Validation
1. **Token Optimization**
   - Review component sizes and efficiency
   - Optimize loading and caching patterns
   - Plan context cleanup procedures
   - Design progressive complexity

2. **Integration Testing Plan**
   - Define component interaction tests
   - Plan error handling validation
   - Test edge cases and failure modes
   - Validate user experience flows

## Example Generation Patterns

### Example 1: Testing Automation Workflow
**User Input:** "I need a comprehensive testing workflow for our React TypeScript project"

**Generated Solution:**
1. **Main Skill:** `react-testing-automation`
   - Auto-triggers on test file changes
   - Orchestrates unit, integration, and E2E tests
   - Progressive disclosure of results
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines

2. **Command:** `/run-tests [type] [coverage] [report]`
   - Manual test execution with arguments
   - Support for different test suites
   - Coverage reporting options
