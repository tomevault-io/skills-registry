## Step-by-Step Guide

### Phase 1: Discovery and Inventory (5 minutes)

#### Step 1.1: Platform-Specific Discovery
MCP Manager scans each platform for MCP servers:
```bash
# Claude Code discovery
./scripts/discover-claude.sh

# Factory Droid discovery
./scripts/discover-factory.sh

# Antigravity discovery
./scripts/discover-antigravity.sh

# Gemini discovery
./scripts/discover-gemini.sh
```

#### Step 1.2: Server Classification
Each discovered server is classified by:
- **Type**: Database, API, File system, AI model, Custom
- **Complexity**: Simple, Intermediate, Advanced
- **Dependencies**: Required services and libraries
- **Security Level**: Public, Private, Sensitive

#### Step 1.3: Inventory Generation
```bash
# Generate comprehensive inventory
./scripts/generate-inventory.sh

# Outputs to `resources/inventory/`:
# - server-list.csv: Complete server catalog
# - dependency-graph.json: Server dependency mapping
# - platform-matrix.md: Cross-platform compatibility
# - security-scan.md: Security assessment report
```

### Phase 2: Health Monitoring Setup (3 minutes)

#### Step 2.1: Health Check Configuration
```bash
# Setup health monitoring for all servers
./scripts/setup-monitoring.sh

# Monitors:

# - Error rates and exception patterns
# - Memory and resource usage
# - API rate limiting and throttling
# - Database connection health
# - Network connectivity
```

#### Step 2.2: Quality Scoring System
MCP Manager calculates quality scores based on:
- **Performance**: Response times and throughput
- **Reliability**: Uptime and error rates
- **Security**: Authentication, encryption, access controls
- **Documentation**: API docs, examples, README quality
- **Maintenance**: Update frequency and issue resolution

#### Step 2.3: Alert Configuration
```bash
# Configure real-time alerts
./scripts/setup-alerts.sh

# Alert channels:
# - Email notifications for critical issues
# - Slack integration for team notifications
# - Webhook calls for automated responses
# - Dashboard updates for visual monitoring
```

### Phase 3: Continuous Monitoring (Ongoing)

#### Step 3.1: Real-Time Health Checks
```bash
# Start continuous monitoring
./scripts/monitor-continuous.sh

# Checks performed every 60 seconds:
# - Server ping and response validation
# - API endpoint functionality testing
# - Database connectivity and query performance
# - File system access and permissions
# - Authentication token validation
# - Rate limit and quota monitoring
```

#### Step 3.2: Performance Metrics Collection
```bash
# Collect detailed performance data
./scripts/collect-metrics.sh

# Metrics gathered:
# - Response time distributions
# - Request success/error rates
# - Concurrent connection limits
# - Memory and CPU usage patterns
# - Network latency and bandwidth
# - Database query performance
```

#### Step 3.3: Automated Reporting
```bash
# Generate automated reports
./scripts/generate-reports.sh --daily

# Report types:
# - Daily health summary
# - Weekly performance trends
# - Monthly quality assessments
# - Quarterly security audits
# - Custom ad-hoc reports
```

### Phase 4: Troubleshooting and Maintenance (10 minutes)

#### Step 4.1: Automated Diagnosis
```bash
# Diagnose server issues automatically
./scripts/diagnose.sh --server server-name

# Diagnosis capabilities:
# - Configuration validation
# - Dependency checking
# - Network connectivity testing
# - Authentication troubleshooting
# - Performance bottleneck identification
# - Log analysis for error patterns
```

#### Step 4.2: Automated Repair
```bash
# Attempt automated repairs
./scripts/auto-repair.sh --server server-name

# Repairs performed:
# - Configuration file corrections
# - Dependency installation and updates
# - Permission fixes
# - Service restart and recovery
# - Cache clearing and cleanup
# - SSL certificate renewal
```

#### Step 4.3: Maintenance Scheduling
