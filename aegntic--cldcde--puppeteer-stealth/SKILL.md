# Puppeteer Stealth Skill

A comprehensive web automation skill that implements ethical browser automation with anti-bot evasion capabilities using Puppeteer Extra and Stealth plugin.

## Features

- **Stealth Mode**: Uses puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth to avoid detection
- **Randomized Configurations**: User-agent rotation, viewport variation, and fingerprint randomization
- **Cookie Management**: Import/export cookies for session persistence
- **CAPTCHA Detection**: Screenshot capture and analysis for CAPTCHA identification
- **Human-like Behavior**: Realistic delays and interaction patterns
- **Flexible Modes**: Support for both headless and headful browser operations
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of Cloudflare challenges and common anti-bot measures
- **Ethical Compliance**: Built-in rate limiting and respectful scraping practices

## Usage

```javascript
// Basic stealth scraping
const result = await skill.stealthScrape({
  url: 'https://example.com',
  selector: '.content',
  options: { headless: true, captureScreenshots: true }
});

// Cookie management
await skill.saveCookies('session-cookies.json');
await skill.loadCookies('session-cookies.json');

// Human-like interaction
await skill.humanClick('.button');
await skill.humanType('#search', 'query', { delay: 100 });
```
