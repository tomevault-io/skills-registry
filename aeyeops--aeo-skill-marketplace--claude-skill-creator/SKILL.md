# Claude Skill Creator

Comprehensive guide for authoring high-quality Claude skills.

## CRITICAL RULES - READ BEFORE CREATING ANY SKILL

**These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Violating them wastes tokens and breaks skills.**

### Rule 1: START SMALL
- **Maximum files for new skill: 3** (SKILL.md + 2 supporting)
- Only add more files after the skill works

### Rule 2: NO PLACEHOLDERS
- **NEVER create empty files**
- **NEVER reference files you haven't written**
- If you write `See [guide.md]`, then guide.md MUST exist with content

### Rule 3: COMPLETE BEFORE LINKING
- Write the referenced file BEFORE adding the link to SKILL.md
- Test that each referenced file exists and has content

### Rule 4: FILE COUNT LIMITS

| Complexity | Max Files | When to Use |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Simple | 1-3 | Most skills |
| Moderate | 4-6 | Multi-domain skills |
| Complex | 7-10 | Rare, justify each file |
| **15+ files** | **NEVER** | **You are over-engineering** |

### Before Creating ANY File, Ask:
1. Can this fit in SKILL.md? - Do that
2. Will I complete this file RIGHT NOW? - If no, don't create it
3. Am I anticipating future needs? - Stop. Solve current problem only.

**Detailed anti-pattern examples**: See [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md)

## Latest Official Documentation

Before creating skills, fetch current Anthropic specifications:

### Primary: Context7
1. Resolve: `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` with "claude code skills"
2. Fetch: `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` with ID `/websites/code_claude_en` topic "skills"

### Fallback: WebFetch
```
WebFetch url="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills"
prompt="Extract skill file structure, frontmatter requirements, and best practices"
```

**Complete retrieval guide**: See [references/doc-retrieval.md](references/doc-retrieval.md)

---

## Core Principles

### The Context Window is a Public Good

Your skill shares context with system prompt, conversation history, other skills, and user requests.

**Loading Model:**
- **Level 1** (Always): `name` + `description` (~100 tokens per skill)
- **Level 2** (When triggered): SKILL.md body (<5k tokens)
- **Level 3+** (As needed): Referenced files (effectively unlimited)

**Best Practice:** Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines.

---

## Frontmatter Structure

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What it does. Use when [triggers].
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob  # Optional: restrict tool access
---
```

### Requirements

| Field | Limit | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `name` | 64 chars | Lowercase, hyphens only. No "anthropic"/"claude" |
| `description` | 1024 chars | Third person. Include WHAT + WHEN |
| `allowed-tools` | Optional | Comma-separated tool list |

### Naming Convention (Gerund Form)

Use verb + -ing:
- `processing-pdfs` not `pdf-processor`
- `analyzing-spreadsheets` not `spreadsheet-analyzer`
- `generating-commits` not `commit-generator`

### Description Formula

```
[What the skill does]. Use when [trigger conditions].
```

**Good:**
```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF documents or form automation.
```

**Bad:**
```yaml
description: Helps with documents and files when needed.
```

---

## File Organization

### Directory Patterns

**Simple (1 file):**
```
my-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

**With References (3-4 files):**
```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md
├── reference.md
└── examples.md
```

**With Scripts (5-7 files):**
```
pdf-skill/
├── SKILL.md
├── FORMS.md
└── scripts/
    ├── analyze_form.py
    └── fill_form.py
```

**Complete guide**: See [references/file-organization.md](references/file-organization.md)

### What NOT to Include

- README.md (skill IS the documentation)
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- Test files
- License files (belongs in plugin)

---

## Progressive Disclosure

Claude navigates skills like a filesystem, reading files only when needed.

**Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md:**
```
SKILL.md
├── references to → advanced.md     ✓
├── references to → reference.md    ✓
└── references to → examples.md     ✓
```

**Avoid nested references:**
```
SKILL.md → advanced.md → details.md → more.md    ✗
```

**For files >100 lines:** Include a table of contents.

**Complete patterns**: See [references/progressive-disclosure.md](references/progressive-disclosure.md)

---

## MCP Tool References

Always use fully qualified tool names: `ServerName:tool_name`

```markdown
Use `Salesforce:query` for SOQL queries.
Use `BigQuery:bigquery_schema` for table schemas.
Use `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` for documentation.
```

**Why:** Tool names conflict across servers. Qualified names ensure correct invocation.

**Complete guide**: See [references/mcp-tools.md](references/mcp-tools.md)

---

## 6-Step Creation Process

### Step 1: Understand
Gather concrete usage examples. Ask: "What would trigger this skill?"

### Step 2: Plan
Identify resources needed. **STOP AND CHECK:** Can this be 1-3 files?

### Step 3: Initialize
Run `python scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-dir>`

### Step 4: Edit
Implement SKILL.md and referenced files. **Every file you reference must exist.**

### Step 5: Package
Run `python scripts/package_skill.py <skill-dir>` to validate and package.

### Step 6: Iterate
Test with realistic scenarios. Refine based on Claude's navigation patterns.

---

## Testing

Use the three-agent pattern:
1. **Claude A** (Author): Describes desired behavior
2. **Claude B** (Tester): Uses skill in realistic scenarios
3. **You** (Observer): Watch navigation, refine based on observations

**Watch for:**
- Unexpected file access order
- Missed references
- Ignored files (may be unnecessary)

**Complete guide**: See [references/testing.md](references/testing.md)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Doesn't Load

1. Check YAML frontmatter syntax (opening/closing `---`)
2. Verify file location: `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
3. Check description specificity - is it triggering?

### Broken References

1. Verify all referenced files exist
2. Check paths use forward slashes (`/`)
3. Ensure no placeholder files

### Multiple Skills Conflict

1. Make descriptions more specific
2. Use "Use when [specific scenario]" phrases
3. Consider merging related skills

---

## Security

**Only use skills from trusted sources:**
- Skills you created
- Skills from Anthropic
- Verified, audited skills

Skills can direct Claude to invoke tools in unintended ways. Audit untrusted skills thoroughly.

---

## Quick Reference

- Write third-person descriptions
- Use gerund naming (`processing-pdfs`)
- Complete files before referencing

### Don'ts

- Reference files you haven't written
- Use generic descriptions
- Nest references more than one level

---

## Claude CLI Plugin Commands

The Claude CLI has direct plugin management commands (not just interactive `/plugin`):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add <source>    # Add marketplace from URL, path, or GitHub repo
claude plugin marketplace list            # List configured marketplaces
claude plugin marketplace remove <name>   # Remove a marketplace
claude plugin marketplace update [name]   # Update marketplace(s)
claude plugin validate <path>             # Validate plugin/marketplace manifest
claude plugin install <plugin>            # Install plugin from marketplace
```

**Supported marketplace sources:**
- Local paths: `/path/to/marketplace` or `./relative/path`
- GitHub repos: `owner/repo` (shorthand)
- Git URLs: `https://github.com/owner/repo.git`
- Direct marketplace.json URLs

**Not supported:** Azure DevOps URLs (use local clone instead)
