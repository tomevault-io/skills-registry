description: Read the supplemental project documentation module Use when this capability is needed.
metadata:
  author: agent0ai

Use this skill when you need project orientation before editing or answering architecture questions.

helper
- Import `/mod/_core/documentation/documentation.js`
- `read("path/to/file.md")` reads a nested markdown doc relative to `docs/`
- `url("path/to/file.md")` builds the resolved `/mod/...` URL for a doc file

workflow
- Start with the built-in documentation index below unless you already know the exact doc path
- Use one focused `read("path/to/file.md")` call instead of loading many large docs blindly
- Treat `/README.md` as the public product source of truth for the project pitch, quick starts, release links, community links, and DeepWiki discovery
- After orientation, walk the DOX chain from `/AGENTS.md` to the owning `AGENTS.md` file and then inspect code when needed
- For visual or modal work, confirm `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/visual/AGENTS.md` before changing dialog shells, buttons, cards, popovers, or other shared UI primitives
- For dashboard panel creation, panel manifests, or panel-navigation helpers, start with `app/modules-and-extensions.md`
- Keep the repo's frontend-first rule in mind while reading: backend docs explain constraints and existing contracts, not default permission to edit `server/`
- If the change appears to require backend work and the user did not explicitly ask for backend edits, ask for permission and explain the security, integrity, or stability reason before changing backend files
- When you change a stable contract or workflow, update the relevant DOX `AGENTS.md` files, including affected `Child DOX Index` entries, and the matching docs in `/mod/_core/documentation/docs/`
- When you add, remove, rename, or substantially repurpose a doc file, update this skill's in-file index in the same session

recommended starting points
- overall system shape: `architecture/overview.md`

- documentation rules: `architecture/documentation-system.md`
- frontend runtime and layers: `app/runtime-and-layers.md`
- admin agent runtime: `app/admin-agent-runtime.md`
- modules, routing, extensions, or dashboard panels: `app/modules-and-extensions.md`
- browser-side Hugging Face testing: `app/huggingface-browser-runtime.md`
- browser-side WebLLM testing: `app/webllm-browser-runtime.md`
- spaces and widgets: `app/spaces-and-widgets.md`
- overlay agent runtime: `agent/onscreen-agent-runtime.md`
- memory or promptinclude-backed agent memory: `agent/memory-and-prompt-includes.md`
- prompt or execution protocol: `agent/prompt-and-execution.md`
- skills or this documentation surface: `agent/skills-and-documentation.md`
- server routing or pages: `server/request-flow-and-pages.md`
- server jobs or maintenance loops: `server/jobs-and-maintenance.md`
- app-file APIs: `server/api/files.md`
- module, login, or runtime endpoints: `server/api/modules-and-runtime.md`
- auth and sessions: `server/auth-and-sessions.md`
- layered filesystem, `CUSTOMWARE_PATH`, or writable-layer history: `server/customware-layers-and-paths.md`
- CLI commands or runtime params: `cli/commands-and-runtime-params.md`

examples
Reading the frontend runtime docs
_____javascript
const documentation = await import("/mod/_core/documentation/documentation.js")
return await documentation.read("app/runtime-and-layers.md")
