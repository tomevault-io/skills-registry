# Jest Test

Write, review, and improve Jest tests following production-quality patterns and best practices for TypeScript and JavaScript projects.

Before starting, consult [references/jest-guide.xml](references/jest-guide.xml) -- a comprehensive playbook covering core principles, the full matcher catalog, async testing patterns, mocking strategies, data-driven tests, error handling, anti-patterns, and CI/CD integration. Reference it throughout the workflow.

## Workflow Overview

```
Analyze --> Plan --> Write Tests --> Review
    ^                    |             |
    +---- Revise --------+             |
                         +-- Fix ------+
```

Follow steps 1-4 in order. If the user provides existing tests for review, skip to Step 4.

## Step 1: Analyze

Read the source code to understand what needs testing. Identify:

- **Functions and methods** -- Public API surface that needs coverage
- **Dependencies** -- External modules, services, or APIs that need mocking (see `<mocking>` in jest-guide.xml)
- **Async operations** -- Promises, async/await, callbacks that need special handling (see `<async_testing>`)
- **Edge cases** -- Error paths, boundary values, null/undefined inputs
- **State management** -- Setup/teardown needs for consistent test state

If the user provides a file path, read it. If they describe functionality without providing code, ask them to share the relevant source files.

## Step 2: Plan

Determine the test strategy before writing code. Decide:

**What to test:**
- Test behavior, not implementation details (see `<anti_patterns>` in jest-guide.xml)
- Cover the happy path, error paths, and edge cases
- Prioritize public API surface over internal helpers

**Test organization** (see `<core_principles>` for structure templates):
- One `describe` block per function, class, or logical grouping
- Descriptive test names that read as specifications: `'should return empty array when no items match filter'`
- Group related tests with nested `describe` blocks

**Mocking strategy** (see `<mocking>` for the full pattern catalog):
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, file system)
- Mock expensive operations (network calls, heavy computation)
- Do NOT mock the unit under test
- Use `jest.spyOn` when you need to verify calls while keeping the original behavior

**Coverage goals** (see `<coverage_requirements>` in `<core_principles>`):
- Services: 98% across all metrics
- Repositories/data access: 95%
- Utilities: 90%
- Global minimum: 95% statements, branches, functions, lines

## Step 3: Write Tests

Generate tests following the patterns in jest-guide.xml. Apply these rules consistently:

### Test structure

Every test file follows this skeleton:

```typescript
import { ServiceUnderTest } from '../service-under-test';

// Mock dependencies at the top
jest.mock('../dependency-module');

describe('ServiceUnderTest', () => {
  let service: ServiceUnderTest;
  let mockDependency: jest.Mocked<DependencyType>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Arrange: fresh instance and mocks for each test
    mockDependency = new DependencyModule() as jest.Mocked<DependencyType>;
    service = new ServiceUnderTest(mockDependency);
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
    jest.restoreAllMocks();
  });

  describe('methodName', () => {
    test('should return expected result for valid input', async () => {
      // Arrange
      mockDependency.fetch.mockResolvedValue(testData);
      // Act
      const result = await service.methodName(input);
      // Assert
      expect(result).toEqual(expected);
    });

    test('should throw when dependency fails', async () => {
      // Arrange
      mockDependency.fetch.mockRejectedValue(new Error('Network error'));
      // Act & Assert
      await expect(service.methodName(input)).rejects.toThrow('Network error');
    });
  });
});
```

### Choosing matchers

Select the right matcher from `<matchers>` in jest-guide.xml:

| Scenario | Matcher | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Primitive comparison | `toBe()` | Strict === equality |
| Object/array comparison | `toEqual()` | Deep equality, ignores undefined |
| Strict object comparison | `toStrictEqual()` | Includes undefined properties |
| Partial object match | `toMatchObject()` | Only checks specified keys |
| Array contains item | `toContain()` (primitives) / `toContainEqual()` (objects) | Subset checking |
| Floating point | `toBeCloseTo()` | Avoids precision errors |
| Error thrown | `toThrow()` | Wrap in `expect(() => ...)` for sync |

### Async tests

All async tests must include assertion counting (see `<async_testing>`):

```typescript
test('async operation', async () => {
  expect.assertions(1); // Prevents false positives
  const result = await service.fetchData();
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
});
```

For error cases, use `.rejects`:

```typescript
test('rejects on failure', async () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  await expect(service.fetchData()).rejects.toThrow('Network error');
});
```

### Mock cleanup

Always clean up mocks (see `<cleanup>` in `<mocking>`):

```typescript
afterEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();   // Reset call history
  jest.restoreAllMocks(); // Restore original implementations
});
```

### Data-driven tests

Use `test.each` for parameterized tests (see `<data_driven_testing>`):

```typescript
test.each([
  ['valid@email.com', true],
  ['invalid', false],
  ['', false],
])('validates email "%s" as %s', (email, expected) => {
  expect(isValidEmail(email)).toBe(expected);
});
```

### Forbidden patterns

Never include any of the patterns listed in `<forbidden_patterns>` in jest-guide.xml:
- No `.only` or `.skip` -- these break CI
- No empty test bodies -- every test must have assertions
- No real timers -- use `jest.useFakeTimers()` (see `<timer_mocking>`)
- No unhandled async -- always `await` and use `expect.assertions()`

## Step 4: Review

Audit tests (generated or user-provided) against the reference. Check each area and report findings.

### Anti-pattern scan

Check against every item in `<anti_patterns>` in jest-guide.xml:

- [ ] Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- [ ] Mocks are cleaned up in `afterEach`
- [ ] No real `setTimeout`/`setInterval` -- fake timers used instead
- [ ] All async operations are properly awaited
- [ ] No `.only`, `.skip`, or `.todo` in committed code

### Async safety

- [ ] Every async test has `expect.assertions(n)` or `expect.hasAssertions()`
- [ ] Promise rejections are tested with `.rejects.toThrow()`
- [ ] No floating promises (async calls without `await`)

### Mock hygiene

- [ ] `afterEach` includes `jest.clearAllMocks()` and/or `jest.restoreAllMocks()`
- [ ] Mocks are scoped to the narrowest level needed
- [ ] `jest.spyOn` used when original behavior should be preserved
- [ ] Module mocks use `jest.mock()` at the top of the file (hoisting)

### Coverage and completeness

- [ ] Happy path covered for all public methods
- [ ] Error paths tested (rejected promises, thrown exceptions)
- [ ] Edge cases covered (empty inputs, null/undefined, boundary values)
- [ ] Coverage meets thresholds from `<coverage_requirements>`

### CI readiness

Check against `<ci_cd>` quality gates:

- [ ] No `.only` / `.skip` / `.todo`
- [ ] No `console.log` statements in test files
- [ ] Coverage thresholds configured and met
- [ ] All async tests have assertion counts

Present review results as a checklist with pass/fail and specific fix recommendations.

## Examples

### Example 1: Writing tests for a service

User says: "Write tests for this UserService"

Actions:
1. Read the UserService source to identify methods, dependencies, and async operations
2. Plan: mock the UserRepository dependency, test CRUD methods, cover error paths
3. Generate a complete test file with describe/test blocks, proper mocking, async handling, and assertion counting
4. Verify no anti-patterns, all async tests have `expect.assertions()`, mocks cleaned up in `afterEach`

Result: A complete `user-service.test.ts` file with tests for each public method, mocked dependencies, error path coverage, and proper cleanup.

### Example 2: Reviewing existing tests

User says: "Review my test file for issues"

Actions:
1. Skip to Step 4 (Review)
2. Scan for anti-patterns: implementation testing, missing mock cleanup, real timers, unhandled async
3. Check async safety: assertion counts, proper await, rejects handling
4. Check mock hygiene: cleanup in afterEach, proper scoping
5. Present findings with specific line references and fixes

Result: A review report like:
- FAIL: Line 15 -- missing `expect.assertions()` in async test
- FAIL: Line 42 -- `setTimeout` used instead of fake timers
- WARN: No `afterEach` cleanup -- mock state may leak between tests
- PASS: All tests verify behavior, not implementation
- RECOMMENDATION: Add `test.each` for the repetitive validation tests on lines 60-90

### Example 3: Mocking guidance

User says: "How do I mock this external API client?"

Actions:
1. Read the source to understand the API client's interface
2. Show the relevant mocking pattern from `<mocking>` in jest-guide.xml
3. Provide a concrete example using `jest.mock()` for the module and `mockResolvedValue` / `mockRejectedValue` for async methods
4. Include cleanup pattern

Result: A focused code snippet showing module mock setup, typed mocks, return value configuration, and cleanup -- ready to paste into the test file.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests pass locally but fail in CI

Cause: Test order dependency -- a mock or state from one test leaks into another. Tests run in a different order in CI.
Solution: Add `afterEach(() => { jest.clearAllMocks(); jest.restoreAllMocks(); })` to every describe block. Run locally with `--runInBand` to reproduce order-dependent failures. Check for shared mutable state outside of `beforeEach`.

### Issue: Mock is not being used (original function still runs)

Cause: `jest.mock()` calls are hoisted to the top of the file, but the mock path may not match the import path exactly. Or `jest.doMock()` was used without a subsequent dynamic `require()`.
Solution: Ensure the path in `jest.mock('path')` exactly matches the import statement. For aliased paths (`@/services/...`), verify `moduleNameMapper` in Jest config. Check that the mock is defined before the module-under-test is imported.

### Issue: Async test times out

Cause: A promise is never resolved or rejected, or `done()` is never called in a callback-style test.
Solution: Check that all async operations are properly awaited. For callback tests, ensure `done()` is called in both success and error paths (wrap in try/catch). Add `expect.assertions(n)` to catch silent non-execution. Increase timeout if the operation is legitimately slow: `test('slow op', async () => {...}, 10000)`.

### Issue: Coverage threshold not met

Cause: Uncovered branches (often error paths, default switch cases, or early returns).
Solution: Run `jest --coverage` and inspect the HTML report at `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`. Look for red-highlighted lines -- these are uncovered. Common gaps: catch blocks, null checks, default cases in switch statements. Add targeted tests for each uncovered branch.
