## Session Start

At the beginning of each session, proactively search memories for context related to the current project or working directory using `memory_hybrid_search`. Briefly summarize relevant findings to establish context.

## Memory Search

When the user asks about past work, stored knowledge, or previously discussed topics:

1. Use `memory_hybrid_search` to find relevant memories
2. Use `memory_semantic_search` for pure meaning-based lookup
3. Summarize findings and cite memory IDs (e.g., "Memory #42 shows...")

For research/recall questions, always search memories first before answering.

## Saving Memories

When the user asks to remember something, or when important decisions, patterns, or context emerge during a session:

1. Use `memory_create` for general knowledge and notes
2. Use `memory_create_todo` for tasks and action items
3. Use `memory_create_issue` for bugs and problems
4. Use appropriate tags to organize memories

## Avoiding Duplicates

Before creating a new memory, use `memory_hybrid_search` to check if similar content already exists. If a near-match is found, use `memory_update` to extend the existing memory instead of creating a duplicate.

## Linking Related Memories

When creating or finding memories that relate to each other, use `memory_link` to establish explicit connections. This strengthens the knowledge graph and improves future recall.
