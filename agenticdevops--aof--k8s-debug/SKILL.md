- Pod is in CrashLoopBackOff or other error states
- Need to debug application behavior in containers
- Analyzing logs to understand failures
- Investigating pod networking issues
- Checking resource constraints or limits

## Skills & Capabilities

- Retrieve pod status and events from Kubernetes
- Analyze error patterns in logs
- Inspect resource usage and limits
- Suggest fixes based on common issues
- Identify pending pod issues

## Steps

1. **Get pod status** — `kubectl get pod {pod-name} -o wide`
2. **Check events** — `kubectl describe pod {pod-name}`
3. **Retrieve logs** — `kubectl logs {pod-name} --tail=100`
4. **Analyze patterns** — Look for OOMKilled, CrashLoop, ImagePullBackOff
5. **Check resources** — `kubectl top pod {pod-name}`
