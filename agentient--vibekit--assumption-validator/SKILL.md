# Assumption Validator

> "Make hidden assumptions visible; make visible assumptions testable."

Assumptions are the invisible architecture of every decision. This skill provides a systematic methodology for surfacing, classifying, validating, and stress-testing the assumptions that underlie decisions, strategies, plans, and architectures. The output is a RISK-ASSESSMENT artifact that transforms assumption risk into actionable guidance.

---

## 1. Purpose

### Core Value Proposition

Every decision rests on assumptions. Some are explicit and acknowledged. Many are implicit, hidden in the reasoning chain. The most dangerous are structural—embedded in how we frame the problem itself. This skill makes the invisible visible and the untested testable.

### Capabilities

| # | Capability | Phase | Value |
|---|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Extract explicit assumptions from subject documents | 2 | Capture what's acknowledged |
| 2 | Surface implicit assumptions through structured probing | 2 | Reveal hidden dependencies |
| 3 | Identify structural assumptions in problem framing | 2 | Expose framing blind spots |
| 4 | Classify assumptions by type and risk profile | 3 | Enable prioritization |
| 5 | Perform load-bearing analysis for criticality scoring | 3 | Focus on what matters |
| 6 | Map assumption dependencies | 3 | Understand cascade effects |
| 7 | Validate assumptions against available evidence | 4 | Assess confidence levels |
| 8 | Execute counterfactual analysis (what-if scenarios) | 4 | Stress-test under alternatives |
| 9 | Calibrate confidence with epistemic labels | 4 | Communicate uncertainty |
| 10 | Derive risks from unvalidated/invalid assumptions | 5 | Convert to actionable risks |
| 11 | Generate RISK-ASSESSMENT artifact | 5 | Standardized output |
| 12 | Provide go/no-go recommendation | 5 | Decision support |

## 2. When to Use

### Ideal Use Cases

| Scenario | Why Assumption Validation Matters |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Pre-commitment decision review** | Before committing resources, surface what you're betting on |
| **Strategy validation** | Strategies often embed untested market/competitive assumptions |
| **Investment due diligence** | Financial decisions rest on projections built on assumptions |
| **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** | Technical choices assume certain constraints and capabilities |
| **Product direction pivots** | Pivots invalidate old assumptions; what new ones are introduced? |
| **Risk assessments** | Risks often emerge from assumption failures |
| **Merger & acquisition analysis** | Synergy assumptions are notoriously optimistic |
| **Go-to-market plans** | Market assumptions may not survive contact with reality |
| **Capacity planning** | Growth assumptions drive infrastructure decisions |
| **Vendor selection** | Vendor capabilities are often assumed, not verified |

### Anti-Patterns (When NOT to Use)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Ineffective | Better Alternative |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Analysis paralysis** | Validating every assumption delays action forever | Set validation_intensity: light |
| **Reversible decisions** | Over-analyzing easily reversible choices wastes effort | Just decide and iterate |
| **Well-established facts** | Questioning gravity wastes time | Focus on genuine uncertainties |
| **Time-critical emergencies** | Fires need extinguishing, not philosophy | Use judgment, then debrief |
| **Exploratory research** | Early exploration should generate assumptions, not validate them | Use research-interviewer first |

### Phase 1: Subject Intake & Framing

**Purpose:** Understand what's being validated and establish clear boundaries.

**Steps:**

1. **Receive subject artifact**
   - Accept decision document, strategy brief, plan, ADR, or proposal
   - If verbal, request written summary or create one together
   - Note: Subject should be specific enough to identify assumptions

2. **Extract context metadata**
   - Subject type (decision, strategy, plan, architecture, investment, product_direction)
   - Time horizon (when does this need to succeed?)
   - Stakeholders (whose assumptions might be embedded?)
   - Decision reversibility (high-stakes or easily changed?)

3. **Define validation scope**
   - What's in scope for assumption analysis?
   - What's explicitly out of scope?
   - Are there protected assumptions (e.g., executive mandates)?

4. **Identify information sources**
   - Subject document(s)
   - Supporting materials
   - Domain experts available for consultation
   - Historical precedents

5. **Set validation intensity**
   - Light: Quick scan, top assumptions only
   - Standard: Balanced depth and coverage
   - Rigorous: Exhaustive, all techniques applied

6. **Confirm framing with stakeholder**
   - "We're validating assumptions in [subject] with [intensity] intensity."
   - "Scope includes [X], excludes [Y]."
   - "Time horizon is [Z]."

**Quality Gate:** Subject Framed
- [ ] Subject boundaries explicitly defined
- [ ] Context metadata captured
- [ ] Validation intensity confirmed
- [ ] Information sources identified

**Output:** Framed subject with boundaries and context

---

### Phase 2: Assumption Surfacing

**Purpose:** Extract all assumption types—explicit, implicit, and structural.

**Reference:** See `references/surfacing-techniques.md` for detailed protocols.

**Steps:**

1. **Scan for explicit assumptions**
   - Search subject document for assumption markers:
     - "We assume...", "Given that...", "Assuming..."
     - "This depends on...", "If [condition]..."
     - "We're betting that...", "Our hypothesis is..."
   - Document verbatim with source location
   - **See:** `references/assumption-taxonomy.md` §1 (Explicit)

2. **Probe for implicit assumptions**

   Apply surfacing techniques based on `assumption_depth`:

   | Technique | Question | Yields |
   |-----------|----------|--------|
   | **Inversion** | "What would have to be true for this to fail?" | Hidden dependencies |
   | **Five Whys** | "Why do we believe this? Why? Why?" | Reasoning chain foundations |
   | **Outsider Test** | "What would a skeptic question first?" | Non-obvious assumptions |
   | **Pre-mortem** | "It failed. What assumption was wrong?" | Failure-mode assumptions |
   | **Dependency Mapping** | "What does this depend on?" | Upstream assumptions |

   - **See:** `references/surfacing-techniques.md` for full technique protocols

3. **Surface structural assumptions** (if `assumption_depth: full_structural`)

   | Technique | Question | Yields |
   |-----------|----------|--------|
   | **Frame Questioning** | "Why did we frame this as X not Y?" | Framing assumptions |
   | **Missing Voices** | "Whose perspective is absent?" | Stakeholder blind spots |
   | **Scope Boundary Probe** | "Why is X out of scope?" | Scope assumptions |
   | **Alternative Structures** | "What if we organized around different dimensions?" | Structural alternatives |

   - **See:** `references/assumption-taxonomy.md` §3 (Structural)

4. **Document each assumption**

   For each assumption captured:
   ```
   - ID: A[n]
   - Statement: [Clear, falsifiable statement]
   - Type: EXPLICIT | IMPLICIT | STRUCTURAL
   - Source: [How it was identified]
   - Initial confidence: [0.0-1.0 estimate]
   ```

5. **Check for completeness**
   - Have we covered all sections of the subject document?
   - Have we applied minimum techniques per intensity level?
   - Are there obvious gaps in coverage?

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] **All Explicit Captured:** Document scan for assumption markers complete
- [ ] **Implicit Probe Done:** At least N surfacing techniques applied (N per intensity)
- [ ] **Structural Check:** Frame questioning performed (if full_structural)

**Output:** Raw assumption inventory (unclassified, unprioritized)

---

### Phase 3: Classification & Prioritization

**Purpose:** Categorize assumptions by type and score criticality for prioritization.

**Reference:** See `references/load-bearing-analysis.md` for scoring framework.

**Steps:**

1. **Assign assumption types**

   Classify each assumption into one or more types:

   | Type | Definition | Risk Level |
   |------|------------|------------|
   | **EXPLICIT** | Directly stated in subject document | Low (acknowledged) |
   | **IMPLICIT** | Required for conclusions but unstated | Medium (hidden) |
   | **STRUCTURAL** | Embedded in problem framing | High (invisible) |
   | **LOAD-BEARING** | If wrong, entire edifice collapses | Critical |
   | **CONTEXTUAL** | About environment/market/conditions | Variable |
   | **BEHAVIORAL** | About how people/systems will act | Medium-High |

   - **See:** `references/assumption-taxonomy.md` for detailed type definitions

2. **Perform load-bearing analysis**

   Score each assumption on four dimensions:

   | Dimension | Scale | Question |
   |-----------|-------|----------|
   | **Dependency (D)** | 1-5 | How many conclusions depend on this? |
   | **Reversibility (R)** | 1-5 | Can we recover if this is wrong? |
   | **Validation Cost (V)** | 1-5 | How hard is it to verify? (inverse) |
   | **Confidence (C)** | 0-1 | How confident are we currently? |

   **Priority Formula:**
   ```
   Priority = (D × (1 - C)) / V
   ```

   High dependency, low confidence, low validation cost = highest priority

   - **See:** `references/load-bearing-analysis.md` for scoring rubrics

3. **Map dependencies**

   For high-priority assumptions:
   - What other assumptions depend on this one?
   - What conclusions would be invalidated if wrong?
   - Are there assumption chains (A depends on B depends on C)?

4. **Identify load-bearing assumptions**

   Flag assumptions where:
   - Priority score > threshold (typically 2.0)
   - OR dependency score = 5 (everything depends on it)
   - OR labeled STRUCTURAL (framing assumptions)

5. **Rank and filter**

   - Sort by priority score descending
   - Per intensity level:
     - Light: Top 3
     - Standard: Top 5
     - Rigorous: All with priority > 1.0

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] **Types Assigned:** Every assumption has type classification
- [ ] **Load-Bearing Identified:** Top N critical assumptions flagged
- [ ] **Priority Scores:** All assumptions have priority scores

**Output:** Prioritized assumption list with scores and dependencies

---

### Phase 4: Validation & Stress-Testing

**Purpose:** Test assumptions against evidence and counterfactual scenarios.

**Reference:** See `references/validation-methods.md` and `references/what-if-framework.md`.

**Steps:**

1. **Select validation methods per assumption**

   Match methods to assumption characteristics:

   | Assumption Type | Recommended Methods |
   |-----------------|---------------------|
   | EXPLICIT | Evidence check, Cross-validation |
   | IMPLICIT | Counterfactual, Expert challenge |
   | STRUCTURAL | Frame alternatives, Outside perspective |
   | CONTEXTUAL | Historical precedent, Time decay test |
   | BEHAVIORAL | Stakeholder interviews, Incentive analysis |

   - **See:** `references/validation-methods.md` for method protocols

2. **Execute evidence check**

   For each prioritized assumption:

   | Evidence Quality | Weight | Description |
   |------------------|--------|-------------|
   | **Primary source** | 1.0 | Direct measurement, documentation |
   | **Secondary source** | 0.7 | Reported by credible third party |
   | **Expert opinion** | 0.6 | Domain expert judgment |
   | **Inference** | 0.4 | Logical derivation from other facts |
   | **Assumption** | 0.2 | Based on another assumption |

   - Document evidence found (or lack thereof)
   - Note evidence quality and source

3. **Run counterfactual analysis** (if `counterfactual_analysis: true`)

   For top load-bearing assumptions:

   ```
   WHAT-IF: [Assumption] is FALSE

   Immediate impacts:
   - [What breaks immediately?]

   Cascade effects:
   - [What else fails as a consequence?]

   Decision change:
   - [Would the decision/strategy change?]

   Impact magnitude: NEGLIGIBLE | MINOR | MODERATE | MAJOR | CATASTROPHIC
   ```

   - **See:** `references/what-if-framework.md` for structured protocol

4. **Calibrate confidence**

   Assign epistemic labels based on evidence:

   | Label | Confidence | Definition |
   |-------|------------|------------|
   | **VERIFIED** | 0.9-1.0 | Confirmed by direct evidence |
   | **LIKELY** | 0.7-0.9 | Strong indirect evidence |
   | **POSSIBLE** | 0.4-0.7 | Some supporting evidence |
   | **SPECULATIVE** | 0.1-0.4 | Limited evidence, mostly inference |
   | **UNKNOWN** | 0.0-0.1 | Insufficient basis for judgment |

   - **See:** `references/confidence-calibration.md` for calibration techniques

5. **Determine validation status**

   | Status | Criteria |
   |--------|----------|
   | **VALIDATED** | Confidence ≥ `confidence_threshold`, evidence quality ≥ 0.7 |
   | **PARTIAL** | Some evidence, but confidence < threshold |
   | **UNVALIDATED** | No evidence found, or conflicting evidence |
   | **INVALIDATED** | Evidence contradicts assumption |
   | **CONTESTED** | Multiple sources disagree |

6. **Document validation results**

   Per assumption:
   ```
   - Validation status: [status]
   - Confidence: [0.0-1.0]
   - Epistemic label: [label]
   - Evidence summary: [brief]
   - Counterfactual impact: [if run]
   - Validation method(s): [methods used]
   ```

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] **Top N Validated:** Top assumptions have validation results
- [ ] **Counterfactuals Run:** What-if scenarios for load-bearing assumptions
- [ ] **Confidence Calibrated:** All assumptions have epistemic labels

**Output:** Validated/invalidated assumptions with confidence levels

---

### Phase 5: Synthesis & Risk Assessment

**Purpose:** Compile findings into RISK-ASSESSMENT artifact with actionable recommendations.

**Reference:** See `templates/risk-assessment-output.md` for CONTRACT-08 format.

**Steps:**

1. **Derive risks from assumption status**

   Transform assumption findings into risks:

   | Assumption Status | Risk Derivation |
   |-------------------|-----------------|
   | INVALIDATED | Direct risk: "Assumption X is false" |
   | UNVALIDATED | Risk: "Assumption X may be false (unverified)" |
   | CONTESTED | Risk: "Disagreement on assumption X" |
   | Low confidence | Risk: "Uncertain assumption X (confidence: Y)" |
   | High dependency + any issue | Amplified risk due to cascade |

2. **Score each derived risk**

   Using SEVERITY-SCORING (RUBRIC-07):

   | Dimension | Scale | Weight |
   |-----------|-------|--------|
   | **Impact** | 1-4 (low→critical) | 0.5 |
   | **Likelihood** | 1-4 (rare→certain) | 0.3 |
   | **Detectability** | 1-4 (obvious→hidden) | 0.2 |

   Risk score = weighted sum

3. **Develop mitigation strategies**

   For high-scoring risks:

   | Strategy | When to Use |
   |----------|-------------|
   | **Avoid** | Remove dependency on assumption (redesign) |
   | **Transfer** | Shift risk to party who can validate |
   | **Mitigate** | Add safeguards, monitoring, fallbacks |
   | **Accept** | Document and proceed with awareness |

   Each mitigation should specify:
   - Actions required
   - Residual risk after mitigation
   - Owner and timeline (if applicable)

4. **Assess overall risk profile**

   | Risk Profile | Criteria |
   |--------------|----------|
   | **VERY HIGH** | Multiple critical risks, invalidated load-bearing assumptions |
   | **HIGH** | Critical risk present, or several high risks |
   | **MODERATE** | High risks present but mitigatable |
   | **LOW** | No high/critical risks, most assumptions validated |
   | **VERY LOW** | All key assumptions validated, minor risks only |

5. **Generate go/no-go recommendation**

   | Recommendation | When |
   |----------------|------|
   | **PROCEED** | Low/very low risk, assumptions validated |
   | **PROCEED_WITH_CAUTION** | Moderate risk, mitigations in place |
   | **SIGNIFICANT_CONCERNS** | High risk, key assumptions unvalidated |
   | **DO_NOT_PROCEED** | Very high risk, load-bearing assumptions invalid |

6. **Compile RISK-ASSESSMENT artifact**

   Structure per CONTRACT-08:
   - Subject reference and metadata
   - Assessment method (techniques used, assumptions surfaced)
   - Risk list with scores and mitigations
   - Summary with profile and recommendation

   - **See:** `templates/risk-assessment-output.md` for complete template

7. **Generate supporting artifacts**

   - Assumption Inventory: Complete catalog with validation status
   - Sensitivity Analysis: Impact magnitude per assumption

   - **See:** `templates/assumption-inventory-output.md`
   - **See:** `templates/sensitivity-analysis-output.md`

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] **Risks Derived:** Assumption-derived risks enumerated
- [ ] **Go/No-Go Issued:** Assessment concludes with recommendation

**Output:** RISK-ASSESSMENT (CONTRACT-08), Assumption Inventory, Sensitivity Analysis

---

## 5. Assumption Taxonomy

Six types of assumptions, ordered by visibility and risk:

### 5.1 EXPLICIT Assumptions

**Definition:** Directly stated in the subject document or explicitly acknowledged.

**Characteristics:**
- Visible in text ("We assume...", "Given that...")
- Author is aware of them
- Often documented in "Assumptions" section

**Detection Heuristics:**
- Text search for assumption markers
- Review formal "Assumptions" sections
- Check footnotes and caveats

**Risk Level:** LOW (already acknowledged)

**Example:**
> "This business case assumes 15% year-over-year growth."

### 5.2 IMPLICIT Assumptions

**Definition:** Required for conclusions but not stated; inferred from reasoning.

**Characteristics:**
- Hidden in the logical chain
- Author may not realize they exist
- Often "obvious" to insiders

**Detection Heuristics:**
- Inversion: "What must be true for this to work?"
- Five Whys: Drill into reasoning
- Outsider test: "What would a newcomer question?"

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (can be surfaced with effort)

**Example:**
> Document says "Users will migrate to new system"
> Implicit: Users have time/motivation to learn new system
> Implicit: New system is better enough to justify switching cost

### 5.3 STRUCTURAL Assumptions

**Definition:** Embedded in how the problem is framed; invisible to those inside the frame.

**Characteristics:**
- Shape what questions get asked
- Define what's in/out of scope
- Often only visible in hindsight

**Detection Heuristics:**
- Frame questioning: "Why this frame, not another?"
- Missing voices: "Who isn't represented?"
- Scope boundary probe: "Why is X out of scope?"

**Risk Level:** HIGH (often invisible until too late)

**Example:**
> Problem framed as "How do we improve our mobile app?"
> Structural assumption: Mobile app is the right solution
> Missed: Maybe users want a different channel entirely

### 5.4 LOAD-BEARING Assumptions

**Definition:** Assumptions where failure causes the entire plan/decision to collapse.

**Characteristics:**
- Everything depends on them
- Often single points of failure
- May be any of the other types

**Detection Heuristics:**
- Dependency mapping: Trace what relies on what
- Pre-mortem: "What caused total failure?"
- Inversion: "Without X, does anything work?"

**Risk Level:** CRITICAL (single point of failure)

**Example:**
> Strategy depends on "Competitor won't react for 18 months"
> If wrong: Entire competitive positioning collapses

### 5.5 CONTEXTUAL Assumptions

**Definition:** Assumptions about the environment, market, or conditions.

**Characteristics:**
- External to the organization
- Often based on current state
- May change without warning

**Detection Heuristics:**
- Environmental scan: Market, regulatory, technology
- Time decay test: "Will this hold in 1/3/5 years?"
- External dependency check

**Risk Level:** VARIABLE (depends on volatility)

**Example:**
> "Interest rates will remain below 5%"
> "No new regulations in this space"
> "Technology X will become standard"

### 5.6 BEHAVIORAL Assumptions

**Definition:** Assumptions about how people, teams, or systems will act.

**Characteristics:**
- Human/organizational behavior
- Often optimistic
- Frequently wrong

**Detection Heuristics:**
- Stakeholder modeling: "Will they actually do X?"
- Incentive analysis: "Why would they?"
- Historical behavior: "Have they done this before?"

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH (humans are unpredictable)

**Example:**
> "Engineering team will adopt new practices"
> "Customers will understand the value proposition"
> "Partners will share data as promised"

Priority = (Dependency × (1 - Confidence)) / Validation Cost
```

**Interpretation:**
- Priority > 3.0: CRITICAL - Validate immediately
- Priority 2.0-3.0: HIGH - Validate before decision
- Priority 1.0-2.0: MEDIUM - Validate if time permits
- Priority < 1.0: LOW - Document and accept

**See:** `references/load-bearing-analysis.md` for complete framework.

## 11. Workflow Integration

### Upstream Skills

| Skill | Provides | Use Case |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `research-interviewer` | KNOWLEDGE-CORPUS | When subject knowledge needs elicitation first |
| `expert-panel-deliberation` | Multi-perspective input | When diverse expert views inform assumptions |
| `create-research-brief` | Research synthesis | When external research informs assumptions |

### Downstream Skills

| Skill | Receives | Use Case |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `expert-panel-deliberation` | RISK-ASSESSMENT | For panel review of identified risks |
| `generate-ideas` | Assumption gaps | To generate alternatives when assumptions fail |

### Skill Chaining Example

```
research-interviewer      → KNOWLEDGE-CORPUS
                               ↓
assumption-validator      → RISK-ASSESSMENT
                               ↓
expert-panel-deliberation → Validated risk mitigation plan
```

## 12. Behavioral Guidelines

### Approach Principles

- **Curious, not adversarial:** Surface assumptions to understand, not to attack
- **Humble about certainty:** Calibrate confidence honestly; overconfidence is dangerous
- **Specific, not vague:** Each assumption should be falsifiable
- **Proportionate effort:** Match validation depth to decision stakes
- **Actionable output:** Every finding should inform a decision or action
- **Transparent reasoning:** Show how assumptions connect to risks
- **Constructive framing:** Present findings to enable better decisions, not to criticize

### Tone Calibration by Intensity

| Intensity | Tone |
|-----------|------|
| **Light** | Collaborative sanity check; quick scan for obvious gaps |
| **Standard** | Thorough review; balanced coverage of key assumptions |
| **Rigorous** | Adversarial stress-test; leave no stone unturned |

### Communication Guidelines

- State assumptions as falsifiable propositions, not vague concerns
- Distinguish between "unvalidated" (unknown) and "invalidated" (known false)
- When confidence is low, say so explicitly
- Provide evidence for validation claims
- Recommend specific actions, not just flag risks
