# Compare Options

Multi-expert comparison and ranking of options using structured deliberation.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Compare multiple alternatives systematically
- Evaluate trade-offs between options
- Get diverse expert perspectives on a decision
- Rank options with transparent criteria
- Make decisions with documented rationale

## Workflow

Invoke the `expert-panel-deliberation` skill for:

Options to compare: $ARGUMENTS

### Default Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| `panel_size` | 5 | Diverse perspectives without analysis paralysis |
| `output_format` | ranking | Produces prioritized list with scores |
| `deliberation_depth` | standard | Balanced thoroughness |
| `include_challenger` | true | Include devil's advocate perspective |
| `consensus_required` | false | Allow minority opinions |

### Expert Panel Assembly

The panel is dynamically composed based on the decision domain:

**For Technical Decisions:**
- Solution Architect
- Performance Specialist
- Security Expert
- DevOps/Operations
- End User Advocate

**For Business Decisions:**
- Strategic Planner
- Financial Analyst
- Market Expert
- Operations Lead
- Customer Representative

**For Product Decisions:**
- Product Strategist
- UX Designer
- Engineering Lead
- Business Analyst
- Customer Advocate

### Deliberation Process

#### Round 1: Independent Assessment
Each expert evaluates all options against criteria:
- Scores each option (1-10) on their specialty dimensions
- Documents key strengths and weaknesses
- Identifies critical risks or blockers

#### Round 2: Cross-Examination
Experts challenge each other's assessments:
- Surface hidden assumptions
- Probe trade-off implications
- Identify overlooked factors

#### Round 3: Synthesis
Panel converges on:
- Weighted ranking of options
- Key trade-offs documented
- Recommended choice with rationale
- Conditions under which ranking changes

### Evaluation Criteria Framework

Standard criteria (customized to domain):

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Effectiveness | 25% | How well does it solve the core problem? |
| Cost/Effort | 20% | Total cost of ownership, implementation effort |
| Risk | 20% | What can go wrong? Likelihood and impact |
| Scalability | 15% | Does it grow with needs? |
| Reversibility | 10% | Can we change course if needed? |
| Time to Value | 10% | How quickly do we see benefits? |

## Output Format
