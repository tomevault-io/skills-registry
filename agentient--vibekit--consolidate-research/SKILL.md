# Consolidate Research

Synthesize research outputs from multiple sources into a unified, confidence-tiered, pattern-aware report with provenance tracking and quality metrics. Works standalone or manifest-driven from `create-research-brief`.

**Shared references**: `consolidation-manifest-schema.md` (schema), `pattern-registry.md` (patterns + defaults)

## Workflow Overview

```
1. RECEIVE INPUTS ─── Manifest detection, source identification
2. NORMALIZE INPUTS ── Model-specific extraction → common claim format
3. TRIAGE CLAIMS ───── Atomic decomposition, dependency graphs, provenance
4. RECONCILE ───────── Provenance-weighted disagreement, citation dedup
5. SYNTHESIZE ──────── Cross-domain synthesis, structural artifact merging
6. GENERATE OUTPUT ─── Pattern-specific template, quality metrics, freshness
7. SELF-REVIEW ─────── 7 mandatory checks before finalizing
```

---

## Step 1: Receive & Validate Inputs

### Manifest Detection

```
Input contains YAML block with `consolidation_manifest:` label?
│
├─ YES (manifest-driven)
│   ├─ Parse manifest fields: research_id, pattern, models, coverage_matrix
│   ├─ Extract consolidation config: mode, verification_priorities
│   ├─ Load pattern-specific output template from Pattern Registry
│   ├─ Note research chain context (upstream_id, inherited_constraints)
│   └─ Use model identifiers from manifest — do NOT guess sources
│
└─ NO (standalone mode)
    ├─ Ask for or infer: topic, sources, consolidation mode
    ├─ Derive pattern from content using Pattern Registry decision tree
    ├─ Use pattern defaults from Quick Reference table
    └─ Confirm inferred pattern + mode with user before proceeding
```

### Source Identification Heuristics

When manifest is absent and source is unlabeled, apply capability-aware signals:

| Signal | Likely Source | Strength |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Deep reasoning chains, cross-domain analogies, self-corrections, hedged nuance | Claude Opus 4.6 | primary_researcher |
| Structured tables with dense citations, systematic catalogs, source appendix | Gemini 3.1 Pro Deep Research | structured_cataloger |
| Site-specific citations, temporal progression ("as of [date]"), intervention markers | GPT-5.2 Deep Research | targeted_investigator |
| Quick facts, recent dates, sentiment language, short-form responses | GPT-5.2 Chat | recency_validator |
| Proprietary data, specific methodologies, organizational context | Human analyst | domain_expert |

If uncertain after heuristic check, ask user to confirm. When manifest is present, always use `manifest.models[].model_id`.

### Validation

```
Research outputs provided?
├─ NO → Ask: "Please share the research outputs to consolidate."
└─ YES → Sources identifiable?
         ├─ NO → Ask: "Which source produced each output?"
         └─ YES → ≥2 sources?
                  ├─ NO → Warn: single-source consolidation has limited value.
                  │        Offer: proceed as structured review, or add sources.
                  └─ YES → Proceed to Step 2.
```

---

## Step 2: Normalize Inputs

Convert heterogeneous model outputs into a common claim format before triaging.

### Extraction Patterns by Source

| Source | Extract | Tag |
|--------|---------|-----|
| **Claude Opus 4.6** | Reasoning chains (analytical steps, not just conclusions) | `type: reasoning_chain` |
| | Conclusions linked to their supporting chains | `type: factual/causal` |
| | Web search findings with source URLs | `channel: web_search` |
| | Cross-domain insights and analogies | `type: cross_domain_synthesis` |
| | Self-review corrections (higher-confidence refinements) | `type: factual` |
| **Gemini 3.1 Pro** | Tables — preserve structure, do not flatten | `type: structural_artifact` |
| | Prose claims with inline citation mapping | `type: factual/causal` |
| | Source appendix — map citations to claims, compute quality scores | provenance metadata |
| | Comparison matrices with per-cell provenance | `type: structural_artifact` |
| | file_search-grounded claims | `channel: internal_document` |
| **GPT-5.2 Deep** | Assertions with temporal markers ("as of [date]") | `provenance.temporal_marker` |
| | Site-specific findings with source domain | `channel: site_restricted` |
| | Intervention-adjusted findings (higher targeted confidence) | boosted weight |
| | Timeline/progression narratives | `type: structural_artifact` |
| **GPT-5.2 Chat** | Quick facts with recency dates | `channel: quick_validation` |
| | Sentiment signals | `type: recommendation` |
| | *All Chat claims default to lower provenance weight* | validation role |

### Normalized Claim Format

```yaml
claim: {id: "C-{seq}", text: "...", type: factual|causal|quantitative|recommendation|unique|reasoning_chain|structural_artifact,
  source_model: claude-opus-4-6|gemini-3.1-pro|gpt-5.2-deep|gpt-5.2-chat|human,
  provenance: {channel: web_search|file_search|site_restricted|quick_validation|internal_document,
    site_restrictions: [], context_documents: [], citation_quality: 0-5, temporal_marker: "YYYY-MM-DD"|null},
  depends_on: [claim IDs]}
```

### Citation Quality Scale

| Score | Source Type | Examples |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 5 | Primary | SEC filings, peer-reviewed, official stats, vendor docs |
| 4 | High-quality secondary | Gartner, Forrester, named-source journalism |
| 3 | General secondary | News, press releases, industry publications |
| 2 | Tertiary | Wikipedia, blogs, aggregators |
| 1 | Unsourced assertion | No citation trail |
| 0 | Unverifiable | Contradicts known facts or cites non-existent sources |

---

## Step 3: Triage Claims

Decompose normalized claims into an atomic claims matrix with dependency tracking.

### Claim Types

| Type | Handling |
|------|----------|
| **Factual assertions** | Cross-validate; trace to primary sources |
| **Causal claims** | Map reasoning chains; note mechanism divergence |
| **Quantitative data** | Flag discrepancies >10%; verify primary source agreement |
| **Recommendations** | Tag as interpretation; link to supporting facts |
| **Unique insights** | Preserve with provenance flag; do not discard |
| **Reasoning chains** | Preserve structure; validate logical steps; compare across sources |
| **Structural artifacts** | Preserve format (tables, matrices, timelines); merge in Step 5 |

### Claims Matrix

Rows = claims, columns = sources. `(qN)` = citation quality. Flag same-primary-source convergence separately.

```
             │ Claude │ Gemini │ GPT-5.2D│ GPT-5.2C│ Status
─────────────┼────────┼────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
Claim A      │ ✓ (q4) │ ✓ (q5) │  ✓ (q3) │         │ Convergent (diff sources)
Claim B      │ ✓ (q4) │ ✓ (q4) │         │         │ Convergent (same primary?)
Claim C      │ ✓ (q3) │        │         │         │ Unique
Claim D      │ ✓ (q4) │ differ │  differ │         │ Contested
```

### Claim Dependency Graphs

`Claim A (factual) ──supports──► Claim B (causal) ──supports──► Claim C (recommendation)`

**Rules**: Recommendation confidence CANNOT exceed supporting facts. If a fact drops tiers, propagate to ALL dependents. Document chains in output.

---

## Step 4: Reconcile

### Provenance-Weighted Disagreement Protocol

Execute in order — stop at first resolution:

| Step | Test | Resolution |
|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | **Coexist?** Different scope/timeframe/definition? | Preserve both with clarifying context |
| 2 | **Provenance?** Higher channel? (`site_restricted` > `web_search` > `quick_validation`; `internal_document` > `web_search` for proprietary) | Favor higher provenance; note alternative |
| 3 | **Citation dedup?** Same primary source(s)? | Treat as SINGLE-SOURCE (Tier 2 cap), not independent |
| 4 | **Specificity?** One more specific or better sourced? | Favor specificity; note alternative |
| 5 | **Majority?** Most sources agree? | Lead with majority; preserve dissent |
| 6 | **All diverge** | Flag "unresolved." Agentic mode: web search. Else: present all views |

### Confidence Tier Assignment

| Tier | Threshold | Criteria |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **1** (High) | >75% | Cross-model from DIFFERENT primaries + avg quality ≥4 + falsifiable |
| **2** (Moderate) | 50-75% | Same-primary cross-model (cap) OR single quality ≥4 OR majority w/ avg 3 |
| **3** (Low) | <50% | Single-source quality <4 OR contested OR unsourced |

Key rule: Same-primary-source agreement caps at Tier 2 — prevents "3 models citing same blog" inflation.

### Dependency Propagation

After reconciling individual claims: (1) Walk dependency graph root-to-leaf. (2) Supporting claim dropped → dependent drops too (floor: Tier 3). (3) Recommendations on Tier 3 facts → flag: "requires independent verification." (4) Document all propagation in Methodology Notes.

### False Confidence Audit

Apply to all Tier 1 candidates (mandatory in Adversarial mode):

| Check | Question |
|-------|---------|
| Citation diversity | Different primary sources, or all citing same 2-3? |
| Specificity test | Falsifiable claim, or vague enough to be unfalsifiable? |
| Recency check | Could this have changed? Source publication dates? |
| Contrarian search | Credible dissent? What would skeptics say? |
| Mechanism check | Same mechanism = shared bias risk. Different mechanisms converging = higher confidence. |

If concerns → downgrade to Tier 2 with explicit note.

---

## Step 5: Synthesize

Transforms reconciled claims into integrated insights. Mandatory — not optional.

### Cross-Domain Synthesis Pass (4 Required Prompts)

| # | Prompt | Seeks |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | "Which findings, when combined, imply something neither source stated?" | Emergent insights |
| 2 | "Which constraints interact with findings from another domain?" | Constraint interactions |
| 3 | "Which consensus views look different through an unrelated domain's lens?" | Frame-breaking |
| 4 | "What would need to be true for the consensus to be wrong?" | Contrarian check |

Tag all outputs `claim_type: cross_domain_synthesis`. Document pass execution even if yield is zero.

### Structural Artifact Merging

| Artifact | Merge Strategy |
|----------|---------------|
| Tables | Union rows/columns; per-cell provenance; highlight conflicts |
| Timelines | Interleave chronologically; flag disputed dates with both versions |
| Decision trees | Merge branches; note divergent recommendations at same decision point |
| Matrices | Union dimensions; per-cell provenance; highlight scoring disagreements |

---

## Step 6: Generate Output

### Template Selection

Manifest present with pattern → use directly. No manifest → infer from content via Pattern Registry decision tree; confirm with user.

### Universal Sections (All Patterns)

| # | Section | Content |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | Executive Summary | 2-3 paragraphs: key findings, implications, overall confidence |
| 2 | Tier 1 Findings | High-confidence claims: claim + support + implication |
| 3 | Tier 2 Findings | Moderate-confidence: claim + support + caveat |
| 4 | Contested Areas | Per-source views + assessment + resolution path |
| 5 | Coverage Gaps | Expected vs actual coverage table with recommended actions |
| 6 | Unique Insights | Per-source single-source findings with provenance |
| 7 | Cross-Domain Synthesis | Emergent insights, constraint interactions, frame-breaking observations |
| 8 | For Downstream | Pattern-specific actionable outputs |
| 9 | Quality Metrics | Computed metrics block |
| 10 | Freshness Model | Staleness detection + refresh recommendations |
| 11 | Methodology Notes | Mode, sources, conflicts resolved, chain context, limitations |
| 12 | Self-Review Results | 7-check outcomes summary |

### Pattern-Specific Sections

In addition to universal sections, each pattern adds:

| Pattern | Additional Sections |
|---------|-------------------|
| `landscape_mapping` | Taxonomy + Player Inventory per category, White Space Map |
| `comparative_evaluation` | Weighted Decision Matrix (options x criteria), Sensitivity Analysis, Recommendation with flip conditions |
| `implementation_pattern` | Architecture Decision Catalog, Pattern Catalog by phase, Anti-Pattern Register |
| `best_practices` | 8-Dimension Knowledge Base sections, Quick Reference Card |
| `competitive_intelligence` | Per-Competitor Strategic Profile, Competitive Dynamics Analysis |
| `market_research` | TAM/SAM/SOM with ranges, Segmentation Framework, Demand Drivers/Inhibitors |
| `user_research` | Persona Cards, JTBD Map (functional/emotional/social), Unmet Needs Hierarchy |
| `economic_analysis` | Financial Model (cost + value + ROI), Sensitivity Table, Benchmark Comparison |
| `compliance_requirements` | Requirements Register, Constraint Map, Governance Recommendations |

### "For Downstream" Actionability

| Pattern | Downstream Content | Primary Target |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| `landscape_mapping` | Shortlist criteria + recommended evaluation set | `comparative_evaluation` |
| `comparative_evaluation` | Decision recommendation + selection rationale + ADR draft | Foundry / `implementation_pattern` |
| `implementation_pattern` | Architecture decision log + implementation checklist | Foundry (requirements) |
| `best_practices` | Skill-ready KB structure + Quick Reference Card | Claude Code skills |
| `competitive_intelligence` | Positioning strategy + differentiation matrix | Ignite (GTM) |
| `market_research` | Segment prioritization + entry strategy recommendation | Spark (ideation) |
| `user_research` | Persona cards + JTBD map + ranked unmet needs | Foundry + Spark |
| `economic_analysis` | Financial model summary + key assumptions + sensitivity ranges | Vantage |
| `compliance_requirements` | Requirements register + constraint map | Foundry |

### Quality Metrics

Compute and include in every output:

| Metric | Formula | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `coverage_ratio` | claims addressed / total claims | Input coverage completeness |
| `conflict_resolution_rate` | resolved / identified | Disagreement handling |
| `provenance_depth` | % Tier 1 with multi-source from DIFFERENT primaries | Independent corroboration |
| `actionability_score` | % findings with downstream action | Output usefulness |
| `staleness_risk` | % claims with sources older than volatility threshold | Temporal reliability |
| `dependency_chain_integrity` | % recommendations with validated chains | Logical soundness |
| `cross_domain_synthesis_yield` | count of cross-domain insights | Synthesis value-add |

### Freshness Model

```yaml
freshness_model:
  research_id: "{from manifest or generated}"
  research_pattern: "{pattern_id}"
  topic_volatility: high|medium|low   # from Pattern Registry
  estimated_half_life: 3_months|6_months|12_months
  recommended_refresh: "YYYY-MM-DD"   # execution date + half-life
  staleness_indicators: ["signal 1", "signal 2", "signal 3"]  # 3-5 observable triggers
  source_dates: {oldest: "YYYY-MM-DD", newest: "YYYY-MM-DD"}
```

---

## Step 7: Self-Review (Mandatory)

Execute ALL checks before finalizing. Report results in the Self-Review Results section.

| # | Check | Procedure | If Failed |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Contradiction scan** | Do claims in one section contradict another? | Reconcile or flag explicitly. |
| 2 | **Confidence tier audit** | Did any claim's tier shift during writing? | Update tier + propagate dependencies. |
| 3 | **Dependency chain validation** | Are all recommendation → fact chains consistent? | Flag broken chains; downgrade recommendations. |
| 4 | **Coverage check** | Compare actual coverage vs. manifest coverage_matrix (or inferred). | Document gaps in Coverage Gaps section. |
| 5 | **Cross-domain synthesis check** | Was the mandatory synthesis pass executed? Insights generated? | If skipped, execute now. If zero yield, document. |
| 6 | **Quality metrics validation** | Are metrics internally consistent? (e.g., denominator matches actual count) | Recompute. |
| 7 | **Freshness check** | Any source dates older than topic volatility threshold? | Flag in staleness_risk metric + Freshness Model. |

---

## Consolidation Modes (7)

### Mode Quick Reference

| Mode | Best For | Leads With | Key Differentiator |
|------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Standard** | General synthesis | Convergent findings | Balanced tiering |
| **Adversarial** | High-stakes decisions | Stress-tested claims | False confidence audit on ALL Tier 1 |
| **Gap-Driven** | Coverage completeness | Missing areas | Coverage matrix as primary frame |
| **Confidence-Weighted** | Executive / financial decisions | Evidence quality | Citation quality drives tiers |
| **Depth-First** | Strategic / analytical topics | Deepest reasoning | Reasoning chains featured |
| **Breadth-First** | Landscape / domain mapping | Comprehensive coverage | Completeness over depth |
| **Agentic** | Minimal-intervention consolidation | Full autonomous pipeline | Web search for gap-filling + verification |

### Mode Selection Logic

Priority: (1) User explicit > (2) Manifest recommended_mode > (3) Infer from context > (4) Pattern default.

**Context inference signals**: "high stakes"/"executive" → confidence_weighted | "due diligence"/"comprehensive" → gap_driven | suspiciously aligned outputs → adversarial | "quick synthesis" → standard | strategic/nuanced → depth_first | new domain/landscape → breadth_first | "agentic"/"hands-off" → agentic.

When inferred, confirm: "I'll use **[Mode]** based on [reasoning]. This will [brief description]. Proceed?"

### Pattern x Mode Defaults

| Pattern | Default Mode | Override Trigger |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| `landscape_mapping` | breadth_first | "deep-dive on key players" → depth_first |
| `comparative_evaluation` | confidence_weighted | "quick comparison" → standard |
| `implementation_pattern` | depth_first | "comprehensive catalog" → breadth_first |
| `best_practices` | gap_driven | "focus on anti-patterns only" → depth_first |
| `competitive_intelligence` | adversarial | "just the facts" → standard |
| `market_research` | standard | "high-stakes investment" → confidence_weighted |
| `user_research` | depth_first | "broad needs survey" → breadth_first |
| `economic_analysis` | confidence_weighted | "rough estimate" → standard |
| `compliance_requirements` | gap_driven | "highest-risk areas" → depth_first |

### Mode Procedures

**Standard**: (1) Identify convergent claims. (2) Flag divergent for reconciliation. (3) Apply disagreement protocol. (4) Tier by confidence (same-primary-source caps at Tier 2).

**Adversarial**: (1) Flag suspicious alignment on contested topics. (2) False Confidence Audit on ALL Tier 1. (3) Identify cross-source critique points. (4) Stress test: what falsifies aligned claims? (5) Downgrade where audit reveals concerns.

**Gap-Driven**: (1) Derive expected coverage from manifest or pattern template. (2) Audit actual vs expected. (3) Document total gaps (no coverage) + partial gaps (single-source). (4) Prioritize by downstream impact.

**Confidence-Weighted**: (1) Citation Quality Scale on every claim. (2) Per-claim confidence = `(sum scores) / (max possible)`. (3) Weight by quality, not source count. (4) Single quality-5 > three quality-1.

**Depth-First**: (1) Find deepest source (usually Claude/human). (2) Lead with reasoning chains. (3) Validate key chain claims via other sources. (4) Fill breadth gaps from cataloger (Gemini). (5) Feature strategic insights prominently.

**Breadth-First**: (1) Find most comprehensive source (usually Gemini). (2) Lead with coverage completeness. (3) Add depth on high-importance areas. (4) Update with recency from GPT-5.2. (5) Completeness is primary metric.

**Agentic**: Autonomous end-to-end with minimal user intervention. (1) Ingest all + manifest. (2) Execute Steps 2-5 autonomously. (3) Web search to resolve conflicts. (4) Targeted searches for coverage gaps. (5) Draft with cross-domain synthesis. (6) Full self-review with web verification. (7) Compute metrics; revise if needed. (8) Final output. Requires: `claude-opus-4-6`, `thinking: adaptive`, `effort: max`. Use when: all models done, topic bounded, manifest present, user wants hands-off.

---

## Research Chain Protocol

When `manifest.research_chain.upstream_id` is set: (1) Request upstream consolidated output if not provided. (2) Validate downstream vs upstream consistency. (3) Flag contradictions. (4) Propagate inherited_constraints. (5) Apply chain validations (below). (6) Note in Methodology: "Part of chain: [upstream] → [this]". If no upstream → standard consolidation.

### Chain-Specific Validations

| Chain Link | Validation |
|-----------|-----------|
| Landscape → Comparative | Do all evaluated options appear in upstream landscape? Flag new ones. |
| Comparative → Implementation | Does selected option match upstream recommendation? If different, document why. |
| Market → Landscape | Are market segments consistent with landscape scope? Flag scope drift. |
| Market → Competitive | Are market structure assumptions consistent? Flag divergence. |
| Compliance → Implementation | Do all patterns satisfy upstream constraint map? Flag violations. |
| User Research → Comparative | Do evaluation criteria map to identified user needs? Flag orphan criteria. |

### Constraint Propagation Rules

Upstream constraints are HARD by default — cannot contradict without explicit justification. If downstream evidence challenges an upstream constraint, flag as "constraint tension" (do not silently override). Document all propagated constraints in Methodology Notes.

---

## Integration Notes

**Manifest-driven** (after create-research-brief): Manifest provides ALL config — skip derivation. Pattern template pre-selected. Coverage matrix enables precise gap detection. Chain context available. Model capabilities known — provenance tagging is precise. Verification priorities pre-identified.

**Standalone**: Derive config from content + user input. User may paste a manifest manually. Pattern detection via Registry decision tree. Source ID via heuristic table. Coverage from pattern defaults. Works with any source types.
