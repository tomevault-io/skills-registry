# React Native Development Patterns

> **Quick Guide:** Build cross-platform mobile apps with React Native's New Architecture (default since 0.76). Use FlashList for performant lists (or FlatList with proper optimization). Use type-safe navigation hooks with static or dynamic API. Keep components small, memoize callbacks passed to lists, and test on both platforms from day one.

## CRITICAL: Before Using This Skill

> **All code must follow project conventions in CLAUDE.md** (kebab-case, named exports, import ordering, `import type`, named constants)

**(You MUST use FlashList (preferred) or FlatList for lists with more than 20 items - NEVER ScrollView with .map() for long lists)**

**(You MUST memoize renderItem callbacks and use stable keyExtractor functions - avoid key props on FlashList items as it breaks recycling)**

**(You MUST use react-native-safe-area-context for safe areas - React Native's built-in SafeAreaView is deprecated in 0.81+ and will be removed)**

**(You MUST test on BOTH iOS AND Android from day one - platform differences cause bugs)**

**(You MUST use Platform.select() or platform-specific files for platform differences - shadows, fonts, and feedback differ)**

**(You MUST be aware the New Architecture is enabled by default since React Native 0.76 - Fabric, TurboModules, and bridgeless mode)**

<philosophy>

## Philosophy

React Native enables building native mobile apps using React patterns. The key insight is that **mobile has different constraints than web**: performance matters more, platform conventions differ, and users expect native feel.

**Core principles:**

1. **New Architecture first** - React Native 0.76+ uses the New Architecture by default (Fabric, TurboModules, JSI, bridgeless mode)
2. **Platform-first thinking** - iOS and Android have different UX conventions (haptics, ripples, navigation patterns)
3. **Performance by default** - Mobile devices are constrained; use FlashList/FlatList, memoize callbacks, avoid inline styles
4. **Native feel matters** - Use native components, proper keyboard handling, safe area insets
5. **Type safety prevents bugs** - Type navigation params, props, and native module interfaces
6. **Test both platforms early** - Platform bugs compound over time; test daily on both

**New Architecture (React Native 0.76+):**

The New Architecture removes the legacy bridge and provides:

- **Fabric** - Modern rendering engine with synchronous layout effects
- **TurboModules** - Lazy-loaded native modules with type-safe interfaces
- **JSI (JavaScript Interface)** - Direct synchronous JS-to-native calls without serialization
- **Bridgeless Mode** - Complete removal of the async bridge for better performance

Performance improvements with New Architecture: ~15ms faster app startup (~8% improvement), ~3.8MB smaller app size (20% reduction), ~15x faster Metro resolver, ~4x faster warm builds.

**Mental model:**

React Native is NOT "write once, run anywhere" - it's "learn once, write anywhere." Expect to write some platform-specific code. The shared codebase is typically 80-95%, not 100%.

</philosophy>

<patterns>

## Core Patterns

### Pattern 1: Component Architecture

Build components with TypeScript, accessibility props, and platform awareness. Key concerns: use `Pressable` over `TouchableOpacity`, include `accessibilityRole`/`accessibilityState`, use `testID` for E2E tests, and memoize styles with `useMemo`.

```typescript
// Key pattern: accessibility + testID + memoized styles
<Pressable
  ref={ref}
  style={buttonStyle}
  onPress={handlePress}
  disabled={disabled}
  testID={testID}
  accessibilityRole="button"
  accessibilityState={{ disabled }}
>
  <Text style={styles.text}>{children}</Text>
</Pressable>
```

**Why good:** accessibilityRole/State for screen readers, testID for E2E, Pressable supports android_ripple unlike TouchableOpacity

See [examples/core.md](examples/core.md) for full component with forwardRef, variants, and loading state.

---

### Pattern 2: Safe Area and Keyboard Handling

Handle device notches, status bars, and keyboard properly. Use `react-native-safe-area-context` (RN's built-in SafeAreaView is deprecated in 0.81+).

```typescript
import { SafeAreaView, useSafeAreaInsets } from "react-native-safe-area-context";

// Screen wrapper with safe areas
<SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }} edges={["top", "bottom"]}>
  {children}
</SafeAreaView>

// Keyboard handling for forms
<KeyboardAvoidingView
  style={{ flex: 1 }}
  behavior={Platform.OS === "ios" ? "padding" : "height"}
  keyboardVerticalOffset={Platform.select({ ios: HEADER_HEIGHT, android: 0 })}
>
  <ScrollView keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled">
    <FormContent />
  </ScrollView>
</KeyboardAvoidingView>
```

**Why good:** SafeAreaView handles notches/Dynamic Island, KeyboardAvoidingView prevents keyboard overlap, Platform.select handles iOS/Android differences

---

### Pattern 3: Platform-Specific Code

Handle iOS and Android differences with `Platform.select` for small differences, separate files (`.ios.tsx`/`.android.tsx`) for significant divergence.

```typescript
// Platform.select for shadows (iOS shadow props ignored on Android)
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  card: {
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: {
        shadowColor: "#000",
        shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
        shadowOpacity: 0.1,
        shadowRadius: 4,
      },
      android: { elevation: 4 },
    }),
  },
  text: {
    fontWeight: Platform.select({ ios: "600", android: "bold" }),
  },
});
```

**Why good:** iOS shadow props are completely ignored on Android, fontWeight 100-900 unreliable on Android

For platform-specific file splitting with haptics, see [examples/core.md](examples/core.md).

---

### Pattern 4: FlashList and FlatList Optimization

Use FlashList for performant lists (cell recycling, 50% less blank area). FlashList v2 is New Architecture only. Always memoize renderItem and keyExtractor. Never add `key` props to FlashList items (breaks recycling).

```typescript
// Critical: memoized renderItem + no key prop on items
const renderItem = useCallback(
  ({ item }: { item: Product }) => (
    <ProductItem item={item} onPress={onProductPress} />
  ),
  [onProductPress]
);

<FlashList
  data={products}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  estimatedItemSize={ITEM_HEIGHT} // Optional in v2, required in v1
  getItemType={(item) => item.category} // Improves recycling pool
/>
```

**Why good:** useCallback prevents renderItem recreation, getItemType optimizes recycling, no key prop preserves FlashList's main benefit

See [examples/performance.md](examples/performance.md) for full FlashList and FlatList optimization patterns.

---

### Pattern 5: React 19 Features (React Native 0.78+)

React Native 0.78+ includes React 19 with new hooks and simplified patterns.

```typescript
import { useOptimistic } from "react";

// useOptimistic - optimistic UI updates with automatic rollback
const [optimisticMessages, addOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic(
  messages,
  (state, newMessage: Message) => [...state, { ...newMessage, sending: true }]
);

// ref as props - no more forwardRef wrapper needed (React 19)
function Input({ ref, placeholder, onChangeText }: InputProps) {
  return <TextInput ref={ref} placeholder={placeholder} onChangeText={onChangeText} />;
}
```

**Why good:** useOptimistic provides automatic rollback on errors, ref as props eliminates forwardRef boilerplate

</patterns>

<red_flags>

## RED FLAGS

**High Priority Issues:**

- Using ScrollView + map() for lists with 50+ items - causes severe performance, use FlashList or FlatList
- Adding key prop to FlashList items - BREAKS cell recycling, eliminates FlashList's main benefit
- Using React Native's built-in SafeAreaView - deprecated in 0.81+, use react-native-safe-area-context
- Not testing on both platforms - iOS/Android differences compound; test daily on both
- Inline functions in FlatList/FlashList renderItem - creates new function every render, breaks memoization
- Using Reanimated 4 with old architecture - Reanimated 4.x is New Architecture ONLY

**Medium Priority Issues:**

- Hardcoded colors/spacing instead of constants - breaks consistency, makes theming impossible
- Not using Platform.select for shadows - iOS shadow props don't work on Android (use elevation)
- Missing keyboard handling on forms - keyboard covers inputs without KeyboardAvoidingView
- Using TouchableOpacity everywhere - Pressable is more flexible and supports android_ripple

**Gotchas & Edge Cases:**

- Android fontWeight only supports 'normal' and 'bold' reliably - 100-900 values may not work
- iOS shadow props are completely ignored on Android - must use elevation for Android shadows
- StatusBar backgroundColor only works on Android - iOS uses translucent status bar
- FlatList onEndReached fires immediately if data fits screen - use onEndReachedThreshold carefully
- KeyboardAvoidingView behavior differs: 'padding' for iOS, 'height' for Android
- React Native doesn't have CSS cascade - each component must have complete styles
- Text must be wrapped in `<Text>` component - raw strings cause crashes
- New Architecture enabled by default in 0.76+ - some older libraries may need updates
- FlashList v2 is New Architecture only - use v1 or FlatList if on old architecture
- React Native 0.78+ uses React 19 - propTypes removed, forwardRef optional
- React 19 adoption in recent SDK versions - check for breaking changes in your dependencies
- Android 15/16 enforces edge-to-edge - must handle safe areas properly
- Reanimated 4 requires react-native-worklets - Reanimated 3 will not work with it installed
- boxShadow and filter props are New Architecture only - not available on legacy architecture
- Reanimated 4: withSpring no longer uses restDisplacementThreshold/restSpeedThreshold - replaced by energyThreshold
