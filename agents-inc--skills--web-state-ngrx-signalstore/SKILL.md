# NgRx SignalStore Patterns

> **Quick Guide:** Use NgRx SignalStore for reactive client state in Angular 17+. Compose stores with `withState`, `withComputed`, `withMethods`. Use `patchState` for immutable updates. Use `withEntities` for collections. NEVER use traditional NgRx patterns (actions, reducers, effects) in new SignalStore code.

## CRITICAL: Before Managing State with NgRx SignalStore

**(You MUST use `patchState()` for ALL state updates - NEVER mutate state directly)**

**(You MUST wrap async operations in `rxMethod()` from `@ngrx/signals/rxjs-interop` for RxJS integration)**

**(You MUST use `withEntities()` from `@ngrx/signals/entities` for entity collections - NOT arrays in state)**

**(You MUST use named exports ONLY - NO default exports in any store files)**

**(You MUST use named constants for ALL numbers - NO magic numbers in state code)**

</critical_requirements>

**Auto-detection:** NgRx SignalStore, signalStore, withState, withComputed, withMethods, patchState, withEntities, rxMethod, signalStoreFeature, @ngrx/signals

**When to use:**

- Managing reactive client state in Angular 17+ applications
- Building composable, reusable store features
- Handling entity collections with CRUD operations
- Integrating RxJS operators for side effects
- Applications requiring fine-grained reactivity with Angular Signals

**Key patterns covered:**

- Store creation with `signalStore()` and `providedIn` options
- State, computed, and methods composition
- Entity management with `withEntities`
- RxJS integration with `rxMethod` and signal-only `signalMethod`
- Custom features with `signalStoreFeature` and context-aware `withFeature` (v20+)
- Derived reactive state with `withLinkedState` (v20+)
- Call state patterns (loading, loaded, error)

**When NOT to use:**

- Server/API data as primary source (use HTTP services with rxMethod for caching)
- Simple component-local state (use Angular signals directly)
- Projects still on Angular < 17 (requires signals)
- Teams unfamiliar with functional composition patterns

<philosophy>

## Philosophy

NgRx SignalStore is a lightweight, functional state management solution built on Angular Signals. It replaces traditional NgRx patterns (actions, reducers, effects, selectors) with a composable, feature-based approach that eliminates boilerplate while maintaining predictability.

**Core Principles:**

1. **Functional Composition** - Build stores by composing features like `withState`, `withComputed`, `withMethods`
2. **Signal-Based Reactivity** - Leverage Angular's fine-grained reactivity for optimal performance
3. **Immutable Updates** - Use `patchState()` for predictable state transitions
4. **Extensibility** - Create custom features with `signalStoreFeature()` for reuse across stores

**Key Architecture Decisions:**

1. **`signalStore()`** creates a fully typed store as an injectable Angular service
2. **`patchState()`** ensures immutable updates without Immer dependency
3. **`withEntities()`** provides standardized entity management (normalized `ids`/`entityMap` structure with built-in CRUD updaters)
4. **`rxMethod()`** bridges Angular Signals with RxJS for complex async flows
5. **Protected state** (v18+) prevents external mutations by default; v19+ applies deep freeze recursively

**State Ownership:**

| State Type            | Solution                 | Reason                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Server/API data       | HTTP services + rxMethod | Caching in store, fetch via services |
| Shared client state   | SignalStore              | Reactivity, composition, DevTools    |
| Component-local state | Angular signals          | Simpler, no overhead                 |
| URL state (filters)   | Router query params      | Shareable, bookmarkable              |

</philosophy>

<patterns>

## Core Patterns

### Pattern 1: Basic Store with signalStore

Create stores using `signalStore()` with `withState`, `withComputed`, and `withMethods`.

#### Feature Ordering

Features execute in order. State features must come first:

1. `withState()` - Define state
2. `withComputed()` - Derived values from state
3. `withMethods()` - Actions that update state
4. `withHooks()` - Lifecycle hooks (onInit, onDestroy)

For implementation examples, see [examples/core.md](examples/core.md).

---

### Pattern 2: State Updates with patchState

Use `patchState()` for all state modifications. It ensures immutability and proper signal notifications.

#### When to Use

- Synchronous state updates
- Partial state updates (spread not needed)
- Inside `withMethods()` and custom features

#### Key Behaviors

- Accepts partial state object or updater functions
- Multiple updaters can be passed to single call
- Works with entity updaters from `@ngrx/signals/entities`

For implementation examples, see [examples/core.md](examples/core.md).

---

### Pattern 3: Entity Management with withEntities

Use `withEntities()` for collections of items with IDs. Provides standardized CRUD operations and efficient lookups.

#### When to Use

- Lists of items with unique identifiers
- CRUD operations on collections
- Need for efficient ID-based lookups
- Multiple entity collections in one store

#### Available Updaters

- `setAllEntities()` - Replace all entities
- `addEntity()` / `addEntities()` - Add new entities
- `setEntity()` / `setEntities()` - Upsert entities
- `updateEntity()` / `updateEntities()` - Partial updates
- `removeEntity()` / `removeEntities()` - Delete entities

For implementation examples, see [examples/entities.md](examples/entities.md).

---

### Pattern 4: RxJS Integration with rxMethod

Use `rxMethod()` for side effects that need RxJS operators (debounce, switchMap, etc.).

#### When to Use

- Debounced search/filtering
- Cancellable HTTP requests
- Complex async flows with multiple operators
- Reactive streams from signals

#### Key Behaviors

- Accepts `Observable<T>`, `Signal<T>`, or `T` as input
- Factory function receives `Observable<T>` for piping
- Runs in injection context (can use `inject()`)
- Auto-unsubscribes on store destroy

For implementation examples, see [examples/effects.md](examples/effects.md).

---

### Pattern 4b: Signal-Only Side Effects with signalMethod (v19+)

Use `signalMethod()` for side effects that don't need RxJS operators.

#### When to Use

- Simple side effects without RxJS dependency
- When you want to work purely with Signals
- Side effects that don't require debounce/switchMap/cancellation
- When injection context is not available

#### Key Behaviors

- Accepts `Signal<T>` or `T` as input (no Observable)
- Processor function runs independently of injection context
- Only parameter signals are tracked; internal signals remain untracked
- You must handle race conditions manually (no built-in switchMap)

#### rxMethod vs signalMethod

| Feature                         | `rxMethod`                  | `signalMethod` |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| RxJS required                   | Yes                         | No             |
| Operators (debounce, switchMap) | Yes                         | No             |
| Race condition handling         | Built-in                    | Manual         |
| Input types                     | T, Signal<T>, Observable<T> | T, Signal<T>   |

For implementation examples, see [examples/effects.md](examples/effects.md).

---

### Pattern 5: Custom Features with signalStoreFeature

Use `signalStoreFeature()` to create reusable store functionality.

#### When to Use

- Shared patterns across multiple stores (loading state, error handling)
- Encapsulated feature modules
- Third-party store extensions
- DRY principle for repeated store logic

#### Type Constraints

Use `type()` helper to specify required store members:

- Ensures feature is only used with compatible stores
- Provides full type inference
- Enables composition of features

For implementation examples, see [examples/features.md](examples/features.md).

---

### Pattern 6: Lifecycle Hooks with withHooks

Use `withHooks()` for initialization and cleanup logic.

#### Available Hooks

- `onInit()` - Called when store is instantiated
- `onDestroy()` - Called when store is destroyed

#### Common Use Cases

- Loading initial data on store creation
- Setting up subscriptions
- Cleanup of resources
- DevTools initialization

For implementation examples, see [examples/core.md](examples/core.md).

---

### Pattern 7: Call State Pattern

Track loading, loaded, and error states for async operations using `withCallState()` from ngrx-toolkit or custom implementation.

#### States

- `loading` - Operation in progress
- `loaded` - Operation completed successfully
- `error` - Operation failed with error

#### Benefits

- Consistent loading UI patterns
- Error handling standardization
- Multiple collection support
- DevTools visibility

For implementation examples, see [examples/features.md](examples/features.md).

---

### Pattern 8: Context-Aware Features with withFeature (v20+)

Use `withFeature()` to create features that have access to the current store's methods and properties. Unlike `signalStoreFeature()`, `withFeature` receives the store instance, enabling reusable features that can call store-specific methods.

#### When to Use

- Features that need to call existing store methods
- Generic patterns like entity loaders that need store-specific fetch logic
- When `signalStoreFeature()` is insufficient because the feature needs store context

```typescript
import { withFeature } from "@ngrx/signals";

// withFeature receives the store instance
export const ProductStore = signalStore(
  { providedIn: "root" },
  withMethods((store) => ({
    load: rxMethod<string>(/* fetch logic */),
  })),
  withFeature((store) =>
    withEntityLoader((id) => firstValueFrom(store.load(id))),
  ),
);
```

---

### Pattern 9: Derived Reactive State with withLinkedState (v20+)

Use `withLinkedState()` to create state signals that are automatically recomputed when their source signals change. Unlike `withComputed()`, linked state is writable and can be overridden.

#### When to Use

- Derived state that also needs to be independently settable
- Maintaining selection state across data changes
- State that has a default derived value but can be overridden by user action

```typescript
import { withLinkedState } from "@ngrx/signals";

export const FilterStore = signalStore(
  withState({ items: [] as Item[] }),
  withLinkedState(({ items }) => ({
    // Recomputes when items change, but can also be set independently
    selectedId: () => items()[0]?.id ?? null,
  })),
);
```

</patterns>

<integration>

## Integration Guide

**Angular DI Integration:**

SignalStore is an Angular service. Use `{ providedIn: 'root' }` for singletons or component-level `providers: [Store]` for scoped instances that are destroyed with the component.

See [examples/core.md](examples/core.md) Pattern 5 and Component-Level Stores for DI patterns.

**DevTools Integration:**

Use `withDevtools('name')` from `@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit` for Redux DevTools support. Place it before `withState` in the feature chain.

See [examples/features.md](examples/features.md) Pattern 5 for setup.

**Testing Integration:**

- Use `unprotected()` from `@ngrx/signals/testing` to bypass state protection for test setup
- Use `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` with mocked services
- Test store methods directly or through component integration

See [examples/testing.md](examples/testing.md) for patterns.

</integration>

<red_flags>

## RED FLAGS

**High Priority Issues:**

- Mutating state directly instead of using `patchState` - breaks reactivity and signal notifications
- Using arrays instead of `withEntities` for entity collections - loses normalized state, O(1) lookups
- Not wrapping async RxJS flows in `rxMethod` - loses cancellation and proper cleanup
- Accessing store state outside computed/template - may not trigger updates

**Medium Priority Issues:**

- Missing error handling in `rxMethod` pipelines
- Deeply nested state (flatten with multiple state slices)
- Not using `entityConfig()` for custom entity IDs (v18+)
- Using `signalMethod` for async operations with race conditions (use `rxMethod` with `switchMap`)

**Gotchas & Edge Cases:**

- `withHooks.onInit()` runs during store instantiation - be careful with side effects in tests
- `patchState` with entity updaters requires `collection` option when using named collections
- `rxMethod` auto-unsubscribes on destroy - do not manually unsubscribe
- Protected state (v18+) prevents external `patchState` calls by default
- Feature execution order matters - later features can access earlier ones
- **v19+ Deep Freeze**: State values are recursively frozen with `Object.freeze` in dev mode - use `withProps()` for mutable objects like FormGroup

See [reference.md](reference.md) for detailed anti-patterns with code examples.
