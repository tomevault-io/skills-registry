## Understanding AgentScope
### What is AgentScope?
AgentScope is a production-ready, enterprise-grade open-source framework for building multi-agent applications with large language models. Its functionalities cover:

- **Development**: ReAct agent, context compression, short/long-term memory, tool use, human-in-the-loop, multi-agent orchestration, agent hooks, structured output, planning, integration with MCP, agent skill, LLMs API, voice interaction (TTS/Realtime), RAG
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate multistep agentic applications with statistical analysis
- **Training**: Agentic reinforcement learning
- **Deployment**: Session/state management, sandbox, local/serverless/Kubernetes deployment

### Installation
```bash
pip install agentscope
# or
uv pip install agentscope
```

### Core Concepts
- **Message**: The core abstraction for information exchange between agents. Supports heterogeneous content blocks (text, images, tool calls, tool results).
```python
from agentscope.message import Msg, TextBlock, ImageBlock, URLSource

msg = Msg(
    name="user",
    content=[TextBlock("Hello world"), ImageBlock(type="image", source=URLSource(type="url", url="..."))],
    role="user"
)
```
- **Agent**: LLM-empowered agent that can reason, use tools, and generate responses through iterative thinking and action loops.
- **Toolkit**: Register and manage tools (Python functions, MCP, agent skills) that agents can call.
- **Memory**: Store `Msg` objects as conversation history/context with a marking mechanism for advanced memory management (compression, retrieval).
- **ChatModel**: Unified interface across different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DashScope, Ollama, etc.) with support for tool use and streaming.
- **Formatter**: Convert `Msg` objects to LLM API-specific formats. Must be used with the corresponding ChatModel. Supports multi-agent conversations with different agent identifiers.

### Basic Usage Examples
#### Example 1: Simple Chatbot
```python
from agentscope.agent import ReActAgent, UserAgent
from agentscope.model import DashScopeChatModel
from agentscope.formatter import DashScopeChatFormatter
from agentscope.memory import InMemoryMemory
from agentscope.tool import Toolkit, execute_python_code, execute_shell_command
import os, asyncio

async def main():
    # Initialize toolkit with tools
    toolkit = Toolkit()
    toolkit.register_tool_function(execute_python_code)
    toolkit.register_tool_function(execute_shell_command)

    # Create ReActAgent with model, memory, formatter, and toolkit
    agent = ReActAgent(
        name="Friday",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Friday.",
        model=DashScopeChatModel(
            model_name="qwen-max",
            api_key=os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
            stream=True,
        ),
        memory=InMemoryMemory(),
        formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
        toolkit=toolkit,
    )

    # Create user agent for terminal input
    user = UserAgent(name="user")

    # Conversation loop
    msg = None
    while True:
        msg = await agent(msg)  # Agent processes and replies
        msg = await user(msg)   # User inputs next message
        if msg.get_text_content() == "exit":
            break

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Example 2: Multi-Agent Conversation
AgentScope adopts explicit message passing for multi-agent conversations (PyTorch-like dynamic graph), allowing flexible information flow control.

```python
alice, bob, carol, david = ReActAgent(...), ReActAgent(...), ReActAgent(...), ReActAgent(...)

msg_alice = await alice()
msg_bob = await bob(msg_alice)  # Bob receives Alice's message and generate a reply. Alice doesn't receive Bob's message unless explicitly passed back.
msg_carol = await carol(msg_alice)  # Similarly, the agent cannot receive messages from other agents unless explicitly passed.

# Broadcasting with MsgHub, a syntactic sugar for message broadcasting within a group of agents
from agentscope.pipeline import MsgHub

async with MsgHub(
    participants=[alice, bob, carol],
    announcement=Msg("Host", "Let's discuss", "user")
) as hub:
    await alice()  # Bob and Carol receive this
    await bob()    # Alice and Carol receive this

    # Manual broadcast
    await hub.broadcast(Msg("Host", "New topic", "user"))

    # Dynamic participant management
    hub.add(david)
    hub.delete(bob)
```

#### Example 3: Master-Worker Pattern
Wrap worker agents as tools for the master agent.

```python
from agentscope.tool import ToolResponse, Toolkit

async def create_worker(task: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """Create a worker agent for the given task.

    Args:
        task (`str`): The given task, which should be specific and concise.
    """
    task_msg = Msg(name="master", content=task, role="user") # Use the input task or wrap it into a more complex prompt
    worker = ReActAgent(...)
    res = await worker(task_msg)
    return ToolResponse(content=res.content) # Return the worker's response as the tool response

toolkit = Toolkit()
toolkit.register_tool_function(create_worker)
```

## Working with AgentScope
This section provides guidance on how to effectively answer questions about AgentScope or coding with the framework.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository First

**CRITICAL**: Before doing anything else, clone or update the AgentScope repository. The repository contains essential examples and references.

```bash
# Clone into this skill directory so that you can refer to it across different sessions
cd /path/to/this/skill/directory
git clone -b main https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope.git

# Or update if already cloned
cd /path/to/this/skill/directory/agentscope
git pull
```

**Why this matters**: The repository contains working examples, complete API documentation in source code, and implementation patterns that are more reliable than guessing.

### Step 2: Understand the Repository Structure
The cloned repository is organized as follows. Note this may be outdated as the project evolves, you should always check the actual structure after cloning.

```

### Step 3: Browse Examples by Category

When looking for similar implementations, **browse the examples directory by category** rather than searching by keywords alone:
1. **Start with the category** that matches your use case:
   - Building a specific agent type? → `examples/agent/`
   - Multi-agent system? → `examples/workflows/`
   - Need a specific feature (MCP, RAG, session)? → `examples/functionality/`
   - Deployment patterns? → `examples/deployment/`
2. **List the subdirectories** to see what's available:
   - Use file listing tools to explore directory structure
   - Read directory names to understand what each example covers
3. **Read example files** to understand implementation patterns:
   - Most examples contain a main script and supporting files
   - Look for README files in subdirectories for explanations
4. **Combine with text search** when needed:
   - After identifying relevant directories, search within them for specific patterns
   - Search for class names, method calls, or specific functionality

**Example workflow**:
```
User asks: "Build a FastAPI app with AgentScope"
→ Browse: List files in examples/deployment/
→ Check: Are there any web service examples?
→ Search: Look for "fastapi", "flask", "api", "server" in examples/
→ Read: Found examples and adapt to user's needs
```

## Step 4: Verify Functionality Exists
Before implementing custom solutions, verify if AgentScope already provides the functionality:

1. **List required functionalities** (e.g., session management, MCP integration, RAG)
2. **Check if provided**:
   - Browse `examples` for examples
   - Search tutorial documentation in `docs/tutorial/`
   - Use the provided scripts (see Part 3) to explore API structure
   - Read source code in `src/agentscope/` for implementation details
3. **If not provided**: Check how to customize by reading base classes and inheritance patterns in source code

### Step 5: Make a Plan
Always create a plan before coding:
1. Identify what AgentScope components you'll use
2. Determine what needs custom implementation
3. Outline the architecture and data flow
4. Consider edge cases and error handling

### Step 6: Code with API Reference
When writing code:
1. **Check docstrings and arguments** before using any class/method
   - Read source code files to see signatures and documentation, or
   - Use the provided scripts to view module/class structures
   - **NEVER** make up classes, methods, or arguments
2. **Check parent classes** - A class's functionality includes inherited methods
3. **Manage lifecycle** - Clean up resources when needed (close connections, release memory)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Guessing API signatures without checking documentation
- ❌ Implementing features that already exist in AgentScope
- ❌ Mixing incompatible Model and Formatter (e.g., OpenAI model with DashScope formatter)
- ❌ Forgetting to await async agent calls
- ❌ Not checking parent class methods when searching for functionality
- ❌ Searching by keywords only without browsing the organized examples directory structure
