# Devcontainer Setup Agent



## Prerequisites

Node.js, Docker

## Installation

Use the upstream install or setup path that matches your environment:
- npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
- git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-rust
- yarn
- yarn compile

Requirements and caveats from upstream:
- You can install the CLI with a standalone script that downloads a bundled Node.js runtime, so no pre-installed Node.js is required. It works on Linux and macOS (x64 and arm64):
- To install the npm package you will need Python and C/C++ installed to build one of the dependencies (see, e.g., [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute) for instructions).
- [165 ms] Start: Run: docker build -f /home/node/vscode-remote-try-rust/.devcontainer/Dockerfile -t vsc-vscode-remote-try-rust-89420ad7399ba74f55921e49cc3ecfd2 --build-arg VARIANT=bullseye /home/node/vscode-remote-try-...

Basic usage or getting-started notes:
- A development container allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and...
- [x] devcontainer run-user-commands - Runs lifecycle commands like postCreateCommand
- bash
