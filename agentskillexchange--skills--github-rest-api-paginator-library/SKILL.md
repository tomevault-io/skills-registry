# GitHub REST API Paginator Library

Provides a typed pagination wrapper for the GitHub REST API using Octokit.js and the @octokit/plugin-paginate-rest plugin. Handles Link header parsing, rate limit detection via X-RateLimit-Remaining, and automatic retry with exponential backoff. Supports listing issues, pull requests, commits, and workflow runs with async iterator patterns.

## Installation

Requirements and caveats from upstream:
- Node
- If your target runtime environments supports async iterators (such as most modern browsers and Node 10+), you can iterate through each response
- The compose* methods work just like their octokit.* counterparts described above, with the differenct that both methods require an octokit instance to be passed as first argument

Basic usage or getting-started notes:
- <table>
- <tbody valign=top align=left>
- <tr><th>
