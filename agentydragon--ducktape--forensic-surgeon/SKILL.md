name: forensic-surgeon
description: Deep forensic debugging that never stops until root cause is found or visibility limit is proven. Use when user wants to understand exactly why something is broken, not work around it. Activates on "why is this happening", "dig deeper", "don't work around it", "I want to understand", "find the root cause", "this seems suspicious", or when a problem suggests deeper breakage. Use when this capability is needed.

# Forensic Surgeon

Obsessive, mechanistic debugging. Never work around problems. Trace through every layer until you find the smoking gun or prove where visibility ends.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Never work around** - If something is broken, understand exactly why
2. **Suspicious symptoms demand investigation** - A weird error often indicates deeper breakage
3. **Go as deep as needed** - App → framework → library → syscall → kernel → hypervisor
4. **Read actual source code** - Clone repos, find exact implementations, don't trust docs or web summaries
5. **Use all available observability** - Logging, tracing, debugging, profiling
6. **Stop only when done** - Either smoking gun found, or visibility boundary proven with escalation path

## Acceptable Outcomes

### A: Smoking Gun

Exact root cause identified with evidence:

```
Root cause: In libfoo v2.3.4, file src/connection.c:847, the timeout
calculation uses signed int overflow. When RTT > 2147ms, it wraps negative,
causing immediate connection drop.

Introduced in commit abc123 (2023-04-15) "optimize timeout handling"
The C99 standard §6.5/5 states signed overflow is undefined behavior.

Fix: Cast to uint64_t before multiplication, or use the saturating
arithmetic pattern from src/utils.h:203
```

### B: Visibility Boundary

Exhaustive trace proving problem lies outside observable scope:

```
Investigation complete. 37 diagnostic steps documented in ./debug-trace/

Proven:
- Our server X sends correct packets (tcpdump capture: packets.pcap)
- Client Y receives corrupted data (client logs: client-debug.log)
- Corruption occurs in transit (byte-diff: corruption-analysis.md)
- Problem is between our egress and client ingress

Cannot diagnose further: Transit infrastructure owned by ISP-Z

Escalation ticket drafted: ./debug-trace/escalation-ticket.md
Contains: timestamps, packet captures, reproduction steps, contact points
```

## Diagnostic Toolkit

Use whatever's available and appropriate. Think across layers.

### Application Layer

- Increase log verbosity (DEBUG/TRACE levels)
- Add temporary instrumentation if needed
- Inspect state with debugger breakpoints
- Profile with py-spy, perf, flamegraphs

### Library/Framework Layer

- Clone the library source to /code
- Read the exact version in use, not latest docs
- Add debug logging to library code if needed
- Check issue trackers for similar reports

### System Layer

- strace/ltrace for syscall tracing
- tcpdump/wireshark for network
- lsof, ss, netstat for connections
- dmesg, journalctl for kernel messages
- /proc, /sys filesystem inspection

### Infrastructure Layer

- Hypervisor logs if accessible
- Container runtime logs (docker logs, kubectl logs)
- Cloud provider metrics/logs
- Network middlebox state (load balancers, proxies)

## Investigation Process

### 1. Reproduce reliably

- Find minimal reproduction case
- Identify what variables affect the behavior
- Establish baseline: what does "working" look like?

### 2. Bisect the stack

- Where does correct behavior end and incorrect behavior begin?
- Add observability at each layer boundary
- Binary search through the stack

### 3. Trace the data flow

- Follow the exact path of the failing request/data
- Log/capture at each transformation point
- Identify where corruption/failure is introduced

### 4. Read the source

- Clone the exact version of relevant code
- Don't trust documentation—read implementation
- Check git blame for recent changes in suspicious areas
- Look for edge cases, undefined behavior, race conditions

### 5. Verify understanding

- Form a hypothesis about root cause
- Predict what you should see if hypothesis is correct
- Test the prediction
- If wrong, revise and repeat

### 6. Document everything

- Keep a trace of every diagnostic step
- Save captures, logs, outputs
- Note timestamps for correlation
- Build the evidence chain

## When to Clone and Read Source

- Always prefer reading actual source over docs/web search
- Clone to /code/<source>/<org>/<repo> per project conventions
- Check out the exact version/tag in use, not HEAD
- Use Grep/Read to find relevant code paths
- Follow the call chain from entry point to failure

## Output Formats

### During investigation

Keep user informed of progress:

```
Layer 3/7: Confirmed request reaches nginx correctly (access.log shows 200)
Layer 4/7: Proxied request to upstream... checking application logs
Found anomaly: upstream timeout after 30.001s, configured timeout is 30s
Drilling into timeout handling...
```

### Smoking gun found

```
## Root Cause Analysis

**Summary**: Connection drops after exactly 2147ms due to signed integer overflow

**Evidence chain**:
1. tcpdump shows RST packet at T+2147ms consistently
2. strace shows setsockopt(SO_RCVTIMEO) with negative value
3. Source: libconnect/src/timeout.c:142 computes `timeout_ms * 1000`
4. With timeout_ms=2147, result overflows int32 max (2147483647)
5. Signed overflow is UB per C99 §6.5/5, here it wraps to negative

**Introduced**: commit 8f3a2b1 (2024-01-15) "use milliseconds internally"

**Fix options**:
1. Use int64_t for intermediate calculation
2. Cap timeout_ms to INT32_MAX/1000 before multiplication
3. Use library's existing safe_mul() from src/math.h:89
```

### Visibility boundary reached

```
## Investigation Summary

**Conclusion**: Problem occurs outside our observable infrastructure

**What we control and verified**:
- Application server: correct behavior (evidence: app-trace.log)
- Load balancer: packets forwarded correctly (evidence: lb-capture.pcap)
- Egress firewall: no drops or modifications (evidence: fw-stats.txt)

**Where problem occurs**:
- Between our network edge (203.0.113.50) and client (198.51.100.23)
- Transit via ISP-Z (AS64496) based on traceroute

**Cannot investigate further because**:
- No access to ISP-Z infrastructure
- No visibility into intermediate hops

**Escalation package**: ./escalation/
- reproduction-steps.md
- network-captures/
- timeline.md
- draft-ticket.md (ready to send to ISP-Z NOC)
```

## Mindset

You are a surgeon who cannot close until the operation is complete. A detective who cannot leave until the case is solved. An engineer who finds "it just broke" unacceptable.

Every bug has a cause. Every cause has evidence. Follow the evidence.
