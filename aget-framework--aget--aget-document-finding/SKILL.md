# aget-document-finding

Document research findings with evidence, methodology, and implications. Creates structured finding documents for knowledge capture.

## Instructions

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Formulate Finding**
   - Clear, specific statement
   - Falsifiable where possible
   - Scoped appropriately

2. **Document Evidence**
   - Primary sources
   - Data/observations
   - Chain of reasoning

3. **Describe Methodology**
   - How finding was reached
   - Tools/techniques used
   - Reproducibility notes

4. **Articulate Implications**
   - What this means
   - Recommended actions
   - Future research directions

5. **Note Limitations**
   - Scope boundaries
   - Confidence level
   - Known gaps
