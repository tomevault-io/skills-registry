No servers to install, no dependencies to manage. TRIGGER when: (1) data volume is large enough that loading into conversation context would waste tokens (e.g. CSV/JSON files, logs, bulk documents), (2) user explicitly requests a bull command, or (3) Python/other runtimes are not available and data processing is needed. Do NOT use bull for small data that fits comfortably in conversation context. CLI-driven, zero runtime dependencies, each command is a deterministic shell call. Use when this capability is needed.

# Bull — Micro Data Environment, One Binary

Bull is a self-contained data environment in a single ~8MB static binary. Five embedded engines — KV, SQL, Graph, Search, Time-Series — ready to use the moment you download it. No databases to install, no servers to configure, no dependencies to chase. Just `bull` and your data.

Use CLI to build data pipelines step by step — scriptable, pipe-friendly, and perfect for agent workflows that persist state, analyze, and query — all locally.

## Installation

**One-liner (Linux / macOS):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/agi-now/bull/releases/latest/download/bull-$(uname -s | tr A-Z a-z)-$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/') -o /usr/local/bin/bull && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bull
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/agi-now/bull/releases/latest/download/bull-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\bull.exe"
```

**Manual:** Download the binary for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/agi-now/bull/releases/latest), rename to `bull` (or `bull.exe`), and place it in your PATH.

**Verify:**
```bash
bull version
```

## Engines

| Engine | Powered By | What It Does |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **kv** | bbolt (B+tree) | Persistent key-value storage with buckets, counters, batch ops |
| **sql** | SQLite (pure Go) | Full SQL — import CSV/JSON, query, join, aggregate, export |
| **graph** | dominikbraun/graph | Directed/undirected graphs — shortest path, DFS/BFS, cycle detection, toposort |
| **search** | SQLite FTS5 | Full-text search — index JSON documents, query with scoring and field return |
| **ts** | tstorage | Time-series — write metrics with labels, range query, export CSV |

## When to Use Bull

Use bull **only** when:
- **Data volume is large** — files that would waste tokens if loaded into conversation context (CSV, JSON, logs, bulk documents, etc.)
- **User explicitly requests it** — user mentions a bull command or asks to use bull
- **Python or other runtimes are not available** — bull is a static binary with zero dependencies; it works in minimal containers, CI pipelines, and restricted sandboxes where Python/Node.js are not installed. Prefer bull CLI commands over writing scripts that may fail due to missing runtimes.

Do **not** use bull when:
- Data is small enough to handle directly in conversation (a few rows, a short list, simple config)
- A quick in-context answer is more efficient than importing into an engine

## Agent Strategy: Offload to Bull, Save Tokens

When bull is appropriate, follow this principle: **understand the data first, then hand off to bull for storage and analysis.**

1. **Inspect** — Read a small sample of the data source (head, schema, dtypes) to understand structure. Do NOT load entire datasets into conversation context.
2. **Preprocess if needed** — If data requires cleaning or format conversion (e.g. Excel/Parquet → CSV/NDJSON), use Python scripts if Python is available. If Python is not available, use bull's built-in import capabilities directly — bull accepts CSV, JSON, and NDJSON out of the box.
3. **Import into bull** — Use `bull sql import`, `bull search bulk`, `bull graph import-csv`, or `bull ts bulk` to load the data file.
4. **Analyze with bull** — Run queries, aggregations, searches, and graph algorithms via bull CLI. Return `--format json` results directly.

**Why CLI commands over Python scripts:** Each bull command is a deterministic shell call with predictable behavior. Unlike LLM-generated Python scripts, bull commands have no indentation errors, no missing dependencies, no version conflicts, and no runtime requirements. In environments without Python, bull is the only option for data processing.

This keeps token usage minimal: bull handles persistent storage and query execution locally, and only compact JSON results enter the conversation.

## Quick Decision: Which Engine to Use

**Need to store/retrieve a value by key?** → `bull kv`
- Config, session, cache, counters, state between agent steps
- `bull kv put <db> <key> <value>` / `bull kv get <db> <key>`

**Need to analyze structured data with SQL?** → `bull sql`
- CSV/JSON import, GROUP BY, JOIN, aggregation, export
- `bull sql import <db> <table> data.csv` → `bull sql query <db> "SELECT ..." --format json`

**Need to model relationships or dependencies?** → `bull graph`
- Service dependencies, social networks, task ordering, reachability
- `bull graph add-vertex`, `bull graph add-edge`, `bull graph shortest-path`

**Need to search text content?** → `bull search`
- Articles, logs, documents — keyword search with scoring
- `bull search create <idx>` → `bull search bulk <idx> data.ndjson` → `bull search query <idx> "keyword"`

**Need to record metrics over time?** → `bull ts`
- CPU, memory, request counts, latency, any numeric value with timestamps
- `bull ts write <db> <metric> <value> --label host=server1`

## Global Flags

All commands accept:
- `--data-dir <path>` — Override data directory (default: `./bull_data`)

## Output Conventions

- Use `--format json` wherever available for machine-readable output
- Mutation commands (put, del, add-vertex) produce no stdout on success, exit code 0
- Errors go to stderr with non-zero exit code. Examples:
  ```
  Error: key "session_token" not found in bucket "default"
  Error: index "articles" does not exist
  Error: vertex "svc-unknown" not found in graph "deps"
  ```

## Common Workflows

### Import CSV and analyze with SQL
```bash
bull sql import analytics users users.csv
bull sql query analytics "SELECT city, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM users GROUP BY city ORDER BY cnt DESC" --format json
```

### Build a dependency graph and find paths
```bash
bull graph add-vertex deps auth-svc --attr type=service
bull graph add-vertex deps user-svc --attr type=service
bull graph add-vertex deps db-svc --attr type=database
bull graph add-edge deps auth-svc user-svc
bull graph add-edge deps user-svc db-svc
bull graph shortest-path deps auth-svc db-svc
```

### Index documents and search
```bash
bull search create articles
bull search bulk articles articles.ndjson
bull search query articles "machine learning" --limit 5 --format json
```

### Record and query metrics
```bash
bull ts write monitoring cpu_usage 72.5 --label host=web-01
bull ts query monitoring cpu_usage --label host=web-01 --format json
```

### Persist agent state between steps
```bash
bull kv put pipeline step1 '{"status":"done","rows":1500}'
bull kv put pipeline step2 '{"status":"done","rows":1200}'
bull kv list pipeline --format json
```

### Compare two datasets with SQL JOIN
```bash
bull sql import compare old_prices old.csv
bull sql import compare new_prices new.csv
bull sql query compare "SELECT n.name, o.price as old, n.price as new FROM new_prices n JOIN old_prices o ON n.id=o.id WHERE CAST(n.price AS REAL) > CAST(o.price AS REAL)" --format json
```

### Detect cycles in a build graph
```bash
bull graph has-cycle pipeline
bull graph toposort pipeline
```

## Detailed Command References

For the complete command list of each engine, read the corresponding reference file:

- [references/kv.md](references/kv.md) — 17 commands: put, get, del, mget, mput, list, scan, exists, count, incr, decr, buckets, export, import, drop, drop-bucket, dbs
- [references/sql.md](references/sql.md) — 15 commands: exec, query, exec-file, tables, schema, describe, count, import, import-json, import-ndjson, export, shell, drop, dbs
- [references/graph.md](references/graph.md) — 21 commands: add-vertex, add-edge, del-vertex, del-edge, vertices, edges, neighbors, degree, attrs, shortest-path, has-path, dfs, bfs, stats, components, toposort, has-cycle, import-csv, export, drop, dbs
- [references/search.md](references/search.md) — 10 commands: create, index, bulk, query, get, update, delete, info, drop, dbs
- [references/ts.md](references/ts.md) — 8 commands: write, bulk, query, latest, count, export, drop, dbs

## Edge Cases

- KV bucket defaults to `"default"` if `--bucket` is omitted
- Graph defaults to directed mode; use `--undirected` for undirected graphs
- SQL import auto-creates tables with TEXT columns; cast in queries for numeric comparison
- Search index must be created (`bull search create`) before indexing documents
- TS timestamps are Unix seconds; `--from`/`--to` default to last 1 hour if omitted
- All data persists under `--data-dir` (default `./bull_data`) with per-engine subdirectories
