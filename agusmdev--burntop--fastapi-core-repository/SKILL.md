# FastAPI Core Repository (Abstract)

## Overview

This skill covers creating the abstract base repository that defines the interface for all data access operations. This is the contract that concrete implementations must follow.

## Create core/repository.py

Create `src/app/core/repository.py`:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from collections.abc import Sequence
from typing import Any, Generic, TypeVar
from uuid import UUID

from fastapi_filter.contrib.sqlalchemy import Filter
from fastapi_pagination import Params
from fastapi_pagination.bases import AbstractPage
from pydantic import BaseModel

from app.core.models import Base

# Type variables for generic repository
ModelType = TypeVar("ModelType", bound=Base)
CreateSchemaType = TypeVar("CreateSchemaType", bound=BaseModel)
UpdateSchemaType = TypeVar("UpdateSchemaType", bound=BaseModel)


class AbstractRepository(ABC, Generic[ModelType, CreateSchemaType, UpdateSchemaType]):
    """
    Abstract base repository defining the interface for data access.

    This is the ONLY place where SQL/database operations should be defined.
    All methods are async and work with SQLAlchemy models.

    Type Parameters:
        ModelType: SQLAlchemy model class
        CreateSchemaType: Pydantic schema for create operations
        UpdateSchemaType: Pydantic schema for update operations

## Interface Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility

Each method does one thing and does it well.

### 2. Explicit Soft Delete Handling

- Default methods exclude soft-deleted records
- `*_with_deleted` methods include soft-deleted records
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. Type Safety

Using generics provides full type safety:

```python
class ItemRepository(PostgresRepository[Item, ItemCreate, ItemUpdate]):
    pass

# Now fully typed:
item: Item = await repo.create(ItemCreate(name="test"))
```

### 4. Async-First

All methods are async, designed for async SQLAlchemy.

### 5. Pagination Integration

Built-in support for fastapi-pagination.

### 6. Filter Integration

Built-in support for fastapi-filter.

## Method Categories

| Category        | Methods                                    | Purpose             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Basic CRUD**  | create, get_by_id, get_all, update, delete | Standard operations |
| **Pagination**  | get_paginated, get_filtered, count         | List operations     |
| **Bulk**        | bulk_create, bulk_upsert, bulk_delete      | Batch operations    |
| **Soft Delete** | soft_delete, restore, \*\_with_deleted     | Deletion management |
| **Utility**     | exists, get_by_ids, get_by_field           | Convenience methods |

## Notes

- This abstract class defines the interface only
- See `fastapi-postgres-repository` skill for PostgreSQL implementation
- Entity repositories inherit from the concrete implementation, not this abstract class
