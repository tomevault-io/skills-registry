# Python Testing

## Overview

Test observable behavior and contracts, not internal implementation.
Keep unit tests fast, deterministic, and patched at module boundaries.

These are preferred defaults for common cases.
When a default conflicts with project constraints, suggest a better-fit alternative, call out tradeoffs, and note compensating controls.

## Invocation Notice

- Inform the user when this skill is being invoked by name: `python-testing`.

## When to Use

- Writing or reviewing unit, integration, or reliability-sensitive tests.
- Tests are flaky, slow, or coupled to implementation details.
- Adding regression tests after a bugfix.
- Testing async lifecycles, cancellation, or cleanup paths.
- Unsure what test coverage a change needs.
- Testing across multiple Python versions (nox, CI matrix).
- Validating thread safety for free-threaded Python (GIL-disabled builds).

**When NOT to use:**

- Pure data-shape or schema validation (see `python-types-contracts`).
- Production observability or monitoring concerns (see `python-runtime-operations`).
- Concurrency design decisions outside of test harnesses (see `python-concurrency-performance`).

## Quick Reference

- Test observable behavior, not internals.
- Keep unit tests fast and deterministic.
- Patch at module boundaries and import locations used by the unit under test.
- Add regression tests for bugfixes.
- Include timeout/retry/cancellation/cleanup coverage where relevant.
- For multi-Python: use nox with uv backend; parametrize for dependency matrices.
- For free-threaded Python: use `pytest-run-parallel`, set `PYTHON_GIL=0`, always set CI timeouts.

## Change-Specific Diagnostics

- Dependency updates: run `uv run pytest scripts/test_pypi_security_audit.py -v`
- Async-heavy lifecycle changes: run `pyleak` diagnostics.
- Multi-Python support changes: run full matrix via `nox`.
- Free-threaded compatibility: run `PYTHON_GIL=0 uv run --python 3.Xt pytest --parallel-threads=auto --timeout=300` on a free-threaded build (3.13t+).

## Common Mistakes

- **Mocking too deep** — patching internals instead of module-boundary seams makes tests brittle and coupled to implementation.
- **Testing the mock** — verifying mock call counts without asserting on observable output proves nothing about behavior.
- **Missing regression test** — fixing a bug without a test that reproduces it first; the bug will recur.
- **Non-deterministic time/order** — relying on wall-clock time or dict/set ordering instead of injecting clocks and sorting explicitly.
- **Skipping cleanup assertions** — verifying the happy path but never asserting that resources are released on failure or cancellation.
- **No free-threaded CI entry** — shipping multi-threaded code without a free-threaded (`t`-suffixed) matrix entry; the GIL hides race conditions that will surface when free-threaded Python becomes the default.
- **Ignoring GIL re-enablement** — importing a C extension without `Py_mod_gil` silently re-enables the GIL; check `sys._is_gil_enabled()` after imports.
- **YAML version float** — writing `3.10` unquoted in CI matrix YAML; it parses as `3.1` and installs the wrong Python.
