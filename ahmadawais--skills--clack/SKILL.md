description: Comprehensive guidance for building and debugging JavaScript and TypeScript CLIs with @clack/core and @clack/prompts, backed by bundled upstream source and examples. Use when implementing clack prompt flows, deciding between core primitives and styled prompts, adapting clack examples, or validating clack API usage. Use when this capability is needed.

# Clack CLI Skill

Use this skill to implement reliable interactive CLIs with `@clack/core` and `@clack/prompts`.

## Workflow

1. Decide whether to use `@clack/prompts` or `@clack/core`.
2. Read only the minimum reference files needed for the task.
3. Start from the closest example in `references/examples/`.
4. Implement cancellation handling after every prompt.
5. Add UX polish (`intro`, `outro`, `spinner`, `progress`, `tasks`, `log`, `taskLog`, `stream`) when useful.
6. Verify imports against export maps in `references/docs/prompts-exports.ts` and `references/docs/core-exports.ts`.

## Pick the Right Layer

Use `@clack/prompts` by default.
- Choose it for production-ready styling and quick delivery.
- Use it when the request maps to standard prompt types: text, confirm, select, multiselect, grouped prompts, logs, spinners, progress, tasks, or streaming logs.

Use `@clack/core` when lower-level control is required.
- Choose it for custom rendering, custom prompt behavior, or unstyled primitives.
- Use it when the request needs direct prompt classes (`TextPrompt`, `SelectPrompt`, `ConfirmPrompt`, `Prompt`) or deep customization.

## Mandatory Safety Patterns

Handle cancellation on every prompt result.

```ts
import * as p from '@clack/prompts';

const value = await p.text({ message: 'Your name?' });
if (p.isCancel(value)) {
  p.cancel('Operation cancelled.');
  process.exit(0);
}
```

Start and close sessions cleanly for user-facing CLIs.

```ts
p.intro('create-app');
// prompts
p.outro('Done');
```

## Prompt Design Guidance

Use these defaults unless the user asks otherwise.
- `text`: provide `validate` for required or constrained input.
- `confirm`: use for binary decisions; avoid coercing free-form text.
- `select`: use for mutually exclusive choices.
- `multiselect` or `groupMultiselect`: use for multi-choice and hierarchical multi-choice flows.
- `group`: gather structured answers while preserving dependencies between steps.
- `spinner` and `progress`: wrap long-running tasks and update status clearly.
- `tasks`: execute sequential task blocks with spinner status.
- `taskLog`: stream subprocess output and finish with success/failure.
- `stream`: render async or tokenized output (for LLM-style streaming).

## Implementation Sequence

1. Inspect user requirements and identify required prompt primitives.
2. Read the nearest example under `references/examples/`.
3. Confirm function/class availability from:
   - `references/docs/prompts-exports.ts`
   - `references/docs/core-exports.ts`
4. If behavior is unclear, inspect source under:
   - `references/source/prompts/`
   - `references/source/core/`
5. Implement with cancellation guards and clear terminal messaging.
6. Keep fallback behavior for non-interactive contexts when requested (see spinner and CI-oriented examples).

## Reference Loading Strategy

Start with these files.
- `references/docs/prompts-readme.md`
- `references/docs/core-readme.md`
- `references/INDEX.md`

Load specific source files only as needed.
- Prompts wrapper internals: `references/source/prompts/*.ts`
- Core prompt primitives: `references/source/core/prompts/*.ts`
- Core utility behavior: `references/source/core/utils/*.ts`

## Example-First Mapping

Use this quick mapping to avoid re-inventing flows.
- General prompt suite: `references/examples/basic/index.ts`
- Validation: `references/examples/basic/text-validation.ts`
- Autocomplete: `references/examples/basic/autocomplete.ts`
- Autocomplete multi-select: `references/examples/basic/autocomplete-multiselect.ts`
- Defaults: `references/examples/basic/default-value.ts`
- Filesystem path prompt: `references/examples/basic/path.ts`
- Spinner basics: `references/examples/basic/spinner.ts`
- Spinner cancellation: `references/examples/basic/spinner-cancel.ts`
- Advanced spinner cancellation: `references/examples/basic/spinner-cancel-advanced.ts`
- CI-oriented spinner behavior: `references/examples/basic/spinner-ci.ts`
- Timer-style spinner updates: `references/examples/basic/spinner-timer.ts`
- Progress bar: `references/examples/basic/progress.ts`
- Task log streaming: `references/examples/basic/task-log.ts`
- Stream utility: `references/examples/basic/stream.ts`
- Changesets integration flow: `references/examples/changesets/index.ts`

## Quality Bar

Before finalizing any clack implementation:
- Confirm every import exists in the current exports file.
- Ensure cancellation flow always exits safely.
- Ensure prompt wording is short and unambiguous.
- Ensure long-running operations provide visible status.
- Ensure selected layer (`core` vs `prompts`) matches customization needs.
