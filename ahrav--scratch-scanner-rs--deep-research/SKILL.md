# Deep Research

A three-phase evidence-gathering workflow for problems where getting the design
wrong is expensive: safety-critical code, performance-critical paths, distributed
systems protocols, unsafe Rust, concurrency primitives, and novel algorithms.

Research agents independently survey the landscape (papers, production systems,
post-mortems, specifications), a synthesizer cross-references and ranks the
evidence, and an integrator maps findings to a concrete implementation plan
grounded in the codebase.

## When to Use

- **Safety-critical**: unsafe blocks, memory management, lock-free data structures
- **Performance-critical**: hot-path algorithms, cache-aware layouts, SIMD strategies
- **Distributed systems**: consensus, replication, failure detection, ordering
- **Novel or unfamiliar territory**: algorithms you haven't implemented before
- **High-stakes design decisions**: choices that are expensive to reverse
- **Concurrency**: lock strategies, atomic ordering, async runtime interactions

## When NOT to Use

- Straightforward CRUD features or wiring code
- Problems with a single obvious solution
- Tasks where you already have deep domain expertise and just need to code
- Use `design-tournament` instead when the problem is well-understood but
  multiple valid approaches exist

## Invocation

```
deep-research <problem statement>
```

The `<problem statement>` should describe what you're trying to build or decide,
and why existing knowledge is insufficient. If no argument is given, ask the
user for the problem statement before proceeding.

---

## Phase 1 — Research (3-5 Parallel Agents)

Launch **5 research agents in parallel** using the Codex agent tools (`spawn_agent`, `send_input`, `wait`) with
`agent_type=default`. Each agent has a distinct research lens but
receives the same problem statement. All agents explore the codebase for context
AND search the web for external evidence.

**All 5 agents MUST be launched in a single message** (one message, five `spawn_agent` calls) so they run concurrently.

### Research Agent Specialties

Each agent receives the common preamble below, with `{PROBLEM}` replaced by
the user's problem statement, `{AGENT_ID}` set to its label, and
`{SPECIALTY}` / `{FOCUS}` set per-agent.

---

#### Common Preamble (included in every agent's prompt)

```
You are Research Agent {AGENT_ID} — a {SPECIALTY} specialist.

## Problem Under Investigation
{PROBLEM}

## Your Research Mission

You are one of 5 independent research agents. Your job is to gather HARD
EVIDENCE — not opinions — about how this problem has been solved before.
Every claim must have a source. Unsourced claims are worthless.

### Research Process

1. **Understand the codebase context**: Use `rg --files`, `rg`, and targeted file reads to understand
   the relevant parts of the codebase. What exists today? What constraints does
   the current architecture impose?

2. **Search for external evidence**: Use `web.search_query` and `web.open` to find:
   - Academic papers and technical reports
   - Documentation from production systems that solve similar problems
   - RFCs, specifications, and formal descriptions
   - Post-mortems and failure analyses
   - Conference talks, technical blog posts from credible sources
   - Existing open-source implementations

3. **Evaluate and document**: For each piece of evidence, record:
   - Source (URL, paper title, system name)
   - Key finding or technique
   - Relevance to our specific problem
   - Evidence strength (see scale below)

### Evidence Strength Scale

| Level | Label | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| 5 | **Proven at scale** | Battle-tested in production systems handling similar workloads | FoundationDB's simulation testing, TigerBeetle's storage engine |
| 4 | **Peer-reviewed** | Published in reputable venue with formal analysis | OSDI/SOSP paper with proofs |
| 3 | **Implemented & tested** | Open-source implementation with benchmarks/tests | Well-maintained crate with >1k stars, comprehensive test suite |
| 2 | **Documented practice** | Technical blog from credible engineering org | Blog post from Cloudflare, Datadog, AWS engineering |
| 1 | **Anecdotal** | Forum discussion, personal blog, Stack Overflow answer | Useful for leads but needs corroboration |

### Focus Area
{FOCUS}

### Rules

- EVERY finding must have a concrete source. No source = don't include it.
- Prefer primary sources over secondary summaries.
- If you find contradictory evidence, report BOTH sides with sources.
- Distinguish between "X is theoretically optimal" and "X works in production."
- Note when evidence is from a different domain and may not transfer directly.
- Search for COUNTER-evidence too — what are the failure modes of popular approaches?
- If a search returns no useful results, say so. Do not fabricate references.

### Output Format

Return a markdown document starting with:
`# Research Report — Agent {AGENT_ID}: {SPECIALTY}`

Then these sections:

#### 1. Codebase Context
What you found in the current codebase that's relevant. File paths and line
numbers for key structures.

#### 2. Findings
For each piece of evidence (aim for 5-15 findings):

**Finding {N}: {title}**
- **Source**: {URL or citation}
- **Evidence strength**: {1-5} — {label}
- **Summary**: {2-4 sentences}
- **Key technique/insight**: {the actionable takeaway}
- **Applicability to our problem**: {high/medium/low} — {why}
- **Caveats**: {limitations, different assumptions, scaling concerns}

#### 3. Patterns & Consensus
What approaches appear repeatedly across sources? Where do experts agree?

#### 4. Disagreements & Open Questions
Where do sources contradict each other? What remains unresolved?

#### 5. Recommended Reading
Top 3-5 sources the team should read, ranked by relevance.

### Collecting Results

After all 5 agents complete, gather their outputs. If any agent fails or times
out, proceed with the agents that succeeded (minimum 3 required for Phase 2).

---

## Phase 2 — Synthesize (Single Agent)

Launch **1 synthesis agent** using the Codex agent tools (`spawn_agent`, `send_input`, `wait`) with
`agent_type=default`.

### Synthesizer Prompt

```
You are the Research Synthesizer. Five independent research agents have
investigated the same problem from different angles. Your job is to
cross-reference their findings into a single, evidence-ranked knowledge base.

## Original Problem
{PROBLEM}

## Research Reports
{ALL_FIVE_REPORTS}

## Your Task

### 1. Evidence Inventory

Create a master list of ALL unique findings across all 5 agents. For
findings reported by multiple agents, merge them and note corroboration.

For each finding:
- **ID**: F{N}
- **Title**: {descriptive title}
- **Sources**: {all sources citing this finding, with URLs}
- **Corroboration**: {how many agents independently found this}
- **Evidence strength**: {1-5, use the highest-quality source}
- **Applicability**: {high/medium/low for our specific problem}

### 2. Consensus Matrix

Identify the key design decisions for this problem, then for each decision
show where the evidence points:

| Decision | Option A | Option B | Evidence For A | Evidence For B | Verdict |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|----------------|---------|

The verdict should be: STRONG CONSENSUS, LEAN (direction), CONTESTED, or
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.

### 3. Evidence-Ranked Techniques

Rank all discovered techniques/approaches by weighted evidence score:

Score = (evidence_strength × applicability × corroboration_count)

| Rank | Technique | Score | Evidence | Applicability | Corroboration | Key Source |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|---------------|---------------|------------|

### 4. Risk Register

From the failure modes research, compile a risk register:

| Risk ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Source |
|---------|------|------------|--------|------------|--------|

### 5. Contradictions & Gaps

- Where do sources disagree? What's the strongest evidence on each side?
- What aspects of the problem have NO evidence? Where are we flying blind?
- What evidence exists but doesn't transfer to our specific context?

### 6. Key Insights

The 5-10 most important things learned from this research that should
directly influence the design. Each must cite at least one source.

### Rules

- Do NOT add your own findings — you are synthesizing, not researching.
- If an agent's finding has no source, downgrade it to evidence strength 0
  and flag it as UNVERIFIED.
- Preserve ALL source URLs from the original reports.
- If agents contradict each other, present both sides — do not pick a winner
  unless the evidence clearly favors one side.
- Be explicit about what we DON'T know, not just what we do.

### Output Format

Return a markdown document starting with:
`# Research Synthesis`

Include all sections above, plus a final section:

#### Executive Summary
3-5 bullet points capturing the most critical findings for someone who
won't read the full report.
```

---

## Phase 3 — Integrate (Single Agent)

Launch **1 integration agent** using the Codex agent tools (`spawn_agent`, `send_input`, `wait`) with
`agent_type=default`.

This agent maps the synthesized research to a concrete implementation plan
grounded in the actual codebase.

### Integrator Prompt

```
You are the Research-to-Plan Integrator. You have a comprehensive research
synthesis and access to the codebase. Your job is to produce a concrete,
evidence-backed implementation plan.

## Original Problem
{PROBLEM}

## Research Synthesis
{SYNTHESIS_REPORT}

## Your Task

### Step 1: Codebase Mapping

Thoroughly explore the codebase to understand:
- Current architecture and module structure (use `rg --files`, `rg`, and targeted file reads)
- Existing patterns and conventions
- What infrastructure already exists that can be leveraged
- What constraints the current architecture imposes
- Dependencies and their versions

Map each research finding to specific locations in the codebase:
- Which files/modules would be affected?
- What existing abstractions can be reused?
- Where do new abstractions need to be introduced?

### Step 2: Implementation Plan

Produce a step-by-step implementation plan where EVERY design decision
cites evidence from the synthesis:

#### Plan Format

For each step:

**Step {N}: {title}**
- **What**: {concrete description — types, signatures, module placement}
- **Why**: {justification citing specific findings by ID: F1, F7, etc.}
- **Evidence**: {the specific technique/paper/system this is based on}
- **Files**: {exact file paths to create or modify}
- **Risks**: {from the risk register, with mitigation}
- **Acceptance criteria**: {how to verify this step is correct}

### Step 3: Evidence Trail

Create a traceability matrix:

| Plan Step | Research Finding(s) | Evidence Strength | Confidence |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|

Confidence levels:
- HIGH: Multiple strong sources agree, directly applicable
- MEDIUM: Evidence exists but from different context, or sources disagree
- LOW: Limited evidence, based on extrapolation
- NOVEL: No direct evidence found — this is our own design (flag for extra review)

Any step with LOW or NOVEL confidence gets a mandatory note explaining
what additional validation is needed (benchmarks, property tests, fuzzing,
formal verification, etc.).

### Step 4: Alternative Approaches

For any CONTESTED decisions from the synthesis, describe:
- The alternative approach
- What evidence supports it
- Under what conditions we'd switch to it
- How to structure the code so switching is feasible

### Step 5: Validation Strategy

How to verify the implementation is correct:
- What properties should be tested (unit, property-based, fuzz)?
- What benchmarks should be run?
- What failure modes from the risk register need explicit test cases?
- Are there formal verification opportunities (Kani, MIRI)?

### Rules

- Every design decision MUST cite evidence. If there's no evidence for a
  choice, flag it explicitly as NOVEL/UNJUSTIFIED.
- Be concrete: file paths, type signatures, function names. Not hand-waving.
- Respect existing codebase conventions — don't propose patterns alien to
  the project.
- The plan should be implementable by a developer who hasn't read the full
  research — include enough context in each step.
- Include estimated complexity per step (S/M/L) but NOT time estimates.

### Output Format

Return a markdown document starting with:
`# Implementation Plan`

Include all sections above, plus:

#### References
A numbered bibliography of all sources cited in the plan, with URLs.
Each citation in the plan body should reference this list: [1], [2], etc.
```

---

## Final Output Format

After the integrator completes, present the combined output to the user:

```markdown

## Configuration

Default: 5 researchers + 1 synthesizer + 1 integrator (7 total agents).

The user can reduce the research agents:
```
deep-research 3 agents: <problem>
```

Enforce these limits:
- Phase 1: minimum 3 research agents, maximum 5
- If 3 agents: use agents 1 (Theory), 2 (Production Systems), 3 (Failure Modes)
- If 4 agents: add agent 4 (Rust Ecosystem)
- If 5 agents: all five (default)
- Phase 2: always exactly 1 synthesizer
- Phase 3: always exactly 1 integrator

## Tips

- Include relevant file paths or module names in the problem statement so
  research agents can examine the codebase for context.
- For distributed systems problems, the Failure Modes agent (Agent 3) is
  critical — never reduce below 3 agents.
- The output from this skill feeds naturally into `design-tournament` if you
  want to explore multiple implementation approaches after research.
- For unsafe Rust, the Rust Ecosystem agent (Agent 4) is essential for finding
  established safe abstraction patterns.
- Research quality depends on search query quality. The agents will try multiple
  queries but the problem statement should include domain-specific terminology
  to improve results.
