description: Orchestrator testing preset — coordinating comprehensive testing workflows across specialist agents. Manages the full test lifecycle: PLAN (HyperSan) → SPEC-TEST (HyperArch) → ATTACK (HyperRed) → FINAL (HyperSan). Includes adversarial testing, fix cycles, and housekeeping gates. Use this skill when orchestrating testing, validation, or QA workflows across the Hyper agent team. Use when this capability is needed.

# HyperOrch Testing Preset

## Goals
- Orchestrate comprehensive testing workflows
- Coordinate spec tests (HyperArch) and adversarial tests (HyperRed)
- Ensure quality through strategic housekeeping

## When This Applies
Trigger patterns: "test", "validate", "attack", "check", "verify", "QA"

## Testing Protocol

### Phase Structure
```
PLAN (HyperSan) → SPEC-TEST (HyperArch) → ATTACK (HyperRed) → FINAL (HyperSan)
      ↓                  ↓                      ↓                  ↓
   Review Plan      Run Spec Tests        Edge Case Attacks    Final Validation
```

### Phase Flow
```
Phase 1: PLAN
  → HyperSan reviews test plan
  → If issues: Revise plan
  → If approved: Continue

Phase 2: SPEC-TEST (Loop)
  → HyperArch runs spec tests
  → If failures: Fix and re-run (max 3 cycles)
  → If all pass: Continue

Phase 3: ATTACK
  → HyperRed attacks implementation
  → If BLOCKERs found: Return to Phase 2
  → If no BLOCKERs: Continue

Phase 4: FINAL
  → HyperSan final validation
  → Complete
```

## Orchestration Steps

### 1. Initialize Testing
- Parse testing scope from user request
- Identify target module/files
- State: "Starting testing workflow for: [target]"

### 2. Phase 1: PLAN
Invoke HyperSan to review test plan.
→ See [testing-delegation-blocks.md](assets/testing-delegation-blocks.md) for PLAN delegation YAML

**Evaluate Response:**
- If approved → Continue to Phase 2
- If gaps found → Report to user, request clarification

### 3. Phase 2: SPEC-TEST (Loop)
**Cycle Counter:** Start at 1, max 3

Invoke HyperArch with testing standards.
→ See [testing-delegation-blocks.md](assets/testing-delegation-blocks.md) for SPEC-TEST delegation YAML

Testing standards embedded in `execution_guidance`:
→ See [testing-standards.md](assets/testing-standards.md)

**Evaluate Response:**
- If all tests pass → Continue to Phase 3
- If failures remain:
  - Increment cycle counter
  - If cycles < 3: Re-invoke HyperArch with failure details
  - If cycles >= 3: Report persistent failures, suggest manual intervention

**Housekeeping Trigger:**
After every 3 cycles, invoke HyperIQGuard for code quality review.

### 4. Phase 3: ATTACK
Invoke HyperRed for edge case attacks.
→ See [testing-delegation-blocks.md](assets/testing-delegation-blocks.md) for ATTACK delegation YAML

**Evaluate Response:**
- If no BLOCKERs → Continue to Phase 4
- If BLOCKERs found:
  - Return to Phase 2 with BLOCKER details
  - HyperArch fixes, then re-invoke HyperRed (max 2 attack cycles)

### 5. Phase 4: FINAL
Invoke HyperSan for final validation.
→ See [testing-delegation-blocks.md](assets/testing-delegation-blocks.md) for FINAL delegation YAML

**Evaluate Response:**
- If approved → Finalize
- If issues → Report, suggest remediation

### 6. Finalization
Compile comprehensive summary:
- Test plan overview
- Spec test results
- HyperRed findings and resolutions
- Final validation status

## Output Format

### Success
Template for successful test completion reports:
→ See [testing-success-template.md](assets/testing-success-template.md)

### Partial
Template for incomplete testing reports:
→ See [testing-partial-template.md](assets/testing-partial-template.md)

## Critical Rules
- **All Phases Mandatory**: Do not skip any phase
- **Max 3 Spec-Test Cycles**: Halt if tests won't pass after 3 cycles
- **Max 2 Attack Cycles**: Halt if HyperRed keeps finding BLOCKERs
- **Housekeeping Every 3 Cycles**: Invoke HyperIQGuard to prevent code rot
- **Severity Hierarchy**: BLOCKER must be fixed, WARNING should be fixed, INFO is optional
- **HyperRed Independence**: HyperRed generates its own attacks (does not use spec tests)
