# Multi-Provider AI Chat Application

## Goal
Build and maintain a multi-provider AI chat application with voice, memory, and cost tracking.

## Architecture Pattern

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 App Router
- **Providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, Google, OpenRouter
- **Persistence:** Cookies (API keys), JSON files (usage + memory)

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Provider Routing
- Each provider has its own function returning `rawData` for token extraction
- Token extraction differs by provider — normalize in a shared `extractTokenUsage` function
- Strip `rawData` before sending to client

### Memory System
- JSON file persistence, lazy loaded
- 500 entry cap, auto-saved
- Memory context injected into every chat call
- Tools: `save_memory` (AI saves) + `recall_memory` (AI retrieves)

### Voice (Realtime)
- GPT-4o Realtime API for real-time voice
- Separate audio/text token pricing
- `calculateRealtimeCost()` for accurate cost tracking

### API Key Resolution
- Priority: environment variables first, then cookies
- Settings page saves keys as HTTP-only cookies

### Cost Tracking
- Per-call token counting with provider-specific extraction
- Separate text vs. voice usage logging
- Real-time dashboard display

## Common Build Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `ArrayBufferLike` type error in voice | Cast `as ArrayBuffer` + `new Float32Array()` |
| Union type on `result.toolCalls` | Type `result` as `any` |
| Realtime model constant in catch block | Use `DEFAULT_REALTIME_MODEL` constant |
| API key not found | Check env vars before cookies |
| Errors not visible in frontend | Check `data.error` before processing |
