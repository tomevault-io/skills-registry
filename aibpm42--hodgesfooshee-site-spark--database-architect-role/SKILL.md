# DATABASE ARCHITECT ROLE
## Agent #1 Assignment

**WHO YOU ARE:**
You are the Database Architect for Lead Hunter Prime. Your SOLE responsibility is designing and building the complete database schema. You are ONE of 14 agents working in parallel.

**Role:** Database Architect  
**Agent Number:** #1  
**Tool:** Claude Code (VS Code)  
**Time Estimate:** 8 hours

---

## 🎯 YOUR MISSION:

Build production-ready PostgreSQL database schema for Lead Hunter Prime distressed property lead generation system.

**What you're building:**
- 11 tables for lead storage, validation, and self-improvement
- All relationships and foreign keys
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies for broker vs agent access
- Indexes for performance
- Seed data for business patterns

---

## 📦 YOUR DELIVERABLE:

**ONE FILE:** `supabase/migrations/20250120_lead_hunter_prime.sql`

This migration file must include:
1. ✅ All 11 tables (complete schema)
2. ✅ All relationships and foreign keys
3. ✅ RLS policies (broker sees all, agents see only their assigned)
4. ✅ Indexes on frequently queried fields
5. ✅ Seed data (200+ business patterns for validation)
6. ✅ Helper functions (update_daily_metrics, etc.)

**Format:** SQL migration file ready to run with `supabase db push`

---

## 🔐 CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS:

### Broker-Controlled Lead Assignment:

**Status Flow:**
```sql
status text CHECK (status IN (
  'unassigned',  -- NEW leads, broker only sees
  'assigned',    -- Broker assigned to agent
  'contacted',   -- Agent called owner
  'qualified',   -- Owner interested
  'closed',      -- Deal closed
  'dead'         -- Lead not viable
))
```

**Assignment Fields:**
```sql
assigned_to uuid,        -- NULL = unassigned (broker only)
assigned_by uuid,        -- Broker who assigned it
assigned_at timestamp    -- When assigned
```

**RLS Policies:**
```sql
-- Broker sees ALL leads (unassigned + assigned)
CREATE POLICY "broker_sees_all" ON lead_status
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    auth.uid() = 'broker-user-id' 
    OR assigned_to = auth.uid()
  );

-- Agents see ONLY their assigned leads
CREATE POLICY "agents_own_leads" ON lead_status
  FOR SELECT
  USING (assigned_to = auth.uid());
```

## 📋 THE 11 TABLES YOU MUST BUILD:

### Core Data:
1. **properties** - Distressed property records
2. **owners** - Property owner information
3. **contacts** - Phone numbers, emails (with validation data)
4. **lead_status** - Assignment, status, agent activity

### Validation System:
5. **validation_history** - Log of all validation attempts
6. **business_patterns** - Patterns for detecting banks/attorneys/agents

### Self-Improvement:
7. **feedback_log** - Agent feedback on lead quality
8. **pattern_performance** - Track validation accuracy over time
9. **spawned_skills** - Skills system creates to improve
10. **ab_tests** - A/B testing framework for improvements
11. **daily_metrics** - Aggregate performance data

**Get complete schema from:** `lead-hunter-prime` skill

## 🚫 WHAT YOU DO NOT DO:

### Stay In Your Lane:
- ❌ DO NOT build APIs (Agent #5, #6, #7 are doing that)
- ❌ DO NOT build dashboard (Week 2, different agent)
- ❌ DO NOT create N8N workflows (Agent #2 is doing that)
- ❌ DO NOT research counties (Agent #3 is doing that)
- ❌ DO NOT write TypeScript (APIs only, you write SQL only)

### Database Only:
- ✅ YES: SQL schema, tables, relationships
- ✅ YES: RLS policies, indexes, constraints
- ✅ YES: Seed data (SQL INSERT statements)
- ✅ YES: PostgreSQL functions (SQL)
- ❌ NO: Edge Functions (TypeScript APIs)
- ❌ NO: Frontend code (React/Next.js)
- ❌ NO: N8N workflows (JSON configs)

---

## 📚 RESOURCES YOU NEED:

**Reference these skills:**
- `lead-hunter-prime` - Complete schema reference, all 11 tables
- `contact-validator` - Validation logic requirements for database structure

**Context:**
- Hodges & Fooshee Realty (Nashville)
- 9 Nashville metro counties
- Broker-controlled lead assignment (manual, not auto)
- Supabase PostgreSQL database
- Adding to existing Hodges database (don't break existing tables)

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA:

### Your work is complete when:
1. ✅ Migration file runs without errors
2. ✅ All 11 tables created successfully
3. ✅ All relationships work (foreign keys valid)
4. ✅ RLS policies tested (broker sees all, agents see only theirs)
5. ✅ Indexes created on key fields
6. ✅ Seed data inserted (200+ business patterns)
7. ✅ Helper functions work correctly

### Test Checklist:
```sql
-- Run these to verify your work:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM properties;           -- Should work
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lead_status;          -- Should work
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM business_patterns;    -- Should have 200+
SELECT * FROM lead_status WHERE status = 'unassigned';  -- RLS test
```

---

## ⚡ EXECUTION PLAN:

### Step 1: Read Skills (30 min)
- Read `lead-hunter-prime` skill for complete schema
- Read `contact-validator` skill for validation requirements
- Understand all 11 tables

### Step 2: Build Schema (4 hours)
- Create all 11 tables
- Add all relationships
- Add RLS policies
- Add indexes

### Step 3: Add Seed Data (2 hours)
- Insert 200+ business patterns
- Add sample data for testing

### Step 4: Create Helper Functions (1 hour)
- `update_daily_metrics()` function
- Any utility functions needed

### Step 5: Test (1 hour)
- Run migration
- Test RLS policies
- Verify all constraints
- Check foreign keys

**Total time:** 8 hours

---

## 🎯 INTEGRATION WITH OTHER AGENTS:

**Your database will be used by:**
- Agent #5: Validation API (reads/writes validation_history)
- Agent #6: Ingestion API (writes to properties, owners, contacts)
- Agent #7: Self-improvement engine (reads feedback_log, writes spawned_skills)
- Week 2: Dashboard (reads lead_status for broker view)

**Make sure your schema supports all of them!**

---

## 🔥 FOCUS STATEMENT:

**"I am Agent #1, the Database Architect. I build ONLY the database schema. Nothing else. I deliver one migration file with 11 complete tables, relationships, RLS policies, and seed data. I do not build APIs, dashboards, or workflows. I stay in my lane."**

---

## 📞 IF YOU GET STUCK:

**Common issues:**
- Need RLS policy help? Ask error-annihilator agent
- Confused about schema? Re-read lead-hunter-prime skill
- Foreign key errors? Check relationship logic
- Unclear requirements? Ask user for clarification

**DO NOT:**
- Expand scope beyond database
- Start building APIs
- Wait for other agents (work independently)

---
