# Librarian - Documentation Prose Architect

Analyze the **prose content** of documentation - what it says, how it explains concepts, where ideas are scattered or
duplicated - to reorganize by semantic meaning, not just file structure.

## Core Philosophy

**The librarian examines PROSE, not just code.**

The librarian reads documentation like a human reader would, understanding:

1. **What each file explains** - The concepts, workflows, and ideas described in prose
2. **How explanations relate** - Where the same idea is explained differently in multiple places
3. **Where prose contradicts** - Conflicting explanations, not just conflicting numbers
4. **What's scattered vs. cohesive** - Ideas that belong together split across files
5. **What's mixed vs. focused** - Unrelated explanations crammed into one file

**This is NOT about:**

- Fixing broken links (that's a side effect)
- Checking operator consistency (that's mechanical)
- Enforcing line limits (that's a constraint)
- Validating code blocks (that's syntax)

**This IS about:**

- Understanding what each document is trying to explain
- Finding where explanations are incomplete, scattered, or contradictory
- Reorganizing prose so concepts flow logically
- Consolidating duplicate explanations into single authoritative sources

## What "Examining Prose" Means

When you read a documentation file, ask:

```
PROSE ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:
├── UNDERSTANDING:
│   ├── What concept is this file trying to explain?
│   ├── Who is the intended reader?
│   ├── What should the reader know after reading this?
│   └── What does this file ASSUME the reader already knows?
│
├── QUALITY:
│   ├── Is the explanation complete?
│   ├── Is the explanation clear?
│   ├── Are there gaps in the logic?
│   └── Would a reader be confused by anything?
│
├── RELATIONSHIPS:
│   ├── What other concepts does this explanation reference?
│   ├── Are those concepts explained here or elsewhere?
│   ├── If elsewhere, is the reference clear?
│   └── Does this explanation contradict any other?
│
└── ORGANIZATION:
    ├── Does this explanation belong in this file?
    ├── Is this file trying to explain too many things?
    ├── Is this explanation scattered across multiple files?
    └── Would reorganizing improve understanding?
```

### Prose Issues vs Mechanical Issues

| Prose Issues (Focus Here)                  | Mechanical Issues (Secondary) |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Same concept explained 3 different ways    | Broken markdown link          |
| Conflicting instructions for same scenario | Missing file reference        |
| Workflow explanation split across 5 files  | Line count over limit         |
| Tutorial mixed with reference material     | Inconsistent heading levels   |
| Incomplete explanation assumes too much    | Duplicate signal format       |
| Confusing explanation with unclear logic   | Wrong anchor tag              |

**Always prioritize prose issues.** Mechanical issues often fix themselves when prose is reorganized correctly.

## Parameters

| Parameter    | Required | Default        | Description                           |

## Phase 1: Semantic Analysis (READ THE PROSE)

### 1.1 Build Concept Map

Read ALL documentation files **as prose** and extract:

```
CONCEPT EXTRACTION:
├── For each file, READ IT and identify:
│   ├── Primary concept (what is this file fundamentally ABOUT?)
│   │   → Not "what's in the filename" but "what does it explain"
│   │
│   ├── Key explanations (what does it teach the reader?)
│   │   → Summarize each major section's purpose
│   │
│   ├── Audience assumptions (what does it assume you know?)
│   │   → What would confuse a new reader?
│   │
│   ├── Terminology defined (what terms does it establish?)
│   │   → Look for definitions, not just usage
│   │
│   └── Dependencies (what must you read first?)
│       → What concepts are referenced but not explained?
│
├── Build concept index:
│   ├── concept → [files that EXPLAIN it in prose]
│   ├── concept → [files that MENTION it without explaining]
│   └── concept → [files that ASSUME reader knows it]
│
└── Identify concept clusters:
    ├── Concepts that form a coherent topic (should be together)
    ├── Concepts that build on each other (should be ordered)
    └── Concepts that conflict (should be reconciled)
```

### 1.2 Map Explanation Patterns

Understand HOW concepts are explained:

```
EXPLANATION PATTERN ANALYSIS:
├── Explanation styles found:
│   ├── Tutorial (step-by-step, "do this then this")
│   ├── Reference (lookup, "X means Y")
│   ├── Conceptual (understanding, "why X matters")
│   └── Example-driven (showing, "here's X in action")
│
├── Mixed styles in same file (potential split):
│   ├── File tries to be both tutorial AND reference
│   ├── File mixes conceptual overview with implementation detail
│   └── File combines quick-start with exhaustive reference
│
├── Incomplete explanations:
│   ├── Concept mentioned but never fully explained
│   ├── Workflow described but steps are vague
│   ├── Term used but never defined
│   └── "See X" but X doesn't exist
│
└── Redundant explanations:
    ├── Same concept explained in multiple files
    ├── Same workflow described with different wording
    ├── Same template shown in multiple places
    └── Same rules stated in different contexts
```

### 1.3 Detect Prose Fragmentation

Find explanations that are SCATTERED when they should be TOGETHER:

```
FRAGMENTATION DETECTION:
├── Same concept explained partially in multiple files:
│   Example: "Expert delegation" explained 30% in expert-delegation.md,
│            20% in escalation-specification.md, 50% in agent-conduct.md
│   → Consolidate into single authoritative explanation
│
├── Workflow explanation split across files:
│   Example: Steps 1-3 in file A, steps 4-6 in file B, step 7 missing
│   → Reunify or clearly link the sequence
│
├── Definition separated from context:
│   Example: Signal format in signals.md, usage rules in workflows.md
│   → Either consolidate or create clear cross-references
│
├── Examples separated from concepts:
│   Example: Concept explained in chapter.md, examples in examples.md
│   → Consider reunifying unless examples are extensive
│
└── Prerequisites scattered:
    Example: "You need X" in file A, "X works like..." in file C
    → Reader can't follow without hunting through multiple files
```

### 1.4 Detect Prose Mixing

Find explanations that are TOGETHER when they should be SEPARATE:

```
MIXING DETECTION:
├── Multiple unrelated concepts in one file:
│   Example: File covers state management AND signal formats AND recovery
│   → These serve different readers at different times - separate them
│
├── Mixed audiences:
│   Example: Developer how-to mixed with orchestrator implementation details
│   → Developers don't need orchestrator details - separate them
│
├── Mixed depths:
│   Example: Quick-start overview mixed with exhaustive reference
│   → Reader wants one or the other - separate them
│
├── Mixed purposes:
│   Example: "What is X" (conceptual) mixed with "How to X" (tutorial)
│   → These serve different needs - consider separating
│
└── Mixed time contexts:
    Example: Setup (do once) mixed with runtime (do repeatedly)
    → Reader needs these at different times - separate them
```

---

## Phase 2: Consistency Analysis (CHECK THE PROSE)

### 2.1 Semantic Contradictions

Check for CONFLICTING EXPLANATIONS (not just conflicting numbers):

```
CONTRADICTION DETECTION:
├── Same concept explained differently:
│   Example: File A says "agents can delegate to experts"
│            File B says "agents must solve problems themselves"
│   → CRITICAL: Resolve which explanation is correct
│
├── Conflicting instructions:
│   Example: File A says "always signal before exiting"
│            File B says "exit immediately on failure"
│   → CRITICAL: Clarify when each applies
│
├── Conflicting definitions:
│   Example: File A defines "task" as single work item
│            File B uses "task" to mean entire workflow
│   → CRITICAL: Standardize terminology
│
├── Conflicting assumptions:
│   Example: File A assumes reader knows signals
│            File B assumes reader is learning signals
│   → These files serve different audiences - clarify or separate
│
└── Implicit contradictions:
    Example: File A implies X is always true
             File B describes a case where X is false
    → Make the exception explicit
```

### 2.2 Explanation Completeness

Check for GAPS in explanations:

```
GAP DETECTION:
├── Concepts referenced but never explained:
│   Example: "Use the signal format" - but what IS the signal format?
│   → Add explanation or clear reference
│
├── Workflows with missing steps:
│   Example: "1. Do X, 2. Do Y, 4. Do Z" - what's step 3?
│   → Complete the workflow
│
├── Assumptions stated but not justified:
│   Example: "Always use method A" - why? When is method B appropriate?
│   → Explain the reasoning
│
├── Edge cases ignored:
│   Example: "Process the input" - what if input is invalid?
│   → Address edge cases or state assumptions
│
└── Reader questions unanswered:
    Example: After reading, would a reader still wonder "but what about...?"
    → Anticipate and answer those questions
```

### 2.3 Referential Consistency

Check that references match reality:

```
REFERENTIAL CHECKS:
├── Link claims match content:
│   Example: Link says "see signal formats" but target explains workflows
│   → Fix the link or the description
│
├── Cross-references are bidirectional:
│   Example: A links to B, but B doesn't acknowledge A
│   → Add backlink if relationship is important
│
├── Hierarchies are consistent:
│   Example: Index claims file is about X, file is actually about Y
│   → Update index or clarify file's purpose
│
└── Navigation matches content organization:
    Example: Navigation implies reading order A→B→C but C should come first
    → Fix navigation to match logical flow
```

---

## Phase 3: Reorganization Planning (PLAN PROSE CHANGES)

### 3.1 Consolidation Planning

Plan where to MERGE scattered explanations:

```
CONSOLIDATION PLANNING:
├── For each fragmented concept:
│   ├── Which file should be the AUTHORITATIVE source?
│   │   → Usually the most complete/accurate version
│   │
│   ├── What content needs to MOVE there?
│   │   → List specific prose sections, not just "merge files"
│   │
│   ├── What should REMAIN in source files?
│   │   → Brief mention + reference, or nothing?
│   │
│   └── How will readers find it?
│       → Update navigation, add redirects
│
└── Consolidation output format:
    CONSOLIDATE: "Expert Delegation"
    FROM: expert-delegation.md (lines 50-120), escalation-spec.md (lines 30-45)
    TO: expert-delegation.md
    REASON: Concept explained twice with slight variations
    ACTION: Merge prose, pick clearer wording, reference from other file
```

### 3.2 Separation Planning

Plan where to SPLIT mixed content:

```
SEPARATION PLANNING:
├── For each mixed file:
│   ├── What DISTINCT explanations does it contain?
│   │   → List them as separate topics
│   │
│   ├── Can they stand alone?
│   │   → Each new file should make sense independently
│   │
│   ├── How should they be named?
│   │   → Names should reflect the explanation, not arbitrary sections
│   │
│   └── How will they link to each other?
│       → Cross-references for related concepts
│
└── Separation output format:
    SEPARATE: "state/task-tracking.md"
    INTO:
      - state/task-tracking.md: "Task selection and tracking" (lines 10-200)
      - state/updates.md: "When state changes" (lines 201-400)
      - state/recovery.md: "How to recover state" (lines 401-500)
    REASON: Three distinct topics serving different needs
    ACTION: Create focused files, add index, cross-reference
```

### 3.3 Movement Planning

Plan where to RELOCATE misplaced content:

```
MOVEMENT PLANNING:
├── Content in wrong file:
│   Example: Signal parsing details in workflow-overview.md
│   → Move to signals.md where it belongs conceptually
│
├── Content at wrong level:
│   Example: Implementation details in quick-start.md
│   → Move to detailed reference
│
├── Content for wrong audience:
│   Example: Orchestrator internals in developer-guide.md
│   → Move to orchestrator documentation
│
└── Movement output format:
    MOVE: "Signal parsing implementation"
    FROM: task-dispatch.md (lines 200-350)
    TO: communication-protocol.md
    REASON: Parsing details don't belong in dispatch workflow
    ACTION: Move prose, leave brief reference in source
```

### 3.4 Line Limit Compliance

AFTER semantic reorganization, check line limits:

```
LINE LIMIT ANALYSIS (Secondary to semantic concerns):
├── Files over limit AFTER semantic fixes:
│   ├── Is the content genuinely cohesive? → Exception may be justified
│   ├── Can it be split semantically? → Find natural boundaries in prose
│   └── Would splitting harm understanding? → Keep together if so
│
├── Line limits are a CONSTRAINT, not a GOAL:
│   ├── Never split mid-explanation to meet a limit
│   ├── Never refuse consolidation because result is large
│   ├── Semantic organization > line counts
│
└── Report files over limit with recommendations
```

---

## Phase 4: Refactoring Execution

### 4.1 Execution Order

Execute changes prioritizing semantic correctness:

```
EXECUTION SEQUENCE:
1. BUILD CHANGE MANIFEST (before any edits)
   - List all files to be modified
   - Track all paths/anchors that will change
   - This enables reference integrity checking later

2. RESOLVE CONTRADICTIONS (highest priority)
   - Determine correct explanation
   - Update conflicting files to align
   - Document the resolution

3. CONSOLIDATE SCATTERED EXPLANATIONS
   - Merge prose into authoritative source
   - Replace duplicates with references
   - Preserve all unique information

4. SEPARATE MIXED CONTENT
   - Create focused files for distinct topics
   - Move prose to appropriate locations
   - Add navigation and cross-references

5. MOVE MISPLACED CONTENT
   - Relocate prose to correct conceptual homes
   - Update source to reference new location
   - Fix navigation paths

6. ADDRESS SIZE (only if needed after above)
   - Semantic splits only
   - Never split mid-explanation
   - Create navigation for split content

7. REFERENCE INTEGRITY (MANDATORY - See Phase 5)
   - Scan ENTIRE project for references to changed files
   - Update ALL broken references
   - Verify zero orphaned references remain
   - THIS STEP IS NOT OPTIONAL

8. VERIFY CONSISTENCY
   - Re-check for contradictions
   - Confirm explanations are complete
   - Validate all links work
```

### 4.2 Prose Preservation Rules

When moving/merging explanations:

```
PRESERVATION RULES:
├── NEVER lose explanations - all prose must survive reorganization
├── NEVER change meaning - preserve explanatory intent
├── PREFER clearer wording when merging duplicate explanations
├── PRESERVE examples that illustrate concepts
├── ADD context when moving content to new location
├── UPDATE references so readers can find moved content
└── DOCUMENT changes - what moved where and why
```

### 4.3 Navigation Maintenance

Ensure readers can find reorganized content:

```
NAVIGATION RULES:
├── Every explanation reachable within 1 level from entry points
├── Index files summarize what each file EXPLAINS
├── Related explanations linked bidirectionally
├── Clear reading paths for different audiences
├── No dead ends (every file leads somewhere)
└── Moved content findable from old locations (redirects or references)
```

---

## Phase 5: Reference Integrity (MANDATORY)

**This phase is NOT optional.** Every librarian run that modifies files MUST complete this phase before finishing.

### 5.1 Build Change Manifest

Before any edits, track what will change:

```
CHANGE MANIFEST (build before editing):
├── Files to be modified:
│   ├── {file_path}: {what changes}
│   └── ...
│
├── Files to be moved/renamed:
│   ├── {old_path} → {new_path}
│   └── ...
│
├── Anchors to be changed:
│   ├── {file}#{old_anchor} → {file}#{new_anchor}
│   └── ...
│
└── Content relocated:
    ├── "{concept}" from {source} to {target}
    └── ...
```

### 5.2 Execute Reference Scan

After ALL edits are complete, scan the ENTIRE project for references:

```bash
# Scan all markdown files in project for references to modified files
# For each file in CHANGE MANIFEST:

grep -r "old_filename\.md" .claude/ --include="*.md"
grep -r "old_anchor" .claude/ --include="*.md"
```

**Scan locations (MANDATORY - do not skip any):**
- `.claude/docs/` - All documentation
- `.claude/experts/` - Generated expert agent files
- `.claude/skills/` - Skill definitions
- `.claude/commands/` - Command definitions
- `.claude/prompts/` - Prompt templates
- `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` - Root documentation
- Any other `.md` files in the project

### 5.3 Update All References

For each broken reference found:

```
REFERENCE UPDATE PROCEDURE:
1. Read the file containing the broken reference
2. Identify the reference context (what is it linking to?)
3. Update to new location/anchor
4. Verify the new reference is valid
5. Save the file
```

**Reference patterns to check:**
- `[text](path/to/file.md)` - Markdown links
- `[text](path/to/file.md#anchor)` - Anchored links
- `See [document](path)` - Inline references
- `**Reference**: [Name](path)` - Formal references
- `path/to/file.md` - Plain path mentions

### 5.4 Verify Reference Integrity

After updating all references, VERIFY nothing is broken:

```
VERIFICATION PROCEDURE:

1. RE-SCAN for old paths/anchors
   - grep -r "{old_path}" .claude/ --include="*.md"
   - Result MUST be empty (zero matches)

2. VALIDATE new references exist
   - For each updated reference, confirm target file exists
   - For anchored links, confirm anchor exists in target

3. CHECK for orphaned files
   - Files that were sources of moved content
   - Ensure they either redirect or are deleted

4. REPORT results
   - List all references updated
   - Confirm zero broken references remain
```

### 5.5 Reference Integrity Output

Include in final report:

```
REFERENCE INTEGRITY CHECK
=========================

Change Manifest:
- {N} files modified
- {N} files moved/renamed
- {N} anchors changed

References Updated: {count}

---

## Concept Affinity Rules

When deciding what explanations belong together:

### High Affinity (same file)

- Concept definition and its examples
- Workflow overview and its steps
- Rule and its exceptions
- Format specification and its usage

### Medium Affinity (same directory, linked)

- Overview and detailed reference
- Tutorial and troubleshooting
- Concept and related concepts

### Low Affinity (separate, cross-linked)

- Different roles' documentation
- Different phases of a process
- Conceptual vs implementation

---

## Quality Checks

### Before Refactoring

- [ ] All contradicting explanations identified
- [ ] Consolidation preserves all unique information
- [ ] Separations create coherent standalone topics
- [ ] Movements improve conceptual organization
- [ ] **Change manifest built** (list of all files/paths/anchors to change)

### After Refactoring

- [ ] No contradictions remain
- [ ] Each concept explained in ONE place authoritatively
- [ ] Related concepts linked
- [ ] Readers can find what they need
- [ ] All prose preserved

### Reference Integrity (MANDATORY)

- [ ] **All project locations scanned** for references to changed files
- [ ] **All broken references updated** to new locations
- [ ] **Zero orphaned references** confirmed via re-scan
- [ ] **Verification report included** in output

**The librarian run is NOT complete until reference integrity is verified.**

## Error Handling

| Issue                                             | Action                          |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Contradictions can't be resolved from prose alone | Flag for human decision         |
| Explanation doesn't fit anywhere cleanly          | Create new topic category       |
| Consolidation would create huge file              | Accept if cohesive, flag if not |
| Separation would fragment explanation             | Keep together                   |

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement            | Purpose                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Read access to `path`  | Read and understand documentation prose  |
| Write access to `path` | Reorganize files (refactor mode)         |
| Task tool              | Parallel analysis agents to read files   |
| Understanding          | Actually READ the prose, don't just scan |
