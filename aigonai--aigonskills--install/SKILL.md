# Install aigonskills MCP Server

Register the aigonskills MCP server so skill discovery tools become available. No API key required.

**Server endpoint:** `https://aigonskills.aigon.ai/sse` (SSE transport)

## Method 1: Claude Code CLI

1. Check if the server is already configured:
   ```
   claude mcp list
   ```
   If `aigonskills` already appears, tell the user it's already installed and stop.

2. Install the server:
   ```
   claude mcp add --transport sse aigonskills https://aigonskills.aigon.ai/sse
   ```

3. Verify with `claude mcp list` or the `/mcp` command inside Claude Code.

4. **Restart Claude Code** (or start a new session) for the MCP tools to become available.

To remove: `claude mcp remove aigonskills`

## Method 2: Configuration file (manual)

Claude Code stores MCP server config in `.claude/settings.local.json` (project-level) or `~/.claude/settings.json` (global). Add the server entry manually if preferred:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aigonskills": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://aigonskills.aigon.ai/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## Method 3: Claude Desktop (mcp-remote)

Claude Desktop does not support SSE transport natively. Use `mcp-remote` to bridge the connection.

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aigonskills": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://aigonskills.aigon.ai/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

This spawns a local process via `npx mcp-remote` that proxies the remote SSE server as a local stdio MCP server that Claude Desktop can talk to. Requires Node.js/npm installed.

## Method 4: Cursor

Go to Cursor settings → MCP → Add new server. Set type to `sse` and URL to `https://aigonskills.aigon.ai/sse`.

## Method 5: Programmatic (Python)

```python
from mcp import ClientSession
from mcp.client.sse import sse_client

async with sse_client("https://aigonskills.aigon.ai/sse") as (read, write):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        result = await session.call_tool("call", {
            "namespace": "aigonskills",
            "function": "stats",
        })
        print(result.content[0].text)
```

## Verify it works

After restarting Claude Code, run `/mcp` and confirm `aigonskills` shows as connected. If it does, the MCP tools are available and ready to use.

Once installed, see the `asexplore` skill to search and discover skills, and the `use` skill to read and access them.

## Install the as* management skills

For optimal use of the aigonskills server, install the `as*` skill set as local slash commands. These are available in the aigonskills index — search for source `skloesch/aigonskills`:

```
call(namespace="aigonskills", function="list", kwargs={"query": "as", "source": "skloesch/aigonskills"})
```

Then install each one via `asinstall` (or manually download and place in `~/.claude/skills/`):

- `/asexplore` — search and discover skills
- `/asadd` — add a skill reference to CLAUDE.md/AGENT.md
- `/asremove` — remove a skill reference
- `/asrun` — run a referenced skill from remote
- `/asinstall` — install a skill locally as a slash command
- `/asuninstall` — remove a locally installed skill

These give you a complete workflow: explore → add/install → run → remove/uninstall.
