# AI Visual Accuracy Check Skill

## Purpose

This is a **BLOCKING quality gate** that uses **AI to validate visual accuracy** of generated HTML against the original PDF page. Unlike pixel-perfect comparison, AI understands:

- Visual hierarchy and layout intent
- Contextual differences (web rendering vs PDF)
- Whether readers would have similar experience
- Trade-offs between CSS limitations and HTML accuracy

The AI provides:
- Objective similarity score (0-100%)
- Breakdown by evaluation criteria
- Specific differences noted
- Clear pass/fail recommendation
- Explanation for decisions

This combines **AI's contextual understanding** with **deterministic gating** (must pass 85+ to continue).

## What to Do

1. **Load input files**
   - Read `chapter_XX.html` (generated consolidated HTML)
   - Read `02_page_XX.png` (original PDF page image)

2. **Render HTML to image**
   - Use headless browser (Playwright/Selenium) to render HTML as PNG
   - Capture full page screenshot
   - Save rendered image for comparison

3. **Invoke Claude with visual comparison**
   - Attach original PDF PNG as image 1
   - Attach rendered HTML screenshot as image 2
   - Request detailed visual comparison
   - Ask AI to score on multiple criteria

4. **Parse AI response**
   - Extract overall similarity score
   - Extract criterion-specific scores
   - Parse differences noted
   - Get recommendation (PASS/FAIL)

5. **Save comparison report**
   - Save to: `output/chapter_XX/chapter_artifacts/ai_visual_accuracy.json`
   - Include timestamp, inputs used, AI model

6. **Make gate decision**
   - If score ≥ 85: PASS (exit code 0, continue)
   - If score < 85: FAIL (exit code 1, trigger hook)

## Input Parameters

```
html_file: <str>          - Path to chapter_XX.html
pdf_page_png: <str>       - Path to original PDF page PNG (or multiple for multi-page)
output_dir: <str>         - Directory for report
chapter: <int>            - Chapter number (for reporting)
book_pages: <str>         - Page range (for reporting)
threshold: <float>        - Minimum score to pass (default: 85.0)
```

## AI Prompt Template

```
You are validating the visual accuracy of a generated HTML page against the original PDF.

ORIGINAL PDF PAGE:
[PNG Image of original PDF page attached]

GENERATED HTML (Rendered):
[PNG Image of rendered HTML page attached]

TASK:
Compare these two images and determine if the HTML accurately recreates the visual appearance and layout of the PDF page.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Layout Match (40% weight)
   - Overall page structure matches original
   - Sections in correct order and position
   - Spacing between elements appropriate
   - Page dimensions/aspect ratio similar

2. Visual Hierarchy (30% weight)
   - Headings stand out with appropriate prominence
   - Section breaks clearly visible
   - Emphasis (bold, italic) preserved or equivalent
   - Visual relationships between elements clear

3. Content Positioning (20% weight)
   - Elements aligned correctly (left, center, right)
   - Lists indented with proper spacing
   - Tables/exhibits positioned and aligned correctly
   - Paragraph flow matches original

4. Typography & Styling (10% weight)
   - Font sizes relative to each other correct
   - Text styling appropriate (bold, italic, caps)
   - Color scheme preserved (if applicable)
   - Overall readability equivalent or better

SCORING GUIDELINES:

For each criterion:
- 90-100%: Excellent, no issues
- 80-89%: Good, minor cosmetic differences
- 70-79%: Acceptable, noticeable but not critical
- Below 70%: Poor, significant differences

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- HTML rendering in browser may differ slightly from PDF (spacing, fonts)
- Focus on INTENT and READABILITY, not pixel-perfect match
- Small spacing/margin differences (2-5px) are acceptable
- Font rendering differences are acceptable if hierarchy preserved
- Web rendering constraints are acceptable (no absolute PDF positioning)

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide your analysis in this exact JSON format:

```json
{
  "overall_score": 92.5,
  "threshold": 85.0,
  "recommendation": "PASS",
  "criteria_analysis": {
    "layout_match": {

## Multi-Page Chapters

For chapters spanning multiple pages:

1. **Option A: Compare key pages**
   - Compare opening page (establishes style)
   - Compare middle pages (continuation pages)
   - Compare final pages (consistency check)
   - Average scores across pages

2. **Option B: Compare consolidated view**
   - Render full consolidated chapter
   - Compare overall structure
   - Spot-check specific pages visually

**Approach**: Use Option A for thorough validation
- Score each page separately (0-100)
- Average to get overall score
- Report per-page breakdown

## Gate Decision Threshold

```
Score ≥ 85:  PASS  → Continue to deployment
Score < 85:  FAIL  → Trigger hook, block pipeline

Interpretation:
  90-100: Excellent, no concerns
  85-89:  Good, minor cosmetic differences acceptable
  < 85:   Requires review and likely fixes
```

## Error Handling

**If HTML rendering fails**:
- Log error with details
- Try alternative rendering method
- Escalate if both fail

**If AI response is invalid JSON**:
- Request retry
- Fall back to text parsing if needed
- Escalate if repeated failures

**If score seems wrong (too high/low)**:
- AI's judgment takes precedence
- Trust AI's contextual understanding
- Log for future analysis

**If original PNG is missing**:
- Use reference page from PDF directly
- Or extract from PDF again
- Proceed with best available image

## Quality Checks

Before saving report:

1. **Score validity**
   - [ ] Overall score 0-100
   - [ ] All criteria scores 0-100
   - [ ] Scores reasonable and justified

2. **Report completeness**
   - [ ] All criteria included
   - [ ] Differences documented
   - [ ] Explanation provided
   - [ ] Recommendation clear

3. **AI reasoning**
   - [ ] Explanation matches score
   - [ ] Differences explain score deductions
   - [ ] Confidence level appropriate

## Success Criteria

✓ Visual accuracy report generated successfully
✓ Overall score calculated and justified
✓ All criteria scored and explained
✓ Differences clearly documented
✓ Pass/fail decision clear
✓ Exit code 0 if PASS, 1 if FAIL
✓ Report saved in JSON format

## Next Steps After PASS

If validation passes (score ≥ 85):
1. Gate decision: PASS
2. Continue to deployment approval
3. Chapter ready for production

## Next Steps After FAIL

If validation fails (score < 85):
1. **PIPELINE STOPS**
2. Hook `calypso-visual-accuracy.sh` triggered
3. User receives report with visual comparison details
4. Options:
   - Review differences and re-generate
   - Adjust CSS styling
   - Lower threshold if differences acceptable
   - Manual override if justified

## Design Notes

- This skill is **AI-powered** (probabilistic)
- Uses **visual reasoning** (not pixel-diff)
- Makes **contextual judgments** (understands intent)
- Provides **explainable decisions** (clear reasoning)
- Acts as **BLOCKING gate** (score must pass threshold)
- Part of **quality assurance** (ensures visual accuracy)

## Testing

To test AI visual accuracy:

```bash
# Generate chapter HTML (previous steps)
# Render to PNG
# Compare with original PDF

# Expected behavior:
# - AI compares images
# - Scores layout, hierarchy, positioning, typography
# - Generates report with score and explanation
# - Returns PASS (score ≥ 85) or FAIL (score < 85)
```

## Key Advantage Over Python Pixel-Diff

| Aspect | Python Pixel-Diff | AI Visual Comparison |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Understanding** | Detects changes | Understands intent |
| **Flexibility** | Exact match required | Accepts valid variations |
| **Explanation** | Pixel coordinates | Semantic feedback |
| **Tolerance** | Binary (match/no match) | Graduated (85%+ acceptable) |
| **Context** | No context | Full visual context |
| **Human-like** | No | Yes, like QA reviewer |

AI visual accuracy validation is **smarter and more human-like** than pixel-perfect comparison.
