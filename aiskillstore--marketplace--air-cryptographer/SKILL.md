# AIR Cryptographer Expertise

Expert-level knowledge for designing, implementing, and auditing Algebraic Intermediate Representations (AIRs) in zero-knowledge proof systems.

## Core Mindset

**Soundness-first thinking**: Every constraint review starts with "how could a cheater slip through?" Think adversarially. Construct counterexample traces by hand. Exploit polynomial identity loopholes.

**Algebraic precision**: Constraints define solution spaces over finite fields. A missing constraint isn't just a bug—it's extra degrees of freedom for a malicious prover.

## Finite Field Foundations

Essential intuitions:

- **Characteristics and inverses**: Every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. No zero divisors.
- **Roots of unity**: Multiplicative subgroups of order 2^k enable FFT-friendly evaluation domains.
- **Extension fields**: When you need more algebraic structure (e.g., M31 → QM31 for Stwo).
- **Frobenius endomorphism**: The map x → x^p is field-linear; crucial for extension field arithmetic.

## Polynomial Mechanics

**Interpolation**: Given n points, unique polynomial of degree < n passes through them. Lagrange basis makes this explicit.

**Vanishing polynomials**: Z_H(x) = ∏(x - h) for h ∈ H vanishes exactly on domain H. This is the foundation of constraint enforcement.

**Degree behavior**:

- Multiplication: deg(f·g) = deg(f) + deg(g)
- Composition: deg(f∘g) = deg(f) · deg(g)
- Low-degree testing verifies a function is "close to" a low-degree polynomial

**Evaluation domains**: Multiplicative cosets for separation. Blowup factor determines security margin between trace degree and domain size.

## Trace Design Principles

### Column Classification

| Type                | Definition                   | Example                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Source of truth** | Canonical witness data       | PC, registers, memory values |
| **Derived**         | Computed from source columns | Flags, decompositions        |
| **Auxiliary**       | Added to reduce degree       | Intermediate products        |

**Critical rule**: Every column must be constrained. An unconstrained column is a free variable for the prover.

### Row Semantics

Define precisely what each row represents:

- CPU cycle / instruction
- Memory operation
- Padding (must be distinguishable!)

Row types require selectors. Selectors must be:

- Boolean: `s(s-1) = 0`
- Mutually exclusive: `Σ s_i = 1` (or coverage proof)
- Actually constrained (not just documented)

### Minimal vs Redundant Columns

Start minimal. Add auxiliary columns only when:

- Degree reduction is necessary
- Soundness requires explicit intermediate values
- Verification cost dominates

## Constraint Categories

### Transition Constraints (Local)

Express correct step relation between row i and row i+1:

```text
next_pc = pc + instruction_size  (when not branching)
next_register[k] = f(current_state, opcode)
```

**Danger**: Writing a relation instead of a function. Multiple valid next-states = unsound.

### Boundary Constraints

Pin specific rows to specific values:

- **Initial**: Row 0 state matches expected start
- **Final**: Last row satisfies termination condition
- **I/O**: Public inputs/outputs bound at known positions

**Danger**: "Final row" must be uniquely defined. Variable-length traces need explicit halt handling.

### Booleanity and Range Constraints

For boolean b: `b(b-1) = 0`

For k-bit value x with bits b*0...b*{k-1}:

```text
x = Σ b_i · 2^i
b_i(b_i - 1) = 0  for all i
```

**Danger**: Forgetting booleanity constraints on decomposition bits.

### Selector Discipline

Selectors gate which constraints apply to which rows.

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Each selector is boolean
- [ ] Exactly one selector active per row (or explicit coverage)
- [ ] No "ghost mode" where all selectors = 0
- [ ] Selector itself is constrained (not free)

**Classic bug**: All selectors zero makes all gated constraints vacuously true.

## Global Consistency Arguments

### Permutation / Multiset Equality

Prove two multisets are equal via grand product:

```text
∏(α - a_i) = ∏(α - b_i)
```

**Checklist**:

- Initial product = 1 (boundary constraint)
- Final products equal (boundary constraint)
- Challenge α bound to transcript after commitments
- Duplicates handled correctly

**Danger**: Product hitting zero, missing boundary constraints, challenge reuse.

### Lookup Arguments

Prove all values in column A appear in table T.

**Checklist**:

- Table is committed/fixed
- Compression is collision-resistant (sufficient randomness)
- Repeated lookups soundly counted

**Danger**: Weak compression allows out-of-table values.

### Memory Consistency

Memory operations form a log: (address, timestamp, value, is_write)

**Patterns**:

- Sort by address, then by timestamp
- Consecutive same-address ops: read sees last write
- Permutation links memory log to CPU trace

**Danger**:

- Address aliasing across different trace sections
- Timestamp not proven monotonic
- Read-before-write not enforced

## Quotient and Composition

Constraint polynomial C(x) should vanish on trace domain H.

Quotient: `Q(x) = C(x) / Z_H(x)`

If C doesn't vanish on H, Q has poles → not low-degree → FRI rejects.

### Row-Set Control

Constraints apply to different row sets:

- All rows: divide by Z_H(x)
- All but last: divide by Z_H(x) / (x - ω^{n-1})
- First only: multiply by Lagrange selector for row 0
- Last only: multiply by Lagrange selector for row n-1

**Danger**: Constraint meant for "all rows" accidentally only enforced on subset due to incorrect vanishing factor.

### Degree Accounting

Track degree of every constraint:

```text
Base constraint degree: d
After selector multiplication: d + deg(selector)
After boundary polynomial: d + deg(boundary)
```

Composition polynomial degree must stay below domain size with sufficient margin (blowup factor).

## Fiat-Shamir Hygiene

**Transcript must bind**:

- All commitments (trace, lookup tables, etc.)
- Public inputs
- Trace length / domain parameters
- Any prover messages

**Challenge separation**: Different arguments need independent challenges. Reusing challenges creates algebraic vulnerabilities.

**Danger**: Challenge derived before commitment → prover can adapt witness.

## Adversarial Witness Exercises

Before declaring an AIR sound, try to break it:

1. **All selectors = 0**: Do constraints still enforce anything?
2. **Corrupt one column**: Can it drift without detection?
3. **Attack last row**: Dump inconsistency into wrap-around?
4. **Duplicate/omit memory events**: Does global check catch it?
5. **Force product to zero**: Exploit grand product boundary?
6. **Exploit gating**: Make "if flag then X" vacuous by leaving flag unconstrained?

If you find a counterexample trace, you found a bug.

## Common Vulnerability Patterns

| Pattern              | Symptom                    | Fix                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Unconstrained column | Prover sets arbitrarily    | Add constraint                     |
| Missing booleanity   | Non-binary "boolean"       | Add b(b-1)=0                       |
| Selector leakage     | Constraint bypassed        | Enforce exclusivity                |
| Last row escape      | Inconsistency hidden       | Proper terminal constraints        |
| Product zero         | Permutation argument fails | Boundary checks, domain separation |
| Challenge reuse      | Algebraic cancellation     | Separate challenges per argument   |
| Weak compression     | Lookup collision           | Increase randomness                |

## Performance-Aware Design

Understand tradeoffs without being an engineer:

| Choice            | Prover Cost          | Verifier Cost | Soundness    |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| More columns      | Higher memory        | Unchanged     | Neutral      |
| Higher degree     | More FRI rounds      | More queries  | Watch blowup |
| More rows         | Linear scaling       | Log scaling   | Neutral      |
| Auxiliary columns | Memory + constraints | Unchanged     | Can improve  |

**Rules of thumb**:

- Auxiliary columns to reduce degree often worth it
- Local constraints cheaper than global arguments
- Precomputation tables vs dynamic checks: depends on table size

## Review Deliverables

When reviewing an AIR, produce:

1. **Column inventory**: Name, meaning, range, where constrained
2. **Constraint map**: Each semantic claim → which constraint enforces it
3. **Degree table**: Every constraint's degree contribution
4. **Adversarial tests**: Attempted counterexamples
5. **Risk ranking**: Critical / High / Medium findings
6. **Proposed fixes**: Concrete constraint additions/modifications
