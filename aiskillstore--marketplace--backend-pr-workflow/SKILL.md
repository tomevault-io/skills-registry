# Backend PR Workflow Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Use this Skill whenever you are:

- Creating or reviewing a backend PR that touches Django models, migrations, or
  production data.
- Preparing a PR for Django4Lyfe / Workforce backend or a similar repo that
  uses ClickUp as the primary ticket system.
- Planning a release or hotfix and want to ensure the workflow (branches, tags,
  and migrations) is correct and downtime-safe.

If local `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` in the target repo conflict with anything
here, **treat those files as the source of truth** and use this Skill as the
default baseline.

## Example Prompts

- “Use the `backend-pr-workflow` skill to review this Django4Lyfe PR’s branch name, ClickUp linkage, migrations, and downtime-safety. Here are the branch name, base branch, and PR title: …”
- “Before I open this backend PR, run `backend-pr-workflow` on my planned title, description, and migration summary and tell me all `[BLOCKING]` and `[SHOULD_FIX]` issues.”
- “For this hotfix PR on Django4Lyfe, use `backend-pr-workflow` to check that my base branch, title, and release plan follow our backend workflow.”
- “I’ve added a new nullable field and a backfill migration. Use `backend-pr-workflow` to verify that my migrations and rollout plan are downtime-safe.”

## Severity Tags & Output Shape

When this Skill reviews a PR or workflow plan, the response **must** be
structured and tagged:

- Start with a 1–3 sentence summary of what was checked.
- Then use sections:
  - `What’s aligned` – bullets of things that follow the workflow.
  - `Needs changes` – bullets with severity tags:
    - `[BLOCKING]` – must fix before merge or deploy.
    - `[SHOULD_FIX]` – important but not strictly blocking for merge.
    - `[NIT]` – minor consistency or documentation suggestions.

Each bullet in `Needs changes` should:

- Point to the specific item (branch name, PR title, description, migration
  file, release plan).
- State the problem **and** the concrete correction the author should make.

Example bullet:

- `[BLOCKING] Branch name 'feature/my-thing' does not follow the required 'clickup_<ticket_id>' convention, and CI may not run. Rename to something like 'clickup_GH-1234_my-thing'.`

## Inputs This Skill Expects

Before giving a full review, this Skill should gather:

- The **repository** and context (e.g. Django4Lyfe backend / monolith).
- The **branch name**.
- The **PR title** and **PR description** (or the planned ones).
- The **base branch** (what the PR targets: `release`, `master`, etc.).
- Whether the PR:
  - Includes Django model changes.
  - Adds, modifies, or deletes migrations.
  - Is a normal feature/bugfix, a hotfix, or a release PR.

If any of these are missing or unclear, ask the user to provide them before
doing a full workflow review.

## Checklist 1 – ClickUp & Branch / PR Naming

This Skill treats **ClickUp linkage as non-negotiable**.

### 1.1 Branch name

Check the branch name:

- It **must** start with `clickup_<custom_ticket_id>`:
  - Examples:
    - `clickup_GH-785`
    - `clickup_GH-785_world_domination`
- The ticket ID **must** be the ClickUp **custom ticket ID** (e.g. `GH-785`),
  not the numeric internal ID.
- Rationale:
  - CI (e.g. CircleCI) is configured to run only for branches starting with
    `clickup_`.
  - ClickUp uses the custom ticket ID to automatically link branches, PRs, and
    commits to tickets.

If the branch does not follow this pattern, emit:

- `[BLOCKING]` – with a suggested corrected branch name.

### 1.2 Multi-repo work and sub-tickets

When a feature spans multiple repositories, enforce:

- Do **not** reuse the same ClickUp ID across multiple repos.
- Instead, require:
  - One **parent** ClickUp ticket for the overall feature.
  - Separate **sub-tickets** per repo:
    - Backend: `GH-2961`
    - Frontend: `GH-2962`
    - Data Science: `GH-2963`
    - Infra: `GH-2964`
- Each sub-ticket gets its own branch, PR, and commit series, following the
  same naming rules.

Explain risks of reusing the same ID across repos:

- Automation may update status prematurely or incorrectly.
- PRs from different repos can be linked to the wrong task.
- Ownership and progress become ambiguous.

If the user appears to be reusing the same ID across repos, emit:

- `[SHOULD_FIX]` – recommending sub-tickets and distinct branch/PR naming.

### 1.3 Commit messages

Check or remind the user that:

- **All commits** for the PR should start with the ticket ID:
  - `GH-785: Find another meaning of life`
- This is often enforced by `commit_msg_hook.py` and pre-commit hooks, but the
  Skill should still call out obvious violations.

If commit messages clearly lack ticket IDs (based on user input), emit:

- `[SHOULD_FIX]` – asking the author to fix future commits and, where
  practical, to rewrite recent history before merge.

### 1.4 PR title

The PR title must:

- Begin with `[<clickup_ticket_id>]`.
  - Example: `[GH-785] Found meaning of life`

If not, emit:

- `[BLOCKING]` – and propose a corrected title that includes the ticket ID.

Remind the user that:

- Correct titles allow ClickUp to auto-link the PR and expose PR status,
  reviewers, and activity directly in the ticket.

## Checklist 2 – WIP Signalling & Base Branch

### 2.1 WIP / draft status

Check whether the work is still in progress:

- If the author indicates the PR is not ready for review yet:
  - The PR should be in **draft** mode, or
  - The title or label should clearly include `WIP` / `[WIP]`.

If not, emit:

- `[SHOULD_FIX]` – asking the author to convert to draft or annotate the PR as
  WIP to avoid premature review.

### 2.2 Base branch selection

Confirm the base branch matches the project’s release workflow:

- **Normal feature / bugfix work**:
  - Base branch should be `release` (for repos following the Django4Lyfe
    pattern).
- **Hotfix** that must bypass the current `release` contents:
  - Base branch should be `master`.

If a PR targets the wrong base branch:

- Emit `[BLOCKING]` and recommend the correct base, explaining whether the
  change belongs in `release` or should be a `master` hotfix.

If the repo’s docs specify a different default (e.g. custom long-lived branches
documented in `CLAUDE.md`), follow that instead.

## Checklist 3 – PR Description & Self-Review

This Skill expects PR authors to be their own first reviewer.

### 3.1 PR description quality

Check that the description (or planned description):

- Follows any existing PR template for the repo, if one exists.
- Clearly explains:
  - What changed.
  - Why it changed (the problem or goal).
  - Whether there are any **breaking changes** and what reviewers should
    inspect carefully.
  - Any required secrets, DB dumps, or setup information, with guidance to
    share secrets via 1Password / Slack and to clean up messages.
  - Any manual steps needed for deploy:
    - Env vars to add/update.
    - Buckets or external resources to create.
    - Management commands or scripts to run.
    - Whether a DB snapshot is recommended before deploy (for heavy data
      changes).

If key context is missing, emit:

- `[SHOULD_FIX]` – listing the missing items and suggesting how to include
  them.

### 3.2 Self-review checklist

Prompt the author to confirm they have checked:

- Branch is up to date with the base branch; diff is not polluted by unrelated
  files.
- All debugging code is removed:
  - No `print()` / `ipdb` / `pdb` left behind.
- Tests have been added or updated for new functionality.
- Tests are passing in CI.
- Pre-commit hooks and coding conventions have been applied.
- Code coverage has not regressed significantly.
- For Django changes: migrations have been cleaned up and regenerated if there
  were multiple schema iterations.

If any of these fail obviously based on the PR description or user input, emit
appropriate `[SHOULD_FIX]` or `[BLOCKING]` bullets.

## Checklist 4 – Releases, Hotfixes, and Tags

This Skill enforces a clean release flow.

### 4.1 Normal release flow (via `release` branch)

For normal deployments, check that:

- Feature/bugfix PRs merge into `release`.
- Before cutting a release:
  - The version (e.g. in `pyproject.toml`) is bumped to the intended release
    version, using CalVer (e.g. `2025-08-19`).
  - If direct pushes to `release` are not allowed, a small PR is created to
    bump the version on `release`.
- When ready to deploy:
  - A PR is created from `release` → `master` with a title like:
    - `Release: 2025-08-19`
    - `Release 2: 2025-08-19` (for multiple releases in one day).
  - The release PR **lists all tickets / PRs included** in the description.

Post-deployment:

- A GitHub Release is created targeting `master`.
- Tag name uses date-based versioning (CalVer):
  - `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD-2`.

If any of these are obviously missing from the plan, emit `[SHOULD_FIX]`.

### 4.2 Hotfix flow

For hotfixes, enforce:

- The hotfix PR targets `master` (not `release`).
- The title clearly indicates a hotfix, e.g.:
  - `Hotfix release: 2025-08-19`
- After deployment:
  - Changes are merged back into `release` so it stays ahead of or equal to
    `master`.
  - A GitHub Release is created and tagged using the same CalVer scheme.

If a supposed hotfix PR is targeting `release`, or a hotfix is not planned to
be merged back into `release`, emit `[BLOCKING]`.

## Checklist 5 – Migrations: Cleanup and Regeneration

When the PR includes Django model changes, this Skill should be pedantic about
migrations.

### 5.1 Avoid noisy chains of migrations from one PR

If the PR has multiple intermediate migrations for the same feature
(`...x1.py`, `...x2.py`, `...x3.py`, etc.), recommend cleaning them up before
merge:

- Identify which migrations were added by this PR vs. which already exist on
  the main branches.
- Conceptual cleanup workflow:
  - Migrate back to the migration **just before** the first PR-specific
    migration.
  - Delete **only** the migrations introduced by this PR.
  - Regenerate a minimal set of migrations representing the final schema.
  - Apply the new migrations locally and ensure tests pass.

Never recommend deleting migrations that are already on production.

If the PR clearly contains many iterative migrations for one feature, emit:

- `[SHOULD_FIX]` – asking the author to collapse them into a clean final
  migration set.

### 5.2 Respect environment-specific tooling

When suggesting commands, align with the repo’s tooling:

- For Django4Lyfe / Optimo, prefer:
  - `uv run` / `.bin/django` wrappers as documented in `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`.

This Skill should conceptually describe the migration cleanup steps, not hard
code commands that may become outdated.

## Checklist 6 – Downtime-Safe Schema Changes

This is the most critical part of the Skill for production stability.

### 6.1 Deleting a field or table

If the PR both:

- Removes a field from the database (or drops a table), **and**
- Removes or changes code that uses that field,

then:

- Highlight the deployment risk:
  - Between the time migrations run and the time all web workers are updated,
    old code can still expect the field and will throw errors if it is already
    dropped.

Enforce the safe two-step pattern:

1. **PR 1 – Code-only removal**
   - Remove all usage of the field/table from code (queries, serializers,
     forms, admin, etc.).
   - Keep the field in the DB so old and new code can still run.
   - Deploy fully.
2. **PR 2 – Schema removal**
   - Add a migration that drops the field/table.
   - Deploy once no running code expects it.

If a single PR contains both the schema drop and remaining code references, or
removes code and schema at once in a way that risks downtime, emit:

- `[BLOCKING]` – and explicitly recommend splitting into two PRs as above.

### 6.2 Adding a non-volatile default on a large table

For a new column on a large / hot table with a **static default** (e.g.
`is_active = True`):

- Explain the risk:
  - A naive `AddField` with default can cause a long-running table rewrite and
    lock, blocking writes and potentially causing errors.

Enforce a safe pattern:

1. **Migration 1 – Add nullable column, no default**
   - Add the column with `null=True` and no default.
   - This ensures the `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` is fast.
2. **Migration 2 – Set default and backfill**
   - For Postgres 11+:
     - Use `RunSQL` to set the default for **new rows** only, avoiding a full
       table rewrite.
   - For existing rows:
     - Use a data migration, background job, or batched updates to set the
       value in manageable chunks, ideally with `atomic = False` for large
       operations.

If the PR adds a non-nullable column with a default on a table that likely has
many rows, emit:

- `[SHOULD_FIX]` or `[BLOCKING]` depending on table size and risk, and
  describe the two-step pattern above.

### 6.3 Adding a volatile default (e.g. UUID, timestamps)

For defaults that require dynamic values (e.g. generate UUIDs, timestamps):

- Warn that:
  - Setting such defaults on existing rows inside an atomic migration, for a
    large table, can be very slow and lock-heavy.

Recommend:

1. Add the column as nullable without default.
2. Backfill in batches using a non-atomic migration or out-of-band job.
3. Only then, if needed, add a default for **new** rows.

If a PR uses a volatile default in a way that will backfill a large table
inside an atomic migration, emit:

- `[BLOCKING]` – and propose the batched, non-atomic backfill approach.

## How This Skill Should Behave in Practice

When invoked, this Skill should:

1. Gather the inputs listed above (branch, PR title/description, base branch,
   migration/schema summary).
2. Apply each checklist in order:
   - ClickUp & naming.
   - WIP & base branch.
   - PR description & self-review.
   - Release/hotfix flow.
   - Migrations.
   - Downtime-safe schema changes.
3. Emit:
   - A short summary paragraph.
   - `What’s aligned` bullets.
   - `Needs changes` bullets with `[BLOCKING]`, `[SHOULD_FIX]`, `[NIT]`.
4. Be direct and pedantic but constructive:
   - Treat automation, traceability, and downtime-safety as **hard**
     requirements, not nice-to-haves.
   - Always provide specific, actionable corrections rather than vague
     guidance.
