# CI/CD Quality & Debugging Loop (Loop 3)

**Purpose**: Continuous integration with automated failure recovery and authentic quality validation.

**SOP Workflow**: Specification → Research → Planning → Execution → Knowledge

**Output**: 100% test success rate with authentic quality improvements and failure pattern analysis

**Integration**: This is Loop 3 of 3. Receives from `parallel-swarm-implementation` (Loop 2), feeds failure data back to `research-driven-planning` (Loop 1).

**Version**: 2.0.0
**Optimization**: Evidence-based prompting with explicit agent SOPs

---

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- Have complete implementation from Loop 2 (parallel-swarm-implementation)
- Need CI/CD pipeline automation with intelligent recovery
- Require root cause analysis for test failures
- Want automated repair with connascence-aware fixes
- Need validation of authentic quality (no theater)
- Generating failure patterns for Loop 1 feedback

**DO NOT** use this skill for:
- Initial development (use Loop 2 first)
- Manual debugging without CI/CD integration
- Quality checks during development (use Loop 2 theater detection)

---

## Step 1: GitHub Hook Integration

**Objective**: Download and process CI/CD pipeline failure reports from GitHub Actions.

**Agent Coordination**: Single orchestrator agent manages data collection.

### Configure GitHub Hooks

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if needed
which gh || brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Configure webhook listener
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/hooks \
  -X POST \
  -f name='web' \
  -f active=true \
  -f events='["check_run", "workflow_run"]' \
  -f config[url]='http://localhost:3000/hooks/github' \
  -f config[content_type]='application/json'
```

### Download Failure Reports

```bash
# Get recent workflow runs
gh run list --repo {owner}/{repo} --limit 10 --json conclusion,databaseId \
  | jq '.[] | select(.conclusion == "failure")' \
  > .claude/.artifacts/failed-runs.json

# Download logs for each failure
cat .claude/.artifacts/failed-runs.json | jq -r '.databaseId' | while read RUN_ID; do
  gh run view $RUN_ID --log \
    > .claude/.artifacts/failure-logs-$RUN_ID.txt
done
```

### Parse Failure Data

```bash
node <<'EOF'
const fs = require('fs');
const failures = [];

// Parse all failure logs
const logFiles = fs.readdirSync('.claude/.artifacts')
  .filter(f => f.startsWith('failure-logs-'));

logFiles.forEach(file => {
  const log = fs.readFileSync(`.claude/.artifacts/${file}`, 'utf8');

  // Extract structured failure data
  const failureMatches = log.matchAll(/FAIL (.+?):(\d+):(\d+)\n(.+?)\n(.+)/g);

  for (const match of failureMatches) {
    failures.push({
      file: match[1],
      line: parseInt(match[2]),
      column: parseInt(match[3]),
      testName: match[4],
      errorMessage: match[5],
      runId: file.match(/failure-logs-(\d+)/)[1]
    });
  }
});

fs.writeFileSync(
  '.claude/.artifacts/parsed-failures.json',
  JSON.stringify(failures, null, 2)
);

console.log(`✅ Parsed ${failures.length} failures`);
EOF
```

**Validation Checkpoint**:
- ✅ Failure data parsed and structured
- ✅ All required fields present (file, line, testName, errorMessage)

---

## Step 2: AI-Powered Analysis

**Objective**: Use Gemini large-context analysis + 7 research agents with Byzantine consensus to examine each failure deeply.

**Evidence-Based Techniques**: Self-consistency, Byzantine consensus, program-of-thought

### Phase 1: Gemini Large-Context Analysis

**Leverage Gemini's 2M token window for full codebase analysis**

```bash
# Analyze failures with full codebase context
/gemini:impact "Analyze CI/CD test failures:

FAILURE DATA:
$(cat .claude/.artifacts/parsed-failures.json)

CODEBASE CONTEXT:
Full repository (all files)

LOOP 2 IMPLEMENTATION:
$(cat .claude/.artifacts/loop2-delivery-package.json)

ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES:
1. Identify cross-file dependencies related to failures
2. Detect failure cascade patterns (root → secondary → tertiary)
3. Analyze what changed between working and failing states
4. Assess system-level architectural impact
5. Identify connascence patterns in failing code

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  dependency_graph: { nodes: [files], edges: [dependencies] },
  cascade_map: { root_failures: [], cascaded_failures: [] },
  change_analysis: { changed_files: [], change_impact: [] },
  architectural_impact: { affected_systems: [], coupling_issues: [] }
}"

# Store Gemini analysis
cat .claude/.artifacts/gemini-response.json \
  > .claude/.artifacts/gemini-analysis.json
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Multi-Agent Deep Dive (Self-Consistency)

**7 parallel agents for cross-validation and consensus**

```javascript
// PARALLEL ANALYSIS AGENTS - Evidence-Based Self-Consistency
[Single Message - Spawn All 7 Analysis Agents]:

  // Failure Pattern Research (Dual agents for cross-validation)
  Task("Failure Pattern Researcher 1",
    `Research similar failures in external sources:
    - GitHub issues for libraries we use
    - Stack Overflow questions with similar error messages
    - Documentation of known issues

    Failures to research: $(cat .claude/.artifacts/parsed-failures.json | jq -r '.[].errorMessage')

    For each failure:
    1. Find similar reported issues
    2. Document known solutions with evidence (links, code examples)
    3. Note confidence level (high/medium/low)

    Store findings: .claude/.artifacts/failure-patterns-researcher1.json

    2. Determine which is more current/reliable
    3. Flag disagreements for consensus

  // Error Analysis Specialist
  Task("Error Message Analyzer",
    `Deep dive into error messages and stack traces:

    Failures: $(cat .claude/.artifacts/parsed-failures.json)

    For each error message:
    1. Parse error semantics (syntax error vs runtime vs logic)
    2. Extract root cause from stack trace (not just symptoms)
    3. Identify error propagation patterns
    4. Distinguish between:
       - Direct causes (code that threw error)
       - Indirect causes (code that set up failure conditions)

    Apply program-of-thought reasoning:
    "Error X occurred because Y, which was caused by Z"

    `Analyze surrounding code context for failures:

    Load: .claude/.artifacts/parsed-failures.json
    Load: .claude/.artifacts/gemini-analysis.json (for dependency context)

    For each failure:
    1. Read file at failure line ±50 lines
    2. Identify why failure occurs in THIS specific codebase
    3. Find coupling issues (tight coupling → cascading failures)
    4. Analyze code smells that contributed to failure

    Context analysis:
    - Variable/function naming clarity
    - Error handling presence/absence
    - Input validation
    - Edge case handling

    Store findings: .claude/.artifacts/code-context.json
    Use hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "code-context"`,
    "code-analyzer")

  // Test Validity Auditors (Dual agents for critical validation)
  Task("Test Validity Auditor 1",
    `Determine if tests are correctly written:

    Load failures: .claude/.artifacts/parsed-failures.json

    For each failing test:
    1. Is test logic correct? (proper assertions, valid test data)
    2. Is failure indicating real bug or test issue?
    3. Check test quality:
       - Proper setup/teardown
       - Isolated (not depending on other tests)
       - Deterministic (not flaky)

    Categorize:
    - Real bugs: Code is wrong, test is correct
    - Test issues: Code is correct, test is wrong
    - Both wrong: Code and test both have issues

    Store analysis: .claude/.artifacts/test-validity-1.json

    Additional checks:
    1. Compare to Loop 2 theater baseline
    2. Check for test theater patterns:
       - Meaningless assertions (expect(1).toBe(1))
       - Over-mocking (mocking the thing being tested)
       - False positives (tests that don't actually test)

    For disagreements with Auditor 1:
    1. Re-examine test thoroughly
    2. Document reasoning for different conclusion
    3. Flag for consensus resolution

    Store analysis: .claude/.artifacts/test-validity-2.json
    Use hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "test-validity-2"`,

    Analysis steps:
    1. Check package.json/requirements.txt for version conflicts
    2. Identify breaking changes in dependencies:
       - Compare current versions to last working versions
       - Review CHANGELOG files for breaking changes
       - Check deprecation warnings

    3. Analyze transitive dependencies:
       - npm ls or pip list --tree
       - Find version conflicts in dep tree

    4. Check for missing dependencies:
       - ImportError / Cannot find module
       - Missing peer dependencies

    "analyst")

// Wait for all 7 agents to complete
npx claude-flow@alpha task wait --all --namespace "cicd/analysis"
```

### Phase 3: Synthesis with Byzantine Consensus

**Byzantine fault-tolerant synthesis requires 5/7 agent agreement**

```javascript
[Single Message - Synthesis Coordinator]:
  Task("Analysis Synthesis Coordinator",
    `Synthesize findings from Gemini + 7 agents using Byzantine consensus.

    INPUTS:
    - Gemini Analysis: .claude/.artifacts/gemini-analysis.json
    - Researcher 1: .claude/.artifacts/failure-patterns-researcher1.json
    - Researcher 2: .claude/.artifacts/failure-patterns-researcher2.json
    - Error Analyzer: .claude/.artifacts/error-analysis.json
    - Code Context: .claude/.artifacts/code-context.json
    - Test Auditor 1: .claude/.artifacts/test-validity-1.json
    - Test Auditor 2: .claude/.artifacts/test-validity-2.json
    - Dependency Detector: .claude/.artifacts/dependency-analysis.json

    SYNTHESIS PROCESS:

    1. Cross-Reference Analysis:
       For each failure, collect all agent findings
       Build confidence matrix: which agents agree on root cause

    2. Byzantine Consensus:
       For each root cause claim:
       - Count agent agreement (need 5/7 for consensus)
       - Weight by agent confidence scores
       - Flag conflicts (< 5/7 agreement) for manual review

    3. Consolidate Root Causes:
       - Primary causes: 7/7 agreement (highest confidence)
       - Secondary causes: 5-6/7 agreement (medium confidence)
       - Disputed causes: < 5/7 agreement (flag for review)

    4. Generate Synthesis Report:
       {
         rootCauses: [
           {
             failure: failure_object,
             cause: "root cause description",
             evidence: ["agent1 finding", "agent2 finding"],
             consensus: 7/7 or 6/7 or 5/7,
             confidence: "high" | "medium" | "low"
           }
         ],
         cascadingFailures: [
           { root: failure_id, cascaded: [failure_ids] }
         ],
         quickWins: [ /* easy fixes */ ],
         complexIssues: [ /* require architecture changes */ ]
       }

    VALIDATION:
    - All failures must be categorized
    - Root causes must have >= 5/7 consensus or be flagged
    - Cascading relationships must be validated by Gemini graph

    Store: .claude/.artifacts/analysis-synthesis.json
    Use hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "synthesis-consensus"`,
    "byzantine-coordinator")
```

**Validation Checkpoint**:
- ✅ Gemini analysis complete (dependency graph, cascade map)
- ✅ All 7 agents completed analysis
- ✅ Byzantine consensus achieved (5/7 agreement on root causes)
- ✅ Synthesis report generated with confidence scores

---

## Step 3: Root Cause Detection

**Objective**: Reverse engineer to find cascade issues and true root causes using graph analysis and Raft consensus.

**Evidence-Based Techniques**: Graph algorithms, connascence analysis, Raft consensus

### Phase 1: Parallel Cascade Graph Analysis

**Multiple graph analysts for validation**

```javascript
[Single Message - Parallel Graph Analysis]:

  Task("Failure Graph Analyst 1",
    `Build failure dependency graph using graph algorithms:

    Load: .claude/.artifacts/parsed-failures.json
    Load: .claude/.artifacts/gemini-analysis.json (dependency context)

    GRAPH CONSTRUCTION:
    1. Nodes: Each failure is a node
    2. Edges: Failure A → Failure B if:
       - B's error message references A's file
       - B's file imports A's file
       - B's line number > A's line number in same file
       - Gemini dependency graph shows A → B relationship

    3. Apply graph algorithms:
       - Topological sort to find root nodes (no incoming edges)
       - Calculate cascade depth (max distance from root)
       - Find strongly connected components (circular dependencies)

    4. Identify root causes:
       Root = node with 0 incoming edges OR
       Root = node in cycle with most outgoing edges

    OUTPUT:
    {
      graph: { nodes: [], edges: [] },
      roots: [ /* root failure nodes */ ],
      cascadeMap: { /* depth levels */ },
      circularDeps: [ /* cycles detected */ ]
    }

    Store: .claude/.artifacts/failure-graph-1.json
    Use hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "graph-1"`,
    "analyst")

  Task("Failure Graph Analyst 2",
    `Validate graph structure from Analyst 1:

    Load: .claude/.artifacts/failure-graph-1.json
    Load: .claude/.artifacts/analysis-synthesis.json (consensus data)

    VALIDATION PROCESS:
    1. Cross-check edges:
       - Verify each edge using synthesis consensus
       - Remove edges with low confidence (< 5/7 agreement)
       - Add missing edges identified by consensus

    2. Identify hidden cascades:
       - Indirect cascades (A → B → C, but A → C not obvious)
       - Time-based cascades (A fails first, causes B later)
       - State-based cascades (A leaves bad state, B fails on it)

    3. Validate root cause claims:
       For each claimed root:
       - Verify no hidden dependencies
       - Check if truly primary or just first detected
       - Use 5-Whys: "Why did this fail?" → repeat 5 times

    OUTPUT:
    {
      validatedGraph: { /* corrected graph */ },
      validatedRoots: [ /* confirmed roots */ ],
      hiddenCascades: [ /* newly discovered */ ],
      conflicts: [ /* disagreements with Analyst 1 */ ]
    }

    Store: .claude/.artifacts/failure-graph-2.json
    Use hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "graph-2"`,
    "analyst")

// Wait for graph analysis
npx claude-flow@alpha task wait --namespace "cicd/graph-analysis"
```

### Phase 2: Connascence Analysis

**Identify code coupling that affects fix strategy**

```javascript
[Single Message - Parallel Connascence Detection]:

  Task("Connascence Detector (Name)",
    `Scan for connascence of name: shared variable/function names causing failures.

    Load root causes: .claude/.artifacts/failure-graph-2.json (validatedRoots)

    For each root cause file:
    1. Find all references to symbols (variables, functions, classes)
    2. Identify which files import/use these symbols
    3. Determine if failure requires changes across multiple files

    Connascence of Name = When changing a name requires changing it everywhere

    Impact on fixes:
    - High connascence = Must fix all references atomically
    - Low connascence = Can fix in isolation

    Store: .claude/.artifacts/connascence-name.json
    Use hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "conn-name"`,
    "code-analyzer")

  Task("Connascence Detector (Type)",
    `Scan for connascence of type: type dependencies causing failures.

    Load root causes: .claude/.artifacts/failure-graph-2.json

    For each root cause:
    1. Identify type signatures (function params, return types)
    2. Find all code that depends on these types
    3. Check if failure requires type changes

    Connascence of Type = When changing a type requires updating all users

    TypeScript/Python type hints make this explicit:
    - function foo(x: string) → changing to number affects all callers

    Store: .claude/.artifacts/connascence-type.json
    Use hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "conn-type"`,
    "code-analyzer")

  Task("Connascence Detector (Algorithm)",
    `Scan for connascence of algorithm: shared algorithms causing failures.

    Load root causes: .claude/.artifacts/failure-graph-2.json

    For each root cause:
    1. Identify algorithmic dependencies:
       - Shared validation logic
       - Shared calculation methods
       - Shared state management patterns

    2. Find code using these algorithms
    3. Determine if fix requires algorithm changes across multiple locations

    Connascence of Algorithm = When multiple parts depend on same algorithm

    Example: If authentication algorithm is wrong, must fix:
    - Auth service
    - Token validation
    - Session management

    Store: .claude/.artifacts/connascence-algorithm.json
    Use hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "conn-algorithm"`,
    "code-analyzer")

// Wait for connascence analysis
npx claude-flow@alpha task wait --namespace "cicd/connascence"
```

### Phase 3: Raft Consensus on Root Causes

**Leader-based consensus for final root cause list**

```javascript
[Single Message - Root Cause Consensus]:

  Task("Root Cause Validator",
    `Validate each identified root cause using 5-Whys methodology.

    Load: .claude/.artifacts/failure-graph-2.json (validatedRoots)
    Load: .claude/.artifacts/analysis-synthesis.json (consensus data)

    For each root cause:
    Apply 5-Whys:
    1. Why did this test fail? → [answer]
    2. Why did [answer] happen? → [deeper answer]
    3. Why did [deeper answer] happen? → [deeper still]
    4. Why did [deeper still] happen? → [approaching root]
    5. Why did [approaching root] happen? → TRUE ROOT CAUSE

    Validate:
    - If 5-Whys reveals deeper cause, update root cause
    - If already at true root, confirm
    - Ensure not stopping at symptom

    Store: .claude/.artifacts/root-cause-validation.json
    Use hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "root-validation"`,
    "analyst")

  Task("Root Cause Consensus Coordinator (Raft)",
    `Use Raft consensus to generate final root cause list.

    INPUTS:
    - Graph Analyst 1: .claude/.artifacts/failure-graph-1.json
    - Graph Analyst 2: .claude/.artifacts/failure-graph-2.json
    - Root Cause Validator: .claude/.artifacts/root-cause-validation.json
    - Connascence Detectors: .claude/.artifacts/connascence-*.json

    RAFT CONSENSUS PROCESS:

    1. Leader Election:
       - Graph Analyst 2 is leader (most validated data)
       - Analyst 1 and Validator are followers

    2. Log Replication:
       - Leader proposes root cause list
       - Followers validate against their data
       - Require majority agreement (2/3)

    3. Conflict Resolution:
       For disagreements:
       - Leader's validated graph is authoritative
       - But if Validator's 5-Whys reveals deeper cause, override
       - If Analyst 1 found hidden cascade, add to list

    4. Generate Final Root Cause List:
       {
         roots: [
           {
             failure: failure_object,
             rootCause: "true root cause from 5-Whys",
             cascadedFailures: [failure_ids],
             connascenceContext: {
               name: [affected_files],
               type: [type_dependencies],
               algorithm: [shared_algorithms]
             },
             fixComplexity: "simple" | "moderate" | "complex",
             fixStrategy: "isolated" | "bundled" | "architectural"
           }
         ],
         stats: {
           totalFailures: number,
           rootFailures: number,
           cascadedFailures: number,
           cascadeRatio: percentage
         }
       }

    VALIDATION:
    - All failures accounted for (either root or cascaded)
    - Root causes have 5-Whys validation
    - Connascence context complete for bundled fixes
    - Fix strategies aligned with connascence analysis

    Store: .claude/.artifacts/root-causes-consensus.json
    Use hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "root-consensus"`,
    "raft-manager")
```

**Validation Checkpoint**:
- ✅ Failure dependency graph validated by 2 analysts
- ✅ Connascence analysis complete (name, type, algorithm)
- ✅ Root causes validated with 5-Whys methodology
- ✅ Raft consensus achieved on final root cause list
- ✅ Fix strategies determined based on connascence context

---

## Step 4: Intelligent Fixes

**Objective**: Automated repair with connascence-aware context bundling using program-of-thought structure.

**Evidence-Based Techniques**: Program-of-thought (Plan → Execute → Validate → Approve), self-consistency, consensus approval

### Program-of-Thought Fix Generation

**Explicit Plan → Execute → Validate → Approve for each root cause**

```bash
# Load root causes from Raft consensus
ROOT_CAUSES=$(cat .claude/.artifacts/root-causes-consensus.json | jq -r '.roots[] | @base64')

for ROOT_CAUSE_B64 in $ROOT_CAUSES; do
  ROOT_CAUSE=$(echo "$ROOT_CAUSE_B64" | base64 -d)
  FAILURE_ID=$(echo "$ROOT_CAUSE" | jq -r '.failure.testName')

  echo "=== Fixing Root Cause: $FAILURE_ID ==="

  # PHASE 1: PLANNING
  [Single Message - Fix Strategy Planning]:
    Task("Fix Strategy Planner",
      `MISSION: Plan fix strategy for root cause failure.

      ROOT CAUSE DATA:
      ${ROOT_CAUSE}

      CONNASCENCE CONTEXT:
      Name: $(echo "$ROOT_CAUSE" | jq '.connascenceContext.name')
      Type: $(echo "$ROOT_CAUSE" | jq '.connascenceContext.type')
      Algorithm: $(echo "$ROOT_CAUSE" | jq '.connascenceContext.algorithm')

      PLANNING STEPS (Program-of-Thought):

      Step 1: Understand Root Cause Deeply
      - What is the TRUE root cause (not symptom)?
      - Why did this occur (5-Whys result)?
      - What conditions led to this?

      Step 2: Identify All Affected Files
      - Primary file (where failure occurred)
      - Connascence name files (shared symbols)
      - Connascence type files (type dependencies)
      - Connascence algorithm files (shared logic)

      Step 3: Design Minimal Fix
      - What is the SMALLEST change that fixes root cause?
      - Can we fix in one file or need bundled changes?
      - Are there architectural issues requiring refactor?

      Step 4: Predict Side Effects
      - What else might break from this fix?
      - Are there cascaded failures that will auto-resolve?
      - Are there hidden dependencies not in connascence?

      Step 5: Plan Validation Approach
      - Which tests must pass?
      - Which tests might fail (expected)?
      - Need new tests for edge cases?

      OUTPUT (Detailed Fix Plan):
      {
        rootCause: "description",
        fixStrategy: "isolated" | "bundled" | "architectural",
        files: [
          { path: "file.js", reason: "primary failure location", changes: "description" },

      LOAD FIX PLAN:
      $(cat .claude/.artifacts/fix-plan-${FAILURE_ID}.json)

      IMPLEMENTATION STEPS (Program-of-Thought):

      Step 1: Load All Affected Files
      - Read each file from fix plan
      - Understand current implementation
      - Locate exact change points

      Step 2: Apply Minimal Fix
      - Implement smallest change from plan
      - Follow fix strategy (isolated vs bundled)
      - For bundled: apply ALL related changes ATOMICALLY

      Step 3: Show Your Work (Reasoning)
      For each change, document:
      - What changed: "Changed X from Y to Z"
      - Why changed: "Because root cause was..."
      - Connascence impact: "Also updated N, T, A files due to connascence"
      - Edge cases handled: "Added validation for..."

      Step 4: Generate Fix Patch
      - Create git diff patch
      - Include all files (atomic bundle)
      - Add descriptive commit message with reasoning

      VALIDATION BEFORE STORING:
      - All files from plan are changed?
      - Changes are minimal (no scope creep)?
      - Connascence context preserved?
      - Code compiles/lints?

      SANDBOX VALIDATION PROCESS:

      1. Create Isolated Sandbox:
         - Use production-like environment
         - Clean state (no contamination)

      2. Deploy Fix:
         - Apply patch to sandbox codebase
         - Install dependencies
         - Run build/compile

      3. Run Test Suite:
         - Run failing test (must now pass)
         - Run all tests in affected modules
         - Run integration tests

      4. Verify Fix Resolves Root Cause:
         - Check if root cause symptoms gone
         - Verify cascaded failures auto-resolved
         - Ensure no new failures introduced

      THEATER DETECTION PROCESS:

      1. Fix Theater Scan:
         - Did fix comment out failing test? ❌ THEATER
         - Did fix add "return true" without logic? ❌ THEATER
         - Did fix suppress error without handling? ❌ THEATER

      2. Mock Escalation Check:
         - Did fix add more mocks instead of fixing code? ❌ THEATER
         - Example: jest.mock('./auth', () => ({ login: () => true }))
         - This masks failure, doesn't fix it

      3. Coverage Theater Check:
         - Did fix add meaningless tests for coverage? ❌ THEATER
         - Example: test('filler', () => expect(1).toBe(1))

      4. Compare to Loop 2 Baseline:
         - Is theater level same or reduced?
         - Any new theater introduced?
         - Calculate theater delta

      5. Authentic Improvement Validation:
         - Does fix address root cause genuinely?

         - Will fix hold up in production?

## Step 5: Theater Detection Audit

**Objective**: Validate that fixes are authentic improvements using 6-agent Byzantine consensus.

**Evidence-Based Techniques**: Self-consistency (multiple theater detectors), Byzantine consensus

### Load Loop 2 Theater Baseline

```bash
# Get theater baseline from Loop 2
BASELINE=$(npx claude-flow@alpha memory query "loop2_theater_baseline" \
  --namespace "integration/loop3-validation")

    - Placeholder implementations (throw new Error('Not implemented'))

    Scan all fixed files: $(ls .claude/.artifacts/fixes/*.patch | xargs -I {} basename {})

    For each pattern found:
    1. File location
    2. Pattern type
    3. Severity (critical/medium/low)

## Step 6: Sandbox Validation

**Objective**: Test all changes in isolated production-like environments before deployment.

### Create Isolated Test Environment

```bash
# Full stack sandbox with production-like config
SANDBOX_ID=$(npx claude-flow@alpha sandbox create \
  --template "production-mirror" \
  --env-vars '{
    "NODE_ENV": "test",
    "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/test",
    "REDIS_URL": "redis://localhost:6379"
  }' | jq -r '.id')

echo "Sandbox created: $SANDBOX_ID"
```

### Deploy Fixed Code

```bash
# Upload all fixed files
git diff HEAD --name-only | while read FILE; do
  npx claude-flow@alpha sandbox upload \
    --sandbox-id "$SANDBOX_ID" \
    --file "$FILE" \
    --content "$(cat "$FILE")"
done

echo "✅ Fixed code deployed to sandbox"
```

### Run Comprehensive Test Suite

```bash
# Unit tests
echo "Running unit tests..."
npx claude-flow@alpha sandbox execute \
  --sandbox-id "$SANDBOX_ID" \
  --code "npm run test:unit" \
  --timeout 300000 \
  > .claude/.artifacts/sandbox-unit-tests.log

# Integration tests
echo "Running integration tests..."
npx claude-flow@alpha sandbox execute \
  --sandbox-id "$SANDBOX_ID" \
  --code "npm run test:integration" \
  --timeout 600000 \
  > .claude/.artifacts/sandbox-integration-tests.log

# E2E tests
echo "Running E2E tests..."
npx claude-flow@alpha sandbox execute \
  --sandbox-id "$SANDBOX_ID" \
  --code "npm run test:e2e" \
  --timeout 900000 \
  > .claude/.artifacts/sandbox-e2e-tests.log

# Collect all results
npx claude-flow@alpha sandbox logs \
  --sandbox-id "$SANDBOX_ID" \
  > .claude/.artifacts/sandbox-test-results.log
```

### Validate Success Criteria

```bash
# Parse test results
TOTAL_TESTS=$(grep -oP '\d+ tests' .claude/.artifacts/sandbox-test-results.log | head -1 | grep -oP '\d+')
PASSED_TESTS=$(grep -oP '\d+ passed' .claude/.artifacts/sandbox-test-results.log | head -1 | grep -oP '\d+')

if [ "$PASSED_TESTS" -eq "$TOTAL_TESTS" ]; then
  echo "✅ 100% test success in sandbox ($PASSED_TESTS/$TOTAL_TESTS)"

  # Store success metrics
  echo "{\"total\": $TOTAL_TESTS, \"passed\": $PASSED_TESTS, \"successRate\": 100}" \
    > .claude/.artifacts/sandbox-success-metrics.json
else
  echo "❌ Only $PASSED_TESTS/$TOTAL_TESTS passed"

  # Store failure data for analysis
  echo "{\"total\": $TOTAL_TESTS, \"passed\": $PASSED_TESTS, \"successRate\": $((PASSED_TESTS * 100 / TOTAL_TESTS))}" \
    > .claude/.artifacts/sandbox-failure-metrics.json

  exit 1
fi

# Cleanup sandbox
npx claude-flow@alpha sandbox delete --sandbox-id "$SANDBOX_ID"
```

**Validation Checkpoint**:
- ✅ Sandbox environment created with production-like config
- ✅ Fixed code deployed successfully
- ✅ All test suites passed (unit, integration, E2E)
- ✅ 100% test success rate achieved

---

## Step 7: Differential Analysis

**Objective**: Compare sandbox results to original failure reports with comprehensive metrics.

### Generate Comparison Report

```bash

## Troubleshooting

### Sandbox Tests Fail Despite Local Success

**Symptom**: Tests pass locally but fail in sandbox
**Fix**:
```bash
# Check environment differences
diff <(env | sort) <(npx claude-flow@alpha sandbox execute --sandbox-id "$SANDBOX_ID" --code "env | sort")

# Add missing env vars
npx claude-flow@alpha sandbox configure \
  --sandbox-id "$SANDBOX_ID" \
  --env-vars "$MISSING_VARS"
```

### Root Cause Detection Misses Primary Issue

**Symptom**: Fixes don't resolve all failures
**Fix**:
```bash
# Re-run analysis with deeper context
/gemini:impact "deep analysis: $(cat .claude/.artifacts/parsed-failures.json)" \
  --context "full-codebase" \
  --depth "maximum"

# Re-run graph analysis with more analysts
# Add third graph analyst for tie-breaking
```

### GitHub Hooks Not Triggering

**Symptom**: Loop 3 doesn't receive CI/CD notifications
**Fix**:
```bash
# Verify webhook configuration
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/hooks | jq '.[] | select(.config.url | contains("localhost"))'

# Re-configure with ngrok or public URL
ngrok http 3000
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/hooks/{hook_id} -X PATCH \
  -f config[url]="https://{ngrok-url}/hooks/github"
```

### Byzantine Consensus Fails to Reach Agreement

**Symptom**: Analysis agents disagree, consensus blocked
**Fix**:
```bash
# Lower consensus threshold temporarily (5/7 → 4/7)
# Review disagreements manually
cat .claude/.artifacts/analysis-synthesis.json | jq '.conflicts'

# Add tiebreaker agent
Task("Tiebreaker Analyst", "Review conflicts and make final decision", "analyst")
```

---
