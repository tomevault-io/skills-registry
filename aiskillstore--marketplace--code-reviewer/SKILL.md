# Code Reviewer

## Purpose
Provides comprehensive code review following industry best practices, focusing on code quality, security, performance, and maintainability.

## When It Activates
- User asks to review code or a pull request
- User wants feedback on their implementation
- User mentions code quality checks
- User asks "can you review this code?"

## Instructions

When reviewing code, systematically analyze:

### 1. Code Quality
- **Readability**: Is the code clear and self-documenting?
- **Naming**: Are variables, functions, and classes well-named?
- **Complexity**: Are there overly complex sections that need refactoring?
- **DRY Principle**: Is there unnecessary code duplication?

### 2. Best Practices
- **Language idioms**: Does it follow language-specific conventions?
- **Design patterns**: Are appropriate patterns used correctly?
- **Error handling**: Are errors properly caught and handled?
- **Logging**: Is there adequate logging for debugging?

### 3. Security
- **Input validation**: Are all inputs properly validated?
- **SQL injection**: Are database queries parameterized?
- **XSS vulnerabilities**: Is output properly escaped?
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Are permissions checked?
- **Sensitive data**: Are secrets properly protected?

### 4. Performance
- **Algorithmic complexity**: Can performance be improved?
- **Database queries**: Are they efficient (N+1 queries)?
- **Memory usage**: Are there potential memory leaks?
- **Caching**: Could caching improve performance?

### 5. Testing
- **Test coverage**: Are there tests for new functionality?
- **Edge cases**: Are edge cases covered?
- **Test quality**: Are tests meaningful and maintainable?

### 6. Documentation
- **Comments**: Are complex sections explained?
- **API docs**: Are public interfaces documented?
- **README updates**: Does documentation need updating?

## Review Format

Present findings as:

1. **Summary**: Quick overview of the review
2. **Strengths**: What's done well
3. **Issues Found**: Organized by severity (Critical, Major, Minor)
4. **Recommendations**: Specific, actionable improvements
5. **Code Suggestions**: Example code for improvements

## Tone
- Be constructive and encouraging
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Offer alternatives when pointing out issues
- Acknowledge good practices

## Examples

### Example 1: Security Issue
**Issue**: SQL query using string concatenation
**Severity**: Critical
**Why**: Vulnerable to SQL injection attacks
**Fix**: Use parameterized queries
```python
# Bad
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")

# Good
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))
```

### Example 2: Code Quality
**Issue**: Nested if statements creating high complexity
**Severity**: Minor
**Why**: Reduces readability and maintainability
**Fix**: Use guard clauses or extract to functions
