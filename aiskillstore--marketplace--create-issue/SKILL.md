# Create Issue

Create an issue in the appropriate tracker (GitHub Issues or Jira).

## Step 1: Detect Issue Tracker

1. **Get repository name**: `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`
2. **Check if GitHub issues are enabled**:

   ```bash
   gh repo view --json hasIssuesEnabled --jq '.hasIssuesEnabled'
   ```

   - If `true` → Create GitHub issue
   - If `false` → Create Jira issue

3. **Determine issue type**: Task, Bug, or Story
4. **Check for assignee** in user's request
5. **Determine priority/labels** based on severity

---

## GitHub Issues

If GitHub issues are enabled, use `gh issue create`.

### Step 2a: Write issue body to `issue-body.md`

Use the appropriate template based on issue type (see Templates section below).

**Note:** This file will be deleted after the command runs.

### Step 2b: Run gh command

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "<SUMMARY>" \
  --body-file issue-body.md \
  --label "<LABEL>" && rm issue-body.md
```

Add `--assignee "<username>"` if user specified an assignee.

**Note:** No repo name prefix needed - GitHub issues are already scoped to the repository.

---

## Jira Issues

If GitHub issues are disabled, use `jira issue create`.

### Step 2a: Write issue body to `issue-body.md`

Use the appropriate template based on issue type (see Templates section below).

**Note:** This file will be deleted after the command runs.

### Step 2b: Run jira command

```bash
jira issue create --no-input \
  --type "<TYPE>" \
  --priority "<PRIORITY>" \
  --label "<LABEL>" \
  --summary "[<REPO-NAME>] <SUMMARY>" \
  --template issue-body.md && rm issue-body.md
```

Add `--assignee "<username>"` if user specified an assignee.

- **Release Planning:** Detail feature flags, rollback plans, or special deployment instructions

## Testing Strategy

- **Testing Requirements:** Define testing requirements beyond acceptance criteria
- **Test Scenarios:** Outline key test cases and scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

- Draft detailed acceptance criteria covering all success scenarios and all error paths
- Variations due to dynamic factors
- Ensure the criteria are measurable and leave no room for ambiguity

## Post-Release Monitoring

## Priority Mapping (Jira only)

| Severity | Jira Priority |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Critical | Blocker |
| High | Critical |
| Medium | Major |
| Low | Minor |
| Info | Minor |

## Important Rules

- **GitHub Issues:**
  - Use `gh issue create` with `--body-file`
  - No repo name prefix needed (issues are scoped to repo)
  - Labels are simple strings (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`)
- **Jira Issues:**
  - Always prefix summary with repo name: `[repo-name] Brief description`
  - Always use `--no-input` flag to prevent interactive prompts
  - Do NOT specify a project (`-p` or `--project`) - use default from user's config
  - Set 15 second timeout - if it hangs, the command is malformed
- **Both:**
  - Use Markdown format
  - Use `##` for main headings, `-` for bullet points
  - Use backticks for inline code
  - For sections not applicable, write "N/A" or "Nothing to mention"
  - Delete the temp file (`issue-body.md`) after creating the issue
