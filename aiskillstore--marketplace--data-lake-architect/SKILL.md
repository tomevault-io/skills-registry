# Data Lake Architect Skill

You are an expert data lake architect specializing in modern lakehouse patterns using Rust, Parquet, Iceberg, and cloud storage. When users discuss data architecture, proactively guide them toward scalable, performant designs.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when you notice:
- Discussion about organizing data in cloud storage
- Questions about partitioning strategies
- Planning data lake or lakehouse architecture
- Schema design for analytical workloads
- Data modeling decisions (normalization vs denormalization)
- Storage layout or directory structure questions
- Mentions of data retention, archival, or lifecycle policies

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Storage Layer Organization

**Three-Tier Architecture** (Recommended):

```
data-lake/
├── raw/              # Landing zone (immutable source data)
│   ├── events/
│   │   └── date=2024-01-01/
│   │       └── hour=12/
│   │           └── batch-*.json.gz
│   └── transactions/
├── processed/        # Cleaned and validated data
│   ├── events/
│   │   └── year=2024/month=01/day=01/
│   │       └── part-*.parquet
│   └── transactions/
└── curated/          # Business-ready aggregates
    ├── daily_metrics/
    └── user_summaries/
```

**When to Suggest**:
- User is organizing a new data lake
- Data has multiple processing stages
- Need to separate concerns (ingestion, processing, serving)

**Guidance**:
```
I recommend a three-tier architecture for your data lake:

1. RAW (Bronze): Immutable source data, any format
   - Keep original data for reprocessing
   - Use compression (gzip/snappy)
   - Organize by ingestion date

2. PROCESSED (Silver): Cleaned, validated, Parquet format
   - Columnar format for analytics
   - Partitioned by business dimensions
   - Schema enforced

3. CURATED (Gold): Business-ready aggregates
   - Optimized for specific use cases
   - Pre-joined and pre-aggregated
   - Highest performance

Benefits: Separation of concerns, reprocessability, clear data lineage.
```

### 2. Partitioning Strategies

#### Time-Based Partitioning (Most Common)

**Hive-Style**:
```
events/
├── year=2024/
│   ├── month=01/
│   │   ├── day=01/
│   │   │   ├── part-00000.parquet
│   │   │   └── part-00001.parquet
│   │   └── day=02/
│   └── month=02/
```

**When to Use**:
- Time-series data (events, logs, metrics)
- Queries filter by date ranges
- Retention policies by date
- Need to delete old data efficiently

**Guidance**:
```
For time-series data, use Hive-style date partitioning:

data/events/year=2024/month=01/day=15/part-*.parquet

Benefits:
- Partition pruning for date-range queries
- Easy retention (delete old partitions)
- Standard across tools (Spark, Hive, Trino)
- Predictable performance

Granularity guide:
- Hour: High-frequency data (>1GB/hour)
- Day: Most use cases (10GB-1TB/day)
- Month: Low-frequency data (<10GB/day)
```

#### Multi-Dimensional Partitioning

**Pattern**:
```
events/
├── event_type=click/
│   └── date=2024-01-01/
├── event_type=view/
│   └── date=2024-01-01/
└── event_type=purchase/
    └── date=2024-01-01/
```

**When to Use**:
- Queries filter on specific dimensions consistently
- Multiple independent filter dimensions
- Dimension has low-to-medium cardinality (<1000 values)

**When NOT to Use**:
- High-cardinality dimensions (user_id, session_id)
- Dimensions queried inconsistently
- Too many partition columns (>4 typically)

**Guidance**:
```
Be careful with multi-dimensional partitioning. It can cause:
- Partition explosion (millions of small directories)
- Small file problem (many <10MB files)
- Poor compression

Alternative: Use Iceberg's hidden partitioning:
- Partition on derived values (year, month from timestamp)
- Users query on timestamp, not partition columns
- Can evolve partitioning without rewriting data
```

#### Hash Partitioning

**Pattern**:
```
users/
├── hash_bucket=00/
├── hash_bucket=01/
...
└── hash_bucket=ff/
```

**When to Use**:
- No natural partition dimension
- Need consistent file sizes
- Parallel processing requirements
- High-cardinality distribution

**Guidance**:
```
For data without natural partitions (like user profiles):

// Hash partition user_id into 256 buckets
let bucket = hash(user_id) % 256;
let path = format!("users/hash_bucket={:02x}/", bucket);

Benefits:
- Even data distribution
- Predictable file sizes
- Good for full scans with parallelism
```

### 3. File Sizing Strategy

**Target Sizes**:
- Individual files: **100MB - 1GB** (compressed)
- Row groups: **100MB - 1GB** (uncompressed)
- Total partition: **1GB - 100GB**

**When to Suggest**:
- User has many small files (<10MB)
- User has very large files (>2GB)
- Performance issues with queries

**Guidance**:
```
Your files are too small (<10MB). This causes:
- Too many S3 requests (slow + expensive)
- Excessive metadata overhead
- Poor compression ratios

Target 100MB-1GB per file:

// Batch writes
let mut buffer = Vec::new();
for record in records {
    buffer.push(record);
    if estimated_size(&buffer) > 500 * 1024 * 1024 {
        write_parquet_file(&buffer).await?;
        buffer.clear();
    }
}

Or implement periodic compaction to merge small files.
```

### 4. Schema Design Patterns

#### Wide Table vs. Normalized

**Wide Table** (Denormalized):
```rust
// events table with everything
struct Event {
    event_id: String,
    timestamp: i64,
    user_id: String,
    user_name: String,        // Denormalized
    user_email: String,       // Denormalized
    user_country: String,     // Denormalized
    event_type: String,
    event_properties: String,
}
```

**Normalized**:
```rust
// Separate tables
struct Event {
    event_id: String,
    timestamp: i64,
    user_id: String,  // Foreign key
    event_type: String,
}

struct User {
    user_id: String,
    name: String,
    email: String,
    country: String,
}
```

**Guidance**:
```
For analytical workloads, denormalization often wins:

Pros of wide tables:
- No joins needed (faster queries)
- Simpler query logic
- Better for columnar format

Cons:
- Data duplication
- Harder to update dimension data
- Larger storage

Recommendation:
- Use wide tables for immutable event data
- Use normalized for slowly changing dimensions
- Pre-join fact tables with dimensions in curated layer
```

#### Nested Structures

**Flat Schema**:
```rust
struct Event {
    event_id: String,
    prop_1: Option<String>,
    prop_2: Option<String>,
    prop_3: Option<String>,
    // Rigid, hard to evolve
}
```

**Nested Schema** (Better):
```rust
struct Event {
    event_id: String,
    properties: HashMap<String, String>,  // Flexible
}

// Or with strongly-typed structs
struct Event {
    event_id: String,
    metadata: Metadata,
    metrics: Vec<Metric>,
}
```

**Guidance**:
```
Parquet supports nested structures well. Use them for:
- Variable/evolving properties
- Lists of related items
- Hierarchical data

But avoid over-nesting (>3 levels) as it complicates queries.
```

### 5. Table Format Selection

#### Raw Parquet vs. Iceberg

**Use Raw Parquet when**:
- Append-only workload
- Schema is stable
- Single writer
- Simple use case
- Cost-sensitive (fewer metadata files)

**Use Iceberg when**:
- Schema evolves frequently
- Need ACID transactions
- Multiple concurrent writers
- Updates/deletes required
- Time travel needed
- Partition evolution needed

**Guidance**:
```
Based on your requirements, I recommend Iceberg:

You mentioned:
- Schema might change (✓ schema evolution)
- Multiple services writing (✓ ACID transactions)
- Need to correct historical data (✓ updates)

Iceberg provides:
- Safe concurrent writes
- Schema evolution without rewriting
- Partition evolution
- Time travel for debugging
- Snapshot isolation

Trade-off: More metadata files and complexity
Benefit: Much better operational characteristics
```

### 6. Retention and Lifecycle

**Pattern**:
```
data/events/
├── hot/           # Last 7 days (frequent access)
│   └── year=2024/month=01/day=08/
├── warm/          # 8-90 days (occasional access)
│   └── year=2024/month=01/day=01/
└── cold/          # >90 days (archival)
    └── year=2023/month=12/
```

**Guidance**:
```
Implement a tiered storage strategy:

HOT (0-7 days):
- ZSTD(3) compression (fast)
- Frequent queries
- Small row groups for low latency

WARM (8-90 days):
- ZSTD(6) compression (balanced)
- Occasional queries
- Standard row groups

COLD (>90 days):
- ZSTD(9) compression (max)
- Rare queries, archival
- Large row groups for storage efficiency
- Consider S3 Glacier for storage class

Automate with lifecycle policies or periodic jobs.
```

## Common Architecture Questions

### Q: How should I organize raw ingestion data?

**Answer**:
```
Organize raw data by ingestion time, not event time:

raw/events/ingestion_date=2024-01-15/hour=14/batch-*.json.gz

Why?
- Simple, predictable
- Matches when data arrives
- Easy retention (delete old ingestion dates)
- Handle late-arriving data naturally

Then in processing, partition by event time:

processed/events/year=2024/month=01/day=14/part-*.parquet
```

### Q: Should I partition by high-cardinality dimension like user_id?

**Answer**:
```
NO! Partitioning by high-cardinality dimensions causes:
- Millions of small directories
- Small files (<1MB)
- Poor performance

Instead:
1. Use hash bucketing: hash(user_id) % 256
2. Or don't partition by user_id at all
3. Use Iceberg with hidden partitioning if needed
4. Let Parquet statistics handle filtering

Partition columns should have <1000 unique values ideally.
```

### Q: How do I handle schema evolution?

**Answer**:
```
Options ranked by difficulty:

1. Iceberg (Recommended):
   - Native schema evolution support
   - Add/rename/delete columns safely
   - Readers handle missing columns

2. Parquet with optional fields:
   - Make new fields optional
   - Old readers ignore new fields
   - New readers handle missing fields as NULL

3. Versioned schemas:
   - events_v1/, events_v2/ directories
   - Manual migration
   - Union views for compatibility

4. Schema-on-read:
   - Store semi-structured (JSON)
   - Parse at query time
   - Flexible but slower
```

### Q: How many partitions is too many?

**Answer**:
```
Rules of thumb:
- <10,000 partitions: Generally fine
- 10,000-100,000: Manageable with tooling
- >100,000: Performance problems

Signs of too many partitions:
- Slow metadata operations (LIST calls)
- Many empty partitions
- Small files (<10MB)

Fix:
- Reduce partition granularity (hourly -> daily)
- Remove unused partition columns
- Implement compaction
- Use Iceberg for better metadata handling
```

### Q: Should I use compression?

**Answer**:
```
Always use compression for cloud storage!

Recommended: ZSTD(3)
- 3-4x compression
- Fast decompression
- Low CPU overhead
- Good for most use cases

For S3/cloud storage, compression:
- Reduces storage costs (70-80% savings)
- Reduces data transfer costs
- Actually improves query speed (less I/O)

Only skip compression for:
- Local development (faster iteration)
- Data already compressed (images, videos)
```
