# Epistemic Checkpoint

Force verification before answering questions involving versions, dates, status, or "current" state.

## Purpose

Prevents the ROOT CAUSE of hallucinations - not just blocking wrong output, but preventing wrong
REASONING. Claude's training data is stale; this skill forces verification before forming beliefs.

## Triggers

Activate this skill when the question involves ANY of:

- Software versions (.NET, Node, React, Python, etc.)
- Release status (preview, LTS, GA, RC, deprecated)
- "Current" or "latest" anything
- Dates that might be after training cutoff
- Package versions
- API deprecations

## MANDATORY Protocol

### Step 1: Recognize Uncertainty

Say to yourself: **"My training data may be stale for: [topic]"**

### Step 2: Check Local Ground Truth

```text
Read ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/blackboard/assertions.yaml
Search for relevant entries
```

If found - use that value with high confidence.

### Step 3: If Not in Assertions - WebSearch

```text
WebSearch("[software] [version] release date site:official-docs")
WebSearch("[software] LTS release 2025")
```

Prefer official sources:

- microsoft.com/dotnet for .NET
- nodejs.org for Node
- python.org for Python

### Step 4: State Verified Facts

Say: **"Based on [source], [software] [version] is [status] as of [date]."**

### Step 5: THEN Proceed

Only now answer the actual question with the verified baseline.

## Red Flag Thoughts (REJECT THESE)

| If you think... | Actually do... |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "I'm pretty sure .NET 10 is..." | WebSearch to verify |
| "This is probably still preview" | Check assertions.yaml |
| "I remember this from training" | Training is stale, verify |
| "This is a simple factual question" | Simple facts are often WRONG |
| "The user said it's preview" | User might be wrong too, verify |

## Anti-Pattern Examples

**WRONG:**

```text
"If targeting .NET 10 preview, use C# 14 extension types..."
```

**CORRECT:**

```text
"Let me verify .NET 10 status... [WebSearch] ...
.NET 10 is LTS (released November 2025), not preview.
Standard extension methods work fine."
```

**WRONG:**

```text
"React 19 is still in beta, so..."
```

**CORRECT:**

```text
"Checking React 19 status... [WebSearch] ...
React 19 was released December 2024 as stable.
Proceeding with React 19 stable patterns."
```

## Common Danger Patterns

| Topic | Danger Pattern | Likely Truth |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| .NET | "preview", "not released" | .NET 10 LTS since Nov 2025 |
| React | "beta", "experimental" | React 19 stable since Dec 2024 |
| Node | "current" without version | Always specify exact version |
| Python | "3.x is latest" | Verify - 3.13+ exists |

## Output Format

When this skill activates, structure your verification as:

```text
Epistemic Checkpoint

Claim to verify: [what you were about to assume]
Source checked: [assertions.yaml / WebSearch / official docs]
Verified fact: [the actual truth]
Confidence: [high/medium/low]

Proceeding with verified baseline...
```
