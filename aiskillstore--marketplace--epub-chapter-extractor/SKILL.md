# EPUB Chapter Extractor

Extract each chapter from an EPUB file into its own markdown file.

## Instructions

When the user wants to extract chapters from an EPUB, run the extraction script with `uv`:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/epub-chapter-extractor && uv run --with ebooklib --with beautifulsoup4 --with html2text --with lxml python extract_chapters.py "/path/to/book.epub" [output_dir]
```

If `output_dir` is omitted, creates a folder named after the EPUB in the same directory.

## Example

User: "Extract chapters from /path/to/mybook.epub"

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/epub-chapter-extractor && uv run --with ebooklib --with beautifulsoup4 --with html2text --with lxml python extract_chapters.py "/path/to/mybook.epub"
```

Output files will be at `/path/to/mybook/`:
- `01_introduction.md`
- `02_chapter_one.md`
- etc.

After extraction, open the output folder:

```bash
open /path/to/mybook
```

## Output Format

Each chapter file contains:

```markdown
# Chapter Title

[Chapter content in markdown format]
```

Files are numbered for proper sorting: `01_`, `02_`, etc.
