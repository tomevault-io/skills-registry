# Executing EPIC Workflow

## 1. Context

- Main Objective: Execute feature development using the EPIC methodology (Explore, Research, Plan, Validate, Implement, Review, Iterate)
- Secondary Objective: Ensure proper delegation to specialized subagents for each phase
- User Input: Feature description, requirements, or task specification
- Workflow: Explore → Research → Plan → Validate Plan → Implement → Review → Iterate (main agent only implements)

### CRITICAL: Session Directory Initialization

**BEFORE starting any EPIC phase, the main agent MUST:**
1. Create session directory: `.claude/sessions/[NN]-[session-description]/`
   - `[NN]`: Two-digit sequential number (01, 02, 03, etc.)
   - `[session-description]`: Short hyphenated description (e.g., user-auth-feature, payment-integration)
2. Store the session directory path for use throughout the workflow
3. **ALWAYS instruct ALL subagents to save their reports to this session directory**

**Example:**
- Session directory: `.claude/sessions/01-user-auth-feature/`
- When delegating to any subagent, ALWAYS include: "Save your report to `.claude/sessions/01-user-auth-feature/[required-filename].md`"

## 2. Workflow

### Phase 1: Explore

**Objective:** Gather comprehensive context about the codebase and existing implementations

- T001: Initialize session directory [P0]
  - Determine next sequential number by checking existing `.claude/sessions/` directories
  - Create new session directory: `.claude/sessions/[NN]-[session-description]/`
  - Example: `.claude/sessions/01-user-auth-feature/`
  - Store this path as `SESSION_DIR` for use in all subsequent phases

- T002: Delegate exploration to `codebase-explorer` agent [P0]
  - **CRITICAL: Include explicit save instruction in delegation prompt:**
    ```
    "Please analyze the current project status, identify relevant files and components,
    assess recent changes and technical dependencies, and document the current state
    of related features.

    IMPORTANT: Save your complete exploration report to:
    [SESSION_DIR]/codebase-status.md

    The report must be saved to this exact location for workflow validation."

- T017: Document implementation completion [P0]
  - Add inline comments where logic isn't self-evident
  - Update relevant documentation files if needed
  - Note any deviations from original plan
  - **CRITICAL: Main agent creates implementation summary:**
    ```
    Save a summary of what was implemented, key decisions made, and any
    deviations from the plan to:
    [SESSION_DIR]/implementation-complete.md

    This file is required for workflow validation.
    ```

- T018: Validate phase completion [P0]
  - Run: `python .claude/skills/epic/scripts/validate-phase.py implement [SESSION_DIR]`
  - **ITERATIVE COMPLIANCE FLOW:**
    - If validation PASSES: Proceed to Phase 6 (Review)
    - If validation FAILS (missing implementation-complete.md):
      1. Main agent creates `[SESSION_DIR]/implementation-complete.md` with summary
      2. Re-run validation script
      3. Repeat until validation passes
    - **CRITICAL:** Do NOT proceed to next phase until validation passes

### Phase 6: Review

**Objective:** Validate implementation quality through specialized review

- T019: Delegate code review to appropriate review agent [P0]
  - **CRITICAL: Include explicit save instruction in delegation prompt:**
    ```
    "Please review the implementation comprehensively. Review the code changes,
    check for code quality, performance, and security issues. Reference the
    implementation summary at [SESSION_DIR]/implementation-complete.md.

    IMPORTANT: Save your complete quality review to:
    [SESSION_DIR]/quality-report.md

    The report must be saved to this exact location for workflow validation.

  - Prioritize issues by severity
  - Prepare for iteration phase if needed

- T022: Validate phase completion [P0]
  - Run: `python .claude/skills/epic/scripts/validate-phase.py review [SESSION_DIR]`
  - **ITERATIVE COMPLIANCE FLOW:**
    - If validation PASSES: Proceed to Phase 7 (Iterate) if issues found, or complete workflow if no issues
    - If validation FAILS:
      1. Reinvoke review agents with EXPLICIT instruction: "Save your report to `[SESSION_DIR]/quality-report.md`"
      2. Re-run validation script
      3. Repeat steps 1-2 until validation passes
    - **CRITICAL:** Do NOT proceed to next phase until validation passes

### Phase 7: Iterate

**Objective:** Address feedback and resolve issues until quality standards are met

- T023: Delegate troubleshooting to `troubleshooter` agent if issues found [P0]
  - **CRITICAL: Include explicit save instruction in delegation prompt if issues exist:**
    ```
    "Please diagnose and resolve the errors/bugs/build failures found in the
    quality report at [SESSION_DIR]/quality-report.md.

    OPTIONAL: If troubleshooting is performed, save your troubleshooting report to:
    [SESSION_DIR]/troubleshooting-report.md

    This file is optional but helpful for documentation."
    ```
  - Diagnose errors, bugs, or build failures
  - Resolve runtime exceptions

  - Read the quality report: `[SESSION_DIR]/quality-report.md`
  - Implement suggested improvements
  - Fix identified issues
  - Update `[SESSION_DIR]/implementation-complete.md` with changes made

- T025: Repeat review phase if significant changes made [P1]
  - If major modifications were implemented, return to Phase 6
  - Ensure changes don't introduce regressions
  - This creates an iteration loop: Review → Iterate → Review until quality passes

- T026: Final verification [P0]
  - Confirm all success criteria from `[SESSION_DIR]/implementation-plan.md` are met
  - Verify no regressions introduced
  - **CRITICAL: Main agent creates final verification summary:**
    ```
    Save a summary confirming all criteria are met, no regressions exist,
    and the implementation is complete to:
    [SESSION_DIR]/final-verification.md

    This file is required for workflow validation.
    ```

- T027: Validate phase completion [P0]
  - Run: `python .claude/skills/epic/scripts/validate-phase.py iterate [SESSION_DIR]`
  - **ITERATIVE COMPLIANCE FLOW:**
    - If validation PASSES: EPIC workflow complete ✅
    - If validation FAILS:
      1. Main agent creates `[SESSION_DIR]/final-verification.md` with summary
      2. Re-run validation script
      3. Repeat until validation passes
    - **CRITICAL:** Do NOT mark workflow complete until validation passes

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### Agent Delegation Pattern

**CRITICAL: ALL delegation prompts MUST include explicit save instructions to SESSION_DIR**

**Phase 1 - Explore:**

- Use `Task` tool with `subagent_type="codebase-explorer"`
- **MUST include in prompt:** "Save your report to `[SESSION_DIR]/codebase-status.md`"
- Provide specific investigation goals
- Request comprehensive analysis of current state

**Phase 2 - Research:**

- Use `Task` tool with `subagent_type="research-specialist"`
- **MUST include in prompt:** "Save your report to `[SESSION_DIR]/research-report.md`"
- Conduct research on complex topics
- Validate approaches across multiple sources

**Phase 3 - Plan:**

- Use `Task` tool with `subagent_type="strategic-planner"`
- **MUST include in prompt:** "Save your plan to `[SESSION_DIR]/implementation-plan.md`"
- Provide paths to previous reports for context
- Analyze problem using exploration and research findings
- Devise optimal solution approaches

**Phase 4 - Validate Plan:**

- Use `Task` tool with `subagent_type="consulting-expert"`
- **MUST include in prompt:** "Save your feedback to `[SESSION_DIR]/validation-feedback.md`"
- Provide path to implementation plan for review
- Review proposed approaches objectively
- Identify risks and suggest alternatives

**Phase 5 - Implement:**

- Main agent executes directly (NO delegation)
- Read plan from `[SESSION_DIR]/implementation-plan.md`
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress
- Follow plan strictly without deviation
- **Main agent MUST save:** `[SESSION_DIR]/implementation-complete.md`
- Ask clarifying questions via AskUserQuestion tool when needed

**Phase 6 - Review:**

- Use `Task` tool with appropriate review agent for code review
- **MUST include in prompt:** "Save your report to `[SESSION_DIR]/quality-report.md`"
- Provide path to implementation summary
- Use `Task` tool with `subagent_type="test-engineer"` for testing validation
- Compile all feedback from review agents

**Phase 7 - Iterate:**

- Use `Task` tool with `subagent_type="troubleshooter"` if issues found (optional)
- Provide path to quality report
- Address review feedback (main agent)
- Return to Phase 6 if significant changes made
- **Main agent MUST save:** `[SESSION_DIR]/final-verification.md`
- Final verification when all checks pass

### Progressive Task Tracking

- Create todo list at start of implementation phase
- Update task status in real-time
- Exactly ONE task in_progress at any time
- Mark tasks completed immediately upon finishing
- Never batch completion updates

### Iterative Compliance Validation

**CRITICAL Pattern: Validate → If Fail → Reinvoke → Repeat**

After EVERY phase, run the validation script:
- `python .claude/skills/epic/scripts/validate-phase.py <phase> <session-dir>`

If validation FAILS:
1. Identify which required file(s) are missing
2. Reinvoke the responsible subagent with explicit instruction to create missing file(s)
3. Re-run validation script
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until validation PASSES
5. **Do NOT proceed to next phase until validation passes**

This iterative flow ensures:
- Subagents complete their assigned tasks
- All required documentation is created
- Compliance is enforced at every phase
- No phase can be skipped or incomplete

### Session Directory Structure

All subagent reports MUST be saved to: `.claude/sessions/[NN]-[session-description]/`

Required files by phase:
- Phase 1 (Explore): `codebase-status.md`
- Phase 2 (Research): `research-report.md`
- Phase 3 (Plan): `implementation-plan.md`
- Phase 4 (Validate): `validation-feedback.md`
- Phase 5 (Implement): `implementation-complete.md`
- Phase 6 (Review): `quality-report.md`
- Phase 7 (Iterate): `final-verification.md`

### Strict Plan Adherence

- Follow the plan exactly as designed
- Do not implement beyond defined scope
- Do not improvise or add unplanned features
- Stop and ask if uncertain about any task
- Simple/lean approach over complex solutions

## 4. Constraints

- **CRITICAL:** Main agent ONLY implements - MUST delegate all other phases (Explore, Research, Plan, Validate, Review, Iterate)
- **CRITICAL:** Follow EXACT phase sequence - Explore → Research → Plan → Validate Plan → Implement → Review → Iterate
- **CRITICAL:** Run validation script after EVERY phase - do NOT proceed until validation PASSES
- **CRITICAL:** If validation fails, MUST reinvoke subagents until they create required files
- **CRITICAL:** Iterative compliance flow is MANDATORY - cannot skip or bypass validation
- **CRITICAL:** All subagent reports MUST be saved to session directory: `.claude/sessions/[NN]-[session-description]/`
- **CRITICAL:** Use TodoWrite tool throughout implementation to track progress
- **CRITICAL:** Follow plan strictly - no deviation or improvisation
- **CRITICAL:** Do not implement tasks beyond the defined scope
- **CRITICAL:** Mark exactly ONE task as in_progress at a time
- **CRITICAL:** Complete tasks immediately upon finishing (no batching)
- Do NOT skip exploration phase - comprehensive context gathering is required
- Do NOT skip research phase - research must happen BEFORE planning
- Do NOT skip planning phase - thorough strategy development is mandatory
- Do NOT skip validation phase - plan must be validated before implementation
- Do NOT skip review phase - validation and code review are essential
- Do NOT skip iteration phase - feedback must be addressed
- Do NOT proceed to next phase if validation fails - reinvoke subagents iteratively
- Do NOT create documentation files unless explicitly requested (except required phase reports)
- Do NOT add emojis unless user explicitly requests them
- Do NOT over-engineer - build for MVP with simple/lean approach
- Do NOT implement features, refactoring, or improvements beyond what was asked
- Only add comments where logic isn't self-evident
- Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Delete unused code completely - no backwards-compatibility hacks
- Ask clarifying questions via AskUserQuestion tool when uncertain
