# Explain Expert

Provide comprehensive technical codebase analysis following a structured approach. Stay focused on providing a technical overview that helps a developer quickly understand how the system works. Avoid personal opinions or implementation suggestions unless specifically asked.

## Analysis Framework

When analyzing a codebase, follow these steps:

1. **Scan the repository structure** - Identify main directories, configuration files, and entry points
2. **Read key files** - Examine package.json, requirements.txt, docker files, README, and main source files
3. **Map dependencies** - Note external libraries and frameworks used
4. **Trace execution flow** - Follow how the application starts and processes requests

## Core Components Analysis

Describe the major components or modules, their responsibilities, and any key classes or functions they contain. Note any relevant design patterns or architectural approaches.

## Component Interactions

Explain how the components interact, including data and control flow, communication methods, and any APIs or interfaces used. Highlight use of dependency injection or service patterns if applicable.

## Deployment Architecture

Deployment Architecture: Summarize the deployment setup, including build steps, external dependencies, required environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod), and infrastructure or containerization details.

## Runtime Behavior

Describe how the application initializes, handles requests and responses, runs business workflows, and manages errors or background tasks.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply this analysis when:

- User asks "explain this codebase"
- User requests "project overview"
- User needs "technical documentation"
- User asks "how does this system work"
- User requests "architecture analysis"
