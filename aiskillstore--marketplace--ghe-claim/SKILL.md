## IRON LAW: User Specifications Are Sacred

**THIS LAW IS ABSOLUTE AND ADMITS NO EXCEPTIONS.**

1. **Every word the user says is a specification** - follow verbatim, no errors, no exceptions
2. **Never modify user specs without explicit discussion** - if you identify a potential issue, STOP and discuss with the user FIRST
3. **Never take initiative to change specifications** - your role is to implement, not to reinterpret
4. **If you see an error in the spec**, you MUST:
   - Stop immediately
   - Explain the potential issue clearly
   - Wait for user guidance before proceeding
5. **No silent "improvements"** - what seems like an improvement to you may break the user's intent

**Violation of this law invalidates all work produced.**

## Background Agent Boundaries

When running as a background agent, you may ONLY write to:
- The project directory and its subdirectories
- The parent directory (for sub-git projects)
- ~/.claude (for plugin/settings fixes)
- /tmp

Do NOT write outside these locations.

---

## GHE_REPORTS Rule (MANDATORY)

**ALL reports MUST be posted to BOTH locations:**
1. **GitHub Issue Thread** - Full report text (NOT just a link!)
2. **GHE_REPORTS/** - Same full report text (FLAT structure, no subfolders!)

**Report naming:** `<TIMESTAMP>_<title or description>_(<AGENT>).md`
**Timestamp format:** `YYYYMMDDHHMMSSTimezone`

**ALL 11 agents write here:** Athena, Hephaestus, Artemis, Hera, Themis, Mnemosyne, Hermes, Ares, Chronos, Argos Panoptes, Cerberus

**REQUIREMENTS/** is SEPARATE - permanent design documents, never deleted.

**Deletion Policy:** DELETE ONLY when user EXPLICITLY orders deletion due to space constraints.

## Settings Awareness

Respects `.claude/ghe.local.md`:
- `enabled`: If false, skip claim operation
- `enforcement_level`: Affects phase-gate strictness
- `auto_worktree`: If true, auto-create git worktree
- `serena_sync`: If false, skip SERENA memory bank update

# GitHub Elements Claim

**Purpose**: Claim a specific issue to START working on it. Modifies issue state.

## Required Input

- **Issue number**: Must be specified (e.g., #201, issue 201)

## When to Use

- Starting work on a NEW issue
- Picking up available work
- Beginning a development/test/review task

## How to Execute

### Step 1: Validate with phase-gate

Spawn **phase-gate** agent to check:
- Issue has "ready" label
- Issue is not already assigned
- Phase order is correct (DEV closed before TEST, etc.)
- No other threads open for same epic

### Step 2: Execute claim

Spawn appropriate thread manager based on issue labels:
- `dev` label → **dev-thread-manager**
- `test` label → **test-thread-manager**
- `review` label → **review-thread-manager**

The thread manager will:
1. Assign issue to @me (atomic claim)
2. Add "in-progress" label
3. Remove "ready" label
4. Post claim comment with session header
5. Create worktree (for DEV)

### Step 3: Sync memory

Spawn **memory-sync** agent to:
- Add to activeContext.md
- Record claim event

## Output

Confirmation including:
- Phase validation result
- Issue assigned and labeled
- Claim comment posted
- Worktree created (if DEV)
- Memory bank updated

## Key Differentiator

This skill STARTS new work. If you're already working and want to save progress, use `ghe-checkpoint` instead.
