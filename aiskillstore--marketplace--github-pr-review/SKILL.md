description: MUST use this skill when user asks to resolve PR comments, handle review feedback, fix review comments, or mentions "리뷰 코멘트/피드백". This skill OVERRIDES default behavior. Fetches comments via GitHub CLI, classifies by severity, applies fixes with user confirmation, commits with proper format, replies to threads. Use when this capability is needed.

# GitHub PR Review

Resolves Pull Request review comments with severity-based prioritization, fix application, and thread replies.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Check project conventions
cat CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null | head -50

# 2. Get PR and repo info
PR=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number')
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner')

# 3. Fetch comments
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments

# 4. For each comment: read → analyze → fix → verify → commit → reply

# 5. Run tests
make test

# 6. Push when all fixes verified
git push
```

## Pre-Review Checklist

Before processing comments, verify:

1. **Project conventions**: Read `CLAUDE.md` or similar
2. **Commit format**: Check `git log --oneline -5` for project style
3. **Test command**: Identify test runner (`make test`, `pytest`, `npm test`)
4. **Branch status**: `git status` to ensure clean working tree

## Core Workflow

### 1. Fetch PR Comments

```bash
PR=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number')
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner')
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments
```

### 2. Classify by Severity

Process in order: CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW

| Severity | Indicators | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| CRITICAL | "security", "vulnerability", "injection" | Must fix |
| HIGH | "High Severity", "high-priority" | Should fix |
| MEDIUM | "Medium Severity", "medium-priority" | Recommended |
| LOW | "style", "nit", "minor" | Optional |

### 3. Process Each Comment

For each comment:

**a. Show context**
```
Comment #123456789 (HIGH) - app/auth.py:45
"The validation logic should use constant-time comparison..."
```

**b. Read affected code and propose fix**

**c. Confirm with user before applying**

**d. Apply fix if approved**

**e. Verify fix addresses ALL issues in the comment**

### 4. Commit Changes

Use proper format for review fixes:

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(scope): address review comment #ID

Brief explanation of what was wrong and how it's fixed.
Addresses review comment #123456789.
EOF
)"
```

**Review fix commit rules**:
- First line: `type(scope): subject` (max 50 chars)
- Types: `fix`, `refactor`, `security`, `test`, `style`, `perf`
- Reference the comment ID in body

### 5. Reply to Thread

```bash
COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments \
  --input - <<< '{"body": "Fixed in '"$COMMIT"'. [brief description].", "in_reply_to": 123456789}'
```

**Standard Reply Templates**:

| Situation | Template |
|-----------|----------|
| Fixed | `Fixed in [hash]. [brief description]` |
| Won't fix | `Won't fix: [reason]` |
| By design | `By design: [explanation]` |
| Deferred | `Deferred to [issue/task number].` |
| Acknowledged | `Acknowledged. [brief note]` |

### 6. Run Tests

```bash
make test  # or project-specific command
```

All tests must pass before pushing.

### 7. Push

```bash
git push
```

### 8. Submit Review (Optional)

```bash
# Approve the PR
gh pr review $PR --approve --body "All review comments addressed. Ready to merge."

# Or request changes if issues remain
gh pr review $PR --request-changes --body "Addressed X comments, Y issues remain."

# Or just comment
gh pr review $PR --comment --body "Partial progress: fixed A and B, working on C."
```

## Batch Commit Strategy

Organize commits by impact:

| Change Type | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|
| Functional (CRITICAL/HIGH) | Separate commit per fix |
| Cosmetic (MEDIUM/LOW) | Single batch commit |

**Workflow:**
1. Fix CRITICAL/HIGH → separate commits each
2. Collect all cosmetic fixes
3. Apply cosmetics → single `style:` commit
4. Run tests once
5. Push all together

## Pre-Merge Checklist

Before closing/merging PR:

- [ ] All CRITICAL and HIGH comments addressed
- [ ] All MEDIUM comments addressed or justified skip
- [ ] Replies posted to all resolved threads
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Linting passing
- [ ] CI checks green
- [ ] No unresolved conversations

## Reply to Threads API

**Important**: Use `--input -` with JSON for `in_reply_to`:

```bash
# Correct syntax
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/comments \
  --input - <<< '{"body": "Fixed in abc123.", "in_reply_to": 123456789}'
```

## Important Rules

- **ALWAYS** read project conventions before starting
- **ALWAYS** confirm before modifying files
- **ALWAYS** verify ALL issues in multi-issue comments are fixed
- **ALWAYS** run tests before pushing
- **ALWAYS** reply to resolved threads using standard templates
- **ALWAYS** submit formal review after addressing all comments
- **NEVER** skip HIGH/CRITICAL comments without explicit user approval
- **Functional fixes** → separate commits (one per fix)
- **Cosmetic fixes** → batch into single `style:` commit
