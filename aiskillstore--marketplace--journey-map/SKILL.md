# Journey Mapping Skill

Map customer journeys to understand end-to-end user experiences, identify pain points, and discover opportunities for improvement.

## When to Use

- Designing new features or flows
- Understanding existing user paths
- Identifying friction points
- Planning improvements
- Stakeholder communication
- Onboarding design

## Journey Map Components

### 1. User Context
- **Persona**: Who is the user?
- **Goal**: What are they trying to accomplish?
- **Trigger**: What initiated this journey?
- **Success**: How do they know they've succeeded?

### 2. Journey Phases

Typical phases to map:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Awareness | User realizes they need something |
| Consideration | User evaluates options |
| Decision | User commits to action |
| Action | User completes the task |
| Retention | User returns or continues |

### 3. Touchpoint Analysis

For each step, document:
- **Action**: What the user does
- **Interface**: What they interact with
- **Thought**: What they're thinking
- **Emotion**: How they feel (frustrated, confident, confused)
- **Pain Point**: What causes friction
- **Opportunity**: How to improve

### 4. Emotion Curve

Map emotional state through the journey:
```
Delighted  ●───────────●
Satisfied      ●───●
Neutral            ●───●
Frustrated             ●───●
Abandoned                  ●
```
