# Memory Management Skill

## Purpose

Guide Claude Code to intentionally capture, store, and use context, decisions, and preferences across sessions, enabling true "memory" that survives context resets and improves over time.

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activates when you mention:
- Remembering user preferences or choices
- Tracking decisions made during development
- Capturing important context
- Learning from user corrections
- Persisting project-specific knowledge
- Memory that survives session resets

## The Problem: Context Loss

**Without intentional memory**:
- ❌ Same mistakes repeated across sessions
- ❌ User has to re-explain preferences every time
- ❌ Important decisions forgotten after context reset
- ❌ No learning from corrections
- ❌ Starting from scratch each session

**With intentional memory**:
- ✅ Preferences remembered and auto-applied
- ✅ Decisions documented and retrievable
- ✅ Context persists across sessions
- ✅ Learn and adapt from corrections
- ✅ Continuous improvement over time

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Be Selective

**Track signal, not noise**:
- ✅ User explicitly states preference ("always use X")
- ✅ User corrects same pattern 2+ times
- ✅ Important architectural decisions
- ✅ Project-specific conventions
- ❌ One-time experiments
- ❌ Formatting preferences (use linter config)
- ❌ Temporary changes
- ❌ Information already in codebase

### 2. Be Transparent

**User should always know what's stored**:
- Store in visible location (`.claude/memory/`)
- Use human-readable format (JSON with comments)
- Provide commands to view memory (`/show-memory`)
- Log when memory is created/updated
- Allow user to clear memory anytime

### 3. Be Intentional

**Only capture what adds value**:
- Preferences that save time
- Decisions that provide context
- Patterns that prevent mistakes
- Knowledge that's hard to rediscover

### 4. Be Respectful

**Never store sensitive data**:
- ❌ API keys, tokens, credentials
- ❌ Personal information (unless necessary)
- ❌ Private repository URLs with tokens
- ❌ Business-sensitive logic
- ✅ Preferences, patterns, conventions
- ✅ Architecture decisions, rationale

---

## What to Remember

### User Preferences

**Examples**:
- Naming conventions (camelCase vs. snake_case)
- Import style (named vs. default)
- Error handling approach (try/catch vs. error boundaries)
- State management choice (Context vs. Zustand vs. TanStack Query)
- Component structure preferences

**Storage location**: `.claude/memory/{skill-name}/preferences.json`

**Example**:
```json
{
  "naming": {
    "convention": "camelCase",
    "learned_from": "user_correction",
    "correction_count": 2,
    "examples": [
      "userId (not user_id)",
      "createdAt (not created_at)"
    ],
    "confidence": "high",
    "last_updated": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Architectural Decisions

**Examples**:
- Why a specific pattern was chosen
- Alternatives considered and rejected
- Trade-offs and constraints
- Future considerations

**Storage location**: `.claude/memory/project/decisions.json`

**Example**:
```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "id": "auth-jwt-2025-01-15",
      "date": "2025-01-15",
      "decision": "Use JWT authentication instead of sessions",
      "rationale": "Need stateless auth for mobile apps",
      "alternatives_considered": [
        "Session-based auth (rejected: not stateless)",
        "OAuth only (rejected: need custom auth flow)"
      ],
      "impact": "Requires database migration for refresh tokens",
      "files_affected": [
        "lib/supabase/auth.ts",
        "app/api/auth/**/*.ts"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Correction Patterns

**Examples**:
- User repeatedly corrects same mistake
- User provides specific guidance
- User rejects suggested approach

**Storage location**: `.claude/memory/{skill-name}/corrections.json`

**Example**:
```json
{
  "corrections": [
    {
      "pattern": "Import style",
      "count": 3,
      "first_seen": "2025-01-10T09:00:00Z",
      "last_seen": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
      "examples": [
        "import { Component } from 'lib' ✓",
        "import Component from 'lib' ✗"
      ],
      "action": "Always use named imports",
      "confidence": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Project Knowledge

**Examples**:
- Tech stack and versions
- Project structure and organization
- Integration points (APIs, databases)
- Deployment patterns

**Storage location**: `.claude/memory/project/knowledge.json`

**Example**:
```json
{
  "tech_stack": {
    "frontend": "Next.js 14, React 19, shadcn/ui, Tailwind",
    "backend": "Supabase Edge Functions, PostgreSQL",
    "deployment": "Vercel (frontend), Supabase (backend)",
    "last_verified": "2025-01-15"
  },
  "structure": {
    "components": "app/components/",
    "pages": "app/(routes)/",
    "api": "app/api/",
    "supabase_functions": "supabase/functions/"
  }
}
```

## When to Persist

### Immediate Persistence

Capture immediately when:
- ✅ User explicitly says "always" or "never"
- ✅ User provides architectural decision with rationale
- ✅ User corrects same pattern for the 2nd time
- ✅ User defines project-specific convention

### Deferred Persistence

Capture after confirmation when:
- User provides preference once (wait for second instance)
- Pattern seems emerging but not confirmed
- Decision has significant impact (confirm first)

### Never Persist

Don't capture:
- ❌ Experimental or temporary changes
- ❌ Information already in code/config
- ❌ Generic best practices (not project-specific)
- ❌ Sensitive data of any kind

---

## Storage Patterns

### Directory Structure

```
.claude/memory/
├── project/
│   ├── knowledge.json          # Tech stack, structure
│   ├── decisions.json          # Architectural decisions
│   └── context.json            # Current feature context
├── {skill-name}/
│   ├── preferences.json        # User preferences for this skill
│   ├── corrections.json        # User corrections tracked
│   └── learned_patterns.json  # Patterns learned over time
└── .gitignore                  # Don't commit sensitive memory
```

### File Format

Use JSON with clear structure:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "created": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "last_updated": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    // Actual content
  }
}
```

### Schema Example

```typescript
interface MemoryEntry {
  version: string;
  created: string;           // ISO timestamp
  last_updated: string;      // ISO timestamp
  expires?: string;          // Optional expiry
  confidence: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  source: 'user_stated' | 'user_correction' | 'inferred';
  data: Record<string, any>;
}
```

## Decision Tracking

### What Makes a Good Decision Log

**Include**:
1. **What**: What was decided
2. **Why**: Rationale and reasoning
3. **When**: Date/time
4. **Alternatives**: What else was considered
5. **Impact**: Files affected, breaking changes
6. **Context**: Current constraints/requirements

**Example Template**:
```markdown
## Decision: [Short Title]

**Date**: 2025-01-15
**Context**: [What problem were we solving?]

**Decision**: [What we decided to do]

**Rationale**:
- [Key reason 1]
- [Key reason 2]

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Option A**: [Why rejected]
- **Option B**: [Why rejected]

**Impact**:
- Files: [List of affected files]
- Breaking: [Yes/No - details]
- Migration: [What needs to change]

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Pro: [Benefit]
- ❌ Con: [Drawback]
```

### When to Log Decisions

**Always log**:
- ✅ Architecture changes (auth, state management, routing)
- ✅ Technology choices (new library, framework change)
- ✅ Breaking changes to APIs or database
- ✅ Deviation from established patterns

**Optional logging**:
- Component structure choices
- File organization changes
- Refactoring approaches

**Don't log**:
- Bug fixes (unless revealing design issue)
- Minor implementation details
- Routine tasks

## Correction Tracking

### Detecting Corrections

User corrections happen when:
1. User explicitly corrects Claude's output
2. User provides same feedback multiple times
3. User rejects suggested approach and provides alternative

### Tracking Pattern

```typescript
interface Correction {
  pattern: string;                    // What's being corrected
  count: number;                      // How many times
  first_seen: string;                 // ISO timestamp
  last_seen: string;                  // ISO timestamp
  examples: string[];                 // Examples of correct/incorrect
  action: string;                     // What to do instead
  threshold: number;                  // Apply after N corrections
  confidence: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}
```

### Auto-Application

After threshold corrections (typically 2-3):
1. Store preference as "high confidence"
2. Auto-apply in future
3. Notify user: "📚 Learned preference from your corrections"
4. Provide way to reset if incorrect

### Example Workflow

```markdown
## First Correction
User: "Use named imports, not default"
Action: Note correction, don't apply yet

## Second Correction (same pattern)
User: "Again, please use named imports"
Action: Log pattern, apply going forward
Notify: "📚 Learned: Always use named imports"

## Future Usage
Claude automatically uses named imports
User can reset with: /clear-memory import-style
```

---

## Context Boundaries

### What Belongs in Memory vs. Code

**In Memory** (`.claude/memory/`):
- Preferences not in code/config
- Decision rationale (the "why")
- Correction patterns
- Temporary feature context

**In Code/Config**:
- Linting rules (ESLint, Prettier)
- Type definitions
- Constants and configuration
- Architecture (visible in structure)

**Rule of Thumb**: If it can be in code, put it in code. Memory is for what code can't capture.

---

## Memory Refresh

### When to Invalidate

Memory should refresh when:
- ✅ Dependencies change (package.json updated)
- ✅ Tech stack changes (new framework adopted)
- ✅ Project structure refactored significantly
- ✅ User explicitly requests reset
- ✅ Memory is stale (> 30 days old, configurable)

### Staleness Detection

```typescript
function isStale(memory: MemoryEntry, maxAge: string): boolean {
  const age = Date.now() - new Date(memory.last_updated).getTime();
  const maxAgeMs = parseAge(maxAge); // "7 days", "30 days"
  return age > maxAgeMs;
}
```

### Refresh Strategies

**Automatic Refresh**:
- Watch critical files (package.json, tsconfig.json)
- Invalidate related memory on change
- Re-scan and update

**Manual Refresh**:
```bash
/refresh-memory              # Refresh all
/refresh-memory [skill]      # Refresh specific skill
/clear-memory [skill]        # Clear and start fresh
```

---

## Best Practices

### DO ✅

1. **Log important decisions with rationale**
2. **Track user corrections (2+ times = pattern)**
3. **Store in human-readable format (JSON)**
4. **Provide user control (view/clear commands)**
5. **Include timestamps and confidence levels**
6. **Refresh memory when dependencies change**
7. **Notify user when learning from corrections**

### DON'T ❌

1. **Don't store sensitive data**
2. **Don't persist everything (be selective)**
3. **Don't assume memory is always valid (check staleness)**
4. **Don't make memory opaque (user should understand)**
5. **Don't persist what belongs in code**
6. **Don't keep stale memory indefinitely**

---

## Commands for Memory Management

Provide these commands to users:

```bash
# View memory
/show-memory                  # Show all memory
/show-memory [skill]          # Show specific skill memory

# Clear memory
/clear-memory [skill]         # Clear specific skill
/clear-all-memory             # Clear everything (confirm first)

# Refresh memory
/refresh-memory               # Refresh all memory
/refresh-memory [skill]       # Refresh specific skill

# Export/backup
/export-memory                # Export for backup
/import-memory [file]         # Restore from backup
```

---

## Integration with Other Skills

### With context-persistence Skill

Memory management stores **preferences and patterns**.
Context persistence stores **current task state**.

**Example**:
- Memory: "User prefers named imports" (permanent)
- Context: "Currently implementing auth feature" (temporary)

### With plan-approval Skill

Memory management stores **approved decisions**.
Plan approval handles **future decisions requiring approval**.

**Example**:
- Memory: "JWT auth was approved on 2025-01-15"
- Plan: "Proposing addition of OAuth - needs approval"

---

## Example: Complete Memory Management Workflow

### Scenario: User Corrects Import Style Twice

**First Correction**:
```
User: "Please use named imports instead of default"
Claude: ✓ Fixed import style
Action: Log correction in memory (count: 1)
```

**Second Correction** (same pattern):
```
User: "Again, use named imports"
Claude: ✓ Fixed import style
Action: Mark as learned pattern (count: 2)
Notify: "📚 Learned preference: Always use named imports"
Storage: .claude/memory/project/preferences.json
```

**Future Usage**:
```
Claude automatically uses named imports
User sees: "✓ Using your preferred import style (named imports)"
```

**User Can Reset**:
```
User: /clear-memory import-style
Claude: ✓ Cleared import style preference
```

---

## Privacy & Security

### What to Store

✅ **Safe**:
- Code preferences (naming, structure)
- Architecture decisions (patterns, approaches)
- Correction patterns
- Project knowledge (tech stack, structure)

❌ **Never Store**:
- API keys, tokens, credentials
- Personal information
- Sensitive business logic
- Private URLs with tokens

### User Control

**Transparency**:
- Memory files in visible location
- Human-readable format
- Clear documentation of what's stored

**Control**:
- View memory anytime
- Clear memory anytime
- Export/backup memory
- Memory not committed to git (add to .gitignore)

---

## Summary

**Memory management enables Claude Code to**:
1. ✅ Remember user preferences across sessions
2. ✅ Learn from corrections and adapt
3. ✅ Document decisions with rationale
4. ✅ Provide continuity across context resets
5. ✅ Improve over time without user repetition

**Key principle**: Be selective, transparent, intentional, and respectful of user privacy.

**Storage**: `.claude/memory/` directory with JSON files

**Commands**: `/show-memory`, `/clear-memory`, `/refresh-memory`

Use this skill to make Claude Code feel like it truly "remembers" your project!
