# Plan-Approval Skill

## Purpose

Enable user control over AI actions by requiring explicit approval for complex or risky changes, preventing mistakes and ensuring alignment with user intent.

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activates when you mention:
- Creating or reviewing plans
- Approval or confirmation needed
- Proposed changes or approach
- Want to see plan before execution
- Complex or risky operations
- Need user sign-off

## The Problem: No User Control

**Without plan approval**:
- ❌ AI jumps straight to implementation
- ❌ No chance to review approach
- ❌ Mistakes expensive to undo
- ❌ User left out of decision process
- ❌ No learning from rejections

**With plan approval**:
- ✅ User reviews before execution
- ✅ Can modify or reject approach
- ✅ Prevents costly mistakes
- ✅ User maintains control
- ✅ AI learns from feedback

---

## Core Principles

### 1. User is Always in Control

**Never execute without approval for**:
- Database schema changes
- Breaking API changes
- Dependency updates
- Architecture refactors
- File deletions
- Deployment actions

### 2. Plans are Detailed

**Good plans include**:
- What will be done (specific files/changes)
- Why this approach (rationale)
- What alternatives were considered
- What risks exist
- What the impact is
- How long it will take

### 3. Approval is Explicit

**Require clear user response**:
- ✅ "approve", "yes", "proceed", "looks good"
- ❌ Silence, vague response, "maybe"
- ⚠️ "modify: [changes]" triggers plan revision

### 4. Learning from Feedback

**Track approved/rejected plans**:
- Store approved approaches (do more like this)
- Store rejected approaches (avoid in future)
- Learn user preferences over time

---

## When to Require Approval

### Always Require Approval

✅ **Database changes**:
- Schema migrations
- RLS policy changes
- Data migrations
- Index additions

✅ **Breaking changes**:
- API signature changes
- Function signature changes
- Component prop changes

✅ **Architecture changes**:
- New dependencies
- Framework changes
- State management approach
- Routing structure

✅ **Risky operations**:
- File deletions
- Bulk updates
- Production deployments

### Optional Approval

⚠️ **Complex features** (> 5 files affected)
⚠️ **Refactoring** (multiple components)
⚠️ **Performance optimization** (cache strategies)

### No Approval Needed

❌ **Simple changes**:
- Bug fixes (< 10 lines)
- Documentation updates
- Code formatting
- Minor UI tweaks

**Rule of Thumb**: If user might say "wait, not like that!", require approval.

## Approval

**Reply with**:
- `approve` - Proceed with this plan
- `reject` - Cancel, don't proceed
- `modify: [your changes]` - Adjust plan first

```

---

## Approval Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Plan

```markdown
User: "Add Stripe payment integration"

Claude:
"I'll create a plan for Stripe integration first.

[Generates detailed plan using template]

Review the plan above. Reply:
- 'approve' to proceed
- 'reject' to cancel
- 'modify: [changes]' to adjust
"
```

### Step 2: Wait for Explicit Approval

**Valid approvals**:
- "approve"
- "yes, proceed"
- "looks good"
- "go ahead"
- "lgtm" (looks good to me)

**Modifications**:
- "modify: use Stripe Checkout instead of Elements"
- "change: store payment methods in Supabase"
- "add: webhook handling"

**Rejections**:
- "reject"
- "no"
- "cancel"
- "let's do something different"

### Step 3: Execute or Revise

**If approved**:
1. Save plan to `.claude/memory/plans/approved/`
2. Execute implementation
3. Track progress in dev docs
4. Mark complete when done

**If modified**:
1. Update plan with user's changes
2. Re-present revised plan
3. Wait for approval again

**If rejected**:
1. Save to `.claude/memory/plans/rejected/` with reason
2. Learn from rejection
3. Don't proceed

### Step 4: Track Execution

```markdown
## Plan Execution Status

**Plan ID**: stripe-integration-2025-01-15
**Status**: In Progress
**Approved**: 2025-01-15 10:00
**Started**: 2025-01-15 10:05

**Progress**:
- [x] Step 1: Install Stripe SDK
- [x] Step 2: Create Stripe client
- [ ] Step 3: Implement checkout flow (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Step 4: Add webhook handler
- [ ] Step 5: Test payment flow

**Current**: Implementing checkout flow in app/api/checkout/route.ts
**Next**: Add webhook handler for payment events
```

## Learning from Plans

### Track Approval Patterns

```json
{
  "approval_patterns": {
    "stripe_payments": {
      "preferred_approach": "Stripe Checkout (not Elements)",
      "storage": "Supabase tables",
      "reason": "User approved this twice, rejected Elements once",
      "confidence": "high"
    },
    "database_changes": {
      "requires_approval": true,
      "wants_rollback_plan": true,
      "prefers_separate_migration_file": true,
      "confidence": "high"
    }
  }
}
```

### Apply Learnings

**Future similar requests**:
```markdown
User: "Add subscription billing"

Claude:
"Based on previous approvals, I'll plan to use:
- Stripe Checkout (you preferred this over Elements)
- Supabase tables for subscription state
- Separate webhook handler

[Presents plan following learned preferences]
```

### Track Rejections

```json
{
  "rejections": [
    {
      "plan_id": "complex-state-management-2025-01-10",
      "reason": "Too complex, prefer simpler approach",
      "rejected_approach": "Redux Toolkit",
      "preferred_instead": "React Context",
      "lesson": "User prefers simpler solutions when possible"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Plan Deviations

### When Implementation Differs from Plan

**Acceptable deviations**:
- Minor implementation details
- Better solution discovered
- Library API changed

**Require new approval**:
- Different architecture approach
- More files affected than planned
- Additional dependencies
- Higher risk than estimated

### Handling Deviations

```markdown
User: "Continue with Stripe integration"

Claude:
"⚠️ PLAN DEVIATION DETECTED

**Original plan**: Use Stripe Elements
**Current need**: Stripe Checkout is better for our use case

**Reason**: Elements requires more frontend work, Checkout is simpler

**Impact**:
- Different files affected
- Simpler implementation
- Less custom UI needed

**Do you approve this deviation?**
- 'yes' - Proceed with Checkout
- 'no' - Stick to original plan
- 'revise' - Create new plan
"
```

---

## Commands

Provide these commands:

```bash
# Create plan
/create-plan [feature-name]       # Generate plan for approval

# Review plans
/show-plans                       # Show all plans
/show-plan [plan-id]              # Show specific plan

# Approve/reject
/approve [plan-id]                # Approve a plan
/reject [plan-id]                 # Reject a plan

# Track progress
/plan-status [plan-id]            # Show execution progress

# History
/approved-plans                   # Show approved plans
/rejected-plans                   # Show rejected (learn from these)
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### With memory-management

**memory-management** stores long-term preferences.
**plan-approval** handles one-time decisions.

**Example**:
- Memory: "User always prefers TypeScript" (permanent)
- Plan: "Use Stripe Checkout for payments" (this feature)

### With context-persistence

**context-persistence** tracks implementation progress.
**plan-approval** handles pre-implementation planning.

**Workflow**:
1. Plan approval: Generate and approve plan
2. Context persistence: Track implementation in dev docs
3. Memory: Store outcome and learnings

---

## Best Practices

### DO ✅

1. **Present clear, detailed plans**
2. **Wait for explicit approval**
3. **Track plan execution progress**
4. **Learn from approvals and rejections**
5. **Notify user of deviations**
6. **Store plans for future reference**
7. **Include rollback strategy for risky changes**

### DON'T ❌

1. **Don't skip approval for complex changes**
2. **Don't assume silence means approval**
3. **Don't deviate significantly without asking**
4. **Don't forget to track approved plans**
5. **Don't make plans too vague**
6. **Don't proceed if user is uncertain**

---

## Example: Complete Plan-Approval Flow

### User Request

```
User: "Add Stripe subscription billing to the app"
```

### Plan Generation

```markdown
Claude: "I'll create a detailed plan for Stripe subscriptions.

# Stripe Subscription Billing Plan

## Summary
Add Stripe subscription billing with monthly/yearly plans, customer portal, and webhook handling.

## What Will Change

### Files to Create (5)
1. `lib/stripe/client.ts` - Stripe client initialization
2. `lib/stripe/subscriptions.ts` - Subscription management
3. `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` - Webhook handler
4. `app/api/checkout/route.ts` - Checkout session creation
5. `app/pricing/page.tsx` - Pricing page

### Files to Modify (3)
1. `package.json` - Add stripe package
2. `.env.example` - Add Stripe keys
3. `lib/supabase/schema.sql` - Add subscriptions table

### Database Changes
**Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20250115_subscriptions.sql`
- Table: `subscriptions` (user_id, stripe_subscription_id, status, plan_id)
- Table: `subscription_plans` (name, price, interval)
- RLS policies for subscription access

## Why This Approach
- Stripe Checkout: Hosted, PCI-compliant, less frontend work
- Webhooks: Reliable payment event handling
- Supabase storage: Sync subscription state with user data

## Alternatives Considered
- **Stripe Elements**: More control but more work. Rejected: Overkill for MVP
- **Manual billing**: Can't scale. Rejected: Need automation

## Risks
- ⚠️ Webhook reliability: Mitigate with retry logic + monitoring
- ⚠️ State sync: Mitigate with idempotent webhook handlers

## Estimated Time
- Implementation: 3 hours
- Testing: 1 hour
- **Total**: 4 hours

---

**Do you approve this plan?**
Reply: 'approve', 'modify: [changes]', or 'reject'
```

### User Approval

```
User: "approve"
```

### Execution

```markdown
Claude: "✅ Plan approved. Starting implementation.

Saving plan to: .claude/memory/plans/approved/stripe-subscriptions-2025-01-15.json

Creating dev docs: /create-plan stripe-subscriptions

Starting with Step 1: Install Stripe SDK..."

[Proceeds with implementation while tracking progress]
```

### Completion

```markdown
Claude: "✅ Stripe subscription billing complete!

**Completed**:
- ✅ All 5 files created
- ✅ Database migration applied
- ✅ Webhooks tested with Stripe CLI
- ✅ Checkout flow working

**Time**: 3.5 hours (30 min under estimate)

Marking plan as completed.
Storing lessons learned:
- Stripe Checkout works well for subscriptions
- Webhook testing critical (caught 2 bugs)
```

---

## Summary

**Plan-approval workflow enables**:
1. ✅ User control over AI actions
2. ✅ Prevention of costly mistakes
3. �� Clear communication of approach
4. ✅ Learning from user feedback
5. ✅ Transparent decision making

**Key steps**:
1. Generate detailed plan
2. Wait for explicit approval
3. Execute or revise based on feedback
4. Track progress
5. Learn from outcome

**Storage**: `.claude/memory/plans/` with status tracking

**Commands**: `/create-plan`, `/approve`, `/reject`, `/show-plans`

**Rule**: Always require approval for complex, risky, or breaking changes!

Use this skill to ensure Claude Code never acts without your explicit permission for important changes.
