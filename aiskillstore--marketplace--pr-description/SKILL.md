## File Creation (Optional)

If saving the PR description to a file:
- **Pattern**: `pr_description_<descriptive_title>_<timestamp>.md`
- **Get timestamp**: `date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S"`
- **Example**: `pr_description_user_auth_refactor_20250612_152832.md`

### Data Flow Diagram
Show the complete flow of data or logic:
- Input sources
- Processing steps
- Output destinations
- Include a colour-coded legend

### Entity Relationship Diagram (When Applicable)
Show object/data relationships:
- Primary keys (PK)
- Foreign keys (FK)
- Relationship cardinality (one-to-many, many-to-many)

## Content Guidelines

### Summary Section
- Explain business context briefly
- Highlight key benefits
- Keep it to 2-3 sentences

### Changes Section
- Focus on what matters to reviewers
- Group related changes together
- Note any breaking changes prominently

### Testing Section
- **ALWAYS include exact commands run**
- Show evidence of successful tests
- Include validation results
- Add screenshots when helpful

### Future Work Section
- List intentionally deferred items
- Suggest optimisations or enhancements
- Note any technical debt created

## Key Principles

1. **Be specific**: Include exact commands, concrete examples
2. **Show evidence**: Screenshots, command outputs, test results
3. **Think reviewer-first**: What would a reviewer need to understand the changes?
4. **Business context**: Explain the "why" not just the "what"
5. **Keep it scannable**: Use headers, bullet points, and formatting

## Good Examples

### Good Summary
"This PR refactors the user authentication flow to use JWT tokens instead of session cookies. The change improves scalability for our microservices architecture and reduces server-side session storage requirements."

### Good Testing Description
```bash
# Commands run
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run lint
```

**Results:**
- ✅ 47 unit tests passed
- ✅ 12 integration tests passed
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Manual testing completed on staging environment

## Error Handling

- If unable to determine scope of changes, ask user for clarification
- If testing hasn't been completed, remind user to run tests first
- If no diagrams provided, create placeholder diagrams and ask user to review
