# Pre-Client Identity Skill

## Overview

The Pre-Client Identity Skill is the **incoming lead intelligence engine**. It:
- Ingests and analyzes incoming emails automatically
- Extracts sender company, role, and background
- Clusters related messages into conversation threads
- Detects buying signals and business problems
- Builds relationship timelines for each prospect
- Surfaces high-potential opportunities for follow-up

Think of it as an AI that watches your inbox and alerts you when someone valuable walks in the door.

## Core Capabilities

```

### 2. Thread Clustering & Organization

**Automatic conversation grouping:**

```
CLUSTERING ALGORITHM:
Groups emails into conversations based on:
1. Same sender + same company
2. Same topic/problem domain
3. Time proximity (within 2 weeks suggests related)
4. Reply-to-reply chains (email threading)

EXAMPLE CLUSTERED THREAD:

From: sarah.chen@techstartup.io
Subject: "Looking for better project management solution"
[Initial inquiry]

```

### 3. Buying Signals Detection

**Identifies high-intent indicators:**

```
TIER 1: HIGHEST INTENT (Act immediately)
Signal: "We need to migrate by Q1"
Signal: "We've allocated budget for this"
Signal: "We're evaluating vendors this month"
Signal: "Your solution solves problem X that's costing us $Y"
Signal: "When can you start implementation?"
Signal: "Can you do a demo tomorrow?"
Action: Schedule call immediately

TIER 2: HIGH INTENT (Respond within hours)
Signal: "We're looking for a solution like yours"
Signal: "Our current tool doesn't support feature X"
Signal: "How much does this cost?"
Signal: "Can you send pricing and case studies?"
Signal: "Tell me more about your solution"
Signal: "Does this integrate with [their tools]?"
Action: Respond with valuable information

TIER 3: MODERATE INTENT (Follow up within 24 hours)
Signal: "We might be interested in the future"
Signal: "Just exploring options"
Signal: "Can you add me to your mailing list?"
Signal: "Do you have any case studies?"
Signal: "What's your free trial period?"
Action: Provide resources, nurture

TIER 4: LOW INTENT (Add to nurture sequence)
Signal: "Just curious what you do"
Signal: "We're not looking to change right now"
Signal: "Can I learn more about your company?"
Signal: "Interesting product, thanks for sharing"
Action: Long-term nurture, stay in touch

EXAMPLE SIGNALS IN CONTEXT:

Email: "We have budget allocated for this in Q1"
Tier: 1 (HIGHEST)
Reasoning: Budget allocated = money reserved
Action: Call them before competitors do

Email: "How long is your implementation timeline?"
Tier: 1-2 (HIGH)
Reasoning: Specific implementation question = ready to execute
Action: Provide detailed timeline, case study

Email: "Can you send us pricing?"
Tier: 2 (HIGH)
Reasoning: Asking about price = considering buying
Action: Send pricing + case study showing ROI

Email: "What do you charge?"
Tier: 2-3 (MODERATE-HIGH)
Reasoning: Price question, but phrased casually
Action: Respond quickly with pricing framework

Email: "Just browsing your website"
Tier: 4 (LOW)
Reasoning: No specific problem mentioned
Action: Add to nurture, wait for signal
```

### 4. Business Problem Detection

**Identifies pain points and opportunity triggers:**

```
OPPORTUNITY TYPES:

1. TOOL REPLACEMENT
Signal: "Our current [tool] isn't meeting our needs"
Problem: Existing solution inadequate
Opportunity: Replace with your solution
Timeline: Usually 4-8 weeks
Approach: Comparison guide, migration support

Example:
"We use Monday.com but it doesn't support our workflow"
→ You have project management solution
→ Create comparison: Monday.com vs. Your tool
→ Highlight features they specifically need
→ Timeline: Could migrate in Q1

2. PROCESS PAIN
Signal: "We're struggling with [process]"
Problem: Manual process, inefficiency
Opportunity: Automate with your solution
Timeline: Depends on complexity
Approach: ROI calculator, process improvement plan

Example:
"We spend 20 hours/week on manual status reports"
→ Your solution automates reporting
→ Calculate time savings: 20 hrs/week × 50 weeks = 1,000 hrs = $50k/year
→ ROI: Huge
→ Timeline: 30-60 days

3. GROWTH BLOCKER
Signal: "We can't scale because [reason]"
Problem: Current setup can't support growth
Opportunity: Enable growth with your solution
Timeline: Urgent (growth is happening now)
Approach: Growth strategy, capacity planning

Example:
"We can't onboard more clients because we can't manage them"
→ Your solution supports unlimited clients
→ Calculate revenue impact: Each client = $10k/year
→ For every 10 clients: $100k new revenue
→ Timeline: URGENT - do this month

4. COMPETITIVE THREAT
Signal: "Competitor X has feature Y"
Problem: Falling behind in market
Opportunity: Close gap with your solution
Timeline: Medium urgency
Approach: Competitive comparison, feature roadmap

Example:
"Competitor is offering integration we don't have"
→ Your solution has that integration
→ Risk: Losing customers to competitor
→ Timeline: 6-8 weeks to close gap

5. TEAM/WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENT
Signal: "Our team would work better if [feature]"
Problem: Suboptimal workflows
Opportunity: Improve team productivity with your solution
Timeline: Medium term
Approach: Workflow assessment, ROI analysis

Example:
"Our team spends too much time in meetings coordinating"
→ Your solution has better collaboration features
→ Benefit: Fewer meetings, more focus time
→ Productivity gain: 5 hours/person/week = $10k/year for 10 people
```
