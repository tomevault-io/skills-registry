# Semantic Code Hunter (Powered by Serena MCP)

## When to Use
- "Where do we handle X?" questions
- Finding authentication flows
- Locating validation logic
- Multi-file refactoring
- Understanding component relationships
- Finding all usages of a symbol
- Tracing dependencies

## When NOT to Use
- Small projects (< 10 files) - use Grep instead
- Simple text searches - use Grep instead
- Single-file edits - use Read instead
- You already know the exact file

## How It Works
Uses Serena MCP tools for semantic understanding:
- `find_symbol` - Find symbols by concept, not just name
- `find_referencing_symbols` - Trace code relationships
- `find_referencing_code_snippets` - Find where code is used
- `get_symbols_overview` - Understand file structure first
- Token-efficient (70% savings vs traditional search)

## Serena Tools Available

### find_symbol
Find symbols globally or locally with/containing a given name/substring.
```
Example: find_symbol("authenticate")
Finds: authenticateUser, isAuthenticated, AuthenticationService
```

### find_referencing_symbols
Find symbols that reference another symbol.
```
Example: find_referencing_symbols("User", type="function")
Finds: All functions that use the User model
```

### get_symbols_overview
Get high-level overview of symbols in a file.
```
Example: get_symbols_overview("src/services/auth.ts")
Returns: List of classes, functions, exports in file
```

### search_for_pattern
Pattern search across project (when semantic search not sufficient).

## Usage Pattern

### Step 1: Start with Overview
```
If you know the file:
1. get_symbols_overview("path/to/file.ts")
2. Identify relevant symbols
3. Use find_symbol to get details
```

### Step 2: Semantic Search
```
If you don't know the file:
1. find_symbol("concept")
2. Review results
3. Use find_referencing_symbols to trace usage
```

### Step 3: Targeted Retrieval
```
Once you know what you need:
1. Use find_symbol to get specific code
2. Only loads relevant sections (not entire files)
3. Minimal token consumption
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Find Authentication Flow
```
Task: "Where do we handle user authentication?"

Process:
1. find_symbol("auth") - Find auth-related symbols
2. Identify: authenticateUser, validateToken, etc.
3. find_referencing_symbols("authenticateUser") - Where is it called?
4. Trace the flow: Login route → Auth service → JWT generation

Result: Complete authentication flow mapped without reading full files
```

### Example 2: Multi-file Refactoring
```
Task: "Rename User model to Account"

Process:
1. find_symbol("User") - Find User model
2. find_referencing_symbols("User") - Find all usages
3. List all files that need updating
4. Use rename_symbol (Serena tool) for safe refactoring

Result: All references found and renamed consistently
```

### Example 3: Understanding Component Relationships
```
Task: "How does ProjectCard component get data?"

Process:
1. find_symbol("ProjectCard")
2. find_referencing_symbols("ProjectCard") - Where is it used?
3. Trace backwards to data source
4. Understand the data flow

Result: Complete data flow from API → Page → Component
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, narrow down**
   - Use find_symbol with general terms first
   - Filter results by type (function, class, interface)
   - Then get specific symbol details

2. **Use type filters**
   - type="function" - Only functions
   - type="class" - Only classes
   - type="interface" - Only interfaces

3. **Leverage symbol relationships**
   - find_referencing_symbols shows dependencies
   - Helps understand impact of changes
   - Reveals architectural patterns

4. **Combine with traditional tools**
   - Serena for semantic understanding
   - Grep for simple text matches
   - Read for config files, documentation

## Token Efficiency

Traditional approach (without Serena):
1. Read entire files → 10,000+ tokens
2. Multiple grep iterations → 5,000+ tokens
3. Manual analysis → High cognitive load

Serena approach:
1. find_symbol → 200 tokens
2. Targeted retrieval → 500 tokens
3. Total: ~700 tokens (93% savings)

## Troubleshooting

**If Serena returns too many results:**
- Add type filter: type="function"
- Use more specific search term
- Check specific file with get_symbols_overview first

**If Serena returns no results:**
- Check spelling (case-sensitive)
- Try broader search term
- Fall back to Grep for text search
- Ensure Serena is indexed (run: serena project index)

**If symbols missing:**
- Re-index project: serena project index
- Check if file is in .gitignore
- Verify language server supports file type
