**Goal**: Create comprehensive PRDs, tech specs, and ux specs based on feature requirements

## Dependency Chain

```
app-vision.md → prd.md → tech-specs.md → ux.md
```

## Workflow

- T001: Read and analyze the appropriate template in `.claude/skills/specs-creator/templates/` for structure compliance
- T002: Analyze feature requirements
- T003: Choose the the appropriate instructions in the `.claude/skills/specs-creator/instructions/`
- T003: Execute the instructions
- T004: Run Validation Scripts in `.claude/skills/specs-creator/scripts/`
- T005: Provide comprehensive report to user with specs details, location, and usage guidance

## Prohibited Tasks

- NEVER create a spec if its dependency doesn't exist yet (see Dependency Chain)
- NEVER write or modify actual code implementation
- NEVER overwrite existing specs without explicit user approval
- DO NOT make architectural decisions beyond documentation scope
- NEVER skip template compliance validation
- DO NOT create specs outside designated `specs/` directory
- NEVER assume requirements without user clarification

## Success Criteria

- All specs follow the template structure in `.claude/skills/specs-creator/templates/`
- Feature requirements are fully captured with no ambiguity
- Validation scripts pass without errors
- Specs are saved to correct location in `specs/`
- User receives clear report with file location and usage guidance

## Template Paths

- **PRD** `.claude/skills/specs-creator/templates/prd.md`
- **Tech Specs** `.claude/skills/specs-creator/templates/tech-specs.md`
- **UX Specs** `.claude/skills/specs-creator/templates/ux.md`
