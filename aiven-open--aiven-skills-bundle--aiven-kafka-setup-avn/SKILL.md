# Aiven Kafka Setup (avn CLI)

End-to-end workflow for creating an Apache Kafka service on **Aiven** using the `avn` CLI,
with SASL_SSL authentication, Avro Schema Registry, and a **working** Java or Python
producer/consumer example that reads from CSV and writes to Kafka.

> **IMPORTANT**: This skill ALWAYS creates a fully working example (Java by default).
> Steps 1–3 are all mandatory. Never stop after creating the service — you MUST also
> build the example project, generate test data, and run the producer + consumer
> end-to-end.

---

## Step 1: Prerequisites

### 1.1 Verify avn CLI login

Run the following to check if the user is logged in:

```bash
avn user info
```

**If the command fails**, inspect the error and guide the user accordingly:

```
If the error contains "Expired db token":

  Your Aiven login token expired. Please run:
  avn user login <your-email>

If the error contains "ERROR: Not logged in" or "UserError: not authenticated":

  You are not logged in to the Aiven CLI. Please run:
  avn user login <your-email>

  If you are a new user, create an account via:
  https://console.aiven.io/login

Then confirm when you are logged in.
```

**STOP and wait** for the user to confirm login before proceeding.

### 1.2 Required tools

Verify the following are installed:
- `avn` (Aiven CLI) - At least version 4.7.0 or later is required.
- `jq` (JSON processing)
- For Java: `java` (17+), `mvn`
- For Python: `python3` (3.9+), `pip`

Before creating a service, ask the customer to confirm they have enough credits (they can check with):

```bash
avn project details --json
```

Use the AskQuestion tool to collect this confirmation without interrupting the flow.

**AI Agent MUST NOT check credits itself.** Only the customer should run the credit-check command and confirm.

**Missing Requirements Policy:**
- If a library or CLI tool (like `avn`) is missing, advise the user on how to install it (e.g., `python3 -m pip install aiven-client` for `avn`). However, check first if `python3` is available before suggesting a `pip` command.
- If a core language runtime (`python3` or `java`) is requested but missing, **interrupt the flow immediately**. Do NOT advise the user on how to install programming languages.

---

## Step 2: Create the Kafka Service and Export Environment Variables

Follow **[SERVICE_CREATION_AVN.md](SERVICE_CREATION_AVN.md)** sections 1–4 in order:

1. **Choose a service name (if missing)** — if the customer did not provide a service name, use AskQuestion with:
   - `aiven-kafka-service-test`
   - `Other` (if selected, ask the customer to provide their custom service name)
2. **Choose a region** — ask the user with AskQuestion, mapping their choice to the **EXACT** `CLOUD_NAME` from the table in **[SERVICE_CREATION_AVN.md](SERVICE_CREATION_AVN.md)**.
3. **Choose a plan** — default `developer-2-1d`; **never** use `free-0` or `startup-2`.
4. **Run the setup script** — a single command creates the service, tags it with
   `AI-skill-generated=true`, creates users and ACLs, registers the schema,
   extracts all connection details, and writes them to `env.sh`.
   - If service creation returns `Payment method is not set and there is not enough credits for the service`,
     the script fails fast and the flow must stop immediately.
5. **Source `env.sh`** — loads `KAFKA_HOST`, `KAFKA_PORT`, `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL`,
   `AVNADMIN_PASS`, `PRODUCER_PASSWORD`, `CONSUMER_PASSWORD` into the shell.

```bash
bash scripts/setup_aiven_kafka.sh <name> <CLOUD_NAME> <plan> 4.1
source env.sh
```

> **CRITICAL**: Do NOT read or cat `env.sh` in the agent context — it contains
> passwords. Only `source` it and verify passwords by `${#VAR}` (length).

---

## Step 3: Create and Run the Working Example

> **MANDATORY**: This step is NOT optional. After the Kafka service is running and
> environment variables are exported, you MUST create a working producer/consumer
> example, compile/install it, generate test data, and run it end-to-end.
> **Default language is Java** unless the user explicitly requests Python.

### 3.1 Ask the user which language to use

Use the AskQuestion tool:

```
Prompt: "Which language for the producer/consumer example?"
Options:
  - Java (default, recommended)
  - Python
```

If the user requests a language other than Java or Python, warn them:

> "Results with languages other than Java or Python are unpredictable. It is recommended
> to use Java or Python for reliable results."

**If the user does not answer or skips**, default to **Java**.

### 3.2 Copy templates into the workspace

The templates live under this skill's `templates/` directory. They MUST be copied to
the **workspace root** so the run scripts can find them at the expected relative paths.

```bash
# Copy from the skill directory into the workspace root
cp -r <SKILL_DIR>/templates/ <WORKSPACE_ROOT>/templates/
cp -r <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/  <WORKSPACE_ROOT>/scripts/
```

After copying, verify the files exist:

```bash
ls templates/order.avsc
ls templates/producer_consumer_java/Producer.java   # if Java
ls templates/producer_consumer_python/producer.py    # if Python
ls scripts/run_producer.sh scripts/run_consumer.sh
```

### 3.3 Generate test data

Run the data generator (no external dependencies):

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_orders.py
```

This creates `orders.csv` with 20 rows in the format `id,user_id,product,price`.
**Verify it was created:**

```bash
wc -l orders.csv   # should show 21 (1 header + 20 data rows)
```

### 3.4 Build the project

#### Java (default)

Set up the Maven source tree and compile:

```bash
JAVA_DIR="templates/producer_consumer_java"
mkdir -p "$JAVA_DIR/src/main/java/com/aiven/demo"
cp "$JAVA_DIR/Producer.java" "$JAVA_DIR/src/main/java/com/aiven/demo/"
cp "$JAVA_DIR/Consumer.java" "$JAVA_DIR/src/main/java/com/aiven/demo/"
cp "$JAVA_DIR/Order.java"    "$JAVA_DIR/src/main/java/com/aiven/demo/"
mvn -f "$JAVA_DIR/pom.xml" package -DskipTests
```

**Verify the JAR was created:**

```bash
ls "$JAVA_DIR/target/kafka-orders-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
```

If compilation fails, check that `java` (17+) and `mvn` are installed.

#### Python (if selected)

Install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r templates/producer_consumer_python/requirements.txt
```

**Verify the install succeeded:**

```bash
python3 -c "import confluent_kafka; print(confluent_kafka.version())"
```

### 3.5 Run the producer (start FIRST)

The producer MUST run **first** to publish messages into Kafka. The consumer reads
them afterwards (the consumer uses `auto.offset.reset=earliest`, so it will pick up
all messages from the beginning of the topic regardless of when it starts).

```bash
bash scripts/run_producer.sh <java|python>
```

Wait for the producer to finish (it will print "Done. Produced 20 messages.").

### 3.6 Run the consumer

After the producer has finished, start the consumer to read and process the messages:

```bash
bash scripts/run_consumer.sh <java|python>
```

The consumer will read all 20 messages (starting from the earliest offset), write
them to `orders_completed.csv`, and then exit (both Java and Python exit
automatically after consuming the expected 20 records).

### 3.7 Verify output

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_output.py
```

This checks that `orders_completed.csv` has 20 rows with correct columns and all
`completed_at` timestamps populated.

**If verification fails**, check:
- The producer finished successfully before the consumer was started
- Environment variables (`KAFKA_HOST`, `KAFKA_PORT`, etc.) are all set
- The `cert/ca.pem` file exists
- For Java: the JAR exists in `templates/producer_consumer_java/target/`
- For Python: `confluent_kafka` is installed

## Step 4: Teardown Information

**DO NOT** run teardown automatically. Instead, inform the user how to clean up when they are ready:

> When you're done with the demo, you can tear down the service by running:
>
> ```bash
> bash scripts/teardown.sh "$KAFKA_SERVICE"
> ```
>
> This will delete the Aiven Kafka service, remove the local `cert/` directory,
> and clean up generated CSV files.

For detailed `avn` CLI command reference and troubleshooting, see [reference.md](reference.md).
