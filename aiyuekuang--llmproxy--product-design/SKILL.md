# 🎯 Feature Prioritization

## RICE Framework

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach:      Users affected per quarter
Impact:     0.25 (minimal) to 3 (massive)
Confidence: 100% (high) to 50% (low)
Effort:     Person-months
```

## MoSCoW Method

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Must Have** | Critical for launch |
| **Should Have** | Important but not critical |
| **Could Have** | Nice to have if time |
| **Won't Have** | Out of scope for now |

## Priority Matrix

```
        High Impact
             │
    Quick    │    Big
    Wins     │    Bets
             │
Low ─────────┼───────── High
Effort       │         Effort
             │
    Fill     │    Money
    Ins      │    Pit
