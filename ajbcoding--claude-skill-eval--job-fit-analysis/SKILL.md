# Job Fit Analysis

## Overview

Analyze fit between job requirements and your background using career lexicons. Identifies strengths, gaps, and develops strategic reframing approaches. Creates detailed cover letter plan grounded in authentic experience.

**Core principle:** Trust the job analysis output - don't re-parse requirements. Focus on gap identification and strategic positioning.

**Announce at start:** "I'm analyzing your fit for this role by comparing the job requirements with your career lexicons to identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities for strategic positioning."

## When to Use

**Standalone:**
- "Analyze my fit for this role"
- "What are my gaps for this position?"
- "Help me plan my cover letter"

**As follow-up to:**
- Job description analysis (need requirements first)
- Resume alignment (understand competitive position)

## Lexicon Integration

**Reads:**
- ✅ `~/career-applications/[job-slug]/01-job-analysis.md` (requirements)
- ✅ `~/lexicons_llm/01_career_philosophy.md` (values)
- ✅ `~/lexicons_llm/02_achievement_library.md` (experience)

**Outputs:**
- Gap analysis with ✅/⚠️/❌ symbols
- Reframing strategies for partial matches
- Cover letter strategic plan
- Evidence trail linking recommendations to lexicons

## Configuration

**Default paths (user can override):**
```python
LEXICONS_DIR = "~/lexicons_llm/"
APPLICATIONS_DIR = "~/career-applications/"
OUTPUT_FILE_PATTERN = "{job-slug}/03-gap-analysis-and-cover-letter-plan.md"
```

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Lexicon Loading

**Required files:**

1. Read: `~/career-applications/[job-slug]/01-job-analysis.md`
   - If missing: "I need a job analysis first. Should I analyze the job description now?"

2. Read: `~/lexicons_llm/01_career_philosophy.md` → store as context
   - If missing: "I need your career lexicons. Run: python run_llm_analysis.py"

3. Read: `~/lexicons_llm/02_achievement_library.md` → store as context

**Important:** Trust the job analysis - don't re-parse the job description. Use the structured analysis directly.

**Verification:** Confirm all files loaded successfully before proceeding

### Phase 1: Load & Review

**Actions:**
- Display job analysis summary (key requirements by priority)
- Review relevant lexicon sections
- Identify potentially matching categories
- Confirm understanding with user

**User Communication:**
```
I've loaded:
- Job analysis for [Job Title] at [Company]
- Your career philosophy ([N] leadership approaches, [N] core values)
- Your achievement library ([N] major categories, [N] key achievements)

Key Job Requirements (from analysis):
1. [Requirement 1] - Priority: HIGH
2. [Requirement 2] - Priority: HIGH
3. [Requirement 3] - Priority: MEDIUM

Relevant sections of your achievement library:
- Section II.A: Capital Projects (3 achievements)
- Section III.A: Revenue Generation (2 achievements)
- Section IV: Academic Leadership (4 achievements)

Ready to analyze your fit and identify opportunities for strategic positioning.
```

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis (Direct Comparison)

**For each requirement category from job analysis:**

Compare job requirements against lexicon achievements using direct matching:

**Output Format:**
```markdown
## Fit Analysis: Section II - Experience & Achievement Requirements

### Capital Projects & Infrastructure
JD Requirement: "$10M+ budget experience, adaptive reuse preferred"
Priority: HIGH (mentioned 7x, specific budget minimums)

Your Achievement Library:
✅ STRONG MATCH: Kirk Douglas Theater
   - $12.1M budget (exceeds requirement)
   - Adaptive reuse project (exact match)
   - 4 variations available for different emphases
   - Source: achievement_library.md:320-430
   - Assessment: COMPETITIVE STRENGTH - exceeds requirement

✅ STRONG MATCH: Outdoor Amphitheater
   - 600-seat venue, ground-up construction

✅ STRONG MATCH: Kirk Douglas Theater
   - Managed 50 full- and part-time staff
   - Cross-functional team complexity
   - Source: achievement_library.md:371
   - Assessment: STRONG - direct evidence with scale

⚠️  PARTIAL MATCH: Academic Advising Crisis
   - Leadership demonstrated, but not direct management
   - Team coordination vs. formal reporting structure
   - Source: achievement_library.md:890-920
   - Assessment: SUPPORTING - shows leadership capability

Overall Assessment: STRONG - direct evidence available

---

### Change Management Certification
JD Requirement: "Certified change management professional preferred"
Priority: MEDIUM (preferred, not required)

Your Achievement Library:
❌ GAP: No certification mentioned

⚠️  REFRAMING OPPORTUNITY:
   - Practical experience: Free-to-Earned Revenue Model transformation
   - Organizational change: 200+ employees affected
   - Evidence: achievement_library.md:520-560
   - Additional: Data Infrastructure Implementation (systems change)
   - Additional: Strategic Planning Leadership (cultural change)

Reframing Strategy Needed: Emphasize practical expertise, frame cert as growth opportunity

Overall Assessment: ADDRESSABLE GAP - strong practical foundation

---

### Values Alignment
JD Requirement: "Commitment to equity, diversity, inclusion, access, and belonging"
Priority: HIGH (mentioned throughout, cultural priority)

Your Career Philosophy:
✅ STRONG MATCH: Core Value - Arts as Social Justice
   - Direct alignment with DEI emphasis
   - Evidence from philosophy lexicon
   - Source: career_philosophy.md:215-240
   - Assessment: AUTHENTIC ALIGNMENT

✅ STRONG MATCH: Leadership Approach - Equity-Centered Practice
   - Structural commitment, not just values statement
   - Source: career_philosophy.md:125-160
   - Assessment: This is a strength to emphasize

Overall Assessment: AUTHENTIC ALIGNMENT - exceptional match
```

**Summary Matrix:**

After completing all categories, present summary:

```markdown
## Overall Fit Summary

**Competitive Position:** STRONG CANDIDATE

### Strengths (✅ Direct Matches)
1. Capital Projects & Infrastructure - EXCEEDS requirement
2. Team Leadership - STRONG with direct evidence
3. Values Alignment - EXCEPTIONAL (authentic overlap)
4. Stakeholder Management - COMPETITIVE STRENGTH
5. [Continue for all strong matches]

Total: 8 of 10 key requirements

### Partial Matches (⚠️ Need Reframing)
1. Change Management - Strong practical experience, no certification
2. [Other partial matches]

Total: 2 requirements

### Gaps (❌ Missing Requirements)
1. [If any critical gaps exist]

Total: 0 critical, 1 preferred (certification)

**Recommended Application Strategy:**
Lead with capital project + stakeholder strength, emphasize values alignment,
address certification gap proactively through reframing
```

### Phase 2.5: Gap Verification with User

**CRITICAL: Before proceeding to reframing or document creation, verify all identified gaps with the user.**

**Why this phase exists:**
- Ensure gaps are genuine (not analysis errors)
- Identify information missing from lexicons
- Catch achievements that exist but weren't surfaced
- Prevent inaccurate competitive positioning

**Process for each identified gap (❌) or partial match (⚠️):**

1. **Present the gap clearly:**
```
I identified a potential gap:

Requirement: [Exact requirement from job]
Priority: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW from job analysis]
Current Assessment: ❌ GAP or ⚠️ PARTIAL MATCH

My analysis: [Brief explanation of why assessed as gap]

Is this truly a gap in your background?
```

2. **Ask yes/no question using AskUserQuestion:**
```
Is "[requirement]" a genuine gap in your experience?
- Yes, I don't have this experience
- No, I do have this experience
```

3. **If user says "No" (gap is incorrect):**
```
You indicated you DO have experience with [requirement].

Help me understand what I missed:

A) This experience exists in different documents not yet in lexicons
   → Which documents should I look for?
   → What role/timeframe had this experience?

B) This experience is in the lexicon but I missed the connection
   → Can you point me to where this appears?
   → What achievement/section should I review?

C) The requirement is being interpreted too narrowly
   → How should I understand this requirement?
   → What experience of yours actually meets it?

D) This is captured under a different category/label
   → Where in your background does this appear?
```

4. **If user says "Yes" (confirmed gap):**
```
Confirmed gap: [requirement]

Follow-up questions:

A) Do you have ANY related experience (even if not exact match)?
   → What's the closest experience you have?
   → This helps us build reframing strategy

B) Is this a learnable skill or fixed requirement?
   → Can you develop this if hired?
   → Should we frame as growth opportunity?

C) How critical is this gap to your competitiveness?
   → Deal-breaker or addressable?
   → Should we apply anyway?
```

**Document all verification outcomes:**

```markdown
## Gap Verification Summary

### Verified Gaps (User Confirmed)
1. **[Requirement]** - Priority: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
   - User confirmation: "Yes, genuine gap"
   - Related experience: [If any]
   - Reframing potential: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
   - User notes: "[Any context provided]"
   - Verified: YYYY-MM-DD

### Corrected Assessments (Analysis Errors)
1. **[Requirement]** - Originally assessed as GAP
   - User correction: "I have this experience"
   - Location in background: [User's explanation]
   - Action needed:
     * ✅ Update lexicons with [specific documents]
     * ✅ Re-analyze Section [X] for this experience
     * ✅ Verify achievement at [lexicon location]
   - Status: REQUIRES LEXICON UPDATE

### Lexicon Gaps Identified
[List of missing information that should be added to lexicons]

### Analysis Improvements Needed
[List of misinterpretations or narrow readings to correct]
```

**Example Verification Conversation:**

```
I identified 3 potential gaps. Let's verify each:

GAP 1 of 3:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Requirement: "5+ years budget management experience with budgets exceeding $1M"
Priority: HIGH (mentioned 4x, critical competency)
My Assessment: ⚠️ PARTIAL MATCH

Why: I found your Shakespeare Center budget ($1.6M) but this was 3 years, not 5.

Is this a genuine gap? (Yes/No)

[User answers: "No"]

You indicated you DO have 5+ years of $1M+ budget experience.

What did I miss?
A) Experience in documents not yet in lexicons
B) Experience is in lexicon but I missed it
C) I'm interpreting the requirement too narrowly
D) This appears under different category/label

[User answers: "B - My current COTA Associate Dean role has $29M budget and I've been in it for 2 years, plus Shakespeare Center was 3 years = 5 years total"]

Thank you! I see the issue. I didn't connect your COTA role budget to this requirement.

Let me update my analysis:
✅ STRONG MATCH - EXCEEDS:
- Current role: $29M budget (2 years and ongoing)
- Previous role: $1.6M budget (3 years)
- Total: 5+ years with budgets exceeding $1M
- Actually EXCEEDS requirement substantially

This changes your competitive position significantly. Continuing verification...
```

**Timing:**
- Complete gap verification BEFORE Phase 3 (Reframing)
- May need to loop back to Phase 2 if major corrections needed
- Document updates required before proceeding to cover letter plan

**Success Criteria:**
✅ Every gap/partial match verified with user
✅ User had opportunity to correct analysis errors
✅ Missing lexicon content identified for future updates
✅ User confirms final gap list before reframing strategies developed
✅ Competitive position assessment is accurate

---

### Phase 3: Reframing Strategy Development

**For each VERIFIED gap or partial match from Phase 2.5:**

Use AskUserQuestion tool to present reframing options:

**Example:**
```markdown
Gap Identified: "Change management certification preferred"

Your Background: Extensive practical change management experience
- Free-to-Earned Revenue Model (organizational transformation)
- Data Infrastructure Implementation (systems change)
- Strategic Planning Leadership (cultural change)

Reframing Options:

A) Emphasize Practical Expertise
"While not formally certified in change management, I have led three major
organizational transformations affecting 200+ employees, applying change
management principles including stakeholder analysis, communication planning,
and resistance mitigation"

Best for: When practical experience is extensive and certification is "preferred" not "required"
Philosophy connection: Evidence-based practice (career_philosophy.md:280)
Achievement sources: achievement_library.md:520, 670, 890

B) Frame as Growth Opportunity
"My practical change management experience positions me to pursue formal
certification, which would formalize the expertise gained through [specific examples]"

Best for: When showing commitment to professional development
Demonstrates: Growth mindset, continuous learning
Complements: Your other certifications/credentials

C) Highlight Transferable Framework
"Applied evidence-based change management frameworks in [specific transformation],
including Kotter's 8-step model for the revenue transition and adaptive leadership
principles for the data infrastructure implementation"

Best for: When you've used recognized frameworks even without formal training
Demonstrates: Theoretical grounding + practical application
Achievement sources: achievement_library.md:520-560

Which approach feels most authentic and strategic?
```

**Process:**
- Present 2-3 reframing options for each gap
- Ground each option in actual lexicon achievements
- User confirms preferred approach
- Document chosen strategy with sources
- Build reframing list for cover letter integration

**Build Reframing Documentation:**
```python
reframing_strategies = {
    "change_management_certification": {
        "gap": "Certification preferred",
        "background": "Extensive practical experience",
        "chosen_approach": "A) Emphasize Practical Expertise",
        "sources": ["achievement_library.md:520", "achievement_library.md:670"],
        "cover_letter_integration": "Paragraph 3: Transformation Experience",
        "user_confirmed": "2025-10-31"
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Cover Letter Plan Development

**Based on gaps + reframing + strengths:**

**Structure:**
```markdown
## Cover Letter Strategic Plan

### Opening Strategy (Values Alignment)
**Recommendation:** Institutional Positioning pattern
**Why:** Job emphasizes [Company]'s unique assets in [sector/context]

**From your narrative patterns:**
- Pattern: "[Institution] is uniquely positioned by..."
- Source: narrative_patterns.md:130-145
- When to use: Academic, mission-driven organizations

**Application to this role:**
"[Company's] [Department] is uniquely positioned by its intersection
of [asset 1], [asset 2], and [asset 3] to [mission]—a vision that aligns
precisely with my [N]-year commitment to [your philosophy value]."

**Example:**
"UCLA's School of the Arts and Architecture is uniquely positioned by its intersection
of artistic excellence, research innovation, and public mission to advance arts as
a tool for social transformation—a vision that aligns precisely with my 15-year
commitment to arts-as-social-justice practice."

**Philosophy connection:**
Links to career_philosophy.md:215 (Arts as Social Justice value)

**Keywords to incorporate:**
- [Keyword 1 from job analysis]
- [Keyword 2 from job analysis]

---

### Middle Development (Achievements + Reframing)

**Paragraph 2: [Primary Strength - Achievement Category]**
**Recommended Achievement:** [Achievement Name]
**Variation:** [Variation type from library]
**Why this achievement:**
- Connects to: Their emphasis on "[requirement]"
- Scale: [Exceeds/Meets/Demonstrates] requirement
- Demonstrates: [Key competency]

**Source:** achievement_library.md:[line numbers]

**Narrative Pattern:** Challenge → Action → Result
**Estimated length:** 120-140 words

**Draft Guidance:**
Context/Challenge: "[Set up the situation]"

**Narrative Pattern:** Context → Insight → Application
**Estimated length:** 120-140 words

**Draft Guidance:**
Context: "[Situational setup that shows understanding]"
Insight: "[Your recognition or learning]"
Application: "[How you applied this, with results]"

[If reframing a gap:]
**Reframe language:** "[Approved reframing approach from Phase 3]"

---

**Paragraph 4: [Values-Driven Leadership or Additional Strength]**
**Recommended Focus:** [Philosophy theme or achievement]
**Connects to:** Their [value/requirement] commitment

**Source:** career_philosophy.md:[line numbers]

**Purpose:** Deepen values alignment, show cultural fit
**Estimated length:** 100-120 words

---

### Closing Strategy
**Recommendation:** Values Reaffirmation + Forward-Looking Invitation
**Pattern:** Synthesize alignment + vision + invitation

**Template:**
"The [Job Title] role offers the opportunity to bring my [strength 1],
[strength 2], and [philosophy value] to an institution uniquely positioned
to [their mission]. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my
experience aligns with [Company]'s vision for [department/initiative]."

**Tone notes:**
- "offers the opportunity" = enthusiastic but not presumptuous
- "uniquely positioned" = callback to opening (structural cohesion)
- "discuss how" = invitation, collaborative tone
- Avoid: "I am the ideal candidate" (presumptuous)

**Estimated length:** 70-80 words

---

### Tone Profile
**Job requirement (from analysis Section III):**
- [Formality level from job analysis]
- [Innovation level from job analysis]
- [Collaboration level from job analysis]

**Your natural voice (from past letters + lexicon):**
- [Your established tone patterns]

- [Your characteristic language]

**Recommended synthesis:**
- Formality level: [Specific recommendation]
- Sentence structure: [Mix description]
- Vocabulary: [Guidance on word choices]
- Emotional register: [Tone description]

**Language guidance:**
- ✅ Use: [Verbs/phrases from your language bank that match their culture]
- ✅ Mirror their verbs: "[verb 1]," "[verb 2]," "[verb 3]"
- ❌ Avoid: [Language not in your lexicon or mismatched to their culture]

---

### Total Estimated Length
- Opening: ~100 words
- Development: ~360 words (3 paragraphs × 120 words)
- Closing: ~75 words
- **Total: 535 words** (appropriate for this role level)

---

### Integration with Resume
**Ensure complementarity, not duplication:**

**Resume emphasizes:** [Achievement aspects highlighted in resume]
**Cover letter emphasizes:** [Different aspects or additional context]

**Example:**
- Resume bullet: "Stewarded $12.1M capital project from conception through delivery"
- Cover letter expansion: Context of partnership complexity, stakeholder navigation, community impact
```

### Phase 5: JSON Export for Wrapper Application

**After completing cover letter plan development, create structured JSON output:**

**Write to:** `~/career-applications/[job-slug]/job-fit-analysis-v1.json`

## Error Handling

### Missing Lexicons

```markdown
**If career_philosophy.md not found:**

"I can't find your career philosophy lexicon at ~/lexicons_llm/01_career_philosophy.md

I need this to analyze values alignment and develop authentic positioning.

To generate your lexicons:
1. cd /path/to/career-lexicon-builder
2. python run_llm_analysis.py

This analyzes your career documents and creates the lexicons I need.

Should I wait while you generate them?"
```

```markdown
**If achievement_library.md not found:**

"I can't find your achievement library at ~/lexicons_llm/02_achievement_library.md

I need this to match your verified achievements to job requirements.

To generate your lexicons:
1. cd /path/to/career-lexicon-builder
2. python run_llm_analysis.py

Should I wait while you generate them?"
```

### Missing Job Analysis

```markdown
**If no job analysis found:**

"I need a job analysis to know what requirements to compare against.

Options:
1. Analyze the job description now (I'll invoke job-description-analysis skill)
2. You already have an analysis - specify the path
3. Cancel and run job analysis separately

Which would you prefer?"

[If user chooses option 1:]
"I'll analyze the job description first, then return to the fit analysis.
Please paste or upload the job posting."
```

### No Matching Achievements

```markdown
**If no lexicon achievements match a HIGH priority requirement:**

"I couldn't find achievements in your library that directly match this HIGH priority requirement:
'[Requirement from job]'

This suggests either:
1. You have this experience but it's not in your lexicons
   → Add documents covering this experience and regenerate lexicons

2. This is a genuine gap (significant competitive concern)
   → We can develop reframing strategy but it may be a stretch

3. The requirement can be demonstrated through different achievements
   → Let's explore transferable experience

What would you like to do:
- Explore transferable achievements in your library
- Add this as a critical gap requiring cover letter attention
- Update lexicons with missing experience first
- Proceed with gaps documented for transparent assessment
```

### User Rejects Reframing Strategy

```markdown
**If user says "None of these reframing approaches feel authentic":**

"I understand these don't resonate. Let's explore this differently.

For the gap: [Requirement]

What is it about these approaches that feels inauthentic?
- The language doesn't sound like you?
- The framing feels like spin?
- The achievement examples don't truly connect?
- Something else?

[Listen to response]

Based on what you've shared, let me try a different approach:

[Generate new reframing options based on user feedback]

Or we can:
- Acknowledge this as a straightforward gap in cover letter
- Focus on compensating strengths instead
- Skip addressing this requirement entirely

What feels most aligned with your values?"
```

### Weak Competitive Position

```markdown
**If overall assessment shows user is under-qualified:**

"Based on this analysis, I need to share a strategic concern:

You match [N] of [N] requirements, but the gaps are in HIGH priority areas:
- [Critical gap 1]
- [Critical gap 2]

This suggests you may be under-qualified for this specific role as posted.

However, consider:

A) Strategic Application Anyway
   - Possible: if you have unique value proposition they haven't considered
   - Risk: Time investment with low conversion probability
   - Approach: Very strong values alignment story + long-term potential framing

B) Wait for Better Fit
   - Look for similar roles with requirements better matched to your background
   - Build missing experience first
   - Apply when competitive position is stronger

C) Networking Approach
   - Connect with hiring manager before formal application
   - Learn if requirements are flexible
   - Understand if they'd consider candidates with different profile

What's your instinct about how to proceed?"
```

## Example Output Excerpt

```markdown
## II. Detailed Gap Analysis

### Capital Projects & Infrastructure
JD Requirement: "Proven experience managing capital projects with budgets exceeding $5M"
Priority: HIGH (mentioned 7x, first requirement in qualifications section)

Your Achievement Library:
✅ STRONG MATCH: Kirk Douglas Theater
   - $12.1M budget (EXCEEDS requirement by 140%)
   - Adaptive reuse project (matches sector context)
   - Multi-stakeholder complexity (public-private partnership)
   - Source: achievement_library.md:320-430
   - Variations available:
     * Variation A: Project Management Focus (lines 338-342)
     * Variation B: Financial Stewardship Focus (lines 348-352)
     * Variation C: Stakeholder Engagement Focus (lines 358-370)

✅ STRONG MATCH: Outdoor Amphitheater
   - 600-seat venue, ground-up construction
   - Demonstrates range: new construction + adaptive reuse
   - Source: achievement_library.md:405-450
   - Purpose: Supporting evidence of consistent capital project success

Assessment: COMPETITIVE STRENGTH
You don't just meet this requirement—you exceed it with verified, large-scale experience.
This should be a PRIMARY emphasis in both resume and cover letter.

Recommendation: Use Kirk Douglas Theater (Variation C: Stakeholder focus) in cover letter
to connect capital project expertise with their collaboration culture emphasis.

→ **Ready for cover letter paragraph 2 (primary achievement story)**
