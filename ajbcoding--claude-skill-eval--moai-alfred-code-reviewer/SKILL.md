## What It Does

Provides systematic guidance for enterprise-grade code review processes applying **TRUST 5 principles**, validating SOLID principles, identifying security issues, ensuring maintainability, and automating quality gates across all programming languages.

---

## The TRUST 5 Review Framework

### T - Test First
**Focus**: Test coverage, quality, comprehensiveness

**Key Questions**:
- Are tests comprehensive? Do they cover happy path + edge cases?
- Test coverage ≥ 85%?
- Tests verify behavior, not just implementation?
- Edge cases handled: null, empty, boundary values?
- Async/concurrent scenarios tested?

**Tools**: pytest coverage, jest --coverage, go test -cover, cargo test

**Examples**:
```python
# ❌ Bad: Tests implementation, not behavior
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 2) == 4

# ✅ Good: Tests behavior with edge cases
def test_add_positive_numbers():
    assert add(2, 2) == 4
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(0, 0) == 0
    
def test_add_boundary():
    assert add(int.max, 1) == overflow_behavior()
```

### R - Readable
**Focus**: Code clarity, self-documentation, maintainability

**Key Questions**:
- Are function/variable names meaningful and clear?
- Can a new team member understand the intent?
- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT (code shows what)?
- Cyclomatic complexity reasonable (<10)?
- Functions single responsibility?
- Magic numbers extracted as constants?

**Tools**: linters, code formatters, readability checkers

**Examples**:
```python
# ❌ Bad: Unclear intent
def calc(x, y, z):
    return x * (1 + y / 100) - z * 0.05

# ✅ Good: Clear intent with constants
DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.05
TAX_RATE = 0.05

def calculate_final_price(base_price: float, tax_percent: float, discount: float) -> float:
    """Calculate final price after tax and discount.
    
    Args:
        base_price: Original product price
        tax_percent: Tax percentage (0-100)
        discount: Discount amount to subtract
    """
    with_tax = base_price * (1 + tax_percent / 100)
    return with_tax - (discount * DISCOUNT_RATE)
```

### U - Unified
**Focus**: Consistency, patterns, architectural cohesion

**Key Questions**:
- Does code follow team patterns and conventions?
- Consistent with codebase style?
- Uses established error handling patterns?
- Logging strategy aligned?
- Database access follows repository pattern?
- API design consistent with existing endpoints?

**Tools**: style guides, architectural patterns, linters

**Examples**:
```python
# ❌ Bad: Inconsistent error handling
def get_user(user_id):
    try:
        return fetch_from_db(user_id)
    except Exception as e:
        return None  # Inconsistent with rest of codebase

# ✅ Good: Consistent error handling
def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    """Get user by ID.
    
    Raises:
        UserNotFoundError: If user doesn't exist
        DatabaseError: If database connection fails
    """
    try:
        return self.user_repository.find_by_id(user_id)
    except DatabaseConnectionError as e:
        logger.error(f"Database error: {e}")
        raise DatabaseError(str(e)) from e
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        raise
```

### S - Secured
**Focus**: Security vulnerabilities, input validation, secret handling

**Key Questions**:
- Are inputs validated before use?
- No hardcoded credentials, API keys, or secrets?
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)?
- XSS prevention (output escaping)?
- CSRF tokens used for state-changing operations?
- Authentication required for sensitive operations?
- Rate limiting on public endpoints?
- Dependency vulnerabilities scanned?

**Tools**: bandit, safety, npm audit, go vet, security scanners

**Examples**:
```python
# ❌ Bad: SQL injection vulnerability
def get_user(user_id):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # Vulnerable!
    return db.execute(query)

# ✅ Good: Parameterized query
def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
    return db.execute(query, [user_id])
```

### T - Trackable

**Key Questions**:
- Changelog entry added?
- Git history clear and atomic?
- Breaking changes documented?
- Migration guides for version updates?


**Examples**:
```python
# ❌ Bad: No traceability
def calculate_discount(price, customer_type):
    if customer_type == "vip":
        return price * 0.8
    return price

# ✅ Good: Full traceability
def calculate_discount(price: float, customer_type: str) -> float:
    """Calculate discount based on customer type.
    
    Implements SPEC-042: VIP customers receive 20% discount
    
    Linked to:
    - SPEC-042: VIP pricing requirements
    - TEST-042-001: VIP discount validation
    - PR #1234: Feature implementation
    """
    VIP_DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.20
    
    if customer_type == "vip":
        return price * (1 - VIP_DISCOUNT_RATE)
    return price
```

## SOLID Principles Checklist

| Principle | Focus | Review Question |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **S**ingle Responsibility | One reason to change | Does this class/function do one thing? |
| **O**pen/Closed | Open for extension, closed for modification | Can behavior be extended without modifying? |
| **L**iskov Substitution | Substitutable subtypes | Can derived classes replace base without breaking? |
| **I**nterface Segregation | Minimal, specific interfaces | Are clients forced to depend on methods they don't use? |
| **D**ependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions, not concretions | Do high-level modules depend on low-level implementations? |

## Best Practices

### DO
- **Automate repetitive checks**: Linting, coverage, formatting
- **Focus human review on high-value areas**: Architecture, security, design
- **Be constructive**: Review code, not people
- **Explain WHY**: Help reviewer understand the reasoning
- **Request specific changes**: Not vague "improve this"
- **Provide examples**: Show the better approach
- **Flag trade-offs**: Explain choices made
- **Document decisions**: Comment on why certain patterns chosen

### DON'T
- **Nitpick style**: Let linters handle formatting
- **Reject without alternatives**: Always suggest improvements
- **Make personal comments**: Focus on code quality
- **Review when tired**: Quality suffers
- **Block on minor issues**: Distinguish critical from nice-to-have
- **Skip security review**: Always check authentication, validation, secrets
- **Ignore test coverage**: Enforce ≥85% requirement
