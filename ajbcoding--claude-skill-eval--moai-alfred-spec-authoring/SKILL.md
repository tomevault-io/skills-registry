# SPEC-001: Add User Authentication with JWT

## Overview
Implement secure JWT-based user authentication with password hashing and token validation.

## Requirements

### REQ-001 (Universal)
SPEC: The authentication service SHALL validate JWT tokens using RS256 algorithm against the public key.

### REQ-002 (Conditional)
SPEC: If a JWT token has expired, then the authentication service SHALL reject the request and return HTTP 401.

### REQ-003 (Unwanted Behavior)
SPEC: The authentication service SHALL NOT accept JWT tokens signed with symmetric algorithms (HS256, HS384, HS512).

### REQ-004 (Stakeholder)
As an API consumer, I want to pass JWT tokens in the Authorization header so that my requests are authenticated.

### REQ-005 (Boundary Condition)
SPEC: The authentication service SHALL return HTTP 429 when a single IP attempts more than 10 failed authentications in 5 minutes.

## Unwanted Behaviors

### Security Constraints
- The system SHALL NOT store JWT secrets in source code
- The system SHALL NOT log JWT tokens or sensitive claims

### Performance Constraints
- The system SHALL NOT block on token validation (async pattern)
- The system SHALL NOT cache tokens indefinitely

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 5 REQ patterns implemented and tested
- [ ] Code coverage ≥85%
- [ ] Security scan passed (OWASP Top 10)
- [ ] Performance: JWT validation p99 latency ≤200ms
```

### EARS Pattern Summary

| Pattern | Syntax | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Universal | `The [System] SHALL [Action]` | Core system behavior |
| Conditional | `If [Condition], then [System] SHALL [Action]` | Conditional logic |
| Unwanted Behavior | `The [System] SHALL NOT [Action]` | Security constraints |
| Stakeholder | `As a [Role], I want [Feature] so that [Benefit]` | User stories |
| Boundary Condition | `[System] SHALL [Action] when [Condition]` | Edge cases |

### EARS Requirement Syntax

#### Pattern 1: Universal (Always True)

**Syntax**:
```
SPEC: The [System] SHALL [Action]
```

**Example**:
```
SPEC-001-REQ-001: The authentication service SHALL validate
all JWT tokens using RS256 algorithm against the public key.

Related TEST:
- test_valid_jwt_with_rs256_signature
- test_invalid_jwt_with_wrong_algorithm
```

#### Pattern 2: Conditional (If-Then)

**Syntax**:
```
SPEC: If [Condition], then the [System] SHALL [Action]
```

**Example**:
```
SPEC-001-REQ-002: If a JWT token has expired,
then the authentication service SHALL reject the request
and return HTTP 401 Unauthorized with error code TOKEN_EXPIRED.

Related TEST:
- test_expired_token_returns_401
- test_expired_token_error_message
```

#### Pattern 3: Unwanted Behavior (Negative Requirement)

**Syntax**:
```
SPEC: The [System] SHALL NOT [Action]
```

**Example**:
```
SPEC-001-REQ-003: The authentication service SHALL NOT
accept JWT tokens signed with symmetric algorithms (HS256, HS384, HS512)
in a production environment.

Related TEST:
- test_reject_hs256_signed_token
- test_reject_hs384_signed_token
- test_reject_hs512_signed_token
```

#### Pattern 4: Stakeholder (User Role-Specific)

**Syntax**:
```
SPEC: As a [User Role], I want [Feature] so that [Benefit]
```

**Example**:
```
SPEC-001-REQ-004: As an API consumer,
I want to pass JWT tokens in the Authorization header
so that my requests are authenticated without exposing tokens.

Related TEST:
- test_jwt_from_authorization_header
- test_jwt_in_query_param_rejected
- test_malformed_authorization_header
```

#### Pattern 5: Boundary Condition (Edge Cases)

**Syntax**:
```
SPEC: [System] SHALL [Action] when [Boundary Condition]
```

**Example**:
```
SPEC-001-REQ-005: The authentication service SHALL return
HTTP 429 Too Many Requests when a single IP address
attempts more than 10 failed authentication attempts within 5 minutes.

Related TEST:
- test_rate_limit_after_10_failures
- test_rate_limit_window_5_minutes
- test_rate_limit_by_ip_address
```

## Level 3: Advanced Features

### Version Lifecycle Management

#### Lifecycle States

```
DRAFT → ACTIVE → DEPRECATED → ARCHIVED
  ↓                  ↓
Under Review    Stable, In Use
  ↓                  ↓
Changes Expected    Changes Require
Feedback Pending    Major Version Bump
```

#### State Transitions

**DRAFT → ACTIVE**:
- All acceptance criteria defined
- At least 2 reviewers approved
- No critical open issues
- `version` bumped to 1.0.0
- Status change commit created

**ACTIVE → DEPRECATED**:
- Marked with deprecation reason
- Migration path documented
- Replacement SPEC linked
- 30-day notice period
- Status change commit created

**DEPRECATED → ARCHIVED**:
- No active code references
- All dependent SPECs archived
- Historical record maintained
- No further changes allowed
- Archive commit created

### Unwanted Behaviors Section

**Critical** security and quality constraints that MUST be tested:

```yaml
unwanted_behaviors:
  security:
    - The system SHALL NOT store JWT secrets in source code
    - The system SHALL NOT log JWT tokens or sensitive claims
    - The system SHALL NOT accept mixed algorithm tokens

  performance:
    - The system SHALL NOT block on token validation (async pattern)
    - The system SHALL NOT cache tokens indefinitely

  reliability:
    - The system SHALL NOT fail authentication if secondary cache is down
    - The system SHALL NOT accept malformed JSON Web Tokens

  data_integrity:
    - The system SHALL NOT modify token claims during validation
    - The system SHALL NOT accept tokens from untrusted issuers
```

**Each Unwanted Behavior** requires:
1. Test case verifying non-occurrence
2. Security scanning (where applicable)
3. Performance profiling (where applicable)

### TAG Integration for Traceability

#### TAG Structure (SPEC→TEST→CODE→DOC)

```
      ↓
      ↓
      ↓
```

#### TAG Placement Rules

**SPEC Document**:
```markdown
---
# SPEC-001: Feature Name
---
```

**Test File**:
```python
def test_requirement_001():
    """Test SPEC-001 REQ-001 universal pattern."""
    pass
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def authenticate_user(token: str) -> bool:
    """Validate JWT token per SPEC-001."""
    pass
```

**Documentation**:
```markdown
## Authentication Flow
Per SPEC-001, the system SHALL validate all JWT tokens...
```
