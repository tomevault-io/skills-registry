class EnterpriseProviderSelector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.context7_client = Context7Client()
        self.cost_calculator = CostCalculator()
    
    async def select_optimal_providers(self, 
                                     requirements: ApplicationRequirements,
                                     constraints: Constraints) -> ProviderRecommendation:
        """Select optimal BaaS providers using AI analysis."""
        
        # Get latest provider documentation via Context7
        providers = ['auth0', 'clerk', 'firebase', 'supabase', 'neon', 'vercel', 'railway']
        
        provider_docs = {}

            )
            provider_docs[provider] = docs
        
        # Analyze requirements compatibility
        compatibility_analysis = self._analyze_compatibility(requirements, provider_docs)
        
        # Calculate total cost of ownership
        cost_analysis = self.cost_calculator.analyze_providers(
            requirements, provider_docs, constraints
        )
        
        return ProviderRecommendation(
            primary_provider=compatibility_analysis.best_match,
            secondary_providers=compatibility_analysis.alternatives,
            cost_projection=cost_analysis.projections,

# Advanced Implementation (Level 3)

## November 2025 Enterprise BaaS Trends

### Emerging Patterns
- **Edge-First Architecture**: Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Supabase Edge Functions
- **PostgreSQL Renaissance**: Supabase, Neon gaining enterprise adoption
- **Real-Time Capabilities**: Firebase Realtime, Supabase subscriptions
- **Vector Databases**: Supabase pgvector, Firebase native vector search
- **Self-Hosted Options**: Convex self-hosted, Supabase open-source deployments

### Cost Optimization Strategies
- Serverless auto-scaling reduces idle costs

- Multi-region disaster recovery

## Implementation Roadmap Template

### Phase 1: Assessment (Week 1-2)
- Analyze current architecture and requirements
- Evaluate provider options against requirements
- Conduct cost analysis and ROI calculation
- Create detailed implementation plan

### Phase 2: Setup (Week 3-4)
- Create provider accounts and projects
- Configure authentication and authorization
- Setup monitoring and alerting
- Document architecture and access procedures

### Phase 3: Development (Week 5-12)
- Implement application with BaaS services
- Build integrations between services
- Test security and compliance requirements
- Establish backup and disaster recovery

### Phase 4: Testing (Week 13-16)
- Conduct security testing and audits
- Perform load testing and benchmarking
- Test disaster recovery procedures
- Train team and document operations

### Phase 5: Deployment (Week 17-20)
- Deploy to staging environment
- Conduct final validation
- Execute gradual production rollout
- Monitor and optimize performance

## Common Pitfalls and Mitigation

| Pitfall | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Single provider dependency | High switching cost | Use multi-cloud strategy |
| No disaster recovery | Data loss risk | Regular backups + failover testing |
| Unoptimized costs | Budget overruns | Monthly cost analysis + optimization |
| Security gaps | Breach risk | Security audits + compliance checks |
| Performance bottlenecks | User experience | Load testing + monitoring |
