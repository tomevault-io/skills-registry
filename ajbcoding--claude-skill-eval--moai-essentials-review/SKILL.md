## What It Does

Automates comprehensive code review process with AI-powered quality checks, TRUST 5 principle validation, security vulnerability detection, performance analysis, test coverage verification, and detailed review feedback generation.

---

## 3-Phase Automated Review

### Phase 1: Automated Checks (5 minutes)

```
Syntax & Linting:
  ✓ Run linters (pylint, eslint, golint, etc.)
  ✓ Check code formatting (black, prettier, gofmt)
  ✓ Type checking (mypy, TypeScript, go vet)

Security Scanning:
  ✓ Dependency vulnerabilities (safety, npm audit, cargo audit)
  ✓ Credential detection (git-secrets, detect-secrets)
  ✓ OWASP Top 10 checks

Test Coverage:
  ✓ Coverage ≥85%
  ✓ Critical paths covered
  ✓ Edge cases tested
```

### Phase 2: AI Quality Analysis (15 minutes)

```
TRUST 5 Validation:
  ✓ T - Tests present and comprehensive
  ✓ R - Code readable and maintainable
  ✓ U - Unified with codebase patterns
  ✓ S - Security best practices

Design Analysis:
  ✓ SOLID principles
  ✓ Design patterns appropriate
  ✓ Scalability concerns
  ✓ Performance implications
```

### Phase 3: Human Review (20 minutes)

```
Architectural Review:
  ✓ Does solution fit architecture?
  ✓ Any alternatives considered?
  ✓ Trade-offs documented?

Business Logic:
  ✓ Does it solve the problem?
  ✓ Any edge cases missed?
  ✓ User experience impact?

Documentation:
  ✓ README updated
  ✓ API docs current
  ✓ Examples provided
```

## AI-Powered Quality Checks

### Code Quality Metrics

```python
class CodeQualityAnalyzer:
    """AI-powered code quality analysis."""
    
    async def analyze(self, code: str) -> QualityReport:
        metrics = {
            "complexity": calculate_cyclomatic(code),      # Should be <10
            "testability": assess_testability(code),        # Should be >0.85
            "maintainability": calculate_maintainability(code),  # Should be >80
            "readability": assess_readability(code),         # Should be clear
            "security_issues": scan_for_vulnerabilities(code),   # Should be 0
            "performance_concerns": detect_patterns(code),   # Should be minimal
        }
        
        return QualityReport(metrics)
```

### TRUST 5 Automated Checks

```
T - Test First:
  ├─ Coverage ≥85%? ✓
  ├─ Happy path covered? ✓
  ├─ Edge cases tested? ✓
  └─ Error scenarios? ✓

R - Readable:
  ├─ Functions <50 lines? ✓
  ├─ Meaningful names? ✓
  ├─ Comments explain WHY? ✓
  └─ Complexity <10? ✓

U - Unified:
  ├─ Follows team patterns? ✓
  ├─ Consistent style? ✓
  ├─ Error handling aligned? ✓
  └─ Logging strategy consistent? ✓

S - Secured:
  ├─ Inputs validated? ✓
  ├─ No hardcoded secrets? ✓
  ├─ SQL injection prevention? ✓
  └─ XSS prevention? ✓

T - Trackable:
  ├─ SPEC referenced? ✓
```

## Security Vulnerability Detection

```
Critical Checks:
  ✓ Hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords)
  ✓ SQL injection vectors
  ✓ XSS vulnerabilities
  ✓ CSRF token absence
  ✓ Unsafe deserialization
  ✓ Privilege escalation paths

High Priority:
  ✓ Missing input validation
  ✓ Weak cryptography
  ✓ Insecure randomness
  ✓ Race conditions
  ✓ Dependency vulnerabilities

Medium Priority:
  ✓ Missing error messages
  ✓ Insufficient logging
  ✓ Memory leaks
  ✓ Resource exhaustion risks
```

---

## Performance Analysis

```
Detection Patterns:
  ✓ O(n²) algorithms in O(n) context
  ✓ Unnecessary file I/O in loops
  ✓ Blocking operations in async code
  ✓ Memory allocations in hot paths
  ✓ Inefficient string concatenation
  ✓ Database queries without indexing

Optimization Suggestions:
  ✓ Use more efficient algorithm
  ✓ Cache results
  ✓ Batch operations
  ✓ Use async/await properly
  ✓ Index database columns
```
