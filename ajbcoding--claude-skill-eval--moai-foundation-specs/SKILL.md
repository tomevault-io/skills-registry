# SPEC Foundation Skill - Expert v4.0

## Skill Overview

**SPEC** (Specification) is the formal requirements document that drives SPEC-first, TDD development. This Skill provides comprehensive guidance on SPEC lifecycle management, version control, approval workflows, traceability, and integration with MoAI-ADK development pipeline.

### Quick Facts
- **4 SPEC Lifecycle States**: Draft, Active, Deprecated, Archived
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- **Approval Workflow**: Author → Review → Approval → Deployment
- **Integration**: Core of `/alfred:1-plan` workflow in MoAI-ADK

### When to Use This Skill
- Creating formal specifications before development
- Managing specification versions and evolution
- Setting up approval workflows for requirements
- Tracing requirements through code and tests
- Organizing multiple specifications in complex projects

---

## Level 1: Foundation - SPEC Lifecycle

### 1. Draft State - Specification Creation

**Purpose**: Initial specification authoring and refinement

**Activities**:
```
1. Specification Author creates SPEC-XXX/spec.md
2. Define requirements using EARS patterns
3. Gather stakeholder input
4. Refine until ready for review
5. Create acceptance criteria
6. Document known risks and constraints
```

**Typical Duration**: 2-5 days (simple features) to 2-4 weeks (complex systems)

**Key Artifacts**:
- `spec.md` - Main specification document
- `acceptance-criteria.md` - Acceptance tests (if separate)
- `technical-notes.md` - Implementation guidance (optional)

**Deliverables for Review**:
- ✅ Clear problem statement
- ✅ EARS-format requirements (functional & non-functional)
- ✅ Acceptance criteria for all requirements
- ✅ Architecture/design notes
- ✅ Risk assessment
- ✅ Dependencies identified

**Example Draft Structure**:
```markdown
# SPEC-045: User Authentication System

## Problem Statement
Current system lacks multi-factor authentication. Need MFA for security compliance.

## Requirements
REQ-001 (Event-Driven): When login_attempted the system eventually satisfies 
        mfa_challenge_presented
REQ-002 (Ubiquitous): The system shall always satisfy mfa_enabled_for_admin = true
REQ-003 (Optional): When mfa_timeout_exceeded the system immediately satisfies 
        session_terminated

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MFA works with authenticator apps (Google, Microsoft)
- [ ] Fallback SMS when app unavailable
- [ ] Session timeout after 10 minutes inactivity
- [ ] Audit log all MFA events

## Technical Notes
- Use TOTP (RFC 6238) for time-based codes
- Backup codes for emergency access
- Consider integration with existing identity system

## Risks
- User adoption of MFA might be low
- SMS delivery reliability (use backup)
```

**Draft Anti-Patterns - Avoid**:
- ❌ Vague requirements ("system shall be secure")
- ❌ Mixing implementation details with requirements
- ❌ Incomplete acceptance criteria
- ❌ No identified risks or constraints
- ❌ Unsourceable or unmeasurable requirements

---

### 2. Review State - Formal Evaluation

**Purpose**: Peer review and stakeholder feedback

**Review Participants**:
- **Author**: Specification creator
- **Technical Lead**: Architecture and feasibility review
- **QA Lead**: Test coverage and acceptance criteria review
- **Product Owner**: Business requirement alignment
- **Domain Experts**: Subject matter expert review (if applicable)

**Review Checklist**:
```
[ ] Requirements are clear and unambiguous
[ ] All requirements are EARS-format
[ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable
[ ] No conflicting requirements
[ ] Architecture feasible
[ ] Risk assessment complete
[ ] Traceability clear
[ ] No external dependencies missing
[ ] Timeline realistic
[ ] Budget/resources adequate
```

**Review Process**:
1. **Initial Submission**: Author marks SPEC ready for review
2. **Reviewer Comments**: Team adds comments/questions
3. **Author Responses**: Author clarifies or updates spec
4. **Revisions**: 2-3 rounds typical for complex specs
5. **Consensus**: Team agrees specification is complete
6. **Approval Gate**: Technical lead + Product owner sign-off

**Review Duration**: 3-7 business days (parallel review)

**Version Bumping Rules**:
- Each revision during review: increment patch (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
- Major revisions (scope change): increment minor (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)

---

### 3. Active State - Implementation Period

**Purpose**: Specification is approved and development proceeds

**Activation Steps**:
1. Technical lead approves and signs SPEC
2. Create feature branch: `feature/SPEC-XXX`
3. Implement per SPEC requirements
4. Tests validate against acceptance criteria

**During Active Phase**:
- ✅ Spec is reference for development
- ✅ Any change discussion references spec
- ✅ Code reviews verify against spec
- ✅ Tests trace to spec requirements
- ✅ Track deviations and change requests

**Change Management**:
```
If requirement change needed during development:
1. Assess impact on timeline/scope
2. Document change request
3. Get approval from technical lead + product owner
4. Update SPEC with new version
5. Notify implementation team
6. Update code and tests accordingly
```

**Typical Duration**: Development time + testing (1-8 weeks)

**Version Bumping**:
- Minor feature additions: increment minor (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- Bug fixes to spec: increment patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
- Scope changes: increment major (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ All requirements implemented
- ✅ All acceptance criteria passed
- ✅ Code review approved
- ✅ Tests passing (≥85% coverage)
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Ready for deployment

---

### 4. Deprecated State - Phase-Out Period

**Purpose**: Feature is being replaced or removed

**Triggering Events**:
- New feature replaces old functionality
- System architecture change
- Technology upgrade required
- Business decision to sunset feature

**Deprecation Process**:
1. Mark SPEC as DEPRECATED in metadata
2. Create successor SPEC (if applicable)
3. Document migration path for users
4. Set end-of-life date (typically 6-12 months)
5. Notify stakeholders of timeline

**During Deprecation**:
- ✅ Maintain feature (bug fixes)
- ✅ No new feature development
- ✅ Gradual user migration
- ✅ Support successor feature
- ✅ Plan removal

**Deprecation Notice Format**:
```markdown
# SPEC-042: Old Authentication (DEPRECATED)

**Status**: DEPRECATED
**Successor**: SPEC-045 (New MFA Authentication)
**Migration Guide**: See migration-guide.md
**EOL Date**: 2025-12-31 (6 months from deprecation)

## Migration Timeline
- 2025-07: New system available, parallel operation
- 2025-09: Default switch to new system
- 2025-12: Old system shutdown

## Support
- Questions: Ask in #migration channel
- Migration assistance: migration-team@example.com
```

**Version Marking**:
- Mark SPEC with version tag: `v1.5.0 (DEPRECATED)`
- Update status in all references
- Create deprecation notice in documentation

---

### 5. Archived State - Historical Reference

**Purpose**: SPEC is no longer active, kept for historical record

**Archival Process**:
1. Feature removed from production
2. Mark SPEC as ARCHIVED
3. Move to archive directory: `.moai/specs/archived/`
4. Maintain for audit/compliance purposes
5. Tag with final version and EOL date

**Archive Retention**:
- Keep indefinitely for compliance requirements
- Compress old versions
- Index for historical search

**Archive Access**:
- Readable by all (reference)
- No modifications allowed
- Available for audit trails

---

## Level 2: Advanced - Version Management

### Semantic Versioning Strategy

**Format**: `major.minor.patch`

**Versioning Rules**:

```
Starting with: 1.0.0

PATCH (1.0.X):
  - Bug fixes to requirements
  - Minor clarifications
  - No scope change
  Example: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1

MINOR (1.X.0):

  Example: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0

Pre-release versions:
  - 1.0.0-rc1 (release candidate)
  - 1.0.0-beta (beta testing)
  - 0.1.0 (draft versions before 1.0.0)
```
