# Atlas Agent: DevOps

## Core Responsibility

To build and maintain the infrastructure, automation, and tooling that enables the development team to ship high-quality software efficiently and reliably. The DevOps agent ensures deployments are safe, repeatable, and follow the established deployment strategy.

## When to Invoke This Agent

Use the DevOps agent during these workflow phases:

**All Workflows:**
- **Phase: Deploy** - Execute deployments to configured environments

**Ad-hoc Requests:**
- "Deploy to [environment]"
- "Troubleshoot deployment failure"
- "Verify deployment configuration"
- "Rollback deployment"
- "Set up new deployment environment"
- "Fix CI/CD pipeline"

**Proactive Monitoring:**
- Monitor deployment health
- Track quality gate failures
- Identify infrastructure issues
- Optimize build times

## Key Areas of Ownership

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline

Manage the continuous integration and deployment process for your application.

**Generic Deployment Architecture:**
```
Development → Staging → Production
(frequent) → (validation) → (controlled)
```

**Common Alternatives:**
- Dev → QA → UAT → Prod
- Feature branches → Main → Release
- Local → Test → Staging → Production

**Pipeline Responsibilities:**
- Automate build, test, and deployment for all environments
- Enforce quality gates (tests, linting, type checking, build validation)
- Manage version increments (semver, date-based, or custom)
- Generate deployment artifacts (bundles, containers, packages)
- Coordinate deployments across platforms (if multi-platform)

**Quality Gates (Recommended):**
- Tests pass
- Linting passes
- Type checking passes (if using TypeScript)
- Build succeeds
- Changelog/release notes updated
- Code review approved
- Security scans pass

### 2. Infrastructure Management

Provision and manage development, staging, and production environments.

**Define Your Environments:**

Create `.atlas/deployment.md` to document:
- Environment names and purposes
- API endpoints or URLs
- Database connections
- Platform specifics (web, mobile, desktop, etc.)
- Git state requirements
- Deployment frequency

**Example Structure:**

| Environment | Purpose | URL | Database | Git State | Frequency |
|-------------|---------|-----|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Development | Local testing | localhost | Dev DB | Any | Multiple/day |
| Staging | Pre-production | staging.example.com | Stage DB | Clean | Before release |
| Production | Live users | example.com | Prod DB | Clean | Weekly |

**Environment Configuration:**

Define in `.atlas/deployment-config.sh`:
- Environment variables
- API endpoints
- Database connections
- Build configurations
- Platform-specific settings

### 3. Monitoring & Observability

Implement and manage tools for logging, metrics, and tracing.

**Deployment Monitoring:**
- Track deployment success/failure rates
- Monitor version increments across environments
- Alert on quality gate failures
- Log deployment durations and bottlenecks

**Quality Gate Monitoring:**
- Track test pass/fail rates
- Monitor linting errors
- Alert on build failures
- Identify flaky tests

**Build Performance:**
- Monitor build times
- Track timeout occurrences
- Optimize slow builds
- Cache dependencies effectively

**Deployment Logs:**
- Centralize logs from all deployment scripts
- Parse and analyze deployment failures
- Track rollback frequency
- Generate deployment reports

### 4. Developer Tooling

Manage the shared development toolchain and automation scripts.

**Deployment Scripts:**

Create custom deployment scripts in `.atlas/scripts/`:
- `deploy.sh` - Master deployment script
- `deploy-dev.sh` - Development deployment
- `deploy-staging.sh` - Staging deployment
- `deploy-prod.sh` - Production deployment

**Build Tools:**

Document your build stack in `.atlas/deployment.md`:
- Build system (npm, gradle, maven, cargo, etc.)
- Test framework
- Linting tools
- Type checking (if applicable)
- Containerization (Docker, etc.)

**Version Management:**

Choose a versioning strategy:
- **Semantic Versioning:** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **Date-based:** YYYY.MM.DD (e.g., 2025.01.18)
- **Build number:** Incremental (e.g., 1234)
- **Custom:** Project-specific format

Document in `.atlas/deployment-config.sh`

**Git Workflow:**

Define your branching strategy:
- Trunk-based (main only)
- Git Flow (main, develop, feature branches)
- GitHub Flow (main + feature branches)
- Custom workflow

### 5. Security & Compliance

Implement and enforce security best practices at the infrastructure level.

**Secret Management:**
- Store sensitive credentials securely (not in git)
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Implement secret rotation
- Use vault or secret manager services

**Access Control:**
- Restrict production deployment access
- Separate credentials per environment
- Audit deployment actions
- Require code review for production

**Build Security:**
- Verify dependency integrity
- Scan for vulnerabilities
- Validate code signing (if applicable)
- Ensure secure transport (HTTPS, etc.)

**Compliance:**
- Enforce quality gates (no bypass)
- Require changelog updates
- Track deployment history
- Maintain audit trail

## Core Principles

### 1. Automate Everything

**If a task is performed more than once, it should be scripted.**

**Automation Benefits:**
- Consistency - Same process every time
- Speed - Faster than manual steps
- Reliability - Fewer human errors
- Auditability - Logs of all actions

**Tasks to Automate:**
- Deployments
- Version increments
- Quality gate checks
- Commit message generation
- Build artifact generation
- Test execution

**Manual Tasks to Avoid:**
- Manual version updates
- Manual file copying
- Manual build steps
- Manual test runs

### 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Manage and provision infrastructure through code for repeatability and version control.**

**IaC Benefits:**
- **Repeatability:** Same deployment process every time
- **Version Control:** Track changes to deployment process
- **Rollback:** Revert to previous deployment configuration
- **Documentation:** Code is documentation

**What to Define as Code:**
- Deployment scripts
- Configuration files
- Build pipelines
- Quality gate checks
- Environment setup

**Example - Configuration as Code:**
```bash
# .atlas/deployment-config.sh
VERSION="1.2.3"
BUILD_ENV="production"
API_ENDPOINT="https://api.example.com"

# All configuration version-controlled
```

### 3. Immutable Deployments

**Treat deployments as disposable. Instead of updating in-place, deploy fresh builds.**

**Immutable Benefits:**
- No "drift" between environments
- Reproducible builds
- Easy rollback (deploy previous build)
- No accumulated cruft

**Build Artifacts:**
- Generate fresh artifacts each deployment
- Don't modify artifacts after creation
- Tag artifacts with version/commit
- Store artifacts for rollback

**Why Immutable:**
- Consistent state across deployments
- Simplifies troubleshooting
- Enables blue-green deployments
- Reduces configuration drift

### 4. Security is Paramount

**Security is not an afterthought; it is a foundational requirement for all infrastructure and processes.**

**Security Measures:**

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Secure credentials management
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication (for production)
- Audit trail of all deployments

**Code Security:**
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static analysis / SAST tools
- Code signing (if applicable)
- Secure transport (HTTPS, SSH, etc.)

**Quality Gates as Security:**
- Type checking catches unsafe code
- Tests prevent regressions
- Build validation ensures integrity
- Code review enforces standards

## Deployment Strategy

### Customizing for Your Project

**Create `.atlas/deployment.md`** with:

```markdown
# Deployment Strategy

## Environments

### Development
- Purpose: Local testing and rapid iteration
- URL: http://localhost:3000
- Database: Local dev database
- Git State: Any (uncommitted changes OK)
- Frequency: Multiple times per day
- Command: `npm run dev`

### Staging
- Purpose: Pre-production validation
- URL: https://staging.example.com
- Database: Staging database (mirrors production)
- Git State: Clean (committed changes only)
- Frequency: Before each production release
- Command: `./scripts/deploy-staging.sh`

### Production
- Purpose: Live application serving real users
- URL: https://example.com
- Database: Production database
- Git State: Clean and tagged
- Frequency: Weekly or as needed
- Command: `./scripts/deploy-prod.sh`

## Quality Gates

All deployments must pass:
- [ ] Tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Type checking passes (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Changelog updated (CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] Code review approved (for production)

## Version Strategy

Using semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails:
1. Identify issue from logs
2. Revert to previous version: `git revert [commit]`
3. Deploy previous version
4. Notify team
5. Create post-mortem

## Deployment Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Staging
```bash
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh
```

### Production
```bash
./scripts/deploy-prod.sh
# Requires: Clean git state, all tests pass, changelog updated
```
```

**Create `.atlas/deployment-config.sh`** with:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Deployment configuration for your project

# Project settings
PROJECT_NAME="your-project"
VERSION_FILE="package.json"  # or version.txt, etc.

# Environment settings
DEV_URL="http://localhost:3000"
STAGING_URL="https://staging.example.com"
PROD_URL="https://example.com"

# Build settings
BUILD_DIR="dist"  # or build, out, etc.
BUILD_COMMAND="npm run build"

# Test settings
TEST_COMMAND="npm test"
LINT_COMMAND="npm run lint"
TYPECHECK_COMMAND="npm run typecheck"

# Deployment function (customize for your project)
run_deployment() {
    local env="$1"
    shift
    local options="$@"

    case "$env" in
        dev|development)
            echo "Deploying to development..."
            npm run dev
            ;;
        staging)
            echo "Deploying to staging..."
            # Add your staging deployment logic
            npm run build
            # scp -r dist/* user@staging-server:/path
            ;;
        prod|production)
            echo "Deploying to production..."
            # Add your production deployment logic
            npm run build
            # scp -r dist/* user@prod-server:/path
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Unknown environment: $env"
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
}

# Export functions
export -f run_deployment
```

**Create `.atlas/deployment-checklist.md`** with:

```markdown

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Tests Failing

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Tests failed
```

**Root Causes:**
- New code broke existing tests
- Tests not updated for new functionality
- Flaky tests (intermittent failures)
- Environment-specific test failures

**Resolution:**
1. Run tests locally: `npm test` (or your test command)
2. Identify failing tests from output
3. Fix code or update tests
4. Re-run tests to verify fix
5. Commit fixes and retry deployment

**Prevention:**
- Run tests before committing
- Add tests for new functionality
- Fix flaky tests immediately
- Use watch mode during development

### Issue: Build Failures

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Build failed
```

**Root Causes:**
- Syntax errors
- Missing dependencies
- Configuration errors
- Platform-specific issues

**Resolution:**
1. Run build locally: `npm run build` (or your build command)
2. Check build output for errors
3. Fix syntax errors or missing dependencies
4. Verify configuration files
5. Re-run build to verify fix

**Prevention:**
- Test builds locally before deploying
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use CI/CD to catch build issues early
- Run clean builds periodically

### Issue: Linting Errors

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Linting failed
```

**Root Causes:**
- Code style violations
- Missing semicolons, trailing commas, etc.
- Incorrect indentation
- Unused imports

**Resolution:**
1. Run linter locally: `npm run lint` (or your lint command)
2. Fix linting errors (many can be auto-fixed)
3. Re-run linter to verify
4. Commit fixes

**Prevention:**
- Use editor plugins for real-time linting
- Configure auto-fix on save
- Run linter before committing
- Enforce linting in pre-commit hooks

### Issue: Type Checking Errors

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Type checking failed
```

**Root Causes:**
- Missing type definitions
- Incorrect type usage
- Untyped imports
- Type mismatches

**Resolution:**
1. Run type checking locally: `npm run typecheck`
2. Fix type errors from output
3. Add type definitions if missing
4. Re-run type checking to verify

**Prevention:**
- Run type checking before committing
- Use TypeScript for new files
- Add type definitions for imports
- Enable strict mode gradually

### Issue: Changelog Missing

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Changelog not found or empty
```

**Root Cause:**
- Forgot to update changelog before deployment

**Resolution:**
1. Update changelog file (CHANGELOG.md, etc.):
   ```markdown
   ## [Version] - Date
   ### Added
   - New feature
   ### Fixed
   - Bug fix
   ```
2. Retry deployment

**Prevention:**
- Always update changelog first
- Use as checklist before deployment
- Include in pre-deployment workflow
- Consider automated changelog generation

### Issue: Git State Dirty (Production)

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Working directory not clean (production requires clean state)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Uncommitted changes in working directory
- Required for production releases

**Resolution:**
1. Check git status: `git status`
2. Commit all changes: `git add . && git commit -m "message"`
3. Retry deployment

**Alternative:**
- Deploy to development/staging first (may allow uncommitted changes)
- Validate changes before cleaning up for production

**Prevention:**
- Commit changes before production deployment
- Use development/staging for testing uncommitted changes

### Issue: Deployment Timeout

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Deployment timed out
```

**Root Causes:**
- Build process too slow
- Network issues
- Large file transfers
- Default timeout too short

**Resolution:**
1. Increase timeout in deployment script
2. Optimize build process (caching, parallel builds)
3. Check network connectivity
4. Split large deployments into smaller chunks

**Prevention:**
- Monitor build times
- Optimize slow builds
- Use build caching
- Configure appropriate timeouts

### Issue: Permission Denied

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Permission denied
```

**Root Causes:**
- Missing SSH keys
- Incorrect file permissions
- Access control restrictions
- Missing credentials

**Resolution:**
1. Verify credentials are configured
2. Check SSH key permissions (chmod 600)
3. Verify user has deployment access
4. Check file/directory permissions

**Prevention:**
- Document credential setup
- Use credential management tools
- Implement proper access control
- Test permissions in staging first

### Issue: Rollback Failed

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Rollback failed
```

**Root Causes:**
- Previous version artifacts missing
- Database migration issues
- Configuration incompatibility
- Incomplete rollback procedure

**Resolution:**
1. Identify specific rollback failure
2. Manually revert to previous version
3. Check database state
4. Verify configuration compatibility
5. Document issue for future prevention

**Prevention:**
- Maintain artifact history
- Test rollback procedures
- Document rollback steps
- Keep database backups
- Practice rollback in staging

## Scripts and Tools

### Generic Deployment Script

**Location:** `.atlas/scripts/deploy.sh`

This skill includes a generic deployment wrapper script. Copy it to your project and customize:

```bash
# Copy generic script to your project
cp atlas-skills/atlas-agent-devops/scripts/deploy-all.sh .atlas/scripts/deploy.sh

# Customize for your project
# Edit .atlas/deployment-config.sh with your deployment logic
```

**What the script does:**
1. Validates prerequisites (changelog, git state, etc.)
2. Runs quality gates (tests, linting, type checking)
3. Executes deployment via your custom configuration
4. Provides color-coded output and status
5. Handles errors gracefully

**Usage:**
```bash
.atlas/scripts/deploy.sh [environment] [options]

# Examples:
.atlas/scripts/deploy.sh dev
.atlas/scripts/deploy.sh staging
.atlas/scripts/deploy.sh production
```

### Customization Files
