# Email Mailbox Analyzer

This skill provides a tool for analyzing email mailbox usage and generating detailed reports.

## Tool

### email-mailbox-analyzer

Analyzes email mailbox usage by extracting IMAP server configurations from Thunderbird and running the `imapdu` tool to generate detailed usage reports.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Analyze email storage usage across multiple accounts
- Identify large mailboxes that consume significant storage
- Generate CSV reports with mailbox statistics

## Features

- Automatically extracts IMAP server settings from Thunderbird's `prefs.js`
- Runs `imapdu` analysis for each configured email account
- Generates CSV reports with mailbox statistics
- Sorts results by mailbox size for easy identification
- Creates timestamped output directories for organized results

## Requirements

- `uvx` (for running imapdu)
- Thunderbird with IMAP accounts configured
- Bash shell

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To analyze all configured IMAP accounts:

```bash
./scripts/email-mailbox-analyzer.sh
```

### Manual Usage

To run a specific analysis command:

```bash
uvx git+https://github.com/cpackham/imapdu --user sender@example.com --csv --no-human-readable mail.example.com | sort -t, -k3 -n
```

## Output Format

The tool generates CSV files with the following columns:

- `count`: Number of messages in the folder
- `path/to/folder`: Folder path
- `total-bytes`: Total size of all messages in bytes
- `largest-message-bytes`: Size of the largest message in bytes

## Example Output

```
count,path/to/folder,total-bytes,largest-message-bytes
123,INBOX,4567890,123456
45,Sent,2345678,98765
```

## Implementation Details

### Scripts

The skill includes a main script that:

1. Extracts IMAP server configurations from Thunderbird's `prefs.js`
2. Identifies all IMAP accounts (skipping local folders and smart mailboxes)
3. Runs `imapdu` analysis for each account
4. Processes and sorts CSV output by mailbox size
5. Creates timestamped output directories for results

### Configuration

The script automatically detects Thunderbird's configuration by finding the
first `*.default-release` profile directory under `~/.thunderbird/`. If
Thunderbird is installed in a non-standard location, pass the path explicitly
to the script.

### Error Handling

The script includes error handling for:

- Missing Thunderbird configuration files
- Failed IMAP connections
- Authentication issues
- Missing dependencies

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission errors**: Ensure read access to your Thunderbird profile's `prefs.js`
  (find it with `ls ~/.thunderbird/*.default-release/prefs.js`)
- **Connection issues**: Check internet connection and IMAP server availability
- **Authentication problems**: Ensure Thunderbird passwords are up to date
- **Missing dependencies**: Install `uvx` before running the script

## Notes

- Results are sorted by total bytes (column 3) in ascending order
- Each run creates a new timestamped directory in the home folder
- The script automatically skips non-IMAP servers like "Local Folders" and "smart mailboxes"
