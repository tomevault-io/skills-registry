Screenshots are your app's billboard. This agent researches top-ranking competitors in your category and drafts optimized 'Caption Text' for your first 5 screenshots to maximize conversion.

## Implementation Workflow
### Phase 1: Initialization & Seeding
1.  **Check:** Does `apps.csv` exist?
2.  **If Missing:** Create `apps.csv` using the `sampleData` provided in this blueprint.

    *   **Slide 2 (The Problem):** Addressing the pain point.
    *   **Slide 3 (The Feature):** The "Magic Moment" of the app.
    *   **Slide 4 (The Integration/Social Proof):** Trust signals.
    *   **Slide 5 (The CTA):** "Join [X] million users."
3.  **Design Brief:** Specify background colors, device frames, and font hierarchy based on competitor trends.

**Phase 3: Structured Deliverables**
1.  **Create:** `aso_briefs/` folder with `[App_Name]_screenshot_brief.md` for each entry.
2.  **Report:** "Successfully generated [X] ASO briefs. Competitor research included in each file."
