# PR Comment Resolver

Fetch, analyze, and resolve GitHub PR review comments. Present proposed fixes for user approval before applying changes.

**Prerequisite**: `gh` CLI must be authenticated (`gh auth status`).

## Workflow

### 1. Identify the PR

Determine the target PR:
- If user provides a PR number or URL: use it directly
- Otherwise: auto-detect from current branch via `gh pr view --json number -q '.number'`
- If auto-detection fails: ask user to specify

### 2. Fetch Comments

Run the bundled script to collect all comments:

```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/fetch_pr_comments.sh [PR_NUMBER]
```

This returns JSON with `review_comments` (inline), `issue_comments` (general), and `reviews` (summaries).

### 3. Filter Actionable Comments

From the fetched data, identify comments that require action:

- **Skip**: Comments that are resolved, outdated, or purely conversational (e.g., "LGTM", "Thanks!")
- **Prioritize**: Comments with `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review state
- **Group**: Thread replies together using `in_reply_to_id`
- **Categorize** each actionable comment:
  - **Code fix**: Bug, logic error, typo, or style issue pointing to specific code
  - **Refactor**: Structural improvement suggestion
  - **Question**: Reviewer asking for clarification (may not need code change)
  - **Suggestion**: Optional improvement or alternative approach

### 4. Present Analysis

For each actionable comment, present to user:

```
## Comment by @{user} on {path}:{line}
> {comment body}

**Category**: {category}
**Proposed action**: {description of what to change}
**Diff preview**:
  - {old code}
  + {new code}
```

Group related comments together. Present questions separately as they may only need a reply.

### 5. Apply Changes (after user approval)

Only after user confirms:
1. Apply code changes using Edit tool
2. For questions: draft reply text and confirm with user before posting
3. Optionally reply to resolved comments via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{id}/replies -f body="..."`

### 6. Summary

After applying changes, provide a summary:
- Number of comments addressed
- Files modified
- Any comments intentionally skipped with reason
- Suggest committing changes if any code was modified

## Comment Reply Guidelines

When replying to PR comments:
- Be concise and professional
- Reference the specific change made (e.g., "Fixed — changed X to Y as suggested")
- For questions: provide clear, direct answers
- Do not auto-reply without user approval

## References

- For `gh` CLI command details: see [references/gh-commands.md](references/gh-commands.md)
