# Chemometrics Model Validation

## Overview

Proper validation is crucial in chemometrics because models operate in regulated environments with small, high-dimensional datasets where overfitting is a constant risk. Wrong predictions can affect product quality and safety, so rigorous validation underpins every credible calibration.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when designing validation strategies, choosing cross-validation schemes, selecting performance metrics, dealing with small datasets (n < 100), preparing models for regulatory submission, or writing methods sections for publications.

## Quick Reference

### Cross-Validation Decision Tree

```
What is your sample size?

├─ n < 20: Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)
│          • Use with caution (high variance)
│          • Consider repeated random splits instead
│
├─ 20 ≤ n < 50: Leave-One-Out or 5-Fold CV
│               • LOOCV for very small data
│               • 5-Fold with multiple repetitions
│
├─ 50 ≤ n < 200: 5-Fold or 10-Fold CV
│                • 10-Fold is standard
│                • Repeat 3-10 times for stability
│
└─ n ≥ 200: 10-Fold CV or Hold-Out Test Set
            • Can afford 70/30 or 80/20 train/test split
            • Use 10-Fold CV for model selection
            • Report performance on held-out test set

Special considerations:

• Time series data? → Use TimeSeriesSplit (no future leakage)
• Batches/groups? → Use GroupKFold (keep groups together)
• Imbalanced classes? → Use StratifiedKFold (preserve class ratios)
• Spatial data? → Use spatial cross-validation (geographic splits)
```

### Performance Metrics Quick Guide

**Regression:**
- Primary: RMSEP (Root Mean Square Error of Prediction)
- Supporting: R², RPD, Bias, SEP

**Classification:**
- Primary: Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-score
- Supporting: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC AUC
