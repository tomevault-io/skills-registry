# Validate and Fix

## Workflow

1. **Run tests**: `uv run pytest -m "not slow"`
2. **Run pre-commit**: `pre-commit run --all-files`
3. **If either fails**: Fix the issues, then repeat from step 1. Do not stop until both pass.

## Rules

- Iterate until clean. Do not report errors and stop—fix them.
- Exclude slow tests during iteration; run full suite once at the end if desired: `uv run pytest`

## Common Pre-commit Fixes

### E501 Line too long
- **Never** suppress with `# noqa: E501` or add `E501` to `pyproject.toml` ignore list.
- **Fix**: Split the line at a word or operator boundary. For docstrings, wrap to the next line — the
  Google format allows multi-line short descriptions. For code, break at `(`, `,`, or `+`.
