# Second Opinion

Query external agents, get answer, act on it.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/second-opinion` | Get a second opinion on current context |
| `/second-opinion setup` | Configure which agents to enable |
| `/second-opinion status` | Show current configuration |

## Behavior

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Consensus | Proceed silently |
| No consensus, decidable | Decide best option, proceed |
| No consensus, critical | Ask user (rare) |

**Do NOT:**
- Attribute opinions to specific agents
- Show verbose breakdowns
- Summarize what each agent said

**DO:**
- Return actionable next step
- Keep it brief
- Only ask user when truly stuck

## Usage

```json
{
  "query": "Is this the right approach for handling auth?",
  "context": "<code or description>"
}
```

## Output Examples

**Consensus:**
```
Use dependency injection. Add the service as a constructor param.
```

**Decided:**
```
Going with extracted module approach.

_Cleaner separation, easier to test._
```

**Needs input (rare):**
```
Need your input on this one:

- **Sync**: Simpler but blocks UI
- **Async**: More complex but responsive
```

## First-Time Setup

If no agents are configured, run `/second-opinion setup` to:
1. Select which AI agents to enable (interactive)
2. Paste API keys when prompted (stored automatically)
3. GitHub token auto-detected from `gh auth token` if installed

**No file editing required** - everything is configured interactively.
