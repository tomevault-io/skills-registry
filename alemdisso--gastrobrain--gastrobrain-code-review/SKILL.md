# Gastrobrain Code Review Agent

## Purpose

Performs comprehensive code review before merging feature branches to develop, using a **checkpoint-based verification system** that systematically validates quality, completeness, and adherence to project standards.

**Core Philosophy**: Systematic Quality → Checkpoint Verification → Merge Confidence

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Ready to merge feature branch to develop
- Want pre-merge quality verification
- Need systematic review checklist
- Want to verify all acceptance criteria met
- Need confirmation all tests and standards pass
- Want merge readiness assessment

**Triggers**:
- "Review code for #XXX"
- "Ready to merge #XXX"
- "Pre-merge check for #XXX"
- "Code review before merging"
- "/gastrobrain-code-review"

**DO NOT use this skill for:**
- During active development (mid-feature)
- For reviewing individual commits
- For architectural planning (use planning skill)
- For implementing code (use implementation skill)

## Checkpoint-Based Review System

### Why Systematic Checkpoints?

**The Problem with Ad-Hoc Reviews:**
```
❌ BAD: Quick scan → "Looks good" → Merge → Issues discovered in develop
Risk: High (quality issues reach main branch)
Confidence: Low (unsure what was checked)
Consistency: Low (different things checked each time)
```

**The Checkpoint Advantage:**
```
✅ GOOD: CP1 (git) → CP2 (roadmap) → CP3 (criteria) → ... → Merge with confidence
Risk: Low (systematic verification)
Confidence: High (everything checked)
Consistency: High (same checks every time)
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Completeness**: Nothing overlooked (systematic checklist)
2. **Quality Assurance**: Technical standards verified
3. **Acceptance Validation**: All criteria explicitly checked
4. **Issue Prevention**: Problems caught before merge
5. **Merge Confidence**: Clear approval based on evidence
6. **Audit Trail**: Record of what was verified

## Seven Standard Checkpoints

### Overview

Every code review follows this structure:

1. **Git Status & Branch Verification** - Clean working state
2. **Roadmap Completion** - All phases complete
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - All requirements met
4. **Technical Standards** - Tests, analyze, coverage
5. **Code Quality** - Debug code, TODOs, comments
6. **Localization** - i18n requirements (if UI changes)
7. **Merge Readiness** - Final assessment and instructions

### Checkpoint Flow

## Context Detection

### Automatic Analysis

The skill automatically detects and analyzes:

```
1. Current branch: feature/XXX-description
2. Extract issue number: XXX
3. Fetch issue from GitHub: gh issue view XXX
4. Load roadmap: docs/planning/0.1.X/ISSUE-XXX-ROADMAP.md
5. Check git status: uncommitted changes, branch sync
6. Identify changed files: git diff develop...HEAD
7. Determine review focus: UI changes, DB changes, logic changes
```

### Initial Output

```
Code Review for Issue #XXX

Preparing systematic review...

Context:
- Branch: feature/XXX-description
- Issue: #XXX - [Title from GitHub]
- Roadmap: docs/planning/0.1.X/ISSUE-XXX-ROADMAP.md
- Base branch: develop
- Changed files: X files, +Y/-Z lines

Focus areas detected:
[✓ UI Changes / ✓ Database Migration / ✓ Service Logic / ✓ Testing]

Review will proceed through 7 systematic checkpoints:
1. Git Status & Branch Verification
2. Roadmap Completion
3. Acceptance Criteria Validation
4. Technical Standards (analyze, tests)
5. Code Quality Checks
6. Localization Verification [if UI changes]
7. Merge Readiness Assessment

Ready to begin systematic review? (y/n)
```

## Checkpoint 1: Git Status & Branch Verification

**Goal**: Ensure clean working state and proper branch alignment

### Automated Checks

```

Command: git status
Expected: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
Status: [✓ Clean / ⚠ Uncommitted changes / ✗ Untracked files]

1.2 - Current Branch:
Command: git branch --show-current
Expected: feature/XXX-description
Status: [✓ Correct / ✗ Wrong branch]

1.3 - Branch Sync with Remote:
Command: git fetch origin && git status
Expected: "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/feature/XXX-description'"
Status: [✓ Up to date / ⚠ Behind / ⚠ Ahead / ✗ Diverged]

1.4 - Sync with Develop:
Command: git fetch origin develop && git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/develop HEAD
Expected: develop is ancestor (no missing commits)
Status: [✓ Up to date / ⚠ Behind develop]

1.5 - Merge Conflicts Check:
Command: git merge-tree $(git merge-base origin/develop HEAD) origin/develop HEAD
Expected: No conflicts
Status: [✓ No conflicts / ✗ Conflicts detected]
```

### Status Indicators

- **✓ PASS**: All checks green, ready to proceed
- **⚠ WARNING**: Minor issues (e.g., ahead of remote, need to push)
- **✗ FAIL**: Blocking issues (uncommitted changes, conflicts)

### Remediation

**If uncommitted changes:**
```
Fix:
1. Review uncommitted changes: git status
2. Either:
   a) Commit them: git add . && git commit -m "message"
   b) Stash them: git stash
   c) Discard them: git restore .

After fixing, re-run checkpoint 1.
```

**If behind develop:**
```
Fix:
1. Update develop: git fetch origin develop
2. Rebase on develop: git rebase origin/develop
3. Resolve conflicts if any
4. Force push: git push --force-with-lease origin feature/XXX-description

After fixing, re-run checkpoint 1.
```

**If merge conflicts detected:**
```

## Failure Remediation Guide

### General Remediation Pattern

```
CHECKPOINT X FAILED: [Checkpoint Name]

Issues Identified:
1. [Specific issue 1]
   Severity: [✗ Critical / ⚠ Warning / ℹ Info]
2. [Specific issue 2]
   Severity: [Level]

══════════════════════════════════════════
REMEDIATION FOR ISSUE 1
══════════════════════════════════════════

Problem: [Detailed description]

Root Cause: [Why it's happening]

Solution Steps:

1. [Step 1 with specific commands]
   Command: [exact command]
   Expected: [expected result]

2. [Step 2]
   Command: [exact command]
   Expected: [expected result]

3. [Verification step]
   Command: [exact command]
   Expected: [expected result]

Estimated Time: [X minutes]

### Common Failures and Remediation

**Flutter Analyze Errors:**
```
Issue: 5 errors, 12 warnings found

Remediation:
1. View all issues: flutter analyze > analyze_output.txt
2. Fix errors first (blocking):
   - Open each file
   - Fix error
   - Save and re-analyze
3. Fix warnings (required for merge)
4. Re-run: flutter analyze
5. Verify: 0 issues

Time estimate: 15-30 minutes depending on complexity
```

**Test Failures:**
```
Issue: 3/618 tests failing

Remediation:
1. Run failing tests with verbose output:
   flutter test test/path/to/failing_test.dart --verbose
2. Identify failure cause from output
3. Common causes:
   - Test data outdated
   - Logic bug in code
   - Test expectations wrong
   - Timing issue (increase timeout)
4. Fix issue
5. Re-run specific test to verify
6. Run full suite: flutter test
7. Verify: All tests passing

Time estimate: 10-60 minutes per test
```

**Acceptance Criteria Not Met:**
```
Issue: Criterion 3 not met - "Feature X works on small screens"

Remediation:
1. Test feature on small screen device/emulator
2. Identify layout issue (overflow, clipping, etc.)
3. Fix responsive layout:
   - Use MediaQuery
   - Add scrolling if needed
   - Adjust constraints
4. Test on multiple screen sizes
5. Re-verify acceptance criterion
6. Update any relevant tests

Time estimate: 30-120 minutes
```

**Localization Issues:**
```
Issue: 3 strings not translated to Portuguese

Remediation:
1. Identify missing strings: [list]
2. Open lib/l10n/app_pt.arb
3. Add translations:
   ```json
   "key1": "Tradução 1",
   "key2": "Tradução 2",
   "key3": "Tradução 3"
   ```
4. Run: flutter gen-l10n
5. Verify: Check both ARB files have same keys
6. Test: Switch app to PT locale and verify

Time estimate: 10-20 minutes
```

## Quality Standards Reference

### Must-Have Standards (Blocking)

**These MUST pass for merge approval:**

- ✗ Flutter analyze: ZERO errors
- ✗ Flutter test: 100% passing rate
- ✗ Critical acceptance criteria: ALL met
- ✗ Backward compatibility: NO breaking changes
- ✗ Data integrity: NO data loss scenarios
- ✗ Security: NO vulnerabilities introduced

### Should-Have Standards (Warning)

**These should pass but can proceed with justification:**

- ⚠ Flutter analyze: Zero warnings (minor warnings acceptable with reason)
- ⚠ Test coverage: Maintained or improved (small decrease acceptable)
- ⚠ Documentation: README updated (can do in follow-up)
- ⚠ Code comments: Complex logic documented (can improve in follow-up)
- ⚠ TODOs: Removed or tracked (non-critical TODOs acceptable)

### Nice-to-Have Standards (Note)

**These improve quality but don't block merge:**

- ℹ Code style: Consistent formatting (automated by formatter)
- ℹ Performance: Optimizations possible (track for future)
- ℹ Additional tests: Edge cases could be added (track for future)
- ℹ Documentation expansion: More examples could help (track for future)

## Success Criteria

The code review succeeds when:

1. ✓ All 7 checkpoints completed systematically
2. ✓ No blocking issues found (or all remediated)
3. ✓ All acceptance criteria explicitly verified
4. ✓ Technical standards met (analyze, tests)
5. ✓ Clear merge decision made (approve/conditional/reject)
6. ✓ Merge instructions provided if approved
7. ✓ User has high confidence in merge safety
