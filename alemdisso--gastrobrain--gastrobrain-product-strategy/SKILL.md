# Gastrobrain Product Strategy & Health

A strategic guidance skill that acts as a combined Product Owner and Tech Lead for Gastrobrain. Provides strategic roadmap planning, priority setting, and project health management to ensure sustainable development that balances user value with technical excellence.

## The Strategic Partner Role

### What This Skill Provides

This skill acts as your strategic partner who:

- **Sees the big picture** beyond individual sprints and tasks
- **Balances competing demands** between features, quality, and technical debt
- **Ensures sustainable velocity** through regular refactoring and testing time
- **Prevents "feature factory" syndrome** where quality work gets neglected
- **Thinks long-term** about architectural evolution and project health
- **Validates priorities strategically** beyond just user requests
- **Recommends when to pause features** for dedicated quality sprints
- **Keeps technical debt** from accumulating to unsustainable levels

### The Missing Role

As a solo developer, you need someone who can:
- Challenge your roadmap when it's unbalanced
- Force strategic thinking about priorities
- Ensure code quality doesn't get sacrificed for features
- Plan technical debt reduction proactively
- Think about architectural sustainability
- Balance short-term delivery with long-term health

**This skill fills that role.**

## When to Use This Skill

### Trigger Patterns

Invoke this skill when you say:
- "Review the roadmap"
- "Help me prioritize the backlog"
- "Is my milestone balanced?"
- "Should I focus on features or quality?"
- "What should I work on next?"
- "Strategic review of 0.X.Y"
- "Planning next quarter"
- "Is it time for a tech debt sprint?"
- "Evaluate project health"
- "Help me plan the next phase"

### Data Sources

**GitHub Project #3** (owner: `alemdisso`) is the single source of truth for issue estimates and project status.

```bash
# Fetch ALL project items with estimates, size, priority, status, milestone
gh project item-list 3 --owner alemdisso --format json --limit 100

# Fetch open milestones for roadmap overview
gh api repos/alemdisso/gastrobrain/milestones?state=open --jq '.[] | {number: .number, title: .title, open: .open_issues, closed: .closed_issues, description: (.description[:200])}'

# Fetch issues for a specific milestone
gh issue list --milestone "0.1.X" --state all --json number,title,labels,state
```

**Key Project fields:** `estimate` (story points), `size` (XS/S/M/L/XL), `priority` (P1/P2/P3), `status` (Ready/In Progress/Done), `milestone`

**Sprint velocity reference:** `docs/archive/Sprint-Estimation-Diary.md` — cruising velocity is **20 points/week**

## Milestone Balance Rules

### The 70/20/10 Rule

**Recommended allocation for sustainable development:**

- **70% User Value** - Features, enhancements, UX improvements that users see
- **20% Quality Work** - Testing, refactoring, tech debt reduction
- **10% Innovation** - Exploration, prototypes, architecture experiments

### Why This Balance Matters

**Too much feature work (>80%):**
- Technical debt accumulates
- Code quality degrades
- Velocity eventually slows
- Developer friction increases
- Bugs become more frequent

**Too much quality work (>40%):**
- Feature delivery slows
- User value delivery delayed
- Momentum lost
- May miss strategic windows

**Just right (70/20/10):**
- Sustainable velocity maintained
- Code stays healthy
- Features deliver consistently
- Technical debt managed proactively
- Developer satisfaction high

### Calculating Balance

```
For milestone with 14 issues (42 points):

Features: 8 issues, 28 points = 67% ✓
Testing: 3 issues, 8 points = 19% ✓
Refactoring: 2 issues, 4 points = 10%
Tech Debt: 1 issue, 2 points = 5%

Quality Work Total: 24% (19% + 10% + 5%)

Assessment: 🟢 HEALTHY (67% features, 24% quality, 9% other)
Close to 70/30 target, sustainable balance.
```

### Balance Thresholds

🟢 **HEALTHY BALANCE:**
- 60-75% user value work
- 25-35% quality work
- 0-10% innovation/exploration

🟡 **ACCEPTABLE BALANCE:**
- 50-60% or 75-80% user value work
- 15-25% or 35-45% quality work
- May be temporarily acceptable if intentional

🔴 **UNBALANCED:**
- <50% or >80% user value work
- <15% or >45% quality work
- Requires immediate adjustment

---

## Priority Scoring Framework

### Strategic Priority Matrix

For each issue, evaluate across 4 dimensions:

#### 1. User Impact (1-5 scale)

**5 - Critical:**
- Blocks core workflows
- Affects all or most users
- Severe pain/frustration
- No workaround available

**4 - High:**
- Affects major workflows
- Affects many users
- Significant pain/friction
- Poor workaround only

**3 - Medium:**
- Affects secondary workflows
- Affects some users
- Moderate inconvenience
- Workaround exists

**2 - Low:**
- Nice-to-have improvement
- Affects few users
- Minor inconvenience
- Easy workaround

**1 - Minimal:**
- Polish/refinement
- Edge case scenario
- Barely noticeable
- Already adequate

#### 2. Strategic Value (1-5 scale)

**5 - Critical:**
- Core to product vision
- Enables major future features
- Competitive necessity
- Improves retention significantly

**4 - High:**
- Aligns strongly with vision
- Enables multiple future features
- Competitive advantage
- Improves retention

**3 - Medium:**
- Aligns with vision
- Enables some future work
- Competitive parity
- May improve retention

**2 - Low:**
- Tangentially related to vision
- Limited future enablement
- Nice-to-have competitively
- Minimal retention impact

**1 - Minimal:**
- Not vision-aligned
- No future enablement
- No competitive impact
- No retention benefit

#### 3. Technical Health (1-5 scale)

**5 - Critical:**
- Eliminates major tech debt
- Significantly improves architecture
- Enables much better testing
- Unblocks future development

**4 - High:**
- Reduces meaningful tech debt
- Improves architecture
- Improves testability
- Reduces friction

**3 - Medium:**
- Maintains current health
- No architecture impact
- Testable but doesn't improve testing
- Neutral impact

**2 - Low:**
- May introduce minor tech debt
- Minor architecture concern
- Testing becomes slightly harder
- Small friction increase

**1 - Minimal:**
- Introduces tech debt
- Hurts architecture
- Makes testing difficult
- Significant friction added

#### 4. Effort Score (Inverted - 1-5 scale)

**5 - Quick (1-2 points):**
- 1-2 story points
- Clear implementation path
- No unknowns
- Quick win

**4 - Small (3 points):**
- 3 story points
- Straightforward implementation
- Few unknowns
- Reasonable effort

**3 - Medium (5 points):**
- 5 story points
- Moderate complexity
- Some unknowns
- Fair effort

**2 - Large (8 points):**
- 8 story points
- Complex implementation
- Several unknowns
- Significant effort

**1 - Epic (13+ points):**
- 13+ story points
- Very complex
- Many unknowns
- Major undertaking

### Priority Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Priority Score = (User Impact × 2) + Strategic Value + Technical Health + Effort Score

Maximum Score: 20 (5 × 2 + 5 + 5 + 5)
Minimum Score: 4 (1 × 2 + 1 + 1 + 1)
```

**Why double User Impact?**
- User value is primary
- Strategic and technical value support it
- Effort normalized to encourage quick wins

### Priority Interpretation

**18-20 points: 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY**
- Do immediately
- High user value + strategic + low effort OR high tech health
- Quick wins or critical fixes
- Example: Critical bug blocking users (5,4,3,5 = 19)

**15-17 points: 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY**
- Include in next sprint
- Strong user or strategic value
- Reasonable effort
- Example: Requested feature with strategic value (4,4,3,4 = 19)

**12-14 points: 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- Backlog for near-term
- Good value but higher effort OR lower value
- Example: Nice feature but expensive (3,3,2,2 = 13)

**8-11 points: ⚪ LOW PRIORITY**
- Backlog for later
- Lower value or very high effort
- May defer indefinitely
- Example: Polish item (2,2,2,3 = 11)

**4-7 points: ⚫ AVOID/DEFER**
- Questionable value proposition
- Very high effort for low return
- Reconsider if worth doing
- Example: Complex feature with minimal impact (2,1,1,1 = 6)

## Roadmap Adjustment Patterns

### When to Recommend Adjustments

#### Add Refactoring Work

**Triggers:**
- Last refactoring >2 sprints ago
- Multiple files >400 lines identified
- Code reviews flagging quality issues repeatedly
- Developers reporting "code friction"
- Velocity declining despite consistent team

**Recommendation:**
Add 1-2 refactoring issues (5-8 points total) to next milestone.

#### Add Testing Work

**Triggers:**
- Test coverage declining trend
- Tests breaking frequently (>10% per sprint)
- New features shipped without tests
- Edge cases discovered but not tested
- Test suite not growing with codebase

**Recommendation:**
Add testing issues to reach 30% quality allocation.

#### Defer Features

**Triggers:**
- Technical debt blocking progress
- Architecture needs strengthening before feature
- Quality metrics declining (🔴 critical status)
- Sprint velocity dropping >20%
- Team experiencing significant friction

**Recommendation:**
Move lower-priority features to next milestone, add quality work.

#### Accelerate Features

**Triggers:**
- Urgent beta user feedback
- Competitive pressure (competitor launched similar)
- Strategic window closing (seasonal, market timing)
- Dependency blocking multiple other features

**Recommendation:**
Move high-priority feature earlier, ensure quality work remains >20%.

### Adjustment Process

**CHECKPOINT 4 Standard Pattern:**

1. **Identify issues to move out:**
   - Lower priority features
   - Nice-to-haves without urgency
   - Polish items that can wait
   - Features with incomplete design

2. **Identify issues to move in:**
   - Critical refactoring needed
   - Testing gaps identified
   - High-priority issues from backlog
   - Create new quality work if needed

3. **Validate capacity:**
   - Total points remain similar
   - Balance improves (closer to 70/20/10)
   - No overload on single sprint

4. **Justify strategically:**
   - Clear rationale for each change
   - Impact analysis provided
   - Long-term benefit explained
