# QA Manager Agent Skill

## Overview

This skill systematizes test execution, failure analysis, debugging, and test suite health monitoring. It acts as a QA specialist who ensures tests run methodically, failures are debugged with structure, fixes are validated thoroughly, and the test suite remains healthy and maintainable.

**Core philosophy:** Testing is a discipline, not an afterthought. Every test execution should be strategic, every failure debugged systematically, and every fix validated against regression. Quality metrics should improve steadily over time.

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger phrases:**

**Test Execution:**
- "Run all tests"
- "Execute test suite"
- "Run tests for [component]"
- "Test the changes"
- "Verify tests pass"
- "Pre-merge test check"

**Debugging:**
- "Debug test failure in [test]"
- "Fix failing test [name]"
- "Why is [test] failing?"
- "Investigate test failures"
- "Tests are broken"

**Health Monitoring:**
- "Check test suite health"
- "Analyze test coverage"
- "Find flaky tests"
- "Review test metrics"
- "Test suite status"

**Use cases:**
1. **Systematic Execution** - Run tests at the right level for the current context
2. **Failure Debugging** - Methodically investigate and fix test failures
3. **Health Monitoring** - Track coverage, flakiness, and suite quality
4. **Regression Prevention** - Ensure fixes don't break existing tests
5. **Coverage Improvement** - Identify and fill test gaps

## The QA Manager Role

**What this skill provides:**

A Quality Assurance perspective that:
- Chooses the right test level for the context (quick vs. full)
- Executes tests systematically with pre-flight checks
- Analyzes failures with structured categorization
- Guides debugging through hypothesis-driven investigation
- Validates fixes with regression testing
- Monitors test suite health metrics
- Detects and remediates flaky tests
- Tracks coverage and identifies gaps
- Maintains test organization standards

**Gastrobrain-specific context:**
- 600+ tests across unit, widget, and integration levels
- MockDatabaseHelper for database isolation
- DialogTestHelpers for dialog testing patterns
- EdgeCaseTestHelpers for boundary testing
- Coverage target: >85%
- Test conventions per CLAUDE.md and testing guides

## Test Execution Strategy

### 4-Level Approach

Choose the appropriate level based on context:

| Level | Scope | Time | When to Use |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| **1: Quick** | Specific tests + analyze | ~30s | During development, quick feedback |
| **2: Component** | All tests in a directory | 2-5 min | After changing a component |
| **3: Full Suite** | All unit + widget tests | 5-10 min | Pre-commit validation |
| **4: Integration** | Everything + E2E | 10-15 min | Pre-merge validation |

### Level Selection Guide

```
What changed?
├── Single file → Level 1 (related tests only)
├── Multiple files in one component → Level 2 (component tests)
├── Multiple components → Level 3 (full suite)
└── Ready to merge → Level 4 (everything)
```

### Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Level 1: Quick Validation
flutter analyze
flutter test test/core/models/meal_test.dart

# Level 2: Component Testing
flutter test test/core/models/
flutter test test/core/services/
flutter test test/widgets/

# Level 3: Full Suite
flutter test

# Level 4: Integration
flutter test
flutter test integration_test/
```

## Failure Pattern Recognition

The QA Manager recognizes common failure patterns and provides targeted guidance.

### Null Safety Violations

```
Pattern: "Null check operator used on a null value"
        "type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'X'"

Common Causes:
1. Missing null check in production code
2. Mock not configured to return expected value
3. Test setup missing required field

Investigation Priority:
1. Check the variable that's null in stack trace
2. Trace where it should have been set
3. Check if mock returns null by default

Typical Fix: Add null check or fix mock setup
```

### Timeout Failures

```
Pattern: "Test timed out after X seconds"
        "pumpAndSettle timed out"

Common Causes:
1. Animation or timer preventing pumpAndSettle from completing
2. Async operation never completing
3. Infinite loop in widget rebuild
4. Missing pump() calls

Investigation Priority:
1. Check for animations (use pump(duration) instead of pumpAndSettle)
2. Verify all Futures complete
3. Check for setState loops
4. Run test in isolation

Typical Fix: Replace pumpAndSettle with explicit pump(duration)
```

### Expectation Mismatches

```
Pattern: "Expected: X  Actual: Y"
        "Expected [X] items, found [Y]"

Common Causes:
1. Production code changed, test not updated
2. Test expectation was always wrong
3. Order-dependent assertion on unordered data
4. Locale/format difference

Investigation Priority:
1. Check git log for recent changes to tested code
2. Verify the expected value is correct
3. Check if data ordering matters
4. Check locale settings in test

Typical Fix: Update expectation or fix production code
```

### Widget Not Found

```
Pattern: "No widget found with key [X]"
        "Finder found zero widgets"

Common Causes:
1. Widget key changed in production code
2. Widget conditionally hidden (guard clause)
3. Widget not yet rendered (needs pump)
4. Looking in wrong widget subtree

Investigation Priority:
1. Verify key/text exists in current code
2. Check conditional rendering logic
3. Add pump() before finder
4. Check widget tree with debugDumpApp

Typical Fix: Update finder or fix rendering condition
```

### State Management Errors

```
Pattern: "setState() called after dispose()"
        "Looking up a deactivated widget's ancestor"

Common Causes:
1. Async callback fires after widget disposed
2. Timer or stream not cancelled in dispose
3. Test navigates away before async completes

Investigation Priority:
1. Check dispose() method for cleanup
2. Check async callbacks for mounted check
3. Verify test awaits all async operations

Typical Fix: Add mounted check or cancel timers in dispose
```

See `frameworks/failure_patterns.md` for the complete catalog.

## Flaky Test Detection

### Detection Approach

When a test fails intermittently:

1. **Run the test multiple times** (10 iterations)
2. **Record pass/fail for each run**
3. **Classify stability:**
   - 10/10 pass = Stable
   - 8-9/10 pass = Possibly flaky (investigate)
   - 5-7/10 pass = Flaky (fix required)
   - <5/10 pass = Broken (not flaky, genuinely failing)

### Common Flaky Test Causes

| Cause | Symptoms | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| Timing dependency | Random timeouts | Use explicit pump durations |
| Shared state | Fails when run with others, passes alone | Isolate test setup |
| Platform dependency | Fails on CI but passes locally | Mock platform-specific code |
| Order dependency | Fails depending on test order | Fix test isolation |
| Network dependency | Fails when network slow | Mock all network calls |

### Remediation Process

```
1. Identify: Run test 10x to confirm flakiness
2. Isolate: Run test alone vs in suite
3. Diagnose: Match symptoms to known causes
4. Fix: Apply targeted fix
5. Verify: Run test 10x again to confirm stability
```

---

## Coverage Analysis

### Interpreting Coverage

| Coverage Level | Assessment | Action |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| >90% | Excellent | Maintain |
| 85-90% | Good (target) | Continue improving |
| 75-85% | Acceptable | Prioritize gaps |
| <75% | Needs work | Create improvement plan |

### Coverage by Component Type

**Priority for coverage:**
1. **Services** (business logic) - Target: >90%
2. **Models** (data integrity) - Target: >90%
3. **Widgets** (UI behavior) - Target: >80%
4. **Screens** (integration) - Target: >70%

### Finding Coverage Gaps

```bash
# Generate coverage report
flutter test --coverage

# View coverage (if lcov available)
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

### What to Cover vs Skip

**Always cover:**
- Business logic and calculations
- Data validation
- Error handling paths
- Edge cases (empty states, boundary values)
- User interactions (tap, input, navigation)

**OK to skip:**
- Simple getters/setters with no logic
- Framework boilerplate (main.dart, route definitions)
- Generated code (l10n, JSON serialization)

---

## Regression Prevention

### Risk Assessment

When fixing a test or production code, assess regression risk:

| Change Type | Risk Level | Regression Scope |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| Test-only fix | Low | Same test file |
| Model change | Medium | All tests using that model |
| Service change | Medium-High | Service tests + widget tests using it |
| Database change | High | All data-dependent tests |
| UI structure change | Medium | Widget tests for that screen |

### Regression Test Strategy

```
Fix Applied
    |
    ├── Re-run failing test (must pass)
    |
    ├── Risk: Low → Run same test file
    ├── Risk: Medium → Run component tests
    ├── Risk: High → Run full suite
    |
    └── Verify: 0 new failures introduced
```

### Regression Checklist

Before marking a fix as complete:
- [ ] Originally failing test now passes
- [ ] All tests in the same file pass
- [ ] All tests in the affected component pass
- [ ] No new failures in the full suite (for medium+ risk)
- [ ] Fix documented if it changes behavior

See `frameworks/regression_prevention.md` for detailed framework.

---

## Test Organization Standards

### Directory Structure

Tests should mirror the `lib/` directory structure:

```

├── core/
│   ├── models/              (model unit tests)
│   │   ├── meal_test.dart
│   │   ├── recipe_test.dart
│   │   └── meal_type_test.dart
│   ├── services/            (service unit tests)
│   │   ├── meal_service_test.dart
│   │   └── recommendation_service_test.dart
│   └── database/            (database tests)
├── widgets/                 (widget tests)
│   ├── meal_type_dropdown_test.dart
│   └── recipe_card_test.dart
├── screens/                 (screen tests)

│   ├── mock_database_helper.dart
│   └── dialog_test_helpers.dart
└── fixtures/                (test data)
```

### File Size Guidelines

| Size | Assessment | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| <100 lines | Fine | Normal |
| 100-300 lines | Good | Typical for comprehensive tests |
| 300-500 lines | Watch | Consider splitting by feature |
| >500 lines | Split | Break into focused test files |

### Naming Conventions

- Test files: `{component}_test.dart`
- Test groups: `group('[ComponentName]', () { ... })`
- Test names: Descriptive present tense - `'displays all meal types'`
- Keys: `{screen}_{element}_field` or `{widget}_{element}_button`
