# Refactoring Skill

## Purpose
Guide systematic code refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and adherence to SOLID principles through checkpoint-driven iterations. Acts as a dedicated code quality specialist focused on keeping the codebase clean and well-organized.

## Gastrobrain-Specific Context

This skill is tailored for the Gastrobrain Flutter/Dart project with specific considerations:

**Project Structure:**
- Flutter application with 600+ test suite
- Service layer pattern with dependency injection via `ServiceProvider`
- Database layer using `DatabaseHelper` with custom exception hierarchy
- Screen/widget architecture with dialog-based interactions
- Localization support (English/Portuguese ARB files)

**Common Refactoring Scenarios:**
- **Long screens** (>500 lines) - Extract widgets, move business logic to services
- **Service consolidation** - Move database operations from screens/dialogs to service layer
- **Dialog refactoring** - Improve dependency injection, extract reusable components
- **Duplicate code elimination** - Particularly in ingredient parsing, meal recording, recipe management
- **Test infrastructure** - MockDatabaseHelper patterns, DialogTestHelpers usage

**Testing Requirements:**
- All 600+ tests must remain passing throughout refactoring
- Use `flutter analyze` for static analysis validation
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Local builds and device testing available via VS Code on Windows; CI/CD also available via GitHub Actions

**Historical Context:**
Reference past successful refactorings as examples:
- Issue #234-237: Dialog database access consolidation to service layer
- Service extraction patterns from god classes
- Screen decomposition into widgets + services

## Trigger Patterns

Use this skill when the user says:
- "Refactor [file/class/screen]"
- "This code needs refactoring"
- "Clean up [component]"
- "Extract service from [screen]"
- "Consolidate [duplicate code]"
- "This file is too long"
- "Break up [god class]"
- "Improve code quality for [component]"

## When to Use
- Files exceeding reasonable length (>300-400 lines)
- Classes/methods with too many responsibilities
- Code duplication across multiple files
- Poor separation of concerns
- Complex methods that are hard to understand
- Technical debt accumulation
- Before major feature additions (clean foundation)
- After rapid prototyping phases

## Prerequisites
- Existing codebase to refactor
- All tests passing (or test coverage for affected code)
- Understanding of the feature's current functionality
- Access to the Flutter/Dart project

## Skill Workflow

### CHECKPOINT 1: Code Analysis & Smell Detection
**Objective:** Identify specific code quality issues and refactoring opportunities

**Actions:**
1. Review target files/modules for code smells:
   - **Long files** (>300-400 lines)
   - **God classes** (classes doing too much)
   - **Long methods** (>50 lines, multiple responsibilities)
   - **Code duplication** (repeated logic across files)
   - **Poor naming** (unclear variable/method names)
   - **Deep nesting** (>3-4 levels)
   - **Feature envy** (methods using other classes' data excessively)
   - **Primitive obsession** (using primitives instead of domain objects)
   - **Large parameter lists** (>3-4 parameters)

2. Analyze dependencies and coupling:
   - Tight coupling between unrelated components
   - Missing abstractions
   - Violation of dependency inversion

3. Check adherence to SOLID principles:
   - Single Responsibility Principle violations
   - Open/Closed Principle violations
   - Liskov Substitution Principle violations
   - Interface Segregation Principle violations
   - Dependency Inversion Principle violations

4. Review test coverage for affected code

**Output:**
- List of specific code smells identified
- Files/classes/methods flagged for refactoring
- SOLID principle violations noted
- Prioritized list of issues (highest impact first)
- **Complexity classification**: Is the length caused by *structural problems* (mixed concerns, god class, business logic in UI layer) or *inherent complexity* (multi-mode dialog, form with many fields, service with many related operations)?
- **Extraction viability**: Are there units that, once extracted, would have a genuinely independent name and responsibility?

**User Confirmation Required:** Does this analysis identify the key problems? Any additional concerns or areas to focus on?

---

### VIABILITY GATE (between Checkpoints 1 and 2)

Before designing a strategy, answer honestly: **If I extracted a piece of this code, would it have a genuinely independent name and responsibility — or would it just be "part of this file, now elsewhere"?**

**If meaningful structural opportunities exist → proceed to Checkpoint 2.**

**If no meaningful extraction is available**, surface this finding and stop:

> "Analysis complete. This file is [N] lines but the length reflects inherent complexity, not structural problems — its concerns are genuinely related and well-organized within the current structure. No structural refactoring is warranted. Cosmetic changes (collapsing multi-line expressions, removing comments, compacting whitespace) would reduce the line count but degrade readability — that is not refactoring. Recommendation: accept the current length."

Typical cases where this applies:
- A multi-mode dialog (e.g., selection view + menu view) where both modes are tightly coupled to shared state
- A form screen where every section already has its own focused builder method
- A service where all methods belong to a single cohesive concern and the length is driven by the domain's natural breadth

---

### CHECKPOINT 2: Refactoring Strategy
**Objective:** Plan the refactoring approach without breaking functionality

**Actions:**
1. For each identified issue, propose refactoring technique:
   - **Extract Method** - break long methods into smaller, named pieces
   - **Extract Class** - split god classes by responsibility
   - **Move Method/Field** - relocate to more appropriate classes
   - **Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants**
   - **Introduce Parameter Object** - group related parameters
   - **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**
   - **Extract Interface** - define contracts for flexibility
   - **Introduce Domain Objects** - replace primitives with value objects
   - **Remove Duplication** - consolidate repeated code

2. Identify dependencies and order of refactoring:
   - Which refactorings must happen first?
   - Which files will be affected?
   - Are there circular dependencies to break?

3. Plan for maintaining test coverage:
   - Which tests need updating?
   - Do new tests need to be written?
   - How to verify behavior preservation?

4. Consider breaking changes:
   - Will public APIs change?
   - How to minimize impact?
   - Migration strategy if needed

**Output:** 
- Specific refactoring plan with techniques for each issue
- Order of refactoring operations
- List of files to be modified/created
- Test strategy to ensure correctness

**User Confirmation Required:** Does this refactoring strategy make sense? Any concerns about the approach?

---

### CHECKPOINT 3: Test Verification Setup
**Objective:** Ensure tests exist and pass before refactoring

**Actions:**
1. Run existing tests for target code
2. Review test coverage:
   - Is coverage sufficient for safe refactoring?
   - Are edge cases tested?
   - Are integration points tested?

3. If coverage is insufficient:
   - Identify critical paths to test
   - Write additional tests for current behavior
   - Run new tests to confirm they pass

4. Document current behavior baseline:
   - What are the expected outputs?
   - What are the success criteria?

**Output:** 
- Test coverage report for target code
- New tests added (if needed)
- All tests passing before refactoring begins
- Behavior baseline documented

**User Confirmation Required:** Are we confident the tests cover the critical behavior? Ready to proceed with refactoring?

---

### CHECKPOINT 4: Incremental Refactoring - Phase 1
**Objective:** Apply first set of refactorings, typically structural changes

**Actions:**
1. Start with highest-priority, lowest-risk refactorings:
   - Extract methods from long functions
   - Rename unclear variables/methods
   - Remove obvious duplication
   - Extract constants for magic numbers

2. Make ONE refactoring change at a time:
   - Apply the change
   - Run tests immediately
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Commit if using Git Flow

3. Keep changes small and focused:
   - Each refactoring should be independently verifiable
   - Avoid mixing multiple refactoring types in one step

4. Maintain functionality:
   - No behavior changes, only structure changes
   - Output must remain identical

**Output:** 
- First round of refactoring applied
- All tests passing
- Code more readable with improved naming/structure

**User Confirmation Required:** Verify changes work as expected. Any issues? Ready for next phase?

---

### CHECKPOINT 5: Incremental Refactoring - Phase 2
**Objective:** Apply deeper refactorings involving class/module restructuring

**Actions:**
1. Apply more substantial refactorings:
   - Extract classes from god classes
   - Move methods/fields to appropriate classes
   - Introduce interfaces/abstractions
   - Break tight coupling
   - Create domain objects to replace primitives

2. Continue one-refactoring-at-a-time approach:
   - Apply change
   - Run tests
   - Verify
   - Commit

3. Update tests as needed:
   - Adjust test structure for new classes
   - Maintain same behavior verification
   - Add tests for new abstractions if helpful

4. Review emerging patterns:
   - Are new patterns reusable?
   - Is architecture improving?
   - Are responsibilities clearer?

**Output:** 
- Major structural improvements applied
- Classes have clearer responsibilities
- Better separation of concerns
- All tests passing

**User Confirmation Required:** Does the new structure feel clearer? Are responsibilities well-separated? Any adjustments needed?

---

### CHECKPOINT 6: SOLID Principle Compliance Review
**Objective:** Verify refactored code adheres to SOLID principles

**Actions:**
1. Review each principle:
   - **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear reason to change
   - **Open/Closed**: Classes open for extension, closed for modification
   - **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes can replace parent types safely
   - **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces are focused and minimal
   - **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

2. Check for remaining violations:
   - Are there still god classes?
   - Are dependencies properly inverted?
   - Are interfaces cohesive?

3. Apply final refinements if needed

4. Verify with tests one more time

**Output:** 
- SOLID compliance assessment
- Final refinements applied if needed
- All tests passing
- Code structure aligned with principles

**User Confirmation Required:** Does the code structure feel solid and maintainable? Any remaining concerns?

---

### CHECKPOINT 7: Documentation & Pattern Capture
**Objective:** Document refactoring decisions and patterns for future reference

**Actions:**
1. Document what was refactored and why:
   - Original problems
   - Refactoring techniques applied
   - Design decisions made
   - Patterns that emerged

2. Update code documentation:
   - Class/method comments if helpful
   - README updates if architecture changed
   - Diagram updates if applicable

3. Capture reusable patterns:
   - What patterns worked well?
   - What can be applied elsewhere?
   - Any anti-patterns to avoid?

4. Note technical debt addressed:
   - Update issue tracker
   - Close related technical debt issues
   - Note remaining tech debt if any

5. Create refactoring report:
   - Before/after metrics (file lengths, method lengths, etc.)
   - Test coverage improvement
   - Complexity reduction

**Output:** 
- Refactoring documentation
- Updated code comments where helpful
- Pattern capture for future use
- Technical debt tracking updated
- Refactoring summary report

**User Confirmation Required:** Is the refactoring well-documented? Ready to merge/close?

## Integration with Other Skills

**Works well with:**
- **Testing Implementation Skill** - Ensure test coverage before/after refactoring, write tests for refactored components
- **Code Review Skill** - Use for systematic review of refactored code before merging
- **Issue Roadmap Skill** - Plan refactoring work as part of issue breakdown
- **Sprint Planning Skill** - Schedule refactoring work proactively to prevent technical debt
- **UX Design Skill** - Refactor before implementing new UX to provide clean foundation
- **Database Migration Skill** - Often paired when database changes require service layer refactoring

**Workflow Position:**
```
Issue Roadmap → Refactoring (if needed) → UX Design → Implementation → Testing
```

**Common Sequences:**
1. **Before feature work**: Refactoring → UX Design → UI Component Implementation
2. **After prototyping**: Implementation → Refactoring → Testing Implementation
3. **Technical debt sprint**: Issue Roadmap → Refactoring → Code Review

**Timing:**
- Use periodically to prevent technical debt accumulation
- Use before major feature additions (clean foundation)
- Use when code smells accumulate (files >300 lines, duplication)
- Use after rapid prototyping (consolidation phase)
- Use when dialog/service patterns emerge across multiple components

## Key Principles

1. **Incremental changes** - One refactoring at a time, verify with tests
2. **Behavior preservation** - Never change functionality during refactoring
3. **Test-first verification** - Tests must pass before and after each change
4. **SOLID adherence** - Guide refactoring with SOLID principles
5. **User checkpoints** - Verify at each phase before proceeding
6. **Documentation** - Capture decisions and patterns for future reference
7. **No premature optimization** - Focus on readability and maintainability, not performance
8. **Readability is the goal** - Line count is a proxy metric for structural problems, not a target. A shorter file that is harder to follow is worse code. Structural improvement that happens to reduce lines is a success; line reduction that degrades clarity is a failure.
9. **Know when to stop** - If analysis reveals no genuine extraction opportunities, report that finding explicitly and stop. Do not substitute cosmetic changes (compacting syntax, removing whitespace, collapsing readable multi-line expressions) for structural refactoring. "No refactoring needed" is a valid and good outcome.

## Common Refactoring Patterns

### Extract Method
```dart
// Before: Long method with multiple responsibilities
void processOrder(Order order) {
  // 50 lines of validation
  // 30 lines of calculation
  // 20 lines of persistence
}

// After: Clear, focused methods
void processOrder(Order order) {
  validateOrder(order);
  final total = calculateOrderTotal(order);
  saveOrder(order, total);
}
```

### Extract Class
```dart
// Before: God class with too many responsibilities
class UserManager {
  void authenticate() { }
  void updateProfile() { }
  void sendEmail() { }
  void generateReport() { }
}

// After: Separate concerns
class AuthenticationService { void authenticate() { } }
class ProfileService { void updateProfile() { } }
class EmailService { void sendEmail() { } }
class ReportGenerator { void generateReport() { } }
```

### Introduce Domain Object
```dart
// Before: Primitive obsession
double calculatePrice(double price, double tax, String currency) { }

// After: Domain objects
class Money {
  final double amount;
  final String currency;
  Money(this.amount, this.currency);
}

Money calculatePrice(Money price, double taxRate) { }
```

### Extract Interface
```dart
// Before: Tight coupling to concrete implementation
class OrderProcessor {
  final MySQLDatabase database;
  OrderProcessor(this.database);
}

// After: Dependency on abstraction
abstract class Database {
  Future<void> save(Map<String, dynamic> data);
}

class OrderProcessor {
  final Database database;
  OrderProcessor(this.database);
}
```

## Code Smell Reference

### Critical (Refactor Immediately)
- Files >500 lines
- Methods >100 lines
- Classes with >10 public methods
- Cyclomatic complexity >15
- Deeply nested code (>5 levels)

### High Priority (Refactor Soon)
- Files >300 lines
- Methods >50 lines
- Obvious code duplication
- God classes with multiple responsibilities
- Large parameter lists (>4 parameters)

### Medium Priority (Refactor When Convenient)
- Files >200 lines
- Methods >30 lines
- Minor duplication
- Unclear naming
- Missing abstractions

## Success Criteria

- Code structure aligned with SOLID principles
- Files under reasonable length (<300 lines typical)
- Methods have single, clear responsibilities (<30 lines typical)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved readability and maintainability
- All tests passing
- Test coverage maintained or improved
- Refactoring decisions documented
- User confirms improved code quality

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Changing behavior while refactoring (keep separate)
- Making too many changes at once
- Refactoring without test coverage
- Over-engineering (keep it simple)
- Neglecting to run tests after each change
- Not committing incrementally
- Mixing refactoring with feature work
- Refactoring for perfection (diminishing returns)
- **Line hunting** - Making syntactic changes (collapsing multi-line expressions into one-liners, removing meaningful whitespace, condensing readable chains) purely to reduce line count. This degrades readability without improving structure. It looks like progress but it's the opposite.
- **Purposeless extraction** - Pulling out private helper methods that have no meaningful independent responsibility, just to shrink the parent file. If the extracted method would only ever be called from one place and has no name that adds clarity, it shouldn't be extracted.

## Metrics to Track

**Before/After:**
- Average file length
- Average method length
- Number of classes with >5 responsibilities
- Code duplication percentage
- Test coverage percentage
- Cyclomatic complexity scores
- Number of SOLID violations

## When NOT to Refactor

- Code is working fine and rarely changes
- Code will be deleted soon
- Under tight deadline (schedule it for later)
- Without adequate test coverage (write tests first)
- Just for the sake of it (refactor with purpose)
- File length is caused by inherent complexity (multi-mode dialog, complex form, service with broad but cohesive responsibility) and the code is already well-organized within each section
- The only available reductions are cosmetic: compacting syntax, collapsing readable multi-line expressions to one-liners, removing meaningful whitespace or comments
