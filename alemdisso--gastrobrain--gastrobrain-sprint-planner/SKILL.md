# Gastrobrain Sprint Planner

A specialized skill for planning development sprints and conducting sprint retrospectives for the Gastrobrain Flutter application using historical velocity data, GitHub Projects issue tracking, and lessons learned from the Sprint Estimation Diary.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Planning a new sprint or release cycle
- Evaluating sprint capacity and feasibility
- Sequencing issues for optimal implementation flow
- Assessing risks in upcoming work
- Calibrating estimates based on historical performance
- Creating a day-by-day sprint breakdown
- Aligning sprint goals with milestone themes
- Conducting a sprint retrospective or review
- Generating a sprint diary entry after completing a milestone
- Analyzing estimation accuracy for a completed sprint

**Do NOT use this skill for:**
- Individual issue estimation (use your judgment based on patterns)
- Long-term roadmap planning (use milestone planning instead)

## Project Context

### Development Environment
- **Project**: Gastrobrain - Flutter meal planning & recipe management app
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive data models
- **Localization**: Bilingual (English, Portuguese-BR) - all features require l10n
- **Testing**: 600+ tests (unit, widget, integration, E2E) - non-negotiable requirement
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub Projects (Project #3) with story points estimation
- **Workflow**: Git Flow (develop → release/X.X.X → master with tags)
- **Team**: Solo developer (no coordination overhead, but no parallel work)

### Story Point Scale
Fibonacci-like scale: **1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13**
- **1 point**: Trivial fix, <1 hour, well-understood pattern
- **2 points**: Simple feature, ~2-3 hours, minor testing
- **3 points**: Standard feature, ~4-6 hours, widget tests required
- **5 points**: Complex feature, ~1 day, full testing suite
- **8 points**: Major feature, ~2 days, architecture changes
- **13 points**: Epic-level work, ~3+ days, significant complexity

### Size Labels (GitHub)
- **XS**: 1-2 points
- **S**: 3 points
- **M**: 5 points
- **L**: 8 points
- **XL**: 13+ points

## Sprint Planning Process

Follow this systematic approach:

### 1. Gather Issue Data

**Primary source: GitHub Project #3** (owner: `alemdisso`). Always use Project fields for story points — never parse estimates from issue bodies.

```bash
# Fetch all project items with estimates, size, priority, status, and milestone
gh project item-list 3 --owner alemdisso --format json --limit 100

# For issue details (body, acceptance criteria, dependencies), use:
gh issue view <number> --json number,title,labels,body,milestone
```

For each issue, extract from Project fields:
- Issue number and title
- Story point estimate (`estimate` field from Project #3)
- Size label (`size` field: XS/S/M/L/XL)
- Priority (`priority` field: P1/P2/P3)
- Status (`status` field: Ready/In Progress/Done)
- Milestone (`milestone` field)
- Type (from labels: feature, bug, refactor, testing, UI/UX)
- Dependencies (from issue body if needed)
- Prerequisites (is prerequisite work complete?)

### 2. Analyze Sprint History Context
Review recent sprints from `docs/archive/Sprint-Estimation-Diary.md`:

**Sprint 0.1.2** (12.2 points → ~11 days, 0.90x ratio):
- Mixed work (architecture, testing, UI)
- Database model changes added overhead
- Discovery work increased effort

**Sprint 0.1.3** (26 points → 10 days, 0.38x ratio):
- Pattern reuse accelerated delivery
- Batched similar work (all testing infrastructure)
- Well-prepared with clear requirements

**Sprint 0.1.4** (12 points → 2 days, 0.17x ratio):
- **OUTLIER**: Prerequisites complete, pure execution
- Well-prepared work, established patterns
- **Do NOT use as baseline** - atypical conditions

**Sprint 0.1.5** (14 points → 6.88 days, 1.98x ratio):
- Hidden overhead from mobile tooling (adb, Android Studio)
- Discovery work (UI iteration, user feedback)
- Database migration complexity underestimated

### 3. Apply Velocity Calibration
**Normal Velocity Range**: 1.1 - 2.8 points/day
- **Conservative estimate**: 2.0 points/day
- **Median estimate**: 2.5 points/day
- **Optimistic estimate**: 2.8 points/day (only if well-prepared)

**DO NOT use Sprint 0.1.4's 6.0 points/day** - it was an outlier with ideal conditions.

### 4. Group and Sequence Issues
Group by:
- **Type**: Feature, bug, refactor, testing, UI/UX, docs
- **Theme**: Related functionality (e.g., all meal planning features)
- **Dependencies**: What blocks what
- **Similarity**: Batch similar work for efficiency

### 5. Calculate Sprint Capacity
**For a 5-day sprint:**
- **Conservative**: 10-12 points (recommended for new features, UI work)
- **Normal**: 12-15 points (established patterns, backend work)
- **Aggressive**: 15-18 points (only if purely extending patterns, no discovery)

**Adjust for work type** (see Velocity Calibration section below)

### 6. Perform Risk Assessment
Flag issues with:
- Incomplete prerequisites
- Hidden overhead potential (UI iteration, mobile tooling)
- Discovery work (new patterns, unclear requirements)
- Database migrations or model changes
- External dependencies (APIs, third-party libraries)
- Testing infrastructure work (vs extending patterns)

### 7. Generate Sprint Plan
Use the template at `templates/sprint_plan_template.md` to create:
- Sprint header (number, theme, dates, capacity)
- Sprint goal (2-3 sentences)
- Issues grouped by theme
- Day-by-day breakdown
- Risk assessment
- Testing strategy
- Success criteria

## Sprint Retrospective Process

Conduct structured sprint retrospectives using 5 checkpoints with developer confirmation between each. The retrospective generates a complete diary entry for `docs/archive/Sprint-Estimation-Diary.md` and updates cumulative metrics.

**When to trigger:** After completing a sprint/milestone, before planning the next one.

### Checkpoint 1: Data Gathering (~5 min)

**Goal:** Collect raw sprint data from multiple sources before interpretation.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Run `scripts/analyze_sprint_commits.py` with sprint date range
- [ ] Fetch story point estimates from GitHub Project #3 (`estimate` field is the source of truth)
- [ ] Fetch issue list with labels and state from milestone
- [ ] Identify sprint boundaries from commits
- [ ] Note any untagged commits for later attribution

**Data to present:**
```bash
# Generate commit analysis
python3 scripts/analyze_sprint_commits.py --since YYYY-MM-DD --until YYYY-MM-DD --branch develop

# Fetch story points and project fields (PRIMARY source for estimates)
gh project item-list 3 --owner alemdisso --format json --limit 100

# Fetch milestone issues (for state and labels)
gh issue list --milestone "0.1.X" --state all --json number,title,labels,state

# Fetch milestone details
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones/{number}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always use the `estimate` field from Project #3 for story points. Do NOT parse story points from issue bodies — they may be outdated or missing. The Project board is the single source of truth for estimates.

**Present to developer:** Raw commit data, issue list, working days summary, daily activity timeline.

**Ready to proceed to Checkpoint 2? (y/n)**

[WAIT for developer confirmation]

### Checkpoint 2: Developer Interview (~10 min) — THE CRITICAL STEP

**Goal:** Gather context that commits don't capture. This prevents the analyst from guessing at intent and attributing fast execution solely to overestimation when genuine efficiency may be a factor.

**Questions to ask:**

**Sprint Boundaries & Structure:**
- Confirm actual sprint start/end dates (commits are a proxy, not the truth)
- Were there any rest days vs no-commit work days?
- How did this milestone relate to adjacent ones? Overlap? Deliberate handoff?

**Hidden Work:**
- Any device testing, planning, or design thinking that left no commit trace?
- Time spent on debugging or tooling issues (adb, Android Studio, etc.)?
- Research or exploration that informed decisions but produced no code?

**Unplanned & Emergent Work:**
- What unplanned work emerged during the sprint?
- Was it healthy UX feedback? Bug discovery? Scope evolution?
- Distinguish: intentional scope expansion vs genuine scope creep

**What Went Well:**
- What efficiency drivers were at play? (pattern reuse, batching, new skills, better tooling)
- Did previous sprint investments pay off? (test infrastructure, refactoring, design tokens)
- Any new capabilities or approaches that accelerated work?

**Blockers & Friction:**
- Anything that slowed down but doesn't show in data?
- Tooling issues, environment problems, unclear requirements?
- Anything you'd do differently next time?

**Present to developer:** Summary of interview notes for confirmation before analysis.

**Ready to proceed to Checkpoint 3? (y/n)**

[WAIT for developer confirmation]

---

### Checkpoint 3: Estimation vs Actual Analysis (~5 min)

**Goal:** Calculate accurate metrics comparing estimates to actuals.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Calculate weighted actual days per issue (using commit analysis + developer context)
- [ ] Map original story point estimates from Project #3 `estimate` field (source of truth)
- [ ] Calculate ratio per issue (weighted actual / estimated)
- [ ] Classify each issue: ✅ On target (0.7-1.3x) / ⚡ Faster (<0.7x) / 🔴 Over (>1.3x) / 📋 Unplanned
- [ ] Calculate accuracy by type (bug, feature, testing, architecture, UI, etc.)
- [ ] Account for hidden overhead identified in developer interview

**Generate table:**

| Issue | Title | Type | Est Points | Weighted Actual | Lines | Ratio | Assessment |
|-------|-------|------|------------|-----------------|-------|-------|------------|
| #XXX | ... | ... | X | X.XX | XXXX | X.XXx | ⚡/✅/🔴/📋 |

**Present to developer:** Estimation vs actual table and accuracy by type summary for validation.

**Ready to proceed to Checkpoint 4? (y/n)**

[WAIT for developer confirmation]

---

### Checkpoint 4: Pattern Recognition & Balanced Assessment (~10 min)

**Goal:** Identify patterns with balanced framing — credit genuine efficiency, don't attribute all fast execution to "bad estimates."

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Identify efficiency gains (pattern reuse, batching, skill improvement, better tooling)
- [ ] Identify genuine overestimation (new work type without calibration data, linked tasks estimated separately)
- [ ] Identify underestimation causes (hidden overhead, discovery work, tooling issues)
- [ ] Analyze working patterns (commit timeline visualization)
- [ ] Assess unplanned work percentage and context (healthy UX feedback vs scope creep)
- [ ] Compare with previous sprint patterns for trend analysis

**Balanced framing guidance:**
- **Fast execution can be BOTH efficiency AND overestimation** — acknowledge both
- **Emergent work is often healthy** — UX feedback loops, bug discovery during testing, scope refinement based on using the product
- **First-time work types** will naturally have conservative estimates — this is expected, not a failure
- **Compound returns** from previous investments (test infrastructure, design tokens, refactoring) should be credited

**Present to developer:** Balanced assessment with:
- Working pattern visualization (commit timeline)
- Efficiency vs overestimation breakdown
- Unplanned work analysis with context
- Comparison to historical sprint patterns

**Ready to proceed to Checkpoint 5? (y/n)**

[WAIT for developer confirmation]

---

### Checkpoint 5: Lessons, Calibration & Documentation (~10 min)

**Goal:** Generate complete diary entry, propose calibration updates, and document recommendations.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Draft lessons learned with balanced framing (typically 5-8 lessons)
- [ ] Propose updates to calibration factors if warranted (with justification)
- [ ] Generate recommendations table for future sprints
- [ ] Compose complete diary entry following established format
- [ ] Draft update to cumulative metrics section
- [ ] Developer reviews complete entry before writing to diary

**Diary entry structure** (use `templates/sprint_review_template.md`):
1. Sprint header (duration, days, utilization, planned/completed issues)
2. Estimation vs Actual table
3. Accuracy by Type table
4. Variance Analysis (major overruns, underruns, on-target, unplanned)
5. Working Pattern Observations (commit timeline visualization)
6. Lessons Learned (numbered, with bold headers and sub-bullets)
7. Recommendations table (Finding → Adjustment)
8. Notes (additional context, deferred work, key achievements)

**Calibration updates** (only if data supports change):
- Update Type-Based Calibration Factors if new work types measured
- Update velocity reference data in Cumulative Metrics
- Add new insights to Critical Insights section
- Revise multipliers only with clear justification

**After developer approval:**
- [ ] Write diary entry to `docs/archive/Sprint-Estimation-Diary.md`
- [ ] Update cumulative metrics section
- [ ] Update document history entry
- [ ] Confirm entry follows established format (compare with 0.1.6 or 0.1.7b)

**Ready to finalize? (y/n)**

[WAIT for developer confirmation before writing to file]

## Sprint History Insights

Key lessons from `docs/archive/Sprint-Estimation-Diary.md`:

### Pattern Reuse Acceleration
**Effect**: 2.5-5x faster than original estimate when reusing patterns
**Indicators**: "Extend existing test infrastructure", "Follow pattern from X"
**Example**: Sprint 0.1.3 testing work (0.38x ratio)
**Action**: Reduce estimates by 60-80% if purely extending patterns

### Hidden Mobile/UI Overhead
**Effect**: 25-35% additional time for tooling, iteration, feedback
**Indicators**: UI polish, mobile-specific features, user-facing screens
**Example**: Sprint 0.1.5 UI iteration (1.98x ratio)
**Action**: Add 1.3-1.5x buffer to UI/mobile estimates

### Well-Prepared vs Discovery Work
**Well-prepared** (0.2-0.3x ratio):
- Prerequisites complete
- Clear requirements
- Established patterns
- Known implementation path

**Discovery work** (1.5-2.0x ratio):
- Unclear requirements
- New patterns needed
- Architecture decisions required
- External dependencies

**Action**: Distinguish implementation effort from discovery overhead

### Bug Fix Patterns
**Known pattern bugs** (0.1-0.2x ratio):
- Clear reproduction steps
- Known root cause
- Familiar code area

**Exploratory bugs** (1.0-1.5x ratio):
- Unclear reproduction
- Unknown root cause
- Multiple potential causes

### Testing Work Categorization
**Extend patterns** (0.2-0.4x ratio):
- Use existing test helpers
- Follow established structure
- Similar to existing tests

**New infrastructure** (1.0-1.5x ratio):
- Create new test patterns
- Build new helpers/fixtures
- Establish new conventions

### Database Migration Complexity
**Simple migrations** (no overhead):
- Add columns with defaults
- Add new tables (no foreign keys)

**Complex migrations** (1.5-2.0x buffer):
- Schema restructuring
- Data migration logic
- Foreign key changes
- Junction table modifications

### Batching Benefits
**Effect**: 20-30% efficiency gain when batching similar work
**Examples**:
- All testing work together
- All UI screens together
- All database changes together
**Action**: Sequence related tasks consecutively

## Velocity Calibration

### Type-Specific Multipliers

Apply these multipliers to story point estimates to get realistic effort:

#### Bug Fixes
- **Known pattern bugs**: 0.1-0.2x (quick fixes with clear path)
- **Exploratory bugs**: 1.0-1.5x (investigation required)
- **Regression bugs**: 0.5-0.8x (code area is familiar)

#### UI/UX Work
- **Backend logic only**: 1.0x (use estimate as-is)
- **UI with existing patterns**: 1.2-1.5x (widget building + testing)
- **UI polish/iteration**: 3.0-4.0x (feedback loops, mobile tooling overhead)
- **New UI patterns**: 2.0-3.0x (design + implementation + testing)

#### Testing Work
- **Extend existing patterns**: 0.2-0.4x (fast, well-understood)
- **New test infrastructure**: 1.0-1.5x (pattern creation overhead)
- **Edge case coverage**: 0.5-0.8x (systematic but tedious)
- **E2E/integration tests**: 1.5-2.0x (setup complexity, flakiness)

#### Architecture/Refactoring
- **Well-prepared refactor**: 0.2-0.3x (clear plan, prerequisites done)
- **Exploratory refactor**: 1.5-2.0x (requires analysis and design)
- **Pattern extraction**: 0.8-1.2x (mechanical but careful)

#### Feature Implementation
- **Established patterns**: 0.8-1.0x (straightforward implementation)
- **New patterns**: 1.2-1.8x (design decisions required)
- **With discovery**: 1.5-2.5x (unclear requirements, iteration)

#### Database Work
- **Simple migrations**: 1.0x (use estimate)
- **Complex migrations**: 1.5-2.0x (data migration, schema changes)
- **Model changes**: 1.2-1.5x (cascade to services, tests)

### Overhead Adjustments

**Add these to base estimate:**

#### Mobile Tooling Overhead
- **Backend-only sprint**: 0% overhead
- **Widget tests only**: 5-10% overhead (basic Flutter test tooling)
- **UI iteration sprint**: 25-35% overhead (adb, device testing, Android Studio)
- **Mobile-specific features**: 20-30% overhead (platform channels, permissions)

#### Localization Overhead
- **Backend work**: 0% (no user-facing strings)
- **New UI screens**: 10-15% (ARB file updates, translation)
- **Error messages**: 5-10% (localization testing)

#### Testing Overhead
- **Unit tests only**: 20-30% of implementation estimate
- **Widget tests**: 40-60% of implementation estimate
- **Integration tests**: 60-80% of implementation estimate
- **E2E tests**: 80-100% of implementation estimate
- **Edge case coverage**: 30-50% additional (per Issue #39 standards)

#### Documentation Overhead
- **Code comments**: 5% of implementation estimate
- **Architecture docs**: 15-20% of implementation estimate
- **API documentation**: 10-15% of implementation estimate

### Sprint Capacity Adjustment Formula

```
Base Capacity = Available Days × Median Velocity (2.5 points/day)

Adjusted Capacity = Base Capacity × (1 - Overhead %) × Work Type Multiplier

Example (5-day sprint, UI-heavy):
Base = 5 × 2.5 = 12.5 points
Overhead = 30% (mobile tooling)
Multiplier = 1.3 (UI iteration average)

Adjusted = 12.5 × 0.7 × 1.3 ≈ 11.4 points

Conservative Target: 10-11 points
```

## Sprint Capacity Guidelines

### Conservative Planning (Recommended)
**10-12 points per 5-day sprint**
- Use when: New patterns, UI work, discovery required
- Risk: Low (high confidence of completion)
- Buffer: 20-30% slack for unknowns
- Best for: Feature sprints, UI polish, new architecture

### Normal Planning
**12-15 points per 5-day sprint**
- Use when: Established patterns, backend work, clear requirements
- Risk: Medium (likely completion with focus)
- Buffer: 10-15% slack
- Best for: Bug fix sprints, pattern extension, refactoring

### Aggressive Planning (Use Sparingly)
**15-18 points per 5-day sprint**
- Use when: Pure execution, prerequisites complete, simple patterns
- Risk: High (requires ideal conditions)
- Buffer: <10% slack
- Best for: Well-prepared work only (rare)
- **Warning**: Only 1 historical sprint achieved this (0.1.4 outlier)

### Capacity Red Flags

**Overcommitment Warning** if:
- Total points > 18 for 5-day sprint (unrealistic)
- >50% of points in UI/discovery work without buffer
- Multiple database migrations in one sprint
- New testing infrastructure + feature work combined
- >3 unrelated themes (context switching overhead)

**Undercommitment Warning** if:
- Total points < 8 for 5-day sprint (may lose momentum)
- All bug fixes with known patterns (consider adding features)
- Missing testing work (did you forget to account for it?)

## Implementation Sequencing Strategy

### Optimal Sequencing Pattern

**Day 1-2: Quick Wins & Prerequisites**
- Start with 1-2 point bugs (build momentum)
- Complete blocking/prerequisite work
- Set up test infrastructure if needed
- Database migrations (get them done early)

**Day 2-3: Main Features**
- Tackle highest-value features when context is fresh
- Batch similar work together (all UI, all backend, all testing)
- Use momentum from quick wins

**Day 4: Integration & Testing**
- Widget tests for features built earlier
- Integration tests across components
- Edge case coverage

**Day 5: Polish & Flex**
- UI polish and iteration
- Documentation updates
- Stretch goals (optional work that can be cut)
- Open-ended work like edge case coverage (Issue #39)

### Sequencing Principles

#### 1. Dependencies First
- Complete blocking work before dependent work
- Database migrations before features using new schema
- Test infrastructure before tests using it
- Service layer before UI using it

#### 2. Batch Similar Work
**Efficiency gain: 20-30%**
- Group all testing work together (shared context)
- Group all UI work together (design decisions consistent)
- Group all database work together (migration planning)
- Group all refactoring together (architectural mindset)

#### 3. Risk Management
- High-risk items in Days 2-3 (time to recover if problems)
- Low-risk items in Days 1 or 5 (flexible timing)
- Discovery work early (inform later decisions)
- Polish work late (can be deferred if needed)

#### 4. Context Preservation
- Keep related features consecutive (avoid context switching)
- Finish one theme before starting another
- Complete feature + tests together (not separated)

#### 5. Energy Management
- Hardest problems when fresh (Days 2-3)
- Mechanical work when tired (Day 5 polish)
- Testing work mid-sprint (requires focus but not creativity)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't:**
- Scatter related work across the sprint (context switching)
- Put discovery work at end (no time to recover)
- Mix database migrations throughout (migration hell)
- Alternate between UI and backend daily (inefficient)
- Save all testing for Day 5 (rush job, poor quality)
- Start with hardest problem (risk momentum loss)

### Example Sequencing

**Bad Sequencing:**
```
Day 1: Feature A (backend)
Day 2: Feature B (UI), Bug C (backend)
Day 3: Tests for Feature A, Feature D (UI)
Day 4: Tests for Feature B, Bug E (database)
Day 5: Tests for Feature D, Database migration
```
*Issues: Constant context switching, migration too late, testing scattered*

**Good Sequencing:**
```
Day 1: Bug C (backend, 2pts), Bug E (database, 1pt), DB migration (1pt)
Day 2: Feature A (backend, 5pts)
Day 3: Feature A tests (3pts), Feature D (UI, 3pts)
Day 4: Feature B (UI, 5pts), Feature B tests (3pts)
Day 5: Feature D tests (2pts), UI polish (flex)
```
*Benefits: Bugs first (momentum), migration early, batched testing, related UI together*

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Categories

#### High Risk
**Indicators:**
- Unclear requirements or acceptance criteria
- No similar prior work (new patterns)
- External dependencies (APIs, libraries, third-party services)
- Database schema restructuring (not just additions)
- Multiple teams/systems involved (rare for Gastrobrain)
- Significant architecture changes

**Mitigation:**
- Add 50-100% time buffer
- Schedule discovery spike before implementation
- Break into smaller, iterative deliverables
- Plan for multiple iteration cycles
- Consider descoping to reduce risk

#### Medium Risk
**Indicators:**
- Some prior work but variations needed
- UI work with iteration expected
- Integration between existing components
- Testing infrastructure for new patterns
- Mobile-specific features (tooling overhead)
- Localization for complex UI

**Mitigation:**
- Add 25-50% time buffer
- Schedule in middle of sprint (time to recover)
- Plan for one iteration cycle
- Allocate time for tooling issues

#### Low Risk
**Indicators:**
- Established patterns (done similar work recently)
- Clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- No external dependencies
- Purely extending existing code
- Backend logic only (no UI)
- Known bug patterns

**Mitigation:**
- Minimal buffer (10-15%)
- Can schedule at sprint start or end
- Good for quick wins

### Risk Identification Checklist

For each issue, ask:

**Requirements Clarity:**
- [ ] Are acceptance criteria clear and specific?
- [ ] Are edge cases documented?
- [ ] Are design decisions already made?
- [ ] Is the "definition of done" explicit?

**Technical Clarity:**
- [ ] Is the implementation approach known?
- [ ] Have we done similar work before?
- [ ] Are all dependencies identified?
- [ ] Are there known technical challenges?

**Dependency Assessment:**
- [ ] Are prerequisites complete?
- [ ] Are external dependencies available?
- [ ] Are blocking issues resolved?
- [ ] Is the codebase in a stable state?

**Overhead Identification:**
- [ ] Does this involve mobile tooling? (25-35% overhead)
- [ ] Does this require UI iteration? (3-4x buffer)
- [ ] Does this need database migration? (1.5-2.0x buffer)
- [ ] Does this need new test infrastructure? (1.0-1.5x buffer)
- [ ] Does this require localization? (10-15% overhead)

**Complexity Signals:**
- [ ] Multiple files modified (>5 files)?
- [ ] Multiple systems integrated?
- [ ] Data model changes with cascading effects?
- [ ] New architectural patterns introduced?

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**For High-Risk Items:**
1. **Descope**: Can we deliver a simpler version first?
2. **Spike**: Should we do a time-boxed investigation first?
3. **Buffer**: Double the estimate to be safe
4. **Defer**: Should this wait until prerequisites are clearer?
5. **Iterate**: Plan for multiple cycles of feedback

**For Medium-Risk Items:**
1. **Buffer**: Add 25-50% to estimate
2. **Schedule wisely**: Days 2-3 for recovery time
3. **Monitor closely**: Daily check-ins on progress
4. **Plan fallback**: What's the MVP if this takes longer?

**For Low-Risk Items:**
1. **Use for quick wins**: Build momentum early
2. **Fill gaps**: Good for end-of-sprint flex time
3. **Batch together**: Efficiency gains from grouping

## Flutter/Testing Specific Considerations

### Flutter Development Overhead

#### Widget Testing Requirements
**Mandatory for all UI features:**
- Widget tree rendering tests
- User interaction tests (taps, scrolls, forms)
- State management tests
- Localization tests (both EN and PT-BR)
- Responsive layout tests (different screen sizes)
- Edge case UI tests (Issue #39 standards)

**Overhead**: 40-60% of implementation estimate
- Simple widgets: 40%
- Complex forms/dialogs: 60%
- Stateful interactions: 50%

#### E2E Testing Requirements
**Required for major features:**
- Full user workflows (recipe creation → meal planning → cooking)
- Database integration tests
- Navigation flows
- Error handling paths

**Overhead**: 80-100% of implementation estimate
- Basic flows: 80%
- Complex multi-screen flows: 100%

#### Edge Case Coverage (Issue #39)
**Required for all new features:**
- Empty states (no data scenarios)
- Boundary conditions (min/max values, zero, negative)
- Error scenarios (database failures, validation errors)
- Interaction patterns (unusual user behaviors)
- Data integrity (consistency across operations)

**Overhead**: 30-50% additional
- Use templates from `docs/testing/EDGE_CASE_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- Reference catalog at `docs/testing/EDGE_CASE_CATALOG.md`

### Database Migration Planning

#### Simple Migrations (Minimal Overhead)
- Add columns with default values
- Add new tables (no relationships)
- Add indexes
- Non-destructive changes

**Buffer**: 0-10%

#### Complex Migrations (Significant Overhead)
- Schema restructuring (rename, reorder)
- Data migration logic (transform existing data)
- Foreign key changes (relationship modifications)
- Junction table changes (many-to-many updates)

**Buffer**: 50-100%
**Action**: Plan migration script, test on copy of production data

### Localization Impact

#### Bilingual Requirements
**All user-facing features must support EN and PT-BR:**
- Update `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`
- Update `lib/l10n/app_pt.arb`
- Run `flutter gen-l10n` after changes
- Test both languages

**Overhead by component:**
- Simple labels: 5% (just ARB updates)
- Error messages: 10% (context-dependent translations)
- Complex UI: 15% (multiple strings, layout testing)

#### Localization Validation
- [ ] No hardcoded strings in code
- [ ] All strings in both ARB files
- [ ] Placeholder formatting correct (`{count}`, etc.)
- [ ] Context provided for translators
- [ ] Both languages tested in UI

### Mobile Tooling Overhead

#### Tooling Issues (From Sprint 0.1.5)
**Hidden overhead: 25-35% for UI-heavy sprints**

**Common issues:**
- ADB connection problems (device not detected)
- Android Studio build failures (Gradle sync issues)
- Hot reload inconsistencies (requires full rebuild)
- Flutter doctor issues (SDK path problems)

**Mitigation:**
- Add 30% buffer for UI-heavy sprints
- Plan for tooling troubleshooting time
- All Flutter commands work locally on Windows (`flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, `flutter build apk`, `flutter run`)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD available as additional validation

### Testing Organization

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit tests**: All business logic, models, services (>80% coverage)
- **Widget tests**: All UI screens and components (>70% coverage)
- **Integration tests**: Major workflows and data flows (key paths)
- **E2E tests**: Critical user journeys (happy path + error path)
- **Edge case tests**: All new features (Issue #39 standards)
- **Regression tests**: All fixed bugs (prevent reoccurrence)

#### Testing Strategy per Sprint Type

**Feature Sprint:**
- Unit tests: 20-30% overhead
- Widget tests: 40-60% overhead
- Edge cases: 30-50% overhead
- **Total testing overhead**: ~100% of implementation

**Bug Fix Sprint:**
- Regression tests: 50-80% overhead (prevent reoccurrence)
- Related test updates: 20-30% overhead
- **Total testing overhead**: ~60-80% of implementation

**Refactoring Sprint:**
- Test updates: 40-60% overhead (maintain coverage)
- New test patterns: If introducing new architecture
- **Total testing overhead**: ~50-70% of implementation

**Testing Infrastructure Sprint:**
- If extending patterns: Use 0.2-0.4x multiplier (fast)
- If new infrastructure: Use 1.0-1.5x multiplier (slower)
- Plan for documentation overhead (15-20%)

## Examples

### Example 1: Mixed Sprint (Features + Testing + Bugs)

**Scenario**: Sprint 0.1.6, 5 days available, mix of feature work and testing

**Issues**:
- Issue #200: Add recipe difficulty filter (5 points, feature)
- Issue #201: Fix meal plan date picker bug (2 points, bug)
- Issue #202: Edge case tests for ingredient management (3 points, testing)
- Issue #203: Improve recipe search performance (3 points, refactor)
- Issue #204: Add serving size adjustment (5 points, feature)

**Total**: 18 points (too high for conservative planning)

**Analysis**:
- Issue #200: New UI feature → 1.5x multiplier → 7.5 adjusted points
- Issue #201: Known bug → 0.2x multiplier → 0.4 adjusted points
- Issue #202: Extend patterns → 0.3x multiplier → 0.9 adjusted points
- Issue #203: Backend refactor → 1.0x multiplier → 3.0 adjusted points
- Issue #204: Complex UI → 1.5x multiplier → 7.5 adjusted points

**Adjusted Total**: ~19.3 points (still too high)

**Recommendation**: Defer Issue #204 (lowest priority) → 12.8 adjusted points ✓

**Sequencing**:
```
Day 1: Issue #201 (bug fix, 0.4 pts) + Issue #203 (refactor, 3 pts)
       → Quick win + backend optimization

Day 2: Issue #200 (filter feature, 7.5 pts)
       → Main feature when fresh

Day 3: Issue #200 tests (widget + edge cases, ~3 pts)
       → Complete feature fully

Day 4: Issue #202 (edge case tests, 0.9 pts) + Buffer
       → Extend patterns, flex time

Day 5: Polish, documentation, stretch goal (Issue #204 if time allows)
```

**Capacity**: 12.8 adjusted points over 5 days = ~2.5 points/day ✓ (matches median velocity)

**Risks**: Medium
- Issue #200 requires UI iteration (mobile tooling overhead)
- Issue #203 performance work may reveal unexpected issues

**Mitigations**:
- 50% buffer on Issue #203 (performance testing time)
- Issue #204 deferred (can pull in if time allows)

### Example 2: UI-Heavy Sprint with Overhead Buffer

**Scenario**: Sprint focused on mobile UI polish, need to account for tooling overhead

**Issues**:
- Issue #210: Redesign meal planning calendar UI (8 points, UI)
- Issue #211: Add recipe image carousel (5 points, UI)
- Issue #212: Improve loading states across app (3 points, UI)

**Total**: 16 points (UI-heavy)

**Analysis**:
- All UI work → Mobile tooling overhead: +30%
- UI iteration expected → 1.5x multiplier on estimates
- Issue #210: 8 × 1.5 = 12 adjusted points
- Issue #211: 5 × 1.5 = 7.5 adjusted points
- Issue #212: 3 × 1.5 = 4.5 adjusted points
- **Subtotal**: 24 adjusted points
- **With overhead**: 24 × 1.3 = 31.2 adjusted points (WAY too high)

**Recommendation**: Do ONE major UI feature per sprint
- Keep Issue #210 only (primary goal)
- Defer #211 and #212 to next sprint

**Revised Plan**:
- Issue #210: Meal calendar redesign (12 adjusted points)
- Add quick wins to fill capacity:
  - Issue #213: Fix calendar date picker bug (1 point, known pattern → 0.2 adjusted)
  - Issue #214: Update calendar localization (2 points, ARB updates → 2 adjusted)

**Total**: 14.2 adjusted points ✓

**Sequencing**:
```
Day 1: Issue #213 (bug fix) + Design review for Issue #210
       → Quick win + planning

Day 2-3: Issue #210 implementation (calendar UI redesign)
         → Main feature, expect iteration

Day 4: Issue #210 testing (widget tests, both languages)
       → Comprehensive testing

Day 5: Issue #214 (localization) + UI polish iteration
       → Cleanup + respond to testing findings
```

**Risks**: High
- UI iteration unpredictable (user feedback, design changes)
- Mobile tooling overhead (adb issues, emulator problems)
- Calendar component is complex (date handling, state management)

**Mitigations**:
- 30% tooling overhead buffer already applied
- Defer #211 and #212 (scope flexibility)
- Plan for multiple iteration cycles
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD builds (additional validation)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Calendar UI matches design mockups
- [ ] All date interactions work correctly
- [ ] Both EN and PT-BR tested
- [ ] Widget tests cover calendar component
- [ ] Edge cases tested (empty meals, future dates)
- [ ] No performance regressions

### Example 3: Optimal Sequencing Demonstration

**Scenario**: Sprint with diverse work types, show optimal sequencing

**Issues**:
- Issue #220: Database migration for recipe tags (2 points, database)
- Issue #221: Add tag filtering to recipe list (5 points, feature)
- Issue #222: Tag management UI (5 points, UI)
- Issue #223: Fix recipe deletion bug (1 point, bug)
- Issue #224: Edge case tests for tags (3 points, testing)

**Total**: 16 points

**Analysis**:
- Issue #220: Database migration → Do first (prerequisite for #221, #222)
- Issue #221: Backend feature → Depends on #220
- Issue #222: UI feature → Depends on #221 (needs tag filtering)
- Issue #223: Known bug → Quick win
- Issue #224: Extend test patterns → Low complexity

**Adjusted estimates**:
- Issue #220: 2 × 1.0 (simple migration) = 2 points
- Issue #221: 5 × 0.8 (backend pattern) = 4 points
- Issue #222: 5 × 1.5 (UI work) = 7.5 points
- Issue #223: 1 × 0.2 (known bug) = 0.2 points
- Issue #224: 3 × 0.3 (extend patterns) = 0.9 points

**Total**: 14.6 adjusted points ✓

**Optimal Sequencing** (by dependency + type batching):
```
Day 1: Issue #223 (bug, 0.2 pts) + Issue #220 (DB migration, 2 pts)
       → Quick win + prerequisite work
       → Rationale: Bug first for momentum, migration early (risky if late)

Day 2: Issue #221 (tag filtering backend, 4 pts)
       → Feature implementation (depends on Day 1 migration)
       → Rationale: Backend work when fresh

Day 3: Issue #221 tests + Issue #222 start (UI, ~3.5 pts)
       → Complete backend feature, start UI
       → Rationale: Finish before moving on, batch UI work

Day 4: Issue #222 continue (UI, ~4 pts)
       → Complete tag management UI
       → Rationale: Keep UI work together (design context)

Day 5: Issue #224 (tag edge case tests, 0.9 pts) + Polish
       → Testing work at end (can cut if needed)
       → Rationale: Open-ended work as flex time
```

**Why This Sequencing Works**:
1. **Dependencies respected**: Migration → Backend → UI (logical flow)
2. **Type batching**: Backend Day 2, UI Days 3-4, Testing Day 5
3. **Risk management**: Migration early (time to fix if issues)
4. **Quick win first**: Bug fix builds momentum
5. **Flex at end**: Testing can be cut/deferred if schedule slips

**Alternative (Bad) Sequencing**:
```
Day 1: Issue #222 (UI) - FAILS, needs backend from #221
Day 2: Issue #221 (backend) - FAILS, needs migration from #220
Day 3: Issue #220 (migration) - Too late if issues found
Day 4: Issue #223 (bug) + Issue #224 (tests) - Context switch
Day 5: Rework Days 1-2 - Sprint failure
```

**Why Alternative Fails**:
- Dependencies backwards (UI before backend before migration)
- Risky work too late (migration on Day 3)
- No momentum building (no quick wins)
- Constant context switching (bug and tests together)

## Continuous Improvement

After each sprint:
1. **Run the Sprint Retrospective Process** (5 checkpoints above) to generate a diary entry
2. **Update Sprint Estimation Diary** with the generated entry (CP5 output)
3. **Calculate effort ratio** for sprint and update cumulative metrics
4. **Identify new patterns** in velocity data through developer interview (CP2)
5. **Refine multipliers** based on balanced assessment (CP4)
6. **Update this skill** with new insights and calibration factors

**The skill should evolve** as more sprint data becomes available. The retrospective process ensures each sprint's learnings are captured systematically and feed directly into the next sprint's planning.
