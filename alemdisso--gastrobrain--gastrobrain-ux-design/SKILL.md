# Gastrobrain UX Design

A specialized skill for user experience design work in the Gastrobrain Flutter application. Acts as a UX specialist who thinks through user flows, information architecture, and interface semantics **before** implementation begins.

## When to Use This Skill

### Trigger Patterns

Use this skill when the user says:
- "Design the UX for #XXX"
- "Help me redesign [screen name]"
- "What should the user flow be for [feature]?"
- "I need wireframes for #XXX"
- "Help me think through the information architecture"
- "How should this feature work from a UX perspective?"
- "Plan the user experience for #XXX"

### Workflow Position

```
Issue Roadmap → UX Design → UI Component Implementation
```

This skill sits **between** planning and coding:
- **After Issue Roadmap**: You know WHAT to build
- **Before UI Component Implementation**: You design HOW users will experience it

### Automatic Actions

When triggered:
1. **Fetch issue details** if GitHub issue number provided
2. **Analyze user goals** and context
3. **Guide through 6 checkpoints** one at a time
4. **Generate design artifacts** at each checkpoint
5. **Wait for user confirmation** before proceeding

### Do NOT Use This Skill

- ❌ For writing actual Flutter widget code (use `gastrobrain-ui-component` instead)
- ❌ For applying styling/colors (use `gastrobrain-ui-polish` instead)
- ❌ For writing tests (use `gastrobrain-testing-implementation` instead)
- ✅ **Focus on conceptual design** before implementation

## Project Context

### Development Environment
- **Project**: Gastrobrain - Flutter meal planning & recipe management app
- **Platform**: Mobile-first (iOS, Android) with responsive layouts
- **Localization**: Bilingual (English, Portuguese-BR)
- **Users**: Home cooks who want organized, cultured meal planning
- **Design Identity**: "Cultured & Flavorful" (see Visual Identity section)

### Design Principles

#### "Cultured & Flavorful" Identity
Gastrobrain is **not** a generic meal planner - it's a sophisticated cooking companion.

**Core attributes**:
- **Warm & earthy**: Inspired by Brazilian ingredients (vibrant but grounded)
- **Generous whitespace**: Confident, not cramped (like a well-plated dish)
- **Clear hierarchy**: Cultured typography, intentional information design
- **Inviting but confident**: Welcoming to novices, respected by experienced cooks

**Visual language**:
- **Colors**: Warm terracotta, olive green, saffron yellow, cocoa brown
- **Spacing**: 16-24px standard gaps, 32-48px section breaks
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy (24pt headers → 16pt body → 12pt labels)
- **Cards**: Elevated, rounded corners (8-12px radius), subtle shadows

#### Mobile-First Considerations
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44x44px (iOS HIG standard)
- **Thumb zones**: Primary actions within bottom 2/3 of screen
- **One-handed use**: Critical paths accessible with thumb reach
- **Responsive**: Graceful layout shifts for tablets

#### Accessibility Standards
- **Screen reader support**: Semantic widgets, meaningful labels
- **Color contrast**: WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 for text)
- **Touch targets**: No overlapping, clear spacing
- **Error states**: Visual + text feedback (not color alone)

## UX Design Process (6 Checkpoints)

Follow this systematic approach - **one checkpoint at a time, wait for user confirmation**.

### CHECKPOINT 3/6: User Flow Mapping

**Purpose**: Map the step-by-step user journey through the feature

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Map primary user flow (happy path)
- [ ] Identify decision points and branches
- [ ] Map error paths (what if something fails?)
- [ ] Map edge cases (empty states, first-time use, etc.)
- [ ] Identify entry points (how users reach this feature)
- [ ] Identify exit points (where users go after)

**Questions to answer**:
1. What's the step-by-step journey for the primary use case?
2. Where do users make decisions (branches)?
3. What happens if data is empty/missing?
4. What happens if actions fail?
5. How do users enter and exit this flow?

**Artifact to produce**:
```markdown
## User Flow Map

**Primary Flow** (Happy Path):
1. [Entry point] User navigates from [screen/action]
2. [Step 1] User sees [screen/state]
3. [Step 2] User interacts with [element]
4. [Step 3] System responds with [feedback]
5. [Exit point] User proceeds to [screen/action]

**Decision Points**:
- **At step [X]**: If [condition], then [branch A], else [branch B]
- **At step [Y]**: User chooses between [option 1] / [option 2] / [option 3]

**Error Paths**:
- **If [error type]**: Show [error message], allow [recovery action]
- **If [validation fails]**: Highlight [field], show [inline error]

**Edge Cases**:
- **Empty state**: [What user sees with no data]
- **First-time use**: [Any onboarding or guidance]
- **Loading state**: [What displays during data fetch]
- **Offline**: [Behavior if no network - if applicable]

**Navigation**:
- **Entry**: [How users reach this feature]
- **Exit**: [Where users go when done]
```

**Verification**:
- Primary flow is clear and logical
- All decision points identified
- Error handling considered
- Edge cases mapped

**Ready to proceed to Checkpoint 4? (y/n)**

### CHECKPOINT 4/6: Information Architecture

**Purpose**: Define content hierarchy and organization

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Identify all content elements needed on screen
- [ ] Establish hierarchy (primary/secondary/tertiary)
- [ ] Group related elements logically
- [ ] Decide what's visible vs. hidden (progressive disclosure)
- [ ] Check alignment with "Cultured & Flavorful" identity
- [ ] Ensure content supports user goals (remove unnecessary elements)

**Questions to answer**:
1. What information does the user need to see?
2. What's the most important element? (primary focus)
3. What's supporting context? (secondary elements)
4. What can be hidden until needed? (progressive disclosure)
5. Does this feel *cultured* or generic?

**Design identity check**:
- ❓ Is there **generous whitespace** or does it feel cramped?
- ❓ Is the **hierarchy clear** or does everything compete for attention?
- ❓ Does it feel **warm and inviting** or clinical?
- ❓ Would a sophisticated home cook **respect** this interface?

**Artifact to produce**:
```markdown
## Information Architecture

**Content Inventory** (all elements needed):
- [Element 1]
- [Element 2]
- [Element 3]
- ...

**Hierarchy**:

**Primary** (main focus, largest/boldest):
- [Primary element - what user came here for]

**Secondary** (supporting context, medium emphasis):
- [Supporting element 1]
- [Supporting element 2]

**Tertiary** (metadata, subtle):
- [Label/metadata 1]
- [Label/metadata 2]

**Progressive Disclosure**:
- **Hidden until needed**: [Collapsed sections, overflow menus, etc.]
- **Revealed on interaction**: [Expandable details, tooltips, etc.]

**Grouping**:
- **Group 1 - [Name]**: [Elements that belong together]
- **Group 2 - [Name]**: [Elements that belong together]

**Visual Identity Check** ✓:
- [X] Generous whitespace (not cramped)
- [X] Clear hierarchy (primary element stands out)
- [X] Warm & inviting (not clinical)
- [X] Cultured feel (sophisticated, intentional)
```

**Verification**:
- Clear hierarchy (not everything equal importance)
- Content supports user goals (no fluff)
- Logical grouping
- Feels "Cultured & Flavorful" (not generic)

**Ready to proceed to Checkpoint 5? (y/n)**

### CHECKPOINT 5/6: Wireframe & Interaction Design

**Purpose**: Define screen structure and interaction behavior

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create wireframe representation (ASCII art or detailed text description)
- [ ] Specify component types (buttons, cards, lists, inputs, etc.)
- [ ] Define spacing and visual rhythm
- [ ] Map tap targets and gestures
- [ ] Specify transitions and feedback
- [ ] Define loading and error states visually

**Wireframe representation options**:
1. **ASCII art** - Quick visual sketch using text characters
2. **Detailed text description** - Layer-by-layer layout description
3. **Hybrid** - ASCII for structure + text for details

**Questions to answer**:
1. What's the overall layout structure?
2. What Flutter components are best for each element?
3. How does spacing create visual rhythm?
4. What happens when user taps/swipes/long-presses?
5. What visual feedback confirms actions?

**Artifact to produce**:
```markdown
## Wireframe & Interaction Design

**Layout Structure** (ASCII wireframe):

## Visual Identity Reference

### "Cultured & Flavorful" Design Language

**NOT** a generic meal planner - Gastrobrain is a sophisticated cooking companion.

#### Color Palette (Warm & Earthy)
Inspired by Brazilian ingredients:
- **Terracotta**: #D4755F (warm clay, primary accent)
- **Olive Green**: #6B8E23 (fresh herbs, secondary accent)
- **Saffron Yellow**: #F4C430 (warm spice, highlights)
- **Cocoa Brown**: #3E2723 (rich earth, dark text)
- **Cream**: #FFF8DC (warm white, backgrounds)
- **Charcoal**: #2C2C2C (refined dark, headers)

#### Spacing System (Generous Whitespace)
Confident, not cramped - like a well-plated dish:
- **Micro**: 4px (icon-text gaps)
- **Small**: 8px (tight groupings)
- **Standard**: 16px (screen padding, card gaps)
- **Medium**: 24px (section breaks)
- **Large**: 32px (major section breaks)
- **XLarge**: 48px (hero sections)

#### Typography Hierarchy (Clear & Cultured)
- **Hero**: 32pt, bold (page titles, major headers)
- **Header**: 24pt, bold (section headers)
- **Subheader**: 18pt, medium (subsections)
- **Body**: 16pt, regular (primary content)
- **Label**: 12pt, medium (metadata, captions)
- **Caption**: 10pt, regular (footnotes, helper text)

#### Card Design (Elevated & Inviting)
- **Border radius**: 12px (friendly, approachable)
- **Elevation**: 2-4 (subtle shadow, not heavy)
- **Padding**: 16px (generous internal space)
- **Margins**: 16px horizontal, 12px vertical
- **Background**: Cream (#FFF8DC) or white

#### Interaction Feel (Responsive & Delightful)
- **Animations**: 200-300ms (smooth, not sluggish)
- **Ripple effects**: InkWell on all tappable elements
- **Transitions**: Material page routes (platform-appropriate)
- **Feedback**: Immediate visual response (no dead taps)

### Design Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't**:
- ❌ Use cold blues/grays (feels clinical, not warm)
- ❌ Cram content (no breathing room = generic app)
- ❌ Use flat hierarchy (everything competing for attention)
- ❌ Use generic icons without context (lazy design)
- ❌ Ignore whitespace (cramped = cheap)
- ❌ Use harsh shadows (aggressive, not inviting)
- ❌ Use robotic copy (be warm and conversational)

**Do**:
- ✅ Embrace warm, earthy tones (Brazilian ingredient inspiration)
- ✅ Give content room to breathe (confident spacing)
- ✅ Establish clear hierarchy (guide the eye)
- ✅ Use context-aware labels (helpful, not cryptic)
- ✅ Respect whitespace (sophistication through restraint)
- ✅ Use subtle elevation (depth without aggression)
- ✅ Write friendly copy (cultured, not pretentious)

## Flutter-Specific Guidelines

### Recommended Widgets by Use Case

**Screens & Layout**:
- **Scaffold**: All full-screen layouts
- **AppBar**: Standard top navigation
- **SafeArea**: Respect device notches/insets
- **SingleChildScrollView**: Scrollable content
- **CustomScrollView**: Complex scrolling (slivers)

**Lists & Collections**:
- **ListView.builder**: Dynamic lists (performance)
- **GridView**: Grid layouts
- **Card**: Content containers
- **ExpansionTile**: Collapsible sections

**Forms & Input**:
- **Form**: Form validation wrapper
- **TextFormField**: Text inputs with validation
- **DropdownButton**: Select from options
- **Checkbox / Radio / Switch**: Boolean/choice inputs

**Actions**:
- **ElevatedButton**: Primary actions
- **TextButton**: Secondary actions
- **IconButton**: Icon-only actions
- **FloatingActionButton**: Primary screen action

**Feedback & State**:
- **SnackBar**: Transient messages
- **Dialog**: Blocking confirmations
- **CircularProgressIndicator**: Loading spinner
- **LinearProgressIndicator**: Progress bar

**Navigation**:
- **BottomNavigationBar**: Primary navigation (3-5 items)
- **Drawer**: Secondary navigation / settings
- **TabBar**: Sub-navigation within screen

### Responsive Design Patterns

**Mobile (< 600dp)**:
- Single column layout
- Full-width cards
- Bottom navigation
- FAB for primary action

**Tablet (600-900dp)**:
- Two-column layout (master-detail)
- Side navigation (drawer always visible)
- Larger touch targets (48x48 → 56x56)

**Desktop (> 900dp)** *(future consideration)*:
- Three-column layout
- Persistent side nav
- Hover states
- Keyboard shortcuts

### Platform-Specific Considerations

**iOS**:
- Cupertino widgets for native feel (if desired)
- Swipe-back navigation
- Haptic feedback (HapticFeedback.lightImpact)
- Modal sheets slide from bottom

**Android**:
- Material Design 3 components
- Ripple effects (InkWell)
- Floating Action Button convention
- Navigation drawer

**Both**:
- Platform-adaptive widgets (adaptive_components package)
- Respect platform conventions
- Test on both platforms

## Common UX Patterns in Gastrobrain

### Recipe Browsing
- **Card-based list**: Recipe cards with image, title, meta
- **Filters**: Dropdown/chip filters (meal type, difficulty)
- **Search**: Debounced search bar (300ms delay)
- **Empty state**: "No recipes found" with action to add

### Meal Planning
- **Calendar view**: Weekly grid with meal slots
- **Drag-and-drop**: Assign recipes to days/meals
- **Multi-select**: Add multiple side dishes
- **Quick actions**: Swipe gestures for common actions

### Forms & Dialogs
- **Validation**: Inline errors below fields
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show advanced options on toggle
- **Autosave**: Debounced save (500ms after typing stops)
- **Cancel confirmation**: Warn if unsaved changes

### Navigation Patterns
- **Hierarchical**: Home → List → Detail → Edit
- **Tab-based**: Main sections (Recipes, Meals, Shopping)
- **Modal**: Dialogs for focused tasks (add, edit, confirm)
- **Back navigation**: Preserve user context (return to filtered list)

## Edge Cases to Consider

Every UX design should address:

### Empty States
- **No data**: First-time user or empty collection
- **No results**: Search/filter returned nothing
- **Offline**: No network connection (if applicable)

### Boundary Conditions
- **Very long text**: Recipe names, ingredient lists
- **Very short text**: Single-word titles
- **Large numbers**: High serving counts, many ingredients
- **Zero values**: 0 servings, 0 ingredients (prevent if invalid)

### Error Scenarios
- **Network errors**: Failed API calls (if applicable)
- **Validation errors**: Invalid form inputs
- **Database errors**: Failed save/load operations
- **Permission errors**: Missing camera/storage access (if applicable)

### Interaction Patterns
- **Rapid tapping**: Prevent double-submit
- **Orientation change**: Preserve state on rotate
- **Background return**: Resume where user left off
- **Interruptions**: Phone call, notification

### Data Integrity
- **Concurrent edits**: Handle stale data
- **Orphaned records**: Delete cascades properly
- **Undo**: Allow reversal of destructive actions

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Invoke the Skill
```
User: "Design the UX for #285 - weekly meal planning screen"
```

### Step 2: Fetch Context
If GitHub issue provided, fetch details:
```bash
gh issue view 285
```

### Step 3: Execute Checkpoints
Run each checkpoint **one at a time**:
1. Generate artifact for checkpoint
2. Wait for user confirmation
3. Proceed to next checkpoint

**Never skip ahead** - each checkpoint builds on previous.

### Step 4: Produce Artifacts
At each checkpoint, generate complete markdown artifact (not just notes).

### Step 5: Handoff to Implementation
After Checkpoint 6, summarize all artifacts and provide implementation checklist.

## Examples

### Example 1: New Feature Design

**User**: "Design the UX for adding recipe tags and filtering by tags"

**Skill Response**:

```
CHECKPOINT 1/6: Goal & Context Analysis

I'll help you design the UX for recipe tags and filtering. Let me start by understanding the user goals.

## Goal & Context

**User Goal**: Users want to organize their recipes by custom categories (e.g., "quick weeknight", "fancy dinner", "kid-friendly") and quickly filter to find recipes matching those tags.

**Pain Point**: Currently, users can only filter by predefined meal type (breakfast/lunch/dinner) and difficulty. They have no way to create their own organizational system for recipes.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Users can create custom tags (e.g., "vegetarian", "under 30 min")
- [ ] Users can assign multiple tags to a recipe
- [ ] Users can filter recipe list by one or more tags
- [ ] Tag filtering feels fast and intuitive (no slow searches)

**Scope**: New feature - tag management + filtering UI

Ready to proceed to Checkpoint 2? (y/n)
```

[User confirms]

```
CHECKPOINT 2/6: Current State Assessment

Since this is a new feature, I'll briefly assess the existing recipe browsing UI to maintain consistency.

## Current State Assessment

**What exists**: Recipe list screen with card-based layout, dropdown filters for meal type and difficulty, search bar.

**What works** ✅:
- Card-based recipe list is scannable and visual
- Dropdown filters are familiar and easy to use
- Search bar is prominent and discoverable

**What doesn't work** ❌:
- Limited filtering options (only 2 predefined filters)
- No way to save custom filter combinations
- Filter bar feels cluttered when both filters active

**Design patterns to maintain**:
- Card-based recipe list (Material Card widget)
- Filter chips above list (Chip widgets in Wrap)
- Pull-to-refresh on recipe list
- FloatingActionButton for "Add Recipe"

**Approach**: Evolutionary improvement - add tag filter alongside existing filters, reuse chip-based UI pattern

Ready to proceed to Checkpoint 3? (y/n)
```

### Example 2: Redesign Existing Screen

**User**: "Help me redesign the meal planning calendar - it feels cramped and hard to read"

**Skill Response**:

```
CHECKPOINT 1/6: Goal & Context Analysis

I'll help you redesign the meal planning calendar for better readability.

## Goal & Context

**User Goal**: Users want to see their weekly meal plan at a glance and quickly understand what's planned for each day without squinting or tapping to expand.

**Pain Point**: Current calendar feels cramped - recipe names are truncated, meal type labels compete for attention, and overall hierarchy is unclear. Users report it "feels generic" and "hard to scan quickly."

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Users can read recipe names without truncation (at least first 25 characters)
- [ ] Clear visual distinction between days and meal slots
- [ ] Meal type (breakfast/lunch/dinner) is obvious at a glance
- [ ] Empty meal slots are inviting (not just blank space)
- [ ] Overall feel is "cultured and organized" (not cramped and generic)

**Scope**: Redesign of weekly meal planning calendar screen

CHECKPOINT 2/6: Current State Assessment

Let me review the current calendar implementation to identify what to preserve and what to fix.

## Current State Assessment

**What exists**: Grid layout showing 7 days x 3 meals, recipe names in small text, dropdown icons to assign recipes.

**What works** ✅:
- Shows all 7 days at once (week-at-a-glance)
- Clear column headers for days of week
- Quick tap to assign recipe (dropdown)

**What doesn't work** ❌:
- Typography hierarchy unclear (day, meal type, recipe all similar size)
- Recipe names truncated after ~15 characters (...unable to read)
- No breathing room - 8px padding feels cramped
- Empty slots are just gray boxes (uninviting)
- Feels generic - could be any calendar app

**Design patterns to maintain**:
- Week-at-a-glance view (users like seeing full week)
- Tap-to-assign interaction (familiar)
- Day headers with date (context)

**Approach**: Evolutionary redesign - keep grid structure, improve typography hierarchy, add generous whitespace, make empty states inviting

## Success Metrics

How we know this skill is working:

- ✅ Fewer "wait, this screen doesn't make sense" moments during implementation
- ✅ Clear design direction before writing any Flutter widgets
- ✅ Screens feel intentional and cohesive (not haphazard)
- ✅ Consistent "Cultured & Flavorful" identity across features
- ✅ Accessibility considerations baked in from the start
- ✅ Smooth handoff to UI Component Implementation skill (no ambiguity)

## Continuous Improvement

After using this skill:
1. **Capture learnings**: What design patterns worked well?
2. **Update references**: Add new patterns to `common-patterns.md`
3. **Refine checkpoints**: Were any checkpoints too detailed or too shallow?
4. **Gather feedback**: Did implementation match design intent?
5. **Evolve identity**: Does "Cultured & Flavorful" need refinement?

**This skill should evolve** as design patterns mature.
