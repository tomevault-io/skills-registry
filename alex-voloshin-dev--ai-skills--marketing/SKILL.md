# Marketing

End-to-end marketing workflow with two phases: **Init** (one-time strategy setup) and **Execute** (recurring marketing operations). Owns the `marketing/` directory for all materials.

**⚠️ CONSTRAINT: This workflow NEVER modifies source code (*.java, *.ts, *.tsx, *.py, *.go), configs (*.yaml, *.yml, *.json), infrastructure (*.tf, Dockerfile, Helm), or dependency files (pom.xml, package.json, requirements.txt). Marketing workflow creates and edits only markdown files in the `marketing/` directory.**

## Phase Selection

Ask the user:

- **`init`** — First-time setup: gather context, define strategy, create MARKETING.md
- **`execute`** — Run a specific marketing operation (social post, blog, email, trend research, etc.)

If `marketing/MARKETING.md` does not exist → start with `init` regardless.

---

## Phase 1: Init

### 1. Gather Project Context

**Apply `Agent(product-manager)` + `Agent(marketing-strategist)`.**

Read `AGENTS.md` at the project root for product description, domain, and team structure before defining marketing strategy.

1. **Read project files**:
   - `AGENTS.md` — tech stack, project purpose
   - `README.md` — product description
   - `FEATURES.md` (if exists) — feature inventory
   - Website/landing page (if URL known) — current positioning
2. **Read existing marketing materials** (if any):
   - `marketing/` directory contents
   - Blog posts directory
   - Any existing brand guidelines
3. **Summarize findings**: product type, target market signals, existing messaging, content gaps.

### 2. User Interview

Present the **Marketing Setup Questionnaire** from `marketing-operations` skill (`marketing-setup-template.md`). Gather:

<questionnaire>
**Product and Market**:
- Product name and one-line description
- Target audience (who buys/uses this?)
- Key problem you solve
- Top 3 competitors or alternatives (including "do nothing")
- Current stage (pre-launch / launched / growing / mature)

**Goals and Metrics**:
- Primary marketing goal (awareness / leads / signups / revenue)
- Target metrics (e.g., X signups/month, Y website visitors)
- Budget constraints (free/organic only, small budget, significant budget)
- Timeline (when do you need results?)

**Channels and Tools**:
- Active social accounts (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Product Hunt, etc.)
- Email list (exists? size? tool used?)
- Blog (exists? platform? publishing frequency?)
- Paid advertising (any? which platforms?)
- Analytics tools (GA4, Mixpanel, etc.)
- Community presence (Discord, Slack, forums?)

**Brand and Voice**:
- Brand personality (3-5 adjectives)
- Tone examples (link to existing content that represents your voice)
- Topics to avoid
- Compliance requirements (regulated industry? legal review needed?)

**Resources**:
- Who creates content? (founder only / small team / agency)
- Available time per week for marketing activities
- Design resources (can create visuals? tools available?)
</questionnaire>

Record all answers. Ask clarifying questions if answers are vague.

### 3. Define Strategy

**Apply `Agent(marketing-strategist)`.**

Based on project context + user answers, produce:

1. **ICP and Positioning** — ideal customer profile, JTBD, competitive positioning (April Dunford framework)
2. **Messaging Framework** — core value proposition, 3-5 pillars, proof points, boilerplates (short/medium/long)
3. **Channel Strategy** — which channels to focus on, why, expected effort vs impact
4. **Content Pillars** — 3-5 topic areas aligned with ICP pain points and product strengths
5. **Tactical Plan** — specific recurring tasks with frequency, matched to available resources

### 4. Create MARKETING.md

Create `marketing/MARKETING.md` using the template from `marketing-operations` skill (`marketing-setup-template.md`).

This file is the **single source of truth** for marketing strategy. Sections:

- Product summary and positioning
- ICP and personas
- Messaging framework (value prop, pillars, boilerplates)
- Channel strategy with prioritization
- Content pillars and calendar
- Tactical plan (daily/weekly/monthly tasks)
- KPIs and measurement plan
- Brand voice guidelines
- Tools and accounts

### 5. Create Content Calendar

Create `marketing/content-calendar.md` with the recurring task schedule. Recommended defaults (adjust based on user resources):

| Frequency | Task | Channel | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Daily | Social media post | X/Twitter, LinkedIn | `Agent(content-designer)` |
| Daily | Community engagement | X/Twitter, Reddit, forums | `Agent(marketing-strategist)` |
| 2-3x/week | Blog post | Blog | `/blog-post` |
| Weekly | Trend research | X/Twitter, HN, Reddit, Google Trends | `Agent(marketing-strategist)` |
| Weekly | Analytics review | GA4, social analytics | `Agent(marketing-strategist)` |
| Bi-weekly | Email newsletter | Email list | `Agent(content-writer)` |
| Monthly | Strategy review and adjustment | — | `Agent(marketing-strategist)` + `Agent(product-manager)` |

### 6. Present and Approve

Present the complete strategy to the user:

- MARKETING.md summary
- Content calendar
- Recommended first 3 actions to start immediately

**Wait for user approval.** Adjust based on feedback.

---

## Phase 2: Execute

### 1. Select Operation

Ask the user which marketing operation to perform:

| Operation | Description | Typical Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **social-post** | Draft social media post(s) for one or more platforms | Daily |
| **blog-post** | Write a blog post (delegates to `/blog-post`) | 2-3x/week |
| **email** | Draft email campaign or newsletter | Bi-weekly |
| **trend-research** | Research trends and content opportunities | Weekly |
| **analytics** | Review marketing metrics and adjust tactics | Weekly |
| **content-repurpose** | Adapt existing content for other channels | As needed |
| **community** | Plan community engagement responses | Daily |
| **strategy-review** | Monthly strategy review and adjustment | Monthly |

### 2. Load Context

1. **Read `marketing/MARKETING.md`** — strategy, ICP, messaging, voice
2. **Read `marketing/content-calendar.md`** — planned tasks, completed items
3. **Scan recent materials** in `marketing/` — maintain consistency

### 3. Execute Operation

#### social-post

**Apply `Agent(content-designer)` + `Agent(marketing-strategist)`.**

   - **Reddit**: Community tone, value-first, no self-promotion, context-aware
