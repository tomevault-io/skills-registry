description: Detect the repository's likely stack/framework (heuristics) and generate an adapted code-structure review (large files, folder hygiene, suggested module/component boundaries) as a Markdown report. Use when Codex needs to check whether code is overly concentrated in single files and propose clearer structure, even when the stack is not yet known. Use when this capability is needed.

# Code structure review (stack-aware)

## Run

Print a Markdown report to stdout:

```bash
python logics/skills/logics-code-structure-reviewer/scripts/code_structure_review.py
```

Write the report to a file:

```bash
python logics/skills/logics-code-structure-reviewer/scripts/code_structure_review.py --out logics/CODE_REVIEW.md
```

## Useful flags

- `--max-lines 400`: Threshold for "large file" detection.
- `--top 20`: Number of largest files to list.
- `--include-logics`: Include `logics/**` in the scan (off by default).
