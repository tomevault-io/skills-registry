description: Lint and validate the Logics Markdown conventions. Use when Codex should verify filenames, top headings, and required indicators across `logics/request`, `logics/backlog`, `logics/tasks`, `logics/product`, and `logics/architecture`, and report inconsistencies. Use when this capability is needed.

# Lint Logics docs

## Run

```bash
python logics/skills/logics-doc-linter/scripts/logics_lint.py
python logics/skills/logics-doc-linter/scripts/logics_lint.py --require-status
```

## What it checks

- Filename patterns (`req_###_*.md`, `item_###_*.md`, `task_###_*.md`, `prod_###_*.md`, `adr_###_*.md`).
- First heading format: `## <doc_ref> - <Title>`.
- Required indicators:
  - requests: `From version`, `Understanding`, `Confidence`
  - backlog/tasks: plus `Progress`
- product briefs: `Date`, `Status`, related refs, `Reminder`
- architecture docs: `Date`, `Status`, `Drivers`, related refs, `Reminder`
- `Status` value validation when present using the allowed values for each doc family.
- Optional strict mode (`--require-status`) to enforce `Status` on every supported doc type.
- For modified or untracked workflow docs (`request`, `backlog`, `task`):
  - blocking errors for critical indicator placeholders such as `X.X.X` and `??%`
  - warning-level reporting for leftover template filler text such as `Describe the need` or `Add context and constraints`
  - warning-level reporting for generic Mermaid scaffolds or missing/stale `%% logics-signature` comments in workflow Mermaid blocks
  - if a doc edit is explicitly non-semantic, add a marker such as `> Maintenance edit:` or `> Non-semantic edit:` in the doc so the linter can keep indicators stable without guessing intent
