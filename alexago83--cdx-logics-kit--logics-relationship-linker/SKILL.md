# Relationships

## Generate a relationship report

```bash
python logics/skills/logics-relationship-linker/scripts/link_relations.py --out logics/RELATIONSHIPS.md
```

## Conventions

- Prefer referencing docs using their doc ref (e.g. `req_001_some_slug`, `item_002_some_slug`, `task_003_some_slug`, `spec_004_some_slug`, `prod_005_some_slug`, `adr_006_some_slug`).
- Keep relationships lightweight (don’t try to model everything).
