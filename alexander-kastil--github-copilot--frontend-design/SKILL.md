# Frontend Design

Guide for creating distinctive, accessibility-compliant frontend interfaces that avoid generic aesthetics while meeting production-grade standards.

Use this skill when:

- Building new components, pages, or full applications
- Designing visual interfaces with clear aesthetic vision
- Implementing design systems with accessible components
- Styling for multiple themes or branding needs
- Creating responsive layouts for modern web standards

## Design Thinking

Before coding, establish clear context and aesthetic direction:

Define purpose: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it? What's the user goal?

Choose aesthetic tone intentionally. Pick a strong direction:

- Minimalist and refined
- Brutally bold and maximalist
- Retro-futuristic
- Organic and natural
- Luxury and elevated
- Playful and whimsical
- Editorial and magazine-style
- Brutalist and raw
- Art deco and geometric
- Soft and pastel
- Industrial and utilitarian

Document constraints: Framework requirements, performance budgets, accessibility standards (WCAG 2.2 Level AA minimum), browser support, device targets.

Identify differentiation: What makes this memorable? What's the one thing users will remember about this design?

Execute with intention and precision. Bold, cohesive designs are more effective than timid, scattered choices.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography

Choose fonts that elevate and distinguish the interface:

- Use distinctive display fonts for headings, not generic choices like Arial, Roboto, or Inter
- Pair a bold, characterful display font with a refined, readable body font
- Ensure font choices align with your aesthetic direction
- Verify sufficient contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum for body text, 3:1 for large text per WCAG 2.2)

### Color and Theme

Establish a cohesive color system:

- Define CSS variables for all colors to ensure consistency
- Use a dominant color with sharp accent colors; avoid timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Create separate color systems for light and dark themes
- Test all interactive states (default, hover, active, focus, visited) for sufficient contrast
- In forced-colors mode, use system color keywords (ButtonText, ButtonBorder, CanvasText, etc.)

### Motion and Animation

Use animation purposefully:

- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for standard HTML/CSS interfaces
- In React, leverage animation libraries for sophisticated interactions
- Focus on high-impact moments: a well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions
- Add hover states and scroll-triggering animations that surprise without disorienting
- Ensure animations don't cause motion sickness (avoid flashing, rapid transitions)

### Spatial Composition

Create compelling layouts:

- Use unexpected layouts with asymmetry, overlap, and diagonal flow
- Break grid patterns with intentional off-axis elements
- Balance generous negative space with controlled density
- Implement responsive stacking that maintains visual hierarchy at all breakpoints
- At narrow widths (320px viewport), ensure two-directional scrolling is not required for any text or controls

### Backgrounds and Visual Details

Add depth and atmosphere:

- Move beyond solid colors with contextual visual effects and textures
- Use gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, or grain overlays
- Match all decorative elements to your established aesthetic direction
- In forced-colors mode, use borders instead of box-shadows (which are suppressed)

### Accessibility Requirements

Integrate accessibility from the start, not as an afterthought:

- Use semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, footer, section, article)
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard operable with visible focus indicators
- Maintain logical tab order following reading order
- Provide visible labels for all form controls
- Use ARIA only when native HTML semantics don't work
- Ensure color is never the only cue for information (error, success, required state)
- Test at minimum 320px viewport width with no horizontal scrolling for normal text
- Support high contrast and forced colors mode with media queries

## Implementation Patterns

### HTML/CSS Approach

Build semantic, accessible markup:

- Use native elements: button, input, select, textarea, a (links), nav, main
- Add appropriate ARIA only when necessary
- Define CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, typography
- Test in multiple browsers and on real devices

### React/Vue/Angular Approach

Leverage component libraries when available:

- Use project-approved UI libraries to ensure consistency and accessibility
- Create reusable, self-contained components with clear props
- Handle focus management in interactive patterns (modals, menus, tabs)
- Test keyboard navigation and assistive technology

## Avoiding Generic AI Aesthetics

Never rely on overused, cookie-cutter patterns:

- Skip generic font families like Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts
- Avoid cliched color schemes (especially purple gradients on white)
- Break away from predictable layouts and standard component patterns
- Make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for context

Each design should have distinct character. Vary between projects: alternate light and dark, switch fonts and palettes, choose different aesthetic directions. Show what can be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

## Final Verification

Before delivery, verify:

- Clear aesthetic direction executed with precision
- Strong typography pairings with appropriate contrast
- Cohesive color system with CSS variables
- Responsive layout that works at 320px viewport
- All interactive elements keyboard operable with visible focus
- Color never the only cue for state or meaning
- Forced-colors mode compatibility
- Semantic HTML with appropriate ARIA when needed
- Production-grade code quality and performance
