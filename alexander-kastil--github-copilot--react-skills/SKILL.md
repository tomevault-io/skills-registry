# React Component Development

Create production-quality React components following Microsoft best practices, accessibility standards, and industry patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

Generate React components when you need to:

- Build new UI components from scratch
- Convert design mockups or prototypes to React code
- Create reusable UI patterns for projects
- Optimize existing components for performance
- Implement accessibility features (WCAG 2.2 compliance)
- Structure project layout with hooks, data layers, and component separation
- Set up TypeScript interfaces and prop validation
- Create template scaffolds for consistent component development

## Prerequisites

Ensure your project has:

- Node.js and npm installed
- React 18+ (16.13+ minimum)
- TypeScript configured with strict mode enabled
- Either Fluent UI or preferred component library already installed
- ESLint configured for React and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS configured (optional but recommended for styling)

## Architectural Rules

Follow these guidelines for clean, maintainable components:

### Component Structure

- Break designs into independent, single-responsibility components
- Avoid large monolithic files; aim for focused, testable components
- Place each component in its own file under src/components/

### Type Safety

- Every component must export a Readonly TypeScript interface for props named ComponentNameProps
- Use strict null checking and non-null assertions sparingly
- Define component return type explicitly as React.ReactElement or JSX.Element

### Logic and Data Separation

- Move event handlers and business logic into custom hooks in src/hooks/
- Create hooks for state management, side effects, and reusable logic
- Place all static text, image URLs, lists, and mock data in src/data/mockData.ts
- Keep components pure; avoid modifying props or external state

### Styling Approach

- Use Fluent UI components for consistent, accessible styling when available
- Map project design tokens to Tailwind CSS classes for custom styling
- Extract color values and spacing from a design system file
- Use theme-mapped Tailwind classes instead of arbitrary hex values
- For Fluent UI imports, use path-based imports to reduce bundle size:
  import { Button } from '@fluentui/react/lib/Button' instead of import { Button } from '@fluentui/react'

### Performance Optimization

- Use React.memo for function components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Memoize callbacks with useCallback when passed to child components
- Optimize expensive computations with useMemo
- Only call ReactDOM.render when bound properties or framework aspects change
- Use PureComponent for class components or React.memo for function components

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 Level AA)

- Provide keyboard navigation alternatives to mouse/touch events
- Set proper ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Implement visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Avoid keyboard traps; ensure logical tab order
- Use semantic HTML elements and Fluent UI accessible components
- Provide alt text for images, hide decorative images with aria-hidden
- Test with keyboard-only navigation and screen readers

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. Environment Setup
   - Verify node_modules exists; run npm install if needed
   - Check TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json) targets es2015 or higher
   - Confirm Fluent UI and styling libraries are installed

2. Create Data Layer
   - Build src/data/mockData.ts with static content referenced by the component
   - Export constants, arrays, and configuration as named exports
   - Use meaningful names; avoid magic strings

3. Define Component Interface
   - Create a Readonly TypeScript interface named ComponentNameProps
   - Define all props with explicit types (avoid any)
   - Mark optional props with ? and provide JSDoc comments
   - Include event handler prop types (e.g., onClick: () => void)

4. Build Component
   - Start with a functional component using const syntax
   - Accept props destructured and typed with ComponentNameProps
   - Use Fluent UI components from path-based imports for UI elements
   - Implement any hooks (useState, useCallback, useMemo) needed for interactivity
   - Return JSX with semantic HTML and accessible patterns
   - Export component as default export

5. Implement Custom Hooks (if needed)
   - Create src/hooks/useComponentLogic.ts for reusable state and effects
   - Use custom hooks for form handling, API calls, or complex state
   - Keep hooks pure and testable

6. Wire Into Application
   - Import component into App.tsx or parent container
   - Pass required props from parent state or context
   - Map component to route or layout section

7. Quality Checks
   - Run npm run lint to check for TypeScript and ESLint issues
   - Verify component with npm run dev in local dev environment
   - Test keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, focus management
   - Check contrast ratios and visual appearance
   - Validate accessibility with browser dev tools or Accessibility Insights
   - Test performance with React DevTools Profiler

8. Validate Against Checklist
   - Component exported as default with clear file naming
   - Props interface defined and properly typed
   - All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Accessibility attributes (aria-\*, role, alt) are present where needed
   - Styling uses design tokens; no hardcoded hex values in component code
   - Logic separated into custom hooks
   - Static data moved to mockData.ts
   - No console errors, warnings, or linting issues

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Solution                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript errors with props | Ensure ComponentNameProps interface is defined and props parameter is typed with it          |
| Component not rendering      | Verify component is exported as default or named export; check parent imports and props      |
| Styling not applied          | Confirm Fluent UI or Tailwind CSS packages are installed; check class names match config     |
| Accessibility issues         | Run browser accessibility inspector; verify ARIA attributes, focus, and color contrast       |
| Bundle size too large        | Use path-based imports from Fluent UI; enable tree-shaking in tsconfig.json                  |
| Unnecessary re-renders       | Add React.memo to component or use useCallback for event handlers                            |
| Focus not visible            | Check CSS includes clear :focus styles; apply outline or border-based focus indicator        |
| Screen reader not announcing | Test ARIA labels, roles, and semantic HTML; use aria-label on unlabeled interactive elements |
