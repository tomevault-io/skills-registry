# React State Management

Master modern state management patterns for React applications, from local component state to global stores, server state synchronization, and complex data flows.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Set up global state management in a React application
- Choose between Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai, or React Query
- Manage server state with caching and synchronization
- Implement optimistic updates and rollback patterns
- Manage form state with validation and complex interactions
- Debug state-related mutations and performance issues
- Migrate from legacy Redux patterns to modern approaches
- Combine multiple state management solutions
- Create typed, scalable state architecture with TypeScript

## Prerequisites

Project requirements:

- React 16.8+ (hooks support required)
- TypeScript configured with strict mode
- Node.js 14+ with npm/yarn
- Selected state management library (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai, or React Query)
- Understanding of React hooks (useState, useReducer, useContext)

## Core Concepts

### State Categories

| Category     | Purpose                      | Solutions                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Local State  | Component-specific, UI state | useState, useReducer             |
| Global State | Shared across components     | Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai    |
| Server State | Remote data, caching, sync   | React Query, SWR, RTK Query      |
| URL State    | Route parameters, search     | React Router, nuqs               |
| Form State   | Input values, validation     | React Hook Form, Formik, Zustand |

### Selection Criteria

Choose based on application complexity and data needs:

- Small app, simple state: Zustand or Jotai
- Large app, complex state: Redux Toolkit with slices
- Heavy server interaction: React Query + light client state
- Atomic/granular updates: Jotai with atom-based architecture
- Form-heavy application: React Hook Form + local Zustand state
- Mixed requirements: Zustand for client + React Query for server

## Architectural Patterns

### Pattern 1: Redux Toolkit with TypeScript

Use Redux Toolkit for large, complex applications with:

- Complex state interactions
- Time-travel debugging needs
- DevTools middleware integration
- Async thunks for API calls

Structure:

- store/index.ts: Configure store with slices
- store/slices/featureSlice.ts: Feature-specific reducers and actions
- Hooks at store/hooks.ts: Typed useAppDispatch and useAppSelector

Key practices:

- Define PayloadAction types explicitly
- Use createAsyncThunk for API calls
- Implement proper error states (idle, loading, succeeded, failed)
- Type all state slices with TypeScript interfaces

### Pattern 2: Zustand for Scalable State

Use Zustand for medium to large apps requiring:

- Simple, unopinionated store setup
- Slice-based organization
- API integration without middleware
- Optimized re-renders with selective subscriptions

Structure:

- store/slices/userSlice.ts: User state and actions
- store/slices/cartSlice.ts: Cart state and actions
- store/index.ts: Combine slices with type-safe hooks

Key practices:

- Use StateCreator pattern for scalable slices
- Create selector hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Combine stores with shallow merging
- Middleware support (persist, devtools) for advanced features

### Pattern 3: Jotai for Atomic State

Use Jotai for applications with:

- Fine-grained reactivity requirements
- Derived and computed atoms
- Async atom support with Suspense
- Dynamic atom creation

Structure:

- atoms/userAtoms.ts: Individual atoms and derived atoms
- atoms/cartAtoms.ts: Cart-related atoms
- Components use useAtom hook for read/write operations

Key practices:

- Keep atoms small and focused
- Use derived atoms for computed values (dont store derived data)
- Leverage atomWithStorage for persistence
- Use write-only atoms for actions
- Enable Suspense for async atoms

### Pattern 4: React Query for Server State

Use React Query (TanStack Query) to:

- Fetch and cache remote data
- Handle success/error states
- Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern
- Synchronize server state with UI

Structure:

- hooks/useUsers.ts: Query and mutation definitions
- hooks/queryKeys.ts: Query key factory for consistency
- Components use hooks with automatic lifecycle management

Key practices:

- Define queryKey factory for consistent query identification
- Set staleTime and gcTime appropriately (previously cacheTime)
- Use enabled option for conditional queries
- Implement optimistic updates with onMutate/onError/onSettled
- Keep query client accessible for invalidation

### Pattern 5: Combining Client and Server State

For real-world applications, combine approaches:

- Zustand (or Jotai) for UI client state (sidebar, modals, filters)
- React Query for server state (users, posts, data)
- React Hook Form for form state validation

Benefits:

- Separation of concerns
- Optimized re-renders per state type
- Clear data flow and debugging
- Reusable query logic

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Define State Structure

Start by identifying state categories:

- What is local/component UI state?
- What is shared global state?
- What comes from a server/API?
- What URL patterns need to be reflected?

### 2. Choose State Management Solution

Decision tree:

- Is it server data? → React Query
- Does it affect many components? → Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- Does it require complex reactions? → Jotai
- Is it form input? → React Hook Form + light client state

### 3. Setup Store/Atoms

For Redux Toolkit:

- Create store/index.ts with configureStore
- Create slices in store/slices/
- Export typed hooks at store/hooks.ts

For Zustand:

- Create store/slices/feature.ts with StateCreator
- Combine in store/index.ts
- Export selector hooks for optimization

For Jotai:

- Create atoms/index.ts with atom definitions
- Create derived atoms for computed values
- Export atoms for use in components

For React Query:

- Create hooks/useFeature.ts with useQuery/useMutation
- Define queryKey factory
- Implement error handling and optimistic updates

### 4. Integrate Into Components

- Import typed hooks (Redux, Zustand) or atoms (Jotai)
- Use in functional components with proper TypeScript types
- Memoize selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Handle loading and error states

### 5. Test State Logic

- Test reducers/slices in isolation (Redux)
- Test mutations and query behavior (React Query)
- Test atom subscriptions (Jotai)
- Verify DevTools integration for debugging

### 6. Optimize Performance

- Use selectors to subscribe to specific parts of state
- Memoize components with React.memo if needed
- Implement proper staleTime and gcTime (React Query)
- Avoid storing derived data

## Best Practices

### Do

- Colocate state close to where its used
- Use selectors and custom hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Normalize server data to avoid duplication
- Type everything with TypeScript for safety
- Separate server state (React Query) from client state (Zustand)
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Use DevTools for debugging and time-travel

### Don't

- Over-globalize state; not everything needs global store
- Duplicate server state with local state; let React Query manage it
- Mutate state directly; always use immutable updates (Redux/Zustand handle this)
- Store derived/computed data; compute it instead
- Mix multiple state solutions for the same category of state
- Ignore TypeScript types; embrace strict mode
- Ignore stale state; set appropriate staleTime values

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                   | Solution                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unnecessary re-renders  | Use selectors (Redux), custom hooks (Zustand), or atom subscriptions (Jotai); avoid parent state changes |
| State not updating      | Verify action/reducer/setter was dispatched; check DevTools for state changes                            |
| Stale data displayed    | Increase staleTime in React Query; manually invalidate queries when needed                               |
| Cannot serialize state  | Redux Toolkit has serializableCheck; use middleware options to ignore certain actions                    |
| Memory leaks with async | Unsubscribe from query changes; Zustand and React Query handle cleanup automatically                     |
| TypeScript type errors  | Export RootState and AppDispatch types from store; use StateCreator generics for Zustand                 |
| DevTools not showing    | Enable devtools middleware; Redux, Zustand, and Jotai all include DevTools support                       |
| Query keys not matching | Use queryKey factory pattern; ensure consistent key structure across mutations and queries               |

## Migration Guide: Legacy Redux to Redux Toolkit

From old-style Redux action creators and reducers:

```typescript
// Before
const ADD_TODO = "ADD_TODO"
const addTodo = (text) => ({ type: ADD_TODO, payload: text })
function todosReducer(state = [], action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case ADD_TODO:
      return [...state, { text: action.payload, completed: false }]
    default:
      return state
  }
}

// After - Redux Toolkit
const todosSlice = createSlice({
  name: "todos",
  initialState: [] as Todo[],
  reducers: {
    addTodo: (state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
      state.push({ text: action.payload, completed: false })
    }
  }
})
export const { addTodo } = todosSlice.actions
```

Key improvements:

- Less boilerplate (no action creators needed)
- Immer integration allows "mutation-like" syntax
- Better TypeScript support
- Built-in DevTools
- Slice-based organization
