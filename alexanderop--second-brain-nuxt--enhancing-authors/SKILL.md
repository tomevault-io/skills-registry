# Enhancing Author Profiles

This skill fills in missing author profile fields (bio, avatar, website, socials) via web research.

## Workflow Overview

```text
Phase 1: Author Identification
   └─ Find and validate author file

Phase 2: Parallel Research (for missing fields only)
   ├─ WebSearch agent 1: bio/background
   ├─ WebSearch agent 2: avatar URL
   └─ WebSearch agent 3: website + socials

Phase 3: User Review (BLOCKING GATE)
   └─ Present findings, await approval

Phase 4: Save Enhanced Author
   └─ Update frontmatter fields

Phase 5: Quality Check
   └─ Run vp check && pnpm typecheck
```

## Phase 1: Author Identification

### 1.1 Find the Author File

Accept an author slug, name, or partial name as argument:

1. **Try exact slug match first**: Check if `content/authors/{slug}.md` exists (convert spaces to hyphens, lowercase)
2. **If no exact match**: Use Grep to search for the name in author files:
   ```text
   Grep pattern: "name:.*{search term}" with glob: "content/authors/*.md"
   ```

**Outcomes:**

- Single match → proceed with that file
- Multiple matches → list options for user to choose
- No match → list available authors

### 1.2 Identify Missing Fields

Read the author file and check which fields are missing or empty:

**Required fields (always present):**

- `name`
- `slug`

**Optional fields to enhance:**

- `bio` - Professional background and expertise
- `avatar` - URL to profile picture
- `website` - Personal website URL
- `socials.twitter` - Twitter/X handle
- `socials.github` - GitHub username
- `socials.linkedin` - LinkedIn username
- `socials.youtube` - YouTube channel

A field is "missing" if:

- It doesn't exist in the frontmatter
- It exists but is empty (`""` or `null`)

If all fields are already populated, inform the user and offer to update specific fields.

---

## Phase 2: Parallel Research

Spawn **up to 3 WebSearch agents in parallel** based on what fields are missing:

```markdown
**Agent 1 - Bio/Background:**
Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
prompt: "Use WebSearch to find professional background info for [Author Name].
Query: '[Author Name]' bio background expertise
Extract: Job title, company, areas of expertise, notable projects.
Return: A 1-2 sentence professional bio."

**Agent 2 - Avatar URL:**
Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
prompt: "Use WebSearch to find a profile picture URL for [Author Name].
Query: '[Author Name]' site:github.com OR site:twitter.com
Extract: GitHub username or Twitter handle to construct avatar URL.
Return: Avatar URL (prefer GitHub format: https://github.com/{username}.png)"

**Agent 3 - Website & Socials:**
Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
prompt: "Use WebSearch to find social media profiles for [Author Name].
Query: '[Author Name]' twitter github linkedin youtube
Extract: Personal website, Twitter handle, GitHub username, LinkedIn profile, YouTube channel.
Return: List of found profiles with URLs/handles."
```

Only spawn agents for missing fields. If bio already exists, skip Agent 1.

Collect all results via `TaskOutput` (blocking).

## Phase 3: User Review (BLOCKING GATE)

**This is a mandatory approval step.** Present the proposed changes before saving.

### 3.1 Present Changes

Display proposed updates as a comparison table:

```markdown
## Proposed Updates for [Author Name]

| Field            | Current | Proposed                          |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| bio              | (empty) | "Founder of X, creator of Y..."   |
| avatar           | (empty) | "https://github.com/username.png" |
| website          | (empty) | "https://example.com"             |
| socials.twitter  | (empty) | "username"                        |
| socials.github   | (empty) | "username"                        |
| socials.linkedin | (empty) | "username"                        |
| socials.youtube  | (empty) | (not found)                       |
```

### 3.2 Request Approval

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

```yaml
question: "Save these changes to the author profile?"
header: "Review"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Save"
    description: "Update the author file with these values"
  - label: "Edit"
    description: "Tell me what to change"
  - label: "Cancel"
    description: "Don't modify the file"
```

### 3.3 Handle Response

- **Save**: Proceed to Phase 4
- **Edit**: Apply user feedback, show updated preview
- **Cancel**: Exit without changes

**Do NOT proceed to Phase 4 without explicit user approval.**

---

## Phase 4: Save Enhanced Author

### 4.1 Update Frontmatter

Use the Edit tool to update only the approved fields:

**Before:**

```yaml
---
name: "John Doe"
slug: "john-doe"
bio: ""
avatar: ""
website: ""
socials:
  twitter: ""
  github: ""
  linkedin: ""
  youtube: ""
---
```

**After:**

```yaml
---
name: "John Doe"
slug: "john-doe"
bio: "Software engineer specializing in distributed systems..."
avatar: "https://github.com/johndoe.png"
website: "https://johndoe.dev"
socials:
  twitter: "johndoe"
  github: "johndoe"
  linkedin: "johndoe"
  youtube: ""
---
```

### 4.2 Preserve Existing Values

**Critical:** Never overwrite existing non-empty values unless explicitly requested:

- Keep existing `name` and `slug` unchanged
- Only update fields that were empty/missing
- Preserve any additional custom fields

### 4.3 Confirmation

Report to user:

```markdown
Updated: content/authors/{slug}.md

- bio: added
- avatar: added
- website: added
- socials.twitter: added
- socials.github: added
```

---

## Phase 5: Quality Check

Run linter and type check to catch any issues:

```bash
vp check && pnpm typecheck
```

If errors are found, fix them before completing the task.

## Error Recovery

| Error                | Recovery                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Author not found     | List available authors in `content/authors/`     |
| No missing fields    | Inform user, offer to update specific fields     |
| WebSearch fails      | Try alternative query patterns                   |
| User rejects changes | Allow editing or cancel                          |
| Could not find info  | Mark field as "(not found)", proceed with others |
