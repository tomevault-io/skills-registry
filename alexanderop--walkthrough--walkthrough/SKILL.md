# Codebase Walkthrough Generator

Generate interactive HTML files with clickable Mermaid diagrams that give new developers a **quick mental model** of how a feature or system works. The goal is fast onboarding — a rough map of concepts and connections, not a code reference. Each walkthrough should be readable in under 2 minutes.

**CRITICAL**: When this skill is triggered, you MUST generate a `walkthrough-*.html` file. Never respond with just text — always produce the interactive HTML output.

**Always dark mode.** Every walkthrough uses a pure black background (`#000000`), white text, and purple accents. Never generate light-mode walkthroughs. The `<html>` tag MUST include `style="color-scheme: dark"`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the scope

Clarify what the user wants explained:
- A specific feature flow (e.g., "how does canvas drawing work")
- A data flow (e.g., "how does state flow from composable to component")
- An architectural overview (e.g., "how are features organized")
- A request lifecycle (e.g., "what happens when a user clicks draw")
- A database schema (e.g., "explain the tables and relationships")
- A data model (e.g., "how is user data structured")

If the prompt is `$walkthrough` with no topic, generate an **overview walkthrough of the entire project** — show the main modules, how they connect, and the overall architecture.

Frame the walkthrough as a **mental model for someone new**. Think: "What are the 5-12 key concepts, and how do they connect?"

If the request is vague (and not a bare `$walkthrough`), ask one clarifying question. Otherwise proceed.

### Step 2: Explore the codebase with parallel subagents

**Always read real source files before generating.** Never fabricate code paths.

**Use the Task tool to delegate exploration to subagents.** This keeps the main context clean for HTML generation and parallelizes the research phase.

#### 2a. Identify areas to explore

Do a quick Glob/Grep yourself (1-2 calls max) to identify the relevant directories and file groups. Then split the exploration into 2-4 independent research tasks.

#### 2b. Launch parallel Explore subagents

Use `Task` with `subagent_type: "Explore"` to launch multiple agents **in a single message** (parallel). Each agent should investigate one area and report back the **purpose and connections** of each piece — not code dumps.

**Give each subagent a focused prompt that asks it to return a structured report with:**
- What the piece does (purpose) and why it exists (role in the system)
- How it connects to other pieces (imports, calls, data flow)
- A suggested node ID (camelCase) and plain-English label (e.g., "Drawing Interaction", not "useDrawingInteraction()")
- The primary file path(s)
- **A code snippet** (required, 1-5 lines)

**Tell each subagent to format its report as a list of nodes like this:**

```
NODE: drawingInteraction
  label: Drawing Interaction
  file: app/features/tools/useDrawingInteraction.ts
  purpose: Converts pointer events into shape data. This is the bridge between raw mouse input and the element model.
  connects_to: canvasRenderer (feeds shape data), toolState (reads active tool)
  key_snippet:
    const element = createElement(tool, startPoint, currentPoint)
    lang: typescript
```

**Every node MUST include a code snippet.** Pick the single most useful piece — a key function call, type definition, config line, or core algorithm (1-5 lines). This gives developers a concrete anchor alongside the conceptual description.

**Example: splitting a "drawing tool" walkthrough into subagents:**

```
Subagent 1: "Explore user input handling"
→ Read tool selection, pointer event handling
→ Report: purpose of each piece, how they connect

Subagent 2: "Explore rendering pipeline"
→ Read canvas rendering, scene management
→ Report: what renders elements, how it gets triggered

Subagent 3: "Explore element model and state"
→ Read element types, state management
→ Report: how elements are stored, what shape they have
```

**Do NOT read the files yourself** — let the subagents do it. Your job is to orchestrate and then synthesize their results into the HTML.

#### 2c. Synthesize subagent results (no more file reads)

Once all subagents return, you have everything needed. **Do NOT read any more files or launch more subagents.** Go directly to Steps 3-4.

Combine subagent findings into:
1. **Node list** — ID, plain-English label, primary file(s), 1-2 sentence description, code snippet + lang
2. **Edge list** — which nodes connect, with plain verb labels ("triggers", "feeds into", "produces")
3. **Subgraph groupings** — 2-4 groups with approachable labels ("User Input", "Processing", "Output")

**Keep to 5-12 nodes total (minimum 5 is strict — never generate fewer).** Each node represents a *concept*, not a function. Group related functions into a single node. If you have more than 12 nodes, merge related ones. If subagent results give you fewer than 5, expand related concepts or split a broad node into finer-grained ones until you reach at least 5.

If a subagent's report is missing info for a node, drop that node rather than reading files yourself — but ensure you still meet the 5-node minimum.

### Step 3: Choose the diagram type

Pick the Mermaid diagram type based on the topic:

| Topic | Diagram Type | Mermaid Syntax |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Feature flows, request lifecycles, architecture | **Flowchart** | `graph TD` / `graph LR` |
| Database schemas, table relationships, data models | **ER Diagram** | `erDiagram` |
| Mixed (API flow + DB schema) | **Both** — render two diagrams side by side or stacked | Flowchart + ER |

**Diagram sizing**: Keep to **5-12 nodes** grouped into **2-4 subgraphs**. This keeps the diagram scannable at a glance.

#### Flowchart (`graph TD` / `graph LR`)

**Direction**: Use `graph TD` (top-down) for hierarchical flows, `graph LR` (left-right) for sequential pipelines.

**Node types** (styled by category):
| Type | Style | Use for |
|------|-------|---------|
| `component` | Purple-500 | Vue components, pages |
| `composable` | Purple-600 | Composables, hooks |
| `utility` | Purple-700 | Utils, helpers, pure functions |
| `external` | Gray-600 | Libraries, browser APIs, external services |
| `event` | Purple-200 | Events, user actions, triggers |
| `data` | Purple-600 | Stores, state, data structures |

**Subgraphs**: Group related nodes into 2-4 subgraphs with approachable mental-model labels (e.g., "User Input", "Core Logic", "Visual Output") — not technical layer names.

**Node IDs**: Use descriptive camelCase IDs that map to the detail data (e.g., `drawingInteraction`, `canvasRenderer`).

**Node labels in Mermaid**: Use plain-English labels — "Drawing Interaction", "Canvas Rendering" — not function names or file names.

**Edges**: Label with plain verbs — "triggers", "feeds into", "reads", "produces", "watches". Not API method names.

#### ER Diagram (`erDiagram`)

Use for database-related walkthroughs: schema design, table relationships, migrations, data models.

**Syntax**:
```
erDiagram
    USERS {
        string id PK
        string email UK
        string name
        timestamp created_at
    }
    TEAMS {
        string id PK
        string name
        string owner_id FK
    }
    TEAM_MEMBERS {
        string team_id FK
        string user_id FK
        string role
    }
    USERS ||--o{ TEAM_MEMBERS : "joins"
    TEAMS ||--o{ TEAM_MEMBERS : "has"
    USERS ||--o{ TEAMS : "owns"
```

**Relationship cardinality**:
| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `\|\|--o{` | One to many |
| `\|\|--\|\|` | One to one |
| `}o--o{` | Many to many |
| `\|\|--o\|` | One to zero-or-one |

**Column markers**: `PK` (primary key), `FK` (foreign key), `UK` (unique).

**Click handlers on ER diagrams**: Entities in ER diagrams don't natively support Mermaid `click` callbacks. Instead, add click listeners manually after render via `querySelectorAll('.entityLabel')` — see html-patterns.md for the pattern.

### Step 4: Generate the HTML file

Create a single self-contained HTML file following the patterns in [references/html-patterns.md](references/html-patterns.md).

**File location**: Write to the project root as `walkthrough-{topic}.html` (e.g., `walkthrough-canvas-drawing.html`). Use kebab-case for the topic slug.

**Architecture**: The HTML uses `<script type="module">` (native ES modules) — **not** Babel. This means:
- Template literals (backticks) work fine — use them freely for multi-line strings
- Shiki is imported via ESM and highlights code at startup
- React/ReactDOM are loaded as UMD globals, accessed as `window.React` / `window.ReactDOM`
- No JSX — use `React.createElement()` for all component rendering

**Required elements**:
1. Title and subtitle describing the walkthrough scope
2. **TL;DR summary** — 2-3 sentences rendered above the diagram as a visible card. A new dev reads this first, then explores.
3. Mermaid flowchart with clickable nodes (5-12 nodes)
4. Node detail panel showing: 1-2 sentence description, file path(s), code snippet
5. Legend showing node type color coding

**Node detail data** — for each node, include:
```js
nodeId: {
  title: "Drawing Interaction",
  description: "Converts pointer events into shape data. This is the bridge between raw mouse input and the element model.",
  files: ["app/features/tools/useDrawingInteraction.ts"],
  code: `const element = createElement(tool, startPoint, currentPoint)`,
  lang: "typescript",
}
```

Key points:
- `description` = 1-2 plain-text sentences. Answer "what is this?" and "why does it exist?" Not "how does it work internally?"
- `code` = **required** (1-5 lines). Pick the most useful piece (see snippet guidance in Step 2b above).
- `lang` = **required on EVERY node** — must be explicitly set (e.g., `"typescript"`, `"javascript"`, `"vue"`, `"json"`, `"css"`). Use `"typescript"` as the default. **Never omit the `lang` field.**
- `files` = array of `"path"` or `"path:lines"` strings.

**After writing the file**, open it in the user's browser:
```bash
open walkthrough-{topic}.html    # macOS
```

## Mermaid Conventions

### Click binding
Use Mermaid's callback syntax to make nodes interactive:
```
click nodeId nodeClickHandler "View details"
```

Where `nodeClickHandler` is a global JS function defined in the HTML.

### Subgraph naming
Use approachable mental-model labels:
```
subgraph user_input["User Input"]
subgraph core_logic["Core Logic"]
subgraph visual_output["Visual Output"]
```

### Edge labels
Use plain verbs:
```
A -->|"triggers"| B
A -.->|"watches"| C
A ==>|"produces"| D
```

Use `-->` for direct calls, `-.->` for reactive/watch relationships, `==>` for events/emissions.
