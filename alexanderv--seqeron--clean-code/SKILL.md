# Clean Code Development Guide

This skill helps you write clean, maintainable, and readable code following Robert C. Martin's (Uncle Bob) Clean Code principles.

> "Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose." — Grady Booch

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|

| [PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md) | Index of all principles |
| [Examples](examples/csharp/) | C# code examples |
| [Metrics & Tools](examples/csharp/11-metrics-and-tools.md) | Code quality measurement |
| [Decision Trees](examples/csharp/12-decision-trees.md) | Visual decision guides |

## When to Use This Skill

- Reviewing code for quality issues
- Refactoring existing code for better readability
- Improving naming conventions
- Simplifying complex functions
- Reducing code duplication
- Eliminating code smells
- Writing self-documenting code
- Reducing technical debt

## Relationship with Clean Architecture

| Aspect | Clean Code | Clean Architecture |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Focus | Micro-level | Macro-level |
| Scope | Functions, classes, naming | Layers, dependencies, modules |
| Goal | Readable, maintainable code | Flexible, testable systems |

**Use both together:** Clean Architecture provides structure; Clean Code ensures each piece is well-written.

## Core Principles Overview

### 1. [Meaningful Names](principles/01-meaningful-names.md)

Names should reveal intent, avoid disinformation, and be pronounceable.

| Rule | Bad | Good |
|------|-----|------|
| Reveal intent | `int d` | `int elapsedDays` |
| Avoid abbreviations | `string custNm` | `string customerName` |
| Class names = nouns | `class Process` | `class OrderProcessor` |
| Method names = verbs | `void Order()` | `void PlaceOrder()` |
| Booleans = predicates | `bool flag` | `bool isActive` |

### 2. [Functions](principles/02-functions.md)

Functions should be small, do one thing, and have minimal parameters.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Lines | 5-20 (max 30) |
| Parameters | 0-2 (max 3) |
| Levels of abstraction | 1 per function |
| Nesting depth | Max 2 levels |

**Key rules:**
- Do ONE thing
- No side effects
- Command-Query Separation
- Prefer exceptions to error codes

### 3. [Comments](principles/03-comments.md)

Good code is self-documenting. Comments should explain **WHY**, not **WHAT**.

**✅ Acceptable comments:**
- Legal/copyright notices
- Intent explanation
- Warning of consequences
- TODO with ticket references
- Public API documentation

**❌ Delete these:**
- Redundant comments
- Commented-out code
- Journal/changelog comments
- Closing brace comments

### 4. [Formatting](principles/04-formatting.md)

Code formatting is about communication.

| Metric | Target | Max |
|--------|--------|-----|
| File size | ~200 lines | 500 |
| Line width | 80-100 chars | 120 |

**Rules:**
- Vertical: Related code close together
- Horizontal: Consistent indentation
- Team: Agree on standards and enforce with tools

### 5. [Objects vs Data Structures](principles/05-objects-and-data-structures.md)

| Aspect | Objects | Data Structures |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Data | Hidden | Exposed |
| Behavior | Rich methods | None |
| Use case | Domain entities | DTOs |

**Law of Demeter:** Don't talk to strangers. Avoid `a.GetB().GetC().DoSomething()`.

### 6. [Error Handling](principles/06-error-handling.md)

Errors should be handled gracefully without obscuring logic.

**Key rules:**
- Use exceptions, not error codes
- Provide context in exceptions
- Don't return null → use Null Object, Option, or throw
- Don't pass null
- Wrap third-party exceptions

### 7. [Boundaries](principles/07-boundaries.md)

Manage third-party code with wrappers and adapters.

- Wrap third-party APIs in adapters
- Use interfaces you control
- Write learning tests for third-party code
- Convert to domain types at boundaries

### 8. [Unit Tests](principles/08-unit-tests.md)

Test code is just as important as production code.

**F.I.R.S.T.:**
- **F**ast
- **I**ndependent
- **R**epeatable
- **S**elf-validating
- **T**imely

**Key rules:**
- One concept per test
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Test edge cases
- Don't test private methods

### 9. [Classes](principles/09-classes.md)

Classes should be small and have single responsibility.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Responsibilities | 1 |
| Public methods | 5-10 max |
| Lines | 100-200 typical |
| Dependencies | 3-5 max |

**Key rules:**
- Single Responsibility Principle
- High cohesion
- Depend on abstractions
- Avoid "Manager", "Handler", "Processor" names

### 10. [Emergence](principles/10-emergence.md)

Kent Beck's four rules of simple design (in priority order):

1. **Runs all tests** — System must be verifiable
2. **No duplication** — DRY principle
3. **Expresses intent** — Self-documenting code
4. **Minimal elements** — No unnecessary complexity

### 11. [Concurrency](principles/11-concurrency.md)

Writing clean concurrent code requires special care.

**Key rules:**
- Separate concurrency from business logic
- Minimize shared mutable state
- Use immutable objects
- Async/await all the way
- Support cancellation
- Avoid deadlocks with consistent lock ordering

### 12. [Smells & Heuristics](principles/12-smells-and-heuristics.md)

Comprehensive catalog of code smells from Clean Code Appendix B.

Categories: Comments (C), Environment (E), Functions (F), General (G), Names (N), Tests (T)

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Is this code hard to understand?
├─ Bad naming? → Rename to reveal intent
├─ Too long? → Extract smaller pieces
├─ Too complex? → Simplify logic, reduce nesting
├─ Duplicated? → Extract to shared method
└─ Needs comments? → Refactor until self-documenting

Is this function doing too much?
├─ Multiple abstraction levels? → Extract methods
├─ Multiple responsibilities? → Split into focused functions
├─ Too many parameters? → Create parameter object
└─ Side effects? → Separate commands from queries

Is this class too large?
├─ Multiple reasons to change? → Split by responsibility (SRP)
├─ Too many dependencies? → Review architecture
└─ Hard to test? → Apply Dependency Inversion
```

## Code Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Cyclomatic Complexity | < 10/method | Roslyn Analyzers |
| Code Coverage | > 80% business logic | dotnet test |
| Maintainability Index | > 70 | SonarQube |
| Line Length | < 120 chars | EditorConfig |

## The Boy Scout Rule

> "Leave the code cleaner than you found it."

When touching code, always:
- Fix bad names
- Extract long methods
- Remove duplication
- Delete commented code
- Simplify complex expressions
