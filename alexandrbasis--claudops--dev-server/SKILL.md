# Dev Server — Start & Monitor

Start the project's dev server and watch its output for errors. The user says "start dev" and you handle detection, startup, and monitoring — they only hear from you when something breaks.

## Workflow

### 1. Detect the stack

Scan the working directory for project markers. Check in this order — first match wins:

| Marker file | Stack | Dev command | Default port |
|---|---|---|---|
| `package.json` | Node.js (see framework table) | varies | 3000 |
| `manage.py` | Django | `python manage.py runserver` | 8000 |
| `Pipfile` or `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.poetry]` | Python (check for framework) | varies | 8000 |
| `requirements.txt` with `fastapi` | FastAPI | `uvicorn main:app --reload` | 8000 |
| `requirements.txt` with `flask` | Flask | `flask run --reload` | 5000 |
| `Gemfile` with `rails` | Rails | `bin/rails server` | 3000 |
| `Gemfile` with `sinatra` | Sinatra | `ruby app.rb` | 4567 |
| `go.mod` | Go | `go run .` | 8080 |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust | `cargo run` | 8080 |
| `pom.xml` | Maven/Spring | `./mvnw spring-boot:run` | 8080 |
| `build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts` | Gradle/Spring | `./gradlew bootRun` | 8080 |
| `mix.exs` with `phoenix` | Phoenix | `mix phx.server` | 4000 |
| `composer.json` with `laravel` | Laravel | `php artisan serve` | 8000 |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Docker | `docker compose up` | varies |
| `Makefile` with `dev` target | Make | `make dev` | varies |

**Node.js framework detection** — when `package.json` exists, check dependencies:

| Dependency | Framework | Default command |
|---|---|---|
| `next` | Next.js | `next dev` |
| `vite` or `@vitejs/*` | Vite | `vite` |
| `@remix-run/dev` | Remix | `remix dev` |
| `astro` | Astro | `astro dev` |
| `@sveltejs/kit` | SvelteKit | `vite dev` |
| `nuxt` | Nuxt | `nuxt dev` |
| `@angular/cli` | Angular | `ng serve` |
| `gatsby` | Gatsby | `gatsby develop` |
| `expo` | Expo | `expo start` |
| _(none match)_ | npm scripts | `<pm> run dev` | 3000 |

**Node.js package manager** — check in order:
1. `bun.lock` or `bun.lockb` → `bunx` / `bun run`
2. `pnpm-lock.yaml` → `pnpm exec` / `pnpm run`
3. `yarn.lock` → `yarn` / `yarn run`
4. Default → `npx` / `npm run`

**Python environment** — check in order:
1. `.venv/` or `venv/` exists → `source .venv/bin/activate &&`
2. `poetry.lock` → `poetry run`
3. `Pipfile.lock` → `pipenv run`
4. Default → direct command

If nothing matches, tell the user you couldn't detect the stack and ask what command to run.

If the detection picks a stack that seems wrong for the directory (e.g. `package.json` exists but it's just dev tooling in a Python project, or both `manage.py` and `package.json` present and unclear which is primary), show the user your guess and confirm before starting. Don't silently commit to a wrong stack.

### 2. Pre-flight checks

Before starting:

1. **Port conflict** — check if the default (or user-specified) port is taken:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :<port> -t 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If occupied, identify the occupying process (`ps -p <pid>`) and present two options to the user: kill PID N, or bind to port+1. Pick a default — don't block on the question if the occupying process is clearly another dev-server instance of the same project.

2. **Dependencies installed?**
   - Node: check `node_modules/` exists
   - Python: check virtualenv exists or key packages importable
   - Ruby: check `bundle check` passes
   - Go/Rust/Java: no check needed (build tools handle it)

   If missing, ask the user if you should install first.

### 3. Start with Monitor

Use the **Monitor** tool with `persistent: true` so the server runs for the session.

The grep filter matters because a raw dev-server stdout stream is mostly routine request logs — thousands of lines of noise that would flood the conversation and hide real errors. The pattern below surfaces only startup failures, runtime exceptions, build errors, and warnings:

```bash
<dev-command> 2>&1 | grep --line-buffered -iE \
  '(error[:\[]| ERR[!_]|EADDRINUSE|EACCES|ENOENT|ECONNREFUSED|FATAL|panic|Segmentation|Module not found|Cannot find module|ModuleNotFoundError|ImportError|SyntaxError|TypeError|ReferenceError|NameError|AttributeError|KeyError|ValueError|RuntimeError|IndentationError|failed to|build failed|compile error|compilation error|WARN[:\[]|warning[:\[]|deprecated|port.*already|address already in use|unhandled|rejected|crash|killed|Traceback|Exception|FAILED|ActionView|ActiveRecord|LoadError|undefined method|NoMethodError|cannot find|not found|Permission denied|exit code [1-9]|exit status [1-9]|thread.*panic|cannot compile)'
```

Set the Monitor `description` to something specific: `"Next.js dev :3000"` or `"Django dev :8000"`.

**Port flag by stack** (when user specifies a port):
- Next.js: `-p PORT`
- Vite/Astro/SvelteKit/Nuxt/Remix/Angular: `--port PORT`
- Django: `0.0.0.0:PORT`
- Flask: `--port PORT`
- FastAPI/Uvicorn: `--port PORT`
- Rails: `-p PORT`
- Phoenix: via `PORT=PORT` env var
- Laravel: `--port PORT`
- Go/Rust: usually via env var or arg (check the code)

**Announce** once started *and* verified:
> Started **Next.js** dev server (`bun run dev`) on :3000 — root URL returned 200, no error overlay. Monitoring for errors.

### 3.5. Verify it's actually serving

"No error in the Monitor" ≠ "the app works." After the dev command announces readiness, confirm the server is reachable before handing control back to the user:

1. **HTTP probe** — `curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:<port>` with a 5s timeout. Expect 2xx/3xx. Non-2xx, connection refused, or timeout → investigate.
2. **UI smoke check (frontend projects)** — when the project is a frontend framework (Next.js, Vite, Remix, Astro, SvelteKit, Nuxt, Angular, Gatsby, Expo web), invoke the `browser-use` skill to load the root URL, take a screenshot, and check for a visible error overlay (Next.js red box, Vite overlay, React error boundary fallback). Report what you see.
3. **Backend-only projects** — if there's a known health/root route (`/health`, `/api/health`, `/`), `curl` it and show the status code. Otherwise one HTTP probe is enough.

If verification fails, surface it with the same classification as §4 (build/runtime/dependency/port) — don't just re-announce success.

### 4. React to errors

When a Monitor notification fires, surface *everything* the filter caught — do not silently drop items because they look minor. Claude's job is coverage; the user decides what to ignore.

1. **Classify** — build error, runtime exception, missing dependency, port conflict, type error, syntax error, warning, deprecation.
2. **Context** — quote the error, name the file and line if visible.
3. **Fix or ask** — for obvious issues (missing dep, typo, known pattern), suggest or apply the fix. For ambiguous ones, ask.
4. **Severity shape** — label each item (error / warning / info) so the user can filter; do not pre-filter on their behalf.

### 5. Stopping

When the user says "stop", "kill it", "shut down", or similar:
- `TaskStop` the Monitor
- Confirm stopped

## Edge cases

- **Monorepo**: If `package.json` has `workspaces` or there's a `turbo.json`/`nx.json`, ask which package. Or check for a root `dev` script.
- **Multiple servers**: Frontend + backend? Start each Monitor in the **same turn** (parallel Bash calls) with distinct descriptions like `"Rails API :3001"` and `"Vite web :5173"`. Don't serialize — they're independent.
- **Docker Compose**: If `docker-compose.yml` exists alongside a framework, mention both options.
- **Custom commands**: If the user says "run `XYZ` and watch it", skip detection — just run their command through the Monitor filter.
- **Turbopack**: If Next.js dev script includes `--turbo`, preserve it.

## Session continuity

The Monitor is `persistent: true` and outlives context compaction. If the conversation has been compacted and the user asks about the server, restate: framework, port, PID (from startup), and how long it's been running. Don't assume the user remembers which dev server was started.
