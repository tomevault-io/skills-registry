## When to Load This Skill

- Creating or reviewing a `.agent.md` file
- Choosing which tools to include (least-privilege applies — see ai-security SKILL)
- Designing a subagent workflow or handoff chain
- Configuring MCP servers in `.vscode/mcp.json`
- Setting up custom instructions or `copilot-instructions.md`
- Context engineering: what VS Code puts in the context window, and how to control it
- Any question about VS Code Copilot agent types, modes, or settings

---

## `.agent.md` Frontmatter — All Valid Fields

```yaml
---
description: <string>          # shown as placeholder in Chat input; one-sentence role summary
name: <string>                 # agent id; VS Code may infer from file name if omitted, but this repo sets it explicitly
tools: [<tool-name>, ...]      # allowed tools — see Built-in Tool Names below
agents: [<agent-name>, ...]    # allowed subagents; '*' = all, [] = none
model: <string | string[]>     # model name or priority list; if omitted = user's current picker
user-invokable: <bool>         # show in agents dropdown (default: true)
disable-model-invocation: <bool>  # prevent being called as subagent (default: false)
argument-hint: <string>        # hint text in chat input field
handoffs:                      # guided transitions to other agents
  - label: <string>            # button text
    agent: <agent-name>        # target agent id
    prompt: <string>           # pre-filled prompt for target
    send: <bool>               # auto-submit prompt (default: false)
    model: <string>            # model for the handoff (format: 'Model Name (vendor)')
target: vscode | github-copilot  # deployment target (default: vscode)
---
```

**Key rules:**
- **Repo convention (A1.1)**: set `name:` and keep it identical to the file base name (kebab-case) to avoid drift.
- Agent discovery depends on VS Code settings (commonly `chat.agentFilesLocations` includes `.github/agents`). If agents don't show up, verify discovery/diagnostics.
- `user-invokable: false` hides from dropdown but still allows subagent invocation
- `disable-model-invocation: true` blocks subagent invocation but keeps it in dropdown
- These two fields replace the deprecated `infer:` field

---

## Tool Names for `tools:` List (Framework-Aligned)

This framework standardizes on the tool names used in the canonical spec (e.g. `readFile`, `fileSearch`, `textSearch`).
VS Code/Copilot may expose additional tools depending on version/extension; when in doubt, consult the official “Agent tools reference”.

### File & code tools
| Tool name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `readFile` | Read file contents |
| `editFiles` | Edit existing files |
| `createFiles` | Create new files |
| `fileSearch` | Search files by name/glob |
| `textSearch` | Full-text search across workspace |
| `codebase` | Optional: semantic workspace search (often invoked via `#codebase`) |
| `usages` | Optional: find symbol usages and references (if available) |

### Execution tools
| Tool name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `runTerminal` | Run terminal commands |
| `problems` | Access Problems panel (linting, compiler errors) |
| `changes` | Access current source control changes |

### Network tools
| Tool name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `fetch` | Fetch URL content |
| `webSearch` | Web search |

### Agent tools
| Tool name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `agent` | Required when using `agents:` field (spawn subagents) |

**Tool sets**: some Copilot versions support referencing predefined groups (e.g. `#edit`, `#search`). If unsupported, list tools explicitly.

**MCP tools**: reference as `<server-name>/<tool-name>` or `<server-name>/*` for all tools of a server.

> Least-privilege rule (A1.6): give each agent only the tools required for its specific role.
> Critics: read-only only (`readFile`, `fileSearch`, `textSearch`).

---

## Tool Approval & Auto-Approve (`chat.tools.autoApprove`)

VS Code Copilot can require user confirmation for tool usage. The setting below can allow specific tools
to run without prompting.

**Architect guidance:**
- Prefer **no auto-approve** by default.
- If you enable auto-approve, scope it to the **lowest-risk, read-only** tools.
- Never auto-approve anything that can make **irreversible changes** (deleting resources, sending messages,
  writing to remote systems).

**Threat model reminder (A1.6):** tool auto-approval increases the blast radius of prompt injection and
mis-scoped agent permissions.

---

## Tool Sets (illustrative: `toolsets.jsonc`)

Tool sets let you reference a **named bundle of tools** instead of listing each tool repeatedly.
This helps keep `.agent.md` files short and makes least-privilege reviews easier.

**Architect guidance:**
- Use tool sets to encode role capabilities (e.g., `docs-readonly`, `repo-editor`) and keep them stable.
- Review tool sets like an API surface: changes can silently widen agent permissions.
- Prefer multiple small tool sets over one broad “kitchen sink” set.

> Note: some VS Code setups support a `toolsets.jsonc` (or equivalent) config for named tool bundles.
> This ForgentFramework repo does **not** ship a `toolsets.jsonc`; treat this section as conceptual
> guidance. Use `#fetch` on the official docs index at the bottom of this skill when you need the
> precise schema and lookup rules.

## Agent Types (VS Code)

| Type | Where it runs | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Local — Agent** | VS Code, interactive | Complex multi-file tasks, iterative work, needs editor/terminal context |
| **Local — Plan** | VS Code, interactive | Breaking down complex tasks before implementation; generates structured plan |
| **Local — Ask** | VS Code, interactive | Questions about codebase; read-only research |
| **Background agent** | VS Code, background | Well-defined tasks while you keep working |
| **Cloud agent** | GitHub, remote | Automated PRs, tasks requiring team collaboration, CI-style jobs |
| **Third-party agent** | External provider / extension / service | When a non-Microsoft agent workflow is required (policy-approved), e.g., vendor-specific capabilities or integrations not available via built-in agents |
| **Custom agent** | Local or cloud | Specialized persona: security reviewer, planner, architect, etc. |

**Selection guide (architect-facing):**

**Pick the execution *surface* first:**
- Needs continuous back-and-forth, live editor state, stack traces, linting → **Local — Agent**
- Needs a plan artifact first, before any changes → **Local — Plan**
- Needs read-only investigation / explanation → **Local — Ask**
- Needs autonomy while the user keeps coding in VS Code → **Background agent**
- Needs a PR-oriented workflow (review + CI), or work should continue without the user's machine → **Cloud agent**

**Then pick the *persona*:**
- Needs a specialized, stable role with least-privilege tools (critic, architect, compliance reviewer) → **Custom agent** (`.agent.md`)

**Use third-party agents only when necessary:**
- If the requirement is “a tool/integration”, prefer adding an **MCP tool** over introducing a new agent provider.
- If a third-party agent is required, confirm it is **policy-approved** and treat it as a **trust-boundary crossing** (A1.6): minimize shared context, avoid secrets, and prefer read-only tasks.

**Quick decision checklist (copy into your recommendation):**
- **Output**: chat answer vs code changes vs PR
- **Context need**: current editor state vs repo-only context
- **Runtime need**: terminal/linters/tests required?
- **Collaboration**: needs CI + review trail?
- **Risk**: any irreversible actions? → require explicit confirmation
- **Trust boundary**: any external/third-party processing? → minimize context and verify approvals

---

## Subagents

**What they are:** child agents with isolated context windows. Main agent waits for result, receives only the summary — not the full subagent conversation.

**When to use:**
- Offload research so main agent context stays focused
- Run multiple analyses in parallel (VS Code runs subagents concurrently)
- Isolate experimental work (dead ends don't pollute main context)
- Apply specialized behavior (use a security-reviewer custom agent as subagent)

**How to invoke in a prompt:**
```
Use a subagent to research OAuth 2.0 patterns for Node.js. Return a recommendation.
```

**In `.agent.md`:**
```yaml
tools: ['agent', 'readFile', 'fileSearch']
agents: ['forgent-docs-critic', 'forgent-process-critic']  # or '*' for all
```

**Key properties:**
- Synchronous: main agent blocks until subagent returns
- Parallel: multiple subagents can run concurrently
- Subagents start with a clean context window — they do NOT inherit main agent instructions
- `user-invokable: false` + subagent-only agents: used for internal pipeline steps

> Ref: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/agents/subagents

---

## Handoffs

Transition from one agent to another with context and a pre-filled prompt. Handoff buttons appear after a response completes.

```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: "Start Implementation"
    agent: forgent-spec-editor
    prompt: "Now implement the plan outlined above."
    send: false           # user reviews before submitting
  - label: "Review Changes"
    agent: forgent-process-critic
    prompt: "Review the changes made in the previous step."
    send: true            # auto-submits
    model: "Claude Sonnet 4.5 (copilot)"
```

**Use for:** plan → implement → review pipelines; multi-step workflows where human reviews each step.

---

## Context Engineering in VS Code

### How VS Code assembles context

1. **System prompt** — agent body from `.agent.md`
2. **Custom instructions** — from `copilot-instructions.md` + any `*.instructions.md`
3. **Conversation history** — compressed when context window fills
4. **Explicit `#`-mentions** — `#file`, `#codebase`, `#web`, `#changes`, etc.
5. **Automatic context** — current editor, workspace index, git state
6. **Tool outputs** — added per iteration in the agent loop

### Context sources reference

| `#`-mention | What it adds |
|---|---|
| `#file:<path>` | Specific file contents |
| `#codebase` | Semantic workspace search result |
| `#changes` | Current source control diff |
| `#problems` | Problems panel contents |
| `#web` | Web search result |
| `#fetch <url>` | URL content |
| `#githubRepo <owner/repo>` | GitHub repository search |

### Workspace index

- Remote index: built from committed state on GitHub/Azure DevOps — best for large codebases
- Local index: uncommitted changes, hybrid with remote
- Build index: **Build Remote Workspace Index** command in Command Palette
- `.gitignore` files are excluded from index (unless opened)

> Ref: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/workspace-context

---

## Custom Instructions vs SKILL.md

| | Custom instructions (`copilot-instructions.md`) | SKILL.md |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Coding standards, guidelines, always-on rules | Specialized capabilities, lazy-loaded knowledge |
| **When loaded** | Always (every chat interaction) | On-demand when relevant |
| **Content** | Instructions only | Instructions + scripts + examples + resources |
| **Standard** | VS Code-specific | Open standard (agentskills.io), portable |
| **Location** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `.github/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `~/.copilot/skills/` |

**Rule:** keep `copilot-instructions.md` short (~300 words). Move domain-specific knowledge to SKILL.md.

### SKILL.md detection locations

VS Code searches for skills in:
- `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` ← this repo's convention
- `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- User profile: `~/.copilot/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

To add more locations: configure `chat.agentSkillsLocations` in VS Code settings.

---

## MCP Server Configuration (`.vscode/mcp.json`)

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "<server-name>": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@scope/mcp-server"],
      "env": { "API_KEY": "${input:api-key}" }
    },
    "<remote-server>": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:token}" }
    }
  },
  "inputs": [
    { "id": "api-key", "type": "promptString", "description": "API Key", "password": true }
  ]
}
```

**Key rules:**
- `type: stdio` — server runs in foreground, communicates via stdin/stdout (no `-d` for Docker)
- `type: http` — VS Code tries HTTP Stream transport first, falls back to SSE
- Secrets via `${input:...}` — never hardcode credentials
- Tools available as `<server-name>/<tool-name>` in `tools:` lists
- Supply chain risk: every MCP server is a new attack surface (OWASP LLM06)

> Ref: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/mcp-configuration

---

## `.vscode/settings.json` — Agent Registration

```jsonc
{
  "chat.agentFilesLocations": {
    ".github/agents": true        // scan this folder for .agent.md files
  },
  "chat.agentSkillsLocations": [
    ".agents/skills"              // additional SKILL.md search path
  ],
  "chat.agent.enabled": true,     // must be true for agent mode
  "chat.tools.autoApprove": {}    // per-tool auto-approval config
}
```

**Architect guidance (minimal safe defaults):**
- Keep `chat.tools.autoApprove` empty unless you have a clear reason and a documented safety boundary.
- If you must add entries, prefer read-only tools first (search/read) and keep the list explicit.

## Coverage Checklist — Upstream `customization/` Docs

This skill now includes **explicit coverage** for every page currently in:
`https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/main/docs/copilot/customization`

**Upstream pages (folder contents):**
- `overview.md`
- `custom-instructions.md`
- `prompt-files.md`
- `agent-skills.md`
- `custom-agents.md`
- `hooks.md`
- `language-models.md`
- `mcp-servers.md`

> Design intent for multi-agent systems (A1.2): treat **custom instructions** as baseline constraints,
> **prompt files** as repeatable task macros, **custom agents** as tool-scoped personas,
> **skills** as portable capability packages, **MCP** as external tool surface, **hooks** as deterministic guardrails.

---

## Customization Overview — Choosing the Right Mechanism

Use this as a decision table when designing your agent system.

| Goal | Prefer | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Enforce global repo conventions | Custom instructions | Always included; low operational overhead |
| Different rules per language/folder | File-based instructions | Scoped by `applyTo` patterns |
| Repeatable single task (“do X”) | Prompt file (`.prompt.md`) | Explicit invocation via `/...` |
| Multi-step capability + assets | Agent Skill (SKILL.md + resources) | Progressive disclosure + portability |
| Specialist persona + tool boundary | Custom agent (`.agent.md`) | Least-privilege tools per role |
| External API / DB / browser / SaaS | MCP server | Adds tool capabilities beyond VS Code built-ins |
| Deterministic enforcement / automation | Hooks | Executes code at lifecycle events; can block tools |

**Prompt files vs custom agents:**
- Prompt file = “run this procedure” (task).
- Custom agent = “be this role” (persona + tool boundary + optional handoffs/subagents).

### Project bootstrap & diagnostics
- `/init` can generate a starter `.github/copilot-instructions.md` tailored to the workspace; treat it as a draft to review.
- If customizations don’t apply as expected: open Chat **Configure Chat (gear)** → **Diagnostics** and verify which agents/prompt files/instructions/skills are loaded and whether they have validation errors.

---

## Custom Instructions — Files, Scope, and Precedence

### Instruction types
- **Always-on** (applies to every request)
- **File-based** (applies when files match patterns or description matches task)

### Common file locations (workspace)
- Always-on: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- File-based: `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` (default)

### Additional supported sources (use intentionally)
- `AGENTS.md` (always-on instructions file supported by VS Code)
  - In this repo, `AGENTS.md` is also the orchestrator repo map.
  - If you also use it as Copilot instructions: keep it dual-purpose and avoid contradictions.
- `CLAUDE.md` (always-on for Claude-compat tooling)

### `.instructions.md` frontmatter (key fields)
- `applyTo`: glob pattern relative to workspace root (use `**` to apply to all)
- `name`, `description`: UI metadata; keep descriptions explicit so semantic matching works

### Settings you may need (diagnostics-oriented)
- `chat.instructionsFilesLocations` — add extra folders for instructions discovery
- `chat.useAgentsMdFile` — enable/disable `AGENTS.md` detection
- `chat.useNestedAgentsMdFiles` — nested `AGENTS.md` in subfolders (experimental)
- `chat.includeApplyingInstructions` — include pattern-matched instructions automatically
- `chat.includeReferencedInstructions` — include instructions referenced via Markdown links

### Priority model (conflict resolution)
When multiple sources exist, higher priority generally wins:
1. Personal/user instructions
2. Workspace/repository instructions
3. Organization-level instructions

### Portability & team rollout
- Organization-level instructions exist (GitHub org feature); use them for baseline policies across repos.
- Settings Sync can sync user prompt/instruction files across devices (look for the “Prompts and Instructions” sync category).

**Architect checklist (keep it effective and safe):**
- Keep always-on instructions short and stable; move deep procedures into skills.
- Explain the “why” behind non-obvious rules; include 1–2 examples for edge cases.
- Never embed secrets; reference env vars or input prompts only.

---

## Prompt Files (`.prompt.md`) — Slash Commands, Tools, Variables

### Locations
- Workspace: `.github/prompts/**/*.prompt.md`
- User profile: profile `prompts/` folder
- Configure additional locations with `chat.promptFilesLocations`

### Frontmatter fields (high-signal)
- `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`
- `agent`: `ask` | `agent` | `plan` | `<custom-agent-name>`
- `model`: optional; falls back to picker
- `tools`: optional; can include MCP tools and `<server>/*`

### Variable interpolation (design for reuse)
- Workspace: `${workspaceFolder}`, `${workspaceFolderBasename}`
- File context: `${file}`, `${fileBasename}`, `${fileDirname}`, `${fileBasenameNoExtension}`
- Selection: `${selection}`, `${selectedText}`
- Input: `${input:var}` / `${input:var:placeholder}`

### Tool list priority
If both prompt + agent specify tools, effective tools follow:
1. Prompt file tools
2. Tools from referenced custom agent
3. Default tools of selected agent

**Architect checklist:**
- Prefer prompt files for repeatable “one-shot” workflows.
- Use prompt files to *narrow* tools for a specific workflow, not broaden them.
- Reference instructions/skills via Markdown links instead of duplicating rules.

---

## Agent Skills — Progressive Disclosure and Portability

### What a skill is
- A folder containing `SKILL.md` (required) and optional resources/scripts.
- Skills are **auto-loaded on relevance** or **invoked via `/`**.

### Skill discovery and loading (3 levels)
1. **Discovery**: only `name` + `description` metadata is considered
2. **Instructions load**: body of `SKILL.md` is loaded when relevant
3. **Resource access**: other files in the skill folder are accessed on demand

### Skill frontmatter knobs
- `user-invokable: false` → hidden from slash menu, still auto-loadable
- `disable-model-invocation: true` → manual-only (no auto-load)

### Locations
- Project skills: `.github/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`
- Personal skills: `~/.copilot/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`
- Extend discovery with `chat.agentSkillsLocations`

**Architect checklist:**
- Put “how-to” + examples + scripts in skills; keep global instructions minimal.
- Write skill `description` like a classifier: capability + trigger phrases.
- Treat skills as a reusable library; version and review them like code.

---

## Custom Agents (`.agent.md`) — Personas, Tools, Subagents, Handoffs

This skill already contains the complete `.agent.md` frontmatter field list,
agent type guidance, subagent and handoff patterns.

**Add these customization-specific reminders:**
- Custom agents were formerly “custom chat modes”; `.chatmode.md` → `.agent.md`.
- If you declare `agents:` (subagents), ensure `tools:` includes `agent`.
- Handoffs are best for plan → implement → review workflows with human gates.

---

## Hooks — Deterministic Policy and Automation (Preview)

Hooks execute shell commands at lifecycle points and can block/ask/allow tool usage.

### Hook events (current set)
`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`,
`SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop`

### Hook config locations
- Workspace shared: `.github/hooks/*.hook.jsonc`
- Claude-compatible: `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`
- User: `~/.claude/settings.json`

### Security posture (A1.3)
- Hooks run with your VS Code permissions; treat them as executable code.
- Do not let agents freely edit hook scripts without manual approval.
- Validate/sanitize hook stdin JSON to avoid injection.

### Troubleshooting essentials
- Use Chat Diagnostics to see loaded hooks and validation errors.
- Check the Output panel channel for Copilot Chat Hooks to inspect stdout/stderr.
- If using `Stop`/`SubagentStop` “block” behavior, guard against infinite loops by respecting `stop_hook_active`.

---

## Language Models — Constraints That Affect Agent Design

Agent mode may restrict model availability to **tool-capable** models.

**Design implications:**
- Prefer explicit `model:` in a custom agent when output consistency matters.
- If relying on BYOK models, verify tool-calling capability and understand that
  some Copilot service steps may still occur (embeddings/indexing/intent routing).
- Treat “Auto model selection” as a performance feature, not a governance control.

**Also relevant knobs:**
- Inline chat can have a different default model via `inlineChat.defaultModel`.
- Inline suggestions use a separate completions model selection path; don’t assume chat model changes affect suggestions.

---

## MCP Servers — External Tool Surface and Trust

This skill already includes a baseline `.vscode/mcp.json` schema example.

**Add these operational/security essentials (A1.3 / LLM06):**
- Installing local MCP servers can run arbitrary code; review publisher and config.
- Prefer workspace `mcp.json` for team-shared config; user profile for personal tools.
- Use input variables / env vars; never hardcode secrets.
- Beyond tools, MCP can provide: **resources**, **prompts**, and **MCP apps**.
- Understand trust prompts: starting from config may bypass interactive trust UX.
