description: Lightweight workflow entry for Acode-kit. First action: check `.acode-kit-initialized.json` or the provider global cache. Keep the startup gate graph including Gate 3.5, Gate 4a, and Gate 4b plus 7 execution stages unchanged. Load workflow and standards progressively. Preserve gate control, stage order, and project-document governance. Use when this capability is needed.

# Acode-kit
Use this skill when:
1. the user wants a project delivered under the Acode-kit workflow
2. the user wants to continue an Acode-kit-managed project
3. the user explicitly mentions `Acode-kit`
4. the workspace shows Acode-kit project traces such as:
   - `.acode-kit-initialized.json`
   - `docs/project/ACTIVE_STANDARDS.md`
   - `docs/project/PROJECT_OVERRIDES.md`
   - `docs/project/PROJECT_EXTENSIONS.md`
5. another generic project-delivery skill also matches, but the task is clearly for an Acode-kit-managed project

## Precedence rule

Acode-kit is the canonical workflow entry for any Acode-kit-managed project.

1. if the user explicitly mentions `Acode-kit`, Acode-kit takes precedence over generic project-delivery skills
2. if the workspace contains Acode-kit project traces, Acode-kit must take over
3. if another similar high-level workflow skill also matches, do not hand off unless the user explicitly asks to leave the Acode-kit workflow
4. treat other generic project-builder skills as non-authoritative when Acode-kit project traces exist

## Core role

Acode-kit is the public workflow orchestrator. It owns:
1. startup gate control
2. stage transitions
3. document loading order
4. sub-agent delegation boundary
5. project-document governance

It does not replace:
1. `acode-kit init` for environment initialization
2. `acode-run` for internal routed execution
3. standards packages for detailed rules

## Entry guard

When the user invokes `Acode-kit`, stay in the main workflow entry.

1. Do not jump to `acode-run` on entry.
2. Do not treat `acode-run` as the startup executor.
3. Do not route Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Gate 3.5, Step 4a, or Step 4b through `acode-run`.
4. First complete the startup lane and wait at gates as required.
5. Only consider `acode-run` after Gate 4b, and only for a concrete routed subtask inside stage-driven execution.

## First action
Before anything else:

1. check `.acode-kit-initialized.json` in the workspace
2. if missing, check the provider global cache:
   - `~/.codex/acode-kit/.acode-kit-global.json`
   - `~/.claude/acode-kit/.acode-kit-global.json`
3. if neither exists, tell the user to run:
   - `node ~/.codex/skills/Acode-kit/scripts/acode-kit-init.mjs`
   - `node ~/.claude/Acode-kit/scripts/acode-kit-init.mjs`
4. stop until initialization exists

Never start with Pencil, editor-state tools, or code generation.
## Loading order
Read only the minimum needed, in this order:

1. this file
2. `integrations/shared/WORKFLOW_CORE.md`
3. provider adapter:
   - `integrations/codex/acode-kit.md`
   - `integrations/claude/acode-kit.md`
4. current workflow doc in `workflows/`
5. current load rule in `references/load-rules/`
6. required scenario / stack standards
7. project-level `ACTIVE_STANDARDS.md` and control docs

Do not bulk-read all workflows or all standards on entry.
## Workflow graph
Startup sequence:
1. Step 1: workspace status report
2. Gate 1: user approval
3. Step 2: requirements analysis + project skeleton
4. Gate 2: user approval
5. Step 3: PRD + progress plan
6. Gate 3: user approval
7. Gate 3.5: LMS tier confirmation
8. Step 4a: directory materialization + document relocation
9. Gate 4a: user approval
10. Step 4b: environment + engineering scaffold setup
11. Gate 4b: user approval

LMS governs execution density only:
1. `S` / `M` / `L` may change module granularity, batching width, and document expansion depth
2. `S` / `M` / `L` may not remove startup gates, Stage 1-7, or Step 5a-5e
3. every node still keeps its required inputs, outputs, review boundary, and standards obligations
4. smaller LMS tiers reduce scope breadth, not workflow rigor

Stage-driven execution:
1. Stage 1: requirements structuring + module decomposition
2. Stage 2: overall UI architecture
3. Stage 3: overall data model + API framework
4. Stage 4: project scaffold initialization
5. Stage 5: module iteration
6. Stage 6: integration testing + cross-module review
7. Stage 7: deployment and go-live

Stage 5 is fixed per module:
1. Step 5a
2. Step 5b
3. Step 5c
4. Step 5d
5. Step 5e

## Non-negotiable boundaries
1. no file or directory creation before Gate 3 approval
2. no design work before Gate 4b approval
3. Pencil/design tools only at Stage 2 and Step 5b
4. `Step 4a` and `Step 4b` are not `Stage 4`
5. do not skip or merge gates
6. do not skip stages when downstream outputs depend on them
7. wait for explicit user approval at every gate, stage review, and Step 5a-5e review
8. `Step 4a` must materialize the approved Step 2 / Step 3 outputs into project docs by direct relocation; `Step 4b` handles environment setup afterward
9. when an extension is loaded, tell the user which extension was used, what it did at the current node, and why it was helpful

## Workflow references
Use these files instead of expanding the main entry:

1. startup: `workflows/startup.md`
2. approvals and document updates: `workflows/gate-rules.md`
3. stage order and boundaries: `workflows/stage-execution.md`
4. module design / TDD / shadcn / access-info rules: `workflows/module-iteration.md`
5. major changes: `workflows/change-management.md`
6. tool and context degradation: `workflows/fallback-and-degrade.md`

## Standards routing
Use:
1. `references/load-rules/DOCUMENT_LOADING_RULES.md`
2. `references/load-rules/TASK_TO_STANDARD_MAP.md`
3. `references/load-rules/AGENT_DELEGATION_RULES.md`

Detailed standards live in:
1. `references/global-engineering-standards/`
2. `references/scenario-standards/`
3. `references/stack-standards/`

Project-level activation lives in:
1. `docs/project/PROJECT_OVERRIDES.md`
2. `docs/project/ACTIVE_STANDARDS.md`

## Router and delegation
`acode-run` is internal and not user-facing. Invoke it only for routed subtasks. Keep:
1. `project_id`, `phase`, `task_type`, `difficulty`, `provider`, `prompt`
2. optional `context_summary`, `logical_session_id`, `native_session_id`
3. fallback order: `error -> timeout -> quality_low -> budget_exceeded`

Hard boundary:
1. never invoke `acode-run` during startup Steps 1-4b or Gates 1-4b
2. never invoke `acode-run` as a replacement for the main `Acode-kit` workflow entry
3. invoke it only when the current stage already exists and the task is a bounded routed subtask
4. final gate decisions, stage review outputs, and user-facing conclusions stay in `Acode-kit`

Delegate bounded analysis only. Final gate decisions and final user-facing conclusions stay with the main agent.

## Session resume
When resuming an existing project, read first:
1. `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`
2. `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`

Continue from the recorded cursor. Do not re-run completed nodes.
## Language and output
1. use the user's language throughout
2. keep outputs review-ready and stage-specific
3. update project control docs before advancing

## Never do these
1. replace the declared tech stack on your own
2. jump straight to coding when project facts are missing
3. expand scope silently
4. write production code without a failing test first
5. let the user skip mandatory gates or stages
6. interpret Gate 3 as permission to start design
7. treat a missing MCP tool as a reason to abandon the workflow when a documented degradation exists
