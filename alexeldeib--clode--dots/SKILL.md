# Dots Task Management

Manages tasks using dots - a fast, minimal CLI task tracker that stores tasks as plain markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `.dots/`. Zero dependencies, git-friendly, perfect for AI agent workflows.

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `dot init` | Initialize `.dots/` directory | `dot init` |
| `dot add "title"` | Create new task | `dot add "Fix login bug"` |
| `dot ls` | List open/active tasks | `dot ls` |
| `dot on <id>` | Mark task as active | `dot on a1b2c3d` |
| `dot off <id>` | Complete and archive task | `dot off a1b2c3d` |
| `dot ready` | Show unblocked tasks | `dot ready` |
| `dot tree` | Show task hierarchy | `dot tree` |
| `dot show <id>` | Display task details | `dot show a1b2c3d` |
| `dot find "query"` | Search tasks | `dot find "auth"` |
| `dot rm <id>` | Delete task permanently | `dot rm a1b2c3d` |

### Task Creation Options

```bash
# Basic task
dot add "Fix the login bug"

# With priority (0=critical, 1=high, 2=normal, 3=low, 4=backlog)
dot add "Critical security fix" -p 0

# With description
dot add "Refactor auth" -d "Move JWT validation to middleware"

# As child of parent task
dot add "Write unit tests" -P parent-task-id

# Blocked by another task (dependency)
dot add "Deploy to prod" -a blocking-task-id

# Quick add (shorthand)
dot "Quick task title"
```

### Task Status Flow

```
open -> active -> done (archived)
```

- **open**: Created, not started
- **active**: Currently being worked on
- **done**: Completed, moved to `.dots/archive/`

### ID Format

IDs use format: `{prefix}-{slug}-{hex}` (e.g., `dots-fix-user-auth-a3f2b1c8`)

Commands accept short prefixes:
```bash
dot on a3f2b1    # Matches dots-fix-user-auth-a3f2b1c8
dot show a3f     # Error if ambiguous
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Planning a Feature

```bash
# Create parent task
dot add "Implement user authentication" -p 1
# Output: dots-impl-user-auth-a1b2c3d4

# Add subtasks
dot add "Design database schema" -P a1b2c3d4
dot add "Create API endpoints" -P a1b2c3d4 -a schema-task-id
dot add "Build login UI" -P a1b2c3d4 -a api-task-id
dot add "Write integration tests" -P a1b2c3d4 -a ui-task-id

# View hierarchy
dot tree
```

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Start of day: see what's ready
dot ready

# Pick a task and start working
dot on a1b2c3d

# Check active tasks
dot ls --status active

# Complete task with reason
dot off a1b2c3d -r "Fixed in commit abc123"
```

### Managing Dependencies

```bash
# Add dependency after creation
dot update <task-id> -a <blocking-task-id>

# View task to see what's blocking it
dot show <task-id>
```

## Claude Code Integration

dots has built-in hooks for seamless Claude Code integration.

### Hook Configuration

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "dot hook session"}]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "TodoWrite",
        "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "dot hook sync"}]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### What Hooks Do

- **SessionStart**: Shows active and ready tasks at conversation start
- **PostToolUse (TodoWrite)**: Syncs Claude's TodoWrite items to dots
  - Creates new dots for new todos
  - Marks dots as done when todos complete
  - Maintains mapping in `.dots/todo-mapping.json`

## Storage Format

Tasks stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```
.dots/
  task-id.md              # Root task
  parent-id/              # Parent with children
    parent-id.md          # Parent task
    child-id.md           # Child task
  archive/                # Completed tasks
  config                  # Project prefix
  todo-mapping.json       # TodoWrite sync state
```

### File Format

```markdown
---
title: Fix the bug
status: open
priority: 2
issue-type: task
created-at: 2024-12-24T10:30:00Z
blocks:
  - other-task-id
---

Description as markdown body here.
```

## Tips

- Use short ID prefixes for speed (first 7 chars usually unique)
- Run `dot slugify` to add readable slugs to existing IDs
- Archive keeps completed tasks accessible via `dot ls --status done`
- Use `dot purge` to permanently delete all archived tasks
- Tasks are git-friendly - commit `.dots/` to track project history
