Vault root: `/Users/alexismanuel/.config/opencode/`

## Command Structure

Commands are stored user prompts - markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

Load relevant skills if needed.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS
```

### Required Fields

### Naming

- Use kebab-case: `bootstrap-daily-note.md`
- Descriptive, concise names matching the command's purpose

## Creating Commands

1. Choose a descriptive name (kebab-case)
2. Create markdown file in `~/.config/opencode/command/`
3. Add YAML frontmatter with description
4. Write clear instructions for the agent
