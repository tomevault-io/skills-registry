# Create PRD Workflow

## Overview

Create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The PRD should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement the feature.

**Type:** FLEXIBLE - Adapt the dialogue and question depth to the complexity of the feature.

**Output:** `prd.md` with structured requirements, user stories, and success metrics.

**Related skill:** This workflow incorporates principles from the `brainstorming` skill. For pure design exploration without PRD output, use that skill directly.

## When to Use

Use this workflow when:
- User wants to formalize a feature idea into requirements
- Starting a new feature that needs clear specification
- Translating stakeholder requests into developer-ready requirements
- Creating documentation for handoff to implementation

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the create-prd workflow to help formalize these requirements."

## Process

### Step 1: Check Project Context First

Before asking questions, review relevant files, docs, and recent commits to understand the current state.

### Step 2: Receive Initial Prompt

The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality.

### Step 3: Ask Clarifying Questions (ONE AT A TIME)

- Ask questions **one at a time** - do not overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Prefer multiple choice** when possible (easier to answer)
- Open-ended questions are fine when choices aren't clear
- Goal: understand the "what" and "why", not the "how"
- Make sure to provide options in letter/number lists so the user can respond easily

### Step 4: Explore Approaches (2-3 options)

Before finalizing requirements:
- Propose 2-3 different approaches
- Present with trade-offs and your recommendation
- Get explicit agreement on approach before writing final PRD

### Step 5: Present PRD Incrementally

- Present the PRD in sections (200-300 words each)
- Check after each major section: "Does this look right so far?"
- Be ready to revise based on feedback

### Step 6: Save PRD

Save the finalized document as `prd.md`.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

Adapt questions based on the prompt. **Ask ONE question at a time.** Common areas to explore:

* **Problem/Goal:** "What problem does this feature solve? a) Users can't do X, b) System is slow at Y, c) Something else?"
* **Target User:** "Who is the primary user? a) End users, b) Admins, c) Both, d) Other?"
* **Core Functionality:** "What's the key action a user should perform?"
* **User Stories:** "Can you describe a typical usage scenario?"
* **Acceptance Criteria:** "How will we know it's done? What's the minimum viable version?"
* **Scope/Boundaries:** "What should this feature NOT do? (non-goals)"
* **Data Requirements:** "What data does this feature need?"
* **Design/UI:** "Any existing mockups or UI patterns to follow?"
* **Edge Cases:** "Any error conditions to consider?"

**Question discipline:**
- One question per message
- If a topic needs more exploration, break into multiple questions
- Prefer multiple choice (a/b/c) when possible
- Open-ended when choices aren't clear

## PRD Structure

The generated PRD should include the following sections:

1. **Introduction/Overview:** Briefly describe the feature and the problem it solves. State the goal.
2. **Goals:** List the specific, measurable objectives for this feature.
3. **User Stories:** Detail the user narratives describing feature usage and benefits.
4. **Functional Requirements:** List the specific functionalities the feature must have. Use clear, concise language (e.g., "The system must allow users to upload a profile picture."). Number these requirements.
5. **Non-Goals (Out of Scope):** Clearly state what this feature will *not* include to manage scope.
6. **Design Considerations (Optional):** Link to mockups, describe UI/UX requirements, or mention relevant components/styles if applicable.
7. **Technical Considerations (Optional):** Mention any known technical constraints, dependencies, or suggestions (e.g., "Should integrate with the existing Auth module").
8. **Success Metrics:** How will the success of this feature be measured? (e.g., "Increase user engagement by 10%", "Reduce support tickets related to X").
9. **Open Questions:** List any remaining questions or areas needing further clarification.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the PRD is a **junior developer**. Therefore, requirements should be explicit, unambiguous, and avoid jargon where possible. Provide enough detail for them to understand the feature's purpose and core logic.

## Output

* **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
* **Filename:** `prd.md`

## Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **One question at a time** | Don't overwhelm with multiple questions |
| **Multiple choice preferred** | Easier to answer than open-ended |
| **YAGNI ruthlessly** | Remove unnecessary features from requirements |
| **Explore alternatives** | Propose 2-3 approaches before settling |
| **Incremental validation** | Present PRD in sections, validate each |

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT start implementing the PRD
2. Check project context BEFORE asking questions
3. Ask clarifying questions ONE AT A TIME
4. Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs before finalizing
5. Present PRD incrementally, checking after each section
6. Take user feedback and improve the PRD

## Integration with Other Workflows

After PRD is complete, suggest:
- **workflow-research-codebase** - to understand implementation context
- **workflow-create-plan** - to create detailed implementation tasks
