# Validate Plan Workflow

## Overview

Validate that an implementation plan was correctly executed, verifying all success criteria and identifying any deviations or issues. Present structured completion options after verification passes.

**Type:** RIGID - Follow verification steps exactly. Don't skip test verification or present options before tests pass.

**Output:** Validation report with structured completion options.

## When to Use

Use this workflow when:
- Implementation phase is complete and needs verification
- Checking if plan tasks were executed correctly
- Preparing for merge request creation
- Validating work before handoff

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the validate-plan workflow to verify the implementation."

## Core Principles

From verification-before-completion skill:
- **Evidence before claims** - Run fresh verification before reporting anything as "done" or "passing"
- **Verify tests BEFORE options** - Don't present completion options until tests pass
- **Structured completion choices** - Present exactly 3 options when work is validated
- **Typed confirmation** - Require typed "discard" for destructive actions

## Initial Setup

When invoked:

### 1. Determine Context

Are you in an existing conversation or starting fresh?
- If existing: Review what was implemented in this session
- If fresh: Need to discover what was done through git and codebase analysis
- Check which worktree you're in: `git worktree list`

### 2. Locate the Plan

- If plan path provided, use it
- If not, look for the `./plan.md` file and use it if present
- Otherwise, search recent commits or ask user

### 3. Gather Implementation Evidence

```bash
# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -n 20
git diff HEAD~N..HEAD  # Where N covers implementation commits
git status
git worktree list      # Show all worktrees
```

### 4. CRITICAL: Verify Tests FIRST

**Before presenting any completion options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with completion validation until tests pass.
```

**STOP here. Don't proceed to Step 5.**

**If tests pass:** Continue to validation process.

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Context Discovery

If starting fresh or need more context:

1. **Read the implementation plan** completely
2. **Identify what should have changed**:
   - List all files that should be modified
   - Note all success criteria (automated and manual)
   - Identify key functionality to verify

3. **Spawn parallel research tasks** to discover implementation:
   ```
   Task 1 - Verify database changes:
   Research if migration [N] was added and schema changes match plan.
   Check: migration files, schema version, table structure
   Return: What was implemented vs what plan specified

   Task 2 - Verify code changes:
   Find all modified files related to [feature].
   Compare actual changes to plan specifications.
   Return: File-by-file comparison of planned vs actual

   Task 3 - Verify test coverage:
   Check if tests were added/modified as specified.
   Run test commands and capture results.
   Return: Test status and any missing coverage
   ```

### Step 2: Systematic Validation

For each phase in the plan:

1. **Check completion status**:
   - Look for checkmarks in the plan (- [x])
   - Verify the actual code matches claimed completion
   - Confirm worktree context is correct

2. **Run automated verification**:
   - Execute each command from "Automated Verification"
   - Document pass/fail status
   - If failures, investigate root cause

3. **Assess manual criteria**:
   - List what needs manual testing
   - Provide clear steps for user verification

4. **Think deeply about edge cases**:
   - Were error conditions handled?
   - Are there missing validations?
   - Could the implementation break existing functionality?
   - Will this work correctly in bare monorepo context?

### Step 3: Generate Validation Report

Create comprehensive validation summary:

```markdown
## Validation Report: [Plan Name]

### Implementation Status
- Phase 1: [Name] - Fully implemented
- Phase 2: [Name] - Fully implemented
- Phase 3: [Name] - Partially implemented (see issues)

### Automated Verification Results
- Build passes: `make build`
- Tests pass: `make test`
- Linting issues: `make lint` (3 warnings)

### Code Review Findings

#### Matches Plan:
- Database migration correctly adds [table]
- API endpoints implement specified methods
- Error handling follows plan

#### Deviations from Plan:
- Used different variable names in [file:line]
- Added extra validation in [file:line] (improvement)

#### Potential Issues:
- Missing index on foreign key could impact performance
- No rollback handling in migration

### Manual Testing Required:
1. UI functionality:
   - [ ] Verify [feature] appears correctly
   - [ ] Test error states with invalid input

2. Integration:
   - [ ] Confirm works with existing [component]
   - [ ] Check performance with large datasets

### Recommendations:
- Address linting warnings before merge
- Consider adding integration test for [scenario]
- Document new API endpoints
```

### Step 4: Present Completion Options

**Only present these options AFTER all verification passes.**

Present **exactly these 3 options:**

```
Implementation complete and verified. What would you like to do?

1. Push and create a Merge Request
2. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
3. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 5: Execute User's Choice

Based on user's selection (1-3), execute the appropriate workflow:

**Note:** When working with worktrees, ensure you're in the correct directory context before executing git commands.

#### Option 1: Push and Create Merge Request

Use `mr-generator` skill to generate intelligent MR descriptions from commits:

```bash
# Push worktree's branch
git push -u origin <feature-branch>

# Generate MR description with mr-generator
python3 <skill-path>/mr-generator/scripts/mr_generator.py --create --jira <ticket-id>

# Or manually create MR with description:
glab mr create --title "<title>" --description "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps from validation report>
EOF
)"
```

After MR creation, use `mr-tracker` skill to monitor review activity:
```bash
./scripts/mr_tracker.sh watch <mr-iid> 30  # Check every 30 seconds
```

#### Option 2: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping worktree <name>. All changes remain for later handling."

**Don't make any git changes.**

#### Option 3: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- Worktree <name>
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed:
```bash
# Navigate to main repository (not the worktree)
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/..

# Remove the worktree and its branch
git worktree remove <worktree-path> --force
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

## Working with Existing Context

If you were part of the implementation:
- Review the conversation history
- Check your todo list for what was completed
- Focus validation on work done in this session
- Be honest about any shortcuts or incomplete items
- Use `git worktree list` to identify the current worktree

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be thorough but practical** - Focus on what matters
2. **Run all automated checks** - Don't skip verification commands
3. **Document everything** - Both successes and issues
4. **Think critically** - Question if the implementation truly solves the problem
5. **Consider maintenance** - Will this be maintainable long-term?
6. **Evidence before claims** - Always show test/lint output before reporting status

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself:
- Reporting "done" without running verification
- Assuming tests pass from earlier runs
- Offering completion options when tests failed
- Using "should pass" or "looks good"
- Not showing verification command output

**STOP and run the verification commands first.**

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Skipping test verification | Ship broken code | Run tests BEFORE presenting options |
| Presenting open-ended next step | User doesn't know options | Present exactly 3 structured choices |
| Auto-deleting work | Lost progress | Require typed "discard" confirmation |
| Merging without verifying | Breaks base branch | Run tests on merged result |
| Wrong CLI tool (gh vs glab) | MR creation fails | Use `glab` for GitLab |

## Validation Checklist

Always verify:
- [ ] All phases marked complete are actually done
- [ ] Automated tests pass
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Manual test steps are clear
- [ ] Using correct Git repository/worktree context
- [ ] If creating MR (Option 1): Used `mr-generator` skill for description
- [ ] If MR created: Use `mr-tracker` skill to monitor review activity
