# Go Wails SQL Client Definition

## Product Direction

- Stack: Go 1.22+, Wails v2, React + TypeScript, database/sql, pgx v5, go-mssqldb.
- Product shape: local-first desktop SQL client for fast and reliable daily querying.
- Priority order: reliability > maintainability > performance > visual polish.
- Design language: explicit, compact, practical; avoid hidden behavior and decorative complexity.

## Core Philosophy

- Keep boundaries explicit: frontend, binding facade, application services, adapters, models.
- Keep abstractions earned: add interfaces only for real variation or test seams.
- Keep behavior observable: contextual errors, structured logs, deterministic state transitions.
- Keep changes local: one feature should mostly touch one ownership boundary.
- Keep extension points intentional: modularity where real long-term variability exists.

## Dependency Direction

```text
models <- adapters <- services <- wails facade <- frontend
utils can be shared but must not become a god package
```
