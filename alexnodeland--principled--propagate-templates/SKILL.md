# Propagate Templates — Canonical Copy Sync

Propagate canonical templates and scripts to all consuming skills, then verify zero drift.

## Command

```
/propagate-templates
```

## Workflow

### principled-docs — Template Propagation

Copy each canonical template to its consuming skill:

1. `plugins/principled-docs/skills/scaffold/templates/core/proposal.md` → `plugins/principled-docs/skills/new-proposal/templates/proposal.md`
2. `plugins/principled-docs/skills/scaffold/templates/core/plan.md` → `plugins/principled-docs/skills/new-plan/templates/plan.md`
3. `plugins/principled-docs/skills/scaffold/templates/core/decision.md` → `plugins/principled-docs/skills/new-adr/templates/decision.md`
4. `plugins/principled-docs/skills/scaffold/templates/core/architecture.md` → `plugins/principled-docs/skills/new-architecture-doc/templates/architecture.md`

### principled-docs — Script Propagation

Copy each canonical script to its consuming skill:

1. `plugins/principled-docs/skills/new-proposal/scripts/next-number.sh` → `plugins/principled-docs/skills/new-plan/scripts/next-number.sh`
2. `plugins/principled-docs/skills/new-proposal/scripts/next-number.sh` → `plugins/principled-docs/skills/new-adr/scripts/next-number.sh`
3. `plugins/principled-docs/skills/scaffold/scripts/validate-structure.sh` → `plugins/principled-docs/skills/validate/scripts/validate-structure.sh`

### principled-implementation — Script Propagation

Copy each canonical script to its consuming skills:

1. `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/decompose/scripts/task-manifest.sh` → `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/spawn/scripts/task-manifest.sh`
2. `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/decompose/scripts/task-manifest.sh` → `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/check-impl/scripts/task-manifest.sh`
3. `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/decompose/scripts/task-manifest.sh` → `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/merge-work/scripts/task-manifest.sh`
4. `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/decompose/scripts/task-manifest.sh` → `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/orchestrate/scripts/task-manifest.sh`
5. `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/decompose/scripts/parse-plan.sh` → `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/orchestrate/scripts/parse-plan.sh`
6. `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/check-impl/scripts/run-checks.sh` → `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/orchestrate/scripts/run-checks.sh`

### principled-implementation — Template Propagation

1. `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/spawn/templates/claude-task.md` → `plugins/principled-implementation/skills/orchestrate/templates/claude-task.md`

### principled-github — Script Propagation

Copy each canonical script to its consuming skills:

1. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-labels/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`
2. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-github/skills/pr-check/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`
3. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-github/skills/gh-scaffold/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`
4. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-github/skills/ingest-issue/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`
5. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-github/skills/triage/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`
6. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-github/skills/pr-describe/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`

### principled-quality — Cross-Plugin Script Propagation

Copy from the principled-github canonical source to principled-quality skills:

1. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-quality/skills/review-checklist/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`
2. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-quality/skills/review-context/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`
3. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-quality/skills/review-coverage/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`
4. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-quality/skills/review-summary/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`

### principled-release — Cross-Plugin Script Propagation

Copy from the principled-github canonical source to principled-release skills:

1. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-release/skills/changelog/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`
2. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-release/skills/release-ready/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`
3. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-release/skills/release-plan/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`
4. `plugins/principled-github/skills/sync-issues/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh` → `plugins/principled-release/skills/tag-release/scripts/check-gh-cli.sh`

### Verification

Run all five drift checks:

1. `bash plugins/principled-docs/skills/scaffold/scripts/check-template-drift.sh`
2. `bash plugins/principled-implementation/scripts/check-template-drift.sh`
3. `bash plugins/principled-github/scripts/check-template-drift.sh`
4. `bash plugins/principled-quality/scripts/check-template-drift.sh`
5. `bash plugins/principled-release/scripts/check-template-drift.sh`

Confirm all copies are byte-identical to their canonical sources. Report the result per plugin: PASS (zero drift) or FAIL (list drifted files).
