# Test Hooks — Enforcement Hook Smoke Tests

Smoke-test all enforcement hooks by feeding known good and bad inputs and verifying exit codes.

## Command

```
/test-hooks
```

## Workflow

### ADR Immutability Guard (`plugins/principled-docs/hooks/scripts/check-adr-immutability.sh`)

Run these test cases:

1. **Accepted ADR — should block (exit 2):**
   For each file in `docs/decisions/` with `status: accepted`, feed its path:

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"<path>"}}' | bash plugins/principled-docs/hooks/scripts/check-adr-immutability.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 2.

2. **Non-decision file — should allow (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"CLAUDE.md"}}' | bash plugins/principled-docs/hooks/scripts/check-adr-immutability.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0.

3. **Non-existent file — should allow (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"docs/decisions/999-nonexistent.md"}}' | bash plugins/principled-docs/hooks/scripts/check-adr-immutability.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0.

### Proposal Lifecycle Guard (`plugins/principled-docs/hooks/scripts/check-proposal-lifecycle.sh`)

Run these test cases:

1. **Accepted proposal — should block (exit 2):**
   For each file in `docs/proposals/` with status `accepted`, `rejected`, or `superseded`, feed its path. Expected: exit code 2.

2. **Draft proposal — should allow (exit 0):**
   For each file in `docs/proposals/` with status `draft`, feed its path. Expected: exit code 0.

3. **Non-proposal file — should allow (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"CLAUDE.md"}}' | bash plugins/principled-docs/hooks/scripts/check-proposal-lifecycle.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0.

### Manifest Integrity Advisory (`plugins/principled-implementation/hooks/scripts/check-manifest-integrity.sh`)

Run these test cases:

1. **Manifest file edit — should warn but allow (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":".impl/manifest.json"}}' | bash plugins/principled-implementation/hooks/scripts/check-manifest-integrity.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0, with advisory message on stderr.

2. **Unrelated file — should pass silently (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"src/index.ts"}}' | bash plugins/principled-implementation/hooks/scripts/check-manifest-integrity.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0, no output.

3. **Missing JSON input — should allow (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{}' | bash plugins/principled-implementation/hooks/scripts/check-manifest-integrity.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0 (guard scripts default to allow).

### PR Reference Advisory (`plugins/principled-github/hooks/scripts/check-pr-references.sh`)

Run these test cases:

1. **`gh pr create` command — should warn but allow (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"gh pr create --title \"test\" --body \"test\""}}' | bash plugins/principled-github/hooks/scripts/check-pr-references.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0, with advisory message on stderr.

2. **Unrelated command — should pass silently (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git status"}}' | bash plugins/principled-github/hooks/scripts/check-pr-references.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0, no output.

3. **Missing JSON input — should allow (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{}' | bash plugins/principled-github/hooks/scripts/check-pr-references.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0 (guard scripts default to allow).

### Review Checklist Advisory (`plugins/principled-quality/hooks/scripts/check-review-checklist.sh`)

Run these test cases:

1. **`gh pr review` command — should warn but allow (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"gh pr review 42"}}' | bash plugins/principled-quality/hooks/scripts/check-review-checklist.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0, with advisory message on stderr.

2. **`gh pr merge` command — should warn but allow (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"gh pr merge 42"}}' | bash plugins/principled-quality/hooks/scripts/check-review-checklist.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0, with advisory message on stderr.

3. **Unrelated command — should pass silently (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git status"}}' | bash plugins/principled-quality/hooks/scripts/check-review-checklist.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0, no output.

### Release Readiness Advisory (`plugins/principled-release/hooks/scripts/check-release-readiness.sh`)

Run these test cases:

1. **`git tag` command — should warn but allow (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git tag v1.0.0"}}' | bash plugins/principled-release/hooks/scripts/check-release-readiness.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0, with advisory message on stderr.

2. **`git tag -l` command — should pass silently (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git tag -l"}}' | bash plugins/principled-release/hooks/scripts/check-release-readiness.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0, no advisory (listing tags is not a release action).

3. **Unrelated command — should pass silently (exit 0):**

   ```bash
   echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git status"}}' | bash plugins/principled-release/hooks/scripts/check-release-readiness.sh
   ```

   Expected: exit code 0, no output.

### Reporting

For each test case, report PASS or FAIL with the actual vs expected exit code. Provide a summary at the end with total pass/fail counts.
