# Install Spinner

Install themed spinner verb packs for Claude Code from the
[awesome-claude-spinners](https://github.com/alexpl292/awesome-claude-spinners) repository.

## Install a Pack

1. Fetch the list of available spinner packs from GitHub:

```
https://api.github.com/repos/alexpl292/awesome-claude-spinners/contents/spinners

Parse the JSON response to get the list of `.json` files. Extract the pack names by removing the `.json` extension.

2. Present the packs to the user in a table with three columns: Pack name, a short description, and a couple of example verbs. Use this reference:

If a pack exists in the fetched list but is not in this table, still show it (with no description).

Ask the user to pick one.

3. Once the user picks a pack, fetch its contents from:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexpl292/awesome-claude-spinners/main/spinners/<pack-name>.json
```

4. Read the user's `~/.claude/settings.json` file.

5. Copy the `spinnerVerbs` field from the fetched spinner JSON into `~/.claude/settings.json`. If the `spinnerVerbs` field already exists in `settings.json`, replace its value. If it doesn't exist, create it.

IMPORTANT: Do not modify any other fields in `settings.json`. Only change `spinnerVerbs`.

6. After successful installation, print:

```
Spinner pack "<pack-name>" installed successfully!
No need to restart Claude Code — the new spinners are active immediately.
```

## Remove Spinners

If the user asks to remove or reset spinners, read `~/.claude/settings.json` and delete the `spinnerVerbs` field entirely. Do not modify any other fields. After removal, print:

```
Spinner pack removed. Default spinners are back.
No need to restart Claude Code — the change takes effect immediately.
```
