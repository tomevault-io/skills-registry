# Skill Auditor

Score any Claude Code skill against a 38-check rubric synthesized from Anthropic engineers, official documentation, and power user best practices.

## Three Modes

### `audit` — Read-only assessment (default)

Score one or all skills. No changes made.

```
/skill-auditor audit <skill-name>
/skill-auditor audit all
```

### `fix` — Propose and apply improvements

Audit first, then fix the highest-impact failures.

```
/skill-auditor fix <skill-name>
```

### `eval` — Generate eval criteria

Create binary yes/no eval questions and test prompts for a skill.

```
/skill-auditor eval <skill-name>
```

## Progress Tracking

Use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate to track progress throughout the audit. Create tasks at session start, update as each phase completes.

**For `audit` mode (single skill):** One task: "Score [skill-name] against 38-check rubric"

**For `audit all` mode:** Task per phase: "Phase 1: Score all N skills", "Phase 2: Compile gap report". Mark each in_progress when starting, completed when done.

**For `fix` mode:** Task per batch: "Batch 1: Descriptions", "Batch 2: Gotchas", etc. Add "Verify batch N" after each commit.

**For `eval` mode:** One task: "Generate eval criteria for [skill-name]"

Always mark tasks completed before moving to the next phase.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Deterministic Checks (Script)

Run the scoring script on the target skill:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/score_skill.py" <skill-directory> --siblings-dir <skills-root> --max-lines 300
```

**With project conventions** (e.g., for R projects with rules files):

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/score_skill.py" <skill-directory> --conventions <rules-file> --max-lines 300 --siblings-dir <skills-root>
```

The script scores 17 deterministic checks: frontmatter format, description quality (D1-D7), content efficiency (C2-C5), gotchas heading (G1), example structure (E1, E5), scripts presence (V2), and sibling references (O4). Use `--format table` for human-readable output. Outputs structured JSON by default.

### Phase 2: Judgment Checks (Claude)

Read `references/audit-rubric.md` for the full 38-check rubric.

Using the script's JSON output plus your own reading of the SKILL.md content, score the remaining checks that require judgment:

**Content efficiency (C1, C3, C6, C7):**
- Read the skill. Is there content Claude already knows well? Flag it.
- Is terminology consistent throughout?
- Any time-sensitive information?

**Gotchas (G1-G6):**
- Does a dedicated Gotchas/Pitfalls section exist?
- Are the gotchas real failure points or hypothetical?
- Scan for ambiguous instructions (Drifter prevention).
- Check for scope constraints (Overachiever prevention).

**Examples (E1-E5):**
- Are there input/output pairs or just prompt-only examples?
- Happy path AND edge case covered?
- Do code examples follow project conventions?

**Scripts & Verification (V1-V5):**
- Is there a feedback loop for quality-critical operations?
- Are scripts provided for deterministic tasks?
- Clear execution vs reference distinction?

**Orchestration (O1-O4):**
- Run `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_frontmatter.py" <skills-root>` to extract all sibling descriptions and detect territory overlaps.
- Map territory boundaries using the overlap warnings from the script.
- Check for cross-references to sibling skills (O4 is partially automated by score_skill.py).

**Testability (T1-T4):**
- Can you define 3-6 binary eval questions for this skill?
- Can you meaningfully A/B test it vs raw Claude?
- Are success criteria specific enough to operationalize?

### Phase 3: Report

Generate a report card per skill:

```
## Skill: <name>
Score: X/38

D: Description Quality     ███████ X/7
C: Content Efficiency      ███████ X/7
G: Gotchas                 ██████░ X/6
E: Examples                █████░░ X/5
V: Scripts & Verification  █████░░ X/5
O: Orchestration           ████░░░ X/4
T: Testability             ████░░░ X/4

### Failures
| Check | Finding | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| D3    | No negative boundaries in description | HIGH |
| G1    | No Gotchas section | HIGH |
| ...   | ... | ... |

### Top 3 Fixes
1. [highest impact fix]
2. [second highest]
3. [third highest]
```

**Impact priority:** D > G > O > C > E > T > V

### Auditing All Skills

When `$ARGUMENTS` is "all" or "audit all":

1. Glob all `skills/*/SKILL.md` in the project
2. Run `extract_frontmatter.py` to get all descriptions and overlap warnings
3. Dispatch parallel subagents (3 skills per subagent). Each runs Phase 1 + Phase 2.
4. Collect all report cards. **Do NOT trust subagent arithmetic** — subagents systematically miscount P/F totals.
5. Use `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/aggregate_report.py" <scores-dir> --output audit-gap-report.md` to compile the gap report. The script recomputes all totals from individual P/F detail rows.
6. Save report to `docs/superpowers/specs/audit-gap-report.md`

## Fix Mode

When mode is `fix`:

1. Run the full audit first
2. Read `references/remediation-guide.md` for fix strategies
3. Read `references/failure-modes.md` to diagnose failure patterns
4. Address failures in priority order: D → G → O → C → E → T → V
5. For each fix, show the before/after diff and explain why
6. After each batch of fixes, run `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/verify_batch.py" <skills-root> --all --max-lines 300` to validate constraints
7. Re-run the deterministic script after changes to verify improvement

## Eval Mode

When mode is `eval`:

1. Read the skill thoroughly
2. Generate 3-6 binary yes/no eval questions (autoresearch method)
3. Generate 3+ representative test prompts (happy path, edge case, boundary)
4. Define specific success criteria per test prompt
5. Write to `skills/<name>/eval.md` (development-only, not loaded by plugin)

## Gotchas

**Description ≠ summary.** The most common audit failure is a description that summarizes the skill instead of specifying when to trigger. Descriptions are triggers, not documentation.

**Obvious content is invisible waste.** Skills that restate what Claude already knows consume tokens without adding value. The hardest audit judgment is deciding what Claude "already knows" — err on the side of cutting.

**Not every skill needs scripts.** V-section checks apply selectively. A pure-instruction skill (code review guidelines, writing conventions) may legitimately score 0/5 on scripts. Flag it but don't penalize.

**Orchestration needs ALL siblings.** You cannot audit O-section for a single skill in isolation. You must read all sibling skill descriptions to detect overlaps and missing boundaries.

**Meta-skills need adapted criteria.** Skills that generate or operate on other skills (e.g., r-package-skill-generator) may need different E-section expectations — their "examples" might be generated skill outputs, not user-facing code. Use skill-auditor for auditing these skills, but use r-package-skill-generator (not skill-auditor) when the goal is to generate a new skill from a GitHub package repo.

**Subagent arithmetic is unreliable.** All 5 subagents in the 15-skill audit miscounted P/F totals (e.g., 4 passes reported as "3/7"). Always recompute from individual P/F detail rows using `aggregate_report.py`, never trust subagent section totals.

**Line budget management.** After adding Gotchas + Examples sections, skills approach line limits. Track remaining budget with `verify_batch.py --all` before starting content additions.

## Examples

### Happy Path: Audit a single skill

```
> /skill-auditor audit r-stats

## Skill: r-stats
Score: 31/38

D: Description Quality     ███████ 7/7
C: Content Efficiency      █████░░ 5/7
G: Gotchas                 ██████░ 6/6
E: Examples                ████░░░ 4/5
V: Scripts & Verification  ████░░░ 4/5
O: Orchestration           ███░░░░ 3/4
T: Testability             ██░░░░░ 2/4

### Failures
| Check | Finding                          | Impact |
|-------|----------------------------------|--------|
| C3    | Terminology inconsistency: mixed "model" / "fit" | MEDIUM |
| T2    | No binary eval questions defined | LOW    |
| ...   | ...                              | ...    |
```

### Edge Case: Fix mode with before/after diff

```
> /skill-auditor fix r-visualization

Fixing D3 (negative boundaries missing from description)...

- description: >
-   Use when creating ggplot2 visualizations...
+ description: >
+   Use when creating ggplot2 visualizations...
+   Do NOT use for Shiny reactive plots (use r-shiny),
+   statistical model diagnostics (use r-stats), or
+   clinical forest plots (use r-clinical).

Re-running deterministic checks... D3: PASS (was FAIL)
Score: 34/38 → 35/38
```

**More example prompts:**

- "Audit the r-stats skill against the full rubric"
- "Run the skill auditor on all skills and generate a gap report"
- "Fix the description for r-visualization based on audit findings"
- "Generate eval criteria for the r-tdd skill"
- "Score my new skill-auditor skill against the 38-check rubric"
