# Session Checkpoint

## Dominant Variable
Has **what the next session must know** been clearly identified? If that identification is incomplete, go deeper on Phase 1 — compact comes after.

## Discard If
- No code changes and no open decisions this session → compact not needed
- Already ran checkpoint this session → skip, no duplicate
- Only want to update the handoff file directly → edit `memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md` manually

---

## Core Principles
- Handoff is a **single file** (`memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md`) — no version numbers
- Completed items get **deleted**, not archived
- The next session must be able to start from this file alone
- Preservation check before compact — always

---

## Phase 1: Deep Context Extraction

Extract what compact could destroy. Full Compact preserves these 9 categories — cover all that apply:

- **Open decisions** — discussed but not resolved
- **Current work state** — what is in-progress right now (file, function, where you left off)
- **User priority signals** — what was emphasized, repeated, or caused friction → save as feedback memory
- **Key tech concepts** — new patterns, APIs, architecture insights discovered this session
- **File paths + code snippets** — specific files modified, function names, critical code fragments (compact loses these)
- **Errors + fixes** — error messages encountered and how they were resolved
- **Current mental model** — code flow, bug causation, failed approaches and why they failed
- **Next steps** — concrete actions for next session (with commands if applicable)
- **Dead ends** — approaches tried and abandoned this session (prevent repetition next session)

---

## Phase 1.5: Entity Extraction

> **Auto-trigger recommendation** (heuristic):
> Accumulated tokens ≥ 5,000 AND tool calls ≥ 3 AND ≥ 24h since last checkpoint
> → When all three conditions hit simultaneously, checkpoint is recommended. Same criteria apply on manual invocation.

Scan the session conversation for four entity types:

**① Permanent fact candidates** → promote to `memory/MEMORY.md`
- Newly discovered file paths / function names / architecture decisions
- New external tools / APIs / libraries (confirm installed)
- New hard rules or constraints
- Criterion: still true next session

**② Episode entries** → append to `memory/context-log.md` (TTL tag required)
- Completion events, external events, future plans
- TTL rules: `ttl:permanent` (decisions/architecture) | `ttl:90d` (completions/plans) | `ttl:30d` (temporary states)
- Format: `[DATE] [TYPE] [ttl:Nd] [ref:0] description`

**③ Raw observations / patterns** → preserve exact user phrasing
- Insights, judgments, or frustrations expressed directly by the user
- Candidates for `tasks/lessons.md` if they describe a repeated mistake
- **lessons.md v2 metadata enrichment**: For new lessons, add a metadata line below the header: `> conf: 0.5 · seen: today · obs: 1`. On re-observation/re-application of an existing lesson, update `seen` to today and increment `obs`. After obs reaches 3 / 6 / 9, raise `conf` by +0.1 (max 0.9). On user correction after a violation, lower `conf` by -0.1 (min 0.3) and update `seen`.

**④ Stale detection** → force MEMORY.md promotion
- Items in `memory/context-log.md` with `[ref:N]` where N ≥ 3 → check if they belong in MEMORY.md
- Same entity appearing 3+ times → add to MEMORY.md if not already there

**⑤ Optional: Snapshot Cleanup (90-day policy)**

If your project has a snapshots directory for session state snapshots, optionally check for outdated files:
- Files older than 90 days can typically be archived or deleted
- This is optional and only relevant if your project maintains such a directory
- Not applicable to most projects; skip if not using snapshots

---

## Phase 1.6: Repeated Workflow Detection

> **Purpose**: detect repeated manual workflows that could be promoted to a reusable skill. The point where "manual repetition 3 times" signals "this should become a skill call".

Scan this session's tool calls and user messages for **repeated workflow signatures**.

**Signature definition:**
Three elements of the same workflow must be similar:
1. **Intent** — user request type (review / analyze / verify / generate / deploy)
2. **Tool Sequence** — executed tool-call pattern (e.g., Read → Grep → Edit → Bash test)
3. **Output Shape** — final deliverable form (report / code change / file creation)

**Detection triggers (either one):**
- **Within-session repetition**: same signature executed **≥ 3 times** this session
- **Cross-session accumulation**: `[ref:N]` in `memory/context-log.md` for the same task type ≥ 5

**Output format when detected:**
```
[Repeated workflow candidate detected]
- Signature: {Intent} + {Tool Sequence} + {Output Shape}
- Frequency: {N} this session / {M} accumulated
- Suggestion: this workflow might benefit from a dedicated skill
- Proposed skill name: {snake_case_name}
- Proposed triggers: {trigger phrases — 3 examples}
```

**Non-trigger conditions (skip proposal):**
- One-off exploration (single Glob → Read)
- Signature duplicates an existing skill — scan `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` to confirm
- Signature is too generic → would collide with an already-established skill

**Promotion workflow:**
Proposal only. Never author the skill automatically.
If user approves ("yes" / "approve" / "make it") → user invokes their skill-authoring workflow.
If user declines ("no" / "pass" / "skip") → drop proposal, optionally log to `tasks/lessons.md` for future reference.

## Phase 2: Write Handoff (single file update)

File: `memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md`

### Rules
1. **Read the previous handoff first** (auto-loaded above) — remove completed items
2. Update status of in-progress items
3. Add newly surfaced items
4. **Do not archive completed items** — just delete them. Git history preserves them.

### Required Sections

```markdown
## Next Actions (priority order)
1. [most urgent] — include the exact command or step to start
2. [next]

## Current Work State  ← Full Compact 2nd priority required
- In-progress work: [file, function, where you left off]
- Omit section if nothing in-progress

## Open Decisions
- [topic]: [options] — user lean: [if known]

## Remaining Issues
- [unresolved bugs or blockers]

## Context Notes (needed next session)
- [important causation discovered this session]
- [approaches tried and failed — do not repeat]
- [critical file paths and function names — for post-compact recovery]

## Current Focus
- Top priority: [what]
- Friction: [what]
```

### Forbidden
- Listing "what was done this session" — handoff is forward-looking only
- Version numbers (v1, v2, v3…)
- Keeping completed items
- Exceeding 200 lines

---

## Phase 3: Save Memory

Apply Phase 1.5 extraction results to files:

1. **`memory/MEMORY.md`** — add permanent fact candidates to the relevant section (rewrite section, never append raw)
   - Check for duplicates before adding (skip or update if already present)
   - Stale items (contradicted by current state) → fix immediately
2. **`memory/context-log.md`** — append episode entries (date + TTL + ref:0 format required)
3. **`tasks/lessons.md`** — add behavior correction rules triggered this session (only if a real mistake occurred). If the file does not exist, create it first with a minimal header before writing:
   ```markdown
   # Lessons
   <!-- conf scale: 0.3 (tentative) → 0.5 (moderate) → 0.7+ (verified) -->
   <!-- Format: ### [YYYY-MM-DD] Title / > conf: X · seen: YYYY-MM-DD · obs: N / body -->
   ```
   - **v2 format**: For new lessons, the header `### [YYYY-MM-DD] title` is followed by a metadata line `> conf: 0.5 · seen: YYYY-MM-DD · obs: 1`
   - **On re-observation**: locate the existing lesson header → update `seen` to today, increment `obs`. After obs reaches 3 / 6 / 9, raise `conf` by +0.1 (max 0.9)
   - **On violation + user correction**: lower `conf` by -0.1 (min 0.3), update `seen` to today
   - **Periodic cleanup** (optional): `conf < 0.4 AND (today − seen) > 90 days` → move to archive folder
   - Backward compatible: lessons without v2 metadata are unchanged
4. Remove references to old handoff filenames in MEMORY.md index; unify to LATEST.
5. **Optional cross-project state file** — if your project maintains a STATE.md or similar cross-project state:
   - Resolved blockers → remove the entry
   - Completed items → remove the entry
   - Major milestones → optionally add to changelog
   - No change → skip entirely (do not touch)

---

## Phase 4: Preservation Check

Checklist before compact:
```
□ Open decisions are in the handoff?
□ Session feedback saved to memory?
□ Next session can start from handoff alone?
□ In-progress code changes are described?
□ User's last request is complete or recorded?
□ STATE.md reviewed? (skip if no state change this session)
```
Any NO → fix before proceeding.

---

## Phase 5: Compact Guidance

> ⚠ **NO_TOOLS mode**: `/compact` disables all tools during compression — no file reads or writes occur. All Phase 1–4 data must be persisted to files BEFORE running `/compact`.

`/compact` is a Claude Code CLI built-in — this skill cannot call it directly.
After passing the checklist, tell the user:

"Checkpoint complete. Run `/compact` to compress context. Handoff: `memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md`"

---

## Safety Layers

| Risky Action | Notes |
|---|---|
| Overwriting `MEMORY.md` existing sections | Read current content first; overwrite section in place, never append raw |
| Deleting state entries | Verify the condition was actually met before removing |
| Workflow promotion to skill | Proposal only — user must explicitly approve before any skill is created |

## Truthful Reporting

After saving files:
1. Report `"saved"` only after verifying the write succeeded (file size / line count).
2. Phase 4 checklist items actually skipped → mark `⚠️ SKIPPED: reason`. No phantom passes.
3. Final status: `WORKING` (all 5 phases complete) / `PARTIAL` (specific gaps listed) / `BROKEN` (handoff save failed).

---

## Scope Boundary

| Does | Does NOT |
|------|----------|
| [WRITE] Record incomplete items in handoff file | Preserve completed items (delete is correct) |
| [EDIT] Update MEMORY.md with new/stale items | Write code or implement features |
| [READ] Run Phase 1–5 preservation checklist | Call `/compact` directly (CLI only) |
| [WRITE] Maintain single handoff file | Create versioned handoff files (v1, v2…) |
| [AGENT] Propose Crystallization candidates (Phase 1.6) | Author a new skill automatically (only after user approval) |
| [EDIT] Update STATE.md when state changes | Rewrite STATE.md content entirely |

---

## Invariants (never violate)

1. **Single handoff file**: only `memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md` exists. No versioned files (`session-handoff-v2.md` etc.). Violation → next session cannot determine which file is current, context recovery fails.

2. **Forward-looking only**: handoff must not list "what was done this session." Only "what to do next session." Violation → handoff becomes a changelog and the actual starting point is lost.

3. **No compact guidance before preservation check**: if any Phase 4 item is NO, do not tell the user to compress. Violation → incomplete work is lost in compression.

4. **Workflow promotion proposes only, never executes**: when Phase 1.6 detects a repeated workflow, it only suggests that a skill might be useful. Never auto-create a skill — user must explicitly decide and invoke a skill-authoring workflow. Violation → unnecessary skills generated from one-off exploration pollute the library.

---

## Output

- **`memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md`** — incomplete items + open decisions + remaining issues only. Max 200 lines.
- **Memory files** — MEMORY.md updated for new/stale items (if applicable)
- **Conversation** — compact readiness confirmation + `/compact` instruction

---

## Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Counter |
|-----------------|---------|
| "Completed items are useful for reference, keep them" | No. Keeping them turns the handoff into a changelog. Git history preserves them. Delete is the correct action. |
| "Phase 4 has one NO but it's probably fine..." | Invariant 3. The checklist exists precisely for this moment. NO state → do not guide compression. |
| "I'll save it as session-handoff-v2.md so we keep the old one too" | Invariant 1 violation. Git history keeps old versions. Versioned files cause "which one is current?" confusion that breaks context recovery. |
| "The session was short, Phase 1.5 isn't worth running" | Phase 1.5 takes 2 minutes. Missing one permanent fact means next session re-discovers it. Run it. |
| "Phase 1.6 detected a repetition — let me just author the skill right now" | Invariant 4 violation. User must judge whether the task will actually repeat. Auto-promotion turns one-off exploration into skills. Propose only. |
| "A repeated workflow was detected but the signature is too trivial, skip it" | If it matches Phase 1.6's "non-trigger conditions," fine. But dismissing 3+ repetitions as "trivial" is usually measurement laziness. Log it to `context-log.md [ref:N]` so the next session re-evaluates. |

## Pair

This skill is the closing half of the session lifecycle.
`/session-start` → work → `/session-checkpoint`

Install both or neither — they are designed as a pair.

---

## Proven In

Session handoff workflows across multi-week development projects.
Once a codebase grows beyond ~200 files and multiple sessions span days,
a single handoff file becomes the difference between "pick up immediately"
and "20 minutes reconstructing context."
