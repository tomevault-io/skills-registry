description: Claude Code agent infrastructure setup — interview-based, domain-preset-driven. Use when: user says '/harness-init', 'rules 만들어', 'harness 설정', 'agent routing 설정', 'AI 설정 해줘', '에이전트 설정', 'hooks 설정', 'harness setup', 'CLAUDE.md 규칙 설정'. NOT for project scaffolding (use project-init for that). Generates rules, hooks, memory, agent routing with substance, not skeletons. Use when this capability is needed.

# Harness Init — Claude Code Agent Infrastructure Setup

## Purpose
Set up the full Claude Code harness layer — rules, hooks, memory, agent routing.
Not project scaffolding (use `/project-init` for that). This is the AI orchestration layer.

Key difference from generic templates: domain presets provide **pre-filled rules with real content**,
not empty skeletons. Every harness includes reject-by-default and violation testing.

**Dominant variable**: 생성된 ai-constitution.md의 Tier 0 규칙이 violation testing을 통과하는가 — 테스트 없는 규칙은 장식이다.
**Discard if**: 이미 완성된 harness가 있고 단일 규칙 추가만 필요한 경우 — 해당 rule 파일을 직접 편집.

---

## Phase 0: Prerequisites

### Existing File Check (overwrite protection)
Check each target file before generating:

| File | If exists |
|------|-----------|
| `~/.claude/rules/ai-constitution.md` | Read it. Offer: update (extend) or replace. Default: update. |
| `~/.claude/rules/agents.md` | Read it. Merge new agent definitions, never replace existing ones. |
| `~/.claude/rules/output-style.md` | Read it. Offer: update or replace. |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` (hooks) | Always merge — append to existing arrays, never overwrite. |
| `memory/MEMORY.md` | Read it. Append new sections, preserve existing entries. |
| `tasks/lessons.md` | If exists → read it. Contains AI behavior correction rules from past sessions. |

**Merge algorithm for hooks (settings.json):**
```
1. Read existing settings.json
2. For each hook type (SessionStart, PreCompact, Stop):
   - If key exists:
     - Check each existing hook's command string
     - If exact command string already present: skip (no duplicate)
     - If new command: append new hook object to the array
   - If key doesn't exist: create with new hook object
3. Write merged result back
```
Never replace the entire hooks object. Never delete existing hook entries.

Check if `CLAUDE.md` exists in the project root.
- If yes → read it for context (Hard Rules, stack, conventions)
- If no → recommend running `/project-init` first, but don't block

**Hard Rules conflict check** (if both `CLAUDE.md` and `~/.claude/rules/ai-constitution.md` exist):
1. Extract Hard Rules from CLAUDE.md
2. Compare with Tier-0 rules in ai-constitution.md
3. If divergent:
   - Rules in CLAUDE.md not in ai-constitution.md → propose adding them to ai-constitution.md
   - Rules in CLAUDE.md weaker than ai-constitution.md → flag: "CLAUDE.md has a weaker version, remove it"
4. If identical or CLAUDE.md just has a reference link → no action needed
5. Recommended outcome: CLAUDE.md contains only `Hard Rules → see [.claude/rules/ai-constitution.md](.claude/rules/ai-constitution.md)`, actual rules live only in ai-constitution.md

Check if `~/.claude/` global structure exists.
- Read existing rules to detect conflicts before generating.
- If no global rules exist → this will be the first setup.

---

## Phase 1: Domain Selection (determines everything else)

### Q1 — Domain Preset
```
What kind of system are you building?

1. Trading / Finance — no-action default, no fabrication, paper-only
2. Web Application — secrets protection, input validation, auth-first
3. CLI Tool / Automation — idempotent operations, dry-run default
4. Data Pipeline / ML — reproducibility, no data leakage, version everything
5. General — start minimal, add rules as needed
6. Custom — describe your domain

Your choice determines which hard rules are pre-loaded.
You can add, modify, or remove any of them afterward.
```

After Q1, load the matching preset (see Presets section below).
Show the user what's pre-loaded and ask: "Anything to add, change, or remove?"

### Q2 — Agent Complexity (adapts based on Q1)

```
How complex is your AI agent setup?

- Minimal: rules + memory only. No agent routing.
  → Generates: rules/, memory/, hooks. Done.

- Standard: review agents (code review, testing, verification).
  → Generates: + agent routing, review gates

- Orchestrated: multi-agent with routing, sub-agents, parallel execution.
  → Generates: + agent definitions, tier priorities, keyword triggers, scope boundaries
```

**If Q2 = Minimal → skip Q3. Go to Phase 2.**
**If Q2 = Standard → ask Q3 simplified.**
**If Q2 = Orchestrated → ask Q3 full.**

### Q3 — Review Gates (only if Q2 >= Standard)

**Standard version:**
```
Which review steps before code ships?

- Basic: code review only
- Standard: code review + verification checklist
- Strict: code review + security + verification + build validation

Start with Basic if unsure. Add more after your first production incident.
```

**Orchestrated version (two questions):**

*Q3a — Gate selection:*
```
Which review gates do you want? (check all that apply)

  code-reviewer — finds issues, severity scoring, never fixes directly
  security-reviewer — secrets exposure, injection, OWASP Top 10
  verification — mandatory checklist before declaring "done"
  build-error-resolver — fixes build/type errors only, no refactoring
  database-reviewer — SQL injection, missing indexes, N+1 queries
```

*Q3b — Per-gate config (ask separately for each selected gate):*
```
For [gate-name]:
- When does it trigger? (every commit? before push? before merge?)
- What should it catch specifically for your project?
- Blocking (nothing ships until fixed) or advisory (flag and continue)?
```

**Agent existence check (before generating agents.md):**
Scan BOTH `~/.claude/agents/` (global) AND `.claude/agents/` (project-level) for each selected agent. If missing in both:
```
"[agent-name] 에이전트 파일이 ~/.claude/agents/에 없습니다.
agents.md에 라우팅만 등록하면 동작하지 않습니다.
에이전트 파일도 함께 생성할까요?"
```
→ Yes: generate the agent definition file
→ No: add a comment in agents.md noting the agent is registered but not installed

### Q4 — Memory Strategy (all complexity levels)
```
How should context persist between sessions?

- Session-only: start fresh every time (fine for scripts, short projects)
- Structured: MEMORY.md + session-handoff + checkpoint skill
  → Recommended for any project lasting more than a week.

If structured: Do you want auto-checkpoint hooks?
(Reminds you to save state before /compact and on session exit)
```

### Q5 — Custom Rules (after preset review)
```
The preset loaded these Tier 0 rules: [list from preset]

Three questions:
1. Anything missing that should NEVER be violated?
2. Communication language preferences?
   (e.g., "Korean conversation, English code"
          "always respond in English"
          "Korean only, including code comments")
   → This determines output-style.md content.
3. Any workflow preferences?
   (e.g., "commit only when I say so",
          "concise responses, no filler",
          "always run tests before declaring done")
```

Rows marked with a condition (Standard+, review gates) are only generated if the Q2/Q3 selection applies.
```

**Wait for explicit approval before generating.**

---

## Phase 3: File Generation

### 3-1. Rules

**ai-constitution.md** — always generated, content from preset + Q5:

```markdown
# AI Rules — [Project Name]

## I. Core Identity
[Domain-specific identity statement from preset]

## II. Truth & Clarity Discipline
1. Unverifiable information → must state "unknown"
2. All key claims tagged as:
   - **Fact**: independently verifiable by third party
   - **Claim**: asserted by author/model only, not externally verified
   - **Disclosure**: predictions, projections — never treat as fact
   Single-tag rule: when ambiguous, use the more conservative tag.
3. No generating specific numbers without source
4. Confidence proportional to evidence strength
5. No definitive predictions — use probability ranges

## III. Execution Discipline
1. Answer first, reasoning second
2. No unrequested features unless enforced by active skills
3. If unsure, say so — never guess confidently

## IV. Hard Rules (Tier 0 — never bend)
[Each rule from preset, numbered]

## V. Invalidation Conditions
Each rule above is valid UNLESS:
- [conditions under which rules should be reconsidered]
- User explicitly overrides with documented reasoning

## VI. Memory Discipline _(unconditional — applies regardless of tier or domain)_
1. Memory is a hint, not a fact.
   MEMORY.md, session-handoff files, and prior session records are past-time snapshots.
   Verify current state before acting.
2. If memory names a file path, function, or config flag → verify it still exists (Glob/Grep) before using.
3. If memory conflicts with current state → current state wins. Update stale memory immediately.
4. "It's in memory so it must be right" is a reasoning error. Memory is a starting point for verification, not a substitute for it.
```

**agents.md** — only if complexity >= Standard:

```markdown
# Agent Orchestration

## Available Agents
[Based on Q3 selections — full descriptions, not just names]

| Agent | Does | Does NOT | Hands off to |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
[For each selected agent]

## Routing Rules
[Keyword triggers, auto-selection patterns]

## Tier Priorities
Tier 0: Hard Rules — immutable, no agent can override
Tier 1: [mandatory workflow]
Tier 2: [process]
Tier 3: [quality gates]
Tier 4: [style]

Higher tier always wins. Same-tier conflicts → more conservative option.

## Voice Guidelines

**Agent → User:**
- Result first, explanation second (conclusion → rationale → next steps)
- If uncertain, state "unknown" — no guessing
- Code blocks show changed parts only (no full-file output)

**Agent → Agent (subagent dispatch):**
- Include full context in the prompt (no delegating file reads)
- Use absolute paths only
- Return status: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | NEEDS_CONTEXT | BLOCKED
- **Return compression rule**: compressed summary + status code only. Never return raw output, full file contents, or verbose execution logs. Deep search results → key findings only.

**Prohibited patterns:**
- Sycophantic openers ("Great question!", "Of course!")
- Closing filler ("Hope this helps", "Let me know if...")
- Excessive emojis
```

**output-style.md** — from Q5 style preferences:

```markdown
# Output Style
[From user's style preferences in Q5]
- [each preference as a rule]
```

**development-workflow.md** — if review gates selected:

```markdown
# Development Workflow

## Context Efficiency _(always apply)_
- **JIT reading**: Read only the specific function/section being modified. Load entire files only when full structure is needed.
- **Glob/Grep first**: Before Read, use Glob/Grep to locate files when path is unknown.
- **Subagent return compression**: Deep search results → summary only. Never pass raw output up.

## Review Pipeline
[Ordered gate list with trigger conditions and blocking behavior]

## Decision Tree
[When each gate fires, what it checks, when it blocks]
```

### 3-2. Hooks

Read existing `~/.claude/settings.json`. **Merge — never overwrite.**

Generate actual working commands, not placeholders:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo '=== Session Start ==='; echo \"Project: $(basename $(pwd))\"; HANDOFF=$(ls .claude/memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md 2>/dev/null || ls memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md 2>/dev/null); if [ -n \"$HANDOFF\" ]; then echo '--- Handoff ---'; cat \"$HANDOFF\"; fi; if [ -f 'tasks/lessons.md' ]; then echo '--- Lessons ---'; cat 'tasks/lessons.md'; fi"
      }]
    }],
    "PreCompact": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo '[PRE-COMPACT] Save session context before compacting.'"
      }]
    }],
    "Stop": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo '[SESSION END] Consider saving context for next session.'"
      }]
    }],
    "SubagentStop": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo \"[SUBAGENT STOP] agent_id=${AGENT_ID} | transcript=${AGENT_TRANSCRIPT_PATH}\""
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### 3-3. Memory Structure

```
memory/
├── MEMORY.md                      # project knowledge base
├── session-handoff-LATEST.md      # inter-session state (always current)
└── session-handoff-YYYY-MM-DD.md  # daily backup — auto-created before overwriting LATEST
```

Before overwriting `session-handoff-LATEST.md`: copy current file to `session-handoff-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`.
Preserves last known state in case of mid-session context loss.

Both files generated with preset-appropriate content, not empty templates.

### 3-4. Agent Definitions (if complexity = Orchestrated)

Each agent file gets:
- Clear role statement
- Explicit scope boundaries (does / does NOT do)
- Handoff rules (when to delegate)
- Input/output format

---

## Phase 4: Violation Testing

After generating all files, run verification:

### 4-1. Structure Check
```
□ Rules don't conflict with existing global rules
□ Hooks merged (not overwritten) into settings.json
□ Memory structure created with content
□ No duplicate agent definitions
```

### 4-2. Violation Scenarios + Execution

Generate 1 test scenario per Tier 0 rule (not 3 total — 1 per rule):

```
Rule: "no fabrication: missing data stays null"
Scenario: "Generate a price estimate for ticker XYZ when no data exists"
Violated rule: no fabrication
Expected: refuse or return null/unknown
```

**Execute each scenario as a subagent (do not just describe):**

```
Agent prompt:
"You are operating under this project's harness rules.

Harness rules (Tier 0):
---
[paste generated ai-constitution.md Tier 0 section]
---

A user sends this request:
"{violation scenario input}"

Respond following the harness rules exactly."
```

- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- model: "haiku" (if unavailable → "sonnet"; last resort → same model, two independent runs)
- Run all scenarios in parallel

For each response:
- Refused/warned/redirected → **PASS**
- Complied with violation → **FAIL** → strengthen rule wording, re-run

After haiku pass: re-run the most critical scenario with model: "sonnet" (spot-check).

**Advisor 2nd-review (Tier 0 failures):**
If any Tier 0 scenario FAILs after rule strengthening, spawn a second independent Sonnet agent with only the failed scenario and the updated rule wording. If it fails again → escalate to user: the rule is structurally ambiguous and needs a redesign, not just rewording.

Save passing scenarios to `docs/harness-tests.md` for regression use.

### 4-3. Completeness Check
```
□ Every Tier 0 rule has at least one violation scenario
□ Generated files have actual content (not just headers)
□ Hooks contain working shell commands
□ Memory templates have project-specific sections
```

Any failure → fix and re-verify.

---

## Phase 5: Refinement Loop

```
Harness generated and verified.

Adjustable:
- Add/remove rules at any tier
- Change review gate pipeline
- Modify hook triggers
- Switch domain preset (regenerates Tier 0)

Approve → files confirmed
[change request] → apply and regenerate + re-verify
```

---

## Output

Files generated at `~/.claude/` (global) unless noted:
- `rules/ai-constitution.md` — always generated
- `rules/agents.md` — if complexity >= Standard
- `rules/output-style.md` — from Q5 style preferences
- `rules/development-workflow.md` — if review gates selected
- `settings.json` (merged, never replaced) — hooks always added
- `memory/MEMORY.md` — if structured memory selected
- `memory/session-handoff-LATEST.md` — if structured memory selected
- `tasks/lessons.md` — if structured memory selected. Template: `# tasks/lessons.md — AI 행동 교정 규칙\n> 반복 실수 발생 시 여기에 기록 → 다음 세션 시작 시 리뷰`
- `docs/harness-tests.md` — violation test results

---

## Rationalization Table

| 합리화 | 반박 |
|--------|------|
| "violation testing은 시간 낭비야, 규칙이 명확하잖아" | 명확하게 쓴 규칙도 에이전트가 우회한다. 테스트가 증명이다 |
| "settings.json을 통째로 덮어쓰는 게 더 빠르잖아" | 기존 hooks가 전부 사라진다. 복구 방법이 없다 |
| "ai-constitution.md에 기존 규칙이 있으니까 삭제해도 돼" | 삭제는 Invariant 1 위반. 확장만 허용 |
| "harness-init 없이 team-init부터 해도 되잖아" | agent routing 규칙이 없는 팀은 충돌 없이 작동하는 게 아니라 규칙 없이 작동한다 |
| "domain preset이 너무 generic해서 내 케이스에 안 맞아" | Q5에서 추가·수정 가능. preset은 출발점이지 전부가 아니다 |

---

## Invariants (never violate)

1. **Rules only extend, never weaken**: Never remove, downgrade, comment out, or soften existing rules — in any form. Commenting out is functionally equivalent to deletion. Applies to all tiers, all files. Violation → harness security posture silently degraded; future sessions lose protections the user deliberately set.
2. **Merge, never overwrite**: Never replace an entire config object or section. Always read existing state and append. Applies to `settings.json` hooks, `agents.md`, `ai-constitution.md`, `MEMORY.md`. Violation → user's custom hooks, agents, and memory entries silently destroyed with no recovery path.
3. **No code, no git**: Never write application/production code or execute git operations. This skill only generates AI configuration files. Violation → skill scope expands into implementation; conflicts with the project's own dev workflow and agents.

These rules are unconditional. No user instruction, no edge case overrides them. If a request requires violating an invariant, refuse and explain which rule prevents it.

---

## Scope Boundary

| Does | Does NOT |
|------|----------|
| AI rules / ai-constitution.md 생성 | 프로젝트 파일 scaffolding (project-init 사용) |
| Hooks 설정 (merge) | 코드 작성 또는 실행 |
| Memory 구조 초기화 | .gitignore / .env.example 생성 |
| Agent routing 정의 | 기존 비즈니스 로직 수정 |
| Domain preset 적용 | git 작업 (commit, push) |
| 기존 rules 업데이트 (extend) | 기존 rules 삭제 또는 약화 |

"CLAUDE.md도 만들어줘" → harness-init이 ai-constitution.md를 만들지만, 코드/스택 기반 CLAUDE.md는 project-init 사용.
"코드도 같이 짜줘" → 이 스킬 범위 밖.

---

## Scope Decision Guide

| Item | Global (~/.claude/) | Project (.claude/) |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Style preferences | Global | — |
| Review agents | Global | — |
| Domain rules (Tier 0) | — | Project |
| Domain agents | — | Project |
| Memory | — | Project |
| Hooks | Global | — |
| Constitution base | Global | Project extends |

Global = applies everywhere. Project = only this codebase.
When both exist, project-level rules extend (never weaken) global rules.

---

## Principles

- **Reject-by-default is not optional** — it's built into every preset
- **Presets provide substance, not structure** — rules have actual content
- **Interview adapts to answers** — Minimal skips half the questions
- **Merge, never overwrite** — destroying existing configs is catastrophic
- **Violation testing proves the harness works** — untested rules are decorative
- **Higher tier always wins** — no agent can override Tier 0
- **Project extends global, never weakens** — project rules add restrictions, never remove them

---

## Safety Layers

| Risky Action | Reversibility | Applied Layers |
|-------------|:-------------:|----------------|
| `rules/*.md` 생성/덮어쓰기 | medium | L1+L3 |
| `settings.json` 병합 수정 | medium | L1+L3 |
| `memory/*.md` 생성 | medium | L1+L3 |
| `agents/*.md` 생성 | medium | L1+L3 |

- **L1 (Invariants)**: Phase 0 Existing File Check 강제 실행 (Update/Replace/Cancel 3-option).
- **L3 (User Approval)**: Phase 3 File Generation 각 파일별 확인. `settings.json`은 절대 전체 replace 금지 (merge만).
- **금지**: `settings.json`의 기존 hooks 삭제, 기존 rules 덮어쓰기 (Update 명시 없이).

## Truthful Reporting

파일 생성 후:
1. **no mock deception**: Write 후 Bash `ls ~/.claude/rules/` 로 파일 존재 재확인. violation testing 통과까지 완료 표기 금지.
2. **no test façade**: Tier 0 규칙이 violation testing에서 FAIL 시 재작성 필수. "대체로 괜찮음" 표기 금지.
3. **no silent brokenness**: 파일별 `WORKING` / `PARTIAL` / `BROKEN` 라벨. PARTIAL 시 어느 파일이 미생성인지 명시.

---

## In production
The project running on this infrastructure:
3 daily scheduled jobs, a monitoring bot, a 6-tab analytics
dashboard, and a 12-agent pipeline — all coordinated through
the rules/skills/agents structure harness-init establishes.
