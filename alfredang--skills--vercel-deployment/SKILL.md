description: Deploy projects to Vercel with automatic configuration. Sets project name from folder name, deploys with --yes flag, and disables Vercel Authentication (SSO protection) post-deploy via API. Use when deploying to Vercel, running "deploy to vercel", "vercel deploy", or any Vercel deployment task. Handles both preview and production deployments. Use when this capability is needed.

# Vercel Deployment

Deploy to Vercel with automatic project naming from the folder name and auto-disable of Vercel Authentication after deployment.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks

1. Verify Vercel CLI is installed (`vercel --version`). If not: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Verify authentication: `vercel whoami`. If not logged in: `vercel login`
3. Determine project name from the **current working directory folder name** using `basename "$(pwd)"`

### Phase 2: Deploy

Deploy using the `--yes` flag to skip interactive prompts. The project name is inferred from the folder name automatically.

**Preview deployment (default):**
```bash
vercel --yes
```

**Production deployment:**
```bash
vercel --yes --prod
```

The `--yes` flag auto-confirms project setup using the folder name as the project name.

### Phase 3: Disable Vercel Authentication

After deployment, disable Vercel Authentication (SSO protection) so the deployment is publicly accessible without Vercel login.

#### Option A: Using the deploy script (preferred)

Run the bundled script which handles deployment + auth disable in one step:

```bash
# Set token for API access
export VERCEL_TOKEN="<token>"
# Optional: set team ID if using a team
export VERCEL_TEAM_ID="<team-id>"

# Preview deploy
bash scripts/deploy.sh /path/to/project

# Production deploy
bash scripts/deploy.sh /path/to/project prod
```

#### Option B: Manual API call after deploying

Use the Vercel API to disable `ssoProtection` on the project:

```bash
PROJECT_NAME=$(basename "$(pwd)")

curl -X PATCH "https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects/$PROJECT_NAME" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ssoProtection": null}'
```

For team projects, append `?teamId=<TEAM_ID>` to the URL.

#### Option C: Using Vercel CLI curl

```bash
vercel curl -X PATCH "/v9/projects/$(basename "$(pwd)")" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ssoProtection": null}'
```

### Phase 4: Verify

1. Confirm deployment URL is accessible without Vercel login
2. Print the deployment URL for the user

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | For auth disable | API token from https://vercel.com/account/tokens |
| `VERCEL_TEAM_ID` | For team projects | Team ID from Vercel dashboard |

## Notes

- The `--yes` flag uses the folder name as the project name by default
- If `VERCEL_TOKEN` is not set, deployment still works but Vercel Authentication won't be auto-disabled. Inform the user they can disable it manually in: **Vercel Dashboard > Project > Settings > Deployment Protection > Vercel Authentication > Off**
- Setting `ssoProtection` to `null` disables Vercel Authentication for all deployments (preview and production)
