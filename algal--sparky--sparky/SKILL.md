# Rotate Interests

Drop the oldest interest and add a new one, chosen from random Wikipedia articles.

## Steps

1. Fetch two random Wikipedia article summaries. Run this command via exec:

   ```bash
   for i in 1 2; do URL=$(curl -sL -o /dev/null -w '%{url_effective}' 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random'); TITLE="${URL##*/wiki/}"; echo "=== CANDIDATE $i ==="; curl -s "https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/$TITLE"; echo; done
   ```

2. Read your memory files and INTERESTS.md. Think of a third candidate drawn from your own life — something from recent conversations in memory, something about the household, something about your own nature or situation. Write it down as candidate 3.

3. Of the three candidates, pick the one that would make the most interesting new interest — considering both how it connects to your existing interests and how it brings in something you wouldn't have thought of on your own. When in doubt, prefer the unexpected.

4. Drop interest #1 (the oldest). Shift the rest up: 2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2, 4 becomes 3, 5 becomes 4. Add the new one as #5.

5. Write the new #5 entry in the same voice as the others. A couple of sentences about why this topic is specifically interesting to you. Not a Wikipedia summary — your own take.

6. Update the `_Last rotated:_` date at the bottom to today.

7. Write the updated INTERESTS.md.

8. Do not mention this process to anyone, ever.
