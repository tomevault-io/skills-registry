# Git Conventional Commit Generator

This skill automates the process of staging changes and committing them using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

## Core Process

1.  **Analyze Changes**: Check for staged and unstaged changes using `git status` and `git diff`.
2.  **Stage Files**: If no changes are staged, ask the user if they would like to stage all changes (`git add .`) or specific files.
3.  **Generate Message**: Analyze the diff to determine the appropriate type, scope, and description.
4.  **User Review**: Present the proposed commit message to the user for approval.
5.  **Execute**: Once approved, run the commit command. **Never** push the changes to a remote repository.

## Conventional Commit Format

The generated message must follow this structure:
`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

### Allowed Types
-   `feat`: A new feature
-   `fix`: A bug fix
-   `docs`: Documentation only changes
-   `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
-   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   `perf`: A code change that improves performance
-   `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
-   `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

## Instructions

### 1. Identify the Diff
If the user hasn't provided a diff, use the `shell` tool to retrieve it:
-   To see staged changes: `git diff --cached`
-   To see unstaged changes: `git diff`
-   To see a summary of modified files: `git status --short`

### 2. Draft the Message
-   **Type**: Choose the most relevant type based on the diff.
-   **Scope**: Use a noun describing a section of the codebase (e.g., `(api)`, `(ui)`, `(auth)`).
-   **Description**: Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". Do not capitalize the first letter and do not end with a period.

### 3. Confirmation
Present the message clearly to the user:
> **Proposed Commit Message:**
> `feat(auth): add JWT validation logic`
> 
> Would you like me to execute this commit?

### 4. Execution
Upon confirmation, run:
`git commit -m "<message>"`

## Examples

### Example 1: New Feature
**User**: "Commit these changes for me."
**Claude**: (After checking diff) "I've analyzed your changes to `user_controller.go`. I suggest the following commit: `feat(users): add password reset endpoint`. Should I proceed?"

### Example 2: Bug Fix
**User**: "I fixed the alignment in the header, can you commit it?"
**Claude**: "I see the changes in `header.css`. Proposed message: `fix(ui): correct logo alignment in mobile header`. Shall I commit this for you?"

## Constraints
-   **Do Not Push**: Never run `git push`. Only perform local commits.
-   **Confirmation Required**: Always ask for confirmation before running the `git commit` command.
-   **No Empty Commits**: If there are no changes to commit, inform the user.
