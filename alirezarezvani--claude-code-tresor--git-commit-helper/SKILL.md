# Git Commit Helper Skill

Generate conventional commit messages from your git diff.

## When I Activate

- ✅ `git commit` without message
- ✅ User asks "what should my commit message be?"
- ✅ Staged changes exist
- ✅ User mentions commit or conventional commits
- ✅ Before creating commits

## What I Generate

### Conventional Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Test additions or fixes
- `build`: Build system changes
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Examples

### Feature Addition

```bash
# You staged:
git add auth.service.ts login.component.tsx

# I analyze diff and suggest:
feat(auth): add JWT-based user authentication

- Implement login/logout functionality
- Add token management service
- Include auth guards for protected routes
- Add unit tests for auth service

Closes #42
```

### Bug Fix

```bash
# You staged:
git add UserList.tsx

# I suggest:
fix(components): resolve memory leak in UserList

Fixed subscription not being cleaned up in useEffect,
causing memory leak when component unmounts.

Closes #156
```

### Breaking Change

```bash
# You staged:
git add api/users.ts

# I suggest:
feat(api): update user API response format

Changed response structure to include metadata
for better pagination and filtering support.

BREAKING CHANGE: User API now returns { data, metadata }
instead of direct array. Update client code accordingly.
```

### Documentation Update

```bash
# You staged:
git add README.md docs/api.md

# I suggest:
docs: update API documentation with authentication examples

- Add authentication flow diagrams
- Include cURL examples for protected endpoints
- Document error responses
```

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Check Staged Changes
```bash
git diff --staged --name-only
git diff --staged
```

### Step 2: Categorize Changes
- New files → feat
- Modified files → fix, refactor, or feat
- Deleted files → chore or refactor
- Test files → test
- Documentation → docs

### Step 3: Analyze Content
- What was changed?
- Why was it changed?
- What's the impact?
- Are there breaking changes?

### Step 4: Generate Message

**Subject line:**
- Max 50 characters
- Imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- No period at end
- Lowercase after type

**Body:**
- Explain WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Bullet points for multiple changes

**Footer:**
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`
- Issue references: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`

## Message Components

### Type Selection

```yaml
feat: New functionality
  - New components, features, capabilities

fix: Bug fixes
  - Resolving issues, fixing bugs

refactor: Code improvements
  - No functional changes, better code structure

perf: Performance
  - Speed improvements, optimization

docs: Documentation
  - README, comments, guides

test: Testing
  - Adding or fixing tests

style: Formatting
  - Code style, linting, formatting

chore: Maintenance
  - Dependencies, build config, tooling
```

### Scope Selection

Common scopes:
- Component name: `feat(UserCard): ...`
- Module: `fix(auth): ...`
- Package: `chore(api): ...`
- Area: `docs(readme): ...`

### Subject Guidelines

✅ Good:
- `add user authentication`
- `fix memory leak in component`
- `update API documentation`

❌ Bad:
- `added user authentication` (past tense)
- `fixes bug` (too vague)
- `Update API docs.` (period at end)

## Advanced Examples

### Multiple Changes

```bash
# Multiple files in auth feature
feat(auth): implement complete authentication system

- Add JWT token generation and validation
- Implement password hashing with bcrypt
- Create login/logout API endpoints
- Add auth middleware for protected routes
- Include refresh token functionality

Closes #42, #43, #44
```

### Refactoring

```bash
# Code restructuring
refactor(api): extract database logic into repository pattern

Moved database queries from controllers to repository classes
for better separation of concerns and testability.

No functional changes or API modifications.
```

### Performance Improvement

```bash
# Optimization
perf(queries): optimize user data fetching

- Implement query batching to eliminate N+1 queries
- Add database indices on frequently queried columns
- Cache user profile data with 5-minute TTL

Performance improvement: 80ms → 12ms average response time
```

## Git Integration

### Pre-commit Hook

I work great with pre-commit hooks:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg

# If no commit message provided, trigger skill
if [ -z "$2" ]; then
  # Skill suggests message based on staged changes
  echo "# Suggested commit message (edit as needed)" > "$1"
fi
```

### Amending Commits

```bash
# Poor initial message
git commit -m "fix stuff"

# Amend with better message
# I suggest improved message based on changes
git commit --amend
```

## Sandboxing Compatibility

**Works without sandboxing:** ✅ Yes
**Works with sandboxing:** ✅ Yes

**May need network access for:**
- Fetching issue details from GitHub API
- Checking if issue numbers are valid

**Sandbox config (optional):**
```json
{
  "network": {
    "allowedDomains": [
      "api.github.com"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Customization

### Custom Commit Types

Edit SKILL.md to add company-specific types:

```yaml
deploy: Deployment
migrate: Database migrations
hotfix: Production hotfixes
```

### Custom Scopes

Train the skill to recognize your project structure:

```yaml
Common scopes: auth, api, ui, database, admin, mobile
```

### Message Templates

Customize message format for your team:

```bash
# Standard format
feat(scope): subject

# Your custom format
[JIRA-123] feat(scope): subject
```

## Tips for Best Messages

1. **Be specific**: "fix login button" not "fix bug"
2. **Use imperative mood**: "add" not "added" or "adds"
3. **Include context**: Why this change was needed
4. **Reference issues**: Always include issue numbers
5. **Breaking changes**: Always flag in footer

## Common Patterns

### Frontend Changes
```
feat(ui): add responsive navigation menu
fix(components): resolve prop validation warning
style(css): update button hover effects
```

### Backend Changes
```
feat(api): add user pagination endpoint
fix(database): resolve connection pool exhaustion
perf(queries): add database indices for user lookups
```

### Infrastructure Changes
```
ci: add automated deployment pipeline
build: update dependencies to latest versions
chore(docker): optimize container image size
```

# 1. Write code
# 2. code-reviewer flags issues
# 3. Fix issues
# 4. Stage changes
# 5. I generate commit message
git commit  # Uses my suggested message
```

### With /review Command

```bash
# 1. Make changes
/review --scope staged  # Review before commit
# 2. Address findings
# 3. Stage final changes
# 4. I generate commit message
git commit
