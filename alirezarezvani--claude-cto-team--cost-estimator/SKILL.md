# Cost Estimator

Provides frameworks for estimating infrastructure costs, development effort, and total cost of ownership (TCO) for technical projects.

## When to Use

- Planning infrastructure budgets
- Evaluating build vs. buy decisions
- Projecting costs at different scale points
- Comparing technology options by cost
- Creating business cases for technical investments

## Cost Categories

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

```
TCO = Infrastructure + Development + Operations + Opportunity Cost

## Development Cost Estimation

### Engineering Cost Framework

```
Development Cost = (Hours × Hourly Rate) × Complexity Factor × Risk Buffer

Hourly Rate (Fully Loaded):
- Junior Engineer: $75-100/hr
- Mid-level Engineer: $100-150/hr
- Senior Engineer: $150-200/hr
- Staff/Principal: $200-300/hr

Complexity Factors:
- Greenfield, known tech: 1.0x
- Existing codebase, known tech: 1.2x
- New technology for team: 1.5x
- Complex integrations: 1.3x
- Regulatory/compliance: 1.4x

Risk Buffer:
- Well-defined requirements: 1.2x
- Ambiguous requirements: 1.5x
- Experimental/R&D: 2.0x
```

### Story Point to Cost Mapping

| Size | Story Points | Hours | Cost (Mid-level) |
|------|-------------|-------|------------------|
| XS | 1 | 2-4 | $200-400 |
| S | 2 | 4-8 | $400-800 |
| M | 3 | 8-16 | $800-1,600 |
| L | 5 | 16-32 | $1,600-3,200 |
| XL | 8 | 32-64 | $3,200-6,400 |
| XXL | 13+ | 64+ | $6,400+ |

### Team Cost Calculator

```markdown
## Monthly Team Cost

Engineering Team:
- 2 Senior Engineers × $15,000 = $30,000
- 3 Mid-level Engineers × $10,000 = $30,000
- 1 Engineering Manager × $18,000 = $18,000

Overhead (benefits, tools, etc.): 30%
Monthly Burn: ($78,000) × 1.3 = $101,400

Annual Team Cost: ~$1.2M
```
