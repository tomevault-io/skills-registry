## Instructions for Next.js 16 App Router

When assisting with Next.js 16 App Router tasks:

1. **Understand the Structure**: The App Router uses a file-system-based routing in the `app/` directory. Folders represent route segments, and files like `page.tsx` define the UI for that route.

2. **Basic Route Setup**:
   - Create a folder in `app/` for each route segment (e.g., `app/about/` for `/about`).
   - Add a `page.tsx` file exporting a default React component.

3. **Dynamic Routes**:
   - Use brackets for dynamic segments: `app/posts/[id]/page.tsx`.
   - Access params in the component: `export default function Post({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) { ... }`.

4. **Layouts**:
   - Use `layout.tsx` in route groups or root to wrap child routes.
   - Root layout at `app/layout.tsx` must include `<html>` and `<body>`.

5. **Navigation**:
   - Use `Link` from `next/link` for client-side navigation.
   - For programmatic navigation, use `useRouter` from `next/navigation`.

6. **Loading and Error States**:
   - Add `loading.tsx` for suspense boundaries.
   - Add `error.tsx` for error handling.

7. **Route Groups**:
   - Use parentheses for grouping without affecting URL: `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`.

8. **Parallel Routes**:
   - Use slots with `@` prefix: `app/@analytics/page.tsx`.

9. **Best Practices**:
   - Prefer Server Components where possible.
   - Handle data fetching with `fetch` or third-party libraries.
   - Ensure TypeScript types for params and search params.
