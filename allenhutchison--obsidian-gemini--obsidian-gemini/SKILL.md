# Vault Semantic Search

Find vault content by meaning rather than exact keywords using the `vault_semantic_search` tool. This uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to search indexed vault files semantically.

## When to Use Semantic Search

| Use `vault_semantic_search` when...                          | Use keyword tools (`search_vault`) when... |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| The user asks about concepts or topics                       | The user wants an exact filename or string |
| The query is "find notes about..." or "what do I have on..." | The query is "find the file called..."     |
| The user doesn't remember exact words                        | The user knows the exact term to search    |
| You need to discover related content across the vault        | You need to find a specific known file     |
| Keyword search returned poor or no results                   | You know the exact path or filename        |

**Try semantic search first for concept-based queries.** Fall back to keyword tools if semantic search isn't available or returns insufficient results.

## How to Use

Call the `vault_semantic_search` tool with these parameters:

- **`query`** (required) — The search question, topic, or concept. Natural language queries work best.
- **`maxResults`** (optional) — Number of results to return, 1-20. Default is 5. Increase for broad surveys.
- **`folder`** (optional) — Limit results to files within a specific folder path.
- **`tags`** (optional) — Filter results by Obsidian tags. Uses OR logic — any matching tag qualifies.

## Search Strategies

- **Broad discovery** — Use a conceptual query with higher `maxResults` (10-15): `vault_semantic_search("project management methodologies", maxResults=10)`
- **Focused search** — Narrow with `folder` when the user mentions a specific area: `vault_semantic_search("meeting notes about budget", folder="Work/Meetings")`
- **Tag-filtered search** — Use `tags` when the user references tagged content: `vault_semantic_search("design patterns", tags=["programming", "architecture"])`
- **Follow-up reading** — After finding relevant results, use `read_file` on promising matches to get full note content

## Combining with Keyword Search

For comprehensive results, use both search approaches:

1. Start with `vault_semantic_search` for concept-based discovery
2. If results are insufficient, try `search_vault` with specific keywords
3. Use `read_file` on the most relevant results from either approach

## Limitations

- **Requires vault indexing** — Semantic search only works when the user has enabled vault indexing in settings. If it's not available, fall back to keyword tools.
- **File paths may be missing** — The Google API sometimes doesn't return source file paths in results. Excerpts are still useful for answering questions.
- **Only indexed files are searchable** — Files in excluded folders or newly created files that haven't been indexed yet won't appear in results.

## Tips

- Frame queries as natural language questions or topic descriptions for the best semantic matching.
- When the user asks "what do I know about X" or "find everything related to X", this is the ideal tool to use.
- If results mention relevant content but lack file paths, suggest the user check the RAG status modal to verify indexing is complete.
