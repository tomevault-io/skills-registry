## call

Start a sales simulation session.

### Prerequisites

1. At least one product in `.ezagent/database/marketing/products/`
2. At least one customer in `.ezagent/database/marketing/customers/`
3. At least one operator in `.ezagent/database/marketing/operators/`

### Session Setup

1. List available options:
   ```bash
   ls .ezagent/database/marketing/products/
   ls .ezagent/database/marketing/customers/
   ls .ezagent/database/marketing/operators/
   ```

2. Ask user to select:
   - Product to sell
   - Customer persona to engage
   - Sales strategy to use

3. Load selected data:
   ```bash
   cat .ezagent/database/marketing/products/<selected>/info.json
   cat .ezagent/database/marketing/customers/<selected>/info.json
   cat .ezagent/database/marketing/operators/<selected>/info.json
   ```

4. Generate session ID: `session_<timestamp>`

### Role-Play Execution

**You become the customer.** The user is the salesperson.

Instructions:
- Adopt the customer persona completely
- Respond based on persona's communication style
- Raise objections naturally per persona profile
- React to SPIN questions appropriately
- If well-engaged, show increasing interest
- If poorly handled, become more resistant

**Session markers**:
- Start: "--- Sales Call Started ---"
- User can say "end call" or "exit" to finish

### Post-Call Review

After the call ends:

1. Analyze the conversation for:
   - **spin_usage**: How well were SPIN questions used?
   - **objection_handling**: How were objections addressed?
   - **rapport_building**: Was trust established?
   - **product_presentation**: Was the product positioned well?
   - **closing_attempt**: Was there a clear next step?
   - **strengths**: What went well
   - **improvements**: What to work on
   - **score**: Overall score 1-10

2. Save the review:
   ```bash
   uv run scripts/save_session.py \
     --session-id <session_id> \
     --product <product_name> \
     --customer <customer_name> \
     --operator <strategy_name> \
     --review '<json_review>'
   ```

3. Present the review to the user with actionable feedback.
