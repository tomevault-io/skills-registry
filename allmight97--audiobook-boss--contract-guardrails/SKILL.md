# Contract Guardrails

Use this skill when touching Tauri commands/events or TS client boundary contracts.

## Required Workflow

1. Keep these version sources synchronized only during explicit release work:
- `package.json`
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
2. For command/event or payload changes, verify contract parity:
```bash
scripts/checks.sh standard
```
3. For release-critical merges, run strict binding drift checks:
```bash
bun run bindings:check
# or
CHECK_BINDINGS_STRICT=1 scripts/checks.sh standard
```

## Command Pointers

- IPC contract registration: `src-tauri/src/ipc_contract.rs`
- TS runtime adapter boundary: `src/lib/tauri/client.ts`
- Binding drift guard: `scripts/check-generated-bindings.sh`

## Done Criteria

- Rust commands/events compile and remain registered.
- Generated TS bindings match Rust contract.
- Standard checks pass for non-doc changes.

## Alignment

- Use root AGENTS precedence.
- No implicit internal legacy assumptions.
- Fallback behavior requires explicit trigger/evidence/sunset and fallback-policy compliance.
