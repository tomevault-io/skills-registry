# Tauri Command Conventions

Use this skill when adding or changing Tauri commands, command payloads, or event wiring.

## Preferred Path

1. Define command in `src-tauri/src/commands/*.rs` with `#[tauri::command]`.
2. Validate inputs at command boundary and return `crate::errors::Result<T>`.
3. Register command/event in `src-tauri/src/ipc_contract.rs`.
4. Route frontend command/event usage through `src/lib/tauri/client.ts`.
5. Regenerate/check bindings and run standard checks.

## Command Skeleton

```rust
use crate::errors::{AppError, Result};

#[tauri::command]
pub async fn my_command(payload: MyPayload) -> Result<MyResult> {
    if payload.input.is_empty() {
        return Err(AppError::InvalidInput("input is required".into()));
    }
    Ok(MyResult::default())
}
```

## Hard Invariants

- Command and event contracts remain registered in `ipc_contract::builder()`.
- TS/Rust contract parity is verified via generated bindings.
- Progress-stage authority is not duplicated here; use `job-registry-and-progress` skill + `src/types/events.ts` as canonical source.

## Verification

```bash
scripts/checks.sh standard
# release-critical contract checks
bun run bindings:check
```

## Pointers

- `src-tauri/src/ipc_contract.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/errors.rs`
- `src/lib/tauri/client.ts`
- `src/lib/generated/tauri.ts`
- `scripts/check-generated-bindings.sh`

## Done Criteria

- Command compiles, is registered, and callable from TS boundary adapter.
- Errors map to stable `AppError` variants.
- Contract checks are green for non-doc changes.

## Alignment

- Use root AGENTS precedence.
- No implicit internal legacy assumptions.
- Fallback behavior requires explicit trigger/evidence/sunset and fallback-policy compliance.
- For external API uncertainty, invoke `lib-research`.
