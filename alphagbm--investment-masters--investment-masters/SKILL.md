## 5 Common Principles

Despite radically different styles, all 15 masters converge on these:

### 1. Systems Over Intuition
Dalio built the All-weather system. Simons built quantitative models. AQR built factor frameworks. **The best investors don't rely on gut feeling -- they build repeatable systems.**

### 2. Risk Management Over Stock Picking
- Dalio: "Diversification is the holy grail of investing"
- Marks: "Risk management is not about avoiding risk, but understanding it"
- Tepper: Bets big in extremes, stays conservative otherwise
- **No one survives long-term without disciplined risk control.**

### 3. Clear Thesis + Willingness to Be Wrong
- Ackman: Every position has a clear thesis and exit criteria
- Buffett: "If you can't explain why you bought it simply, you shouldn't buy it"
- Soros: "Invest first, investigate after" -- but exits immediately when wrong
- **Know why you own it. Exit when the thesis breaks.**

### 4. Cycle Awareness
- Marks' pendulum theory
- Dalio's economic quadrants
- Tepper's panic buying
- **Markets perpetually swing between excess optimism and excess pessimism.**

### 5. Long-term > Short-term
- Buffett: "My favorite holding period is forever"
- Zhang Lei: "Long-termism isn't long-term holding, it's long-term value creation"
- Exception: Renaissance profits from short-term statistical arbitrage
- **Choose your time frame and stick to it.**
