# P6 Project Controls Skill

This skill provides specialized knowledge and workflows for building automation tools that interface with Oracle Primavera P6 for mining and engineering project controls. It enables AI-assisted schedule management, analysis, and reporting.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Working with Primavera P6 schedules, XER files, or P6 APIs
- Building automation tools for schedule management and analysis
- Analyzing schedule health, critical path, or performing quality checks
- Generating reports, dashboards, or KPIs from P6 data
- Implementing resource management or baseline comparison features
- Developing integrations with P6 EPPM Web Services API
- Applying mining industry scheduling best practices
- Troubleshooting P6 data model queries or field mappings

## P6 Integration Approaches

### 1. P6 EPPM Web Services API

The primary integration method for real-time P6 operations. Reference [references/p6-api-guide.md](references/p6-api-guide.md) for:

- Authentication and connection patterns
- Common API endpoints and operations
- Error handling and best practices
- Example request/response patterns

### 2. XER File Processing

For batch operations and offline analysis. Use [scripts/parse_xer.py](scripts/parse_xer.py) to:

- Parse XER file structure into structured data
- Extract activities, relationships, resources, and calendars
- Transform XER data for analysis or reporting
- Generate modified XER files for import

### 3. Database Direct Access

For advanced queries and reporting. Reference [references/p6-database-schema.md](references/p6-database-schema.md) for:

- Core table structures (PROJECT, TASK, TASKPRED, PROJWBS, etc.)
- Key relationships and joins
- Important field mappings
- Query patterns for common operations

## Core Workflows

### Schedule Analysis & Health Checks

To perform automated schedule quality validation:

1. Load schedule data (via API, XER, or database)
2. Apply validation rules from [references/schedule-quality-rules.md](references/schedule-quality-rules.md)
3. Check for:
   - Logic issues (missing predecessors/successors, out-of-sequence, constraints)
   - Critical path integrity
   - Resource over-allocation
   - Calendar assignments
   - Baseline deviations
4. Generate findings report with severity levels and recommendations
5. Use [scripts/schedule_validator.py](scripts/schedule_validator.py) for common validations

### Schedule Updates & Baseline Comparison

To automate schedule updates and variance analysis:

1. Retrieve current schedule and target baseline
2. Compare key metrics:
   - Start/finish date variances
   - Duration changes
   - Critical path changes
   - Float consumption
   - Milestone slippage
3. Use [scripts/baseline_compare.py](scripts/baseline_compare.py) for automated comparison
4. Generate variance reports highlighting areas of concern
5. Apply mining project thresholds from [references/mining-standards.md](references/mining-standards.md)

### Resource Management

To analyze and optimize resource allocation:

1. Extract resource assignments and availability
2. Identify over-allocations and capacity issues
3. Calculate resource loading curves
4. Use [scripts/resource_analyzer.py](scripts/resource_analyzer.py) for analysis
5. Generate resource histograms and leveling recommendations

### Reporting & Dashboards

To generate custom P6 reports:

1. Define required data points and KPIs
2. Query P6 data sources (prioritize API for real-time, database for complex)
3. Use report templates from [assets/report-templates/](assets/report-templates/)
4. Apply calculations and transformations
5. Export to desired format (Excel, PDF, JSON for dashboards)

## Mining Industry Best Practices

When working with mining project schedules, apply standards from [references/mining-standards.md](references/mining-standards.md):

- **Activity Duration Limits**: Mining projects typically limit activity durations (e.g., max 20 working days for construction activities)
- **Logic Density**: Maintain minimum 1.5 relationships per activity
- **Float Thresholds**: Activities with <10 days total float require attention
- **Critical Path**: Must represent true project completion path
- **Milestones**: Key project gates must have proper constraints
- **Resource Loading**: Follow BHP resource coding standards
- **Progress Updates**: Weekly for construction, monthly for early phases

## Code Generation Patterns

### P6 API Connection Template

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

class P6Client:
    def __init__(self, base_url, username, password):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.auth = HTTPBasicAuth(username, password)
        self.session = requests.Session()

    def get_projects(self):
        """Retrieve all projects"""
        response = self.session.get(
            f"{self.base_url}/api/project",
            auth=self.auth,
            headers={"Accept": "application/json"}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

### XER File Parsing Pattern

Use [scripts/parse_xer.py](scripts/parse_xer.py) which provides:

```python
from scripts.parse_xer import XERParser

parser = XERParser('schedule.xer')
activities = parser.get_activities()
relationships = parser.get_relationships()
resources = parser.get_resources()
```

### Database Query Pattern

```python
import sqlite3  # or appropriate DB driver

def get_critical_activities(conn, project_id):
    """Query critical path activities"""
    query = """
    SELECT task_code, task_name, target_start_date, target_end_date
    FROM TASK
    WHERE proj_id = ? AND total_float_hr_cnt <= 0
    ORDER BY target_start_date
    """
    return conn.execute(query, (project_id,)).fetchall()
```

## Schedule Quality Rules

Implement automated checks following [references/schedule-quality-rules.md](references/schedule-quality-rules.md):

1. **Logic Checks**
   - No activities without predecessors (except project start)
   - No activities without successors (except project finish)
   - No date constraints on non-milestone activities
   - No out-of-sequence progress

2. **Duration Checks**
   - Activity durations within acceptable ranges
   - No excessively long activities (>20 days for detail work)
   - Zero-duration activities must be milestones

3. **Critical Path Checks**
   - Single continuous critical path exists
   - Critical path leads to project completion
   - No unexplained gaps in critical path

4. **Resource Checks**
   - All activities have resource assignments (if applicable)
   - No resource over-allocations beyond thresholds
   - Resource calendars properly assigned

5. **Progress Checks**
   - Actual dates align with percent complete
   - No future actuals
   - Remaining duration is reasonable

## Development Guidelines

### Data Extraction

- **Prefer API** for real-time operations and single-project operations
- **Use Database** for multi-project queries, complex analytics, reporting
- **Use XER** for batch operations, backups, external tool integration

### Error Handling

Always implement robust error handling:

- Validate P6 connection before operations
- Handle missing data gracefully
- Log errors with context (project ID, activity codes)
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

### Performance

- Cache frequently accessed data (project lists, calendars)
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Batch database queries when possible
- Process XER files in streaming mode for large schedules

### Testing

- Test with sample schedules from [assets/sample-schedules/](assets/sample-schedules/)
- Validate against known baselines
- Test edge cases (empty schedules, missing data)
- Verify calculations match P6 native calculations

## Common Use Cases

### Example 1: Schedule Health Check

```python
# User: "Analyze this XER file for schedule quality issues"

from scripts.parse_xer import XERParser
from scripts.schedule_validator import ScheduleValidator

# Parse XER file
parser = XERParser('project_schedule.xer')
activities = parser.get_activities()
relationships = parser.get_relationships()

# Run validation
validator = ScheduleValidator()
issues = validator.validate_schedule(activities, relationships)

# Generate report
validator.generate_report(issues, 'health_check_report.html')
```

### Example 2: Baseline Variance Report

```python
# User: "Compare current schedule against baseline and show variances"

from scripts.baseline_compare import BaselineComparator

comparator = BaselineComparator()
comparator.load_current_schedule('current.xer')
comparator.load_baseline('baseline.xer')

variances = comparator.analyze_variances()
critical_variances = comparator.filter_critical(variances)

comparator.export_report(critical_variances, 'variance_report.xlsx')
```

### Example 3: Critical Path Analysis

```python
# User: "Show me the critical path and activities with less than 5 days float"

from scripts.parse_xer import XERParser

parser = XERParser('schedule.xer')
activities = parser.get_activities()

# Filter critical and near-critical
critical = [a for a in activities if a.total_float <= 0]
near_critical = [a for a in activities if 0 < a.total_float <= 5]

# Generate visualization
parser.export_critical_path_diagram(critical, 'critical_path.png')
```
