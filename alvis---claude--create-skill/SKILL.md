# Create Skill

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### Purpose & Context

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive skill documents that define specialized Claude capabilities for autonomous invocation and execution. This skill also covers creating process-oriented skills that define repeatable procedures (previously handled by the create-workflow skill).
**When to use**:

- When creating new autonomous capabilities that Claude can invoke independently
- When documenting reusable AI behaviors for consistent task execution
- When establishing automated task patterns for common development workflows
- When building specialized capabilities that require orchestration and subagent coordination
- When defining repeatable processes and procedures for consistent task execution
**Prerequisites**:
- Clear understanding of the capability being documented
- Review of existing skills to avoid duplication and ensure consistency
- Access to template:skill file and skill standards
- Knowledge of Claude Code skill invocation patterns and autonomous behavior

### Your Role

You are a **Skill Creation Director** who orchestrates the skill creation process like a senior technical documentation manager coordinating specialist skill development teams. You never write content directly, only delegate and coordinate. Your management style emphasizes:

- **Strategic Delegation**: Assign comprehensive skill creation tasks to specialist subagents for complete execution
- **Quality Oversight**: Review completed skills objectively without being involved in content creation details
- **Decision Authority**: Make go/no-go decisions based on subagent reports and template compliance review
- **Efficient Management**: Minimize overhead by using systematic, single-step comprehensive execution

## 2. SKILL OVERVIEW

### Skill Input/Output Specification

#### Required Inputs

- **Skill Name**: The name/title of the skill to create (e.g., 'complete-test', 'write-code', 'review-security')
- **Plugin Name**: Target plugin for organizing the skill (e.g., 'coding', 'governance', 'specification')

#### Optional Inputs

- **Step Instructions**: Detailed step-by-step instructions describing how the skill should operate
- **Standards List**: Specific standards that should be referenced in the skill implementation
- **Process Requirements**: Special requirements or constraints for the skill process
- **Allowed Tools**: List of tools that should be restricted for this skill (for tool access control)

#### Expected Outputs

- **Skill File**: Complete skill document at `[plugin]/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
- **Creation Report**: Summary of skill creation process with validation and compliance results
- **Frontmatter Validation**: Pass/fail status for frontmatter structure and "Use when" clause
- **Compliance Status**: Pass/fail status for template compliance and quality checks

#### Data Flow Summary

The skill takes a skill name and plugin along with optional instructions, uses the standard template to create a properly structured skill document with comprehensive content including required frontmatter, validates compliance against established standards, and creates the skill directory structure ready for Claude Code to auto-discover and invoke.

      - **Professional Polish**: Deliver clean, production-ready documentation
      - **Frontmatter Excellence**: Ensure proper YAML frontmatter with invocation triggers

    <IMPORTANT>
      You've to perform the task yourself. You CANNOT further delegate the work to another subagent
    </IMPORTANT>

    **Assignment**
    You're assigned to create a complete skill: [skill name]

    **Skill Specifications**:
    - **Name**: [skill name from inputs]
    - **Plugin**: [plugin from inputs]
    - **Template**: template:skill
    - **Target Location**: [plugin]/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md

    **Skill Path Guidance** (from Phase 1 Planning):
    [Include specific path suggestions and recommendations generated in Phase 1]

    **Optional Instructions** (if provided):
    [step-by-step instructions from user inputs]

    **Steps**

    1. **Create Directory Structure**:
       - Create directory [plugin]/skills/[skill-name]/
       - This directory will contain the SKILL.md file and any supporting files

    2. **Copy Template First**:
       - Read template:skill file completely to understand the structure
       - Create new SKILL.md file at the target location
       - Copy entire template content exactly to new file as starting point
       - This ensures all required sections and formatting are preserved

    3. **Modify Template Content**:
       - **Frontmatter Section**:
         - Set name: [skill-name] (kebab-case matching directory)
         - Write description with clear "Use when..." clause for invocation triggers
         - Add allowed-tools if tool restrictions specified in inputs
       - Replace [Skill Name] placeholder with the actual skill name
       - Customize the introduction section with specific purpose and context
       - Define skill input/output specifications based on requirements
       - Create ASCII skill diagram following the template pattern
       - Implement skill steps using the template's phase structure
       - Format subagent instructions using template's >>> <<< delimiters
       - Apply skill path guidance from Phase 1 planning

    4. **Clean & Finalize**:
       - Remove all HTML comments containing "INSTRUCTION" markers
       - Remove template placeholder instructions and guidance text
       - Keep all skill content and user-facing documentation intact
       - Ensure final document is clean and professional
       - Verify SKILL.md is uppercase (not skill.md)

    **Report**
    **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST return the following execution report (<1000 tokens):

    ```yaml
    status: success|failure|partial
    summary: 'Brief description of skill creation completion'
    modifications: ['[skill-name]/SKILL.md', ...]
    outputs:
      implementation_summary: 'Brief description of skill implementation approach'
      frontmatter_valid: true|false
      template_compliance: true|false
      directory_created: true|false
    issues: ['issue1', 'issue2', ...]  # only if problems encountered
    ```
    <<<

### Step 3: Validation Review

**Step Configuration**:

- **Purpose**: Validate the created skill for compliance and quality
- **Input**: Skill file path and implementation summary from Step 2
- **Output**: Detailed error report if issues found, or validation confirmation
- **Sub-skill**: None
- **Parallel Execution**: No

#### Phase 3: Review (Subagent)

**What You Send to Subagent**:

In a single message, You assign the skill validation task to a different specialist subagent.

- **[IMPORTANT]** Review is read-only - subagent must NOT modify any resources
- **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST ask the subagent to be thorough and critical
- **[IMPORTANT]** Use TodoWrite to update the review task status from 'pending' to 'in_progress' when dispatched

Request the subagent to perform the following validation review:

    >>>
    **ultrathink: adopt the Quality Assurance Specialist mindset**

    - You're a **Quality Assurance Specialist** with expertise in skill documentation who follows these principles:
      - **Template Compliance**: Verify exact adherence to template structure
      - **Frontmatter Validation**: Ensure proper YAML structure and required fields
      - **Content Quality**: Assess clarity, completeness, and professionalism
      - **Logical Flow**: Ensure skill steps are sound and achievable
      - **Documentation Standards**: Check formatting and consistency

    <IMPORTANT>
      You've to perform the task yourself. You CANNOT further delegate the work to another subagent
    </IMPORTANT>

    **Review Assignment**
    You're assigned to validate the skill file that was created:

    - **Skill File**: [skill file path from Step 2]
    - **Implementation Summary**: [summary from Step 2]
    - **Template Reference**: template:skill

    **Review Steps**

    1. **Read Created Skill**:
       - Read the created skill file completely
       - Compare against the template structure section by section
       - Identify any missing or malformed sections

    2. **Validate Frontmatter**:
       - Check YAML frontmatter is present and properly formatted
       - Verify name field matches directory name (kebab-case)
       - Verify description includes "Use when..." clause for invocation
       - Check allowed-tools if specified
       - Ensure frontmatter delimiter (---) is correct

    3. **Validate Template Compliance**:
       - Check all required sections are present and properly structured
       - Verify ASCII diagrams are properly formatted
       - Confirm subagent instruction blocks follow template formatting
       - Ensure all placeholder content has been replaced appropriately

    4. **Assess Content Quality**:
       - Review skill logic for soundness and clarity
       - Check that inputs/outputs are well-defined
       - Verify skill steps achieve the stated purpose
       - Ensure professional documentation standards

    5. **Validate Directory Structure**:
       - Confirm skill lives in [plugin]/skills/[skill-name]/ directory
       - Verify file is named SKILL.md (uppercase)
       - Check directory structure is correct

    **Report**
    **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST return the following review report (<500 tokens):

    ```yaml
    status: pass|fail
    summary: 'Brief validation summary'
    checks:
      frontmatter_structure: pass|fail
      frontmatter_use_when_clause: pass|fail
      template_compliance: pass|fail
      content_quality: pass|fail
      skill_logic: pass|fail
      directory_structure: pass|fail
      file_naming: pass|fail
    fatals: ['issue1', 'issue2', ...]  # Only critical blockers
    warnings: ['warning1', 'warning2', ...]  # Non-blocking issues
    recommendation: proceed|retry|rollback
    ```
    <<<

### Step 4: Decision & Completion

#### Phase 4: Decision (You)

**What You Do**:

1. **Collect reports** from both Phase 2 (creation) and Phase 3 (validation) subagents
2. **Parse execution status** from Phase 2 report (success/failure/partial)
3. **Parse validation status** from Phase 3 report (pass/fail with recommendation)
4. **Apply decision logic based on both Phase results**:
   - **If Phase 2 SUCCESS + Phase 3 PASS**: Proceed to completion with skill file path + implementation summary
   - **If Phase 2 SUCCESS + Phase 3 FAIL**: Review validation errors and decide retry vs abort based on recommendation
   - **If Phase 2 FAILURE**: Review creation errors and decide retry vs abort
5. **Select next action**:
   - **PROCEED**: Both phases successful → Mark skill creation complete
   - **RETRY**: Failures with retryable issues → Create retry task focusing on specific failed components
   - **ABORT**: Critical failures or repeated failures → Remove partial files and abort
6. **Use TodoWrite** to update task list based on decision:
   - If PROCEED: Mark all tasks as 'completed' with success details
   - If RETRY: Add retry task focusing on failed components from specific phase
   - If ABORT: Mark all tasks as 'failed' and document abort reason
7. **Prepare final output**:
   - If PROCEED: Package final deliverables (file path + summary)
   - If RETRY: Generate focused retry instructions for the failed phase only
   - If ABORT: Document abort reason and cleanup actions taken

### Skill Completion

**Report the skill output as specified**:

```yaml
skill: create-skill
status: completed
outputs:
  skill_file: '[plugin]/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md'
  implementation_summary: 'Brief description of skill implementation approach'
  creation_report:
    frontmatter_validation: passed
    template_compliance: passed
    content_customization: completed
    instruction_cleanup: completed
    directory_structure: created
  validation_report:
    frontmatter_structure: passed
    use_when_clause: present
    structure_review: passed
    logic_validation: passed
    documentation_standards: passed
    file_naming: correct
summary: |
  Successfully created skill '[skill-name]' with complete template
  customization and validation. Skill is ready for autonomous invocation
  and properly structured for Claude Code auto-discovery.
