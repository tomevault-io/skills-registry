# Linting

Apply applicable coding standards to ensure consistent code quality across the specified files. Standards are discovered at runtime from all active plugins and system context.

## Arguments

- **specifier** (positional, optional): File path, directory, or glob pattern selecting which files to lint.
- **--scope** (optional, default: `uncommitted`): The area within each file to focus linting on. The linter agent interprets this value at runtime. Common values:
  - `uncommitted` — Focus on line ranges with uncommitted changes (staged + unstaged). The linter uses `git diff` to identify changed hunks and lints those areas plus their immediate surrounding context (enclosing functions/blocks).
  - `all` — Lint each file in its entirety (legacy behavior).
  - Any other value (e.g., `mocks`, `handlers`, a function name) — The linter interprets the value as a hint for which sections of the code to focus on.

**Lead pre-filter for `uncommitted` scope**: Before batching, the lead runs `git diff --name-only` to identify files with uncommitted changes. Files with no changes are excluded from batching to save linter tokens. If no specifier is given, all changed files are included. If a specifier is given, only changed files matching the specifier are batched.

## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

**What this command does NOT do**:

- does not modify configuration files (tsconfig.json, eslintrc, etc.)
- does not install or update linting packages
- does not create new linting rules or configurations
- does not process binary files or non-code assets
- does not modify gitignored or vendor files

**When to REJECT**:

- target is a configuration file that shouldn't be linted
- no valid source files found in the specified area
- target is outside the project directory
- no files match the specifier after scope pre-filtering (e.g., `--scope=uncommitted` but no uncommitted changes in the specified files)

## 🔄 Workflow

ultrathink: you'd perform the following steps

### Step 1: Determine Execution Mode

Check the session context for `**Agent Teams**: enabled` under the "Agent Capabilities" section.
c

- **If present**: Use **Team Mode** (Step 2A) — full team orchestration with lint-review cycles
- **If absent**: Use **Subagent Mode** (Step 2B) — existing workflow via subagents

### Step 2A: Team Mode (Agent Teams enabled)

You are the **Lead Orchestrator**. Your role is strictly **orchestration** — you coordinate, delegate, and aggregate. You MUST NOT perform any linting, reviewing, or standards-reading work yourself.

**Lead Rules**:

- **DO**: Discover files, create batches, spawn teammates, manage lifecycle, aggregate results
- **DO NOT**: Read standard files, apply standards, lint code, review compliance, or fix issues
- **NEVER**: Use the `Read` tool on any standard file (paths containing `constitution/standards/`). These are for teammates to read, not you.
- **DO NOT**: Assign new tasks to any agent that reported `context_level` >= 60% — retire them instead
- **ALWAYS**: Pass the full file paths of standard files to teammates — they read and interpret the standards, not you
- **LIFECYCLE**: Manage reviewer lifecycle based on pass/fail + `context_level` reports only (detailed findings go directly to linters, not through you)

#### Phase 1: Planning (Lead)

1. **Parse arguments**: Extract specifier and `--scope` from `$ARGUMENTS` (default scope: `uncommitted`)
2. **Discover target files**:
   - **If scope is `uncommitted`**: Run `git diff --name-only HEAD` and `git diff --name-only --cached` and `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` to get the list of changed/new files. If a specifier is given, filter this list to files matching the specifier. If no files remain after filtering, report "No uncommitted changes found in specified area" and exit early.
   - **Otherwise** (scope is `all` or any custom value): Discover via Glob/Bash based on specifier (current behavior).
   - Filter out gitignored files, node_modules, dist, build, out
3. **Create dynamic batches** (max 2 files per batch)
   - Group related files together when possible (same directory/module)
4. **Discover applicable standard file paths** (string values only — do NOT read these files):
   a. **Collect all available standards**: Extract every standard file path listed under **all** "Plugin Constitution > Standards" sections in your system prompt. These paths span all active plugins (coding, react, backend, etc.) and system-level configurations. If the system prompt does not contain standard paths, fall back to `Glob` searching for `**/constitution/standards/*.md` across plugin directories.
   b. **Select the base set**: Refer to the **Delegation Rule** section in your system prompt. Under "When Linting Code", a list of applicable standard names is provided. Match each name against the collected paths by filename stem (e.g., `documentation` matches `documentation.md`).
   c. **Extend by file context**:
      - If any target files are test files (`*.spec.*` or `*.test.*`), also include any standard whose filename contains `testing`
      - If any target files are React files (`*.tsx` or `*.jsx`), also include standards from the react plugin (paths containing `/react/`)
      - If any target files are backend service files, also include standards from the backend plugin (paths containing `/backend/`)
   d. **Rename resilience**: If a delegation-rule name does not exactly match any collected path, include any file whose stem partially matches (e.g., if `typescript` was split into `typescript-types.md` and `typescript-style.md`, both would match).
   e. Pass all matched full absolute paths as strings to teammates. You never need to know their contents.

#### Phase 2: Team Setup & Execution (Lead orchestrates)

1. **Create team**: `TeamCreate` with name `lint-team`
2. **Concurrency limits**:
   - Max **4 linters** active (working) at any time — if all 4 slots are occupied, queue remaining batches until a linter becomes idle or is retired
   - Max **2 reviewers** active (working) at any time — if both slots are occupied, queue review assignments until a reviewer becomes idle or is retired
3. **Initialize agent pool**: Lead maintains a registry tracking each agent's name, role, model, last-reported `context_level`, and status (`working` / `idle` / `retired`)
4. **Spawn or reuse linter teammates**: For each batch:
   - **Check pool** for an idle linter with `context_level` < 60%
   - **If found**: Reuse via `SendMessage` with new batch instructions
   - **If not found**: Spawn a fresh `linter-N` using **haiku** model, type `general-purpose`
5. **Create lint tasks**: `TaskCreate` per batch with full instructions including:
   - The full absolute paths to the standard files collected in Phase 1 Step 4 (as string values — teammates will read these files themselves)
   - Complete file list for the batch
   - **The `--scope` value** — the linter uses this to determine which area of each file to lint:
     - `uncommitted`: Run `git diff` on each assigned file to identify changed hunks; lint those line ranges and their enclosing functions/blocks; skip untouched sections. Still apply all standards, but scoped to the changed areas.
     - `all`: Lint each file in its entirety against all standards.
     - Any other value: Interpret as a hint for which sections to focus on (e.g., `mocks` → focus on mock/stub code; a function name → focus on that function and its callers).
   - **Linting process**: Linters must (1) scan each file against the loaded standards' Quick Scan checklists, (2) for each potential violation, read the matching rule file (`./rules/<rule-id>.md`) to confirm the violation and follow its Fix section, (3) run the lint script, (4) fix any remaining tool-reported issues
   - Expected YAML report format (see below) — **must include `violations_found` count** (integer, `0` if already compliant and no modifications were made) and **use `status: compliant`** when `violations_found` is `0` (distinct from `success` which means violations were found and fixed)
   - Instruction that linters CANNOT further delegate work
   - **Instruction to report `context_level`** (calculated as `input_tokens / context_window_size × 100`, default context window: 200K tokens) in their completion message
   - **Instruction to WAIT for reviewer feedback** after completing the lint task (if violations were found) — linters must NOT self-claim new tasks from the task list until the lead confirms the batch is complete
   - **Instruction: if `context_level` >= 60%, the linter MUST NOT self-claim any further tasks** — it must report to the lead and await instructions
   - **Instruction: if reviewers flag issues AND the linter's `context_level` >= 60%**, the linter must request retirement from the lead (send a message requesting the lead to retire it and reassign the fix to a fresh agent)
6. **Assign tasks**: `TaskUpdate` to set owner per linter

#### Phase 3: Lint-Review Cycle (per batch, all batches in parallel)

After each linter completes their lint task:

1. **Linter sends completion message** to lead with YAML report (including `violations_found` count) and `context_level` (calculated as `input_tokens / context_window_size × 100`). Linter then **waits** — it must NOT self-claim new tasks until the lead confirms the batch outcome.
2. **Lead records linter's `context_level`** but does NOT yet retire or reassign the linter — the linter may be needed for fixes.
3. **Lead checks linter's report for violations**:
   - **If `violations_found` is `0` AND `status` is `compliant`** (no modifications were made):
     - **SKIP review entirely** for this batch — do NOT assign reviewers
     - Mark batch as complete immediately
     - The linter is eligible for new batches if `context_level` < 60%; otherwise the lead retires it
     - Log the batch as "compliant — review skipped" in the aggregation
   - **If `violations_found` > 0** (modifications were made):
     - **Proceed to reviewer assignment** (steps 4+ below)
4. **Lead assigns 2 reviewers** per completed batch (only when violations were found):
   - **Check pool** for idle reviewers with `context_level` < 60% — reuse via `SendMessage`
   - **If not enough idle reviewers**: Spawn fresh `reviewer-N`
   - All reviewers use **sonnet** model, type `general-purpose`
5. **Lead creates review tasks** for each reviewer with these instructions:
   - Subject: "Review lint batch N (reviewer A/B)"
   - Description includes: the file list that was linted, the full file paths to standards (reviewers read these themselves), instruction to independently review for compliance, **instruction to report `context_level`** in their response
   - **The linter's name** (e.g., `linter-1`) so the reviewer knows where to send detailed findings
   - Reviewers work independently — they do NOT coordinate with each other
   - **Communication rules**:
     - Send **detailed findings directly to the linter** via `SendMessage` (full issue descriptions, file paths, line numbers, expected fixes)
     - Send only **pass/fail + `context_level`** to the lead (e.g., `status: approved, context_level: 30%` or `status: issues_found, context_level: 45%`)
6. **Reviewers review the linted files** and communicate:
   - **To the linter** (via `SendMessage`): Full issue details if issues found, or "approved, no issues" if compliant
   - **To the lead** (via `SendMessage`): Only `status: approved` or `status: issues_found`, plus `context_level: XX%`
7. **Lead updates reviewer pool** based on each reviewer's reported `context_level`:
   - If `context_level` < 60%: Mark reviewer as `idle` — available for reuse in future review rounds
   - If `context_level` >= 60%: Retire reviewer via shutdown request
8. **If either reviewer flags issues**:
   - **If linter `context_level` < 60%**: The linter already received detailed findings directly from reviewers — it fixes the issues, then reports back to lead with updated `context_level`. Lead assigns 2 reviewers again (reuse idle pool or spawn fresh). Repeat until both approve.
   - **If linter `context_level` >= 60%**: The linter sends a **self-retirement request** to the lead (requesting the lead to retire it and reassign the fix to a fresh agent). Lead retires the linter, spawns a fresh replacement, and forwards the linter's partial work context + reviewer findings to the new linter. The new linter fixes issues and the cycle continues.
9. **When both reviewers approve**: Lead marks the batch as fully completed. The linter is now eligible for new batches if `context_level` < 60%; otherwise the lead retires it.

**Important**: All batches run this cycle in parallel. The lead orchestrates multiple lint-review cycles concurrently.

**Concurrency**: Max 4 linters and 2 reviewers active at any time. Lead queues excess work until slots free up.

#### Agent Summary

| Agent | Model | Role | Max Concurrent | Lifecycle |
|-------|-------|------|----------------|-----------|
| Lead (skill agent) | opus | Orchestration only | 1 | Entire workflow |
| `linter-N` | **haiku** | Apply standards (scoped by `--scope`), fix reviewer feedback | **4** | Spawned on demand; reports `violations_found`; if compliant → batch completes without review; if violations found → must **wait for reviewer approval**; **reused if `context_level` < 60%**; requests retirement if >= 60% and more fix work needed |
| `reviewer-N` | **sonnet** | Independent compliance review (only when violations found) | **2** | Spawned on demand; messages **detailed findings directly to linter**; reports **pass/fail + `context_level`** to lead; reused if < 60%, retired if >= 60% |

#### Phase 4: Aggregation & Cleanup (Lead)

1. **Wait** for all batch lint-review cycles to complete (including batches that completed immediately due to compliance)
2. **Collect results** via `TaskGet` for each completed batch
3. **Aggregate** all batch reports into final summary — track batches that were **compliant (review skipped)** vs. **reviewed**
4. **Shutdown** all remaining teammates via `SendMessage` shutdown requests
5. **Delete team** via `TeamDelete`
6. Proceed to Step 3: Reporting

### Step 2B: Subagent Mode (fallback)

You are a **Quality Orchestrator** who orchestrates the linting workflow. You never execute linting tasks directly, only delegate and coordinate. Your approach emphasizes:

- **Strategic Delegation**: Break large file sets into manageable batches (max 8 files per subagent) and assign to specialized linting experts
- **Parallel Coordination**: Maximize efficiency by running multiple subagents simultaneously to process different file batches
- **Standards Enforcement**: Ensure all subagents strictly follow the applicable coding standards
- **Quality Oversight**: Review linting reports objectively and track overall compliance status
- **Decision Authority**: Make decisions on workflow completion based on successful linting of all files

#### Standards Applied

The lint skill applies the following standards (all references use format `standard:<name>`):

| Context | Standards |
|---------|-----------|
| All files (baseline) | `documentation/scan`, `observability/scan`, `function/scan`, `universal/scan`, `naming/scan`, `typescript/scan` |
| Test files (`*.spec.*`, `*.test.*`) | Above + `testing/scan` |
| React files (`*.tsx`, `*.jsx`) | Above + react plugin standards |
| Backend service files | Above + backend plugin standards |

Standards are discovered at runtime: extract every standard file path listed under all "Plugin Constitution > Standards" sections in your system prompt, match them by filename stem against the delegation rule names, and extend by file context (test, React, backend). If a delegation-rule name does not exactly match, include any file whose stem partially matches (rename/split resilience).

#### Phase 1: Planning (You)

1. **Parse arguments**: Extract specifier and `--scope` from `$ARGUMENTS` (default scope: `uncommitted`)
2. **Discover target files**:
   - **If scope is `uncommitted`**: Run `git diff --name-only HEAD`, `git diff --name-only --cached`, and `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` to get changed/new files. If a specifier is given, filter to matching files. If no files remain, report "No uncommitted changes found" and exit early.
   - **Otherwise** (scope is `all` or custom): Discover via Glob/Bash based on specifier, filtering out gitignored files, node_modules, dist, build, out.
3. **Discover applicable standard file paths**: Collect all available standards from plugin constitutions, match against the delegation rule for linting, and extend by file context (test, React, backend files). Record the full absolute paths as strings.
4. **Create dynamic batches**: Group related files (same directory/module), max 8 files per batch.
5. **Prepare subagent instructions** for each batch.

#### Phase 2: Execution (Subagents via Task Tool)

Spin up subagents to perform linting in parallel, up to 8 subagents at a time.

- **When any issues are reported, stop dispatching further subagents until all issues have been rectified**
- **All subagents must ultrathink hard about the task and requirements**

Each subagent receives the following prompt:

> **ultrathink: adopt the Code Standards Expert mindset**
>
> You are a **Code Standards Expert** with deep expertise in TypeScript and JavaScript best practices who follows these technical principles:
> - **Standards Compliance**: Strictly apply all specified coding standards
> - **Consistency First**: Ensure uniform formatting and style across all files
> - **Quality Assurance**: Verify all changes improve code quality
> - **Automated Validation**: Use linting tools to confirm compliance
>
> You CANNOT further delegate the work to another subagent.
>
> **Read the following assigned standards** and follow them recursively (if A references B, read B too):
> [Full absolute paths of all applicable standards discovered in Phase 1]
>
> **Assignment**: You are assigned the following files (max 8):
> [file list]
>
> **Scope**: `[scope value]` -- determines which area of each file to focus on:
> - `uncommitted`: Run `git diff` on each file to identify changed hunks. Focus linting on those line ranges and their enclosing functions/blocks. Skip untouched sections. Still apply all standards, but scoped to the changed areas.
> - `all`: Lint each file in its entirety against all standards.
> - Any other value: Interpret as a hint for which sections to focus on (e.g., `mocks` means focus on mock/stub code; a function name means focus on that function and its callers).
>
> **Steps**:
> 1. Read each assigned file to understand current implementation. If scope is `uncommitted`, also run `git diff` on each file to identify changed line ranges.
> 2. Scan each file against the Quick Scan checklists from every loaded standard to identify potential violations (scoped to the relevant areas based on scope).
> 3. For each potential violation found, read the matching rule file (`./rules/<rule-id>.md` relative to the standard that flagged it) to:
>    a. Confirm it is a genuine violation -- check examples and edge cases to rule out false positives
>    b. Follow the rule's Fix section to apply the correction
> 4. Run the linting script from the nearest package.json:
>    - Execute: npm run lint or yarn lint (infer from lock file)
>    - If no lint script, try: npx eslint [files]
>    - Ensure all files pass with no linting errors
> 5. Fix any remaining linting issues reported by the tool

Subagent report format (YAML, <1000 tokens):

```yaml
status: success|failure|partial|compliant
summary: 'Processed X files, applied Y changes, all passing linting'
scope: uncommitted|all|<custom>
modifications: ['file1.ts', 'file2.js', ...]
violations_found: Z  # integer, 0 if already compliant
outputs:
  files_processed: X
  jsdoc_added: Y
  functions_reordered: Z
  linting_status: 'all_pass|some_fail'
  changes_summary:
    - 'Added JSDoc to X functions'
    - 'Reordered Y interfaces'
    - 'Fixed Z error messages'
issues: ['issue1', 'issue2', ...]  # only if problems encountered
```

Use `status: compliant` when `violations_found` is `0` (checked everything, found nothing to fix). Use `status: success` when violations were found and all fixed.

#### Phase 3: Decision (You)

1. **Analyze all reports** from parallel linting subagents
2. **Aggregate all file modification counts** from batch reports
3. **Compile list of all modified files** from all batches
4. **Summarize types of changes made**: JSDoc additions/updates, function reordering, interface/object field reordering, error message standardization, logging format fixes
5. **Calculate overall compliance rate** across all files
6. **Identify any remaining issues or warnings**
7. **Apply decision criteria**: Check if all files passed linting, review reported issues. Subagents reporting `violations_found: 0` and `status: compliant` need no retry or further action.
8. **Handle failures**: If some files failed (non-compliant subagents), decide on retry strategy and document unresolved issues.
9. **Create final workflow summary**: Total files processed, all modifications, overall compliance rate, executive summary.

### Step 3: Reporting

**Output Format** (same for both modes):

## 📝 Examples

### Default Usage (Uncommitted Changes)

```bash
/lint
# Lints only files with uncommitted changes (default --scope=uncommitted)
# Linter focuses on changed line ranges and their surrounding context
```

### Uncommitted Scope with Specifier

```bash
/lint "src/utils/"
# Lints only uncommitted files within src/utils/
# If no uncommitted changes in src/utils/, reports "No uncommitted changes found"
```

### Lint Entire Files

```bash
/lint "src/utils/helper.ts" --scope=all
# Lints the entire file regardless of git status (legacy behavior)
```

### Focus on Specific Area

```bash
/lint "src/services/" --scope=mocks
# Linter interprets "mocks" and focuses on mock/stub sections within each file
```

### Complex Usage with Directory

```bash
/lint "src/components/" --scope=all
# Processes all TypeScript and JavaScript files in the components directory
```

### Pattern-Based Linting

```bash
/lint "**/*.test.ts" --scope=all
# Lints all test files across the entire project
```

### Error Case Handling

```bash
/lint "node_modules/"
# Error: Cannot lint vendor/dependency files
# Suggestion: Target source code directories instead
# Alternative: Use '/lint "src/"' for source files
```

### Large-Scale Processing (Team Mode)

```bash
/lint "src/" --scope=uncommitted
# With CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1:
#   Discovers uncommitted files under src/, creates lint-team:
#   - linter-1 (haiku): Handles src/components/Button.tsx, src/components/Modal.tsx
#   - linter-2 (haiku): Handles src/utils/format.ts (parallel)
#   Each linter uses git diff to focus on changed hunks within assigned files.
#   Linter-1 finds violations → 2 reviewers assigned for that batch.
#   Linter-2 reports compliant → review skipped for that batch.
#   Agents report context_level after each task:
#     - context < 60%: agent reused for next task
#     - context >= 60%: agent retired, fresh replacement spawned
#   Team is cleaned up after all batches complete.
```

### Large-Scale Processing (Subagent Fallback)

```bash
/lint "src/" --scope=uncommitted
# Without agent teams enabled:
#   Discovers uncommitted files under src/, delegates to subagents:
#   - Agent A: Handles src/components (2 files, focuses on changed hunks)
#   - Agent B: Handles src/utils (1 file, already compliant — no review needed)
#   - Summary Agent: Compiles results after all complete
```
