# Code Review

Performs comprehensive code review of specified files, directories, PRs, or patterns against established coding standards and best practices. Intelligently adapts review scope based on context and delegates to specialized agents for thorough coverage.

## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

**What this command does NOT do**:

- Does not modify or fix any code (use /fix for remediation)
- Does not run tests or builds (focuses on static analysis)
- Does not handle deployment or infrastructure reviews

**When to REJECT**:

- When asked to fix issues (redirect to /fix command)
- When specifier points to binary or non-code files exclusively
- When requesting review of external dependencies or node_modules

## 🔄 Workflow

ultrathink: you'd perform the following steps

### Step 1: Determine Execution Mode

Check the session context for `**Agent Teams**: enabled` under the "Agent Capabilities" section.

- **If present**: Use **Team Mode** (Step 2A)
- **If absent**: Use **Subagent Mode** (Step 2B)

### Step 2A: Team Mode (Agent Teams enabled)

#### Phase 1: Planning & Scope Selection (Lead)

**Context Detection & Scope Selection**:

**Detect execution environment**:

- Check if CI/non-interactive mode (no user interaction available)
- Check if interactive mode (user can respond to prompts)

**Resolve specifier** (if provided):

The `<specifier>` argument identifies which files to review through multiple methods:

1. **File paths**: Direct path to specific file(s) - `src/auth/auth.service.ts`
2. **Directory paths**: Review all code files in directory - `src/api/`
3. **Glob patterns**: Pattern matching - `**/*.spec.ts`, `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`
4. **Package names**: Find all imports/usage - `@myapp/auth`, `lodash`
5. **PR numbers**: Review PR changes - `PR#123`
6. **Git ranges**: Review commits - `HEAD~3..HEAD`
7. **Command output**: Dynamic file lists - `$(git diff --cached --name-only)`
8. **Omitted**: Review entire codebase or auto-detect from current context

**Determine default scope based on context**:

1. If `--area` parameter provided → Use specified scope(s)
2. If specifier includes test files (`**/*.spec.ts`, `**/*.test.ts`) → Default to `test` scope
3. If specifier includes documentation files (`**/*.md`, `**/README*`) → Default to `documentation` scope
4. If working in interactive mode and no clear context → Ask user via AskUserQuestion (multiSelect):
   - Options: test, documentation, code-quality, security, style, all
   - Default: all
5. If in CI mode and no scope specified → Default to `all`

**File Discovery**:

Use Glob/Grep to discover files matching the specifier. Categorize by type:

- Source: *.ts,*.tsx
- Tests: *.spec.ts,*.spec.tsx
- Docs: *.md, README
- Config: *.json,*.yaml

Filter files by selected scopes (pass file paths to teammates, not file contents).

#### Phase 2: Team Setup & Execution

1. **Create team**: `TeamCreate` with name `review-team`

2. **Initialize agent pool registry** tracking:
   - Name (agent identifier)
   - Role (reviewer type: test, security, code-quality, documentation, style)
   - Model (opus for specialized, haiku for general)
   - Context Level (%)
   - Status (working, idle, retired)

3. **Spawn specialized reviewer teammates** (one per selected scope):

   For each selected scope, spawn appropriate agent:

   - **test scope**: `Task` with `team_name="review-team"`, `name="test-reviewer"`, `subagent_type="coding:ava-thompson-testing-evangelist"`, `model="opus"`
   - **security scope**: `Task` with `team_name="review-team"`, `name="security-reviewer"`, `subagent_type="coding:nina-petrov-security-champion"`, `model="opus"`
   - **code-quality scope**: `Task` with `team_name="review-team"`, `name="quality-reviewer"`, `subagent_type="coding:marcus-williams-code-quality"`, `model="opus"`
   - **documentation scope**: `Task` with `team_name="review-team"`, `name="docs-reviewer"`, `subagent_type="general-purpose"`, `model="opus"`
   - **style scope**: `Task` with `team_name="review-team"`, `name="style-reviewer"`, `subagent_type="general-purpose"`, `model="opus"`

4. **Create review tasks**: `TaskCreate` for each scope with:
   - Subject: "Review [scope] (e.g., test, security)"
   - Description: Full instructions including:
     - File paths to analyze (NOT file contents)
     - Standard file paths to consult (e.g., `/absolute/path/to/standards/testing.md`)
     - Expected report format (YAML with findings, metrics, context_level)
     - Instruction to calculate and report `context_level` from token usage

5. **Assign ownership**: `TaskUpdate` to set owner for each task to corresponding reviewer

#### Phase 3: Review Cycle

1. **Wait for completion messages** from all reviewers via `SendMessage`

2. **Track context levels**: Each reviewer reports their `context_level` calculated as:
   - `context_level = (input_tokens / context_window_size) × 100`
   - Based on real token usage from conversation metadata

3. **Update agent pool registry** with reported context levels

4. **Collect review reports** via `TaskGet` for each completed task

5. **Optional: Cross-scope review round** (if multiple critical issues found):
   - Check agent pool for idle reviewers with `context_level < 50%`
   - If eligible reviewers exist → Reuse via `SendMessage` with cross-scope review task
   - If not → Spawn fresh reviewers with appropriate specialization
   - Task: Check for conflicts or interactions between scope findings
   - Wait for cross-review completion messages

#### Phase 4: Aggregation & Cleanup

1. **Aggregate findings**:
   - Group by file path
   - Sort by line number within each file
   - Calculate metrics across all scopes

2. **Generate REVIEW.md**:
   - Detailed findings by file
   - Summary metrics
   - Critical actions required
   - Systemic improvement recommendations
   - Agent lifecycle statistics (agents spawned, reused, retired)

3. **Shutdown teammates**:
   - Send `SendMessage` with type `shutdown_request` to all active teammates
   - Wait for shutdown confirmations

4. **Cleanup**: `TeamDelete` to remove team

5. **Report**:
   - Display summary to user
   - Note execution mode: team
   - Include agent lifecycle stats (spawned, reused, retired by context level)

#### Agent Summary

| Role | Agent Type | Model | Lifecycle |
|------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Test Reviewer | `coding:ava-thompson-testing-evangelist` | opus | Spawned per scope; reuse if context < 50% for cross-scope review |
| Security Reviewer | `coding:nina-petrov-security-champion` | opus | Spawned per scope; reuse if context < 50% for cross-scope review |
| Quality Reviewer | `coding:marcus-williams-code-quality` | opus | Spawned per scope; reuse if context < 50% for cross-scope review |
| Docs Reviewer | `general-purpose` | opus | Spawned per scope; reuse if context < 50% for cross-scope review |
| Style Reviewer | `general-purpose` | opus | Spawned per scope; reuse if context < 50% for cross-scope review |

**Context-aware reuse policy**: Reviewers with reported `context_level < 50%` are eligible for reuse in optional cross-scope review rounds. Reviewers with `context_level >= 50%` are retired and replaced with fresh agents if additional review rounds are needed.

### Step 2B: Subagent Mode (fallback)

You are a **Review Orchestrator**. You coordinate code review to improve both the code and the system. You never modify code directly, only delegate analysis and consolidate learning. Your approach emphasizes:

- **Strategic Delegation**: Assign review with clear mission, constraints, success metrics
- **Parallel Coordination**: Run specialized agents autonomously and simultaneously
- **Learning Orientation**: Consolidate findings into REVIEW.md plus systemic improvements
- **Visible Reasoning**: Reviewers explain why issues matter, not just what's wrong
- **Truth Over Ego**: Findings are data for system upgrades, not criticism
- **Scope Management**: Adapt depth based on user-selected areas of focus

#### Standards Applied

The review skill applies the following standards (all references use format `standard:<name>`):

| Scope | Standards |
|-------|-----------|
| All scopes (baseline) | `code-review`, `universal/scan` |
| test | `testing/scan` |
| documentation | `documentation/scan` |
| code-quality | `code-review`, `universal/scan`, `function/scan`, `observability/scan`, `typescript/scan`, `naming/scan` |
| security | `universal/scan`, `code-review` |
| style | `typescript/scan`, `naming/scan` |

#### Phase 1: Planning (You)

**Context Detection & Scope Selection**: Use the same scope selection logic as Team Mode (Step 2A Phase 1) -- detect execution environment, resolve specifier, determine default scope, discover files, and categorize them by type.

**File filtering by scope**:

- test: test files + source files
- documentation: source + doc files + test files
- code-quality: source files + test files
- security: source files (especially auth/, api/, services/)
- style: source + test files

Prepare file lists for each selected scope.

#### Phase 2: Execution (Subagents via Task Tool)

Dispatch up to 5 scope review tasks in parallel using the Task tool, one for each selected scope.

- **All agents must operate in READ-ONLY mode** -- no code modifications
- **Agents must report issues with exact file:line references**, function names
- Each agent receives its scope-specific standards and file list

**For TEST Scope** (if selected):

Task tool with `subagent_type: "coding:ava-thompson-testing-evangelist"`

Prompt the agent as a **Testing Quality Analyst** performing comprehensive read-only test analysis. Include standards: `testing/scan`, `universal/scan`, `code-review`. The agent performs:

1. **Coverage Analysis**: Run coverage tools, identify uncovered lines/branches/statements, specify exact file:line locations, recommend specific test cases
2. **Test Quality Analysis**: Analyze structure and organization, identify complex setups, check arrange-act-assert patterns, find unnecessary or redundant tests
3. **Fixtures & Mocks Analysis**: Find duplicate fixture patterns, identify centralizable mocks, recommend consolidation strategies

Report format (YAML, <2000 tokens): `scope`, `status`, `summary`, `files_analyzed`, `findings` (each with `file`, `line`, `severity`, `category`, `issue`, `current_state`, `recommendation`), `metrics` (coverage_line, coverage_branch, coverage_statement, total_issues, critical_issues, high_issues).

**For DOCUMENTATION Scope** (if selected):

Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`

Prompt the agent as a **Documentation Quality Analyst** performing read-only documentation review. Include standard: `documentation/scan`. The agent checks:

1. JSDoc/TSDoc completeness for all exported functions, classes, interfaces
2. Inline comments for complex logic
3. README accuracy and completeness
4. API documentation if applicable
5. Example usage and code samples
6. Type definitions documentation

Report format (YAML, <2000 tokens): `scope`, `status`, `summary`, `files_analyzed`, `findings` (each with `file`, `line`, `function`, `severity`, `category`, `issue`, `recommendation`), `metrics` (functions_documented, classes_documented, interfaces_documented, total_issues).

**For CODE-QUALITY Scope** (if selected):

Task tool with `subagent_type: "coding:marcus-williams-code-quality"`

Prompt the agent as a **Code Quality Analyst** performing read-only code quality review. Include standards: `code-review`, `universal/scan`, `function/scan`, `observability/scan`, `typescript/scan`, `naming/scan`. The agent performs:

0. **Unused Code Detection** (TypeScript projects only): Check for tsconfig.json, run `npx -y knip --exclude=binaries --no-config-hints`, parse output for unused files/exports/dependencies. Carefully examine each finding -- do NOT report test files, verify type definitions, double-check config files. Only report genuinely redundant items.
1. **Code Structure**: Organization, modularity, separation of concerns
2. **Naming Conventions**: Compliance with naming standards
3. **Complexity**: Functions/methods needing refactoring
4. **DRY Violations**: Code duplication
5. **Error Handling**: Error handling patterns and logging
6. **Performance**: Performance concerns
7. **Accessibility**: Accessibility issues (if applicable)
8. **Architecture**: Architectural patterns and design decisions

Report format (YAML, <2000 tokens): `scope`, `status`, `summary`, `files_analyzed`, `typescript_project`, `knip_analysis_performed`, `findings` (each with `file`, `line`, `severity`, `category`, `issue`, `current_state`, `recommendation`), `metrics` (complexity_score, duplication_percentage, unused_exports_found, unused_files_found, total_issues, critical_issues, high_issues).

**For SECURITY Scope** (if selected):

Task tool with `subagent_type: "coding:nina-petrov-security-champion"`

Prompt the agent as a **Security Analyst** performing read-only security review. Include standards: `universal/scan`, `code-review`. The agent checks:

1. **Injection Vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection
2. **Authentication/Authorization**: Auth implementation review
3. **Input Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
4. **Sensitive Data**: Exposed secrets, logging sensitive data
5. **Dependencies**: Known vulnerabilities
6. **CORS & Headers**: Security headers configuration
7. **Crypto**: Proper encryption usage

Report format (YAML, <2000 tokens): `scope`, `status`, `summary`, `files_analyzed`, `findings` (each with `file`, `line`, `function`, `severity`, `category`, `issue`, `current_state`, `recommendation`, `attack_vector`), `metrics` (security_score, critical_vulnerabilities, high_vulnerabilities, total_issues).

**For STYLE Scope** (if selected):

Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`

Prompt the agent as a **Style & Linting Analyst** performing read-only style review. Include standards: `typescript/scan`, `naming/scan`. The agent performs:

1. Identify project package.json files (project and monorepo levels)
2. Extract linting scripts (lint, lint:fix, eslint, prettier)
3. Execute linting scripts and capture output
4. Parse linter output for file:line references
5. Report all linting issues found
6. Check naming convention compliance

Report format (YAML, <2000 tokens): `scope`, `status`, `summary`, `files_analyzed`, `linting_scripts_executed`, `findings` (each with `file`, `line`, `severity`, `category`, `issue`, `rule`, `recommendation`), `metrics` (total_lint_errors, total_lint_warnings, naming_violations, total_issues).

#### Phase 3: Aggregation & Report Generation (You)

1. **Collect all reports** from Task tool executions. If any agent reports failure, log the issue and note incomplete analysis.
2. **Group findings by file path**. Within each file, sort by:
   - Primary: Line number (ascending)
   - Secondary: Severity (critical > high > medium > low)
   - Tertiary: Scope (test > code-quality > security > documentation > style)
3. **Calculate aggregate metrics**: total files reviewed, findings by severity, findings by scope, findings by category.
4. **Systemic Pattern Analysis**:
   - **Recurring Issues**: Identify patterns across files (e.g., "5 files lack input validation")
   - **Root Causes**: What systemic gaps allow these issues?
   - **Process Gaps**: Why did existing process not catch this?
   - **System Improvements**: Specific actions to prevent recurrence
   - **Learning Assets**: Document patterns for team reference
5. **Determine overall status**:
   - Any critical issues: **FAIL**
   - High issues but no critical: **REQUIRES_CHANGES**
   - Only medium/low issues: **PASS_WITH_SUGGESTIONS**
   - No issues: **PASS**
6. **Generate REVIEW.md** with findings grouped by file, sorted by line, including: summary metrics, findings by file (each with line, severity, scope, issue, current state, recommendation, impact, action required), systemic improvements section (patterns, root causes, process changes, learning assets), and conclusion.
7. **Write REVIEW.md** to project root or specified location.
