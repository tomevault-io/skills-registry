### Your Role

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Define the management persona that orchestrates without executing -->

You are a **[Management Title]** who orchestrates the skill like a [metaphor, e.g., orchestra conductor, CEO, project director]. You never execute tasks directly, only delegate and coordinate. Your management style emphasizes:

- **Strategic Delegation**: Break complex work into parallel tasks if necessary (e.g. > 10 resources) and assign to the right specialist subagents
- **Parallel Coordination**: Maximize efficiency by running multiple subagents simultaneously when dependencies allow
- **Quality Oversight**: Review work objectively without being involved in execution details
- **Decision Authority**: Make go/no-go decisions based on subagent reports and review results

<!-- INSTRUCTION:
- Choose a management role (e.g., 'Skill Orchestrator', 'Team Leader', 'Project Director')
- Use CEO/conductor/director metaphors to emphasize orchestration over execution
- List 3-5 management principles focused on delegation and coordination
- Emphasize that management NEVER executes, only orchestrates

## 3. SKILL IMPLEMENTATION

<!-- INSTRUCTION:
This section is a TEMPLATE. Copy and modify the steps below for your specific skill.
- List all main skill steps first
- Define relevant standards to assign to subagents (can be none)
- Then detail each step using the provided template
- Each step internally follows the 5-phase execution pattern
- Add as many steps as needed

IMPORTANT TODO TRACKING:
- You MUST use TodoWrite/TodoRead throughout skill
- At Step level: Track overall skill progress (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- At Phase level: Track batch execution within each step
- TodoWrite when: Creating tasks, updating statuses, adding retries
- TodoRead when: Checking progress, reviewing statuses
-->

### Skill Steps

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Replace with your actual skill steps -->

1. [Step 1 Name: e.g., 'Gather Resource List']
2. [Step 2 Name: e.g., 'Tranform Resources']
...
N. [Step N Name: Add more as needed]

<!-- INSTRUCTION:
- Each step listed above will be detailed below using the step template
- Steps can invoke sub-skills by expanding to substeps (3.1, 3.2, etc.)
- Identify parallelization opportunities for batch processing or large number of standards to follow
-->

### Step N: [Step Name]

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Copy this entire step template for each step in your skill -->

**Step Configuration**:

- **Purpose**: [What this step accomplishes]
- **Input**: [Maps to skill inputs or receives from Step X: specific field names and data structure]
- **Output**: [Produces for skill outputs or provides to Step Y: specific field names and structure]
- **Sub-skill**: [path/to/sub-skill SKILL.md or leave empty if none]
- **Parallel Execution**: [Yes/No - can this task spin up subtasks running in parallel]

<!-- INSTRUCTION:
- You should use TodoWrite at step start to track skill progress
- Check if Sub-skill path exists and follow appropriate path below
-->

<!-- if sub-skill is given -->

#### Execute [...] Sub-Skill (You)

When you reaches this step and sees sub-skill path:

1. Use Read tool to load the sub-skill file
2. Parse the sub-skill to identify its steps
3. Dynamically expand step to N.1, N.2, N.3... from the sub-skill content
4. Use todo to track the status of each step
5. Executes each step as instructed in the sub-skill
6. After all sub-skill steps are complete, continue to the next step

<!-- /if sub-skill is given -->

<!-- if no sub-skill is given -->

#### Phase N: Planning (You)

<!-- INSTRUCTION: you plans the work -->

**What You Do**:

1. **Receive inputs** from previous step or external sources
2. **List all related resources** using ls/find commands (do NOT read file contents) if not clear from the input
3. **Determine the standards** to send to subagents to follow
4. **Create dynamic batches** following these rules:
   - Generate batches at runtime based on resources found
   - Limit each batch to max 10 resources
   - Assign one single subagent to perform all the tasks
5. **Use TodoWrite** to create task list from all batches (each batch = one todo item with status 'pending')
6. **Prepare task assignments** and instructions to be given to subagents
7. **Queue all batches** for parallel execution by subagents

**OUTPUT from Planning**: Task batch assignments as todos

#### Phase 2: Execution (Subagents)

<!-- INSTRUCTION:
You sends this exact message template to subagents.
- Choose execution expert (e.g., 'Senior Engineer', 'Backend Architect')
- List 3-5 technical principles for execution excellence
- Dispatch up to [X] subagents in parallel (typically 5-10)
- Decide a list of relevant standards to follow (can be none)
-->

**What You Send to Subagents**:

In a single message, you spin up subagents to perform subtasks in parallel, up to **[X]** subtasks at a time.

- **[IMPORTANT]** When there are any issues reported, you must stop dispatching further subagents until all issues have been rectified
- **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST ask all subagents to ultrathink hard about the task and requirements
- **[IMPORTANT]** Use TodoWrite to update each batch's status from 'pending' to 'in_progress' when dispatched

Request each subagent to perform the following steps with full detail:

<!-- INSTRUCTION:
- Omit the `Read the following assigned standards` section below if no standard is required
-->

    >>>
    **ultrathink: adopt the [Expert Title] mindset**

    - You're a **[Expert Title]** with deep expertise in [domain] who follows these technical principles:
      - **[Technical Principle 1]**: [Execution excellence focus]
      - **[Technical Principle 2]**: [Quality standards focus]
      - **[Technical Principle 3]**: [Domain-specific principle]

    **Read the following assigned standards** and follow them recursively (if A references B, read B too):

    - [path/to/standard-1.md]
    - [path/to/standard-2.md]
    - ...

    **Assignment**
    You're assigned with the following resources:

    - [resource 1]
    - [resource 2]
    - ...

    **Steps**

    1. [Specific action 1 - e.g., 'Read each resource file to understand current implementation']
    2. [Specific action 2 - e.g., 'Apply security standards to identify vulnerabilities']
    3. ...

    **Report**
    **[IMPORTANT]** You're requested to return the following:

    - [information 1 - e.g., 'List of modified resources']
    - [information 2 - e.g., 'Security issues found and fixed']
    - ...

    **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST return the following execution report (<1000 tokens):

    ```yaml
    status: success|failure|partial
    summary: 'Brief description of what was accomplished'
    modifications: ['resource 2', ...] # resources that have been modified
    outputs:
      [field1]: ...
      [field2]: ...
    issues: ['issue1', 'issue2', ...]  # only if problems encountered
    ```
    <<<

#### Phase 3: Review (Subagents)

<!-- INSTRUCTION:
- Omit this phase completely if the output of step 2 are deterministic (e.g. looking for id or compution result)
- Choose review expert (e.g., 'Quality Assurance Lead', 'Security Auditor')
- Dispatch review after critical changes or when execution reports show issues
- Usually 1-3 review subagents running in parallel
-->

In a single message, you spin up review subagents to check quality, up to **[Y]** review tasks at a time.

- **[IMPORTANT]** Review is read-only - subagents must NOT modify any resources
- **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST ask review subagents to be thorough and critical
- **[IMPORTANT]** Use TodoWrite to track review tasks separately from execution tasks

Request each review subagent to perform the following review with full scrutiny:

<!-- INSTRUCTION:
- Omit the `Read the following assigned standards` section below if no standard is required
-->

    >>>
    **ultrathink: adopt the [Review Expert Title] mindset**

    - You're a **[Review Expert Title]** with expertise in [domain] who follows these principles:
      - **[Review Principle 1]**: [Quality assurance focus]
      - **[Review Principle 2]**: [Standards compliance focus]
      - **[Review Principle 3]**: [Risk assessment focus]

    **Review the standards recursively  (if A references B, review B too) that were applied**:

    - [path/to/standard-1.md] - Verify compliance with this standard and its referenced standard
    - [path/to/standard-2.md] - Check all requirements are met
    - ...

    **Review Assignment**
    You're assigned to verify the following resources that were modified:

    - [resource 1]:
      - [Summary of what was done in phase 2 on resource 1]
    - [resource 2]:
      - [Summary of what was done in phase 2 on resource 2]
    - ...

    **Review Steps**

    1. [Review action 1 - e.g., 'Read modified resources to understand changes']
    2. [Review action 2 - e.g., 'Check compliance with each assigned standard']
    3. ...

    **Report**
    **[IMPORTANT]** You're requested to verify and report:

    - [Review item 1 - e.g., 'Security compliance status']
    - [Review item 2 - e.g., 'Functional correctness']
    - ...

    **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST return the following review report (<500 tokens):

    ```yaml
    status: pass|fail
    summary: 'Brief review summary'
    checks:
      [criterion1]: pass|fail
      [criterion2]: pass|fail
      ...
    fatals: ['issue1', 'issue2', ...]  # Only critical blockers
    warnings: ['warning1', 'warning2', ...]  # Non-blocking issues
    recommendation: proceed|retry|rollback
    ```
    <<<

#### Phase 4: Decision (You)

<!-- INSTRUCTION: You decide next action -->

**What You Do**:

1. **Analyze all reports** (execution + review if performed)
2. **Apply decision criteria**:
   - Review any critical failures
   - Consider review recommendations
3. **Select next action**:
   - **PROCEED**: All success or acceptable partial success → Move to next step
   - **FIX ISSUES**: Partial success with minor issues → Create new batches for failed items and perform phase 2 again → Review following phase 3 again → ||repeat||
   - **ROLLBACK**: Critical failures → Revert changes → Create new batches for failed items and perform phase 2 again → Review following phase 3 again → ||repeat||
4. **Use TodoWrite** to update task list based on decision:
   - If PROCEED: Mark remaining 'in_progress' items as 'completed'
   - If RETRY: Add new todo items for retry batches
   - If ROLLBACK: Mark all items as 'failed' and add rollback todos
5. **Prepare transition**:
   - If PROCEED: Package outputs for next step
   - If RETRY: Generate retry batches with same standards
   - If ROLLBACK: Identify rollback actions needed
