# Git Branch Management Skill

You are an expert in Git workflows, especially for creating, renaming, and managing branches following project conventions.

## Branch Naming Convention

For this project (11h.dev blog), all feature branches MUST follow this pattern:

```
claude/<descriptive-name>-<sessionID>
```

**Rules:**
- Always start with `claude/`
- Use kebab-case for the descriptive name
- End with the session ID (e.g., `-tL11U`)
- Keep descriptive name short but clear (2-4 words max)
- Use English for the descriptive name

**Examples:**
- ✅ `claude/effort-trap-article-tL11U`
- ✅ `claude/add-dark-mode-tL11U`
- ✅ `claude/fix-navbar-bug-tL11U`
- ❌ `claude/format-laziness-article-tL11U` (descriptive name doesn't match content)
- ❌ `feature/new-post` (wrong prefix)
- ❌ `claude/article` (missing session ID)

## When to Rename a Branch

Rename when:
1. **Content evolved significantly**: Started as "format article" but became "rewrite article"
2. **Language changed**: Branch named in French but content is English
3. **Scope changed**: Started as small fix, became major feature
4. **Clarity improved**: Generic name can be more specific

## How to Rename a Branch

### Option 1: Create New Branch (Recommended)
```bash
# Create new branch from current position
git checkout -b claude/new-name-<sessionID>

# Push new branch
git push -u origin claude/new-name-<sessionID>

# Optional: Delete old branch
git push origin --delete claude/old-name-<sessionID>
git branch -d claude/old-name-<sessionID>
```

**Pros:** Clean history, clear PR link
**Cons:** Creates duplicate branches temporarily

### Option 2: Rename Existing Branch
```bash
# Rename local branch
git branch -m claude/old-name-<sessionID> claude/new-name-<sessionID>

# Delete old remote branch
git push origin --delete claude/old-name-<sessionID>

# Push renamed branch
git push -u origin claude/new-name-<sessionID>
```

**Pros:** No duplicate branches
**Cons:** Breaks existing PR links

## Descriptive Name Guidelines

Match the branch name to the PRIMARY content/change:

| Content | Good Name | Bad Name |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| New article: "The Effort Trap" | `effort-trap-article` | `format-laziness-article` |
| French to English translation | `translate-to-english` | `update-post` |
| Add Jekyll config | `jekyll-config` | `update-config` |
| Fix navigation bug | `fix-navbar-bug` | `bug-fix` |

## Common Patterns

**For blog posts:**
- `<article-slug>-post-<sessionID>` for new articles
- `update-<article-slug>-<sessionID>` for major rewrites
- `translate-<article-slug>-<sessionID>` for translations

**For features:**
- `add-<feature-name>-<sessionID>`
- `implement-<feature-name>-<sessionID>`

**For fixes:**
- `fix-<issue-description>-<sessionID>`

**For refactoring:**
- `refactor-<component-name>-<sessionID>`

## Before Renaming Checklist

- [ ] Is the new name more accurate than the old one?
- [ ] Does it follow the `claude/<descriptive-name>-<sessionID>` pattern?
- [ ] Is the descriptive part clear and concise?
- [ ] Is it in English?
- [ ] Have I preserved the session ID?

## After Renaming

1. Update any local documentation
2. Update CLAUDE.md if branch name is referenced
3. Create PR from new branch name
4. Optionally delete old remote branch

When invoked, this skill will:
1. Analyze current branch name
2. Suggest better name if needed
3. Execute rename with proper commands
4. Verify successful push to remote
