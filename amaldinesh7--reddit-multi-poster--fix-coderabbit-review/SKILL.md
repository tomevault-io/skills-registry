# Fix CodeRabbit Review

Automatically fetch, categorize, and fix all CodeRabbit review comments for the current branch's PR.

## Workflow

Follow these steps **in order**. Do not skip steps.

### Step 1: Fetch Reviews

Run the helper script to get structured review data:

```bash
bash scripts/fetch-coderabbit-reviews.sh
```

If the script fails (no PR, `gh` not authenticated, etc.), report the error to the user and stop.

Parse the JSON output. The structure is:

```json
{
  "pr": { "number": 36, "title": "...", "url": "..." },
  "summary": { "inline_comments": 14, "review_level_comments": 2 },
  "inline_comments": [
    { "path": "src/foo.ts", "line": 42, "body": "...", "id": 123 }
  ],
  "review_bodies": [
    { "state": "COMMENTED", "body": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Categorize by Severity

Parse each comment's `body` field to extract severity. CodeRabbit uses these markers:

| Marker in body | Severity | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `🔴 Critical` | Critical | 1 (fix first) |
| `🟠 Major` | Major | 2 |
| `🟡 Minor` | Minor | 3 |
| No marker / informational | Info | 4 (skip unless actionable) |

Also look for these category markers:
- `⚠️ Potential issue` -- a bug or correctness problem, always fix
- `🛠️ Refactor suggestion` -- a code quality improvement, fix it
- `💡 Suggestion` / `📝 Note` -- informational, fix only if clearly actionable

**Skip** comments that are purely informational with no concrete code change suggested.

Group the remaining actionable comments by file path, then sort files so the highest-severity issue comes first.

### Step 3: Create a Todo List

Use `TodoWrite` to create a task list. Each todo item should include:
- The file path
- The severity level
- A short summary of what needs fixing

Order: Critical first, then Major, then Minor.

Example:
```
1. CRITICAL: Fix garbage className in components/ai/Foo.tsx
2. MAJOR: Add timeout to fetch calls in lib/api.ts
3. MINOR: Fix stale dep in useEffect in pages/index.tsx
```

### Step 4: Fix Each Issue

For each todo item, follow this loop:

1. **Mark as in_progress** via TodoWrite
2. **Read the affected file** (at minimum the lines around the issue)
3. **Understand the fix**:
   - If the comment body contains a `Prompt for AI Agents` block (inside `<details>` tags), use that as the primary instruction
   - If the comment contains a `Proposed fix` or `Committable suggestion` diff block, apply that diff
   - Otherwise, reason about the fix from the comment description
4. **Apply the fix** using StrReplace (or Write for full rewrites)
5. **Respect project rules**: Follow `.cursorrules` -- use shadcn Dialog (not hand-rolled modals), Tailwind only (no inline styles), try/catch for error handling, no `any` types, etc.
6. **Mark as completed** via TodoWrite

**Important**: Fix one issue at a time. Do not batch unrelated fixes into one edit.

### Step 5: Verify

After all fixes are applied:

1. Run `ReadLints` on every file that was modified
2. If new lint errors were introduced, fix them immediately
3. Confirm zero new lint errors before proceeding

### Step 6: Report Summary

Print a markdown summary for the user:

```markdown
## CodeRabbit Review Fixes -- PR #<number>

### Critical (<count>)
1. **`path/to/file.ts`** -- <short description of fix>

### Major (<count>)
1. **`path/to/file.ts`** -- <short description of fix>

### Minor (<count>)
1. **`path/to/file.ts`** -- <short description of fix>

### Skipped (<count>)
1. **`path/to/file.ts`** -- <reason skipped>

All fixes verified with linter. No new errors introduced.
```

## Edge Cases

- **No CodeRabbit comments**: Report "No CodeRabbit review comments found for this PR." and stop.
- **PR not found**: Report the error from the script and suggest the user push their branch or create a PR first.
- **Comment already resolved by prior code**: Read the file, check if the issue still exists. If already fixed, skip and note in summary.
- **Ambiguous fix**: If a comment does not have a clear code suggestion and the fix is ambiguous, describe what was found and ask the user for guidance rather than guessing.

## Tips

- CodeRabbit comments use the username `coderabbitai[bot]`
- The `Prompt for AI Agents` block inside comments is specifically written for AI consumption -- prefer it over the human-readable description
- Some comments include diff suggestions in markdown `suggestion` blocks -- these are directly applicable
- Always check if a fix has already been applied before making changes (the PR may have been updated since the review)
