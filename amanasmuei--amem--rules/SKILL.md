# /amem:rules — Generate Extraction Rules

Generate memory extraction guidelines for AI tools.

## Instructions

1. Run via Bash:
   ```
   amem-cli rules
   ```
   If `amem-cli` is not on PATH, use:
   ```
   npx @aman_asmuei/amem rules
   ```

2. This writes extraction rules to each tool's rules file:
   - Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md`
   - Cursor: `.cursorrules`
   - Windsurf: `.windsurfrules`
   - GitHub Copilot: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

3. To target a specific tool:
   ```
   amem-cli rules --tool cursor
   ```

4. To write to a custom path:
   ```
   amem-cli rules --path ./my-rules.md
   ```
