# cache best practices
the document outlines the best practices for writing cache related code in the codebase.

## when to use this skill
when you need to add or modify cache related code or user ask to optimize the cache related code to the codebase

## best practices
+ you should always try to use transaction within cache operation whenever possible to ensure data consistency, and rollback the transaction if the operation failed
+ you should separate different cache value into different database to have better maintainability, don't put all the cache value into the same database
+ you should always try to use cache eviction policy to ensure the cache value is always up to date
+ you should always try to use sorted set instead of list to store ordered data
+ you should try to use cuckoo filter when you need fast lookup if data present or not
