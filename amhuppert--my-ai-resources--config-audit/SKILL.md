# Config Audit

Audit and compare Claude Code and Cursor IDE configurations to understand feature coverage, identify gaps, and make informed decisions about AI development tooling.

## Overview

This skill helps analyze the `claude/` and `cursor/` directories in projects to:

1. **Inventory Resources** - Catalog all Claude Code commands, skills, agents and Cursor rules, commands
2. **Identify Gaps** - Find resources in one tool without equivalents in the other
3. **Generate Reports** - Produce structured comparisons and actionable suggestions
4. **Inform Decisions** - Understand feature differences to guide tool selection and migration

**When to use**: When managing AI configurations across Claude Code and Cursor, planning migrations, or deciding where to implement new workflows.

## Quick Start

Run the audit command to generate a comprehensive report:

```bash
ai skill config-audit run
```

This scans the current project's `claude/` and `cursor/` directories and outputs a detailed report showing:

- All Claude Code resources (commands, skills, agents)
- All Cursor resources (rules, commands)
- Gap analysis (resources unique to each tool)
- Suggestions for creating equivalents

## Using the Audit Command

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Audit current project
ai skill config-audit run

# Audit specific project
ai skill config-audit run -p /path/to/project

# Get JSON output for programmatic processing
ai skill config-audit run --json
```

### Understanding the Report

The audit report contains four main sections:

#### 1. Claude Code Resources

Lists all resources found in the `claude/` directory:

- **Commands** - User-invoked slash commands (`.claude/commands/`)
- **Skills** - Model-invoked capabilities (`.claude/skills/`)
- **Agents** - Specialized sub-agents (`.claude/agents/`)

Each resource shows:

- Name
- Type
- Description (if available)

#### 2. Cursor Resources

Lists all resources found in the `cursor/` directory:

- **Rules** - AI instructions in `.mdc` format, categorized by type:
  - **Always** - Always loaded (`alwaysApply: true`)
  - **Auto Attached** - Loaded when file globs match
  - **Agent Requested** - AI decides based on description
  - **Manual** - User invokes with `@ruleName`
- **Commands** - Markdown prompt files

Each rule shows:

- Name
- Type (always/auto-attached/agent-requested/manual)
- Description
- Globs (for auto-attached rules)

#### 3. Gap Analysis

Identifies resources that exist in one tool but not the other:

- **Claude Code Without Cursor Equivalents** - Features unique to Claude Code
- **Cursor Without Claude Code Equivalents** - Features unique to Cursor

Resources are matched by name similarity, so a Claude Code skill named "typescript-standards" and a Cursor rule named "typescript-standards" are considered equivalents.

#### 4. Suggestions

Actionable recommendations for creating equivalents:

- Cursor rules to add for Claude Code features
- Claude Code skills/commands to add for Cursor features
- CLAUDE.md additions for Cursor "always" rules

## Feature Comparison

### Key Differences

**Claude Code Capabilities**:

- Executable commands with tool permissions
- Sub-agents with separate context windows
- Helper commands (TypeScript utilities)
- Event-driven hooks
- Progressive resource loading

**Cursor Capabilities**:

- Glob pattern matching for auto-attachment
- Four rule attachment modes (Always/Auto/Agent/Manual)
- Manual invocation with @ruleName syntax
- Lightweight single-file rules

**See @references/feature-comparison.md for comprehensive comparison**

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Initial Audit

When setting up a new project or reviewing existing configuration:

1. Run audit: `ai skill config-audit run`
2. Review gap analysis section
3. Prioritize gaps based on project needs
4. Create missing equivalents as needed

### Workflow 2: Migration Planning

When migrating from Cursor to Claude Code (or vice versa):

1. Run audit with JSON output: `ai skill config-audit run --json`
2. Review all resources in source tool
3. Consult feature comparison guide for migration patterns
4. Systematically create equivalents in target tool

### Workflow 3: Feature Parity Maintenance

When adding new AI workflows:

1. Implement in preferred tool (Claude Code or Cursor)
2. Run audit to identify new gap
3. Decide if equivalent is needed in other tool
4. Create equivalent using appropriate patterns

## Creating Equivalents

### Claude Code Command → Cursor Command

Claude Code commands with `allowed-tools` cannot be directly replicated (Cursor commands don't execute code). Consider:

- Create Cursor command as text-only prompt template
- Or skip if code execution is essential

### Claude Code Skill → Cursor Rule

1. Extract core instructions from SKILL.md
2. Create `.cursor/rules/[name].mdc` with appropriate frontmatter:
   - Choose rule type (Always/Auto/Agent/Manual)
   - Add globs if auto-attached
   - Add description for agent-requested
3. Keep under 500 lines (decompose if needed)
4. Remove helper command references (not supported)

### Cursor Always Rule → CLAUDE.md

For critical always-loaded standards:

1. Extract rule content
2. Add to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in appropriate section
3. Use XML tags for safe merging if needed

### Cursor Auto-Attached Rule → Claude Code Skill

1. Create skill with description mentioning relevant file types
2. Include instructions from rule body
3. Add helper commands if repetitive operations exist

### Cursor Manual Rule → Claude Code Command

1. Create `.claude/commands/[name].md`
2. Add rule content as command body
3. Add `allowed-tools` if code execution needed
4. Invoke with `/command-name` instead of `@ruleName`

## Helper Commands

This skill provides the `ai skill config-audit run` command for deterministic configuration auditing.

**Implementation**: See `typescript/lib/config-audit-operations.ts` for scanning and comparison logic.

**Command options**:

- `-p, --project-root <path>` - Project root directory (default: current directory)
- `--json` - Output as JSON instead of formatted text

## Resources

### references/feature-comparison.md

Comprehensive comparison of Claude Code and Cursor features including:

- Detailed capability breakdowns
- Functional equivalencies table
- Unique features in each tool
- Migration considerations
- When to use each feature type

Reference this when:

- Planning migrations between tools
- Deciding where to implement new workflows
- Understanding fundamental feature differences

## Interpreting Results

### High Gap Count

Many resources without equivalents suggests:

- **Single-tool focus** - Team primarily using one tool
- **Migration in progress** - Transitioning between tools
- **Specialization** - Leveraging unique capabilities

**Actions**:

- Review whether equivalents are needed
- Focus on high-value workflows first
- Consider tool consolidation if maintaining both is burdensome

### Low Gap Count

Few resources without equivalents suggests:

- **Feature parity** - Comprehensive coverage in both tools
- **Parallel development** - Team actively maintains both
- **Shared workflows** - Common processes across tools

**Actions**:

- Maintain parity for new workflows
- Document equivalent resource pairs
- Streamline maintenance procedures

### Type-Specific Gaps

Patterns in gap types reveal opportunities:

- **Many skills without rules** - Rich Claude Code workflows, lighter Cursor setup
- **Many always rules without CLAUDE.md** - Cursor-heavy standards not in Claude Code
- **Commands without equivalents** - Tool-specific automations

**Actions**:

- Evaluate whether gaps represent intentional choices
- Create equivalents for essential workflows
- Accept gaps for tool-specific features

## Best Practices

**Audit Regularly**:

- Run audit after major changes
- Include in code review process
- Track gaps over time

**Prioritize Thoughtfully**:

- Not all resources need equivalents
- Focus on high-impact workflows
- Consider maintenance burden

**Document Decisions**:

- Record why gaps exist
- Note intentional tool-specific features
- Update comparison guide with learnings

**Maintain Feature Comparison**:

- Update references/feature-comparison.md as tools evolve
- Document new feature types
- Share insights with team
