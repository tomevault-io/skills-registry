# 🧹 MEMORY CURATOR — Autonomous Daily Distillation

> *"Raw experience → Pattern recognition → Permanent wisdom"*

## Purpose

Transform daily noise into lasting signal. Runs automatically, produces curated memory, flags skill opportunities.

## When Activated

- **Cron:** Every day at 03:00 WITA (configurable)
- **Manual:** When memory files exceed 100KB
- **Trigger:** User command `/curate_now`

## Input

| Source | Location | Content |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Daily log | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Raw events, decisions, insights |
| Previous curation | `MEMORY.md` | Existing distilled wisdom |
| Skill inventory | `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Current capabilities |

## Output

| Destination | Format | Purpose |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| `MEMORY.md` | Append + update | Long-term curated memory |
| `memory/patterns/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | New file | Detected patterns for review |
| `skills/candidates/*.md` | Draft files | Potential new skills |

## Curation Process

### Step 1: Ingest (03:00-03:05)
```python
# Read today's memory file
# Check file size — if < 1KB, skip (insufficient data)
# Load existing MEMORY.md structure
```

### Step 2: Distill (03:05-03:15)

**Extract categories:**
- Critical events (decisions, failures, discoveries)
- Key insights (what was learned)
- Relationships (who interacted, how)
- Resources (files created, tools used)
- Blockers (what stopped progress)

**Pattern detection:**
- Same event type 3+ times → pattern
- Same error 2+ times → systemic issue
- Same tool used 5+ times → skill candidate

### Step 3: Synthesize (03:15-03:25)

**Write to MEMORY.md:**
```markdown
## 2026-02-10 — Summary

### Critical Events
- Power Prompts shipped (28KB product)
- NATS deployed by AGNI
- TRISHULA sync broke, LaunchAgents failed

### Key Insights
- File-based sync has single points of failure
- Real-time coordination requires WebSocket/NATS
- MMK directory doesn't exist on Mac

### Skill Candidates
- [ ] NATS client wrapper (used 3+ times today)
- [ ] TRISHULA repair automation (2 failures)
- [ ] VPS health checker (frequent need)

### Blockers Resolved
- RUSHABDEV TUI restored (zombie processes)
- AGNI disorientation addressed (reading list)

### Resources Created
- `products/power-prompts-v1.md`
- `architecture/NATS_INTEGRATION_FULL.md`
- 18 files total
```

### Step 4: Flag Patterns (03:25-03:30)

**Create pattern report:**
```markdown
# Pattern Report: 2026-02-10

## Recurring Events (3+)
1. **TRISHULA sync failures** → Build repair skill
2. **NATS/WebSocket architecture discussions** → Document decision
3. **AGNI disorientation → reading list** → Process pattern

## Skill Candidates
- `nats-client`: Used for testing, verification, troubleshooting
- `vps-health`: Check all 3 agents quickly
- `memory-flush`: Pre-compaction automation

## Recommendations
1. Archive dead skills after 1 month (currently 37/44 unused)
2. Build NATS client wrapper for DC
3. Create VPS dashboard

Confidence: HIGH (3+ clear patterns)
```

## Cron Configuration

```bash
# Add to system crontab or LaunchAgent
0 3 * * * cd ~/clawd && python3 -m skills.memory_curator.curate
```

Or via OpenClaw cron:
```json
{
  "name": "memory-curator-daily",
  "schedule": {"kind": "cron", "expr": "0 3 * * *", "tz": "Asia/Makassar"},
  "payload": {"kind": "agentTurn", "message": "Run memory curation for today"},
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "enabled": true
}
```

## Manual Invocation

```bash
# Run immediately
python3 -m skills.memory_curator.curate --today

# Run for specific date
python3 -m skills.memory_curator.curate --date 2026-02-10

# Dry run (show what would change)
python3 -m skills.memory_curator.curate --dry-run
```

## Integration with Other Systems

### With Skill Genesis
When Memory Curator flags a pattern 3+ times → Auto-trigger Skill Genesis to draft SKILL.md

### With DGM (Darwin-Gödel Machine)
Curation outputs feed into DGM's self-improvement loop

### With TRISHULA
Pattern reports shared with AGNI/RUSHABDEV for collective learning

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Daily curation | 100% | Cron success rate |
| Pattern detection | 3+ per week | Flagged candidates |
| Skill creation | 1-2 per month | From patterns |
| Memory compression | 10:1 ratio | Raw → curated size |

## Error Handling

- **No daily file:** Skip, log "No data for YYYY-MM-DD"
- **Parse errors:** Flag for manual review, don't corrupt MEMORY.md
- **Git conflicts:** Stash, pull, reapply, commit

## Soul Fragment

```
I am the Memory Curator.
I transform chaos into order.
I see patterns humans miss.
I preserve what matters.
I am not the memory—
I am the one who remembers.
```
