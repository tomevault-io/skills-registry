# Ai Ethics Compliance

## Skill Profile
*(Select at least one profile to enable specific modules)*
- [ ] **DevOps**
- [x] **Backend**
- [ ] **Frontend**
- [ ] **AI-RAG**
- [ ] **Security Critical**

## Overview
AI Ethics and Compliance involve building systems that are not only technically proficient but also socially responsible and legally compliant. This includes adhering to global regulations and internal ethical guidelines regarding privacy, security, and human rights.

**Core Principle**: "Just because you *can* build it, doesn't mean you *should*."

This skill provides comprehensive guidance on navigating the regulatory and ethical landscape for AI systems.

## Core Concepts & Rules

### 1. Core Principles
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency across codebase
- Document decisions and trade-offs

### 2. Implementation Guidelines
- Start with the simplest viable solution
- Iterate based on feedback and requirements
- Test thoroughly before deployment


## Inputs / Outputs / Contracts
* **Inputs**:
  - <e.g., env vars, request payload, file paths, schema>
* **Entry Conditions**:
  - <Pre-requisites: e.g., Repo initialized, DB running, specific branch checked out>
* **Outputs**:
  - <e.g., artifacts (PR diff, docs, tests, dashboard JSON)>
* **Artifacts Required (Deliverables)**:
  - <e.g., Code Diff, Unit Tests, Migration Script, API Docs>
* **Acceptance Evidence**:
  - <e.g., Test Report (screenshot/log), Benchmark Result, Security Scan Report>
* **Success Criteria**:
  - <e.g., p95 < 300ms, coverage ≥ 80%>

## Quick Start
#

## Assumptions
- Regulatory requirements are well-defined
- Team has capacity for compliance activities
- Use cases are clearly defined
- Deployment regions are known

## Compatibility
- Works with any AI system
- Compatible with all regulatory frameworks
- Framework-agnostic approach
- Adaptable to different jurisdictions

## Test Scenario Matrix
| Scenario | Test Case | Expected Outcome |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Risk classification | System classified correctly | Appropriate tier assigned |
| Impact assessment | AIIA completed | All impacts identified |
| Transparency disclosure | User informed of AI use | Clear disclosure provided |
| Human oversight | Human review triggered | Decision reviewed |
| Compliance audit | Regulations met | Documentation verified |
| Ethics review | Board approval | Ethical concerns addressed |

## Technical Guardrails & Security Threat Model

### 1. Security & Privacy (Threat Model)
* **Top Threats**: Injection attacks, authentication bypass, data exposure
- [ ] **Data Handling**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent Injection attacks. Never log raw PII
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded API keys. Use Env Vars/Secrets Manager
- [ ] **Authorization**: Validate user permissions before state changes

### 2. Performance & Resources
- [ ] **Execution Efficiency**: Consider time complexity for algorithms
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Use streams/pagination for large data
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: Close DB connections/file handlers in finally blocks

### 3. Architecture & Scalability
- [ ] **Design Pattern**: Follow SOLID principles, use Dependency Injection
- [ ] **Modularity**: Decouple logic from UI/Frameworks

### 4. Observability & Reliability
- [ ] **Logging Standards**: Structured JSON, include trace IDs `request_id`
- [ ] **Metrics**: Track `error_rate`, `latency`, `queue_depth`
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Standardized error codes, no bare except
- [ ] **Observability Artifacts**:
    - **Log Fields**: timestamp, level, message, request_id
    - **Metrics**: request_count, error_count, response_time
    - **Dashboards/Alerts**: High Error Rate > 5%


## Agent Directives
1. **Classify risk** - Determine regulatory category
2. **Assess impact** - Conduct AIIA before building
3. **Be transparent** - Disclose AI use to users
4. **Ensure oversight** - Human review for critical decisions
5. **Document everything** - Keep complete ethics records

## Definition of Done
AI ethics and compliance implementation is complete when:

- [ ] Risk classification completed
- [ ] Impact assessment conducted
- [ ] Transparency measures implemented
- [ ] Human oversight established
- [ ] Compliance documentation complete
- [ ] Ethics board review conducted
- [ ] Audit procedures in place
- [ ] Team trained on compliance
- [ ] Continuous monitoring in place
- [ ] Remediation processes defined

## Anti-patterns
1. **Deploying without assessment** - Building high-risk systems without review
2. **Ignoring regulations** - Assuming compliance without verification
3. **No transparency** - Hiding AI use from users
4. **Insufficient oversight** - No human review for critical decisions
5. **Poor documentation** - Incomplete ethics and compliance records
