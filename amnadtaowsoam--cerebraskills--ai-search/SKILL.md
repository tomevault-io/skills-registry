# Ai Search

## Skill Profile
*(Select at least one profile to enable specific modules)*
- [ ] **DevOps**
- [x] **Backend**
- [ ] **Frontend**
- [ ] **AI-RAG**
- [ ] **Security Critical**

## Overview
AI-powered search uses language models and vector embeddings to provide more intelligent and contextual search results. Unlike traditional keyword search, AI search understands intent, semantics, and context to deliver more relevant results through semantic understanding, vector similarity, and re-ranking.

## Why This Matters
- **Reduces Search Failures**: Semantic understanding finds relevant content even with different terminology
- **Increases Conversion Rates**: Better results lead to higher user engagement and conversion
- **Consistent Experience**: Standardized search quality across all user queries
- **Reduces Support Burden**: Self-service search reduces support ticket volume
- **Enables Discovery**: Finds hidden information users wouldn't find with keyword search

## Core Concepts & Rules

### 1. Core Principles
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency across codebase
- Document decisions and trade-offs

### 2. Implementation Guidelines
- Start with the simplest viable solution
- Iterate based on feedback and requirements
- Test thoroughly before deployment


## Inputs / Outputs / Contracts
* **Inputs**:
  - Search queries (text, natural language)
  - Document collection (text files, web pages, database records)
  - User context (session data, preferences, history)
* **Entry Conditions**:
  - Vector database initialized and populated with embeddings
  - Embedding model selected and configured
  - Search API endpoints deployed and accessible
* **Outputs**:
  - Search results with relevance scores
  - Ranked list of documents
  - Metadata (similarity scores, sources, timestamps)
* **Artifacts Required (Deliverables)**:
  - Embedding generation pipeline
  - Vector database schema and indexes
  - Search API implementation
  - Re-ranking logic
  - Search UI components
* **Acceptance Evidence**:
  - Search accuracy benchmarks (NDCG, precision@k)
  - Performance metrics (latency, throughput)
  - User satisfaction surveys
* **Success Criteria**:
  - Search success rate > 95%
  - Average latency < 500ms (p95)
  - Relevance score > 0.7 for top results
  - Cache hit rate > 80% for repeated queries

## Quick Start / Implementation Example

1. Review requirements and constraints
2. Set up development environment
3. Implement core functionality following patterns
4. Write tests for critical paths
5. Run tests and fix issues
6. Document any deviations or decisions

```python
# Example implementation following best practices
def example_function():
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```


## Assumptions / Constraints / Non-goals

* **Assumptions**:
  - Development environment is properly configured
  - Required dependencies are available
  - Team has basic understanding of domain
* **Constraints**:
  - Must follow existing codebase conventions
  - Time and resource limitations
  - Compatibility requirements
* **Non-goals**:
  - This skill does not cover edge cases outside scope
  - Not a replacement for formal training


## Compatibility & Prerequisites

* **Supported Versions**:
  - Python 3.8+
  - Node.js 16+
  - Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
* **Required AI Tools**:
  - Code editor (VS Code recommended)
  - Testing framework appropriate for language
  - Version control (Git)
* **Dependencies**:
  - Language-specific package manager
  - Build tools
  - Testing libraries
* **Environment Setup**:
  - `.env.example` keys: `API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL` (no values)


## Test Scenario Matrix (QA Strategy)

| Type | Focus Area | Required Scenarios / Mocks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit** | Core Logic | Must cover primary logic and at least 3 edge/error cases. Target minimum 80% coverage |
| **Integration** | DB / API | All external API calls or database connections must be mocked during unit tests |
| **E2E** | User Journey | Critical user flows to test |
| **Performance** | Latency / Load | Benchmark requirements |
| **Security** | Vuln / Auth | SAST/DAST or dependency audit |
| **Frontend** | UX / A11y | Accessibility checklist (WCAG), Performance Budget (Lighthouse score) |


## Technical Guardrails & Security Threat Model

### 1. Security & Privacy (Threat Model)
* **Top Threats**: Injection attacks, authentication bypass, data exposure
- [ ] **Data Handling**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent Injection attacks. Never log raw PII
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded API keys. Use Env Vars/Secrets Manager
- [ ] **Authorization**: Validate user permissions before state changes

### 2. Performance & Resources
- [ ] **Execution Efficiency**: Consider time complexity for algorithms
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Use streams/pagination for large data
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: Close DB connections/file handlers in finally blocks

### 3. Architecture & Scalability
- [ ] **Design Pattern**: Follow SOLID principles, use Dependency Injection
- [ ] **Modularity**: Decouple logic from UI/Frameworks

### 4. Observability & Reliability
- [ ] **Logging Standards**: Structured JSON, include trace IDs `request_id`
- [ ] **Metrics**: Track `error_rate`, `latency`, `queue_depth`
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Standardized error codes, no bare except
- [ ] **Observability Artifacts**:
    - **Log Fields**: timestamp, level, message, request_id
    - **Metrics**: request_count, error_count, response_time
    - **Dashboards/Alerts**: High Error Rate > 5%


## Agent Directives & Error Recovery
*(ข้อกำหนดสำหรับ AI Agent ในการคิดและแก้ปัญหาเมื่อเกิดข้อผิดพลาด)*

- **Thinking Process**: Analyze root cause before fixing. Do not brute-force.
- **Fallback Strategy**: Stop after 3 failed test attempts. Output root cause and ask for human intervention/clarification.
- **Self-Review**: Check against Guardrails & Anti-patterns before finalizing.
- **Output Constraints**: Output ONLY the modified code block. Do not explain unless asked.


## Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

- [ ] Tests passed + coverage met
- [ ] Lint/Typecheck passed
- [ ] Logging/Metrics/Trace implemented
- [ ] Security checks passed
- [ ] Documentation/Changelog updated
- [ ] Accessibility/Performance requirements met (if frontend)


## Anti-patterns / Pitfalls

* ⛔ **Don't**: Log PII, catch-all exception, N+1 queries
* ⚠️ **Watch out for**: Common symptoms and quick fixes
* 💡 **Instead**: Use proper error handling, pagination, and logging


## Reference Links & Examples

* Internal documentation and examples
* Official documentation and best practices
* Community resources and discussions


## Versioning & Changelog

* **Version**: 1.0.0
* **Changelog**:
  - 2026-02-22: Initial version with complete template structure
