# Api First Product Strategy

## Skill Profile
*(Select at least one profile to enable specific modules)*
- [ ] **DevOps**
- [x] **Backend**
- [ ] **Frontend**
- [ ] **AI-RAG**
- [ ] **Security Critical**

## Overview
API-First Product Strategy treats APIs as first-class citizens in product design, enabling better integration, developer experience, and ecosystem growth. This approach is essential for modern SaaS products, platform businesses, and any product requiring third-party integration.

## Why This Matters
**Strategic Necessity:**

- **Developer Experience**: Improve DX for API consumers with clear, consistent APIs
- **Integration**: Enable seamless third-party integration through well-documented contracts
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Foster partner and developer ecosystem growth
- **Time-to-Market**: Accelerate development through parallel API and UI work
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple client types (web, mobile, IoT) from single API

## Core Concepts & Rules

### 1. Core Principles
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency across codebase
- Document decisions and trade-offs

### 2. Implementation Guidelines
- Start with the simplest viable solution
- Iterate based on feedback and requirements
- Test thoroughly before deployment


## Inputs / Outputs / Contracts
* **Inputs**:
  - <e.g., env vars, request payload, file paths, schema>
* **Entry Conditions**:
  - <Pre-requisites: e.g., Repo initialized, DB running, specific branch checked out>
* **Outputs**:
  - <e.g., artifacts (PR diff, docs, tests, dashboard JSON)>
* **Artifacts Required (Deliverables)**:
  - <e.g., Code Diff, Unit Tests, Migration Script, API Docs>
* **Acceptance Evidence**:
  - <e.g., Test Report (screenshot/log), Benchmark Result, Security Scan Report>
* **Success Criteria**:
  - <e.g., p95 < 300ms, coverage ≥ 80%>

## Skill Composition
* **Depends on**: None
* **Compatible with**: None
* **Conflicts with**: None
* **Related Skills**: None

## Quick Start / Implementation Example

1. Review requirements and constraints
2. Set up development environment
3. Implement core functionality following patterns
4. Write tests for critical paths
5. Run tests and fix issues
6. Document any deviations or decisions

```python
# Example implementation following best practices
def example_function():
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```


## Assumptions
- Product requirements are well-defined before API design
- Development team has API design expertise
- Target audience includes developers or partners
- Sufficient resources for documentation and SDK development
- API gateway infrastructure available

## Compatibility & Prerequisites

* **Supported Versions**:
  - Python 3.8+
  - Node.js 16+
  - Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
* **Required AI Tools**:
  - Code editor (VS Code recommended)
  - Testing framework appropriate for language
  - Version control (Git)
* **Dependencies**:
  - Language-specific package manager
  - Build tools
  - Testing libraries
* **Environment Setup**:
  - `.env.example` keys: `API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL` (no values)


## Test Scenario Matrix
| Scenario | Description | Expected Outcome |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| API Design | Design API from product requirements | Complete endpoint definitions with schemas |
| Documentation Generation | Generate OpenAPI specification | Valid OpenAPI 3.0 spec with all endpoints |
| SDK Generation | Generate client SDKs | Working SDKs for JavaScript, Python, Java |
| Validation | Validate API design | No errors, minimal warnings |
| Developer Portal | Deploy interactive documentation | Working Swagger UI and Redoc |
| Versioning | Apply versioning strategy | Versioned endpoints with clear paths |
| Security | Apply authentication and rate limiting | All endpoints secured and rate-limited |

## Technical Guardrails & Security Threat Model

### 1. Security & Privacy (Threat Model)
* **Top Threats**: Injection attacks, authentication bypass, data exposure
- [ ] **Data Handling**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent Injection attacks. Never log raw PII
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded API keys. Use Env Vars/Secrets Manager
- [ ] **Authorization**: Validate user permissions before state changes

### 2. Performance & Resources
- [ ] **Execution Efficiency**: Consider time complexity for algorithms
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Use streams/pagination for large data
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: Close DB connections/file handlers in finally blocks

### 3. Architecture & Scalability
- [ ] **Design Pattern**: Follow SOLID principles, use Dependency Injection
- [ ] **Modularity**: Decouple logic from UI/Frameworks

### 4. Observability & Reliability
- [ ] **Logging Standards**: Structured JSON, include trace IDs `request_id`
- [ ] **Metrics**: Track `error_rate`, `latency`, `queue_depth`
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Standardized error codes, no bare except
- [ ] **Observability Artifacts**:
    - **Log Fields**: timestamp, level, message, request_id
    - **Metrics**: request_count, error_count, response_time
    - **Dashboards/Alerts**: High Error Rate > 5%


## Agent Directives
1. **Design Phase**: Always design API before implementation
2. **Documentation First**: Generate OpenAPI spec before coding
3. **Validation**: Validate API design before proceeding
4. **Security**: Apply security best practices to all endpoints
5. **Developer Experience**: Prioritize developer experience in all decisions

## Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

- [ ] Tests passed + coverage met
- [ ] Lint/Typecheck passed
- [ ] Logging/Metrics/Trace implemented
- [ ] Security checks passed
- [ ] Documentation/Changelog updated
- [ ] Accessibility/Performance requirements met (if frontend)


## Anti-patterns / Pitfalls

* ⛔ **Don't**: Log PII, catch-all exception, N+1 queries
* ⚠️ **Watch out for**: Common symptoms and quick fixes
* 💡 **Instead**: Use proper error handling, pagination, and logging


## Reference Links & Examples

* Internal documentation and examples
* Official documentation and best practices
* Community resources and discussions


## Versioning & Changelog

* **Version**: 1.0.0
* **Changelog**:
  - 2026-02-22: Initial version with complete template structure
