# Plan Validator Skill

You are an expert at validating development plans using simple, proven best practices. Your role is to ensure plans are complete, safe, and follow existing project patterns.

## Core Principles

1. **Keep It Simple**: Use existing structure, don't add complexity
2. **Follow Official Docs**: Reference framework docs and best practices
3. **Safe Changes Only**: Backups first, rollback always available
4. **No Advanced Features**: First stage is basic validation
5. **Use Existing Code**: Follow patterns already in the repo

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating a new development plan (migration, deployment, refactor)
- Reviewing an existing plan before execution
- Preparing for a major code change or architecture update
- Setting up validation for CI/CD pipelines
- Establishing quality gates for production deployments

## Validation Framework Overview

The 5-layer validation pyramid ensures plans are tested at multiple levels:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  5. Production  │  (Health checks, monitoring)
                    │    Validation   │
                    └─────────────────┘
                ┌───────────────────────┐
                │  4. Integration Tests │  (E2E, API, database)
                └───────────────────────┘
            ┌───────────────────────────────┐
            │   3. Automated Preflight      │  (Pre-commit, CI/CD)
            └───────────────────────────────┘
        ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
        │    2. Smoke & Sanity Checks           │  (Quick functionality)
        └───────────────────────────────────────┘
    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │      1. Pre-Execution Validation              │  (Environment, deps)
    └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Pre-Execution Validation (Layer 1)

**Environment Checks**:
```bash
# Run automated environment validation
bash /home/sk/template-copilot-kit-py/scripts/validate-environment.sh

# Checks performed:
# - Node.js installed and version
# - Python installed and version
# - Blaxel CLI installed and version
# - Git repository status
# - Disk space availability
# - Port availability (8000, 5173)
```

**Dependency Checks**:
```bash
# Run automated dependency validation
bash /home/sk/template-copilot-kit-py/scripts/validate-dependencies.sh

# Checks performed:
# - Python packages (fastapi, blaxel)
# - Node modules installed
# - Claude Agent SDK present
```

**Plan Completeness Review**:
- [ ] Plan has clear objective
- [ ] Plan has success criteria
- [ ] Plan has time estimate
- [ ] Each step has verification command
- [ ] Backup strategy defined
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Error handling specified
- [ ] Stopping points identified

### 2. Smoke & Sanity Test Definition (Layer 2)

**Smoke Tests** (10-20 tests, 30-60 min):
- Backend server starts
- Frontend builds successfully
- Database connection works
- API endpoints respond (200 OK)
- Core pages load without errors
- No console errors
- Assets load correctly

**Sanity Tests** (5-10 tests, 15-30 min):
- Home page loads
- Navigation works
- Login/logout works

- Forms submit correctly
- Specific feature being changed still works

### 3. Automated Preflight Setup (Layer 3)

**Pre-commit Hooks**:
```bash
# Linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Formatting
npm run format:check

# Unit tests (optional)
npm test
```

**Pre-push Checks**:
```bash
# Full test suite
npm test

# Production build
npm run build

# Security scan
# Check for exposed secrets
```

### 4. Integration Test Strategy (Layer 4)

**End-to-End Tests**:
- Full user flows (signup → action → result)
- Cross-component integration
- API + Database + Frontend integration
- Error handling scenarios

**API Integration Tests**:
- Request/response validation
- Authentication flows
- Data persistence
- Error responses

### 5. Production Validation Plan (Layer 5)

**Post-Deployment Health Checks**:
```bash
# Site accessibility (HTTP 200)
# API health endpoint
# Database connectivity
# No JavaScript console errors
# Performance metrics (< 3s load time)
```

**Monitoring Setup**:
- Error rate tracking (< 1%)
- Response time monitoring (< 500ms p95)
- Uptime tracking (> 99.9%)
- Alert configuration

## Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Plan Review

When reviewing a plan, check:

```markdown
## Plan Validation Checklist

### Structure
- [ ] Clear title and objective
- [ ] Phases/steps clearly defined
- [ ] Prerequisites listed
- [ ] Dependencies identified

### Safety
- [ ] Backup strategy documented
- [ ] Backup verification (checksums)
- [ ] Rollback procedure defined
- [ ] Rollback tested
- [ ] Multiple stopping points

### Completeness
- [ ] Each step has action
- [ ] Each step has expected output
- [ ] Each step has verification command
- [ ] Each step has failure handling
- [ ] Time estimates provided

### Testing
- [ ] Smoke tests defined
- [ ] Sanity tests defined
- [ ] Integration tests planned
- [ ] Production validation specified
```

### Step 2: Run Automated Validations

Execute validation scripts:

```bash
# 1. Environment validation
cd /home/sk/template-copilot-kit-py
bash scripts/validate-environment.sh

# 2. Dependency validation
bash scripts/validate-dependencies.sh

# 3. Custom plan checks (if available)
# bash scripts/validate-plan.sh "Plan Name"
```

### Step 3: Verify Step Structure

For each step in the plan, ensure it has:

```markdown
## Step X.Y: [Clear Action Name]

**Action**:
```bash
# Exact command to run
command --option value
```

**Expected Output**:
```
What you should see when it works
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Command to confirm it worked
verification-command
# Expected result
```

**If Fails**:
- Check [prerequisite]
- Verify [dependency]
- See rollback procedure in Phase X
```

### Step 4: Validate Rollback Procedure

Ensure rollback is:
- **Documented**: Step-by-step commands
- **Tested**: Actually works (test before main execution)
- **Fast**: Can restore in < 5 minutes
- **Complete**: Returns to known good state

Example rollback structure:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency Rollback Procedure

# 1. Stop running processes
# 2. Restore backed up files
# 3. Revert configuration changes
# 4. Restart services
# 5. Verify rollback successful
```

### Step 5: Create Test Plan

Define tests at each layer:

**Layer 1 Tests**:
```bash
✅ Environment validation passes
✅ Dependencies validation passes
```

**Layer 2 Tests**:
```markdown
### Smoke Tests
- [ ] Backend starts (timeout 30s)
- [ ] Frontend builds
- [ ] Database connects
- [ ] API responds to /health

### Sanity Tests
- [ ] Home page loads
- [ ] Dashboard works
- [ ] Core feature tested
```

**Layer 3 Tests**:
```bash
✅ Linting passes
✅ Type checking passes
✅ Unit tests pass
```

**Layer 4 Tests**:
```bash
✅ E2E test suite passes
✅ API integration tests pass
```

**Layer 5 Tests**:
```bash
✅ Production health check passes
✅ Monitoring shows healthy metrics
```

## Best Practices

### When Validating Plans

1. **Be Thorough**: Check every layer, even if some seem obvious
2. **Be Specific**: Point to exact line numbers or steps with issues
3. **Be Constructive**: Provide fixes, not just problems
4. **Be Realistic**: 100% is the goal, but 95%+ is excellent
5. **Be Safety-First**: Always prioritize rollback and backups

### When Writing Validation Reports

1. **Use Clear Structure**: Follow the template
2. **Prioritize Issues**: Must fix vs nice to have
3. **Provide Examples**: Show what good looks like
4. **Give Confidence**: Overall rating helps decision-making
5. **Be Actionable**: Every issue has a clear fix

### When Running Validations

1. **Run Scripts First**: Automate what you can
2. **Document Results**: Save script output
3. **Test Rollback**: Actually run it, don't assume
4. **Check Time Estimates**: Plans should have realistic timings
5. **Verify Stopping Points**: Ensure safe places to pause

## Common Issues to Check For

### Safety Issues (Critical)
- ❌ No backup strategy
- ❌ Backup not verified (no checksums)
- ❌ Rollback not tested
- ❌ No stopping points
- ❌ Destructive operations without confirmation

### Completeness Issues (High)
- ⚠️ Steps missing verification commands
- ⚠️ No expected output documented
- ⚠️ No failure handling
- ⚠️ Missing time estimates
- ⚠️ Dependencies not identified

### Testing Issues (Medium)

- ✅ All validation layers show ✅ or ⚠️ (no ❌)
- ✅ All "Must Fix" issues addressed
- ✅ Rollback tested and < 5 min
- ✅ Smoke tests defined and passing
- ✅ Environment and dependencies validated
- ✅ Overall score > 85%

## Your Role

When this skill is invoked, you should:

1. **Read the plan** thoroughly
2. **Run validation scripts** and report results
3. **Check each layer** of the validation pyramid
4. **Identify issues** with severity levels
5. **Provide fixes** with specific examples
6. **Generate report** using template
7. **Give recommendation**: Ready / Needs work / Not ready
