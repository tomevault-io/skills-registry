# Production Deploy Skill

## Purpose
Complete production deployment checklist ensuring security, performance, and reliability. This skill guides you through the entire deployment lifecycle.

---

## Quick Navigation

Choose the stage you need:

### 🔍 Pre-Deployment
**Before you deploy** - Quality, security, and verification checks
- See [PRE-DEPLOY.md](PRE-DEPLOY.md) for complete checklist
- Code quality, security verification, database checks

### 🚀 Deployment
**Actual deployment steps** - Frontend, backend, database
- See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for step-by-step guide
- Release commits, tagging, platform deployment

### ✅ Post-Deployment
**After deployment** - Verification and validation
- See [POST-DEPLOY.md](POST-DEPLOY.md) for verification steps
- Smoke tests, E2E tests, performance checks

### 📊 Monitoring
**Ongoing operations** - Logs, alerts, performance
- See [MONITORING.md](MONITORING.md) for setup guide
- Supabase logs, error tracking, monitoring setup

### 🔄 Rollback
**Emergency procedures** - When things go wrong
- See [ROLLBACK.md](ROLLBACK.md) for rollback steps
- Frontend, database, and Edge Function rollbacks

---

## Quick Commands

### Pre-Deploy Check (5 min)
```bash
pnpm tsc && pnpm lint && pnpm build && npx playwright test
```
✅ All must pass before deployment

### Deploy All (10 min)
```bash
# Frontend
netlify deploy --prod

# Edge Functions
supabase functions deploy chat && \
supabase functions deploy pitch-deck-assistant && \
supabase functions deploy generate-pitch-deck

# Migrations
supabase db push
```

### Post-Deploy Verify (5 min)
```bash
# Check deployment
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Check Edge Functions
supabase functions list

# Check database
supabase db diff
```
