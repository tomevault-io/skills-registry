# Research Methodology for Documentation

This skill provides systematic approach to researching technical documentation using WebSearch and WebFetch tools.

## Core Principles

1. **Validate before research** - Ensure request is specific enough
2. **Check local first** - Look in `.claude/knowledge/` before searching
3. **Official sources priority** - Start with official docs
4. **Filter aggressively** - Extract only what's relevant to context
5. **Save for reuse** - Document findings in standard format

## Request Validation

A valid research request must contain three elements:

| Element | Example | Invalid |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Technology | "React", "Effect", "Prisma" | "JavaScript library" |
| Topic | "useEffect cleanup", "pipe operator" | "how it works" |
| Context | "fixing memory leak in subscription" | "learning" |

If any element is missing, return validation error and request clarification.

## Search Strategy

### Query Formulation

Build queries progressively:

```
Level 1 (Official): {technology} official documentation {topic}
Level 2 (Tutorial): {technology} {topic} tutorial example
Level 3 (Problem): {technology} {topic} {error-message} solution
```

### Source Hierarchy

Prioritize sources in this order:

1. **Official documentation** (always check first)
   - react.dev, docs.python.org, effect.website
   - GitHub official repos and examples

2. **Trusted secondary sources**
   - MDN Web Docs (web technologies)
   - DigitalOcean Community tutorials
   - Dev.to (high-quality articles only)
   - Stack Overflow (accepted answers)

3. **Avoid**
   - SEO-optimized content farms
   - Outdated tutorials (check dates)
   - AI-generated summaries
   - Forums without accepted solutions

### WebSearch Patterns

Reference `references/query-patterns.md` for specific query templates per technology domain.

## Filtering Results

### Relevance Criteria

Include information that:
- Directly addresses the stated context
- Provides actionable code examples
- Explains common pitfalls for the use case
- Is current (matches stated version or latest)

Exclude information that:
- Is tangentially related
- Covers advanced edge cases not needed
- Is deprecated or version-mismatched
- Duplicates what's already found

### Extraction Process

1. Scan search results for relevance
2. Open 2-3 most promising sources
3. Extract specific sections, not entire pages
4. Verify code examples are complete
5. Note version compatibility

## Document Format

Save all knowledge files to `.claude/knowledge/` using the template in `references/document-template.md`.

### File Naming

Format: `{technology}-{topic}.md`

Examples:
- `react-useeffect-cleanup.md`
- `effect-pipe-operator.md`
- `prisma-relations.md`
- `nextauth-jwt-session.md`

Rules:
- All lowercase
- Hyphens between words
- Technology first, then topic
- No version numbers in filename

### Frontmatter Structure

Required fields in YAML frontmatter:
- `topic`: Descriptive title
- `technology`: Library/framework name
- `version`: Version researched (or "latest")
- `sources`: List of URLs used
- `created`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `context`: Original problem that triggered research

## Quality Checklist

Before saving knowledge document, verify:

- [ ] Request was properly validated
- [ ] Existing knowledge was checked first
- [ ] Official sources were consulted
- [ ] Content is specific to stated context
- [ ] Code examples are complete and tested
- [ ] Sources are cited
- [ ] File follows naming convention
- [ ] Frontmatter is complete

## Additional Resources

### Reference Files

- **`references/query-patterns.md`** - Technology-specific search query templates
- **`references/document-template.md`** - Complete knowledge document template

### Implementation Notes

This methodology is designed for Haiku model execution. Instructions are explicit and procedural to ensure consistent results across model capabilities.
