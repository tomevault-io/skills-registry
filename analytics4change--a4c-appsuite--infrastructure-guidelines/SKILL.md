# Infrastructure Guard Rails

Critical rules that prevent bugs in database migrations, RLS policies, and CQRS projections. For full guidance, templates, and reference, see `infrastructure/CLAUDE.md` and search `documentation/AGENT-INDEX.md` with keywords: `migration`, `rls`, `cqrs`, `projection`, `idempotency`, `supabase`, `observability`, `failed-events`, `correlation-id`.

---

## 1. Always Use `supabase migration new` CLI

**NEVER manually create migration files.** The CLI generates correct UTC timestamps. Hand-typed timestamps cause ordering errors that break CI/CD.

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT
cd infrastructure/supabase && supabase migration new feature_name

# ❌ WRONG — timestamp may conflict with deployed migrations
touch supabase/migrations/20251223120000_feature.sql
```

## 2. All SQL Must Be Idempotent

Every statement must be safe to run multiple times.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ...;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS policy_name ON table_name;
CREATE POLICY policy_name ON table_name USING (...);
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ...;
```

## 3. RLS on Every Table with Org Data

Every table containing organization-scoped data MUST have RLS enabled with JWT claims isolation.

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS tenant_isolation ON my_table;
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON my_table
  FOR ALL
  USING (org_id = (current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'org_id')::uuid);
ALTER TABLE my_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## 4. Frontend Queries via `api.` Schema RPC ONLY

**NEVER use direct table queries with PostgREST embedding across projections.** This violates CQRS and causes 406 errors.

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
await supabase.schema('api').rpc('list_users', { p_org_id: orgId })

// ❌ WRONG — re-normalizes denormalized projections
await supabase.from('users').select('..., user_roles_projection!inner(...)')
```

## 5. `domain_events` Is the Sole Audit Trail

There is NO separate audit table. All state changes are domain events. **Never create audit/log tables** — query `domain_events` instead.

## 6. Projection Handlers Must Use ON CONFLICT

CQRS projection handlers receive events that may replay. Handlers MUST be idempotent.

```sql
INSERT INTO my_projection (id, name, ...)
VALUES ((p_event.event_data->>'entity_id')::uuid, p_event.event_data->>'name', ...)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  name = EXCLUDED.name,
  updated_at = p_event.created_at;
```

## 7. Single Event Trigger — NEVER Create Per-Event-Type Triggers

All event routing goes through ONE `process_domain_event()` BEFORE INSERT trigger on `domain_events`. It dispatches by `stream_type` to router functions, which dispatch by `event_type` to individual handlers. **NEVER create additional triggers** with WHEN clauses filtering specific event types.

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT: Add CASE line to router
WHEN 'user.foo.created' THEN PERFORM handle_user_foo_created(p_event);

-- ❌ WRONG: Create per-event-type trigger
CREATE TRIGGER my_trigger AFTER INSERT ON domain_events
  WHEN (NEW.event_type = 'user.foo.created') ...
```

Also: handlers receive `domain_events` rows. Use `p_event.stream_id`, NOT `p_event.aggregate_id` (that column does not exist).

### 7b. Handler Reference Files — Always Read Before Writing

Before modifying ANY handler, router, or trigger function, **read the canonical reference file** at `infrastructure/supabase/handlers/<domain>/<function>.sql`. Copy the existing implementation into your migration and modify the copy — never rewrite from memory.

```
handlers/
├── trigger/           # 5 trigger function files (process_domain_event, etc.)
├── routers/           # 12 active router files (process_*_event)
├── user/              # 20 handler files
├── organization/      # 11 handler files
├── organization_unit/ # 5 handler files
├── rbac/              # 10 handler files
├── bootstrap/         # 3 handler files
└── invitation/        # 1 handler file
```

After creating a migration that changes a handler, **update the reference file** to match.

**Day Zero consolidation**: When creating a new baseline migration, copy unchanged handler/router/trigger functions verbatim from reference files into the new baseline. Only rewrite functions that were modified in post-baseline migrations. See [Day 0 Migration Guide](../../../../documentation/infrastructure/guides/supabase/DAY0-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md#handler-reference-files).

### Choosing the Event Processing Pattern

Two patterns exist. Choose based on what the handler needs to do:

| Need | Pattern | Mechanism |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Update projection table | **Synchronous** | BEFORE INSERT trigger → router → handler |
| Send email, call API, start workflow | **Async** | AFTER INSERT trigger → pg_notify → Temporal |
| Both projection + side effect | **Hybrid** | BEFORE handler for projection + AFTER trigger for async |

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT: Projection update via synchronous handler
WHEN 'user.phone.added' THEN PERFORM handle_user_phone_added(p_event);

-- ✅ CORRECT: Async workflow via AFTER trigger + pg_notify
-- (for email, DNS, webhooks — NOT for projection updates)
CREATE TRIGGER notify_workflow_trigger AFTER INSERT ON domain_events
  FOR EACH ROW WHEN (NEW.event_type = 'organization.bootstrap.initiated')
  EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_workflow_worker();

-- ❌ WRONG: External I/O in a synchronous trigger handler
-- (blocks the transaction, no retry on failure)
```

**Full guide**: `documentation/infrastructure/patterns/event-processing-patterns.md`

## 8. Router ELSE Must RAISE EXCEPTION, Not WARNING

Routers must raise an EXCEPTION for unmatched event types, not a WARNING. Warnings are invisible — exceptions are caught by `process_domain_event()` and recorded in `processing_error`, visible in the admin dashboard.

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT: Exception caught and recorded
ELSE
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'Unhandled event type "%" in process_user_event', p_event.event_type
    USING ERRCODE = 'P9001';

-- ❌ WRONG: Warning is invisible, event marked as "processed"
ELSE
  RAISE WARNING 'Unknown user event type: %', p_event.event_type;
```

If an event type intentionally has no handler, add an explicit no-op CASE:
```sql
WHEN 'some.audit_only.event' THEN NULL;  -- No projection needed
```

## 9. API Functions Must NEVER Write Projections Directly

All projection updates go through event handlers. API functions emit events; handlers update projections.

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT: Emit event, let handler update projection
PERFORM api.emit_domain_event(
  p_stream_type := 'invitation', p_stream_id := p_id,
  p_event_type := 'invitation.revoked', p_event_data := ...);

-- ❌ WRONG: Direct projection write (no audit trail, breaks replay)
UPDATE invitations_projection SET status = 'revoked' WHERE id = p_id;

-- ❌ WRONG: Dual write (event + direct write in same function)
UPDATE organizations_projection SET direct_care_settings = v_settings;
PERFORM api.emit_domain_event(...);  -- handler also does the UPDATE
```

## 10. Event Metadata Must Include Audit Fields

Every domain event MUST include `user_id` and `reason` in metadata for audit compliance.

```sql
-- Verify audit fields in events
SELECT event_type,
  event_metadata->>'user_id' as actor,
  event_metadata->>'reason' as reason
FROM domain_events
WHERE stream_id = '<resource_id>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## 11. Failed Event Monitoring

Check `processing_error` column on `domain_events` for failed projections. Use the admin API or RPC to retry:

- Dashboard: `/admin/events` shows failed events
- Retry: `SELECT api.retry_failed_event('<event_id>'::uuid)`
- Stats: `SELECT * FROM api.get_event_processing_stats()`
