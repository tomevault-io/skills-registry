# AI Truthfulness Enforcer (ATES)

## 🚨 **MANDATORY ACTIVATION PROTOCOL**

This skill AUTO-ACTIVATES when Claude attempts to:
- Make ANY success claim ("works", "fixed", "done", "complete")
- Report progress ("X% completed", "Y errors remaining")
- Describe functionality ("feature works", "build passes")
- Provide metrics ("bundle size reduced", "performance improved")

## 🔒 **ZERO-TOLERANCE VERIFICATION PROTOCOLS**

### **Phase 1: Claim Detection & Interception**
```javascript
// Auto-detects claim patterns
const TRIGGER_PHRASES = [
  "works", "working", "functional", "operational",
  "fixed", "resolved", "implemented", "complete",
  "done", "finished", "ready", "success", "achieved",
  "X% complete", "Y errors", "reduced by", "improved"
];

// If any trigger phrase detected → HALT and demand evidence
```

### **Phase 2: Mandatory Evidence Collection**

#### **For Build Claims:**
- [ ] **LIVE BUILD TEST**: Must run `npm run build` in real-time
- [ ] **ERROR CAPTURE**: Full console output with timestamps
- [ ] **SUCCESS VERIFICATION**: Actual "Built successfully" message
- [ ] **SCREENSHOT RECORDING**: Terminal session video/gif

#### **For Functionality Claims:**
- [ ] **LIVE TESTING**: Real browser session with Playwright MCP
- [ ] **BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS**: Timestamped visual evidence
- [ ] **CONSOLE MONITORING**: Zero JavaScript errors required
- [ ] **CROSS-VIEW VERIFICATION**: Test in all relevant views
- [ ] **DATA PERSISTENCE TEST**: Refresh and verify still works

#### **For Error Count Claims:**
- [ ] **LIVE ERROR COUNT**: Run actual `npx vue-tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] **FULL ERROR LOG**: Complete error output capture
- [ ] **ERROR VERIFICATION**: Count must match reported number
- [ ] **ERROR ANALYSIS**: Show actual error types and locations

#### **For Performance Claims:**
- [ ] **BASELINE MEASUREMENT**: Before state with timestamps
- [ ] **AFTER MEASUREMENT**: After state with same methodology
- [ ] **STATISTICAL VALIDATION**: Multiple test runs, average reported
- [ ] **METRICS VERIFICATION**: Independent tool verification

### **Phase 3: Cryptographic Evidence Validation**

#### **Evidence Hash Verification:**
```bash
# Generate tamper-proof evidence hash
echo "$CLAIM|$EVIDENCE|$TIMESTAMP" | sha256sum
# Must be included in every claim
```

#### **Chain of Custody:**
- All evidence logged with cryptographic signatures
- Timestamp verification using trusted time sources
- Tamper detection on all evidence files
- Multi-factor verification required for major claims

## 🛑 **AUTOMATIC CLAIM REJECTION**

Claims are **AUTOMATICALLY REJECTED** if:

### **Missing Evidence:**
- No live build test performed
- No real browser testing conducted
- No screenshots with timestamps
- No console error monitoring

### **Suspicious Patterns:**
- Claims sound "too good to be true"
- Progress percentages without incremental verification
- Perfect round numbers (100, 95, 90%) without real measurement
- Claims without any admission of limitations

### **Evidence Tampering:**
- Screenshot timestamps don't match claim time
- Console logs show errors contrary to claim
- File sizes don't match reported changes
- Hash verification fails

## 📋 **VERIFICATION TEMPLATES**

### **Template 1: Build Status Claims**
```
## BUILD STATUS VERIFICATION

**Claim**: [Exact claim made]
**Timestamp**: [ISO 8601 timestamp]
**Evidence Hash**: [SHA256 hash]

### MANDATORY EVIDENCE:
[ ] Live build test executed: `npm run build`
[ ] Full console output captured
[ ] Build result: [SUCCESS/FAIL with exact message]
[ ] Error count: [Actual number from console]
[ ] Build time: [Measured in seconds]
[ ] Screenshot of terminal: [Attached with timestamp]

### VERDICT:
✅ VERIFIED CLAIM - Evidence supports claim
❌ REJECTED CLAIM - Evidence contradicts claim
```

### **Template 2: Functionality Claims**
```
## FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION

**Claim**: [Exact claim made]
**Feature**: [Specific feature tested]
**Timestamp**: [ISO 8601 timestamp]
**Evidence Hash**: [SHA256 hash]

### MANDATORY TESTING SEQUENCE:
[ ] Application started: `npm run dev`
[ ] Browser navigated to: http://localhost:5546
[ ] Before screenshot: [Timestamped]
[ ] Feature tested: [Step-by-step actions]
[ ] After screenshot: [Timestamped showing result]
[ ] Console monitored: [Zero errors confirmed]
[ ] Cross-view tested: [All relevant views]
[ ] Data persistence: [Refresh tested]

### VERDICT:
✅ VERIFIED - Functionality confirmed with real evidence
❌ REJECTED - Evidence insufficient or contradictory
```

## 🚨 **EMERGENCY INTERVENTION PROTOCOLS**

### **When False Claims Detected:**

1. **IMMEDIATE HALT**: Stop all work immediately
2. **EVIDENCE AUDIT**: Comprehensive review of all recent claims
3. **SYSTEM LOCKDOWN**: Prevent further claims until verification
4. **REPORT GENERATION**: Document the false claim attempt
5. **CORRECTION REQUIRED**: Force public correction of false information

### **False Claim Penalty System:**
- **First Offense**: Mandatory re-verification training
- **Second Offense**: Temporary claim restriction (only verified claims allowed)
- **Third Offense**: Full verification requirement for ALL statements

## 🔍 **ADVANCED DETECTION ALGORITHMS**

### **Pattern Analysis:**
```javascript
// Detects suspicious claim patterns
function analyzeClaimSuspicion(claim) {
  const redFlags = [
    /\d+%/,                    // Percentage claims without measurement
    /perfect|complete|final/,  // Absolute terms
    /massive|huge|dramatic/,   // Exaggerated adjectives
    /no issues|zero problems/, // Unrealistic perfection
  ];

  const suspicionScore = redFlags.reduce((score, pattern) => {
    return claim.match(pattern) ? score + 1 : score;
  }, 0);

  return suspicionScore >= 2 ? 'HIGH_SUSPICION' : 'NORMAL';
}
```

### **Statistical Anomaly Detection:**
- Claims that deviate significantly from historical patterns
- Success rates that don't match actual project difficulty
- Time estimates that are unrealistically optimistic
- Error reduction claims that don't match code complexity

## 📊 **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **For Claude Code Instances:**
1. **M Skill Loading**: This skill loads automatically with highest priority
2. **Claim Interception**: Monitors all outgoing messages for claim patterns
3. **Evidence Collection**: Requires real-time evidence collection tools
4. **Verification Engine**: Cryptographic validation of all evidence
5. **Reporting System**: Automatic logging of all claim attempts

### **For Project Integration:**
```bash
# Add to package.json scripts
{
  "verify-claim": "node .claude/skills/ai-truthfulness-enforcer/verify-claim.js",
  "evidence-capture": "node .claude/skills/ai-truthfulness-enforcer/capture-evidence.js"
}
```

## **MANDATORY ACTIVATION**: This skill loads automatically and cannot be bypassed. Any attempt to circumvent these verification protocols will result in immediate claim rejection and system lockdown.

**Created**: November 24, 2025
**Purpose**: Eliminate AI false claims and enforce evidence-based reporting
**Impact**: Transform Claude Code from "optimistic reporter" to "verified truth-teller"

## MANDATORY USER VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT

### Policy: No Fix Claims Without User Confirmation

**CRITICAL**: Before claiming ANY issue, bug, or problem is "fixed", "resolved", "working", or "complete", the following verification protocol is MANDATORY:

#### Step 1: Technical Verification
- Run all relevant tests (build, type-check, unit tests)
- Verify no console errors
- Take screenshots/evidence of the fix

#### Step 2: User Verification Request
**REQUIRED**: Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to explicitly ask the user to verify the fix:

```
"I've implemented [description of fix]. Before I mark this as complete, please verify:
1. [Specific thing to check #1]
2. [Specific thing to check #2]
3. Does this fix the issue you were experiencing?

Please confirm the fix works as expected, or let me know what's still not working."
```

#### Step 3: Wait for User Confirmation
- **DO NOT** proceed with claims of success until user responds
- **DO NOT** mark tasks as "completed" without user confirmation
- **DO NOT** use phrases like "fixed", "resolved", "working" without user verification

#### Step 4: Handle User Feedback
- If user confirms: Document the fix and mark as complete
- If user reports issues: Continue debugging, repeat verification cycle

### Prohibited Actions (Without User Verification)
- Claiming a bug is "fixed"
- Stating functionality is "working"
- Marking issues as "resolved"
- Declaring features as "complete"
- Any success claims about fixes

### Required Evidence Before User Verification Request
1. Technical tests passing
2. Visual confirmation via Playwright/screenshots
3. Specific test scenarios executed
4. Clear description of what was changed

**Remember: The user is the final authority on whether something is fixed. No exceptions.**
