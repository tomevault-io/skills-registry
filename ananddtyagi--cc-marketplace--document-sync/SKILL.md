# Document Sync Skill for Claude Code

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive documentation synchronization by analyzing your actual codebase, tech stack, configuration, and architecture to ensure all documentation remains current and accurate. It operates on a "verify, never assume" principle, performing end-to-end comparisons against real code and dependencies to detect documentation drift automatically.

## Core Principles

- **Verify, Never Assume:** Documentation is only updated after end-to-end comparison against real, current code and dependencies
- **Deep System Introspection:** Checks languages, frameworks, APIs, DBs, config, code patterns, and deployment targets
- **Doc Trust Score:** Every doc gets a trust rating based on evidence found in the codebase and config files

## Quick Start

**Natural Language Commands:**
- "Run document sync analysis on my project"
- "Update docs so every API route matches the code"
- "Check if any doc mentions features no longer in the app"
- "List undocumented config variables"

**Slash Commands:**
- `/docs-sync` — Runs analysis and outputs a complete report on outdated/inaccurate sections
- `/docs-update-strict` — Suggests only changes verified by found code/config evidence
- `/docs-rewrite-missing` — Fills gaps for undocumented features based on live source
- `/docs-patch-pr` — Makes all doc changes as a PR, zero surprises

## Operation Workflow

### Phase 1: Full System Scan

Execute the system scanning script to analyze your codebase:

```bash
# Run comprehensive system scan
python3 .claude/skills/document-sync/scripts/system_scan.py
```

This phase automatically:
1. **Tech Stack Detection** - Parse `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, etc. for frameworks, DBs, and build tools
2. **Project Structure Analysis** - Map `src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, and `config/` directories for real usage
3. **Architecture Detection** - Identify data flows, auth methods, sync strategies, and cloud/on-prem deployment

**Key Outputs:** `system_state.json` and `code_features_report.md`

### Phase 2: Documentation Verification

Execute the documentation verification script:

```bash
# Verify all documentation against code
python3 .claude/skills/document-sync/scripts/verify_docs.py
```

This phase:
1. **Docs Content Inventory** - List all Markdown, docs/, and README files
2. **Technical Validation** - Cross-reference each doc claim with real code/config
3. **Relevance & Quality Scoring** - Rate every doc: current, needs update, obsolete, or missing

**Key Outputs:** `doc_verification_report.md` and `docs_update_plan.md`

### Phase 3: Automated or Assisted Document Updating

Based on the verification results, choose your update approach:

```bash
# Dry run - see what would change
python3 .claude/skills/document-sync/scripts/update_docs.py --mode=dry-run

# Suggest mode - get suggestions for review
python3 .claude/skills/document-sync/scripts/update_docs.py --mode=suggest

# Auto-update with backups
python3 .claude/skills/document-sync/scripts/update_docs.py --mode=auto-update
```

## Configuration

Create `.claude/document-sync-skill.yml` in your project root:

```yaml
mode: suggest  # suggest | dry-run | auto-update
protected_docs:
  - README.md
  - docs/security.md
review_required_for:
  - section removal
  - breaking doc changes
output_reports:
  - doc_verification_report.md
  - docs_update_plan.md
```

## Safety & Controls

- **Never deletes or rewrites without firm code evidence**
- **Always creates a diff and backup before change**
- **User sets conservatism level:** dry-run, suggest-only, or auto-update
- **All changes are traceable—committed separately with actionable summaries**

## Output Examples

**doc_verification_report.md**

| Doc Section         | Status     | Evidence Found                   | Action        |
|---------------------|------------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| `/docs/api.md` GET `/users`   | Current    | Endpoint in code (src/routes/)    | Keep          |
| `/docs/db-setup.md` PouchDB   | Outdated   | No mention in codebase            | Remove/Update |
| `/README.md` Feature X        | Missing    | Found in `src/feature-x.ts`       | Add details   |

**docs_update_plan.md**

- Remove obsolete DB doc: `/docs/db-setup.md` (no longer in code)
- Add section to `/README.md` for unlisted Feature X
- Rewrite `/docs/config.md` section on env vars (now using `.env.local`)
- Confirm all code-blocks in `/docs/usage.md` still run

## Resources

This skill includes specialized scripts and references for comprehensive document synchronization:

### scripts/
- **system_scan.py** - Comprehensive codebase analysis and tech stack detection
- **verify_docs.py** - Documentation verification and validation against code
- **update_docs.py** - Automated document updating with safety controls

### references/
- **tech_detection_patterns.md** - Patterns for identifying frameworks and technologies
- **doc_validation_rules.md** - Rules for validating documentation accuracy
- **update_templates.md** - Templates for common documentation updates

### assets/
- **report_templates/** - Markdown templates for verification and update reports
- **config_schemas/** - JSON schemas for configuration validation

## Safety Checklist

- [ ] Full project scan completed
- [ ] All doc claims matched to real code/config
- [ ] Backups created before overwriting docs
- [ ] No deletions/rewrites without clear code evidence
- [ ] All updates and removals require user review
- [ ] All code examples in docs validated with real source

## Success Metrics

- 100% doc claims match code/config truth
- 0 obsolete/incorrect references in doc set
- All new features in code are documented within 2 days
- Doc update effort reduced by >60% for every release

## MANDATORY USER VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT

### Policy: No Fix Claims Without User Confirmation

**CRITICAL**: Before claiming ANY issue, bug, or problem is "fixed", "resolved", "working", or "complete", the following verification protocol is MANDATORY:

#### Step 1: Technical Verification
- Run all relevant tests (build, type-check, unit tests)
- Verify no console errors
- Take screenshots/evidence of the fix

#### Step 2: User Verification Request
**REQUIRED**: Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to explicitly ask the user to verify the fix:

```
"I've implemented [description of fix]. Before I mark this as complete, please verify:
1. [Specific thing to check #1]
2. [Specific thing to check #2]
3. Does this fix the issue you were experiencing?

Please confirm the fix works as expected, or let me know what's still not working."
```

#### Step 3: Wait for User Confirmation
- **DO NOT** proceed with claims of success until user responds
- **DO NOT** mark tasks as "completed" without user confirmation
- **DO NOT** use phrases like "fixed", "resolved", "working" without user verification

#### Step 4: Handle User Feedback
- If user confirms: Document the fix and mark as complete
- If user reports issues: Continue debugging, repeat verification cycle

### Prohibited Actions (Without User Verification)
- Claiming a bug is "fixed"
- Stating functionality is "working"
- Marking issues as "resolved"
- Declaring features as "complete"
- Any success claims about fixes

### Required Evidence Before User Verification Request
1. Technical tests passing
2. Visual confirmation via Playwright/screenshots
3. Specific test scenarios executed
4. Clear description of what was changed

**Remember: The user is the final authority on whether something is fixed. No exceptions.**
