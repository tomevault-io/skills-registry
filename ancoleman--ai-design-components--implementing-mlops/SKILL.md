# MLOps Patterns

Operationalize machine learning models from experimentation to production deployment and monitoring.

## Purpose

Provide strategic guidance for ML engineers and platform teams to build production-grade ML infrastructure. Cover the complete lifecycle: experiment tracking, model registry, feature stores, deployment patterns, pipeline orchestration, and monitoring.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Designing MLOps infrastructure for production ML systems
- Selecting experiment tracking platforms (MLflow, Weights & Biases, Neptune)
- Implementing feature stores for online/offline feature serving
- Choosing model serving solutions (Seldon Core, KServe, BentoML, TorchServe)
- Building ML pipelines for training, evaluation, and deployment
- Setting up model monitoring and drift detection
- Establishing model governance and compliance frameworks
- Optimizing ML inference costs and performance
- Migrating from notebooks to production ML systems
- Implementing continuous training and automated retraining

## Core Concepts

### 1. Experiment Tracking

Track experiments systematically to ensure reproducibility and collaboration.

**Key Components:**
- Parameters: Hyperparameters logged for each training run
- Metrics: Performance measures tracked over time (accuracy, loss, F1)
- Artifacts: Model weights, plots, datasets, configuration files
- Metadata: Tags, descriptions, Git commit SHA, environment details

**Platform Comparison:**

**MLflow** (Open-source standard):
- Framework-agnostic (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Self-hosted or cloud-agnostic deployment
- Integrated model registry
- Basic UI, adequate for most use cases
- Free, requires infrastructure management

**Weights & Biases** (SaaS, collaboration-focused):
- Advanced visualization and dashboards
- Integrated hyperparameter optimization (Sweeps)
- Excellent team collaboration features
- SaaS pricing scales with usage
- Best-in-class UI

**Neptune.ai** (Enterprise-grade):
- Enterprise features (RBAC, audit logs, compliance)
- Integrated production monitoring
- Higher cost than W&B
- Good for regulated industries

**Selection Criteria:**
- Open-source requirement → MLflow
- Team collaboration critical → Weights & Biases
- Enterprise compliance (RBAC, audits) → Neptune.ai
- Hyperparameter optimization primary → Weights & Biases (Sweeps)

For detailed comparison and decision framework, see [references/experiment-tracking.md](references/experiment-tracking.md).

### 2. Model Registry and Versioning

Centralize model artifacts with version control and stage management.

**Model Registry Components:**
- Model artifacts (weights, serialized models)
- Training metrics (accuracy, F1, AUC)
- Hyperparameters used during training
- Training dataset version
- Feature schema (input/output signatures)
- Model cards (documentation, use cases, limitations)

**Stage Management:**
- **None**: Newly registered model
- **Staging**: Testing in pre-production environment
- **Production**: Serving live traffic
- **Archived**: Deprecated, retained for compliance

**Versioning Strategies:**

**Semantic Versioning for Models:**
- Major version (v2.0.0): Breaking change in input/output schema
- Minor version (v1.1.0): New feature, backward-compatible
- Patch version (v1.0.1): Bug fix, model retrained on new data

**Git-Based Versioning:**
- Model code in Git (training scripts, configuration)
- Model weights in DVC (Data Version Control) or Git-LFS
- Reproducibility via commit SHA + data version hash

For model lineage tracking and registry patterns, see [references/model-registry.md](references/model-registry.md).

### 3. Feature Stores

Centralize feature engineering to ensure consistency between training and inference.

**Problem Addressed:** Training/serving skew
- Training: Features computed with future knowledge (data leakage)
- Inference: Features computed with only past data
- Result: Model performs well in training but fails in production

**Feature Store Solution:**

**Online Feature Store:**
- Purpose: Low-latency feature retrieval for real-time inference
- Storage: Redis, DynamoDB, Cassandra (key-value stores)
- Latency: Sub-10ms for feature lookup
- Use Case: Real-time predictions (fraud detection, recommendations)

**Offline Feature Store:**
- Purpose: Historical feature data for training and batch inference
- Storage: Parquet files (S3/GCS), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery)
- Latency: Seconds to minutes (batch retrieval)
- Use Case: Model training, backtesting, batch predictions

**Point-in-Time Correctness:**
- Ensures no future data leakage during training
- Feature values at time T only use data available before time T
- Critical for avoiding overly optimistic training metrics

**Platform Comparison:**

**Feast** (Open-source, cloud-agnostic):
- Most popular open-source feature store
- Supports Redis, DynamoDB, Datastore (online) and Parquet, BigQuery, Snowflake (offline)
- Cloud-agnostic, no vendor lock-in
- Active community, growing adoption

**Tecton** (Managed, production-grade):
- Feast-compatible API
- Fully managed service
- Integrated monitoring and governance
- Higher cost, enterprise-focused

**SageMaker Feature Store** (AWS):
- Integrated with AWS ecosystem
- Managed online/offline stores
- AWS lock-in

**Databricks Feature Store** (Databricks):
- Unity Catalog integration
- Delta Lake for offline storage
- Databricks ecosystem lock-in

**Selection Criteria:**
- Open-source, cloud-agnostic → Feast
- Managed solution, production-grade → Tecton
- AWS ecosystem → SageMaker Feature Store
- Databricks users → Databricks Feature Store

For feature engineering patterns and implementation, see [references/feature-stores.md](references/feature-stores.md).

### 4. Model Serving Patterns

Deploy models for synchronous, asynchronous, batch, or streaming inference.

**Serving Patterns:**

**REST API Deployment:**
- Pattern: HTTP endpoint for synchronous predictions
- Latency: <100ms acceptable
- Use Case: Request-response applications
- Tools: Flask, FastAPI, BentoML, Seldon Core

**gRPC Deployment:**
- Pattern: High-performance RPC for low-latency inference

- Tools: Spark, Dask, Ray

**Streaming Inference:**
- Pattern: Real-time predictions on streaming data
- Latency: Milliseconds
- Use Case: Fraud detection, anomaly detection, real-time recommendations

- Production-grade, optimized for PyTorch models
- Less flexible for multi-framework use

**TensorFlow Serving** (TensorFlow official):
- TensorFlow-specific serving
- Production-grade, optimized for TensorFlow models
- Less flexible for multi-framework use

**Selection Criteria:**
- Kubernetes, advanced deployments → Seldon Core or KServe

- PyTorch-specific → TorchServe
- TensorFlow-specific → TensorFlow Serving
- Managed solution → SageMaker/Vertex AI/Azure ML

For model optimization and serving infrastructure, see [references/model-serving.md](references/model-serving.md).

### 5. Deployment Strategies

Deploy models safely with rollback capabilities.

**Blue-Green Deployment:**
- Two identical environments (Blue: current, Green: new)
- Deploy to Green, test, switch 100% traffic instantly
- Instant rollback (switch back to Blue)
- Trade-off: Requires 2x infrastructure, all-or-nothing switch

**Canary Deployment:**
- Gradual rollout to subset of traffic
- Route 5% → 10% → 25% → 50% → 100% over time
- Monitor metrics at each stage, rollback if degradation
- Trade-off: Complex routing logic, longer deployment time

**Shadow Deployment:**
- New model receives traffic but predictions not used
- Compare new model vs old model offline
- Zero risk to production
- Trade-off: Requires 2x compute, delayed feedback

**A/B Testing:**
- Split traffic between model versions
- Measure business metrics (conversion rate, revenue)
- Statistical significance testing
- Use Case: Optimize for business outcomes, not just ML metrics

**Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB):**
- Epsilon-greedy: Explore (try new models) vs Exploit (use best model)
- Thompson Sampling: Bayesian approach to exploration
- Use Case: Continuous optimization, faster convergence than A/B

**Selection Criteria:**
- Low-risk model → Blue-green (instant cutover)
- Medium-risk model → Canary (gradual rollout)
- High-risk model → Shadow (test in production, no impact)
- Business optimization → A/B testing or MAB

For deployment architecture and examples, see [references/deployment-strategies.md](references/deployment-strategies.md).

### 6. ML Pipeline Orchestration

6. Model Registration (push to registry if metrics pass thresholds)
7. Deployment (promote to staging/production)

**Continuous Training Pattern:**

- Data scientists, ease of use → Metaflow
- Software engineers, testing → Dagster
- Modern, simpler than Airflow → Prefect

### 7. Model Monitoring and Observability

Monitor production models for drift, performance, and quality.

**Data Drift Detection:**
- Definition: Input feature distributions change over time
- Impact: Model trained on old distribution, predictions degrade
- Detection Methods:
  - Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test: Compare distributions
  - Population Stability Index (PSI): Measure distribution shift
  - Chi-Square Test: For categorical features

- Alerting Thresholds:
  - P95 latency > 100ms → Alert
  - Error rate > 1% → Alert
  - Accuracy drop > 5% → Trigger retraining

**Business Metrics Monitoring:**

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: End-to-End ML Pipeline

Automate the complete ML workflow from data to deployment.

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. Data Validation (Great Expectations)
2. Feature Engineering (transform raw data)
3. Data Splitting (train/validation/test)
4. Model Training (with hyperparameter tuning)
5. Model Evaluation (accuracy, fairness, explainability)
6. Model Registration (push to MLflow registry)
7. Deployment (promote to staging/production)

**Architecture:**
```
Data Lake → Data Validation → Feature Engineering → Training → Evaluation
    ↓
Model Registry (staging) → Testing → Production Deployment
```

For implementation details and code examples, see [references/ml-pipelines.md](references/ml-pipelines.md#end-to-end).

### Pattern 2: Continuous Training

Automate model retraining based on drift detection.

**Workflow:**
1. Monitor production data for distribution changes
2. Detect data drift (KS test, PSI)
3. Trigger automated retraining pipeline
4. Validate new model (accuracy, fairness)
5. Deploy via canary strategy (5% → 100%)
6. Monitor new model performance
7. Rollback if metrics degrade

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Scheduled: Daily/weekly retraining
- Data drift: KS test p-value < 0.05
- Model drift: Accuracy drop > 5%
- Data volume: New training data exceeds threshold (10K samples)

For implementation details, see [references/ml-pipelines.md](references/ml-pipelines.md#continuous-training).

### Pattern 3: Feature Store Integration

Ensure consistent features between training and inference.

**Architecture:**
```
Offline Store (Training):
  Parquet/BigQuery → Point-in-Time Join → Training Dataset

Online Store (Inference):
  Redis/DynamoDB → Low-Latency Lookup → Real-Time Prediction
```

**Point-in-Time Correctness:**
- Training: Fetch features as of specific timestamps (no future data)
- Inference: Fetch latest features (only past data)
- Guarantee: Same feature logic in training and inference

For implementation details and code examples, see [references/feature-stores.md](references/feature-stores.md#integration).

### Pattern 4: Shadow Deployment Testing

Test new models in production without risk.

**Workflow:**
1. Deploy new model (v2) in shadow mode
2. v2 receives copy of production traffic
3. v1 predictions used for responses (no user impact)
4. Compare v1 and v2 predictions offline
5. Analyze differences, measure v2 accuracy
6. Promote v2 to production if performance acceptable

**Use Cases:**
- High-risk models (financial, healthcare, safety-critical)
- Need extensive testing before cutover
- Compare model behavior on real production data

For deployment architecture, see [references/deployment-strategies.md](references/deployment-strategies.md#shadow).

## Best Practices

1. **Version Everything:**
   - Code: Git commit SHA for reproducibility
   - Data: DVC or data version hash
   - Models: Semantic versioning (v1.2.3)
   - Features: Feature store versioning

2. **Automate Testing:**
   - Unit tests: Model loads, accepts input, produces output
   - Integration tests: End-to-end pipeline execution
   - Model validation: Accuracy thresholds, fairness checks

3. **Monitor Continuously:**
   - Data drift: Distribution changes over time
   - Model drift: Accuracy degradation
   - Performance: Latency, throughput, error rates

4. **Start Simple:**
   - Begin with MLflow + basic serving (BentoML)
   - Add complexity as needed (feature store, Kubeflow)
   - Avoid over-engineering (don't build Kubeflow for 2 models)

5. **Point-in-Time Correctness:**
   - Use feature stores to avoid training/serving skew
   - Ensure no future data leakage in training
   - Consistent feature logic in training and inference

6. **Deployment Strategies:**
   - Use canary for medium-risk models (gradual rollout)
   - Use shadow for high-risk models (zero production impact)
   - Always have rollback plan (instant switch to previous version)

7. **Governance:**
   - Model cards: Document model purpose, limitations, biases
   - Audit trails: Track all model versions, deployments, approvals
   - Compliance: EU AI Act, model risk management (SR 11-7)

8. **Cost Optimization:**
   - Quantization: Reduce model size 4x, inference speed 2-3x
   - Spot instances: Train on preemptible VMs (60-90% cost reduction)
   - Autoscaling: Scale inference endpoints based on load

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Notebooks in Production:**
- Never deploy Jupyter notebooks to production
- Use notebooks for experimentation only
- Production: Use scripts, Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines

❌ **Manual Model Deployment:**
- Automate deployment with CI/CD pipelines
- Use model registry stage transitions (staging → production)
- Eliminate human error, ensure reproducibility

❌ **No Monitoring:**
- Production models without monitoring will degrade silently
- Implement drift detection (data drift, model drift)
- Set up alerting for accuracy drops, latency spikes

❌ **Training/Serving Skew:**
- Different feature logic in training vs inference
- Use feature stores to ensure consistency
- Test feature parity before production deployment

❌ **Ignoring Data Quality:**
- Garbage in, garbage out (GIGO)
- Validate data schema, ranges, distributions
- Use Great Expectations for data validation

❌ **Over-Engineering:**
- Don't build Kubeflow for 2 models
- Start simple (MLflow + BentoML)
- Add complexity only when necessary (10+ models)

❌ **No Rollback Plan:**
- Always have ability to rollback to previous model version
- Blue-green, canary, shadow deployments enable instant rollback
- Test rollback procedure before production deployment
