# Navigation Patterns & Routing Implementation

## Purpose

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for implementing navigation systems across both frontend and backend applications. It covers client-side navigation patterns (menus, tabs, breadcrumbs) and routing (React Router, Next.js) as well as server-side route configuration (Flask, Django, FastAPI).

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Building primary navigation (top, side, mega menus)
- Implementing secondary navigation (breadcrumbs, tabs, pagination)
- Setting up client-side routing (React Router, Next.js)
- Configuring server-side routes (Flask, Django, FastAPI)
- Creating mobile navigation patterns (hamburger, bottom nav)
- Implementing keyboard-accessible navigation
- Building command palettes or search-driven navigation
- Creating multi-step wizards or steppers
- Ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for navigation

## Navigation Decision Framework

```
Information Architecture → Navigation Pattern

Flat (1-2 levels)      → Top Navigation
Deep (3+ levels)       → Side Navigation
E-commerce/Large       → Mega Menu
Linear Process         → Stepper/Wizard
Long Content          → Table of Contents
Power Users           → Command Palette
Multi-section Page    → Tabs
Large Data Sets       → Pagination
```

## Frontend Navigation Components

### Primary Navigation Patterns

**Top Navigation (Horizontal)**
- Best for shallow hierarchies, marketing sites
- 5-7 primary links maximum for cognitive load
- See `references/menu-patterns.md` for implementation

**Side Navigation (Vertical)**
- Best for deep hierarchies, admin panels, dashboards
- Supports multi-level nesting and collapsible sections
- See `references/menu-patterns.md` for sidebar patterns

**Mega Menu**
- Best for e-commerce, content-heavy sites
- Rich content with images and descriptions
- See `references/menu-patterns.md` for mega menu structure

### Secondary Navigation Components

**Breadcrumbs**
- Shows hierarchical path and current location
- Essential for deep sites and e-commerce
- See `references/navigation-components.md` for breadcrumb patterns

**Tabs**
- Content switching without page reload
- URL synchronization for bookmarking
- See `references/navigation-components.md` for tab implementation

**Pagination**
- For search results, product lists, articles
- Consider virtualization for performance
- See `references/navigation-components.md` for pagination patterns

### Client-Side Routing

**React Router (Industry Standard)**
- Type-safe routing with loader patterns
- Nested routes and lazy loading support
- See `references/client-routing.md` for React Router patterns

**Next.js App Router**
- File-based routing with RSC support
- Parallel and intercepting routes
- See `references/client-routing.md` for Next.js routing

## Backend Routing Patterns

### Python Web Frameworks

**Flask**
- Blueprint-based organization
- Route decorators and URL rules
- See `references/flask-routing.md` for Flask patterns

**Django**
- URL configuration with namespaces
- Path converters and regex patterns
- See `references/django-urls.md` for Django URL conf

**FastAPI**
- Router-based organization
- Path operations and dependencies
- See `references/fastapi-routing.md` for FastAPI routers

## Mobile Navigation

### Patterns for Touch Devices

**Hamburger Menu**
- Slide-out drawer for primary navigation
- See `references/menu-patterns.md` for mobile drawer

**Bottom Navigation**
- 3-5 primary actions, thumb-friendly
- See `references/menu-patterns.md` for bottom nav

**Tab Bar**
- Horizontal scrollable tabs with swipe
- Natural for mobile-first applications

## Accessibility Requirements

### Keyboard Navigation

```
Tab       → Move forward through links
Shift+Tab → Move backward through links
Enter     → Activate link/button
Space     → Activate button
Arrow keys → Navigate within menus
Escape    → Close dropdowns/modals
```

### ARIA Patterns

Essential ARIA attributes for accessible navigation:
- See `references/accessibility-navigation.md` for complete ARIA patterns
- Includes landmark roles, states, and properties
- Screen reader optimization techniques

### Focus Management

- Visible focus indicators (2px minimum, 3:1 contrast)
- Focus trap for modals and dropdowns
- Skip navigation link for keyboard users
- See `references/accessibility-navigation.md` for focus patterns

## Implementation Utilities

### Navigation Structure Management

Generate and validate navigation trees:
```bash
# Validate navigation structure
node scripts/validate_navigation_tree.js nav-config.json

# Generate breadcrumb trails
node scripts/calculate_breadcrumbs.js current-path
```

### Route Generation (Python)

Generate route configurations:
```bash
# Generate Flask/Django/FastAPI routes
python scripts/generate_routes.py --framework flask --config routes.yaml
```

## Code Examples

### Frontend Examples

For working navigation implementations:
- `examples/horizontal-menu.tsx` - Responsive top navigation
- `examples/tab-navigation.tsx` - Tabs with URL sync
- `examples/mobile-navigation.tsx` - Hamburger and drawer

### Backend Examples

For routing configuration:
- `examples/flask_routes.py` - Flask blueprint setup
- `examples/django_urls.py` - Django URL patterns
- `examples/fastapi_routes.py` - FastAPI router organization

## Navigation Configuration

For complex navigation structures, use the configuration schema:
- `assets/navigation-config-schema.json` - Navigation tree schema
- `assets/route-templates.json` - Common route patterns

Validate configurations before implementation using the validation script.

## Library Recommendations

### Frontend Routing

**React Router** is the recommended solution for React applications:
- Industry standard with excellent TypeScript support
- Built-in accessibility with NavLink active states
- See `references/library-comparison.md` for alternatives

### Component Libraries

For rapid development, consider:
- Headless UI libraries (Radix UI, React Aria)
- Accessible by default
- Work with any styling approach

## Progressive Enhancement

Build navigation that works without JavaScript:
- Server-rendered HTML navigation
- Progressive enhancement with client-side routing
- Fallback for JavaScript failures

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy load route components
- Prefetch navigation targets
- Use route-based code splitting
- Implement loading states for navigation

## Testing Navigation

Essential navigation tests:
- Keyboard navigation flow
- Screen reader announcements
- Mobile touch interactions
- Route parameter validation
- Deep linking functionality

## Next Steps

1. Analyze the information architecture
2. Select appropriate navigation pattern
3. Implement with accessibility first
4. Add progressive enhancement
5. Test across devices and assistive technologies
