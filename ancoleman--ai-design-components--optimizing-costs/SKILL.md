# Cost Optimization

## Purpose

Cloud cost optimization transforms uncontrolled spending into strategic resource allocation through the FinOps lifecycle: Inform, Optimize, and Operate. This skill provides decision frameworks for commitment-based discounts (Reserved Instances, Savings Plans), right-sizing strategies, Kubernetes cost management, and automated cost governance across multi-cloud environments.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke cost-optimization when:
- Reducing cloud spend by 15-40% through systematic optimization
- Implementing cost visibility dashboards and allocation tracking
- Establishing budget alerts and anomaly detection
- Optimizing Kubernetes resource requests and cluster efficiency
- Managing Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, or Committed Use Discounts
- Automating idle resource cleanup and right-sizing recommendations
- Setting up showback/chargeback models for internal teams
- Preventing cost overruns through CI/CD cost estimation (Infracost)
- Responding to finance team requests for cloud cost reduction

## FinOps Principles

### The FinOps Lifecycle

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  INFORM → OPTIMIZE → OPERATE (continuous loop)      │
│    ↓         ↓           ↓                          │
│ Visibility  Action   Automation                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Inform Phase:** Establish cost visibility
- Enable cost allocation tags (Owner, Project, Environment)
- Deploy real-time cost dashboards for engineering teams
- Integrate cloud billing data (AWS CUR, Azure Consumption API, GCP BigQuery)
- Set up Kubernetes cost monitoring (Kubecost, OpenCost)

**Optimize Phase:** Take action on cost drivers
- Purchase commitment-based discounts (40-72% savings)
- Right-size over-provisioned resources (target 60-80% utilization)
- Implement spot/preemptible instances for fault-tolerant workloads
- Clean up idle resources (unattached volumes, old snapshots)

**Operate Phase:** Automate and govern
- Budget alerts with cascading notifications (50%, 75%, 90%, 100%)
- Automated cleanup scripts for idle resources
- CI/CD cost estimation to prevent surprise increases
- Continuous monitoring with anomaly detection

### Core FinOps Principles

1. **Collaboration:** Cross-functional teams (finance, engineering, operations, product)
2. **Accountability:** Teams own the cost of their services
3. **Transparency:** All costs visible and understandable to stakeholders
4. **Optimization:** Continuous improvement of cost efficiency

For detailed FinOps maturity models and organizational structures, see `references/finops-foundations.md`.

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Commitment-Based Discounts

**Reserved Instances (RIs):** 40-72% discount for 1-3 year commitments
- **Standard RI:** Instance type locked, highest discount (60% for 3-year)
- **Convertible RI:** Flexible instance types, moderate discount (54% for 3-year)
- **Use for:** Databases (RDS, ElastiCache), stable production EC2 workloads

**Savings Plans:** Flexible compute commitments
- **Compute Savings Plans:** Applies to EC2, Fargate, Lambda (54% discount for 3-year)
- **EC2 Instance Savings Plans:** Tied to instance family (66% discount for 3-year)
- **Use for:** Workloads that change instance types or regions

**GCP Committed Use Discounts (CUDs):** 25-70% discount
- **Resource-based CUDs:** Commit to vCPU, memory, GPUs
- **Spend-based CUDs:** Commit to dollar amount (flexible)
- **Sustained Use Discounts:** Automatic 20-30% discount for sustained usage (no commitment)

**Decision Framework:**
```
Reserve when:
├─ Workload is production-critical (24/7 uptime required)
├─ Usage is predictable (stable baseline over 6+ months)
├─ Architecture is stable (unlikely to change instance types)
└─ Financial commitment acceptable (1-3 year lock-in)

Use On-Demand when:
├─ Development/testing environments
├─ Unpredictable spiky workloads
├─ Short-term projects (<6 months)
└─ Evaluating new instance types
```

For detailed commitment strategies and RI coverage analysis, see `references/commitment-strategies.md`.

### 2. Spot and Preemptible Instances

**Discount:** 70-90% off on-demand pricing (interruptible with 2-minute warning)

**Use Spot For:** CI/CD workers, batch jobs, ML training (with checkpointing), Kubernetes workers, data analytics
**Avoid Spot For:** Stateful databases, real-time services, long-running jobs without checkpointing

**Best Practices:**
- Diversify instance types and spread across Availability Zones
- Implement graceful shutdown handlers
- Auto-fallback to on-demand when capacity unavailable
- Kubernetes: Mix 70% spot + 30% on-demand nodes with taints/tolerations

### 3. Right-Sizing Strategies

**Target Utilization:** 60-80% average (leave headroom for spikes)

**Compute Right-Sizing:**
- Analyze actual CPU/memory utilization over 30+ days
- Downsize instances with <40% average utilization
- Consolidate underutilized workloads
- Switch instance families (compute-optimized vs. memory-optimized)

**Database Right-Sizing:**
- Analyze connection pool usage (max connections vs. allocated)
- Downgrade storage IOPS if utilization <50%
- Evaluate read replica necessity (can caching replace it?)
- Consider serverless options (Aurora Serverless, Azure SQL Serverless)

**Kubernetes Right-Sizing:**
- Set requests = average usage (not peak)
- Set limits = 2-3x requests (allow bursting)
- Use Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) for automated recommendations
- Identify pods with 0% CPU usage (candidates for consolidation)

**Storage Right-Sizing:**
- Delete unattached volumes (EBS, Azure Disks, GCP Persistent Disks)
- Delete old snapshots (>90 days, retention policy not required)
- Implement lifecycle policies (S3 Intelligent-Tiering, Azure Blob Lifecycle)
- Compress/deduplicate data

**Right-Sizing Tools:**
- **AWS Compute Optimizer:** ML-based EC2, Lambda, EBS recommendations
- **Azure Advisor:** VM rightsizing, reserved instance advice
- **GCP Recommender:** VM, disk, commitment recommendations
- **VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler):** Automated container resource requests

### 4. Kubernetes Cost Management

**Resource Requests and Limits:**
```yaml
# Set requests = average usage (enables efficient bin-packing)
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 500m        # 0.5 CPU cores (average usage)
    memory: 1Gi      # 1 GiB memory (average usage)
  limits:
    cpu: 1500m       # 1.5 CPU cores (3x requests, allows bursting)
    memory: 3Gi      # 3 GiB memory (3x requests)
```

**Namespace Quotas:** Prevent runaway resource consumption
- ResourceQuota: Limit total CPU/memory per namespace
- LimitRange: Default/max requests per pod
- PriorityClass: Ensure critical pods get resources

**Cluster Autoscaling:**
- Scale down idle nodes to reduce costs
- Scale-to-zero for dev clusters during off-hours
- Use multiple node pools (spot + on-demand mix)
- Set max node limits to prevent overspend

**Cost Visibility:**
- Deploy Kubecost or OpenCost for namespace-level cost tracking
- Allocate costs by labels (team, project, environment)
- Track idle cost (cluster capacity not allocated to workloads)
- Generate showback/chargeback reports

For detailed Kubernetes cost optimization patterns, see `references/kubernetes-cost-optimization.md`.

## Cost Visibility and Monitoring

### Tagging for Cost Allocation

**Required Tags:**
- `Owner` or `Team` - Responsible team/department
- `Project` or `Application` - Business unit or application name
- `Environment` - prod, staging, dev, test
- `CostCenter` - Finance cost center code

**Enable Cost Allocation Tags:**
- **AWS:** Activate tags in Cost Allocation Tags console
- **Azure:** Apply tags via Azure Policy enforcement
- **GCP:** Use labels on all resources, export to BigQuery

For comprehensive tagging strategies, see `references/tagging-for-cost-allocation.md`.

### Monitoring and Dashboards

**Native Cloud Tools:**
- **AWS Cost Explorer:** Analyze spending patterns, forecast costs
- **Azure Cost Management + Billing:** Budget tracking, cost analysis
- **GCP Cloud Billing:** BigQuery export for custom analysis

**Third-Party Platforms:**
- **Kubecost:** Kubernetes cost visibility and optimization
- **CloudZero:** Unit cost economics, anomaly detection
- **CloudHealth:** Multi-cloud cost management
- **Infracost:** Terraform cost estimation in CI/CD

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Total monthly cloud spend (trend over time)
- Cost per service/team/project (allocation accuracy)
- Unit cost metrics (cost per customer, cost per transaction)
- Reserved Instance/Savings Plan utilization (target >95%)
- Idle resource waste (target <5% of total spend)
- Budget variance (forecasted vs. actual)

### Budget Alerts and Anomaly Detection

**Cascading Budget Alerts:**
```
50% of budget  → Email to team lead (informational)
75% of budget  → Email + Slack to team (warning)
90% of budget  → Email + Slack + PagerDuty (urgent)
100% of budget → Automated shutdown (non-prod only) or escalation
```

**Anomaly Detection:** Alert on unexpected cost spikes
- >20% cost increase week-over-week
- >$500 unexpected daily cost spike
- New resource types (unusual spend patterns)

**Budget Granularity:**
- Organization-level (total cloud spend)
- Department-level (engineering, data, marketing)
- Project-level (per application/service)
- Environment-level (prod vs. dev/staging)

## Decision Frameworks

### Framework 1: Commitment Discount Decision Tree

```
Should we purchase Reserved Instances / Savings Plans?

STEP 1: Analyze Historical Usage (6-12 months)
├─ Identify steady-state baseline (minimum usage)
├─ Exclude spiky/seasonal workloads
└─ Calculate: (baseline usage) / (total usage) = commitment %

STEP 2: Choose Commitment Type
├─ RESERVED INSTANCES
│   ├─ Pros: Highest discount (up to 72%)
│   ├─ Cons: Instance type locked (unless convertible)
│   └─ Use for: Databases, stable production workloads
│
├─ SAVINGS PLANS
│   ├─ Pros: Flexible (across instance types, regions)
│   ├─ Cons: Slightly lower discount than RI
│   └─ Use for: Compute workloads, Lambda, Fargate
│
└─ COMMITTED USE DISCOUNTS (GCP)
    ├─ Resource-based: vCPU/memory commitments
    └─ Spend-based: Dollar amount commitments

STEP 3: Determine Commitment Period
├─ 1-year commitment
│   ├─ Lower discount (40-50%)
│   └─ Less risk if architecture changes
│
└─ 3-year commitment
    ├─ Higher discount (60-72%)
    └─ Only for mature, stable workloads

STEP 4: Monitor and Optimize
├─ Target >95% RI/Savings Plan utilization
├─ Sell unused RIs on AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace
└─ Adjust commitments quarterly based on usage trends
```

### Framework 2: Right-Sizing Priority Matrix

**Cost Impact vs. Effort:**

**High Impact, Low Effort (DO FIRST):**
- Idle resources (100% waste): Stopped instances, unattached volumes, old snapshots
- Unused NAT Gateways ($32/month each)
- Over-provisioned databases (<20% CPU for 30 days)
- Kubernetes pods with no resource requests set

**High Impact, Medium Effort (DO SECOND):**
- Over-provisioned compute (<40% CPU/memory for 30 days)
- Lambda functions with max memory >2x used memory
- Storage optimization (S3 Intelligent-Tiering, gp3 vs. gp2)

**Low Impact, High Effort (DO LAST):**
- Application code optimization (requires profiling, refactoring)
- Architecture redesign (serverless migration, multi-region optimization)

**Weekly Optimization Routine:**
1. Delete idle resources (automated script)
2. Review top 10 cost drivers (manual analysis)
3. Right-size 3-5 instances/week (incremental approach)
4. Monitor impact (cost trend over 4 weeks)

### Framework 3: Spot vs. On-Demand Decision

```
Should this workload use Spot/Preemptible instances?

├─ Is the workload fault-tolerant?
│   ├─ NO → Use On-Demand
│   └─ YES → Continue
│
├─ Is the workload stateless (or has checkpointing)?
│   ├─ NO → Use On-Demand (data loss risk)
│   └─ YES → Continue
│
├─ Can the workload handle interruptions gracefully?
│   ├─ NO → Use On-Demand
│   └─ YES → Continue
│
└─ Workload Type Assessment:
    ├─ Batch Jobs / CI/CD → ✅ Use Spot (70-90% savings)
    ├─ ML Training → ✅ Use Spot (with checkpointing)
    ├─ Kubernetes Workers → ✅ Use Spot (mixed with on-demand)
    ├─ Production API Servers → ⚠️ Mixed fleet (70% spot, 30% on-demand)
    ├─ Databases → ❌ Use On-Demand (or Reserved)
    └─ Real-time Services → ❌ Use On-Demand (or Reserved)
```
