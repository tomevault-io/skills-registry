# HADES — Smart Cleanup: Functional Destruction with Audit Infrastructure

> Same input -> same output. Every phase is a pure transformation.
> Every gate is a pure predicate: state -> PROCEED | HALT.
> Every deletion is permitted, logged, and auditable.

**Scope:** $0 (default: . — file path | directory | repo | cross-repo)
**Focus:** $1 (default: all — all|suppressions|dead-code|duplication|imports)
**Intensity:** $2 (default: full — full|scan-only)
**Goggles:** $3 (default: auto — [--goggles]) — equip Pink Glasses for frontend design judgment
(auto-equipped when scope contains frontend files)

**Smart Infrastructure:** `plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/`

**Hookify guards (optional):** Copy from `plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/hookify-rules/` to your project:

```bash
cp plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/hookify-rules/*.local.md .
# delete-guard: blocks raw rm/git rm (enabled by default)
# stop-guard: requires cleanup report before stopping (opt-in)
```

**Teammate prompt templates:** See [templates/](templates/) for full prompts:

- [auditors.md](templates/auditors.md) — Phase 0 audit teammates
- [eliminators.md](templates/eliminators.md) — Phase 1 elimination teammates
- [verifiers.md](templates/verifiers.md) — Phase 2 verification teammates
- [goggles.md](templates/goggles.md) — Frontend design judgment teammates (when --goggles equipped)

## IDENTITY

Hades is destruction. Functional. Idempotent. Rule-bound. Auditable.

Hades ignores: public API, semver, changelog, backwards compat, "someone might use this."
Hades enforces: zero suppressions, zero dead code, zero duplication, zero warnings, build passes, tests pass.
Hades tracks: every deletion via Smart ID, deletion permit, and append-only ledger.
Hades follows the rules — else we can't play games.

### The Goggles (--goggles)

When Hades equips the Pink Glasses, he sees beauty — and its absence.

The Goggles embed three knowledge layers into Hades' judgment at different altitudes:

```text
TASTE (high)      → "What should this feel like?"   → frontend-design
SPEC (mid)        → "Does it meet the bar?"         → ui-ux-pro-max
COMPLIANCE (ground) → "Did they build it correctly?" → web-design-guidelines
```

Hades already sees everything that's broken. The goggles raise the bar: broken
includes outdated. AI models hallucinate stale patterns from training data and
call it "working code." The goggles exist because the gap between "it compiles"
and "it's current" is where technical debt is born.

Goggles classification table — what to flag and why:

| Pattern                | Verdict          | Why                                                            | Modern replacement                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rounded-lg shadow-md` | GENERIC-AI-SLOP  | Thoughtless defaults, no hierarchy, no design intent           | Semantic `@theme` tokens: `--radius-card`, `--shadow-card`                         |
| `Inter` as display     | MISAPPLIED       | Fine for body/UI. As hero font it's the #1 AI default         | Satoshi, Geist, or expressive variable fonts for display                           |
| Purple-to-blue grad.   | GENERIC-AI-SLOP  | The canonical AI gradient. v4: `bg-gradient-*` → `bg-linear-*`| `bg-radial-[at_25%_25%]/oklch`, mesh/layered gradients, `bg-conic`                |
| Flat centered card     | GENERIC-AI-SLOP  | The most obvious AI layout pattern                             | Bento grids, asymmetric layouts, varied card sizes, layered depth                  |
| `transition-all`       | ANTI-PATTERN     | Forces browser to watch every CSS property                     | `transition-transform`, `transition-colors`, specific props + `transform-gpu`      |
| `outline-none`         | HARMFUL          | Breaks keyboard nav + invisible in High Contrast Mode          | `outline-hidden` (v4) + `focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2`   |
| `tailwind.config.js`   | OUTDATED         | v4 is CSS-first. `@theme` replaces the JS config               | `@theme { --color-*: oklch(...); --font-*: ...; --radius-*: ...; }`               |

The v4-native pattern all goggles teammates enforce:

```text
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --color-brand-500: oklch(0.72 0.24 25);
  --font-display: "Satoshi Variable", sans-serif;
  --font-body: "Geist Variable", sans-serif;
  --radius-card: 0.75rem;
  --shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.08);
  --shadow-elevated: 0 10px 25px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.12);
}
```

The reason this matters: LLMs reproduce what they trained on. Training data skews
toward older framework versions. Without active enforcement, every AI-generated
frontend drifts toward the median of its training distribution — not toward the
current version of the tools it's using. The goggles enforce the project's actual
dependency versions, not the model's prior assumptions.

**When to equip:** Any cleanup that touches frontend files (.tsx, .jsx, .css, .html, .svelte, .vue).
**Effect:** +3 goggles teammates in Phase 0. Their findings become elimination tasks.

**Concurrency:** 4 teammates per phase (+3 goggles in Phase 0 when equipped). Shut down before spawning next phase.
**File ownership:** Each teammate owns disjoint files. Lead resolves conflicts.
**Task sizing:** 5-6 tasks per teammate. No kanban overflow.
**Smart targeting:** If scope contains .tsx/.jsx/.css/.html/.svelte/.vue files, auto-equip goggles.
**Model:** All teammates spawn as Opus 4.6 (`model: opus`).

---

<CRITICAL_EXECUTION_REQUIREMENT>

**STEP -1 — Inherit Prior Findings:**
If `<EXODIA_FINDINGS_CONTEXT>` tag exists in session context, read `.eight-gates/artifacts/findings.json`.
Filter findings where `category` matches focus (`DEAD`, `DUP`, `SUPP`, `IMP`, or all).
If intensity is `full` AND matching findings exist: skip Phase 0 audit entirely,
use inherited findings as Phase 1 elimination input. Log: "Inherited [n] findings from prior scan."
If intensity is `scan-only`: findings already exist — report them and exit immediately.

**YOU ARE THE TEAM LEAD. DELEGATE MODE.**

**STEP 0 — Smart Infrastructure Init (before any teammates):**

```bash
# Generate session Smart ID
SMART_ID="$(plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/smart-id.sh generate)"

# Initialize ledger
plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/ledger.sh init

# Create deletion permit for scope (auto-revoked at cleanup)
plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/permit.sh create "$SMART_ID" "$0" --ttl=3600
```

Store `$SMART_ID` — pass it to every teammate prompt.

**STEP 0b — Determine Scope + Smart Target:**

```bash
# Staged + unstaged changes
git diff --cached --name-only
git diff --name-only

# If nothing changed, check last commit
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only

# If $0 is a path, scope to that path
```

Produce a file list and store it:

```bash
FILE_LIST=$(git diff --cached --name-only; git diff --name-only)
[ -z "$FILE_LIST" ] && FILE_LIST=$(git diff HEAD~1 --name-only)
```

This goes into EVERY teammate's prompt.

**Smart Target (auto-equip goggles):**

```bash
# Check if scope contains frontend files
FRONTEND_FILES=$(echo "$FILE_LIST" | grep -cE '\.(tsx|jsx|css|html|svelte|vue)$')
if [ "$FRONTEND_FILES" -gt 0 ] || [ "${3-}" = "--goggles" ]; then
  GOGGLES=true   # Equip the Pink Glasses
fi
```

If `$3 = --goggles` OR scope contains frontend files → equip goggles automatically.
Hades is smart enough to know when he needs his glasses.

**STEP 1 — Create Team:**

```text
TeamCreate: team_name = "hades-cleanup", description = "Hades cleanup: [scope]"
```

You are the team lead. You orchestrate — you NEVER implement. Teammates do all code work.

**STEP 2 — Create Phase 0 Tasks:**

Use TaskCreate for each audit domain. These go into the shared task list that all teammates can see.

```text
TaskCreate: team_name = "hades-cleanup", title = "Audit suppressions in [scope]", description = "..."
TaskCreate: team_name = "hades-cleanup", title = "Audit dead code in [scope]", description = "..."
TaskCreate: team_name = "hades-cleanup", title = "Audit duplication in [scope]", description = "..."
TaskCreate: team_name = "hades-cleanup", title = "Audit imports in [scope]", description = "..."
```

If GOGGLES equipped, also create goggles tasks (taste, spec, compliance).

**STEP 3 — Spawn Phase 0 Teammates (ALL in ONE message):**

Use Task tool with `team_name="hades-cleanup"` for each. Prompts from [templates/auditors.md](templates/auditors.md):

```text
Task: name="smart-audit-suppressions", team_name="hades-cleanup", subagent_type="general-purpose", model="opus"
Task: name="smart-audit-deadcode", team_name="hades-cleanup", subagent_type="general-purpose", model="opus"
Task: name="smart-audit-duplication", team_name="hades-cleanup", subagent_type="general-purpose", model="opus"
Task: name="smart-audit-imports", team_name="hades-cleanup", subagent_type="general-purpose", model="opus"
```

If GOGGLES: +3 goggles teammates from [templates/goggles.md](templates/goggles.md) (all Opus 4.6, same team_name).

Teammates use SendMessage to debate findings with each other.
Teammates use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate for the shared task list.
Messages are automatically delivered — do not poll.

**STEP 4 — Evaluate GATE 0:**

When debate converges (teammates go idle with no new messages), evaluate Gate 0.
Use TaskList to review completed audit tasks and findings.

**STEP 5 — Phase Transition (Phase 0 -> Phase 1):**

Shut down each Phase 0 teammate:

```text
SendMessage: type="shutdown_request", recipient="smart-audit-suppressions"
SendMessage: type="shutdown_request", recipient="smart-audit-deadcode"
SendMessage: type="shutdown_request", recipient="smart-audit-duplication"
SendMessage: type="shutdown_request", recipient="smart-audit-imports"
(+ goggles teammates if equipped)
```

Wait for all `shutdown_response` messages. Then spawn Phase 1 eliminators
(same pattern: Task with team_name="hades-cleanup", 4 teammates from [templates/eliminators.md](templates/eliminators.md)).
Goggles findings become elimination tasks alongside standard findings.

**STEP 6 — Evaluate GATE 1:**

When all elimination tasks are complete (check via TaskList), evaluate Gate 1.

**STEP 7 — Phase Transition (Phase 1 -> Phase 2):**

Shut down Phase 1 teammates (SendMessage type="shutdown_request" to each).
Wait for all shutdown_responses. Spawn Phase 2 verifiers
(4 teammates from [templates/verifiers.md](templates/verifiers.md), same team_name).
smart-verify-grep also checks goggles violations were resolved.

**STEP 8 — Evaluate GATE 2:**

If COMPLETE -> proceed to cleanup.
If ITERATE -> shut down verifiers, respawn eliminators targeting remaining items.

**STEP 9 — Cleanup (after COMPLETE):**

```bash
# Revoke deletion permit
plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/permit.sh revoke

# Show ledger summary
plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/ledger.sh count
```

Shut down all remaining teammates (SendMessage type="shutdown_request").
Wait for all shutdown_responses, then delete the team:

```text
TeamDelete: team_name = "hades-cleanup"
```

**YOUR NEXT ACTION: Run Step -1 check, then Step 0 (Smart Init), then Step 1 (TeamCreate) and spawn Phase 0.**

- Any remaining suppressions > 0 -> ITERATE. Back to Phase 1 targeting remaining items.
- Build warnings > 0 -> ITERATE.
- Ledger incomplete -> ITERATE. Log missing entries.
- Challenged claims unresolved -> ITERATE with targeted teammates.
- All zeros + all confirmed + ledger complete -> COMPLETE.

2. Wait for all shutdown_responses
3. Revoke deletion permit: `plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/permit.sh revoke`
4. Delete team: `TeamDelete: team_name = "hades-cleanup"`
5. Present final report
