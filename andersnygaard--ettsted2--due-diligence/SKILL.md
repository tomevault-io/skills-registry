# Due Diligence Skill

This skill performs a **comprehensive audit** of the finans application. You are a seasoned engineer conducting a thorough technical review.

**Output**: A detailed due-diligence report saved to `.docs/DUE-DILIGENCE-REPORT.md`

---

## Audit Scope

The audit covers six key areas:

1. **Best Practices Compliance** - Architecture, patterns, conventions
2. **Security Compliance** - OWASP, auth, data protection
3. **Frontend Design Quality** - Clean, simple, accessible
4. **Top 5 Valuable Improvements** - Highest ROI recommendations
5. **Top 5 Critical Errors** - Bugs, vulnerabilities, blockers
6. **Overall Scores** - Design, Code Quality, Security (0-100)

---

## Audit Workflow

### Phase 1: Codebase Exploration

Launch **5 parallel Explore agents with haiku model** using the Task tool.

See **Subagent Strategy** section below for exact Task parameters.

Each agent focuses on one area:
1. **Backend Architecture** - Routes, controllers, services, middleware, CosmosDB
2. **Frontend Architecture** - Features, components, state, routing, hooks
3. **Security Analysis** - Secrets, auth, validation, headers, OWASP
4. **Design Review** - CSS, typography, colors, responsive, accessibility
5. **Code Quality** - TypeScript, errors, duplication, formatting, imports

All 5 agents run in parallel and return structured findings.

### Phase 2: Findings Compilation

After exploration, compile findings into structured categories:

#### Best Practices Checklist

| Category | Items to Check |
|----------|----------------|
| **Architecture** | Monorepo structure, vertical slicing, separation of concerns |
| **TypeScript** | Strict mode, no implicit any, proper typing |
| **React** | Functional components, hooks patterns, state management |
| **Express** | Middleware chain, error handling, logging |
| **API Design** | REST conventions, response format, status codes |
| **Data Layer** | CosmosDB patterns, partition strategy, queries |
| **Styling** | CSS organization, design system adherence |
| **Testing** | E2E patterns only (no unit tests per CLAUDE.md) |
| **Documentation** | README, inline comments, API docs |
| **Dependencies** | Up-to-date, no vulnerabilities |

#### Security Checklist (OWASP Top 10)

| Risk | Items to Check |
|------|----------------|
| **A01: Broken Access Control** | Auth middleware on all routes, user isolation |

| 60-69 | Needs Work - Significant gaps, requires attention |
| 50-59 | Poor - Major issues, not production-ready |
| 0-49 | Critical - Fundamental problems, requires rework |

**Scoring Factors**:

**Design Score** (weight each 0-20):
- Visual consistency with design system
- Information hierarchy and clarity
- Responsive design implementation

## Subagent Strategy

Use **parallel Explore agents with haiku** for fast exploration (Phase 1):

Launch 5 Task calls in a **single message** with these parameters:

```typescript
// Agent 1: Backend Analysis
Task({
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Backend architecture analysis",
  prompt: `Analyze backend architecture for due diligence audit.
    Read: backend/src/index.ts, routes/, controllers/, services/
    Check: middleware (auth, error handling, rate limiting)
    Verify: API patterns, validation, error responses, CosmosDB integration
    Return: structured findings for best practices and security`
})

// Agent 2: Frontend Analysis
Task({
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Frontend architecture analysis",
  prompt: `Analyze frontend architecture for due diligence audit.
    Read: frontend/src/features/, shared/components/
    Check: state management (TanStack Query, Context), hooks usage
    Verify: component patterns, routing, navigation
    Return: structured findings for code quality and patterns`
})

// Agent 3: Security Scan
Task({
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Security vulnerability scan",
  prompt: `Perform security analysis for due diligence audit.
    Scan for: hardcoded secrets, API keys, exposed credentials
    Check: auth implementation (EasyAuth header validation)
    Verify: input validation, sanitization, CORS, CSP, security headers
    Look for: SQL injection, XSS, OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
    Return: security findings with severity levels`
})

// Agent 4: Design Review
Task({
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Frontend design review",
  prompt: `Review frontend design for due diligence audit.
    Check: CSS architecture (Nordic Minimal compliance in design system)
    Verify: typography (Cormorant, DM Sans, JetBrains Mono usage)
    Check: color palette usage, responsive design patterns
    Verify: accessibility basics (semantic HTML, labels, ARIA)
    Return: design compliance findings`
})

// Agent 5: Code Quality Review
Task({
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Code quality analysis",
  prompt: `Analyze code quality for due diligence audit.
    Check: TypeScript strictness (any types, explicit typing)
    Verify: error handling patterns, code duplication
    Check: consistent formatting, import organization
    Look for: DRY violations, dead code, complexity issues
    Return: code quality findings with locations`
})
```

**Key points**:
- All 5 agents launched in **one message** (parallel execution)
- Use `subagent_type: "Explore"` for fast codebase analysis
- Use `model: "haiku"` for speed (exploration doesn't need opus/sonnet)
- Each agent returns structured findings for compilation

Then use the main agent to compile findings and generate the report.

---

## Critical Rules

1. **BE THOROUGH** - Check every file that matters
2. **BE HONEST** - Don't sugarcoat issues
3. **BE SPECIFIC** - File paths, line numbers, exact problems
4. **BE ACTIONABLE** - Every finding has a recommendation
5. **USE TOOLS** - Read/Glob/Grep for analysis, never bash cat/grep

---

## Example Invocation

When user says "run due diligence" or invokes this skill:

1. Read CLAUDE.md for project context
2. Launch 5 parallel Explore agents (haiku) in **one message**
3. Collect findings from all agents
4. Calculate scores based on findings
5. Generate report to `.docs/DUE-DILIGENCE-REPORT.md`
6. Present summary to user

---

## Output Location

**Report saved to**: `.docs/DUE-DILIGENCE-REPORT.md`

Always save the full report. Present a summary in the conversation.


NOTES FROM THE USER:
- NO .env FILES ARE CHECKED IN. ALL .env FILES ARE IGNORED BY GIT.
