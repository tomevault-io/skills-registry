**When to Use**: Automatically activate this skill whenever:
- User mentions "Joplin" in their request
- User requests markdown artifacts for note-taking
- User requests technical rundowns, summaries, or research documents
- User explicitly requests content following their markdown preferences

**Response**: When returning formatted artifacts:
- Refer to the generated content
- Do not describe formatting rules and other details followed, unless more substantial changes to content have been made

## Core Formatting Principles

### Spacing and Line Break Rules
1. **Heading Spacing**:
   - Two carriage returns (blank lines) BEFORE h2 headings
   - One carriage return (blank line) BEFORE all other headings (h3, h4, h5, h6)
   - CRITICAL: NO extra blank lines after headings
2. **Horizontal Rules**:
   - Remove any extra horizontal rules ("---") under headings other than H3. These are handled by CSS.
   - **NEVER use "---" after h1 or h2 headings** (they already have border-bottom in CSS)
   - **NO other heading levels** (h4, h5, h6) should have horizontal rules.
3. **Content Spacing**:
   - NO extra blank lines within sections unless separating fundamentally different concepts
   - CLI commands follow the same compact formatting as other content
4. **General Rule**: If in doubt, use less spacing rather than more

### Heading Hierarchy & Typography
1. **h1 Headings** - Bitter Serif, 2rem, border-bottom
   - Rarely used. Reserve for document title only in special cases
   - Already has border-bottom in CSS, so NEVER add "---" after it
   - Usually preceded by `>[toc]` tag at start of document if the document is more that 5 pages long
2. **h2 Headings** - Bitter Serif, 1.8rem, border-bottom
   - Main document sections
   - Already has border-bottom in CSS, so NEVER add "---" after it
3. **h3 Headings** - Bitter Serif, 1.5rem
   - Primary section dividers
   - ONLY heading level that gets "---" separator underneath
   - This is where major content sections begin
4. **h4 Headings** - Bitter Serif, 1.25rem
   - Sub-sections within h3 sections
   - Regular markdown, no special formatting
   - Use for subsections within a larger section
5. **h5 Headings** - Bitter Serif, 1.25em
   - Detail-level sections
   - Regular markdown, no special formatting
   - Use for even smaller section headings
6. **h6 Headings** - Sans-serif, 0.9rem, weight 600
   - Rarely used
   - For emphasis or 1-paragraph comments
   - Often used for sub-labels within lists (e.g., `###### [GitHub: Repository](url)`)

### Example Structure:
```markdown
>[toc]
# Main Document Title
First paragraph content starts immediately after heading. Note that h2 already has a border-bottom in CSS, so NO horizontal rule is added.

## Major Section Header
### Major Sub-Section
---
Content starts immediately after the separator line. This is the ONLY heading level that may sometimes get the horizontal rule separator. The presence or absence of "---" should be consistent throughout the document.

<figure class="img-center">
    <img src=":/af5fcef1a0234a36b27c35b519d52e7c" alt="Description">
	<figcaption>Figure 1. This is a comment for an example of how an image should be formatted.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Subsection
Content starts immediately after heading (one blank line before heading). No horizontal rule for h4.

##### Detail Section
More detailed content here. No horizontal rule for h5.

###### Lower-level Details or Paragraph Header
More content.

### Next Major Sub-Section
Content starts immediately after the separator line. This is the ONLY heading level that may sometimes get the horizontal rule separator.


## Next Major Section
There may be an introductory paragraph here. Then content continues with another section.
```


## Table of Contents

**Format**: Always use blockquote syntax with `>[toc]` at the start of documents
```markdown
>[toc]
# Main Title of Document
## First Major Section
```

**When to Use**:
- Always include for documents longer than 4-5 pages long
- Place at the very beginning of the document
- Single blank line after `>[toc]` before first h2 heading

```


## Formatting Special Elements

### Links
**Format**: Always as markdown links with descriptive text
```markdown
- [Official Documentation](https://docs.example.com)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/org/project)
- [Tutorial Series](https://learn.example.com)
```

**For sub-labels within content**:
```markdown
###### [GitHub: Repository](https://github.com/org/project): *Description of what you'll find*
```

### Advantages & Disadvantages
**Format**: Use + and - with proper escaping
```markdown
\+ This is an advantage or positive aspect
\+ Another benefit or strength
\- This is a disadvantage or limitation
\- Another concern or weakness
```
**Why escaping**: The backslash prevents markdown from interpreting + and - as list markers

### CLI Commands
**Format**: Backticks for command, italics for description
```markdown
- `npm install package`: *Installs the specified package*
- `git commit -m "message"`: *Creates a commit with a message*
- `docker build -t name .`: *Builds a Docker image with specified tag*
```

### Code Blocks
**Format**: Standard markdown fenced code blocks with language specification
- Use Fira Code font (automatically applied by CSS)
- Always specify language for syntax highlighting
- Single blank line before and after code blocks

```markdown
```python
def example_function():
    """This is a docstring"""
    return "formatted code"
```
```

**Supported languages**: javascript, python, css, html, bash, typescript, go, rust, java, sql, json, yaml, etc.

### Inline Code
**Format**: Backticks for inline code mentions
```markdown
Use the `useState` hook to manage component state.
```
- Rendered in Fira Code at 12px
- Slight background color for visibility

### Callout Boxes
**Available types**: idea, todo, warning

**Format**:
```markdown
<div class="idea">
<div class="idea-title">Idea</div>
Your idea content goes here. Can include multiple paragraphs, code, lists, etc.
</div>

<div class="todo">
<div class="todo-title">Todo</div>
Your todo content goes here with circular checkmark icon.
</div>

<div class="warning">
<div class="warning-title">Warning</div>
Your warning content goes here with exclamation icon.
</div>
```

**When to use**:
- **Idea**: For insights, suggestions, or creative thoughts
- **Todo**: For action items, tasks, or reminders
- **Warning**: For important cautions, security notes, or critical information

### Blockquotes
**Primary Use**: Table of contents at document start
```markdown
>[toc]
```

**Secondary Use**: General quotes or tips
```markdown
> **Pro tip**: Always validate user input on both client and server side to prevent injection attacks.
```
- Dotted border, 5px border radius
- Light-gray background
- Italic text
- Slightly transparent (0.85 opacity)

### Images
**Format**: HTML image syntax with optional caption that provides css for padding, width, and alignment
When editing existing notes or adding images, images that are formatted as below:
```markdown
![jl.png](:/76cd4725a4e0415c9c36e5fc90c3c19d)
```

 ... should be converted to html:
```markdown
<figure class="img-center">
    <img src="/path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description">
	<figcaption>Figure 1. This is a comment for an example of how an image should be formatted.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Tables
**Format**: Standard markdown tables, compact spacing
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| More 1   | More 2   | More 3   |
```
**Best Practices**:
- Use tables for structured data comparison
- Keep column widths reasonable
- Use header row for column labels

### Lists
**Unordered Lists**:
```markdown
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item (2 spaces indent)
  - Another nested item
- Third item
```

**Ordered Lists**:
```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

**Task Lists**:
```markdown
- [ ] Unchecked item
- [x] Checked item (renders italic with reduced opacity)
- [ ] Another unchecked item
```


## Quality Checklist
Before finalizing any Joplin markdown artifact, verify:

- [ ] `>[toc]` tag present at document start (for h2-headed documents)
- [ ] Two blank lines before h2 headings
- [ ] One blank line before h3, h4, h5, h6 headings
- [ ] "---" separator ONLY under h3 headings (NEVER after h1 or h2)
- [ ] Single blank line between content elements
- [ ] No excessive vertical spacing
- [ ] Links formatted as `- [Text](URL)` or `###### [Source: Title](URL): *description*`
- [ ] Advantages/disadvantages with `\+` and `\-` (escaped)
- [ ] CLI commands as `` `command`: *description* ``
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy (h2 → h3 → h4 → h5 → h6)
- [ ] Information density maximized
- [ ] Content starts immediately after headings (except for h3 with separator)
- [ ] Code blocks have language specification
- [ ] Callout boxes use proper HTML structure


## CSS-Aware Formatting
Understanding why certain formatting choices are made:

### Why NO horizontal rules after h1/h2?
- h1 and h2 headings already have `border-bottom` styling in CSS
- Adding "---" would create visual redundancy
- The CSS border provides consistent, professional styling

### Why h3 gets horizontal rules?
- h3 doesn't have border-bottom in CSS
- The "---" creates visual separation for major sections
- Maintains consistent visual hierarchy

### Typography Stack
- **Headings (h1-h5)**: Bitter (serif) - Creates visual hierarchy, professional appearance
- **Body text**: Inter (sans-serif) at 14px - Excellent readability for extended reading
- **Code**: Fira Code (monospace) at 12px - Programming ligatures, clear distinction
- **h6**: Sans-serif at 0.9rem - Differentiates from main heading levels

### Color Palette
- **Body text**: Dark gray (#4d4d4d) - High contrast without harsh black
- **Links**: Bright blue (#3486f3) - Clear affordance
- **Code background**: Light gray (#f5f5f5) - Subtle differentiation
- **Callouts**: Color-coded by type (yellow for idea, teal for todo, red for warning)


## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
1. **Horizontal rules after h1/h2**: These headings already have CSS borders
2. **Excessive Spacing**: Multiple blank lines between sections
3. **Wrong Separator Usage**: Using "---" under h2, h4, h5, or h6 headings
4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Mixing different link styles or bullet formats
5. **Poor Hierarchy**: Jumping from h2 to h5 without intermediate levels
6. **Verbose Descriptions**: Long-winded explanations when concise summaries suffice
7. **Missing Context**: Technical rundowns without advantages/disadvantages or key resources
8. **Unescaped Characters**: Using + and - without backslash escaping in advantage/disadvantage lists
9. **Missing Language Tags**: Code blocks without language specification
10. **Forgetting Table of Contents**: Omitting `>[toc]` from multi-section documents


## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Technical Rundown Request
**User**: "Give me a technical rundown of FastAPI"
**Action**:
1. Activate markdown-formatting skill
2. Create comprehensive technical rundown with `>[toc]`
3. Structure with h2 main title, h3 sections with "---" separators
4. Include Overview, Common Commands, Implementation sections
5. Add advantages/disadvantages with proper escaping

### Example 2: Research Summary for Joplin
**User**: "Summarize this article about neural networks for my Joplin notes"
**Action**:
1. Create article summary with proper metadata
2. Use h3 sections with "---" for Summary and Key Takeaways
3. Include inline code for technical terms
4. Add callout boxes for important warnings or insights

### Example 3: Book Notes
**User**: "Create chapter summaries for 'Clean Code' in Joplin format"
**Action**:
1. Generate book summary with author context
2. Use h3 sections with "---" for each chapter
3. 2-5 sentence summaries per chapter
4. Maintain compact spacing throughout

### Example 4: Technical Survey
**User**: "Give me a technical survey of Python web frameworks"
**Action**:
1. Create comparison with `>[toc]`
2. Optional comparison table at top
3. Each framework gets h3 section with "---"
4. Include advantages/disadvantages for each
5. Add key resources with proper link formatting


## Integration Notes
- **Automatic Activation**: This skill automatically activates when "Joplin" is mentioned or technical documentation is requested
- **User Preferences**: Deeply integrated with user's documented preferences in CLAUDE.md
- **CSS Compatibility**: All formatting choices align with user's custom Joplin CSS (userstyle.css and userchrome.css)
- **Workflow Integration**: Compatible with user's ~/Projects directory structure and research practices
- **Typography Awareness**: Formatting takes advantage of Bitter, Inter, and Fira Code font stack
