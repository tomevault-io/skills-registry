# Building with fullstackrecipes

Discover and follow recipes via MCP resources for setup guides, skills, and cookbooks. The meta-skill for using fullstackrecipes effectively.

## How fullstackrecipes Works

fullstackrecipes provides setup instructions for building full-stack applications and skills to work with them. Content is organized into two types:

1. **Setup Recipes**: Step-by-step guides to configure tools and services (e.g., setting up authentication, database, payments)
2. **Skills**: Instructions for working with previously configured tools (e.g., writing queries, using auth, logging)

**Cookbooks** bundle related recipes together in sequence. For example, "Base App Setup" includes Next.js, Shadcn UI, Neon Postgres, Drizzle ORM, and AI SDK setup recipes and skills.

## Accessing Recipes via MCP

The fullstackrecipes MCP server exposes all recipes and cookbooks as resources. Resources are organized by type:

- `recipe://` - Individual setup guides and skills
- `cookbook://` - Bundled recipe sequences

### Set up MCP Server

If the MCP server is not already set up, add it with:

```bash
bunx add-mcp https://fullstackrecipes.com/api/mcp -y
```

### Read a Specific Recipe

Fetch the full content of any recipe by its resource URI:

```
Read the "neon-drizzle-setup" resource from fullstackrecipes
```

The recipe content includes all steps, code examples, and file paths needed to complete the setup.

## Best Practices for Following Recipes

### Follow Recipes Exactly

Recipes are tested instructions. Follow them step-by-step without modifications unless you have a specific reason to deviate.

### Complete Dependencies First

Some recipes depend on others. The MCP resource descriptions indicate prerequisites. Complete setup recipes before using their corresponding skills.

### Use Skills for Day-to-Day Work

Once a tool is configured, use the skill for ongoing development. Skills contain patterns, code examples, and API references that apply to the configured tools.

### Check for Updates

Recipes are updated as libraries evolve. When troubleshooting issues or starting new features, fetch the latest recipe content from the MCP server rather than relying on cached instructions.

## Authoring Recipes

When writing recipes that include installable utilities, use the `{% registry %}` tag to provide both CLI installation and source code viewing.

### Registry Tag

The registry tag renders:

1. **Install via shadcn CLI** - A copy-able command to install the utility
2. **Source code viewer** - Collapsible code block showing the full source

Example usage:

```markdoc
{% registry items="assert" /%}
```

This renders the CLI command and source code from `public/r/assert.json`. Users can install via CLI or copy the code directly.

### Avoid Code Duplication

When using a registry tag, **do not duplicate the code** in the recipe. The registry tag handles displaying the source code automatically.

Bad:

```markdoc
{% registry items="workflow-stream" /%}

Install via the registry above, or create manually:

\`\`\`typescript
// src/workflows/steps/stream.ts
// ... same code as registry item ...
\`\`\`
```

Good:

```markdoc
{% registry items="workflow-stream" /%}

Import and use the stream utilities in your workflow:

\`\`\`typescript
import { startStream, finishStream } from "@/workflows/steps/stream";
\`\`\`
```

The registry tag already provides the installation command and source code. Only add usage examples or explanations that aren't part of the installable code itself.
