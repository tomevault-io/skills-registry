# Refactoring Catalog (Multi-Language)

A comprehensive, technique-by-technique catalog of refactoring best practices for any language, sourced from Martin Fowler's *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code* (2nd Edition) and Alexander Shvets' *Refactoring in Java* (Refactoring Guru). Adapted for Python, TypeScript, Go, and Rust with idiomatic examples.

## Step 0: Detect Language

Before applying any technique, detect the project's stack:

| Project File | Language | Idiom Style |
|---|---|---|
| `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` | Java | OOP, Stream API |
| `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` / `setup.py` | Python | Duck typing, comprehensions |
| `package.json` + `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript | Functional-OOP hybrid |
| `package.json` (no tsconfig) | JavaScript | Prototype-based, functional |
| `*.csproj` | C# | OOP, LINQ |
| `go.mod` | Go | Composition, implicit interfaces |
| `build.gradle.kts` | Kotlin | OOP + functional |
| `Gemfile` | Ruby | Duck typing, open classes |
| `composer.json` | PHP | OOP |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust | Ownership, traits, no inheritance |
| `Package.swift` | Swift | Protocol-oriented |

If the language is **Java**, apply techniques with Java OOP, Stream API where appropriate, and the project's detected Java version constraints.

## Language Support Matrix

| Concept | Python | TypeScript | Go | Rust |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Class / struct | `class` | `class` | `struct` + methods | `struct` + `impl` |
| Inheritance | `class Child(Parent)` | `extends` | Embedding (no inheritance) | Traits (no inheritance) |
| Interface / contract | `Protocol` / `ABC` | `interface` | `interface` (implicit) | `trait` |
| Encapsulation | `_private` convention | `private` keyword | Unexported (lowercase) | Private by default, `pub` |
| Polymorphism | Duck typing + ABC | Interfaces + classes | Implicit interfaces | Trait objects + generics |
| Generics | `typing.Generic[T]` | `<T>` | `[T any]` | `<T: Trait>` |
| Error handling | Exceptions | Exceptions | Error values (`error`) | `Result<T, E>` |
| Null safety | `None` / `Optional[T]` | `null` / `undefined` / `?` | `nil` (zero values) | `Option<T>` |
| Collections pipeline | Comprehensions / generators | Array methods (`.map`, `.filter`) | `for range` (no pipeline) | Iterator chain (`.filter().map()`) |
| Pattern matching | `match` (3.10+) | `switch` (no pattern matching) | `switch` (no pattern matching) | `match` (exhaustive) |
| Factory pattern | `@classmethod` / module function | Static method / function | `NewXxx()` function | `Type::new()` associated fn |
| Builder pattern | `__init__` + kwargs / dataclass | Fluent builder class | Functional options | Builder with consuming `self` |

## Core Philosophy

**Refactoring is the process of changing the internal structure of code without altering its observable behavior.** It is a disciplined technique, not a random cleanup. The golden rule is: Cover → Modify → Refactor (always have tests before you start).

## How to Use This Skill

1. **Detect** the language (Step 0 above)
2. **Diagnose first**: Identify the code smell (see `techniques/00-code-smells-diagnostic.md`)
3. **Check applicability**: See `references/language-applicability.md` for technique availability per language
4. **Select technique**: Each smell maps to one or more refactoring techniques
5. **Read the technique file**: Each technique has multi-language examples (Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust)
6. **For Java**: Use Java OOP/Stream idioms and honor Java 8 versus Java 11+ API availability
7. **For language idiom mapping**: See `references/language-idioms.md`
8. **Apply incrementally**: Small steps, test after each change, commit frequently

## Technique Categories

The techniques are organized in 7 groups. Each technique has its own file in the `techniques/` directory.

### Group 1: Composing Methods (techniques/01-XX)
Techniques for building clean, well-structured methods. The foundation of all refactoring.

## Diagnostic Guide

Start with `techniques/00-code-smells-diagnostic.md` to identify which techniques apply to your code. The diagnostic maps 24 code smells to their recommended refactoring techniques.

## Applying the Skill

When given code to refactor:

1. Detect the language (Step 0)
2. Read `techniques/00-code-smells-diagnostic.md` to identify the smells present
3. For each identified smell, read the corresponding technique file(s)
4. Check `references/language-applicability.md` — if the technique doesn't apply to the target language, the table shows the alternative
5. Apply techniques in small steps, always testing between changes
6. Provide idiomatic examples for the detected language
7. Explain WHY each refactoring improves the code, not just HOW to do it
8. For language-specific idiom translations, consult `references/language-idioms.md`

## Key Principles

These principles underpin every technique in the catalog:

1. **Names matter more than length** — a well-named 1-line function is better than an inline expression
2. **Small steps** — extract small fragments, test, commit. Never batch multiple changes
3. **Intention over implementation** — code should communicate WHAT, not HOW
4. **Data and logic that change together should live together** — cohesion is king
5. **Prefer composition over inheritance** — delegation is more flexible than extends
6. **Immutability is a powerful preservative** — immutable data is easier to reason about
7. **CQS (Command-Query Separation)** — a function either returns a value or modifies state, never both
