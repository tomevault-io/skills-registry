# Configuration

## Name configuration

Configuration should, as a rule, nest objects rather than use underscores. For example, given the configuration that sets where "state" is stored, it should be something like:

```yaml
state:
  redis:
    address: "..."
    password: "..."
    database: "..."
```

Try and avoid underscores (e.g. use "redis.address" and not "redis_address")

## Consume Configuration
Configuration parameters should be accessible via:
1.  **Command Line Flag**: Use dot notation to match file structure (e.g., `--slack.api.key="abcde"`).
2.  **Environment Variable**: With a prefix (e.g., `ANNOUNCE_SLACK_API_KEY="abcde"`).
3.  **File**: See below.

Use [spf13/viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for implementation.

## Store Configuration Files
Store configuration in a path that follows the **XDG standards**.
Use [ardg/xdg](https://github.com/ardg/xdg) for finding or writing to those files.
