# Documentation Best Practices

This skill provides guidance for creating consistent, professional documentation for the MTG Agent project implementation.

## Purpose

Maintain high-quality, actionable documentation that follows senior developer standards with:
- Clear task breakdowns with time estimates
- Comprehensive verification steps
- Rollback procedures for safety
- Testing integrated throughout
- Professional commit messages

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating new phase documentation
- Writing task breakdowns for implementation
- Documenting verification procedures
- Setting up testing requirements
- Creating progress tracking documents
- Writing commit messages
- Updating implementation plans

## Documentation Structure Standards

### Phase README Format

Each phase README should include:

1. **Phase Overview**
   - Phase number and name
   - Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
   - Duration estimate
   - Prerequisites

2. **Objectives**
   - Clear, measurable goals
   - 3-5 bullet points max
   - Specific deliverables

3. **Why This Phase**
   - Business/technical justification
   - Dependencies explained
   - Risk mitigation

4. **Sub-Phases**
   - List of sub-phases with brief descriptions
   - Estimated time for each
   - Dependencies between sub-phases

5. **Success Criteria**
   - Checklist of completion requirements
   - Verification that phase is truly done
   - Performance targets if applicable

6. **Next Phase**
   - Link to next phase
   - What will be built upon

### Task Documentation Format

Each task should include:

1. **Task Header**
   ```markdown
   ### Task X.Y: [Clear Task Name]
   **Estimated Time:** X minutes/hours
   **Prerequisites:** [What must be done first]
   ```

2. **Objectives**
   - What this task accomplishes
   - Why it's necessary

3. **Steps**
   - Numbered, specific steps
   - Include commands to run
   - Code examples where applicable
   - File paths clearly stated

4. **Verification**
   ```markdown
   **Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Commands to verify task completion
   command1
   command2
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   - What success looks like
   ```

5. **Success Criteria**
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Specific criterion 1
   - [ ] Specific criterion 2
   - [ ] Specific criterion 3
   ```

6. **Common Issues**
   - Known problems and solutions
   - Troubleshooting steps

### Code Examples

To include code examples:

**For Configuration Files:**
````markdown
**Create:** `path/to/file.ext`

```language
// Full file content here
// With comments explaining key parts
```
````

**For Commands:**
````markdown
```bash
# Comment explaining what this does
command --flag value
```
````

**For Multi-Step Procedures:**
````markdown
```bash
# Step 1: Setup
command1

# Step 2: Execute
command2

# Step 3: Verify
command3
```
````

### Verification Steps Format

Every task must include verification:

```markdown
**Verification:**
```bash
# Test command 1
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Test command 2
npm test

# Test command 3
docker-compose ps
```

**Expected Output:**
- Service returns 200 OK
- All tests pass
- All containers running

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Command 1 passes
- [ ] Command 2 passes
- [ ] Command 3 passes
```

### Rollback Procedures

Include rollback steps for safety:

```markdown
## Rollback Procedure

If this task causes issues:

```bash
# Step 1: Stop services
docker-compose down

# Step 2: Restore from backup
git checkout <previous-commit>

# Step 3: Restart
docker-compose up -d
```

**When to Rollback:**
- Verification fails repeatedly
- Breaks existing functionality
- Introduces security vulnerability
```

## Commit Message Standards

Follow conventional commits:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add session-based authentication middleware

Implement session-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing.
Includes middleware for protected routes and session validation.

- Add bcrypt password hashing
- Create session middleware with Redis store
- Implement auth middleware
- Add tests for auth flow

Closes #123
```

```
fix(rate-limit): correct Redis connection leak

Fixed issue where Redis connections weren't properly closed,
causing connection pool exhaustion under load.

- Close Redis connections in finally block
- Add connection pool monitoring
- Update tests to verify cleanup
```

```
docs(phase1): add database setup documentation

Created comprehensive documentation for Phase 1.1 database setup
including schema, migrations, and verification steps.
```

## Progress Tracking

### Task Status

Use clear status indicators:
- ⏸️ Not Started
- 🔄 In Progress
- ✅ Completed
- ❌ Blocked
- ⚠️ Needs Review

### Update Frequency

Update documentation:
- ✅ Before starting a task (mark in progress)
- ✅ Immediately after completing task (mark complete)
- ✅ When blocked (document blocker)
- ✅ When requirements change

### Completion Checklist

Mark tasks complete only when:
- [ ] All code written and committed
- [ ] All verification steps pass
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed (if applicable)
- [ ] No known issues

## Testing Integration

### Test Documentation Standard

For each phase/task, document:

```markdown
## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test X functionality
- [ ] Test Y edge case
- [ ] Test Z error handling

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test A to B integration
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test performance

### Manual Verification
```bash
# Command to verify manually
test-command
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Specific outcome 1
- Specific outcome 2
```

### Test-First Approach

When possible:
1. Write verification steps BEFORE implementation
2. Run verification (should fail initially)
3. Implement feature
4. Run verification (should pass)
5. Document results

## Documentation Maintenance

### Keep Documentation Current

- Update docs in same commit as code changes
- Document decisions and rationale
- Note workarounds and TODOs
- Link related documents

### Review and Refactor

Periodically review documentation for:
- Outdated information
- Broken links
- Unclear instructions
- Missing verification steps

## Templates Usage

To use the bundled templates:

1. **Task Documentation:** See `references/task-template.md`
2. **Verification Steps:** See `references/verification-template.md`
3. **Phase README:** See `assets/phase-readme-template.md`

Load these references as needed when creating new documentation.

## Best Practices Summary

✅ **DO:**
- Write clear, specific steps
- Include time estimates
- Provide verification commands
- Document expected outputs
- Include rollback procedures
- Write tests alongside code
- Update docs with code changes
- Use consistent formatting

❌ **DON'T:**
- Leave verification steps vague
- Skip rollback procedures
- Document without testing
- Mix multiple concerns in one task
- Forget to update status
- Omit time estimates
- Skip commit message body

## Examples

See bundled references for complete examples of:
- Task documentation with full verification
- Phase README with comprehensive breakdown
- Verification step templates
