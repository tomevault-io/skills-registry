# TanStack Suite Skill

Use this skill when you’re building or maintaining apps with the **TanStack ecosystem**, especially when you need:

- Correct **package selection** (core vs adapter vs devtools)
- **Version alignment** across related packages
- Correct **SSR/data-loading** and **hydration** behavior
- **Performance** best practices (tables, lists, routers)
- **Devtools** setup and debugging workflows

This skill covers:

- **TanStack Start** (full-stack React meta-framework)
- **TanStack Router** (type-safe routing)
- **TanStack Query** (async server-state)
- **TanStack Table** (headless tables/datagrids)
- **TanStack DB** (reactive client DB + sync)
- **TanStack Store** (signals-like reactive store)
- **TanStack Virtual** (virtualized lists/grids)
- **TanStack Pacer** (debounce/throttle/rate-limit/queue/batch utilities)
- **TanStack Form** (type-safe form state + validation)
- **TanStack AI** (type-safe AI SDK + tool calling + streaming)
- **TanStack Devtools** (unified devtools panel + plugins)

## How to use this skill

### 1) Identify the project archetype

Pick the closest archetype before writing code:

1. **TanStack Start app** (recommended when you control the full stack)
2. **React + Vite app** (add Router/Query/etc manually)
3. **Monorepo** (workspace version alignment is critical)

### 2) Run the audit scripts early

From the project root, run:

```bash
node path/to/skill/scripts/tanstack-audit.mjs
node path/to/skill/scripts/tanstack-usage-report.mjs
node path/to/skill/scripts/tanstack-router-plugin-check.mjs
node path/to/skill/scripts/tanstack-devtools-snippet.mjs
```

These scripts are **read-only** and help you quickly detect:

- Which TanStack packages are installed
- Common version-mismatch footguns
- Whether Router file-based generation is configured
- A ready-to-paste Devtools setup snippet based on installed plugins

### 3) Load the smallest relevant reference doc

This skill includes package-specific reference docs under `references/`. Load only what you need:

- `references/tanstack-start.md`
- `references/tanstack-router.md`
- `references/tanstack-query.md`
- `references/tanstack-table.md`
- `references/tanstack-db.md`
- `references/tanstack-store.md`
- `references/tanstack-virtual.md`
- `references/tanstack-pacer.md`
- `references/tanstack-form.md`
- `references/tanstack-ai.md`
- `references/tanstack-devtools.md`
- `references/versioning-and-packages.md`

## Operating principles

### Prefer official adapters + idiomatic patterns

- Prefer **framework adapters** (e.g. `@tanstack/react-query`, `@tanstack/react-router`, `@tanstack/react-table`) over lower-level core packages unless you’re authoring an adapter.
- Use **file-based routing** and **generated route trees** where supported; avoid hand-maintaining giant route configs.

### Keep versions aligned

Some TanStack package families are designed to move together.

- **Router + Start**: in many setups, `@tanstack/react-router`, `@tanstack/router-plugin`, `@tanstack/react-router-devtools`, and `@tanstack/react-start` should be kept on the **same version line**.
- **Query + devtools**: keep major versions aligned (e.g. Query v5 with `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`).

Use `scripts/tanstack-audit.mjs` to detect mismatches.

### SSR and data correctness first

- If using **TanStack Start**, treat **server-only code** as server-only (keys, secrets, DB credentials).
- For **Query**, ensure **prefetch + dehydrate/hydrate** is correct, and avoid double-fetching.
- For **Router**, prefer **loader/action** patterns for route-coupled data.

### Performance defaults

- Tables and virtual lists can become performance traps.
- Enforce stable references (memoize columns/data), use virtualization where appropriate, and avoid unnecessary rerenders.

### Devtools are part of the feature set

- Prefer the **TanStack Devtools unified panel** when possible.
- Otherwise use dedicated devtools (e.g. Query devtools component) and ensure dev-only loading.

## Common integration recipes

### Start + Router + Query baseline

- Use Router’s **route loaders** for route-coupled data needs.
- Use Query for cached async state and background refetching.
- In Start, consider preloading/prefetching queries in loaders and then dehydrating for the client.

### Store + Router context

- Use `@tanstack/react-store` for **small, app-wide reactive state** (auth state, UI preferences, feature flags).
- Prefer Router **route context** for values that are truly navigation-scoped.

### DB + Query

- Use DB for **local-first** reads/writes and live queries.
- Sync to server via the collection’s mutation hooks/handlers.
- Consider DB-backed collections that plug into Query for cache coherence.

### Table + Query + Virtual

- Use Query to fetch server-side paginated/sorted data.
- Use Table for column/sorting/filtering state.
- Use Virtual for rendering only visible rows (especially > 200 rows).

### Pacer + Query for debounced/throttled fetching

- Use Pacer when you need stable, testable debouncing/throttling primitives.
- Typical examples: typeahead search, scroll/resize handlers, rate-limited mutation bursts.

### Form + Query

- Use Form for local form state.
- Use Query mutations for server writes (or Start server functions).
- Keep server validation canonical; client validation is UX.

### Form + Start/Router

- Prefer Start **server functions** or Router **actions**.
- Keep secrets on the server.
- Return structured errors that map cleanly to field errors.

### AI + Start

- Keep provider keys on the server.
- Stream responses (SSE) to clients.
- Use tool definitions with schema validation.

### Devtools (unified)

- Use `@tanstack/react-devtools` + plugin packages when available.
- Keep devtools dev-only unless you explicitly need production debugging.

## What “done” looks like

When implementing TanStack features, consider the work complete only when:

- ✅ Dependencies are correct and versions are aligned
- ✅ TypeScript types are clean (no `any` escapes unless justified)
- ✅ SSR/hydration path is correct (no double fetch, no hydration warnings)
- ✅ Devtools integration exists (dev-only) for the relevant libs
- ✅ Performance hazards are addressed (virtualization where needed)
- ✅ There is a small, realistic example route/component proving the feature

## Troubleshooting checklist

When something is broken, check in this order:

1. **Versions**: run `scripts/tanstack-audit.mjs` and fix mismatches.
2. **Devtools**: if available, use them to inspect Router/Query/Form/Pacer/AI state.
3. **SSR/hydration**: confirm server and client render match; verify Query hydration and Router loaders.
4. **Duped packages**: ensure there is only one installed copy of key packages (common in monorepos).
5. **Bundler config**: ensure Router plugin/devtools integrations are in the correct place (e.g. Vite plugins order).

## What this skill does not do

- It does **not** replace TanStack documentation.
- It does **not** assume your exact framework unless you tell it (Start vs plain React).
- It does **not** run network operations by default.
