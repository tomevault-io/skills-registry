# /word-smithy

The editorial workshop. One entry point for all writing workflows.

## When Invoked

### Step 1: Load Baseline Context

Read the shared config and project config (if present) to discover all available resources.

**Shared config location:** `~/.claude/shared/word-smithy/config.md`
**Project config location:** `.word-smithy/config.md` in the current project root

From each config, load:
- **Voice docs** (always loaded, governs all writing)
- **Principles docs** (always loaded, governs all writing)

Do NOT load references or protocol bodies yet. Those are loaded on demand.

### Step 1b: Discover Existing Writing Context

Scan for writing-related context that exists outside word-smithy's own configs:

- `CLAUDE.md` in the project root (look for voice, style, tone, or writing sections)
- `.claude/rules/` files that mention writing, voice, editorial, or style
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global rules)
- `.cursorrules` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (for Cursor/Copilot users)

If any are found, acknowledge them:

> I found existing writing context in:
> - [list files found]
>
> I'll use these alongside word-smithy's configs. If anything conflicts, your project-level rules win.

This ensures word-smithy layers on top of what the user already has rather than replacing it. Users do not need to migrate existing rules into word-smithy's format for them to be respected.

### Step 1c: First-Run Check

After loading configs and discovering context, check whether anything meaningful was found. Specifically:

1. Do the `voice` paths in the config(s) point to files that actually exist?
2. Was any writing context discovered in Step 1b (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.)?

**If no voice file exists AND no external writing context was found**, the user has nothing loaded. Enter onboarding mode instead of proceeding to Step 2.

**If a voice file exists** (or meaningful writing context was found in Step 1b), skip onboarding and proceed to Step 2.

### Step 1d: Onboarding (first-run only)

When onboarding is triggered, walk the user through creating a minimal voice profile. Don't send them to the guide. Do it here, interactively.

Say:

> word-smithy is installed, but you don't have a voice profile yet. That's the thing that keeps your AI from sounding like a robot.
>
> Want to set one up now? Takes about five minutes.

If the user says no, proceed to Step 2 with no voice loaded (the skill still works, just without voice guardrails).

If the user says yes, walk through these four steps:

**1. Collect samples**

> Paste 2-3 short pieces of writing you're proud of. Emails, blog posts, social posts, anything. I need to hear what you sound like.

Read what they provide. Identify patterns: sentence length habits, vocabulary preferences, structural tendencies, tone.

**2. Confirm the patterns**

Present what you found:

> Here's what I'm noticing in your writing:
> - [structural pattern, e.g., "You lead with the problem, not the solution"]
> - [sentence pattern, e.g., "Short sentences mixed with longer ones, lots of contractions"]
> - [vocabulary pattern, e.g., "Plain words, no jargon"]
>
> Does that sound right? Anything I'm missing?

Let them correct or add. This is collaborative, not prescriptive.

**3. Hard bans**

> What words or phrases do you never want to see in your writing? Things that make you cringe when AI produces them.
>
> Common ones people ban: "leverage," "utilize," "Furthermore," "It's worth noting," "It's not X. It's Y."

Collect their list.

**4. Save the profile**

Write the voice profile to `~/.claude/shared/voice-core.md` (or whatever path their config specifies). Use the structure from the [Creating a Voice Profile](guides/creating-a-voice-profile.md) guide. Confirm:

> Saved your voice profile to `~/.claude/shared/voice-core.md`. It's loaded now and will be loaded every time you invoke `/word-smithy`.
>
> This is a living document. Next time something sounds off, tell me and I'll update it.

Then proceed to Step 2.

**After onboarding, offer next steps (don't block on them):**

> Your voice profile is set. Two optional things when you have time:
> - **Condense a writing book** you love into an AI reference (see `guides/condensing-a-book.md`)
> - **Write a protocol** for a workflow you repeat (see `guides/writing-a-protocol.md`)
>
> For now, let's write something.

### Step 2: Ask the Question

Ask the user:

> What are you working on?

Wait for a plain-text answer. No menu, no numbered options.

### Step 3: Match Intent to Protocol

Scan all protocol paths from both configs (shared + project). For each `.md` file found:
1. Read the YAML frontmatter
2. Check for `name`, `triggers`, and `description` fields
3. If a file lacks these fields, skip it (it is not a word-smithy protocol)

Match the user's answer against the `triggers` field of all discovered protocols. Use semantic matching, not exact string matching. The `triggers` field contains representative phrases, not an exhaustive list.

**If a match is found:**
> Looks like **[protocol name]**. [description]
>
> Running it.

Then load the full protocol file and any files listed in its `loads` field. Walk through the protocol step by step.

**If no match is found:**
> I don't have a protocol for that yet. Two options:
>
> 1. **Create one** (I'll help you write a protocol doc for this workflow)
> 2. **Just write** (I'll work with voice and principles loaded, no formal process)

If the user chooses "just write," proceed with voice + principles as guardrails. This is still better than writing without `/word-smithy` because the baseline context is active.

If the user chooses "create one," guide them through writing a new protocol doc:
- Ask what the workflow involves
- Ask where it should live (shared or project)
- Draft the protocol with proper frontmatter
- Save it to the appropriate directory
- It is immediately available for future `/word-smithy` invocations

### Step 4: Execute Protocol

When running a matched protocol:
1. The full protocol document is the process. Follow it step by step.
2. Load files from the `loads` field only when a step references them, not all at once.
3. Voice + principles stay loaded throughout as guardrails.
4. If a protocol references another protocol (e.g., BPP calls the McPhee Loop), discover and load that protocol when the step calls for it.

### Step 5: "Just Write" Fallback

When no protocol matched and the user chose to freestyle:
1. Voice core + any project voice profile are active.
2. Principles (if any) are active.
3. Writing references are available on request but not pre-loaded.
4. Apply the voice tests from voice-core.md to any draft before presenting it.

## Cross-Layer Rules

- Shared protocols never reference project protocols.
- Project protocols can reference shared protocols and shared references.
- If a project protocol and shared protocol have overlapping triggers, the project protocol wins.
- Voice and principles from both layers are always loaded together.

## Protocol Doc Format

For creating new protocol docs, use this frontmatter template:

```yaml
---
name: [Human-Readable Name]
triggers: [comma-separated phrases that describe when to use this]
description: [One-line description shown when confirming the match]
layer: [shared or project]
loads:
  - [paths to reference files this protocol needs]
---
```

The body of the protocol is the workflow itself. Write it however makes sense for the process. The skill reads and follows it as instructions.
