# Guided Development

## Overview

Guided development is a workflow designed for iterative, human-in-the-loop software development. Unlike traditional planning approaches that create detailed upfront plans, this workflow establishes problem boundaries, captures explicit human decisions, and enables incremental implementation with continuous feedback.

**Use this skill when:**
- The problem is exploratory and not fully understood upfront
- Human input is needed for key technical decisions
- Development will proceed iteratively across multiple sessions
- The human wants to maintain control rather than delegate to autonomous execution

## Workflow Decision Tree

When the skill is invoked, determine which phase to enter:

```
Does docs/development/NNN-<name>/ exist with materials?
├─ NO  → Initial Setup Phase (create problem_statement, decisions, runbook, progress)
└─ YES → Implementation Session Phase (load context, plan, implement, update progress)
```

## Initial Setup Phase

When no materials exist, guide the human through creating foundational documents via structured Q&A.

### Process

1. **Determine folder location**
   - Check for existing development session folders: `docs/development/`
   - Determine next number: `NNN` (e.g., 001, 002, etc.)
   - Ask human for feature name
   - Create folder: `docs/development/NNN-<name>/`

2. **Create problem_statement.md**
   - Load the template from `references/template-problem_statement.md`
   - Ask questions to understand the problem:
     - "What problem are you trying to solve?"
     - "What is the scope of this work? What's explicitly out of scope?"
     - "What does success look like?"
     - "Are there any constraints or requirements?"
   - Fill in the template with responses
   - Save as `problem_statement.md`

3. **Create decisions.md**
   - Load the template from `references/template-decisions.md`
   - **CRITICAL RULE:** MUST ask about every unclear aspect. MUST NOT assume "sensible defaults" or "de facto standards"
   - Probe for decisions on:
     - Language/framework choices
     - Library/dependency choices
     - Architectural patterns
     - Data storage approaches
     - Testing strategies
     - Error handling approaches
     - Security considerations
   - For each unclear aspect:
     - Explain why a decision is needed
     - Present options if helpful (without bias)
     - Ask for the human's choice
     - Record the decision with rationale
   - Save as `decisions.md`

4. **Create runbook.md**
   - Load the template from `references/template-runbook.md`
   - Ask questions:
     - "How should this code be built/compiled?"
     - "How should this code be run/tested?"
     - "Are there any other validation steps?"
     - "At what points during implementation should I pause and ask for your feedback?"
   - Fill in build, test, run, and validation instructions
   - Create structured feedback points
   - Save as `runbook.md`

5. **Create empty progress.md**
   - Load the template from `references/template-progress.md`
   - Create empty file (will be populated after first implementation session)
   - Save as `progress.md`

6. **Complete setup**
   - Inform human that setup is complete
   - Ask if they want to start the first implementation session now or later
   - If now, proceed to Implementation Session Phase

### Reference Materials

For detailed guidance on the initial setup phase, read `references/initial-setup.md`.

## Implementation Session Phase

When materials already exist, start an implementation session to continue development work.

### Process

1. **Load context**
   - Read `problem_statement.md` to understand the problem scope
   - Read `decisions.md` to understand what choices have been made
   - Read `runbook.md` to understand validation and feedback points
   - Read `progress.md` to understand what's been done and what's outstanding
   - Check for existing `plan-N.md` files to understand previous approaches

2. **Determine session number**
   - List existing `plan-N.md` files
   - Next session number = max(N) + 1
   - If no plan files exist, this is session 1

3. **Enter plan mode**
   - Based on loaded context, create a plan for this session
   - Plan should include:
     - What will be accomplished
     - Specific steps to take
     - Dependencies between steps
     - Expected validation points from runbook
     - Outstanding questions or uncertainties
   - Present plan to human for approval

4. **Save approved plan**
   - After human approves the plan, save as `plan-N.md` where N is the session number
   - Proceed with implementation

5. **Implement according to plan**
   - Follow the approved plan
   - **Respect feedback points:** When reaching a feedback point in runbook.md, MUST pause and ask for human input
   - **Document new decisions:** If new unclear aspects arise, update decisions.md and ask for human input
   - **Update runbook if needed:** If build/test/validation steps change, update runbook.md
   - **Follow existing decisions:** Use the choices recorded in decisions.md
   - Perform validation steps from runbook.md
   - Ensure all tests pass

6. **Update progress.md**
   - Add a new session entry using this format:
   ```markdown
   ## Session N (YYYY-MM-DD)

   ### Accomplished
   - [What was implemented/completed]
   - [Tests that now pass]
   - [Issues that were resolved]

   ### Outstanding
   - [What still needs to be done]
   - [Known issues or blockers]

   ### Questions
   - [New unclear aspects that need decisions]
   - [Uncertainties or concerns]
   ```

7. **Session completion**
   - Verify all changes are recorded in progress.md
   - Verify any new decisions are in decisions.md
   - Verify runbook.md is current
   - Inform human that session is complete
   - Summarize what was accomplished and what's next

### Reference Materials

For detailed guidance on implementation sessions, read `references/implementation-session.md`.

## Key Principles

### Workflow Principles

1. **No Assumptions**: Never assume "sensible defaults" or "de facto standards". Always ask for explicit human decisions.

2. **Respect Feedback Points**: Feedback points in runbook.md are mandatory pause points. Never skip them.

3. **Living Documents**: decisions.md, runbook.md, and progress.md are living documents that evolve throughout the development session.

4. **Session-Scoped Plans**: Each implementation session gets its own plan file. Plans are ephemeral and session-specific, not long-term roadmaps.

5. **Problem-Focused**: problem_statement.md defines the problem and scope, not the solution. It provides boundaries, not prescriptions.

### Engineering Principles

1. **Test Driven Development (TDD)**: For every new feature or bugfix, you MUST:
   - Write a failing test that correctly validates the desired functionality
   - Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
   - Write ONLY enough code to make the failing test pass
   - Run the test to confirm success
   - Refactor if needed while keeping tests green

2. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: The best code is no code. Don't add features we don't need right now. When it doesn't conflict with YAGNI, architect for extensibility and flexibility.

3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Work hard to reduce code duplication, even if the refactoring takes extra effort.

4. **Minimal Changes**: Make the SMALLEST reasonable changes to achieve the desired outcome. Prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones.

5. **Fix Broken Things Immediately**: All test failures are your responsibility, even if they're not your fault. Fix broken things immediately when you find them.

6. **Never Skip Tests**: Never delete a test because it's failing. Never write tests that "test" mocked behavior. Test output must be pristine to pass.

## Example Usage

**Starting new work:**
```
Human: "I want to add OAuth authentication to the app"
Agent: [Invokes dev-guided skill]
Agent: [Creates docs/development/001-oauth-auth/ folder]
Agent: [Guides through creating problem_statement, decisions, runbook, progress]
Agent: "Setup complete. Ready to start first implementation session?"
```

**Continuing existing work:**
```
Human: "Continue working on OAuth" [in directory with existing materials]
Agent: [Invokes dev-guided skill]
Agent: [Loads problem_statement, decisions, runbook, progress]
Agent: [Enters plan mode]
Agent: "Based on progress, I plan to implement token storage. Here's my plan..."
Agent: [After approval, saves as plan-2.md and implements]
Agent: [Updates progress.md with session 2 summary]
```
