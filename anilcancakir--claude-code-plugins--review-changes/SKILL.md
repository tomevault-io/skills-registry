# Code Review Task

Review all uncommitted changes in this repository for issues.

## Steps

1. Run `git diff` to get all uncommitted changes
2. Run `git diff --cached` for staged changes
3. For each modified file, analyze for:
   - Security vulnerabilities (see references/security-checklist.md)
   - Bugs and logic errors
   - Code quality issues (see references/quality-checklist.md)
4. Check test coverage for changed code
5. Categorize findings as Critical/Warning/Suggestion
6. Provide specific file:line references
7. Suggest fixes with code examples

## Reference Documents

For detailed checklists, read:
- `references/security-checklist.md` - OWASP Top 10 and stack-specific security
- `references/quality-checklist.md` - Code quality and best practices

## Stack Detection

Detect project stack from config files:
- `composer.json` + `artisan` = Laravel
- `pubspec.yaml` = Flutter
- `nuxt.config.*` = Nuxt.js
- `package.json` with "vue" = Vue

Apply stack-specific checks based on detection.

## Output Requirements

Return a structured report with:
- Summary counts by severity
- Each issue with file:line, explanation, and fix
- Test coverage status
- Prioritized recommendations

Focus on actionable feedback. Skip style-only issues unless they affect readability significantly.
