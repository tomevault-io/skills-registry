# Web Design Mastery

Production-grade UI design principles from Refactoring UI by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger.

## Core Design Workflow

### 1. Start with a Feature, Not a Layout

- Design the actual piece of functionality first
- Don't start with navigation, sidebar, or shell
- Details come later—work in grayscale first
- Don't design too much—work in cycles

### 2. Establish Systems Before Designing

Define these systems up front to eliminate decision fatigue:

**Spacing Scale (px):**

| Token | Size | Use Case |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | 4 | Micro gaps |
| 2 | 8 | Tight, within components |
| 3 | 12 | Related elements |
| 4 | 16 | Section padding |
| 6 | 24 | Between sections |
| 8 | 32 | Major separation |
| 12 | 48 | Large gaps |
| 16 | 64 | Hero spacing |
| 24 | 96 | Maximum separation |

**Type Scale (px):**

| Size | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| 12 | Labels, meta, fine print |
| 14 | Body text, default |
| 16 | Emphasis, subheadings |
| 18 | Section headings |
| 20 | Card titles |
| 24 | Page section titles |
| 30 | Page headings |
| 36 | Hero subheading |
| 48 | Hero heading |
| 60-72 | Display text |

**Shadow Scale (5 levels):**

| Level | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | Buttons, subtle lift |
| 2 | Cards, inputs |
| 3 | Dropdowns, popovers |
| 4 | Sticky elements |
| 5 | Modals, dialogs |

### 3. Build Hierarchy, Not Decoration

- **Primary**: Dark color (headlines, key actions)
- **Secondary**: Grey (supporting text, dates)
- **Tertiary**: Light grey (metadata, copyright)

Key principles:

- Size isn't everything—use weight and color
- Emphasize by de-emphasizing competing elements
- Labels are a last resort—combine with values
- Semantics are secondary to hierarchy

### 4. Apply Depth Meaningfully

- Light comes from above
- Shadows convey elevation (closer = more attention)
- Use two-part shadows for premium look
- Consider overlapping elements for layers

### 5. Finish with Polish

- Supercharge defaults (bullets → icons, style quotes)
- Add accent borders for visual interest
- Design empty states as first impressions
- Use fewer borders—prefer shadows or spacing

## Color System

**Categories needed:**

1. **Greys** (8-10 shades): Text, backgrounds, panels, borders
2. **Primary** (5-10 shades): Actions, active states, links
3. **Accents** (per semantic): Success, warning, error states

**Process for defining shades:**

1. Pick base color (500) that works as button background
2. Pick edges (100 for tinted bg, 900 for text)
3. Fill gaps: 700, 300 → 800, 600, 400, 200

**Key rules:**

- Use HSL for intuitive adjustments
- Increase saturation at lightness extremes
- Rotate hue toward bright (60°, 180°, 300°) for lighter
- Greys can be warm (yellow/orange tint) or cool (blue tint)
- Accessibility: 4.5:1 contrast for normal text, 3:1 for large

---

## Anti-Patterns

**NEVER do:**

- Grey text on colored backgrounds (hand-pick colors instead)
- Fill the whole screen when content needs less
- Use grids religiously (fixed widths often better)
- Ambiguous spacing (more space between groups than within)
- Relative sizing that doesn't scale
- Scale icons beyond intended size
- Rely on color alone for meaning
