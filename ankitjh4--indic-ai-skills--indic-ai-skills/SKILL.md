# Indian Constitution + BNS Lawyer Skill

RAG-based legal assistant for Indian constitutional law and BNS 2023 criminal law.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Query Constitution
python3 scripts/query.py "What are fundamental rights?"

# Query BNS
python3 scripts/query.py "What is Section 103 BNS?"

# Get more results
python3 scripts/query.py "Emergency provisions" -k 10
```

## Workflow

1. **Query** — run `python3 scripts/query.py "<question>"` with a natural-language legal question
2. **Review citations** — responses include Article/Section numbers; verify against official sources
3. **Refine** — use `-k 10` (or higher) if the initial results miss the relevant provision
4. **Cross-reference** — query both Constitution and BNS terms when a question spans civil and criminal law

## What You Can Ask

### Constitutional Law
- "What are fundamental rights under Part III?"
- "How is the President elected?"

- "Hate speech laws in BNS"
- "Sedition under Section 150 BNS"
- "Domestic violence sections in BNS"
