# Pump.fun

Create and trade tokens on Pump.fun's bonding curve on Solana.

**No authentication or login needed.** All operations use the PumpPortal Local Transaction API which builds transactions server-side. We sign them locally with our wallet and submit to Solana RPC.

## Scripts

All scripts are at `/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/`

### Token Creation

```bash
# Create a new token (auto-generates placeholder image)
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-create.sh [name] [symbol] [description] [image_path] [dev_buy_sol]

# Auto-generate random token
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-create.sh

# Create with initial dev buy (buys tokens with SOL in the same transaction)
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-create.sh "MyToken" "MTK" "My awesome token" "" 0.005
```

### Trading

```bash
# Buy tokens with SOL
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-buy.sh <mint_address> <sol_amount> [slippage_pct]

# Sell tokens (amount in tokens or "100%" for all)
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-sell.sh <mint_address> <amount|100%> [slippage_pct]
```

### Market Data

```bash
# Get coin information from pump.fun
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-coin.sh <mint_address>

# Get market data (reserves, last trade, etc.)
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-trades.sh <mint_address>

# Get trending coins (sorted by market cap)
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-trending.sh [limit]

# Search for coins
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-search.sh "search term"

# Get King of the Hill (top token by market cap)
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-koth.sh

# Get wallet token balances
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-balances.sh <wallet_address>

# Get rich data from DEXScreener (price changes, volume, buy/sell counts)
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-dexscreener.sh <mint_address>

# Timeframes: 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-candles.sh <mint_address> [timeframe] [limit]
```

### Advanced Analysis with AUTO-TUNING

The analyze tool combines data from multiple sources with **25+ candlestick patterns** and **auto-tuning** that learns from your trades:

```bash
# MAIN ANALYSIS TOOL - Use before any buy decision!
# Returns: trend, momentum, buy/sell pressure, volume, signals, BUY/WATCH/AVOID
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-analyze.js <mint_address>

# Quick analysis (skip candlestick patterns for speed)
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-analyze.js <mint_address> --quick

# SCAN TRENDING - Find opportunities across top tokens
# Returns ranked opportunities sorted by confidence
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-analyze.js scan [limit]
```

### Auto-Tuning System (Learns from Your Trades!)

The analyzer automatically adjusts its scoring weights based on trade outcomes:

```bash
# STEP 1: Record when you enter a trade
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-analyze.js record <mint> BUY <entry_price>
# Returns: tradeId (e.g., "Trade #1 recorded")

# STEP 2: Record when trade closes
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-analyze.js outcome <tradeId> win|loss <exit_price>
# System automatically adjusts weights based on which patterns/signals led to wins/losses

# View pattern & signal performance statistics
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-analyze.js stats

# Reset tuning to defaults
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-analyze.js reset-tuning
```

**How Auto-Tuning Works:**
1. When you record a trade, it saves which patterns and signals were present
2. When you record the outcome, it updates win/loss rates for each pattern/signal
3. After 5+ trades with a pattern, the weight adjusts based on actual performance
4. High win rate patterns get higher weights, poor performers get lower weights
5. Confidence thresholds auto-adjust if overall win rate drops too low

### Snapshot Tracking (Historical Data)

Build your own time-series data for additional trend analysis:

```bash
# Take a snapshot of token state
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-snapshot.js take <mint_address>

# Get snapshot history
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-snapshot.js history <mint_address> [hours]

# Analyze from snapshots
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-snapshot.js analyze <mint_address>

# List tracked tokens
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-snapshot.js list

# Clean old snapshots
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-snapshot.js clean [hours]
```

### Combined State (Recommended for Heartbeats)

```bash
# Get full bot state in one call: balance + positions + token status
# Returns: sol_balance, mode (NORMAL/DEFENSIVE/EMERGENCY), positions, my_token
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-state.sh
```

### Trade Tracking (P/L Management)

```bash
# Record a trade
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-track.js record <buy|sell> <mint> <sol_amount>

# Check buy limit for a token
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-track.js check <mint>

# Get P/L status and positions
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-track.js status

# Reset trade history
/home/openclaw/.openclaw/skills/pumpfun/scripts/pumpfun-track.js reset
```

## How Trading Works

1. **Token Creation**: Uploads image+metadata to pump.fun IPFS, then PumpPortal builds the create transaction (optionally with an initial dev buy bundled in), we sign it locally and submit to Solana
2. **Trading**: PumpPortal builds buy/sell transactions, we sign locally and submit to Solana
3. **Market Data**: Direct queries to pump.fun and DEXScreener APIs (no auth needed)

## Fees

- PumpPortal charges 0.5% per trade (included in transaction)
- Solana network fees (~0.000005 SOL per transaction)
- Token creation costs ~0.02 SOL in network fees

## Bonding Curve

- Tokens start on a bonding curve - price increases as more tokens are bought
- When ~$69k market cap is reached, token migrates to Raydium
- Selling returns tokens to the curve, decreasing price
