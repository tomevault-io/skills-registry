## Types (Semantic Versioning)

| Type | Version Bump | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `feat` | MINOR | New feature for the user |
| `fix` | PATCH | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | PATCH | Code change (no feature/fix) |
| `perf` | PATCH | Performance improvement |
| `style` | - | Formatting, whitespace |
| `docs` | - | Documentation only |
| `test` | - | Adding/updating tests |
| `build` | - | Build system, dependencies |
| `ci` | - | CI configuration |
| `chore` | - | Maintenance tasks |

**Breaking Changes**: Append `!` after type → `feat!:` triggers MAJOR bump

## Emoji Reference

| Emoji | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| ✨ | New feature (feat) |
| 🐛 | Bug fix (fix) |
| ♻️ | Refactoring (refactor) |
| ⚡ | Performance (perf) |
| 📝 | Documentation (docs) |

## Examples

```bash
# Feature

# Bug fix
fix(api): 🐛 resolve null pointer in user service

# Refactoring

# Release

## Rules

1. Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
2. Keep subject under 72 characters
3. Scope is optional but recommended for clarity
4. Body explains "why" not "what"
5. Reference issues: `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456`
6. Always include Co-Authored-By for AI-assisted commits
