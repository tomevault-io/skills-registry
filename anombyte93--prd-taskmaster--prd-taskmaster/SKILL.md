# customise-workflow

AI-driven workflow customisation for the `prd-taskmaster` plugin.
Replaces manual JSON editing. Part of the plugin's companion-skills family.

**Script**: `skills/customise-workflow/script.py` (all commands output JSON)
**Plugin config root**: `.atlas-ai/` (per-project, lives alongside TaskMaster's
`.taskmaster/`)

## When to Use

Activate when the user says: "customise workflow", "customize workflow",
"adjust PRD settings", "tune the skill", "change my defaults", or
"personalise prd-taskmaster".

Skip: generating a new PRD (use `/prd:go`), executing tasks (use
HANDOFF modes), or running research expansion (use `/expand-tasks`).

## The One Rule

**The AI asks the questions and writes the config. The user never manually
edits JSON. The config file is the output, not the input.** If the user wants
tweaks beyond the curated questions, point them at `.atlas-ai/customizations/`
(see "Customizations directory" below) — do not hand them raw JSON.

## Flow

```
LOAD → ASK → VALIDATE → WRITE → VERIFY
```

### Phase 1: LOAD current config

Run the script to load existing preferences (or defaults if first run):

```bash
python3 skills/customise-workflow/script.py load-config
```

Returns JSON with current preferences across 6 categories: provider,
validation, execution, template, autonomous, gates. Writes to
`.atlas-ai/config/atlas.json` if missing, seeding defaults.

### Phase 2: ASK curated questions

Read `questions/curated-questions.md` and ask each one via `AskUserQuestion`.
The questions are curated so plain-English answers map cleanly to config keys.
Example:

```
Q1: Which AI provider do you prefer for task generation?
  Options: Gemini (free, token-efficient), Claude Code (free, Max only),
           OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Direct API, OpenRouter, Ollama (local)

Q2: How strict should PRD validation be?
  Options: Strict (block on NEEDS_WORK), Normal (warn but allow GOOD+),
           Lenient (accept ACCEPTABLE+)

Q3: Which execution mode should prd-taskmaster default to?
  Options: A (Plan Mode), B (Ralph loop), C (Atlas Fleet), ...

...
```

Do NOT ask all questions at once. Ask one curated question at a time and
adapt follow-ups based on answers. (Same pattern as
`superpowers:brainstorming`.)

### Phase 3: VALIDATE answers

Run the script with each user answer as it arrives. The script validates the
answer against allowed values and returns either `ok: true` or a hint about
what's wrong.

```bash
python3 skills/customise-workflow/script.py validate-answer \
  --key provider_main --value gemini-cli
```

If validation fails, re-ask the question with the hint. Never write an invalid
value.

### Phase 4: WRITE config

After all curated questions are answered, commit the config:

```bash
python3 skills/customise-workflow/script.py write-config --input /tmp/answers.json
```

This writes to `.atlas-ai/config/atlas.json` in the current project.
Idempotent — re-running customise-workflow reads and updates the existing
file. The script creates the `.atlas-ai/config/` directory if missing.

### Phase 5: VERIFY

Show the user their final config and confirm it matches their intent:

```bash
python3 skills/customise-workflow/script.py show-config
```

If the user says "that's not what I meant" for any key, re-enter Phase 2 for
just that key, re-validate, and re-write.

## Script Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `load-config` | Load current `.atlas-ai/config/atlas.json` (or defaults) |
| `list-questions` | Return the curated question set as JSON |
| `validate-answer --key K --value V` | Validate a single answer |
| `write-config --input <file>` | Write validated answers to `.atlas-ai/config/atlas.json` |
| `show-config` | Display current config |
| `reset-config` | Delete `.atlas-ai/config/atlas.json` (back to defaults) |

## Config Schema

`.atlas-ai/config/atlas.json` has 7 top-level keys:

```json
{
  "token_economy": "conservative|balanced|performance",
  "provider": {
    "main": "gemini-cli|claude-code|anthropic|openai|openrouter|ollama|...",
    "model_main": "gemini-3-pro-preview|sonnet|gpt-4o|...",
    "research": "gemini-cli|perplexity|...",
    "model_research": "sonar-pro|gemini-3-pro-preview|...",
    "fallback": "gemini-cli|claude-code|...",
    "model_fallback": "gemini-3-flash-preview|haiku|..."
  },
  "validation": {
    "strictness": "strict|normal|lenient",
    "ai_review_default": true,
    "min_passing_grade": "EXCELLENT|GOOD|ACCEPTABLE|NEEDS_WORK"
  },
  "execution": {
    "preferred_mode": "A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J",
    "auto_handoff": true,
    "external_tool": "cursor|codex-cli|gemini-cli|..."
  },
  "template": {
    "default": "comprehensive|minimal",
    "custom_template_path": null
  },
  "autonomous": {
    "allow_self_brainstorm": true,
    "ralph_loop_auto_approve": true
  },
  "gates": {
    "skip_phase_0_if_validated": false,
    "skip_user_approval_in_discovery": false,
    "require_research_expansion": true
  }
}
```

Phase files (`skills/setup`, `skills/discover`, `skills/generate`,
`skills/handoff`, `skills/execute-task`) read this config at runtime and apply
user preferences before falling back to documented defaults.

`token_economy` here is honored by the engine itself: `load_fleet_config` reads it
from this file when `.atlas-ai/fleet.json` does not set one (fleet.json wins if it
does), so the economy you pick via this skill actually drives model-tier routing.

## Customizations directory

For tweaks that go beyond the curated questions — custom template overrides,
provider-model mapping tables, gate hooks, per-phase overrides — users can
drop files into `.atlas-ai/customizations/`. This is the escape hatch for
power users. The curated questions cover the 80% case; the customization
directory covers everything else.

Expected layout:

```
.atlas-ai/
  config/
    atlas.json              # written by this skill
  customizations/           # user-editable, never overwritten by this skill
    templates/              # custom PRD templates
    prompts/                # provider prompt overrides
    gates/                  # custom gate predicates
    README.md               # user-authored notes
```

Rules:

1. This skill NEVER writes into `.atlas-ai/customizations/` — that's user
   territory.
2. Phase skills read `.atlas-ai/customizations/` as a fallback *after* the
   curated `atlas.json` but *before* documented defaults.
3. When a user asks for a setting not covered by curated questions, the AI
   proposes a customization file shape, the user edits, and the AI verifies
   the file parses.

## Critical Rules

1. Never ask the user to edit JSON directly — the skill asks curated questions
   and writes the file.
2. Questions are curated and AI-adapted, not a fixed form — adapt follow-ups
   to earlier answers.
3. Every answer is validated before being written (`validate-answer`).
4. Config is idempotent — re-running updates cleanly.
5. Config is per-project (lives in `.atlas-ai/config/`), not global.
6. Customization files live in `.atlas-ai/customizations/` and are
   user-authored — this skill never overwrites them.
7. Phase skills must GRACEFULLY FALL BACK to documented defaults when config
   keys are missing.
