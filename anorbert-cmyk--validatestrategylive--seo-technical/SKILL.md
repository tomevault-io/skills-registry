# SEO Technical Skill

## Purpose

Audit the technical SEO foundation of a website across 9 critical categories. Technical SEO determines whether search engines can discover, crawl, render, and index content correctly. This skill identifies infrastructure-level issues that block or degrade organic visibility.

---

## Category 1: Crawlability

### Standard Crawler Management

| Check | Pass Criteria | Severity |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| robots.txt exists | Returns 200, valid syntax | Critical |
| robots.txt not blocking key pages | Sitemap, homepage, key landing pages accessible | Critical |
| XML sitemap exists | Referenced in robots.txt or at /sitemap.xml | High |
| Sitemap is valid | Well-formed XML, all URLs return 200 | High |
| Sitemap size | Under 50MB uncompressed; under 50,000 URLs per file | Medium |
| Sitemap index | Used if more than 50,000 URLs | Medium |
| Crawl depth | Key pages within 3 clicks of homepage | High |
| Internal linking | No orphan pages (pages with 0 internal links pointing to them) | High |
| Redirect chains | No chains longer than 2 hops | Medium |
| Redirect loops | Zero redirect loops | Critical |

### AI Crawler Management

Modern SEO must account for AI crawlers that scrape content for training and retrieval-augmented generation. Managing these crawlers is both a content protection and an AI search visibility decision.

#### AI Crawler Tokens

| Crawler | Owner | User-Agent Token | robots.txt Directive |
|---------|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| GPTBot | OpenAI | `GPTBot` | `User-agent: GPTBot` |
| ChatGPT-User | OpenAI | `ChatGPT-User` | `User-agent: ChatGPT-User` |
| OAI-SearchBot | OpenAI | `OAI-SearchBot` | `User-agent: OAI-SearchBot` |
| ClaudeBot | Anthropic | `ClaudeBot` | `User-agent: ClaudeBot` |
| anthropic-ai | Anthropic | `anthropic-ai` | `User-agent: anthropic-ai` |
| PerplexityBot | Perplexity | `PerplexityBot` | `User-agent: PerplexityBot` |
| Bytespider | ByteDance | `Bytespider` | `User-agent: Bytespider` |
| Applebot-Extended | Apple | `Applebot-Extended` | `User-agent: Applebot-Extended` |
| Google-Extended | Google | `Google-Extended` | `User-agent: Google-Extended` |
| FacebookBot | Meta | `FacebookExternalHit` | `User-agent: FacebookExternalHit` |
| cohere-ai | Cohere | `cohere-ai` | `User-agent: cohere-ai` |
| Diffbot | Diffbot | `Diffbot` | `User-agent: Diffbot` |
| Amazonbot | Amazon | `Amazonbot` | `User-agent: Amazonbot` |
| YouBot | You.com | `YouBot` | `User-agent: YouBot` |

#### AI Crawler Strategy Recommendations

| Strategy | When to Use | Implementation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Allow All** | Want maximum AI search visibility (citations, AI Overviews) | No blocks in robots.txt |
| **Allow Search, Block Training** | Want AI search citations but protect training data | Allow `OAI-SearchBot`, `ChatGPT-User`; Block `GPTBot`, `Google-Extended` |
| **Block All AI** | Protect proprietary content entirely | Block all AI tokens in robots.txt |
| **Selective Allow** | Allow specific AI platforms aligned with business | Whitelist approach: block all, then allow specific tokens |

#### Audit Checks

| Check | What to Verify | Severity |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| AI crawler directives present | robots.txt mentions at least some AI crawlers | Medium |
| Strategy is intentional | Not accidentally blocking AI search crawlers | High |
| Consistency | If blocking GPTBot, consider whether OAI-SearchBot should also be blocked | Medium |
| Content protection aligned | Blocking matches content licensing strategy | Medium |

---

## Category 2: Indexability

| Check | Pass Criteria | Severity |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| No unintended noindex | Key pages do not have `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` | Critical |
| Canonical tags present | All indexable pages have self-referencing canonical | High |
| Canonical consistency | Canonical URL matches actual URL (protocol, www/non-www, trailing slash) | High |
| No canonical conflicts | JavaScript-rendered canonical matches server-rendered canonical | Critical |
| Duplicate content | Content hash comparison; no substantial duplicates without canonical | High |
| Pagination handling | `rel="next"` / `rel="prev"` or load-more pattern (note: Google ignores these but Bing uses them) | Low |
| Thin content pages | Pages with <100 words flagged for review | Medium |
| Parameter handling | URL parameters not creating duplicate indexable pages | High |
| Index coverage | Compare indexed pages (via sitemap) vs crawled pages; identify gaps | High |

---

## Category 3: Security Headers

| Header | Recommended Value | Severity |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` | High |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Medium |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` | Medium |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Appropriate policy (not overly permissive) | Medium |

| Logical hierarchy | URL path reflects site architecture (`/category/subcategory/page`) | Low |

---

## Category 5: Mobile Optimization

### Mobile-First Indexing (Fully Enforced July 2024)

Google uses the mobile version of content for indexing and ranking for all sites. Desktop-only content that is not present on mobile will not be indexed.

| Check | Pass Criteria | Severity |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Responsive design | Uses viewport meta tag, CSS media queries | Critical |
| Mobile content parity | Same content on mobile and desktop versions | Critical |

| Dynamic rendering or SSR for key pages | If SPA, ensure prerendering for search engines | High |
| Hydration does not alter SEO elements | React/Vue hydration does not change title, canonical, or meta tags | Critical |
| `<noscript>` fallback | Alternative content or message for no-JS scenarios | Low |

#### SPA-Specific Checks

| Check | Pass Criteria | Severity |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Prerender middleware active | Serves static HTML to bots (Googlebot, social crawlers) | Critical |
| Route-level meta injection | Server injects unique meta tags per route before sending HTML | Critical |
| Client-side routing generates crawlable URLs | History API (not hash-based routing) | High |
| Lazy-loaded content is crawlable | Content within viewport or accessible via scrolling | Medium |
| JavaScript errors do not break rendering | Error boundaries prevent blank pages | High |

---

## Category 9: IndexNow Protocol

IndexNow enables instant notification to search engines when content changes, rather than waiting for crawlers to discover updates.

| Submission on publish | New/updated content triggers IndexNow ping | Low |
| Batch submissions | Bulk URL submission for large content updates | Low |

### IndexNow Implementation

```
POST https://api.indexnow.org/indexnow
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "host": "example.com",
  "key": "your-api-key",
  "keyLocation": "https://example.com/your-api-key.txt",
  "urlList": [
    "https://example.com/new-page",
    "https://example.com/updated-page"
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- Core Web Vitals thresholds are based on 75th percentile of page loads
- INP officially replaced FID as a Core Web Vital in March 2024
- Mobile-first indexing was fully enforced for all sites as of July 2024
- Google's December 2025 guidance emphasizes canonical consistency between server-rendered and client-rendered HTML
- IndexNow is optional but beneficial for Bing; Google does not participate in IndexNow
- AI crawler management is an emerging discipline; strategies should be reviewed quarterly as the landscape evolves
- Security headers are ranked by SEO impact (HTTPS is critical; CSP is medium) rather than pure security severity
