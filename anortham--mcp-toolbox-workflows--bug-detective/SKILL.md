# Bug Detective Workflow

## Purpose
Conduct **systematic, methodical bug investigations** using detective-style debugging. This workflow combines Sherpa's bug hunt phases, Julie's execution tracing, and Goldfish's investigation logging to find and fix bugs confidently.

## When to Activate
Use when the user:
- **Reports bugs**: "this is broken", "getting an error", "not working"
- **Debugs issues**: "debug this", "find the bug", "why is this failing"
- **Investigates problems**: "investigate this error", "track down this issue"
- **Unexpected behavior**: "this should work but doesn't", "weird behavior"

## The Detective Trinity

### 🕵️ Sherpa - Investigation Guidance
- 4-phase bug hunt workflow
- Detective metaphors and encouragement
- Systematic process
- Progress tracking

### 🔍 Julie - Code Investigation Tools
- Semantic error search
- Execution path tracing
- Cross-language navigation
- Reference finding

### 📝 Goldfish - Investigation Log
- Checkpoint discoveries
- Document hypotheses
- Track investigation steps
- Preserve solution

## Bug Detective Orchestration

### Session Start: Check Previous Investigations
```
1. Goldfish recall({ search: "[error/bug description]" })
   → See if similar bug investigated before
2. Learn from previous investigations
3. If same bug → Resume investigation
4. If new → Start fresh investigation
```

### Phase 1: 🔍 Reproduce & Isolate

**Sherpa Activation:**
```
approach({ workflow: "bug-hunt" })
guide() → "Phase 1: Reproduce & Isolate - Find the crime scene!"
```

**Error Discovery:**
User reports: "Getting 'Invalid token' error"

**Julie Investigation:**
```
fast_search({ query: "Invalid token", mode: "lines" })
→ Find all error message locations

fast_goto on error location
→ Jump to where error is thrown

trace_call_path({ symbol: "validateToken", direction: "upstream" })
→ See what calls this (who triggers the error?)
```

**Reproduce Reliably:**
- Identify exact steps to trigger
- Determine consistent vs intermittent
- Gather error messages and stack traces
- Understand expected vs actual behavior

**Goldfish Investigation Log:**
```
checkpoint({
  description: "Isolated 'Invalid token' error: thrown in validateToken() when refresh tokens expire, called from authenticate() middleware",
  tags: ["bug-hunt", "investigation", "phase-1", "auth"]
})
```

**Sherpa Progress:**
```
guide({ done: "reproduced bug: token validation fails with expired refresh tokens" })
→ 🕵️ "Excellent detective work! The case is taking shape..."
→ "Phase 2: Capture in Test"
```

### Phase 2: ✅ Capture in Test

**Sherpa Guidance:**
```
guide() → "Phase 2: Capture in Test - Document the crime!"
```

**Julie Pattern Search:**
```
fast_search({ query: "token validation test examples", mode: "semantic" })
→ Find similar test patterns

get_symbols({ file: "tests/auth.test.ts", mode: "structure" })
→ See existing test structure
```

**Write Failing Test:**
- Reproduce bug in test
- Verify test fails for the right reason
- Document expected behavior
- Ensure test is clear and minimal

**Run test → Fails (as expected!)**

**Goldfish Checkpoint:**
```
checkpoint({
  description: "Created failing test: 'should handle expired refresh tokens gracefully' - reproduces Invalid token error",
  tags: ["bug-hunt", "test", "phase-2", "auth"]
})
```

**Sherpa Progress:**
```
guide({ done: "wrote failing test that reproduces the expired token bug" })
→ 🎯 "Perfect! You've documented the crime. Now let's solve it!"
→ "Phase 3: Fix the Bug"
```

### Phase 3: 🔧 Fix the Bug

**Sherpa Guidance:**
```
guide() → "Phase 3: Fix - Solve the mystery!"
```

**Julie Code Understanding:**
```
get_symbols({ file: "src/auth/jwt.ts", mode: "full" })
→ Understand token validation logic

trace_call_path({ symbol: "validateToken", direction: "downstream" })
→ See what validateToken calls (jwt.verify, etc.)

fast_refs({ symbol: "refreshToken" })
→ See all refresh token usage
```

**Analysis:**
- Root cause: Not checking refresh token expiration
- Solution: Add expiration check before validation
- Impact: Minimal, isolated to validateToken

**Implement Fix:**
```typescript
// Add expiration check
if (isRefreshTokenExpired(token)) {
  throw new TokenExpiredError('Refresh token expired');
}
```

**Run test → Passes! ✅**

**Goldfish Checkpoint:**
```
checkpoint({
  description: "Fixed expired token bug: added expiration check in validateToken, test now passes",
  tags: ["bug-hunt", "fix", "phase-3", "auth", "test-pass"]
})
```

**Sherpa Progress:**
```
guide({ done: "implemented fix for expired tokens, failing test now passes" })
→ 🎉 "Case solved! The bug has been caught!"
→ "Phase 4: Verify & Prevent"
```

### Phase 4: ✅ Verify & Prevent

**Sherpa Guidance:**
```
guide() → "Phase 4: Verify - Close the case with confidence!"
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. **Run all tests** → Ensure no regressions
2. **Test manually** → Verify actual bug fixed
3. **Check edge cases** → Add more tests if needed

**Julie Impact Analysis:**
```
fast_refs({ symbol: "validateToken" })
→ See all usage points (15 locations)
→ Verify fix doesn't break anything
```

**Prevention:**
- Add tests for related scenarios
- Document the fix
- Update error messages for clarity

**Goldfish Final Checkpoint:**
```
checkpoint({
  description: "Bug hunt complete: expired token handling fixed and verified. Added 3 additional tests for edge cases. All 18 auth tests passing.",
  tags: ["bug-hunt", "complete", "phase-4", "auth", "verified"]
})
```

**Sherpa Completion:**
```
guide({ done: "verified fix across all test cases, added prevention tests, all tests green" })
→ 🌟 "Bug Hunt Complete! Detective work at its finest!"
→ Potential milestone: "🏆 Milestone: Bug Detective Mastery!"
```

## Complete Example: Race Condition Bug

```markdown
User: "Users are getting randomly logged out"

=== SESSION START ===

→ Goldfish: recall({ search: "logout session" })
  No previous investigation. New case!

=== PHASE 1: REPRODUCE & ISOLATE ===

→ Sherpa: approach({ workflow: "bug-hunt" })
  🕵️ Bug Hunt Workflow activated!

→ Sherpa: guide()
  "Phase 1: Reproduce & Isolate"

→ Julie: fast_search({ query: "logout session destroy", mode: "semantic" })
  Found: session.ts, auth-middleware.ts

→ Julie: trace_call_path({ symbol: "logout", direction: "both" })
  Execution flow:
  - logout() calls session.destroy()
  - authenticate() checks session.exists()
  - Race condition: destroy happens while checking!

→ Goldfish: checkpoint({
    description: "Isolated race condition: session.destroy() can execute during session.exists() check, causing random logouts",
    tags: ["bug-hunt", "investigation", "race-condition"]
  })

→ Sherpa: guide({ done: "found race condition between session destroy and exists check" })
  🕵️ "Aha! A race condition! Classic mystery..."

=== PHASE 2: CAPTURE IN TEST ===

→ Sherpa: guide()
  "Phase 2: Capture in Test"

→ Write test with concurrent operations:
  - Simulate logout during auth check
  - Reproduce race condition
  - Test fails (intermittently - race condition!)

→ Goldfish: checkpoint({
    description: "Created failing test: 'should handle concurrent logout during auth' - reproduces race condition",
    tags: ["bug-hunt", "test", "phase-2", "race-condition"]
  })

→ Sherpa: guide({ done: "wrote test that reproduces race condition" })
  🎯 "Documented the crime!"

=== PHASE 3: FIX THE BUG ===

→ Sherpa: guide()
  "Phase 3: Fix the Bug"

→ Julie: get_symbols({ file: "src/session.ts", mode: "full" })
  Understand session management

→ Solution: Add mutex/lock for session operations

→ Implement fix with proper locking

→ Test passes consistently! ✅

→ Goldfish: checkpoint({
    description: "Fixed race condition: added mutex for session operations, test now passes consistently",
    tags: ["bug-hunt", "fix", "phase-3", "race-condition"]
  })

→ Sherpa: guide({ done: "fixed race condition with mutex, test passes" })
  🎉 "Mystery solved!"

=== PHASE 4: VERIFY & PREVENT ===

→ Sherpa: guide()
  "Phase 4: Verify & Prevent"

→ Run full test suite → All pass ✅
→ Stress test with 100 concurrent operations → Stable! ✅

→ Julie: fast_refs({ symbol: "session" })
  Check all session usage → All safe

→ Goldfish: checkpoint({
    description: "Race condition fix verified: stress tested with 100 concurrent ops, added 5 concurrency tests, all 23 session tests pass",
    tags: ["bug-hunt", "complete", "verified", "race-condition"]
  })

→ Sherpa: guide({ done: "verified fix under stress, added prevention tests" })
  🌟 "Bug Hunt Complete! Case closed!"
```

## Investigation Techniques

### Trace Execution Paths
```
trace_call_path shows WHO calls buggy code:
- Identify entry points
- See call chain
- Understand flow
```

### Semantic Error Search
```
fast_search for error patterns:
- Find related errors
- See similar issues
- Learn from fixes
```

### Reference Analysis
```
fast_refs shows WHERE code is used:
- Impact analysis
- Breaking change detection
- Edge case discovery
```

## Goldfish Investigation Patterns

### Discovery Checkpoints
```
checkpoint({
  description: "Discovered: [finding]",
  tags: ["discovery", "hypothesis"]
})
```

### Hypothesis Checkpoints
```
checkpoint({
  description: "Hypothesis: [theory about root cause]",
  tags: ["hypothesis", "analysis"]
})
```

### Solution Checkpoints
```
checkpoint({
  description: "Solution: [fix description]",
  tags: ["solution", "fix"]
})
```

**Benefit:** Investigation trail is preserved even across context resets!

## Key Behaviors

### ✅ DO
- Recall similar bugs at start
- Follow all 4 phases systematically
- Use Julie to trace execution
- Checkpoint discoveries immediately
- Write failing test before fixing
- Verify no regressions
- Document solution clearly

### ❌ DON'T
- Jump to conclusions without reproducing
- Skip writing test (defeats the purpose!)
- Fix without understanding root cause
- Ignore similar past bugs
- Forget to checkpoint investigation steps
- Skip verification phase

## Success Criteria

Bug Detective succeeds when:
- Bug reliably reproduced
- Captured in failing test
- Root cause understood
- Fix implemented and tested
- All tests pass (including new ones)
- Investigation documented
- Prevention measures in place

## Performance

- Julie trace_call_path: ~200ms
- Julie error search: <100ms
- Goldfish checkpoint: ~10ms
- Total investigation: Depends on bug complexity

**Result:** Systematic debugging that finds root causes fast!
