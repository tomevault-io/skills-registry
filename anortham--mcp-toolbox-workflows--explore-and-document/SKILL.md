# Explore and Document Workflow

## Purpose
**Systematically understand unfamiliar codebases** and preserve findings for future reference. Combines Julie's efficient code exploration, Sherpa's exploration workflow, and Goldfish's documentation persistence.

## When to Activate
- "understand this codebase", "explore this code"
- "how does this work?", "explain the architecture"
- "I'm new to this project", "onboard me"
- "document the structure", "map this codebase"

## Trinity for Exploration

**Julie:** Semantic search, symbol structure, call tracing (token-efficient!)
**Sherpa:** Exploration workflow phases (Learn → Investigate → Prototype → Document)
**Goldfish:** Checkpoint discoveries, document architecture via plans

## Orchestration

### Phase 1: Learn the Landscape (Julie + Sherpa)
```
approach({ workflow: "exploration" })
guide() → "Phase 1: Learn - Understand the landscape"

Julie exploration:
- fast_explore() → Overall architecture
- fast_search → Find key components
- get_symbols → File structures (70-90% token savings!)

checkpoint({ description: "Mapped architecture: [layers/components found]" })
guide({ done: "understood overall architecture" })
```

### Phase 2: Investigate Patterns (Julie + Sherpa)
```
guide() → "Phase 2: Investigate - Dig deeper into patterns"

Julie investigation:
- trace_call_path → Understand execution flows
- fast_refs → See usage patterns
- Semantic search → Find related code

checkpoint({ description: "Investigated [feature]: uses [pattern], connects to [components]" })
guide({ done: "mapped key patterns and relationships" })
```

### Phase 3: Prototype Understanding (Optional)
```
guide() → "Phase 3: Prototype - Try things out"

Optional: Write small test code to verify understanding

checkpoint({ description: "Verified understanding: [what was tested]" })
```

### Phase 4: Document Findings (Goldfish + Sherpa)
```
guide() → "Phase 4: Document - Record your findings"

Create architecture documentation plan:
plan({
  action: "save",
  title: "[Codebase] Architecture Analysis",
  content: "## Architecture...\n## Key Components...\n## Patterns..."
})

checkpoint({ description: "Documented [codebase] architecture and patterns" })
guide({ done: "documentation complete" })
```

## Example: Exploring New Codebase

```markdown
User: "Help me understand this authentication system"

PHASE 1: LEARN
→ approach({ workflow: "exploration" })
→ fast_search({ query: "authentication", mode: "semantic" })
  Found: auth.ts, jwt.ts, user-service.ts

→ get_symbols on each (token-efficient!)
  - auth.ts: AuthMiddleware class
  - jwt.ts: JWT utilities
  - user-service.ts: User management

→ checkpoint({ description: "Auth system has 3 layers: middleware, JWT utils, user service" })

PHASE 2: INVESTIGATE
→ trace_call_path({ symbol: "authenticate", direction: "downstream" })
  Flow: authenticate → validateToken → jwt.verify → UserService.findById

→ fast_refs({ symbol: "authenticate" })
  Used in: 15 routes across api.ts, admin.ts

→ checkpoint({ description: "Auth flow: JWT middleware validates tokens via UserService, protects 15 routes" })

PHASE 4: DOCUMENT
→ plan({
    action: "save",
    title: "Authentication System Architecture",
    content: "## Overview\nJWT-based authentication...\n## Components\n..."
  })

→ checkpoint({ description: "Documented auth system architecture with flow diagrams" })

Result: Complete understanding documented, survives context resets!
```

## Token Efficiency Pattern

**Traditional exploration:**
```
Read auth.ts (500 lines) → 12,000 tokens
Read jwt.ts (300 lines) → 7,200 tokens
Read user-service.ts (600 lines) → 14,400 tokens
Total: 33,600 tokens!
```

**Julie-powered exploration:**
```
get_symbols(auth.ts, mode="structure") → 800 tokens
get_symbols(jwt.ts, mode="structure") → 500 tokens
get_symbols(user-service.ts, mode="structure") → 900 tokens
Total: 2,200 tokens (93% savings!)
```

## Goldfish Documentation Patterns

**Architecture Plans:**
```
plan({
  title: "[System] Architecture",
  tags: ["architecture", "documentation"],
  content: "## Layers\n## Components\n## Patterns\n## Data Flow"
})
```

**Discovery Checkpoints:**
```
checkpoint({
  description: "Discovered: [finding]",
  tags: ["exploration", "discovery", "architecture"]
})
```

**Pattern Documentation:**
```
checkpoint({
  description: "Pattern: [name] - [description]",
  tags: ["pattern", "architecture"]
})
```

## Key Behaviors

**✅ DO:**
- Start with semantic search
- Use get_symbols for structure (massive token savings!)
- Trace execution paths
- Document incrementally in Goldfish
- Create architecture plan
- Let Sherpa guide phases

**❌ DON'T:**
- Read entire files without checking symbols first
- Skip documentation (defeats the purpose!)
- Forget to trace execution flows
- Ignore Goldfish checkpointing

**Efficient exploration: Search semantically, explore efficiently, document persistently!**
