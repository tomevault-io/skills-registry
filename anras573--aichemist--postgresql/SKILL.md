# PostgreSQL Query Skill

This skill provides PostgreSQL database querying capabilities. **Read operations execute automatically. Write operations are BLOCKED by default** - the user must explicitly enable writes for the session.

## Prerequisites

### Environment Variable

The `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable must be set with a valid connection string:

```
postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

Example:
```bash
export POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb"
```

### psql Client

The `psql` command-line client must be installed:

**macOS:**
```bash
# Full PostgreSQL installation
brew install postgresql

# Client-only (lighter weight)
brew install libpq && brew link --force libpq
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client
```

**Linux (RHEL/CentOS):**
```bash
sudo yum install postgresql
```

### First-Run Check

On first use, verify prerequisites:

1. Check if `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable is set
2. Check if `psql` is available in PATH

If either is missing, explain the setup requirements and provide installation instructions.

## Quick Reference

### Operation Types

| Type | Operations | Behavior |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Read** | SELECT, EXPLAIN (without ANALYZE on writes), \d commands | Automatic - no confirmation needed |
| **Write** | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE, ALTER, CREATE, COPY, GRANT, REVOKE, REFRESH, CALL, DO | **BLOCKED by default** |
| **Admin** | pg_cancel_backend, pg_terminate_backend, VACUUM, REINDEX, CLUSTER | **Requires confirmation** |

### Read Operations (Automatic)

- `SELECT` queries (except those with side-effect functions)
- `EXPLAIN` queries (without `ANALYZE` on write statements—see note below)
- `\d` - describe table structure
- `\dt` - list tables
- `\di` - list indexes
- `\dv` - list views
- `\dn` - list schemas
- `\df` - list functions
- `\du` - list roles

### Write Operations (Blocked by Default)

The following operations are **blocked** unless the user explicitly enables writes:

- `INSERT` - add data
- `UPDATE` - modify data
- `DELETE` - remove data
- `DROP` - drop objects
- `TRUNCATE` - empty tables
- `ALTER` - modify schema
- `CREATE` - create objects
- `COPY` - import/export data (can write files)
- `GRANT` / `REVOKE` - modify permissions
- `COMMENT` - modify metadata
- `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` - rewrites materialized view data
- `CALL` - executes stored procedures (can perform writes)
- `DO` - executes anonymous code blocks (can perform any operation)

**IMPORTANT:** `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` actually executes the query. If the analyzed query is a write operation (e.g., `EXPLAIN ANALYZE DELETE FROM users`), it **will execute the deletion**. Treat `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` + write statement as a write operation.

### Administrative Operations (Confirmation Required)

These operations use SELECT syntax but have side effects:

- `pg_cancel_backend(pid)` - cancels a running query (disruptive)
- `pg_terminate_backend(pid)` - terminates a connection (disruptive)
- `VACUUM` - reclaims storage, can lock tables
- `REINDEX` - rebuilds indexes, can lock tables
- `CLUSTER` - reorders table data, requires exclusive lock

Always confirm before executing these, even if writes are not enabled.

### Transaction Commands

Transaction control commands (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `START TRANSACTION`) have limited utility with this skill because each `psql -c` invocation uses a **separate connection**. Transaction state is not preserved between calls. If transaction support is needed, inform the user of this limitation.

**To enable writes**, the user must explicitly request it:
- "enable writes"
- "I want to modify data"
- "allow write operations"
- "enable database modifications"

## Query Execution

### Basic Query Pattern

Use the Bash tool to execute queries via psql. Use **single quotes** around the query to prevent shell injection:

```bash
psql "$POSTGRES_URL" --no-password -c 'YOUR_QUERY_HERE'
```

**Security Note:** Always use single quotes around SQL queries to prevent shell command injection. With double quotes, malicious input containing backticks or `$()` could execute arbitrary shell commands. For queries that need single quotes internally, escape them as `''` (two single quotes) which is standard SQL escaping.

### Output Formats

**Default (Markdown tables):**
```bash
psql "$POSTGRES_URL" --no-password -t -A -F $'\t' -c 'SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5'
```

Then format the tab-delimited output as a markdown table. Using tab (`$'\t'`) instead of pipe avoids issues when data contains pipe characters. When converting to markdown, escape any literal `|` in the data as `\|`.

**JSON output (when requested):**
```bash
psql "$POSTGRES_URL" --no-password -t -A -c 'SELECT row_to_json(t) FROM (SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5) t'
```

### Useful psql Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-c 'query'` | Execute single query (use single quotes!) |
| `--no-password` | Never prompt for password (use connection string) |
| `-t` | Tuples only (no headers/footers) |
| `-A` | Unaligned output (no padding) |
| `-F $'\t'` | Set field separator (tab recommended) |
| `-x` | Expanded output (one column per line) |

## Core Workflows

### Listing Tables

```bash
psql "$POSTGRES_URL" --no-password -c '\dt'
```

### Describing a Table

```bash
psql "$POSTGRES_URL" --no-password -c '\d table_name'
```

### Running SELECT Queries

```bash
# Get data with markdown-friendly output
psql "$POSTGRES_URL" --no-password -t -A -F $'\t' -c 'SELECT id, name, email FROM users LIMIT 10'
```

Format result as:

```markdown
| id | name | email |
|----|------|-------|
| 1 | Alice | alice@example.com |
| 2 | Bob | bob@example.com |
```

### Explaining Query Plans

```bash
# EXPLAIN without ANALYZE (safe - doesn't execute the query)
psql "$POSTGRES_URL" --no-password -c 'EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = ''active'''

# EXPLAIN ANALYZE (executes the query - safe only for SELECT)
psql "$POSTGRES_URL" --no-password -c 'EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = ''active'''
```

**Warning:** Never use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` with write statements unless writes are enabled and you intend to execute them. `EXPLAIN ANALYZE DELETE FROM users` will actually delete rows!

## Write Operations Workflow

### Detecting Write Operations

Before executing any query, check if it contains write-related keywords:

**Data-modifying statements:**
- `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `ALTER`, `CREATE`
- `COPY`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `COMMENT`
- `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`, `CALL`, `DO`

**Special cases:**
- `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` + any of the above = treat as write operation
- `pg_cancel_backend`, `pg_terminate_backend` = require confirmation (admin ops)
- `VACUUM`, `REINDEX`, `CLUSTER` = require confirmation (admin ops)

Use case-insensitive matching and handle queries that start with these keywords or contain them after CTEs (`WITH`).

**Note on `DO`:** Only treat `DO` as a write keyword when it appears as a leading statement keyword (at the beginning of the query or after a CTE), to avoid false positives with the common word "do" in other contexts.

### When Writes Are Blocked

If a write operation is detected and writes are not enabled:

```markdown
**Write operation blocked**

The query contains a write operation (`DELETE`), which is blocked by default for safety.

To enable write operations for this session, say:
- "enable writes" or
- "I want to modify data"

Then retry your query.
```

### Enabling Writes

When the user explicitly enables writes, acknowledge it:

```markdown
**Write operations enabled** for this session.

I'll ask for confirmation before executing any data-modifying queries.
```

### Executing Write Operations (When Enabled)

When writes are enabled and a write query is requested:

1. **Preview** the operation
2. **Confirm** using AskUserQuestion
3. **Execute** only if confirmed
4. **Report** results

Example confirmation:

```markdown
I'm ready to execute this DELETE statement:

**Query:**
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE status = 'inactive' AND last_login < '2023-01-01'
```

This will permanently remove matching rows from the `users` table.
```

Use AskUserQuestion:
```
Question: "Execute this DELETE query?"
Options:
  - "Yes, execute it" - Proceed with deletion
  - "Show affected rows first" - Run SELECT with same WHERE clause
  - "Cancel" - Abort the operation
```

## Output Formatting

### Markdown Table Format (Default)

Convert psql output to readable markdown tables:

```markdown
| column1 | column2 | column3 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| value1  | value2  | value3  |
| value4  | value5  | value6  |
```

### JSON Format (On Request)

When user asks for JSON output:

```bash
psql "$POSTGRES_URL" --no-password -t -A -c 'SELECT json_agg(row_to_json(t)) FROM (SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5) t'
```

### Handling Large Result Sets

For queries returning many rows:
- When **generating** a simple SELECT query, include `LIMIT 100` if the user hasn't specified a limit
- Do **not** automatically inject LIMIT into user-provided SQL (could break subqueries, CTEs, aggregations)
- Inform user: "Showing first 100 rows. Add `LIMIT n` to see more or fewer."

### Handling NULL Values

Display NULL values clearly in output:
```markdown
| id | name | email |
|----|------|-------|
| 1 | Alice | alice@example.com |
| 2 | Bob | (NULL) |
```

## Error Handling

### Connection Errors

```
psql: error: connection to server failed
```

Suggest:
- Verify `POSTGRES_URL` is correctly set
- Check that the database server is running
- Verify network connectivity to the host
- Check firewall rules if connecting remotely

### Authentication Errors

```
psql: error: FATAL: password authentication failed
```

Suggest:
- Verify credentials in `POSTGRES_URL`
- Check if user has access to the specified database
- Verify pg_hba.conf allows the connection method

### Missing psql

```
psql: command not found
```

Provide installation instructions based on detected platform.

### Permission Errors

```
ERROR: permission denied for table users
```

Explain:
- Current database user lacks required permissions
- Contact database administrator to grant access

## Security Notes

- Never log or display the full `POSTGRES_URL` (contains password)
- Use `$POSTGRES_URL` in commands (shell expansion hides value)
- Write operations require explicit opt-in for safety
- Always confirm destructive operations before execution
