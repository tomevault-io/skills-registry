# Mnemos for Codex

Use this skill to put Mnemos on the supported Codex path without overstating host automation. In Codex, the practical Mnemos workflow is:

- recall at the start of substantial work
- curate durable facts during or after the task
- consolidate before finishing

## Default path

- Prefer `pip install "mnemos-memory[mcp]"` and `mnemos ui`.
- Treat the blessed Codex setup as two parts: MCP config plus a repo-level `AGENTS.md` memory block.
- Read `references/install.md` for install and validation.
- Read `references/operations.md` for daily use, troubleshooting, and honest capability framing.

## Claim discipline

- Safe to claim: Mnemos works in Codex through MCP, shared `MNEMOS_CONFIG_PATH`, repo-level `AGENTS.md`, and optional maintenance Automations.
- Do not claim built-in prompt/tool lifecycle hooks or Claude Code parity.
- Hard auto-capture in Codex is host-dependent and not shipped by Mnemos today.

## Daily loop

1. Start in recall mode: call `mnemos_retrieve` with a task-focused query and repo-scoped arguments.
2. Do the work, then switch to curator mode: store only durable facts with `mnemos_store`.
3. Use `mnemos_inspect` before storing a correction or when a retrieved memory looks suspicious.
4. Finish substantial work with `mnemos_consolidate`.
5. If Mnemos MCP tools are unavailable, continue normally instead of blocking work.

## Recall mode

- Use at the start of coding, debugging, review, or handoff tasks.
- Query for architecture, current repo conventions, recent fixes, environment quirks, and user preferences that matter for this task.
- In Codex, prefer `current_scope=project`, `scope_id=<workspace or repo name>`, and `allowed_scopes=project,global`.

## Curator mode

- Use during or near the end of a substantial task.
- Store decisions, constraints, environment facts, recurring bug patterns, and stable preferences.
- Skip one-off chatter, ephemeral plans, stack traces without reusable lessons, and secrets.

## Avoid

- Do not present Codex Automations as session capture.
- Do not tell users to type memories manually as the primary workflow.
- Do not market Codex as Tier 1 until real daily-use validation is complete.
