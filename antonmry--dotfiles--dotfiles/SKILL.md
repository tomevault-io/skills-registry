# Dotfiles Management Skill

Manage dotfiles stored in `~/.dotfiles` using dotter.

## Structure

- `~/.dotfiles/` - Main dotfiles repository
- `~/.dotfiles/.dotter/global.toml` - Dotter configuration with symlink mappings
- `~/.dotfiles/bin/` - Custom scripts (symlinked to `~/bin/`)
- `~/.dotfiles/config/` - Config files (symlinked to `~/.config/`)

## Machines

- **Gali10** - Linux machine
- **Gali11** - macOS machine

Files should work cross-platform (Linux and macOS) unless specifically targeting one.

## Security Guidelines

- Never store secrets, API keys, or credentials in dotfiles
- Check for sensitive data before adding new files
- Use environment variables or separate secret management for credentials

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `config/claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in the dotfiles repo
2. Add a mapping in `.dotter/global.toml`:
   ```toml
   "config/claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md" = "~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md"
   ```
3. Run `dotter deploy` — the post-deploy hook auto-copies all skills to `~/.codex/skills/`
4. Avoid `\{{` handlebars syntax in SKILL.md files — dotter parses them as templates. Escape with `\{{`.

## Workflow

1. Edit files in `~/.dotfiles/`
2. Add new files to `~/.dotfiles/.dotter/global.toml`
3. Run `dotter deploy` to create symlinks
4. User handles git commits (never commit automatically)

## Dotter Config Format

```toml
[default.files]
"source/path" = "~/destination/path"
```

## Proactive Suggestions

When modifying config files, suggest:
- Adding them to dotfiles if not already tracked
- Cross-platform compatibility improvements
- Security checks for sensitive data
