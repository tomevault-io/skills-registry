# Rust — best practices

## Idioms and tooling

- Treat **compiler + Clippy** as part of the review: new warnings or denies should be resolved, not accumulated.
- For **where** format and lint flags live (CI, aliases, allow policy), see [rust-linter-configuration/SKILL.md](../rust-linter-configuration/SKILL.md).
- Use **type-driven design**: let the type system encode states (e.g. builder, sealed traits, newtypes) instead of runtime checks alone.
- Prefer **explicit error types** at boundaries; map to domain errors inside the core rather than leaking `io::Error` everywhere.

## Checklist

- [ ] API takes the weakest ownership (`&`, `&mut`, `AsRef`) that still works?
- [ ] No `unwrap`/`expect` on paths that can fail in production?
- [ ] Every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:` note and minimal scope?
- [ ] Async code does not hold `MutexGuard` or other non-`Send` state across `.await`?
- [ ] New `pub` items have a one-line doc when behavior is not obvious from the name?

## Async and concurrency

- Document or bound **spawn** sites with the same care as public functions (`Send`, `'static` where required).
- Prefer structured concurrency (scoped tasks, clear shutdown) over fire-and-forget where lifecycle matters.

## When in doubt

Prefer code that a mid-level Rust reader understands without reading three layers of macros.
