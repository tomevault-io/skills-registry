description: [TMUX MODE] Delegate implementation to Codex via tmux file-based IPC. Only use when user explicitly runs /codex-implement command. For natural language requests, use the delegate_codex_implement MCP tool instead. Use when this capability is needed.

# Codex Implement Skill

Delegate complex implementation tasks to the Codex agent for high-quality code.

## When to Use

- Complex multi-file implementations
- Algorithms requiring careful design
- User explicitly wants Codex to implement

## Steps

### 0. Check for Tmux

First, verify we're running in tmux. Run this check:

```bash
[ -n "$TMUX" ] && echo "TMUX_OK" || echo "NOT_IN_TMUX"
```

**If NOT_IN_TMUX**: Stop immediately and tell the user:
> "This skill requires tmux dual-pane mode. You're not in tmux.
>
> Instead, just ask me naturally: **'implement this with codex'** and I'll use the MCP tool which works without tmux."

Do not proceed with the remaining steps if not in tmux.

### 1. Resolve .agent-collab Directory

Before any file operations, resolve the `.agent-collab` directory so commands work outside the project root:

```bash
AGENT_COLLAB_DIR="${AGENT_COLLAB_DIR:-}"
if [ -n "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR" ]; then
  if [ -d "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/.agent-collab" ]; then
    AGENT_COLLAB_DIR="$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/.agent-collab"
  elif [ ! -d "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR" ]; then
    AGENT_COLLAB_DIR=""
  fi
fi

if [ -z "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR" ]; then
  AGENT_COLLAB_DIR="$(pwd)"
  while [ "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR" != "/" ] && [ ! -d "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/.agent-collab" ]; do
    AGENT_COLLAB_DIR="$(dirname "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR")"
  done
  AGENT_COLLAB_DIR="$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/.agent-collab"
fi
```

If `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR` does not exist, stop and ask for the project root.

### 2. Gather Requirements

From user, collect:
- What needs implementing
- Target file paths
- Constraints and patterns to follow
- Dependencies and interfaces

### 3. Create Implementation Spec

Write to `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/requests/task.md`:

```markdown
# Task Request for Codex

## Task Type: IMPLEMENT

## Timestamp
[Current timestamp]

## Implementation Request
[Detailed description]

## Target Files
- Primary: [FULL ABSOLUTE path, e.g. /Users/antor/project/src/feature.cpp]
- Secondary: [supporting file paths]

## Requirements
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
...

## Interfaces & Contracts
[Interfaces the code must satisfy]

## Context Files to Read
[List FULL ABSOLUTE paths of existing files Codex should read for context]

**NOTE: Codex runs in the same working directory and CAN read files directly.
Do NOT copy file contents here. Just list paths and Codex will read them.**

## Patterns to Follow
[Reference existing patterns by file path]

## Constraints
- [List constraints]
```

### 4. Update Status

Write `pending` to `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/status`

### 5. Trigger Codex

```bash
tmux send-keys -t 1 '$read-task' && sleep 0.5 && tmux send-keys -t 1 Enter Enter
```

### 6. Notify User

Tell user briefly that implementation was delegated to Codex.

### 7. Wait for Codex (Background Polling)

Start a background polling loop to wait for Codex to complete. Run this EXACT bash command (with `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/status`) using the Bash tool with `run_in_background: true`:

```bash
while [ "$(cat "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/status")" != "done" ]; do sleep 5; done; echo "CODEX_COMPLETE"
```

Note: Use 5 second intervals since implementations take longer.

CRITICAL: Use the resolved `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/status` path so polling works outside the project root. Use background execution so you can continue helping the user while waiting.

### 8. Auto-Read Response

When poll completes, automatically:
1. Read `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/responses/response.md`
2. Present the implementation to user
3. Ask if user wants to integrate the code
4. Reset `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/status` to `idle`
