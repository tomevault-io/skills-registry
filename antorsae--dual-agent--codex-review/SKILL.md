description: [TMUX MODE] Send code to Codex via tmux file-based IPC. Only use when user explicitly runs /codex-review command. For natural language requests like 'review with codex', use the delegate_codex_review MCP tool instead. Use when this capability is needed.

# Codex Review Skill

Send code to the Codex agent (running in tmux pane 1) for deep code review.

## When to Use

- User wants thorough code review
- User says "codex review" or "delegate review"
- Complex code needs security/bug analysis

## Steps

### 0. Check for Tmux

First, verify we're running in tmux. Run this check:

```bash
[ -n "$TMUX" ] && echo "TMUX_OK" || echo "NOT_IN_TMUX"
```

**If NOT_IN_TMUX**: Stop immediately and tell the user:
> "This skill requires tmux dual-pane mode. You're not in tmux.
>
> Instead, just ask me naturally: **'review this code with codex'** and I'll use the MCP tool which works without tmux."

Do not proceed with the remaining steps if not in tmux.

### 1. Resolve .agent-collab Directory

Before any file operations, resolve the `.agent-collab` directory so commands work outside the project root:

```bash
AGENT_COLLAB_DIR="${AGENT_COLLAB_DIR:-}"
if [ -n "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR" ]; then
  if [ -d "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/.agent-collab" ]; then
    AGENT_COLLAB_DIR="$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/.agent-collab"
  elif [ ! -d "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR" ]; then
    AGENT_COLLAB_DIR=""
  fi
fi

if [ -z "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR" ]; then
  AGENT_COLLAB_DIR="$(pwd)"
  while [ "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR" != "/" ] && [ ! -d "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/.agent-collab" ]; do
    AGENT_COLLAB_DIR="$(dirname "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR")"
  done
  AGENT_COLLAB_DIR="$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/.agent-collab"
fi
```

If `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR` does not exist, stop and ask for the project root.

### 2. Gather Code to Review

Ask user what to review if not specified:
- Specific file(s)
- Recent changes (git diff)
- A code block they provide

### 3. Write Task Request

Write to `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/requests/task.md`:

```markdown
# Task Request for Codex

## Task Type: CODE_REVIEW

## Timestamp
[Current timestamp]

## Files to Review
[List files with FULL ABSOLUTE paths, e.g. /Users/antor/project/src/main.cpp]

**NOTE: Codex runs in the same working directory and CAN read these files directly.
Do NOT copy file contents here. Just list the paths and Codex will read them.**

## Review Focus
- Look for bugs, edge cases, logic errors
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Identify performance issues
- Suggest improvements

## Specific Concerns
[Any areas user wants examined]
```

### 4. Update Status

Write `pending` to `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/status`

### 5. Trigger Codex

Run this bash command to trigger Codex in the other pane:

```bash
tmux send-keys -t 1 '$read-task' && sleep 0.5 && tmux send-keys -t 1 Enter Enter
```

### 6. Notify User

Tell user briefly that the review was delegated to Codex.

### 7. Wait for Codex (Background Polling)

Start a background polling loop to wait for Codex to complete. Run this EXACT bash command (with `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/status`) using the Bash tool with `run_in_background: true`:

```bash
while [ "$(cat "$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/status")" != "done" ]; do sleep 3; done; echo "CODEX_COMPLETE"
```

CRITICAL: Use the resolved `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/status` path so polling works outside the project root. Use background execution so you can continue helping the user while waiting.

### 8. Auto-Read Response

When the background poll completes (returns "CODEX_COMPLETE"), automatically:
1. Read `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/responses/response.md`
2. Present findings to user with clear formatting
3. Reset `$AGENT_COLLAB_DIR/status` to `idle`

This should happen seamlessly - user sees the delegation message, then later sees the results appear automatically.
