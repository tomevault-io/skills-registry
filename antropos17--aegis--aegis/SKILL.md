description: AEGIS-specific post-task gate — runs format:check, build:renderer, lint, then stages only the files changed by the task (never `-A`), conventional commit, push to the current feature branch (never master). Use when the user says "commit and push", "ship it", or "track this commit" inside the AEGIS project. Use when this capability is needed.

# Commit and Track

After completing any task:

1. npm run format:check — fix with npm run format if fails
2. npm run build:renderer — must pass 0 errors
3. npm run lint
4. List the files you changed during the task, then stage them by name:
   `git add <file1> <file2> ...`
   Never use `git add -A` / `git add .` — they sweep in untracked secrets, lock files, or unrelated work.
5. git commit -m "[type]: [description]"
   Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor
6. Push to the CURRENT feature branch — never master (it's branch-protected):
   `git push origin HEAD`
   This pushes the checked-out branch by name. NEVER `git push origin master`.
7. Report: files changed, errors fixed, status
