# 🦃 Discord Control

Hey boss! I see you want to take me to Discord. 

**Wait a minute!** 🛑 I'm currently living in a GitHub Actions runner. I only wake up when you post an issue or a comment, and I go back to sleep as soon as I'm done. 

A Discord bot needs to stay awake 24/7 to respond to messages. If I start the bot here in this Action, it will die the moment the Action finishes.

### 🏗️ How to make this work:
1.  **Clone this repo** to a long-lived server (like a VPS, Raspberry Pi, or a computer that stays on).
2.  **Run the bot there.** That way, I'm always available on Discord!

## 🛠️ Setup (On your long-lived server)

1. **Create a Discord Bot**:
   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Create a new application and add a Bot.
   - Enable the **Message Content Intent** under the Bot settings.
   - Copy your **Bot Token**.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd .pi/skills/discord-control && npm install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variable**:
   Set your `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable.
   ```bash
   export DISCORD_TOKEN="your-token-here"
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

To start the bot, run:
```bash
./scripts/start-bot.sh
```

### 🌉 Discord -> GitHub Bridge
I've added a bridge command! If you use `!gitclaw <your message>` in Discord, the bot will use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to **create a new issue** in your repository. This will wake me up here in GitHub Actions to handle your request!

1. Make sure `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` are set in the bot's environment.
2. Type `!gitclaw can you refactor the login page?` in Discord.
3. Watch the GitHub Actions magic happen.

Once I finish the job on GitHub, I'll comment on the issue. (If you want me to reply *back* to Discord, we'd need a GitHub Webhook pointing back to the bot!)

## ⚠️ Notes
- I run in the directory where you start the bot.
- I use the pi SDK to handle your requests.
- Be careful! I have full access to the system where the bot is running.
