# Effective Git for Agents

Git is our shared notebook and alarm system. Treat every command as communication to teammates and future you: explain the why, isolate the what, and leave a trail that is easy to audit.

## Cardinal Rules: Protect Others' Work

**NEVER discard, stash, or revert changes you don't recognize.** Another agent or the user may have made them.

### Forbidden Commands (unless explicitly instructed by user)

| Command | Why Forbidden |
|---------|---------------|
| `git stash` | Hides uncommitted work - may lose parallel agent's changes |
| `git checkout -- <file>` | Discards uncommitted changes permanently |
| `git restore <file>` | Same as above - destroys working changes |
| `git reset --hard` | Nuclear option - destroys ALL uncommitted work |
| `git clean -fd` | Removes untracked files - may delete new work |

### When You See Unrecognized Changes

**Default action: LEAVE THEM ALONE.**

```
Unrecognized change in git status
    │
    ├─► Is this blocking your current task?
    │       │
    │       ├─► NO → LEAVE IT ALONE. Continue your work.
    │       │
    │       └─► YES → ASK THE USER what to do. Never discard silently.
    │
    └─► Even if it looks wrong, preserve it.
        Lost work is worse than messy state.
```

### Safe Alternatives

Instead of discarding:
- **Commit it**: `git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: checkpoint unrecognized changes"`
- **Branch it**: `git checkout -b preserve-unknown-changes`
- **Leave it**: Just work around it - uncommitted changes won't affect your commits if you stage selectively

### Why This Matters

Multiple agents may work in the same session. Stashing or reverting "unknown" changes can destroy hours of work. The reflog won't help if changes were never committed. **When in doubt, preserve.**

## Core Principles

- **One idea per commit**: Each commit carries one idea and a reason; unrelated threads belong in separate commits.
- **Keep history safe**: Prefer additive fixes (`git revert`) over destructive rewrites (`git reset --hard`), and avoid editing others' changes.
- **Build and test**: The final commit series should pass verification; intermediate WIP commits are checkpoints, not deliverables.
- **Topic branches**: Work in small steps on a topic branch; keep main clean for integration.

## Two-Phase Development

Development happens in two phases: speed first, clarity second.

### Phase 1: Develop (Speed)

During implementation, commit checkpoints freely:

```bash
git commit -m "WIP: rough implementation"
git commit -m "WIP: fix that thing"
git commit -m "WIP: cleanup"
```

These are throwaway commits for safety, not communication. Don't waste time crafting messages—focus on making it work.

**Rules for Phase 1:**
- Commit frequently (every 15-30 minutes of work)
- Use "WIP:" prefix to mark throwaway commits
- Don't worry about atomic boundaries yet
- Verification not required on every commit

### Phase 2: Restructure (Clarity)

Before creating a PR, restructure into atomic commits:

```bash
# 1. Start interactive rebase against main
git rebase -i main

# 2. Squash WIP commits, split large commits, reorder for logical flow
# 3. Write meaningful messages for each atomic commit
# 4. Verify the final state
./verify.sh --agent
```

The final history tells a story a reviewer can follow.

**Rules for Phase 2:**
- Each commit tells one story
- Final commit series must pass verification
- Review your own history: `git log --oneline main..HEAD`

## The Atomic Commit Standard

### What Makes a Commit Atomic?

- **One logical change**: Add a function, fix a bug, refactor a module
- **Reviewable**: Can be understood in 5-10 minutes
- **Revertable**: Can be reverted without side effects
- **Self-contained**: Doesn't depend on "the next commit to fix it"

### Size Guidance

| Commit Type | Typical Lines | Example |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Typo/config | 1-10 | "Fix typo in README" |
| Bug fix | 5-50 | "Handle null case in parser" |
| Refactor | 20-100 | "Extract validation to helper" |
| New function | 30-150 | "Add createUser endpoint" |
| Large feature | Split into above | N/A - restructure it |

### Bad vs Good Examples

**Bad** (sweeping commit):
```
Add user authentication

- Add User model
- Add auth middleware
- Add login endpoint
- Add logout endpoint
- Add session management
- Fix typo in unrelated file
- Update tests
```

**Good** (atomic series):
```
1. Add User model with validation
2. Add session management utilities
3. Add auth middleware
4. Add login endpoint
5. Add logout endpoint
6. Add auth integration tests
```

Each commit in the good example can be reviewed independently, reverted if needed, and tells a clear story.

## Interactive Rebase

Interactive rebase is your primary tool for restructuring history.

### When to Use

| Scenario | Safe to Rewrite? |
|----------|------------------|
| Your feature branch before PR | ✅ YES |
| Local commits not yet pushed | ✅ YES |
| After `git commit --amend` (if not pushed) | ✅ YES |
| Anything on `main` | ❌ NO |
| Commits others are working on | ❌ NO |
| After PR is merged | ❌ NO |

### The Restructuring Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start interactive rebase against main
git rebase -i main

# 2. Editor opens with commit list - modify as needed
# 3. Save and close - git applies changes
# 4. Resolve any conflicts
# 5. Verify final state
./verify.sh --agent
```

### Rebase Commands

| Command | Effect | Use When |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `pick` | Keep commit as-is | Default, commit is good |
| `reword` | Keep commit, edit message | Message needs improvement |
| `edit` | Stop at commit | Need to split or modify content |
| `squash` | Combine with previous | Merge related commits, keep both messages |
| `fixup` | Combine with previous | Merge commits, drop this message |
| `drop` | Delete commit | Remove WIP or mistake |

### Example: Restructuring WIP Commits

Before (commit list in editor):
```
pick a1b2c3d WIP: start auth
pick e4f5g6h WIP: more auth stuff
pick i7j8k9l WIP: fix tests
pick m0n1o2p WIP: cleanup
```

After (restructured):
```
pick a1b2c3d WIP: start auth
squash e4f5g6h WIP: more auth stuff
squash i7j8k9l WIP: fix tests
squash m0n1o2p WIP: cleanup
```

Result: One clean commit with combined changes. Git will prompt you to reword the message.

## Splitting a Commit

When a commit contains multiple logical changes, split it during rebase:

### Step-by-Step

```bash
# 1. Start rebase, mark commit to split with 'edit'
git rebase -i main

# 2. When stopped at the commit, undo it but keep changes
git reset HEAD^

# 3. Now all changes are unstaged - stage first logical unit
git add -p  # Select only related hunks

# 4. Commit first unit
git commit -m "Add User model"

# 5. Stage and commit next unit
git add -p
git commit -m "Add auth middleware"

# 6. Continue until all changes committed
git add -p
git commit -m "Add login endpoint"

# 7. Continue the rebase
git rebase --continue
```

### Combining Commits

In the rebase editor, use `fixup` to absorb commits into the previous one:

```
pick a1b2c3d Add User model
fixup e4f5g6h Fix User model typo    # This gets absorbed
fixup i7j8k9l Add missing field      # This too
pick m0n1o2p Add auth middleware
```

## Safe History Rewriting

### The Golden Rule

**Only rewrite commits that haven't been shared.**

### Safe to Rewrite

- Local commits not yet pushed
- Your feature branch before PR creation
- After `git commit --amend` (if not pushed)

### Never Rewrite

- Anything on `main`
- Commits others have based work on
- After PR is merged
- Shared branches with collaborators

### Recovery from Mistakes

If rebase goes wrong:

```bash
# Abort current rebase (restores pre-rebase state)
git rebase --abort

# Or find previous state in reflog
git reflog
git reset --hard HEAD@{n}  # n = steps back to desired state
```

The reflog keeps everything for ~90 days. You can always recover.

### Resolving Divergent Branches After PR Merge

When local main diverges from origin/main after a PR merge (because local had unpushed commits that got squashed into the PR):

```bash
# Discard local unpushed commits and align with merged state
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

This discards the local WIP commits (now redundant since they were squashed into the PR) and aligns with the merged state.

### Recovery When npm install Breaks Types

When vitest types break (e.g., ".not does not exist on Assertion<T>"), the issue is often a package-lock.json mismatch:

```bash
# Restore known-good dependency resolution from main
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
git checkout main -- package-lock.json
npm install
```

This restores the dependency resolution that was working on main.

## Working Loop

### During Development (Phase 1)

1. **Learn the current state**: Run `git status` and `git diff HEAD` to see all changes.
2. **Work in checkpoints**: Commit frequently with "WIP:" prefix.
3. **Focus on making it work**: Don't worry about perfect commits yet.

### Before PR (Phase 2)

1. **Restructure history**: `git rebase -i main` to create atomic commits.
2. **Stage intentionally**: Use `git add -p` to build clean commits.
3. **Write meaningful messages**: Each commit explains why, not just what.
4. **Verify**: Run `./verify.sh --agent` on final state.
5. **Review your work**: `git log --oneline main..HEAD` should tell a clear story.

## Stage with Intent

- Use `git add -p` / `git add --patch` to select only the hunks that belong in the current commit.
- If you over-stage, recover with `git restore --staged <file>` or `git reset -p` to push lines back to unstaged.
- For mixed concerns in one file, stage one idea, commit, then stage the next. Do not let unrelated changes hitch a ride.
- Before committing, read the staged diff (`git diff --cached`) as if reviewing someone else's patch.

## Craft Messages That Speak

Structure your commit message with:
- **Subject line**: Imperative, ≤ 72 characters, states the action (e.g., "Add sandbox smoke guardrails").
- **Body** (when needed):
  - **Why**: The problem or goal.
  - **How**: Key decisions or noteworthy implementation notes.
  - **Tests**: Commands run or "Tests: not run (<reason>)".
  - **Follow-ups**: Known gaps, TODOs, or links to related issues.

### Example Commit Message

```
Add sandbox smoke guardrails

Why: prevent accidental writes during drills.
How: block non-sandbox ARNs and log rejections via audit port.
Tests: npm test -- workspace=core-domain
Follow-ups: wire audit log into CLI output.
```

## Keep History Healthy

- **Avoid destructive commands**: Use `git revert <sha>` over rewriting shared history.
- **Amend carefully**: Only amend before sharing and only when allowed by project rules; otherwise make a new commit that corrects the previous one.
- **Experiment safely**: Use throwaway branches and clean commits when you return to the main line.
- **Split changes after the fact**: Use `git reset -p` to unstage chunks, then restage and commit them separately.

## Investigate Before Reverting

**Never undo changes you don't understand.** Unexpected changes in `git status` deserve investigation, not reflexive reverting.

### The Anti-Pattern

```bash
# WRONG - Haphazard revert without investigation
git status
# Shows: modified: packages/some-package/src/index.ts
# Thought: "I don't remember changing that, revert it"
git checkout -- packages/some-package/src/index.ts  # DANGEROUS
```

### Why This Is Dangerous

Unexpected changes may come from:
- **Another agent** working on a related task in the same session
- **Pre-commit hooks** that auto-format or fix code
- **Build tools** that generate or modify files
- **A task you forgot about** earlier in the session
- **Intentional work** that hasn't been committed yet

Blindly reverting can:
- Destroy hours of work from parallel processes
- Break functionality that was just added
- Create confusing state where "something worked, now it doesn't"

### The Right Pattern

```bash
# RIGHT - Investigate first
git status
# Shows: modified: packages/some-package/src/index.ts

# Step 1: What changed?
git diff packages/some-package/src/index.ts

# Step 2: Does this change make sense given recent context?
# - Is this related to the current task?
# - Could another agent have made this?
# - Does this look like generated/auto-formatted code?

# Step 3: Only revert if you UNDERSTAND the change AND it's wrong
# If unsure: ASK THE USER before reverting
```

### Decision Tree

```
Unexpected change in git status
    │
    ├─► Is this file related to current/recent work?
    │       │
    │       ├─► YES → Likely intentional, investigate the diff
    │       │
    │       └─► NO → Could be parallel work, ASK before reverting
    │
    └─► Does the diff look intentional (new features, fixes)?
            │
            ├─► YES → DO NOT REVERT - commit or preserve it
            │
            └─► NO (looks like accidental/broken change) → Safe to revert
```

### Rule of Thumb

**When in doubt, preserve the change.** It's easier to revert later than to recover lost work. If you're unsure whether a change should exist, ask the user rather than making assumptions.

## Parallel Work on Shared Branches

When working on a branch where parallel work may occur (human or other agents), **never discard uncommitted changes**. See [Cardinal Rules](#cardinal-rules-protect-others-work) above.

### Switching Branches Safely

If you need to switch branches:

```bash
# WRONG - loses parallel work
git stash && git checkout main

# RIGHT - preserves everything
git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: checkpoint before context switch"
git checkout -b new-task
```

### Safe Patterns

1. **Leave unrecognized changes alone**: If it's not blocking you, ignore it
2. **Commit before switching**: `git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: checkpoint"`
3. **New branch preserves state**: `git checkout -b my-new-work` keeps everything
4. **Ask before any destructive action**: Never discard without explicit user approval

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| See what changed | `git status`, `git diff`, `git diff --cached`, `git show HEAD` |
| Stage carefully | `git add -p`, `git restore --staged <path>`, `git reset -p` |
| Review history | `git log --oneline -n 5`, `git show <sha>` |
| Review branch history | `git log --oneline main..HEAD` |
| Undo safely | `git revert <sha>` (preferred), `git restore <path>` for workspace edits |
| Restructure history | `git rebase -i main` |
| Split a commit | `git rebase -i` → edit → `git reset HEAD^` → stage/commit parts |
| Combine commits | `git rebase -i` → squash/fixup |
| Abort rebase | `git rebase --abort` |
| Find lost commits | `git reflog` |

## Sandbox-Safe Commits

When running in a sandboxed environment, heredocs (`<<EOF`) fail because they create temp files in `/tmp`, which is blocked. Use these patterns instead.

### Problem: Heredocs Fail in Sandbox

```bash
# FAILS - heredoc needs /tmp write access
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: add feature

Body text here
EOF
)"
# Error: can't create temp file for here document: operation not permitted
```

### Solution 1: Multiple -m Flags (Recommended)

Each `-m` flag adds a paragraph to the commit message:

```bash
# Simple commit
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"

# With body (empty -m creates blank line)
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication" \
  -m "" \
  -m "Why: users need secure login" \
  -m "How: JWT tokens with refresh rotation"

# With trailer
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication" \
  -m "" \
  -m "Implements secure JWT-based auth flow" \
  -m "" \
  -m "🤖 Generated with Claude Code" \
  -m "" \
  -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Solution 2: Temp File in Allowed Directory

Write the message to `/tmp/claude/` which is sandbox-allowed:

```bash
# Write multi-line message to allowed temp location
cat > /tmp/claude/commit-msg.txt << 'COMMIT'
feat: add user authentication

Why: users need secure login
How: JWT tokens with refresh rotation

🤖 Generated with Claude Code
COMMIT

# Commit using the file
git commit -F /tmp/claude/commit-msg.txt

# Clean up
rm /tmp/claude/commit-msg.txt
```

**Note**: The outer heredoc writing to `/tmp/claude/` succeeds because that path is in the sandbox allowlist.

### Quick Reference

| Pattern | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| Single `-m "msg"` | Simple one-line commits |
| Multiple `-m` flags | Multi-paragraph messages |
| `-F /tmp/claude/file` | Complex messages with special characters |
