# anysite Competitor Intelligence

Comprehensive competitive intelligence gathering using anysite MCP server. Track competitors across LinkedIn, social media, and the web to understand their strategies, monitor their activities, and identify competitive opportunities.

## Overview

The anysite Competitor Intelligence skill helps you:
- **Track competitor companies** on LinkedIn and Y Combinator
- **Monitor hiring patterns** to identify growth areas and strategic priorities
- **Analyze content strategies** across social platforms
- **Benchmark positioning** and messaging
- **Identify key employees** and leadership changes
- **Track competitive movements** like funding, launches, partnerships

This skill provides 90% coverage of competitive intelligence capabilities with excellent LinkedIn and social media monitoring.

## v2 Tool Interface

All data fetching uses the universal `execute()` meta-tool:

```
execute(source, category, endpoint, params) → returns data + cache_key
```

After fetching, use these for analysis and export:
- `get_page(cache_key, offset, limit)` — paginate through large result sets
- `query_cache(cache_key, conditions, sort_by, aggregate, group_by)` — filter/sort/aggregate cached data without re-fetching
- `export_data(cache_key, format)` — export to CSV, JSON, or JSONL for sharing

Always call `discover(source, category)` first if unsure about endpoint names or params.

**Error handling**: Check response for `llm_hint` field on errors — it provides actionable guidance (e.g., "Likely passed fsd_company URN instead of company: prefix").

## Supported Platforms

- **LinkedIn** (Primary): Company pages, employee search, post monitoring, job listings, growth tracking
- **Y Combinator**: Startup competitor research, funding data, batch analysis
- **Twitter/X**: Social presence monitoring, content strategy, engagement analysis
- **Reddit**: Community sentiment, product discussions, competitor mentions
- **Instagram**: Brand presence, visual content strategy, influencer partnerships
- **YouTube**: Video content, channel growth, community engagement
- **Web Scraping**: Company websites, press releases, blog content
- **SEC**: Public company filings for competitors

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Identify Competitors

Choose your competitor identification method:

| Goal | v2 Call | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| Find similar companies | `execute("linkedin", "search", "search_companies", {"keywords": "...", "count": 50})` | Company list with metrics |
| Research startup competitors | `execute("yc", "search", "search_companies", {"query": "...", "count": 50})` | YC startups by industry/batch |
| Discover by employee search | `execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {...})` → extract companies | Companies from employee profiles |
| Find by keywords/industry | `execute("linkedin", "search", "search_companies", {"keywords": "...", "industry": "...", "count": 50})` | Filtered company list |

### Step 2: Gather Competitive Intelligence

Execute MCP tools to collect competitor data:

**Company Profile Analysis**
```
execute("linkedin", "company", "company", {"company": "competitor-name"})
→ Returns: Description, size, location, website, specialties, URN
```

**Employee Intelligence**
```
execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {
  "company_keywords": "Competitor Inc",
  "title": "VP OR Director OR Head",
  "count": 50
})
→ Returns: Key employees, org structure insights
→ Use get_page(cache_key, 10, 50) to load more results
```

**Hiring Velocity Analysis**
```
execute("linkedin", "company", "company_employee_stats", {
  "urn": {"type": "company", "value": "<company_id>"}
})
→ Returns: Growth metrics, department distribution
→ Use query_cache(cache_key, sort_by=[{"field": "count", "order": "desc"}]) to rank departments
```

**Content Strategy**
```
execute("linkedin", "company", "company_posts", {
  "urn": {"type": "company", "value": "<company_id>"},
  "count": 20
})
→ Returns: Recent posts, engagement, messaging themes
→ Use query_cache(cache_key, aggregate=[{"field": "reactions", "function": "avg"}]) for engagement stats
```

### Step 3: Process and Analyze

Analyze gathered data for:
- **Growth signals**: Hiring velocity, funding, expansion
- **Strategic priorities**: Department hiring, job postings, content themes
- **Market positioning**: Messaging, target audience, value props
- **Competitive threats**: New products, partnerships, key hires

Use `query_cache()` to filter and aggregate without re-fetching:
```
query_cache(cache_key, conditions=[{"field": "department", "operator": "contains", "value": "Engineering"}])
```

### Step 4: Format Output

**Chat Summary**: Competitive insights with key findings
**CSV Export**: `export_data(cache_key, "csv")` → Competitor comparison matrix
**JSON Export**: `export_data(cache_key, "json")` → Complete data for tracking over time

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Competitor Not Found on LinkedIn

**Solution**:
- Try company name variations
- Search for employees and extract company
- Check if using DBA vs. legal name
- Try website domain search
- Error `412` means not found — check the `llm_hint` in the response for guidance

### Issue: Limited Employee Data

**Solution**:
- Employees may have privacy settings
- Try searching by title without company filter
- Focus on public leadership team
- Use website team pages as alternative

### Issue: No Recent Company Posts

**Solution**:
- Company may not be active on LinkedIn
- Check Twitter/Instagram instead
- Use website blog for content analysis
- Focus on employee posts mentioning company

### Issue: URN Format Errors (422)

**Solution**:
- Company sub-endpoints require `company:` prefix, NOT `fsd_company`
- Convert: `urn:li:fsd_company:1441` → use `{"type": "company", "value": "1441"}`
- User sub-endpoints require `fsd_profile` URN from `/linkedin/user` response
- Always get URNs from the parent endpoint response first
