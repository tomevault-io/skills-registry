# anysite Lead Generation

Professional lead generation and prospecting using the anysite MCP server. Find prospects on LinkedIn, discover verified emails, extract contacts from websites, and build comprehensive lead lists for sales, recruiting, and business development.

## Overview

The anysite Lead Generation skill helps you:
- **Find qualified prospects** on LinkedIn using advanced search filters
- **Enrich profiles** with work history, education, and skills
- **Discover email addresses** through LinkedIn email finding
- **Extract contact information** from company websites

This skill provides comprehensive lead generation capabilities with the added benefit of zero configuration and immediate execution through anysite MCP.

## Supported Platforms

- **LinkedIn** (Primary): People search, profile enrichment, email discovery, company research, employee listings
- **Web Scraping**: Contact extraction from websites, sitemap parsing, general web data
- **Instagram**: Business account discovery and profile analysis (supplementary)
- **Y Combinator**: Startup company and founder research (supplementary)

## v2 API Overview

All data fetching uses the universal `execute()` tool with four parameters: `source`, `category`, `endpoint`, `params`. Supporting tools:

- **`execute(source, category, endpoint, params)`** - Fetch data. Returns first page of items + `cache_key`.
- **`get_page(cache_key, offset, limit)`** - Load additional pages from a previous execute() result using the returned `cache_key` and `next_offset`.
- **`query_cache(cache_key, conditions, sort_by, aggregate, group_by)`** - Filter, sort, count, or aggregate already-fetched data without a new API call.
- **`export_data(cache_key, format)`** - Export a full dataset as CSV, JSON, or JSONL. Returns a download URL.
- **`discover(source, category)`** - Inspect available endpoints and their accepted params (use when unsure about params).

### Error Handling

v2 responses may include an `llm_hint` field with human-readable guidance when something goes wrong (e.g., invalid params, rate limits). Always check for `llm_hint` in the response and follow its advice before retrying.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Identify Your Lead Source

Choose the appropriate data source based on your prospecting goal:

| Goal | v2 Call | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| Find prospects by title/company | `execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {...})` | B2B prospecting, targeted outreach |
| Enrich existing leads | `execute("linkedin", "user", "get", {"user": ...})` | Add work history, education, skills |
| Find verified emails | `execute("linkedin", "email", "find", {"user": ...})` | Email outreach campaigns |
| Extract website contacts | `execute("webparser", "parse", "parse", {"url": ...})` | Get emails/phones from contact pages |
| Research target companies | `execute("linkedin", "search", "search_companies", {...})` | Account-based marketing (ABM) |
| Find company employees | `execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {...})` + company filter | Multi-threading into accounts |

### Step 2: Execute Data Collection

Use anysite MCP v2 tools directly to gather lead data:

**Example: Find Sales VPs in San Francisco**
```
Tool: mcp__anysite__execute
Parameters:
- source: "linkedin"
- category: "search"
- endpoint: "search_users"
- params: {"title": "VP Sales", "location": "San Francisco Bay Area", "count": 25}
```

**Example: Enrich a LinkedIn Profile**
```
Tool: mcp__anysite__execute
Parameters:
- source: "linkedin"
- category: "user"
- endpoint: "get"
- params: {"user": "linkedin.com/in/johndoe", "with_experience": true, "with_education": true, "with_skills": true}
```

**Example: Find Email Address**
```
Tool: mcp__anysite__execute
Parameters:
- source: "linkedin"
- category: "email"
- endpoint: "find"
- params: {"user": "johndoe"}
```

**Example: Extract Contacts from Website**
```
Tool: mcp__anysite__execute
Parameters:
- source: "webparser"
- category: "parse"
- endpoint: "parse"
- params: {"url": "https://company.com/contact", "extract_contacts": true, "strip_all_tags": true}
```

### Step 3: Process and Analyze Results

After execute() returns data with a `cache_key`, use v2 post-processing:

- **Filter results**: `query_cache(cache_key, conditions=[{"field": "title", "operator": "contains", "value": "VP"}])`
- **Sort results**: `query_cache(cache_key, sort_by=[{"field": "follower_count", "order": "desc"}])`
- **Count results**: `query_cache(cache_key, aggregate=[{"function": "count", "field": "*"}])`
- **Get more pages**: `get_page(cache_key, offset=next_offset, limit=10)`

Also review the returned data for:
- **Profile completeness**: Work history, education, skills presence
- **Contact quality**: Email deliverability, phone format
- **Relevance scoring**: Title match, company fit, location alignment
- **Enrichment opportunities**: Missing data that can be filled

### Step 4: Format Output

Choose your preferred output format:

**Chat Summary (Default)**
- Displays top prospects with key details
- Includes actionable next steps
- Shows data quality metrics

**CSV Export (via v2 export_data)**
```
Tool: mcp__anysite__export_data
Parameters:
- cache_key: <cache_key from execute>
- format: "csv"
```
Returns a download URL. Ready for CRM import (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Platform Lead Enrichment

Combine LinkedIn data with other platforms for comprehensive lead profiles:

**Pattern**: LinkedIn -> Company Website -> Instagram (for B2C)

1. Find prospect on LinkedIn
2. Get company website from LinkedIn company profile
3. Extract additional contacts from website
4. Check Instagram for business account (B2C companies)
5. Analyze social presence and engagement

**Example**:
```
1. execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {"keywords": "Emily Chen", "company_keywords": "FashionBrand"})
2. execute("linkedin", "company", "get", {"company": "FashionBrand"}) -> Get website URL
3. execute("webparser", "parse", "parse", {"url": "<website>/contact", "extract_contacts": true}) -> Get phone, email
4. execute("instagram", "search", "search_users", {"query": "FashionBrand"}) -> Find official account
5. execute("instagram", "user", "user", {"user": "fashionbrand"}) -> Verify business account, get follower count
```

### Boolean Search Patterns

Advanced LinkedIn search using keyword combinations:

**Title Combinations**:
- `"VP Sales" OR "Head of Sales" OR "Director Sales"` - Multiple title variations
- `"Software Engineer" AND "Python"` - Title + required skill
- `"Marketing" NOT "Intern"` - Exclude junior levels

**Company Patterns**:
- `"Google OR Meta OR Amazon"` - Multiple target companies
- `"SaaS" AND "B2B"` - Industry qualifiers
- `"Startup OR Early Stage"` - Company stage targeting

**Location Strategies**:
- `"San Francisco Bay Area"` - Metropolitan areas
- `"United States"` - Country-level
- `"Remote"` - Remote-only positions

### Lead Scoring Framework

Score prospects based on multiple criteria:

**Scoring Dimensions**:
1. **Profile Completeness** (0-20 points)
   - Has email: +10
   - Complete work history: +5
   - Complete education: +3
   - Skills listed: +2

2. **Title Match** (0-30 points)
   - Exact match: +30
   - Similar title: +20
   - Related title: +10
   - Wrong level: +0

3. **Company Fit** (0-25 points)
   - Ideal company size: +25
   - Acceptable size: +15
   - Too small/large: +5

4. **Experience Level** (0-15 points)
   - 5-10 years: +15
   - 3-5 years: +10
   - 10+ years: +10
   - <3 years: +5

5. **Location** (0-10 points)
   - Target location: +10
   - Acceptable location: +5
   - Remote: +8

**Total Score**: 0-100 points
- **90-100**: Hot lead - Contact immediately
- **70-89**: Warm lead - High priority follow-up
- **50-69**: Qualified - Standard outreach
- **<50**: Unqualified - Nurture or discard

Use `query_cache()` to filter by score thresholds:
```
query_cache(cache_key, conditions=[{"field": "score", "operator": ">=", "value": 70}], sort_by=[{"field": "score", "order": "desc"}])
```

### Automated Prospect Enrichment

Systematic enrichment workflow for large lists:

**Process**:
1. **Initial Search**: Get 100-500 prospects from LinkedIn search via execute()
2. **Paginate**: Use get_page() to collect all results beyond the first page
3. **First Filter**: Use query_cache() to remove obviously unqualified (wrong title, location, etc.)
4. **Batch Enrichment**: Enrich top 50 prospects with full profiles via execute()
5. **Email Discovery**: Find emails for top 25 prospects via execute()
6. **Web Research**: Extract company contacts for remaining prospects
7. **Final Scoring**: Apply lead scoring framework
8. **Export**: Use export_data(cache_key, "csv") for top-scored leads

**Efficiency Tips**:
- Start with larger searches (100+) to account for filtering
- Enrich in batches of 10-20 to avoid overwhelming results
- Prioritize email finding for highest-scored prospects first
- Use web scraping as backup when LinkedIn emails unavailable

## Limitations and Alternatives

### Platform Gaps

This skill focuses on B2B lead generation where LinkedIn, web scraping, and professional networks provide the most comprehensive data. For local business discovery and contact extraction, the combination of LinkedIn company search and web scraping provides strong coverage.

**Note on Crunchbase**: Crunchbase tools are disabled in v2. Use LinkedIn company search and Y Combinator data as alternatives for company research and funding information.

### Rate Limits and Timeouts

**Default Timeout**: 300 seconds (5 minutes) per MCP tool call

**Strategies for Large Datasets**:
1. **Batch Processing**: Use `count` parameter to limit results per call
   - Search 25-50 prospects at a time
   - Make multiple calls for larger lists
   - Allow processing time between batches

2. **Pagination**: Use `get_page(cache_key, offset, limit)` to retrieve additional results without re-executing the search.

3. **Parallel Processing**: For independent queries
   - Search multiple locations simultaneously
   - Enrich different prospect segments in parallel
   - Extract contacts from multiple websites at once

**Example**:
```
Instead of:
execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {"count": 200}) -> May timeout

Do this:
execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {"count": 50, "location": "California"})
execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {"count": 50, "location": "New York"})
execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {"count": 50, "location": "Texas"})
execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {"count": 50, "location": "Florida"})
```

### Data Freshness

**LinkedIn Data**: Real-time access through anysite MCP
- Results cached for 7 days via cache_key (use get_page/query_cache without re-fetching)
- Profile updates reflected in new execute() calls
- Company changes visible in real-time

**Recommendation**:
1. Use `execute("linkedin", "email", "find", {"user": ...})` for email discovery
2. Validate emails before sending (use email validation service)
3. Update your CRM when emails bounce

### Privacy and Compliance

**LinkedIn Terms of Service**:
- Respect LinkedIn's usage policies
- Don't automate excessive requests
- Comply with user privacy settings
- Follow GDPR/CCPA requirements

**Email Collection**:
- Only collect publicly available emails
- Provide opt-out mechanisms
- Comply with anti-spam laws (CAN-SPAM, GDPR)
- Maintain suppression lists

**Best Practices**:
- Use data for legitimate business purposes only
- Respect connection request limits
- Don't scrape private profile information
- Maintain data security for collected leads

- Overly restrictive search criteria
- Incorrect location format
- Title keywords too specific
- Company name misspelled

**Solutions**:
- Broaden search criteria (remove some filters)
- Try location variations: "San Francisco", "San Francisco Bay Area", "SF"
- Use partial titles: "Sales" instead of "Vice President of Sales"
- Verify company names with `execute("linkedin", "search", "search_companies", {...})` first
- Check `llm_hint` in the response for guidance

**Example Fix**:
```
Too Restrictive:
execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {"title": "Vice President of Enterprise Sales", "location": "San Francisco, California", "company_keywords": "Salesforce Inc"})

Better:
execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {"title": "VP Sales OR Head of Sales", "location": "San Francisco Bay Area", "company_keywords": "Salesforce"})
```

#### 2. Email Not Found

**Symptoms**: Email find returns no results

**Causes**:
- Email not in database
- User privacy settings
- Email verification required

**Solutions**:
1. Extract email from company website instead
2. Use email pattern guessing (firstname.lastname@company.com)
3. Check for email in LinkedIn profile "Contact Info" section

**Alternative Workflow**:
```
1. execute("linkedin", "user", "get", {"user": "<username>"}) -> Get current company
2. execute("linkedin", "company", "get", {"company": "<company>"}) -> Get company website
3. execute("webparser", "parse", "parse", {"url": "<website>/contact", "extract_contacts": true}) -> Extract company emails
4. Use email pattern: first.last@companydomain.com
```

#### 3. Timeout Errors

**Symptoms**: Request times out after 300 seconds

**Causes**:
- Large result count requested
- Complex search criteria
- Server load issues

**Solutions**:
- Reduce `count` parameter (try 25-50 instead of 100+)
- Break large searches into multiple smaller searches
- Simplify search criteria
- Check `llm_hint` for retry guidance

**Example**:
```
May Timeout:
execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {"title": "Software Engineer", "count": 500})

Better:
execute("linkedin", "search", "search_users", {"title": "Software Engineer", "count": 50})
# Then use get_page(cache_key, next_offset, 50) for additional results
```

#### 4. Incomplete Profile Data

**Symptoms**: Profile missing work history, education, or skills

**Causes**:
- User profile not complete on LinkedIn
- Privacy settings limit data access
- Profile hasn't been updated

**Solutions**:
- Set `with_experience`, `with_education`, `with_skills` to true in params
- Accept incomplete data and supplement with web research
- Focus on prospects with complete profiles

#### 5. Invalid User URN

**Symptoms**: Error when using URN in follow-up calls

**Causes**:
- Incorrect URN format
- URN from different data source
- Stale URN reference

**Solutions**:
- Use LinkedIn username instead of URN when possible
- Verify URN format: `urn:li:fsd_profile:XXXXXXXXX`
- Get fresh URN from recent search
- Use profile URL as alternative identifier
