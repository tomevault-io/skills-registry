# Universal Deep Search

Comprehensive intelligence gathering across ALL available data sources with cascading analysis.

## Core Principle: CASCADING SEARCH

Every search expands to related entities:
- **PERSON** → + their company + key colleagues + company news
- **COMPANY** → + founders + C-level team + investors + competitors mentions
- **TOPIC** → + key people mentioned + companies involved + YC startups in space

## Query Classification

### Type 1: PERSON
**Triggers:** Names, roles ("CEO of"), profile URLs, "who is", "find person"

**Context to extract:**
- Full name (required)
- Company (helpful)
- Role/title (helpful)
- Location (helpful)

### Type 2: COMPANY
**Triggers:** Company names, domains (.io, .com), "startup", "company", linkedin.com/company/

**Context to extract:**
- Company name (required)
- Domain (helpful)
- Industry (helpful)
- Location (helpful)

### Type 3: TOPIC
**Triggers:** Abstract concepts, questions, hashtags, "news about", "trends in"

**Context to extract:**
- Keywords (required)
- Time frame (helpful)
- Industry/niche (helpful)
