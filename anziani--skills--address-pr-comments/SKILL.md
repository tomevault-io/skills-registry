# Address PR Comments Skill

**Trigger:** User provides a **pull request URL** and requests to address PR comments.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch PR Comments

Run the script to fetch active (unresolved) PR comments:

- If you are _Roo_ based agent, run:
  ```powershell
  pwsh -Command "$scriptPath = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE '.roo\skills\address-pr-comments\scripts\Get-PullRequestComments.ps1'; & $scriptPath -PullRequestUrl '<url>'"
  ```

- If you are _GitHub Copilot_ based agent, run:
  ```powershell
  pwsh -Command "$scriptPath = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE '.copilot\skills\address-pr-comments\scripts\Get-PullRequestComments.ps1'; & $scriptPath -PullRequestUrl '<url>'"
  ```

The script returns a JSON object with PR metadata and a `Comments` array. Each comment contains:
- `ThreadId` - Unique thread identifier
- `CommentId` - Comment identifier
- `Author` - Who posted the comment
- `Content` - Full comment text
- `Summary` - One-sentence summary (first 100 chars)
- `ReplyCount` - Number of replies
- `FilePath` - File the comment is on (if applicable)
- `LineNumber` - Line number (if applicable)
- `Url` - Direct link to the comment thread

### Step 2: Display Comments Summary

Present comments to user in a table format:

| # | Summary | Author | Replies | Link |
|---|---------|--------|---------|------|
| 1 | Fix null check in... | John Doe | 2 | [View](url) |
| 2 | Consider using... | Jane Smith | 0 | [View](url) |

### Step 3: Ask User Which Comments to Address

Use `ask_followup_question` with options:
- "Address all comments"
- "Address comment #1"
- "Address comment #2" (etc., up to 4 options total)
- If more than 3 comments, include "Let me specify which comments to address"

### Step 4: Create PR Comments Analysis File

Create a markdown file at `.ai/pr-comments/pr-<pr-number>-comments.md` with:

```markdown
# PR #<number> - Comment Analysis

**PR Title:** <title>
**Author:** <author>
**Date:** <current date>

## Comments to Address

### Comment #1: <summary>
**Author:** <author>
**File:** <file path>:<line number>
**Link:** [View Comment](<url>)

**Full Comment:**
> <full comment text>

**Replies:**
> - <reply 1>
> - <reply 2>

**Proposed Resolution:**
<AI analysis and proposed fix>

---
(repeat for each selected comment)
```

### Step 5: Confirm Before Making Changes

Use `ask_followup_question` to confirm:
- "Yes, proceed with the proposed changes"
- "No, I want to modify the approach"
- "Show me the proposed changes first"
- "Cancel - I'll address these manually"

### Step 6: Apply Changes

Only after user confirmation:
1. Make the necessary code changes to address each comment
2. Update the markdown file with the changes made
3. Summarize what was done

## Script Requirements

The [`Get-PullRequestComments.ps1`](scripts/Get-PullRequestComments.ps1) script:
- Acquires an Azure AD token via `az account get-access-token` for the Azure DevOps resource
- Calls Azure DevOps REST API using `Invoke-RestMethod` with Bearer token authentication
- Filters to active (unresolved) threads only
- Returns structured JSON with PR metadata (`PullRequestId`, `Title`, `Author`, `SourceBranch`, `TargetBranch`) and a `Comments` array

## Output Files

- **Analysis file:** `.ai/pr-comments/pr-<pr-number>-comments.md`
- Create the `.ai/pr-comments/` directory if it doesn't exist

## Error Handling

- If no active comments found, inform user: "No active (unresolved) comments found on this PR."
- If Azure CLI not authenticated, provide guidance: "Run `az login` to authenticate."
- If PR URL is invalid, show expected format.
- If token acquisition fails, the script throws with a clear message to run `az login`.

## References

- Requires Azure CLI (`az`) for token acquisition only
- Uses Azure DevOps REST API: `GET _apis/git/repositories/{repo}/pullrequests/{id}/threads?api-version=7.1`
