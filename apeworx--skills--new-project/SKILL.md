# Overview

Guide users through architecting Python-based blockchain projects using the Ape framework.
This skill helps establish proper project structure, configuration, and architectural patterns before implementation begins.

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, verify the user has:

- `uv` installed (https://docs.astral.sh/uv)
- Basic understanding of Python and blockchain concepts
- Clear project goals (even if high-level)
  - Use the `development/spec-interview` skill if project is not fully specified
- Familiarity with Ape documentation: https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/quickstart

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Project Type

Ask focused questions to understand what the user wants to build:

**Essential questions:**

- What problem are you solving or what functionality do you need?
- Will this interact with existing protocols or create something new?
- Does this need to monitor blockchain events or execute transactions?
- Is this for a specific protocol, a general tool, or a new application?

Based on responses, categorize the project as one of:

1. **Protocol SDK** - Python library for interacting with an existing protocol (e.g. Uniswap)
2. **Ape Plugin** - Extension adding functionality to the Ape framework (e.g. Trezor hardware wallet)
3. **Blockchain Bot** - Automated system responding to on-chain events (e.g. Trading bot)
4. **Protocol Development** - A completely new smart contract protocol (including scripts and tests)
5. **Blockchain Application** - A complex application integrating with one (or more) blockchain(s)

### Step 2: Gather Project-Specific Context

Based on project type, ask targeted follow-up questions.
Keep questions focused and avoid overwhelming the user.

**For Protocol SDKs:**

- Which protocol/contracts will this SDK interact with?
- What are the main operations users will perform with the SDK?
- Do you have a link to the source code and/or documentation for the protocol?
- Reference the `protocols/writing-sdks` skill for more detailed workflow

**For Ape Plugins:**

- What functionality will this add to Ape? (Plugin vertical e.g. AccountAPI, CompilerAPI, ProviderAPI, etc.)
- Does this integrate with a command-line tool (installed locally) or an external service (requiring an API key)?
- Does it need it's own command-line interface integrated with ape? (e.g. `ape [plugin-name] ...`)
- Reference the `ape/writing-plugins` skill for more detailed workflow

**For Blockchain Bots:**

- Which events should trigger actions?
- What actions should the bot perform, in response to those triggers?
- Does it need to sign and submit messages or transactions?
- Reference the `silverback/writing-bots` skill for detailed bot architecture

**For Protocol Development:**

- Which smart contract language do you want to use? (Solidity, Vyper)
- What does the protocol do?
- Do you need multi-chain deployment support?
- Reference the `ape/protocol-design` skill for more detailed workflow

**For Blockchain Applications:**

- What existing protocol(s) does this application need to integrate with?
- What blockchain operations are needed? (submitting transactions, listening to events)
- What's the deployment strategy? How does it need to be hosted?
- Reference the `apps/system-design` skill for more detailed workflow

### Step 3: Generate Project Architecture

Create the appropriate project structure based on chosen project type.

**Common elements across all projects:**

1. Verify project structure is complete
2. Ensure `pyproject.toml` has required dependencies
3. Ensure README.md includes setup instructions
4. Install project locally with `uv sync`

### Step 4: Provide Context and Next Steps

After generating the architecture and installing the project:

1. **Explain the structure** - Briefly describe key files and their purposes
2. **Identify knowledge gaps** - Note where additional skills or documentation are needed:
3. **Recommend next steps** - Clear guidance on what to implement first

### Step 5: Iterate and Refine

After user reviews the architecture:

- Answer questions about design decisions
- Adjust structure based on feedback
- Add missing configurations or files
- Provide additional references as needed

## Key Principles

**Stay high-level**: Focus on correct architecture, not implementation details
**Fetch documentation**: Always get current Ape/Silverback docs before proceeding
**Reference other skills**: Point to specialized skills for detailed workflows
**Adapt to skill level**: Adjust explanations based on user's Python/blockchain experience
**Validate understanding**: Confirm project requirements before generating structure

## Common Pitfalls

- Don't start coding implementation before architecture is confirmed
- Don't assume package versions - check current stable releases
- Don't create overly complex structures for simple projects
- Don't skip documentation fetching - APIs and best practices change
- Don't forget to specify where additional skills/docs are needed
