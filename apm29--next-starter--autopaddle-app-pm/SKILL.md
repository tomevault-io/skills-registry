# AutoPaddle Application Product Manager

Gather, analyze, and clarify requirements for AutoPaddle Next.js applications before implementation.

## Role & Responsibilities

As the AutoPaddle Application Product Manager, this skill:

- 📋 **Requirement Analysis** - Understand user needs and translate them into technical specifications
- 🎯 **Scope Definition** - Define clear application boundaries and deliverables
- 📊 **Data Source Planning** - Identify required APIs and data sources (within platform constraints)
- 🎨 **UX Requirements** - Specify user experience expectations and constraints
- ✅ **Feature Checklist** - Create actionable feature lists for developers
- 🔌 **API Constraint Awareness** - Ensure requirements align with available AutoPaddle APIs and InfluxDB capabilities

## When to Use This Skill

**MANDATORY for autopaddle-nextjs-builder:**
- Before any AutoPaddle app implementation begins
- When user requirements are vague or incomplete
- When planning new features or pages

**Optional standalone use:**
- Planning AutoPaddle application architecture
- Evaluating feasibility of feature requests
- Creating technical specifications for stakeholders

## Platform Technical Constraints 🔌

**CRITICAL**: As a PM, you MUST understand and work within AutoPaddle platform's technical capabilities. All requirements must align with available APIs and data sources.

### AutoPaddle Cloud API Constraints

**Authentication Requirements:**
- All API calls MUST include headers:
  - `Authorization: Bearer ${accessToken}`
  - `Tenant-ID: ${tenantId}`
- Handle 401 responses by refreshing tokens automatically
- Response format: `{code: 0, data: {...}, msg: ""}`

**Available API Categories:**
- Device Management APIs (device list, device info, device pins)
- Device Daily Report APIs (device daily production info)
- Alarm System APIs (alarm records, alarm statistics)
- Business Data APIs (custom business metrics)
- User Management APIs (user info, permissions)

**PM Consideration**:
- Verify required APIs exist in `skill:autopaddle-api-explorer` before committing to features
- Plan for token refresh logic in all data-fetching scenarios
- Design error handling for API failures

### InfluxDB Time-Series Data Constraints

**Query Constraints:**
- Time-series data only (device pins, sensor readings, metrics over time)
- Requires Flux query language knowledge
- Session-based query pattern for complex queries:
  1. Initiate query with sessionId
  2. Poll for results using sessionId
  3. Parse returned data

**PM Consideration**:
- Historical data queries are suitable for trends, charts, and analytics
- Real-time data requires polling or WebSocket implementation
- Complex aggregations may need session-based queries
- Verify measurement and field names exist before planning features

### Data Query Patterns

**Session-Based Query Workflow:**
1. **Initiate**: POST request with query parameters, receive sessionId
2. **Poll**: GET request with sessionId to check status
3. **Retrieve**: Parse data when status is "completed"

**PM Consideration**:
- Plan for loading states during query execution
- Design UX for long-running queries (progress indicators)
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data

### Technical Feasibility Checklist

Before finalizing requirements, verify:

- [ ] All required APIs are documented in `references/api-reference.md`
- [ ] InfluxDB measurements/fields are available (check `references/influxdb-guide.md`)
- [ ] Data query patterns are supported (check `references/data-query-patterns.md`)
- [ ] Authentication flow is understood (token refresh, error handling)
- [ ] Time-series data requirements align with InfluxDB capabilities
- [ ] Real-time update requirements are achievable (polling intervals, WebSocket support)

### Common Technical Limitations

**What AutoPaddle Platform CAN do:**
✅ Fetch device lists and device information
✅ Query historical time-series data (device pins, sensors)
✅ Retrieve alarm records with pagination
✅ Access business data metrics
✅ Authenticate with tenant-specific tokens

**What AutoPaddle Platform CANNOT do (without custom implementation):**
❌ Direct database writes (read-only access)
❌ Real-time push notifications (requires polling or WebSocket setup)
❌ Cross-tenant data access (tenant isolation enforced)
❌ Arbitrary SQL queries (InfluxDB uses Flux query language)
❌ File uploads/downloads (unless API specifically supports it)

**PM Responsibility**:
- Clarify technical feasibility BEFORE committing to features
- Propose alternative solutions if requested feature exceeds platform capabilities
- Document technical constraints in requirement specification

## Requirement Gathering Process

### Step 1: Understand User Intent

Ask clarifying questions about:

1. **Application Type**
   - Dashboard? Monitoring tool? Reporting system? Configuration interface?
   - Who are the end users? (Operators, managers, technicians, etc.)
   - What problem does this solve?

2. **Core Functionality**
   - What are the main tasks users need to accomplish?
   - What decisions will users make with this data?
   - Are there any critical workflows to support?

3. **Data Requirements**
   - What devices/equipment need to be monitored?
   - What metrics or KPIs are important?
   - Historical data or real-time only?
   - Any specific time ranges or aggregations?
   - **Verify against platform constraints**: Check if required data is available via AutoPaddle APIs or InfluxDB

### Step 2: Define Application Scope

Create a structured specification including:

**Application Overview:**
- Application name and purpose
- Target users and use cases
- Success criteria

**Page Structure:**
- List of pages/routes needed
- Purpose of each page
- Navigation flow between pages

**Data Sources:**
- AutoPaddle Cloud APIs needed (devices, alarms, business data, etc.)
  - **Verify**: Check `references/api-reference.md` for API availability
  - **Note**: All APIs require `Authorization` and `Tenant-ID` headers
- InfluxDB measurements and fields required
  - **Verify**: Check `references/influxdb-guide.md` for measurement/field availability
  - **Note**: Connection to `http://${GATEWAY_IP}:18086` with org `autopaddle`
- Any external data sources
  - **Constraint**: May require custom implementation if not in platform

**Feature Requirements:**
- Core features (must-have)
- Secondary features (nice-to-have)
- Future considerations (out of scope for now)

### Step 3: Specify UX Requirements

Define user experience expectations:

**Data Presentation:**
- Tables, charts, cards, or other visualizations?
- Filtering and search capabilities
- Sorting and pagination needs

**Interaction Patterns:**
- Real-time updates vs. manual refresh
- Drill-down or detail views
- Export or reporting capabilities

**UX Best Practices:**
- Use dropdowns instead of raw ID inputs
- Display names instead of IDs (with proper mapping)
- Format timestamps with dayjs or similar
- Show loading states and error messages
- Provide data completeness in dropdowns

### Step 4: Create Deliverable Document

Generate a structured requirement document:

```markdown

❌ **Missing data sources** - "Show device data"
✅ **Specific data sources** - "GET /device/device/list for device info, InfluxDB device_pins measurement for pin values"

❌ **Unclear scope** - "Add some charts"
✅ **Clear scope** - "Line chart for temperature trend (last 24h), bar chart for alarm count by severity"

❌ **No prioritization** - "Need all these features"
✅ **Prioritized features** - "Core: device list, temperature display; Secondary: export, notifications"
