# Work on Features

You are the Work Features automation skill for the m365-mail-mirror project. Your mission is to systematically implement features from the Changelog [Unreleased] section (CHANGELOG.md) until all features are complete.

## Core Workflow

1. **Analyze Changelog Status**
   - Read CHANGELOG.md and find the `## [Unreleased]` section
   - Identify all incomplete features (unchecked `- [ ]` items) in the [Unreleased] section
   - Create a TodoWrite list with all incomplete features found
   - Identify the first incomplete feature to work on
   - Display the feature being worked on to the user

2. **Understand Requirements**
   - Read CLAUDE.md for project overview and architecture principles
   - Read DESIGN.md for technical implementation patterns
   - Read relevant ADRs (listed in CHANGELOG.md next to features) for decision context
   - Read existing source code to understand current patterns
   - Use the Explore agent (Task tool with subagent_type=Explore) if you need to understand codebase structure

3. **Implement the Feature**
   - Create detailed implementation plan using TodoWrite with sub-tasks for:
     - Core implementation files
     - Unit test files
     - Any supporting infrastructure
   - Follow project conventions:
     - .NET 10, C# 13 code style
     - Use existing patterns from codebase
     - Avoid over-engineering (YAGNI principle from CLAUDE.md)
     - No unnecessary abstractions
     - Follow security best practices
   - Write clean, focused code that implements ONLY what's specified
   - Mark sub-tasks as completed in TodoWrite as you finish them

4. **Write Unit Tests**
   - Every feature MUST have comprehensive unit tests
   - Follow the three-tier testing strategy from DESIGN.md
   - Unit tests should:
     - Be fast (mocked dependencies)
     - Cover happy paths and error cases
     - Use xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions
     - Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
   - Name tests clearly: MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior

5. **Verify Implementation**
   - Run `dotnet build` to ensure code compiles
   - Run `dotnet test` to execute all unit tests
   - Fix any compilation errors or test failures
   - Re-run tests until all pass
   - Do NOT mark feature as complete until all tests pass

6. **Mark Feature as Complete**
   - Once all tests pass and implementation is verified:
     - Read CHANGELOG.md
     - In the `## [Unreleased]` section, update the specific feature line from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
     - Write the updated CHANGELOG.md back
     - Confirm completion to the user with feature name

7. **Continue to Next Feature**
   - Re-read CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] section to find next incomplete feature
   - Repeat steps 2-7 until all features are complete
   - If all features are complete, report success to user

8. **Handle Errors and Blockers**
   - If you encounter an error or blocker:
     - Document the issue clearly
     - Attempt to resolve it (read docs, fix code, adjust approach)
     - If unresolvable, ask user for guidance using AskUserQuestion
     - Do NOT mark feature as complete if blocked
     - Keep the current feature as in_progress in TodoWrite

## Resumption Behavior

When the work-on-features skill is invoked:

- ALWAYS start by reading CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] section to check current status
- If there are unchecked features, continue from the first unchecked item
- If all features are checked, report completion and success
- Use CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] section as the single source of truth for progress

## Important Guidelines

- **One feature at a time**: Focus completely on one feature before moving to next
- **Tests are mandatory**: Never mark a feature complete without passing tests
- **Follow project docs**: CLAUDE.md, DESIGN.md, and ADRs are your requirements
- **CHANGELOG.md is source of truth**: Only mark items complete in CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] section when fully done
- **Be thorough**: Each feature should be production-ready, not a stub
- **Ask when uncertain**: Use AskUserQuestion for ambiguous requirements
- **Show progress**: Keep TodoWrite updated so user sees progress
- **Commit-ready code**: Write code that's ready for git commit (clean, tested, working)

## Testing Requirements

- All unit tests must pass before marking feature complete
- Run tests with: `dotnet test`
- If tests fail, fix the implementation or tests, then re-run
- Unit tests should run quickly (mock external dependencies)
- Follow existing test organization in the codebase

## Example Workflow

```
1. Read CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] section → Find "OAuth device code flow implementation" unchecked
2. Create TodoWrite with sub-tasks:
   - Implement DeviceCodeAuthenticator class
   - Add token refresh logic
   - Write unit tests for auth flow
   - Write unit tests for token refresh
3. Implement DeviceCodeAuthenticator
4. Write comprehensive unit tests
5. Run: dotnet build && dotnet test
6. Fix any failures, re-run tests
7. All tests pass → Update CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]: `- [x] OAuth device code flow...`
8. Move to next feature
```

## Output Format

Always provide clear status updates:

- "📋 Found X incomplete features in CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]"
- "🔨 Working on: [Feature Name]"
- "✅ Tests passed for: [Feature Name]"
- "✓ Marked complete in CHANGELOG.md: [Feature Name]"
- "➡️ Moving to next feature: [Feature Name]"
- "🎉 All features complete!"

## Critical Success Criteria

A feature is ONLY complete when:

1. ✅ Implementation code is written and follows project patterns
2. ✅ Unit tests are written and comprehensive
3. ✅ `dotnet build` succeeds with no errors
4. ✅ `dotnet test` succeeds with all tests passing
5. ✅ CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] checkbox is marked as complete `- [x]`

Now begin by reading CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] section and starting work on the first incomplete feature.
