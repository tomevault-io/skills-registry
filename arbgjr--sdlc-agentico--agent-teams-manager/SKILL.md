# Agent Teams Manager

> **Philosophy**: Hybrid approach - Agent Teams for research/discussion phases, Parallel Workers for implementation phases.

## Quick Start

**Example** (orchestrator auto-selects strategy):
```python
# Phase 1 (Discovery) - Auto-selects Agent Teams
strategy = select_strategy(phase=1, complexity=2, task_count=3)
# Returns: "agent_teams" (research benefits from discussion)

# Phase 6 (Implementation) - Auto-selects Parallel Workers
strategy = select_strategy(phase=6, complexity=2, task_count=3)
# Returns: "parallel_workers" (isolation prevents conflicts)
```

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- **Orchestrator needs to parallelize work** across multiple agents
- **Phase 1, 2, 3, or 6** with 2+ concurrent tasks
- **Research/architecture discussions** benefit from real-time collaboration
- **Debugging with competing hypotheses** (Agent Teams enables debate)
- **Code reviews** requiring multiple specialized perspectives

DO NOT use when:
- Single-agent sequential execution is sufficient
- Phase 6 (Implementation) editing same files (use parallel-workers instead)
- Token budget is critical (Agent Teams uses 3x tokens)
- Feature flag `agent_teams` is disabled

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Strategy Selection (Auto)

**Use when**: Orchestrator needs to decide parallelization approach

**Steps**:
1. Read `.claude/settings.json` → Check `sdlc.feature_flags.agent_teams`
2. If `agent_teams: false` → Return "parallel_workers" (only option)
3. If `agent_teams: true`:
   - Check current phase number
   - Check complexity level (0-3)
   - Check task count
   - Check task characteristics (research vs implementation)
4. Apply strategy selection logic:
   - **Phase 1, 2, 3, 6** AND research/review → "agent_teams"
   - **Phase 6 (Implementation)** AND file editing → "parallel_workers"
   - **Task count < 2** → "sequential"
   - **Token budget exhausted** → "sequential"
5. Log decision with rationale

**Strategy Selection Logic**:
```markdown
IF agent_teams flag is disabled:
  RETURN "parallel_workers" (fallback)

IF phase in [1, 2, 3, 6] AND task_type in ["research", "review", "architecture"]:
  RETURN "agent_teams"  # Discussion benefits from real-time collaboration

IF phase == 6 AND task_type == "implementation":
  RETURN "parallel_workers"  # File isolation prevents conflicts

IF task_count < 2:
  RETURN "sequential"  # No parallelization needed

ELSE:
  RETURN "sequential"  # Conservative default
```

**Example**:
```markdown
# Phase 1 (Discovery): 3 domain-researcher tasks
- Current phase: 1
- Task type: research
- Task count: 3
→ Decision: "agent_teams" (research benefits from discussion)

# Phase 6 (Implementation): 4 code-author tasks
- Current phase: 6
- Task type: implementation
- Task count: 4
→ Decision: "parallel_workers" (file isolation required)

# Phase 3 (Architecture): 2 architects debating
- Current phase: 3
- Task type: architecture
- Task count: 2
→ Decision: "agent_teams" (architecture requires trade-off debate)
```

**Common Issues**:
- **Problem**: Agent Teams not available (experimental flag not set)
- **Solution**: Fallback to parallel_workers or sequential. Log warning.

### Workflow 2: Create Agent Team

**Use when**: Strategy selection returned "agent_teams"

**Steps**:
1. Validate prerequisites:
   - `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in environment
   - Team name is unique (check `~/.claude/teams/`)
   - Phase is in allowed list ([1, 2, 3, 6])
2. Define team structure:
   - Lead agent (coordinates, synthesizes, makes decisions)
   - Teammate agents (execute tasks, provide perspectives)
   - Shared task list
3. Create team configuration:
   ```bash
   claude team create {team-name} \
     --lead {lead-agent} \
     --teammates {agent1},{agent2},{agent3}
   ```
4. Assign tasks to teammates:
   ```bash
   # Each teammate claims tasks from shared list
   claude team assign {team-name} {teammate} {task-id}
   ```
5. Monitor team progress:
   - Check task statuses
   - Watch for blockers
   - Facilitate messaging if needed
6. Synthesize results:
   - Lead agent collects teammate outputs
   - Creates final deliverable
   - Commits to git

**Example**:
```markdown
# Phase 1 (Discovery): Research Kafka best practices
1. Create team:
   - Lead: domain-researcher (coordinates)
   - Teammate 1: doc-crawler (searches official docs)
   - Teammate 2: domain-researcher-2 (searches patterns)
   - Teammate 3: rag-curator (indexes findings)

2. Assign tasks:
   - doc-crawler → "Fetch Kafka official documentation"
   - domain-researcher-2 → "Research Kafka patterns in corpus"
   - rag-curator → "Index findings for future queries"

3. Teammates message each other:
   - doc-crawler: "Found Kafka Streams API docs"
   - domain-researcher-2: "Event Sourcing pattern common"
   - Lead synthesizes: "Kafka Streams + Event Sourcing recommended"

4. Lead commits decision as ADR
```

**Common Issues**:
- **Problem**: Experimental flag not set → Team creation fails
- **Solution**: Check `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`, warn user

- **Problem**: Teammates editing same file → Merge conflicts
- **Solution**: Detect file collision, switch to parallel_workers strategy

---

### Workflow 3: Spawn Parallel Workers

**Use when**: Strategy selection returned "parallel_workers"

**Steps**:
1. Delegate to `parallel-workers` skill:
   - Read tasks from Phase 5 (Planning) output
   - Create git worktrees for isolation
   - Spawn workers with assigned tasks
   - Monitor PR creation
   - Run automation loop
2. Wait for workers to complete
3. Merge PRs through gate-evaluator

**Example**:
```markdown
# Phase 6 (Implementation): 3 parallel tasks
1. Call parallel-workers skill:
   /parallel-spawn --batch tasks.yml

2. Workers execute in isolation:
   - Worker 1: Implements authentication
   - Worker 2: Implements payment gateway
   - Worker 3: Writes integration tests

3. PRs created automatically
4. Security gate validates before merge
```

**Common Issues**:
- **Problem**: Disk space exhausted (worktrees use disk)
- **Solution**: Cleanup old worktrees, reduce max_workers

---

### Workflow 4: Fallback to Sequential

**Use when**: Strategy selection returned "sequential"

**Steps**:
1. Log reason for sequential execution:
   - Task count too small (< 2)
   - Token budget exhausted
   - Feature flags disabled
2. Execute tasks one by one:
   - Call agent for task 1
   - Wait for completion
   - Call agent for task 2
   - Repeat
3. Commit after all tasks complete

**Example**:
```markdown
# Single research task - no parallelization needed
1. Strategy: "sequential" (task_count=1)
2. Execute: domain-researcher researches Kafka
3. Commit: ADR created
```

## Strategy Selection Reference

### Phase-Specific Recommendations

| Phase | Name | Recommended Strategy | Rationale |
|-------|------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Discovery | **agent_teams** | Research benefits from parallel exploration and discussion |
| 2 | Requirements | **agent_teams** | Requirements emerge from collaborative refinement |
| 3 | Architecture | **agent_teams** | Architecture requires debate of trade-offs and alternatives |
| 6 | Implementation | **parallel_workers** | File isolation prevents merge conflicts |
| 7 | Quality | **agent_teams** | QA benefits from multiple specialized perspectives |

### Task Type Detection

**Research Tasks** (Agent Teams preferred):
- Keywords: "research", "explore", "investigate", "analyze", "compare"
- Agents: domain-researcher, doc-crawler, rag-curator
- Output: Documentation, ADRs, learnings

**Implementation Tasks** (Parallel Workers preferred):
- Keywords: "implement", "code", "write", "build", "develop"
- Agents: code-author, test-author, iac-engineer
- Output: Source code, tests, infrastructure

**Review Tasks** (Agent Teams preferred):
- Keywords: "review", "audit", "validate", "assess", "evaluate"
- Agents: code-reviewer, qa-analyst, security-scanner
- Output: Reports, findings, recommendations

### Token Budget Considerations

| Strategy | Token Multiplier | When to Use |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Sequential | 1x | Token budget < 50k or task_count = 1 |
| Parallel Workers | 1x | Token budget normal, implementation phase |
| Agent Teams | 3x | Token budget healthy (> 100k), research/review |

## Configuration

### Feature Flag (`.claude/settings.json`)

```json
{
  "sdlc": {
    "feature_flags": {
      "agent_teams": false  // Experimental - disable by default
    },
    "parallelization": {
      "strategies": {
        "parallel_workers": {
          "enabled": true,
          "phases": [6],
          "max_workers": 5
        },
        "agent_teams": {
          "enabled": false,  // Follows feature_flags.agent_teams
          "phases": [1, 2, 3, 6],
          "token_budget_multiplier": 3.0
        }
      },
      "strategy_selection": "auto"  // or "manual"
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` | Yes | `0` | Enable experimental Agent Teams feature in Claude Code |

**To enable Agent Teams**:
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
```

---

## Integration

### With Other Skills

- **parallel-workers**: Fallback when Agent Teams unavailable or inappropriate
- **gate-evaluator**: Validates outputs from both strategies
- **phase-commit**: Commits results after parallelization completes
- **rag-curator**: Indexes learnings from Agent Team discussions

### With Agents

- **orchestrator** (Phase 0-9): Primary consumer - calls this skill for parallelization decisions
- **delivery-planner** (Phase 5): Generates task lists consumed by parallelization strategies
- **system-architect** (Phase 3): Uses Agent Teams for architecture debates

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Agent Teams feature not available

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check environment variable
echo $CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS

# Should output: 1
# If not, enable:
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
```

---

**Issue**: High token usage with Agent Teams

**Solution**:
- Monitor token budget: `/token-status`
- Reduce teammate count (max 3 recommended)
- Switch to parallel_workers for implementation
- Disable agent_teams flag if budget critical

---

**Issue**: Team status shows "lag" or stale data

**Solution**:
```bash
# Manually refresh task list
claude team refresh {team-name}

# Check teammate status
claude team status {team-name}
```

---

**Issue**: Teammates editing same file → Merge conflicts

**Solution**:
- **Prevention**: Use parallel_workers for implementation (isolates files)
- **Detection**: Monitor file paths in tasks, warn if overlap detected
- **Recovery**: Coordinate manual merge or reassign tasks

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Phase 1 Discovery with Agent Teams

**Scenario**: Research Kafka for new event-driven architecture

**Input**:
```yaml
phase: 1
complexity: 2
tasks:
  - "Research Kafka official documentation"
  - "Find Kafka patterns in corpus"
  - "Index Kafka learnings for future use"
```

**Process**:
```markdown
1. Read settings → agent_teams enabled
2. Detect: Phase 1, research tasks, 3 tasks
3. Strategy: "agent_teams" (research benefits from discussion)
4. Create team:
   - Lead: domain-researcher
   - Teammates: doc-crawler, rag-curator
5. Teammates work in parallel:
   - doc-crawler fetches official docs
   - rag-curator searches corpus
   - Lead synthesizes findings
6. Team discusses via messaging
7. Lead creates ADR with recommendations
8. Commit to git
```

**Output**:
```markdown
ADR-015: Adopt Kafka for Event-Driven Architecture
- Kafka Streams API for event processing
- Event Sourcing pattern recommended
- Indexed 15 Kafka patterns in corpus
```

---

### Example 2: Phase 6 Implementation with Parallel Workers

**Scenario**: Implement 3 microservices concurrently

**Input**:
```yaml
phase: 6
complexity: 2
tasks:
  - "Implement authentication service"
  - "Implement payment gateway"
  - "Write integration tests"
```

**Process**:
```markdown
1. Read settings → agent_teams enabled
2. Detect: Phase 6, implementation tasks, 3 tasks, file editing
3. Strategy: "parallel_workers" (file isolation required)
4. Delegate to parallel-workers skill
5. Workers execute in isolated worktrees
6. PRs created automatically
7. Security gate validates
8. Merge to main
```

**Output**:
```markdown
3 PRs created:
- PR #42: feat(auth): Add authentication service
- PR #43: feat(payment): Add payment gateway integration
- PR #44: test(integration): Add E2E tests

All passed security gate, merged to main.
```

---

### Example 3: Fallback to Sequential

**Scenario**: Single architecture task, no parallelization needed

**Input**:
```yaml
phase: 3
complexity: 1
tasks:
  - "Create ADR for database selection"
```

**Process**:
```markdown
1. Read settings → agent_teams enabled
2. Detect: Phase 3, 1 task
3. Strategy: "sequential" (task_count < 2, no parallelization needed)
4. Execute: system-architect creates ADR
5. Commit to git
```

**Output**:
```markdown
ADR-016: Use PostgreSQL for Relational Data
- Single task, no parallelization overhead
- Completed in 5 minutes
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use Agent Teams for Phase 6 implementation (file conflicts)
- Enable Agent Teams when token budget < 50k
- Create teams for single-task scenarios
- Hardcode strategy selection (use auto-detection)

✅ **DO**:
- Use hybrid approach (teams for research, workers for code)
- Monitor token usage with Agent Teams
- Fallback to parallel_workers when teams unavailable
- Log strategy selection rationale
