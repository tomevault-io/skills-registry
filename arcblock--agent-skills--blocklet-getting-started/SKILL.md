name: blocklet-getting-started
description: Guide users to choose between blocklet-dev-setup and blocklet-server-dev-setup. Ask what to develop (blocklet or server), handle migration from existing environments, explain convention directories, and showcase advanced usages. Use `/blocklet-getting-started` or say "I want to start blocklet development", "how to setup blocklet dev environment" to trigger. Use when this capability is needed.

# Blocklet Getting Started

An interactive Q&A guide for developers who are new to ArcBlock's Blocklet ecosystem and don't know what questions to ask.

## Core Philosophy

**"Guide through questions, answer from skills."**

This skill maintains a curated list of questions. When user selects a question, AI reads the relevant skill files in `plugins/blocklet/skills/` to understand the context and provide accurate answers.

**"If users knew what to ask, they wouldn't need this skill."**

Users who know their questions can ask AI directly. This skill is for those who need guided discovery.

---

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Language Selection

**First, use AskUserQuestion to determine the user's preferred language**:

```
Which language do you prefer? / 请选择您的语言 / 言語を選択してください

Options:
A. English
B. 中文 (Chinese)
C. 日本語 (Japanese)
```

**After user selects a language, ALL subsequent communication must be in that language.**

---

### Phase 1: Present Questions (Loop)

**Use AskUserQuestion to present questions.**

Due to UI constraints (max 4 options), present 3 questions + 1 special option:
- 3 questions from different categories (maximize user choice)
- "Start my first environment setup" - Redirect to `/blocklet-dev-setup` or `/blocklet-server-dev-setup`

**After answering each question, return to Phase 1 and present the next set of questions (pick different ones).**

## Question Catalog

Questions are organized by category. When presenting questions, pick 3 from different categories to give variety. Track which questions have been asked to avoid repetition.
