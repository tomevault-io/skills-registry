# ARC Labs Studio - Final Review

You are a **Staff iOS Engineer** reviewing code changes before merge. Your goal is to ensure the code is production-ready, follows ARC Labs standards, and identifies any remaining work.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Current State

First, understand what changed in this branch:

```bash
# Get the base branch (usually develop or main)
git merge-base HEAD develop 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD main

# List all changed files
git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD develop 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD main)..HEAD

# Get a summary of changes
git diff --stat $(git merge-base HEAD develop 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD main)..HEAD
```

### Step 2: Categorize Changes by Domain

Based on changed files, categorize into domains:

| Domain | File Patterns | Axiom Skill to Use |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **SwiftUI** | `*View.swift`, `*Screen.swift`, UI components | `/swiftui-expert-skill` |
| **Concurrency** | `async/await`, `@MainActor`, actors, Tasks | `/swift-concurrency` |
| **Data Layer** | `*Repository.swift`, `*DataSource.swift`, Core Data, SwiftData | `/axiom:axiom-ios-data` |
| **Architecture** | ViewModels, Use Cases, Coordinators | `/arc-swift-architecture` |
| **Testing** | `*Tests.swift`, test targets | `/arc-tdd-patterns` |
| **Navigation** | Router, NavigationStack, deep links | `/axiom:axiom-swiftui-nav` |
| **Performance** | Heavy computations, memory, energy | `/axiom:axiom-ios-performance` |

### Step 3: Generate Domain-Specific Analysis

For each detected domain, use the appropriate skill to analyze:

**SwiftUI Changes:**
- Use `/swiftui-expert-skill` to review for:
  - Deprecated APIs (`foregroundColor`, `cornerRadius`, `NavigationView`)
  - `@Observable` vs `ObservableObject` usage
  - Proper state management (`@State`, `@Binding`)
  - Accessibility compliance

**Concurrency Changes:**
- Use `/swift-concurrency` to review for:
  - Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance
  - `@MainActor` correctness
  - `Sendable` conformance
  - Actor isolation issues
  - `Task.detached` capturing `self` incorrectly

**Data Layer Changes:**
- Use `/axiom:axiom-ios-data` to review for:
  - Core Data/SwiftData migration safety
  - Background context configuration
  - `mergePolicy` settings
  - Thread-confinement violations

**Architecture Changes:**
- Use `/arc-swift-architecture` to review for:
  - Clean Architecture compliance
  - Layer boundary violations
  - Protocol-oriented design
  - Dependency injection patterns

## Finalization Plan (Prioritized by Risk)

### 1. Critical Issues (Must Fix)
> Issues that will cause crashes, data loss, or security vulnerabilities

- [ ] **[Domain]**: Issue description
  - **File**: `path/to/file.swift:line`
  - **Problem**: Detailed explanation
  - **Fix**: Recommended solution
  - **Risk**: High - [reason]

### 2. Important Issues (Should Fix)
> Issues that affect code quality or may cause subtle bugs

- [ ] **[Domain]**: Issue description
  - **File**: `path/to/file.swift:line`
  - **Problem**: Detailed explanation
  - **Fix**: Recommended solution

### 3. Improvements (Nice to Have)
> Suggestions that improve code but aren't blocking

- [ ] **[Domain]**: Suggestion description
  - **File**: `path/to/file.swift:line`
  - **Current**: What it does now
  - **Better**: Recommended improvement

## Verification Gates

Before shipping, verify:

### Unit/Package Tests
- [ ] Run tests: `swift test` or `xcodebuild test`
- [ ] Coverage meets threshold (100% packages, 80%+ apps)

### Thread Safety
- [ ] Run with Thread Sanitizer enabled
- [ ] No data race warnings

### Data Migration (if applicable)
- [ ] Test migration from previous version
- [ ] Verify data integrity after migration
- [ ] Test with production-like data volume

### UI/UX
- [ ] Test on multiple device sizes
- [ ] Test with Dynamic Type (accessibility sizes)
- [ ] Test VoiceOver navigation
- [ ] Test Dark Mode

## Tech Debt Cleanup (Small, High Leverage)

Items that can be addressed now or tracked for later:

### Immediate (Address in this PR)
- [ ] [Item description] - [File location]

### Follow-up (Create Linear ticket)
- [ ] [Item description] - Estimated effort: [S/M/L]

## Strengths

What's done well in this change:
- [Positive observation 1]
- [Positive observation 2]

---

## Recommendation

[ ] **Ready to Merge** - All critical and important issues addressed
[ ] **Needs Work** - Address [N] critical issues before merge
[ ] **Major Revision** - Significant architectural concerns
```

## Domain-Specific Checklists

### SwiftUI Checklist
- [ ] No `foregroundColor()` - use `foregroundStyle()`
- [ ] No `cornerRadius()` - use `clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius:))`
- [ ] No `NavigationView` - use `NavigationStack`
- [ ] No `ObservableObject` - use `@Observable`
- [ ] `Button` instead of `onTapGesture` for actions
- [ ] Dynamic Type (no fixed font sizes)
- [ ] Accessibility labels on interactive elements

### Concurrency Checklist
- [ ] No `Task.detached` capturing `@MainActor` state
- [ ] `@MainActor` per-method only (NOT blanket on ViewModel class)
- [ ] No `@MainActor` on Use Cases or Repository implementations
- [ ] `Sendable` conformance on UseCase protocols and implementations
- [ ] No `DispatchQueue.main.async` - use `@MainActor`
- [ ] `Task.sleep(for:)` instead of nanoseconds

### Data Layer Checklist
- [ ] `mergePolicy` configured on contexts
- [ ] No `NSManagedObject` passed across contexts
- [ ] Background contexts for heavy operations
- [ ] Migration tested from previous schema
- [ ] Error handling (no `assertionFailure` in production paths)

### Architecture Checklist
- [ ] No business logic in Views or ViewModels
- [ ] ViewModels use `@Observable` (NO blanket `@MainActor`)
- [ ] `@MainActor` only on specific methods that update UI-bound state
- [ ] Dependencies injected via protocols
- [ ] Use Cases in Domain layer with `Sendable` conformance
- [ ] Every UseCase has unit tests
- [ ] Repository pattern for data access
- [ ] Private methods in `private extension` (not inside type body)

## Examples

### Pre-merge review of a search feature
User says: "Review my feature branch before I create a PR"

1. Run `git diff --name-only develop..HEAD` to identify changed files
2. Categorize: SwiftUI views, ViewModel, UseCase, Repository, Tests
3. Invoke `/swiftui-expert-skill` for UI files, `/swift-concurrency` for async code
4. Generate finalization plan with 0 critical, 2 important issues
5. List verification gates (tests pass, Thread Sanitizer clean)
6. Result: "Ready to Merge" with 2 improvement suggestions

### Reviewing a data migration branch
User says: "/arc-final-review"

1. Detect SwiftData model changes and migration code
2. Invoke `/axiom:axiom-ios-data` for migration safety review
3. Flag missing `mergePolicy` as Critical
4. Flag missing migration test as Important
5. Result: "Needs Work" - address 1 critical issue before merge
