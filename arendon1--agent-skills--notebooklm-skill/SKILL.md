# NotebookLM Research Assistant

Interact with Google NotebookLM to query your documentation library.

## 🚀 Self-Deployment & Bootstrapping

If this skill's research workflows (like `/notebook-research`, `/notebook-study`) are not appearing in your agent's slash-commands, run the following command from the skill's root directory:
`python scripts/run.py bootstrap.py --workspace .`

This will automatically detect your agent's configuration directory (e.g., `.agents`, `.cursor`, `.gemini`, or `.agent`) and deploy the necessary `.md` or `.mdc` files.

## Essential Commands

**ALWAYS use `scripts/run.py` wrapper.**

### 1. Unified Interface (Recommendation)

Use the new bridge for all operations. It handles authentication automatically from storage.

```bash
python scripts/run.py unified_bridge.py list
python scripts/run.py unified_bridge.py create --title "Project Beta"
python scripts/run.py unified_bridge.py ask --notebook-id [ID] --question "..."
```

### 2. Research & Learning Workflows

Invoke these from the workspace root for high-level orchestration:

- `/notebook-research [TOPIC]`: Deep dive research and source aggregation.
- `/notebook-study [ID]`: Active learning with quizes/flashcards.
- `/notebook-visualize [ID]`: Generate Mind-Maps.

### 3. Artifact Generation

```bash
python scripts/run.py unified_bridge.py artifact --notebook-id [ID] --type audio
python scripts/run.py unified_bridge.py artifact --notebook-id [ID] --type quiz
python scripts/run.py unified_bridge.py artifact --notebook-id [ID] --type mind-map
```

## Workflow

1. **Discover / Sync**: **ALWAYS** run `python scripts/run.py unified_bridge.py list` first to see existing NotebookLM projects. Do not create new ones blindly; be aware of what is already present!
2. **Research**: Call `/notebook-research` to initialize.
3. **Optimize**: Use `/gh-learn` to find secondary sources and add them.
4. **Study**: Run `/notebook-study` to verify comprehension.
5. **Visualize**: Use `/notebook-visualize` for architectural insight.
