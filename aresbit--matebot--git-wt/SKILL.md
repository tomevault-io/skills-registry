# Git Worktree Workflow (git-wt)

## Overview

This skill provides a streamlined Git workflow using the **bare repository pattern** with the `git-wt` tool. Instead of stashing and switching branches, worktrees allow multiple branches to coexist simultaneously in separate directories while sharing a single git history.

**Key Benefits:**
- No more `git stash` context switching
- Parallel development on multiple features
- Isolated environments for AI agents
- Clean, organized workspace with branches as directories

## Quick Start

### Installation

The skill includes the `git-wt` script. Install it to your PATH:

```bash
# Copy to a directory in your PATH
cp /Users/mac/.claude/skills/git-wt/scripts/git-wt ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/git-wt

# Or use the install helper
bash /Users/mac/.claude/skills/git-wt/scripts/install.sh
```

**Requirements:**
- Git 2.7+
- fzf (optional, for interactive commands)

### Clone a New Repository

```bash
git wt clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo/main
```

This creates the bare structure:
```
repo/
├── .bare/          # All git data
├── .git            # Pointer to .bare
└── main/           # Worktree for main branch
```

### Migrate Existing Repository

```bash
cd existing-repo
git wt migrate
```

## Daily Workflow

### Create a Worktree

**Interactive mode** (with fzf):
```bash
git wt add
```

**Direct mode**:
```bash
# From remote branch
git wt add feature-auth origin/feature-auth

# Create new branch
git wt add -b my-feature my-feature
```

### Switch Between Worktrees

```bash
# Interactive picker
cd $(git wt switch)

# Or add a shell function to .bashrc/.zshrc:
wt() {
    local dir
    dir=$(git wt switch)
    [[ -n "$dir" ]] && cd "$dir"
}
```

### Remove Worktrees

```bash
# Remove worktree and local branch
git wt remove feature-branch

# Remove worktree, local AND remote branch (destructive)
git wt destroy old-experiment

# Dry run to preview what would be removed
git wt remove --dry-run
```

### Update Repository

```bash
# Fetch all remotes and fast-forward default branch
git wt update
```

## Commands Reference

See [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) for detailed command documentation.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `git wt clone <url>` | Clone with bare structure |
| `git wt migrate` | Convert existing repo to worktree |
| `git wt add [options]` | Create worktree (interactive or direct) |
| `git wt remove [name]` | Remove worktree and local branch |
| `git wt destroy [name]` | Remove worktree + local + remote branch |
| `git wt switch` | Interactive worktree picker |
| `git wt update` / `u` | Fetch all and update default branch |
| `git wt list` | List all worktrees |

## Best Practices

1. **Keep `main/` pristine** - Never work directly in it. Use as clean reference for diffing.
2. **Name worktrees after branches** - Directory = branch = no confusion.
3. **Limit active worktrees** - 2-3 is ideal. Each is a full checkout.
4. **Project-level config** - Store `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.env` at project root (outside worktrees).

## AI Agent Workflow

Worktrees are ideal for AI coding agents:

```bash
# You're working on feature-A
cd ~/project/feature-A

# Spin up worktree for agent
git wt add -b agent-refactor ../agent-refactor

# Agent works independently
# You keep working uninterrupted

# Review agent's work
git diff main...agent-refactor
```

## The Bare Repo Pattern

See [references/bare-repo-pattern.md](references/bare-repo-pattern.md) for detailed explanation.

**Structure:**
```
my-project/
├── .bare/            # All git data (bare repository)
├── .git              # File pointing to .bare
├── main/             # Worktree: main branch
└── feature/          # Worktree: feature branch
```

**Why it works:**
- Single `.bare/` directory for all git data
- Worktrees are subdirectories (organized)
- Delete the folder = everything gone (no orphans)
- Project-level configs outside version control

## Troubleshooting

**"git wt: command not found"**
- Ensure `git-wt` is in your PATH
- Try: `~/.local/bin/git-wt --help`

**Worktree already exists**
- Use `git wt remove <name>` first
- Or choose a different name

**No upstream configured**
- `git wt add` sets upstream automatically
- Manual fix: `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch>`
