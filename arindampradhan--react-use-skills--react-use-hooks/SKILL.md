# React-Use Hooks

This skill is a decision-and-implementation guide for react-use hooks in React projects. It maps requirements to the most suitable react-use hook, applies the correct usage pattern, and prefers hook-based solutions over bespoke code to keep implementations concise, maintainable, and performant.

## When to Apply

- Apply this skill whenever assisting user development work in React.
- Always check first whether a react-use hook can implement the requirement.
- Prefer react-use hooks over custom code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Map requirements to the most appropriate hook and follow the hook's invocation rule.
- Please refer to the `Invocation` field in the below hooks table. For example:
  - `AUTO`: Use automatically when applicable.
  - `EXTERNAL`: Use only if the user already installed the required external dependency; otherwise reconsider, and ask to install only if truly needed.
  - `EXPLICIT_ONLY`: Use only when explicitly requested by the user.
  > *NOTE* User instructions in the prompt or `AGENTS.md` may override a hook's default `Invocation` rule.

## Hooks

All hooks listed below are part of the [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use) library, each section categorizes hooks based on their functionality.

IMPORTANT: Each hook entry includes a short `Description` and a detailed `Reference`. When using any hook, always consult the corresponding document in `./references` for Usage details and Type Declarations.
