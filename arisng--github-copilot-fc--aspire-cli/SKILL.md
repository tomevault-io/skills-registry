description: Guidance for using the .NET Aspire CLI and agent integration to create, adopt, run, inspect, debug, update, publish, deploy, and automate Aspire AppHosts. Use when choosing or explaining Aspire commands and workflows such as aspire new, init, restore, run, start, ps, stop, wait, resource, describe, logs, otel, add, update, publish, deploy, do, doctor, docs, or agent; when setting up AI coding agents with aspire agent init or aspire agent mcp; when troubleshooting distributed apps with resource status, logs, traces, and endpoints; or when running multiple AppHost instances in parallel with --isolated. Use when this capability is needed.

# Aspire CLI

Use this skill to choose the right Aspire workflow, keep long-running processes under Aspire's control, and combine AppHost source, CLI inspection, MCP tools, and browser automation into a tight agent loop.

## Fast path

1. Identify the goal: scaffold, adopt, configure agents, start attached or detached, inspect, debug, manage resources, update, or publish/deploy.
2. Confirm context: AppHost path, single vs multiple AppHosts, human-interactive vs automation, single instance vs parallel worktrees.
3. Prefer the smallest reliable surface:
   - `aspire doctor` for environment issues.
   - `aspire agent init` for agent setup.
   - `aspire run` for attached interactive sessions.
   - `aspire start` for background or delegated sessions.
   - `aspire run --isolated` or `aspire start --isolated` for parallel worktrees, background agents, or side-by-side validation.
   - `aspire describe`, `aspire logs`, `aspire otel`, `aspire wait`, and `aspire resource` for CLI-first inspection and control.
   - MCP tools when the Aspire MCP server is already configured and runtime access is needed from the agent.
4. Read the AppHost source before changing orchestration. The AppHost is the topology source of truth.
5. Load only the reference files that match the task.

## Decision guide

| Goal | Default workflow |
| --- | --- |
| Create a new Aspire solution | `aspire new` |
| Add Aspire to an existing solution | `aspire init` -> wire AppHost -> `aspire run` |
| Set up AI coding agents | `aspire agent init` |
| Start in foreground | `aspire run` |
| Start in background | `aspire start` |
| Run multiple copies safely | `aspire run --isolated` or `aspire start --isolated` |
| Inspect resources and endpoints | `aspire describe` or MCP `list_resources` |
| Read logs and telemetry | `aspire logs`, `aspire otel`, or MCP log/trace tools |
| Wait for readiness in automation | `aspire wait <resource>` |
| Restart a single resource | `aspire resource <resource> restart` |
| Restore integrations or generated SDKs | `aspire restore` |
| Search docs or discover integrations | `aspire docs search ...`, `aspire add ...` |
| Publish or deploy | `aspire publish`, `aspire deploy`, `aspire do ...` |

## Agentic development workflow

1. Run `aspire doctor` when the environment, certificates, container runtime, or SDK look suspect.
2. Read the AppHost source to understand resources, references, parameters, and startup order.
3. Run `aspire agent init` if the repo does not already have Aspire agent configuration.
4. Start the app:
   - `aspire run` for an attached local debugging loop.
   - `aspire start --format Json` for background or delegated sessions.
   - Add `--isolated` when another worktree, agent, or test run may start the same AppHost.
5. Inspect runtime state with `aspire describe`, `aspire logs`, `aspire otel`, `aspire wait`, or MCP tools.
6. Apply code changes, then restart only the affected resource with `aspire resource <name> restart` when possible.
7. For UI validation, discover the live endpoint via Aspire, then load the `playwright-cli` skill to drive the browser.
8. Use telemetry to close the loop: build -> start -> inspect -> browser-check -> fix -> restart -> retest.

## Guardrails

- Do not guess topology from ad hoc scripts if an AppHost exists; read the AppHost source.
- Do not hardcode ports; use `aspire describe` or MCP `list_resources`.
- Do not scrape the dashboard when CLI or MCP already exposes structured output.
- Do not make the agent babysit several long-running dev servers when Aspire can manage them as one AppHost.
- Use `--isolated` whenever two copies of the same AppHost may run at once.
- Use `--format Json` and `--non-interactive` for automation and agent-driven flows.
- Prefer AppHost parameters and Aspire user secrets over committing secrets to repo `.env` files.
- `aspire exec` is for running a new command in a resource context; it is not a log reader.
- If multiple AppHosts are running, pass `--apphost <path>` or work from the intended AppHost folder to avoid ambiguity.

## Version focus

Target the Aspire 13.2 command surface first.

- `aspire agent init` and `aspire agent mcp` replace the older `aspire mcp ...` naming.
- `aspire start` is the detached-friendly shorthand; `aspire run --detach` remains valid.
- `aspire.config.json` is the preferred rooted config file; older `.aspire\settings.json` files may still appear during migration.
