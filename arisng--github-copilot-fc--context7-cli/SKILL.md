# Context7 CLI

This skill provides guidance for using the Context7 CLI (`ctx7`) to manage AI coding skills across different AI assistants.

## Installation

The Context7 CLI can be installed globally or run directly with npx:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g ctx7

# Or run directly (no installation needed)
npx ctx7
```

## Authentication

Before using authenticated features like skill generation, you need to log in:

```bash
# Log in (opens browser for OAuth)
ctx7 login

# Check login status
ctx7 whoami

# Log out
ctx7 logout
```

## Core Workflows

### Searching for Skills

Search the Context7 registry for skills by topic or technology:

```bash
# Search for skills
ctx7 skills search pdf
ctx7 skills search typescript
ctx7 skills search "react testing"
```

### Installing Skills

Install skills from the registry to your AI assistant:

```bash
# Install a specific skill
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf

# Install multiple skills
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf commit

# Install to specific AI assistant
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf --claude
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf --cursor

# Install globally (home directory)
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf --global
```

### Generating Custom Skills

Create new skills tailored to your needs using AI:

```bash
# Generate a skill (requires login)
ctx7 skills generate

# Generate for specific assistant
ctx7 skills generate --claude
ctx7 skills generate --cursor

# Short aliases
ctx7 skills gen
ctx7 skills g
```

The generation process:
1. Describe the expertise you want (e.g., "OAuth authentication with NextAuth.js")
2. Select relevant libraries from search results
3. Answer clarifying questions
4. Review and install the generated skill

### Managing Installed Skills

```bash
# List installed skills
ctx7 skills list
ctx7 skills list --claude
ctx7 skills list --global

# Get info about available skills in a project
ctx7 skills info /anthropics/skills

# Remove a skill
ctx7 skills remove pdf
ctx7 skills remove pdf --claude
```

## Supported AI Assistants

The CLI automatically detects and supports:

- Claude Code (`.claude/skills/`)
- Cursor (`.cursor/skills/`)
- Codex (`.codex/skills/`)
- OpenCode (`.opencode/skills/`)
- Amp (`.agents/skills/`)
- Antigravity (`.agent/skills/`)

## Common Use Cases

### Finding Skills for Specific Tasks

When a user needs skills for a particular technology or framework:

1. Search the registry: `ctx7 skills search <topic>`
2. Review results and install relevant skills
3. Verify installation with `ctx7 skills list`

### Setting Up a New Project

For new projects, install commonly needed skills:

```bash
# Install essential skills for web development
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills typescript react testing --claude
```

### Creating Custom Skills

When existing skills don't cover specific needs:

1. Use `ctx7 skills generate` for AI-assisted creation
2. Provide detailed description of required expertise
3. Review and refine the generated skill
4. Install to your preferred AI assistant

## Tips

- Use short aliases for faster workflow: `ctx7 si` (install), `ctx7 ss` (search)
- Skills are installed to project-specific directories by default
- Use `--global` flag for skills available across all projects
- Generation has weekly limits (6 free, 10 pro accounts)
- Visit [context7.com](https://context7.com) to browse the registry manually
