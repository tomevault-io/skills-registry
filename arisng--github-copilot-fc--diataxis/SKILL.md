description: Create and evaluate documentation using the Diátaxis framework. Use when writing, organizing, or auditing documentation to ensure it serves distinct user needs through four systematic categories (Tutorials, How-to Guides, Reference, Explanation). Ideal for diagnosing documentation problems, separating mixed content, and ensuring each piece serves a single, clear purpose. Use when this capability is needed.

# Diátaxis Documentation Skill

The **Diátaxis framework** organizes documentation by user need, not by topic. This skill helps you create documentation that works for your audience.

## The Four Categories

Diátaxis distinguishes four documentation needs using a 2×2 matrix:

|              | **Practical**     | **Theoretical** |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------- |
| **Learning** | **Tutorials**     | **Explanation** |
| **Working**  | **How-to Guides** | **Reference**   |

### Quick Reference

- **Tutorials** (Learning + Practical): "Teach me by doing"
- **How-to Guides** (Working + Practical): "Help me accomplish X"
- **Reference** (Working + Theoretical): "Tell me how things work"
- **Explanation** (Learning + Theoretical): "Help me understand why"

## Working With Documentation

### 1. Diagnose What You Have

When given documentation, determine which category it belongs to:

- **Is it teaching or working?** (Axis 1)
- **Is it practical or theoretical?** (Axis 2)
- **Does it serve a single purpose or is it mixed?**

### 2. Identify Problems

Common documentation problems map to mixing categories:

- **Tutorials polluted with explanation** → Users get lost in "why" when they should focus on "do"
- **How-to guides that teach** → Assumes no prior knowledge; should link to tutorials instead
- **Reference missing examples** → Should show, not just describe
- **Explanation that instructs** → Should link to how-to guides instead
- **Missing entire categories** → Product has only reference; users can't get started

### 3. Choose the Right Template

When writing documentation, use the appropriate template:

- **Writing a tutorial?** See [tutorial-template.md](references/tutorial-template.md)
- **Writing a how-to guide?** See [how-to-guide-template.md](references/how-to-guide-template.md)
- **Writing reference?** See [reference-template.md](references/reference-template.md)
- **Writing explanation?** See [explanation-template.md](references/explanation-template.md)
- **Want real-world examples?** See [examples.md](references/examples.md)

### 4. Apply Category-Specific Principles

See [framework.md](references/framework.md) for detailed principles, language patterns, and anti-patterns for each category.

### 5. Structure Output

Create documentation in this structure:

```
.docs/
├── tutorials/          # Learning-oriented lessons
│   └── [topic]/
├── how-to/             # Task-oriented guides
│   └── [domain]/
├── reference/          # Technical descriptions
│   └── [component]/
├── explanation/        # Conceptual discussions
│   └── [subject]/
└── index.md            # Navigation (generated automatically)
```

**Naming conventions:**
- Use `kebab-case` for all files and folders
- Tutorials: `getting-started-with-x.md`, `your-first-y.md`
- How-to: `how-to-configure-x.md`, `how-to-deploy-y.md`
- Reference: `api-reference.md`, `configuration-options.md`
- Explanation: `about-architecture.md`, `understanding-x.md`

### 6. Generate Index

Use the Python script to automatically generate the `index.md` file:

```bash
python skills/diataxis/scripts/generate_index.py
```

This script scans the `.docs/` subfolders, extracts titles from `.md` files, and creates links organized by category. Run it whenever you add or remove documentation files to keep the index up-to-date.

## Common Workflows

### Auditing existing documentation

1. Read through each document
2. Determine which category it belongs to
3. Flag content that belongs in other categories
4. Suggest extractions or links to separate content
5. Check for "category pollution" (mixing purposes)

### Writing new documentation

1. Identify the user need (learning/working, practical/theoretical)
2. Choose the appropriate category
3. Find the right template:
   - Tutorial: [tutorial-template.md](references/tutorial-template.md)
   - How-to: [how-to-guide-template.md](references/how-to-guide-template.md)
   - Reference: [reference-template.md](references/reference-template.md)
   - Explanation: [explanation-template.md](references/explanation-template.md)
4. Use category-specific language patterns (in template)
5. See [examples.md](references/examples.md) for production-grade examples
6. Save in the correct folder structure

### Refactoring mixed content

1. Read the mixed document
2. Identify sections that belong in different categories
3. Create separate files for each category
4. In each file, link to related content in other categories
5. Remove the original mixed document

### Generating the documentation index

To keep the documentation index consistent and up-to-date:

1. Ensure all documentation files are placed in the appropriate `.docs/` subfolders (`tutorials/`, `how-to/`, `reference/`, `explanation/`).
2. Run the generation script: `python skills/diataxis/scripts/generate_index.py`
3. The script will automatically scan for `.md` files, extract their titles, and update `.docs/index.md` with organized links.

This workflow should be used after adding new documents or restructuring existing ones.

## Key Principle

**Every document should serve exactly one user need.** When content serves multiple needs, separate it into multiple documents and link them together. This is better than trying to serve all needs in one place.

Remember: *The first rule of teaching is simply: don't try to teach.* Let the structure and the doing facilitate learning.
