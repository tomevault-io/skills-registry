description: Search across archived Copilot chat sessions (VS Code + CLI) using the copilot-session-tools CLI. Use when the user says "search my chats", "find in chat history", "what did we discuss about X", "look up past sessions", "scan chats", "session history", "recent session where", "earlier conversation", "previous session", "that session where", or references a session-state path or session GUID. Also covers exporting sessions as markdown or HTML and launching the web viewer. Use when this capability is needed.

# Search Copilot Chats

Search, browse, and export archived GitHub Copilot chat sessions from VS Code (Stable & Insiders) and the Copilot CLI. Uses the **copilot-session-tools** CLI backed by a local SQLite database with FTS5 full-text search. Requires Copilot CLI v0.0.412+ (`uv tool install copilot-session-tools[all]` if not on PATH).

**Do not memorize flags.** Run `copilot-session-tools <command> --help` for flags and examples. This skill only documents **domain knowledge that `--help` cannot teach**.

## When to use

- User asks to search past Copilot conversations ("what did we discuss about X?")
- User pastes a `session-state` path or session GUID and wants context from it
- User pastes a web viewer URL like `http://127.0.0.1:5000/session/{uuid}`
- User wants to find prior decisions, code patterns, or troubleshooting steps from past sessions
- User asks to export a session as markdown, HTML, or JSON

## Favor CLI over Python

**Always prefer CLI execution** over writing Python scripts. The CLI handles all common workflows. Only drop into Python/SQL when you need a custom join, aggregation, or programmatic processing the CLI doesn't support.

## Search strategy (critical — not in `--help`)

The FTS5 search uses **AND semantics**: every keyword in the query MUST appear in the **same message**. More keywords = stricter matching = fewer results. This is the #1 cause of empty search results.

**Start broad, narrow later.** Always begin with 1–2 core keywords. Only add more if you get too many results.

**Iterative approach.** If no results are returned, **remove** keywords (don't add more). Try synonyms. Drop field filters. The goal is to widen the net, not narrow it further.

**Field filters don't reduce keyword strictness.** A filter like `workspace:ZTS` narrows the *session pool*, but all FTS keywords still must match within a single message.

**Keyword budget.** Aim for **2–3 keywords max**. Use exact phrases for multi-word concepts (e.g., `"resource graph"` counts as 1 match unit).

### Search dos and don'ts

**❌ DON'T — these all returned zero results in real usage:**

| Failed query | Problem |
|---|---|
| `customer tenant query build SPN` | 5 loose keywords — ALL must appear in one message |
| `workspace:ZTS "resource graph" integration test permission` | Workspace filter + exact phrase + 3 keywords = too strict |
| `"build service" "resource graph" reader` | Two exact phrases + a keyword — very unlikely all in one message |
| `spec driven proposal specs design tasks` | 6 keywords, too many AND conditions |

**✅ DO — these succeeded:**

| Successful query | Why it works |
|---|---|
| `ARG build pipeline` | 3 focused keywords |
| `"resource graph" auth` | 1 exact phrase + 1 keyword |
| `workspace:ZTS ARG RBAC` | Workspace filter + only 2 keywords |
| `docker build` | 2 keywords, broad |

**Iterative search workflow:**

```
Step 1: copilot-session-tools search "resource graph" --full --limit 20
  → Too many results? Add ONE keyword:
Step 2: copilot-session-tools search "resource graph" auth --full --limit 20
  → Still too many? Add a workspace filter:
Step 3: copilot-session-tools search 'workspace:ZTS "resource graph" auth' --full --limit 10
  → No results? Back up and try different keyword:
Step 4: copilot-session-tools search 'workspace:ZTS "resource graph" permission' --full --limit 10
```

## Extract session references from user input

Users reference past sessions in several ways. Recognize and extract the session GUID:

| User provides | Extract |
|---|---|
| `C:\Users\...\session-state\{uuid}` or `~\.copilot\session-state\{uuid}` | The `{uuid}` portion |
| `http://127.0.0.1:5000/session/{uuid}` | The `{uuid}` portion |
| A bare GUID like `67894303-8571-...` | Use directly as session ID |
| A short prefix like `67894303` | Search: `copilot-session-tools search "67894303"` |

Then use `export-markdown --session-id` to retrieve the full session content.

## Direct SQL for advanced queries

When the CLI search doesn't support your query shape, use SQLite directly on `~/.copilot/session-store.db`:

```powershell
# Find sessions by workspace name
sqlite3 "$HOME/.copilot/session-store.db" "SELECT session_id, workspace_name, created_at FROM cst_sessions WHERE workspace_name LIKE '%zts%' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20"

# Count messages per session (find long conversations)
sqlite3 "$HOME/.copilot/session-store.db" "SELECT s.session_id, s.workspace_name, COUNT(m.id) as msg_count FROM cst_sessions s JOIN cst_messages m ON s.session_id = m.session_id GROUP BY s.session_id ORDER BY msg_count DESC LIMIT 20"

# Find sessions with tool invocations of a specific tool
sqlite3 "$HOME/.copilot/session-store.db" "SELECT DISTINCT s.session_id, s.workspace_name, s.created_at FROM cst_sessions s JOIN cst_messages m ON s.session_id = m.session_id JOIN cst_tool_invocations ti ON m.id = ti.message_id WHERE ti.name LIKE '%build%' ORDER BY s.created_at DESC LIMIT 20"

# Find file changes by path pattern
sqlite3 "$HOME/.copilot/session-store.db" "SELECT DISTINCT s.session_id, s.workspace_name, fc.path FROM cst_sessions s JOIN cst_messages m ON s.session_id = m.session_id JOIN cst_file_changes fc ON m.id = fc.message_id WHERE fc.path LIKE '%Dockerfile%' ORDER BY s.created_at DESC LIMIT 20"
```

## Database schema (quick reference)

The tool extends `~/.copilot/session-store.db` with `cst_*` enrichment tables. Built-in tables are never modified.

**Built-in tables** (managed by Copilot CLI, read-only):

| Table | Key columns |
|-------|-------------|
| `sessions` | id, cwd, repository, branch, summary, created_at |
| `turns` | session_id, turn_index, user_message, assistant_response |

**Enrichment tables** (managed by this tool, prefixed `cst_`):

| Table | Key columns |
|-------|-------------|
| `cst_sessions` | session_id, workspace_name, vscode_edition, custom_title, parser_version, source_format |
| `cst_messages` | session_id, message_index, role, content, timestamp |
| `cst_messages_fts` | content (FTS5 virtual table, synced via triggers) |
| `cst_tool_invocations` | message_id, name, input, result, status |
| `cst_file_changes` | message_id, path, diff, content |
| `cst_command_runs` | message_id, command, result, status, output |

## Workflow: "Continue where we left off"

1. Extract the session GUID from the user's input (see table above)
2. Export: `copilot-session-tools export-markdown --session-id <guid> -o .`
3. Read the exported file and continue the work

## Workflow: "Find how we solved X before"

1. Search: `copilot-session-tools search "<topic>" --full --limit 30`
2. Identify the most relevant session from results
3. Export: `copilot-session-tools export-markdown --session-id <guid> -o .`

## Known issues

- **Use `--json` for piped output.** The default Rich console output garbles Unicode box-drawing characters on Windows when piped. `--json` bypasses Rich entirely and is the preferred format for programmatic consumption.
- **Missing sessions**: If a session doesn't appear after scanning, check that the source file exists and wasn't cleaned up by VS Code. Use `--full` scan to force reimport.
