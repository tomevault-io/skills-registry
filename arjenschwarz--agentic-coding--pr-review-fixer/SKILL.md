description: Fetch unresolved PR comments (both code-level and PR-level), validate issues, and fix them. Also checks CI status and fixes failing tests, lint errors, and build issues. Use when reviewing and addressing GitHub PR feedback. Filters out resolved comments, keeps only the last claude[bot] comment per thread, validates issues, posts review report as a PR comment, then fixes validated issues. Use when this capability is needed.

# PR Review Fixer

Fetch unresolved PR comments, validate each issue, create a fix plan, implement fixes, and verify CI checks pass (tests, lint, build).

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch PR Comments

```bash
# Get PR info
PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')

# Get all PR comments via GraphQL (code-level AND PR-level)
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $pr) {
        # Code-level review comments (file/line specific)
        reviewThreads(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            comments(first: 50) {
              nodes { id body author { login } path line }
            }
          }
        }
        # PR-level review comments (top-level review body)
        reviews(first: 50) {
          nodes {
            id
            body
            state
            author { login }
          }
        }
        # PR-level issue comments (general discussion)
        comments(first: 100) {
          nodes {
            id
            body
            author { login }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
' -f owner=OWNER -f repo=REPO -F pr=$PR_NUM
```

### 2. Filter Comments

**Code-level comments (reviewThreads):**
1. **Exclude resolved threads**: Filter out threads where `isResolved: true`
2. **claude[bot] handling**: For `claude[bot]` comments, keep only the **last comment** per thread
3. **Group by file/location**: Organize by path and line number

**PR-level review comments (reviews):**
1. **Exclude empty bodies**: Skip reviews with empty or whitespace-only body
2. **Exclude approval-only**: Skip reviews with state `APPROVED` and no actionable feedback
3. **claude[bot] handling**: For `claude[bot]` reviews, keep only the **most recent** one

**PR-level issue comments (comments):**
1. **Exclude bot noise**: Skip automated comments (CI bots, etc.) unless actionable
2. **claude[bot] handling**: Keep only the **last** `claude[bot]` comment
3. **Identify actionable items**: Look for requested changes, questions, or suggestions

### 3. Determine Working Location

Review reports are posted as PR comments (not committed). Task files are local working files only.

**Working directory**: Use a temp directory or `.claude/reviews/PR-[number]/` for local task files during the session. These files are not committed.

**Iteration tracking**: Check existing PR comments by `claude[bot]` with "PR Review Overview" in the body. Count those to determine the current iteration number N.

### 4. Validate Issues

**Code-level comments:**
1. Read the referenced code at path:line
2. Evaluate: Is issue still present? Is suggestion correct? Does it align with project conventions?
3. Mark as valid or invalid with brief rationale

**PR-level comments:**
1. Parse the comment for actionable items (suggestions, questions, requested changes)
2. Check if the feedback applies to current PR state (changes may have been made since)
3. Evaluate: Is the request reasonable? Does it align with project goals?
4. Mark as valid or invalid with brief rationale
5. Skip pure acknowledgments, thanks, or informational comments without action items

### 5. Create Review Overview

Prepare the review overview content (this will be posted as a PR comment, not committed):

```markdown
# PR Review Overview - Iteration [N]

**PR**: #[number] | **Branch**: [name] | **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Valid Issues

### Code-Level Issues

#### Issue 1: [title]
- **File**: `path:line`
- **Reviewer**: @user
- **Comment**: [quoted]
- **Validation**: [rationale]

### PR-Level Issues

#### Issue 2: [title]
- **Type**: review comment | discussion comment
- **Reviewer**: @user
- **Comment**: [quoted]
- **Validation**: [rationale]

## Invalid/Skipped Issues

### Issue A: [title]
- **Location**: `path:line` or PR-level
- **Reviewer**: @user
- **Comment**: [quoted]
- **Reason**: [why invalid]
```

### 6. Create Task List

Use rune to create `review-fixes-[N].md`:

```bash
rune create ${OUTPUT_DIR}/review-fixes-${N}.md \
  --title "PR Review Fixes - Iteration ${N}" \
  --reference ${OUTPUT_DIR}/review-overview-${N}.md

# Add tasks via batch for efficiency
rune batch ${OUTPUT_DIR}/review-fixes-${N}.md --input '{
  "file": "review-fixes-'${N}'.md",
  "operations": [
    {"type": "add", "title": "Fix: [issue 1]"},
    {"type": "add", "title": "Fix: [issue 2]"}
  ]
}'
```

### 7. Fix Issues

Loop through tasks:
1. `rune next [file]` - get next task
2. `rune progress [file] [id]` - mark in-progress
3. Implement the fix
4. `rune complete [file] [id]` - mark complete
5. Repeat until done

### 8. Check CI Status

After fixing review comments, verify CI checks:

```bash
# Get check status for the PR
gh pr checks --json name,state,conclusion

# For failed checks, get details
gh run view [RUN_ID] --log-failed
```

**Check types to handle:**

1. **Test failures**: Parse test output, identify failing tests, fix code or tests
2. **Lint errors**: Run linter locally, fix reported issues
3. **Type errors**: Run type checker, fix type mismatches
4. **Build failures**: Check build logs, fix compilation issues

### 9. Fix CI Issues

For each failed check:

1. **Identify the failure type** from check name and logs
2. **Run locally** to reproduce:
   - Tests: `make test` or project's test command
   - Lint: `make lint` or project's lint command
   - Types: `make typecheck` or equivalent
3. **Parse error output** to identify specific failures
4. **Fix the issues**:
   - For test failures: Check if test expectations need updating or if code has a bug
   - For lint errors: Apply automatic fixes where possible, manual fixes otherwise
   - For type errors: Add/fix type annotations or fix type mismatches
5. **Re-run locally** to verify fix
6. **Add to task list** if not already tracked

**Test failure handling:**

```bash
# Run tests and capture output
make test 2>&1 | tee test-output.txt

# If using pytest
pytest --tb=short 2>&1 | tee test-output.txt

# If using go test
go test ./... 2>&1 | tee test-output.txt
```

Parse output for:
- Failed test names and locations
- Assertion errors with expected vs actual values
- Stack traces pointing to failure source

### 10. Resolve Fixed Threads

After fixing code-level issues, resolve the corresponding review threads on GitHub:

```bash
# For each fixed code-level thread, resolve it using its thread ID
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($threadId: ID!) {
    resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $threadId}) {
      thread { isResolved }
    }
  }
' -f threadId=THREAD_NODE_ID
```

Only resolve threads whose issues were validated and fixed. Do not resolve threads that were skipped or marked invalid — those need human attention.

### 11. Post Review Report as PR Comment

Post the review overview as a comment on the PR. This replaces committing report files.

```bash
# Post the review overview content as a PR comment
gh pr comment $PR_NUM --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
# PR Review Overview - Iteration [N]

**PR**: #[number] | **Branch**: [name] | **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Valid Issues (fixed)

[List of validated and fixed issues with file:line, reviewer, and brief description]

## Invalid/Skipped Issues

[List of skipped issues with rationale]

## CI Status

[Summary of CI check results and any fixes applied]
EOF
)"
```

**Do not commit** `review-overview-*.md` or `review-fixes-*.md` files. They are working files only.

### 12. Commit, Push, and Verify

After all fixes:

1. Run full test suite locally
2. Run linter
3. Commit **only code changes** (exclude any local review/task files)
4. Push to remote
5. Monitor CI status to confirm checks pass

## Key Behaviors

- **Auto-fix**: Fix all validated issues without pausing for approval
- **Context preservation**: Keep diff_hunk context when analyzing
- **Convention adherence**: Follow project's existing patterns
- **Deduplication**: Consolidate multiple comments on same issue into one task
- **CI verification**: Always check CI status after fixing review comments
- **Local reproduction**: Run tests/linters locally before pushing fixes
- **Reports as comments**: Post review reports as PR comments, never commit them
- **Clean commits**: Only commit actual code changes, not working/report files
