# Invoice Generation Skill

## Overview

Generate professional HTML invoices using pre-configured templates for hourly and subscription billing. Track client information, automatically increment invoice numbers, and maintain invoice history across all clients.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating a new invoice for an existing client by name
- Adding a new client to the invoice system
- Viewing client information or invoice history
- Generating invoices with work log entries (hourly) or subscription billing

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Generate Invoice for Existing Client

When the user requests an invoice for a client by name:

1. **Load client data** from `clients.json` to retrieve:
   - Client details and billing information
   - Invoice type (hourly or subscription)
   - Last invoice number for auto-increment

2. **For hourly invoices:**
   - Request work log entries from the user (they will paste as text)
   - Parse work log format: `Date - Project - Hours - Description`
   - For Versa Computing, parse: `Date - Project - Hours - Description` with separate Project and Description columns
   - Calculate total hours and amount (hours × hourly_rate)

3. **For subscription invoices:**
   - No work log needed
   - Use subscription_name and subscription_amount from client data

4. **Increment invoice number:**
   - New number = last_invoice_number + 1
   - Format: `{invoice_prefix}-2025-{new_number:03d}`

5. **Calculate dates:**
   - Invoice date: Use current date (check system date in environment)
   - Due date: Invoice date + payment_terms_days

6. **Load appropriate template:**
   - Hourly: `assets/hourly-invoice-template.html`
   - Subscription: `assets/subscription-invoice-template.html`

7. **Replace placeholders** with client data:
   - `{{INVOICE_NUMBER}}`, `{{INVOICE_DATE}}`, `{{DUE_DATE}}`
   - `{{CLIENT_NAME}}`, `{{CLIENT_ATTENTION}}`, `{{CLIENT_ADDRESS_LINE1}}`, `{{CLIENT_CITY_STATE_ZIP}}`
   - `{{PAYMENT_TERMS}}` (e.g., "30" for Net 30)
   - `{{PROJECT_REFERENCE}}` or `{{PO_NUMBER}}` as applicable
   - For hourly: `{{TOTAL_HOURS}}`, `{{HOURLY_RATE}}`, `{{SUBTOTAL}}`, `{{TOTAL_AMOUNT}}`
   - For subscription: `{{SUBSCRIPTION_NAME}}`, `{{BILLING_MONTH}}`, `{{AMOUNT}}`
   - Work log entries (populate table rows in HTML)

8. **Special handling for Versa Computing:**
   - Use 4-column work log table: DATE | PROJECT | DESCRIPTION | HOURS
   - Separate project name from description in work log entries
   - Project names go in the PROJECT column, descriptions in DESCRIPTION column

9. **Save invoice:**
   - Filename format: `Invoice-{invoice_number}-{short_name}-{month}-2025.html`
   - Location: User's Desktop (`/Users/arlenagreer/Desktop/`)

10. **Update clients.json:**
    - Set last_invoice_number to new number
    - Set last_invoice_date to invoice date
    - Save changes to maintain accurate history

### 2. Add New Client

To add a new client to the system:

1. Request necessary information:
   - Company name and contact details (attention, address)
   - Invoice type (hourly or subscription)
   - Invoice number prefix (3-letter abbreviation)
   - Billing rate (for hourly) or subscription amount
   - Payment terms in days
   - Special requirements (e.g., project column, PO number)

2. Add new client object to `clients.json` following the existing structure

3. Confirm client has been added successfully

### 3. View Client Information

To view or list clients:
- Read `clients.json` and display client details
- Show invoice history (last invoice number and date)
- List all tracked clients

## Client Database Structure

Client information is stored in `clients.json` in the skill folder. Each client entry includes:

**Required fields (all clients):**
- `name`: Full client name
- `short_name`: Abbreviated name for filenames
- `invoice_prefix`: 3-letter invoice number prefix
- `invoice_type`: "hourly" or "subscription"
- `company_name`: Company name for invoice
- `attention`: Contact attention line
- `address_line1`: Street address
- `city_state_zip`: City, state, and ZIP
- `last_invoice_number`: Last invoice number sent (integer)
- `last_invoice_date`: Date of last invoice (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `payment_terms_days`: Payment terms in days (e.g., 30 for Net 30)

**Hourly invoice fields:**
- `hourly_rate`: Billing rate per hour
- `project_reference`: Default project name
- `requires_project_column`: (optional) true if work log needs separate project column

**Subscription invoice fields:**
- `subscription_name`: Name of subscription service
- `subscription_amount`: Monthly subscription amount

### Current Clients

- **American Laboratory Trading** (INV prefix, hourly billing)
- **Empirico** (EMP prefix, subscription billing)
- **Versa Computing** (VER prefix, hourly billing with project column)

## Invoice Templates

### Hourly Invoice Template

Located at: `assets/hourly-invoice-template.html`

Features:
- Two-page layout: invoice summary (page 1) and detailed work log (page 2)
- Standard work log table: DATE | HOURS | DESCRIPTION
- For clients requiring project column: DATE | PROJECT | DESCRIPTION | HOURS
- Professional styling with Inter font and blue color scheme (#2563eb)
- Print-optimized CSS

Placeholders to replace:
- `{{INVOICE_NUMBER}}`, `{{INVOICE_DATE}}`, `{{DUE_DATE}}`
- `{{CLIENT_NAME}}`, `{{CLIENT_ATTENTION}}`, `{{CLIENT_ADDRESS_LINE1}}`, `{{CLIENT_CITY_STATE_ZIP}}`
- `{{PAYMENT_TERMS}}`, `{{PROJECT_REFERENCE}}`, `{{PO_NUMBER}}`
- `{{TOTAL_HOURS}}`, `{{HOURLY_RATE}}`, `{{SUBTOTAL}}`, `{{TOTAL_AMOUNT}}`
- Work log table rows (HTML tbody content)

### Subscription Invoice Template

Located at: `assets/subscription-invoice-template.html`

Features:
- Single-page layout
- Simplified line items table: Description and Amount only
- Same professional styling as hourly template

Placeholders to replace:
- `{{INVOICE_NUMBER}}`, `{{INVOICE_DATE}}`, `{{DUE_DATE}}`
- `{{CLIENT_NAME}}`, `{{CLIENT_ATTENTION}}`, `{{CLIENT_ADDRESS_LINE1}}`, `{{CLIENT_CITY_STATE_ZIP}}`
- `{{PAYMENT_TERMS}}`, `{{SUBSCRIPTION_NAME}}`, `{{PO_NUMBER}}`
- `{{BILLING_MONTH}}`, `{{AMOUNT}}`

## Workflow Example

**User:** "Generate an invoice for Versa Computing"

**Process:**
1. Read `clients.json` and locate Versa Computing client data
2. Determine invoice type: hourly (requires work log)
3. Prompt: "Please provide the work log entries for this invoice"
4. User pastes work log text
5. Parse entries, extracting: date, project, description, hours
6. Calculate totals: sum hours × hourly_rate
7. Increment invoice number: VER-2025-011 → VER-2025-012
8. Calculate dates: invoice_date (today), due_date (today + 30 days)
9. Load `assets/hourly-invoice-template.html`
10. For Versa, use 4-column work log table format
11. Replace all placeholders with client data and formatted work log entries
12. Save to: `/Users/arlenagreer/Desktop/Invoice-VER-2025-012-VersaComputing-Nov-2025.html`
13. Update `clients.json`: set last_invoice_number to 12, last_invoice_date to today
14. Confirm: "Invoice VER-2025-012 generated and saved to Desktop. Ready for review."

## Important Notes

- **Date handling:** Always check the system date in `<env>` context (Today's date)
- **Work log parsing:** Accept pasted text format, parse carefully to extract all components
- **Decimal hours:** Use decimal format (0.5, 1.0, 2.5) not time format
- **Invoice numbering:** Always auto-increment based on last_invoice_number
- **File location:** Save all invoices to `/Users/arlenagreer/Desktop/`
- **No email sending:** Skill only generates HTML files; user reviews and sends manually
- **Database updates:** Always update `clients.json` after successful invoice generation
- **Template format:** For Versa, modify table structure to include PROJECT column between DATE and DESCRIPTION
