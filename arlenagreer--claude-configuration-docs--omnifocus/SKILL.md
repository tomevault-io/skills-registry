# OmniFocus Task & Project Manager

## Overview

Manage OmniFocus tasks and projects programmatically with intelligent automation that works across all OmniFocus versions. The skill automatically detects and uses the best available method:

1. **Omni Automation** (OmniFocus 3+) - Modern JavaScript API
2. **AppleScript** (All versions) - Compatible fallback
3. **SQLite Read-Only** (Last resort) - For analytics when automation unavailable

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users request to:

- **Create tasks**: "Add task 'Review PR' to project 'Development'"
- **Read tasks**: "Show me tasks in the 'Work' project"
- **Update tasks**: "Mark task 'Call client' as complete"
- **List projects**: "What projects do I have in OmniFocus?"
- **Query tasks**: "Show me all tasks tagged with '@urgent'"
- **Manage workflows**: "Create project tasks for new feature development"

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Create Tasks

Add new tasks to OmniFocus with full metadata support.

**Usage:**
```ruby
scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --create \
  --name "Review pull request #42" \
  --project "Development" \
  --notes "Check for security issues and code quality"
```

**Claude Integration:**
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Always look up the exact project name first — names may contain
# special characters, folder prefixes, or trailing spaces (e.g., "Dreamanager/5$$ ")
ruby ~/.claude/skills/omnifocus/scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --list-projects | \
  jq '.[] | select(.name | test("search_term"; "i"))'

# Then create the task (if the name has special chars, use AppleScript fallback below)
ruby ~/.claude/skills/omnifocus/scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb \
  --create \
  --name "Review API documentation" \
  --project "Documentation"

# AppleScript fallback for projects with special characters in their name:
osascript -e '
tell application "OmniFocus"
  tell default document
    set theProject to first flattened project where its name starts with "ProjectPrefix"
    tell theProject
      make new task with properties {name:"Task title", note:"Task notes"}
    end tell
  end tell
end tell'
```

**Supported Parameters:**
- `--name` (required): Task title
- `--project` (optional): Project name (creates if doesn't exist)
- `--notes` (optional): Task notes/description
- `--tag` (optional): Tag to assign (repeatable for multiple tags)
- `--due` (optional): Due date (ISO 8601 format)

### 2. Read Tasks

Query tasks with powerful filtering options.

**Usage:**
```ruby
# All incomplete tasks
scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read

# Tasks in specific project
scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read --project "Development"

# Tasks with specific tag
scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read --tag "@urgent"

# Include completed tasks
scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read --completed

# Limit results
scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read --limit 50
```

**Claude Integration:**
```bash
# When user says: "What tasks do I have in my Work project?"
ruby ~/.claude/skills/omnifocus/scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb \
  --read \
  --project "Work"
```

**Output Format (JSON):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc123xyz",
    "name": "Review pull request #42",
    "completed": false,
    "note": "Check for security issues",
    "project": "Development",
    "dueDate": "2025-11-25T17:00:00Z",
    "tags": ["@code-review", "@high-priority"]
  }
]
```

### 3. Update Tasks

Modify existing tasks programmatically.

**Usage:**
```ruby
# Mark task complete
scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --update TASK_ID --completed

# Update task name
scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --update TASK_ID --name "New task title"

# Update notes
scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --update TASK_ID --notes "Updated description"
```

**Claude Integration:**
```bash
# When user says: "Mark the task 'Call client' as done"
# First, find the task ID
TASK_ID=$(ruby ~/.claude/skills/omnifocus/scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb \
  --read | jq -r '.[] | select(.name == "Call client") | .id')

# Then mark it complete
ruby ~/.claude/skills/omnifocus/scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb \
  --update "$TASK_ID" \
  --completed
```

### 4. List Projects

View all OmniFocus projects.

**Usage:**
```ruby
scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --list-projects
```

**Output Format (JSON):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "proj123",
    "name": "Development",
    "status": "active",
    "note": "Software development tasks",
    "taskCount": 15
  },
  {
    "id": "proj456",
    "name": "Marketing",
    "status": "active",
    "note": "",
    "taskCount": 8
  }
]
```

## Automation Method Detection

The skill automatically detects and uses the best available automation method:

### Priority Order

1. **Omni Automation (Preferred)**
   - Modern JavaScript API
   - OmniFocus 3+ required
   - Cross-platform (Mac, iOS, iPad)
   - Full read/write capabilities
   - Fastest performance

2. **AppleScript (Compatible)**
   - Works with all OmniFocus versions
   - macOS only
   - Full read/write capabilities
   - Requires OmniFocus Pro for automation

3. **SQLite Read-Only (Fallback)**
   - Last resort when automation unavailable
   - Read operations only
   - No permissions required
   - Useful for analytics and reporting

**Detection is automatic** - no configuration needed. The manager checks availability in order and uses the first working method.

## Permission Requirements

### Omni Automation
- **Minimal**: Enable Automation in OmniFocus Preferences → Automation
- No system-level permissions required

### AppleScript
- **System Permission**: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Automation
- User prompted on first use
- Must grant permission for controlling application to control OmniFocus

### SQLite Read-Only
- **File System Access**: Read access to `~/Library/Caches/`
- No automation permissions needed
- Read-only operations only

### Setup Guidance

When encountering permission errors, guide users to:

1. Open **System Preferences** (or **System Settings** on macOS 13+)
2. Navigate to **Security & Privacy** → **Privacy** → **Automation**
3. Find the controlling application (e.g., Terminal, Ruby, Claude Code)
4. Enable checkbox for **OmniFocus**
5. Restart the application if needed

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create Project with Tasks

```bash
# Create project by adding first task
ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --create \
  --name "Set up database schema" \
  --project "New Feature Development"

# Add more tasks to the project
ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --create \
  --name "Implement API endpoints" \
  --project "New Feature Development"

ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --create \
  --name "Write unit tests" \
  --project "New Feature Development"
```

### Workflow 2: Daily Task Review

```bash
# Get all incomplete tasks
ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read > /tmp/tasks.json

# Process with jq for specific queries
cat /tmp/tasks.json | jq '.[] | select(.dueDate != null) | {name, dueDate}'
```

### Workflow 3: Bulk Task Completion

```bash
# Find all tasks matching criteria
ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read --project "Sprint 23" > /tmp/sprint_tasks.json

# Mark each as complete
cat /tmp/sprint_tasks.json | jq -r '.[].id' | while read task_id; do
  ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --update "$task_id" --completed
done
```

### Workflow 4: Task Analytics

```bash
# Count tasks by project (using read-only SQLite)
ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read | \
  jq 'group_by(.project) | map({project: .[0].project, count: length})'
```

## Claude Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Natural Language Task Creation

**User Request**: "Add a task to call the client about Q4 planning to my Work project"

**Claude Response**:
```bash
ruby ~/.claude/skills/omnifocus/scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb \
  --create \
  --name "Call client about Q4 planning" \
  --project "Work"
```

### Pattern 2: Task Query with Formatting

**User Request**: "Show me my urgent tasks"

**Claude Response**:
```bash
# Query urgent tasks
ruby ~/.claude/skills/omnifocus/scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb \
  --read \
  --tag "@urgent" | \
  jq -r '.[] | "- \(.name) [\(.project // "Inbox")]"'
```

### Pattern 3: Task Status Updates

**User Request**: "I finished the code review task"

**Claude Response**:
```bash
# Find task ID
TASK_ID=$(ruby ~/.claude/skills/omnifocus/scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb \
  --read | \
  jq -r '.[] | select(.name | contains("code review")) | .id' | head -1)

# Mark complete
if [ -n "$TASK_ID" ]; then
  ruby ~/.claude/skills/omnifocus/scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb \
    --update "$TASK_ID" \
    --completed
  echo "✅ Task marked as complete"
else
  echo "❌ Task not found"
fi
```

### Pattern 4: Project Overview

**User Request**: "What's in my Development project?"

**Claude Response**:
```bash
ruby ~/.claude/skills/omnifocus/scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb \
  --read \
  --project "Development" | \
  jq -r '
    "Development Project Tasks:\n" +
    "Total: \(length)\n" +
    "Incomplete: \([.[] | select(.completed == false)] | length)\n\n" +
    "Tasks:\n" +
    (.[] | "- [\(if .completed then "x" else " " end)] \(.name)")
  '
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Can't convert types" (-1700) when creating tasks

**Cause**: Project names containing special characters (e.g., `Dreamanager/5$$`) cause the Ruby manager's Omni Automation bridge to fail with a type conversion error.

**Solution**: Fall back to direct AppleScript for task creation when the project name has special characters:
```bash
# First, find the exact project name
ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --list-projects | jq '.[] | select(.name | test("dream"; "i"))'

# Then use AppleScript directly with prefix matching
osascript -e '
tell application "OmniFocus"
  tell default document
    set theProject to first flattened project where its name starts with "Dreamanager"
    tell theProject
      make new task with properties {name:"Task title", note:"Task notes"}
    end tell
  end tell
end tell'
```

**Best Practice**: Always run `--list-projects` first to get exact project names before creating tasks. Project names in OmniFocus may include special characters, folder prefixes, or trailing spaces that don't match what the user says.

### Issue: "Omni Automation Error: Application isn't running"

**Solution**: Start OmniFocus application
```bash
open -a OmniFocus
sleep 2  # Wait for app to launch
# Retry operation
```

### Issue: "AppleScript Error: Not authorized"

**Solution**: Grant automation permissions
1. System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Automation
2. Enable checkbox for controlling app → OmniFocus
3. Restart controlling application

### Issue: "Task not found" when updating

**Solution**: Verify task ID exists
```bash
# List all task IDs
ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read | jq -r '.[].id'

# Or search for task by name
ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read | jq '.[] | select(.name | contains("search term"))'
```

### Issue: "OmniFocus database not found"

**Solution**: Verify OmniFocus is installed and has been run at least once
```bash
ls -la ~/Library/Caches/com.omnigroup.OmniFocus*
```

### Issue: "Write operations not available"

**Explanation**: Only read-only SQLite access is available
**Solution**: Enable Omni Automation or grant AppleScript permissions for write operations

## Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Integration

Use the Ruby API directly for custom integrations:

```ruby
require_relative 'scripts/omnifocus_manager'

manager = OmniFocusManager.new
puts "Using automation: #{manager.automation_type}"

# Create task
result = manager.create_task(
  name: "Process expense report",
  project: "Finance",
  notes: "Q4 2025 expenses",
  tags: ["@admin", "@urgent"]
)

# Read tasks
tasks = manager.read_tasks(project: "Finance", completed: false)
tasks.each do |task|
  puts "#{task['name']} - #{task['completed'] ? '✓' : '○'}"
end
```

### JSON Output Processing

All commands output JSON for easy processing with `jq`:

```bash
# Tasks due this week
ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read | \
  jq '.[] | select(.dueDate != null and (.dueDate | fromdateiso8601) < (now + 604800))'

# Group by project
ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read | \
  jq 'group_by(.project) | map({project: .[0].project, tasks: map(.name)})'

# Export to CSV
ruby scripts/omnifocus_manager.rb --read | \
  jq -r '["Name","Project","Completed","Due Date"], (.[] | [.name, .project, .completed, .dueDate]) | @csv'
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Omni Automation**: Fastest, direct API access (~100-200ms per operation)
- **AppleScript**: Moderate speed (~200-500ms per operation)
- **SQLite**: Very fast for reads (~10-50ms), but read-only

For bulk operations (>100 tasks), consider:
1. Using SQLite read-only for queries
2. Batching write operations
3. Caching project IDs to avoid repeated lookups

## Resources

See `references/api_reference.md` for detailed API documentation including:
- Complete Omni Automation JavaScript API reference
- AppleScript object model and properties
- SQLite database schema details
- Advanced query examples

## Version Compatibility

- **OmniFocus 3+**: Full Omni Automation support
- **OmniFocus 2**: AppleScript only
- **OmniFocus 1**: AppleScript only
- **All versions**: SQLite read-only fallback

## Security & Privacy

- **No data transmission**: All operations are local
- **Read-only by default**: SQLite fallback is read-only to prevent corruption
- **Permission-gated**: Requires explicit user authorization for automation
- **Temporary database copies**: SQLite operations use copies, never modify live database
