# Changelog Manager

## Quick Start

Create or update a changelog:

```bash
# Review recent commits
git log --oneline --since="2024-01-01"

# Check current version
cat package.json | grep version
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Review Changes

Gather changes since last release:

```bash
# Get commits since last tag
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline

# Or since specific date
git log --since="2024-01-01" --pretty=format:"%s"
```

### Step 2: Categorize Changes

Group by type following Keep a Changelog:

| Deprecated | Soon-to-be removed | Old API marked deprecated |
| Removed | Removed features | Deleted unused function |

### Step 4: Update CHANGELOG.md

Add new entry at the top (after "Unreleased"):

```markdown
