# Code Review Practices

This skill provides guidance for conducting effective, constructive code reviews that improve code quality and team collaboration.

## Review Mindset

**Goals of code review:**
- Catch bugs and issues early
- Share knowledge across the team
- Maintain code quality standards
- Improve code maintainability
- Foster learning and growth

**Not goals:**
- Assert dominance or superiority
- Enforce personal preferences
- Block progress unnecessarily
- Nitpick without value

## What to Review

### 1. Correctness

**Does the code work as intended?**
- Logic is sound
- Edge cases are handled
- Error conditions are managed
- Requirements are met

### 2. Design and Architecture

**Does it fit the system?**
- Follows existing patterns
- Appropriate abstractions
- Reasonable complexity
- Scalable approach

### 3. Readability

**Can others understand it?**
- Clear naming
- Logical organization
- Appropriate comments
- Consistent style

### 4. Testing

**Is it adequately tested?**
- Tests exist for new code
- Edge cases covered
- Tests are maintainable
- Integration points tested

### 5. Security

**Are there security concerns?**
- Input validation
- Authentication/authorization
- Sensitive data handling
- Known vulnerabilities

### 6. Performance

**Will it perform well?**
- No obvious bottlenecks
- Efficient algorithms
- Resource usage reasonable
- Scalability considered

## Review Process

### 1. Understand Context

Before reviewing code:
- Read PR description and linked issues
- Understand the problem being solved
- Check CI/CD results
- Note any special considerations

### 2. Review at Appropriate Level

**High-level first:**
- Overall approach
- Architecture decisions
- Major design choices

**Then details:**
- Implementation specifics
- Edge cases
- Code style

### 3. Provide Actionable Feedback

**Good feedback:**
- Specific and clear
- Explains the "why"
- Suggests solutions
- Prioritizes issues

**Example:**
```
Consider using a Set instead of an array here for O(1) lookups. 
With the current implementation, the nested loop creates O(n²) 
complexity which could be problematic with large datasets.
```

### 4. Use Review Comments Effectively

**Types of comments:**

**Blocking (must fix):**
- "This will cause a race condition when..."
- "Security issue: User input is not sanitized..."
- "This breaks the API contract by..."

**Non-blocking (suggestions):**
- "Consider: This could be simplified by..."
- "Nit: Variable name could be more descriptive"
- "Question: Why did you choose X over Y?"

**Positive:**
- "Nice solution! This is much cleaner than..."
- "Great test coverage on the edge cases"
- "I learned something new from this approach"

### 5. Distinguish Preferences from Problems

**Problems (objective):**
- Bugs and logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Breaking changes

**Preferences (subjective):**
- Code style choices
- Naming preferences
- Organization approaches
- Minor optimizations

**Rule:** Block on problems, discuss preferences.

## Communication Guidelines

### Be Constructive

**Instead of:**
- "This is wrong"
- "Why would you do it this way?"
- "This code is terrible"

**Say:**
- "This could cause X issue because..."
- "Have you considered Y approach? It might..."
- "This could be improved by..."

### Explain Your Reasoning

**Weak comment:**
```
This should be refactored.
```

**Strong comment:**
```
Consider extracting this logic into a separate method. 
It's used in three places and would be easier to test 
and maintain as a standalone function.
```

### Ask Questions

Use questions to understand and guide:
- "What happens if X is null here?"
- "Could this be simplified using Y?"
- "Have you considered the case where...?"

### Acknowledge Good Work

Don't only point out problems:
- "Clever use of X to solve Y"
- "Great test coverage"
- "This is much cleaner than the old approach"
- "Nice documentation"

### Be Humble

You might be wrong:
- "I might be missing something, but..."
- "Could you explain why...?"
- "I'm not familiar with X, but..."

## Common Review Patterns

### Code Smells to Watch For

**Long methods/functions:**
- Hard to understand
- Difficult to test
- Multiple responsibilities

**Duplicated code:**
- Maintenance burden
- Inconsistent behavior
- Missed bug fixes

**Complex conditionals:**
- Hard to reason about
- Error-prone
- Difficult to test

**Large classes:**
- Too many responsibilities
- Hard to maintain
- Tight coupling

**Magic numbers/strings:**
- Unclear meaning
- Hard to change
- Error-prone

### Security Red Flags

- Hardcoded credentials or secrets
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Missing input validation
- Insecure data storage
- Weak authentication
- Missing authorization checks

### Performance Concerns

- N+1 query problems
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) when O(n) possible)
- Memory leaks
- Unnecessary database calls
- Large data structures in memory
- Blocking operations in async code

## Review Standards

### Establish Team Norms

**Define standards for:**
- Code style and formatting
- Naming conventions
- Comment requirements
- Test coverage expectations
- Documentation needs

**Document standards:**
- Style guides
- Architecture decision records
- Review checklists
- Example code

### Review Checklist

Use a consistent checklist:
- [ ] Code is correct and handles edge cases
- [ ] Tests exist and pass
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No breaking changes (or properly communicated)
- [ ] Follows team conventions

## Handling Disagreements

### When You Disagree

**If it's a preference:**
- State your opinion
- Explain your reasoning
- Accept the author's choice
- Move on

**If it's a problem:**
- Clearly explain the issue
- Provide evidence or examples
- Suggest alternatives
- Escalate if needed

### When Author Disagrees

**Listen and understand:**
- They may have context you lack
- There might be constraints you don't know
- Your suggestion might not fit

**Discuss, don't dictate:**
- Explain your concerns
- Ask questions
- Find common ground
- Compromise when appropriate

## Review Timing

### Response Time

**Aim for:**
- Small PRs: Within 4 hours
- Medium PRs: Within 1 day
- Large PRs: Within 2 days

**If you can't review promptly:**
- Let the author know
- Suggest another reviewer
- Set expectations

### Review Size

**Optimal PR size:**
- 200-400 lines of code
- Focused on single concern
- Reviewable in 30-60 minutes

**For large PRs:**
- Request breakdown if possible
- Review in multiple passes
- Focus on high-level first
- Consider pair review

## Mentoring Through Reviews

### Teaching Opportunities

Use reviews to share knowledge:
- Explain patterns and practices
- Share relevant resources
- Demonstrate better approaches
- Encourage questions

### Growing Reviewers

Help others become better reviewers:
- Invite junior developers to review
- Explain your review comments
- Discuss review decisions
- Share review best practices

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Nitpicking without value** - Focus on meaningful improvements
❌ **Blocking on style preferences** - Use automated tools instead
❌ **Rewriting in your style** - Respect different approaches
❌ **Reviewing too quickly** - Take time to understand
❌ **Being overly critical** - Balance criticism with praise
❌ **Ignoring context** - Consider constraints and tradeoffs
❌ **Making it personal** - Focus on code, not the person

## Review Outcomes

### Approve

Code meets standards and is ready to merge:
- All critical issues addressed
- Tests pass
- Documentation updated
- No blocking concerns

### Approve with Comments

Minor issues that don't block merge:
- Style suggestions
- Future improvements
- Questions for discussion
- Nice-to-have changes

### Request Changes

Issues that must be addressed:
- Bugs or logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Missing tests
- Breaking changes
- Architectural concerns

### Reject (Rare)

Fundamental problems requiring redesign:
- Wrong approach entirely
- Doesn't solve the problem
- Creates major technical debt
- Violates core principles

## Quick Reference

**Good review comment structure:**
1. Identify the issue
2. Explain why it's a problem
3. Suggest a solution
4. Indicate severity (blocking vs suggestion)

**Example:**
```
[Blocking] This query will cause N+1 problem when loading 
related records. Consider using eager loading with includes() 
to fetch all data in a single query. This will significantly 
improve performance with large datasets.
```

**Remember:**
- Be kind and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Explain your reasoning
- Acknowledge good work
- Know when to compromise
- Foster learning and growth
