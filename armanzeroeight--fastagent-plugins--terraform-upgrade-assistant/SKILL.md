# Terraform Upgrade Assistant

This skill helps safely upgrade Terraform and provider versions.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Upgrading Terraform CLI version
- Updating provider versions
- Fixing deprecated syntax warnings
- Migrating to new provider features
- Preparing for major version upgrades

## Upgrade Process

### 1. Check Current Versions

```bash
# Check Terraform version
terraform version

# Check provider versions in use
terraform providers

# Check for available updates
terraform init -upgrade
```

### 2. Review Upgrade Guides

Before upgrading, review:
- [Terraform Upgrade Guides](https://www.terraform.io/language/upgrade-guides)
- Provider changelog (e.g., AWS provider releases)
- Breaking changes documentation

### 3. Upgrade Strategy

**Incremental approach (recommended):**
1. Upgrade one minor version at a time
2. Test thoroughly between upgrades
3. Fix deprecation warnings before major upgrades

**Example path:** 1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 → 1.5

### 4. Update Version Constraints

```hcl
# Before
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
  
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

# After
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5"
  
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## Handling Deprecation Warnings

### Identify Warnings

```bash
# Run plan to see warnings
terraform plan

# Example output:
# Warning: Argument is deprecated
#   Use aws_s3_bucket_acl resource instead
```

## Upgrade Checklist

### Pre-Upgrade
- [ ] Backup state file
- [ ] Review upgrade guides for target version
- [ ] Check provider changelogs
- [ ] Test in non-production environment first
- [ ] Ensure team is aware of upgrade

### During Upgrade
- [ ] Update version constraints in code
- [ ] Run `terraform init -upgrade`
- [ ] Run `terraform plan` and review changes
- [ ] Fix any deprecation warnings
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines with new version

### Post-Upgrade
- [ ] Run `terraform plan` (should show no changes)
- [ ] Test apply in dev environment
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Commit version constraint changes
- [ ] Monitor for issues

## Troubleshooting

### State File Compatibility

```bash
# If state file is incompatible with provider source
terraform state replace-provider \
  registry.terraform.io/-/aws \
  registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws
```

### Provider Plugin Issues

```bash
# Clear provider cache and reinitialize
rm -rf .terraform/
rm .terraform.lock.hcl
terraform init -upgrade
```

## Version Constraint Best Practices

```hcl
# Good - Allows patch updates, prevents breaking changes
terraform {
  required_version = "~> 1.5.0"  # 1.5.x only
  
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"  # 5.x only
    }
  }
}

# Too restrictive
required_version = "= 1.5.0"  # Only exact version

# Too permissive
required_version = ">= 1.0"  # Could break on major updates
```
