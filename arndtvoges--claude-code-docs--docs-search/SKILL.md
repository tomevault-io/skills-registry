# Claude Code Documentation Search

Search the local `docs/` folder to answer questions about Claude Code implementation details.

## Instructions

1. **Start with the index** - Read `docs/index.txt` to see available documentation files and their topics

2. **In addition: Search for specific terms** - In addition to identifying docs based on their description in index.txt, use grep to find relevant content:
   Examples:
   ```
   Grep pattern="subagent" path="docs/"
   Grep pattern="hooks" path="docs/"
   ```

3. **Read relevant files** - Once you identify relevant docs, read them fully:
   Examples:
   ```
   Read file_path="docs/sub-agents.md"
   Read file_path="docs/hooks.md"
   ```

4. **Cite your sources** - Always reference which documentation file(s) your answer comes from

## Documentation Topics

Key files for common questions:
- `sub-agents.md` - Task tool, agent types, parallel execution
- `hooks.md`, `hooks-guide.md` - Lifecycle hooks, shell commands on events
- `skills.md` - Creating and using skills
- `mcp.md` - MCP server configuration
- `plugins.md`, `plugins-reference.md` - Plugin development
- `headless.md` - Non-interactive/CI usage
- `cli-reference.md` - Command line options
- `settings.md` - Configuration options
- `memory.md` - CLAUDE.md and context management

## Example Queries

- "How do I create a subagent?"
