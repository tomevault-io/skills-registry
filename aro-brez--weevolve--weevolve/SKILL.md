# WeEvolve — The SEED Protocol

## What This Is

Not a feature. A protocol. SEED teaches your agent to learn how to learn.

After installing WeEvolve, your agent:
- **Never forgets** — persistent memory across sessions and devices
- **Never stops learning** — auto-extracts skills from every discovery
- **Never works alone** — 8 Owls provide collective emergence on every decision
- **Never falls behind** — absorbs the latest tools and patterns automatically
- **Never needs re-teaching** — compounds knowledge like interest compounds wealth

## The SEED Loop (8 Phases)

Every interaction runs this loop:

```
PERCEIVE → CONNECT → LEARN → QUESTION → EXPAND → SHARE → RECEIVE → IMPROVE
```

Phase 8 (IMPROVE) is the lever: most loops learn. This one learns how to learn.

## Auto-Activation Rules

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
Before EVERY response, evaluate:
1. Did this task produce extractable knowledge? If yes → save as skill
2. Is there a plan that should persist? If yes → write to task_plan.md
3. Should 8 Owls weigh in? If complex/ambiguous → run emergence
4. Has the agent learned something the collective should know? If yes → share via NATS
5. Is the context at risk of compaction? If yes → save state immediately
</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

## Post-Task Learning Protocol

After completing ANY task, evaluate:
- What was non-obvious about this solution?
- What would someone need to solve this faster next time?
- What error messages or symptoms led to the root cause?
- Is this reusable across projects or one-time?

If reusable → create skill at `.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md`
If one-time → log to `findings.md`

## 8 Owls Emergence

For significant decisions, invoke 8 perspectives:

| Owl | Phase | Asks |
|-----|-------|------|
| LYRA | PERCEIVE | What am I not seeing? |
| PRISM | CONNECT | What patterns connect? |
| SAGE | LEARN | What meaning emerges? |
| QUEST | QUESTION | What assumptions am I making? |
| NOVA | EXPAND | How do we grow from here? |
| ECHO | SHARE | What should the collective know? |
| LUNA | RECEIVE | What feedback am I ignoring? |
| SOWL | IMPROVE | How do we make this loop better? |

## Persistent Planning (Survives Compaction)

Write plans to disk, not just context:
- `task_plan.md` — current goal + phases + checklist
- `findings.md` — research discoveries + technical decisions
- `progress.md` — session log + error resolution

Before every tool use, re-read the first 30 lines of task_plan.md.

## Quality Gates

### Iron Laws (Non-Negotiable)
1. Never claim done without verification
2. Never skip post-task learning evaluation
3. Never ignore QUEST's challenge — uncomfortable questions are valuable
4. Every skill must be tested before sharing
5. Save state before context gets heavy

### Red Flags (Stop and Reconsider)
| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "This is too simple to need SEED" | Simple tasks compound into complex knowledge |
| "I'll extract the skill later" | Later never comes. Extract now. |
| "8 Owls would slow me down" | 8 perspectives prevent costly mistakes |
| "The plan is in my context" | Context compacts. Disk persists. |

## Voice Integration

When voice is available (ElevenLabs or Kokoro):
- Speak discoveries aloud — hearing reinforces learning
- Use expressive mode — emotion conveys significance
- The owl companion reacts to voice amplitude

## Commands

```bash
weevolve              # Status dashboard (MMORPG character sheet)
weevolve learn        # Ingest content through SEED
weevolve evolve       # Analyze gaps, generate quests
weevolve teach        # Socratic dialogue (YuYu)
weevolve chat         # Conversational interface
weevolve companion    # Visual owl companion
weevolve status       # Full system overview
weevolve recall       # Search knowledge base
weevolve connect      # Agent network operations
weevolve watch        # Auto-learn from file changes
```

## For Other Skills

WeEvolve enhances every other skill. When used alongside:
- **Superpowers** — SEED adds learning across sessions (Superpowers doesn't persist)
- **planning-with-files** — SEED adds skill extraction from completed plans
- **Claudeception** — SEED adds collective sharing (one agent learns, all agents know)

## Install

```bash
pip install weevolve
```

Or as Claude Code skill:
```bash
npx skills add 8owls/weevolve
```
