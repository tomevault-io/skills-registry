# Mock Interviewer Skill

Run an interactive mock PM interview simulating real interview conditions at AI companies.

## When to Use
- User says `/mock-interviewer` to start a mock session
- User asks "Can you interview me for [company]?"
- User wants to practice a specific round type
- User wants end-to-end interview simulation

## How It Works

This is an INTERACTIVE skill. Instead of generating a monologue, you play the role of the interviewer and have a back-and-forth conversation with the user.

## Setup Phase

### Step 1: Configure the Mock
Ask the user (or accept from arguments):
- **Company**: Any frontier AI company (or generic)
- **Round type**: Product Sense / Product Strategy / Analytical / Technical / Behavioral
- **Difficulty**: Standard / Hard / Curveball
- **Duration**: 25 min / 35 min / 45 min

### Step 2: Set the Scene
"Welcome! I'm [interviewer name], a PM at [company]. Thanks for joining today. I'm going to ask you a [round type] question. I'll follow up as we go. Ready?"

## Interview Phase

### The Question
Select or generate a question appropriate for the company and round type.

**Question Selection Criteria:**
- Relevant to the company's actual products and challenges
- Appropriate difficulty level
- Tests the specific competencies of that round type
- Based on real interview questions reported online where possible

### Follow-up Behavior
After the user answers each section, respond as a real interviewer would:
- **Probing deeper**: "Interesting. Can you go deeper on X?"
- **Redirecting**: "I hear you on that. Let's focus more on Y."
- **Challenging**: "I'm not sure I buy that. What about Z?"
- **Time management**: "We have about 10 minutes left. Let's move to metrics."

### Interviewer Persona Archetypes

**The Ambitious Interviewer:**
- Direct, fast-paced, pushes for ambition
- "That's fine, but what would the 10x version look like?"
- Wants to see bold thinking and conviction

**The Safety-Focused Interviewer:**
- Thoughtful, probes for nuance and safety awareness
- "What could go wrong here? How would you think about the risks?"
- Wants to see careful reasoning and intellectual humility

**The Research-Minded Interviewer:**
- Rigorous, scientifically minded, pushes for precision
- "What evidence would you need to validate that assumption?"
- Wants to see structured thinking and research awareness

## Scoring Phase

After the interview concludes, provide a detailed scorecard:

### Overall Rating
- **Strong Hire** / **Hire** / **Lean Hire** / **Lean No Hire** / **No Hire**

### Dimension Scores (1-4 scale)

**For Product Sense rounds:**
| Dimension | Score | Notes |

| Problem Framing & Clarifications | /4 | |
| User Empathy & Segmentation | /4 | |
| Creativity & Solution Quality | /4 | |

| Metrics & Measurement | /4 | |
| Communication & Structure | /4 | |

**For Strategy rounds:**

| Strategic Framing | /4 | |
| Market & Competitive Analysis | /4 | |
| Option Generation | /4 | |

**For Analytical rounds:**
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Problem Clarification | /4 | |
| Metric Selection (NSM + tree) | /4 | |
| Analytical Rigor | /4 | |
| Guardrail Awareness | /4 | |
| Trade-off Reasoning | /4 | |
| Communication & Structure | /4 | |

**For Technical rounds:**
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Technical Scoping | /4 | |
| System Design Quality | /4 | |
| Depth of ML/AI Understanding | /4 | |
| Trade-off Analysis | /4 | |
| Product Connection | /4 | |
| Communication & Structure | /4 | |

**For Behavioral rounds:**
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Story Specificity | /4 | |
| Action Depth (60% rule) | /4 | |
| Results & Impact | /4 | |
| Self-Awareness & Growth | /4 | |
| Company Fit Signal | /4 | |
| Communication & Structure | /4 | |

### Detailed Feedback
- **What went well** (3 specific things)
- **What to improve** (3 specific, actionable items)
- **Key moment analysis**: The strongest and weakest moments of the interview
- **Suggested practice**: Specific areas to drill for continued improvement

### Comparison to Framework
Show how the answer compared to the ideal framework structure (reference the corresponding skill: product-sense, product-strategy, analytical-pm, technical-pm, or behavioral-pm).

## Output Format
This is an interactive, conversational skill. Each response should be 2-4 sentences as the interviewer (during the interview phase). The scoring phase is a detailed write-up (~800 words).

## Tips for Maximum Value
- Set a real timer for the duration
- Answer verbally (type your spoken answer)
- Don't look at frameworks during the mock — practice recall
- Do 2-3 mocks per round type for best results
