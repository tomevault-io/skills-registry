# Claude Code Meta

Create any Claude Code extension component. This skill routes to specific builders based on what you need.

## What Are You Building?

| Component | When to Use | Command |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Skill** | Extend Claude with specialized knowledge, workflows, tool integrations | `/build-skill` |
| **Hook** | Automated validation, context injection, workflow automation | `/build-hook` |
| **Plugin** | Bundle skills/hooks/commands for distribution | `/build-plugin` |
| **Marketplace** | Distribute plugins (local, GitHub, git) | `/build-marketplace` |
| **Slash Command** | User-invoked `/command` prompts | `/build-command` |

## Quick Decision Guide

**"I want to add knowledge/workflows to Claude"** → Skill

**"I want automated task execution"** → Agent (invokes Skills for guidance)

**"I want to validate/inject context automatically"** → Hook

**"I want to bundle and distribute extensions"** → Plugin + Marketplace

**"I want a quick user-typed command"** → Slash Command

## Component Relationships

```
Plugin (distribution package)
├── Skills (knowledge bases)
├── Agents (task executors that use Skills)
├── Hooks (automation triggers)
└── Commands (user-invoked prompts)

Marketplace (distributes Plugins)
```

**Key insight**: Agents are executors, Skills are knowledge. An agent invokes a skill for guidance, then executes.

## Usage

1. Identify what you're building from table above
2. Read the corresponding reference file
3. Follow the patterns and examples there
4. For official Anthropic docs, use `claude-code-docs-reference` skill

## Builder Commands

This plugin includes commands that can create components deterministically:

- `/build-skill` - Creates skills with proper structure and patterns
- `/build-hook` - Creates hooks for automation
- `/build-plugin` - Creates plugins for distribution
- `/build-marketplace` - Creates marketplaces for plugin distribution
- `/build-command` - Creates slash commands

Invoke with: `/command-name [details about what to build]`
