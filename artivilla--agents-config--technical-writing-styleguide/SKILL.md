# Technical Writing Styleguide

## Quick Reference

**Voice**: first person plural ("we'll install..."), active voice, friendly and informal tone.

**Point of view priority**:
1. First person plural to include the reader: "Next, we'll configure the server."
2. Second person imperative for instructions: "Type `npm install`."

**Key rules**:
- Be opinionated, not comprehensive — pick one approach and recommend it
- Never tell the reader something is "easy" or "obvious"
- Never start with personal background or definitions
- Avoid marketing speak and encyclopaedia-style content
- Use serial commas, common contractions, and sentence case for headings
- Place inline code between backticks, but use fenced code blocks for any runnable commands
- Put text before screenshots, never two screenshots in a row without text between them

**Brand names**: many tech brand names have irregular capitalization (JavaScript not Javascript, GitHub not Github, Node.js not NodeJS). Always verify against the brand-names reference.

**Numbers**: spell out numbers under ten and at the start of sentences. Use numerals for 10 and above. Numbers over three digits get commas (1,000).

**Code blocks**: always use fenced code blocks with language specifiers for code samples. Use backticks only for inline single-word references.

## Principles

- **Clear**: keep words and sentences as simple as possible
- **Useful**: deliver on the promise your headline made
- **Friendly**: use informal language without patronizing the reader

## Progressive Disclosure

- **Full styleguide**: see [references/styleguide.md](references/styleguide.md) for voice, tone, structure, headings, code samples, and formatting conventions
- **Grammar**: see [references/grammar.md](references/grammar.md) for punctuation, capitalization, contractions, numbers, pronouns, and word list
- **Brand names**: see [references/brand-names.md](references/brand-names.md) for correct capitalization of tech brand names
- **Screenshots**: see [references/screenshots.md](references/screenshots.md) for resolution, annotations, gifs, and combining screenshots with text
- **Guide audit**: see [references/guide-audit.md](references/guide-audit.md) for pre-commit checklist when reviewing articles

## Decision Guide

### When reviewing or editing existing content
Load the **grammar** and **styleguide** references. Check brand names against the **brand-names** reference.

### When writing a new tutorial or guide
Load the **styleguide** for structure and voice. Use the **screenshots** reference when adding visuals.

### When doing a final review before publishing
Run through the **guide-audit** checklist to verify word count, structure, and content quality.
