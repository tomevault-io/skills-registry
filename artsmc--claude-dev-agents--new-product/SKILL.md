# New Product - Deep Research & Architecture Design

Given documentation or a product description, perform deep research and cross-reference technologies to determine the optimal architecture for building a new application.

## Your Task

You are orchestrating a deep research workflow to design product architecture. Follow these stages in order, using parallel agents for deep research, and present a final comprehensive review at the end.

---

## Stage 0: Initialize Product Workspace

**Parse input argument:**
- If the input is a file path (contains `/` or ends in `.md`, `.txt`, etc.), read the documentation
- If the input is plain text, treat it as a product description

**Extract product name:**
- From documentation: look for project title, product name
- From description: derive a short kebab-case name (e.g., "real-time chat app" → "realtime-chat")

**Create folder structure:**
```bash
mkdir -p /job-queue/product-{name}/research-notes
```

**Output:**
- Display: "🚀 Stage 0/6: Workspace created at /job-queue/product-{name}/"
- Store the product name for use in later stages

---

## Stage 1: Big Idea & High-Level Research

**Goal:** Generate a comprehensive high-level understanding of the product and initial technology landscape.

### Step 1.1: Analyze Input

**If documentation provided:**
- Read all provided files
- Extract key concepts: features, user flows, requirements
- Identify technical hints or constraints mentioned

**If product description provided:**
- Parse the description for:
  - Core functionality
  - Target users
  - Key features
  - Scale expectations

### Step 1.2: Ask Initial Clarifying Questions

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather essential context:

**Questions to ask:**

   - Header: "Vision"
   - Question: "What is the primary goal of this product?"
   - Options:
     - "Solve a specific problem for users" - "Focus on targeted pain points"
     - "Innovate in an existing space" - "Bring new approach to established market"
     - "Integrate multiple services" - "Connect disparate systems"
     - "Explore new technology" - "Research/experimental project"

2. **Scale & Audience**
   - Header: "Scale"
   - Question: "What scale are you targeting?"
   - Options:
     - "Prototype/MVP (100s of users)" - "Proof of concept"
     - "Small-Medium (1,000s of users)" - "Early stage product"
     - "Medium-Large (100,000s of users)" - "Established product"
     - "Enterprise scale (1M+ users)" - "High-scale production"

3. **Deployment Context**
   - Header: "Deployment"
   - Question: "Where will this product run?"
   - Options:
     - "Cloud-hosted (AWS/GCP/Azure)" - "Managed infrastructure"
     - "Self-hosted/On-prem" - "Customer infrastructure"
     - "Edge/Distributed" - "CDN, edge compute"
     - "Hybrid" - "Mix of cloud and local"

### Step 1.3: High-Level Technology Research

Use `WebSearch` to research broad technology landscape:

**Search queries:**
- "[product type] architecture patterns 2026"
- "[product type] technology stack comparison 2026"
- "[product type] best practices 2026"
- "[scale level] architecture considerations 2026"

**For each search result:**
- Use `WebFetch` to read top 2-3 articles
- Extract: common patterns, recommended technologies, pitfalls to avoid

**Save research notes:**
```bash
Write to: /job-queue/product-{name}/research-notes/stage1-research.md
```

### Step 1.4: Generate big-idea.md

**Content structure:**

Next Steps:
  1. Review detailed architecture docs in /job-queue/product-{name}/
  2. Approve or request revisions
  3. Begin implementation

```

**Ask for feedback:**

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question**: "Would you like to revise any architectural decisions?"
- **Options**:
  - "Approve - looks good" - "Proceed with this architecture"
  - "Revise runtime execution" - "Re-research execution model"
  - "Revise abstraction layer" - "Re-research abstraction approach"
  - "Revise integration layer" - "Re-research integrations"
  - "Revise output rendering" - "Re-research rendering strategy"

**If user approves:**
- Display: "✅ Architecture approved! Ready for implementation."

**If user requests revision:**
- Re-run the specific stage's research agent with feedback
- Regenerate that document
- Re-present for approval

## Error Handling

**At any stage failure:**

1. Display which stage failed
2. Show what was completed
3. Provide recovery instructions

**Example:**
```
❌ Research Failed at Stage 3/6: Abstraction Layer

Completed:
  ✓ [Stage 0] Workspace created
  ✓ [Stage 1] Big idea generated
  ✓ [Stage 2] Runtime execution researched
  ✗ [Stage 3] Abstraction layer FAILED

Error: [error message]

Partial work saved at: /job-queue/product-{name}/

Recovery:
  - Fix the issue and resume with: /new-product [input]
  - Or manually continue research
```

---

## Tools Used

- **WebSearch** - Technology research and comparisons
- **WebFetch** - Reading official documentation
- **Task Tool** - Parallel research agents
- **AskUserQuestion** - Iterative clarification
- **Read/Write** - Document generation

---

## Expected Outcomes

After completion:

1. ✅ Comprehensive architecture research
2. ✅ 5 detailed architecture documents
3. ✅ Technology stack recommendations
4. ✅ Trade-offs and risks identified
5. ✅ User approval obtained
6. ✅ Ready for implementation

---

## Notes

- **Deep research**: Use WebSearch + WebFetch extensively
- **Parallel execution**: Launch all 4 document agents at once
- **Iterative questions**: Ask questions during each stage, not all upfront
- **Cross-referencing**: Each agent reads big-idea.md for context
- **Documentation quality**: Comprehensive, well-structured, actionable

---

**Total Expected Duration:**

- Stage 0: ~10 seconds (folder creation)
- Stage 1: ~5-10 minutes (high-level research + big-idea.md)
- Stages 2-5: ~15-25 minutes (parallel deep research for 4 docs)
- Stage 6: ~2-3 minutes (summary generation + review)

**Total: ~20-40 minutes** (depending on research depth and user interaction speed)
