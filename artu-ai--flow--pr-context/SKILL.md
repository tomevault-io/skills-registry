# PR Context

This skill retrieves the current pull request's details to provide context about the PR state.

## When to Use

- When you need to check CI/build status
- When the user asks about "the PR", "pull request", or "checks"
- When you need to see review comments or requested changes
- When checking if PR is ready to merge
- When the user asks "what's the PR status?" or "did CI pass?"

## Fetching PR Details

### Basic PR Information

Get PR details for current branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json title,body,state,isDraft,url,number,headRefName,baseRefName,mergeable,reviewDecision,additions,deletions,changedFiles
```

This returns:

- **title**: PR title
- **body**: PR description
- **state**: OPEN, CLOSED, or MERGED
- **isDraft**: Whether it's a draft PR
- **url**: PR URL
- **reviewDecision**: APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUESTED, REVIEW_REQUIRED, or null
- **mergeable**: Whether it can be merged
- **additions/deletions**: Lines changed
- **changedFiles**: Number of files changed

### CI/Check Status

Get status of all checks:

```bash
gh pr checks
```

This shows:

- Check name
- Status (pass, fail, pending)
- Duration
- Link to details

### Review Comments

Get review comments if needed:

```bash
gh pr view --json reviews --jq '.reviews[] | {author: .author.login, state: .state, body: .body}'
```

## Providing Context

### For status overview:

```
