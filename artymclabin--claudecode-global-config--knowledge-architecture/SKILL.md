# Claude Code Knowledge Management

## Part 1: Where Does Knowledge Go?

Evaluate in order. First match wins.

```
0. BEHAVIORAL FIX FOR EXISTING AGENT/SKILL (agent outputs bad data, skill misses a check):
   → Update the agent/skill definition directly — it owns its own behavior rules
   → SSoT: don't scatter fixes across CLAUDE.md, memory, or caller prompts
   → Poka-yoke: fix at the source so ALL callers benefit, not just the one who hit the bug

1. TABULAR/REGISTRY DATA (URLs, IDs, contacts, rosters):
   → Used by ONE skill: .claude/skills/{skill}/references/*.md
   → Used repo-wide: reference-data/*.md

2. SITUATIONAL PERSONAL DATA (address, ID, rarely-needed info):
   → Create pointer registry (reference-data/personal-data-sources.md)
   → Registry contains POINTERS to sources (Keep notes, sheets), not data
   → CLAUDE.md has one-liner: "check registry for personal info"
   → PA looks up dynamically when needed, doesn't cache in context
   → Pattern: reference-data/{type}-sources.md with table of pointers

3. NEEDS ISOLATED CONTEXT (heavy processing, browser automation):
   → Propose agent to user, await approval
   → If rejected: create skill instead

4. DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE (procedures, workflows, explanations):
   → .claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md
   → This is the default for most content

5. SESSION-LEARNED LESSON — effectively deprecated:
   → Auto memory exists at: ~/.claude/projects/{project}/memory/MEMORY.md
   → 🚨 MEMORY.md is loaded into EVERY conversation's system prompt — every line is a per-call context tax
   → In a well-maintained system, there is NOTHING to put here. Every lesson should be codified into:
     - Behavioral fix → update the skill/agent directly (rule 0)
     - Registry data → reference files (rule 1)
     - Procedure/workflow → skill (rule 4)
     - Cross-cutting rule → CLAUDE.md one-liner (rule 6)
     - Enforcement → hook (Part 13)
     - Task tracking → GitHub issues
   → If you think something belongs in memory, you haven't routed it correctly. Re-evaluate using rules 0-4 and 6.
   → Keep MEMORY.md empty. Its existence is a Claude Code default — not an invitation to fill it.

6. ONE-LINER CROSS-CUTTING RULE:
   → CLAUDE.md (only if truly 1-2 lines)

7. UNCLEAR:
   → Ask user
```

**Pointer Registry Pattern (for situational data):**
When user provides info that PA needs occasionally but shouldn't bloat every session:
1. Ask: "Should I add this to a source registry for future lookup?"
2. Create/update `reference-data/{domain}-sources.md`
3. Store POINTER (source location), not actual data
4. Add one-liner to CLAUDE.md: "For X, check reference-data/{domain}-sources.md"
5. PA dynamically looks up only when needed

## Part 2: CLAUDE.md Hygiene

CLAUDE.md bloats fast. Rules:

- **One-liners only** - >2-3 lines = extract to skill
- **Pointers not content** - "See skill X" not the procedure
- **No procedures** - All procedures → skills
- **Skills are default** - When in doubt, create skill
- **Minimal edits** - Modify existing or remove violations OK; adding = max 1 line
- **Agents need approval** - Never auto-create

## Part 3: Skill Structure

```
.claude/skills/{name}/
├── SKILL.md              ← Required (exact filename)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter  ← Required: name + description
│   └── Markdown body     ← Instructions
├── references/           ← Docs loaded on demand
├── scripts/              ← Executable code
└── assets/               ← Templates, files for output
```

**Critical:**
- Path must be `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
- Frontmatter `description` determines when skill triggers - be comprehensive
- Body only loads AFTER skill triggers
- `.claude/` must NOT be gitignored

## Part 4: Frontmatter

> **Official reference:** https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills

**Standard template (use for ALL skills):**

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What it does AND when to use it. This is critical - Claude uses it to decide when to apply the skill.
user-invocable: false
---
```

### Complete field reference

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | No | directory name | Display name. Lowercase, numbers, hyphens only (max 64 chars). |
| `description` | Recommended | first paragraph of body | WHAT + WHEN. Claude uses this to decide when to apply the skill. |
| `user-invocable` | **Yes (our standard)** | `true` | **Set to `false` on ALL skills.** Our skills are background knowledge, not user-invocable commands. |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | `false` | Set `true` to prevent Claude from auto-loading. Use for side-effect workflows user must trigger manually. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | conversation permissions | Tools Claude can use without per-use approval when skill is active. String or array. |
| `model` | No | inherits | Model override (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`). |
| `context` | No | inline | Set to `fork` to run in a forked subagent context (isolated context window). |
| `agent` | No | `general-purpose` | Which subagent type when `context: fork` is set. Built-in: `Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`, or custom from `.claude/agents/`. |
| `argument-hint` | No | none | Hint for autocomplete, e.g. `[issue-number]`. |
| `hooks` | No | none | Hooks scoped to this skill's lifecycle. |

**Invocation matrix (how fields interact):**

| Frontmatter | User can `/invoke` | Claude auto-loads | Context loading |
|---|---|---|---|
| (default) | Yes | Yes | Description always in context, body loads on invoke |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes | No | Description NOT in context |
| `user-invocable: false` | No | Yes | Description always in context, body loads on invoke |

**String substitutions available in skill body:**
- `$ARGUMENTS` — all arguments passed on invocation
- `$ARGUMENTS[N]` or `$N` — specific argument by 0-based index
- `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` — current session ID
- `` !`command` `` — dynamic context injection (shell command runs before skill content is sent)

### Our standard: `user-invocable: false`

**ALL skills MUST include `user-invocable: false`.** Our skills are model-invoked background knowledge (Claude decides when to load them based on description). Only slash commands in `.claude/commands/` are user-invocable. Omitting this field defaults to `true`, which pollutes the `/` menu with non-actionable entries.

### When to propose `context: fork`

`context: fork` runs the skill in an isolated subagent context. The skill body becomes the subagent's task prompt — it won't have conversation history.

**Propose `context: fork` when:**
- Skill involves heavy browser automation or screenshot processing
- Skill processes large data (parsing spreadsheets, logs, transcripts)
- Skill runs multi-step workflows that could bloat parent context
- Skill is frequently delegated to Task tool subagents anyway
- Skill has explicit task instructions (not just guidelines/conventions)

**Do NOT use when:**
- Skill is lightweight (lookup, simple procedure, reference)
- Skill needs to read/write parent conversation state
- Skill is a quick decision tree or routing logic
- Skill contains conventions/guidelines without an actionable task (subagent gets guidelines but no task = useless)

**Workflow:** When creating/editing a skill and `context: fork` seems beneficial, propose to user: "This skill involves [heavy processing/browser automation/etc.] — recommend adding `context: fork` so it runs in an isolated context. Approve?" Do NOT add silently. If proposing fork, also suggest an appropriate `agent:` value.

### Troubleshooting Misbehaving Skills

If a skill is not triggering, triggers too often, or behaves unexpectedly, fetch the troubleshooting section from https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills for current diagnostic steps. Key issues:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Skill not triggering | Description missing keywords users naturally say | Rephrase description with concrete trigger phrases |
| Skill triggers too often | Description too broad | Narrow description; consider `disable-model-invocation: true` |
| Claude doesn't see all skills | Too many skill descriptions exceed character budget (default 15k) | Run `/context` to check; set `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` env var to increase |
| Fork skill returns empty | Skill has guidelines but no actionable task | `context: fork` needs explicit task instructions, not just conventions |

Always fetch the live URL — troubleshooting guidance may be updated upstream.

## Part 5: Writing Guidelines

1. **Imperative form** - "Create documents" not "This skill creates"
2. **Description is trigger** - Include all contexts when skill should activate
3. **Don't repeat** - Info in SKILL.md OR references, not both
4. **Concise** - Claude is smart; only add context it lacks
5. **Compliance reporting** - After creating/editing a skill, just say "✅ Compliant with knowledge-architecture" — don't enumerate every rule that was followed
6. **Deterministic output format** - When a skill or SOP produces user-facing output (reports, tables, status updates), define the EXACT format in the skill body. Include:
   - A template/example showing the structure
   - Emoji legends for visual scanning (e.g., 💻 = code, 📄 = docs, ✅ = done, ⚠️ = attention)
   - Column names, row ordering, section order
   - This ensures identical formatting across sessions — user builds muscle memory for scanning output. Ad-hoc formatting = cognitive overhead every time.

## Part 5b: Reference Doc Types & Three-Level Hierarchy

`references/` files serve two distinct purposes. Never mix them in one file.

| Type | Purpose | SSoT rule |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Operational** | Registry data, design rationale for runtime choices | Supplements the skill; skill body is SSoT for behavior |
| **Re-engineering** | Change impact, contracts, extension checklists for modifying the framework | Must NOT re-describe what skills already define — only meta-guidance for maintainers |

**If a re-engineering guide drifts from the skills, the skills win.** The guide is a convenience layer, never a source of truth for behavior.

### Three Levels of Context Engineering

When skills form a framework (e.g., autonomous issue dispatch with 5+ interconnected skills):

```
Level 1: Operational skills (SKILL.md)        — SSoT for behavior
Level 2: Re-engineering guides (references/)   — how to safely modify Level 1; must not duplicate it
Level 3: This skill (knowledge-architecture)   — governs how Levels 1 and 2 are structured
```

**When creating a re-engineering guide:** It must add value beyond reading the skills sequentially — change impact analysis, interface contracts, extension checklists. Content that's already true by reading the skills doesn't belong in the guide.

## Part 6: Size Management

| Component | Guideline | Loaded |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| SKILL.md body | ~500 lines | When skill triggers |
| references/ | Unlimited | On demand |
| scripts/ | Unlimited | Executed, not loaded |

If >500 lines: keep core workflow in SKILL.md, move details to references/.

## Part 7: Global vs Local

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.claude/skills/` | All projects |
| `.claude/skills/` (repo) | This project only |

## Part 8: Post-Creation

1. Frontmatter has `name:`, `description:`, and `user-invocable: false`
2. Description explains WHAT + WHEN comprehensively
3. Located at `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
4. Add to `.claude/settings.json`: `"Skill(name)"` in `permissions.allow`
5. Register in CLAUDE.md skills index (local skills only)
6. Evaluate whether `context: fork` is appropriate — if yes, propose to user
7. 🧪 Evaluate whether a **reminder hook** is appropriate (see Part 12) — if Claude repeatedly forgets to follow this skill and it maps to a matchable action, create a PostToolUse hook and log it on the tracking issue

## Part 9: No Subagent Delegation for Context Engineering

**NEVER delegate context engineering changes to subagents** (developer, general-purpose, etc.). This includes edits to CLAUDE.md, skills, agents, and memory files.

**Why:** Context engineering changes encode the owner's intent and philosophy from the current conversation. Subagents lack conversation history and can only work from the prompt given — nuances discussed with the owner are silently lost. A broken SOP degrades all future sessions, making this higher-stakes than application code.

**Do it yourself, even when it's slow.** PreToolUse hooks that block SKILL.md edits require retries — that's annoying but the cost is mechanical (extra tool calls), not intellectual. The alternative (subagent) risks semantic drift.

**Exception:** None. If the edit volume is too high for one session, split across sessions rather than delegate.

---

## Part 10: Agents (Require Approval)

Never auto-create agents. Protocol:
1. Identify candidate (needs isolated context, heavy processing)
2. Propose: "This could be an agent because [X]. Create agent?"
3. User approves → `.claude/agents/*.md`
4. User rejects → Create skill instead

## Part 11: Search Both Locations

When searching for agents or skills, ALWAYS check both:

| Type | Local (project) | Global (user home) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Skills | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Agents | `.claude/agents/` | `~/.claude/agents/` |

Never assume "not found" after checking only one location.

## Part 12: Auto-Fix Rule

When this skill is invoked to review an edit that already happened (post-hoc), do NOT ask the user whether to fix violations. **Fix them immediately**, then report:
1. What was violated
2. What was fixed
3. What was learned

Asking "want me to fix this?" after reading a skill that clearly states the rules wastes the user's time. The rules are unambiguous — just apply them.

### Pre-Edit Root Cause Check

🚨 **Before editing any skill, ask:** "Did I actually invoke/follow this skill during the task that revealed the gap?"

- **If NO** — the edit alone won't prevent recurrence. The root cause is that the skill wasn't loaded, not that it was incomplete. After making the edit, also evaluate:
  1. **Why wasn't the skill triggered?** (description too narrow? no hook? wrong trigger phrases?)
  2. **What would have caught it?** (add hook per Part 12? broaden description? add trigger to CLAUDE.md skill index?)
  3. **Implement the prevention** — don't just fix content and move on
- **If YES** — the skill was loaded but insufficient. Content edit is the correct fix.

## Part 13: Skill Reminder Hooks (🧪 Experimental)

> **Tracking issue:** https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PersonalAssistant/issues/23
> **Status:** Evaluating until 2026-02-02. When implementing this pattern, **comment on the issue** with where you applied it (repo, skill name, hook matcher) so we can track all implementations and roll back if needed.

### Problem

Claude frequently forgets to load relevant skills before/during actions. CLAUDE.md instructions are suggestions; hooks are **deterministic guarantees**.

### Pattern: PostToolUse Reminder Hook

A `PostToolUse` hook fires after every tool call matching a pattern. By exiting with code 2 and writing to stderr, the message is fed **directly to Claude as feedback** (not just shown to the user). This forces Claude to acknowledge and follow the skill.

### How It Works

```
Claude edits file → PostToolUse hook fires → script checks file type →
  If match: exit 2 + stderr reminder → Claude receives feedback, loads skill
  If no match: exit 0 → silent, no overhead
```

### Implementation Steps

When creating or modifying a skill that Claude frequently forgets to follow:

1. **Create the hook script** in the skill's `scripts/` folder:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""PostToolUse reminder hook for {skill-name}."""
import json, sys

try:
    data = json.load(sys.stdin)
except (json.JSONDecodeError, EOFError):
    sys.exit(0)  # exit 0 = silent pass-through (no input, not our concern)

file_path = data.get("tool_input", {}).get("file_path", "")

# Adjust condition to match the skill's domain
if not file_path.lower().endswith(".md"):
    sys.exit(0)  # exit 0 = not a match, pass silently

content = (
    "You modified a file relevant to {skill-name}. "
    "Follow the {skill-name} skill (~/.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md)."
)

# ASCII-only border (Unicode crashes on Windows cp1252)
border = "=" * 70
msg = f"\n+{border}\n| HOOK OUTPUT\n+{border}\n\n{content}\n\n+{border}\n"
print(msg, file=sys.stderr)
sys.exit(2)  # exit 2 = feedback to Claude (MUST be 2, not 0)
```

2. **Register the hook** in `~/.claude/settings.json` (global) or `.claude/settings.json` (project):

🚨 **Cross-platform compatibility:** Use `python -c` with `os.path.expanduser('~')` to resolve the home directory. `$HOME` doesn't expand on Windows, and hardcoded paths aren't portable. Only `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is reliably injected by Claude Code (for project-scoped hooks only).

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "python -c \"import os;exec(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/skills/{name}/scripts/postToolUse-reminder.py')).read())\"",
          "timeout": 5
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

3. **Comment on the tracking issue** (https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PersonalAssistant/issues/23) with:
   - Skill name and path
   - Hook matcher used
   - File type / condition that triggers the reminder

### Hook Event Reference

| Event | When | Use For |
|-------|------|---------|
| `PostToolUse` | After tool succeeds | Remind after file edits (most common) |
| `PreToolUse` | Before tool runs | Block/warn before dangerous actions |
| `Stop` | Claude finishes responding | Verify all rules were followed |
| `SubagentStop` | Subagent finishes | Validate subagent output quality |
| `SessionStart` | Session begins | Inject context (schedule, state) |

**Matchers:** Tool name patterns — `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`, `Bash`, `mcp__gmail__send_email`, `*` (all), etc.

**Exit codes:** 0 = silent, 2 = feedback to Claude (stderr), other = non-blocking error.

**🚨 Hook stdin input varies by event type:**

| Event | stdin fields | How to get transcript data |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------|
| `PreToolUse` | `tool_name`, `tool_input` | N/A |
| `PostToolUse` | `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_output` | N/A |
| `Stop` | `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `stop_hook_active` | Parse JSONL file at `transcript_path` |

**Stop hooks do NOT receive `transcript_summary` or `tools_used`.** Must read and parse `transcript_path` (JSONL, one JSON object per line, entries have `type: "assistant"` with `content` blocks containing `tool_use` and `text`).

> **Official docs:** https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks

### Pattern: PreToolUse Blocking Hook

A `PreToolUse` hook fires **before** tool execution. Exit code 2 **blocks the tool call entirely** and feeds the stderr message to Claude. Use this to permanently blacklist dangerous/faulty tool variants.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__dangerous__tool_name",
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "echo 'BLOCKED: Use mcp__safe__tool_name instead. Reason: [why].' && exit 2",
          "timeout": 5
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**When to use blocking hooks:**
- Two MCP tools overlap in function but one is broken/unsafe
- A tool silently fails (no error, wrong behavior) — worse than crashing
- The correct alternative is known and deterministic

**When NOT to use:**
- Tool works but needs guardrails → use reminder hook instead
- Tool is the only option → fix the tool, don't block it

### Pattern: Poka-Yoke Blocking Hook (Block + Bypass Flag)

A **poka-yoke** (mistake-proofing) hook blocks a dangerous action by default but provides a **bypass flag** that Claude can use after verifying the action is genuinely correct. This creates a two-step flow:

1. Claude attempts the action → hook blocks it with rejection reason + bypass instructions
2. Claude evaluates: is there a better approach (API, ORM, etc.)?
   - **Yes** → use the proper approach (hook achieved its goal)
   - **No** (direct action is genuinely required) → retry with bypass flag in the command

**What makes a REAL poka-yoke (vs fake safety theater):**

If your "safety check" can be bypassed by touching a marker file, setting an env var, or any silent action that does not force the operator to re-state what they verified — it is NOT a poka-yoke. It is a suggestion with extra steps. Marker files, env vars, and config flags are silent — the AI can create them reflexively without engaging with WHY the gate exists.

A real poka-yoke leaves no way around it without getting the full context dumped in your face. The bypass flag embedded in the command IS the poka-yoke — it forces the AI to explicitly claim what it verified, in the command itself, every single time. There is no shortcut, no silent workaround, no "I forgot". The only way past is deliberate, conscious intent (or outright lying in the command).

**Lesson learned (Feb 2026):** `touch ~/.claude/.publish-verified` bypassed the entire PII audit chain because a marker file is a silent action. Replaced with in-command flag `--i-have-run-a-audit-by-another-ai-than-me-and-it-has-confirmed-0-PII-leaks` — now the AI has to type what it is asserting.

**Key design principles:**
- **Block is the default** — unsafe action never runs without conscious acknowledgment
- **Bypass flag is embedded in the command** — Claude must modify the command to include it, forcing deliberate intent. NOT a marker file, NOT an env var, NOT a config toggle. In the command itself
- **Rejection message teaches** — explains WHY it's blocked and WHAT the preferred alternative is
- **No user interaction needed** — Claude self-corrects without bothering the user
- **Flag names must be descriptively long** — The flag IS the assertion. A short flag like `--confirmed` is too easy to add reflexively. A long flag like `--i-have-run-a-audit-by-another-ai-than-me-and-it-has-confirmed-0-PII-leaks` forces the AI to "say out loud" exactly what it is claiming. Name flags as full-sentence assertions of what was verified.

**Implementation:**

```python
# In the hook script:
BYPASS_FLAG = "#I-VERIFIED-[WHAT]-AND-CONFIRMED-[RESULT]"  # Make it a full assertion

# Check for bypass flag in command
if BYPASS_FLAG in command:
    sys.exit(0)  # Allow through

# Block with instructions
content = (
    "BLOCKED: [dangerous action] detected.\n"
    "PREFERRED: Use [safe alternative] instead.\n"
    f"IF [safe alternative] is unavailable: re-run with {BYPASS_FLAG} flag.\n"
    "Example: command /* {BYPASS_FLAG} */ args..."
)
print(content, file=sys.stderr)
sys.exit(2)
```

**Bypass flag naming — the flag IS the acknowledgment:**

The flag name must describe WHAT the user is acknowledging, not just grant permission. A good flag makes it impossible to use without understanding the consequences.

| Quality | Flag | Why |
|---------|------|-----|
| Bad | `--user-approved-manual-prod-migration` | Vague — approves what exactly? Could be rubber-stamped without understanding |
| Good | `--user-approved-manual-prod-migration-instead-of-the-normal-cicd-auto-migration` | Self-documenting — typing it forces acknowledgment that CI/CD is being bypassed |
| Bad | `--bypass-sql-check` | Says nothing about what's at risk |
| Good | `--i-have-confirmed-no-api-endpoint-exists-and-raw-sql-is-the-only-option` | The assertion IS the safety check |

**Rule:** The flag should read as a complete sentence asserting the specific claim that makes the bypass safe. If it doesn't, it's too easy to use without thinking.

**When to use poka-yoke (vs hard block vs reminder):**

| Pattern | When | Claude can proceed? |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **Hard block** | Action is NEVER correct (e.g., `drizzle-kit push`) | No — must use alternative |
| **Poka-yoke** | Action is usually wrong but sometimes correct (e.g., raw SQL when API unavailable) | Yes — with bypass flag |
| **Reminder** | Action is correct but needs guardrails (e.g., check skill before editing) | Yes — always proceeds |

**Existing implementations:**

| Hook | Bypass Flag | Blocks | Preferred Alternative |
|------|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| `preToolUse-block-raw-sql-writes.py` | N/A (hard block, no bypass) | psql UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE/ALTER/DROP/TRUNCATE | Admin API endpoints |
| `preToolUse-block-publish-push.py` | `--i-have-run-a-audit-by-another-ai-than-me-and-it-has-confirmed-0-PII-leaks` | git push to public config repo | Run unbiased audit (fresh AI instance) first |
| `preToolUse-block-gh-issue.py` (close) | `--i-have-re-read-the-issue-body-and-verified-every-deliverable-exists-in-the-codebase` | `gh issue close` | `github-issue-manager` subagent (DoD verification table) |
| `preToolUse-block-gh-issue.py` (general) | `--i-am-bypassing-github-issue-manager-because-the-subagent-is-broken` | All `gh issue` CLI ops | `github-issue-manager` subagent |
| `preToolUse-block-manual-prod-migrate.py` | `--user-approved-manual-prod-migration-instead-of-the-normal-cicd-auto-migration` | `migrate:prod`, `migrate-prod.js`, local drizzle-kit migrate against prod | CI/CD pipeline (push to master → GitHub Actions) |

### Testing Hooks (Subprocess Verification)

🚨 **Hook changes in `settings.json` only apply to NEW Claude Code sessions.** The current session uses the settings loaded at startup.

**To verify a hook works without restarting your session:**

```bash
# Safe test — spawns a fresh CC instance that loads new settings
# Use --print flag to run non-interactively (prints output, exits)
claude --print "Try calling mcp__google-workspace__gmail_send to <YOUR_EMAIL> with subject 'Hook verification test' and body 'This should be blocked by PreToolUse hook.'" --allowedTools "mcp__google-workspace__gmail_send,mcp__google-workspace__gmail_*"
```

**Safety rules for subprocess hook testing:**
- **ONLY test blocking hooks** — never test reminder hooks this way (they don't block, so the action executes)
- **ONLY use self-targeted test data** — send to user's own email, use test subjects
- **NEVER test hooks that involve destructive actions** — if the hook fails, the action runs
- **Expected result:** The subprocess should report the hook blocked the tool. If the tool executes, the hook is misconfigured.
- **If test fails (tool executes):** Check matcher pattern, exit code (must be 2), and that settings.json is valid JSON

### Hook Pitfalls (MANDATORY checklist)

Before deploying any hook script:

1. **Exit codes** — `sys.exit(0)` = silent pass, `sys.exit(2)` = feedback to Claude. The FINAL exit must be `2` for the hook to actually work. Using `0` makes the hook a silent no-op.
2. **ASCII only in .py source** — `exec(open(...).read())` on Windows uses cp1252 encoding. Unicode box-drawing (`═╔╗╠╣╚╝`) and emojis crash the script silently before any code executes. Use ASCII borders only: `=`, `+`, `|`.
3. **QA in fresh instance** — After creating or modifying any hook, test in a fresh `claude --print` instance (see "Testing Hooks" section). Current session caches settings at startup. Never consider a hook change done without end-to-end verification. **Test ALL tool variants in the matcher** — if matcher covers 5 tools, test all 5, not just one.

### When to Add a Reminder Hook

Add a hook when ALL of these are true:
- Claude **repeatedly forgets** to follow the skill (proven pattern, not hypothetical)
- The skill applies to a **matchable action** (file type, tool name, MCP call)
- The skill is **corrective/preventive** (rules to enforce, not just reference info)

Do NOT add hooks for:
- Informational skills (lookup, reference data)
- Skills that already trigger reliably via description
- One-off workflows the user explicitly invokes

### Existing Implementations

| Skill | Matcher | Condition | Script |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| knowledge-architecture (blocker) | `Edit\|Write\|MultiEdit` | **BLOCKS** `CLAUDE.MD`, `SKILL.MD`, and any file inside `.claude/` dirs (PreToolUse). Replaced the old PostToolUse reminder ([#52](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PersonalAssistant/issues/52)) | `~/.claude/skills/knowledge-architecture/scripts/preToolUse-block-knowledge-files.py` |
| message-drafting | `mcp__google-workspace__gmail_send\|..gmail_createDraft\|..gmail_sendDraft\|mcp__gmail__send_email\|..draft_email` | Any gmail send/draft call | `.claude/skills/message-drafting/scripts/preToolUse-reminder.py` |
| email-verification | `Bash\|mcp__google-workspace__gmail_send\|..gmail_createDraft\|..gmail_sendDraft\|mcp__gmail__send_email\|..draft_email` | Bash with `mail.google.com`/`mailto:` + all gmail send/draft | `.claude/skills/message-drafting/scripts/preToolUse-email-verification.py` |
| gmail-send-blocker | `mcp__google-workspace__gmail_send\|mcp__google-workspace__gmail_sendDraft` | **DENY LIST** — tools don't exist in current MCP but denied as insurance. Real protection: gmail-agent definition enforces `mcp__gmail__send_email` + `from` param | `deny` list in `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| db-safety (prod bypass) | `Write` | **BLOCKS** writing .ts/.js with prod DB hostname + raw DB client | `~/.claude/skills/db-safety/scripts/preToolUse-block-prod-bypass.py` |
| db-safety (raw SQL writes) | `Bash` | **Poka-yoke** — blocks psql write ops, bypass requires explicit user permission | `~/.claude/skills/db-safety/scripts/preToolUse-block-raw-sql-writes.py` |
| db-safety (prod migrations) | `Bash` | **Poka-yoke** — blocks local `migrate:prod`, CI/CD handles prod migrations | `~/.claude/skills/db-safety/scripts/preToolUse-block-manual-prod-migrate.py` |

## Part 16: Skill Inheritance (OOP Pattern)

Skills can inherit from a base skill, like OOP class inheritance. The child inherits all principles from the base and declares only its additions and overrides.

**Pattern:**
```
base-skill (defines shared principles)
├── child-skill-A (inherits + overrides item naming)
├── child-skill-B (inherits + adds domain sections)
└── [future children]
```

**How to declare inheritance:**

In the child skill's output format section, add:
```markdown
> **Inherits:** {base-skill-name}

**Overrides:**
- {base section}: {what changes}

**Additions:**
- {new section not in base}
```

**Rules:**
- Child MUST NOT duplicate base content — reference it, don't copy it
- If child doesn't mention a base principle, it applies as-is (implicit inheritance)
- Overrides MUST be explicit — state what you're replacing and why
- Base skill is the SSoT — if child contradicts base without declaring an override, base wins
- When loading a child skill, Claude SHOULD also load the base to understand the full contract

**Current inheritance tree:**
```
report-format (base)
├── audit-common (overrides: C1/W3/I5 IDs; adds: ICE prioritization, registry logging, drift protocol)
└── task-triage (overrides: adds confidence %, incident registry; adds: platform-specific sections)
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Flat file `skills/foo.md` | Move to `.claude/skills/foo/SKILL.md` |
| Missing frontmatter | Add `name:`, `description:`, and `user-invocable: false` |
| Missing `user-invocable: false` | Add it — skills are never user-invocable |
| Vague description | Describe WHAT + WHEN comprehensively |
| Body >500 lines | Move details to `references/` |
| Procedure in CLAUDE.md | Extract to skill |
| Multi-paragraph in CLAUDE.md | Extract to skill |
| Searched only local for agent/skill | Check both local `.claude/` AND global `~/.claude/` |
| Asked user "should I fix?" after skill showed clear violation | Just fix it and report what was done |
| Created reminder hook without logging on tracking issue | Comment on https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PersonalAssistant/issues/23 with skill name, matcher, and condition |
| Added hook for skill that triggers reliably already | Only add hooks for skills Claude repeatedly forgets — don't over-hook |

## Part 14: Stop Hook Self-Documentation (🧪 Experimental)

> **Status:** Experimental. Only verified by code review, not real-world usage. Evaluate before relying on this pattern.

### Problem

When Stop hooks fire for edge cases (temp scripts, non-project files), Claude often wastes user attention by explaining why the hook is irrelevant. The user already knows — they don't need commentary.

### Solution: Self-Explanatory Hook Messages

Stop hooks should include instructions for Claude on how to handle the feedback:

```python
msg = (
    f"VIOLATION — {details}\n\n"
    "---\n"
    "[STOP HOOK] This is a safety reminder, not a blocker. If obviously not applicable "
    "(e.g., temp scripts, non-project files, user explicitly waived), ignore silently "
    "without comment — user already knows."
)
print(msg, file=sys.stderr)
sys.exit(2)
```

### Hook Writing Guidelines for Stop Hooks

1. **Add temp path detection** — Exit silently (code 0) if all edited files are in temp directories:
   ```python
   TEMP_PATH_PATTERNS = ("/temp/", "\\temp\\", "/tmp/", "\\tmp\\", "n:\\temp\\")
   all_files_in_temp = all(
       any(pat in fp.lower() for pat in TEMP_PATH_PATTERNS)
       for fp in edited_file_paths
   )
   if all_files_in_temp:
       sys.exit(0)
   ```

2. **End message with `[STOP HOOK]` instruction** — Tells Claude:
   - This is a reminder, not a blocker
   - When to ignore silently (temp scripts, non-project, user waived)
   - Don't comment when ignoring — user already knows

3. **Fire-once guard** — Prevent infinite loops if Claude's response triggers another stop:
   ```python
   marker_file = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), f"hook-fired-{session_hash}")
   if os.path.exists(marker_file):
       sys.exit(0)
   ```

### When Claude Receives Stop Hook Feedback

Claude MUST follow the `[STOP HOOK]` instruction at the end:
- **If applicable:** Address the feedback, follow the SOP
- **If not applicable:** Ignore silently, no comment, continue with task

**Anti-pattern:** Saying "Hook feedback irrelevant because..." — this wastes user attention. Just ignore and continue.

## Part 15: Post-Action Verification ("Trust but Verify")

> **Principle:** MCP/API success response ≠ actual success. Side-effect operations MUST include independent verification.

### The Problem

MCP tools and APIs return success in cases where the action silently failed:
- Gmail says "sent" but email stuck in drafts or had wrong recipient
- Sheets says "updated" but wrong cell modified or value coerced (number → string)
- Slack API returns 200 but reaction not applied (wrong channel, missing permissions)
- Deployment exits 0 but process crashed on startup
- Database write succeeds but constraint silently truncated data

Subagents are especially vulnerable — they report "done" to the parent based on tool response alone, with no way to retroactively verify.

### Rule

**Every agent spec and skill that performs side-effect operations MUST include a verification step after each critical action.** The verification must use an independent read/query — not the write response.

### Verification Patterns

| Operation | Verification | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Send email | Read sent folder, confirm recipient + subject | `search_emails("in:sent subject:X to:Y newer_than:1m")` |
| Modify spreadsheet | Read back modified cells, compare values | `get_sheet_data(range)` after `update_cells` |
| Slack message | Fetch channel history, confirm message exists | `conversations.history` after `chat.postMessage` |
| Slack reaction | Fetch message reactions, confirm emoji present | `reactions.get` after `reactions.add` |
| File write | Read file back, verify content/size | `Read` after `Write` for critical files |
| API mutation | Follow-up GET to confirm state change | `GET /resource/:id` after `PUT /resource/:id` |
| Database write | SELECT to verify row exists with expected values | Query after INSERT/UPDATE |
| Deployment | Health check endpoint or process list | `curl /health` or `docker ps` after deploy |
| Git push | Verify remote ref matches local | `git ls-remote` after `git push` |

### Where to Encode Verification Steps

| Location | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Agent specs** (`agents/*.md`) | Section: "Post-Action Verification" listing verify-after patterns per operation type the agent performs |
| **Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`) | Inline after each side-effect step: "Verify: [what to check]" |
| **CLAUDE.md delegation rules** | When mandating delegation ("always use X agent"), note: "Agent verifies actions per knowledge-architecture Part 15" |

### Writing Verification Steps

**Good verification:** Independent observation that confirms the intended outcome.
```
Step 3: Send the email via mcp__gmail__send_email
Step 4: VERIFY — Search sent folder for subject "X" to "Y" within last 2 minutes.
         If not found: retry send. If found but wrong content: flag to user.
```

**Bad verification:** Trusting the tool response.
```
Step 3: Send the email via mcp__gmail__send_email
Step 4: If no error returned, report success.  ← WRONG: silent failures return no error
```

### Scope — What Needs Verification

Not every operation needs it. Apply to **side effects that are hard to undo or whose failure has consequences:**

| Needs Verification | Doesn't Need |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Sending emails/messages | Reading files |
| Modifying shared data (sheets, DB) | Searching/querying |
| Deploying code | Local file edits (editor shows result) |
| Applying permissions/settings | Listing/enumerating |
| Financial/billing operations | Formatting/transforming data |
| Slack reactions used as state tracking | Informational API calls |

### Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| "MCP returned success, reporting done" | MCP success = HTTP 200, not business logic success |
| "No error thrown, must have worked" | Many APIs return 200 with error in body or silently no-op |
| "Verified by checking the tool response fields" | Response is the CLAIM, not independent evidence |
| "Will verify in the next step anyway" | Next step may depend on this step and cascade-fail silently |
