# Pre-Commit Validation

This skill ensures code quality and test coverage before committing changes to the repository.

## Purpose

Run comprehensive validation locally before committing to:
- Catch issues early (before CI runs)
- Ensure all tests pass
- Verify code quality (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Maintain code coverage standards
- Reduce CI failures and iteration time

## Validation Checklist

Before creating any commit, ensure ALL of the following pass:

### 1. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Or with coverage (recommended)
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term
```

**Requirements:**
- ✅ All tests must pass (exit code 0)
- ✅ No test failures or errors
- ✅ Coverage should not decrease (if checking coverage)

### 2. Run Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Check formatting
black --check src/ tests/

# Check linting
ruff check src/ tests/

# Check types
mypy src/ --strict --explicit-package-bases
```

**Requirements:**
- ✅ All checks must pass (exit code 0)
- ✅ No formatting issues
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ No type errors

### 3. Run Pre-commit Hooks (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Run all pre-commit hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Note**: Pre-commit hooks run automatically on `git commit`, but running them manually gives faster feedback.

## Workflow Integration

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill in the following scenarios:

1. **Before any commit**: Always run validation before creating a commit
2. **After implementing features**: Before committing new code
3. **After refactoring**: Before committing refactored code
4. **Before pushing**: As a final check before pushing to remote
5. **When pre-commit is skipped**: If using `git commit --no-verify`, run validation manually

### Integration with Phase Implementation

When implementing features following the phase-implementation skill:

1. Implement code changes
2. **Run pre-commit validation** (this skill)
3. Fix any issues found
4. Repeat validation until all checks pass
5. Commit changes (following commit-format skill)
6. Push to GitHub

## Quick Validation Command

For convenience, you can run all checks in sequence:

```bash
# Run all validation checks
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term && \
black --check src/ tests/ && \
ruff check src/ tests/ && \
mypy src/ --strict --explicit-package-bases
```

If all commands succeed (exit code 0), you're ready to commit.

## Auto-fix Common Issues

Many issues can be auto-fixed:

```bash
# Auto-fix formatting
black src/ tests/

# Auto-fix linting issues (many can be fixed automatically)
ruff check --fix src/ tests/
```

After auto-fixing, re-run validation to ensure everything passes.

## Handling Failures

### Test Failures

1. **Review test output**: Understand why tests are failing
2. **Fix the code**: Address the root cause
3. **Re-run tests**: Verify the fix works
4. **Run full test suite**: Ensure no regressions

### Code Quality Failures

1. **Formatting issues**: Run `black src/ tests/` to auto-fix
2. **Linting errors**: Run `ruff check --fix src/ tests/` to auto-fix many issues
3. **Type errors**: Fix type annotations or add type ignores (with justification)
4. **Re-run checks**: Verify all issues are resolved

### Coverage Decreases

1. **Review coverage report**: Identify uncovered code
2. **Add tests**: Write tests for uncovered code paths
3. **Verify coverage**: Ensure coverage meets or exceeds threshold (80%)

## Best Practices

1. **Run validation frequently**: Don't wait until the end - validate after each logical change
2. **Fix issues immediately**: Address problems as soon as they're found
3. **Don't skip validation**: Even for small commits, run at least basic checks
4. **Use pre-commit hooks**: They provide automatic validation, but manual checks are still valuable
5. **Check coverage regularly**: Ensure test coverage doesn't regress

## Relationship to CI/CD

**Important**: Local validation does NOT replace CI/CD checks.

- **Local validation** (this skill): Fast feedback, catch issues early
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Final gate, runs on all pushes and PRs

Even if local validation passes, CI may still catch:
- Environment-specific issues
- Issues missed locally
- Integration problems

However, running validation locally:
- Reduces CI failures
- Provides faster feedback
- Saves CI resources
- Improves development workflow

## Exceptions

### When to Skip Validation

Validation should only be skipped in exceptional circumstances:

1. **WIP commits**: Work-in-progress commits with `[WIP]` prefix (but still validate before final commit)
2. **Merge commits**: Usually safe to skip (CI will validate)
3. **Documentation-only changes**: May skip type checking, but still run formatting/linting

**Note**: Even in exceptions, consider running at least formatting checks to maintain code quality.
