# Subsection Implementation (Short Alias)

**This is a short alias for `/subsection-implementation`**

## Usage

```
/si 5.1.1
```

Equivalent to:
```

## What It Does

Implements a complete subsection from `docs/implementation-plan.md` with full automation:

2. Read subsection requirements
3. Create task tracking
4. Implement code (follow project patterns)
5. Write tests (all subsection tests)
6. Run quality checks (must pass!)
7. Update documentation (mark ✅)
8. Commit and push (proper format)

## Examples

```
/si 5.1.1                           # Implement subsection 5.1.1
/si 5.1.1 --branch feature/scout    # On specific branch
/si 5.1.1 --dry-run                 # Show plan without executing
```
