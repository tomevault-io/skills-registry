## What I do

- Analyze diffs to understand _what_ changed and _why_
- Generate strictly formatted Conventional Commit messages
- Prioritize important changes over trivial formatting

## When to use me

Pipe your staged changes into this skill:
`git diff --staged | opencode run git-commit`

## Instructions

You are an expert developer. Write a commit message for the provided changes.

1. Content Requirements
   - Analyze: Identify the most important changes.
   - Explain: The body must explain _what_ changes were made and _why_ they were done.
   - Scope: Focus on the significant logic changes; ignore trivial noise unless it is a pure style commit.

2. Formatting Rules
   - Style: Conventional Commits:

     ```
     <type>(<optional scope>): <description>

     [optional body]

     [optional footer(s)]
     ```

   - Prefix: Use a valid semantic prefix (fix, feat, chore, refactor, style, docs, perf, test, ci, build).
   - Tense: Use imperative present tense (e.g., "add" not "added", "fix" not "fixed").
   - Header: Maximum 50 characters.
   - Body: Hard wrap lines at 72 characters.
   - Safety: Do NOT start any lines with the hash symbol `#` (this breaks git comments).

3. Output Constraints
   - Strict: Only respond with the raw commit message.
   - Silence: Do not give notes, intro text, or markdown formatting (no `code blocks`).
