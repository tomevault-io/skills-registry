# Constitutional Compliance Skill

## When to Use

Activate this skill when:
- Checking if work follows constitutional principles
- Before creating pull requests or commits
- User asks "does this comply with the constitution?"
- Validating specifications, plans, or task lists
- Code review focusing on constitutional adherence
- Before releases or major milestones

**Trigger Keywords**: constitutional, compliance, constitution check, validate principles, follows rules

**Critical Moments**:
- After creating specification (validate Principle VIII)
- After creating plan (validate Principles I, II, III)
- Before committing code (validate all applicable principles)
- Before creating PR (full constitutional review)
- Before release (comprehensive audit)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Read the Constitution

**Load the constitution**:
```bash
Read: .specify/memory/constitution.md
```

**Understand the 14 principles** organized in 3 tiers:

**Immutable Principles (I-III)** - NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- **Principle I**: Library-First Architecture
- **Principle II**: Test-First Development
- **Principle III**: Contract-First Design

**Quality & Safety Principles (IV-IX)** - STANDARD:
- **Principle IV**: Idempotent Operations
- **Principle V**: Progressive Enhancement
- **Principle VI**: Git Operation Approval
- **Principle VII**: Observability
- **Principle VIII**: Documentation Synchronization
- **Principle IX**: Dependency Management

**Workflow & Delegation Principles (X-XIV)** - CRITICAL/STANDARD:
- **Principle X**: Agent Delegation Protocol (CRITICAL)
- **Principle XI**: Input Validation & Output Sanitization (CRITICAL)
- **Principle XII**: Design System Compliance
- **Principle XIII**: Access Control
- **Principle XIV**: AI Model Selection

### Step 2: Run Automated Compliance Check

**Execute the constitutional check script**:
```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/constitutional-check.sh
```

**Script checks for**:
- Principle I: Library-first architecture evidence
- Principle II: Test files and TDD workflow
- Principle III: Contract definitions
- Principle VI: No autonomous git operations
- Principle VII: Logging and observability
- Principle VIII: Documentation synchronization
- Principle IX: Declared dependencies
- Principle X: Agent delegation references
- Principle XI: Input validation patterns

**Interpret results**:
- ✅ PASSING: Principle compliance detected
- ⚠️ SKIPPED: Check not applicable to current context
- ❌ FAILING: Principle violation detected

### Step 3: Manual Principle Review

Some principles require human judgment. Review manually:

#### Principle IV: Idempotent Operations
**Check**:
- Can operations be safely repeated?
- Do operations check current state before acting?
- Are operations deterministic (same input → same output)?

**Examples**:
```typescript
// ✅ Idempotent
async function ensureUserExists(email: string) {
  const existing = await db.users.findByEmail(email);
  if (existing) return existing; // Already exists, return it
  return await db.users.create({ email });
}

// ❌ Not Idempotent
async function createUser(email: string) {
  return await db.users.create({ email }); // Fails if user exists
}
```

#### Principle V: Progressive Enhancement
**Check**:
- Does implementation start with simplest solution?
- Is complexity added only when needed (YAGNI)?
- Can features be enabled incrementally?

**Red Flags**:
- Premature optimization
- Over-engineered solutions
- Features not in specification

#### Principle XII: Design System Compliance
**Check** (for UI work):
- Uses design system components?
- Follows design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)?
- Matches design mockups?

#### Principle XIII: Access Control
**Check** (for user-facing features):
- Authentication implemented?
- Authorization checks at every boundary?
- Role-based access control (RBAC)?
- Row-level security (RLS) in database?

#### Principle XIV: AI Model Selection
**Check** (for AI-assisted work):
- Haiku for quick, straightforward tasks?
- Sonnet for complex, multi-step work?
- Opus for critical, high-stakes decisions?

### Step 4: Context-Specific Compliance

**For Specifications**:
- [ ] Principle VIII: Documentation includes spec.md
- [ ] Principle X: Identifies required domains/agents

**For Plans**:
- [ ] Principle I: Describes library-first architecture
- [ ] Principle II: Includes testing strategy
- [ ] Principle III: Defines contracts before implementation
- [ ] Principle VIII: Generates all required artifacts
- [ ] Principle IX: Lists all dependencies with versions

**For Tasks**:
- [ ] Principle II: Test tasks before implementation tasks
- [ ] Principle III: Contract test tasks included
- [ ] Principle X: Identifies agents for task execution

**For Code**:
- [ ] Principle I: Implemented as standalone library
- [ ] Principle II: Tests written and passing
- [ ] Principle III: Contracts implemented as specified
- [ ] Principle VII: Logging for key operations
- [ ] Principle XI: Input validation and output sanitization
- [ ] Principle XIII: Authorization checks (if user-facing)

**For Git Operations**:
- [ ] Principle VI: User approval obtained BEFORE git operations

**For Scripts**:
- [ ] Principle IV: Idempotent (safe to re-run)
- [ ] Principle VI: Requests approval for git operations
- [ ] Principle VII: Logs operations and outcomes

### Step 5: Report Compliance Status

**Provide compliance report**:
```
🏛️ Constitutional Compliance Report

Automated Checks: X/9 passing, Y skipped, Z failing

✅ Immutable Principles (I-III):
- Principle I (Library-First): [status]
- Principle II (Test-First): [status]
- Principle III (Contract-First): [status]

✅ Quality & Safety (IV-IX):
- Principle IV (Idempotent): [status - manual review]
- Principle V (Progressive): [status - manual review]
- Principle VI (Git Approval): [status]
- Principle VII (Observability): [status]
- Principle VIII (Documentation): [status]
- Principle IX (Dependencies): [status]

✅ Workflow & Delegation (X-XIV):
- Principle X (Agent Delegation): [status]
- Principle XI (Validation/Sanitization): [status]
- Principle XII (Design System): [status - manual review]
- Principle XIII (Access Control): [status - manual review]
- Principle XIV (AI Model Selection): [status - manual review]

Overall Status: [COMPLIANT / NON-COMPLIANT / NEEDS REVIEW]

Violations: [list any violations]
Warnings: [list any concerns]
Recommendations: [suggested improvements]
```

### Step 6: Violation Resolution

**If violations found**:

1. **STOP** - Do not proceed with non-compliant work
2. **Report** - Clearly identify which principle(s) violated
3. **Explain** - Why it violates (reference constitution)
4. **Suggest** - How to fix the violation
5. **Verify** - Re-check after fix applied

**Immutable Principle Violations** (I-III):
- **BLOCKING** - Cannot proceed without fix
- Must be resolved before any commit/merge

**Critical Principle Violations** (X, XI):
- **HIGH PRIORITY** - Must resolve before release
- May be acceptable for WIP but must be tracked

**Standard Principle Violations** (IV-IX, XII-XIV):
- **SHOULD FIX** - Address before PR
- Document if intentional exception (rare)

## Constitutional Compliance

This skill EMBODIES constitutional compliance:

- **Principle VI**: Never runs git operations without approval
- **Principle VIII**: Ensures documentation stays synchronized
- **Principle X**: Part of quality gate for agent delegation
- **Uses constitutional check script**: `.specify/scripts/bash/constitutional-check.sh`

## Examples

### Example 1: Pre-Commit Compliance Check

**User Request**: "Check if my changes comply with the constitution before I commit"

**Skill Execution**:
1. Read constitution
2. Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/constitutional-check.sh`
3. Automated results: 8/9 passing, 1 skipped (design system N/A)
4. Manual review:
   - Principle IV: Code is idempotent ✅
   - Principle V: No premature optimization ✅
   - Principle XIII: Authorization checks present ✅
5. Report: COMPLIANT - safe to commit

### Example 2: Plan Compliance Validation

**User Request**: "Validate my implementation plan follows constitutional principles"

**Skill Execution**:
1. Read constitution
2. Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/constitutional-check.sh`
3. Automated results: 5/9 passing
   - ❌ FAILING: Principle II - No testing strategy mentioned
   - ❌ FAILING: Principle III - No contracts defined
4. Manual review:
   - Plan missing required artifacts
5. Report: NON-COMPLIANT
   - **Violation**: Principles II & III (immutable)
   - **Fix**: Add testing strategy section, generate contracts/
   - **Block**: Cannot proceed to tasks without fixing

### Example 3: Code Review Compliance

**User Request**: "Review this PR for constitutional compliance"

**Skill Execution**:
1. Read constitution
2. Run automated check
3. Automated results: 9/9 passing ✅
4. Manual review of code:
   - **Principle XI**: Input validation present ✅
   - **Principle XIII**: Authorization checks present ✅
   - **Principle V**: No unnecessary complexity ✅
5. Report: COMPLIANT - approve PR

## Validation

Verify the skill executed correctly:

- [ ] Constitution read and understood
- [ ] Automated check executed
- [ ] Automated results interpreted correctly
- [ ] Manual review performed for judgment-based principles
- [ ] Context-specific checks performed (spec/plan/task/code)
- [ ] Compliance report generated
- [ ] Violations clearly identified (if any)
- [ ] Fixes suggested for violations
- [ ] Overall status determined (compliant/non-compliant/needs-review)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Automated check fails with "Constitution not found"

**Cause**: Not in repository root directory

**Solution**:
- Run from repository root
- Use absolute path to constitution: `/workspaces/sdd-agentic-framework/.specify/memory/constitution.md`

### Issue: Many principles show "SKIPPED"

**Cause**: Checks not applicable to current work type

**Solution**:
- This is normal - not all principles apply to all work
- Focus on PASSING and FAILING statuses
- Skipped checks don't indicate problems

### Issue: Unclear if code violates Principle XI

**Cause**: Input validation can be subtle

**Solution**:
- Look for: zod schemas, joi validation, input type checking
- Check all user inputs (forms, query params, path params, headers)
- Check all external data (API responses, file uploads, database reads)
- If no validation found → violation

### Issue: Don't know which principles apply to current work

**Cause**: Constitution has 14 principles

**Solution**:
- **All work**: I, II, III (immutable - always apply)
- **APIs/Services**: VII, IX, XI
- **UI work**: XII, XIII
- **Scripts**: IV, VI, VII
- **AI-assisted**: XIV
- **Architecture**: I, III, IX, X

## Notes

- Constitutional compliance is NON-NEGOTIABLE for immutable principles
- Automated check catches ~60% of violations
- Manual review required for judgment-based principles
- Run before every commit, PR, and release
- Violations of I, II, III are BLOCKING - cannot merge
- Document any intentional exceptions (should be very rare)
- Constitution is living document - may be amended via checklist process
- All agents and skills must comply with constitution
