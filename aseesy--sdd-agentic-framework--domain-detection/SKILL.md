# Domain Detection Skill

## When to Use

Activate this skill when:
- Need to identify which domains/agents are involved in work
- User asks "which agent should handle this?"
- Determining delegation strategy (single vs multi-agent)
- After creating specification (identify domains early)
- After creating plan (confirm domains, detect new ones)
- Before executing tasks (route to correct agents)

**Trigger Keywords**: which agent, domain, who should, delegate to, specialist, orchestrator

**Automatic Activation**: `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks` commands automatically use this skill

## Procedure

### Step 1: Load Agent Collaboration Reference

**Read the agent collaboration triggers document**:
```bash
Read: .specify/memory/agent-collaboration-triggers.md
```

**Understand the 11 domains**:
1. **Frontend** - UI, components, client-side
2. **Backend** - APIs, servers, business logic
3. **Database** - Schema, queries, data modeling
4. **Testing** - Quality assurance, test automation
5. **Security** - Authentication, authorization, vulnerabilities
6. **Performance** - Optimization, scaling, monitoring
7. **DevOps** - CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure
8. **Architecture** - System design, patterns, decisions
9. **Specification** - Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
10. **Tasks** - Work breakdown, dependencies, planning
11. **Integration** - External APIs, third-party services

### Step 2: Analyze Text for Domain Keywords

**If analyzing a file**:
```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/detect-phase-domain.sh --file PATH_TO_FILE
```

**If analyzing user text**:
```bash
echo "TEXT_TO_ANALYZE" | .specify/scripts/bash/detect-phase-domain.sh --text
```

**Script performs keyword-based detection**:
- Counts domain keyword occurrences
- Scores each domain (weighted by keyword frequency)
- Identifies significant domains (threshold: 3+ keywords)
- Determines delegation strategy

**Domain Keywords (Examples)**:

**Frontend**: ui, user interface, component, view, screen, page, react, vue, angular, css, html, styling, responsive, mobile, desktop, web app, client-side

**Backend**: api, endpoint, server, service, route, handler, middleware, controller, business logic, authentication, authorization, session, jwt, rest, graphql

**Database**: database, schema, table, query, sql, nosql, postgres, mongodb, redis, migration, index, relationship, foreign key, primary key, data model, entity

**Testing**: test, testing, tdd, unit test, integration test, e2e, jest, vitest, cypress, playwright, coverage, assertion, mock, stub, test case

**Security**: security, vulnerability, authentication, authorization, rbac, permission, role, owasp, xss, sql injection, csrf, encryption, password, secret, token

### Step 3: Interpret Detection Results

**Parse JSON output**:
```json
{
  "detected_domains": ["frontend", "backend", "database"],
  "domain_scores": {
    "frontend": 8,
    "backend": 12,
    "database": 5
  },
  "significant_domains": ["frontend", "backend", "database"],
  "delegation_strategy": "multi-agent",
  "suggested_agents": [
    "frontend-specialist",
    "backend-architect",
    "database-specialist",
    "task-orchestrator"
  ],
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

**Domain Count Rules**:
- **0 domains**: Generic work, no specialist needed
- **1 domain**: Single-agent delegation
- **2 domains**: Single or dual-agent delegation (evaluate complexity)
- **3+ domains**: Multi-agent delegation via task-orchestrator

### Step 4: Determine Delegation Strategy

**Single-Agent Delegation**:
- One significant domain detected
- Work is contained within domain
- No cross-domain dependencies

**Example**: "Implement user profile card component"
- Domain: frontend
- Agent: frontend-specialist
- Strategy: single-agent

**Multi-Agent Delegation**:
- Multiple significant domains (3+)
- Work spans domain boundaries
- Requires coordination

**Example**: "Implement user registration with email verification"
- Domains: backend, database, security, integration
- Agents: backend-architect, database-specialist, security-specialist, task-orchestrator
- Strategy: multi-agent (orchestrator coordinates)

**task-orchestrator Required When**:
- 3+ significant domains detected
- Complex cross-domain coordination needed
- Multiple specialists must work together

### Step 5: Map Domains to Agents

**Agent Mapping** (from agent collaboration reference):

| Domain | Specialist Agent | Department |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Frontend | frontend-specialist | Engineering |
| Backend | backend-architect | Architecture |
| Database | database-specialist | Data |
| Testing | testing-specialist | Quality |
| Security | security-specialist | Quality |
| Performance | performance-engineer | Operations |
| DevOps | devops-engineer | Operations |
| Architecture | backend-architect, subagent-architect | Architecture |
| Specification | specification-agent | Product |
| Tasks | tasks-agent | Product |
| Integration | backend-architect, devops-engineer | Multiple |

**Coordination Agent**:
- **task-orchestrator** (Product dept): Coordinates multi-agent workflows

### Step 6: Report Detection Results

**Provide comprehensive domain analysis**:
```
🔍 Domain Detection Results

Text Analyzed: [file path or description]
Analysis Method: [keyword-based detection]

Detected Domains (X total):
- Frontend: Score 8 (significant)
- Backend: Score 12 (significant)
- Database: Score 5 (significant)
- Testing: Score 2 (minor)

Significant Domains: frontend, backend, database

Delegation Strategy: multi-agent

Suggested Agents:
- frontend-specialist (Engineering) - UI components
- backend-architect (Architecture) - API design
- database-specialist (Data) - Schema design
- task-orchestrator (Product) - Coordinate workflow

Confidence: High

Rationale:
- 3 significant domains detected (frontend, backend, database)
- Cross-domain work requires coordination
- task-orchestrator recommended to manage specialists

Next Step:
- Delegate to task-orchestrator
- task-orchestrator will route work to specialists
- Specialists collaborate on implementation
```

## Constitutional Compliance

### Principle X: Agent Delegation Protocol
**This skill IMPLEMENTS Principle X**:

- Analyzes task domain
- Identifies specialized agents
- Determines delegation strategy
- Ensures specialized work → specialized agents

**Principle X Workflow** (4 mandatory steps):
1. READ CONSTITUTION ✅
2. ANALYZE TASK DOMAIN ✅ (this skill)
3. DELEGATION DECISION ✅ (this skill)
4. EXECUTION (agent executes)

**Critical Triggers** from Principle X:
- "test" → testing-specialist
- "database" → database-specialist
- "API" → backend-architect
- "component" → frontend-specialist
- "security" → security-specialist
- "deploy" → devops-engineer
- "optimize" → performance-engineer

## Examples

### Example 1: Single-Domain Detection

**User Request**: "Implement a loading spinner component for React"

**Skill Execution**:
1. Load agent collaboration reference
2. Analyze text: "loading spinner component React"
3. Detect keywords: component (frontend), React (frontend), UI (frontend)
4. Results:
   - Domains: frontend (score: 5)
   - Significant: frontend
   - Strategy: single-agent
   - Agents: frontend-specialist

**Output**:
```
🔍 Domain Detection Results

Detected Domains: frontend
Delegation Strategy: single-agent
Suggested Agent: frontend-specialist (Engineering)

Rationale: Pure frontend UI component work
```

### Example 2: Multi-Domain Detection

**User Request**: "Build user authentication with email, password, JWT tokens, and PostgreSQL storage"

**Skill Execution**:
1. Load reference
2. Analyze text
3. Detect keywords:
   - Backend: api, endpoint, jwt, token, authentication
   - Database: postgresql, storage, schema
   - Security: authentication, password, token
4. Results:
   - Domains: backend (12), database (6), security (8)
   - Significant: backend, database, security
   - Strategy: multi-agent
   - Agents: backend-architect, database-specialist, security-specialist, task-orchestrator

**Output**:
```
🔍 Domain Detection Results

Detected Domains: backend, database, security
Delegation Strategy: multi-agent
Suggested Agents:
- backend-architect - API design, JWT handling
- database-specialist - User schema, sessions
- security-specialist - Password hashing, auth security
- task-orchestrator - Coordinate workflow

Rationale: 3 domains require specialist coordination
```

### Example 3: No Specialist Needed

**User Request**: "Update README with installation instructions"

**Skill Execution**:
1. Load reference
2. Analyze text: "README installation instructions"
3. Detect keywords: documentation (general)
4. Results:
   - Domains: none significant
   - Strategy: no delegation needed
   - Can be handled without specialist

**Output**:
```
🔍 Domain Detection Results

Detected Domains: None significant
Delegation Strategy: No specialist needed
Suggestion: Handle directly (simple documentation update)

Rationale: No specialized domain work detected
```

## Agent Collaboration

### task-orchestrator
**When to suggest**: 3+ significant domains detected

**What they do**: Coordinate multiple specialists, manage workflow, ensure integration

### All Specialist Agents
**When to suggest**: Domain detected matches their specialty

**What they do**: Execute specialized work in their domain

### Work Session Initiation Protocol
**This skill supports Step 2** of the mandatory 4-step protocol:
1. READ CONSTITUTION (required before this skill)
2. **ANALYZE TASK DOMAIN** ← THIS SKILL
3. DELEGATION DECISION (based on this skill's output)
4. EXECUTION (execute directly or delegate)

## Validation

Verify the skill executed correctly:

- [ ] Agent collaboration reference loaded
- [ ] Text analyzed (file or user input)
- [ ] Domain detection script executed
- [ ] Detection results parsed (JSON)
- [ ] Domain scores calculated
- [ ] Significant domains identified
- [ ] Delegation strategy determined
- [ ] Agents mapped to domains
- [ ] Results reported to user
- [ ] Confidence level assessed
- [ ] Rationale provided

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No domains detected for obviously technical work

**Cause**: Keywords not in detection dictionary

**Solution**:
- Review `.specify/scripts/bash/detect-phase-domain.sh` keyword lists
- Add missing keywords to appropriate domain
- Re-run detection

### Issue: Wrong domains detected

**Cause**: Ambiguous keywords or keyword overlap

**Solution**:
- Review domain scores (not just presence/absence)
- Higher score = stronger signal
- Consider context (not just keywords)
- Manual override if clearly incorrect

### Issue: Single-agent vs multi-agent unclear (2 domains)

**Cause**: Edge case (2 domains can go either way)

**Solution**:
- Evaluate complexity:
  - Simple integration → single-agent can handle both
  - Complex coordination → use multi-agent with orchestrator
- Default to multi-agent if unsure (safer)

### Issue: Multiple agents from same department

**Cause**: Domain maps to multiple specialists

**Solution**:
- Choose most specific agent
- Example: "system architecture" could be backend-architect or subagent-architect
  - For implementation architecture → backend-architect
  - For agent/constitutional architecture → subagent-architect

## Notes

- Domain detection is keyword-based (fast but not perfect)
- High domain scores indicate stronger presence of that domain
- task-orchestrator is "coordinator" not a domain specialist
- Single-agent delegation is simpler and faster (prefer when possible)
- Multi-agent delegation provides better quality for complex work
- Principle X makes delegation MANDATORY for specialized work
- This skill automates Step 2 of Work Session Initiation Protocol
- Detection runs automatically in /specify, /plan, /tasks workflows
- Can be run standalone on any text/file
