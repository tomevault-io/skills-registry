name: read-software-docs
description: Read and navigate software package documentation websites. Use when the user provides a documentation URL and wants to understand an API, SDK, framework, or library. Triggers on requests like "read the docs at [url]", "look up [topic] in the [package] documentation", "what does [API] do according to the docs", or any task requiring fetching and comprehending online software documentation. Supports any HTML-based documentation site including Sphinx, Doxygen, ReadTheDocs, MkDocs, and custom doc sites. Common targets include NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Omniverse Kit, OpenUSD, ROS 2, PyTorch, and similar software packages. Use when this capability is needed.

# Read Software Docs

Fetch, parse, and navigate software documentation websites to answer user questions or build understanding of APIs, SDKs, and frameworks.

## Script

`scripts/fetch_docs.py` — run with the project venv:

```
.venv/bin/python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/fetch_docs.py <mode> <url> [options]
```

**Modes:**

| Mode | Purpose | Key Options |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `page` | Fetch a single page as clean markdown | `--output FILE` |
| `links` | List all internal doc links on a page | `--filter REGEX` |
| `sitemap` | Crawl from a root URL, build page tree | `--depth N` (default 1), `--filter REGEX`, `--output FILE` |

Dependencies (`beautifulsoup4`, `html2text`, `requests`) must be installed in the `.venv`.

## Workflow

### 1. Orient: discover the doc structure

Start with `links` mode on the user's URL (or the doc site index) to see available pages:

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/fetch_docs.py links <url>
```

Use `--filter` to narrow results when the link list is large:
```bash
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/fetch_docs.py links <url> --filter "api|reference|python"
```

For broader discovery, use `sitemap` with shallow depth:
```bash
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/fetch_docs.py sitemap <url> --depth 1
```

### 2. Read: fetch specific pages

Fetch pages identified in step 1:

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/fetch_docs.py page <page-url>
```

For large pages, save to a file and read selectively:
```bash
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/fetch_docs.py page <page-url> --output .cache/knowledge/doc_page.md
```

### 3. Drill down: follow links as needed

If the initial page references sub-pages or related APIs, fetch those too. Repeat steps 1-2 to navigate deeper into the documentation tree.

### 4. Synthesize

After reading the relevant pages, produce the deliverable the user requested — this could be:
- A summary of an API or module
- A how-to guide assembled from multiple doc pages
- Answers to specific questions about the software
- Code examples based on the documented API

Save research output to `.knowledge/` for easy user access (same pattern as `read-arxiv-paper`).

## Tips

- **WebFetch fallback**: If `fetch_docs.py` struggles with a page (e.g., JavaScript-rendered content), fall back to the `WebFetch` tool which may handle it differently.
- **API docs**: For Python/C++ API reference pages, use `--filter` with module names to quickly find the right page (e.g., `--filter "omni.isaac.core|isaacsim"`).
- **Version pinning**: Many doc sites include version numbers in URLs. Confirm the user wants the version in the URL before deeply reading docs for a different version.
- **Caching**: Save fetched pages to `.cache/knowledge/` to avoid re-fetching during a session. Use descriptive filenames like `.cache/knowledge/isaacsim_core_api.md`.
