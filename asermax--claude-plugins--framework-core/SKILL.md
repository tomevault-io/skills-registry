# Framework Core Skill

Core skill that establishes workflow context for all katachi framework commands.

## When to Load

All framework commands should load this skill first to establish:
- Collaborative workflow principles
- Status tracking conventions
- Scratchpad usage patterns
- Context bridging guidelines
- Decision type guidance (ADR vs DES)

## Project Templates

These templates are used when creating project structure:

**Planning documents:**
- `references/VISION-template.md` - Vision document structure
- `references/DELTAS-template.md` - Delta inventory structure (work tracking)

**Decision documents:**
- `references/ADR-template.md` - Architecture Decision Record format
- `references/DES-template.md` - Design Pattern document format

**Feature documentation:**
- `../working-on-delta/references/feature-spec.md` - Long-lived feature specification
- `../working-on-delta/references/feature-design.md` - Long-lived feature design
- `../working-on-delta/references/feature-domain-readme.md` - Domain index template
- `../working-on-delta/references/feature-specs-readme.md` - Top-level feature index

**Delta working documents:**
- `../working-on-delta/references/delta-spec.md` - Delta specification (working doc)
- `../working-on-delta/references/delta-design.md` - Delta design (working doc)
- `../working-on-delta/references/implementation-plan.md` - Implementation plan (working doc)

**Guidance documents** (how to write each document type):
- `../working-on-delta/references/spec-template.md` - How to write delta specifications
- `../working-on-delta/references/design-template.md` - How to write design rationale
- `../working-on-delta/references/plan-template.md` - How to write implementation plans

## Decision Types Reference

Load `references/decision-types.md` when:
- Creating a new decision document (ADR or DES)
- Determining which document type to use for a pattern/choice
- Retrofitting existing decisions from code
- Teaching users about ADR vs DES distinction

This reference contains the full decision tree and examples for choosing between ADRs (one-time architectural choices) and DES (repeatable patterns).

## State Detection

Before executing any command, detect project state:

### 1. Not Initialized
**Condition:** No `docs/planning/` directory exists

**Action:**
- If no significant code exists → Offer `/katachi:init-framework`
- If code exists → Explain retrofit options

### 2. Partially Initialized
**Condition:** `docs/planning/` exists but missing VISION.md or DELTAS.md

**Action:**
- List what's missing
- Offer to complete setup
- Show which commands to run

### 3. Fully Initialized
**Condition:** All planning files exist

**Action:**
- Proceed with normal command operation
- Show current focus from CLAUDE.md if available

### 4. Retrofit Mode
**Condition:** Code exists but no framework documentation

**Action:**
- Explain retrofit commands available
- Offer `/katachi:retrofit-spec` for existing modules
- Offer `/katachi:retrofit-decision` for existing patterns

---

## Workflow Principles

Common principles for all collaborative command workflows in this framework.

### Core Principles

#### 1. One Question at a Time

Never batch multiple questions. Wait for answer before proceeding.

**Why:** Prevents cognitive overload, maintains clear conversation flow, ensures each decision gets proper attention.

#### 2. Propose, Don't Decide

Agent proposes options, user confirms. Never add or change anything without user agreement.

**Why:** User is the architect, Claude is the implementer. Maintain this relationship throughout.

#### 3. Use AskUserQuestion for Structured Options

When presenting 2-4 distinct choices, use the AskUserQuestion tool:

- Provide clear header (max 12 chars, e.g., "Logging", "Format", "Approach")
- Write complete question text
- Add description explaining each option and its implications
- Use `multiSelect: true` if choices aren't mutually exclusive
- Examples: installation modes, logging approaches, technical choices, format options

**When to use plain text instead:**
- Open-ended questions (no predefined options)
- Single simple clarification needed
- Asking for creative input
- Yes/no questions

#### 4. Detect Gaps Proactively

Throughout the entire process:
- Surface unstated assumptions by asking about them
- Identify potential edge cases and ask user if they're relevant
- Challenge vague or incomplete answers
- Ask "what could go wrong?" and "what's missing?"
- Never fill gaps yourself - always ask the user

#### 5. Use a Scratchpad

Track state in `/tmp/<command>-state.md`:

**Commands with natural IDs:**
- For `-delta` commands, include the delta ID: `/tmp/<command>-<FEATURE-ID>-state.md`
  - `/spec-delta`: `/tmp/spec-<FEATURE-ID>-state.md`
  - `/design-delta`: `/tmp/design-<FEATURE-ID>-state.md`
  - `/plan-delta`: `/tmp/plan-<FEATURE-ID>-state.md`
  - `/implement-delta`: `/tmp/implement-<FEATURE-ID>-state.md`

**Commands without natural IDs (parallel execution support):**
- Generate unique animal-adjective ID: `/tmp/<command>-<animal-adjective>-state.md`
  - `/add-delta`: `/tmp/add-delta-<animal-adjective>-state.md`
  - `/analyze`: `/tmp/analyze-<animal-adjective>-state.md`
  - `/analyze-impact`: `/tmp/analyze-impact-<animal-adjective>-state.md`
  - `/decision`: `/tmp/decision-<animal-adjective>-state.md`
  - `/review-code`: `/tmp/review-code-<animal-adjective>-state.md`
  - Enables multiple concurrent sessions without state file conflicts
  - Keep state files after completion (don't auto-clean) for debugging/audit trail

**Commands scoped by project name (directory basename):**
- `/vision`, `/deltas`, `/dependencies` - Use `/tmp/<command>-<project-name>-state.md`

**Commands without scratchpads:**
- `/commit`, `/record-learnings` - No scratchpad needed

**Scratchpad contents:**
- Current section/phase being worked on
- Questions asked and answered
- Gaps identified
- Topics to revisit
- Decisions made

**Why:** Prevents information loss across question rounds, maintains context during iteration.

#### 6. Bridge the Context Gap

The agent reads multiple files (specs, designs, ADRs, DES patterns) and builds comprehensive context. The user reads documents when needed but doesn't have the full picture simultaneously.

**When asking questions or explaining decisions:**
- Include diagrams (ASCII art, sequence diagrams, thread/data flows)
- Provide rich context - don't assume shared understanding
- Explain the "why" behind technical questions
- Show concrete examples, not abstract references
- Name the specific files, components, or patterns being referenced

#### 7. Research When Needed

When user shows uncertainty, research to provide informed options.

**Research triggers:**
- User says "I'm not sure" or "I don't know"
- Topic involves technical choices (models, libraries, protocols, frameworks)
- User asks "what options do I have?"
- User mentions alternatives they've tried but weren't satisfied with

Use Task tool (general-purpose agent) to research, then synthesize findings to inform questions.

### Workflow Modes

#### Information Gathering

**Use for:** Understanding requirements, clarifying scope, exploring options

**Workflow:**
- Ask one question at a time
- Wait for answer before proceeding
- Use AskUserQuestion for structured choices
- Build understanding incrementally

#### Document Creation

**Use for:** Specs, designs, plans, decisions

**Workflow:**
1. **Research phase (silent, thorough)**
   - Read spec/requirements
   - Read relevant ADRs and DES patterns
   - Explore related codebase areas if needed
   - Research official documentation for libraries/frameworks/APIs
   - Build understanding without asking upfront questions

2. **Draft proposal (with decision points)**
   - Create complete document following template
   - Base all choices on research findings
   - Note any uncertainties/assumptions clearly
   - **If choices require user input:** Use AskUserQuestion (ambiguous requirements, multiple valid approaches, trade-offs)

3. **External validation (silent)**
   - Dispatch appropriate reviewer agent
   - Agent provides structured feedback

4. **Apply validation feedback (silent, with decision points)**
   - Apply ALL recommendations automatically
   - **If applying requires a choice:** Use AskUserQuestion (multiple valid fixes, conflicts with earlier decisions)
   - Track changes for presentation

5. **Present validated document**
   - Show complete document to user
   - Include summary of applied validation fixes
   - Highlight unresolved issues
   - Invite user feedback: "What needs adjustment?"

6. **Iterate based on user feedback**
   - Apply user corrections/additions
   - Re-run validation if significant changes
   - Repeat until user approves

7. **Finalize**
   - Write document to file
   - Update status

**Key principle:** Validate before presenting, auto-apply fixes. Only use AskUserQuestion for genuine decisions (multiple valid options), not for fixes.

### Validation Best Practices

#### Use Custom Agents for Validation

Dispatch the appropriate reviewer agent for validation:

| Document Type | Reviewer Agent |
|--------------|----------------|
| Delta Spec | `katachi:spec-reviewer` |
| Delta Design | `katachi:design-reviewer` |
| Implementation Plan | `katachi:plan-reviewer` |
| Implemented Code | `katachi:code-reviewer` |
| Change Impact | `katachi:impact-analyzer` |
| Existing Code | `katachi:codebase-analyzer` |

Dispatch agents using the Task tool with appropriate `subagent_type`.

#### Validation Context

Balance fresh perspective with respecting user decisions:

**Include in validation context:**
- The artifact being validated (spec, design, code, etc.)
- Relevant templates and examples
- User's explicit decisions and constraints
- Project-wide patterns (ADRs, DES documents)

**Exclude from validation context:**
- Agent's internal reasoning and discussion history
- Intermediate drafts and iterations
- Unrelated project context

### Collaborative Process

**This is always a collaborative process:**
- Ask one question at a time
- Agent proposes, user confirms - never decide without agreement
- User makes all decisions
- Provide alternatives and trade-offs (research-backed when needed)
- Never fill gaps yourself - always ask the user
- Use AskUserQuestion for structured options (2-4 choices)
- Iterate until the user approves the final result

## Shape Up Integration

Katachi adopts specific elements from Ryan Singer's Shape Up methodology to make the spec and design phases more collaborative. Katachi keeps its own phase structure (spec → design → plan → implement).

### What We Use

#### Requirements Table (R)

Compact, prioritized problem-space summary included in delta specs. Built collaboratively with the user during the spec interview — not generated by the agent alone.

Each requirement has a status: `Core goal`, `Must-have`, `Nice-to-have`, or `Out`. Up to 30 top-level requirements; use sub-IDs (R3.1, R3.2) for grouping.

Requirements state WHAT is needed. Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then) define HOW to verify each requirement.

#### Shape Parts Table

Solution mechanisms included in delta designs. Built collaboratively with the user — the agent proposes mechanisms and the user refines before the shape is seeded. Each part describes what to build or change — a concrete mechanism, not a constraint (constraints belong in the spec's Requirements table).

Parts have a flag column: empty = mechanism is understood, ⚠️ = unknown that needs investigation. Flagged parts must include a description below the table explaining what the unknown is. Flagged parts are resolved during design phase via research or spikes.

The shape is seeded during spec phase (high-level mechanisms, collaboratively refined with user) and evolved during design phase (detailed mechanisms with unknowns resolved).

#### Requirements Coverage Check

Internal validation step used during spec and design phases. Not persisted in any document.

After drafting shape parts, verify:
- Every requirement (R) has at least one shape part addressing it — otherwise there's a missing mechanism
- Every shape part traces back to at least one requirement — otherwise there's scope creep

If the check reveals gaps, surface them to the user before proceeding.

#### Spikes

Lightweight investigation artifacts for resolving unknowns in shape parts. A spike asks specific questions, researches answers, and may surface new requirements that feed back to the spec.

Spikes are dispatched as subagent tasks and validated with the user. Template: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/working-on-delta/references/spike-template.md`

Location in projects: `docs/spikes/SPIKE-DLT-XXX-topic.md`

### Cross-Phase Flow

1. **Spec phase**: Builds R table collaboratively → derives AC from requirements → drafts initial shape → validates coverage internally → **refines shape collaboratively with user** → seeds design doc with user-approved shape
2. **Design phase**: Reads initial shape → resolves unknowns via spikes → evolves shape into full design → **presents evolved shape to user** → validates coverage against R

## Status Tracking

Conventions for tracking delta progress through the development workflow.

### Status Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✗ | Not Started |
| ⧗ | In Progress |
| ✓ | Complete |

### Status Progression

Deltas progress through these stages:

```
✗ Defined         (initial state - delta in DELTAS.md)
    ↓
⧗ Spec            (/spec-delta starts)
    ↓
✓ Spec            (/spec-delta completes)
    ↓
⧗ Design          (/design-delta starts)
    ↓
✓ Design          (/design-delta completes)
    ↓
⧗ Plan            (/plan-delta starts)
    ↓
✓ Plan            (/plan-delta completes)
    ↓
⧗ Implementation  (/implement-delta starts)
    ↓
✓ Implementation  (/implement-delta completes)
```

### When to Update Status

#### At Command Start
Set status to in-progress state (⧗) for the current phase.

Example: `/spec-delta CORE-001` → set status to "⧗ Spec"

#### At Command Completion
Set status to complete state (✓) for the current phase.

Example: `/spec-delta CORE-001` finishes → set status to "✓ Spec"

### How to Update Status

Use the deltas.py script:

```bash
# Set status
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status set FEATURE-ID "STATUS"

# Examples
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status set CORE-001 "⧗ Spec"
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status set CORE-001 "✓ Spec"
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status set CORE-001 "⧗ Design"
```

### Querying Status

```bash
# List all deltas with status
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status list

# Filter by category
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status list --category CORE

# Filter by status
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status list --status "✓ Spec"

# Show detailed delta status
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status show CORE-001
```

### Status in DELTAS.md

Status is stored in DELTAS.md as a column:

```markdown
| ID | Description | Complexity | Status |
|----|-------------|------------|--------|
| CORE-001 | Delta description | Medium | ✓ Design |
| CORE-002 | Another delta | Easy | ⧗ Spec |
```

### Ready to Implement

A delta is ready to implement when:
1. All dependencies have status "✓ Implementation" or higher
2. The delta has status "✓ Plan"

Use this command to check:
```bash
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py ready
```

---

## Priority Tracking

Priority helps determine which delta to work on next when multiple are ready.

### Priority Levels

| Level | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Critical | Blocks release, must do now |
| 2 | High | Important, needed soon |
| 3 | Medium | Standard priority (default) |
| 4 | Low | Nice to have |
| 5 | Backlog | Someday/maybe |

This scale aligns with MoSCoW (Critical=Must, High=Should, Medium/Low=Could, Backlog=Won't) while providing numerical scoring.

### Priority in DELTAS.md

Priority is stored after Status in each delta entry:

```markdown
### DLT-001: Delta name
**Status**: ✗ Defined
**Priority**: 2 (High)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Description**: [description]
```

If not specified, deltas default to priority 3 (Medium).

### How Priority Affects Suggestions

The `next` command uses a scoring algorithm:
- **Priority weight**: Higher priority = higher score
- **Impact bonus**: More dependents = higher score (completing this unblocks more work)
- **Complexity bonus**: Easier deltas get slight preference (quick wins)

### How to Update Priority

Use the deltas.py script:

```bash
# Set priority
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py priority set DLT-001 2

# List deltas grouped by priority
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py priority list

# Filter by priority level
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py priority list --level 1
```

### When to Set Priority

**At delta creation:** The `/add-delta` command proposes a priority based on:
- Delta description and scope
- Impact on other deltas (dependency count)
- User's expressed goals

**During priority review:** Use `/review-priorities` for a conversational session to:
- Assess current priorities holistically
- Align priorities with current goals/constraints
- Identify priority inconsistencies (e.g., critical delta blocked by low-priority dependency)

---

## Task Management Protocol

Use Claude Code's task tools to track workflow progress within each command.

### Purpose

Tasks provide:
- Visibility into what the command will do (upfront planning)
- Progress tracking via spinner with activeForm text
- Clear completion state for each phase

### When to Create Tasks

Create tasks at command start, after loading skills and reading initial context. Create all tasks upfront with dependencies before beginning work.

### Task Guidelines

**Identify workflow phases:** Review the command's process steps and identify distinct phases (research, draft, validate, iterate, finalize, etc.)

**Create one task per phase:** Each phase becomes a task with:
- `subject`: Imperative action (e.g., "Research context for {ID}")
- `description`: Brief explanation of what happens in this phase
- `activeForm`: Present participle shown in spinner (e.g., "Researching context")

**Set dependencies:** Use `TaskUpdate` with `addBlockedBy` to create a chain. Phases that must complete before others are blocked.

**Include identifiers:** When working with a delta or using a scratchpad ID, include it in task subjects for clarity.

**Progress through tasks:**
1. Mark task as `in_progress` when starting the phase
2. Do the work
3. Mark task as `completed` when done
4. Move to next task

### Integration with Status Tracking

Task management complements delta status tracking:

| System | Purpose | Scope |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `deltas.py` + DELTAS.md | Delta lifecycle status | Cross-session |
| Claude Code Tasks | Workflow phase progress | Within command |

Update both at appropriate points:
- `deltas.py status set` at command start/completion (delta lifecycle)
- `TaskUpdate` as each workflow phase starts/completes (session visibility)

### Commands Without Tasks

Some simple commands may not need task tracking (single-step operations, simple extractions). Use judgment - if there are distinct phases worth tracking, create tasks.
