# Remotion Custom Transitions

This skill teaches you how to build **production-grade, high-energy custom transitions** in Remotion using the `TransitionPresentation` API — the same pattern used in Fyltr's Instagram Reel campaign.

## Quick Reference

- [Custom Transition Pattern](./references/custom-transition-pattern.md) — The `TransitionPresentation` API, the exact component shape, and how timing works
- [Transition Catalog](./references/transition-catalog.md) — 6 battle-tested transitions with full source: Striped Slam, Zoom Punch, Diagonal Reveal, Emerald Burst, Vertical Shutter, Glitch Slam
- [Animation Math](./references/animation-math.md) — Easing functions, stagger formulas, spring configs, and the `clamp` extrapolation pattern used throughout

## Core Concept

Remotion's `@remotion/transitions` package exposes a `TransitionPresentation` type. You implement a **component** that receives:
- `presentationProgress` — `0` at transition start → `1` at transition end
- `presentationDirection` — `"exiting"` (old scene) or `"entering"` (new scene)
- `children` — the scene being wrapped

The same component wraps **both** scenes simultaneously. You animate different things depending on direction.

## Golden Rules

1. **Never use CSS transitions/animations** — all motion via `interpolate()` / `spring()` driven by `presentationProgress`
2. **Never use `useCurrentFrame()`** inside a transition component — use `presentationProgress` only
3. Always return `{ component, props: {} }` — the `props` object must exist even if empty
4. **Create instances outside components** at module level to keep them stable across re-renders
5. Pair with `linearTiming` (for dramatic frame-perfect transitions) or `springTiming` (for springy physics)

## When to Load References

- Building a new custom transition → load [custom-transition-pattern.md](./references/custom-transition-pattern.md) first
- Copying/adapting an existing effect → load [transition-catalog.md](./references/transition-catalog.md)
- Debugging timing or easing math → load [animation-math.md](./references/animation-math.md)
