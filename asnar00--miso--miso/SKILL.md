# Miso Implementation Skill

## Overview

This skill implements the miso feature-to-code workflow. When feature markdown files change, it automatically propagates those changes through the implementation chain: pseudocode → platform-specific code → product code.

## Understanding Miso Features

Miso specifies programs as a tree of **features**: short (<300 word) natural-language markdown files that specify behavior.

**Feature Format**:
- Start with a `#` title
- Followed by an *emphasized* one-line summary
- Up to 300 words of natural language
- Use simple language understandable by users
- Avoid technical jargon and code

**Feature Structure**:
Each feature lives in its own folder containing:
- `spec.md`: The feature specification
- `pseudocode.md`: Natural-language function definitions and patching instructions
- `ios.md`, `android.md`, `py.md`: Platform-specific implementations with actual code
- `imp/`: Folder for other artifacts (logs, debugging notes, test data)

**Feature Hierarchy**:
- To add detail to feature `A/spec.md`, create subfeature `A/B/spec.md`
- To add detail to `A/B/spec.md`, create subfeature `A/B/C/spec.md`
- Keep manageable: no more than 4-6 children per feature
- Group and summarize if children get out of control

## The Implementation Process

When a user changes feature `A/B/spec.md` or adds a subfeature, the implementation process ensures code is created following this routine:

**Step 1: Pseudocode**
- Check if `A/B/pseudocode.md` is up-to-date
- If not, ensure changes to the feature are reflected in pseudocode
- Pseudocode uses natural language function definitions
- Include patching instructions (where/how to integrate into product)

**Step 2: Platform Code**
- Check if platform implementations (`ios.md`, `android.md`, etc.) are up-to-date vs pseudocode
- If not, edit them to reflect the most recent pseudocode changes
- Use platform-appropriate actual code syntax (Swift, Kotlin, Python)

**Step 3: Product Code**
- Check if actual target product code is up-to-date vs platform implementations
- If not, make appropriate modifications to product code
- Follow patching instructions from platform implementation files

**Step 4: Build, Deploy, Test**
- Build and deploy the changed feature to devices/servers
- Run tests if available

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Says "implement features" or "run miso"
- Asks to "update implementations" or "sync code"
- Mentions implementing or deploying feature changes
- Wants to propagate feature changes to code

## Implementation Workflow

The miso implementation process follows this sequence:

### 1. Detect Changed Features

Find all feature `spec.md` files that have changed since the last run:
- Use `git diff` to find modified feature files in `apps/` and `miso/` directories
- Look for files matching pattern `**/spec.md`
- Track the last run timestamp (stored in `.claude/skills/miso/.last-run`)

### 2. Update Pseudocode

For each changed feature `A/B/spec.md`:
- Check if `A/B/pseudocode.md` exists
- If it exists, read both the spec and pseudocode
- Determine if pseudocode needs updating based on spec changes
- If needed, update `A/B/pseudocode.md` to reflect the spec changes
- Use natural language function definitions and patching instructions

### 3. Update Platform Implementations

For each feature with updated pseudocode:
- Check for platform-specific implementations: `A/B/ios.md`, `A/B/android.md`, `A/B/py.md`
- For each existing platform file:
  - Read the pseudocode and platform implementation
  - Determine if platform code needs updating
  - Update platform implementation to match pseudocode
  - Use actual code syntax appropriate for the platform (Swift, Kotlin, Python)

### 4. Update Product Code

For each updated platform implementation:
- Identify the target product (look in `apps/` hierarchy to find the product path)
- Read the patching instructions from the platform implementation
- Locate the actual product code files that need modification
- Apply the changes to product code following the patching instructions
- Make minimal, targeted edits to existing code

### 5. Build, Deploy, and Test

After updating product code:
- Determine which platform was modified (iOS, Android, Python)
- Build and deploy using appropriate scripts:
  - iOS: `./install-device.sh` from product client imp/ios directory
  - Android: `export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk" && ./gradlew assembleDebug && adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
  - Python: `./remote-shutdown.sh && scp && ssh` for remote server deployment
- If a test exists for the feature, run it using `./test-feature.sh <feature-name>`

### 6. Visual Verification and Iterative Debugging (for UI changes)

For features that affect visual appearance (colors, layouts, UI elements), use an **iterative debugging cycle**:

**iOS Visual Verification Cycle**:

1. **Take Screenshot**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/firefly/product/client/imp/ios
   ./restart-app.sh
   sleep 3
   cd /Users/asnaroo/Desktop/experiments/miso/miso/platforms/ios/development/screen-capture/imp
   ./screenshot.sh /tmp/verification-screenshot.png
   ```

2. **Verify Against Specification**:
   - Read the screenshot image
   - Compare what you see to what the feature specification says
   - For color changes: Check if expected color is visible
   - For layout changes: Check if elements are positioned correctly
   - For UI elements: Check if components appear as specified

3. **If Verification PASSES**:
   - Proceed to step 7 (Update Implementation Documentation)

4. **If Verification FAILS**:
   - **Investigate**: Search for ALL files that might contain the old implementation
   - **Example**: For background color, search: `grep -r "Color(red: 64/255" NoobTest/`
   - **Discovery**: You may find the change is needed in multiple files, not just the ones initially updated
   - **Document findings**: Note which files were missed

5. **Fix All Instances**:
   - Update ALL files that need the change
   - Rebuild: `./install-device.sh`
   - Restart: `./restart-app.sh && sleep 3`
   - **Take another screenshot**
   - Read and verify again

6. **Iterate Until Success**:
   - Repeat steps 4-5 until visual verification passes
   - Don't stop at the first failed attempt
   - Each failure teaches you about files that need updating

**Android Visual Verification Cycle**:
1. Restart: `adb shell am force-stop com.miso.noobtest && adb shell am start -n com.miso.noobtest/.MainActivity`
2. Wait: `sleep 3`
3. Screenshot: `adb exec-out screencap -p > /tmp/verification-screenshot.png`
4. Read and verify (same logic as iOS)
5. If fails: Search for missed files, fix, rebuild, repeat

**Key Insight**: Initial implementation often misses files. Visual verification catches this and drives iteration until the visible result matches the specification.

### 7. Post-Debug Cleanup

After visual verification succeeds and the feature works correctly, **update all documentation to accurately reflect what was actually built**. This is critical because the initial implementation often differs from the final working version due to debugging discoveries.

**Run the post-debug cleanup process:**

1. **Review what was actually changed**:
   ```bash
   git diff apps/firefly/product/client/imp/ios/
   ```

2. **Update the feature specification** (`spec.md`):
   - Ensure user-facing description matches final behavior
   - Update visual details (exact colors, sizes, positions)
   - Describe final gesture interactions (thresholds discovered during debugging)
   - Keep <300 words, user-focused language

3. **Update the pseudocode** (`pseudocode.md`):
   - Capture exact specifications discovered during debugging:
     - Gesture thresholds (e.g., "30pt minimum for left swipe", "100pt for right swipe")
     - UI measurements (e.g., "32pt icon with -8pt trailing padding")
     - API endpoints with correct paths and response formats
     - Visual specs (exact RGB values, font sizes, weights)
   - Update patching instructions to reflect ALL files that need changes
   - Include data structures that were added (e.g., new response types)

4. **Update platform implementations** (`ios.md`, `android.md`, etc.):
   - Replace stub code with complete, working code from actual product files
   - Include ALL target files that needed changes (discovered during debugging)
   - Add exact file paths and line numbers
   - Document any platform-specific workarounds (e.g., `.highPriorityGesture` for SwiftUI)
   - Include complete API response structures with correct field names

5. **Example Updates**:

   **Feature spec (`explore-posts/spec.md`)**:
   ```markdown
   **Navigate to Children**: Swipe left on a post with children to navigate to a view showing all its child posts.

   **Navigate Back**: Either tap the back button or swipe right anywhere in the child view to return to the parent view.
   ```

   **Pseudocode (`explore-posts/pseudocode.md`)**:
   ```markdown
   ## Gesture Handling

   **Swipe Left on Post with Children:**
   - Minimum distance: 30pt
   - Condition: Post must have children (childCount > 0)

   **Swipe Right in Child View:**
   - Minimum distance: 100pt
   - Start position: Anywhere in view (not just left edge)
   - Priority: High priority gesture to override ScrollView
   ```

   **Platform spec (`explore-posts/ios.md`)**:
   ```swift
   // Complete working code with exact measurements
   .gesture(
       DragGesture(minimumDistance: 30)
           .onEnded { value in
               if value.translation.width < -30 && (post.childCount ?? 0) > 0 {
                   onNavigateToChildren?(post.id)
               }
           }
   )

   // In ChildPostsView - swipe right from anywhere
   .highPriorityGesture(
       DragGesture()
           .onEnded { value in
               if value.translation.width > 100 {
                   navigationPath.removeLast()
               }
           }
   )
   ```

6. **Why This Matters**:
   - Next time miso runs, the documentation will generate complete, working code immediately
   - All debugging discoveries (exact thresholds, workarounds, edge cases) are preserved
   - Another developer can implement the feature correctly from the docs
   - If product code is deleted, specs can rebuild it without re-debugging
   - The implementation documentation becomes an accurate, tested source of truth

## State Tracking

Store the last run timestamp in `.claude/skills/miso/.last-run`:
- Before starting, read this file to get the baseline for comparison
- After successful completion, update it with the current timestamp
- If the file doesn't exist, compare against the last git commit

## Key Principles

1. **Incremental**: Only process features that have actually changed
2. **Chain of Trust**: Each level (pseudocode → platform → product) builds on the previous
3. **Minimal Edits**: Make targeted changes to existing code, don't rewrite unnecessarily
4. **Verify Visually**: For UI changes, take screenshots and iterate until the result matches the spec
5. **Learn from Failures**: Each visual verification failure reveals files that were missed
6. **Update Documentation**: Capture all discovered changes in implementation files so next time is complete
7. **Track State**: Remember what was last processed to avoid redundant work

## Example Workflow

User modifies `apps/firefly/features/background/spec.md` (changes color from turquoise to mauve):

1. **Detect**: `background/spec.md` changed since last run
2. **Update Pseudocode**: `apps/firefly/features/background/pseudocode.md` to reflect mauve color
3. **Update Platform Spec**: `apps/firefly/features/background/ios.md` with new RGB values
4. **Update Product Code**: Initial change to `ContentView.swift` with RGB(224, 176, 255)
5. **Build & Deploy**: `./install-device.sh`
6. **Visual Verify (Attempt 1)**:
   - Restart app, take screenshot
   - **FAILS**: Still shows turquoise
   - Investigation: App is showing PostsView, not ContentView!
7. **Fix & Rebuild**:
   - Update `PostsView.swift` with mauve color
   - Rebuild and redeploy
8. **Visual Verify (Attempt 2)**:
   - Take screenshot again
   - **SUCCESS**: Shows mauve background
9. **Search for Remaining Instances**:
   - `grep -r "Color(red: 64/255" NoobTest/`
   - Find 5 more files with old color
10. **Post-Debug Cleanup**:
    - Edit `background/spec.md`: Describe grey/dark-red colors as user sees them
    - Edit `background/pseudocode.md`: Add exact RGB values (128,128,128) and (139,0,0)
    - Edit `background/ios.md`: List all 6 target files with line numbers and complete code examples
    - Include search pattern: "Search for all instances of `Color(red:` and replace..."
11. **Test**: Run `./test-feature.sh background` if test exists
12. **Track**: Update `.last-run` timestamp

**Result**: The documentation now accurately reflects the final implementation. All 6 files are documented with exact values. Next time miso runs, it will update all 6 files on the first attempt, with no debugging needed.

## Important Notes

- Always read before writing - understand existing code structure
- Follow platform conventions (SwiftUI for iOS, Jetpack Compose for Android)
- Respect the JAVA_HOME requirement for Android builds
- Use LD="clang" for iOS builds to avoid Homebrew linker issues
- Check git status to understand what changed in the working directory
