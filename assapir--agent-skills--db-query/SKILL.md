# DB Query

Run read-only SQL queries against the Balance prod or sandbox PostgreSQL database. Credentials are fetched automatically from HashiCorp Vault using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var.

## Usage

```bash
bash /Users/asapir/.claude/skills/db-query/scripts/db_query.sh <sandbox|prod> "<SQL query>"
```

## Rules

- Default to **sandbox** unless the user explicitly says "prod" or "production"
- Before querying **prod**, warn the user and confirm they want prod
- Only run **SELECT** queries (credentials are read-only)
- For schema discovery, query `information_schema.tables` and `information_schema.columns`
- Present results in a clean, readable format (use markdown tables for small result sets)
- For large result sets, summarize key findings rather than dumping raw output

## Examples

```bash
# List tables
bash /Users/asapir/.claude/skills/db-query/scripts/db_query.sh sandbox "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public' ORDER BY table_name"

# Describe a table
bash /Users/asapir/.claude/skills/db-query/scripts/db_query.sh sandbox "SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='orders' ORDER BY ordinal_position"

# Query data
bash /Users/asapir/.claude/skills/db-query/scripts/db_query.sh sandbox "SELECT id, status, created_at FROM orders WHERE buyer_id = '123' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"GITHUB_TOKEN not set"**: The env var must be exported in the shell
- **"vault CLI not found"**: The script auto-installs via `brew install vault`
- **Permission denied on Vault**: The GitHub token may lack access to the requested environment
- **Connection timeout**: Check network/VPN connectivity to AWS RDS
