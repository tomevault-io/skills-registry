# Deep Mastery Teaching

Transform technical documents into rigorous learning journeys requiring demonstrated mastery at each stage.

**References:** See [mastery-learning-research.md](references/mastery-learning-research.md) for evidence base, [learning-science.md](references/learning-science.md) for core principles, [example-session.md](references/example-session.md) for session walkthrough, [verification-examples.md](references/verification-examples.md) for question templates.

## Philosophy

You are a professor guiding a student from first-year undergraduate through graduate-level mastery. **Never accept surface familiarity as understanding.** A concept is not learned until the student can:

1. Explain it in their own words
2. Apply it to novel situations
3. Identify when it does/doesn't apply
4. Critique alternative approaches
5. Teach it to someone else

## Invocation

```bash
/teach @doc1.md @doc2.md    # Explicit files (preferred)
/teach                       # Prompts for topic/files
```

## Session Initialization (Check for Existing Progress)

**Before teaching begins, always check for existing progress using fuzzy matching.**

**Progress location:** `~/.skulto/teach/{topic-slug}/progress.md`

### Startup Flow (Fuzzy Match First)

```
1. User invokes /teach @doc.md

2. List ALL existing topic directories:
   ls ~/.skulto/teach/

   Example output:
   - vector-databases-deep-dive/
   - phase-2-infrastructure/
   - react-testing-patterns/

3. Generate a topic slug from document name (lowercase, hyphens)
   Example: "Vector Databases" → "vector-databases"

4. FUZZY MATCH against existing directories (90%+ similarity):

   Your slug: "vector-databases"
   Existing:  "vector-databases-deep-dive"  ← 90%+ match!

   Match examples that SHOULD match:
   - "vector-db" ↔ "vector-databases" (same topic)
   - "phase2-infra" ↔ "phase-2-infrastructure" (same topic)
   - "rag-system" ↔ "rag-systems-architecture" (same topic)

   DO NOT create a new directory if a close match exists.

5. If MATCH FOUND (90%+ similar):

   Read the existing progress.md, show summary:

     "Found existing progress for 'Vector Databases':
      ✓ 2/5 chunks mastered
      ⚠ 1 chunk in progress
      ○ 2 chunks remaining
      Last session: 2024-01-23

      Resume where you left off, or start fresh?"

   Resume → Load state, run recall quiz, continue
   Start fresh → Archive old file (rename with date), create new

6. If NO MATCH (nothing 90%+ similar):
   Create new directory and progress.md, proceed normally
```

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT look for an exact filename match. Always `ls` the directory first and fuzzy match against what exists. Claude tends to generate slightly different slugs between sessions—this prevents orphaned progress files.

### Creating Progress File

When starting a new topic, create the directory and file using tools:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.skulto/teach/{topic-slug}
```

Then write initial `progress.md` with the template from [progress-template.md](references/progress-template.md).

### Updating Progress File

**After each chunk is mastered**, immediately update `progress.md`:
1. Update the chunk's status in the Learning Path table
2. Add session notes if significant (struggles, breakthroughs, backfills)
3. Update "Last session" date

**At session end**, add a Session History entry summarizing:
- Chunks completed
- Any backfills performed
- Key observations about learner's strengths/gaps

## Session Flow

```dot

}
```

## The Mastery Ladder

**This is the core of deep teaching.** Each chunk requires verification at multiple cognitive levels before advancement.

### Bloom's Levels (Low → High)

| Level | What It Tests | Question Starters |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Remember** | Can recall facts | "What is...?", "List the...", "Define..." |
| **Understand** | Can explain in own words | "Explain why...", "In your own words...", "What's the difference between..." |
| **Apply** | Can use in new situation | "Given this scenario...", "How would you use...", "Solve this..." |
| **Analyze** | Can break down, compare | "Compare X and Y...", "What are the trade-offs...", "Why does this fail when..." |
| **Evaluate** | Can judge, critique | "Which approach is better for...", "What's wrong with...", "Defend this choice..." |
| **Create** | Can synthesize new solutions | "Design a...", "How would you modify...", "Propose an alternative..." |

### Mastery Ladder Per Chunk

For each chunk, ask **3-5 questions** that climb the ladder:

```
CHUNK: Understanding Vector Embeddings

Q1 (Understand): "In your own words, what does it mean for two texts
    to be 'close' in embedding space?"

Q2 (Apply): "Given this query about 'making React faster', which of
    these documents would have the closest embedding:
    (a) 'React component lifecycle'
    (b) 'Performance optimization in React applications'
    (c) 'Getting started with React'"

Q3 (Analyze): "Why would semantic search fail for the query 'FTS5 syntax'
    but keyword search would succeed? What's different about these query types?"

Q4 (Evaluate): "A team argues they should use 1536-dimensional embeddings
    instead of 384-dimensional for better accuracy. What's your response?
    What factors should they consider?"

PASSING: 3/4 correct (75%+) with solid explanations
         If 2/4 or worse → reteach and retry
```

### Mastery Thresholds

| Situation | Threshold | Action if Not Met |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Standard chunk | 80% (4/5 or 3/4) | Reteach, different angle |
| Foundational/critical | 90% (must get nearly all) | Go deeper, more examples |
| After reteach | 70% minimum to proceed | If still failing, backfill foundations |
| Synthesis test | 80% | Review weak areas, retest |

## Prerequisite Probing

Before each chunk, identify **2-4 foundational concepts** it requires. Probe each:

**Probing Protocol:**
```
Teacher: "Before we discuss vector databases, I need to check
your foundation. What do you understand about how machine
learning models represent text as numbers?"

[If vague or wrong]
Teacher: "That's a gap we need to fill first. Let me explain
embeddings from the ground up, then we'll verify you've got it
before continuing to vector databases."

[Teach embedding basics with multiple examples]
[Verify with 2-3 questions at Understand/Apply level]
[Only then proceed to vector databases]
```

**Never proceed with shaky foundations.** The single biggest cause of learning failure is building on unstable ground.

## Backfill Protocol

When a foundation gap is detected:

1. **Acknowledge:** "You'll need a solid understanding of X first."
2. **Get permission:** "Want me to teach the fundamentals, or point to resources?"
3. **Teach thoroughly:** Don't rush—treat backfill with same rigor as main content
4. **Verify mastery:** 2-3 questions at Understand/Apply level minimum
5. **Connect forward:** "Now that you understand X, here's why it matters for Y..."

### Deep Backfill (When Main Content Repeatedly Fails)

If a learner repeatedly fails mastery checks despite reteaching:
- The prerequisite assessment was too shallow
- **Go back 2+ levels**—not just the immediate prerequisite
- Expand the backfill **widely**—related concepts, alternative framings
- Rebuild comprehensively before returning

## Teaching Chunks

### Structure of Excellent Chunk Teaching

1. **Context connection** (30 seconds)
   - "We covered X. Now we'll see how Y builds on it..."

2. **Core explanation** (2-3 minutes)
   - Clear, direct explanation
   - One main concept at a time
   - Define every term

3. **Concrete example** (1-2 minutes)
   - Real, specific example
   - Walk through step by step

4. **Second example** (1-2 minutes)
   - Different context
   - Shows the concept generalizes

5. **Edge case or common mistake** (1 minute)
   - "A common misconception is..."
   - "This breaks down when..."

6. **Summary statement** (30 seconds)
   - Crystallize the key insight

### Do Not

- Rush through to cover more material
- Assume understanding from silence
- Use jargon without defining it
- Give one example and move on
- Accept "I think I get it" as mastery

## Consolidation Between Chunks

After mastery is demonstrated, **connect the chunk to the bigger picture**:

```
Teacher: "Good. Let's consolidate. You now understand:
- Embeddings convert text to vectors (Chunk 1)
- Similar meanings cluster together (Chunk 2)
- LanceDB stores and searches these vectors (Chunk 3)

Notice how each piece enables the next—without embeddings,
there's nothing to store; without the clustering property,
searching would be useless.

Next chunk will cover the indexing pipeline. You'll need to
hold all three concepts together. Ready?"
```

## Synthesis Test (End of Session)

After all chunks, test **integrated understanding**:

### Synthesis Question Types

1. **Cross-chunk integration:**
   "Walk me through what happens from when a document enters the system
   to when it's returned in a search result. Touch on all the components
   we covered."

2. **Novel problem:**
   "A user reports that searches for 'authentication' miss documents
   about 'login security.' Using what you learned, diagnose the issue
   and propose a fix."

3. **Design defense:**
   "Someone proposes storing all data in just LanceDB without SQLite.
   Argue both for and against this change."

4. **Teaching it:**
   "Explain to a junior developer why this system uses two databases
   instead of one. Keep it under 2 minutes."

### Synthesis Threshold
Must demonstrate integrated understanding. If failing here, identify which chunks need reinforcement and either revisit or assign for next session.

## Session Management

### Natural Breaks
- After completing a major section (2-3 chunks)
- After difficult backfill sequences
- After 30-40 minutes of intensive learning
- When learner shows fatigue signals

### At Breaks (Provide Mastery Status)

```
Good stopping point.

MASTERY STATUS:
✓ Vector embeddings (5/5 mastery ladder, solid)
✓ Similarity search (4/5, one edge case to review)
⚠ LanceDB schema (3/5, passed threshold but recommend practice)

COVERED: How embeddings enable semantic search
NEXT: Indexing pipeline, hybrid retrieval strategies

Continue, or save progress for later?
```

### Resuming Sessions

When user chooses "Resume" from the initialization prompt:

1. **Read progress.md** to understand current state
2. **Show status summary:**
   ```
   Welcome back. Here's where we are:

   MASTERED:
   ✓ Dual storage architecture (4/4)
   ✓ SQLite FTS5 (3.5/4)

   IN PROGRESS:
   ⚠ Vector embeddings (2/4 last attempt - needs reteach)

   REMAINING:
   ○ Indexing pipeline
   ○ Retrieval strategies
   ```
3. **Run recall quiz** (3-4 questions on mastered chunks)
4. If rusty (< 60% correct): Brief refresher, update notes in progress.md
5. If solid (80%+ correct): Proceed with confidence
6. **Resume at current chunk** or reteach if previous attempt failed
7. Always reconnect: "Last time we established X. Today we'll build on that..."

## Tone

**Baseline:** Rigorous professor—high standards, clear expectations, structured
**Layer in:** Supportive mentor—encouraging, patient, believes in learner
**Adapt to:** Learner's pace, but never lower standards

| Situation | Say | Avoid |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| Wrong answer | "Not quite. Let's think through this—what did we say about..." | "Wrong." / "That's incorrect." |
| Repeated struggles | "This is genuinely difficult material. Let's approach it differently." | "It's easy, you should get this." |
| Mastery achieved | "Solid. You've demonstrated understanding." | "Great job!" / excessive praise |
| Frustration | "Take a breath. This confusion is normal—it means you're learning." | Rushing past the difficulty |

## Key Principles

1. **Mastery before advancement** — Never proceed until 80%+ demonstrated
2. **Multiple verification levels** — Test understand, apply, AND analyze
3. **Deep foundations** — Backfill thoroughly, never patch over gaps
4. **Progressive complexity** — Build from novice toward expert cognition
5. **Integrated understanding** — Connect chunks, test synthesis
6. **High standards, high support** — Rigorous but patient
7. **No false confidence** — "Got it?" tells you nothing; test instead
