# ASTRA Quick Reference Guide

Displays the guide for the relevant section based on `$ARGUMENTS`.
If no arguments are provided, displays the full summary.

## Full Summary (when no arguments)

```
ASTRA: AI-augmented Sprint Through Rapid Assembly
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VIP Principles:
  V - Vibe-driven Development (convey your intent)
  I - Instant Feedback Loop (hourly feedback)
  P - Plugin-powered Quality (quality is built into the code)

Sprint cycle: 1 week
Team composition: VA(1) + PE(1~2) + DE(1) + DSA(1) = 4~5 members
```

## Section-specific Guides

### sprint - Weekly Schedule

```
Monday:    Sprint Planning (1 hour) + Feature Build start
Tue-Thu:   Feature Build (AI code generation + human verification iteration)
Thursday:  Design Review (DSA inspection, afternoon)
Friday:    Code Review + Sprint Review + Retrospective
```

### review - Review Process

```
Design Review (1 hour - led by DSA):
  30 min: DSA inspects AI-generated UI (chrome-devtools)
  30 min: Fix design issues (PE modifies prompts → AI regenerates)

Code Review:
  /commit-push-pr        # Create PR
  /pr-merge       # Commit→review→fix→merge full cycle
  /code-review           # 5-agent parallel review
  /check-convention src/ # Coding standard check
  /check-naming src/entity/ # DB naming check
```

### release - Release Sprint

```
Step R.1: System Integration Testing
  /test-run                       Server launch + Chrome MCP integration testing
  - API integration testing
  - DB data consistency verification
  - Performance profiling
  - Cross-browser/responsive testing

Step R.2: Final Quality Gate (Gate 3)
  /code-review
  /check-convention src/
  /check-naming src/entity/

Step R.3: Deployment & Handover
  - Auto-generate operations manual
  - /clean_gone (branch cleanup)
```
