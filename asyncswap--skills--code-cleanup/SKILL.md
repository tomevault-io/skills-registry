# Solidity Code Cleanup

Fix code quality issues using live LSP diagnostics and LSP structural analysis. The Solidity Language Server continuously publishes diagnostics in `<new-diagnostics>` blocks as you read and edit files — this skill reads those diagnostics and applies fixes using LSP-guided refactoring.

## How it works

The Solidity Language Server publishes diagnostics automatically when files are read or edited. These appear as `<new-diagnostics>` blocks in the conversation with:
- **Code**: the lint rule (e.g., `screaming-snake-case-immutable`, `asm-keccak256`)
- **File**: file path
- **Line**: line number
- **Message**: description

This skill collects those diagnostics, categorizes them, and uses LSP operations (`findReferences`, `documentSymbol`, `goToDefinition`) to apply safe fixes across the codebase.

## Input

- `$ARGUMENTS` — Parse the arguments:
  - **file-path** (optional): Specific file to clean up. If omitted, fix all diagnostics visible in the current conversation.
  - **--fix** (optional): Apply fixes automatically for safe categories (naming, style). Safety and gas fixes are always presented as choices.
  - **--category** (optional): `naming`, `gas`, `safety`, `style`, `dead-code`, `all` (default).

## Phase 1: Collect Diagnostics

### Step 1: Gather current diagnostics

Check the conversation for all `<new-diagnostics>` blocks. Extract each diagnostic entry.

If no diagnostics are visible yet, read the target file(s) with the `Read` tool — the LSP will publish diagnostics as a side effect of opening the file.

If a specific file was given but not yet read, read it to trigger diagnostics.

### Step 2: Categorize

| Category | Lint Codes | Auto-fixable? |
|---|---|---|
| **naming** | `screaming-snake-case-immutable`, `screaming-snake-case-constant` | YES — mechanical rename via LSP findReferences |
| **gas** | `asm-keccak256`, `asm-mstore` | NO — present as suggestion |
| **safety** | `erc20-unchecked-transfer`, `divide-before-multiply` | NO — present options |
| **style** | `unwrapped-modifier-logic`, `unused-import` | YES — safe to apply |

## Phase 2: LSP Structural Analysis

### Step 3: Reference lookup for renames

For each **naming** diagnostic (e.g., `router` should be `ROUTER`):

1. Use `LSP findReferences` on the symbol at the flagged line and column
2. Collect ALL reference sites across all files (definition + every usage)
3. Verify the new name doesn't collide: `Grep` for the proposed name in the codebase
4. Generate Edit operations for the definition + every reference site
5. Apply edits starting from the last file/line to avoid offset shifts

### Step 4: Dead code detection

Use `LSP documentSymbol` on the target file(s) to list all functions. For each `internal` or `private` function:

1. `LSP findReferences` at the function definition line
2. Count references excluding the definition line itself
3. Zero external references = dead code candidate

**Only flag internal/private functions.** Public/external functions may be called by contracts outside the codebase.

### Step 5: Unused import detection

If `unused-import` diagnostics are present from the LSP, use them directly.

Otherwise, for each import in the file:
1. Extract the imported symbol name from the import statement
2. `Grep` for that symbol name in the file body (below the imports section)
3. Zero matches in the body = unused import

## Phase 3: Fix Application

### Step 6: Apply fixes by category

**Naming (auto-fix with --fix):**

1. Read the diagnostic message to determine the suggested name (e.g., `router` → `ROUTER`)
2. Use `LSP findReferences` to get every usage site across all files
3. Apply `Edit` with `replace_all` at each file, or targeted edits per reference
4. Read the file after editing to trigger fresh diagnostics — verify the naming diagnostic is gone

**Style (auto-fix with --fix):**

- `unused-import`: Read the file, identify the flagged import line, delete it with Edit
- `unwrapped-modifier-logic`: Read the modifier body, extract logic into an `_internal` function, replace modifier body with a call to it. Use `LSP findReferences` to check the new function name doesn't collide.

**Safety (always interactive — present options, do not auto-apply):**

- `erc20-unchecked-transfer`: Read the flagged line and surrounding context (5 lines). Present options:
  1. Wrap with return value check: `if (!token.transfer(...)) revert TRANSFER_FAILED()`
  2. Use SafeERC20: `token.safeTransfer(...)` (requires import)
  3. Use low-level call pattern (if the codebase already uses this elsewhere — check with Grep)
- Recommend the option that matches existing patterns in the codebase

**Gas (suggestion only — do not apply unless explicitly asked):**

- `asm-keccak256`: Read the flagged `keccak256(abi.encode(...))` expression. Show the inline assembly equivalent as a suggestion. Note the readability tradeoff.
- Present the suggestion but do NOT apply by default

### Step 7: Verify after fixes

After applying any edit:
1. Read the edited file to trigger fresh LSP diagnostics
2. Check that the fixed diagnostic no longer appears in the new `<new-diagnostics>` block
3. If new errors appear (e.g., compilation error from a bad rename), report and revert

## Output: Preview-Then-Apply Workflow

**Never apply fixes silently.** Always show the diff first, then apply only after presenting it.

### Step 1: Show the cleanup summary

```
## Code Cleanup — <file or directory>

| Category | Issues | Fixable | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| naming | 2 | 2 | `router` → `ROUTER`, ... |
| gas | 5 | 0 | keccak256 inline assembly |
| safety | 2 | 0 | unchecked ERC-20 transfer |
| style | 1 | 1 | unwrapped modifier logic |
| dead-code | 0 | — | — |
```

### Step 2: Present each fix as a diff BEFORE applying

For each fixable issue, read the file, construct the old and new strings, and present the change as a diff block in your text output:

```diff
 // File: AsyncSwap.sol:40
- AsyncRouter public immutable router;
+ AsyncRouter public immutable ROUTER;
```

```diff
 // File: AsyncSwap.sol:292
- router.executeSwap{value: msg.value}(
+ ROUTER.executeSwap{value: msg.value}(
```

```diff
 // File: AsyncSwap.sol:189
- router.withdrawNative(to, amount);
+ ROUTER.withdrawNative(to, amount);
```

For renames, list ALL reference sites from `LSP findReferences` so the user sees the full blast radius before any edits happen.

### Step 3: Apply with Edit tool

After presenting the diffs, apply each change using the `Edit` tool. The Edit tool shows its own diff to the user for approval. Apply changes one file at a time, starting from the bottom of each file (highest line number first) to avoid offset drift.

For cross-file renames:
1. Present ALL diffs across all files in one text block
2. Apply edits file by file — definition site first, then usage sites
3. After all edits, Read the files to trigger fresh LSP diagnostics
4. Confirm the diagnostic is resolved (no longer appears)

### Step 4: Present non-fixable issues as choices

For safety issues, present options with diffs for each:

```
erc20-unchecked-transfer — CurrencySettler.sol:18

Current:
  IERC20(token).transferFrom(payer, address(manager), amount);

Option A:
```diff
- IERC20(token).transferFrom(payer, address(manager), amount);
+ if (!IERC20(token).transferFrom(payer, address(manager), amount)) revert();
```

Option B:
```diff
+ import {SafeERC20} from "openzeppelin/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
  ...
- IERC20(token).transferFrom(payer, address(manager), amount);
+ SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(IERC20(token), payer, address(manager), amount);
```

Option C: Keep as-is (codebase uses low-level .call() pattern elsewhere)
```

For gas suggestions, show the before/after but mark as optional:

```
asm-keccak256 — AsyncSwap.sol:537 (×5 instances)

```diff
- bytes32 orderId = keccak256(abi.encode(order));
+ bytes32 orderId;
+ assembly {
+     let ptr := mload(0x40)
+     mstore(ptr, mload(order))
+     mstore(add(ptr, 0x20), mload(add(order, 0x20)))
+     mstore(add(ptr, 0x40), mload(add(order, 0x40)))
+     orderId := keccak256(ptr, 0x60)
+ }
```

Saves ~30 gas per call. Reduces readability. Apply only if gas is a priority.
```

### Step 5: Verify

After all edits, Read each modified file. Check:
- The fixed diagnostic no longer appears in `<new-diagnostics>`
- No new error diagnostics were introduced
- If a new error appears, show it and offer to revert

## Reactive Mode

This skill works best reactively during development:

1. User writes or edits Solidity code
2. LSP publishes diagnostics in `<new-diagnostics>`
3. User says "fix those warnings" or "clean up"
4. Skill reads the diagnostics from conversation context
5. Presents diffs for each fix
6. Applies via Edit tool (user sees each change for approval)
7. Reads files after to verify diagnostics are resolved
