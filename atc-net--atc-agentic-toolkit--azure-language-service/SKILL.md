# Azure Language Service Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for Azure Language Service. Covers troubleshooting, best practices, decision making, architecture & design patterns, limits & quotas, security, configuration, integrations & coding patterns, and deployment. It combines local quick-reference content with remote documentation fetching capabilities.

## How to Use This Skill

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: This file may be large. Use the **Category Index** below to locate relevant sections, then use `read_file` with specific line ranges (e.g., `L136-L144`) to read the sections needed for the user's question
This skill requires **network access** to fetch documentation content.
Use `mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch` to retrieve full articles.
- **Fallback**: Use the built-in `WebFetch` tool if the Microsoft Learn MCP server is not available.
