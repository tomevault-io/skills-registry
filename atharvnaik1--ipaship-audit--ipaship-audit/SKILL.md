# ipaShip — ipaship-audit
Audit your iOS/Android app packages against official store policies before submission. Upload `.ipa` or `.apk` files and get a structured compliance report with guideline references, severity ratings, and actionable fixes.

## When to Use

- Before submitting an iOS app to the **Apple App Store** — catch rejections early
- Before submitting an Android app to **Google Play** — identify policy violations
- During CI/CD to automate pre-submission compliance checks
- When reviewing third-party apps for compliance risks
- As part of a code review workflow for mobile apps

## Setup

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Account | [ipaship.com](https://ipaship.com) — free to use |
| API Key | Get yours at [ipaship.com](https://ipaship.com) |
| App Package | `.ipa` (iOS), `.apk` (Android), or `.zip` file (max 150MB) |
| Dependencies | The server needs `unzip` installed |

### Environment Variables

```bash
export IPASHIP_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Usage

### 1. Web Interface (No Code Required)

1. Go to [ipaship.com](https://ipaship.com)
2. Upload your `.ipa` or `.apk` file
3. Select your AI provider (Claude, GPT, Gemini, or OpenRouter)
4. Click "Audit" and wait for the streaming report

### 2. CLI via cURL

```bash
# Basic audit with default provider (Anthropic Claude)
curl -X POST https://ipaship.com/api/audit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $IPASHIP_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your-app.ipa" \
  -F "provider=anthropic" \
  -F "model=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

# With context about your app
curl -X POST https://ipaship.com/api/audit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $IPASHIP_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your-app.ipa" \
  -F "provider=anthropic" \
  -F "model=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" \
  -F "context=This is a social media app with user-generated content"

# Using OpenAI
curl -X POST https://ipaship.com/api/audit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $IPASHIP_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your-app.apk" \
  -F "provider=openai" \
  -F "model=gpt-4o"
```

### 3. Python Wrapper

```python
# wrappers/python/ipaship.py
from ipaship import audit_app

result = audit_app(
    file_path="build/YourApp.ipa",
    provider="anthropic",
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    api_key="your-key"
)
print(result)
```

### 4. Programmatic — All Language Wrappers

The repo ships wrappers in 15+ languages under `wrappers/`:

| Language | Path | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Python | `wrappers/python/ipaship.py` | ✅ |
| Node.js | `wrappers/npm/index.js` | ✅ |
| Go | `wrappers/go/ipaship.go` | ✅ |
| Rust | `wrappers/rust/src/main.rs` | ✅ |
| Ruby | `wrappers/ruby/lib/ipaship.rb` | ✅ |
| Java | `wrappers/java/` | ✅ |
| Kotlin | `wrappers/kotlin/` | ✅ |
| Swift | `wrappers/swift-cocoapods/` | ✅ |
| Flutter/Dart | `wrappers/flutter-dart/` | ✅ |
| PHP | `wrappers/php/` | ✅ |
| C++ | `wrappers/cpp/` | ✅ |
| C# (.NET) | `wrappers/csharp-dotnet/` | ✅ |
| R | `wrappers/r/` | ✅ |
| Expo | `wrappers/expo/` | ✅ |
| Homebrew | `wrappers/homebrew/` | ✅ |

## Features

### Supported AI Providers

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| **Anthropic** | Claude Sonnet 4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini |
| **Google Gemini** | Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.0 Pro |
| **OpenRouter** | Any model (e.g., `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`) |
| **ipaShip (NVIDIA)** | Llama 3.1 405B, NVIDIA NIM models |

### Audit Report Structure

Every report includes:

1. **Executive Summary** — What the app does (from code analysis)
2. **Dashboard** — Risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), readiness score, issue counts
3. **Phase 1: Policy Compliance** — Per-guideline checks with PASS/WARN/FAIL
4. **Phase 2: Remediation Plan** — Prioritized fix table with file references
5. **Submission Readiness** — Go/no-go verdict with score

### Key Capabilities

- **Multi-provider AI** — Choose your preferred LLM backend
- **Real-time streaming** — Watch the audit generate live
- **IPA & APK support** — Both iOS and Android
- **Export** — Download as Markdown or PDF
- **Zero-trust** — Files deleted after analysis, API keys stay client-side
- **Rate limited** — 5 requests/minute per client (DDoS protection)

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting `unzip`** — The server needs `unzip` installed to extract packages. If you see extraction errors, install it: `sudo apt-get install unzip`.
2. **File too large** — Maximum upload size is 150MB. For larger apps, trim the .ipa/.apk first.
3. **No source files found** — Ensure your app package isn't encrypted or DRM-protected. The auditor only analyzes readable source code (`.swift`, `.java`, `.kt`, etc.).
4. **API key in the wrong place** — The server uses `NVIDIA_KEY` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` env vars for the backend. For BYOK (bring your own key), pass it in the upload form.
5. **Binary-only apps** — Apps compiled without source code (e.g., Unity builds with only IL2CPP binaries) will have few files to analyze. The audit quality depends on available source.

## Verification

After setting up:

1. Deploy the app locally: `npm run dev`
2. Upload a test `.ipa` or use the cURL command above
3. Verify you get a streaming JSON response starting with `{"type":"meta","filesScanned":N}`
4. Check that the final report includes both Phase 1 (compliance checks) and Phase 2 (remediation plan)
5. Test with different providers by changing the `provider` field
