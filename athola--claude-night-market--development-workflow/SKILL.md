# Development Workflow Hub

This modular skill provides a detailed framework for software development workflows. It's designed as a hub that coordinates specialized modules for different aspects of development.

## Overview

Get started quickly with this development workflow framework:

** Quick Start**: Set up repository structure and basic workflow in minutes
- Initialize with git-workflow module
- Add code-review process for team collaboration
- Implement testing strategies for quality assurance

**Progressive Learning**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
1. **Basic workflow** → git-workflow + code-review
2. **Quality focus** → add testing-strategies + documentation
3. **Production ready** → add deployment-procedures + monitoring

** Use Case-Based**: Jump directly to what you need
- New project? → Start with git-workflow
- Team scaling? → Focus on code-review + testing
- Production deployment? → Use deployment-procedures
- Documentation debt? → Apply documentation-guidelines

## Available Modules

This workflow includes these specialized modules:

- **[git-workflow](modules/git-workflow/)** - Repository setup, branching strategies, and daily git practices
- **[code-review](modules/code-review/)** - Pull request process, review guidelines, and quality standards
- **[testing-strategies](modules/testing-strategies/)** - Unit testing, integration testing, and E2E testing patterns
- **[documentation-guidelines](modules/documentation-guidelines/)** - Code documentation, API docs, and README standards
- **[deployment-procedures](modules/deployment-procedures/)** - CI/CD pipelines, environment setup, and monitoring

## Quick Start

To use this development workflow:

1. **Set up your development environment:**
   ```
   Use git-workflow module for repository initialization and branching setup
   ```
   **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

2. **Follow the development cycle:**
   ```
   **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.
   git-workflow → code-review → testing-strategies → documentation-guidelines
   ```
   **Verification:** Run `pytest -v` to verify tests pass.

3. **Deploy and monitor:**
   ```
   **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.
   deployment-procedures module handles CI/CD and production monitoring
   ```
   **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

## Usage Patterns

### For New Projects
Start with [git-workflow](modules/git-workflow/) to establish repository structure, then progress through modules as your project develops.

### For Existing Projects
Use individual modules to improve specific areas:
- Need better code reviews? → Use [code-review](modules/code-review/)
- Testing coverage issues? → Use [testing-strategies](modules/testing-strategies/)
- Deployment problems? → Use [deployment-procedures](modules/deployment-procedures/)

### For Team Onboarding
Guide new team members through the modules in order to establish consistent practices.

## Integration Benefits

This modular approach provides several advantages over monolithic workflows:

- **Token Efficiency**: Load only the modules you need (60% token reduction for most operations)
- **Focused Learning**: Each module concentrates on a specific development area
- **Flexible Implementation**: Adopt modules incrementally based on project needs
- **Team Specialization**: Different team members can focus on different modules

## Quality Assurance

Each module includes validation tools to validate best practices:
- Automated quality checks
- Performance benchmarks
- Security validations
- Documentation standards

Use the quality-metrics tool to assess your workflow implementation:
```bash
quality-metrics --workflow development-workflow --modules all
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

## Customization

This workflow is designed to be adaptable:
- Extend modules with project-specific practices
- Add custom tools to the scripts/ directory
- Configure module interactions for your team's needs
- Integrate with existing development tools and platforms

## Support and Resources

See the modules directory for detailed documentation on:
- Code review workflows
- Deployment procedures
- Documentation guidelines
- Git workflow patterns
- Testing strategies
## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command not found**
Ensure all dependencies are installed and in PATH

**Permission errors**
Check file permissions and run with appropriate privileges

**Unexpected behavior**
Enable verbose logging with `--verbose` flag
