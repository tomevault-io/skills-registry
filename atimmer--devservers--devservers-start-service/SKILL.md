# Devservers Start Service

## Overview

Start, restart, or stop a configured service using the CLI.
Rule: Use CLI only. Do not edit config files directly or interact with internal services.

## Workflow

Quick overview of available CLI commands:

```
devservers --help
```

### 1) Start or restart the service

```
devservers start <name>
```

Restart if already running:

```
devservers restart <name>
```

### 2) Stop a service (optional)

```
devservers stop <name>
```

### 3) Verify status

```
devservers status
```

The status output includes the current port when known (e.g. `service: running (port 3000)`).
For `detect` or `registry` modes, the port appears once it is discovered/assigned.

### 4) Get the full local URL

```
devservers url <name>
```

## Notes

- If a CLI call fails due to connectivity, ask the user to start the manager and retry.
