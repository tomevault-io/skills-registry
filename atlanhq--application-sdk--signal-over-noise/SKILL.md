# Skill: `/signal-over-noise`

A two-phase Python observability audit that improves the ratio of meaningful signal to noise
in your error handling and logging. Each phase analyzes the codebase, presents a remediation
plan for your review, and — after approval — executes the fixes.

- **`--mode surface` (default):** uncovers suppressed exceptions that make failures invisible
- **`--mode tune`:** fixes logging anti-patterns that pollute or obscure your log stream

## Invocation

```
/signal-over-noise                                      # surface audit, current directory
/signal-over-noise packages/app-framework/src           # surface audit, specific path
/signal-over-noise --mode surface                       # same as default
/signal-over-noise --mode tune                          # logging quality audit
/signal-over-noise --mode tune --severity high          # HIGH + CRITICAL findings only
/signal-over-noise --mode surface packages/foo/src      # surface audit, specific path
```

**Argument parsing:**
- First positional token (not a flag): target path. Default: `.`
- `--mode surface|tune`: which phase to run. Default: `surface`
- `--severity <level>`: filter findings; levels: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `all`. Default: `all`

---

## How each mode works

Both modes follow the same two-stage structure:

1. **Analysis** — grep the codebase, read context, classify findings, build a remediation plan.
   Enter plan mode and present the plan for user review. The user can iterate on the plan.

2. **Execution** — after the user approves the plan, apply the agreed fixes. Run pre-commit on
   changed files. Leave all changes uncommitted for the user to review before committing.

---

## Mode: surface

Finds every pattern where exceptions are caught and silently discarded, converting failures
into invisible state.

> **Detection is now delegated to the conformance suite (E-series).** The E001–E018 checks
> run deterministically via `uv run atlan-application-sdk-conformance detect --repo . --series E`
> and produce SARIF output with one finding per rule violation. This skill retains its value
> for the **remediation / fix-authoring** pass (Stage 2) — the suite deliberately does not
> apply fixes. For a quick detection-only scan, prefer the suite runner; use this skill when
> you want a plan-mode review and automated fix application.

Pattern catalogue, severity criteria, fix templates, and linting rules are in:

`.claude/skills/signal-over-noise/references/error-recovery-patterns.md`

---

### Stage 1 — Analysis

#### Step 1.1 — Setup

1. Read `.claude/skills/signal-over-noise/references/error-recovery-patterns.md` in full.
2. Read `.claude/skills/signal-over-noise/references/typed-error-prescription.md` in full.
3. Resolve `TARGET_PATH` from arguments (default: current directory). Confirm it exists.
4. Set `SEVERITY_FILTER` from `--severity` (default: `all`).

#### Step 1.2 — Pattern Detection

Run all 13 grep searches in parallel against `TARGET_PATH` (`*.py` files only):

| # | Pattern ID | Grep |
|---|------------|------|
| 1 | P1 | `except\s*:\s*pass` |
| 2 | P2 | `except\s+\w.*:\s*pass` |
| 3 | P3 | `contextlib\.suppress\(` |
| 4 | P4 | `except\s+(Exception\|BaseException)\s*:` |
| 5 | P5 | `logger\.(warning\|error\|critical)\(` inside except blocks — collect hits for Step 1.3 |
| 6 | P6 | `^\s*except\s*:` |
| 7 | P7 | except block with `return` and no log — collect hits for Step 1.3 |
| 8 | P8 | `except\s+ImportError` |
| 9 | P9 | except block with only an assignment — collect hits for Step 1.3 |
| 10 | P10 | `return_exceptions=True` |
| 11 | P11 | `class\s+\w+.*logging\.Filter` or `def filter\(self` inside a Filter subclass |
| 12 | P12 | `raise\s+(ValueError\|RuntimeError\|Exception\|TypeError\|NotImplementedError\|OSError\|KeyError\|LookupError)\b` |
| 13 | P13 | `raise\s+(ClientError\|ApiError\|OrchestratorError\|WorkflowError\|IOError\|CommonError\|DocGenError\|ActivityError\|AtlanError)\b` |

For P5, P7, P9, P11, P12, P13: raw grep over-matches. Collect `file:line` hits and read context in Step 1.3.
P13 context note: `IOError` is also a Python builtin alias for `OSError` — confirm the hit imports from `application_sdk.common.error_codes` before classifying as legacy. Bare `AtlanError` raises (no constant) require litmus-test classification (§3 of `typed-error-prescription.md`).

Collect all hits as a flat list: `(file, line_number, pattern_id, raw_snippet)`.

#### Step 1.3 — Context Reading and Classification

For each hit, read 10–15 lines of surrounding context.

Classify each finding:
- **Severity:** CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW (from §Severity Classification in reference)
- **Legitimacy:** `genuine-bug` or `acceptable` (from §Legitimacy in reference)
- **Category:** `silent-swallow`, `missing-traceback`, `overly-broad-catch`,
  `error-to-return-value`, `suppress-operational`, `optional-import`,
  `asyncio-unexamined`, `untyped-raise`, `legacy-raise`
- **Typed-error prescription:** for every `genuine-bug` finding whose fix involves
  a `raise` (FT-1b, FT-3b, FT-5b, FT-8, FT-9), look up the prescribed leaf and
  code from `references/typed-error-prescription.md`. Record as `Prescribed:` on
  the remediation entry so the user sees the target class in the plan.

Apply `SEVERITY_FILTER`: discard findings below the threshold before proceeding.

P12 classification notes:
- Inside `__post_init__`, stdlib dataclass validators, or Pydantic `@field_validator` / `@validator` methods: check for a comment
  explaining the stdlib-interop need. If present → `acceptable`. If absent →
  flag as `genuine-bug` (MEDIUM — add the comment).
- Inside an `@task`-decorated activity body or `@activity.defn`-decorated function → escalate to CRITICAL.

P13: confirmed hits are `genuine-bug` (HIGH). After context reading (see over-matches note above), use the §5 migration table from
`typed-error-prescription.md` for the `Prescribed:` field. When no matching legacy constant is present, use §3 litmus tests to select a leaf directly.

#### Step 1.4 — Build Remediation Plan

For each `genuine-bug` finding, produce a remediation entry. Include `Prescribed:`
whenever the fix involves raising an exception:

```
File:     application_sdk/clients/sql.py:352
Severity: HIGH
Category: untyped-raise
Pattern:  P12
Current:
    raise ValueError("Engine is not initialized. Call load() first.")
Prescribed:
    EngineNotInitializedError(InternalError)  →  code=INTERNAL_ENGINE_NOT_INITIALIZED
    Subclass bakes message + component + invariant. Place in a sibling
    module (e.g. _<area>_errors.py); see typed-error-prescription.md §4.
Fix (FT-8):
    raise EngineNotInitializedError()
Auto-fixable: no  (leaf + subclass choice needs context — manual review)
Priority: P1
```

For existing-pattern (P1–P11) findings whose fix re-raises, also include
`Prescribed:` with the leaf selected from `typed-error-prescription.md` §4.

Priority mapping:
- **P0** — CRITICAL: fix immediately, block merges
- **P1** — HIGH: fix in current sprint
- **P2** — MEDIUM/LOW: fix when touching the file

#### Step 1.5 — Enter Plan Mode

Call `EnterPlanMode`.

Present the Surface Report as the plan:

```markdown
# Surface Report — <TARGET_PATH>

## Executive Summary
- Files scanned: N
- Total findings: N (N genuine bugs, N acceptable patterns)
- By severity: CRITICAL: N | HIGH: N | MEDIUM: N | LOW: N
- By category: silent-swallow: N | missing-traceback: N | ...
- Auto-fixable: N | Needs manual review: N

## Findings
| # | File | Line | Severity | Category | Pattern | Auto-fixable | Notes |
|---|------|------|----------|----------|---------|--------------|-------|

## Remediation Plan

### P0 — Fix Immediately (CRITICAL)
[entries]

### P1 — Fix This Sprint (HIGH)
[entries]

### P2 — Fix When Touching (MEDIUM/LOW)
[entries]

## Acceptable Patterns (no action required)
| File | Line | Pattern | Justification |
|------|------|---------|---------------|
```

Call `ExitPlanMode` to request user approval. Wait for approval before proceeding to Stage 2.

---

### Stage 2 — Execution (after plan approval)

Apply the remediation plan that was approved. Only fix what was listed in the approved plan.

#### Auto-fixable patterns — apply directly:
- **FT-1a:** Add logging to silent-swallow (log-and-continue, best-effort paths)
- **FT-2:** Add `exc_info=True` to existing log call in except block
- **FT-3a:** Add logging before error-to-return-value (when caller treats default as valid)
- **FT-4:** Add exception inspection after `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)`
- **FT-5a:** Replace broad `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` with logged try/except (best-effort)

#### Manual review required — leave TODO comments:
- **FT-1b** (log + typed re-raise): leaf choice is contextual
- **FT-3b** (convert swallow to typed raise): default for error-to-return-value when caller trusts result
- **FT-5b** (typed re-raise for non-best-effort suppress): leaf choice is contextual
- **FT-6** (narrow broad catch): `# TODO(signal-over-noise): [P4] narrow this catch`
- **FT-7** (Filter exception safety): `# TODO(signal-over-noise): [P11] wrap filter body in try/except`
- **FT-8** (convert untyped builtin raise to typed `AppError`): leaf from `typed-error-prescription.md` §4. Define a subclass for each distinct failure mode in a sibling errors module (SDK: `application_sdk/<area>/errors.py` or `_<area>_errors.py`; app: `app/failures.py`). Bake `message` and evidence-field defaults when they're stable across raise sites; for one-off sites, the subclass may just override `code` and let the raise site pass `message`.
- **FT-9** (convert legacy `AtlanError` raise to typed `AppError`): leaf from `typed-error-prescription.md` §5. Same subclassing rule applies when the same error recurs.

TODO comment format for swallow/logging findings:
```python
# TODO(signal-over-noise): [P2] silent swallow — add logging. See references/error-recovery-patterns.md#P2
```

TODO comment format for untyped/legacy raise findings — include the prescribed leaf:
```python
# TODO(signal-over-noise): [P12] convert to typed AppError. Leaf: InternalError (wire code: INTERNAL_ENGINE_NOT_INITIALIZED). See typed-error-prescription.md §4
# TODO(signal-over-noise): [P13] legacy AtlanError — migrate to DependencyUnavailableError. See typed-error-prescription.md §5
```

#### After applying fixes:

Run pre-commit on every file that was changed:
```bash
uv run pre-commit run --files <file1> <file2> ...
```

If pre-commit is not available, skip this step (do not fail).

Leave all changes **uncommitted** — the user reviews before committing.

#### Finish

Report a brief summary: N files changed, N auto-fixes applied, N TODO comments added.

Then recommend the next step:

> **Next:** Run `/signal-over-noise --mode tune` to audit logging quality (f-strings, missing `exc_info`, log levels, credential leaks, and more).

---

## Mode: tune

Finds logging anti-patterns that pollute your log stream, obscure structured fields, or create
security risks.

Pattern catalogue, severity criteria, fix templates, and linting rules are in:

- `.claude/skills/signal-over-noise/references/logging-patterns.md` — detectable patterns (L1–L23)
- `.claude/skills/signal-over-noise/references/logging-level-guidelines.md` — level philosophy and framework awareness notes

---

### Stage 1 — Analysis

#### Step 2.1 — Setup and Discovery

1. Read both reference files listed above in full.
2. Resolve `TARGET_PATH` from arguments (default: current directory). Confirm it exists.
3. Set `SEVERITY_FILTER` from `--severity` (default: `all`).

**Discover the project's logging framework** — do not assume any specific one:

Grep for common logger factory patterns and count occurrences:
- `structlog\.get_logger\(`
- `logging\.getLogger\(`
- `loguru` (import or usage)
- `get_logger\(` (custom wrapper)

The factory with the highest count is `CANONICAL_FACTORY`.

Check `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` / `uv.lock` for logging framework dependencies:
- `structlog` in deps → `LOGGER_FRAMEWORK = structlog`
- `loguru` in deps → `LOGGER_FRAMEWORK = loguru`
- Neither → `LOGGER_FRAMEWORK = stdlib`

Determine `SUPPORTS_KWARGS`:
- structlog or loguru: `SUPPORTS_KWARGS = true`
- stdlib: `SUPPORTS_KWARGS = false`

**Determine `FRAMEWORK_SPECIFIC_PATTERNS`** — which additional patterns (L13–L23) to run:
- stdlib: L13, L14, L16, L17, L20, L23
- structlog: L15, L19
- loguru: L19, L21, L22
- All frameworks: L18

**Discover logger variable names** — grep for assignments:
```
logger\s*=\s*
log\s*=\s*
_logger\s*=\s*
_log\s*=\s*
```

Collect distinct prefixes (e.g. `logger`, `log`, `_logger`). Build `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN` by
joining them: `(logger|log|_logger|_log)\.` — use this in all Step 2.2 greps.

#### Step 2.2 — Pattern Detection

Run the universal patterns (L1–L12) plus `FRAMEWORK_SPECIFIC_PATTERNS` (L13–L23) in parallel
against `TARGET_PATH`. Use `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN` in place of hardcoded `logger\.` in each pattern.

**Universal patterns (all frameworks):**

| Pattern | Grep | Type |
|---------|------|------|
| L1 f-string | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.\w+\(f["']` | mechanical |
| L2 inconsistent factory | Files not using `CANONICAL_FACTORY` | mechanical |
| L3 `extra={}` | `extra=\{` near a logger call | heuristic |
| L4 missing exc_info | multiline: `except` + log call without `exc_info` | heuristic |
| L5 print() | `^\s*print\(` (exclude test files, CLI scripts) | mechanical |
| L6 INFO in loop | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.info\(` inside for/while | heuristic |
| L7 critical() | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.critical\(` | mechanical |
| L8 expensive debug | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.debug\(.*(?:json\.dumps\|repr\|\.to_dict\|\.model_dump)` | heuristic |
| L9 warn-then-raise | multiline: log call within 3 lines before `raise` | heuristic |
| L10 credential in log | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.\w+\(.*(?:password\|secret\|token\|api_key\|credential\|bearer\|private_key)` (case-insensitive) | heuristic |
| L11 concatenation | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.\w+\(["'].*["']\s*\+` | mechanical |
| L12 %-style (non-stdlib only) | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.\w+\(["'].*%[sdfr]` — skip if `LOGGER_FRAMEWORK == stdlib` | heuristic |
| L18 exception() outside except | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.exception\(` | heuristic |
| L24 kwargs in application log calls | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.\w+\([^)]*,\s*\w+=` (non-stdlib only) — collect hits for Step 2.3 | heuristic |

**Framework-specific patterns (run only for the indicated framework):**

| Pattern | Grep | Framework | Type |
|---------|------|-----------|------|
| L13 extra reserved key | `extra=\{` — check keys against 22 reserved list | stdlib | heuristic |
| L14 arbitrary kwargs | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.\w+\([^)]*,\s*\w+=` | stdlib | heuristic |
| L15 event= kwarg | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.\w+\(.*event=` | structlog | mechanical |
| L16 dictConfig disable_existing | `dictConfig\(` | stdlib | heuristic |
| L17 basicConfig no-op | `basicConfig\(` (collect all across codebase) | stdlib | heuristic |
| L19 bind() discarded | `^\s+\w+\.bind\(` as bare statement | structlog/loguru | heuristic |
| L20 propagate=False | `propagate\s*=\s*False` | stdlib | heuristic |
| L21 logger.remove() | `logger\.remove\(\s*\)` (no args) | loguru | mechanical |
| L22 loguru kwargs as format | `LOGGER_VAR_PATTERN\.\w+\("[^"]*"[^)]*,\s*\w+=` | loguru | heuristic |
| L23 warn() deprecated | `\.warn\(` | stdlib | mechanical |

For **heuristic patterns**: collect `file:line` hits for Step 2.3 context reading.

For **mechanical patterns** (L1, L2, L5, L7, L11, L15, L21, L23): record directly as findings.

#### Step 2.3 — Context Reading and Classification

For each heuristic hit, read 10–15 lines of surrounding context.

Classify each hit:
- **Severity:** apply the severity from the pattern catalogue, adjusted by context
- **Legitimacy:** genuine finding or acceptable pattern (see §Legitimacy in `logging-patterns.md`)

**Universal framework adjustments:**
- L3: if `LOGGER_FRAMEWORK == stdlib` → ACCEPTABLE. If structlog/loguru → MEDIUM. Fix direction: %-style message body, not "unwrap to kwargs".
- L12: if `LOGGER_FRAMEWORK == stdlib` → ACCEPTABLE. If the log call goes through `CANONICAL_FACTORY` (e.g. `get_logger()`) AND that factory has a %-style bridge (look for `_format_printf_args` or similar in the adapter) → ACCEPTABLE. If the log call uses a direct loguru import (`from loguru import logger` / `loguru.logger`) even when a bridge adapter exists → HIGH (the bridge is bypassed; positional args are silently dropped because loguru uses `str.format()` not `%`). If vanilla loguru (no bridge) → HIGH. If vanilla structlog → MEDIUM.
- L10: read context — `token_name=name` is acceptable; `token=value` is CRITICAL.
- L6: if loop is clearly bounded to ≤10 items → ACCEPTABLE.
- L18: read 5 lines before the `.exception()` call — if inside an `except` block → ACCEPTABLE.
- L24: skip `exc_info=True/False`. Skip files that define the logging factory/adapter (the file containing `get_logger` or the logger adapter class). Flag all other kwargs as MEDIUM.

**Framework-specific classification rules:**
- L13: Read the `extra={}` dict literal. Flag CRITICAL for each key that matches any of the 22 reserved LogRecord attributes. Keys not in the reserved list → ACCEPTABLE.
- L14: Read the log call kwargs. Flag CRITICAL for any kwarg not in `{exc_info, extra, stack_info, stacklevel}`. Do NOT flag structlog or loguru projects.
- L16: Check the config dict passed to `dictConfig()`. If `"disable_existing_loggers"` is absent or `True` → HIGH. If `False` → ACCEPTABLE.
- L17: Collect all `basicConfig()` calls across the codebase. If more than one → flag the second+ as HIGH. Single call in `if __name__ == "__main__":` → ACCEPTABLE.
- L19: Check if the `.bind()` call is a bare statement (result not assigned) → HIGH. If assigned (`x = logger.bind(...)`) → ACCEPTABLE.
- L20: Read 10 lines around `propagate = False`. Check if `addHandler()` is called on the same logger. If no handler → HIGH. If handler present → ACCEPTABLE.
- L22: Read the message string. If any kwarg name has no matching `{kwarg_name}` placeholder in the message → MEDIUM. If all kwargs have placeholders → ACCEPTABLE (used for formatting).

Apply `SEVERITY_FILTER`: drop findings below the threshold.

#### Step 2.4 — Build Remediation Plan

For each genuine finding, produce an entry:
- **Location:** `file:line`
- **Severity:** CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- **Category:** L1–L23 code + name
- **Current code:** offending lines
- **Fix template:** reference to FT-L1 through FT-L23 from `logging-patterns.md`
- **Auto-fixable:** yes/no

Group into priority tiers:
- **P0** — Fix Immediately: CRITICAL — L10 (credential leak), L13 (reserved key crash), L14 (stdlib kwargs crash)
- **P1** — Fix This Sprint: HIGH — L1, L2, L4, L15, L16, L17, L19, L20, L21
- **P2** — Fix When Touching File: MEDIUM/LOW — L3, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9, L11, L12, L18, L22, L23, L24

Also compute linting recommendations: read `pyproject.toml` for existing ruff or flake8 rule
selections. List any missing rules from §Linting Rules in `logging-patterns.md`:
- G001, G003, G004, T201, LOG009 — recommend if not present
- G002 — do NOT recommend (%-style is the preferred formatting; G002 would produce false positives)
- LOG015 — recommend if stdlib and ruff version supports it

Include the minimal `pyproject.toml` diff and suggested `lint-logging` Makefile target in the plan.

#### Step 2.5 — Enter Plan Mode

Call `EnterPlanMode`.

Present the Tune Report as the plan:

```markdown
# Tune Report — <TARGET_PATH>

## Project Logging Profile
- Framework: <LOGGER_FRAMEWORK>
- Canonical factory: <CANONICAL_FACTORY>
- Supports kwargs: <yes/no>
- Logger variable names found: logger, log, ...

## Executive Summary
- Files scanned: N
- Total hits: N (N genuine findings, N acceptable patterns)
- By severity: CRITICAL: N | HIGH: N | MEDIUM: N | LOW: N
- Auto-fixable: N | Needs manual review: N

## Logger Consistency
- Files using canonical factory: N
- Files using non-canonical factory: N (list)

## Findings
| # | File | Line | Severity | Pattern | Auto-fixable | Notes |
|---|------|------|----------|---------|--------------|-------|

## Remediation Plan

### P0 — Fix Immediately (CRITICAL)
[L10, L13, L14 findings with exact lines and fix template]

### P1 — Fix This Sprint (HIGH)
[L1, L2, L4, L15, L16, L17, L19, L20, L21 findings]

### P2 — Fix When Touching File (MEDIUM/LOW)
[L3, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9, L11, L12, L18, L22, L23 findings]

## Linting Recommendations
[pyproject.toml diff]
[Makefile target suggestion]

## Acceptable Patterns (no action required)
| File | Line | Pattern | Justification |
|------|------|---------|---------------|
```

Call `ExitPlanMode` to request user approval. Wait for approval before proceeding to Stage 2.

---

### Stage 2 — Execution (after plan approval)

Apply the remediation plan that was approved. Only fix what was listed in the approved plan.

#### Auto-fixable patterns — apply directly:
- **FT-L1:** f-string → rewrite as %-style message body (embed context in message, not kwargs)
- **FT-L2:** Import swap to canonical factory
- **FT-L4:** Add `exc_info=True` to `logger.warning(` / `logger.error(` in except blocks
- **FT-L5:** Simple `print("...")` → `logger.info("...")` using %-style for any embedded values
- **FT-L7:** `.critical(` → `.error(`
- **FT-L11:** String concatenation → %-style message body
- **FT-L14:** Wrap stdlib log call kwargs in `extra={}` (stdlib only)
- **FT-L16:** Add `"disable_existing_loggers": False` to dictConfig call
- **FT-L19:** Capture `bind()` return value — `logger.bind(...)` → `logger = logger.bind(...)`
- **FT-L22:** loguru kwargs → %-style message body
- **FT-L23:** `.warn(` → `.warning(`
- **FT-L24:** Application kwargs → %-style message body (keep `exc_info=True`)

**Do not auto-fix L10 (credential leak)** — always flag for human review only.

#### Manual review required — leave TODO comments:
- FT-L3, FT-L6, FT-L8, FT-L9, FT-L10, FT-L12, FT-L13, FT-L15, FT-L17, FT-L18, FT-L20, FT-L21

TODO comment format:
```python
# TODO(signal-over-noise): [L6] INFO inside loop — consider DEBUG + summary. See references/logging-patterns.md#L6
```

#### Apply linting config changes (if approved in the plan):
Update `pyproject.toml` with the recommended ruff rules.

#### After applying fixes:

Run pre-commit on every file that was changed:
```bash
uv run pre-commit run --files <file1> <file2> ...
```

If pre-commit is not available, skip this step (do not fail).

Leave all changes **uncommitted** — the user reviews before committing.

#### Finish

Report a brief summary: N files changed, N auto-fixes applied, N TODO comments added.

## Key Design Notes

1. **Plan mode is the fix gate.** The user approves the remediation plan before any files are
   touched. The plan shows exact file:line locations, current code, and proposed fixes.

2. **Two invocations, not one.** Surface and Tune are separate `--mode` values. This keeps each
   plan focused and reviewable. Run Surface first; its execution recommends Tune as the next step.

3. **Framework-agnostic:** Tune's Step 2.1 discovers the logging framework and canonical factory
   from the codebase itself. Nothing is hardcoded.

4. **kwargs are a universal anti-pattern in application code:** Always embed context in the
   message body via %-style. Framework context (Temporal workflow_id, run_id, activity_type,
   task_queue, attempt, etc.) is auto-injected by the logging adapter — never pass it manually.
   All other application kwargs land in an unindexed JSON blob in the observability platform,
   making them invisible to log stream scanning. The only accepted kwarg is `exc_info=True`.
   L24 detects kwargs in application log calls (non-stdlib, outside the adapter file itself).

   **L3 and L12 are still framework-dependent for classification:** `extra={}` is correct in
   stdlib and wrong in structlog/loguru (use %-style body instead). %-style is the universal
   preferred format; in vanilla loguru (without a custom adapter bridge) %-style args are
   silently dropped — flag as HIGH. In stdlib and projects with a custom %-bridge adapter,
   %-style is already correct.

5. **L13 and L14 are crash-level stdlib patterns:** `extra={}` key collisions with reserved
   LogRecord attributes raise `KeyError` that propagates to the caller. Treat as P0.

6. **L10 is security-critical:** Never auto-fix credential patterns. Always flag for human review.

7. **Phase ordering matters:** Run Surface before Tune. A silent-swallow in an except block (P1/P2)
   overlaps with a missing-exc_info finding (L4). Surface fixes the structural problem; Tune then
   verifies the logging quality of the fix. Avoid double-reporting the same line.

8. **Typed-error prescription is mandatory.** Every fix that re-raises must name an `AppError`
   leaf from `application_sdk.errors`. The skill never recommends raising a bare builtin or a
   legacy `AtlanError`. The leaf catalogue (§2), litmus tests (§3), SDK-context cookbook (§4),
   and exhaustive legacy-constant migration table (§5) all live in
   `references/typed-error-prescription.md`. P12 (untyped builtin raises) and P13 (legacy
   `AtlanError` raises) fold the BLDX-1261 audit into surface mode — every finding gets a
   `Prescribed:` entry naming the target leaf and suggested code string.
