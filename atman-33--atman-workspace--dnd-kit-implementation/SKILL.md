Use this skill when building React applications that require drag-and-drop functionality with both container reordering (useSortable) and item dropping (useDroppable) capabilities, such as Kanban boards, file management systems, or playlist editors. Use when this capability is needed.

# dnd-kit Implementation Guide

## Overview

This skill provides patterns for implementing drag-and-drop functionality using dnd-kit library that supports both sortable containers and droppable targets simultaneously.

## Core Concept

The key to combining `useSortable` and `useDroppable` is **conditional logic based on drag context**:

- When dragging items → containers act as drop-only targets
- When dragging containers → containers act as sortable elements

This is achieved by detecting what's currently being dragged and enabling only the appropriate functionality.

## Implementation Pattern

### Container Component Structure

```tsx
const SortableDroppableContainer = ({ container }) => {
  // useSortable for container reordering
  const {
    attributes,
    listeners,
    setNodeRef: setSortableRef,
    transform,
    transition,
    isDragging,
  } = useSortable({ id: container.id });

  // useDroppable for receiving items
  const { setNodeRef: setDroppableRef, isOver } = useDroppable({
    id: container.id,
  });

  // Active element from context
  const { active } = useDndContext();

  // Determine behavior based on what's being dragged
  const isItem = active?.id?.toString().startsWith('item-');
  const isContainer = active?.id?.toString().startsWith('container-');

  // Apply conditional refs
  const setNodeRef = isItem ? setDroppableRef : setSortableRef;

  return (
    <div ref={setNodeRef} {...(isContainer ? attributes : {})} style={style}>
      <div {...(isContainer ? listeners : {})}>{/* Drag handle */}</div>
      {/* Container content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Key Implementation Points

1. **Dual Hook Usage**: Use both `useSortable` and `useDroppable` in the same component
2. **Context Detection**: Use `useDndContext()` to check what's being dragged
3. **Conditional Refs**: Apply the appropriate ref based on drag state
4. **ID Naming Convention**: Use prefixes like `container-*` and `item-*` to distinguish types

### ID Naming Convention

```tsx
// Containers
const containerId = `container-${id}`;

// Items
const itemId = `item-${id}`;
```

This convention makes conditional logic clean and maintainable.

### State Management Critical Point

When updating container items, always create new objects:

```tsx
// ❌ Won't trigger re-render
containers.items.push(newItem);

// ✅ Correct - creates new reference
setContainers(prev => prev.map(c =>
  c.id === targetId
    ? { ...c, items: [...c.items, newItem] }
    : c
));
```

## Common Use Cases

- **Kanban Boards**: Reorder columns and move cards between columns
- **File Management**: Reorganize folders and move files into folders
- **Playlist Editors**: Reorder playlists and add songs to playlists
- **Task Managers**: Reorder task lists and move tasks between lists
