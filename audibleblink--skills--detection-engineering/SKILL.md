# Detection Engineering

Apply core detection engineering frameworks to write robust, evasion-resistant detection rules.

## Detection Rule Analysis Framework

When writing or reviewing a detection rule, answer these three questions:

### 1. Detection Goal
What activity is this rule trying to detect?
- Define the objective clearly (e.g., "detect malicious service creation")
- Understanding the goal is essential for evaluating efficacy

### 2. Identification
How does this rule establish the set of relevant events?
- Identify ALL events representing the target activity before classifying them
- Find the **base condition**: an event that must occur regardless of tool or method
- Example: Service creation base condition = registry key at `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\<ServiceName>`

**Warning**: A rule detecting service creation via `sc.exe create` missed 99.97% of actual service creation events in testing.

### 3. Classification
How does the rule differentiate "good" from "bad" events?
- Apply detection logic to the identified population
- Balance false positives vs false negatives based on organizational capacity

## Capability Abstraction

Attacker tools are abstractions of underlying attack capabilities. Peel back layers to find robust detection points:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tools        │ Mimikatz, Rubeus, PowerShell scripts        │ ← Easy to bypass
├──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Managed Code │ .NET classes (KerberosRequestorSecurityToken)│
├──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Windows API  │ InitializeSecurityContext, LsaCallAuth...   │
├──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ RPC          │ Interface UUIDs, DLL endpoints              │
├──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Network      │ Kerberos TGS-REQ/REP                        │ ← Hard to evade
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight**: Lower abstraction layers = broader coverage but more false positives. Higher layers = precise but easier to evade.

## Detection Spectrum

Detections fall on a spectrum between precise and broad:

| Type | False Positives | False Negatives | Use Case |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Precise** | Low | High | Known malicious tool hash, specific command patterns |
| **Broad** | High | Low | Fundamental behaviors (network protocols, API calls) |

**Effective strategy**: Layer multiple detections across different abstraction levels and spectrum positions.

## Building Robust Detections

1. **Identify spanning sets of observables**
   - Find events that cover many/all implementations
   - Use Detection Decomposition Diagrams (D3) to visualize coverage
   - Example: For Scheduled Tasks, both registry keys (TaskCache\Tasks) and EID 4698 are spanning observables

2. **Select observables most specific to malicious behavior**
   - Choose observables that are robust (hard to evade) AND effective at distinguishing malicious from benign
   - Example: EID 4698 covers most Scheduled Task implementations with good accuracy

3. **Add exclusions for false positive reduction**
   - Exclusions must be specific to avoid creating "hiding spaces"
   - Use robust fields (difficult for adversaries to modify)
   - Build environmental baselines for allow-listing
   - **Assume adversaries know your detection logic**

4. **Incorporate into fused analytic frameworks**
   - Combine multiple analytics: Risk-Based Alerting (RBA), Graph Analysis, Statistical Analysis

## Funnel of Fidelity

The five sequential phases of detection and response:

```
Collection (1000000s events) → Detection (100s alerts) → Triage → Investigation (10s leads) → Remediation (1s incidents)
```

**Don't clog the funnel**: Each stage must effectively filter for the next. Fix bottlenecks at the earliest stage first.

## Detection Categories by Timeframe

| Type | Description | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| **Point-in-Time (PIT)** | Scans for active technique use | Simple, no agent | Misses ephemeral data |
| **Historical (HDT)** | Analyzes logged data | Fills ephemeral gaps | Logs incomplete, tamperable |
| **Real-time/Agent** | Captures events as they happen | No blind spots | Agent can be disabled |

## Writing Detection Rules Checklist

Before finalizing a detection rule:

- [ ] **Goal**: Can you state the detection objective in one sentence?
- [ ] **Identification**: Does the rule capture ALL relevant events (not just one tool)?
- [ ] **Base condition**: Have you identified the unavoidable event for this technique?
- [ ] **Abstraction level**: What layer are you detecting at? Is it appropriate?
- [ ] **Spectrum position**: Is this precise or broad? Is that intentional?
- [ ] **Exclusions**: Are they specific and using robust fields?
- [ ] **Evasion resistance**: How easily can an attacker bypass this rule?
- [ ] **Coverage**: Combined with other rules, do you have layered coverage?
