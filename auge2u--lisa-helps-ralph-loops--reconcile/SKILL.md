# Reconcile Skill (Stage 5)

This skill compares what each project says about itself (via `.gt/memory/semantic.json`) against what the ecosystem assumes, producing an alignment report and checkpoint.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- A plugin ships a new version
- A new project is added to the ecosystem
- Quality gates or schemas change across plugins
- Steering questions are resolved and decisions recorded
- Prior reconcile is stale (check `.checkpoint.json` timestamp)

## Output Structure

```
project/
└── scopecraft/
    ├── ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md   # Human-readable findings
    ├── PERSPECTIVES.md        # Side-by-side project self-reports
    └── .checkpoint.json       # Machine-readable state for recovery
```

Output templates: [`templates/`](templates/) | Checkpoint schema: [`checkpoint-schema.json`](checkpoint-schema.json)

## Ecosystem Configuration

The reconcile skill reads project locations from `~/.lisa/ecosystem.json`.

### Schema: ecosystem-config-v2

```json
{
  "$schema": "ecosystem-config-v2",
  "name": "ecosystem-name",
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "project-name",
      "path": "~/github/org/repo",
      "remote": "https://github.com/org/repo",
      "role": "role-description",
      "active": true,
      "notes": "optional context"
    }
  ],
  "updated": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
```

**New in v2:** The `remote` field (optional) specifies the git remote URL. When present, reconcile can locate projects even if cloned to non-standard paths by matching `git remote get-url origin`. The `path` field remains the primary lookup; `remote` is a fallback for project identification and portability.

**Backward compatibility:** `ecosystem-config-v1` (without `remote` field) is still fully supported. Reconcile will not fail on v1 configs.

**Path handling:** All paths use `~/` for portability. Expand tildes to absolute paths before file access. Example: `~/github/auge2u/lisa3` becomes `/Users/<user>/github/auge2u/lisa3`.

### Standalone Mode

When `~/.lisa/ecosystem.json` is missing or contains only one project, reconcile runs in **standalone mode**:
- Reports on the single project only (current directory)
- Reads local `.gt/memory/semantic.json` and `scopecraft/` artifacts
- Produces a simplified ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md (no cross-project comparison)
- Checkpoint records single-project state for context recovery
- Prints informational message: "Running in standalone mode (1 project). Add projects to ~/.lisa/ecosystem.json for ecosystem reconciliation."

## Reconciliation Procedure

### Step 0: Check for Incremental Mode

If a prior checkpoint exists (`scopecraft/.checkpoint.json`):
1. Read each project's last known git commit hash from `checkpoint.projects.<name>.git_hash`
2. For each active project with a known path, check current `git rev-parse HEAD`
3. If the hash matches, the project is **unchanged** -- skip re-scanning its semantic.json (use cached state from checkpoint)
4. If the hash differs or is missing, mark as **changed** -- perform full scan
5. If `--force` flag is set (or user explicitly requests full re-scan), skip this optimization and scan everything

This makes reconcile faster for large ecosystems where most projects haven't changed.

### Step 1: Load Ecosystem Config

1. Read `~/.lisa/ecosystem.json`
2. Validate it has `projects` array with at least 1 entry
3. Expand all `~` paths to absolute paths
4. Note which projects are `active: true`
5. For each project with a `remote` field, if the `path` doesn't exist, try to locate the repo by scanning common clone directories for a matching `git remote get-url origin`

**If `~/.lisa/ecosystem.json` is missing:**
- If the current directory has `.gt/memory/semantic.json`, run in **standalone mode** (see above)
- Otherwise, stop and instruct user to create the config. Provide the schema above.

### Step 2: Gather Semantic Memory

For each active project:

1. Check if `<project.path>` exists locally
2. If local: read `<project.path>/.gt/memory/semantic.json`
3. If not local: try GitHub API as fallback (e.g. `gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/contents/.gt/memory/semantic.json`)
4. If neither works: record project as `status: "not-found"` and continue

**Handle different schemas gracefully:**
- Lisa and Carlos use `semantic-memory-v1` schema with `ecosystem_role`, `integration_points`, `non_goals`
- Conductor (and other gastown projects) may use `https://gastown.dev/schemas/semantic-memory.json` without ecosystem fields
- Extract common fields regardless of schema: `project.name`, `project.type`, `project.primary_language`, `tech_stack`
- Flag schema differences as a finding (not an error)

### Step 3: Read Existing Ecosystem State

If running from ecosystem root:
1. Read `scopecraft/ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md` if it exists (prior findings)
2. Read `scopecraft/.checkpoint.json` if it exists (prior state)
3. Note the prior reconcile version and timestamp for change tracking

### Step 4: Compare Perspectives

For each pair of projects, check:

| Check | What to compare |
|-------|----------------|
| **Role conflicts** | Do any two projects claim the same role or write to the same outputs? |
| **Interface agreements** | Does what project A says it writes match what project B says it reads? |
| **Tech stack drift** | Are shared dependencies on compatible versions? |
| **Constraint violations** | Does any project violate another's stated constraints or non-goals? |
| **Capability gaps** | Are expected capabilities (from design docs) missing from self-reports? |
| **Schema divergence** | Do projects use different semantic.json schemas? What fields are missing? |
| **Stale assumptions** | Are any assumptions from prior reconcile now outdated? |

Classify each finding as:
- **Alignment** — Both projects agree
- **Misalignment** — Projects contradict each other (assign severity: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **Gap** — Expected information is missing

### Step 5: Validate Gate Configs

For each project that has quality gates:
1. Check if `gates.yaml` exists (declarative) or gates are hardcoded
2. Compare gate definitions across plugins — look for:
   - Same gate name, different criteria
   - Missing gates that another plugin expects
   - Format inconsistencies (declarative vs hardcoded)
3. Record gate config misalignments

### Step 6: Generate Outputs

#### .checkpoint.json

Formal JSON Schema: [`checkpoint-schema.json`](checkpoint-schema.json)

```json
{
  "$schema": "reconcile-checkpoint-v1",
  "reconcile": {
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "version": "X.Y.Z",
    "previous_version": "X.Y.Z or null",

    "method": "lisa reconcile skill (Stage 5)"
  },
  "projects": {
    "<name>": {

      "source": "local filesystem|GitHub API",
      "semantic_json": {
        "exists": true,
        "version": "X.Y.Z",
        "schema": "schema-identifier",

    "misalignments": 0,
    "gaps": 0
  },
  "misalignments": [
    {
      "id": "M1",
      "severity": "high|medium|low",
      "description": "...",
      "affects": ["project-names"],

    }
  ],
  "resolved": [],
  "decisions": {
    "resolved_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "steering_questions": [],
    "open_questions": []
  },
  "next_reconcile_triggers": []
}
```

## Schema Tolerance

External projects (e.g., Conductor) may produce their own reconcile checkpoints with different field names. When reading external checkpoints during reconcile, extract common fields regardless of schema:
- `misalignments` / `remaining_misalignments` — treat as equivalent
- `steering_questions` / `steering_questions_resolved` + `open_queries` — extract both
- Different severity scales or status enums — normalize to Lisa's convention

The `reconcile-checkpoint-v1` schema (see [`checkpoint-schema.json`](checkpoint-schema.json)) is canonical for Lisa's own checkpoints. External formats are tolerated as input, not required to conform.

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| `~/.lisa/ecosystem.json` missing | If local `.gt/memory/semantic.json` exists, run in standalone mode. Otherwise, stop and print schema for user. |
| `~/.lisa/ecosystem.json` has only 1 project | Run in standalone mode with informational message. |
| Project path doesn't exist locally | Check `remote` field if present; try GitHub API; record as `"source": "GitHub API"` or `"not-found"` |
| `semantic.json` missing for a project | Record `semantic_json.exists: false`, continue with other projects. Do not crash. |
| `semantic.json` malformed | Record error in checkpoint, skip project's comparison. Do not crash. |
| Different schema than expected | Extract common fields, flag divergence as a finding (not an error) |
| No prior checkpoint | First reconcile -- skip "Changes Since" section and incremental check |
| Fewer than 2 projects reachable | Warn but still produce report (standalone comparison against own state) |
| Git not available | Skip git hash check, skip remote lookup, fall back to path-only |
| Ecosystem partner not installed | Informational message: "Carlos not found -- Lisa works standalone. Install Carlos for specialist analysis." Do not error. |

## Quality Gates

Reconcile quality gates are defined in `gates.yaml` (9 gates, automated via `validate.py --stage reconcile`):

| Gate | Check | Severity |
|------|-------|----------|
| `config_loaded` | Checkpoint confirms ecosystem config was loaded | blocker |
| `projects_found` | 2+ projects found in checkpoint | blocker |
| `alignment_report_exists` | ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md generated | blocker |
| `perspectives_exists` | PERSPECTIVES.md generated | blocker |
| `checkpoint_valid` | .checkpoint.json is valid JSON | blocker |
| `checkpoint_schema` | Checkpoint has reconcile-checkpoint-v1 schema | blocker |
| `report_has_summary` | Report has Summary section | blocker |
| `report_has_misalignments` | Report has Misalignments section | warning |
| `changes_tracked` | Prior version tracked in checkpoint | warning |

## Next Steps

After reconcile completes:
- Run `validate.py --stage reconcile` to verify outputs
- Review `ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md` for action items
- Address HIGH priority misalignments first
- Re-run reconcile after significant changes (see `next_reconcile_triggers` in checkpoint)
