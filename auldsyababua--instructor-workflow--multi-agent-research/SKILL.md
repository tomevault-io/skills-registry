# Multi-Agent Research

Production patterns from Anthropic's research system for conducting complex, multi-faceted research efficiently.

**Source**: [How we built our multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)

## When to Use

Use multi-agent-research patterns when:
- Research has 3+ independent dimensions to explore
- Comparing multiple alternatives simultaneously
- Need to synthesize information from 10+ sources
- Time-sensitive research requiring parallelization
- Complex technical landscape with unclear paths
- Breadth-first exploration needed

**Don't use for**:
- Simple fact-finding (1-2 sources)
- Single-dimension queries
- When sequential research is sufficient

## Core Principles

### 1. Scale Effort to Query Complexity

Assess complexity BEFORE starting research to allocate appropriate resources.

#### Simple Fact-Finding (3-10 tool calls)
- Single specific question with clear answer
- 1-2 authoritative sources needed
- Examples: Version number lookup, API syntax check, single DocType field validation

**Approach**: Direct search → validate → document

```typescript
// Example: Check ERPNext Task field
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({
  query: "ERPNext Task DocType fields"
})
// Review results → Document finding with citation
```

#### Direct Comparison (10-15 tool calls)
- Compare 2-3 specific alternatives
- Field mapping between systems
- Feature parity analysis

**Approach**: Parallel searches for each option → compare → recommend

```typescript
// Example: Compare DocTypes - execute in parallel
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "ERPNext Task DocType" })
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "ERPNext Project Task DocType" })
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "ERPNext ToDo DocType" })
// Compare results → Build comparison table → Recommend
```

#### Complex Multi-Faceted Research (20+ tool calls)
- Architecture decision with multiple unknowns
- Integration across multiple systems
- Novel feature requiring ecosystem research
- Multiple independent research dimensions

**Approach**: Use deep researcher OR spawn parallel focused sub-tasks

```typescript
// Example: Complex research with deep researcher
mcp__exasearch__deep_researcher_start({
  instructions: "Research OpenTelemetry integration for AWS Lambda Node.js. Cover: (1) Lambda layer vs manual instrumentation trade-offs, (2) X-Ray backend compatibility, (3) cold start performance impact, (4) 2025 best practices. Include code examples with versions.",
  model: "exa-research"
})
// Poll for completion, extract findings, add to research doc
```

**Complexity Heuristic**: If research question has 3+ independent dimensions, use parallel or deep researcher approach.

### 2. Parallel Tool Execution

Execute independent searches simultaneously for 90% faster results.

#### When to Parallelize

**Comparing alternatives**:
```typescript
// ❌ DON'T: Sequential searches (slow)
await mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "Redis session store" });
// wait...
await mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "Memcached session store" });
// wait...

// ✅ DO: Parallel searches (single message, multiple tool calls)
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "Redis session store" })
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "Memcached session store" })
mcp__exasearch__web_search_exa({ query: "Redis vs Memcached 2025 comparison" })
```

**Multi-source validation**:
```typescript
// Execute all simultaneously
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "OpenTelemetry Lambda official docs" })
mcp__exasearch__web_search_exa({ query: "OpenTelemetry Lambda examples 2025" })
mcp__exasearch__web_search_exa({ query: "OpenTelemetry Lambda deprecated OR EOL" })
```

**Independent research dimensions**:
```typescript
// All can run in parallel
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "Stripe API authentication" })
mcp__exasearch__web_search_exa({ query: "Stripe API rate limits" })
mcp__exasearch__web_search_exa({ query: "Stripe webhook best practices 2025" })
```

### 3. Search Strategy: Start Wide, Then Narrow

Progressive refinement prevents missing important context.

#### Anti-Pattern: Overly Specific Initial Queries

```
❌ DON'T START WITH:
"how to implement OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation for AWS Lambda with X-Ray backend using custom sampling rules in Node.js 18"

Result: Few/no results, miss alternative approaches
```

#### Recommended: Progressive Refinement

```
✅ STEP 1 - Broad Exploration (2-5 results):
"OpenTelemetry AWS Lambda Node.js"
→ Discover: What approaches exist? What's recommended?

✅ STEP 2 - Evaluate Landscape:
Review results, identify main approaches (layer vs manual instrumentation)

✅ STEP 3 - Narrow Focus (3-10 results):
"OpenTelemetry Lambda layer vs manual instrumentation"
→ Compare trade-offs

✅ STEP 4 - Specific Details:
"OpenTelemetry Lambda layer installation guide 2025"
→ Find working examples
```

#### Query Pattern Templates

| Purpose | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Discovery** | `[technology] [use case]` | "GraphQL federation microservices" |
| **Comparison** | `[option A] vs [option B] [criteria]` | "REST vs GraphQL performance" |
| **Implementation** | `[specific approach] [version] guide` | "GraphQL Apollo Federation v2 guide" |
| **Validation** | `[library] deprecated OR EOL OR migration` | "Apollo Federation deprecated" |

### 4. Thinking Process for Research

Use extended and interleaved thinking to plan strategy and evaluate results.

#### Planning Phase (Extended Thinking)

Before tool calls, think through:

```
[Extended thinking example]:

This ERPNext DocType selection question has 3 candidates to evaluate.
I need to research each in parallel:
- Field mappings (official docs)
- Custom field requirements (API specs)
- Community usage patterns (real-world examples)

I'll use ref.tools for official ERPNext docs (3 parallel calls) and
exa for community examples (3 parallel calls).

Total: 6 parallel tool calls for comprehensive coverage.
```

**Planning Checklist**:
1. What are the independent sub-questions?
2. Which tools fit this research?
3. What's the complexity level? (Simple/Comparison/Complex)
4. Which searches can run simultaneously?

#### After Tool Results (Interleaved Thinking)

After each set of results, evaluate:

```
[Interleaved thinking example]:

Results from 6 parallel searches received:

Quality check:
- Official docs: High confidence, current (v14)
- Community examples: Medium confidence, mix of v13/v14

Gap analysis:
- Tasks DocType: 80% field coverage, clear
- Project Tasks: 60% coverage, BUT community prefers for workflow integration
- Missing: Understanding WHY community prefers Project Tasks

Next step: Need one more targeted search on workflow capabilities difference
```

**Evaluation Checklist**:
- ✅ Are sources authoritative? Current? Relevant?
- ✅ What's still missing? What contradicts?
- ✅ Should I go deeper or pivot direction?
- ✅ What's my confidence level? (High/Medium/Low)

### 5. Deep Research Delegation

Know when to delegate to specialized deep research vs direct tool calls.

#### Decision Framework

| Use Direct Research | Use Deep Researcher |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Query scope clear and bounded | Open-ended exploration needed |
| 2-4 specific sources | Unclear which sources to check |
| Can complete in 10-15 tool calls | Requires 10+ sources |
| **Example**: "Compare Redis vs Memcached for sessions" | **Example**: "Research state of GraphQL federation in 2025 - solutions, trade-offs, migration paths" |

#### Deep Researcher Workflow

**1. Start task with detailed instructions**:

```typescript
mcp__exasearch__deep_researcher_start({
  instructions: `Research OpenTelemetry integration for AWS Lambda Node.js functions.

Focus areas:
1. Lambda layer vs manual instrumentation (trade-offs, pros/cons)
2. X-Ray backend compatibility (setup, configuration)
3. Cold start performance impact (benchmarks, mitigation)
4. Current best practices as of 2025 (official recommendations)

Deliverables:
- Code examples with specific version numbers
- Official documentation links
- Deprecation warnings if any
- Recommended approach with justification`,
  model: "exa-research" // or "exa-research-pro" for very complex
})
// Returns: { taskId: "abc123" }
```

**2. Poll for results** (repeat until status: "completed"):

```typescript
mcp__exasearch__deep_researcher_check({
  taskId: "abc123"
})
// Tool includes 5-second delay before checking
// Keep calling until status: "completed"
```

**3. Extract and integrate findings**:

```markdown
## Findings from Deep Research

**Source**: Deep Researcher Task abc123

### Finding 1: Lambda Layer Recommended
- **Summary**: Official docs recommend layer approach over manual
- **Evidence**: "Layer reduces cold start by 200ms, handles auto-instrumentation"
- **Source**: OpenTelemetry Lambda Docs (High confidence)
- **Code Example**: `layers: ['arn:aws:lambda:...:opentelemetry-nodejs']`

[Additional findings...]
```

### 6. Self-Improvement from Tool Failures

Adapt when tools don't work as expected.

#### Document Failure Patterns

When tool repeatedly fails:

```markdown
TOOL FAILURE PATTERN:
- Tool: mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation
- Query: "ERPNext v14 custom fields"
- Parameters: { query: "ERPNext v14 custom field creation API" }
- Expected: Documentation on custom field APIs
- Actual: No results returned (0 matches)
- Frequency: 5/5 attempts with different phrasings
```

#### Adaptation Strategies

1. **Try alternative tool**:
```typescript
// Primary tool failing, switch to web search
mcp__exasearch__web_search_exa({
  query: "ERPNext v14 custom field creation site:erpnext.com"
})
```

2. **Rephrase query**:
```typescript
// Original: "ERPNext v14 custom fields"
// Rephrased: "ERPNext custom field API" (drop version)
// Rephrased: "Frappe custom field creation" (use framework name)
```

3. **Break into smaller queries**:
```typescript
// Original: "ERPNext v14 custom field creation and validation API"
// Split into:
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "ERPNext custom field creation" })
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "ERPNext field validation" })
```

#### Report to Planning

```markdown
TOOL ISSUE REPORT:

**Tool**: mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation
**Issue**: Consistently returns no results for ERPNext v14 queries, v13 queries work
**Attempted**: 5 different query phrasings
**Workaround**: Using web_search_exa with site:erpnext.com filter, then validating
**Impact**: 30% slower research, but results accurate
**Recommendation**: Tool may need ERPNext v14 docs indexed
```

### 7. Findings Compression Strategy

Compress vast research into actionable context for downstream agents.

#### The Problem

Complex research generates 10+ sources with hundreds of pages. Action Agent needs compressed, decision-critical information only.

#### 4-Element Compression Pattern

For each major finding:

1. **Core claim** (1 sentence)
2. **Evidence** (quote or concrete example)
3. **Source** (URL + confidence level)
4. **Relevance** (why this matters for decision)

#### Anti-Pattern: Copying Entire Docs

```markdown
❌ DON'T:
Found 15-page OpenTelemetry Lambda guide covering:
- History of observability (3 pages)
- Architecture deep-dive (4 pages)
- Deployment options (2 pages)
- Configuration reference (5 pages)
- Troubleshooting (1 page)

[Paste entire guide]
```

#### Better: Extract Decision-Critical Information

```markdown
✅ DO:

**Finding**: OpenTelemetry Lambda layer recommended over manual instrumentation

- **Core Claim**: Layer approach reduces cold start by 200ms vs manual
- **Evidence**: Official guide states "Layer handles auto-instrumentation and reduces cold start overhead through optimized initialization"
- **Source**: [OpenTelemetry Lambda Docs - Deployment Options](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/faas/lambda-nodejs/#deployment) (High confidence - official docs)
- **Code Example**:
  ```typescript
  layers: ['arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:901920570463:layer:aws-otel-nodejs-ver-1-18-0:1']
  ```
- **Relevance**: Meets performance requirement (<500ms cold start) without custom instrumentation code, reduces maintenance burden

**Alternative Considered**: Manual instrumentation - rejected due to cold start penalty and maintenance overhead
```

#### Compression Checklist

Before handing off findings:

- [ ] Each finding fits in 3-5 sentences
- [ ] Code examples are minimal but working (not full files)
- [ ] Links to docs (don't paste full docs)
- [ ] Clear connection to decision criteria
- [ ] Confidence level explicit (High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Alternatives considered and rejection rationale

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### For Researcher Agent

Apply these patterns in existing research workflow:

1. **Query Complexity Assessment** → Add before "Search Existing Project Documentation"
2. **Parallel Tool Execution** → Use in "Conduct External Research" phase
3. **Search Strategy** → Apply when formulating search queries
4. **Thinking Process** → Use before tool calls and after results
5. **Deep Researcher** → Option in "Conduct External Research" for complex topics
6. **Tool Failures** → Add to Error Handling section
7. **Findings Compression** → Apply in "Document Findings with Citations"

### Output Format

Maintain existing output structure, enhance with compression:

```markdown
## Key Findings

### Finding 1: [Title]
**Core Claim**: [1 sentence]
**Evidence**: [Quote or concrete example]
**Source**: [URL + confidence]
**Relevance**: [Decision impact]

**Code Example** (if applicable):
```[language]
// Minimal working example
```

[Repeat for 3-5 key findings]
```

## Success Metrics

Applying multi-agent research patterns should result in:

- **Speed**: 90% faster for breadth-first queries (via parallelization)
- **Quality**: Higher confidence findings (progressive refinement)
- **Efficiency**: Right-sized effort (complexity assessment)
- **Completeness**: Better coverage (parallel exploration)
- **Usability**: Actionable findings (compression)

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Query

**Task**: Check if Redis supports session TTL

**Complexity**: Simple fact-finding
**Approach**: Direct search (3 tool calls)

```typescript
// Single targeted search
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({
  query: "Redis TTL expire session keys"
})
// Validate in official docs
// Document finding with citation
```

**Result**: 2 minutes, High confidence

### Example 2: Comparison Query

**Task**: Compare Redis vs Memcached for session storage

**Complexity**: Direct comparison
**Approach**: Parallel searches (10 tool calls)

```typescript
// Execute in parallel (single message)
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "Redis session storage features" })
mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation({ query: "Memcached session storage features" })
mcp__exasearch__web_search_exa({ query: "Redis vs Memcached session store 2025" })
mcp__exasearch__web_search_exa({ query: "Redis session TTL persistence" })
mcp__exasearch__web_search_exa({ query: "Memcached session limitations" })
```

**Result**: 8 minutes, comparison table with pros/cons, High confidence recommendation

### Example 3: Complex Multi-Faceted Query

**Task**: Research GraphQL federation migration from REST API

**Complexity**: Complex (architecture decision, multiple unknowns)
**Approach**: Deep researcher (40+ sources)

```typescript
mcp__exasearch__deep_researcher_start({
  instructions: `Research migrating from REST to GraphQL federation for microservices.

Focus areas:
1. Available federation solutions (Apollo, Mercurius, etc.) - compare features, maturity
2. Migration strategies (big bang vs incremental, REST wrapper patterns)
3. Schema stitching vs federation trade-offs
4. Performance implications (n+1 queries, caching)
5. Client migration (breaking changes, backward compatibility)
6. 2025 best practices and anti-patterns

Deliverables:
- Solution comparison table
- Recommended migration path with phases
- Code examples for federation setup
- Known gotchas and mitigation strategies`,
  model: "exa-research-pro"
})

// Poll until complete
mcp__exasearch__deep_researcher_check({ taskId: "..." })

// Extract findings, compress to key decisions
// Build recommendation with phased approach
```

**Result**: 45 minutes, comprehensive analysis with migration roadmap, Medium-High confidence (validated against official docs)

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Starting Too Specific

```
Query: "implement OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation AWS Lambda X-Ray custom sampling Node 18"
Result: 0 results or miss better approaches
```

**Fix**: Start broad, progressively narrow

### ❌ Sequential When Could Parallelize

```typescript
await search("Redis features");
await search("Memcached features");
await search("comparison");
```

**Fix**: Single message with 3 tool calls

### ❌ Pasting Entire Docs

```
Finding: [15 pages of OpenTelemetry docs copied]
```

**Fix**: Extract 4-element compressed findings

### ❌ Skipping Thinking Steps

```
[Immediately calls 10 tools without planning]
```

**Fix**: Extended thinking to plan, interleaved thinking to evaluate

### ❌ Using Deep Researcher for Simple Queries

```
Task: "What's the latest Redis version?"
Approach: deep_researcher_start (overkill)
```

**Fix**: Simple direct search (1-2 tool calls)
