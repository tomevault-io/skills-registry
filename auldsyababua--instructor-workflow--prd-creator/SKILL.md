# PRD Creator

## Overview

Create LLM-native Product Requirements Documents that serve as machine-interpretable, safety-focused specifications for AI agent development workflows. This skill implements a hybrid Markdown+YAML format optimized for token efficiency, human readability, and strict structural compliance.

**Key Principle**: The PRD is not documentation—it is a **control surface** that prevents AI agents from going rogue. Structured requirements protect non-technical users from context poisoning, hallucination, and constraint violations.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests:

- "Help me write a PRD for [feature]"
- "Create a requirements document for [product]"
- "Review this PRD for LLM compatibility"
- "Convert this doc to LLM-native format"
- "Validate my PRD for compliance"
- "Make this PRD safe for AI agents"

**Context indicators**: User mentions PRD, product requirements, specification, feature definition, or expresses concerns about AI agent behavior, hallucination, or code safety.

## Step 1: Creating a New PRD

### When to Use

User needs to create a PRD from scratch for a new feature or product.

### Process

1. **Understand the Feature**
   - Ask clarifying questions about the feature/product
   - Identify user personas and their goals
   - Determine technical constraints (languages, frameworks, security requirements)
   - Clarify what is explicitly OUT of scope

2. **Initialize the PRD**

Run the initialization script:
```bash
scripts/init_prd.py <output-path>
```

Example:
```bash
scripts/init_prd.py ./prds/user-authentication.md
```

The script will prompt for:
- Product/Feature name
- Owner name
- Version number (default: 1.0.0)

3. **Fill in Core Sections**

Load `assets/prd-template.md` for reference structure. Use the following order (forward-chaining principle):

**Section Order**:
1. YAML frontmatter (metadata)
2. Overview & Goals (the "why")
3. Technical Constraints (immutable rules)
4. User Personas (the actors)
5. Functional Requirements (the "what")
6. Non-Functional Requirements (quality attributes)
7. Out of Scope (boundaries)
8. Success Metrics (validation)

**Critical Safety Elements**:

In **YAML frontmatter**:
```yaml
llm_directives:
  temperature: 0.2  # Low temperature reduces hallucination
  persona: >
    You MUST NOT deviate from technical constraints or functional
    requirements without explicit approval.
```

In **Technical Constraints**:
```markdown
## 2. Technical Constraints & Environment

**CRITICAL**: These constraints are immutable.

* **Forbidden Libraries/Patterns**: pickle, eval(), exec()
```

In **Out of Scope**:
```markdown
## 6. Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

**CRITICAL**: Explicitly define what will NOT be built to prevent
scope creep and agent hallucination.

* [Feature X]
* [Feature Y]
```

4. **Assign Unique IDs**

Every requirement MUST have a machine-readable ID:

- User Stories: `LAW-31`, `LAW-32`, `LAW-33` (3-digit format)
- Acceptance Criteria: `AC-001-A`, `AC-001-B` (matches parent US)
- NFRs: `NFR-Perf-001`, `NFR-Sec-001` (category prefix)
- Personas: `Persona-Admin`, `Persona-User` (PascalCase)

Example:
```markdown
### **LAW-31**: User Registration

* **As a**: Persona-NewUser
* **I want to**: Create an account
* **So that**: I can access platform features

**Acceptance Criteria**:

* **AC-001-A**: System MUST validate email format
* **AC-001-B**: System MUST require password minimum 12 characters
* **AC-001-C**: System MUST hash passwords using bcrypt cost factor 12
```

5. **Write Atomic, Testable Criteria**

Each acceptance criterion = one test case.

**Bad** (too vague):
```markdown
* **AC-001-A**: The login should work and be secure
```

**Good** (testable, specific):
```markdown
* **AC-001-A**: System MUST authenticate user with valid email and password
* **AC-001-B**: System MUST return 401 Unauthorized for invalid credentials
* **AC-001-C**: System MUST use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
```

6. **Validate**

Run validation before considering the PRD complete:
```bash
scripts/validate_prd.py <path-to-prd.md>
```

Address all errors. Review warnings.

---

## Step 2: Converting an Existing PRD

### When to Use

User has an existing PRD (any format) that needs to be converted to LLM-native format.

### Process

1. **Analyze the Existing PRD**

Run the conversion assistant:
```bash
scripts/convert_prd.py <path-to-existing-prd.md>
```

The tool provides:
- Structure analysis (what sections exist)
- Pattern detection (user stories, acceptance criteria)
- ID format check
- Actionable recommendations

2. **Load Context for LLM Conversion**

Use an LLM agent to perform the conversion:

**Prompt Template**:
```
Load the following files into context:
1. [Path to existing PRD]
2. assets/prd-template.md
3. references/validation-rules.md

Task: Convert the existing PRD to LLM-native format following the
template structure. Ensure:
- YAML frontmatter with llm_directives
- Forward-chaining section order (constraints before requirements)
- Unique IDs for all user stories (US-XXX)
- Unique IDs for all acceptance criteria (AC-XXX-Y)
- Technical Constraints section with security requirements
- Out of Scope section with explicitly excluded features

Validate output against validation-rules.md before returning.
```

3. **Review LLM Output**

Manually review the converted PRD for:
- ✅ All original requirements preserved
- ✅ IDs assigned correctly
- ✅ Technical constraints captured
- ✅ Out of Scope section populated
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are atomic and testable

4. **Validate**

```bash
scripts/validate_prd.py <converted-prd.md>
```

Address all errors before use.

---

## Step 3: Validating an Existing PRD

### When to Use

User has a PRD and wants to verify it meets LLM-native compliance standards.

### Process

1. **Run Validation Script**

```bash
scripts/validate_prd.py <path-to-prd.md>
```

2. **Review Output**

The validator checks:

**Errors (MUST fix)**:
- ❌ Missing or invalid YAML frontmatter
- ❌ Missing required sections
- ❌ Sections out of order (violates forward-chaining)
- ❌ Duplicate user story IDs
- ❌ Duplicate acceptance criteria IDs
- ❌ Invalid ID formats

**Warnings (SHOULD review)**:
- ⚠️ User story ID not in 3-digit format (US-1 instead of LAW-31)
- ⚠️ AC ID doesn't match parent US (AC-042-A under LAW-31)
- ⚠️ Reference to non-existent ID
- ⚠️ Status not in recommended enum

3. **Fix Issues**

Address errors in order of priority:
1. YAML frontmatter issues (breaks machine parsing)
2. Missing required sections (incomplete specification)
3. Section ordering (affects LLM reasoning)
4. ID format and duplication (breaks traceability)

4. **Re-validate**

Run validation again until all errors are resolved:
```bash
scripts/validate_prd.py <path-to-prd.md> && echo "✅ PRD is compliant"
```

---

## Step 4: Reviewing and Iterating

### When to Use

After creating, converting, or validating a PRD, review for safety and completeness.

### Safety Review Checklist

Reference `references/safety-principles.md` for detailed guidance.

**YAML Frontmatter**:
- [ ] `status: approved` (only approved PRDs for autonomous agents)
- [ ] `llm_directives.temperature: 0.2` or lower (reduces hallucination)
- [ ] `llm_directives.persona` includes "MUST NOT deviate without approval"

**Technical Constraints** (Section 2):
- [ ] Section exists and appears BEFORE Functional Requirements
- [ ] Includes `**CRITICAL**` keyword
- [ ] Lists programming languages with versions
- [ ] Specifies frameworks and style guides
- [ ] Defines security requirements explicitly
- [ ] **Includes "Forbidden Libraries/Patterns"** (negative constraints)

**Functional Requirements** (Section 4):
- [ ] All user stories have unique US-XXX IDs (3 digits)
- [ ] All acceptance criteria have unique AC-XXX-Y IDs
- [ ] Each AC is atomic (one test case per criterion)
- [ ] Each AC uses MUST/SHOULD/MAY keywords (RFC 2119)

**Out of Scope** (Section 6):
- [ ] Section exists and is populated (not empty)
- [ ] Lists explicitly excluded features
- [ ] Includes `**CRITICAL**` keyword
- [ ] Mentions "prevent hallucination" in section header

**Validation**:
- [ ] `validate_prd.py` passes with zero errors
- [ ] All warnings reviewed and addressed if necessary

### Quality Checklist

**Granularity**:
- [ ] Each user story represents ONE capability
- [ ] Each acceptance criterion is testable by ONE test case
- [ ] No compound requirements ("X and Y" or "X or Y")

**Traceability**:
- [ ] All IDs are unique
- [ ] AC numbering matches parent US (AC-001-X under LAW-31)
- [ ] Cross-references point to valid IDs

**Completeness**:
- [ ] All personas referenced in user stories are defined in Section 3
- [ ] All technical constraints are specific (not "use secure hashing" but "use bcrypt cost factor 12")
- [ ] All NFRs include measurable thresholds ("< 250ms" not "fast")

---

## Advanced Usage

### Integration with Traycer Enforcement Framework

For users working with custom agentic coding frameworks (like traycer-enforcement-framework):

1. **Store PRD in Project Root**

```
/project-root/
  ├── PRD.md          # LLM-native PRD
  ├── src/
  └── tests/
```

2. **Configure Agent Context**

Ensure agents load the PRD at the beginning of each session:

```python
# Agent initialization
context = load_prd("./PRD.md")
agent.set_constraints(context.technical_constraints)
agent.set_personas(context.user_personas)
agent.set_requirements(context.functional_requirements)
```

3. **Enforce Validation Gates**

Add validation as a pre-commit hook:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

scripts/validate_prd.py PRD.md || {
  echo "❌ PRD validation failed. Fix errors before committing."
  exit 1
}
```

4. **Use for RAG Context**

When agents need implementation guidance:

```python
# Query: "How to implement US-042?"
# RAG retrieves:
#   - US-042 chunk
#   - All AC-042-X chunks
#   - Referenced Technical Constraints
#   - Related Persona definitions

# Agent receives complete, coherent context
```

### LLM Directives for Different Scenarios

Customize the `llm_directives` block based on use case:

**Strict Production Code**:
```yaml
llm_directives:
  model: "gpt-4-turbo"
  temperature: 0.1  # Very low for deterministic output
  persona: >
    You are a senior engineer generating production code. You MUST NOT
    deviate from technical constraints. All code MUST be tested. Reject
    any request to implement Out of Scope features.
```

**Exploratory Prototyping**:
```yaml
llm_directives:
  model: "gpt-4-turbo"
  temperature: 0.5  # Higher for creative solutions
  persona: >
    You are building a prototype. Follow technical constraints but
    propose alternative approaches when beneficial. Flag any Out of
    Scope features for discussion.
```

**Test Generation**:
```yaml
llm_directives:
  model: "gpt-4-turbo"
  temperature: 0.2
  persona: >
    You are a QA engineer generating comprehensive test cases. For each
    acceptance criterion (AC-XXX-Y), generate positive, negative, and
    edge case tests. Ensure 100% coverage of all ACs.
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: "AI as Junior PM"

**Scenario**: PM needs first draft of PRD quickly.

**Workflow**:
1. PM provides context (user research, business goals)
2. PM provides template: `assets/prd-template.md`
3. LLM generates 70-80% complete draft
4. PM refines and validates
5. Validate with `scripts/validate_prd.py`

### Pattern 2: Incremental Feature Addition

**Scenario**: Adding new user stories to existing PRD.

**Workflow**:
1. Identify next available US-XXX ID
2. Write user story following format
3. Add atomic acceptance criteria (AC-XXX-Y)
4. Update Appendix A cross-reference index
5. Validate to ensure no duplicate IDs

### Pattern 3: PRD Review Before Agent Use

**Scenario**: User finished draft, wants to ensure it's safe for agents.

**Workflow**:
1. Run `scripts/validate_prd.py <prd.md>`
2. Fix all errors
3. Load `references/safety-principles.md`
4. Review against Safety Review Checklist (Step 4)
5. Update `status: approved` in YAML frontmatter
6. Commit to version control

### Pattern 4: Converting Legacy Documentation

**Scenario**: User has old requirements doc (Word, Google Docs, etc.).

**Workflow**:
1. Export to plain text or markdown
2. Run `scripts/convert_prd.py <old-doc.md>`
3. Review recommendations
4. Use LLM agent with template to convert
5. Manual review for accuracy
6. Validate with `scripts/validate_prd.py`
7. Iterate until compliant

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Missing required metadata field: X"

**Cause**: YAML frontmatter missing required field.

**Fix**: Add to frontmatter:
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
owner: your-name
status: draft
last_updated: 2025-01-15
```

### Error: "Section order violation: 'Functional Requirements' should come after 'Technical Constraints'"

**Cause**: Sections out of forward-chaining order.

**Fix**: Reorder sections to match Step 1 section order. Technical Constraints MUST come before Functional Requirements.

### Warning: "AC-042-A appears under LAW-31 but ID suggests it belongs to US-042"

**Cause**: Acceptance criterion under wrong user story.

**Fix**: Move AC-042-X criteria under their matching US-042 parent, or renumber if intentional.

### Error: "Duplicate user story ID: LAW-35"

**Cause**: Same US-XXX ID used twice in document.

**Fix**: Find duplicate IDs and renumber one of them. Update all references.

### Agent Hallucinating Features

**Cause**: Out of Scope section missing or too vague.

**Fix**: Add explicit Out of Scope section with `**CRITICAL**` keyword. List exact features that should NOT be built.

### Agent Violating Technical Constraints

**Cause**: Constraints not explicit enough or placed after requirements.

**Fix**:
1. Move Technical Constraints to Section 2 (before requirements)
2. Add `**CRITICAL**` and `**MUST**` keywords
3. List forbidden patterns explicitly
4. Lower `temperature` in llm_directives to 0.1

---

## Best Practices

1. **Validate Early and Often**: Run `validate_prd.py` after every major edit
2. **Use Low Temperature**: Set `temperature: 0.2` or lower for production code generation
3. **Be Explicit**: "Use bcrypt cost factor 12" not "use secure hashing"
4. **Define Negatives**: Out of Scope section prevents hallucination
5. **Atomic Criteria**: One AC = one test case, always
6. **Version Control**: Commit PRD changes with descriptive messages
7. **Status Discipline**: Only set `status: approved` after thorough review
8. **ID Consistency**: Use 3-digit format (LAW-31) not variable digits (US-1)

---

## Quick Reference

**Create new PRD**:
```bash
scripts/init_prd.py ./prds/my-feature.md
# Edit the file
scripts/validate_prd.py ./prds/my-feature.md
```

**Convert existing PRD**:
```bash
scripts/convert_prd.py ./old-prd.md
# Review recommendations
# Use LLM to convert with template
scripts/validate_prd.py ./new-prd.md
```

**Validate PRD**:
```bash
scripts/validate_prd.py ./PRD.md
```

**Key ID Formats**:
- User Stories: `LAW-31`, `US-042`, `US-150`
- Acceptance Criteria: `AC-001-A`, `AC-042-B`
- NFRs: `NFR-Perf-001`, `NFR-Sec-002`
- Personas: `Persona-Admin`, `Persona-User`

**Safety Keywords**:
- `**CRITICAL**` in Technical Constraints and Out of Scope headers
- `MUST` / `SHOULD` / `MAY` in acceptance criteria (RFC 2119)
- `temperature: 0.2` or lower in llm_directives
