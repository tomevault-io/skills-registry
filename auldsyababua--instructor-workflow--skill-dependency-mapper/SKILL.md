# Skill Dependency Mapper

Analyzes the skill ecosystem to understand relationships, identify inefficiencies, and optimize workflows.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users ask about:
- Which skills commonly work together
- Skill combinations that create bottlenecks
- Optimal skill "stacks" for specific tasks
- Workflow optimization across skills
- Understanding skill dependencies
- Token budget concerns with multiple skills

## Core Workflow

### 1. Scan and Analyze Skills

Run the analyzer script to extract metadata from all available skills:

```bash
cd /home/claude/skill-dependency-mapper
python scripts/analyze_skills.py > /tmp/skill_analysis.txt
```

The script extracts:
- Tool dependencies (bash_tool, web_search, etc.)
- File format associations (docx, pdf, xlsx, etc.)
- Domain overlap (document, research, coding, etc.)
- Complexity metrics (size, tool count, bundled resources)

### 2. Detect Bottlenecks

For bottleneck analysis, first capture skill data as JSON:

```python
import json
from scripts.analyze_skills import SkillAnalyzer

analyzer = SkillAnalyzer()
analyzer.scan_skills()

# Save for bottleneck detection
with open('/tmp/skill_data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(analyzer.skills, f, default=list)
```

Then run bottleneck detection:

```bash
python scripts/detect_bottlenecks.py /tmp/skill_data.json > /tmp/bottlenecks.txt
```

### 3. Generate Dependency Map

Create a text-based dependency visualization:

```python
from scripts.analyze_skills import SkillAnalyzer

analyzer = SkillAnalyzer()
analyzer.scan_skills()

# Generate dependency mapping
dependencies = analyzer.find_dependencies()

# Format as markdown
output = ["# Skill Dependency Map\n"]
for skill, related in sorted(dependencies.items()):
    if related:
        output.append(f"## {skill}\n")
        output.append("Works well with:\n")
        for related_skill in sorted(related)[:8]:
            # Show why they're related
            skill_a = analyzer.skills[skill]
            skill_b = analyzer.skills[related_skill]
            
            shared = []
            if skill_a['tools'] & skill_b['tools']:
                shared.append(f"tools: {', '.join(skill_a['tools'] & skill_b['tools'])}")
            if skill_a['formats'] & skill_b['formats']:
                shared.append(f"formats: {', '.join(skill_a['formats'] & skill_b['formats'])}")
            if skill_a['domains'] & skill_b['domains']:
                shared.append(f"domains: {', '.join(skill_a['domains'] & skill_b['domains'])}")
            
            reason = " | ".join(shared) if shared else "complementary"
            output.append(f"- **{related_skill}** ({reason})\n")
        output.append("\n")

print('\n'.join(output))
```

### 4. Recommend Skill Stacks

For task-specific recommendations:

```python
from scripts.analyze_skills import SkillAnalyzer

analyzer = SkillAnalyzer()
analyzer.scan_skills()

# Get recommended stacks
stacks = analyzer.recommend_stacks()

# Format output
output = ["# Recommended Skill Stacks\n"]
for stack in stacks:
    output.append(f"## {stack['name']}\n")
    output.append(f"**Use case**: {stack['use_case']}\n\n")
    output.append("**Skills**:\n")
    for skill in sorted(stack['skills']):
        skill_data = analyzer.skills[skill]
        output.append(f"- **{skill}** - {skill_data['description'][:80]}...\n")
    output.append("\n")

print('\n'.join(output))
```

### 5. Custom Analysis

For specific queries, filter and analyze programmatically:

```python
from scripts.analyze_skills import SkillAnalyzer

analyzer = SkillAnalyzer()
analyzer.scan_skills()

# Example: Find all skills that use web_search
web_skills = [
    name for name, data in analyzer.skills.items()
    if 'web_search' in data['tools']
]

# Example: Find skills by domain
financial_skills = [
    name for name, data in analyzer.skills.items()
    if 'financial' in data['domains']
]

# Example: Find lightweight skills
lightweight = [
    name for name, data in analyzer.skills.items()
    if data['complexity_score'] < 5 and data['size'] < 2000
]
```

## Output Format

Generate concise markdown reports with:

1. **Executive summary** - Key findings in 2-3 sentences
2. **Dependency maps** - Skills grouped by relationship strength
3. **Bottleneck analysis** - Identified issues with impact assessment
4. **Recommendations** - Actionable optimization suggestions
5. **Skill stacks** - Pre-configured combinations for common workflows

Keep output token-efficient:
- Use bullet points for lists
- Bold key skill names
- Include only actionable insights
- Omit verbose explanations

## Interpreting Results

### Dependency Strength

- **Strong**: Share 3+ characteristics (tools, formats, domains)
- **Medium**: Share 2 characteristics
- **Weak**: Share 1 characteristic

### Bottleneck Severity

- **High**: >10k combined token size or >5 tool calls
- **Medium**: 5-10k tokens or 3-5 tool calls
- **Low**: <5k tokens or <3 tool calls

### Stack Optimization

Optimal stacks minimize:
- Total token budget (<15k characters)
- Tool call diversity (<4 different tools)
- Format conversion steps (<2 conversions)

## Advanced Usage

### Consulting Known Patterns

For established patterns and anti-patterns, reference:

```bash
view /home/claude/skill-dependency-mapper/references/known_patterns.md
```

Use this when:
- User asks about best practices
- Workflow seems suboptimal
- Need to explain why certain combinations work well

### Custom Bottleneck Detection

Modify detection thresholds in `detect_bottlenecks.py`:

```python
detector.detect_high_tool_usage(threshold=4)  # Adjust tool count threshold
detector.detect_large_references(size_threshold=8000)  # Adjust size threshold
detector.detect_token_budget_risks(combined_threshold=12000)  # Adjust combined size
```

### Filtering by Skill Type

Analyze only specific skill types:

```python
analyzer = SkillAnalyzer()
analyzer.scan_skills()

# User skills only
user_skills = {
    name: data for name, data in analyzer.skills.items()
    if data['type'] == 'user'
}

# Public skills only
public_skills = {
    name: data for name, data in analyzer.skills.items()
    if data['type'] == 'public'
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### "Which skills work together for data analysis?"

1. Run analyzer to find spreadsheet/data skills
2. Filter by shared domains and tools
3. Generate dependency map for data domain
4. Recommend optimized stack

### "What's causing slowdowns in my document workflow?"

1. Run bottleneck detection
2. Focus on document-related skills
3. Identify high tool usage or token budget issues
4. Suggest sequential processing or skill consolidation

### "Recommend skills for financial reporting"

1. Filter skills by 'financial' domain
2. Find complementary skills (spreadsheet, presentation)
3. Assess token budget feasibility
4. Output recommended stack with rationale

### "Show me skill dependencies visually"

1. Generate full dependency map
2. Group by relationship strength
3. Highlight clusters of related skills
4. Format as hierarchical markdown sections

## Limitations

- Dependency detection is heuristic-based (not ground truth)
- Cannot analyze skills not in /mnt/skills
- Token estimates are approximate (actual may vary)
- Bottleneck severity depends on specific usage patterns
- No access to actual conversation usage data

## Tips for Effective Analysis

1. **Be specific**: Filter by domain/format for targeted results
2. **Consider context**: Bottlenecks depend on user's workflow
3. **Iterate**: Run analysis, optimize, re-analyze
4. **Validate**: Test recommended stacks with real tasks
5. **Stay current**: Re-run after skill updates or additions
