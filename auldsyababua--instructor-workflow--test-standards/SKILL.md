description: Test quality validation detecting mesa-optimization, happy-path bias, vacuous assertions, and error-swallowing anti-patterns. Use when reviewing test files for quality issues, evaluating test meaningfulness, or ensuring tests validate behavior rather than passing trivially. Supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python test frameworks. Use when this capability is needed.

# Test Standards

Validates test quality through automated scanning and LLM-guided heuristics to detect:
- Mesa-optimization (tests that pass trivially)
- No assertions (tests execute but verify nothing)
- Tautological assertions (always true regardless of implementation)
- Vacuous property checks (only existence, not values)
- Mock-only validation (only verify mocks called, not behavior)
- Happy-path bias (only success tests, no error handling)
- Error-swallowing patterns (catch blocks without assertions)
- Missing async test protection (`expect.assertions(n)`)
- Low assertion density (superficial testing)

## When to Use

Execute test-standards during QA validation:
1. After reviewing test file changes
2. When tests were modified by Action Agent
3. Before approving changes for merge
4. When evaluating test meaningfulness
5. During test creation/maintenance

## Validation Workflow

### 1. Automated Scanning (Script)

Run script first for deterministic, fast detection:

**Scan specific test files:**
```bash
python scripts/test_quality_scanner.py tests/auth.test.ts tests/api.test.ts --format json
```

**Scan test directory:**
```bash
python scripts/test_quality_scanner.py ./tests --format json
```

**Save report:**
```bash
python scripts/test_quality_scanner.py ./tests --output test-quality-report.json
```

**Exclude patterns:**
```bash
python scripts/test_quality_scanner.py ./tests --exclude node_modules .snapshots --format json
```

### 2. Interpret Scan Results

Parse JSON output and evaluate findings:

**Finding Structure:**
```json
{
  "category": "no_assertions|tautological_assertion|vacuous_check|mock_only_validation|...",
  "severity": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
  "file": "tests/auth.test.ts",
  "test_name": "validates user login",
  "line": 42,
  "pattern": "regex pattern or description",
  "context": "relevant code snippet",
  "message": "human-readable description"
}
```

**Report Structure:**
```json
{
  "files_scanned": 15,
  "total_tests": 128,
  "total_findings": 12,
  "findings_by_severity": {
    "CRITICAL": 2,
    "HIGH": 5,
    "MEDIUM": 4,
    "LOW": 1
  },
  "findings": [...],
  "test_stats": [
    {
      "file": "tests/auth.test.ts",
      "total_tests": 25,
      "tests_with_assertions": 23,
      "tests_without_assertions": 2,
      "async_tests_without_protection": 3,
      "error_tests": 5,
      "success_tests": 18,
      "avg_assertions_per_test": 3.2
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "no_assertions": 2,
    "tautological_assertions": 1,
    "vacuous_checks": 3,
    "mock_only_validation": 2,
    "missing_assertion_count": 3,
    "error_swallowing": 1,
    "low_assertion_density": 0,
    "happy_path_bias": 1
  }
}
```

**Severity Guidelines:**
- **CRITICAL**: No assertions, tautological assertions - BLOCK merge immediately
- **HIGH**: Vacuous checks, mock-only validation, error swallowing - Require fixes
- **MEDIUM**: Happy-path bias, missing assertion count, low density - Review and justify
- **LOW**: Minor quality issues - Optional fixes

### 3. LLM Heuristic Review (Context-Dependent)

After automated scanning, apply judgment for patterns the script cannot detect:

#### Test Assertion Weakening

Compare test changes in git diff to detect semantic weakening:

**Indicators of Weakening:**
- Reduced assertion count without clear reason
- Replaced specific assertions with generic checks
- Removed edge case validations
- Changed from behavior validation to mock validation only

**Example - Weakened Test:**
```typescript
// Before (git diff -)
expect(response.data).toMatchObject({
  id: expect.any(String),
  status: 'active',
  count: expect.any(Number)
});

// After (git diff +)
expect(response.data).toBeDefined(); // ❌ Lost specificity
```

**Action**: Flag as HIGH severity, request Action Agent restore specific assertions.

#### Scope Alignment

Verify test changes align with issue scope:

**Legitimate Changes:**
- Tests added for new feature functionality
- Tests updated to match changed implementation
- Error handling tests added for new edge cases

**Suspicious Changes:**
- Unrelated tests modified without explanation
- Tests removed without justification
- Test patterns changed across multiple files beyond issue scope

**Action**: Request clarification or justification in scratch notes.

#### Test Coverage Gaps

Identify functions/features lacking tests:

**Review Approach:**
1. Read implementation changes from git diff
2. Identify new functions, branches, error paths
3. Check if corresponding tests exist
4. Flag missing coverage for critical paths

**Action**: Request additional tests for uncovered critical functionality.

### 4. Generate Validation Report

Combine automated findings with heuristic review:

```markdown
## Test Standards Validation for [ISSUE-ID]

### Automated Scan Summary
- Test Files Scanned: X
- Total Tests: Y
- Total Findings: Z
- CRITICAL: A findings
- HIGH: B findings
- MEDIUM: C findings

### Critical Findings (BLOCK)
1. [test_name in file:line] - No assertions found
2. [test_name in file:line] - Tautological assertion: expect(true).toBe(true)

### High Priority Findings (FIX REQUIRED)
1. [test_name in file:line] - Only validates mocks, not behavior
2. [test_name in file:line] - Catch block swallows errors without assertions

### Medium Priority Findings (REVIEW)
1. [file:0] - Happy-path bias: 15 success tests, 0 error tests
2. [test_name in file:line] - Async try/catch missing expect.assertions(n)

### Heuristic Review
- **Assertion Quality**: PASS/WARN/FAIL with examples
- **Coverage Completeness**: PASS/WARN/FAIL with gaps identified
- **Scope Alignment**: PASS/WARN with details

### Test Statistics
- Average assertions per test: 3.2
- Tests without assertions: 2 (8%)
- Async tests without protection: 3 (12%)
- Error test coverage: 20%

### Recommendation
[APPROVED | CHANGES REQUIRED | BLOCKED]

### Action Items
[Specific fixes needed with file:line references]
```

## Finding Categories Reference

### no_assertions (CRITICAL)
Test executes code but makes no assertions. Always indicates a problem.

### tautological_assertion (CRITICAL)
Assertion always true regardless of implementation (e.g., `expect(true).toBe(true)`).

### vacuous_check (HIGH)
Only checks property exists without validating value (e.g., only `.toBeDefined()`).

### mock_only_validation (HIGH)
Test only verifies mocks were called, doesn't validate actual behavior.

### missing_assertion_count (MEDIUM)
Async test with try/catch missing `expect.assertions(n)` protection.

### error_swallowing (HIGH)
Catch block swallows errors without assertions (test always passes).

### low_assertion_density (LOW)
Test has suspiciously few assertions for its length (may be superficial).

### happy_path_bias (MEDIUM)
File has only success-path tests, no error handling tests.

## Integration with QA Protocol

Execute test-standards at **Step 3: Change Review (Diff)** or **Step 7: Tests (Right-Sized)** in QA workflow:

1. Action Agent completes implementation with test changes
2. **Run test-standards script on changed test files**
3. **Interpret automated findings**
4. **Apply LLM heuristics for semantic review**
5. Generate validation report
6. If CRITICAL or multiple HIGH findings:
   - BLOCK validation
   - Report to Traycer with specific file:line references
   - Delegate to Action Agent for fixes
   - Re-run validation after fixes
7. Continue with remaining QA steps

## Notes

- Run script first for deterministic checks (fast, reliable)
- Use LLM heuristics for semantic/contextual evaluation
- Always provide file:line references in reports
- CRITICAL findings must block merge
- Document justified exceptions in test comments
