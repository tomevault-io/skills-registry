# Fabric Patterns

Apply specialized prompt patterns from the Fabric framework for consistent, high-quality AI outputs.

## When This Skill Activates

- Summarizing documents, videos, meetings, papers, git diffs
- Analyzing code, threats, claims, logs, prose
- Extracting insights, ideas, entities, wisdom
- Creating PRDs, user stories, commit messages, documentation
- Improving writing, code, or prompts

| `create_git_diff_commit` | Commit messages |
| `create_design_document` | System design docs |

### Improve
| Pattern | Use |
|---------|-----|
| `improve_writing` | Grammar and clarity |
| `improve_prompt` | Enhance AI prompts |

## Full Pattern List

See all 232 patterns: `ls data/patterns/`

Read pattern details: `cat data/patterns/{name}/system.md`

## Example

User: "Summarize this research paper"

1. Read `data/patterns/summarize_paper/system.md`
2. Apply its methodology to the paper
3. Output per the pattern's format instructions
