# Run Tests

This skill provides a consistent way to run tests for the Nomos Terraform Remote State Provider project, including coverage analysis and reporting.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Run the test suite for the project
- Verify code coverage
- Check test results after making code changes
- Generate coverage reports
- Validate that changes don't break existing tests
- Run specific test files or packages

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.25.5 or later installed
- Project dependencies installed (`go mod download`)
- Write access to the project directory (for coverage files)

## Testing Commands

### 1. Run All Tests

To run all tests with race detection and coverage:

```bash
make test
```

This command:
- Runs all tests in the project
- Enables race detection (`-race`)
- Generates coverage profile (`coverage.out`)
- Uses atomic coverage mode for accurate results
- Displays total coverage percentage

**Expected output:**
```
Running tests...
go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic ./...
?   	github.com/autonomous-bits/nomos-provider-terraform-remote-state/cmd/provider	[no test files]
=== RUN   TestConfig
--- PASS: TestConfig (0.00s)
...
Coverage: 85.2%
```

### 2. Generate HTML Coverage Report

To create a visual coverage report:

```bash
make test-coverage
```

This command:
- Runs all tests with coverage
- Generates an HTML report (`coverage.html`)
- Opens automatically in your browser (on most systems)

**Output location:** `coverage.html` in the project root

### 3. Run Tests for Specific Package

To test a specific package:

```bash
go test -v ./internal/config
```

Or with coverage:

```bash
go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./internal/config
```

### 4. Run Specific Test Function

To run a specific test by name:

```bash
go test -v -run TestConfigValidation ./internal/config
```

### 5. Run Tests in Verbose Mode

To see detailed test output:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

## Verification Workflow

When verifying code changes, follow this complete workflow:

### Step 1: Format Code
```bash
make fmt
```

### Step 2: Run Static Analysis
```bash
make vet
```

### Step 3: Run Linters (Optional)
```bash
make lint
```

Note: Requires `golangci-lint` to be installed. See [installation guide](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/).

### Step 4: Run Tests
```bash
make test
```

### Step 5: Full Verification
Run all verification steps in one command:

```bash
make verify
```

This runs: format → vet → lint → test

## Understanding Test Output

### Test Result Indicators
- `PASS` - Test passed successfully
- `FAIL` - Test failed
- `SKIP` - Test was skipped
- `[no test files]` - Package has no test files (normal for main packages)

### Coverage Metrics
Coverage is reported as a percentage:
- **0-50%**: Low coverage, needs improvement
- **50-70%**: Moderate coverage
- **70-85%**: Good coverage
- **85%+**: Excellent coverage

### Race Detection
If a race condition is detected:
```
WARNING: DATA RACE
Read at 0x... by goroutine ...:
  ...
```
**Action:** Fix the race condition before committing code.

## Test File Locations

Tests are located alongside the code they test:
```
internal/
├── config/
│   ├── config.go
│   └── config_test.go
├── provider/
│   ├── provider.go
│   └── provider_test.go
└── state/
    ├── parser.go
    ├── parser_test.go
    └── types.go
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run tests frequently**: Test after every significant change
2. **Check coverage**: Aim for 80%+ coverage on new code
3. **Fix failing tests immediately**: Don't commit broken tests
4. **Use race detection**: Always run with `-race` flag
5. **Review coverage reports**: Use HTML reports to find untested code paths
6. **Test edge cases**: Include tests for error conditions and boundary cases
7. **Keep tests fast**: Slow tests discourage frequent testing
8. **Clean up coverage files**: Remove `coverage.out` and `coverage.html` before committing (they're in `.gitignore`)

## Troubleshooting

### Test Failures
**Symptom:** Tests fail with specific error messages

**Solution:**
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check the specific test function that failed
3. Run the failing test in isolation: `go test -v -run TestName ./path/to/package`
4. Add `-count=1` to disable test caching: `go test -count=1 -v ./...`

### Build Failures
**Symptom:** Tests fail to compile

**Solution:**
1. Run `go mod tidy` to fix dependency issues
2. Run `make deps` to download dependencies
3. Check for syntax errors in test files

### Coverage File Issues
**Symptom:** Cannot write coverage file

**Solution:**
1. Check write permissions in project directory
2. Clean existing coverage files: `make clean`
3. Ensure no other process is using the coverage file

### Golangci-lint Not Found
**Symptom:** `make lint` fails with "golangci-lint not found"

**Solution:**
Install golangci-lint:
```bash
# macOS
brew install golangci-lint

# Linux
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin

# Or use go install
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Test Check
```bash
# Run tests quickly without coverage
go test ./...
```

### Example 2: Full Test Suite with Coverage
```bash
# Run complete test suite
make test

# View coverage percentage
# Output: Coverage: 85.2%
```

### Example 3: Investigate Low Coverage
```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
make test-coverage

# Open coverage.html in browser
# Identify untested code paths (shown in red)
```

### Example 4: Debug Failing Test
```bash
# Run specific test with verbose output
go test -v -run TestBackendInit ./internal/backend

# Run with additional debug information
go test -v -race -count=1 -run TestBackendInit ./internal/backend
```

### Example 5: Pre-commit Verification
```bash
# Run full verification suite
make verify

# Or manually:
make fmt
make vet
make test
```

## Integration with CI/CD

This skill aligns with CI/CD workflows. The same commands work in:
- Local development
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- Jenkins
- Any CI system with Go installed

## Coverage Goals

Maintain these coverage targets:
- **Overall project**: 80%+
- **Core packages** (`internal/provider`, `internal/backend`): 90%+
- **Utility packages** (`internal/config`, `internal/state`): 85%+
- **New features**: 90%+ for new code

## Related Skills

- **update-changelog**: Update the CHANGELOG.md after successful tests
- **run-provider**: Run the provider after tests pass
