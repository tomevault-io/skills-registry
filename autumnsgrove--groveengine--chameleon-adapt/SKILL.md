# Chameleon Adapt

The chameleon doesn't force its environment to change. It reads the light, understanding where it lives. It sketches its form, creating structure. It shifts its hues, matching the forest around it. It adds texture—rough bark, smooth leaves, shifting light. Finally, it adapts completely, becoming one with its surroundings. The result feels organic, like it was always meant to be there.

## When to Activate

- User asks to "design this page" or "make it look Grove"
- User says "add some visual polish" or "theme this"
- User calls `/chameleon-adapt` or mentions chameleon/adapting
- Creating or enhancing pages for Grove sites
- Implementing seasonal decorations or weather effects
- Building glassmorphism containers for readability
- Adding nature components (trees, birds, particles)
- Working with the color palette system

### Phase 1: READ

_The chameleon reads the light, understanding where it lives..._

Before choosing a single color, understand the environment. Assess three things:

**What season is it?**

```svelte
import { season } from '$lib/stores/season';

const isSpring = $derived($season === 'spring');
const isAutumn = $derived($season === 'autumn');
const isWinter = $derived($season === 'winter');
// Summer is the default (no flag needed)
```

**What's the emotional tone?**

| Tone                | Season   | Mood                        |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Hope, renewal       | Spring   | Cherry blossoms, new growth |
| Growth, warmth      | Summer   | Full foliage, activity      |
| Harvest, reflection | Autumn   | Falling leaves, warm colors |
| Rest, stillness     | Winter   | Snow, frost, evergreens     |
| Dreams, far-future  | Midnight | Purple glow, fireflies      |

**Season Mood Summary:**

| Season     | Primary Colors                                       | Mood                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Spring** | `springFoliage`, `cherryBlossomsPeak`, `wildflowers` | Renewal, hope       |
| **Summer** | `greens`, `cherryBlossoms`                           | Growth, warmth      |
| **Autumn** | `autumn`, `autumnReds`                               | Harvest, reflection |
| **Winter** | `winter` (frost, snow, frosted pines)                | Rest, stillness     |

**What's the page's purpose?**

- Story/narrative pages — Full seasonal atmosphere
- Data-dense interfaces — Minimal decoration, focus on readability
- Landing/hero sections — Weather effects, randomized forests
- Forms/admin — Clean glass surfaces, no distractions

**Output:** Season selection and decoration level decision (minimal / moderate / full)

---

### Phase 2: SKETCH

_The chameleon outlines its form, creating structure..._

Build the page skeleton with glassmorphism layers. Establish the layering formula, place glass containers, and wire up the sticky navigation pattern.

Key decisions: Which glass variant fits each container? Where does content live in the z-index stack? What's the responsive breakdown?

**Reference:** Load `references/layout-patterns.md` for the layering formula, sticky nav pattern, page section templates, responsive grid patterns, spacing system, and accessibility layout rules.

**Quick glass starter:**

```svelte
import { Glass, GlassCard, GlassButton } from '@lattice/ui/ui';

<Glass variant="tint" class="p-6 rounded-xl">
	<p>Readable text over busy backgrounds</p>
</Glass>
```

**Reference:** Load `references/glass-components.md` for all glass variants, props, CSS utility classes, and composition patterns.

**Output:** Page structure with glass containers and z-index layers in place

---

### Phase 3: COLOR

_The chameleon shifts its hues, matching the forest around it..._

Apply the seasonal color palette from `@autumnsgrove/lattice/ui/nature`. Match palette choice to the emotional tone identified in READ. Use seasonal helper functions (`getSeasonalGreens`, `getCherryColors`) for consistent depth across the scene.

**Accent colors:** For any accent-colored surfaces (buttons, links, highlights, focus rings), use `var(--grove-accent-*)` tokens — NOT hardcoded green hex values. The user's accent color may not be green. Use `var(--grove-accent)` for solid, `var(--grove-accent-dark)` for hover, and `var(--grove-accent-N)` for opacity tints. The pre-commit hook enforces this. Brand greens (nature SVGs, logo) are fine with `// accent-ok`.

Also apply Grove terminology through GroveTerm components — never hardcode Grove-specific words in user-facing text.

**Reference:** Load `references/color-palette.md` for all color tokens with hex values, seasonal palettes (Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter/Midnight), accent palettes, helper functions, and background gradient patterns.

**Reference:** Load `references/groveterm-system.md` for the GroveTerm component suite, the `[[term|standard]]` syntax, common term vocabulary, and accessibility rules.

**Output:** Color scheme applied with proper imports and seasonal variants; user-facing text uses GroveTerm components

---

### Phase 4: TEXTURE

_The chameleon adds depth—rough bark, smooth leaves, shifting light..._

Layer nature components for atmosphere. Generate the randomized forest (trees never overlap — 8% minimum gap). Add weather effects appropriate to the season. Place seasonal birds for life. Wire up Lucide icons (never emojis). Respect the responsive density table.

**Reference:** Load `references/nature-components.md` for the full component catalog, randomized forest generation algorithm, weather effect snippets, seasonal bird placement, icon registry pattern, and mobile particle count adjustments.

**Output:** Nature components layered with proper z-index and responsive density

---

### Phase 5: ADAPT

_The chameleon becomes one with its surroundings—complete adaptation..._

Final polish and accessibility. Reduce particle counts for mobile. Add the mobile overflow sheet menu for navigation. Verify `prefers-reduced-motion` wraps all particle layers. Confirm all touch targets are 44x44px minimum. Check dark mode glass variants. Run CI.

**Verification (mandatory):**

```bash
pnpm install
gw ci --affected --fail-fast --diagnose
```

If CI fails: read diagnostics, fix, re-run. The chameleon does not leave broken code behind its color shift.

**Component Audit Gate (mandatory when building/modifying components):**

Before page-level verification, the chameleon audits every component it built or modified in isolation using Showroom. This catches design token violations, off-grid spacing, missing focus styles, and hardcoded colors that full-page captures miss.

```bash
# For each component built or modified, run a Showroom audit
uv run --project tools/glimpse glimpse showroom \
  libs/engine/src/lib/ui/components/[path-to-component].svelte

# Scaffold a fixture for new components (generates .showroom.ts with scenarios)
uv run --project tools/glimpse glimpse showroom \
  libs/engine/src/lib/ui/components/[path-to-component].svelte --scaffold
```

**This is a required gate.** Every component the chameleon touches must pass Showroom before moving to page-level Glimpse. Fix all compliance violations before proceeding.

**Visual Verification (mandatory for UI work):**

The chameleon doesn't just build — it _looks_ at what it built. Use Glimpse to capture the result and iterate until the design matches the vision:

```bash
# Prerequisite: seed the database if not already done
uv run --project tools/glimpse glimpse seed --yes

# Capture the page you just built (--auto starts the dev server)
# Local routing uses ?subdomain= for tenant isolation
uv run --project tools/glimpse glimpse capture \
  "http://localhost:5173/[your-page]?subdomain=midnight-bloom" \
  --season autumn --theme dark --logs --auto

# Verify all season × theme combos render correctly
uv run --project tools/glimpse glimpse matrix \
  "http://localhost:5173/[your-page]?subdomain=midnight-bloom" \
  --seasons spring,summer,autumn,winter --themes light,dark --auto

# Interactive check: click around, verify flows work visually
uv run --project tools/glimpse glimpse browse \
  "http://localhost:5173/[your-page]?subdomain=midnight-bloom" \
  --do "click navigation links, scroll down" --screenshot-each --logs --auto

# Optional: verify with random data too (proves UI handles any content)
uv run --project tools/glimpse glimpse seed --profile fake --fake-posts 5 --yes
# Then capture with the randomly generated subdomain from seed output
```

**The iterate loop:** Capture → review screenshot → spot issues → fix → capture again. Repeat until the adaptation is complete. Don't ship UI you haven't seen.

**Final Checklist (after CI passes AND visual verification):**

- [ ] CI: `gw ci --affected` passes clean
- [ ] Glimpse: Captured page looks correct in all target seasons
- [ ] Glimpse: Dark mode and light mode both verified visually
- [ ] Glimpse: No console errors in `--logs` output
- [ ] Glass effects used for text readability over busy backgrounds?
- [ ] Lucide icons, no emojis?
- [ ] Mobile overflow menu for navigation items?
- [ ] Decorative elements respect `prefers-reduced-motion`?
- [ ] Touch targets at least 44x44px?
- [ ] Seasonal colors match the page's emotional tone?
- [ ] Trees randomized with proper spacing (8% minimum gap)?
- [ ] Dark mode supported with appropriate glass variants?
- [ ] User-facing text follows Grove voice?
- [ ] Grove terminology uses GroveTerm components (not hardcoded)?
- [ ] `[[term]]` syntax used in data-driven content strings?

**Output:** Fully adapted, accessible, responsive UI ready for production — visually verified

## Chameleon Rules

### Intention

Every color choice serves the content. Decoration enhances readability—it never obstructs it.

### Restraint

Not every page needs a forest. Data-dense interfaces deserve clean glass surfaces without distraction.

### Authenticity

Use the seasonal system as intended. Spring isn't just "light colors"—it's renewal and hope.

### Communication

Use adaptation metaphors:

- "Reading the light..." (understanding context)
- "Sketching the form..." (building structure)
- "Shifting hues..." (applying colors)
- "Adding texture..." (layering components)
- "Full adaptation..." (final polish)

| **Heavy decoration**      | Data-dense pages, admin interfaces, forms          |
| **Particle effects**      | Performance-critical pages, accessibility concerns |
| **Seasonal colors**       | Brand-critical contexts needing consistent colors  |
| **Multiple glass layers** | Can cause blur performance issues                  |
| **Randomization**         | Content that needs to match between sessions       |
| **Complex forests**       | Mobile-first pages, simple informational content   |

---

## Example Adaptation

**User:** "Make this about page feel like Grove"

**Chameleon flow:**

1. **READ** — "Page is about the team's journey. Emotional tone: reflection. Season: Autumn (harvest). Decoration level: full."

2. **SKETCH** — "Load `references/layout-patterns.md`. Create glass card containers, sticky nav with `glass-surface`, layering formula in place."

3. **COLOR** — "Load `references/color-palette.md`. Import autumn palette (rust, ember, amber, gold), warm gradients, `autumnReds` for accent. Load `references/groveterm-system.md` for user-facing text."

4. **TEXTURE** — "Load `references/nature-components.md` and `references/glass-components.md`. Add randomized aspen/birch trees, `FallingLeavesLayer`, autumn birds (cardinals), Lucide icons."

5. **ADAPT** — "Responsive density, reduced-motion support, `GroveTerm` for 'Welcome, Wanderer' greeting, 44px touch targets, dark mode verified. Run `gw ci --affected`."
