# Gathering Architecture 🌲🦅

The drum echoes high in the canopy. The conductor stands below, orchestrating each animal's entrance. The Eagle soars in fresh air, seeing patterns without bias. The Crow arrives separately, challenging with no sympathy for the architect. The Swan receives a strengthened design, not a compromised one. The Elephant builds from a spec it trusts. Four isolated minds, four intentional models, one cathedral of code.

## When to Summon

- Designing new systems or services
- Major architectural decisions
- Refactoring core infrastructure
- Creating platforms that other features build upon
- When vision, challenge, specification, and implementation must flow in sequence

**IMPORTANT:** This gathering is a **conductor**. It never designs, challenges, specifies, or builds directly. It dispatches subagents — one per animal — each with isolated context and an intentional model. The conductor only manages handoffs and gate checks.

| ----- | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | 🦅 Eagle    | opus   | Design high-level architecture | Yes — sees only the system spec                           |
| 2     | 🐦‍⬛ Crow     | sonnet | Challenge the design           | Yes — sees architecture doc only, not Eagle's reasoning   |
| 3     | 🦢 Swan     | opus   | Write detailed specification   | Yes — sees strengthened architecture (Eagle + Crow fixes) |
| 4     | 🐘 Elephant | opus   | Build the foundation           | Yes — sees only Swan's spec                               |

### Phase 1: SUMMON

_The drum sounds. The canopy rustles..._

The conductor receives the architecture request and prepares the dispatch plan:

**Clarify the System:**

- What problem does this solve?
- What are the scale requirements?
- What are the constraints?
- What's the growth trajectory?

**Nature Metaphor:**

> "Every architecture needs a nature metaphor. What does this system resemble?
> Heartwood (core), Wisp (gentle guide), Porch (gathering place), or something else?"

**Infrastructure Abstractions:**

- Use `GroveDatabase`/`GroveStorage`/`GroveKV`/`GroveServiceBus` from Server SDK for portability
- Use Amber SDK (FileManager, QuotaManager) for user file management — not raw R2
- Use Rootwork utilities at all data boundaries

**Confirm with the human, then proceed.**

**Output:** System specification, dispatch plan confirmed.

---

### Phase 2: DESIGN (Eagle)

_The conductor signals. The Eagle rises..._

```
Agent(eagle, model: opus)
  Input:  system specification only
  Reads:  eagle-architect/SKILL.md + references (MANDATORY)
  Output: architecture overview document
```

Dispatch an **opus subagent** to design the architecture. The Eagle receives ONLY the system specification. It reads its own skill file and executes its full workflow.

**What the Eagle produces:**

- System boundaries and component interactions
- Technology choices with rationale
- Scale constraints and growth strategy
- Data flow diagrams
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Nature metaphor for the system

**Handoff to conductor:** Architecture overview document (structured, not conversational).

**Gate check:** Architecture document exists with: system boundaries, component diagram, technology choices, ADRs. If incomplete, resume Eagle with specific questions.

---

### Phase 3: CHALLENGE (Crow)

_The Crow perches. It tilts its head at what others won't question..._

```
Agent(crow, model: sonnet)
  Input:  architecture document ONLY (not Eagle's reasoning process)
  Reads:  crow-reason/SKILL.md (MANDATORY)
  Output: challenge report + strengthened design recommendations
```

Dispatch a **sonnet subagent** in Red Team mode against the Eagle's architecture. The Crow receives ONLY the architecture document — NOT the Eagle's internal reasoning. This isolation is intentional: the Crow should challenge the design on its own merits, not be persuaded by the architect's justifications.

**What the Crow challenges:**

- Assumptions that aren't proven
- Single points of failure
- Complexity that could be simpler
- Scale claims without evidence
- Missing failure modes
- Operational burden on a small team

**Handoff to conductor:** Challenge report (Roost summary) with specific recommendations. The conductor then decides which challenges require Eagle revision.

**Gate check:** Crow produced challenges with specific, actionable recommendations (not vague concerns). If challenges reveal fundamental design issues, resume Eagle with the Crow's findings for revision.

**Iteration:** If Eagle needs revision:

1. Resume Eagle with Crow's specific findings
2. Eagle produces revised architecture
3. Optionally resume Crow for re-challenge (max 2 iterations)

---

### Phase 4: SPECIFY (Swan)

_The Swan glides. Elegance meets precision..._

```
Agent(swan, model: opus)
  Input:  strengthened architecture (Eagle's doc + resolved Crow challenges)
  Reads:  swan-design/SKILL.md + references (MANDATORY)
  Output: complete technical specification
```

Dispatch an **opus subagent** to write the detailed specification. The Swan receives the architecture document as strengthened by the Crow's challenges — it sees the resolved design, not the debate.

**What the Swan produces:**

- API contracts (request/response formats)
- Database schema with relationships
- Flow diagrams for key operations
- Implementation checklist ordered by dependency
- Error handling patterns (Signpost codes)
- Configuration and deployment requirements

**Handoff to conductor:** Complete technical specification document.

**Gate check:** Specification has: API contracts, database schema, flow diagrams, implementation checklist. If missing sections, resume Swan.

---

### Phase 5: BUILD (Elephant)

_The ground trembles. The Elephant arrives..._

```
Agent(elephant, model: opus)
  Input:  Swan's technical specification ONLY
  Reads:  elephant-build/SKILL.md + references (MANDATORY)
  Output: built foundation + file list
```

Dispatch an **opus subagent** to build the architectural foundation. The Elephant receives ONLY the Swan's specification — not the Eagle's vision doc or Crow's challenges. The spec is the single source of truth for building.

**What the Elephant builds:**

- Database migrations and schema
- Core services and business logic
- API route skeletons with proper error handling
- Type definitions
- Essential tests for the foundation
- Configuration files

**Cross-cutting standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

- Signpost error codes on all error paths
- Rootwork type safety at all boundaries
- Engine-first pattern (check before duplicating)

**Handoff to conductor:** File list (every file created/modified), implementation summary, any deviations from spec.

**Gate check:**

```bash
pnpm install
gw dev ci --affected --fail-fast --diagnose
```

Must compile and pass. If it fails, resume Elephant with the error.

---

### Phase 6: CHORUS

_Dawn breaks. The architecture stands..._

The conductor runs final verification and presents the summary:

```bash
gw dev ci --affected --fail-fast --diagnose
```

**Completion Report:**

```

## Conductor Rules

### Never Do Animal Work

The conductor dispatches. It does not design, challenge, specify, or build.

### Fresh Eyes Are a Feature

Crow sees only the architecture document, not Eagle's reasoning. Elephant sees only Swan's spec, not the debate history. This isolation produces better results at every stage.

### Gate Every Transition

Verify output between every animal. Architecture must be complete before challenge. Challenges must be resolved before specification. Spec must be complete before building.

### Resume, Don't Restart

If a gate check fails or Crow reveals fundamental design issues, **resume** the relevant agent. Don't spawn new ones.

---

## Anti-Patterns

**The conductor does NOT:**

- Design architecture itself (dispatch Eagle)
- Soften Crow's challenges (pass them to Eagle unfiltered)
- Let Elephant see the design debate (only the final spec)
- Skip the Crow phase ("the design looks fine")
- Let agents skip reading their skill file
- Continue after a gate failure

## Quick Decision Guide

| Scope                            | Strategy                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| New system, full design needed   | All four: Eagle → Crow → Swan → Elephant        |
| Spec exists, need implementation | Elephant only (with spec as input)              |
| Design review, no implementation | Eagle → Crow → Swan (skip Elephant)             |
| Quick design, team will build    | Eagle → Crow (skip Swan + Elephant)             |
| Large foundation (20+ files)     | Multi-Elephant dispatch (see gathering-feature) |
