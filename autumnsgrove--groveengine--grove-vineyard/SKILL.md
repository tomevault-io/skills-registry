description: Build a Vineyard showcase page for any Grove property using @autumnsgrove/lattice/vineyard components. Vineyard is the consistent /vineyard route where each tool demos its features, documents its API, and shows its roadmap. Use when creating or updating a property's vineyard page. Use when this capability is needed.

# Grove Vineyard Skill

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when:

- Creating a `/vineyard` route for a Grove property
- Adding features or demos to an existing vineyard page
- User mentions "vineyard", "showcase page", or "tool demo page"
- Implementing feature cards, roadmaps, or demo containers for a tool

## What Is Vineyard?

Every Grove property implements a `/vineyard` route on its subdomain — a consistent way to explore what each tool does, see working demos, and understand the roadmap.

```
amber.grove.place/vineyard      → Storage showcase
ivy.grove.place/vineyard        → Email client showcase
foliage.grove.place/vineyard    → Theming showcase
meadow.grove.place/vineyard     → Social layer showcase
heartwood.grove.place/vineyard  → Auth showcase
forage.grove.place/vineyard     → Domain discovery showcase
```

## Package

Vineyard lives inside the Lattice monorepo at `libs/vineyard` and is re-exported through the engine. No separate install needed — it comes with Lattice.

```typescript
import { VineyardLayout, FeatureCard, StatusBadge, ... } from '@autumnsgrove/lattice/vineyard';
```

## Types

```typescript
type VineyardStatus = "ready" | "preview" | "demo" | "coming-soon" | "in-development";
type GroveTool =
	| "amber"
	| "ivy"
	| "foliage"
	| "meadow"
	| "rings"
	| "trails"
	| "heartwood"
	| "forage";
type GroveTier = "seedling" | "sapling" | "oak" | "grove";
```

## Minimal Implementation

Create `src/routes/vineyard/+page.svelte`:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import {
		VineyardLayout,
		FeatureCard,
		RoadmapSection,
		DemoContainer,
	} from "@autumnsgrove/lattice/vineyard";
</script>

<VineyardLayout tool="amber" tagline="Your files, preserved" status="preview">
	<!-- Feature Cards -->
	<div class="feature-grid">
		<FeatureCard
			title="Storage Overview"
			description="See usage across posts and media"
			status="ready"
			icon="HardDrive"
		/>

		<FeatureCard
			title="File Browser"
			description="Browse and manage uploaded files"
			status="ready"
			icon="FolderOpen"
		/>

		<FeatureCard
			title="Export Your Data"
			description="Download everything in one click"
			status="coming-soon"
			icon="Download"
		/>
	</div>

	<!-- Roadmap -->
	<RoadmapSection
		built={["Core storage view", "Usage breakdown", "File browser"]}
		inProgress={["Export functionality"]}
		planned={["Bulk delete", "Storage alerts", "External backup"]}
	/>
</VineyardLayout>

<style>
	.feature-grid {
		display: grid;
		grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
		gap: 1.5rem;
		margin-bottom: 3rem;
	}
</style>
```

## Component Details

### VineyardLayout

Handles the full page structure automatically:

- **Hero**: Tool name (capitalized from `tool` prop), tagline, status badge, philosophy quote
- **Content**: Renders children in a max-width container with padding
- **Footer**: "Works well with" section linking related tools' vineyards

```svelte
<VineyardLayout tool="ivy" tagline="Messages that grow on you" status="in-development">
	<!-- All your content goes here -->
</VineyardLayout>
```

The philosophy quotes and related tool mappings are built-in. No configuration needed.

### FeatureCard

Icons are any valid [@lucide/svelte](https://lucide.dev) icon name as a string:

```svelte
<FeatureCard
	title="Theme Picker"
	description="Choose from curated seasonal themes"
	status="ready"
	icon="Palette"
>
	{#snippet demo()}
		<!-- Optional: interactive demo renders below the description -->
		<ThemePicker themes={sampleThemes} />
	{/snippet}
</FeatureCard>
```

### DemoContainer

Wraps interactive demos with a header, description, and optional "Mock Data" indicator:

```svelte
<DemoContainer title="Email Composer" description="Try the rich text editor" mockData={true}>
	<RichTextEditor value={sampleDraft} />
</DemoContainer>
```

When `mockData={true}`:

- Shows a blue "Mock Data" pill in the header
- Adds a dashed blue border around the demo content

### CodeExample

Code blocks with copy-to-clipboard and language/filename labels:

```svelte
<CodeExample language="typescript" filename="src/routes/+layout.svelte">
	{`import { initAmber } from '@autumnsgrove/amber';

const storage = initAmber({
  tenant: 'my-site',
  tier: 'sapling'
});`}
</CodeExample>
```

### TierGate

Shows content only if user meets tier requirement. Otherwise shows blur preview + upgrade prompt:

```svelte
<TierGate required="oak" current={userTier} showPreview={true}>
	<AdvancedStoragePanel />

	{#snippet fallback()}
		<!-- Optional custom fallback (default shows upgrade button) -->
		<p>Upgrade to Oak for advanced storage features</p>
	{/snippet}
</TierGate>
```

Tier hierarchy: `seedling` < `sapling` < `oak` < `grove`

### RoadmapSection

Three-column (desktop) / stacked (mobile) timeline:

```svelte
<RoadmapSection
	built={["Feature A", "Feature B"]}
	inProgress={["Feature C"]}
	planned={["Feature D", "Feature E"]}
/>
```

- Built items get green dots
- In-progress items get pulsing orange dots
- Planned items get hollow gray circles

### Authentication

```svelte
<script>
	import { AuthButton, UserMenu, getSession } from "@autumnsgrove/lattice/vineyard";
	import { onMount } from "svelte";

	let user = $state(null);

	onMount(async () => {
		const session = await getSession();
		user = session.user;
	});
</script>

{#if user}
	<UserMenu showAvatar={true} showEmail={true} />
{:else}
	<AuthButton provider="google" signInText="Sign in to explore" />
{/if}
```

## Status Badge Meanings

| Status           | Visual              | Use When                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `ready`          | Green solid pill    | Feature is complete and stable     |
| `preview`        | Amber dashed border | Functional but API may change      |
| `demo`           | Blue solid pill     | Interactive example, not real data |
| `coming-soon`    | Gray subtle pill    | Designed but not built yet         |
| `in-development` | Orange pulsing pill | Actively being built right now     |

## Design System

Vineyard components use Grove's built-in aesthetic:

- **Colors**: Amber tones (#f59e0b, #d97706) on stone neutrals
- **Glass**: Semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop-blur
- **Typography**: Lexend font (loaded by VineyardLayout)
- **Interactions**: Hover lift on cards, smooth transitions

No additional styling framework needed — components are self-contained with scoped CSS.

## Content Strategy

### For Ready Tools

- Working demos with real or realistic mock data
- Complete feature cards with all statuses "ready"
- Full code examples and API reference
- Getting started guide

### For Preview/In Development Tools

- Mix of "ready" and "coming-soon" feature cards
- Demo containers with `mockData={true}`
- Roadmap section showing progress
- TierGate for features not yet available

### For Coming Soon Tools

- Minimal vineyard: VineyardLayout + philosophy + roadmap
- All feature cards as "coming-soon"
- No interactive demos needed yet

## Grove Terminology

When vineyard pages reference Grove-themed terms (tool names, feature names, user roles), use GroveTerm components to respect the user's Grove Mode setting. New visitors see standard terms by default.

```svelte
import {(GroveTerm, GroveText)} from '@autumnsgrove/lattice/ui'; import groveTermManifest from '$lib/data/grove-term-manifest.json';

<!-- Use GroveText for data-driven content with [[term]] syntax -->
<GroveText
	content="Manage your [[bloom|posts]] and [[garden|blog]] appearance."
	manifest={groveTermManifest}
/>

<!-- Or GroveTerm for individual interactive terms -->
<p>Customize how your <GroveTerm term="garden" manifest={groveTermManifest} /> looks.</p>
```

## Checklist

Before shipping a vineyard page:

- [ ] `VineyardLayout` with correct `tool`, `tagline`, and `status`
- [ ] At least 3 `FeatureCard` components with appropriate statuses
- [ ] `RoadmapSection` with honest built/inProgress/planned arrays
- [ ] At least one interactive demo (even with mock data)
- [ ] Works on mobile (feature grid responsive)
- [ ] Icons are valid @lucide/svelte names
- [ ] Status badges accurately reflect feature state
- [ ] Grove terminology uses GroveTerm components (not hardcoded)
