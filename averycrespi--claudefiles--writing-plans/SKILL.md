# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Save plans to:** `.plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**

- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

<header>
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use Skill(executing-plans) to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

---

</header>

## Task Structure

**Each task must following this structure:**

<task>
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**

- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```

</task>

## Documentation Task

Before writing tasks, scan the project's documentation files (README.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/, etc.) and identify which sections would become stale after the planned changes. Then:

- **If docs need updating:** Add a final task that updates the specific files and sections affected. This task follows the same structure as any other task — list the files, the sections to change, the new content, and a commit. It gets spec-reviewed and code-reviewed like everything else.
- **If no docs need updating** (e.g., pure internal refactor): Add a comment at the end of the plan: `<!-- No documentation updates needed -->` so it's a conscious decision, not an oversight.

## Remember

- Exact file paths always — but **always relative to the repo root**, never absolute paths
- **Never hardcode the repository's absolute path** (e.g., `/Users/alice/project`) anywhere in the plan — plans may be executed in worktrees at different paths
- Never include `cd /absolute/path` commands — use relative paths or assume the working directory is the repo root
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan:

- Commit the plan document to git

Then ask the user if they want to execute using `AskUserQuestion`:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion(
  questions: [{
    question: "Plan is ready. How would you like to proceed?",
    header: "Execute",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Execute with subagents (Recommended)", description: "Full isolation - best for complex plans or autonomous work" },
      { label: "Execute quickly", description: "Faster - does implementation and reviews in main context" },
      { label: "Don't execute", description: "Stop here - execute manually later" }
    ]
  }]
)
```

**Based on selection:**

**Execute with subagents:**

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use Skill(executing-plans)
- Dispatches subagents for implementation and reviews
- Best for complex plans or autonomous work

**Execute quickly:**

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use Skill(executing-plans-quickly)
- Does implementation and reviews inline in main context
- Best for simple plans or interactive sessions

**Don't execute:**

- Plan is saved for later execution
- User can invoke execution skills in any session
