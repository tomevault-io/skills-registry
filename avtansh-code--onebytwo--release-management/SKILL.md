# Release Management

## Version Strategy

| Component | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Version | SemVer `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` | `1.2.3` |
| Build number | Auto-incrementing integer | `42` |
| Flutter pubspec | `version: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+BUILD` | `version: 1.2.3+42` |

### When to Bump

| Level | When | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **MAJOR** | Breaking changes requiring data migration | Schema v1 → v2, auth flow rewrite |
| **MINOR** | New features (backward compatible) | Add itemized splitting, friend search |
| **PATCH** | Bug fixes, performance improvements | Fix rounding error, improve list scroll |

### Build Number

- Always increment build number on every release (even for same version).
- Android: `versionCode` in `build.gradle` (must be strictly increasing).
- iOS: `CFBundleVersion` (must be strictly increasing per version).
- Managed via `pubspec.yaml` `version` field — Flutter propagates to both platforms.

## Rollback Procedure

### App Rollback

1. Revert the version bump commit on `main`.
2. Google Play: Halt rollout in Play Console → promote previous version.
3. App Store: Remove current version from sale → previous version remains available.
4. Notify users via in-app banner if critical.

### Backend Rollback

```bash
# Rollback Cloud Functions to previous version
firebase functions:log --only <functionName>  # Check for errors first
gcloud functions deploy <functionName> --source=gs://...  # Redeploy previous

# Rollback Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project prod
# (from a commit with the previous rules version)
```

### Data Migration Rollback

- If a batch migration was run, prepare and test a reverse migration **before** running the forward migration.
- Keep `schemaVersion` tracking to know which documents have been migrated.
