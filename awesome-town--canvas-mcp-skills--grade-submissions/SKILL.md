# Grade Submissions

Grade every submission for a single Canvas assignment. Drafts scores + 1–2 sentences of feedback per submission, presents a review table, pushes to Canvas only after the teacher confirms.

> **Grades are not posted to students automatically.** The skill writes the grade to Canvas, but whether students *see* the grade is governed by the assignment's Canvas posting policy (manual vs automatic). If your assignment uses **manual posting**, grades remain hidden until you click Post Grades in Canvas yourself. The skill will tell you the posting policy before any writes happen.

## When to use

A teacher has a Canvas assignment with student submissions and wants AI-assisted grading. Common phrasings:

- "Grade this assignment: https://…/courses/123/assignments/456"
- "Grade the watershed quiz"
- "Score all submissions for the prototyping project"

## When NOT to use

- **No submissions yet** — the skill needs actual student work to grade.
- **You want to give per-comment feedback only, no scores** — that's a separate manual workflow; this skill always drafts a score (or uses rubric criteria).
- **Re-grading a single student** — call `grade_submission` / `grade_with_rubric` directly via the MCP.

## Prerequisites

- canvas-mcp installed and configured.
- For Google Docs/Slides submissions: the **Claude Drive MCP** (already authenticated in the Claude.ai / Claude Desktop session).
- For visual / image-heavy grading: file-upload submission type works best (the skill renders PDFs and images directly).

### A note on pseudonyms during grading

By default, the Canvas MCP returns pseudonymized student names (`Student 1`, `Student 2`, …) — that's the FERPA-safe default. **The grade itself uses the numeric Canvas `user_id`** (which is always real, never anonymized), so grades attach to the right student regardless of pseudonymization. But the *teacher* may want to see real names while grading to remember which student is which.

Two options for the teacher:

1. **Run `create_student_anonymization_map` first** — gets a real-name → pseudonym mapping for the course (visible only if `CANVAS_MCP_ALLOW_DEANONYMIZE=true` on the server). The teacher uses this as a local lookup while reviewing the draft.
2. **Set `CANVAS_MCP_ALLOW_DEANONYMIZE=true`** in the MCP server env temporarily — then submission responses include real names. Flip it back to `false` after the grading session.

If neither is done, the review table shows pseudonyms. That's fine for many workflows — the grades land on the right students regardless.

## Workflow

### 1. Parse the assignment URL

Extract `course_id` and `assignment_id` from a URL like `https://{host}/courses/{course_id}/assignments/{assignment_id}`. If the URL can't be parsed or the teacher gave plain numbers ("course 914, assignment 12345"), use those directly. Ask for clarification only if you genuinely can't tell.

### 2. Preflight checks

Call `get_assignment_details(course_identifier, assignment_id)`. Stop and surface clearly if:

- **Course is concluded** (`workflow_state: "completed"`) — grades can't be posted.
- **`points_possible` is 0** — offer feedback-only mode (submission comments, no scores).
- **No submissions** — nothing to grade; surface a message and exit.

Also check:

- **If a rubric is attached** (`assignment.rubric` is non-null), call `get_assignment_rubric_details` to load the full rubric: criteria, ratings (descriptions + points per level), `free_form_criterion_comments` flag, and `use_for_grading`. Cache this — you'll need it in steps 3, 5, 6, and 8. The skill grades per-criterion instead of by total points.
- **Posting policy** — read the assignment's `post_manually` flag (or `post_policy` if available). If `post_manually: true`, surface a clear warning in step 3 and step 7: grades will be written but hidden from students until the teacher posts manually in Canvas.

### 3. Present the assignment and ask how to grade

Show the teacher:

- Assignment name + Canvas URL
- Points possible
- Submission count (and how many are already graded — warn that re-grading overwrites)
- Posting policy (and what that means)

Then ask:

- **No rubric:** "This is worth `<N>` points. How would you like me to grade it?" (Wait for plain-language criteria.)
- **Rubric attached:** Show the rubric — each criterion's ratings + point values. Say: "I'll grade per-criterion using this rubric. Any extra guidance on top of it (e.g., weight criterion X harder)?" Mention whether `free_form_criterion_comments` is on or off — that affects whether per-criterion comments get drafted.

### 4. Fetch and filter submissions

Call `list_submissions(course_identifier, assignment_id, include_rubric_assessment: true, include_submission_comments: true)`. Skip unsubmitted students (`workflow_state: "unsubmitted"`). Auto-grade empty/blank submissions as `0` with the comment "No response provided." For each submission with content, collect:

- The **submission body** (text, URL, or attachment IDs depending on type)
- The **submission's `attempt`** number (you'll need this for step 8)
- Any **teacher-authored submission comments** (filter by `author_id` matching an instructor — students' own comments are NOT notes). Treat these as private grading evidence.

Then route each submission by `submission_type`:

#### `online_text_entry`

Use the `body` text directly. Strip HTML tags for grading; preserve the original for any quoting in feedback.

#### `online_url`

Detect and route the URL:

- **`docs.google.com/document/d/<FILE_ID>/...`** → extract `FILE_ID` from between `/d/` and the next `/`. Call `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Drive__read_file_content(file_id: FILE_ID)` to get the text. Grade the text content.
- **`docs.google.com/presentation/d/<FILE_ID>/...`** → same extraction. Call `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Drive__read_file_content(file_id: FILE_ID)` to get the slide text. **Note: the Drive MCP returns text only; slide images aren't included.** Grade the text + the slide structure (titles, bullet density, slide count). If the teacher needs visual grading (layout, design, imagery), tell them: "For visual evaluation, ask students to also submit a PDF export of their slides next time — that submission type renders the visuals natively."
- **`docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/...`** → skip with "Google Sheets not supported for AI grading — manual review needed."
- **Other URLs** → skip with "Non-Google URL — manual review needed."
- If the Drive MCP returns an error (e.g., file is restricted) → mark as "Could not access" in the review table; don't fail the whole batch.

#### `online_upload`

Use the `attachments[]` array from `list_submissions` output. For each attachment, call `download_submission_attachment(course_identifier, assignment_id, user_id, attachment_id?)` to save the file locally, then read it:

- **`.ipynb`** (Jupyter notebooks) → use the Read tool; it renders cells + outputs natively.
- **`.pdf`** → use the Read tool; it renders pages.
- **`.docx`** → extract text via `python3 -c "import docx; print('\n'.join(p.text for p in docx.Document('FILE').paragraphs))"`.
- **`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.md`** → use the Read tool as plain text.
- **`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`** → use the Read tool; images render visually.
- **Other file types** → skip with "File type not supported for AI grading — manual review needed."

#### Other submission types

Skip with a note. Common cases: `media_recording` (skip, manual review), `online_quiz` (already auto-graded by Canvas), `none`.

### 5. Grade each submission

Evaluate each fetched submission against the teacher's criteria. For Google Slides, evaluate text content + slide structure (titles, sequencing, bullet density). For uploaded images, evaluate what's actually in the image (layout, content, accuracy).

**No rubric:**

Assign a single score clamped to `[0, points_possible]`. Don't exceed the assignment max — ever.

**Rubric attached:**

For each criterion, pick the rating that best matches the work and record `{criterion_id, points, rating_id}`. Sum criterion points to get the total grade (this matches `points_possible` when the top rating is selected everywhere). If a criterion can't be assessed from the submission (e.g., participation, in-class delivery), **leave it ungraded in the draft and flag it for manual review** — don't guess. The review table should surface these explicitly.

**Use existing teacher notes as evidence.** If the submission has teacher-authored comments captured in step 4 (e.g., notes typed during a live presentation), treat them as primary evidence — they reflect what the teacher actually observed, which the submission artifact alone may not capture. Lean on them especially for criteria the artifact can't show (delivery, participation, Q&A, in-class behavior). When notes conflict with the artifact, **prefer the notes** and flag the conflict in the review table.

### 6. Draft feedback

Default feedback style: 1–2 sentences, direct, references something specific from the student's actual work. Address by first name when names are visible; otherwise use the pseudonym Canvas returned.

**No rubric:**

One overall comment per submission. 1–2 sentences. Reference specific things from the work, not vague generalities.

**Rubric attached, `free_form_criterion_comments: true`:**

Draft a per-criterion comment for every criterion. Two sentences:

1. *Why this rating?* Reference something specific from their work.
2. *How to reach the next rating up?* Concrete, actionable. If they already earned the top rating, replace with brief reinforcement ("keep doing X").

**Rubric attached, `free_form_criterion_comments: false`:**

Don't draft per-criterion comments — Canvas uses the rating descriptions for those. Draft a single 1–2 sentence overall comment instead.

**Fold in the teacher's notes from step 4.** When a submission had teacher comments, weave their concrete observations into the drafted feedback (e.g., a note like "rushed the Q&A" should appear in the relevant criterion comment or overall comment). Don't quote the notes verbatim — they're often shorthand. Rewrite into student-facing prose.

**No voice / tone passes.** This skill leaves feedback in its default form. If the teacher wants their personal writing style applied, that's a separate manual step they do themselves — don't try to mimic a specific teacher's voice unless asked.

### 7. Present results for review

Show a summary table:

| user_id | Student | Type | Score | Feedback (truncated) | Teacher notes (if any) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1001 | Student 1 | text | 8 / 10 | Strong watershed examples, but missing evapotranspiration. | — |
| 1002 | Student 2 | google_doc | 9 / 10 | Clear diagrams + solid analysis. | rushed conclusion |

Also show:

- **Average + range** of scores.
- **Skipped submissions** (and why) listed separately.
- **Ungraded criteria** (rubric grading only) — submissions where one or more criteria couldn't be assessed and need manual review.
- **Posting policy reminder** — "These grades will be written to Canvas but [hidden from students until you Post Grades manually | visible to students immediately]."

The teacher can:

- Adjust individual grades or feedback in natural language ("change Student 4 to 9 — they did mention the cycle")
- Re-grade everything with different criteria
- Approve the batch to push

**Rubric grading** review table shows per-criterion ratings compactly (e.g., `Evidence: Proficient (3/4); Clarity: Developing (2/4)`) and either per-criterion comments or the overall comment depending on the rubric setting. The teacher can edit any rating, any comment, or the whole row.

**Existing comments warning:** if the assignment uses manual posting and grades are currently hidden, posting grades will *also* reveal any existing teacher comments that were on those submissions. List which submissions are affected and ask whether to keep, edit, or delete them in Canvas first. **The skill does not delete comments — the teacher does that in Canvas if needed.**

### 8. Push grades

Always **dry-run first**, regardless of grading mode.

**No rubric — bulk_grade_submissions:**

```
bulk_grade_submissions(
  course_identifier,
  assignment_id,
  grades: {
    "1001": { posted_grade: 8, comment: "Strong watershed examples..." },
    "1002": { posted_grade: 9, comment: "Clear diagrams + solid analysis." }
  },
  dry_run: true
)
```

Show the would-be payloads. On teacher confirmation, call again with `dry_run: false` to actually post.

**Rubric attached — grade_submission_with_rubric per submission:**

For each submission, call:

```
grade_submission_with_rubric(
  course_identifier,
  assignment_id,
  user_id: 1001,
  rubric_assessment: {
    "_8027": { points: 3, comments: "..." },
    "_8028": { points: 4, comments: "..." }
  },
  comment: "<overall comment, if drafted>"
)
```

There's no dry-run for the rubric tool, so do a manual dry-run first: print the per-submission rubric_assessment payloads to the teacher BEFORE making any tool calls. On confirmation, send them sequentially or in small batches; report any failures and offer to retry.

**Posting against the latest attempt.** When `list_submissions` returns a submission, you captured its `attempt` field in step 4 — that's the latest attempt. Comments must anchor to that attempt, not an older one. If the grading tool doesn't expose an `attempt` parameter (currently it doesn't), verify after pushing by re-fetching the submission and checking that the new rubric assessment + comment are visible on the latest attempt. If they landed on an older attempt, stop and surface this — the student won't see them in their current submission view.

### 9. Report results

After the push:

> Graded N submissions on **Watershed Unit Test** (course DSGN 9).
> Average: 7.4 / 10. Range: 4–10. 2 submissions skipped (manual review).
>
> Grades are now in Canvas. The assignment uses **manual posting** — students cannot see their grades or comments yet. To release them, open the assignment in Canvas and click **Post Grades**.
>
> [Or, for auto-post assignments:]
>
> The assignment uses **auto-posting** — students can see their grades and comments now.

If any pushes failed, list them with the user_id, the error message, and offer to retry.

## Feedback style

Default: 1–2 sentences, direct, references something specific from the student's actual work. Use contractions. Avoid generalities ("good job", "needs improvement" with no specifics). For Slides: comment on the text content + structure (titles, bullets, sequence) — visual layout grading requires the teacher to ask for it explicitly with a PDF export.

**No voice or tone matching.** Feedback stays in the default form unless the teacher explicitly says "rewrite in my voice" — at which point that's the teacher's manual step, not the skill's.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Never exceed `points_possible`.** Clamp single-score grades to `[0, points_possible]`. For rubric grading, each criterion's points must match one of the rubric's ratings — don't invent in-between values unless the rubric explicitly allows free-form points.
- **Always dry-run first.** Show the teacher the would-be payloads before any real write. The teacher must explicitly say "go ahead" (or equivalent) before you flip `dry_run: false` or send the rubric writes.
- **Don't guess on un-assessable criteria.** If a rubric criterion measures something the submission artifact doesn't show (delivery, participation), leave it ungraded in the draft and flag for manual review. Guessing here produces worse-than-useless feedback.
- **Don't quote teacher notes verbatim.** They're shorthand. Rewrite into student-facing prose when folding them into feedback.
- **Don't push grades that land on stale attempts.** Verify via re-fetching the submission after the push that the rubric assessment and comment landed on the latest `attempt`.
- **Don't mimic a teacher's voice.** Default feedback only. Voice/tone matching is the teacher's manual step.
- **Don't fail the whole batch on one stuck submission.** Google Drive access errors, file-type-not-supported, etc. should mark the affected submission as skipped and continue.
- **Don't delete student or teacher comments.** If existing comments will be revealed by posting grades, surface them to the teacher and let them clean up in Canvas.

## Example

**Teacher:** "Grade this assignment: https://franklinjc.instructure.com/courses/914/assignments/12345"

**What happens:**

1. Skill parses: course 914, assignment 12345.
2. `get_assignment_details` → 10-point assignment "Watershed Quiz", no rubric, 24 submissions, manual posting policy.
3. Skill: "This is a 10-point quiz, no rubric attached, 24 submissions, manual posting (grades stay hidden until you Post Grades in Canvas). How would you like me to grade it?"
4. Teacher: "Full credit for naming all 3 stages of the water cycle, minus 3 for each missing."
5. `list_submissions` → 24 submissions: 18 text, 5 Google Docs, 1 Google Slides.
6. Drive MCP reads the Docs + Slides; skill grades each; flags 2 with empty submissions as `0`.
7. Skill presents review table — average 7.8/10, range 0–10.
8. Teacher adjusts 2 scores, approves.
9. `bulk_grade_submissions` with `dry_run: true` → confirms payloads.
10. `bulk_grade_submissions` with `dry_run: false` → grades posted.
11. Skill: "Graded 24 submissions. Average 7.7/10. Grades are in Canvas but hidden — open the assignment and click **Post Grades** to release them to students."
