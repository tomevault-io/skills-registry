# Git Workflow

Use these conventions when working with version control, creating branches, writing commits, or resolving merge conflicts.

## Plugins for Git Work

| Plugin | When to Use |
|---|---|
| `commit-commands:commit` | Create conventional commits — handles staging, message formatting, and pre-commit checks |
| `commit-commands:commit-push-pr` | Commit, push, and open a PR in one flow |
| `commit-commands:clean_gone` | Clean up local branches that have been deleted on remote (marked `[gone]`), including worktrees |
| `github` | Create PRs, link issues, add labels, request reviewers, post comments on GitHub |
| `gitlab` | Same capabilities for GitLab-hosted repos |

**Prefer plugins over raw git commands** for:
- Committing — `commit-commands:commit` enforces conventional commit format
- PR creation — `github`/`gitlab` plugin handles the full flow (create PR, set labels, link issues)
- Branch cleanup — `commit-commands:clean_gone` safely removes stale branches and worktrees

## Commit Messages

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Good: `feat(auth): add OAuth2 support for GitHub login`
Bad: `fixed stuff`

## Branch Naming

```
<type>/<ticket>-<description>
```

Examples:
- `feature/PROJ-123-user-authentication`
- `fix/PROJ-456-null-pointer-crash`
- `hotfix/PROJ-789-security-patch`

## Non-Interactive Git

All git commands must be non-interactive (see `rules/execution-hygiene.md`):

```bash
# Always use --no-pager or GIT_PAGER=cat
git --no-pager log -10
git --no-pager diff
GIT_PAGER=cat git show HEAD

# Commit with message (never open editor)
git commit -m "feat(auth): add login endpoint"

# Merge without editor
git merge --no-edit feature-branch

# Rebase non-interactively
git rebase --no-edit main
```

## Common Operations

```bash
# Squash last N commits (non-interactive)
git reset --soft HEAD~N && git commit -m "squashed commit message"

# Cherry-pick specific commit
git cherry-pick <sha>

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Find commit that introduced bug
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good <known-good-sha>

# Stash with description
git stash push -m "WIP: auth middleware"
git stash pop
```

## Merge Conflict Resolution

1. `git status` — identify conflicted files
2. Open file, look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
3. Keep correct code, remove markers
4. `git add <file>` then `git rebase --continue` or `git merge --continue`

When resolving conflicts, investigate both sides before choosing — the conflicting code may represent someone else's in-progress work.

## Pre-Commit Checks

Always run before pushing:
- Linting/formatting
- Unit tests
- Type checking (if applicable)

```bash
# Example pre-push verification
npm run lint && npm test && npx tsc --noEmit && git push
```

## Worktrees

For isolated feature work (used by `superpowers:using-git-worktrees`):

```bash
# Create a worktree for isolated feature work
git worktree add ../project-feature feature/PROJ-123-description

# List active worktrees
git worktree list

# Clean up after merge (or use commit-commands:clean_gone)
git worktree remove ../project-feature
```

Worktrees are useful when `fullstack-agent` orchestrates parallel task groups that need file-level isolation beyond what the task ownership rules provide.

## Agent Integration

- `fullstack-agent` creates feature branches before starting spec-driven work
- `coding-agent` and `devops-agent` commit their changes with conventional commit messages matching the task scope
- All agents use `--no-pager` and `GIT_PAGER=cat` for non-interactive output
- `review-agent` may use `git diff` to identify the exact changeset under review
- After all review cycles pass, use `commit-commands:commit-push-pr` or `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` to handle merge/PR creation
- Use `github`/`gitlab` plugin to link PRs to issues and add reviewers
