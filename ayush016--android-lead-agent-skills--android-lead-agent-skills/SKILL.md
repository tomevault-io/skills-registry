## Core Engineering Principles

**1. Unidirectional Data Flow, No Exceptions**
State flows down from ViewModel. Events flow up via lambdas or actions. No composable reads from a database. No ViewModel imports Compose. The boundary is sharp and testable.

**2. Clean Architecture as a Dependency Rule**
Domain has zero Android imports. Data is invisible to UI. Features depend on core, never each other. Violations create debt that compounds faster than feature velocity.

**3. UI Excellence Is Not Optional**
Producing a visually mediocre screen is an engineering failure. Default grey scaffolds, hardcoded colors, missing transitions, and spinners as primary loading states are incomplete work.

**4. Shared Element Transitions Are the Default for Content Navigation**
Tapping a card must cause the card to flow into its detail. `sharedBounds()` or `sharedElement()` is the default. Opt out only when there is genuinely no spatial relationship to express.

**5. Physics Over Timing**
`spring()` over `tween()` for gesture-coupled and state-change animations. Tune `stiffness` and `dampingRatio` deliberately — defaults are starting points, not final choices.

**6. The 4dp Spacing Grid Is a Contract**
Every spacing value is a multiple of 4dp, referenced via `AppSpacing.*` tokens. Arbitrary values are bugs that accumulate into visual dissonance.

**7. Fakes Over Mocks**
Test ViewModels against in-memory fake implementations. Fakes exercise real contracts, survive refactors. Mocks couple tests to implementation details and silently pass when production code breaks.

**8. Performance Is a Feature**
Baseline Profiles are committed for every app shipped. Recomposition counts are checked with Layout Inspector before any UI work is done. Cold start is tracked in CI via Macrobenchmark.

**9. Security from Day One**
Encrypted storage for all sensitive data. Certificate pinning for all network endpoints. No secrets in source code. Input validated at every external boundary. These are not features to add later.

**10. Accessibility Is Not Optional**
Every image has a content description. Every custom component declares its semantic role. Every interactive element has a 48dp touch target. Colour contrast meets WCAG AA. TalkBack is tested before any screen is shipped.

## ★ THE EXTRAORDINARY UI MANDATE ★

Android users have seen a million apps. The ones they remember have something alive about them — a transition that makes content feel like a physical object moving through space, surfaces that catch light at different elevations, a loading state so well crafted it does not feel like waiting.

**The Bar.** Every screen passes three tests before it ships:

1. **The scroll-stop test.** Would a designer pause on this if scrolling past it? Not because it is garish — because something is considered. A hierarchy that breathes. A transition that reveals spatial relationship. A surface treatment that says "we care."

2. **The feel test.** Does it respond to touch like a physical object? Spring physics on press, haptic coordination with state changes, skeleton loaders that mirror real content — these are what separate an app people recommend from one people tolerate.

3. **The motion test.** Do transitions communicate where content came from? Shared elements communicate spatial memory. Instant cuts communicate nothing. Slide transitions say you moved sideways. Shared elements say: this is that thing, grown.

**In code, this means:**
- Shared element transitions for every navigation between related content — always
- `spring()` physics tuned for each context; no unexamined defaults
- Color exclusively from Material 3 roles; `Brush` gradients where flat color is visually weak
- A display typeface for headlines paired with a humanist sans for body
- Skeleton screens mirroring the exact geometry of real content — no centred spinners
- Edge-to-edge always; status bar and nav bar are part of the design
- `Canvas` for anything standard components cannot achieve
- Haptic feedback coordinated with meaningful state transitions

**Anti-patterns to refuse:** Default grey scaffold backgrounds. Hardcoded hex colors in composables. Instant navigation between related content. `LinearProgressIndicator` as the sole loading state. Cards with identical elevation everywhere. Spacing not on the 4dp grid.

## Shared Element Transitions — Overview

`SharedTransitionLayout` coordinates geometry between composable trees during navigation. `sharedElement()` matches identical content (image in list → same image in detail). `sharedBounds()` matches composables sharing a spatial region (card → full screen).

Three things must thread down: `SharedTransitionScope`, `AnimatedVisibilityScope`, and a stable entity-ID key. Missing any one silently breaks the transition.

## Android MCP Integration

MCP = eyes on device. Code = hands in codebase. Build → install → screenshot → compare → refine. Catches what Roborazzi misses: real inset behaviour, animation timing, system bar styling, density quirks.

## Feature Build Workflow

1. **Module** — Create with `yourapp.android.library.compose` plugin. [`build-and-modules.md`](references/build-and-modules.md)
2. **Routes** — `@Serializable` data class in `:core:navigation`. [`navigation.md`](references/navigation.md)
3. **UI State** — Sealed interface: `Loading`, `Ready(data)`, `Error(message, canRetry)`. [`architecture.md`](references/architecture.md)
4. **Actions** — Sealed interface for all user interactions.
5. **ViewModel** — `StateFlow` + `SharedFlow(replay=0)` + `SavedStateHandle.toRoute()`. [`architecture.md`](references/architecture.md)
6. **Domain** — UseCase → Repository interface → impl in `:core:data`. [`data-layer.md`](references/data-layer.md)
7. **Composables** — Public screen + private sub-composables; `AppSpacing`, `colorScheme`, `typography` only. [`compose-ui-system.md`](references/compose-ui-system.md)
8. **Shared elements** — `sharedElement()` or `sharedBounds()` with stable ID keys. [`shared-element-transitions.md`](references/shared-element-transitions.md)
9. **Motion** — Stagger entry, spring state changes, enter/exit transitions. [`motion-and-animation.md`](references/motion-and-animation.md)
10. **Skeleton loading** — Mirror `Ready` geometry with `ShimmerBox`. [`compose-ui-system.md`](references/compose-ui-system.md)
11. **Adaptive** — Verify on 600dp+; apply `WindowSizeClass`-aware layout. [`adaptive-layouts.md`](references/adaptive-layouts.md)
12. **Accessibility** — Semantics, content descriptions, focus order, 48dp targets. [`accessibility.md`](references/accessibility.md)
13. **Security** — No secrets; input validated at all external boundaries. [`security.md`](references/security.md)
14. **MCP review** — Screenshot in light/dark/large font/RTL; check insets + transitions. [`android-mcp.md`](references/android-mcp.md)
15. **Tests** — ViewModel unit tests + Roborazzi screenshots. [`testing.md`](references/testing.md)
16. **UI excellence** — Every item in [`assets/ui-excellence-checklist.md`](assets/ui-excellence-checklist.md) must pass.

## Common Pitfalls

**1. Hardcoded colors** — `Color.White` in a composable. Fix: all colors via `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.*`.

**2. Missing `modifier` parameter** — Composable cannot be resized by caller. Fix: every public composable takes `modifier: Modifier = Modifier` on its outermost layout.

**3. SharedFlow vs StateFlow for events** — Toast fires again on rotation. Fix: events = `MutableSharedFlow(replay=0)`. State = `MutableStateFlow(initial)`.

**4. Shared element key mismatch** — Navigation works but no transition fires. Fix: build from stable entity ID. Log both sides and compare.

**5. SharedTransitionLayout not wrapping NavHost** — `IllegalStateException: No SharedTransitionScope`. Fix: `SharedTransitionLayout { NavHost { } }` — must contain both source and destination.

**6. Missing renderInSharedTransitionScope** — Back button blinks into existence at transition end. Fix: apply `.renderInSharedTransitionScope(scope).animateEnterExit(...)` to destination-only elements.

**7. Blocking main thread** — ANR or UI freeze. Fix: `withContext(dispatchers.io)` for all I/O; never `runBlocking` on the main dispatcher.

**8. Spinner as only loading state** — `CircularProgressIndicator` centred on a blank background. Fix: `ShimmerBox` composable mirroring `Ready` geometry.

**9. Non-4dp spacing** — Visual rhythm feels slightly off; design review flags it. Fix: `AppSpacing.*` for every spacing value.

**10. collectAsState instead of collectAsStateWithLifecycle** — Flow collects in background. Fix: always `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` for UI-bound collection.

**11. GlobalScope usage** — Coroutine leaks, ignores cancellation. Fix: `viewModelScope`, `lifecycleScope`, or `rememberCoroutineScope()`. Never `GlobalScope`.

**12. Images loaded at full resolution for thumbnails** — OOM in lists. Fix: `.size(width, height)` in `ImageRequest` matching display dimensions.
