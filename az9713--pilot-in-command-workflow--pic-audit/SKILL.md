# PIC Audit Viewer

<pic-audit>

Display comprehensive audit trail for a workflow, including agent executions, tool usage, and complete decision-making history.

## Usage

- `/pic-audit` - Show audit summary for current workflow
- `/pic-audit WF-XXX` - Show audit for specific workflow
- `/pic-audit WF-XXX research` - Show detailed audit for specific phase

## Implementation

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Check if audit log exists**:
   ```bash
   # Read the audit log
   cat .pic/audit-log.jsonl
   ```

2. **Get current workflow** (if no workflow specified):
   ```bash
   # Get workflow ID from state
   cat .pic/state.json | grep -oP '"workflow"\s*:\s*"\K[^"]+'
   ```

3. **Display audit summary**:
   - Count events by type (agent_start, agent_complete, tool_use, decision, handoff, conflict, error)
   - Show timeline of agent executions with timestamps
   - Display tool usage statistics
   - List decision points

4. **For detailed phase view**:
   ```bash
   # Read phase-specific audit files
   cat .pic/audit/WF-XXX/[phase]-input.json
   cat .pic/audit/WF-XXX/[phase]-full.json
   ```

Audit settings in `.pic/config.json`:

```json
{
  "audit": {
    "enabled": true,
    "captureFullOutput": true,
    "maxOutputLength": 50000,
    "captureToolUsage": true,
    "retentionDays": 30
  }
}
```
