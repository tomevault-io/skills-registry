# Implementing

## Overview

Execute an existing blueprint exactly as written, with verification and
checkpoints. If the blueprint is wrong or unclear, stop and ask to change it.

## When to Use

- An implementation blueprint exists and is approved
- The work needs disciplined, step-by-step execution

Skip if: there is no blueprint (write one first) or the task is trivial.

## Quick Reference

1. Read the full blueprint.
2. Call out blockers or questions.
3. Track progress per task.
4. Verify each task before moving on.
5. Check in after a small batch.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Load the blueprint**
   - Read end to end.
   - Identify unclear steps or missing info.

2. **Confirm before starting**
   - If anything is unclear, ask and wait.
   - Do not "fix" the blueprint silently.

3. **Execute tasks in order**
   - One task at a time.
   - Follow steps exactly.
   - Run the listed verification.
   - Mark the task complete.

4. **Checkpoint**
   - After 2-3 tasks (or any risky task), summarize:
     - What changed
     - Verification results
     - Open questions
   - Wait for approval before continuing.

5. **Finish**
   - Run any final verification from the blueprint.
   - Report completion and remaining risks.

## Rules

- Do not add scope or extra features
- Do not reorder tasks unless the blueprint says so
- Stop and ask if blocked or if verification fails

## Delegate

- Use **implementer** agent for code changes per task
- Use **test-writer** agent if tests are missing
- Use **code-reviewer** agent after completion

Pipeline: discovering → researching → blueprinting → **implementing** →
code-review

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping verification to "save time"
- Changing the blueprint without approval
- Executing multiple tasks in parallel without permission
