# Real Estate Investment Analysis

Comprehensive real estate investment analysis — from deal screening through financial modeling to investor-ready output. Covers all property types, standard and advanced metrics, code generation, and tax-aware structuring.

## Analysis Workflow

Follow this 6-step process for any deal or market analysis:

1. **Define scope** — Identify property type, investment strategy, and target output format
2. **Gather data** — Collect property financials, market data, and comps (use API reference if automating)
3. **Build pro forma** — Construct income statement: Gross Rent → Vacancy → EGI → OpEx → NOI → Debt Service → Cash Flow
4. **Calculate returns** — Apply appropriate metrics (see Quick Reference below)
5. **Stress test** — Run sensitivity analysis, scenarios, or Monte Carlo simulation
6. **Report** — Generate investor-ready output with recommendations

## Quick Reference — Core Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Typical Range |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **NOI** | Effective Gross Income - Operating Expenses | Varies by asset |
| **Cap Rate** | NOI / Property Value | 4-10% (market-dependent) |
| **Cash-on-Cash** | Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested | 8-12% target |
| **DSCR** | NOI / Annual Debt Service | 1.2x+ (lender minimum) |
| **IRR** | Discount rate zeroing NPV of all cash flows | 15-20% target |
| **Equity Multiple** | Total Distributions / Total Capital Invested | 2.0x+ over hold |
| **GRM** | Property Price / Annual Gross Rent | 8-15 (lower = better) |
| **Break-even Occ.** | (OpEx + Debt Service) / Potential Gross Income | <85% preferred |

## Property Type Router

Select the analysis framework based on property type:

| Property Type | Key Metrics | Rules of Thumb | Reference |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **SFR / Small Multi (1-4)** | CoC, Cap Rate, DSCR | 1% rule, 50% rule, 70% rule | `references/property-types.md` §Residential |

| **Large Multifamily (5+)** | Per-unit metrics, NOI, Cap Rate | OpEx ratio 35-45% | `references/property-types.md` §Commercial |
| **Commercial (Office/Retail)** | Per-SF metrics, lease analysis | NNN vs Gross lease impact | `references/property-types.md` §Commercial |
| **Short-Term Rental** | RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy | Revenue = ADR x Occ x 365 - fees | `references/property-types.md` §STR |
| **Land / Development** | Absorption rate, dev pro forma | Total cost vs projected value | `references/property-types.md` §Land |

## Analysis Type Router

Select the analysis methodology based on what the user needs:

| Need | Method | Reference File |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Run the numbers on a deal | Pro forma + core metrics | `references/financial-metrics.md` |
| Stress test assumptions | Sensitivity analysis (bear/base/bull) | `references/advanced-analysis.md` §Sensitivity |
| Model uncertainty/risk | Monte Carlo simulation | `references/advanced-analysis.md` §MonteCarlo |
| Syndication distributions | Waterfall modeling (GP/LP splits) | `references/advanced-analysis.md` §Waterfall |
| Compare/score markets | Market scoring framework | `references/market-analysis.md` §Scoring |
| Pull market data via API | API integration patterns | `references/market-analysis.md` §APIs |
| Find and adjust comps | Comparable analysis | `references/market-analysis.md` §Comps |
| Optimize tax impact | Depreciation, cost seg, 1031 | `references/tax-strategy.md` |
| Choose entity structure | LLC, LP, S-Corp comparison | `references/tax-strategy.md` §Entity |

## Output Format Selection

Adapt output to the user's request:

**Spreadsheet-ready** — Generate formatted tables with formulas. Use pandas DataFrames exported to CSV/Excel. Include Excel formula equivalents for each calculation.

**Decision framework** — Provide structured narrative analysis with go/no-go recommendation. Include risk factors, key assumptions, and sensitivity ranges.

**Code generation** — Produce Python scripts using numpy-financial and pandas. Include complete, runnable pro forma models, Monte Carlo simulators, or waterfall calculators.

**Investor report** — Combine all three: executive summary, financial tables, risk analysis, and appendix with methodology.

## Operating Expense Benchmarks by Property Type

| Property Type | OpEx Ratio (% of EGI) | Management Fee |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Single-Family Rental | 35-50% | 8-10% |
| Small Multifamily (2-4) | 35-45% | 8-10% |
| Large Multifamily (5+) | 35-45% | 5-8% |
| Office | 35-55% | 3-5% |

## Audience Adaptation

- **Beginner investors**: Explain metric meanings, recommend starting with the 1% rule and cash-on-cash return, walk through pro forma line by line
- **Experienced investors**: Skip basics, lead with IRR and equity multiple, provide code/spreadsheet output, focus on sensitivity analysis and tax optimization
- Default to **expert-level analysis** unless context suggests otherwise
