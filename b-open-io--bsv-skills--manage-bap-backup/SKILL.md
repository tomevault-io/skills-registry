# Manage BAP Backup

Export and import BAP identity backups using the `bsv-bap` library.

## Installation

```bash
bun add bsv-bap @bsv/sdk
```

## Backup Format

Contains everything needed to reconstruct all identities:

```json
{
  "rootPk": "L4vB5...",        // Master key WIF (Type42) or xprv (BIP32)
  "ids": "<encrypted string>", // All identity metadata, encrypted with master
  "label": "optional",
  "createdAt": "2026-03-13T..."
}
```

The encrypted `ids` blob contains: name, description, identityKey (BAP ID), identityAttributes, and paths.

## Export Master Backup

```typescript
import { BAP } from "bsv-bap";

const bap = new BAP({ rootPk: storedWif });
bap.importIds(encryptedIds);

const backup = bap.exportForBackup("My Identity");
// { rootPk: "L1SJ...", ids: "QklFMQ...", createdAt: "..." }

import { writeFileSync } from "node:fs";
writeFileSync("backup.json", JSON.stringify(backup, null, 2));
```

## Import Master Backup

```typescript
import { BAP } from "bsv-bap";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

const backup = JSON.parse(readFileSync("backup.json", "utf-8"));
const bap = new BAP({ rootPk: backup.rootPk });
if (backup.ids) {
  bap.importIds(backup.ids);
}

const idKeys = bap.listIds();
const identity = bap.getId(idKeys[0]);
console.log(identity.idName, identity.getIdentityKey());
```

## List Accounts

```typescript
const idKeys = bap.listIds();

for (const key of idKeys) {
  const identity = bap.getId(key);
  console.log(`${identity.idName}: ${key}`);
  console.log(`  Root: ${identity.rootAddress}`);
  console.log(`  Current: ${identity.getCurrentAddress()}`);
}
```

## Encrypted Backups (.bep)

For encrypted backup files using AES-256-GCM, use the `bitcoin-backup` CLI:

```bash
bun add -g bitcoin-backup

# Encrypt a backup
bbackup enc backup.json -p "password" -o identity.bep

# Decrypt a backup
bbackup dec identity.bep -p "password" -o decrypted.json
```

See **`encrypt-decrypt-backup`** skill for full bitcoin-backup reference.

## CLI Option

For quick operations, use the `bap` CLI:

```bash
bun add -g bsv-bap

bap export              # Export identity JSON to stdout
bap export > backup.json
bap import backup.json  # Import from file
bap info                # View current identity
```

### Secure Enclave Protection (macOS arm64)

On macOS arm64, the BAP CLI can protect the master key with the Secure Enclave via `@1sat/vault`. When Touch ID protection is enabled (`bap touchid enable`), the `rootPk` is encrypted with a hardware-bound P-256 key and removed from disk. All backup/export operations that need the master key will trigger Touch ID. Use `bap touchid status` to check protection state. Set `BAP_NO_TOUCHID=1` for headless/CI environments.

## Master vs Member Backups

BAP supports two backup levels with different capabilities:

| Backup Type | Contains | Can Derive New IDs? | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Master** | rootPk (Type42) or xprv (legacy) + ids | Yes | Full identity management, key rotation |
| **Member** | Single derived WIF + encrypted identity data | No | Delegated access, agent auth, app-scoped signing |

### Member Backup Export

`exportMemberBackup()` produces a `MemberIdentity` with:
- `derivedPrivateKey` — the stable member key WIF (from rootPath, never changes)
- `address` — the current signing address (changes on rotation)
- `counter` — rotation counter for the signing key derivation
- `identityKey` — the BAP identity key

### Stable Member Key

The member key is the **stable identity anchor** for authentication:

```typescript
import { getStableMemberWif, getStableMemberPubkey } from "./bap/utils";

// These stay fixed even after key rotation
const wif = getStableMemberWif(identity);    // For auth token signing
const pubkey = getStableMemberPubkey(identity); // For identity resolution
```

Auth tokens (bitcoin-auth) are signed with the stable member WIF, not the rotating signing key. This ensures identity continuity across rotations.
