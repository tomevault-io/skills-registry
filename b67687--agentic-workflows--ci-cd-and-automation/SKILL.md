# CI/CD and Automation

**Companion script:** `scripts/ci-check.sh` --- CI configuration scanning, pipeline templates, and quality gate checklists.
```bash
bash ./scripts/ci-check.sh check                  # scan for CI config
bash ./scripts/ci-check.sh template gh-actions    # GitHub Actions workflow
bash ./scripts/ci-check.sh template gitlab-ci     # GitLab CI config
bash ./scripts/ci-check.sh gates                  # quality gate checklist
```

## Overview

Automate quality gates so that no change reaches production without passing tests, lint, type checking, and build. CI/CD is the enforcement mechanism for every other skill --- it catches what humans and agents miss, and it does so consistently on every single change.

**Shift Left:** Catch problems as early in the pipeline as possible. A bug caught in linting costs minutes; the same bug caught in production costs hours. Move checks upstream --- static analysis before tests, tests before staging, staging before production.

**Faster is Safer:** Smaller batches and more frequent releases reduce risk, not increase it. A deployment with 3 changes is easier to debug than one with 30. Frequent releases build confidence in the release process itself.

## When to Use

- Setting up a new project's CI pipeline
- Adding or modifying automated checks
- Configuring deployment pipelines
- When a change should trigger automated verification
- Debugging CI failures

## The Quality Gate Pipeline

Every change goes through these gates before merge:

```
Pull Request Opened
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   LINT CHECK     │  eslint, prettier
│   v pass         │
│   TYPE CHECK     │  tsc --noEmit
│   v pass         │
│   UNIT TESTS     │  jest/vitest
│   v pass         │
│   BUILD          │  npm run build
│   v pass         │
│   INTEGRATION    │  API/DB tests

│   E2E (optional) │  Playwright/Cypress

│   v pass         │
│   BUNDLE SIZE    │  bundlesize check
└─────────────────┘

```

**No gate can be skipped.** If lint fails, fix lint --- don't disable the rule. If a test fails, fix the code --- don't skip the test.

## GitHub Actions Configuration

### Basic CI Pipeline

Load the CI pipeline template (L3):
`bash ./scripts/skill-toolset.sh resource ci-cd-and-automation references/ci-pipeline.yml`

### With Database Integration Tests

Load the extended pipeline with DB services (L3):
`bash ./scripts/skill-toolset.sh resource ci-cd-and-automation references/ci-database.yml`

### E2E Tests

Load the E2E test pipeline (L3):
`bash ./scripts/skill-toolset.sh resource ci-cd-and-automation references/ci-e2e.yml`

> **Note:** The database integration and E2E pipeline templates above are already available as L3 references.

## Feeding CI Failures Back to Agents

The power of CI with AI agents is the feedback loop. When CI fails:

```
CI fails
    │
    ▼
Copy the failure output
    │
    ▼
Feed it to the agent:
"The CI pipeline failed with this error:
[paste specific error]
Fix the issue and verify locally before pushing again."
    │
    ▼
Agent fixes -> pushes -> CI runs again
```

**Key patterns:**

```
Lint failure -> Agent runs `npm run lint --fix` and commits
Type error  -> Agent reads the error location and fixes the type
Test failure -> Agent follows debugging-and-error-recovery skill
Build error -> Agent checks config and dependencies
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Preview Deployments

Load preview deployment config (L3):
`bash ./scripts/skill-toolset.sh resource ci-cd-and-automation references/preview-deploy.yml`

### Feature Flags

Feature flags decouple deployment from release. Deploy incomplete or risky features behind flags so you can:

- **Ship code without enabling it.** Merge to main early, enable when ready.
- **Roll back without redeploying.** Disable the flag instead of reverting code.
- **Canary new features.** Enable for 1% of users, then 10%, then 100%.
- **Run A/B tests.** Compare behavior with and without the feature.

```typescript
// Simple feature flag pattern
if (featureFlags.isEnabled('new-checkout-flow', { userId })) {
  return renderNewCheckout();
}
return renderLegacyCheckout();
```

**Flag lifecycle:** Create -> Enable for testing -> Canary -> Full rollout -> Remove the flag and dead code. Flags that live forever become technical debt --- set a cleanup date when you create them.

### Staged Rollouts

```
PR merged to main
    │
    ▼
  Staging deployment (auto)
    │ Manual verification
    ▼
  Production deployment (manual trigger or auto after staging)
    │
    ▼
  Monitor for errors (15-minute window)
    │
    ├── Errors detected -> Rollback
    └── Clean -> Done
```

### Rollback Plan

Load rollback workflow (L3):
`bash ./scripts/skill-toolset.sh resource ci-cd-and-automation references/rollback.yml`

## Environment Management

```
.env.example       -> Committed (template for developers)
.env                -> NOT committed (local development)
.env.test           -> Committed (test environment, no real secrets)
CI secrets          -> Stored in GitHub Secrets / vault
Production secrets  -> Stored in deployment platform / vault
```

CI should never have production secrets. Use separate secrets for CI testing.

## Automation Beyond CI

### Dependabot / Renovate

Load Dependabot config (L3):
`bash ./scripts/skill-toolset.sh resource ci-cd-and-automation references/dependabot.yml`

### Build Cop Role

Designate someone responsible for keeping CI green. When the build breaks, the Build Cop's job is to fix or revert --- not the person whose change caused the break. This prevents broken builds from accumulating while everyone assumes someone else will fix it.

### PR Checks

- **Required reviews:** At least 1 approval before merge
- **Required status checks:** CI must pass before merge
- **Branch protection:** No force-pushes to main
- **Auto-merge:** If all checks pass and approved, merge automatically

## CI Optimization

When the pipeline exceeds 10 minutes, apply these strategies in order of impact:

```
Slow CI pipeline?
├── Cache dependencies
│   └── Use actions/cache or setup-node cache option for node_modules
├── Run jobs in parallel
│   └── Split lint, typecheck, test, build into separate parallel jobs
├── Only run what changed
│   └── Use path filters to skip unrelated jobs (e.g., skip e2e for docs-only PRs)
├── Use matrix builds
│   └── Shard test suites across multiple runners
├── Optimize the test suite
│   └── Remove slow tests from the critical path, run them on a schedule instead
└── Use larger runners
    └── GitHub-hosted larger runners or self-hosted for CPU-heavy builds
```

**Example: caching and parallelism**

Load the parallel CI jobs example (L3):
`bash ./scripts/skill-toolset.sh resource ci-cd-and-automation references/ci-parallel.yml`

## Presentation

```
`★ CI/CD View ────────────────────────────────────`
- [Pipeline name] --- [status]
- [Top finding or recommendation]
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "CI is too slow" | Optimize the pipeline (see CI Optimization below), don't skip it. A 5-minute pipeline prevents hours of debugging. |
| "This change is trivial, skip CI" | Trivial changes break builds. CI is fast for trivial changes anyway. |
| "The test is flaky, just re-run" | Flaky tests mask real bugs and waste everyone's time. Fix the flakiness. |
| "We'll add CI later" | Projects without CI accumulate broken states. Set it up on day one. |
| "Manual testing is enough" | Manual testing doesn't scale and isn't repeatable. Automate what you can. |

## Red Flags

- No CI pipeline in the project
- CI failures ignored or silenced
- Tests disabled in CI to make the pipeline pass
- Production deploys without staging verification
- No rollback mechanism
- Secrets stored in code or CI config files (not secrets manager)
- Long CI times with no optimization effort

## Verification

After setting up or modifying CI:

- [ ] All quality gates are present (lint, types, tests, build, audit)
- [ ] Pipeline runs on every PR and push to main
- [ ] Failures block merge (branch protection configured)
- [ ] CI results feed back into the development loop
- [ ] Secrets are stored in the secrets manager, not in code
- [ ] Deployment has a rollback mechanism
- [ ] Pipeline runs in under 10 minutes for the test suite
