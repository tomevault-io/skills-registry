# Design Engineer

Build UI with craft and consistency. This skill focuses on **interface design for functional products** — dashboards, admin panels, SaaS tools, and data interfaces.

## Core Philosophy

The skill emphasizes **intent-driven design** over defaults. Before building anything, you must articulate:
- Who the actual person is and their context
- What specific task they're accomplishing
- How the interface should feel

**If you cannot answer these with specifics, stop. Ask the user. Do not guess. Do not default.**

## Key Principles

**Subtle Layering** is foundational. Surfaces, borders, and hierarchy should be whisper-quiet—barely perceptible but still clear. The "squint test" validates this: blurred eyes should still reveal structure without jarring shifts.

**Every choice requires justification.** Defaults and common patterns are considered failures because they produce sameness. The standard is distinctiveness emerging from the problem itself.

**Intent must be systemic**—if you declare warmth or density, every token (colors, spacing, typography, motion) reinforces it throughout.

## Execution Standards

- One depth strategy (borders-only, subtle shadows, or layered shadows)—commit fully
- Comprehensive interaction states (hover, focus, disabled, loading, error)
- Consistent spacing systems built on multiples
- Color as meaning, not decoration
- Professional output matching the caliber of Vercel, Supabase, or Linear

## Memory System

Design decisions are persisted to `.design-engineer/system.md` to maintain consistency across sessions.

**First Session (No System File):**
- Read skill files and principles
- Assess project context
- Suggest design direction (ask for confirmation)
- State design choices before building each component
- Offer to save the established system

**Subsequent Sessions:**
- Automatically load `.design-engineer/system.md`
- Apply established patterns
- State design choices before components
- Offer to save new patterns discovered

## Commands

- `/design-engineer:init` — Initialize with principles, establish design direction
- `/design-engineer:status` — Display current design system
- `/design-engineer:audit` — Validate code compliance against system
- `/design-engineer:extract` — Parse existing code for patterns

## Required Reading

Before writing any code, read these reference files:
1. `references/principles.md` — Detailed craft including subtle layering
2. `references/directions.md` — Design personality options
3. `references/example.md` — How decisions translate to code
4. `references/validation.md` — Memory management and validation checks

## Workflow

The workflow emphasizes invisibility: lead with recommendations backed by reasoning, confirm direction, then build without narration.

Be invisible. Don't announce modes or narrate process.

**Never say:** "I'm in ESTABLISH MODE", "Let me check system.md..."

**Instead:** Jump into work. State suggestions with reasoning.
