# Check Constitutional Alignment

## Purpose

The defining-constitution exists to prevent:
- Scope creep from "interesting but misaligned" features
- Violations of core design values
- Decisions that contradict established principles
- Accumulation of inconsistent patterns

This skill provides systematic, documented evaluation using the project's own decision framework.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill:
- **Before creating specifications** for new features
- **During feature discussions** when user proposes new work
- **When reviewing PRs** that introduce significant changes
- **Before roadmap updates** that add new phases/features
- **When uncertain** whether something fits the project

## Evaluation Process

### Phase 1: Read the Constitution

**Load constitutional principles:**

```bash
cat .wrangler/CONSTITUTION.md
```

**Extract key information:**

1. **North Star Mission**: What is the core purpose?
2. **Core Principles**: List all principles (typically 3-7)
3. **Decision Framework**: What questions must be answered?
4. **Anti-patterns**: What explicitly should NOT be done?

**Store mentally** for application in next phases.

### Phase 2: Understand the Proposal

**Gather complete picture of proposed feature:**

**Ask clarifying questions if needed:**
- "What problem does this solve for users?"
- "Who benefits from this feature?"
- "What's the simplest version of this that provides value?"
- "Are there existing features that already solve this?"
- "What would happen if we didn't build this?"

**Document proposal clearly:**

```markdown
## Proposal Summary

**Feature**: [Name/title]

**Description**: [What it does in 2-3 sentences]

**User Value**: [Problem it solves]

**Scope**: [What's included/excluded]

**Alternatives Considered**: [Other approaches, if any]
```

### Phase 3: Apply Decision Framework

**The defining-constitution has a decision framework (5 standard questions).**

**For EACH question, provide detailed analysis:**

#### Question 1: Constitutional Alignment

"Does this align with our core principles?"

**Process:**
1. List each principle from defining-constitution
2. For each principle, analyze alignment:
   - ✅ **Aligns**: How this feature supports the principle
   - ❌ **Conflicts**: How this feature violates the principle
   - ⚠️ **Neutral**: Principle doesn't apply to this feature

**Example analysis:**

```markdown
### Principle 1: Simplicity Over Features

**Assessment**: ❌ **Conflicts**

**Reasoning**: This feature adds 12 new configuration options, violating the principle "Prefer convention over configuration." The defining-constitution explicitly lists "configuration for every possible option" as an anti-pattern.

**Relevant Quote**: "Delete code before adding configuration options" - This adds configuration instead of removing it.
```

```markdown
### Principle 2: Privacy by Default

**Assessment**: ✅ **Aligns**

**Reasoning**: Feature requires explicit user consent before data collection, following the "opt-in, not opt-out" principle. Aligns with anti-pattern "Collecting data without clear user benefit."

**Relevant Quote**: "Users MUST explicitly enable telemetry" - This feature follows that pattern.
```

**Repeat for all principles.**

#### Question 2: User Value

"Does this solve a real user problem?"

**Criteria:**
- Evidence of user pain (GitHub issues, support tickets, user feedback)
- Clear user benefit (what gets better/faster/easier)
- NOT just "nice to have" or "might be useful someday"

**Analysis template:**

```markdown
### User Value Assessment

**Problem Statement**: [What user problem exists?]

**Evidence**:
- [GitHub issue #X]: 10 users requested this
- [Support tickets]: 5 tickets per week about this pain point
- [User research]: 70% of users struggle with [problem]

**Benefit**:
- Users can now [action] in [time/effort savings]
- Eliminates [pain point]
- Improves [metric] by [amount]

**Score**: ✅ Strong user value / ⚠️ Speculative value / ❌ No clear value
```

#### Question 3: Simplicity

"Is this the simplest solution that works?"

**Criteria:**
- Can it be simpler and still solve the problem?
- Does it add essential complexity or accidental complexity?
- Could we solve this with existing features + docs?
- Is there a "boring" solution we're overlooking?

**Analysis template:**

```markdown
### Simplicity Assessment

**Proposed Complexity**:
- [N] new API endpoints
- [N] new database tables
- [N] new configuration options
- [N] new dependencies

**Simpler Alternatives Considered**:
1. **[Alternative 1]**: [Why rejected or why this is already the simple version]
2. **[Alternative 2]**: [Why rejected]

**Justification for Complexity**:
[Explain why this complexity is essential, not accidental]

**Score**: ✅ Simplest solution / ⚠️ Could be simpler / ❌ Unnecessarily complex
```

#### Question 4: Maintainability

"Can we maintain this long-term?"

**Criteria:**
- Do we have expertise to maintain this?
- Will this require ongoing updates (e.g., new browser features, API changes)?
- Does this create tech debt?
- How does this affect test surface area?

**Analysis template:**

```markdown
### Maintainability Assessment

**Ongoing Maintenance**:
- Requires expertise in: [technologies/domains]
- Expected update frequency: [how often needs changes]
- Dependencies that might break: [external APIs, libraries]
- Test coverage required: [unit/integration/e2e]

**Team Capacity**:
- Current expertise: [✅ Have it / ⚠️ Can learn / ❌ Don't have it]
- Time to maintain: [hours/week estimated]

**Tech Debt Created**:
- [Acceptable/concerning debt description]

**Score**: ✅ Maintainable / ⚠️ Requires investment / ❌ Unsustainable
```

#### Question 5: Scope

"Does this fit our mission, or is it scope creep?"

**Criteria:**
- Does this align with North Star mission?
- Is this core to the product or peripheral?
- Would users still want our product if we removed this?
- Is this something users expect from us, or would they be surprised?

**Analysis template:**

```markdown
### Scope Assessment

**Mission Alignment**:
[North Star mission from defining-constitution]

**This Feature**:
- Core to mission: [Yes/No - explain why]
- User expectation: [Expected/Surprising/Delightful]
- Without this feature: [Product still viable? Yes/No]

**Scope Classification**:
- ✅ **Core**: Essential to product value proposition
- ⚠️ **Complementary**: Enhances core but not essential
- ❌ **Scope Creep**: Interesting but misaligned

**Score**: [Classification from above]
```

### Phase 4: Check Anti-Patterns

**Constitution lists explicit anti-patterns.**

**For each anti-pattern, check if proposal violates it:**

```markdown
## Anti-Pattern Check

### Anti-Pattern 1: "[Quote from defining-constitution]"

**Violation**: ✅ Yes / ❌ No

**Evidence**: [If yes, explain how proposal violates this anti-pattern]

### Anti-Pattern 2: "[Quote from defining-constitution]"

**Violation**: ✅ Yes / ❌ No

**Evidence**: [If yes, explain how]
```

**ANY anti-pattern violation = automatic ❌**

### Phase 5: Review Good/Bad Examples

**Constitution includes examples of good and bad compliance.**

**Compare proposal to examples:**

```markdown
## Example Comparison

### Similar to Good Example: "[Quote good example from defining-constitution]"

**Similarity**: [How proposal resembles this good example]

### Different from Bad Example: "[Quote bad example from defining-constitution]"

**Difference**: [How proposal avoids this bad pattern]

**OR**

### Concerning Similarity to Bad Example: "[Quote bad example]"

**Similarity**: [How proposal resembles this bad pattern - red flag]
```

### Phase 6: Generate Recommendation

**Based on all analysis, provide one of three recommendations:**

#### ✅ APPROVE: Proposal Aligns

**Criteria for approval:**
- ALL 5 decision framework questions = ✅ or mostly ✅
- NO anti-pattern violations
- Aligns with most/all principles
- Resembles good examples from defining-constitution

**Output:**

```markdown
# Constitutional Alignment: ✅ APPROVED

## Summary

This proposal aligns with project constitutional principles and passes all decision framework criteria.

## Key Alignments

2. Include this alignment analysis in Constitutional Alignment section
3. Proceed to implementation planning
```

#### ⚠️ REVISE: Proposal Needs Modification

**Criteria for revision:**
- SOME questions = ⚠️ or ❌ but fixable
- Aligns with core principles but has concerning aspects
- No anti-pattern violations, but close to edge

**Output:**

```markdown
