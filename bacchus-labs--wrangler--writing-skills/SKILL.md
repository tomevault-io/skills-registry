# Writing Skills

## Overview

**Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation.**

**Personal skills live in agent-specific directories (`~/.claude/skills` for Claude Code, `~/.codex/skills` for Codex)** 

You write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail (baseline behavior), write the skill (documentation), watch tests pass (agents comply), and refactor (close loopholes).

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you don't know if the skill teaches the right thing.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand wrangler:practicing-tdd before using this skill. That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill adapts TDD to documentation.

**Official guidance:** For Anthropic's official skill authoring resources, see references/anthropic-resources.md for links to live documentation maintained by Anthropic.

## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools.

**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides
**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about specific problem-solving sessions

## TDD Mapping for Skills

| TDD Concept | Skill Creation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Test case** | Pressure scenario with subagent |
| **Production code** | Skill document (SKILL.md) |
| **Test fails (RED)** | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline) |
| **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present |
| **Refactor** | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance |
| **Write test first** | Run baseline scenario BEFORE writing skill |
| **Watch it fail** | Document exact rationalizations agent uses |
| **Minimal code** | Write skill addressing those specific violations |
| **Watch it pass** | Verify agent now complies |
| **Refactor cycle** | Find new rationalizations → plug → re-verify |

The entire skill creation process follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.

## When to Create a Skill

**Create when:** Not intuitively obvious, reusable across projects, broadly applicable
**Don't create for:** One-offs, standard practices, project-specific (use CLAUDE.md)

**Skill types:** Technique (concrete steps), Pattern (mental model), Reference (API docs)

## Directory Structure

```
skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: Main skill content
├── templates/            # Optional: Template files for the skill
├── scripts/              # Optional: Executable scripts
├── references/           # Optional: Heavy reference material (100+ lines)
└── assets/               # Optional: Diagrams, config files, images
```

**Key principles:**
- Flat namespace (no nested skill directories)
- Keep principles and small code patterns (<50 lines) inline in SKILL.md
- Use subdirectories only when content is too large for inline inclusion
- Reference files should be loaded progressively, not automatically

## SKILL.md Structure

**Frontmatter:** `name` (letters, numbers, hyphens) and `description` (third-person, "Use when..." triggers). Max 1024 chars.

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Use when [triggers] - [what it does]
---
# Skill Name
## Overview
Core principle in 1-2 sentences.
## When to Use
Symptoms and use cases
## Quick Reference
Table for common operations
## Implementation
Inline code or link to file
## Common Mistakes
What goes wrong + fixes
```

## Claude Search Optimization (CSO)

### 1. Rich Description Field

Start with "Use when..." for triggering conditions. Use concrete triggers/symptoms, describe problems not language-specific details, third person.

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Too abstract
description: For async testing

# ✅ GOOD: Concrete trigger + what it does
description: Use when tests have race conditions, timing dependencies, or pass/fail inconsistently - replaces arbitrary timeouts with condition polling for reliable async tests
```

### 2. Keyword Coverage

Use words Claude would search for:
- Error messages: "Hook timed out", "ENOTEMPTY", "race condition"
- Symptoms: "flaky", "hanging", "zombie", "pollution"
- Synonyms: "timeout/hang/freeze", "cleanup/teardown/afterEach"
- Tools: Actual commands, library names, file types

### 3. Descriptive Naming

Verb-first (creating-skills not skill-creation). Name by what you DO or core insight. Gerunds work well for processes.

### 4. Token Efficiency

Target: getting-started <150 words, frequently-loaded <200 words, others <500 words. Move details to tool help, use cross-references, compress examples, eliminate redundancy.

### 5. Cross-Referencing

Use skill name with explicit requirement markers: "REQUIRED: Use wrangler:practicing-tdd". Don't use @ links (force-loads context).

## Flowchart Usage

Use ONLY for: Non-obvious decision points, process loops, "A vs B" decisions.

Never for: Reference material (tables), code examples (markdown), linear instructions (lists).

See assets/graphviz-conventions.dot for style rules.

## Code Examples

One excellent example beats many mediocre ones. Choose relevant language, make it complete and runnable, comment WHY not what. Single language only.

## File Organization

Choose your organization strategy based on skill complexity and token efficiency:

### Self-Contained (Recommended Default)
**When:** Simple skills, <200 lines, no heavy reference material
**Structure:** Everything in SKILL.md
**Benefits:** Single file, fastest discovery

### Progressive Disclosure
**When:** Skills >300 lines, complex workflows, heavy reference docs
**Structure:** SKILL.md + references/ or templates/
**Benefits:** Frequently-needed content in SKILL.md, defer rarely-needed details

### With Executable Tools
**When:** Skill provides reusable code/scripts
**Structure:** SKILL.md + scripts/ or templates/
**Benefits:** Code can be directly used

### Decision Criteria

**Stay self-contained when**:
- Total content <200 lines
- All content is frequently needed
- No distinct "reference" vs "guidance" split

**Use progressive disclosure when**:
- SKILL.md would exceed 300 lines
- Skill has multiple distinct aspects (e.g., overview + API reference + examples)
- Reference material is heavy but rarely needed (API docs, lookup tables)
- Some content is "getting started" vs "advanced usage"

**Token efficiency considerations**:
- Only frequently-loaded content "costs" tokens in practice
- SKILL.md loads when skill is invoked
- Additional files load only when explicitly referenced
- Heavy reference material (>100 lines) should be in references/
- Templates should be in templates/, not inline

**Reference**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills for progressive disclosure patterns

## The Iron Law

```
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Applies to NEW skills AND EDITS.

Write skill before testing? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:** Not for "simple additions", "just adding a section", or "documentation updates". Don't keep untested changes as "reference". Delete means delete.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** wrangler:practicing-tdd skill.

## Testing All Skill Types

Different skill types need different test approaches:

**Discipline Skills** (TDD, verification): Test with pressure scenarios combining time + sunk cost + exhaustion. Success = agent follows rule under maximum pressure.

**Technique Skills** (condition-based-waiting, tracing-root-causes): Test with application scenarios and variations. Success = agent applies technique correctly to new scenario.

**Pattern Skills** (reducing-complexity): Test with recognition and counter-examples. Success = agent knows when/how to apply pattern.

**Reference Skills** (API docs): Test retrieval and application. Success = agent finds and uses information correctly.

## Common Rationalizations for Skipping Testing

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Skill is obviously clear" | Clear to you ≠ clear to other agents. Test it. |
| "It's just a reference" | References can have gaps, unclear sections. Test retrieval. |
| "Testing is overkill" | Untested skills have issues. Always. 15 min testing saves hours. |
| "I'll test if problems emerge" | Problems = agents can't use skill. Test BEFORE deploying. |
| "Too tedious to test" | Testing is less tedious than debugging bad skill in production. |
| "I'm confident it's good" | Overconfidence guarantees issues. Test anyway. |
| "Academic review is enough" | Reading ≠ using. Test application scenarios. |
| "No time to test" | Deploying untested skill wastes more time fixing it later. |

**All of these mean: Test before deploying. No exceptions.**

## Bulletproofing Skills Against Rationalization

Skills that enforce discipline (like TDD) need to resist rationalization. Agents are smart and will find loopholes when under pressure.

**Psychology note:** Understanding WHY persuasion techniques work helps you apply them systematically. See references/persuasion-principles.md for research foundation (Cialdini, 2021; Meincke et al., 2025) on authority, commitment, scarcity, social proof, and unity principles.

### Close Every Loophole Explicitly

Don't just state rules - forbid specific workarounds. Add "No exceptions: Don't keep as 'reference', don't adapt, delete means delete."

Add foundational principle early: "Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules."

### Build Rationalization Table

Capture rationalizations from baseline testing (see Testing section below). Every excuse agents make goes in the table:

```markdown
| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |
| "Tests after achieve same goals" | Tests-after = "what does this do?" Tests-first = "what should this do?" |
```

### Create Red Flags List

Make it easy for agents to self-check when rationalizing:

```markdown
## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- "I already manually tested it"
- "Tests after achieve the same purpose"
- "It's about spirit not ritual"
- "This is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**
```

### Update CSO for Violation Symptoms

Add to description: symptoms of when you're ABOUT to violate the rule:

```yaml
description: use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code
```

## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for Skills

Follow the TDD cycle:

### RED: Write Failing Test (Baseline)

Run pressure scenario with subagent WITHOUT the skill. Document exact behavior:
- What choices did they make?
- What rationalizations did they use (verbatim)?
- Which pressures triggered violations?

This is "watch the test fail" - you must see what agents naturally do before writing the skill.

### GREEN: Write Minimal Skill

Write skill that addresses those specific rationalizations. Don't add extra content for hypothetical cases.

Run same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply.

### REFACTOR: Close Loopholes

Agent found new rationalization? Add explicit counter. Re-test until bulletproof.

**Testing details below** - see Testing Skills section for complete methodology:
- How to write pressure scenarios
- Pressure types (time, sunk cost, authority, exhaustion)
- Plugging holes systematically
- Meta-testing techniques

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Narrative Example
"In session 2025-10-03, we found empty projectDir caused..."
**Why bad:** Too specific, not reusable

### ❌ Multi-Language Dilution
example-js.js, example-py.py, example-go.go
**Why bad:** Mediocre quality, maintenance burden

### ❌ Code in Flowcharts
```dot
step1 [label="import fs"];
step2 [label="read file"];
```
**Why bad:** Can't copy-paste, hard to read

### ❌ Generic Labels
helper1, helper2, step3, pattern4
**Why bad:** Labels should have semantic meaning

## STOP: Before Moving to Next Skill

After writing ANY skill, STOP and complete the deployment process.

**Do NOT:**
- Batch create skills without testing each
- Move to next skill before verification
- Skip testing for "efficiency"

Deployment checklist below is MANDATORY for EACH skill.

## Skill Creation Checklist (TDD Adapted)

**RED:** Create pressure scenarios (3+ pressures) → Run WITHOUT skill → Document rationalizations → Identify patterns

**GREEN:** Name (letters/numbers/hyphens) → Frontmatter (name + "Use when..." description, max 1024 chars) → Clear overview → Address RED failures → Code inline or link → One excellent example → Run WITH skill, verify compliance

**REFACTOR:** Identify NEW rationalizations → Add explicit counters → Build rationalization table → Create red flags → Re-test until bulletproof

**Quality:** Flowchart if non-obvious, quick reference table, common mistakes, no narrative, supporting files only for tools/heavy reference

**Deploy:** Commit to git, consider PR if broadly useful

## Discovery Workflow

Encounters problem → Finds skill (description matches) → Scans overview → Reads quick reference → Loads example if implementing. Put searchable terms early.

## Testing Skills

Create pressure scenarios (3+ combined pressures: time, sunk cost, authority) → Run WITHOUT skill → Document rationalizations → Write skill to counter those specific rationalizations → Re-test → Plug new holes → Repeat until bulletproof.

**Detailed methodology**: See `references/testing-methodology.md` for complete pressure scenario patterns, verification process, and bulletproofing techniques.

## The Bottom Line

Creating skills IS TDD for process documentation.

Same Iron Law: No skill without failing test first.
Same cycle: RED (baseline) → GREEN (write skill) → REFACTOR (close loopholes).

If you follow TDD for code, follow it for skills.
