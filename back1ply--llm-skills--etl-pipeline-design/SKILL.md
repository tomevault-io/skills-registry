# ETL Pipeline Design Skill

> **Source**: Distilled from *Understanding ETL (Updated Edition)* by Matt Palmer, O'Reilly Media, August 2025. ISBN: 979-8-341-66508-8

Applicable when designing data ingestion from APIs, databases, or streaming sources; building transformation pipelines (batch or streaming); selecting orchestration tools or patterns; troubleshooting pipeline failures or data quality issues; or optimizing pipelines for efficiency and scale.

---

## Core Concepts

### ETL vs ELT

- **ETL**: Transform data before loading (legacy, when storage was expensive)
- **ELT**: Load all data first, transform downstream (modern approach — "storage is cheap")
- Modern pipelines are typically ELT, but the term "ETL" persists

### Medallion Architecture

Stage data in three quality layers:

| Layer | Purpose | Example |
| ------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Bronze** | Raw, unfiltered data directly from sources | API responses, raw logs |
| **Silver** | Cleaned, filtered, enriched | Removed duplicates, renamed columns |
| **Gold** | Stakeholder-ready, often aggregated | Reporting tables, ML features |

---

## 1. Data Ingestion

### Source Evaluation Checklist

For every data source, answer:

| Question | Why It Matters |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Who will use this data? | Aligns incentives, prioritizes work |
| How will it be used? | Guides downstream decisions |
| Is it bounded or unbounded? | Determines batch vs. streaming |
| What's the minimum update frequency? | Sets hard limits on freshness |
| What's the expected volume? | Informs storage/compute choices |
| What's the format? (JSON, CSV, API, DB) | Dictates processing requirements |
| What's the quality? | Determines transformation needs |

### Destination Considerations

- **OLAP** (BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, Databricks SQL): For analytics, column-oriented
- **OLTP** (Postgres, MySQL): For transactional apps, row-oriented
- **Lakehouse** (Delta Lake, Iceberg, Hudi): Combines lake + warehouse benefits

### Batch vs. Streaming Decision

```text
Is the data bounded (finite)?
├── YES → Batch processing
└── NO (continuous/unbounded) →
    ├── Latency requirement < 1 second? → True streaming (Flink, Kafka Streams)
    └── Latency 100ms-minutes acceptable? → Micro-batch (Spark Structured Streaming)
```

**Streaming Methods**:

- **Fixed windows**: Data batched in fixed time intervals
- **Sliding windows**: Overlapping time intervals
- **Sessions**: Dynamic windows based on activity gaps

### Choosing Ingestion Solutions

| Type | Examples | Pros | Cons |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Legacy declarative** | Talend, Pentaho | Robust connectors | Outdated, not MDS-aligned |
| **Modern declarative** | Fivetran, Airbyte, Stitch | Low maintenance, connectors | Vendor lock-in, cost |
| **Native/Platform** | Lakeflow Connect, Glue | Integrated, managed | Platform-specific |
| **Imperative** | Custom scripts, Singer taps | Full control | High build/maintain cost |
| **Hybrid** | Mix of above | Flexibility | Complexity |

**Recommendation**: Use declarative for common sources, imperative for edge cases.

## 2. Data Transformation

### Transformation Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example |
| --------- | ------------- | --------- |
| **Enrichment** | Add data from other sources | Join order codes → readable names |
| **Joining** | Combine datasets on common keys | Sales + Users → add country |
| **Filtering** | Select only needed records | `WHERE date >= '2025-01-01'` |
| **Structuring** | Convert formats | JSON → tabular Parquet |
| **Conversion** | Change data types | String → datetime |
| **Aggregation** | Summarize data | Daily totals from hourly data |
| **Anonymization** | Mask PII | Hash emails |
| **Splitting** | Break columns apart | email → prefix + domain |
| **Deduplication** | Remove duplicates | Keep earliest by UUID |

### Update Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | SQL Concept |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Overwrite** | Small datasets, simple refreshes | `TRUNCATE` + `INSERT` |
| **Insert** | Append-only data (logs, transactions) | `INSERT INTO` |
| **Upsert** | CDC, deduplication, SCD | `MERGE` |
| **Delete** | Soft (status='deleted') or hard (remove row) | `UPDATE` or `DELETE` |

### UPSERT Example (Databricks)

```sql
MERGE INTO people10m
USING people10mupdates
ON people10m.id = people10mupdates.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET
  firstName = people10mupdates.firstName,
  lastName = people10mupdates.lastName
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (id, firstName, lastName)
VALUES (people10mupdates.id, people10mupdates.firstName, people10mupdates.lastName)
```

### Best Practices

- **Staging**: Always stage intermediate data for recoverability
- **Idempotency**: Running a pipeline twice should produce the same result
- **Incrementality**: Process only new/changed data when possible

---

## 3. Data Orchestration

### What Orchestrators Do

- Manage dependencies between tasks (DAGs)
- Schedule and trigger pipelines
- Handle retries, errors, and alerts
- Provide monitoring and lineage

### Orchestrator Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Questions to Ask |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| **Scalability** | Can it handle 10x DAGs/tasks? |
| **Reusability** | Can I create reusable components? |
| **Connections** | Native integrations with my stack? |
| **Support** | Active community or paid support? |
| **Observability** | Can I see failures, lineage, logs? |

### Orchestrator Options

| Tool | Type | Best For |
| ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| **Airflow** | Open source | Mature, widely adopted, many connectors |
| **Dagster** | Open source | Modern, asset-based, good DX |
| **Prefect** | Open source | Python-native, flexible |
| **Lakeflow Jobs** | Platform | Databricks-native, integrated |
| **dbt** | SQL orchestrator | Warehouse transformations |

### Design Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
| --------- | ------------- |
| **Backfills** | Build pipelines that can recreate historical data |
| **Event-driven** | Trigger on data arrival, not just schedules |
| **Conditional logic** | Branch based on conditions (if/else) |
| **Concurrency** | Fan out parallel tasks for performance |
| **Parameterized** | Accept variables for flexibility |
| **Decomposition** | Break into micro-DAGs for isolation |

---

## 4. Troubleshooting & Observability

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| **Freshness** | Time since last update |
| **Volume** | Row counts, data sizes |
| **Quality** | Uniqueness, completeness, validity |

### Observability Methods

| Method | Purpose |
| -------- | --------- |
| **Logging** | Capture execution details |
| **Lineage** | Track data flow (column-level ideal) |
| **Anomaly detection** | Catch unexpected data patterns |
| **Data diffs** | See what code changes affect data |
| **Assertions** | Validate constraints (`price > 0`) |

### Error Handling

| Technique | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| **Retry logic** | Automatic retries with backoff |
| **Conditional handling** | Different paths for different errors |
| **Pipeline decomposition** | Isolate failures |
| **Graceful degradation** | Partial functionality on failure |
| **Alerting** | Notify team (avoid alert fatigue) |

### Incident Metrics

- **N**: Number of incidents
- **TTD**: Time to detection
- **TTR**: Time to resolution
- **Downtime**: N × (TTD + TTR)

---

## 5. Efficiency & Scalability

### Resource Allocation

| Concept | Description |
| --------- | ------------- |
| **Spot instances** | Cheaper but interruptible |
| **On-demand** | Reliable but costly |
| **Pooling** | Pre-warm clusters for faster starts |
| **Autoscaling** | Adjust resources to workload |
| **Serverless** | Pay per use (BigQuery, Databricks SQL) |

### Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Benefit |
| ----------- | --------- |
| **Incremental processing** | Only process new/changed data |
| **Columnar storage** | Faster analytics (Parquet, Delta) |
| **Partitioning** | Reduce data scanned |
| **Materialization** | Tables vs. views trade-offs |

### Scaling Formula

```text
Horizontal scaling = More machines/nodes
Vertical scaling = Bigger machines/nodes
```

## Decision Framework

When designing a pipeline:

1. **Understand the source** → Use source evaluation checklist
2. **Determine frequency** → Batch vs. streaming based on bounds + requirements
3. **Choose ingestion** → Declarative for common, imperative for custom
4. **Design transformations** → Apply appropriate patterns
5. **Plan updates** → Overwrite, insert, or upsert based on use case
6. **Orchestrate** → Select tool, apply design patterns
7. **Observe** → Implement logging, lineage, assertions
8. **Optimize** → Incrementality, partitioning, right-sizing resources

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Mixing orchestration with transformation | Orchestrator should trigger, not execute |
| No staging layer | Hard to recover from failures |
| Non-idempotent pipelines | Reruns cause duplicates or errors |
| Ignoring lineage | Impossible to debug data issues |
| Alert fatigue | Too many alerts = ignored alerts |
| GUI-only tooling | No version control, hard to collaborate |
