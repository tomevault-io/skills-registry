# Sync to Shared Knowledge Base

Transfer content from your personal notes to a shared team knowledge base.

---

## Configuration

Read `~/.claude/settings.json` and extract:
- `env.PERSONAL_VAULT` → source vault (personal)
- `env.COMPANY_VAULT` → target vault (company)

If either is not set, display: "Vaults not configured. Run /vault first."

**Source vault (personal):**
- Path from `env.PERSONAL_VAULT`
- Structure from `<personal_vault_path>/vault-config.yaml`

**Target vault (company):**
- Path from `env.COMPANY_VAULT`
- Structure from `<company_vault_path>/vault-config.yaml` (if exists)

**Author settings (user-specific):**
```yaml
author_name: "Henry"
author_wikilink: "[[Henry]]"  # Links to author's profile in KB
```

---

## Usage

```
/sync-company <description of content to transfer>
```

**Examples:**
```
/sync-company The idea about embedder agents parsing spec sheets with vision
/sync-company My thoughts on customer error classification from today's notes
/sync-company Transfer the agent verbosity notes to a dedicated note
```

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Read Target KB Style Guide

Read the style guide at the target KB root:
```
$COMPANY_VAULT/style-guide.md
```

Apply its formatting rules. Key conventions:
- Filenames: kebab-case
- Frontmatter: include `categories`, `created`, `author`
- Attribution in daily notes: `[{author_name}]` section notation
- Wikilinks for cross-references

### Step 2: Find Source Content

Based on the user's description, locate the content in the personal vault:

1. **Check today's daily note**: `$PERSONAL_VAULT/<daily_notes>/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (daily_notes from vault-config.yaml)
2. **Search recent daily notes** if not found today
3. **Check Notes/, Projects/, etc.** if referencing an existing note (paths from vault-config.yaml)

**If content cannot be found**: Ask the user to clarify or provide the content directly.

### Step 3: Strip Wikilinks

Before writing content to the company KB, convert all wikilinks from the personal vault to plain text. Personal vault links will be broken in the KB since those notes don't exist there.

**Conversion rules:**

| Pattern | Becomes |
|---------|---------|
| `[[Note Name]]` | `Note Name` |
| `[[long-name\|Display Text]]` | `Display Text` |
| `![[image.png]]` | *(remove — images don't transfer)* |
| `![[File.base]]` | *(remove — base views aren't content)* |
| `([[2026-03-20]])` | `(2026-03-20)` |

Apply these conversions to all wikilinks in the source content before proceeding to the next step.

### Step 4: Determine Destination Type

Decide where the content should go in the target KB:

| Content Type | Daily Note | Dedicated Note | Location |
|--------------|------------|----------------|----------|
| Quick thought/idea | Yes | No | Daily note only |
| Substantial idea/concept | Yes | Yes | `Notes/` |
| Project/tasks | Yes | Yes | `Projects/` |
| Reference/tool | Yes | Yes | `References/` |

**Guidelines:**
- Quick, informal thoughts → daily note only
- Substantial ideas worth referencing later → dedicated note + mention in daily
- User says "transfer to a note" or "dedicated note" → always create dedicated note

### Step 5: Locate or Create Daily Note

Check if today's daily note exists at:
1. `$COMPANY_VAULT/<daily_notes>/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (daily_notes from company vault-config.yaml if exists)
2. If folder doesn't exist, fall back to `$COMPANY_VAULT/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**If daily note doesn't exist**, create it:
```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes

[{author_name}]
```

**If it exists**, find or create the `[{author_name}]` section under `## Notes`.

### Step 6: Format and Write Content

#### Daily Note Entry

Append under the author's section:

```markdown
[{author_name}]
- <transferred content>
```

If a dedicated note was created, add a wikilink reference:
```markdown
- Added [[note-name]] - brief description
```

#### Dedicated Note (when applicable)

```markdown
---
categories:
  - "[[CategoryName]]"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
author: {author_name}
---

# Title

<transferred content>

---
See also: {author_wikilink}
```

### Step 7: Confirm

Report to user:
- What was transferred
- File path(s) written
- Wikilink to use for referencing: `[[note-name]]`

---

## Attribution Strategy

Attribution should be subtle and Obsidian-native:

| Location | Method | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Daily note | Section header | `[Henry]` |
| Frontmatter | Author field | `author: Henry` |
| Note footer | See also link | `See also: [[Henry]]` |

The `[[Henry]]` wikilink serves dual purpose:
- Indicates who contributed the note
- Links to the author's profile page in the KB
- Enables backlinks to find all notes by that person

---

## Example Workflows

### Quick Thought

**Input:** `/sync-company The embedder agent idea from today's notes`

→ Reads personal daily note, finds the embedder agent content
→ Appends to company daily note:
```markdown
[Henry]
- Embedder agent should support PDF and image inputs for spec sheet parsing
```

### Substantial Idea

**Input:** `/sync-company Transfer my customer error classification notes to a dedicated note`

→ Finds content in personal vault
→ Creates `Notes/customer-error-classification.md`:
```markdown
---
categories:
  - "[[Ideas]]"
created: 2026-01-20
author: Henry
---

# Customer Error Classification

<transferred content>

---
See also: [[Henry]]
```

→ Also appends to daily note:
```markdown
[Henry]
- Added [[customer-error-classification]] - approach for categorizing customer errors
```

---

### Wikilink Stripping

**Input (from personal vault):**
```markdown
The [[Embedder]] agent should use [[RAG Tools Comparison|RAG tools]] to parse
spec sheets. See [[Claude Code Best Practices]] for prompting patterns.
Related to the ([[2026-03-20]]) discussion with [[Henry]].
```

**Output (written to company KB):**
```markdown
The Embedder agent should use RAG tools to parse
spec sheets. See Claude Code Best Practices for prompting patterns.
Related to the (2026-03-20) discussion with Henry.
```

---

## Rules

1. **Always read the target KB's style guide first** - it defines the conventions
2. **Find source content first** - this is a transfer tool, not a creation tool
3. **Preserve original meaning** - clean up formatting, don't rewrite content
4. **Use wikilinks for attribution** - subtle, useful, enables backlinks
5. **Ask if unclear** - don't guess at ambiguous content or intent
