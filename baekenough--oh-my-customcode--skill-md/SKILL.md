# /omcustom:fsd — Full Self Driving

Autonomous release loop. Equivalent to running:

```
/goal "모든 이슈가 처리될 때까지" /loop "/pipeline auto-dev -> /homework"
```

This is a **thin alias / orchestrator skill**. It does not implement loop, issue-polling, release, or verification logic — it delegates entirely to existing skills.

## Usage

```
/omcustom:fsd               # Run until all auto-dev-eligible issues are exhausted
/omcustom:fsd 3             # Optional: cap at N releases (default: unlimited)
```

No arguments are required. The default behavior runs until the auto-dev-eligible issue set is empty.

## What It Does

FSD expands into:

1. **`/goal` wrapper** — applies disciplined goal-to-execution workflow:
   - Objective: "모든 이슈가 처리될 때까지"
   - Delegates planning, gap detection, and R020 completion verification to the `goal` skill
2. **`/loop` recurrence** — self-paced loop (model decides cadence), each iteration runs:
   1. `/pipeline auto-dev` — full release pipeline for the next eligible issue
   2. `/homework` — retrospective 찐빠 audit gate
   3. **Open PR processing** — merge or defer all open PRs before checking convergence

### Loop Convergence

The loop converges naturally when **both** conditions are met:

1. The auto-dev-eligible issue set reaches 0
2. All open PRs have been either merged or explicitly deferred

FSD processes **open PRs as part of each iteration**, not only issues. This includes dependabot PRs and any automatically created PRs. Issue eligibility follows `/pipeline auto-dev` label selection exactly:

- **Included**: `verify-ready` (preferred), unlabeled auto-dev candidates
- **Excluded**: `verify-done`, `needs-review`, `decision-needed` labels

Do NOT invent new label logic here — defer to the `pipeline` skill's auto-dev issue selection.

### PR Processing Rules

When open PRs are found during an iteration:

| PR state | Action |
|----------|--------|
| CI passing, auto-mergeable | Merge via mgr-gitnerd (R010) |
| CI failing with known pattern (e.g., dependabot frozen-lockfile cascade → `bun install` lockfile regeneration) | Fix CI, then merge |
| CI failing with unknown cause | Diagnose; if fixable within iteration, fix and merge; otherwise defer |
| Breaking change / design judgment required | Defer and surface to user |
| Explicitly excluded by user this session | Skip (honor directive persistence, R015) |

All PR merge operations are delegated to **mgr-gitnerd** (R010). After merging, verify ground-truth via `gh pr view` or `git log` before declaring done (R020).

Do NOT merge PRs that require user approval for architectural decisions. Surface them with a short summary and wait.

### Iteration Flow (per iteration)

```
[FSD Iteration N]
├── /pipeline auto-dev        → one release (PR create → merge → npm publish → milestone close)
├── /homework                 → extract 찐빠, confirm gate (or --dry-run if requested)
├── Open PR processing        → for each open PR: merge (if CI-green + auto-mergeable)
│                                                  fix-then-merge (known CI failure pattern)
│                                                  defer+surface (design decision needed)
└── Check convergence: eligible issues = 0 AND open PRs = 0 (merged or deferred)?
    ├── YES → [FSD Done] converged naturally
    └── NO  → next iteration
```

## Safety and Discipline

Each iteration operates under full project rules — no relaxation because FSD is autonomous:

| Rule | Applies |
|------|---------|
| R001 (safety) | Destructive ops still require explicit approval. Credential guardrails always active. PR merges that risk data loss require explicit approval. |
| R009 (parallel) | Independent subtasks within each pipeline iteration run in parallel. |
| R010 (orchestration) | All file modifications delegated to specialist subagents. mgr-gitnerd for git ops including PR merges. |
| R015 (intent persistence) | If user explicitly defers a specific PR this session, honor that deferral — do not retry it. |
| R017 (sync verification) | mgr-sauron passes required before any commit. |
| R020 (completion verification) | Each release verified via `npm view`, `gh release view`, closed issues before `[Done]`. PR merges verified via `gh pr view` ground-truth before declaring iteration complete. |

`/homework` runs as a **retrospective gate** between iterations — findings go through `omcustom-feedback`'s Phase 4A confirmation gate. The loop does NOT skip homework on the grounds that it is "automated". If homework requires user confirmation (e.g., to file a feedback issue), the loop pauses and waits.

If a release operation triggers the safety classifier, the current iteration stops and surfaces the block to the user before continuing.

## When to Use

| Scenario | Use FSD? |
|----------|----------|
| Multiple eligible issues ready to process autonomously | YES |
| Session where the user wants to "let it run" through the backlog | YES |
| Verifying the autonomous release loop pattern from session memory | YES |
| Single targeted issue fix | NO — use `/pipeline auto-dev` directly |
| Exploratory research / planning only | NO — use `/research` or `/deep-plan` |
| Only one issue and it needs human judgment | NO — use `/pipeline auto-dev` with manual oversight |

## When NOT to Use

- When issues require stakeholder approval or design decisions before implementation
- When the issue set includes `decision-needed` or `needs-review` items only (loop converges immediately — just use `/pipeline auto-dev` once)
- When cost sensitivity is high and the issue backlog is large — inspect the eligible set first before running FSD

## Optional Release Cap

Pass a numeric argument to cap at N releases:

```
/omcustom:fsd 3    # Process at most 3 issues this FSD run
```

This corresponds to the `-max` parameter used in the manual pattern. Default is unlimited (run until eligible issues exhausted). The cap is advisory — the pipeline itself may stop earlier if the eligible set runs out before the cap is reached.

## Session 114 Precedent

This skill was extracted from the manual pattern used in Session 114 (2026-06-09):

```
/goal "모든 이슈가 처리될 때까지" /loop "/pipeline auto-dev -> /homework"
```

That session ran 2 iterations (v0.177.0 and v0.178.0) before converging with 0 eligible issues remaining. FSD codifies this pattern as a first-class invocable command.

## Cross-References

| Skill / Rule | Role |
|--------------|------|
| `goal` | Disciplined goal-to-execution wrapper — objective parse, gap detection, R020 verification |
| `omcustom-loop` | Session auto-continuation via SubagentStop hook — keeps the loop alive during background agent work |
| `pipeline` | `/pipeline auto-dev` — the core release pipeline per iteration |
| `homework` | Retrospective 찐빠 audit gate per iteration |
| `mgr-gitnerd` | PR merge operations — all open PR merges delegated here (R010) |
| R001 (safety) | Destructive ops require approval; credential guardrails; risky PR merges require explicit approval |
| R009 (parallel execution) | Parallel subtasks within each pipeline iteration |
| R010 (orchestrator coordination) | All file writes delegated; mgr-gitnerd for git including PR merges |
| R015 (intent persistence) | User PR deferral decisions honored for the session |
| R017 (sync verification) | mgr-sauron required before commit/push |
| R020 (completion verification) | Actual outcome verified before declaring each release or PR merge done |

## Design Notes

This skill is intentionally a **thin alias**. It does NOT duplicate:
- Issue polling logic (owned by `pipeline`)
- Loop cadence / auto-continuation (owned by `omcustom-loop` + SubagentStop hook)
- Release pipeline steps (owned by `pipeline auto-dev`)
- Retrospective analysis (owned by `homework`)
- PR merge execution (owned by `mgr-gitnerd`)
- Completion verification (owned by R020 + `goal`)

If any of those underlying skills evolve, FSD automatically benefits — its only responsibility is declaring the intent and forwarding to the right components.

## Permission Mode Note

When this skill delegates work via Agent tool calls, ALL Agent tool calls MUST include `mode: "bypassPermissions"` per R010 Universal bypassPermissions.

## Artifact Output

Artifacts from each iteration follow the conventions of the constituent skills:
- Pipeline artifacts: `.claude/outputs/sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}/pipeline-auto-dev-{HHmmss}.md`
- Homework artifacts: `.claude/outputs/sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}/homework-{HHmmss}.md`
