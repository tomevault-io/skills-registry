- Finding bugs in existing code
- Code quality review
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Security vulnerability detection
- Refactoring recommendations
- Best practices enforcement

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Bug Detection
- Logic errors (off-by-one, null checks, etc.)
- Type mismatches and conversion issues
- Resource leaks (file handles, connections)
- Concurrency issues (race conditions, deadlocks)
- Exception handling gaps
- Edge case failures

### 2. Code Quality Issues
- Code duplication
- Overly complex functions
- Poor naming conventions
- Missing documentation
- Inconsistent formatting
- Dead code

### 3. Performance Problems
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) where O(n) possible)
- Unnecessary loops or operations
- Memory leaks
- Excessive I/O operations
- Missing caching opportunities
- Database query inefficiencies

### 4. Security Vulnerabilities
- SQL injection risks
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Insecure authentication
- Exposed secrets/credentials
- Insufficient input validation
- Path traversal risks

## Bug Hunting Workflow

### Phase 1: Code Understanding
```
1. Read all files to understand codebase structure
2. Identify entry points and main workflows
3. Map dependencies between components
4. Note external dependencies and APIs used
```

### Phase 2: Issue Detection
```
1. Static analysis (read code carefully)
2. Look for common bug patterns
3. Check error handling coverage
4. Validate input/output handling
5. Review edge cases
```

### Phase 3: Issue Documentation
```
For each issue found, document:
- Location: file:line_number
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Category: Bug / Performance / Security / Quality
- Description: What's wrong
- Impact: What could go wrong
- Recommendation: How to fix it
- Code example: Before and after
```

### Phase 4: Fix Implementation
```
1. Prioritize by severity
2. Implement fixes one at a time
3. Preserve existing functionality
4. Add comments explaining changes
5. Ensure backward compatibility (if needed)
```

## Bug Report Template

```markdown
## Bug Report

### Issue #N: [Brief Title]

**Location**: `file_path:line_number`
**Severity**: Critical | High | Medium | Low
**Category**: Bug | Performance | Security | Quality

**Description**:
[Clear explanation of what's wrong]

**Current Code**:
```python
# Problematic code here
```

**Issue**:
[Why this is a problem]

**Impact**:
- [What could go wrong]
- [Example failure scenario]

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
# Fixed code here
```

**Explanation**:
[Why this fix works]
```

## Common Bug Patterns

### 1. Null/None Check Missing
```python
# ❌ Bug
def process_user(user):
    return user.name.upper()  # Crashes if user is None

# ✅ Fix
def process_user(user):
    if user is None:
        return None
    return user.name.upper()
```

### 2. Off-by-One Error
```python
# ❌ Bug
for i in range(len(items) - 1):  # Misses last item!
    process(items[i])

# ✅ Fix
for i in range(len(items)):
    process(items[i])
# Or better:
for item in items:
    process(item)
```

### 3. Resource Leak
```python
# ❌ Bug
def read_file(path):
    f = open(path)
    data = f.read()
    return data  # File never closed!

# ✅ Fix
def read_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()
```

### 4. Mutable Default Argument
```python
# ❌ Bug
def append_to(element, target=[]):
    target.append(element)
    return target  # Shares same list across calls!

# ✅ Fix
def append_to(element, target=None):
    if target is None:
        target = []
    target.append(element)
    return target
```

### 5. Exception Swallowing
```python
# ❌ Bug
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except:
    pass  # Silent failure, no one knows what went wrong

# ✅ Fix
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except ValueError as e:
    logging.error(f"Failed to process: {e}")
    raise
```

### 6. SQL Injection
```python
# ❌ Bug
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{user_input}'"
cursor.execute(query)  # Vulnerable to injection!

# ✅ Fix
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
```

### 7. Inefficient Loop
```python
# ❌ Performance Issue
result = []
for item in large_list:
    if item not in result:  # O(n²) complexity!
        result.append(item)

# ✅ Fix
result = list(set(large_list))  # O(n)
# Or if order matters:
seen = set()
result = []
for item in large_list:
    if item not in seen:
        seen.add(item)
        result.append(item)
```

## Analysis Tools Available

When analyzing code, you have access to:
- `Read` - Read source files
- `Grep` - Search for patterns across codebase
- `Glob` - Find files by name/extension
- `Bash` - Run linters (pylint, flake8, mypy)

## Best Practices for Bug Fixing

### 1. Minimal Changes
- Fix one bug at a time
- Don't refactor while fixing bugs
- Preserve existing behavior (unless that's the bug)

### 2. Clear Documentation
```python
# Before: Bug - doesn't handle negative numbers
# After: Fixed - added validation for negative inputs
def calculate_square_root(num):
    if num < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate square root of negative number")
    return num ** 0.5
```

### 3. Add Defensive Checks
```python
def divide(a, b):
    """Divide a by b with safety checks"""
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both arguments must be numbers")
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b
```

### 4. Preserve Compatibility
```python
# When fixing a public API, maintain backward compatibility
def old_function(param1):
    """Deprecated: Use new_function instead"""
    warnings.warn("old_function is deprecated", DeprecationWarning)
    return new_function(param1)

def new_function(param1, param2=None):
    """New implementation with additional features"""
    # ... improved logic
```

## Output Format

├── file2.py          # Fixed version with comments
└── CHANGES.md        # Summary of all changes made
```

## Interactive Workflow

When working with users:

1. **Present Findings**: Show bug report with severity
2. **Wait for Approval**: Ask user which bugs to fix
3. **Implement Fixes**: Apply approved fixes only
4. **Document Changes**: Create CHANGES.md explaining what was fixed

## Example Task Breakdown

**Task**: "Find and fix bugs in this codebase"

**Step 1**: Analyze
- Read all Python files
- Identify potential issues
- Categorize by severity

**Step 2**: Report
- Generate bug report
- Prioritize issues
- Present to user

**Step 3**: Fix (after approval)
- Implement fixes for approved issues
- Test that fixes work
- Document changes

**Step 4**: Verify
- Review fixed code
- Ensure no new bugs introduced
- Provide summary

## Testing Recommendations

After fixing bugs, suggest:
```python
# Add tests for the bug fix
def test_divide_by_zero():
    """Ensure divide by zero raises ValueError"""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        divide(10, 0)

def test_divide_negative_numbers():
    """Ensure negative numbers work correctly"""
    assert divide(-10, 2) == -5.0
```

  python .claude/skills/code-analysis/scripts/performance_profiler.py {} \; \
  > perf.txt
```

### Phase 2: Manual Analysis (10-20 minutes)

1. **Read tool outputs** to understand detected issues
2. **Prioritize by severity**: Critical > High > Medium > Low
3. **Verify findings**: Some may be false positives
4. **Group related issues**: E.g., all SQL injections together

### Phase 3: Report Generation (15-30 minutes)

Create comprehensive bug report:
- Executive summary with counts
- Detailed findings with file:line references
- Code snippets (before/after)
- Remediation recommendations
- References to OWASP/CWE

### Phase 4: Fix Implementation (Variable time)

Implement fixes:
- One category at a time (e.g., all SQL injections)
- Add comments explaining each fix
- Don't introduce new bugs
- Preserve original functionality

### Phase 5: Verification (10-15 minutes)

Re-run tools to verify:
```bash
# Should show fewer issues
python .claude/skills/code-analysis/scripts/security_scanner.py .
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Combining Tools with Manual Analysis

```python
# Example workflow in agent code
import subprocess
import json

# Run static analyzer
result = subprocess.run([
    'python', '.claude/skills/code-analysis/scripts/static_analyzer.py',
    target_dir, '--format', 'json'
], capture_output=True, text=True)

issues = json.loads(result.stdout)

# Filter critical issues
critical = [i for i in issues if i['severity'] == 'critical']

# Generate detailed report for each
for issue in critical:
    # Read the problematic code
    with open(issue['file']) as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
        context = lines[issue['line']-3:issue['line']+2]

    # Add to bug report with context
    report.add_issue(issue, context)
```

### Custom Analysis Patterns

You can extend the tools by adding custom checkers. See [references/TOOLS_USAGE.md](references/TOOLS_USAGE.md) for examples.

### Integration with CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Security Scan
  run: |
    python .claude/skills/code-analysis/scripts/security_scanner.py . \
      --format json --output security.json

- name: Check Results
  run: |
    CRITICAL=$(jq '[.[] | select(.severity=="critical")] | length' security.json)
    if [ "$CRITICAL" -gt 0 ]; then
      echo "Found $CRITICAL critical issues"
      exit 1
    fi
```
