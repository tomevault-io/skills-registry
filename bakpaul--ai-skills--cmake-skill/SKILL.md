# CMake Expert Skill

Expert guidance on modern CMake (3.15+) focusing on practical implementation, debugging, and best practices.

## Core Principles

### Documentation-First Approach

**Always verify against CMake documentation when:**
- There is any uncertainty about behavior
- Previous advice didn't work as expected
- User reports unexpected behavior
- Dealing with version-specific features

Use web_search to check https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/

### Modern CMake Practices

- Use **target-based** approach (not directory-based variables)
- Prefer `target_*` commands over global variables
- Use IMPORTED targets from `find_package()` CONFIG mode
- Always specify visibility: `PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, `INTERFACE`

### Scope

**IN SCOPE:**
- Writing/debugging CMakeLists.txt
- Creating distributable libraries
- Understanding targets and dependencies
- Dependency management (find_package, FetchContent)
- Installation and export configurations
- Functions, macros, and scope management

**OUT OF SCOPE:**
- General C/C++ compilation errors (unless CMake-related)
- IDE-specific settings
- Non-CMake build systems

## Quick Reference

For common patterns and immediate lookup, use:
- **Creating libraries**: See `references/quick-reference.md`
- **Debugging**: See `references/debugging.md`
- **Complete examples**: See `references/examples.md`

### Most Common Patterns

**Basic library:**
```cmake
add_library(mylib SHARED src/mylib.cpp)
add_library(MyLib::mylib ALIAS mylib)

target_include_directories(mylib PUBLIC
    $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
    $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>
)
```

**Installation:**
```cmake
install(TARGETS mylib EXPORT MyLibTargets
    LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
    ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
    RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
    INCLUDES DESTINATION include
)

install(EXPORT MyLibTargets
    FILE MyLibTargets.cmake
    NAMESPACE MyLib::
    DESTINATION lib/cmake/MyLib
)
```

**Consumer usage:**
```cmake
find_package(MyLib REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE MyLib::mylib)
```

## Key Concepts

### Targets

A target represents a build artifact or logical grouping. Modern CMake is target-centric.

**Types:**
- **Executable**: Created with `add_executable()`
- **Library** (STATIC/SHARED/MODULE): Created with `add_library()`
- **INTERFACE**: Header-only or pure requirements
- **IMPORTED**: Pre-built libraries from `find_package()`
- **ALIAS**: Alternative name for existing target

**Why targets matter:**
- Enable transitive dependency propagation
- Encapsulate build requirements
- Provide clean interfaces
- Allow proper dependency resolution

For detailed target information, see `references/targets.md`.

### find_package

Searches for external dependencies in two modes:

**Module mode** (first): Looks for `Find<Package>.cmake` in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
**Config mode** (second): Looks for `<Package>Config.cmake` in install locations

**Common issues:**
- Package not found → Check CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
- Headers not found after find_package → Check target linking
- Wrong version → Use version requirements

For debugging find_package, see `references/debugging.md`.

### FetchContent

Downloads and integrates dependencies at configure time.

**When to use:**
- ✅ Dependencies not available as system packages
- ✅ Need specific version not installed
- ✅ Want reproducible builds

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ Large dependencies (>30s configure)
- ❌ Pre-installed packages preferred

For complete FetchContent guide, see `references/fetchcontent.md`.

### Functions and Macros

**Key difference:** Functions create new scope, macros don't.

**Use functions (default):**
- General purpose code
- Need encapsulation
- Want to return values

**Use macros (rare):**
- Control flow affecting caller
- Text manipulation
- Performance-critical code

For detailed scope management, see `references/functions-macros.md`.

### CTest - Running Tests

CTest is CMake's built-in testing tool for running and reporting test results.

**Basic usage:**
```cmake
# Enable testing
enable_testing()

# Add test executable
add_executable(my_test tests/test.cpp)

# Register test
add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND my_test)

# Set properties (optional)
set_tests_properties(MyTest PROPERTIES
    TIMEOUT 30
    LABELS "Unit"
)
```

**Running tests:**
```bash
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build                # Run all tests
ctest --test-dir build -j8           # Parallel execution
ctest --test-dir build -R TestName   # Run specific test
ctest --test-dir build -L Unit       # Run by label
```

**Key features:**
- Parallel test execution
- Test filtering and selection
- Timeout handling
- Integration with test frameworks (GTest, Catch2)
- Output validation

For complete CTest guide including fixtures, test properties, CI integration, and test frameworks, see `references/ctest.md`.

### CPack - Creating Installers

CPack creates distributable packages (installers, .deb, .rpm, .dmg, etc.) from your installed files.

**Basic usage:**
```cmake
# After project() and install() commands
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR "YourCompany")
set(CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/LICENSE.txt")
set(CPACK_GENERATOR "TGZ;ZIP")  # Or DEB, RPM, NSIS, DragNDrop, etc.
include(CPack)
```

**Creating packages:**
```bash
cmake --build build
cmake --install build --prefix staging
cd build && cpack
```

**Common generators:**
- **TGZ/ZIP** - Cross-platform archives
- **DEB** - Debian/Ubuntu packages
- **RPM** - RedHat/Fedora packages
- **NSIS** - Windows installer
- **DragNDrop** - macOS DMG

For complete CPack guide including platform-specific packaging, component installation, and best practices, see `references/cpack.md`.

## Workflow Guidelines

### When User Asks for Help

1. **Understand context** - What are they trying to accomplish?
2. **Check documentation** - If uncertain, verify against CMake docs
3. **Provide complete examples** - Full CMakeLists.txt when relevant
4. **Address debugging systematically** - Use diagnostic steps from `references/debugging.md`

### Response Strategy

**Explanations:**
- Start with high-level concept before details
- Use concrete examples
- Anticipate follow-up questions
- Link concepts together

**Code examples:**
- Provide complete, working examples
- Use modern CMake syntax
- Add comments for non-obvious parts
- Show both producer and consumer sides

**Error resolution:**
- Provide specific diagnostic steps
- List potential causes in order of likelihood
- Verify assumptions with documentation
- If previous advice didn't work, search docs before trying again

## Common Tasks

### Creating a Distributable Library

**Quick checklist:**
- [ ] Create library target with `add_library()`
- [ ] Set include directories with generator expressions
- [ ] Link dependencies with proper visibility
- [ ] Install targets with `install(TARGETS ... EXPORT ...)`
- [ ] Install headers with `install(DIRECTORY include/)`
- [ ] Create Config.cmake with `configure_package_config_file()`
- [ ] Create version file with `write_basic_package_version_file()`
- [ ] Install config files

For complete example, see `references/examples.md`.

### Debugging find_package Issues

**Systematic approach:**
1. Enable debug mode: `set(CMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE TRUE)`
2. Check search paths: `message(STATUS "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: ${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}")`
3. Verify package location
4. Check package naming (case sensitive!)

For detailed troubleshooting, see `references/debugging.md`.

### Common Pitfalls

**Headers not found after find_package:**
- Cause: Not linking the target
- Solution: Use `target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE Package::target)`

**Exported target not found:**
- Cause: Config.cmake doesn't include Targets file
- Solution: Add `include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/Targets.cmake")`

**PARENT_SCOPE confusion:**
- Cause: PARENT_SCOPE sets in parent, not current scope
- Solution: Set locally first, then set with PARENT_SCOPE

For all common pitfalls, see `references/pitfalls.md`.

## Reference Documentation

The skill includes detailed reference documentation:

- **`references/quick-reference.md`** - Copy-paste ready syntax and checklists
- **`references/pitfalls.md`** - Common mistakes and solutions
- **`references/ctest.md`** - Testing with CTest (running tests, test properties, fixtures, CI integration)
- **`references/cpack.md`** - Creating distributable packages (installers, .deb, .rpm, etc.)
- **`references/targets.md`** - Deep dive on targets and properties (to be created as needed)
- **`references/find-package.md`** - Complete find_package guide (to be created as needed)
- **`references/fetchcontent.md`** - FetchContent patterns and best practices (to be created as needed)
- **`references/functions-macros.md`** - Functions, macros, scope, and argument parsing (to be created as needed)
- **`references/debugging.md`** - Systematic debugging approaches (to be created as needed)
- **`references/examples.md`** - Complete working examples (to be created as needed)

**When to consult references:**
- User needs detailed explanation beyond quick answer
- Complex topic requires comprehensive coverage
- User asks for complete examples
- Debugging requires systematic approach

## Remember

- **Documentation over assumptions** - Verify against CMake docs when uncertain
- **Target-centric thinking** - Modern CMake is all about targets
- **Complete examples** - Users need working code, not fragments
- **Systematic debugging** - Follow logical troubleshooting process
- **User feedback** - If approach didn't work, investigate before alternatives
- **Use reference docs** - Detailed information in `references/` folder

## Response Checklist
