# Dual-Remote Push

Use this skill **only when the user explicitly asks** to push to both remotes (e.g. "push ke keduanya", "push both", "sync ke kedua remote"). Do not run automatically on every push.

## Purpose

- Work in a **corporate private repo** (primary).
- Keep a **clone in the user's internal/personal repo** so their GitHub shows activity.
- **Two remotes**: `upstream` = corporate (default), `origin` = internal.
- On demand: push the same branch to **both** remotes.

## One-Time Setup (if not already done)

In the repo:

```bash
# Corporate repo is already the default (e.g. cloned from corporate)
git remote -v
# If "origin" points to corporate, rename it to upstream and add internal as origin:

git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin <URL-repo-internal-user>
```

If the repo was cloned from corporate and you want to keep corporate as default:

- `upstream` → corporate repo
- `origin` → user's internal repo

Ensure default push/pull stays with corporate (e.g. `git config branch.<branch>.remote upstream` if needed).

## When User Asks to Push to Both

1. Confirm current branch (e.g. `main` or `feature/xyz`).
2. Push to **upstream** (corporate) first:
   ```bash
   git push upstream <branch>
   ```
3. Push to **origin** (internal) second:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch>
   ```
4. If both use the same branch name (e.g. `main`):
   ```bash
   git push upstream <branch> && git push origin <branch>
   ```

## Rules

- **Only run when invoked.** Do not suggest or run this on every "git push" unless the user asked for "push ke keduanya" or equivalent.
- **Default remote** for normal work remains corporate (upstream).
- If push to one remote fails, report the error and do not push to the other until the user fixes it (e.g. permissions, branch protection).

## Checklist (when running)

- [ ] User explicitly asked to push to both remotes
- [ ] Current branch identified
- [ ] Pushed to upstream (corporate)
- [ ] Pushed to origin (internal)
