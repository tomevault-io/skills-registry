## TL;DR
Parse user request into structured intent JSON (goal, constraints, complexity). Trigger Socratic Gate for complex or ambiguous scope. Suggest an agent route after classification. Wait for explicit confirmation before implementation. For large repos: read index files first, max 20 files deep-read per task.

# Intent and Context Analyzer

## Activation

1. Activate for any request that implies code or documentation changes.
2. Activate on explicit `$codex-intent-context-analyzer` or `$intent`.
3. Skip for purely informational questions with no requested edits.

## Output Contract

Always return a fenced JSON block in conversation:

```json
{
  "intent": "build | fix | review | debug | docs | refactor | deploy | handoff | other",
  "goal": "One-sentence description",
  "pain_points": ["Problems extracted from the prompt"],
  "constraints": ["Technical or business constraints"],
  "missing_info": ["Information needed but not provided"],
  "normalized_prompt": "Clean rewrite of the user request",
  "complexity": "simple | complex",
  "needs_confirmation": true,
  "suggested_agent": "frontend-specialist | backend-specialist | security-auditor | debugger | test-engineer | devops-engineer | planner | scrum-master | null"
}
```

Keep every existing field exactly as-is. The only additive extension is `suggested_agent`.

## Auto-Agent Routing

After classifying intent, select the best primary agent from `skills/.agents/` and announce it in conversation:

`🤖 Routing to @[agent-name]...`

| Intent | Primary Agent | Secondary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| build (frontend) | `frontend-specialist` | `test-engineer` |
| build (backend) | `backend-specialist` | `test-engineer` |
| fix or debug | `debugger` | — |
| review or audit | `security-auditor` | — |
| deploy | `devops-engineer` | `security-auditor` |
| plan | `planner` | — |
| scrum | `scrum-master` | — |

### Routing Notes

- Keep the existing `intent` enum unchanged. `plan` and `scrum` are routing overlays, not new required JSON intent literals.
- For build requests, use domain signals to choose frontend vs backend primary ownership.
- When a strong secondary fit exists, mention it in prose after the routing line instead of adding another JSON field.
- If no confident route exists, set `suggested_agent` to `null` and continue with the normal clarification flow.

## Socratic Gate

Trigger Socratic Gate for `complexity: complex` or ambiguous scope.

### Trigger Conditions

- Build/create requests with vague requirements.
- Multi-file or architecture-level work.
- Requests with missing constraints or success criteria.
- "Just do it" requests with unclear scope.

### Mandatory Questions

Ask at least 3 questions covering:

1. Purpose: what problem is being solved.
2. Users: who is affected.
3. Scope: must-have vs nice-to-have.

### Question Quality Rules

- Generate questions dynamically for this task (do not reuse static boilerplate).
- Tie each question to an implementation decision.
- Present trade-offs and a default assumption.

Format:

- Question: ...
- Why it matters: ...
- Options: A vs B ...
- Default if unspecified: ...

### Special Cases

- If user already gave stack/tooling, ask edge-case and trade-off questions.
- If user says "just do it", still ask 2 short boundary questions.

## Confirmation Rule

- Keep `needs_confirmation` true by default.
- Present analysis first and wait for explicit confirmation.
- Do not start implementation until confirmed.

## Fallback

If `intent` is `other`, ask user to rephrase or choose one of:
`build`, `fix`, `review`, `debug`, `docs`, `refactor`, `deploy`, `handoff`.

## Script Invocation Discipline

1. When this workflow calls helper scripts from other skills, run `--help` first.
2. Treat helper scripts as black-box tools and execute by contract before reading source.
3. Read script source only when customization or bug-fixing is required.

## Repo Comprehension Protocol

For repositories with more than 50 files:

1. Read index files first: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CODEBASE.md`, `README.md`.
2. Build a lightweight map:
   - top-level directories (depth <= 2)
   - likely entry points (`main`, `index`, `app`, `server`)
   - config files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.)
3. Load by scope, not globally:
   - fix: target module + related tests/docs
   - build: target area + nearby tests/docs
4. Use progressive disclosure:
   - outline first (exports/functions/classes)
   - deep-read only directly relevant files
5. Deep-read budget: max 20 files per task unless user approves expansion.
6. If uncertain scope, ask user before broad exploration.
