# Polymarket Capability

Interact with Polymarket prediction markets via natural language prompts.

## What You Can Do

| Operation | Example Prompt |
|-----------|----------------|
| Search markets | `Search Polymarket for election` |
| Trending markets | `What prediction markets are trending?` |
| Check odds | `What are the odds Trump wins?` |
| Market details | `Show details for the Super Bowl market` |
| Bet Yes | `Bet $10 on Yes for the election market` |
| Bet No | `Bet $5 on No for Bitcoin hitting 100k` |
| View positions | `Show my Polymarket positions` |
| Redeem winnings | `Redeem my Polymarket positions` |

## Prompt Patterns

```
Search Polymarket for {query}
What are the odds {event}?
Bet {amount} on {Yes|No} for {market}
Show my Polymarket positions
Redeem my Polymarket positions
```

**Chain:** Polygon (uses USDC.e for betting)
