# Socratic Questioning Skill

Apply the Socratic method to probe deeper into problems, expose assumptions, and guide users toward clearer thinking through strategic questioning.

## When to Apply

- **Requirements gathering**: Uncover hidden or assumed requirements
- **Design decisions**: Challenge architectural choices and trade-offs
- **Debugging**: Trace root causes through systematic inquiry
- **Decision making**: Expose unstated criteria and biases
- **Documentation**: Ensure completeness before writing
- **Code review**: Question design choices, not just implementation

## The Six Question Types

Use these question categories strategically:

### 1. Clarification Questions

Probe the basics to ensure shared understanding.

- "What do you mean by X?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "How does this relate to Y?"
- "What's the core problem you're trying to solve?"

### 2. Probing Assumptions

Uncover unstated beliefs that may be wrong.

- "What are you assuming here?"
- "Why do you believe X is true?"
- "What would happen if that assumption was wrong?"
- "Is this always the case, or just sometimes?"

### 3. Probing Evidence/Reasoning

Examine the basis for conclusions.

- "How do you know this?"
- "What evidence supports this?"
- "Is there an alternative explanation?"
- "What led you to this conclusion?"

### 4. Questioning Viewpoints/Perspectives

Consider alternative angles.

- "How would [stakeholder X] see this?"
- "What would a skeptic say?"
- "Are there other ways to look at this?"
- "What's the strongest counter-argument?"

### 5. Probing Implications/Consequences

Trace the downstream effects.

- "If this is true, what follows?"
- "What would be the impact on X?"
- "How does this affect Y?"
- "What are the second-order effects?"

### 6. Questions About the Question

Meta-level inquiry to reframe the problem.

- "Why is this the question we're asking?"
- "Is there a more fundamental question?"
- "What would answering this actually tell us?"
- "Are we solving the right problem?"

## Application Patterns

### Pattern 1: Assumption Drill-Down

Use when: User states something as fact without evidence.

```
User: "We need to use microservices"
→ "What's driving the need for microservices specifically?"
→ "What problems would microservices solve that a monolith wouldn't?"
→ "What would happen if you started with a monolith?"
→ "What's the cost of being wrong about this decision?"
```

### Pattern 2: Requirements Excavation

Use when: Requirements seem incomplete or surface-level.

```
User: "Users need to log in"
→ "What happens after login?"
→ "What if login fails?"
→ "Do all users need the same access?"
→ "What does 'logged in' mean in terms of session duration?"
→ "What's the worst thing that could happen if auth is bypassed?"
```

### Pattern 3: Trade-off Illumination

Use when: User hasn't considered trade-offs.

```
User: "We'll cache everything"
→ "What happens when the cache is stale?"
→ "How will you know if cached data is wrong?"
→ "What's the cost of a cache miss?"
→ "What if the cache fails entirely?"
```

### Pattern 4: Edge Case Discovery

Use when: User describes happy path only.

```
User: "User clicks submit, data saves"
→ "What if they click submit twice?"
→ "What if the network fails mid-save?"
→ "What if another user edited the same record?"
→ "What if the data is invalid?"
```

## Execution Guidelines

### Pacing

- Start soft: Begin with clarification questions
- Build momentum: Move to assumption-probing as trust builds
- Go deep: Don't stop at the first answer—keep asking "why"
- Know when to stop: When user reaches genuine insight or answers become consistent

### Tone

- Collaborative, not interrogative
- Signal curiosity: "I'm wondering..." / "Help me understand..."
- Praise good thinking: "That's a good point. Now what about..."

### Integrate with Other Skills

- **With doc-coauthoring**: Use in Stage 1 (Context Gathering) and Stage 2 (Gap Check)
- **With code-reviewer**: Question design decisions, not just syntax
- **With frontend-design**: Challenge UX assumptions

### When to Stop

- User has articulated a clear, defensible position
- Same answers keep appearing (saturation)
- User explicitly wants to move forward
- Questions become circular

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

| Anti-pattern                 | Why it fails                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Rapid-fire questions         | Feels like interrogation       |
| Leading questions            | Imposes your conclusion        |
| Asking what you already know | Wastes time, condescending     |
| Ignoring answers             | Makes user feel unheard        |
| Never stopping               | Frustrates and blocks progress |

## Quick Reference

**Start with**: "Help me understand..." / "What makes you say..."
**Probe assumptions**: "What are we taking for granted?"
**Find gaps**: "What happens if X fails?"
**Challenge**: "What would convince you this is wrong?"
**Stop when**: User reaches clarity or explicitly moves on
