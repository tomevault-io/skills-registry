# Performance Optimization

Performance is a feature. Users perceive slow software as broken software. Measure first, optimize the bottlenecks, and know when to stop. Make it work, make it right, make it fast—in that order.

## Performance Fundamentals

### The Performance Mindset

- **Measure, don't guess**: Profile before optimizing. The bottleneck is rarely where you think it is.
- **Optimize for the common case**: 80% of time is spent in 20% of code. Find and fix that 20%.
- **Set budgets**: Define acceptable thresholds. Treat budget violations as bugs.
- **Perceived vs. actual**: Users care about perceived performance. Sometimes making something feel fast is better than making it actually fast.

### Performance Budget Example

| Metric | Budget | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Time to Interactive | < 3.5s | Critical |
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.5s | High |
| API Response (p95) | < 500ms | High |
| JavaScript Bundle | < 200KB | Medium |
| Largest Contentful Paint | < 2.5s | High |

## Frontend Performance

### Critical Rendering Path

The sequence of steps to render the first pixels:
1. **HTML parsing** → Build DOM
2. **CSS parsing** → Build CSSOM
3. **JavaScript execution** → Potentially blocks both
4. **Render tree** → Combine DOM + CSSOM
5. **Layout** → Calculate positions
6. **Paint** → Draw pixels

**Optimization strategies**:
- Minimize critical resources (inline critical CSS)
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Reduce render-blocking resources
- Optimize the order of resource loading

### Loading Performance

**Reduce payload size**:
- Minify and compress (gzip/brotli)
- Tree-shake unused code
- Optimize images (WebP, AVIF, responsive sizes)
- Remove unused CSS and JavaScript

**Reduce requests**:
- Bundle related resources
- Use HTTP/2 multiplexing
- Inline critical resources
- Preconnect to required origins

**Cache aggressively**:
- Immutable assets with long cache headers
- Service workers for offline and cache control
- CDN for static assets
- Browser caching with proper cache headers

### Runtime Performance

**Rendering efficiency**:
- Avoid layout thrashing (batch DOM reads/writes)
- Use CSS transforms over layout-triggering properties
- Virtualize long lists
- Debounce scroll and resize handlers

**JavaScript efficiency**:
- Avoid blocking the main thread
- Use Web Workers for heavy computation
- Break long tasks into smaller chunks
- Profile and optimize hot paths

**Memory management**:
- Clean up event listeners
- Avoid memory leaks in closures
- Use weak references where appropriate
- Monitor heap size over time

## Backend Performance

### Database Optimization

**Query optimization**:
- Use indexes for filtered and sorted columns
- Avoid SELECT *; fetch only needed columns
- Use EXPLAIN to understand query plans
- Batch operations to reduce round trips

**Common query patterns**:
| Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| N+1 queries | One query per item in loop | Eager load, batch fetch |
| Full table scan | No index for WHERE clause | Add appropriate index |
| Sorting in app | Large result sets sorted in memory | Sort in database with index |
| Over-fetching | Retrieving unused columns | Select only needed fields |

**Connection management**:
- Use connection pooling
- Size pools appropriately
- Monitor connection usage and wait times
- Handle connection failures gracefully

### Caching Strategies

**Cache layers** (from fastest to slowest):
1. CPU cache: Automatic, algorithm-dependent
2. In-memory (application): Fast, per-instance
3. Distributed cache: Fast, shared across instances
4. CDN: Fast, geographically distributed
5. Database cache: Query result caching

**Cache invalidation strategies**:
| Strategy | Description | Use When |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| TTL (Time-to-Live) | Expire after duration | Acceptable staleness |
| Write-through | Update cache on write | Strong consistency needed |
| Write-behind | Async cache update | Write performance critical |
| Event-based | Invalidate on events | Complex dependencies |

**Cache key design**: Include all parameters that affect the result, use consistent hashing for distributed caches, namespace to allow selective invalidation.

### API Performance

**Reduce latency**:
- Minimize round trips (batch endpoints)
- Use pagination for large results
- Compress responses
- Keep payloads minimal

**Handle load**:
- Rate limiting to prevent overload
- Circuit breakers for failing dependencies
- Graceful degradation under stress
- Queue long-running operations

## Network Performance

### Latency Reduction

**Minimize round trips**:
- Reduce DNS lookups (fewer domains)
- Use persistent connections (keep-alive)
- Batch API requests
- Prefetch predictable resources

**Reduce distance**:
- CDN for static assets
- Edge computing for dynamic content
- Geographic load balancing
- Region-specific deployments

### Protocol Optimization

**HTTP/2 benefits**: Multiplexing (parallel requests on one connection), header compression, server push, stream prioritization.

**When HTTP/3/QUIC helps**: High latency networks, lossy connections (mobile), connection migration.

## Perceived Performance

Make it feel faster when you can't make it actually faster.

### Instant Feedback

**Optimistic updates**: Show success before confirmation
- Update UI immediately on user action
- Roll back if server rejects
- Works for most create/update operations

**Skeleton screens**: Show structure while loading
- Better than spinners for content-heavy pages
- Indicates what's coming
- Reduces perceived wait time

**Progress indicators**: Show something is happening
- Determinate progress when duration is known
- Indeterminate for unknown duration
- Avoid spinners for < 1 second operations

### Preloading and Prefetching

**Preload**: Fetch resources needed for current page (critical fonts, above-fold images).

**Prefetch**: Fetch resources for likely next pages (on hover over links, based on user behavior prediction).

**Preconnect**: Establish connections early to known third-party origins.

## Measurement

### Key Metrics

**User-centric metrics**:
| Metric | Question Answered |
|--------|-------------------|
| First Contentful Paint (FCP) | When does something appear? |
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | When is main content visible? |
| Time to Interactive (TTI) | When can users interact? |
| Total Blocking Time (TBT) | How much does JS block the main thread? |
| Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) | How much does the page jump around? |
| Interaction to Next Paint (INP) | How responsive is the page? |

**Server-side metrics**:
| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| Response time (p50, p95, p99) | Typical and worst-case latency |
| Throughput | Requests per second |
| Error rate | Failed requests percentage |
| Time to First Byte (TTFB) | Server processing time |

### Profiling Approach

1. **Establish baseline**: Measure current performance
2. **Identify bottlenecks**: Use profilers to find hot spots
3. **Hypothesize**: Form theory about the cause
4. **Experiment**: Make targeted changes
5. **Measure again**: Verify improvement
6. **Iterate or stop**: Repeat if needed, stop when budget met

### Monitoring

**Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Captures real-world conditions, shows performance distribution, identifies slow regions/devices.

**Synthetic Monitoring**: Consistent baseline for comparison, catches regressions in CI/CD, doesn't capture real-world variance.

## Common Pitfalls

### Premature Optimization
Optimizing before understanding the problem.
**Fix**: Profile first. Optimize hot paths only.

### Over-Caching
Caching everything without strategy.
**Fix**: Cache deliberately. Start without caching, add when needed.

### Optimizing the Wrong Layer
Fast database, slow application, or vice versa.
**Fix**: Measure end-to-end. Optimize the actual bottleneck.

### Ignoring the Long Tail
Focusing only on averages, missing p99 users.
**Fix**: Monitor percentiles (p95, p99). Optimize worst cases.

### Death by a Thousand Cuts
Many small inefficiencies that add up.
**Fix**: Audit dependencies, remove unnecessary work, simplify architecture.
