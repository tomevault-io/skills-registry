# Android TV Planning Partner

Plan Android TV features through interactive Q&A sessions that analyze your codebase and produce comprehensive planning documents saved to `planning/{featureName}/planning.md`.

## Planning Workflow

When the user wants to plan an Android TV feature, follow these steps:

### 1. Gather Context

Start by understanding what needs to be built:

**Ask the user:**
- What is the feature you want to build? (Get a clear, concise description)
- What is the high-level user goal or problem this solves?
- Are there any existing features or components this relates to?
- What Android TV API level should this support? (minimum API level)
- Are you using Leanback library, Compose for TV, or custom UI?

**Explore the codebase:**
- Search for similar existing features or components
- Identify relevant patterns, conventions, and architecture
- Note existing Activities, Fragments, and ViewModels
- Find related API endpoints or data models
- Check existing use of Leanback components or Compose for TV
- Identify navigation patterns (NavGraph, manual navigation)

### 2. Interactive Planning Session

Lead a focused Q&A session covering these critical areas in order:

#### A. Architecture & Components

**Ask about:**
- Should this be a new Activity, Fragment, or composable?
- What's the component hierarchy? (Activity → Fragment → Views/Composables)
- Are you using MVVM, MVI, or another architecture pattern?
- What existing components can be reused vs need to be created?
- Should this integrate with Leanback library or use custom UI?
- Are you using Jetpack Compose for TV?

**Suggest:**
- Component breakdown following single responsibility
- ViewModel for business logic and state management
- Repository pattern for data access
- Use of Leanback browse/details fragments when appropriate
- Proper Activity/Fragment lifecycle management
- Compose for TV components (if using Compose)

**Android TV UI Patterns:**
- BrowseFragment for main content browsing
- DetailsFragment for content details
- SearchFragment for search functionality
- PlaybackFragment for video playback controls
- Custom fragments for unique experiences

#### B. Leanback Library vs Custom UI

**Ask about:**
- Are you using Leanback library?
- If yes, which Leanback components? (BrowseSupportFragment, etc.)
- If custom UI, how are you handling D-pad navigation?
- Are you using Compose for TV or traditional Views?
- What's your navigation approach?

**Leanback Components:**
- BrowseSupportFragment: Main browsing interface
- DetailsSupportFragment: Content details screen
- VerticalGridSupportFragment: Grid layout
- GuidedStepSupportFragment: Wizard-style flows
- PlaybackSupportFragment: Video playback UI

**Compose for TV:**

#### C. D-Pad Navigation & Focus Management

**Ask about:**
- How should D-pad navigation flow through the UI?
- What's the focus order?
- Are there any focus traps to handle?
- How should focus be restored when navigating back?
- Are there spatial navigation complexities?

**Suggest:**
- Proper nextFocusUp/Down/Left/Right attributes
- Focus highlight implementation
- Focus management in RecyclerView/LazyRow

**Android TV Navigation:**
- D-pad directional navigation (up/down/left/right)
- Center button (OK/Select)
- Back button handling
- Home button (exits to launcher)
- Menu button (contextual actions)

#### D. Data Flow & API Integration

**Ask about:**
- What data does this feature need?
- Where does the data come from? (API, Room DB, DataStore)
- How should data flow through components?
- What API endpoints exist or need to be created?
- Should data be cached or refetched?
- Are you using Retrofit, Ktor, or another networking library?

**Suggest:**
- ViewModel + LiveData/StateFlow for reactive UI
- Repository pattern for data layer
- Room database for local caching
- DataStore for preferences
- Coroutines for async operations
- Paging library for large datasets

**Android Architecture:**
- MVVM with ViewModel and LiveData/Flow
- Repository layer for data abstraction
- Use cases for complex business logic
- Dependency injection (Hilt, Koin)

#### E. UI/UX Considerations (10-Foot Interface)

**Ask about:**
- What's the user interaction flow with remote control?
- How should content be displayed? (browse, grid, details)
- What are the different UI states? (loading, error, empty, success)
- Are there video/audio playback requirements?
- What animations or transitions are needed?
- Should this support both light and dark themes?

**Suggest:**
- Loading states with progress indicators
- Error screens with retry actions
- Empty state messaging
- Focus animations and scaling effects
- Card-based layouts for content
- Use of Leanback theme or custom theme

**10-Foot UI Best Practices:**
- Large touch targets (minimum 48dp)
- Clear visual focus indicators
- High contrast colors for readability
- Safe zone margins (48dp from edges)
- Readable text sizes (14sp minimum)
- Clear visual hierarchy

#### F. Video/Media Playback

**If feature involves video:**

**Ask about:**

- What video formats need to be supported?
- Are there DRM requirements?
- Should playback controls be custom or use Leanback?
- How should playback state be managed?
- Are there picture-in-picture requirements?

**Suggest:**
- ExoPlayer for modern video playback
- Leanback PlaybackSupportFragment for controls
- MediaSession for media controls
- Proper handling of playback lifecycle
- Background audio considerations

**Media Playback Considerations:**
- HLS, DASH, or other adaptive streaming
- Offline playback support
- Subtitle/caption handling
- Audio track selection
- Playback quality adaptation
- Resume from last position

#### G. Performance & Memory Management

**Ask about:**
- Are there large lists that need optimization?
- How many items might be displayed at once?
- Are there background tasks or services?
- Should images be cached or lazy loaded?
- What's the expected image/bitmap memory usage?

**Suggest:**
- RecyclerView with ViewHolder pattern (or Compose LazyRow/Column)
