description: Create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for new features or products. Use this skill when the user asks to create a PRD, product spec, feature specification, or product requirements. Generates structured, detailed documentation covering problem statement, user stories, requirements, success metrics, and technical considerations. Use when this capability is needed.

This skill guides creation of comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that clearly define product features, requirements, and success criteria.

The user provides a feature idea, product concept, or requirement that needs to be documented. The skill helps structure this into a professional PRD that serves as a source of truth for development.

## PRD Structure

A complete PRD should include the following sections:

### 1. Overview
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive name for the feature/product
- **Author**: Document owner
- **Date**: Created/last updated
- **Status**: Draft, In Review, Approved, or In Development

### 2. Problem Statement
- What problem are we solving?
- Who experiences this problem?
- Why is this important to solve now?
- What happens if we don't solve it?

### 3. Goals & Success Metrics
- **Primary Goals**: What are we trying to achieve?
- **Success Metrics**: How will we measure success? (quantifiable KPIs)
- **Non-Goals**: What is explicitly out of scope?

### 4. User Stories & Personas
- Who are the target users?
- What are their needs and pain points?
- User stories in format: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"

### 5. Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- Core features and functionality (numbered list)
- User interactions and workflows
- Business logic and rules

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance expectations
- Security requirements
- Accessibility standards
- Browser/device support

### 6. User Experience

#### User Flow
- Step-by-step walkthrough of the user journey
- Entry points and exit points
- Decision trees and branching logic

#### Wireframes/Mockups (if applicable)
- Visual representation of key screens
- Navigation patterns
- Component specifications

### 7. Technical Considerations
- Architecture implications
- Data model changes
- API requirements
- Third-party integrations
- Performance considerations
- Migration/rollout strategy

### 8. Dependencies & Assumptions
- What needs to exist before this can be built?
- What are we assuming to be true?
- Blockers or risks

### 9. Open Questions
- Unresolved decisions
- Areas needing further research
- Items requiring stakeholder input

### 10. Timeline & Milestones
- Proposed phases or milestones (avoid specific dates, focus on sequence)
- MVP vs. full feature scope
- Release strategy

## Workflow

When creating a PRD:

1. **Gather Context**: Ask clarifying questions about the feature/product:
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who is the target user?
   - What are the must-have vs. nice-to-have features?
   - Are there any constraints (technical, timeline, resources)?

2. **Research Existing Patterns**: If working in an existing codebase:
   - Review similar features for consistency
   - Understand current architecture and patterns
   - Identify reusable components or patterns

3. **Structure the Document**: Create a well-organized PRD following the structure above:
   - Start with a clear problem statement
   - Define measurable success criteria
   - Detail requirements with specificity
   - Include user flows and technical considerations

4. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague language:
   - ❌ "The system should be fast"
   - ✅ "API responses should return in <200ms for 95% of requests"

   - ❌ "Users can manage their profile"
   - ✅ "Users can update their name, email, avatar, and notification preferences from the profile settings page"

5. **Validate Completeness**: Ensure the PRD answers:
   - WHY: Why are we building this?
   - WHO: Who is this for?
   - WHAT: What exactly are we building?
   - HOW: How will it work (user perspective)?
   - WHEN: What's the phased approach?
   - SUCCESS: How do we know it's working?

## Output Format

Generate the PRD as a well-formatted Markdown document based on the [template](./TEMPLATE.md) that can be saved to the project's documentation directory (e.g., `docs/prd/` or `.github/prd/`).

Use clear formatting:
- Headings for sections
- Numbered lists for requirements
- Tables for comparing options
- Code blocks for technical specs
- Checkboxes for tracking items

## Best Practices

- **Clarity over Cleverness**: Write for diverse audiences (designers, engineers, PMs, stakeholders)
- **Measurable Goals**: Every goal should have quantifiable success metrics
- **User-Centric**: Always tie back to user value and problems being solved
- **Living Document**: PRDs should evolve; include revision history
- **Validate Assumptions**: Call out what's assumed vs. validated
- **Scope Management**: Clearly define what's in scope vs. out of scope
- **Visual Aids**: Include diagrams, flows, and mockups when helpful

## Example Usage

User: "Create a PRD for adding a shopping cart to our e-commerce site"

Agent should:
1. Ask clarifying questions (guest checkout? saved carts? cart sharing?)
2. Research existing product/checkout patterns in the codebase
3. Generate comprehensive PRD covering all sections
4. Save to appropriate location (e.g., `docs/prd/shopping-cart.md`)
