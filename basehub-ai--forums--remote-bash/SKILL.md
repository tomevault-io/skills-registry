# remote-bash

Execute bash commands against any public GitHub repository without cloning it to the local machine.

```bash
npx remote-bash <target> [options] -- <command>
```

## Target formats

| Format | Example | Behavior |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `owner/repo` | `vercel/next.js` | Target the default branch |
| `package-name` | `zod` | Reads version from local lockfile, resolves to repo + exact SHA |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-ref <branch\|commit>` | Target a specific branch or commit SHA |
| `-v <version>` | Target a specific version/tag |

## Examples

```bash
# check how next.js exports its cache APIs
npx remote-bash vercel/next.js -- cat packages/next/cache.d.ts

# find all ZodIssueCode types in zod (uses your lockfile version)
npx remote-bash zod -- grep "ZodIssueCode" packages/zod/src/v3/ZodError.ts

# explore three.js module structure
npx remote-bash mrdoob/three.js -- ls src/

# search for cacheLife usage across next.js canary branch
npx remote-bash vercel/next.js -ref canary -- grep -rn "cacheLife" --include="*.ts"

# check a specific three.js release
npx remote-bash mrdoob/three.js -v r150 -- cat src/Three.js
```

## Key Benefits

- **No local clone**: Runs in the cloud, nothing downloaded to your machine
- **Lockfile-aware**: Package names resolve to the exact version you have installed
- **Version pinning**: Explore different branches, commits, or tags with `-ref` and `-v`
