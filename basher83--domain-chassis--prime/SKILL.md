# Prime — Session Context Loading

Read the domain's core files and summarize the current state for the operator.

## Process

### Step 1 — Load Doctrine

Discover the domain's doctrine file at the workspace root. Look for files matching known domain doctrine names: `FORGE.md`, `WORKSHOP.md`, `LAB.md`, `RESEARCH.md`. Read whichever one exists.

If multiple doctrine files are found, warn the operator — a workspace should belong to exactly one domain. If no doctrine file is found, note its absence and continue with the remaining steps.

### Step 2 — Load Project Index

Read `PIN.md` at the workspace root — the project index tracking what's here and what state it's in. If PIN.md does not exist, note its absence and skip.

List the subdirectories in the workspace root to cross-reference against PIN.md entries. Exclude `gates/` — that's the gate archive, not a project. Validate PIN.md against the [workspace standard](references/workspace-standard.md). Flag stale status values, PIN.md entries without a directory on disk, or directories on disk without PIN.md entries. Don't block on these — report them as part of the summary.

List files at the workspace root (not subdirectories). The expected set is: the domain doctrine file, PIN.md, QUEUE.md, TRIAGE.md, and any active gate files matching `Q*-gate.md`. Flag any file not in this set as unexpected — it may be an orphaned artifact, an uncleared gate that wasn't moved to `gates/`, or scratch work that should be filed or removed. Report unexpected files as part of the summary alongside any directory mismatches. Don't block on these.

### Step 3 — Load Queue

Read `QUEUE.md` at the workspace root — the operational intent tracker. If QUEUE.md does not exist, note its absence and skip.

### Step 4 — Check Triage

Check `TRIAGE.md` — raw intake. Only check whether content exists below the `---` separator. If content exists, output exactly this line and nothing more: "TRIAGE.md has pending intake — triage when ready?" Do not read the file contents. Do not list, describe, or summarize what is in TRIAGE.md. The operator knows what they put there.

### Step 5 — Summarize

Summarize current state: active projects, what state they're in, what needs attention, and what the operator is currently working on (from the queue).

Keep the summary concise. Focus on current state: what's in flight, what's converged, what needs attention, and what intent is queued. If workspace hygiene issues are found, note them briefly at the end.
