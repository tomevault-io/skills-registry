# Zammad MCP Quality Guardian

## Purpose

Ensure consistent, high-quality contributions to the Zammad MCP project by:

1. **Preventing recurring issues** flagged by CodeRabbit
2. **Providing actionable checklists** for self-review
3. **Capturing project learnings** in accessible references
4. **Systematic improvement** through feedback loop integration

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when:

- **Before creating a PR** - Self-review with checklist
- **Implementing MCP tools** - Follow established patterns
- **Adding pagination** - Use correct metadata structure
- **Handling errors** - Create actionable messages
- **Addressing CodeRabbit feedback** - Learn patterns, not just fix issues
- **Onboarding to project** - Understand quality standards
- **Monthly review** - Update learnings from recent PRs

## Workflow

### 1. Pre-Development (Optional)

When starting a new feature, review relevant references:

**For pagination features:**
→ Read [pagination-patterns.md](./references/pagination-patterns.md)

**For error handling:**
→ Read [error-handling-guide.md](./references/error-handling-guide.md)

**For type-heavy code:**
→ Read [type-annotation-standards.md](./references/type-annotation-standards.md)

### 2. During Development

Keep patterns in mind while coding:

- Use Python 3.10+ type syntax
- Provide actionable error messages
- Structure pagination metadata correctly
- Follow naming conventions (no shadowing)

### 3. Pre-PR Self-Review (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS run through the checklist before creating a PR:**

→ Open [pre-pr-checklist.md](./references/pre-pr-checklist.md)

This takes 5-10 minutes but reduces review iterations by 60-70%.

**Quick quality check:**

```bash
# From project root
./scripts/quality-check.sh && uv run pytest --cov=mcp_zammad
```

### 4. After CodeRabbit Review

**When CodeRabbit comments on your PR:**

1. **Fix the immediate issue** in your code
2. **Understand the pattern** - don't just copy-paste
3. **Check if pattern is documented** in this skill
   - If yes: Review reference to avoid future occurrences
   - If no: Consider if pattern should be added
4. **Search codebase** for similar instances
5. **Update learnings** if pattern recurs (see Update Process below)

### 5. Monthly Review (Maintainers)

**Process for keeping skill current:**

1. Review last 10 merged PRs
2. Note recurring CodeRabbit feedback
3. Update [coderabbit-learnings.md](./references/coderabbit-learnings.md)
4. Update [pre-pr-checklist.md](./references/pre-pr-checklist.md) if needed
5. Refine reference guides based on new patterns

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes/month

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Before Creating a PR

```text
User: "I'm ready to create a PR for the new search filter feature"

Claude: Let me help you with pre-PR review using the Zammad MCP Quality skill.

*Reviews pre-pr-checklist.md*

I'll check your code against the quality checklist:

1. Type Annotations ✓
   - All functions have return types
   - Using modern list[str] syntax
   - No parameter shadowing

2. Pagination ⚠️
   - Found: response["total"] = len(items)
   - Should be: total from API or None
   - See pagination-patterns.md line 45

3. Error Handling ✓
   - Messages are actionable
   - Using proper exception chaining

Let me fix the pagination issue before you create the PR...
```

### Example 2: Implementing New Tool

```text
User: "Add a new tool for managing ticket watchers"

Claude: I'll implement following Zammad MCP patterns from the quality skill.

*Checks coderabbit-learnings.md for relevant patterns*

Key patterns to follow:
1. Use Pydantic model for input (TicketSearchParams pattern)
2. Support ResponseFormat.JSON and .MARKDOWN
3. Clear docstring explaining ID vs number (from Issue #99 learnings)
4. Proper error handling with actionable messages

*Reviews error-handling-guide.md for message templates*

Implementing tool with these quality standards...
```

### Example 3: Addressing CodeRabbit Feedback

```text
CodeRabbit: "The 'total' field is set to page count, not true total across all pages."

Claude: Let me check the pagination-patterns.md guide...

*Reviews pagination-patterns.md section on "Common Mistakes"*

I see - this is a known pattern. The guide shows:

❌ Wrong: response["total"] = len(tickets)
✅ Correct: response["total"] = total_from_api  # or None if unknown

Let me fix this and also check for similar instances in the codebase...

*Searches for pattern in other pagination functions*

Found 3 other locations with same issue. Fixing all...

*Updates coderabbit-learnings.md with occurrence count*
```

### Leading Indicators

- CodeRabbit comments per PR (Target: < 5)
- Checklist completion rate (Target: 100%)
- Pre-commit check pass rate (Target: > 95%)

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Checklist is too long, takes too much time**
A: Focus on sections relevant to your changes. Not every item applies to every PR.

**Q: Found a pattern not documented here**
A: Great! Document it in coderabbit-learnings.md or open an issue to add it.

**Q: CodeRabbit still commenting despite following checklist**
A: Skill evolves with project. Update references based on new feedback.

**Q: How do I know which reference to read?**
A: Start with pre-pr-checklist.md - it links to detailed guides as needed.

---

## Future Enhancements (Phase 3)

Planned automation:

- `extract_feedback.py` - Parse CodeRabbit comments from PRs
- Semi-automated skill updates from PR feedback
- CI/CD integration for pre-commit validation
- Metrics dashboard tracking improvement
- Auto-generate monthly learning summaries

**Status:** Designed in Phase 2, implementation pending
