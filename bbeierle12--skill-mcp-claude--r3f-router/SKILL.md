# R3F Router

Routes to 5 specialized React Three Fiber skills based on task requirements.

## Routing Protocol

1. **Classify** — Identify primary task type from user request
2. **Match** — Find skill(s) with highest signal match
3. **Combine** — Most R3F tasks need 2-4 skills together
4. **Load** — Read matched SKILL.md files before implementation

## Quick Route

### Tier 1: Core (Always Consider)

| Task Type | Skill | Primary Signal Words |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Scene setup | `r3f-fundamentals` | canvas, scene, camera, lights, render, useFrame |
| Custom shapes | `r3f-geometry` | geometry, vertices, bufferAttribute, instancing, mesh |
| Surface appearance | `r3f-materials` | material, shader, texture, uniform, color, PBR |

### Tier 2: Enhanced (Add When Needed)

| Task Type | Skill | Primary Signal Words |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Optimization | `r3f-performance` | performance, FPS, draw calls, LOD, culling, memory |
| Helpers/Controls | `r3f-drei` | OrbitControls, useGLTF, Text, Environment, Html |

## Signal Matching Rules

### Priority Order

When multiple signals present, resolve by priority:

1. **Explicit component** — "add OrbitControls" → `r3f-drei`
2. **Specific technique** — "use instancing" → `r3f-geometry`
3. **Problem domain** — "custom shader" → `r3f-materials`
4. **Default tier** — Fall back to `r3f-fundamentals`

### Confidence Scoring

- **High (3+ signals)** — Route immediately
- **Medium (1-2 signals)** — Route with `r3f-fundamentals` as base
- **Low (0 signals)** — Ask user for clarification

## Common Combinations

### Basic 3D Scene (3 skills)

```
r3f-fundamentals → Canvas, camera, lights, render loop
r3f-drei         → OrbitControls, Environment, helpers
r3f-materials    → MeshStandardMaterial, textures
```

Wiring: Fundamentals provides scene structure, drei adds controls and environment, materials define appearance.

### Custom Shader Effect (3 skills)

```
r3f-fundamentals → Scene setup, useFrame for animation
r3f-geometry     → Custom BufferGeometry if needed
r3f-materials    → ShaderMaterial, uniforms, GLSL
```

Wiring: Fundamentals handles render loop, materials provides shader infrastructure.

### Particle System (4 skills)

```
r3f-fundamentals → Scene, camera, render loop
r3f-geometry     → InstancedMesh, buffer attributes
r3f-materials    → Custom particle shader
r3f-performance  → Optimization, draw call reduction
```

Wiring: Geometry provides instancing, materials handles particle rendering, performance ensures smooth animation.

### Product Visualization (4 skills)

```
r3f-fundamentals → Scene structure
r3f-drei         → useGLTF, Environment, ContactShadows, OrbitControls
r3f-materials    → PBR materials, environment mapping
r3f-performance  → LOD, texture optimization
```

Wiring: Drei loads model and provides studio setup, materials ensures realistic rendering.

### Large Scene (4 skills)

```
r3f-fundamentals → Base scene management
r3f-geometry     → Merged geometry, instancing
r3f-performance  → LOD, culling, lazy loading
r3f-drei         → Bounds, Preload, Detailed
```

Wiring: Performance strategies combined with geometry optimization for smooth rendering.

## Decision Table

| Scenario | Model Loading | Custom Shapes | Custom Shaders | Optimization | Route To |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Simple viewer | Yes | No | No | No | fundamentals + drei |
| Custom geometry | No | Yes | No | No | fundamentals + geometry |
| Shader art | No | Maybe | Yes | No | fundamentals + materials + geometry |
| Game/simulation | Maybe | Yes | Maybe | Yes | all skills |
| Product viz | Yes | No | No | Maybe | fundamentals + drei + materials |
| Particles | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | fundamentals + geometry + materials + performance |

## Skill Dependencies

```
r3f-fundamentals (foundation)
├── r3f-geometry (extends fundamentals)
├── r3f-materials (extends fundamentals)
├── r3f-drei (extends fundamentals)
└── r3f-performance (applies to all)
```

- Always start with `r3f-fundamentals`
- `r3f-geometry` and `r3f-materials` often used together
- `r3f-drei` can replace manual implementations
- `r3f-performance` applies optimization to any combination

## Fallback Behavior

- **Unknown task type** → Start with `r3f-fundamentals` + `r3f-drei`
- **No clear signals** → Ask: "What are you trying to render?" and "Any specific effects needed?"
- **Conflicting signals** → Prefer `r3f-drei` abstractions over manual implementations
