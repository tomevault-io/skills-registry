## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure:
- Security scan data or logs are available in {baseDir}/security/
- Access to application configuration files
- Security tool outputs (e.g., vulnerability scanners, SAST/DAST results)
- Compliance framework documentation (if applicable)
- Write permissions for generating report files

## Instructions

### 1. Data Collection Phase

Gather security information from available sources:
- Read vulnerability scan results
- Analyze security configurations
- Review access control policies
- Check encryption implementations
- Examine authentication mechanisms

### 2. Analysis Phase

Process collected data to identify:
- Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS scores, exploitability)
- Security misconfigurations
- Compliance gaps against standards (PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)
- Access control weaknesses
- Data protection issues

### 3. Report Generation Phase

Create structured audit report with:
- Executive summary with risk overview
- Detailed vulnerability findings with severity ratings
- Compliance status matrix
- Risk assessment and prioritization
- Remediation recommendations with timelines
- Technical appendices with evidence

### 4. Output Formatting

Generate report in requested format:
- Markdown for version control
- HTML for stakeholder review
- JSON for integration with ticketing systems
- PDF-ready structure for formal documentation

## Output

The skill produces:

**Primary Output**: Comprehensive security audit report saved to {baseDir}/reports/security-audit-YYYYMMDD.md

**Report Structure**:
```
# Security Audit Report - [System Name]
## Executive Summary
- Overall risk rating
- Critical findings count
- Compliance status

## Vulnerability Findings
### Critical (CVSS 9.0+)
- [CVE-XXXX-XXXX] Description
- Impact assessment
- Remediation steps

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
[Similar structure]

## Compliance Assessment
- PCI-DSS: 85% compliant (gaps identified)
- GDPR: 92% compliant
- SOC 2: In progress

## Remediation Plan
Priority matrix with timelines

## Technical Appendices
Evidence and scan outputs
```

**Secondary Outputs**:
- Vulnerability tracking JSON for issue systems
- Executive summary slide deck outline
- Remediation tracking checklist

## Error Handling

**Common Issues and Resolutions**:

1. **Missing Scan Data**
   - Error: "No security scan results found"
   - Resolution: Specify alternate data sources or run preliminary scans
   - Fallback: Generate report from configuration analysis only

2. **Incomplete Compliance Framework**
   - Error: "Cannot assess [STANDARD] compliance - requirements unavailable"
   - Resolution: Request framework checklist or use general best practices
   - Fallback: Note limitation in report with partial assessment

3. **Access Denied to Configuration Files**
   - Error: "Permission denied reading {baseDir}/config/"
   - Resolution: Request elevated permissions or provide configuration exports
   - Fallback: Generate report with available data, note gaps

4. **Large Dataset Processing**
   - Error: "Scan results exceed processing capacity"
   - Resolution: Process in batches by severity or component
   - Fallback: Focus on critical/high findings first

**Report Templates**:
- Use {baseDir}/templates/security-audit-template.md if available
- Default structure follows NIST SP 800-115 guidelines

**Integration Points**:
- Export findings to JIRA/GitHub Issues for tracking
- Generate compliance evidence for SOC 2 audits
- Link to SIEM/logging systems for evidence validation
