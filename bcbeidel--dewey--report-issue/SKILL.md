<objective>
Lets plugin users submit feedback to the Dewey GitHub repository without needing to know the repo URL or issue template structure. Claude gathers freeform input, classifies it, drafts a GitHub issue, shows a preview, and submits via `gh`.
</objective>

<quick_start>
Invoke `/dewey:report-issue` or say "I want to report a bug in Dewey". Claude gathers your feedback, classifies it, drafts a GitHub issue, shows you a preview, and submits after your approval.

Prerequisites: `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).
</quick_start>

<context>
<approach>
1. **Gather** -- The user describes what's on their mind in natural language.
2. **Classify** -- Claude determines whether it's a bug, enhancement, or general feedback.
3. **Draft** -- Claude composes a structured GitHub issue body.
4. **Confirm** -- The user reviews and approves before anything is posted.
5. **Submit** -- `gh issue create` posts to the Dewey repo.
</approach>

<philosophy>
- **Freeform intake** -- The user says what they want. Claude extracts structure.
- **User controls content** -- No automatic capture of conversation history or environment details. The user sees and approves everything before submission.
- **One command, one outcome** -- A GitHub issue on `bcbeidel/dewey`.
</philosophy>

<variables>
- `$ARGUMENTS` -- Optional free-text feedback passed directly to the skill
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` -- Root directory of the Dewey plugin
</variables>
</context>

<intake>
This skill activates on `/dewey:report-issue` or when the user expresses feedback intent: "report a bug in dewey", "I have feedback about the plugin", "something isn't working in dewey", "I'd like to suggest a feature for dewey", or similar phrases.

<gather_feedback>
If `$ARGUMENTS` contains substantive feedback, use it directly. Do not re-ask.

If invoked with no arguments and no prior conversational context, ask one open-ended question:

> "What feedback do you have about Dewey? This could be a bug report, a feature idea, or anything else on your mind."
</gather_feedback>

<route>
All feedback routes to the same workflow. There is only one.

Route to `workflows/report-issue-submit.md`.
</route>
</intake>

<workflows_index>
All workflows in `workflows/`:

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| report-issue-submit.md | Gather feedback, classify, draft GitHub issue, confirm with user, submit |
</workflows_index>

<success_criteria>
Feedback submission is successful when:

- The user's feedback is captured accurately in the issue body
- The issue is classified with the correct label (bug or enhancement)
- The user reviewed and approved the issue before submission
- The issue was created on `bcbeidel/dewey` and the URL was shown to the user
</success_criteria>
