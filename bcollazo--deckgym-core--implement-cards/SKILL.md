# Implementing Cards

To implement cards, first read the `models` module and the `state` module. Cards
are not implemented if they are a Pokemon that is missing an Ability or Attack implementation,
or a Trainer card (be it a tool or a normal one) missig implementation.

If the user hasn't specified what card to implement, you can use the tool:

```bash
cargo run --bin card_status
```

to see what cards are missing, and choose one. You can also that tool
to see what is missing from the specified card.

## Abilities

- Get the details of all the cards that have the ability you want to implement by using the following script:
  - For a single card or name lookup:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin search "Venusaur"
  ```

- Copy the ids of cards to implement (including full art versions) in the given JSON. Only choose the ones with the ability you want to implement.
- All abilities should use the `AbilityMechanic` pathway.
  - Find the ability effect text in the JSON and search for it in `effect_ability_mechanic_map.rs`.
  - Re-use an existing `AbilityMechanic` when possible. If not, add a new variant in `src/actions/abilities/mechanic.rs`.
  - Add or uncomment all matching `map.insert(...)` lines in `effect_ability_mechanic_map.rs` and map them to the correct `AbilityMechanic` with parameters.
  - Implement the mechanic logic in `forecast_ability_by_mechanic` in `src/actions/apply_abilities_action.rs`.
    - Return an `Outcomes` struct (see `src/actions/outcomes.rs`).
    - For deterministic effects: `Outcomes::single_fn(|rng, state, action| { ... })`
    - For coin-flip effects, use the appropriate `Outcomes` constructor:
      - `Outcomes::binary_coin(heads_mutation, tails_mutation)` for a single coin flip
      - `Outcomes::binomial_by_heads(n, |heads| mutation)` for N flips grouped by heads count
      - `Outcomes::geometric_until_tails(max, |heads| mutation)` for flip-until-tails effects
    - Keep `match` arms as one-liners by moving logic into helpers.
  - Implement move generation logic in `can_use_ability_by_mechanic` in `src/move_generation/move_generation_abilities.rs`.
    - Keep `match` arms as one-liners by moving logic into helpers.
- If the ability is passive or hook-driven:
  - Prefer a mechanic + hook combination.
  - Put the mechanic-to-hook wiring in the relevant hook file, usually under `src/hooks/`.
  - `forecast_ability_by_mechanic` should `panic!` for passive mechanics, and `can_use_ability_by_mechanic` should return `false`.
- Add a logic test at the `Game` public API level.
  - Prefer the folder-matched integration test layout under `tests/`, for example `tests/pokemon/...`, `tests/tools/...`, `tests/stadiums/...`, or `tests/mechanics/...`.
  - Follow existing tests like `tests/tools/raikou_rocky_helmet_order_test.rs` in style and abstraction level.
  - Do not assert on `.move_generation_stack`; drive behavior through public actions and resulting game state.

## Attack

- Get the details of the card with the attack you want to implement by using the following script:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin search "Venusaur" --attack "Giant Bloom"
  ```

- Search for the effect text in the above JSON in the `effect_mechanic_map.rs` file.
- Decide if we should introduce a new Mechanic or re-use or generalize an existing one. Try to re-use existing ones first.
- Identify all the cards that have the same effect text template, and just differ by parameters.
- Uncomment all the `// map.insert("` lines that pertain to the mechanic, and add the correct value (an `Mechanic` enum variant with the corresponding parameters).
- Implement the mechanic logic in `forecast_effect_attack_by_mechanic` in `src/actions/apply_attack_action.rs`.
  - Return an `Outcomes` struct (see `src/actions/outcomes.rs`).
  - For deterministic effects: `Outcomes::single_fn(|rng, state, action| { ... })`
  - For coin-flip effects, use the appropriate `Outcomes` constructor:
    - `Outcomes::binary_coin(heads_mutation, tails_mutation)` - single coin flip
    - `Outcomes::binomial_by_heads(n, |heads| mutation)` - flip N coins, group by heads count
    - `Outcomes::geometric_until_tails(max, |heads| mutation)` - flip until tails
  - Keep the code as a simple one-liner in the match statement by using helper functions
  - Review similar attacks in `src/actions/apply_attack_action.rs` to ensure consistency in implementation.
- Add a Game-level logic test in the matching `tests/` subfolder when the attack has non-trivial behavior.

## Tool

- Get the details of the tool card that you want to implement by using the following script:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin search "Leaf Cape"
  ```

- Copy the ids of cards to implement (including full art versions) in the given JSON.
- In `tools.rs`:
- In `src/tools.rs`:
  - Add a `static EFFECT_NAME_EFFECT: LazyLock<String>` constant using `tool_effect_text_from_card_id(CardId::...)`.
  - Add the effect to `is_tool_effect_implemented()` match expression.
  - If the tool has attachment restrictions (e.g., only Grass pokemon), add a check in `can_attach_tool_to()`.
- Implement any immediate effects in the tool's core logic rather than a dedicated "on attach" hook.
  - For HP modifiers, prefer dynamic calculation in `PlayedCard::get_effective_total_hp()`.
  - For other immediate effects, add a focused helper in the relevant hook file and call it from the appropriate action handler.
- Ensure Tool is correctly handled by `forecast_trainer_action`.
- For tools with ongoing effects (not just on-attach):
  - Implement hooks in `hooks/core.rs` or other appropriate hook files.
  - Use `has_tool(played_card, CardId::...)` to check if a pokemon has a specific tool attached.
  - Examples: Rocky Helmet deals damage when the holder is attacked.
- Add a Game-level integration test under `tests/tools/` for the observable effect.

## Trainer Cards

- Get the details of the trainer card that you want to implement by using the following script:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin search "Rare Candy"
  ```

- Copy the ids of cards to implement (including full art versions) in the given JSON.
- Implement the "move generation" logic.
  - In `move_generation_trainer.rs` implement the switch branch. Its often the case the Trainer/Support can always be played, so just add to this case in the switch.
- Implement the "apply action" logic.
  - This is the code that actually runs when the card is played.
  - Visit `src/actions/apply_trainer_action.rs`.
  - Return an `Outcomes` struct (see `src/actions/outcomes.rs`):
    - For deterministic effects: `Outcomes::single_fn(|rng, state, action| { ... })`
    - For coin-flip effects, use `Outcomes::binary_coin(...)` or other coin constructors
  - Often its just "applying an effect" in the field (like Leaf).
    - If the turn is something that affects all pokemon in play for a given turn use
      the `.turn_effects` field in the state. You can use to for effects that apply to
      this turn, or a future one.
    - Some cards might be fairly unique and might need architectural changes to the engine. For cards with considerable custom logic,
      try to find a generalizing pattern that can be presented as a "hook" in the `hooks.rs`. The idea of `hooks.rs` is to try to encapsulate
      most custom logic that goes outside of the normal business logic. Also consider adding new
      pieces of state to the `State` struct if necessary.

  - Try to keep the `match trainer_id` cases as one-liners (using helper functions if necessary).
- Add a Game-level integration test in the appropriate `tests/` area if the trainer has logic beyond a trivial draw/search path.

## Stadium

- Get the details of the stadium card that you want to implement by using the following script:

  ```bash
  cargo run --bin search "Peculiar Plaza"
  ```

- Copy the ids of cards to implement (including full art versions) in the given JSON.
- In `src/stadiums.rs`:
  - Add a static `LazyLock<String>` constant for the stadium's effect text.
  - Add the stadium to `is_stadium_effect_implemented()`.
  - Add a helper function to query the stadium's effect (e.g., `get_peculiar_plaza_retreat_reduction`).
- Add Stadium move generation:
  - Move generation is already handled generically in `move_generation_trainer.rs` via `can_play_stadium()`.
  - No per-stadium logic needed unless the stadium has unique play conditions.
- Hook the stadium effect into the appropriate game mechanic:
  - Retreat cost effects: `hooks/retreat.rs` in `get_retreat_cost()`
  - Damage bonuses: `hooks/core.rs` in `modify_damage()`
  - HP bonuses: May need to modify `get_effective_total_hp()` or damage calculation
- Stadium effects apply to BOTH players equally.
- Test using `cargo run --bin card_test -- "CardId"`.
- Add a Game-level integration test under `tests/stadiums/`.

## Appendix

### Testing Your Implementation

After implementing a card, test it like so:

Run the integrated card test command (it generates a temp deck and runs 10,000 random games against all decks in `example_decks/`):

```bash
cargo run --bin card_test -- "Card ID"
```

Review the results to ensure the games complete without errors.

Run the targeted automated checks for the code you touched:

```bash
cargo test --features test-utils --test pokemon
cargo test --features test-utils --test tools
cargo test --features test-utils --test stadiums
cargo test --features test-utils --test mechanics
```

Pick the relevant test target(s) for your change rather than always running all four.

### Code Quality

Make sure to run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`. Also run the relevant targeted tests for the area you changed.
