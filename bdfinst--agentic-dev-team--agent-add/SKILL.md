# Agent Add

Role: implementation.

## Implementation constraints

1. Follow the official sub-agent schema and token budgets.
2. Delegate the build to the agent-create skill; do not improvise structure.
3. **Be concise.** Report the created agent file, no narration.

## Steps

### 1. Parse arguments

Capture the agent name/spec or URL from `$ARGUMENTS`.

### 2. Delegate

Invoke the agent-create skill with the arguments.

### 3. Report

Output the created file path.

Apply the guidelines defined in skills/agent-create/SKILL.md to the current
task. Read the skill file and follow its steps exactly.

If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `http://` or `https://`, fetch the URL with
WebFetch first and extract the relevant guidance, then use that content as
the agent description.

Pass these flags through to the skill as context:

- `--name <name>` → set agent name (skips name prompt)
- `--type review|team` → set agent type (skips type prompt)
- `--tier small|mid|frontier` → maps to model: small→haiku, mid→sonnet, frontier→opus
- `--context diff-only|full-file|project-structure` → sets `Context needs:` field
- `--lang <exts>` → adds language scope declaration to the body
- `--dry` → show generated content without writing to disk or updating registry

Apply this skill to: $ARGUMENTS
