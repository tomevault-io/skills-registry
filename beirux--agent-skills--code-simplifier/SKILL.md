# Code Simplifier

Automated code refactoring that reduces lines while maintaining identical functionality.
Focus on *deleting* code, not writing more.

## Workflow

### 1. Scope Discovery

Determine what to refactor:

- **User specifies files/dirs**: Use those directly.
- **"Recent changes"**: `git diff --name-only HEAD~3`
- **"Scan codebase" or broad request**: Glob for source files, prioritize largest files.
- **No scope given**: Default to `git diff --name-only HEAD~5`.

Skip: `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `vendor/`, lockfiles, generated files, test files (unless explicitly asked).

### 2. Analysis Pass

Read each file fully. Evaluate against these smell categories:

| Category | What to Look For |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Loop bloat** | `for` loops → `map/filter/reduce/find/some/every/flatMap` |
| **Conditional complexity** | Nested ifs, missing guard clauses, missing `?.` / `??` / `??=` |
| **Dead code** | Unused vars, unreachable branches, redundant returns, unused imports |
| **Duplication** | Repeated logic (3+ lines appearing 2+ times in same file) |
| **Verbose idioms** | Missing destructuring, spread, template literals, modern APIs |
| **Boolean bloat** | `if (x) return true; else return false;`, double negation, De Morgan |
| **Function bloat** | Unnecessary wrappers, missing implicit returns, unnecessary IIFEs |
| **React smells** | Unnecessary fragments, derived state in useState, inline handler duplication |

### 3. Scoring

Rate each file (1-10, lower = better):

| Metric | Measures |
|--------|----------|
| **Complexity** | Branch paths: `if`, `else`, `case`, `&&`, `||`, `?:`, `catch` |
| **Length** | Average function length in lines |
| **Working Memory** | Max simultaneous variables in any function scope |
| **Duplication** | Repeated logic blocks across the file |

### 4. Review-First Output

Present findings as a structured report per file:

```
## File: path/to/file.js

### Metrics
| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Complexity | 6/10 | processOrder() has 12 branches |
| Length | 4/10 | Avg 18 lines/function |
| Working Memory | 7/10 | handleSubmit() juggles 8 vars |
| Duplication | 5/10 | Error handling repeated 3x |

### Proposed Changes (N changes, ~M lines saved)

#### 1. [SAFE] Loop → array method (lines 24-31)
**Before** (8 lines):
```js
// current code
```
**After** (2 lines):
```js
// refactored code
```
Lines saved: 6 | Risk: Safe
```

Tag every change:
- **[SAFE]** — Mechanical transformation, zero behavior change
- **[CAUTION]** — Likely safe but verify (truthiness semantics, evaluation order, side effects)

### 5. Apply Changes

After user approves:
- Apply via Edit tool, one change at a time, largest savings first
- Re-read file after all edits to verify no syntax breakage
- Note if user should run their linter/formatter

## Rules

1. **Never change behavior.** Any ambiguity → mark [CAUTION] and explain the edge case.
2. **Never add code.** Only exception: extracting a helper to DRY 3+ duplications (net lines must still decrease).
3. **Never add comments, docstrings, or type annotations** unless explicitly requested.
4. **Preserve formatting style.** Match existing indentation, quotes, semicolons.
5. **One file at a time.** Complete analysis + review before moving to next file.
6. **Respect the user's stack.** Maintain React conventions in JSX. Don't convert class → functional unless asked.

## Quick Mode

If user says "just fix it" or "auto-apply": skip review table, apply all [SAFE] changes directly. Still present [CAUTION] changes for review.
