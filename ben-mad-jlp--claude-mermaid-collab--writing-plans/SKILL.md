# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** This can be run in the current working directory or a dedicated worktree.

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Design Artifacts:** 
- Designs: [list mermaid-collab diagram IDs or "N/A"]
- Architecture diagrams: [list IDs or "N/A"]
- Design doc: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

```

## Task Structure

```markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Changes (pseudo code):**
- `file.py`: Create class Foo with method bar() that takes input X and returns Y
- `existing.py:123-145`: Add validation check before process() call, raise ValueError if invalid

**Design Reference:**
- Design: `mermaid-collab/diagrams/<design-id>` (if applicable)
- Design Doc: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` section X

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
```

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Design Alignment Verification

**Every task MUST be traceable to the design:**
- Reference the specific section of the design doc that this task implements
- If mermaid-collab designs/diagrams exist, reference them by ID
- Verification steps must check against design, not just "does code work"

**For UI tasks:**
- Reference the design diagram ID
- Verification: "Compare implementation to design `<id>` — all elements present and positioned correctly"

**For architecture tasks:**
- Reference the architecture/flow diagram ID
- Verification: "Confirm data flow matches diagram `<id>`"

**If design artifacts don't exist but should:**
- Stop and create them in mermaid-collab before writing the task

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer execution choice:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:**

**1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** - I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration

**2. Parallel Session (separate)** - Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints

**Which approach?"**

**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use mermaid-collab:subagent-driven-development:implementer-prompt
- Stay in this session
- Fresh subagent per task + code review

**If Parallel Session chosen:**
- Guide them to open new session in worktree
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** New session uses superpowers:executing-plans
