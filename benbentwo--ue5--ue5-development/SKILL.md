# UE5 Server Mode

The UE5 CLI includes a Server Mode that runs a background daemon to manage Unreal Editor instances. The daemon captures all editor output (stdout/stderr), tracks process lifecycle, coordinates AI-driven rebuilds with coalescing, and provides both a JSON API and MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI agent integration.

## Architecture

```
AI Agent ──► MCP SSE ──► Daemon Process
              :9515       │
AI Agent ──► ue5 CLI ──► Unix Socket
                          ~/.ue5/         ├─ Instance Manager
                          server.sock     │    ├─ Project A (PID, state, logs)
                                          │    └─ Project B (PID, state, logs)
                                          ├─ State Store
                                          │    └─ ~/.ue5/state.json
                                          ├─ Agent Registry
                                          │    └─ Tracks registered AI sessions
                                          ├─ Build Orchestrator
                                          │    └─ Coalescing queue
                                          └─ MCP SSE Server (:9515)
                                               └─ Push notifications
```

- **Dual protocol**: Unix socket (CLI) + MCP SSE (AI agents)
- **Multi-project**: Tracks multiple editor instances by project path
- **Multi-agent**: Multiple AI agents work concurrently with coalesced rebuilds
- **Auto-start**: Daemon starts automatically when needed

## Core Commands

### Daemon Management
```bash
ue5 server start          # Start daemon (or auto-starts with other commands)
ue5 server start -f       # Run in foreground (for debugging)
ue5 server stop           # Stop daemon and all editors
ue5 server status         # Human-readable status
ue5 server status --json  # Machine-readable JSON status
```

### Editor Lifecycle
```bash
ue5 server run --wait --timeout 120s --json  # Start editor and wait for running state
ue5 server run            # Start editor without waiting
ue5 server run -p /path/to/Project.uproject  # Specify project explicitly
ue5 server kill           # Stop editor for current project (SIGTERM)
ue5 server kill --force   # Force stop (SIGKILL)
ue5 server kill --all     # Stop all managed editors
```

### AI-Driven Rebuilds
```bash
ue5 server rebuild --label "Added inventory system" --mode full
ue5 server rebuild --label "Fixed health component" --mode hot_reload
ue5 server rebuild --label "Updated AI behavior" --mode full --agent my-agent-id
```

Build modes:
- **`full`**: Stop editor → build → restart editor. Use when C++ headers changed or major refactoring.
- **`hot_reload`**: Build in background while editor stays running. Use for .cpp-only changes.

### Build Metadata
```bash
ue5 server build-info         # Current build metadata + accumulated features
ue5 server build-info --json  # Machine-readable
```

### Agent Management
```bash
ue5 server agents         # List registered AI agents
ue5 server agents --json  # Machine-readable
```

### Log Querying
```bash
ue5 server logs                             # Last 100 lines
ue5 server logs -n 50                       # Last 50 lines
ue5 server logs --level error               # Only errors
ue5 server logs --level warning             # Only warnings
ue5 server logs --category LogCompile       # Filter by UE log category
ue5 server logs --pattern "MyActor"         # Regex filter
ue5 server logs --since 5m                  # Last 5 minutes
ue5 server logs --json                      # JSON output
ue5 server logs -f                          # Stream (tail -f style)
ue5 server logs -f --level error            # Stream errors only
```

## MCP Integration

The daemon exposes an MCP SSE server on port `9515` (configurable via `UE5_MCP_PORT` env var). AI agents connect to receive push notifications about editor state changes and build events.

### MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rebuild` | Trigger rebuild (full or hot_reload) with label |
| `register_agent` | Register AI agent as consumer |
| `unregister_agent` | Unregister agent |
| `get_build_info` | Query build metadata and feature history |

### MCP Resources

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `ue5://build/current` | Current build metadata + accumulated features |
| `ue5://agents` | Registered agents list |
| `ue5://instances` | Editor instance states |

### MCP Notifications (push to ALL connected agents)

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `editor_state_changed` | Instance transitions (running→stopped, etc.) |
| `rebuild_started` | Build orchestrator begins build |
| `rebuild_complete` | Build finishes (success or failure) |
| `agent_registered` | New agent registers |
| `agent_unregistered` | Agent leaves |

## Multi-Agent Coordination

Multiple AI agents can work on the same codebase simultaneously. Key concepts:

### Build Coalescing
When multiple agents request rebuilds concurrently, requests are **coalesced** into a single UBT build:
- Agent A requests rebuild with label "inventory system"
- Agent B requests rebuild with label "health component" (while A's build runs)
- Result: one build that includes both changes, both agents notified

### Mode Escalation
If any agent requests `full` mode, the coalesced build uses `full` mode (most restrictive wins).

### Feature Accumulation
Each build accumulates features from all previous builds. Query `accumulated_features` to see exactly what's in the current running binary:
```bash
ue5 server build-info --json | jq '.accumulated_features'
```

### Agent Registration
Agents register once to inform the daemon how many consumers exist. All registered agents receive MCP notifications when builds complete or the editor restarts.

## AI Debugging Workflow

### 1. Register as an agent (once per session)
Via MCP `register_agent` tool or CLI.

### 2. Check current build state
```bash
ue5 server build-info --json
```

### 3. After making code changes, trigger a rebuild
```bash
ue5 server rebuild --label "Fixed null pointer in PlayerController" --mode full
```

### 4. Query errors from the new build
```bash
ue5 server logs --level error --since 2m --json
```

### 5. Search for specific patterns
```bash
ue5 server logs --pattern "NullPtr|nullptr|Access violation" --lines 200
```

### 6. Verify the fix
```bash
ue5 server logs --level error --since 1m
```

## Build Record Format

```json
{
  "id": "build-1234567890",
  "project_path": "/path/to/MyGame.uproject",
  "labels": ["Added inventory system", "Fixed health component"],
  "features": ["Login system", "Combat system", "Added inventory system", "Fixed health component"],
  "contributions": [
    {"agent_id": "agent-A", "label": "Added inventory system"},
    {"agent_id": "agent-B", "label": "Fixed health component"}
  ],
  "mode": "full",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "started_at": "2026-02-15T10:00:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2026-02-15T10:03:00Z",
  "target": "MyGameEditor",
  "platform": "Mac",
  "configuration": "Development"
}
```

## Instance States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `starting` | Process launched, waiting for initialization |
| `running` | Editor is active |
| `stopping` | SIGTERM sent, waiting for graceful exit |
| `stopped` | Exited cleanly (exit code 0) |
| `crashed` | Exited with non-zero exit code |

## Log File Location

Logs are stored at `~/.ue5/logs/<project-hash>/editor.log` with the format:
```
2026-02-15T10:00:00.123Z stdout | LogInit: Display: Initializing engine
2026-02-15T10:00:00.456Z stderr | LogCore:Warning: Some warning here
```

Build logs are stored at `~/.ue5/logs/<project-hash>/build.log`.

## Key Differences from Raw Shell Commands

| Before (raw commands) | After (server mode) |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| `pkill UnrealEditor` (kills ALL instances) | `ue5 server kill` (kills only current project) |
| `ue5 server kill && ue5 build && ue5 server run` | `ue5 server rebuild --label "..." --mode full` |
| `tail -f Saved/Logs/*.log` | `ue5 server logs -f` (captured from process stdout) |
| `grep Error Saved/Logs/*.log` | `ue5 server logs --level error` (parsed and filtered) |
| No process tracking | `ue5 server status --json` (full lifecycle tracking) |
| Logs lost on crash | Logs captured to persistent file |
| No build metadata | `ue5 server build-info` (features, history, status) |
| Manual multi-agent coordination | Automatic coalescing + MCP notifications |
