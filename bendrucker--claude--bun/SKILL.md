# Bun

## bunx

Use `--bun` before the executable name to force the Bun runtime over Node shebangs. Use `-p`/`--package` when the binary name differs from the package name (e.g., `bunx -p @angular/cli ng`).

See [references/bunx.md](references/bunx.md)

## Lockfile

`bun.lock` is a text-based lockfile. Resolve merge conflicts by deleting it and running `bun install` to regenerate from scratch — never attempt to merge lockfile contents.

See [references/lockfile.md](references/lockfile.md)

## Resolution

Runtime flags must precede the script path: `bun --cwd ./packages/app run dev`. Never use `.js` extensions in TypeScript imports — Bun resolves them natively.

See [references/resolution.md](references/resolution.md)

## Shell

`Bun.$` is a tagged template for shell execution. Use response methods (`.text()`, `.json()`, `.lines()`) to extract output, `.nothrow()` to handle failures without exceptions, and pipe/redirect syntax for composing commands.

See [references/shell.md](references/shell.md)

## Subprocess

`Bun.spawn` spawns subprocesses with streaming I/O. Use `Bun.spawnSync` for synchronous execution. Configure stdin/stdout/stderr, environment variables, and working directory. Check `exitCode` for error handling.

See [references/spawn.md](references/spawn.md)

## File I/O

`Bun.file()` creates file handles with `.text()`, `.json()`, `.arrayBuffer()`, and `.stream()` methods. `Bun.write()` writes content to files or stdout/stderr. Both support streaming for large files.

See [references/file-io.md](references/file-io.md)

## Testing

Bun runs tests in a single process. Use `describe`/`it`/`test` for structure, `expect` matchers for assertions, lifecycle hooks (`beforeEach`, `afterEach`) for setup/teardown, `mock()` for function mocking, and `.toMatchSnapshot()` for snapshot testing. Set `AGENT=1` to suppress passing test output.

See [references/testing.md](references/testing.md)
