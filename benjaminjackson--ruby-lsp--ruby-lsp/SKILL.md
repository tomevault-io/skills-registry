# Ruby LSP Usage Guidance

This project has Ruby LSP (shopify/ruby-lsp) integration enabled. Use the LSP tool proactively for Ruby code intelligence.

## CRITICAL: Check This Decision Tree FIRST

**BEFORE Reading Any Ruby File**, determine what information is needed:

**Need file structure overview?** → **documentSymbol** ✅
**Need to know what methods exist?** → **documentSymbol** ✅
**Need method signatures?** → **documentSymbol + Read** ✅ (NOT hover - doesn't work on definitions)
**Need to understand class/module structure?** → **documentSymbol** ✅
**Need to see where a method is defined?** → **goToDefinition** ✅ (from call site)
**Need to see where a method is used?** → **findReferences** ✅ (very detailed)
**Need quick signature from call site?** → **hover** ✅ (works on calls, not definitions)
**Need implementation details?** → **Read** ✅
**Need to search across project?** → **Grep** ✅ (workspaceSymbol doesn't work)

**Key Rule:** documentSymbol for structure, Read for content, LSP for navigation.

## Quick Reference

| What You Need | Use This | NOT This |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| File structure overview | documentSymbol | Read entire file |
| Method signature | documentSymbol + Read | hover on definition (doesn't work) |
| Where method is defined | goToDefinition | Grep for "def method" |
| Where method is used | findReferences | Grep for method name |
| Cross-project search | Grep | workspaceSymbol (broken) |
| Quick signature from call | hover on call site | Navigate away |
| Implementation details | Read | documentSymbol (only gives structure) |

## Common Workflows

### Getting Method Signatures (The Right Way)

CRITICAL: Ruby LSP cannot extract signatures from method definitions.

❌ **BROKEN - Hover on definitions (this will never work):**
```
Step 1: documentSymbol → get "initialize" at line 41
Step 2: hover at line 41 → Returns "No hover information available"
Why: Hover does NOT support Prism::DefNode (method definitions)
```

✅ **CORRECT - documentSymbol + Read:**
```
Step 1: documentSymbol on file.rb → get method list:
  - process_payment at line 145
  - validate_card at line 167
  - charge_card at line 189

Step 2: Read file.rb offset=144 limit=5 → see actual def:
  def process_payment(amount, currency = 'USD', metadata = {})
    validate_card(metadata[:card])
    charge_card(amount, currency)
  end

Result: Full signature without reading entire file
```

✅ **ALTERNATIVE - Hover on call site (if you have one):**
```
Context: You see `processor.process_payment(100, 'EUR')` at line 89
Step 1: hover at that call site (on "process_payment")
Result: Shows signature from definition: process_payment(amount, currency = 'USD', metadata = {})
Limitation: Requires finding a call site first
```

### Why Hover Doesn't Work on Definitions

Ruby LSP's ALLOWED_TARGETS:
- ✅ Prism::CallNode (method calls)
- ✅ Prism::ConstantReadNode (constants)
- ❌ Prism::DefNode (method definitions) ← NOT SUPPORTED

This is by design. To get signatures from definitions, use documentSymbol + Read.

### Understanding File Structure

❌ **Wrong:**
```
Task: Understand what's in this Ruby file
Assistant: [Reads entire file and manually parses for classes/methods]
```

✅ **Correct:**
```
Task: Understand what's in this Ruby file
Step 1: documentSymbol → get hierarchical structure
Result:
  PaymentProcessor (Class) - Line 10
    initialize (Constructor) - Line 12
    process_payment (Method) - Line 145
    validate_card (Method) - Line 167

Step 2: Read specific methods if needed
```

### Finding Where Methods Are Called

❌ **Wrong:**
```
Task: Find all places where process_payment is called
Assistant: [Uses Grep to search for "process_payment" as text]
```

✅ **Correct:**
```
Task: Find all places where process_payment is called
Step 1: goToDefinition or documentSymbol → find method at line 145
Step 2: findReferences at line 145
Result: Found 12 references:
  app/controllers/payments_controller.rb:
    Line 23:15
    Line 67:11
  lib/billing/processor.rb:
    Line 89:27
  [... detailed, semantic matches]
```

## Detailed Operation Guide

### 1. documentSymbol - "What's in this file?" (PRIMARY TOOL)

**Use when you need:**
- List of all methods in a file
- Class and module structure
- Overview before diving deeper
- Method names with line numbers

**Returns:**
- Hierarchical structure of all symbols
- Method names (NOT full signatures - use Read for that)
- Line numbers for each symbol
- Classes, modules, methods, instance variables

**How to use:**
```
LSP operation="documentSymbol" filePath="/absolute/path/file.rb" line=1 character=1
```

**Note:** line/character parameters are required but don't affect results - you always get all symbols.

**Example:**
```
Context: User asks "What methods are available in payment_processor.rb?"

LSP operation="documentSymbol" filePath="/app/payment_processor.rb" line=1 character=1

Returns:
  PaymentProcessor (Class) - Line 10
    initialize (Constructor) - Line 12
    process_payment (Method) - Line 145
    validate_card (Method) - Line 167
    charge_card (Method) - Line 189
```

**Follow-up:** Use Read with offset/limit to see specific method signatures.

### 2. findReferences - "Where is this used?"

**Use when you need:**
- All places a method is called
- All uses of a class or constant
- Impact analysis before refactoring

**Returns:**
- Every location where symbol is referenced
- Very detailed output with file paths and line numbers
- Semantic matches (not string search)

**How to use:**
```
Context: Want to find all usages of log method at line 259
LSP operation="findReferences" filePath="/path/file.rb" line=259 character=7

Returns: Found 48 references across 3 files:
  lib/journeys/brief_writer.rb:
    Line 109:11
    Line 117:7
  scripts/generate_briefs.rb:
    Line 143:27
    Line 153:27
  [... comprehensive list]
```

**Example scenarios:**
```
Context: About to rename or refactor process_payment method
Step 1: documentSymbol or goToDefinition → find definition location
Step 2: findReferences at definition location
Result: All call sites across project for impact analysis
```

### 3. goToDefinition - "Where is this defined?"

**Use when you need:**
- Jump to where method/class is defined
- Find definition of inherited method
- Navigate from usage to definition

**Returns:**
- Exact file path and line number of definition
- Works with inheritance and mixins

**How to use:**
```
Context: Line 143 has `log(msg)` call, need to see implementation
LSP operation="goToDefinition" filePath="/path/file.rb" line=143 character=27

Returns: Defined in scripts/generate_briefs.rb:259:7
```

**Example scenarios:**
```
Context: Looking at code that calls User.authenticate, need to see how it's implemented
Step 1: goToDefinition on authenticate call site
Result: Jumps to exact definition, even if in parent class or mixin
```

**Don't use Grep** to search for "def method_name" - goToDefinition understands inheritance.

### 4. hover - "What does this call/constant do?" (LIMITED USE)

**CRITICAL:** Hover is a LIMITED tool in Ruby. It works on usage sites, not definitions.

**Works on:**
- ✅ Method calls: `user.save` → shows signature
- ✅ Constants: `PaymentProcessor` → shows class definition
- ✅ Variables: `@user`, `@@class_var`, `$global` → shows where defined
- ✅ Keywords: `super`, `yield`

**Does NOT work on:**
- ❌ Method definitions: `def save` → no response
- ❌ Local variables
- ❌ Method parameters
- ❌ Most other Ruby syntax

**When to use:**
Reading code and encounter a method call to something defined in another file. Hover gives you quick signature without navigating away.

**Example - The actual use case:**
```
Context: You're reading payment_processor.rb and see:
  validator.check_amount(amount)

You want to know check_amount's signature without navigating to validator.rb

LSP operation="hover" filePath="/app/payment_processor.rb" line=24 character=15

Returns:
  check_amount(amount, options = {})
  Definition: lib/validators/amount_validator.rb:45
  Documentation: [if any exists]
```

This is useful but narrow - not a primary workflow tool.

**When NOT to use:**
- Getting signatures from method definitions → Use documentSymbol + Read
- Primary code exploration → Use documentSymbol
- Understanding file structure → Use documentSymbol

**Why hover is secondary:**
- Requires being at a specific call site
- Doesn't work on definitions (the most common need)
- documentSymbol + Read is more direct for most use cases

## How to Use LSP Operations

LSP operations don't require line/character precision for most use cases:

**documentSymbol:**
- Call it on any Ruby file
- Returns all symbols with line numbers
- line/character parameters required but don't affect results
- Always returns complete symbol tree

**goToDefinition:**
- Use from a call site or reference
- Navigate to where symbol is defined
- Works semantically (understands inheritance)

**findReferences:**
- Use from a definition
- Get all usages across entire project
- Returns very detailed output

**hover:**
- Use when at a method call or constant reference
- Works on the usage site, not the definition
- Limited use cases - prefer documentSymbol + Read for getting signatures

## Available LSP Operations

Ruby LSP in Claude Code has 4 useful operations:

### 1. documentSymbol (PRIMARY - Always Reliable)
**Get all symbols in a document**
- Use when: Need to understand file structure (classes, modules, methods)
- Returns: Hierarchical symbol tree with line numbers
- Why use: Always works, provides structured view instantly
- ❌ Don't use Read + manual parsing for structure

### 2. findReferences (Extremely Useful)
**Find all references to a symbol**
- Use when: Need to see where methods/classes are used across project
- Returns: All locations where symbol is referenced (very detailed)
- Why use: Understands Ruby semantics, not just text matches
- ❌ Don't use Grep to search for method name strings

### 3. goToDefinition (Navigation)
**Find where a symbol is defined**
- Use when: Need to find where classes, modules, methods are defined
- Supports: Works with inheritance and mixins
- Why use: Understands Ruby scope, provides exact locations
- ❌ Don't use Grep to search for "def method_name"

### 4. hover (SECONDARY - Limited Use Cases)
**Get information from call sites and constants**
- Use when: Looking at a method call or constant reference and need quick info
- Works on: Method CALLS (not definitions), constants, variables
- Does NOT work on: Method definitions, local variables, most syntax
- Why limited: Only works on specific node types (CallNode, ConstantReadNode)
- ❌ Don't use for method signatures from definitions (use documentSymbol + Read)

## When to Use LSP (ALWAYS PREFER LSP)

**Use LSP operations proactively when:**

1. **Understanding file structure** → Use `documentSymbol`
2. **Finding method/class definitions** → Use `goToDefinition`
3. **Finding where a method/class is used** → Use `findReferences`
4. **Getting quick info from call sites** → Use `hover` (limited)

## When NOT to Use LSP (Use Standard Tools)

**Use standard tools when:**

1. **Reading full file contents** → Use Read (LSP only returns symbol info)
2. **Searching across multiple files for text patterns** → Use Grep (not symbol-specific)
3. **Editing or writing files** → Use Edit or Write (LSP is read-only)
4. **Non-Ruby files** → Use standard tools (LSP only works with .rb files)
5. **Finding string literals or comments** → Use Grep (text search, not semantic)
6. **Understanding project structure (directories, file organization)** → Use Glob, Bash
7. **Getting method signatures from definitions** → Use documentSymbol + Read (hover doesn't work on defs)

## Example Workflows

### Task: Understand and modify a Ruby method

1. ✅ documentSymbol - Get file structure with line numbers
2. ✅ Read relevant lines - See method definitions and signatures
3. ✅ findReferences - See where method is used (impact analysis)
4. ✅ goToDefinition - Navigate to related methods if needed
5. ✅ Edit - Make changes
6. ✅ findReferences again - Verify all call sites are still valid

### Task: Navigate unfamiliar Ruby codebase

1. ✅ documentSymbol - Get structure of current file
2. ✅ goToDefinition - Jump from calls to definitions
3. ✅ findReferences - See how symbols are used
4. ✅ Read - Examine implementation details when needed

### Task: Refactor a method safely

1. ✅ documentSymbol - Find method in current file
2. ✅ findReferences - Find all usages before changing (detailed output)
3. ✅ Read - Review implementation
4. ✅ Edit - Make refactoring changes
5. ✅ findReferences - Verify all call sites are updated

### Task: Quick lookup while reading code

1. ✅ Reading file, encounter `validator.check_amount(amount)`
2. ✅ hover on check_amount - Get signature without navigating
3. Continue reading with context

## Best Practices

1. **Start with documentSymbol** - Always get the structure first
2. **Use Read for signatures** - Don't try to hover on definitions
3. **Use hover sparingly** - Only when at call sites needing quick lookup
4. **Navigate with goToDefinition** - Not Grep searches
5. **Verify with findReferences** - Before and after refactoring (very detailed)
6. **Combine tools** - documentSymbol + Read + findReferences is the core workflow
7. **Fall back gracefully** - If LSP calls fail, use standard tools (Read, Grep)

Proactively use these 4 LSP operations throughout your Ruby development workflow for semantic code intelligence.
