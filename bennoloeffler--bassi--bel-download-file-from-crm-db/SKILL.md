# Download File from CRM Database

Download files stored in the CRM PostgreSQL database and save them to the filesystem in `_RESULTS_FROM_AGENT/`.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- Download a file from the CRM database to disk
- Retrieve a document/image/PDF stored in the database
- Save a database attachment to the filesystem
- Export file data from the CRM

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Download the contract from the database"
- "Save the file from CRM to disk"
- "Get me the PDF from database ID 123"
- "Retrieve the attachment for company X"
- "Export the image from the database"

**Do NOT use this skill if:**
- The user only wants to view/open a file (use `bel-open-file` instead)
- The user wants to see a file from the database (use `bel-show-crm-file` instead)
- The file is already on disk (no download needed)

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Use the CRM Database Skill for Schema Knowledge

To understand the database structure and query files, invoke the `bel-crm-db` skill first to get access to table schemas and connection details.

### Step 2: Identify the File to Download

Determine the `file_id` from the database. This may require querying tables that link to files:

**Common junction tables:**
- Files linked to companies: `company_site_file` table
- Files linked to people: `person_file` table
- Files linked to events: `event_file` table
- Files linked to opportunities: `sales_opportunity_file` table

**Example query to find files:**
```sql
-- Find all files for a company
SELECT f.file_id, f.file_name, f.mime_type, f.file_size
FROM file f
JOIN company_site_file csf ON f.file_id = csf.file_id
WHERE csf.company_site_id = 123;
```

### Step 3: Download the File

Execute the download script with the `file_id`:

```bash
python scripts/download_file_from_db.py <file_id>
```

**Options:**
```bash
# Download with custom output directory
python scripts/download_file_from_db.py 456 --output-dir /custom/path

# Quiet mode (only output file path)
python scripts/download_file_from_db.py 456 --quiet
```

### Step 4: Report Results to User

Inform the user where the file was saved:

```
✅ File downloaded successfully!
   File path: _RESULTS_FROM_AGENT/contract.pdf
   Original name: contract.pdf
   MIME type: application/pdf
   Size: 245,832 bytes
```

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

The script queries the `file` table with this structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE file (
    file_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    file_hash VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    file_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    mime_type VARCHAR(127),
    file_data BYTEA NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### File Storage

- **Default location:** `_RESULTS_FROM_AGENT/`
- **Filename collision handling:** Appends `_1`, `_2`, etc. if file exists
- **Path traversal protection:** Sanitizes filenames before saving

### Database Connection

The script uses environment variables for database connection:
- `POSTGRES_URL` (preferred): Full connection string
- Or individual variables: `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

## Error Handling

Common errors:
- **File not found:** `file_id` doesn't exist in database
- **Connection error:** Database credentials incorrect or server unavailable
- **Permission error:** Insufficient write permissions for output directory
- **Disk space:** Insufficient space for large files

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill integrates with:
- **`bel-crm-db`**: For schema knowledge and querying file metadata
- **`bel-open-file`**: To open the downloaded file after saving
- **`bel-show-crm-file`**: Orchestration skill that uses both download and open

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Download a specific file by ID
```
User: "Download file ID 789 from the database"

1. Use bel-crm-db to understand schema
2. Run: python scripts/download_file_from_db.py 789
3. Report the saved file path to user
```

### Workflow 2: Find and download a company's contract
```
User: "Download the contract for Acme Corp"

1. Use bel-crm-db to query:
   - Find company_site_id for "Acme Corp"
   - Find file_id via company_site_file junction table
2. Run: python scripts/download_file_from_db.py <file_id>
3. Report results to user
```

### Workflow 3: Download multiple files
```
User: "Download all images for event ID 5"

1. Query event_file junction table for all file_ids
2. Loop through each file_id:
   - python scripts/download_file_from_db.py <file_id>
3. Report all downloaded file paths
```
