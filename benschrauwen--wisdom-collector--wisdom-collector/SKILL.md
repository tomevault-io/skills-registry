# System Behavior Diagnosis and Leverage

## When to use
Use this when a problem keeps recreating itself, growth runs into limits, feedback arrives late or distorted, or a rule, metric, or fix produces side effects instead of lasting change.

## Diagnose from behavior to structure
1. **Observe behavior over time** — What is changing, what is stable, what is oscillating, and over what time scale?
2. **Identify the stock** — What quantity accumulates, drains, or buffers the system?
3. **Trace inflows and outflows** — What moves the stock up or down?
4. **Map feedback loops** — Which loops are balancing, which are reinforcing, and which dominates now?
5. **Separate delays** — Where are the information, decision, response, and physical delays?
6. **Set the boundary by purpose** — What outside stocks or processes matter for the time horizon you care about?
7. **Find the current limit** — What factor is binding now, and what next limit will growth create?
8. **Name the level of explanation** — Is the issue an event, a behavior pattern, or the underlying structure?

## Pattern cues
- Stable, recurring, or goal-seeking behavior usually points to a **balancing loop**.
- Accelerating growth or decline usually points to a **reinforcing loop**.
- Overshoot, oscillation, or repeated target-miss usually means a **delayed or over-strong balancing loop**.
- A problem that persists despite repeated fixes usually means the **structure recreates the problem**.
- Sustained growth usually means a **reinforcing growth loop** is meeting a **balancing constraint**.
- If growth continues, keep asking: **What limit does this growth create next?**

## Quick diagnostic prompts
- What is the stock?
- What are the inflows and outflows?
- What information reaches the decision maker, and when?
- Which loop is dominating right now?
- What delay keeps the system from correcting immediately?
- What hidden stock, leak, or outside process have I left in the cloud?
- Is the real bottleneck still the bottleneck, or has it shifted?

## Choose leverage
Work from lower leverage to higher leverage only as needed:

- **Numbers / parameters** — change constants, taxes, subsidies, or standards only when a threshold can trigger deeper change.
- **Buffers** — enlarge buffers when the system is too vulnerable; shrink them when it is too sluggish.
- **Stock-and-flow structure** — redesign bottlenecks, congestion, pollution, and capacity limits when the layout itself creates the problem.
- **Delays** — shorten delays if possible, but sometimes slowing the system is safer than speeding it up.
- **Balancing feedback** — strengthen weak corrective loops and sensing where correction is failing.
- **Reinforcing feedback** — weaken runaway compounding loops and the advantage that feeds on itself.
- **Information flows** — put timely, accurate, hard-to-distort feedback where the decision actually happens.
- **Rules** — change incentives, constraints, permissions, and enforcement when the system optimizes the wrong thing.
- **Self-organization** — preserve the ability to adapt, diversify, and create new structure.
- **Goals** — change what the system is trying to achieve.
- **Paradigms** — change the assumptions that generate goals, structures, and rules.
- **Transcending paradigms** — hold models lightly; stay open to surprise and to being wrong.

## Common system traps
- **Policy resistance** — multiple actors undo each other’s interventions. Search for a shared goal or a redesigned feedback structure.
- **Tragedy of the commons** — restore direct feedback between use and consequence.
- **Drift to low performance** — keep standards absolute instead of lowering them after weak results.
- **Escalation** — break the competitive loop or agree on limits.
- **Success to the successful** — level the playing field or create exits for losers.
- **Shifting the burden** — strengthen the system’s own repair capacity before withdrawing symptom relief.
- **Rule beating** — align the rule with its purpose, not just compliance.
- **Wrong goal** — test whether the metric actually reflects system welfare.

## Working habits
- Make assumptions explicit.
- Use small steps and monitor effects.
- Optimize the whole, not the parts.
- Design responsibility so decision makers feel consequences directly.
- Use language that names feedback, resilience, sustainability, and carrying capacity.
- Expect surprises; treat errors as data.
- Do not define the problem as "lack of my preferred solution."

## Quick model sketch
When the behavior is unclear, sketch a stock-and-flow model:
- `stock(t) = stock(t - dt) + (inflow - outflow) x dt`
- mark delays and information paths
- label balancing and reinforcing loops
- test how behavior changes when you vary rates, delays, buffers, or goals
