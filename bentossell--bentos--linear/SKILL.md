# Linear Tools

You have access to minimal Linear CLI tools for issue management. These are simple bash scripts that use Linear's GraphQL API.

## Available Tools

All scripts are in the skill directory and are executable. They output human-readable text.

### Authentication

```bash
./auth.js <your-api-key>
```
### assignee

My user account is ben@factory.ai

### List Issues

```bash
./issues.js                          # List all issues
./issues.js --team "TEAM-ID"         # Filter by team
./issues.js --assignee me            # Filter by current user
./issues.js --assignee user@email.com # Filter by assignee email
./issues.js --limit 20               # Limit results
./issues.js --id DR-20               # Fetch single issue by identifier
./issues.js DR-20                    # Fetch single issue (shorthand)
```

Fetches issues with their ID, identifier, title, description, status, team, and assignee. Use --id flag or pass issue identifier as first argument to fetch a single issue. Use --assignee to filter by assignee (supports "me" or email address).

### List Workflow States

```bash
./states.js
```

Lists all workflow states (statuses) with their IDs and names, grouped by team. Use these state IDs to change issue status.

### Manage Teams

```bash
./team.js                          # List all teams
./team.js <issue-id> <team-id>     # Move issue to team
./team.js OPS-1212 <team-id>       # Example: move issue to team
```

Lists all available teams with their IDs and keys, or moves an issue to a different team. Accepts either the short identifier (OPS-1212) or full UUID. Use without arguments to see all teams first.

### Change Issue Status

```bash
./status.js <issue-id> <state-id>
./status.js BLA-123 <state-id>
```

Updates an issue's workflow state. Accepts either the short identifier (BLA-123) or full UUID.
