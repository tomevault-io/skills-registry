## Task

Update the codebase graph to reflect recent changes.

$ARGUMENTS

## Protocol

1. Run `git log --oneline -10` to gauge how many commits since last update, then
   `git diff HEAD~N..HEAD --stat` where N covers all unreviewed commits (default to 5 if unsure)
2. For significantly changed files, read them to understand the new structure
3. Read the current `.claude/scratchpad/librarian/codebase_graph.md`
4. Update the codebase graph with:
   - New modules, classes, or functions
   - Changed interfaces or data shapes
   - Removed or renamed components
   - Updated import chains or dependencies

## Required Output

1. Update `.claude/scratchpad/librarian/codebase_graph.md` in place
2. Write a scratchpad entry to `.claude/scratchpad/librarian/YYYY-MM-DD.md` documenting what changed

## Convention Discovery (Self-Assemblage)

While updating the codebase graph, also scan for emergent conventions that may warrant formalization:

1. **Repeated patterns**: New coding patterns used 3+ times across different files without a matching rule in `.claude/rules/`. Examples: consistent error handling patterns, import ordering conventions, data validation idioms.
2. **Import conventions**: Import patterns that appear consistently — e.g., always importing from SRAI before h3, or always using `StudyAreaPaths` for path construction.
3. **Naming conventions**: Consistent naming patterns emerging in new code that aren't documented anywhere.

When a candidate convention is identified, note it in the librarian scratchpad as:

```
Candidate Convention: [pattern description]
- Seen in: [file1, file2, file3]
- Current rule: none / partial match in [rule file]
- Recommendation: formalize as rule / monitor / too early to tell
```

This is how the rule system grows organically — conventions emerge from practice, get noticed by the librarian, and are formalized only after proving their value across multiple sessions.
