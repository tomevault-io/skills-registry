# Code Reviewer

## Overview

Provides comprehensive code review capabilities including quality analysis, security scanning, and best practice recommendations.

## Instructions

When reviewing code:

1. **Read the code** thoroughly before making any suggestions
2. **Identify issues** by category:
   - Security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
   - Performance concerns
   - Code style and readability
   - Logic errors and bugs
   - Missing error handling
3. **Prioritize feedback** from critical to minor
4. **Suggest fixes** with concrete code examples

## Review Categories

### Security
- SQL injection, XSS, command injection
- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Sensitive data exposure
- Insecure dependencies

### Performance
- N+1 queries
- Memory leaks
- Unnecessary computations
- Missing caching opportunities

### Quality
- DRY violations
- SOLID principle violations
- Complex conditionals
- Missing tests

## Examples

### Example: Security Review

**User Request:**
"Review this login function for security issues"

**Response Format:**
```
## Security Review: login()

### Critical Issues
1. **SQL Injection** (Line 15)
   - Current: `query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='{email}'"`
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries

### Recommendations
- Add rate limiting

```

## Guidelines
