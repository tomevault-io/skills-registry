# Code Review Patterns

A language-agnostic framework for conducting comprehensive, context-aware code reviews that provide actionable feedback with real-world impact prioritization.

## Core Philosophy

Effective code reviews go beyond surface-level issues to understand root causes and systemic patterns. Focus on providing deep, actionable feedback that considers business context, not just technical correctness.

**Key principles:**
- Understand project context and conventions before reviewing
- Provide root cause analysis, not just symptoms
- Include working solutions with every issue
- Prioritize by real-world impact
- Adapt to the language and framework of the codebase

## Pre-Review Context Gathering

Before reviewing, establish context from the project itself:

1. **Read project documentation** - CLAUDE.md, README, CONTRIBUTING, ARCHITECTURE docs
2. **Detect conventions** - Linting configs, formatting rules, existing patterns
3. **Understand structure** - Directory layout, module organization, naming conventions
4. **Identify testing patterns** - Test framework, assertion style, coverage expectations
5. **Check language/framework** - Adapt review criteria to the stack

The codebase itself defines what "good" looks like - discover and apply those standards.

## Root Cause Analysis Framework

For every issue, provide three levels of analysis:

**Level 1 - What**: The immediate issue observed
**Level 2 - Why**: Root cause analysis explaining why this happens
**Level 3 - How**: Specific, actionable solution with working code

This ensures issues are fully understood and solutions address underlying problems, not just symptoms.

## Impact-Based Prioritization

Classify every issue by real-world impact:

| Priority | Label | Criteria | Action |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Red | Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, privacy violations, production crashes | Fix immediately |
| HIGH | Orange | Performance in hot paths, resource leaks, broken error handling, missing validation | Fix before merge |
| MEDIUM | Yellow | Maintainability issues, inconsistent patterns, missing tests, tech debt in active areas | Fix soon |
| LOW | Green | Style inconsistencies, minor optimizations, documentation gaps | Fix when convenient |

### Prioritization Factors

- **User-facing code** → Higher priority than internal utilities
- **Security-sensitive paths** (auth, payments, PII) → Highest priority
- **Frequently changed files** → Higher priority (high churn = high impact)
- **Hot paths** (high traffic) → Performance issues more critical

## Six Review Aspects

Comprehensive reviews cover six specialized aspects:

1. **Architecture & Design** - Module organization, separation of concerns, design patterns, dependency direction
2. **Code Quality** - Readability, naming, complexity, DRY principles, cognitive load
3. **Security & Dependencies** - Vulnerabilities, auth, input validation, supply chain
4. **Performance & Scalability** - Algorithm complexity, resource usage, async patterns, caching
5. **Testing Quality** - Meaningful assertions, isolation, edge cases, maintainability
6. **Documentation & API** - Self-documenting code, API docs, breaking changes

For detailed guidance on each aspect, see `references/review-aspects.md`.

## Cross-File Intelligence

Comprehensive review requires understanding relationships:

- **Component → Tests**: Is test coverage adequate?
- **Interface → Implementations**: Are all implementations consistent?
- **Config → Usage**: Do usage patterns align with configuration?
- **Fix → Call sites**: Are all callers handled?
- **API change → Documentation**: Is documentation updated?

Find related files before concluding a review is complete.

## Review Intelligence Layers

Apply five layers of analysis:

1. **Syntax & Style** - Follows project's linting/formatting rules
2. **Patterns & Practices** - Uses established patterns, avoids anti-patterns
3. **Architectural Alignment** - Code in correct layer, proper abstraction level
4. **Business Logic Coherence** - Logic matches requirements, edge cases handled
5. **Evolution & Maintenance** - How code ages, testability, extensibility

## Solution-Oriented Feedback

Never just identify problems - always show the fix. A quality issue report includes:

1. **Issue title** with file location
2. **Impact** - Real-world consequence
3. **Root cause** - Why this happens
4. **Solution** - Working code in the project's language/style
5. **Alternatives** (optional) - Other valid approaches

Adapt solutions to match the codebase's existing patterns and conventions.

## Review Output Template

Structure feedback consistently:

```markdown
# Code Review: [Scope]

## Review Metrics
- **Files Reviewed**: X
- **Critical Issues**: X
- **High Priority**: X
- **Medium Priority**: X
- **Suggestions**: X

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences summarizing the most important findings]

## CRITICAL Issues (Must Fix)
[Issues with root cause analysis and working solutions]

## HIGH Priority (Fix Before Merge)
[Issues with root cause analysis and working solutions]

## MEDIUM Priority (Fix Soon)
[Issues with root cause analysis and working solutions]

## LOW Priority (Opportunities)
[Suggestions and minor improvements]

## Strengths
[What's done well, patterns worth replicating]

## Proactive Suggestions
[Opportunities beyond identified issues]

## Systemic Patterns
[Issues appearing multiple times - candidates for team discussion]
```

### Reference Files

For detailed patterns and guidance, consult:
- **`references/focus-areas.md`** - Canonical definitions of the 6 focus areas with priority factors
- **`references/review-aspects.md`** - Deep dive into each review aspect with checklists

### Success Criteria

A quality review should:
- Understand project context and conventions first
- Adapt to the language and framework in use
- Provide root cause analysis, not just symptoms
- Include working solutions in the project's style
- Prioritize by real-world impact
- Consider evolution and maintenance
- Reference existing patterns in the codebase
