# Literature Review Skill

## Core Philosophy

A literature review is NOT a summary of what scholars have said. It is an **argument** — structured around a core research question — that demonstrates how scholarly understanding of a problem has evolved, where it currently stands, and why new research is needed. Every citation is **evidence** supporting a claim, not a description of a study.

**The golden rule: problem-driven, not literature-driven.** The reader should finish the review understanding the intellectual landscape of a question, not a catalogue of publications.

## Hard Gate

**DO NOT search for literature, outline, or begin writing until Phase 1 (Research Understanding) is fully completed and confirmed by the user.** The quality of a literature review depends entirely on the clarity of the research question it serves. Rushing to search before understanding the research guarantees a mediocre product.

## Process Overview

```
Phase 1: Research Understanding (Socratic dialogue with user)
    ↓ user confirms
Phase 2: Literature Discovery (seed → snowball → curate)
    ↓ user confirms corpus
Phase 3: Full-text Acquisition (self-attempt → user assistance)
    ↓ user provides missing papers
Phase 4: Exemplar Analysis (dissect 2-3 top-journal lit reviews)
    ↓
Phase 5: Architecture Design (propose structure for user approval)
    ↓ user approves
Phase 6: Drafting (write section by section, user reviews each)
    ↓ user approves all sections
Phase 7: Integration & Polish (combine, check citations, finalize)
```

## Phase 1: Research Understanding

### Goal
Achieve crystal-clear understanding of the user's research before touching any literature. Use Socratic questioning — one question at a time, building on each answer.

### Required Information (must collect ALL before proceeding)

1. **Research topic & object**: What exactly are you studying? What is the empirical case or phenomenon?
2. **Core research question**: What question does your research answer? (If the user can't articulate this clearly, help them formulate it through dialogue.)
3. **Disciplinary positioning**: Which academic field(s) does this sit in? Which scholarly conversations does it join?
4. **Theoretical orientation**: What theoretical lens or framework are you using or building on?
5. **Hypothesized contribution**: What do you think your research adds to existing knowledge? What makes your case or argument distinctive?
6. **Literature review scope**: What language (English, Chinese, both)? What time span? What journals matter most in your field?
7. **Output requirements**: Target word count? Part of a larger paper or standalone? Language of output?

### Questioning Strategy

- Ask ONE question per message. Do not overwhelm.
- Prefer multiple-choice when possible to help users clarify their thinking.
- When the user's answer is vague, probe deeper: "You mentioned X — can you be more specific about what makes this different from Y?"
- If the user struggles to articulate their contribution, offer candidate framings: "Based on what you've described, your contribution might be framed as A, B, or C — which resonates most?"
- Summarize your understanding after collecting all information and ask the user to confirm before proceeding.

### Confirmation Gate

Before moving to Phase 2, present a structured summary:

> **Research Summary for Confirmation:**
> - Topic: [...]
> - Research question: [...]
> - Field: [...]
> - Theoretical lens: [...]
> - Hypothesized contribution: [...]
> - Literature scope: [language, time span, key journals]
> - Output spec: [word count, language, format]
>
> Is this accurate? Any corrections before I begin searching for literature?

**Only proceed after explicit user confirmation.**

## Phase 2: Literature Discovery

### Step 2.1: Seed Literature

Identify 5-8 seed papers through:
- User-provided references (always ask: "Do you already have key papers in mind?")
- WebSearch for the most-cited papers on the core topic
- lit-review-mcp tools (resolve_papers, snowball_expand) if available

**Seed selection criteria:**
- Published in high-impact journals (see Journal Tier List below)
- Highly cited in the field
- Directly relevant to the core research question

### Step 2.2: Snowball Expansion

From seeds, expand outward:
- Use citation networks (who cites these papers? who do they cite?)
- Use lit-review-mcp snowball_expand if available
- Search for recent papers (last 3-5 years) that cite the classic seeds
- Search for papers that challenge or complicate the seeds

### Step 2.3: Curation

Target: **30-50 papers** in the final corpus.

**Curation rules:**
1. **Journal quality filter**: Strongly prefer Tier 1 and Tier 2 journals (see list below). Tier 3 papers may be used as search clues but should NOT appear in the final review unless they make a unique, irreplaceable contribution.
2. **Temporal balance**: Include both foundational/classic works AND recent publications (last 5 years). A review with no papers after 2020 looks outdated; a review with no papers before 2010 looks rootless.
3. **Perspective balance**: Include papers that support, complicate, and challenge the user's framing. A review that only cites sympathetic literature is unconvincing.
4. **Relevance triage**: Every paper must serve a specific argumentative function in the review. If you can't articulate why a paper is included, cut it.

### Journal Tier List (customize per field — below is for Urban Studies / China Studies)

**Tier 1 — Must-use if relevant:**
Urban Studies, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research (IJURR), Environment and Planning A/B/C/D, Progress in Human Geography, Antipode, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, The China Quarterly, Journal of Peasant Studies, World Development

**Tier 2 — Strong sources:**
Cities, Habitat International, Urban Geography, Regional Studies, China Economic Review, Journal of Contemporary China, Development and Change, Geoforum, Political Geography, Journal of Rural Studies, Land Use Policy

**Tier 3 — Use as search clues only:**
MDPI journals (Land, Sustainability, etc.), SCIRP journals, conference proceedings, working papers, book reviews

**Books from major university presses** (Oxford, Cambridge, Chicago, Minnesota, etc.) are equivalent to Tier 1 journal articles.

### Deliverable

Present the curated corpus to the user as a structured list:

| # | Author(s) | Year | Title | Journal/Publisher | Role in review |
|---|-----------|------|-------|-------------------|----------------|

Ask the user to review, suggest additions, or flag removals before proceeding.

---

## Phase 3: Full-text Acquisition

### Step 3.1: Self-attempt

For each paper in the corpus, attempt to obtain full text through:
1. Open access URLs (check OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar)
2. Author institutional repositories
3. WebFetch / Jina on known open-access versions
4. web-access skill CDP browser mode for publisher sites (if user's browser has institutional access)

### Step 3.2: Gap Report

For papers whose full text cannot be obtained, compile a clear list for the user:

> **Papers I could not access — please help me obtain these:**
>
> 1. Wu (2018) "Planning centrality, market instruments" — Urban Studies 55(7): 1383-1399
>    DOI: 10.1177/0042098017721828
> 2. [...]
>
> Please download these PDFs and save them to [working directory]. Once available, tell me and I'll read them.

### Step 3.3: Reading & Analysis

For each acquired paper, extract:
- Section structure and headings
- Core argument (in 2-3 sentences)
- How the literature review section is organized (if present)
- Key concepts or frameworks introduced
- Empirical evidence or cases used
- How it relates to the user's research question

**Store notes** in a working file for reference during drafting.

---

## Phase 4: Exemplar Analysis

### Goal
Before writing, study how excellent literature reviews in the user's field are actually constructed.

### Process

1. Select 2-3 papers from the corpus that are published in Tier 1 journals AND contain substantial literature review sections (or are themselves review articles).
2. For each, analyze and extract:
   - **Section architecture**: How many sections? What are the headings? What's the logical flow?
   - **Argumentative strategy**: How does the author establish the research gap? Through theoretical debate? Empirical contradiction? Conceptual genealogy?
   - **Citation technique**: How are citations used — as clustered evidence for claims (parenthetical) or as descriptions of individual studies ("Scholar X argued that...")?
   - **Transition logic**: How does the author move from one section to the next? What connects them?
   - **Opening strategy**: How does the paper begin — with a puzzle? A contradiction? A bold claim?

3. Present findings to user:

> **Exemplar Analysis: What top papers in your field do**
>
> Paper A uses [strategy]...
> Paper B uses [strategy]...
>
> For your review, I recommend combining [elements] because [reasoning].

## Phase 5: Architecture Design

### Design Principles (derived from experience)

1. **One core question runs through the entire review.** Every section answers or advances this question.
2. **Sections represent shifts in the answer**, not shifts in chronology. Time may be a dimension, but the organizing principle is how the scholarly answer to the question has changed.
3. **The research gap emerges from the logic of the argument**, not from a claim that "nobody has studied X." A credible gap is one that the reader can see is logically necessary given the preceding analysis.
4. **The opening creates cognitive tension** — present an anomaly, a contradiction, or a puzzle that the existing literature cannot resolve. This hooks the reader and justifies the review's existence.

### Structure Template (adapt to specific case)

```
1. Opening (~10% of word count)
   - Anomaly or puzzle that motivates the review
   - Core question stated explicitly
   - Roadmap of the argument

2-N. Body sections (~70% of word count)
   - Each section: one phase/dimension of how the question has been answered
   - Within each section: thesis statement → evidence (citations as proof) → limitation/transition
   - Transitions between sections: "This framework was powerful, but it carried an implicit assumption that..."

N+1. Gap & Contribution (~20% of word count)
   - What the preceding analysis reveals is missing
   - Why this gap matters (derived from the logic, not asserted)
   - How the present study addresses it
   - Honest engagement with adjacent work that partially overlaps
```

Present the proposed architecture to the user for approval before drafting.

---

## Phase 6: Drafting

### Writing Rules

1. **No "Scholar X argued/found/demonstrated" constructions.** Instead: state a claim, then cite evidence parenthetically.
   - BAD: "Hsing (2010) argued that local governments compete for land rents."
   - GOOD: "Local governments compete fiercely to capture land rents, using construction projects to consolidate territorial authority (Hsing, 2010)."

2. **Cluster citations** when multiple sources support the same point: "(Wang et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010; Hao et al., 2011)". Name individual scholars in the text ONLY when they introduced a distinctive concept that cannot be attributed generically.

3. **Every paragraph has a job.** It either advances the argument, provides evidence, or transitions to the next point. Paragraphs that merely describe a study without connecting it to the argument should be cut.

4. **Transitions are arguments, not connectors.** Don't write "Moving on to the next topic..." Write "This framework was powerful, but it carried an implicit assumption: that high-quality urbanization requires state direction. This assumption was thrown into relief by..."

5. **The gap section must be honest.** Acknowledge adjacent work (Hou, Smith, Chung & Unger, etc.) that partially addresses the space you're claiming. Explain precisely what remains unintegrated, not that nobody has ever looked at this.

### Process

- Write one section at a time.
- After each section, present to user for review.
- Incorporate feedback before proceeding to the next section.
- Track word count to stay within target.

---

## Phase 7: Integration & Polish

1. Combine all approved sections into a single document.
2. Check citation consistency — every parenthetical citation must appear in references; every reference must be cited in text.
3. Verify journal names, years, and volume/issue numbers against known data.
4. Compile the full reference list in the required citation style.
5. Read the complete review once more for argumentative coherence — does each section flow logically into the next?
6. Present the final integrated version to the user.

## Tool Usage

### Literature Search
- **WebSearch**: For discovering papers, checking journal impact, finding open-access versions
- **lit-review-mcp tools** (if available): resolve_papers, snowball_expand, run_snowball_pipeline, filter_by_topic, rank_by_importance
- **web-access skill CDP mode**: For accessing papers through the user's browser (institutional subscriptions)

### Full-text Reading
- **Read tool**: For PDFs downloaded to local workspace
- **WebFetch / Jina**: For open-access HTML versions
- **web-access skill CDP mode**: For reading papers through the user's authenticated browser sessions

### When Access Fails
**NEVER silently skip a paper you can't access.** Always report to the user:
- Which papers you could not access
- Why (paywall, 403, institutional login required)
- What the user should do (download PDF, log into university library, etc.)
- Where to save the files so you can read them

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

1. **Starting to search before understanding the research.** This produces a generic, unfocused literature dump.
2. **Organizing by chronology instead of argument.** Time can be a dimension within an argument, but "First scholars said X, then scholars said Y" is not an argument.
3. **Treating all papers equally.** Some papers deserve a sentence; some deserve a paragraph. Allocate space by argumentative importance, not by recency or citation count.
4. **Claiming "nobody has studied X."** Almost certainly someone has studied something adjacent. The honest move is to show what they studied, what they missed, and why the gap matters.
5. **Using small-journal papers as primary evidence.** These can help you find relevant work, but the review itself should be built on high-quality sources.
6. **Writing the review before reading exemplars.** You cannot produce publication-quality writing without first studying what publication-quality writing looks like in the specific field.
7. **Presenting a complete draft without iterative user review.** Academic writing is deeply personal — the user must shape it section by section.
