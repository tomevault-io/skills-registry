# PR Review Workflow (gh)

Use this skill when you need to create a PR, pull review comments, fix them
incrementally, and reply to each comment individually using `gh`.

## Quick Workflow

1) Create/update PR
- `gh pr create --fill --body-file /tmp/pr_body.txt`
- `gh pr edit --body-file /tmp/pr_body.txt`

2) Fetch review comments
- Summary/comments: `gh pr view <PR> --comments`
- Structured data: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments`
- Pagination (recommended for large threads): add `--paginate`
- Skip resolved threads by ignoring any comment that already has a reply
  (a matching `in_reply_to_id` exists) or that is marked resolved in the UI.
- Unresolved-only JSON (ignore replied-to threads):
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import json, subprocess
raw = subprocess.check_output(
    ["gh", "api", "--paginate", "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments"],
    text=True,
)
comments = json.loads(raw)
replied_to = {c.get("in_reply_to_id") for c in comments if c.get("in_reply_to_id")}
unresolved = [
    {
        "id": c.get("id"),
        "html_url": c.get("html_url"),
        "path": c.get("path"),
        "body": c.get("body"),
    }
    for c in comments
    if c.get("in_reply_to_id") is None and c.get("id") not in replied_to
]
print(json.dumps(unresolved, indent=2))
PY
```
- Unresolved-only JSON (jq):
```bash
gh api --paginate repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments \
  | jq '[. as $all
    | ($all | map(select(.in_reply_to_id != null) | .in_reply_to_id) | unique) as $replied
    | $all[]
    | select(.in_reply_to_id == null and (.id | IN($replied[]) | not))
    | {id, html_url, path, body}]'
```

3) Fix review notes commit-by-commit
- For each comment:
  - identify the target commit (use `commit_id` from the review payload, or
    `git log -- <file>`/`git blame`)
  - start `git rebase -i <base>` and mark the target commit `edit`
  - apply the fix
  - run validation **before** committing (normally `make lint`, `make unit`,
    and any relevant itests)
  - if the change affects scripts or build tooling, lint/unit may need to be
    omitted; ask the user and follow their direction
  - `git add <files>`
  - `git commit -m "! <short change>"`
  - continue the rebase, resolving conflicts if needed
  - repeat until all notes addressed
- Ensure fixes land in the commit the reviewer commented on:
  - Keep the fix commit directly after the original commit.
  - Confirm the diff for the addressed commit is updated.

4) Test after fixes
- Run extensive tests after applying fixes to ensure correctness.
- Prefer `make lint` and relevant unit/integration tests.
- Run per-fix validation before committing each change.
- After all fixes, run a final validation pass on the full branch.
- Note any tests not run in the PR response.

5) Reply to each comment individually (draft replies only)
- Always create or reuse a **pending review** and attach draft replies to it.
- Create a pending review (omit `event` to keep it draft):
  - `gh api -X POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/reviews -F body='Draft replies'`
- Add a draft reply to the pending review with GraphQL (supports replies):
  - `gh api graphql -f query='mutation($pullRequestId:ID!,$pullRequestReviewId:ID!,$inReplyTo:ID!,$body:String!){addPullRequestReviewComment(input:{pullRequestId:$pullRequestId,pullRequestReviewId:$pullRequestReviewId,inReplyTo:$inReplyTo,body:$body}){comment{url body}}}' \
      -f pullRequestId=<PR_NODE_ID> \
      -f pullRequestReviewId=<REVIEW_NODE_ID> \
      -f inReplyTo=<COMMENT_NODE_ID> \
      -f body='Acked; updated to ...'`
- If a pending review already exists, reuse it; do **not** submit the review.
- Reply content: describe **what changed and how**, without referencing commit
  hashes, rebases, or internal workflow mechanics. Example:
  - “Fixed by changing the default case to return `FailedState` with an explicit
    reason, so we fail closed on unexpected statuses.”

## Comment Formatting Rules

- Use real newlines, not literal `\n`.
- Do not manually hard-wrap paragraphs to 72/80 columns. GitHub renders and
  wraps comments/PR descriptions correctly in the UI; keep lines natural.
- For multi-line replies, prefer a heredoc:
```bash
gh api -X POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments \
  -F in_reply_to=<COMMENT_ID> \
  -F body=@- <<'EOF'
Applied fix:
- updated X
- refactored Y
EOF
```
- If using a file, prefer `-F body=@file` rather than shell string
  interpolation, to preserve newlines safely:
```bash
gh api -X POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<PR>/comments \
  -F body=@/tmp/comment.md
```
- Keep replies concise and specific to the change made.

## Fetch and Respond Example

1) Find comment IDs:
`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments`

2) Reply:
`gh api -X POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments \
  -F in_reply_to=<COMMENT_ID> \
  -F body='Updated sh() to use argv lists and removed shell=True.'`

## Notes

- `gh pr view <PR> --comments` is quick for a read-only pass.
- Use `gh api .../pulls/<PR>/comments` to get `id` values for replies.
- Keep each review response tied to its specific thread.
