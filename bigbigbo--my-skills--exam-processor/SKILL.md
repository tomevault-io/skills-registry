# Exam Processor

Process Word documents containing exam/test papers into structured markdown with proper image analysis and organization.

## Workflow

### 1. Use doc Skill for Document Extraction

First, invoke the `doc` skill to extract content from the DOCX file:

```
Use doc skill to extract all content including text, images, and formatting from [file.docx]
```

The doc skill will:
- Extract all text content with structure preserved
- Extract embedded images
- Preserve document formatting information

### 2. Extract and Save Images

After doc extraction, save all extracted images to an `images/` subdirectory:

- Create an output folder named after the input filename (e.g., for `math-exam-2024.docx`, create `math-exam-2024/` directory)
- Create `images/` subdirectory inside the output folder
- Save images with descriptive names based on context (e.g., `question-1-diagram.png`, `figure-2-a.png`)
- Use sequential numbering if context is unclear (e.g., `image-001.png`, `image-002.png`)

### 3. Analyze Images with Vision Tools

Use `mcp__zai-mcp-server__analyze_image` to understand each image:

```
Analyze the image at images/question-1-diagram.png with prompt: "Describe this image in detail, including any text, diagrams, mathematical expressions, or visual elements. Identify what type of exam question this image supports (multiple choice, calculation, diagram labeling, etc.)."
```

Extract from analysis:
- Image content description
- Text/expressions visible
- Question type context
- Any labels, numbers, or annotations

### 4. Match Images to Questions

Correlate each image with its associated question:

1. **Read image content** - Look for question numbers, text, or labels in the image
2. **Check surrounding text** - Match image position with question flow
3. **Verify context** - Use vision analysis to confirm the image relates to the specific question

For ambiguous cases, use vision tool with:
```
Analyze the image and determine which question number it belongs to based on any visible text, labels, or context clues.
```

### 5. Generate Structured Markdown

Create markdown output with:

**YAML Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
title: [Exam Title]
subject: [Subject Name]
date: [Exam Date or source document date]
total_questions: [count]
sections: [list of sections if applicable]
---
```

**Question Structure:**
```markdown
## Question 1

[Question text]

{Optional image reference}
![Question 1 diagram](images/question-1-diagram.png)
*Image description: [brief description from vision analysis]*

{For multiple choice}
a) [Option A]
b) [Option B]
c) [Option C]
d) [Option D]
```

**Section Organization:**
- Group questions by sections if the original document has them
- Use heading hierarchy: `#` for title, `##` for sections, `###` for questions
- Preserve numbering from original document

### 6. Verify and Validate

After generating markdown:

1. **Check all images are referenced** - Every saved image should be linked in the markdown
2. **Verify image-question alignment** - Confirm each image matches its question context
3. **Validate structure** - Ensure YAML frontmatter is complete and valid
4. **Check text completeness** - No questions or options should be missing

## Output File Structure

The output folder is named based on the input filename (without extension).

For example, if the input file is `math-exam-2024.docx`:

```
math-exam-2024/
├── exam-paper.md
└── images/
    ├── question-1-diagram.png
    ├── question-3-figure.png
    └── ...
```

If the input file is `physics-final.docx`:

```
physics-final/
├── exam-paper.md
└── images/
    ├── question-1-diagram.png
    ├── question-3-figure.png
    └── ...
```

## Tips

- When an image contains only the question text itself (e.g., screenshot of text), still include the image and transcribe the text
- For math expressions in images, use LaTeX notation in markdown: `$E = mc^2$`
- If image analysis is uncertain about context, note this in the image description
- Preserve original question numbering even if gaps exist
