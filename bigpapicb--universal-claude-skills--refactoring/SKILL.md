# Refactoring

## Decision Tree

```
Code looks messy → Should you refactor?
    ├─ Is it blocking the current task? → Yes → Refactor the minimum needed
    ├─ Is it actively causing bugs? → Yes → Refactor with tests first
    ├─ Will you touch this code again soon? → Yes → Refactor now (Boy Scout Rule)
    ├─ Is it working and rarely changed? → Leave it alone
    ├─ Does the user explicitly ask for refactoring? → Yes → Refactor per their scope
    └─ Is it just "not how I'd write it"? → Leave it alone
```

## Code Smells → Refactoring

| Smell | How to Detect | Refactoring |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Long function** (>30 lines) | Scrolling to read it | Extract Method — pull out logical blocks |
| **Duplicate code** | Same 3+ lines in 2+ places | Extract shared function or module |
| **Deep nesting** (>3 levels) | Arrow-shaped code | Early returns, guard clauses, extract helper |
| **God class** (does everything) | 500+ lines, 10+ methods | Split by responsibility into focused classes |
| **Primitive obsession** | Passing 5+ params, string IDs everywhere | Introduce value objects or typed IDs |
| **Feature envy** | Method uses another class's data more than its own | Move method to the class it envies |
| **Shotgun surgery** | One change requires editing 10 files | Group related logic into one module |
| **Dead code** | Unused imports, unreachable branches | Delete it (git has history if you need it back) |
| **Magic numbers/strings** | `if (status === 3)` | Extract named constant: `STATUS_ACTIVE = 3` |
| **Boolean blindness** | `doThing(true, false, true)` | Use options object or named parameters |

## Safe Refactoring Process

```
1. Ensure tests exist (write them first if they don't)
2. Make ONE small change
3. Run tests
4. Commit
5. Repeat
```

**Never refactor and change behavior in the same commit.** Refactoring = same behavior, better structure. New behavior = new commit.

## Common Refactoring Patterns

### Extract Early Returns (flatten nesting)

```
// Before
function process(user) {
  if (user) {
    if (user.active) {
      if (user.hasPermission) {
        return doWork(user);
      }
    }
  }
  return null;
}

// After
function process(user) {
  if (!user) return null;
  if (!user.active) return null;
  if (!user.hasPermission) return null;
  return doWork(user);
}
```

### Replace Conditional with Polymorphism

```
// Before
function getArea(shape) {
  switch (shape.type) {
    case 'circle': return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case 'rectangle': return shape.width * shape.height;
  }
}

// After — each shape knows how to calculate its own area
class Circle { getArea() { return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2; } }
class Rectangle { getArea() { return this.width * this.height; } }
```

### Replace Magic Values with Constants

```
// Before
if (retries > 3) { setTimeout(fn, 5000); }

// After
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
const RETRY_DELAY_MS = 5000;
if (retries > MAX_RETRIES) { setTimeout(fn, RETRY_DELAY_MS); }
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|-------------|-----|
| Refactoring without tests | Write tests first, then refactor |
| Big-bang rewrite | Incremental, one smell at a time |
| Refactoring code you won't touch again | Leave working code alone |
| Mixing refactoring with feature work | Separate commits: refactor, then feature |
| Premature abstraction | Wait for 3 instances before extracting (Rule of Three) |
| Renaming everything for style | Only rename if current name is misleading |
| Refactoring in a time crunch | Add a TODO, come back when there's time |
| "Just a quick cleanup" that touches 50 files | Scope it down — small, reviewable changes |
