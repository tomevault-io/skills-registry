# Marketing & SEO Skills Library

A library of 160+ specialist skills covering every domain of digital marketing. Each skill is a focused SKILL.md with frameworks, workflows, and production-ready guidance.

## How to Use

1. **Identify the right skill(s)** — match the user's request to one or more skills in the routing table below. When in doubt, check the "Key triggers" column.
2. **Read the sub-skill** — use the Read tool on the path `skills/<skill-path>.md` (relative to this file's directory).
3. **Apply it** — follow the sub-skill's instructions to complete the task.
4. **Chain skills** — for multi-step work, read related skills in dependency order (e.g., technical SEO → on-page → content).

**Project context**: Always check whether `project-context.md` exists in `.claude/` or `.cursor/` before running any skill. Sub-skills read it automatically for tailored output. Prompt the user to fill one in if they haven't already.

**Skip intro**: If the user says "skip intro" or "just do it," go straight to the actionable output — skip preamble.
