## Universal Coding Standards

**Understand before fixing** — Never propose a fix without identifying the root cause first. Symptom fixes create new bugs.

**Test before shipping** — Every change has a test. TDD preferred; tests-alongside acceptable; tests-after only for exploratory code.

**Name with intent** — Variable and function names should make comments unnecessary. If you need a comment to explain a name, rename it.

**Small functions, clear responsibilities** — Max 20 lines per function. One thing, done well. Composition over complexity.

**Library-first** — Before writing custom utilities, check if a well-maintained library already solves it. Don't build what you can import.

**Performance is measured, not assumed** — Profile before optimizing. Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
