name: dispatch
description: Master router and dispatcher for all skill suites. Identifies which suite to load based on the user's request and routes to it. Use this skill when the task domain is unclear, when a request spans multiple suites, or as the universal entry point before any specialized work begins. Covers all domains: UI/UX design, web development, visual art, marketing, copywriting, SEO, CRO, email, ads, DevOps, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, databases, coding, programming, architecture, APIs, testing, security, penetration testing, hacking, red team, blue team, startups, business strategy, product management, SaaS metrics, CRM, game development, Unity, Minecraft, AI agents, data science, machine learning, RAG, LLM, voice AI, productivity, task planning, ADHD, executive function, getting things done, organization. Trigger keywords: which skill, what suite, help me with, I need to, I want to build, I want to make, I'm working on, help me figure out, not sure where to start, route me, dispatch. Use when this capability is needed.

# Dispatch

**The master router. Every suite lives here. Read this first when you're not sure which expert to call.**

---

## How Dispatch Works

1. **Read the user's request**
2. **Match to a suite** using the routing table below
3. **Load that suite's SKILL.md** — it contains the sub-skill routing table
4. **Execute** following the suite's workflow

For multi-suite requests, identify the **primary suite** first, then note the secondary suites to involve.

## Ambiguous Cases — Tie-Breaker Rules

Some requests could reasonably route to multiple suites. Use these rules:

| Request Type | Primary Suite | Why |
|---|---|---|
| SEO audit of a website | **marketing-suite** | Tactical execution focus |
| SEO as a business growth strategy | **founders-suite** | Strategic/business context |
| A/B test setup for conversion | **marketing-suite** | CRO is marketing |
| A/B test statistical analysis | **research-lab** | Statistical methodology |
| Build a data dashboard | **design-studio** | Visual/UI output |
| Analyze data for insights | **research-lab** | ML/statistical output |
| API security review | **purple-team** | Security is the output |
| Build a secure API | **coding-suite** | Code is the output; security is a constraint |
| Launch strategy for a product | **founders-suite** | Business context |
| Launch strategy campaign copy | **marketing-suite** | Content is the output |
| Referral program mechanics | **founders-suite** | Business/growth strategy |
| Referral program copy | **marketing-suite** | Content is the output |
| Cloud cost optimization | **devops-suite** | Infrastructure focus |
| Pricing strategy for SaaS | **founders-suite** | Business strategy |
| Prompt engineering for an app | **coding-suite** | App development context |
| Prompt engineering as a craft | **research-lab** | LLM engineering focus |
| Agent memory architecture | **research-lab** | AI systems design |
| Memory in a coding project | **coding-suite** | Implementation context |
| Planning a coding project | **productivity-suite** | Execution/workflow first |
| Architecting a coding project | **coding-suite** | Technical design first |

**When genuinely ambiguous:** Route to the suite that owns the *output*, not the *input*.

## Multi-Suite Requests

Some tasks span multiple suites. Sequence them:

| Task | Sequence |
|---|---|
| "Build and launch a SaaS" | founders-suite → coding-suite → devops-suite → marketing-suite |
| "Build a game and market it" | game-dev → marketing-suite |
| "Audit our security and fix the code" | purple-team → coding-suite |
| "Design and build a dashboard" | design-studio → coding-suite |
| "Build an AI product" | research-lab → coding-suite → founders-suite |
| "I'm overwhelmed, help me build this app" | productivity-suite → coding-suite |
| "Pentest our app then harden it" | purple-team (red) → purple-team (blue) |
| "Launch campaign with copy and analytics" | marketing-suite → devops-suite (tracking setup) |

**Rule**: Always complete the primary suite's work before loading the secondary. Don't try to run both simultaneously.

## Suite Quick Reference

```
design-studio    → Making things look and feel right
marketing-suite  → Getting people to notice, click, and convert
devops-suite     → Making systems run reliably at scale
coding-suite     → Writing correct, maintainable software
founders-suite   → Building and scaling a business
game-dev         → Making games people want to play
research-lab     → AI agents, data science, LLM engineering
purple-team      → Breaking things (red) and fixing them (blue)
productivity-suite → Getting things done when your brain won't cooperate
```

---

## If Still Unsure

Ask one question: **"What is the primary deliverable?"**

- A visual artifact → **design-studio**
- Marketing content or a conversion → **marketing-suite**
- Running infrastructure → **devops-suite**
- Working code → **coding-suite**
- A business decision or document → **founders-suite**
- A game → **game-dev**
- An AI system or data insight → **research-lab**
- A security finding or fix → **purple-team**
- A completed task or organized life → **productivity-suite**
