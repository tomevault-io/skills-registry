## Loading Sub-Skills

Each sub-skill has detailed instructions in `references/skills-catalog.md`. For the most commonly used skills, full instructions are reproduced there. Structure:

```
marketing-suite/
├── SKILL.md                    ← You are here (routing hub)
└── references/
    ├── skills-catalog.md       ← Full instructions for all 30+ skills
    ├── workflow.md             ← 8-phase marketing pipeline
    └── agents-guide.md        ← 20 specialist agents and when to use them
```

**When to read reference files:**
- `skills-catalog.md` — Always read the relevant skill section before executing any task
- `workflow.md` — Read for complex multi-step campaigns or when the user asks for a full marketing plan
- `agents-guide.md` — Read when running in an agent-capable environment (Claude Code, Cowork) and the task would benefit from specialist delegation

---

## Universal Standards

Apply these to every marketing task:

**Language**: Always respond in the user's language. If they write in Spanish, respond in Spanish.

**Product Context First**: Before asking the user questions, check:
1. `./agents/product-marketing-context.md`
2. `.claude/product-marketing-context.md`
3. `./docs/brand-guidelines.md`

If context files exist, extract answers from them and only ask for what's missing.

**Output Quality**:
- Specificity over vagueness — real numbers beat adjectives
- Benefits over features — outcomes over mechanics  
- Customer language over company jargon
- Token efficiency — concise, scannable, actionable

---

## Multi-Tool Integrations

This skill is compatible with 60+ marketing tool integrations. When a task requires live data, check `references/tools-registry.md` for available MCP connections including:

**Analytics**: GA4, Google Search Console, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Adobe Analytics
**CRM/Email**: HubSpot, Salesforce, Klaviyo, ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp
**Ads**: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads

---

## Getting Started

**For a single task**: Tell me what you're working on. I'll route to the right skill and execute.

**For a full campaign**: Say "run a full marketing campaign for [product]" and I'll activate the 8-phase pipeline from `references/workflow.md`.

**For brand setup**: Say "set up product marketing context" and I'll help you create a context file that makes all future tasks faster and more accurate.
