# WINDI Identity License Validator

Validate institutional identity licenses for document governance.

## Key Discovery

"Simulating real institutional identity ACTIVATES institutional governance."

Documents using real company/institution identity require license validation.

## Behavior Matrix

1. MODEL_ONLY (no license):
   - No institutional logo
   - Mandatory disclaimer: "Model document - does not represent [institution]"
   - Use only for educational/demonstration purposes

2. AUTHORIZED (valid license):
   - Logo permitted per scope
   - Full institutional identity
   - Check expiration date and specific permissions

3. EXPIRED (expired license):
   - Block identity use
   - Alert about renewal need
   - Revert to MODEL_ONLY

4. REVOKED (revoked license):
   - Total block
   - Log attempt in ledger
   - Do not allow even model use

## Validation Output

When validating identity licenses, structure as:

WINDI IDENTITY LICENSE CHECK

Status: [MODEL_ONLY/AUTHORIZED/EXPIRED/REVOKED]

"O template NUNCA decide o nível. A API decide. O template apenas manifesta."
