# Production Code Review

A systematic code review skill emphasizing implementation correctness, scalability, and production readiness for high-performance Python/PyTorch codebases.

## Quick Start

When asked to review code:
1. Read the files to be reviewed
2. Apply the review checklist systematically
3. Report findings by severity (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
4. Provide actionable recommendations with code examples

## Review Checklist

### 1. Correctness (Critical Priority)

**Algorithm correctness**:
- [ ] Does the implementation match the documented algorithm/formula?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled (empty inputs, single elements, boundary conditions)?
- [ ] Are mathematical operations numerically stable (log-space, overflow/underflow)?
- [ ] Are tensor shapes consistent throughout the computation?

**Type safety**:
- [ ] Are dtypes explicitly specified where precision matters (float32 vs float64)?
- [ ] Are device placements consistent (CPU/CUDA tensors not mixed)?
- [ ] Are integer divisions handled correctly (// vs /)?

**Memory correctness**:
- [ ] Are tensors properly detached when needed to prevent gradient leaks?
- [ ] Are in-place operations used safely (not on leaf tensors requiring grad)?
- [ ] Are views vs copies handled correctly?

### 2. Scalability (High Priority)

**Memory complexity**:
- [ ] What is the memory complexity? Document as O(?) in comments
- [ ] Are large intermediate tensors avoided or cleared?
- [ ] Is there unnecessary materialization of sparse/structured data?
- [ ] Can computation be chunked/streamed for large inputs?

**Compute complexity**:
- [ ] What is the time complexity? Document as O(?) in comments
- [ ] Are there nested loops that could be vectorized?
- [ ] Are redundant computations cached/memoized?
- [ ] Are expensive operations (matmul, attention) optimized?

**Scaling characteristics**:
- [ ] How does memory scale with batch size? Sequence length? Feature dimension?
- [ ] Are there O(N²) or O(N³) operations that could bottleneck at scale?
- [ ] Is the implementation suitable for the target scale (e.g., T=400K sequences)?

### 3. Production Readiness (High Priority)

**Error handling**:
- [ ] Are inputs validated with informative error messages?
- [ ] Are assertions used for internal invariants (not user-facing validation)?
- [ ] Are exceptions specific and actionable?

**Robustness**:
- [ ] Does code handle NaN/Inf gracefully?
- [ ] Are there fallbacks for numerical instability?
- [ ] Is behavior deterministic (or explicitly documented as non-deterministic)?

**Observability**:
- [ ] Are warnings issued for suspicious inputs (e.g., non-zero-centered data)?
- [ ] Can intermediate values be inspected for debugging?
- [ ] Are performance-critical paths identifiable for profiling?

**API design**:
- [ ] Is the public API minimal and well-documented?
- [ ] Are default values sensible for common use cases?
- [ ] Is the API consistent with similar functions in the codebase?

### 4. Code Quality (Medium Priority)

**Readability**:
- [ ] Do variable names convey meaning (avoid single letters except in math)?
- [ ] Are complex computations broken into named intermediate steps?
- [ ] Are magic numbers extracted into named constants?

**Documentation**:
- [ ] Do docstrings follow PyTorch conventions (see docstring skill)?
- [ ] Are mathematical formulas documented with LaTeX notation?
- [ ] Are tensor shapes documented in Args/Returns?

**Testing implications**:
- [ ] Is the code structured to be testable (pure functions, minimal side effects)?
- [ ] Are there obvious test cases suggested by the implementation?
- [ ] Are edge cases documented for test coverage?

### 5. PyTorch/CUDA Specific (Medium Priority)

**Device handling**:
- [ ] Are new tensors created on the correct device?
- [ ] Is `.to(device)` used correctly without unnecessary transfers?
- [ ] Are CUDA synchronization points minimized?

**Gradient flow**:
- [ ] Will gradients flow correctly through all necessary paths?
- [ ] Are `torch.no_grad()` contexts used appropriately?
- [ ] Are custom autograd Functions implemented correctly?

**Performance patterns**:
- [ ] Are contiguous tensors used before view operations?
- [ ] Is `torch.compile` compatible (no graph breaks)?
- [ ] Are operations fusible by the compiler?

## Severity Definitions

**Critical**: Will cause incorrect results, crashes, or data corruption
- Algorithm bugs, incorrect tensor operations, memory corruption

**High**: Significant impact on performance or reliability at scale
- O(N²) where O(N) is possible, memory leaks, silent failures

**Medium**: Affects maintainability or has minor performance impact
- Missing validation, poor naming, undocumented assumptions

**Low**: Style issues or minor improvements
- Formatting, optional optimizations, documentation gaps

## Review Output Format

Structure your review as follows:

```markdown
## Summary

## Critical Issues

**Location**: `file.py:123`
**Problem**: [Description of the issue]
**Impact**: [What could go wrong]
**Fix**:
```python
# Before

```

## High Priority

[Same format as Critical]

## Medium Priority

[Same format, can be briefer]

## Low Priority

[Bullet points acceptable]

## Positive Observations

- [What's done well - important for balanced feedback]

## Recommendations

2. [With rationale]
```

## Common Patterns to Flag

### Memory Issues

```python
# BAD: Materializes O(T*K*C²) tensor
edge = torch.zeros(batch, T, K, C, C)
for t in range(T):
    for k in range(K):
        edge[:, t, k] = compute_edge(t, k)

# GOOD: Compute on-the-fly with O(KC) memory
for t in range(T):
    for k in range(K):
        edge_block = compute_edge(t, k)  # (batch, C, C)
        process_and_discard(edge_block)
```

### Numerical Stability

```python
# BAD: Overflow at large T
cumsum = torch.cumsum(x, dim=1)  # Values grow to O(T)

# GOOD: Zero-center to keep values O(√T)
x_centered = x - x.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)
cumsum = torch.cumsum(x_centered, dim=1)
```

### Gradient Issues

```python
# BAD: Breaks gradient flow
if condition:
    return tensor.detach()  # Silent gradient death
return tensor

# GOOD: Explicit gradient handling
with torch.no_grad():
    # Operations that shouldn't have gradients
    ...
```

### Device Mismatches

```python
# BAD: Creates tensor on CPU, data on GPU
mask = torch.zeros(batch, T)  # CPU!
result = data * mask  # Error or silent transfer

# GOOD: Match device explicitly
mask = torch.zeros(batch, T, device=data.device)
```

## Instructions for Claude

When reviewing code:

1. **Read thoroughly**: Read all files before commenting. Understand the full context.

2. **Check the math**: Verify algorithms against any documented formulas or papers.

3. **Think at scale**: Consider behavior at 10x, 100x, 1000x the test scale.

4. **Be specific**: Point to exact lines, provide concrete fixes.

5. **Prioritize**: Focus on correctness first, then scalability, then style.

6. **Be constructive**: Explain why something is problematic, not just that it is.

7. **Acknowledge good code**: Note well-implemented patterns and clever solutions.

8. **Consider context**: A research prototype has different standards than production code.

## Project-Specific Reference

When reviewing Semi-Markov CRF code (streaming vs exact backends, edge tensors, loop bounds), consult:

**[STREAMING_VS_EXACT_CONVENTIONS.md](STREAMING_VS_EXACT_CONVENTIONS.md)**

This document covers:
- Tensor shapes and dimension conventions
- The critical `lengths + 1` convention when using SemiMarkov with streaming-style edge tensors
- Loop bounds for all implementations (PyTorch reference, Triton kernel, SemiMarkov class)
- Duration indexing (`dur_idx = min(k, K - 1)`)
- Common bug sources (off-by-one errors, score preprocessing mismatches)

## Example Review Invocations

```
Review the streaming.py implementation for production readiness

Audit the backward pass for numerical stability issues

Check if this code will scale to T=400K sequences

Review this PR for memory leaks and gradient issues
