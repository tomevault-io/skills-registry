# Git Commit Guidelines

Follow these rules when creating commits for this repository.

## The 7 Rules

1. **Separate subject from body with a blank line**
2. **Limit the subject line to 50 characters**
3. **Capitalize the subject line**
4. **Do not end the subject line with a period**
5. **Use the imperative mood** ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
6. **Wrap the body at 72 characters**
7. **Use the body to explain what and why vs. how**

## Key Principles

**Be concise, not verbose.** Every word should add value. Avoid unnecessary details about implementation mechanics - focus on what changed and why it matters.

**Subject line should stand alone** - don't require reading the body to understand the change. Body is optional and only needed for non-obvious context.

**Focus on the change, not how it was discovered** - never reference "review feedback", "PR comments", or "code review" in commit messages. Describe what the change does and why, not that someone asked for it.

**Avoid bullet points** - write prose, not lists. If you need bullets to explain a change, you're either committing too much at once or over-explaining implementation details.

## Format

Always use a HEREDOC to ensure proper formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Subject line here

Optional body paragraph explaining what and why.
EOF
)"
```

## Good Examples

```
Add session validation for GitHub repository URLs
```

```
Fix race condition in session creation

Multiple concurrent requests for the same repo could create duplicate
sessions. Added KV-based locking with 30-second TTL.
```

```
Add observability with logs and traces
```

## Bad Examples

```
Update files

Changes some things related to sessions and also fixes a bug.
```

Problem: Vague subject, doesn't explain what changed

```
Add session handling

Implements session creation with locking mechanism using KV storage
and adds validation for GitHub owner/repo names using regex patterns.
Includes comprehensive error handling with custom error types and
supports both new session creation and existing session lookup.
```

Problem: Over-explains implementation details, uses too many words
