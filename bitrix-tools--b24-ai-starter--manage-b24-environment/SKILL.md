# Manage Bitrix24 Environment

## Quick Start

The project uses Docker Compose and Makefiles to manage the development environment.

### Common Commands

```bash
# Start the environment (choose one backend)
make dev-php      # For PHP backend
make dev-python   # For Python backend
make dev-node     # For Node.js backend

# Stop all services
make down

# View logs
make logs         # All logs
docker logs api   # Backend logs
docker logs frontend # Frontend logs

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart api
docker compose restart frontend
```

## Environment Setup

1.  **Initial Setup**: Run `make dev-init` to interactively set up the project (select backend, configure `.env`, setup Cloudpub).
2.  **Configuration**: All configuration is in `.env`.
    *   `CLOUDPUB_TOKEN`: Required for public URL (get from cloudpub.ru).
    *   `CLIENT_ID` / `CLIENT_SECRET`: Bitrix24 application credentials.
    *   `SERVER_HOST`: Backend URL (e.g., `http://api-php:8000`).

## Cloudpub & Tunnels

The project uses Cloudpub to expose the local environment to Bitrix24.

*   **Public URL**: Found in `docker logs cloudpubFront` or `.env` (`VIRTUAL_HOST`).
*   **Troubleshooting**:
    *   If the tunnel is not working, check `CLOUDPUB_TOKEN` in `.env`.
    *   On macOS (ARM64), ensure `platform: linux/amd64` is set for the cloudpub service in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Database Management

*   **PHP**: Run `make dev-php-init-database` to apply migrations.
*   **Python/Node**: Database is initialized automatically on first run.
*   **Access**:
    *   PostgreSQL/MySQL runs in the `database` container.
    *   Credentials in `.env` (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`).

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Cloudpub not starting"**: Check token validity and architecture (amd64 vs arm64).
*   **"Frontend not connecting"**: Check `SERVER_HOST` matches the running backend.
*   **"JWT Error"**: Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set and matches between services (if applicable).
