- **Attributes**: Core stats (STR, DEX, INT), derived stats, stat scaling
- **Skills**: Active abilities, passive perks, character traits, talent specializations
- **Balance**: Progression curves, diminishing returns, power spikes, advancement pacing
- **Mastery systems**: Specialization paths, expertise levels, skill trees

## Entity Types (10 total)

- **mastery** - Mastery levels, expertise tiers, skill proficiency
- **progression_event** - Specific progression moments, advancement events
- **progression_state** - Current progression status, character advancement state

## Processing Guidelines

When extracting progression entities from chapter text:

1. **Identify progression elements**:
   - Level mentions or milestones (level 5, reached a new tier)
   - Skill/ability unlocks (learned a new technique)
   - Stat improvements or changes (stronger, faster, smarter)
   - Training or learning moments (completed training, mastered something)

2. **Extract progression details**:
   - What characters can do now vs before (new capabilities)
   - New abilities or power levels (strength increases)
   - Attribute changes (agility increased, intelligence boosted)
   - Talent trees or specializations mentioned (skill paths)

3. **Track progression events**:
   - Level up moments (Kira reached level 15)
   - Skill unlocks (learned Shadow Strike)
   - Training completions (mastered the elder's teachings)
   - Mastery achievements (expertise in shadow arts)

4. **Contextualize progression**:
   - Which character is progressing
   - What triggered the advancement
   - How the progression affects capabilities
   - Multiple characters (track all, not just protagonist)

## Output Format

Generate `entities/progression.json` with plural collections and domain fields:

```json

      "version": 1
    }
  ],
  "next_id": 3
}
```

## Key Considerations

- **Implicit progression**: Characters getting stronger may be implied, not explicitly stated
- **Skill trees**: Look for mentioned or implied specialization paths
- **Balance**: Progression should feel earned through training/experience, not arbitrary
- **Multiple characters**: Track progression for all characters in the scene, not just the protagonist
- **Training context**: Progression often follows training, practice, or revelation

## Example

**Input:**
> "Kira felt different. The training had paid off. She could now move faster, see further. The elder's teachings about shadow arts had unlocked something within her—she could strike from darkness like never before."

**Extract (short):**
```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "id": 10,
      "character_id": 3,
      "name": "Shadow Strike",
