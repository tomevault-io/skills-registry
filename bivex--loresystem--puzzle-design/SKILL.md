## Processing Guidelines

When extracting puzzle and secret entities from chapter text:

   - Hidden paths or secret passages
   - Puzzles or mechanical challenges
   - Traps or hazards
   - Easter eggs or secrets
   - Mysteries or enigmas

2. **Extract puzzle/secret details**:
   - Puzzle types, solutions, difficulty
   - Hidden path access methods
   - Trap triggers and effects
   - Riddle content and answers
   - Easter egg locations and rewards

3. **Analyze puzzle/secret context**:
   - Optional vs required content
   - Hint availability (optional hints, fair puzzles)
   - Difficulty scaling (early game vs late game)
   - Reward scaling (better secrets = better rewards)

4. **Create schema-compliant entities** with proper JSON structure

## Key Considerations

- **Fairness**: Puzzles should have logical solutions
- **Hint systems**: Players should have access to hints if stuck
- **Optional content**: Secrets shouldn't block main story
- **Difficulty scaling**: Puzzles should match player progress
- **Multiple solutions**: Some puzzles allow creative solutions
- **Trap balance**: Traps shouldn't be unfair or instant-death
