   - Audio/visual cues (music, lighting, effects)
   - Transportation (mounts, vehicles, travel points)
   - Legendary items or artifacts
   - Technical systems (UI, save points, checkpoints)

2. **Extract all remaining details**:
   - Item stats, crafting recipes, enchantments
   - Achievement criteria, rewards
   - Audio tracks, visual effects, shaders
   - Cinematic moments, camera movements
   - Transportation types and abilities
   - Legendary item properties and legends

3. **Create schema-compliant entities** with proper JSON structure

## Key Considerations

- **Completeness**: You are safety net—don't miss entities
- **Consistency**: Maintain schema consistency with other subagents
- **Quality**: Even technical entities need rich details
- **Integration**: Technical entities link to narrative/gameplay elements
