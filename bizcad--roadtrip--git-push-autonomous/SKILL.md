# Git-Push Autonomous Skill

## Overview

Safely and autonomously stages, commits, and pushes repository changes with zero user interaction. Designed for **trusted workflows** where files are pre-filtered and safety rules are well-established.

**Key capability**: Eliminates manual `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` ceremony while maintaining safety via automated validation.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Detects changes** in working tree
2. **Validates permissions** (auth-validator skill)
3. **Checks files against rules** (rules-engine skill)
4. **Generates commit message** from file changes (or uses custom message)
5. **Stages all validated files** (`git add`)
6. **Commits** with auto-generated or custom message
7. **Pushes to origin** on current branch
8. **Logs decision + result** (telemetry-logger skill)

**Result**: Fully committed and pushed, auditable via telemetry logs.

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Exclusion Rules (Pre-Configured)
Files matching patterns are **always blocked**:
- `.env`, `.secrets`, `credentials.json`
- `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`
- `*.tmp`, `*.log`

### 2. Permission Validation
Calls `auth-validator` skill to verify git identity and permissions.

### 3. Audit Trail
Every decision logged with timestamp, decision, reason, files affected, and confidence scores.

### 4. Graceful Degradation
If a validator fails, blocks push rather than guessing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Push
```
You: "Push my changes"

Orchestrator:
1. Check changes: src/main.rs, docs/README.md → Safe
2. Validate auth: ✓ Credentials valid
3. Validate rules: ✓ No blocked files
4. Generate message: "chore: update 2 files (+12, ~3, -0)"
5. Commit + push: Success
6. Log: Entry ID log-2026-02-05-abc123

Result: ✓ Done. Telemetry: log-2026-02-05-abc123
```

### Example 2: Blocked Files
```
You: "Push changes"

Orchestrator:
1. Check changes: src/main.rs, .env, config.yaml
2. Validate rules: ✗ .env is blocked

Result: ✗ BLOCKED. .env matches exclusion pattern.
        Remove it and retry.
        Telemetry: log-2026-02-05-xyz789
```

## Phase Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Now)
- ✅ Autonomous push with CLI-based git
- ✅ File exclusion rules
- ✅ Auth validation (basic)
- ✅ Telemetry logging
- Status: **Ready to test**

### Phase 2 (Next)
- Swap CLI → GitHub SDK
- Confidence-based gating
- Learning: Auto-tune rules from successful pushes

---

**Status**: Phase 1 MVP ready for testing
