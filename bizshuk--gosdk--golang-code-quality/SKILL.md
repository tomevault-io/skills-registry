# golang-code-quality

A senior Go code quality review workflow, with a focus on **simplicity (簡潔性)** and **scalability (可擴展性)** — NOT testing. Guiding philosophy: code should be obvious to read, hard to misuse, and easy to extend without modification.

## Core Philosophy / 核心哲學

> "Clear is better than clever." — Rob Pike

Two non-negotiable goals when reviewing or writing Go:

1. **Simplicity**: A new engineer should understand any single function in under 60 seconds.
2. **Scalability**: Adding a new feature should mean adding new code, rarely modifying existing code (Open/Closed Principle).

If a piece of code violates either, flag it.

---

## 1. SOLID Principles in Go

Go has no inheritance — apply SOLID through **composition**, **small interfaces**, and **package boundaries**.

### S — Single Responsibility Principle

- One package = one reason to change. One struct = one responsibility.
- ❌ A `UserService` that handles auth, billing, and email notifications.
- ✅ Split into `auth.Service`, `billing.Service`, `notify.Service`.

### O — Open/Closed Principle

- Code should be open for extension, closed for modification.
- Achieved via **interfaces** + **strategy pattern**.
- ❌ `if paymentType == "stripe" { ... } else if paymentType == "paypal" { ... }`
- ✅ `type PaymentProvider interface { Charge(ctx, amount) error }` — add new providers without touching existing code.

### L — Liskov Substitution Principle

- Any implementation of an interface must honor its contract (including error semantics, nil-safety, idempotency).
- ❌ One `Storage.Get` returns `nil, nil` for missing keys; another panics.
- ✅ Define explicit sentinel errors like `ErrNotFound` in the interface's package and require all implementations to use them.

### I — Interface Segregation Principle

- **Define interfaces where they are consumed, not where they are implemented.**
- Prefer many small interfaces over one fat interface. `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` are the gold standard.
- ❌ `type UserRepo interface { Get; Create; Update; Delete; Search; Export; Import }` consumed by a handler that only needs `Get`.
- ✅ Handler defines `type userGetter interface { Get(ctx, id) (*User, error) }` locally.

### D — Dependency Inversion Principle

- High-level modules depend on **abstractions**, not concrete implementations.
- Constructor injection is the idiomatic Go way (no DI frameworks needed).
- ❌ `func NewHandler() *Handler { return &Handler{db: postgres.New()} }`
- ✅ `func NewHandler(repo UserRepo, logger Logger) *Handler { ... }`

## 2. Package Structure (MVC-style)

Enforce this layered architecture. **Dependencies flow downward only** — handler → service → model. No upward or sideways imports between siblings.

| Package                | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                      | What MUST NOT be there                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `config/`              | Load configuration. Prefer `config.Default()` from `github.com/bizshuk/gosdk`, falling back to `viper` if not supported. Initialize external clients (DB, Redis, S3, HTTP clients). | Business logic, domain types                    |
| `handler/`             | Aggregate domain logic. Orchestrate calls to services. **All business rules live here.**                                                                                            | Direct DB calls, raw HTTP calls, config loading |
| `service/` (or `svc/`) | Wrap external services. Basic error handling, retries, timeout enforcement. **Thin adapters only.**                                                                                 | Domain logic, business rules                    |
| `model/`               | Data structures + conversions between them (DTO ↔ domain ↔ persistence).                                                                                                            | Behavior beyond conversion, I/O                 |
| `validation/`          | Common validation rules. **Each validator must have an explicit, descriptive name.**                                                                                                | Business decisions, side effects                |
| `utils/`               | Non-business, non-functional concerns: metrics emission, callbacks, helper closures.                                                                                                | Anything domain-specific                        |

### Validation naming rule

Validators must be named for **what they check**, not where they're used:

- ❌ `validateInput`, `checkUser`, `validate`
- ✅ `ValidateEmailFormat`, `ValidateAgeRange`, `ValidatePasswordComplexity`

### Architectural smell checks

- Does `service/` import `handler/`? → **Violation**, flag it.
- Does `model/` have any I/O? → **Violation**, models are pure data.
- Is there business logic inside `service/`? → Move to `handler/`.
- Is `utils/` becoming a junk drawer? → Split into named packages (`metrics/`, `callback/`).

---

## 3. Package Naming (per <https://go.dev/blog/package-names>)

Enforce these rules strictly:

- **Short, lowercase, no underscores, no mixedCaps.** `userauth` not `user_auth` or `userAuth`.
- **Singular, not plural.** `user` not `users`. (Use `model` (singular) as the default package for domain models, unless there are more than 30 models, in which case they must be split into domain-specific packages).
- **Avoid generic names**: `util`, `common`, `base`, `helpers`, `misc`, `shared`. These signal a missing abstraction.
- **No stutter.** If the package is `user`, the type is `User` not `user.UserModel`. Callers write `user.New()` not `user.NewUser()`. (Exception: the `model` package can contain a `model.User` or similar domain structs).
- **Name describes what it provides, not what it contains.** `http` not `httpfunctions`.
- The acceptable exception to `utils/` per the user's convention: it stays narrowly for non-business cross-cutting concerns (metrics, callbacks). If it grows beyond that, split it.

---

## 4. Error Handling Conventions

- **Errors are values.** Return them, don't panic. `panic` only for truly unrecoverable programmer errors (nil pointer in init, etc.).
- **Wrap with context** using `fmt.Errorf("doing X: %w", err)`. The `%w` verb preserves the chain for `errors.Is` / `errors.As`.
- **Define sentinel errors** at the package level for known conditions: `var ErrNotFound = errors.New("not found")`.
- **Define error types** when callers need structured info: `type ValidationError struct { Field string; Reason string }`.
- **Don't log and return.** Pick one. Logging at every layer creates noise; log once at the top (handler boundary).
- **Don't ignore errors with `_`** unless you've written a comment explaining why.
- **Check errors immediately**, on the line after the call. Never let an error variable live across multiple statements.

```go
// ❌ Bad
result, err := svc.Fetch(ctx, id)
log.Printf("fetch failed: %v", err)
return nil, err

// ✅ Good — at service layer, just wrap
result, err := svc.Fetch(ctx, id)
if err != nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("fetch user %s: %w", id, err)
}
```

---

## 5. Context (`context.Context`) Conventions

- **`ctx` is always the first parameter** of any function that does I/O, blocks, or might be cancelled.
- **Never store `ctx` in a struct field.** Pass it through explicitly.
- **Never pass `nil` context.** Use `context.TODO()` if you genuinely don't have one yet (and add a comment).
- **`context.Value` is for request-scoped data only** (request ID, auth user, trace span). Not for optional parameters.
- Use **typed keys** for context values to avoid collisions:

    ```go
    type ctxKey struct{ name string }
    var userKey = ctxKey{"user"}
    ```

- Always **honor cancellation**: check `ctx.Done()` in loops, pass `ctx` down to every downstream call.

---

## 6. Dependency Injection Patterns

Go DI is **constructor injection**. No frameworks required.

### Pattern A: Plain constructor (preferred for ≤4 deps)

```go
type Handler struct {
    repo   UserRepo
    mailer Mailer
    logger Logger
}

func NewHandler(repo UserRepo, mailer Mailer, logger Logger) *Handler {
    return &Handler{repo: repo, mailer: mailer, logger: logger}
}
```

### Pattern B: Options struct (when ≥5 deps or many optional)

```go
type HandlerOptions struct {
    Repo    UserRepo
    Mailer  Mailer
    Logger  Logger
    Metrics MetricsEmitter // optional
}

func NewHandler(opts HandlerOptions) *Handler { ... }
```

### Pattern C: Functional options (for libraries with many optional knobs)

```go
func NewHandler(repo UserRepo, opts ...Option) *Handler { ... }
```

### Rules

- **Wire dependencies in `main.go` or a single `wire.go` / `bootstrap.go`.** This is the only place concrete types meet.
- **Accept interfaces, return concrete types.** This lets callers narrow what they depend on.
- **No global state.** Inject databases/services. (Exception: global state is acceptable/good for client, handler, and configuration if they are immutable).
- **No service locator pattern.** No `container.Get("UserService")`.

## Review Workflow

When asked to review Go code:

1. Run `git diff --name-only` (if in a repo) to scope changes, otherwise read the file/package the user pointed to.
2. Walk through the checklist below and produce findings organized by severity.
3. For each finding: cite the file and line, explain WHY it's a problem (link to the principle), and show the fix.

## Review Checklist

**🔴 Critical (must fix)**

- Cyclic imports between packages
- Business logic in `service/` or `model/`
- Concrete types injected instead of interfaces
- Missing context propagation in I/O paths
- Errors swallowed (`_ = err`) without justification
- `panic` used for recoverable conditions

**🟡 Warnings (should fix)**

- Fat interfaces (>3 methods unless genuinely cohesive)
- Interfaces defined in the producer package instead of consumer
- Generic package names (`util`, `common`, `helpers`)
- Stutter in naming (`user.UserService`)
- Errors returned without `%w` wrapping
- Validators with non-descriptive names
- Constants not using `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

**🟢 Suggestions (consider)**

- Functions exceeding ~50 lines (signal of mixed responsibilities)
- Structs with >7 fields (consider splitting)
- Repeated `if err != nil` blocks that could become a helper
- Magic numbers/strings that should be named constants

## Output Format

Always structure findings like this:

```text
🔴 CRITICAL — handler/user.go:42
Issue: Direct DB query in handler bypasses service layer
Why: Violates layered architecture — handler should orchestrate, not access storage
Fix:
  // before
  rows, err := h.db.Query("SELECT ...")
  // after
  user, err := h.userSvc.GetByID(ctx, id)
```

Be specific, cite line numbers, and show the diff. Never say "this could be improved" without showing how.

## When generating new code

- Start by sketching the package layout and interface boundaries before writing implementations.
- Generate one package at a time, top-down: `model/` → `service/` → `handler/` → wiring in `main.go`.
- Every exported function gets a doc comment starting with the function name (`// NewHandler returns ...`).
- Prefer returning early. Avoid nesting beyond 2 levels.

## When refactoring

- Identify the violation, name the principle being broken, propose the smallest change that fixes it.
- Preserve external behavior. Refactors are not feature changes.
- Suggest one refactor at a time when multiple exist; let the user prioritize.
