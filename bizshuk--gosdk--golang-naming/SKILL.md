# golang-naming

A Go naming convention reviewer and safe renamer workflow.

## Hard rules

1. **Invocation context matters.** When invoked as a standalone skill (not by a parent agent), confirm intent with the user before proceeding. When invoked by a parent agent (e.g., `golang-refactor`, `feature`), proceed directly — the parent agent has already determined the need.
2. **Two-phase: report → approval → apply.** Never rename anything without explicit per-batch user approval. Default to dry-run.
3. **`gopls rename` is the only renaming mechanism.** Never use Edit/sed/grep-replace to rename Go symbols. Textual replacement is forbidden because it cannot resolve Go scope, interface satisfaction, or cross-package references.
4. **Refuse non-Go files.** If asked to review `.py`, `.ts`, IDL, YAML, etc., decline and explain that this skill is Go-only.
5. **Skip generated and vendored code.** Exclude any file matching:
    - Contains header `// Code generated ... DO NOT EDIT.`
    - Under `vendor/`, `kitex_gen/`, `hertz_gen/`, `thrift_gen/`, `pb_gen/`, `mock/` (auto-generated mocks), `*_mock.go` (mockey-generated)
    - Path components matching `\.pb\.go$`, `_gen\.go$`

## Prerequisite check (run first, every invocation)

```bash
command -v gopls >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "gopls not installed"; exit 1; }
gopls version
```

If `gopls` is missing, stop and instruct the user to install:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
```

Also verify you are at a Go module root (presence of `go.mod`). If not, ask the user to point you at the correct directory.

## Scope

- **Default**: the entire current Go workspace (every package in `go.mod`'s module).
- Enumerate `.go` files with `find . -name '*.go' -not -path './vendor/*' -not -path './kitex_gen/*' -not -path './hertz_gen/*'` (extend exclusions as needed) and filter out generated/mock files by reading their first 5 lines.
- If the user specifies a path/package, narrow to that subtree but keep the _rename impact analysis_ workspace-wide (gopls handles that automatically).

## Naming rules to enforce

Apply these idioms (Effective Go + Google Go Style Guide + community consensus):

| #   | Rule                                                                                                                                                      | Bad                                                           | Good                                                                                 |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **No stutter** between package and exported name                                                                                                          | `region.RegionManager`, `user.UserService`                    | `region.Manager`, `user.Service`                                                     |
| 2   | **Acronyms in full caps** for ID/URL/API/HTTP/JSON/XML/SQL/TCC/IDC/PSM/RPC/IDL/UUID                                                                       | `userId`, `httpUrl`, `tccConfig`                              | `userID`, `httpURL`, `tccConfig` (TCC is already caps; flag `Tcc`/`tcc` mixed cases) |
| 3   | **Receiver names short** (1–3 lowercase letters), consistent across all methods of the same type                                                          | `func (this *UserService)`, `func (userService *UserService)` | `func (s *UserService)` (consistently `s`)                                           |
| 4   | **Exported vs unexported casing** correct relative to intended visibility                                                                                 | unused-outside-package `Helper`                               | `helper`                                                                             |
| 5   | **Verb-first for functions/methods that perform actions**                                                                                                 | `UserGet`, `ConfigLoad`                                       | `GetUser`, `LoadConfig`                                                              |
| 6   | **No redundant suffixes** on functions                                                                                                                    | `GetUserFunc`, `ValidateMethod`                               | `GetUser`, `Validate`                                                                |
| 7   | **No redundant type suffixes** on struct names when context already conveys it                                                                            | `UserStruct`, `OptionsType`                                   | `User`, `Options`                                                                    |
| 8   | **Avoid unclear abbreviations**; prefer clarity over brevity for package-level names. Short names are OK inside short scopes (loop variables, receivers). | package-level `cfg`, `mgr`, `ctx` field                       | `config`, `manager` (keep `ctx` for `context.Context`, `err` for errors)             |
| 9   | **Boolean names read as predicates**: `is/has/can/should` prefix                                                                                          | `enable`, `success` (as flag)                                 | `isEnabled`, `hasSucceeded`                                                          |
| 10  | **Interface naming**: single-method interfaces use `-er` suffix; multi-method use noun. `I` prefix is allowed.                                            | `ReadInterface`                                               | `Reader`; for multi-method something like `Store`; `IReader` is acceptable           |
| 11  | **Errors**: variables start with `Err`, types end with `Error`                                                                                            | `NotFound` (error sentinel)                                   | `ErrNotFound`, `NotFoundError` (type)                                                |
| 12  | **Constants**: use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (all caps with underscores). This is a deliberate team convention.                                              | `MixedCase` constants                                         | `MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`, `COLOR_RED`                                        |
| 13  | **Use `any` instead of `interface{}`** (Go 1.18+ style)                                                                                                   | `interface{}`, `map[string]interface{}`                       | `any`, `map[string]any`                                                              |

Tailor to the project: if the codebase already uses a documented convention (e.g. CLAUDE.md says X), defer to it and call out conflicts in the report.

**External code is out of scope**: symbols defined outside this workspace (e.g. in `kitex_gen/`, `thrift_gen/`, vendor packages, or upstream IDL-generated types) are not reviewed and must not be renamed.

## Package naming rules

Source: [Go blog — "Package names"](https://go.dev/blog/package-names) (Sameer Ajmani). Package identifiers deserve their own pass because a package name is a prefix on _every_ exported symbol it contains; fixing the package name often dissolves a pile of stutter-rule violations at once. Evaluate package names from the _caller's_ point of view — write a line of client code using the package and see if it reads well.

| #   | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Bad                                                              | Good                                                                                         |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P1  | **Short, lowercase, single word.** No `under_scores`, no `mixedCaps`, no plurals. Usually a simple noun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `package httpUtils`, `package string_set`, `package models`      | `package http`, `package stringset`, `package model`                                         |
| P2  | **Abbreviate only when the abbreviation is unambiguous and widely understood.** Mirrors stdlib (`fmt`, `strconv`, `syscall`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `package srvmgr`, `package cfgldr`                               | `package server`, `package config` (or a clear abbrev with precedent)                        |
| P3  | **Don't steal good variable names.** If clients will want the bare word as a local variable, give the package a different name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `package buf` (clients want `buf := ...`)                        | `package bufio`                                                                              |
| P4  | **No grab-bag packages.** `util`, `common`, `helpers`, `misc`, `shared`, `base` give zero information, attract unrelated deps, and collide on import. Split by what the code _does_.                                                                                                                                                                | `package util` with `NewStringSet`, `ParseJSON`, `RetryHTTP`     | `package stringset`, `package jsonconfig`, `package httpretry`                               |
| P5  | **No mega-packages either.** A single `types`, `api`, `interfaces`, or `dto` package that holds everything has the same problems as `util`. Use `model` (singular) as the default package for domain types, unless there are more than 30 models, in which case group types with the code that operates on them, or split into focused subpackages. | `package types` (300 structs)                                    | `package order`, `package payment`, `package inventory`, or `package model` (if <=30 models) |
| P6  | **Avoid colliding with popular stdlib / well-known package names** unless the domain truly demands it (forces every importer to alias).                                                                                                                                                                                                             | local `package context`, `package http`, `package io`            | `package requestctx`, `package httpx` (only if a distinct name is genuinely needed)          |
| P7  | **The last path element is the package name.** Don't let `import "…/foo/v2bar"` declare `package bar`, and don't repeat the parent dir (`server/serverhttp` → `server/http` declaring `package http`).                                                                                                                                              | dir `stringutil/` declaring `package strutil`                    | dir `stringset/` declaring `package stringset`                                               |
| P8  | **Package contents don't repeat the package name.** This is the package-side mirror of symbol Rule 1 (no stutter). `New` in package `pkg` should return `pkg.Pkg` / `*pkg.Pkg`; use a typed name (`NewTicker → *time.Ticker`) only when the returned type isn't the package's namesake.                                                             | `chain.NewChain()`, `http.HTTPServer`, `stringset.SortStringSet` | `chain.New()`, `http.Server`, `(stringset.Set).Sort()`                                       |

**Worked refactor (from the blog):** a `package util` exposing `util.NewStringSet(...)` / `util.SortStringSet(set)` becomes `package stringset` exposing `type Set`, `stringset.New(...)`, and a `(Set).Sort()` method — shorter call sites, no stutter, a name that says what it is.

**Caveats specific to this skill:**

- **Renaming a package is heavier than renaming a symbol.** It means renaming the _directory_, updating the `package` clause in every file, and rewriting every import path across the workspace (and possibly downstream modules). `gopls rename` _can_ rename a package when invoked on a `package` clause, but verify the result with `go build ./...` and a `grep -rn` for the old import path afterward. Treat any package rename as higher-risk than a symbol rename and call it out prominently in the report.
- **External / generated package names are out of scope** — never propose renaming `kitex_gen`, `hertz_gen`, `thrift_gen`, vendored packages, or `main`.
- **Test packages**: a `foo_test` external-test package is intentional, not a violation — don't flag the `_test` suffix.
- If a package name is bad but the _right_ fix is structural (split a `util` into several focused packages), don't try to automate it — describe the recommended split in the report and leave it for the user, since `gopls rename` can't restructure packages.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Inventory

1. Run prerequisite check.
2. Enumerate target `.go` files (after generated/vendor exclusion).
3. Build the **package list**: `go list ./...` (or, grouped by directory, the set of `package` clauses in the kept files). Each distinct package is a candidate for the package-naming pass (rules P1–P8).
4. Use `gopls workspace_symbol` or AST scan via `go doc`/`grep` for exported declarations to build a symbol candidate list. For non-exported, scan with regex like `^\s*(func|type|var|const)\s+([A-Za-z_]\w*)`.
5. Build a TodoWrite list with one item per rule pass (symbol rules 1–13 plus a "package names (P1–P8)" pass) so progress is visible to the user.

### Step 2 — Analyze & propose

First do the **package-naming pass** (rules P1–P8): for each package, write a one-line client-side usage example and judge it; if a package name is bad, decide whether the fix is a _rename_ (mechanical — note the `package` clause site `file:line:col`) or a _restructure_ (e.g. splitting `util`), and if the latter, describe it for the report rather than automating it. Then, for each candidate symbol:

- Identify the rule it violates (if any). A symbol may pass — skip silently.
- Determine the proposed new name.
- Capture the **definition site** `file:line:col` (needed for `gopls rename`). Use Grep with `-n` and compute column from the line content (column of the first character of the identifier).
- Estimate scope of change by running `gopls references file:line:col` (or fall back to `grep -rn '\bOldName\b'` for an upper-bound count — note this overestimates because it cannot distinguish same-named symbols in other scopes).
- Skip if the symbol is exported AND the package is consumed by other modules outside this workspace (would be a breaking API change) — flag separately under a "BREAKING — needs human decision" section.

### Step 3 — Report

Output a single markdown report in this exact shape:

```markdown
# golang-naming review — <module path>

Scope: <N> files, <M> packages scanned (excluded: <list>)
gopls: <version>

## Package names (<count>)

### Renameable (mechanical)

| #   | Package | `package` clause at       | New name    | Import path now → after                        | Importers | Notes                     |
| --- | ------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| P1  | `util`  | internal/util/util.go:1:9 | `stringset` | `.../internal/util` → `.../internal/stringset` | 12        | also rename the directory |

### Restructure recommended (manual — not automated)

| Package | Problem (rule)  | Suggested split                 |
| ------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `types` | P5 mega-package | `order`, `payment`, `inventory` |

## Proposed renames (<count>)

### Rule 1 — No stutter

| #   | Symbol                 | Defined at            | New name         | References | Notes    |
| --- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1   | `region.RegionManager` | config/region.go:14:6 | `region.Manager` | 23         | exported |

...

### Rule 2 — Acronym casing

...

## BREAKING — manual decision needed (<count>)

Exported symbols or package import paths whose rename would change the public API.

| Symbol / package | Reason | Suggestion |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------- |

## Skipped

Files excluded (generated/vendored): <count>
Symbols already conforming: <count>

---

**Next step**: reply with one of:

- `apply all` — execute every proposed rename
- `apply 1,3,5-7` — execute selected items (comma list, ranges allowed)
- `apply rule 2` — execute one rule's batch
- `apply P1` — execute a package rename
- `cancel` — exit without changes
```

### Step 4 — Apply (only after explicit approval)

For each approved item:

```bash
gopls rename -w <file>:<line>:<col> <NewName>
```

For an approved **package rename** (P-items), invoke `gopls rename -w` on the `package` clause position:

```bash
gopls rename -w <file>:1:9 <newpkgname>   # col 9 == first char after "package "
```

`gopls` rewrites the `package` clause in every file of the package _and_ every import path workspace-wide. It does **not** rename the directory — do that yourself afterward (`git mv internal/util internal/stringset`) so the path's last element matches the new package name (rule P7), then re-run `go build ./...`. Do package renames _before_ symbol renames in the same package (the symbol positions shift less that way), and one package at a time. For _restructure_ recommendations, do nothing — they were reported, not approved for automation.

Important details:

- Run renames **sequentially**, not in parallel (line/col offsets shift after each rename).
- After **each** rename, re-resolve the next item's `file:line:col` if it's in the same file (a previous rename may have shifted line numbers).
- A simpler robust strategy: between renames, re-run Grep to confirm the new definition position still matches before applying the next.

After all renames in a batch:

```bash
go build ./... 2>&1 | tail -50
go vet ./... 2>&1 | tail -50
```

Report build/vet results. If build fails, surface the error and stop — do not attempt further renames.

### Step 5 — Wrap-up

Output a concise summary:

- N symbol renames applied successfully
- N package renames applied (plus directory moves done / pending)
- M failed (with error)
- Build status: pass/fail
- Restructure recommendations the user still needs to act on (e.g. split `util`)
- Suggested follow-ups (e.g. update CHANGELOG, regenerate mocks if any rename touched a mocked interface, fix any import paths in non-Go files)

## Edge cases

- **Method on an interface**: `gopls rename` automatically renames all implementations. Verify with `gopls implementations` first and report the count to the user before applying.
- **Symbol used in struct tags or reflection (`reflect.TypeOf(x).Field(i).Name`)**: `gopls` will NOT update these. Grep for the old name in `.go` string literals as a safety check after rename; surface any remaining hits to the user.
- **Symbol referenced in tests via build tags or `//go:build` constraints**: gopls handles these as long as the build constraints allow loading; if not, warn the user.
- **Generated code that references the renamed symbol**: e.g. kitex_gen handlers. These should be regenerated, not edited. Flag this in the report and suggest the user re-run codegen after rename.
- **Package rename ≠ directory rename**: `gopls` updates `package` clauses and import paths but not the folder name. Always follow a package rename with the matching `git mv` so the path's last element equals the package name (rule P7), then rebuild. Conversely, never propose a package rename for `main` packages, generated-code packages, or `_test` external test packages.
- **Import path appearing in non-Go files**: build scripts, `//go:generate` directives, Bazel `BUILD` files, Dockerfiles, docs. `gopls` won't touch these — `grep -rn` the old path after a package rename and surface remaining hits.

## Refusal templates

- Non-Go file: `"golang-naming reviews Go source only. The file <path> is <ext>. Please point me at .go files."`
- gopls missing: `"gopls is not installed. Install with: go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest"`
- Standalone invocation without clear intent: `"golang-naming was invoked outside a parent agent context. Did you mean to run a naming review? If yes, please confirm with 'run golang-naming review'."`

## Anti-patterns you must avoid

- Using `sed`, `Edit`, or `grep -l ... | xargs sed` to rename Go symbols or import paths — **forbidden**.
- Applying renames before showing the report.
- Renaming exported symbols, or changing a package's import path, for a package consumed outside this workspace without flagging as breaking.
- Trying to automate a `util`/`common`/`types` _split_ — only propose it; restructuring isn't a rename.
- Renaming a package but forgetting the matching directory `git mv` (leaves path ≠ package name).
- Batching renames in parallel (offsets shift).
- Skipping the post-rename `go build ./...` verification.
