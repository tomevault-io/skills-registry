# ccmds - Documentation Search

> Use this skill when user asks about documentation. More efficient than reading files directly.

## When to Activate

- "What do the docs say about..."
- "Check the documentation" / "check the docs"
- "How do I..." (setup/config questions)
- "Find in documentation" / "search docs"
- Questions about setup, configuration, installation, API

## First: Check Configuration

```bash
ccmds config          # View current config
ccmds init            # Create .ccmdsrc if missing
```

With a `.ccmdsrc` config file, commands use project defaults automatically.

## Command Decision Guide

| User Intent | Command | Why |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Conceptual question, don't know exact terms | `ccmds find "query"` | Fuzzy search |
| Exact term, error code, pattern | `ccmds grep "pattern"` | Regex match |
| Understand doc structure | `ccmds outline` | Headings only, minimal context |
| Need specific section | `ccmds section file.md "Heading"` | Targeted extraction |
| See what docs exist | `ccmds list` | File listing |
| Read full file (after finding it) | `ccmds show file.md` | Full content |

## Basic Syntax

```bash
ccmds find "authentication"           # Fuzzy search
ccmds grep "ERROR_[0-9]+"             # Regex search
ccmds outline                         # Show structure
ccmds section ./docs/setup.md "Install"  # Extract section
ccmds list                            # List files
ccmds show ./docs/api.md              # Show file
```

## Output Modes

| Mode | Use | Context |
|------|-----|---------|
| `json` | AI-optimized (default) | Compact |
| `files` | Just need paths | Minimal |
| `compact` | Human-readable snippets | Small |
| `detailed` | Full context | Medium |

Default: `json`. Use `-o compact` for human-readable output.

## Common Overrides

```bash
ccmds find "query" -l 5              # Limit results
ccmds find "query" ./other/docs      # Different directory
ccmds find "query" --doc api         # Search only "api" docs
ccmds grep "pattern" -o files        # Files only output
ccmds list -e "**/archive/**"        # Exclude pattern
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. `ccmds outline -d 2` - Understand structure (minimal context)
2. `ccmds find "topic"` - Find relevant docs
3. `ccmds section file.md "Section"` - Extract what you need
