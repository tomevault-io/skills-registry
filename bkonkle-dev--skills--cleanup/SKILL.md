# Cleanup

Clean up the current repository after finishing a task. Prunes stale branches, checks for
uncommitted or unpushed work, and checks for unfinalized session memories.

**Multi-agent safety:** Multiple agents may be running in parallel via worktrees. This skill only
cleans up resources belonging to the **current session** and never touches branches or worktrees
owned by other active sessions.

## Prerequisites

- You must be inside a git repository.

## Detecting Context

1. **Session name:** Extract from `$PWD`. If the path contains `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` or
   `.codex/worktrees/<name>/`, use
   `<name>`. Otherwise, use `$(basename "$PWD")`.
2. **Repo root:** Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
3. **Current branch:** Run `git branch --show-current`.
4. **Active worktree branches:** List all branches checked out in any worktree. These are
   **off-limits** for deletion:

   ```sh
   git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^branch / {sub("refs/heads/", "", $2); print $2}'
   ```

   Store this list for use during branch pruning.

## Steps

### 1. Check for uncommitted and unpushed work

1. **Uncommitted changes:** Run `git status --porcelain`. If output is non-empty, **warn the user**
   and list the dirty files. Do NOT discard changes — the user must decide what to do.
2. **Unpushed commits:** Run `git log --oneline @{u}..HEAD 2>/dev/null`. If output is non-empty,
   **warn the user** that there are unpushed commits. Do NOT push — the user must decide.

If there are uncommitted changes or unpushed commits, **stop and ask the user** how to proceed
before continuing. Do not silently skip warnings.

### 2. Prune stale local branches

1. **Fetch and prune remote tracking refs:**

   ```sh
   git fetch --prune 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. **Find branches whose upstream is gone:** List local branches where the upstream tracking branch
   no longer exists on the remote:

   ```sh
   git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream:track)' refs/heads/ \
     | awk '$2 == "[gone]" {print $1}'
   ```

3. **Find branches already merged into the default branch:** Determine the default branch
   (`main` or `master`) and list merged branches:

   ```sh
   default=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||')
   [ -z "$default" ] && default="main"
   git branch --merged "origin/$default" --format='%(refname:short)' \
     | grep -v "^${default}$"
   ```

4. **Triage and delete stale branches:** Combine the two lists (dedup). For each candidate branch,
   run the following checks before deleting. Track skipped branches and their reasons for the
   summary.

   **a. Skip worktree-checked-out branches** — if the branch appears in the active worktree
   branches list (from "Detecting Context" step 4), **skip** it (reason: "checked out in a
   worktree"). This protects branches used by other parallel agents. Never attempt to delete a
   branch that is checked out in any worktree.

   **b. Check for open PRs** — query GitHub to see if the branch has an open pull request:

   ```sh
   repo_slug=$(git remote get-url origin | sed -E 's|.*github\.com[:/]||; s|\.git$||')
   open_prs=$(gh pr list --repo "$repo_slug" --head "<branch>" --state open --json number --jq 'length')
   ```

   If `open_prs > 0`, **skip** the branch (reason: "has open PR").

   **c. Delete if safe** — only if all checks above pass:

   - For **gone-upstream branches** (from step 2.2), use `-D` since the remote already deleted the
     tracking branch:

     ```sh
     git branch -D <branch>
     ```

   - For **merged branches** (from step 2.3 only), use `-d` which is safe since git confirms they
     are fully merged:

     ```sh
     git branch -d <branch>
     ```

   Report each deleted branch. If no stale branches are found, note that the repo is clean.

5. **Handle the current session's branch:** If the current branch is a candidate for deletion
   (merged or gone-upstream) and you need to switch away from it:

   **Worktree context (primary path):** If `$PWD` contains `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` or
   `.codex/worktrees/<name>/`, return to the worktree's designated branch
   (`claude/<name>` or `codex/<name>`) instead of the default branch. Never switch
   to the default branch in a worktree — it will fail if that branch is checked out elsewhere:

   ```sh
   runtime=$(echo "$PWD" | sed -n 's|.*/\.\(claude\|codex\)/worktrees/.*|\1|p')
   worktree_name=$(echo "$PWD" | sed -n 's|.*/\.\(claude\|codex\)/worktrees/\([^/]*\)\(/.*\)\{0,1\}$|\2|p')
   if [ -n "$worktree_name" ]; then
     git switch "${runtime}/${worktree_name}"
   else
     git switch <default>
   fi
   ```

   **Non-worktree context (fallback):** Switch to the default branch (`git switch <default>`).

   If `git switch` fails for any reason (branch doesn't exist, checked out elsewhere), **skip**
   the current branch (reason: "cannot switch away — delete after worktree is removed or branch
   is freed") and continue with the remaining candidates.

### 3. Check for stale stashes

```sh
git stash list
```

If stashes exist, **warn the user** and triage each stash before applying or opening a rescue PR.
Stash replay can overwrite newer work on `origin/$default`.

For each stash (`stash@{n}`):

1. Collect changed files (including untracked):
   ```sh
   git stash show --name-status --include-untracked "stash@{n}"
   ```
2. Compute stash base commit/time:
   ```sh
   stash_base=$(git rev-parse "stash@{n}^1")
   stash_base_ts=$(git show -s --format=%ct "$stash_base")
   ```
3. For each changed file, classify:
   - **obsolete**: stash blob equals `origin/$default` blob
   - **stale**: `origin/$default` touched the file after `stash_base_ts`
   - **regressive**: stash would delete content that exists on `origin/$default`
   - **safe**: none of the above

If any stash has `stale` or `regressive` files, **stop and ask the user** before restoring anything.
Do not auto-create PRs from stale/regressive stash content.

For a safe/manual stash rescue flow, use a dedicated branch and PR:

```sh
USERNAME=$(gh api user --jq .login 2>/dev/null || echo "agent")
rescue_branch="${USERNAME}/rescue-stash-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
git switch -c "$rescue_branch" "origin/$default"
git stash show --name-only --include-untracked "stash@{n}" | while read -r file; do
  [ -n "$file" ] && git checkout "stash@{n}" -- "$file"
done
git stash show --name-only --include-untracked "stash@{n}" | while read -r file; do
  [ -n "$file" ] && git add -- "$file"
done
git commit -m "docs: rescue intended stash content from stash@{n}"
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "docs: rescue stash content (stash@{n})" \
  --body "Rescues intentionally retained stash content after stale/regressive triage."
```

### 4. Check for orphaned session memories on stale branches

Before deleting branches, check if any contain session memory files that never made it to main.
This prevents losing session memories that were committed to worktree branches but not included
in the merged PR.

```sh
repo_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
default=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||')
[ -z "$default" ] && default="main"
```

For each branch that is a candidate for deletion (from step 2), check for branch-unique orphaned
session memories:

```sh
unique_commits=$(git rev-list --count "origin/$default..<branch>")
if [ "$unique_commits" -eq 0 ]; then
  orphaned=""
else
  orphaned=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR "origin/$default" "<branch>" -- docs/agent-sessions/ 2>/dev/null)
fi
```

If orphaned session memories are found on a branch about to be deleted:

1. **WARN** the user: "Branch `<branch>` has session memory files not present on `$default`:
   `<list of files>`. These will be lost if the branch is deleted."

2. **Offer to rescue** them by cherry-picking to a rescue branch:
   ```sh
   USERNAME=$(gh api user --jq .login 2>/dev/null || echo "agent")
   rescue_branch="${USERNAME}/rescue-session-memory-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
   git switch -c "$rescue_branch" "origin/$default"
   printf '%s\n' "$orphaned" | while read -r file; do
     [ -n "$file" ] && git checkout <branch> -- "$file"
   done
   printf '%s\n' "$orphaned" | while read -r file; do
     [ -n "$file" ] && git add -- "$file"
   done
   git commit -m "docs: rescue stranded session memories from branch <branch>"
   git push -u origin HEAD
   gh pr create --title "docs: rescue stranded session memories" \
     --body "Rescues session memory files that were stranded on branch \`<branch>\` after its PR merged."
   ```

3. Only proceed with branch deletion after session memories are rescued or the user explicitly
   confirms they can be discarded.

### 5. Finalize session memory (if applicable)

Check whether a session memory directory exists for the current session and today's date:

```sh
ls -d "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/docs/agent-sessions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-"*/ 2>/dev/null
```

If a session directory exists and has not been finalized (contains HTML comment placeholders in
`memory.md`), remind the user to run `/session-memory finalize` before cleaning up.

### 6. Print summary

Display:

- **Session:** name (from worktree or directory)
- **Active worktrees:** count of other active worktrees detected (so the user knows parallel agents
  exist)
- **Stale branches deleted** — list each, or "none" if all clean
- **Branches skipped** — list each with its reason ("checked out in a worktree", "has open PR").
  Omit this bullet entirely if nothing was skipped.
- **Branch freshness** — how many commits behind `origin/<default>` the current branch is. If > 0,
  suggest rebasing before the next task:
  `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/<default>`
- **Warnings** — any uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, or unfinalized session memories (this
  section only appears if there are warnings). Include stale/regressive stash triage results here.
- **Status** — "ready for next task"
