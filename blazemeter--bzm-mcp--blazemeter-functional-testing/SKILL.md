# BlazeMeter Functional Testing

Comprehensive guide for creating and managing Functional Tests in BlazeMeter.

## Overview

Functional Testing in BlazeMeter supports GUI Functional Tests with scriptless creation, YAML upload, and IDE-based development. This skill covers test creation, management, debugging, and browser support.

## Quick Start

1. **GUI Tests**: Create tests using scriptless UI, YAML files, or IDEs
2. **Test Data**: Use test data in Functional Tests
3. **Action Library**: Manage shared Objects and Group Actions
4. **Debugging**: Debug tests using best practices
5. **Browsers**: Understand browser support and selection

## MCP Tools Integration

Functional Tests are managed through the BlazeMeter UI, but you can use MCP tools to manage tests and executions:

### Available MCP Tools

- **Test Management**: 
  - `blazemeter_tests` with action `read` - Read test details including functional test configuration
  - `blazemeter_tests` with action `list` - List all tests in a project
  - Required args: `test_id` (integer) or `project_id` (integer)
  - Returns: Test details including functional test configuration

- **Test Execution**:
  - `blazemeter_execution` with action `read` - Read execution details for functional tests
  - `blazemeter_execution` with action `list` - List all executions for a test
  - Required args: `execution_id` (integer) or `test_id` (integer)
  - Returns: Execution details and results

### When to Use MCP Tools

- **Test Management**: Manage functional tests programmatically
- **Execution Monitoring**: Monitor functional test executions
- **Automation**: Integrate functional testing into automation workflows
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on functional test results

### Example Workflow

**Managing Functional Tests**:
1. Use `blazemeter_tests` with action `list` to find functional tests
2. Use `blazemeter_tests` with action `read` to get test details
3. Use `blazemeter_execution` with action `read` to monitor test execution
4. Review execution results for functional test outcomes

## Reference Files

### GUI Tests
- **[gui-tests.md](skill-blazemeter-functional-testing://references/gui-tests.md)**: Overview, Create YAML File, Create from Java IDE, Create from Python IDE, Report, Duplicate/Delete/Move/Rename Test, Test Data, Parameterize Taurus YAML Scripts, Desired Capabilities Options, Custom JavaScript Actions, Taurus Actions Scriptless

### API Tests (Deprecated)
- **[api-tests.md](skill-blazemeter-functional-testing://references/api-tests.md)**: Create, Report, Scripting in UI, Create from Existing Script. **Note: This feature is deprecated. Use API Monitoring instead.**

### Action Library
- **[action-library.md](skill-blazemeter-functional-testing://references/action-library.md)**: Test Action Library, Management

### Debugging
- **[debugging.md](skill-blazemeter-functional-testing://references/debugging.md)**: Debug Best Practices

### Browsers
- **[browsers.md](skill-blazemeter-functional-testing://references/browsers.md)**: Supported Browsers

## When to Use Each Reference

- **GUI Tests**: When creating, managing, or reporting on GUI Functional Tests
- **API Tests**: When working with deprecated API Functional Tests (use API Monitoring instead)
- **Action Library**: When managing shared test components
- **Debugging**: When debugging Functional Tests
- **Browsers**: When understanding browser support and selection
