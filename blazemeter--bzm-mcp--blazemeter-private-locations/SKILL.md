# BlazeMeter Private Locations

Comprehensive guide for installing, configuring, and managing Private Locations in BlazeMeter.

## Overview

Private Locations enable running BlazeMeter tests from your own infrastructure, providing control over test execution environment and network access. This skill covers Radar Agent, installation methods, configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Quick Start

1. **Installation**: Choose Docker, Kubernetes, or Helm Chart installation
2. **Radar Agent**: Configure for API Monitoring private API access
3. **Configuration**: Set environment variables, certificates, and proxy settings
4. **Management**: Create, use, and manage private locations and agents
5. **Troubleshooting**: Resolve installation, connectivity, and resource issues

## MCP Tools Integration

Private Locations are managed through the BlazeMeter UI, but you can use MCP tools to manage tests that use private locations:

### Available MCP Tools

- **Test Management**: 
  - `blazemeter_tests` with action `read` - Read test details including private location configuration
  - `blazemeter_tests` with action `list` - List all tests in a project
  - Required args: `test_id` (integer) or `project_id` (integer)
  - Returns: Test details including private location selection

- **Test Execution**:
  - `blazemeter_execution` with action `read` - Read execution details for tests using private locations
  - `blazemeter_execution` with action `list` - List all executions for a test
  - Required args: `execution_id` (integer) or `test_id` (integer)
  - Returns: Execution details and results

### When to Use MCP Tools

- **Test Management**: Manage tests that use private locations programmatically
- **Execution Monitoring**: Monitor test executions on private locations
- **Automation**: Integrate private location testing into automation workflows
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on tests using private locations

### Example Workflow

**Managing Tests with Private Locations**:
1. Use `blazemeter_tests` with action `list` to find tests using private locations
2. Use `blazemeter_tests` with action `read` to get test details and private location configuration
3. Use `blazemeter_execution` with action `read` to monitor test execution
4. Review execution results to verify private location usage
