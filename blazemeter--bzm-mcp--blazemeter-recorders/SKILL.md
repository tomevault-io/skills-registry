# BlazeMeter Recorders

Comprehensive guide for recording performance and functional tests in BlazeMeter.

## Overview

BlazeMeter provides two main recording options: Chrome Extension for browser-based recording and Proxy Recorder for mobile and web app recording. This skill covers both recording methods and their configuration.

## Quick Start

1. **Chrome Extension**: Record tests directly from Chrome browser
2. **Proxy Recorder**: Record mobile and web app traffic via proxy
3. **Configuration**: Configure browsers and devices for proxy recording

## MCP Tools Integration

While recording is primarily done through browser extensions and proxy configuration, you can use BlazeMeter MCP tools to manage tests created from recordings:

### Available MCP Tools

- **Test Management**: 
  - `blazemeter_tests` with action `read` - Read test details for tests created from recordings
  - `blazemeter_tests` with action `list` - List all tests in a project, including recorded tests
  - Required args: `test_id` (integer) or `project_id` (integer)
  - Returns: Test details including configuration and scripts

- **Test Execution**:
  - `blazemeter_execution` with action `read` - Read execution details for recorded tests
  - `blazemeter_execution` with action `list` - List all executions for a recorded test
  - Required args: `execution_id` (integer) or `test_id` (integer)
  - Returns: Execution details and results

### When to Use MCP Tools

- **Test Management**: Manage tests created from recordings programmatically
- **Execution Monitoring**: Monitor execution of recorded tests
- **Automation**: Integrate recorded tests into automation workflows

### Example Workflow

**Managing Recorded Tests**:
1. Record test using Chrome Extension or Proxy Recorder
2. Export recorded script to BlazeMeter
3. Use `blazemeter_tests` with action `list` to find the created test
4. Use `blazemeter_tests` with action `read` to get test details
5. Use `blazemeter_execution` to monitor test execution
