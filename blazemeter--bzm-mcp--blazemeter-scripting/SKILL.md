description: Comprehensive guide for BlazeMeter Scripting, including Groovy/Beanshell, JMeter plugins, JMeter DSL, and API Monitoring scripting. Use when working with scripting for (1) Writing files in Groovy/Beanshell scripts, (2) Using non-standard JMeter plugins, (3) Creating JMeter tests with JMeter DSL, (4) Writing custom scripts for API Monitoring (custom libraries, included libraries, initial script, reusable snippets), or any other scripting tasks. Use when this capability is needed.

# BlazeMeter Scripting

Comprehensive guide for scripting in BlazeMeter tests.

## Overview

Scripting in BlazeMeter supports Groovy/Beanshell for Performance tests, JMeter DSL for code-based test creation, and JavaScript for API Monitoring. This skill covers all scripting capabilities.

## Quick Start

1. **Groovy/Beanshell**: Write files and custom logic in Performance tests
2. **JMeter Plugins**: Use non-standard JMeter plugins
3. **JMeter DSL**: Create JMeter tests as code
4. **API Monitoring Scripting**: Write custom JavaScript for API Monitoring

## MCP Tools Integration

While scripting is primarily done through test configuration and code, you can use BlazeMeter MCP tools to manage tests that use custom scripts:

### Available MCP Tools

- **Test Management**: 
  - `blazemeter_tests` with action `read` - Read test details including script configuration
  - `blazemeter_tests` with action `list` - List all tests in a project
  - Required args: `test_id` (integer) or `project_id` (integer)
  - Returns: Test details including script files and configuration

- **Test Execution**:
  - `blazemeter_execution` with action `read` - Read execution details for scripted tests
  - `blazemeter_execution` with action `list` - List all executions for a test
  - Required args: `execution_id` (integer) or `test_id` (integer)
  - Returns: Execution details and results

### When to Use MCP Tools

- **Test Management**: Manage tests with custom scripts programmatically
- **Script Validation**: Verify test scripts are configured correctly
- **Execution Monitoring**: Monitor execution of scripted tests
- **Automation**: Integrate scripted tests into automation workflows

### Example Workflow

**Managing Scripted Tests**:
1. Use `blazemeter_tests` with action `list` to find tests with custom scripts
2. Use `blazemeter_tests` with action `read` to get test details and script configuration
3. Use `blazemeter_execution` with action `read` to monitor test execution
4. Review execution results for script-related issues
