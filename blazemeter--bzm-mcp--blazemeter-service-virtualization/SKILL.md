# BlazeMeter Service Virtualization

Comprehensive guide for creating and managing virtual services in BlazeMeter.

## Overview

Service Virtualization enables simulating dependencies and services for testing, supporting transactions, virtual services, templates, and processing actions. This skill covers all aspects from introduction to advanced management.

## Quick Start

1. **Introduction**: Understand concepts, use cases, and terminology
2. **Transactions**: Add transactions from files or manually
3. **Virtual Services**: Create virtual services from transactions
4. **Management**: Clone, export/import, and manage services
5. **Analytics**: Monitor transaction usage and performance

## MCP Tools Integration

Service Virtualization services are managed through the BlazeMeter UI, but you can use MCP tools to manage tests that use virtual services:

### Available MCP Tools

- **Test Management**: 
  - `blazemeter_tests` with action `read` - Read test details including virtual service configuration
  - `blazemeter_tests` with action `list` - List all tests in a project
  - Required args: `test_id` (integer) or `project_id` (integer)
  - Returns: Test details including virtual service references

- **Test Execution**:
  - `blazemeter_execution` with action `read` - Read execution details for tests using virtual services
  - `blazemeter_execution` with action `list` - List all executions for a test
  - Required args: `execution_id` (integer) or `test_id` (integer)
  - Returns: Execution details and results

### When to Use MCP Tools

- **Test Management**: Manage tests that use virtual services programmatically
- **Execution Monitoring**: Monitor test executions that interact with virtual services
- **Automation**: Integrate virtual service testing into automation workflows
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on tests using virtual services

### Example Workflow

**Managing Tests with Virtual Services**:
1. Use `blazemeter_tests` with action `list` to find tests using virtual services
2. Use `blazemeter_tests` with action `read` to get test details and virtual service configuration
3. Use `blazemeter_execution` with action `read` to monitor test execution
4. Review execution results to verify virtual service interactions
