# Flashcard Creator

## Overview

This Skill extracts language learning content from web pages and converts it into structured flashcards optimized for spaced repetition software like Anki. Works with **any language** (Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Chinese, etc.) and adapts to different writing systems and grammar structures. Creates multiple card types (grammar rules, drills, translations, Q&A) from a single source to maximize repetition value.

## Prerequisites

- Browser must be open with Claude in Chrome extension active
- Target page should contain structured learning content (grammar lessons, vocabulary, exercises)
- Python script `parse_flashcards.py` available in the project root for Anki conversion

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Markdown Format Requirements

**THE PYTHON PARSER DEPENDS ON EXACT KEYWORD MATCHING. YOU MUST USE THIS FORMAT:**

```markdown
**Front:** Question, prompt, or term here
**Back:** Answer, explanation, or definition here
```

**Strict Requirements:**
1. Use `**Front:**` exactly - with bold markdown (`**`) and colon
2. Use `**Back:**` exactly - with bold markdown (`**`) and colon
3. Front and Back must be on separate, consecutive lines
4. Both keywords are case-sensitive
5. Include the space after the colon

**DO NOT USE:**
- ❌ `Front:` (without bold)
- ❌ `Question:` or `Q:`
- ❌ `**Front**:` (bold without the colon inside)
- ❌ `**Front :**` (space before colon)
- ❌ Any other variations

**Why This Matters:**
The Python parser (`parse_flashcards.py`) uses this code:
```python
if line.startswith('**Front:**'):
    front = line.replace('**Front:**', '').strip()
```

Any deviation from this exact format will cause cards to be silently skipped during parsing.

### Example Block (Correct Format)

```markdown
## Grammar Rules

**Front:** Cuando + presente de subjuntivo (futuro)
**Back:** Cuando me jubile, me iré a vivir a la costa.

**Front:** antes de que + presente de subjuntivo
**Back:** Los pájaros emigran a lugares más cálidos antes de que empiece el invierno.

## Fill-in-the-Blank Exercises

**Front:** Cuando _____ (tener - yo) vacaciones, _____ (soler) viajar a destinos exóticos.
**Back:** Cuando tengo vacaciones, suelo viajar a destinos exóticos.
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Web Content

1. Use `tabs_context_mcp` to get available tabs
2. Use `read_page` or `get_page_text` to extract content from the current page
3. Take a screenshot if visual context would be helpful

### Step 2: Analyze Content Structure

Identify these elements on the page:
- **Grammar rules** (with examples in different tenses/moods)
- **Vocabulary lists** (with definitions, translations, or context)
- **Example sentences** (showing usage patterns)
- **Exercises** (fill-in-blank, translation, matching)
- **Explanations** (rules, tips, memory aids)

### Step 3: Extract and Structure Content

Create flashcards organized by category using markdown headers (`##`, `###`).

**Recommended categories (adapt based on language type):**
- Grammar Patterns/Rules (word order, particles, connectors, etc.)
- Application Exercises (fill-in-the-blank, sentence building, etc.)
- Vocabulary (with definitions, translations, or usage context)
- Translation Practice (bidirectional)
- Quick Reference Q&A (grammar/usage rules)
- Common Mistakes/Corrections
- Memory Aids (mnemonics for grammar patterns)

**Note:** For inflected languages (Spanish, Russian, Arabic), add "Conjugation/Declension Drills". For tonal languages (Mandarin, Vietnamese), add "Tone Practice". For character-based writing (Japanese, Chinese), add "Character Recognition".

**Categories to AVOID:**
- ❌ Story/plot summaries (unless the vocabulary/structures themselves are the learning goal)
- ❌ Cultural trivia or facts (unless they illustrate language usage)
- ❌ Topic-specific knowledge unrelated to language (e.g., historical dates, scientific facts)
- ❌ Author information or website metadata

### Step 4: Create Multiple Card Types for Maximum Repetition

For each grammar concept or vocabulary item, create multiple card types. Adapt to your target language.

**Example 1: Spanish Grammar (Inflected Language)**

1. **Rule Card** - Present the grammar pattern
   ```markdown
   **Front:** Cuando + presente de subjuntivo (futuro)
   **Back:** Cuando me jubile, me iré a vivir a la costa.
   ```

2. **Fill-in-blank Card** - Test conjugation/application
   ```markdown
   **Front:** Cuando _____ (jubilarse - yo), me _____ (ir) a vivir a la costa.
   **Back:** Cuando me jubile, me iré a vivir a la costa.
   ```

3. **Translation Card** - Apply in context
   ```markdown
   **Front:** When I retire, I will go live on the coast.
   **Back:** Cuando me jubile, me iré a vivir a la costa.
   ```

4. **Quick Reference Card** - Test rule knowledge
   ```markdown
   **Front:** ¿Cómo se expresa el futuro con "cuando"?
   **Back:** Cuando + presente de subjuntivo
   ```

**Example 2: Japanese Vocabulary (Logographic + Syllabic)**

1. **Recognition Card**
   ```markdown
   **Front:** 食べる
   **Back:** たべる (taberu) - to eat [ru-verb]
   ```

2. **Production Card**
   ```markdown
   **Front:** How do you write "to eat" (ru-verb)?
   **Back:** 食べる (たべる / taberu)
   ```

3. **Context Card**
   ```markdown
   **Front:** 私は寿司を_____ (I ___ sushi)
   **Back:** 私は寿司を食べる (I eat sushi)
   ```

**Example 3: Arabic Grammar (Root-Pattern System)**

1. **Root Card**
   ```markdown
   **Front:** What is the root of كَتَبَ (kataba - "he wrote")?
   **Back:** ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) - root meaning "writing"
   ```

2. **Pattern Card**
   ```markdown
   **Front:** Form I past tense of root ك-ت-ب with "he"
   **Back:** كَتَبَ (kataba) - he wrote
   ```

### Step 5: Apply Language Learning Best Practices

**For Grammar:**
- Show the pattern in multiple contexts
- Include both affirmative and negative forms (if applicable)
- Show edge cases and exceptions
- Create "common mistakes" correction cards

**For Vocabulary:**
- Include context sentences, not just definitions
- Show collocations and usage patterns
- Group semantically related words
- Note register (formal/informal) when relevant

**For Language-Specific Features:**
- **Inflected languages** (Spanish, Russian, Arabic): Test conjugations/declensions across persons, tenses, cases
- **Tonal languages** (Mandarin, Vietnamese): Include tone marks and minimal pairs
- **Character-based** (Japanese, Chinese): Create recognition cards (character → reading/meaning)
- **Agglutinative languages** (Turkish, Finnish): Practice suffix combinations
- **Analytic languages** (English, Chinese grammar): Focus on word order and particles

**For Application Drills:**
- Use fill-in-the-blank format with hints (infinitive, tone, character reading, etc.)
- Progress from easier to harder
- Mix different concepts in later sections

### Step 6: Verify Quality

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] All cards use `**Front:**` and `**Back:**` format exactly
- [ ] Front and Back are on consecutive lines
- [ ] Content is in logical categories with headers
- [ ] Grammar rules are accurate
- [ ] Examples show proper usage patterns
- [ ] Fill-in-blank exercises include appropriate hints (verb infinitives, tone marks, readings, etc.)
- [ ] Progressive difficulty (basic → advanced)
- [ ] Mix of card types (rules, drills, translation, Q&A)
- [ ] Special characters are correct (accents, tone marks, diacritics, etc. appropriate for the language)
- [ ] At least 50+ cards for a comprehensive topic

### Step 7: Save Output File

- Use descriptive names: `<topic>.md`
- Write to `flashcards/` directory
- Include a header with title and description
- Include the URL of the source page
- Add a study strategy section at the end

### Step 8: Convert to Anki Format (REQUIRED)

**CRITICAL: This step is NOT optional. You MUST complete it automatically.**

After creating the markdown file:

1. **Immediately run the conversion script**:
   ```bash
   python3 parse_flashcards.py flashcards/<filename>.md
   ```
   - Do NOT just tell the user to run it - RUN IT YOURSELF
   - This is a required step to complete the task

2. **Verify the output**:
   ```bash
   wc -l flashcards/<filename>.txt
   ```
   - Check that cards were created successfully

**Why this matters**: The user expects a complete, ready-to-use Anki deck file. Creating only the markdown file is incomplete work. Always finish the conversion.

### Step 9: Report Results to the User

After successfully converting to Anki format, inform the user:

1. **Files created**:
   - **Markdown source**: `flashcards/<filename>.md`
   - **Anki deck file**: `flashcards/<filename>.txt` with [X] flashcards

2. **Next steps**:
   - **Ready to import**: The `.txt` file can be imported directly into Anki
   - **Optional grammar check**: "To verify grammar, ask a subagent to review the markdown file"

## Content Extraction Strategy

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Focus on LANGUAGE, Not Content

**Extract ONLY reusable language elements: grammar, vocabulary, and usage patterns.**

**Ask yourself:** "Will this card help me use the language, or just remember facts ABOUT the content?"

✅ **DO extract:**
- Grammar patterns and rules
- Vocabulary with translations/definitions
- Usage examples and collocations
- Language-specific conventions (formality levels, register, etc.)

❌ **DON'T extract:**
- Plot summaries or story content (unless the vocabulary/structures themselves are the learning goal)
- Cultural/historical facts mentioned in passing
- Topic-specific knowledge that won't transfer to other contexts
- Website navigation or course structure information

**Example of what NOT to include:**
- "What are the stages of [story concept]?" - Content knowledge, not language
- "Who invented [theory]?" - Trivia, not language learning
- "What does [topic-specific term] mean?" - Unless it's widely-used vocabulary

**Example of what TO include:**
- "Cuando + presente de subjuntivo" - Grammar pattern (Spanish)
- "食べる (taberu) - to eat" - Vocabulary with reading (Japanese)
- "How to express future time with 'cuando'" - Language usage rule

### What to Prioritize

1. **Grammar patterns with examples** - highest value for language learning
2. **Conjugation tables** - convert to fill-in-blank exercises
3. **Vocabulary words and phrases** - with translations and context
4. **Example sentences** - use as-is or convert to translation practice
5. **Language rules and explanations** - convert to Q&A format
6. **Common mistakes sections** - create error correction cards
7. **Idiomatic expressions** - with usage examples

### What to Skip or Minimize

- ❌ Long reading passages (not suitable for flashcards)
- ❌ Complex multi-paragraph explanations (summarize language aspects only)
- ❌ Navigation elements, ads, site metadata
- ❌ Author bios, course promotions
- ❌ **Content-specific information** (stories, plots, cultural facts used as context)
- ❌ **Topical knowledge** that won't help learn the language itself

### Handling Different Content Types

**From a grammar lesson:**
- Extract the rule statement
- Gather all example sentences
- Create variations for different tenses
- Note exceptions explicitly

**From vocabulary lists:**
- Word + definition/translation
- Word in context sentence
- Collocations

**From exercises:**
- Convert multiple choice to fill-in-blank
- Extract correct answers
- Include explanation if provided

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Wrong Keywords** - Not using `**Front:**` and `**Back:**` exactly
2. **Merged Lines** - Putting Front and Back on the same line
3. **Too Much Text** - Making cards too long (keep under 2-3 sentences)
4. **No Organization** - Not using headers to categorize cards
5. **Missing Hints** - Fill-in-blanks without verb/tense hints
6. **No Variety** - Only one card type (need drills, Q&A, translation, etc.)
7. **Skipping Verification** - Not checking accent marks and grammar
8. **Random Order** - Not organizing by difficulty or category

## Examples

### Example: Complete Workflow

**User request**: "Create flashcards from this Spanish grammar page about time expressions"

**Claude's process**:

1. **Access content**: Use `tabs_context_mcp` and `get_page_text`
2. **Analyze**: Identify temporal connectors lesson with 6 main concepts
3. **Extract language elements**:
   - ✅ Grammar patterns (cuando, antes de, mientras, etc.)
   - ✅ Example sentences showing usage
   - ✅ Vocabulary (valiente, cruel, etc.)
   - ❌ Skip: Story content used as examples (extract language, not plot)
   - ❌ Skip: Trivia about theories or concepts mentioned on the page
4. **Structure content**:
   - Grammar rules with examples in different tenses
   - Vocabulary with translations
   - Fill-in-blank application drills
   - Translation practice
   - Quick reference Q&A
   - Common mistakes
   - Memory aids
5. **Write file**: `flashcards/temporal-connectors.md`
6. **Convert**: Run `python3 parse_flashcards.py flashcards/temporal-connectors.md`
7. **Verify**: Check line count shows 153 flashcards created
8. **Report**: "Created temporal-connectors.txt with 153 flashcards ready to import into Anki"

### Example: Flashcard Format

See the "CRITICAL: Markdown Format Requirements" section above for the exact required format.

## Key Principles

**Maximum repetition value**: Create multiple cards for the same concept from different angles (rule, drill, translation, Q&A).

**Progressive difficulty**: Start with basic patterns, move to complex applications.

**Context over memorization**: Always include example sentences, not just isolated rules or definitions.
