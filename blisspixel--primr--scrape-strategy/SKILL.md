# Scrape Strategy



## Purpose



Use this skill when the bottleneck is site access rather than report writing. Focus on deciding whether to stay in scrape-capable modes or pivot to external research.



## Workflow



1. Read `primr://research/modes` to compare scrape, deep, full, and premium behavior.

2. Review current run state through `primr://research/status` or `check_jobs`.

3. Use `references/tiers.md` only when you need tier-level scraping context.

4. Recommend the smallest viable change: retry, change mode, or accept partial coverage.



## Decision Rules



- Prefer `deep` when the target site is heavily protected or first-party signal is sparse.

- Stay with `scrape` or `full` when first-party pages are the core evidence source.

- Do not promise exact success percentages unless the run data already shows them.

- Escalate from site troubleshooting to mode selection quickly; avoid over-explaining scrape internals unless the user asks.



## Example



```text

User: The site seems blocked



1. Read primr://research/status

2. Read primr://research/modes

3. Explain whether deep mode is the better fit

4. If needed, estimate_run(company_url="https://example.com", mode="deep")

```
