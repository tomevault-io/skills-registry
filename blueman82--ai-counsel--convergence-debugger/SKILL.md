# Convergence Detection Debugger

## Overview

The AI Counsel convergence detection system (`deliberation/convergence.py`) determines when models have reached consensus and can stop deliberating early. It uses semantic similarity comparison between consecutive rounds, with voting outcomes taking precedence when available.

**Common Issue**: Convergence not detected → wasted API calls
**Common Issue**: Early stopping not triggering → deliberation runs full max_rounds
**Common Issue**: Semantic vs voting status conflict → confusing results

## Diagnostic Workflow

### Step 1: Examine the Transcript

**What to look for:**
- Are responses actually similar between rounds?
- Is there a "Convergence Information" section?
- What's the reported status and similarity scores?
- Are there votes? What's the voting outcome?

**File location:**
```bash
# Transcripts are in project root
ls -lt transcripts/*.md | head -5

# Open most recent
open "transcripts/$(ls -t transcripts/*.md | head -1)"
```

**Convergence section example:**
```markdown
## Convergence Information
- **Status**: refining (40.00% - 85.00% similarity)
- **Average Similarity**: 72.31%
- **Minimum Similarity**: 68.45%
```

**Voting section example (overrides semantic status):**
```markdown
## Final Voting Results
- **Winner**: TypeScript ✓
- **Status**: majority_decision
- **Tally**: TypeScript: 2, JavaScript: 1
```

**Missing convergence section?**
→ Check if `round_number <= min_rounds_before_check` (see Step 2)

### Step 2: Check Configuration

**Read the config:**
```bash
cat config.yaml
```

**Key settings to verify:**

```yaml
deliberation:
  convergence_detection:
    enabled: true  # Must be true
    semantic_similarity_threshold: 0.85  # Convergence if ALL participants >= this
    divergence_threshold: 0.40  # Diverging if ANY participant < this
    min_rounds_before_check: 1  # Must be <= (total_rounds - 1)
    consecutive_stable_rounds: 2  # Require this many stable rounds

  early_stopping:
    enabled: true  # Must be true for model-controlled stopping
    threshold: 0.66  # Fraction of models that must want to stop (2/3)
    respect_min_rounds: true  # Won't stop before defaults.rounds
```

**Common misconfigurations:**

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No convergence info in transcript | `min_rounds_before_check` too high | For 2-round deliberation, use `min_rounds_before_check: 1` |
| Early stopping never triggers | `respect_min_rounds: true` but models converge before `defaults.rounds` | Set to `false` or reduce `defaults.rounds` |
| Convergence threshold too strict | `semantic_similarity_threshold: 0.95` | Lower to 0.80-0.85 for practical convergence |
| Everything marked "diverging" | `divergence_threshold: 0.70` too high | Use default 0.40 (models rarely agree <40%) |

### Step 3: Check Backend Selection

**The system auto-selects the best available backend:**

1. **SentenceTransformerBackend** (best) - requires `sentence-transformers`
2. **TFIDFBackend** (good) - requires `scikit-learn`
3. **JaccardBackend** (fallback) - zero dependencies (word overlap)

**Check what's installed:**
```bash
python -c "import sentence_transformers; print('✓ SentenceTransformer available')" 2>/dev/null || echo "✗ SentenceTransformer not available"
python -c "import sklearn; print('✓ TF-IDF available')" 2>/dev/null || echo "✗ TF-IDF not available"
```

**Check what backend was used:**
```bash
# Look at server logs
tail -50 mcp_server.log | grep -i "backend\|similarity"
```

**Expected log output:**
```
INFO - ConvergenceDetector initialized with SentenceTransformerBackend
INFO - Using SentenceTransformerBackend (best accuracy)
```

**If using Jaccard (fallback):**
- Similarity scores will be lower (word overlap only)
- Semantic paraphrasing NOT detected
- Consider installing optional dependencies:

```bash
# Install enhanced backends
pip install -r requirements-optional.txt

# Or individually
pip install sentence-transformers  # Best
pip install scikit-learn           # Good
```

### Step 4: Debug Semantic Similarity Scores

**Scenario: Responses look identical but similarity is low**

**Possible causes:**
1. Using Jaccard backend (doesn't understand semantics)
2. Responses have different formatting/structure
3. Models added different examples/details

**Test similarity manually:**
```python
# Create test script: test_similarity.py
from deliberation.convergence import ConvergenceDetector
from models.config import load_config

config = load_config("config.yaml")
detector = ConvergenceDetector(config)

text1 = "I prefer TypeScript for type safety and better tooling"
text2 = "TypeScript is better because it has types and good IDE support"

score = detector.backend.compute_similarity(text1, text2)
print(f"Similarity: {score:.2%}")
print(f"Backend: {detector.backend.__class__.__name__}")
```

**Run it:**
```bash
python test_similarity.py
```

**Expected results by backend:**
- **SentenceTransformer**: 75-85% (understands semantic similarity)
- **TF-IDF**: 50-65% (word importance weighting)
- **Jaccard**: 30-45% (simple word overlap)

### Step 5: Debug Voting vs Semantic Status Conflicts

**The voting outcome ALWAYS overrides semantic similarity status when votes are present.**

**Status precedence (highest to lowest):**
1. **unanimous_consensus** - All models voted same option
2. **majority_decision** - 2+ models agreed (e.g., 2-1 vote)
3. **tie** - Equal votes for all options (e.g., 1-1-1)
4. **Semantic status** - Only used if no votes present:
   - `converged` - All participants ≥85% similar
   - `refining` - Between 40-85% similarity
   - `diverging` - Any participant <40% similar
   - `impasse` - Stable disagreement over multiple rounds

**Check if votes are being parsed:**
```bash
# Search transcript for VOTE markers
grep -A 5 "VOTE:" "transcripts/$(ls -t transcripts/*.md | head -1)"
```

**Expected vote format in model responses:**
```
VOTE: {"option": "TypeScript", "confidence": 0.85, "rationale": "Type safety is crucial", "continue_debate": false}
```

**If votes aren't being parsed:**
- Check that models are outputting exact `VOTE: {json}` format
- Verify JSON is valid (use online JSON validator)
- Check logs for parsing errors: `grep -i "vote\|parse" mcp_server.log`

### Step 6: Debug Early Stopping

**Early stopping requires:**
1. `early_stopping.enabled: true` in config
2. At least `threshold` fraction of models set `continue_debate: false`
3. Current round ≥ `defaults.rounds` (if `respect_min_rounds: true`)

**Example: 3 models, threshold 0.66 (66%)**
- Round 1: All say `continue_debate: true` → continues
- Round 2: 2 models say `continue_debate: false` → stops (2/3 = 66.7%)

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check if enabled:**
```bash
grep -A 3 "early_stopping:" config.yaml
```

2. **Check model votes in transcript:**
```bash
# Look for continue_debate flags
grep -i "continue_debate" "transcripts/$(ls -t transcripts/*.md | head -1)"
```

3. **Check logs for early stop decision:**
```bash
grep -i "early stop\|continue_debate" mcp_server.log | tail -20
```

4. **Common issues:**

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Models want to stop but deliberation continues | `respect_min_rounds: true` and not at min rounds yet | Wait for min rounds or set to `false` |
| Threshold not met | Only 1/3 models want to stop (33% < 66%) | Need 2/3 consensus |
| Not enabled | `enabled: false` | Set to `true` |
| Models not outputting flag | Vote JSON missing `continue_debate` field | Add to model prompts |

### Step 7: Debug Impasse Detection

**Impasse = stable disagreement over multiple rounds**

**Requirements:**
1. Status is `diverging` (min_similarity < 0.40)
2. `consecutive_stable_rounds` threshold reached (default: 2)

**Check impasse logic:**
```python
# Read convergence.py lines 380-385
# Impasse is only detected if diverging AND stable
```

**Common issue: Never reaches impasse**
- Models keep changing positions → not stable
- Divergence threshold too low → never marks as "diverging"
- Need at least 2-3 rounds of consistent disagreement

**Manual check:**
```bash
# Look at similarity scores across rounds
grep "Minimum Similarity" "transcripts/$(ls -t transcripts/*.md | head -1)"
```

**If similarity jumps around (45% → 25% → 60%):**
→ Models aren't stable, impasse won't trigger

### Step 8: Performance Diagnostics

**If convergence detection is slow:**

1. **Check if SentenceTransformer is downloading models:**
```bash
# First run downloads ~500MB model
tail -f mcp_server.log | grep -i "loading\|download"
```

2. **Model is cached after first load:**
- Subsequent deliberations are instant (model reused from memory)
- Cache is per-process (each server restart reloads)

3. **Check computation time:**
```bash
# Add timing to test script
import time

start = time.time()
score = detector.backend.compute_similarity(text1, text2)
elapsed = time.time() - start

print(f"Computation time: {elapsed*1000:.2f}ms")
```

**Expected times:**
- **SentenceTransformer**: 50-200ms per comparison (first run slower)
- **TF-IDF**: 10-50ms per comparison
- **Jaccard**: <1ms per comparison

## Quick Reference

### Configuration Parameters

```yaml
# Convergence thresholds
semantic_similarity_threshold: 0.85  # Range: 0.0-1.0, higher = stricter
divergence_threshold: 0.40           # Range: 0.0-1.0, lower = more sensitive

# Round constraints
min_rounds_before_check: 1           # Must be <= (total_rounds - 1)
consecutive_stable_rounds: 2         # Stability requirement

# Early stopping
early_stopping.threshold: 0.66       # Fraction of models needed (0.5 = majority)
respect_min_rounds: true             # Honor defaults.rounds minimum
```

### Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Similarity Range |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| converged | All participants agree | ≥85% (by default) |
| refining | Moderate agreement | 40-85% |
| diverging | Low agreement | <40% |
| impasse | Stable disagreement | <40% for 2+ rounds |
| unanimous_consensus | All voted same (overrides semantic) | N/A (voting) |
| majority_decision | 2+ voted same (overrides semantic) | N/A (voting) |
| tie | Equal votes (overrides semantic) | N/A (voting) |

### Common Fixes

**Problem: No convergence info in transcript**
```yaml
# Fix: Lower min_rounds_before_check
min_rounds_before_check: 1  # For 2-round deliberations
```

**Problem: Never converges despite identical responses**
```bash
# Fix: Install better backend
pip install sentence-transformers
```

**Problem: Early stopping not working**
```yaml
# Fix: Check these settings
early_stopping:
  enabled: true
  threshold: 0.66
  respect_min_rounds: false  # Allow stopping before min rounds
```

**Problem: Everything marked "diverging"**
```yaml
# Fix: Lower divergence threshold
divergence_threshold: 0.40  # Default (not 0.70)
```

## Testing Convergence Detection

**Create integration test:**
```python
# tests/integration/test_convergence_debug.py
import pytest
from deliberation.convergence import ConvergenceDetector
from models.config import load_config
from models.schema import RoundResponse, Participant

def test_convergence_identical_responses():
    """Test that identical responses trigger convergence."""
    config = load_config("config.yaml")
    detector = ConvergenceDetector(config)

    # Create identical responses
    round1 = [
        RoundResponse(participant="claude", response="TypeScript is best", vote=None),
        RoundResponse(participant="codex", response="TypeScript is best", vote=None),
    ]
    round2 = [
        RoundResponse(participant="claude", response="TypeScript is best", vote=None),
        RoundResponse(participant="codex", response="TypeScript is best", vote=None),
    ]

    result = detector.check_convergence(round2, round1, round_number=2)

    assert result is not None, "Should check convergence at round 2"
    assert result.avg_similarity > 0.90, f"Identical responses should be >90% similar, got {result.avg_similarity}"
    print(f"Backend: {detector.backend.__class__.__name__}")
    print(f"Similarity: {result.avg_similarity:.2%}")
    print(f"Status: {result.status}")
```

**Run test:**
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_convergence_debug.py -v -s
```

## Advanced Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

```python
# Add to deliberation/engine.py or server.py
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Inspect Backend State

```python
# In Python shell or test
from deliberation.convergence import ConvergenceDetector
from models.config import load_config

config = load_config("config.yaml")
detector = ConvergenceDetector(config)

print(f"Backend: {detector.backend.__class__.__name__}")
print(f"Threshold: {detector.config.semantic_similarity_threshold}")
print(f"Min rounds: {detector.config.min_rounds_before_check}")
print(f"Consecutive stable: {detector.config.consecutive_stable_rounds}")
```

### Compare All Backends

```python
# test_all_backends.py
from deliberation.convergence import (
    JaccardBackend,
    TFIDFBackend,
    SentenceTransformerBackend
)

text1 = "I prefer TypeScript for type safety"
text2 = "TypeScript is better because it has types"

backends = {
    "Jaccard": JaccardBackend(),
}

try:
    backends["TF-IDF"] = TFIDFBackend()
except ImportError:
    print("TF-IDF not available")

try:
    backends["SentenceTransformer"] = SentenceTransformerBackend()
except ImportError:
    print("SentenceTransformer not available")

for name, backend in backends.items():
    score = backend.compute_similarity(text1, text2)
    print(f"{name:20s}: {score:.2%}")
```

## Summary

**Always check in order:**
1. ✅ Transcript - Does convergence info appear?
2. ✅ Config - Are thresholds reasonable?
3. ✅ Backend - Is the best backend installed?
4. ✅ Voting - Are votes being parsed correctly?
5. ✅ Early stopping - Is it enabled and configured correctly?
6. ✅ Logs - Any errors or warnings?

**Most common fixes:**
- Lower `min_rounds_before_check` to 1 for short deliberations
- Install `sentence-transformers` for better semantic detection
- Set `early_stopping.respect_min_rounds: false` for faster stopping
- Lower `semantic_similarity_threshold` from 0.95 to 0.85
- Check that models output valid `VOTE:` JSON with `continue_debate` field
