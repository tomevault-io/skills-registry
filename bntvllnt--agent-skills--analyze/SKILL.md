# Universal Analyzer

**A standalone skill for multi-perspective analysis of any topic, file, idea, or decision.**

Use when:
- Need to extract KEY POINTS from anything
- Want multi-perspective gap/risk analysis (4-10 experts)
- Need improvement opportunities with actionable plans
- Want quick summary OR deep analysis mode
- Need first-principles brief that challenges assumptions

Triggers: "analyze", "key points", "what's important", "improve this", "review", "examine", "assess", "analysis", "deep analysis", "run deep analysis", "brief", "challenge assumptions", "first principles"

## Agent Capabilities

| Capability | Used For | Required | Fallback |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| File read | Load target files/folders | Yes | — |
| Sub-agent dispatch | Parallel perspective analysis | Recommended | Sequential in main thread |
| Codebase intelligence (`npx codebase-intelligence`) | Structural analysis for TS/TSX software domain | No | Pure reasoning from file contents |

This skill remains fully functional without CLI tools. Codebase intelligence is an optional enhancement for the software domain only.

---

## Execution Flow

### Phase 0: Detection
1. **Mode**: Detect from keywords (quick/standard/deep)
2. **Domain**: Auto-detect from content/keywords
3. **Target**: Load file/folder content if path provided
4. **TypeScript detection**: If target is a code path and `tsconfig.json` exists:
   - Detection gate: `tsconfig.json` exists + `npx codebase-intelligence --help` succeeds
   - For full CLI reference, fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bntvllnt/codebase-intelligence/main/llms.txt`
   - If available: gather structural data in Phase 1
   - If unavailable: proceed with pure file-reading context gathering

### Phase 1: Context Gathering
- **File/folder path** → Read files
- **Software domain + TypeScript + CI available** → Augment file reading with:
  - `npx codebase-intelligence overview --json <path>` → project structure snapshot
  - `npx codebase-intelligence modules --json <path>` → module boundaries and cross-deps
  - `npx codebase-intelligence groups --json <path>` → directory-level aggregates
  Include as structured context alongside file contents. If CI unavailable: read files only.
- **Topic/idea** → Use provided context
- **Unfamiliar domain** → Optional web search

### Phase 2: Analysis

#### Quick Mode
Direct analysis by primary agent, no sub-agents

#### Standard Mode
1. Select 4-6 perspectives based on domain
2. Launch all perspectives in parallel (single message block)
3. Each agent answers 7 core questions

#### Deep Mode
1. Select 6-10 perspectives based on domain
2. Launch all perspectives in parallel (single message block)
3. Each agent answers 12 questions (7 core + 5 deep)

#### Software Domain Enhancement (TypeScript + CI available)

Include pre-computed structural data in software domain agent prompts:
- `npx codebase-intelligence hotspots --json --metric complexity --limit 20` → complexity/churn hotspots
- `npx codebase-intelligence forces --json` → cohesion/coupling tensions per module
- `npx codebase-intelligence dead-exports --json --limit 20` → unused export analysis
- `npx codebase-intelligence clusters --json` → dependency community clusters

Agents receive this as structured context alongside the target content. Supplements their analysis — does not replace independent reasoning. If CI unavailable: agents analyze from file contents only.

### Phase 3: Synthesis
After ALL agents complete:
1. Aggregate Failure Hypotheses → prioritize Critical→High→Med→Low
2. Extract TOP 10 key points → rank by consensus
3. Identify gaps → Critical/High/Medium/Low
4. Generate actionable roadmap with dependencies

## Thinking Framework

### The UltraThink Loop

```
THINK → CHECKLIST → PLAN → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → LEARN
```

#### Phase 0: THINK
**Select thinking model based on task type:**

| Model | When to Use | Pattern |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **CoT** (Chain of Thought) | Linear, sequential tasks | Step-by-step reasoning |
| **ToT** (Tree of Thought) | Multiple valid paths, decisions | Evaluate branches, pick best |
| **Reflexion** | Learning from failure, retry logic | Analyze error → adjust → retry |
| **Decomposition** | Complex tasks, parallel work | Break into sub-problems |

**For Analysis:** Use **ToT** (multi-perspective evaluation) for Standard/Deep, **CoT** for Quick

#### Phase 1: CHECKLIST
- [ ] Mode detected (quick/standard/deep) [blocking]
- [ ] Domain identified [blocking]
- [ ] Target content accessible [blocking]
- [ ] Perspectives selected [blocking]
- [ ] Agents dispatched in parallel [blocking]
- [ ] All agents completed [blocking]
- [ ] Synthesis complete [advisory]

#### Phase 2: PLAN
**For Standard/Deep:**
```
1. Detect mode from keywords
2. Detect domain from content
3. Select N perspectives (4-6 for standard, 6-10 for deep)
4. Launch all agents in ONE message block
5. Wait for completion
6. Synthesize findings
7. Generate output
```

#### Phase 3: EXECUTE
Execute plan with progress tracking. On failure → trigger Reflexion (max 2 retries)

#### Phase 4: VALIDATE
- All agents returned findings? ✓
- Cross-cutting concerns identified? ✓
- Actionable roadmap generated? ✓

#### Phase 5: LEARN
Capture patterns for continuous improvement

### Self-Correction Guide

| Issue | Check | Fix | Escalate If |
|-------|-------|-----|-------------|
| Shallow analysis | Domain auto-detected? | Add specific perspectives | Still shallow after 2 retries |
| Mode mismatch | User keywords? | Ask for clarification | Agent count doesn't match |
| Weak synthesis | All agents complete? | Re-run failed agents | <3 perspectives useful |
| Wrong domain | Keywords ambiguous? | Ask user explicitly | Multiple domains equally valid |

**Max iterations**: 2 | **Escalation**: Ask user to specify domain/perspectives

---

## First-Principles Analysis

**Philosophy**: Don't just summarize—decompose to fundamentals, surface what's actually true vs assumed, and raise what the user hasn't considered. User must always get data to make their own decisions.

### A. Verified Facts (Separate from Assumptions)

- Only report what can be VERIFIED with evidence
- Include source: `path/file:line` or [URL]
- Mark confidence: High (verified) / Medium (inferred) / Low (stated but unverified)

### B. First-Principles Decomposition

Apply these questions to EVERYTHING found:

#### 1. Question Assumptions
- What's being assumed that hasn't been validated?
- Is this constraint real or inherited from old decisions?
- What would change if [assumption] were false?

#### 2. Decompose to Fundamentals
- What MUST be true for this to work?
- What are the actual dependencies (not just stated ones)?
- What's the irreducible core?

#### 3. Systems Thinking
- What else does this affect? (upstream/downstream)
- What's the blast radius if this fails?
- What's competing for the same resources?

#### 4. Root Cause vs Symptom
- Is the current state addressing root cause or masking symptoms?
- Why does this exist in its current form?
- What problem was this originally solving?

### C. Assumptions to Challenge (MANDATORY)

Every analysis MUST include this table:

| Assumption | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Verdict |
|------------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| [Assumed thing] | [If any] | [If any] | Validate/Keep/Discard |

### D. What You Haven't Considered (MANDATORY 2-4 items)

Surface items the user likely hasn't thought about:

| Category | What to Look For |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Unvalidated Assumptions** | Things treated as true without evidence |
| **Hidden Dependencies** | Non-obvious things this relies on |
| **Downstream Impacts** | What breaks if this changes |
| **Simpler Alternatives** | Is there a 10x simpler approach? |
| **Edge Cases** | What inputs/states break this? |
| **Technical Debt** | Shortcuts that will cost later |
| **Missing Pieces** | What's conspicuously absent? |

### E. The Real Question

Reframe what the user should actually be asking. Often the stated question isn't the right question.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Mode

```
Input: analyze quick "our pricing strategy"

Output:
# Quick Analysis: Pricing Strategy

**Mode**: Quick | **Domain**: Business | **Date**: 2026-01-28

## The Essence
A business decision about how to extract value from customers, constrained by market dynamics and competitive positioning.

## Verified Facts
- (Would include actual facts from provided content)

## Key Points
1. **Pricing = value capture, not cost recovery**: Price based on customer willingness to pay, not internal costs
2. **Anchor matters**: First price seen shapes all subsequent evaluations
...

## Assumptions to Challenge
| Assumption | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Verdict |
|------------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| "Customers will pay more if we add features" | Common belief | Often false - bloat reduces WTP | Validate with tests |

## What You Haven't Considered
1. **Price as a signal**: Low price may signal low quality, harming conversion
2. **Competitive response**: Price changes trigger competitor reactions
3. **Simplicity premium**: Simpler pricing often outperforms complex tiers

## The Real Question
Not "what price should we charge" but "what's the maximum value customers perceive, and how do we capture 30-50% of it?"

## Quick Actions
- [ ] Survey 20 target customers on WTP before changing price
- [ ] A/B test 2-3 price points on landing page
- [ ] Model competitor response scenarios

## Critical Risk to Watch
Pricing too low initially makes raising prices later extremely difficult (customer backlash + anchoring effect)
```

### Example 2: Standard Mode

```
Input: analyze "SaaS product for developers"

Flow:
1. Detect mode: standard (no quick/deep keywords)
2. Detect domain: product + software
3. Select 6 perspectives:
   - Product Manager
   - Developer (user persona)
   - Security Engineer
   - DevOps
   - Support Lead
   - Investor
4. Launch all 6 agents in parallel
5. Synthesize findings into standard format
6. Generate actionable roadmap

Output: [Standard format with all sections filled]
```

### Example 3: Deep Mode

```
Input: analyze deep "migration to microservices"

Flow:
1. Detect mode: deep
2. Detect domain: software
3. Select 10 perspectives:
   - Architect
   - DevOps
   - Security Engineer
   - Database Engineer
   - Frontend Developer
   - QA Engineer
   - Performance Engineer
   - SRE
   - Tech Lead
   - CTO
4. Launch all 10 agents in parallel
5. Each answers 12 questions (7 core + 5 deep)
6. Synthesize into deep format with dependency map
7. Generate comprehensive roadmap (immediate/short/medium/long)

Output: [Deep format with extended sections]
```

## Common Failure Patterns

| Failure | Root Cause | Reflexion Response |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Wrong domain detected | Ambiguous keywords | Ask user explicitly or use General domain |
| Too few perspectives | Quick mode used for complex topic | Escalate to Standard mode |
| Weak synthesis | Agent outputs inconsistent | Re-run with explicit constraints |
| Missing blind spots | Obvious perspectives chosen | Add Devil's Advocate perspective |
| Roadmap not actionable | Actions too vague | Break each action into atomic: owner, deadline, metric |
| Analysis takes >2min | Too many agents (Deep mode overkill) | Switch to Standard mode |

---

## Integration Notes

This skill is **standalone** and includes all necessary frameworks:
- UltraThink cognitive framework (embedded)
- First-principles analysis (embedded)
- Perspectives library (embedded)
- Output formats (embedded)

No external dependencies required.

**Optional enhancement:** For software domain analysis of TypeScript codebases, `codebase-intelligence` CLI (`npx codebase-intelligence --json`) provides structural data — hotspots, coupling, dead exports, module boundaries, blast radius. Detection: `tsconfig.json` must exist. For full CLI reference, fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bntvllnt/codebase-intelligence/main/llms-full.txt`. The skill works identically without it — data is supplementary context for perspective agents.
