# GitHub

GitHub operations via `gh`.

## Router

| User says | Load reference | Do |
|---|---|---|
| help / gh help / flags / options | `references/cli-help.md` | show CLI help safely |
| auth / login / token | `references/auth.md` | authenticate gh |
| repo / clone / fork / sync | `references/repo.md` | repository operations |
| issue / issues | `references/issue.md` | issue triage and management |
| pr / pull request / review | `references/pr.md` | PR create/review/merge workflows |
| actions / workflow / run | `references/actions.md` | GitHub Actions (workflows + runs) |
| ci / monitor ci / check ci / ci status / watch ci | `references/ci-monitor.md` | monitor CI checks with live polling (if user says bare "ci", ask: monitor checks or view workflows?) |
| pr dashboard / pr overview / open prs / my prs / pr status | `references/pr-dashboard.md` | PR overview with status classification |
| release / publish release | `references/release.md` | releases + assets + verification |
| release strategy / release format / versioning | `references/release-strategy.md` | versioning, title/description format, generation protocol |
| secrets / variables | `references/secrets-vars.md` | manage secrets and variables |
| project | `references/projects.md` | projects operations |
| gist | `references/gists.md` | gist operations |
| search | `references/search.md` | search repos/issues/prs/code |
| api | `references/api.md` | gh api (advanced) |
| extension | `references/extensions.md` | manage gh extensions |
| config | `references/config.md` | gh config basics |

## Safety Rules

- Confirm before any state-changing operation (create/edit/delete/merge/close).
- Never upload secrets as assets.
- Treat `gh api` as powerful: confirm before any write operation.
- Never delete or move published releases/tags unless explicitly requested.
- When creating PRs, always set an assignee: default to `@me` unless the user explicitly names someone else.
- When creating PRs, apply relevant existing labels when possible; auto-pick from PR context (title/body/branch + changed paths) and avoid creating new labels unless truly necessary.
- If labels must be created, retrieve existing labels first (`gh label list`), propose the minimal set consistent with repo naming, and confirm before `gh label create`.

## Confirmation Policy

Read-only commands are always OK.

Require confirmation:

- `gh issue create/edit/close/reopen/delete`
- `gh pr create/edit/close/merge/review`
- `gh repo create/edit/rename/archive/delete/sync`
- `gh release create/edit/delete`, `gh release upload`, `gh release delete-asset`
- `gh secret set/delete`, `gh variable set/delete`
- `gh run rerun`, `gh run cancel`
- `gh api` calls that mutate state (POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE)

## Read-Only (No Confirmation Needed)

```bash
gh auth status
gh release list
gh release view <tag>
gh release view <tag> --web
gh help
gh pr checks <number> --json ...
gh run list --branch <branch> --json ...
gh run view <run-id>
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```
