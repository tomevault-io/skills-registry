# Skill Developer Guide

## Purpose

Comprehensive guide for creating and managing skills in Claude Code with auto-activation system, following Anthropic's official best practices including the 500-line rule and progressive disclosure pattern.

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activates when you mention:
- Creating or adding skills
- Modifying skill triggers or rules
- Understanding how skill activation works
- Debugging skill activation issues
- Working with skill-rules.json
- Hook system mechanics
- Claude Code best practices
- Progressive disclosure
- YAML frontmatter
- 500-line rule

---

## System Overview

### Two-Hook Architecture

**1. UserPromptSubmit Hook** (Proactive Skill Suggestions)
- **File**: `.claude/hooks/skill-activation-prompt.ts`
- **Trigger**: BEFORE Claude sees user's prompt
- **Purpose**: Suggest relevant skills based on keywords + intent patterns
- **Method**: Injects formatted reminder as context (stdout → Claude's input)
- **Use Cases**: Topic-based skills, implicit work detection

**2. PostToolUse Hook** (File Change Tracking)
- **File**: `.claude/hooks/post-tool-use-tracker.sh`
- **Trigger**: AFTER Edit/Write/MultiEdit tools complete successfully
- **Purpose**: Track which files and repos were modified during the session
- **Method**: Logs to tsc-cache, stores build/tsc commands for affected repos
- **Use Cases**: Session-scoped change tracking, build command automation

**Current Implementation:** This orchestrator uses suggestion-based skills (via UserPromptSubmit) and post-edit tracking (via PostToolUse). There is no PreToolUse blocking mechanism currently implemented.



### Configuration File

**Location**: `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json`

Defines:
- All skills and their trigger conditions
- Enforcement levels (block, suggest, warn)
- File path patterns (glob)
- Content detection patterns (regex)
- Skip conditions (session tracking, file markers, env vars)

---

## Skill Types

### 1. Critical Skills

**Purpose:** Strongly suggest critical best practices

**Characteristics:**
- Type: `"guardrail"` (naming convention, not enforced)
- Enforcement: `"suggest"` (no blocking in current implementation)
- Priority: `"critical"` or `"high"`
- Strongly suggested via UserPromptSubmit hook
- Prevent common mistakes through awareness
- Important patterns that should always be considered

**Examples:**
- `database-verification` - Suggest verification of table/column names
- `frontend-dev-guidelines` - Suggest React/TypeScript patterns

**When to Use:**
- Mistakes that could cause runtime errors
- Data integrity concerns
- Critical compatibility issues

**Note:** True blocking enforcement requires PreToolUse hooks, which are not currently implemented in this orchestrator.

### 2. Domain Skills

**Purpose:** Provide comprehensive guidance for specific areas

**Characteristics:**
- Type: `"domain"`
- Enforcement: `"suggest"`
- Priority: `"high"` or `"medium"`
- Advisory, not mandatory
- Topic or domain-specific
- Comprehensive documentation

**Examples:**
- `backend-dev-guidelines` - Node.js/Express/TypeScript patterns
- `frontend-dev-guidelines` - React/TypeScript best practices
- `error-tracking` - Sentry integration guidance

**When to Use:**
- Complex systems requiring deep knowledge
- Best practices documentation
- Architectural patterns
- How-to guides

## Quick Start: Creating a New Skill

### Step 1: Create Skill File

**Location:** `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

**Template:**
```markdown
---
name: my-new-skill
description: Brief description including keywords that trigger this skill. Mention topics, file types, and use cases. Be explicit about trigger terms.
---

# My New Skill

## Purpose
What this skill helps with

## When to Use
Specific scenarios and conditions

## Key Information
The actual guidance, documentation, patterns, examples
```

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Name**: Lowercase, hyphens, gerund form (verb + -ing) preferred
- ✅ **Description**: Include ALL trigger keywords/phrases (max 1024 chars)
- ✅ **Content**: Under 500 lines - use reference files for details
- ✅ **Examples**: Real code examples
- ✅ **Structure**: Clear headings, lists, code blocks

### Step 2: Add to skill-rules.json

See [SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md](SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md) for complete schema.

**Basic Template:**
```json
{
  "my-new-skill": {
    "type": "domain",
    "enforcement": "suggest",
    "priority": "medium",
    "promptTriggers": {
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "intentPatterns": ["(create|add).*?something"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Test Triggers

**Test UserPromptSubmit (Skill Activation):**
```bash
echo '{"session_id":"test","prompt":"your test prompt"}' | \
  npx tsx .claude/hooks/skill-activation-prompt.ts
```

**Test PostToolUse (File Tracking):**
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | .claude/hooks/post-tool-use-tracker.sh
{"session_id":"test","tool_name":"Edit","tool_input":{"file_path":"test.ts"}}
EOF
```

### Step 4: Refine Patterns

Based on testing:
- Add missing keywords
- Refine intent patterns to reduce false positives
- Adjust file path patterns
- Test content patterns against actual files

### Step 5: Follow Anthropic Best Practices

- ✅ Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- ✅ Use progressive disclosure with reference files
- ✅ Add table of contents to reference files > 100 lines
- ✅ Write detailed description with trigger keywords
- ✅ Test with 3+ real scenarios before documenting
- ✅ Iterate based on actual usage

## Enforcement Levels

**Current Implementation Note:** This orchestrator only implements suggestion-based enforcement via UserPromptSubmit. Blocking enforcement would require PreToolUse hooks.

### SUGGEST (Recommended)

- Reminder injected before Claude sees prompt
- Claude is aware of relevant skills
- Not enforced, just advisory
- **Use For**: All skills - domain guidance, best practices, critical patterns

**Priority Levels Within SUGGEST:**
- **critical**: "⚠️ CRITICAL SKILLS (REQUIRED)" - top of suggestion list
- **high**: "📚 RECOMMENDED SKILLS" - strongly suggested
- **medium**: "💡 SUGGESTED SKILLS" - helpful guidance
- **low**: "📌 OPTIONAL SKILLS" - nice to have

### WARN (Optional)

- Low priority suggestions
- Advisory only, minimal enforcement
- **Use For**: Nice-to-have suggestions, informational reminders

**Rarely used** - most skills use "suggest" with appropriate priority levels.

### BLOCK (Not Currently Implemented)

- Would require PreToolUse hooks
- Not available in this orchestrator's current implementation
- For future enhancement if blocking enforcement is needed

---

## Skill Priority System

**How Skills Are Surfaced:**

Skills are suggested via UserPromptSubmit hook based on:
1. **Keyword matches** in user prompt
2. **Intent pattern matches** using regex
3. **File patterns** from recent edits (tracked by PostToolUse)

**Priority Display:**

```
⚠️ CRITICAL SKILLS (REQUIRED):     priority: "critical"
📚 RECOMMENDED SKILLS:              priority: "high"
💡 SUGGESTED SKILLS:                priority: "medium"
📌 OPTIONAL SKILLS:                 priority: "low"
```

**User Control:**

Since skills are suggestions (not enforced), users can:
- Choose to invoke suggested skills or not
- Rely on Claude's judgment about which skills to use
- Request specific skills manually via Skill tool

## Quick Reference Summary

### Create New Skill (5 Steps)

1. Create `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` with frontmatter
2. Add entry to `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json`
3. Test with `npx tsx` commands
4. Refine patterns based on testing
5. Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines

### Trigger Types

- **Keywords**: Explicit topic mentions
- **Intent**: Implicit action detection
- **File Paths**: Location-based activation
- **Content**: Technology-specific detection

See [trigger_types.md](trigger_types.md) for complete details.

### Enforcement

- **SUGGEST**: Inject context before prompt, most common
- **Priority levels**: critical > high > medium > low
- **WARN**: Advisory, rarely used
- **BLOCK**: Not currently implemented (would require PreToolUse hooks)

### Actual Hooks

- **UserPromptSubmit**: skill-activation-prompt.ts (suggest skills)
- **PostToolUse**: post-tool-use-tracker.sh (track file changes)

### Anthropic Best Practices

✅ **500-line rule**: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
✅ **Progressive disclosure**: Use reference files for details
✅ **Table of contents**: Add to reference files > 100 lines
✅ **One level deep**: Don't nest references deeply
✅ **Rich descriptions**: Include all trigger keywords (max 1024 chars)
✅ **Test first**: Build 3+ evaluations before extensive documentation
✅ **Gerund naming**: Prefer verb + -ing (e.g., "processing-pdfs")

### Troubleshoot

Test hooks manually:
```bash
# UserPromptSubmit (skill suggestions)
echo '{"prompt":"test"}' | npx tsx .claude/hooks/skill-activation-prompt.ts

# PostToolUse (file tracking)
echo '{"tool_name":"Edit","tool_input":{"file_path":"test.ts"}}' | \
  .claude/hooks/post-tool-use-tracker.sh
```

See [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) for complete debugging guide.
