# DeltaScience: The Grounding Layer (scan → gap → verify)

## Purpose

Ground an AI-assisted research idea or draft against the **real record**, in three moves:

1. **Scan** — find the closest existing work (prior art) across OpenAlex, arXiv, PubMed, GitHub.
2. **Gap** — judge whether that space is crowded, contested, or open, and name the distinguishing angle.
3. **Verify** — check every citation against the source of truth: does the identifier resolve, does the metadata match, does the cited paper actually support the claim?

## The one rule that governs everything: no LLM in the trust path

There are two kinds of work here, and they are *not* symmetric:

- **Discovery (scan, gap) is yours.** You are the LLM. Write the queries, judge which results are genuinely relevant, reason about where the gap is. A weak discovery pass can only make you *miss* a paper — it cannot make a false statement about what exists — so your judgement is welcome here.
- **Trust (verify) is the engine's.** A citation is real, and supports its claim, **only when `deltasci verify` says so.** Never assert from memory that a PMID/DOI is valid or that a paper supports a claim. The engine fetches the live record and decides deterministically. This is the entire point of the tool: the verdict must not depend on a model that can hallucinate agreement.

If you ever catch yourself about to write "this citation looks correct" without having run `deltasci verify`, stop and run it.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install deltasci          # core engine (keyless)
pip install 'deltasci[pdf]'   # add PDF support for whole-paper input
```

The engine is deterministic and needs **no API key**. All three commands emit `--json`.

## Inputs

| Input | How |
|-------|-----|
| A research idea / abstract | pass the text |
| A paper or draft PDF | pass the path with `--pdf` |
| A related-work snippet with citations | pass the text to `verify` |

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Frame the idea

Read the idea or the paper's title + abstract. Identify, in the field's *standard* vocabulary:
- the **problem** (e.g. "long-horizon sparse-reward credit assignment"),
- the **technique** (e.g. "group-based reinforcement learning for LLM agents"),
- the **application / domain**.

**Critical:** find the paper's own **coined names** — its method, system, or benchmark names (e.g. a made-up acronym like `SkillEvo`, `WebArena-Lite`) — and **set them aside. Never search for them.** No other work uses those terms, so they return nothing and poison a query. This is the single most common reason a scan finds "no prior art" for a hot area.

### Step 2 — SCAN: you write the queries, the engine fetches real records

Write 3–5 search queries, most-specific first, collectively covering problem + technique + application, using canonical terms and synonyms. Then issue them with the explicit-query primitive:

```bash
deltasci scan \
  --query "llm agent reinforcement learning skill" \
  --query "long-horizon sparse reward credit assignment" \
  --query "group relative policy optimization GRPO" \
  --json
```

- For a non-biomedical idea, drop PubMed: `--sources openalex,arxiv,github`.
- `--limit 20` for a wider net.

Every hit in the JSON is a **real, retrieved record** (title, authors, year, venue, url). Read them and **rerank by genuine relevance** — judge by *meaning*, not shared words. A paper that merely shares vocabulary but solves a different problem is not close. Do **not** invent or embellish any record; only use what the engine returned.

If `failed_sources` is non-empty, a corpus was slow/rate-limited — note it as a coverage gap (the run is incomplete, not empty).

### Step 3 — GAP: reason, grounded only in the retrieved works

From the real hits, classify the space:

- **CROWDED** — strong, direct prior art exists; the researcher should read it before building.
- **CONTESTED** — adjacent work exists; a distinguishing angle is needed.
- **OPEN** — little direct prior art.

Ground every statement in the listed works, naming them by author and year. State what the works already cover and the one **distinguishing angle** the idea leaves open. Never invent a paper to fill the story.

**Honesty rule on absence:** you may call CROWDED or CONTESTED freely (you can't un-find a close match). But only call **OPEN** if the scholarly sources (OpenAlex / arXiv / PubMed) actually answered. If one failed, the space is **INCONCLUSIVE — re-run**, never "open." Absence of evidence from a source that didn't respond is not evidence of an open gap.

Optional deterministic cross-check (density-based, keyless):

```bash
deltasci gap --query "llm agent reinforcement learning skill" --json
```

### Step 4 — VERIFY: the deterministic engine, never you

For any draft, related-work section, or paper that *contains citations*, run the engine. Do not eyeball them.

```bash
# A whole paper (parses the bibliography, checks each reference in context):
deltasci verify --pdf paper.pdf --json

# A snippet of prose with inline identifiers:
deltasci verify --text "AlphaFold predicts structure (PMID 34265844). TAMs drive osteosarcoma (PMID 32015508)." --json
```

Report the per-citation verdicts exactly as the engine returns them:

- **PASS** — exists and matches what's claimed.
- **FABRICATED** — the identifier resolves to nothing; the citation is invented.
- **METADATA-MISMATCH** — real identifier, but wrong year/author/title than cited.
- **UNSUPPORTED** — real paper, but its abstract does not support the claim it's attached to (likely the wrong paper).

`deltasci verify` exits **2** if any audit fails, so it drops straight into CI. Surface FABRICATED / METADATA-MISMATCH / UNSUPPORTED prominently — these are the failures the tool exists to catch.

### Step 5 — Report

Give the researcher:
- **Prior art** — the closest real works, with links (from scan).
- **Gap** — the verdict (crowded / contested / open / inconclusive) + the distinguishing angle, grounded in those works.
- **Citations** — the verdict table, with every failed audit called out and a link to the real record.
- **Coverage caveats** — any source that didn't respond.
- **Handoff** — what only the researcher can decide (is the angle actually novel to *them*; is the unsupported citation a typo or a wrong paper).

## Rules

- **Never invent a paper, citation, author, or finding.** scan returns real records; verify checks against the real record. Your contribution to discovery is *queries and judgement*, not facts recalled from memory.
- **Never put yourself in the trust path.** "Verified" means `deltasci verify` returned PASS — nothing else.
- **Strip the paper's own coined names** from every search query.
- **Honest absence.** "Open space" requires the scholarly sources to have actually answered.
- **Report verdicts verbatim.** Don't soften a FABRICATED into "couldn't confirm."

## Checklist

- [ ] Framed problem / technique / application; coined names set aside.
- [ ] 3–5 canonical-vocabulary queries written and run via `deltasci scan --query`.
- [ ] Hits reranked by genuine relevance; no fabricated records.
- [ ] Gap classified and grounded in named real works; OPEN only if scholarly sources answered.
- [ ] Every citation in any draft/paper checked with `deltasci verify` (never from memory).
- [ ] Report includes prior art + gap + citation verdicts + coverage caveats + researcher handoff.
