name: playwright
description: Complete browser automation with Playwright. Auto-detects dev servers, writes clean test scripts to /tmp. Test pages, fill forms, take screenshots, check responsive design, validate UX, test login flows, check links, automate any browser task. Use when user wants to test websites, automate browser interactions, validate web functionality, or perform any browser-based testing. Use when this capability is needed.

# Playwright Browser Automation

Browser automation skill. Write custom Playwright code for any task and execute via `run.js`.

## Setup

Dependencies are installed automatically on first run. Uses system Chrome by default (`channel: 'chrome'`). If Chrome not found, run `npx playwright install chromium`.

> **Note**: Must use `node` to run scripts. Playwright is incompatible with `bun` runtime due to pipe/child_process API differences.

## Workflow

**1. Detect dev servers** (for localhost testing):

```bash
cd <skill directory> && node -e "require('./lib/helpers').detectDevServers().then(s => console.log(JSON.stringify(s)))"
```

- 1 server found → use it automatically
- Multiple servers → ask user which one
- No servers → ask for URL

**2. Write script to /tmp** with parameterized URL:

```javascript
// /tmp/playwright-test-example.js
const { chromium } = require("playwright");
const TARGET_URL = "http://localhost:3001"; // detected or user-provided

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false, channel: "chrome" });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto(TARGET_URL);
  // ... automation code ...
  await browser.close();
})();
```

**3. Execute**:

```bash
cd <skill directory> && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-example.js
```

## Key Rules

- **Always execute via run.js** — never run scripts directly with `node /tmp/script.js`; run.js resolves dependencies from skill directory
- **Always detect servers first** for localhost testing
- **Write to /tmp** - never to skill directory or user's project
- **Use `headless: false`** by default — Playwright is typically used when sites have Cloudflare/bot protection that blocks simpler fetch methods; headless browsers are easily detected
- **Parameterize URLs** with `TARGET_URL` constant

## Helpers

Optional utilities in `lib/helpers.js`:

```javascript
const helpers = require("./lib/helpers");

await helpers.detectDevServers(); // Find running dev servers
await helpers.safeClick(page, selector); // Click with retry
await helpers.safeType(page, selector, text); // Type with clear
await helpers.takeScreenshot(page, name); // Timestamped screenshot
await helpers.handleCookieBanner(page); // Dismiss cookie popups
await helpers.extractTableData(page, selector); // Get table as JSON
```

## Patterns

See [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md) for common patterns:

- Basic page test
- Responsive design testing
- Login flow
- Form submission
- Broken links check
- Screenshot with error handling
- Inline execution

## Tips

- Use `slowMo: 100` to make actions visible
- Use `waitForURL`, `waitForSelector` instead of fixed timeouts
- Always use try-catch for robust automation
- Use `console.log()` to track progress

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                    | Solution                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cannot find playwright   | Must execute via `run.js`, not directly with `node script.js`    |
| Browser doesn't open     | Check `headless: false`, ensure display available                |
| Element not found        | Add `await page.waitForSelector('.element', { timeout: 10000 })` |
| bun errors with pipes    | Use `node` instead of `bun` (Playwright incompatible with bun)   |
| Cloudflare/bot detection | Use `headless: false` (default) — most sites detect headless     |
