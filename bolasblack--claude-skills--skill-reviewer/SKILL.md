# Skill Reviewer

Reviews skills against official best practices from Anthropic's skill authoring guide.

## Review Workflow

### 1. Create TodoWrite Checklist

Create systematic checklist from official quality checklist (see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#official-quality-checklist)):

```javascript
TodoWrite([
  // Core Quality (10 items from official checklist)
  {content: "Description specific with key terms", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking description specificity"},
  {content: "Description includes what + when", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying what and when clauses"},
  {content: "SKILL.md body under 500 lines", status: "pending", activeForm: "Counting SKILL.md lines"},
  {content: "Additional details in separate files", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking file organization"},
  {content: "No time-sensitive information", status: "pending", activeForm: "Scanning for dates/versions"},
  {content: "Consistent terminology throughout", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying terminology"},
  {content: "Examples concrete not abstract", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking example quality"},
  {content: "File references one level deep", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking reference depth"},
  {content: "Progressive disclosure used appropriately", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying progressive disclosure"},
  {content: "Workflows have clear steps", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking workflow clarity"},

  // Code and Scripts (8 items if scripts present)
  {content: "Scripts solve problems not punt to Claude", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking script purpose"},
  {content: "Error handling explicit and helpful", status: "pending", activeForm: "Reviewing error handling"},
  {content: "No voodoo constants (all justified)", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking for magic numbers"},
  {content: "Required packages listed and verified", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying dependencies"},
  {content: "Scripts have clear documentation", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking script docs"},
  {content: "Forward slashes only in paths", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking path format"},
  {content: "Validation steps for critical operations", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking validation"},
  {content: "Feedback loops for quality tasks", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking feedback loops"},

  // Testing (4 items)
  {content: "At least three evaluation scenarios", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking evaluations"},
  {content: "Tested with Haiku Sonnet Opus", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking model testing"},
  {content: "Real usage scenarios tested", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking real-world tests"},
  {content: "Team feedback incorporated", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking feedback integration"}
])
```

Mark items as they are verified.

### 2. Validate YAML Frontmatter

Verify name, description, and allowed-tools fields meet requirements. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#yaml-frontmatter-validation) for detailed specifications.

### 3. Count SKILL.md Lines

Run `wc -l SKILL.md` to count lines. Target: **Under 500 lines**. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#skillmd-length-guidelines) for remediation if over limit.

### 4. Evaluate Description Quality

Verify description includes specific capabilities, file types, when clause, and uses third person voice. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#description-field-requirements) for good/bad examples.

### 5. Check Progressive Disclosure

Verify file references are one level deep from SKILL.md. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#progressive-disclosure-pattern) for structure patterns.

### 6. Verify Content Quality

Check for concise writing, consistent terminology, concrete examples, and no time-sensitive information. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#content-quality-standards) for detailed standards.

### 7. Check Workflows

Verify workflows have clear sequential steps with checklists and feedback loops. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#workflow-requirements) for examples.

### 8. Review Scripts (if present)

Verify scripts solve problems (don't punt), have no magic numbers, clear execution intent, and documented dependencies. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#script-quality-standards) for detailed standards.

### 9. Verify File Paths

Check all paths use forward slashes (not Windows backslashes). See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#path-conventions).

### 10. Check Naming Conventions

Verify skill name uses gerund form (verb + -ing) when possible. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#name-field-requirements) for conventions.

### 11. Assess Degree of Freedom

Evaluate if specificity matches task fragility. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#degree-of-freedom).

### 12. Test Discovery

Based on description, suggest 3-5 test queries:

**Example**: If description mentions "PDF", "extract", "forms":
- "Extract text from this PDF"
- "Fill out this PDF form"
- "Merge these PDF documents"

Skill should activate for these queries.

## Provide Structured Feedback

```markdown
## Skill Review: [skill-name]

### Line Count
SKILL.md: XXX lines (target: <500)

### ✓ Passes Official Checklist
- [Items that meet official requirements]

### ✗ Issues Found

**Critical**:
- SKILL.md body: 650 lines (must be under 500)
- Description missing when clause

**Major**:
- References nested too deep (SKILL.md → advanced.md → details.md)
- Windows-style paths in scripts section
- Time-sensitive information: "Before 2025, use v1 API"

**Minor**:
- Name not in gerund form: `commit-message` → `generating-commit-messages`
- Description uses second person: "you" → third person

### 🔧 Recommended Fixes

1. **Reduce SKILL.md length** (650 → <500 lines):
   - Move examples to `examples.md`
   - Move API reference to `references/api.md`
   - Keep only core workflow in SKILL.md

2. **Fix description**:
   - Current: "Helps create commit messages"
   - Should be: "Generates descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes."

3. **Flatten file references**:
   - Move content from `advanced.md → details.md` directly into `details.md`
   - Reference from SKILL.md: `See [details.md](details.md)`

### Test Queries
Based on description, test activation with:
- "[query using description keywords]"
- "[another test query]"
