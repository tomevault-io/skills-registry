## Goal
Move posts from Inbox → Approved, optionally → Scheduled, based on workspace governance and scheduling preferences.

## Which Agent Types Use This
- **reviewer** — Primary use case (human-guided approvals or auto-approvals after triage)
- **custom** — User-defined agents with approval permissions

## Hard Rules
1. Must have Editor or Admin role (only these roles can approve).
2. Scheduling requires additional permission (`posts:schedule` capability).
3. Never publish directly — this skill routes to `approved` or `scheduled`, NOT `published`.
4. Respect per-post metadata:
   - If post has `suggested_time` in metadata, use it (unless overridden)
   - If post has `do_not_schedule` flag, skip scheduling even if requested
5. If Safe Mode ON: scheduling is separate action after approval.
6. If Safe Mode OFF: approval can include scheduling in one step.

## Steps

### 1. Check policy & capabilities
- `bolta.get_workspace_policy(workspace_id)` → extract `safe_mode`
- `bolta.get_my_capabilities(workspace_id)` → verify `review:approve` and `posts:schedule`
- If missing `review:approve`: fail immediately (unauthorized)

### 2. Load post metadata
- For each `post_id`:
  - `bolta.get_inbox_item(post_id)` → fetch post content, current state, suggested_time, metadata
  - Verify state is `inbox` (can't approve what's not in inbox)
  - Extract `suggested_time` from metadata if present

### 3. Approve posts (Inbox → Approved)
- For each post_id:
  - `bolta.approve_post(post_id)`
    - On success: post transitions to `approved` state
    - Add to `approved_ids`
    - If agent_id provided: add comment `bolta.add_comment(post_id, "Approved by {agent.name}")`
  - On failure (permission denied, invalid state):
    - Add to `failed` array with reason
    - Continue with remaining posts

### 4. Route to Scheduled (if requested)

**If schedule_mode == "approve_only":**
- Stop here. Posts remain in `approved` state.
- Human can schedule them later manually.
- `final_states[post_id] = "approved"`

**If schedule_mode == "use_suggested_time":**
- For each approved post:
  - If post has `suggested_time` in metadata:
    - Validate time (must be future, > now + 5 minutes)
    - `bolta.schedule_post(post_id, suggested_time)`
    - On success: add to `scheduled_ids`, `final_states[post_id] = "scheduled"`
    - On failure: add to `failed`, post remains `approved`
  - Else (no suggested_time):
    - Add warning: "No suggested_time, post remains approved"
    - `final_states[post_id] = "approved"`

**If schedule_mode == "set_fixed_time":**
- Requires `fixed_time` parameter
- For each approved post:
  - `bolta.schedule_post(post_id, fixed_time)`
  - On success: add to `scheduled_ids`
  - On failure: add to `failed`, post remains `approved`

**If schedule_mode == "use_agent_memory":**
- Requires `agent_id`
- `bolta.recall(agent_id, "best_posting_times")` → get learned optimal times
- For each approved post (index i):
  - Pick schedule time from agent memory
  - `bolta.schedule_post(post_id, calculated_time)`
  - On success: add to `scheduled_ids`
  - On failure: add to `failed`, post remains `approved`

**If schedule_times array provided:**
- Must match length of `post_ids`
- For each post (index i):
  - `bolta.schedule_post(post_ids[i], schedule_times[i])`
  - On success: add to `scheduled_ids`
  - On failure: add to `failed`, post remains `approved`

### 5. Handle scheduling failures gracefully
- If platform API fails (Twitter down, account disconnected):
  - Post remains in `approved` state
  - Add to `failed` with specific error
  - Don't revert approval (human can retry scheduling later)
- If schedule time invalid (past, too soon):
  - Add to `failed` with validation error
  - Post remains `approved`

### 6. Update agent memory (if agent context)
- If `agent_id` provided:
  - `bolta.remember(agent_id, "last_approval_batch_size", post_ids.length)`
  - `bolta.remember(agent_id, "approval_success_rate", success_count / total_count)`
  - If scheduling used: `bolta.remember(agent_id, "scheduled_times_used", schedule_times)`

## Output
```json
{
  "approved_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"],
  "scheduled_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2"],
  "failed": [
    {
      "post_id": "uuid3",
      "reason": "Platform API error: Twitter rate limit exceeded",
      "recoverable": true
    }
  ],
  "final_states": {
    "uuid1": "scheduled",
    "uuid2": "scheduled",
    "uuid3": "approved"
  }
}
```

## Failure Handling
- **Partial approval failure:** If some posts fail to approve, continue with others.
- **Partial scheduling failure:** If some fail to schedule, others still succeed.
- **Never revert approvals:** Once approved, post stays approved even if scheduling fails.
- **Bulk operation resilience:** One failure doesn't block the batch.

## V2 Agent Context

**When agents use this skill:**

**Reviewer agent reasoning:**
> "I triaged 8 inbox items and identified 5 as ready to approve. I'll approve them with schedule_mode=use_agent_memory to use the posting times I've learned perform best."

**Key workflow:**
1. `bolta.inbox.triage` → identify ready items
2. `bolta.review.approve_and_route` → approve + schedule
3. `bolta.remember` → store approval patterns

## Example Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Human Manual Approval (No Scheduling)
```json
{
  "workspace_id": "uuid",
  "post_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"],
  "schedule_mode": "approve_only"
}
```
**Result:** 3 posts → `approved` state, human schedules them later

### Scenario 2: Bulk Approve & Schedule with Suggested Times
```json
{
  "workspace_id": "uuid",
  "post_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"],
  "schedule_mode": "use_suggested_time"
}
```
**Result:** 3 posts approved → scheduled using each post's suggested_time metadata

### Scenario 3: Reviewer Agent Auto-Approval
- Reviewer agent runs `bolta.inbox.triage`
- Identifies 8 posts as "ready to approve" (high confidence)
- Calls this skill with those 8 post_ids + `schedule_mode: use_agent_memory`
- Agent uses learned optimal posting times
- 8 posts → approved → scheduled
- Human reviews retrospectively

### Scenario 4: Agency Bulk Scheduling
- Agency approves 20 client posts
- Wants them all to go out at 10am tomorrow
- `schedule_mode: set_fixed_time`, `fixed_time: "2026-02-21T10:00:00Z"`
- 20 posts → approved → scheduled for same time

### Scenario 5: Partial Failure Recovery
- Approve 5 posts, schedule 5
- 2 scheduling calls fail (Twitter API down)
- Output: 5 approved, 3 scheduled, 2 failed (but still approved)
- Human can retry scheduling the 2 later when Twitter is back
