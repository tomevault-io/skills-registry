# Defining Issues

Explores the codebase and converts a vague request into a grounded definition. For complex tasks, researches industry solutions and produces a design.

Does NOT implement code, create PRs, or make architectural changes. Output is definition (always) and design (L-scope only).

## Phase 1: Definition

```
NO SOLUTION LANGUAGE — DEFINE THE PROBLEM, NOT THE FIX
```

### Step 1: Background & Context

- Describe the domain, system, or user scenario
- Include history or prior attempts if known
- Keep factual — no editorializing or solution advocacy

### Step 2: Issue Statement

- Precise engineering language and codebase terminology
- No subjective, aspirational, or solution-proposing language
- Single paragraph

### Step 3: Current State

- List exact file paths (verify with `Glob` or `Read`)
- Include line numbers for specific functions or definitions
- Describe current behavior, not desired behavior
- If section exceeds 30 lines, summarize and move details to a reference appendix
- If nothing relevant exists: "No existing implementation found."

### Step 4: Non-Goals

When in doubt, mark it a non-goal.

- What is explicitly out of scope
- What parts of the system must NOT be redesigned
- What adjacent issues are intentionally excluded

### Step 5: Open Questions

Each item must include a default so downstream work can proceed.

Format: `Question? (default: answer)`

### Step 6: Scope

Assess the size of the work:

- **S** — single file, <30 lines, known pattern, clear solution
- **M** — 2-3 files, some ambiguity but existing patterns apply
- **L** — new subsystem, novel problem, multiple viable approaches

State the scope with a one-sentence justification referencing the current state.

### Step 7: Validate Definition

| Check | Criteria |
|---|---|
| Background & Context | Factual, no editorializing or solution advocacy |
| Issue Statement | Precise, single paragraph, no solution words ("should", "need to", "by adding X") |
| Current State | Real file paths verified with `Glob`/`Read`, current behavior only |
| Non-Goals | Specific exclusions, conservative scope |
| Open Questions | Each has a `(default: answer)` |
| Scope | S/M/L with justification referencing current state |

If any check fails, return to the failing step and revise.

### Save Definition

Save to `docs/issues/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/definition.md`:

```markdown
## Background & Context

## Issue Statement

## Current State

## Non-Goals

## Open Questions

## Scope
```

Missing any section invalidates the output.

**If scope is S or M**: definition is complete. Proceed to `executing-tasks`.

**If scope is L**: continue to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Design (L-scope only)

```
NO DESIGN DECISION WITHOUT A CITED REFERENCE
```

### Step 8: Research

1. **Web search**: Engineering blogs, technical articles, documentation
2. **GitHub**: Open-source implementations, issues, PRs showing patterns

Prioritize primary sources from companies that have solved this at scale. Use at least 3 distinct search queries.

Rules:
- At least 3 references, each with a URL you actually visited
- Verify each URL loads via `WebFetch` before including — if verification fails after 2 attempts, note as "unverified" and move on
- Do NOT fabricate URLs
- Quality over quantity — 3 highly relevant references beat 5 tangential ones

### Step 9: Industry Baseline

- Common/default solution and widely adopted patterns
- Trade-offs and known limitations
- Cite references by title

### Step 10: Research Summary

- Key patterns across sources
- Which approaches fit the current issue and codebase
- What research suggests about the issue's open questions

### Step 11: Design Goals & Non-Goals

**Design Goals** — derive from issue statement, order by priority. Each must be **verifiable**: a measurable metric or testable assertion.

**Non-Goals** — inherit all from definition, add any discovered during research.

### Step 12: Proposed Design

- Reference specific files/modules from definition's current state
- Explain key decisions and why alternatives were rejected (cite research)
- Include interface definitions or data flows where helpful
- Every decision traces to a design goal
- Pseudocode acceptable; implementation code is not

### Step 13: Validate Design

| Check | Criteria |
|---|---|
| References | 3+ entries with URLs (verified or marked "unverified") |
| Industry Baseline | Cites references by title, no speculation |
| Design Goals | Verifiable, trace to issue statement |
| Non-Goals | All inherited items from definition included |
| Proposed Design | Every decision traces to a goal, no implementation code |

If any check fails, return to the failing step and revise.

### Save Design

Save to `docs/issues/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/design.md`:

```markdown
## References

## Industry Baseline

## Research Summary

## Design Goals

## Non-Goals

## Proposed Design
```

Missing any section invalidates the output.

## Anti-patterns

### Definition
- ❌ "We need to add X" → ✓ "No X exists"
- ❌ "The system lacks X" (solution wearing a mask) → ✓ "Behavior Y occurs because Z"
- ❌ "There is no caching layer" (implies one is needed) → ✓ "Queries hit the database on every request; p95 latency is Nms"
- ❌ Listing systems not affected → ✓ only code paths exhibiting the issue
- ❌ "Not changing unrelated code" → ✓ specific exclusions
- ❌ "Should we log?" → ✓ "Should we log? (default: no)"

**Solution language test**: Re-read the Issue Statement. If removing it would make a reader think "so what?", it describes a problem. If removing it would make a reader think "OK, so we won't build that" — it describes a solution. Rewrite.

### Design
- ❌ "Most apps probably use X" → ✓ "PDF.js uses X (PR #7793)"
- ❌ `keys.filter(k => ...)` → ✓ "Collect keys ending with suffix"
- ❌ Unverified URLs → ✓ every URL visited via `WebFetch`
- ❌ Features not traced to goals → ✓ every decision references a goal

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "I'll suggest a solution in the background section"
- "This issue is obvious, I can skip the codebase scan"
- "The open questions don't need defaults"
- "This is clearly L-scope" (without checking current state for existing patterns)
- "This pattern is common enough, I don't need a reference"
- "I'll skip URL verification, it's a well-known source"
- "The definition didn't mention this, but I'll add it to the design"
- "I'll include implementation code to make it clearer"

**All of these mean: STOP. Revisit the step and follow the process.**
