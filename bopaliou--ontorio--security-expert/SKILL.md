# Security Expert

This skill enables Gemini CLI to perform comprehensive security audits and implement robust remediation strategies for web applications, with a focus on Laravel.

## Security Audit Workflow

Follow these steps when tasked with a security audit or hardening a specific module:

### 1. Ingestion & Discovery
- Identify the target files (Controllers, Models, Routes, Middlewares).
- Review `references/owasp-top-10.md` for common vulnerability patterns.
- Review `references/laravel-hardening.md` for framework-specific best practices.

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis
Perform a deep scan of the code looking for:
- **Missing Authorization**: Routes or controller methods without `authorize()` or permission middleware.
- **Insecure Input Handling**: Lack of validation or use of `$request->all()`.
- **Potential Injections**: Raw SQL, unescaped Blade output, or unvalidated URLs (SSRF).
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Plaintext storage, logging of PII, or insecure file access.

### 3. Remediation Planning
- Propose a clear fix for each identified issue.
- Prioritize fixes based on risk (e.g., Broken Access Control > Code Style).
- Ensure the fix follows modern best practices (e.g., using signed URLs for sensitive files).

### 4. Implementation
- Apply the fixes using the `replace` tool.
- Implement security-enhancing features (e.g., `ActivityLogger`, `SecurityHeaders`).
- Clean up any legacy or insecure patterns identified during the audit.

### 5. Verification
- Run existing tests to ensure no regressions.
- Propose new security-focused tests if applicable.

## Advanced Security Integration

### Secure File Access
When serving sensitive files (CNI, documents), always use the **Signed URL pattern**:
1. Create a signed route in `web.php`.
2. Implement a controller method that validates the signature and returns the file from protected storage.
3. Use a helper to generate temporary signed URLs.

### Activity Logging
Log all sensitive operations (logins, deletions, permission changes) using an `ActivityLogger`.
