description: Use when reviewing code changes to dispatch parallel specialized reviewers instead of a single monolithic review — provides deeper, more precise findings across focused lenses. Invoke as: /sp-cr-battery [min-score] [--security|--no-security] [--mode=bug-fix|feature] (optional 1.0–10.0 quality threshold, default 7.0; default 9.2 in Bug Fix Review Mode). Bug Fix Mode auto-activates on hotfix/* and fix/TICKET-* branches.

# Code Review Battery

> **Wrong skill?** File-protocol review handoff → `code-review`. PR inline → `providing-code-review`. Pre-commit gate → `progressive-code-review-gate`. Full-repo security audit → `repo-security-scan` or `/sp-devsec-audit`. **Slash commands:** `/sp-cr-battery [min-score]` (primary; optional 1.0–10.0 quality threshold, default 7.0), `/sp-deepreview` (legacy).

Dispatch up to 6 specialized reviewer agents in parallel, each focused on a distinct set of review dimensions. A triage coordinator selects which reviewers to activate based on the diff, then aggregates findings into a unified report.

**Why this exists**: A single reviewer tries to evaluate everything simultaneously, leading to shallow coverage, inconsistent focus, and ~40% false positive rates. Specialized reviewers with focused prompts produce deeper analysis with near-zero false positives.

## When to Use

- When `requesting-code-review` or `progressive-code-review-gate` triggers a review
- When you want a thorough review of staged changes, a commit range, or a PR diff
- When reviewing someone else's code
- When `verification-before-completion` detects the implementation→presentation transition and no valid sentinel exists for HEAD

**Gate chain position 3 of 4:**

| Gate (order) | Self-fires when | Short-circuit if |
|---|---|---|
| 1. `debate` | About to commit to a design before coding | Already ran this session |
| 2. `progressive-harsh-review` | About to present a non-code deliverable | Already ran on this artifact |
| **3. `code-review-battery`** | **About to present/commit/push code** | **Valid sentinel for HEAD exists** |
| 4. `verification-before-completion` | About to write any results-presenting response | Sentinel SHA == HEAD → skip re-dispatch |

**One-per-unit rule:** Battery fires at most once per coherent unit of work. If a valid `.code-review-cleared` sentinel exists for HEAD, the gate is already satisfied — do not re-dispatch.

## Procedure

### Phase 0: Sentinel Check (canonical skip gate — run before dispatching anything)

This is the canonical skip gate for the one-per-unit rule. Callers (`requesting-code-review`, `finishing-a-development-branch`, `progressive-code-review-gate`) should run this before dispatching. If a caller does not implement Phase 0 explicitly, the agent should apply this decision manually before invoking battery.

```bash
SENTINEL="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo .)/.code-review-cleared"
cat "$SENTINEL" 2>/dev/null || echo "NO CLEARANCE"
echo "HEAD: $(git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null)"
git diff --quiet && git diff --cached --quiet && echo "WORKTREE_CLEAN" || echo "WORKTREE_DIRTY"
```

| Sentinel state | Decision |
|----------------|----------|
| `NO CLEARANCE` | Run battery (proceed to Phase 1). |
| Sentinel SHA ≠ HEAD SHA | Run battery (battery is stale). |
| Sentinel valid for HEAD but `WORKTREE_DIRTY` | Run battery (staged/unstaged changes exist that were not reviewed). |
| Valid sentinel for HEAD AND `WORKTREE_CLEAN` | **Skip.** Battery already ran on the current code. Note the clearance and skip to Phase 6. |
| Malformed | Delete `.code-review-cleared`, run battery. |

### Phase 0.5: BugPath Mode Detection

Run immediately after the sentinel check. Detect whether this is a targeted bug fix, then set the mode before triage.

```bash
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "")
# Matches: hotfix/*, fix/<TICKET>-* where <TICKET> prefix is configured in
# .cr-battery-ticket-prefixes (one uppercase prefix per line, e.g. "PROJ").
# run-battery.sh reads that file and builds the regex at runtime.
if echo "$BRANCH" | grep -qE '^(hotfix/|fix/[A-Z]+-[0-9]+)'; then
  echo "BugPath Mode: ACTIVE (branch: $BRANCH)"
else
  echo "BugPath Mode: INACTIVE"
fi
```

| Signal | BugPath Mode trigger |
|--------|---------------------|
| Branch prefix `hotfix/*` | Active |
| Branch prefix `fix/<TICKET>-*` | Active |
| Explicit flag `--mode=bug-fix` | Active |
| Explicit flag `--mode=feature` | Inactive (overrides branch detection) |

**When BugPath Mode is active:**
- **BugPath Verifier** is added to the activated reviewer set (mandatory — not skippable via `--skip`)
- Default threshold raises from 7.0 to **9.2** unless `--min-score` is explicitly provided
- Path-coverage floor applies to the score (see Phase 3 scoring)
- **SCOPE-SKIP re-classification**: if the BugPath Verifier emits `SCOPE-SKIP` on a confirmed bug-fix branch (`hotfix/*` or `fix/TICKET-*`), the orchestrator must surface this as an **Important** finding: `"BugPath Verifier SCOPE-SKIP on confirmed bug-fix branch — manual path-coverage review required."` This is not an error; it is a human-review flag. The score floor is not applied, but the Important finding lowers the aggregate score by 1.5.

**Output the executive summary as the absolute first element of your review** — before triage, before findings, before anything else. Use the exact box format from Phase 3. This is the adoption contract: any engineer reads the first 4 lines and knows the verdict.

State the mode prominently in the executive summary and triage line:
```markdown
**BugPath Mode: ACTIVE** | Branch: fix/incident-2026-1507 | Threshold: 9.2 | BugPath Verifier: mandatory
```

Also support `--mode=bug-fix` (explicit flag, same as confirmed branch prefix) and `--mode=feature` (explicit opt-out: disables BugPath Mode even on hotfix/* branches).

### Phase 1: Triage

Analyze the diff and select reviewers:

| Reviewer | Focus | Activate When |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Defect Finder** | Correctness, edge cases, concurrency | Any code change |
| **Design Critic** | Factoring, complexity, API design | Adds/modifies classes, functions, public APIs |
| **Guardian** | Security, blast radius, backwards compat | Any code change |
| **Standards Enforcer** | Docs, test quality, observability | Always |
| **Performance Analyst** | Performance, logging | DB, loops, caching, network I/O, or >500 LOC |
| **AttackerPersona** | Credential-flow, AI-agent boundary, ident-vs-value, cookie/session, revival re-validation, CWE tagging | Any security signal (see `reference.md`) or `--security` flag |
| **BugPath Verifier** | Root cause, fix coverage, sibling bugs, regression test | BugPath Mode active (see Phase 0.5) — mandatory, not skippable |
| **Monolith** (on-demand) | All dimensions | `--all` flag or manual request |

**Decision rules:** Docs-only → Standards Enforcer only. Config-only → Guardian (+ Standards Enforcer / Defect Finder only if a metric/alarm or other dispatch signal below is present). Any code → Defect Finder + Guardian + Standards Enforcer + conditionally Design Critic and Performance Analyst.

**Signal-driven dispatch** (additive — a signal activates its reviewer(s); it never deactivates one already selected above). Scan the diff for these signals and route accordingly:

| Diff signal | Reviewer(s) | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Metric/counter/event definition, or `.emit(`/`.inc(`/`publish(` call | Defect Finder + Standards Enforcer | Producer Trace, metric liveness, emission symmetry |
| Alarm/threshold definition, or an error branch that emits a metric or feeds an alarm | Guardian + Standards Enforcer | Alarm-feeding isolation, failure-mode differentiation, multi-provider coverage |
| External-dependency call / SDK error classifier (429, 5xx, provider error shapes) | Guardian | Multi-provider predicate coverage, monitoring blast radius |
| Field set to `null`/`0`/`false`/reset | Defect Finder + Guardian | Consumer trace, cross-cutting regressions |
| Public signature / interface / message schema / shared type change | Design Critic + Guardian | API design, backward compat |
| Loop over I/O, DB query, cache, network call, or >500 LOC | Performance Analyst | N+1, payload bloat, blocking I/O |
| File rename/move/delete | Guardian (inbound-reference focus) | Broken external consumers |
| Test-only change | Standards Enforcer (+ Defect Finder for revert-safety) | Mock fidelity, revert-safety |
| Security-class signal (caller-supplied URL, dynamic SQL identifier, new MCP tool/IPC, secret read, cookie/session, `_disabled/` revival) | AttackerPersona | Credential-flow, AI-agent boundary, ident-vs-value; tags + threat-model severity multiplier |

When no signal and no default activates a reviewer, skip it and say why in the triage line.

**Mandatory activation (not subject to triage exclusion):**

- **Guardian** is ALWAYS activated when changes touch: retry logic, circuit breakers, rollback behavior, deployment config, feature flags, authentication/authorization, or state machine transitions.
- **Design Critic** is ALWAYS activated in Standard Mode when changes touch: interfaces, public APIs, contracts, message schemas, shared state types, or cross-module boundaries.

**Design Critic in Bug Fix Mode (SUPPRESSED by default):** In Bug Fix Mode (BugPath Verifier active), Design Critic is **skipped by default** and only re-activated when the diff contains API-change signals:

```bash
# API-change signals that re-activate Design Critic in Bug Fix Mode:
git diff HEAD~1 | grep -qE '^\+.*(export (default )?(class|interface|type|function|const)|public [a-zA-Z]+\()'
```

If any API-change signal matches: activate Design Critic and prefix the triage line with `⚠️ Design Critic re-activated on bug fix (API-change signal detected).`
If no signal matches: skip Design Critic and state `Design Critic: SKIPPED (Bug Fix Mode — no API-change signals)` in the triage line.

**Overrides:** `--all` (force all), `--only=<name>`, `--skip=<name>`, `--round1-only` (skip escalation), `--security` (force AttackerPersona on), `--no-security` (force AttackerPersona off), `--mode=bug-fix` (force Bug Fix Mode), `--mode=feature` (force Standard Mode). `--skip=BugPath Verifier` is silently ignored in Bug Fix Mode (the reviewer is mandatory).

State your triage decision before dispatching:

```markdown
**Triage**: Activated: [list] | Skipped: [list] | Reason: [1-2 sentences]
```

### Phase 2: Diff + Source Context + Dispatch

Sub-agents have NO conversation context. Pass diff + source context inline.

**1. Capture diff:** `git diff --cached`, `git diff HEAD~1`, or `git diff main..HEAD`

**2. Source context for ripple analysis** (#1 missed-finding cause = reviewing diff in isolation):

- Fields SET/RESET/NULLED → grep all READERS
- Symbols DEFINED (metrics, events, enums, error codes) → grep all PRODUCERS; zero producers = dead definition. Mandatory finding for metric/alarm-feeding signals; see Producer Trace steps 4-5 for indirect-producer downgrades and enum/error-code severity
- Threshold comparisons → grep all PRODUCERS of crossing values
- Stateful code → full state type + transitions
- Changed signatures → all callers
- Cross-module calls → full callee body (or signature + state-mutating/throwing/early-return branches if budget-constrained)

**3. Inbound reference scan** (mandatory when diff renames, moves, or deletes files):

```bash
git diff --diff-filter=RD --name-only main..HEAD   # old paths
grep -rn "old-filename" . --include="*.md" --include="*.ts" --include="*.sh"  # scan ENTIRE repo
```

**MUST scan outside the changed directory.** The #1 failure mode: scoping grep to the refactored directory, missing sibling modules that reference old paths. Hits outside the diff are **mandatory CRITICAL findings** — broken consumers the author didn't update. Include grep results in every reviewer's context.

**4. Dispatch ALL activated reviewers simultaneously** via `sub-agent-code-reviewer` (Augment) or `Task()` (Claude). Each gets: reviewer prompt + full diff + source context + inbound reference scan results.

### Phase 3: Aggregate

After all reviewers return:

1. Sort findings: **Critical → Important → Minor**, then by file path
2. Prefix each with `[Reviewer Name]`
3. If 2+ reviewers flag the same location, **keep both** and check for **convergence**:
   - **True convergence** (promote to at least Important): reviewers reached the finding through *different reasoning paths* — e.g., one found it via data flow analysis, another via error handling review. The evidence snippets and rationale must differ.
   - **Echo convergence** (do NOT promote): reviewers cite the same evidence snippets, use near-identical phrasing, or clearly derived their finding from the same analytical path. This indicates shared context bias, not independent validation. Keep both findings at their original severity.
4. Note clean dimensions ("✅ No issues") -- and require EACH clean-dimension verdict to carry the same `evidence` block as a finding. A "no issues" verdict without grep-verifiable evidence is treated by the verifier as `unverifiable` and caps the dimension at 7.0; this is the structural anti-confabulation gate.
5. **Severity normalization**: Re-evaluate each finding against the shared severity definitions (provided to all reviewers). Reclassify when a reviewer's label doesn't match:
   - **Critical** = broken RIGHT NOW if shipped (wrong output, data loss, crash, security hole)
   - **Important** = breaks UNDER CONDITIONS (missing guard, incomplete fix, correctness risk)
   - **Minor** = works but violates standards (style, naming, missing docs/tests, observability gaps)
   - **Elevate to Important** when the operator-visible signal is itself wrong or missing (not merely cosmetic): a dead metric or blinded alarm feeding a dashboard/alarm — treated as **live by default** unless the diff proves it is unwired — OR a separately-actionable failure cause folded into a generic metric/alarm
   - If a reviewer labeled a finding Critical but it's a process/standards gap (e.g., "no tests added"), downgrade to Important or Minor. Note the reclassification: `[Reclassified: Critical → Minor — missing tests are a standards gap, not a production defect]`
   - True convergent findings (step 3) are promoted to at least Important. Echo convergent findings retain their original severity.
6. **Triple-filter** each Important/Critical finding on CX impact, complexity, and testability, then classify:

- **Implement**: Passes all 3 filters. **Propose exact code change.**
- **Defer**: Good finding but doesn't pass all 3. Document for future work.
- **Reject**: Correct observation but fix adds more complexity than it removes.

7. For each **Implement** finding, preserve the reviewer's **Regressions Risked** and **Durable Check** fields in the report. If multiple reviewers truly converge on the same finding (different reasoning paths), merge their regression analyses and pick the most actionable durable check.

**Tightening**: If total findings >10, suppress Minor findings from the report body. Still count them in the summary line. Never suppress Critical or Important. State "Tightening applied: [N] Minor findings suppressed" in the report.

**Report format**: Executive Summary → Header (activated/skipped reviewers) → Critical → Important → Minor (full, or "[N] Minor findings suppressed") → Clean Dimensions → Action Classification table → Durable Checks summary → Live Metrics → Summary (`Findings: [N] Critical, [N] Important, [N] Minor ([N] suppressed) | Metrics: durable=[N]% or N/A, convergent-count=[N], unresolved-critical=[N]`).

**Executive Summary template** (MANDATORY — first element of every review output):

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MODE: Bug Fix Review [9.2 threshold]  |  BRANCH: fix/proj-1234  │
│  VERDICT: REJECT [6.5/10]  |  2 Critical, 1 Important, 3 Minor   │
│  ACTION: Fix 2 Critical findings. DO NOT merge.                   │
│  BugPath Coverage: INSUFFICIENT (2/4 dimensions) → cap 6.5       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Standard mode variant (no BugPath row):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MODE: Standard Review [7.0 threshold]  |  BRANCH: feat/new-api   │
│  VERDICT: PASS [8.5/10]  |  0 Critical, 1 Important, 2 Minor      │
│  ACTION: Address Important finding before merge (non-blocking).    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

VERDICT choices: `PASS`, `PASS_WITH_NITS`, `PASS_WITH_FIXES`, `REJECT`. ACTION is a single plain-English sentence: what the author must do right now.

**Metrics**: Durable check rate (≥50%), convergent finding count, unresolved Critical count (target: 0). Offline: precision ≥75%, high-sev precision ≥80%, Round 2 yield ≤20%.
**Score** (after all fix rounds): `10.0 − (Critical×2.5) − (Important×1.5) − (Minor×0.25) − (durable<50% ? 0.5 : 0)`, floor 0.0. Calibration: 0 findings → 10.0; 1 Important → 8.5; 1 Critical → 7.5; 2 Importants + low durable → 6.5. Extract threshold from invocation (e.g. `/sp-cr-battery 8.5` → 8.5; default 7.0 or 9.2 in BugPath Mode). Score < threshold → abort Phase 6.

**BugPath Mode path-coverage floor** (BugPath Mode only — applied after standard formula): Extract `path_coverage` from the BugPath Verifier's structured output. Apply the cap: `INSUFFICIENT` (<3/4 dimensions verified) → cap aggregate at **6.5**; `PARTIAL` (3/4 verified) → cap at **8.0**; `FULL` (all 4 verified) → no cap. `SCOPE-SKIP` or `N/A` → no floor applied.

### Phase 4: Escalation (Round 2)

If ANY trigger fires after Round 1, re-dispatch a focused reviewer:

| Trigger | Re-run | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| >2 state/flag findings | Defect Finder (interaction-path focus) | Systemic timing/ordering |
| >3 test quality issues | Standards Enforcer (mock-focused) | Shared mock infrastructure |
| >50 lines removed or functions deleted | Guardian (deletion focus) | Callers may depend on removed behavior |
| Files renamed/moved/deleted without inbound scan | Guardian (inbound-reference focus) | Broken consumers outside the changed directory |
| "Pre-existing" issues flagged | Defect Finder (lifecycle focus) | Deeper structural gaps |
| Diff adds/changes a metric or alarm definition, or an error-handling branch that emits a metric or feeds an alarm | Standards Enforcer (observability-completeness focus) | Dead definitions, Success/Failure asymmetry, undifferentiated failure modes |

Re-dispatch with focused instruction (diff slice + refreshed context + trigger signal). Append under `### Round 2 Findings`. Skip if `--round1-only`, all clean, or diff <20 lines.

### Phase 5: Convergence

**STOP** when: unresolved Critical = 0, last 2 passes <20% new high-sev, durable ≥50%. **CONTINUE** if escalation trigger fires or Critical remains. **ESCALATE TO HUMAN** after 3 passes.

### Correlated-Failure Detection

After synthesis, scan all reviewer outputs for **shared blind spots**:

1. **Evidence overlap check:** If ≥3 reviewers cite the same evidence snippets (same file + same line range) for their ONLY findings, flag `⚠️ CORRELATED EVIDENCE — reviewers may share a blind spot outside the cited region`. Expand the review scope to adjacent modules.
2. **Phrasing similarity check:** If 2+ reviewers use near-identical phrasing for different findings (copy-paste reasoning), flag `⚠️ ECHO REASONING — findings may reflect shared analytical bias, not independent analysis`. Require at least one reviewer to re-examine from a different entry point.
3. **Clean-sweep suspicion:** If ALL reviewers report zero findings, flag `⚠️ UNANIMOUS CLEAN — verify reviewers examined different evidence slices`. Check that each reviewer's output references different source files or code paths.

Correlated-failure flags do NOT change verdicts directly — they trigger expanded scope or re-examination. The goal is to surface shared blind spots, not to manufacture findings.

### Phase 6: Finalize Verdict + Write Sentinel

**Prerequisite:** Correlated-Failure Detection has completed and no re-examination was triggered.

**Preserve the run (before sentinel write):**

1. Determine the verdict from this MR's score vs threshold: PASS if score >= threshold; PASS_WITH_NITS if at or above threshold but nits flagged; REJECT or PASS_WITH_FIXES otherwise.
2. Write a JSON envelope to `.cr-battery-runs/<HEAD-sha>.json` (per-engineer durable record; the directory is gitignored).

Schema (run envelope wrapping Phase 3 findings):

```json
{
  "run_timestamp": "<ISO 8601 UTC>",
  "head_sha": "<git rev-parse HEAD>",
  "verdict": "PASS | PASS_WITH_NITS | PASS_WITH_FIXES | REJECT",
  "score": 9.30,
  "rounds": 1,
  "bugpath_verdict": {
    "path_coverage": "FULL | PARTIAL | INSUFFICIENT | SCOPE-SKIP | N/A",
    "dimensions": {
      "root_cause": "VERIFIED | UNVERIFIABLE | MISSING",
      "fix_coverage": "VERIFIED | PARTIAL | MISSING",
      "sibling_scan": "VERIFIED | FOUND-N | MISSING",
      "regression_test": "VERIFIED | MISSING"
    },
    "score_cap": null
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "reviewer": "Defect Finder",
      "dimension": "Correctness",
      "severity": "important",
      "file": "src/foo.ts", "line": 42,
      "issue": "...", "regressions_risked": "...", "durable_check": "...",
      "claim": "no producer for Metrics.Success",
      "evidence": {
        "command": "grep -rcE 'Metrics\\.Success' src/ | awk -F: '$2>0' | head -1",
        "expectation": { "type": "absent" },
        "verifiable": true,
        "rationale": "if any line is emitted, a producer exists"
      }
    }
  ],
  "clean_dimensions": [
    {
      "reviewer": "Standards Enforcer",
      "dimension": "Tests",
      "claim": "no new test files outside tests/",
      "evidence": {
        "command": "git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A main..HEAD -- '*.test.ts' ':!tests/'",
        "expectation": { "type": "absent" },
        "verifiable": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Every finding AND every clean-dimension verdict MUST carry an `evidence` block. `verifiable: false` is reserved for genuine judgment claims (race conditions, design smells) that cannot be re-executed deterministically; such claims are capped at 7.0 by the verifier, not falsified.

**Expectation types:** `count` (e.g. `">0"`, `"==0"`), `exit_code` (integer), `match` (regex applied to stdout, max 256 chars), `absent` (passes iff stdout has zero non-blank lines), `exact` (string equality after trim).

**Verifier replay:** `tools/run-battery.sh` invokes `tools/verify-cr-battery-evidence.js` on the freshly-written envelope when in Bug Fix Mode (mandatory) or when `.cr-battery-runs/` exists in Standard Mode (graceful degrade: skipped if directory absent). The verifier re-executes every `evidence.command`, compares observed output to the declared expectation, and caps each `(reviewer, dimension)` on falsification (5.0) or unverifiable (7.0) claims. Any FALSIFIED claim aborts the sentinel write. Exit codes: `0` all-verified-or-unverifiable; `1` at least one falsification; `2` usage/IO/parse error.

`tools/run-battery.sh` refuses to write the sentinel if the per-HEAD JSON is missing in Bug Fix Mode. In Standard Mode, the check is gracefully degraded (skipped if `.cr-battery-runs/` is absent). See `docs/cr-battery/finding-lifecycle-design.md` for the deferred lifecycle work.

If final verdict is `PASS` or `PASS_WITH_NITS` (all nits resolved):

```bash
# tools/run-battery.sh is the ONLY permitted way to write .code-review-cleared.
tools/run-battery.sh --verdict PASS --min-score <threshold>
```

> ❌ **Never write `.code-review-cleared` directly with `echo`.** Use `tools/run-battery.sh`.

**Timing:** If battery runs pre-commit, the sentinel becomes stale after commit -- re-run before push. The pre-push hook validates sentinel SHA against the pushed ref; without a valid sentinel the push is blocked.

If verdict is `REJECT` or `PASS_WITH_FIXES`: do NOT write the sentinel. Fix all Critical/Important findings, re-dispatch, then write sentinel when the re-run passes.

### Gap Analysis + Error Handling
Monolith found something no specialist found → candidate pattern → `candidates/`. Reviewer fails → note, don't retry. Diff >3000 lines → warn, suggest chunks. Empty diff → skip.

## Anti-Patterns

See `reference.md` for the 5 anti-patterns (all-agree, duplicates, fatigue, missing-context, over-scoping) with detection + correction columns. Moved to the companion file to keep this skill under the per-skill line budget.

## Failure Modes

See `reference.md` for the 4 standard failure modes (no-findings, FPs-from-isolation, convergence-stuck, monolith-vs-specialist) with fixes. Moved to the companion file alongside the Anti-Patterns table.
