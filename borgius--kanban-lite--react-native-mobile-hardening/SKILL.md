# React Native Mobile Hardening

Use this skill when the goal is to **test, harden, and de-risk** Kanban Lite mobile changes before they surprise users in the field. Small bugs become big bugs once a worker is offline, gloved up, and standing in the rain.

## When to Use

Use when the task mentions any of these ideas:

- React Native testing or Expo validation
- mobile regression checks for iOS or Android
- safe area, navigation, gesture, keyboard, or bottom-dock issues
- deep links, QR flows, restore gate, or wrong-workspace/wrong-user recovery
- offline sync, pending resend, conflict review, or stale-cache bugs
- camera, attachment capture, upload states, or QR scanning
- performance, startup time, jank, list scrolling, or render churn
- release hardening, preview builds, EAS profiles, or app identity checks

## Focus Areas

Always test these risk areas first:

1. **Protected-content safety**
   - no stale task flash during restore, reauth, workspace switch, deep links, or QR entry
   - cache purge behavior when workspace, subject, or session no longer match

2. **Offline truthfulness**
   - explicit resend for comments, forms, checklist intents, and attachment drafts
   - no silent replay of unsafe server mutations
   - clear `Pending`, `Needs connection`, and conflict states

3. **Field-worker ergonomics**
   - safe area clearance
   - large touch targets
   - one obvious primary action in the thumb zone
   - outdoor-readable contrast and short recovery copy

4. **Cross-platform correctness**
   - iOS and Android navigation behavior
   - deep links and scheme handling
   - keyboard overlap, gesture interactions, and back behavior

## Procedure

1. **Run the repo-supported validation set first.**
   - `pnpm --filter @kanban-lite/mobile run lint`
   - `pnpm --filter @kanban-lite/mobile run doctor`
   - `pnpm --filter @kanban-lite/mobile run start -- --offline --clear --port 8088`
   - `cd packages/mobile && APP_VARIANT=development pnpm exec expo config --json`
   - `cd packages/mobile && APP_VARIANT=preview pnpm exec expo config --json`

2. **Walk the highest-risk product flows.**
   - cold start and restore gate
   - `My Work` and `Due`
   - task detail
   - deep-link open
   - QR open
   - account/logout/recovery

3. **Exercise every mutation state, not just the happy path.**
   - comments: create, edit, delete, pending, resend
   - attachments: take photo, scan document, choose file, discard draft, remove synced attachment
   - forms: edit, save draft, submit, validation error
   - checklist: show, add, edit, delete, check, uncheck, conflict review
   - named actions: allowed online, denied, and offline-disabled

4. **Check capability and visibility behavior.**
   - hidden task means no task UI, not a disabled shell
   - denied mutation capability means hidden control, not a teasing disabled button
   - allowed-but-offline means either explicit local draft or a clear disabled state

5. **Profile the mobile experience for friction.**
   - look for unnecessary re-renders, long list jank, layout jumps, and oversized media work
   - verify the sticky action dock does not fight the keyboard or safe area
   - check that loading and sync states are calm instead of noisy or duplicated
   - prefer simple, stable interactions before adding fancy transitions

6. **Re-check release and app identity assumptions.**
   - `app.config.ts` and `eas.json` must agree on variant handling
   - preview and development identifiers should remain coexistence-safe
   - release changes should not assume production readiness beyond the current staged contract

7. **Document any failure by class, not just by symptom.**
   - safety issue: stale flash, wrong-workspace content, auth leakage
   - offline issue: pending state lies, silent replay, missing resend review
   - platform issue: iOS only, Android only, keyboard/gesture/back behavior
   - performance issue: slow startup, scroll jank, heavy image flow, repeated renders

## Hardening Checklist

Use this quick pass before calling a change done:

- restore gate never shows protected content too early
- deep links and QR routes validate workspace and session before task detail mounts
- safe area and bottom action dock work on iOS and Android
- offline sync states are explicit and truthful
- camera and attachment flows preserve durable local drafts when needed
- checklist, forms, comments, and actions respect capability gates
- preview/development config still resolves cleanly from Expo config

## Avoid

Avoid these release-footguns:

- treating lint success as sufficient mobile validation
- testing only online happy paths
- assuming browser auth behavior maps directly to Expo
- hiding a denial or mismatch bug behind cached content
- queuing destructive offline actions without explicit user review
- changing release profiles without re-checking variant-specific identifiers

## Done When

The mobile change is hardened when:

- correctness, offline behavior, and protected-content safety were all exercised
- iOS and Android interaction details were checked intentionally
- performance regressions were considered, not merely hoped away
- Expo validation and variant config still align with the repo contract
- release confidence comes from verified flows, not vibes
