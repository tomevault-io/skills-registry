# Fix PR Comments

Automatically address feedback from GitHub pull request comments.

## What it does

1. **Reads PR comments**: Uses `/pr:get-details` skill to fetch and display all comments (both PR-level and code review comments) from the current pull request
2. **Filters addressed comments**: Skips comment threads where the last reply starts with "Claude Replied:" (these have already been addressed)
3. **Parses feedback**: Analyzes each unresolved comment to understand what needs to be fixed
4. **Reads affected files**: Uses the Read tool to examine files mentioned in comments
5. **Applies fixes**: Makes the necessary code changes using the Edit or Write tools
6. **Commits and pushes changes**: Uses the `/git:commit` skill to stage, commit with a descriptive message, and push changes to the remote branch
7. **Replies to comments**: Uses `gh api -X POST repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies` to reply directly to each review comment thread, confirming the fix. **IMPORTANT**: All replies must start with "Claude Replied:" to mark the thread as resolved and prevent re-triggering

## Prerequisites

**Check PR Status:**
!`if [ -s /tmp/.pr_status ]; then echo "[OK] PR exists: $(cat /tmp/.pr_status)"; else echo "[WARN] No PR created yet"; fi`

**Before proceeding, verify PR exists:**
```bash
if [ ! -s /tmp/.pr_status ]; then
    echo "[ERROR] No PR has been created yet."
    exit 1
fi
```

- Must be run in a git repository
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Must have write access to the repository
- Pull request must exist for the current branch
- Requires `/pr:get-details` skill to be available
- Requires `/git:commit` skill to be available

## Technical Details

- Uses `/pr:get-details` skill to fetch both PR-level and code review comments in a formatted way
- The `/pr:get-details` skill internally uses `gh pr view` and `gh api` to gather all comment information
- **Identifying addressed comments**: A comment thread is considered addressed if its last reply starts with "Claude Replied:"
- Only processes unresolved comments (those without "Claude Replied:" in the last reply)
- Uses `/git:commit` skill to stage, commit, and push changes to the remote branch
- Replies use `gh api -X POST repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies` to thread responses
- **Reply Format**: All replies must start with "Claude Replied:" to mark threads as resolved
- Handles multiple comments in a single run

## Notes

- The command will process all unresolved review comments on the PR
- **Identifying resolved comments**: If a comment thread's last reply starts with "Claude Replied:", it means the comment has been addressed and will be skipped
- Each fix is committed separately for better tracking
- Replies are added to the specific comment thread, not as new top-level comments
- **Reply Format**: All comment replies must start with "Claude Replied:" to prevent the monitoring system from re-triggering on already-handled feedback
- The monitoring system automatically filters out threads with "Claude Replied:" in the last reply
