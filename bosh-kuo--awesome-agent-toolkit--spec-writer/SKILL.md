You are an expert Software Engineer and System Analyst. Your goal is to write a **Feature Specification Document** (Spec) for a specific page or functionality. 

### Core Philosophy: Code as the Single Source of Truth
The most critical rule is that **the code is the absolute truth**. When writing a spec, you must:
1.  **Analyze Provided Code**: Deeply trace the provided code (frontend components, hooks, backend controllers, services, etc.) to understand the actual behavior.
2.  **Contextual Reasoning**: If certain logic is missing from the prompt's description but exists in the code, the code's implementation determines the spec.
3.  **Cross-Reference**: Ensure that the functional description in the spec matches the actual logic implementation in the codebase.

## Benchmarks for a Good Spec

- **Conciseness**: Keep it brief and focused. Avoid fluff.
- **Functional Focus**: Focus on *what* the system does and *why*, rather than the low-level *how* (technical implementation details like variable names or specific library calls should be omitted unless they define a business rule).
- **Alignment**: The document should be easily understood by PMs, Designers, Developers, and QA.
- **Rules & Logic**: Emphasize business rules, edge cases, and user flows.
- **Readability**: Use tables for rules, validation, and error mapping.

## Writing Process & Guidelines

### 1. Identify the Project Type
Before writing, determine the project scope to select the appropriate sections from the template:
- **Frontend-Only**: Focus on UI/UX, interactions, states, and design system alignment. (Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)
- **Backend-Only**: Focus on logic flow, data processing, and API contracts. (Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 6)
- **Full-stack**: Include both UI interactions and API/System integration. (All Sections)
- **Other (ML, CLI, etc.)**: Adapt as needed, focusing on data flow and logic rules.

### 2. Drafting the Spec
Use `references/spec-template.md` as the foundation. Maintain consistent section headers.

| Section                 | Importance | Notes                               |
| :---------------------- | :--------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **1. Overview**         | Mandatory  | Define the "Why" and "What".        |
| **2. User/System Flow** | Mandatory  | Use Mermaid for complex logic.      |
| **3. Functional Rules** | Mandatory  | Validation, limits, and edge cases. |
| **4. Interaction**      | Adaptive   | Essential for Frontend.             |
| **5. Integration/API**  | Adaptive   | Essential for Backend/Full-stack.   |
| **6. Error Handling**   | Mandatory  | Map errors to user feedback.        |

### 3. Execution Steps
1.  **Read the Prompt**: Understand the user's intent and identify the target feature.
2.  **Trace the Code**: 
    - Trace the provided code paths.
    - Follow imports/calls to understand peripheral dependencies.
    - Identify hidden business rules (e.g., a regex in a schema, a conditional return in a hook).
3.  **Draft the Doc**: Fill in the template based on your findings.
4.  **Refine**: Remove technical jargon that doesn't contribute to functional understanding.

## File Naming & Location

Save all specifications in the `docs/specs/` directory using the following naming convention:
`{feature-or-page-name}-spec.md`

Examples:
- `user-login-spec.md`
- `dashboard-analytics-spec.md`
- `order-processing-spec.md`

## Reference Guide by Project Type

When generating a spec, refer primarily to the example that matches the type of feature you are writing about to maintain consistency in depth and focus:

| Project Type          | Key Focus                        | Best Reference Example                          |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend-Only**     | Interaction, State, UI, Feedback | `examples/theme-editor-frontend-spec.md`        |
| **Backend-Only**      | API Contracts, Logic Flow, Jobs  | `examples/notification-service-backend-spec.md` |
| **Full-stack (Auth)** | Auth flow, JWT, Multi-role logic | `examples/login-spec.md`                        |
| **Full-stack (Data)** | CRUD, Permissions, Lists         | `examples/account-management-spec.md`           |

- Use `examples/theme-editor-frontend-spec.md` for tools, editors, or heavy interactive dashboards.
- Use `examples/notification-service-backend-spec.md` for microservices, background workers, or CLI tools.
- Use `examples/login-spec.md` and `account-management-spec.md` for typical web applications with both UI and Data Persistence.
