# Using Xcode CLI

## Overview

Native Xcode CLI tools (`xcodebuild` and `xcrun simctl`) provide full control over iOS/macOS builds and simulators without opening Xcode IDE. **Core principle:** Use CLI for automation, headless builds, and CI/CD—the same tools Xcode uses internally.

## When to Use

- Building iOS/macOS apps from command line
- Running apps in iOS Simulator programmatically
- Taking screenshots or recording video of simulator
- Running unit/UI tests with specific targeting
- Automating builds in CI/CD pipelines
- Managing simulator instances (boot, shutdown, erase)
- Simulating location, push notifications, or permissions
- Capturing app logs for debugging

**Symptoms that trigger this skill:**
- "Unable to find destination matching"
- "No scheme named X found"
- "xcodebuild: error:"
- Need to automate Xcode workflows
- Building without opening Xcode IDE

## When NOT to Use

- Editing code or project settings → Use Xcode IDE
- Managing Swift Package dependencies → Use `swift package` CLI
- Cross-platform builds → Use platform-specific tools
- Signing/provisioning profile management → Use Xcode or fastlane

## Quick Start

**Find available simulators:**
```bash
xcrun simctl list devices available
```

**Build for simulator:**
```bash
UDID=$(xcrun simctl list devices --json | jq -r '.devices | .[].[] | select(.name=="iPhone 16 Pro" and .isAvailable==true) | .udid' | head -1)
xcodebuild -workspace App.xcworkspace -scheme App -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,id=$UDID" -derivedDataPath /tmp/build build
```

**Install and launch:**
```bash
APP_PATH=$(find /tmp/build -name "*.app" -type d | head -1)
xcrun simctl install $UDID "$APP_PATH"
xcrun simctl launch --console $UDID com.bundle.identifier
```

**Take screenshot:**
```bash
xcrun simctl io $UDID screenshot /tmp/screenshot.png
```

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| List schemes | `xcodebuild -workspace App.xcworkspace -list` |
| List simulators | `xcrun simctl list devices available` |
| Get simulator UDID | `xcrun simctl list devices --json \| jq ...` |
| Boot simulator | `xcrun simctl boot $UDID` |
| Build for simulator | `xcodebuild ... -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,id=$UDID" build` |
| Install app | `xcrun simctl install $UDID /path/to/App.app` |
| Launch app | `xcrun simctl launch --console $UDID com.bundle.id` |
| Take screenshot | `xcrun simctl io $UDID screenshot /tmp/shot.png` |
| Run tests | `xcodebuild ... test` |
| Stream logs | `/usr/bin/log stream --predicate 'processImagePath CONTAINS "App"'` |

## Reference Documentation

| Reference | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| [xcodebuild.md](reference/xcodebuild.md) | Project discovery, building, archiving, testing |
| [simctl.md](reference/simctl.md) | Device management, screenshots, video, location, permissions |
| [logging.md](reference/logging.md) | Log streaming and filtering predicates |
| [workflows.md](reference/workflows.md) | End-to-end automation scripts |

## Common Patterns

### Build + Run
1. Find simulator UDID via `simctl list devices --json`
2. Boot simulator with `simctl boot $UDID`
3. Build with `xcodebuild` using `-derivedDataPath`
4. Find .app bundle in derived data
5. Install with `simctl install`
6. Launch with `simctl launch --console`

### Run Tests
```bash
xcodebuild -workspace App.xcworkspace -scheme App \
  -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,id=$UDID" \
  -only-testing "AppTests/SpecificTest" test
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "Unable to find destination" | Verify simulator exists with `simctl list devices`. Use exact name or UDID. |
| "No scheme found" | Run `xcodebuild -list` to see available schemes. Ensure you're using `-workspace` or `-project` flag. |
| "App not found after build" | Use `-derivedDataPath /tmp/build` and search there with `find`. |
| Simulator not responding | Try `xcrun simctl shutdown all` then boot fresh. |
| Build succeeds but app crashes | Check `xcrun simctl launch --console` for runtime errors. |
| Tests hang indefinitely | Add `-destination-timeout` flag. Ensure simulator is booted first. |
| Wrong simulator selected | Always use UDID from `simctl list devices --json`, not device name alone. |
| Stale build artifacts | Use `clean build` action or delete derived data directory. |
