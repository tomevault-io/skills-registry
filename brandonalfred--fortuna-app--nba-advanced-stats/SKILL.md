# NBA Stats (nba_api) — Primary NBA Data Source

The **primary** source for all NBA statistics. Returns bulk data (all ~524 players in one call), has a local player ID database (no API call needed for lookups), and doesn't consume any API quota.

## When to Use This

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Season averages (PTS, REB, AST, etc.) for any/all players | **nba-advanced-stats** (`LeagueDashPlayerStats` base mode) |
| Per-game stats for hit rate / trend analysis | **nba-advanced-stats** (`PlayerGameLog`) |
| Pace, usage rate, offensive/defensive rating | **nba-advanced-stats** (`LeagueDashPlayerStats` advanced mode) |
| Per-100-possession stats | **nba-advanced-stats** |
| Opponent defensive tendencies by position | **nba-advanced-stats** |
| Lineup combinations and net rating | **nba-advanced-stats** |
| Player tracking (speed, distance, touches) | **nba-advanced-stats** |
| True shooting %, effective FG% | **nba-advanced-stats** |
| NBA data and nba_api is down/failing | `api-sports` (fallback) |
| NFL, MLB, NHL stats | `api-sports` (only option) |

**Routing rule:** For NBA, always try `nba-advanced-stats` first. Fall back to `api-sports` or web search only if nba_api requests fail after retries.

## Setup

```python
import subprocess, sys

try:
    from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashPlayerStats
except ImportError:
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "nba_api", "-q"])
    from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashPlayerStats
```

## Proxy Configuration

NBA.com blocks cloud provider IPs. `WEBSHARE_PROXY_URL` contains a rotating residential proxy gateway URL (e.g. `http://user:pass@p.webshare.io:80/`). Each request through this gateway automatically gets a different residential IP from a 215K+ IP pool.

```python
import os

PROXY = os.environ.get("WEBSHARE_PROXY_URL", "").strip() or None

HEADERS = {
    "x-nba-stats-origin": "stats",
    "x-nba-stats-token": "true",
    "Referer": "https://www.nba.com/",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36"
}
```

## Rate Limiting & Retry Logic

The `safe_request` helper retries failed requests with delays. The residential proxy rotates IPs automatically on each attempt.

```python
import time

def safe_request(endpoint_class, max_retries=3, **kwargs):
    """Make an nba_api request with retry logic and residential proxy."""
    for attempt in range(1, max_retries + 1):
        try:
            time.sleep(2)
            endpoint = endpoint_class(
                proxy=PROXY,
                headers=HEADERS,
                timeout=30,
                **kwargs
            )
            return endpoint.get_data_frames()[0]
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Attempt {attempt}/{max_retries} failed: {str(e)[:100]}")
            if attempt < max_retries:
                time.sleep(3)
    print("All attempts failed. Falling back to web search.")
    return None
```

---

## Player & Team ID Lookup

These lookups use a **local static database** bundled with nba_api — no API call or network request needed. Handles accented characters (Jokić, Dončić) automatically.

```python
from nba_api.stats.static import players, teams

def find_player_id(name: str) -> int:
    matches = players.find_players_by_full_name(name)
    if not matches:
        parts = name.lower().split()
        matches = [p for p in players.get_players() if any(part in p["full_name"].lower() for part in parts)]
    return matches[0]["id"] if matches else None

def find_team_id(name: str) -> int:
    matches = teams.find_teams_by_full_name(name)
    if not matches:
        matches = [t for t in teams.get_teams() if name.lower() in t["full_name"].lower() or name.lower() in t["abbreviation"].lower()]
    return matches[0]["id"] if matches else None
```

## Endpoints

### 1. Season Averages — All Players (Bulk)

Returns all ~524 active players' standard box score averages in a single call. Use this as the starting point for any NBA analysis — pull once, filter in Python.

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashPlayerStats

df = safe_request(
    LeagueDashPlayerStats,
    season="2024-25",
    per_mode_detailed="PerGame"
)

# Key columns: PLAYER_NAME, TEAM_ABBREVIATION, GP, MIN, PTS, REB, AST,
#              STL, BLK, TOV, FGM, FGA, FG_PCT, FG3M, FG3A, FG3_PCT,
#              FTM, FTA, FT_PCT, OREB, DREB
```

### 2. Player Game Log (Per-Game Stats)

Per-game stats for an individual player — essential for hit rate calculation and trend analysis.

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import PlayerGameLog

player_id = find_player_id("Tyrese Maxey")
df = safe_request(
    PlayerGameLog,
    player_id=player_id,
    season="2024-25"
)

# Key columns: GAME_DATE, MATCHUP, WL, MIN, PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK,
#              TOV, FGM, FGA, FG_PCT, FG3M, FG3A, FG3_PCT, FTM, FTA,
#              FT_PCT, PLUS_MINUS
# Rows are ordered most recent first
```

### 3. Advanced Player Stats (USG%, PACE, Ratings, TS%, EFG%)

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashPlayerStats

df = safe_request(
    LeagueDashPlayerStats,
    season="2024-25",
    measure_type_detailed_defense="Advanced",
    per_mode_detailed="PerGame"
)

# Key columns: PLAYER_NAME, USG_PCT, PACE, OFF_RATING, DEF_RATING,
#              NET_RATING, TS_PCT, EFG_PCT, AST_PCT, AST_TO
```

### 4. Per-100-Possession Stats (Pace-Adjusted)

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashPlayerStats

df = safe_request(
    LeagueDashPlayerStats,
    season="2024-25",
    per_mode_detailed="Per100Possessions"
)

# Key columns: PLAYER_NAME, PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK, FGA, FG3A
# These are pace-normalized — use for fair cross-team comparisons
```

### 5. Advanced Team Stats (Pace Rankings, Efficiency)

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashTeamStats

df = safe_request(
    LeagueDashTeamStats,
    season="2024-25",
    measure_type_detailed_defense="Advanced",
    per_mode_detailed="PerGame"
)

# Key columns: TEAM_NAME, PACE, OFF_RATING, DEF_RATING, NET_RATING,
#              EFG_PCT, TS_PCT, AST_RATIO, REB_PCT
# Sort by PACE to find fastest/slowest teams
```

> **Note:** `LeagueDashTeamStats` returns `TEAM_NAME` (e.g., "Denver Nuggets"), **not** `TEAM_ABBREVIATION`. It also includes G-League affiliates — filter using the NBA team names list below.

```python
# All 30 NBA team names matching TEAM_NAME values from LeagueDashTeamStats.
# Note: nba_api uses "Los Angeles Clippers" (full name), NOT "LA Clippers" (API-Sports form).
NBA_TEAMS = [
    "Atlanta Hawks", "Boston Celtics", "Brooklyn Nets", "Charlotte Hornets",
    "Chicago Bulls", "Cleveland Cavaliers", "Dallas Mavericks", "Denver Nuggets",
    "Detroit Pistons", "Golden State Warriors", "Houston Rockets", "Indiana Pacers",
    "Los Angeles Clippers", "Los Angeles Lakers", "Memphis Grizzlies", "Miami Heat",
    "Milwaukee Bucks", "Minnesota Timberwolves", "New Orleans Pelicans", "New York Knicks",
    "Oklahoma City Thunder", "Orlando Magic", "Philadelphia 76ers", "Phoenix Suns",
    "Portland Trail Blazers", "Sacramento Kings", "San Antonio Spurs", "Toronto Raptors",
    "Utah Jazz", "Washington Wizards",
]
# Filter: df = df[df["TEAM_NAME"].isin(NBA_TEAMS)]
```

### 6. Opponent Defensive Tendencies

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashPlayerStats

df = safe_request(
    LeagueDashPlayerStats,
    season="2024-25",
    measure_type_detailed_defense="Advanced",
    opponent_team_id=find_team_id("Sacramento Kings")
)

# Filter by player to see how they perform against a specific defense
```

### 7. Lineup Analysis (Net Rating by Lineup Combination)

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import TeamDashLineups

df = safe_request(
    TeamDashLineups,
    team_id=find_team_id("Philadelphia 76ers"),
    season="2024-25",
    measure_type_detailed_defense="Advanced",
    group_quantity=5
)

# Key columns: GROUP_NAME (player names), MIN, PLUS_MINUS, NET_RATING,
#              OFF_RATING, DEF_RATING, PACE
# Use group_quantity=2 for two-man combos
```

### 8. Player Tracking Stats (Speed, Distance, Touches)

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashPtStats

df = safe_request(
    LeagueDashPtStats,
    season="2024-25",
    pt_measure_type="SpeedDistance"
)

# Key columns: PLAYER_NAME, DIST_MILES, AVG_SPEED, DIST_MILES_OFF, DIST_MILES_DEF

# For touches:
df_touches = safe_request(
    LeagueDashPtStats,
    season="2024-25",
    pt_measure_type="Possessions"
)
# Key columns: TOUCHES, FRONT_CT_TOUCHES, TIME_OF_POSS, ELBOW_TOUCHES, PAINT_TOUCHES
```

### 9. Per-Game Usage Rate (Box Score)

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import BoxScoreUsageV3

df = safe_request(
    BoxScoreUsageV3,
    game_id="0022400123"
)

# Key columns: PLAYER_NAME, USG_PCT, PCT_FGA, PCT_FGA_2PT, PCT_FGA_3PT,
#              PCT_FTA, PCT_OREB, PCT_DREB, PCT_AST, PCT_TOV
# Use for analyzing usage redistribution in specific games
```

## Betting Analysis Patterns

### Pattern 1: Hit Rate Calculation (Player Props)

Use `PlayerGameLog` + pandas to calculate how often a player clears a prop line.

```python
import pandas as pd
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import PlayerGameLog

def calculate_hit_rate(player_name: str, stat: str, line: float, season: str = "2024-25", last_n: int = None):
    """Calculate how often a player exceeds a prop line.

    Args:
        player_name: Full name (e.g., "Tyrese Maxey")
        stat: Column name — "PTS", "REB", "AST", "FG3M", "STL", "BLK", etc.
        line: The prop line to check against (e.g., 26.5)
        season: NBA season string
        last_n: If set, only use the last N games
    """
    player_id = find_player_id(player_name)
    df = safe_request(PlayerGameLog, player_id=player_id, season=season)
    if df is None or df.empty:
        return None

    if last_n:
        df = df.head(last_n)

    hits = (df[stat] > line).sum()
    total = len(df)

    return {
        "player": player_name,
        "stat": stat,
        "line": line,
        "games": total,
        "hits": int(hits),
        "hit_rate": round(hits / total * 100, 1) if total else 0,
        "average": round(df[stat].mean(), 1),
        "median": round(df[stat].median(), 1),
        "max": int(df[stat].max()),
        "min": int(df[stat].min()),
        "last_5_avg": round(df.head(5)[stat].mean(), 1),
    }
```

### Pattern 2: Trend Detection (Hot/Cold Streaks)

```python
def detect_trend(player_name: str, stat: str, season: str = "2024-25", recent_n: int = 5):
    """Compare recent performance to season average."""
    player_id = find_player_id(player_name)
    df = safe_request(PlayerGameLog, player_id=player_id, season=season)
    if df is None or len(df) < recent_n:
        return None

    recent_avg = df.head(recent_n)[stat].mean()
    season_avg = df[stat].mean()
    pct_change = ((recent_avg - season_avg) / season_avg * 100) if season_avg else 0

    return {
        "player": player_name,
        "stat": stat,
        "recent_avg": round(recent_avg, 1),
        "season_avg": round(season_avg, 1),
        "pct_change": round(pct_change, 1),
        "trend": "HOT" if pct_change > 10 else "COLD" if pct_change < -10 else "NEUTRAL",
        "last_5_values": df.head(5)[stat].tolist(),
    }
```

### Pattern 3: Bulk Parlay Screening

When building a parlay, pull bulk data first and filter programmatically instead of looking up players one at a time.

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashPlayerStats

def screen_prop_candidates(stat: str, min_games: int = 20, min_avg: float = 15.0, season: str = "2024-25"):
    """Find players who consistently hit over a stat threshold.

    Use this to narrow down parlay candidates before doing deep dives.
    """
    df = safe_request(LeagueDashPlayerStats, season=season, per_mode_detailed="PerGame")
    if df is None:
        return None

    # Filter to players with enough games and a high enough average
    candidates = df[(df["GP"] >= min_games) & (df[stat] >= min_avg)].copy()
    candidates = candidates.sort_values(stat, ascending=False)

    return candidates[["PLAYER_NAME", "TEAM_ABBREVIATION", "GP", "MIN", stat]].head(30)
```

### Pattern 4: Pace Matchup Analysis (Over/Under Impact)

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashTeamStats

def pace_matchup_analysis(team1: str, team2: str, season: str = "2024-25"):
    """Analyze pace matchup for over/under implications."""
    df = safe_request(
        LeagueDashTeamStats,
        season=season,
        measure_type_detailed_defense="Advanced"
    )
    if df is None:
        return None

    league_avg_pace = df["PACE"].mean()
    t1 = df[df["TEAM_NAME"].str.contains(team1, case=False)]
    t2 = df[df["TEAM_NAME"].str.contains(team2, case=False)]

    if t1.empty or t2.empty:
        return {"error": "Team not found"}

    t1_pace = t1.iloc[0]["PACE"]
    t2_pace = t2.iloc[0]["PACE"]
    expected_pace = (t1_pace + t2_pace) / 2

    return {
        "team1_pace": round(t1_pace, 1),
        "team2_pace": round(t2_pace, 1),
        "expected_game_pace": round(expected_pace, 1),
        "league_avg_pace": round(league_avg_pace, 1),
        "pace_delta": round(expected_pace - league_avg_pace, 1),
        "implication": "OVER lean" if expected_pace > league_avg_pace + 1 else "UNDER lean" if expected_pace < league_avg_pace - 1 else "Neutral pace",
        "team1_off_rating": round(float(t1.iloc[0]["OFF_RATING"]), 1),
        "team2_off_rating": round(float(t2.iloc[0]["OFF_RATING"]), 1),
        "team1_def_rating": round(float(t1.iloc[0]["DEF_RATING"]), 1),
        "team2_def_rating": round(float(t2.iloc[0]["DEF_RATING"]), 1),
    }
```

### Pattern 5: Usage Redistribution (Key Player Out)

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashPlayerStats

def usage_without_player(team: str, missing_player: str, season: str = "2024-25"):
    """Estimate usage redistribution when a key player is out."""
    df = safe_request(
        LeagueDashPlayerStats,
        season=season,
        measure_type_detailed_defense="Advanced"
    )
    if df is None:
        return None

    team_id = find_team_id(team)
    team_players = df[df["TEAM_ID"] == team_id].sort_values("USG_PCT", ascending=False)

    missing = team_players[team_players["PLAYER_NAME"].str.contains(missing_player, case=False)]
    if missing.empty:
        return {"error": f"{missing_player} not found on {team}"}

    missing_usg = float(missing.iloc[0]["USG_PCT"])
    missing_min = float(missing.iloc[0]["MIN"])
    remaining = team_players[~team_players["PLAYER_NAME"].str.contains(missing_player, case=False)]

    total_remaining_usg = float(remaining["USG_PCT"].sum())
    top_beneficiaries = remaining.head(5)[["PLAYER_NAME", "USG_PCT", "MIN", "PTS", "AST"]].copy()

    top_beneficiaries["PROJECTED_USG_BOOST"] = top_beneficiaries["USG_PCT"].apply(
        lambda u: round(float(u) / total_remaining_usg * missing_usg * 100, 1)
    )

    return {
        "missing_player": missing_player,
        "missing_usg_pct": round(missing_usg * 100, 1),
        "missing_minutes": round(missing_min, 1),
        "beneficiaries": top_beneficiaries[["PLAYER_NAME", "USG_PCT", "PROJECTED_USG_BOOST"]].to_dict("records"),
    }
```

### Pattern 6: Defensive Vulnerability by Position

```python
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import LeagueDashPlayerStats

def defensive_vulnerability(opponent_team: str, player_position: str = "Guard", season: str = "2024-25"):
    """Find how much a defense struggles against a specific position."""
    df = safe_request(
        LeagueDashPlayerStats,
        season=season,
        measure_type_detailed_defense="Advanced",
        per_mode_detailed="PerGame"
    )
    if df is None:
        return None

    opp_id = find_team_id(opponent_team)

    position_map = {"Guard": ["PG", "SG"], "Forward": ["SF", "PF"], "Center": ["C"]}
    positions = position_map.get(player_position, [player_position])

    opp_df = safe_request(
        LeagueDashPlayerStats,
        season=season,
        measure_type_detailed_defense="Advanced",
        opponent_team_id=opp_id,
        per_mode_detailed="PerGame"
    )

    if opp_df is None or opp_df.empty:
        return {"error": "No data for opponent filter"}

    if "PLAYER_POSITION" in opp_df.columns:
        opp_df = opp_df[opp_df["PLAYER_POSITION"].isin(positions)]

    if "PLAYER_POSITION" in df.columns:
        league_avg = float(df[df["PLAYER_POSITION"].isin(positions)]["OFF_RATING"].mean())
    else:
        league_avg = float(df["OFF_RATING"].mean()) if "OFF_RATING" in df.columns else None

    avg_off_rating = float(opp_df["OFF_RATING"].mean()) if "OFF_RATING" in opp_df.columns and not opp_df.empty else None

    return {
        "opponent": opponent_team,
        "position": player_position,
        "avg_off_rating_vs_opponent": round(avg_off_rating, 1) if avg_off_rating else "N/A",
        "league_avg_off_rating": round(league_avg, 1) if league_avg else "N/A",
        "delta": round(avg_off_rating - league_avg, 1) if avg_off_rating and league_avg else "N/A",
        "verdict": "Exploitable" if avg_off_rating and league_avg and avg_off_rating > league_avg + 2 else "Average" if avg_off_rating and league_avg and abs(avg_off_rating - league_avg) <= 2 else "Tough matchup",
    }
```

---

## Season Format

nba_api uses `"YYYY-YY"` format for seasons:

| NBA Season | nba_api Value |
|------------|---------------|
| 2024-25 | `"2024-25"` |
| 2023-24 | `"2023-24"` |
| 2022-23 | `"2022-23"` |

---

## Fallback Strategy

If nba_api requests fail after 3 retries (timeouts, rate limits):

1. `safe_request` returns `None` after exhausting retries — each retry gets a fresh residential IP automatically
2. **Fall back to `api-sports`** for the same NBA data (game logs, season stats)
3. **Web search** for the same data on Basketball Reference, Statmuse, or NBA.com
4. **Cite** that the data was sourced from a fallback rather than the primary API

Example fallback:
```
nba_api is currently unavailable. Sourcing from API-Sports instead.
# Or if API-Sports also fails:
Web search: "Tyrese Maxey stats 2024-25 basketball reference"
```

---

## Complementary Tools

| Tool | Priority for NBA | Use For |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| **nba-advanced-stats** | PRIMARY | All NBA stats — season averages, game logs, advanced metrics, pace, usage, lineup data |
| **api-sports** | FALLBACK (NBA) / PRIMARY (other sports) | NBA fallback if nba_api fails; primary for NFL, MLB, NHL |
| **odds-api** | — | Current lines and odds comparison |
| **Web search** | LAST RESORT | Injury reports, news, fallback stats if both APIs fail |
