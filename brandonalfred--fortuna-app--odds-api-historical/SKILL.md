# The Odds API - Historical Data

The `ODDS_API_KEY` environment variable is available. Use it with curl to fetch historical odds data.

**Important:** Read the API key from config before API calls:
```bash
ODDS_API_KEY=$(grep '^ODDS_API_KEY=' /vercel/sandbox/.agent-env | cut -d'=' -f2-)
```

## Critical: Query Time Strategy

**The historical endpoint only returns games that haven't started yet at the snapshot time.** This is the most common source of "missing games" issues.

**Default behavior - ALWAYS follow this:**
- **Use 10:00 AM ET (15:00 UTC)** as the snapshot time when querying a full day's games
- This ensures all games are captured before any start (earliest NBA/NFL games are ~12 PM ET)
- Only use later timestamps when specifically requesting "closing odds" for a particular game

**Why this matters:**
- Query at 6:55 PM ET → afternoon games (1 PM, 3 PM starts) are **excluded** because they've commenced
- Query at 10:00 AM ET → **all games** for that day are included

## Full Day Historical Query

When fetching historical odds for an entire day:

1. **Convert the date to 10:00 AM ET (15:00 UTC)** on the target date
2. Query with that timestamp to get all games scheduled for that day
3. If user wants closing odds: make a second query at 11:00 PM ET (04:00 UTC next day) and merge results

**Example: All NBA games on Feb 2, 2025**
```bash
# Use 10 AM ET (15:00 UTC) to capture all games before any start
curl -s "https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4/historical/sports/basketball_nba/odds/?apiKey=${ODDS_API_KEY}&regions=us&markets=h2h,spreads,totals&date=2025-02-02T15:00:00Z&oddsFormat=american"
```

## Closing Odds Query

**For closing odds of a specific game:**
- Query 30-60 minutes before its `commence_time`
- Example: Game at 7:00 PM ET → query at 6:30 PM ET (23:30 UTC)

**For closing odds of all games on a day:**
- Late games: Query at 11:00 PM ET (04:00 UTC next day)
- Early games: Query individually using their `commence_time`
- **Note**: A single late-night query will miss early games that already started

**Full day closing odds workflow:**
1. Query at 10:00 AM ET to get the list of all games with their `commence_time` values
2. For each game, query 30-60 min before its `commence_time` to get closing odds
3. Or accept that a single late query captures late games only

## Overview

- Historical data available from June 2020 (featured markets), May 2023 (additional markets)
- Snapshots captured at 5-10 minute intervals
- **Quota cost**: 10 per region per market (higher than live odds)

## Efficient Querying Tips

1. **Use event-level endpoint** when you know the specific event ID to reduce data returned
2. **Request only needed markets** - each market costs quota
3. **Navigate with timestamps** - use `previous_timestamp`/`next_timestamp` from response to walk through time
4. **Cache responses** - historical data doesn't change, so cache aggressively

## Rate Limiting

The API rate limit is 30 requests per second. To avoid 429 errors:

- **Combine markets in a single request** — use `markets=h2h,spreads,totals` instead of separate requests per market. Same applies to regions.
- **Space sequential requests** — when querying multiple events for closing odds, add a brief pause between calls rather than firing them all at once.
- **Cache aggressively** — historical data never changes. Never re-fetch the same sport/date/market combination.
- **Retry on 429** — if you get a 429 status code, wait 2-3 seconds and retry. Do not retry immediately.

## Common Use Cases

- **Line movement analysis**: Compare opening odds to closing odds
- **Sharp money detection**: Track how odds moved before game time
- **Backtesting strategies**: Test betting systems against historical odds
- **Closing line value**: Compare your bet price to final closing line
