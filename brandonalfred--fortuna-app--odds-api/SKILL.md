# The Odds API

The `ODDS_API_KEY` environment variable is available. Use it with curl to fetch data.

**Important:** Read the API key from config before API calls:
```bash
ODDS_API_KEY=$(grep '^ODDS_API_KEY=' /vercel/sandbox/.agent-env | cut -d'=' -f2-)
```

## Efficient Querying

API quota costs 1 per market per region requested. To minimize usage:

- Only request needed markets (don't request `spreads` if you only need moneyline)
- Use `bookmakers` param to filter to specific sportsbooks
- Limit regions to what's relevant (`us` for US sports, `uk` for EPL)
- Use `eventIds` param to fetch specific games instead of all

## Rate Limiting

The API rate limit is 30 requests per second. To avoid 429 errors:

- **Combine markets in a single request** — use `markets=h2h,spreads,totals` instead of separate requests per market. Same applies to regions.
- **Cache `/sports` and `/events` responses** — these don't change often. Reuse results within a session instead of re-fetching.
- **Parallelize per-event calls** — use background processes (`&` and `wait`) to fetch multiple events concurrently. The 30 req/sec limit easily handles a full night's slate. Only add pauses if fetching 30+ events.
- **Reduce frequency for empty results** — if a sport is off-season or no events are listed, don't keep polling.
- **Retry on 429** — if you get a 429 status code, wait 2-3 seconds and retry. Do not retry immediately.

## Sport Keys

> **These tables list common keys only** — the API adds and removes sport keys seasonally.
> **Championship and playoff games** (Super Bowl, NBA Finals, World Series, Stanley Cup) are listed under the main sport key (e.g., `americanfootball_nfl`), not separate keys like `americanfootball_nfl_super_bowl`.
> When unsure, query `/v4/sports/` first — **this endpoint is free** and costs zero quota.

## Markets Reference

### Featured Markets (most common)

| Market | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `h2h` | Moneyline / head-to-head winner |
| `spreads` | Point spreads / handicaps |
| `totals` | Over/under game totals |
| `outrights` | Futures / championship winner |

### Additional Markets

|--------|-------------|
| `alternate_spreads` | Alternate point spreads |
| `alternate_totals` | Alternate over/unders |
| `btts` | Both teams to score (soccer) |
| `draw_no_bet` | Draw no bet (soccer) |
| `team_totals` | Individual team totals |

### Period Markets

| Market | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `h2h_q1` | First quarter moneyline |
| `h2h_h1` | First half moneyline |
| `spreads_q1` | First quarter spread |
| `spreads_h1` | First half spread |
| `totals_q1` | First quarter total |
| `totals_h1` | First half total |

### Player Props

> **Player prop markets must be queried via the per-event endpoint (`/events/{id}/odds`), not the sport-level endpoint (`/odds`).** The sport-level endpoint returns `INVALID_MARKET` for player props. Always fetch the events list first, then loop through event IDs to get props.

#### ⚡ Bulk Player Props — Recommended Pattern

**Batch multiple prop markets in a single call per event.** Instead of separate requests for each market, combine them:

```bash
# ❌ SLOW: 4 separate calls per event (4 HTTP round-trips)
curl -s "...events/${EID}/odds?markets=player_points&..."
curl -s "...events/${EID}/odds?markets=player_rebounds&..."
curl -s "...events/${EID}/odds?markets=player_assists&..."
curl -s "...events/${EID}/odds?markets=player_threes&..."

# ✅ FAST: 1 call per event, all markets combined (same quota cost)
curl -s "...events/${EID}/odds?markets=player_points,player_rebounds,player_assists,player_threes&..."
```

The quota cost is identical (1 credit per market per region either way), but you make 1 HTTP call instead of 4.

**Fetch all events in parallel.** Use background processes to fetch every game's props concurrently:

```bash
ODDS_API_KEY=$(grep '^ODDS_API_KEY=' /vercel/sandbox/.agent-env | cut -d'=' -f2-)
SPORT="basketball_nba"
MARKETS="player_points,player_rebounds,player_assists,player_threes"
BOOKS="fanduel,draftkings"

# Step 1: Get event IDs for target date range (free — 0 quota)
# Set FROM/TO to the date range you want, e.g. tomorrow's games:
FROM=$(date -u -d '+1 day' '+%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00Z')
TO=$(date -u -d '+1 day' '+%Y-%m-%dT23:59:59Z')
EVENTS=$(curl -s "https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4/sports/${SPORT}/events/?apiKey=${ODDS_API_KEY}&commenceTimeFrom=${FROM}&commenceTimeTo=${TO}" | jq -r '.[].id')

# Step 2: Fetch all events' props in parallel
for eid in $EVENTS; do
  curl -s "https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4/sports/${SPORT}/events/${eid}/odds/?apiKey=${ODDS_API_KEY}&regions=us&markets=${MARKETS}&oddsFormat=american&bookmakers=${BOOKS}" \
    -o "/tmp/props_${eid}.json" &
done
wait

# Step 3: Read all results
for eid in $EVENTS; do
  cat "/tmp/props_${eid}.json"
done
```

**Performance:** This fetches a full NBA slate (5 games × 4 prop markets × 2 books) in ~300ms total instead of making 20+ sequential calls over several minutes.

**Also fetch game odds (spreads/totals) in the same parallel burst** for blowout risk analysis:

```bash
# Add this alongside the props fetch (runs concurrently)
curl -s "https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4/sports/${SPORT}/odds/?apiKey=${ODDS_API_KEY}&regions=us&markets=h2h,spreads,totals&oddsFormat=american&bookmakers=${BOOKS}" \
  -o "/tmp/game_odds.json" &
```

This pattern should be the **default approach** whenever fetching player props for analysis. Always batch markets and parallelize event calls.

## Response Structure

```json
{
  "id": "event-uuid",
  "sport_key": "basketball_nba",
  "sport_title": "NBA",
  "commence_time": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
  "home_team": "Los Angeles Lakers",
  "away_team": "Boston Celtics",
  "bookmakers": [
    {
      "key": "draftkings",
      "title": "DraftKings",
      "markets": [
        {
          "key": "h2h",
          "outcomes": [
            { "name": "Los Angeles Lakers", "price": -150 },
            { "name": "Boston Celtics", "price": +130 }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Compare odds across sportsbooks** - Look for the best line/price
2. **Check for line movement** - Note if odds have shifted
3. **Cite your sources** - Always mention which sportsbooks you're quoting
4. **Explain the odds** - American odds format: +150 means $100 wins $150, -150 means bet $150 to win $100

## Troubleshooting

### Empty results from an API call

Empty results (`[]`) mean the requested market does not exist for that event. This is normal, NOT a credential issue.

**Common causes:** off-season (no events), wrong market type for the game stage (e.g., `outrights` after a championship matchup is set — use `h2h,spreads,totals` instead), or invalid `eventId`.

Empty results are not a credential issue — adjust your query parameters instead.

### Unknown sport key / 404 error

**Cause:** Fabricated or guessed sport key (e.g., `americanfootball_nfl_super_bowl`). The API only accepts keys it currently lists.

**Fix:** Query `/v4/sports/` first to get valid keys — it's free and costs zero quota.

**Key rule:** Championship and playoff games (Super Bowl, NBA Finals, World Series, Stanley Cup) always use the main sport key (e.g., `americanfootball_nfl`), never a special one. Find the specific game by querying `/v4/sports/{sport_key}/events/` (also free).
