# Systematic Literature Review

> Conduct rigorous, reproducible literature searches with verified citations.

## When to Use

- Conducting systematic literature review
- Synthesizing knowledge on a topic
- Writing the PLANNING phase literature review
- Populating `.research/literature/` directory
- Updating `manuscript/background.md`
- Meta-analysis or scoping reviews
- Finding prior work on techniques

## Core Workflow

```
1. PLAN         → Define question, scope, databases
2. SEARCH       → Systematic, documented searches
3. SCREEN       → Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria
4. EXTRACT      → Pull key data from sources
5. SYNTHESIZE   → Identify themes, patterns, gaps
6. VERIFY       → Validate all citations
7. DOCUMENT     → Create reproducible record
```

## Phase 1: Planning

### Define Research Question (PICO Framework)

For clinical/biomedical topics:
- **P**opulation: Who is studied?
- **I**ntervention: What treatment/exposure?
- **C**omparison: Versus what?
- **O**utcome: What is measured?

Example: "What is the efficacy of CRISPR-Cas9 (I) for treating sickle cell disease (P) compared to standard care (C)?"

### Develop Search Strategy

```markdown
## Search Strategy for: [Topic]

### Core Concepts
1. [Primary concept] - synonyms: [alternative terms]
2. [Secondary concept] - synonyms: [alternative terms]
3. [Methodological aspect]

### Search Queries
- "[concept1] AND [concept2]"
- "[method] in [application domain]"
- "review [topic]" (for overview papers)

### Databases to Search
- [ ] PubMed (biomedical)
- [ ] bioRxiv (preprints)
- [ ] arXiv (computational, physics)
- [ ] Semantic Scholar (cross-disciplinary)
- [ ] OpenAlex (open access)
- [ ] Google Scholar (broad coverage)

### Inclusion Criteria
- Date range: [start] to [end]
- Languages: [list]
- Study types: [list]

### Exclusion Criteria
- [criterion 1]
- [criterion 2]
```

---

## Phase 2: Systematic Search

### Documenting Searches

For each database, record:

```markdown
## Database: PubMed
- **Date searched**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Date range**: [start] to [end]
- **Search string**: 
  ```
  ("CRISPR"[Title] OR "Cas9"[Title])
  AND ("sickle cell"[MeSH] OR "SCD"[Title/Abstract])
  ```
- **Results**: N articles
- **Notes**: [any filter applied]
```

### PubMed Search Tips

- Use MeSH terms: `"disease name"[MeSH]`
- Field tags: `[Title]`, `[Title/Abstract]`, `[Author]`
- Boolean: AND, OR, NOT
- Date filter: `2020:2024[Publication Date]`
- Article type: `"Review"[Publication Type]`

### bioRxiv/medRxiv

- Preprints - NOT peer-reviewed
- Check if subsequently published
- Note version and date

### Semantic Scholar / OpenAlex

- Good for citation networks
- Cross-disciplinary coverage
- Can find highly-cited papers

---

## Phase 3: Screening

### PRISMA Flow

```
Records identified (n = X)
├─ Duplicates removed (n = Y)
├─ Records screened (n = Z)
│  └─ Excluded by title/abstract (n = A)
├─ Full-text assessed (n = B)
│  └─ Excluded with reasons (n = C)
└─ Studies included (n = D)
```

### Screening Checklist

For each paper:
- [ ] Meets inclusion criteria
- [ ] Doesn't meet exclusion criteria
- [ ] Relevant to research question
- [ ] Sufficient quality (peer-reviewed, appropriate methods)

---

## Phase 4: Data Extraction

### Extract from Each Source

1. **Metadata**: Authors, year, journal, DOI
2. **Study design**: Methods, population, sample size
3. **Key findings**: Main results, effect sizes
4. **Limitations**: Noted by authors
5. **Relevance**: How it relates to your question
6. **Quality**: Assessment of rigor

### Literature Note Template

Create in `.research/literature/[topic].md`:

```markdown
# Literature Review: [Topic]

Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Search strategy: [link to search doc]

## Summary
[2-3 sentence overview of the literature landscape]

## Key Themes

### Theme 1: [Name]
[Synthesis across multiple papers - NOT paper-by-paper]

Key points:
- Point 1 (Author1, Year; Author2, Year)
- Point 2 (Author3, Year)

### Theme 2: [Name]
...

## Gaps and Controversies
- [Gap 1]: Limited research on...
- [Controversy]: Conflicting results regarding...

## Key Papers

### Author (Year) - Title
- **DOI**: 10.xxxx/xxxxx
- **Main finding**: [One sentence]
- **Relevance**: [How it relates to your work]
- **Limitations**: [Key caveats]

## References
[BibTeX or formatted references]
```

## Phase 5: Thematic Synthesis

### Do This ✓

Organize by themes, not by paper:
```
Multiple delivery approaches have been investigated. Viral vectors 
(AAV) showed high efficiency (65-85%)¹⁻¹⁵ but raised immunogenicity 
concerns³,⁷. Lipid nanoparticles demonstrated lower efficiency 
(40-60%) but improved safety¹⁶⁻²³.
```

### Don't Do This ✗

Paper-by-paper summary:
```
Smith (2020) found that viral vectors work well. Jones (2021) 
also used viral vectors. Wang (2022) tried nanoparticles...
```

### Synthesis Template

```markdown
## Thematic Synthesis

### Theme: [Name]

**Current understanding**: [Summary of what is known]

**Consensus areas**: [What most studies agree on]

**Controversies**: [Conflicting findings]

**Gaps**: [What's missing from the literature]

**Evidence quality**: [Overall assessment]
```

## Phase 6: Citation Verification

### CRITICAL: Verify All Citations

**NEVER fabricate citations.** Every claim must have a verifiable source.

### Verification Checklist

For each citation:
- [ ] DOI resolves correctly
- [ ] Author names match
- [ ] Year is correct
- [ ] Title matches
- [ ] Journal name correct

### Citation Styles

#### APA (7th Edition)
```
Smith, J. D., Johnson, M. L., & Williams, K. R. (2023). Title of article. 
Journal Name, 22(4), 301-318. https://doi.org/10.xxx/yyy
```

#### Nature
```
Smith, J. D., Johnson, M. L. & Williams, K. R. Title of article. 
Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 22, 301-318 (2023).
```

#### Vancouver
```
Smith JD, Johnson ML, Williams KR. Title of article. 
Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2023;22(4):301-18.
```

## Integration with RA Workflow

### PLANNING Phase Connection

Literature review is a gate for entering DEVELOPMENT:
- [ ] At least one literature search completed → ✓ Creates `.research/literature/` content
- [ ] background.md has at least a rough draft → Uses literature synthesis

### After Literature Review

1. Update `.research/literature/` with findings
2. Draft sections in `manuscript/background.md`
3. Add citations to `.research/literature/*.bib`
4. Log activity in `.research/logs/activity.md`
5. Update `tasks.md` with identified gaps

### Connection to Other Skills

- **→ `/write_background`**: Uses literature synthesis to draft background
- **→ `/hypothesis_generation`**: Literature informs hypothesis development
- **← `/deep_research`**: Alternative invocation for same functionality

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Single database | Misses relevant papers | Search 3+ databases |
| No documentation | Not reproducible | Record all search parameters |
| Paper-by-paper | No synthesis | Organize thematically |
| Unverified citations | Errors and fabrication | Check every DOI |
| Too broad | Thousands of results | Refine with specific terms |
| Too narrow | Misses relevant work | Include synonyms |
| Ignoring preprints | Misses latest findings | Include bioRxiv/medRxiv |
| No quality assessment | Treats all evidence equally | Assess study quality |
