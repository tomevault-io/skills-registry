## Execution Steps

### 1. Load Context (REQUIRED)

Read these files to understand current state:

```
~/.researchAssistant/researcher_telos.md  (user profile)
.research/project_telos.md                (project state, current phase)
.research/phase_checklist.md              (what's done/remaining)
.research/logs/activity.md                (recent activity)
tasks.md                                  (pending tasks)
```

Extract:
- **Current phase**: SETUP | PLANNING | DEVELOPMENT | ANALYSIS | WRITING | REVIEW
- **Recent activity**: What did they work on last?
- **Pending tasks**: What's marked as TODO or in-progress?
- **Blockers**: Any noted blockers or uncertainties?

### 2. First-Time Setup Check

**Check for researcher profile:**
```
IF ~/.researchAssistant/researcher_telos.md does NOT exist:
  - Move ./researcher_telos_template.md to ~/.researchAssistant/researcher_telos.md
  - Ask onboarding questions to populate it
  - Create ~/.researchAssistant/ directory if needed
ELSE:
  - Delete ./researcher_telos_template.md if it still exists
  - Load preferences from existing profile
```

**Check for project setup:**
```
IF .research/project_telos.md is mostly empty (mission not defined):
  - Start project onboarding flow
  - Ask: "What's this project about in 1-2 sentences?"
  - Ask: "Is this part of a larger grant?"
  - Ask: "What's your target output?"
```

### 3. Scan for Conditions

Check each condition in order of priority:

#### Critical (Check First)

- **Phase gate violations**: e.g., trying DEVELOPMENT with empty background
- **First-time setup needed**: Profile or project not configured

#### High Priority

- [ ] Uncommitted git changes > 3 days old
- [ ] New data files not yet explored (→ `exploratory-data-analysis`)
- [ ] New meeting recordings (→ `transcribe`)
- [ ] High-priority tasks in `tasks.md`
- [ ] Stale activity (>7 days since last log)

#### Medium Priority  

- [ ] Scripts without documentation (→ `review-script`)
- [ ] Figures without captions (→ `scientific-visualization`)
- [ ] Weekly review due (→ `weekly-review`)
- [ ] Empty manuscript sections appropriate to current phase

#### Low Priority

- [ ] Monday morning (→ `plan-week`)
- [ ] Orphan files or incomplete sections
- [ ] End of day (→ `wrap-up`)

### 4. Consider Phase-Appropriate Skills

Based on current phase, identify which skills are most relevant:

**PLANNING Phase Priorities:**
1. `hypothesis-generation` - Do you have a clear hypothesis?
2. `literature-review` / `deep-research` - Have you surveyed the field?
3. `write-background` - Can you articulate the problem?

**DEVELOPMENT Phase Priorities:**
1. `review-script` - Document as you build
2. `statistical-analysis` - Plan your analysis approach

**ANALYSIS Phase Priorities:**
1. `exploratory-data-analysis` - Understand your data first
2. `statistical-analysis` - Formal testing
3. `scientific-visualization` - Publication figures

**WRITING Phase Priorities:**
1. `write-methods` - Document what you did
2. `write-results` - Describe what you found  
3. `scientific-writing` - Polish and format

**REVIEW Phase Priorities:**
1. `peer-review` - Self-assessment
2. `review-script` - Code quality check
3. Final `scientific-writing` pass

### 5. Generate Recommendations

Present 2-4 options ranked by value:

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

Based on your project state (Phase: ANALYSIS, Last active: 2 days ago):

### A) [High Priority] Explore your new dataset
   I noticed `data/raw/experiment_results.csv` was added recently.
   → Run `/exploratory_data_analysis data/raw/experiment_results.csv`
   
   This will help you:
   - Understand data structure and quality
   - Identify any issues before formal analysis
   - Generate summary statistics

### B) [Medium Priority] Document your preprocessing script
   `scripts/preprocess.py` lacks docstrings.
   → Run `/review_script scripts/preprocess.py`
   
   Good documentation now saves time during methods writing.

### C) [Routine] Weekly review
   Last weekly review was 8 days ago.
   → Run `/weekly_review`

### D) [Continue] Resume from last session
   You were working on: "correlation analysis for Figure 2"
   → Continue where you left off

## Example Outputs by Phase

### PLANNING Phase /next
```
You're in the PLANNING phase. Key priorities:

A) 🟡 Generate your hypothesis
   Your project_telos.md has aims but no formal hypothesis.
   → Run `/hypothesis_generation`
   
B) 🟡 Literature review on [detected topic]
   Background.md is empty. Let's build your foundation.
   → Run `/literature_review [topic]`

C) ⚪ Quick win - capture your current thinking
   → Run `/note` to log where your head is at
```

### ANALYSIS Phase /next
```
You're in the ANALYSIS phase with new data. Priorities:

A) 🔴 Explore experiment_results.csv
   New data file detected - understand it before analyzing.
   → Run `/exploratory_data_analysis data/raw/experiment_results.csv`

B) 🟡 After EDA: Statistical analysis
   Once you understand the data, run formal tests.
   → Run `/statistical_analysis`

C) 🔵 Parallel: Document your analysis scripts
   preprocess.py and analyze.py need docstrings.
   → Run `/review_script scripts/preprocess.py`
```

### WRITING Phase /next  
```
You're in the WRITING phase. Current status:
- ✅ Background: Draft complete
- ⚠️ Methods: Partially written
- ❌ Results: Empty (but you have 3 figures!)

A) 🔴 Write your results section
   You have figures ready but no results text.
   → Run `/write_results`

B) 🟡 Complete methods documentation
   → Run `/write_methods`

C) 🔵 Scientific writing review
   → Run `/scientific_writing` on completed sections
```

## Notes

- Always be encouraging, never judgmental
- If user seems stuck, offer to break down the next step
- Remember: user may not know what commands exist - suggest them explicitly
- Update activity.md after significant interactions
