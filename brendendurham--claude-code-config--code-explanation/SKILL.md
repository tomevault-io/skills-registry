# Code Explanation Skill

Explain code clearly using ASCII diagrams, real-world analogies, and Mermaid visualizations.

## When to Use

- User asks "explain this code" or "what does this do"
- User wants to understand how something works
- User asks for architecture visualization
- User needs help understanding complex logic

## Explanation Framework

### Step 1: Quick Summary

Start with a one-sentence plain English summary:

> "This function takes a list of orders, filters out cancelled ones, calculates the total, and applies any applicable discounts."

### Step 2: Identify the Audience Level

Adjust explanation depth based on context:
- **Beginner**: Use analogies, avoid jargon, explain fundamentals
- **Intermediate**: Focus on patterns, design decisions, trade-offs
- **Expert**: Discuss edge cases, performance, alternatives

### Step 3: Break Down the Logic

Use structured sections:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this solve?
2. **Inputs**: What data comes in?
3. **Process**: What transformations happen?
4. **Outputs**: What comes out?
5. **Side Effects**: What else changes?

## ASCII Diagram Patterns

### Data Flow

```
Input          Process           Output
  |               |                |
  v               v                v
+------+    +-----------+    +--------+
| User | -> | Validator | -> | Result |
| Data |    | Function  |    | Object |
+------+    +-----------+    +--------+
                 |
                 v
            +----------+
            | Database |
            +----------+
```

### Function Pipeline

```
[Raw Data]
     |
     v
+-------------+
| Parse JSON  |
+-------------+
     |
     v
+-------------+
| Validate    |
+-------------+
     |
   +-+-+
   |   |
   v   v
 Valid Invalid
   |     |
   v     v
+----+ +-------+
|Save| |Error  |
+----+ +-------+
```

### Class Relationships

```
     +----------------+
     |   BaseClass    |
     +----------------+
     | - privateVar   |
     | + publicMethod |
     +-------+--------+
             |
     +-------+-------+
     |               |
     v               v
+----------+   +----------+
| ChildA   |   | ChildB   |
+----------+   +----------+
| + methodA|   | + methodB|
+----------+   +----------+
```

### State Machine

```
         +--------+
         | START  |
         +---+----+
             |
             v
    +--------+--------+
    |                 |
    v                 v
+-------+        +--------+
| IDLE  |<------>| ACTIVE |
+---+---+        +----+---+
    |                 |
    v                 v
+-------+        +--------+
| ERROR |        | DONE   |
+-------+        +--------+
```

### Request/Response Flow

```
Client                   Server                  Database
  |                        |                        |
  |  1. POST /users        |                        |
  |----------------------->|                        |
  |                        |  2. INSERT INTO users  |
  |                        |----------------------->|
  |                        |                        |
  |                        |  3. Return new ID      |
  |                        |<-----------------------|
  |  4. 201 Created        |                        |
  |<-----------------------|                        |
  |                        |                        |
```

## Mermaid Diagram Generation

### Flowchart

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is Valid?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Process Data]
    B -->|No| D[Return Error]
    C --> E[Save to DB]
    E --> F[Send Response]
    D --> F
    F --> G[End]
```

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as API
    participant D as Database
    participant C as Cache

    U->>A: Request Data
    A->>C: Check Cache
    alt Cache Hit
        C-->>A: Return Cached
    else Cache Miss
        A->>D: Query Database
        D-->>A: Return Results
        A->>C: Store in Cache
    end
    A-->>U: Send Response
```

### Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +String id
        +String email
        +String name
        +getProfile()
        +updateSettings()
    }
    class Order {
        +String id
        +User user
        +List items
        +calculateTotal()
    }
    class Item {
        +String id
        +String name
        +Number price
    }
    User "1" --> "*" Order : places
    Order "*" --> "*" Item : contains
```

### State Diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending
    Pending --> Processing: submit
    Processing --> Completed: success
    Processing --> Failed: error
    Failed --> Pending: retry
    Completed --> [*]
```

### Architecture Diagram

```mermaid

{Explanation with code snippet}

### 2. {Second major step}
{Explanation with code snippet}

## Analogy

Think of this like {real-world comparison}...

## Key Concepts

- **{Concept 1}**: {Brief explanation}
- **{Concept 2}**: {Brief explanation}

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is it done this way?**
A: {Explanation of design decision}

**Q: What could go wrong?**
A: {Edge cases and error scenarios}
```

## Tips

1. **Start simple**: Give the overview before diving into details
2. **Use visuals**: A diagram often explains better than paragraphs
3. **Relate to familiar concepts**: Analogies bridge the knowledge gap
4. **Show, don't just tell**: Include relevant code snippets
5. **Anticipate questions**: Address the "why" not just the "what"
