description: Log a professional experience - accomplishments, lessons, expertise, decisions, influence, or insights. Extracts context from arguments or conversation history for fast capture, or runs a full guided interview when context is sparse. Use when this capability is needed.

<purpose>
Walk the user through capturing a professional experience with enough depth and structure to be useful for resumes, interviews, and blog posts later. When the user provides rich context (pasted transcript, decision summary, or detailed description), extract fields automatically and confirm before writing. When context is sparse, fall back to a full guided interview that adapts based on the evidence type.

    <description>Load Professional Context</description>

    <action>Read the professional profile from `<home>/.things/shared/professional-profile.json` -- the `current_role`, `target_roles`, `career_direction`, `building_skills`, and `aspirational_skills` fields. This context shapes which follow-up questions to ask and how to tag the entry.</action>

    <action>Read default tags from `<home>/.things/i-did-a-thing/preferences.json`.</action>

      <description>Gather Context</description>

      <action>Collect context from two sources:</action>
      - `$ARGUMENTS`: The text the user passed directly to the skill
      - Conversation history: Prior messages in the current session that describe a professional experience

      <if condition="no-relevant-context">Jump to Step 4 (full interview).</if>

      <constraint>
      What counts as relevant context:
      - Descriptions of work done, decisions made, problems solved, lessons learned, expertise applied, influence exercised, or patterns observed
      - Project/task specifics -- codebase names, team context, stakeholder interactions, timelines, outcomes
      </constraint>

      <constraint>
      What does NOT count:
      - Code debugging sessions or casual chat that isn't about a professional experience
      - Prior skill runs (like `/practice-wdyd`) -- these are not themselves loggable events
      - Generic greetings or unrelated conversation

      - `evidence_type` -- accomplishment, lesson, expertise, decision, influence, or insight
      - `impact` -- major, notable, solid, or learning
      - `category` -- technical, leadership, communication, problem-solving, process, growth, expertise, decision-making, or influence
      - `skills_used` -- cross-reference against the user's `building_skills` and `aspirational_skills` from profile
      - Body section content -- the narrative sections for this evidence type (see the table in Step 9)

      Optional fields -- extract if present, skip if not:
      - `description` -- 1-2 sentence summary
      - `tags` -- searchable tags
      - `skills_developed` -- new skills learned or grown
      - `target_alignment` -- which professional targets this supports (from profile)
      - `role_at_time` -- the user's role when this happened
      - `team_or_org` -- team or organization context
      - `duration` -- how long this took
      - `metrics` -- quantifiable outcomes

      <constraint>Project/task context preservation: When the context references a specific project, codebase, tool, or task, capture that specificity in the body sections, in `team_or_org`, and in tags. Don't generalize away the details -- "redesigned MyApp's prompt routing system" is better than "improved a system."</constraint>

      <action>Classify each field as:</action>
