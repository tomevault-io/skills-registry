# Generate README Skills Table

Generate a markdown table listing all skills in this repository with their
descriptions.

## Usage

Run the generator script:

```bash
bun .claude/skills/generate-readme-table/scripts/generate-readme-table.ts
```

To update the README.md file directly:

```bash
bun .claude/skills/generate-readme-table/scripts/generate-readme-table.ts --write
```

## README Format

The README.md file must contain marker comments for the table to be inserted:

```markdown
<!-- SKILLS-TABLE-START -->
<!-- SKILLS-TABLE-END -->
```

The script will replace everything between these markers with the generated
table.

## Output Format

The generated table has two columns:

| Skill        | Description         |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| `skill-name` | What the skill does |

Skills are sorted alphabetically by name.

## Pre-commit Hook

A pre-commit hook script is provided to automatically regenerate the table when
SKILL.md files change:

```bash
.claude/skills/generate-readme-table/scripts/pre-commit-readme-table.sh
```

Install it in your git hooks directory or use with a hook manager like husky or
lefthook.
