# Ps-Tech Git / GitHub workflow

## Scope

- Encode **PS-Tech** defaults: linear history, **rebase** over merge for integrating work, **draft PRs early**, clean history before review, **revert** instead of rewriting shared history.
- **Read GitHub state** with **`gh`** when available (schemas first—see [reference.md](reference.md)).
- **Mutating git** (rebase, push, revert): only when the user **explicitly** asks to run commands or recover from a described situation. Do not push, force-push, merge on GitHub, approve, or comment on PRs unless the user requests it.

## Inspecting branches and PRs

1. Run from the **repository root** (or `cd` there first). If not a git repo, say so and stop there.
2. Prefer **`gh`**: `gh auth status`; then list/view PRs and checks (see [reference.md](reference.md)).
3. **Branches:** `git branch -a`, `git status`; optional `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches` if JSON is needed (`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` for owner/repo).

## Linear history and branch roles

- **`production`** and **`staging`**: staging tracks production, often with a few extra commits. Updating production means moving it **forward** to staging (conceptually), using the flows below—not merge-button shortcuts that scatter merge commits.
- **Dev branches** sit **on top of `staging`**. If `staging` advances before the feature is ready, **rebase** the dev branch onto `staging`.

## Merge vs rebase

- **Goal:** land commits onto another branch. **`git rebase`** moves your branch on top of the target and keeps history **linear**—this is the team preference.
- Avoid **`git merge`**.

## GitHub merges

- Merge buttons or `gh` actions often behave like **non–fast-forward** merges and **break linearity**. Prefer **CLI** (`git checkout`, `git rebase`, `git push`) for control.

## Rebase conflicts

1. Find conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`).
2. Fix the files.
3. `git add <file>`
4. `git rebase --continue`
5. Escape hatch: `git rebase --abort`

## Pull request etiquette

- Open a **draft PR early** so others see what you are doing.
- **Push regularly** (e.g. daily or when switching tasks) to reduce lost work.
- Mark **ready for review** and assign a reviewer when appropriate.
- Before review, **clean up** history: interactive rebase—squash, fixup, reword (`git rebase -i HEAD~X`). Aim for **one commit per feature** (often one task per feature).

## Staying current and merging (commands)

Use **`git fetch`** first; rebase onto **`origin/<branch>`** so the base is the latest **remote** tip. Full command sequences for updating dev from staging, merging dev → staging, staging → production, promotion up to a commit, excluding a middle commit, Odoo.sh trigger, reverts, and force-push policy are in [reference.md](reference.md).

## After you push: treat commits as immutable

Once others may have your commits, treat them as **immutable**. Follow-ups are **new commits** with clear **why** in the body—not silent history rewrites on shared branches.

## Commit messages

The training deck stresses a short first line and a **verbose body focused on why**. For bracketed **`[TAG]`**, **`[TASK]`**, module prefix, and the **80-character** header rule, use the project skill [commit-message-format](../commit-message-format/SKILL.md).

## Related skills

- **Commit headers and tags:** [commit-message-format](../commit-message-format/SKILL.md).
- **Full read-only PR review report** (severity, confidence, workspace validation): use the **`review-github`** skill when the user wants a production-style review; this skill focuses on **workflow and discovery/read**.

## Additional reference

- Command cheat sheets and **`gh`** read patterns: [reference.md](reference.md).
