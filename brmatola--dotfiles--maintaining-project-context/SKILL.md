# Maintaining Project Context

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `writing-claude-md-files` for all context file creation and updates.

## Core Principle

Context files (CLAUDE.md) document contracts and architectural intent. When code changes contracts, the documentation must update. Stale documentation is worse than no documentation.

**Trigger:** End of development phase, branch completion, or any work that changed contracts, APIs, or domain structure.

## When to Update Context Files

| Change Type | Update Required? | What to Update |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| New domain/module | Yes | Create domain context file |
| API/interface change | Yes | Contracts section |
| Architectural decision | Yes | Key Decisions section |
| Invariant change | Yes | Invariants section |
| Dependency change | Yes | Dependencies section |
| Bug fix (no contract change) | No | - |
| Refactor (same behavior) | No | - |
| Test additions | No | - |

## The Process

### Step 1: Identify What Changed

Diff against the base (branch start or phase start):

```bash
# Get changed files
git diff --name-only <base-sha> HEAD

# Get detailed changes
git diff <base-sha> HEAD --stat
```

Categorize changes:
- **Structural:** New directories, moved files
- **Contract:** Changed exports, interfaces, public APIs
- **Behavioral:** Changed invariants, guarantees
- **Internal:** Implementation details only

### Step 2: Map Changes to Context Files

For each significant change, determine which context file should document it:

| Change Location | Context File Location |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Project-wide pattern | Root CLAUDE.md |
| New domain | `<domain>/CLAUDE.md` (create) |
| Existing domain contract | `<domain>/CLAUDE.md` (update) |
| Cross-domain dependency | Both affected domains |

**Hierarchy rule:** Information belongs at the lowest level where it applies. Domain-specific contracts go in domain files, not root.

### Step 3: Verify Contracts Still Hold

For each affected context file, verify:

1. **Contracts section:** Do exposes/guarantees/expects match current code?
2. **Dependencies section:** Are uses/used-by/boundary accurate?
3. **Invariants section:** Are all invariants still enforced?
4. **Key Decisions section:** Any new decisions to document?

```bash
# Find domain's public exports
grep -r "export" <domain>/index.ts

# Find domain's imports (dependencies)
grep -r "from '\.\." <domain>/
```

### Step 4: Update or Create Context Files

**For updates:**
1. Read existing file first
2. Update freshness date via `date +%Y-%m-%d`
3. Update affected sections
4. Remove stale content
5. Verify under token budget (<100 lines for domain files)

**For new domains:**
1. Create `<domain>/CLAUDE.md` using template from writing-claude-md-files
2. Document purpose, contracts, dependencies, invariants
3. Set freshness date

### Step 5: Commit Documentation Updates

```bash
git add <affected CLAUDE.md files>
git commit -m "docs: update project context for <branch-name>"
```

## Decision Tree

```
Has code changed?
├─ No → Skip (nothing to update)
└─ Yes → What changed?
    ├─ Only tests/internal details → Skip
    └─ Contracts/APIs/structure → Continue
        │
        ├─ New domain created?
        │   └─ Create CLAUDE.md
        │
        ├─ Existing domain changed?
        │   └─ Update domain CLAUDE.md
        │
        └─ Project-wide pattern changed?
            └─ Update root CLAUDE.md
```

## Quick Reference

**Always update when:**
- New public exports added
- Interface signatures changed
- Invariants added/removed
- Dependencies changed
- Architectural decisions made

**Never update for:**
- Internal refactoring
- Bug fixes that don't change contracts
- Test file changes
- Comment/documentation-only changes

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Updating for every change | Only update for contract changes |
| Forgetting freshness date | Always use `date +%Y-%m-%d` |
| Documenting implementation | Document contracts and intent |
| Putting domain info in root | Use domain context files for domain contracts |
| Skipping verification | Read the code, confirm contracts hold |

## Integration Points

**Called by:**
- **project-claude-librarian agent** - Uses this skill to coordinate updates
- **executing-plans** - After all tasks complete
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Before merge/PR
