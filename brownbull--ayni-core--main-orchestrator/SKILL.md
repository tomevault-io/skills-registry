# Main Orchestrator

## Purpose

To decompose high-level requirements into concrete, testable tasks and coordinate execution across domain orchestrators. Maintains epic progress, resolves cross-domain conflicts, and ensures quality gates are met.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Receiving product requirements documents (PRDs)
- User submits feature requests spanning multiple domains
- Need to break down complex workflows into tasks
- Coordinating cross-domain dependencies (frontend + backend + data)
- Epic-level planning and progress tracking is required

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Analyze Requirements

Parse incoming requirements to identify:
- Affected domains (frontend, backend, data, devops)
- Cross-domain dependencies
- Quality standards to apply
- Test requirements for each component

### Step 2: Create Epic Structure

Generate an epic with decomposed tasks:

```yaml
epic:
  id: "epic-{feature-name}"
  priority: "critical|high|medium|low"
  contexts: ["frontend", "backend", "data"]
  tasks:
    - task-001
    - task-002
  dependencies: {}
  success_criteria: "measurable outcomes"
```

### Step 3: Decompose into Tasks

For each task, use this template:

```yaml
task:
  id: "task-{number}-{feature}"
  epic: "parent-epic-id"
  context: "frontend|backend|data|devops"
  when: "Start conditions"
  who: "domain-orchestrator-skill"
  where: "Code locations"
  what: "Feature description"
  how: "standards/standard-name.md"
  goal: "Success criteria"
  check:
    valid: "Happy path scenarios"
    error: "Error handling tests"
    invalid: "Input validation tests"
    edge: "Boundary conditions"
    functional: "Business logic tests"
    visual: "UI tests (if applicable)"
    performance: "Load/speed tests"
    security: "Security validation"
  close: "Final state to record"
```

### Step 4: Assign to Domain Orchestrators

Route tasks to appropriate orchestrators:
- **frontend-orchestrator**: UI/UX, components, state management
- **backend-orchestrator**: APIs, services, business logic
- **data-orchestrator**: ETL, pipelines, feature engineering
- **test-orchestrator**: Test strategy, coverage enforcement
- **devops-orchestrator**: Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployments

### Step 5: Monitor and Coordinate

Track progress by:
- Reading `operations.log` for task completion events
- Updating `ai-state/active/tasks.yaml` with task status
- Resolving cross-domain conflicts
- Triggering human-docs generation on epic completion

## Context Management

### Read From

- **`ai-state/knowledge/patterns.md`** - Proven architectural patterns
- **`ai-state/knowledge/decisions.md`** - Past architecture decisions
- **`operations.log`** - Real-time event stream from all orchestrators
- **`standards/*.md`** - Quality standards to enforce

### Write To

- **`ai-state/active/tasks.yaml`** - Task registry (living document)
- **`operations.log`** - Orchestration events (append-only)
- **`ai-state/knowledge/decisions.md`** - Strategic architectural choices

## Communication Protocol

### Listen for Events

```json
{
  "event": "requirement.new",
  "source": "user|product-manager",
  "content": "requirement description"
}
```

### Broadcast Events

```json
{
  "event": "task.created",
  "orchestrator": "main",
  "task_id": "task-001",
  "assigned_to": "frontend-orchestrator",
  "dependencies": ["task-002"],
  "priority": "high"
}
```

## Decision Criteria

### When to Decompose vs Delegate

**Decompose into multiple tasks when:**
- Feature spans multiple domains (frontend + backend)
- Complex workflow with sequential steps
- Multiple skills need coordination
- Cross-domain dependencies exist

**Delegate directly when:**
- Single-domain feature (only frontend OR backend)
- Isolated component with no dependencies
- Single skill can handle end-to-end

### Priority Assignment

1. **Critical** - Security issues, data loss, breaking changes
2. **High** - User-facing features, API changes, blockers
3. **Medium** - Performance improvements, refactoring
4. **Low** - Documentation, nice-to-have enhancements

## Conflict Resolution

### Backend-Frontend API Misalignment

**Problem:** Frontend needs API that backend hasn't built yet

**Resolution:**
1. Create mock API task for frontend
2. Update backend task with API contract
3. Add dependency: frontend depends on backend completion
4. Log decision in `knowledge/decisions.md`

### Circular Dependencies

**Problem:** Task A needs B, Task B needs A

**Resolution:**
1. Identify shared requirement
2. Extract into new Task C
3. Make A and B both depend on C
4. Re-sequence task order

### Resource Constraints

**Problem:** Multiple critical tasks, limited skill availability

**Resolution:**
1. Serialize tasks by business impact
2. Document delay reasoning in task notes
3. Communicate priority to stakeholders
4. Update timeline estimates

## Success Metrics

Monitor these metrics:
- Task completion rate > 90%
- Cross-context conflicts < 5%
- Epic cycle time within estimates
- Test coverage > 85% per task
- Zero critical issues in production

## Example Usage

### Input: OAuth2 Login Feature

```yaml
requirement: "Add OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub"
```

### Output: Decomposed Epic

```yaml
epic:
  id: "epic-oauth2"
  priority: "high"
  contexts: ["frontend", "backend", "data"]
  tasks:
    - task-001-oauth-ui:
        context: "frontend"
        who: "frontend-orchestrator"
        what: "Add Google and GitHub login buttons"
        how: "standards/frontend-standard.md"
        dependencies: []

    - task-002-oauth-api:
        context: "backend"
        who: "backend-orchestrator"
        what: "Implement OAuth2 flow with provider integration"
        how: "standards/backend-standard.md"
        dependencies: []

    - task-003-oauth-db:
        context: "data"
        who: "data-orchestrator"
        what: "Add OAuth tokens table and user linking"
        how: "standards/data-quality-standard.md"
        dependencies: []

    - task-004-oauth-tests:
        context: "test"
        who: "test-orchestrator"
        what: "E2E tests for OAuth flows"
        how: "standards/testing-requirements.md"
        dependencies: ["task-001", "task-002", "task-003"]
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Creating mega-tasks spanning multiple contexts without decomposition
- Skipping test requirements to "save time"
- Bypassing orchestrators with direct skill invocation
- Ignoring failed tests and proceeding to next task
- Document-first development (write code first, document after)
- Forgetting to log events in operations.log
- Not updating task status in ai-state/active/tasks.yaml

## Integration Points

### With Domain Orchestrators

**frontend-orchestrator:**
- UI/UX components

- Visual testing

**backend-orchestrator:**
- API development
- Business logic
- Service integration

### With Human-Docs Skill

Trigger documentation generation when:

Provide to human-docs:
- Task summaries
- Architecture decisions
- API contract changes
