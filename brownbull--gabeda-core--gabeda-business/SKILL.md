**Reference:** [references/use_cases.md](references/use_cases.md) - 10 detailed use cases (5 current, 5 future)

### 4. Business Requirements
Specify what the system must do from a business perspective.

**Categories:**
- Functional requirements (features and capabilities)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Compliance requirements (data privacy, audit trails)
- Integration requirements (systems to connect)

**Reference:** [references/requirements.md](references/requirements.md) - 15 requirements (FR-01 to FR-10, NFR-01 to NFR-05)

## Target User Profiles

### Geographic Market Focus

**Global + LATAM Specialization:**
- Primary: Global documentation (USD, global business patterns)
- LATAM: Chile as beachhead market (highest GDP per capita, 88% internet penetration)
- Regional Expansion: Chile → Argentina → Colombia → Peru → Mexico (2025-2026)

**Key LATAM Differentiators:**
- Currency volatility (CLP fluctuates 5-15% annually)
- Tax complexity (IVA 19%, SII compliance, Boletas vs Facturas)
- Payment terms (60-90 days standard vs 30 days US)
- Extreme seasonality (December +200%, February -50%)
- Informal economy competition (30-40% commerce informal)

**For Chilean market strategy:** See [references/chile_market_strategy.md](references/chile_market_strategy.md)

**For Chilean market analysis:** See [../../../ai/business/LATAM-Market-Chile.md](../../../ai/business/LATAM-Market-Chile.md)

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Defining Value Proposition

When asked about business value or ROI:

1. **Identify user segment** - Which persona? (Analyst, Operations Manager, Business Owner, etc.)
2. **Reference value props** - See [references/value_propositions.md](references/value_propositions.md)
3. **Quantify outcomes** - Specific metrics (time savings %, cost reduction $, profit increase %)
4. **Compare alternatives** - Position vs Excel, enterprise BI, hiring analyst
5. **Calculate ROI** - Benefits / Costs with timeframe

**Example Output:** "For Operations Managers: 10-15% labor cost reduction through data-driven staffing optimization vs current gut-feel approach. ROI: 285:1 in Chilean retail (see UC-03 Chilean section)."

### Workflow 2: Creating Use Cases

When asked to document how users will interact with features:

1. **Select persona** - Reference [references/personas/](references/personas/)
2. **Define trigger** - What prompts user to perform this task?
3. **Document flow** - Step-by-step user actions
4. **Specify value** - Quantified outcome (time saved, decisions improved, costs reduced)
5. **Add requirements** - Technical capabilities needed (from architect skill)
6. **Consider geography** - LATAM-specific context if applicable

**Template:** See [references/use_cases.md](references/use_cases.md) for structure

### Workflow 3: Competitive Positioning

When asked about competitors or market fit:

1. **Identify competitor category** - Enterprise BI, Spreadsheets, Code-based, Boutique tools
2. **Reference landscape** - See [references/competitive_positioning.md](references/competitive_positioning.md)
3. **Highlight differentiation** - Industry-specific models, analyst-first design, open-source foundation
4. **Position appropriately** - Different market segment (SMB vs Enterprise)
5. **Address objections** - Reference competitive response playbook

**Market Position:** "SMB-focused BI automation - simpler than enterprise BI, more powerful than Excel, cheaper than hiring"

### Workflow 4: Requirements Gathering

When translating business needs to technical specifications:

1. **Start with user story** - "As a [persona], I need to [action] so that [outcome]"
2. **Define acceptance criteria** - What does "done" look like?
3. **Classify requirement** - Functional (FR-XX) or Non-Functional (NFR-XX)
4. **Assign priority** - P0 (must-have), P1 (should-have), P2 (nice-to-have)
5. **Map to roadmap phase** - Phase 1-5 (see [references/roadmap.md](references/roadmap.md))
6. **Validate with architect** - Feasibility and effort estimation

**Reference:** [references/requirements.md](references/requirements.md) - Requirements catalog with priorities

## Examples

### Example 1: Define Value Proposition for Small Business Owner

**Request:** "What's the value proposition for small business owners?"

**Process:**
1. Reference [references/personas/small_business_owner.md](references/personas/small_business_owner.md)
2. Reference [references/value_propositions.md](references/value_propositions.md)
3. Quantify outcomes with specific metrics

**Output:** "For small business owners: Turn transaction data into profit in 1 hour per month. Problem: Too busy to analyze data, can't afford $10K/month consultants. Solution: Automated insights from CSV export. Value: 15-20% profit increase through pricing optimization, 30% reduction in dead stock. Price: $99-199/month (vs $10K consultant). ROI: 250:1 average."

### Example 2: Create Use Case for Pricing Optimization

**Request:** "Document a use case for pricing optimization"

**Process:**
1. Select persona: Small Business Owner
2. Reference [references/use_cases.md](references/use_cases.md) template
3. Document trigger, flow, value
4. Add Chilean context if applicable

**Output:** UC-03 format with user (Small Business Owner), trigger (competitive pressure), 5-step flow, value (15-20% profit increase), and Chilean variant noting currency volatility impact (300:1 ROI).

### Example 3: Competitive Positioning vs Tableau

**Request:** "How do we position against Tableau?"

**Process:**
1. Reference [references/competitive_positioning.md](references/competitive_positioning.md)
2. Identify competitor category: Expensive Enterprise BI
3. Highlight differentiation: Different market segment

**Output:** "Don't compete head-to-head. Tableau targets enterprise data teams ($70-500/user/month, complex setup). GabeDA targets SMB business owners ($99-199/month, turnkey). Differentiation: 10x cheaper, no data warehouse needed, industry-specific models. Positioning: 'Tableau is for enterprises with data teams. GabeDA is for SMBs who need insights, not features.'"
