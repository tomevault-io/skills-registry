[Sampo](https://github.com/bruits/sampo) is a tool to automate changelogs, versioning, and publishing. It uses changesets (markdown files describing changes explicitly) to bump versions (in SemVer format), generate changelogs (human-readable files listing changes), and publish packages (to their respective registries).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-changesets) for changeset redaction guidelines.

## Creating New Changesets

To create a changeset non-interactively:

```sh
sampo add -p <package> -b <bump> -m "<description>"
```

Where `<bump>` is `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. Use `-p` multiple times to target several packages. Prefix with the ecosystem to disambiguate: `-p cargo/my-crate`. When `changesets.tags` is configured, use `-t <tag>` to categorize the changeset.

## Updating Existing Changesets

Pending changesets are stored in the `.sampo/changesets` directory. You can edit these markdown files directly, as long as you follow the guidelines above and Sampo format (read `.sampo/changeset.md.example` for reference).
