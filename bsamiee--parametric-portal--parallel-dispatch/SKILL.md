# [H1][PARALLEL-DISPATCH]
>**Dictum:** *Decomposition into concurrent workstreams multiplies throughput on non-trivial tasks.*

<br>

Orchestrate parallel agents via Task tool.

**Workflow:**
1. §DECISION — Gate: trivial? decomposable? independent?
2. §DECOMPOSITION — Extract facets, map to agents
3. §AGENT_PROMPT — Structure scope, objective, output, context
4. §DISPATCH — Launch ALL agents in ONE message
5. §SYNTHESIS — Integrate convergent, flag divergent

**Exclude:** Trivial requests, sequential dependencies, overlapping writes, <3 streams.

[CRITICAL] Dispatch ALL agents in ONE message. Multiple messages execute sequentially—defeats parallelism.

## [1][DECISION]
>**Dictum:** *Binary gates prevent wasted computation on mismatched patterns.*

<br>

```text
Request received
    ↓
Trivial? (single lookup, direct action)
    ├─ YES → Execute directly
    └─ NO → Decomposable into independent facets?
              ├─ NO → Execute sequentially
              └─ YES → Verify independence → Dispatch parallel
```

[VERIFY] Independence confirmed:
- [ ] Workstreams share no mutable state
- [ ] No stream depends on another's output
- [ ] Results synthesize without conflict

[CRITICAL] Gate failure → sequential execution required.

---
## [2][DECOMPOSITION]
>**Dictum:** *Facet isolation enables contention-free parallel execution.*

<br>

Extract facets via criteria:
- *Independent questions* — Resolve distinct aspects of request
- *Parallel paths* — Accelerate via concurrency
- *Validation layers* — Strengthen confidence through cross-verification
- *Multiple perspectives* — Apply sources independently

**Agent Count:**
- Moderate tasks: 3-5 agents
- Complex tasks: 6-10 agents

[IMPORTANT]:
- [ALWAYS] Map extracted facets to agent assignments.
- [NEVER] Decompose by arbitrary boundaries.
- [NEVER] Create overlapping investigation scope.
- [NEVER] Dispatch single-agent workloads as parallel.

---
## [3][AGENT_PROMPT]
>**Dictum:** *Precise scope prevents overlap and enables conflict-free synthesis.*

<br>

Structure each agent prompt:

```
Scope: [Specific facet—included and excluded elements]
Objective: [Concrete deliverable for this agent]
Output: [Structured format for synthesis]
Context: [Relevant background—agents execute statelessly]
```

[IMPORTANT]:
- [ALWAYS] Define scope boundaries explicitly—agents receive explicit limits only.
- [ALWAYS] Specify output structure for synthesis.
- [ALWAYS] Include sufficient context—no cross-agent communication.
- [NEVER] Reference other agents or outputs.
- [NEVER] Assume shared context between agents.

---
## [4][DISPATCH]
>**Dictum:** *Single-message dispatch prevents sequential bottleneck.*

<br>

[CRITICAL] Dispatch ALL agents in ONE message block. Call multiple Task tools in a single response:

```text
Task(description="Agent A: [scope, objective, output format]", subagent_type="Explore")
Task(description="Agent B: [scope, objective, output format]", subagent_type="Explore")
Task(description="Agent C: [scope, objective, output format]", subagent_type="general-purpose")
```

**Tool Parameters:**

| [INDEX] | [PARAMETER]     | [TYPE] | [REQUIRED] | [DESCRIPTION]                                          |
| :-----: | --------------- | ------ | :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|   [1]   | `description`   | string |    Yes     | Full agent prompt with scope, objective, output format |
|   [2]   | `subagent_type` | string |     No     | `"Explore"` for research; omit for general-purpose     |

**Agent Type Selection:**

| [INDEX] | [TYPE]         | [ACCESS]                   | [USE_WHEN]                                      |
| :-----: | -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
|   [1]   | `"Explore"`    | Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch | Codebase search, file analysis, web research    |
|   [2]   | (omit/default) | All tools                  | General tasks, file creation, code modification |

[IMPORTANT]:
- [ALWAYS] Include complete context per agent — stateless execution.
- [ALWAYS] Use `subagent_type="Explore"` for codebase/research tasks needing Glob, Grep, Read access.
- [ALWAYS] Place ALL Task tool calls in a single response — parallel execution requires single message.
- [NEVER] Chain agent outputs — parallel means independent.
- [NEVER] Use placeholder values — each agent prompt must be self-contained.

---
## [5][SYNTHESIS]
>**Dictum:** *Integration confirms orthogonality and prevents partial results.*

<br>

Synthesize post-dispatch:
- *Convergent findings* → High confidence; integrate directly.
- *Divergent findings* → Flag uncertainty; present alternatives or request resolution.

[CRITICAL] Conflict detected → Decomposition violated orthogonality. Retry sequentially.

[IMPORTANT]:
- [ALWAYS] Verify all agents returned before synthesis.
- [ALWAYS] Flag divergent findings explicitly.

---
## [6][VALIDATION]
>**Dictum:** *Gates prevent incomplete execution.*

<br>

[VERIFY] Completion:
- [ ] Decision: Independence gates passed (no shared state, no dependencies).
- [ ] Decomposition: 3-10 facets mapped to agents.
- [ ] Prompts: Scope, objective, output, context defined per agent.
- [ ] Dispatch: ALL agents sent in ONE message block.
- [ ] Synthesis: Convergent integrated, divergent flagged.
