# Pytest Skill

A comprehensive skill for writing clear, maintainable, and thorough pytest test suites.
This file covers the essentials, and the `references/` directory has deep dives on each
topic.

## Quick reference: where to go deeper

**Bundled scripts** (in `scripts/` — run directly, no need to read them into context):

| Script                 | What it does                                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `find_slow_tests.py`   | Runs pytest, identifies tests exceeding a time threshold |
| `mark_slow_tests.py`   | Adds `@pytest.mark.slow` to the identified slow tests   |

## Core principles

### Every test follows Arrange-Act-Assert

Split each test into three clear phases. The separation makes tests readable at a glance
and keeps each test focused on one behaviour.

```python
def test_cart_applies_discount_for_premium_user(premium_user, empty_cart):
    # Arrange
    empty_cart.add_item(Item(price=100))

    # Act
    total = empty_cart.checkout(premium_user)

    # Assert
    assert total == 90.0  # 10% premium discount
```

Put heavy setup into fixtures so the test body stays short — ideally just the Act and
Assert phases are visible.

### Name tests as sentences

A test name should read like a specification. Someone scanning the test file should
understand *what the system does* without reading the body.

```python
# Good — reads as a behaviour spec
def test_returns_empty_list_when_no_results_match(): ...
def test_raises_value_error_for_negative_quantity(): ...
def test_sends_welcome_email_after_registration(): ...

# Bad — vague, no intent
def test_search(): ...
def test_1(): ...
def test_edge_case(): ...
```

### Use plain assert

pytest rewrites `assert` statements to show rich diffs on failure. There is no need for
`assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, or any other assertion method.

```python
assert result == expected
assert "error" in response.text
assert len(items) == 3
```

For floating-point comparisons, use `pytest.approx()`:

```python
assert calculate_pi() == pytest.approx(3.14159, rel=1e-4)
```

For exceptions, use `pytest.raises`:

```python
with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="must be positive"):
    create_order(quantity=-1)
```

### Fixtures over setup methods

pytest fixtures replace xUnit-style `setUp`/`tearDown`. They are more flexible because
tests declare exactly which fixtures they need, and fixtures compose naturally.

```python
# conftest.py
@pytest.fixture()
def db_connection():
    conn = create_test_db()
    yield conn
    conn.rollback()
    conn.close()

@pytest.fixture()
def user_repo(db_connection):
    return UserRepository(db_connection)

# test_users.py
def test_creates_user(user_repo):
    user = user_repo.create(name="Alice")
    assert user_repo.find_by_id(user.id).name == "Alice"
```

Key rules for fixtures:

- Put shared fixtures in `conftest.py` (per-directory or at the test root).
- Use `function` scope (the default) unless the fixture is expensive and safe to share.
- Use `yield` for setup + teardown in a single function.
- Use `tmp_path` for filesystem operations — never hardcode `/tmp` paths.

For advanced fixture patterns, read [references/fixtures.md](references/fixtures.md) for scopes, autouse, factory
fixtures, and advanced patterns.

### Parametrize to cover multiple inputs

When the same logic applies to several inputs, use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` instead
of writing separate test functions or looping inside a test.

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(("email", "is_valid"), [
    ("alice@example.com", True),
    ("bob.example.com", False),
    ("@nope", False),
    ("a@b.co", True),
])
def test_email_validation(email: str, is_valid: bool) -> None:
    assert validate_email(email) == is_valid
```

Each parameter set runs as a separate test, so failures are pinpointed. For advanced parametrization, read
[references/parametrize-and-markers.md](references/parametrize-and-markers.md) for
advanced parametrization and custom markers.

### Mock at the boundary

When a test needs to isolate from external systems (network, database, filesystem,
clock), mock the outermost I/O call — not internal helpers.

```python
def test_sends_notification_on_order(mocker):
    # Mock the external email service, not internal logic
    mock_send = mocker.patch("myapp.notifications.email_client.send")

    place_order(item="widget", email="alice@example.com")

    mock_send.assert_called_once_with(
        to="alice@example.com",
        subject="Order confirmed",
    )
```

For advanced mocking patterns, read [references/mocking.md](references/mocking.md) for `monkeypatch`, `pytest-mock`,
factory patterns, and when *not* to mock.

### Test isolation is non-negotiable

Every test must pass when run alone and in any order. Common violations:

- Tests that depend on another test creating data first.
- Tests that share a module-level mutable variable.
- Tests that write to a fixed file path without cleanup.

Use fixtures to provide fresh state. Use `tmp_path` for files. Use `monkeypatch.setenv`
for environment variables. Reset any global state in teardown.

## Workflow for writing tests

1. **Identify the behaviour** you want to verify. One test, one behaviour.
2. **Write the test first** (TDD: Red-Green-Refactor).
3. **Run it and confirm it fails** for the right reason.
4. **Write the minimal implementation** to make it pass.
5. **Refactor** both the code and the test for clarity.
6. **Check coverage** — aim for the project threshold (85%).

When adding tests to existing code (not TDD), still follow steps 1 and 5. Focus on
observable behaviour, not implementation details.

## File and directory conventions

```
tests/
    conftest.py              # Root-level shared fixtures
    test_imports.py          # Import smoke tests
    unit/
        conftest.py          # Fixtures for unit tests
        test_core.py         # Tests for src/<pkg>/core.py
        test_cli.py          # Tests for src/<pkg>/cli.py
        common/
            conftest.py      # Fixtures for common module tests
            test_utils.py    # Tests for src/<pkg>/common/utils.py
    integration/
        conftest.py          # Fixtures for integration tests
        test_*.py
    e2e/
        conftest.py          # Fixtures for e2e tests
        test_*.py
```

- File names: `test_<module>.py` — mirrors the source module being tested.
- Function names: `test_<behaviour_description>` — snake_case, descriptive.
- Class names: `TestClassName` — group related tests, no `__init__`.
- Fixture names: descriptive nouns (`db_connection`, `sample_user`, `tmp_config_file`).

Read [references/test-organization.md](references/test-organization.md) for the full
project layout (unit/integration/e2e subdirectories), naming rules, and discovery configuration.

## Running tests

```bash
just test              # all tests, quiet output
just test-parallel     # parallel with pytest-xdist
just coverage          # coverage report with missing lines
just ci                # full pipeline: lint, type-check, test, etc.
```

Useful pytest CLI flags for development:

```bash
pytest -x                    # stop on first failure
pytest --lf                  # rerun only last-failed tests
pytest -k "email"            # run tests matching keyword
pytest -m "not slow"         # skip tests marked @pytest.mark.slow
pytest --durations=10        # show 10 slowest tests
```

---

## Finding and marking slow tests

Long-running tests slow down the feedback loop. The skill bundles two scripts that
work together to find slow tests and add `@pytest.mark.slow` so they can be skipped
during fast development iterations.

### Step 1: Find slow tests

Run the finder script from your project root. It executes pytest with `--durations=0`
and reports every test whose call phase exceeds the threshold (default: 1 second).

```bash
python <skill-path>/scripts/find_slow_tests.py --threshold 1.0
```

Options:

- `--threshold 0.5` — flag tests slower than 500ms.
- `--top 10` — only show the 10 slowest.
- `--test-path tests/integration/` — limit to a specific directory.
- `--json-only` — machine-readable JSON on stdout only.

The output is a JSON array on stdout (for piping) plus a human summary on stderr.
Both scripts use the standard library `logging` module (stderr for messages; a dedicated
stdout logger for JSON) instead of `print` or raw `sys.stdout`/`sys.stderr` writes.

### Step 2: Mark them

Pipe the output directly into the marker script:

```bash
python <skill-path>/scripts/find_slow_tests.py --threshold 1.0 \
  | python <skill-path>/scripts/mark_slow_tests.py
```

This adds `@pytest.mark.slow` above each slow test function and inserts
`import pytest` if the file does not already have it. Tests that already carry
the marker are skipped.

Use `--dry-run` to preview changes without modifying files:

```bash
python <skill-path>/scripts/find_slow_tests.py --threshold 1.0 \
  | python <skill-path>/scripts/mark_slow_tests.py --dry-run
```

### Step 3: Run fast tests only

Once slow tests are marked, skip them during normal development:

```bash
pytest -m "not slow"
```

Run the full suite (including slow tests) before opening a PR or in CI.

### When to use this

- After adding integration or E2E tests that touch real databases, networks, or
  large datasets.
- When `pytest --durations=10` shows tests taking more than a second.
- During CI optimisation — split fast and slow test runs into separate jobs.

Read [references/parametrize-and-markers.md](references/parametrize-and-markers.md)
for more on custom markers and [references/ci-and-plugins.md](references/ci-and-plugins.md)
for CI integration patterns.

## Efficiency: batch edits and parallel calls

- **Batch edits:** When adding multiple test functions to the same file, write
  them all in a single Edit tool call rather than one function at a time.
- **Parallel calls:** When running `just test` and `just coverage` independently,
  make both calls in a single message.
- **Read before edit:** Read the target test file and the source module once each,
  plan all test functions, then write them in one Edit call.
