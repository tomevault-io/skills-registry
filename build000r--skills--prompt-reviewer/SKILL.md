# Prompt Reviewer

Evaluate user prompting quality across AI coding tools. Supports Claude Code, Codex, AMP, OpenCode, and any other tool.

## Use This For

- Scoring prompt quality for the current conversation or extracted session history
- Reviewing trends, progress, backfills, and prompt-improvement opportunities
- Answering "how am I doing as a prompter?" with a structured rubric

## Do Not Use This For

- Code review, product review, or skill-workflow review
- Generic conversation critique without wanting prompt-quality scoring
- Historical extraction work when the user only wants a quick current-session read

## Modes

Modes customize scoring and review behavior for specific teams or projects — axis weights, review cadence, output format preferences, and team context that affects expectations. Stored in `modes/` (gitignored, never committed).

### How Modes Work

Team-specific configuration (scoring weight adjustments, review cadence, custom session source paths, output format preferences) lives in the client overlay: `skillbox-config/clients/{client}/overlay.yaml` → auto-generated `context.yaml`.

### Client Config Resolution (Step 0)

1. Look for `context.yaml` in the working tree (generated from the client overlay)
2. If found, load team-specific settings (scoring weights, review cadence, etc.) from it automatically
3. If not found, ask the user which client to target (or use default scoring)
4. If no `skillbox-config/` exists, use standard scoring with no adjustments

## Workflow Overview

**Review flow** (default):
1. Gather parameters (time range, provider, scope)
2. Extract sessions (script for Claude/Codex, manual for others)
3. Score prompts (9 axes, 23 points)
4. Output quick summary (default) → offer full scorecard
5. Save scores to history (with provider/model metadata)
6. Show trend if history exists

**Trend-only flow** (when user asks for "trend", "progress", "history"):
1. Run show_trend.py and display results (optionally filter by provider)
2. Skip review steps

**Backfill flow** (when user asks to "backfill", "backfill next", "list weeks", "catch up"):
1. Run `list_weeks.py` to see available weeks and backfill status
2. If user said "backfill next [provider]" → immediately run the full review for that provider's next unreviewed week (no need to ask)
3. If user just said "list weeks" → show the table and stop
4. After review, ask about purging, then offer to continue with next week

## Step 1: Gather Parameters

Ask the user with AskUserQuestion:

**Provider** (determines extraction method)
- Claude Code (auto-extract from ~/.claude sessions)
- Codex (auto-extract from ~/.codex sessions)
- OpenCode (auto-extract from ~/.local/state/opencode — single batch, no timestamps)
- AMP (manual — score current/pasted conversation)
- Other (manual)

**Time range** (default: today, for auto-extract providers only)
- Today (recommended)
- Past week
- Past month
- All time

**Source** (when provider is auto-extractable)
- All three (Claude Code + Codex + OpenCode)
- Both Claude Code and Codex (recommended)
- Claude Code only
- Codex only
- OpenCode only

**Model** (optional, for trend metadata)
- Ask what model they were using, or infer from context
- Examples: opus, sonnet, gpt-4o, o3, gemini-2.5-pro

**Scope** (Claude Code only)
- Current project only
- All projects

## Step 2: Extract Sessions

**For Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode** (auto-extract):

```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/extract_sessions.py \
  --source {claude|codex|opencode|both|all} \
  --since {date} \
  --project {project_path_if_filtered} \
  --limit 20
```

Source options: `both` = claude + codex, `all` = claude + codex + opencode

**OpenCode limitation:** OpenCode stores prompts without timestamps or session boundaries.
All prompts are returned as a single batch using the file's mtime for date filtering.
Backfill-by-week is not meaningful for OpenCode.

**For AMP / Other** (manual):

No extraction script needed. Instead:
1. Ask the user to paste conversation excerpts, share a session file, or point to a log
2. If the user says "review this session" or "review my last conversation", score the prompts visible in the current conversation context
3. Score whatever user prompts are available — the rubric works the same regardless of source

## Step 3: Score Prompts

Read `references/scoring-rubric.md` for detailed criteria.

Score each session on 9 axes:

| Axis | Max | What to look for |
|------|-----|------------------|
| Clarity | 3 | Named files, explicit goals, validation steps |
| Context & Inputs | 3 | Pasted errors, file paths, reproduction steps |
| Autonomy & Scope | 2 | "Only touch X", "Don't modify Y", stop conditions |
| Constraint Handling | 2 | "Run tests first", "Ask before deploying" |
| Iterative Checkpoints | 2 | "Pause after X", "Show me before continuing" |
| Follow-up Efficiency | 3 | New context vs bare "continue" or "yes" |
| Collaboration Traits | 3 | Constructive feedback, respectful redirects |
| Adaptability | 2 | Pivots based on discoveries |
| Outcome Alignment | 3 | Clear conclusion, explicit handoff |

**Composite = sum(scores) / 23**

## Step 4: Output

**Quick summary first** → then offer full scorecard.

### Quick Summary Template (default)

```
## Prompt Review - Quick Score

**Composite: X.XX / 1.00**
Sessions: N | Prompts: M

### Top 3 Improvements

1. **[Axis]** (X/max): [Coaching tip]
   > Example: "[quoted prompt]"
   > Try instead: "[improved version]"

2. ...

3. ...

### What's Working Well
- **[Axis]** (X/max): [Positive observation]
```

### Full Scorecard Template (on request)

```
## Prompt Review - Full Scorecard

**Composite: X.XX / 1.00**
Sessions: N | Prompts: M | Source: Claude/Codex/Both

### Axis Breakdown

| Axis | Score | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| Clarity | X/3 | "[quoted prompt]" |
| Context & Inputs | X/3 | "[quoted prompt]" |
| Autonomy & Scope | X/2 | "[quoted prompt]" |
| Constraint Handling | X/2 | "[quoted prompt]" |
| Iterative Checkpoints | X/2 | "[quoted prompt]" |
| Follow-up Efficiency | X/3 | "[quoted prompt]" |
| Collaboration Traits | X/3 | "[quoted prompt]" |
| Adaptability | X/2 | "[quoted prompt]" |
| Outcome Alignment | X/3 | "[quoted prompt]" |

### Superlatives

- **Prompt MVP**: "[best prompt]" - [why it worked]
- **Best Save**: "[course correction]" - [what it prevented]
- **Facepalm**: "[worst follow-up]" - [what to do instead]
- **Lowest Hanging Fruit**: [easiest fix with biggest impact]

### Coaching Plan

1. **[Priority improvement]**
   > Before: "[current pattern]"
   > After: "[improved pattern]"

2. ...
```

## Step 5: Save Scores to History

After outputting the review, persist scores AND qualitative insights:

```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/save_review.py \
  --composite {composite} --sessions {N} --prompts {M} \
  --clarity {score} --context {score} --autonomy {score} \
  --constraints {score} --checkpoints {score} --followup {score} \
  --collaboration {score} --adaptability {score} --outcome {score} \
  --source {source} --provider {provider} [--model {model}] [--project {path}] \
  [--week YYYY-WNN] \
  --improvements '[{"axis":"...","score":X.X,"tip":"...","example":"..."},...]' \
  --strengths '[{"axis":"...","score":X.X,"observation":"..."},...]'
```

**Improvements** (Top 3): Each entry has `axis`, `score`, `tip` (coaching advice), `example` (quoted prompt).

**Strengths** (What's Working Well): Each entry has `axis`, `score`, `observation`.

**--week** (for backfills): Override the week recorded. Without this, saves use today's week.

Always run this after scoring. Scores accumulate in `~/.claude/prompt-review-history.jsonl`.

Provider values: `claude`, `codex`, `amp`, `opencode`, `other`

## Step 6: Show Trend

After saving, if history has 2+ reviews, show the trend:

```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/show_trend.py --weeks 8
```

Filter to a single provider:

```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/show_trend.py --weeks 8 --provider codex
```

CSV export (for spreadsheet charting):

```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/show_trend.py --csv --weeks 12
```

### Trend Output Template

```
## Prompt Score Trend (2025-W01 to 2025-W04)

**Composite:** 0.78 (+0.09) ▃▄▅▆

| Week | Composite | Sessions | Prompts | Trend |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|-------|
| 2025-W01 | 0.69 | 8 | 42 |   -- |
| 2025-W02 | 0.72 | 6 | 35 | +0.03 |
| 2025-W03 | 0.74 | 10 | 51 | +0.02 |
| 2025-W04 | 0.78 | 7 | 38 | +0.04 |

### Per-Axis Trends

| Axis | Max | Current | Trend | Spark |
|------|-----|---------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 3 | 2.5 | +0.3 | ▄▅▅▆ |
| Context | 3 | 2.0 | +0.2 | ▃▃▄▅ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Movers

- **Most improved:** Clarity (+0.3/3)
- **Needs attention:** Constraints (-0.2/2)

### By Provider

| Provider | Reviews | Avg Score | Spark |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| claude   | 12      | 0.76      | ▅▅▆▆ |
| codex    | 5       | 0.68      | ▄▅▅   |
| amp      | 3       | 0.72      | ▅▅▆   |
```

The "By Provider" section appears automatically when history contains multiple providers.

## Backfill Workflow

To build trend history from past sessions, use the backfill flow.

### Quick Backfill (recommended)

When user says **"backfill next codex"** or **"backfill next claude"**:

1. Run `list_weeks.py` to find the next unreviewed week for that provider
2. Immediately run extract_sessions.py for that week
3. Score all prompts, output review, save with `--week` override
4. Ask about purging
5. Offer: "Continue with next week?"

No questions needed — just do the next week.

### Manual Backfill

If user wants to see status first or pick a specific week:

#### Step 1: List Available Weeks

```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/list_weeks.py
```

Or get the full backfill prompt directly:

```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/list_weeks.py --provider codex --prompt
```

Output shows all weeks with session data, which providers have data, and which have been reviewed:

```
## Session Weeks Available

| Week | Claude | Codex | OpenCode | Reviewed |
|------|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| 2025-W36 | — | 10 | — | — |
| 2025-W37 | — | 173 | — | — |
| 2025-W38 | — | 131 | — | codex |
| 2026-W05 | 656 | 3 | — | claude, codex |

### Next to Backfill

- **codex**: 2025-W36 (10 sessions)

### Backfill Command

python3 ~/.claude/skills/prompt-reviewer/scripts/extract_sessions.py \
  --source codex \
  --since 2025-09-01 \
  --until 2025-09-07 \
  --limit 100
```

### Step 2: Review the Week

Run the suggested extract command, then score ALL prompts (not a sample). Use the standard review flow:

1. Extract sessions for the week
2. Score every user prompt on all 9 axes
3. Output the review with week label (e.g., "2025-W36 Backfill")
4. Save scores with `save_review.py`

### Step 3: Repeat

Run `list_weeks.py` again to see updated status and get the next week to review.

### Backfill Prompt Template

For handing off a single week to another agent:

```
You are doing a prompt quality backfill review for week {WEEK} ({PROVIDER} sessions).

## Step 1: Extract sessions

Run:
python3 ~/.claude/skills/prompt-reviewer/scripts/extract_sessions.py \
  --source {provider} \
  --since {start_date} \
  --until {end_date} \
  --limit 100

## Step 2: Score all user prompts

Read ~/.claude/skills/prompt-reviewer/references/scoring-rubric.md.

Score EVERY user prompt (not a sample) on all 9 axes. Compute averages.
Composite = sum(axis averages) / 23

## Step 3: Output the review

## Prompt Review - {WEEK} ({PROVIDER} Backfill)

**Composite: X.XX / 1.00**
Sessions: N | Prompts: M | Provider: {provider}

### Top 3 Improvements
1. **[Axis]** (X.X/max): [Coaching tip]
   > Example: "[quoted prompt]"
2. ...
3. ...

### What's Working Well
- **[Axis]** (X.X/max): [Positive observation]

## Step 4: Save scores (include qualitative insights!)

python3 ~/.claude/skills/prompt-reviewer/scripts/save_review.py \
  --composite {composite} --sessions {N} --prompts {M} \
  --clarity {avg} --context {avg} --autonomy {avg} \
  --constraints {avg} --checkpoints {avg} --followup {avg} \
  --collaboration {avg} --adaptability {avg} --outcome {avg} \
  --source {provider} --provider {provider} --week {WEEK} \
  --improvements '[{"axis":"...","score":X.X,"tip":"...","example":"..."},...]' \
  --strengths '[{"axis":"...","score":X.X,"observation":"..."},...]'

IMPORTANT: Use --week {WEEK} to record the original week, not today's date.

## Step 5: Ask about purging old sessions (optional)

After saving, ask the user if they want to delete the reviewed session files to free disk space.

First preview (always use --dry-run first):
```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/purge_sessions.py \
  --provider {provider} --week {WEEK} --dry-run
```

If user confirms, run without --dry-run:
```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/purge_sessions.py \
  --provider {provider} --week {WEEK}
```

NEVER delete without asking first.
```

## Scoring Examples

### Clarity

**3/3** - Goal + file + validation:
> "Open `src/auth/login.ts`, confirm the OAuth callback matches the README spec, and stop before making changes."

**1/3** - Vague request:
> "make the transition look better"

**0/3** - No actionable request:
> "continue"

**Coaching**: Instead of "make it better", try "fade the transition over 0.5s with ease-out, and show me before applying"

### Context & Inputs

**3/3** - Error + file + steps:
> "Getting `TypeError: undefined is not a function` at line 42 of `utils.ts` when I run `npm test`. Here's the failing test output: [pasted]"

**1/3** - Missing details:
> "there's a bug in the auth flow"

**Coaching**: Paste the error message, specify which file, include reproduction steps

### Follow-up Efficiency

**3/3** - Adds new context:
> "Good, but the animation is too fast. Slow it to 300ms and add a subtle bounce at the end."

**0/3** - Filler:
> "yes"

**Coaching**: Instead of bare "yes", try "yes, and also check that it works on mobile"

## Scoring Philosophy

**Be constructive, not punitive.** The goal is improvement.

- Quote specific prompts as evidence
- Highlight what's working, not just problems
- Make coaching actionable ("Instead of X, try Y")
- Acknowledge context (quick questions don't need full briefs)
