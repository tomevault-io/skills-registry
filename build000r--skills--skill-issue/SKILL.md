# Skill Creator

Create effective skills for AI coding agents: modular packages that extend agents with specialized workflows, domain expertise, and reusable tools.

## First Progress Marker (Required)

Start the first progress update with the exact prefix `Using skill-issue`.

Preferred format: `Using skill-issue to <goal>. First I will <next concrete step>.`

Do not change or omit that prefix. Reliability review tooling treats it as a stable invocation marker.

## Use This For

- Creating, updating, packaging, or reviewing reusable agent skills
- Transcript-driven skill reliability work based on real invocation history
- Working on SKILL.md files, bundled scripts/references/assets, or skill packaging

## Do Not Use This For

- One-off prompts or workflows that are not meant to become reusable skills
- Generic repo maintenance with no skill artifact involved
- Pure prompt review when the target is the user rather than the skill contract

## Client Overlays

Client overlays customize skill creation for specific organizations or projects — naming conventions, required sections, publishing targets, testing workflows, and review processes. Managed through the skillbox client overlay system.

### How Client Overlays Work

Each client overlay lives in `skillbox-config/clients/{client}/overlay.yaml`. It contains org-specific configuration: skill naming patterns, required SKILL.md sections, publishing target (marketplace, GitHub org, internal registry), validation commands, standard bundled resources, and the review/approval workflow.

### Overlay Selection (Step 0)

1. Check `skillbox-config/clients/` for available client overlays
2. Each overlay has a `cwd_match` field — a path prefix to match against cwd
3. If cwd matches exactly one overlay, use it automatically
4. If cwd matches multiple, ask the user which overlay to use
5. **If no overlay matches or none exist, ask before creating one.** Default to read-only diagnostics (`list`, `match`, `validate`) until the user confirms creation. Do not fall back to generic defaults.

### Overlay Miss → Create Flow

When no overlay matches the current working directory:

1. Tell the user: no matching client overlay found for `{cwd}` and ask whether to create one now
2. If the user approves, infer a `CLIENT_ID` from the cwd (repo name, project name, or ask)
3. Run the skillbox-quickstart scan + generate flow to create the overlay:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/skillbox-quickstart/scripts/scan_environment.py --json > /tmp/skillbox-scan.json
cat /tmp/skillbox-scan.json | python3 ~/.claude/skills/skillbox-quickstart/scripts/generate_overlay.py \
  --client-id {CLIENT_ID} --json > /tmp/skillbox-recommendation.json
```

4. Review the generated overlay with the user, then install it:

```bash
mkdir -p skillbox-config/clients/{CLIENT_ID}
cp /tmp/overlay.yaml skillbox-config/clients/{CLIENT_ID}/overlay.yaml
```

5. Re-run Step 0 — the new overlay should now match

If the user does not approve creation, keep the run read-only and report that overlay-backed execution is blocked until creation is authorized.

This keeps every skill invocation overlay-backed. Generic/manual fallbacks mask configuration gaps that compound across sessions.

Client overlays are managed outside the skill repo — they contain org-specific paths and workflows that should not be committed to public skill files.

## Overlay Mode

Use this mode when the user wants to manage client overlays directly: "create an overlay", "list overlays", "check my overlays", "which overlay matches", "migrate overlays", or when another skill delegates overlay creation on a miss.

### Mode Detection

| User Says / Context | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| "create an overlay", "add a client" | `create` |
| "list overlays", "show clients" | `list` |
| "check overlays", "validate overlays" | `validate` |
| "which overlay matches", "what client am I" | `match` |
| "migrate overlays", "update overlay format" | `migrate` |
| Another skill hits an overlay miss | `create` (ask-first; no auto-write) |

### Actions

#### create

Create a new client overlay. Two paths depending on context:

Before running either create path, ask for explicit confirmation to write `skillbox-config/clients/{CLIENT_ID}/overlay.yaml`.

**Quick create** (minimal — when the miss is blocking another skill):

```bash
scripts/manage_overlays.py create --client-id {CLIENT_ID} --cwd {CWD} --json
```

This writes a minimal `overlay.yaml` with just the `cwd_match` set. Enough to unblock the calling skill. Enrich later.

**Full create** (scan-backed — when the user explicitly asks to set up an overlay):

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/skillbox-quickstart/scripts/scan_environment.py --json > /tmp/skillbox-scan.json
cat /tmp/skillbox-scan.json | python3 ~/.claude/skills/skillbox-quickstart/scripts/generate_overlay.py \
  --client-id {CLIENT_ID} --output /tmp/overlay-draft
```

Review the draft with the user, then install:

```bash
mkdir -p skillbox-config/clients/{CLIENT_ID}
cp /tmp/overlay-draft/overlay.yaml skillbox-config/clients/{CLIENT_ID}/overlay.yaml
```

After either path, verify:

```bash
scripts/manage_overlays.py match --cwd {CWD} --json
```

#### list

```bash
scripts/manage_overlays.py list --json
```

Shows all overlays, their `cwd_match` patterns, repo count, and version.

#### validate

```bash
scripts/manage_overlays.py validate --json
```

Checks structure, required fields, and path existence. Reports errors and warnings per overlay.

#### match

```bash
scripts/manage_overlays.py match --cwd {CWD} --json
```

Returns which overlay(s) match a given working directory. Exit 0 = match found, exit 1 = no match.

#### migrate

```bash
scripts/manage_overlays.py migrate --to-version {N} --json
```

Reports which overlays need migration. Does not auto-migrate — presents the list for the agent to handle per-overlay.

### Sibling Skill Delegation

When any skill hits an overlay miss, it should delegate to skill-issue's overlay mode rather than implementing its own creation flow. The contract:

1. Skill detects no overlay matches cwd
2. Skill tells the user: "No matching client overlay for `{cwd}`. Do you want me to create one?"
3. If the user confirms, skill runs the quick create path (or invokes skill-issue if available)
4. If the user does not confirm, skill stays in read-only mode and reports the block
5. If created, skill re-runs overlay selection — should now match

Skills that already stop on miss (deploy, ssh-info, dev-sanity) should add this ask-first create step before stopping.

## Core Principles

### Concise is Key

The context window is a public good. Only add context the agent doesn't already have. Challenge each piece: "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match specificity to the task's fragility:

- **High freedom (text instructions)**: Multiple valid approaches, context-dependent decisions
- **Medium freedom (pseudocode/parameterized scripts)**: Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable
- **Low freedom (specific scripts)**: Fragile operations, consistency critical, exact sequence required

### Skill Structure

Every skill has a required `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter + markdown body) and optional bundled resources (`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`).

For directory structure details, resource types, progressive disclosure patterns, and what NOT to include, see [references/skill-structure.md](references/skill-structure.md).

### Cross-Skill Contract Drift

When a platform or package contract changes, do not stop at the first `SKILL.md` you touch. Check for sibling skills that encode the old contract in:

- scanner scripts
- rubrics
- output templates
- examples and canned commands
- reference files that summarize package behavior

If the changed skill is part of a larger ecosystem, update the dependent skills in the same batch or call out the drift explicitly. Treat those files as one artifact, not separate chores.

## Skill Creation Process

1. Understand the skill with concrete examples
2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)
3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)
4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)
5. Validate and package the skill (run package_skill.py)
6. Iterate based on real usage
7. Publish to marketplaces (optional) — see `references/publishing.md`

Follow these steps in order, skipping only if clearly not applicable.

## Reliability Review Mode

Use this mode when the user wants to improve a skill from real transcript evidence instead of intuition: "review this skill", "how is this skill doing", "when did we last use this skill", "look at past invocations", or "reduce unnecessary checkpoints."

This mode reads Claude/Codex JSONL logs directly, writes a lightweight last-seen marker, builds operator evidence packets from repeated transcript failures, and saves review snapshots for trend reporting.

Treat real user-triggered skill invocations as the experiment corpus. Do not fabricate synthetic reruns by default. Patch from live traces, ship once, then watch the next real invocation window.

### Review Flow

1. Scan transcript history for a target skill:

```bash
scripts/review_skill_usage.py --skill skill-issue --source both --limit 50 > /tmp/skill-issue-review.json
```

By default, this resumes from `~/.claude/skill-markers/<skill>.json` using the previous review's `reviewed_until` timestamp. On the first run for a skill, it falls back to `--since month`. Pass an explicit `--since ...` to override, or `--since marker` to force marker-resume behavior.

This writes `~/.claude/skill-markers/<skill>.json` by default with the latest detected invocation date plus the review window cursor. Use `--no-marker` only when you explicitly need read-only behavior.

Optional, when you need deterministic raw tool tallies for evals, count the underlying tool calls directly:

```bash
scripts/count_tool_invocations.py --skill skill-issue --source both --since month
scripts/count_tool_invocations.py --source both --since week
```

This counts raw Codex `function_call` entries and Claude `tool_use` blocks, sorted by count then tool name.

1b. **Mine cross-session patterns via cass** (complements the transcript scan above):

Use the `cass` skill to search across all indexed sessions for the target skill's invocation patterns, corrections, and usage evolution. This surfaces signal the single-transcript scanner misses — especially ritual detection, cross-project usage, and prompt drift.

```bash
# Ensure cass index is fresh
cass status --json && cass index --json

# Find all sessions mentioning this skill (lexical, minimal output)
cass search "SKILL_NAME" --json --fields minimal --limit 50

# Filter to user prompts (lines 1-3) for invocation pattern analysis
cass search "SKILL_NAME" --json --fields minimal --limit 50 \
  | jq '[.hits[] | select(.line_number <= 3)]'

# Detect rituals: prompts repeated 10+ times = working methodology
cass search "SKILL_NAME" --json --fields minimal --limit 100 \
  | jq '[.hits[] | select(.line_number <= 3) | .title[0:80]] | group_by(.) | map({prompt: .[0], count: length}) | sort_by(-.count) | .[0:10]'

# Find correction signals near skill invocations
cass search "SKILL_NAME" --json --fields minimal --limit 50 \
  | jq '[.hits[] | select(.line_number > 3 and .line_number < 20)]' \
  # Then cass view hits with corrections ("no", "not that", "stop", "wrong")
```

**What to extract from cass results:**
- **Ritual count** (>10 = working pattern): If users repeat the same prompt shape to invoke this skill, that's the real trigger — compare it against the skill's `description` field. Mismatch = discoverability gap.
- **Prompt drift**: If the same user rephrases their invocation across sessions, the skill's trigger conditions or docs may be unclear. Feed into `contract-clarity` evidence packets.
- **Cross-project spread**: Use `--aggregate workspace` to see which projects use this skill. Single-project usage may indicate the skill is too specialized for its current generality level.
- **Correction clusters**: Sessions where user prompts after invocation contain corrections feed directly into `correction_rate` and `contract-clarity` packet families.

If cass index is unhealthy or unavailable, note it and proceed with transcript-only data. Do not block the review on cass availability.

2. Read the generated JSON and focus on reliability signals:
- `ack_rate`: how often the run included an explicit `Using <skill>` marker
- `validation_rate`: how often the run executed a concrete verification command
- `checkpoint_rate`: how often the agent asked for confirmation/checkpoint prompts
- `risk_gating_rate`: how often users explicitly signaled that the run should have paused for clarification, approval, or outside review before a risky step
- `correction_rate`: how often the user redirected the run after it started
- `completion_rate`: how often the transcript reached a clear completion event

3. Build operator evidence packets before patching the skill:

```bash
scripts/generate_skill_evidence_packets.py --input /tmp/skill-issue-review.json --json > /tmp/skill-issue-packets.json
```

This turns repeated transcript failures into packetized review artifacts with:
- a failure family (`verification-gap`, `contract-clarity`, `checkpoint-defaults`, etc.)
- an expected contract
- representative traces
- a historical reference slice with holdout examples
- target files and a watch metric
- a post-ship observation window for future real invocations

Read [references/operator-evidence-loop.md](references/operator-evidence-loop.md) for the packet structure and graduation rules.

4. Use one packet to drive the next change instead of editing from vibes:
- Low `ack_rate` / `observability-gap`: require a stable first commentary marker so invocation discovery does not depend on path heuristics
- Low `validation_rate` / `verification-gap`: add or tighten the required verification block in the skill
- High `checkpoint_rate` / `checkpoint-defaults`: move repeated preferences into client overlays or default rules so humans are only asked when information is missing or risky
- High `risk_gating_rate` / `risk-gating-gap`: add explicit pause points for irreversible or high-risk branches so the skill asks first or routes to the right reviewer before proceeding
- High `correction_rate` / `contract-clarity`: tighten trigger language, non-goals, or ask-cascade guidance
- Repeated raw shell stems (`rg`, `sed`, `find`, etc.) / `automation-gap`: bundle scripts/references instead of relying on freehand shell work

5. If you ship a packet-driven change, ask before writing to the packet ledger. If approved, log the shipment and expected watch window:

```bash
scripts/log_skill_packet_decision.py \
  --input /tmp/skill-issue-packets.json \
  --packet-id verification-gap-global \
  --review /tmp/skill-issue-review.json \
  --notes "tightened verification block in closeout"
```

This appends to `~/.claude/skill-packet-ledger.jsonl` with the packet id, expected contract,
watch metric baseline, and the next live observation window. The ledger is for shipped changes
against real traffic, not synthetic replay runs.

### Required Verification (Packet-Driven Updates)

Before handing back a packet-driven SKILL.md update, run all required checks:

1. Validate the edited skill:

```bash
scripts/quick_validate.py <path/to/skill-folder>
```

2. Regenerate evidence packets from the current review input and confirm packet generation still succeeds:

```bash
scripts/generate_skill_evidence_packets.py --input /tmp/<skill>-review.json --json > /tmp/<skill>-packets.verify.json
```

3. If ledger logging was explicitly approved, verify the packet id in `~/.claude/skill-packet-ledger.jsonl` matches the shipped change; otherwise state that logging was intentionally skipped.

Do not hand the run back until these checks are complete and passing.

6. Save the review for trend tracking:

```bash
scripts/save_skill_review.py --input /tmp/skill-issue-review.json
```

This appends to `~/.claude/skill-review-history.jsonl`.

7. Show the trend when history exists:

```bash
scripts/show_skill_trend.py --skill skill-issue --weeks 8
```

8. Mine deterministic opportunity cards from the post-invocation review:

```bash
scripts/generate_skill_opportunities.py --input /tmp/skill-issue-review.json
```

This ranks concrete improvement ideas such as verification gaps, over-checkpointing,
missing risk gates, contract-clarity problems, and automation gaps so `skill-issue`
can iterate on the highest-leverage changes first.

9. When the question is portfolio-level rather than "improve this one skill", run the catalog-wide miner:

```bash
scripts/generate_skill_portfolio_opportunities.py --source both --since month
```

Use this when you want to find:
- repeated manual workflows that should become new skills
- requests that look like an existing skill but are not activating it reliably
- overlapping skills that should likely collapse into one canonical skill plus client overlays or aliases

This is a cross-skill scan. It reads all top-level skills in the current skills root and all matching
Claude/Codex sessions in range, then ranks `skill-creation-opportunity`,
`skill-discoverability-gap`, and `skill-consolidation-opportunity` cards.

10. After enough new real invocations arrive, rerun the review and compare the watch metric to the
logged baseline:

- Prefer the next 5-20 real invocations of that skill, or a 1-2 week window for lower-volume skills
- Judge success from live post-ship behavior, not from synthetic reruns of canned prompts
- Only reach for fuller evals when the contract and historical reference slice have stabilized

Do not jump straight from aggregate rates to a patch. Build or read one operator evidence packet first, and do not treat synthetic reruns as the default source of truth.

### Evidence Rules

- Prefer `assistant_ack` and `skill_path` as strong invocation evidence.
- Treat raw user mentions as weak evidence unless paired with a path touch or explicit ack marker.
- If the review finds no Claude Code matches, say so clearly instead of implying cross-provider coverage.
- Optimize suggestions for one goal: remove human checkpoints except where human input is genuinely required.
- Treat interruption-like cues as weak evidence by themselves; prefer explicit user language like "wait", "ask first", "before sending", or "bring X in the loop" before labeling a missing risk gate.
- Prefer repeated trace clusters over a single memorable anecdote when deciding what to patch next.
- Treat evidence packets as the default bridge from review metrics to concrete edits; use full eval suites only when the contract and historical reference slice have stabilized.

### Step 1: Understand the Skill

Skip only when usage patterns are already clearly understood.

Gather concrete examples of how the skill will be used — from the user or by generating examples and validating with feedback. Ask about functionality scope, usage examples, and trigger phrases. Don't overwhelm with questions; start with the most important and follow up.

### Step 2: Plan Reusable Contents

**Choose a searchable name first.** Two searchable keywords, `[domain]-[action]` pattern, lowercase with hyphens. Test: "What would someone search for?" See `references/publishing.md` for detailed naming guidance.

Then analyze each example: consider how to execute from scratch, and identify what scripts, references, and assets would help when repeating these workflows.

Example: A `pdf-editor` skill for "Help me rotate this PDF" — rotating requires the same code each time → include `scripts/rotate_pdf.py`.

### Step 3: Initialize the Skill

Skip if the skill already exists and only needs iteration or packaging.

```bash
scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--minimal]
```

Creates a template skill directory with SKILL.md, example `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`. Use `--minimal` when you already know what you're building. Customize or remove generated example files as needed.

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

The skill is for another agent instance. Include non-obvious procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, and reusable assets.

#### Consult Design Pattern Guides

- **Multi-step processes**: Read references/workflows.md
- **Consistent output formats**: Read references/output-patterns.md
- **Complete example**: Read references/example-minimal-skill.md
- **Publishing**: Read references/publishing.md

#### Sprite Variant Contract (Character Diversity + Compatibility)

When creating or updating sprite-generation skills, enforce this contract:

- Keep runtime naming/API contract fixed:
  - Files: `active.svg`, `drowsy.svg`, `sleeping.svg`, `deep_sleep.svg`
  - Field names: `active`, `drowsy`, `sleeping`, `deep_sleep`
- Keep directory convention fixed for the target runtime (project local): `.sprite-runtime/sprites/`
- Preserve state semantics:
  - `active`: awake/engaged
  - `drowsy`: transitional low-energy
  - `sleeping`: asleep
  - `deep_sleep`: deepest rest state
- Encourage visual diversity per repo/domain:
  - Distinct palettes tied to repo branding
  - Distinct silhouettes/accessories/motifs (not only recolors)
  - Keep readability at small sizes
  - If sibling repos share a base character, include a structural identity marker group (`<g id="backend-id">` / `<g id="frontend-id">`) in every state, not just palette shifts
- Make sprite SVGs self-contained when using logo/image wrappers:
  - Avoid external image refs like `<image href=\"/logo.png\">` or `./logo.png`
  - Prefer embedded data URIs so assets render when injected cross-origin/cross-app
- Do not break loaders to achieve style changes. Creativity is applied inside the fixed naming + state contract.

Quick validation before shipping:
```bash
for s in active drowsy sleeping deep_sleep; do
  test -f ".sprite-runtime/sprites/${s}.svg" || echo "missing ${s}.svg"
done

# Should output nothing for self-contained SVG packs
rg -n '<image[^>]+href="/' .sprite-runtime/sprites
rg -n '<image[^>]+href="./' .sprite-runtime/sprites

# Optional but required when differentiating sibling repos (for example frontend vs backend)
MARKER_ID="backend-id"
for s in active drowsy sleeping deep_sleep; do
  rg -q "<g id=\"${MARKER_ID}\"" ".sprite-runtime/sprites/${s}.svg" || echo "missing marker ${s}.svg"
done

# Marker must be in the primary body window (not a tiny corner stamp)
for s in active drowsy sleeping deep_sleep; do
  perl -0777 -e '
    my ($file,$id)=@ARGV;
    local $/; open my $fh, "<", $file or die $!;
    my $svg=<$fh>;
    $svg =~ m{<g id="\Q$id\E"[^>]*>(.*?)</g>}s or die "missing marker group\n";
    my $g=$1;
    my @x = ($g =~ /x="(\d+)"/g); my @y = ($g =~ /y="(\d+)"/g);
    die "marker has no coords\n" unless @x && @y;
    my ($minx,$maxx)=($x[0],$x[0]); for (@x){$minx=$_ if $_<$minx; $maxx=$_ if $_>$maxx;}
    my ($miny,$maxy)=($y[0],$y[0]); for (@y){$miny=$_ if $_<$miny; $maxy=$_ if $_>$maxy;}
    die "marker out of body window: $minx,$maxx,$miny,$maxy\n" if $minx < 160 || $maxx > 352 || $miny < 160 || $maxy > 368;
    my $motif_cells = () = $g =~ /class="m"/g;
    die "marker motif too subtle: $motif_cells\n" if $motif_cells < 6;
  ' ".sprite-runtime/sprites/${s}.svg" "${MARKER_ID}" || echo "marker-check-fail ${s}.svg"
done
```

#### Reliability Hardening Gate (Ops / Deploy Skills)

If the skill touches deployment, auth, env sync, or production debugging, include an explicit anti-footgun section before finalizing.

Required checks:
- Add a preflight checklist that catches stale GitHub secrets vs local env files.
- If a change introduces new credential scopes/headers/env vars, document whether rollout requires one deploy or a two-phase deploy.
- Add a concrete failure-signature map (`HTTP code + error code`) for auth failures, not just generic "unauthorized" language.
- If the skill contains shell scripts, ensure no-arg behavior prints usage cleanly (no `${1:?}` crash UX).
- Include at least one command-first verification path for behavior and one side-effect/state verification path.

Recommended shell-script sanity checks:
```bash
# Syntax
for f in <skill>/scripts/*.sh; do bash -n "$f"; done

# No-arg UX should return usage text and non-zero
for f in <skill>/scripts/*.sh; do "$f" >/tmp/out 2>/tmp/err || true; head -n1 /tmp/out /tmp/err; done
```

#### Open-Source Readiness (Privacy Gate)

Before committing or packaging any skill for public release, scrub ALL files (SKILL.md, scripts/, references/, assets/) for:

- **Personal info**: Names, emails, phone numbers, social handles (@handle)
- **Secrets**: API keys, tokens, passwords, connection strings — even in examples
- **Hardcoded paths**: `/Users/<name>/`, `/srv/<workspace>/`, `~/repos/<specific-project>`
- **Business names**: Company names, product names, internal project names, domain names (*.yourcompany.com)
- **Real IPs/hostnames**: Server IPs, internal DNS names, container names tied to deployments
- **Referral/affiliate links**: URLs with tracking parameters (`fpr=...`, `ref=...`, etc.)
- **Business intelligence**: Customer lists, personas, targeting criteria, pricing, competitor data

**Client overlays are safe** — they live in `skillbox-config/clients/` outside the skill repo. Project-specific config belongs there, not in tracked files.

**Pattern**: Use `{placeholder}` syntax for values that vary per deployment. Scripts should accept CLI args or client overlay config instead of hardcoded defaults. Reference files should use generic examples ("auth service", "your-project") instead of real names.

**Quick check**: `grep -rE 'your-real-company|/Users/you|real-ip|@yourhandle' <skill-dir>/` before committing.

#### Open-Source Skill Architecture

Skills intended for public repos use a dual-layer pattern: **generic tracked files + private client overlays via skillbox**.

```
my-skill/                      ← public (git tracked)
├── SKILL.md                   ← generic instructions, {placeholder} variables
├── references/                ← generic patterns, workflows
├── scripts/                   ← generic utilities
└── assets/templates/          ← generic templates
    ├── default.md             ← tracked
    └── my-project.md          ← gitignored (project-specific template)

skillbox-config/clients/my-project/  ← private (outside skill repo)
└── overlay.yaml               ← project-specific: paths, names, conventions
```

**The SKILL.md reads client overlay config at runtime** to fill in `{placeholder}` values:
- `{auth_packages_root}` → overlay provides `../auth-service/packages`
- `{plan_root}` → overlay provides `~/.claude/plans/my-project`
- `{backend_repo}` → overlay provides `~/repos/my-api`

Anyone cloning the public repo gets a working generic skill. You keep your project-specific overlay in skillbox.

#### Repo-Level .gitignore for Skill Collections

For repos containing multiple skills, the root `.gitignore` should cover:

```gitignore
# Python artifacts
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# Build artifacts
*.skill
*.zip
dist/

# Project-specific skills that should never be public
my-private-skill/

# Project-specific asset variants (template naming convention)
# Example: gitignore frontend-*.md but track frontend.md
my-skill/assets/templates/frontend-*.md
!my-skill/assets/templates/frontend.md
```

**Key patterns:**
- Use `skillname/` entries for entire skills that must stay private
- Use `!` exceptions to track generic templates while ignoring project-specific variants
- Private deployment data (instance configs, deployed IPs) should have dedicated gitignore entries
- Project-specific config lives in skillbox client overlays, not in the skill repo

#### Sanitization Workflow (Existing Repo → Public)

When preparing an existing skill repo for open source:

1. **Audit tracked files**: `git ls-files | xargs grep -lE 'project-name|internal-domain|api-key-name'`
2. **Extract project content → client overlays**: Move project-specific references from SKILL.md body into skillbox client overlays (`skillbox-config/clients/{client}/overlay.yaml`). Replace with `{placeholder}` syntax referencing overlay config.
3. **Genericize examples**: Replace domain-specific slice names with generic ones ("task_assignments"). Replace internal service names with generic terms ("backend API"). Keep generic role names (operator, admin, user).
4. **Verify gitignore coverage**: Ensure project-specific templates and deployment data are excluded. Project config lives in skillbox client overlays, not in the skill repo.
5. **Final audit**: `git ls-files | xargs grep -lE 'project|company|internal'` — zero tolerance for the real names.
6. **Check git history**: If project names exist in past commits, consider `git filter-repo` or starting a clean history.

#### Handling API Keys and Secrets

Never hardcode API keys. Use `$ENV_VAR` references in curl/script templates and document the required variable.

Users should set keys in their shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):

```bash
export MY_API_KEY
```

**Known issue:** The `env` field in `~/.claude/settings.json` does not reliably expand variables in Bash tool commands. Shell profile exports work correctly.

In SKILL.md, document requirements like:

```markdown
## Prerequisites
Add to `~/.zshrc`: `export MY_API_KEY`
```

#### Local Development with Symlinks

Store skill source in a version-controlled repo, then symlink into each agent's skills directory (Claude + Codex) for discovery:

```bash
ln -s ~/repos/skills/my-skill ~/.claude/skills/my-skill
ln -s ~/repos/skills/my-skill ~/.codex/skills/my-skill
```

In this repo specifically, use `./scripts/link-skills.sh` to link all skills into both directories automatically.

The marketplace plugin version (if installed) takes precedence over local skills directories — use a different name to avoid conflicts.

#### Implement Resources First

Start with `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files identified in Step 2. This may require user input (e.g., brand assets, documentation). Test added scripts by running them. Delete unneeded example files from initialization.

#### Write SKILL.md

**Writing guidelines:** Use imperative/infinitive form.

**Frontmatter** (YAML):
- `name` (required): The skill name
- `description` (required): Primary triggering mechanism. Include what the skill does AND specific triggers/contexts. All "when to use" goes here — not in the body (which only loads after triggering).
  - Example for a `docx` skill: "Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when working with .docx files for: creating, editing, tracked changes, comments, or any document task."
- `license`, `allowed-tools`, `metadata`: Optional

**Body** (Markdown): Instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources. Keep under 500 lines — split to reference files when approaching this limit.

### Step 5: Validate and Package

Validate during development:

```bash
scripts/quick_validate.py <path/to/skill-folder>
```

Packaging writes a distributable artifact. Ask for confirmation before running `package_skill.py`. If confirmation is not given, stop at validation and report the exact packaging command.

Package when complete:

```bash
scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> [output-directory]
```

Packaging validates automatically, then creates a `.skill` file (zip with .skill extension). Fix any validation errors and re-run.
When the skill lives in a Git worktree, packaging also excludes any paths ignored by Git (repo root or skill-local), so private overlays and other gitignored artifacts stay out of the bundle.

For ops/deploy skills, do an additional manual quality pass:
- Run every documented preflight command at least once.
- Run at least one intentional failure-path probe and verify the troubleshooting guidance matches the real error.

### Commit/Push Branch (Ask First)

Do not run `git add`, `git commit`, `git tag`, `git push`, or PR creation commands unless the user explicitly asks for that branch in the current run.

If commit/push is not authorized, finish with local edits plus verification output and report the pending commands instead of executing them.

### Step 6: Iterate

1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Update SKILL.md or bundled resources
4. Test again

If you hit a production near-miss or rollback-causing mistake, treat the skill update as part of the fix:
1. Add the symptom/cause/fix to the skill's troubleshooting reference.
2. Add the prevention command/checklist to the main SKILL.md preflight section.
3. Re-run the updated checklist to prove it catches the original failure mode.

### Step 7: Publish (Optional)

Never publish by default. Ask for explicit approval before any repo creation, package upload, release creation, marketplace submission, or promotion action.

1. Create a public GitHub repo
2. Add a README.md (for humans, not Claude)
3. Add a `.zip` package: `zip -r skill-name.zip SKILL.md scripts/ references/`
4. Promote to drive downloads (downloads = ranking)

**Read `references/publishing.md`** for the complete checklist and promotion strategies.

## Environment Management

Beyond individual skills, skill-issue can audit your entire Claude environment.

### Audit

Scan `~/.claude/` and project directories, generate a context registry, and produce a health report:

```bash
scripts/audit_context.py                                 # Scan ~/repos, write to ~/.claude/context/
scripts/audit_context.py --scan-root ~/projects          # Custom scan root
scripts/audit_context.py --report-only                   # Print report without writing registry
scripts/audit_context.py --scan-root ~/repos --scan-root ~/work  # Multiple roots
```

The audit discovers: projects with `.claude/` config, CLAUDE.md files, MCP servers, project-level hooks and skills, global skills (symlinked, packaged, local), and client overlays.

Issues detected: secrets in MCP configs, broken skill symlinks, stale empty `.claude/` directories, duplicate MCP definitions across projects, client overlays targeting nonexistent paths, parent CLAUDE.md inheritance.

Registry output goes to `~/.claude/context/` with `manifest.yaml`, `projects/*.yaml`, `mcps/*.yaml`, and `machines/*.yaml`.

### Init

Bootstrap `~/.claude/context/` for a new machine or add a single project:

```bash
scripts/init_context.py                              # Interactive machine setup
scripts/init_context.py --non-interactive            # Accept all defaults
scripts/init_context.py --project ~/repos/my-app     # Add one project to existing registry
scripts/init_context.py --scan-root ~/projects       # Custom scan root
```

Full init walks through: machine name, scan roots, project discovery, and registry creation. Use `--project` to add a single project without re-scanning everything.

### Sync

Detect drift between the registry and filesystem:

```bash
scripts/sync_context.py                    # Check for drift (exit code 1 if drift found)
scripts/sync_context.py --check            # Same as above
scripts/sync_context.py --update           # Re-scan and update registry
```

Drift detection compares: project paths still exist, config files unchanged (by content hash), skills added/removed, hooks changed, MCP servers changed. Exit code 0 means no drift, 1 means drift detected.
