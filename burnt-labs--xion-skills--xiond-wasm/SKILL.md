# Xiond WASM Contract Operations

Provides scripts for deploying and interacting with CosmWasm smart contracts on the Xion blockchain. Covers the complete contract lifecycle from optimization through migration.

## Contract Developer Focus

This skill is specifically designed for CosmWasm contract developers:

1. **Optimize** - Prepare contract bytecode
2. **Upload** - Store code on chain
3. **Instantiate** - Create contract instances
4. **Execute/Query** - Interact with contracts
5. **Migrate** - Upgrade contract logic

## Integration with xion-toolkit

After deploying contracts, you can use xion-toolkit's Treasury to:
- Fund contract operations gaslessly
- Configure authz grants for contract interactions

For more information, see [xion-toolkit](https://github.com/burnt-labs/xion-agent-toolkit).

## Prerequisites

**xiond must be installed before using this skill.** If `xiond` is not found in your environment, please use the `xiond-init` skill to install it first.

## Compatibility

- Requires `bash` and `python3`
- Optimization requires Docker running locally
- Scripts print **machine-readable JSON to stdout** and progress/errors to stderr
- Supports testnet and mainnet configurations

## Network Selection

All scripts support selecting the target network:

### Using `--network` flag (Recommended)

```bash
# Use testnet (default)
bash script.sh --network testnet

# Use mainnet  
bash script.sh --network mainnet
```

### Using environment variable

```bash
export XION_NETWORK=mainnet
bash script.sh
```

### Network Endpoints

| Network | Chain ID | RPC Endpoint |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| testnet | `xion-testnet-2` | `https://rpc.xion-testnet-2.burnt.com:443` |
| mainnet | `xion-mainnet-1` | `https://rpc.xion-mainnet-1.burnt.com` |

## How It Works

1. **Optimize Contract**: Compiles and optimizes WASM contract using Docker
2. **Upload Contract**: Uploads optimized WASM bytecode to the blockchain
3. **List Codes**: View all uploaded contract codes on the chain
4. **Instantiate Contract**: Creates a contract instance with initialization parameters
5. **Query Contract**: Queries contract state without modifying blockchain
6. **Execute Contract**: Executes contract messages that modify state
7. **Migrate Contract**: Upgrades contract to a new code version
8. **Contract Info**: Query contract metadata and configuration

## Troubleshooting

**xiond Not Found:**
- Use the `xiond-init` skill to install xiond first
- Verify: `which xiond && xiond version`

**Optimization:**
- Ensure Docker is installed and running: `docker ps`
- Verify contract directory contains valid CosmWasm project
- May take several minutes for large contracts

**Upload:**
- Verify WASM file exists and is optimized
- Ensure wallet has sufficient balance for gas fees
- Large contracts may require higher gas limits

**Instantiation:**
- Verify Code ID is correct (from upload or list-codes)
- Ensure init-msg matches contract's expected schema
- Verify label is unique

**Query:**
- Verify contract address format (starts with "xion1")
- Ensure query-msg matches contract's query schema
- Contract may not exist if address is incorrect

**Execution:**
- Verify contract address and execute-msg schema
- Check wallet has sufficient balance (including gas)
- Transaction may fail if contract logic rejects the message

**Migration:**
- Wallet must be the contract admin
- Contract must have been instantiated with an admin
- New code must be uploaded first
- migrate-msg must match new code's MigrateMsg schema

## Contract Migration Notes

Migration allows upgrading a contract's logic while preserving its address and state:

1. Upload the new contract code (get new Code ID)
2. Run migrate with the new Code ID
3. The contract address stays the same, but uses new code

**Requirements:**
- Contract must have an admin set (not `--no-admin`)
- Only the admin can migrate
- Both old and new code must support migration

## Additional Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running (for optimization)
- Funded wallet account
- CosmWasm contract source code (for optimization)
