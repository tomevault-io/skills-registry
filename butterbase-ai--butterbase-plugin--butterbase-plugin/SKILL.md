# Journey Substrate Stage (optional)

Connect the deployed app to the owner's substrate so functions get `ctx.substrate` injected at cold start. Skip if the user has no AI-agent / memory use case.

## When to use

Invoke automatically when the journey orchestrator's cursor reaches `substrate`. The row is optional in the checklist; skip silently if the user declines.

## Procedure

0. **Refresh docs.** Call `butterbase_docs` with `topic: "substrate"`. If the plan mentions AI memory / agent state / cross-session knowledge, also WebFetch `https://docs.butterbase.ai/substrate`. Skip if `docs/butterbase/03b-docs-cache.md` already covers `substrate`.

1. **Confirm.** Ask the user:
   > "Connect `<app_id>` to your substrate? This lets the app's functions read/write your agent memory via `ctx.substrate`. You can disable later. (yes / skip)"

   Default: **skip**.

2. **On skip:** mark the row `- [x] substrate (skipped — no agent memory needed)` in `docs/butterbase/00-state.md`. Write `docs/butterbase/04b-substrate.md` with one line: `Skipped on <date>.` Return.

3. **On yes:**
   a. If `platform_users.substrate_provisioned_at` is NULL for the caller, call `POST /v1/me/substrate/provision` first (or invoke whatever MCP wrapper exists — check `butterbase_docs` topic `substrate`).
   b. Link the app. Use whichever surface you have:
      - **MCP:** `manage_app` with `{ action: "link_substrate", app_id: "<app_id>" }`.
      - **CLI:** `butterbase apps link-substrate <app_id>`.
      - **REST (curl):** `POST /v1/me/apps/<app_id>/substrate-link` with empty body and `Authorization: Bearer <bb_sk_*>` for the app owner. The route enforces caller == app owner and sets `apps.substrate_user_id` to the caller's id.
   c. Verify: `manage_app` with `{ action: "get_config", app_id: "<app_id>" }` and assert `substrate_user_id` is non-null.
   d. Smoke: invoke any HTTP function the app already has and check `ctx.substrate` is defined (if the function logs it). If no function exists yet, skip the smoke and note in the artifact.

4. **Write artifact.** `docs/butterbase/04b-substrate.md`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   linked_at: <ISO>
   app_id: <id>
   substrate_user_id: <id>
   ---

   # Substrate Linkage

   - App linked at <ISO>
   - Substrate user ID: <id>
   - Smoke: <pass / skipped — no function yet>
   ```

5. **Update state.** Tick the `substrate` row in `00-state.md`.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Auto-linking without asking. Substrate is a privacy-sensitive surface.
- ❌ Linking before the app has any function deployed. Wait until `journey-functions` has run.
- ❌ Forgetting to handle the "substrate not yet provisioned" case. Lazy provisioning is by design.
