# BuzzShield — Crypto Agent Security Scanner

> 47 crypto-specific rules. Scans CLAUDE.md, .env, hooks, agents, skills.
> Built on lessons from building a $0/day LLM cost production agent.

## When to Use

- Before deploying any crypto agent to production
- After adding new MCP servers or API keys
- Before hackathon submissions (catch leaks)
- As part of HSaaS security audit ($500 tier includes BuzzShield report)
- Periodic security hygiene check

## Usage

### Via Claude Code

```
/security-scan                    # Quick scan
/security-scan --deep             # Include contract analysis
/security-scan --fix              # Auto-fix safe issues
/security-scan --report markdown  # Generate HSaaS report
```

### Via CLI

```bash
npx @buzzbd/shield scan
npx @buzzbd/shield scan --fix
npx @buzzbd/shield scan --format json
```

## How It Differs from AgentShield

| Feature         | AgentShield (ECC)    | BuzzShield (Buzz)               |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Focus           | Generic dev security | Crypto agent security           |
| Secret patterns | 14 generic           | 14 generic + 14 crypto-specific |
| Wallet checks   | None                 | 9 wallet safety rules           |
| Contract audit  | None                 | 7 smart contract patterns       |
| Trust system    | None                 | Trust gate verification         |
| On-chain        | None                 | Contract ownership checks       |
| Cost            | Free                 | Free (HSaaS report = $500)      |

## Architecture

BuzzShield runs entirely in Claude Code context — no external API calls.
It reads files via Bash/Grep/Glob tools and applies regex + heuristic rules.
Zero LLM cost for scanning. LLM used only for remediation suggestions.
