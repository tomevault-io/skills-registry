# IDEA Storer (IS) Integration

A CLI tool for capturing development ideas that AI agents can understand.

## Discovery

Check for ideas in this order:
1. **Project-specific**: `.ideas.json` in current directory or git root
2. **Global fallback**: `~/.config/ideastorer/ideas.json`

## Reading Ideas

When user says "check IS", "my ideas", or "what should I work on":

1. Read the `.ideas.json` file using the Read tool
2. Parse the JSON and extract active ideas
3. Present relevant ideas based on current context
4. Suggest which ideas relate to current work

## JSON Schema

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "ideas": [
    {
      "id": "abc12345",
      "content": "The idea text",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "priority": "low|medium|high",
      "status": "active|done|archived",
      "created_at": "ISO8601",
      "context": {
        "project": "project-name",
        "git_branch": "branch-name"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## CLI Commands

```bash
is "quick idea"              # Add idea instantly
is add "idea" -t tag         # Add with tags
is list                      # Show recent ideas
is list -t tag               # Filter by tag
is search "query"            # Search ideas
is done <id>                 # Mark completed
is delete <id>               # Remove idea
is export                    # Export as JSON
is export --format md        # Export as Markdown
```

## Workflow Integration

### Before Starting Work
```
"Check IS for ideas related to [current task]"
→ Read .ideas.json
→ Filter by relevant tags
→ Present actionable items
```

### During Implementation
- Reference idea IDs in commit messages
- Cross-check implementation against stored ideas
- Suggest related ideas that could be addressed

### After Completion
```
"Mark idea <id> as done"
→ Run: is done <id>
→ Confirm completion
```

## Example Interactions

**User**: "What should I work on?"
**Action**: Read `.ideas.json`, present high-priority active ideas

**User**: "Check IS for auth ideas"
**Action**: Search ideas with "auth" or tag "authentication"

**User**: "Add to IS: implement caching"
**Action**: Run `is add "implement caching" -t performance`
