description: Use when establishing branching strategies, implementing Conventional Commits, creating or reviewing PRs, resolving PR review comments, merging PRs (including CI verification, auto-merge queues, and post-merge cleanup), managing PR review threads, merging PRs with signed commits, handling merge conflicts, or integrating Git with CI/CD.

# Git Workflow Skill

Expert patterns for Git version control: branching, commits, collaboration, and CI/CD.

## Expertise Areas

- **Branching**: Git Flow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-based development
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits, semantic versioning
- **Collaboration**: PR workflows, code review, merge strategies, thread resolution
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, branch protection

### Explicit Content Triggers

When creating pull requests, load `references/pull-request-workflow.md` for PR structure, size guidelines, and template patterns.

When reviewing PRs or responding to review comments, load `references/pull-request-workflow.md` for review comment levels (blocking/suggestion/nit) and the code review checklist.

When replying to PR review threads or resolving threads, load `references/pull-request-workflow.md` for the GraphQL API patterns for thread replies and resolution.

When merging PRs, load `references/pull-request-workflow.md` for the merge requirements checklist (resolved threads, Copilot review, rebased branch, CI checks).

When merging in repos requiring signed commits with rebase-only strategy, load `references/pull-request-workflow.md` for the local fast-forward merge workflow.

When handling merge conflicts, load `references/pull-request-workflow.md` for conflict resolution strategies.

When choosing a branching strategy, load `references/branching-strategies.md` for Git Flow, GitHub Flow, and Trunk-based patterns.

When writing commit messages, load `references/commit-conventions.md` for Conventional Commits format and semantic versioning rules.

When creating releases, load `references/github-releases.md` for immutable release warnings and recovery patterns.

When running a full PR lifecycle (CI check → resolve comments → merge → cleanup), load `references/pull-request-workflow.md` for the complete PR merge checklist.

When CI is failing on a PR and you need to fix it before merging, load `references/pull-request-workflow.md` for the CI verification and annotation checking patterns.

## Conventional Commits (Quick Reference)

```
<type>[scope]: <description>
```

**Types**: `feat` (MINOR), `fix` (PATCH), `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

**Breaking change**: Add `!` after type or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer.

## Branch Naming

```bash
feature/TICKET-123-description
fix/TICKET-456-bug-name
release/1.2.0
hotfix/1.2.1-security-patch
```

## GitHub Flow (Default)

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# ... work ...
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create && gh pr merge --squash
```

For code quality tools (shellcheck, shfmt, git-absorb, difft), see [references/code-quality-tools.md](references/code-quality-tools.md).

## GitHub Immutable Releases

**CRITICAL**: Deleted releases block tag names PERMANENTLY. Get releases right first time.

See [references/github-releases.md](references/github-releases.md) for prevention and recovery patterns.

## Verification

```bash
./scripts/verify-git-workflow.sh /path/to/repository
```
