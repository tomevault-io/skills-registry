# AgentKit Skill Download

This skill downloads skills from a specified AgentKit skill space to a local directory. It handles downloading the skill package from TOS and extracting it.

## Usage

To download skills, run the following command:

```bash
python3 scripts/skills_download.py <download_path> [--skills <skill_name1> <skill_name2> ...]
```

### Arguments

- `<download_path>`: The local directory path where the skills will be saved.
- `--skills`: (Optional) A space-separated list of specific skill names to download. If omitted, all skills in the space will be downloaded.

## Requirements

- `veadk` python package installed.
- Environment variables:
  - `VOLCENGINE_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `VOLCENGINE_SECRET_KEY`
  - `SKILL_SPACE_ID` (required, comma-separated list of skill space IDs)
  - `AGENTKIT_TOOL_REGION` (optional, defaults to cn-beijing)

## Example

Download all skills to `./my-skills`:

```bash
python3 scripts/skills_download.py ./my-skills
```

Download only `skill-a` and `skill-b`:

```bash
python3 scripts/skills_download.py ./my-skills --skills skill-a skill-b
```

## Error Handling

- IF the script raises the error `VOLCENGINE_ACCESS_KEY and VOLCENGINE_SECRET_KEY are not set in environment variables.`, inform the user that they need to provide the `VOLCENGINE_ACCESS_KEY` and `VOLCENGINE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable. Write it to the environment variable file in the workspace. If the file already exists, append it to the end. Ensure the environment variable format is correct, make the environment variable effective, and retry the task that just failed.
- IF the script raises the error `SKILL_SPACE_ID environment variable is not set`, inform the user that they need to provide the `SKILL_SPACE_ID` environment variable. Write it to the environment variable file in the workspace. If the file already exists, append it to the end. Ensure the environment variable format is correct, make the environment variable effective
