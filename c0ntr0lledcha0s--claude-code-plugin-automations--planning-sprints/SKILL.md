- Files named `sprint-*.md`, `backlog.md`, or directories like `.claude-project/sprints/` are mentioned

## How to Use This Skill

When this skill is activated:

### 1. Understand Current State
```bash
# Check GitHub project status
gh issue list --limit 100 --json number,title,labels,state,milestone

# Check sprint board status (if using GitHub Projects)
gh project list
```

### 2. Gather Sprint Context
- Review past sprint velocity
- Check team capacity for upcoming sprint
- Identify current sprint status (if mid-sprint)
- Review strategic goals and objectives

### 3. Apply Planning Framework
Use the templates and scripts in `{baseDir}`:

**Sprint Planning Template**:
```bash
cat {baseDir}/templates/sprint-plan-template.md
```

**Velocity Calculator Script**:
```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/calculate-velocity.py --sprints 3-5
```

### 4. Delegate When Needed
- For GitHub operations (creating boards, organizing issues): Delegate to **workflow-orchestrator**
- For research (understanding unknowns): Delegate to **investigator**
- For quality validation: Delegate to **self-critic**

### 5. Document Plans
Create sprint plan documents using templates from `{baseDir}/templates/`

## Prioritization Frameworks

### 1. RICE Scoring (Recommended for Product Features)

**Formula**: `Priority = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

**Scoring Guide**:
- **Reach**: How many users/customers affected per time period?
  - 0.5 = Minimal (handful of users)
  - 2.0 = Small (hundreds)
  - 5.0 = Medium (thousands)
  - 10.0 = Large (tens of thousands+)

- **Impact**: How much will this improve their experience?
  - 0.25 = Minimal improvement
  - 0.5 = Low improvement
  - 1.0 = Medium improvement
  - 2.0 = High improvement
  - 3.0 = Massive improvement

- **Confidence**: How confident are we in our estimates?
  - 0.5 = Low confidence (moonshot)
  - 0.7 = Medium confidence
  - 1.0 = High confidence (we've done this before)

- **Effort**: How much total work required? (person-months)
  - 0.5 = Minimal (days)
  - 1.0 = Low (week)
  - 3.0 = Medium (month)
  - 6.0 = High (quarter)
  - 10.0 = Massive (multiple quarters)

**Example**:
```
Feature: OAuth Login
Reach: 8.0 (thousands of users)
Impact: 2.0 (high improvement)
Confidence: 0.8 (pretty sure)
Effort: 2.0 (2 weeks)

Priority = (8.0 × 2.0 × 0.8) / 2.0 = 6.4
```

### 2. MoSCoW Method (For Release Planning)

- **Must Have**: Critical for release, non-negotiable
  - System crashes without this
  - Legal/compliance requirement
  - Blocks other must-haves

- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
  - Significant value but workarounds exist
  - Can be deferred to next release if needed
  - Minimal impact on core functionality

- **Could Have**: Nice to have if time permits
  - Desirable but not necessary
  - Small improvements
  - Can be easily removed without impacting much

- **Won't Have**: Explicitly out of scope
  - Not aligned with goals
  - Too low value for effort
  - Deferred to future releases

### 3. WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First - for SAFe)

**Formula**: `WSJF = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk/Opportunity) / Job Size`

Used for epic/feature prioritization in larger organizations.

### 4. Value vs Effort Matrix (Quick Visualization)

```
High Value │ Do First    │ Do Next
           │             │
───────────┼─────────────┼──────────
Low Value  │ Do Later    │ Avoid
           │             │
           Low Effort    High Effort
```

## Sprint Planning Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Planning (Before Sprint Begins)

**1. Backlog Refinement** (1-2 days before planning):
```markdown
- Review all backlog items
- Ensure items are well-defined with clear acceptance criteria
- Estimate unestimated items
- Remove stale or duplicate issues
- Group related work
```

**2. Capacity Calculation**:
```markdown
Team Size: [X] people
Sprint Length: [Y] days
Available Hours per Person per Day: 5-6 (accounting for meetings, etc.)

Total Capacity = X × Y × 5 hours
Subtract: PTO, holidays, commitments
Effective Capacity: [Z] hours or [P] story points
```

**3. Velocity Review**:
```markdown
Sprint N-3: [X] points completed
Sprint N-2: [Y] points completed
Sprint N-1: [Z] points completed

Average Velocity: (X + Y + Z) / 3
Use this as baseline for sprint capacity
```

### Phase 2: Sprint Planning Meeting

**1. Set Sprint Goal** (First 30 minutes):
```markdown
What is the ONE primary objective for this sprint?

Good: "Complete user authentication system"
Bad: "Work on various features"

Success Criteria:
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 1]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 2]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 3]
```

**2. Select Backlog Items** (1-2 hours):
```markdown
Process:
1. Start with highest priority items
2. Ensure they align with sprint goal
3. Check dependencies (must do before can do)
4. Estimate complexity if not yet estimated
5. Add to sprint until reaching capacity
6. Include 20% buffer for unknowns
```

**3. Task Breakdown** (1 hour):
```markdown
For each selected item:
- Break into concrete tasks
- Identify technical approach
- Assign to team members (or let team self-assign)
- Flag risks and unknowns
```

### Phase 3: During Sprint

**Daily Monitoring**:
```markdown
- Track completed vs remaining work
- Identify blockers immediately
- Adjust scope if needed (with stakeholder approval)
- Keep board updated
```

**Burndown Tracking**:
```markdown
Days Remaining vs Story Points Remaining

Ideal: Linear downward slope
Warning Signs:
- Flat line (no progress)
- Upward trend (scope creep)
- Too steep (unrealistic initial estimates)
```

### Phase 4: Sprint Close

**Sprint Review**:
```markdown
- Demo completed work
- Gather stakeholder feedback
- Celebrate wins
```

**Sprint Retrospective**:
```markdown
What went well?
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

What could be improved?
- [Item 1] → Action: [specific improvement]
- [Item 2] → Action: [specific improvement]

Action Items for Next Sprint:
- [ ] [Actionable improvement 1]
- [ ] [Actionable improvement 2]
```

**Velocity Calculation**:
```markdown
Committed: [X] story points
Completed: [Y] story points
Completion Rate: (Y / X) × 100%

Update velocity tracking for future planning
```

   - Completed: 22 story points (58%)
   - Remaining: 16 story points

2. **Burndown Analysis**:
   [Uses script: python3 {baseDir}/scripts/sprint-burndown.py]

   Ideal remaining at day 7: 11 points
   Actual remaining: 16 points
   ⚠️  Behind schedule by 5 points

3. **Status Breakdown**:
   - Done: 5 issues (22 points)
   - In Progress: 3 issues (11 points)
   - To Do: 2 issues (5 points)

4. **Blockers Identified**:
   - Issue #134: Waiting on API design review (8 points)
   - This is blocking other work

5. **Recommendations**:
   ⚠️  Sprint is tracking behind. Recommendations:

   Option 1: Descope (Recommended)
   - Move issue #140 (5 points) to next sprint
   - Focus on sprint goal completion
   - Adjusted target: 33 points (achievable)

   Option 2: Request unblocking
   - Escalate API review (issue #134)
   - If unblocked today, can complete on time

   Option 3: Extend sprint
   - Add 2 days to sprint (not recommended)

Next Steps:
- Discuss with team in standup
- Make scope decision today
- Update sprint board accordingly
```

## Best Practices

### Sprint Planning
- **Keep sprints time-boxed**: 1-2 weeks is ideal, 4 weeks maximum
- **Don't overcommit**: Use 80% of calculated capacity, not 100%
- **Have a clear sprint goal**: One focused objective, not "work on stuff"
- **Ensure items are ready**: Well-defined acceptance criteria before planning
- **Include buffer**: 20% for unknowns, tech debt, urgent bugs

### Backlog Management
- **Groom regularly**: Review backlog weekly, not just at sprint planning
- **Keep it prioritized**: Top 20 items should always be ready to work on
- **Remove stale items**: Archive issues that haven't moved in 6+ months
- **Size appropriately**: Break large items (>8 points) into smaller chunks
- **Write clearly**: Anyone on team should understand what to build

### Velocity Tracking
- **Use 3-5 sprint average**: Not just the last sprint
- **Account for team changes**: New members reduce short-term velocity
- **Track completion rate**: Committed vs completed (aim for 90%+)
- **Watch trends**: Declining velocity indicates problems
- **Don't use velocity for cross-team comparison**: Each team's points are different

### Capacity Planning
- **Be realistic**: 5-6 productive hours per day, not 8
- **Account for meetings**: Standups, planning, reviews, retros
- **Include PTO and holidays**: Check team calendar
- **Consider commitments**: On-call rotations, interviews, etc.
- **New team members**: Count at 50% capacity for first sprint

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Scope Creep**: Adding work mid-sprint without removing something
❌ **No Sprint Goal**: Just a random collection of issues
❌ **Overcommitting**: Taking on more than historical velocity
❌ **Not Breaking Down Work**: Including large, vague items
❌ **Skipping Retrospectives**: Missing improvement opportunities
❌ **Carrying Over Too Much**: If >30% rolls over, sprints are too ambitious
❌ **Working on Non-Sprint Items**: Breaks focus and planning
❌ **No Daily Updates**: Board doesn't reflect reality

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works well with:

- **coordinating-projects**: For multi-project sprint coordination
- **github-workflows skills**: For GitHub board and issue operations
- **research-agent skills**: For estimating unknowns
- **self-improvement skills**: For validating sprint plans

When planning sprints, you may automatically delegate to:
- `workflow-orchestrator` for GitHub operations
- `investigator` for research on unknowns
- `self-critic` for plan quality validation

## Important Notes

- This skill is automatically invoked when sprint planning keywords are detected
- Scripts in `{baseDir}/scripts/` can process GitHub data via gh CLI
- Templates in `{baseDir}/templates/` provide consistent structure
- Always balance planning with execution - don't over-plan
- Agile is iterative - plans will change, and that's okay
- Focus on delivering value, not just completing points

## Success Metrics

Sprint planning is successful when:
- ✅ Sprint goals are clear and achieved >80% of the time
- ✅ Velocity is predictable (variance <20%)
- ✅ Completion rate is >90% (committed vs completed)
- ✅ Team morale is high (retrospectives show improvement)
- ✅ Stakeholders are satisfied with predictability
- ✅ Technical debt is balanced with feature work

Remember: **Sprint planning is about creating focus and predictability, not perfect plans.** Be flexible, learn from each sprint, and continuously improve.
