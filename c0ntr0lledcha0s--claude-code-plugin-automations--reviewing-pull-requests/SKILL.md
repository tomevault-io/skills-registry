### 5. **Self-Improvement Integration**

**Invoke quality check** (if plugin available):
```markdown
For every PR review:
1. Check if self-improvement plugin is installed
2. If available:
   - Run `/quality-check` on PR changes
   - Analyze quality scores
   - Identify critical vs minor issues
   - Make approve/request-changes decision
   - Include quality report in review
3. If NOT available:
   - Use basic quality checks (CI, tests, security)
   - Perform manual code review
   - Recommend installing self-improvement plugin
```

**Quality score thresholds** (when self-improvement plugin available):
- **Auto-approve**: All scores >= 4, no critical issues
- **Request changes**: Correctness < 3, Security < 3, or critical issues
- **Comment**: Minor issues only

### 6. **Merge Strategies**

**Merge methods**:

**Merge commit** (default):
```
Preserves full history
Good for: Feature branches, release branches
```

**Squash and merge**:
```
Combines all commits into one
Good for: Small features, bug fixes, clean history
```

**Rebase and merge**:
```
Linear history, no merge commits
Good for: Clean linear history, feature branches
```

**When to use each**:
- **Merge commit**: Feature branches with good commit history
- **Squash**: Multiple WIP commits, want clean history
- **Rebase**: Want linear history, commits already clean
