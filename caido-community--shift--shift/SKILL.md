# Agent Context Management

## Overview

AI agents operate within a fixed context window. System prompts, user messages, tool outputs, and injected context (HTTP requests, responses, skills, etc.) all consume tokens. Exceeding the limit causes failures or degraded behavior.

**Core principle**: Truncate when necessary, but never silently. Always make truncation visible and give the agent a path to access full data when needed.

## What to Be Careful About

- **System prompt**: Keep instructions concise. Avoid redundant or verbose sections.
- **Context blocks**: HTTP requests, responses, learnings, payload blobs, environment variables.
- **User messages**: Long pasted content or multi-turn history.
- **Tool outputs**: Large strings returned from tools (responses, binary output, workflow results).
- **Skills and agent instructions**: Can grow unbounded if many are selected.

## Truncation Rules

### 1. Always Add a Clear Truncation Marker

When truncating, append an explicit marker so the agent knows content was cut:

```
...[truncated]...
```

or with metadata:

```
[...truncated. 45000 characters remaining. Response ID: abc123]
```

Include:
- That truncation occurred
- How much was omitted (characters/bytes)
- Any identifier needed to fetch more (e.g. response ID, blob ID)

### 2. Prefer Head + Tail Over Head-Only

For long content, show both start and end so the agent sees structure:

```
[first N chars]...[truncated]...[last M chars]
```

This helps with HTTP requests (headers + body tail), JSON, and similar structured data.

### 3. Truncation Marker Template

```typescript
const TRUNCATION_MARKER = "\n...[truncated]...\n";

function truncateContextValue(value: string, maxLength: number): string {
  if (value.length <= maxLength) return value;
  const remaining = maxLength - TRUNCATION_MARKER.length;
  const headLength = Math.ceil(remaining / 2);
  const tailLength = Math.max(0, remaining - headLength);
  return `${value.slice(0, headLength)}${TRUNCATION_MARKER}${value.slice(value.length - tailLength)}`;
}
```

## Provide Access to Full Data

If you truncate, the agent must be able to retrieve the rest. Implement one or more of:

### Chunked Reading

Expose a tool that reads a range (offset, limit) of the full content:

```
RequestRangeRead(offset: number, limit: number) → content, totalLength, truncated
ResponseRangeRead(responseId, startIndex, endIndex) → content, truncated
```

Document in the system prompt that truncated content can be inspected via these tools.

### Search

For large responses or logs, provide search so the agent can find relevant sections:

```
ResponseSearch(responseId, pattern) → [{ startIndex, endIndex, context }]
```

Then use chunked read around the matches.

### Blob Storage

For generated content the agent needs to reference later (e.g. large payloads):

```
PayloadBlobCreate(content) → blobId
```

Store full content server-side; inject only `blobId`, length, and a short preview into context. The agent references `§§§Blob§blobId§§§` in tool inputs to substitute the full content when needed.

## System Prompt Guidance

When truncation is possible, add explicit instructions:

```
If the visible <current_http_request> appears truncated, use RequestRangeRead with offset and limit to inspect additional request chunks before applying precise raw edits.
```

For responses:

```
Responses may be truncated. Use ResponseSearch to find patterns, then ResponseRangeRead with startIndex/endIndex to read specific sections.
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Truncation uses a visible marker (never silent cut)
- [ ] Marker includes remaining size or identifier when useful
- [ ] Head + tail used for structured content
- [ ] Tool exists for chunked reading of truncated content
- [ ] Search tool available when content is large and searchable
- [ ] Blob/payload storage for generated content that exceeds context
- [ ] System prompt tells the agent how to access full data when truncated
