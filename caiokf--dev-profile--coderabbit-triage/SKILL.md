# Triaging Issues

## Overview

This skill transforms CodeRabbit's raw findings into an executable task plan. It analyzes issues by severity, checks for dependencies, and decides the optimal execution strategy (parallel fixers vs sequential).

**Input**: JSON from `coderabbit-request`

**Output**: Structured task dispatch plan with fixer instructions

**When to use**: After CodeRabbit review completes, before dispatching fixer subagents.

## Decision Logic

### Step 1: Count and Categorize

Analyze the issue distribution:

```text
Critical (security, data corruption, crashes):
  - Race conditions, missing auth/validation, unsafe state mutations
  - Must fix immediately, cannot ship with these

Important (bugs, performance issues, missing error handling):
  - Logic errors, performance regressions, unhandled edge cases
  - Should fix before merge, affects product quality

Minor (style, simplification, documentation):
  - Code clarity, pattern consistency, comments
  - Can defer but should fix for consistency
```

### Step 2: Identify Independent Domains

For critical issues, check if they're in the same domain:

**Independent** (can fix in parallel):

- Race condition in webhook async handler (domain: concurrency)
- Missing signature verification (domain: security)
- Missing error logging (domain: observability)

**Dependent** (must fix sequentially):

- Missing signature verification depends on understanding webhook flow
- Missing error handling in same flow that signature relies on
- Both in same file and related code paths

**Same domain** (likely sequential):

- Race condition in webhook handler AND race condition in retry logic
- Both race conditions, likely need same fix pattern

### Step 3: Check File/Region Overlap

Before deciding strategy, check if issues share files or have overlapping line ranges:

```text
File overlap check:
  - Group all issues by file path
  - If multiple issues target the same file → they are DEPENDENT
  - Same-file issues cannot run in parallel (risk of merge conflicts)

Region overlap check (for same-file issues):
  - If line ranges overlap or are within 20 lines → tightly coupled
  - If line ranges are far apart but same file → still dependent (file lock)

Example:
  Task 1: src/webhooks.ts:42 (signature verification)
  Task 2: src/webhooks.ts:89 (idempotency handling)
  Task 3: src/webhooks.ts:156 (error logging)
  → All target same file → DEPENDENT → use SINGLE_COMPREHENSIVE or BATCH_SEQUENTIAL
```

### Step 4: Decide Execution Strategy

```text
IF 0 critical issues:
  Strategy: "COMPLETE"
  Status: "No critical issues found"
  Offer: "Fix important + minor issues?"

IF 1-3 critical AND all in DIFFERENT files AND non-overlapping:
  Strategy: "PARALLEL_CRITICAL"
  Pattern: Dispatch each critical as separate subagent
  Then: Sequential important/minor fixers
  Prerequisite: No two critical issues share the same file

IF critical issues share same file OR have overlapping regions:
  Strategy: "SINGLE_COMPREHENSIVE"
  Pattern: One fixer with full file context handles all issues in that file
  Reason: Prevents merge conflicts, simpler coordination for same-file edits

IF 3+ critical OR critical issues have logical dependencies:
  Strategy: "SEQUENTIAL"
  Pattern: Fix each critical, verify, then move to next
  Reason: Complex dependencies require verification between fixes

IF only important/minor (no critical):
  Strategy: "BATCH_SEQUENTIAL"
  Pattern: Group by file, fix each file completely before moving to next
  Reason: Reduces context switching, prevents same-file conflicts
```

### Step 5: Create Task Dispatch Plan

For each issue, create a fixer task:

```json
{
  "total_issues": 3,
  "by_severity": {
    "critical": 1,
    "important": 2,
    "minor": 0

## Verification Checklist

Before returning plan, verify:

- [ ] Every issue has a task_id
- [ ] Severity is accurately assessed
- [ ] Dependencies identified correctly
- [ ] Strategy choice justified by analysis
- [ ] Fixer instructions are clear and specific
- [ ] Constraints explicitly listed
- [ ] Estimated times are realistic
- [ ] Parallel groups don't have conflicts
- [ ] All CodeRabbit suggestions referenced

## Key Principles

**Analysis over assumption**: Check real dependencies, don't assume everything is parallel.

**Clarity for fixers**: Fixer subagents need exact step-by-step instructions, not vague guidance.

**Constraint enforcement**: Tell fixers explicitly what NOT to change, prevents scope creep.

**Transparency**: Explain WHY you chose a strategy, not just what it is.

## Common Patterns

**All independent critical issues (different files)**:

```json
{
  "strategy": "PARALLEL_CRITICAL",
  "analysis": {
    "files_are_independent": true,
    "no_file_overlap": true
  },
  "tasks": [
    {"task_id": 1, "file": "src/auth.ts", "can_run_parallel_with": [2, 3]},
    {"task_id": 2, "file": "src/payments.ts", "can_run_parallel_with": [1, 3]},
    {"task_id": 3, "file": "src/notifications.ts", "can_run_parallel_with": [1, 2]}
  ]
}
```

**Mix of critical and important**:

```json
{
  "strategy": "SEQUENTIAL_WITH_PARALLEL_IMPORTANT",
  "phase_1": ["critical issues"],
  "phase_2": ["important issues in parallel"]
}
```

**Complex interdependencies**:

```json
{
  "strategy": "SEQUENTIAL",
  "must_complete_before": {
    "task_2": ["task_1"],
    "task_3": ["task_1", "task_2"]
  }
}
```

## Integration Points

```text
coderabbit-request
        ↓ (outputs JSON)
coderabbit-triage
        ↓ (outputs task plan)
coderabbit-fix (dispatched per task)
```

Return structured task plan. Main agent will dispatch fixer subagents based on strategy and parallelization groups.
