# Architecture Review Skill

## Goal
Produce a **production-grade architecture review document** for a non-trivial Python RAG system.

The output must be a **prioritised, implementation-ready task backlog** that a senior engineering team can directly execute to harden the system for production.

The review must explicitly evaluate:
1. The current implementation
2. The stated architecture document (`RAG_ARCHITECTURE.md`)
3. Known, explicitly deferred architectural areas

---

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when the user asks to:
- Review a RAG or LLM system for production readiness
- Audit architecture compliance
- Identify gaps, risks, or missing safeguards
- Produce a structured backlog for engineering execution

---

## Instructions

1. Assume the system is **non-trivial and already deployed** in at least one environment.
2. Assume the audience is **senior engineers**.
3. Evaluate the codebase against:
   - Production engineering standards
   - The architecture document
   - Explicit architectural constraints (including deferred areas)
4. Produce **one table per category**, in the exact order specified below.
5. Each task must be **concrete, opinionated, and actionable**.
6. Do **not** explain code line-by-line.
7. Focus on **what must be done**, not how the system generally works.

---

## Categories
(Create **EXACTLY one table per category**, in this order)

1. Architecture & System Design  
2. RAG Pipeline (Ingestion, Retrieval, Reranking, Generation)  
3. Prompting & Grounding Controls  
4. Code Quality & Python Practices  
5. Observability & Operations  
6. Evaluation & Quality Measurement  
7. Security, Privacy & Data Risks  
8. Performance, Latency & Cost  
9. Testing Strategy  

---

## Table Format (MANDATORY)

Each table must contain **EXACTLY** the following columns, in this order:
