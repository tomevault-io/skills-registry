# Hypermedia development

This guide covers server-first hypermedia architecture for building web applications where the backend is the source of truth for both application state and UI rendering.

**Primary paradigm:** Server-driven UI - the server generates HTML fragments and pushes them to the browser via Server-Sent Events (SSE), eliminating client-side state management complexity.

**Core philosophy (Tao of Datastar):**
- Most state should live in the backend as the single source of truth
- In Morph We Trust: send large DOM chunks, let morphing handle minimal updates
- Use loading indicators rather than optimistic updates that deceive users
- CQRS pattern: single long-lived SSE for reads, short-lived requests for writes

**Contrast with SPA architectures:**
- Hypermedia: `Server → HTML → Browser native DOM`
- SPA: `Server → JSON → Client framework → Virtual DOM → Render`

This paradigm complements functional domain modeling by maintaining clear effect boundaries: pure domain logic (sync), application orchestration (async/SSE), and infrastructure (I/O).
Side effects should be explicit in type signatures and isolated at boundaries to preserve compositionality.
In Rust (Ironstar), the async/sync boundary is the effect boundary: if a function is `async`, it performs I/O; if sync, it is pure.
The Decider pattern (fmodel-rust) enforces this structurally: `decide` and `evolve` are pure synchronous functions; all I/O occurs at the axum/Zenoh boundary.

## When to use hypermedia architecture

**Choose hypermedia when:**
- Server is authoritative for application state and business logic
- UI updates can tolerate server round-trip latency (CRUD apps, dashboards, content sites)
- You want minimal client-side JavaScript and bundle sizes
- Real-time updates are server-pushed (notifications, live data)

**For standalone documents (no server):**
When the document is self-contained and does not need server state (experiments, presentations, visualizations), see `~/.claude/skills/preferences-hypermedia-documents/SKILL.md` for the standalone authoring patterns that share the same design system and progressive enhancement approach.

**Reconsider when:**
- Application requires offline-first functionality
- Ultra-low-latency interactions are critical (collaborative drawing, real-time gaming)
- UI is highly stateful with complex client-side transitions (video editor, CAD tool)

## Technology ecosystem

**Hypermedia frameworks:** Datastar, htmx, Turbo (Hotwire)

**Backend SDKs (Datastar):** Go, Rust, PHP, Python, .NET, Ruby, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, Clojure

**CSS architecture:** Open Props (design tokens), Open Props UI (copy-paste components)

**Web component approaches:** Vanilla web components, Lit (for complex lifecycle management)

**Templating (by language):**
- Rust: hypertext (lazy), maud (eager), askama (file-based)
- Go: templ (type-safe)
- Python: htpy (type-safe), Jinja2 (ecosystem standard)
- TypeScript: JSX/TSX with TypeScript

**Reference implementations:**

Ironstar (`~/projects/rust-workspace/ironstar`) is the canonical Rust integration of algebraic DDD with hypermedia architecture.
It demonstrates the Decider pattern (fmodel-rust) for pure domain logic, embedded infrastructure (SQLite event store, Zenoh pub/sub, DuckDB analytics, moka cache), Open Props + CUBE CSS cascade layer architecture, hypertext lazy templates with datastar-rust SSE events, and Idris2 formal specifications for domain model verification.
See the repo's CLAUDE.md for the authoritative architectural context.

Stario (`~/projects/lakescope-workspace/stario`) is an illustrative Python 3.14+ framework for Datastar integration.
It demonstrates the Go-style handler pattern `(Context, Writer) -> None`, declarative HTML element functions, `data`/`at` Datastar attribute helpers, and the Relay in-process pub/sub system for broadcasting events across SSE connections.
