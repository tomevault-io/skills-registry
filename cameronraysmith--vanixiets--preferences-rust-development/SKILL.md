# Rust development

This guide integrates functional domain modeling (FDM) with pragmatic Rust practices from Microsoft engineers.

**Primary lens:** Functional domain modeling - type-driven design encoding business logic in the type system, making invariants explicit and violations compile-time errors.

**Complementary guidance:** Microsoft Pragmatic Rust Guidelines - industry best practices for API design, testing, performance, and safety.

**Philosophical reconciliations:**

- *Panic semantics*: Panics for true programming bugs only (contract violations, impossible states).
Domain and infrastructure errors use Result types.
Good type design reduces both panic surface and error handling complexity.
- *Dependency injection*: Prefer concrete types for domain logic, enums for testable I/O (sans-io), generics for algorithm parameters, dyn Trait only for true runtime polymorphism.
This hierarchy complements FDM's emphasis on explicit, type-safe dependencies.
- *Type-driven design*: Both approaches emphasize making invalid states unrepresentable.
Smart constructors, state machines, and strong types eliminate bug categories.

**Role in multi-language architectures:** Rust often serves as the base IO/Result layer in multi-language monad transformer stacks, providing memory-safe, high-performance foundations for effect composition.
