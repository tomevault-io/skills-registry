# Session orientation

Symlink location: `~/.claude/skills/session-orient/SKILL.md`
Slash command: `/session-orient`

Session start protocol that assembles context from all available sources, calibrates work selection by Cynefin domain and planning-depth, and produces a briefing that enables the worker to self-direct.
This skill operates at the strategic planning horizon, reading the full remaining scope at low resolution.

This is the default session start command for repositories with the full stigmergic workflow installed.
For repositories without the full workflow (no session-layer skills, small utility repos, quick fixes), use `/issues-beads-orient` directly.

## Theoretical grounding

This skill is one component of a lifecycle that co-optimizes planning time against execution time.
The underlying model: planning depth has an optimal finite value where marginal yield from one additional planned step equals marginal accuracy loss and planning cost.
This optimum *decreases* as agent execution capacity increases — more agents demand shallower, faster planning cycles to avoid starving them on stale plans.
Model Predictive Control provides the structural answer: plan over a finite prediction horizon, commit only to a shorter control horizon of items dispatched to agents, then re-observe actual codebase state and replan from scratch.
Cynefin domain classification makes planning depth per-item rather than global: clear-domain work (known patterns) is planned far ahead at low cost, while complex-domain work (emergent behavior) is planned only as probes whose outcomes inform the next cycle.
The Viable System Model maps this to an organizational lifecycle where each session skill implements a specific regulatory function: System 4 (orient), System 3 (plan), System 1 (implement), System 3* (review), System 5 (checkpoint).
Stigmergic coordination binds it together — agents orient by reading structured signal tables on the issue DAG rather than receiving centralized briefings, achieving near-optimal throughput via local sensing and acting.
Queue economics calibrates the pipeline: buffer sizing via Little's Law, agent utilization at 70-85% (not 100%, due to queueing instability), and batch sizing via the U-curve between planning overhead and plan staleness.

This skill implements System 4: strategic scanning and environmental intelligence.
It reads the full remaining scope at low resolution, assembles signal tables from the DAG, and produces a calibrated briefing whose depth is modulated by each issue's Cynefin classification and planning-depth signal.
The depth modulation directly operationalizes the MPC insight — invest analysis effort where cause-effect relationships are knowable (complicated domain, standard depth) and substitute exploration directives where they are not (complex domain, deep depth with probe-first phase).

This skill operates under the reflexive severity mandate: when patterns suggest the framework itself is producing poor outcomes, the agent's obligation is to pause and surface the observation rather than pressing on.
See the double-loop learning triggers in `preferences-validation-assurance` and the reflexive severity framework in `preferences-adaptive-planning`.

For the full theoretical derivation including the R_plan(d) formulation, buffer sizing heuristic, and validation gate placement theory, see `preferences-adaptive-planning`.

## Composed skills

This skill orchestrates a higher-level protocol that uses the following skills as components.
Do not duplicate their functionality; delegate to them.

- `/issues-beads-orient` provides DAG diagnostics and work selection (phase 1 graph-wide scan, phase 2 signal-table-driven briefing).
- `/stigmergic-convention` provides the signal table schema, field definitions, and read-modify-write protocol for parsing and interpreting signal tables on candidate issues.

Load `/issues-beads-prime` for core beads conventions and command quick reference before running orientation commands.

## Protocol

Execute the following steps in order.

### Step 1: load beads-orient diagnostics

Delegate the graph-wide scan to `/issues-beads-orient` phase 1.
Run `bd status`, `bd epic status`, `bd ready`, and `bd blocked` to establish the current state of the issue graph.

```bash
bd status
bd stale
bd epic status
```

For structured data when analyzing larger graphs:

```bash
bd ready
bd blocked
```

Extract the three prioritization perspectives described in `/issues-beads-orient`: parallel entry points, critical path, and high-impact items.
Use the structural integrity checks from that skill (empty epic detection, orphan issue detection) to verify graph health before proceeding.

### Step 2: read AMDiRE documentation relevant to the selected work area

For each candidate issue, identify the documentation tree path covering architecture decisions, specifications, context documents, and research notes.
Load relevant documentation to provide domain context beyond what the issue description contains.

Locate documentation by scanning the repository's `docs/` directory structure and any paths referenced in the candidate issue's description or notes.
Architecture decisions (ADRs), specification documents, and context notes provide the domain background needed to calibrate the briefing.

When documentation references exist but the files are absent or outdated, note this as a gap in the synthesis output.
Missing documentation in a complex-domain issue increases the case for exploration phase directives in step 6.

### Step 3: documentation health check

Before producing the synthesis, scan the repository's documentation tree for staleness, orphans, and supersession issues that affect the quality of the briefing.

#### Staleness scan

Check `docs/notes/` for files whose last meaningful git commit is 45+ days old that are referenced by open beads issues.
These are potentially stale notes informing active work.
For `docs/development/` specifications, use a 90-day threshold.

When a document has `last-validated:` frontmatter, use that date for staleness comparison rather than file modification time.
This distinguishes content validation from incidental edits (typo fixes, formatting).
Fall back to the file's last git commit date when no `last-validated:` field exists.
Do not use filesystem modification time (mtime), which is unreliable after `git checkout`, `git rebase`, and similar operations.

```bash
# Last meaningful commit date for a file (use instead of filesystem mtime)
git log --follow -1 --format='%ai' -- <file>

# Staleness check: compare git commit date against threshold
# docs/notes/: 45 days, docs/development/: 90 days
# Check flagged files for last-validated frontmatter override
rg -l 'last-validated:' docs/notes/ docs/development/ 2>/dev/null
```

For files with `last-validated:` frontmatter, compare that date against the staleness threshold instead of the mtime result.
A file modified yesterday for formatting but last validated 60 days ago is stale; a file unmodified for 50 days but validated 30 days ago is not.

Cross-reference flagged files against open issue descriptions and notes to determine whether active work depends on stale documentation.

#### Orphan detection

Identify docs not referenced by CLAUDE.md, any beads issue description, or any other doc in the tree.
These are candidates for review: they may be valuable but disconnected, or they may be forgotten drafts.

#### Supersession cleanup

Check for files with `superseded-by` frontmatter older than 30 days.
These should have been deleted or archived; flag for cleanup.

```bash
rg -l 'superseded-by:' docs/ 2>/dev/null
```

#### Project re-entry detection

If the most recent checkpoint in the beads graph is older than 45 days, this is a project re-entry scenario.
Expand the documentation health check to a full sweep and include a triage summary with recommended actions (update, refactor, merge, delete) for each flagged doc.

#### CLAUDE.md currency check

Compare the project's CLAUDE.md "Current priorities" and "Current orientation" sections against the beads graph state.
If the stated priorities reference closed issues or the orientation describes completed work, flag for update.

#### Diagram source staleness

Compare last git commit dates of diagram source files (`.d2`, `.tex`, `.mmd`) against code areas they depict.
When a diagram's depicted scope has significant code churn since the diagram was last updated, flag it as potentially stale.
The `preferences-architecture-diagramming` skill defines the diagram categories and their C4 level anchoring; the staleness check here determines whether existing diagrams still reflect reality.

```bash
# Find diagram source files and their modification times
fd -e d2 -e tex -e mmd . docs/ 2>/dev/null
```

Cross-reference flagged diagrams against the compendium categories in `preferences-architecture-diagramming/04-diagram-compendium.md` to assess coverage gaps.
Report missing C4 levels alongside stale diagrams so the worker can prioritize updates and new diagram creation together.

Staleness thresholds vary by Cynefin domain, consistent with the adaptive planning calibration in `preferences-adaptive-planning`.
Clear-domain diagrams tolerate longer intervals between updates because the depicted structure changes infrequently.
Complex-domain diagrams require shorter review cycles because the system they depict is evolving through probes and emergent design.

#### Planning repo context integrity

In planning repos with `contexts/*.md`, verify symlink integrity: do targets exist?
Flag context files whose source repos have had significant changes since the context was last updated.

```bash
# Check for broken symlinks in contexts/
fd -t l --broken . contexts/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 4: parse signal tables on candidate issues

For each candidate issue, extract the signal table from the issue's notes field using the delimiter-based parsing protocol from `/stigmergic-convention`.

```bash
bd show <id> --json | jq -r '.[0].notes // ""'
```

Parse the block between `<!-- stigmergic-signals -->` and `<!-- /stigmergic-signals -->` delimiters.
Read the following values:

- *schema-version* (integer, currently `1`)
- *cynefin* (clear, complicated, complex, chaotic)
- *planning-depth* (shallow, standard, deep, probe)
- *surprise* (0.0 to 1.0)
- *progress* (not-started, exploring, implementing, verifying, blocked)
- *escalation* (none, pending, resolved)

If *schema-version* is absent, treat the table as version 1.
If *schema-version* is present and not `1`, warn the worker that the signal table uses an unrecognized schema version and that field semantics may have changed.
Continue parsing best-effort but surface the warning prominently in the step 7 synthesis.

When no signal table exists, apply defaults: cynefin=complicated, surprise=0.0, progress=not-started, escalation=none, planning-depth=standard.

Additionally, read the confidence signals from the same signal table:

- *confidence* (`undemonstrated`, `finding-recorded`, `prototype`, `locally-verified`, `integration-verified`, `validated`, `regression-protected`, `regressed`)
- *evidence-freshness* (ISO date or `—`)
- *regression-guard* (`none`, `manual`, `automated`, `runtime`)

When confidence signals are absent, apply defaults: confidence=undemonstrated, evidence-freshness=absent, regression-guard=none.

If escalation is `resolved`, extract the resolution from the `<!-- escalation-context -->` section and surface it prominently.
If escalation is `pending`, inform the worker that an unresolved question exists and assess whether it blocks the candidate.

### Step 5: calibrate briefing depth per planning-depth signal

Assemble the briefing based on the planning-depth value.
Planning-depth is derived from the Cynefin classification by default but can be manually overridden.

At *shallow* depth (clear domain): emit acceptance criteria and verification commands only.
The worker knows how to do this kind of work; they need to know what to produce and how to verify it.
Omit dependency context unless a closed dependency changed an interface the worker must target.

At *standard* depth (complicated domain): emit full context including the issue description, all closed dependency closure context in topological order, resolved escalations, and complete acceptance criteria with verification commands.
If the surprise score from a prior worker exceeds 0.3, highlight the divergence and include checkpoint context that explains what was unexpected.

At *deep* depth (complex domain): emit everything from standard plus explicit exploration phase directives.
Separate "what we know" (from dependency context and prior checkpoint context) from "what we need to discover" (from the issue description's open questions or areas where surprise was high).
Instruct the worker to checkpoint after exploration before implementing.

At *probe* depth (chaotic domain): emit a minimal commitment directive focusing on hypothesis, smallest intervention, and rapid feedback loop.
The worker acts first to stabilize, senses what happened, then checkpoints with observations.
Long-term planning is explicitly deferred.

### Step 6: produce exploration phase directives for complex and chaotic domains

When planning-depth is *deep* or *probe*, orient shifts from "read the landscape" to "explore the problem space."
This is discovery mode, activated within orient rather than as a separate command.

Structure the output to separate known information from open questions:

*Known* (assembled from closed dependency closure reasons, checkpoint context, and documentation):
- What has been implemented and verified in upstream dependencies
- What interfaces and constraints exist from prior work
- What the documentation establishes about the domain
- What confidence levels upstream dependencies have actually earned and whether their evidence is fresh

*Unknown* (identified from the issue description, documentation gaps, and high surprise scores):
- Questions the issue description leaves open
- Areas where prior workers reported high surprise
- Gaps between documentation and observed reality

Direct the worker to:
1. Spend their first phase probing the problem space before committing to an implementation approach.
2. Set progress=exploring initially via signal table update.
3. Checkpoint after exploration with findings (what was discovered, what approach is recommended, what risks remain).
4. Update progress=implementing only after the exploration checkpoint.

For *probe* depth specifically, frame the exploration as hypothesis testing.
Define the hypothesis, the smallest intervention that could confirm or refute it, and the feedback mechanism for observing results.
The worker is expected to act-sense-respond rather than sense-analyze-respond.

### Step 7: present synthesis with prioritization and work plan

Combine the diagnostics from step 1, documentation context from step 2, documentation health from step 3, signal table state from step 4, and calibrated briefing from steps 5-6 into a single coherent output.

The synthesis includes:

*Health overview*: open/ready/blocked ratio, epic progress, alerts from stale issues or graph health warnings.

*Candidate assessment*: for each candidate issue, the Cynefin classification, planning-depth, surprise score, escalation state, confidence level, evidence-freshness, regression-guard status, and documentation coverage.

*Calibrated briefing*: the depth-appropriate briefing assembled in step 5, with exploration directives from step 6 when applicable.

*Work plan with phase recommendation*:
- Recommend `/session-plan` if the operational buffer is depleted (few ready issues relative to work capacity) or if decomposition is needed before implementation can begin.
- Recommend proceeding to implementation if the operational buffer is full and selected issues are ready with clear acceptance criteria.
- Recommend discovery mode (within this orient session) if planning-depth is deep or probe, before either planning or implementing.
- Recommend validation or regression-protection work when a candidate's implementation is ahead of its evidence: code exists and tests pass but confidence is still `prototype` or `undemonstrated`, indicating the evidence hasn't been assessed for severity.
Also flag when closed issues in the epic have weak regression protection (`regression-guard` = `none` on `validated` or higher confidence work).

*Cross-project context* (when available): any cross-repo references discovered during orientation, with confidence levels for each (see the cross-project context loading section below).

## Cross-project context loading

When operating in multi-repo ecosystems, session-orient assembles cross-project context to provide visibility beyond the current repository's DAG.
This context is advisory, not authoritative: it reflects the last-known state of external repositories and may be stale.

### Scan for cross-references

Examine issue descriptions and notes for cross-repo references using the format `see {prefix}-{id} in {repo}`.
This format is the convention for description cross-references between paired epics and their children across repositories.

When cross-references are found:

1. Check whether the referenced repository is accessible on the local filesystem.
2. If accessible, load the referenced issue's status and checkpoint context from that repository's beads database.
3. If not accessible, note the cross-reference as unresolvable and include only the information available in the local issue's description and notes.

### Load referenced issue status

For each resolvable cross-reference, query the external repository's beads database:

```bash
# From the external repo's working directory
bd show <referenced-id> --json | jq '.[0] | {id, title, status, close_reason, notes}'
```

Extract the referenced issue's status (open, in_progress, closed), closure reason if closed, and any checkpoint context from its notes field.
This provides the current state of the external dependency without requiring synchronous coordination between repositories.

### Leverage context symlinks in planning repos

Planning repositories may maintain `contexts/*.md` symlinks pointing to each project repo's `CLAUDE.md`.
When the current repository is a planning repo or when the planning repo is accessible on the local filesystem, read these symlinks to survey project-level architectural decisions and current state across the ecosystem.

```bash
# List available context symlinks
ls contexts/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

Each context file represents a project's orientation document.
Read them to understand cross-project constraints, shared conventions, and architectural decisions that affect the current work.

### Synthesize with confidence levels

Present cross-project context with explicit confidence ratings:

*High confidence*: the referenced repository was accessible and the issue's current status was read directly from its beads database.
The information is current as of the local filesystem state.

*Moderate confidence*: the referenced repository was accessible but the specific issue could not be found, or the issue exists but has no checkpoint context.
The cross-reference in the local issue's description provides partial information.

*Low confidence*: the referenced repository was not accessible on the local filesystem.
Only the prose cross-reference in the local issue's description is available.
The actual state of the external work is unknown.

Include the confidence level with each piece of cross-project context so the worker can weight it appropriately in their planning.

### Cross-project context integration with briefing depth

Cross-project context modulates the briefing in the same way as local context:

At *shallow* depth: mention cross-project references only if they affect interfaces the worker must target.

At *standard* depth: include cross-project dependency status and any propagated checkpoint context.

At *deep* depth: include everything from standard plus analysis of how cross-project state affects the exploration phase.
Unknown cross-project state (low confidence references) becomes an explicit item in the "what we need to discover" section.

At *probe* depth: include only cross-project context that directly informs the hypothesis or intervention design.

## Typical next steps

After orientation completes, the worker proceeds to one of:

- `/session-plan` if decomposition is needed (operational buffer depleted, scope unclear, or new epic requiring breakdown).
- Implementation if the operational buffer is full and the selected issue has clear acceptance criteria and verification commands.
- Discovery mode within this orient session if planning-depth is deep or probe, followed by `/session-checkpoint` after exploration and then either `/session-plan` or implementation.
