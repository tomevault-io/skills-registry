# Session planning

Symlink location: `~/.claude/skills/session-plan/SKILL.md`
Slash command: `/session-plan`

Session planning protocol that transforms tactical-level understanding into an operational execution buffer of atomic issues with explicit dependencies, acceptance criteria, and Cynefin classification.
This skill operates at the tactical-to-operational planning horizon, decomposing scope into an implementation buffer at high resolution.

This is the default planning command for repositories with the full stigmergic workflow installed.
For repositories without the full workflow (no session-layer skills, small utility repos, quick fixes), use `/issues-beads-seed` and `/issues-beads-evolve` directly.

## Theoretical grounding

This skill is one component of a lifecycle that co-optimizes planning time against execution time.
The underlying model: planning depth has an optimal finite value where marginal yield from one additional planned step equals marginal accuracy loss and planning cost.
This optimum *decreases* as agent execution capacity increases — more agents demand shallower, faster planning cycles to avoid starving them on stale plans.
Model Predictive Control provides the structural answer: plan over a finite prediction horizon, commit only to a shorter control horizon of items dispatched to agents, then re-observe actual codebase state and replan from scratch.
Cynefin domain classification makes planning depth per-item rather than global: clear-domain work (known patterns) is planned far ahead at low cost, while complex-domain work (emergent behavior) is planned only as probes whose outcomes inform the next cycle.
The Viable System Model maps this to an organizational lifecycle where each session skill implements a specific regulatory function: System 4 (orient), System 3 (plan), System 1 (implement), System 3* (review), System 5 (checkpoint).
Stigmergic coordination binds it together — agents orient by reading structured signal tables on the issue DAG rather than receiving centralized briefings, achieving near-optimal throughput via local sensing and acting.
Queue economics calibrates the pipeline: buffer sizing via Little's Law, agent utilization at 70-85% (not 100%, due to queueing instability), and batch sizing via the U-curve between planning overhead and plan staleness.

This skill implements System 3: operational control and resource allocation.
It transforms tactical understanding into an executable DAG of atomic issues, sized by the buffer formula B* = (k/p)(1 + CV_p) to absorb planning variability without starving agents or accumulating stale inventory.
Cynefin classification drives decomposition granularity: clear-domain items decompose fully, complex-domain items decompose only into time-boxed probes.
The operational buffer is the MPC control horizon — the set of items committed for execution before the next replanning cycle.

This skill operates under the reflexive severity mandate: when patterns suggest the framework itself is producing poor outcomes, the agent's obligation is to pause and surface the observation rather than pressing on.
See the double-loop learning triggers in `preferences-validation-assurance` and the reflexive severity framework in `preferences-adaptive-planning`.

For the full theoretical derivation including the R_plan(d) formulation, buffer sizing heuristic, and validation gate placement theory, see `preferences-adaptive-planning`.

## Composed skills

This skill orchestrates a higher-level protocol that uses the following skills as components.
Do not duplicate their functionality; delegate to them.

- `/issues-beads-seed` creates an issue graph from architecture and specification documents.
  Delegate to this skill for new issue creation from `docs/development/` artifacts.
- `/issues-beads-evolve` refines issue graph structure.
  Delegate to this skill for restructuring existing graph topology (splitting, merging, re-parenting, dependency rewiring).
- `/stigmergic-convention` provides the signal table schema, field definitions, and read-modify-write protocol for writing signal tables on new and updated issues.

Load `/issues-beads-prime` for core beads conventions and command quick reference before running planning commands.

## Protocol

Execute the following steps in order.

### Step 1: AMDiRE readiness gate

Before any planning activity, validate that the `docs/development/` AMDiRE artifacts are sufficient to generate well-formed issues.
This gate enforces the contract that only tactical-resolution specifications in `docs/development/` serve as planning input.
The gate is a pure read operation: it examines filesystem state and produces a structured result without modifying any files.

The gate's stringency modulates by Cynefin domain.
Clear-domain work requires rigorous specifications because it is fully analyzable from documents.
Complex-domain work accepts less-formal specifications because it is emergent; the gate generates probe-oriented issues rather than implementation-detailed ones.

#### Required artifacts

Two AMDiRE categories must have substantive content for planning to proceed.

`docs/development/context/` must contain at least one document beyond `index.md`.
Context provides the problem domain understanding from which planning derives Cynefin classification, scope boundaries, and the rationale for why work items exist.
Without context, issues cannot be classified by domain and the resulting graph lacks information for planning-depth modulation.

`docs/development/architecture/` must contain at least one document beyond `index.md`.
Architecture provides the component decomposition and interface contracts from which planning derives epic boundaries, story breakdowns, and dependency relationships.
Without architecture, there is no structural basis for the issue graph.

#### Strengthening artifacts

Two additional AMDiRE categories improve planning output quality when present but do not block planning.

`docs/development/requirements/` enables attaching acceptance criteria and verification commands to issues.
When absent, planning generates issues with descriptive acceptance criteria inferred from architecture and emits a warning that acceptance criteria lack verification commands.

`docs/development/traceability/` enables validating that the issue graph covers all specified requirements.
When absent, planning cannot perform coverage analysis and emits a warning that completeness is unverifiable.

`docs/development/work-items/` is not an input to planning.
It is the output location for tracking implementation progress after seeding and is not checked by the gate.

#### Content quality checks

Presence alone is insufficient.
The gate examines content within required directories for the information planning consumes.

*Context quality criteria* require three elements.
First, a problem domain description: prose explaining what the system operates within, what constraints exist, and what objectives the work serves.
Planning uses this to generate issue descriptions that explain why each work item matters.
Second, a Cynefin domain classification: explicit classification of major components or subsystems as clear, complicated, complex, or chaotic.
This may appear as frontmatter (`cynefin: complicated`), as inline classification within the document, or as a dedicated section mapping components to domains.
Detection checks three locations in order: YAML frontmatter (`cynefin:` field), a dedicated section heading containing "cynefin" or "domain classification," and inline prose containing classification language; the first match wins.
Third, scope boundaries: explicit statement of what is in scope and out of scope for the current planning horizon.

When context lacks Cynefin classification, the gate defaults all components to the complicated domain and emits a warning stating which components lack classification and what default was applied.
Complicated is the safest default: it requires analysis but not probing, producing reasonably detailed plans without the rigidity of clear-domain specifications.

*Architecture quality criteria* require two elements.
First, a component decomposition: identification of major subsystems, modules, or services that constitute the solution, each described with enough specificity to derive an epic boundary.
A list of component names without descriptions is insufficient; planning needs to understand what each component does to generate meaningful story descriptions.
Second, dependency relationships: explicit identification of which components depend on which.
When dependencies are absent, planning can only generate a flat graph of independent epics, which is structurally valid but loses critical-path information.
Interface contracts between components are beneficial but not required.
When present, planning uses them to generate integration stories at component boundaries.
When absent, planning generates placeholder integration stories with acceptance criteria requiring interface definition during implementation.

*Requirements quality criteria* (when present) check for acceptance criteria (testable conditions defining when a requirement is satisfied) and verification commands (concrete commands or procedures for testing, e.g., `cargo test --features auth`, `curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq .status`).
When verification commands are present, planning attaches them to issues.
When absent, issues receive acceptance criteria without verification commands and a warning is emitted.

#### Blocking versus warning classification

The gate classifies deficiencies using expected rework cost as the decision criterion.
A blocking deficiency produces an issue graph requiring fundamental restructuring; a warning deficiency produces a valid but degraded graph that can be incrementally refined via `/issues-beads-evolve`.

*Blocking deficiencies* (halt planning):
- `docs/development/context/` does not exist or contains only `index.md`.
- `docs/development/architecture/` does not exist or contains only `index.md`.
- Architecture specification contains no identifiable component decomposition (a document exists but describes high-level vision without naming discrete components).

When a blocking deficiency is detected, emit the diagnostic, cite the documentation promotion workflow as the remediation path, and refuse to proceed.

*Warning deficiencies* (allow planning with degraded output):
- Context lacks Cynefin classification (severity: low). Default to complicated.
- Context lacks explicit scope boundaries (severity: moderate). Plan for all identified components.
- Architecture lacks dependency relationships (severity: moderate). Generate independent epics.
- Architecture lacks interface contracts (severity: low). Generate integration placeholders.
- Requirements directory absent (severity: moderate). Infer acceptance criteria from architecture.
- Requirements lack verification commands (severity: low). Omit verification commands.
- Traceability directory absent (severity: low). Skip coverage analysis.

Each warning includes severity and recommended remediation.
Warnings are collected and presented as a summary before planning proceeds.

#### Signal derivation

The gate derives two planning parameters from the context specification that control how issues are generated.

*Cynefin classification* propagates from context to generated issues and determines issue shape.
For clear-domain components: detailed step-by-step acceptance criteria, specific file paths, concrete verification commands; issues designed for execution without interpretation.
For complicated-domain components: analytical acceptance criteria describing expected outcome and analysis approach, leaving implementation details to the worker; verification commands included.
For complex-domain components: probe-oriented issues describing what uncertainty to resolve rather than what to build, including sense-making checkpoints and time-boxed exploration; acceptance criteria is "documented findings that inform next steps."
For chaotic-domain components: no issues generated; the gate emits a warning that chaotic-classified components are excluded from seeding and should be addressed through act-sense-respond cycles first.

*Planning depth* derives from Cynefin classification.
Clear-domain components decompose to fine granularity (epics, stories, tasks).
Complicated-domain components decompose to medium granularity (epics and stories, no tasks).
Complex-domain components decompose to coarse granularity (epics with probe stories only; further decomposition after probe completion via `/issues-beads-evolve`).

#### Diagnostic output template

The gate produces output in the following structure.
Render pass, blocked, or pass-with-warnings as appropriate.

```
Readiness gate: {PASS | BLOCKED | PASS with warnings}

Required artifacts:
  [{pass|blocked}] docs/development/context/ — {N documents found | not found | index.md only}
  [{pass|blocked}] docs/development/architecture/ — {N documents found | not found | index.md only}

Strengthening artifacts:
  [{pass|absent}] docs/development/requirements/ — {N documents found | not found}
  [{pass|absent}] docs/development/traceability/ — {N documents found | not found}

Content quality:
  [{pass|blocked|warn}] Context: problem domain description
  [{pass|warn}] Context: Cynefin classification {: domain | (default: complicated)}
  [{pass|warn}] Context: scope boundaries
  [{pass|blocked}] Architecture: component decomposition {: N components}
  [{pass|warn}] Architecture: dependency relationships
  [{pass|warn}] Architecture: interface contracts

{Only when requirements/ present:}
  [{pass|warn}] Requirements: acceptance criteria
  [{pass|warn}] Requirements: verification commands

{Only when warnings exist:}
Warnings from absent strengthening directories:
  [warn] {directory} absent (severity: {low|moderate})
    {Remediation guidance}

Derived parameters:
  Cynefin classification: {domain} ({scope note})
  Planning depth: {shallow|medium|deep} ({decomposition description})

{When blocked:}
Planning cannot proceed. Address blocking deficiencies by promoting
working notes from docs/notes/ to docs/development/ following the
documentation promotion workflow specification.

{When warnings exist:}
{N} warnings found. Proceed with degraded output, or address warnings
first? [proceed/address]
```

#### Invocation modes

The gate supports two modes.
Since this skill is a prompt template read by an AI agent rather than a CLI tool, the mode distinction is expressed as a conditional instruction activated by a parameter in the invocation prompt.

*Interactive mode* (default): present findings (blockers, warnings, derived parameters) and wait for user confirmation before proceeding.
This is appropriate when a human is coordinating the planning session.

*Automated mode* (activated by "mode: automated" in the prompt context): halt on blockers, proceed through warnings without prompting, and log the full diagnostic.
This is appropriate when planning is invoked programmatically by an orchestrator agent.

#### Incremental scoping

The seed skill recommends seeding one epic at a time rather than creating the entire structure upfront.
The gate supports this by accepting a component filter parameter in the invocation prompt.
When a component filter is provided, content quality checks are restricted to sections of context, architecture, requirements, and traceability documents pertaining to the named component.
Artifact presence checks still apply to the top-level required directories.
If component-scoped evaluation is not feasible (e.g., monolithic documents without per-component sections), treat the gate as evaluating readiness for the full planning pass and rely on incremental seeding to determine which epics to create from validated input.

### Step 2: docs-to-issues alignment verification

Before decomposing scope into new issues, verify that existing documentation and issues are aligned.

#### Existing issues audit

For each open issue, check whether its source spec (the document it was seeded from, if identifiable from description cross-references) has been modified since the issue was created.
If so, flag the issue for review: it may need updating to match the revised spec.

```bash
# Check modification dates of specs referenced in open issues
bd list --status open --json | jq -r '.[].description' | rg -o 'docs/development/[^ )]+' | sort -u
```

#### Coverage gaps

Identify specs in `docs/development/` that have no corresponding open or closed beads issues.
This is a planning gap: the spec exists but no work was planned from it.
Conversely, identify open issues whose descriptions reference docs that no longer exist (orphaned reference).

#### Audit remediation intake

Check active epic notes for `<!-- audit-findings -->` blocks produced by `/issues-beads-audit`.
When present, the audit has already applied mechanical fixes (signal table backfill, structural repairs) and produced a list of content remediation items that require planning judgment.

```bash
# Check for audit findings in active epic notes
bd show <epic-id> --json | jq -r '.[0].notes // ""' | grep -q 'audit-findings'
```

Treat each item in the "Content remediation needed" section as planning scope alongside new work from docs.
Acceptance criteria rewrites and scope updates go through `/issues-beads-evolve` in step 4.
Missing regression-protection issues become new issues created via `/issues-beads-seed` in step 4.
Confidence gaps on closed work are routed to `/session-review` rather than handled during planning.

After consuming the audit findings, clear the `<!-- audit-findings -->` block from the epic notes to prevent re-processing in future planning sessions.
Record what was consumed in the planning session's handoff narrative so the audit trail is preserved.

#### Buffer hygiene

Before creating new working notes, check the count of existing notes in `docs/notes/`.
If a subdirectory has 8+ files, suggest consolidation before adding more.
This prevents docs proliferation.

```bash
# Count files per notes subdirectory
fd -e md . docs/notes/ -x echo {//} | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

#### Issue placement rules

When creating issues, determine whether each issue belongs in the planning repo or the project repo based on the nature of the deliverable, not which files are edited.

Planning repo issues: methodology decisions, cross-project coordination, shared conventions, strategic scope changes, ecosystem-level architecture decisions, orchestration-level sequencing.

Project repo issues: implementation deliverables, project-specific architecture, project-scoped bugs and features, per-project CI/CD configuration, convention implementation into tooling.

When uncertain, prefer the project repo.
Planning issues should be the minority: they define *what* the convention is, while project repos define *how* it is realized.

#### Paired epic pattern

When work spans both planning and project scope, evaluate whether paired epics are warranted.
Create paired epics (one in each repo) when all three conditions hold:

1. The work requires both a specification (what to build) and an implementation (building it).
2. The specification applies beyond the implementing project.
3. The implementation is substantial enough to warrant its own epic rather than a single issue.

Cross-reference paired epics in their descriptions using the format `see {prefix}-{id} in {repo}`.
When only conditions 1 and 2 hold but the implementation is small, create a single planning epic with a child issue that references the project repo.

### Step 3: assess current operational buffer

Count ready, unblocked issues in the current scope.

```bash
bd status
bd blocked
bd ready
```

Dependency chains for specific issues can be examined with `bd dep tree <id> --direction both` to understand what work is sequentially constrained versus independently actionable.

Compare the ready count against the buffer sizing heuristic to determine whether planning is warranted.

#### Buffer sizing heuristic

The target buffer size is:

```
B* = (k / p) * (1 + CV_p)
```

where:
- *k* is agent throughput: issues completed per unit time (estimated from recent completion rate).
- *p* is planning rate: issues planned per unit time (estimated from recent planning sessions).
- *CV_p* is the planning variability coefficient: standard deviation of planning rate divided by its mean.

Interpretation:
- If the ready (unblocked) issue count is below B*, the buffer is depleted and deeper planning is warranted.
  Proceed through the remaining steps.
- If the ready count meets or exceeds B*, planning capacity should shift to implementation.
  Report the buffer status and recommend proceeding to implementation rather than further planning.

The formula captures the insight that the operational buffer should be large enough to absorb variability in planning throughput.
When planning is highly variable (high CV_p), a larger buffer prevents implementation stalls.
When planning is consistent (low CV_p), a smaller buffer suffices.

In practice, estimate k from `bd list --status closed --closed-after <date> --all` (recent closures per session), estimate p from the number of issues created in recent planning sessions, and estimate CV_p conservatively at 0.5 if insufficient data exists.
As the project accumulates history, refine these estimates.

### Step 4: decompose scope into atomic issues

Each issue must have:
- A description sufficient for a worker to self-direct without additional context beyond what the issue and its dependency closure context provide.
- Acceptance criteria with at least one executable verification command when the requirements specification provides them, or descriptive acceptance criteria when it does not.
- A Cynefin classification based on the knowability of cause-effect relationships for that specific work item.
- A confidence target indicating what evidence level the issue should achieve: `finding-recorded` for probes, `locally-verified` for implementation issues, `integration-verified` for convergence issues, `validated` for milestone issues, `regression-protected` for operational issues. The target is derived from the issue's role in the DAG, not assigned independently.

Delegate issue creation to `/issues-beads-seed` for new issues derived from `docs/development/` artifacts.
When restructuring existing issues (splitting, re-scoping, re-parenting), delegate to `/issues-beads-evolve`.

Cynefin modulates decomposition granularity:
- *Clear* domain: light decomposition; issues are already obvious from the specification.
- *Complicated* domain: standard decomposition following the R_plan(d) model.
- *Complex* domain: iterative decomposition producing probe-based experiments as issues.
- *Chaotic* domain: minimal decomposition; stabilize first, plan later.

When the scope is substantial enough that implementation alone would not establish confidence, decompose the evidence-producing work explicitly alongside the implementation work.
An implementation issue creates the behavior, a sibling or downstream validation issue challenges the higher-level claim with severe tests, and a regression-protection issue makes the validated claim durable through automated or runtime guards.
This decomposition is not mandatory for every issue — clear-domain work with straightforward acceptance criteria may achieve `locally-verified` or higher through its own acceptance tests.
Apply it when the gap between "code exists" and "we have confidence" is large enough to warrant separate tracking.

### Step 5: wire dependencies

Use parent-child relationships for containment (epic contains tasks) and blocks relationships for sequencing (task A must complete before task B can begin).
The dependency graph must be acyclic.

Delegate dependency wiring to `/issues-beads-seed` during initial creation (via `--parent` and `--deps` flags) and to `/issues-beads-evolve` for restructuring existing dependencies.

Refer to the containment-versus-sequencing discipline documented in `/issues-beads-seed` and the "Dependency type discipline" convention in `/issues-beads-prime` to avoid the common structural error of expressing containment as sequencing.

### Step 6: set signal tables on new issues

Each new issue receives a signal table following the schema from `/stigmergic-convention`.

```
<!-- stigmergic-signals -->
| Signal | Value | Updated |
|---|---|---|
| schema-version | 1 | YYYY-MM-DD |
| cynefin | {derived from step 1 gate or explicit classification} | YYYY-MM-DD |
| surprise | 0.0 | YYYY-MM-DD |
| progress | not-started | YYYY-MM-DD |
| escalation | none | -- |
| planning-depth | {derived from cynefin, or explicitly overridden} | YYYY-MM-DD |
<!-- /stigmergic-signals -->
```

Each new issue also receives confidence signals in the same signal table.
Set `confidence` to `undemonstrated`, `evidence-freshness` to `—`, and `regression-guard` to `none`.
These are starting values — promotion happens when evidence is produced during implementation and review, not during planning.
The confidence target from step 4 is not recorded in the signal table (it would duplicate what the issue's role in the DAG already expresses); it serves as planning guidance for the worker who implements the issue.

Write signal tables using the read-modify-write protocol from `/stigmergic-convention`.
The cynefin and planning-depth values come from the readiness gate's signal derivation (step 1) or from explicit per-issue classification during decomposition (step 4).

### Step 7: verify graph health

After all issues are created and wired, verify structural integrity.

```bash
# Cycle detection — must be zero
bd dep cycles

# Structural lint
bd lint

# Parent-child integrity — every epic should show non-zero children
bd epic status

# Tree view for visual verification
bd list --pretty
```

Perform critical path analysis to identify the longest dependency chain.
This determines which issues, if delayed, extend the total completion time.

```bash
# Dependency graph for each new epic
bd dep tree <epic-id> --direction both
```

If cycles are detected, resolve them before proceeding.
If lint warnings appear, address structural issues.
These checks are performed inline rather than delegating to `/issues-beads-audit` because they are a single step within the planning protocol rather than a standalone maintenance activity.

### Step 8: produce dependency-ordered execution plan

List issues in an order that respects dependency constraints.
Highlight the critical path: the longest chain of sequential dependencies determining minimum total completion time.
Identify which issues can be worked in parallel at each stage of the execution order.

The execution plan serves as the handoff to implementation.
A worker reading this plan should understand what to work on first, what can proceed concurrently, and where the bottlenecks are.

```bash
# Identify all unblocked work as parallel execution candidates
bd ready

# Examine dependency chains per epic to identify sequential constraints
bd dep tree <epic-id> --direction both

# Full graph for visual verification of execution order
bd list --pretty
```

## Replanning triggers

Four conditions trigger re-invocation of `/session-plan` to restock the operational buffer.

*Surprise accumulation exceeds replanning threshold.*
The `/session-checkpoint` skill detects this condition by computing the sum of surprise scores across session nodes and comparing against threshold theta.
When surprise is high, the existing plan has diverged from reality and requires revision.

*Validation gate completion.*
When `/session-review` completes integration verification at a DAG convergence point, findings may invalidate planning assumptions.
The worker detects this condition and invokes `/session-plan` if the review reveals structural issues.

*Specification change.*
When architecture or requirements documents are revised, the planning assumptions that produced the current buffer may be stale.
The worker detects this condition and invokes `/session-plan` to reconcile the buffer with the updated specifications.

*Buffer depletion.*
When the ready issue count drops below B*, the buffer can no longer sustain continuous implementation.
The `/session-checkpoint` skill detects this condition via buffer depletion alerts in the handoff narrative.

In all cases, begin with step 1 (readiness gate) to validate that the input artifacts remain sufficient, then proceed through the remaining steps to restock the buffer.

## Cynefin modulation within planning

Cynefin classification modulates how deeply this skill executes, not whether the worker enters the planning phase.

| Cynefin domain | Planning behavior |
|---|---|
| Clear | Light: issues are already obvious from the specification. Minimal decomposition, direct acceptance criteria. |
| Complicated | Standard: full R_plan(d) decomposition with buffer sizing, analytical acceptance criteria. |
| Complex | Iterative: probe-based experiments as issues. Each probe is time-boxed exploration with sense-making checkpoint. Further decomposition deferred until after probe completion. |
| Chaotic | Minimal: stabilize first, plan later. Only act-sense-respond issues are created. Long-term planning explicitly deferred. |

## Typical next steps

After planning completes, the worker proceeds to one of:

- Implementation if the operational buffer is now full and issues are ready with clear acceptance criteria and verification commands.
- `/session-orient` if scope changed during planning and re-calibration is needed before selecting work.
- Further `/session-plan` if the buffer is still depleted after the current planning pass (rare; usually indicates the scope is too large for a single planning session and should be narrowed).
