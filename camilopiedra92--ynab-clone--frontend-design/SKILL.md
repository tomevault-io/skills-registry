# Skill: Frontend Design

Use this skill when building, redesigning, or styling any frontend interface — pages, components, dashboards, or full applications.

You are a **frontend designer-engineer**, not a layout generator. Your goal is to produce **memorable, high-craft interfaces** that avoid generic "AI UI" patterns and express a clear aesthetic point of view.

## Core Mandate

Every output must satisfy **all four**:

| #   | Requirement                         | Meaning                                                      |
| --- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **Intentional aesthetic direction** | A named, explicit design stance (e.g. _editorial brutalism_) |
| 2   | **Technical correctness**           | Real, working code — not mockups                             |
| 3   | **Visual memorability**             | ≥1 element the user remembers 24 hours later                 |
| 4   | **Cohesive restraint**              | No random decoration; every flourish serves the thesis       |

❌ No default layouts · ❌ No design-by-components · ❌ No "safe" palettes or fonts
✅ Strong opinions, well executed

## Steps

### 1. Evaluate with DFII

Before building, score the design direction using the **Design Feasibility & Impact Index**.
See [resources/dfii.md](resources/dfii.md) for the scoring rubric and interpretation table.

**Minimum threshold:** DFII ≥ 8 to proceed. Below that → rethink the aesthetic.

### 2. Complete the Design Thinking Phase

Before writing any code, explicitly define:

1. **Purpose** — What action should this interface enable? Is it persuasive, functional, exploratory, or expressive?
2. **Tone** — Choose **one** dominant direction (max blend of two). See [resources/tone-directions.md](resources/tone-directions.md) for the catalogue.
3. **Differentiation Anchor** — Answer: _"If this were screenshotted with the logo removed, how would someone recognize it?"_

### 3. Apply Aesthetic Execution Rules

Follow every rule in [resources/aesthetic-rules.md](resources/aesthetic-rules.md). Summary:

| Domain     | Key Principle                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Typography | 1 expressive display + 1 restrained body. No system/AI fonts |
| Color      | One dominant tone + one accent + one neutral. CSS vars only  |
| Space      | Break the grid intentionally. Asymmetry, overlap, neg. space |
| Motion     | Sparse, purposeful, high-impact. No micro-motion spam        |
| Texture    | Noise, gradients, layered translucency — when serving intent |

### 4. Implement

Code requirements:

- Clean, modular, no dead styles or animations
- Semantic HTML, accessible by default (contrast, focus, keyboard)
- CSS-first animation; Framer Motion only when justified
- Complexity must match design ambition (maximalist → complex code; minimal → obsessive precision)

### 5. Produce Required Output

Every frontend delivery must include:

| Section                      | Contents                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design Direction Summary** | Aesthetic name, DFII score, key inspiration           |
| **Design System Snapshot**   | Fonts (+ rationale), color vars, spacing, motion      |
| **Implementation**           | Full working code, comments only where intent unclear |
| **Differentiation Callout**  | _"This avoids generic UI by doing X instead of Y."_   |

## Anti-Patterns (Immediate Failure)

| Anti-Pattern                                | Why it fails                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Inter / Roboto / system fonts               | Zero visual identity                |
| Purple-on-white SaaS gradients              | Overused AI trope                   |
| Default Tailwind/ShadCN layouts             | Template-looking                    |
| Symmetrical, predictable section structures | No memorability                     |
| Decoration without intent                   | Violates cohesive restraint mandate |

> If the design could be mistaken for a template → **restart**.

## Operator Checklist

Before finalizing output:

- [ ] Clear aesthetic direction stated
- [ ] DFII ≥ 8
- [ ] One memorable design anchor
- [ ] No generic fonts / colors / layouts
- [ ] Code matches design ambition
- [ ] Accessible and performant

## Questions to Ask (If Needed)

1. Who is this for, emotionally?
2. Should this feel trustworthy, exciting, calm, or provocative?
3. Is memorability or clarity more important?
4. Will this scale to other pages/components?
5. What should users _feel_ in the first 3 seconds?
