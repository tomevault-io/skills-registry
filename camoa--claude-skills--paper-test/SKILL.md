description: Use when testing code, skills, commands, or configs through mental execution — trace logic line-by-line with concrete values to find bugs, logic errors, edge cases, contract violations, and AI hallucinations. Use when user says "paper test", "trace this", "find bugs", "check for edge cases", "audit this code", "verify AI code", "test this skill", "validate this implementation", "review this logic", "check dependencies", "check this config". MUST verify external calls — never assume methods exist. Use proactively before deploying changes or after AI generates code.

# Paper Test

Systematically test code by mentally executing it line-by-line with concrete values.

## Routing — Choose the Right Approach

| Target Size | Approach | Why |
|-------------|----------|-----|
| **< 50 lines** | Quick trace (Steps 1–7 below) | Fast, inline, sufficient for small code |
| **50–300 lines** | Structured 3-phase (below) | One agent, all 3 perspectives, sequential — thorough without coordination overhead |
| **300+ lines or security-critical** | `/code-paper:test-team` (3 agents) | Context pressure justifies splitting. Cross-challenge debate catches what one agent misses. |
| **Skill/command/agent files** | `/code-paper:test-team` | Different lenses genuinely find different things for instruction-based testing |

If the user asks for "paper test" without specifying, read the target files, count lines, and recommend the appropriate approach. For 50–300 lines, use the Structured 3-Phase mode below. Only recommend `/test-team` for 300+ lines, explicit "test team" requests, or security-critical code.

## Structured 3-Phase Mode (50–300 lines)

Read `references/structured-3-phase.md` for the full methodology. It runs Phase A (happy path), Phase B (edge cases, 6 categories), Phase C (adversarial, 5 categories), and Phase D (self-review) sequentially in one agent.

---

## Quick Trace Mode (< 50 lines)

For small code, skip the structured phases. Just trace with concrete values.

## When to Use

- "Paper test this code" / "Trace this code" / "Test without running"
- "Find bugs in this code" / "Check for edge cases"
- "Validate this implementation" / "Review this logic"
- "Paper test this skill" / "Test this command" / "Validate this agent"
- "Check this config" / "Verify this YAML" / "Trace this prompt"
- Before deploying changes
- Debugging without a debugger
- Reviewing unfamiliar or AI-generated code
- Validating complex logic (loops, conditionals, recursion)
- Reviewing skills, commands, agents, or plugin configs

## Method

Follow code logic with concrete test cases to find:
1. **Potential issues** - Bugs, wrong assumptions, edge cases
2. **Missing code** - What's needed but not written to achieve intent

NOT just reading - actually run the code in your head with real values.

## Critical: How AI Should Verify

**NEVER assume or guess** - Use your tools to verify every claim:

### Verifying External Dependencies

When code calls external methods/services:

1. **Use Read tool** to check actual source files:
   ```
   Read: src/Service/UserService.php
   → Find loadByEmail() method
   → Note: Returns User|null, throws InvalidArgumentException if empty
   ```

2. **Use Grep tool** to find method definitions:
   ```
   Grep: "public function loadByEmail" in src/
   → Verify method exists and signature
   ```

3. **Check interfaces** for injected services:
   ```
   Read: vendor/.../LoggerInterface.php
   → Verify info() method signature
   ```

**DO NOT** write "Assume method exists" - Actually verify or mark as UNVERIFIED RISK.

### Verifying Code Contracts

When code has relationships (extends, implements, uses):

1. **Read parent/base classes**:
   ```
   Read: src/Plugin/ActionBase.php
   → Check for abstract methods
   → Verify parent constructor signature
   ```

2. **Read interfaces**:
   ```
   Read: src/Handler/HandlerInterface.php
   → List all required methods
   → Note exact signatures
   ```

3. **Check service definitions**:
   ```
   Read: config/services.yml
   Read: modulename.services.yml
   → Verify service ID exists
   → Check tags if using service collectors
   ```

### When You Cannot Verify

If source is unavailable (external package, closed-source):

```
DEPENDENCY CHECK: $externalApi->fetchData()
  VERIFICATION: Unable to read source
  RISK: Cannot verify method exists or return type
  RECOMMENDATION: Add runtime checks for null/exceptions
```

Mark as risk - don't assume it works.

### Verifying Configuration Dependencies

When code reads config values (YAML, JSON, .env, services):

1. **Find the config source** — Read the actual file
2. **Verify key exists** — Does the key the code reads actually exist?
3. **Verify value type** — Does the value match what code expects?
4. **Verify defaults** — If config missing, is there a sensible fallback?

```
CONFIG CHECK: $this->config('my_module.settings')->get('api_timeout')
  Source: config/install/my_module.settings.yml
  Key exists?  YES / NO
  Value:       30
  Type match:  integer (code expects int) — MATCH / MISMATCH
  Default:     NULL if missing — RISK: no fallback
```

Also check: services.yml (service IDs, arguments), routing.yml (route names), schema.yml (structure matches config).

## Quick Reference

| Test Type | When | Output |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Happy Path | First test | Verify correct flow |
| Edge Cases | After happy path | Find boundary issues |
| Error Cases | Last | Verify error handling |
| Contract Verification | Always | Check dependencies |

---

## Paper Testing Workflow

When user provides code to test:

### Step 1: Define Test Scenarios

Pick concrete input values. Start with happy path, then edge cases.

```
SCENARIO: [Description of what we're testing]
INPUT:
  $variable1 = [concrete value]
  $variable2 = [concrete value]
  [initial state]
```

### Step 2: Trace Line by Line

Follow each line. Write the variable state after execution.

```
Line [N]: [code statement]
         → [variable] = [new value]
         → [state change description]
```

### Step 2b: Track Data Flow Across Boundaries

At every function call, method return, or data handoff, track type transformations:

```
DATA FLOW: [source] → [destination]
  Input type:  [what was passed]
  Output type: [what was returned]
  Coercion:    [any implicit type change]
  Risk:        [what breaks if type is wrong]
```

Watch for:
- **Implicit coercion** — string "30" used as int, null used as empty string
- **Container types** — method returns array but code treats as single object
- **Serialization boundaries** — object → JSON → object (properties may change case, nulls may disappear)
- **Framework wrapping** — raw value wrapped in Response, FieldItemList, Result objects

### Step 3: Follow Every Branch

At each conditional, note which branch is taken and why.

```
Line [N]: if ([condition])
         → [variable1]=[value], [variable2]=[value]
         → [evaluation] = [true/false]
         → TAKES: [if branch / else branch] (lines X-Y)
```

### Step 4: Track Loop Iterations

For loops, trace EACH iteration with index and values.

```
Line [N]: foreach ([collection] as [item])

Iteration 1: $key=[value], $item=[value]
  Line [N+1]: [statement]
           → [state change]

Iteration 2: $key=[value], $item=[value]
  Line [N+1]: [statement]
           → [state change]

Loop ends. Final state: [describe]
```

### Step 5: Verify External Dependencies

For EVERY external call (methods, services, APIs), verify:

```
DEPENDENCY CHECK: [service/method name]

Location: [file path or interface]
Method signature: [actual signature]
Returns: [actual return type and values]
Throws: [exceptions, when]
Side effects: [what it modifies]

VERIFICATION:
  - [ ] Method exists
  - [ ] Parameters correct (type, order)
  - [ ] Return type handled correctly
  - [ ] Edge cases considered
```

**DO NOT ASSUME** - Read the actual source code or documentation.

### Step 6: Verify Code Contracts

For classes with relationships (extends, implements, uses, injects):

```
CONTRACT VERIFICATION: [Class name]

Extends: [Parent class]
  - [ ] All abstract methods implemented
  - [ ] Parent constructor called (if required)
  - [ ] Parent methods called when needed

Implements: [Interface]
  - [ ] All interface methods present
  - [ ] Signatures match exactly
  - [ ] Return types correct

Injected Services:
  - [ ] Service exists in container
  - [ ] Interface methods verified
  - [ ] Return types handled

Tagged Service (if applicable):
  - [ ] Tag name matches collector
  - [ ] Implements required interface
  - [ ] Priority appropriate
```

See reference guide for complete contract patterns.

### Step 7: Note Output and Flaws

```
OUTPUT:
  Return value: [what's returned]
  Side effects: [database changes, API calls, etc.]
  State changes: [session, cache, variables]

FLAWS FOUND:
  - Line [N]: [description of issue]
    FIX: [how to resolve]
  - Line [N]: [description of issue]
    FIX: [how to resolve]
```

### Step 8: Untested Path Analysis

After all scenarios, review for paths NOT exercised:

```
UNTESTED PATHS:
  - Line [N]-[M]: [else branch / catch block / default case] — never triggered
    Risk: [what this path handles]
    Scenario needed: [input that would trigger it]

Coverage: [X of Y branches exercised]
Recommendation: [add scenario for critical untested paths / accept risk]
```

## What to Look For

### Logic Errors
- Wrong comparison (`=` vs `==` vs `===`)
- Inverted condition (`if ($x)` should be `if (!$x)`)
- Off-by-one in loops
- Missing break in switch

### Null/Undefined Access
- Accessing property on null object
- Array key that might not exist
- Uninitialized variable

### Edge Cases
- Empty array/string
- Zero, negative numbers
- Null values
- Very large inputs

### State Issues
- Variable modified but not used
- Variable used before assignment
- Stale data from previous iteration

### Flow Issues
- Unreachable code
- Missing return statement
- Early return skips cleanup

### Error Propagation
- Exception thrown but caught too high (wrong handler)
- Exception swallowed silently (empty catch block)
- Partial state left behind (DB row inserted, email not sent)
- Wrong error code/status returned to caller
- User retries after error — causes duplicates?

### Performance Patterns
- N+1 query — database call inside a loop
- Nested loops on collections — O(n²) or worse
- Same expensive call repeated — missing cache/variable
- Unbounded collection growth — no size limit in loop
- Missing pagination — loads entire table into memory

### AI Code Issues
- Invented methods that don't exist
- Wrong return types assumed
- Wrong parameter order
- Mixed API versions
- Assumed service existence
- Wrong namespace imports

## Testing Strategy for Modules

For modules with multiple components (ECA plugins, form systems, etc.), use coverage-driven hybrid approach.

### Two Levels

**Flow-based**: Real user workflows end-to-end
- Tests integration and data handoffs
- Catches format mismatches, token issues

**Component**: Each component with edge cases
- Tests individual logic thoroughly
- Catches implementation bugs, null handling

### Coverage Method

```
Step 1: Map all components
  - List every event, condition, action, service

Step 2: Design flows covering all components
  - Each component in at least one flow
  - 3-5 flows typically cover a module

Step 3: Add component edge cases
  - For each component: scenarios NOT in flows
  - Error cases, empty inputs, boundaries
  - 2-4 edge cases per component
```

---

## Output Format

Use this template for all paper tests:

```
PAPER TEST: [File/Function name]

SCENARIO: [Description]
INPUT:
  [variable] = [value]
  [variable] = [value]

TRACE:
Line [N]: [code]
         → [variable] = [new value]

Line [N]: [conditional]
         → [evaluation] = [result]
         → TAKES: [branch]

Line [N]: [loop start]
Iteration [N]: [values]
  Line [N]: [code]
           → [state]

OUTPUT:
  Return: [value]
  Side effects: [list]
  State changes: [list]

DEPENDENCY CHECKS:
  [method/service]: VERIFIED / ISSUE FOUND
    Issue: [description]

CONTRACT CHECKS:
  [pattern]: VERIFIED / VIOLATION
    Issue: [description]

FLAWS FOUND:
  - [Line N]: [issue]
    FIX: [solution]
  - [Line N]: [issue]
    FIX: [solution]

EDGE CASES TO TEST:
  1. [scenario]
  2. [scenario]
```
