# Task Context Loader

Load all context needed before implementing a task.

## Active Tasks
!`ls implementation_process/in_progress/ 2>/dev/null`

## Activation

Activate when you detect:
- `/drupal-dev-framework:implement <task>` command
- "Work on X task" or "Implement X"
- "Start coding X"
- Beginning a coding session for a component

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Project and Task

Get project path from `project_state.md`. Find the task:

**v3.0.0 Folder Structure:**
- Check `implementation_process/in_progress/{task}/` for task directory
- If directory exists, verify `task.md` file exists

**v2.x Single File (backward compatibility):**
- Check `implementation_process/in_progress/{task}.md` for single file

If neither exists, offer to create one using the Skill tool to invoke `implementation-task-creator` (it is a skill, not an agent)

### 2. Load Architecture

Use `Read` tool to load:
```
{project_path}/architecture/main.md
{project_path}/architecture/{component}.md (if exists)
```

Extract from architecture:
- Component purpose
- Dependencies
- Pattern references

### 3. Load Task Files

**v3.0.0 Folder Structure:**

Load all relevant phase files:

1. **Load task.md** (tracker):
   ```
   Use `Read` on `{task}/task.md`
   ```
   Extract:
   - Goal
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Current phase status
   - Related tasks

2. **Load research.md** (if exists):
   ```
   Use `Read` on `{task}/research.md`
   ```
   Context from Phase 1 research

3. **Load architecture.md** (if exists):
   ```
   Use `Read` on `{task}/architecture.md`
   ```
   Extract:
   - Architecture design
   - Pattern decisions
   - Component specifications

4. **Load implementation.md** (if exists):
   ```
   Use `Read` on `{task}/implementation.md`
   ```
   Extract:
   - Progress notes
   - TDD steps
   - Files created/modified
   - Current status

**v2.x Single File (backward compatibility):**

Use `Read` on `{task}.md` and extract all sections

### 4. Load Pattern References

From architecture files, find pattern references like:
```
Based on: core/modules/.../src/...
```

Use `Read` to load the referenced core files. Extract:
- Key method signatures
- Dependency injection patterns
- Implementation approach

### 5. Check for Guides

If `project_state.md` has a guides path, invoke `guide-loader` skill for relevant guides.

### 6. Present Context Summary

Format output as:
```
## Ready to Implement: {Task Name}

### Objective
{from task file}

### Architecture Summary
{key points from architecture}

### Pattern Reference
{primary core file}:
- Key methods to follow: {list}
- Dependencies to inject: {list}

### TDD Approach
1. Test file: {path}
2. First test: {what to test}

### Files to Create/Modify
- {file 1}: {what to do}
- {file 2}: {what to do}

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {criterion 1}
- [ ] {criterion 2}

### Dependencies
Complete these first:
- {prerequisite task, if any}

---
Ready to write the first test?
```

### 7. Activate TDD Companion

After presenting context, remind:
```
TDD reminder: Write test first, then implement.
Use superpowers:test-driven-development for detailed TDD guidance.
```

## Stop Points

STOP and wait for user:
- If task file not found (offer to create)
- After presenting context summary
- If prerequisites are incomplete (ask how to proceed)
