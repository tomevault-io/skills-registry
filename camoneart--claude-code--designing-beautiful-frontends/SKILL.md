## Source and Attribution

This skill is based on the design philosophy from:
- [Improving frontend design through Skills](https://claude.com/blog/improving-frontend-design-through-skills) (Official Anthropic blog)
- [anthropics/skills/frontend-design](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) (Official Skills repository)

## Why AI-Generated UIs Look the Same

Language models suffer from **distributional convergence**: they default to patterns that dominate training data. Without intervention, Claude gravitates toward Inter/Roboto fonts, purple gradients on white backgrounds, predictable hero-features-CTA layouts, and minimal animations. The result is "AI slop" — interfaces that are technically correct but visually indistinguishable from each other.

This skill exists to break that pattern. Every design decision must be intentional and context-specific, not a safe default.

## Design Thinking Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Context

Before writing any CSS or markup, gather context about the project. If the user has already provided clear direction (aesthetic, brand, constraints), proceed directly. Otherwise, use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who is the audience?
- **Tone**: What feeling should it evoke? (e.g., playful, authoritative, warm, cutting-edge, luxurious, raw)
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements, browser support, performance budget, existing design system?
- **Differentiation**: What should make this UI memorable and distinct?

Example question structure:
```
Questions to ask:
1. "What aesthetic direction fits this project?" — Offer 3-4 *diverse* directions as examples (not a fixed list), tailored to the project context
2. "Are there reference sites or styles you admire?"
3. "Any technical constraints I should know about?"
```

### Step 2: Choose an Aesthetic Direction

**Do NOT pick from a fixed menu.** The space of possible aesthetics is infinite. Instead, think about extremes along multiple axes:

- **Density**: Sparse minimalism ... dense maximalism
- **Formality**: Corporate polish ... raw brutalism
- **Era**: Retro nostalgia ... bleeding-edge futurism
- **Warmth**: Cold geometric precision ... organic hand-crafted warmth
- **Color intensity**: Monochrome restraint ... chromatic explosion

Pick a strong position. **The middle is the worst place to be.** Bland, uncommitted design is the hallmark of AI slop.

When suggesting directions to the user, generate options that are **specific to their project context**, not recycled presets.

### Step 3: Implement with Full Commitment

Once a direction is chosen, commit fully. Every implementation detail — font choice, color, spacing, animation, texture — must reinforce the chosen aesthetic vision.

**Adjust implementation complexity to match the aesthetic vision.** A brutalist one-page site needs different techniques than a rich editorial experience. Do not over-engineer simple aesthetics or under-deliver complex ones.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography

#### Fonts to AVOID (convergence traps)
- Inter, Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, Open Sans, Lato, system-ui
- These are not bad fonts — they are overused defaults that signal "no design thought"

#### Font Selection Principles
- **Choose fonts that reinforce the aesthetic direction** — there is no universal "good" font list
- Every project should use different typography. If you used a font recently, pick a different one
- Pair fonts with extreme contrast: display + monospace, serif + geometric sans
- Weight contrast: 100/200 vs 800/900 (not 400 vs 600)
- Size jumps: 3x+ between hierarchy levels (not 1.5x)
- Use Google Fonts or Fontsource for access to distinctive typefaces

#### NEVER Converge on Familiar Alternatives
Even with instructions to avoid defaults, there is a tendency to fall back on the same "alternative" fonts repeatedly. **Do not always reach for the same replacements.** Vary deliberately every time.

### Color and Theme

#### Principles
- **Dominant color + sharp accent** outperforms timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Use CSS custom properties (`--color-*`) for systematic theming
- Draw inspiration from unexpected sources: IDE themes, cultural aesthetics, nature, architecture, film, fashion

#### Palette Construction Thinking
- Start from the aesthetic direction, not from a color picker
- Ask: "What colors would this aesthetic naturally live in?"
- Consider: What cultural or emotional associations do these colors carry?
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)

#### Combinations to AVOID
- Purple gradient + white background (generic SaaS)
- Blue + gray only (corporate template)
- Bootstrap/Material default colors
- Any palette you have used in a recent project

### Motion and Animation

#### Priority Order
1. **CSS-only animations** (performance first)
2. **Motion library** (for complex orchestration in React/Vue/JS)

#### High-Impact Moments
Focus animation budget on moments that matter most:
- Page load: staggered reveal animations (animation-delay)
- Hover: surprising micro-interactions
- Scroll-triggered transitions
- State changes and transitions

One well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions everywhere.

#### Always include `prefers-reduced-motion` media query handling.

### Spatial Composition

#### Layout Principles
- **Embrace unexpected layouts** — break the template
- Asymmetry, overlapping elements, diagonal flow
- Strategically place **grid-breaking elements**
- Generous negative space OR controlled density (pick one, commit)

#### Layout to AVOID
- Header → Hero → 3-column features → CTA → Footer (the template layout)
- Perfectly symmetrical, evenly-spaced card grids
- Any layout that looks like a Bootstrap/Tailwind template

### Backgrounds and Visual Details

Never use plain solid backgrounds as the default. Consider:
- Gradient meshes
- Noise textures / grain overlays
- Geometric patterns
- Layered transparency
- Dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders
- Custom cursors (where appropriate)

## Anti-Convergence Rules

These are the most critical rules in this skill:

1. **No two designs should look the same.** Every project gets a unique visual identity
2. **Use different fonts every time.** Never default to the same "safe alternative"
3. **Use different color palettes every time.** Never recycle a previous palette
4. **Vary layouts across projects.** If the last project used asymmetric grids, try something different
5. **Question every "default" choice.** If a decision feels automatic, it is probably convergent

### Self-Check During Implementation

Before finalizing any design, ask yourself:
- "Would a human designer make this exact same combination of choices?"
- "Could someone tell this was AI-generated by looking at it?"
- "Have I used any of these fonts/colors/patterns in a recent project?"
- "Is there anything surprising or distinctive about this design?"

If the answer to any of these raises concern, revise.

## Recommended Tech Stack

Default recommendations (confirm with user via `AskUserQuestion` if project setup is unclear):

- **React 19** + **TypeScript**
- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack, React Compiler)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** + **shadcn/ui**
- **Motion** (formerly Framer Motion, for animations)
- **Google Fonts** or **Fontsource**

If the user is working with an existing project, adapt to their stack. Do not assume or impose a stack without confirmation.

## Reference Files

Consult these when you need deeper guidance:

| File | When to read |
|------|-------------|
| [references/design-system-guide.md](references/design-system-guide.md) | When building a complete design system or need detailed typography/color/motion/spatial principles |
| [references/anti-convergence-patterns.md](references/anti-convergence-patterns.md) | When you catch yourself making "default" choices, or need thinking frameworks to break convergence |
| [references/implementation-checklist.md](references/implementation-checklist.md) | Before delivering any UI implementation — run through the quality checklist |

## The Most Important Principle

**Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Do not self-censor or play it safe.**

Bold maximalism and refined minimalism are both valid — what matters is **intentional execution with full commitment**, not intensity. Every design should be a deliberate creative statement, never a safe default.

**No two projects should ever look the same.**
