# Document Creation

Generate structured documents from conversations, summaries, and content in open formats.

## Core Capabilities

**Supported formats:**
- Markdown (.md) - Structured text with formatting
- PDF (.pdf) - Professional documents with optional visual polish
- Text (.txt) - Plain text for maximum compatibility

**Document types:**
- Conversation summaries - Extract and structure chat content
- Executive reports - Polished summaries for leadership
- Technical documentation - Structured reference materials
- Meeting notes - Organized action items and decisions
- Project briefs - Scoped overviews and requirements

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Document Type

Identify the document's purpose and audience:

**Executive/Client-facing:** Reports, presentations, proposals, executive summaries
→ Use design-assistant skill for visual polish

**Internal/Working:** Meeting notes, drafts, technical docs, quick summaries  
→ Create directly without design enhancement

**Triggers for design integration:**
- User explicitly requests "professional", "polished", or "presentation-ready"
- Document is labeled as executive summary, client report, or proposal
- Context suggests external audience

### 2. Extract and Structure Content

**From conversations:**
- Identify key points, decisions, and action items
- Remove conversational artifacts (greetings, clarifications)
- Organize chronologically or thematically
- Preserve important context and reasoning

**From summaries:**
- Condense while maintaining essential information
- Use clear hierarchical structure
- Highlight critical insights upfront
- Include relevant details without bloat

### 3. Apply Format-Specific Patterns

**Markdown:**
- Use headers (# ## ###) for hierarchy
- Bold for emphasis, italics for nuance
- Lists for structured information
- Code blocks for technical content
- Links for references

**PDF (without design skill):**
- Clean, readable typography
- Adequate whitespace
- Consistent formatting
- Professional but simple appearance

**PDF (with design-assistant):**
- Enhanced visual hierarchy
- Brand-appropriate styling
- Professional layout and graphics
- Executive-ready presentation

**Text:**
- Clear line breaks for readability
- Minimal formatting, maximum compatibility
- Section markers using caps or delimiters

### 4. Structure Guidelines

**Standard document structure:**

```
Title/Header
- Clear, descriptive

Executive Summary (if appropriate)
- 2-3 sentences maximum
- Key takeaway upfront

Body Content
- Logical sections with clear headers
- Scannable with visual hierarchy
- Bullet points for lists
- Paragraphs for detailed explanation

Conclusion/Next Steps (if appropriate)
- Action items
- Decisions required
- Follow-up needed
```

**For conversation summaries:**

```
Summary of [Topic/Meeting]
Date: [date]

Key Decisions:
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

Discussion Points:
- [Point 1]: [Brief explanation]
- [Point 2]: [Brief explanation]

Action Items:
- [ ] [Action item 1] - [Owner]
- [ ] [Action item 2] - [Owner]

Next Steps:
- [What happens next]
```

## Integration with Design Skill

When visual polish is needed:

1. Create the document content first (markdown or structured text)
2. Invoke design-assistant skill with content and context
3. Specify document type (report, brief, summary)
4. Let design skill handle visual formatting and PDF generation

**Don't trigger design skill when:**
- User requests a "quick summary" or "notes"
- Document is explicitly internal or draft
- User specifies "simple" or "basic" format
- Speed is prioritized over appearance

## Best Practices

**Clarity:**
- Lead with the most important information
- Use active voice
- Avoid jargon unless audience-appropriate
- Define acronyms on first use

**Scannability:**
- Break long paragraphs into shorter ones
- Use headers to create visual hierarchy
- Employ bullet points for lists
- Bold key terms sparingly

**Conciseness:**
- Remove redundant information
- Combine related points
- Eliminate filler words
- Respect the reader's time

**Accuracy:**
- Verify facts from conversation
- Maintain original meaning
- Note uncertainties or assumptions
- Date-stamp when relevant

## Output Location

Save documents to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` and provide computer:// links for user access.

## Example Triggers

- "Create a document summarizing our conversation"
- "Make a report about [topic]"
- "Export this to PDF"
- "Document this in markdown"
- "Generate meeting notes from this discussion"
- "Create an executive summary of our analysis"
- "I need this formatted as a professional report"
