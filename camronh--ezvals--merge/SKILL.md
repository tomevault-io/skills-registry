description: UAT a feature branch and merge it into dev. Use when: ready to merge a feature branch, want to verify changes before merging, or bringing worktree work into dev. Use when this capability is needed.

**Arguments:** The feature branch name to UAT and merge into dev.

Assumes tests already passed during `/prepare-merge`. No need to re-run pytest.

Follow these steps in order:

## 1. Handle Worktree (If Applicable)

Run `git worktree list` to check if the branch is checked out in a worktree.

If it is (e.g. at `~/.claude-worktrees/<repo>/<branch>`):
- Remove it: `git worktree remove <worktree-path>`
- The branch is now free to check out normally

## 2. Checkout and Rebase onto Dev

The feature branch may be out of date. Rebase onto dev first so UAT runs against the current state and the diff only reflects the feature's actual changes.

```bash
git checkout <branch>
git rebase dev
uv sync
```

If the rebase has conflicts, abort (`git rebase --abort`), report the conflicts, and STOP. The user resolves manually then re-runs `/merge`.

## 3. Analyze Branch Changes

- Run `git diff dev..<branch> --stat` to see changed files
- Run `git log dev..<branch> --oneline` to see commits
- Read key changed files to understand what was implemented
- Categorize changes:
  - **CLI**: `ezvals/cli.py`, `ezvals/runner.py`, `ezvals/discovery.py`, `ezvals/config.py`
  - **UI**: `ezvals/server/`, `ezvals/templates/`, `ezvals/static/`, `frontend/`
  - **Python API**: `ezvals/decorators.py`, `ezvals/context.py`, `ezvals/storage.py`
  - **Docs/Tests only**: `docs/`, `tests/`, `README.md`

## 4. UAT Based on What Changed

Consult the relevant spec in `docs/.spec/` for expected behavior.

### If CLI changes detected:
- Run `uv run ezvals run examples --visual` and verify the output looks correct
- If specific CLI flags were added or changed, test those explicitly
- Verify exit code is 0

### If UI changes detected:
- Build frontend if source changed: `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..`
- Start the server with auto-run: `uv run ezvals serve examples --session merge-uat --run`
- Write and execute Playwright scripts to verify the changes:
  - Use `sync_playwright()` with headless chromium
  - Wait for `networkidle` before inspecting
  - Take screenshots as evidence
  - Check behavior against `docs/.spec/EXPERIENCE_SPEC_WEBUI.md`
- Kill the server when done

### If Python API changes detected:
- Run `uv run ezvals run examples --visual` to verify evals still work
- If new decorator options or context methods were added, verify the examples exercise them

### If docs/tests only:
- Skim the changes, confirm they look reasonable
- No active UAT needed

## 5. Report UAT Results

Summarize:
- What was tested
- What passed
- Any issues or spec deviations found
- Screenshots if UI was tested

## 6. Squash Merge Into Dev (If UAT Passes)

```bash
git merge --squash <branch>
git commit -m "<concise summary of the feature>"
```

Use a concise commit message in lowercase imperative mood (e.g. "add export feature", "fix context bug").

Then delete the merged branch:

```bash
git branch -d <branch>
```

If the merged branch was associated with a GitHub issue, move the issue to **Done** on the project board. See the "GitHub Projects Workflow" section in CLAUDE.local.md for the `gh` commands and option IDs.

## Error Handling

- If UAT fails or something looks wrong: STOP, report findings, `git checkout dev`, do NOT merge
- If rebase conflicts: abort rebase, report conflicting files, STOP
- If worktree removal fails: stop and ask for help
