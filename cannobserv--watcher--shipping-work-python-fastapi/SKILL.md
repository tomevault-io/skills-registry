description: For Python/FastAPI projects (uv + ruff + pytest): finalizes work by ensuring everything is committed, pushed to the remote, and reflected on GitHub: closes issues, posts summary comments, and presents a completion table. Use when the user says 'ship it', 'push GH', 'close GH', or 'wrap up' and the project is a FastAPI service. Use when this capability is needed.

# Shipping Work — Python/FastAPI — watcher

Finalizes work: pre-ship checks, clean commit, push, GitHub issue comments, and closure. Tuned for Python FastAPI projects (uv + ruff + pytest).

## The Iron Law

```
NO PUSH WITHOUT PASSING PRE-SHIP CHECKS — VERIFIED IN THIS SESSION
NO ISSUE CLOSURE WITHOUT FULL IMPLEMENTATION — VERIFIED AGAINST ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS
```

## Rationalization prevention

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Checks passed earlier in this session" | Run them again. State can change. Require fresh output. |
| "It's basically done, just needs minor cleanup" | Incomplete = not done. Finish or explicitly descope before closing. |
| "The issue will track follow-up work" | Only close if the core requirement is fully met. Open a new issue for follow-up. |
| "gh push is failing, I'll skip it" | Resolve the error. Do not mark as shipped without a successful push. |
| "User is in a hurry" | A bad ship is slower than a good one. Run the checklist. |

## Parameterized invocation

Trigger phrases may include scope inline — e.g., `wrap up #19 #20`, `ship it #14`. Apply the appended issue numbers as the explicit scope (step 1 of Scope detection); skip the conversation-context fallback.

## Scope detection

Determine which GitHub issue(s) to close (priority order):
1. **Explicit scope** — user specifies issue number(s)
2. **Conversation context** — issues referenced in recent commit messages or discussion
3. **Ask** — if ambiguous, confirm before closing anything

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Run pre-ship checks

```bash
bash scripts/pre-ship.sh
```

```
NO CONTINUATION IF CHECKS FAIL
```

If checks fail: stop, report the failure, fix before proceeding. Do not push failing code under any circumstances.

### Step 1.5 — Documentation spot-check

```bash
bash scripts/doc-check.sh
```

`doc-check.sh` lists files changed on this branch vs the upstream default branch and flags any that match the project's `SENSITIVE_PATHS` array (AGENTS.md, README.md, pyproject.toml, uv.lock, schema.sql, route/model/core dirs, `.env.example`). When sensitive paths change, the matching doc sections may need updates too.

If the script exits 1: review the listed files, decide whether each requires a doc update, and either commit the docs now or note them as deliberate skips. If the script exits 2: an infra/tooling problem prevented the doc check from running — investigate the underlying error rather than proceeding.

### Step 2 — Ensure a clean working tree

```bash
bash scripts/check-status.sh
```

If uncommitted changes exist, commit them following the watcher convention:

```
#<number> [type]: <description>       # with GH issue
[type]: <description>                 # without GH issue
```

Common `[type]` values: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`. Scope parens optional: `chore(cr): ...`.

Multiple issues: `#19, #20 [type]: <description>`

### Step 2.5 — Worktree-aware merge (if applicable)

If this checkout is a worktree (test: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` differs from the main checkout, listed first in `git worktree list`):

1. Commit current changes inside the worktree (Step 2 above)
2. Invoke `using-git-worktrees` Phase 4 to merge the branch back into the main checkout before continuing
3. The remaining steps (push, GH comments, close) run from the main checkout

If this is a single (non-worktree) checkout, skip this step.

### Step 3 — Ensure on main

If Step 2.5 applied, the merge already happened — you're on `main` in the main checkout; continue.
If Step 2.5 did not apply (single checkout) and you're on a feature branch, merge to `main` first.

### Step 4 — Push

```bash
bash scripts/push.sh
```

Confirm push succeeded before proceeding.

### Step 5 — Comment on GitHub issues

For each issue in scope:

```bash
bash scripts/comment-issue.sh <number> "<summary>"
```

Comment must include:
- What was implemented (2–4 bullets)
- Key commit SHAs or commit range
- Any follow-up items or known limitations

### Step 6 — Close GitHub issues

<HARD-GATE>
Before closing any issue, verify the original requirements against what was implemented:
1. Re-read the issue body
2. Confirm each stated requirement is addressed in commits
3. If any requirement is missing: do NOT close — ask the user whether to descope or continue
</HARD-GATE>

```bash
bash scripts/close-issue.sh <number>
```

### Step 7 — Report

Present a summary table:

| Issue | Title | Status | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|
| #19 | ... | ✅ Closed | Summary posted |

### Step 8 — Next-steps notification

After the summary table, review commits and changes shipped to identify any post-deploy work the user may need to perform. Common categories for Python/FastAPI:

| Category | Trigger | Example action |
|---|---|---|
| DB migration | `schema.sql` changed | `apply_schema` or `systemctl restart <project>` |
| Service restart | Code change (no auto-reload in prod) | `systemctl restart <project>` |
| Integration tests | New `@pytest.mark.integration` tests | `uv run pytest -m integration` on a real env |
| Env var / secret | New config key | Add to `/etc/<project>/env` and restart |
| Dev-server cleanup | Worktree shutdown | `fuser -k <port>/tcp` for the project's port |

Present only the items that apply. Be specific — name the file, command, or path. Then **offer to execute** any item within your capabilities. Ask once — don't nag.

If nothing applies, omit this step entirely.

## Notes

- If `gh` CLI hits errors (e.g., Projects API changes), use `--json` flag workarounds as needed
- The project's AGENTS.md is authoritative for commit conventions — read it before committing
- `pre-ship.sh` auto-derives its per-SHA stamp prefix from `$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")` — no project-name substitution needed
