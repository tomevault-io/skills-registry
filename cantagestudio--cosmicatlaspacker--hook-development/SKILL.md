# Hook Development for Claude Code Plugins

## Overview

Hooks are event-driven automation scripts that execute in response to Claude Code events. Use hooks to validate operations, enforce policies, add context, and integrate external tools into workflows.

## Hook Types

### Prompt-Based Hooks (Recommended)
Use LLM-driven decision making for context-aware validation.

### Command Hooks
Execute bash commands for deterministic checks.

## Hook Events

| Event | When | Use For |
|-------|------|---------|
| PreToolUse | Before tool | Validation, modification |
| PostToolUse | After tool | Feedback, logging |
| UserPromptSubmit | User input | Context, validation |
| Stop | Agent stopping | Completeness check |
| SubagentStop | Subagent done | Task validation |
| SessionStart | Session begins | Context loading |
| SessionEnd | Session ends | Cleanup, logging |
| PreCompact | Before compact | Preserve context |
| Notification | User notified | Logging, reactions |

## Environment Variables

- `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` - Project root path
- `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` - Plugin directory
- `$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` - SessionStart only: persist env vars here

## Best Practices

- Use prompt-based hooks for complex logic
- Use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} for portability
- Validate all inputs in command hooks
- Set appropriate timeouts
