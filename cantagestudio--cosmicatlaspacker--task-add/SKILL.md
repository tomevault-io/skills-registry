description: [Task Mgmt] A Skill that adds new tasks with priority tags to Docs/Task/{StepName}_Task.md documents for multi-agent parallel development. AI agent MUST invoke this skill AUTOMATICALLY when (1) discovering new work items during implementation, (2) user requests a new feature/fix, (3) breaking down a large task into subtasks, (4) identifying follow-up work after completing a task. CRITICAL - Never modify document structure, only add tasks with proper priority tags (!high, !medium, !low). Tasks should be distributed to avoid file conflicts between workers. (user) Use when this capability is needed.

# Task Add

Add new tasks to Task documents when work items are discovered. Design tasks for parallel development across multiple workers.

## Trigger Conditions

| Agent Action | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| User requests new feature | "Add dark mode toggle" |
| Discovering bug during work | Found edge case that needs fix |
| Breaking down large task | Split into subtasks |
| Identifying follow-up work | "After this, we need to..." |

## Task Format

```markdown
- [ ] TaskTitle #tag !priority Deadline(yyyy:mm:dd)
  - [ ] Subtask 1
  - [ ] Subtask 2
  - [ ] Subtask 3
```

## ⛔ CRITICAL: Subtask is MANDATORY

**Every task MUST have at least 3 subtasks. A task without subtasks is INCOMPLETE and will be REJECTED.**

❌ **FORBIDDEN - Task without subtasks:**
```markdown
- [ ] Implement login feature #auth !high
```

✅ **REQUIRED - Task WITH subtasks:**
```markdown
- [ ] Implement login feature #auth !high
  - [ ] Design login UI layout
  - [ ] Create LoginView SwiftUI component
  - [ ] Implement form validation logic
  - [ ] Add API integration for authentication
  - [ ] Handle error states and messages
```

### Subtask Requirements

| Requirement | Rule |
|-------------|------|
| **Minimum Count** | Every task MUST have **at least 3 subtasks** |
| **Granularity** | Each subtask completable in 1-2 hours |
| **Specificity** | Use action verbs: Create, Implement, Add, Design, Configure |
| **Independence** | Each subtask independently verifiable |

### Subtask Generation by Task Type

| Task Type | Required Subtasks |
|-----------|-------------------|
| New Feature | UI 설계, 컴포넌트 생성, 로직 구현, API 연동, 에러 처리 |
| Bug Fix | 원인 분석, 수정 코드 작성, 엣지 케이스 확인, 테스트 검증 |
| Refactoring | 기존 코드 분석, 새 구조 설계, 마이그레이션, 테스트 |
| Documentation | 구조 파악, 내용 작성, 예제 추가 |

## Section Placement

| Task Type | Target Section |
|-----------|----------------|
| New feature request | Backlog |
| Bug found during work | Backlog |
| Subtask breakdown | Same section as parent |
| Follow-up work | Backlog |

## 🔀 Parallel Development Guidelines

**⚠️ CRITICAL: When adding tasks, consider parallel development:**

1. **Design for Independence**: Each task should be completable without modifying files that other tasks touch
2. **Isolate by Directory**: Prefer tasks that work in separate directories (e.g., `/Views/FeatureA/` vs `/Views/FeatureB/`)
3. **Avoid Shared File Edits**: Don't create multiple tasks that modify the same file

## Tag Reference

| Tag | Use Case |
|-----|----------|
| `#feature` | New functionality |
| `#bug` | Bug fix |
| `#refactor` | Code improvement |
| `#docs` | Documentation |
| `#test` | Testing |
| `#ui` | UI/UX work |

## Priority Reference

| Priority | Use Case | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `!high` | Urgent, blocker | Build failure, crash, critical bug |
| `!medium` | Normal priority | General feature development (default) |
| `!low` | Nice to have | Refactoring, documentation, code cleanup |

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Format Protection

**Absolute Rules:**
- NEVER modify existing Task document structure
- ONLY add priority tags (`!high`, `!medium`, `!low`)
- NEVER change section order, table structure, or markdown format

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Task Document Format Rules

**Strict Format Requirements:**
- Subtasks MUST use exactly 2-space indentation (no more, no less)
- NO intermediate grouping headers (e.g., `### Phase 1`, `#### Step A`) are allowed
- Task hierarchy is flat: Parent task → Subtasks (2-space indent) ONLY

## ⛔ CRITICAL: Duplicate Section Prevention

**Before ANY edit, verify document structure:**

1. **Read entire file first** - Check existing section headers
2. **Count section occurrences** - Each section (`## Backlog`, `## Worker1`, etc.) MUST appear exactly ONCE
3. **If duplicates found** - STOP and fix by merging duplicate sections
4. **Add tasks to EXISTING sections** - NEVER create new section headers

**Detection Pattern:**
```
## Review    ← First occurrence (KEEP)
...tasks...
## Done      ← First occurrence (KEEP)
...tasks...
## Review    ← DUPLICATE (REMOVE - merge tasks to first ## Review)
## Done      ← DUPLICATE (REMOVE - merge tasks to first ## Done)
```

**Fix Procedure:**
1. Identify all duplicate sections
2. Merge tasks from duplicate sections into first occurrence
3. Delete duplicate section headers and empty lines
4. Verify only ONE of each section exists

## Workflow

1. **Read entire Task file** - Verify no duplicate sections exist
2. Identify new work item
3. Determine appropriate Task file (by stage)
4. **Determine priority** (use Priority Decision Guide)
5. Format task with proper syntax including priority tag
6. **⛔ MANDATORY: Generate 3+ subtasks** - Analyze scope, break down by work type
7. **Find existing target section** (DO NOT create new section)
8. Add task WITH subtasks to section (bottom of existing section)
9. **Verify subtask count** - Must have at least 3 subtasks
10. **Before saving** - Verify no duplicate sections created
11. Save file
