# Variant Consistency Checker

Validate UI component usage against design system specifications.

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 scripts/check_variants.py --spec components-spec.yml --source src/
```

## Issue Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `unknown-variant` | Variant not in spec |
| `unknown-size` | Size not in spec |
| `missing-prop` | Required prop absent |
| `deprecated` | Using deprecated component |
| `disallowed-combination` | Invalid prop combination |
| `unknown-component` | Component not in spec |
| `unknown-prop` | Prop not defined (strict mode) |

## Detection Examples

### React/JSX
```jsx
// Issues detected:
<Button variant="outline" size="xl" />
//       ↑ unknown-variant  ↑ unknown-size

<Button variant="primary" />
//       ↑ missing-prop: children
```
