# Planning Implementation

## When to Use

- Creating structured approach BEFORE implementing
- Breaking down complex work into steps
- Designing architecture for new features
- Planning refactoring or system changes
- Analyzing impact before major changes

## Core Steps

### 1. Clarify Requirements (if ambiguous)

**Ask discovery questions** (5-7 max):

1. **Happy Path:** Describe successful scenario step-by-step
2. **Edge Cases:** Empty state, invalid input, errors, large datasets?
3. **Scope Boundaries:** What's explicitly OUT of scope?
4. **Performance:** Instant (<100ms), fast (<1s), or eventual (loading)?
5. **Integration:** Interactions with existing features, APIs, auth?

**Feature-specific questions:**
- **Auth:** Credentials approach, session duration, failure handling?
- **CRUD:** Validation rules, concurrent edits, delete behavior?
- **Search:** Scope, match type, timing (live/submit)?
- **Real-time:** Update mechanism (polling/WebSocket), frequency, offline?

**Generate inferences with confidence levels:**
```markdown
[INFER-HIGH]: JWT in httpOnly cookies (security best practice)
[INFER-MEDIUM]: Debounced search 300ms (balance UX + performance)
[INFER-LOW]: Max 100 results per page (prevent UI overload)
```

**Get approval before proceeding** if requirements are unclear.

### 2. Investigation Phase (CRITICAL)

**Read project documentation first:**
- `docs/product-requirements.md` - project goals, existing features (F-##)
- `docs/feature-spec/F-##-*.md` - technical details
- `docs/system-design.md` - architecture patterns
- `docs/api-contracts.yaml` - API standards
- `docs/design-spec.md` - UI patterns

**Investigation checklist:**
- [ ] ALL affected files identified (complete impact analysis)
- [ ] Current system architecture understood
- [ ] All dependencies and integration points mapped
- [ ] Existing patterns and conventions documented
- [ ] Data models and schemas reviewed
- [ ] Current data flows traced
- [ ] ALL call sites found (especially for refactors)
- [ ] Test impact assessed
- [ ] Breaking changes identified

**Investigation approach (choose based on scope):**

**Small/contained features:**
Use direct tools (Grep, Glob, Read) for focused analysis.

**Large/complex changes or refactors:**
Delegate to `Explore` agents in parallel for comprehensive impact analysis:
- Find ALL affected files across codebase
- Identify every usage, call site, and dependency
- Map integration points and data flows
- Discover existing patterns to follow
- Identify breaking changes and ripple effects

**Parallel investigation patterns:**

**Pattern 1: Full-stack feature/refactor**
- Agent 1: Backend analysis (services, APIs, models, call sites, integrations)
- Agent 2: Frontend analysis (components, state, API clients, dependencies)
- Agent 3: Data layer (schema, queries, migrations, integrity)

**Pattern 2: Architecture + integration**
- Agent 1: Current system (organization, stack, patterns, boundaries)
- Agent 2: Integration needs (external APIs, auth, database, libraries)

**Pattern 3: Single domain** (contained feature)
- Agent 1: Complete domain analysis (ALL files, call sites, dependencies, imports, tests, config)

### 3. Create Implementation Plan

**Write plan to `docs/plans/[feature-slug]/plan.md`**

Use templates for structure:
- Small: `~/.claude/file-templates/plan.quick.template.md`
- Medium: `~/.claude/file-templates/plan.template.md`
- Large: `~/.claude/file-templates/plan.comprehensive.template.md`

**Plan template structure:**

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

## Overview
[Brief description of what we're building and why]

## Requirements Summary
[Key requirements from clarification phase]

## Investigation Artifacts
[Link agent responses or summarize findings]

## Tasks

### Task 1: [Name]
**What:** [What needs to be done]
**Files:** [Files to create/modify]
**Dependencies:** None / Requires Task X

### Task 2: [Name]
**What:** [What needs to be done]
**Files:** [Files to create/modify]
**Dependencies:** Requires Task 1

## Parallelization Opportunities
[Identify groups of independent tasks]

## Integration Points
- [External systems or APIs]
- [Existing features that interact]

## Testing Strategy
- [Key test scenarios]
- [Coverage requirements]

## Risks
- [Potential issues or unknowns]
- [Breaking changes]

## Key Decisions
- [Important technical decisions with reasoning]
```

**Plan size: 3-6 main tasks** (break complex work into manageable chunks)

**Identify parallelization:**
```markdown
## Batch 1 (Parallel - no shared dependencies)
- Task 1: Backend API endpoint
- Task 2: Frontend component
- Task 3: Database migration

## Batch 2 (Sequential - depends on Batch 1)
- Task 4: Integration layer
- Task 5: Tests
```

**Default to sequential unless clear benefit to parallel execution.**

### 4. Link Plan to Project Docs (if applicable)

Update project documentation using available commands:

**Before implementation:**
- Validate current documentation state
- Add new features if plan introduces them (creates F-## IDs, entries)
- Update requirements if plan changes scope, metrics, or risks

**After implementation:**
- Add user stories linked to features
- Add new API endpoints
- Update design if UI components or patterns were added

**Documentation scope:**
- `docs/product-requirements.yaml`
- `docs/feature-specs/F-##-[slug].yaml`
- `docs/user-stories/US-###-[slug].yaml`
- `docs/api-contracts.yaml`
- `docs/system-design.yaml`
- `docs/data-plan.yaml`
- `docs/design-spec.yaml`

### 5. Present Plan for Approval

Share:
- Key tasks (3-6 items)
- Major integration points
- Any breaking changes
- Parallelization opportunities

**Get explicit approval before implementation.**

## Investigation Checklist by Category

**For new features:**
- [ ] Read existing feature specs for patterns
- [ ] Check system design for architecture guidance
- [ ] Review API contracts for naming conventions
- [ ] Examine similar features in codebase
- [ ] Identify all affected domains

**For refactors:**
- [ ] Find ALL files importing/using the code
- [ ] Identify ALL call sites (not just obvious ones)
- [ ] Locate ALL tests
- [ ] Check configuration files
- [ ] Find documentation references
- [ ] Identify ripple effects

**For integrations:**
- [ ] Review existing integration patterns
- [ ] Check authentication/authorization approach
- [ ] Understand error handling conventions
- [ ] Identify shared utilities
- [ ] Map external API dependencies

## Common Patterns

### Quick Planning (Small changes)

```markdown
# Plan: [Feature Name]

## Goal
[What we're building and why]

## Tasks
1. [Task] - [Files] - [Dependencies]
2. [Task] - [Files] - [Dependencies]
3. [Task] - [Files] - [Dependencies]

## Key Decisions
- [Important technical decision with reasoning]

## Risks
- [Potential issues]
```

### Investigation Tools

**Direct investigation:**
- `Read` - Examine existing code and docs
- `Grep` - Find all usages, imports, call sites
- `Glob` - Find files by pattern

**Comprehensive investigation (refactors, large features):**
```bash
# Find all imports
grep -r "import.*ComponentName" --include="*.tsx"

# Find all usages
grep -r "ComponentName" --include="*.ts"

# Find tests
grep -r "describe.*ComponentName" --include="*.test.ts"
```

**For parallel analysis:**
- Delegate `Explore` agents for pattern discovery
- Monitor agent responses from `agent-responses/` directory
- Link investigation artifacts in final plan

## Example: Planning a New API Feature

### Step 1: Clarify
- Happy path: User creates X, receives Y response
- Edge cases: Invalid input, duplicate keys, concurrent requests
- Performance: Response time <200ms
- Integration: Requires authentication, updates cache

### Step 2: Investigate
- Read `docs/api-contracts.yaml` for naming/structure patterns
- Search for similar endpoints (e.g., CRUD patterns)
- Find authentication middleware usage
- Check cache invalidation patterns
- Identify all affected services

### Step 3: Plan
- Task 1: Add API schema to contracts
- Task 2: Implement controller/handler
- Task 3: Add service layer logic
- Task 4: Implement persistence
- Task 5: Add cache invalidation
- Task 6: Write tests

### Step 4: Approval
Share plan with stakeholders, get sign-off.

### Step 5: Handoff
Pass plan + investigation results to implementation agents.

## Key Principles

- **Nothing is left to assumptions.** Thorough investigation is mandatory.
- **Default to agent-based impact analysis** for refactors and cross-cutting changes.
- **Use direct tools for small, contained features** to stay efficient.
- **Breaking changes must be identified early** and communicated clearly.
- **Plans enable parallel execution** when dependencies are clear.
- **Approval gates prevent rework.** Always get sign-off before implementation.
