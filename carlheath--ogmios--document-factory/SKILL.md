Match need to template type (see catalog above)

### Step 3: Gather Inputs

Typical inputs needed:
- **Context:** What's the background?
- **Problem:** What are we solving?
- **Proposal:** What's the solution?
- **Alternatives:** What else was considered?
- **Impact:** What changes and who's affected?
- **Timeline:** When does this happen?

### Step 4: Draft Document

## Universal Document Principles

1. **Lead with the decision** - Put conclusions first
2. **Know your audience** - Adjust detail and jargon
3. **Be specific** - Avoid vague statements
4. **Include alternatives** - Show you considered options
5. **Define success** - How will we know it worked?
6. **Assign ownership** - Who does what by when?
