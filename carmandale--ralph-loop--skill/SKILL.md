## Phase 1: RESEARCH (Required)

**Before creating ANY interview, understand the codebase.**

### What to Research

1. **Find existing patterns** - How does similar functionality work?
2. **Identify files to modify** - What will change?
3. **Understand the architecture** - Where does this fit?
4. **Note naming conventions** - Match existing style

### Research Commands

```bash
# Find relevant files
rg -l "keyword" --type swift
find . -name "*.swift" -path "*/Views/*" | head -20

# Understand existing patterns  
rg -A5 "struct.*View.*:" --type swift | head -50

# Check file structure
tree -L 3 path/to/relevant/code/

# Read key files
cat path/to/existing/similar/feature.swift | head -100
```

### Research Output

Document findings:
```markdown
## Research Findings

**Existing patterns:**
- Views are in Features/*/Views/
- State is in Features/*/State/
- Uses @Observable pattern

**Files that will change:**
- MainSplitView.swift (add new component)
- SomeState.swift (add new property)

**Files to create:**
- NewFeatureView.swift
- NewFeatureState.swift

**Naming conventions:**
- Views: SomethingView.swift
- State: SomethingState.swift
```

---

## Phase 2: INTERVIEW (Required)

**Use the interview tool to gather requirements. Never guess.**

### Interview Question Categories

Every interview MUST cover:

1. **Scope** - What exactly are we building?
2. **Location** - Where does it appear/integrate?
3. **Behavior** - How does it work?
4. **Edge Cases** - What could go wrong?
5. **Acceptance** - How do we know it's done?

### Interview Template

```json
{
  "title": "Ralph Plan: [Feature Name]",
  "description": "I've researched the codebase. Help me understand the requirements.\n\n**What I found:**\n[Brief research summary]",
  "questions": [

      "question": "Any constraints or requirements I should know?",
      "required": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Phase 3: DESIGN (Required)

**After interview, design the solution before writing tasks.**

### Design Document Template

```markdown
## Design: [Feature Name]

### Interview Summary
- Scope: [answer]
- Location: [answer]  
- Behavior: [answer]
- Edge cases: [answer]
- Acceptance: [answer]

### Architecture

**New files to create:**
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| NewView.swift | Main UI component |
| NewState.swift | State management |

**Files to modify:**
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| MainSplitView.swift | Add NewView to layout |
| AppState.swift | Add newState property |

**Integration points:**
- NewView will be added to MainSplitView in the detail area
- NewState will be owned by AppState
- NewView observes NewState via @Environment

### UI Mockup (if applicable)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Existing UI]                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [New Feature Here]                 │
│  - Element A                        │
│  - Element B                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Feature appears in correct location
- [ ] Primary behavior works
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] User acceptance criteria met
```

---

## Phase 4: EXPERT REVIEW (Required)

**Use rp-cli plan mode to get expert review of the design.**

### Select Context Files

```bash
# Select files relevant to the design
rp-cli manage_selection '{
  "op": "set",
  "paths": [
    "path/to/existing/similar.swift",
    "path/to/where/integration/happens.swift"
  ]
}'
```

### Request Design Review

```bash
rp-cli chat_send '{
  "mode": "plan",
  "new_chat": true,
  "chat_name": "Design Review: [Feature Name]",
  "message": "Please review this design for a new feature.\n\n## Design\n[paste design document]\n\n## Questions\n1. Is this architecture sound?\n2. Am I missing any integration points?\n3. Are there existing patterns I should follow?\n4. Any potential issues or edge cases?"
}'
```

### Process Review Feedback

- Update design based on feedback
- Note any architectural changes
- If major issues found, return to Phase 3

---

## Phase 5: ORACLE (Complex Features Only)

**For complex features, get deep architecture review from Oracle (GPT-5 Pro).**

### When to Use Oracle

- Multiple subsystems involved
- New architectural patterns needed
- Cross-cutting concerns (auth, sync, caching)
- Integration with external services
- Performance-critical paths

### Oracle Query Template

```
I need architecture advice for: [feature name]

## Context
[Brief project description]
[Current architecture]

## What I'm Building
[Feature description]
[Current design]

## Specific Questions
1. [Architecture question]
2. [Pattern question]
3. [Integration question]

## Constraints
[Performance, compatibility, etc.]
```

### Process Oracle Response

- Update design with Oracle recommendations
- Document key decisions and rationale
- If significant changes, re-run Phase 4 review

---

## Phase 6: CREATE PLAN (Critical)

**Write tasks that are atomic, complete, and verifiable.**

### Task Anatomy

Every task MUST have:

1. **WHAT** - The specific change to make
2. **WHERE** - The exact file(s) to modify
3. **HOW** - Brief implementation approach (if not obvious)
4. **VERIFY** - How to confirm it worked

### Task Sizing (Critical)

**All tasks should be similar size** - the LLM struggles with inconsistent sizing.

| Task Size | Time Estimate | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Too small | < 2 min | "Add import statement" |
| ✅ Right | 5-15 min | "Create SyncConsolePanel view with basic layout" |
| Too large | > 30 min | "Implement entire sync feature with all UI" |

**Why this matters:** Large tasks get "swallowed up" - the LLM runs out of context window before finishing, producing incomplete or buggy code. If a task would take a human > 30 minutes, split it.

### Task Writing Rules

#### Rule 1: Atomic = One Concern

❌ BAD: "Add sync panel with drag handle and animations"
✅ GOOD: Three separate tasks

#### Rule 2: Consistent Size

❌ BAD: Mix of tiny ("add import") and huge ("implement feature") tasks
✅ GOOD: All tasks take roughly 5-15 minutes of LLM work

#### Rule 3: Complete = Create + Integrate

❌ BAD: "Create SyncConsolePanel view"
✅ GOOD: "Create SyncConsolePanel view in SharedUI/Common/ AND replace SyncProgressView with it in MainSplitView.swift"

#### Rule 4: Specific Files Named

❌ BAD: "Add the button to the toolbar"
✅ GOOD: "Add refresh button to toolbar in MediaOrganizationView.swift toolbarContent"

#### Rule 5: Verification Included

❌ BAD: "Add drag handle"
✅ GOOD: "Add drag handle to panel. VERIFY: Dragging handle resizes panel height"

### Plan Structure

```markdown
# Plan: [Feature Name]

## Context
[What we're building and why]

## Interview Responses ([date])
- Scope: [answer]
- Location: [answer]
- Behavior: [answer]

## Design Review Notes
[Key feedback from rp-cli review]
[Oracle recommendations if applicable]

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] 1.1 [Task with WHAT, WHERE, VERIFY]
- [ ] 1.2 [Task with WHAT, WHERE, VERIFY]

### Phase 2: Core Implementation  
- [ ] 2.1 [Task with WHAT, WHERE, VERIFY]
- [ ] 2.2 [Task with WHAT, WHERE, VERIFY]

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] 3.1 [Task with WHAT, WHERE, VERIFY]

### Phase 4: Verification
- [ ] 4.1 VERIFY: [Acceptance criteria 1]
- [ ] 4.2 VERIFY: [Acceptance criteria 2]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1 from interview]
- [ ] [Criterion 2 from interview]

## Files Changed
| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| path/to/new.swift | CREATE |
| path/to/existing.swift | MODIFY |
```

---

## Phase 7: PLAN REVIEW (Required)

**Use rp-cli plan mode to review the task list before execution.**

### Select Plan Context

```bash
# Select files that will be modified
rp-cli manage_selection '{
  "op": "set", 
  "paths": [
    "path/to/file1.swift",
    "path/to/file2.swift"
  ]
}'
```

### Request Plan Review

```bash
rp-cli chat_send '{
  "mode": "plan",
  "new_chat": true,
  "chat_name": "Plan Review: [Feature Name]",
  "message": "Please review this implementation plan.\n\n## Plan\n[paste full plan]\n\n## Review Checklist\n1. Does every CREATE task have a corresponding INTEGRATE task?\n2. Are all file paths correct and specific?\n3. Is each task atomic (one concern)?\n4. Does each task have a VERIFY step?\n5. Are there any missing tasks or integration points?\n6. Will this plan work in YOLO mode (non-interactive)?"
}'
```

### Process Review Feedback

- Fix any issues identified
- Add missing tasks
- Clarify ambiguous descriptions
- Ensure all integration points covered

---

## Phase 8: FINALIZE (Required)

**Get user approval before execution.**

### Finalization Checklist

Before presenting to user, verify:

- [ ] Every "create" task has a corresponding "integrate" task
- [ ] Every task names specific files
- [ ] Every task has a VERIFY step
- [ ] Phase 4 has explicit verification tasks
- [ ] Success criteria match interview answers
- [ ] Files Changed table is complete
- [ ] Design review feedback incorporated
- [ ] Plan review feedback incorporated

### Present to User

```markdown
## Plan Ready: [Feature Name]

**Summary:**
- [N] tasks across [M] phases
- [X] files to create, [Y] files to modify

**Reviews completed:**
- ✅ Design review (rp-cli plan mode)
- ✅ Plan review (rp-cli plan mode)
- [✅ Oracle review (if applicable)]

**Key decisions:**
- [Decision 1 from interview/reviews]
- [Decision 2 from interview/reviews]

**How to proceed:**
1. **Review full plan** - See all tasks
2. **Edit plan** - Make changes before running
3. **Launch YOLO** - Execute all tasks automatically
4. **Interactive mode** - Work task by task

Ready to launch?
```

---

## Phase 9: EXECUTE

### Launch YOLO Mode

```bash
cd /path/to/project
ralph yolo
# Type 'yolo' to confirm
# Runs all tasks non-interactively
# Auto-commits each task
# Codex review runs automatically at end
```

### Monitor Execution

- Watch for build failures
- Note any tasks that seem to struggle
- Be ready to intervene if needed

### On Failure

```bash
ralph status    # See where we stopped
ralph next      # Fix the issue interactively
ralph yolo      # Continue from current task
```

---

## Phase 10: POST-REVIEW (Required)

**After YOLO completes, review the changes.**

### Automatic Codex Review

Ralph automatically runs codex review after YOLO completes:
```
Running final codex review on N commits (abc123..def456)...
```

If codex review doesn't run automatically:
```bash
codex review --base <start-commit>
```

### Manual Verification

For UI changes, verify visually:
```bash
gj run ms  # Or appropriate run command
# Check that feature works as expected
```

### rp-cli Post-Implementation Review (Optional)

For complex changes, request a post-implementation review:

```bash
rp-cli manage_selection '{
  "op": "set",
  "paths": ["files/that/changed.swift"]
}'

rp-cli chat_send '{
  "mode": "plan",
  "new_chat": true,
  "chat_name": "Post-Review: [Feature Name]",
  "message": "Please review these changes for:\n1. Code quality issues\n2. Missing error handling\n3. Performance concerns\n4. Consistency with project patterns"
}'
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| Skipping research | Questions are vague, plan is wrong |
| Skipping interview | Assumptions lead to rework |
| Skipping design review | Architecture issues caught too late |
| Skipping plan review | Missing tasks, broken YOLO |
| "Create X" without integration | Component built but never used |
| No file paths in tasks | Agent guesses wrong location |
| No verification tasks | Feature broken but marked done |
| Huge tasks | Too much scope, partial completion |
| Inconsistent task sizes | Large tasks "swallowed up", small tasks waste iterations |
| No success criteria | No way to know if done |
| Skipping post-review | Bugs ship to production |
| Not appending to progress.txt | Lost learnings, repeated mistakes |

---

## rp-cli Quick Reference

### Setup Selection
```bash
rp-cli manage_selection '{"op": "set", "paths": ["file1.swift", "file2.swift"]}'
rp-cli manage_selection '{"op": "get", "view": "files"}'
```

### Plan Mode Review
```bash
rp-cli chat_send '{
  "mode": "plan",
  "new_chat": true,
  "chat_name": "Review: Topic",
  "message": "Review request..."
}'
```

### Continue Conversation
```bash
rp-cli chat_send '{
  "mode": "plan",
  "new_chat": false,
  "message": "Follow-up question..."
}'
```

### List Available Models
```bash
rp-cli list_models
```

---

## Example: Complete Flow

**User:** "Create a ralph loop for Xcode-style bottom console panel"

### 1. Research
```bash
rg -l "SyncProgress" --type swift
# Found: SyncProgressView.swift (current implementation)
# Found: MainSplitView.swift (where it's used)

cat "SharedUI/Common/SyncProgressView.swift" | head -50
# Current: floating card overlay

cat "Features/MediaOrganization/Views/MainSplitView.swift" | grep -A10 "SyncProgress"
# Integration point identified
```

### 2. Interview
```json
{
  "title": "Ralph Plan: Xcode-style Console Panel",
  "description": "Currently using floating card. You want Xcode-style bottom panel.",
  "questions": [
    {"id": "style", "question": "Confirm: Bottom slide-up panel like Xcode console?"},
    {"id": "resize", "question": "Should panel be resizable via drag?"},
    {"id": "collapse", "question": "Should panel collapse to header-only?"},
    {"id": "shortcut", "question": "Keyboard shortcut? (suggest ⌘⇧C)"},
    {"id": "acceptance", "question": "How will you verify it works?"}
  ]
}
```

### 3. Design
```markdown
## Design: Xcode-style Console Panel

### Architecture
- CREATE: SyncConsolePanel.swift (new component)
- MODIFY: MainSplitView.swift (replace SyncProgressView)
- MODIFY: AppState.swift (add showSyncConsole toggle)

### Integration
- SyncConsolePanel replaces SyncProgressView in StatusFooter
- Same callbacks (onCancel, onPause, etc.)
- AppState.showSyncConsole controls visibility
```

### 4. Expert Review (rp-cli)
```bash
rp-cli manage_selection '{"op":"set","paths":["SharedUI/Common/SyncProgressView.swift","Features/MediaOrganization/Views/MainSplitView.swift"]}'

rp-cli chat_send '{"mode":"plan","new_chat":true,"chat_name":"Design Review: Console Panel","message":"Review this design..."}'
```

### 5. Create Plan
```markdown
## Tasks

### Phase 1: Create Component
- [ ] 1.1 Create SyncConsolePanel.swift in SharedUI/Common/
      VERIFY: File compiles, preview renders

### Phase 2: Integration  
- [ ] 2.1 Replace SyncProgressView with SyncConsolePanel in MainSplitView.swift StatusFooter
      VERIFY: New panel appears at bottom when sync starts

### Phase 3: Features
- [ ] 3.1 Add drag handle for resizing
      VERIFY: Dragging changes panel height
- [ ] 3.2 Add collapse/expand toggle
      VERIFY: Panel collapses to header only

### Phase 4: Verification
- [ ] 4.1 VERIFY: Panel slides up from bottom (not floating)
- [ ] 4.2 VERIFY: ⌘⇧C toggles visibility
- [ ] 4.3 VERIFY: Drag handle resizes panel
```

### 6. Plan Review (rp-cli)
```bash
rp-cli chat_send '{"mode":"plan","new_chat":true,"message":"Review this plan for YOLO execution..."}'
```

### 7. Finalize & Execute
```bash
ralph yolo
# All tasks execute
# Codex review runs automatically
```

### 8. Post-Review
```bash
# Verify visually
gj run ms
# Check panel appears at bottom, drag works, etc.
```

## Key Principles

1. **Research first** - Understand before asking
2. **Interview always** - Never assume requirements  
3. **Design before tasks** - Architecture drives implementation
4. **Review twice** - Design review + Plan review via rp-cli
5. **Atomic + Complete** - One thing, fully integrated
6. **Verify everything** - Build passing ≠ feature working
7. **Post-review always** - Codex + manual verification
