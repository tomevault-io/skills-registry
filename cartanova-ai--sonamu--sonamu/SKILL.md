# Sonamu Framework Skills

Claude Code skill for developing projects with the Sonamu framework.

## CRITICAL: Ask one question at a time

**MUST ask questions one at a time. NEVER overwhelm users with multiple questions.**

### MUST DO
- One question → wait for user response → next question
- Keep questions concise
- Present choices clearly when options are available

### NEVER DO
- List multiple questions at once
- Ask questions alongside long explanations
- Output a checklist of confirmation items all at once

---

## Development Flow

```
PHASE 0: Project creation and initial setup  (create project → identify domains → auth generate → Users sequence setup)
PHASE 1: Domain logic documentation          (write contract/{domain}/*.contract.md per domain → user confirmation)
PHASE 2: Entity design                       (design with user confirmation)
PHASE 3: Entity creation and migration       (entity.json + migration + cone + scaffolding)
PHASE 4: Testing and API implementation      (contract → Claim → AC → implement, repeat)
PHASE 5: Fixture generation                  (generate with LLM after user approval)
PHASE 6: Frontend development                (proceed in batches with user confirmation)
```

**Full details:** see `.claude/workflow/project_init.md`

### Starting Point Determination

**Begin from the PHASE that matches the user's instruction.** Do not always start from PHASE 0.

| User instruction | Starting PHASE | Prerequisites to verify |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| "Create a new project" | PHASE 0 | — |
| "Write contract" / "Analyze domain" | PHASE 1 | Domain list identified |
| "Add entity" / "Create entity" | PHASE 2 | Project exists, dev server running, read contract/**/*.contract.md, PHASE 1 complete |
| "Write tests" / "Implement API" | PHASE 4 | entity.json exists, migration complete, scaffolding complete |
| "Generate fixtures" | PHASE 5 | Tests passing, cone.note exists |
| "Develop frontend" | PHASE 6 | API implementation complete, contract/**/*.contract.md reviewed |

**Mid-entry rules:**
1. If `contract/**/*.contract.md` and `skills/project/architecture.md` exist, read them first.
2. Verify prerequisites for the target PHASE.
3. If prerequisites are not met, inform the user and begin from the required step.
4. Within a PHASE, follow the numbered steps in `.claude/workflow/project_init.md` in order. Do not skip any step or merge steps on your own judgment.

## Project Document System

### CRITICAL: Read these before starting any task

**Before starting any project task, always read the following documents.**

```
contract/
└── {domain}/
    └── {domain}.contract.md  # PHASE 1: domain rules + decision rationale (permanent; update alongside code changes)

.claude/skills/project/
└── architecture.md      # entity design + system architecture

tmp/claims/              # in-progress Claim YAML (discard after completion)
```

**Code is the ground truth.** `*.contract.md` records the rationale behind code decisions — it is not a spec that precedes the code. When code and `*.contract.md` conflict, the code takes precedence.

### Domain `*.contract.md`

Documents domain rules in a cohesive form and captures decision rationale that cannot be inferred from code alone.

```markdown
# {Domain} Business Logic

## Rules
- Refunds allowed only within 7 days of payment [Rationale: PG provider policy]
- Order status transitions: pending → confirmed → shipped → completed

## Workflow
1. ...
```

**Two development paths:**
- **New**: write `*.contract.md` → Claim → AC (test name) → implement (TDD)
- **Change**: modify code → register Claim → verify/update `*.contract.md` (record change rationale)

**Update rules:**
- When code changes, check affected domain rules and update `*.contract.md` together
- Record the reason and decision rationale — this keeps `*.contract.md` alive

### architecture.md

**When:** designing entities or discussing system architecture
**Content:** entity structure and relationships, database schema, system component structure

### Safe after compacting

Documents are persisted as files, so project context is preserved even when the conversation is compacted.
