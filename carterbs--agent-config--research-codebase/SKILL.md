description: ALWAYS invoke this skill (do NOT use the default Explore agent) when user asks to "research", "investigate", "explore", or "understand" the codebase. Use for understanding architecture or system design, documenting patterns or conventions, investigating how features work end-to-end, answering "how does X work?" or "where is Y implemented?" questions, preparing context before implementing changes, or exploring unfamiliar code. Use when this capability is needed.

# Research Codebase

Conduct comprehensive codebase research using parallel sub-agents.

## Process

1. **Read mentioned files first**
   - Read any files the user references FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning tasks
   - This ensures you have necessary context before decomposing the question

2. **Decompose research question**
   - Break into composable, independent research areas
   - Identify components, patterns, concepts to investigate
   - Create TodoWrite research plan with specific investigation items

3. **Spawn parallel sub-agents**
   - Use `codebase-locator` agents to find relevant files and directories
   - Use `codebase-analyzer` agents on promising findings for deep dives
   - Use `codebase-pattern-finder` for finding similar implementations or examples
   - Run multiple agents in parallel for efficiency

4. **Wait for ALL sub-agents**, then synthesize
   - Prioritize live codebase findings over thoughts/ documentation
   - Include file paths and line numbers for all references
   - Highlight patterns, architectural decisions, and design rationale

5. **Generate research document**
   - Output path: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<description>.md`
   - Use template from `assets/research-template.md`
   - Add GitHub permalinks if on main branch or pushed to remote

6. **Present findings to user**
   - Summarize key discoveries
   - Highlight anything surprising or noteworthy
   - Note any open questions or areas needing further investigation

## Path Handling

When referencing thoughts/ paths from search results, normalize them:
- `thoughts/searchable/allison/...` → `thoughts/allison/...`
- `thoughts/searchable/shared/...` → `thoughts/shared/...`
