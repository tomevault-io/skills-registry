# Analyzing Machine Learning In Investing

Evaluates ML applications in investment management—covering feature engineering, model selection, overfitting mitigation, and production deployment—to determine whether an ML approach can generate durable alpha or improve portfolio construction.

## When To Use

- Evaluating whether a specific ML technique (gradient boosting, neural nets, NLP, reinforcement learning) is appropriate for a given investment problem
- Designing or reviewing an ML pipeline for alpha signal generation, risk forecasting, or execution optimization
- Assessing an existing ML strategy's robustness: out-of-sample performance, regime sensitivity, capacity constraints
- Comparing ML-driven approaches against traditional factor models or rules-based strategies
- Reviewing a fund manager's or vendor's ML claims for due diligence

## Inputs To Gather

- **Investment objective**: Return prediction, risk estimation, portfolio optimization, execution/cost reduction, or alternative data monetization
- **Asset class and universe**: Equities (single-stock vs. sector/index), fixed income, futures/options, crypto, multi-asset
- **Data inventory**: Price/volume history depth, fundamental data, alternative data sources (satellite, NLP sentiment, web scraping), frequency (tick, daily, monthly)
- **Existing modeling baseline**: Current factor model, heuristic rules, or discretionary process being augmented or replaced
- **Infrastructure context**: Backtest framework, data pipeline maturity, latency requirements, compute budget
- **Regulatory and compliance constraints**: Model explainability requirements (e.g., EU AI Act, SEC marketing rule), data licensing restrictions

## Workflow

1. **Frame the prediction task**
   - Define the target variable precisely (forward 5-day return, probability of drawdown > 2%, optimal rebalance timing)
   - Set the prediction horizon and rebalance frequency; confirm alignment with trading costs and capacity
   - Determine whether the problem is regression, classification, ranking, or reinforcement learning

2. **Evaluate feature engineering**
   - Catalog candidate features: price-derived (momentum, volatility, microstructure), fundamental (earnings revisions, credit spreads), alternative (sentiment scores, supply-chain graphs)
   - Assess feature stationarity—flag features that require differencing, z-scoring, or regime conditioning
   - Check for look-ahead bias: ensure all features use point-in-time data with proper lagging
   - Evaluate feature decay rates to determine retraining frequency requirements

3. **Select and benchmark models**
   - Match model complexity to the signal-to-noise ratio of the asset class (e.g., linear/ridge for macro factors; tree ensembles for cross-sectional equity; transformers for NLP on filings)
   - Require a naive baseline (buy-and-hold, equal-weight, persistence forecast) and a traditional factor baseline before evaluating ML lift
   - Document hyperparameter search methodology (Bayesian optimization, cross-validation scheme) and guard against selection bias across multiple model comparisons

4. **Assess overfitting and robustness**
   - Verify walk-forward or purged k-fold cross-validation rather than random splits [VERIFY: confirm CV scheme handles autocorrelation in the specific asset class]
   - Check for combinatorial backtest overfitting: number of strategy variants tried vs. reported Sharpe
   - Stress-test across regimes—rising rates, vol spikes, liquidity crises, sector rotations
   - Evaluate performance sensitivity to feature exclusion (ablation studies) and data vintage changes

5. **Analyze implementation viability**
   - Estimate capacity: at what AUM does market impact erode the signal? Model turnover vs. transaction cost budget
   - Assess latency requirements vs. model inference time; flag models that cannot run within the rebalance window
   - Evaluate model interpretability: can the PM explain position drivers to risk committees and investors?
   - Review data vendor dependency risks—single-source alternative data, licensing renewal risk, data discontinuation scenarios

6. **Document findings**
   - Produce a structured assessment covering: signal strength (IC, hit rate), risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown), capacity estimate, implementation complexity score, and overall recommendation (adopt / pilot / reject)
   - Include a decay analysis showing expected alpha half-life and required retraining cadence
   - Flag all [VERIFY] items requiring domain expert or compliance sign-off

## Output

Deliver an **ML Investment Strategy Assessment** containing:

- **Executive summary**: One-paragraph verdict on feasibility and expected value-add
- **Signal analysis table**: Feature importance rankings, IC by feature group, decay profiles
- **Model comparison matrix**: Baseline vs. ML candidates with in-sample and out-of-sample metrics (Sharpe, IC, turnover, max drawdown)
- **Robustness scorecard**: Regime stress results, ablation sensitivity, backtest overfitting probability estimate
- **Implementation roadmap**: Data pipeline requirements, compute/infra needs, retraining schedule, estimated time-to-production
- **Risk and limitations**: Capacity ceiling, model drift triggers, regulatory explainability gaps, data vendor concentration risk
- **Recommendation**: Adopt / Pilot with conditions / Reject, with specific next steps

## Quality Checks

- Every performance metric is reported both in-sample and out-of-sample; no in-sample-only claims
- Walk-forward validation periods span at least two distinct market regimes (e.g., bull + drawdown)
- Transaction cost assumptions are stated and applied to all return calculations [VERIFY: confirm cost model reflects actual execution in the target market]
- No look-ahead bias in feature construction—all data timestamps verified as point-in-time
- Backtest Sharpe is deflated for multiple testing if more than one strategy variant was evaluated
- Model explainability section is present and sufficient for the fund's regulatory jurisdiction [VERIFY: jurisdiction-specific AI/model governance requirements]
- Alternative data sources are confirmed as compliant with material non-public information (MNPI) restrictions [VERIFY: legal review of each alt-data source]
