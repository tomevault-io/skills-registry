# Report Skill

## When to Use

Use this skill **after verification** to finalize your work on a step and communicate the result to the Orchestrator.

**Triggers:**

- Execution and Verification phases are complete.
- You have been handed off from the **Verify** skill.
- Or, you need to report a **Blocked** status.

---

## Output Contract (CRITICAL)

The Orchestrator expects a **single JSON object** printed to `stdout`. This is how you "report" your status.

**Success JSON:**

```json
{
  "stepId": "<id>",
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "Brief description of work done and verification results",
  "artifacts": ["file1.js", "src/components/NewComp.tsx"],
  "testResults": "Passed 8/8 tests",
  "commitMessage": "feat: add user authentication with session handling"
}
```

**Blocked JSON:**

```json
{
  "stepId": "<id>",
  "status": "blocked",
  "blockedReason": "Detailed reason why the step cannot be completed",
  "summary": "Work attempted but failed due to..."
}
```

**Rules:**

1. **NO Markdown:** Do not wrap the JSON in triple-backtick code blocks (e.g., ` ```json ... ``` `).
2. **Clean Output:** Ensure the JSON is valid and on its own line.
3. **One Object Per Step:** If you are working on multiple steps, you may output multiple JSON objects (one per line).

## How to Do It

### Step 1: Gather Information

Collect from your execution and verification:

- **Status:** Did it pass verification? (`complete` vs `blocked`)
- **Artifacts:** List of files created or modified.
- **Summary:** A concise sentence describing the implementation.
- **Test Results:** Summary of test outcomes (e.g., "Pass: 5, Fail: 0").

### Step 2: Construct the JSON

Map your gathered info to the JSON fields.

- `stepId`: The ID from the plan you are working on.
- `status`: "complete" (if verified) or "blocked".
- `summary`: Human-readable explanation.
- `artifacts`: Array of file paths.
- `commitMessage`: A conventional commit message (e.g., "feat: add login", "fix: resolve null check").

### Step 3: Output to Stdout

Print the JSON string. **This is your final action.**

---

## Example

**Scenario:** You implemented a "Login" feature (Step 3).

**1. Handoff:** You came from `verify` where 2/2 tests passed.
**2. Constructing Report:**

- ID: "3"
- Status: "complete"
- Summary: "Implemented login logic."
- Artifacts: ["src/auth/login.ts"]
- Test Results: "2/2 passed"

**3. Action:**

```json
{
  "stepId": "3",
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "Implemented login logic and verified with unit tests",
  "artifacts": ["src/auth/login.ts"],
  "testResults": "2/2 passed",
  "commitMessage": "feat: add login endpoint with session handling"
}
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Outputting Text:** "I have finished the step." (The Orchestrator cannot read this).
- **Markdown Blocks:** Wrapping JSON in ` ```json ... ``` ` breaks the parser.
- **Invalid JSON:** Ensure the JSON is properly formatted and all strings are quoted.
