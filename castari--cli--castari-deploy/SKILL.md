# Deploy to Castari

Deploy a Claude AI agent to production on Castari. This skill walks through the full flow: CLI installation, authentication, project scaffolding, and deployment.

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Skip any step whose prerequisite is already satisfied.

### Step 1: Check if the Castari CLI is installed

Run:

```bash
cast --version
```

If the command fails or is not found, install the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @castari/cli
```

Then verify installation succeeded by running `cast --version` again.

### Step 2: Check authentication

Run:

```bash
cast whoami
```

If the user is not logged in (command fails or shows "not authenticated"), run:

```bash
cast login
```

This opens a browser for Clerk OAuth. Wait for the user to complete login, then verify with `cast whoami` again.

### Step 3: Check for castari.json

Look for `castari.json` in the current working directory:

```bash
ls castari.json
```

**If castari.json exists:** Read it and confirm the configuration with the user. Proceed to Step 4.

**If castari.json does not exist:** Help scaffold one:

1. Detect the likely entrypoint by checking for these files in order:
   - `src/index.ts`
   - `src/main.ts`
   - `index.ts`
   - `src/index.js`
   - `src/main.js`
   - `index.js`

2. Ask the user for the agent name using AskUserQuestion. Suggest the current directory name as the default.

3. Generate `castari.json` with this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "<agent-name>",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "entrypoint": "<detected-entrypoint>",
  "runtime": "node"
}
```

Write the file and show the user what was created.

### Step 4: Deploy

Run the deployment:

```bash
cast deploy
```

This packages the project, uploads it, and deploys to an isolated cloud sandbox. The command may take up to a minute. Show the user the output including status and sandbox ID.

### Step 5: Verify deployment

After successful deployment, show the user a summary:
- Agent name/slug
- Deployment status
- Sandbox ID (if returned)

### Step 6: Offer to test

Ask the user if they want to test the deployed agent. If yes, ask for a test prompt and run:

```bash
cast invoke <agent-slug> "<test-prompt>"
```

## Error Handling

- **npm not found:** Ask the user to install Node.js (>= 18) first.
- **Authentication failure:** Suggest running `cast login` again or checking network connectivity.
- **No entrypoint detected:** Ask the user to specify their entrypoint file manually.
- **Deploy failure:** Show the full error output and suggest checking `castari.json` configuration or running `cast agents list` to verify the agent exists.

## Notes

- The CLI requires Node.js >= 18.
- Authentication uses Clerk OAuth (browser-based).
- Deployments run in isolated cloud sandboxes.
- The `castari.json` file is the project manifest — it must be in the repo root.
- Common entrypoints: `src/index.ts` for TypeScript projects, `index.js` for JavaScript.
