description: Documentation policies and standards. Use when creating, updating, or reviewing any documentation — READMEs, TESTING.md, inline docs, file headers, or doc-related PRs. Use when this capability is needed.

<principle>
Code documents itself through naming. Documentation exists only for what naming cannot express: architecture decisions, onboarding context, external integration details, and cross-cutting concerns that span multiple files.
</principle>

<naming_over_docs>
A well-named function needs no docstring. A well-named file needs no README beside it. A well-named directory needs no index. Long, descriptive, obvious names are the primary documentation system. Never abbreviate. If you find yourself writing a comment or doc to explain something, rename the thing instead.
</naming_over_docs>

<never_write>
Directory trees, file lists, or structure snapshots. These go stale the moment something changes.
</never_write>

<evergreen>
Documentation must stay accurate without maintenance. Reference patterns, not current state. Point to locations, not copies. Write "tests live in tests/" not a tree of every test file. Write "scripts follow the pattern in rebuild" not a list of every script. If documentation requires updating every time code changes, it is written wrong.
</evergreen>

<when_docs_are_needed>
Architecture decisions that affect multiple modules. Non-obvious constraints from upstream dependencies. Migration guides for breaking changes. These are the only valid reasons to write documentation. External documentation or reference to a external docs.
</when_docs_are_needed>

<policy_documentation>
A policy is not documentation of code — it is a statement of intent, goals, boundaries, and constraints that code must satisfy. Policies define what must be true and why without prescribing specific implementations. Dense prose that makes requisites and boundaries clear. Never describe current state, specific tools, exact commands, or implementation details — those belong in code. A good policy survives complete reimplementation of the system it governs. Policies live in CLAUDE.md or as NixOS assertions, never in separate docs files — separated policy documents rot because they are out of the path of work.
</policy_documentation>

<format>
Dense prose over bullet lists. No filler phrases. No "This document describes..." preambles. Start with the content. Use headings only when sections are truly distinct. Markdown only. No generated badges, no status indicators that need updating.
</format>
