# NestJS / Node.js backend patterns — stack-adaptive entry

Preloaded into the `nestjs-backend-engineer` sub-agent. Provides a dispatch table from project recon to per-stack pattern files, plus universal principles applied across all stacks.

## How to use

1. **Recon first.** Run the script [recon.js](recon.js) — `node ~/.claude/skills/mainframe/skills/nestjs-backend-patterns/recon.js [project_root]` — for deterministic parse of `package.json` + tsconfig + lockfile. Manual fallback per [recon.md](recon.md) when the script is unavailable.
2. **Apply universal principles** (below) — they hold regardless of stack.
3. **Dispatch by recon outcome** — read the relevant supporting file(s) from the table below. Do NOT pre-read files irrelevant to the recon outcome (token discipline).
4. **For endpoint-specific situational concerns** (idempotency, pagination, rate limiting, health probes, config-from-env) — consult [api-conventions.md](api-conventions.md) when the concern is in scope.
5. **Test** per [testing.md](testing.md) — the 4-scenario contract for every endpoint is non-negotiable.

## Universal principles (apply across stacks)

These hold regardless of framework / ORM / validation choice. Cross-reference the umbrella CLAUDE.md rules (CQS, debug residue, marker bans, etc.) — they apply here too, not duplicated.

### The server is canonical — authority, state, computed values

Validation of inbound request data at the trust boundary is mandatory; that rule lives in the umbrella `CLAUDE.md` Engineering practices ("Trust framework and type-system guarantees": "data at system boundaries… is untrusted and must be validated"). Apply it. This bullet adds the **authority half** beyond schema validation:

- **Authorization on every protected endpoint, server-checked** against actual tenant + role from JWT. Per OWASP Authorization Cheat Sheet: "Access control checks must be performed server-side… client-side checks may be permissible for improving the user experience, they should never be the decisive factor". Guards / decorators alone are not enough for high-stakes operations — re-check ownership in the service layer.
- **Business state transitions controlled by the server.** Status flow (e.g. `draft → submitted → approved`) is a whitelist defined and enforced in the service layer. Reject unauthorised transitions there, not at the controller.
- **Computed and derived values come from the server.** Totals, percentages, aggregate counts, computed prices, derived statuses — recompute server-side. Never accept these as input fields even if the client computed them.
- **Related-resource IDs are ownership-verified server-side.** When a request body contains `machineId`, `jobId`, etc., load the row server-side and check ownership against the JWT tenant before any operation. The client cannot be trusted to send only IDs it owns.
- **Client-side validation is a UX accelerator only.** Per MDN: "Never trust data passed to your server from the client. Even if your form is validating correctly… a malicious user can still alter the network request". Reproduce all schema and business checks server-side regardless of what the client form did.

### Layer split

`controller` (HTTP orchestration) → `service` (business logic) → `repository` (data access) → `schemas / DTOs` (validation boundaries) → `utils` (pure helpers). Names map to framework: NestJS `Controller`/`Service`/`@InjectRepository`, Express/Fastify `router`/`service`/`repo`. Business logic NEVER lives in HTTP handlers.

### Tenant identity is JWT-sourced

`orgId` / `tenantId` comes from the JWT claim, set on every protected request. Endpoints that accept it from the request body are a privilege-escalation pattern — reject at the schema level. Fallback `req.body.organization_id ?? 0` is forbidden. See [multitenancy.md](multitenancy.md) for `AsyncLocalStorage` propagation pattern.

### Audit trail on state-changing operations

Every CRUD + status-transition on a business entity emits an audit event with `orgId`, `actorUserId`, `action`, `entityType`, `entityId`, `newValues` (omit secrets). Append-only store, never updated. Use a structured `auditLog.record(...)` helper, not ad-hoc log lines.

### Structured logging + tracing

`pino` logger per module; bind request-scoped context once per request (`requestId`, `userId`, `orgId`). OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation for the framework + ORM. Logs carry `traceId` via `pino-opentelemetry-transport` so backend joins logs + traces. Never log raw request bodies — whitelist fields. See [observability.md](observability.md).

### Typed exception handling

Throw framework exceptions (`BadRequestException`, `NotFoundException`, `ConflictException` in NestJS; `httpErrors.Conflict` in Fastify; or custom domain errors caught by error filter). Never `catch (e)` and swallow. Domain errors → mapped to HTTP at the framework boundary, never raw ORM errors leaked.

### Eager loading discipline

The N+1 query problem is the prime backend regression. List endpoints MUST pre-load relationships used by the response. TypeORM: `relations: { ... }` (avoid `eager: true` on entity); Prisma: `include` (avoid deep nested chains); Drizzle: `with: { ... }` relations API. See per-ORM files.

### Response envelope unification

Paginated list responses: one consistent envelope shape across the API surface, e.g. `{ items: [...], total: N, page: N, perPage: N, hasMore: bool }`. NOT a different shape per resource. Backward-compat aliases acceptable only during documented migration.

### HTTP status codes

`POST` create → `201 Created`. `POST` state-transition → `200 OK`. `DELETE` → `204 No Content`. `PUT` / `PATCH` → `200 OK` with body. `409 Conflict` for unique violations (idempotency, race losers). `422 Unprocessable Entity` for business-rule violation (semantically valid input, but rule says no).

### Bulk endpoints have hard limits

Any endpoint that accepts an array of IDs / objects MUST cap input size — `if (items.length > N) throw new BadRequestException("too many items")`. Typical N: 50-100. Unbounded bulk endpoints are DoS vectors.

### TypeScript strict mode is non-negotiable

`strict: true` is the floor. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is the high-value addition. See [typescript.md](typescript.md). `any` / `as` cast without runtime validation / `@ts-ignore` are banned per umbrella CLAUDE.md.

## Out of scope

- Data pipelines (ETL, transform large datasets) — separate `data-engineer` role.
- Full ML serving stacks — separate `ml-engineer` role.
- Infrastructure ownership (Kubernetes operators, full IaC) — separate `devops-engineer` role. Backend engineer reads Dockerfile / CI config, doesn't own them.
- React / Vue / Next.js frontend — separate `frontend-engineer` role (future).
