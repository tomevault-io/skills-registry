# Prototype Roadmap Planner Skill

This skill reads a prototype GDD and generates a detailed implementation roadmap. It extracts implementation phases from the GDD, breaks down each phase into concrete tasks, and creates a day-by-day or hour-by-hour development plan for rapid prototyping.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Says "create roadmap for prototype"
- Asks "plan implementation for prototype"
- Wants to break down prototype into actionable tasks
- Has a prototype GDD and needs a development plan
- Says "what's my implementation plan?" or "what should I build first?"
- Wants a day-by-day breakdown of prototype work

---

## Core Principle

**Roadmaps turn design into action**:
- ✅ Extract implementation phases from prototype GDD
- ✅ Break each phase into concrete, testable tasks
- ✅ Create hour-by-hour or day-by-day timeline
- ✅ Define clear deliverables and test criteria for each phase
- ✅ Prioritize tasks to get playable core loop as fast as possible
- ✅ Roadmap is actionable, not abstract

---

## Visible-First Ordering Philosophy

**Build what you can SEE before what you can't.**

Traditional development often goes: Data → Systems → Features → UI. For prototypes, **invert this**:

```
VISIBLE-FIRST ORDER:
1. Visual elements (sprites, scenes, UI) ← See it first
2. Player interaction (input, feedback)  ← Feel it second
3. Core systems (logic, rules)           ← Make it work
4. Data structures (resources, configs)  ← Refine later
5. Polish (juice, effects)               ← Last
```

**Why Visible-First?**
- **Observable progress**: Seeing sprites move on screen motivates more than seeing console logs
- **Early feedback**: Spot design problems when you can see the game, not just read data
- **Testable sooner**: Playtest with placeholder logic, not placeholder visuals
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Build only the systems you actually need for what you see

**Example - Grid Combat:**

❌ Traditional Order (invisible progress):
1. Create grid data structure
2. Create pathfinding algorithm
3. Create unit stats system
4. Create UI to display it all
5. Finally see something

✅ Visible-First Order (observable progress):
1. Create grid visual (TileMap or sprites) ← See the board
2. Create unit sprites that can be placed ← See the pieces
3. Create click-to-select, click-to-move  ← Feel interaction
4. Add pathfinding for valid moves        ← Make it smart
5. Add stats and damage calculation       ← Make it meaningful

**At each step, you can SEE and FEEL progress.**

### Ordering Rules

1. **Scenes before scripts**: Create the visual scene structure first, add behavior second
2. **Sprites before data**: Use placeholder sprites immediately, define stat Resources later
3. **Hardcode before configure**: Hardcode values to get it working, extract to data files later
4. **Input before logic**: Get player clicking/pressing first, add game rules second
5. **Feedback before polish**: Show that something happened (even ugly), make it pretty later

### Dependency Mapping (Visible-First)

When mapping task dependencies, follow this order:

```
Phase 1: Core Visuals
├── Scene structure (Main.tscn, Game.tscn)
├── Player/unit sprites visible
├── Basic camera/viewport
└── Placeholder UI elements

Phase 2: Core Interaction
├── Input handling (click, WASD)
├── Visual feedback (selection, movement)
├── State changes visible (health bars, etc.)
└── Basic sound effects (optional)

Phase 3: Core Systems
├── Game logic (turn order, combat rules)
├── Data integration (stats affect outcomes)
├── Win/lose conditions
└── State management

Phase 4: Data & Balance
├── Extract hardcoded values to Resources
├── Create data files (JSON, .tres)
├── Balance pass (tune numbers)
└── Configuration systems

Phase 5: Polish
├── Animations and transitions
├── Juice (screenshake, particles)
├── UI polish
└── Audio polish
```

---

**END OF ROADMAP**

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this roadmap
2. Set up development environment
3. Start Phase 1, Task 1.1
4. Test frequently, adjust timeline as needed
```

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Prototype GDD

1. **Find the prototype GDD:**
   - Look for `docs/*prototype-gdd*.md` or ask user for path
   - Read the entire GDD

2. **Extract key information:**
   - Timeline (weekend/week/month from GDD)
   - Critical questions being tested
   - Implementation phases (from "Implementation Phases" section)
   - Each phase's goal, deliverables, test criteria
   - Content scope (units, mechanics, etc.)
   - Risk mitigation plans
   - Success metrics

---

### Step 2: Break Down Each Phase into Tasks

**For each implementation phase in the GDD:**

1. **Extract phase metadata:**
   - Phase name and timeline (e.g., "Day 1, Morning - 4h")
   - Goal statement
   - Deliverables list
   - Test criteria

2. **Infer concrete tasks from deliverables:**
   - Each deliverable becomes 1-3 tasks
   - Tasks should be 1-3 hours each (small enough to track progress)
   - Tasks should have clear acceptance criteria

**Example:**
GDD Deliverable: "WASD movement, one weapon, enemy spawning"

Becomes tasks:
- Task 1.1: Player Character with WASD Movement (2h)
- Task 1.2: Basic Weapon Auto-Fire System (1.5h)
- Task 1.3: Enemy Spawner and Basic Enemy (1.5h)

3. **Define acceptance criteria:**
   - What specific behaviors must work
   - How to test it
   - Observable success conditions

**Example:**
Task 1.1: Player Character with WASD Movement
Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Player sprite appears in center of screen
- [ ] W/A/S/D keys move player in correct directions
- [ ] Movement speed is 200 px/s
- [ ] Player cannot move off-screen

4. **Identify file paths:**
   - Where will code live (scripts/player/player.gd)
   - What scenes to create (scenes/player/Player.tscn)
   - Based on project structure and GDD organization

5. **Map dependencies (Visible-First):**
   - Which tasks must complete before others
   - Follow visible-first order: visuals → interaction → systems → data → polish
   - Prioritize tasks that produce observable results early

---

### Step 3: Create Critical Path

**Identify the shortest path to playable core loop:**
- Which tasks MUST complete to test the core mechanic?
- What's the absolute minimum to get "one round" working?
- Usually 3-5 tasks from Phase 1

**Output as "Quick Start" section:**
```
Critical Path to Playable Core Loop:
1. Player movement (Task 1.1)
2. Enemy spawning (Task 1.3)
3. Basic combat (Task 1.2)
Estimated time to playable: 5 hours
```

---

### Step 4: Generate Daily Schedule

**For short timelines (weekend/week):**
- Break phases into day-by-day chunks
- Assign tasks to morning/afternoon blocks
- Set end-of-day goals (deliverables)

**Example for weekend timeline:**
```
Day 1:
- Morning: Phase 1 (Core Loop Foundation)
- Afternoon: Phase 2 (Economy System)
End of Day Goal: Can place units and earn gold

Day 2:
- Morning: Phase 3 (Full Content)
- Afternoon: Phase 4 (Wave Progression)
End of Day Goal: Full 10-wave game loop works

Day 3:
- All day: Phase 5 (Polish & Juice)
End of Day Goal: Prototype ready for playtesting
```

---

### Step 5: Extract Content Checklist

**From GDD's "Content Scope" section:**
- List all units/enemies/items to create
- Extract stats and attributes
- Create checklist format

**Example:**
```
Content Checklist:
- [ ] Goblin (15g, 30 HP, 5 ATK)
- [ ] Skeleton (25g, 40 HP, 8 ATK)
- [ ] Warrior Hero (50 HP, 10 ATK, 20g drop)
```

---

### Step 6: Map Risk Mitigation to Tasks

**From GDD's "Risk Mitigation" section:**
- Each risk becomes potential task
- Mitigation = proactive task (do during normal dev)
- Fallback = conditional task (do if risk occurs)

**Example:**
```
Risk: Auto-battle too fast/confusing
Mitigation Task: Add damage numbers and 1-2s combat pacing (Phase 5, Task 5.2)
Fallback Task: Add "Pause" button during combat (conditional - if playtest reveals issue)
```

---

### Step 7: Save Roadmap

**Save to:** `docs/[game-name]-prototype-roadmap.md`

**Output to user:**
```
Created prototype roadmap with:
- [X] phases over [timeline]
- [X] concrete tasks
- Day-by-day schedule
- Critical path to playable in [X] hours

Next steps:
1. Review roadmap: docs/[game]-prototype-roadmap.md
2. Set up dev environment
3. Start Phase 1, Task 1.1
4. Test after each task, track progress
```

---

## Example Interaction

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing roadmap:

**Ordering & Structure:**
- ✅ Follows visible-first ordering (visuals → interaction → systems → data → polish)
- ✅ Early tasks produce observable results (not invisible infrastructure)
- ✅ All phases from GDD are included
- ✅ Critical path identified (shortest route to playable)

**Task Quality:**
- ✅ Each task uses 5-part format (What, How, Acceptance, Files, Hardcoded Values)
- ✅ Tasks are 1-3 hours each (trackable progress)
- ✅ Each phase broken into concrete, testable tasks
- ✅ Detail level is actionable but not over-specified
- ✅ Hardcoded values listed (to extract to data later)

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Daily schedule created for timeline
- ✅ All deliverables from GDD mapped to tasks
- ✅ Test criteria from GDD included in checkpoints
- ✅ Content checklist extracted from GDD scope
- ✅ Risk mitigation mapped to tasks

---

## Key Principles

**DO:**
- ✅ **Visible-first ordering**: Scenes → Interaction → Systems → Data → Polish
- ✅ Extract phases directly from GDD (don't invent new structure)
- ✅ Break deliverables into concrete, actionable tasks
- ✅ Include specific file paths and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Use 5-part task format: What, How, Acceptance, Files, Hardcoded Values
- ✅ Create testable checkpoints after each phase
- ✅ Identify critical path to playable core loop
- ✅ Map risks to mitigation tasks
- ✅ Hardcode values first, extract to Resources later

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Start with data structures before visuals (invisible progress)
- ❌ Build systems before you can see them working
- ❌ Add tasks not related to GDD deliverables
- ❌ Make tasks too large (>3 hours is too big)
- ❌ Skip test criteria or acceptance criteria
- ❌ Ignore dependencies between tasks
- ❌ Create vague tasks ("make it better")
- ❌ Over-specify tasks (save code details for implementation)
- ❌ Assume file structure (use project's actual structure)

---

## Task Breakdown Guidelines

### From GDD Deliverable to Tasks

**GDD says:** "WASD movement, one weapon, enemy spawning"

**Becomes:**
1. **Task: Player Character Setup**
   - Create Player.tscn scene
   - Create player.gd script with CharacterBody2D
   - Implement WASD input handling
   - Set movement speed to 200 px/s
   - Test: Player moves in all 4 directions

2. **Task: Basic Weapon System**
   - Create Weapon.gd script
   - Implement auto-fire timer
   - Spawn projectiles on timer tick
   - Test: Weapon fires automatically every second

3. **Task: Enemy Spawner**
   - Create Enemy.tscn scene
   - Create spawner.gd script
   - Spawn enemy every 3 seconds
   - Test: Enemies appear and move toward player

### Task Size Guidelines

**Good task sizes:**
- 1-3 hours of focused work
- Single responsibility (one system or feature)
- Testable in isolation
- Clear done criteria

**Too large:**
- "Implement combat system" (4-8 hours, multiple systems)
- Split into: damage calculation, health system, hit detection

**Too small:**
- "Add constant for move speed" (<15 min)
- Combine with larger task

---

## Feature Description Detail Level

Each task in the roadmap needs enough detail to be **actionable without ambiguity**, but not so much that it becomes a full specification. Use this framework:

### The 5-Part Task Description

Every task description should include these five elements:

```markdown
#### Task X.Y: [Clear Action Verb] [Specific Thing]

**What:** One sentence describing the visible/testable outcome.

**How:** 3-5 bullet points of implementation steps.

**Acceptance:** 2-4 checkbox criteria that prove it works.

**Files:** List of files to create or modify.

**Hardcoded Values:** Any magic numbers to use (extract to data later).
```

### Detail Level Examples

#### Too Vague (Unusable)
```markdown
#### Task 1.1: Add player movement
Create player movement system.
```
❌ What kind of movement? Grid? Free? How fast? What input?

#### Too Detailed (Over-specified)
```markdown
#### Task 1.1: Add player movement
Create a CharacterBody2D-based player controller using the
built-in input map system. The player should use a state
machine with Idle, Walking, and Running states. Movement
should use velocity-based physics with acceleration of
800 px/s² and deceleration of 1200 px/s². Maximum walk
speed is 150 px/s and run speed is 280 px/s when holding
Shift. Implement 8-directional movement with diagonal
normalization. Add dust particles when changing direction...
```
❌ This is a specification, not a roadmap task. Save this for implementation.

#### Just Right (Actionable)
```markdown
#### Task 1.1: Player Grid Movement

**What:** Player character moves between grid tiles using arrow keys/WASD.

**How:**
- Create Player.tscn with Sprite2D and CollisionShape2D
- Add player.gd with input handling
- Move one tile per keypress (no diagonal for now)
- Animate tween between tiles (0.2s duration)

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] Player sprite visible on grid
- [ ] Arrow keys move player one tile in pressed direction
- [ ] Player cannot move outside grid boundaries
- [ ] Movement has smooth tween animation

**Files:**
- `scenes/player/Player.tscn`
- `scripts/player/player.gd`

**Hardcoded Values:**
- Grid size: 64x64 pixels per tile
- Movement duration: 0.2 seconds
- Grid bounds: 12x12 tiles
```
✅ Clear what to build, how to approach it, how to test it, specific enough to start immediately.

### Detail Level by Task Type

#### Visual/Scene Tasks (High Visual Detail)
Focus on: What it looks like, where things are positioned, placeholder assets to use

```markdown
#### Task 2.1: Combat Grid Display

**What:** 12x12 grid visible in center of screen with distinct tiles.

**How:**
- Create CombatGrid.tscn with TileMapLayer
- Use placeholder tile (64x64 colored squares)
- Light tiles for walkable, dark for obstacles
- Center grid in viewport (1920x1080)

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] Grid renders 12x12 tiles
- [ ] Grid is centered on screen
- [ ] Walkable vs obstacle tiles visually distinct
- [ ] Grid scale appropriate (fills ~60% of screen width)

**Hardcoded Values:**
- Tile size: 64x64 pixels
- Walkable color: #4a5568
- Obstacle color: #1a202c
```

#### Interaction Tasks (High Behavior Detail)
Focus on: What input does, what feedback player sees

```markdown
#### Task 2.3: Unit Selection System

**What:** Click on friendly unit to select it, showing selection indicator.

**How:**
- Add Area2D with input detection to Unit.tscn
- Create selection_indicator.tscn (sprite or shader outline)
- Track currently_selected_unit in CombatManager
- Click empty tile or enemy = deselect

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] Clicking unit shows selection indicator
- [ ] Only one unit selected at a time
- [ ] Clicking elsewhere deselects
- [ ] Selected unit info appears in UI panel

**Hardcoded Values:**
- Selection indicator: Yellow outline, 2px
- Click detection radius: 32 pixels
```

#### System/Logic Tasks (High Rule Detail)
Focus on: Rules, formulas, edge cases

```markdown
#### Task 3.2: Attack Damage Calculation

**What:** When unit attacks, calculate and apply damage using stats.

**How:**
- Create damage_calculator.gd utility
- Formula: damage = attack_power - (defense / 2)
- Minimum damage: 1 (always deal at least 1)
- Apply damage to target's current_hp
- Emit signal when unit dies (hp <= 0)

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] Attack reduces target HP by calculated amount
- [ ] Defense reduces incoming damage
- [ ] Minimum 1 damage dealt even vs high defense
- [ ] Unit removed from grid when HP reaches 0

**Hardcoded Values:**
- Defense divisor: 2
- Minimum damage: 1
- Test values: Attacker (ATK 10) vs Defender (DEF 4) = 8 damage
```

#### Data/Resource Tasks (High Structure Detail)
Focus on: Data shape, field names, example values

```markdown
#### Task 4.1: Unit Stats Resource

**What:** Create Resource class to hold unit statistics.

**How:**
- Create UnitStats.gd extending Resource
- Export variables for: hp, attack, defense, move_range, attack_range
- Create 3 example .tres files (Soldier, Archer, Knight)
- Update Unit.tscn to use UnitStats resource

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] UnitStats resource class exists
- [ ] Can create .tres files with stats in editor
- [ ] Unit.tscn has exported UnitStats variable
- [ ] Changing .tres values affects unit behavior

**Example Data:**
- Soldier: HP 30, ATK 8, DEF 4, Move 3, Range 1
- Archer: HP 20, ATK 10, DEF 2, Move 3, Range 5
- Knight: HP 50, ATK 6, DEF 8, Move 2, Range 1
```

### What NOT to Include in Task Descriptions

❌ **Don't include:**
- Full code implementations (that's for coding time)
- Design justifications (that's in the GDD)
- Alternative approaches (pick one, note alternatives in comments if needed)
- Polish details (animations, particles, sounds - save for polish phase)
- Edge cases you haven't thought through yet

✅ **Do include:**
- Enough to start coding immediately
- Clear done criteria
- Specific numbers (even if they'll change later)
- File locations
- Dependencies on other tasks
