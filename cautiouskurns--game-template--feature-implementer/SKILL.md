# Feature Implementer Skill

This skill takes a feature specification from `docs/features/` and implements it fully, creating all necessary Godot scenes, GDScript files, resources, and configurations. **It ensures alignment with the overall game design vision** and provides detailed output on:
- **What was created** (files, systems, integrations)
- **What changed in the game** (gameplay impact, new mechanics)
- **What the player should now see** (visible differences, new UI, behaviors)
- **How to test the implementation** (step-by-step verification)

## Workflow Context

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Assigned Agent** | systems-dev, gameplay-dev, ui-dev |
| **Sprint Phase** | Phase B (Implementation) |
| **Directory Scope** | Agent's own directories |
| **Workflow Reference** | See `docs/agent-team-workflow.md` |

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Says "implement [feature-name]" or "implement the feature spec for [X]"
- Asks to "build [feature-name] from the spec"
- Says "create the implementation for [task-id]"
- Wants to "turn this spec into code"
- Says "implement docs/features/X.md"

## How to Use This Skill

**IMPORTANT: Always announce at the start that you are using the Feature Implementer skill.**

Example: "I'm using the **Feature Implementer** skill to implement the feature specification for [feature-name]."

---

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

**Step 1.1: Identify the Feature Spec**
- If user provides a feature name, search `docs/features/` for matching spec
- If user provides a file path, read that file directly
- If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify

**Step 1.2: Read the Feature Spec**
- Load the complete feature specification
- Parse all sections: Purpose, How It Works, Technical Implementation, etc.
- Identify acceptance criteria for validation

**Step 1.3: Read Game Design Documents**

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Always consult the overall game design before implementing.**

Search for and read these documents to ensure alignment:
- **Prototype GDD**: `docs/*prototype-gdd*.md` or `docs/*gdd*.md`
- **Vertical Slice GDD**: `docs/*vertical-slice*.md` (if exists)
- **Design Bible**: `docs/design-bible.md` (design pillars, player fantasy)
- **Systems Bible**: `docs/systems-bible.md` (technical architecture)
- **Roadmap**: `docs/*roadmap*.md` (context on where feature fits)

**Extract from game design docs:**
- Core design pillars (ensure feature supports them)
- Player fantasy (how feature reinforces the experience)
- Existing systems (how feature integrates)
- Quality bar (visual/audio standards)
- Scope boundaries (what's IN vs OUT)

**Step 1.4: Gather Project Context**
- Read existing scripts that this feature will integrate with
- Check for autoloads in `project.godot`
- Review existing scene structures in `scenes/`
- Understand signal patterns used in the project
- Look for related features already implemented

**Step 1.5: Identify Dependencies**
- Check if dependency features are implemented
- If dependencies missing, warn user and ask how to proceed
- List what systems this feature will connect to

---

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning

**Step 2.1: Design Alignment Check**

Before planning implementation, verify alignment with game design:

```markdown
## Design Alignment Check

### Design Pillars Support
- **[Pillar 1]:** How this feature supports it: [explanation]
- **[Pillar 2]:** How this feature supports it: [explanation]

### Player Fantasy Reinforcement
- This feature reinforces the player fantasy by: [explanation]

### Scope Verification
- ✅ Feature is within vertical slice scope
- ✅ Not adding anything from "What's OUT" list
- ✅ Quality bar requirements understood

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **[Existing System 1]:** Integration approach: [description]
- **[Existing System 2]:** Integration approach: [description]
```

**Step 2.2: Create Implementation Plan**

Show user the implementation plan before writing code:

```markdown
## Implementation Plan for [Feature Name]

### Design Alignment
- Supports pillars: [list]
- Reinforces: [player fantasy element]

### Files to Create
1. `scenes/[category]/[feature].tscn` - Main scene
2. `scripts/[category]/[feature].gd` - Main script
3. `scripts/[category]/[helper].gd` - Helper scripts (if needed)
4. `data/[feature]/[config].json` - Data files (if needed)

### Files to Modify
1. `project.godot` - Add autoload (if needed)
2. `scripts/core/[existing].gd` - Add integration signals
3. `scenes/[existing].tscn` - Add node references

### Integration Points
- Connects to: [list of systems]
- Emits signals: [list of signals]
- Listens for: [list of signals]

### Implementation Order
1. Create data structures/classes
2. Create main script
3. Create scene
4. Wire up signals
5. Integrate with existing systems
6. Test basic functionality

Proceed with implementation?
```

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

---

### Phase 3: Implementation Execution

**Step 3.1: Create Directory Structure**
```
Ensure directories exist:
- scenes/[category]/
- scripts/[category]/
- data/[category]/ (if needed)
- resources/[category]/ (if needed)
```

**Step 3.2: Create Core Scripts**

Follow the Technical Implementation section from the spec:
- Create class definitions with proper `class_name`
- Add all exported properties from spec
- Implement all public methods defined in spec
- Add all signals from spec
- Include comprehensive comments

**Script Template:**
```gdscript
## [Brief description from spec]
## Part of: [Feature Name]
## Spec: docs/features/[spec-file].md
class_name FeatureName
extends [BaseClass]

# ===== SIGNALS =====
signal example_signal(param: Type)

# ===== EXPORTED PROPERTIES =====
@export var example_property: Type = default_value

# ===== INTERNAL STATE =====
var _internal_state: Type

# ===== LIFECYCLE =====
func _ready() -> void:
    _connect_signals()
    _initialize()

func _connect_signals() -> void:
    # Connect to other systems
    pass

func _initialize() -> void:
    # Setup initial state
    pass

# ===== PUBLIC API =====
func public_method() -> ReturnType:
    ## Description from spec
    pass

# ===== INTERNAL METHODS =====
func _internal_method() -> void:
    pass
```

**Step 3.3: Create Scenes**

Follow the Scene Structure section from the spec:
- Create .tscn file programmatically or describe structure
- Attach scripts to appropriate nodes
- Configure node properties as specified
- Set up UI layouts if applicable

**Step 3.4: Create Data Files**

If spec includes JSON/resource data:
- Create data files in `data/` directory
- Follow schema from spec exactly
- Include all entries defined in spec

**Step 3.5: Integration**

Connect to existing systems:
- Add signal connections
- Update autoloads if needed
- Modify `project.godot` if required
- Update existing scripts to emit/receive signals

---

### Phase 4: Implementation Report

**Generate a comprehensive report after implementation. This report should be detailed enough that anyone can understand what changed, what the player experiences, and how to verify the implementation works.**

```markdown
# Feature Implementation Report

**Feature:** [Feature Name]
**Spec File:** docs/features/[spec-file].md
**Implemented:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Implementer:** Claude Code (feature-implementer skill)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Style

Follow project conventions:
- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables
- Use `PascalCase` for class names
- Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- Add type hints to all parameters and return values
- Include doc comments for public methods

### Signal Patterns

Follow existing signal patterns in the project:
```gdscript
# Define signals at top of class
signal state_changed(old_state: State, new_state: State)

# Emit with all parameters
state_changed.emit(previous, current)

# Connect using callable syntax
other_node.state_changed.connect(_on_state_changed)
```

### Scene Organization

Follow project scene organization:
```
scenes/
├── combat/       # Combat-related scenes
├── ui/           # UI screens and components
├── menus/        # Menu screens
├── entities/     # Mech, enemy scenes
└── effects/      # Visual effects
```

### Script Organization

Follow project script organization:
```
scripts/
├── core/         # Core systems (autoloads)
├── combat/       # Combat logic
├── ui/           # UI scripts
├── data/         # Data loaders
├── entities/     # Entity scripts
└── effects/      # Effect scripts
```
