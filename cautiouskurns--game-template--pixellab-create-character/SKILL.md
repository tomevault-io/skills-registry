**Setting:** Dark Fantasy (Low Magic) - The Shattered Kingdoms
**Perspective:** Top-down (for combat grid) with "low top-down" or "high top-down" camera angles
**Tone:** Gritty, medieval, war-torn

**Character Categories & Recommended Sizes:**

## Interactive Workflow

### Phase 1: Character Concept

**Start by asking these questions:**

```
I'll help you create a new character using PixelLab! Let's define the concept:

**1. Character Role**
What type of character is this?
- [ ] Player Character / Companion
- [ ] Enemy (Standard)
- [ ] Enemy (Elite/Boss)
- [ ] NPC Soldier (recruitable)
- [ ] NPC (non-combat)
- [ ] Other: _______

**2. Character Description**
Describe the character's appearance in detail:
- What are they wearing? (armor type, clothing style)
- What weapons/equipment do they carry?
- Any distinctive features? (scars, hair color, pose)
- What kingdom/faction do they belong to?

Example: "Ironmark heavy infantry soldier in plate armor with tower shield and longsword, stern expression, military bearing"

**3. Kingdom/Faction Affiliation**
Which faction does this character belong to?
- [ ] Ironmark (military, honor-bound)
- [ ] Silvermere (merchant, wealthy)
- [ ] Thornwood (druidic, nature)
- [ ] Sunspire (magical, academic)
- [ ] Ashenvale (outcasts, corrupted)
- [ ] Bandits/Outlaws
- [ ] Neutral/Independent
```

**Wait for user response before proceeding.**

---

### Phase 2: Technical Specifications

**After receiving Phase 1 answers, ask:**

```
Great! Now let's define the technical specifications:

**4. Canvas Size**
Based on the character role, I recommend:
[Provide recommendation based on role from Phase 1]

What size would you like?
- [ ] 32px (small units, NPCs)
- [ ] 48px (standard units, companions)
- [ ] 64px (player character, elites)
- [ ] 96px (bosses, large creatures)
- [ ] 128px (very large, special cases)
- [ ] Custom: _______

**5. Directional Views**
How many directions should the sprite have?
- [ ] 4 directions (south, west, east, north) - simpler, NPCs
- [ ] 8 directions (includes diagonals) - combat units, player

**6. Camera Angle**
Which perspective?
- [ ] low top-down (Recommended - closer to ground, better for combat)
- [ ] high top-down (more bird's eye view)
- [ ] side (platformer style - NOT typical for Blood & Gold)
```

**Wait for user response before proceeding.**

---

### Phase 3: Art Style Settings

**After receiving Phase 2 answers, ask:**

```
Now let's set the art style to match Blood & Gold:

**7. Outline Style**
- [ ] single color black outline (Recommended - clean, readable)
- [ ] single color outline (colored outline)
- [ ] selective outline (outline only where needed)
- [ ] lineless (no outline - not recommended for Blood & Gold)

**8. Shading Complexity**
- [ ] flat shading (minimal shadows)
- [ ] basic shading (Recommended - good balance)
- [ ] medium shading (more depth)
- [ ] detailed shading (complex lighting)

**9. Detail Level**
- [ ] low detail (simpler, faster reads)
- [ ] medium detail (Recommended - balanced)
- [ ] high detail (intricate, for larger sprites)

**10. Body Proportions**
- [ ] default (standard proportions)
- [ ] heroic (slightly larger, heroic feel - good for player/companions)
- [ ] realistic_male / realistic_female (more realistic)
- [ ] Custom proportions (specify values)
```

**Wait for user response before proceeding.**

---

### Phase 4: Review & Generate

**After gathering all answers, present a summary:**

```
Here's the character I'll create:

**Character Summary:**
- Description: [Full description from Phase 1]
- Role: [Character role]
- Faction: [Kingdom/faction]

**Technical Settings:**

- View: [low/high top-down]

**Art Style:**
- Outline: [style]
- Shading: [complexity]
- Detail: [level]
- Proportions: [preset]

**Estimated Generation Time:** 2-3 minutes (4 directions) or 3-5 minutes (8 directions)

Ready to generate? [Yes / Modify settings]
```

---

### Phase 5: Execute Generation

**Once confirmed, call the PixelLab API:**

```gdscript
# Use the mcp__pixellab__create_character tool with these parameters:
{
  "description": "[Full character description]",
  "name": "[Character name for reference]",
  "size": [canvas size],
  "n_directions": [4 or 8],
  "view": "[low top-down / high top-down / side]",
  "outline": "[outline style]",
  "shading": "[shading level]",
  "detail": "[detail level]",
  "proportions": "{\"type\": \"preset\", \"name\": \"[preset name]\"}"
}
```

**After submission:**
```
Character creation job queued!

**Job Details:**
- Character ID: [ID from response]
- Status: Processing
- Estimated Time: 2-5 minutes

**Next Steps:**
1. The character will generate in the background
2. Use `/pixellab-check-status` or ask me to check on it
3. Once complete, you can download the sprite or add animations

**Tip:** While waiting, you can queue more characters or work on other tasks!
```

## Description Writing Guidelines

### Effective PixelLab Prompts

**DO Include:**
- Specific clothing/armor type (plate armor, leather tunic, robes)
- Weapon being held or visible
- Faction colors or identifying marks
- Pose or stance (combat ready, relaxed, aggressive)
- Key visual features (beard, helmet, cape)

**DON'T Include:**
- Backstory or personality (focus on VISUAL elements)
- Environmental details (background, location)
- Actions (walking, attacking - that's for animations)
- Overly long descriptions (keep under 200 words)

### Example Descriptions by Faction

**Ironmark Infantry:**
```
Ironmark heavy infantry soldier in steel plate armor with chainmail
underneath, carrying a tower shield emblazoned with iron fist emblem,
longsword at hip, military red cape, stern bearded face, combat stance
```

**Thornwood Ranger:**
```
Thornwood ranger in forest green leather armor with leaf patterns,
hooded cloak, longbow across back, quiver of arrows, wiry athletic
build, face partially hidden by hood, alert scouting pose
```

**Bandit Leader:**
```
Scarred bandit leader in mismatched leather and chain armor,
fur-lined cloak, dual short swords, eye patch over left eye,
menacing grin, confident aggressive stance
```

**Silvermere Merchant Guard:**
```
Silvermere merchant guild guard in purple and gold livery over
chainmail, ornate halberd, plumed helmet, clean well-maintained
equipment, professional at-attention pose
```

**Sunspire Battlemage:**
```
Sunspire battlemage in flowing arcane robes of deep blue with
golden runes, crystal-topped staff, magical energy around hands,
bald head with arcane tattoos, casting stance
```

## Validation Checklist

Before generating, verify:

- [ ] Description focuses on visual elements only
- [ ] Size is appropriate for character role
- [ ] Style settings match Blood & Gold aesthetic
- [ ] Faction colors are consistent with lore
- [ ] Proportions suit the character type
- [ ] Direction count matches intended use (4 for NPCs, 8 for combat)

---

## Post-Generation Workflow

**After character generates:**

1. **Check Status:**
   ```
   Use mcp__pixellab__get_character with the character_id to check completion
   ```

2. **Review Output:**
   - Verify all directions rendered correctly
   - Check style consistency
   - Confirm character reads well at game resolution

3. **Add Animations (if needed):**
   ```
   Use the pixellab-animate-character skill to add:
   - Idle animation (breathing-idle)
   - Walk cycle (walking-8-frames)
   - Attack animations (depends on weapon)
   - Death animation (falling-back-death)
   ```

4. **Download Assets:**
   ```
   The character response includes download URLs for:
   - Individual direction PNGs
   - Sprite sheet
   - ZIP with all assets
   ```

5. **Import to Godot:**
   - Save to `assets/sprites/characters/[faction]/[character_name]/`
   - Create AnimatedSprite2D or AnimationPlayer
   - Set up animation states

---

## Quick Generation (Skip Interactive)

If user provides all details upfront, skip the questions and generate directly:

**Example:**
```
User: "Create a 48px Ironmark knight with 8 directions"

Skip to Phase 5 with:
- description: "Ironmark knight in full plate armor, tower shield, longsword, red cape with iron fist emblem, heroic stance"
- name: "Ironmark Knight"
- size: 48
- n_directions: 8
- view: "low top-down"
- outline: "single color black outline"
- shading: "basic shading"
- detail: "medium detail"
- proportions: {"type": "preset", "name": "heroic"}
```

---

## Error Handling

**If generation fails:**
1. Check PixelLab service status
2. Verify description isn't too long (>500 chars can cause issues)
3. Try simplifying the description
4. Check subscription/credits status

**If style doesn't match:**
1. Regenerate with adjusted settings
2. Try different shading level
3. Modify description for clarity
4. Use reference to existing successful characters

---

## Example Invocations

User: "I need a new enemy type for the bandit camp"
User: "Create a character sprite for the Thornwood druid"
User: "Make a boss sprite for the Ironmark Knight Commander"
User: "Generate pixel art for the player character fighter class"
User: "I need soldier sprites for the recruitable infantry"

---

## Reference: Existing Project Characters

Check existing characters for style consistency:
```
Use mcp__pixellab__list_characters to see:
- Combat Mech (64x64, 8 directions) - reference for larger units
- Knight (48x48, 8 directions) - reference for standard combat units
- Cave Explorer (32x32, 4 directions) - reference for smaller NPCs
```

Match new characters to these established styles for visual consistency.
