# Create Feature Plan

Initialize a structured plan for feature development with phases, tasks, and tracking.

## When to Use

Use this when:
- Starting a complex feature requiring multiple steps
- Want to track progress through development phases
- Need to break down large features into manageable parts
- Working with worktrees and want integrated planning

## Usage

```
/create-plan <feature-name> [--template=TYPE]
```

**Arguments:**
- `feature-name` - Name of the feature (kebab-case)
- `--template` - Optional template type (feature, bugfix, refactor, migration)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Validate and Normalize Input

```bash
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Error: Feature name required"
  echo "Usage: /create-plan <feature-name> [--template=TYPE]"
  echo ""
  echo "Templates: feature (default), bugfix, refactor, migration"
  exit 1
fi

# Convert to kebab-case
FEATURE_NAME=$(echo "$1" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr '_' '-' | tr ' ' '-')

# Extract template type
TEMPLATE="feature"
if [[ "$2" == --template=* ]]; then
  TEMPLATE="${2#*=}"
fi

PLAN_DIR="plans/active/$FEATURE_NAME"
```

### Step 2: Check if Plan Already Exists

```bash
if [ -d "$PLAN_DIR" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Plan already exists at: $PLAN_DIR"
  read -p "Overwrite existing plan? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
  echo
  if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo "Plan creation cancelled"
    exit 1
  fi
  rm -rf "$PLAN_DIR"
fi
```

### Step 3: Create Plan Directory

```bash
mkdir -p "$PLAN_DIR"
echo "Creating plan at: $PLAN_DIR"
```

### Step 4: Generate Plan from Template

**Feature Template (Default):**

```bash
if [ "$TEMPLATE" == "feature" ]; then
  cat > "$PLAN_DIR/plan.md" <<'EOF'

echo "Created initial sub-plan: 01-research.md"
```

### Step 6: Link to Worktree (if exists)

if [ -d "$WORKTREE_PATH" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "📁 Linked to existing worktree: $WORKTREE_PATH"
fi
```

### Step 7: Output Success Message

```bash
echo ""
echo "✅ Plan created successfully!"
echo ""
echo "📋 Plan location: $PLAN_DIR/plan.md"
echo "📝 Template used: $TEMPLATE"
echo ""
echo "Next steps:"
echo "1. Edit $PLAN_DIR/plan.md to fill in details"
echo "2. Use /plan-status to track progress"
if [ ! -d "$WORKTREE_PATH" ]; then
  echo "3. Create worktree: /worktree-create $FEATURE_NAME"
fi
echo ""
echo "Phase management:"
echo "- Update phase status in plan.md frontmatter"
echo "- Create sub-plans for each phase (01-research.md, 02-design.md, etc.)"
```

## Example Usage

**Create feature plan:**
```bash
/create-plan user-authentication
```

**Create bugfix plan:**
```bash
/create-plan payment-failure --template=bugfix
```

**Create refactor plan:**
```bash
/create-plan api-modernization --template=refactor
```

## Plan Structure

```
plans/
└── active/
    └── feature-name/
        ├── plan.md              # Master plan
        ├── 01-research.md       # Phase 1 sub-plan
        ├── 02-design.md         # Phase 2 sub-plan
        ├── 03-implementation.md # Phase 3 sub-plan
        └── 04-testing.md        # Phase 4 sub-plan
```

## Best Practices

**Before Creating Plan:**
- Understand the feature requirements
- Know your success criteria
- Estimate rough timeline

**During Planning:**
- Break large features into 3-5 phases
- Each phase should be 1-5 days of work
- Include verification steps in each phase
- Document risks and dependencies

**Maintaining Plans:**
- Update status as you progress
- Add notes and decisions
- Track open questions
- Move completed plans to archive

## Integration with Worktrees

Plans and worktrees work together:

```bash
# Option 1: Create plan first
/create-plan user-auth
# Edit plan
/worktree-create user-auth

# Option 2: Create worktree first
/worktree-create user-auth
# Plan is auto-created
# Edit the generated plan
```

## Tips

**Phase Breakdown:**
- Research: 10-20% of time
- Design: 15-25% of time
- Implementation: 40-50% of time
- Testing: 20-30% of time

**Task Granularity:**
- Each task should be < 4 hours
- Checkboxes make progress visible
- Link to specific files/PRs

**Success Criteria:**
- Should be testable/verifiable
- Include non-functional requirements
- Think about edge cases
