# Agent Config Cleanup

Review, consolidate, and organize AI coding agent configuration and instruction files across four tools: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot (CLI agent and code review), and OpenCode.

## Reference Documents

Consult the reference files in this skill's `references/` directory for detailed information about each tool's file formats, precedence rules, and unique capabilities:

- `references/agent-instruction-files.md` -- CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, copilot-instructions.md, SKILL.md comparison
- `references/agent-config-files.md` -- settings.json, config.toml, opencode.json, VS Code settings comparison

Read these references before starting work. They contain tool-specific details about file precedence, loading behavior, and cross-tool compatibility that inform every decision in this workflow.

---

## Target Structure

The goal is a hub-and-spoke model: shared instructions in one canonical file, tool-specific configuration in each tool's hidden directory.

### Instruction files (the hub)

```text
repo/
+-- AGENTS.md                              # Single source of truth (all tools)
+-- CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md                 # Symlink for Claude Code
+-- .claude/
|   +-- rules/
|       +-- *.md                           # Claude-specific rules (auto-loaded)
+-- .github/
    +-- copilot-instructions.md            # Copilot repo-wide review rules
    +-- instructions/
        +-- *.instructions.md              # Copilot path-scoped rules
```

### Config files (the spokes)

```text
repo/
+-- .mcp.json                              # Shared MCP servers (Claude Code, OpenCode)
+-- opencode.json                          # OpenCode project config (if used)
+-- .claude/
|   +-- settings.json                      # Team-shared: permissions, hooks, env vars
|   +-- settings.local.json                # Personal: model, telemetry (gitignored)
+-- .codex/
    +-- config.toml                        # Codex project config (if used)
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Audit

Scan the repository for all known agent-related files.

#### Instruction files to check

- `AGENTS.md` (root and subdirectories)
- `AGENTS.override.md` (root and subdirectories)
- `CLAUDE.md` (root and subdirectories)
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `.claude/rules/*.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`
- `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`
- `.github/chatmodes/*.chatmode.md`
- `.github/agents/*.agent.md`

#### Config files to check

- `.claude/settings.json`
- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `.mcp.json`
- `.codex/config.toml`
- `opencode.json`

#### Also check

- **Symlinks:** Run `ls -la CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md` to detect symlinks and their targets.
- **Gitignore:** Verify `.claude/settings.local.json` is gitignored (Claude Code does this automatically, but confirm).
- **Project characteristics:** Note the primary languages, directory structure, build tools, and monorepo indicators. These inform AGENTS.md content and Copilot path-scoped instructions.

Report which files exist, which are missing, which are symlinks, and what each file contains at a high level.

### Phase 2: Analyze

Read each found file and categorize its contents into:

1. **Shared instructions** -- project overview, tech stack, commands, coding conventions that all tools should know
1. **Claude-specific instructions** -- MCP server usage hints, subagent patterns, `@import` references, Claude-only tool restrictions
1. **Copilot-specific instructions** -- code review rules, PR description conventions, `excludeAgent` scoping
1. **Tool config** -- permissions, hooks, model settings, environment variables, sandbox policies
1. **Personal config** -- settings that belong in gitignored files, not shared config
1. **Duplicated content** -- instructions repeated across multiple files
1. **Misplaced content** -- team settings in personal files or personal settings in team files

#### Settings split analysis (Claude Code)

For `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json`, specifically classify each setting:

**Belongs in settings.json (team-shared, committed):**

- `$schema` reference
- `permissions.allow` rules for team-standard tool patterns
- `permissions.deny` rules for protecting sensitive paths
- `hooks` definitions (pre/post tool use enforcement)
- `env` vars for team conventions (`attribution`, survey suppression, etc.)
- `attribution` settings

**Belongs in settings.local.json (personal, gitignored):**

- Model override env vars (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_TURNS`)
- Telemetry/privacy env vars (`DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING`)
- Personal MCP servers in `mcpServers`
- Personal permission overrides
- `spinnerTipsEnabled` and similar personal preferences
- Experimental settings being tested before proposing to the team

Note: Claude Code writes to `settings.local.json` by default when users change settings interactively. This means team-appropriate settings often end up in the local file and need to be moved to `settings.json`.

### Phase 3: Propose Changes

Present the user with a concrete plan before making any changes:

1. **New files** -- what will be created, with a summary of contents
1. **Content moves** -- what content is moving between files, with before/after locations
1. **Consolidations** -- duplicated content being merged into one location
1. **Symlinks** -- what symlinks will be created or updated
1. **Deletions** -- files being replaced by symlinks or removed
1. **Config split** -- settings moving between settings.json and settings.local.json

Show the proposed final file tree and get explicit user approval before proceeding.

#### Symlink strategy

Recommend `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md` (AGENTS.md is the real file) when:

- AGENTS.md already exists, or
- Starting fresh (AGENTS.md is the cross-tool standard), or
- The team uses multiple AI tools

Recommend keeping CLAUDE.md as the real file (no symlink) when:

- The team exclusively uses Claude Code and the user prefers the CLAUDE.md name
- CLAUDE.md has extensive Claude-specific `@import` references that other tools wouldn't understand

Follow whichever recommendation applies. The Phase 3 plan approval gives the user a chance to override the choice.

### Phase 4: Implement

Execute the approved plan in this order:

#### 4a. AGENTS.md

Create or update AGENTS.md with shared instructions consolidated from all sources. Structure with clear headings:

```markdown
# Project Name

## Overview

Brief project description and key architectural decisions.

## Development Environment

- Package manager and runtime versions
- Key commands: build, test, lint, dev server

## Code Conventions

- Language-specific patterns and preferences
- Error handling approach
- Testing conventions and location

## Git Workflow

- Branch naming and commit format
- Pre-commit requirements
```

**Keep it under 200 lines.** If more detail is needed, keep it in `.claude/rules/` files (Claude) or reference supporting docs.

**Do not include** code style rules that linters enforce (formatting, indentation). Those belong in `.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc`, etc.

#### 4b. CLAUDE.md symlink

```bash
# If AGENTS.md is the source of truth:
ln -sfn AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
```

If CLAUDE.md previously had Claude-specific content, extract those sections to `.claude/rules/` files before replacing with the symlink.

#### 4c. .claude/rules/ (Claude-specific)

Move Claude-specific instructions to focused rule files:

```text
.claude/rules/
+-- mcp-servers.md     # How to use project MCP servers
+-- testing.md         # Claude-specific test runner patterns
+-- security.md        # Paths to protect, secrets handling
```

Each file is auto-loaded alongside CLAUDE.md. Keep files focused on one topic.

Only create these if there are genuine Claude-specific instructions. Do not create empty rule files.

#### 4d. .claude/settings.json (team-shared)

Create or update with team-appropriate settings:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json",
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [],
    "deny": []
  }
}
```

Move team settings here from settings.local.json. Remove personal settings to settings.local.json.

#### 4e. .claude/settings.local.json (personal)

Move personal settings here from settings.json. Verify it is gitignored.

If settings.local.json does not exist and there are no personal settings to move, do not create an empty file.

#### 4f. .github/copilot-instructions.md

Create or update with Copilot-specific content. This file should NOT duplicate AGENTS.md. Instead, use the pointer pattern: a cross-reference to AGENTS.md plus Copilot-specific PR review rules.

```markdown
# GitHub Copilot Instructions

For full project conventions, see AGENTS.md in the repository root.

## PR Review

When reviewing pull requests, do not flag the following patterns as issues.
Each is an intentional project convention:

- **Convention name**: Brief explanation of why this is intentional.
```

**Keep concise.** GitHub recommends keeping instruction files short and putting the most important rules first. Start with a focused set of review rules and add more iteratively.

**The "do not flag" pattern.** The PR Review section documents project conventions that Copilot commonly misidentifies as issues during PR reviews. Each item uses the bold-key format (`**Convention name**: explanation`). To populate this section for an existing project:

1. Check the project's PR history for recurring false-positive Copilot review comments
1. Review AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and any existing code review documentation for conventions that an external reviewer might question
1. Look for intentional patterns that deviate from common defaults (e.g., non-standard error handling, unconventional file locations, domain-specific naming)
1. Start with 3-5 items and add more as Copilot flags new false positives over time

**Section heading.** Use `## PR Review` as the heading. Some repos use `## PR Review Checklist (CRITICAL)` or `## Code Review` -- all are acceptable. The key requirement is that PR review rules appear early in the file.

#### 4g. .github/instructions/\*.instructions.md (path-scoped)

Create path-scoped instruction files only when the project structure warrants them. Use Copilot's `applyTo` glob for file-type or directory scoping:

```markdown
---
applyTo: "src/frontend/**/*.tsx"
---

Use functional React components with hooks.
Prefer named exports over default exports.
```

Good candidates for path-scoped files:

- Distinct frontend/backend directories in a monorepo
- Multiple languages in the same repo (Go backend, TypeScript frontend)
- Test files with different conventions than source files
- Generated code directories that should be treated differently

Use `excludeAgent` to control whether instructions apply to the coding agent, code review, or both:

- `excludeAgent: copilot-code-review` -- coding agent only
- `excludeAgent: copilot-coding-agent` -- code review only
- Omit `excludeAgent` -- both

Do not create path-scoped files if the project has a flat structure or uniform conventions.

#### 4h. .codex/config.toml (if applicable)

Only create if the team uses Codex. Include team-appropriate defaults:

```toml
#:schema https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-schema.json

approval_policy = "on-request"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"

project_doc_fallback_filenames = ["CLAUDE.md"]
```

The `project_doc_fallback_filenames` line lets Codex fall back to CLAUDE.md when AGENTS.md is not present.
If CLAUDE.md is a symlink to AGENTS.md, omit `project_doc_fallback_filenames` to avoid Codex ingesting the same instructions twice.

#### 4i. opencode.json (if applicable)

Only create if the team uses OpenCode. Reference the instruction files:

```json
{
  "instructions": ["AGENTS.md"]
}
```

Add glob patterns for subdirectory AGENTS.md files in monorepos:

```json
{
  "instructions": ["AGENTS.md", "packages/*/AGENTS.md"]
}
```

### Phase 5: Verify

1. **Symlinks resolve correctly:**

   ```bash
   ls -la CLAUDE.md
   readlink CLAUDE.md
   ```

1. **No duplicated instructions** across AGENTS.md, copilot-instructions.md, and .claude/rules/

1. **Settings split is clean:**
   - settings.json has no personal/local settings
   - settings.local.json has no team-shared settings

1. **Gitignore** covers .claude/settings.local.json

1. **Show final file tree** of all agent-related files with a brief note on each file's purpose

1. **Report summary** as a table:

| File                    | Action          | Notes                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| `AGENTS.md`             | Created/Updated | Consolidated from X sources |
| `CLAUDE.md`             | Symlinked       | Points to AGENTS.md         |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Updated         | Moved N settings from local |
| ...                     | ...             | ...                         |

## Tool-Specific Behavior Reference

### Claude Code

- **Instruction precedence:** enterprise managed > project `CLAUDE.md` > `.claude/rules/*.md` > user `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` > subdirectory `CLAUDE.md`
- **Config precedence:** managed > user settings > project shared settings > project local settings > CLI flags
- **@imports:** CLAUDE.md supports `@path/to/file` syntax to pull in other files without copying content
- **.claude/rules/**: All `.md` files auto-loaded alongside CLAUDE.md. Use for Claude-specific instructions that shouldn't pollute the cross-tool AGENTS.md.
- **settings.local.json**: Auto-gitignored by Claude Code. Claude writes here by default when users change settings interactively.

### OpenAI Codex

- **Instruction loading:** Walks from project root down to cwd, reading AGENTS.md at each directory level, concatenating them in order
- **AGENTS.override.md:** Temporary overrides in any directory without modifying the base file. Unique to Codex.
- **Fallback filenames:** `project_doc_fallback_filenames` in config.toml makes Codex read CLAUDE.md or other files as instruction sources
- **32 KiB limit:** Combined AGENTS.md content is capped at `project_doc_max_bytes` (default 32 KiB). Raise in config.toml if needed.
- **Profiles:** Named config profiles (`[profiles.name]`) for switching between careful review and fast iteration. Unique to Codex.
- **Trust model:** Project .codex/config.toml only loads if the project is trusted.

### GitHub Copilot

- **Two agents:** The coding agent (CLI, VS Code) and the code review agent (PR reviews) both read .github/ files but can be targeted separately with `excludeAgent`.
- **Path-scoping:** `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` with `applyTo` globs offers file-type-level granularity that no other tool matches. This is Copilot's strongest unique feature.
- **Also reads:** AGENTS.md (root + subdirs) and CLAUDE.md (root) as fallbacks. If both AGENTS.md and copilot-instructions.md exist, Copilot uses both.
- **Keep short:** Copilot's review may not read full instruction files. Put critical rules first. Keep each file under ~1,000 lines.
- **Zero root footprint:** Everything lives in .github/, which already exists in most GitHub repos.

### OpenCode

- **Reads AGENTS.md natively.** If both AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md exist, only AGENTS.md is used.
- **Custom paths:** `instructions` array in opencode.json supports glob patterns (e.g., `packages/*/AGENTS.md`).
- **MCP servers:** Configured in opencode.json under `mcpServers`, same format as Claude Code's .mcp.json.
- **Provider-agnostic:** Supports Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, and local models. Model config is always personal, not team-shared.

---

## Error Handling

- **No agent config files exist at all:** Start fresh with the recommended structure. Analyze the project characteristics (languages, build tools, directory structure) to populate AGENTS.md.
- **CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md both exist with different content:** Merge them and ask the user which filename becomes the real file (recommend AGENTS.md). The other becomes a symlink.
- **settings.local.json has team settings:** Propose moving them to settings.json with a clear before/after diff.
- **settings.json has personal settings:** Propose moving them to settings.local.json.
- **Symlinks point to wrong targets:** Fix them after confirming with the user.
- **.github/ does not exist:** Create it. Assume the repository is hosted on GitHub.
- **Monorepo detected:** Suggest subdirectory AGENTS.md files and Copilot path-scoped instructions for each major package/module.
- **Large existing CLAUDE.md (over 200 lines):** Propose splitting into AGENTS.md (shared core) + .claude/rules/ (Claude-specific) + tool-specific files.
