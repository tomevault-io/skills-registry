# Commit

Create smart, context-aware git commits with conventional commit messages.

## Core Principle: Small Logical Chunks

Always prefer committing in the smallest logical chunks that are appropriate. Each commit should represent a single coherent change: one bug fix, one new function, one refactor, one documentation update, etc. Do not batch unrelated changes into a single commit.

**Why this matters:**

- Small commits are easier to review, revert, cherry-pick, and bisect.
- Each commit tells a clear story about _one_ thing that changed and why.
- When something breaks, small commits make it straightforward to identify the cause.

**What constitutes a "logical chunk":**

- A single bug fix (even if it touches multiple files)
- A single new feature or capability
- A refactor that moves or renames code without changing behavior
- A documentation update
- A configuration or tooling change
- Test additions or updates for a specific feature

**What does NOT belong in the same commit:**

- A bug fix mixed with an unrelated refactor
- A new feature combined with formatting changes to unrelated files
- Documentation updates bundled with code changes they do not describe

## Options

The user may provide these options inline:

- **--push**: Commit and push to remote after committing
- **--staged**: Commit only staged changes (ignore unstaged changes)
- **--plan**: Commit only the plan file
- **--all**: Stage and commit all changes (including untracked files)

## Workflow

### 1. Check for Changes

Run these commands in parallel to understand the current state:

```bash
# See all changed and untracked files
git status

# See staged changes
git diff --cached

# See unstaged changes
git diff

# See recent commit messages for style reference
git log --oneline -10
```

If there are no changes at all (no staged, unstaged, or untracked files), report that there is nothing to commit and stop.

### 2. Determine What to Commit

First, resolve which files are in scope using these rules in order:

1. **If `--staged` was specified**: Only staged files are in scope. If nothing is staged, report that and stop.
1. **If `--plan` was specified**: See the [Plan-Aware Commits](#plan-aware-commits) section.
1. **If `--all` was specified**: All changes (staged, unstaged, and untracked) are in scope, but still exclude likely secret files (see below).
1. **If there are staged changes and no unstaged changes or untracked files**: Staged files are in scope.
1. **If there are only unstaged changes and/or untracked files**: All of them are in scope.
1. **If there are both staged changes and either unstaged changes or untracked files**: Ask the user whether to use only staged changes or include everything.

Never stage files that likely contain secrets (`.env`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, etc.). If such files are detected among untracked or unstaged changes, warn the user and exclude them.

### 3. Analyze Changes and Identify Logical Chunks

Review the in-scope changes and group them into the smallest logical chunks. Each chunk should be a self-contained, coherent change that makes sense on its own.

**How to identify chunks:**

1. **Examine the diff**: Look at all in-scope file changes and understand what each change accomplishes.
1. **Group by purpose**: Changes that serve the same purpose belong together. For example, a new function and its tests are one chunk, but an unrelated formatting fix is a separate chunk.
1. **Check for independence**: If a change can be committed on its own without leaving the codebase in a broken or inconsistent state, it is a candidate for its own chunk.
1. **Respect dependencies**: If change B depends on change A, commit A first. They may still be separate chunks if they represent distinct logical steps.

**Common chunk patterns:**

- Adding a new file and updating an index or registry that references it: one chunk.
- Fixing a bug in one module and reformatting an unrelated module: two chunks.
- Renaming a function across multiple call sites: one chunk.
- Adding a feature, adding its tests, and updating documentation: one to three chunks depending on whether the docs describe only the new feature or also cover unrelated material.

**When there is only one logical chunk**: Proceed directly to step 4 with all in-scope changes.

**When there are multiple logical chunks**: Process each chunk sequentially, repeating steps 4 through 6 for each one. Stage only the files belonging to the current chunk before committing. Report the plan (number of commits and a brief description of each) before creating the first commit.

### 4. Analyze Recent Commit Style

Before generating a message, examine the output from `git log --oneline -10` to understand the repository's commit message conventions:

- Do commits use conventional commits format (`type: description`)?
- What types are used (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, etc.)?
- What is the typical length and style?
- Are issue numbers referenced?

Match the repository's existing style. If there is no clear convention, default to conventional commits format.

### 5. Generate Commit Message

Analyze the diff to generate a commit message:

1. **Determine the type**: Based on the nature of the changes:
   - `feat`: New functionality
   - `fix`: Bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation changes only
   - `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
   - `test`: Adding or updating tests
   - `chore`: Build, tooling, or maintenance changes
   - `style`: Formatting, whitespace, or cosmetic changes
1. **Write the description**: A concise summary (under 72 characters) focused on _why_ the change was made, not _what_ files changed.
1. **Add context when relevant**: Reference issue numbers if they appear in branch names (e.g., branch `fix/issue-42-login-bug` suggests `fixes #42`).

### 6. Create the Commit

All commits must be GPG signed. Use a HEREDOC for the commit message to ensure proper formatting:

```bash
git commit -S -m "$(
  cat << 'EOF'
type: description here
EOF
)"
```

CRITICAL: Never use `git commit --amend`. Always create a new commit. If a pre-commit hook fails, fix the issue, re-stage, and create a new commit.

### 7. Post-Commit

After a successful commit:

1. Run `git status` to verify success.
1. Report the commit hash and message.
1. **If `--push` was specified**: Push to the remote.

```bash
git push
```

If the branch has no upstream, use:

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

## Plan-Aware Commits

When the user mentions "commit the plan" or `--plan` is specified, or when plan files are detected among the changes, apply the rules in this section.

### Detecting Plan Files

Plan files live under `docs/plans/` and its subdirectories (`todo/`, `done/`). Look for Markdown files in these directories among the changed or untracked files.

### Plan Name Cleanup

Well-named plans follow the pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-meaningful-description.md`. Auto-generated names use nonsensical word combinations (e.g., `ethereal-booping-sunbeam.md`, `quizzical-imagining-cerf.md`).

**Every time a plan file is part of a commit, check its filename.** If the name lacks a datestamp prefix or uses a nonsensical auto-generated name:

1. Read the plan file to understand its content.
1. Choose a meaningful slug derived from the plan's title or purpose (e.g., `consolidate-ci-workflows`, `add-user-authentication`).
1. Rename the file to `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, using the current date for new plans or the date from the plan's title/content if one is stated.
1. Stage both the deletion of the old path and the addition of the new path.

If the filename already has a datestamp prefix and a meaningful description, leave it as-is.

### Moving Completed Plans

When committing code changes alongside a plan file, or when all the work described in a plan is being committed:

1. Check whether the plan's work is complete. Indicators: the branch is being finalized, the user says the work is done, or the commit represents the last piece of the plan.
1. If the work is complete, apply [Plan Name Cleanup](#plan-name-cleanup) first (if needed), so any rename happens before the move.
1. Move the (possibly renamed) plan file to `docs/plans/done/` (creating the directory if it does not exist). If both a rename and a move apply, perform a single `git mv` from the original path directly to the final destination (e.g., `docs/plans/done/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`).
1. If the plan is currently in `docs/plans/todo/`, the move goes from `todo/` to `done/`.
1. If the plan is in the `docs/plans/` root, the move goes from there to `done/`.
1. Stage the rename (if any) and the file move together as part of the commit.

Do not move a plan to `done/` if the work is only partially complete. Plans for work still in progress should stay in `docs/plans/todo/` or the `docs/plans/` root.

### "Commit the plan"

Commit only the plan file(s):

1. Apply [Plan Name Cleanup](#plan-name-cleanup) first.
1. Apply [Moving Completed Plans](#moving-completed-plans) if the plan's work is fully complete.
1. Stage only the plan file(s), including any renames or moves.
1. Generate a message like `docs: add plan for <meaningful-description>` where the description is derived from the plan's content or title.

### "Give the plan a meaningful name and commit"

1. Apply [Plan Name Cleanup](#plan-name-cleanup) (this request explicitly calls for it; the cleanup procedure handles staging).
1. Commit with an appropriate message.

### "Commit the plan as one commit, then the changes as another"

Create two sequential commits:

1. First commit: Apply [Plan Name Cleanup](#plan-name-cleanup) and [Moving Completed Plans](#moving-completed-plans). If both apply to the same plan file, perform a single `git mv` from the original path directly to the final `done/` destination (e.g., `docs/plans/done/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`). Stage and commit the plan file with a `docs:` message.
1. Second commit: Stage and commit the remaining changes with an appropriate message.

## Compound Commands

When the user gives compound instructions like "commit, then push" or "commit and push":

- Treat "and push" or "then push" as equivalent to `--push`.
- For other compound commands (e.g., "commit, then open a PR"), complete the commit first, then proceed with the next action.

## Error Handling

- **Nothing to commit**: Report cleanly, do not create an empty commit.
- **Pre-commit hook failure**: Read the hook output, fix the issue if possible, re-stage, and create a new commit (never amend).
- **Push failure**: Report the error. If it's a rejected push due to remote changes, suggest `git pull --rebase` first. Never force push unless the user explicitly requests it.
