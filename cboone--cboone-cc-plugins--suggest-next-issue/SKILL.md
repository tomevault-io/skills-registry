# Suggest Next Issue

Analyze open GitHub issues and recommend what to work on next.

## Options

The user may provide these options inline:

- **label filter**: Focus on issues with a specific label (e.g., "suggest next bug" or "suggest next issue --label enhancement")
- **milestone filter**: Focus on issues in a specific milestone
- **limit**: Number of recommendations (default: 5)
- **include PRs**: Also consider open PRs needing attention (reviews, conflicts, CI failures)

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Context

Run these commands to build a complete picture:

```bash
# Open issues (with details for analysis)
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels,assignees,createdAt,updatedAt,comments,milestone,body --limit 100

# Recently closed issues (understand momentum)
gh issue list --state closed --json number,title,labels,closedAt --limit 10 --sort updated

# Current branches/worktrees (what's already in progress)
git worktree list
git branch --list --format='%(refname:short)'

# Current authenticated user (for assignment detection)
gh api user --jq '.login'

# Project context
gh repo view --json description,defaultBranchRef
```

If the user specified `--label` or `--milestone`, add the corresponding `--label` or `--milestone` flag to `gh issue list`.

If the user specified `--include-prs`:

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,labels,createdAt,updatedAt,isDraft,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup
```

Also read the repo's README and any roadmap or project documentation to understand project goals.

### 2. Identify In-Progress Work

An issue is considered in progress if **any** of the following are true:

1. **Branch or worktree match**: A branch or worktree name contains the issue number (existing behavior)
1. **"in progress" label**: The issue has a label named "in progress" (case-insensitive match on the `labels` data already fetched in step 1)
1. **Assigned to current user**: The issue's `assignees` list (already fetched in step 1) includes the authenticated username from `gh api user`

Exclude in-progress issues from recommendations, but note them in the output as "already in progress" along with how each was detected (branch, label, assignment, or a combination).

### 3. Analyze Each Issue

Evaluate each open issue (that is not already in progress) on these signals:

| Signal              | Source                                                                 | Weight |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Priority labels** | Labels containing "bug", "critical", "urgent", "security"              | High   |
| **Dependencies**    | Issue body references to other issues (#N, "depends on", "blocked by") | High   |
| **Age**             | `createdAt` field                                                      | Medium |
| **Activity**        | Number of comments, `updatedAt` recency                                | Medium |
| **Effort**          | Issue body length/complexity, scope described                          | Low    |
| **Momentum fit**    | Similarity to recently closed issues                                   | Low    |

Dependency analysis: scan each issue body for references to other issues (`#N`, "depends on #N", "blocked by #N", "after #N"). Build a dependency graph to identify:

- Issues that **unblock** other open issues (high value)
- Issues that are **blocked** by other open issues (note the blocker)

### 4. Generate Recommendations

Present the top N issues (default 5) organized by category:

**Categories** (use whichever apply, skip empty categories):

- **Quick Wins**: Small, well-defined issues that can be resolved quickly
- **High Impact**: Important features, critical bugs, or heavily requested items
- **Unblocks Others**: Issues that other open issues depend on
- **Overdue**: Old issues that have been neglected (use judgment based on repo's typical issue age)

For each recommendation, include:

1. Issue number and title text (e.g., `#23 - Fix typo in help output`). Use the `title` field from the JSON, not the issue URL.
1. Labels and age
1. What it is: a brief summary of the issue (1-2 sentences distilled from the issue body, so the user understands the scope and substance without having to open the issue)
1. Why it's recommended (1-2 sentences with specific reasoning)
1. Suggested first steps or approach (1 sentence)
1. Blockers or considerations, if any

### 5. Summarize In-Progress Work

After recommendations, briefly list issues detected as in progress. For each, note how it was detected: branch/worktree, "in progress" label, assignment to current user, or a combination. This gives the user a complete picture of active work.

### 6. Offer to Start Work

End with an offer to create a worktree for the chosen issue via the `create-worktree-from-issue` skill. Example:

```text
Ready to start on one of these? Just say "start issue #N" or pick a number from the list.
```

## Example Output

```markdown
## Suggested Next Issues

### Quick Wins

1. **#23 - Fix typo in help output** (bug, 2 days old)
   The `--version` flag prints "verison" instead of "version" in the CLI help text.
   Small fix, keeps the issue count tidy.
   Start: Check the help string in the CLI entry point.

### High Impact

2. **#18 - Add dark mode support** (enhancement, 12 days old, 4 comments)
   Add a system-preference-aware dark color scheme with a manual toggle in the settings panel.
   Most-requested feature. Pairs well with the theme work done in #15.
   Start: Add CSS variables for color scheme, then add a toggle component.

3. **#11 - Add manage-plan skill** (enhancement, 1 day old)
   Create a skill that can list, rename, archive, and delete saved plans from within a session.
   High-frequency workflow pattern from session analysis.
   Start: Review existing plan-related commands and design the skill interface.

### Unblocks Others

4. **#7 - Refactor config loading** (enhancement, 20 days old)
   Replace the ad-hoc JSON parsing with a centralized, schema-validated config module that supports defaults and env overrides.
   Issues #8 and #9 both depend on the new config system.
   Start: Extract config into a dedicated module with typed schema.

### Overdue

5. **#3 - Update installation docs** (documentation, 45 days old)
   The install guide still references the old `curl | bash` method; needs updating for the new package manager install flow.
   Open since v0.2. Quick update needed for current install process.
   Start: Compare current docs against actual install steps.

**Already in progress:**

- #14 — feature/improve-notifications (branch)
- #16 — fix/search-pagination (branch, assigned)
- #21 — Add export feature (label: "in progress")
- #25 — Fix auth timeout (assigned)

Ready to start on one of these? Just say "start issue #N".
```

## Error Handling

- If `gh` is not authenticated, instruct the user to run `gh auth login`
- If no open issues exist, report that and suggest checking closed issues or creating new ones
- If all open issues are already in progress, report that and congratulate the user
