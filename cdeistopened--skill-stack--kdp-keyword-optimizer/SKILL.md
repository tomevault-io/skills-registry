# KDP Keyword Optimizer

Fill your 7 backend keyword slots with semantically relevant phrases that help Amazon's algorithm understand what your book is about and match it to reader searches.

## Purpose

Answer one question: **What 7 keyword phrases should go in my KDP backend slots?**

This skill does NOT cover categories (separate skill) or book descriptions (separate skill). Just the 7 keyword boxes.

## When to Use This Skill

- "What keywords should I use for my book?"
- "How do I fill out the KDP keyword boxes?"
- "My book isn't showing up in search results"
- "I need to optimize my book's metadata"
- "What keywords are my competitors using?"

**Not for:** Category selection, title/subtitle optimization, or book description writing.

## The New Reality: Semantic Keywords (2024+)

Amazon's algorithm has fundamentally changed:

### The A10 Algorithm
Amazon now prioritizes **semantic relevance** over exact keyword matches. The algorithm asks: "Does this book actually match the intent of the search?"

### Rufus AI
Amazon's AI shopping assistant scans reviews, themes, and metadata for **contextual matches**. If a reader asks Rufus for "a lighthearted beach read for a mom who needs a break," it won't look for those exact words—it will understand the concept.

### What This Means
- **Keyword stuffing is dead.** Cramming variations of the same word doesn't help.
- **Semantic phrases win.** Think reader intent, not exact matches.
- **Context matters.** Your keywords should describe the *experience* of your book.

---

## The 5-Step Method

### Step 1: Extract Core Themes

From your book description and content, identify:
- **Primary topic** (what is this book fundamentally about?)
- **Target reader** (who is this for?)
- **Reader outcome** (what will they gain?)
- **Emotional appeal** (how will they feel?)
- **Comparable works** (what's it similar to?)

**Example (fasting book):**
- Primary topic: Christian fasting, Lent, OMAD
- Target reader: Catholic, health-conscious, spiritually seeking
- Reader outcome: Closer to God, better health, discipline
- Emotional appeal: Peace, clarity, spiritual freedom
- Comparable works: "like Eat Fast Feast," "for fans of Jason Fung"

### Step 2: Generate Long-Tail Phrases

Combine your themes into 3-5 word phrases that a reader might search.

**Formula:** [Audience] + [Topic] + [Outcome/Format]

**Examples:**
- "catholic lent fasting guide"
- "christian intermittent fasting"
- "40 day spiritual fast"
- "one meal a day christian"
- "lenten devotional with fasting"

**Avoid:**
- Single words ("fasting")
- Duplicating your title words
- Generic terms ("book," "guide," "how to")
- Competitor names or trademarked terms

### Step 3: Check Character Limits

Each keyword slot allows **up to 50 characters**. You can use phrases, not just single words.

**Optimization tip:** Combine related terms in one slot to maximize coverage.

| Slot | Characters | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| 1 | 50 max | "catholic lent fasting guide spiritual discipline" |
| 2 | 50 max | "christian intermittent fasting one meal a day" |
| 3 | 50 max | "40 day lenten devotional prayer journal" |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Step 4: Validate Against Rules

Amazon has specific keyword rules. Your keywords must NOT include:

- [ ] Words already in your title or subtitle (duplicates hurt, not help)
- [ ] Competitor brand names or book titles
- [ ] Claims of bestseller status or rankings
- [ ] Misleading terms unrelated to your content
- [ ] Subjective claims ("best," "amazing")
- [ ] Temporary terms ("new," "on sale")
- [ ] Common misspellings (Amazon handles these)

**See:** `references/amazon-keyword-rules.md`

### Step 5: Fill All 7 Slots Strategically

Distribute your keywords across slots with intention:

| Slot | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| 1-2 | Primary topic + audience (highest priority searches) |
| 3-4 | Secondary themes + outcomes |
| 5-6 | Related topics + comparable works |
| 7 | Category-cementing keywords (see below) |

### Bonus: Category-Cementing Keywords

Some keywords can help Amazon place your book in additional categories automatically. Reserve 1-2 slots for keywords that match your target categories.

**Example:** If you want to appear in "Christian Living > Prayer," include keywords like "christian prayer devotional" in slot 7.

**Note:** This can also backfire—Amazon may remove you from categories if keywords don't match. Test carefully.

## Data Layer: Real Amazon Search Volumes

We have **DataForSEO Amazon API** integrated for real search volume data.

### Check Keyword Volumes

```bash
cd "/Users/charliedeist/Desktop/New Root Docs/Creative Intelligence Agency/skill-stack/amazon-publishing-optimization/data-layer"

# Single or multiple keywords
python3 keyword_volume.py "fasting books" "lent devotional" "catholic meditation"

# From a file
python3 keyword_volume.py -f keywords.txt
```

**Cost:** ~$0.01 per batch of up to 1000 keywords.

### Example Output

| Keyword | Monthly Searches |
|---------|------------------|
| meditation books | 2,580 |
| fasting books | 2,169 |
| mental toughness | 1,084 |
| lent devotional | 261 |
| catholic spiritual reading | 37 |

### Volume Interpretation

| Volume | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 1,000+ | High demand, competitive |
| 100-1,000 | Good niche opportunity |
| <100 | Very specific, low search volume |

**Use this data to prioritize slots 1-2 with your highest-volume relevant keywords.**

2. **Single-word keywords** - "fasting" is too broad; "catholic lent fasting guide" is specific
3. **Keyword stuffing** - Cramming synonyms doesn't help with semantic search
4. **Ignoring character limits** - Wasted space = wasted opportunity
5. **Set and forget** - Keywords should be refreshed every 3-6 months
