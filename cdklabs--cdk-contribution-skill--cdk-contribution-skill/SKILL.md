# CDK Contribution Workflow

Orchestrates specialized phases for AWS CDK contributions with human approval gates.

## MANDATORY: Present Workflow Overview FIRST

BEFORE doing ANY work, you MUST present the ASCII workflow diagram below, explain the process,
and wait for confirmation. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

Display this to the user:

CDK Contribution Workflow for Issue #<NUMBER>

I'll guide you through a structured process with human approval gates:

Key Points:
- Phase 1 (Analysis) runs first, then Phase 2 (Planning) runs after — sequential, not parallel
- You review and approve the plan before any code is written
- I pause for your input at critical decision points

Should we start? Yes | No
```

STOP and wait for user response. Do NOT proceed until the user confirms.

---

## Reference Files

**CRITICAL**: The reference files in the `references/` folder define the exact structure and content
of each deliverable per phase. You MUST read the relevant reference file BEFORE executing each phase:

| SOP | Phase | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `issue-analyst-sop.md` | 1 – Analysis | Issue analysis and classification |
| `solution-architect-sop.md` | 2 – Planning | Solution design and planning |
| `build-engineer-sop.md` | 3 – Build & Impl | Build environment setup |
| `implementation-specialist-sop.md` | 3 – Build & Impl | Code implementation |
| `test-engineer-sop.md` | 4 – Validation | Unit and integration testing |
| `quality-assurance-sop.md` | 4 – Validation | Lint, build, and quality checks |
| `documentation-specialist-sop.md` | 4 – Validation | README and docs updates |
| `security-reviewer-sop.md` | 5 – Self Review | Security review |
| `regression-reviewer-sop.md` | 5 – Self Review | Regression review |
| `review-report-generator-sop.md` | 5 – Self Review | Final review report synthesis |

Supplementary references: `debug-ci.md`, `integ-testing.md`

## Deliverables

Each phase MUST write its output to markdown files under `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/`:

| Phase   | Output file                                                    |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1 | `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/01-analysis.md`            |
| Phase 2 | `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/02-solution.md`            |
| Phase 3 | `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/03-build.md`               |
| Phase 4 | `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/test-results.md`           |
| Phase 4 | `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/quality-validation.md`     |
| Phase 4 | `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/pr.md`                     |
| Phase 4 | `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/04-validation.md`          |
| Phase 5 | `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/security-review.md`        |
| Phase 5 | `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/regression-review.md`      |
| Phase 5 | `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/05-review.md`              |

The subagent for each phase is responsible for writing its own deliverable file(s) before returning.
The orchestrator reads the file as the handoff input to the next phase.

### Deliverable ASCII Diagram Requirement

Every deliverable markdown file MUST include at least one ASCII diagram that visually summarises
the key findings or structure of that phase. Examples by phase:

- Phase 1: module/file dependency map or issue impact diagram
- Phase 2: solution architecture diagram showing files to change and their relationships
- Phase 3: branch/build setup flow
- Phase 4: test coverage map (unit vs integ, pass/fail)
- Phase 5: review findings summary (security + regression side by side)

Use plain ASCII box-and-arrow style. No emoji. Example:

```text
  +----------------+       +------------------+
  |  affected.ts   | ----> |  test/foo.test.ts |
  +----------------+       +------------------+
         |
         v
  +----------------+
  |  features.ts   |  (new feature flag)
  +----------------+
```

---

## Phase Execution Instructions

### When user says "Yes" to start:

IMPORTANT: Phase 1 and Phase 2 are SEQUENTIAL — Phase 2 depends on Phase 1's output.
Do NOT invoke them in parallel. Do NOT put them in the same subagent call.

**Step A — Invoke Phase 1 subagent:**

> **MANDATORY PRE-READ: Before executing this phase, you MUST read the instructions in `references/issue-analyst-sop.md`**
> **Do NOT proceed until you have read the file and understand the required deliverables.**
>
> Analyze the GitHub issue at <ISSUE_URL>.
>
> To fetch issue data, use the following priority order:
>
> 1. PRIMARY - gh CLI (preferred):
>    - `gh issue view <NUMBER> --repo aws/aws-cdk --json number,title,body,labels,comments,state`
>    - `gh issue view <NUMBER> --repo aws/aws-cdk --comments` for full comment thread
>    - `gh pr list --repo aws/aws-cdk --search "<issue number>" --json number,title,url` for linked PRs
>
> 2. FALLBACK - GitHub MCP server (only if gh CLI is unavailable or fails):
>    - Use MCP github tools with perPage: 3 to avoid token overflow
>
> Then explore the aws-cdk codebase to understand the affected module(s), existing patterns, test
> conventions, and any related code. Classify the issue type (bug, feature, docs, etc.).
> Produce a structured analysis: issue summary, affected files/modules, root cause or gap,
> relevant CDK patterns observed, and any constraints or risks.
>
> Write your full analysis to `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/01-analysis.md` before returning.

**Step B — WAIT for Phase 1 to complete, then read its output:**

Read `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/01-analysis.md` to confirm it was written successfully.

**Step C — Only AFTER Phase 1 is complete, invoke Phase 2 subagent:**

Pass the content of `01-analysis.md` as `relevant_context` to the Phase 2 subagent:

> **MANDATORY PRE-READ: Before executing this phase, you MUST read the instructions in `references/solution-architect-sop.md`**
> **Do NOT proceed until you have read the file and understand the required deliverables.**
>
> Using the analysis provided in the context, propose a concrete solution for the CDK
> contribution. Include: the implementation approach, which files need to change and how,
> required unit tests (what to test and why), required integ tests (which integ test file,
> what scenario to cover), and any breaking change considerations. Be specific about CDK
> patterns to follow.
>
> Write your full proposal to `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/02-solution.md` before returning.

Do NOT ask the user for input between Phase 1 and Phase 2 — proceed automatically.

## Phases 3-5 (after plan approval)

### Phase 3: Build & Implementation

**STEP 0 — READ SOPs (non-negotiable, do this FIRST):**

You MUST read BOTH of these files before ANY other action in this phase:
1. `references/build-engineer-sop.md` - provides instructions for the build phase
2. `references/implementation-specialist-sop.md` - provides instructions for the implementation phase

After reading, confirm you understand the required deliverables and procedures.

**STEP 1**

Before doing anything, present this summary to the user:

```text
PHASE 3: BUILD & IMPLEMENTATION
================================

Here's what I'm about to do:

  1. Create local branch   fix/issue-<NUMBER>-<slug>
  2. Sync with upstream    git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main
  3. Assess build need     read 02-solution.md to decide if yarn build is required
  4. Implement             apply all changes from the approved plan

Kicking off now...
```

Then proceed immediately without waiting for a response.

Steps (in order, no skipping):

1. Create a local PR branch named `fix/issue-<NUMBER>-<short-description>` from current HEAD
2. Sync with upstream main:
   - `git fetch upstream`
   - `git rebase upstream/main`
   - If no upstream remote exists: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk.git` then fetch
3. Assess whether a build is required:
   - Read `02-solution.md` — if changes touch generated code, L1 constructs, or cross-package
     imports that require compilation, build the affected package(s) with `yarn build`
   - If changes are purely in `.ts` source + tests with no codegen dependency, skip the build
     and go straight to implementation
   - Document the decision in `03-build.md`
4. Implement all changes from the approved plan in `02-solution.md`.
5. Write deliverable to `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/03-build.md` (with ASCII diagram)

### Phase 4: Parallel Validation

**STEP 0 — READ SOPs (non-negotiable, do this FIRST):**

You MUST read ALL THREE of these files before ANY other action in this phase:
1. `references/test-engineer-sop.md` - provides instructions for the testing subagent. Required deliverable: `test-results.md`.
2. `references/quality-assurance-sop.md` - provides instructions for the QA subagent. Required deliverable: `quality-validation.md`
3. `references/documentation-specialist-sop.md` - provides instructions for the documentation subagent. Required deliverable: `pr.md`

After reading, confirm you understand the required deliverables and procedures.

**STEP 1**

Before doing anything, present this summary to the user:

```text
PHASE 4: PARALLEL VALIDATION
==============================

Here's what I'm about to do (all three run in parallel):

  +---------------------+   +------------------+   +------+
  |        TEST         |   |        QA        |   | DOCS |
  +---------------------+   +------------------+   +------+
  | - Run unit tests    |   | yarn lint        |   | Check|
  |   for affected pkgs |   | yarn build (tsc) |   | README|
  | - Verify integ test |   | for affected     |   | needs|
  |   files exist and   |   | packages         |   | update|
  |   are well-formed   |   |                  |   |      |
  | - Dry-run integ     |   |                  |   |      |
  |   snapshot check    |   |                  |   |      |
  +---------------------+   +------------------+   +------+
        |                  |                  |
        +------------------+------------------+
                           |
                    04-validation.md

Kicking off now...
```

Then proceed immediately without waiting for a response.

Run all three as parallel subagents simultaneously. Do NOT wait for one to finish before starting the next.

- TEST subagent:
  - Run unit tests for all affected packages
  - Integ tests:
    1. Check if new or updated integ test files exist (compare against `02-solution.md` plan)
    2. If YES — run `yarn integ-runner --update-on-failed` on those files to deploy and regenerate snapshots
    3. If NO  — run `yarn integ-runner --update-on-failed` on the relevant module to confirm existing snapshots are intact and unchanged
- QA checks (lint, build)
- Documentation updates

When all three subagents have succeeded, summarize the testing, QA and documentation details in `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/04-validation.md`.

### Phase 5: Self Review

**STEP 0 — READ SOPs (non-negotiable, do this FIRST):**

You MUST read ALL THREE of these files before ANY other action in this phase:
1. `references/security-reviewer-sop.md` - provides instructions for the security review subagent. Required deliverable: `security-review.md`.
2. `references/regression-reviewer-sop.md` - provides instructions for the regression review subagent. Required deliverable: `regression-review.md`
3. `references/review-report-generator-sop.md` - provides instructions for creating the final review report. Required deliverable: `05-review.md`

After reading, confirm you understand the required deliverables and procedures.

**STEP 1**

Before doing anything, present this summary to the user:

```text
PHASE 5: SELF REVIEW
=====================

Here's what I'm about to do (both run in parallel):

  +------------------+     +------------------+
  |    SECURITY      |     |   REGRESSION     |
  |     REVIEW       |     |     REVIEW       |
  +------------------+     +------------------+
  | - IAM/policy     |     | - Snapshot diff  |
  |   impact check   |     | - API surface    |
  |   check          |     |   breaking change|
  | - Secrets/creds  |     | - Existing test  |
  |   exposure check |     |   coverage gaps  |
  | - CDK nag rules  |     | - CloudFormation |
  +------------------+     |   drift risk     |
           |               +------------------+
           +--------+--------+
                    |
             05-review.md
                    |
                    v
          SYNTHESIZE GO/NO-GO

Kicking off now...
```

Then proceed immediately without waiting for a response.

Run both as parallel subagents simultaneously. Do NOT wait for one to finish before starting the next.

Synthesize findings into a go/no-go report in `.kiro/contributions/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/05-review.md` and present to user before PR submission.

### Phase 6: PR Submission

After the user approves the go/no-go report, commit and create the PR.

**MANDATORY**: Every PR description body MUST end with this marker line:

```
[comment]: <> (by cdk-contribution-skill)
```

This is a hidden Markdown comment that identifies PRs created via this workflow.
It MUST be the last line of the PR body. Do NOT omit it.

---

## Prerequisites

- Local clone of `aws-cdk` repository
- Node.js v18+, Yarn
