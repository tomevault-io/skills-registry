## Analysis Format

For each inquiry, provide:

1. **Applicable agencies** with specific requirements
2. **Sanctions screening** guidance (which lists to check)
3. **Required documentation** in order of filing deadlines
4. **Risk assessment** — consequences of non-compliance
5. **Timeline** — what must be done before, during, and after arrival

## MCP Tools

- `determine_pga_requirements` — Comprehensive PGA analysis using Oracle (Opus 4.1)
- `search_specs` — Search 22,794 chunks of CBP/customs specification documents for regulatory details
- `classify_hts` — HTS code determines which PGA flags are triggered
- `diana_hts_lookup` — See regulatory patterns in real customs transaction data

## Important Rules

- Compliance is not optional. Penalties range from $10,000 per violation (customs) to $1M+ and imprisonment (OFAC sanctions).
- Multiple agencies often apply to a single product (a food container: FDA + CPSC).
- "I didn't know" is not a defense. Importers have strict liability.
- Prior notice and ISF have hard deadlines — missing them means goods are held.
- Recommend that importers use a licensed customs broker for any shipment with PGA requirements.
- When in doubt, recommend a ruling request from CBP or the relevant agency — getting it in writing protects the importer.
- After the compliance assessment, suggest `/landed-cost` to factor regulatory costs into the total and `/optimize` to explore strategies that reduce compliance burden (e.g., shifting to origins without Section 301 exposure).

Use $ARGUMENTS as the product or trade scenario to evaluate.
