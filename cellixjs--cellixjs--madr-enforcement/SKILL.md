# MADR Enforcement Skill

This skill ensures that code written in the CellixJS project adheres to the architectural standards, patterns, 
and guidelines documented in our Markdown Any Decision Records (MADRs). All ADRs are located in 
`apps/docs/docs/decisions/` and represent binding architectural decisions that must be followed.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- **Writing new code** - Ensure it follows established architectural patterns from ADRs
- **Reviewing pull requests** - Verify code compliance with documented standards
- **Refactoring existing code** - Align implementations with current ADRs
- **Adding dependencies** - Check against technology choices documented in ADRs
- **Making design decisions** - Verify alignment or identify need for new ADR
- **Implementing features** - Follow patterns from relevant domain/infrastructure ADRs

## CellixJS Architectural Decisions (ADRs)

All architectural decisions are documented in `apps/docs/docs/decisions/`. The following ADRs define 
standards that **MUST** be enforced in code:

### Architecture & Design Patterns

#### ADR-0003: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Standards to Enforce:**

1. **Bounded Contexts** - Code must be organized by bounded context
   - Location: `packages/ocom/domain/contexts/{context-name}/`
   - Each context has its own ubiquitous language
   
2. **Entity Structure** - Entities must follow DDD patterns
   - File: `{entity}.ts`
   - Must have unique identity (ID)
   - Contains business logic methods
   - Props interface defines state
   
3. **Value Objects** - Immutable objects defined by their values
   - File: `{entity}.value-objects.ts`
   - Must be immutable
   - Use `@lucaspaganini/value-objects` framework
   
4. **Aggregate Roots** - Entry points for entity clusters
   - File: `{entity}.ts` (aggregate root entities)
   - Enforces business rules for the aggregate
   - Guards integrity of related entities
   
5. **Unit of Work Pattern** - Atomic operations on domain models
   - File: `{entity}.uow.ts`
   - Transaction boundary for persistence
   - One per aggregate root

6. **Layer Separation**
   - **Domain Layer**: Business logic only, no infrastructure
   - **Application Service Layer**: Orchestration, coordinates use cases
   - **Infrastructure Service Layer**: External systems, third-party APIs

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Is code organized by bounded context?
- [ ] Do entities have unique identifiers?
- [ ] Are value objects immutable?
- [ ] Are aggregate boundaries respected?
- [ ] Is domain logic separate from infrastructure?
- [ ] Are Unit of Work patterns used for persistence?

#### ADR-0019: MonoRepo and Turborepo

**Standards to Enforce:**

1. **Package Organization**
   - Workspace structure defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
   - Package naming: `@ocom/*` or `@cellix/*`
   
2. **Build System**
   - Use Turborepo for builds: `pnpm run build`
   - Respect package dependencies
   - Use affected builds: `pnpm run build:affected`
   
3. **Testing**
   - Package-level tests in each workspace
   - Use `pnpm run test:affected`
   - Coverage reports per package

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Is new code in the correct workspace package?
- [ ] Are package dependencies declared in package.json?
- [ ] Do build scripts use Turborepo commands?
- [ ] Are tests co-located with the code they test?

### Code Quality & Standards

#### ADR-0012: Biome for Linting

#### ADR-0013: Test Suite Architecture

**Standards to Enforce:**

1. **Test Framework**
   - Use Vitest for unit tests
   - Test coverage via `pnpm run test:coverage`
   
2. **Test Organization**
   - Unit tests: Co-located with source files
   - Integration tests: Separate directory
   - E2E tests: SerenityJS (ADR-0007)
   
3. **Coverage Requirements**

#### ADR-0022: Snyk Security Integration

**Standards to Enforce:**

1. **Security Scanning**
   - Run Snyk before commits: `pnpm run snyk`
   - Includes SAST (code), SCA (dependencies), IaC (Bicep)
   
2. **Vulnerability Management**
   - Fix critical/high vulnerabilities immediately
   - Document exceptions in `.snyk` file
   - Get CODEOWNERS approval for ignores
   
3. **Workflow**
   - Scan during development with `snyk_code_scan` MCP tool
   - Verify fixes with re-scan
   - Pass Snyk gate before commit

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Does code pass Snyk security scans?
- [ ] Are vulnerabilities addressed or documented?

## Code Enforcement Workflow

### When Writing New Code

1. **Identify Relevant ADRs**
   - Search `apps/docs/docs/decisions/` for applicable standards
   - Read ADRs related to your domain, technology, or pattern
   
2. **Apply ADR Standards**
   - Follow file naming conventions
   - Use documented patterns
   - Respect layer boundaries
   
3. **Verify Compliance**
   - Run linting: `pnpm run lint`
   - Run tests: `pnpm run test`
   - Run security scan: `pnpm run snyk`
   - Full verification: `pnpm run verify`

### When Reviewing Code

1. **Check ADR Alignment**
   - Identify which ADRs apply to the changes
   - Verify code follows documented patterns
   
2. **Common Violations**
   - Domain logic in infrastructure layer (violates ADR-0003)
   - Using ESLint instead of Biome (violates ADR-0012)
   - Missing tests (violates ADR-0013)
   - Unscanned dependencies (violates ADR-0022)
   - Not using Bicep for infrastructure (violates ADR-0011)
   
3. **Request Changes**
   - Reference specific ADR in review comments
   - Explain which standard is violated
   - Suggest corrective action

### When Making Architectural Decisions

1. **Check Existing ADRs**
   - Search for related decisions
   - Verify no conflicts with current ADRs
   
2. **Determine if New ADR Needed**
   - New framework/library adoption → Requires ADR
   - New architectural pattern → Requires ADR
   - Infrastructure changes → Requires ADR
   - Refactoring without architectural impact → No ADR needed
   
3. **Create ADR if Required**
   - Follow process in ADR-0001
   - Use templates in `apps/docs/docs/decisions/`
   - Get approval from deciders before implementing

## Common Code Patterns by ADR

### DDD Pattern (ADR-0003)

**Correct Implementation:**
```typescript
// packages/ocom/domain/contexts/user/user.ts
export interface UserProps {
  readonly id: UserId;
  readonly email: Email;
  readonly profile: UserProfile;
}

export class User implements AggregateRoot<UserProps> {
  constructor(private props: UserProps) {}
  
  get id(): UserId { return this.props.id; }
  
  updateEmail(newEmail: Email): void {
    // Domain logic here
    this.props = { ...this.props, email: newEmail };
  }
  
  // No database or infrastructure code here!
}
```

**Incorrect Implementation (violates ADR-0003):**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: Domain entity with database code
export class User {
  async save(): Promise<void> {
    await mongoose.model('User').save(this); // Infrastructure in domain!
  }
}
```

### Service Registration (ADR-0014)

**Correct Implementation:**
```typescript
// Proper dependency injection
Cellix.initializeServices<ApiContextSpec>((serviceRegistry) => {
  serviceRegistry.registerService(new ServiceMongoose(...));
  serviceRegistry.registerService(new ServiceOtel(...));
})
.setContext((serviceRegistry) => ({ 
  domainDataSource: contextBuilder(serviceRegistry.getService(ServiceMongoose)),
  telemetry: serviceRegistry.getService(ServiceOtel)
}));
```

### Turborepo Usage (ADR-0019)

**Correct Commands:**
```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm run build

# Build only affected packages
pnpm run build:affected

# Test with turbo caching
pnpm run test
```

**Incorrect:**
```bash
# ❌ WRONG: Building individual packages directly
cd packages/ocom/domain && npm run build
```

## Enforcement During Code Generation
