# Linear Task Planner

Plan iOS implementation from Linear tasks with repeatable data collection and a consistent Markdown plan output.

## Quick start

1) Capture Linear context and save it for reuse.
2) Load the Linear API token from a local env file.
3) Run the skill with the issue key.
4) Fetch the issue data needed for planning.
5) Write a Markdown plan using the template.

Example invocation:

```
$linear-task-planner SKI-1
```

In this mode, use the API token flow by default and map the issue key to `--identifier`.
`--identifier` expects the Linear key format `TEAM-123` and is resolved via the team key + issue number filter.

## Capture and persist Linear context

Collect these once per workspace/board and save them for future use:

- Workspace slug or name
- Team key and/or team id
- Project id (if the board maps to a project)
- Board URL
- Default env file path
- Auth mode (`token` or `mcp`)
- Auth scheme (`raw` for personal API key or `bearer` for OAuth)
- MCP server name (if using MCP)

Save to a local config file (repo root): `.linear-task-planner.json`.
Add it to `.gitignore` to avoid committing workspace details.

Use the helper script to initialize or update it:

```bash
python3 skills/linear-task-planner/scripts/linear_fetch.py init \
  --workspace "your-workspace" \
  --team-key "ENG" \
  --team-id "team-id" \
  --project-id "project-id" \
  --board-url "https://linear.app/your-workspace/team/ENG" \
  --env ".env.local" \
  --auth-mode token \
  --auth-scheme raw
```

When starting a plan, ask the developer which auth mode they prefer:

- **API token** (default): use the script and `LINEAR_API_TOKEN` from the env file.
- **MCP**: if they already have a local MCP server for Linear, prefer it and store `authMode=mcp` + `mcpServer`.

If `authMode=mcp`, do not use `linear_fetch.py`. Instead, call the MCP server for Linear and request the same fields as the GraphQL queries in `references/issue.graphql`, `references/project.graphql`, and `references/team.graphql`.

## Load the API token

Expect `LINEAR_API_TOKEN` in a local env file (e.g., `.env.local`, `.env`).
Use `.env.local.example` as a template.

- Keep the token out of git.
- Use `--env` on commands when the env file is not `.env.local` or `.env`.
- You can pass `--env` before or after the subcommand.

## Fetch task data

Use the helper script to pull issue or project data into JSON.

Issue data (include comments and attachments):

```bash
python3 skills/linear-task-planner/scripts/linear_fetch.py issue \
  --identifier "ENG-123" \
  --env .env.local \
  --details \
  --out plans/ENG-123.json
```

If you are using OAuth tokens, set the auth scheme:

```bash
python3 skills/linear-task-planner/scripts/linear_fetch.py issue \
  --identifier "ENG-123" \
  --details \
  --auth-scheme bearer \
  --out plans/ENG-123.json
```

Project data (list issues, then pick the target issue):

```bash
python3 skills/linear-task-planner/scripts/linear_fetch.py project \
  --id "project-id" \
  --first 50 \
  --out plans/project.json
```

Team data (board view / backlog):

```bash
python3 skills/linear-task-planner/scripts/linear_fetch.py team \
  --id "team-id" \
  --first 50 \
  --out plans/team.json
```

If a query fails due to schema changes, use the custom query path and adjust fields via the GraphQL explorer:

```bash
python3 skills/linear-task-planner/scripts/linear_fetch.py custom \
  --query skills/linear-task-planner/references/issue.graphql \
  --variables '{"issueId": "..."}'
```

## Build the Markdown plan

Use the template in `references/plan-template.md`. Populate it with:

- Title, description, and acceptance criteria
- Attachments and design links (Figma, FigJam, Zeplin, etc.)
- Recent comments for updated scope or constraints
- Dependencies, risks, and open questions
- Implementation steps and testing notes
- Best-practice checks from the SwiftUI and concurrency skills

Save the plan in `plans/{issue-identifier}.md` (create `plans/` if missing).

## Required data checklist

Always attempt to collect these fields before planning:

- Issue title, description, and URL
- Labels, priority, state, due date
- Assignee and team/project context
- Attachments (screenshots, files) and design links
- Recent comments (scope changes, edge cases, UX details)

## Apply best-practice skills while planning

When you write the plan, explicitly map decisions to the existing skills:

- `swiftui-guidelines` for state management, async patterns, and view organization
- `swift-concurrency-expert` for actor isolation, Sendable, and data-race safety
- `swiftui-performance-audit` for avoiding heavy work in `body` and identity stability
- `swiftui-ui-patterns` for NavigationStack, lists/grids, sheets, and app wiring
- `swiftui-view-refactor` for consistent view structure and MV-first patterns
- `swiftui-liquid-glass` if iOS 26+ glass UI is in scope (include fallbacks)

If any of these introduce constraints or tradeoffs, capture them in the plan under “Risks & Dependencies” or “Open Questions.”

Read the source skills as needed for detailed guidance:

- `skills/swift-concurrency-expert/SKILL.md`
- `skills/swiftui-guidelines/SKILL.md`
- `skills/swiftui-liquid-glass/SKILL.md`
- `skills/swiftui-performance-audit/SKILL.md`
- `skills/swiftui-ui-patterns/SKILL.md`
- `skills/swiftui-view-refactor/SKILL.md`
