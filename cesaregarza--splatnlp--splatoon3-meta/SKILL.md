# Splatoon 3 Meta Knowledge Expert

Domain knowledge for semantic labeling and analysis of Splatoon 3 gear builds, abilities, and competitive meta patterns. Designed for SAE feature labeling and build pattern classification.

## Quick Reference: Core Frameworks

### The AP System
- **Main slot**: 10 AP (also written as 1.0 in Japanese notation)
- **Sub slot**: 3 AP (also written as 0.1)
- **Max per build**: 57 AP (3 gear pieces × 19 AP)
- **Diminishing returns**: First sub = ~10% max effect (HIGHEST efficiency), First main = ~30%

### Japanese Meta Terminology
| Term | Meaning | Implication |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **お守り (Omamori)** | "Charm gear" | Small investments (0.1-0.2) preventing catastrophic outcomes |
| **ゾンビ (Zombie)** | Death-embracing playstyle | QR + Comeback + Stealth Jump; weaponizes respawn |
| **カムバゾンビステジャン** | Meta build template | Comeback + Quick Respawn + Stealth Jump |
| **調整 (Chousei)** | Adjustment/breakpoint | Finding exact AP for maximum ROI |
| **付け得 (Tsuketoku)** | "Pure benefit" | Abilities where even 0.1 is always worth it |

### The Four Omamori (Universal 0.1 Investments)
Always valuable at single-sub investment:
1. **Quick Super Jump** — Escape vector, gauge preservation
2. **Sub Resistance Up** — Combo breaking (30→28.4 dmg)
3. **Ink Resistance Up** — Mobility floor, DoT buffer
4. **Special Saver** — 50%→41% gauge loss on death

## Labeling Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Build Archetype
Determine primary playstyle from ability composition:

| Archetype | Key Indicators | Death Philosophy |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Zombie Slayer** | QR ≥1.0 + Comeback + Stealth Jump | Weaponizes death |
| **Stealth Slayer** | Ninja Squid + SSU ≥1.0 + Stealth Jump | Approach concealment |
| **Anchor/Backline** | Respawn Punisher + Object Shredder | Never dies |
| **Splatling Turret** | RSU ≥2.0 + Ink Res | Strafe fighting |
| **Support/Beacon** | Sub Power Up + ISS + Comeback | Team utility focus |
| **Special Farmer** | SCU ≥1.0 + Special Saver + Tenacity | Special as win condition |

### Step 2: Classify Ability Relationships
For each ability in the build, identify its functional role:

**Primary Categories**:
- `omamori` — Safety/insurance investment (typically 0.1-0.2)
- `zombie` — Death mitigation / aggression enabler
- `mobility` — Movement and positioning
- `efficiency` — Ink/special resource management
- `information` — Vision control (stealth or tracking)
- `punishment` — Making kills hurt more
- `team-utility` — Benefits teammates

**Secondary Tags**:
- `breakpoint-dependent` — Value hinges on specific AP threshold
- `weapon-specific` — Only valuable on certain weapon classes
- `mode-dependent` — Value changes by game mode
- `slot-exclusive` — Competes with other main-only abilities

### Step 3: Identify Synergies/Conflicts
Check for known relationships:

**Critical Synergies**:
- Ninja Squid → REQUIRES SSU ≥1.0 (offset 10% penalty)
- Comeback + QR + Stealth Jump → Complete Zombie package
- Respawn Punisher + Object Shredder → Anchor control package

**Critical Conflicts**:
- Respawn Punisher + Quick Respawn → RP reduces QR by 85%
- Respawn Punisher + frontline weapon → Self-penalty exceeds benefit
- Stealth Jump + Drop Roller → Same slot exclusion

  - Japanese terminology and shorthand
  - Standard AP adjustments and breakpoints
  - Weapon-specific context
  - Synergies and anti-synergies
  - Semantic tags for labeling

  - Playstyle associations
  - Template builds

- **[`references/synergies.md`](references/synergies.md)** — Relationship matrices:

  - Role (lane/job) and death tolerance
  - Quick lookup tables by trait

## Death-Related Ability Nuances

Critical distinction for labeling death-mitigation features:

| Ability | Mechanism | Incentivizes Death? |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Quick Respawn** | Faster respawn on no-kill deaths | **YES** — activates only on consecutive deaths without kills |
| **Comeback** | 20s stat boost post-respawn | **NO** — rewards capitalizing on window, not dying |
| **Special Saver** | Reduce gauge loss | **NO** — passive insurance |
| **Stealth Jump** | Safe aggressive jumps | **INDIRECT** — enables riskier positioning |
| **Respawn Punisher** | Punish opponent deaths | **NO** — punishes YOUR deaths harder |
| **Haunt** | Track your killer | **INDIRECT** — provides value from being killed |

## Feature Label Examples

When labeling SAE features, use patterns like:

```
Feature: High QR + Comeback + Stealth Jump activation
Label: zombie_slayer_package, death_mitigation_hard, aggressive_reentry

Feature: Ninja Squid without SSU compensation
Label: incomplete_build, missing_synergy, suboptimal_mobility

Feature: Respawn Punisher + QR co-occurrence
Label: critical_conflict, anti_synergy, build_error

Feature: Exactly 0.1 of QSJ + SubRes + InkRes + SpecialSaver
Label: omamori_package, optimal_utility, japanese_meta_standard

Feature: RSU ≥2.0 without Splatling weapon
Label: potential_mismatch, weapon_context_required, investigate
```

## AP Threshold Flags

Flag these specific investment levels:

| Ability | Threshold | Significance |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| SSU with Ninja Squid | ≥1.0 (10 AP) | Mandatory offset |
| Quick Respawn | ≥1.2 (12 AP) | Minimum effective Zombie |
| Intensify Action (Shooters) | 0.2 (6 AP) | "Golden ratio" for jump accuracy |
| Intensify Action (Blasters) | ≥1.0 (10 AP) | Ground accuracy while jumping |
| Run Speed Up (Splatlings) | ≥2.0 (20 AP) | Minimum for strafe viability |
| Special Saver | 0.1 (3 AP) | Highest efficiency single investment |

## MechInterp Integration

Use this skill when mechinterp analysis shows weapon-specific patterns.

### After weapon_sweep Analysis

If `weapon_sweep` shows a specific weapon dominates activation:

1. **Look up the weapon's kit** in `references/weapons.md`:
   - Find the weapon by name or ID
   - Note its sub weapon and special weapon

2. **Check if other high-activation weapons share kit components**:
   - Same sub weapon → Feature may encode sub weapon playstyle
   - Same special weapon → Feature may encode special farming/spam builds

3. **Cross-reference with weapon characteristics**:
   - Is this a "special-dependent" weapon? (See `references/weapons.md` special list)
   - What archetype does this weapon belong to? (See `references/archetypes.md`)

### Kit-Linked Feature Detection

When multiple weapons share a sub or special but feature activates for all of them:

| Pattern | Likely Interpretation |
|---------|----------------------|
| All high weapons have Squid Beakon | Beacon-focused playstyle feature |
| All high weapons have Ink Storm | Zoning/area denial special spam |
| All high weapons have Trizooka | Kill-focused special builds |
| All high weapons have Wave Breaker | Pressure special stacking |
| All high weapons have Crab Tank | Heavy special farming builds |

### Example: Feature 18712 Kit Analysis

```
weapon_sweep findings:
- Octobrush Nouveau: +0.22 delta (DOMINANT)
- Range Blaster: +0.09 delta
- Rapid Blaster: +0.08 delta

Kit lookup from weapons.md:
- Octobrush Nouveau: Squid Beakon + Ink Storm
- Range Blaster: Suction Bomb + Wave Breaker
- Rapid Blaster: Torpedo + Triple Inkstrike

Pattern check:
- No shared sub weapon
- But ALL are "special-dependent" weapons per meta

Conclusion: Feature encodes "Special Charge Up on special-dependent weapons"
           not just "Octobrush Nouveau builds"
```

### Quick Kit Lookup

For common weapon IDs in mechinterp output, see `references/weapons.md`.

Example high-frequency weapon IDs:
| ID | Weapon | Sub | Special |
|----|--------|-----|---------|
| 1111 | Octobrush Nouveau | Squid Beakon | Ink Storm |
| 220 | Range Blaster | Suction Bomb | Wave Breaker |
| 240 | Rapid Blaster | Torpedo | Triple Inkstrike |
| 2021 | Big Swig Roller | Splash Wall | Ink Vac |
| 2050 | Custom E-liter 4K | Squid Beakon | Kraken Royale |
