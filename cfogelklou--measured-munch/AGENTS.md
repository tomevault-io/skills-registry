# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Measured Munch** is a client-side Progressive Web App (PWA) for tracking intermittent fasting. It has no backend—all data persists in the browser's LocalStorage. The app deploys to a subdirectory path (`/measuredmunch/`) on applicaudia.se.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server (runs on localhost with Vite)
bun run dev

# Run tests (Vitest with jsdom environment)
bun run test

# Lint code
bun run lint

# Format code with Prettier
bun run format

# Check code formatting (without modifying)
bun run format:check

# Build for production (TypeScript compilation + Vite build)
bun run build

# Preview production build locally
bun run preview

# Generate self-signed SSL cert for local HTTPS testing
bun run genkeys

# Serve production build with HTTPS (requires cert from genkeys)
bun run serve
```

## Architecture

### State Management Pattern

The app uses a **React Context + LocalStorage** pattern for all state:

- **`context.tsx`**: `LSProvider` wraps the app and provides centralized state management
  - Handles cross-tab synchronization via `storage` events
  - Manages initial sync from localStorage on app load
  - Prevents duplicate history records when syncing

- **`hooks.ts`**: Custom hooks that bridge React state with localStorage
  - `useLocalStorage<T>()`: Generic hook for any localStorage key
  - `useLSFastingHours()`: User's fasting duration setting
  - `useLSCurrentFastingState()`: Active fast state (startTime, isActive)
  - `useLSHistory()`: Fasting records with stats tracking
  - `useLSClearAll()`: Wipes all app data

- **`types.ts`**: Core TypeScript interfaces
  - `FastState`: `{ isActive: boolean, startTime: number | null }`
  - `FastSettings`: `{ fastingHours: number }`
  - `FastingRecord`: `{ startTime, endTime, durationMs, targetMs }`
  - `TimeRemaining`: Countdown timer state

### Key Data Flows

**Starting a fast:**
1. User clicks "Start Fast" → `setFastingState({ isActive: true, startTime: Date.now() })`
2. `useCountdown` hook begins 1-second interval updates
3. Timer calculates remaining time based on `startTime + fastingHours`

**Stopping a fast (early):**
1. User clicks "I'm Hungry" → creates `FastingRecord` with current elapsed time
2. `addHistoryRecord()` saves to localStorage (checks for duplicates first)
3. Fast state cleared

**Fast completion:**
1. `useCountdown` detects `isComplete`
2. `App.tsx` useEffect calls `stopFast()` automatically
3. Record added to history as "successful" if `durationMs >= targetMs`

### Cross-Tab Synchronization

The `LSProvider` listens for browser `storage` events to keep state in sync across multiple tabs:

- Storage events only fire in other tabs (not the originating tab)
- History syncing requires special handling: records must be re-added individually to recalculate stats correctly
- Initial sync runs on mount to populate context from localStorage

### Vite Configuration

- **Base path**: `/measuredmunch/` — required for subdirectory deployment
- **PWA**: `vite-plugin-pwa` with auto-update service worker
- **Manifest**: Defines icons, display mode (standalone), and theme color
- **Testing**: Vitest with jsdom, globals enabled, setup file at `src/setupTests.ts`

### Deployment

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`)
  - Triggers: push to `main` or `devel`, all PRs
  - Runs: lint → type check → format check → tests → build → SFTP upload
  - Only deploys on push to `main`/`devel` (not PRs)
- **SFTP**: `scripts/batchfile_sftp.txt` uploads `dist/*` to `measuredmunch/` directory
- **Server**: Apache at applicaudia.se, no special routing needed (PWA handles its own routes)

## Important Constants

From `hooks.ts`:
- `DEFAULT_FASTING_HOURS = 16`
- `MIN_FASTING_MS = 5000` — minimum duration to count as a valid fast (prevents accidental clicks)
- LocalStorage keys: `measuredMunch:settings`, `measuredMunch:state`, `measuredMunch:history`

## AI Instructions Sync

**IMPORTANT**: `CLAUDE.md` is the **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** for AI agent instructions. Any changes to `CLAUDE.md` should be followed by running the copy script to propagate changes to other AI tools.

The `scripts/copy-ai-instructions.sh` script keeps AI assistant instructions in sync:
- Source: `CLAUDE.md` (SSOT)
- Copies to: `GEMINI.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Run this after updating CLAUDE.md** to propagate changes to other AI tools

```bash
./scripts/copy-ai-instructions.sh
```

## Design System

The comprehensive design system is documented in `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`. This guide covers:
- **Color Palette**: Electric Blue accent with Zinc/Slate dark theme
- **Typography System**: Inter font family with weight scale
- **Spacing Scale**: 4px base unit system
- **Component Patterns**: Bento grid variants, buttons, progress bars
- **Animation Guidelines**: Duration and easing functions
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG AA compliance, focus states, reduced motion
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile, tablet, desktop layouts

When making UI changes, reference the style guide to maintain consistency.

## Testing

- Framework: Vitest
- Environment: jsdom (simulates browser DOM)
- Test utilities: `@testing-library/react`
- Globals enabled (describe, it, expect available without imports)
- Setup file: `src/setupTests.ts` (for `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers)

### TDD Bug-Fixing Workflow

When fixing bugs, follow the **Red-Green-Refactor** TDD cycle:

1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests that reproduce the bug
   - Create a test file matching the source file (e.g., `useCountdown.test.ts`)
   - Write tests that will FAIL with the current buggy code
   - Verify tests fail before making changes

2. **Green Phase**: Implement the minimal fix
   - Make the smallest change that makes tests pass
   - Follow "innocent until proven guilty" for default state values
   - Run `bun run test --run` to verify all tests pass

3. **Refactor Phase**: Clean up and verify
   - Ensure no unnecessary changes were made
   - Run full test suite to catch regressions

**Example**: The "Fasting Complete" bug was fixed by:
- Writing tests that checked `isComplete: false` for inactive fasts
- Changing default state from `isComplete: true` to `isComplete: false`
- Fixing the `useEffect` logic that also set `isComplete: true` incorrectly

**Key Principle**: Default state values should be semantically neutral. For boolean states like "complete", default to `false` unless there's evidence of completion.

## Code Quality Tools

### ESLint

- Uses `typescript-eslint` for modern TypeScript linting
- React-specific rules via `eslint-plugin-react`
- Configured via `eslint.config.js` (flat config format)
- Key rule overrides:
  - `react/react-in-jsx-scope`: off (not needed in React 17+)
  - `react/prop-types`: off (using TypeScript instead)

### Prettier

- Configured in `.prettierrc.json` (JSON format for compatibility)
- Formatting rules:
  - Single quotes for JS/JSX
  - Trailing commas: all
  - Print width: 100 characters
  - 2-space indentation

### Sanity Checks Script

The `scripts/sanity_checks.sh` script runs all validation steps before deployment:
1. Calls `bun run lint` (ESLint)
2. Calls `tsc --noEmit` (TypeScript compilation check)
3. Calls `bun run format:check` (Prettier)
4. Calls `bun run test` (Vitest)
5. Calls `bun run build` (Production build)

This script is called directly by CI (not through package.json) and orchestrates the individual package.json scripts.
