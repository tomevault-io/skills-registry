# Project Conventions

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how it should handle global conventions.

## When to use this skill:

- Organizing file structure in src/ or server/ directories
- Managing environment variables and configuration
- Creating feature branches and commit messages
- Adding or updating npm dependencies
- Setting up Docker configuration or secrets
- Documenting setup instructions in README

## Instructions

- **Consistent Project Structure**: Organize files and directories in a predictable, logical structure that team members can navigate easily
- **Clear Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date README files with setup instructions, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines
- **Version Control Best Practices**: Use clear commit messages, feature branches, and meaningful pull/merge requests with descriptions
- **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables for configuration; never commit secrets or API keys to version control
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up-to-date and minimal; document why major dependencies are used
- **Code Review Process**: Establish a consistent code review process with clear expectations for reviewers and authors
- **Testing Requirements**: Define what level of testing is required before merging (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for incomplete features rather than long-lived feature branches
- **Changelog Maintenance**: Keep a changelog or release notes to track significant changes and improvements
