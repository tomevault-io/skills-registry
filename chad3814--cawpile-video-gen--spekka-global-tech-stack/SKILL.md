# Global Tech Stack

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how it should handle global tech stack.

## When to use this skill:

- Adding new npm dependencies or updating package.json
- Configuring TypeScript compiler options in tsconfig.json
- Working with Docker configuration or deployment setup
- Setting up AWS S3 integration or credential management
- Choosing libraries or frameworks for new features
- Making architectural decisions about service design

## Instructions

Define your technical stack below. This serves as a reference for all team members and helps maintain consistency across the project.

### Framework & Runtime
- **Application Framework:** Express 4.21
- **Language/Runtime:** TypeScript 5.6 on Node.js
- **Package Manager:** npm

### Video Generation
- **Video Engine:** Remotion 4.0
- **Component Framework:** React 18.3 (for Remotion compositions)
- **Video Format:** H.264 codec, 1080x1920 @ 30fps (9:16 TikTok format)
- **Animation System:** Frame-based timing (30fps)

### Storage & Infrastructure
- **Object Storage:** AWS S3 (rendered video storage)
- **Containerization:** Docker with Noto Color Emoji font
- **Credential Management:** Docker Secrets

### Testing & Quality
- **Test Framework:** Vitest (unit and integration tests)
- **Linting:** ESLint with TypeScript rules
- **Path Aliases:** `@/*` maps to `src/*`

### Architecture Patterns
- **Service Model:** Microservice (server-to-server backend for Cawpile.org)
- **Progress Updates:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) for render progress
- **API Design:** RESTful endpoints with Express middleware
