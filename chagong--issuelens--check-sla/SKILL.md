# Check SLA Skill

Check SLA (Service Level Agreement) status for GitHub issues and generate a comprehensive status summary.

## Overview

This skill checks whether issues meet SLA requirements defined in the target repository's `.github/sla.md` file. If no SLA instructions are found, it uses the default SLA strategy. It generates a detailed SLA status summary for the checked issues.

## Workflow

1. **Input**: Receive issue URL or issue number with repository (owner/repo)
2. **Fetch SLA instructions**: Read `.github/sla.md` from the target repository
3. **Determine SLA criteria**: Use repository-specific rules or default strategy
4. **Fetch issue**: Get issue details (labels, parent links, status)
5. **Evaluate SLA**: Check if issue meets all SLA criteria
6. **Generate summary**: Produce a detailed SLA status report

## Required Input from User

1. **Issue**: Issue URL or issue number with repository (owner/repo)

## Reading SLA Instructions

Fetch `.github/sla.md` from the target repository using GitHub MCP tools.

If `.github/sla.md` exists, parse and apply its SLA criteria.

If `.github/sla.md` is not found, use the **Default SLA Strategy**.

## Default SLA Strategy

When no repository-specific SLA is defined, apply these criteria:

**An issue is SLA-compliant if ANY of these conditions are true:**
- Issue has "need more info" label
- Issue has "need log" label

**Otherwise, the issue MUST meet ALL of these conditions to be SLA-compliant:**
1. **Parent link exists**: Issue must have a parent issue linked (tracked-by or sub-issue relationship)
2. **No "need attention" label**: Issue must NOT have the "need attention" label

**Tolerance Period:**
- Issues have a **7-day grace period** from creation date before SLA violations are reported
- Issues open for ≤ 7 days that don't meet criteria are marked as **Warning** (not yet a violation)
- Issues open for > 7 days that don't meet criteria are marked as **Violation**

**SLA Status:**
- ✅ **Good**: Issue meets SLA criteria
- ⚠️ **Warning**: Issue does not meet SLA criteria but is within the 7-day tolerance period
- ❌ **Violation**: Issue does NOT meet SLA criteria and has exceeded the 7-day tolerance → Notify assignees

For detailed criteria documentation, see [references/default-sla.md](references/default-sla.md).

## Parent Link Detection

To check if an issue has a parent, use the GitHub sub-issues API or the reference script:

**API Endpoint:**
```
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}/parent
```

**Using the reference script:**
```bash
python .github/skills/check-sla/scripts/get_parent_issue.py <owner> <repo> <issue_number>
```

The script requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` environment variable. Exit codes:
- `0` — Parent found (JSON output on stdout)
- `2` — No parent issue found
- `1` — Error

**Fallback detection:** If the API returns 404 (no parent set via sub-issues), also check the issue body for links to the parent repository (e.g., `https://github.com/{owner}/{parent-repo}/issues/{number}`). If such a link exists, consider the issue as having a parent.

See [scripts/get_parent_issue.py](scripts/get_parent_issue.py) for implementation details.

## SLA Evaluation Logic

```
IF issue has label "need more info" OR "need log":
    SLA Status = GOOD (waiting on reporter)
ELSE:
    IF parent link exists AND "need attention" label NOT present:
        SLA Status = GOOD
    ELSE:
        days_open = (today - issue.created_at).days
        IF days_open <= tolerance_days (default 7):
            SLA Status = WARNING (within tolerance period)
        ELSE:
            SLA Status = VIOLATION
```

## Example Commands

- "Check SLA for issue #123 in microsoft/vscode"
- "Verify SLA status for https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/456"
- "Check if issue #789 meets SLA requirements"
- "Get SLA status report for issues #100, #101, #102 in owner/repo"

## Output

Generate a comprehensive SLA status summary:

**If SLA is Good:**
```
## ✅ SLA Status: Compliant

**Issue:** #123 - [Issue Title]
**Repository:** owner/repo
**Assignees:** @user1, @user2
**Status:** Compliant

### Evaluation Details
| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Parent Link | ✅ Linked to #456 |
| "need attention" Label | ✅ Not present |
| Waiting Labels | N/A |

### Summary
This issue meets all SLA requirements. A parent tracking issue is linked and no immediate attention is required.
```

**If SLA is Warning (within 7-day tolerance):**
```
## ⚠️ SLA Status: Warning

**Issue:** #123 - [Issue Title]
**Repository:** owner/repo
**Assignees:** @user1, @user2
**Status:** Warning (within 7-day tolerance)
**Days Open:** 3 days (4 days remaining)

### Evaluation Details
| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Parent Link | ❌ Missing |
| "need attention" Label | ✅ Not present |
| Waiting Labels | N/A |
| Tolerance Period | ⚠️ 3 of 7 days elapsed |

### Action Needed Before Deadline
- **Missing parent link**: Link this issue to a parent tracking issue within 4 days to avoid SLA violation
```

**If SLA is Violated (past 7-day tolerance):**
```
## ❌ SLA Status: Violation

**Issue:** #123 - [Issue Title]
**Repository:** owner/repo
**Assignees:** @user1, @user2
**Status:** Violation
**Days Open:** 10 days (exceeded 7-day tolerance by 3 days)

### Evaluation Details
| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Parent Link | ❌ Missing |
| "need attention" Label | ❌ Present |
| Waiting Labels | N/A |
| Tolerance Period | ❌ Exceeded (10 days) |

### Failed Criteria
- **Missing parent link**: Issue is not linked to a parent tracking issue
- **Has "need attention" label**: Issue requires immediate attention

### Recommended Actions
1. Link this issue to a parent tracking issue
2. Address the "need attention" concerns and remove the label when resolved
```

**If Waiting on Reporter:**
```
## ⏸️ SLA Status: Waiting

**Issue:** #123 - [Issue Title]
**Repository:** owner/repo
**Assignees:** @user1, @user2
**Status:** Waiting on Reporter

### Evaluation Details
| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Parent Link | ⏸️ Not evaluated |
| "need attention" Label | ⏸️ Not evaluated |
| Waiting Labels | ✅ "need more info" present |

### Summary
This issue is waiting for additional information from the reporter. SLA evaluation is paused until the reporter responds.
