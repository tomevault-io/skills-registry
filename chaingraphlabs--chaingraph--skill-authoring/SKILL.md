# ChainGraph Skill Authoring Guide

This skill provides guidelines for creating and maintaining Claude Code skills for the ChainGraph monorepo.

## Skill Tree Philosophy

Skills in ChainGraph form a **composition graph**, not a hierarchy. Multiple skills trigger simultaneously based on task context. Design skills to compose well together.

```
FOUNDATION          PACKAGE CONTEXT       TECHNOLOGY         FEATURES
     │                    │                   │                  │
     ▼                    ▼                   ▼                  ▼
chaingraph-concepts → frontend-architecture → effector-patterns → port-system
                   → executor-architecture → dbos-patterns     → subscription-sync
                   → types-architecture    → xyflow-patterns   → optimistic-updates
```

## Naming Conventions

### DO
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `effector-patterns`, `port-system`
- Use clear, self-explanatory names
- Group by conceptual area, not package prefix

### DON'T
- No prefixes like `pkg-`, `lib-`, `feat-` (clutters the list)
- No abbreviations that aren't universally known
- No version numbers in names

### Naming Categories

| Category | Pattern | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Foundation | `{concept}` | `chaingraph-concepts` |
| Package | `{package}-architecture` | `frontend-architecture`, `executor-architecture` |
| Technology | `{tech}-patterns` | `effector-patterns`, `dbos-patterns` |
| Feature | `{feature}` or `{feature}-{aspect}` | `port-system`, `subscription-sync` |
| Meta | `skill-{purpose}` | `skill-authoring`, `skill-maintenance` |

## Directory Structure

```
.claude/skills/
├── {skill-name}/
│   ├── SKILL.md           # Required: Main skill content
│   ├── reference.md       # Optional: Detailed reference (if SKILL.md > 400 lines)
│   └── examples.md        # Optional: Code examples
```

Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Use supporting files for deep dives.

## Description Writing (CRITICAL)

The `description` field determines when Claude triggers the skill. Write it strategically:

### Structure
```yaml
description: |
  {What this skill covers} - {key concepts}.
  Use when {trigger conditions}.
  {Additional context}.
  Triggers: {comma-separated keywords}
```

### Example
```yaml
description: |
  Effector state management patterns and CRITICAL anti-patterns.
  Use when writing Effector stores, events, effects, samples, or
  any reactive state code. Contains anti-patterns to avoid.
  Triggers: effector, store, createStore, createEvent, createEffect,
  sample, combine, domain, useUnit, $store
```

### Description Best Practices

1. **Include trigger keywords** - Words users naturally say
2. **Mention file paths** - `apps/chaingraph-frontend`, `packages/chaingraph-executor`
3. **Flag CRITICAL content** - Use caps for must-know information
4. **List related concepts** - Helps semantic matching
5. **Keep under 1024 chars** - Claude Code limit

## Skill Content Structure

### Required Sections

```markdown
# {Skill Title}

Brief overview (2-3 sentences).

## Key Concepts
Core concepts the agent must understand.

## Patterns
Code patterns to follow with examples.

## Anti-Patterns (if applicable)
What to AVOID with examples of wrong vs right.

## Key Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `path/to/file` | What it does |

## Quick Reference
Concise lookup table or checklist.
```

### Optional Sections

- `## Examples` - Detailed code examples
- `## Common Tasks` - Step-by-step for frequent operations
- `## Troubleshooting` - Common issues and solutions
- `## Related Skills` - Links to related skills

## Skill Composition Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each skill covers ONE coherent knowledge domain. Don't mix unrelated concepts.

### 2. Composable Knowledge
Skills should work together. A frontend port bug might trigger:
- `chaingraph-concepts` (what ports ARE)
- `frontend-architecture` (where the code IS)
- `effector-patterns` (HOW stores work)
- `port-system` (port-SPECIFIC knowledge)

### 3. Layered Depth
- **Foundation skills**: Brief, always relevant
- **Package skills**: Architecture overview
- **Technology skills**: Deep patterns, anti-patterns
- **Feature skills**: Specific subsystem knowledge

### 4. No Duplication
Don't repeat information across skills. Reference other skills instead:
```markdown
For Effector patterns, see the `effector-patterns` skill.
```

## When to Create a New Skill

Create a new skill when:
- A knowledge domain is large enough (>100 lines of guidance)
- Agents frequently need this knowledge for specific tasks
- The knowledge is reusable across multiple task types
- Existing skills don't cover this area well

DON'T create a skill for:
- One-off information (put in CLAUDE.md instead)
- Package-specific details that fit in existing package skill
- Information that changes frequently (becomes stale)

## Skill Tree Organization

### Current Categories

| Category | Purpose | Current Skills |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Foundation | Universal ChainGraph knowledge | `chaingraph-concepts` |
| Package | Package-specific architecture | `frontend-architecture`, `executor-architecture`, `types-architecture` |
| Technology | Library/framework patterns | `effector-patterns`, `dbos-patterns`, `xyflow-patterns` |
| Feature | Cross-cutting subsystems | `port-system`, `subscription-sync`, `optimistic-updates` |
| Meta | Skill governance | `skill-authoring`, `skill-maintenance` |

### Adding New Categories

Only add a category if:
- 3+ skills would belong to it
- It represents a distinct knowledge domain
- Existing categories don't fit

## Quality Checklist

Before committing a new skill:

- [ ] Name follows conventions (lowercase, hyphens, no prefixes)
- [ ] Description under 1024 chars with trigger keywords
- [ ] SKILL.md under 500 lines
- [ ] Has Key Concepts section
- [ ] Has Patterns section with code examples
- [ ] Anti-patterns documented if applicable
- [ ] Key Files table included
- [ ] No duplication with existing skills
- [ ] Tested: would this trigger for the intended tasks?

## Maintaining Consistency

### When Updating Skills
- Keep the same structure
- Update examples to match current codebase
- Add new patterns discovered during development
- Remove deprecated patterns

### Version Tracking
Skills don't have versions. Keep them evergreen by:
- Updating when architecture changes
- Removing obsolete information
- Adding new patterns as they emerge

## Example: Creating a New Skill

Task: Create skill for "node-creation" (creating new ChainGraph nodes)

1. **Check if needed**: Is this knowledge large enough? Yes, 100+ lines.
2. **Choose name**: `node-creation` (clear, follows pattern)
3. **Write description**:
   ```yaml
   description: |
     Creating new ChainGraph nodes with decorators. Use when
     implementing new node types in packages/chaingraph-nodes.
     Covers @Node, @Input, @Output, port decorators, execute().
     Triggers: create node, new node, @Node, BaseNode, execute
   ```
4. **Structure content**: Key Concepts → Patterns → Anti-Patterns → Key Files
5. **Review checklist**: All items checked
6. **Test mentally**: "Create an AI node" - would this trigger? Yes.
