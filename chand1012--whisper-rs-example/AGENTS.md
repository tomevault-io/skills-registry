# Rust Best Practices

## Crates and Modules
- Use meaningful crate names that reflect their purpose (e.g., `auth`, `config`).
- Organize code into modules using the `mod` keyword and separate files.
- Use `pub` to expose items to other modules or crates when necessary.
- Manage dependencies with Cargo, specifying versions in `Cargo.toml` (e.g., `serde = "1.0"`).

## Type System
- Use `struct` for product types to group related data (e.g., `struct User { id: u32 }`).
- Use `enum` for sum types to represent variants (e.g., `enum Status { Active, Inactive }`).
- Define `trait` to specify behavior and enable polymorphism (e.g., `trait Display`).
- Use type aliases for clarity with complex types (e.g., `type Id = u32`).
- Leverage Rust’s ownership and borrowing system for memory safety (e.g., `&str` vs `String`).
- Use smart pointers like `Box`, `Rc`, or `Arc` for heap allocation and shared ownership.
- Avoid unnecessary `unsafe` code; isolate it when required.

## Naming Conventions
- Use `snake_case` for variables and functions (e.g., `get_user`).
- Use `PascalCase` for types and traits (e.g., `UserService`).
- Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`).
- Be descriptive yet concise in naming (e.g., `user_count` over `cnt`).

## Code Organization
- Follow the standard Rust project layout: `src/` for source, `tests/` for integration tests, `examples/` for examples.
- Include modules with `mod` in `lib.rs` or `main.rs` (e.g., `mod utils;`).
- Use workspaces for multi-crate projects via `Cargo.toml` (e.g., `[workspace]`).

## Functions and Methods
- Keep functions short and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use early returns with `Result` or `Option` for error handling (e.g., `if let Some(x) = opt { return x; }`).
- Avoid side effects to improve predictability and testability.

## Best Practices
- Prefer immutable bindings (`let`) over mutable ones (`let mut`) unless mutation is required.
- Use pattern matching for concise, expressive code (e.g., `match option { Some(v) => v, None => 0 }`).
- Leverage the type system to catch errors at compile time (e.g., via traits and generics).
- Use generics for type-safe, reusable code (e.g., `fn process<T: Display>(item: T)`).
- Utilize iterators and closures for functional programming (e.g., `vec.iter().map(|x| x * 2)`).
- Use macros to reduce boilerplate (e.g., `macro_rules! log`).
- Embrace memory safety features like ownership to prevent bugs.
- Run `rustfmt` for consistent formatting and `clippy` for linting (e.g., `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`).
- Avoid global variables; use `lazy_static` or `once_cell` if needed for thread-safe initialization.
- Optimize allocations in performance-critical code with tools like `perf` or `heaptrack`.
- Use `const fn` for compile-time evaluation (e.g., `const fn max(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32`).
- Check dependencies for vulnerabilities with `cargo audit`.

## Error Handling
- Use `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and `Option<T>` for optional values.
- Propagate errors with the `?` operator (e.g., `let data = read_file()?;
- Handle errors with `match` for explicit control (e.g., `match result { Ok(v) => v, Err(e) => ... }`).
- Avoid panics in library code; reserve them for unrecoverable errors in applications (e.g., `panic!("crash")`).

## Concurrency
- Use `std::thread` for concurrent tasks (e.g., `thread::spawn(|| { ... })`).
- Use channels for safe communication between threads (e.g., `let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel()`).
- Use `async/await` for I/O-bound concurrency (e.g., `async fn fetch_data()`).
- Leverage libraries like `Rayon` for data parallelism (e.g., `par_iter()`).
- Ensure thread safety with Rust’s ownership model (e.g., `Arc<Mutex<T>>`).

## Testing
- Write unit tests with the `#[test]` attribute (e.g., `#[test] fn test_add() { assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4); }`).
- Place integration tests in the `tests/` directory.
- Run tests with `cargo test` and aim for high coverage (e.g., `cargo test -- --nocapture`).

## Documentation
- Write doc comments for public items with `///` (e.g., `/// Adds two numbers`).
- Include examples in doc comments (e.g., `/// # Examples\n/// assert_eq!(add(2, 3), 5);`).
- Generate documentation with `cargo doc` (e.g., `cargo doc --open`).

## Patterns
- Use traits for dependency injection and mocking (e.g., `trait Logger` for testing).
- Implement the builder pattern for complex structs (e.g., `UserBuilder::new().name("Alice").build()`).
- Use the visitor pattern with enums for extensible behavior (e.g., `enum Event { Click, KeyPress }`).
