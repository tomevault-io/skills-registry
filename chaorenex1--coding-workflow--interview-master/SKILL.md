   - Role-specific deep dives
4. Include follow-up questions and evaluation criteria
5. Provide answer guidelines for interviewers

Typical output includes 10-15 questions with difficulty ratings, estimated time, and evaluation rubrics.

### 2. Resume Optimization

Analyze and improve resume content for technical roles with actionable feedback.

**Process:**
1. Review resume structure, formatting, and content
2. Reference `references/resume-best-practices.md` for industry standards
3. Evaluate:
   - Technical skills presentation
   - Project descriptions and impact metrics
   - Achievement quantification
   - ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility
   - Keyword optimization for target roles
4. Provide specific improvement suggestions with before/after examples
5. Check for common mistakes (typos, inconsistent formatting, vague descriptions)

Consult `examples/good-resume-examples.md` for reference patterns.

### 3. Mock Interview Simulation

Conduct realistic mock interviews with real-time feedback and performance evaluation.

**Process:**
1. Establish interview context (role, company type, interview stage)

### 4. Git-Based Resume Generation (Signature Feature)

Analyze git commit history to automatically generate resume content highlighting technical contributions and project impact.

**Workflow:**

**Step 1: Collect Repository Information**
- Identify target repository path
- Determine author name/email to analyze
- Specify time range (optional, default: all history)

**Step 2: Execute Analysis Scripts**

Use the following scripts in sequence:

1. **`scripts/analyze-commits.sh`** - Extract commit history
   ```bash
   ./scripts/analyze-commits.sh <author> <repo-path> [start-date] [end-date]
   ```
   Output: Commit count, frequency, file change patterns

2. **`scripts/extract-tech-stack.sh`** - Identify technologies
   ```bash
   ./scripts/extract-tech-stack.sh <repo-path> <author>
   ```
   Output: Programming languages, frameworks, tools detected from code changes
   Reference: `references/tech-stack-keywords.md` for keyword matching

3. **`scripts/calculate-impact.py`** - Quantify contributions
   ```bash
   python scripts/calculate-impact.py <repo-path> <author>
   ```
   Output: Lines added/removed, files modified, feature-critical commits
   Reference: `references/project-impact-metrics.md` for impact calculation

4. **`scripts/generate-resume-data.sh`** - Aggregate results
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-resume-data.sh <author> <repo-path>
   ```
   Output: Structured JSON with resume-ready content

**Step 3: Generate Resume Content**

Transform analysis into professional resume sections:

1. **Technical Skills Section**
   - Group technologies by category (languages, frameworks, tools, databases)
   - Prioritize by usage frequency and recency

2. **Project Experience Section**
   - Identify major features/modules from commit messages
   - Quantify impact (e.g., "Developed authentication system handling 10K+ daily users")
   - Highlight technical challenges solved
   - Use action verbs: "Architected", "Implemented", "Optimized", "Refactored"

3. **Key Achievements**
   - Extract notable contributions (large refactors, performance improvements, critical bug fixes)
   - Convert git data to business impact when possible
   - Include metrics from `references/project-impact-metrics.md`

**Step 4: Format and Review**

- Apply `assets/resume-template.md` structure
- Ensure ATS compatibility (plain text format, standard section headings)
- Cross-reference with `examples/good-resume-examples.md` for quality standards
- Validate technical terminology accuracy

**Example Usage:**
```
User: "Analyze my commits in this repository and generate resume content"
Assistant:
1. Runs analyze-commits.sh to get 247 commits over 18 months
2. Extracts tech stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker
3. Calculates impact: 15K lines added, 12 major features
4. Generates resume section:
   "Software Engineer | E-commerce Platform (Jan 2023 - Present)
   - Architected and implemented user authentication system using JWT and OAuth 2.0, serving 50K+ daily active users
   - Developed RESTful API with Node.js and Express, improving response time by 40% through query optimization
   - Built responsive admin dashboard with React and TypeScript, reducing content management time by 60%
   - Containerized application with Docker, enabling consistent deployment across 3 environments"
```
