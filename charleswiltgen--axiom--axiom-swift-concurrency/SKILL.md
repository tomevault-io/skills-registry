# Swift 6 Concurrency Guide

**Purpose**: Progressive journey from single-threaded to concurrent Swift code
**Swift Version**: Swift 6.3 (strict concurrency by default). `@concurrent` requires Swift 6.2+.
**iOS Version**: iOS 17+ (iOS 26+ for `@concurrent`)
**Xcode**: Xcode 16+ (Xcode 26+ for `@concurrent`)

## When to Use This Skill

✅ **Use this skill when**:
- Starting a new project and deciding concurrency strategy
- Debugging Swift 6 concurrency errors (actor isolation, data races, Sendable warnings)
- Deciding when to introduce async/await vs concurrency
- Implementing `@MainActor` classes or async functions
- Converting delegate callbacks to async-safe patterns
- Deciding between `@MainActor`, `nonisolated`, `@concurrent`, or actor isolation
- Resolving "Sending 'self' risks causing data races" errors
- Making types conform to `Sendable`
- Offloading CPU-intensive work to background threads
- UI feels unresponsive and profiling shows main thread bottleneck

❌ **Do NOT use this skill for**:
- General Swift syntax (use Swift documentation)
- SwiftUI-specific patterns (use `axiom-swiftui-debugging` or `axiom-swiftui-performance`)
- API-specific patterns (use API documentation)

## Core Philosophy: Think in Isolation Domains, Not Threads

> "Your apps should start by running all of their code on the main thread, and you can get really far with single-threaded code." — Apple

**Stop asking**: "What thread should this run on?"
**Start asking**: "What isolation domain should own this work?"

- `@MainActor` → UI state ownership
- Custom `actor` → shared mutable state ownership
- `nonisolated` → no ownership, caller decides
- `@concurrent` → force background execution

**Async does not mean background.** An `async` function suspends without blocking, but resumes on the *same actor* it was called from. A `@MainActor` async function runs entirely on the main actor — `await` just yields control, it does not switch threads. Use `@concurrent` (Swift 6.2+) when you need to force work off the calling actor.

**Prefer structured concurrency.** Use `async let` and `TaskGroup` for parallel work — they propagate cancellation and errors automatically through the task tree. Unstructured `Task {}` is for bridging sync→async boundaries (event handlers, SwiftUI `.task`). `Task.detached` is a last resort.

**GCD is a bridge pattern, not a default.** In new code, do not use `DispatchQueue`, `DispatchGroup`, `DispatchSemaphore`, or completion handlers as primary architecture. Use them only to bridge legacy APIs that don't have async alternatives yet. Isolate bridge code and keep the rest of the codebase idiomatic Swift 6.

### The Progressive Journey

```
Single-Threaded → Asynchronous → Concurrent → Actors
     ↓                ↓             ↓           ↓
   Start here    Hide latency   Background   Move data
                 (network)      CPU work     off main
```

**When to advance**:
1. **Stay single-threaded** if UI is responsive and operations are fast
2. **Add async/await** when high-latency operations (network, file I/O) block UI
3. **Add concurrency** when CPU-intensive work (image processing, parsing) freezes UI
4. **Add actors** when too much main actor code causes contention

**Key insight**: Concurrent code is more complex. Only introduce concurrency when profiling shows it's needed.

---

## Step 1: Single-Threaded Code (Start Here)

With Main Actor Mode enabled (the default for new projects in Xcode 26+), all code runs on the **main thread** unless explicitly marked otherwise.

```swift
// ✅ Simple, single-threaded
class ImageModel {
    var imageCache: [URL: Image] = [:]

    func fetchAndDisplayImage(url: URL) throws {
        let data = try Data(contentsOf: url)  // Reads local file
        let image = decodeImage(data)
        view.displayImage(image)
    }

    func decodeImage(_ data: Data) -> Image {
        // Decode image data
        return Image()
    }
}
```

#### Main Actor Mode (Xcode 26+)

- Enabled by default for new projects
- All code protected by `@MainActor` unless explicitly marked otherwise
- Access shared state safely without worrying about concurrent access

#### Build Setting (Xcode 26+)

```
Build Settings → Swift Compiler — Language
→ "Default Actor Isolation" = Main Actor

Build Settings → Swift Compiler — Upcoming Features
→ "Approachable Concurrency" = Yes
```

**When this is enough**: If all operations are fast (<16ms for 60fps), stay single-threaded!

---

## Step 2: Asynchronous Tasks (Hide Latency)

Add async/await when **waiting on data** (network, file I/O) would freeze UI.

### Problem: Network Access Blocks UI

```swift
// ❌ Blocks main thread until network completes
func fetchAndDisplayImage(url: URL) throws {
    let data = try Data(contentsOf: url)  // ❌ Synchronous network fetch, freezes UI!
    let image = decodeImage(data)
    view.displayImage(image)
}
```

### Solution: Async/Await

```swift
// ✅ Suspends without blocking main thread
func fetchAndDisplayImage(url: URL) async throws {
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)  // ✅ Suspends here
    let image = decodeImage(data)  // ✅ Resumes here when data arrives
    view.displayImage(image)
}
```

**What happens**:
1. Function starts on main thread
2. `await` suspends function without blocking main thread
3. URLSession fetches data on background thread (library handles this)
4. Function resumes on main thread when data arrives
5. UI stays responsive the entire time

### Task Creation

Create tasks in response to user events:

```swift
class ImageModel {
    var url: URL = URL(string: "https://swift.org")!

    func onTapEvent() {
        Task {  // ✅ Create task for user action
            do {
                try await fetchAndDisplayImage(url: url)
            } catch {
                displayError(error)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Task Interleaving (Important Concept)

Multiple async tasks can run on the **same thread** by taking turns:

```
Task 1: [Fetch Image] → (suspend) → [Decode] → [Display]
Task 2: [Fetch News]  → (suspend) → [Display News]

Main Thread Timeline:
[Fetch Image] → [Fetch News] → [Decode Image] → [Display Image] → [Display News]
```

**Benefits**:
- Main thread never sits idle
- Tasks make progress as soon as possible
- No concurrency yet—still single-threaded!

**Critical**: Both tasks above run on the main actor. The `await` keyword suspends the task and frees the thread, but when the task resumes, it returns to the *same isolation domain* (main actor). No background thread is involved unless the awaited API (like URLSession) handles that internally.

**When to use tasks**:
- High-latency operations (network, file I/O)
- Library APIs handle background work for you (URLSession, FileManager)
- Your own code stays on main thread

---

## Step 3: Concurrent Code (Background Threads)

Add concurrency when **CPU-intensive work** blocks UI.

### Problem: Decoding Blocks UI

Profiling shows `decodeImage()` takes 200ms, causing UI glitches:

```swift
func fetchAndDisplayImage(url: URL) async throws {
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    let image = decodeImage(data)  // ❌ 200ms on main thread!
    view.displayImage(image)
}
```

### Solution 1: `@concurrent` Attribute (Swift 6.2+)

Forces function to **always run on background thread**:

```swift
func fetchAndDisplayImage(url: URL) async throws {
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    let image = await decodeImage(data)  // ✅ Runs on background thread
    view.displayImage(image)
}

@concurrent
func decodeImage(_ data: Data) async -> Image {
    // ✅ Always runs on background thread pool
    // Good for: image processing, file I/O, parsing
    return Image()
}
```

**What `@concurrent` does**:
- Function always switches to background thread pool
- Compiler highlights main actor data access (shows what you need to fix)
- Cannot access `@MainActor` properties without `await`

**Requirements**: Swift 6.2+, Xcode 26+, iOS 26+

### Solution 2: `nonisolated` (Library APIs)

If providing a general-purpose API, use `nonisolated` instead:

```swift
// ✅ Stays on caller's actor
nonisolated
func decodeImage(_ data: Data) -> Image {
    // Runs on whatever actor called it
    // Main actor → stays on main actor
    // Background → stays on background
    return Image()
}
```

**When to use `nonisolated`**:
- Library APIs where **caller decides** where work happens
- Small operations that might be OK on main thread
- General-purpose code used in many contexts

**When to use `@concurrent`**:
- Operations that **should always** run on background (image processing, parsing)
- Performance-critical work that shouldn't block UI

### Breaking Ties to Main Actor

When you mark a function `@concurrent`, compiler shows main actor access:

```swift
@MainActor
class ImageModel {
    var cachedImage: [URL: Image] = [:]  // Main actor data

    @concurrent
    func decodeImage(_ data: Data, at url: URL) async -> Image {
        if let image = cachedImage[url] {  // ❌ Error: main actor access!
            return image
        }
        // decode...
    }
}
```

#### Strategy 1: Move to caller

```swift
func fetchAndDisplayImage(url: URL) async throws {
    // ✅ Check cache on main actor BEFORE async work
    if let image = cachedImage[url] {
        view.displayImage(image)
        return
    }

    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    let image = await decodeImage(data)  // No URL needed now
    view.displayImage(image)
}

@concurrent
func decodeImage(_ data: Data) async -> Image {
    // ✅ No main actor access needed
    return Image()
}
```

#### Strategy 2: Access via @MainActor helper

```swift
@MainActor
func getCachedImage(for url: URL) -> Image? {
    cachedImage[url]
}

@concurrent
func decodeImage(_ data: Data, at url: URL) async -> Image {
    // ✅ Call @MainActor function to access isolated state
    if let image = await getCachedImage(for: url) {
        return image
    }
    // decode...
}
```

#### Strategy 3: Make nonisolated

```swift
nonisolated
func decodeImage(_ data: Data) -> Image {
    // ✅ No actor isolation, can call from anywhere
    return Image()
}
```

### Concurrent Thread Pool

When work runs on background:

```
Main Thread:    [UI] → (suspend) → [UI Update]
                         ↓
Background Pool: [Task A] → [Task B] → [Task A resumes]
                 Thread 1    Thread 2    Thread 3
```

**Key points**:
- System manages thread pool size (1-2 threads on Watch, many on Mac)
- Task can resume on different thread than it started
- You never specify which thread—system optimizes automatically

---

## Step 4: Actors (Move Data Off Main Thread)

Add actors when **too much code runs on main actor** causing contention.

### Problem: Main Actor Contention

```swift
@MainActor
class ImageModel {
    var cachedImage: [URL: Image] = [:]
    let networkManager: NetworkManager = NetworkManager()  // ❌ Also @MainActor

    func fetchAndDisplayImage(url: URL) async throws {
        // ✅ Background work...
        let connection = await networkManager.openConnection(for: url)  // ❌ Hops to main!
        let data = try await connection.data(from: url)
        await networkManager.closeConnection(connection, for: url)  // ❌ Hops to main!

        let image = await decodeImage(data)
        view.displayImage(image)
    }
}
```

**Issue**: Background task keeps hopping to main actor for network manager access.

### Solution: Network Manager Actor

```swift
// ✅ Move network state off main actor
actor NetworkManager {
    var openConnections: [URL: Connection] = [:]

    func openConnection(for url: URL) -> Connection {
        if let connection = openConnections[url] {
            return connection
        }
        let connection = Connection()
        openConnections[url] = connection
        return connection
    }

    func closeConnection(_ connection: Connection, for url: URL) {
        openConnections.removeValue(forKey: url)
    }
}

@MainActor
class ImageModel {
    let networkManager: NetworkManager = NetworkManager()

    func fetchAndDisplayImage(url: URL) async throws {
        // ✅ Now runs mostly on background
        let connection = await networkManager.openConnection(for: url)
        let data = try await connection.data(from: url)
        await networkManager.closeConnection(connection, for: url)

        let image = await decodeImage(data)
        view.displayImage(image)
    }
}
```

**What changed**:
- `NetworkManager` is now an `actor` instead of `@MainActor class`
- Network state isolated in its own actor
- Background code can access network manager without hopping to main actor
- Main thread freed up for UI work

### When to Use Actors

✅ **Use actors for**:
- Non-UI subsystems with independent state (network manager, cache, database)
- Data that's causing main actor contention
- Separating concerns from UI code

❌ **Do NOT use actors for**:
- UI-facing classes (ViewModels, View Controllers) → Use `@MainActor`
- Model classes used by UI → Keep `@MainActor` or non-Sendable
- Every class in your app (actors add complexity)

**Guideline**: Profile first. If main actor has too much state causing bottlenecks, extract one subsystem at a time into actors.

---

## Sendable Types (Data Crossing Actor Boundaries)

When data passes between actors or tasks, Swift checks it's **Sendable** (safe to share).

### Value Types Are Sendable

```swift
// ✅ Value types copy when passed
let url = URL(string: "https://swift.org")!

Task {
    // ✅ This is a COPY of url, not the original
    // URLSession.shared.data runs on background automatically
    let data = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
}

// ✅ Original url unchanged by background task
```

**Why safe**: Each actor gets its own independent copy. Changes don't affect other copies.

### What's Sendable?

```swift
// ✅ Basic types
extension URL: Sendable {}
extension String: Sendable {}
extension Int: Sendable {}
extension Date: Sendable {}

// ✅ Collections of Sendable elements
extension Array: Sendable where Element: Sendable {}
extension Dictionary: Sendable where Key: Sendable, Value: Sendable {}

// ✅ Structs/enums with Sendable storage
struct Track: Sendable {
    let id: String
    let title: String
    let duration: TimeInterval
}

enum PlaybackState: Sendable {
    case stopped
    case playing
    case paused
}

// ✅ Main actor types
@MainActor class ImageModel {}  // Implicitly Sendable (actor protects state)

// ✅ Actor types
actor NetworkManager {}  // Implicitly Sendable (actor protects state)
```

### Reference Types (Classes) and Sendable

```swift
// ❌ Classes are NOT Sendable by default
class MyImage {
    var width: Int
    var height: Int
    var pixels: [Color]

    func scale(by factor: Double) {
        // Mutates shared state
    }
}

let image = MyImage()
let otherImage = image  // ✅ Both reference SAME object

image.scale(by: 0.5)  // ✅ Changes visible through otherImage!
```

**Problem with concurrency**:

```swift
func scaleAndDisplay(imageName: String) {
    let image = loadImage(imageName)

    Task {
        image.scale(by: 0.5)  // Background task modifying
    }

    view.displayImage(image)  // Main thread reading
    // ❌ DATA RACE! Both threads could touch same object!
}
```

#### Solution 1: Finish modifications before sending

```swift
@concurrent
func scaleAndDisplay(imageName: String) async {
    let image = loadImage(imageName)
    image.scale(by: 0.5)  // ✅ All modifications on background
    image.applyAnotherEffect()  // ✅ Still on background

    await view.displayImage(image)  // ✅ Send to main actor AFTER modifications done
    // ✅ Main actor now owns image exclusively
}
```

#### Solution 2: Don't share classes concurrently

Keep model classes `@MainActor` or non-Sendable to prevent concurrent access.

### Sendable Checking

Happens automatically when:
- Passing data into/out of actors
- Passing data into/out of tasks
- Crossing actor boundaries with `await`

```swift
func fetchAndDisplayImage(url: URL) async throws {
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    //  ↑ Sendable    ↑ Sendable (crosses to background)

    let image = await decodeImage(data)
    //          ↑ data crosses to background (must be Sendable)
    //                            ↑ image returns to main (must be Sendable)
}
```

---

## Common Patterns (Copy-Paste Templates)

### Pattern 1: Sendable Enum/Struct

**When**: Type crosses actor boundaries

```swift
// ✅ Enum (no associated values)
private enum PlaybackState: Sendable {
    case stopped
    case playing
    case paused
}

// ✅ Struct (all properties Sendable)
struct Track: Sendable {
    let id: String
    let title: String
    let artist: String?
}

// ✅ Enum with Sendable associated values
enum FetchResult: Sendable {
    case success(data: Data)
    case failure(error: Error)  // Error is Sendable
}
```

---

### Pattern 2: Delegate Value Capture (CRITICAL)

**When**: `nonisolated` delegate method needs to update `@MainActor` state

```swift
nonisolated func delegate(_ param: SomeType) {
    // ✅ Step 1: Capture delegate parameter values BEFORE Task
    let value = param.value
    let status = param.status

    // ✅ Step 2: Task hop to MainActor
    Task { @MainActor in
        // ✅ Step 3: Safe to access self (we're on MainActor)
        self.property = value
        print("Status: \(status)")
    }
}
```

**Why**: Delegate methods are `nonisolated` (called from library's threads). Capture parameters before Task. Accessing `self` inside `Task { @MainActor in }` is safe.

---

### Pattern 3: Weak Self in Tasks

**When**: Task is stored as property OR runs for long time

```swift
class MusicPlayer {
    private var progressTask: Task<Void, Never>?

    func startMonitoring() {
        progressTask = Task { [weak self] in  // ✅ Weak capture
            guard let self = self else { return }

            while !Task.isCancelled {
                await self.updateProgress()
            }
        }
    }

    deinit {
        progressTask?.cancel()
    }
}
```

**Note**: Short-lived Tasks (not stored) can use strong captures.

---

### Pattern 4: Background Work with @concurrent

**When**: CPU-intensive work should always run on background (Swift 6.2+)

```swift
@concurrent
func decodeImage(_ data: Data) async -> Image {
    // ✅ Always runs on background thread pool
    // Good for: image processing, file I/O, JSON parsing
    return Image()
}

// Usage
let image = await decodeImage(data)  // Automatically offloads
```

**Requirements**: Swift 6.2+, Xcode 26+, iOS 26+

---

### Pattern 5: Isolated Protocol Conformances (Swift 6.2+)

**When**: Type needs to conform to protocol with specific actor isolation

```swift
protocol Exportable {
    func export()
}

class PhotoProcessor {
    @MainActor
    func exportAsPNG() {
        // Export logic requiring UI access
    }
}

// ✅ Conform with explicit isolation
extension StickerModel: @MainActor Exportable {
    func export() {
        photoProcessor.exportAsPNG()  // ✅ Safe: both on MainActor
    }
}
```

**When to use**: Protocol methods need specific actor context (main actor for UI, background for processing)

---

### Pattern 6: #isolation Capture for Non-Sendable Types (SE-0420)

**When**: Task closure needs to work with non-Sendable delegates or objects

```swift
func process(
    delegate: NonSendableDelegate,
    isolation: isolated (any Actor)? = #isolation
) {
    Task {
        _ = isolation  // Forces capture — Task inherits caller's isolation
        delegate.doWork()  // ✅ Safe: running on caller's actor
    }
}
```

**Why `_ = isolation` is required**: Per SE-0420, Task closures only inherit isolation when a non-optional binding of an isolated parameter is captured by the closure. Without this line, the Task runs on the default executor and the non-Sendable capture is an error.

**When to use**: Spawning Tasks that work with non-Sendable delegate objects, fire-and-forget async work that needs access to caller's state, or bridging callback-based APIs to async streams.

---

### Pattern 7: Task Timeout

**When**: Async operation must complete within a deadline

```swift
func withTimeout<T: Sendable>(
    _ duration: Duration,
    operation: @Sendable @escaping () async throws -> T
) async throws -> T {
    try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: T.self) { group in
        group.addTask { try await operation() }
        group.addTask {
            try await Task.sleep(for: duration)
            throw TimeoutError()
        }
        guard let result = try await group.next() else {
            throw TimeoutError()
        }
        group.cancelAll()  // Cancel the loser (critical — without this it keeps running)
        return result
    }
}

// Usage
let data = try await withTimeout(.seconds(5)) {
    try await slowNetworkRequest()
}
```

---

### Pattern 8: MainActor for UI Code

**When**: Code touches UI

```swift
@MainActor
class PlayerViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentTrack: Track?
    @Published var isPlaying: Bool = false

    func play(_ track: Track) async {
        // Already on MainActor
        self.currentTrack = track
        self.isPlaying = true
    }
}
```

---

## Data Persistence Concurrency Patterns

### Pattern 9: Background SwiftData Access

```swift
actor DataFetcher {
    let modelContainer: ModelContainer

    func fetchAllTracks() async throws -> [Track] {
        let context = ModelContext(modelContainer)
        let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Track>(
            sortBy: [SortDescriptor(\.title)]
        )
        return try context.fetch(descriptor)
    }
}

@MainActor
class TrackViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var tracks: [Track] = []

    func loadTracks() async {
        let fetchedTracks = try await fetcher.fetchAllTracks()
        self.tracks = fetchedTracks  // Back on MainActor
    }
}
```

### Pattern 10: Core Data Thread-Safe Fetch

```swift
actor CoreDataFetcher {
    func fetchTracksID(genre: String) async throws -> [String] {
        let context = persistentContainer.newBackgroundContext()
        var trackIDs: [String] = []

        try await context.perform {
            let request = NSFetchRequest<CDTrack>(entityName: "Track")
            request.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "genre = %@", genre)
            let results = try context.fetch(request)
            trackIDs = results.map { $0.id }  // Extract IDs before leaving context
        }

        return trackIDs  // Lightweight, Sendable
    }
}
```

### Pattern 11: Batch Import with Progress

```swift
actor DataImporter {
    func importRecords(_ records: [RawRecord], onProgress: @Sendable @MainActor (Int, Int) -> Void) async throws {
        let chunkSize = 1000
        let context = ModelContext(modelContainer)

        for (index, chunk) in records.chunked(into: chunkSize).enumerated() {
            for record in chunk {
                context.insert(Track(from: record))
            }
            try context.save()

            let processed = (index + 1) * chunkSize
            await onProgress(min(processed, records.count), records.count)

            if Task.isCancelled { throw CancellationError() }
        }
    }
}
```

### Pattern 12: GRDB Background Execution

```swift
actor DatabaseQueryExecutor {
    let dbQueue: DatabaseQueue

    func fetchUserWithPosts(userId: String) async throws -> (user: User, posts: [Post]) {
        return try await dbQueue.read { db in
            let user = try User.filter(Column("id") == userId).fetchOne(db)!
            let posts = try Post
                .filter(Column("userId") == userId)
                .order(Column("createdAt").desc)
                .limit(100)
                .fetchAll(db)
            return (user, posts)
        }
    }
}
```

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Starting new feature?
└─ Is UI responsive with all operations on main thread?
   ├─ YES → Stay single-threaded (Step 1)

## Build Settings (Xcode 16+)

```
Build Settings → Swift Compiler — Language
→ "Default Actor Isolation" = Main Actor
→ "Approachable Concurrency" = Yes

Build Settings → Swift Compiler — Concurrency
→ "Strict Concurrency Checking" = Complete
```

**Swift Package Manager equivalent**:

```swift
.target(
    name: "MyTarget",
    swiftSettings: [
        .swiftLanguageMode(.v6),
        .defaultIsolation(MainActor.self)
    ]
)
```

**What this enables**:
- Main actor mode (all code @MainActor by default)
- Compile-time data race prevention
- Progressive concurrency adoption

---

## Anti-Patterns and Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why it's wrong | Do this instead |
|---|---|---|
| "I'll use `Task.detached` to make it background" | `Task.detached` loses actor context, priority, and task-local values. It's rarely what you want. | Use `@concurrent` (Swift 6.2+) for forced background. Use `Task {}` when you need actor inheritance. |
| "I'll add `@unchecked Sendable` to silence this" | You're hiding a data race from the compiler. It will crash in production. | Make the type genuinely Sendable (struct/enum), use an actor, or use `sending` parameter. |
| "I'll use `nonisolated(unsafe)` to fix this" | Zero runtime protection. The compiler stops checking — data races go undetected. | Use proper isolation (`@MainActor`, actor, Mutex). Reserve for global constants only. |
| "This async function runs on a background thread" | `async` suspends without blocking but resumes on the **same actor**. A `@MainActor` async function runs on the main thread. | Use `@concurrent` to force background. Don't assume async = background. |
| "I'll wrap this in `DispatchQueue.global().async`" | GCD queue-hopping inside structured concurrency breaks isolation guarantees and risks thread explosion. | Use `@concurrent` or extract to an actor. Keep GCD in bridge layers only. |
| "Every class needs to be an actor" | Actors add serialization overhead. UI code on a custom actor can't update views. | Use `@MainActor` for UI/ViewModel code. Actors are for non-UI shared mutable state only. |
| "I'll use `@preconcurrency` to ship faster" | You're assuming thread-safety the compiler can't verify. Crashes appear in production. | Migrate to proper concurrency. Use `@preconcurrency` only as a temporary bridge with a removal ticket. |
| "I need concurrency for this feature" | Concurrency adds complexity. Most app code runs fine single-threaded on MainActor. | Profile first. Only escalate when Instruments shows a bottleneck. |
| "Each Task maps to a thread" | Tasks share a cooperative thread pool. A task can resume on any thread after suspension. | Think in isolation domains, not threads. |
| "I'll spawn a Task for each piece of work" | Unstructured Tasks lose cancellation propagation and error handling. They're harder to reason about. | Use `async let` (fixed count) or `TaskGroup` (dynamic count) for related parallel work. Reserve `Task {}` for sync→async bridges. |

### ❌ Using Concurrency When Not Needed

```swift
// ❌ Premature optimization
@concurrent
func addNumbers(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) async -> Int {
    return a + b  // ❌ Trivial work, concurrency adds overhead
}

// ✅ Keep simple
func addNumbers(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
}
```

### ❌ Strong Self in Stored Tasks

```swift
// ❌ Memory leak — task retains self, self retains task
progressTask = Task {
    while true {
        await self.update()  // ❌ Strong capture in infinite loop
    }
}

// ✅ Weak capture breaks the cycle
progressTask = Task { [weak self] in
    while let self, !Task.isCancelled {
        await self.updateProgress()
    }
}
```

**Rule of thumb**: Strong self is fine in short-lived Tasks that complete quickly. Use `[weak self]` when the Task is stored as a property or runs indefinitely (loops, async sequences).

### ❌ Making Every Class an Actor

```swift
// ❌ Don't do this
actor MyViewModel: ObservableObject {  // ❌ UI code should be @MainActor!
    @Published var state: State  // ❌ Won't work correctly
}

// ✅ Do this
@MainActor
class MyViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var state: State
}
```

### ❌ Thread.current in Async Contexts

```swift
// ❌ Swift 6 language mode: compiler error
func checkThread() async {
    print(Thread.current)  // ERROR: unavailable from asynchronous contexts
}

// ✅ If you must inspect threads (debugging only)
extension Thread {
    static var currentThread: Thread { Thread.current }
}
print(Thread.currentThread)  // Works, but don't rely on thread identity
```

**Why**: Tasks move between threads at suspension points. Thread identity is meaningless in Swift Concurrency — reason about isolation domains instead.

## Code Review Checklist

### Before Adding Concurrency
- [ ] Profiled and confirmed UI unresponsiveness
- [ ] Identified specific slow operations (network, CPU, contention)
- [ ] Started with simplest solution (async → concurrent → actors)

### Async/Await
- [ ] Used for high-latency operations only
- [ ] Task creation in response to events
- [ ] Error handling with do-catch

### Background Work
- [ ] `@concurrent` for always-background work (Swift 6.2+)
- [ ] `nonisolated` for library APIs
- [ ] No blocking operations on main actor

### Sendable
- [ ] Value types for data crossing actors
- [ ] Classes stay @MainActor or non-Sendable
- [ ] No concurrent modification of shared classes

### Actors
- [ ] Only for non-UI subsystems
- [ ] UI code stays @MainActor
- [ ] Model classes stay @MainActor or non-Sendable

## Migration Habits

When migrating an existing codebase to strict concurrency:

1. **Iterate in small batches** — Fix one module or one diagnostic category at a time. Rebuild, test, commit. Don't batch.
2. **Design new types as Sendable from the start** — Retrofitting Sendable onto existing types cascades through the codebase.
3. **Set default isolation early** — For app modules, set `@MainActor` as the default isolation. This eliminates most false warnings.
4. **Avoid scope creep** — Concurrency migration PRs should contain only concurrency changes, not architecture refactors.
5. **Don't suppress warnings to ship faster** — `@unchecked Sendable`, `nonisolated(unsafe)`, and `@preconcurrency` are migration tools, not permanent solutions. Track each one with a removal ticket.
