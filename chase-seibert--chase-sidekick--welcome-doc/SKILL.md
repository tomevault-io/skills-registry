# Welcome Doc Skill

Create personalized employee onboarding documents in Confluence based on a template or example.

When invoked, use the Welcome Doc agent to handle the request: $ARGUMENTS

## Usage

```
/welcome-doc link1 link2 free text context
```

The agent will first try to figure out whatever it can by reading any provided links to templates and examples, then interactively prompt as needed for:
1. Template or example document (Confluence URL, Paper URL, or local file)
2. New employee details (name, role, team)
3. Team information and context
4. Direct reports (if applicable) and optional screenshot
5. Additional context (manager PTO, onboarding buddy, etc.)
