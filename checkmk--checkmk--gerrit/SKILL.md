# When asked to submit a Gerrit change:

```
curl -s --netrc "https://review.lan.tribe29.com/a/changes/125896/submit" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

This will submit the change and all its unmerged parents
(provided all the changes have the required approvals).

# When asked to improve a Gerrit change:

1. Fetch the current state from Gerrit

`gerrit-change-log HEAD`

2. In case a Verified -1 is reported, fetch the Jenkins job results using the jenkins skill
3. For each failed stage, fetch the details of the triggered stage job

# When asked for the list of open Gerrit changes

```
# List all your open changes
gerrit-change-log --list

# Find changes needing attention (negative score)
gerrit-change-log --list | grep ':-'
```

# To retrigger the change validation

You can retrigger the change validation without pushing the commit again.
If you are sure that the CV failed due to reasons outside of your change,
you may retrigger the CV by posting "start: test-gerrit" on the change.

# When asked to submit a commit chain

Do an rebase on top of the base branch. Select the first change and push it for
review. Wait for the CV job to finish. In case it fails, gather the state from
the jenkins job. Reproduce the issue locally, fix it, verify it locally, then
push for review again. Do this until the CV job finishes successfully. Then
follow the same procedure with the next change. Do this until all changes are
verified by the CV job.
At the end provide a list of changes and a summary of the necessary changes that
each commit needed.

# In case the command gerrit-change-log is missing

Ask the user to clone the zeug_cmk git repository and add it to their PATH.
