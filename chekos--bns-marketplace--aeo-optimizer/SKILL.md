# AEO Optimizer

Optimize tacosdedatos content to be cited by AI search engines.

**Context**: `/agents/shared/tacosdedatos-growth-playbook.md` has current traffic data (ChatGPT: 7 visits, Perplexity: 3 visits — early but growing).

## Key Insight

AI assistants cite content that:
1. **Answers questions directly** in the first 2-3 sentences
2. **Uses structured formats** (numbered lists, tables, clear headers)
3. **Is recent** (93% of Perplexity citations are 2024-2025)
4. **Has topical authority** (multiple related articles on the same subject)

## Quick Audit Checklist

For any piece of content, check:

```
□ First paragraph directly answers the main question
□ Has numbered lists or bullet points for key information
□ Uses H2/H3 headers as natural questions
□ Includes a clear definition early ("X is...")
□ Has specific numbers, steps, or examples
□ Updated within last 12 months
□ Part of a topic cluster (linked related content)
```

## AEO-Optimized Structure

```markdown
# [Question as H1]

[Direct 2-3 sentence answer with key facts]

## [Supporting question as H2]

[Numbered list or table with specifics]

## [Another angle as H2]

[More detail, examples, code]
```

## Platform Differences

See `references/platform-behaviors.md` for how each AI handles citations differently:
- **ChatGPT**: Prefers authoritative, comprehensive sources
- **Perplexity**: Cites inline, loves recent listicles
- **Google AI Overviews**: Pulls from top 10 organic results

## Spanish Content Opportunity

Most AI assistants lack quality Spanish sources for technical topics. Being the definitive Spanish resource on a topic significantly increases citation likelihood.

High-opportunity topics for tacosdedatos:
- AI tool tutorials in Spanish
- Python/pandas guides in Spanish
- Data visualization techniques in Spanish
