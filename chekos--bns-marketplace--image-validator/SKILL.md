# Image Validator

Quality gate for tacosdedatos illustrations.

**Reference**: `agents/shared/illustration-style-guide.md` for authoritative mode definitions and color palette.

---

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Identify the Mode

First, determine which of the 7 modes the image fits (or should fit):

| Mode | Key Identifiers |
|------|-----------------|
| **Abstract/Geometric** | Shapes, lines, no figures, technical feel |
| **Paper-Cut/Layered** | Overlapping silhouettes, depth layers |
| **Surrealist/Evocative** | Dreamlike, unexpected combinations, emotional |
| **Nature + Tech Fusion** | Plants + data cards, organic + digital |
| **Atmospheric/Cinematic** | Scene-based, moody lighting, environment |
| **Playful Cartoon** | Expressive characters, dynamic, icons |
| **Data Dashboard** | Charts, visualizations, laptop/screens |

**If no mode fits**: Flag as potentially off-brand.

### Step 2: Run the Checklist

Check each criterion:

#### Core Requirements

| Criterion | Check | Pass/Fail |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Mode fit** | Does it clearly fit one of the 7 modes? | |
| **Color palette** | Are colors from the tacosdedatos palette? | |
| **Texture** | Is there subtle grain/risograph texture? | |
| **No text** | Is there any embedded text, labels, or watermarks? | |
| **Metaphor clarity** | Is there a clear visual concept? | |
| **Negative space** | Is there generous breathing room? | |
| **Aspect ratio** | Is it landscape (~16:9 or 3:2)? | |

#### Color Validation

Check against palette:

| Color | Hex | Present? |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Negro Mezquite (bg) | `#121212` | |
| Teal Oscuro (bg) | `#1a2e35` | |
| Crema Nevada | `#F1FAEE` | |
| Rojo Fuego | `#E63946` | |
| Azul Niebla | `#A8DADC` | |
| Naranja Cempasúchil | `#F4A261` | |
| Verde Maguey | `#4E937A` | |

**Tolerance**: Colors don't need to be exact hex matches, but should be recognizably from the palette family. Flag if:
- Bright/saturated colors outside palette
- Pastel tones
- Neon colors
- Pure white backgrounds

#### Human Figure Check (if present)

| Style | Acceptable? |
|-------|-------------|
| Silhouette (solid, no features) | ✓ |
| Layered profile (overlapping heads) | ✓ |
| Flat character (simple shapes) | ✓ |
| Expressive cartoon (big eyes, gestures) | ✓ |
| Abstract avatar (icon-style) | ✓ |
| Atmospheric figure (stylized in scene) | ✓ |
| Photorealistic human | ✗ |
| Stock illustration style | ✗ |
| Generic corporate people | ✗ |

### Step 3: Score and Verdict

**Scoring**:
- Each core criterion: 1 point
- Total possible: 7 points

**Verdicts**:

| Score | Verdict | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 7/7 | **PASS** | Ready for publication |
| 5-6/7 | **PASS WITH NOTES** | Minor issues, acceptable |
| 3-4/7 | **NEEDS REVISION** | Regenerate with fixes |
| 0-2/7 | **FAIL** | Start over with different approach |

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Unwanted Text

**Detection**: Any letters, numbers, words, labels visible

**Fix**: Add to negative prompt:
```
Absolutely no text, no letters, no words, no writing, no labels, no numbers, no watermarks
```

### Issue: Wrong Colors

**Detection**: Colors outside palette (bright, pastel, neon)

**Fix**: Add explicit hex codes:
```
Colors MUST use only: #121212, #F1FAEE, #E63946, #A8DADC, #F4A261, #4E937A
```

### Issue: Too Cluttered

**Detection**: No clear focal point, busy composition

**Fix**: Simplify prompt:
```
Single focal element. Generous negative space. Minimal composition. Clean and simple.
```

### Issue: Missing Texture

**Detection**: Flat, plastic, or glossy appearance

**Fix**: Add texture cues:
```
Subtle risograph grain texture throughout. Matte finish. No glossy surfaces.
```

### Issue: Photorealistic Style

**Detection**: Looks like a photo or 3D render

**Fix**: Emphasize style:
```
Flat digital illustration. No photorealism. No 3D render. No realistic textures.
```

### Issue: Generic/Stock Style

**Detection**: Looks like corporate clip art or stock illustration

**Fix**: Be more specific about style:
```
In the style of modern editorial illustration. Sophisticated and unique. Not corporate clip art.
```

### Issue: Wrong Aspect Ratio

**Detection**: Square or portrait orientation

**Fix**: Specify in generation settings:
```
aspect_ratio="16:9" or aspect_ratio="3:2"
```
