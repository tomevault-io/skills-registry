# tacosdedatos Editor

This skill provides comprehensive editorial review capabilities for tacosdedatos content. It combines developmental editing (big-picture feedback) with voice authenticity review (ensuring the distinctive tacosdedatos voice).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for editorial review tasks:
- Reviewing draft submissions for publication readiness
- Providing developmental feedback on structure and flow
- Evaluating voice authenticity (does it sound like tacosdedatos?)
- Identifying content gaps and weak arguments
- Assessing engagement potential before publication
- Giving authors actionable feedback for revisions

**Not for**: Creating content (use tacosdedatos-writer) or final grammar polish (use copy-editor agent).

## The Editorial Review Process

### Step 1: First Read (No Notes)

Read the entire piece without marking anything. Get the gestalt:
- What's the core argument?
- How does it make you feel?
- Where did you lose interest?
- What stuck with you?

### Step 2: Developmental Review

Read `references/editorial-checklist.md` and evaluate:

**Structure Analysis**
1. Does the opening follow the 4-beat rhythm? (Spark → Stakes → Zoom → Thesis)
2. Is there a clear structure (Transformation Arc, Deep Dive, or Reflective)?
3. Does each section flow concrete → abstract?
4. Is the closing a reframe (not a recap)?

**Argument Strength**
1. Is the thesis clear and defensible?
2. Are claims supported with evidence (metrics, examples, experience)?
3. Are there logical gaps or unsupported leaps?
4. Does the piece earn its conclusions?

**Pacing & Flow**
1. Are there engagement dead zones? (Abstract philosophy without examples, lists without narrative)
2. Is there enough breathing room? (Visual breaks every 300-400 words)
3. Does the piece maintain momentum?
4. Is the length appropriate for the content type?

### Step 3: Voice Authenticity Review

Evaluate against the tacosdedatos voice fingerprint:

**Bilingual Balance**
- Spanish-first with English only for untranslatable tech terms?
- Code-switching feels natural, not forced?
- Technical jargon treated like casual conversation?

**Vulnerability + Expertise**
- Does the author share struggles before successes?
- Is there genuine vulnerability, not performative humility?
- Does confidence coexist with admitted uncertainty?

**Cultural Grounding**
- Are abstract concepts anchored with Mexican/Latino cultural references?
- Do metaphors feel authentic, not generic?
- Is the tone peer-to-peer ("tú" not "usted")?

**Anti-AI Markers**
- No generic phrases ("It's important to note", "In conclusion")?
- No empty antitheses ("No es X. Es Y" without real contrast)?
- Does it pass the coffee test? (Would you say this to a friend?)

### Step 4: Engagement Assessment

Check against engagement mechanics:

**Opening Power** (see `references/hook-formulas.md` for patterns)
- Does the first line use a proven hook formula? (Curiosity, Value-Forward, Story, Data/Surprise, Contrarian, Question)
- Does the hook create a curiosity gap?
- Are stakes established within 150 words?
- Would this hook work as a tweet or subject line?

**Reader Journey**
- Is there a transformation story (clear before/after)?
- Are there concrete metrics/achievements?
- Does personal vulnerability create connection?

**Shareability Factors**
- Is there a counterintuitive take?
- Is there a quotable metaphor?
- Is there a specific, actionable framework?

**Call to Action**
- Is there one clear CTA (not multiple competing ones)?
- Does it invite community participation?

## Feedback Delivery

Read `references/feedback-format.md` for structure. Always provide:

### 1. Overall Assessment (2-3 sentences)

The gestalt: What's working, what's the core issue, publication readiness.

```
## Overall Assessment

**Verdict**: [Ready / Needs Revision / Major Restructuring Required]

[2-3 sentence summary of strengths and primary concern]
```

### 2. Structural Feedback (If Needed)

Big-picture issues with structure, flow, or argument.

```
## Structural Feedback

**Issue**: [What's wrong]
**Impact**: [Why it matters]
**Suggestion**: [How to fix]
```

### 3. Voice Notes

Specific passages that don't sound like tacosdedatos.

```
## Voice Notes

**Passage**: "[Quote the problematic text]"
**Issue**: [Why it doesn't work - too formal, generic, missing grounding, etc.]
**Reframe**: [Suggestion or example of how to fix]
```

### 4. Highlight Reel

What's working well (important for author morale and learning).

```
## What's Working

- [Specific element that's strong]
- [Another strength]
- [Quote a particularly good passage]
```

### 5. Priority Actions

Top 3 things to fix, in order of importance.

```
## Priority Actions

1. [Most important fix]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
```

## Common Issues to Watch For

Read `references/common-issues.md` for detailed patterns. Quick reference:

### Voice Issues
- **AI-speak**: Generic phrases, empty conclusions, missing personality
- **False formality**: "Usted" tone, passive voice, corporate language
- **Missing grounding**: Abstract concepts without cultural anchors or concrete examples

### Structure Issues
- **Weak openings**: No spark, stakes buried, thesis unclear
- **Recap closings**: Summarizing instead of reframing
- **Dead zones**: Long stretches without examples, code, or personal connection

### Engagement Issues
- **No transformation**: Missing before/after or clear stakes
- **Generic advice**: Could appear in any tech blog
- **CTA overload**: Multiple competing calls to action

## Working with Authors

### Tone
- Be direct but constructive
- Lead with what's working
- Be specific, not vague ("This paragraph loses momentum" not "Needs work")
- Explain the "why" behind feedback

### Priorities
- Focus on big issues first (structure, argument, voice)
- Don't nitpick grammar if the structure needs work
- Maximum 3 priority actions per review

### Edge Cases

**When the piece is almost ready:**
Light touch. Note 1-2 small voice tweaks and send to copy-editor.

**When the piece needs major work:**
Focus on the ONE biggest structural issue. Don't overwhelm with everything wrong.

**When the voice is off throughout:**
Pick 2-3 representative passages to reframe. Don't rewrite the whole piece.

## Reference Files

All reference files are in `references/`:

- **`editorial-checklist.md`**: Complete checklist for developmental and voice review
- **`feedback-format.md`**: Templates for structuring editorial feedback
- **`common-issues.md`**: Detailed patterns of common problems and fixes
- **`hook-formulas.md`**: Proven hook patterns for evaluating and improving openings

Also reference the writer skill's materials in `../tacosdedatos-writer/references/`:
- `voice-analysis.md` - Voice rules and when to break them
- `structure-patterns.md` - The 3 main structures and formulas
- `writing-principles.md` - Core principles (Optimistic Realism, etc.)
- `engagement-mechanics.md` - Top engagement techniques and dead zones

## Quality Bar

A piece is ready for publication when:
- [ ] Structure is clear and appropriate for content type
- [ ] Opening establishes stakes within 150 words
- [ ] Voice sounds authentically like tacosdedatos
- [ ] No AI-speak or empty antitheses
- [ ] Every abstraction is grounded in concrete example
- [ ] Closing reframes rather than recaps
- [ ] There's a clear transformation story
- [ ] Single, clear CTA
- [ ] Passes the coffee test

## Important Notes

- **Review holistically first**: Read the whole piece before making notes
- **Voice over perfection**: Authentic voice matters more than polished prose
- **Be specific**: Quote passages, don't speak in generalities
- **Prioritize ruthlessly**: Authors can only fix so much at once
- **Stay in your lane**: Editing is not rewriting. Guide, don't take over.
