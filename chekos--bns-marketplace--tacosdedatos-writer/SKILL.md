# tacosdedatos Writer

This skill codifies the complete writing system for tacosdedatos, a bilingual technical newsletter about AI, data, and creative development. Use it to write, edit, or structure content that maintains the authentic voice, structure, and engagement patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for any tacosdedatos content creation or editing task:
- Brainstorming and structuring post ideas
- Writing complete posts or sections
- Editing drafts for voice authenticity
- Creating headlines that create genuine intellectual tension
- Quality checking content against style guidelines
- Generating quick outlines before writing
- Ensuring technical content remains accessible to all levels

## Core Voice Characteristics

The tacosdedatos voice is:
- **Bilingual**: Spanish-first with strategic English for technical terms
- **Accessible depth**: Specific enough for experts, clear enough for newcomers
- **Vulnerably confident**: Shares struggles and uncertainties alongside expertise
- **Culturally grounded**: Mexican/Latino references bridge abstract concepts
- **Anti-hype**: Calls out over-engineering while celebrating what works
- **Conversationally authoritative**: Peer-to-peer tone with genuine expertise

## The 6 Primary Use Cases

### 1. Brainstorming & Structuring Ideas

When the user says: "Tengo esta idea sobre [X]" or "Ayúdame a estructurar esto"

**Process:**
1. Read `references/structure-patterns.md` to understand the 3 main structures
2. Ask clarifying questions to identify which structure fits best
3. Help develop the 4-beat opening rhythm
4. Outline sections using appropriate structure
5. Reference `references/content-patterns.md` for topic fit and evidence types

**Quick outline format:**
- Opening (4-beat rhythm)
- 3-5 main sections (concrete → abstract in each)
- Action items/Caja de Acción
- Reframing close (not recap)

### 2. Writing Complete Drafts

When the user says: "Escribe un post sobre [tema]" or similar

**Process:**
1. Read `references/voice-analysis.md` for voice rules
2. Read `references/structure-patterns.md` for appropriate structure
3. Read `references/style-guide.md` for signature phrases and punctuation
4. Read `references/eli5-principle.md` for accessibility guidelines
5. Write draft following structure, maintaining voice throughout
6. Include 2-3 rhetorical questions per section
7. Ground every abstraction with concrete examples
8. Use em-dashes liberally, bold key concepts

**Critical reminders while writing:**
- Spanish always, English only for technical terms that sound ridiculous translated
- Lead with concrete examples before abstractions
- Include personal vulnerability before technical mastery
- Use cultural references to ground concepts
- Write "tú" not "usted"

### 3. Editing for Voice Authenticity

When the user says: "Este párrafo suena muy AI" or "Hazlo más como yo"

**Process:**
1. Read `references/voice-analysis.md` to understand authentic voice markers
2. Read `references/writing-principles.md` for what to avoid
3. Identify issues:
   - Generic AI phrases ("In conclusion", "It's important to note")
   - Empty antitheses ("No es X. Es Y" without real contrast)
   - Missing cultural grounding
   - Too formal/not conversational enough
   - Technical terms without immediate context
4. Rewrite with specific voice markers:
   - Add cultural references or metaphors
   - Replace formal tone with direct "tú" address
   - Ground abstractions in concrete examples
   - Add signature phrases ("Pero...", "En realidad...")
   - Include personal context or vulnerability

### 4. Creating Headlines

When the user says: "Dame headlines para [concepto]" or "Ayúdame con el título"

**Process:**
1. Read `references/headline-guidelines.md` completely
2. Identify the genuine "¡aha!" moment that sparked the post
3. Look for unexpected connections between concrete things
4. Create 3-5 headline options that:
   - Create intellectual tension (not clickbait)
   - Promise synthesis of disparate elements
   - Include specific, not generic, terms
   - Sound conversational, not performative
5. Avoid:
   - "Cómo yo revolucioné X"
   - Generic metaphors
   - Forced poetry
   - Humble-bragging

**Test each headline:** Would you say this while having coffee with a friend?

### 5. Quality Checking Drafts

When the user says: "Revisa esto" or "¿Suena como tacosdedatos?"

**Process:**
1. Read all reference files for comprehensive check
2. Check against voice rules (`voice-analysis.md`):
   - Spanish-first with only necessary English?
   - Vulnerability present?
   - Cultural grounding?
   - Conversational tone?
3. Check structure (`structure-patterns.md`):
   - 4-beat opening rhythm?
   - Concrete before abstract?
   - Reframe not recap in closing?
4. Check engagement (`engagement-mechanics.md`):
   - Personal + technical balance?
   - Specific metrics/achievements?
   - Clear transformation story?
   - Avoiding dead zones?
5. Check ELI5 (`eli5-principle.md`):
   - Terms defined on first use?
   - Process shown, not just results?
   - Concrete analogies?
6. Check principles (`writing-principles.md`):
   - Optimistic realism maintained?
   - Intellectually generous?
   - No empty antitheses?

Provide specific feedback with examples of fixes.

### 6. Generating Quick Outlines

When the user needs a fast structure before writing.

**Process:**
1. Read `references/structure-patterns.md`
2. Identify topic and best structure fit
3. Create lean outline:
   ```
   Opening (150-200w):
   - Spark: [personal moment]
   - Stakes: [why now]
   - Zoom: [universal context]
   - Thesis: [where we're going]
   
   Section 1 (300-400w): [What changed / Context]
   Section 2 (500-700w): [Practical tools/methods]
   Section 3 (200-300w): [Caja de Acción]
   
   Closing (50-100w): [Reframe + CTA]
   ```

## Reference Files Guide

All reference files are in `references/`:

- **`voice-analysis.md`**: Voice fingerprint, 10 core rules, when/why to break them. Use for any voice question.

- **`structure-patterns.md`**: 3 main structures (Transformation Arc, Deep Dive, Reflective), opening/closing formulas, transition toolkit. Use when structuring or outlining.

- **`content-patterns.md`**: Topic territories, evidence hierarchy, signature examples, content gaps. Use for topic fit and evidence selection.

- **`style-guide.md`**: Style sheet, signature phrases, punctuation rules, writing approach. Use for editing and maintaining consistent style.

- **`engagement-mechanics.md`**: Top 5 techniques, shareability checklist, reader journey, dead zones to avoid. Use for maximizing impact.

- **`eli5-principle.md`**: How to be specific for experts while accessible to newcomers. Use when writing technical content.

- **`headline-guidelines.md`**: Creating intellectual tension, what works/doesn't, test questions. Use for any headline work.

- **`writing-principles.md`**: Core principles (Optimistic Realism, Intellectual Generosity, Conversational Authority) and avoiding empty antitheses. Use as foundational check.

## Working with the User

### Ask clarifying questions when:
- Multiple structures could work
- Topic could go multiple directions  
- Unclear what level of technical depth to use
- Ambiguous whether to use English or Spanish for a term

### Challenge ideas that feel:
- Too generic or could be from any tech blog
- Missing cultural grounding
- Overly formal or not conversational
- Heavy on theory without practical examples

### Help the user sound like themselves by:
- Pointing out when something sounds "AI-ish"
- Suggesting specific cultural references that fit
- Catching empty antitheses
- Ensuring technical terms get immediate context
- Adding vulnerability to technical achievements

## Quality Standards

Every piece should:
- [ ] Pass the "coffee test" - sound like something you'd say to a friend
- [ ] Balance vulnerability with expertise
- [ ] Ground every abstraction in concrete examples
- [ ] Define technical terms on first use
- [ ] Include cultural grounding
- [ ] Use Spanish first, English only when necessary
- [ ] Avoid empty antitheses and AI-generic language
- [ ] Create genuine intellectual tension (not clickbait)
- [ ] Show process, not just results
- [ ] End with reframe, not recap

## Important Notes

- **Read before writing**: Always read relevant reference files before generating content
- **Multiple reference files**: Most tasks require reading 2-4 reference files
- **Voice over perfection**: Authentic voice matters more than polished prose
- **Context is everything**: Technical content needs immediate explanation
- **Cultural specificity**: Use real cultural references, not generic "Latino culture"
- **No AI clichés**: Avoid "It's important to note", "In conclusion", "Furthermore"

The goal is helping the user write content that sounds authentically like tacosdedatos - bilingual, technically deep yet accessible, vulnerably confident, and culturally grounded.
