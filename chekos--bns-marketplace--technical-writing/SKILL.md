# Technical Writing Skill

## Core Philosophy

> "Every engineer is also a writer." — Google Technical Writing

Technical writing is a learnable skill, not an innate talent. The goal is clear, effective communication that helps readers accomplish tasks.

## Fundamental Principles

### Clarity First
- Say what you mean, simply and directly
- Use short sentences (aim for under 26 words)
- One idea per sentence
- Prefer active voice over passive voice

### Know Your Audience
- **Experts**: Can handle jargon, focus on new information
- **Intermediate**: Explain context, define terms on first use
- **Beginners**: Start from fundamentals, no assumptions

### Structure for Scanning
- Use descriptive headings
- Lead with the main point
- Use bullet points for lists (3+ items)
- Use numbered lists for sequences

## Writing Guidelines

### Word Choice
```
Avoid              → Prefer
utilize            → use
leverage           → use
in order to        → to
prior to           → before
subsequent         → after
facilitate         → help, enable
regarding          → about
in the event that  → if
```

### Technical Terms
- Define jargon on first use
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Create a glossary for complex documents
- Bold terms on first definition

### Pronouns
- Use "you" for the reader
- Use "we" sparingly (only when appropriate)
- Avoid ambiguous pronouns (it, this, that)
- Be explicit about what you're referring to

## Code Documentation

### Inline Comments
```python
# BAD: What the code does (obvious)
x = x + 1  # increment x

# GOOD: Why it's done
x = x + 1  # Account for zero-indexing in display
```

### Function Documentation
```python
def calculate_metrics(data: pd.DataFrame, threshold: float = 0.5) -> dict:
    """Calculate accuracy and precision metrics from prediction data.

    Args:
        data: DataFrame with 'actual' and 'predicted' columns
        threshold: Classification threshold for binary predictions

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing 'accuracy', 'precision', and 'recall' keys

    Raises:
        ValueError: If required columns are missing

    Example:
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'actual': [1, 0, 1], 'predicted': [0.8, 0.3, 0.6]})
        >>> metrics = calculate_metrics(df)
        >>> print(metrics['accuracy'])
        0.667
    """
```

### Code Blocks in Tutorials
- Always specify the language tag
- Provide context before the code
- Show expected output when helpful
- Keep examples focused (one concept at a time)

## Tutorial Structure

### Standard Format
```markdown
# [Tutorial Title]

## What You'll Learn
- Outcome 1
- Outcome 2
- Outcome 3

## Prerequisites
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2

## Setup
[Environment setup instructions]

## Step 1: [First Action]
[Explanation]
[Code]
[Result]

## Step 2: [Second Action]
[Continue pattern...]

## Complete Example
[Full working code]

## Next Steps
[Where to go from here]

## Resources
[Further reading]
```

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Start with an action verb (Install, Create, Run)
2. Be specific about what to do
3. Show the expected result
4. Handle common errors

## Explaining Complex Concepts

### The Analogy Approach
1. Identify the core concept
2. Find a familiar analogue
3. Map the comparison explicitly
4. Note where the analogy breaks down

### Example
```markdown
**DataFrame** is like a spreadsheet:
- Rows are individual records
- Columns are fields/variables
- Unlike spreadsheets, operations apply to entire columns at once
```

### The Progressive Disclosure Pattern
1. Simple definition (one sentence)
2. Expanded explanation (one paragraph)
3. Concrete example
4. Edge cases and nuances
5. Advanced usage

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing technical content:
- [ ] All code examples have been tested
- [ ] Language tags on all code blocks
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Jargon defined on first use
- [ ] Active voice predominant
- [ ] Steps are in logical order
- [ ] Prerequisites clearly stated
- [ ] Expected outputs shown
- [ ] Links to further resources

## Accessibility

### For Code
- Use semantic code block formatting
- Avoid color as the only differentiator
- Provide alt text for code images (never use images of code)

### For Content
- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Provide text alternatives for diagrams
- Use sufficient color contrast

## Spanish Language Considerations

### Technical Terms
- Keep widely-used English terms (API, DataFrame, commit)
- Translate conceptual terms (flujo de trabajo, conjunto de datos)
- Be consistent with term choices

### Code vs. Prose
- Code remains in English
- Variable names in English
- Comments can be in Spanish for Spanish tutorials
- Explanatory prose in Spanish
