# Predictive Modeling

This skill provides a comprehensive framework for developing, validating, and deploying predictive algorithms and clinical indices in healthcare settings. It bridges the gap between statistical theory and practical clinical application.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Reference | Considerations |
|-------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Problem Definition** | Define objective, target population, outcome | [Tutorial](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#problem-definition) | Clinical relevance, regulatory path |
| **Data Collection** | Dataset selection, inclusion criteria | [Tutorial](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#data-collection) | Data quality, bias assessment |
| **Feature Engineering** | Select predictors, transform variables | [Tutorial](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#feature-engineering) | Clinical interpretability |
| **Model Selection** | Algorithm comparison, complexity vs performance | [Tutorial](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#model-selection) | Explainability requirements |
| **Validation** | Train/test split, cross-validation, external validation | [Tutorial](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#validation) | Overfitting prevention |
| **Evaluation** | Metrics, calibration, discrimination | [Tutorial](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#evaluation) | Clinical utility assessment |
| **Case Study** | Real-world example: COVID-19 severity index | [Example](references/example-covid-index.md) | Lessons learned |

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:

*   **Develop Clinical Decision Support Tools**: Create algorithms to assist clinicians in diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment selection.
*   **Create Risk Stratification Scores**: Build indices to classify patients into risk categories (e.g., low, medium, high risk) for targeted interventions.
*   **Predict Patient Outcomes**: Model the likelihood of specific events such as mortality, hospital readmission, disease progression, or complications.
*   **Automate Diagnostic Screening**: Develop algorithms to flag potential cases of a condition based on electronic health record (EHR) data or other inputs.
*   **Analyze Feature Importance**: Understand which clinical factors are most strongly associated with an outcome.

## How to Use

Follow this step-by-step workflow to develop a robust predictive model:

1.  **Define the Clinical Question**: clearly articulate what you are predicting, for whom, and why. Refer to the [Problem Definition](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#problem-definition) section.
2.  **Prepare Your Data**: Gather retrospective data, clean it, and handle missing values. See [Data Collection](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#data-collection).
3.  **Engineer Features**: Transform raw data into clinically meaningful predictors. Consult [Feature Engineering](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#feature-engineering).
4.  **Select and Train Models**: Choose appropriate algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and train them. Use the [Model Selection](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#model-selection) guide.
5.  **Validate Rigorously**: Perform internal and external validation to ensure generalizability. Follow the [Validation](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#validation) protocols.
6.  **Evaluate Performance**: Assess the model using metrics like AUC-ROC, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. See [Evaluation](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#evaluation).
7.  **Review Real-World Application**: Study the [COVID-19 Severity Index Case Study](references/example-covid-index.md) to understand how these steps come together in practice.

## Algorithm Development Phases

This section outlines the core phases of development, linking to the detailed tutorial for in-depth guidance.

### 1. Problem Definition & Study Design
Before writing code, you must define the clinical use case.
*   **Target Population**: Who is the model for? (e.g., "Adult patients admitted with COVID-19")
*   **Outcome Variable**: What are you predicting? (e.g., "In-hospital mortality", "ICU admission within 24 hours")
*   **Time Horizon**: When is the prediction made, and for what future window?
*   **[Read more in the Tutorial](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#problem-definition)**

### 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing
High-quality data is the foundation of any model.
*   **Data Sources**: EHR, registries, claims data.
*   **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**: Applying clinical logic to filter the cohort.
*   **Missing Data Handling**: Imputation strategies vs. complete case analysis.
*   **[Read more in the Tutorial](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#data-collection)**

### 3. Feature Engineering & Selection
Transforming raw variables into predictive features.
*   **Domain Knowledge**: Incorporating clinical expertise (e.g., calculating BMI from height and weight).
*   **Dimensionality Reduction**: Selecting the most relevant features to prevent overfitting.
*   **Univariate Analysis**: Screening variables for association with the outcome.
*   **[Read more in the Tutorial](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#feature-engineering)**

### 4. Model Development
Training the algorithm.
*   **Algorithm Choice**: Logistic Regression (interpretable) vs. Gradient Boosting/Neural Networks (high performance).
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model configuration.
*   **Ensemble Methods**: Combining models for better stability.
*   **[Read more in the Tutorial](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#model-selection)**

### 5. Validation & Evaluation
Proving the model works.
*   **Internal Validation**: Cross-validation, bootstrapping.
*   **External Validation**: Testing on a separate dataset (different hospital, different time period).
*   **Performance Metrics**: Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, NPV, AUC-ROC, Calibration Slope/Intercept.
*   **[Read more in the Tutorial](references/tutorial-predictive-algorithm-development.md#validation)**

## Case Study: COVID-19 Severity Index

To see these principles applied in a real-world scenario, refer to the **[COVID-19 Severity Index Case Study](references/example-covid-index.md)**.

This case study demonstrates:
*   **Rapid Development**: How a team moved from problem definition to a deployed model during a pandemic.
*   **Variable Selection**: Choosing practical, widely available lab values (e.g., LDH, CRP, Lymphocyte count).
*   **Score Creation**: Converting a logistic regression model into a simple integer-based point score for bedside use.
*   **Validation**: How the model performed on an external validation cohort.
