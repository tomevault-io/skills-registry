# Commit Message Generator

Generate commit messages from staged changes following Conventional Commits.

## Workflow

1. **Get staged diff**
   - Run `git diff --cached`
   - If output is empty, inform user there are no staged changes and exit

2. **Generate commit message**
   - Analyze the diff content
   - Apply the rules below to produce a commit message

3. **Confirm and commit**
   - Display the generated commit message
   - Ask user to confirm, edit, or cancel
   - Only commit after user confirmation
   - Run `git commit -m "<message>"`

## Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Type Reference

| Type       | Use Case                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature                              |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                  |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                       |
| `style`    | Code style (formatting, no logic change) |
| `refactor` | Code refactor (no feature/fix)           |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                  |
| `test`     | Add/modify tests                         |
| `ci`       | CI/CD changes                            |
| `chore`    | Build, deps, tooling                     |

## Rules

### Subject

- Max 50 characters, imperative mood, lowercase first letter, no period
- Be specific: reference concrete identifiers from the diff (function names, file names, module names)
- FORBIDDEN: vague subjects like "update code", "fix bug", "make changes", "minor updates"

### Body

- **Default: NO body.** Most commits need only a subject line.
- Add body ONLY when:
  - Multi-file changes need explanation of how they relate
  - Breaking change requires migration notes
  - The reason for the change is not obvious from the diff
- Body explains WHY, never repeats WHAT the diff shows
- Max 3 lines

### Scope

- Use the module or directory name as scope (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`)
- If changes span multiple modules, omit scope

### Breaking Change

- Add `!` after type/scope: `feat(api)!: restructure response format`
- Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer with migration details

## Examples

**Subject only (most commits):**

```
docs(guide): add Python async programming guide
```

**With body (multi-file, needs context):**

```
refactor(auth): extract token validation into middleware

Move validation logic from individual route handlers to shared
middleware. Reduces duplication across 5 endpoint files.
```

**Breaking change:**

```
feat(api)!: switch response envelope to JSON:API format

BREAKING CHANGE: response shape changed from {data, status} to {data, meta}.
Update all API clients to use new structure.
```
