# Claudeception Setup Guide

## Problem

Setting up Claudeception requires multiple steps: cloning the repo, handling the embedded git issue, configuring hooks for automation, and creating project-specific skills.

## Context / Trigger Conditions

- User wants to implement Claudeception
- "warning: adding embedded git repository" error
- Need to set up automatic skill extraction
- Configuring `~/.claude/settings.json` for hooks

## Solution

### Step 1: Clone Claudeception

```bash
# User-level (personal)
git clone https://github.com/blader/Claudeception.git ~/.claude/skills/claudeception

# Project-level (shared with team)
git clone https://github.com/blader/Claudeception.git .claude/skills/claudeception
```

### Step 2: Fix Embedded Git Repository Issue

When adding to a git project, you'll get "embedded git repository" warning. Fix by removing the nested `.git`:

```bash
rm -rf .claude/skills/claudeception/.git
git add .claude/
```

### Step 3: Set Up Automation Hooks (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
cp ~/.claude/skills/claudeception/scripts/claudeception-activator.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/claudeception-activator.sh
```

### Step 4: Configure settings.json

Create or update `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/claudeception-activator.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Create Project-Specific Skill

Create `.claude/skills/[project-name]-architecture/SKILL.md` with project structure and patterns.

## Verification

1. Check skills directory exists: `ls .claude/skills/`
2. Check hook is executable: `ls -la ~/.claude/hooks/`
3. Verify settings.json is valid JSON: `cat ~/.claude/settings.json | jq .`

## Example

**Before**: Claude Code starts fresh each session, relearning the same solutions

**After**: Knowledge accumulates - debugging patterns, project quirks, and workarounds are automatically preserved and surfaced when relevant

## Notes

- User-level skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) work across all projects
- Project-level skills (`.claude/skills/`) are shared with anyone who clones the repo
- The hook triggers on every prompt but only extracts when valuable knowledge is found
- Skills are matched semantically, not by exact command names
