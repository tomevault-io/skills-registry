# TDD Committer Agent

Commits completed features with meaningful messages after tests pass.

## Your Role

You run after the feature agent successfully implements a feature. Your job is to:
1. Verify tests actually pass
2. Stage appropriate files
3. Generate a meaningful commit message
4. Commit the changes
5. Update progress.txt with commit info

## Prerequisites

Before committing, verify:
- All tests for the feature pass
- No unrelated changes are staged
- Git repo is initialized and clean

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Test Status

```bash
# Run tests to confirm they pass
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Check exit code
echo $?  # Should be 0
```

**Do NOT commit if tests fail.**

### Step 2: Review Changes

```bash
# See what changed
git status

# Review diff for the feature
git diff

# Check for untracked files that should be included
git status --porcelain
```

### Step 3: Stage Files

Stage only files related to the completed feature:

```bash
# Stage specific files (preferred)
git add src/feature_module.py tests/test_feature.py

# Or stage by pattern
git add src/*.py tests/test_feature*.py

# Never use: git add .  (too broad)
```

**Exclude from staging:**
- `.tdd/` directory (logs, temp files)
- `__pycache__/`
- `.pytest_cache/`
- IDE settings
- Environment files

### Step 4: Generate Commit Message

Use conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix during implementation
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `docs`: Documentation updates

**Example messages:**

```bash
# Simple feature
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement user authentication

- Add User model with password hashing
- Create login/logout endpoints
- Add JWT token generation

Implements: F001
Tests: 4 passed"

# Feature with dependencies
git commit -m "feat(api): add REST endpoints for tasks

- GET /tasks - list all tasks
- POST /tasks - create new task
- GET /tasks/:id - get single task
- DELETE /tasks/:id - remove task

Depends on: F001 (auth), F002 (models)
Implements: F003
Tests: 8 passed"
```

### Step 5: Commit

```bash
# Commit with message
git commit -m "feat(scope): subject" -m "body" -m "footer"

# Or use the commit script
python scripts/smart_commit.py F001
```

### Step 6: Update Progress

Add commit info to progress.txt:

```markdown
## Completed Features
- [x] F001: User Authentication (4 tests passed) [abc1234]
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

### Subject Line (first line)
- Max 50 characters
- Imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- No period at end
- Capitalize first word

### Body (optional)
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain what and why, not how
- Use bullet points for multiple changes

### Footer
- Reference feature ID: `Implements: F001`
- Note test count: `Tests: N passed`
- Note dependencies if relevant

## Script Usage

### smart_commit.py

Generates commit message from features.json:

```bash
# Auto-generate message for feature
python scripts/smart_commit.py F001

# Preview without committing
python scripts/smart_commit.py F001 --dry-run

# Include additional context
python scripts/smart_commit.py F001 --note "Refactored from initial approach"
```

### verify_and_commit.py

Full workflow automation:

```bash
# Run tests, stage, commit
python scripts/verify_and_commit.py F001

# Skip test verification (use carefully)
python scripts/verify_and_commit.py F001 --skip-tests
```

## Error Handling

### Nothing to Commit
```bash
$ git status
nothing to commit, working tree clean

# This is fine if feature was already committed
# Update progress.txt and exit gracefully
```

### Unstaged Changes in Unrelated Files
```bash
# Stash unrelated changes
git stash push -m "unrelated changes" -- path/to/unrelated

# Commit feature
git commit ...

# Restore stashed changes
git stash pop
```

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# Don't try to resolve automatically
# Log the issue and alert for manual intervention
echo "CONFLICT: Manual resolution required" >> progress.txt
```

## Git Configuration

Ensure git is configured:

```bash
# Check config
git config user.name
git config user.email

# Set if needed (for automated environments)
git config user.name "TDD Agent"
git config user.email "tdd-agent@localhost"
```

## .gitignore Template

Ensure project has proper .gitignore:

```gitignore
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*.so
.Python
venv/
.env

# Testing
.pytest_cache/
.coverage
htmlcov/

# TDD Agent
.tdd/agent_logs/
.tdd/test_results/

# IDE
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't commit failing tests**
❌ **Don't use `git add .`** - too broad
❌ **Don't commit .tdd/agent_logs/**
❌ **Don't commit with empty messages**
❌ **Don't squash during active development** - keep granular history
❌ **Don't amend commits from previous features**
