# PR Review Resolver

Automated workflow for handling CodeRabbit and Qodo PR review comments across all active repositories.

## Overview

This skill monitors PRs for review bot comments, evaluates suggestions, applies fixes intelligently, and resolves comments. It can run continuously in a ralph-loop until all issues are addressed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Resolve comments on a specific PR
/pr-resolve owner/repo#123

# Resolve comments on current branch's PR
/pr-resolve

# Run in continuous mode (ralph-loop)
/ralph-loop "/pr-resolve owner/repo#123 --loop"
```

## Supported Review Bots

| Bot | Detection | Comment Format |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| **CodeRabbit** | `coderabbitai[bot]` | Severity markers, diff blocks, committable suggestions |
| **Qodo** | `qodo-code-review[bot]` | Suggestion blocks with direct replacements |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery
```bash
# Find open PRs with pending review comments
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,author,headRefName

# Get review comments for a PR
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments
```

### Phase 2: Parse Comments

**CodeRabbit Format:**
```
_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🔴 Critical_
**Issue title**
Description...

<details>
<summary>🔧 Proposed fix</summary>

```diff
-old code
+new code
```
</details>
```

**Qodo Format:**
```
**Suggestion:** Title
```suggestion
replacement code here
```
```

### Phase 3: Evaluate Each Issue

For each comment, evaluate:

1. **Validity Check**
   - Is the suggestion syntactically correct?
   - Does the file/line still exist?
   - Has it already been addressed?

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Security issues (🔴 Critical) → High priority
   - Logic bugs (🟠 Major) → Medium priority  
   - Style/lint (🟡 Minor) → Lower priority

3. **Conflict Detection**
   - Check if multiple suggestions target same lines
   - Determine which takes precedence

### Phase 4: Apply Fixes

```bash
# Read the target file
cat path/to/file.py

# Apply the fix (evaluated, not blind)
# For diff blocks: parse and apply hunks
# For suggestion blocks: replace exact lines

# Commit with reference
git add path/to/file.py
git commit -m "fix: address CodeRabbit review - <issue summary>

Resolves review comment: <comment_url>"
```

### Phase 5: Resolve Comments

```bash
# Reply to comment indicating fix
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="✅ Fixed in commit $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)

Applied the suggested change. The issue has been addressed."

# Push changes
git push
```

### Phase 6: Loop Until Done

If running in ralph-loop mode:
1. Push changes
2. Wait for new review cycle (2-5 minutes)
3. Check for new comments
4. Repeat until no unresolved comments remain
5. Signal completion with `<promise>DONE</promise>`

## Comment Parsing Scripts

### Extract CodeRabbit Issues
```python
import re
import json

def parse_coderabbit_comment(body: str) -> dict:
    """Parse CodeRabbit comment into structured data."""
    result = {
        "severity": None,
        "title": None,
        "description": None,
        "diff": None,
        "suggestion": None
    }
    
    # Extract severity
    if "🔴 Critical" in body:
        result["severity"] = "critical"
    elif "🟠 Major" in body:
        result["severity"] = "major"
    elif "🟡 Minor" in body:
        result["severity"] = "minor"
    
    # Extract diff block
    diff_match = re.search(r'```diff\n(.*?)```', body, re.DOTALL)
    if diff_match:
        result["diff"] = diff_match.group(1)
    
    # Extract committable suggestion
    suggestion_match = re.search(
        r'📝 Committable suggestion.*?```\w*\n(.*?)```', 
        body, re.DOTALL
    )
    if suggestion_match:
        result["suggestion"] = suggestion_match.group(1)
    
    return result
```

### Extract Qodo Issues
```python
def parse_qodo_comment(body: str) -> dict:
    """Parse Qodo comment into structured data."""
    result = {
        "title": None,
        "suggestion": None
    }
    
    # Extract title
    title_match = re.search(r'\*\*Suggestion:\*\*\s*(.+)', body)
    if title_match:
        result["title"] = title_match.group(1).strip()
    
    # Extract suggestion block
    suggestion_match = re.search(r'```suggestion\n(.*?)```', body, re.DOTALL)
    if suggestion_match:
        result["suggestion"] = suggestion_match.group(1)
    
    return result
```

## Evaluation Criteria

### When to Apply a Suggestion

✅ **Apply when:**
- Suggestion is syntactically valid
- Target lines exist and match expected content
- Change doesn't introduce new issues
- Security fix (always prioritize)
- Clear bug fix with obvious improvement

⚠️ **Evaluate carefully when:**
- Suggestion conflicts with project conventions
- Multiple suggestions affect same code
- Change has broader implications
- Refactoring suggestion (may need context)

❌ **Skip when:**
- Target code has already changed
- Suggestion would break functionality
- False positive detection
- Requires human decision (architectural)

### Priority Order

1. 🔴 **Critical** - Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks
2. 🟠 **Major** - Logic bugs, error handling issues
3. 🟡 **Minor** - Style, lint, documentation

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub personal access token | Required |
| `PR_RESOLVE_AUTO_PUSH` | Auto-push after fixes | `true` |
| `PR_RESOLVE_WAIT_TIME` | Seconds to wait for new reviews | `300` |
| `PR_RESOLVE_MAX_ITERATIONS` | Max loop iterations | `10` |

## Integration with ralph-loop

This skill is designed to work with oh-my-opencode's ralph-loop:

```bash
/ralph-loop "/pr-resolve chipoto69/ATLAS-CORPUS#4"
```

The loop will:
1. Process all current comments
2. Push fixes
3. Wait for CodeRabbit/Qodo to re-review
4. Address any new comments
5. Repeat until `<promise>DONE</promise>`

## Files Modified

The skill creates no persistent files. All state is managed through:
- Git commits (fix history)
- GitHub API (comment status)
- PR conversation thread (resolution replies)

## Troubleshooting

### "Comment already resolved"
The comment may have been addressed in a previous run. Check git log for related commits.

### "Cannot apply diff - context mismatch"
The target code has changed since the review. Re-fetch the file and manually verify the fix.

### "Rate limited by GitHub API"
Wait for rate limit reset or use a token with higher limits.

### "Suggestion introduces syntax error"
Skip the suggestion and flag for human review. Log the issue.
