## Capabilities

### Code Statistics
- Lines of code by language
- File count and distribution
- Comment density
- Code complexity metrics

### Dependency Analysis
- Direct dependencies
- Dev dependencies
- Outdated packages
- Security vulnerabilities

### Git Analytics
- Total commits
- Contributors
- Activity timeline
- Commit frequency patterns

### Architecture Detection
- Framework identification
- Design patterns used
- Module structure
- API surface

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze current project
/analyze

# Analyze specific project
/analyze --project ~/projects/my-app

# Generate full report
/analyze --full --output report.md
```

## Output Format

```yaml
