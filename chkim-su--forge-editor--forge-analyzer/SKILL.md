# Forge Analyzer

Understands what users actually need, not what category their project fits into.

## Philosophy

> **"What problem are you solving?"** - not "Is this a skill or an agent?"

Architecture emerges from understanding, not from matching patterns to templates.

---

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- User has a vague or ambiguous request
- Wizard cannot determine the right route from pattern matching
- User says things like "I want to make something that..." or "I'm not sure what I need"
- Need to clarify requirements before creating skill/agent/command

---

## Analysis Dimensions

Instead of categories, analyze along these dimensions:

### 1. State Complexity

| Question | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Does it need to remember across calls? | Persistent state needed |
| Is state shared between components? | Centralized management |
| Can it be stateless? | Simpler architecture |

### 2. Interaction Boundary

| Question | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Who initiates the interaction? | User → command/skill; System → hook/daemon |
| How long does interaction last? | One-shot → skill; Ongoing → agent/session |
| Does it need external systems? | External → MCP/API integration |

### 3. Context Requirements

| Question | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| How much context does it need? | Large → isolated agent; Small → inline skill |
| Is context shareable? | Shareable → skill; Isolated → subagent |
| Does it build on previous context? | Building → session state; Fresh → stateless |

### 4. Execution Pattern

| Question | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Synchronous or async? | Sync → direct; Async → background/daemon |
| Single task or workflow? | Single → function; Workflow → orchestration |
| Needs human in the loop? | HITL → interactive; Autonomous → agent |

### 5. Integration Surface

| Question | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| What triggers it? | User input → command; Tool use → hook; Time → cron |
| What does it produce? | Text → response; Files → write; Actions → tool calls |
| What does it consume? | Files → read; APIs → fetch; User → ask |

---

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask open-ended questions:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What problem does this solve for you?"
  header: "Problem"
  options:
    - label: "Automate repetitive task"
      description: "Something I do often that could be automatic"
    - label: "Enforce a rule"
      description: "Prevent mistakes or ensure quality"
    - label: "Provide information"
      description: "Answer questions or give guidance"
    - label: "Connect systems"
      description: "Bridge between different tools/services"
```

### Step 2: Map Dimensions

```
State:        [stateless] -------- [session] -------- [persistent]
Interaction:  [reactive] --------- [interactive] ---- [proactive]
Context:      [minimal] ---------- [moderate] ------- [extensive]
Execution:    [sync] ------------- [mixed] ---------- [async]
Integration:  [internal] --------- [hybrid] --------- [external]
```

### Step 3: Derive Architecture & Route to Wizard

| Pattern | Dimension Profile | Wizard Route |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **Skill (Knowledge)** | Stateless + Minimal context + Sync | SKILL → skill-architect |
| **Skill (Tool)** | State + Script needed + Sync | SKILL → skill-architect |
| **Agent** | Extensive context + Any execution | AGENT → skill-orchestrator-designer |
| **Hook** | Reactive + Rule enforcement + Sync | HOOK_DESIGN |
| **LLM Integration** | External + Async + API | LLM_INTEGRATION |
| **Workflow** | Multi-step + Mixed execution | COMMAND |
| **Hybrid** | Conflicting requirements | architecture-smith agent |

## Output Format

After analysis, recommend and route. **Connection Plan is MANDATORY**:

```markdown
## Forge Analysis Result

### Problem Understanding
{Summary of what the user needs}

### Dimension Analysis
- State: {spectrum position} - {reason}
- Interaction: {spectrum position} - {reason}
- Context: {spectrum position} - {reason}
- Execution: {spectrum position} - {reason}
- Integration: {spectrum position} - {reason}

### Recommended Architecture
{Specific recommendation}

### Connection Plan (REQUIRED)
| Registration | Location | Status |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| {type} | {file path} | [ ] Pending |

Entry points:
- {How users/system will access this component}

### Next Step
1. Wire connections (registrations above)
2. Create component via: {Wizard route or agent}
3. Verify with validate_all.py
```

---

## Integration with Wizard

After forge analysis completes:

| Architecture | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Skill | Route to SKILL → `Task(subagent_type: "skill-architect")` |
| Agent | Route to AGENT → `Task(subagent_type: "skill-orchestrator-designer")` |
| Hook | Route to HOOK_DESIGN |
| Complex/Hybrid | `Task(subagent_type: "architecture-smith")` for deep analysis |

---

## Connectivity-First Design

> **CRITICAL**: Every component must be connected at creation time, not validated later.

When creating ANY component, verify connectivity BEFORE implementation:

### Connection Checklist

| Component Type | Must Connect To | Validation |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Skill** | wizard routes, marketplace.json agents | W046 unreferenced check |
| **Agent** | plugin.json agents[], marketplace.json agents | E001 undefined agent |
| **Command** | plugin.json commands[], marketplace.json commands | E002 undefined command |
| **Hook script** | hooks/hooks.json matchers | W046 orphaned script |
| **Reference file** | Parent SKILL.md or agent.md | W046 disconnected file |

### Pre-Creation Questions

Before creating any component:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "How will this component be accessed?"
  header: "Connectivity"
  options:
    - label: "Via wizard route"
      description: "Route pattern in wizard SKILL.md"
    - label: "Via command"
      description: "User runs /plugin:command"
    - label: "Via agent spawning"
      description: "Task(subagent_type: 'name')"
    - label: "Automatically via hooks"
      description: "Triggered by tool use patterns"
```

### Connection Blueprint

When recommending architecture, ALWAYS include connection plan:

```markdown
## Connection Plan

### 1. Entry Points
- Wizard route: `{pattern}` → ROUTE_NAME
- Command: `/plugin:{name}`
- Agent spawn: `Task(subagent_type: "{name}")`

### 2. Required Registrations
- [ ] plugin.json → agents[] or commands[]
- [ ] marketplace.json → agents[] or commands[]
- [ ] wizard SKILL.md → routing table (if applicable)
- [ ] hooks.json → matchers (if hook script)

### 3. Internal References
- Parent skill/agent → references/
- Skill loading: Skill("plugin:{name}")
```

### Creation Workflow

```
1. Determine component type from dimension analysis
2. Generate connection blueprint
3. Present blueprint to user for confirmation
4. Create component WITH connections (not after)
5. Run validate_all.py to confirm connectivity
```

### Why Connectivity-First?

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Create → Validate later | Orphaned components, W046 warnings, forgotten registration |
| Create → Hope wizard finds it | Components invisible to routing |
| Create → Manual wiring | Human error, inconsistent naming |
| **Connectivity-First** | Components work immediately, no orphans |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Trap | Problem | Better Approach |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Category-first | "Is this a skill?" | "What does it need to do?" |
| Template-matching | "This looks like X" | "What are the actual requirements?" |
| Over-engineering | "Let's add flexibility" | "What's the minimum that works?" |
| Under-engineering | "Just make it simple" | "What complexity is unavoidable?" |
| **Create-then-wire** | Orphaned components | Wire first, create second |
