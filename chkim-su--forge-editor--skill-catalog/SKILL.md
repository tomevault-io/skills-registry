# Claude Code Global Skill System

Claude Code maintains a **global skill registry**. All installed skills are automatically available.

```
System Prompt (자동 포함):
<available_skills>
  <skill><name>skill-name</name><description>...</description></skill>
  ...
</available_skills>
```

**No discovery needed** - Claude already knows all skills.

# Skill Sources

| Source | Location | Registration |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Plugin Skills | `~/.claude/plugins/*/skills/` | marketplace.json `skills` array |
| User Skills | `~/.claude/skills/` | Automatic |
| Project Skills | `.claude/skills/` | Automatic |

All sources merge into a single global registry accessible via `Skill` tool.

2. **Categorize by domain** - Help users find relevant skills
3. **Prefer plugin:skill format** - Avoid naming conflicts
