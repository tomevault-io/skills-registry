# Fetching PR reviews

Fetches PR review comments for the git project from GitHub and formats them as
LLM-friendly markdown.

## Primary usage

Get the last review in GitHub by the current user for an open Pull Request for the current branch in the git repository

```bash
repo-to-md review --author @me
```

The command can be executed anywhere in the repository. There is no need to
change the working directory.

## Prerequisites

If the command fails, please note potential failure cases:

- `gh` CLI must be installed and authenticated
- `repo-to-md` must be run from within a git repository with a configured
  remote

The tool auto-detects the repository from `git remote get-url origin` and the
current user from the authentication used for the `gh` command.

## Alternative usage

The command has many options

- `--author <USERNAME>` to filter the reviews by author
- `--pr-number <PR NUMBER>` to select a specific PR by number
- `--repo <REPOSTITORY>` to select the repository as `owner/repo`
- `--review <INDEX OR ID>` to select a specific review

Examples:

```bash
# select the review for the current branch in the repo chmp/repo-to-md
repo-to-md review --repo chmp/repo-to-md

# selecth the pull request number 6
repo-to-md review --pr 6
```

## Output format

Generates markdown with file sections containing code context and embedded
review comments:

````markdown
## `src/main.rs` - Lines 10-15

```rust
pub fn main() {
// <review>
// Consider using clap for argument parsing
// </review>
    println!("Hello");
}
```
````

Each comment is embedded as `<review>...</review>` XML tags using the
language-specific comment syntax.
