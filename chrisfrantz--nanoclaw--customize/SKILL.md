# NanoClaw Customization

This skill helps users add capabilities or modify behavior. Use AskUserQuestion to understand what they want before making changes.

## Workflow

1. **Understand the request** - Ask clarifying questions
2. **Plan the changes** - Identify files to modify
3. **Implement** - Make changes directly to the code
4. **Test guidance** - Tell user how to verify

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/config.ts` | Assistant name, trigger pattern, directories |
| `src/index.ts` | Message routing, WhatsApp connection, agent invocation |
| `src/db.ts` | Database initialization and queries |
| `src/types.ts` | TypeScript interfaces |
| `src/whatsapp-auth.ts` | Standalone WhatsApp authentication script |
| `groups/MEMORY.md` | Global memory/persona |

## Common Customization Patterns

### Adding a New Input Channel (e.g., Telegram, Slack, Email)

Questions to ask:
- Which channel? (Telegram, Slack, Discord, email, SMS, etc.)
- Same trigger word or different?
- Same memory hierarchy or separate?
- Should messages from this channel go to existing groups or new ones?

Implementation pattern:
1. Find/add connector or API client for the channel
2. Add connection and message handling in `src/index.ts`
3. Store messages in the database (update `src/db.ts` if needed)
4. Ensure responses route back to correct channel

### Adding a New Integration

Questions to ask:
- What service? (Calendar, Notion, database, etc.)
- What operations needed? (read, write, both)
- Which groups should have access?

Implementation:
1. Add host-side integration and authentication
2. Expose it via IPC actions (update the agent response schema + action handling)
3. Document in `groups/MEMORY.md`

### Changing Assistant Behavior

Questions to ask:
- What aspect? (name, trigger, persona, response style)
- Apply to all groups or specific ones?

Simple changes → edit `src/config.ts`
Persona changes → edit `groups/MEMORY.md`
Per-group behavior → edit specific group's `MEMORY.md`

### Adding New Commands

Questions to ask:
- What should the command do?
- Available in all groups or main only?
- Does it need new IPC actions?

Implementation:
1. Add command handling in `processMessage()` in `src/index.ts`
2. Check for the command before the trigger pattern check

### Changing Deployment

Questions to ask:
- Target platform? (Linux server, Docker, different Mac)
- Service manager? (systemd, Docker, supervisord)

Implementation:
1. Create appropriate service files
2. Update paths in config
3. Provide setup instructions

## After Changes

Always tell the user:
```bash
# Rebuild and restart
npm run build
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
```

## Example Interaction

User: "Add Telegram as an input channel"

1. Ask: "Should Telegram use the same @Andy trigger, or a different one?"
2. Ask: "Should Telegram messages create separate conversation contexts, or share with WhatsApp groups?"
3. Find Telegram MCP or library
4. Add connection handling in index.ts
5. Update message storage in db.ts
6. Tell user how to authenticate and test
