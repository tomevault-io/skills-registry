# Review Trufflehog Secret Findings

Expert security analysis workflow for triaging Trufflehog secret detection results, distinguishing real credential exposures from test/demo data.

## Project Structure

All paths are relative to the project root (working directory):

```
threat_hunting/                    # Project root (working directory)
├── <org-name>/                    # Cloned repositories (e.g., jitsi/, tronprotocol/)
│   └── <repo-name>/               # Individual repository source code
├── findings/<org-name>/           # All scan results for an organization
│   ├── semgrep-results/
│   ├── trufflehog-results/        # Trufflehog NDJSON output files
│   │   └── <repo-name>.json
│   ├── artifact-results/
│   ├── kics-results/
│   └── reports/                   # Final consolidated reports
└── scripts/                       # ALL extraction and scanning scripts
```

**Repository source code location**: `<org-name>/<repo-name>/` (e.g., `jitsi/jicofo/src/main/java/...`)
**Scan results location**: `findings/<org-name>/trufflehog-results/<repo-name>.json`

## CRITICAL: Do NOT Write Custom Scripts

**All extraction scripts already exist in `./scripts/`**. Never write custom jq, Python, or shell scripts to parse findings. The existing scripts handle:
- Complex JSON/NDJSON parsing
- Large file handling
- Edge cases and error handling
- Consistent output formatting

Available extraction scripts:
- `./scripts/extract-semgrep-findings.sh` - Parse semgrep results
- `./scripts/extract-trufflehog-findings.sh` - Parse trufflehog results
- `./scripts/extract-artifact-findings.sh` - Parse artifact results
- `./scripts/extract-kics-findings.sh` - Parse KICS results

If you need functionality not provided by existing scripts, ask the user to update the scripts rather than writing one-off solutions.

## CRITICAL: Always Use the Extraction Script First

**MANDATORY**: Before doing ANY manual analysis, you MUST run the extraction script to get a summary of findings:

```bash
./scripts/extract-trufflehog-findings.sh <org-name>
```

This script:
- Parses all NDJSON result files efficiently
- Shows verification status, secret type, file location
- Provides total counts and summary statistics
- Handles empty files and edge cases automatically

**DO NOT** attempt to read NDJSON files directly or use Grep to parse them. The extraction script handles the format automatically.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Extract from findings/ directory (per-repo NDJSON files)
./scripts/extract-trufflehog-findings.sh <org-name>                  # All repos, summary
./scripts/extract-trufflehog-findings.sh <org-name> verified         # Only verified secrets
./scripts/extract-trufflehog-findings.sh <org-name> summary <repo>   # Specific repo
./scripts/extract-trufflehog-findings.sh <org-name> count            # Counts only

# Extract from catalog scans (merged gzipped NDJSON)
./scripts/extract-trufflehog-findings.sh <org-name> --catalog         # Latest scan
./scripts/extract-trufflehog-findings.sh <org-name> --scan 2025-12-24 # Specific scan

# Scan repositories (if not already done)
./scripts/scan-secrets.sh <org-name>
```

**Data Sources:**
- `findings/<org>/trufflehog-results/*.json` - Per-repo NDJSON (uncompressed)
- `catalog/tracked/<org>/scans/<timestamp>/trufflehog.json.gz` - Merged scan (gzipped NDJSON)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Run the Extraction Script and Verify Counts

**ALWAYS START HERE** - Run the extraction script with count format first:

```bash
# Step 1a: Get counts to verify total findings
./scripts/extract-trufflehog-findings.sh <org-name> count

# Step 1b: Then get the full summary
./scripts/extract-trufflehog-findings.sh <org-name>
```

**CRITICAL COUNT VERIFICATION**: The summary output shows "Total: N findings (M verified)" at the bottom. The total MUST match the sum of all counts from step 1a. If they don't match, the extraction may be truncating results - investigate before proceeding.

Review the script output to understand:
- Total number of findings and verified secrets
- Which repos have the most exposures
- Types of secrets detected (AWS, GitHub, PrivateKey, etc.)

**Note**: Findings are sorted by verification status (VERIFIED first). All verified secrets appear at the top of the output for immediate attention.

**For verified secrets** (confirmed active - highest priority):
```bash
./scripts/extract-trufflehog-findings.sh <org-name> verified
```

### Step 2: Triage Findings

#### Priority by Secret Type

**NOTE**: These priorities assume PRODUCTION credentials. Downgrade by 1-2 levels for development/staging credentials (see "Development vs Production Credentials" below).

1. **CRITICAL** - Rotate immediately:
   - Cloud provider keys (AWS, GCP, Azure) - *in production*
   - Database credentials - *in production*
   - Private keys (SSH, TLS, signing) - *for production systems*
   - Payment system keys (Stripe live keys, etc.)

2. **HIGH** - Rotate soon:
   - Auth tokens (JWT, OAuth) - *for production identity providers*
   - Service account credentials - *with production access*
   - API keys for sensitive services

3. **MEDIUM** - Investigate:
   - Third-party SaaS API keys
   - Webhook secrets
   - **Development/staging credentials for critical services** (e.g., dev AWS keys)

4. **LOW** - Verify context:
   - Free-tier service keys
   - Read-only tokens
   - **Development-only credentials** (e.g., local dev tokens, sandbox APIs)
   - Test keys (Stripe `sk_test_`, etc.)

#### Filter Test/Demo Secrets

**Likely TEST DATA - Lower priority:**

Filename indicators:
- `test`, `spec`, `mock`, `fake`, `dummy`, `example`, `sample`
- `fixture`, `stub`, `demo`, `.test.`, `.spec.`
- `__tests__`, `__mocks__`, `testdata`, `fixtures`
- `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, `.env.template`

Content indicators:
- Placeholder patterns: `xxx`, `000`, `test`, `demo`, `changeme`
- Known dummy values: `sk_test_`, `pk_test_`, `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`
- Documentation/README files with example code

**Likely REAL - Prioritize:**
- Production config files
- Non-template environment files
- Application source code
- CI/CD configuration
- Verified status = true

#### Development vs Production Credentials

**IMPORTANT**: Even verified secrets may be LOW priority if they are development credentials. A "verified" status only means the credential is valid/active - it does NOT indicate production access or criticality.

**Development environment indicators (downgrade to MEDIUM/LOW):**

Token naming patterns:
- `dev`, `development`, `staging`, `sandbox`, `preview`
- `nonprod`, `non-prod`, `non_prod`
- `local`, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`
- Service-specific: `_dev_`, `-dev-`, `.dev.`

Context clues in surrounding code:
- Environment checks like `if ENV == 'development'`
- Comments mentioning "dev", "test", "local"
- Conditional loading based on environment variables
- URLs pointing to dev/staging domains

Service-specific dev patterns:
- **Auth0/Okta**: Dev tenant tokens (look for tenant names containing `dev`, `test`, or non-production domains)
- **Stripe**: `sk_test_`, `pk_test_` prefixes
- **AWS**: Keys associated with dev accounts or sandbox IAM roles
- **Firebase**: Projects with `-dev`, `-staging` suffixes
- **Twilio**: Test credentials (specific test SIDs)

**Why dev credentials are lower priority:**
1. **Limited blast radius** - Dev environments typically contain synthetic/test data, not real user data
2. **Intentionally permissive** - Dev credentials are often shared/less protected by design
3. **Lower bounty value** - Most programs pay less (or nothing) for dev environment access
4. **Already assumed compromised** - Security teams often assume dev credentials leak

**When dev credentials ARE still reportable:**
- Dev credential provides path to production (shared secrets, privilege escalation)
- Dev environment contains copies of real production data
- Program explicitly includes dev/staging in scope
- Dev credential reveals production infrastructure details

### Step 3: Deep Analysis

For each non-test finding, examine the source code:

#### Read Context
- Read the source file at the reported location
- Examine 30+ lines of surrounding context
- Check the commit history

#### Determine Real-World Risk

**Is this secret actually used?**
- Hardcoded and used directly → HIGH RISK
- Loaded from env var with hardcoded fallback → Check if fallback is real
- In gitignored file that was committed → Still exposed in history

**What's the blast radius?**
- What systems/data can this credential access?
- Is it scoped (read-only, limited permissions)?
- Organizational vs. personal credential?

**Exposure timeline:**
- How long has it been in version control?
- Is the repository public or private?
- Has the secret been rotated since exposure?

### Step 4: Report Findings

**For VERIFIED secrets (immediate action):**

```
## VERIFIED SECRET - [Secret Type]

**Repository**: repo-name
**File:Line**: path/to/file.py:123
**Commit**: abc123def (date)
**Partial Secret**: AKIA...

**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Blast Radius**: [What this credential can access]

**Analysis**: Why this requires immediate action

**Recommendation**:
1. Rotate credential immediately
2. Audit access logs for unauthorized use
3. Remove from repository history if public
```

**For UNVERIFIED secrets (likely real):**

```
## UNVERIFIED - LIKELY REAL - [Secret Type]

**Repository**: repo-name
**File:Line**: path/to/file.py:123
**Confidence**: 85%

**Analysis**: Why this appears to be a real credential

**Recommendation**: Verify and rotate if confirmed
```

**For filtered test/demo secrets:**

```
## FILTERED - TEST/DEMO

**File**: path/to/test_config.py
**Reason**: Test file with placeholder value `sk_test_...`
```

**Final Summary:**
- Total findings reviewed
- Verified secrets requiring immediate rotation
- Unverified secrets requiring investigation
- Filtered test/demo secrets
- Repositories with most exposures
- Patterns observed (e.g., "AWS keys in config files")

## Output Formats

**Extraction script formats:**
- `summary` (default) - Readable finding details
- `verified` - Only confirmed active secrets
- `count` - Counts per repository
- `full` - Raw JSON for detailed analysis

## Reference

### NDJSON Format (For Understanding Output)

Trufflehog outputs newline-delimited JSON (one finding per line). Key fields in the extraction script output:

- `DetectorName`: Type of secret (AWS, GitHub, PrivateKey, etc.)
- `Verified`: Boolean - true means confirmed active
- `Raw`: The actual secret value (partially masked)
- `SourceMetadata.Data.Git.file`: File path
- `SourceMetadata.Data.Git.commit`: Commit hash
- `SourceMetadata.Data.Git.line`: Line number

**Note**: Do NOT manually parse NDJSON files - always use the extraction script.

## Guidelines

- **Verified secrets are confirmed real** - prioritize for immediate rotation
- Be aggressive about filtering test data, but document what was filtered
- When uncertain, err on the side of reporting (false positive > missed real secret)
- Check git history - "removed" secrets are still exposed in history
- Document your reasoning for each verdict
