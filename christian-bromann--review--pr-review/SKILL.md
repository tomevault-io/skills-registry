# PR Review Best Practices

## Review approach

1. **Read the PR description and linked issues first** — understand the intent
2. **Examine the full diff** via `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD`
3. **Read surrounding code** for context — don't review the diff in isolation
4. **Check tests** — new functionality should have test coverage
5. **Collect all comments**, then submit once — never post partial reviews

## What to look for

| Category | Examples |
| -------- | -------- |
| **Correctness** | Logic errors, off-by-one, wrong operator, missing null checks |
| **Security** | Injection, hardcoded secrets, unsafe deserialization, path traversal |
| **Performance** | O(n²) in hot paths, unnecessary allocations, missing indexes |
| **Error handling** | Swallowed exceptions, missing try/catch, unclear error messages |
| **Edge cases** | Empty arrays, undefined, NaN, concurrent access, large inputs |
| **API design** | Breaking changes, unclear naming, missing validation |
| **Type safety** | Usage of `any` type — flag every `any` as 🔴 Critical unless the file is a test file (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`). Prefer `unknown`, generics, or explicit types instead |
| **Tests** | Missing coverage, brittle assertions, tests that don't test anything |

## Severity levels

Use these prefixes consistently:

- **🔴 Critical** — Must fix. Bugs, security issues, data loss risk.
- **🟡 Suggestion** — Should consider. Improvements, better patterns, clearer naming.
- **🟢 Nit** — Optional. Style, minor readability, personal preference.

Start the comment body with the severity emoji so the reviewer can triage quickly.

## Code suggestions

When proposing a concrete fix, use GitHub's suggestion syntax so the author can apply it with one click:

````markdown
```suggestion
replacement code here (full lines, not a partial snippet)
```
````

Rules for suggestions:

- Include **complete replacement lines** (GitHub replaces the entire line range)
- **Preserve exact indentation** — the replacement code inside the suggestion block MUST have the same leading whitespace (spaces/tabs) as the original line in the diff. Look at the diff to count the exact number of leading spaces and replicate them. For example, if the original line has 6 spaces of indentation, the suggestion must also have exactly 6 spaces
- Only suggest on lines that appear in the diff (added or modified)
- One suggestion per comment — don't combine multiple fixes

## Line numbers

- Line numbers MUST refer to the **new version** of the file (right side of the diff)
- Only comment on lines that are **part of the diff** (added or modified lines)
- If you need to reference unchanged code for context, mention the file and function name instead of a line number

## Tone & wording

- **Start with a thank-you** — e.g. "Thanks for the contribution!" or "Thanks for tackling this!" to acknowledge the author's effort
- **Don't state the obvious** — never re-explain what the code does or how the fix works. The author already knows; the diff speaks for itself. Don't describe the implementation approach, the problem being solved, or how the pieces fit together. Never praise the implementation quality (e.g. "excellent implementation", "comprehensive and well-tested", "well-structured approach") — this is just parroting the PR description in different words
- **Keep approvals short** — if the PR looks good, a concise "LGTM 👍" with a brief thank-you is perfectly fine. No need for a full analysis, summary, or "Code Quality" section. Don't add sentences that describe or evaluate the PR's scope, approach, or quality
- **Skip code quality commentary** unless there are **severe** issues not caught by automated tooling (prettier, eslint, CI). Don't comment on formatting, naming style, or minor preferences
- **Don't duplicate information** — if you approve, don't include a "Summary", "Analysis", "Verification", or "Risk Assessment" section. Those repeat what the diff already shows. The summary should contain a thank-you and verdict. If you have multiple line comments, add one brief sentence summarizing the themes (e.g. "A few edge-case and error-handling suggestions below.") — but don't rehash each comment individually or describe what the PR does
- **Only post actionable line comments** — every inline comment must ask the author to do something or consider something specific (fix a bug, handle an edge case, rename something, add a test, etc.). Do NOT post comments that are just praise ("Good solution!", "Nice work here", "Excellent test coverage!"), observations ("This ensures consistency"), or narration of what the code does. If you have nothing actionable to say about a line, don't comment on it. An empty comments array is perfectly fine
- Be **constructive** — when you do leave feedback, suggest solutions, not just problems
- Phrase as questions when unsure: "Could this race if called concurrently?"
- Avoid subjective style debates unless they hurt readability
- Assume good intent — the author may have context you don't

## Follow-up reviews

When the PR already has prior reviews (including your own):

- **Read the conversation history** — check existing reviews and comments before writing yours
- If you previously requested changes and the author addressed them, **acknowledge that** and approve (or note remaining items) — don't write a fresh review from scratch
- **Follow the conversation naturally** — reference earlier feedback, e.g. "The issue I flagged earlier around X looks good now"
- Don't repeat feedback that was already addressed

## CI checks

Before submitting your review:

1. **Check CI status** — look at the check runs / status checks provided in the PR context
2. If checks are **failing**, investigate the failure logs and mention it in your review with guidance on how to fix
3. If checks are **passing**, no need to mention them

## Changesets

For monorepos or projects that use changesets:

1. **Verify a changeset was committed** — look for files in `.changeset/` in the diff
2. If a changeset is **missing** and the PR introduces user-facing changes, mention it in your review and guide the author:
   - "Looks like this PR is missing a changeset. You can add one by running `npx changeset` and committing the generated file."
3. If the PR is purely internal (CI, tests, docs), a changeset may not be required — use your judgment

## Monorepos (CRITICAL — scope all commands)

- Focus only on the packages changed in the diff
- **NEVER run unscoped build/lint/test/typecheck commands** — e.g. `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`. These operate on the entire monorepo, are extremely slow, and will likely OOM the sandbox
- **ALWAYS use `--filter`** to scope commands to the affected package(s):
  - `pnpm --filter @langchain/<pkg> build`
  - `pnpm --filter @langchain/<pkg> lint`
  - `pnpm --filter @langchain/<pkg> test`
- Determine the affected package from the file paths in the diff (e.g. `libs/providers/langchain-anthropic/` → `--filter @langchain/anthropic`). If unsure, check the `package.json` in that directory
- Don't install dependencies — they are already installed in the sandbox

## Review verdicts

| Verdict | When to use |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `approve` | No critical issues. Suggestions are optional. |
| `comment` | Feedback only — no blocking opinion. Use for first-pass reviews or when you lack context. |
| `request_changes` | Critical issues that must be addressed before merge. |

When in doubt, prefer `comment` over `request_changes`.
