# WPF Application Publishing Guide

When publishing WPF applications, ask the user about deployment and installer preferences.

---

## Ask User: Deployment Method

> **Which deployment method do you need?**
> 1. **Framework-Dependent** - Small size (~1MB), requires .NET runtime
> 2. **Self-Contained** - Includes runtime (150-200MB), no dependencies
> 3. **Single-File** - One executable (50-80MB compressed)

---

## Ask User: Installer Technology

> **Which installer/update technology do you prefer?**
> 1. **Velopack** (Recommended) - Modern, fast updates, delta updates
> 2. **MSIX** - Windows Store, enterprise deployment
> 3. **NSIS** - Traditional installer, full control
> 4. **Inno Setup** - Simple, widely used
> 5. **None** - Portable/xcopy deployment

## WPF Limitations

⚠️ **PublishTrimmed**: Not supported (reflection-heavy)
⚠️ **PublishAot**: Not supported (WPF incompatible)

---

## Basic Commands

```bash
# Framework-Dependent
dotnet publish -c Release

# Self-Contained
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true

# Single-File (WPF)
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true \
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true \
  -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
```
