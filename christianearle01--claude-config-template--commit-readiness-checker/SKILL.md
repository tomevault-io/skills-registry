# Commit Readiness Checker Skill

## Purpose & Activation

**What it does:** Validates all release prerequisites are met before committing, eliminating pre-commit anxiety and preventing incomplete releases.

**When it activates automatically:**
- "Am I ready to commit?"
- "Can I commit now?"
- "What's missing before commit?"
- "Check if ready for commit"
- "Validate release readiness"
- "Is everything done for the release?"

**How it helps:**
- Eliminates pre-commit anxiety ("Did I forget something?")
- Validates all release checklist items
- Prevents incomplete commits
- Drafts commit messages automatically
- Suggests next steps

**JIT Help Available:**
For quick reference on pre-commit workflow and troubleshooting, see: **[Cheat Sheet](./cheatsheet.md)**
- 5 most common validation queries (90% usage)
- Pre-commit workflow (6 steps, 5 minutes)
- Common blocker patterns with fix commands
- Commit message template
- Quick decision tree
- Semantic versioning guide

### Operation 4: Git Status Interpretation

**User Query:**
> "Check git status before commit"

**Confidence:** 🟢 High (0.92)
- Git status parsing is deterministic
- Clear categorization (staged/unstaged/untracked)
- Identifies accidental modifications

**Skill Response:**
```
Git Status Analysis:

Modified files (staged):
✅ version.json (3.3.0 → 3.4.0)
✅ CHANGELOG.md (v3.4.0 entry added)
✅ CLAUDE.md (version synced)
✅ README.md (version synced)
✅ SETUP_CONTEXT.md (version synced)

New files (staged):
✅ .claude/skills/version-management/SKILL.md
✅ .claude/skills/commit-readiness-checker/SKILL.md
✅ docs/00-start-here/12_learning-stages.md
[... 10 more files]

Untracked files:
(none - all clean!)

Status: ✅ Safe to commit

All changes are intentional and staged.
No accidental modifications detected.
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Untracked files = forgotten features (incomplete release)
- Unstaged files = partial commit (broken state)
- Status interpretation prevents accidental inclusions/exclusions
- **Quick win:** All staged = ready to commit safely

**Next Step:** Proceed with commit, or ask "Am I ready to commit?" for full validation

---

### Operation 5: Pre-Commit Validation (Detailed)

**User Query:**
> "Validate everything before commit"

**Confidence:** 🟢 High (0.96)
- Most comprehensive validation (6 categories)
- All checks deterministic (no ambiguity)
- 100% confidence when all pass

**Skill Response:**
```

## Integration with Release Workflow

### Typical Commit Flow

**Before Commit:**
```
1. Make all changes (version bump, CHANGELOG, new features)
2. Run sync-version.sh
3. Ask skill: "Am I ready to commit?"
4. Fix any blockers identified
5. Ask skill: "Draft commit message"
6. Review message
7. Commit
```

**Usage Pattern:**
```
User: Completes feature work
User: Updates version.json
User: Runs sync-version.sh
User: "Am I ready to commit?"
Skill: Validates all criteria
Skill: Drafts commit message
User: Reviews and commits
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Iterative Validation

**User:** (After fixing CHANGELOG)
"Am I ready to commit now?"

**Skill:**
```
Re-checking readiness...

Critical Checks:
✅ Version bumped (was already done)
✅ CHANGELOG updated (just fixed! ✓)
✅ Files synced (was already done)
✅ Git status clean (CHANGELOG now staged)

All blockers resolved! ✨

Status: READY TO COMMIT

[Provides commit message]
```

---

### Pattern 2: First-Time Release Check

**User:** "What do I need before first commit?"

**Skill:**
```
First Release Checklist:

Not Started:
❌ Update version.json
❌ Run sync-version.sh
❌ Update CHANGELOG.md
❌ Stage all files (git add .)

Follow this order:
1. Update version.json (version, release_date, release_name)
2. Run: ./scripts/sync-version.sh
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with new entry
4. Stage: git add .
5. Ask me: "Am I ready to commit?"

Start with step 1!
```

---

### Pattern 3: Post-Sync Validation

**User:** "I ran sync-version.sh, what now?"

**Skill:**
```
Post-Sync Status:

✅ Completed:
- version.json updated
- Files synced (verified 7 locations)

❌ Remaining:
- CHANGELOG.md (needs v3.4.0 entry)
- Git staging (need to: git add .)

Progress: 50% complete

Next immediate step:
Update CHANGELOG.md with v3.4.0 entry

Then: git add .
Then: Ask "Am I ready to commit?"
```

## Token Efficiency Analysis

⚠️ **These are PROJECTIONS based on testing, not multi-user validation.**

### Without Skill (Current - 900 tokens per query)

**Process:**
1. User: "Am I ready to commit?" (50 tokens)
2. Claude: "Let me check several things..." (100 tokens)
3. Read version.json (100 tokens)
4. Read CHANGELOG.md (200 tokens)
5. Check git status (100 tokens)
6. Check multiple files for sync (200 tokens)
7. Format response and draft message (150 tokens)

**Total: ~900 tokens**

### With Skill (Proposed - 300 tokens per query)

**Process:**
1. User: "Am I ready to commit?" (50 tokens)
2. Skill activates (50 tokens)
3. Run checklist validation (150 tokens)
4. Formatted response (50 tokens)

**Total: ~300 tokens**

**Savings: 600 tokens per query (67% reduction)**

### Frequency Impact

**Per Release (2 per week):**
- Pre-commit check: 1 query
- Fix and re-check: 1 query
- Draft commit message: 1 query
- **Total: 3 queries × 600 tokens = 1,800 tokens saved per release**

**Monthly (8 releases):**
- 8 releases × 1,800 tokens = 14,400 tokens saved
- **Cost savings: ~$0.43/month** (at Claude pricing)

**Quarterly:**
- 24 releases × 1,800 tokens = 43,200 tokens saved
- **Cost savings: ~$1.30/quarter**

**ROI:** Pays for implementation cost (~500 tokens) after 1 release.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: False Positive (Says ready but commit fails)

**Symptom:** Skill says "ready" but git commit fails

**Cause:** Git hooks, pre-commit scripts, or file permissions

**Solution:**
```
Skill checks standard criteria but cannot predict:
- Git hooks (pre-commit, commit-msg)
- File permission issues
- Git configuration problems

If commit fails after skill approval:
1. Check git hook output
2. Fix specific issue
3. Re-run commit
```

---

### Issue: CHANGELOG Detection Fails

**Symptom:** Skill says CHANGELOG missing entry, but it exists

**Cause:** Format mismatch or unexpected structure

**Solution:**
```
CHANGELOG must have exact format:
## [3.4.0] - 2025-12-13

Check:
- Square brackets around version
- Dash separator
- YYYY-MM-DD date format
- Spacing matches pattern

Correct any format issues.
```

---

### Issue: Git Status Shows Unexpected Files

**Symptom:** Skill reports untracked/modified files user didn't create

**Cause:** Auto-generated files, IDE configs, OS files

**Solution:**
```
Common culprits:
- .DS_Store (macOS)
- .vscode/ (VS Code)
- node_modules/ (npm)
- __pycache__/ (Python)

Check .gitignore includes these patterns.
If needed, update .gitignore before committing.
```
