# Pre-Project Planning Assistant Skill

**Purpose:** Guide users through structured pre-project planning to reduce rework, make informed architectural decisions, and set up projects for success from day one.

**For:** Developers planning new projects who need systematic guidance before writing code.

---

## When This Skill Auto-Activates

This skill automatically activates when you ask:
- "Help me plan a new project"
- "What should I consider before starting [project type]?"
- "Create a project plan for [idea]"
- "I'm starting a new [app/website/API/service]"
- "How do I plan a [type] project?"
- "What tech stack should I use for [requirements]?"
- "Help me architect [project description]"
- "Where do I begin with [project idea]?"

---

## What This Skill Does

### 1. Structured Planning Guidance

Guides you through **4 planning phases** systematically:

**Phase 1: Concept Clarification**
- What problem are you solving?
- Who are the target users?
- What are the core features vs nice-to-haves?
- What's the success criteria?

**Phase 2: Architecture Design**
- What's the high-level architecture? (monolith, microservices, serverless, etc.)
- What are the major components?
- How do components interact?
- What are the data flows?

**Phase 3: Tech Stack Selection**
- What constraints exist? (team skills, budget, timeline, hosting)
- What technologies fit the requirements?
- Why choose these over alternatives?
- What are the trade-offs?

**Phase 4: Timeline & Milestones**
- What's the MVP (minimum viable product)?
- What are the development phases?
- What are realistic timelines?
- What are the dependencies?

### 2. References Planning Documentation

Points you to the comprehensive planning guide:
- `03_pre-project-planning/01_must-have/01_planning-guide.md` (detailed methodology)
- `templates/project-plan-template.md` (structured template)

### 3. Coordinates with project-planner Agent

For **complex decisions** requiring deep multi-perspective analysis:
- Suggests when to use `@project-planner` agent
- Explains how agent provides 6-perspective coordinated analysis
- Helps you get maximum value from agent invocation

**Pattern:**
```
Skill (quick guidance) → Agent (deep analysis)

Simple projects: Skill handles everything
Complex projects: Skill guides → Agent analyzes → Skill synthesizes
```

### 4. Prevents Common Mistakes

Proactively warns about anti-patterns:
- **Premature optimization** - Don't architect for scale you don't need
- **Tech stack overload** - Don't use 10 technologies when 3 will do
- **Unclear requirements** - Don't start coding without user stories
- **No MVP defined** - Don't build everything at once
- **Ignoring constraints** - Don't ignore team skills, budget, timeline

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Simple Web App

**User Query:**
> "Help me plan a task management web app"

**Confidence:** 🟢 High (0.90)
- Clear project type (web app, task management)
- Standard architectural patterns exist
- Well-understood problem domain

**Skill Response:**
```
I'll guide you through planning your task management web app.

Phase 1: Concept Clarification
Let me ask a few questions to understand your vision:

1. Who are your target users?
   - Personal use, teams, enterprises?
   - Technical background of users?

2. What are the 3 core features users must have?
   - Task creation/editing?
   - Collaboration features?
   - Notifications/reminders?

3. What's your success criteria?
   - Number of users?
   - User retention?
   - Revenue goals?

Once you answer these, I'll help with architecture and tech stack decisions.

Resources:
- Detailed planning guide: 03_pre-project-planning/01_must-have/01_planning-guide.md
- Project plan template: templates/project-plan-template.md
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Clarifying questions prevent building wrong product (most common failure mode)
- Target user identification drives all tech decisions (personal → simple, enterprise → complex)
- Core features vs nice-to-haves prevent scope creep and endless development
- **Quick win:** Answer 3 questions now, get concrete architecture recommendations in < 5 min

**Next Step:** After answering, I'll suggest tech stack based on your constraints

### Example 2: Complex System Requiring Agent

**User Query:**
> "I'm building a real-time multiplayer game with chat, matchmaking, and leaderboards"

**Confidence:** 🟡 Medium (0.65)
- High complexity project (multiple subsystems)
- Architectural decisions require trade-off analysis
- Agent invocation recommended for depth

**Skill Response:**
```
This is a complex project with several architectural decisions. I recommend
using the @project-planner agent for deep multi-perspective analysis.

Why use the agent for this project?
- Multiple technologies needed (WebSockets, game servers, databases)
- Performance critical (real-time requirements)
- Complex state synchronization
- Multiple architectural approaches possible

I can help you prepare questions for the agent:

1. What's your experience level with real-time systems?
2. What's your budget for hosting?
3. How many concurrent users do you expect?
4. What platforms? (web, mobile, desktop)

With this context, the @project-planner agent can provide:
- 🧠 Psychological: User engagement patterns for game retention
- 📚 Educator: Learning path for technologies you'll need
- 💻 Engineering: Architecture recommendations (peer-to-peer vs server-authoritative)
- 🎨 UX Designer: Matchmaking flow and chat UX patterns
- 🔒 Security: Cheat prevention and data validation strategies
- 💰 Business: Cost analysis for different hosting approaches

Should I prepare a detailed prompt for the @project-planner agent?
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Complex projects = high failure risk without proper planning (60-70% fail)
- Agent provides 6-perspective analysis → Catches blind spots you'd miss alone
- Preparing context questions maximizes agent value (focused analysis vs generic advice)
- **Quick win:** Answer 4 prep questions, then agent delivers comprehensive plan

**Next Step:** After agent analysis, I'll help synthesize recommendations into actionable plan

### Example 3: Tech Stack Decision

**User Query:**
> "What tech stack should I use for a REST API with authentication?"

**Confidence:** 🟢 High (0.82)
- Focused tech decision (REST API + auth)
- 3 common patterns with clear trade-offs
- Constraint-based recommendation possible

**Skill Response:**
```
Let me help you choose a tech stack by understanding your constraints:

Questions to narrow down options:
1. What's your current expertise? (Python, Node.js, Go, etc.)
2. What's your deployment target? (AWS, Vercel, self-hosted)
3. How many requests per second do you expect?
4. Do you have database preferences?

Common patterns for REST API + Auth:

Option 1: Node.js + Express + JWT + PostgreSQL
- ✅ Large ecosystem, good for teams familiar with JavaScript
- ✅ Fast development with npm packages
- ❌ Not ideal for CPU-intensive tasks
- Best for: Quick MVP, JavaScript teams

Option 2: Python + FastAPI + JWT + PostgreSQL
- ✅ Excellent for data-heavy APIs
- ✅ Strong typing with Pydantic
- ❌ Slower than Go for high concurrency
- Best for: Data processing, ML integration

Option 3: Go + Gin + JWT + PostgreSQL
- ✅ Excellent performance and concurrency
- ✅ Simple deployment (single binary)
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem than Node/Python
- Best for: High-performance, microservices

Based on your answers, I can recommend the best fit.

Deep dive: See 03_pre-project-planning/01_must-have/01_planning-guide.md
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Wrong tech stack = months of pain (migration is expensive)
- Constraint-based selection prevents "shiny technology syndrome"
- Trade-off transparency helps make informed choices (not hype-driven)
- **Quick win:** Answer 4 questions, get tailored recommendation in < 2 min

**Next Step:** After choosing stack, ask "What's the MVP for this API?"

## FAQ

**Q: Should I always fill out the project-plan-template.md?**

A: For solo projects, you can skip it if the plan is clear in your head. For team projects or future reference, documenting is valuable. The template takes 20-30 minutes but saves hours of alignment later.

**Q: How detailed should my plan be before coding?**

A: Enough to answer: (1) What problem am I solving? (2) Who's the user? (3) What's the MVP? (4) What tech am I using and why? Don't over-plan - you'll learn more by building.

**Q: What if my project changes after I start?**

A: Normal! Plans are guides, not contracts. Update your project plan when direction shifts significantly. The planning process teaches you what questions to ask, even if answers change.

**Q: Should I use the @project-planner agent for every project?**

A: No. Simple projects (CRUD apps, static sites, scripts) don't need deep analysis. Use the agent when complexity is high, stakes are significant, or you're uncertain about approach.

**Q: Can this skill help me learn new technologies?**

A: Yes! When choosing tech, I can suggest learning paths and resources. But for systematic learning guidance, the planning-guide.md has detailed methodology.
