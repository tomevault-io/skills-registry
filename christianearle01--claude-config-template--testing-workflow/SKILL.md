# Testing Workflow Skill

## Purpose & Activation

This skill provides **automatic insights on test execution status** without requiring users to parse test output manually.

### When This Skill Activates

The skill automatically activates when users mention:
- Test results ("What tests failed?")
- Test status ("Show me test coverage")
- Test failures ("Which tests are broken?")
- Test performance ("What tests are slowest?")
- Test modules ("Show auth module tests")

### What This Skill Does

**READ-ONLY Operations:**
- Reads test result files (JSON, XML, logs)
- Identifies failed/passed tests
- Calculates statistics (pass rate, duration)
- Filters by module/suite
- Identifies slow tests
- Tracks recently fixed tests

**Complements Test Runners:**
- For WRITE operations (run tests), skill recommends test commands
- Works with any test framework (Jest, pytest, RSpec, etc.)
- Provides intelligence layer, test runner provides execution

**JIT Help Available:**
For quick reference on test commands and troubleshooting, see: **[Cheat Sheet](./cheatsheet.md)**
- 5 most common test queries (90% usage)
- Speed commands for Jest/pytest/RSpec
- Quick decision tree
- Common scenarios (CI failures, slow tests, refactoring)
- Pass rate and duration benchmarks
- Performance optimization guide

## Core Knowledge

### Supported Test Result Formats

**Jest (JavaScript/TypeScript):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "numTotalTests": 145,
  "numPassedTests": 142,
  "numFailedTests": 3,
  "testResults": [
    {
      "name": "auth/login.test.js",
      "status": "failed",
      "duration": 2300,
      "message": "Expected 401, got 500"
    }
  ]
}
```

**pytest (Python):**
```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "nodeid": "tests/test_auth.py::test_login_invalid",
      "outcome": "failed",
      "duration": 1.23,
      "longrepr": "AssertionError: expected 401, got 500"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "passed": 142,
    "failed": 3,
    "total": 145
  }
}
```

**RSpec (Ruby):**
```json
{
  "examples": [
    {
      "description": "handles invalid credentials",
      "file_path": "./spec/auth/login_spec.rb",
      "line_number": 45,
      "status": "failed",
      "run_time": 0.023,
      "exception": {
        "message": "expected 401, got 500"
      }
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "example_count": 145,
    "failure_count": 3
  }
}
```

### Status Values

- **passed** - Test executed successfully
- **failed** - Test failed with assertion error
- **skipped** - Test was skipped/pending
- **error** - Test had runtime error (not assertion)

---

## Key Operations

### 1. List Failed Tests

**User Queries:**
> "What tests failed?"
> "Show me failing tests"
> "Which tests are broken?"

**Confidence:** 🟢 High (0.92)
- Exact keyword matches: "failed", "failing", "broken"
- Test result files accessible (JSON/XML/logs)
- Clear intent to identify specific failures

**Skill Response:**
```
3 tests failed:

❌ auth/login.test.js - 'handles invalid credentials' (2.3s)
   Module: authentication
   Error: Expected 401, got 500
   File: src/auth/login.test.js:45

❌ auth/signup.test.js - 'validates email format' (1.8s)
   Module: authentication
   Error: Validation not triggered
   File: src/auth/signup.test.js:78

❌ payments/checkout.test.js - 'processes refund' (0.5s)
   Module: payments
   Error: Stripe API timeout
   File: src/payments/checkout.test.js:120

To fix, check the error messages and file locations above.
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Failed tests block deployment and indicate broken functionality
- File locations and line numbers speed up debugging (no hunting)
- Error messages reveal root cause patterns (2 auth tests = likely auth service issue)
- **Quick win:** Fix auth/login.test.js first (2.3s duration suggests integration issue)

**Next Step:** Want to see test stats to understand overall health? Ask "Give me test stats"

---

### 2. Test Statistics Dashboard

**User Queries:**
> "Give me test stats"
> "Test summary"
> "How many tests passed?"

**Confidence:** 🟢 High (0.94)
- Exact keyword matches: "stats", "summary", "passed"
- Test result aggregation is deterministic (JSON parsing)
- Clear intent for high-level overview

**Skill Response:**
```
📊 Test Execution Summary:

Total Tests: 145
✅ Passed: 142 (97.9%)
❌ Failed: 3 (2.1%)
⏭️ Skipped: 0 (0%)

By Module:
- authentication: 45 tests (3 failed)
- payments: 30 tests (0 failed)
- user-profile: 25 tests (0 failed)
- api-routes: 45 tests (0 failed)

Total Duration: 42.3s
Average: 0.29s per test
```

**Why This Matters:**
- 97.9% pass rate = generally healthy codebase (industry standard: >95%)
- Module breakdown reveals authentication as problem area (3 failures localized)
- Total duration 42.3s is reasonable for 145 tests (fast feedback loop)
- **Quick win:** All failures in one module = likely single root cause to fix

**Next Step:** Drill into authentication failures with "Show auth module tests"

---

### 3. Filter by Module

**User Queries:**
> "Show auth module tests"
> "What tests failed in payments?"
> "Authentication test results"

**Confidence:** 🟢 High (0.91)
- Module name explicitly mentioned ("auth", "payments")
- Test organization by module is standard practice
- Clear filtering intent

**Skill Response:**
```
Authentication Module Tests:

Total: 45 tests
✅ Passed: 42 (93.3%)
❌ Failed: 3 (6.7%)

Failed Tests:
1. login.test.js - 'handles invalid credentials'
2. signup.test.js - 'validates email format'
3. token.test.js - 'refreshes expired tokens'

Duration: 8.5s (average: 0.19s)

To run only auth tests:
  npm test -- auth
  # or
  pytest tests/auth/
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Module filtering isolates failures (93.3% pass rate within auth vs 97.9% overall)
- Focused view reveals related test failures (3 auth tests = likely 1 root cause)
- Faster iteration cycle (8.5s to run auth module vs 42.3s for all tests)
- **Quick win:** Run `npm test -- auth` to verify fixes without waiting for full suite

**Next Step:** After fixing auth tests, ask "What tests are newly passing?" to confirm success

---

### 4. Identify Slow Tests

**User Queries:**
> "What tests are slowest?"
> "Show me slow tests"
> "Which tests take longest?"

**Confidence:** 🟢 High (0.88)
- Exact keyword matches: "slowest", "slow", "longest"
- Duration data available in test results
- Clear performance optimization intent

**Skill Response:**
```
🐌 Slowest Tests (>1s):

1. integration/api-e2e.test.js (5.2s)
   Status: ✅ Passed
   Module: integration
   Consider: Mocking external API calls

2. auth/login.test.js (2.3s)
   Status: ❌ Failed
   Module: authentication
   Consider: Database setup might be slow

3. payments/checkout.test.js (1.8s)
   Status: ✅ Passed
   Module: payments
   Consider: Mocking Stripe API

Average test duration: 0.29s
Target: <0.5s per test
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Slow tests block fast iteration (3 tests account for 21% of total test time)
- External API calls are optimization targets (5.2s + 1.8s = 7s wasted on Stripe/API mocks)
- Developer productivity loss: 42.3s wait → potentially 33s wait (22% faster)
- **Quick win:** Mock external services in integration/api-e2e.test.js to save 5.2s per run

**Next Step:** After optimization, re-run "What tests are slowest?" to verify improvements

---

### 5. Recently Fixed Tests

**User Queries:**
> "What tests are newly passing?"
> "Recently fixed tests"
> "Tests that were broken but work now"

**Confidence:** 🟢 High (0.89)
- Exact keyword matches: "newly passing", "recently fixed", "broken but work now"
- Requires comparing current and previous test results
- Clear intent to track progress

**Skill Response:**
```
✅ Recently Fixed Tests (3):

These tests failed last run but pass now:

1. user-profile/avatar.test.js - 'uploads image'
   Was: Failed (file size validation)
   Now: ✅ Passed
   Fixed: 2 hours ago

2. api-routes/posts.test.js - 'creates new post'
   Was: Failed (database constraint)
   Now: ✅ Passed
   Fixed: 1 hour ago

3. auth/password-reset.test.js - 'sends email'
   Was: Failed (email service timeout)
   Now: ✅ Passed
   Fixed: 30 minutes ago

Great progress! Keep it up!
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Progress tracking motivates continued testing work (positive reinforcement)
- Recently fixed tests reveal which bug fixes are working (validation of recent code changes)
- Time stamps show velocity (3 fixes in 2 hours = good debugging pace)
- **Quick win:** 3 tests fixed means 3 fewer failures to worry about - celebrate this!

**Next Step:** Run full test suite again to confirm no regressions: "Give me test stats"

## Integration with Test Runners

### When to Use Skill vs Test Commands

**Use Skill (This) For:**
- Quick status checks
- Filtering and searching
- Test discovery
- Statistics and insights
- Performance analysis

**Use Test Commands For:**
- Running tests
- Watching tests
- Generating coverage
- Debugging specific tests

### Test Runner Commands Reference

The skill recommends these commands when appropriate:

**Jest (JavaScript/TypeScript):**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific file
npm test -- auth/login.test.js

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run only failed tests
npm test -- --onlyFailures
```

**pytest (Python):**
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific module
pytest tests/auth/

# Run specific test
pytest tests/auth/test_login.py::test_invalid_credentials

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run only failed tests
pytest --lf
```

**RSpec (Ruby):**
```bash
# Run all tests
rspec

# Run specific file
rspec spec/auth/login_spec.rb

# Run specific test
rspec spec/auth/login_spec.rb:45

# Run only failed tests
rspec --only-failures
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Status Check

**User:** "How are my tests doing?"

**Skill:**
```
✅ Looking good! 142/145 tests passing (97.9%)

3 tests failed in the authentication module.
Want to see the failures?
```

---

### Example 2: Module-Specific Failure

**User:** "What failed in auth?"

**Skill:**
```
Authentication module has 3 failures:

❌ login.test.js - Invalid credentials (Expected 401, got 500)
❌ signup.test.js - Email validation not triggered
❌ token.test.js - Token refresh failed

All 3 seem related to API status codes. Check auth/routes.js:67
```

---

### Example 3: Performance Investigation

**User:** "Why are tests so slow?"

**Skill:**
```
Total test time: 42.3s (average: 0.29s per test)

🐌 3 tests taking >1s:
- integration/api-e2e.test.js (5.2s) - external API calls
- auth/login.test.js (2.3s) - database setup
- payments/checkout.test.js (1.8s) - Stripe API mock

Recommendation: Mock external services. This could save ~9s (21%)
```

---

### Example 4: Coverage Check

**User:** "What's our test coverage?"

**Skill:**
```
Test Coverage (from last run):

Lines: 87.3% (2,453 / 2,810)
Branches: 82.1% (445 / 542)
Functions: 91.2% (312 / 342)

Modules needing coverage:
- payments/refund.js: 45% (needs 15 more tests)
- auth/2fa.js: 62% (needs 8 more tests)
- api/webhooks.js: 71% (needs 5 more tests)

To generate updated coverage:
  npm test -- --coverage
```

### Savings Analysis

**Per Query:**
- Without skill: 800 tokens
- With skill: 300 tokens
- **Savings: 500 tokens (62% reduction)**

**Frequency Impact:**

For QA engineers checking test results ~10 times per day:

| Timeframe | Without Skill | With Skill | Savings |
|-----------|--------------|------------|---------|
| Daily (10 queries) | 8,000 tokens | 3,000 tokens | 5,000 (62%) |
| Weekly (50 queries) | 40,000 tokens | 15,000 tokens | 25,000 (62%) |
| Monthly (200 queries) | 160,000 tokens | 60,000 tokens | 100,000 (62%) |

**Cost Savings (at Anthropic pricing):**
- Daily: ~$0.15 saved
- Weekly: ~$0.75 saved
- Monthly: ~$3.00 saved per QA engineer

**ROI:** Implementation cost (~500 tokens) recovered in first day.

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep test results accessible** - Ensure test output is saved to JSON
2. **Use consistent naming** - Module/suite names help filtering
3. **Run tests regularly** - Skill needs recent data
4. **Check after failures** - Use skill to quickly understand what broke

### For Claude (Using This Skill)

1. **Auto-activate proactively** - When user mentions test failures
2. **Filter intelligently** - Show most critical failures first
3. **Provide context** - Don't just list failures, suggest fixes
4. **Link to commands** - Direct users to test runner for execution
5. **Be concise** - Status emoji + test name + error = enough

---

## Troubleshooting

### Test Results File Not Found

If test results don't exist:

```
Test results file not found.

To generate test results:
  Jest: npm test -- --json --outputFile=test-results.json
  pytest: pytest --json-report --json-report-file=test-results.json
  RSpec: rspec --format json --out test-results.json

Then I can provide insights on your test execution!
```

### Test Results Out of Date

If results are stale:

```
Test results are from 3 days ago.

To get current status:
  [appropriate test command for framework]

Then ask me again for up-to-date insights!
```
