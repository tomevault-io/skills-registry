Activates on preference statements ("I prefer", "I always", "I like"), corrections ("no, don't", "actually"), identity statements ("my name is", "I work at"), project decisions, or when the system detects memory-related context. Works invisibly in the background. Use when this capability is needed.

# Ensue Auto-Memory

Automatic persistent memory that works invisibly in the background. Memories are loaded at session start and saved automatically when you detect preferences, corrections, or significant decisions.

## How It Works

1. **Session Start**: Your identity, preferences, corrections, and project context are automatically loaded
2. **During Session**: When you detect saveable information, save it immediately
3. **Session End**: A final check saves any significant learnings not yet persisted

## Environment Requirements

- `ENSUE_API_KEY`: Your Ensue API key (get one at https://www.ensue-network.ai/dashboard)
- `ENSUE_USERNAME`: Your username for memory namespacing

## When to Save (Automatic Triggers)

Save immediately when you detect:

| Trigger | Category | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| "I prefer X", "I always X", "I like X" | preferences/ | "I prefer early returns" |
| "Don't do X", "Stop doing X", "No, actually Y" | corrections/ | "Don't add emojis" |
| "My name is X", "I work at Y", "I'm a Z" | identity/ | "I'm a senior engineer" |
| Architectural decision for current project | projects/{project}/ | "Using JWT for auth" |
| Workflow or tool preference | preferences/ | "Always use pnpm" |

## Key Structure

```
@{ENSUE_USERNAME}/{category}/{subcategory}

Categories:
- identity/       - name, role, company, timezone
- preferences/    - code style, tools, workflows
- corrections/    - things NOT to do (learned from user feedback)
- projects/{name}/ - project-specific context and decisions
```

## How to Save

Use curl to call the Ensue API. Always use:
- `embed: true` for semantic search
- `embed_source: "value"` to embed the verbose content

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.ensue-network.ai/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ENSUE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "create_memory",
      "arguments": {
        "items": [{
          "key_name": "@{username}/{category}/{subcategory}",
          "description": "Short label for this memory",
          "value": "Verbose, detailed content that captures the full context and meaning",
          "embed": true,
          "embed_source": "value"
        }]
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

## Memory Quality Guidelines

Memories should be:

- **Specific**: "Prefers early returns over nested conditionals" not "likes clean code"
- **Actionable**: Information that changes how you should behave
- **Standalone**: Understandable without session context
- **Non-limiting**: Inform decisions, don't constrain them rigidly

### Good Examples

```
Key: @christine/preferences/code-style
Value: Use early returns instead of nested if/else blocks. Keep functions under
50 lines. Prefer explicit types over inference in function signatures.

Key: @christine/corrections/no-over-engineering
Value: Don't add abstractions, helper functions, or configurability unless
explicitly needed. Keep solutions simple and direct. Don't refactor code
that wasn't asked to be refactored.

Key: @christine/projects/api-service/architecture
Value: REST API using Express.js with TypeScript. PostgreSQL database with
Prisma ORM. JWT authentication with refresh tokens. All endpoints require
authentication except /health and /auth/*.
```

### Bad Examples

- "User likes good code" (too vague)
- "Fixed the bug in line 42" (too session-specific)
- "User was frustrated" (emotional state, not actionable)

## Multi-User Awareness

The Ensue network contains memories from multiple users. Each user's memories are prefixed with their username.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Current user's memories start with: `@{ENSUE_USERNAME}/`
- Keys starting with OTHER usernames (e.g., `@alice/`, `@bob/`) are from different users
- **NEVER read, reference, or use memories belonging to other users**
- Always filter API results to only include keys starting with `@{ENSUE_USERNAME}/`

## Updating Existing Memories

When a preference or context changes, use `update_memory` to overwrite:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.ensue-network.ai/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ENSUE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "update_memory",
      "arguments": {
        "key_name": "@{username}/preferences/testing",
        "value": "Updated preference content...",
        "embed": true,
        "embed_source": "value"
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

## Discovering Relevant Memories

If you need additional context during a session, use `discover_memories`:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.ensue-network.ai/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ENSUE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "discover_memories",
      "arguments": {
        "query": "authentication preferences security",
        "limit": 5
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

This returns keys + relevance scores. Then fetch values for relevant keys (score > 0.7) using `get_memory`.

## Configuration

These environment variables can customize behavior:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ENSUE_USERNAME` | (required) | Your username for key prefixing |
| `ENSUE_API_KEY` | (required) | Your Ensue API key |
| `ENSUE_RELEVANCY_THRESHOLD` | 0.7 | Minimum score for discovered memories |
| `ENSUE_PROJECT_LIMIT` | 5 | Max project memories to load at start |
| `ENSUE_PREFERENCES_LIMIT` | 10 | Max preferences to load at start |
| `ENSUE_CORRECTIONS_LIMIT` | 5 | Max corrections to load at start |

## Security

- **NEVER** echo or print `$ENSUE_API_KEY`
- **NEVER** save credentials or secrets to Ensue
- **NEVER** include the API key in error messages or logs
