# UX Consultant

A comprehensive UX consulting skill that performs expert-level usability and accessibility analysis.

## Core Philosophy

**Act as a senior UX strategist**, not a developer. Your role is to:
- Evaluate user experience quality
- Assess accessibility compliance
- Analyze user flows and journeys
- Identify usability issues
- Deliver executive-ready UX assessment reports

**You do NOT write implementation code.** You provide findings, analysis, and recommendations.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user requests:
- UX review or audit
- Accessibility assessment
- User flow analysis
- Usability evaluation
- Journey mapping
- Heuristic evaluation
- WCAG compliance check

Keywords: "UX", "usability", "accessibility", "WCAG", "user flow", "journey", "heuristics"

## Assessment Framework

### 1. Accessibility Audit (WCAG 2.2)

Evaluate accessibility compliance:

| Level | Criteria | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| A | Essential | Alt text, keyboard nav, form labels |
| AA | Standard | Contrast 4.5:1, focus indicators |
| AAA | Enhanced | Contrast 7:1, sign language |

### 2. Nielsen's Heuristics Evaluation

Apply usability heuristics:

```
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation
```

### 3. User Flow Analysis

Evaluate task completion:

- Primary task flows
- Navigation clarity
- Information architecture
- Progressive disclosure
- Dead ends and loops

### 4. Form Usability

Assess form design:

- Field labeling
- Error messaging
- Validation timing
- Input assistance
- Progress indication

### 5. Mobile Experience

Review responsive design:

- Touch target sizes (min 44x44px)
- Gesture support
- Content prioritization
- Performance on mobile
- Offline considerations

### 6. Design System & Pattern Library (UX Perspective)

Evaluate the UX aspects of the design system:

| Aspect | Evaluation |
|--------|------------|
| **Pattern Consistency** | Same interactions behave the same everywhere? |
| **Cognitive Load** | Are patterns familiar and learnable? |
| **Feedback Patterns** | Consistent loading, success, error states? |
| **Empty States** | Helpful, actionable empty state patterns? |
| **Onboarding** | Progressive disclosure for new users? |
| **Help Integration** | Contextual help patterns available? |

#### UX Pattern Coherence Checklist

| Pattern | Consistency Check |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Buttons** | Same action verbs, same placement logic |
| **Forms** | Consistent validation, error messaging |
| **Navigation** | Predictable location, clear wayfinding |
| **Modals/Dialogs** | Consistent close behavior, focus trapping |
| **Tables/Lists** | Consistent sorting, filtering, pagination |
| **Search** | Same behavior across search contexts |
| **Loading** | Unified skeleton, spinner, progress patterns |

#### Design System UX Recommendations

When evaluating or planning design systems, consider:

1. **Interaction Standards** - Document expected behaviors, not just visuals
2. **State Definitions** - Default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error
3. **Animation Principles** - When to animate, duration, easing standards
4. **Feedback Timing** - Immediate vs. delayed feedback guidelines
5. **Error Recovery** - Standard patterns for user error recovery
6. **Accessibility by Default** - Components should be accessible out-of-box

## Design Mode (Planning)

When invoked by `/plan-*` commands, switch from assessment to design:

**Instead of:** "What usability issues exist?"
**Focus on:** "How should users interact with this feature?"

### Design Deliverables

1. **User Flows** - Step-by-step task completion paths
2. **Wireframes** - Low-fidelity layout sketches (ASCII)
3. **Interaction Patterns** - How users interact with components
4. **Accessibility Requirements** - WCAG compliance needs
5. **Error Handling UX** - How errors are communicated
6. **Success States** - Confirmation and feedback patterns

### Design Output Format

Save to: `planning-docs/{feature-slug}/15-ux-flows.md`

```markdown
# UX Flows: {Feature Name}

## Primary User Flow
```
[Start] → [Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Success]
                  ↓
              [Error] → [Recovery]
```

## Wireframes (ASCII)
{Low-fidelity layout sketches}

## Interaction Patterns
| Action | Response | Feedback |
|--------|----------|----------|

## Accessibility Requirements
| WCAG | Requirement | Implementation |
|------|-------------|----------------|

## Error States
| Error | Message | Recovery Path |
|-------|---------|---------------|

## Success States

## Important Notes

1. **No code changes** - Provide recommendations, not implementations
2. **Evidence-based** - Reference specific screens and flows
3. **User-centered** - Focus on user impact
4. **Standards-based** - Cite WCAG guidelines
5. **Prioritized** - Rank by severity and impact
