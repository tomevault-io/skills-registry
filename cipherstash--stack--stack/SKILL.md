description: Supply-chain security controls for the @cipherstash/stack monorepo. Covers post-install script policy (onlyBuiltDependencies), install cooldown (minimumReleaseAge), lockfile integrity (blockExoticSubdeps + lockfile registry check), frozen-lockfile CI, registry pinning (.npmrc), Dependabot cooldown, and CODEOWNERS. Use when modifying CI workflows, pnpm config, dependency updates, .github/dependabot.yml, or anything that touches how packages enter the build. Use when this capability is needed.

# Supply Chain Security

Controls applied in this repo to limit blast radius from compromised npm packages, lockfile injection, dependency confusion, and rushed dependency upgrades. Sourced from [lirantal/npm-security-best-practices](https://github.com/lirantal/npm-security-best-practices) and adapted for our pnpm workspace.

## When to Use This Skill

- Modifying any file under `.github/workflows/`
- Editing `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `package.json` `pnpm` block, or `.npmrc`
- Updating `.github/dependabot.yml` or `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- Adding a dependency that needs a build script (i.e. `node-gyp`, `node-pty`, prebuilt binaries)
- Bypassing the install cooldown for a security fix
- Reviewing a PR that touches any of the above

## What's Enforced (Config + Test Gate)

Each control below is validated by `e2e/tests/supply-chain.e2e.test.ts` — the test suite fails CI if a control regresses, so silent removal isn't possible.

### 1. Post-install scripts disabled by default — practice #1

pnpm 10+ disables lifecycle scripts globally and only runs them for packages on the `onlyBuiltDependencies` allowlist.

- **Where**: `package.json` `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`
- **Current allowlist**: `["node-pty"]` (PTY tests need the native module built)
- **Test asserts**: allowlist length ≤ 3 — adding a fourth entry forces explicit review

### 2. Install cooldown — practice #2

New package versions wait 7 days before they're eligible for install. Mirrors the Dependabot cooldown so manual + automated updates have the same community-discovery window.

- **Where**: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `minimumReleaseAge: 10080` (minutes)
- **Test asserts**: ≥ 4320 minutes (3 days)

### 3. Lockfile injection prevented — practices #4, #16

Two layers:

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `blockExoticSubdeps: true` — pnpm refuses to install transitive deps that come from git or direct tarballs (pnpm ≥ 10.26)
- A test parses `pnpm-lock.yaml` and asserts every resolved tarball URL starts with `https://registry.npmjs.org/`

(Why not `lockfile-lint`? It only supports npm/yarn lockfiles. The pnpm-native test gives us the same protection.)

### 4. Frozen lockfile in CI — practice #5

CI uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. If `pnpm-lock.yaml` and any `package.json` drift, the install aborts — no silent registry fetches that bypass the locked versions.

- **Where**: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
- **Test asserts**: every `pnpm install` invocation in tests.yml carries `--frozen-lockfile`

### 5. Cooldown'd auto-updates — practice #6

Dependabot opens grouped, cooldown'd PRs (7 days minor/patch, 14 days major) for both `npm` and `github-actions`. Major bumps stay un-grouped — one PR each, easier to review.

- **Where**: `.github/dependabot.yml`
- **Test asserts**: cooldown ≥ 3 days, both ecosystems present

### 6. Registry pinning — practice #16

`.npmrc` pins both the default registry and the `@cipherstash` scope to `https://registry.npmjs.org/`. Auth tokens stay in user-level `~/.npmrc` or env vars — never committed.

- **Test asserts**: `.npmrc` contains both pin lines and no `_authToken` / `NPM_TOKEN`

### 7. Governance (CODEOWNERS)

`.github/CODEOWNERS` requires `@cipherstash/developers` review for every supply-chain critical file. Combined with branch protection (configured in repo settings, not in this repo), this prevents single-actor changes to the chain.

- **Test asserts**: CODEOWNERS lists each critical path

## What's Documented but Not Enforced

These controls depend on developer environment or org-level configuration — we describe them here but don't gate CI on them.

### Harden installs locally — practice #3

For local installs of new packages, consider running them through one of:

- [`npq`](https://github.com/lirantal/npq) — security checks, package age, typosquatting, provenance: `npq install <pkg>`
- [Socket Firewall (`sfw`)](https://socket.dev) — real-time blocker for known-malicious packages: `sfw pnpm add <pkg>`

Neither is required, but they're cheap insurance when adding a new direct dependency.

### 2FA on npm accounts — practice #10

Every maintainer with publish access to `@cipherstash/*` should have:

```bash
npm profile enable-2fa auth-and-writes
```

(This becomes mostly moot once the deferred OIDC-trusted-publisher migration lands — the workflow won't need long-lived tokens at all. See "Deferred" below.)

### Reduce dependency tree — practice #13

Before adding a new direct dep, ask:

- Does Node ≥ 22 (our minimum) already provide this?
- Is the package actively maintained? Check Snyk's database (security.snyk.io) — practice #14
- What does `npm pack <pkg>` show in the actual tarball? (npmjs.org's web view can lie — practice #15)

### Secrets in CI

`tests.yml` writes `.env` files at CI time from GitHub Secrets. This is acceptable: secrets are never committed, scoped to the runner, and rotate via the GitHub UI. The `.env` files exist only for the lifetime of the job.

Do **not** commit any `.env` file to the repo.

## What's Deferred (Follow-Up PR)

These need npmjs.com-side configuration and are tracked separately:

- **Provenance attestations** — practice #11
- **OIDC trusted publishing** — practice #12

Both require the npm org admin to register each `@cipherstash/*` package as a Trusted Publisher (cipherstash/stack repo + release.yml). Once that's done, `release.yml` can drop `NPM_TOKEN` entirely, run `npm publish` with `id-token: write`, and provenance is auto-generated.

## Common Operations

### Add a dependency that needs a build script

1. Vet the package: latest version, active maintenance, reasonable download counts, source visible on GitHub.
2. Run `npm pack <pkg>` and inspect the tarball — confirm the install script is what you expect.
3. Add to `package.json` `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`:
   ```json
   "pnpm": {
     "onlyBuiltDependencies": ["node-pty", "your-new-package"]
   }
   ```
4. Update the supply-chain test's allowlist threshold if you'd be adding the 4th entry — and explain in the PR why the count needs to grow.
5. Run `pnpm install` to confirm the build script executes.

### Bypass the install cooldown for a security fix

When CVE response needs a patch faster than 7 days:

```bash
# pnpm flag for a one-off install:
pnpm install <pkg>@<version> --ignore-workspace-min-release-age
```

Document the bypass in the PR description (CVE ID, why the cooldown was the bottleneck) so the next reviewer can follow the reasoning.

### Add a new dev dependency

No special steps — Dependabot will pick it up on the next weekly run (after the cooldown window). For immediate use, just `pnpm add -D <pkg>`.

### Change a CI workflow

CODEOWNERS will request review from `@cipherstash/developers`. The supply-chain test will fail if the change drops `--frozen-lockfile` or downgrades Node.
