# Finish the Day - Universal End-of-Day Wrap Up

This skill performs a comprehensive end-of-day wrap up for the **current working directory**. It analyzes all work done, creates a detailed log, commits changes, and pushes to the remote repository. Works on any project.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Analyze Today's Work**
   - Reviews all commits made today
   - Identifies all modified, added, and deleted files
   - Calculates lines added/removed
   - Summarizes changes by category

2. **Create Daily Update Log**
   - Generates comprehensive markdown documentation
   - Organized by feature/area of work
   - Includes code snippets for key changes
   - Documents technical decisions and notes

3. **Commit All Changes**
   - Stages all uncommitted changes
   - Creates detailed commit message
   - Follows conventional commit format

4. **Push to Remote**
   - Pushes all commits to remote repository
   - Reports sync status

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather Information

Collect all data about today's work:

```bash
# Get today's date
date +%Y-%m-%d

# Get project name from current directory or package.json
basename $(pwd)

# Check git status for uncommitted changes
git status

# Get diff stats for uncommitted changes
git diff --stat

# Get today's commits (commits from today)
git log --since="midnight" --oneline

# Get detailed changes from today's commits
git log --since="midnight" --stat

# Get all files changed today (committed + uncommitted)
git diff --name-only HEAD~10 2>/dev/null || git diff --name-only

# Count lines changed
git diff --shortstat
```

### Step 2: Analyze Changes

For each changed file:
1. **Read the file** to understand what was implemented
2. **Categorize changes** by type:
   - New features
   - Bug fixes
   - Refactoring
   - Documentation
   - Configuration
   - Tests
3. **Identify key components** created or modified
4. **Note any breaking changes**

### Step 3: Determine Daily Updates Location

Check for existing daily updates folder:

```bash
# Common locations to check (in order of preference)
# 1. Daily-updates in parent directory (for monorepos)
# 2. docs/daily-updates in project
# 3. daily-updates in project root
# 4. Create in project root if none exist

ls -d ../Daily-updates 2>/dev/null || \
ls -d ./docs/daily-updates 2>/dev/null || \
ls -d ./daily-updates 2>/dev/null || \
echo "Will create ./daily-updates"
```

If no daily updates folder exists, ask the user where to create the log or create `./daily-updates/` in the project root.

### Step 4: Create Daily Update Log

Generate a markdown file with the following structure:

```markdown
# Daily Development Update - [DATE]

## Overview
[Brief summary of what was accomplished]

---

## 1. [Feature/Area Name]

### [Sub-feature]
- Description of changes
- Key implementation details
- Files affected

### Code Changes
[Relevant code snippets or interface definitions]

---

## 2. [Next Feature/Area]
...

---

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| path/to/file | Description |

## Files Created

| File | Lines | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| path/to/file | XXX | Description |

---

## Technical Notes
- Important decisions made
- Dependencies added
- Configuration changes

---

## Next Steps / Considerations
- Pending work
- Future improvements
- Issues to address
```

### Step 5: Commit Changes

Stage and commit all changes:

```bash
# Stage all changes including untracked files
git add -A

# Show what will be committed
git status

# Create commit with detailed message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[Type]: Brief description

Detailed changes:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

)"
```

### Step 6: Push to Remote

```bash
# Push all commits
git push

# Report final status
git log --oneline -3
```

## Daily Log Format Guidelines

### File Naming
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-update.md`
- Example: `2024-12-23-daily-update.md`

### Content Guidelines
1. **Be specific** - Include actual file names, function names, component names
2. **Show code** - Include interface definitions, key function signatures
3. **Document decisions** - Note why certain approaches were chosen
4. **List next steps** - Help future-you know where to continue

### Categories to Consider
- **UI/UX Changes** - Visual updates, layout changes, styling
- **New Features** - New functionality added
- **Bug Fixes** - Issues resolved
- **Refactoring** - Code improvements without functionality changes
- **API Changes** - Backend, endpoints, data structures
- **Configuration** - Build, deployment, environment changes
- **Documentation** - README, comments, docs
- **Tests** - New or updated tests
- **Dependencies** - Added, removed, or updated packages

## Tool Usage

This skill uses:
- `Bash` - For git operations and file system checks
- `Glob` - To find changed files by pattern
- `Read` - To read file contents for analysis
- `Write` - To create the daily update log
- `Task` with `Explore` agent - For deep analysis if needed

## Important Notes

- **Works on current directory** - No hardcoded paths
- **Adapts to any project** - Detects project structure automatically
- **Preserves existing logs** - Adds new log, doesn't overwrite
- **Safe git operations** - Never force pushes or destructive operations
- **Asks before creating folders** - Confirms daily-updates location with user

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when user says:
- "finish the day"
- "end of day"
- "wrap up"
- "wrap up the day"
- "daily wrap up"
- "create daily update"
- "commit and push everything"
- "end session"

## Example Output

After running this skill, you'll have:

1. **Daily update log** at `[project]/daily-updates/YYYY-MM-DD-daily-update.md`
2. **Git commit** with detailed message summarizing all changes
3. **Pushed to remote** - All work synced to remote repository
4. **Summary report** showing:
   - Files changed (X modified, Y created, Z deleted)
   - Lines changed (+XXX, -YYY)
   - Commits pushed (X commits)
   - Daily log location
