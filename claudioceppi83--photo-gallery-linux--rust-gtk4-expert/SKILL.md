# Rust GTK4 Expert

This skill provides expert patterns and practices for building high-quality Linux desktop applications using Rust, GTK4, and Libadwaita.

## Core Architecture Patterns

### 1. The Factory Pattern for Components
Avoid monolithic `main.rs` files. Split UI components into separate files using the Factory pattern or GObject subclassing.

**Preferred Approach (Function-based Components - Simpler):**
Create functions that return widgets or tuples of widgets/controllers.

```rust
// src/components/header_bar.rs
use gtk4::prelude::*;
use libadwaita as adw;

pub fn create_header_bar() -> adw::HeaderBar {
    let header_bar = adw::HeaderBar::new();
    // Configure header bar...
    header_bar
}
```

**Advanced Approach (GObject Subclassing - More Powerful):**
Use `glib::subclass` when you need custom signals, properties, or complex internal state.

### 2. State Management
Use `Rc<RefCell<AppState>>` for shared mutable state in simple apps. For complex apps, consider the "Model-View-Update" (MVU) pattern (like Relm4) or a centralized `AppModel` using GObject properties.

**Standard Pattern:**
```rust
struct AppState {
    counter: i32,
}

let state = Rc::new(RefCell::new(AppState { counter: 0 }));

button.connect_clicked(glib::clone!(@strong state => move |_| {
    let mut s = state.borrow_mut();
    s.counter += 1;
    println!("Counter: {}", s.counter);
}));
```

### 3. Async UI and Concurrency
**NEVER block the main thread.**
Use `glib::MainContext::default().spawn_local()` for async operations that interact with the UI.
Use `std::thread` for CPU-bound tasks, communicating results back to the main thread via `glib::Sender` or `async_channel` integration.

## UI Design Guidelines (Libadwaita)

- **Adaptive Design:** Use `adw::Clamp`, `adw::Leaflet`, or `adw::OverlaySplitView` to support mobile and desktop layouts.
- **Modern Widgets:** Prefer `adw::StatusPage` for empty states, `adw::PreferencesWindow` for settings.
- **Styling:** Use CSS classes (`.title-1`, `.accent`, `.success`) instead of hardcoded styles.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Memory Leaks:** Watch out for reference cycles with `Rc`. Use `glib::clone!` with `@weak` references for closures connected to widgets that outlive the closure.
- **Incorrect Threading:** GTK widgets are **not click-safe** (except where noted). Always manipulate UI widgets from the main thread.

## Testing
- Unit test logic that is decoupled from widgets.
- For UI testing, use accessibility APIs or dedicated testing tools like `dogtail` (external) or `gtk4::test`.
