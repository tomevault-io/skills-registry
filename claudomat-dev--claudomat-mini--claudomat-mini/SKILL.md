You are the `/update-tools` skill. Your job is to verify that this machine has
every external dependency the auto-claude brain expects, and — with the user's
per-item consent — install anything missing.

## Always ask before fixing

The user's policy is **always ask per item** before applying any fix. You MUST
NOT silently install, copy, modify shell config, or change `~/.claude.json`.
Even for "safe" operations like copying an agent markdown file into
`~/.claude/agents/`, ask first. A `--yes` batch flag does not exist — respect
the policy.

For high-friction items (MCP configs, auth flows, shell config edits), do NOT
apply fixes at all. Print copy-pasteable instructions and let the user
apply them manually.

## Step 1 — Locate install.md

Try these paths in order. Stop at the first hit:

1. `$PWD/command-center/setup-tools/install.md`
2. Walk up from `$PWD` looking for `.brainignore` (project-root marker). If found,
   check `<project-root>/command-center/setup-tools/install.md`.
3. Walk up from `$PWD` looking for a `.git` directory that contains a
   `command-center/setup-tools/install.md` (auto-claude repo itself, where
   the brain author runs this skill).
4. Fall back to the auto-claude cache: if
   `~/.cache/auto-claude/source.git` exists, use
   `git --git-dir=~/.cache/auto-claude/source.git show HEAD:command-center/setup-tools/install.md`.

If no install.md is found, abort with:
> Cannot locate install.md. Run this skill from inside an auto-claude consumer
> project, from the auto-claude repo itself, or after `auto-claude init` has
> populated `~/.cache/auto-claude/source.git`.

Read the located install.md in full before proceeding.

## Step 2 — Enumerate expected items

Walk every section of install.md and build an inventory of verifiable items.
The source of truth is install.md itself; if a section is added or removed
upstream, the skill adapts on next invocation.

Categorize each expected item into one of three risk tiers:

### Low-risk (prompt, then auto-fix if approved)

- **Missing agent file** under `~/.claude/agents/<name>.md`.
  Fix: `cp` from a known cache (e.g. `~/.cache/voltagent/`, `~/.cache/gstack/`,
  `~/.cache/darcyegb-agents/`) to `~/.claude/agents/`. If no cache exists yet,
  surface the git clone command from the relevant install.md section and
  prompt before running.
- **Missing skill file** under `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
  Fix: `cp -r` from the source cache to `~/.claude/skills/`, or `ln -s` if
  the source is in a persistent location.

### Medium-risk (prompt with exact command, run if approved)

- **Missing global CLI** (not found on `$PATH`).
  Fix: run the install command from install.md (e.g. `npm install -g task-master-ai`,
  `bash <(curl -fsSL cli.new)` for Railway). Show the exact command in the
  prompt so the user knows what will execute.
- **Missing Claude Code plugin.** Surface the marketplace-add + install
  command. Prompt before running — plugin installs prompt for marketplace
  acceptance on first install and may require a Claude Code restart.

### High-friction (do NOT auto-fix; print instructions)

- **Missing MCP server** in `~/.claude.json` or `~/.mcp.json`.
  Do NOT edit the file yourself. Print the exact JSON fragment from
  install.md § 5 (matched to the specific MCP), formatted for copy-paste:
  ```
  Paste this into ~/.mcp.json under the "mcpServers" key:
  {
    "aidesigner": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.aidesigner.ai/api/v1/mcp"
    }
  }
  Then restart Claude Code.
  ```
- **Missing authentication** (gh auth, Railway login, aidesigner browser SSO,
  Dynadot API key). Print the exact command the user needs to run
  (`gh auth login`, `railway login`, etc.) and the link to the relevant
  install.md section.
- **Missing shell configuration** (rtk PreToolUse hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`,
  SSH keep-alive, tmux plugins). Print the config fragment and target path.
  Explicitly do not write to these files.

## Step 3 — Run verification checks

For each expected item, run the appropriate check:

| Item type | Check |
|---|---|
| Global CLI | `which <cmd>` → exit 0 = present |
| Agent file | `[[ -f ~/.claude/agents/<name>.md ]]` |
| Skill directory | `[[ -d ~/.claude/skills/<name> ]]` with a SKILL.md inside |
| Plugin | Check `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` for the plugin name |
| MCP server | Look in `~/.mcp.json` top-level `mcpServers` + `~/.claude.json` per-project `mcpServers`. Match by name. |
| Shell hook | Check `~/.claude/settings.json` `hooks` key for the matcher |

Batch the Bash calls where possible — chain `which` checks for CLIs in one
command, `ls` checks for agents in one call. Don't burn 20 separate Bash
invocations on what could be 3.

## Step 4 — Report + prompt per finding

After checks complete, print a summary before prompting anything:

```
### Setup audit

Checked: <N> items across <M> categories from install.md

Present:  <count>
Missing:  <count> (<low> low-risk, <med> medium-risk, <high> high-friction)
```

Then iterate through missing items, grouped by tier. For each low and
medium-risk item, use AskUserQuestion with the options:
- `[install]` — run the fix now
- `[skip]`    — do not install; leave the item missing; continue
- `[abort]`   — stop the skill; exit with a summary

For high-friction items, print the copy-pasteable instructions without a
prompt — the user applies them manually.

When the user chooses `[install]` for a medium-risk item, run the install
command via Bash. Report success or failure. Do not catch-and-hide errors;
if `npm install -g task-master-ai` fails, show the error and move on to the
next item.

## Step 5 — Final summary

When all items have been processed, print:

```
### Setup audit — complete

Before:  <N> missing
Installed this run: <count>
Still missing (skipped or high-friction pending manual action): <count>
  - <item1>  [reason: <skipped | manual action needed>]
  - <item2>  ...

Next steps:
  <if any high-friction items> Apply the printed instructions above, then re-run /update-tools.
  <if all clean> Setup verified. Proceed to onboarding v0 (or your next action).
```

Exit cleanly. Do not leave ambiguous state.

## Scope limits

- Do NOT install anything install.md doesn't list. If the user has a custom
  agent not in install.md, that's their own call.
- Do NOT modify project files outside of running install commands. No edits
  to the consumer project's code, CLAUDE.md, or command-center/.
- Do NOT run the skill recursively. If a user invokes /update-tools from
  within another skill's invocation, proceed once and return.
- Do NOT attempt to update auto-claude itself (the brain). Brain updates
  flow through `auto-claude sync`, not through this skill.

## What to do on errors

- **install.md not found:** abort with clear instructions (step 1).
- **Individual install command fails:** report the error, continue with the
  next item. Do not abort the whole audit on one failure.
- **User chooses `[abort]` mid-run:** print the summary of what was already
  installed this run, and exit.
- **Ambiguous check (e.g. agent name appears in multiple sources):** report
  as present if any matching file exists. Don't attempt to disambiguate.

## Invocation hint

If the user invoked this skill with no arguments, run the full audit.
If the user passes a subcommand like `/update-tools agents` or
`/update-tools mcps`, scope the audit to that category only.

Recognized subcommand filters (optional):
- `agents` — only check sections 2a/2b/2c
- `skills` — only check sections 3a/3b/3c
- `mcps` — only check section 5
- `clis` — only check section 1
- `plugins` — only check section 4
- `shell` — only check section 6
