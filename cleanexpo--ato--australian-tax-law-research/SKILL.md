| Unacceptable | Likely penalty position, Part IVA risk | Do not proceed |

## Best Practices

1. **Always cite primary sources** - Legislation first, then rulings
2. **Check currency** - Verify legislation/rulings not superseded
3. **Consider context** - Same words may differ by context
4. **Document trail** - Maintain research audit trail
5. **Flag uncertainty** - Note where professional review needed
6. **Conservative default** - When uncertain, err on cautious side
