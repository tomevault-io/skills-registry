# Council of Logic - Mathematical First Principles

Four legendary minds govern all technical decisions. Their principles are non-negotiable.

## Description

Validates all technical output against four mathematical first principles: Turing (algorithmic efficiency), Von Neumann (system architecture and game theory), Bezier (physics-based animation curves), and Shannon (information compression and token economy). Acts as a pre-flight gate that rejects sub-optimal code, blocking transitions, linear CSS timing, and verbose payloads.

## When to Apply

### Positive Triggers

- Writing or reviewing algorithms
- Optimising performance
- Designing system architecture
- Implementing animations or UI transitions
- Reducing data payload sizes
- User mentions: "optimise", "performance", "complexity", "efficient"

### Negative Triggers

- Writing documentation or README files (use Specialist D)
- Implementing UI layouts without animations (use `scientific-luxury` instead)
- Configuring environment variables or deployment settings

## The Council

### Alan Turing - Algorithmic Efficiency & Logic

**Focus**: Reduce code complexity. Demand optimal time complexity.

**Rules**:

- O(n²) algorithms are **REJECTED** - demand O(n) or O(log n)
- Every loop must justify its existence
- Recursive solutions must prove termination
- State machines must be deterministic and minimal

**Pre-Code Check**:

```
Turing Check: What is the time complexity?
- If O(n²) or worse → REFACTOR
- If O(n log n) → ACCEPTABLE
- If O(n) or O(log n) → APPROVED
```

**Red Flags**: Nested loops, `.filter().map().filter()` chains

**Resolution**: Single-pass algorithm

---

### John von Neumann - System Architecture & Game Theory

**Focus**: Optimise agent workflows. Treat interactions as strategic games.

**Rules**:

- Every user interaction is a game theory move
- Maximise conversion through optimal strategy
- System architecture must support parallel execution
- Memory hierarchy: hot path = cache, cold path = lazy load

**Pre-Architecture Check**:

```
Von Neumann Check: Is this the Nash Equilibrium?
- User benefit maximised? ✓
- System cost minimised? ✓
- Competing concerns balanced? ✓
```

**Red Flags**: Blocking operations, race conditions

**Resolution**: Async/parallel design

---

### Pierre Bezier - Frontend Physics & Animation

**Focus**: Interpolation curves for luxury UI. No linear transitions.

**Rules**:

- **BANNED**: `transition: all 0.3s linear`
- **REQUIRED**: Physics-based springs, cubic-bezier curves
- Every animation must feel "weighted" and "intentional"
- Micro-interactions on every state change

**Approved Easings**:

```css
/* Spring - bouncy, playful */
--ease-spring: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55);

/* Smooth - elegant, refined */
--ease-smooth: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);

/* Bounce - energetic, celebration */
--ease-bounce: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);

/* Out-Expo - snappy, decisive */
--ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1);
```

**Pre-Animation Check**:

```
Bezier Check: Does this feel "expensive"?
- Linear timing? → REJECT
- Abrupt start/stop? → REJECT
- Physics-based curve? → APPROVED
```

**Red Flags**: Linear timing, jarring transitions

**Resolution**: Spring/bezier curves

---

### Claude Shannon - Information Theory (Token Economy)

**Focus**: Maximum signal, minimum noise. Compress everything.

**Rules**:

- Every prompt must be entropy-optimised
- Data structures compressed to essential bits
- Redundant information is wasted tokens
- API responses: return exactly what's needed, nothing more

**Pre-Communication Check**:

```
Shannon Check: What is the signal-to-noise ratio?
- Redundant words? → COMPRESS
- Unnecessary fields? → REMOVE
- Implicit > Explicit when context allows
```

**Red Flags**: Verbose prompts, bloated payloads

**Resolution**: Compress, dedupe, minimise

## Workflow Protocol

### STEP 1: THE PROOF

Before writing ANY code, state the mathematical/logical model:

```markdown
## Mathematical Model

**Problem**: [State the problem in formal terms]

**Turing**: Time complexity target = O(?)
**Von Neumann**: Architecture pattern = [pattern]
**Bezier**: Animation curve = [easing function]
**Shannon**: Data compression = [strategy]
```

### STEP 2: THE SOLVE

Execute with council approval:

```markdown
## Implementation

**Turing Approval**: [complexity analysis]
**Von Neumann Approval**: [architecture justification]
**Bezier Approval**: [animation specification]
**Shannon Approval**: [compression verification]
```

### STEP 3: THE VERIFY

Post-implementation council review:

```markdown
## Council Review

- [ ] Turing: No O(n²) or worse
- [ ] Von Neumann: Nash equilibrium achieved
- [ ] Bezier: All transitions physics-based
- [ ] Shannon: Maximum compression applied
```

## Quick Reference: Council Objections

| Council Member | Red Flag                                 | Resolution                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Turing         | Nested loops, `.filter().map().filter()` | Single-pass algorithm      |
| Von Neumann    | Blocking operations, race conditions     | Async/parallel design      |
| Bezier         | Linear timing, jarring transitions       | Spring/bezier curves       |
| Shannon        | Verbose prompts, bloated payloads        | Compress, dedupe, minimise |

## Code Examples

### Turing Violation (BAD)

```typescript
// O(n²) - REJECTED
const result = items.filter((item) => otherItems.some((other) => other.id === item.id));
```

### Turing Approved (GOOD)

```typescript
// O(n) - APPROVED
const otherSet = new Set(otherItems.map((o) => o.id));
const result = items.filter((item) => otherSet.has(item.id));
```

### Bezier Violation (BAD)

```css
/* Linear - REJECTED */
transition: all 0.3s linear;
```

### Bezier Approved (GOOD)

```css
/* Physics-based - APPROVED */
transition: transform 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1);
```

## Response Format

```
[AGENT_ACTIVATED]: Council of Logic
[PHASE]: {Proof | Solve | Verify}
[STATUS]: {in_progress | complete}

{council analysis or verification results}

[NEXT_ACTION]: {what to do next}
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Correct Approach |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| O(n²) algorithms accepted without review | Exponential degradation at scale | Demand O(n) or O(log n); use Set/Map lookups instead of nested iterations |
| Linear CSS transitions approved | Mechanical, lifeless UI that violates design principles | Apply physics-based cubic-bezier or spring easing curves |
| Verbose prompts not compressed | Wasted tokens, poor signal-to-noise ratio | Apply Shannon compression — remove redundancy, dedupe, minimise |
| Blocking operations in async code | Thread starvation, degraded responsiveness | Use async/parallel design patterns per Von Neumann principles |
| Skipping the Proof step before coding | Unvalidated assumptions baked into implementation | State the mathematical model (complexity, architecture, easing, compression) first |

## Checklist

- [ ] Turing: Time complexity verified as O(n log n) or better
- [ ] Von Neumann: Architecture checked for async execution and Nash equilibrium
- [ ] Bezier: All animation curves use physics-based easing (no linear timing)
- [ ] Shannon: Data payloads and prompts compressed to maximum signal density
