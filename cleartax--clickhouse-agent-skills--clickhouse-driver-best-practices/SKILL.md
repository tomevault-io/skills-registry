# ClickHouse Driver Best Practices

12 rules for building reliable ClickHouse client libraries and integrations — covering connection management, retry handling, query execution, and observability.

## IMPORTANT: How to Apply This Skill

**Before building or reviewing ClickHouse client code, follow this priority order:**

1. **Check for applicable rules** in the `rules/` directory
2. **If rules exist:** Apply them and cite them using "Per `rule-name`..."
3. **If no rule exists:** Use general distributed systems / database driver knowledge
4. **Always cite your source:** rule name or general guidance

**Why this matters:** ClickHouse uses HTTP/native protocols with unique behaviors (async server-side execution, query_log tracking, LZ4 compression, MergeTree-specific error codes) where standard JDBC/database driver patterns are insufficient.

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix | Rules |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Retry & Resilience | CRITICAL | `retry-` | 3 |
| 2 | Connection Management | CRITICAL | `conn-` | 3 |
| 3 | Query Execution | HIGH | `query-` | 3 |
| 4 | Observability | HIGH | `obs-` | 3 |

## When to Apply

This skill activates when you encounter:

- ClickHouse client library or driver code
- Spring Boot ClickHouse integration setup
- JDBC or HTTP connection configuration for ClickHouse
- Retry policies for database operations
- Query timeout handling
- ClickHouse connection pooling or multi-tenant setup
- Query logging or performance monitoring for ClickHouse

**Do NOT activate for:** ClickHouse SQL optimization, schema design, or query tuning — use `clickhouse-best-practices` for that.

## Examples

### Example 1: Add retry logic to ClickHouse JDBC

User says: "Add retry handling to our ClickHouse queries"

1. Read `rules/retry-only-transient-errors.md` — only retry network/connection errors
2. Read `rules/retry-use-transparent-proxy.md` — apply retry via proxy, not caller changes
3. Read `rules/retry-structured-logging.md` — log WARN per attempt, ERROR on exhaustion

Result: Retry policy that retries `CannotGetJdbcConnectionException` and network errors, with fixed backoff and structured logging.

### Example 2: Handle mutation timeouts

User says: "Our ClickHouse inserts sometimes timeout but the data still gets written"

1. Read `rules/query-assign-mutation-id.md` — always assign UUID queryId to mutations
2. Read `rules/query-poll-on-timeout.md` — poll system.query_log on timeout, don't fail
3. Read `rules/obs-log-query-timing.md` — log query execution time for diagnosis

Result: Mutation wrapper that assigns queryId, catches timeout (error 159), and polls query_log for up to 5 minutes.

## Common Mistakes to Watch For

- **Retrying all errors**: Retrying query syntax errors or constraint violations wastes resources and delays failure
- **No queryId on mutations**: Without a queryId, you cannot determine if a timed-out write succeeded server-side
- **Failing on client timeout**: A client-side read timeout (error 159) does NOT mean the server operation failed
- **Same timeout for all paths**: JDBC and HTTP paths need independent timeout configuration
- **Not closing responses**: ClickHouseResponse objects must always be closed to prevent resource leaks
- **Index-based column access**: Using column indices instead of names makes code brittle to schema changes

## For Formal Reviews

When reviewing ClickHouse driver code, consult `references/review-checklist.md` for the full checklist.

## Performance Notes

- Take your time to verify retry policies only cover transient errors
- Check that every mutation path assigns a queryId
- Verify all ClickHouseResponse objects are closed in finally/usingWhen blocks

## Rule File Structure

Each rule file in `rules/` contains:

- **YAML frontmatter**: title, impact level, tags
- **Brief explanation**: Why this rule matters
- **Incorrect example**: Anti-pattern with explanation
- **Correct example**: Best practice with explanation
- **Additional context**: Trade-offs, when to apply
