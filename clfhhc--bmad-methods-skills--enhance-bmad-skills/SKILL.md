# Enhance Skill

## Overview

AI-driven skill for reviewing and adapting BMAD-converted skills. Detects path references that need adaptation and prompts the user for how to handle each case.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- **Review** a converted skill for path adaptation needs
- **Scan** all skills for remaining `{project-root}` references
- **Migrate** external content into a skill
- **Adapt** paths to use relative skill structure

## Commands

- **`ES or enhance-bmad-skills`** - Start skill enhancement workflow
- **`SP or scan-paths`** - Scan for path references in one or all skills
- **`AR or adapt-references`** - Adapt detected path references with user prompts
- **`MF or migrate-file`** - Migrate external file into skill structure

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Path Detection

When reviewing a skill, look for these patterns:

```
{project-root}/_bmad/...       # Most common - internal BMAD references
{project-root}/...             # User project paths
../../module/skill/...         # Already-adapted relative paths
```

For each `{project-root}` reference found, categorize it:

| Category | Pattern Example | Description |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Actionable** | `Load COMPLETE file {project-root}/_bmad/...` | Path in instructions that needs adaptation |
| **Documentation** | In code blocks, tables, or "Wrong/Fix" examples | Keep as-is - teaching content |
| **External** | `{project-root}/finances/` | User's project path - document as requirement |

### Step 2: User Prompt

For each **Actionable** reference, present options:

```
Found: {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/data/documentation-standards.md
  in: skills/bmm/tech-writer/SKILL.md (line 25)

Options:
  [A] Adapt - Change to relative path (../../data/documentation-standards.md)
  [M] Migrate - Copy file into skill, update reference
  [D] Document - Mark as external dependency
  [K] Keep - Leave as-is (if documentation example)

Choose [A/M/D/K]:
```

### Step 3: Execute Choice

**[A] Adapt Path:**
- Replace `{project-root}/_bmad/module/path` with relative `../../module/path`
- Verify target file exists in skills structure
- If not found, suggest migration instead

**[M] Migrate Content:**
- Determine target location: `skills/{module}/{skill}/data/{filename}`
- Copy file to skill directory
- Update reference to use relative path `./data/{filename}`
- Report migration details

**[D] Document External:**
- Add to skill's "External Dependencies" section
- Note file purpose and requirement

**[K] Keep As-Is:**
- Mark as documentation example
- No changes made

## Path Transformation Reference

### Common Transformations

| Original Path | Transformed Path |
|---------------|------------------|
| `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/data/file.md` | `../../data/file.md` (from skill) |
| `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/testarch/knowledge/` | `../../tea/knowledge/` (if migrated) |
| `{project-root}/_bmad/{module}/workflows/...` | `../../{workflow}/SKILL.md` |

### Common Adaptation Scenarios

You may encounter these common patterns that require specific handling:

1. **Data File References**
   - Pattern: References to centralized data files (e.g., `_bmad/bmm/data/...`).
   - Action: **Migrate** these files into the skill's own `data/` directory to make it self-contained.

2. **Knowledge Bases**
   - Pattern: References to knowledge directories (e.g., `_bmad/bmm/testarch/knowledge/`).
   - Action: **Migrate** the directory into the skill and update the path to be relative.

3. **Cross-Module Examples**
   - Pattern: References to other modules in examples (e.g., `_bmad/cis/tasks/...` in a different module).
   - Action: **Keep In Place** (Document) or **Adapt** to a relative path if the target skill is also installed.

## Quick Scan Command

To scan all skills for remaining path issues:

```
Scan all skills in skills/ directory for {project-root} references.
Categorize each as: Actionable, Documentation, or External.
Report skills needing attention with line numbers.
```

## Guidelines

- Always verify target file exists before adapting paths
- Prefer migration for small files (<100 lines)
- Keep documentation examples as-is - they teach BMAD patterns
- Update skill's Related Skills section if paths change workflow references

## Examples

**Enhance a specific skill:**
```
Enhance skills/bmm/tech-writer/SKILL.md
```

**Scan all skills:**
```
SP
```

**Migrate a file into skill:**
```
MF skills/bmm/tech-writer documentation-standards.md from ../../data/
```
