# Unwinding Codebase

**Requires:** `docs/unwind/architecture.md`
**Produces:** `docs/unwind/layers/*/` folders via subagents (each with index.md + section files)

**Principles:** See `analysis-principles.md` - completeness, machine-readable, link to source, no commentary, **incremental writes**.

## Process

### Step 1: Parse Architecture Document

1. Read `docs/unwind/architecture.md`
2. Extract `repository.link_format` for source linking
3. Extract YAML `layers` block
4. Build dependency graph
5. Skip layers with `status: not_detected`

### Step 2: Execution Phases

```
Phase 1: database (no dependencies)
Phase 2: domain_model (needs database)
Phase 3: service_layer (needs domain_model)
Phase 4: api, messaging (parallel - need service_layer)
Phase 5: frontend (optional - needs api)
Phase 6: unit_tests, integration_tests, e2e_tests (parallel - no layer dependencies)
```

### Step 3: Dispatch Subagents

For each layer, dispatch:

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose")
  description: "Analyze [layer] layer"
  prompt: |
    Use unwind:analyzing-[layer]-layer to analyze this codebase layer.

    Entry points from architecture.md:
    [entry_points]

    SOURCE LINKING - Use this format for all source references:
    [link_format from architecture.md]

    Replace {path}, {start}, {end} with actual values.
    Example: [UserService.ts]([link_format with path=src/services/UserService.ts, start=45, end=67])

    IMPORTANT: Write incrementally to folder structure.
    1. Create docs/unwind/layers/[layer]/ directory first
    2. Write initial index.md with skeleton sections
    3. Analyze each section and write its .md file IMMEDIATELY after analyzing
    4. Update index.md after each section file is written
    5. Do NOT buffer all content for a single write at the end

    Output folder: docs/unwind/layers/[layer]/
    - index.md (overview + links to sections)
    - section files per the skill spec

    Follow analysis-principles.md: completeness, machine-readable, link to source, no commentary.
```

**Parallel rules:**
- Same phase, no cross-dependencies → parallel
- Wait for phase N before phase N+1

### Step 4: Testing Analysis

After application layers complete, dispatch testing specialists in parallel:

```
- analyzing-unit-tests → unit-tests/ folder
- analyzing-integration-tests → integration-tests/ folder
- analyzing-e2e-tests → e2e-tests/ folder
```

Testing analysis can reference application layer docs for coverage mapping.

### Step 5: Gap Detection Phase

After all layer analysis completes, dispatch verification agents IN PARALLEL to find gaps:

```
For each analyzed layer:
  Task(subagent_type="general-purpose")
    description: "Find gaps in [layer] documentation"
    prompt: |
      Use unwind:verifying-layer-documentation to find gaps in the [layer] layer.

      Compare docs/unwind/layers/[layer]/ against source files.

      Output ONLY gaps to docs/unwind/layers/[layer]/gaps.md

      DO NOT write about what's correct or assign scores.
```

**Gap detection runs in parallel** - no dependencies between layers.

### Step 6: Gap Completion Phase

After gap detection, dispatch completion agents IN PARALLEL:

```
For each layer with gaps.md:
  Task(subagent_type="general-purpose")
    description: "Complete [layer] documentation gaps"
    prompt: |
      Use unwind:completing-layer-documentation to fix gaps in [layer].

      Read docs/unwind/layers/[layer]/gaps.md for the work list.

      For each missing item:
      1. Read source at specified location
      2. Add documentation to specified section file
      3. Include [MUST/SHOULD/DON'T] tag

      Delete gaps.md when complete.
```

**Completion runs in parallel** - no dependencies between layers.

### Step 7: Handoff

When completion phase done (all gaps.md files deleted):
> Layer analysis complete. Run `unwind:synthesizing-findings` to generate the strategic rebuild plan.

## Execution Example

```yaml
layers:
  database: { status: detected, dependencies: [] }
  domain_model: { status: detected, dependencies: [database] }
  service_layer: { status: detected, dependencies: [domain_model] }
  api: { status: detected, dependencies: [service_layer] }
  messaging: { status: not_detected }
  frontend: { status: detected, dependencies: [api] }
```

Execution:
1. Phase 1: `analyzing-database-layer`
2. Phase 2: `analyzing-domain-model`
3. Phase 3: `analyzing-service-layer`
4. Phase 4: `analyzing-api-layer` (messaging skipped)
5. Phase 5: `analyzing-frontend-layer`
6. Phase 6: `analyzing-unit-tests`, `analyzing-integration-tests`, `analyzing-e2e-tests` (parallel)
7. **Phase 7: Gap Detection** - `verifying-layer-documentation` for all layers (parallel) → gaps.md
8. **Phase 8: Gap Completion** - `completing-layer-documentation` for all layers (parallel)
9. Handoff to synthesis

## Refresh Mode

If layer folders exist:
1. Pass existing index.md and section files as context
2. Subagents add `## Changes Since Last Review` to index.md
