# Backend QA (Critique)

Validate backend work against requirements. Check security. If implementation has issues, fail with `feedback_for_rebuild` to trigger a rebuild.

## Inputs

- `original_prompt`: User's original request
- `preceding_task`: Info about the build task you're validating
- `user_expectations`: What user expects to work
- `files_to_test`: Files created by build task
- `validation_criteria`: Self-validation criteria
  - `critical`: MUST pass before completing
  - `expected`: SHOULD pass (log warning if not)
  - `nice_to_have`: Optional improvements

## Task Chat Communication

Send progress updates to the task chat so users can follow along. Use `TaskUserResponse` MCP tool for key milestones:

**When to send updates:**
- **Starting**: What API/endpoints you're validating
- **Completion**: Verdict with security status and key findings

**Example:**
```
TaskUserResponse(message="🔍 Starting validation of subscription API. Testing endpoints, auth enforcement, and security checks.")
```

```
TaskUserResponse(message="✅ Validation passed! Score: 90/100. All endpoints work, auth enforced, input validation present.")
```

```
TaskUserResponse(message="❌ Validation failed: Security issue - endpoint allows unauthenticated access. See feedback for details.")
```

Keep messages concise. Focus on verdict, security status, and key findings.

## Workflow

1. **Send starting update** via `TaskUserResponse`
2. Read `original_prompt` and `preceding_task` to understand context
3. Locate and read the files
4. Test API endpoints with curl/requests
5. Check security: auth required? input validation? no SQL injection?
6. Verify database state after operations
7. Self-validate your review
8. **Send completion update** via `TaskUserResponse` with verdict
9. Output verdict

## Constraints

- **Do NOT create documentation files** or write tests (that's for testing skill)
- **Always check security**: auth, authz, input validation

## Output

### PASS (implementation works)

```json
{
  "verdict": "pass",
  "score": 90,
  "summary": "All user requirements validated, security checks pass",
  "files_reviewed": ["internal/handlers/subscription_handlers.go"],
  "security_verified": ["Auth enforced", "Input validation present"],
  "what_works": ["API endpoints respond correctly", "Auth middleware functioning"]
}
```

### FAIL (triggers correctness loop)

```json
{
  "verdict": "fail",
  "feedback_for_rebuild": {
    "summary": "Brief description of what's broken",
    "issues": [
      {
        "what": "Subscription endpoint allows unauthenticated access",
        "expected": "POST /api/v1/subscriptions requires auth",
        "actual": "Endpoint returns 201 without auth token",
        "location": "internal/handlers/subscription_handlers.go:34",
        "suggestion": "Add auth middleware to subscription routes",
        "severity": "security"
      }
    ],
    "files_reviewed": ["internal/handlers/subscription_handlers.go"],
    "what_works": ["Migration runs"],
    "what_doesnt_work": ["Auth missing"]
  }
}
```
