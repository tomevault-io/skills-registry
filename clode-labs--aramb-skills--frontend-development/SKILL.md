# Frontend Development

Build components following project patterns. Write accessible, responsive code with TypeScript.

## Inputs

- `requirements`: What to build
- `files_to_create`: Files to create
- `files_to_modify`: Existing files to modify
- `patterns_to_follow`: Reference patterns in codebase

## Constraints

- Functional components and hooks only
- Semantic HTML elements
- **Do NOT create documentation files** unless explicitly requested
- **Do NOT run npm install, build, lint, or tests** - just write the code
- **Do NOT attempt deployment** - this skill is for development only

## Task Chat Communication

Send progress updates to the task chat so users can follow along. Use `TaskUserResponse` MCP tool for key milestones:

**When to send updates:**
- **Starting**: Brief summary of what you're about to build
- **Key milestones**: After completing significant components or steps
- **Completion**: Summary of what was accomplished with key details

**Example:**
```
TaskUserResponse(message="🚀 Starting to build the calculator. Creating Calculator, Display, ButtonPanel, and Button components with TypeScript.")
```

```
TaskUserResponse(message="✅ Calculator complete! Created 4 components with full arithmetic logic, keyboard support, and error handling. Run `npm run dev` to test.")
```

Keep messages concise (1-2 sentences). Focus on what the user cares about.

## Workflow

1. **Send starting update** via `TaskUserResponse`
2. Write all required files
3. **Send completion update** via `TaskUserResponse` with summary
4. Report what was created in outputs

## Output

```json
{
  "files_created": ["src/App.tsx", "src/components/Game.tsx"],
  "files_modified": [],
  "framework": "React 18 with TypeScript",
  "commands": {
    "install": "npm install",
    "dev": "npm run dev"
  }
}
```
