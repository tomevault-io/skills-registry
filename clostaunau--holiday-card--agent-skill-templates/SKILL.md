# Agent & Skill Templates

## Purpose

This skill provides comprehensive templates, patterns, and examples for creating well-structured Claude Code subagents and skills. Use this as a reference when building new agents or skills, or when improving existing ones.

## Best Practices Summary

### For Subagents

1. **Single Responsibility**: One clear, focused purpose
2. **Tool Minimalism**: Only grant necessary tools
3. **Clear Descriptions**: Keyword-rich, specific, 20+ words
4. **Explicit Output**: Define exact format in system prompt
5. **Appropriate Proactivity**: Most agents should be `proactive: false`
6. **Comprehensive Prompts**: Role, responsibilities, guidelines, constraints, examples

### For Skills

1. **Clear Instructions**: Step-by-step, actionable guidance
2. **Comprehensive Examples**: Both good and bad with explanations
3. **Focused Scope**: One domain/topic per skill, under 500 lines
4. **Supporting Files**: Templates, examples, scripts well-organized
5. **Best Practices**: Document "why" not just "what"
6. **Common Pitfalls**: Show mistakes and how to avoid them

## Quality Checklist

### Before Creating an Agent
- [ ] Is a subagent the right tool? (vs skill or just asking Claude)
- [ ] Is the scope focused enough? (single responsibility)
- [ ] Have I minimized the tool set?
- [ ] Is the description clear and keyword-rich?
- [ ] Is the output format explicitly defined?
- [ ] Have I included examples in the system prompt?
- [ ] Are constraints clearly stated?

### Before Creating a Skill
- [ ] Is a skill the right tool? (vs subagent)
- [ ] Is the scope focused enough? (one domain/topic)
- [ ] Are instructions step-by-step and actionable?
- [ ] Do I have comprehensive examples (good & bad)?
- [ ] Are supporting files needed and created?
- [ ] Are best practices documented?
- [ ] Are common pitfalls covered?
- [ ] Is it under 500 lines? (if not, should it be split?)
