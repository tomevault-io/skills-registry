# Anclax Development Workflow

Use Anclax generated types as the contract between layers and keep specs/SQL as the source of truth.

## Design principles

- Singleton services with dependency injection.
- High cohesion, low coupling.

## Core flow

1. Inspect `anclax.yaml` to learn generation paths and enabled generators.
2. Update sources first:
   - OpenAPI: the matching `oapi-codegen` entry `path` (commonly `api/v1.yaml`)
   - Tasks: the matching `task-handler` entry `path` (commonly `api/tasks.yaml`)
   - DB schema: `sql/migrations`
   - Queries: `sql/queries`
3. Run `anclax gen` after any spec/SQL/Wire changes.
4. If you modify `examples/`, run `make gen` to refresh `cmd/anclax/initFiles` and normalize template-specific `go.mod` content.
5. Implement code against generated interfaces and types.
6. Add unit tests for service logic with mocks.

## Layering rules

- Handler: parse HTTP, call service, map errors to HTTP responses.
- Service: implement business logic, accept and return `apigen` types.
- Model: use `pkg/zcore/model` and sqlc-generated queries.
- Async tasks: define in the task spec configured under `task-handler` (commonly `api/tasks.yaml`), implement `taskgen.ExecutorInterface`, enqueue via `taskgen.TaskRunner`.
