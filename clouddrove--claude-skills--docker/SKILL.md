# Docker Operations & Best Practices

This skill covers Docker operations (building, running, debugging containers), Dockerfile best practices, Docker Compose workflows, image optimization, and registry management.

**Scripts:** Always run scripts with `--help` first. Do not read script source unless debugging the script itself.

**References:** Load reference files on demand based on the task at hand. Do not pre-load all references.

**Slash commands:** Users can also invoke these directly:
- `/docker-skills:docker-debug [container]` — Diagnose a running or failed container
- `/docker-skills:docker-build [context]` — Build, tag, and validate a Docker image
- `/docker-skills:docker-optimize [image]` — Analyze an image and suggest size reductions

## Dockerfile Best Practices Quick Ref

Follow these rules in order of importance:

1. **Use specific base image tags** — Never use `:latest` in production. Pin to a digest or exact version (e.g., `node:20.11-alpine3.19`).

2. **Order layers from least to most frequently changing:**
   ```
   FROM base          # Rarely changes
   RUN apt-get ...    # OS deps change infrequently
   COPY package.json  # Dependency manifest changes sometimes
   RUN npm install    # Deps rebuild only when manifest changes
   COPY . .           # App code changes every build
   RUN npm run build  # Build step runs on code changes
   ```

3. **Use multi-stage builds** — Separate build-time tools from runtime image. Build stage installs compilers, dev dependencies; runtime stage copies only artifacts.

4. **Combine RUN commands** — Merge related `RUN` instructions with `&&` to reduce layers. Always clean up in the same layer (`apt-get install && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`).

5. **Leverage BuildKit cache mounts** — Use `--mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm` for package manager caches to speed up rebuilds.

6. **Use `.dockerignore`** — Exclude `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.env`, `*.md`, test fixtures, and build artifacts.

7. **Run as non-root** — Add `USER nonroot` or `USER 1001` after creating the user. Never run production containers as root.

8. **Use COPY, not ADD** — `ADD` has implicit tar extraction and URL fetching. Use `COPY` unless you specifically need those features.

9. **Prefer exec form for CMD/ENTRYPOINT** — Use `CMD ["node", "server.js"]` not `CMD node server.js`. Exec form handles signals correctly.

10. **Add HEALTHCHECK** — Define health endpoints so orchestrators can detect unhealthy containers.

11. **Pin package versions** — Use `apt-get install curl=7.88.1-10` and lock files for reproducible builds.

12. **Don't store secrets in images** — Use BuildKit `--mount=type=secret` for build-time secrets. Never use `ARG` or `ENV` for secrets.

## Docker Compose Quick Ref

### Service Pattern

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src          # Bind mount for dev hot-reload
      - node_modules:/app/node_modules  # Named volume for deps
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - backend
```

### Key Patterns

- **depends_on with healthcheck** — Use `condition: service_healthy` so services wait for real readiness, not just container start.
- **Named volumes** — Use for persistent data (databases). Survive `docker compose down`.
- **Bind mounts** — Use for development hot-reload. Map host code into container.
- **Custom networks** — Services on the same network reach each other by service name (DNS).
- **env_file** — Keep secrets out of `docker-compose.yml`. Use `.env` for local, `env_file:` for explicit files.
- **Variable interpolation** — Use `${VAR:-default}` in compose files. Docker Compose reads `.env` automatically.
- **Profiles** — Tag optional services (e.g., monitoring, debug) with `profiles: [debug]`. Start with `--profile debug`.
- **Override files** — `docker-compose.override.yml` auto-loaded for local dev overrides. Use `-f base.yml -f prod.yml` for environments.

For complete Compose patterns including networking, profiles, multi-file setups, and a full-stack example, read [Compose Reference](./references/compose.md).

## Container Troubleshooting Decision Tree

Follow the diagnostic path: **ps → logs → inspect → exec**

```
Container not working?
│
├─ Won't start at all
│  ├─ Check: docker logs <container>
│  ├─ Check: docker inspect <container> → State.Error
│  ├─ Entrypoint/CMD error?
│  │  ├─ "exec format error" → Wrong platform or missing shebang
│  │  ├─ "not found" → Binary missing or wrong base image
│  │  └─ "permission denied" → File not executable or USER lacks permissions
│  ├─ Missing dependencies?
│  │  └─ "shared library not found" → Missing OS packages in runtime image
│  └─ Port conflict?
│     └─ "address already in use" → Another process using that port
│
├─ Exits immediately (code 0 or 1)
│  ├─ Exit code 0 → CMD completed and exited. Need a foreground process
│  ├─ Exit code 1 → Application error on startup. Check logs
│  ├─ Using shell form? → Switch to exec form for proper signal handling
│  └─ Check: docker run -it <image> /bin/sh → Debug interactively
│
├─ OOMKilled (exit code 137)
│  ├─ Check: docker inspect <container> | jq '.[0].State.OOMKilled'
│  ├─ Check: docker stats (watch memory usage)
│  ├─ Increase --memory limit
│  └─ Profile application for memory leaks
│
├─ Networking issues
│  ├─ Port not accessible?
│  │  ├─ Check: docker port <container> → Verify port mapping
│  │  ├─ App binding to localhost? → Must bind to 0.0.0.0 inside container
│  │  └─ Firewall? → Check host firewall rules
│  ├─ Container-to-container DNS fails?
│  │  ├─ Same network? → docker network inspect <network>
│  │  └─ Use service name, not container ID, for DNS
│  └─ Can't reach host?
│     └─ Use host.docker.internal (Docker Desktop) or --network host
│
├─ Volume/mount issues
│  ├─ Permission denied on mounted files?
│  │  ├─ UID/GID mismatch between host and container user
│  │  └─ Fix: match USER uid with host file owner, or use --user flag
│  ├─ Files not appearing?
│  │  ├─ Wrong host path → Use absolute paths
│  │  └─ Named volume masking bind mount → Check volume precedence
│  └─ Data lost on restart?
│     └─ Use named volumes, not anonymous volumes
│
└─ Build fails
   ├─ COPY file not found → File excluded by .dockerignore or wrong context
   ├─ apt-get fails → Add --no-install-recommends, run apt-get update first
   ├─ Cache not working → Layer ordering wrong (see best practices above)
   └─ BuildKit syntax error → Check # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1 directive
```

## Image Optimization Checklist

Follow these steps to reduce image size, roughly in order of impact:

1. **Switch to a smaller base image** — `alpine` (5 MB), `slim` (80 MB), `distroless` (20 MB), or `scratch` (0 B) instead of full Debian/Ubuntu (120+ MB).

2. **Use multi-stage builds** — Build in a full image, copy only the binary/artifacts to a minimal runtime image. Typical 10x-50x reduction.

3. **Remove build dependencies** — Don't install compilers, headers, or dev packages in the final stage.

4. **Clean up package manager caches in the same layer** — `RUN apt-get install -y pkg && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` (must be same `RUN` to save space).

5. **Use `.dockerignore`** — Prevent `.git/` (often 100+ MB), `node_modules/`, test fixtures, and docs from entering build context.

6. **Minimize layers** — Combine related `RUN` commands. Each layer adds overhead.

7. **Use BuildKit cache mounts** — `--mount=type=cache` for pip, npm, apt caches. Faster builds without bloating the image.

8. **Strip binaries** — For compiled languages, strip debug symbols (`strip --strip-all binary` or `-ldflags="-s -w"` in Go).

9. **Audit with dive** — Run `dive <image>` to inspect each layer and find wasted space.

10. **Check with docker scout** — Run `docker scout cves <image>` to find vulnerabilities and `docker scout recommendations <image>` for base image suggestions.

11. **Use `docker history`** — Run `docker history <image>` to see per-layer sizes and identify bloated layers.

12. **Compress assets** — For web apps, pre-compress static files. Remove source maps in production.

For multi-stage Dockerfile examples and base image comparison, read [Dockerfile Reference](./references/dockerfile.md).

## Diagnostic Scripts

### Image Audit

Run `bash scripts/image-audit.sh --help` for full usage.

Analyzes a Docker image for size optimization opportunities: layer-by-layer breakdown, identifies large files, detects unnecessary packages, checks for common anti-patterns (running as root, no healthcheck, unneeded cache dirs).

```bash
# Audit a specific image
bash scripts/image-audit.sh myapp:latest

# Audit with detailed layer breakdown
bash scripts/image-audit.sh myapp:latest --layers

# Compare two images
bash scripts/image-audit.sh myapp:v1 --compare myapp:v2
```

### Compose Check

Run `bash scripts/compose-check.sh --help` for full usage.

Validates a Docker Compose file: checks for missing healthchecks, hardcoded secrets, missing restart policies, privileged mode, volume backup needs, and network isolation gaps.

```bash
# Check compose file in current directory
bash scripts/compose-check.sh

# Check a specific file
bash scripts/compose-check.sh -f docker-compose.prod.yml

# Check with strict mode (warnings become errors)
bash scripts/compose-check.sh --strict
```
