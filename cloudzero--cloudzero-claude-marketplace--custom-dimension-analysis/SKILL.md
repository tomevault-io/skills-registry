# Custom Dimension Analysis

## Purpose
This skill analyzes cloud costs through the lens of organization-specific custom dimensions (User:Defined:*) created via CloudZero's CostFormation, enabling business-aligned cost visibility, accurate attribution, and effective showback/chargeback.

## When to Use
- "Show me costs by [team/product/feature]"
- "What do our teams spend on cloud?"
- "Break down costs by business unit"
- "Analyze spending by application"
- "Which product costs the most?"
- Showback and chargeback reporting
- Business-aligned cost discussions
- Product P&L analysis
- Team budget tracking
- Keywords: team, product, feature, business unit, application, custom, showback, chargeback, by [custom dimension name]

## Prerequisites

This skill builds on the **understand-cloudzero-organization** skill.

Before applying this procedure:
- If you haven't already in this session, load the understand-cloudzero-organization skill and follow its instructions
- Reference the cached organization context (don't reload unnecessarily)
- This is especially critical for custom dimension analysis as org context defines what custom dimensions exist and their business meanings

## How This Skill Works

### Step 1: Discover Custom Dimensions
Identify all custom dimensions available:

```
get_available_dimensions(filter="User:Defined")
```

This returns organization-specific dimensions like:
- User:Defined:Team
- User:Defined:Product
- User:Defined:Feature
- User:Defined:Environment
- User:Defined:CostCenter
- User:Defined:BusinessUnit
- User:Defined:Application
- [Others specific to organization]

### Step 2: Identify Relevant Dimension
Based on user request and org context, select the appropriate dimension:

```
# If user asks about "teams"
get_dimension_values(dimension="User:Defined:Team")

# If user asks about "products"
get_dimension_values(dimension="User:Defined:Product")
```

Review values to understand:
- What values exist
- How many distinct values
- Naming conventions used

### Step 3: High-Level Cost Breakdown
Query costs by the primary custom dimension:

```
get_cost_data(
    group_by=["User:Defined:Team"],
    cost_type="real_cost",
    limit=50
)
```

From this:
- Calculate total spend per dimension value
- Calculate percentage of total for each
- Identify top and bottom spenders
- Calculate distribution statistics

### Step 4: Trend Analysis by Custom Dimension
Understand how each dimension value's costs trend over time:

```
get_cost_data(
    group_by=["User:Defined:Team"],
    granularity="daily",
    cost_type="real_cost",
    limit=15
)
```

For each dimension value:
- Calculate growth rate
- Identify trend direction
- Spot anomalies or spikes
- Compare trends across values

### Step 5: Cloud Service Breakdown
For each custom dimension value, understand what services they use:

```
get_cost_data(
    group_by=["User:Defined:Team", "CZ:Service"],
    cost_type="real_cost",
    limit=100
)
```

This reveals:
- Service mix per team/product
- Differences in architecture or technology choices
- Services contributing most to each dimension value's cost
- Optimization opportunities specific to dimension values

### Step 6: Infrastructure Distribution
Understand how dimension values map to infrastructure:

**By Account:**
```
get_cost_data(
    group_by=["User:Defined:Team", "CZ:Account"],
    limit=100
)
```

**By Region:**
```
get_cost_data(
    group_by=["User:Defined:Team", "CZ:Region"],
    limit=100
)
```

**By Environment (if separate from custom dimension):**
```
get_cost_data(
    group_by=["User:Defined:Team", "CZ:Tag:Environment"],
    limit=100
)
```

### Step 7: Multi-Dimensional Custom Analysis
Combine multiple custom dimensions for deeper insights:

```
get_cost_data(
    group_by=["User:Defined:BusinessUnit", "User:Defined:Product", "User:Defined:Team"],
    limit=100
)
```

This shows hierarchical cost relationships:
- Business Unit → Products → Teams
- Or other organizational structures

### Step 8: Unallocated Cost Analysis
Identify costs not assigned to custom dimensions:

```
# Compare total costs to costs with custom dimension
total_cost = get_cost_data()
allocated_cost = get_cost_data(group_by=["User:Defined:Team"])

unallocated = total_cost - sum(allocated_cost)
unallocated_percentage = (unallocated / total_cost) * 100
```

Find what's unallocated:
```
# For accounts, see which have high unallocated costs
get_cost_data(
    group_by=["CZ:Account", "User:Defined:Team"],
    limit=100
)

# For services, see which are commonly unallocated
get_cost_data(
    group_by=["CZ:Service", "User:Defined:Team"],
    limit=100
)
```

### Step 9: Comparative Analysis
Compare dimension values against each other:

**Efficiency Comparison:**
- Which teams/products are most cost-efficient?
- What do efficient teams do differently?
- Can best practices be shared?

**Size Comparison:**
- Relative spending levels
- Budget vs. actual comparisons (if budget data in org context)
- Growth rate comparisons

**Service Mix Comparison:**
- Do similar teams use similar services?
- Why do some teams spend more on specific services?
- Architectural differences between teams/products

## Common Custom Dimension Patterns

### Pattern 1: Team-Based Analysis
**Goal:** Understand which teams spend how much

**Approach:**
- Rank teams by spending
- Analyze service mix per team
- Compare efficiency across teams
- Identify growing vs. stable teams
- Share optimization wins

### Pattern 2: Product P&L
**Goal:** Attribute cloud costs to products for P&L

**Approach:**
- Full cost breakdown per product
- Include allocated shared costs
- Trend over time with revenue if available
- Calculate unit economics (cost per user, per transaction)
- Identify optimization opportunities

### Pattern 3: Environment Cost Management
**Goal:** Ensure non-prod environments are appropriately sized

**Approach:**
- Compare prod vs. staging vs. dev costs
- Calculate ratios (staging should be X% of prod)
- Identify oversized non-prod resources
- Recommend rightsizing

### Pattern 4: Business Unit Showback
**Goal:** Provide cost transparency to business units

**Approach:**
- Hierarchical breakdown (BU → Product → Team)
- Service breakdown in business terms
- Period-over-period comparison
- Budget vs. actual (if available)
- Recommendations tailored to business audience

### Pattern 5: Feature Cost Tracking
**Goal:** Understand cost of specific features

**Approach:**
- Identify infrastructure per feature
- Calculate feature costs
- Compare to feature usage/revenue
- Inform product prioritization
- Calculate ROI per feature

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Dimensional Custom Analysis
Combine multiple custom dimensions:
```
get_cost_data(
    group_by=["User:Defined:BusinessUnit", "User:Defined:Product"],
    limit=100
)
```

Creates matrix showing how products roll up to business units.

### Shared Cost Allocation
When costs are shared (e.g., shared data platform):

1. Identify shared costs
2. Define allocation methodology (by usage, by headcount, by revenue)
3. Apply allocation
4. Show allocated + direct costs per dimension

### Variance Analysis
Compare actual to expected/budgeted:
```
Variance = Actual Cost - Expected Cost
Variance % = (Variance / Expected Cost) * 100
```

Highlight dimension values over/under budget.

### Cost Optimization Scoring
For each dimension value:
```
Optimization Score = (
  (Tag Coverage % × 0.3) +
  (RI/SP Coverage % × 0.3) +
  (Rightsizing Adoption % × 0.2) +
  (Growth Control % × 0.2)
)
```

Rank dimension values by optimization maturity.

## Tips for Effective Analysis

1. **Speak business language** - Translate technical costs to business terms
2. **Make it actionable** - Every insight should suggest an action
3. **Context is everything** - Use org context to interpret results
4. **Benchmark internally** - Compare dimension values to each other
5. **Show allocation gaps** - Be transparent about unallocated costs
6. **Tell a story** - Don't just list numbers, explain what they mean
7. **Enable accountability** - Clear attribution enables cost ownership
8. **Link to outcomes** - Connect costs to business metrics when possible
