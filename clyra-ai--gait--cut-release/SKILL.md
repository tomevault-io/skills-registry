# Cut Release (Gait)

Execute this workflow for: "cut release", "ship vX.Y.Z", "push tag and monitor release."

## Scope

- Repository: `/Users/tr/gait`
- Tag source branch: `main` only
- No pre-release branch creation
- No pre-release PR creation
- Branch/PR flow is used only for hotfixes after failed checks
- No changelog editing in this skill

## Input Contract

- Mandatory input argument: `release_version`
- Normalize to `vX.Y.Z`
- If missing, resolve silently from first semantic version token in user request; otherwise use latest tag + patch increment.

## Constants

- `MAX_HOTFIX_LOOPS=2`
- `CI_TIMEOUT_MIN=25`
- `RELEASE_TIMEOUT_MIN=40`
- `POLL_SECONDS=10`

## Safety Rules

- Tag must always be created and pushed from `main`
- `main` must be fast-forward synced with `origin/main` before each tag push
- No force-push to tags
- No destructive git commands
- No commit amend unless explicitly requested
- No changelog modifications
- PR bodies/comments must use EOF heredoc (`--body-file - <<'EOF' ... EOF`)
- Do not stop at an external async gate merely because CI, review, merge, or post-merge monitoring is still in progress
- Continue waiting, polling, merging, retagging, rerunning UAT, and re-monitoring until a success condition or an explicit hard stop condition is reached

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Main Sync and Pre-Tag Validation

1. `git fetch origin main`
2. `git checkout main`
3. `git pull --ff-only origin main`
4. Ensure clean worktree (`git status --porcelain` must be empty)
5. Ensure target tag does not already exist locally/remotely
6. Run local release preflight (mirror release workflow gate coverage):
- `make prepush-full`
- `make test-v2-3-acceptance`
- `make test-v2-4-acceptance`
- `make test-packspec-tck`
- `make test-e2e`
- `go test ./internal/integration -count=1`
- `make test-chaos`
- `make test-runtime-slo`
- `make bench-check`
- `make test-v2-5-acceptance`
- `make test-context-conformance`
- `make test-context-chaos`
- `make test-release-smoke`

If any step fails, stop and report blocker.
Do not stop merely because a release run is still pending; continue polling until completion or timeout.

### Phase 1: Tag and Release Monitor

1. Create annotated tag on `main`:
- `git tag -a <version> -m "<version>"`
2. Push tag:
- `git push origin <version>`
3. Monitor GitHub workflow `release` for that tag until green (`RELEASE_TIMEOUT_MIN`)
4. If release run fails:
- classify failure as actionable, transient/infra, or non-actionable
- transient/infra: rerun workflow once, re-monitor
- actionable: go to hotfix loop
- non-actionable: stop with blocker report
5. If release is still running, keep polling until it reaches a terminal state or the timeout is hit.

### Phase 2: Post-Release UAT

1. Run full local UAT against released tag:
- `GAIT_UAT_RELEASE_VERSION=<version> bash scripts/test_uat_local.sh`
2. If UAT is green, release is complete.
3. If UAT fails:
- classify actionable vs non-actionable
- actionable: go to hotfix loop
- non-actionable: stop with blocker report
4. If UAT-related async validation is still in progress, continue waiting; async wait alone is not a blocker.

### Phase 3: Hotfix Loop (Only if Needed, Max 2)

For loop `r1..r2`:

1. Sync main:
- `git fetch origin main`
- `git checkout main`
- `git pull --ff-only origin main`

2. Create hotfix branch:
- `git checkout -b codex/release-hotfix-<base-version>-r<rN>`

3. Implement minimal fix for the identified failure.

4. Validate locally:
- `make prepush-full`
- rerun the failing lane locally (release lane or UAT subset as applicable)

5. Commit and push all unstaged files:
- `git add -A`
- `git commit -m "hotfix: release stabilization for <base-version> (r<rN>)"`
- `git push -u origin <hotfix-branch>`

6. Open PR using EOF body:
- `gh pr create --title "hotfix: release stabilization <base-version> (r<rN>)" --body-file - <<'EOF'`
- include: problem, root cause, fix, validation
- `EOF`

7. Monitor PR CI (`ci` and `codeql`) to green (`CI_TIMEOUT_MIN`).
8. If PR CI is red and actionable, fix the full known actionable set on the same hotfix branch, rerun local validation, push again, and continue monitoring.

9. After PR CI is green, wait for required passive review/release gates as applicable; do not stop merely because those checks are still pending inside their timeout windows.

10. Merge PR after green and satisfied review gates.

11. Sync and monitor post-merge main CI:
- `git checkout main`
- `git pull --ff-only origin main`
- monitor `ci` and `codeql` on `main` (`CI_TIMEOUT_MIN`)
- if post-merge main CI is red and actionable, continue same loop (counts against max)
- if post-merge main CI is still running, continue polling until terminal or timeout; async wait alone is not a blocker

12. Bump patch version:
- `vX.Y.Z -> vX.Y.(Z+1)`

13. Create/push new tag from `main` and monitor `release` workflow again:
- tag from `main` only
- monitor until green (`RELEASE_TIMEOUT_MIN`)

14. Rerun full UAT for the new tag:
- `GAIT_UAT_RELEASE_VERSION=<new-version> bash scripts/test_uat_local.sh`

15. Exit conditions:
- if release + UAT green: success
- if loop count exceeds 2: stop with blocker report
- if non-actionable failure appears: stop with blocker report

### Global Wait Rule

- Pending GitHub Actions runs, pending passive review signals, pending merge propagation, and pending post-merge `main` checks are not blockers by themselves.
- While within the configured timeout windows, keep polling and continue the workflow.
- Only stop for:
- explicit failure classified as non-actionable or unsafe
- timeout expiry for the current wait window
- exhausted hotfix loop budget
- unexpected repo state that cannot be reconciled safely

## Command Contract (JSON Required)

Capture release diagnostics using `gait` commands with `--json`, for example:

- `gait doctor --json`
- `gait pack verify gait-out/pack_<id>.zip --json`

## EOF Rule (Mandatory)

All PR body/comment text must be provided with heredoc EOF.  
No inline multi-line `--body` strings.

## Expected Output

- Initial requested version and final shipped version
- All tags pushed (with confirmation each was cut from `main`)
- Release workflow run URL/status per tag
- UAT result per released tag
- Hotfix branch/PR URLs and commit SHAs (if any)
- Loop count used
- Final status: success or blocker with last failing gate
- If blocked, distinguish `hard blocker` from `async gate still in progress`; never report a mere in-progress async wait as the final blocker
