# Incident To Regression

Execute this workflow to transform an observed run into repeatable CI checks.

## Gait Context

Gait is the offline-first policy-as-code runtime for AI agent tool calls. It enforces tool-boundary policy, emits signed and verifiable evidence artifacts, and supports deterministic regressions.

Use this skill when:
- incident triage needs repeatable fixture creation
- CI gate failures require deterministic grader reruns
- receipt/evidence generation depends on regression outputs

Do not use this skill when:
- Gait CLI is unavailable in the environment
- no Gait run/pack artifact or run identifier is available as input

## Workflow

1. Resolve source run artifact:
   - use `<run_id>` or `<runpack_path>`
2. Initialize fixture deterministically (required):
   - explicit path: `gait capture --from <run_id_or_path> --json`
   - then `gait regress add --from ./gait-out/capture.json --json`
   - legacy fallback: `gait regress init --from <run_id_or_path> --json`
3. Parse and report:
   - `ok`, `run_id`, `fixture_name`, `fixture_dir`, `config_path`, `next_commands`
4. Run regression suite (required):
   - `gait regress run --json`
5. If CI output is requested, add JUnit:
   - `gait regress run --json --junit junit.xml`
6. Return concise summary:
   - source run
   - fixture path
   - pass/fail status
   - failed graders count
   - output paths

## Safety Rules

- Keep replay deterministic defaults.
- For replay workflows, prefer `gait run replay` (stub mode default); require explicit unsafe flags for real tool replay.
- Do not pass `--allow-nondeterministic` unless explicitly requested.
- Treat non-zero regress run exits as regressions, not soft warnings.
- Keep this skill wrapper-only: no inline grading logic and no policy-evaluator behavior outside CLI calls.

## Determinism Rules

- Always create a deterministic fixture before `regress run` for new incidents.
- Always consume `--json` output fields for decisions.
- Keep fixture names stable and explicit when user provides naming constraints.
