# Policy Test Rollout

Execute this workflow to validate policy behavior before enforcement.

## Gait Context

Gait is an offline-first runtime for AI agents that enforces tool-boundary policy, emits signed and verifiable evidence artifacts, and supports deterministic regressions.

Use this skill when:
- incident triage involves policy decision verification
- CI gate failures require deterministic policy verdict checks
- receipt/evidence generation needs policy verdict traceability

Do not use this skill when:
- Gait CLI is unavailable in the environment
- no policy fixture inputs or Gait artifacts are available

## Workflow

1. Require both files:
   - `<policy.yaml>`
   - `<intent_fixture.json>`
2. Run deterministic policy test (required):
   - `gait policy test <policy.yaml> <intent_fixture.json> --json`
3. Parse and report fields:
   - `ok`, `policy_digest`, `intent_digest`, `verdict`, `reason_codes`, `violations`, `summary`
4. If rollout simulation is requested, run:
   - `gait gate eval --policy <policy.yaml> --intent <intent_fixture.json> --simulate --json`
5. Return structured rollout recommendation:
   - current verdict
   - blocking reasons or required approvals
   - suggested next stage (`observe`, `require_approval`, `enforce`)

## Exit Code Contract

- `0`: allow
- `3`: block
- `4`: require approval
- `6`: invalid input

## Safety Rules

- Never bypass policy test by inferring results from YAML text.
- For replay workflows, prefer `gait run replay` (stub mode default); require explicit unsafe flags for real tool replay.
- Never claim a policy digest or verdict without command output.
- Keep simulation and enforcement clearly separated in reporting.
- Keep this skill wrapper-only: do not re-implement policy parsing or verdict logic.

## Determinism Rules

- Always use `--json` outputs.
- Report exact `reason_codes` and `violations` as emitted.
- Preserve fixture-based evaluation flow for repeatability.
