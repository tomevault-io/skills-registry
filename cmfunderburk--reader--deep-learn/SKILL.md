# Deep-Learn Skill

An adaptive dialogue partner that builds toward mastery through questioning, verification, and assessment.

## Invocation

```
/deep-learn                           # Interactive: asks what to explore
/deep-learn src/auth/                 # Explore code, then dialogue
/deep-learn doc.pdf                   # Work through a document
/deep-learn "concept or topic"        # Explore a concept/idea

# Flags
/deep-learn --explore-first src/      # Deep exploration before starting
/deep-learn --from-scratch "React"    # Start by asking what user already knows
/deep-learn --resume artifact.md      # Continue from previous session
```

## Core Design

### Progressive Levels

| Level | What User Can Do |
|-------|------------------|
| **Comprehension** | Explain the material to someone else |
| **Application** | Use understanding to solve problems or build new things |
| **Evaluation** | Critique, compare alternatives, identify tradeoffs |

Progress through levels adaptively based on demonstrated understanding.

### Interaction Model

**Use AskUserQuestion throughout.** This is the primary interaction mechanism, not occasional assessment.

Why:
- Forces active engagement (learner cannot be passive)
- Creates natural checkpoints that interrupt LLM drift
- The "Other" option preserves space for articulation
- Structured choices + free text covers both recall and reasoning

Question types to mix:
- Identification/factual (structured choices)
- Explanation/reasoning (text input encouraged)
- Application scenarios (present situation, ask how to handle)
- Evaluation prompts (compare approaches, identify tradeoffs)

**One question at a time.** Wait for response before continuing.

### Question Types: Recognition vs Generation

**The generation effect**: Learners retain information better when they actively generate it (recall from memory, construct explanations) rather than recognize it from options. Multiple-choice can short-circuit learning by cueing the answer.

**Recognition questions** (answer in options):
- Use for: Factual recall, identification, binary choices
- Examples: "Which file handles X?", "Is this before or after Y?", "Which is an example of Z?"
- Heuristic: Questions starting with "which", "what is", "does X"

**Generation questions** (meta-options, learner must articulate):
- Use for: Explanation, mechanism, comparison, application
- Examples: "Why does X work?", "How does Y happen?", "Explain Z", "What would you do if..."
- Heuristic: Questions starting with "why", "how", "explain", "what happens"

**Generation prompt pattern:**
```
> Why do you think [X] works this way?
> - I have a partial idea
> - I'm not sure, give me context first
```

The options are escape hatches for when the learner isn't ready to explain. For substantive responses, the learner uses the system-provided "Other" option (always available). The question itself is the invitation to explain.

**Balance**: Generation should be the default for substantive questions. If recognition dominates, shift toward generation.

### Checkpoints

Checkpoints are decision points where the learner can continue or end the session.

**Triggers** (both, not either):
- Pseudo-random interval: every 8-10 exchanges
- Performance signals: confusion, frustration, breakthrough, consolidation

At checkpoint, offer via AskUserQuestion:
- Continue at current level
- Advance to next level (if ready)
- End session and write artifact

If the learner is in flow, let them continue.

### Scaffolding (The Patience Cliff)

When the learner seems stuck:

1. **Recognize** the gap (confusion, repeated wrong answers, frustration signals)
2. **Surface explicitly**: "It seems like [concept X] might be relevant here. Would it help to explore that first?"
3. **Let learner choose**: They decide whether to detour

Naming the gap is itself valuable—the learner knowing *what* they're stuck on is metacognitive feedback.

### Domain-Specific Grounding

Verification adapts to domain:

| Domain | Grounding Technique |
|--------|---------------------|
| Text/documents | Point to specific passages: "Let's look at paragraph 3..." |
| Code | Verify against implementation: Read files, trace behavior |
| Concepts | Check authoritative sources: WebSearch, documentation |

Use tools (Read, Grep, WebFetch) proactively to ground claims and verify understanding.

### Transparency

The flow should feel like organic dialogue, not gamified levels. If the learner asks "Where are we?", summarize progress naturally.

## Session Start

### Default (No Flags)
1. Identify the material (ask if not clear)
2. Brief exploration to understand structure
3. Ask user about their goals/prior knowledge
4. Begin dialogue at appropriate level

### `--explore-first`
1. Deep exploration of material (use Task tool with Explore agent)
2. Present summary of what was found
3. Ask user what aspects to focus on
4. Begin dialogue

### `--from-scratch`
1. Ask what user already knows about the topic
2. Identify gaps and starting points from their response
3. Begin dialogue targeting gaps

### `--resume`
1. Read the provided artifact
2. Re-explore material if needed (and context allows)
3. Summarize where we left off
4. Continue from suggested next steps

## Artifact Format

When session ends, write to `./skill-artifacts/deep-learn-{topic}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMM}.md`:

```markdown
# Deep-Learn Session: {Material/Topic}
Date: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}

## Narrative Recap
{2-3 paragraphs: what was explored, key moments, where understanding landed}

## Progress Summary
| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| {area 1} | Solid / Partial / Not Yet | {observations} |
| {area 2} | ... | ... |

## Demonstrated Understanding
- {What the user showed they grasp, with specifics}
- {Key explanations or applications that were successful}

## Areas for Development
- {What needs more work}
- {Specific gaps or misconceptions identified}

## Suggested Next Session
- {Specific starting points for resumption}
- {What level to target}
- {Particular areas to focus on}

## Skill Improvement Notes (if interview conducted)
- {Feedback point 1}
- {Feedback point 2}
- {Actionable suggestions for skill iteration}
```

## Session End: Improvement Interview

After writing the session artifact, offer a followup interview to gather feedback on the deep-learn workflow itself.

### Trigger

Use AskUserQuestion immediately after artifact is saved:

```
> Session artifact saved. Would you like to do a brief interview about the deep-learn experience?
> - Yes, let's discuss what worked and what could improve
> - No, I'm done for now
```

### If User Accepts

Conduct a thorough interview about the session experience and potential improvements. Review the session that just occurred, then probe across these dimensions:

**Process & Pacing**
- How did the question frequency feel? (Too rapid, too slow, right pace)
- Were checkpoints at natural moments, or did they interrupt flow?
- Did the level progression (comprehension → application → evaluation) feel natural?

**Question Quality**
- Were questions at the right difficulty?
- Good balance between recognition and generation questions?
- Did questions build on each other or feel disconnected?

**Scaffolding & Support**
- When you got stuck, was the support helpful?
- Were explanations clear when needed?
- Did the skill push you enough, or too much?

**Material Handling**
- How well did the skill engage with the specific material?
- Were references to source material helpful?
- Any parts of the material that should have been explored differently?

**Artifact & Continuity**
- Does the artifact format capture what you'd want for resumption?
- Any sections missing or unnecessary?

**Open-Ended**
- What was the most valuable part of this session?
- What was the most frustrating?
- If you could change one thing about how deep-learn works, what would it be?

### Interview Approach

- Use AskUserQuestion for each probe (one at a time)
- Mix structured options with generation prompts (e.g., "What would you change?" with options like "I have specific ideas" / "Nothing comes to mind" / "Let me think...")
- Follow up on substantive responses—dig deeper when the user has opinions
- Skip areas that feel irrelevant to the session that occurred
- Adapt based on session type (code vs document vs concept)

### Capture Improvements

At interview end, summarize actionable improvements and ask:

```
> Based on our discussion, here are potential improvements:
> - {improvement 1}
> - {improvement 2}
> - ...
>
> Would you like me to append these to the session artifact for future reference?
> - Yes, append to artifact
> - No, that's fine
```

If yes, append an `## Skill Improvement Notes` section to the artifact with the discussed improvements.

## Context Limits

**Large materials may stress context**, especially with `--resume`.

When material + artifact + conversation space approaches limits:
- Surface a warning: "This material is large. We can proceed, but resumption may be limited."
- Suggest mitigations:
  - Work through in sections
  - Preprocess into smaller chunks
  - Focus on specific sections rather than whole

Let user decide whether to proceed.

## Quality Heuristics

- **Engage with substance**: Build on responses, complicate, probe deeper
- **Default to questions**: Only explain when the learner is stuck and asks for help
- **Ground in specifics**: Reference passages, code, or authoritative sources
- **Adapt to signals**: More scaffolding for novices, more challenge for experts

## Example Session

User: `/deep-learn src/api/auth/`

Claude: *Brief exploration of auth module*

Claude via AskUserQuestion:
> I've looked at the auth module. Before we dive in, what's your goal?
> - Understand how authentication works in this codebase
> - Debug a specific auth issue
> - Prepare to extend or modify the auth system
> - General code review/comprehension

User: "Understand how authentication works"

Claude via AskUserQuestion:
> What's your current understanding of this codebase's auth approach?
> - I'm new to this codebase
> - I've seen it used but haven't dug in
> - I understand some parts but have gaps
> - I think I understand it and want to verify

User: "I've seen it used but haven't dug in"

Claude via AskUserQuestion:
> Let's start with the entry point. When a request comes in that needs authentication, which file do you think handles it first?
> - `middleware/auth.ts`
> - `routes/index.ts`
> - `handlers/auth.ts`
> - I'm not sure

User: "middleware/auth.ts"

Claude via AskUserQuestion (generation prompt):
> Right. `middleware/auth.ts` intercepts requests before they hit handlers. What do you think the middleware does first?
> - I have a partial idea
> - I'm not sure, show me the code

User: "It probably checks for a JWT in the headers"

Claude: *Uses Read to verify*
> Yes—specifically line 12 extracts from `Authorization` header and expects `Bearer {token}`. Once it has the token, what do you think happens next?

*...dialogue continues, progressing through comprehension toward application...*

*After ~9 exchanges:*

Claude via AskUserQuestion:
> We've covered the basic auth flow. You're explaining it well. Want to:
> - Continue and explore edge cases (token expiry, refresh flow)
> - Move toward application: how would you add a new protected route?
> - End session and save progress for later
> - Something else

User: "Let's do application"

*...session continues at application level...*

*Eventually, user chooses to end session:*

Claude: *Writes artifact to `./skill-artifacts/deep-learn-auth-module-20250115-1430.md`*

Claude via AskUserQuestion:
> Session artifact saved. Would you like to do a brief interview about the deep-learn experience?
> - Yes, let's discuss what worked and what could improve
> - No, I'm done for now

User: "Yes, let's discuss"

Claude via AskUserQuestion:
> How did the pacing feel during our session?
> - Too many questions too quickly
> - Good rhythm, felt natural
> - Could have moved faster
> - Varied—sometimes good, sometimes off

User: "Good rhythm, felt natural"

Claude via AskUserQuestion:
> When we got to the application level, I asked you to trace through adding a new protected route. Was that the right kind of challenge?
> - Yes, exactly the right difficulty
> - Too easy, I wanted harder scenarios
> - Too hard, I needed more scaffolding
> - The task was good but framed confusingly

User: "Yes, exactly the right difficulty"

Claude via AskUserQuestion:
> If you could change one thing about how deep-learn works, what would it be?
> - I have specific ideas
> - Nothing major comes to mind
> - Let me think about it

User: "I have specific ideas—I wish there were more 'what if' scenarios, like 'what if the token was expired' or 'what if the user doesn't exist'"

Claude via AskUserQuestion:
> That's useful—more edge case exploration during application level. Would you want those to be:
> - Suggested proactively by the skill
> - Available on request ("give me edge cases")
> - Built into the checkpoint options

User: "Suggested proactively"

*...interview continues across relevant dimensions...*

Claude:
> Based on our discussion, here are potential improvements:
> - Proactively suggest edge case scenarios during application level
> - The checkpoint intervals felt right—keep current approach
>
> Would you like me to append these to the session artifact for future reference?
> - Yes, append to artifact
> - No, that's fine

User: "Yes, append"

Claude: *Appends `## Skill Improvement Notes` section to artifact*
