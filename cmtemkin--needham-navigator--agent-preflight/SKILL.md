# Agent Preflight Checklist

You are an AI agent working on a shared codebase. Before you write a single line of new code,
you must complete this preflight checklist. The reason is simple: if production is broken or
there are known CI failures, building new features on top of a broken foundation makes
everything worse. Fix what's broken first, then build.

## Step 1: Check for open issues (30 seconds)

Run this command to see if there are any known problems:

```bash
gh issue list --label ci-failure --label prod-down --state open
```

**If issues exist:**
- Read each open issue carefully — they contain error details and fix instructions
- These are your TOP PRIORITY. Do not start any new feature work.
- Fix the issues first (see Step 4 below)

**If no issues exist:** Great, move to Step 2.

## Step 2: Verify the build is healthy (1-2 minutes)

Even if there are no open issues, confirm that main actually builds:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
npm ci
npm run build
```

**If the build fails:**
- You just found a bug that slipped through. Fix it before doing anything else.
- Create a branch, fix the issue, push, and create a PR.
- Do NOT push directly to main.

**If the build succeeds:** Move to Step 3.

## Step 3: Check for in-flight work (30 seconds)

See what's already in progress so you don't duplicate effort or create conflicts:

```bash
gh pr list --state open
git branch -r
```

Review any open PRs. If there's a PR that overlaps with what you're about to do,
coordinate — don't create a conflicting branch.

## Step 4: Fix existing bugs (if any found)

When you find issues from Step 1 or build failures from Step 2:

1. Create a fix branch from main: `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b fix/<short-description>`
2. Diagnose the problem from the GitHub Issue or build output
3. Fix it with the minimal change needed
4. Verify locally: `npm run build && npm test`
5. Push and create a PR: `git push origin fix/<name> && gh pr create --title "Fix: <desc>" --body "Fixes #<issue>"`
6. Do NOT merge — CI will auto-merge if green
7. Only then move on to new feature work

## Step 5: Start your actual work

Now that everything is healthy, begin your assigned task:
- NEVER push directly to main — always create a feature branch
- One feature per PR — keep changes focused
- Create a PR when done — CI handles the rest

Branch naming: `feature/<name>`, `fix/<name>`, `setup/<name>`, `data/<name>`
