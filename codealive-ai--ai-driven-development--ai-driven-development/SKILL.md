# First Principles Framework (FPF)

An "Operating System for Thought" — a transdisciplinary architecture for reasoning,
written in human- and machine-readable pseudo-code. FPF turns raw intelligence (human or machine)
into organisationally usable reasoning: explicit bounded contexts, auditable artefacts, multi-view
descriptions, and disciplined hand-offs between specialised actors.

## Use cases

Use FPF whenever you need to think more rigorously than the situation's default.

- Decompose a messy, cross-domain problem into parts that can be reasoned about independently
- Make a high-stakes decision with incomplete evidence — and know what evidence is still missing
- Get a mixed team to reason together without vocabulary collisions or hidden assumptions
- Audit whether a conclusion is well-founded or just plausible
- Transfer an insight across domains without losing precision or introducing category errors
- Structure a proposal that must survive scrutiny from multiple expert perspectives
- Generate alternatives systematically instead of anchoring on the first idea
- Define what "better" means before comparing options
- Classify what kind of problem you're facing before searching for solutions
- Plan how an AI agent should select and sequence its tools under budget and trust constraints
- Make a decision under uncertainty — identify options, weigh evidence, and commit with an auditable rationale
- Establish whether X causes Y — or just correlates — and determine what intervention would work
- Publish a stable multi-view artifact without changing the source semantics
- Refresh a SoTA pack, benchmark, or evidence trail when evidence decays or telemetry changes

## How to navigate

The use cases above help decide WHETHER to invoke FPF. The router below decides WHERE to go once invoked.

For complex problems, follow paths across multiple sections — the router shows where to start, not where to stop.

### Step 2 — Read the _index.md, then the sub-section

1. Open the `_index.md` of the target section folder — it lists all sub-sections with line counts and descriptions.
2. Read only the specific sub-section file you need.
3. Do NOT load entire sections. Pick the narrowest file that serves the user's question.

### Step 3 — Apply in plain language

Use plain language for the user. Introduce FPF-internal names (U.Holon, Gamma, F-G-R)
only when they add precision the user needs.

### Step 4 — Compose findings across sections

When a problem draws from multiple sections:

1. State each pattern's contribution in one line (e.g., "Bounded Contexts gives us the parts; Trust Calculus scores our confidence in each").
2. If patterns from different sections appear to conflict, check for category errors via A.7 Strict Distinction — the conflict is usually a level confusion (role vs. function, method vs. work), not a real contradiction.
3. Synthesize in natural order: decomposition first (what are the parts?), then evaluation (how confident are we?), then resolution (what do we do about gaps?).
4. Do not just list FPF patterns — weave them into a coherent answer to the user's actual question.

## Starter prompt (example — adapt to the user's actual role and need)

> You have the FPF specification loaded.
> Help me structure my project / problem / programme.
> Use plain language for an engineer-manager.
> Propose: (1) bounded contexts / specialisations, (2) decision criteria, (3) key alternatives,
> (4) hand-offs, and (5) missing evidence or tests before commitment.
> Introduce internal FPF names only when they add precision.

## Section INDEX

Structural reference. Each entry is a folder — read its `_index.md` first, then pick the sub-section.
