# Apex to Action

## What This Is

A execution planner that takes battle-tested output from food-chain-ideation and converts it into a 90-day plan with validation gates, weekly milestones, and a kill list.

## What This Is Not

- Not a project management tool. No Gantt charts, no sprint planning, no resource allocation.
- Not a generic business plan generator. It only works on ideas that survived a food chain battle.
- Not a replacement for judgment. It gives you structure, not answers.

## Input Requirements

**Minimum required:** Evolved Idea + Unfair Advantage Statement.

**Strongly preferred:** Full Battle Log block from food chain output (includes fallen animals, patches applied, killed features).

If the user does not have battle output, respond:

> You need a battle-tested idea first. Run `/food-chain-ideation` with your raw idea, then come back with the output. This skill only works on ideas that survived the food chain.

If the user pastes a Battle Log, parse every field: original idea, evolved idea, apex predator, patches, fallen animals, killed features, unfair advantage.

## Step 1 — Battle Debrief

Parse the battle output and produce:

```markdown
## Battle Debrief

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Original idea** | [extracted from battle output] |
| **Evolved idea** | [extracted — this is what we're planning for] |
| **Apex predator** | [what survived and why it won] |
| **Key patches applied** | [list of adaptations made during battle] |
| **Killed features** | [features that lost every round — these go on the kill list] |
| **Unfair advantage** | [extracted — this drives Phase 2 build priority] |
```

Extract killed features from fallen animals' insights. Each fallen animal likely attacked a weakness — the patches that stuck are strengths, the features that kept failing are dead.

## Step 2 — Validation Gates

Things that must be proven TRUE before writing any code. Each gate is a specific, binary test.

```markdown
## Validation Gates — prove these before writing code

| Gate | Test | Pass if | Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [specific test] | [measurable criterion] | [how to run the test] |
| 2 | [specific test] | [measurable criterion] | [how to run the test] |
| 3 | [specific test] | [measurable criterion] | [how to run the test] |
```

Rules:
- Maximum 5 gates.
- Each gate must be completable in under 2 weeks.
- Each gate must have a binary pass/fail — no "it depends."
- Gates are ordered: gate 1 failure kills the project, gate 5 failure adjusts scope.
- Methods must be concrete: "interview 10 users" not "do market research."

## Step 3 — The 90-Day Plan

Three phases. Each ends with a decision gate that determines whether to continue.

```markdown
### Phase 1: Validate (Days 1-30)

| Week | Action |
|---|---|
| 1-2 | [specific validation activity tied to Gates 1-2] |
| 3-4 | [specific validation activity tied to Gates 3-5] |

**Decision gate:** [what must be true to proceed to Phase 2]

### Phase 2: Build Core (Days 31-60)

| Week | Action |
|---|---|
| 5-6 | [build the ONE feature that proves the unfair advantage — nothing else] |
| 7-8 | [ship to real users, iterate based on actual usage data] |

**Decision gate:** [what must be true to proceed to Phase 3]

### Phase 3: Expand (Days 61-90)

| Week | Action |
|---|---|
| 9-10 | [second feature, chosen based on Phase 2 usage data] |
| 11-12 | [one distribution or growth experiment] |

**Decision gate:** [what must be true to continue investing past 90 days]
```

Rules:
- Phase 2 builds exactly ONE feature. The one most connected to the unfair advantage.
- Phase 3 second feature is informed by real data from Phase 2, not assumptions.
- Each decision gate is pass/fail. Failing means pivot, not push through.
- Weekly items are actions, not goals. "Run 15 customer interviews" not "understand the market."

## Step 4 — Kill List

Features that must never be built. Sourced from battle output.

```markdown
## Never Build

| Feature | Killed by | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| [feature] | [animal in battle] | [one line from battle insight] |
| [feature] | — | no structural advantage, would dilute unfair advantage |
| [feature] | — | user asked about it but battle proved it unnecessary |
```

Rules:
- Every killed feature needs a reason traced back to the battle.
- If the user later asks to build a killed feature, reference this list and require a new battle to justify it.

## Step 5 — Action Log

Compressed block the user can paste into future sessions to resume planning.

```markdown
## Action Log

Copy this block into future sessions to resume planning.

> **Date:** [date]
> **Battle date:** [battle date if available]
> **Phase:** [1/2/3] | **Status:** [NOT STARTED / IN PROGRESS / GATE PASSED / BLOCKED]
> **Completed:** [what's done]
> **Blocked on:** [what's stuck, if anything]
> **Next:** [the single immediate next action]
```

When a user pastes an Action Log back, pick up from where they left off. Update the phase, check gate status, and give the next concrete action.

## Calibration

**Strong battle output** (full Battle Log, multiple rounds, clear apex predator):
- Tight validation gates with specific metrics.
- Phase 2 feature is precisely scoped from the unfair advantage.
- Kill list is comprehensive.

**Weak battle output** (only Evolved Idea + Unfair Advantage, no Battle Log):
- Wider validation gates — more unknowns to test.
- Phase 1 gets extra emphasis, possibly 5 full gates instead of 3.
- Kill list is shorter, marked as provisional.

**Battle killed the idea** (no apex predator survived):
- Do not generate a 90-day plan.
- Respond: "This idea didn't survive the food chain. Run `/food-chain-ideation` with a pivot — the fallen animals' insights tell you what to change."
- If pivot engine output exists, reference it instead.

## Output Format

Always output in this order:
1. Battle Debrief
2. Validation Gates
3. 90-Day Plan (three phases)
4. Kill List
5. Action Log

No preamble. No disclaimers. Start with `BATTLE DEBRIEF` immediately after parsing input.

Every line in the output is something the user can act on today.
