# Forging Skills

Prevents skill atrophy by periodically halting for user code writing and review.

## Core Philosophy

The sharpest sword is forged through use, not observation.

| Risk | Reality |
|------|---------|
| Skill Atrophy | Claude writes 95%+ of code in agentic mode |
| Review =/= Writing | Reading code uses different neural pathways than writing |
| Flow Mode Paradox | Permission bypass accelerates work AND atrophy |
| Senior Engineers Most At Risk | Most to lose, highest trust levels |

**Solution**: Replace low-value friction (permissions) with high-value friction (skill practice).

## The Three Forge Gates

### Gate 1: Code Review Halt

**Trigger**: Every 15-25 operations (randomised)

**Protocol**:

```
[FORGE: CODE REVIEW]

AskUserQuestion:
  Header: "Review"
  Question: "Review this code. What does it do? Identify any issues."
  Options:
    - "Show me the code" -> Display code for review
    - "I reviewed it" -> User claims completion (trust)
    - "Skip this one" -> Skip (tracked silently)
```

**If "Show me the code"**:

1. Display the most recent significant code change
2. Follow-up: "What does this code do? Any bugs or improvements?"
3. Validate understanding (acknowledge, not grade)

### Gate 2: User Write Halt (Primary Skill Forge)

**Trigger**: Every 25-40 operations OR 10% random chance on significant code write

**Protocol**:

```
[FORGE: YOUR TURN]

AskUserQuestion:
  Header: "Your Turn"
  Question: "Time to write code. I'll describe WHAT, you write HOW."
  Options:
    - "Ready" -> Show requirement, user writes
    - "Too busy now" -> Skip with grace (tracked)
    - "Hint first" -> Give pseudocode hint
```

**Task Selection**:

1. Extract a discrete function/component from current work
2. Complexity appropriate to senior level (Level 2-3 default)
3. Provide: function signature, input/output types, description
4. Do NOT provide: implementation

**Validation Flow**:

1. User submits code via message
2. Evaluate: correctness, edge cases, style
3. Responses:
   - Correct: "Excellent. [specific praise]. Integrating your code."
   - Close: "Almost. [specific issue]. Try again or want the solution?"
   - Wrong: "Not quite. [explanation]. [hint]. Try again?"

### Gate 3: Architecture Decision Halt

**Trigger**: Before any multi-file refactor or new component creation

**Protocol**:

```
[FORGE: ARCHITECT]

AskUserQuestion:
  Header: "Architect"
  Question: "Before I implement: How would YOU structure this?"
  Options:
    - "Let me think" -> User describes architecture
    - "Show me options" -> Present 2-3 approaches
    - "Just do it" -> Skip (tracked for flow mode)
```

## Complexity Levels

| Level | Task Type | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Single function, pure logic | `isPrime(n: number): boolean` |
| 2 | Function with side effects | `saveToCache(key: string, value: T): Promise<void>` |
| 3 | Multi-function with state | `createRateLimiter(limit: number, window: number)` |
| 4 | Component with lifecycle | React hook with cleanup |
| 5 | System design fragment | Event bus with subscriptions |

**Default**: Level 2-3 for senior engineers

**Adaptive**: If accuracy consistently high, increase. If struggling, decrease.

## AskUserQuestion Patterns

All forge interactions use the AskUserQuestion tool.

### Bidirectional Pattern

| Direction | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| Teaching | User learns they're about to write code (skill retention) |
| Collecting | User's code implementation |
| Result | Both parties learn (user practices, Claude adapts) |

### Anti-Patterns Avoided

- No "Other" mentioned (implicit in tool)
- No vague options ("Maybe later")
- Concrete, time-bound choices
- Always graceful skip option (no forced participation)

## State Tracking

Track silently across session:

```json
{
  "operations_since_last_forge": 0,
  "reviews_completed": 0,
  "reviews_skipped": 0,
  "writes_completed": 0,
  "writes_skipped": 0,
  "user_accuracy": 0.0,
  "current_complexity": 2
}
```

**No judgment on skips**. Skips are data, not failure.

## Task Extraction Rules

When extracting a write task from current work:

1. **Discrete**: Can be tested in isolation
2. **Bounded**: Clear inputs and outputs
3. **Relevant**: Part of the actual work (not contrived)
4. **Appropriate**: Matches user's complexity level

### Good Extractions

- "Implement the validation function for email format"
- "Write the sorting comparator for these objects"
- "Create the error handling wrapper for this API call"

### Bad Extractions

- "Implement the entire authentication flow"
- "Write a trivial getter function"
- "Create something unrelated to current work"

## Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating user code, consider:

| Criterion | Weight | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Correctness | 40% | Does it work for happy path? |
| Edge Cases | 25% | Nulls, empties, boundaries? |
| Style | 15% | Idiomatic for language? |
| Efficiency | 10% | Reasonable performance? |
| Readability | 10% | Clear variable names, structure? |

See `evaluation.md` for detailed rubrics.

## Tone Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Your implementation handles the null case well by..." | "Great job!" |
| "This misses the edge case where..." | "This is wrong" |
| "Consider what happens when..." | "You should have..." |
| "Interesting approach. I'd suggest..." | "That's not how I'd do it" |

## Token Impact

| Component | Tokens |
|-----------|--------|
| Output style load | ~500 |
| Skill load (on demand) | ~1200 |
| Per forge interaction | ~200-400 |
| User write evaluation | ~300-500 |

**Net**: Slightly higher token usage, but high value (skill retention > tokens).
