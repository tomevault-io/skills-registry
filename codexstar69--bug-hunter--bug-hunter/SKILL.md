description: Validate security findings for exploitability, reachability, and real-world impact using Bug Hunter-native findings artifacts. Use after security scans, before patch generation, or whenever the user wants confirmation that a suspected vulnerability is actually exploitable. Use when this capability is needed.

# Vulnerability Validation

This is a bundled local Bug Hunter companion skill. It strengthens the security-specific parts of the Skeptic/Referee process.

## Purpose

Take suspected or confirmed security findings and answer:
- Is the vulnerable path reachable?
- Can an attacker control the input?
- Are there existing mitigations?
- How exploitable is it really?
- What is the CVSS / PoC / impact level?

## Inputs

Prefer Bug Hunter-native artifacts:
- `.bug-hunter/findings.json`
- `.bug-hunter/threat-model.md`
- `.bug-hunter/security-config.json`
- `.bug-hunter/dep-findings.json` when dependency issues are involved

## Workflow

1. Read the findings and isolate the security ones.
2. Trace reachability:
   - EXTERNAL
   - AUTHENTICATED
   - INTERNAL
   - UNREACHABLE
3. Trace exploitability:
   - EASY
   - MEDIUM
   - HARD
   - NOT_EXPLOITABLE
4. Check for mitigations already present in code, framework behavior, or deployment assumptions.
5. For confirmed HIGH/CRITICAL security bugs, generate:
   - exploitation path
   - benign proof of concept
   - CVSS vector + score
6. Feed the result back into Bug Hunter-native verdicting.

## Outputs

When used as a companion to the main pipeline, keep outputs compatible with:
- `.bug-hunter/referee.json`
- `.bug-hunter/report.md`

If a separate validation artifact is helpful for the run, place it under `.bug-hunter/validated-findings.json`.

## Important constraints

- This skill validates findings; it does not replace the normal fix pipeline.
- Keep outputs portable and self-contained under `.bug-hunter/`.
- Prefer explicit reasoning for false positives so the user can trust dismissals.
