# Islamic Content Authenticity

Use this skill when adding or reviewing **Quran quotes**, **hadith**, **Arabic terms**, or **translations** in TryRamadan. Always verify against canonical sources before committing.

---

## 1. Quran quotes and fact-checking

### Canonical reference
- **Standard text**: Uthmani script; verse numbering follows the standard 6236-verse (or 6235 by some counts) Mushaf.
- **Fasting verses**: Surah Al-Baqarah 2:183–187 are the primary fasting verses. Any claim about “what the Quran says about fasting” must align with these and not contradict them.

### Verification steps
1. **Verse reference** – Confirm surah number (1–114), verse number, and that the verse exists (e.g. Al-Baqarah has 286 verses).
2. **Wording** – If displaying a quote, cross-check the English (and Arabic if shown) against a trusted source (e.g. [Quran.com](https://quran.com), api.quran.com). Prefer Saheeh International (translation id 20) for consistency with the app.
3. **Fact-checking** – When making a claim “the Quran says X”:
   - Identify the exact verse(s) that support it.
   - Ensure no conflation with hadith or tafsir; label clearly (“Quran”, “hadith”, “scholarly explanation”).
4. **In-app usage** – Quran text in the app comes from `api.quran.com` (DashboardQuran). For static copy (e.g. fasting rules, tooltips), cite verse (e.g. “2:185”) and keep wording close to a standard translation.

### Red flags
- Verse reference that doesn’t exist (e.g. 2:300).
- Paraphrase presented as a direct quote without “based on” or “cf.”.
- Mixing Quran and hadith without labelling.

## 2. Hadith authenticity

### Sources used in TryRamadan
- **Sahih al-Bukhari** – Highest regard in Sunni Islam; cite by book/number (e.g. Sahih al-Bukhari 1899).
- **Sahih Muslim** – Same tier; cite by number (e.g. Sahih Muslim 1162).
- **Sunan al-Tirmidhi** – Often has grading in the source (e.g. “hasan sahih”).
- **Sunan Abi Dawud**, **Sunan an-Nasa’i**, **Muwatta Malik** – Sometimes referenced; include full source.

### Verification steps
1. **Source string** – Must include collection name and number (e.g. `Sahih al-Bukhari 1904`). No bare “Bukhari” or “Muslim” without number.
2. **Cross-check** – Look up the number on [Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com) (Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, etc.) and confirm:
   - The Arabic/English text matches the intended meaning.
   - The hadith is about the topic we claim (e.g. fasting, suhoor, Laylat al-Qadr).
3. **Grading** – Prefer hadiths that are **sahih** or **hasan**. If using da’if or less common collections, note in context or avoid in prominent UI.
4. **Data file** – Hadiths live in `src/data/hadiths.json`. Each entry must have `source` (e.g. "Sahih al-Bukhari 1923"), `text` (English), `topic`, and optional `context`. Do not invent or paraphrase hadith; keep wording close to a standard translation and cite accurately.

### Red flags
- Wrong book number (e.g. Bukhari 38 for a suhoor hadith that is actually 1923).
- Quote that doesn’t appear in the cited source.
- Fabricated or weak hadith presented as “the Prophet said” without qualification.

## 3. Arabic translations and glossary

### Where Arabic appears
- **Glossary** – `src/data/glossary.json`: `term`, `arabic`, `pronunciation` or `transliteration`, `definition`, optional `definitionAr`.
- **Tooltips** – `src/data/eating-times-tooltips.ts`, `src/data/general-tooltips.ts`: some entries have `bodyAr` or Arabic text.
- **UI / cultural data** – `src/data/cultural-traditions.json`, labels, and other JSON: `arabic`, `arabicName`, or inline Arabic.

### Verification steps
1. **Correct script** – Arabic must be in proper Arabic script (no Latin letters in place of Arabic). Use Unicode; ensure direction is `dir="rtl"` where displayed.
2. **Term match** – Arabic word/phrase must match the English term (e.g. سحور for Suhoor, إفطار for Iftar). Cross-check with a standard dictionary or glossary (e.g. Wehr, or Quran.com glossary).
3. **Transliteration** – Use consistent scheme (e.g. IAST-style for Islamic terms: ḍ, ṣ, ṭ, ḥ, etc.). Match existing style in `glossary.json` and tooltips.
4. **definitionAr** – If provided, must be a correct Arabic explanation or equivalent of the English definition, not a mistranslation or unrelated phrase.

### Red flags
- Wrong diacritics or typo in Arabic (changes meaning).
- Reversed or mismatched term/translation (e.g. Arabic for “Iftar” next to “Suhoor”).
- Transliteration that misrepresents pronunciation (e.g. “Suhoor” vs “Suhur” – app uses “Suhoor”; keep consistency).

## 4. Quick checklist before committing

- [ ] **Quran**: Verse refs valid; wording matches a standard translation; no claim attributed to Quran that isn’t in the verse(s).
- [ ] **Hadith**: Source string with collection + number; looked up on Sunnah.com; meaning matches usage; grading acceptable.
- [ ] **Arabic**: Script correct; term–translation match; transliteration consistent; RTL where needed.
- [ ] **Labels**: “Quran” vs “hadith” vs “scholarly view” clearly distinguished in UI and copy.

## 5. References

| Resource | Use |
|----------|-----|
| [Quran.com](https://quran.com) / [api.quran.com](https://api.quran.com) | Verse text, chapter/verse bounds, translations (e.g. Saheeh International). |
| [Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com) | Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, etc.; verify hadith number and text. |
| App config | `src/lib/config.ts`: `EXTERNAL_LINKS.quran`, `EXTERNAL_LINKS.sunnah`; `API_CONFIG.quranApi`. |
| App data | `src/data/hadiths.json`, `src/data/glossary.json`, `src/data/ramadan-info.json`, `src/data/eating-times-tooltips.ts`, `src/data/general-tooltips.ts`. |

When in doubt, prefer **not** adding a quote or hadith until it is verified. Prefer citing a verse or source and linking to Quran.com or Sunnah.com rather than inlining unverified text.
