# GitHub Repository Setup Skill

You are helping set up GitHub integration for a SentryVibe project. This skill uses the `gh` CLI tool which authenticates locally on the user's machine.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: You MUST Output GITHUB_RESULT

**YOUR RESPONSE IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT THIS LINE.**

After completing the GitHub setup, your FINAL message MUST include this exact line (with real values):

```
GITHUB_RESULT:{"success":true,"repo":"owner/repo-name","url":"https://github.com/owner/repo-name","branch":"main","action":"setup"}
```

This line:
- Must be on its own line
- Must start with `GITHUB_RESULT:` (no spaces before)
- Must contain valid JSON with actual repo info
- Must appear in your final response text

**If you don't output this line, the UI will not update to show the connected repository.**

### Result Schema

```typescript
{
  success: boolean;        // Whether the operation succeeded
  repo?: string;           // Repository in "owner/repo" format
  url?: string;            // Full GitHub URL
  branch?: string;         // Default branch name (usually "main")
  action: "setup" | "push" | "sync" | "error";  // What action was performed
  error?: string;          // Error message if success is false
  filesChanged?: number;   // For push operations
  commitSha?: string;      // For push operations
}
```

## Prerequisites Check

Before creating a repository, verify the environment:

1. **Check gh CLI is installed:**
   ```bash
   gh --version
   ```
   If not installed, return error result:
   ```json
   GITHUB_RESULT:{"success":false,"action":"error","error":"gh CLI not installed. Install with: brew install gh (macOS) or sudo apt install gh (Linux)"}
   ```

2. **Check authentication status:**
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```
   If not authenticated, return error result:
   ```json
   GITHUB_RESULT:{"success":false,"action":"error","error":"Not authenticated with GitHub. Run: gh auth login"}
   ```

## Repository Creation Flow

When the user wants to set up GitHub for their project:

1. **Initialize git if needed:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Update the README.md:**
   Before creating the initial commit, update the project's README.md with relevant information:
   - Project name and brief description
   - Tech stack / framework used
   - Basic setup instructions (npm install, npm run dev, etc.)
   - Any other relevant project details
   
   If README.md doesn't exist, create one. Keep it concise but informative.

3. **Create initial commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit from SentryVibe"
   ```

4. **Create the GitHub repository and push:**
   
   Check the user's request to determine visibility:
   - If they say "public repository" → use `--public`
   - If they say "private repository" → use `--private`
   - Default to `--public` if not specified
   
   ```bash
   # For public repository:
   gh repo create {project-name} --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
   
   # For private repository:
   gh repo create {project-name} --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
   ```
   
   Use the project name (slugified) as the repository name.

5. **Get repository information (including default branch):**
   ```bash
   gh repo view --json url,name,owner,defaultBranchRef
   ```

6. **Verify the default branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

7. **Return structured result:**
   ```json
   GITHUB_RESULT:{"success":true,"repo":"username/project-name","url":"https://github.com/username/project-name","branch":"main","action":"setup"}
   ```

## Push Changes Flow

When the user wants to push changes to an existing repository:

1. **Stage and commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update from SentryVibe"
   ```

2. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Get the commit info:**
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --short HEAD
   ```

4. **Return structured result:**
   ```json
   GITHUB_RESULT:{"success":true,"action":"push","commitSha":"abc1234","filesChanged":5}
   ```

## Error Handling

Always return a structured error result:

```json
GITHUB_RESULT:{"success":false,"action":"error","error":"Description of what went wrong"}
```

Common errors to handle:
- **gh CLI not installed:** Provide installation instructions
- **Not authenticated:** Guide them through `gh auth login`
- **Repository name taken:** Suggest adding a suffix
- **No internet connection:** Inform them to check their connection
- **Permission denied:** Check write access

## Security Notes

- Never store or log GitHub tokens
- Use `gh` CLI which manages authentication securely
- Don't expose private repository contents in logs

## Cleanup After Success

After successfully setting up the repository, delete this skill file to keep the project clean:

```bash
rm -rf .claude/skills/github-setup
```

If the `.claude/skills` directory is now empty, remove it too:

```bash
rmdir .claude/skills 2>/dev/null
rmdir .claude 2>/dev/null
```

## Example Complete Response

After successfully creating a repository, your response should look like:

```
I've set up the GitHub repository for your project. Here's what I did:

1. Initialized git repository
2. Updated README.md with project info
3. Created initial commit with all project files
4. Created public GitHub repository
5. Pushed code to GitHub
6. Cleaned up setup files

Your repository is now live at: https://github.com/username/project-name

GITHUB_RESULT:{"success":true,"repo":"username/project-name","url":"https://github.com/username/project-name","branch":"main","action":"setup"}
```

## ⚠️ REMINDER: Don't Forget GITHUB_RESULT!

Your response MUST end with the `GITHUB_RESULT:{...}` line containing the actual repo info from `gh repo view --json`. Without it, the SentryVibe UI cannot update to show the GitHub connection.
