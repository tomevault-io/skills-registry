# Lisa Project Review

This skill compares Lisa's source templates against a target project that has Lisa applied, identifying what the project has changed from Lisa and offering to adopt those improvements back into Lisa.

This is the inverse of `/lisa-review-implementation`:
- **lisa:review-implementation**: Run FROM project → "What did I change from Lisa?"
- **lisa:review-project**: Run FROM Lisa → "What has this project changed?"

## Prerequisites

This skill must be run FROM the Lisa repository directory. The target project must have Lisa already applied.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Validate Lisa Directory

Confirm running from Lisa by checking for `src/core/lisa.ts`.

If not in Lisa, error with:
```
This command must be run FROM the Lisa repository.

Current directory does not contain src/core/lisa.ts.

Usage: /lisa-review-project /path/to/target-project
```

### Step 2: Validate Arguments

If no project path provided, ask the user:
```
Which project would you like to review?

Path: [user provides path]
```

Validate the project path:
1. Check the path exists and is a directory
2. Check at least one project marker exists:
   - `package.json` (Node-based projects)
   - `Gemfile` or `config/application.rb` (Rails projects)

### Step 3: Detect Project Types

Parse the project's `package.json` and filesystem to detect its type(s):

- **npm-package**: `package.json` without `"private": true` AND has `main`, `bin`, `exports`, or `files`
- **cdk**: `cdk.json` exists OR `aws-cdk` in package.json dependencies
- **nestjs**: `nest-cli.json` exists OR `@nestjs` in package.json dependencies
- **expo**: `app.json` exists OR `eas.json` exists OR `expo` in package.json dependencies
- **typescript**: `tsconfig.json` exists OR `typescript` in package.json dependencies
- **rails**: `Gemfile` exists OR `config/application.rb` exists

Build the type hierarchy. Example: if `expo` detected, types = `[all, typescript, expo]`

If no types detected, use `[all]`.

### Step 4: Scan Lisa Template Directories

Instead of reading a manifest, scan Lisa's template directories directly to build the list of managed files.

For each type in the hierarchy (e.g., `[all, typescript, expo]`):
1. List files in `{type}/copy-overwrite/` — record each as `(relativePath, "copy-overwrite", sourceTemplate)`
2. List files in `{type}/copy-contents/` — record each as `(relativePath, "copy-contents", sourceTemplate)`
3. If `{type}/package-lisa/package.lisa.json` exists, include `package.json` in the managed set and build its expected contents by merging every detected type's package-lisa template in hierarchy order.
4. If the same `relativePath` appears in multiple copy-* types, the most specific type wins (last in hierarchy).

This gives you the complete list of Lisa-managed files and their source templates.

**Skip these strategies** (they're intentionally customized):
- `create-only` - meant to be customized by project
- `merge` - already merged into project's file

### Step 5: Compare Files

For files with source found and strategy is `copy-overwrite` or `copy-contents`:

1. Read both the Lisa source and project version
2. If identical, mark as "in-sync"
3. If different:
   - Generate diff using: `diff -u "{lisa-source}" "{project-file}" || true`
   - Mark as "drifted"
   - Store diff for report

### Step 6: Analyze and Categorize

For each drifted file, provide brief analysis:

- **Improvement**: Change that makes the file better (better CI config, cleaner code, etc.)
- **Customization**: Change specific to this project (environment config, custom paths, etc.)
- **Bug fix**: Fixing an issue in Lisa's template
- **Divergence**: Change that's neither an improvement nor needed customization (concerning)

### Step 7: Generate Report

Create a markdown report:

```markdown
# Lisa Project Review

**Lisa Directory:** {lisa-path}
**Target Project:** {project-path}
**Project Types:** {types}
**Project Name:** {from package.json name or basename}
**Generated:** {current date/time ISO}

## Summary

- **Total managed files:** X
- **In sync:** X
- **Drifted:** X
- **Intentionally customized (create-only/merge):** X
- **Source not found:** X

## Drifted Files

### {relative/path/to/file}

**Source:** {type}/copy-overwrite/{path}
**Strategy:** copy-overwrite
**Category:** Improvement

<details>
<summary>View diff (Lisa <- Project)</summary>

\`\`\`diff
{diff output}
\`\`\`

</details>

**Analysis:** {Brief analysis of the change and why it matters}

---

[Repeat for each drifted file]

## Files Present in Lisa Templates but Missing from Project

These files exist in Lisa templates but not in the project:

- {file1}
- {file2}

This might mean:
- Lisa hasn't been applied to this project yet
- The file was deleted by the project
- The file is gitignored

## Intentionally Customized

These files use `create-only` or `merge` strategies and are meant to be customized:

- {file1}
- {file2}

## In Sync Files

<details>
<summary>X files match Lisa templates exactly</summary>

- {file1}
- {file2}

</details>
```

### Step 8: Offer to Adopt Changes

After the report, present the findings:

```
I found X files that have drifted from Lisa's templates.

[List files with categories]

Would you like to:
1. Review specific drifted files in detail
2. Adopt improvements from this project back into Lisa
3. Just view the full report
4. Done - no changes
```

If user wants to adopt improvements:

1. Ask which files to adopt (let them select multiple)
2. For each selected file:
   - Determine the target path in Lisa (preserve type directory)
   - Confirm: "Copy project version to `{type}/copy-overwrite/{path}`?"
   - If confirmed, use Write tool to copy project file to Lisa
   - Report success

### Important Notes

- **Never auto-adopt without confirmation** - always ask the user first
- **Preserve the most specific type directory** - if a file exists in both `typescript/` and `all/`, adopt to where it currently exists in Lisa
- **Handle missing files gracefully** - if project file is missing but exists in Lisa templates, note it (possible deletion or git-ignored)
- **Compare carefully** - some differences may be platform-specific (line endings, env vars) and should NOT be adopted
- The diff shows "Lisa <- Project" (what project changed FROM Lisa)
