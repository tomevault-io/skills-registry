description: View, set, and verify the custom guard rules enforced by Lisa's safety-net PreToolUse Bash hook (parity-safety-net.sh). The consolidated cross-agent equivalent of the upstream safety-net plugin's set-custom-rules + verify-custom-rules skills — manages a project-local list of extended-regex patterns that block destructive shell commands, on Codex, agy, Copilot, Cursor, and Claude. Use when this capability is needed.

# Parity Safety-Net Rules

Manage the **custom guard rules** that Lisa's safety-net hook enforces on every
Bash command. The hook (`hooks/parity-safety-net.sh`, registered as a
`PreToolUse` matcher on `Bash`) ships with built-in guards against catastrophic
commands; this skill lets a project **view**, **set**, and **verify** *additional*
project-specific rules on top of those built-ins.

> **Lisa-native reimplementation.** This consolidates the upstream
> `safety-net@cc-marketplace` plugin's two rule-management skills
> (`set-custom-rules` + `verify-custom-rules`) into one. It is reimplemented from
> scratch against Lisa conventions — it does **not** port or invoke upstream
> plugin code.
>
> **Drift tracking.** Pinned to `safety-net@cc-marketplace@0.9.0`.
> `scripts/plugin-parity-drift.mjs` compares this pin against the upstream
> version in the plugin cache and flags staleness. **Do not port or copy upstream
> plugin code.**

## How the rules work

- The hook always enforces its **built-in guards** (see below). These cannot be
  disabled from the rules file — they are the floor.
- **Custom rules** live in a project-local file, one **POSIX extended regular
  expression (ERE)** per line. Blank lines and lines beginning with `#` are
  ignored. Matching is case-insensitive (`grep -Ei`).
- If *any* built-in guard or custom rule matches the proposed command, the hook
  exits non-zero and the Bash call is **blocked**, with the reason shown to the
  agent.

### Rules file location

Resolved in this order:

1. `$SAFETY_NET_RULES_FILE` (explicit override), else
2. `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/.claude/safety-net-rules.txt`

```bash
RULES_FILE="${SAFETY_NET_RULES_FILE:-${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/.claude/safety-net-rules.txt}"
```

### Built-in guards (always on)

1. `rm -rf` of a filesystem root, `$HOME`/`~`, or a top-level wildcard.
2. Force-pushing a protected branch (`main`/`master`/`production`/`release`).
   `--force-with-lease` is intentionally allowed.
3. `git reset --hard` while the working tree is **dirty** (would discard work).
4. Destructive SQL — `DROP DATABASE/SCHEMA/TABLE`, `TRUNCATE TABLE`.

## View the current rules

```bash
RULES_FILE="${SAFETY_NET_RULES_FILE:-${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/.claude/safety-net-rules.txt}"
if [ -f "$RULES_FILE" ]; then
  echo "Custom safety-net rules ($RULES_FILE):"
  grep -vE '^[[:space:]]*(#|$)' "$RULES_FILE" || echo "(no active rules)"
else
  echo "No custom rules file yet ($RULES_FILE). Only built-in guards are active."
fi
```

`Read` the file to show comments and structure as well.

## Set (add or edit) a rule

A rule is an ERE matched against the full command string. Keep rules **specific**
to avoid blocking legitimate work — anchor on the dangerous verb and its target.

1. Ensure the file exists, then **append** a commented rule (use `Edit`/`Write`,
   or append from the shell):

   ```bash
   RULES_FILE="${SAFETY_NET_RULES_FILE:-${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/.claude/safety-net-rules.txt}"
   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$RULES_FILE")"
   {
     echo "# Block deleting a Kubernetes namespace"
     echo 'kubectl[[:space:]]+delete[[:space:]]+namespace'
   } >> "$RULES_FILE"
   ```

2. **Always verify** the new rule (next section) before considering it set —
   confirm it blocks what it should and allows what it shouldn't.

Editing/removing: open the file with `Edit` and change or delete the line.
Removing a rule never affects the built-in guards.

## Verify the rules

Two checks — both should pass before you trust a rule.

### 1. The ERE is valid

An invalid regex would make the hook error on every command. Validate it:

```bash
printf '%s' "$RULE" | grep -Eq -- "$RULE" 2>/dev/null && echo "valid ERE" \
  || echo "INVALID ERE — fix before saving"
```

### 2. The rule behaves as intended

Drive the **actual hook** with a fake `PreToolUse` payload and assert the exit
code (non-zero = blocked, 0 = allowed). Build the JSON with `jq` so the test
command line itself never contains the dangerous literal:

```bash
HOOK="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/parity-safety-net.sh"

check() { # check <expect: block|allow> <command>
  jq -nc --arg c "$2" '{tool_name:"Bash",tool_input:{command:$c}}' \
    | bash "$HOOK" >/dev/null 2>&1
  local code=$?
  local got=allow; [ "$code" -ne 0 ] && got=block
  printf '%-5s want=%-5s got=%-5s  %s\n' \
    "$([ "$got" = "$1" ] && echo OK || echo FAIL)" "$1" "$got" "$2"
}

# Should block (matches the new rule):
check block "kubectl delete namespace prod"
# Should allow (must not over-match):
check allow "kubectl get pods"
```

Report a table of cases with want/got/verdict. If any case disagrees, tighten the
ERE and re-verify.

## Rules

- **Built-in guards are the floor** — custom rules only *add* blocks; they cannot
  weaken the built-ins.
- **Prefer specific over broad** — a rule that blocks too much trains users to
  bypass the safety net. Anchor on verb + target.
- **Verify every rule against the real hook** before saving — never ship an
  unverified or syntactically invalid ERE.
- **Never weaken the net to unblock yourself.** If a built-in guard fires on a
  command that is genuinely safe, run it manually outside the agent after the
  user confirms — do not edit the hook to remove the guard.
