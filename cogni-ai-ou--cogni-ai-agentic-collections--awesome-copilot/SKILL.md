## Project Overview

The Awesome GitHub Copilot repository is a community-driven collection of custom agents and instructions designed to enhance GitHub Copilot experiences across various domains, languages, and use cases. The project includes:

- **Agents** - Specialized GitHub Copilot agents that integrate with MCP servers.
- **Instructions** - Coding standards and best practices applied to specific file patterns.
- **Skills** - Self-contained folders with instructions and bundled resources for specialized tasks.
- **Hooks** - Automated workflows triggered by specific events during development.
- **Workflows** - Agentic Workflows for AI-powered repository automation in GitHub Actions.
- **Plugins** - Installable packages that group related agents, commands, and skills around specific themes.

## Core Process

### Install a Plugin

1. **Attempt direct installation**. For most users, the Awesome Copilot marketplace is already registered:
   ```bash
   copilot plugin install <plugin-name>@awesome-copilot
   ```

2. **Fallback for older versions or custom setups**. If the marketplace is unknown, register it first:
   ```bash
   copilot plugin marketplace add github/awesome-copilot
   copilot plugin install <plugin-name>@awesome-copilot
   ```
