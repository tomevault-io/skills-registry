# Pre-Launch Landing Page Builder

Build Astro landing pages for product concept validation within the Pagelane Site Blueprint.

## Scope

**This skill covers:** Pre-launch pages for validating product demand before building.
- Waitlist/email capture pages
- Coming soon pages  
- Early access signup pages
- Concept validation landing pages

**This skill does NOT cover:** Product interfaces disguised as landing pages (prompt-as-hero patterns like Manus, Bolt.new) - those require a working product backend.

## Workflow

1. **Read** Scout handover → get research-backed inputs
2. **Decide** visual direction → based on research + differentiation strategy
3. **Select** hero pattern → based on available assets
4. **Assemble** components → from checklist
5. **Apply** copy framework → headlines, CTAs, social proof
6. **Validate** against Site Blueprint requirements

## Step 1: Read Scout Handover

Look for `factory-handover.yaml` in the Scout output. This contains:

```yaml
# Key fields to extract:
product:
  category: "ai-dev-tool" | "b2b-saas" | "consumer-app" | "creator-tool"
  positioning: "One-line positioning"

customer_segments:
  primary: { name, characteristics }
  secondary: { name, characteristics }

visual_consensus:
  recommended_mode: "dark" | "light"
  recommended_accent: "color name"
  hero_recommendation: "screenshot" | "video" | "classic"
  patterns_observed: [{ pattern, frequency }]

differentiation_opportunities:
  visual: ["List of ways to stand out"]
  
pricing_intelligence:
  recommended_model: "freemium" | "paid" | "enterprise"
  entry_price_benchmark: "$X/mo"

social_proof_patterns:
  most_common: ["user-count", "logos", etc.]
```

**If handover is missing:** Fall back to Step 2 defaults, but flag that decisions are not research-backed.

## Step 2: Visual Direction Decision

Use Scout research to make informed choices:

### Option A: Align with Market (Red Ocean / Validation Focus)
Choose when: Testing demand in established market, want to look credible

→ Use `visual_consensus.recommended_mode`
→ Use `visual_consensus.recommended_accent`
→ Follow dominant `patterns_observed`

### Option B: Differentiate (Blue Ocean / Standout Focus)
Choose when: Market is crowded, competitors look identical, want to stand out

→ Check `differentiation_opportunities.visual`
→ Invert the dominant pattern (if 8/10 are dark, go light)
→ Use unexpected accent color

### Decision Framework

```
Is competitor visual landscape homogeneous (>70% same pattern)?
├── YES → Consider differentiation (Option B)
│         Ask: Will standing out help or hurt credibility?
└── NO  → Align with successful patterns (Option A)

Is this a technical/developer audience?
├── YES → Dark mode likely expected; differentiation risky
└── NO  → More freedom to experiment

Does Scout recommend differentiation?
├── YES → Follow their visual differentiation suggestions
└── NO  → Align with consensus
```

### Fallback Defaults (if no Scout handover)

| Category | Default Direction |
|----------|-------------------|
| **AI/Dev Tool** | Dark mode, emerald accent, monospace accents |
| **B2B SaaS** | Light mode, indigo accent, clean sans-serif |
| **Consumer App** | Light/gradient, vibrant accent, rounded UI |
| **Creator Tool** | Dark/editorial, purple accent, bold typography |

See `references/visual-system.md` for complete palettes when customizing.

## Step 3: Hero Pattern Selection

Check Scout's `visual_consensus.hero_recommendation` first, then choose based on available assets:

**Scout recommends "video" or "demo"?**
→ Use **Demo Hero**: Headline + subheadline + embedded video/GIF showing the product vision
→ If no video available, flag gap and fall back to next option

**Scout recommends "screenshot" or have strong visual asset?**
→ Use **Screenshot Hero**: Headline + subheadline + product mockup/screenshot

**Scout recommends "classic" or nothing available yet?**
→ Use **Classic Hero**: Headline + subheadline + CTA button + abstract illustration or gradient

**Have traction metrics from Scout's research?**
→ Use **Social Proof Hero**: Lead with metrics/logos, then headline + CTA
→ Use `social_proof_patterns.most_common` to decide what type of proof

See `references/components.md` for Astro component patterns for each hero type.

## Step 4: Component Assembly

### Required Components (Site Blueprint enforced)

- [ ] `@sites/seo` integration with `seo.config.yaml`
- [ ] `@sites/analytics` PostHog integration
- [ ] Email capture form → POST to Pulse `/api/emails/capture`
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout
- [ ] Accessible markup (semantic HTML, ARIA where needed)

### Standard Components (include unless reason to omit)

- [ ] Header: Logo + minimal nav (2-4 links max) + CTA button
- [ ] Hero section (pattern from Step 2)
- [ ] Value proposition (3-4 bullet points OR single paragraph)
- [ ] Social proof strip (logos, quotes, metrics, or "as seen in")
- [ ] Footer: Links + legal + copyright

### Optional Components (based on Scout brief)

- [ ] Feature grid (3-6 features with icons)
- [ ] How it works (3-4 numbered steps)
- [ ] FAQ section (4-8 questions)
- [ ] Pricing preview (if relevant for validation)
- [ ] Team/founder section (for trust building)
- [ ] Testimonial cards (if available)

See `references/components.md` for implementation patterns.

## Step 5: Copy Framework

### Use Scout Positioning

Start with `product.positioning` from Scout handover. This is the research-backed one-liner.

If adapting, keep aligned with validated customer segments:
- Primary segment: `customer_segments.primary.name`
- Their characteristics: `customer_segments.primary.characteristics`

### Headline Formula

Use one of these patterns:

1. **Outcome-focused**: "[Achieve X] without [pain point Y]"
2. **Category-defining**: "The [category] for [audience]"
3. **Contrast**: "[Old way] is dead. [New way] is here."
4. **Direct value**: "[Action verb] your [thing] in [timeframe]"

**Length**: 4-10 words. Shorter is better.

### Subheadline

Expand on the headline with specifics:
- What the product does (concretely)
- Who it's for
- Key differentiator

**Length**: 15-25 words. One or two sentences.

### CTA Language by Stage

| Stage | Primary CTA | Secondary CTA |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Early concept | "Join the waitlist" | "Learn more" |
| Building in public | "Get early access" | "Follow updates" |
| Beta ready | "Request beta access" | "See how it works" |
| Launch imminent | "Get started free" | "Book a demo" |

### Pricing Preview (if included)

Reference Scout's `pricing_intelligence`:
- Use `recommended_model` (freemium, paid, etc.)
- Benchmark against `entry_price_benchmark`
- Note competitor tier structures in `phase-2-research.yaml`

For pre-launch: Consider "Starting at $X/mo" teaser if price is validated.

### Urgency/Scarcity (use sparingly)

- Cohort limits: "Joining first 100 users"
- Timeline: "Launching Q1 2025"
- Exclusivity: "Invite-only beta"

**Avoid**: Countdown timers (0/15 top pages use them), fake scarcity, pressure tactics.

See `references/copy-examples.md` for real examples from high-traffic pages.

## Step 6: Validation Checklist

Before marking site as complete:

### Site Blueprint Compliance
- [ ] `@sites/seo` configured with meta, OG, structured data
- [ ] `@sites/analytics` PostHog events firing
- [ ] Email capture POSTs to Pulse API
- [ ] `wrangler.toml` configured for Cloudflare Workers
- [ ] `seo.config.yaml` complete

### Conversion Optimization
- [ ] Single clear primary CTA (repeated 2-3x on page)
- [ ] Email form above the fold OR sticky
- [ ] Value proposition clear within 5 seconds
- [ ] Social proof visible within first scroll
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design

### Technical Quality
- [ ] Lighthouse score ≥ 90
- [ ] No layout shift on load
- [ ] Images optimized (WebP, lazy loading)
- [ ] Semantic HTML structure

## Visual Quick Reference

### Color Defaults by Category

```
AI/Dev Tool:    bg:#0a0a0a  text:#fafafa  accent:#10b981 (emerald)
B2B SaaS:       bg:#ffffff  text:#1f2937  accent:#4f46e5 (indigo)
Consumer:       bg:#ffffff  text:#111827  accent:#f59e0b (amber)
Creator:        bg:#18181b  text:#fafafa  accent:#a855f7 (purple)
```

### Typography Defaults

```
Headlines:  Bold, 48-72px, tight tracking (-0.02em)
Subhead:    Medium, 20-24px, normal tracking
Body:       Regular, 16-18px, 1.6 line-height
```

### Spacing Scale (Tailwind)

```
Section padding:  py-24 (mobile: py-16)
Component gap:    gap-8 or gap-12
Max content:      max-w-3xl (text), max-w-6xl (layout)
```

## Anti-Patterns

Never do:
- Multiple competing CTAs in hero
- Countdown timers
- Generic stock photography
- Navigation with 6+ links
- Walls of text without hierarchy
- Prompt inputs without backend (prompt-as-hero requires working product)
- Lorem ipsum or placeholder content
- Auto-playing video with sound
