# Work Decomposition

This skill guides the process of breaking higher-level work into actionable lower-level items.

## The Decomposition Chain

```
Vision: "Make X a better experience"
    ↓
Initiative: "Reduce page load time by 50%"
    ↓
Tasks: "Profile slow queries", "Add caching layer", "Optimize images"
```

Each level breaks work above it into concrete, actionable pieces at appropriate scope.

## When to Decompose

Decompose **ahead of capacity**, not upfront:

- When team's current backlog is nearing its end
- During tail end of current work to prepare next batch
- When backlog is getting low (signal to look up and pull work down)

**Avoid**: Decomposing everything upfront (waterfall). Have work ready when capacity frees up, not entire project planned before starting.

## The Decompose Phase

Initiatives have an explicit "decompose" phase:

```
discovery → design → ready → decompose → active → completed
```

### Why Decompose is Explicit

The decompose phase creates a **visible buffer**:
- Solutions can pile up waiting to be broken into tasks
- Tracks how long things sit here
- Makes bottlenecks visible in multi-team environments

**Don't skip to decompose early.** Premature decomposition leads to tasks that solve wrong problems, rework when design changes, wasted effort.

## Sizing by Scope, Not Time

Size by scope and impact, not implementation time:

### Tasks: Atomic Units
- **Scope**: Discrete, completable piece with clear done criteria
- **Impact**: Moves the needle on parent initiative
- **Independence**: Can be worked without constant coordination
- **Examples**: "Add caching layer", "Write migration script", "Update API endpoint"

**If a task has meaningful subtasks**, it should probably be an initiative.

### Initiatives: Capability Increments
- **Scope**: Creates fundamental increment in capability
- **Impact**: Meaningfully changes what system can do
- **Coherence**: Tasks within work toward unified outcome
- **Examples**: "User authentication", "Search functionality", "Billing integration"

**If it doesn't change what system can do**, it might just be a task.

## Decomposition Patterns

### Vertical Slices (Preferred)
Break by user-visible functionality:
```
Initiative: "User authentication"
├── Task: "Login flow"
├── Task: "Registration flow"
├── Task: "Password reset"
└── Task: "Session management"
```
Each task delivers something user can see/use.

### Horizontal Layers (Use Sparingly)
Break by technical component:
```
Initiative: "User authentication"
├── Task: "Database schema"
├── Task: "API endpoints"
├── Task: "Frontend components"
└── Task: "Integration tests"
```
Creates dependencies between tasks. Prefer vertical slices.

### Risk-First
Break by unknowns:
```
Initiative: "ML recommendation engine"
├── Task: "Spike: Evaluate model options" (high uncertainty)
├── Task: "Build training pipeline" (after spike)
└── Task: "Integration with product" (low uncertainty)
```
Address risky/uncertain work first to fail fast.

### Milestone-Based
Break by deliverable checkpoints:
```
Initiative: "Platform migration"
├── Task: "Phase 1: Read path on new platform"
├── Task: "Phase 2: Write path on new platform"
├── Task: "Phase 3: Deprecate old platform"
└── Task: "Phase 4: Cleanup"
```
Each milestone independently valuable and deployable.

## Quality Checklist

Good decomposition - each child item:
- **Independently valuable**: Delivers something useful alone
- **Clearly scoped**: Know when it's done
- **Right-sized**: Matches scope expectations for level
- **Aligned to parent**: Clearly contributes to level above

Bad decomposition smells:
- **Too granular**: "write line 42" - steps, not tasks
- **Too vague**: "make it better" - no completion criteria
- **Wrong level**: Doesn't match document type scope
- **Orphaned**: Doesn't trace back to parent
- **Overlapping**: Multiple items covering same ground

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Decomposing too early | Tasks solve wrong problem | Stay in discovery/design until approach clear |
| Decomposing too late | Initiative active with no tasks | Decompose before moving to active |
| Wrong granularity | Tasks that are initiatives or vice versa | Apply scope heuristics |
| Missing alignment | Tasks don't contribute to initiative | Each task needs obvious connection to parent |

## Judgment Calls

- **Uncertain scope?** Create spike/research task first, then decompose based on findings
- **Large initiative?** Consider if it's really multiple capability increments
- **Tiny initiative?** Consider if it's really just a task
- **Cross-cutting?** May need tasks under multiple initiatives, or dedicated "platform" initiative
