# Project Patterns

This skill guides project setup and provides patterns for different types of work.

## Choosing a Preset

| Team Size | Coordination | Recommended Preset |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Solo | None | Direct |
| 2-5 | Informal | Streamlined |
| 5+ | Formal | Streamlined |

**Preset differences:**
- **Direct**: Vision → Task (simplest, solo work)
- **Streamlined**: Vision → Initiative → Task (most common, **default**)

When in doubt, use the default Streamlined preset. Use Streamlined unless tasks are simple enough for Direct.

## Greenfield Projects

Starting a new project from scratch.

### When to Use
- New product or system
- Major rewrite (treat as new)
- Proof of concept → production
- New team forming

### The Pattern

**1. Initialize:**
```
initialize_project(project_path="/path/to/project", prefix="PROJ")
```
Choose short (2-8 char, uppercase), memorable, unique prefix.

**2. Define Vision:**
Create vision answering: "Why does this project exist?"
- Objectives: What outcomes?
- Values: Why does it matter?
- Success criteria: How to know we succeeded?

Transition: draft → review → published

**3. Create Initial Initiatives:**
Common greenfield initiatives:
- **Foundation/Setup**: Dev environment, CI/CD, architecture
- **Core Feature**: Main thing this project does
- **Integration**: Connecting to other systems
- **Release/Launch**: Getting to production

Don't create all initiatives upfront. Create enough to start, pull more as backlogs empty.

**4. Decompose and Execute:**
For each initiative: discovery → design → decompose → execute

### Greenfield Tips
- **Start small**: Maximum uncertainty, learn as you go
- **Foundation first**: But don't gold-plate it
- **Expect pivots**: Early initiatives may invalidate later plans
- **ADRs from day one**: Capture decisions while context fresh
- **Specifications for key systems**: Create specifications for core system components as living design documents

## Tech Debt Campaigns

Systematic debt reduction.

### When to Use
- Accumulated technical debt affecting velocity
- Scheduled "debt sprints"
- Pre-migration cleanup
- Quality improvement initiatives

### The Pattern

**1. Inventory:** Create backlog items for each debt item:
```
create_document(type="task", title="Refactor X module", backlog_category="tech-debt")
```

**2. Prioritize:** Group related debt into initiative when ready to tackle:
```
create_document(type="initiative", title="API Cleanup Campaign", parent_id="PROJ-V-0001")
```

**3. Execute:** Pull debt tasks into initiative, work systematically

### Tech Debt Tips
- Don't boil ocean: Focused campaigns > everything at once
- Tie to value: Why does fixing this matter?
- Measure impact: Before/after metrics validate effort
- Prevent recurrence: ADRs for decisions that caused debt

## Incident Response

Handling urgent, unplanned work.

### When to Use
- Production incidents
- Critical bugs
- Security vulnerabilities
- Customer escalations

### The Pattern

**1. Immediate:** Create backlog item for tracking:
```
create_document(type="task", title="INCIDENT: Service X down", backlog_category="bug")
```

**2. Triage:** Work the incident, update task with findings

**3. Resolution:** Complete immediate fix, transition task to completed

**4. Follow-up:** For systemic fixes, create initiative:
```
create_document(type="initiative", title="Prevent X recurrence", parent_id="PROJ-V-0001")
```

**5. Postmortem:** Create ADR if architectural decisions made

### Incident Tips
- Track immediately: Even if "just a quick fix"
- Separate fix from prevention: Quick fix now, proper fix later
- Don't skip follow-up: Initiatives for systemic improvements
- Document decisions: ADRs capture why you chose approach

## Feature Development

Standard feature flow.

### When to Use
- New features planned in roadmap
- Enhancements to existing features
- Customer-requested functionality

### The Pattern

**1. Initiative:** Create initiative for the feature:
```
create_document(type="initiative", title="User Dashboard", parent_id="PROJ-V-0001", complexity="m")
```

**2. Discovery:** Understand requirements, constraints, users

**3. Design:** Define solution approach, create ADRs for decisions, create specifications for system design

**4. Decompose:** Break into tasks (prefer vertical slices)

**5. Execute:** Pull tasks, implement, test

**6. Complete:** Verify acceptance criteria, transition to completed

### Feature Tips
- Discovery matters: Understand before designing
- Vertical slices: User-visible increments over technical layers
- Exit criteria: Define "done" clearly
- Iterate: Ship incrementally, get feedback

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Shadow work** | Work outside system | Track everything; create backlog items retroactively |
| **Shadow backlogs** | Secret lists elsewhere | Capture in Metis; trust or fix the system |
| **Too many active** | Context switching | Limit WIP; finish before starting |
| **Orphaned work** | No value alignment | Connect to parent or move to backlog |
| **Skipping phases** | Problems found late | Respect exit criteria |
| **Premature decomposition** | Wrong tasks | Stay in discovery/design first |
| **Stale work** | Clutter | Archive unused items regularly |
| **Wrong granularity** | Confused tracking | Apply scope heuristics |

## Core Principles

- **Work is pulled, never pushed**: Low backlog signals to look up
- **All work traces to vision**: If it doesn't align, question value
- **Phases exist for a reason**: Don't skip them
- **Filesystem is truth**: Database is cache
- **Scope over time**: Size by capability, not duration
