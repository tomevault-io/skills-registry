# Reflect - Intelligent Learning System

## Overview

Reflect captures learnings from conversations and saves them to Forgetful Memory, creating a feedback loop that improves future interactions. Learnings are categorized, linked to skills/projects/entities, and periodically synthesized into skill improvements.

## Quick Reference

| Command                       | Purpose                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/reflect`                    | Analyze current session, capture learnings |
| `/reflect [skill]`            | Focus analysis on specific skill           |
| `/reflect status`             | Show learning statistics                   |
| `/reflect synthesize [skill]` | Propose skill improvements from learnings  |
| `/reflect graph [skill]`      | Visualize learning connections             |
| `/reflect stale`              | Find outdated learnings                    |
| `/reflect conflicts`          | Find contradictory learnings               |

## Learning Types

See [LEARNING_TYPES.md](LEARNING_TYPES.md) for detailed reference.

| Type         | Tag            | Importance | Signal                                        |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Correction   | `correction`   | 9          | User said "no", "not like that", explicit fix |
| Preference   | `preference`   | 8          | Repeated choices, "I prefer", "always use"    |
| Pattern      | `pattern`      | 7          | Successful approach, "this worked well"       |
| Edge Case    | `edge-case`    | 7          | Unexpected scenario, workaround needed        |
| Anti-pattern | `anti-pattern` | 9          | "Never do this", caused problems              |

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Session

Scan the conversation for learning signals:

**HIGH confidence signals (corrections):**

- User said "no", "wrong", "not like that", "I meant..."
- User explicitly corrected output
- User requested changes immediately after generation
- User expressed frustration

**MEDIUM confidence signals (preferences/patterns):**

- User said "perfect", "great", "yes", "exactly"
- User accepted output without modification
- User built upon the output
- Repeated choices across the session

**MEDIUM confidence signals (edge cases):**

- Questions the approach didn't anticipate
- Scenarios requiring workarounds
- Features user asked for that weren't covered

### Step 2: Check for Existing Similar Learnings

Before creating new memories, ALWAYS query for similar existing ones:

```python
# MCP tool invocation pseudocode (not executable Python)
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("query_memory", {
  "query": "<learning topic keywords>",
  "query_context": "Checking for existing similar learnings before creating new",
  "tags": ["skill-learning"],
  "k": 5,
  "include_links": True
})
```

**If similar learning exists:**

- Same topic, same conclusion → Update existing (bump importance if repeated)
- Same topic, different conclusion → Flag as conflict, link both
- Related but distinct → Create new, link to existing

### Step 3: Determine Scope

Identify what scope this learning applies to:

| Scope        | When                         | How to Tag          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Personal     | User-specific preference     | Link to user entity |
| Project      | Project-specific pattern     | Use `project_ids`   |
| Skill        | Skill-specific learning      | Tag with skill name |
| Organization | Applies to all Compass Brand | Tag with `org-wide` |

### Step 4: Create Structured Memory

```python
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("create_memory", {
  "title": "[TYPE] Brief description",
  "content": "Detailed learning with context. What happened, why it matters, how to apply.",
  "context": "Captured during [skill/task] - [why this is important]",
  "keywords": ["topic1", "topic2", "skill-name"],
  "tags": ["skill-learning", "<type>", "<skill-name>"],
  "importance": <6-10 based on type and confidence>,
  "project_ids": [<if project-specific>]
})
```

### Step 5: Link Related Entities

If the learning involves specific people, technologies, or concepts:

```python
# Link to entity (person, technology, etc.)
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("link_entity_to_memory", {
  "entity_id": <entity_id>,
  "memory_id": <new_memory_id>
})

# Link to related memories
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("link_memories", {
  "memory_id": <new_memory_id>,
  "related_ids": [<related_memory_ids>]
})
```

### Step 6: Present Summary

```text
┌─ Learning Captured ───────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                           │
│  Type: [CORRECTION/PREFERENCE/PATTERN/etc.]               │
│  Skill: [skill-name or "general"]                         │
│  Scope: [personal/project/skill/org-wide]                 │
│                                                           │
│  Title: [learning title]                                  │
│  Confidence: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] (occurrence #X)            │
│                                                           │
│  Linked to:                                               │
│  • Memory #42: [related learning]                         │
│  • Entity: [person/technology]                            │
│                                                           │
│  Memory ID: #[new_id]                                     │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Confidence Tracking

Track learning confidence through repetition:

| Occurrences | Confidence | Importance | Action                         |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1           | Low        | 6-7        | Create memory                  |
| 2           | Medium     | 7-8        | Link to first, note repetition |
| 3+          | High       | 8-9        | Consider graduating to skill   |

When a pattern repeats:

```python
# Update existing memory
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("update_memory", {
  "memory_id": <existing_id>,
  "importance": min(10, current_importance + 1),
  "content": "<updated content noting repetition count>"
})
```

## Integration Points

### Proactive Loading

When a skill starts, query relevant learnings:

```python
mcp__forgetful__execute_forgetful_tool("query_memory", {
  "query": "<skill-name> preferences corrections patterns",
  "query_context": "Loading learnings before skill execution",
  "tags": ["skill-learning"],
  "k": 5
})
```

### Correction Detection

Note: Stop hooks were removed from the reflect system (see `.claude/settings.json`). The system no longer automatically monitors for corrections. Use `/reflect` manually after sessions or when you want to capture learnings.
