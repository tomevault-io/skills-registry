# Implementation Checklist

Create comprehensive, testable implementation plans that break complex features into manageable steps.

## When to Use

- User asks to plan a feature implementation
- User wants to break down a large task
- User requests an implementation roadmap or checklist
- You identify a task that needs structured planning (3+ major components)

## Structure

### Overall Format

```markdown
# [Feature Name] - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Brief description of the feature and its goals.

## Phases

### Phase 1: [Phase Name] (X steps)

#### Step X.Y: [Step Name]
Brief description of what this step accomplishes.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Specific file or component to create
- [ ] Another deliverable with concrete output
- [ ] Implementation details (specific functions, classes, etc.)

**Tests:**
- [ ] Specific test scenario to verify
- [ ] Another test scenario
- [ ] Edge cases to cover

**Success Criteria:** [Clear definition of done for this step]

---
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Testable Steps

Every step should have:
- **Concrete deliverables** (files, classes, functions)
- **Specific tests** (not "add tests" but "test concurrent access", "test error handling for X")
- **Clear success criteria** (measurable, like "all tests pass" or "API returns expected response")

### 2. Small But Not Micro

- **Too large**: "Implement entire authentication system"
- **Too small**: "Add import statement for User class"
- **Just right**: "Implement JWT token validation with expiry checking"

Aim for steps that:
- Can be completed in one focused session
- Have clear input/output
- Can be tested independently when possible

### 3. Progressive Complexity

Order steps so that:
- Foundation pieces come first (data models, interfaces)
- Core logic comes next (business logic, algorithms)
- Integration comes after (platform-specific, UI)
- Polish comes last (documentation, samples, optimization)

### 4. Track Progress

As steps complete:
- Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for completed items
- Add **implementation notes** under completed steps
- Document **test results** (e.g., "✅ All 15 tests pass")
- Update **success criteria** with actual results

## Template Sections

### Deliverables Section

List specific, verifiable outputs:

```markdown
**Deliverables:**
- [x] `UserRepository.kt` with CRUD operations
- [x] `UserRepositoryImpl.kt` implementing thread-safe storage
- [x] Error handling for network failures
- [x] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [x] Connection pooling configuration
```

### Tests Section

List specific test scenarios:

```markdown
**Tests:**
- [x] Save user returns success for valid data
- [x] Save user returns error for duplicate email
- [x] Concurrent saves don't corrupt data
- [x] Network timeout triggers retry with backoff
- [x] Retry exhaustion returns final error
- [x] Connection pool limits concurrent requests
```

### Success Criteria

Clear, measurable definition of done:

```markdown
**Success Criteria:** ✅ Repository saves/loads users correctly, all 25 tests pass, thread-safe verified with 100 concurrent operations
```

## Phases Organization

Organize into logical phases:

```markdown
### Phase 1: Foundation (3 steps)
- Data models
- Storage interfaces
- Configuration

### Phase 2: Core Logic (4 steps)
- Business rules
- Validation
- State management
- Error handling

### Phase 3: Platform Integration (3 steps)
- Android implementation
- iOS implementation
- JVM implementation

### Phase 4: Polish (2 steps)
- Sample application
- Documentation
```

## Example: Small Feature

```markdown
# Email Validation - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Add comprehensive email validation with format checking and disposable email detection.

## Steps

### Step 1: Email Format Validator
Basic RFC-compliant email validation.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `EmailValidator.kt` with regex pattern matching
- [ ] Support for common TLDs and international characters
- [ ] Whitespace trimming and normalization

**Tests:**
- [ ] Valid emails pass (user@example.com)
- [ ] Invalid formats fail (no @, missing domain)
- [ ] Edge cases (unicode, subdomain, plus addressing)
- [ ] Performance (10000 validations < 100ms)

**Success Criteria:** Validates emails per RFC 5322, all tests pass

---

### Step 2: Disposable Email Detection
Block temporary/disposable email providers.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `DisposableEmailDetector.kt` with provider list
- [ ] 1000+ known disposable domains
- [ ] Efficient lookup (HashSet, O(1))

**Tests:**
- [ ] Known disposable domains detected (guerrillamail.com)
- [ ] Valid providers allowed (gmail.com, outlook.com)
- [ ] Case-insensitive matching
- [ ] Subdomain handling

**Success Criteria:** Detects disposable emails, lookup < 1ms

---

### Step 3: Integration
Combine validators into unified API.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `EmailValidationService` facade
- [ ] Combined validation (format + disposable)
- [ ] Clear error messages for each failure type

**Tests:**
- [ ] End-to-end validation flow
- [ ] Error message clarity
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

**Success Criteria:** Single validation API, all tests pass
```

## Updating Plans

As you work:

1. **Mark completed items**: Change `[ ]` to `[x]`
2. **Add implementation notes**: Details about decisions made, gotchas encountered
3. **Update success criteria**: Add actual results (test counts, performance numbers)
4. **Document deviations**: Explain any changes from original plan

Example of completed step:

```markdown
#### Step 1.1: Email Format Validator ✅ COMPLETE

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `EmailValidator.kt` with regex pattern matching
- [x] Support for common TLDs and international characters
- [x] Whitespace trimming and normalization
- [x] Implemented with Kotlin Regex (platform-agnostic)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Used RFC 5322 simplified pattern for KMP compatibility
- Added extension function `String.isValidEmail()` for convenience
- Normalization handles leading/trailing spaces and case

**Tests:**
- [x] 15 comprehensive tests in EmailValidatorTest
- [x] Valid email formats (50+ examples)
- [x] Invalid formats (30+ edge cases)
- [x] Unicode support verified
- [x] Performance: 10000 validations in 45ms

**Success Criteria:** ✅ Validates emails per RFC 5322, all 15 tests pass
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Vague Deliverables
❌ **Bad**: "Add authentication"  
✅ **Good**: "Implement `AuthService.kt` with login(), logout(), and validateToken()"

### Generic Tests
❌ **Bad**: "Add tests"  
✅ **Good**: "Test login with valid credentials, invalid password, expired token"

### Unclear Success
❌ **Bad**: "Authentication works"  
✅ **Good**: "Users can login/logout, tokens expire after 1 hour, all 12 tests pass"

## Tips

1. **Start with overview**: Brief feature description and goals
2. **Break into phases**: Group related steps (Foundation, Core, Integration, Polish)
3. **Name phases clearly**: Use descriptive names, not just "Phase 1"
4. **Number steps**: Use X.Y format (Phase.Step) for easy reference
5. **Be specific**: Concrete deliverables, not abstract concepts
6. **Make testable**: Every step should have verifiable tests
7. **Update continuously**: Mark progress, add notes, document deviations

## Common Phase Patterns

**Foundation Phase**: Data models, interfaces, configuration  
**Core Logic Phase**: Business rules, algorithms, state management  
**Platform Phase**: Platform-specific implementations (Android, iOS, JVM)  
**Integration Phase**: Wiring components together, orchestration  
**Sample Phase**: Demo applications, examples  
**Documentation Phase**: API docs, user guides, README  
**Polish Phase**: Performance optimization, edge cases, final cleanup

## Implementation Order Summary

At the end of the plan, include a summary section:

```markdown
## Implementation Order Summary

**Total Steps: ~18-20**

1. **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: 3 steps - Core types, interfaces, storage
2. **Phase 2 (Business Logic)**: 5 steps - Throttling, sentiment, strategies
3. **Phase 3 (Platform)**: 3 steps - Android, iOS, JVM implementations
4. **Phase 4 (Manager)**: 2 steps - Manager, singleton factory
5. **Phase 5 (Sample App)**: 3 steps - Basic UI, advanced features, testing
6. **Phase 6 (Documentation)**: 2 steps - API docs, user guides
7. **Phase 7 (Integration)**: 1 step - Project setup, publishing

**Estimated Total:** ~20 well-defined, testable steps.

Each step is:
- ✅ Independently testable
- ✅ Builds on previous work
- ✅ Has clear deliverables and success criteria
- ✅ Small enough to complete in focused session
- ✅ Large enough to make meaningful progress
```

This summary provides:
- **Quick overview** of total scope
- **Phase breakdown** with step counts
- **Phase descriptions** (one-line summaries)
- **Step characteristics** (what makes them good steps)

Benefits:
- Helps stakeholders understand scope at a glance
- Shows logical progression through phases
- Demonstrates thoughtful step sizing
- Sets expectations for total effort
