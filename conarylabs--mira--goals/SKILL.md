# Goal Management

Manage goals and milestones that persist across Claude Code sessions.

**Command:** $ARGUMENTS

## Current Goals (Live)

!`mira tool goal '{"action":"list","limit":5}'`

<!-- If the above command fails or returns empty, call mcp__mira__goal with action="list" directly. -->

## Instructions

Parse the command and use the appropriate `mcp__mira__goal` action:

### No arguments or "list"
- The goals are already shown above
- Highlight in-progress and blocked goals

### "add <title>" or "create <title>"
- Use `action="create"` with the title
- Ask for description and priority if not provided
- Suggest adding milestones after creation

### "show <id>" or "progress <id>"
- Use `action="get"` with the goal_id
- Show full details including all milestones
- Display completion status for each milestone

### "milestone <goal_id> <title>"
- Use `action="add_milestone"`
- Add a new milestone to the specified goal
- Ask for weight if not provided (default: 1)

### "complete <milestone_id>"
- Use `action="complete_milestone"`
- Mark the milestone as done
- Show updated goal progress

### "done <goal_id>"
- Use `action="update"` with status="completed"
- Mark the entire goal as complete
