# Mira Insights

## Current Insights (Live)

!`mira tool insights '{"action":"insights","min_confidence":0.5}'`

## Instructions

Present the insights above grouped by source:
- **Pondering**: Background analysis of your work patterns (stale goals, fragile code, revert clusters, untested hotspots)
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing docs that should be written

For each insight show:
- The insight content
- Confidence score (if above threshold)
- When it was generated

If no insights exist, suggest actions that generate them:
- Working on code (triggers pattern detection)
- Making decisions (triggers pondering analysis)
- Using tools consistently (triggers workflow insights)

## Optional Filters

If user passes arguments, use `mcp__mira__insights` tool with filters:
- `--source pondering|doc_gap` → `insight_source` parameter
- `--min-confidence 0.7` → `min_confidence` parameter
