# Session Recap

## Current Context (Live)

!`mira tool session '{"action":"recap"}'`

## Instructions

Present the recap above in a clear, organized format:
- **Preferences**: User coding style, tool preferences
- **Recent Context**: What was worked on recently
- **Active Goals**: In-progress goals with milestones

Highlight any blocked or high-priority items. If the recap above is empty, suggest creating goals with `goal(action="create")` or using `session(action="recap")` directly to check for prior context.

## When to Use

- Starting a new session
- Resuming after a break
- When context about previous work is needed
- User asks "what were we working on?"
