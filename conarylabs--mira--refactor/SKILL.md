# Safe Refactoring

> **Requires:** Claude Code Agent Teams feature.

Architect-planned, reviewer-validated code restructuring with per-step compilation checks.

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Parse arguments** (optional):
   - Any text -> use as the refactoring goal/context for the architect

2. **Determine context**: What code to refactor, the goal of the restructuring, and any constraints. If no context is obvious, ask the user what they'd like refactored.

---

### Phase 1: Analysis

3. **Launch for analysis**: Call the Mira `launch` MCP tool to get the architect agent spec:
   ```
   launch(team="refactor-team", scope=user_context, members="atlas")
   ```

4. **Create the team**:
   ```
   TeamCreate(team_name=result.data.suggested_team_id)
   ```

5. **Create and assign** the analysis task:
   ```
   TaskCreate(subject=atlas_agent.task_subject, description=atlas_agent.task_description)
   TaskUpdate(taskId=id, owner="atlas", status="in_progress")
   ```

6. **Spawn Atlas (architect)** using `Task` tool:
   ```
   Task(
     subagent_type="general-purpose",
     name="atlas",
     model=atlas_agent.model,
     team_name=result.data.suggested_team_id,
     prompt=atlas_agent.prompt + "\n\n## Refactoring Goal\n\n" + user_context,
     run_in_background=true
   )
   ```
   IMPORTANT: Do NOT use `mode="bypassPermissions"` -- Atlas is read-only.
   IMPORTANT: Always pass model="sonnet" to the Task tool. This ensures read-only agents use a cost-efficient model.

7. **Wait** for Atlas to report via SendMessage.

---

### Phase 2: Validation

8. **Launch for validation**: Call `launch` to get the reviewer agent spec:
   ```
   launch(team="refactor-team", scope=user_context, members="iris")
   ```

9. **Spawn Iris (safety reviewer)** using `Task` tool:
   ```
   Task(
     subagent_type="general-purpose",
     name="iris",
     model=iris_agent.model,
     team_name=result.data.suggested_team_id,
     prompt=iris_agent.prompt + "\n\n## Refactoring Plan\n\n" + atlas_plan,
     run_in_background=true
   )
   ```
   IMPORTANT: Do NOT use `mode="bypassPermissions"` -- Iris is read-only.
   IMPORTANT: Always pass model="sonnet" to the Task tool. This ensures read-only agents use a cost-efficient model.

10. **Send Atlas's plan** to Iris via `SendMessage` so she has the specific plan to validate.

11. **Create and assign** the validation task.

12. **Wait** for Iris to report via SendMessage. Then shut down both analyst agents.

---

### Phase 3: Synthesis

13. **Combine** Atlas's plan with Iris's feedback:
    - If Iris found missing callers or risks, incorporate them
    - If rated "needs revision" or "too risky", revise accordingly

14. **Present** the validated refactoring plan to the user and **WAIT for approval**.

---

### Phase 4: Implementation

15. **Execute the refactoring steps** yourself. For each step:
    - Make the changes
    - Run `cargo test --no-run` to verify compilation (NEVER use --release)
    - If it doesn't compile, fix before moving to the next step

16. For **large refactors** (5+ files), launch implementation agents:
    ```
    launch(team="refactor-team", scope=implementation_plan, members="ash")
    ```
    Spawn implementation agents with `mode="bypassPermissions"`:
    - Group steps by file ownership to avoid conflicts
    - Max 3 steps per agent
    - Each agent verifies with `cargo test --no-run`

---

### Phase 5: Verification

17. **Launch for verification**: Call `launch` to get the verifier agent spec:
    ```
    launch(team="refactor-team", scope=summary_of_changes, members="ash")
    ```

18. **Spawn Ash (build verifier)** using `Task` tool:
    ```
    Task(
      subagent_type="general-purpose",
      name="ash",
      model=ash_agent.model,
      team_name=result.data.suggested_team_id,
      prompt=ash_agent.prompt + "\n\n## Changes Made\n\n" + summary_of_changes,
      run_in_background=true,
      mode="bypassPermissions"
    )
    ```

19. **Wait** for Ash to report. If tests fail: fix regressions or update test imports/paths.

---

### Phase 6: Finalize

20. **Report** summary of structural changes to the user.
21. **Cleanup**: Send `shutdown_request` to remaining agents, then `TeamDelete`.

## Examples

```
/mira:refactor
-> Prompts for what to refactor, then runs the full analysis -> validation -> implementation cycle

/mira:refactor Split the database module into separate files per concern
-> Atlas analyzes the DB module, plans the split, Iris validates, then implements

/mira:refactor Rename the "watcher" module to "file_monitor" across the codebase
-> Safe rename with caller analysis and per-step compilation checks
```

## Agent Roles

| Phase | Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Analysis | Atlas (architect) | Map current structure, design target, plan migration steps |
| Validation | Iris (safety reviewer) | Verify completeness, check for hidden behavior changes |
| Verification | Ash (build verifier) | Run tests, compilation, linters between steps |
