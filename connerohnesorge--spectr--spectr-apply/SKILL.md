# Change Proposal Application/Acceptance Process

## Guardrails

- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only
  when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `spectr/AGENTS.md` and `spectr/project.md` (located inside
  the `spectr/` directory—run `ls spectr`) for project and
  Spectr conventions or clarifications.

## Steps

Track these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.

1. Run `spectr accept <id>` to convert `tasks.md` to `tasks.jsonc` format for
   stable task tracking. Note: Both `tasks.md` (human-readable source) and
   `tasks.jsonc` (runtime source of truth) coexist after accept—update task
   statuses in `tasks.jsonc`.
2. Read `spectr/changes/<id>/proposal.md`, `design.md` (if present), and
   `tasks.jsonc` to confirm scope and acceptance criteria.
3. Work through tasks sequentially, keeping edits minimal and focused on the
   requested change. Update the task status in `tasks.jsonc` after verifying
   the work.
4. Confirm completion before updating statuses—make sure every item in
   `tasks.jsonc` is finished.
5. Verify/Update all task status in `tasks.jsonc` after all work is done. Tasks
   have status values: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`.
6. Read `spectr/changes/` and `spectr/specs/` directories when additional
   context is required.

## Reference

- Read `spectr/changes/<id>/proposal.md` for proposal details.
- Read `spectr/changes/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` for delta specs.
