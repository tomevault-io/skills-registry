# Git Sync Skill

Automatically synchronize local changes to GitHub repository with intelligent commit messages and safe push operations.

## When to Use

This skill triggers when:
- User says "coding is done" or "sync git"
- Significant coding work is completed
- User explicitly requests to commit and push changes

## Workflow

### 1. Check Repository Status

First, check what has changed:

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
```

Review the changes to understand what was modified.

### 2. Stage Changes

**Important:** Be selective about what to stage. Avoid staging:
- Sensitive files (.env, credentials, secrets)
- Large binary files unnecessarily
- Temporary or cache files

Stage specific files by name:

```bash
git add <file1> <file2> <file3>
```

For related groups of files, you may use:

```bash
git add <directory>/*.py
git add trackatool/app/
```

**Only use `git add -A` or `git add .` if you've verified all changes should be committed.**

### 3. Create Descriptive Commit Message

Generate a commit message that:
- Starts with a verb (Add, Update, Fix, Refactor, etc.)
- Summarizes the changes concisely
- Focuses on "why" rather than "what"
- Includes Co-Authored-By line

Example format:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Add Flask application structure for TIE tracker

- Implement authentication system with Flask-Login
- Create dashboard with job statistics
- Add job tracking and service history views
- Configure SQL Server 2019 connection

EOF
)"
```

### 4. Push to Remote

**Safety check:** Before pushing, verify:
- You're on the correct branch
- The remote is correct
- No force push is needed

```bash
# Check current branch and remote
git branch --show-current
git remote -v

# Push changes
git push
```

If the branch doesn't track a remote yet:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

## Safety Guidelines

### Do NOT:
- Use `--force` or `--force-with-lease` unless explicitly requested
- Push to main/master branch without verification
- Skip hooks with `--no-verify` unless explicitly requested
- Commit sensitive files (.env, credentials, API keys)
- Create empty commits when there are no changes

### DO:
- Review `git status` and `git diff` before staging
- Stage files selectively by name when possible
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Include Co-Authored-By attribution
- Check for pre-commit hook failures and fix issues
- Create NEW commits after hook failures (not amend)

## Error Handling

### Pre-commit Hook Failure

If a pre-commit hook fails, the commit did NOT happen. Fix the issue and create a NEW commit:

```bash
# Fix the issues reported by the hook
# Then stage and commit again (do NOT use --amend)
git add <fixed-files>
git commit -m "message"
```

### Push Rejected (Non-fast-forward)

If push is rejected, pull first:

```bash
git pull --rebase
git push
```

### Authentication Issues

If authentication fails, verify credentials or SSH keys are configured correctly.

## Example Usage

**Scenario:** User completes Flask application implementation

```bash
# 1. Check status
git status
git diff --stat

# 2. Stage files
git add trackatool/app/*.py
git add trackatool/requirements.txt
git add trackatool/README.md

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Implement complete Flask application for repair tracking

- Add SQLAlchemy models for 7 database tables
- Create authentication system with Flask-Login
- Build dashboard with job statistics
- Implement job tracking and service history views
- Add technical library search functionality
- Create repair request submission form

EOF
)"

# 4. Push to remote
git push
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

After using this skill:
- Verify the commit appears on GitHub
- Check that CI/CD pipelines pass (if configured)
- Inform the user of successful sync with commit SHA
