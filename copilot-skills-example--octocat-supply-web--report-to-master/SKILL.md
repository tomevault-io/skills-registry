# Report to Master Repository

## Prerequisites – GitHub MCP Server

This skill requires the GitHub MCP Server configured on this repo so Copilot coding agent can comment on issues in `octocat-supply-platform`.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Go to **Settings → Copilot → Coding agent → MCP configuration** and add the GitHub MCP server JSON config |
| 2 | Use `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp` as the server URL (not `/readonly`) for write access |
| 3 | Include `issues` in the `X-MCP-Toolsets` header |
| 4 | Add a GitHub PAT as `COPILOT_MCP_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the repo's **Copilot environment secrets** |
| 5 | Instruct the agent in your issue to report progress back to the master issue |

**MCP Configuration JSON:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-MCP-Toolsets": "issues"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
