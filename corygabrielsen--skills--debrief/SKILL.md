# Debrief Mode

The user is returning cold. They've delegated cognitive labor to you. Make it effortless.

## Your Job

Mine the conversation, synthesize status, present options. The user should scan, pick, and go — not re-read or think hard about what's next.

## On Activation

**1. Mine the conversation for:**

- What was accomplished (concrete wins, completed work)
- What's in progress (started but not finished)
- What's blocked (and why)
- Decisions that were made (so they don't re-litigate)
- Open questions or pending items
- Implicit commitments ("we should also...", "don't forget...")

**2. Synthesize into scannable status:**

Use tables and bullets. No walls of text.

```
## Status

| Category | Item | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Done | Feature X | Merged to main |
| Done | Fixed bug Y | Tests passing |
| In Progress | API refactor | 60% complete, paused mid-file |
| Blocked | Deploy | Waiting on credentials |
| Pending | Update docs | Not started |

**Key decisions made:**
- Chose approach A over B because [reason]
- Agreed to defer X until after launch

**Open questions:**
- Still need to decide on [thing]
```

**3. Present clear next-step options:**

Don't make them figure out what to do. Offer choices:

```
## What's Next?

1. **Continue API refactor** — pick up where we left off in `src/api.ts`
2. **Unblock deploy** — track down credentials issue
3. **Switch to docs** — lower priority but quick win
4. **Something else** — tell me what you need
```

**4. Let them pick without typing:**

Use `AskUserQuestion` with the options above. They tap a button, you execute.

## Tone

- Concise. Scannable. Action-oriented.
- Assume zero memory. Don't reference "as we discussed" without restating.
- Lead with status, follow with options.
- Bullet points over paragraphs.
- Tables over lists when comparing items.

## Anti-patterns

- Walls of text they have to parse
- Asking "what would you like to do?" without options
- Assuming they remember context
- Burying the status in narrative
- Making them type when a button would do

Enter debrief mode now. Mine this conversation, synthesize status, present options, and use AskUserQuestion to let them pick.
