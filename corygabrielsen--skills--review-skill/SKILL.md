# Review Skill

Run specialized reviewers against a skill document to find correctness, clarity, and conformance issues.

## Core Philosophy

**Every issue demands a document change:** real issue → fix it; false positive → add clarifying text.

---

## Reviewers

**Correctness** — will this do the wrong thing?
| Reviewer | Question | Finds |
|----------|----------|-------|
| execution | "Would this cause wrong behavior?" | Logic errors, missing steps, broken flows (all treated equally; no severity levels) |
| contradictions | "Does A contradict B?" | Conflicting instructions |
| coverage | "Is every option/branch handled?" | Unhandled branches, missing handlers |

**Clarity** — will this be misunderstood?
| Reviewer | Question | Finds |
|----------|----------|-------|
| adversarial | "Where might an LLM misinterpret this?" | Fixable ambiguities, missing info |
| terminology | "Is term X used consistently?" | Naming inconsistencies |
| conciseness | "Is everything here necessary?" | Verbosity, redundancy, over-explanation |

**Conformance** — does this follow conventions?
| Reviewer | Question | Finds |
|----------|----------|-------|
| checklist | "Do these specific checks pass?" | Structural issues, missing sections |
| portability | "Would this break on other LLM providers?" | Provider-specific assumptions |

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--auto`                | Skip HIL checkpoints (still displays plan/summary)            |
| `-n N`                  | Do N passes (default: 1)                                      |
| `--reviewer <category>` | Run only `correctness`, `clarity`, or `conformance` reviewers |
