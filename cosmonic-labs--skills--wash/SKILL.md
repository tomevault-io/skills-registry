# wash - wasmCloud Shell

This skill provides expertise in using the wasmCloud Shell (wash) CLI tool for developing and managing WebAssembly components and wasmCloud applications.

## Prerequisites

- `wash` version 2.0.0 or later (including release candidates like 2.0.0-rc.X)
- Verify version with: `wash --version`

## Important Notes

**Do not use `cargo component` commands** (like `cargo component build`) when working with wasmCloud projects. Always use `wash` commands instead:
- Use `wash build` or `wash dev` for building components
- For plugins, build with `wash build --skip-fetch` (since wasmcloud:wash interface isn't published)

## Core Commands

### wash dev

Use `wash dev` for local development and build loop. This command:
- Automatically rebuilds your component on file changes
- Provides a fast iteration cycle during development
- Watches for changes and recompiles as needed

Example:
```bash
wash dev
```

### wash wit update

Use `wash wit update` when there are mismatched WIT (WebAssembly Interface Types) definitions. This command:
- Updates WIT dependencies to resolve conflicts
- Synchronizes WIT definitions across your project
- Fixes version mismatches in component interfaces

Example:
```bash
wash wit update
```

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Project

1. Initialize your project with `wash new https://github.com/cosmonic-labs/<TEMPLATE> --name my-project`
2. `cd my-project`
3. Run `wash build` to build the code
4. Make changes to your code

### Fixing WIT Definition Conflicts

If you encounter errors about mismatched WIT definitions:

1. Run `wash wit update` to synchronize definitions
2. Review the updated WIT files
3. Continue with `wash build`

## Additional Resources

- wash is the primary CLI tool for the wasmCloud ecosystem
- It handles component building, testing, and deployment
- Supports both local development and production workflows
