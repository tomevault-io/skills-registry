# Claude MD

**Complete CLAUDE.md management:** Audit, Review, Improve, Refactor, Update, and Generate. Core insight: rules with reasoning outperform bare rules. Models generalize from "why" explanations.

## Quick Reference

| Mode | When to Use | Output |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Audit** | "Audit CLAUDE.md", "Check all my rule files" | Discovery + quality scores for all files |
| **Review** | "Review my CLAUDE.md", "Check instruction quality" | Detailed quality report + improvement suggestions |
| **Improve** | "Improve my rules", "Fix my CLAUDE.md" | Targeted updates with diffs |
| **Refactor** | "Organize Claude config", "Split CLAUDE.md" | Restructured files with progressive disclosure |
| **Update** | "Update CLAUDE.md", "Sync my rules", "Init project" | CLAUDE.md synced with current codebase state |
| **Generate** | "Generate subdirectory context", "Create package CLAUDE.md files" | New CLAUDE.md files for directories that need context |

### Mode Sequencing

Modes can be combined in workflows:

| Sequence | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Audit → Generate** | Audit finds gaps in subdirectory coverage → Generate creates missing files |
| **Audit → Review → Improve** | Full assessment → quality check → targeted fixes |
| **Update → Review** | Sync with codebase → check quality of synced content |
| **Update → Improve** | Sync with codebase → fix reasoning and specificity gaps |
| **Generate → Review** | Create new files → verify quality meets standards |
| **Improve → Refactor** | Fix issues → restructure if still bloated |

**Generate as follow-up:** After running Audit, if subdirectories lack context files, Generate mode can create them. Generate reuses Phase 1 discovery if Audit was already run in the same session.

---

## Workflow Overview

<instructions>

### Phase 1: Discovery

Find all CLAUDE.md files in the repository:

```bash
find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -o -name ".claude.md" -o -name ".claude.local.md" 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

**File Types & Locations:**

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Project root | `./CLAUDE.md` | Primary project context |
| Local overrides | `./.claude.local.md` | Personal/local settings (gitignored) |
| Global defaults | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User-wide defaults across all projects |
| Package-specific | `./packages/*/CLAUDE.md` | Module-level context in monorepos |
| Subdirectory | Any nested location | Feature/domain-specific context |
| Rules directory | `./.claude/rules/*.md` | Auto-loaded detailed rules |
| Reference docs | `./.claude/reference/*.md` | Large docs (NOT auto-loaded) |

**Note:** Claude auto-discovers CLAUDE.md files in parent directories, making monorepo setups work automatically.

### Phase 2: Quality Assessment

For each CLAUDE.md file, evaluate against quality criteria.

**Quick Assessment Checklist (100 points total):**

| Criterion | Points | Check |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Commands/workflows | 12 | Are build/test/deploy commands present? |
| Architecture clarity | 12 | Can Claude understand the codebase structure? |
| Non-obvious patterns | 10 | Are gotchas and quirks documented? |
| Conciseness | 8 | No verbose explanations or obvious info? |
| Currency | 8 | Does it reflect current codebase state? |
| **Content Quality** | **50** | See sub-criteria below |

**Content Quality Sub-Criteria (50 points):**

| Sub-criterion | Points | Check |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Reasoning presence | 15 | Do rules explain "why"? Hybrid style: "Prefer X—it provides Y" |
| Actionability | 10 | No vague language without defaults? Executable instructions? |
| Degrees of freedom | 10 | Rigid for safety, flexible for style? Matches consequence? |
| Options discipline | 5 | Default + escape hatch? Max 3 alternatives? |
| AI-optimized format | 10 | Tables, examples, code blocks over prose walls? |

**Quality Grades:**
- **A (90-100)**: Comprehensive, current, actionable
- **B (70-89)**: Good coverage, minor gaps
- **C (50-69)**: Basic info, missing key sections
- **D (30-49)**: Sparse or outdated
- **F (0-29)**: Missing or severely outdated

<example>
**Audit mode summary output:**

```markdown
## CLAUDE.md Audit Summary

- Files found: 4
- Average score: 72/100 (Grade B)
- Files needing update: 2

| File | Score | Grade | Key Issue |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|
| ./CLAUDE.md | 88/100 | B | Missing gotchas section |
| .claude/rules/coding.md | 91/100 | A | No issues |
| packages/api/CLAUDE.md | 54/100 | C | No commands, vague patterns |
| packages/shared/CLAUDE.md | 56/100 | C | Rules lack reasoning |
```
</example>

**Rule Quality Dimensions (for Review mode):**

| Dimension | Score | Criteria | Applies To |
|-----------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Reasoning** | 0-3 | 0=no why, 1=some, 2=most, 3=all have reasoning | Rules, Patterns, Conventions only |
| **Specificity** | 0-3 | 0=vague, 1=mixed, 2=mostly specific, 3=all actionable | Rules, Patterns, Gotchas |
| **Positive framing** | 0-3 | 0=all negative, 1=mostly negative, 2=mixed, 3=mostly positive | Rules only |
| **Examples** | 0-2 | 0=none, 1=some, 2=good/bad examples | Complex rules/patterns |
| **Structure** | 0-2 | 0=prose wall, 1=basic headers, 2=tables/hierarchy | All content |
| **Conflicts** | 0/-3 | 0=none, -1 per conflict found | All content |

**What needs reasoning vs what doesn't:**

| Section Type | Needs Reasoning? | Example |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Context/Description | No | "Stripe integration for subscriptions" — factual |
| Key Files | No | "`stripe.ts` - Stripe client" — factual |
| Architecture | No | Directory structure — factual |
| Commands | No | "`pnpm test`" — executable |
| **Rules/Hard Rules** | Yes | "Never commit secrets — in history forever" |
| **Patterns/Conventions** | Yes | "One route per file — keeps routing predictable" |
| **Gotchas** | Sometimes | Only if non-obvious why it's a gotcha |

### Phase 3: Quality Report Output

Output the quality report before making any updates.

**Report Format:**

<example>
```markdown
## CLAUDE.md Quality Report

### Summary
- Files found: X
- Average score: X/100
- Files needing update: X

### File-by-File Assessment

#### 1. ./CLAUDE.md (Project Root)
**Score: XX/100 (Grade: X)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Commands/workflows | X/12 | ... |
| Architecture clarity | X/12 | ... |
| Non-obvious patterns | X/10 | ... |
| Conciseness | X/8 | ... |
| Currency | X/8 | ... |
| Content Quality | X/50 | ... |

*Content Quality breakdown:*
| Sub-criterion | Score |
|---------------|-------|
| Reasoning presence | X/15 |
| Actionability | X/10 |
| Degrees of freedom | X/10 |
| Options discipline | X/5 |
| AI-optimized format | X/10 |

**Issues:**
- [List specific problems]

**Recommended additions:**
- [List what should be added]
```
</example>

### Phase 4: Issue Detection (Review Mode)

**Check rules and patterns for:** (not factual context sections)

| Issue Type | Detection | Example Problem | Applies To |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Missing reasoning** | No "why", "because", explanation | "Never use any" (why?) | Rules, Patterns |
| **Vague instruction** | Not actionable, no concrete guidance | "Write clean code" | Rules, Patterns |
| **Negative-only framing** | "Don't", "Never", "Avoid" without positive alternative | "Don't hardcode URLs" | Rules only |
| **No examples** | Abstract rule without concrete illustration | Complex patterns need examples | Complex rules |
| **Conflicts** | Two rules that contradict | "Use Jest" + "Use Vitest" | All |
| **Redundant** | Duplicates another rule | Same instruction in two places | All |
| **Obvious** | Model does this without instruction | "Use correct syntax" | Rules |
| **Stale commands** | Build commands that no longer work | Outdated paths or scripts | Commands |
| **Missing dependencies** | Required tools not mentioned | Setup requirements omitted | Environment |

**Do NOT flag as issues:**
- Context sections without "why" (factual descriptions don't need reasoning)
- Key Files without explanations (file path + purpose is sufficient)
- Architecture sections without justification (structure is factual)

### Phase 5: Targeted Updates (Improve Mode)

After outputting the quality report, ask user for confirmation before updating.

**Update Guidelines (Critical):**

1. **Propose targeted additions only** - Focus on genuinely useful info:
   - Commands or workflows discovered during analysis
   - Gotchas or non-obvious patterns found in code
   - Package relationships that weren't clear
   - Testing approaches that work
   - Configuration quirks

2. **Keep it minimal** - Avoid:
   - Restating what's obvious from the code
   - Generic best practices already covered
   - One-off fixes unlikely to recur
   - Verbose explanations when a one-liner suffices

3. **Show diffs** - For each change, show:
   - Which CLAUDE.md file to update
   - The specific addition (as a diff or quoted block)
   - Brief explanation of why this helps future sessions

**Diff Format:**

<example>
```markdown
### Update: ./CLAUDE.md

**Why:** Build command was missing, causing confusion about how to run the project.

```diff
+ ## Quick Start
+
+ ```bash
+ npm install
+ npm run dev  # Start development server on port 3000
+ ```
```
```
</example>

### Phase 6: Refactoring (Refactor Mode)

For bloated files, restructure using progressive disclosure.

**Triage Assessment:**

| Signal | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Already uses `.claude/rules/` structure | +2 |
| Has clear hierarchy (headers, tables) | +1 |
| Contains reasoning ("why" explanations) | +1 |
| Rules are actionable and specific | +1 |
| Under 200 lines with dense content | +1 |
| Over 300 lines | -1 |
| Wall-of-text without structure | -2 |
| Contains contradictions | -2 |
| Mix of vague and specific rules | -1 |

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 4+ | **Skip** — already well-organized |
| 2-3 | **Light** — extract verbose sections |
| 0-1 | **Standard** — full refactoring |
| Negative | **Deep** — significant restructuring |

<example>
**Refactor triage output:**

```markdown
## Triage: ./CLAUDE.md (380 lines)

| Signal | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Uses `.claude/rules/` | 0 |
| Clear hierarchy | +1 |
| Has reasoning | 0 |
| Actionable rules | +1 |
| Length | -1 (>300) |
| Wall-of-text | -2 |

**Total: -1 → Decision: Standard refactoring**

Plan: Extract coding rules to `.claude/rules/coding.md`, add reasoning to bare directives, move testing patterns to `.claude/rules/testing.md`.
```
</example>

**Keep in root (high-value, frequently referenced):**

| Category | Example | Why Keep |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Project description | "React dashboard for analytics" | Sets context for all tasks |
| Commands | `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` | Used every session |
| Hard rules with reasoning | "Never commit secrets — in git history forever" | Safety reinforcement |
| Core principles (3-5) | "Type safety first", "Test behavior not implementation" | Philosophy that guides decisions |
| Priority hierarchy | "Safety > Core Principles > Style" | Conflict resolution |
| Critical @rules references | `@rules/safety.md` | Loads detailed content |

**Extract to `.claude/rules/` (detailed, topic-specific):**
- Detailed language conventions with examples
- Extensive testing patterns
- Framework-specific guidance
- Comprehensive workflow documentation
- Reference tables and checklists

**Output structure:**
```
project-root/
├── CLAUDE.md                     # High-value content with @references
└── .claude/
    ├── rules/                    # Auto-loaded by Claude Code
    │   ├── coding.md
    │   ├── testing.md
    │   ├── workflow.md
    │   └── safety.md
    └── reference/                # NOT auto-loaded (search-triggered)
        └── patterns.md
```

### Phase 7: Apply Updates

After user approval, apply changes using the Edit tool. Preserve existing content structure.

### Mode: Update (Sync CLAUDE.md with Codebase)

**Triggers:** "Update CLAUDE.md", "Sync my rules", "Init project", "Refresh project context"

Scans the codebase and updates CLAUDE.md to reflect the current project state. Creates a CLAUDE.md from scratch if none exists. Unlike Improve (which fixes quality issues), Update detects drift between the documented state and the actual codebase.

| Phase | Action | Detail |
|-------|--------|--------|
| U1 | Codebase Scan | Detect package manager, scripts/commands, directory structure, frameworks, config files, environment vars. |
| U2 | Existing CLAUDE.md Read | Read current CLAUDE.md (if any). If none exists, treat all discovered info as new. |
| U3 | Drift Detection | Compare documented state against discovered state. Flag stale commands, missing sections, outdated structure, removed files. |
| U4 | Change Preview | Show additions, updates, and removals as a diff. Never auto-apply. |
| U5 | User Approval | Present changes for approval. Support approve all, select specific, or cancel. |
| U6 | Apply Updates | Write approved changes. Preserve existing reasoning, rules, and user-authored content. |

**Key principle:** Update adds and corrects factual content (commands, structure, files). It never removes or rewrites user-authored rules, reasoning, or principles unless they reference things that no longer exist.

See [references/update-workflow.md](references/update-workflow.md) for the full scanning algorithm, detection heuristics, and framework-specific patterns.

<example>
**Update mode preview output:**

```markdown
## CLAUDE.md Update Preview

**Codebase scan results:** Node.js project, pnpm, Next.js 15, TypeScript

### Additions (new sections)
+ ## Commands
+ | `pnpm dev` | Start dev server |
+ | `pnpm build` | Production build |
+ | `pnpm test` | Run vitest |
+ | `pnpm lint` | ESLint check |

+ ## Architecture
+ src/app/        # Next.js app router pages
+ src/lib/        # Shared utilities
+ src/components/ # React components

### Updates (changed content)
~ ## Key Files
~ - `src/lib/db.ts` → renamed to `src/lib/database.ts`
~ - Removed reference to deleted `src/utils/legacy.ts`

### No changes
= ## Hard Rules (unchanged, user-authored)
= ## Core Principles (unchanged, user-authored)

Apply these changes? [All / Select / Cancel]
```
</example>

### Mode: Generate (Create Subdirectory Context)

**Triggers:** "Generate subdirectory context", "Create CLAUDE.md for packages", "Add directory context files"

**Workflow:** Scan directories, score by "needs context" heuristics, generate minimal CLAUDE.md files for high-value directories, get user approval before creating any files.

| Phase | Action | Detail |
|-------|--------|--------|
| G1 | Directory Discovery | Scan structure, skip `node_modules`, `dist`, `.git`, etc. Reuse Audit discovery if already run. |
| G2 | Directory Scoring | Score each directory (file count, entry points, naming clarity, monorepo signals). Threshold: >=6 full, 4-5 minimal, <4 skip. |
| G3 | Content Extraction | Extract purpose, key files, patterns, dependencies, gotchas from each candidate. |
| G4 | Preview Generation | Show proposed files with scores and content. |
| G5 | User Approval | Present options: approve all, select specific, modify, or cancel. Never auto-create. |
| G6 | File Creation | Write approved files. Verify: starts with `@../CLAUDE.md`, under 500 tokens, no root duplication. |

See [references/generation-workflow.md](references/generation-workflow.md) for the full scoring algorithm, extraction heuristics, and framework-specific guidance.

<example>
**Generate mode preview output:**

```markdown
## Proposed Subdirectory CLAUDE.md Files

### 1. src/api/CLAUDE.md (Score: 7)
**Reason:** 23 files, has index.ts, API domain

**Content:**
# API Layer

@../CLAUDE.md

## Context
Express routes with Zod validation. All routes require auth middleware.

## Key Files
- `index.ts` - Route registration
- `middleware/auth.ts` - JWT validation

## Patterns
- One route file per resource — keeps routing predictable
- Validation schemas co-located with routes — easier to maintain

## Gotchas
- Rate limiting applies per-user, not per-IP
```
</example>
