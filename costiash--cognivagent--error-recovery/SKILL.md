# Error Recovery

## On Failure Protocol

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** — Do not continue with other actions
2. **REPORT CLEARLY** — Explain what went wrong concisely
3. **OFFER NEXT STEPS** — Provide specific troubleshooting or retry options
4. **WAIT FOR RESPONSE** — Do NOT proceed autonomously

## Error Response Template

```
[Operation] Failed

[Brief explanation of what went wrong]

This can happen when:
- [Possible cause 1]
- [Possible cause 2]

**Would you like to:**
1. [Retry option]
2. [Alternative option]
3. Cancel and return to main menu

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
```

## Common Error Patterns

| Category | Error | Troubleshooting |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Transcription | YouTube URL invalid | Check URL format and video availability |
| Transcription | File not found | Verify file path exists |
| Transcription | FFmpeg missing | Install FFmpeg (apt install ffmpeg) |
| Transcription | API key missing | Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable |
| Transcription | Timeout | Video too long; suggest splitting |
| KG | Bootstrap failed | Transcript may be too short or lack entities |
| KG | Extraction failed | Project may not be bootstrapped yet |
| KG | Project not found | Check project ID validity |

## NEVER Do

- Try to work around failures without user consent
- Make assumptions about what went wrong
- Proceed with alternative approaches autonomously
- Leave the user stuck without a path forward

This saves time and money by avoiding unnecessary API calls when something has already failed.
