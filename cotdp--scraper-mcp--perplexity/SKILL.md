# Perplexity AI Skill

AI-powered web search and reasoning capabilities via the scraper MCP server.

## When to Use This Skill

- Searching the web with AI-synthesized answers
- Research tasks requiring multiple sources with citations
- Complex reasoning and multi-step analysis
- Questions about current events or real-time information
- Comparing options or analyzing trade-offs

## Available Tools

| Tool | Model | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| `mcp__scraper__perplexity` | sonar | General queries, quick searches, factual lookups |
| `mcp__scraper__perplexity_reason` | sonar-reasoning-pro | Complex analysis, comparisons, multi-step reasoning |

## Tool Usage

### 1. General Web Search

For straightforward queries and information lookup:

```
mcp__scraper__perplexity(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are the latest features in Next.js 15?"}
    ],
    model="sonar",
    temperature=0.3,
    max_tokens=4000
)
```

**Response includes:**
- `content`: AI-synthesized answer with citation markers [1], [2], etc.
- `citations`: Array of source URLs
- `model`: Model used
- `usage`: Token statistics

### 2. Complex Reasoning

For analytical queries requiring deep thinking:

```
mcp__scraper__perplexity_reason(
    query="Compare React Server Components vs traditional SSR approaches. Consider performance, developer experience, and migration complexity.",
    temperature=0.3,
    max_tokens=4000
)
```

**Use cases:**
- Technology comparisons
- Architecture decisions
- Trade-off analysis
- Multi-factor evaluations

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `messages` | array | required | Conversation history (perplexity only) |
| `query` | string | required | Question to reason about (perplexity_reason only) |
| `model` | string | "sonar" | "sonar" or "sonar-pro" |
| `temperature` | number | 0.3 | Creativity 0-2 (lower = more focused) |
| `max_tokens` | integer | 4000 | Maximum response length |

## Conversation Format

The `perplexity` tool accepts conversation history:

```
mcp__scraper__perplexity(
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a technical advisor."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What database should I use for a real-time chat app?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "For real-time chat, consider..."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "How does Redis compare to PostgreSQL for this use case?"}
    ]
)
```

## Example Use Cases

### Technology Research

```
mcp__scraper__perplexity(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are the best practices for implementing authentication in Next.js 15 App Router?"}
    ]
)
```

### Current Events

```
mcp__scraper__perplexity(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are the latest AI model releases in 2025?"}
    ]
)
```

### Product Comparison

```
mcp__scraper__perplexity_reason(
    query="Compare Vercel, Netlify, and AWS Amplify for deploying Next.js applications. Consider pricing, features, performance, and developer experience."
)
```

### Architecture Decisions

```
mcp__scraper__perplexity_reason(
    query="Should I use a monorepo or polyrepo structure for a microservices architecture? Consider team size of 15 developers, 8 services, and CI/CD complexity."
)
```

### Code Pattern Research

```
mcp__scraper__perplexity(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the recommended way to handle form validation in React 19 with server actions?"}
    ]
)
```

### Security Research

```
mcp__scraper__perplexity_reason(
    query="Analyze the security implications of storing JWT tokens in localStorage vs httpOnly cookies. Consider XSS, CSRF, and token refresh patterns."
)
```

## Best Practices

### Choose the Right Tool

- **perplexity**: Factual queries, lookups, simple questions
- **perplexity_reason**: Comparisons, trade-offs, complex analysis

### Temperature Settings

```
# Factual accuracy (recommended for most queries)
temperature=0.3

# More creative/exploratory responses
temperature=0.7

# Maximum creativity (use sparingly)
temperature=1.0
```

### Working with Citations

Responses include numbered citations [1], [2], etc. matching URLs in the `citations` array:

```json
{
    "content": "Next.js 15 introduces several features [1] including improved caching [2]...",
    "citations": [
        "https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15",
        "https://nextjs.org/docs/caching"
    ]
}
```

### Iterative Research

Build on previous answers:

```
# Initial query
mcp__scraper__perplexity(messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is Zustand?"}
])

# Follow-up with context
mcp__scraper__perplexity(messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is Zustand?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Zustand is a state management library..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How does it compare to Redux Toolkit for a medium-sized application?"}
])
```

## Requirements

The Perplexity tools require `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` environment variable to be set on the scraper MCP server. Without it, these tools will not be available.
