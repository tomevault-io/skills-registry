## Questions File Format

ALL discovery questions MUST be saved to a `.claude-questions/` file using the `/question` skill.

Wait for user to edit the file before proceeding.
</workflow-reminder>

---

<context>

<project>
RangeLink is a **personal tinkering project** (not official Shopify work). This affects tool choices:
- Use free/personal tools only (no corporate SaaS like Descript)
- See `demo/ASSET-STORAGE.md` for recommended free tools

Key features to potentially showcase:

- Copy links with line/column ranges (e.g., `src/auth.ts#L42C10-L58C25`)
- Automatic paste to AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor AI, Copilot Chat)
- Navigation back to code via clickable links in terminal
- Clipboard-only mode (copy without auto-paste)
- Smart Bind (persistent paste target)
- Jump to Bound Destination
- Rectangular/column selection support
- Hover tooltips showing code preview
  </project>

<keybindings>
Early in discovery, check which keybindings should be covered:

| Keybinding (Mac)    | Command                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Cmd+R Cmd+L`       | Copy Range Link (relative)                 |
| `Cmd+R Cmd+Shift+L` | Copy Range Link (absolute)                 |
| `Cmd+R Cmd+P`       | Copy Portable RangeLink (relative)         |
| `Cmd+R Cmd+Shift+P` | Copy Portable RangeLink (absolute)         |
| `Cmd+R Cmd+C`       | Copy Range Link (clipboard only)           |
| `Cmd+R Cmd+Shift+C` | Copy Range Link (clipboard only, absolute) |
| `Cmd+R Cmd+V`       | Paste Selected Text to Destination         |
| `Cmd+R Cmd+J`       | Jump to Bound Destination                  |

Ask: "Which keybindings should this demo cover?"
</keybindings>

<existing-demos>
Read `demo/README.md` and `demo/01-basic-usage/` to understand the established structure and patterns. New demos must follow this structure.
</existing-demos>

<best-practices>
**Visual Clarity:**
- Use **Command Palette** (`Cmd+Shift+P`) for RangeLink commands - viewers see command names
- Use **Edit menu > Paste** instead of `Cmd+V` when demonstrating manual paste
- Keybindings can be shown as post-recording text overlays

**Recording:**

- Light theme for readability in compressed GIFs
- Font size 16-18px minimum
- Pause 1-2 seconds after key actions

**Demo Structure:**

- Duration: 30-60 seconds (shorter for social media)
- Three-part prompt structure: context -> RangeLink -> question
- Show clear value proposition (time saved, precision gained)
- End with call-to-action (GitHub URL visible 3-5 seconds)

**Navigation/Jump Demo Prep:**

- Before navigating back via link: **clear any existing selection** in the target file
- Before demonstrating Jump: **switch away from bound destination** so jump is visible

**Production Tools:**

- See `demo/ASSET-STORAGE.md` for free tools (Edge TTS, DaVinci Resolve, etc.)
  </best-practices>

<workflow>
You MUST complete all discovery phases before generating any files. Do not skip phases or make assumptions.

**IMPORTANT:** At the start, use `/question` to create a questions file and add ALL discovery questions there. Update the file as you progress through phases.

<discovery-questions>
## Discovery Questions (Phases 1-5)

Add all of the following questions to the questions file at once. The user will answer them, and you'll use the answers to guide phases 6-7.

### Purpose & Audience

1. **Primary goal** - What should viewers do/feel after watching?
   - A) Awareness: "I need this extension"
   - B) Tutorial: "Now I know how to use this"
   - C) Feature showcase: "I didn't know it could do that"

2. **Target audience** - Who is this demo for?
   - A) Developers new to RangeLink
   - B) Existing users discovering advanced features
   - C) Specific persona (describe)

3. **Distribution channel** - Where will this be published?
   - A) GitHub README (above the fold)
   - B) Twitter/social media (15-20s max)
   - C) YouTube/longer content (60s+)
   - D) Blog post / article
   - E) Multiple (list which)

4. **Duration constraint** - How long should the demo be?

   - B) 30-45 seconds (GIF-friendly)
   - C) 45-60 seconds (standard)
   - D) 60-90 seconds (YouTube)

### Feature Focus

5. **Which RangeLink capabilities to highlight?** (can select multiple)
   - A) Basic workflow (select -> copy -> paste)
   - B) Navigation (click link to jump back to code)
   - C) Clipboard-only mode (copy without auto-paste)
   - D) Smart Bind (persistent paste target)
   - E) Jump to Bound Destination
   - F) Hover tooltips (preview code without navigating)
   - G) Multiple destinations in one demo

6. **Which keybindings should be demonstrated?**
   - Reference the keybindings table in context
   - Recommend covering at least: `Cmd+R Cmd+L`, `Cmd+R Cmd+V`, `Cmd+R Cmd+J`

7. **Single feature or workflow?**
   - A) Deep-dive on one capability
   - B) End-to-end workflow showing multiple features

8. **What problem does this demo solve?**
   - Help user articulate the pain point being addressed

### Interaction Style

9. **How should RangeLink features be invoked?**
   - A) **Command Palette only** (`Cmd+Shift+P`) - Recommended for awareness demos, viewers see command names
   - B) **Keybindings with overlay** - Show keystroke overlay tool (e.g., KeyCastr)
   - C) **Hybrid** - Command Palette first, keybindings for repeated actions

10. **How should standard actions be shown?** (e.g., Paste when demonstrating clipboard-only)
    - A) **Edit menu** - Visible on screen, recommended
    - B) **Keybindings** - Faster but invisible

11. **Terminal/destination integration?**
    - A) Claude Code extension
    - B) Claude Code in terminal
    - C) Cursor AI chat
    - D) Copilot Chat
    - E) Generic terminal (cat/echo demo)
    - F) Text editor destination
    - G) Multiple destinations (list which)

12. **Voiceover/audio?**
    - A) Silent (GIF-friendly)
    - B) AI voiceover (see demo/ASSET-STORAGE.md for free tools)
    - C) Background music only
    - D) AI voiceover + background music

### Sample Code & Scenario

13. **Code scenario** - What domain resonates with target audience?
    - A) E-commerce (cart, checkout, discounts)
    - B) Authentication (login, validation, security)
    - C) Payment handling (transactions, errors)
    - D) API endpoints (REST, GraphQL)
    - E) React components (state, props, hooks)
    - F) Other (describe)

14. **File structure?**
    - A) Single file (simpler)
    - B) Two related files (shows cross-file navigation/comparison)
    - C) Multiple files (complex workflow)

15. **What makes the code demo-worthy?**
    - For comparison demos: What's different between files?
    - For single file: What's the interesting part to highlight?
    - Ensure differences are non-trivial (worth asking AI about)

16. **What question/prompt will be asked?**
    - Help craft a natural-sounding prompt that showcases the value
    - Should feel like a real question someone would ask

### Production Quality

17. **Text overlays/narrative style?**
    - A) None (let actions speak)
    - B) Feature-focused callouts ("RangeLink generates precise links")
    - C) First-person developer thoughts ("I need to compare these...")
    - D) Hybrid (developer context + feature highlights)

18. **Pacing style?**
    - A) Snappy/fast (social media)
    - B) Deliberate/educational (tutorial)
    - C) Natural/realistic (authenticity)

19. **Call-to-action?** - A) GitHub URL (github.com/couimet/rangeLink) - B) Marketplace link - C) "Search for RangeLink in extensions" - D) None
    </discovery-questions>

<phase id="6-flow">
## Phase 6: Detailed Flow Formalization

**CRITICAL:** Before generating files, create a detailed timestamped flow in the questions file.

Format each step as:

```
STEP N [X:XX-X:XX]: STEP NAME
- Action 1
- Action 2
- Narrative: "Text overlay or voiceover line"
```

**Important considerations:**

- Group steps into Acts (logical sections)
- Include prep steps (e.g., "clear selection before navigation demo")
- For Jump demo: include "switch away from bound destination" step
- For Navigation demo: include "clear selection" step
- Estimate total duration and compare to target

**Example structure:**

```
### Act 1: Setup & First Link (0:00-0:15)
STEP 1 [0:00-0:03]: SETUP
- Show file open, terminal visible
- Narrative: "I'm working on..."

STEP 2 [0:03-0:08]: CREATE FIRST LINK
- Select code block
- Cmd+Shift+P -> "RangeLink: Copy Range Link"
- Narrative: "RangeLink captures the exact location..."
```

Present the flow for user approval before proceeding.
</phase>

<phase id="7-summary">
## Phase 7: Summary & Confirmation

Before generating files, present a summary in the questions file:

```
Demo Summary
---
Goal:        [awareness/tutorial/showcase]
Audience:    [who]
Channel:     [where]
Duration:    [X seconds estimated]
Features:    [list capabilities covered]
Keybindings: [which ones demonstrated]
Interaction: [command palette/edit menu/etc.]
Scenario:    [code domain + file names]
Destinations:[Claude Code/Terminal/etc.]
Overlays:    [none/minimal/guided/hybrid]
Audio:       [silent/voiceover/music]
CTA:         [what action]
---
```

Ask: "Does this capture what you want? Any adjustments before I generate the files?"
</phase>

</workflow>

---

<output>
Only after completing all phases and receiving confirmation, generate:

1. `demo/{demo-name}/README.md` - Complete recording instructions with:
   - Goal and duration
   - Setup instructions (window layout, display settings)
   - Pre-recording checklist
   - Timed recording script ([0:00-0:05], [0:05-0:10], etc.)
   - The exact prompts to type
   - Post-production guidance
   - Troubleshooting section

2. `demo/{demo-name}/QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - One-page cheat sheet with:
   - Files to open
   - Lines to highlight
   - Exact text to type
   - Timing targets
   - Key hotkeys

3. Sample code file(s) - Following these guidelines:
   - Realistic and relatable
   - ~40 lines (scannable in demo)
   - Clear line numbers for the highlight targets
   - Syntactically valid TypeScript/JavaScript

4. Update `demo/README.md` - Add the new demo to the index table
   </output>

---

<style>
- Be conversational and supportive - the user is new to demo creation
- **Always use the questions file** - never ask questions inline in terminal
- Offer recommendations with rationale, but respect user preferences
- If user seems uncertain, provide concrete suggestions
- Be opinionated when asked: "For Twitter, I'd recommend X because..."
- After each phase, update the questions file and tell user which section to review
</style>

---

<start>
Begin by:
1. Reading the existing demo structure (`demo/README.md`, `demo/01-basic-usage/`)
2. Reading `demo/ASSET-STORAGE.md` for production tool recommendations
3. Using `/question` to create a questions file

Example opening:
"I'll help you create a compelling RangeLink demo. I've reviewed your existing demo structure and production tools.

I've saved all discovery questions to:

`.claude-questions/NNNN-demo-topic.txt`

Please review and fill in your answers, then let me know when you're ready to continue to Phase 6 (flow formalization)."

**Wizard Flow:**

1. Create questions file with ALL discovery questions (1-19) -> wait for user
2. Create detailed flow (Phase 6) based on answers -> wait for approval
3. Present summary (Phase 7) -> wait for confirmation
4. Generate files only after all phases complete
   </start>
