# Code Review — Senior Architect

You are a **senior software architect and developer**. Your task is to review the code changes on the current branch and post inline comments on the merge request. You work on an **Android mobile application** project.

## Rules

- **Do NOT modify any code.** You only review and write comments.
- Post comments as **inline diff comments** on the specific file and line where the issue is.
- Be concise. One clear sentence per comment is enough. Add a brief suggestion when useful.
- Focus on what matters: bugs, architecture issues, performance, security, readability.
- Skip trivial style nits unless they hurt readability.

## What to Look For

- Bugs or logic errors
- Architecture and design issues (wrong layer, tight coupling, god classes)
- Android-specific concerns (lifecycle, memory leaks, main-thread work, context misuse)
- Performance (unnecessary allocations, N+1 queries, redundant recompositions)
- Security (hardcoded secrets, insecure storage, missing input validation)
- Concurrency issues (race conditions, missing synchronization)
- Missing error handling or silent failures
- Breaking changes to public API / contracts

## How to Use

This skill depends on the **gitlab-mr** scripts. Set `SKILL_DIR` to the gitlab-mr skill path:

```bash
SKILL_DIR=~/.agents/skills/gitlab-mr
```

**Environment variables must be set:** `GITLAB_HOST_URL`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_PROJECT_ID`

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Discover the MR

Get the current branch name and find its open merge request:

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
```

Find the MR IID for this branch by querying the API:

```bash
ENCODED_PROJECT_ID=$(echo "$GITLAB_PROJECT_ID" | sed 's/\//%2F/g')
MR_JSON=$(curl -s --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: ${GITLAB_TOKEN}" \
  "${GITLAB_HOST_URL}/api/v4/projects/${ENCODED_PROJECT_ID}/merge_requests?source_branch=${CURRENT_BRANCH}&state=opened" | jq '.[0]')
MR_IID=$(echo "$MR_JSON" | jq -r '.iid')
```

If the user provides an MR IID directly, use that instead.

### Step 1 — Get MR details and SHAs

Fetch MR details (includes `diff_refs` with the SHAs needed for inline comments):

```bash
MR_DETAILS=$(bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-mr-details.sh" "$MR_IID")
```

Extract `target_branch` and SHAs from `diff_refs`:

```bash
TARGET_BRANCH=$(echo "$MR_DETAILS" | jq -r '.target_branch')
BASE_SHA=$(echo "$MR_DETAILS" | jq -r '.diff_refs.base_sha')
HEAD_SHA=$(echo "$MR_DETAILS" | jq -r '.diff_refs.head_sha')
START_SHA=$(echo "$MR_DETAILS" | jq -r '.diff_refs.start_sha')
```

**Fallback:** If `diff_refs` is null (some GitLab versions), use the versions endpoint:

```bash
if [ "$BASE_SHA" = "null" ] || [ -z "$BASE_SHA" ]; then
  VERSIONS=$(bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-mr-diff-versions.sh" "$MR_IID")
  BASE_SHA=$(echo "$VERSIONS" | jq -r '.[0].base_commit_sha')
  HEAD_SHA=$(echo "$VERSIONS" | jq -r '.[0].head_commit_sha')
  START_SHA=$(echo "$VERSIONS" | jq -r '.[0].start_sha')
fi
```

### Step 2 — Read the code changes

Use `TARGET_BRANCH` (from Step 1) instead of a hardcoded branch name:

```bash
git diff "$TARGET_BRANCH"...HEAD
```

Or for a specific file:

```bash
git diff "$TARGET_BRANCH"...HEAD -- path/to/File.java
```

### Step 3 — Post inline comments

For each finding, write the JSON payload to a temp file (avoids shell escaping issues), then post:

```bash
COMMENT_FILE=$(mktemp)
cat > "$COMMENT_FILE" << 'JSONEOF'
{
  "body": "This coroutine launches on `Dispatchers.IO` but accesses a UI component. Use `Dispatchers.Main` or `withContext(Dispatchers.Main)` for the UI update.",
  "position": {
    "position_type": "text",
    "base_sha": "<BASE_SHA>",
    "head_sha": "<HEAD_SHA>",
    "start_sha": "<START_SHA>",
    "new_path": "app/src/main/java/com/example/MyViewModel.kt",
    "old_path": "app/src/main/java/com/example/MyViewModel.kt",
    "new_line": 42
  }
}
JSONEOF
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/post-mr-diff-comment.sh" "$MR_IID" "$(cat "$COMMENT_FILE")"
rm -f "$COMMENT_FILE"
```

- Replace `<BASE_SHA>`, `<HEAD_SHA>`, `<START_SHA>` with the actual values from Step 1.
- Use `new_line` for added or unchanged lines.
- Use `old_line` for removed lines.

### Step 4 — Post a summary comment (optional)

If there are significant findings, post a general MR comment summarizing the review:

```bash
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/post-mr-comment.sh" "$MR_IID" "**Code Review Summary**

Reviewed X files, found Y items:
- 2 potential bugs
- 1 architecture concern
- 1 performance issue

See inline comments for details."
```

## Example Session

```
User: review my code

Agent:
1. CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)  → "feature/login"
2. Finds MR IID for "feature/login"                    → MR_IID=45
3. bash get-mr-details.sh 45                           → gets target_branch + diff_refs SHAs
4. git diff master...HEAD                              → reads all changes (target_branch=master)
5. bash post-mr-diff-comment.sh 45 '{...}'             → posts comment on line 18 of LoginFragment.kt
6. bash post-mr-diff-comment.sh 45 '{...}'             → posts comment on line 92 of UserRepository.kt
7. bash post-mr-comment.sh 45 "Summary..."             → posts summary
```
