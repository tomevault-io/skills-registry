# GitLab Merge Request Integration

Manage GitLab Merge Requests using bash scripts. List MRs, read comments, post feedback, and resolve discussions.

## How to Use

**Call bash scripts directly.** No MCP server required.

**Scripts location:** `~/.agents/skills/gitlab-mr/scripts/`

**IMPORTANT:** Environment variables must be set. Check with:
```bash
echo $GITLAB_HOST_URL $GITLAB_TOKEN $GITLAB_PROJECT_ID
```

If empty, add them to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
```bash
export GITLAB_HOST_URL="https://gitlab.com"
export GITLAB_TOKEN="glpat-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
export GITLAB_PROJECT_ID="12345678"
```

## Available Commands

Set `SKILL_DIR=~/.agents/skills/gitlab-mr`

### List Merge Requests

```bash
# List open MRs (default)
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/list-mrs.sh

# List merged MRs
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/list-mrs.sh merged

# List closed MRs
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/list-mrs.sh closed

# List all MRs
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/list-mrs.sh all
```

### Get MR Details

```bash
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-mr-details.sh 123
```

Returns full MR details including description, source/target branches, author.

### Get MR Comments

```bash
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-mr-comments.sh 123
```

### Get MR Discussions (Threaded)

```bash
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-mr-discussions.sh 123
```

Returns threaded discussions with code context. Includes discussion IDs for replies.

### Post Comment on MR

```bash
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/post-mr-comment.sh 123 "Your comment here"
```

### Reply to Discussion

```bash
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/reply-to-discussion.sh 123 "discussion_id_abc123" "Your reply"
```

### Resolve Discussion

```bash
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/resolve-discussion.sh 123 "discussion_id_abc123"
```

### Get MR Diff Versions

```bash
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-mr-diff-versions.sh 123
```

Returns diff version SHAs (`base_commit_sha`, `head_commit_sha`, `start_commit_sha`) needed for posting inline comments.

### Post Inline Diff Comment

```bash
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/post-mr-diff-comment.sh 123 '{"body":"Consider using a constant here","position":{"position_type":"text","base_sha":"abc123","head_sha":"def456","start_sha":"ghi789","new_path":"src/app.js","old_path":"src/app.js","new_line":42}}'
```

Posts a comment on a specific line of a file in the MR diff. Requires SHAs from `get-mr-diff-versions.sh`.

## Workflows

### 1. Review MR Comments

When user asks about MR comments or code review:

1. Run: `bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-mr-details.sh <iid>` for context
2. Run: `bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-mr-discussions.sh <iid>` for threaded comments
3. Group by: Unresolved (action needed) vs Resolved
4. Show code context for inline comments

### 2. Reply to Review Feedback

When user has fixed something and wants to reply:

1. Get discussion ID from the discussions list
2. Run: `bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/reply-to-discussion.sh <mr_iid> "<discussion_id>" "Fixed in commit abc123..."`
3. Optionally resolve: `bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/resolve-discussion.sh <mr_iid> "<discussion_id>"`

### 3. Post Inline Code Review Comment

When posting a comment on a specific line in the MR diff:

1. Get diff versions: `bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-mr-diff-versions.sh <mr_iid>`
2. Use the first (latest) version's SHAs (`base_commit_sha`, `head_commit_sha`, `start_commit_sha`)
3. Post the inline comment:
```bash
bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/post-mr-diff-comment.sh <mr_iid> '{"body":"Your comment","position":{"position_type":"text","base_sha":"<base_commit_sha>","head_sha":"<head_commit_sha>","start_sha":"<start_commit_sha>","new_path":"path/to/file.js","old_path":"path/to/file.js","new_line":42}}'
```

- Use `new_line` for commenting on added or unchanged lines (new side of the diff)
- Use `old_line` for commenting on removed lines (old side of the diff)
- For unchanged lines, you can provide both `new_line` and `old_line`

### 4. Post Fix Explanation

Template for fix comments:
```markdown
Fixed in commit `abc1234`.

**Changes made:**
- Replaced MD5 with bcrypt for password hashing
- Added salt rounds configuration

**Files changed:**
- `src/auth.js` - Implemented bcrypt hashing
- `tests/auth.test.js` - Added security tests
```

## Output Format

Present MRs as a table:

| IID | Title | State | Author | Source → Target |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| !123 | Add login feature | opened | @developer | feature/login → main |
| !124 | Fix parser bug | merged | @coder | fix/parser → main |

### Unresolved Discussions Format

- **@reviewer** on `src/auth.js:45`:
  > Consider using bcrypt instead of md5
  - Discussion ID: `abc123def`
