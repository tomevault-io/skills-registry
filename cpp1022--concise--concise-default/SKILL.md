# Concise Default

Toggle concise mode auto-activation globally. Affects Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex CLI.

## Commands

Run these in shell:

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `concise-default on` | Enable with last saved level. First time: `ultra`. |
| `concise-default on lite` | Enable with `lite` level. |
| `concise-default on ultra` | Enable with `ultra` level. |
| `concise-default off` | Disable auto-activation. |
| `concise-default status` | Show current state and level. |

Valid levels: `lite`, `ultra`.

## Behavior

- `on`: every new session starts with concise active; no manual trigger needed.
- `off`: removes generated concise defaults.
- Mid-session exit: `stop concise` or `normal mode`; this does not change the default setting.
- Saved level: `~/.config/concise/config`; persists across on/off cycles.
- Writes:
  - Cursor: `~/.cursor/rules/concise.mdc`
  - Claude Code: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  - Codex CLI: `~/.codex/instructions.md`
