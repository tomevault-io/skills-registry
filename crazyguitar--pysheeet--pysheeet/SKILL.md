# Readable Python Rules (/readable-py)

Apply these rules when writing, reviewing, or refactoring Python code. Inspired by *The Art of Readable Code* by Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher.

**Core principle: Code should be easy to understand.** The time it takes someone else (or future you) to understand the code is the ultimate metric.

## 1. Keep Functions Short and Focused

- A function should do **one thing**. If you can describe what it does with "and", split it.
- Aim for functions that fit on one screen (~15-25 lines). If it's longer, extract sub-tasks.
- Each function should operate at a **single level of abstraction** — don't mix high-level logic with low-level details in the same function.

## 2. Flatten Control Flow — No Deep Nesting

- **Never nest more than 2 levels deep.** If you have a loop inside a loop, or an `if` inside a loop inside an `if`, extract the inner block into a helper function with a descriptive name.
- Use **early returns / guard clauses** to handle edge cases at the top, keeping the main logic flat.
- Prefer `continue` or `break` to skip iterations rather than wrapping the body in a conditional.
- Replace complex conditionals with well-named helper functions or variables that explain the intent.

```
# Bad: nested and hard to follow
for user in users:
    if user.is_active:
        for order in user.orders:
            if order.is_pending:
                process(order)

# Good: flat, each function name explains what it does
active_users = get_active_users(users)
for user in active_users:
    process_pending_orders(user.orders)
```

## 3. Name Things Clearly

- **Pack information into names.** Use specific, concrete words — `fetch_page` not `get`, `num_retries` not `n`.
- **Avoid generic names** like `tmp`, `data`, `result`, `val`, `info`, `handle` — unless the scope is tiny (2-3 lines).
- **Use names that can't be misconstrued.** If a range is inclusive, say `max_items` not `limit`. If a boolean, use `is_`, `has_`, `should_`, `can_` prefixes.
- **Match the name length to the scope.** Short names for small scopes, descriptive names for wide scopes.
- **Don't use abbreviations** unless they're universally understood (`num`, `max`, `min`, `err` are fine; `svc_mgr_cfg` is not).

## 4. Make Control Flow Easy to Follow

- Put the **changing/interesting value on the left** side of comparisons: `if length > 10` not `if 10 < length`.
- Order `if/else` blocks: **positive case first**, simpler case first, or the more interesting case first.
- Minimize the number of variables the reader has to track. Reduce the **mental footprint** of each block.
- Avoid the **ternary operator** for anything non-trivial — if it's not immediately obvious, use an `if/else`.

## 5. Break Down Giant Expressions

- Use **explaining variables** to break complex expressions into named pieces.
- Use **summary variables** to capture a long expression that's used more than once.
- Apply **De Morgan's laws** to simplify negated boolean expressions.

```
# Bad
if not (age >= 18 and has_id and not is_banned):
    deny()

# Good
is_eligible = age >= 18 and has_id and not is_banned
if not is_eligible:
    deny()
```

## 6. Extract Unrelated Subproblems

- If a block of code is solving a **subproblem unrelated to the main goal** of the function, extract it.
- The helper function should be **pure and self-contained** — it shouldn't need to know about the calling context.
- This is the single most effective way to improve readability: separate *what* you're doing from *how*.

## 7. One Task at a Time

- Each section of code should do **one task**. If a function is doing parsing AND validation AND transformation, split them into separate steps.
- List the tasks a function does. If there's more than one, reorganize so each task is in its own block or function.

## 8. Reduce Variable Scope

- **Declare variables close to where they're used.** Don't declare at the top of a function if it's only used 30 lines later.
- **Minimize the "live time" of a variable** — the fewer lines between its assignment and last use, the easier it is to follow.
- **Prefer write-once variables.** Variables that are assigned once and never modified are easier to reason about.
- **Eliminate unnecessary variables.** If a variable is used only once and doesn't clarify anything, inline it.

## 9. No Magic Numbers or Strings

- Replace **magic numbers and strings** with named constants: `if retries > MAX_RETRIES` not `if retries > 3`.
- If a value has meaning, give it a name. The name documents the intent.
- Group related constants together.

## 10. Fewer Function Arguments

- Aim for **3 or fewer arguments** per function. More than that is a smell.
- Group related arguments into an **object, dataclass, or named tuple**.
- If a function needs many config-like options, pass a single config/options object.
- Boolean flag arguments are a sign the function does two things — split it instead.

## 11. Consistency

- If the codebase does something one way, **do it the same way**. Don't mix styles.
- Consistent naming patterns, consistent structure, consistent error handling.
- When joining an existing codebase, **match the existing conventions** even if you'd prefer a different style.
- Surprise is the enemy of readability — predictable code is readable code.

## 12. Write Less Code

- The best code is **no code at all**. Question whether a feature is truly needed before implementing.
- **Don't over-engineer.** Solve the problem at hand, not hypothetical future problems.
- Remove dead code. Commented-out code is dead code.
- Use standard libraries before writing custom solutions.

## 13. Comments: Explain Why, Not What

- Don't comment **what** the code does — the code already says that. Comment **why** it does it.
- Comment **flaws and workarounds**: `// TODO:`, `// HACK:`, `// XXX:` with explanation.
- Comment **surprising behavior** or non-obvious decisions — things where a reader would ask "why?".
- **Don't comment bad code — rewrite it.** If you need a comment to explain what a block does, extract it into a well-named function instead.

## 14. Design Code to Survive Auto-Formatting

- Write code that looks good **after** the auto-formatter runs. If a chained expression or repeated pattern would be broken across 4+ lines by the formatter, extract a helper function instead.
- **Prefer one-line helper calls** over long inline chains that the formatter will expand vertically.
- The formatter is your reader's first impression. Run it *before* committing — if the result looks ugly, that's a signal to refactor, not to disable the formatter.

```python
# Bad: black wraps this into a multi-line mess
result = (
    client.get_session()
    .query(User)
    .filter(User.active == True)
    .options(joinedload(User.orders))
    .order_by(User.created_at.desc())
    .limit(page_size)
    .all()
)

# Good: extract a helper so the call site stays clean
def get_active_users(session, page_size: int) -> list[User]:
    return (
        session.query(User)
        .filter(User.active == True)
        .options(joinedload(User.orders))
        .order_by(User.created_at.desc())
        .limit(page_size)
        .all()
    )

users = get_active_users(client.get_session(), page_size=20)
```

```python
# Bad: dict comprehension with inline chain — black expands to 5+ lines
config = {
    k: settings.get(k, defaults.get(k, fallbacks.get(k, None)))
    for k in required_keys
}

# Good: extract the lookup
def resolve_setting(key, settings, defaults, fallbacks):
    return settings.get(key, defaults.get(key, fallbacks.get(key)))

config = {k: resolve_setting(k, settings, defaults, fallbacks) for k in required_keys}
```

# Python-Specific Rules

## 15. Prefer Comprehensions — But Keep Them Simple

- Use list/dict/set comprehensions for **simple transforms and filters**.
- If a comprehension needs a nested loop AND a conditional, it's too complex — use a regular loop or extract a helper.
- Generator expressions for large sequences to avoid materializing the whole list.

```python
# Good: simple and readable
names = [user.name for user in users if user.is_active]

# Bad: too much going on
result = [transform(item) for group in data for item in group.items if item.valid and item.type == "A"]

# Good: break it up
valid_items = get_valid_items(data, item_type="A")
result = [transform(item) for item in valid_items]
```

## 16. Use Unpacking

- **Tuple unpacking** over index access: `name, age = get_user()` not `result[0], result[1]`.
- **Star unpacking** for head/tail: `first, *rest = items`.
- **Dict unpacking** with `**` for merging dicts.
- Unpacking makes the structure of the data explicit in the code.

## 17. Use `enumerate`, `zip`, and Itertools

- Use `enumerate(items)` — never track indices manually with `i += 1`.
- Use `zip(a, b)` to iterate in parallel — never index into parallel lists.
- Use `itertools` (`chain`, `groupby`, `islice`) before writing manual iteration logic.

## 18. Use Dataclasses and NamedTuples Over Raw Dicts/Tuples

- If a dict always has the same keys, it should be a `dataclass` or `NamedTuple`.
- If a function returns more than 2 values, return a `dataclass` or `NamedTuple` — not a raw tuple.
- This gives you names, type hints, and readable attribute access for free.

## 19. Use `pathlib` for File Paths

- Use `pathlib.Path` instead of `os.path.join` and string manipulation.
- `Path` objects are readable, composable (`/` operator), and cross-platform.
