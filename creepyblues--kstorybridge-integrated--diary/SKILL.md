# Development Diary Skill

Automates the creation and management of development diary entries for KStoryBridge, capturing work sessions from Claude Code history and git commits.

## When to Use This Skill

- At the end of a development session to generate a diary entry
- During sessions to capture important insights or decisions
- To take screenshots of completed features for the diary
- To check diary status and recent entries

## Automated Daily Generation

The diary is automatically generated **daily at 4:00 AM PST** for the previous day's work.

**How it works:**
- A macOS LaunchAgent (`com.kstorybridge.daily-diary`) runs `scripts/daily-diary.sh`
- Collects Claude Code history from `~/.claude/history.jsonl`
- Analyzes git commits from the KStoryBridge repo
- Generates and publishes entry directly to `marketing/development_diary/published/`

**Manage the schedule:**
```bash
# Check if running
launchctl list | grep kstorybridge

# Stop the scheduled job
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kstorybridge.daily-diary.plist

# Start the scheduled job
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kstorybridge.daily-diary.plist

# Run manually for a specific date
.claude/skills/diary/scripts/daily-diary.sh 2026-01-25

# View logs
tail -f marketing/development_diary/logs/daily-diary.log
```

**Files:**
- Script: `.claude/skills/diary/scripts/daily-diary.sh`
- LaunchAgent: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kstorybridge.daily-diary.plist`
- Config: `.claude/skills/diary/config.env`
- Logs: `marketing/development_diary/logs/`

### Slack Notifications

When configured, the daily diary sends a rich Slack notification with:
- Date and highlight
- Daily summary
- Session/commit stats
- Link to view on web

**Setup:**
```bash
# Create config file from example
cp .claude/skills/diary/config.env.example .claude/skills/diary/config.env

# Edit and add your Slack webhook URL
# Get one from: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
```

The Slack message includes:
- Header with date
- Highlight of the day's work
- Summary paragraph
- Stats (sessions, commits, categories)
- Button link to web view

## Commands

### Generate Entry

Generate a diary entry for today or a specific date.

```
/diary generate                    # Generate today's entry
/diary generate --date=2026-01-08  # Generate for specific date
/diary generate --screenshot       # Include screenshot capture
```

### Add Insight

Capture an insight or decision during a session.

```
/diary add "insight text"
/diary add --category=decision "Chose confidence threshold of 0.7"
/diary add --category=learning "Edge function timeout at 25s for large payloads"
```

Categories: `decision`, `learning`, `insight`, `todo`

### Capture Screenshot

Take a screenshot of current app state.

```
/diary screenshot                           # Auto-named
/diary screenshot --name="quality-preview"  # Custom name
/diary screenshot --url=http://localhost:8081/some-page
```

### Manage Entries

```
/diary list                    # List recent entries
/diary status                  # Show today's progress
```

## Generation Workflow

When `/diary generate` is invoked:

### Date Determination

First, determine the target date for the entry:

1. **If user specified `--date=YYYY-MM-DD`:** Use that date (e.g., `/diary generate --date=2026-01-08` → use `2026-01-08`)
2. **If no date specified:** Use today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

Store this as the `TARGET_DATE` to use in all subsequent steps.

### Step 1: Collect Claude Code History

Run `scripts/collect_history.py` to parse `~/.claude/history.jsonl`:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/diary/scripts/collect_history.py --date={TARGET_DATE}
```

This extracts:
- User prompts from sessions for the KStoryBridge project
- Timestamps and session IDs
- Groupings by session

### Step 2: Analyze Git Commits

Run `scripts/analyze_commits.py` to get git activity:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/diary/scripts/analyze_commits.py --date={TARGET_DATE}
```

This extracts:
- Commit messages and timestamps
- Files changed (names only, no code)
- Lines added/deleted statistics
- Auto-categorization based on commit messages

### Step 3: Correlate and Categorize

Match prompts with commits by timestamp proximity. Categorize all activities using these keywords:

| Category | Keywords |
|----------|----------|
| Research | research, investigate, explore, analyze, study, compare |
| Planning | plan, design, architect, structure, decide, spec |
| Implementation | implement, create, add, build, develop, feature |
| Bug Fix | fix, bug, issue, error, crash, resolve, debug |
| Refactoring | refactor, cleanup, reorganize, simplify, improve |
| Documentation | doc, document, readme, update docs |
| Testing | test, e2e, playwright, unit test, coverage |

### Step 4: Load Manual Insights

Check for insights added during the day via `/diary add`:

```
marketing/development_diary/drafts/.insights-{TARGET_DATE}.json
```

### Step 5: Capture Screenshots (if --screenshot)

Use Playwright MCP to capture current app state:

```
mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__browser_navigate
mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__browser_take_screenshot
```

Save to: `marketing/development_diary/screenshots/{TARGET_DATE}/`

### Step 6: Generate Entry

Use the template at `marketing/development_diary/templates/daily-entry.md` to generate a complete entry with:

- YAML frontmatter (date, status, categories, etc.)
- Daily summary (2-3 sentences)
- Work sessions with timestamps
- Categorized activity lists
- Screenshots with captions
- Statistics table
- Tomorrow's focus section

### Step 7: Publish Entry

Write directly to: `marketing/development_diary/published/YYYY/MM/{TARGET_DATE}.md`

Create the directory structure (`published/YYYY/MM/`) if it doesn't exist. Set `status: published` in the frontmatter.

## Privacy Guidelines

**DO NOT include in entries:**
- Actual code snippets
- API keys, secrets, or credentials
- Internal business logic details
- User data or PII

**DO include:**
- Feature names and descriptions
- File counts and change statistics
- High-level architectural decisions
- Public-facing UI screenshots

## Output Locations

| Type | Path |
|------|------|
| Published | `marketing/development_diary/published/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| Screenshots | `marketing/development_diary/screenshots/YYYY-MM-DD/` |
| Insights | `marketing/development_diary/drafts/.insights-YYYY-MM-DD.json` |

---

## Insights & Learnings

> **Decision:** Chose to implement retry logic on client side rather than server to reduce Gemini API costs.

> **Learning:** Background removal API fails silently on very low contrast images.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sessions | 3 |
| Commits | 7 |
| Files Changed | 12 |
| Lines Added | 487 |
