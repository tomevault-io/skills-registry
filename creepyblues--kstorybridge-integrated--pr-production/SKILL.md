# PR Production

This skill streamlines the process of creating a pull request from v2 (staging) to main (production) with comprehensive change tracking and deployment verification.

## When to Use This Skill

- After testing changes in staging environment
- Ready to deploy to production
- Creating a production release PR
- Promoting v2 changes to main branch

## Commands

```
/pr-production                                    # Create PR with auto-generated title
/pr-production --title="Feature: New chatbot"     # Create PR with custom title
/pr-production --draft                            # Create as draft PR
/pr-production --check                            # Check readiness without creating PR
```

## Prerequisites

Before creating a production PR:

1. **Changes tested in staging** - All changes deployed and tested
2. **CI passing on v2** - All tests green
3. **No uncommitted changes** - Clean working directory
4. **v2 branch up to date** - Synced with remote

## PR Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-flight Checks

Verify readiness for production:

```bash
# Ensure on v2 branch
git branch --show-current
# Expected: v2

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain
# Expected: empty

# Ensure v2 is up to date
git fetch origin
git status -uno
# Expected: up to date with origin/v2

# Check if v2 has commits ahead of main
git log main..v2 --oneline
# Expected: list of commits to merge
```

### Step 2: Gather Change Information

Collect data for PR body:

```bash
# Get commits since last main merge
COMMITS=$(git log main..v2 --oneline)

# Get files changed
FILES_CHANGED=$(git diff --name-only main..v2)

# Count changes by app
DASHBOARD_CHANGES=$(git diff --name-only main..v2 | grep "^apps/dashboard" | wc -l)
CREATOR_CHANGES=$(git diff --name-only main..v2 | grep "^apps/creator" | wc -l)
WEBSITE_CHANGES=$(git diff --name-only main..v2 | grep "^apps/website" | wc -l)
FUNCTIONS_CHANGES=$(git diff --name-only main..v2 | grep "^supabase/functions" | wc -l)
MIGRATIONS_CHANGES=$(git diff --name-only main..v2 | grep "^supabase/migrations" | wc -l)

# Check for breaking changes (look for migrations, type changes)
BREAKING_CHANGES=$(git diff --name-only main..v2 | grep -E "(migration|types\.ts)" | wc -l)
```

### Step 3: Generate PR Title

Auto-generate title based on changes:

```
# If single feature/fix (most common)
feat: Add new mandate matcher improvements

# If multiple changes
chore: Merge v2 staging changes (dashboard, creator)

# If hotfix
fix: Resolve authentication timeout issue
```

### Step 4: Generate PR Body

Create comprehensive PR body:

```markdown
## Summary

This PR promotes staging (v2) changes to production (main).

### Changes Included

**Commits**: [X] commits since last production deploy

## Error Handling

### Not on v2 Branch

```
ERROR: Not on v2 branch

Current branch: feature/new-feature

To create a production PR, first merge your changes to v2:
  git checkout v2
  git merge feature/new-feature
  git push origin v2

Then run /pr-production again.
```

### Uncommitted Changes

```
ERROR: Uncommitted changes detected

Modified files:
- apps/dashboard/src/App.tsx
- apps/creator/src/pages/Home.tsx

Commit or stash changes before creating PR:
  git add .
  git commit -m "..."
  # or
  git stash
```

### v2 Behind main

```
WARNING: v2 is behind main

v2 is 3 commits behind main.

Rebase v2 on main before creating PR:
  git fetch origin
  git rebase origin/main
  git push origin v2 --force-with-lease

Or merge main into v2:
  git merge origin/main
  git push origin v2
```

### No Changes

```
ERROR: No changes to merge

v2 is up to date with main.

Nothing to deploy. Make changes to v2 first.
```

## Tips

- Use `--check` before `--create` to preview the PR
- Add custom title with `--title` for clarity
- Use `--draft` if you want review before marking ready
- Check Vercel deployment status after merging
- Keep PRs focused - consider smaller, more frequent releases
