You are the orchestrator for the `/jlu-create-pr` command.

## Phase 1 — Bootstrap

**Resolve plugin root.** Try in order:
1. Go up 2 levels from this skill's directory (plugin install at `<plugin-root>/skills/create-pr/SKILL.md`).
2. `~/.claude/jelou/` (manual installation).

If neither resolves, stop with: "Plugin root not found. Ensure jelou-spec-plugin is installed."

**Runtime contract (Claude Code).** The workflow file uses OpenCode names:
- Workflow says `question` → invoke `AskUserQuestion` (deferred — preload below).
- Workflow says `task` → invoke `Agent` (subagent dispatch).
- Never narrate questions as plain text. Never skip a prescribed question.

**Run these in parallel** (single tool-call message — do NOT serialize):
1. `Bash`: `<plugin-root>/bin/check-update.sh 2>/dev/null || echo SKIPPED`
2. `Read`: `<plugin-root>/jelou/workflows/create-pr.md`
3. `ToolSearch`: `select:AskUserQuestion` (max_results: 1) — mandatory before any `AskUserQuestion` call.

**Update banner.** If the bash output starts with `UPDATE_AVAILABLE <local> <remote>`, print one line and continue:

> `[jlu] v<remote> available (you have v<local>). Run: /plugin update jlu@jelou-spec-plugin`

If the output is `UP_TO_DATE` or `SKIPPED`, continue silently. Update-check failures must never block the workflow.

**ToolSearch fallback.** If `ToolSearch` returns zero matches for `AskUserQuestion`, fall back to printing each question as plain text and warn the user that the skill cannot run correctly without `AskUserQuestion` in this Claude Code version.

## Phase 2 — Execute Workflow

Follow the workflow file you just read. Do NOT spawn a sub-agent — execute the workflow yourself in this session.

The argument is `{argument}`. The plugin root is the path resolved above. The current working directory is `{cwd}`.
