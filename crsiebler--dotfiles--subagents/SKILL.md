# Subagents Local Catalog Tool

Manage and access subagents from the local filesystem. Scans $HOME/.config/opencode/agents/ for agent definitions and provides browsing, searching, and fetching capabilities.

---

## The Job

1. Receive user request for subagent operations (list, search, fetch)
2. Scan local filesystem for agent definitions
3. Parse YAML frontmatter and extract metadata
4. Filter and format results as requested
5. Return formatted results to the user

**Important:** All operations use local filesystem access - no network requests required.

---

## Step 1: Parse User Request

Identify the operation type:
- **list**: Show all categories and their subagents
- **search <query>**: Find subagents matching keywords in name or description
- **fetch <name>**: Get the full markdown content for a specific subagent

---

## Step 2: Scan Local Agent Directory

1. **Check for agents directory**: Use glob with absolute path: `glob` with `path="$HOME/.config/opencode/agents"` and `pattern="*.md"`
2. **Handle missing directory**: If no agents found, provide helpful setup instructions
3. **Parse agent files**: For each .md file found, use read to extract:
   - YAML frontmatter (name, description, tools, category)
   - Filename for categorization (backend-, frontend-, devops- prefixes)

### Frontmatter Extraction Pattern
Use read to get file contents, then parse YAML between `---` markers:
```
---
name: backend-developer
description: Senior backend engineer for scalable APIs
tools: postgresql_execute_query, jira_search_issues
---
```

### Categorization Logic
Extract category from filename prefixes:
- `backend-*` → Backend Development
- `frontend-*` → Frontend Development  
- `devops-*` → DevOps & Infrastructure
- `qa-*` → Quality & Testing
- `security-*` → Security
- `data-*` → Data & Analytics
- `ui-*` → UI/UX Design
- `mobile-*` → Mobile Development
- `cloud-*` → Cloud & Platform
- `docs-*` → Documentation
- Other → General

---

## Step 3: Process Request

### For List Operation
1. Collect all agent files using glob
2. Group by category using filename prefix logic
3. Format organized list by categories:
```
## Backend Development
- backend-developer: Senior backend engineer for scalable APIs
- database-architect: Database design and optimization expert

## Frontend Development  
- frontend-developer: React/Vue/Angular specialist
- ui-designer: User interface and experience designer
...
```

### For Search Operation
1. Use grep to search agent files for keywords in:
   - Names (filename and frontmatter name field)
   - Descriptions (frontmatter description field)
   - Tools (frontmatter tools field)
2. Return matches with category context:
```
Found 3 matching subagents:

## Security-Related Subagents
- security-engineer (Infrastructure): Security specialist for cloud infrastructure
- security-auditor (Quality): Security vulnerability assessment expert
- backend-security (Backend): API security and authentication specialist
```

### For Fetch Operation
1. Find exact match for requested name using glob pattern `*{name}*.md`
2. Use read to return full file content including frontmatter and body
3. If not found, suggest similar names using partial matches

---

## Output Format

- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Include category names for organization
- Show brief descriptions in lists
- Return full content for fetches
- Include tool lists for context

---

## Error Handling

### No Agents Directory Found
```
❌ No subagents found in $HOME/.config/opencode/agents/

To set up subagents:
1. Create the directory: mkdir -p $HOME/.config/opencode/agents
2. Add agent definition files as .md files with YAML frontmatter
3. Example agent file:
   ---
   name: backend-developer
   description: Senior backend engineer for scalable APIs
   tools: postgresql_execute_query, jira_search_issues
   ---
   
   # Backend Developer
   
   Expert in building scalable backend systems...
```

### No Search Results
```
❌ No subagents found matching "keyword"

💡 Try these alternatives:
- Search for different keywords
- Use `/subagents list` to see all available agents
- Check for typos in your search query
```

### Agent Not Found for Fetch
```
❌ Subagent "agent-name" not found

💡 Did you mean:
- similar-agent-name (Backend Development)
- agent-name-alt (Infrastructure)

Use `/subagents list` to see all available agents.
```

## Examples

### List all subagents:
```
## Backend Development
- backend-developer: Senior backend engineer for scalable APIs
  Tools: postgresql_execute_query, jira_search_issues
- database-architect: Database design and optimization expert
  Tools: postgresql_execute_query

## Frontend Development  
- frontend-developer: React/Vue/Angular specialist
  Tools: chrome_click, chrome_fill, playwright_browser_evaluate
```

### Search for "security":
```
Found 3 matching subagents:

## Security-Related Subagents
- security-engineer (Infrastructure): Security specialist for cloud infrastructure
  File: security-engineer.md
  Tools: jira_search_issues, bash
  
- security-auditor (Quality): Security vulnerability assessment expert  
  File: qa-security-auditor.md
  Tools: jira_search_issues, grep
```

### Fetch backend-developer:
```
# Backend Developer

---
name: backend-developer

## File Structure Requirements

Agents should be stored as `.md` files in `$HOME/.config/opencode/agents/` with:

1. **YAML Frontmatter** with required fields:
   - `name`: Human-readable agent name
   - `description`: Brief description of capabilities
   - `tools`: Comma-separated list of available tools
   - `category` (optional): Override auto-categorization

2. **Filename** following naming convention:
   - Use hyphens for spaces: `backend-developer.md`
   - Include category prefix for auto-categorization: `backend-`, `frontend-`, etc.

3. **Markdown Body** with sections like:
   - Overview
   - Capabilities  
   - Usage examples
   - Tool documentation
