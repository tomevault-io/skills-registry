# Skill Reviewer

Inventory all installed skills and agents, then deep-review selected ones for conciseness, clarity, overlap, and token efficiency.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Build inventory

Scan all skill and agent locations. For each item, count lines in the main file and any reference files.

**Locations:**
- Global skills: `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` + `references/*.md`
- Global agents: `~/.claude/agents/*.md`
- Project skills: `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` + `references/*.md`
- Project agents: `.claude/agents/*.md`

Build a table sorted by total lines (largest first):

```
| Scope   | Name             | Type  | Main Lines | Ref Lines | Total |
|---------|------------------|-------|------------|-----------|-------|
| global  | ci-cd-pipeline   | skill | 120        | 45        | 165   |
| project | bug-bash-update  | skill | 109        | 0         | 109   |
| global  | debugger         | agent | 98         | 0         | 98    |
```

### Phase 2: Ask what to review

Present the table. Ask the user which items to deep-review. They can pick one, several, or "all".

### Phase 3: Deep review

For each selected item, read the full content and analyze:

1. **Conciseness** — Verbose sections, redundant instructions, unnecessary examples. Flag anything that could be shorter without losing meaning.
2. **Clarity** — Ambiguous instructions, missing context, unclear phase transitions. Would another LLM session interpret this correctly?
3. **Scope overlap** — Responsibilities duplicated with other skills/agents in the inventory. Note which items overlap and what to consolidate.
4. **Token efficiency** — Estimate token count (words * 1.3). Flag sections that consume disproportionate tokens relative to their value.
5. **Structural consistency** — Does it follow the same patterns (frontmatter, phases, guidelines) as other skills? Note deviations.

### Phase 4: Present findings with rewrites

For each issue, show:
- **Current text** (quoted)
- **Problem** (one sentence)
- **Suggested rewrite** (the improved version)

After presenting all findings, ask the user which changes to apply. Then apply the approved edits.

## Guidelines

- Be specific. "This section is verbose" is useless. "Lines 12-18 repeat the trigger list from the frontmatter" is actionable.
- Preserve intent. Compress prose, don't change behavior.
- Don't review this skill (skill-reviewer) unless explicitly asked.
- When estimating tokens, use the rough formula: word count * 1.3.
- If a skill has no issues worth flagging, say so briefly and move on.
