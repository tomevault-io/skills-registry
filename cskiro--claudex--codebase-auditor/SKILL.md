name: codebase-auditor
description: Use PROACTIVELY when auditing code quality, running security scans, assessing technical debt, reviewing code for production readiness, setting up CI quality gates, or tracking DORA metrics. Analyzes codebases against OWASP Top 10, SOLID principles, Testing Trophy, and 2024-25 SDLC standards. Supports incremental audits for large codebases. Not for runtime profiling or real-time monitoring. Use when this capability is needed.

# Codebase Auditor

Comprehensive codebase audits using modern software engineering standards with actionable remediation plans.

## When to Use

- Audit codebase for quality, security, maintainability
- Assess technical debt and estimate remediation
- Prepare production readiness report
- Evaluate legacy codebase for modernization
- Set up quality gates for CI/CD pipelines
- Configure incremental audits for large codebases (>100k LOC)
- Track audit history and trends over time

## Trigger Phrases

- "Audit this codebase" / "Run a code audit"
- "Security scan" / "Check for vulnerabilities"
- "Assess technical debt" / "How much tech debt?"
- "Production readiness review"
- "Set up quality gates"
- "DORA metrics" / "Deployment health"

## Audit Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment
- Project discovery (tech stack, frameworks, tools)
- Quick health check (LOC, docs, git practices)
- Red flag detection (secrets, massive files)

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis
Load on demand based on Phase 1 findings.

### Phase 3: Report Generation
Comprehensive report with scores and priorities.

### Phase 4: Remediation Planning
Prioritized action plan with effort estimates.

## Analysis Categories

| Category | Key Checks |
|----------|------------|
| Code Quality | Complexity, duplication, code smells |
| Testing | Coverage (80% min), trophy distribution, quality |
| Security | OWASP Top 10, dependencies, secrets |
| Architecture | SOLID, patterns, modularity |
| Performance | Build time, bundle size, runtime |
| Documentation | JSDoc, README, ADRs |
| DevOps | CI/CD maturity, DORA metrics |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance |

## Technical Debt Rating (SQALE)

| Grade | Remediation Effort |
|-------|-------------------|
| A | <= 5% of dev time |
| B | 6-10% |
| C | 11-20% |
| D | 21-50% |
| E | > 50% |

## Usage Examples

```
# Basic audit
Audit this codebase using the codebase-auditor skill.

# Security focused
Run a security-focused audit on this codebase.

# Quick health check
Give me a quick health check (Phase 1 only).

# Custom scope
Audit focusing on test coverage and security.
```

## Output Formats

1. **Markdown Report** - Human-readable for PR comments
2. **JSON Report** - Machine-readable for CI/CD
3. **HTML Dashboard** - Interactive visualization
4. **Remediation Plan** - Prioritized action items

## Priority Levels

| Priority | Examples | Timeline |
|----------|----------|----------|
| P1 Critical | Security vulns, data loss risks | Immediate |
| P2 High | Coverage gaps, performance issues | This sprint |
| P3 Medium | Code smells, doc gaps | Next quarter |
| P4 Low | Stylistic, minor optimizations | Backlog |

## Best Practices

1. Run incrementally for large codebases
2. Focus on critical paths first
3. Baseline before major releases
4. Track metrics over time
5. Integrate with CI/CD

## Integrations

Complements: SonarQube, ESLint, Jest/Vitest, npm audit, Lighthouse, GitHub Actions

## Limitations

- Static analysis only (no runtime profiling)
- Requires source code access
- Internet needed for CVE data
- Large codebases need chunked analysis
