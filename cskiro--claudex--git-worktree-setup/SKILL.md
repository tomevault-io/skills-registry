name: git-worktree-setup
description: Use PROACTIVELY when working on multiple branches simultaneously or creating parallel Claude Code sessions. Automates git worktree creation with prerequisite checking, development environment initialization, and safe cleanup. Supports single worktree, batch creation, and worktree removal. Not for non-git projects or branch management without worktrees. Use when this capability is needed.

# Git Worktree Setup

Automates git worktree creation for parallel Claude Code sessions without conflicts.

## When to Use

**Trigger Phrases**:
- "create a worktree for [branch-name]"
- "set up worktree for [feature]"
- "create worktrees for [branch1], [branch2]"
- "remove worktree [name]"
- "list my worktrees"

**Use Cases**:
- Working on multiple features simultaneously
- Parallel Claude Code sessions on different branches
- Code review while continuing development
- Emergency hotfixes without interrupting work

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Request | Mode | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| "create worktree for X" | Single | Create one worktree |
| "set up worktrees for X, Y" | Batch | Create multiple |
| "remove worktree X" | Cleanup | Remove specific |
| "list worktrees" | List | Display status |

## Workflow Overview

### Phase 0: Prerequisites (Mandatory)
```bash
# Verify git repo
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree

# Check uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain

# Get repo name
basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

### Phase 1: Gather Information
- Branch name (required)
- New or existing branch
- Location (default: `../repo-branch`)
- Setup dev environment

### Phase 2: Create Worktree
```bash
# New branch
git worktree add ../project-feature -b feature

# Existing branch
git worktree add ../project-bugfix bugfix
```

### Phase 3: Dev Environment Setup
- Detect package manager
- Run install
- Copy .env files

### Phase 4: Next Steps
- Show worktree path
- Provide navigation commands
- List all worktrees

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Create with new branch
git worktree add ../project-branch -b branch-name

# Create from existing
git worktree add ../project-branch branch-name

# List all
git worktree list

# Remove worktree
git worktree remove ../project-branch

# Remove worktree and branch
git worktree remove ../project-branch
git branch -D branch-name
```

## Package Manager Detection

| Lock File | Manager |
|-----------|---------|
| pnpm-lock.yaml | pnpm |
| yarn.lock | yarn |
| bun.lockb | bun |
| package-lock.json | npm |

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "invalid reference" | Branch doesn't exist | Use `-b` for new |
| "already exists" | Directory exists | Choose different location |
| "uncommitted changes" | Dirty working dir | Commit or stash |

## Safety Protocols

**Before Creating**:
- [ ] Verify git repository
- [ ] Check clean working directory
- [ ] Validate target directory available

**Before Cleanup**:
- [ ] Confirm user intent
- [ ] Check for uncommitted changes
- [ ] Warn about permanent branch deletion

## Example Output

```
✓ Worktree created: /Users/connor/myapp-feature-auth
✓ Branch: feature-auth (new)
✓ Dependencies installed

Next steps:
  cd ../myapp-feature-auth
  claude

All worktrees:
- /path/to/main (main) ← current
- /path/to/worktree (feature-auth) ← new
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Worktree in correct location
- [ ] Branch checked out properly
- [ ] Files visible in directory
- [ ] Dev environment ready
- [ ] Appears in `git worktree list`
- [ ] User can start Claude Code
