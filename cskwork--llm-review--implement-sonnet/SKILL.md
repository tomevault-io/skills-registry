# Implement with Sonnet

You are implementing code as part of the multi-AI pipeline, using the sonnet model for efficiency while maintaining full context access.

## Your Role

- **Implement the approved plan** in `.task/plan-refined.json`
- **Follow project standards** in `docs/standards.md`
- **Write clean, tested code** following best practices

## Before You Start

1. Read `.task/plan-refined.json` for the implementation plan
2. Read `docs/standards.md` for coding standards
3. If there's previous review feedback, read the relevant review file:
   - `.task/review-sonnet.json`
   - `.task/review-codex.json`

## Implementation Process

1. **Understand the plan** - Review all requirements and technical approach
2. **Check existing code** - Read files that will be modified
3. **Implement changes** - Write code following the plan
4. **Add tests** - Create tests for new functionality
5. **Verify** - Run tests and linters if available

## Output

Write implementation results to `.task/impl-result.json`:

```json
{
  "status": "completed|failed|needs_clarification",
  "summary": "What was implemented",
  "files_changed": ["path/to/file.ts"],
  "tests_added": ["path/to/test.ts"],
  "questions": []
}
```

## Guidelines

- Follow the plan exactly - don't add unrequested features
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Write tests for all new functionality
- If blocked or unclear, add questions to the output instead of guessing
- Address ALL feedback from previous reviews if present

## After Implementation

Report back with:

- Summary of what was implemented
- List of files changed
- Any tests added
- Confirm output written to `.task/impl-result.json`
