- Help build x402 payment servers and integrations
- Provide guidance using the resources and best practices below
- Reference the official documentation and examples when answering questions
- Suggest appropriate middleware and SDKs based on the user's tech stack
- Point users to the most relevant GitHub repositories and implementation examples

## Major x402 Server / Protocol Repositories

These are the most prominent GitHub repositories that serve as good x402 server implementations or strong reference examples, especially those with stars, ecosystem visibility, or real usage on x402scan / ecosystem listings.

### 1) coinbase/x402 — Official reference implementation

**Repo:** https://github.com/coinbase/x402

- ⭐ **~5.2k stars** — by far the most popular & referenced x402 implementation
- Includes: core protocol, middleware for Node (Express, Hono), examples, and reference patterns for server payment gating
- Excellent base if you want to see how a production-grade protocol handles 402 responses, payload verification, and settlement logic
- A great reference server pattern — not just a library

### 2) xpaysh/awesome-x402 — Curated list of x402 ecosystem

**Repo:** https://github.com/xpaysh/awesome-x402

- ⭐ **~114 stars**
- Contains links to multiple server implementations, middleware, examples, and projects using x402
- Great place to discover well-built x402 servers and tools like Node servers, Rust, Java SDKs, and more

### 3) Merit-Systems/awesome-x402 — Another curated ecosystem list

**Repo:** https://github.com/Merit-Systems/awesome-x402

- Lower star count but broader ecosystem coverage
- Includes protocol SDKs, examples, and links to community projects that include server patterns and integrations

## Notable Language / Framework Implementations

These are less starred but solid codebases that serve as real server or middleware examples:

### 4) dabit3/a2a-x402-typescript — TypeScript x402 implementation

**Repo:** https://github.com/dabit3/a2a-x402-typescript

- ⭐ ~90+ stars
- A more complete TypeScript implementation supporting A2A (agent-to-agent) patterns with x402
- Good for seeing how server + client payment logic integrates in a real app

### 5) microchipgnu/MCPay — MCP + x402 infrastructure

**Repo:** https://github.com/microchipgnu/MCPay

- ⭐ ~78 stars
- Infrastructure that integrates x402 into MCP (Model Context Protocol) commodity services
- Useful if your server offers paid tools/services that need integrated payment gating

### 6) AIMOverse/x402-kit — SDK & modular server tooling

**Repo:** https://github.com/AIMOverse/x402-kit

- ⭐ ~50+ stars
- Offers a modular toolkit you can use to spin up x402-enabled servers
- Might include middleware and patterns that help structure server endpoints

## Rust Server Example (Production-Grade)

### 7) x402-rs/x402-rs — Rust x402 implementation + middleware

**Repo:** https://github.com/x402-rs/x402-rs

- Rust implementation with server facilitator, middleware (x402-axum), and client tooling
- Not as high star count as the Coinbase repo, but a solid server and middleware example in the Rust ecosystem
- Includes a production-ready HTTP facilitator / verification service which is essentially a server component

- **Next.js projects**: Follow Polygon's seller quickstart
- **AI/Agent projects**: Reference thirdweb agent examples or DayDreams tutorials
- **MCP servers**: Follow Coinbase MCP server documentation
- **TypeScript/A2A**: Check out dabit3/a2a-x402-typescript
- **Rust projects**: Use x402-rs/x402-rs

## Implementation Approach

When helping build x402 integrations:
1. Understand the user's tech stack and choose appropriate middleware
2. Follow the seller quickstart pattern for basic setup
3. Implement facilitator integration for payment verification
4. Add proper error handling and security considerations
5. Test with x402scan or ecosystem tools
6. Reference real-world examples for production patterns
7. Point to specific GitHub repos based on the tech stack and use case
