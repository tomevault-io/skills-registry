# GitHub Copilot Agent Coordinator

This skill intelligently assigns GitHub issues to the most appropriate GitHub Copilot agent(s) based on issue type, labels, technical domain, and dependencies.

## When to Use This Skill

**Auto-trigger** when:

- User says: "Assign agents to these issues"
- User says: "Who should work on #123?"
- User says: "Route this to the right agent"
- User says: "Match agents to issues"
- After creating issues via `github-mcp-orchestrator` skill
- When reviewing a backlog and planning work assignment

**Manual trigger**:
- When you need to determine which Copilot agent is best suited for specific work
- When coordinating work across multiple specialized agents

## Mission

Analyze GitHub issues and assign them to the most appropriate GitHub Copilot agent(s) from the available agent pool. Ensure:

1. **Right agent for the right task** - Match issue requirements to agent expertise
2. **Dependency-aware assignment** - Respect issue dependencies and execution order
3. **No conflicts** - Don't assign blocked issues; wait for dependencies
4. **Clear handoff** - Provide context and acceptance criteria to agents
5. **Actual Copilot assignment** - Use `mcp__github__assign_copilot_to_issue` to assign agents automatically

## Available Agents

The repository has 25+ specialized GitHub Copilot agents. See `reference/agent-catalog.md` for the complete list and capabilities.

### Key Agent Categories

- **Frontend specialists**: React, Tailwind UI, shadcn components, mobile responsive
- **Backend specialists**: Express API, Drizzle database, authentication
- **Quality specialists**: Testing, code review, refactoring, performance
- **Integration specialists**: Spotify API, security, realtime features
- **DevOps specialists**: CI/CD, dependency management, git workflow
- **Documentation specialists**: README, API docs, accessibility

## Assignment Strategy

### 1. Parse Issue

Extract from the issue:
- **Type**: feature, bug, chore, test, docs
- **Area**: frontend, backend, database, infra, integration
- **Labels**: All assigned labels
- **Dependencies**: Blocked by or depends on other issues
- **Complexity**: Estimate from issue description and acceptance criteria

### 2. Match to Agent

Use the matching logic in `reference/agent-matching-rules.md`:

- **Type + Area combination** → Primary agent
- **Cross-cutting concerns** → Secondary agent(s)
- **Review requirements** → Add Code Review Specialist

**Examples**:
```
Issue: "Add user notification preferences UI"
Labels: type:feature, area:frontend, estimate:m
→ Primary: React Specialist
→ Secondary: Form Handling Specialist, Tailwind UI Specialist
→ Review: Code Review Specialist

Issue: "Fix database N+1 query in dashboard"
Labels: type:bug, area:database, priority:p1
→ Primary: Database Specialist
→ Secondary: Performance Specialist
→ Review: Code Review Specialist

Issue: "Add Playwright tests for checkout flow"
Labels: type:test, area:frontend, estimate:l
→ Primary: Testing Specialist
→ Secondary: Mobile Responsive Specialist
→ Review: Code Review Specialist
```

### 3. Check Dependencies

Before assignment:

- **If blocked**: Mark as `status:blocked`, do NOT assign agent
- **If unblocked**: Assign agent with `status:ready`
- **If in dependency chain**: Note execution order in issue comment

### 4. Assign Copilot Agent

For unblocked issues:

**A. Assign via GitHub API**
Use `mcp__github__assign_copilot_to_issue` to actually assign GitHub Copilot to the issue. This triggers the agent to start work.

**B. Add Assignment Comment**
Add a comment to the issue with context:

```markdown
## 🤖 Agent Assignment

**Assigned**: GitHub Copilot
**Specialist Mode**: [Agent Name] (e.g., React Specialist, Backend API Specialist)
**Supporting Context**: @[agent-name], @[agent-name]

### Context
[Brief summary of what needs to be done]

### Key Files to Focus On
- `path/to/file.ts`
- `path/to/component.tsx`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion from issue]
- [ ] [Additional criteria]

### Dependencies
- Depends on #123 (must complete first)
- Related to #124 (can work in parallel)

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for new functions
- E2E tests for user flow
- Manual testing checklist in issue

**Status**: ✅ Copilot assigned and ready to start
```

**C. Update Issue Labels**
Add `status:assigned` label to track assignment.

If blocked:
```markdown
## ⏳ Agent Assignment Pending

**Status**: 🚫 Blocked

This issue depends on:
- #123 Database schema changes
- #124 API endpoint implementation

**Planned Agent**: React Specialist (will assign when unblocked)
```

## Workflow

### 1. Intake

- Receive issue number(s) or list of issues to assign
- Fetch issue details via GitHub MCP
- Parse labels, description, acceptance criteria

### 2. Agent Discovery

- Read agent catalog from `reference/agent-catalog.md`
- Apply matching rules from `reference/agent-matching-rules.md`
- Consider multi-agent scenarios

### 3. Dependency Check

- Read dependency graph from issues
- Verify dependencies are complete
- Determine if issue is ready for assignment

### 4. Assignment

For each unblocked issue:

**A. Assign Copilot via API**
```javascript
mcp__github__assign_copilot_to_issue({
  owner: "{owner}",
  repo: "{repo}",
  issueNumber: 123
})
```

**B. Add Context Comment**
```javascript
mcp__github__add_issue_comment({
  owner: "{owner}",
  repo: "{repo}",
  issue_number: 123,
  body: "## 🤖 Agent Assignment\n\n**Assigned**: GitHub Copilot\n..."
})
```

**C. Update Labels**
Use `issue_write` method to add `status:assigned` label

**D. Track assignment** in output summary

### 5. Output Summary

Generate assignment report:

```
## Agent Assignment Summary

### Assigned (Ready to Start)
- #124 → Database Specialist (no blockers)
- #126 → React Specialist + Form Handling Specialist (no blockers)

### Blocked (Waiting on Dependencies)
- #125 → Backend API Specialist (blocked by #124)
- #127 → Testing Specialist (blocked by #125, #126)

### Execution Order
1. Start #124, #126 in parallel
2. After #124 completes → start #125
3. After #125 and #126 complete → start #127

### Next Steps
1. Agents can begin work on #124 and #126 immediately
2. Monitor #124 progress; assign #125 when complete
3. Monitor #125 and #126; assign #127 when both complete
```

## Assignment Rules

### Rule 1: One Primary Agent
- Every issue gets ONE primary agent responsible for implementation
- Primary agent "owns" the issue from start to finish

### Rule 2: Optional Supporting Agents
- Complex issues may need 1-2 supporting agents for specific expertise
- Supporting agents provide guidance, not full implementation

### Rule 3: Always Include Code Review
- Every code-producing issue must be reviewed by Code Review Specialist
- Review happens after implementation, before PR merge

### Rule 4: No Assignment When Blocked
- Never assign agents to blocked issues
- Track planned assignment for when dependencies clear

### Rule 5: Consider Cross-Cutting Concerns

Issues involving:
- **Security**: Always include Security Specialist
- **Performance**: Consider Performance Specialist for data-heavy features
- **Accessibility**: Include Accessibility Specialist for UI work
- **Mobile**: Include Mobile Responsive Specialist for responsive features

## Integration with Other Skills

### After github-mcp-orchestrator

When issues are created via the orchestrator skill:

1. Orchestrator creates epic + children
2. This skill (coordinator) automatically assigns agents
3. Output includes both issue map AND agent assignments

### Before copilot-workflow-orchestrator

When complex multi-agent workflows are needed:

1. This skill assigns agents to individual issues
2. Workflow orchestrator manages sequencing and handoffs
3. Progress tracker monitors execution

## Reference Documentation

- **Agent catalog**: See `reference/agent-catalog.md`
- **Matching rules**: See `reference/agent-matching-rules.md`
- **Assignment templates**: See `templates/assignment-comment.md`

## What This Skill Does

- Analyzes issues for technical domain and complexity
- Matches issues to best-fit Copilot agents
- Checks dependencies before assignment
- Creates agent assignment comments on issues
- Tracks assignment status across multiple issues
- Provides execution order recommendations

## What This Skill Doesn't Do

- Doesn't write code (agents do that)
- Doesn't manage agent execution (that's orchestrator)
- Doesn't review code (Code Review agent does that)
- Doesn't create issues (github-mcp-orchestrator does that)
