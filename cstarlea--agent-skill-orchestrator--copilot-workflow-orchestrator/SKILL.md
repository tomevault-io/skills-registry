# GitHub Copilot Workflow Orchestrator

This skill manages complex workflows involving multiple GitHub Copilot agents working on related issues. It handles sequencing, handoffs, dependency resolution, and progress tracking for coordinated multi-agent development.

## When to Use This Skill

**Auto-trigger** when:

- User says: "Orchestrate this workflow"
- User says: "Coordinate these agents"
- User says: "Manage multi-agent execution"
- User says: "Run these issues in sequence"
- After assigning agents to a complex epic with dependencies
- When a feature requires 3+ agents working in sequence

**Manual trigger**:
- Complex features with clear phases (backend → frontend → testing)
- Coordinated refactoring across multiple files/domains
- Large epics with dependency chains

## Mission

Coordinate multiple GitHub Copilot agents to work together on complex features:

1. **Define workflow phases** - Break work into sequential or parallel phases
2. **Manage handoffs** - Ensure smooth transitions between agents
3. **Monitor progress** - Track which agents have completed their work
4. **Unblock dependencies** - Automatically assign next agent when dependencies clear
5. **Ensure quality** - Coordinate reviews and testing throughout workflow

## Core Concepts

### Workflow
A coordinated sequence of work items (issues) with dependencies, assigned to appropriate agents.

### Phase
A logical grouping of work that can happen in parallel. Phases execute sequentially.

### Handoff
The transition point when one agent completes work and the next agent can start.

### Checkpoint
A verification point where progress is validated before proceeding to next phase.

## Workflow Types

See `workflows/` directory for pre-defined workflow templates:

### 1. Full-Stack Feature Workflow
```
Phase 1: Backend Foundation
  └─ Database Specialist → Schema changes

Phase 2: API Implementation
  └─ Backend API Specialist → Endpoints (depends on Phase 1)

Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
  ├─ React Specialist → Components (depends on Phase 2)
  └─ Tailwind UI Specialist → Styling (depends on Phase 2)

Phase 4: Integration & Testing
  ├─ State Management Specialist → Wire up data flow
  └─ Testing Specialist → E2E tests

Phase 5: Review & Polish

```

## Workflow Management

### 1. Workflow Creation

When creating a workflow:

```typescript
{
  id: "workflow-123",
  epic: "#150",
  name: "Spotify Playlist Integration",
  phases: [
    {
      name: "Authentication",
      issues: ["#151"],
      agents: ["Third-Party-API-Specialist", "Authentication-Specialist"],
      dependencies: [],
      checkpoint: "OAuth flow working, tokens stored"
    },
    {
      name: "API Implementation",
      issues: ["#152", "#153"],
      agents: ["Third-Party-API-Specialist", "Backend-API-Specialist"],
      dependencies: ["Phase 1"],
      checkpoint: "API endpoints return playlist data"
    },
    // ... more phases
  ],
  status: "in_progress",
  currentPhase: 1
}
```

### 2. Phase Execution

For each phase:

1. **Check dependencies** - Ensure previous phases complete via GitHub MCP
2. **Assign agents** - Use `mcp__github__assign_copilot_to_issue` for each issue
3. **Monitor progress** - Real-time PR monitoring via `mcp__github__pull_request_read`
   - Track PR creation (agents open PRs)
   - Monitor CI/CD checks status
   - Watch review comments
   - Detect when PR is merged
4. **Validate checkpoint** - Verify phase goals met
   - All issues closed
   - All PRs merged
   - Tests passing
   - Checkpoint criteria satisfied
5. **Proceed to next** - Trigger next phase automatically when ready

### 3. Handoff Management

When transitioning between phases:

```markdown
## Phase Handoff: Authentication → API Implementation

**Previous Phase**: Authentication ✅ Completed
- #151 merged in PR #200
- OAuth flow working
- Tokens stored securely

**Next Phase**: API Implementation 🚀 Starting
- Agents: @Third-Party-API-Specialist, @Backend-API-Specialist
- Issues: #152, #153
- Context: Use OAuth tokens from Phase 1 to make Spotify API calls

**Handoff Notes**:
- Token storage methods available in `server/storage.ts:456`
- OAuth callback route is `/api/spotify/callback`
- Access tokens expire after 1 hour, use refresh logic

**Checkpoint**: API endpoints should return playlist data successfully
```

### 4. Progress Tracking

Track workflow status:

```
Workflow: Spotify Playlist Integration (#150)
Status: Phase 2 of 4 (50% complete)

✅ Phase 1: Authentication (Completed 2 hours ago)
   - #151: Spotify OAuth flow → Merged in PR #200

🚀 Phase 2: API Implementation (In Progress)
   - #152: Playlist search API → PR #201 (in review)
   - #153: Track metadata API → Assigned, not started

⏳ Phase 3: Frontend (Blocked - waiting on Phase 2)
   - #154: Playlist browser UI
   - #155: Playback controls

⏳ Phase 4: Testing (Blocked - waiting on Phase 3)
   - #156: E2E tests for playlist flow
```

## Workflow Monitoring (Real-Time via GitHub MCP)

### Automatic Progress Detection

**Using GitHub MCP tools** to monitor in real-time:

- **PR creation** - Use `mcp__github__search_pull_requests` to find new PRs
- **PR status** - Use `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: "get"`
- **CI/CD checks** - Use `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: "get_status"`
- **Review status** - Use `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `method: "get_reviews"`
- **PR merge** - Detect when `pr.merged === true`
- **Issue status** - Use `mcp__github__issue_read` to check if closed

### Monitoring Loop

```javascript
// Poll every 5 minutes
while (!phaseComplete) {
  for (const issueNum of phaseIssues) {
    const issue = await mcp__github__issue_read({
      method: "get",
      owner: "{owner}",
      repo: "{repo}",
      issue_number: issueNum
    })

    // Check if issue has linked PR
    if (issue.pull_request) {
      const pr = await mcp__github__pull_request_read({
        method: "get",
        owner: "{owner}",
        repo: "{repo}",
        pullNumber: issue.pull_request.number
      })

      // Track progress
      if (pr.merged) {
        markIssueComplete(issueNum)
      }
    }
  }

  await sleep(300000) // 5 minutes
}
```

### Checkpoint Validation

Before moving to next phase, validate via GitHub MCP:

1. **All issues closed** - Use `mcp__github__issue_read` to verify `state === "closed"`
2. **All PRs merged** - Check `pr.merged === true` for each PR
3. **Tests passing** - Use `pull_request_read` with `method: "get_status"`
   - Verify all checks have `conclusion: "success"`
4. **No blocking issues** - Search for P0/P1 bugs created during phase
5. **Checkpoint criteria met** - Custom validation per workflow

### Progress Notifications

Update epic issue with progress:

```markdown
## Workflow Progress

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-15 14:30 UTC

### Phase 1: Authentication ✅
- #151 Completed (PR #200)

### Phase 2: API Implementation 🚀 IN PROGRESS
- #152 In Review (PR #201)
- #153 Not Started

### Phase 3: Frontend ⏳ BLOCKED
Waiting on #152, #153

### Phase 4: Testing ⏳ BLOCKED
Waiting on #154, #155

**Overall Progress**: 25% (1/4 phases complete)
**Estimated Completion**: 3-4 days remaining
```

## Conflict Resolution

### Agent Conflicts

When two agents need to modify the same file:

1. **Sequential assignment** - Assign agents in order
2. **Clear boundaries** - Define which agent owns which sections
3. **Communication** - Add notes about shared files in assignments

### Merge Conflicts

When PRs conflict:

1. **Detect conflict** - Monitor PR status
2. **Coordinate resolution** - Assign to agent who opened later PR
3. **Re-review** - Code Review Specialist reviews conflict resolution

### Blocking Issues

When new bugs block workflow:

1. **Create blocking issue** - File as P0/P1
2. **Pause workflow** - Mark current phase as blocked
3. **Assign fix** - Route to appropriate agent
4. **Resume** - Continue workflow when fixed

## Workflow Templates

Pre-defined workflows in `workflows/` directory:

- `full-stack-feature.md` - Complete backend + frontend feature
- `api-integration.md` - Third-party API integration
- `refactoring.md` - Safe code refactoring workflow
- `performance-optimization.md` - Performance improvement workflow
- `security-hardening.md` - Security improvement workflow
- `testing-pyramid.md` - Comprehensive test coverage workflow

## Integration with Other Skills

### After github-mcp-orchestrator + copilot-agent-coordinator

Typical flow:

1. **Orchestrator** creates epic + child issues
2. **Coordinator** assigns agents to issues
3. **Workflow Orchestrator** (this skill) manages execution sequencing
4. **PR Reviewer** reviews completed work

### Workflow Lifecycle

```
Issue Creation → Agent Assignment → Workflow Orchestration → PR Review → Merge
     ↑                ↑                      ↑                   ↑          ↑
     |                |                      |                   |          |
MCP Orchestrator  Agent Coordinator   Workflow Orchestrator  PR Reviewer  Done
```
