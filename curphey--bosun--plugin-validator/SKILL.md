description: Full plugin validation process for Bosun. Use when validating the entire plugin, checking plugin health, auditing agents and skills together, or preparing for release. Also use when checking cross-references between components, validating after major changes, onboarding to the Bosun codebase, or ensuring manifest, agents, skills, and commands work together. Essential before publishing or version bumps. Use when this capability is needed.

# Plugin Validator

## Overview

A valid plugin is a working plugin. This skill guides systematic validation of the entire Bosun plugin - manifest, agents, skills, and commands - and their cross-references.

**Core principle:** Validate the whole, not just the parts. Components must work together.

## The Validation Process

### Phase 1: Manifest Validation

Check `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:

1. **Structure**
   - Valid JSON syntax
   - Required fields present (name, version, description)
   - Version follows semver (x.y.z)

2. **File References**
   - All referenced agent files exist
   - All referenced command files exist
   - All referenced skill directories exist

### Phase 2: Agent Validation

Check each file in `agents/*.md`:

1. **Frontmatter**
   - Required: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`
   - Optional: `skills`, `disallowedTools`

2. **Model Selection**
   - `opus` - For critical work (security, architecture)
   - `sonnet` - For standard work (quality, docs)
   - `haiku` - For quick tasks

3. **Skill References**
   - All skills in `skills: [...]` exist in `skills/` directory
   - Skills match agent's purpose

4. **Tool Selection**
   - Tools are valid Claude Code tools
   - Read-only agents use `disallowedTools: Edit, Write`

### Phase 3: Skill Validation

Delegate to `skill-validator` skill for each skill, plus:

1. **Agent Coverage**
   - Which agents reference each skill?
   - Are any skills orphaned (no agent uses them)?

2. **Category Balance**
   - Domain skills (security, architect, testing, etc.)
   - Language skills (golang, typescript, python, etc.)
   - Cloud skills (aws, gcp, azure)

### Phase 4: Command Validation

Check each file in `commands/*.md`:

1. **Frontmatter**
   - Required: `name`, `description`

2. **Content**
   - Clear usage instructions
   - Example output shown
   - Error handling documented

### Phase 5: Cross-Reference Validation

Check relationships between components:

1. **Skill-Agent Mapping**
   - All skills referenced by agents exist
   - Identify orphaned skills
   - Identify agents with no skills

2. **Consistency**
   - Naming conventions followed
   - No duplicate names across components

## Red Flags - STOP and Fix

### Manifest Red Flags
```json
// ❌ Invalid JSON
{ name: "bosun" }  // Missing quotes

// ❌ Missing version
{ "name": "bosun", "description": "..." }

// ❌ Invalid semver
{ "version": "1.0" }  // Should be "1.0.0"
```

### Agent Red Flags
```yaml
# ❌ Missing required field
name: security-agent
description: "..."
# Missing: tools, model

# ❌ Invalid model
model: gpt-4  # Should be opus, sonnet, or haiku

# ❌ Non-existent skill
skills: [nonexistent]

# ❌ Read-only agent with write tools
disallowedTools: Edit  # Missing Write
```

### Cross-Reference Red Flags
```
- Agent references skill that doesn't exist
- Skill exists but no agent uses it
- Command references non-existent agent
- Duplicate component names
```

## Common Rationalizations - Don't Accept These

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "The orphaned skill will be used later" | Remove it or assign it now. |
| "The agent doesn't need skills" | Every agent should leverage skills. |
| "The manifest is auto-generated" | Still validate it. Automation fails. |
| "Cross-references are obvious" | Make them explicit and verified. |

## Validation Checklist

Before approving the plugin:

**Manifest:**
- [ ] Valid JSON syntax
- [ ] Version follows semver
- [ ] All referenced files exist

**Agents:**
- [ ] All have required frontmatter fields
- [ ] Model is valid (opus/sonnet/haiku)
- [ ] Referenced skills exist
- [ ] Tools are valid

**Skills:**
- [ ] All pass skill-validator checks
- [ ] No orphaned skills (or documented why)
- [ ] Good category coverage

**Commands:**
- [ ] All have required frontmatter
- [ ] Usage documented
- [ ] Error handling covered

**Cross-References:**
- [ ] All skill references resolve
- [ ] No duplicate names
- [ ] Naming conventions followed

## Quick Validation Commands

```bash
# Validate manifest JSON
jq . .claude-plugin/plugin.json

# List all agents
ls agents/*.md

# List all skills
ls -d skills/*/

# List all commands
ls commands/*.md

# Find skills referenced by agents
grep -h "^skills:" agents/*.md

# Find orphaned skills (not in any agent)
comm -23 <(ls -d skills/*/ | xargs -n1 basename | sort) \
         <(grep -h "^skills:" agents/*.md | tr '[],' '\n' | grep bosun | sort -u)
```

## Validation Output Format

When validating, report findings like this:

```
Bosun Plugin Validation
=======================

Manifest (.claude-plugin/plugin.json)
  ✓ Valid JSON
  ✓ Version: 1.0.0
  ✓ All file references valid

Agents (9 files)
  ✓ security-agent (opus, 2 skills)
  ✓ quality-agent (sonnet, 4 skills)
  ✓ architecture-agent (opus, 2 skills)
  ... all valid

Skills (20 directories)
  ✓ 18/20 valid
  ✗ security: missing reference security-headers.md
  ✗ architect: missing references api-design.md, architecture-patterns.md

Commands (3 files)
  ✓ All valid

Cross-References
  ⚠ Orphaned skills: rust, java, csharp
    (exist but not assigned to any agent)

Overall: PASS with warnings
```
