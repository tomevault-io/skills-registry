description: Skill validation process for Bosun plugin skills. Use when validating skills, checking skill quality, reviewing skill structure, or auditing skill references. Also use when creating a new Bosun skill, checking frontmatter format, validating referenced files exist, ensuring skills follow naming conventions, or auditing all skills before release. Essential for skill authors and plugin quality assurance. Use when this capability is needed.

# Skill Validator

## Overview

Skills are Bosun's knowledge packages. Invalid skills break the plugin. This skill guides systematic validation of Bosun skills before they ship.

**Core principle:** Validate early, validate often. A malformed skill wastes everyone's time.

## The Validation Process

### Phase 1: Frontmatter Validation

Check the YAML frontmatter at the top of SKILL.md:

1. **Required Fields**
   - `name` - Must be present, must be `{purpose}` format
   - `description` - Must be present, must include trigger phrases

2. **Forbidden Fields**
   - `tags` - Removed per skill-creator spec
   - Any field other than `name` and `description`

3. **Description Quality**
   - Includes "Use when..." trigger phrases
   - 50-100 words (comprehensive but concise)
   - No angle brackets (< or >)

### Phase 2: Structure Validation

Check the SKILL.md body structure:

1. **Required Sections**
   - Overview with core principle
   - "When to Use" or similar trigger section
   - Red Flags section
   - Checklist section
   - Quick Commands or Quick Patterns

2. **Length Check**
   - SKILL.md should be < 500 lines
   - If approaching limit, content should be in references/

3. **Code Examples**
   - Use ✅/❌ or checkmark/X pattern for good/bad
   - Examples should be practical and runnable

### Phase 3: Reference Validation

Check the references/ directory:

1. **Cited References Exist**
   - Every file mentioned in SKILL.md References section exists
   - Check: `references/{filename}.md`

2. **No Orphaned References**
   - Every file in references/ is cited in SKILL.md
   - Orphaned files waste space and cause confusion

3. **Naming Convention**
   - Files should be `{topic}.md` or `{topic}-patterns.md`
   - Avoid `{skill}-research.md` pattern

## Red Flags - STOP and Fix

### Frontmatter Red Flags
```yaml
# ❌ Has tags field (removed from spec)
tags: [security, owasp]

# ❌ Missing description
name: security

# ❌ Wrong naming pattern
name: security-skill  # Should be security

# ❌ No trigger phrases in description
description: "Security stuff"  # Should include "Use when..."
```

### Structure Red Flags
```
- SKILL.md over 500 lines (move content to references/)
- Missing Red Flags section (every skill needs warnings)
- Missing Checklist (users need actionable checks)
- No code examples (skills should show, not just tell)
- Deeply nested headers (keep it flat: h1 → h2 → h3 max)
```

### Reference Red Flags
```
- "See references/foo.md" but foo.md doesn't exist
- references/ has files never mentioned in SKILL.md
- Research files with no clear topic ({skill}-research.md)
```

## Common Rationalizations - Don't Accept These

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Tags help discovery" | Description triggers skills. Tags are ignored. |
| "The skill is too long" | Move details to references/. Keep SKILL.md lean. |
| "References will be added later" | Don't cite what doesn't exist. |
| "The description is fine" | If it lacks "Use when...", Claude won't trigger it. |

## Validation Checklist

Before approving a skill:

**Frontmatter:**
- [ ] Only `name` and `description` fields
- [ ] Name follows `{purpose}` pattern
- [ ] Description includes trigger phrases ("Use when...")
- [ ] Description is 50-100 words

**Structure:**
- [ ] SKILL.md is < 500 lines
- [ ] Has Overview with core principle
- [ ] Has Red Flags section
- [ ] Has Checklist section
- [ ] Has Quick Commands/Patterns section
- [ ] Code examples use ✅/❌ pattern

**References:**
- [ ] All cited references exist in references/
- [ ] No orphaned files in references/
- [ ] Reference naming follows convention

## Quick Validation Commands

```bash
# Check frontmatter for forbidden fields
head -10 skills/*/SKILL.md | grep -E "^tags:"

# Count lines in each skill
wc -l skills/*/SKILL.md | sort -n

# Find skills over 400 lines (approaching limit)
wc -l skills/*/SKILL.md | awk '$1 > 400 {print}'

# List all reference files
ls skills/*/references/*.md

# Find cited references in a skill
grep -o 'references/[^`]*\.md' skills/security/SKILL.md
```

## Validation Output Format

When validating, report findings like this:

```
Validating security...
  ✓ Frontmatter valid
  ✓ Structure valid (178 lines)
  ✓ References valid (4 cited, 4 exist)

Validating architect...
  ✓ Frontmatter valid
  ✓ Structure valid (199 lines)
  ✗ Missing reference: api-design.md
  ✗ Missing reference: architecture-patterns.md

Summary: 18/20 skills valid, 2 with issues
```
