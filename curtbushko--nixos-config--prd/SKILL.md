# PRD (Product Requirements Document) Writing Skill

This skill provides guidance for creating high-quality PRDs that clearly define problems and requirements.

## What is a PRD?

A **Problem Requirements Document (PRD)** helps team members fully understand a problem and define what's needed to address it. Unlike solution-focused documents, a PRD grounds decisions in real, researched user problems.

**Key principle**: Start with the problem, not the solution. Teams that begin with a UI idea or solution tend to bias engineering design and miss the actual user needs.

## PRD Template Structure (HashiCorp Format)

### 1. Introduction

**Purpose**: Provide a brief executive summary of the PRD.

**Important**: Write this section LAST. Writing the introduction after completing the rest allows you to accurately summarize the final content rather than guessing at an unknown result.

Include:
- One-paragraph summary of the problem
- Who is affected
- Why this matters now
- Link to related documents (RFCs, previous PRDs)

```markdown
## Introduction

This PRD addresses [problem] affecting [personas]. Based on research with
[N] users, we identified [key insight]. This work supports [strategic goal]
and is targeted for [timeframe].

**Related Documents**:
- RFC: [link]
- User Research: [link]
```

### 2. Background

**Purpose**: Provide context so readers can understand the problem domain before diving into specifics.

Include:
- Current state of the system/product
- Historical context and previous attempts
- Technical constraints or dependencies
- Market/competitive context (if relevant)
- Glossary of domain-specific terms

```markdown
## Background

### Current State
[Describe how things work today]

### Historical Context
[Previous attempts to solve this, why they succeeded/failed]

### Technical Landscape
[Relevant systems, dependencies, constraints]

### Glossary
- **Term**: Definition
```

### 3. Problem Statement / User Research

**Purpose**: This is the HEART of the PRD. Simplify user research into clear problem statements.

**Quality of this section determines PRD quality**. The better the research, the easier it is to identify patterns and create clear problem statements.

#### Conducting User Research

1. **Gather qualitative data**: User interviews, support tickets, feedback
2. **Identify patterns**: Common complaints, workflows, pain points
3. **Define personas**: Who experiences these problems?
4. **Prioritize**: Which problems are most impactful?

#### Writing Problem Statements

Each problem statement should:
- Clearly describe WHAT the problem is
- Identify WHO it affects (persona)
- Explain WHY it's important to solve
- Be supported by research data

```markdown
## Problem Statement

### User Research Summary

We conducted [N] interviews with [personas] between [dates].

| Persona | # Interviewed | Key Pain Points |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| DevOps Engineer | 8 | Manual config, no visibility |
| Platform Admin | 5 | Scaling issues, alert fatigue |

### Problem 1: [Descriptive Title]

**Affected Persona**: [Who]

**Problem**: [Clear description of the problem from user's perspective]

**Evidence**:
- "Quote from user interview" - User A
- Support ticket volume: X tickets/month
- [Metric showing impact]

**Impact**: [Business/user impact if not solved]

### Problem 2: [Descriptive Title]
[Same structure]
```

### 4. Phases and Requirements

**Purpose**: Define objectives for solving the problem, organized into phases.

#### Phase Structure

Each phase:
- Focuses on a single problem from the user's perspective
- May contain multiple requirements to address specific components
- Should reference the persona in the title

#### Requirement Format

```markdown
## Phases and Requirements

### Phase 1: [Objective referencing persona]

Example: "Make it easier for policy writers to create Terraform mock data"

#### Requirement 1.1: [Specific Component/Feature]

**Description**: [What needs to be built/changed]

**User Story**: As a [persona], I want [goal] so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 3]

**Out of Scope**: [Explicitly list what this does NOT include]

#### Requirement 1.2: [Next Component]
[Same structure]

### Phase 2: [Next Objective]
[Same structure]
```

### 5. Acceptance Criteria

**Purpose**: Define testable conditions that must be met for requirements to be considered complete.

**Key principle**: Write acceptance criteria like test cases.

#### SMART Criteria

Acceptance criteria must be:
- **S**pecific: Clear and unambiguous
- **M**easurable: Can be verified objectively
- **A**chievable: Technically feasible
- **R**elevant: Directly addresses the requirement
- **T**ime-bound: Has a clear completion state

#### Given/When/Then Format

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

### Requirement 1.1 Criteria

**Criterion 1**: User can create mock data from existing policy
- **Given**: A user has an existing Sentinel policy
- **When**: They click "Generate Mock Data"
- **Then**: The system creates valid mock data matching the policy schema

**Criterion 2**: Error handling for invalid policies
- **Given**: A user has a malformed policy
- **When**: They attempt to generate mock data
- **Then**: The system displays a specific error message indicating the issue
```

### 6. Success Metrics

**Purpose**: Define how we'll measure if the solution actually solves the problem.

Include:
- Quantitative metrics (adoption, performance, reduction in X)
- Qualitative metrics (user satisfaction, NPS)
- Baseline measurements
- Target values
- Measurement method

```markdown
## Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Time to create mock data | 45 min | < 5 min | User testing |
| Support tickets (mock data) | 50/month | < 10/month | Zendesk |
| User satisfaction | 3.2/5 | > 4.0/5 | In-app survey |
```

### 7. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

**Purpose**: Explicitly state what this PRD does NOT address to prevent scope creep.

```markdown
## Non-Goals

The following are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this PRD:

1. **[Item]**: [Brief reason why it's excluded]
2. **[Item]**: [Will be addressed in future phase/separate PRD]
3. **[Item]**: [Not aligned with current objectives]
```

### 8. Stakeholder Sign-off

**Purpose**: Ensure alignment before proceeding to implementation.

**Requirements for sign-off**:
1. Release summary defines which acceptance criteria are in scope
2. Engineering and Product Management agree on target release
3. All representative stakeholders have reviewed

```markdown
## Stakeholder Sign-off

| Role | Name | Status | Date | Notes |
|------|------|--------|------|-------|
| Product Manager | | [ ] Approved | | |
| Engineering Lead | | [ ] Approved | | |
| Design Lead | | [ ] Approved | | |
| [Other Stakeholder] | | [ ] Approved | | |

### Sign-off Checklist

- [ ] All stakeholders have reviewed the PRD
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are agreed upon
- [ ] Target release/timeline is confirmed
- [ ] Resources are allocated
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and communicated
```

## PRD Best Practices

### Do

- Start with user research, not solutions
- Write the introduction last
- Make acceptance criteria testable
- Include explicit non-goals
- Get stakeholder sign-off before implementation
- Keep the document living and updated
- Use clear, specific language with quantities where possible

### Don't

- Begin with a UI mockup or solution idea
- Write acceptance criteria that can't be objectively verified
- Skip user research or rely on assumptions
- Leave scope ambiguous
- Proceed without stakeholder alignment
- Create overly rigid specifications that can't adapt

### Common Mistakes

1. **Solution-first thinking**: Jumping to "we need a button that..." before understanding the problem
2. **Vague criteria**: "System should be fast" instead of "Response time < 200ms"
3. **Missing personas**: Not identifying who experiences the problem
4. **No evidence**: Problem statements without research backing
5. **Scope creep**: Not explicitly defining what's out of scope

## PRD Review Checklist

Before finalizing a PRD, verify:

- [ ] Introduction accurately summarizes the document
- [ ] Background provides sufficient context for any reader
- [ ] Problem statements are backed by user research
- [ ] Each problem maps to a specific persona
- [ ] Requirements clearly address the stated problems
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are SMART and testable
- [ ] Success metrics have baselines and targets
- [ ] Non-goals are explicitly stated
- [ ] All stakeholders are identified
- [ ] Document is clear enough for someone unfamiliar to understand

## Agile PRD Considerations

For Agile teams, the PRD becomes a living document:

- **User Stories**: Requirements can be expressed as user stories
- **Epics**: Large requirements become epics broken into stories
- **Iteration**: PRD evolves as understanding deepens
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Map directly to definition of done

```markdown
### User Story Format

**Epic**: [High-level capability]

**Story**: As a [persona], I want [goal] so that [benefit]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [result]
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [result]

**Story Points**: [Estimate]
```
