# RFC (Request for Comments) Writing Skill

This skill provides guidance for creating effective RFCs that propose solutions and drive consensus through collaborative feedback.

## What is an RFC?

A **Request for Comments (RFC)** is a formal written document that proposes a solution to a problem and seeks feedback on that proposal. Unlike a PRD which focuses on the problem, an RFC focuses on the solution.

**Key principle**: An RFC facilitates feedback and drives consensus. It is not a tool for approving or committing to ideas, but a collaborative practice to shape an idea and find serious flaws early.

## When to Use an RFC

**Use an RFC when:**
- A change will affect many stakeholders
- Proposing a significant technical solution
- Seeking thoughtful feedback across distributed teams
- Making important cross-functional decisions
- The implementation approach needs validation

**Skip an RFC when:**
- The change is trivial or well-understood
- You're the sole decider without needing input
- A quick discussion would suffice

## RFC vs PRD

| Document | Focus | When to Write |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| PRD | The **problem** and requirements | Before solution design |
| RFC | The **solution** and implementation | After problem is understood |

A PRD answers: "What problem are we solving and why?"
An RFC answers: "How will we solve it?"

## RFC Template Structure (HashiCorp Format)

### 1. Metadata

```markdown
# [RFC] Title: Brief Description of Proposal

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Created** | [Date] |
| **Current Version** | [Version] |
| **Target Version** | [Version] |
| **PRD** | [Link if applicable] |
| **Status** | WIP / In-Review / Approved / Obsolete |
| **Owner** | [Name] |
| **Contributors** | [Names] |
```

### Status Labels

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **WIP** | Still drafting; not ready for review |
| **In-Review** | Ready for feedback from stakeholders |
| **Approved** | Decision finalized, ready for implementation |
| **Implemented** | Proposal executed |
| **Obsolete** | Superseded by another RFC |
| **Abandoned** | Decision made not to proceed |

### 2. Overview

**Purpose**: Provide a brief executive summary (1-2 paragraphs).

**Important**: Anyone opening the document should form a clear understanding of the RFC's intent from reading this section alone.

Include:
- What this RFC proposes (high-level)
- The goal or outcome expected
- NOT the detailed "why", "why now", or "how"

```markdown
## Overview

This RFC proposes [solution] to address [problem summary]. The expected
outcome is [benefit/goal]. This change will affect [scope/systems].
```

### 3. Background

**Purpose**: Provide full context so any reader can understand why this RFC is necessary.

**Key test**: If you can't show a random engineer the background section and have them acquire nearly full context on the necessity for the RFC, the background is not complete enough.

Include:
- Current state of the system
- Why this change is needed now
- Links to prior RFCs, discussions, PRDs
- Historical context and previous attempts
- Technical constraints

```markdown
## Background

### Current State
[How things work today. What exists. The status quo.]

### Problem Context
[Why the current state is insufficient. Link to PRD if available.]

### Prior Work
[Previous RFCs, discussions, or attempts. What was learned.]

### Constraints
[Technical, organizational, or time constraints affecting the solution.]

**Related Documents**:
- PRD: [link]
- Previous RFC: [link]
- Discussion: [link]
```

### 4. Proposal / Goal

**Purpose**: Given the background, propose the solution.

This section provides an overview of the "how" without diving into implementation details (those come in the next section).

```markdown
## Proposal

### Goal
[What we're trying to achieve with this solution]

### Proposed Solution
[Overview of the approach. High-level description of how it works.]

### Key Design Decisions
1. **[Decision 1]**: [Rationale]
2. **[Decision 2]**: [Rationale]
3. **[Decision 3]**: [Rationale]

### Scope
- **In Scope**: [What this RFC covers]
- **Out of Scope**: [What this RFC does NOT cover]
```

### 5. Implementation

**Purpose**: Detail how the implementation will work.

Include:
- API changes (internal and external)
- Package/module changes
- Data model changes
- Subsystems affected
- Surface area of changes

```markdown
## Implementation

### Architecture Overview
[High-level architecture diagram or description]

### Component Changes

#### [Component 1]
**Current**: [How it works now]
**Proposed**: [How it will work]
**Changes Required**:
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

#### [Component 2]
[Same structure]

### API Changes

#### New Endpoints/Methods
```
POST /api/v1/widgets
Request: { "name": string, "config": object }
Response: { "id": string, "status": string }
```

#### Modified Endpoints/Methods
[Existing API changes]

#### Deprecated Endpoints/Methods
[What will be deprecated and timeline]

### Data Model Changes
[Database schema changes, new tables, migrations]

### Dependencies
[External dependencies, services, libraries]
```

### 6. UI/UX (If Applicable)

**Purpose**: Document user-impacting changes.

Include any changes to:
- External API surface
- Configuration formats
- CLI output
- User interfaces
- Error messages

```markdown
## UI/UX

### User-Facing Changes

#### CLI Changes
```
# Before
$ tool config --format json

# After
$ tool config --format json --validate
```

#### Configuration Changes
```yaml
# New configuration option
widgets:
  enabled: true
  max_count: 100
```

#### Error Message Changes
[New or modified error messages users will see]

### Migration Guide
[How users migrate from old to new behavior]

### Documentation Updates Required
- [ ] [Doc page 1]
- [ ] [Doc page 2]
```

### 7. Rollout Plan

**Purpose**: Describe how this will be deployed and validated.

```markdown
## Rollout Plan

### Phases

#### Phase 1: [Description]
- **Timeline**: [Dates]
- **Scope**: [What's included]
- **Success Criteria**: [How we know it worked]
- **Rollback Plan**: [How to revert if needed]

#### Phase 2: [Description]
[Same structure]

### Feature Flags
[Any feature flags used for gradual rollout]

### Monitoring
[Metrics and alerts to watch during rollout]
```

### 8. Testing Strategy

**Purpose**: Describe how the solution will be validated.

```markdown
## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
[Key unit test scenarios]

### Integration Tests
[Integration test approach]

### Performance Tests
[Load testing, benchmarks]

### Manual Testing
[Manual validation steps]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
```

### 9. Security Considerations

**Purpose**: Address security implications.

```markdown
## Security Considerations

### Threat Model
[What threats does this introduce or mitigate?]

### Authentication/Authorization
[Changes to auth model]

### Data Handling
[Sensitive data considerations]

### Audit/Compliance
[Audit trail, compliance requirements]
```

### 10. Abandoned Ideas

**Purpose**: Document ideas that were considered but rejected.

**Important**: Don't delete abandoned ideas from the document. Organize them with explanations of why they were abandoned. This preserves the reasoning for future readers.

```markdown
## Abandoned Ideas

### [Idea 1 Title]

**Description**: [What was proposed]

**Why Abandoned**: [Reason it was rejected]

**Discussion**: [Link to relevant discussion if any]

### [Idea 2 Title]
[Same structure]
```

### 11. Open Questions

**Purpose**: List unresolved questions that need input.

```markdown
## Open Questions

1. **[Question]**
   - Context: [Why this matters]
   - Options: [Possible answers]
   - Owner: [Who will decide]

2. **[Question]**
   [Same structure]
```

### 12. References

```markdown
## References

- [Related RFC 1](link)
- [External documentation](link)
- [Research/papers](link)
```

## RFC Best Practices

### Writing

- **Background is critical**: If a newcomer can't understand why this RFC exists from the background section alone, it's incomplete
- **Link liberally**: Reference prior RFCs, discussions, PRDs, and documentation
- **Be specific**: Include API signatures, data structures, configuration examples
- **Show your work**: Document abandoned ideas so readers understand the decision process

### Process

- **Share early**: Get feedback while still in WIP status
- **Invite the right reviewers**: Identify stakeholders who will be affected
- **Iterate openly**: Update the RFC based on feedback
- **Don't rush approval**: Consensus takes time in async environments

### Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping background**: Assuming readers know the context
2. **Solution without problem**: Proposing a fix without establishing what's broken
3. **Missing abandoned ideas**: Deleting rejected approaches instead of documenting them
4. **Vague implementation**: "We'll figure it out" instead of concrete details
5. **No rollback plan**: Assuming everything will work perfectly

## RFC Review Checklist
