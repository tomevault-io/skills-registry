2. Closes issue with reason: completed
```

## Safety Guidelines

1. **Confirm destructive actions** — Always confirm before closing or deleting
2. **Show before create** — Display issue content before creating
3. **Preserve context** — When updating, show what will change
4. **Rate limit awareness** — Don't spam the API with many requests
