# Decisions

Projects may have a `decisions.md` file for recording significant decisions.

## When to Record Decisions

Record a decision when:
- A significant choice was made after considering alternatives
- The decision affects future work (even if no code was written)
- You'd want to remember "why did we decide this?" later

Do NOT record:
- Exploration or experiments that didn't pan out
- Routine implementation choices
- Decisions still being discussed

## Recording Format

Append to the project's `decisions.md`:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD: Brief Title
Context: [What prompted this decision]
Decision: [What we decided]
Rationale: [Why we chose this]
```

## Example

```markdown
# Decisions

## 2026-01-31: Use plugin architecture
Context: Wanted easier installation and portability for other users
Decision: Convert from install script to Claude Code plugin
Rationale: Plugins have one-line install, discoverable commands, and built-in distribution

## 2026-01-31: Save context on project switch
Context: Switching projects mid-session loses context about what was done
Decision: Write summary to CLAUDE.local.md when switching away from a project
Rationale: Captures context at the right moment, survives crashes, complements SessionEnd hook
```

## On Resume

When resuming a project:
- Read `decisions.md` if it exists
- Reference relevant past decisions when they affect current work

## Timing

Only record after the decision is confirmed and being acted on, not during exploration.
