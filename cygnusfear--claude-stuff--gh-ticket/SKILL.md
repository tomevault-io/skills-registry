name: gh-ticket
description: Create or update comprehensive GitHub issues that capture ALL context, requirements, and implementation details. Use when creating or updating tickets, issues, feature requests, or bug reports. Ensures no context is lost between ticket creation and implementation - the moment you ask for a ticket, there's maximum context available that will be lost if not captured now. Use when this capability is needed.

# GitHub Ticket (Create or Update)

## Why This Skill Exists

**The moment you decide to create a ticket, you have MAXIMUM CONTEXT.**

- You just investigated the problem
- You understand the codebase state
- You know the requirements
- You have the error messages fresh
- You understand the dependencies

**If you don't capture this NOW, it's lost forever.** The implementer (even if it's you later) will have to re-discover everything.

## The Cost of Vague Tickets

| Vague Ticket | Cost |
|--------------|------|
| "Fix auth bug" | Implementer spends 2 hours finding which bug |
| "Add user settings" | 5 back-and-forth clarifications |
| "Improve performance" | Implementation doesn't match intent |
| "Handle edge case" | Which edge case? What behavior? |

**Every minute spent writing a good ticket saves 10 minutes of implementation confusion.**

---

## When to Use This Skill

- **Creating** a new GitHub issue
- **Updating** an existing issue with new context/requirements
- **Expanding** a vague issue into a comprehensive spec
- **Adding** implementation details discovered during investigation

---

## Ticket Process (Create or Update)

### Phase 1: Context Capture (DO THIS FIRST)

Before writing anything, gather ALL available context:

#### Step 1: Dump Current Context

Ask yourself and document:

```markdown
## Context Dump (will be refined)

### What triggered this?
- [User request? Bug report? Code review finding? Your own observation?]

### What do I know right now?
- [Everything in your head about this issue]

### What files are involved?
- [List every file you've looked at or that's relevant]

### What did I discover?
- [Findings from investigation, errors seen, behavior observed]

### What's the current state?
- [How does it work now? What's broken?]

### What should the end state be?
- [Desired behavior, expected outcome]
```

#### Step 2: Gather Technical Evidence

```bash
# If there's an error, capture it
# If there are relevant files, note their paths
# If there's relevant git history, capture it
git log --oneline -10 -- path/to/relevant/file

# If there's related code, note the exact locations
grep -n "relevant_function" src/**/*.ts
```

#### Step 3: Check for Related Context

```bash
# Related issues?
gh issue list --search "related keywords"

# Related PRs?
gh pr list --search "related keywords"

# Any existing documentation?
find . -name "*.md" | xargs grep -l "related topic"
```

---

### Phase 2: Requirements Extraction

**CRITICAL**: Extract EVERY requirement as a checkbox item.

#### Functional Requirements

What must the implementation DO?

```markdown
## Requirements

### Functional
- [ ] [Specific action/behavior 1]
- [ ] [Specific action/behavior 2]
- [ ] [Specific action/behavior 3]
```

**Rules for writing requirements:**
- Start with a verb (Create, Add, Update, Remove, Fix, Handle)
- Be specific (not "handle errors" but "return 400 with validation message when email invalid")
- One requirement per checkbox
- If it's complex, break it down

#### Edge Cases

What edge cases must be handled?

```markdown
### Edge Cases
- [ ] Handle empty input: [expected behavior]
- [ ] Handle null/undefined: [expected behavior]
- [ ] Handle network failure: [expected behavior]
- [ ] Handle concurrent access: [expected behavior]
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

How do we KNOW it's done?

```markdown
### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion 2]
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Linting passes
```

---

### Phase 3: Implementation Guidance

Give the implementer a head start with everything you know.

#### Affected Files

```markdown
## Implementation Notes

### Files to Modify
- `src/services/auth.ts` - Add token refresh logic
- `src/api/handlers/login.ts` - Update error responses
- `src/types/auth.ts` - Add new type for refresh token

### Files to Create
- `src/services/token-refresh.ts` - New service for refresh logic

### Files to Delete
- `src/utils/old-auth-helper.ts` - Replaced by new service
```

#### Relevant Code Locations

```markdown
### Key Code Locations

**Entry point**: `src/api/handlers/login.ts:45` - `handleLogin()`
**Token generation**: `src/services/auth.ts:120` - `generateToken()`
**Related type**: `src/types/auth.ts:15` - `AuthToken`

**Similar pattern exists in**: `src/services/session.ts:80` - follow this pattern
```

#### Dependencies & Blockers

```markdown
### Dependencies
- Depends on: #123 (database migration must be done first)
- Blocks: #456 (this must be done before that can start)
- Related to: #789 (similar work, coordinate)

### Blockers
- [ ] Waiting on API spec from backend team
- [ ] Need design mockup for UI
```

---

### Phase 4: Ticket Structure Template

Use this exact structure for every ticket:

```markdown
## Summary

[1-2 sentence description of what this ticket accomplishes]

## Context

### Background
[Why does this need to happen? What triggered this?]

### Current State
[How does it work now? What's the problem?]

### Desired State
[How should it work after implementation?]

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] [Requirement 1 - specific, actionable]
- [ ] [Requirement 2 - specific, actionable]
- [ ] [Requirement 3 - specific, actionable]

### Edge Cases
- [ ] [Edge case 1]: [expected behavior]
- [ ] [Edge case 2]: [expected behavior]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1 - testable]
- [ ] [Criterion 2 - testable]
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Code review approved

## Implementation Notes

### Files to Modify
- `path/to/file1.ts` - [what changes]
- `path/to/file2.ts` - [what changes]

### Files to Create
- `path/to/new-file.ts` - [purpose]

### Files to Delete
- `path/to/old-file.ts` - [why removing]

### Key Code Locations
- `file.ts:line` - [relevant function/class]
- `file.ts:line` - [related code to reference]

### Suggested Approach
[If you have ideas on HOW to implement, share them]

### Similar Patterns
[Point to existing code that solves similar problems]

## Dependencies

- Depends on: [#issue or description]
- Blocks: [#issue or description]
- Related: [#issue or description]

## Out of Scope

[Explicitly list what this ticket does NOT cover to prevent scope creep]

- Not doing X (that's #456)
- Not changing Y (separate ticket needed)

## Technical Notes

[Any technical context that helps: error messages, stack traces, config values, environment details]

```

---

### Phase 5: Create or Update the Ticket

#### Creating a New Issue

```bash
# Create with full body using heredoc
gh issue create --title "[Type]: Brief description" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
[Full ticket body here using template above]
EOF
)"

# Or create from file
echo "[ticket content]" > /tmp/ticket.md
gh issue create --title "[Type]: Brief description" --body-file /tmp/ticket.md

# Add labels
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "type:feature,priority:high"
```

#### Updating an Existing Issue

```bash
# View current issue content
gh issue view <number>

# Update issue body (replaces entire body)
gh issue edit <number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
[Updated full ticket body]
EOF
)"

# Update just the title
gh issue edit <number> --title "[Type]: Updated description"

# Add a comment with new context (preserves original body)
gh issue comment <number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Additional Context Discovered

[New findings, updated requirements, implementation notes]
EOF
)"

# Add labels
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "type:feature,priority:high"
```

#### When to Update vs Comment

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Issue was vague, now have full spec | **Update body** - replace with complete spec |
| Found new requirements during investigation | **Update body** - add to requirements section |
| Progress update or status change | **Comment** - preserve history |
| Minor clarification | **Comment** - don't rewrite whole issue |
| Issue scope changed significantly | **Update body** - rewrite with new scope |

#### Title Format

```
[Type]: Brief, specific description

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- refactor: Code restructuring
- docs: Documentation
- test: Testing
- chore: Maintenance

Examples:
- feat: Add token refresh for expired sessions
- fix: Handle null response in user API
- refactor: Extract auth logic into dedicated service
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Vague Requirements

```markdown
❌ WRONG:
- [ ] Fix the authentication

✅ CORRECT:
- [ ] Return 401 when access token is expired (currently returns 500)
- [ ] Include `token_expired` error code in response body
- [ ] Log failed auth attempts with user ID and timestamp
```

### Missing Context

```markdown
❌ WRONG:
## Summary
Add user settings

✅ CORRECT:
## Summary
Add user settings page with theme, notification, and privacy preferences.

## Context
### Background
Users have requested ability to customize their experience. Currently all settings
are hardcoded. Design mockup approved in Figma (link).

### Current State
No user settings exist. Theme is system default, notifications always on.

### Desired State
Users can: toggle dark mode, enable/disable notifications, set privacy level.
Settings persist across sessions in user profile.
```

### Assumed Knowledge

```markdown
❌ WRONG:
Fix the thing we discussed

✅ CORRECT:
Fix the race condition in WebSocket reconnection.

Per discussion on 2024-01-15: when connection drops and reconnects rapidly,
duplicate event handlers accumulate. See error in production logs:
"MaxListenersExceededWarning: 11 listeners added to connection"
```

### No Acceptance Criteria

```markdown
❌ WRONG:
- [ ] Add caching

✅ CORRECT:
- [ ] Add Redis caching for user profile queries
- [ ] Cache TTL: 5 minutes
- [ ] Cache invalidates on profile update
- [ ] Cache miss falls back to database
- [ ] Metric: Cache hit rate logged to DataDog
- [ ] Acceptance: Profile page loads in <100ms (currently 400ms)
```

## Examples

### Bug Report

```markdown
## Summary

Fix crash when uploading files larger than 10MB.

## Context

### Background
Users report app crashes when uploading large attachments. Error reported by
3 users this week, all with files >10MB.

### Current State
Files >10MB cause uncaught exception in upload handler. Server returns 500,
client shows generic error. No file size validation exists.

### Desired State
Large files are rejected gracefully with clear error message before upload starts.
Server handles oversized uploads without crashing.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Add client-side file size check before upload
- [ ] Display error: "File too large. Maximum size is 10MB"
- [ ] Add server-side file size limit (defense in depth)
- [ ] Return 413 (Payload Too Large) for oversized requests
- [ ] Log oversized upload attempts with file size and user ID

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Multiple files where one exceeds limit: reject only that file
- [ ] Exactly 10MB: allow (limit is exclusive >10MB)
- [ ] Zero-byte files: allow (separate validation if needed)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Upload 15MB file: see error message, no crash
- [ ] Upload 10MB file: succeeds
- [ ] Upload 5MB file: succeeds
- [ ] Server logs show rejection reason
- [ ] No unhandled exceptions in error monitoring

## Implementation Notes

### Files to Modify
- `src/components/FileUpload.tsx:45` - Add size check before `handleUpload()`
- `src/api/upload.ts:23` - Add size validation middleware
- `src/config/limits.ts` - Add `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 10`

### Key Code Locations
- Upload handler: `src/api/upload.ts:23` - `uploadFile()`
- File input: `src/components/FileUpload.tsx:45` - `onChange` handler

### Error to Fix
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'buffer' of undefined
    at uploadFile (src/api/upload.ts:67)
    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:95:5)
```

## Technical Notes

- Current multer config has no size limit
- Nginx also needs limit: `client_max_body_size 10m;`
- Consider chunked upload for larger files (future ticket)
```

### Feature Request

```markdown
## Summary

Add dark mode toggle to user settings with system preference detection.

## Context

### Background
Dark mode requested by users (12 upvotes on feedback board). Improves
accessibility and reduces eye strain for night usage.

### Current State
App uses light theme only. No theme preference storage.

### Desired State
Users can choose: Light, Dark, or System (auto-detect). Preference persists
across sessions. Theme applies immediately without page reload.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Add theme toggle in Settings > Appearance
- [ ] Options: Light, Dark, System (follows OS preference)
- [ ] Store preference in user profile (database)
- [ ] Apply theme immediately on change (no reload)
- [ ] Respect system preference when "System" selected
- [ ] Default to "System" for new users

### Edge Cases
- [ ] User changes OS theme while app open: update if "System" selected
- [ ] Logged out users: store preference in localStorage
- [ ] Theme loads before page paint (no flash of wrong theme)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Toggle between themes in settings
- [ ] Preference persists after logout/login
- [ ] "System" follows OS dark mode setting
- [ ] No flash of unstyled/wrong theme on page load
- [ ] Works on all pages (verify: dashboard, settings, profile)

## Implementation Notes

### Files to Modify
- `src/styles/theme.ts` - Add dark theme colors
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` - Add theme state management
- `src/components/Settings/Appearance.tsx` - Add toggle UI
- `src/api/user.ts` - Add theme preference endpoint

### Files to Create
- `src/hooks/useTheme.ts` - Theme hook with system detection
- `src/styles/dark-theme.css` - Dark mode CSS variables

### Key Code Locations
- Current theme setup: `src/styles/theme.ts:1`
- Settings page: `src/pages/Settings.tsx:45`
- User profile API: `src/api/user.ts:78`

### Suggested Approach
1. Add CSS custom properties for theme colors
2. Create ThemeContext with Light/Dark/System state
3. Use `prefers-color-scheme` media query for system detection
4. Store in user.preferences.theme (string enum)

### Similar Patterns
- Notification preferences: `src/components/Settings/Notifications.tsx`
- User preference storage: `src/api/user.ts:updatePreferences()`

## Dependencies

- Related: #234 (accessibility improvements)
- Future: #567 (custom accent colors - builds on this)

## Out of Scope

- Custom color themes (future ticket)
- Per-page theme overrides (not needed)
- Theme scheduling (auto dark at night)
```

## Mermaid Diagrams for Visual Clarity

**Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex relationships, flows, and architectures.**

GitHub renders Mermaid diagrams natively in issue bodies and comments. Use them when:
- Showing data/control flow
- Illustrating state machines
- Depicting component relationships
- Mapping user journeys
- Visualizing before/after states

### When to Include Diagrams

| Scenario | Diagram Type |
|----------|--------------|
| API request flow | `flowchart` or `sequenceDiagram` |
| State changes | `stateDiagram-v2` |
| Component dependencies | `flowchart` with subgraphs |
| Data model relationships | `erDiagram` |
| Process workflow | `flowchart TD` |
| Timeline of events | `sequenceDiagram` |

### Diagram Examples

#### Flow Diagram

````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User clicks upload] --> B{File size check}
    B -->|> 10MB| C[Show error message]
    B -->|≤ 10MB| D[Upload to server]
    D --> E{Server validation}
    E -->|Valid| F[Store file]
    E -->|Invalid| G[Return 400]
```
````

#### Sequence Diagram

````markdown
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server
    participant D as Database

    U->>C: Click login
    C->>S: POST /auth/login
    S->>D: Verify credentials
    D-->>S: User found
    S-->>C: JWT token
    C-->>U: Redirect to dashboard
```
````

#### State Diagram

````markdown
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Uploading: file selected
    Uploading --> Processing: upload complete
    Uploading --> Error: upload failed
    Processing --> Complete: validation passed
    Processing --> Error: validation failed
    Error --> Idle: retry
    Complete --> [*]
```
````

### Integration with Ticket Template

Add diagrams in the **Context** or **Implementation Notes** sections:

```markdown
## Context

### Current Flow
[Mermaid diagram showing current broken flow]

### Desired Flow
[Mermaid diagram showing fixed flow]

## Implementation Notes

### Component Architecture
[Mermaid diagram showing how components interact]
```

**Tips:**
- Keep diagrams focused (5-10 nodes max)
- Use clear labels, not abbreviations
- Show before/after when fixing bugs
- Include diagrams in the ticket, not as external links

---

## Critical Principles

- **CAPTURE EVERYTHING NOW** - Context fades fast, write it all down
- **REQUIREMENTS AS CHECKBOXES** - Implementer needs clear checklist
- **CITE CODE LOCATIONS** - Don't make them search
- **INCLUDE ERRORS/LOGS** - Exact error messages save debugging time
- **DEFINE DONE** - Testable acceptance criteria
- **EXPLICIT SCOPE** - What's in AND what's out
- **ASSUME FRESH EYES** - Write for someone who knows nothing about this
- **VISUALIZE WITH MERMAID** - A diagram is worth 1000 words
