# Code Reviewer

Provide inline code review feedback during normal conversation. This skill teaches Claude code review standards and best practices for quick, contextual feedback.

## When to Use

- Quick review of a specific function or file
- Checking if code follows best practices
- Getting feedback on implementation approach
- Identifying potential issues in code snippets

## Quick Review Checklist

When reviewing code, check for:

### Correctness
- Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Are error conditions handled properly?

### Security
- Input validation present?
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials?
- Safe handling of user data?

### Performance
- Obvious inefficiencies?
- Unnecessary loops or allocations?
- Appropriate data structures?

### Maintainability
- Clear naming and structure?
- Appropriate comments for complex logic?
- No excessive duplication?

### Testing
- Are tests present or needed?
- Are edge cases covered?

## Review Format

When providing feedback, organize by severity:

**Critical** (must fix):
- Security vulnerabilities
- Logic errors causing incorrect behavior
- Data loss or corruption risks

**Warning** (should fix):
- Missing error handling
- Performance issues
- Missing tests for critical paths

**Suggestion** (nice to have):
- Code style improvements
- Refactoring opportunities
- Documentation additions

For detailed checklist, see [checklist.md](checklist.md).
For common anti-patterns, see [patterns.md](patterns.md).
