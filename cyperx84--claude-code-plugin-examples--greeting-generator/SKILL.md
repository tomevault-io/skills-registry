## Examples

### Morning Greeting (Energetic)

```
Good morning! Ready to write some beautiful code today?

Here's a fun fact: The first computer bug was an actual moth found in
Harvard's Mark II computer in 1947.

What are you building today? I'm here to help make it awesome!
```

### Afternoon Greeting (Professional)

```
Good afternoon! Hope your coding session is going well.

without creating a new commit.

What can I help you with today?
```

Good evening! Still coding strong, I see.

Remember: "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." - John Johnson

What challenge are you tackling tonight? Let's solve it together!
```

Programming joke: Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
Because light attracts bugs!

What late-night project are you working on? I'm here to help!
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Authentic**: Greetings should feel genuine, not robotic
