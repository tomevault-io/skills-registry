# Create Release

## When to Activate

- User runs `/release` command
- User asks to create a new release
- Changes are ready for versioning

## Steps

1. **Check UNRELEASED.md**: Verify there are changes to release
2. **Determine version**: Analyze changes for version bump
3. **Convert release notes**: UNRELEASED.md → vX.Y.Z.md
4. **Create new UNRELEASED.md**: Reset for next cycle
5. **Commit**: Stage and commit release notes
6. **Create tag**: git tag vX.Y.Z
7. **Push**: Push commit and tag to origin

## Execution

### Step 1: Check UNRELEASED.md

Read `docs/releasenotes/UNRELEASED.md` and verify it has content beyond the template.

If empty (only template placeholders), abort with message: "No changes to release."

### Step 2: Determine Version

Check existing tags:
```bash
git tag -l 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | head -5
```

Analyze UNRELEASED.md content:
- Breaking Changes section has content → MAJOR bump
- Added section has content → MINOR bump
- Only Fixed/Changed → PATCH bump

Ask user to confirm version number.

### Step 3: Convert Release Notes

1. Read UNRELEASED.md content
2. Create `docs/releasenotes/vX.Y.Z.md` with:
   - Version header
   - Release date (today)
   - Content from UNRELEASED.md

### Step 4: Reset UNRELEASED.md

Reset to empty template with sections:
- Header: `# Unreleased` with quote `> Changes pending for the next release`
- Sections: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security, Breaking Changes
- Footer: `*Auto-updated by reviewer agent on PR creation.*`

### Step 5-7: Commit, Tag, Push

```bash
git add docs/releasenotes/
git commit -m "chore: release vX.Y.Z

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin main --tags
```

## Notes

- Always confirm version with user before creating tag
- Tags trigger GitHub Actions (if configured)
- After release, UNRELEASED.md is ready for next cycle
