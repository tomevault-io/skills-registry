# Linear CLI

A cross-platform CLI for Linear's GraphQL API, with unblocked issue filtering.

Install: `npm install -g @dabble/linear-cli`

## First-Time Setup

```bash
linear login
```

This will:

1. Ask where to save credentials (project or global)
2. Open Linear API settings in your browser
3. Prompt you to paste your API key
4. Show available teams and let you pick one (or create a new team)
5. Save config to the chosen location

## Configuration

Config is layered: `~/.linear` (global) is loaded first, then `./.linear` (local) overrides on top. Local values override global; unset local values inherit from global. Env vars (`LINEAR_API_KEY`, `LINEAR_TEAM`, `LINEAR_PROJECT`, `LINEAR_MILESTONE`) are used as fallbacks.

```
# .linear file format
api_key=lin_api_xxx
team=ISSUE
project=My Project
milestone=Sprint 3

[aliases]
V2=Version 2.0 Release
MVP=MVP Milestone
```

## Aliases

Create short codes for projects and milestones to use in commands:

```bash
# Create aliases
linear alias V2 "Version 2.0"           # For a project
linear alias MVP "MVP Milestone"        # For a milestone

# List all aliases
linear alias --list

# Remove an alias
linear alias --remove MVP
```

Use aliases anywhere a project or milestone name is accepted:

```bash
linear issues --project V2
linear issues --milestone MVP
linear issue create --project V2 --milestone MVP "New feature"
linear milestones --project V2
```

Aliases are shown in `linear projects` and `linear milestones` output:

```
Projects:
[V2] Version 2.0 Release  started  58%

Milestones:
[MVP] MVP Milestone [next]
```

linear done --keep-branch        # Don't suggest deleting the branch
```

## Estimation

Use t-shirt sizes for estimates. Always use `--estimate` (not `-e`) for clarity.

| Size | Meaning                                   |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- |
| XS   | Trivial, < 1 hour                         |
| S    | Small, couple hours                       |
| M    | Medium, a day or so                       |
| L    | Large, multi-day - consider breaking down |
| XL   | Very large - should definitely break down |

```bash
# Create with estimate (use long flags for clarity)
linear issue create --title "Add caching" --estimate M --assign

# L/XL issues should be broken into sub-issues
linear issue create --title "Implement auth" --estimate L
linear issue create --title "Add login endpoint" --parent ISSUE-5 --estimate S
linear issue create --title "Add JWT validation" --parent ISSUE-5 --estimate S
```

## Git Conventions

Always link git work to Linear issues:

```bash
# Create branch from issue (recommended)
linear branch ISSUE-5            # Creates: ISSUE-5-add-caching-layer

# Commit message format
git commit -m "ISSUE-5: Add cache invalidation on logout"

# Include issue ID in PR title
gh pr create --title "ISSUE-5: Add caching layer"
```

## Workflow Guidelines

### Setting context

When working on a specific project/milestone, set it as default to avoid repeating flags:

```bash
linear project open "Phase 1"    # All commands now default to Phase 1
linear milestone open "Sprint 3" # And to Sprint 3 milestone
linear issues                    # Shows Phase 1 > Sprint 3 issues only
linear issue create --title "Fix" # Created in Phase 1, Sprint 3
linear project close             # Done? Clear the context
```

### Getting oriented

```bash
linear roadmap                  # See all projects, milestones, progress
linear issues --project "P1"    # Issues in a specific project
linear issues --milestone "M1"  # Issues in a specific milestone
```

### Issue ordering

Issue lists are returned in sort order by default. The first issue in the list is the highest priority to address next. Use this ordering to decide what to work on, and maintain it when creating issues:

```bash
# Position new issues relative to existing ones
linear issue create --title "Urgent fix" --before ISSUE-3   # Insert higher in the list
linear issue create --title "Nice to have" --after ISSUE-5   # Insert lower in the list

# Reorder existing issues
linear issue move ISSUE-5 --before ISSUE-1
linear issues reorder ISSUE-1 ISSUE-2 ISSUE-3
```

When creating multiple related issues, use `--before`/`--after` to place them in the order they should be addressed.

### Starting work on an issue

```bash
linear issues --unblocked       # Find what's ready
linear issue show ISSUE-2        # Review it (shows parent context)
linear issue start ISSUE-2       # Assign + set In Progress
linear branch ISSUE-2            # Create git branch
```

### When you hit a blocker

If work cannot continue due to a dependency or external factor:

```bash
# Create the blocking issue
linear issue create --title "Need API credentials" --blocks ISSUE-5

# Or mark existing issue as blocking
linear issue update ISSUE-3 --blocks ISSUE-5
```

This removes ISSUE-5 from `--unblocked` results until the blocker is resolved.

### When a task is larger than expected

If you discover an M issue is actually L/XL, break it down:

```bash
# Create sub-issues
linear issue create --title "Step 1: Research approach" --parent ISSUE-5 --estimate S
linear issue create --title "Step 2: Implement core logic" --parent ISSUE-5 --estimate M
linear issue create --title "Step 3: Add tests" --parent ISSUE-5 --estimate S

# Start working on the first sub-issue
linear issue start ISSUE-6
```

### Checklists vs. sub-issues

Use description checklists for lightweight steps within a single issue. Use sub-issues when items need their own status, assignee, or estimate.

```bash
# Checklist — quick implementation steps, a punch list, acceptance criteria
linear issue update ISSUE-5 --append "## TODO\n- [ ] Add validation\n- [ ] Update tests\n- [ ] Check edge cases"

# Check off completed items (fuzzy matches the item text)
linear issue update ISSUE-5 --check "validation"
linear issue update ISSUE-5 --check "tests"

# Uncheck if needed
linear issue update ISSUE-5 --uncheck "validation"

# Sub-issues — substantial, independently trackable work
linear issue create --title "Add login endpoint" --parent ISSUE-5 --estimate S
```

Prefer checklists when the items are small and don't need independent tracking. Prefer sub-issues when you'd want to assign, estimate, or block on them individually. Use `--check` to mark items complete as you finish them.

### Completing work

After finishing implementation, ask the developer if they want to close the issue:

```bash
# Suggest closing
linear issue close ISSUE-5
```

Do not auto-close issues. Let the developer review the work first.

### Adding notes while working

```bash
linear issue update ISSUE-2 --append "## Notes\n\nDiscovered X, trying Y approach..."
# or for quick updates
linear issue comment ISSUE-2 "Found the root cause in auth.ts:142"
```

### Attaching documents to issues

Use `issue attach -d` to create a Linear document and attach it to an issue. This is useful for storing detailed plans, specs, or research without filling up the issue description. The document content is read from stdin.

```bash
# Pipe content directly
echo "# Implementation Plan\n\n## Approach\n..." | linear issue attach ISSUE-5 -d "Implementation Plan"

# From a file
linear issue attach ISSUE-5 -d "Technical Spec" < spec.md
```

Documents appear under **Resources** in `linear issue show`, alongside URL attachments. Prefer documents over long descriptions when the content is supplementary (plans, research, specs) rather than the core issue definition.

To remove attachments, use `issue detach` or `update --unlink`. Match by URL or title. Add `--delete` to also delete the underlying Linear document (not just the attachment link).

```bash
linear issue detach ISSUE-5 "Implementation Plan"            # Remove attachment by title
linear issue detach ISSUE-5 "Implementation Plan" --delete   # Remove and delete the document
linear issue detach ISSUE-5 https://example.com/spec         # Remove by URL
```

### Organizing with milestones

Milestones group related issues within a project:

```bash
# Create milestone for a release
linear milestone create "Beta" --project "Phase 1" --target-date 2024-03-01

# Add issues to milestone
linear issue create --title "Core feature" --milestone "Beta" --estimate M
linear issue update ISSUE-5 --milestone "Beta"

# Reorder milestones to reflect priority
linear milestones reorder "Alpha" "Beta" "Stable" --project "Phase 1"
```

### Completing a phase

```bash
linear issue close ISSUE-7       # Close remaining issues
linear project complete "Phase 1"
# Then update CLAUDE.md status table
```

## Parent Context

When viewing an issue with `linear issue show`, you'll see where it fits in the larger work, along with linked resources:

```
# ISSUE-6: Add JWT validation

State: In Progress
...

## Context

ISSUE-3: Implement authentication system
  - [Done] ISSUE-4: Add login endpoint
  → [In Progress] ISSUE-6: Add JWT validation  ← you are here
  - [Backlog] ISSUE-7: Add refresh tokens

## Resources

  - Implementation Plan
    https://linear.app/team/document/implementation-plan-abc123
  - github.com/org/repo/pull/42
    https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42
```

This helps understand the scope, what comes before/after the current task, and any linked PRs or documentation.
