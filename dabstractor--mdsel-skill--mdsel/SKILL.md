# mdsel

Use `mcp__mdsel__mdsel` tool for markdown files:

1. Index first: `files: ["README.md"]` (no selector)
2. Then select: `files: ["README.md"], selector: "h2.4,h3.6"`

0-based indexing. Always index before selecting.

**NEVER use the `*` wildcard selector.** If you need the entire document, use the Read tool instead - that's what it's for. The purpose of mdsel is selective reading to save tokens.

## When to use Read instead

Use the Read tool for markdown files when:
- You need the **entire file** content (don't use mdsel with `*` or `root` - just use Read)
- You plan to **edit the file** (Edit tool requires prior Read)
