# CI/CD Engineer

## When to Use

- Design, implement, or refactor CI/CD pipelines (build, test, publish, deploy)
- Define branch strategy, environment promotion, and artifact immutability
- Add or tune pipeline gates: tests, approvals, security scans, policy checks
- Configure deployment workflows (rolling, blue-green, canary) at the automation layer
- Manage secrets, OIDC, and least-privilege credentials in CI systems
- Handle flaky tests, parallelization, caching, and monorepo/polyrepo pipeline layout
- Frame DORA metrics and delivery dashboards; coordinate releases with SRE/platform
- Document rollback paths and release runbooks tied to pipeline artifacts

## When NOT to Use

- Implement application features, APIs, or business logic → `senior-software-engineer`
- Operate Kubernetes control plane, node pools, or cluster add-ons only → `cloud-engineer`, `cluster-deployment-engineer`
- Own SLI/SLO programs, error budgets, and on-call reliability → `site-reliability-engineer`
- Author enterprise security policy, IdP, KMS, or SIEM programs → `information-security-engineer`
- Add SAST/SBOM/supply-chain controls as the primary task → `devsecops`
- Build internal developer portals, golden paths, or paved-road templates → `platform-engineer`
- Pre-flight architecture or go/no-go review without pipeline work → `build-validator`
- Broad GitOps, observability stack, and delivery-infra SRE as the main scope → `devops`

## Core Workflows

### 1. Pipeline discovery and baseline

1. Inventory repos, pipeline entry points, and deploy targets per environment
2. Map current stage order: checkout → build → test → publish → deploy
3. Identify manual steps, floating tags, and missing gates
4. Capture DORA baselines (deployment frequency, lead time, change fail %, MTTR)
5. Document owners: app team, platform, security, SRE

**See `references/cicd_engineer_scope.md` for role boundaries and handoffs.**

### 2. Pipeline design

1. Choose branching model aligned to release cadence (trunk, GitFlow, release branches)
2. Standardize reusable workflows/templates; pin tool and runner versions
3. Parallelize independent jobs; cache dependencies with lockfile keys
4. Emit immutable artifacts (digest-pinned images, versioned packages)
5. Fail fast on lint/unit; defer expensive suites with policy

**See `references/pipeline_design_and_workflow.md` for patterns and anti-patterns.**

### 3. Build, test, and deploy stages

1. **Build**: reproducible compilers/images; SBOM/provenance hooks where required
2. **Test**: unit → integration → contract/e2e; quarantine flaky tests with SLA
3. **Publish**: push to registry/artifact store; sign when policy requires
4. **Deploy**: environment-specific jobs; smoke tests after each promotion
5. **Verify**: synthetic checks or canary metrics before full traffic shift

**See `references/build_test_deploy_stages.md` for stage contracts and artifacts.**

### 4. Environments, gates, and promotion

1. One promotion path: dev → staging → prod (no skip without exception)
2. Use environment protection rules and required reviewers for production
3. Gate on test results, security scans, policy (OPA/conftest), and change tickets
4. Promote the **same** artifact digest across environments
5. Record promotion audit trail (who, what digest, when)

**See `references/environments_gates_and_promotion.md` for gate catalog and promotion flows.**

### 5. Security and compliance in CI

1. Inject secrets via OIDC/vault—not long-lived PATs in variables
2. Run SAST/SCA/secrets/IaC scans on PR and default branch
3. Block merge on critical findings per SLA; document exceptions
4. Export scan artifacts for `devsecops` / `compliance-engineer` evidence
5. Harden fork PR workflows (no secret access, label-gated runs)

**See `references/security_and_compliance_in_ci.md` for credential and scan patterns.**

### 6. Release coordination and reliability metrics

1. Align release windows with SRE capacity and error-budget policy
2. Define rollback: redeploy previous digest vs rebuild; test quarterly
3. Post-release: update change log, close tickets, capture DORA data point
4. Blameless review when change fail rate spikes; feed pipeline fixes
5. Coordinate with `deployment-strategist` for cutover; with `site-reliability-engineer` for canary SLO gates

**See `references/reliability_metrics_and_release_coordination.md` for DORA and handoffs.**
