# SDK Engineer

## When to Use

- Design or implement **client SDKs** and API client libraries for public or partner APIs
- Align SDK surface area with **OpenAPI**, GraphQL schema, protobuf, or RPC contracts
- Model resources, operations, pagination, streaming, and error types in client code
- Implement **authentication** flows (API keys, OAuth2, HMAC/signing, mTLS hooks)
- Define **retries, timeouts, idempotency keys**, and resilience defaults for SDK users
- Plan **versioning, deprecation**, and multi-language SDK parity (naming, packaging, semver)
- Author **quickstarts, examples**, and SDK docs that match the API reference
- Build **contract tests** and integration tests against sandboxes or recorded fixtures

## When NOT to Use

- Design the **backend API or service** only without a client library → `api-development`, `senior-software-engineer`, `enterprise-integration-api-developer`
- Build **end-user application UI** or product frontends → `senior-frontend-software-engineer`, `fullstack-software-engineer`
- Stand up **internal developer platforms**, golden paths, or portals without SDK product work → `platform-engineer`
- Write **documentation or tutorials** without implementing or evolving an SDK → `tech-writer-researcher`
- Run **pre-flight architecture or build go/no-go** reviews without SDK delivery → `build-validator`

## Core Workflows

### 1. Scope and contract intake

1. Identify API style (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, JSON-RPC) and **source of truth** (OpenAPI, proto, schema registry)
2. List target languages/runtimes and distribution (npm, PyPI, Maven, Go module, crates.io)
3. Define non-goals (server implementation, CLI-only wrappers, codegen-only with no hand layer)
4. Capture breaking-change policy and minimum supported API version

**See `references/sdk_engineer_scope.md`.**

### 2. Client modeling and public surface

Map contract operations to **idiomatic client types**: resources, services, request builders, and enums.

1. Prefer stable resource-oriented names over raw URL paths in public API
2. Hide transport details; expose optional raw request escape hatches for power users
3. Keep configuration (base URL, credentials, timeouts) on a single client instance
4. Document thread-safety / async model per language

**See `references/api_contracts_and_client_modeling.md`.**

### 3. Auth, resilience, and errors

1. Implement credential providers and token refresh without surprising global state
2. Apply default timeouts; retry only **idempotent** operations with bounded backoff + jitter
3. Map HTTP/gRPC status and error bodies to a **typed error hierarchy** with request IDs
4. Support idempotency keys where the API documents them

**See `references/auth_retries_and_resilience.md`.**

### 4. Pagination, streaming, and large payloads

1. Implement cursor/page iterators that compose cleanly (`for await`, generators, paginators)
2. Support streaming RPC or SSE where the contract requires partial results
3. Avoid buffering unbounded collections; document memory trade-offs

**See `references/pagination_streaming_and_resources.md`.**

### 5. Versioning and compatibility

1. Ship SDK semver independent of API version where possible; document mapping
2. Add deprecation warnings, sunset dates, and migration snippets in release notes
3. Run compatibility suites against N API versions when feasible

**See `references/versioning_and_compatibility.md`.**

### 6. Testing and documentation

1. **Contract tests**: generated or hand-written against OpenAPI/proto examples
2. **Integration tests**: sandbox credentials, VCR/fixtures, or ephemeral environments
3. Align README, quickstart, and reference docs with the official API catalog
4. Publish runnable examples in CI

**See `references/sdk_testing_and_documentation.md`.**
