# Change Plan & Conventional Commits

Create a structured plan for code changes and draft compliant commit messages.

## Workflow

1.  **Analyze the Request**
    Identify the scope: is it a feature, fix, refactor, or chore?
    - **feat**: New functionality.
    - **fix**: Bug fix.
    - **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
    - **docs**: Documentation only.
    - **test**: Adding or correcting tests.
    - **chore**: Build process, auxiliary tools.

2.  **Draft the Plan**
    Break down the task into logical steps. Each step should be verifiable.
    - _Step 1: Create X component._
    - _Step 2: Add tests for X._
    - _Step 3: Integrate X into Y._

3.  **Identify Risks & Validations**
    - What could break?
    - Which tests should run? (e.g., `npm run test:unit`, `npm run lint`)

4.  **Draft Commit Messages**
    Propose commit messages for the changes. Use the format:
    `type(scope): description`
    - `feat(audio): add new synth engine`
    - `fix(ui): resolve button overlapping issue`

## Detailed Guidelines

- **Scope**: Optional but recommended (e.g., `ui`, `audio`, `api`).
- **Description**: Imperative, lowercase, no period at end (e.g., "add feature" not "Added feature.").
- **Body**: Optional. Explain _what_ and _why_, not _how_.

## Example

**Input**: "I need to fix the volume slider not persisting after reload."

**Output Plan**:

1.  **Analyze**: The `VolumeSlider` component updates state but doesn't write to `localStorage`.
2.  **Plan**:
    - Modify `useAudioSettings` to read/write `localStorage`.
    - Update `VolumeSlider` to use the initial value from the hook.
    - Verify by reloading the page.
3.  **Commit**:

    ```
    fix(audio): persist volume settings to localStorage

    The volume slider now saves its value to localStorage and restores it on page load.
    ```
