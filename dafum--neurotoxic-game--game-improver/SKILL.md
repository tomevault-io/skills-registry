# Game Improver

Implement production-ready improvements—bug fixes, features, optimizations, and refactoring—for NEUROTOXIC.

## Quick Routing Decision Tree

**Is the issue primarily...?**

| Issue Type                                               | Use This Skill | Else Use                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gameplay balance** (costs, rewards, difficulty)        | ❌             | `game-balancing-assistant`                                      |
| **Audio playback** (music fails, stutters, wrong track)  | ❌             | `audio-debugger-ambient-vs-gig` or `webaudio-reliability-fixer` |
| **UI design** (colors, borders, layout, typography)      | ❌             | `convention-keeper-brutalist-ui`                                |
| **State bugs** (reducer errors, invalid transitions)     | ✅             | `state-safety-action-creator-guard`                             |
| **Core logic bug** (game loop, travel cost calc)         | ✅             | —                                                               |
| **New feature** (upgrade, item, system)                  | ✅             | —                                                               |
| **Performance** (render loops, memory, bundle)           | ✅             | —                                                               |
| **Testing** (regression, integration, edge cases)        | ✅             | —                                                               |
| **Refactoring** (extract components, reduce duplication) | ✅             | —                                                               |

**Unsure?** Proceed here. If we need a specialist, we'll delegate mid-workflow.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Understand the Request

- What problem are we solving? (user pain, crash, balance, performance)
- What's the affected game system? (economy, progression, audio, UI, state)
- What's the success metric? (no crashes, +X DPS, faster load time, clarity)

### 2. Research & Map Dependencies

- **State**: Which reducers, actions, selectors are involved?
- **UI**: Which components render the feature? Do they need updates?
- **Data**: Which data files (upgrades.js, hqItems.js, events) are affected?
- **Audio**: Does this touch AudioContext or Tone.js?
- **Pixi**: Any scene rendering, animations, or dynamic assets?
- **Localization**: User-facing text? Add i18n keys.
- **Tests**: What should pass/fail after this change?

Use **references/improvement-patterns.md** to find a similar change.

### 3. Plan Implementation

Define:

- **Files to modify**: List top 3-5 files.
- **Changes**: Brief 1–2 sentence summary per file.
- **State mutations**: Any new `ActionTypes` or reducer cases?
- **Tests to add/update**: Which tests validate the fix?
- **Localization**: New i18n keys needed?

### 4. Implement

**State changes**: Use `ActionTypes`, reducers, action creators (together, not separately).
**UI changes**: Follow Tailwind v4 syntax (`@import "tailwindcss"`, color tokens with `--color-` prefix).
**Localization**: All user text via `t('key')`. Namespaced keys (`ui:`, `events:`, etc.). Both `en` and `de`.
**Performance**: Memoize expensive calcs, watch for per-frame allocations, destroy Pixi on unmount.
**Pixi cleanup**: Always use `app.destroy({ removeView: true }, { children: true, texture: true, textureSource: true })`.

See **references/state-mutations.md**, **references/improvement-patterns.md**, **references/performance-guardrails.md**.

### 5. Verify & Test

**Run full test suite** (takes ~3-5 min):

```bash
pnpm run test:all  # lint + test + test:ui in sequence
```

**Run targeted tests** (faster, for iteration):

```bash
# Logic tests
pnpm run test -- tests/path/to/file.test.js

# UI tests
pnpm run test:ui -- tests/path/to/file.test.jsx

# Watch mode (re-run on save)
pnpm run test -- --watch
```

**Build check** (catches import errors, bundle issues):

```bash
pnpm run build
```

**All verification in one command**:

```bash
pnpm run lint && pnpm run test && pnpm run test:ui && pnpm run build
```

See **references/verification-checklist.md** for detailed criteria.

## Core Constraints

**Stack**: React 19.2.4, Vite 8.0.1, Tailwind 4.2.2, Framer Motion 12.38.0, Tone.js 15.5.6. Node 22.13+.
**State Limits**: `player.money >= 0`, `band.harmony ∈ [1, 100]`, `van.fuel ∈ [0, 100]`. Clamp via `gameStateUtils.js`.
**Audio**: Use `audioEngine.getGigTimeMs()` as single clock. Don't access Tone.js directly. Handle suspended AudioContext.
**Pixi**: Destroy on unmount. No memory leaks. Pre-compute, don't allocate per-frame.
**I18n**: ALL user text via `t('key')`. Namespaced (`ui:`, `events:`, etc.). Both `en` and `de`.
**Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.).

## Examples

### Example 1: Bug Fix (State Corruption)

**Input**: "Fix: traveling doesn't deduct fuel correctly"

**Workflow**:

1. Find travel logic: `src/hooks/useOverworldLogic.js` (or `economyEngine.js`)
2. Check reducer: Does `UPDATE_PLAYER` subtract fuel? Check `gameReducer.js`
3. Find test: `tests/travel.test.js` — what's the failing assertion?
4. Fix: Add fuel deduction to travel action payload
5. Test: `pnpm run test -- tests/travel.test.js`
6. Verify bounds: Is fuel clamped to [0, 100]? Check `gameStateUtils.js`

### Example 2: New Feature (Upgrade System)

**Input**: "Add meditation pod upgrade: +1 harmony/day, costs 500"

**Workflow**:

1. Data: Edit `src/data/hqItems.js` — add item with `effect: 'harmony_regen'`
2. Economy: Check `economyEngine.js` — does it handle `harmony_regen` effect?
3. Hook: `useGameLoop.js` — apply effect each day via `ADVANCE_DAY`
4. Tests: Add to `tests/economyEngine.test.js` — verify cost, effect, clamping
5. Localization: Add keys to `public/locales/en.json` and `public/locales/de.json`

### Example 3: Performance (Memory Leak)

**Input**: "Fix: memory grows when switching gigs"

**Workflow**:

1. Suspect: Pixi scene, audio context, event listeners not cleaned up
2. Find scene: `src/scenes/GigScene.jsx` or `src/components/PixiStageController.jsx`
3. Check cleanup: Does `useEffect` clean up? Pixi destroyed on unmount?
4. Fix: Add `app.destroy({...})` in cleanup function
5. Test: Monitor memory in DevTools; watch for growing heap

See **references/improvement-patterns.md** for more complete examples.
