# Skill QA Harness

Ensure all skills in the library are valid and functional.

## Workflow

1.  **Discovery**
    Scan `.claude/skills/` for all `SKILL.md` files.
    - Validate skills inventory before deeper checks.

2.  **Structural Validation**
    For each skill:
    - **Frontmatter**: Does it have `name` and `description`?
    - **Format**: Is it valid YAML?
    - **Paths**: Do referenced scripts exist?

3.  **Logical Validation**
    - **Duplicates**: Are there multiple skills with the same name?
    - **Conflicts**: Do descriptions overlap significantly?

4.  **Reporting**
    Generate a PASS/FAIL report.
    - Run tests after structural validation to confirm behavior.

## Quick Actions

- **Validate skills** with the validator command.
- **Run tests** for prompt cases and regression checks.

## Commands

Use the bundled validator (if available in `skilltest`):

```bash
node .claude/skills/skilltest/scripts/validate-skills.mjs
```

## Example

**Input**: "I added a new skill. Check if it's valid."

**Action**:
Run validation script.

**Output**:

```text
[FAIL] new-skill/SKILL.md: Missing 'description' in frontmatter.
[PASS] old-skill/SKILL.md
```

"The new skill is missing a description. Please add it to the YAML header."

_Skill sync: compatible with React 19.2.4 / Vite 7.3.1 baseline as of 2026-02-17._
