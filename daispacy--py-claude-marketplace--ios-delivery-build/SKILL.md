You are managing iOS delivery builds to QC testing with GitLab integration.

## Step 1: Get Current Branch

Execute immediately:
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

Store result as `{current_branch}`.

## Step 2: Mode Selection

Ask user to select delivery mode:
- **develop**: Create develop task and move original to testing
- **delivery**: Close issues after delivery
- **bugfix**: Move issues to testing status
- **redelivery**: Create pipeline only, no issue management

Use AskUserQuestion with these exact options:
- "develop - Create develop task and move original to testing"
- "delivery - Close issues after delivery"
- "bugfix - Move issues to testing status"
- "redelivery - Create pipeline only"

If invalid mode after 3 attempts, abort with error.

## Step 3: Collect Form Inputs

Present form template from `templates.md` based on selected mode.

**Required for ALL modes:**
- branch (pre-filled with {current_branch})
- scheme (default: "Payoo Merchant Sandbox")
- recipient (from predefined list in templates.md)
- description
- reply_on_thread (default: "none")
- project (default: "rnd/ios/payoo-ios-app-merchant")

**Conditional fields:**
- issue_numbers: Required for develop/delivery/bugfix, NOT for redelivery
- estimates: Required for develop/delivery, NOT for bugfix/redelivery

Parse user input and extract all field values.

## Step 4: Validate Inputs

Before proceeding, validate:
- branch exists (check with `git branch --list`)
- issue_numbers are numeric (skip for redelivery)
- recipient matches format "Name|ID" from predefined list
- estimates count matches issue_numbers count (for delivery/develop only)
- reply_on_thread is "none" or valid URL
- scheme and project are non-empty

If validation fails, show specific errors and request corrections.

## Step 5: Create GitLab Pipeline

Use MCP tool `mobile-mcp-server/gitlab-create-pipeline-for-branch`:
```
scheme: {scheme}
branchName: {branch}
recipient: {recipient}
replyOnThread: {reply_on_thread}
description: {description}
project: {project}
```

If pipeline creation fails, abort workflow with error.

## Step 6: Plan Issue Management Actions

Based on mode, plan actions (see `examples.md` for detailed workflows):

**bugfix mode:**
- For each issue in issue_numbers, plan to add label "status::totesting"

**delivery mode:**
- For each issue, plan to close with corresponding estimate

**develop mode:**
- Get first issue details
- Create develop task with "[Develop]" suffix
- Move original issue to testing
- Close develop task with estimate

**redelivery mode:**
- No issue actions needed, skip to completion

## Step 7: Confirmation and Execution

**For redelivery mode:**
- Display: "Pipeline created successfully. No issue management for redelivery."
- End workflow

**For other modes:**
- Display all planned actions in readable format
- Ask: "Do you want to proceed? (yes/no)"
- If "yes": Execute all actions sequentially, show progress
- If "no": Abort with message about pipeline being created but issues not managed

## Error Handling

- Invalid issue IID: Skip and log warning, continue with others
- API timeout: Retry once after 5 seconds, then fail
- Authentication error: Abort immediately
- Invalid branch: Abort before creating pipeline

Always provide:
- What failed
- Why it failed (if known)
- What completed successfully
- Suggested next steps

## Output Format

Show clear summary:
```
✅ Pipeline Created
Branch: {branch}
Scheme: {scheme}
Recipient: {recipient}
Description: {description}

📋 Issue Management:
[List of planned/executed actions]

✅ Workflow Complete
```
