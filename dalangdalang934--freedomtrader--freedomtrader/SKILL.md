# Development Documentation

Every coding session MUST maintain `DEVLOG.md` at the project root. This is non-negotiable.

## When to Update

- **Session start** — Read existing DEVLOG.md, understand recent context
- **Session end** — Append session summary before committing
- **After each meaningful change** — Feature, bugfix, refactor, config change

## Workflow

### 1. Session Start

Read `DEVLOG.md` (create if missing). Review the last 2-3 entries for context.

### 2. During Development

Track what you're doing mentally. Note:
- Files changed and why
- Key decisions made
- Problems encountered and how they were solved
- Any tech debt introduced or resolved

### 3. Session End (MANDATORY before commit)

Append a new entry to `DEVLOG.md` using this format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — Brief Title

**Scope:** feature | bugfix | refactor | config | docs

**Changes:**
- Concise description of what changed and why
- Another change...

**Files touched:**
- `path/to/file.js` — what was modified
- `path/to/other.js` — what was modified

**Decisions & rationale:**
- Decision made → why this approach was chosen

**Known issues / tech debt:**
- Any remaining issues or shortcuts taken

**Next steps:**
- What should be done next
```

## Rules

1. **One entry per session** — Don't overwrite previous entries, always append
2. **Be specific** — "Fixed trading bug" is bad; "Fixed SOL sell tx failing when token has transfer fee due to missing fee account in instruction" is good
3. **Include file paths** — Future you needs to know WHERE things changed
4. **Document WHY** — Code shows WHAT changed; the log explains WHY
5. **Keep entries compact** — Each entry should be 10-30 lines, not a novel
6. **Record decisions** — If you chose approach A over B, say why
7. **Flag tech debt** — If you took a shortcut, note it for future cleanup

## Creating DEVLOG.md (first time only)

If `DEVLOG.md` doesn't exist, create it with:

```markdown
# Development Log

Chronological record of development sessions, decisions, and changes.

---
```

Then append the first entry.

## Format Reference

See [templates.md](templates.md) for entry templates for different change types.
