# Skill: homebrew

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- Install software, a tool, an app, or a package on macOS
- Install a programming language, database, or dev tool (e.g. node, python, redis, postgres, go, rust)
- Install a GUI/desktop application via `brew install --cask` (e.g. Chrome, Slack, Docker, VS Code)
- Search for available packages or check if something is installable via Homebrew
- List installed packages or check what's currently on the system
- Update Homebrew or upgrade installed packages
- Uninstall / remove a package
- Diagnose or fix Homebrew issues (`brew doctor`)
- Tap a new Homebrew repository
- Check info or version of an installed package

## Prerequisites

- **macOS only** — Homebrew is a macOS package manager (also works on Linux but this skill targets Mac)
- Homebrew must be installed. If not, install it first:
  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```

## Available Tool

The `brew` tool is registered as a core tool. Use it directly:

| Action         | Tool Input                                                  | Description                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `install`      | `{"action": "install", "packages": ["node", "redis"]}`      | Install one or more formulae         |
| `install_cask` | `{"action": "install_cask", "packages": ["google-chrome"]}` | Install GUI apps via cask            |
| `uninstall`    | `{"action": "uninstall", "packages": ["node"]}`             | Remove installed packages            |
| `search`       | `{"action": "search", "query": "python"}`                   | Search for available packages        |
| `info`         | `{"action": "info", "packages": ["node"]}`                  | Get detailed info about a package    |
| `list`         | `{"action": "list"}`                                        | List all installed formulae          |
| `list_casks`   | `{"action": "list_casks"}`                                  | List all installed cask apps         |
| `update`       | `{"action": "update"}`                                      | Update Homebrew itself               |
| `upgrade`      | `{"action": "upgrade"}`                                     | Upgrade all outdated packages        |
| `upgrade`      | `{"action": "upgrade", "packages": ["node"]}`               | Upgrade specific packages            |
| `doctor`       | `{"action": "doctor"}`                                      | Diagnose Homebrew issues             |
| `tap`          | `{"action": "tap", "tap_name": "homebrew/cask-fonts"}`      | Add a third-party repo               |
| `outdated`     | `{"action": "outdated"}`                                    | Show packages with updates available |

## Procedure

1. **Check Homebrew is available**: The `brew` tool will automatically verify Homebrew is installed before running any action. If not found, it will return instructions to install it.
2. **Determine what to install**: Extract the package name(s) from the user's request. If unclear, use `ask_user` to clarify.
3. **Choose formulae vs cask**: CLI tools use `install`, GUI apps (Chrome, Slack, Docker Desktop, etc.) use `install_cask`.
4. **Execute**: Call the `brew` tool with the appropriate action and parameters.
5. **Report results**: Confirm what was installed/updated/removed with version info where available.
