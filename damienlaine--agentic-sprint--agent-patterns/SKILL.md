# Agent Patterns

Sprint coordinates multiple specialized agents through structured communication patterns. This skill covers the SPAWN REQUEST format, report structure, parallel execution, and inter-agent coordination.

## Agent Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Sprint Orchestrator         │
│    (parses requests, spawns agents) │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │
                  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Project Architect            │
│  (plans, creates specs, coordinates)│
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │ SPAWN REQUEST
                  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│      Implementation & Test Agents   │
│   (execute, report, never spawn)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key rule**: Only the orchestrator spawns agents. Agents communicate by returning structured messages.

## SPAWN REQUEST Format

The architect requests agent spawning using a specific format:

```markdown
## SPAWN REQUEST

- python-dev
- nextjs-dev
- cicd-agent
```

### Parsing Rules

The orchestrator parses SPAWN REQUEST blocks:
- Section must start with `## SPAWN REQUEST` on its own line
- Each agent listed as a bullet point
- Multiple agents spawn in parallel

### Implementation Agents

Request during Phase 2:
```markdown
## SPAWN REQUEST

- python-dev
- nextjs-dev
```

Never include test agents in implementation requests.

### Testing Agents

Request during Phase 3:
```markdown
## SPAWN REQUEST

- qa-test-agent
- ui-test-agent
```

The ui-test-agent runs in AUTOMATED or MANUAL mode based on `specs.md`:
- `UI Testing Mode: automated` (default) → runs test scenarios automatically
- `UI Testing Mode: manual` → opens browser for user to test, waits for tab close

## Agent Report Format

All agents return structured reports. The orchestrator saves these as files.

### Standard Report Sections

Every report includes:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| CONFORMITY STATUS | YES/NO - did agent follow specs? |
| SUMMARY | Brief outcome description |
| DEVIATIONS | Justified departures from specs |
| FILES CHANGED | List of modified files |
| ISSUES | Problems encountered |
| NOTES FOR ARCHITECT | Suggestions, observations |

### Example: Backend Report

```markdown
## BACKEND REPORT

### CONFORMITY STATUS: YES

### SUMMARY
Implemented user authentication endpoints per api-contract.md.

### FILES CHANGED
- backend/app/routers/auth.py (new)
- backend/app/models/user.py (modified)
- backend/app/schemas/auth.py (new)
- backend/alembic/versions/001_add_users.py (new)

### DEVIATIONS
None.

### ISSUES
None.

### NOTES FOR ARCHITECT
- Consider adding rate limiting middleware in next sprint
- Password hashing uses bcrypt (industry standard)
```

### Example: QA Report

```markdown
## QA REPORT

### SUITE STATUS
- New test files: 2
- Updated test files: 1
- Test framework(s): pytest
- Test command(s): pytest tests/api/

### API CONFORMITY STATUS: YES

### SUMMARY
- Total endpoints in contract: 5
- Endpoints covered by automated tests: 5
- Endpoints with failing tests: 0

### FAILURES AND DEVIATIONS
None.

### TEST EXECUTION
- Tests run: YES
- Result: ALL PASS
- Notes: 23 tests passed in 1.4s

### NOTES FOR ARCHITECT
- Added edge case tests for password validation
```

### Example: UI Test Report

```markdown
## UI TEST REPORT

### MODE
AUTOMATED

### SUMMARY
- Total tests run: 8
- Passed: 7
- Failed: 1
- Session duration: 45s

### COVERAGE
- Scenarios covered:
  - Login with valid credentials
  - Login with invalid password
  - Registration flow
  - Password reset request
- Not covered (yet):
  - Email verification flow (requires email testing setup)

### FAILURES
- Scenario: Registration validation
  - Path/URL: /register
  - Symptom: Error message not displayed
  - Expected: "Email already exists" message
  - Actual: Form submits without feedback

### CONSOLE ERRORS
None.

### NOTES FOR ARCHITECT
- Registration error handling needs frontend fix
```

## Parallel Execution

### Implementation Agents

Spawn all implementation agents simultaneously:

```
Task: python-dev     ─────────▶ Backend Report
Task: nextjs-dev     ─────────▶ Frontend Report
Task: cicd-agent     ─────────▶ CICD Report
```

Use a single message with multiple Task tool calls.

### Testing Agents

QA runs first, then UI tests:

```
Task: qa-test-agent  ─────────▶ QA Report
                                    │
                                    ▼
Task: ui-test-agent  ─────────▶ UI Test Report
Task: diagnostics    ─────────▶ Diagnostics Report
     (parallel with ui-test)
```

UI test and diagnostics agents run in parallel with each other.

## Agent Constraints

### What Agents Can Do

- Read specification files
- Read project-map.md (read-only)
- Implement code in their domain
- Run tests in their domain
- Return structured reports

### What Agents Cannot Do

- Spawn other agents
- Modify `status.md` (architect only)
- Modify `project-map.md` (architect only)
- Create methodology documentation
- Push to git repositories

## File-Based Coordination

When agents need to coordinate beyond reports:

### Report Files

Orchestrator saves reports as:
```
.claude/sprint/[N]/[slug]-report-[iteration].md
```

Slugs:
- `python-dev` → `backend`
- `nextjs-dev` → `frontend`
- `qa-test-agent` → `qa`
- `ui-test-agent` → `ui-test`

## Specialized Agent Roles

### Project Architect

The decision-maker:
- Creates specification files
- Maintains project-map.md and status.md
- Analyzes agent reports
- Decides next steps (implement, test, finalize)

### Implementation Agents

Technology-specific builders:
- `python-dev`: Python/FastAPI backend
- `nextjs-dev`: Next.js frontend
- `cicd-agent`: CI/CD pipelines
- `allpurpose-agent`: Any other technology

### Testing Agents

Quality validators:
- `qa-test-agent`: API and unit tests
- `ui-test-agent`: Browser-based E2E tests
- Framework-specific diagnostics agents

## FINALIZE Signal

The architect signals sprint completion:

```markdown
FINALIZE
Phase 5 complete. Sprint [N] is finalized.
```

The orchestrator detects this and exits the iteration loop.

## Best Practices

### Report Quality

- Keep reports concise
- Focus on actionable information
- No verbose logs or stack traces
- Summarize, don't dump

### Parallel Efficiency

- Spawn independent agents together
- Don't wait unnecessarily

### Spec Adherence

- Always read specs before implementing
- Report deviations with justification
- Follow API contracts exactly
