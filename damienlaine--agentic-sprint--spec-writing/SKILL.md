# Spec Writing

Specifications drive the entire sprint workflow. Well-written specs lead to focused implementations; vague specs cause wasted iterations. This skill covers writing effective `specs.md` files that guide autonomous agents toward successful outcomes.

## The specs.md File

Located at `.claude/sprint/[N]/specs.md`, this file is the primary input to the sprint system. It tells the architect what to build and how to test it.

## Essential Structure

A complete specs.md contains:

```markdown
# Sprint [N]: [Short Title]

## Goal
[1-2 sentences describing what success looks like]

## Scope

### In Scope
- [Feature or task 1]
- [Feature or task 2]

### Out of Scope
- [What NOT to do]

## Requirements
[Detailed requirements - can be minimal or extensive]

## Testing
- QA: required / optional / skip
- UI Testing: required / optional / skip
- UI Testing Mode: automated / manual
```

## Writing Effective Goals

The goal statement shapes the entire sprint. Make it outcome-focused:

**Good goals:**
- "Users can register, login, and reset passwords"
- "API returns paginated product listings with filters"
- "Dashboard displays real-time metrics from backend"

**Bad goals:**
- "Implement authentication" (too vague)
- "Fix the bug" (which bug?)
- "Make it better" (unmeasurable)

A good goal answers: "How will we know when we're done?"

## Defining Scope

### In Scope

List concrete deliverables:
- Features to implement
- Endpoints to create
- UI components to build
- Tests to write

Be specific. "Add user profile page" is better than "improve user experience".

### Out of Scope

Explicitly exclude work to prevent scope creep:
- Related features not in this sprint
- Refactoring not needed for the goal
- Nice-to-haves for future sprints

This prevents agents from over-engineering or adding unrequested features.

## Requirements Depth

Specs can range from minimal to detailed. The architect adapts accordingly.

### Minimal Spec (One-liner)

```markdown
# Sprint 5: Add dark mode toggle

## Goal
Users can switch between light and dark themes.

## Testing
- UI Testing: required
- UI Testing Mode: manual
```

Appropriate for: Simple features, trusted architect judgment, exploratory work.

### Detailed Spec

```markdown
# Sprint 12: User Authentication

## Goal
Complete authentication flow with email verification.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Registration with email/password
- Login with session management
- Password reset via email
- Email verification flow
- Protected route middleware

### Out of Scope
- OAuth providers (future sprint)
- Two-factor authentication
- Account deletion

## Requirements

### Registration
- Email must be unique
- Password minimum 8 characters
- Send verification email on signup
- Users cannot login until verified

### Login
- Return JWT token on success
- Rate limit: 5 attempts per minute
- Lock account after 10 failed attempts

### Password Reset
- Token expires after 1 hour
- Invalidate token after use
- Send confirmation email after reset

## API Endpoints

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| POST | /auth/register | Create account |
| POST | /auth/login | Authenticate |
| POST | /auth/verify | Verify email |
| POST | /auth/reset-request | Request reset |
| POST | /auth/reset | Reset password |

## Testing
- QA: required
- UI Testing: required
- UI Testing Mode: automated
```

Appropriate for: Complex features, specific requirements, team handoffs.

## Testing Configuration

The Testing section controls which testing agents run.

### Options

| Setting | Values | Meaning |
|---------|--------|---------|
| QA | required / optional / skip | API and unit tests |
| UI Testing | required / optional / skip | Browser-based E2E tests |
| UI Testing Mode | automated / manual | Auto-run or user-driven |

### When to Use Each

**QA: required**
- New API endpoints
- Business logic changes
- Data validation rules

**QA: skip**
- Frontend-only changes
- Documentation updates
- Configuration changes

**UI Testing: required**
- User-facing features
- Form submissions
- Navigation flows

**UI Testing Mode: manual**
- Complex interactions
- Visual verification needed
- Exploratory testing

**UI Testing Mode: automated**
- Regression testing
- Standard CRUD flows
- Repeatable scenarios

## Common Patterns

### New Feature

```markdown
## Goal
[What the feature does]

## Scope
### In Scope
- Backend API
- Frontend UI
- Integration tests

## Testing
- QA: required
- UI Testing: required
- UI Testing Mode: automated
```

### Bug Fix

```markdown
## Goal
Fix [specific issue description]

## Root Cause
[If known, describe the cause]

## Expected Behavior
[What should happen]

## Testing
- QA: required  # Regression test
- UI Testing: optional
```

### Refactoring

```markdown
## Goal
Refactor [component] for [benefit]

## Constraints
- No behavior changes
- Maintain API compatibility
- All existing tests must pass

## Testing
- QA: required  # Verify no regressions
- UI Testing: skip
```

## Tips for Better Specs

### Be Specific, Not Prescriptive

Tell the architect WHAT to build, not HOW to build it:
- Good: "Users can filter products by category and price range"
- Bad: "Use a Redux slice with useSelector for filter state"

The architect chooses implementation details.

### Include Edge Cases

Mention important edge cases in requirements:
- Empty states
- Error conditions
- Boundary values
- Concurrent access

### Reference Existing Patterns

If the codebase has conventions, mention them:
- "Follow the existing auth middleware pattern"
- "Use the same validation approach as user endpoints"

### Keep It Maintainable

Specs should be readable by humans too:
- Use clear headings
- Keep bullet points short
- Include examples where helpful

## Iteration and Updates

Specs evolve during the sprint:

1. **Initial**: User writes complete specs.md
2. **Phase 1**: Architect may clarify or expand
3. **Each iteration**: Architect removes completed items
4. **Final**: Specs reflect only documented decisions

This convergent pattern keeps context focused.

## Additional Resources

The `/sprint:new` command creates specs.md templates interactively. See the command file for implementation details.
