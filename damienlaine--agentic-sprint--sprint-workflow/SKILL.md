# Sprint Workflow

Sprint implements a convergent development model where autonomous agents iteratively refine implementations until specifications are satisfied. This skill covers the execution lifecycle, phase transitions, and iteration patterns.

## Core Concept: Convergent Diffusion

Traditional AI-assisted development suffers from context bloat - each iteration adds more information, compounding errors and noise. Sprint reverses this pattern:

- **Start noisy**: Initial specs may be vague or incomplete
- **Converge iteratively**: Each iteration removes completed work from specs
- **Focus narrows**: Agents receive only remaining tasks, not history
- **Signal improves**: Less noise means better output quality

The metaphor is diffusion models in reverse - instead of adding noise to generate, remove noise to refine.

## Sprint Phases

A sprint executes through 6 distinct phases:

### Phase 0: Load Specifications

Parse the sprint directory and prepare context:
- Locate sprint directory (`.claude/sprint/[N]/`)
- Read `specs.md` for user requirements
- Read `status.md` if resuming
- Detect project type for framework-specific agents

### Phase 1: Architectural Planning

The project-architect agent analyzes requirements:
- Read existing `project-map.md` for architecture context
- Read `project-goals.md` for business objectives
- Create specification files (`api-contract.md`, `backend-specs.md`, etc.)
- Return SPAWN REQUEST for implementation agents

### Phase 2: Implementation

Spawn implementation agents in parallel:
- `python-dev` for Python/FastAPI backend
- `nextjs-dev` for Next.js frontend
- `cicd-agent` for CI/CD pipelines
- `allpurpose-agent` for any other technology
- Collect structured reports from each agent

### Phase 3: Testing

Execute testing agents:
- `qa-test-agent` runs first (API and unit tests)
- `ui-test-agent` runs after (browser-based E2E tests)
- Framework-specific diagnostics agents run in parallel with UI tests
- Collect test reports

### Phase 4: Review & Iteration

Architect reviews all reports:
- Analyze conformity status
- Update specifications (remove completed, add fixes)
- Update `status.md` with current state
- Decide: more implementation, more testing, or finalize

### Phase 5: Finalization

Sprint completion:
- Final `status.md` summary
- All specs in consistent state
- **Clean up manual-test-report.md** (no longer relevant)
- Signal FINALIZE to orchestrator

## Resuming Sprints

When running `/sprint` on an existing sprint:

**If status.md shows COMPLETE:**
- System asks: Run manual testing? Continue with fixes? Create new sprint?
- Guides user to appropriate action

**If status.md shows IN PROGRESS:**
- If manual-test-report.md exists: Uses it to inform architect
- If not: Offers to run manual testing first or continue

This ensures the user always knows where they are and what options they have.

## Iteration Loop

The sprint cycles between phases 1-4 until complete:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                         │
│  ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐  │
│  │ Phase 1  │───▶│ Phase 2          │  │
│  │ Planning │    │ Implementation   │  │
│  └──────────┘    └────────┬─────────┘  │
│       ▲                   │            │
│       │                   ▼            │
│  ┌────┴─────┐    ┌──────────────────┐  │
│  │ Phase 4  │◀───│ Phase 3          │  │
│  │ Review   │    │ Testing          │  │
│  └──────────┘    └──────────────────┘  │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼ (after max 5 iterations or success)
    ┌──────────┐
    │ Phase 5  │
    │ Finalize │
    └──────────┘
```

**Maximum 5 iterations**: The system pauses after 5 cycles to prevent infinite loops. User intervention may be needed for complex blockers.

## When to Use Sprints

Sprints are ideal for:
- Multi-component features (backend + frontend + tests)
- Complex requirements needing architectural planning
- Tasks requiring coordination between specialized agents
- Incremental development with testing validation

Sprints are overkill for:
- Simple bug fixes (use direct implementation)
- Single-file changes
- Documentation-only updates
- Quick prototypes without testing needs

## Key Artifacts

### User-Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `specs.md` | Requirements, scope, testing config |
| `project-goals.md` | Business vision and objectives |

### Architect-Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `status.md` | Current sprint state (architect maintains) |
| `project-map.md` | Technical architecture (architect maintains) |
| `api-contract.md` | Shared interface between agents |
| `*-specs.md` | Agent-specific implementation guidance |

### Orchestrator-Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `*-report-[N].md` | Agent reports per iteration |

## Convergence Principles

### Specs Shrink Over Time

After each iteration, the architect:
- Removes completed tasks from spec files
- Removes outdated information
- Keeps only remaining work

This prevents context bloat and focuses agents on actual gaps.

### Status Stays Current

`status.md` is rewritten each iteration, not appended:
- Always reflects current truth
- Maximum ~50 lines
- No historical log dumps

### Reports Are Structured

Agents return machine-parseable reports:
- Standard sections (CONFORMITY, DEVIATIONS, ISSUES)
- No verbose prose
- Actionable information only

## Manual Testing

There are two ways to do manual testing:

### Within a Sprint (specs-driven)

Set `UI Testing Mode: manual` in your specs.md:
```markdown
## Testing
- UI Testing: required
- UI Testing Mode: manual
```

When the architect requests UI testing:
1. Browser opens pointing to your app
2. You explore the app manually
3. Console errors are monitored in the background
4. **Close the browser tab** when done testing
5. Agent detects tab close and returns report
6. Sprint continues with architect review

### Standalone Testing (quick access)

Use `/sprint:test` for quick testing outside of sprints:
- Opens Chrome browser directly
- Monitors errors while you explore
- Say "finish testing" when done
- **Report saved to `.claude/sprint/[N]/manual-test-report.md`**

**Reports feed into sprints:** When you run `/sprint`, the architect reads your manual test report and prioritizes fixing the issues you discovered.

Use manual testing for:
- Exploratory testing before a sprint
- Bug hunting and discovery
- UX validation
- Edge cases hard to automate
