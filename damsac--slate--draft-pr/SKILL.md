# Draft PR

Create a pull request that walks reviewers through the developer's process — not just what changed, but how and why.

## Critical Rules

- **Understand before writing.** Review all changes from `<target_branch>..HEAD`, read related prompt files in `workflows/prompts/`, and read modified files before drafting anything.
- **Link to branch files, not relative paths.** PR descriptions render on GitHub — use `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<branch>/path` for all file links.
- **Point to documentation, don't repeat it.** If a meta entry explains a decision, link to it. Don't paste the explanation into the PR.
- **Dense > verbose.** The team iterates quickly. Every sentence should earn its place.

## Step 1: Confirm target branch and sync

Before anything else, determine the correct base branch for this PR.

1. Check the current branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. Check if there's a parent feature branch between this branch and `master`:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --graph --all | head -30
   ```
3. If the branch was created from another feature branch (not `master`), confirm the target with the human via `AskUserQuestion` — e.g., "This branch was created from `feat/initial-setup`. PR against that, or against `master`?"
4. If the branch is directly off `master`, use `master` as the base without asking.
5. Rebase on the latest target branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/<target_branch>
   ```

## Step 2: Understand the changes

Read in parallel:

1. **Diff against target**: `git log <target_branch>..HEAD --oneline` and `git diff <target_branch>..HEAD --stat` — scope the review to exactly what this PR introduces
2. **Prompt files**: Check `workflows/prompts/` for any prompt files created or modified in this branch (`git diff <target_branch>..HEAD --name-only | grep workflows/`). Read them — they contain the human's intent and Claude's execution notes.
3. **Meta entries**: Check if any meta entries were added or updated in this branch
4. **CLAUDE.md**: Check if any learnings were added or rules changed
5. **Changed files**: Read the key files that were modified — focus on infrastructure and shared code, not boilerplate

Build a mental model: what was the developer trying to do, what decisions did they make, and what should a reviewer understand?

6. **Linked issues**: Check prompt files for a non-empty `issue` field. Collect these — they'll be used to auto-close issues in the PR description.

## Step 3: Determine PR structure

Infer the PR type from the changes:

- **Files in `.claude/skills/`, `workflows/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `Makefile`, `.gitignore`** → tooling/DX change
- **Files in `Slate/Views/`, `Slate/Theme/`** → UI change
- **Files in `Slate/Models/`, `Slate/Shared/`, `SlateWidget/`** → feature or infrastructure
- **Mix of app code + new skill/workflow files** → feature with DX investment
- **Small diff, single concern** → fix or refactor

If the type is genuinely ambiguous (e.g., a large PR touching many concerns), ask the human. Otherwise, proceed — minimize human-in-the-loop when the diff speaks for itself.

### Check for dev environment impacts

Before drafting, scan the diff for changes that affect other developers' environments:

- **`flake.nix` / `flake.lock`** → new or updated Nix dependencies — devs need `direnv reload`
- **`project.yml` / `project.local.yml.template`** → Xcode project changes — devs need `make generate`, and possibly new `project.local.yml` values
- **`.envrc`** → direnv config changed
- **`Makefile`** → new or changed targets
- **New entitlements or App Group identifiers** → may require provisioning profile updates for physical devices
- **Any new env vars, config files, or secrets** → devs need to set these up locally

If any of these are present, the PR description **must** include a **"Setup / env changes"** callout section (before the checklist) so reviewers and other devs know what to do after pulling.

### Structure by type

**Feature / fix**: Lead with what changed and why. Link to the meta entry for the full story. Focus the PR on what reviewers need to verify.

**Tooling / skills**: Explain what the skill does, when to use it, and how it changes the workflow. Include a "try it" section.

## Step 4: Draft the PR description

### Structure template

```markdown
## <Opening context>
1-3 sentences: what this PR is and why it matters. Not a commit message — frame it for the reviewer.
If prompt files have linked issues, add `Closes #<number>` (one per line) so GitHub auto-closes them on merge.

---

## Step-by-step guide (for complex PRs)
Walk the reviewer through the work in the order they should understand it.
Each step: what to read/do, and WHY you're asking them to do it.
Point to files with full branch URLs.

## Key decisions (if applicable)
Table: Decision | Choice | Where to read more
Link "where to read more" to specific sections of meta entries or files.

## Architecture (if changed)
ASCII diagram of how components connect. Keep it simple.

## Setup / env changes (if applicable)
What devs need to do after pulling this branch:
- e.g. `direnv reload` (flake changed)
- e.g. Copy new key from `project.local.yml.template`
- e.g. Set `FOO_API_KEY` env var (see 1Password / team wiki)

## Checklist

### Link format

All file links must use the full branch URL:
```
https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<branch>/<path>
```

Determine owner/repo from `git remote get-url origin`. Determine branch from `git branch --show-current`.

### Diagrams

Use ASCII art in fenced code blocks (renders on GitHub). Use these when showing:
- Component relationships (app ↔ widget ↔ shared data)
- Data flow
- Workflow sequences

## Step 5: Handle commits

Check if there are uncommitted changes that should be part of this PR.

- If work is uncommitted: stage and commit with a concise message. Follow `CLAUDE.md` commit rules — update any prompt files with `commit_hash` and `status`.
- If already committed: verify the commit message is clear.
- If multiple commits: the PR description should cover the full scope, not just the latest commit.

## Step 6: Push and create PR

```bash
# Get repo info
REMOTE=$(git remote get-url origin)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
BASE=<target_branch>  # determined in Step 1

# Push
git push -u origin $BRANCH

# Create PR — prefer opening in browser so the human can review before submitting
gh pr create --base $BASE --head $BRANCH --title "<title>" --body "<body>" --web
```

**Prefer `--web`** so the human sees the PR in their browser and can edit before clicking "Create". If `--web` isn't supported or the user wants it created directly, use `--draft` to create as a draft PR.

After creation, open the PR URL in the browser:
```bash
open <pr-url>
```

## Step 7: Annotate key changes

After the PR is created, post inline review comments on files that are important for humans to understand deeply. Focus on:

- **Skills and CLAUDE.md** — these are instructions Claude follows. Explain what each section does, why it's written that way, and where Claude might misinterpret or drift. Be verbose here — reviewers need to understand these files well enough to spot when Claude is going in the wrong direction.
- **Infrastructure/shared code** — files like `PersistenceConfig.swift` or `project.yml` that multiple targets depend on. Explain the design decisions and tradeoffs.
- **Workflow files** — if new meta entries or prompt files were created, annotate the pattern so reviewers understand the documentation system.

For each comment:
- Explain the **design decision** behind the code, not just what it does
- Flag **potential drift** — where could Claude misinterpret this instruction?
- Note **connections** to other files or skills that the reviewer should understand together

Use `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/reviews --method POST --input <json-file>` to post a review with inline comments.

## Step 8: Save prompt file

Create `workflows/prompts/<unix-timestamp>.md` documenting this PR creation, per the prompt skill format. Link it to the commit.

## Style Guide

- **PR titles**: `<type>: <what>` — e.g., `feat: interactive widget checkboxes`, `fix: App Group fallback on unsigned builds`, `dx: add /prompt skill`
- **No emoji** unless the user uses them
- **Tables** for structured comparisons (decisions, file lists)
- **Code blocks** for commands, file trees, architecture diagrams
- **Bold** key terms for scan-reading
- **Arrows** (→, ←, ↔) for flow descriptions
