# Agile BA Practices Skill

## Purpose
Guide AI assistants in applying BA practices within Agile and Hybrid methodologies, balancing lightweight documentation with comprehensive analysis.

## BA Role in Agile

### Traditional BA vs Agile BA

| Aspect | Traditional BA | Agile BA |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Documentation | Comprehensive upfront | Just enough, just in time |
| Requirements | Complete before dev | Emergent, evolving |
| Deliverables | BRD, FRS, Use Cases | User stories, acceptance criteria |
| Approach | Waterfall/phases | Iterative/incremental |
| Feedback | End of project | Continuous, each sprint |
| Change | Formal change control | Embrace change |

### BA Role in Scrum

**Sprint Planning**:
- Clarify user stories with team
- Answer questions about requirements
- Help estimate complexity
- Identify dependencies

**During Sprint**:
- Available for clarification
- Accept completed stories
- Refine upcoming stories
- Write acceptance criteria

**Sprint Review**:
- Demo features with PO
- Gather stakeholder feedback
- Note change requests

**Sprint Retrospective**:
- Reflect on BA processes
- Improve collaboration

**Backlog Refinement**:
- Elaborate upcoming stories
- Add acceptance criteria
- Split large stories
- Prioritize with PO

## Core Agile BA Artifacts

### Product Backlog

**Structure**:
```
Epic > Feature > User Story > Task
```

**Example**:
```markdown
Epic: Customer Self-Service Portal
├── Feature: Account Management
│   ├── User Story: View profile
│   ├── User Story: Update profile
│   └── User Story: Change password
├── Feature: Order History
│   ├── User Story: View orders
│   └── User Story: Track shipments
└── Feature: Support
    ├── User Story: Submit ticket
    └── User Story: View FAQs
```

### User Story Template
```markdown
**Title**: [Short, descriptive title]

As a [user role]
I want [goal]
So that [benefit]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given... When... Then...
- Given... When... Then...

**Notes**: [Technical notes, wireframe links]

**Story Points**: [Estimate]
```

### Definition of Ready (DoR)

Story is Ready when:
- [ ] User story follows format (As a... I want... So that...)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are clear and testable
- [ ] Story is independent of other stories in sprint
- [ ] Story is small enough to complete in sprint
- [ ] Technical approach discussed with team
- [ ] Dependencies identified and resolved
- [ ] Wireframes/designs available (if UI work)

### Definition of Done (DoD)

Story is Done when:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code peer reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] PO accepted

## Agile Documentation Approach

### Just Enough Documentation

**Write documentation when**:
- Required for compliance/audit
- Multiple teams need to understand
- Complex business rules
- Integration specifications
- Knowledge needs to persist

**Keep lean when**:
- Small team with good communication
- Frequent face-to-face interaction
- Simple, well-understood domain
- Short project duration

### Lightweight Artifacts

| Traditional | Agile Alternative |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 100-page BRD | 1-page project brief + backlog |
| Detailed FRS | User stories + acceptance criteria |
| Use Case documents | Acceptance scenarios |
| Data dictionary | Entity definitions in stories |
| Test plan | Automated tests + DoD |

### Living Documentation

- Keep docs in version control (Git)
- Update as requirements evolve
- Use wikis (Lark, Notion, Confluence)
- Automate where possible

## Backlog Refinement

### Purpose
- Break down large stories
- Add detail to upcoming stories
- Clarify requirements
- Estimate stories
- Prioritize backlog

### Cadence
- 1-2 hours per week
- 1-2 sprints ahead
- Regular rhythm

### Refinement Activities

**Story Splitting**:
- By workflow step
- By business rule
- By data variation
- By platform (iOS/Android)
- By user role

**Estimation**:
- Planning poker
- Story points (Fibonacci)
- T-shirt sizing
- Relative sizing

**Prioritization with PO**:
- Business value
- Risk reduction
- Dependencies
- Technical debt

## Story Mapping

### What is Story Mapping?
Visual technique to organize user stories along the user journey.

### Structure
```
Activities (top row)
    ↓
Tasks (second row)
    ↓
Details/Stories (lower rows, by priority)
```

### Example: E-commerce Story Map
```
Browse Products → Add to Cart → Checkout → Order Tracking
     ↓              ↓             ↓            ↓
View catalog     Add item      Shipping      View status
Search products  Update qty    Payment       Track shipment
Filter/sort      Save for later Review order  Get notifications

MVP ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
View catalog     Add item      Shipping      View status
Search           Update qty    Payment

Release 2 ───────────────────────────────────────────
Filter/sort      Save for later Review order Track shipment
```

## Hybrid Methodology

### When to Use Hybrid
- Large enterprise projects
- Regulatory requirements
- Fixed-scope contracts
- Distributed teams
- Mixed maturity levels

### Hybrid Approach

**Waterfall Elements**:
- Initial discovery/analysis phase
- Formal BRD for approval
- Architecture design upfront
- Go-live planning

**Agile Elements**:
- Iterative development
- User stories and sprints
- Continuous delivery
- Sprint demos

### Example Hybrid Flow
```
Discovery (2-4 weeks): Requirements, BRD, Architecture
    ↓
Sprint 0: Setup, detailed design, initial stories
    ↓
Sprints 1-N: Agile development
    ↓
UAT Sprint: User acceptance testing
    ↓
Go-live: Deployment, hypercare
```

## Scaled Agile (SAFe Basics)

### Hierarchy
- **Portfolio**: Strategic initiatives
- **Program**: Agile Release Train (ART)
- **Team**: Scrum teams

### Key Roles
- Product Manager (portfolio)
- Product Owner (team)
- System Architect
- Release Train Engineer

### Key Events
- PI Planning (Program Increment)
- System Demo
- Inspect & Adapt

## Tools for Agile BA

### Backlog Management
- Jira
- Azure DevOps
- Trello
- Lark Base

### Documentation
- Lark Docs
- Notion
- Confluence

### Collaboration
- Miro/FigJam (story mapping)
- Figma (wireframes)
- Lark Meetings

## Best Practices

### Communication
✅ Face-to-face over documentation
✅ Working software over comprehensive docs
✅ Daily standups for alignment
✅ Demo early and often

### Requirements
✅ Embrace change
✅ Just-in-time elaboration
✅ Collaborative refinement
✅ Testable acceptance criteria

### Documentation
✅ Write just enough
✅ Keep it current
✅ Make it accessible
✅ Automate when possible

### Collaboration
✅ Work closely with PO
✅ Be available to team
✅ Facilitate, don't dictate
✅ Learn technical basics

## Common Anti-Patterns

❌ **Big Design Up Front**: Too much analysis before development
❌ **Requirements Dumping**: Writing stories without collaboration
❌ **Absent BA**: Not available during sprints
❌ **Gold Plating**: Over-documenting everything
❌ **Scope Denial**: Not adapting to changing requirements
