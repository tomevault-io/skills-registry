# BRD Creation Skill

## Purpose
This skill enables AI assistants to create comprehensive, professional Business Requirement Documents (BRDs) that clearly communicate business needs, objectives, and high-level requirements to stakeholders and development teams.

## When to Use This Skill
- After completing requirements elicitation
- At the start of a new project or major initiative
- When seeking executive approval and funding
- To establish project scope and boundaries
- Before creating detailed FRS documents

## What is a BRD?

A **Business Requirement Document (BRD)** is a formal document that:
- Describes the business problem or opportunity
- Defines business objectives and success criteria
- Outlines high-level business requirements
- Establishes project scope (in-scope and out-of-scope)
- Identifies stakeholders and their needs
- Documents assumptions, constraints, and dependencies

**BRD vs. FRS**:
- **BRD**: WHAT the business needs and WHY (business perspective)
- **FRS**: HOW the system will meet those needs (technical perspective)

## BRD Structure

### 1. Executive Summary
**Purpose**: Provide a concise overview for busy executives

**Contents**:
- Project name and brief description
- Business problem or opportunity (2-3 sentences)
- Proposed solution overview (2-3 sentences)
- Expected business benefits
- High-level timeline and budget
- Key success metrics

**Length**: 1 page maximum

**Writing Tips**:
- Write this section LAST (after completing the rest of the BRD)
- Use business language, not technical jargon
- Focus on business value and ROI
- Make it compelling - this may be all executives read

**Example**:
> **Project**: Mobile App Development for Customer Self-Service
>
> **Business Problem**: Customers currently must call our support center for account inquiries, order tracking, and returns, resulting in 15,000+ monthly support calls and $450K annual support costs. Customer satisfaction scores for support are 3.2/5.
>
> **Proposed Solution**: Develop a mobile application (iOS and Android) enabling customers to self-serve for common inquiries, track orders in real-time, and initiate returns without agent assistance.
>
> **Expected Benefits**: Reduce support call volume by 60% (9,000 calls/month), save $270K annually in support costs, improve customer satisfaction to 4.5/5, and increase customer retention by 15%.
>
> **Investment**: $180K development cost, 4-month timeline
>
> **ROI**: Payback in 8 months, $540K savings over 2 years

---

### 2. Business Objectives
**Purpose**: Define what the business wants to achieve

**Contents**:
- Primary business objective
- Secondary objectives
- Alignment with company strategy
- Success criteria (measurable)

**Format**: Use SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

**Example**:
> **Primary Objective**: Reduce customer support costs by 60% within 6 months of mobile app launch
>
> **Secondary Objectives**:
> 1. Improve customer satisfaction score from 3.2 to 4.5 within 3 months of launch
> 2. Increase customer retention rate by 15% within 12 months
> 3. Enable 24/7 customer self-service capabilities
>
> **Strategic Alignment**: Supports company's digital transformation initiative and customer-first strategy
>
> **Success Criteria**:
> - 70% of customers download and activate the app within 6 months
> - 60% reduction in support call volume
> - 4.5+ app store rating
> - 80% of users complete tasks without contacting support

---

### 3. Background & Context
**Purpose**: Provide context for why this project is needed

**Contents**:
- Current situation description
- History and evolution of the problem
- Previous attempts to solve (if any)
- Market or competitive drivers
- Regulatory or compliance drivers (if applicable)

**Example**:
> Our customer support center currently handles 15,000 calls per month, with 70% being routine inquiries (order status, account balance, return requests) that don't require human expertise. Industry benchmarks show that companies with self-service mobile apps reduce support costs by 50-70% while improving customer satisfaction.
>
> Our main competitors (CompanyX and CompanyY) launched mobile apps in 2024 and have seen significant improvements in customer satisfaction and retention. Customer surveys indicate that 65% of our customers prefer mobile self-service over calling support.
>
> Previous attempts to address this through a web portal in 2023 achieved only 15% adoption due to poor mobile experience and lack of push notifications for order updates.
