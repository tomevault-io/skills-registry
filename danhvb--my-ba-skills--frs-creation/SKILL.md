# FRS Creation Skill

## Purpose
Create comprehensive Functional Requirements Specifications (FRS) that provide detailed, technical requirements for development teams to implement business solutions.

## When to Use
- After BRD approval
- Before development begins
- When technical teams need detailed specifications
- For complex features requiring detailed documentation

## FRS vs BRD

| Aspect | BRD | FRS |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Audience** | Business stakeholders, executives | Technical team, developers, QA |
| **Focus** | WHAT and WHY | HOW |
| **Detail Level** | High-level business requirements | Detailed functional specifications |
| **Language** | Business language | Technical language with business context |
| **Scope** | Entire project/initiative | Specific module or feature |

## FRS Structure

### 1. Introduction
- Document purpose and scope
- Related documents (BRD, use cases, user stories)
- Intended audience
- Document conventions and terminology

### 2. System Overview
- High-level architecture
- System context diagram
- Integration points
- Technology stack (if known)

### 3. Functional Requirements

**Format for Each Requirement**:

```
FR-[MODULE]-[NUMBER]: [Requirement Title]

Description: [Detailed description of what the system shall do]

Business Rule: [Any business logic or rules]

Input: [What data/triggers initiate this function]
Process: [Step-by-step what the system does]
Output: [What the system produces/displays]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [Specific, testable criterion 1]
- [Specific, testable criterion 2]

UI/UX Notes: [Any UI specifications, wireframe references]

Dependencies: [Other requirements this depends on]

Priority: Must Have | Should Have | Could Have

Complexity: Low | Medium | High
```

**Example - E-commerce Checkout**:

```
FR-CHK-001: Guest Checkout

Description: System shall allow users to complete purchase without creating an account

Business Rule: 
- Guest users must provide email for order confirmation
- After purchase, system shall offer account creation
- Guest checkout not available for orders > $5000

Input: User clicks "Checkout as Guest" button
Process:
1. System validates cart is not empty
2. System checks order total < $5000
3. System displays shipping address form
4. System validates address using address verification API
5. System displays shipping options with real-time pricing
6. System displays payment form
7. System processes payment via Stripe
8. System creates order record with guest flag
9. System sends confirmation email
10. System displays order confirmation page with option to create account

Output: 
- Order confirmation number
- Email confirmation sent
- Order record created in database

Acceptance Criteria:
- Guest can complete checkout in < 2 minutes
- All form fields have proper validation
- Address verification catches invalid addresses
- Payment processing completes in < 5 seconds
- Confirmation email sent within 1 minute
- Order appears in admin system immediately

UI/UX Notes: See Figma wireframes (link)
- Single-page checkout design
- Progress indicator at top
- Order summary sticky on right side
- Mobile-responsive layout

Dependencies: FR-PAY-001 (Payment Processing), FR-ORD-001 (Order Creation)

Priority: Must Have
Complexity: High
```

### 4. Data Requirements

**Entity Definitions**:
- Data entities and attributes
- Data types and constraints
- Relationships between entities
- Data validation rules

**Example**:

```
Entity: Order

Attributes:
- order_id (UUID, Primary Key, Required, Auto-generated)
- customer_id (UUID, Foreign Key to Customer, Optional for guest)
- order_number (String, Unique, Format: ORD-YYYYMMDD-XXXX)
- order_date (DateTime, Required, Default: Current timestamp)
- status (Enum, Required, Values: pending|processing|shipped|delivered|cancelled)
- subtotal (Decimal(10,2), Required, Min: 0.01)
- tax (Decimal(10,2), Required, Min: 0)
- shipping_cost (Decimal(10,2), Required, Min: 0)
- total (Decimal(10,2), Required, Calculated: subtotal + tax + shipping_cost)
- shipping_address (JSON, Required)
- billing_address (JSON, Required)
- payment_method (String, Required)
- payment_status (Enum, Required, Values: pending|authorized|captured|failed|refunded)
- created_at (DateTime, Required, Auto-generated)
- updated_at (DateTime, Required, Auto-updated)

Relationships:
- One Order has many OrderItems
- One Order belongs to one Customer (optional)
- One Order has one Payment

Business Rules:
- Order number must be unique
- Total must equal subtotal + tax + shipping_cost
- Status transitions: pending → processing → shipped → delivered
- Cancelled orders cannot be modified
```

### 5. Integration Requirements

**For Each Integration**:
- External system name and purpose
- Integration type (API, File, Real-time, Batch)
- Data flow direction
- Authentication method
- Error handling
- Frequency/timing

**Example**:

```
INT-001: Stripe Payment Gateway Integration

Purpose: Process credit card payments securely

Type: REST API, Real-time

Direction: Bidirectional
- Outbound: Payment intent creation, charge capture
- Inbound: Payment confirmation, webhook notifications

Authentication: API Key (Secret key for server, Publishable key for client)

Endpoints Used:
- POST /v1/payment_intents (Create payment intent)
- POST /v1/payment_intents/{id}/confirm (Confirm payment)
- POST /v1/refunds (Process refund)

Data Mapping:
- Order.total → PaymentIntent.amount
- Order.currency → PaymentIntent.currency
- Customer.email → PaymentIntent.receipt_email

Error Handling:
- Network timeout (30 seconds): Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Payment declined: Display user-friendly error, log details
- API error: Fallback to manual payment processing, alert admin

Webhooks:
- payment_intent.succeeded → Update order status to "processing"
- payment_intent.payment_failed → Update order status to "failed", notify customer
- charge.refunded → Update order status to "refunded"

SLA: 99.9% uptime, < 2 second response time

Testing: Use Stripe test mode with test card numbers
```

### 6. Business Rules

Document all business logic and rules:

**Example**:

```
BR-001: Shipping Cost Calculation
- Orders < $50: Standard shipping $5.99, Express $12.99
- Orders $50-$99: Standard shipping $3.99, Express $9.99  
- Orders ≥ $100: Free standard shipping, Express $7.99
- International orders: Calculated by weight and destination
- Alaska/Hawaii: Add $10 to standard rates

BR-002: Discount Application
- Only one promo code per order
- Promo codes cannot be combined with sale items
- Employee discount (20%) can be combined with promo codes
- Discounts applied before tax calculation
- Minimum order value may apply per promo code

BR-003: Inventory Reservation
- Items reserved for 15 minutes when added to cart
- Reservation extended by 15 minutes on each cart update
- Reservation released after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Out-of-stock items cannot be added to cart
- Backorder items can be added if enabled for product
```

### 7. UI/UX Specifications

- Screen layouts and wireframes
- User workflows and navigation
- Form field specifications
- Validation messages
- Responsive design requirements
- Accessibility requirements

**Example**:

```

## Domain-Specific FRS Guidelines

### E-commerce FRS
**Focus**: Product catalog, cart, checkout, payment, order management
**Key Details**: Payment gateway specs, inventory logic, pricing rules, shipping calculations

### ERP FRS
**Focus**: Module workflows, approval processes, data migration, integrations
**Key Details**: Complex business rules, multi-company logic, reporting specs

### CRM FRS
**Focus**: Lead/opportunity management, sales pipeline, marketing automation
**Key Details**: Scoring algorithms, workflow automation, integration specs

### CDP FRS
**Focus**: Data collection, identity resolution, segmentation, activation
**Key Details**: Data mapping, matching logic, API specifications

### Mobile/Web FRS
**Focus**: UI/UX, offline sync, performance, platform-specific features
**Key Details**: API contracts, caching strategy, push notifications

## Best Practices

✅ **Do**:
- Be specific and detailed
- Include examples and edge cases
- Reference wireframes and diagrams
- Define all business rules explicitly
- Specify error handling
- Include acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Use consistent numbering and formatting

❌ **Don't**:
- Leave requirements ambiguous
- Skip error scenarios
- Assume developers know business context
- Mix multiple requirements in one
- Forget about edge cases
- Ignore non-functional requirements

## Tools

- **Lark Docs**: Collaborative FRS writing
- **Notion**: Requirements database with linking
- **Figma**: Wireframes and UI specifications
- **Mermaid**: Diagrams in markdown

## Next Steps

After FRS completion:
1. Technical review with development team
2. Create use cases (see `use-case-documentation` skill)
3. Write user stories (see `user-story-writing` skill)
4. Define acceptance criteria (see `acceptance-criteria` skill)
5. Plan UAT (see `uat-planning` skill)
