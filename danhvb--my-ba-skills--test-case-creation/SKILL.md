# Test Case Creation Skill

## Purpose
Translate requirements into executable steps to verify the system works as expected. While QA executes tests, BAs often define the *scenarios* to ensure business logic is covered.

## When to Use
- During Requirements phase (to ensure testability).
- UAT Planning (writing scripts for users).
- Reviewing QA Test Plans (validation).

## Anatomy of a Good Test Case

1.  **ID**: Unique (e.g., TC-001).
2.  **Title**: Concise summary.
3.  **Preconditions**: Setup required (e.g., "User logged in").
4.  **Test Steps**: Step-by-step actions using imperative verbs ("Click", "Enter", "Verify").
5.  **Test Data**: Specific data used (e.g., "Email: test@example.com").
6.  **Expected Result**: What should happen? (Specific).
7.  **Postconditions**: State after test (e.g., "Order created in DB").

## Types of BA Test Cases

### 1. Happy Path (Positive)
The standard flow working perfectly.
- "User enters valid email/pass -> Logs in successfully."

### 2. Negative Path (Error Handling)
Trying to break it / Invalid inputs.
- "User enters invalid email -> Shows error message 'Invalid format'."

### 3. Edge Cases (Boundary)
Testing limits.
- "User enters exactly 255 characters (max) -> Accepted."
- "User enters 256 characters -> Rejected."

### 4. Business Logic / Complex Flow
Multi-step scenarios.
- "User adds item -> Apply Discount -> Remove Item -> Verify Total recalculates."

## Test Case Template

**Scenario: Apply Promo Code**

| ID | TC-PROMO-01 |
|----|-------------|
| **Description** | Verify 'SUMMER20' gives 20% discount. |
| **Preconditions** | User has $100 item in cart. |
| **Steps** | 1. Navigate to Cart.<br>2. Enter 'SUMMER20' in promo field.<br>3. Click 'Apply'. |
| **Expected Result** | 1. Success message 'Code Applied'.<br>2. Discount line shows -$20.00.<br>3. Total is $80.00. |

## Traceability
Ensure every Test Case links back to a Requirement (FR).
- `TC-PROMO-01` <--> `FR-CART-05` (Promo Codes).

## Best Practices
- **One Verification per Test**: Don't test 10 things in one case. If one fails, the whole case fails.
- **Be Specific**: Don't say "Check result". Say "Verify text says 'Success'".
- **Clean Up**: Tests should clean up data (Postconditions) so the next test isn't blocked.

## Tools
- **Lark Base / Excel**: Simple test tracking.
- **Jira / Zephyr / Xray**: Integrated test management.
- **TestRail**: Dedicated test tool.
