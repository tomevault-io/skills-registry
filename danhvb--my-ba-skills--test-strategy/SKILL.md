# Test Strategy Design Skill

## Purpose
Enable the QA Lead Agent to define the overall approach to quality assurance for a project, ensuring all risks are mitigated through appropriate testing.

## Test Pyramid Strategy
Based on Mike Cohn's Test Pyramid:
1.  **Unit Tests (70%)**: Component level, fast, isolated. (Dev responsibility)
2.  **Integration Tests (20%)**: API level, service interaction. (Dev/QA responsibility)
3.  **E2E / UI Tests (10%)**: User journey, slow, fragile. (QA responsibility)

## Test Plan Components

### 1. Scope
- **In Scope**: Modules, browsers (Chrome, Safari), devices (iOS, Android).
- **Out of Scope**: Performance (unless specified), third-party system internals.

### 2. Testing Types
- **Functional**: Sanity, Smoke, Regression.
- **Non-Functional**: Performance, Security, Accessibility, Usability.

### 3. Environment Strategy
- **Dev**: Unstable, for unit tests.
- **QA/Staging**: Stable, mirror of Prod, for functional/regression.
- **Prod**: For smoke tests / monitoring.

### 4. Data Strategy
- Synthetic data generation?
- Anonymized prod dump?
- Hardcoded test users?

## Automation Framework Design

### Selection Criteria
- **Tech Stack**: Playwright (JS/TS), Selenium (Java/Python), Cypress (JS).
- **CI/CD Integration**: Github Actions, Jenkins.
- **Reporting**: Allure, HTML reports.

### Best Practices
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Separation of page structure from tests.
- **Atomic Tests**: Each test is independent.
- **Data Driven**: Separate data from logic.

## Risk-Based Testing
Prioritize testing based on:
- **Impact**: What happens if this fails? (Financial loss, data loss?)
- **Probability**: How likely is it to fail? (New complex code vs. old stable code).

## Deliverables
- Master Test Plan (MTP).
- Test Case Suite.
- Defect Reports.
- Test Summary Report.
