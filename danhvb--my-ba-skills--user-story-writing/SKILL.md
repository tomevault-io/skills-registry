## Story Hierarchy

### Epic → Feature → User Story → Task

**Epic**: Large body of work (multiple sprints)
```
Epic: Mobile App Customer Self-Service
Goal: Enable customers to manage accounts via mobile app
Timeline: Q1 2026
Stories: 25-30 stories
```

**Feature**: Group of related stories (1-3 sprints)
```
Feature: Order Management in Mobile App
Stories: View orders, Track shipments, Initiate returns
Sprint: Sprint 5-6
```

**User Story**: Single piece of functionality (1 sprint)
```
Story: View Order History
Tasks: API integration, UI development, Offline caching
Sprint: Sprint 5
```

**Task**: Technical implementation step (hours/days)
```
Task: Implement order list API endpoint
Estimate: 4 hours
```

## Acceptance Criteria Formats

### Given-When-Then (Gherkin)
```
Given [context/precondition]
When [action/event]
Then [expected outcome]
```

**Example**:
```
Given I am a logged-in customer
When I click "View Orders"
Then I see a list of my orders sorted by date (newest first)
```

### Checklist Format
```
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3
```

**Example**:
```
- [ ] Order list displays order number, date, total, status
- [ ] Orders are paginated (20 per page)
- [ ] User can filter by status (All, Processing, Shipped, Delivered)
- [ ] User can search by order number
- [ ] Clicking an order opens order details
```

### Scenario-Based
```
Scenario 1: [Happy path]
Scenario 2: [Alternative path]
Scenario 3: [Error case]
```

## Story Splitting Techniques

### When a story is too large (>13 points), split by:

**1. Workflow Steps**
- Original: "User can complete checkout"
- Split: "Enter shipping info", "Select shipping method", "Enter payment", "Review order"

**2. Business Rules**
- Original: "Calculate shipping costs"
- Split: "Standard shipping", "Express shipping", "International shipping"

**3. CRUD Operations**
- Original: "Manage products"
- Split: "Create product", "Update product", "Delete product", "View products"

**4. Data Variations**
- Original: "Import customer data"
- Split: "Import from CSV", "Import from Excel", "Import from API"

**5. Platforms**
- Original: "Mobile app checkout"
- Split: "iOS checkout", "Android checkout"

**6. Simple/Complex**
- Original: "Search products"
- Split: "Basic keyword search", "Advanced filters", "Faceted search"

## Story Estimation

### Story Points (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)

- **1 point**: Trivial change (few hours)
- **2 points**: Simple feature (half day)
- **3 points**: Straightforward feature (1 day)
- **5 points**: Moderate complexity (2-3 days)
- **8 points**: Complex feature (3-5 days)
- **13 points**: Very complex (5-8 days) - consider splitting
- **21+ points**: Too large - must split

### T-Shirt Sizing (Alternative)
- **XS**: 1-2 points
- **S**: 3-5 points
- **M**: 8 points
- **L**: 13 points
- **XL**: 21+ points (split required)

## Definition of Ready (DoR)

Story is ready for sprint when:
- [ ] User story follows INVEST criteria
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are clear and testable
- [ ] Dependencies identified and resolved
- [ ] Wireframes/mockups available (if UI work)
- [ ] Business rules documented
- [ ] Story estimated by team
- [ ] Priority assigned
- [ ] Technical approach discussed

## Definition of Done (DoD)

Story is complete when:
- [ ] Code complete and peer reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Product owner approved

## Best Practices

✅ **Do**:
- Write from user perspective
- Focus on value, not implementation
- Keep stories small and focused
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Involve the team in writing stories
- Refine stories before sprint planning
- Link stories to epics and features

❌ **Don't**:
- Write technical tasks as user stories
- Make stories too large (>13 points)
- Skip acceptance criteria
- Write vague or ambiguous stories
- Include implementation details
- Create dependencies between stories in same sprint

## Tools

### Lark
- Use Lark Base for backlog management
- Create story template with custom fields
- Link stories to epics and sprints
- Track story status and progress

### Notion
- Create user story database
- Use kanban board for sprint planning
- Link stories to requirements and test cases
- Template for consistent story format

## Common Patterns

### E-commerce
- As a customer, I want [shopping/checkout feature]
- As an admin, I want [product/order management]
- As a merchant, I want [analytics/reporting]

### CRM
- As a sales rep, I want [lead/opportunity management]
- As a manager, I want [pipeline/forecasting]
- As a marketer, I want [campaign/automation]

### ERP
- As a user, I want [process automation]
- As an approver, I want [workflow management]
- As an admin, I want [configuration/setup]

### Mobile/Web
- As a mobile user, I want [on-the-go features]
- As a user, I want [responsive/accessible UI]
- As a user, I want [offline capabilities]

## Next Steps

After writing user stories:
1. Refine with team during backlog grooming
2. Create acceptance criteria (see `acceptance-criteria` skill)
3. Estimate during planning poker
4. Break into technical tasks
5. Link to test cases for UAT
