description: Deploy ServiceNow configuration changes safely — either via Update Sets (classic instances) or now-sdk install (Fluent SDK projects). Covers Update Set naming, parent/child batching, preview validation, and SDK build/install workflows. Use when managing releases, migrating between instances, promoting changes from dev to test to prod, or orchestrating complex deployments with multiple Update Sets. Trigger this skill whenever the user mentions deployment, Update Sets, moving changes between environments, release management, or now-sdk install. Use when this capability is needed.

# ServiceNow Deployment

## Quick start

**Update Set naming convention**:

```
[App Name] - [Story ID] - [Brief Description]

Example:
ITIL - STORY-1234 - Add approval routing for high-priority incidents
```

**Batching strategy** (parent/child pattern):

```
Parent Update Set (orchestrates order)
├── Child Update Set 1 (dependencies)
├── Child Update Set 2 (main logic)
└── Child Update Set 3 (cleanup)
```

## Deployment process

1. **Capture phase**: Select only objects needed; use filters to exclude system changes
2. **Preview phase**: Resolve all errors:
   - Accept Remote: Keep target system changes
   - Skip: Ignore conflicting source changes
3. **Commit phase**: Only after preview succeeds
4. **Verify phase**: Test functionality on target instance

## Critical rules

| Rule | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Use Parent/Child batches | Maintains deployment order; enables rollback |
| Never merge sets | Destructive; loses change history |
| Preview before commit | Catches conflicts early |
| Unique naming | Enables audit trail and troubleshooting |

## Best practices

- Keep Update Sets focused (one feature per set)
- Document customizations in the Description field
- Test on sub-production before production
- Create parent sets for new applications
- Version track all custom objects
- Backup production before large deployments
- Review all preview errors before committing
- Use descriptive names with story/ticket IDs

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Update Set | Container for configuration changes |
| Parent Update Set | Orchestrates multiple child sets |
| Preview | Validation step before commit |
| Remote Update Set | Update Set on target instance |
| Collision | Conflicting changes between instances |
