# VS Code Copilot Customization

## Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to recommend the right customization type. Always start here.

| Scenario                                                            | Best choice                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Project-wide coding standards, always active                        | `copilot-instructions.md`          |
| Rules only for specific file types / folders                        | `*.instructions.md` with `applyTo` |
| Works with multiple AI agents (Claude, Copilot, etc.)               | `AGENTS.md`                        |
| Reusable task you invoke manually in chat                           | Prompt file (`.prompt.md`)         |
| Specialized workflow with tool restrictions or model choice         | Custom agent (`.agent.md`)         |
| Portable capability reusable across projects + CLI + cloud agents   | Agent skill (`SKILL.md`)           |
| Auto-run commands at agent lifecycle points (format, lint, enforce) | Hook (`.json`)                     |
| Bundle multiple customizations to share or distribute               | Agent plugin (`plugin.json`)       |

### Quick decision flow

```
Do you want it ON automatically for every request?
├─ YES → Instructions (.instructions.md / copilot-instructions.md / AGENTS.md)
└─ NO, I invoke it manually →
       Does it need persistent persona, tool restrictions, or model choice?
       ├─ YES → Custom Agent (.agent.md)
       └─ NO →
              Is it a reusable multi-agent portable capability?
              ├─ YES → Agent Skill (SKILL.md)
              └─ NO → Prompt File (.prompt.md)

Do you want to run shell commands around agent actions?
└─ YES → Hook (hooks/*.json)

Do you want to bundle everything for distribution?
└─ YES → Agent Plugin (plugin.json)
```

## 1. Custom Instructions

Always-on context and rules. Stored in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (workspace-wide), `AGENTS.md` (multi-agent), or `*.instructions.md` (file-scoped via `applyTo` glob).

Read `references/instructions.md` when asked to create, write, or configure custom instructions.

---

## 2. Prompt Files

Reusable task templates invoked manually via `/` slash command. Stored in `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`.

Read `references/prompt-files.md` when asked to create a prompt file or reusable chat task.

---

## 3. Custom Agents

Specialized Copilot persona with tool whitelist, model choice, and optional handoffs. Stored in `.github/agents/*.agent.md`.

Read `references/custom-agents.md` when asked to create a custom agent or chat mode.

---

## 4. Agent Skills

Portable, progressive-loading capabilities that work across VS Code, Copilot CLI, and cloud agents. Stored in `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

Read `references/agent-skills.md` when asked to create a skill or when the user asks about SKILL.md format, frontmatter fields, or skill best practices.

---

## 5. Hooks

Shell commands triggered at agent lifecycle events (`PostToolUse`, `Stop`, etc.). Stored in `.github/hooks/*.json`.

Read `references/hooks.md` when asked to create a hook, set up auto-formatting, or run commands around agent actions.

---

## 6. Agent Plugins

Bundle skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers for distribution. Defined in `plugin.json`.

Read `references/plugins.md` when asked to create, publish, or install an agent plugin.
