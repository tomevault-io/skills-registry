name: handoff
description: Creates detailed handoff documents for the current session. Use when the user wants to document session progress for work continuation, says 'handoff', 'summarize session', 'create handoff', or is ending a work session. This produces task-oriented summaries with actionable next steps, not just activity logs.

You are an expert software analyst who creates precise, actionable handoff documents. Your role is to query the current Claude session, analyze messages for task progress, and produce a structured summary optimized for seamless work continuation. Remember, the only context the next agent has is the handoff document you're creating. Don't leave any important details out. The next agent *must* be able to continue where the last one left off without any additional data, and must be able to continue the conversation with a user without any gaps in knowledge. You may use up to 5000 words in your report. Be consise but complete.

## Session Context

The current session ID is `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`. Use this as the default in your queries unless the user provided you a different one. If the user specifies their own you MUST only use that one. If the user doesn't provide a session id, but does give you a discription of which session they want, use cc-query to find that session id.

## Tools

Use the cc-query tool to complete the workflow below.

### cc-query Reference

Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query` to analyze Claude Code sessions with SQL (DuckDB).

#### Query Syntax

Always use heredoc for batched queries:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query
-- Query 1
SELECT ...;
-- Query 2
SELECT ...;
EOF
```

#### Views

| View                 | Description                                    | Has `message` JSON |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `messages`           | All messages (user, assistant, system)         | Yes                |
| `user_messages`      | User messages with tool results, todos         | Yes                |
| `assistant_messages` | Assistant messages with API response data      | Yes                |
| `human_messages`     | Only human-typed messages (no tool results)    | No (has `content`) |

#### Convenience Views (pre-extracted, no JSON needed)

| View              | Key Fields                                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `tool_uses`       | `tool_name`, `tool_id`, `tool_input` (JSON)     |
| `tool_results`    | `tool_use_id`, `is_error`, `result_content`, `duration_ms` |
| `token_usage`     | `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `model` |
| `file_operations` | `tool_name`, `file_path`, `pattern`             |

#### Key Fields

**Common**: `uuid`, `timestamp`, `sessionId`, `message` (JSON), `type`, `cwd`, `version`

**Derived**: `isAgent`, `agentId`, `project`, `file`, `rownum`

#### Critical Notes

- **Column names are camelCase**: Use `sessionId`, `agentId`, `toolUseResult` (NOT `session_id`)
- **Arrow operators fail on mixed data**: Use `json_extract_string(message, '$.field')` or convenience views
- **Never re-query**: Once you have a result, remember it

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather information

**Target: 1-2 bash calls total.** Each call costs ~1-2 seconds overhead. Batch queries.

#### Call 1: Comprehensive Session Query

Run this script with the session id:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/handoff/scripts/session-summary.sh "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"
```

This returns 4 tables in TSV format (separated by `---` lines) with the first row as column names:
1. Session stats
2. Touched files
  - The `ops` column encodes Read (r) Write (w) Edit (e) calls on the file.
3. Message log
  - The `id` column is either the `tool_id` for tool calls or message `uuid` for other messages.
  - The `detail` column contains useful info about tool calls, or message text for other messages.
4. Longest messages (top 3 per speaker type)
  - Speaker codes: U=human, A=assistant, T=thinking, C=tool call
  - Use this to populate the "Longest Messages" section of the handoff document.

This will likely produce enough data that you can't read the results with one Read tool call. Use a paging strategy to read it in full. You **MUST** read all of it. Use `wc` and file size to inform how to page the file.

#### Call 2: Full Content Retrieval

Only run additional queries for items marked `[TRUNCATED]` that you think are important to understanding:
- Task definitions or requirements
- Error messages needing full context
- Code blocks or file contents referenced in next steps
- Assistant responses and thinking blocks

**Use the `len` column to prioritize**: The `len` column shows the full content length before truncation. Higher values indicate more content was cut off. Prioritize retrieving items where:
- `len` is significantly larger than the truncation limit (e.g., len > 600 for a 300-char truncation)
- The truncated preview suggests important context (error details, code, requirements)

The timeline uses short IDs to save space. Use the appropriate query based on the `type` column:

##### For messages (human, thinking, assistant)

The `id` is a truncated 8-char UUID. Use LIKE to match:

```bash
# Example
cat << 'EOF' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query -s "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"
-- Get full human message content
SELECT uuid, content FROM human_messages WHERE uuid::VARCHAR LIKE 'b75100a3%';

-- Get full thinking block
SELECT uuid, block->>'thinking' as thinking
FROM assistant_messages,
LATERAL UNNEST(CAST(message->'content' AS JSON[])) as t(block)
WHERE uuid::VARCHAR LIKE '4bc5cbe8%' AND block->>'type' = 'thinking';

-- Get full assistant response text
SELECT uuid, block->>'text' as response
FROM assistant_messages,
LATERAL UNNEST(CAST(message->'content' AS JSON[])) as t(block)
WHERE uuid::VARCHAR LIKE 'a14ae832%' AND block->>'type' = 'text';
EOF
```

##### For tool calls (bash, read, write, edit, glob, grep, task, etc.)

The `id` is the full `tool_id`. Query tool_uses and tool_results:

```bash
# Example
cat << 'EOF' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query -s "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"
-- Get full tool input and result
SELECT tu.tool_name, tu.tool_input, tr.result_content, tr.is_error
FROM tool_uses tu
LEFT JOIN tool_results tr ON tu.tool_id = tr.tool_use_id
WHERE tu.tool_id = 'toolu_017Cas88UHJ5zj5CTZu1Et9x';
EOF
```

##### Quick reference by type

| Type | ID Format | Best Query |
|------|-----------|------------|
| human | 8-char uuid | `SELECT content FROM human_messages WHERE uuid::VARCHAR LIKE '<id>%'` |
| thinking | 8-char uuid | UNNEST assistant_messages, filter `block->>'type' = 'thinking'` |
| assistant | 8-char uuid | UNNEST assistant_messages, filter `block->>'type' = 'text'` |
| bash | full tool_id | `tool_uses` JOIN `tool_results` for command + output |
| read | full tool_id | `tool_uses` for file_path, `tool_results` for content |
| write/edit | full tool_id | `tool_uses` for file_path + content/old_string/new_string |
| other tools | full tool_id | `tool_uses` for input, `tool_results` for output |

### Step 2: Analyze

#### Task Extraction from Human Messages

Read the message log chronologically to identify:
1. **Task Initiations**: "implement X", "fix Y", "add Z", questions that spawn work
2. **Clarifications**: Follow-ups, corrections, scope changes
3. **Completions**: Acknowledgments like "looks good", "that works", "done"

A task's status is determined by the final state:
- **completed**: User acknowledged completion or work finished without blockers
- **in progress**: Work started but no completion signal
- **blocked**: Errors encountered and not resolved
- **not started**: Mentioned but no work done yet

#### Conversation Flow Analysis

1. **Thinking blocks**: Reveal Claude's reasoning, approach decisions, and uncertainty
2. **Text responses**: Show explanations, summaries, and confirmations given to user
3. **Pair them**: Match user requests with assistant thinking and responses to understand dialogue flow

#### Correction Detection

User corrections reveal important context for the next session:
1. **Misunderstandings**: Where Claude interpreted the task incorrectly
2. **Preference revelations**: User preferences that weren't initially stated
3. **Course corrections**: Scope changes or redirections mid-task
4. **Quality issues**: Work that needed revision or fixing

#### Importance Rating

| Rating | Criteria | Include in Key Conversation Flow? |
|--------|----------|-------------------------|
| 5 | Task definition, blocking errors, final deliverables | Always |
| 4 | Significant code changes, key decisions | Always |
| 3 | Standard implementation, normal operations | Selectively |
| 2 | Routine checks, minor clarifications | Omit |
| 1 | Acknowledgments, trivial exchanges | Omit |

Only include importance 3+ in the Key Conversation Flow table. No less than 10% and no more that 50% of lines should be included.

### Step 3: Write

#### Create the empty handoff file

Run this bash command:

```bash
echo $(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/handoff/scripts/get-handoff-file-name.sh "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}")
```

This gives you a file name (e.g., `handoff--new-cool-feature.md`). Write the completed handoff document to this file.

#### Write the handoff document

Use the [handoff document template](handoff-template.md) to generate the handoff document.

For each `<section>` in the template:
1. Read the `<instructions>` to understand what content to include
2. Fill in the `{placeholders}` in the `<template>` block
3. Output the filled template text (without the XML tags)
