# Querying Session Data

Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query` to analyze Claude Code sessions with SQL (DuckDB).

## Query Planning (Read This First)

**Each bash call costs ~1-2 seconds** (DuckDB init + JSONL parsing). A session with 20 separate queries wastes 20-40 seconds on overhead alone.

**Before running any query:**
1. List all questions you need answered
2. Combine them into 1-2 heredoc batches
3. Store results mentally - never re-run the same query

**Standard pattern:**
```bash
cat << 'EOF' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query
-- Query 1
SELECT ...;
-- Query 2
SELECT ...;
-- Query 3
SELECT ...;
EOF
```

## Quick Start

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query                    # All projects
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query ~/code/myproject   # Specific project
```

**IMPORTANT**: Always use heredoc (not echo). This enables batching:
```bash
cat << 'EOF' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query
SELECT count(*) FROM messages;
EOF
```

## Use Cases

**Analyzing a specific session**: See [session-analysis.md](session-analysis.md) for templates and output format.

## Reference

**Schema details**: Run `echo '.schema' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query` if you need the full schema.

**JSON queries**: See [json-queries.md](json-queries.md) for working with the `message` JSON field.

**Advanced patterns**: See [advanced-queries.md](advanced-queries.md) for complex analysis query ideas.

## Views

### Base Views

| View                 | Description                                    | Has `message` JSON |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `messages`           | All messages (user, assistant, system)         | ✓                  |
| `user_messages`      | User messages with tool results, todos         | ✓                  |
| `assistant_messages` | Assistant messages with API response data      | ✓                  |
| `system_messages`    | System messages (hooks, retries, tool output)  | ✗ (has `content`)  |
| `human_messages`     | Only human-typed messages (no tool results)    | ✗ (has `content`)  |
| `raw_messages`       | Raw JSON (uuid + full JSON string)             | ✗ (has `raw`)      |

### Convenience Views (pre-extracted, no JSON needed)

| View              | Key Fields                                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `tool_uses`       | `tool_name`, `tool_id`, `tool_input` (JSON)     |
| `tool_results`    | `tool_use_id`, `is_error`, `result_content`, `duration_ms` |
| `token_usage`     | `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `model` |
| `bash_commands`   | `command`, `description`, `timeout`             |
| `file_operations` | `tool_name`, `file_path`, `pattern`             |

## Key Fields

**Common**: `uuid`, `timestamp`, `sessionId`, `message` (JSON), `type`, `cwd`, `version`

**Derived**: `isAgent`, `agentId`, `project`, `file`, `rownum`

**User-specific**: `toolUseResult`, `sourceToolAssistantUUID`, `todos`, `isMeta`

**human_messages only**: `content` (VARCHAR) - extracted text, not JSON

## Example Queries

### Recent human messages (what did we work on)
```sql
SELECT timestamp, left(content, 100) as message
FROM human_messages
ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Recent sessions
```sql
SELECT sessionId, min(timestamp) as started, max(timestamp) as ended, count(*) as msgs
FROM messages
GROUP BY sessionId ORDER BY started DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Message counts
```sql
SELECT type, count(*) as cnt FROM messages GROUP BY type ORDER BY cnt DESC;
```

### Token usage
```sql
-- Using convenience view (recommended)
SELECT sum(input_tokens) as input, sum(output_tokens) as output, sum(cache_read_tokens) as cached
FROM token_usage;

-- Or with raw JSON
SELECT sum(CAST(message->'usage'->>'input_tokens' AS BIGINT)) as input,
       sum(CAST(message->'usage'->>'output_tokens' AS BIGINT)) as output,
       sum(CAST(message->'usage'->>'cache_read_input_tokens' AS BIGINT)) as cache_hits
FROM assistant_messages;
```

### Most used tools
```sql
-- Using convenience view (recommended)
SELECT tool_name, count(*) as uses FROM tool_uses GROUP BY tool_name ORDER BY uses DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Or with raw JSON (json_extract_string required for mixed message types)
SELECT json_extract_string(message, '$.content[0].name') as tool, count(*) as uses
FROM messages WHERE type = 'assistant'
  AND json_extract_string(message, '$.content[0].type') = 'tool_use'
GROUP BY tool ORDER BY uses DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Agent vs main session
```sql
SELECT isAgent, count(*) as messages, count(DISTINCT agentId) as agents
FROM messages
GROUP BY isAgent;
```

### Project comparison
```sql
SELECT project, count(*) as messages
FROM messages
GROUP BY project
ORDER BY messages DESC;
```

### Tool durations
```sql
-- Using convenience view (recommended)
SELECT tool_use_id, duration_ms, left(result_content, 50) as preview
FROM tool_results WHERE duration_ms IS NOT NULL ORDER BY duration_ms DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Or with raw JSON
SELECT CAST(toolUseResult->>'durationMs' AS INTEGER) as duration_ms,
       left(message->'content'->0->>'content', 50) as result_preview
FROM user_messages WHERE toolUseResult IS NOT NULL ORDER BY duration_ms DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## Critical Notes

**Use convenience views for tool analysis**: The `tool_uses`, `tool_results`, `bash_commands`, `file_operations`, and `token_usage` views pre-extract common fields so you don't need JSON functions:
```sql
SELECT tool_name, count(*) FROM tool_uses GROUP BY tool_name;  -- Simple!
```

**Column names are camelCase**: Use `sessionId`, `agentId`, `toolUseResult` (NOT `session_id`, `agent_id`)

**Arrow operators fail on mixed data**: When using base views (`assistant_messages`, `messages`), arrow operators like `message->'content'->0->>'name'` cause "Conversion Error" because rows have different JSON structures. Use `json_extract_string()` or convenience views:
```sql
-- FAILS: message->'content'->0->>'name'
-- WORKS: json_extract_string(message, '$.content[0].name')
-- BEST:  SELECT tool_name FROM tool_uses
```

## JSON Access

- `json_extract_string(message, '$.field')` - **preferred**, handles mixed types
- `message->'field'` returns JSON (use only when all rows have same structure)
- `message->>'field'` returns string (same caveat)
- `message->'content'->0` array access (0-indexed)
- `UNNEST(CAST(json_array AS JSON[]))` expands arrays
- **Precedence gotcha**: Use parentheses with `IS NULL`: `(message->'usage') IS NOT NULL`

## Efficiency Guidelines

**Target: 1-2 tool calls per analysis.** Each bash call = ~1-2 seconds overhead.

| Calls | Overhead | Verdict |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1-2   | 2-4s     | Good    |
| 5-10  | 10-20s   | Wasteful |
| 20+   | 40s+     | Unacceptable |

### Two-Call Pattern for Unknown Sessions

**Call 1: Discovery** - Find what you're looking for:
```bash
cat << 'EOF' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query
-- Recent sessions
SELECT sessionId, project, min(timestamp) as started, max(timestamp) as ended, count(*) as msgs
FROM messages GROUP BY sessionId, project ORDER BY started DESC LIMIT 10;
EOF
```

**Call 2: Deep Analysis** - Query the specific session(s):
```bash
cat << 'EOF' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query
-- Replace SESSION_ID with ID from Call 1
SELECT count(*) as msgs, count(DISTINCT agentId) as agents FROM messages WHERE sessionId = 'SESSION_ID';
SELECT tool_name, count(*) FROM tool_uses WHERE sessionId = 'SESSION_ID' GROUP BY tool_name ORDER BY count(*) DESC;
SELECT timestamp, left(content, 300) FROM human_messages WHERE sessionId = 'SESSION_ID' ORDER BY timestamp;
EOF
```

### Combine keyword searches with OR
```sql
-- BAD: 5 separate queries for each keyword
-- GOOD: One query with all patterns
SELECT timestamp, left(content, 300) FROM human_messages
WHERE lower(content) LIKE '%fix%'
   OR lower(content) LIKE '%wrong%'
   OR lower(content) LIKE '%instead%'
   OR lower(content) LIKE '%prefer%'
   OR lower(content) LIKE '%should%'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### Use CTEs for repeated filters
```sql
WITH clean_messages AS (
  SELECT * FROM human_messages
  WHERE content NOT LIKE '%<local-command%'
    AND content NOT LIKE '%<command-name%'
    AND length(content) > 20
)
SELECT timestamp, content FROM clean_messages
WHERE lower(content) LIKE '%error%';
```

### Never Re-Query
Once you have a result, remember it. Don't run the same query again to "verify" or "check".

## Common Analysis Patterns

### Cross-Project Overview (Single Call)
```bash
cat << 'EOF' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query
-- Project activity
SELECT project, count(*) as msgs, count(DISTINCT sessionId) as sessions,
       max(timestamp) as last_activity FROM messages GROUP BY project ORDER BY last_activity DESC LIMIT 10;
-- Tool patterns across all projects
SELECT tool_name, count(*) as uses FROM tool_uses GROUP BY tool_name ORDER BY uses DESC LIMIT 15;
-- Error-prone commands
SELECT left(command, 80) as cmd, count(*) as errors
FROM bash_commands bc JOIN tool_results tr ON bc.tool_id = tr.tool_use_id
WHERE tr.is_error GROUP BY cmd ORDER BY errors DESC LIMIT 10;
EOF
```

### Find user corrections/preferences (for CLAUDE.md insights)
```sql
SELECT timestamp, left(content, 400) as content
FROM human_messages
WHERE content NOT LIKE '%<local-command%'
  AND content NOT LIKE '%<command-name%'
  AND length(content) > 20
  AND (
    lower(content) LIKE '%instead%'
    OR lower(content) LIKE '%wrong%'
    OR lower(content) LIKE '%fix%'
    OR lower(content) LIKE '%prefer%'
    OR lower(content) LIKE '%should%'
    OR lower(content) LIKE '%don''t%'
    OR lower(content) LIKE '%please%'
  )
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### Weekly Summary (Single Call)
```bash
cat << 'EOF' | ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cc-query
-- Sessions this week
SELECT date_trunc('day', timestamp) as day, count(DISTINCT sessionId) as sessions, count(*) as msgs
FROM messages WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL '7 days' GROUP BY day ORDER BY day;
-- What we worked on
SELECT left(content, 200) as topic FROM human_messages
WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL '7 days' AND length(content) > 30
  AND content NOT LIKE '%<local-command%' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 20;
-- Token consumption
SELECT sum(input_tokens) as input, sum(output_tokens) as output FROM token_usage WHERE timestamp > now() - INTERVAL '7 days';
EOF
```
