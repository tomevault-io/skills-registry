Vue.js testing best practices, patterns, and common gotchas.

### Testing

- Setting up test infrastructure for Vue 3 projects → See [testing-vitest-recommended-for-vue](references/testing-vitest-recommended-for-vue.md)
- Tests keep breaking when refactoring component internals → See [testing-component-blackbox-approach](references/testing-component-blackbox-approach.md)
- Tests fail intermittently with race conditions → See [testing-async-await-flushpromises](references/testing-async-await-flushpromises.md)
- Composables using lifecycle hooks or inject fail to test → See [testing-composables-helper-wrapper](references/testing-composables-helper-wrapper.md)
- Getting "injection Symbol(pinia) not found" errors in tests → See [testing-pinia-store-setup](references/testing-pinia-store-setup.md)
- Components with async setup won't render in tests → See [testing-suspense-async-components](references/testing-suspense-async-components.md)
- Snapshot tests keep passing despite broken functionality → See [testing-no-snapshot-only](references/testing-no-snapshot-only.md)
- Choosing end-to-end testing framework for Vue apps → See [testing-e2e-playwright-recommended](references/testing-e2e-playwright-recommended.md)
- Tests need to verify computed styles or real DOM events → See [testing-browser-vs-node-runners](references/testing-browser-vs-node-runners.md)
- Testing components created with defineAsyncComponent fails → See [async-component-testing](references/async-component-testing.md)
- Teleported modal content can't be found in wrapper queries → See [teleport-testing-complexity](references/teleport-testing-complexity.md)
- **Animation-Driven State**: If a store/component state change is delayed by a timeout (e.g., waiting for modal exit animation), use `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.advanceTimersByTime(...)` in Vitest to advance time. **MANDATORY**: Ensure the advance time EXCEEDS the code's timeout (e.g., use 600ms if the code has a 550ms timeout) to account for any race conditions in the test runner's event loop.
- **Logic Extraction for Testability**: Complex algorithms inside computed properties or methods in `.vue` files are hard to unit test. Extract core pure logic to external helper files (e.g., `mapCardHelper.js`) and test them in isolation using standard Vitest unit tests. This ensures the "brain" of the component is stable without the overhead of component mounting.
- **CLI Debug Tool Testing**: When unit testing CLI-first debug tools (in `debugStore.js`), you MUST mock the `DBRouter` or `supabase` layer to prevent real database interactions.
  - **Pattern**: Mock `rpc`, `upsert`, and `from().select()` chains to return predictable results.
  - **MANDATORY**: Ensure the mock handles `getTimeOffset` and `setTimeOffset` correctly if testing time-manipulation tools.
- **Robust Mocks for Combat Logic**: When unit testing complex combat turns (e.g., `battleTurn.js`) that interact with multiple Pinia stores and the GameBus, ensure the mock store provides a complete and consistent state. This includes nested properties (like `activeBattle.player.moves`) and all required base stats (`atk`, `def`, `maxHp`). Insufficient or shallow mocks often lead to silent failures or "property of undefined" errors during Vitest execution.
