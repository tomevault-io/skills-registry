# Phase 5 (Finalization) Validation Skill

**Purpose**: Automate validation that all work is properly documented, committed, and ready for deployment/handoff.

**When to Use**: Final validation before marking workflow complete.

## How to Use This Skill

**Executable Script**: `execute.sh`

```bash
# Basic usage (no parameters required)
bash .claude/skills/phase-5-validator/execute.sh

# Show help
bash .claude/skills/phase-5-validator/execute.sh --help
```

**Parameters**:
- No parameters required - validates current project state

**Script validates**:
- 🚨 BLOCKING: Single source of truth (no bash duplication in skills)
- 🚨 BLOCKING: Lessons learned file sizes (max 2,000 lines)
- Git & version control (commits, messages, branch status, conflicts)
- Documentation (file registry, PROGRESS.md, feature docs, CLAUDE.md)
- Lessons learned (new entries, format, cross-references)
- Deployment readiness (tests passing, no blocking issues, deployment notes)
- Cleanup (temp files, session work, orphaned files)

**Exit codes**:
- 0: Finalization complete, workflow can conclude
- 1: BLOCKING violations OR quality gates not met

**CRITICAL**: This validator has BLOCKING AUTHORITY and can prevent workflow completion.

## Quality Gate Checklist

### 🚨 Single Source of Truth (BLOCKING - Not Scored)
- [ ] **ALL skills validated for duplication** (MANDATORY)
- [ ] No bash command duplication in agent definitions
- [ ] No procedural duplication in lessons learned
- [ ] No automation duplication in process docs
- [ ] Skills properly referenced (not duplicated)

**CRITICAL**: This check runs FIRST with BLOCKING AUTHORITY.
**Any violations = immediate failure before scoring begins.**

---

### 🚨 Lessons File Sizes (BLOCKING - Not Scored)
- [ ] **ALL lessons files checked for size** (MANDATORY)
- [ ] No files exceeding 1700 line maximum
- [ ] Files approaching 90% threshold identified
- [ ] Multi-file structure properly maintained
- [ ] Size violations provide split instructions

**CRITICAL**: This check runs SECOND with BLOCKING AUTHORITY.
**Files exceeding 1700 lines = immediate failure before scoring begins.**

## Usage Examples

### From Orchestrator
```
Use the phase-5-validator skill to check if work is ready to finalize
```

### Manual Validation
```bash
# Run finalization validation
bash .claude/skills/phase-5-validator.md
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: File Registry Not Updated
**CRITICAL**: Every file operation must be logged.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Update file registry
echo "| $(date +%Y-%m-%d) | /path/to/file | CREATED | Purpose | Task | ACTIVE | - |" >> docs/architecture/file-registry.md
```

### Issue: Uncommitted Changes
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user management feature

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Issue: Missing Documentation
**Required documents**:
- business-requirements.md
- functional-spec.md
- database-design.md
- ui-ux-design.md
- implementation-notes.md
- deployment-notes.md

### Issue: Temporary Files
**Solution**:
```bash
# Find and remove
find . -name "*.tmp" -delete
find . -name "*.bak" -delete

# Or move to session-work
mkdir -p session-work/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
mv status.md session-work/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/
```

## Integration with Quality Gates

Quality gate thresholds by work type:

- **Feature**: 80% required
- **Bug Fix**: 75% required
- **Hotfix**: 70% required
- **Documentation**: 90% required
- **Refactoring**: 85% required

## Progressive Disclosure

**Initial Context**: Show quick status check (committed, documented, tested)
**On Request**: Show full scoring breakdown
**On Failure**: Show specific missing items with actionable fixes
**On Pass**: Show next steps and finalization instructions

---

**Remember**: Finalization is about ensuring nothing is forgotten. Documentation, commits, and lessons learned ensure the work is sustainable and maintainable long-term.
