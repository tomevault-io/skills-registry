# TEST_CATALOG Updater Skill

**Purpose**: Automate TEST_CATALOG updates after every test execution.

**When to Use**: After running any tests (unit, integration, or E2E).

## Critical Rule: TEST_CATALOG Must Be Updated

**MANDATORY**: Every test execution MUST update TEST_CATALOG.

**Why**: TEST_CATALOG is the single source of truth for:
- Which tests exist
- Test health status (passing/failing/flaky)
- Test metrics (count, coverage, execution time)
- Test transformation history

## TEST_CATALOG Structure

**Location**: `/docs/standards-processes/testing/TEST_CATALOG.md` (Part 1)

**Multi-File Structure**:
- **Part 1**: Navigation + Current tests (E2E, React, Backend)
- **Part 2**: Historical test transformations
- **Part 3**: Archived/obsolete tests

## Update Types

### 1. Execution Metrics Update
After running tests, update:
- Total tests executed
- Pass/fail counts
- Execution time
- Coverage percentage
- Last run timestamp

### 2. Status Change Update
When test status changes:
- PASSING → FAILING (with reason)
- FAILING → PASSING (resolution)
- STABLE → FLAKY (inconsistent results)

### 3. New Test Discovery
When new tests are added:
- Add test file to catalog
- Document test purpose
- Set initial status: NEW
- Link to feature/requirement

### 4. Test Removal/Archiving
When tests are deleted or obsoleted:
- Move to TEST_CATALOG_PART_3.md
- Document why removed
- Preserve transformation history

## How to Use This Skill

**Executable Script**: `execute.sh`

```bash
# Basic usage with required parameters
bash .claude/skills/test-catalog-updater/execute.sh \
  <test-type> \
  <passed> \
  <failed> \
  <total> \
  [execution-time] \
  [coverage]

# Example: Unit tests with all metrics
bash .claude/skills/test-catalog-updater/execute.sh unit 45 0 45 12.3 85

# Example: E2E tests (no coverage available)
bash .claude/skills/test-catalog-updater/execute.sh e2e 42 3 45 125.7 N/A

# Example: Integration tests passing
bash .claude/skills/test-catalog-updater/execute.sh integration 44 0 44 45.2 82
```

**Parameters**:
- `test-type`: Type of tests (unit | integration | e2e)
- `passed`: Number of tests that passed
- `failed`: Number of tests that failed
- `total`: Total number of tests
- `execution-time`: (optional) Total execution time in seconds
- `coverage`: (optional) Coverage percentage

**What the script does**:
1. Validates parameters (test type, numeric values)
2. Verifies TEST_CATALOG exists and is writable
3. Calculates pass rate and determines status (PASSING/PARTIAL/FAILING)
4. Creates backup of TEST_CATALOG
5. Updates metrics table in appropriate section
6. Updates "Last Updated" timestamp in catalog header
7. Appends failure details if tests failed
8. Reports summary with file locations

**Script includes parameter validation** - ensures correct usage and prevents invalid updates.

## Usage Examples

### From test-executor Agent (Automated)
```
After running tests, I'll use the test-catalog-updater skill to record the results.
```

### Manual Update
```bash
# After running unit tests
bash .claude/skills/test-catalog-updater.md \
  unit \
  45 \  # passed
  0 \   # failed
  45 \  # total
  12.3 \  # execution time (seconds)
  85    # coverage percentage
```

### From CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Extract test results and update catalog
PASSED=$(grep "Passed:" test-results.log | cut -d: -f2)
FAILED=$(grep "Failed:" test-results.log | cut -d: -f2)
TOTAL=$((PASSED + FAILED))

bash .claude/skills/test-catalog-updater.md \
  e2e \
  "$PASSED" \
  "$FAILED" \
  "$TOTAL" \
  "125.7" \
  "N/A"
```

## Metrics to Track

### Per Test Suite
| Metric | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Total Tests | Count of test methods/functions | Test runner output |
| Passed | Number passing | Test runner output |
| Failed | Number failing | Test runner output |
| Pass Rate | Percentage passing | Calculated |
| Execution Time | Total run time | Test runner output |
| Coverage | Code coverage % | Coverage tool output |
| Last Run | Timestamp of execution | System date |
| Status | PASSING/FAILING/FLAKY | Calculated |

### Aggregate Metrics
- Total tests across all suites
- Overall pass rate
- Total execution time
- Average coverage
- Flaky test count
- Tests added/removed this week

## Status Definitions

### PASSING ✅
- All tests passing
- No failures in last 3 runs
- Coverage meets or exceeds target

### FAILING ❌
- One or more tests failing
- Consistent failures
- Requires immediate attention

### FLAKY ⚠️
- Intermittent failures
- Passes sometimes, fails others
- Indicates unreliable test or race condition

### NEW 🆕
- Recently added test
- Not yet run in CI/CD
- Awaiting stability verification

### ARCHIVED 📦
- Test no longer active
- Moved to Part 3 of catalog
- Preserved for historical reference

## Catalog Format

```markdown
## Test Summary Metrics

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-04 14:30:00

### Overall Status
- **Total Tests**: 245
- **Passing**: 240 (98%)
- **Failing**: 5 (2%)
- **Flaky**: 3 (1%)

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

**Status**: ⚠️  PARTIAL (some failures)

| Status | Total | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate | Exec Time | Coverage | Last Run |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| ⚠️  PARTIAL | 45 | 42 | 3 | 93% | 125.3s | N/A | 2025-11-04 14:25 |

**Test Files**: 12 spec files in `/tests/playwright/`

**Known Issues**:
- Login flow test flaky (race condition)
- Admin dashboard timeout on slow machines
- Event registration occasionally times out

### Backend Unit Tests

**Status**: ✅ PASSING

| Status | Total | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate | Exec Time | Coverage | Last Run |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| ✅ PASSING | 156 | 156 | 0 | 100% | 12.4s | 87% | 2025-11-04 14:20 |

**Test Files**: 24 test classes in `/tests/WitchCityRope.Core.Tests/`

### Backend Integration Tests

**Status**: ✅ PASSING

| Status | Total | Passed | Failed | Pass Rate | Exec Time | Coverage | Last Run |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| ✅ PASSING | 44 | 44 | 0 | 100% | 45.2s | 82% | 2025-11-04 14:22 |

**Test Files**: 8 test classes in `/tests/WitchCityRope.IntegrationTests/`
```

## Integration with Phase 4 Validator

**phase-4-validator depends on TEST_CATALOG:**
- Reads current test status
- Validates 100% pass rate
- Checks for flaky tests
- Verifies coverage targets

**test-catalog-updater feeds phase-4-validator:**
- Provides real-time test metrics
- Documents test health trends
- Identifies problem areas
- Tracks improvements

## Failure Response Workflow

When TEST_CATALOG shows failures:

1. **test-executor documents failure in catalog**
   - Updates status to FAILING
   - Records error details
   - Notes timestamp

2. **Orchestrator reads catalog**
   - Sees FAILING status
   - Determines responsible agent
   - Delegates fix work

3. **Developer agent fixes issue**
   - Implements fix
   - Verifies locally

4. **test-executor re-runs tests**
   - Confirms fix works
   - Updates catalog to PASSING

5. **phase-4-validator confirms**
   - All tests passing
   - Ready for next phase

## Common Issues

### Issue: Catalog Not Updated
**Symptom**: Tests run but catalog shows old data
**Impact**: Orchestrator makes decisions on stale information
**Solution**: Enforce catalog update in test-executor agent definition

### Issue: Status Lag
**Symptom**: Test passes but catalog still shows FAILING
**Impact**: False negative blocks workflow
**Solution**: Update catalog immediately after test run, before reporting

### Issue: Missing Metrics
**Symptom**: Some columns empty or "N/A"
**Impact**: Incomplete tracking
**Solution**: Extract metrics from test runner output consistently

### Issue: Catalog Merge Conflicts
**Symptom**: Multiple agents update catalog simultaneously
**Impact**: Lost updates or conflicts
**Solution**: Sequential test execution, or use file locking

      "changed": false
    },
    "location": "/docs/standards-processes/testing/TEST_CATALOG.md",
    "section": "### Backend Unit Tests",
    "backup": "/docs/standards-processes/testing/TEST_CATALOG.md.backup"
  },
  "nextSteps": [
    "All tests passing - no action needed",
    "Coverage at 87% (target: 80%) - maintaining"
  ]
}
```

## Progressive Disclosure

**Initial Context**: Show test type and pass/fail summary
**On Request**: Show full metrics and catalog location
**On Failure**: Show failure details and required actions
**On Pass**: Show concise confirmation

**Remember**: TEST_CATALOG is the memory for test health. Without it, every test run starts from zero context. With it, trends emerge, problems surface early, and test quality continuously improves.
