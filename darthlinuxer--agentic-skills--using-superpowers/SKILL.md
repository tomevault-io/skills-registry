<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## How to Access Skills

**In this platform:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.

**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded. If you can't find any documentation, then try to use the `READ` tool on the skill file path to load it.

# Using Skills

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.

```dot
digraph skill_flow {
    "User message received" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Might any skill apply?" [shape=diamond];
    "Invoke Skill tool" [shape=box];
    "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'" [shape=box];
    "Has checklist?" [shape=diamond];
    "Create TodoWrite todo per item" [shape=box];
    "Follow skill exactly" [shape=box];
    "Respond (including clarifications)" [shape=doublecircle];

    "User message received" -> "Might any skill apply?";
    "Might any skill apply?" -> "Invoke Skill tool" [label="yes, even 1%"];
    "Might any skill apply?" -> "Respond (including clarifications)" [label="definitely not"];
    "Invoke Skill tool" -> "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'";
    "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'" -> "Has checklist?";
    "Has checklist?" -> "Create TodoWrite todo per item" [label="yes"];
    "Has checklist?" -> "Follow skill exactly" [label="no"];
    "Create TodoWrite todo per item" -> "Follow skill exactly";
}
```

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |

## Implementation Decision Tree

When user asks you to implement something, follow this decision tree:

```dot
digraph implementation_routing {
    rankdir=TB;
    "User requests implementation" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Multi-component/file?\n>30 min work?\n>5 distinct steps?" [shape=diamond];
    "Single feature/bugfix\nneeding code changes?" [shape=diamond];
    "Use writing-plans\n→ subagent-driven-development" [shape=box style=filled fillcolor=lightblue];
    "Use test-driven-development\n(which uses senior-software-developer patterns)" [shape=box style=filled fillcolor=lightgreen];
    "Use senior-software-developer\ndirectly" [shape=box style=filled fillcolor=lightyellow];

    "User requests implementation" -> "Multi-component/file?\n>30 min work?\n>5 distinct steps?";
    "Multi-component/file?\n>30 min work?\n>5 distinct steps?" -> "Use writing-plans\n→ subagent-driven-development" [label="YES"];
    "Multi-component/file?\n>30 min work?\n>5 distinct steps?" -> "Single feature/bugfix\nneeding code changes?" [label="NO"];
    "Single feature/bugfix\nneeding code changes?" -> "Use test-driven-development\n(which uses senior-software-developer patterns)" [label="YES"];
    "Single feature/bugfix\nneeding code changes?" -> "Use senior-software-developer\ndirectly" [label="NO\n(refactor/architecture only)"];
}
```

**Complexity thresholds:**

**Simple → Use `test-driven-development`:**
- Single function/class/module
- <30 minutes estimated work
- <5 distinct implementation steps
- Example: "Add input validation to login form"

**Complex → Use `writing-plans` → `subagent-driven-development`:**
- Multiple files/components
- >30 minutes estimated work
- >5 distinct implementation steps
- Requires architectural decisions
- Example: "Build user authentication system with JWT, refresh tokens, and role-based access"

**Architecture/Refactor → Use `senior-software-developer` directly:**
- No new features, only restructuring
- Requires senior-level judgment on patterns
- Example: "Refactor payment processing to use Strategy pattern"

**Key relationships:**
- `test-driven-development` is the default methodology for feature implementation
- `test-driven-development` uses `senior-software-developer` patterns for code quality
- `subagent-driven-development` uses both `test-driven-development` and `senior-software-developer`
- `senior-software-developer` is a pattern library, not invoked directly for new features

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** (use decision tree above) - these guide execution

"Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation decision tree.
"Fix this bug" → debugging first, then test-driven-development.

## Available Skills Catalog

### Development & Implementation

- **senior-software-developer**: Production-quality patterns, standards, and language-specific best practices for Python, C#, Node.js, TypeScript
- **writing-plans**: Create comprehensive implementation plans for complex, multi-component tasks (>30 min, multiple files/modules)
- **subagent-driven-development**: Execute implementation plans by dispatching fresh subagents per task with two-stage review
- **verification-before-completion**: Use when about to claim work is complete - requires running verification commands and confirming output before any success claims

**PM Routing:**
```dot
digraph pm_routing {

    "PM request" -> "Methodology?";
    "Methodology?" -> "PMBOK/Waterfall" [label="PMBOK 7\nWaterfall\nPredictive\nGovernance"];
    "PMBOK/Waterfall" -> "Use senior-pmbok-pm";
    "Methodology?" -> "Agile/Scrum" [label="Scrum\nSprints\nUser Stories\nBudget Analysis"];
    "Agile/Scrum" -> "Use senior-agile-pm-budget-analyst";
}
```

**Triggers:**
- **senior-pmbok-pm**: "PMBOK", "waterfall", "predictive", "TAP", "termo de abertura", "governance", "compliance", "formal project management"
- **senior-agile-pm-budget-analyst**: "Scrum", "sprint", "user story", "poker planning", "BDD", "agile", "budget analysis", "story points", "velocity"

### Specialized Tools
- **mcp-builder**: Guide for creating high-quality MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for LLM integration with external services

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
