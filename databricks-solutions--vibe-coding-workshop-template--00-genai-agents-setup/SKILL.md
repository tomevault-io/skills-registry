# GenAI Agent Implementation Orchestrator

End-to-end guide for implementing production-grade Databricks GenAI agents using the MLflow 3.0 ResponsesAgent framework with Genie Spaces, Lakebase memory, and comprehensive evaluation.

## When to Use

- Implementing a new AI agent on Databricks from scratch
- Creating multi-agent systems with Genie Space data access
- Setting up agent evaluation pipelines with LLM judges
- Deploying agents to Model Serving with OBO authentication
- Adding memory (short-term conversations, long-term preferences) to agents
- Troubleshooting agent implementation errors (AI Playground, authentication, evaluation)
- Planning agent architecture (orchestrator + worker pattern)

## Architecture Overview

### Recommended: Hybrid Architecture (Genie + Custom Orchestrator)

## Working Memory Management

This orchestrator spans 9 phases (Phase 0-8) — one of the longest in the pipeline. To maintain coherence without context pollution:

**After each phase, persist a brief summary note** capturing:
- **Phase 0 output:** Manifest found (yes/no), agent count, Genie Space IDs from manifest, tool definitions
- **Phase 1 output:** ResponsesAgent class path, tracing config, base agent working
- **Phase 2 output:** Genie Space tool IDs, data access verified, query routing decisions
- **Phase 3 output:** Lakebase table names (conversations, preferences), memory config
- **Phase 4 output:** Prompt template paths, system prompt derivation from Genie Space instructions
- **Phase 5 output:** Evaluation dataset table path, scorer names, baseline metrics
- **Phase 6 output:** Model Serving endpoint name, OBO auth config, deployment job paths
- **Phase 7 output:** Production monitor names, alert thresholds, drift detection config
- **Phase 8 output:** Genie Space optimization results, benchmark accuracy improvements

**What to keep in working memory:** Only the current phase's context, the agent inventory (from Phase 0), and the previous phase's summary note. Discard intermediate outputs (full evaluation DataFrames, raw trace logs, complete prompt texts) — they are in MLflow and on disk.

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Read Plan (5 minutes)

**Before starting implementation, check for a planning manifest that defines what to build.**

```python
import yaml
from pathlib import Path

manifest_path = Path("plans/manifests/genai-agents-manifest.yaml")

if manifest_path.exists():
    with open(manifest_path) as f:
        manifest = yaml.safe_load(f)
    
    # Extract implementation checklist from manifest
    architecture = manifest.get('architecture', {})
    agents = manifest.get('agents', [])
    evaluation = manifest.get('evaluation', {})
    prompts = manifest.get('prompts', [])
    deployment = manifest.get('deployment', {})
    print(f"Plan: {len(agents)} agents, {len(prompts)} prompts")
    print(f"Architecture: {architecture.get('pattern', 'unknown')}")
    
    # Each agent has: name, domain, genie_space, capabilities, tools, sample_questions
    # Evaluation has: dataset_table, questions_per_domain, scorers, thresholds
else:
    # Fallback: self-discovery from Genie Spaces
    print("No manifest found — falling back to Genie Space self-discovery")
    # Discover existing Genie Spaces, create one agent per space
```

**If manifest exists:** Use it as the implementation checklist. Every agent, tool, evaluation question, and deployment configuration is pre-defined. Track completion against the manifest's `summary` counts.

**If manifest doesn't exist:** Fall back to self-discovery — inventory existing Genie Spaces from the catalog, create one agent per Genie Space, and use default evaluation criteria. This works but may miss specific tool definitions and cross-domain orchestration patterns the planning phase would have defined.

### Phase 1: Foundation (ResponsesAgent + Tracing)

**Load skill:** `responses-agent-patterns`

**Goal:** Create a working ResponsesAgent with MLflow tracing that loads in AI Playground.

**Artifacts produced:**
- Agent class inheriting from `ResponsesAgent`
- `predict()` and `predict_stream()` methods

- OBO authentication with context detection

**Validate before proceeding:**
- [ ] Agent loads in AI Playground without errors

- [ ] 4-6 guidelines (not 8+)
- [ ] Metric aliases defined for backward compatibility

### Phase 6: Deployment

**Load skill:** `deployment-automation`

**Goal:** Automated deployment pipeline triggered by model version creation.

**Artifacts produced:**
- Deployment job YAML (Asset Bundle)

- [ ] Trace archival enabled
- [ ] Dashboard queries return metrics

### Phase 8: Genie Optimization

- [ ] Arrays sorted before API updates
- [ ] Rate limiting in place (12+ seconds)

## Critical Anti-Patterns (NEVER Do These)

For the complete anti-patterns reference, see `references/anti-patterns.md`.

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence | Correct Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Manual `signature` in `log_model()` | Breaks AI Playground | Let MLflow auto-infer |
| LLM fallback for data queries | Hallucinated fake data | Return explicit error messages |
| OBO in non-serving contexts | Permission errors | Context detection with env vars |
| Missing `_extract_response_text()` | All scorer scores = 0.0 | Universal extraction helper |
| `langchain_databricks` in scorers | Serverless failures | Databricks SDK |
| 8+ guidelines sections | Score = 0.20 | 4-6 focused guidelines |
| Missing metric aliases | Silent threshold bypass | Define aliases for MLflow versions |
| `scorer.start()` without assignment | Scorers don't start | `scorer = scorer.start()` |
| API-only Genie updates | Lost on redeployment | Dual persistence (API + repo) |
| Unsorted Genie API arrays | API rejection | Sort all arrays before PATCH |

### Upstream Agent Bricks (databricks-agent-bricks)

This skill extends the upstream `databricks-agent-bricks` skill from ai-dev-kit. The following capabilities are available.

#### Agent Types in Supervisor Agents (MAS)

The upstream `databricks-agent-bricks` skill supports 5 agent types in Supervisor Agents:

| Agent Type | Parameter | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Knowledge Assistant | `ka_tile_id` | Document Q&A via RAG from PDFs in Volumes |
| Genie Space | `genie_space_id` | Natural language to SQL |
| Custom Endpoint | `endpoint_name` | Model serving endpoint for custom agents |
| UC Function | `uc_function_name` | Unity Catalog function (format: `catalog.schema.function_name`). Agent service principal needs `EXECUTE` privilege. |
| External MCP Server | `connection_name` | UC HTTP Connection with `is_mcp_connection: 'true'`. Agent service principal needs `USE CONNECTION` privilege. |

Provide exactly one of: `ka_tile_id`, `genie_space_id`, `endpoint_name`, `uc_function_name`, or `connection_name` per agent.

#### New Actions

- `find_by_name` action for both `manage_ka` and `manage_mas` tools — looks up an existing KA or Supervisor Agent by name when you don't have the tile_id

#### MCP Tools

- `manage_ka`: Manage Knowledge Assistants (create_or_update, get, find_by_name, delete)
- `manage_mas`: Manage Supervisor Agents (create_or_update, get, find_by_name, delete)

## Pipeline Progression

**Previous stage:** `ml/00-ml-pipeline-setup` → ML models and experiments should be set up

**This is the final stage** in the standard pipeline progression. After completing GenAI agent implementation, the data platform is fully operational with:
- Bronze → Silver → Gold data pipeline
- Semantic layer (Metric Views, TVFs, Genie Spaces)
- Observability (Monitoring, Dashboards, Alerts)
- ML models and experiments
- GenAI agents with evaluation and deployment
