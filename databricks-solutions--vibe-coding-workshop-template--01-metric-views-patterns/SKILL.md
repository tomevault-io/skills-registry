# Metric Views Patterns for Genie & AI/BI

## Overview

Metric Views provide a semantic layer for natural language queries via Genie and AI/BI dashboards. This skill standardizes the YAML structure for comprehensive, LLM-friendly metric definitions following Databricks Metric View Specification v1.1.

**Predecessor:** Gold tables must exist before creating metric views. Use `gold-layer-design` + `gold-layer-setup` skills first.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Create metric views with proper SQL syntax (`WITH METRICS LANGUAGE YAML`)
- Validate schemas before deployment to prevent 100% of common errors
- Structure joins (direct and snowflake schema patterns)
- Optimize comments for Genie natural language queries
- Handle SCD2 dimensions with proper `is_current` filtering

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating new metric views for Genie Spaces
- Troubleshooting metric view creation errors
- Validating schema references before deployment
- Implementing joins (including transitive relationships)
- Optimizing metric views for Genie natural language queries
- Ensuring compliance with v1.1 specification
- Following the requirements gathering template to design metric views

## Prerequisites

⚠️ **MANDATORY:** Complete these before creating metric views:
- [ ] Gold layer tables exist in Unity Catalog (use `gold-layer-design` + `gold-layer-setup` skills)
- [ ] Gold layer YAML schemas exist in `gold_layer_design/yaml/` (for validation script)
- [ ] Serverless SQL warehouse available (for metric view creation and querying)
- [ ] Databricks Runtime 17.2+ (required for YAML version 1.1)

## MCP Tools (from upstream databricks-metric-views)

The `manage_metric_views` MCP tool supports all metric view operations:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `create` | Create a metric view with dimensions and measures |
| `alter` | Update a metric view's YAML definition |
| `describe` | Get the full definition and metadata |
| `query` | Query measures grouped by dimensions |
| `drop` | Drop a metric view |
| `grant` | Grant SELECT privileges to users/groups |

## Quick Start (2 hours)

**What You'll Create:**
1. `metric_views/{view_name}.yaml` — Semantic definitions (dimensions, measures, joins, formats)
2. `create_metric_views.py` — Script reads YAML, creates views with `WITH METRICS LANGUAGE YAML`
3. `metric_views_job.yml` — Asset Bundle job for deployment

**Deploy:** `databricks bundle deploy -t dev && databricks bundle run metric_views_job -t dev`

## Critical Rules

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Correct SQL Syntax

**Metric views MUST be created using `WITH METRICS LANGUAGE YAML` syntax:**

```python
create_sql = f"""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW {fully_qualified_name}
WITH METRICS
LANGUAGE YAML
COMMENT '{view_comment_escaped}'
AS $$
{yaml_str}
$$
"""
```

**Key Requirements:**
1. `WITH METRICS` — Identifies the view as a metric view
2. `LANGUAGE YAML` — Specifies YAML format
3. `AS $$ ... $$` — YAML content wrapped in dollar-quote delimiters
4. No SELECT statement — The YAML definition IS the view definition
5. `version` field — Must be included in each metric view YAML

**❌ WRONG:** Regular view with TBLPROPERTIES (creates regular VIEW, not METRIC_VIEW)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: v1.1 Unsupported Fields

**These fields will cause errors and MUST NOT be used:**

| Field | Error | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `name` | `Unrecognized field "name"` | ❌ NEVER include — name is in CREATE VIEW statement |
| `time_dimension` | `Unrecognized field "time_dimension"` | ❌ Remove entirely |
| `window_measures` | `Unrecognized field "window_measures"` | ❌ Remove top-level `window_measures:` array. Individual measure `window:` property is Experimental (v0.1 only, DBR 16.4-17.1). See `references/composability-patterns.md` for details. |
| `join_type` | Unsupported | ❌ Remove — defaults to LEFT OUTER JOIN |
| `table` (in joins) | `Missing required creator property 'source'` | ✅ Use `source` instead |

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Pre-Creation Schema Validation

**ALWAYS validate schemas BEFORE creating metric view YAML. 100% of deployment failures are preventable schema issues.**

**Schema Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Verified source table schema (ran DESCRIBE TABLE or checked YAML)
- [ ] Verified all joined table schemas
- [ ] Created column reference checklist for all tables
- [ ] Validated every dimension `expr` column exists
- [ ] Validated every measure `expr` column exists
- [ ] Validated join key columns exist in both tables
- [ ] Verified no transitive joins (all joins are source → table)
- [ ] For COUNT measures, verified primary key column exists
- [ ] For SCD2 joins, verified `is_current` column exists

See `references/validation-checklist.md` for detailed validation steps.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Source Table Selection

**Rule:** Revenue/bookings/transactions → FACT table. Property/host counts → DIMENSION table.

**❌ WRONG:** Revenue from dimension table (under-reports by 4x)
```yaml
source: ${catalog}.${schema}.dim_property  # ❌ Wrong for revenue!
```

**✅ CORRECT:** Revenue from fact table
```yaml
source: ${catalog}.${schema}.fact_booking_daily  # ✅ Correct for revenue!
```

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Transitive Join Limitations

**Metric Views DO NOT support transitive/chained joins** (where join B's `on` clause references join A instead of `source`).

**How to detect:** If ANY join's `on` clause references a join alias (not `source`), it is transitive and will fail.

**❌ WRONG:** Transitive join (join B references join A)
```yaml
joins:
  - name: dim_property                              # Join A
    source: catalog.schema.dim_property
    'on': source.property_id = dim_property.property_id
  - name: dim_destination                            # Join B
    source: catalog.schema.dim_destination
    'on': dim_property.destination_id = dim_destination.destination_id  # ❌ References dim_property!
```

**✅ FIX 1 (Preferred — simplest): Use denormalized columns from existing dimension**

If `dim_property` already has `destination_name` and `destination_country`, reference them directly — no second join needed:
```yaml
dimensions:
  - name: destination_name
    expr: dim_property.destination_name  # ✅ Already in dim_property
  - name: destination_country
    expr: dim_property.destination_country
```

**✅ FIX 2: Snowflake schema (nested joins) — requires DBR 17.1+**
```yaml
joins:
  - name: dim_property
    source: catalog.schema.dim_property
    'on': source.property_id = dim_property.property_id
    joins:  # ✅ Nested under dim_property — snowflake schema
      - name: dim_destination
        source: catalog.schema.dim_destination
        'on': dim_property.destination_id = dim_destination.destination_id
```

**Validation gate:** Before generating YAML, inspect all join `on` clauses. If the left side of any `on` references a join name (not `source`), restructure as nested joins or use denormalized columns.

See `references/advanced-patterns.md` for additional snowflake schema examples.

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Design (30 min)

**Read:** `references/requirements-template.md`

- [ ] Identify fact table as primary source
- [ ] List dimensions to join (2-5 dimension tables)
- [ ] Define key measures (5-10 measures with aggregation type)
- [ ] List common user questions (guides synonym creation)
- [ ] Map synonyms for each dimension and measure (3-5 each)

### Phase 2: YAML Creation (1 hour)

**Read:** `references/yaml-reference.md` and `references/advanced-patterns.md`

- [ ] Create one YAML file per metric view (filename = view name)
- [ ] Define `source` table (fully qualified with `${catalog}` and `${gold_schema}` placeholders)
- [ ] Add `joins` with `name`, `source`, `'on'` (include `is_current = true` for SCD2)
- [ ] Define dimensions with correct prefix (`source.` or `{join_name}.`)
  - [ ] Business-friendly comments and display names
  - [ ] 3-10 synonyms each (max 10 per field, max 255 chars each)
- [ ] Define measures with correct aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
  - [ ] Proper formatting (currency, number, percentage)
  - [ ] Comprehensive comments for Genie
  - [ ] 3-10 synonyms each (max 10 per field, max 255 chars each)

### Phase 3: Script & Bundle (30 min)

**Read:** `references/implementation-workflow.md`

- [ ] Validate YAML with `scripts/validate_metric_view.py`
- [ ] Use `scripts/create_metric_views.py` for deployment
- [ ] Configure Asset Bundle job (see `assets/templates/metric-views-job-template.yml`)
- [ ] Add YAML file sync to `databricks.yml`

### Phase 4: Deploy & Test (30 min)

**Read:** `references/validation-queries.md`

- [ ] Deploy: `databricks bundle deploy -t dev`
- [ ] Run: `databricks bundle run metric_views_job -t dev`
- [ ] Verify: `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` shows Type: METRIC_VIEW
- [ ] Test: `SELECT ... MEASURE(\`Total Revenue\`) ... GROUP BY ...`
- [ ] Test with Genie: Ask natural language questions

## Quick Reference

### YAML Structure (v1.1)

```yaml
version: "1.1"
comment: >
  PURPOSE: [One-line description]
  BEST FOR: [Question 1] | [Question 2] | [Question 3]
  NOT FOR: [What to avoid] (use [correct_asset] instead)
  DIMENSIONS: [dim1], [dim2], [dim3]
  MEASURES: [measure1], [measure2], [measure3]
  SOURCE: [fact_table] ([domain] domain)
  JOINS: [dim_table1] ([description])
  NOTE: [Critical caveats]

source: ${catalog}.${gold_schema}.<fact_table>
filter: <sql_boolean_expression>  # Optional: WHERE clause applied to all queries

joins:
  - name: <dim_table_alias>
    source: ${catalog}.${gold_schema}.<dim_table>
    'on': source.<fk> = <dim_table_alias>.<pk> AND <dim_table_alias>.is_current = true

dimensions:
  - name: <dimension_name>
    expr: source.<column>
    comment: <Business description>
    display_name: <User-Friendly Name>
    synonyms: [<alt1>, <alt2>]

measures:
  - name: <measure_name>
    expr: SUM(source.<column>)
    comment: <Business description>
    display_name: <User-Friendly Name>
    format:
      type: currency|number|percentage
      currency_code: USD
      decimal_places:
        type: exact|all
        places: 2
    synonyms: [<alt1>, <alt2>]
```

**Valid format types (exhaustive):**

| Type | Use For | Common Mistake |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `byte` | Data sizes (storage, memory) | — |
| `currency` | Monetary values (revenue, cost) | — |
| `date` | Date-only values | — |
| `date_time` | Timestamp values | — |
| `number` | Counts, averages, decimals, integers | ❌ `decimal`, ❌ `integer` |
| `percentage` | Ratios, rates, percentages | ❌ `percent` |

**⚠️ `percent` is NOT valid** (use `percentage`). **`decimal` is NOT valid** (use `number`).

### Column References

- **Main table columns:** Use `source.` prefix in all `expr` fields
- **Joined table columns:** Use join `name` as prefix (e.g., `dim_store.column_name`)
- **Never reference table names directly:** Use `source.` or `{join_name}.`

### Join Requirements

- Each join **MUST have** `name`, `source`, and either `'on'` or `using`
- `ON` clause: boolean expression using `source.` for main table, join name for joined table (quote the key: `'on'`)
- `USING` clause: array of column names shared between source and join table
- Each first-level join must reference `source` (NOT another join alias — that's transitive)
- For transitive relationships, use nested `joins:` (snowflake schema, DBR 17.1+) or denormalized columns
- SCD2 joins must include `AND {dim_table}.is_current = true`
- **MAP type columns are NOT supported** in joined tables

## Core Patterns

### Composability (MEASURE Function)

Metric views support **composability** — building complex metrics by referencing simpler measures via the `MEASURE()` function. Define atomic measures first, then compose derived KPIs:

```yaml
measures:
  - name: total_revenue
    expr: SUM(source.net_revenue)
  - name: order_count
    expr: COUNT(source.order_id)
  - name: avg_order_value
    expr: MEASURE(total_revenue) / MEASURE(order_count)  # ✅ Composed measure
```

**Measure-level filtering** with `FILTER` clause:
```yaml
  - name: fulfilled_orders
    expr: COUNT(1) FILTER (WHERE source.order_status = 'F')
  - name: fulfillment_rate
    expr: MEASURE(fulfilled_orders) / MEASURE(order_count)
    format:
      type: percentage
```

**Best practices:** Define atomic measures (SUM, COUNT, AVG) first; always use `MEASURE()` to reference other measures (never repeat the aggregation logic).

See `references/composability-patterns.md` for full guide including conditional logic, window measures (Experimental), and complete examples.

### Standardized Comment Format (v3.0)

Use structured format for Genie optimization:

```yaml
comment: >
  PURPOSE: Comprehensive cost analytics for Databricks billing and usage analysis.
  
  BEST FOR: Total spend by workspace | Cost trend over time | SKU cost breakdown
  
  NOT FOR: Commit/contract tracking (use commit_tracking) | Real-time cost alerts
  
  DIMENSIONS: usage_date, workspace_name, sku_name, owner, tag_team
  
  MEASURES: total_cost, total_dbus, cost_7d, cost_30d
  
  SOURCE: fact_usage (billing domain)
  
  JOINS: dim_workspace (workspace details), dim_sku (SKU details)
  
  NOTE: Cost values are list prices. Actual billed amounts may differ.
```

### Dimension & Measure Patterns

See `references/advanced-patterns.md` for complete dimension patterns (geographic, product, time), measure patterns (revenue, count, percentage), and a full worked retail example.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Top 5 mistakes (with paired wrong/correct examples): wrong syntax (TBLPROPERTIES), unsupported fields (`time_dimension`, `window_measures`), wrong column references, including `name` in YAML, transitive joins.

See `references/advanced-patterns.md` for detailed wrong/correct code examples for each mistake.

## Python Script Error Handling

Key rules: strip `name` before `yaml.dump()`, drop existing VIEW/TABLE before CREATE, track failures and raise `RuntimeError`, verify METRIC_VIEW type via `DESCRIBE EXTENDED`.

See `scripts/create_metric_views.py` for the full working script and `references/implementation-workflow.md` for the detailed error handling patterns.

## Time Estimates

| Metric Views | Design | YAML Creation | Deploy & Test | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 view | 20 min | 30 min | 20 min | ~1 hour |
| 2-3 views | 30 min | 1 hour | 30 min | ~2 hours |
| 5+ views | 1 hour | 2 hours | 30 min | ~3.5 hours |

## Materialization (Experimental)

Metric views support optional materialization for pre-computed aggregations. Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines orchestrates materialized views, and the query optimizer automatically routes queries to the best materialized view using aggregate-aware query rewriting.

```yaml
materialization:
  schedule: every 6 hours
  mode: relaxed
  materialized_views:
    - name: baseline
      type: unaggregated
    - name: revenue_breakdown
      type: aggregated
      dimensions: [category, color]
      measures: [total_revenue]
```

**Materialized view types:** `unaggregated` (full data) and `aggregated` (pre-computed for specific dimension/measure combinations). Check refresh status with `DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED`.

Requires serverless compute enabled. Currently experimental — use for high-query-volume metric views where pre-computation reduces latency.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `SELECT *` not supported | Must explicitly list dimensions and use `MEASURE()` for measures |
| "Cannot resolve column" | Dimension/measure names with spaces need backtick quoting |
| JOIN at query time fails | Joins must be in the YAML definition, not in the SELECT query |
| `MEASURE()` required | All measure references must be wrapped: `MEASURE(\`name\`)` |
| DBR version error | Requires Runtime 17.2+ for YAML v1.1, or 16.4+ for v0.1 |
| Materialization not working | Requires serverless compute enabled; currently experimental |

## Metric Views Notes to Carry Forward

After completing metric view creation, carry these notes to the next worker:
- **Metric View names and paths:** List of all created MVs with YAML file paths
- **Grain per view:** Which fact table sources each MV
- **Measure counts:** Number of dimensions and measures per MV
- **Validation status:** Which MVs passed schema validation, any unresolved issues
- **Composability notes:** Any composed measures using MEASURE() that downstream workers should know about

## Next Step

After metric views are deployed and validated, proceed to:
**`semantic-layer/02-databricks-table-valued-functions/SKILL.md`** — Create TVFs for Genie Spaces using the Gold tables referenced by your metric views.
