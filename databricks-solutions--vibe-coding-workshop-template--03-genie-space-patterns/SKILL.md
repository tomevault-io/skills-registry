# Genie Space Patterns

## Overview

This skill provides patterns for setting up production-ready Databricks Genie Spaces with natural language analytics capabilities. The quality of Genie responses directly correlates with the depth of business context provided in agent instructions.

**Core Principle:** Business context drives AI quality. Comprehensive agent instructions, properly selected data assets, and validated benchmark questions ensure reliable Genie performance.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating new Genie Spaces for natural language analytics
- Configuring agent behavior and instructions
- Selecting and organizing data assets (Metric Views, TVFs, Tables)
- Writing benchmark questions for validation
- Troubleshooting Genie query routing issues
- Optimizing Genie Space performance

### 🔀 Hand Off to `genie-space-export-import-api` Skill When:

| User Says / Task Involves | Load Instead |
|---|---|
| "deploy Genie Space via API" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |
| "export Genie Space", "download Genie Space config" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |
| "import Genie Space", "restore Genie Space" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |
| "CI/CD for Genie Spaces" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |
| "migrate Genie Space to another workspace" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |
| "back up Genie Space configuration" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |
| "programmatically create Genie Space from JSON" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |
| "`serialized_space`", "REST API", "`/api/2.0/genie/spaces`" | `genie-space-export-import-api` |

**This skill** covers *what* goes into a Genie Space (instructions, assets, benchmarks).
The **export/import API skill** covers *how* to deploy it programmatically.

## Upstream: Genie API Updates

The upstream `databricks-genie` skill provides these MCP tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_genie` | List all Genie Spaces accessible to you |
| `create_or_update_genie` | Create or update a Genie Space |
| `get_genie` | Get Genie Space details |
| `delete_genie` | Delete a Genie Space |
| `find_genie_by_name` | Look up a Genie Space by name (when you don't have the space_id) |
| `ask_genie` | Ask a question to a Genie Space, get SQL + results |
| `ask_genie_followup` | Ask follow-up question in existing conversation |

**IMPORTANT:** There is NO system table for Genie spaces (e.g., `system.ai.genie_spaces` does NOT exist). To find a Genie space by name, use the `find_genie_by_name` tool.

---

## Critical Rules

### 1. General Instructions Must Be ≤20 Lines

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Genie processes General Instructions effectively only when ≤20 lines. Longer instructions get truncated or ignored.

**✅ DO:** Keep General Instructions concise and focused on essential routing rules.

**❌ DON'T:** Exceed 20 lines in General Instructions section.

### 2. Benchmark Questions Must Have Working SQL

**Every benchmark question MUST include copy-paste-ready SQL that actually runs.**

**✅ DO:** Include tested SQL with every benchmark question.

**❌ DON'T:** Provide questions without SQL or untested SQL.

### 3. MEASURE() Uses Column Names, NOT Display Names

**The MEASURE() function requires actual column `name`, NOT `display_name`.**

**❌ WRONG:**
```sql
MEASURE(`Total Revenue`)  -- ❌ FAILS: "Total Revenue" is display_name
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```sql
MEASURE(total_revenue)  -- ✅ Uses actual column name from YAML
```

### 4. Full UC 3-Part Namespace Required

**All table and function references MUST use full Unity Catalog namespace.**

**❌ WRONG:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM fact_sales;
SELECT * FROM get_revenue_by_period('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31', 'week');
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM ${catalog}.${gold_schema}.fact_sales;
SELECT * FROM ${catalog}.${gold_schema}.get_revenue_by_period('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31', 'week');
```

### 5. Data Asset Hierarchy: Metric Views → TVFs → Tables

**Always add assets in this order:**

1. **Metric Views** (Primary - use first)
   - Pre-aggregated, optimized, rich semantics
   - Best for broad analytical queries

2. **TVFs** (Secondary - use for specific patterns)
   - Parameterized queries, business logic
   - Date-bounded queries, top N rankings

3. **Tables** (Last resort - use sparingly)
   - Only when metric views/TVFs insufficient
   - Reference data, ad-hoc exploration

### 6. Avoid Contradictory Routing Rules

**Issue:** Contradictory rules cause Genie to randomly select wrong assets.

**✅ DO:** Group by question type, not asset
```markdown
Revenue/booking questions:
  - By property → revenue_analytics_metrics
  - By host → get_host_performance TVF (not metric view!)
```

**❌ DON'T:** Create conflicting asset mappings
```markdown
- host_analytics_metrics → for host data
- get_host_performance → for host data  # ❌ CONFLICT!
```

### 7. Define Ambiguous Terms Explicitly

**Common ambiguous terms:** "underperforming", "top performing", "valuable customers", "best hosts"

**✅ DO:** Add explicit definitions
```markdown
## Term Definitions
"underperforming" = properties with revenue below median (use get_underperforming_properties TVF)
"top performing" = highest revenue unless "rated" specified
```

### 8. TVF Syntax Rules

**Common errors to prevent:**

**❌ WRONG:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE(get_customer_segments(...))  -- ❌ Don't wrap in TABLE()
SELECT * FROM get_customer_segments()            -- ❌ Missing parameters
SELECT * FROM get_customer_segments(...) GROUP BY segment  -- ❌ Unnecessary GROUP BY
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_customer_segments('2020-01-01', '2024-12-31')  -- ✅ Direct call with params
```

### 9. 🔴 MANDATORY: Serverless SQL Warehouse Only

**ALWAYS assign a Serverless SQL Warehouse to Genie Spaces. NEVER use Classic or Pro warehouses.**

Serverless provides auto-scaling, instant startup, and cost-efficient idle timedowns -- critical for interactive Genie sessions where users expect sub-10-second responses.

**❌ WRONG:** Classic SQL warehouse with manual cluster sizing.

**✅ CORRECT:** Serverless SQL warehouse (auto-detected or explicitly set).

### 10. Table/Column COMMENTs Are Genie Fuel

**Genie uses Unity Catalog TABLE and COLUMN comments to understand data.** Missing comments = degraded SQL generation quality.

**🔴 MANDATORY:** Before adding ANY table as a trusted asset, verify it has:
- `COMMENT ON TABLE` with a business-friendly description
- `COMMENT ON COLUMN` for every column, including dimension values and business context

See [Table Documentation Skill](../../gold/design-workers/06-table-documentation/SKILL.md) for comment standards.

**❌ WRONG:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (sale_id BIGINT, amt DECIMAL(18,2));  -- No comments, cryptic names
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (
  sale_id BIGINT COMMENT 'Unique sale identifier from POS system',
  total_amount DECIMAL(18,2) COMMENT 'Net sale amount in USD after discounts'
) COMMENT 'Daily retail sales transactions at store-SKU grain';
```

### 11. Pre-Creation Table Inspection Is Mandatory

**Before creating a Genie Space, ALWAYS inspect target table schemas.** Do not rely on assumed schemas.

1. Run `DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED` or use `get_table_details` for each trusted asset
2. Verify all tables have TABLE and COLUMN comments
3. Verify descriptive column names (use `customer_lifetime_value` NOT `clv`)
4. Verify proper data types (DATE columns for time-based queries)

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#pre-creation-table-inspection) for the full inspection checklist.

### 12. Prompt User for Benchmark Questions Before Generating

**Always ask the user for benchmark questions before generating synthetic ones.** User-provided questions reflect real business needs and catch domain-specific edge cases that synthetic generation misses.

**Three outcomes:**
- **User provides 10+:** Validate each one. Report any that can't be answered (missing table, ambiguous terms). Proceed with valid set.
- **User provides 1-9:** Validate provided, report issues, augment with synthetic to reach 10-15 total. Show augmentation to user.
- **User provides none:** Generate 10-15 synthetic benchmarks from asset metadata. Show to user for review.

**If a user question can't be answered**, do NOT silently drop it. Inform the user with the specific reason:
- "Table `X` is not a trusted asset in this space"
- "No data available for churn analysis — available domains are: revenue, bookings, property performance"
- "Term 'underperforming' is ambiguous — how should it be defined?"

See [Benchmark Intake Workflow](references/benchmark-intake-workflow.md) for the full validation and generation pipeline.

### 13. Validate Programmatically via Conversation API

**After deployment, test benchmark questions programmatically using the Conversation API -- not just the UI.**

```python
# ✅ Programmatic validation (reproducible, automated)
result = ask_genie(space_id="your_space_id", question="What were total sales last month?")
assert result["status"] == "COMPLETED"
assert result["row_count"] > 0
```

**Key rules:**
- Start a NEW conversation for each unrelated benchmark question
- Use `ask_genie_followup` ONLY for related follow-up questions within the same topic
- Set timeouts: simple queries (30s), complex joins (60-120s), large scans (120s+)

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#conversation-api-validation) for full testing patterns.

## Quick Reference

### Mandatory 7-Section Structure

Every Genie Space setup MUST produce a document with ALL 7 sections:

| Section | Requirement | Key Constraint |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **A. Space Name** | `{Project} {Domain} Analytics Space` | Exact format |
| **B. Space Description** | 2-3 sentences | Business context |
| **C. Sample Questions** | 10-15 questions | Grouped by domain |
| **D. Data Assets** | All tables & metric views | Table format |
| **E. General Instructions** | **≤20 LINES** | **CRITICAL LIMIT** |
| **F. TVFs** | All functions with signatures | Detailed specs |
| **G. Benchmark Questions** | 10-15 with **EXACT SQL** | Working SQL required |

**🔴 Missing any section = INCOMPLETE deliverable. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

---

## Core Setup Pattern

### Step 1: Create Space Document Structure

Follow the mandatory 7-section structure (A-G). Use the [configuration template](assets/templates/genie-space-config.yaml) as a starting point.

### Step 2: Write General Instructions (≤20 Lines)

Use the template from [Agent Instructions Guide](references/agent-instructions.md#general-instructions-mandatory-20-lines):

```markdown
## General Instructions

You are an expert {domain} analyst. Follow these rules:

1. **Primary Data Source:** Always use Metric Views first
2. **Use TVFs:** For common queries, prefer Table-Valued Functions
3. **Date Defaults:** If no date specified, default to last 30 days
4. **Aggregations:** Use SUM for totals, AVG for averages
5. **Sorting:** Sort by primary metric DESC unless specified
6. **Limits:** Return top 10-20 rows for ranking queries
7. **Currency:** Format as USD with 2 decimal places
8. **Percentages:** Show as % with 1 decimal place
9. **Synonyms:** Handle common term equivalents
10. **Context:** Explain results in business terms
11. **Comparisons:** Show absolute values and % difference
12. **Time Periods:** Support today, yesterday, last week, month, quarter, YTD
13. **Null Handling:** Exclude nulls from calculations
14. **Performance:** Never scan raw Bronze/Silver tables
15. **Accuracy:** State assumptions when uncertain
```

### Step 3: Document Data Assets

Add assets in order: Metric Views → TVFs → Tables. Document each with:
- **Metric Views:** Measures, dimensions, use cases
- **TVFs:** Signature, parameters, return schema, use cases
- **Tables:** Purpose, when to use

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#section-d-data-assets) for detailed patterns.

### Step 4: Write Benchmark Questions (Interactive Intake)

Benchmark questions validate that Genie routes correctly and generates accurate SQL. **Always prompt the user for their questions first before generating synthetic ones.**

#### Three-Path Workflow

| User Provides | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| **10+ questions** | Validate each against available assets. Report any that can't be answered (missing table, ambiguous terms, need more info). Proceed with valid set. |
| **1-9 questions** | Validate provided questions. Report issues. Augment with synthetic benchmarks to reach 10-15 total. |
| **No questions** | Generate 10-15 synthetic benchmarks from metric view measures, TVF signatures, and table schemas. Show to user for review. |

#### Validation Rules for User-Submitted Questions

For each submitted question, verify:

| Check | What to Verify | If Failed, Tell the User |
|-------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Asset coverage** | At least one MV/TVF/table can answer it | "No asset in this space can answer '{question}'. Available domains: {list}." |
| **Table existence** | SQL only references trusted assets | "SQL references `{table}` which isn't a trusted asset." |
| **MEASURE() columns** | Column names match actual MV columns | "MEASURE({col}) doesn't match any column. Available: {list}." |
| **UC namespace** | SQL uses `${catalog}.${gold_schema}.{object}` | "SQL must use full 3-part UC namespace." |
| **TVF parameters** | All required parameters present | "TVF `{name}` requires: {params}. Missing: {missing}." |
| **Ambiguous terms** | Terms like "underperforming", "top" are defined | "What does '{term}' mean here? Revenue? Ratings? Bookings?" |

**If a question cannot be answered** (missing table, no matching data), inform the user with the specific reason and suggest alternatives based on available assets.

**If a question needs clarification** (ambiguous terms, missing time range), ask the user to clarify before including it.

#### Synthetic Generation (When User Provides None or Few)

Generate benchmarks from available asset metadata:
1. **From Metric Views** — one aggregation question per measure, one grouped question per dimension
2. **From TVFs** — one question per function matching its use case (ranking, time-series, detail)
3. **From Tables** — list/detail questions for dimension tables (only if needed to fill gaps)
4. **Category coverage** — ensure at least 4 categories: aggregation, ranking, time-series, comparison, list

After generation, **show the synthetic benchmarks to the user** for review before proceeding.

#### Augmentation (When User Provides Partial Set)

When augmenting user-provided questions:
1. **User questions always take priority** — never replace them
2. **Fill category gaps first** — if user only provided aggregation questions, add ranking/time-series/list
3. **Add synonym variations** — test Genie handles "total spend" vs "how much spent" vs "total costs"
4. **Add date variations** — "this month" vs "last 30 days" vs "Q1 2026"
5. **Cap at 15 total** — user questions + synthetic augmentation

See [Benchmark Intake Workflow](references/benchmark-intake-workflow.md) for the full validation pipeline, generation patterns, and augmentation strategy.

#### Output Format for Each Benchmark

Every question must include:
- Natural language question
- Expected SQL (tested and working)
- Expected result description

**⚠️ JSON field name:** In the API-compatible JSON export, benchmark SQL goes in `answer: [{format: "SQL", content: ["SELECT ..."]}]` — **NOT** in a field called `expected_sql`. The term "Expected SQL" here refers to the content, not the JSON field name. See `genie-space-export-import-api` for the exact `BenchmarkQuestion` schema.

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#section-g-benchmark-questions) for format.

### Step 5: Deploy and Test

**Choose your deployment path:**

| Method | When to Use | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| **UI** | One-off setup, manual curation | This skill (continue below) |
| **REST API / CI/CD** | Automated deployment, cross-workspace migration, version control | **Load [`genie-space-export-import-api`](../genie-space-export-import-api/SKILL.md)** |

**UI deployment steps:**
1. Inspect all target table schemas (verify comments, column names, data types)
2. Create Genie Space in Databricks UI with **Serverless SQL Warehouse**
3. Add trusted assets in order (Metric Views → TVFs → Tables) -- **Gold layer ONLY**
4. Set General Instructions (copy exactly, verify ≤20 lines)
5. Test benchmark questions **programmatically** via Conversation API
6. Validate routing, response quality, and follow-up context

**API deployment steps:** Load the `genie-space-export-import-api` skill for:
- JSON schema structure (`serialized_space` format)
- Template variable substitution (`${catalog}`, `${gold_schema}`)
- Asset inventory-driven generation (prevents "table doesn't exist" errors)
- Export/import scripts (`export_genie_space.py`, `import_genie_space.py`)

See [Configuration Guide](references/configuration-guide.md#deployment-checklist) for complete steps.

- [ ] Benchmark questions validated programmatically via Conversation API
- [ ] Only Gold layer tables/views/functions used as trusted assets

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| General Instructions > 20 lines | Genie won't process effectively past 20 lines |
| Benchmark questions without SQL | Cannot validate Genie responses |
| Display names in MEASURE() | Requires actual column names from YAML |
| Partial UC namespaces | Always use full 3-part: `${catalog}.${schema}.{object}` |
| Only tables as trusted assets | Start with Metric Views for better performance |
| Contradictory routing rules | Group by question type, not asset |
| Undefined ambiguous terms | Define "underperforming", "top performing" explicitly |
| Incorrect TVF syntax | No TABLE() wrapper, include all params, no extra GROUP BY |
| Classic/Pro SQL Warehouse | ALWAYS use Serverless (fast startup, auto-scaling) |
| Tables without comments | Genie uses UC metadata; missing = worse SQL |
| Cryptic column names (`clv`) | Use descriptive (`customer_lifetime_value`) for accuracy |
| Skipping table inspection | DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED before adding assets |
| UI-only testing | Validate programmatically via Conversation API |
| Reusing conversations across topics | New conversation per topic; `ask_genie_followup` only for related |
| Silver/Bronze as trusted assets | Gold layer only; Silver/Bronze lack business semantics |

## Genie Space Notes to Carry Forward

After completing Genie Space configuration, carry these notes to the next worker:
- **Genie Space names and JSON paths:** List of all configured spaces with their JSON config file paths
- **Asset assignments per space:** Which Metric Views, TVFs, and Gold Tables are assigned to each space
- **Benchmark question counts:** Number of benchmark questions per space (minimum 10 required)
- **Warehouse assignment:** SQL Warehouse ID assigned to each space
- **Space IDs (if deployed):** Genie Space IDs returned from API creation (needed for idempotent re-deployment)
- **Template variables used:** Confirm `${catalog}` and `${gold_schema}` are used for portability

## Next Step

After Genie Space JSON configs are generated, proceed to:
**`semantic-layer/04-genie-space-export-import-api/SKILL.md`** — If deploying via REST API (recommended for cross-environment promotion). Otherwise, proceed to Phase 4 (Asset Bundle Configuration) in the orchestrator.
