# Documentation Organization & Framework Authoring

This skill serves two complementary purposes:

1. **Organizational Enforcement** — Ensures every documentation file lands in the right place with the right name, every time.
2. **Framework Documentation Authoring** — Orchestrates creation of complete, professional documentation sets for technical frameworks and systems using structured templates.

---

## Decision Tree: Which Mode Do I Need?

| User Intent | Mode | What Happens |
|------------|------|-------------|
| "Create a deployment checklist" | **Organizational** | Route to `docs/deployment/deployment-checklist.md`, suggest cleanup |
| "Document this issue" | **Organizational** | Route to `docs/troubleshooting/issue-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` |
| "Write next steps" | **Organizational** | Route to `docs/development/roadmap.md` or suggest issue tracker |
| "Document the ML framework" | **Framework** | Gather requirements, generate full doc set from templates |
| "Create architecture docs for the alerting system" | **Framework** | Generate `docs/alerting-framework-design/` with all templates |
| "Help me create comprehensive docs for this project" | **Framework** | Run full requirements + template workflow |
| File is `.md` and being created | **Organizational** | Auto-check location before creation |
| Root has >3 `.md` files | **Organizational** | Proactively suggest cleanup |

---

## Mode 1: Organizational Enforcement

### Auto-Trigger Conditions

I will **automatically** enforce organization when:
- Creating any `.md` file (check location first)
- User mentions: "document", "checklist", "summary", "guide", "issue", "steps"
- Root directory has >3 `.md` files (excluding README/QUICKSTART/CHANGELOG)
- See files matching patterns: `*DEPLOYMENT*`, `*CHECKLIST*`, `ISSUE*`, `*STEPS*`, `*SUMMARY*`

### Root Directory Rules (Enforce Always)

#### ALLOWED in Root (Only These)

```
README.md              # Project hub with links
QUICKSTART.md          # Commands-only quick start  
CHANGELOG.md           # Version history (optional)
LICENSE                # License file (optional)
```

#### NEVER Allowed in Root

```
*DEPLOYMENT*.md        → docs/deployment/deployment-history/YYYY-MM-DD-name.md
*CHECKLIST*.md         → docs/deployment/checklist-name.md
ISSUE*.md              → docs/troubleshooting/issue-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
*STEPS*.md             → docs/development/roadmap.md (or delete if temporary)
*SUMMARY*.md           → docs/reference/ or merge into README.md
*GUIDE*.md             → docs/deployment/ or docs/operations/
.hidden-*.md           → docs/[appropriate-category]/
```

### Standard Project Structure (Always Use)

```
project_root/
├── README.md                          
├── QUICKSTART.md                      
├── docs/
│   ├── deployment/
│   │   ├── deployment-guide.md
│   │   ├── pre-deployment-checklist.md
│   │   ├── deployment-checklist.md
│   │   └── deployment-history/
│   │       └── YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
│   ├── troubleshooting/
│   │   ├── common-issues.md
│   │   └── issue-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
│   ├── architecture/
│   │   └── architecture-overview.md
│   ├── operations/
│   │   ├── monitoring.md
│   │   └── runbooks/
│   ├── development/
│   │   ├── roadmap.md
│   │   └── setup.md
│   ├── reference/
│   │   ├── configuration.md
│   │   └── glossary.md
│   └── {framework-name}-design/        # Framework documentation sets
│       ├── 00-index.md
│       ├── 01-introduction.md
│       └── ...
└── context/
    └── prompts/
```

### Naming Rules (Always Enforce)

| Format | Use For | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `kebab-case.md` | All docs | `deployment-guide.md` |
| `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` | Historical/dated | `2025-01-15-bronze-deployment.md` |
| `NN-descriptive-name.md` | Framework docs (numbered) | `03-feature-engineering.md` |
| NEVER `PascalCase.md` | -- | `DeploymentGuide.md` |
| NEVER `ALL_CAPS.md` | -- | `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` |
| NEVER `snake_case.md` | -- | `deployment_guide.md` |

### Automatic Response Pattern

**Before creating any `.md` file, I will always check:**

```python
# Location routing logic (I run this mentally)
if filename in ["README.md", "QUICKSTART.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]:
    location = "root"  # OK
elif "deployment" in content or "checklist" in filename:
    location = "docs/deployment/"
elif "issue" in filename or "troubleshoot" in content:
    location = "docs/troubleshooting/"
elif "architecture" in content or "design" in content:
    location = "docs/architecture/"
elif user_intent == "framework documentation":
    location = "docs/{framework-name}-design/"  # → Switch to Mode 2
elif user_intent == "temporary notes":
    suggest_alternative = "Use issue tracker or delete after completion"
```

**My response format:**

```
I'll create that documentation in the correct location:
  docs/[category]/[kebab-case-name].md

I also notice these files should be organized:
  DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md → docs/deployment/deployment-history/2025-01-15-summary.md
  .deployment-checklist.md → docs/deployment/deployment-checklist.md
  ISSUE_RESOLUTION.md → docs/troubleshooting/issue-2025-01-15-parameter-fix.md

Would you like me to reorganize these?
```

### Proactive Cleanup Suggestions

#### Trigger: User Creates Documentation

| User Says | I Suggest |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Create a deployment summary" | `docs/deployment/deployment-history/YYYY-MM-DD-summary.md` |
| "Document this issue" | `docs/troubleshooting/issue-YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md` |
| "Make a checklist" | `docs/deployment/[type]-checklist.md` |
| "Write next steps" | `docs/development/roadmap.md` or "Use issue tracker instead?" |

#### Trigger: Multiple Files in Root

When I see >3 `.md` files in root:

```
Root directory has [N] documentation files. I recommend organizing them:

Current structure:
  7 files in root

Suggested structure:
  3 files in root (README, QUICKSTART, CHANGELOG)
  4 files in docs/deployment/
  
Would you like me to create a cleanup plan?
```

See `scripts/organize_docs.sh` for the automated cleanup script.

### Special Cases

#### Temporary Files
If user wants "quick notes" or "temporary file":
- Suggest: Use your IDE scratch file or issue tracker
- Alternative: `docs/development/wip-notes.md` (but add reminder to delete)

#### Historical Records
Always preserve, never delete:
- `docs/deployment/deployment-history/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
- `docs/troubleshooting/issue-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`

#### Consolidation Opportunity
If I see duplicate content:
```
I notice:
- README.md has deployment info (100 lines)
- docs/deployment/deployment-guide.md has same content
- QUICKSTART.md duplicates some steps

Suggest:
- Keep brief summary in README with link
- Full guide in docs/deployment/deployment-guide.md
- QUICKSTART only has commands, links to guide for details
```

## Mode 2: Framework Documentation Authoring

Use this mode when creating comprehensive documentation for a technical framework, system, or multi-component project. This is an orchestrated workflow that produces a complete, professional documentation set.

### When to Activate Framework Mode

- User asks to "document the [framework/system]"
- User asks for "architecture docs", "comprehensive docs", or "documentation set"
- Project has 5+ components that need structured documentation
- User is creating documentation for training or onboarding purposes

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering (5 min)

**MANDATORY: Before generating any templates, gather requirements from the user.**

Present the requirements table (see `references/framework-examples.md` for the full template):

| Field | Your Input |
|-------|------------|
| **Framework/System Name** | _________________ |
| **Primary Audience** | _________________ |
| **Secondary Audience** | _________________ |
| **Documentation Purpose** | [ ] Project Documentation  [ ] Training Material  [ ] Both |
| **Technology Stack** | _________________ |
| **Number of Components** | _________________ |

Then determine documentation depth:

| Level | Description | Needed? |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Executive Summary** | 1-page overview for leadership | [ ] |
| **Architecture Guide** | System design, data flows, component interactions | [ ] |
| **Implementation Guide** | Step-by-step build instructions | [ ] |
| **Operations Guide** | Deployment, monitoring, maintenance | [ ] |
| **Reference Manual** | API docs, configurations, schemas | [ ] |
| **Troubleshooting Guide** | Common errors and solutions | [ ] |
| **Best Practices** | Patterns and anti-patterns | [ ] |

### Step 2: Generate File Structure (5 min)

Based on requirements, create the numbered file structure under `docs/{framework-name}-design/`:

```
docs/{framework-name}-design/
├── 00-index.md                    # Always included
├── 01-introduction.md             # Always included
├── 02-architecture-overview.md    # If Architecture Guide selected
├── 03-{component-type-1}.md       # Per major component
├── 04-{component-type-2}.md       # Per major component
├── ...
├── {n}-implementation-guide.md    # If Implementation Guide selected
├── {n+1}-operations-guide.md      # If Operations Guide selected
└── appendices/
    ├── A-code-examples.md         # If Reference Manual selected
    ├── B-troubleshooting.md       # If Troubleshooting Guide selected
    └── C-references.md            # Always included
```

### Step 3: Fill Templates (Varies — 30 min to 4 hours)

**Load `references/document-templates.md` for complete fill-in-the-blank templates.**

Templates available (load only the ones needed):
1. **00-index.md** — Document index, architecture summary, quick start, key statistics
2. **01-introduction.md** — Purpose, scope, prerequisites, timeline, success criteria
3. **02-architecture-overview.md** — Mermaid/ASCII diagrams, data flows, component inventory, design principles
4. **Component Deep Dive** — Key concepts, configuration, code patterns, best practices, common issues
5. **Implementation Guide** — Phased steps with validation, deployment commands, rollback procedures
6. **Operations Guide** — Health checks, alerting, escalation matrix, incident response, backup/recovery
7. **Troubleshooting Guide** — Error-solution matrix, diagnostic procedures, FAQ

### Step 4: Quality Validation

**Load `references/quality-checklist.md` for the comprehensive quality checklist** covering:
1. Organization & Location (7 checks)
2. Naming Conventions (5 checks)
3. Structure & Navigation (6 checks)
4. Content Quality (7 checks)
5. Usability (6 checks)
6. Maintenance & Longevity (5 checks)
7. Special Cases (7 checks)

### Worked Examples

**Load `references/framework-examples.md` for complete worked examples** including:
- ML Framework (25 models, 5 domains → 17 docs + 3 appendices)
- Alerting Framework (56 alerts, 5 domains → 10 docs + 3 appendices)
- Semantic Layer (focused scope → 7 docs + 3 appendices)
- Scaling guidelines (small/medium/large projects)

## Enforcement Checklist (I Run Mentally Before Every Response)

Before responding to any documentation request:

- [ ] **Location**: Is this README/QUICKSTART/CHANGELOG? (only valid root files)
- [ ] **Routing**: Propose correct `docs/[category]/` location
- [ ] **Naming**: Use `kebab-case`, add date if historical, add number if framework doc
- [ ] **Root audit**: Count root `.md` files — suggest cleanup if >3
- [ ] **Misplaced files**: Offer to move existing misplaced files
- [ ] **README links**: Update README.md links if creating major new documentation
- [ ] **Mode detection**: Is this organizational (quick routing) or framework (full template workflow)?

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Organizational Mode (Quick Routing)

```
User: "Create a deployment checklist"

My response:
I'll create: docs/deployment/deployment-checklist.md

I also see these in root that should be moved:
- DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md → docs/deployment/deployment-history/2025-01-15-summary.md
- PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md → docs/deployment/pre-deployment-checklist.md

Want me to reorganize?
```

### Example 2: Organizational Mode (Bad — I Never Do This)

```
User: "Create a deployment checklist"

My response:
I'll create: DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md   [WRONG — wrong location, wrong naming]
[Creates file without checking structure]  [WRONG — no proactive cleanup]
```

### Example 3: Framework Mode (Full Workflow)

```
User: "Document the ML framework"

My response:
I'll create comprehensive framework documentation. First, let me gather requirements:

1. Framework Name: ML Framework
2. Primary Audience: ML Engineers
3. Components: 25 models across 5 domains
4. Depth needed: Architecture + Implementation + Operations + Troubleshooting

Generating docs/ml-framework-design/ with:
  00-index.md, 01-introduction.md, 02-architecture-overview.md,
  03-feature-engineering.md, ... 17-operations-guide.md
  + appendices/A-code-examples.md, B-troubleshooting.md, C-references.md

[Loads references/document-templates.md for fill-in templates]
[Generates each document from templates]
[Runs references/quality-checklist.md for validation]
```

## Integration with Project Structure

### Clear Separation of Concerns

| Location | Purpose | Maintained By |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `data_product_accelerator/skills/` | Agent skills (AI behavioral patterns) | This skill system |
| `context/prompts/` | Domain context for AI | Project team |
| `docs/` | Human-readable documentation | This skill (organizational + framework) |

### How This Skill Relates to Others

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `common/databricks-expert-agent` | Extract-don't-generate principle applies to doc content too |
| `admin/self-improvement` | Documents learnings and patterns — this skill enforces WHERE |
| `planning/project-plan-methodology` | Plans produce docs — this skill enforces structure |
| All domain skills | Technical content goes in `docs/` using this skill's structure |

---

## Summary: What I Will Always Do

1. Check location before creating any `.md` file
2. Suggest correct `docs/[category]/` location
3. Use `kebab-case.md` naming (numbered for framework docs)
4. Add dates for historical docs (`YYYY-MM-DD-`)
5. Proactively suggest cleanup when root has >3 files
6. Offer cleanup script when I see misorganized files
7. Never create status/summary/checklist files in root
8. Always preserve historical records in `deployment-history/`
9. Detect framework documentation requests and switch to full template workflow
10. Gather requirements before generating framework documentation
11. Use standardized templates from `references/document-templates.md`
12. Validate all documentation against `references/quality-checklist.md`
