# Evolve Command

Extracts patterns from accumulated findings and evolves agent runbooks with learned knowledge.

## Usage

```
/evolve                    Full analysis and promotion
/evolve --dry-run          Show what would be promoted without making changes
/evolve --since <days>     Only analyze findings from last N days
/evolve --pattern <name>   Analyze specific pattern only
/evolve --agent <name>     Only update runbooks for specific agent
```

## Arguments

Options: $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Collection

1. **Load review findings**
   ```bash
   # Read all findings
   cat .claude/review-findings.jsonl
   ```

2. **Load session learnings**
   ```bash
   # Read agent-contributed learnings
   cat .claude/session-learnings.jsonl
   ```

3. **Load existing pattern registry**
   ```bash
   cat .claude/patterns/patterns.json
   ```

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

For each finding:

1. **Extract or infer pattern name**
   - Use explicit `pattern` field if present
   - Otherwise infer from description keywords:
     - "missing validation" → `unvalidated-input`
     - "race condition" → `concurrency-race`
     - "status condition" → `missing-status-condition`
     - "nil pointer" → `nil-dereference`
     - "hardcoded" → `hardcoded-value`

2. **Group findings by pattern**
   - Count occurrences
   - Track affected services
   - Track affected agents
   - Collect code examples

3. **Calculate confidence score**
   ```
   confidence = (
     0.4 * min(count/10, 1.0) +      # Occurrence frequency
     0.3 * severity_score +           # Severity weight
     0.2 * recency_score +            # Recent patterns matter more
     0.1 * consistency_score          # Cross-service patterns
   )
   ```

4. **Detect trends**
   - Compare current 30-day window to previous 30-day window
   - Flag increasing (50%+ more), decreasing (50%+ fewer), or stable

### Phase 3: Pattern Registry Update

Update `.claude/patterns/patterns.json`:

```json
{
  "patterns": {
    "pattern-name": {
      "name": "pattern-name",
      "description": "What this pattern represents",
      "category": "correctness|security|convention|completeness|performance",
      "severity": "blocking|warning|nit",
      "occurrences": [...],
      "count": 7,
      "first_seen": "2024-11-01",
      "last_seen": "2025-01-15",
      "trend": "stable|increasing|decreasing|new|resolved",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "affected_agents": ["api-dev", "code-reviewer"],
      "fix_template": "How to fix this issue",
      "promoted_to_runbook": false
    }
  },
  "meta": {
    "last_analysis": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "total_findings_analyzed": 142,
    "total_patterns": 23
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Runbook Promotion

For patterns meeting promotion criteria:
- Count >= 3
- Confidence >= 0.6
- Not already promoted

Generate runbook entry:

```markdown
### {Pattern Name} (Auto-generated)

**Confidence**: {score} | **Occurrences**: {count} | **Trend**: {trend}

**Context**: {When this pattern appears}

**Anti-Pattern**: {What to avoid}

**Instead**: {What to do}

**Example**:
```go
{Code example}
```

**Learned from**: {PR references}

*Auto-generated on {date}*
```

Append to `.claude/skills/runbooks/{agent}/RUNBOOK.md` for each affected agent.

### Phase 5: Generate Reports

**Trend alerts** (written to `.claude/patterns/trends.json`):

```json
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "type": "increasing_pattern",
      "pattern": "unvalidated-input",
      "message": "Input validation issues increased 150% this month"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Cross-service alerts**:
- When pattern from ServiceA likely exists in ServiceB
- Based on similar code structures and dependencies

## Output

```
=== EVOLVE ANALYSIS ===

Findings analyzed: 47 (last 30 days)
Patterns identified: 12
New patterns: 2
Updated patterns: 8

=== PATTERN SUMMARY ===

HIGH CONFIDENCE (>= 0.8):
  missing-status-condition    [12 occurrences] [stable]     → Promoted to: api-dev
  unvalidated-input          [8 occurrences]  [increasing] → Promoted to: api-dev

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (0.6-0.8):
  storage-init-race          [4 occurrences]  [stable]     → Promoted to: api-dev
  missing-error-context      [3 occurrences]  [new]        → Promoted to: api-dev

LOW CONFIDENCE (< 0.6):
  import-ordering            [2 occurrences]  [stable]     → Tracking only

=== TREND ALERTS ===

⚠️  INCREASING: unvalidated-input (+150% vs last month)
    Consider: Team training on input validation patterns

✅ DECREASING: hardcoded-value (-60% vs last month)
    Team may be improving on this pattern

=== RUNBOOK UPDATES ===

Updated: .claude/skills/runbooks/api-dev/RUNBOOK.md
  + Added: missing-status-condition (anti-pattern)
  + Added: unvalidated-input (anti-pattern)
  + Added: storage-init-race (anti-pattern)

Updated: .claude/skills/runbooks/code-reviewer/RUNBOOK.md
  + Added: missing-status-condition (check priority)
  + Added: unvalidated-input (check priority)

=== CROSS-SERVICE ALERTS ===

⚠️  Pattern 'storage-init-race' found in compute-api
    May also exist in: network-api, storage-api
    Check: pkg/registry/*/storage.go

=== NEXT STEPS ===

1. Review auto-generated runbook entries
2. Address increasing pattern: unvalidated-input
3. Investigate cross-service alert for storage-init-race
```

## Error Handling

**No findings file:**
```
No findings found at .claude/review-findings.jsonl
Run code reviews to generate findings, then try again.
```

**No new patterns:**
```
No new patterns detected since last analysis.
Pattern registry is up to date.
```

## Integration

After `/evolve` completes:
- Agents will read updated runbooks in their next invocation
- Code-reviewer will prioritize high-confidence patterns
- Pattern trends inform team process improvements

## Scheduling

Recommended schedule:
- **After each code review**: Incremental finding capture (automatic)
- **Weekly**: Full `/evolve` analysis
- **Monthly**: Review auto-generated entries for accuracy
