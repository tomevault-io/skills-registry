# Architecture Design

## Overview

This skill enables you to design comprehensive software solution architectures including system components, technology stacks, integration patterns, scalability strategies, and deployment models.

## Core Capabilities

When activated, this skill provides:

1. **Requirements Analysis & Architecture Planning**
   - Analyze functional and non-functional requirements
   - Identify architectural drivers (scalability, security, performance)
   - Define system boundaries and constraints
   - Establish architecture goals and success criteria

2. **System Architecture Design**
   - Design layered/tiered architectures
   - Create microservices and domain-driven designs
   - Design event-driven and message-based systems
   - Plan serverless and cloud-native architectures
   - Design monolithic, modular monolithic, or distributed systems

3. **Technology Stack Selection**
   - Evaluate and justify programming languages and frameworks
   - Select databases with rationale (SQL, NoSQL, time-series, graph)
   - Choose middleware and integration platforms (message queues, API gateways)
   - Select infrastructure and cloud platforms (assess vendor lock-in)
   - Recommend CI/CD and DevOps tools
   - Document technology decisions in ADRs with alternatives considered
   - Assess team skills and training needs for new technologies

4. **Architecture Patterns & Best Practices**
   - Apply design patterns (MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal)
   - Implement integration patterns (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, message queues)
   - Design for scalability (horizontal/vertical, caching, CDN)
   - Implement security patterns (OAuth, JWT, zero-trust)
   - Apply resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries, bulkheads)

5. **Documentation & Deliverables**
   - Create C4 model diagrams in Mermaid format (Context, Container, Component, Code)
   - Generate Mermaid diagrams (class, sequence, deployment)
   - Produce architecture decision records (ADRs)
   - Write technical specifications and API contracts
   - Create implementation roadmaps and migration plans

## Architecture Design Workflow

Follow this systematic process:

## Step 1: Discovery & Requirements

1. **Gather Requirements**
   - Functional requirements (features, use cases)
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security)
   - Business constraints (budget, timeline, compliance)
   - Technical constraints (existing systems, team skills)

2. **Analyze Architecture Drivers**
   - Performance: latency, throughput targets
   - Scalability: user growth, data volume projections
   - Availability: uptime SLA, disaster recovery needs
   - Security: authentication, authorization, compliance requirements
   - Maintainability: testability, modularity goals

3. **Define System Context**
   - Identify stakeholders and their needs
   - Map external systems and dependencies
   - Define system boundaries
   - Identify integration points

### Step 2: Architecture Design

1. **Choose Architecture Style**

Select based on requirements and constraints:

**Monolithic**

- Use for: Simple applications, MVPs, small teams, tight deadlines
- Benefits: Simple deployment, strong consistency, no network overhead
- Trade-offs: Scaling limitations, technology lock-in

**Modular Monolithic**

- Use for: Medium complexity, clear domain boundaries
- Benefits: Better organization, some isolation, shared infrastructure
- Trade-offs: Still single deployment, limited independent scaling

**Microservices**

- Use for: Large scale, multiple teams, different tech stacks
- Benefits: Independent scaling/deployment, technology flexibility
- Trade-offs: Distributed complexity, network overhead, eventual consistency

**Serverless**

- Use for: Event-driven, variable load, rapid development
- Benefits: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, no infrastructure management
- Trade-offs: Cold starts, vendor lock-in, debugging complexity

**Event-Driven**

- Use for: Real-time processing, loose coupling, high throughput
- Benefits: Scalability, flexibility, asynchronous processing
- Trade-offs: Complexity, eventual consistency, debugging challenges

1. **Design System Components**

Define key layers and components:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Presentation Layer            │  UI, Controllers, APIs
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Application Layer             │  Use Cases, Orchestration
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Domain Layer                  │  Business Logic, Entities
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Data Layer                    │  Databases, Caches
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Infrastructure Layer          │  External APIs, Services
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Define Data Architecture**
   - Design data models and schemas
   - Choose database types (relational, document, graph, time-series)
   - Plan data partitioning and sharding strategies
   - Design caching layers (Redis, Memcached)
   - Define data flows and ETL processes

2. **Design Integration Points**
   - API design (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
   - Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
   - Event streaming architectures
   - Authentication and authorization flows
   - Rate limiting and throttling strategies

### Step 3: Document Architecture

1. **Create Architecture Diagrams**

Use C4 model in Mermaid format for comprehensive documentation:

- **Context**: System in environment with users and external systems (use Mermaid C4Context)
- **Container**: High-level technology choices and communication (use Mermaid C4Container)
- **Component**: Internal structure of containers (use Mermaid C4Component)
- **Code**: Class diagrams for complex components (use Mermaid classDiagram)

All diagrams should use Mermaid syntax for easy versioning and rendering in markdown.

1. **Write Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**

Document all significant decisions using structured ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-001: [Decision Title]

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded

## Context
[Problem and constraints requiring decision]

## Decision
[Chosen solution and approach]

## Consequences
[Benefits and trade-offs]
```

**Full ADR Template**: See [adr-template.md](references/adr-template.md) for complete structure with examples

1. **Produce Technical Specifications**
   - System overview and objectives
   - Component descriptions and responsibilities
   - API contracts and interfaces
   - Data models and schemas
   - Security and compliance measures
   - Deployment and operations guidelines

### Step 4: Validate & Review

1. **Quality Attributes Assessment**
   - Performance: Response time, throughput
   - Scalability: Horizontal/vertical scaling capabilities
   - Availability: Fault tolerance, disaster recovery
   - Security: Authentication, authorization, encryption
   - Maintainability: Code organization, testability
   - Cost: Infrastructure and operational expenses

2. **Design Validation Checklist**

Ensure architecture is review-ready:

- [ ] All functional and non-functional requirements addressed
- [ ] Architecture style justified with trade-offs documented
- [ ] Scalability strategy defined (horizontal/vertical, capacity planning)
- [ ] Security measures implemented (authentication, authorization, encryption)
- [ ] Data architecture validated (storage, consistency, replication)
- [ ] Integration patterns specified (sync/async, APIs, events)
- [ ] Monitoring and observability planned (metrics, logs, traces, alerts)
- [ ] Disaster recovery and backup strategy documented (RPO/RTO)
- [ ] Cost estimates provided (infrastructure, operations, scaling)
- [ ] Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) created for major decisions
