description: Provides comprehensive AWS (Amazon Web Services) guidance including EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, ECS/EKS, CloudFormation, API Gateway, CloudFront, cloud migration from on-premise/GCP/Azure, security configuration (IAM, KMS, Security Hub), cost optimization (Savings Plans, Reserved Instances), and multi-region deployment. Produces infrastructure as code (Terraform/CloudFormation/CDK), deployment scripts, security configurations, and architecture designs. Use when deploying to AWS, designing AWS infrastructure, migrating to AWS, configuring EC2 instances, setting up S3 buckets, managing RDS databases, deploying containers on ECS/EKS, building serverless applications, or when users mention AWS, Amazon Cloud, EC2, S3, Lambda, EKS, CloudFormation, CDK, or AWS services.

# AWS Cloud

## Core Capabilities

Provides expert guidance for AWS infrastructure and services:

1. **Compute Services** - EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS, Fargate, Batch, Elastic Beanstalk
2. **Storage Services** - S3, EBS, EFS, FSx, Glacier, Storage Gateway
3. **Database Services** - RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server), Aurora, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, DocumentDB
4. **Networking** - VPC, ALB/NLB, Route 53, CloudFront, Direct Connect, VPN, Transit Gateway
5. **Container Services** - ECS (Elastic Container Service), EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
6. **Serverless** - Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, EventBridge, SQS, SNS
7. **Infrastructure as Code** - CloudFormation, Terraform, CDK (Cloud Development Kit), SAM
8. **Security** - IAM, KMS, Secrets Manager, Security Hub, GuardDuty, WAF, Shield
9. **Migration** - Cloud migration strategies from on-premise, GCP, Azure to AWS

## Key Principles

## General Best Practices

- **Follow least privilege** - Use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- **Enable monitoring** - Configure CloudWatch for all services with appropriate alarms
- **Use managed services** - Prefer RDS over self-managed databases, ECS Fargate over EC2
- **Implement IaC** - Use CloudFormation, Terraform, or CDK for reproducible infrastructure
- **Tag resources** - Apply tags for cost allocation, automation, and compliance
- **Design for HA** - Use Multi-AZ deployments and Auto Scaling Groups
- **Secure by default** - Enable encryption, use private subnets, configure security groups properly
- **Optimize costs** - Use Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, Spot Instances, and right-sizing

### Architecture Patterns

- **Multi-tier web apps**: VPC + ALB + EC2/ECS + RDS Multi-AZ
- **Serverless APIs**: API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB with CloudFront caching
- **Container workloads**: ECS/EKS with Fargate + RDS + ElastiCache
- **Data processing**: S3 + Lambda/Glue + Athena/EMR + QuickSight
- **Microservices**: EKS + Service Mesh + RDS Aurora + ElastiCache

### When to Use What

- **EC2**: Full control, Windows workloads, lift-and-shift migrations, specialized hardware
- **Lambda**: Event-driven processing, APIs, scheduled tasks, short-lived workloads (<15 min)
- **ECS/EKS**: Containerized applications, microservices, long-running services
- **RDS**: Relational databases with automated backups, Multi-AZ, read replicas
- **Aurora**: High-performance MySQL/PostgreSQL, serverless option, global databases
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL, single-digit millisecond latency, serverless, automatic scaling
- **S3**: Object storage, static websites, data lakes, backups, archival
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Quick deployment, managed platform, minimal configuration
