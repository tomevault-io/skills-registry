2. **Storage Services** - Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files, Azure Disk Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage
3. **Database Services** - Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL, Azure Redis Cache
4. **Networking** - Azure Virtual Network (VNet), Azure Load Balancer, Application Gateway, Azure Front Door, VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute
5. **Container Services** - AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), Azure Container Registry, Azure Container Instances
6. **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform, Bicep, ARM Templates, Azure CLI, PowerShell
7. **Security** - Azure Active Directory (Entra ID), Azure Key Vault, Azure Security Center, Azure Sentinel, Azure Policy
8. **DevOps & CI/CD** - Azure DevOps, Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions with Azure integration
9. **Monitoring** - Azure Monitor, Application Insights, Log Analytics, Azure Alerts

## Best Practices

## Azure Virtual Machines

- Select appropriate VM sizes based on workload (D-series, F-series, E-series)
- Use managed disks for simplified management and availability
- Enable Azure Backup for VM protection
- Use availability sets or availability zones for high availability
- Configure VM extensions for automated configuration
- Enable Azure Disk Encryption for data protection
- Use proximity placement groups for low latency

### Azure Storage

- Use storage account types based on use case (Standard vs Premium, Hot/Cool/Archive tiers)
- Enable soft delete for blob and container protection
- Use private endpoints for secure access
- Configure lifecycle management policies for cost optimization
- Enable Azure Storage encryption (SSE)
- Use Azure CDN with Blob Storage for content delivery
- Implement immutable blob storage for compliance

### Azure SQL Database

- Select appropriate service tier (Basic, Standard, Premium, Hyperscale)
- Enable automatic backups with long-term retention
- Use read replicas for read scaling
- Configure active geo-replication for disaster recovery
- Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- Use Always Encrypted for sensitive data
- Monitor with Query Performance Insight

### Azure Virtual Network

- Plan address space carefully using RFC 1918 ranges
- Use subnets to segment workloads and apply NSGs
- Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) with least privilege
- Use Azure Firewall for centralized network security
- Enable VNet peering for cross-VNet communication
- Use service endpoints and private endpoints for Azure services
- Implement network watcher for diagnostics

### AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)

- Use managed identity for AKS cluster authentication
- Configure multiple node pools with auto-scaling
- Enable Azure Policy for Kubernetes
- Use Azure Container Registry with image scanning
- Implement network policies with Azure CNI or Calico
- Enable cluster monitoring with Container Insights
- Configure ingress controllers with Application Gateway

### Security

- Enable Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Use managed identities instead of service principals where possible
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with least privilege
- Store secrets in Azure Key Vault
- Enable Azure Security Center for threat protection
- Use Azure Policy for governance and compliance
- Enable Azure Sentinel for SIEM capabilities
- Audit activities with Azure Activity Log

### Cost Optimization

- Use Azure Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Leverage Azure Spot VMs for fault-tolerant workloads
- Implement auto-scaling to match demand
- Use Azure Cost Management for budgets and alerts
- Right-size VMs based on Azure Advisor recommendations
- Use Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server and SQL Server
- Configure storage lifecycle policies to reduce costs

### DevOps Best Practices

- Use Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- Implement infrastructure as code with Bicep or Terraform
- Use Azure Key Vault for pipeline secrets
- Enable deployment slots for App Service blue-green deployments
- Implement automated testing in pipelines
- Use Azure Artifacts for package management
- Configure branch policies and pull request validation
