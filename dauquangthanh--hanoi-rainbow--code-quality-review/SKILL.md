# Code Quality Review

## Overview

Conducts systematic code quality analysis across multiple dimensions: maintainability, readability, complexity, design patterns, naming conventions, code duplication, and adherence to best practices. Produces actionable feedback with severity ratings and specific improvement recommendations.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Code Smells Detection** - Identifies bloaters, object-orientation abusers, change preventers, dispensables, and couplers
2. **Complexity Analysis** - Measures cyclomatic and cognitive complexity with risk assessment
3. **Maintainability Assessment** - Evaluates code maintainability index and technical debt
4. **Design Pattern Evaluation** - Reviews architectural patterns and SOLID principles
5. **Best Practices Validation** - Checks adherence to language-specific standards and conventions

## Review Workflow

## Step 1: Scope Assessment

Determine review scope based on change size:

- **Small (<100 lines)**: Quick correctness check, 15-30 minutes
- **Medium (100-500 lines)**: Full quality analysis, 1-2 hours  
- **Large (>500 lines)**: Architectural review, break into smaller reviews if possible, 2-4 hours

For scope-specific guidance, see [review-scope-guidelines.md](references/review-scope-guidelines.md)

### Step 2: Initial Assessment

**Gather Context:**

- Identify programming language and framework
- Understand project type (web app, API, library, CLI, etc.)
- Note existing coding standards or style guides
- Check for linter configuration files (.eslintrc, .pylintrc, checkstyle.xml, etc.)

**Read the Code:**

- Start with entry points (main files, index files)
- Review module/package organization
- Check dependency management
- Examine test files if available

### Step 3: Quality Analysis

Analyze code across key dimensions:

- **Code Smells**: Long methods, large classes, duplicate code, dead code, etc.
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity (target <15), cognitive complexity, nesting depth
- **Maintainability**: Clear naming, proper abstraction, separation of concerns
- **Design Patterns**: Appropriate pattern usage, SOLID principles adherence
- **Best Practices**: Language idioms, error handling, resource management

For detailed analysis criteria and thresholds, see [review-workflow.md](references/review-workflow.md)

For quality metrics and thresholds, see [quality-metrics-reference.md](references/quality-metrics-reference.md)

### Step 4: Document Findings

Structure the review report with:

- Executive summary with scores and top priorities
- Detailed findings with severity, location, description, and recommendations
- Metrics summary with current vs. target values
- Prioritized recommendations (P0-P3)
- Positive observations acknowledging good practices
- Technical debt summary with effort estimates

For complete report structure and output guidelines, see [review-report-format.md](references/review-report-format.md)

## Quality Assurance

Use the checklist to ensure comprehensive reviews:

- Code organization and structure
- Naming conventions and clarity
- Complexity thresholds
- Error handling patterns
- Testing and documentation
- Security considerations
- Performance implications

For complete checklist, see [best-practices-checklist.md](references/best-practices-checklist.md)

## Common Pitfalls

Avoid these common review mistakes:

- Focusing only on style issues instead of substantive problems
- Being overly critical without actionable suggestions
- Ignoring context and business constraints
- Overwhelming with too many issues at once
- Using vague terms without explanation
- Forgetting to acknowledge good practices

For detailed guidance, see [common-pitfalls-to-avoid.md](references/common-pitfalls-to-avoid.md)

## Example Patterns

For reference when identifying critical issues in your review, see examples of common high-severity problems in [critical-issues.md](references/critical-issues.md)
