# DevOps

## Core Capabilities

Provides expert guidance covering the entire software delivery lifecycle:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline Design** - Automated build, test, and deployment workflows
2. **Infrastructure as Code** - Cloud resource provisioning with Terraform, CloudFormation, Bicep
3. **Container Orchestration** - Docker and Kubernetes deployment patterns
4. **Deployment Strategies** - Blue-green, canary, and rolling deployments
5. **Monitoring & Observability** - Metrics, logging, alerting with Prometheus, Grafana, ELK
6. **Configuration Management** - Ansible, Chef, Puppet automation
7. **Security & Compliance** - DevSecOps practices and container security

## Best Practices

## CI/CD

- Keep pipelines fast (< 10 minutes for feedback)
- Fail fast with quick tests first
- Use pipeline as code (version controlled)
- Implement proper secret management
- Enable artifact caching and parallelize independent jobs

### Infrastructure as Code

- Use remote state with locking
- Create reusable modules and pin versions
- Always review plan before apply
- Implement proper tagging strategy
- Document resource dependencies

### Container Orchestration

- Set resource requests and limits
- Implement health checks (liveness/readiness probes)
- Use pod anti-affinity for high availability
- Enable horizontal pod autoscaling
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

### Deployment

- Use rolling updates with zero downtime
- Implement proper health checks and rollback capabilities
- Use canary/blue-green for critical applications
- Test thoroughly in staging environments
- Monitor post-deployment metrics

### Security

- Run containers as non-root with read-only root filesystems
- Scan images for vulnerabilities regularly
- Implement network policies and secrets management
- Enable pod security standards and least privilege access

### Monitoring

- Collect metrics using RED/USE methods
- Implement structured logging with meaningful alerts
- Create actionable dashboards and monitor SLIs/SLOs
- Set up distributed tracing for microservices
