# Frontend Code Review

Systematically review frontend code to identify issues, ensure quality, and provide actionable improvement recommendations across code quality, performance, accessibility, and security dimensions.

## Review Workflow

## 1. Initial Assessment

Gather context about the project and identify review scope:

**Project Context:**

- Framework and version (React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS)
- Build tools and dependencies
- Target browsers/devices
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG level)
- Performance targets (Core Web Vitals)

**Review Scope:**

- New features vs. refactoring vs. bug fixes
- Component complexity level
- Critical user paths
- Security-sensitive areas

### 2. Code Quality Analysis

Evaluate component structure, code patterns, and maintainability:

**Key Areas:**

- Component architecture (single responsibility, composition patterns)
- JavaScript/TypeScript quality (type safety, naming, complexity)
- State management decisions (local vs. global, immutability)
- Error handling and edge cases
- Code duplication and DRY violations

> **Load references/code-quality-checklist.md** for detailed quality criteria, common issues, and fixes with code examples

### 3. Performance Review

Assess rendering efficiency, resource loading, and Core Web Vitals:

**Focus Areas:**

- Rendering optimization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, keys)
- Resource loading (images, fonts, scripts, lazy loading)
- Bundle size and code splitting
- Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- Memory leaks and cleanup

> **Load references/performance-checklist.md** for detailed optimization techniques and Web Vitals guidelines with code examples

### 4. Accessibility Assessment

Evaluate WCAG 2.1 compliance and inclusive design:

**Key Areas:**

- Semantic HTML (proper headings, landmarks, lists)
- ARIA implementation (labels, roles, live regions)
- Keyboard navigation and focus management
- Screen reader support (alt text, labels, announcements)
- Color contrast ratios

> **Load references/accessibility-checklist.md** for WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance criteria with detailed examples

### 5. Security Review

Identify vulnerabilities and security best practices:

**Common Vulnerabilities:**

- XSS (input sanitization, safe HTML rendering)
- CSRF protection
- Authentication token handling
- Sensitive data exposure
- Dependency vulnerabilities

**Security Controls:**

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure cookies
- Input validation and output encoding

> **Load references/security-checklist.md** for comprehensive frontend security guidelines and vulnerability prevention

### 6. CSS/Styling Review

Assess architecture, responsiveness, and maintainability:

**Key Areas:**

- CSS methodology (BEM, OOCSS, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind)
- Responsive design (mobile-first, breakpoints, flexible layouts)
- Design tokens and variables
- Specificity management
- Unused CSS detection

### 7. Testing Coverage

Evaluate test completeness and quality:

**Test Types:**

- Unit tests (component logic, utilities, edge cases)
- Integration tests (component interaction, API integration, state flows)
- E2E tests (critical user journeys, cross-browser compatibility)
- Accessibility automated tests

### 8. Generate Review Report

Create structured report with findings and recommendations:

**Report Structure:**

- Executive Summary (quality rating, critical issues, recommendation)
- Detailed Findings (by category with severity: Critical/Major/Minor)
- Action Items (prioritized with file/line references and specific fixes)

> **Load references/report-templates.md** for full review report formats and examples

## Review Process Guidelines

**Review Timing:**

- **Pre-Commit**: Automated linting and formatting
- **Pre-PR**: Self-review using this workflow
- **PR Review**: Peer review with comprehensive analysis
- **Pre-Deployment**: Final quality gate

**Severity Definitions:**

- **Critical**: Blocks deployment (security issues, breaking bugs, accessibility blockers)
- **Major**: Should fix before merge (performance issues, poor patterns, maintainability concerns)
- **Minor**: Nice to improve (style suggestions, micro-optimizations, documentation)

## Common Anti-Patterns

**React/Component Patterns:**

- Prop drilling through multiple levels
- God components doing too much
- Missing error boundaries
- Mutating state directly
- Inline functions causing unnecessary re-renders

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**

- Using `any` type in TypeScript
- Console.log in production code
- Deeply nested callbacks
- Global variables
- Unhandled promises

**CSS/Styling:**

- !important overuse
- Inline styles instead of classes
- Fixed pixels instead of relative units
- High specificity wars

**Performance:**

- Synchronous expensive operations in render
- Large unoptimized bundles (>500KB)
- Missing code splitting and lazy loading
- Unoptimized images

**Accessibility:**

- Non-semantic div/span buttons
- Missing alt attributes
- Color-only information
- Keyboard traps
- Missing focus management in modals

## Key Review Checkpoints

**Code Quality:**

- [ ] Components follow single responsibility
- [ ] Functions < 50 lines, complexity < 10
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [ ] Meaningful naming conventions
- [ ] Error handling present

**Performance:**

- [ ] Appropriate use of React.memo/useMemo/useCallback
- [ ] Images optimized (WebP/AVIF)
- [ ] Code splitting implemented
- [ ] Core Web Vitals within targets

**Accessibility:**

- [ ] Semantic HTML used
- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Keyboard navigable
- [ ] Color contrast compliant (≥4.5:1)

**Security:**

- [ ] User input sanitized
- [ ] XSS prevention in place
- [ ] No sensitive data in localStorage
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
