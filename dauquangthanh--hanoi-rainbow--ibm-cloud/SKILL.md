# IBM Cloud

Systematic IBM Cloud platform guidance for enterprise cloud infrastructure, covering compute, storage, databases, networking, security, and operational best practices.

## Workflow Decision Tree

Choose your path based on the task:

## 1. Service Category Selection

**Compute & Containers** → Load [compute-services.md](references/compute-services.md)

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Virtual Server Instances
- IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS) and Red Hat OpenShift
- Code Engine (serverless containers) and Cloud Functions

**Storage** → Load [storage-services.md](references/storage-services.md)

- Cloud Object Storage, Block Storage, File Storage

**Databases** → Load [database-services.md](references/database-services.md)

- Db2, Cloudant, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis

**Security & Access** → Load [iam-security.md](references/iam-security.md)

- IAM, Resource Groups, Service IDs, Key Protect, Secrets Manager

**Networking** → Load [networking.md](references/networking.md)

- VPC Networks, Load Balancers, DNS/CDN, Direct Link

### 2. Architecture & Deployment Patterns

**High Availability** → Multi-zone deployment across 3 availability zones
**Microservices** → IKS/OpenShift with service mesh and ingress
**Serverless** → Code Engine applications with auto-scaling
**Hybrid Cloud** → Direct Link or VPN for on-premises connectivity

### 3. Common Operations

**Initial Setup** → Install CLI, authenticate, configure regions and resource groups
**Resource Provisioning** → Use CLI, Terraform, or IBM Cloud Console
**Security Configuration** → IAM policies, encryption, network security
**Monitoring** → Set up logging, monitoring, and cost tracking

## Core Concepts

### Resource Hierarchy

```
Account → Resource Groups → Services/Resources → Access Groups (IAM)
```

### Regions and Multi-Zone Architecture

- **Primary Regions**: `us-south`, `us-east`, `eu-gb`, `eu-de`, `jp-tok`, `au-syd`
- **Availability Zones**: 3 zones per region (e.g., `us-south-1`, `us-south-2`, `us-south-3`)
- **Best Practice**: Deploy across multiple zones for high availability

### Service Categories

- **IaaS**: VPC, Virtual Servers, Block/File Storage
- **PaaS**: IKS, OpenShift, Code Engine
- **SaaS**: Managed Databases, Watson AI, DevOps Tools
- **Serverless**: Code Engine, Cloud Functions

## Quick Start

### 1. Install and Configure CLI

```bash
# Install CLI (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://clis.cloud.ibm.com/install/osx | sh

# Login
ibmcloud login

# Target region and resource group
ibmcloud target -r us-south -g my-resource-group

# Install common plugins
ibmcloud plugin install container-service vpc-infrastructure
```

### 2. Basic Resource Creation Pattern

```bash
# 1. Create VPC
ibmcloud is vpc-create my-vpc

# 2. Create resources (compute, storage, network)
ibmcloud is instance-create my-vsi ...

# 3. Configure IAM
ibmcloud iam ...

# 4. Deploy application
# 5. Set up monitoring
```

## Essential Guidance

### Security Best Practices

1. **IAM**: Use Access Groups, apply least privilege, rotate API keys every 90 days
2. **Network**: Use private endpoints, configure Security Groups and ACLs
3. **Data**: Enable encryption at rest/transit, use Key Protect for key management
4. **Compliance**: Choose regions for data residency requirements

### Cost Optimization

- Right-size instances for workload requirements
- Use reserved capacity for predictable workloads
- Leverage serverless (Code Engine/Functions) for variable loads
- Select appropriate storage tiers (Standard, Vault, Cold Vault)
- Enable auto-scaling to match demand
- Set budget alerts and monitor usage

### Reference Files

Load detailed guidance based on specific needs:

- **[compute-services.md](references/compute-services.md)**: VPC, Virtual Servers, IKS, OpenShift, Code Engine, Cloud Functions
- **[storage-services.md](references/storage-services.md)**: Object Storage, Block Storage, File Storage
