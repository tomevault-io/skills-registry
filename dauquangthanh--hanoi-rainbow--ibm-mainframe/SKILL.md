## Mainframe Development Workflow

For complete development procedures, compile JCL, version control integration, and testing strategies, load [cobol-programming.md](references/cobol-programming.md).

**Typical development cycle:**

1. Edit source code (ISPF or modern IDE)
2. Compile and link programs
3. Test in development environment
4. Version control and promotion
5. Deploy to production

**Modern development approaches:**

- Git integration via USS (Unix System Services)
- Zowe CLI for remote access and CI/CD
- DBB (Dependency Based Build) for automated builds
- Eclipse/VS Code with mainframe extensions

## Mainframe Modernization Strategies

For comprehensive migration guidance, assessment procedures, and specific migration patterns, load [mainframe-modernization.md](references/mainframe-modernization.md).

**Key approaches:**

1. **Rehost (Lift & Shift)**: Mainframe emulators on x86/cloud (fastest, minimal changes)
2. **Replatform**: Migrate to modern languages (Java, C#) with automated conversion
3. **Refactor**: Redesign as microservices with modern architecture patterns
4. **Retire/Replace**: Replace with COTS or modern SaaS alternatives

**Integration options:**

- z/OS Connect for RESTful APIs
- IBM MQ for messaging
- CDC (Change Data Capture) for data replication
- DevOps integration with Zowe, Jenkins, Git

## Best Practices

### Development

1. Use structured programming (avoid ALTER, computed GO TO)
2. Modular design with focused paragraphs/sections
3. Comprehensive error handling (EXEC CICS HANDLE, SQL SQLCODE checks)
4. Clear documentation with meaningful variable names
5. Performance optimization (minimize I/O, efficient SQL, proper indexing)

### Operations

1. Automation with JCL procedures, REXX scripts, automation tools
2. Proactive monitoring with alerts and performance baselines
3. Regular backup & recovery with DR testing
4. Capacity planning to monitor trends and forecast growth
5. Security with least privilege, regular audits, compliance

### Migration

1. Phased approach to reduce risk incrementally
2. Data integrity validation before and after migration
3. Parallel running of old and new systems
4. Maintain rollback plans
5. Extensive documentation and team training
