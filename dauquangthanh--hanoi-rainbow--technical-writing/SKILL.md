# Technical Writing

Creates professional technical documentation with clear structure, appropriate detail level, and user-focused content.

## Workflow

## 1. Identify Documentation Type

Determine which type of documentation is needed:

- **API Documentation** - REST, GraphQL, webhooks, authentication
- **User Guides** - Features, how-tos, troubleshooting
- **Tutorials** - Learning-focused with hands-on examples
- **Architecture Documents** - System design, technical decisions
- **README Files** - Project overview, quick start
- **Release Notes** - Changes, migrations, breaking changes
- **Technical Specifications** - Requirements, constraints

**For detailed templates and patterns:** Load [documentation-types-and-workflows.md](references/documentation-types-and-workflows.md)

### 2. Gather Context

Collect essential information before writing:

- **Audience** - Developers, end-users, managers, administrators
- **Technical depth** - Beginner, intermediate, advanced
- **Scope** - Codebase/APIs/systems to document
- **Standards** - Style guides or organizational requirements
- **Related docs** - Existing documentation to reference or integrate with

### 3. Structure Content

Apply clear organization principles:

- Lead with overview/introduction
- Use descriptive heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Include table of contents for documents with >3 sections
- Group related information logically
- Place examples immediately after concepts
- Add diagrams/visuals for complex workflows

### 4. Write Clear Content

Follow core writing principles:

- **Active voice** - "The API returns..." not "The response is returned..."
- **Specificity** - "Response time < 200ms" not "Fast response"
- **Define acronyms** - "API (Application Programming Interface)" on first use
- **Consistent terminology** - Same terms throughout document
- **Imperative instructions** - "Run the command" not "You should run..."
- **Show examples** - Provide code/output for every concept

**For comprehensive style guidance:** Load [writing-guidelines.md](references/writing-guidelines.md)

### 5. Add Code Examples

Code example requirements:

- Specify language in code blocks: ```python,```javascript
- Show complete, runnable examples (not fragments)
- Include input/output pairs
- Add explanatory comments for complex logic
- Test all code before publishing

### 6. Review and Validate

Quality assurance checklist:

- ✓ Verify technical accuracy
- ✓ Test all code examples
- ✓ Check clarity and completeness
- ✓ Ensure consistent terminology
- ✓ Validate all links and references

## Documentation Templates

### README Files

Essential components for project documentation:

```markdown
# Project Name
Brief description of what the project does

## Features
- Key feature 1
- Key feature 2
- Key feature 3

## Installation
[step-by-step installation commands]

## Quick Start
[minimal working example]

## Configuration
[environment variables or config options]

## License
[license type]
```

### Release Notes

Structure for version releases:

```markdown
# Version X.X.X - YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
[High-level overview of this release]

## New Features
- Feature description (#issue-number)
- Feature description (#issue-number)

## Bug Fixes
- Fix description (#issue-number)
- Fix description (#issue-number)

## Breaking Changes
⚠️ **Change that breaks compatibility**
Migration guide: [step-by-step migration instructions]

## Deprecations
- Deprecated feature (will be removed in vX.X)
```

## Quality Standards

Documentation quality checklist before publishing:

- [ ] **Accuracy** - All technical details are correct
- [ ] **Completeness** - All necessary topics covered
- [ ] **Clarity** - Target audience can understand content
- [ ] **Examples** - Working code included and tested
- [ ] **Structure** - Logical organization with clear headings
- [ ] **Consistency** - Terminology and formatting consistent
- [ ] **Links** - All hyperlinks are valid
- [ ] **Grammar** - No spelling or grammatical errors
- [ ] **Current** - Version numbers and dates up-to-date

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Assuming knowledge** - Define all acronyms and technical terms
2. **Vague instructions** - Be specific with concrete examples
3. **Missing error scenarios** - Document errors and solutions
4. **Outdated examples** - Test and update code regularly
5. **Inconsistent terminology** - Use identical terms throughout
6. **Missing prerequisites** - List all requirements upfront
7. **Poor formatting** - Use headings, lists, code blocks properly
8. **No examples** - Always include working code samples
9. **Wrong audience level** - Match technical depth to readers
10. **Dense text** - Break into scannable sections with clear headings

## Reference Files

- **[documentation-types-and-workflows.md](references/documentation-types-and-workflows.md)** - Complete templates and patterns for API docs, user guides, tutorials, architecture docs, and technical specifications
- **[writing-guidelines.md](references/writing-guidelines.md)** - Detailed style rules for clarity, active voice, specificity, consistency, heading hierarchy, code formatting, and lists
