## Checkpoint

```xml
<checkpoint>
  <verify>Worktree detected and validated? [YES/NO]</verify>
  <verify>All changes committed with user approval? [YES/NO]</verify>
  <verify>PR created with user-approved title/body? [YES/NO]</verify>
  <verify>Merge + cleanup completed? [YES/NO]</verify>
  <conclusion>{PR URL} merged. Worktree {path} removed.</conclusion>
</checkpoint>
```

</workflow>

<rules>
- Never commit, create PR, merge, or delete without explicit user confirmation.
- Never force-push. Never force-delete without showing what's being deleted.
- If CWD is not a worktree, stop immediately. Don't guess paths.
- Squash merge is default. Clean history on main.
- cd back to main repo BEFORE removing the worktree — otherwise the shell breaks.
- If merge conflicts: show the error, don't attempt auto-resolution. User decides.
- Commit messages use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.).
- PR title matches the primary commit or summarizes the branch's work.
</rules>
