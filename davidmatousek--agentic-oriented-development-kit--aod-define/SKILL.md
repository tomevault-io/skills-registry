# PRD Creation Skill

## Purpose

Guide Product Managers through creating comprehensive, industry-standard Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that serve as the foundation for superior technical specifications.

## Industry-Standard PRD Frameworks

This skill synthesizes best practices from:

### 1. **Amazon's PR/FAQ (Press Release / Frequently Asked Questions)**
- Start with the customer and work backward
- Write the press release first (forces clarity on customer value)
- Anticipate and answer tough questions upfront

### 2. **Google's PRD Template**
- Clear problem statement and goals
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Success metrics (OKRs)
- Technical constraints and dependencies

### 3. **Intercom's Job Stories**
- When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]
- Focus on context and causality, not just user roles

### 4. **Pragmatic Institute's Requirements Framework**
- Market problems (not solutions)
- Personas and use cases
- Prioritization criteria
- Success metrics

## PRD Structure

Every PRD created by this skill follows this proven structure:

```markdown

## PRD Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

Before starting, collect:

1. **Product Context**:
   - Read `docs/product/01_Product_Vision/product-vision.md`
   - Read `docs/product/01_Product_Vision/target-users.md`
   - Read relevant `docs/product/06_OKRs/` for current quarter

2. **Feature Context**:
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who requested this? (User feedback, leadership, competitive pressure?)
   - What's the urgency/priority?

3. **Technical Context**:
   - **Read `docs/architecture/README.md` for current architecture state** (what exists vs what's needed)
   - **Read `docs/architecture/04_deployment_environments/production.md` and `staging.md`** (verify infrastructure status)
   - **Read `docs/product/STATUS.md` for feature completion status** (identify recently completed features)
   - **Search git log for recent feature completions** (e.g., "Feature 003 complete", "deployed", "APPROVED")
   - Search knowledge base for similar features
   - **Identify dependencies AND verify which are already satisfied vs pending**

4. **Backlog Source Check** (optional):
   - Search GitHub Issues with `stage:discover` label for validated ideas ready for PRD
   - If validated ideas exist, present them to the user as candidates
   - If user selects a backlog item, populate `source.idea_id` in PRD frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     source:           # Automatically populated from GitHub Issue
       idea_id: null   # GitHub Issue number — always equals prd.number
       story_id: null  # Deprecated — user stories now stored in GitHub Issue body
     ```
   - `source.idea_id` is automatically set from the GitHub Issue number (resolved in Step 1 of `/aod.define`) and always equals `prd.number`
   - If user starts fresh (no backlog item selected), `idea_id` is still set to the GitHub Issue number

### Step 1b: Incorporate GitHub Issue Content

If a GitHub Issue was selected as the source (Step 1, Backlog Source Check), read its **full body** — especially `## Detail`, `## Stories`, `## Interface Contract`, and `## Definition of Done` sections. This content is the **primary input** for the PRD:

- **Issue stories** → PRD User Stories section (preserve verbatim, convert to Job Story format)
- **Issue acceptance criteria** → PRD Acceptance Criteria (preserve verbatim)
- **Issue interface contract** → PRD Functional Requirements / Integration Requirements
- **Issue Definition of Done** → PRD Success Criteria / Scope boundaries

**Do NOT generate these sections from scratch when the GitHub Issue already provides them.** Build on what exists — refine, expand, and structure into PRD format, but never drop or summarize away detail that the user provided.

### Step 2: Draft PRD Sections

Work through the PRD structure systematically, incorporating GitHub Issue content where available:

```markdown
## Recommended Order:
1. Executive Summary (write last, but placeholder early)
2. Strategic Alignment (ensures feature fits vision)
3. Target Users & Personas (who benefits?)
4. User Stories (what do they need?)
5. User Experience Requirements (how do they use it?)
6. Functional Requirements (what does it do?)
7. Non-Functional Requirements (how well does it do it?)
8. Success Metrics (how do we measure success?)
9. Scope & Boundaries (what's in/out?)
10. Timeline & Milestones (when does it happen?)
11. Risks & Dependencies (what could go wrong?)
12. Open Questions (what don't we know?)
13. References (supporting docs)
14. Executive Summary (revisit with full context)
```

### Step 3: Validate Completeness

Use this checklist:

```markdown
## PRD Quality Checklist

### Clarity
- [ ] Problem statement is clear to non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] User stories use plain language, not jargon
- [ ] Success metrics are specific and measurable
- [ ] Scope boundaries are explicit (in scope vs out of scope)

### Completeness
- [ ] All major user flows documented
- [ ] Edge cases identified and handled
- [ ] Non-functional requirements specified
- [ ] Dependencies and risks identified
- [ ] Open questions captured

### Alignment
- [ ] Aligns with product vision
- [ ] Supports current quarter OKRs
- [ ] Fits roadmap timeline
- [ ] Serves target user personas
- [ ] References customer journey maps

### Feasibility
- [ ] Technical requirements are realistic
- [ ] Timeline accounts for dependencies
- [ ] Team capacity is available
- [ ] Risks have mitigation plans
- [ ] Assumptions are documented and validated

### Traceability
- [ ] Links to product vision
- [ ] Links to OKRs
- [ ] Links to roadmap
- [ ] Links to user stories
- [ ] Links to constitution for constraints
```

### Step 4: Get Feedback

**Governance Context Loading (Lazy Load)**:

Before invoking Triad review, load governance rules just-in-time:

1. **Validate file existence**: Check that `.aod/memory/constitution.md` exists
   - If missing, fail immediately with error: "Governance file not found: .aod/memory/constitution.md - cannot proceed with Triad review"
2. **Load governance rules**: Read `.aod/memory/constitution.md` for constraints and principles
3. **Proceed with review**: Only after governance context is loaded

**Review Process**:
1. **Self-review**: Walk through PRD as if you're seeing it fresh
2. **Stakeholder review**: Share with architect, team-lead for technical feasibility
3. **User validation**: If possible, validate assumptions with actual users
4. **Revision**: Incorporate feedback, answer open questions
5. **Approval**: Get sign-offs from required stakeholders

### Step 5: Handoff to Spec Creation

Once PRD is approved:

1. **Create spec.md** using `/aod.spec`
2. **Provide PRD as input**: Reference PRD location in spec creation
3. **Validate alignment**: Ensure spec.md reflects PRD requirements
4. **Sign-off on spec**: Product Manager approves spec.md before implementation

---

## Integration with Triad Workflow

### PRD → Spec Mapping

| PRD Section | Maps to Spec Section |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Problem Statement | Background / Motivation |
| User Stories | User Stories / Use Cases |
| Functional Requirements | Functional Requirements |
| Non-Functional Requirements | Non-Functional Requirements |
| Success Metrics | Success Criteria |
| Scope & Boundaries | Scope / Out of Scope |
| Timeline | Implementation Plan |
| Risks & Dependencies | Risks / Constraints |

### Spec → Plan Validation

Product Manager validates plan.md ensures:
- Timeline aligns with PRD milestones
- Technical approach serves user stories
- Architecture supports non-functional requirements
- Tasks prioritization reflects user value

### Plan → Tasks Validation

Product Manager validates tasks.md ensures:
- Task prioritization matches product priorities
- MVP scope matches PRD in-scope items
- Task descriptions reference user value
- Dependencies align with PRD dependencies

---

## Common PRD Pitfalls

### ❌ Don't Do This

**Vague Problem Statements**:
- Bad: "Users have trouble with authentication"
- Good: "Users abandon sign-up flow at 40% rate due to password complexity requirements that don't match their mental model"

**Solution-Focused User Stories**:
- Bad: "As a user, I want a JWT refresh mechanism"
- Good: "When my session is active and my auth token is about to expire, I want to stay logged in automatically, so I don't lose my work mid-task"

**Unmeasurable Success Metrics**:
- Bad: "Users will be happier"
- Good: "NPS increases from 32 to 45, CSAT for auth flow increases from 6.2 to 8.5"

**Missing Acceptance Criteria**:
- Bad: "User can search"
- Good: "Given 1000 documents indexed, when user searches 'postgres connection', then results return in <2s with relevant docs ranked first"

### ✅ Do This

**Clear, User-Focused Problem Statements**:
- Start with user pain, quantify impact, explain why now

**Context-Rich Job Stories**:
- When [situation], I want to [action], so I can [outcome]
- Focus on causality and context

**SMART Success Metrics**:
- Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound

**Testable Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given-When-Then format for every user story

## Research-Backed Best Practices

### Sources

1. **"Inspired" by Marty Cagan** (Silicon Valley Product Group)
   - Outcome-driven product development
   - Focus on problems, not solutions
   - Continuous discovery and validation

2. **Amazon PR/FAQ Method**
   - Customer obsession starts with working backward from press release
   - Forces clarity on customer value proposition
   - FAQ anticipates objections

3. **Google's HEART Framework** (Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task Success)
   - User-centered metrics
   - Leading + lagging indicators
   - Behavior change focus

4. **Intercom's Jobs-to-be-Done Framework**
   - Context and causality over demographics
   - When-I-Want-So format captures motivation
   - Better than persona-based user stories

### Key Principles

1. **Start with Why**: Problem statement before solution
2. **User-Centered**: Always frame from user perspective
3. **Measurable**: Define success quantitatively
4. **Validated**: Test assumptions, don't guess
5. **Aligned**: Connect to strategy (vision, OKRs)
6. **Realistic**: Scope to capacity and timeline
7. **Traceable**: Link to supporting docs
