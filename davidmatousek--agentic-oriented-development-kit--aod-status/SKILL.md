# AOD Status Skill

## Purpose

Utility skill for the AOD Lifecycle. Provides an on-demand snapshot of the project backlog by regenerating BACKLOG.md from GitHub Issues and displaying a summary of items per lifecycle stage.

No governance gates — this is a read-only utility command.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Reconcile Board

Run board reconciliation to fix any label↔board column drift before generating the snapshot:

```bash
source .aod/scripts/bash/github-lifecycle.sh && aod_gh_reconcile_board
```

This compares each open issue's `stage:*` label to its board column and fixes mismatches. If the board or `gh` is unavailable, it skips silently.

### Step 2: Regenerate BACKLOG.md

Run the backlog regeneration script with JSON output mode:

```bash
bash .aod/scripts/bash/backlog-regenerate.sh --json
```

**Parse the JSON output** to extract:
- `file`: path to regenerated BACKLOG.md
- `total`: total number of GitHub Issues
- `stages`: object with counts per stage (`discover`, `define`, `plan`, `build`, `deliver`, `untracked`)

**If the script fails or `gh` is unavailable**: Display a warning and attempt to read the existing BACKLOG.md file instead. If no BACKLOG.md exists either, report that no backlog data is available.

### Step 3: Display Stage Summary

Present a formatted summary table:

```
AOD LIFECYCLE STATUS

| Stage    | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Discover | {n}   |
| Define   | {n}   |
| Plan     | {n}   |
| Build    | {n}   |
| Deliver  | {n}   |
| Untracked| {n}   |
|----------|-------|
| Total    | {n}   |

BACKLOG.md regenerated at {file_path}.
```

### Step 4: Show Active Feature Context (Optional)

If the current git branch matches a feature pattern (`NNN-*`), display the active feature context:

1. Get branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. Extract NNN prefix
3. Check for `specs/{NNN}-*/` directory
4. If found, read spec.md/plan.md/tasks.md frontmatter to show approval status:

```
Active Feature: {NNN}-{name}
  spec.md:  {PM approved / not approved / missing}
  plan.md:  {dual approved / not approved / missing}
  tasks.md: {triple approved / not approved / missing}
```

If not on a feature branch, skip this section.

## Edge Cases

- **`gh` CLI unavailable**: Warn and fall back to reading existing BACKLOG.md (may be stale)
- **No GitHub remote**: Same as above — graceful degradation
- **Empty backlog**: Display the table with all zeros
- **Script not found**: Warn: "backlog-regenerate.sh not found at expected path"
- **Not on a feature branch**: Skip active feature context section

## Integration

### Reads
- `.aod/scripts/bash/github-lifecycle.sh` — reconciliation functions
- `.aod/scripts/bash/backlog-regenerate.sh` — regeneration script (JSON mode)
- `docs/product/_backlog/BACKLOG.md` — fallback if script fails
- `specs/{NNN}-*/spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md` — active feature context

### Invokes
- `aod_gh_reconcile_board` — fixes label↔board drift before snapshot

### Updates
- `docs/product/_backlog/BACKLOG.md` — regenerated from GitHub Issues
- GitHub Projects board — reconciles mismatched columns
