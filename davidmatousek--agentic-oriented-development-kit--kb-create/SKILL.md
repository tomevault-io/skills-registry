# KB Create Skill

## Purpose

Guided pattern and bug creation with interactive prompts, automatic quality validation, and improvement suggestions. Ensures high-quality KB entries that meet institutional knowledge standards.

## Decision Tree: Pattern vs Bug

```
Should I create a PATTERN or BUG entry?

START: Do you have a reusable solution or specific error fix?
  ↓
Is this a specific error with an exact error message?
  → YES: Is the solution configuration/environment-specific?
    → YES: Create BUG entry
    → NO: Could be either - is it reusable across projects?
      → YES: Create PATTERN
      → NO: Create BUG
  → NO: Is this a general solution to a common problem?
    → YES: Create PATTERN
    → NO: Is it a design decision or architectural guidance?
      → YES: Create PATTERN
      → NO: Maybe not KB-worthy - consider documentation instead
```

**Pattern**: Reusable solutions, design patterns, best practices, architectural guidance
**Bug**: Specific errors with exact error messages, environment issues, configuration fixes

## Pattern Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Collect Basic Information

```
Creating new KB Pattern

Required fields (asterisk = required):

* Title (10-100 characters):
  → Example: "PostgreSQL Connection Pool Optimization"

* Category (select one):
  1. ARCH (Architecture & Design)
  2. DB (Database)
  3. API (API Design)
  4. AUTH (Authentication)
  5. SECURITY (Security)
  6. TEST (Testing)
  7. PERF (Performance)
  8. FRONTEND (Frontend)
  9. INFRA (Infrastructure)
  10. DEPLOY (Deployment)
  11. CACHE (Caching)
  12. MCP (MCP Servers)
  13. CLIENT (Client Integration)
  14. FLOW (Workflows)

  → Your choice (1-14):

* Keywords (min 5, comma-separated):
  → Example: postgresql, connection-pool, optimization, performance, scaling
  → Your keywords:
```

### Step 2: Define Problems Solved

```
* Problems this pattern solves (min 2, max 10):

  Problem 1:
  → Example: Connection pool exhaustion under high load

  Problem 2:
  → Example: Slow query performance due to connection limits

  Problem 3 (or Enter to continue):
  → Example: Connection timeout errors during peak traffic

  ... (continue until Enter on empty line)
```

### Step 3: Write Solution Content

```
Solution Content

Opening your $EDITOR for solution content...

Guidelines:
- Include code examples (min 3 for high quality)
- Explain root cause if applicable
- Provide step-by-step implementation
- Add validation checklist
- Link to related patterns

Template:

## Solution

### Root Cause
[Why does this problem occur?]

### Implementation
```language
[Code example 1]
```

[Explanation]

```language
[Code example 2]
```

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2
- [ ] Item 3

## Related Patterns
- [PATTERN-ID]: Description

## Tags
#tag1 #tag2 #tag3
```

Save and close editor when finished.
```

### Step 4: Add Optional Metadata

```
Optional Metadata (press Enter to skip):

Author (default: Manual):
→ Your name or agent name:

Time to solve (minutes, affects quality score):
→ Example: 120

Complexity (Low/Medium/High):
→ Your choice:

Source (where this came from):
→ Example: Production incident, Code review, Architecture discussion
```

### Step 5: Quality Validation

Automatic quality scoring runs on submission:

```

Next steps:
1. Pattern automatically indexed (git pre-commit hook)
2. Searchable via: make kb-search QUERY="connection pool"
3. Viewable in: docs/kb/INDEX.md

Would you like to:
- View the pattern? (v)
- Create another pattern? (c)
- Exit? (e)
```

**REVIEW (Score 40-59)**:
```
⚠️ Pattern Created - Needs Review

Pattern: DB-005
Quality Score: 52/100
Decision: REVIEW (usable but needs improvements)

Improvement Suggestions:
1. Add more code examples (current: 1, target: 3+)
2. Increase keyword count (current: 4, target: 8+)
3. Add validation checklist (0 items found)
4. Include related patterns (0 references)
5. Expand problem descriptions (avg: 15 words, target: 30+)

Your pattern is saved but consider improving it.

Would you like to:
- Edit the pattern now? (e)
- Accept as-is? (a)
- Delete and retry? (d)
```

**REJECTED (Score <40)**:
```
❌ Pattern Rejected - Quality Too Low

Pattern: DB-005
Quality Score: 32/100
Decision: REJECTED (below minimum threshold)

Critical Issues:
1. Too few keywords (3, minimum: 5)
2. No code examples (minimum: 1)
3. Content too short (250 chars, target: 500+)
4. Only 1 problem described (minimum: 2)
5. Time to solve too low (15 min, target: 30+ for quality score)

Your pattern was NOT saved.

To improve:
1. Add more specific keywords related to the solution
2. Include at least 1 code example showing implementation
3. Expand solution explanation with more detail
4. Describe at least 2 distinct problems this solves
5. Ensure pattern is substantive (not trivial fixes)

* Error Messages (exact text, min 1):

  Error 1:
  → Example: "Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432"

  Error 2 (or Enter to continue):
  → Example: "Error: Could not connect to PostgreSQL database"

  ... (continue until Enter on empty line)
```

### Step 2: Symptoms and Context

```
* Symptoms (observable behavior, min 1):

  Symptom 1:
  → Example: "API returns 500 errors on startup"

  Symptom 2 (or Enter to continue):
  → Example: "Health check endpoint fails with database error"

  ... (continue until Enter on empty line)

* Technologies involved (comma-separated):
  → Example: postgresql, docker, nodejs, express
  → Your technologies:
```

### Step 3: Root Cause

```
* Root Cause (20-500 characters):
  → Example: "PostgreSQL container not started before application container. Docker Compose service dependency missing."

  → Your root cause:
```

### Step 4: Fix Classification

```
* Fix Type:
  1. Configuration (environment variables, config files)
  2. Code (logic bugs, missing functionality)
  3. Environment (dependencies, system setup)
  4. Infrastructure (networking, resources, deployment)

  → Your choice (1-4):

* Difficulty:
  1. Easy (< 30 minutes, clear fix)
  2. Medium (30-120 minutes, some investigation)
  3. Hard (> 120 minutes, complex debugging)

  → Your choice (1-3):
```

### Step 5: Fix Steps

```
Fix Steps

Opening your $EDITOR for detailed fix steps...

Guidelines:
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Include exact commands or code changes
- Explain why the fix works
- Add verification steps

Template:

## Fix Steps

### Immediate Fix

1. Stop the application:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

2. Update docker-compose.yml to add dependency:
```yaml
services:
  app:
    depends_on:
      - db
    # ... rest of config
```

3. Restart with correct order:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Verification

```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose ps

# Check application connects successfully
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Prevention

Add health check to docker-compose.yml to ensure DB is ready before app starts.

Save and close editor when finished.
```

### Step 6: Bug Entry Created

```
✅ Bug Entry Created Successfully!

Bug ID: BUG-003
Title: PostgreSQL Connection Refused - ECONNREFUSED
File: docs/kb/bugs/BUG-003-postgresql-connection-refused.md

Your bug fix is documented and searchable.

Search examples:
- make kb-search QUERY="ECONNREFUSED"
- make kb-search QUERY="PostgreSQL connection"
- make kb-search QUERY="docker database startup"

Would you like to:
- View the bug entry? (v)
- Create another bug entry? (c)
- Exit? (e)
