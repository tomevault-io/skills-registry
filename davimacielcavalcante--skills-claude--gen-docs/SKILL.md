# Generate Documentation

Create or update documentation for the specified code or project.

## Detect What's Needed

1. Read the target (file, module, or full project)
2. Determine what's missing:
   - No README.md → generate full README
   - Functions without docstrings → add docstrings
   - No CONTRIBUTING.md → generate contributing guide
   - Outdated README → update based on current code

## README Template (for projects)

Follow this structure. Tone: professional but with personality. Include a Star Wars reference near the end.

```markdown
# {Project Name} {emoji}

{One-line description of what it does and why it exists.}

## Overview

{2-3 sentences explaining the problem this solves and the approach taken.}

## Tech Stack

{List as a simple inline list, not a badge wall.}

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

{What needs to be installed first.}

### Installation

\`\`\`bash
{Exact commands to get running from zero.}
\`\`\`

### Usage

\`\`\`python
{Minimal working example.}
\`\`\`

## Architecture

{Brief explanation + ASCII diagram if helpful.}

## Running Tests

\`\`\`bash
pytest -v
\`\`\`

## Contributing

{Brief instructions or link to CONTRIBUTING.md.}

## License

MIT License — see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

```

## README Template (for PyO3/maturin libraries)

Same as above but include:
- Installation section with `pip install {name}` AND `maturin develop`
- Benchmarks section comparing Python vs Rust performance
- "Why Rust?" section explaining the performance rationale
- Badge for PyPI version if published

## Docstring Style

Use NumPy-style docstrings (NEVER Google-style):

```python
def process_batch(items: list[str], batch_size: int = 150) -> list[str]:
    """Process a list of items in batches.

    Splits the input into chunks of ``batch_size`` and processes each
    chunk in parallel using rayon on the Rust side.

    Parameters
    ----------
    items : list[str]
        Raw items to process.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Number of items per batch, by default 150.

    Returns
    -------
    list[str]
        Processed items as a flat list.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``batch_size`` is less than 1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> process_batch(["hello", "world"])
    ["HELLO", "WORLD"]
    """
```

## Rules

1. **Language**: English for open-source projects, Portuguese for internal/academic projects
2. **No badge walls**: Use badges sparingly (status, Python version, license — max 3)
3. **Working examples**: Every code block in the README must actually work
4. **Keep it scannable**: Someone should get the gist in 30 seconds
5. **Update, don't rewrite**: When updating existing docs, preserve the author's voice and structure

## After Generating

1. Read the output and verify code examples are correct
2. Check all links resolve
3. Verify the project structure described matches the actual structure
