# Quality Metrics

## Test Coverage Metrics

### Code Coverage Types
- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of executable lines executed
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of conditional branches taken
- **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions/methods called
- **Statement Coverage**: Percentage of statements executed
- **Condition Coverage**: Percentage of boolean sub-conditions evaluated

### Coverage Targets
```
Critical Business Logic: 90-100%
Core Application Code: 80-90%
Utility/Helper Code: 70-80%
Configuration/Setup Code: 50-70%
```

### Coverage Tools
- **JavaScript**: Istanbul, nyc, Jest coverage
- **Python**: pytest-cov, coverage.py
- **Java**: JaCoCo, Cobertura
- **.NET**: dotCover, Coverlet
- **Go**: go test -cover

### Coverage Best Practices
- Focus on meaningful coverage, not just percentage
- Prioritize coverage of critical paths
- Track coverage trends over time
- Set coverage gates in CI/CD
- Review uncovered code regularly

## Code Quality Metrics

### Cyclomatic Complexity
- Measures code complexity based on control flow
- Higher complexity = harder to test and maintain
- Target: < 10 per function/method

```
Complexity Levels:
1-10: Simple, low risk
11-20: Moderate complexity, medium risk
21-50: High complexity, high risk
50+: Very high complexity, very high risk
```

### Maintainability Index
- Composite metric combining complexity, volume, and structure
- Scale: 0-100 (higher is better)
- Target: > 70

```
Maintainability Levels:
85-100: Highly maintainable
70-84: Moderately maintainable
50-69: Difficult to maintain
0-49: Very difficult to maintain
```

### Code Duplication
- Percentage of duplicated code
- Target: < 5%
- High duplication indicates need for refactoring

### Code Smells
- **Long Methods**: Methods > 50 lines
- **Large Classes**: Classes > 500 lines
- **Deep Nesting**: Nesting > 4 levels
- **Long Parameter Lists**: > 4 parameters
- **Feature Envy**: Methods using other objects more than their own

### Technical Debt Ratio
```
Technical Debt Ratio = Cost to Fix Issues / Cost to Develop New Features
Target: < 5%
```

## Defect Metrics

### Defect Density
- Defects per thousand lines of code (KLOC)
- Defects per function point
- Defects per module/component

```
Defect Density = Total Defects / Size Metric (KLOC, FP)
Target: < 1 defect per KLOC
```

### Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE)
- Percentage of defects found before release
- Higher is better

```
DRE = (Defects Found Before Release / Total Defects) × 100
Target: > 90%
```

### Defect Leakage
- Percentage of defects found after release
- Lower is better

```
Defect Leakage = (Defects Found After Release / Total Defects) × 100
Target: < 10%
```

### Defect Age
- Time from defect introduction to detection
- Time from defect detection to resolution

```
Defect Age = Detection Date - Introduction Date
Resolution Time = Resolution Date - Detection Date
Target: < 7 days for critical defects
```

### Defect Severity Distribution
- **Critical**: System failure, data loss
- **High**: Major functionality broken
- **Medium**: Minor functionality broken
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, typos

### Defect Trend Analysis
- Track defects over time
- Identify patterns and trends
- Correlate with code changes
- Predict future defect rates
