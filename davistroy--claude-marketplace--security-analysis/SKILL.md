# Security Analysis Framework

Perform a comprehensive security vulnerability scan and analysis of the current project. Identifies the technology stack, scans for vulnerabilities in source code and dependencies, assesses real-world risk with context-aware analysis, and produces an actionable remediation roadmap.

## Input Validation

**Optional Arguments:**
- `<path>` - Directory or file path to analyze (defaults to current working directory)
- `--quick` - Surface scan only: technology detection, dependency audit, and top-level code patterns. Skips deep taint analysis and fuzzing methodology review.
- `--dependencies-only` - Only check dependency vulnerabilities (skip source code analysis)

**Usage:**
```text
/security-analysis                          # Full scan of current project
/security-analysis src/                     # Scan specific directory
/security-analysis --quick                  # Fast surface-level scan
/security-analysis --dependencies-only      # Dependencies only
```

## Proactive Triggers

Suggest this skill when:
1. The user mentions security, vulnerabilities, CVEs, or audit
2. After scaffolding a new project with `/scaffold-plugin` or similar
3. Before a release, deployment, or merge to production
4. When reviewing code that handles authentication, authorization, or user input
5. When the user adds or updates dependencies (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
6. After cloning or pulling a new/unfamiliar repository

## Performance

| Scan Mode | Expected Duration | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Quick (`--quick`) | 1-3 minutes | Technology detection, dependency audit, surface-level code patterns |
| Full scan | 5-15 minutes | Deep taint analysis, data flow tracing, comprehensive code review |
| Dependencies-only (`--dependencies-only`) | 1-2 minutes | Native audit tools and known CVE checks |

Duration scales with codebase size (file count and total LOC). Web searches for CVE verification add latency when network-dependent lookups are required.

## Core Security Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Discovery and Reconnaissance

1. **Technology Stack Detection**: Identify languages, frameworks, and dependencies by scanning for manifest files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.)
2. **Attack Surface Mapping**: Enumerate all entry points (APIs, forms, file uploads, CLI arguments, environment variables)
3. **Dependency Inventory**: List all direct and transitive dependencies with version numbers
4. **Configuration Review**: Check for security-relevant configurations (CORS, CSP, auth settings)

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Scanning

#### A. Static Code Analysis

Scan source code for OWASP Top 10 and common vulnerability patterns:
- **Injection Vulnerabilities**: SQL, NoSQL, Command, LDAP, XPath, Template injection
- **Broken Authentication**: Weak password policies, session fixation, credential storage
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Hardcoded secrets, unencrypted data, logging sensitive info
- **XML External Entities (XXE)**: Unsafe XML parsing
- **Broken Access Control**: Missing authorization checks, IDOR vulnerabilities
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Default credentials, unnecessary features enabled
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Reflected, Stored, DOM-based
- **Insecure Deserialization**: Unsafe object deserialization
- **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Outdated dependencies
- **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**: Missing security event logging

#### B. Dependency Vulnerability Analysis

**IMPORTANT**: Always run native security audit tools FIRST before web search for faster and more accurate results.

For each dependency:
1. **Extract Version Information**: From package manifests
2. **Run Native Security Audit Tools** (Primary Method):
   - **Node.js/JavaScript**: `npm audit` or `npm audit --json`
   - **Python**: `pip-audit` or `safety check`
   - **Java/Maven**: `mvn dependency-check:check`
   - **Java/Gradle**: `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze`
   - **.NET**: `dotnet list package --vulnerable`
   - **PHP/Composer**: `composer audit`
   - **Ruby**: `bundle audit check`
   - **Rust**: `cargo audit`
   - **Go**: `govulncheck ./...`
3. **Parse Audit Results**: Extract CVE IDs, severity levels, and affected versions from tool output
4. **Web Search for CVEs** (Secondary/Verification Method): NVD, Snyk, GitHub Security Advisories
5. **Check Latest Versions**: Compare against current stable releases
6. **Assess Severity**: Use CVSS scores and exploit availability
7. **Verify Patch Availability**: Check if fixes exist and are stable

#### C. Context-Aware Analysis

For each identified vulnerability:
1. **Code Path Tracing**: Is the vulnerable code actually used?
2. **Import Analysis**: Are vulnerable functions imported?
3. **Call Graph Analysis**: Are vulnerable methods called?
4. **Data Flow Analysis**: Does user input reach vulnerable code?
5. **Environment Context**: Is this a dev-only or production dependency?

### Phase 3: Advanced Vulnerability Discovery

Skip this phase if `--quick` flag is set.

#### A. Taint Analysis and Data Flow Tracing
1. **Identify Sources**: Map all entry points (`req.body`, `argv`, `params`, `headers`)
2. **Identify Sinks**: Map dangerous functions (`eval()`, `exec()`, `innerHTML`, `SQL execution`)
3. **Trace Flow**: Trace if input reaches a sink without a sanitizer step
4. **Zero Tolerance**: If ANY user input reaches a sensitive sink without strict validation, flag as CRITICAL

#### B. Logic Abusability
1. **Race Conditions**: Identify concurrent state updates (db transactions, file writes)
2. **Business Logic**: Can you buy an item for $0? Can you access data ID+1?
3. **State Manipulation**: Can you skip a step in a multi-step flow?

#### C. Data Compromise Check
1. **Leakage**: Are PII, secrets, or internal IDs exposed in logs, error messages, or API responses?
2. **Integrity**: Can data be modified without authorization?
3. **Availability**: Can a payload cause a crash or high resource consumption (DoS)?

### Phase 4: Risk Assessment

#### Severity Classification

```text
CRITICAL (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- SQL injection in production endpoints
- Exposed secrets/credentials

HIGH (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Privilege escalation
- Sensitive data exposure
- XSS in authenticated areas
- Known exploits available

MEDIUM (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- Information disclosure
- Weak cryptography
- Outdated dependencies with patches available

LOW (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leaks
- Deprecated functions
- Code quality issues with security implications

INFO (CVSS 0.0)
- Security best practice recommendations
- Hardening opportunities
- Awareness items
```

#### Risk Factors
- **Exploitability**: How easy to exploit? (Automated, Simple, Complex, Theoretical)
- **Impact**: What's at risk? (Data breach, Service disruption, Financial loss)
- **Scope**: What's affected? (Single user, All users, System-wide)
- **Exposure**: Who can exploit? (Internet, Authenticated users, Admins only)

### Phase 5: Remediation Planning

#### Remediation Strategies
1. **Immediate Fixes** (Critical/High)
   - Version upgrades with compatibility verification
   - Code patches with security testing
   - Configuration hardening
   - Temporary mitigations (WAF rules, input validation)

2. **Scheduled Fixes** (Medium)
   - Plan for next sprint/release
   - Coordinate with feature development
   - Comprehensive testing required

3. **Long-term Improvements** (Low/Info)
   - Architectural refactoring
   - Security framework adoption
   - Developer training needs

#### Upgrade Guidance Template
```text
Package: [name]
  Current Version: [x.y.z]
  Vulnerable: YES
  CVE: [CVE-YYYY-NNNNN]
  Severity: [LEVEL]
  Fixed In: [a.b.c]

## Web Search Strategy for Vulnerability Intelligence

### Required Searches
For each dependency with suspected vulnerabilities, perform:
1. **CVE Search**: `"[package-name]" CVE [current-year] [previous-year]`
2. **Security Advisory**: `"[package-name]" security advisory vulnerability`
3. **Version Check**: `"[package-name]" latest stable version`
4. **Known Exploits**: `"[package-name]" exploit proof of concept`

### Trusted Sources
- NVD (nvd.nist.gov)
- Snyk Vulnerability Database
- GitHub Security Advisories
- npm/PyPI/Maven/NuGet security pages
- OWASP resources

## Output

**Output Location:** Write security report to `reports/security-analysis-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS].md`

## Examples

**Full scan of a Node.js project:**
```text
/security-analysis
```
Output: A comprehensive report at `reports/security-analysis-20260304-141522.md` covering dependency CVEs from `npm audit`, static code analysis for XSS and injection patterns, and a prioritized remediation roadmap.

**Quick scan of a specific directory:**
```text
/security-analysis src/api/ --quick
```
Output: Surface-level scan covering technology detection, dependency audit, and top-level code patterns for the `src/api/` directory only. Skips deep taint analysis.

**Dependencies-only audit before a release:**
```text
/security-analysis --dependencies-only
```
Output: Runs `npm audit` / `pip-audit` / native tools for all detected package manifests. Reports known CVEs with severity, affected versions, and upgrade paths. No source code analysis performed.

**Typical report summary:**
```text
Security Analysis Report
========================
Total Vulnerabilities: 7
  Critical: 0 | High: 2 | Medium: 3 | Low: 2
  Immediate Action Required: YES

Critical Findings: None
High Findings:
  - express@4.17.1: CVE-2024-XXXXX (path traversal) — upgrade to 4.21.0+
  - jsonwebtoken@8.5.1: CVE-2022-23529 (insecure default) — upgrade to 9.0.0+
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| No source files found | Empty directory or path doesn't exist | Verify the target path contains source code; check for typos |
| Project too large | Thousands of files causing timeouts | Use `--quick` for surface scan, or specify a subdirectory path to narrow scope |
| Audit tool not installed | `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, etc. not available | Report which tool is needed and provide installation command; fall back to web search for CVEs |
| Permission denied | Cannot read files in target directory | Report the inaccessible paths; suggest checking file permissions |
| No package manifest found | No package.json, requirements.txt, etc. | Skip dependency analysis; focus on static code analysis only |
| Network unavailable | Cannot reach CVE databases for web search | Use only local audit tools and static analysis; note that CVE verification was skipped |

## Best Practices
- Always verify vulnerability information from multiple sources
- Consider the specific context of the application
- Provide clear, actionable remediation steps
- Include code examples for fixes
- Link to official documentation
- Respect responsible disclosure practices
- Focus on practical, implementable solutions
