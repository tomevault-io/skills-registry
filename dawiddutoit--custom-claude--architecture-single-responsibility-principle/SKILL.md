## When to Use This Skill

**MANDATORY in these situations:**
- Before declaring architectural refactoring complete
- During code reviews for SRP compliance
- Before commits that modify class structure
- When user says "check SRP", "validate single responsibility"
- After implementing new services or handlers

## Triggers

Trigger with phrases like:
- "check SRP"
- "single responsibility"
- "is this doing too much?"
- "validate SRP"
- "god class check"
- "class too large"
- "method doing too much"

## Purpose

Automatically detect Single Responsibility Principle violations using multi-dimensional analysis: naming patterns, class metrics, method complexity, and project-specific architectural patterns. Provides actionable fix guidance with confidence scoring.

## Quick Start

See [usage-examples.md](./examples/usage-examples.md) for complete examples with expected output.

Basic usage:
- Validate entire codebase: `Skill(command: "single-responsibility-principle")`
- Fast pre-commit check: `Skill(command: "single-responsibility-principle --level=fast")`
- Validate specific path: `Skill(command: "single-responsibility-principle --path=src/services/")`
- JSON output for CI/CD: `Skill(command: "single-responsibility-principle --format=json")`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Determine Validation Level

Choose based on context:
- **fast**: Naming patterns + basic size metrics (5-10s, pre-commit)
- **thorough**: + Complexity metrics + project patterns (30s, default)
- **full**: + Actor analysis + cohesion metrics (1-2min, comprehensive)

### Step 2: Run Detection

Execute multi-dimensional detection:

1. **Naming Analysis** (ast-grep):
   - Methods with "and" in name → 40% confidence violation
   - Files named "manager", "handler", "utils" → review needed

2. **Size Metrics** (AST or line count):
   - Classes >300 lines → review needed
   - Files >500 lines → review needed
   - Methods >50 lines → 60% confidence violation
   - Classes >15 methods → review needed

3. **Dependency Analysis** (constructor params):
   - 5-8 params → warning (75% confidence)
   - >8 params → critical (90% confidence)

4. **Complexity Metrics** (radon if available):
   - Cyclomatic complexity >10 → 60% confidence violation
   - God class detection (ATFD >5 AND WMC >47 AND TCC <0.33) → 80% confidence

5. **Project-Specific Patterns**:
   - Optional config parameters → critical violation
   - Domain entities doing I/O → critical violation
   - Application services with business logic → violation
   - Repositories with orchestration → violation

### Step 3: Categorize Violations

Assign confidence levels:
- **CRITICAL (80%+)**: God classes, optional config, architecture violations
- **WARNING (60-80%)**: Long methods, many dependencies, complexity
- **REVIEW (40-60%)**: Naming patterns, size thresholds

### Step 4: Generate Fix Guidance

For each violation:
1. Identify specific issue (line, pattern, metric)
2. Suggest split strategy (actor-based)
3. Provide example (from references/project-patterns.md)
4. Estimate refactoring time

### Step 5: Output Report

Format results:
```
Single Responsibility Principle Validation Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Scope: path/to/code
Level: thorough
Files Analyzed: X
Classes Analyzed: Y

✅ Passed: Z/Y classes (P%)

❌ Violations Found: N

[CRITICAL] God Class: ClassName (path/file.py:45)
  - Lines: 450 (threshold: 300)
  - Methods: 23 (threshold: 15)
  - Constructor params: 9 (threshold: 4)
  - Complexity metrics: ATFD=8, WMC=52, TCC=0.28
  - Actors identified: 3 (persistence, validation, coordination)
  - Fix: Split into:
    * ClassNamePersistence (handles database operations)
    * ClassNameValidator (handles validation logic)
    * ClassNameCoordinator (orchestrates workflow)
  - Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

[WARNING] Method Name Violation: validate_and_save_user (path/file.py:120)
  - Method name contains 'and' (40% confidence)
  - Fix: Split into:
    * validate_user() -> ServiceResult[User]
    * save_user(user: User) -> ServiceResult[None]
  - Estimated effort: 30 minutes

[WARNING] Long Method: process_data (path/file.py:200)
  - Lines: 75 (threshold: 50)
  - Cyclomatic complexity: 14 (threshold: 10)
  - Fix: Extract helper methods for each logical section
  - Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

Summary:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Critical: X violations
Warnings: Y violations
Reviews needed: Z items

Total estimated refactoring time: A-B hours

Next Steps:
1. Address critical violations first (God classes, architecture)
2. Refactor method name violations
3. Break down long methods
4. Review class sizes for potential splits
```

## Examples

See [usage-examples.md](./examples/usage-examples.md) for complete usage examples including:
- Example 1: Validate entire codebase
- Example 2: Fast pre-commit check
- Example 3: Validate specific service
- Example 4: JSON output for CI/CD

All examples include expected output and timing information.

## Requirements

### Required Tools
- `mcp__ast-grep__find_code`: AST-based pattern detection
- `Read`: File analysis
- `Bash`: Metrics calculation (radon if available)
- `Grep`: Quick pattern matching
- `Glob`: File discovery

### Optional Dependencies
- `radon`: Python complexity metrics (`pip install radon`)
  - If unavailable: Use basic AST metrics (line counts, method counts)
- `pylint`: Additional metrics (`pip install pylint`)
  - If unavailable: Skip cohesion metrics (TCC, ATFD)

### Installation
```bash
# Install optional metrics tools
uv pip install radon pylint

# Verify installation
radon --version
pylint --version
```

## Detection Patterns

The skill uses multi-dimensional detection patterns. See [detection-patterns.md](./references/detection-patterns.md) for complete AST patterns and metrics thresholds.

Quick detection using provided script:
```bash
# Run all detection patterns
./scripts/detect-patterns.sh all /path/to/project

# Run specific pattern
./scripts/detect-patterns.sh method-and /path/to/project
./scripts/detect-patterns.sh god-class /path/to/project
./scripts/detect-patterns.sh constructor-params /path/to/project
./scripts/detect-patterns.sh optional-config /path/to/project
```

See [detect-patterns.sh](./scripts/detect-patterns.sh) for implementation details.

## Integration Points

### With code-review Skill
Add SRP validation as Step 2 sub-check:
```markdown
## Step 2: Single Responsibility Review
- [ ] Run `single-responsibility-principle --level=fast`
- [ ] Address critical violations
- [ ] Document acceptable warnings
```

### With validate-architecture Skill
Include SRP at layer level:
```python
# Check domain entities don't do I/O
# Check application services don't contain business logic
# Check repositories only do data access
```

### With run-quality-gates Skill
Add as quality gate:
```bash
# In check_all.sh or quality gate hook
Skill(command: "single-responsibility-principle --level=fast")
# Block commit if critical violations found
```

### With multi-file-refactor Skill
Coordinate SRP refactoring across files:
```python
# Identify all God classes
# Plan extraction strategy
# Use MultiEdit for atomic refactoring
```

## Troubleshooting

### "radon not found"
**Solution**: Install with `uv pip install radon` or skip complexity metrics (use --level=fast)

### "Too many false positives"
**Solution**: Adjust thresholds in detection patterns or focus on critical violations only

### "Analysis too slow"
**Solution**: Use `--level=fast` or `--path=specific/directory` to narrow scope

### "Missing violations"
**Solution**: Use `--level=full` for comprehensive analysis including actor identification
