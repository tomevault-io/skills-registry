## Quick Start

**User asks:** "Check if this class is doing too much" or "Validate SRP compliance"

**What happens:**
1. Scans code for SRP violations (naming, size, complexity, dependencies)
2. Calculates cohesion metrics (TCC, ATFD, WMC)
3. Detects project-specific anti-patterns
4. Reports violations with specific refactoring guidance
5. Estimates refactoring time and effort

**Result:** ✅ SRP compliant OR ❌ Violations with actionable fixes

## When to Use This Skill

**Invoke this skill when:**
- User asks: "check SRP", "single responsibility", "is this doing too much"
- User asks: "god class", "too many dependencies", "method too long"
- Before commit (as part of `code-review` skill)
- During refactoring or architectural review
- As quality gate (via `run-quality-gates` skill)
- When class/method feels complex but can't articulate why

**Integration triggers:**
- `code-review` skill Step 2: Architectural Review (SRP sub-check)
- `validate-architecture` skill: SRP at layer level
- `run-quality-gates` skill: Optional SRP quality gate
- `multi-file-refactor` skill: SRP-driven refactoring coordination

## What This Skill Does

### SRP Definition (Actor-Driven)

**Robert C. Martin:** "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor."

- **Actor**: A group of users or stakeholders who would request changes
- **NOT** "do one thing" (task-driven) - a class can have multiple methods
- **IS** "have one reason to change" (actor-driven)

**Example:** See [examples/violation-naming-patterns.py](./examples/violation-naming-patterns.py) for violation and correct implementation showing Employee class serving 3 actors (Accounting, HR, DBA) and the correct split into PayCalculator, HourReporter, and EmployeeRepository.

### Detection Methods (Multi-Dimensional)

This skill uses **4 validation levels**:

1. **Level 1 (Fast, 5s)**: Naming patterns via AST-grep
   - Methods with "and" in name → 40% confidence violation
   - Quick scan of entire codebase

2. **Level 2 (Fast, 10s)**: Size metrics via AST analysis
   - Class >300 lines → Review needed
   - Method >50 lines → 60% confidence violation
   - >15 methods per class → Review needed

3. **Level 3 (Moderate, 30s)**: Cohesion metrics
   - God Class: ATFD >5 AND WMC >47 AND TCC <0.33 → 80% confidence
   - Constructor >4 params (warning), >8 params (critical) → 75% confidence

4. **Level 4 (Manual, 5min)**: Actor analysis (guided questions)
   - "How many actors would request changes to this class?"
   - "Can you split by actor responsibility?"

**Default mode:** Level 2 (Fast + Size metrics) - balance speed and accuracy

### Validation Levels

| Level | Speed | Checks | Use When |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| `fast` | 5s | Naming patterns only | Quick pre-commit scan |
| `thorough` | 30s | Naming + Size + Metrics | Normal workflow (default) |
| `full` | 5min | All checks + Actor analysis | Deep refactoring review |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Determine Validation Level

```bash
# User request → Validation level
"quick check" → fast
"review this class" → thorough (default)
"plan refactoring" → full
```

### Step 2: Detect Naming Violations (All Levels)

**Pattern 1: Methods with "and" in name (40% confidence)**

Use the validation script to detect naming violations:

**Using validation script:**
```bash
./scripts/validate-srp.sh <path> --level=fast
```

**Or manually with MCP tools:**
```bash
mcp__ast-grep__find_code(
    pattern="def $NAME_and_$REST",
    project_folder="/path/to/project",
    language="python"
)
```

**Example violations and fixes:** See [examples/violation-naming-patterns.py](./examples/violation-naming-patterns.py) showing validate_and_save_user() violation and the correct split into validate_user() and save_user().

### Step 3: Analyze Size Metrics (Thorough+)

**Pattern 2: Class size (300+ lines → review)**

Use the validation script for size analysis:

```bash
./scripts/validate-srp.sh <path> --level=thorough
```

**Or use God Class detection script:**

```bash
./scripts/check-god-class.sh <file.py>
```

**Thresholds:**
- Class: >300 lines = warning, >500 lines = critical
- Method: >50 lines = warning, >100 lines = critical
- Methods per class: >15 = warning, >25 = critical

### Step 4: Calculate Cohesion Metrics (Thorough+)

**God Class Detection (80% confidence):**
- **ATFD** (Access to Foreign Data): >5 = excessive coupling
- **WMC** (Weighted Methods per Class): >47 = too complex
- **TCC** (Tight Class Cohesion): <0.33 = low cohesion

**Formula:** `ATFD >5 AND WMC >47 AND TCC <0.33 → God Class`

**Calculate metrics using radon:**

```bash
# If radon available
uv run radon cc src/ -a -nb  # Cyclomatic complexity (WMC proxy)
uv run radon raw src/        # Raw metrics
```

**See:** [references/srp-principles.md](./references/srp-principles.md) for detailed metric calculations and formulas.

### Step 5: Detect Constructor Dependencies (Thorough+)

**Pattern 4: Constructor parameters (>4 warning, >8 critical)**

Use the God Class detection script:

```bash
./scripts/check-god-class.sh <file.py>
```

**Thresholds (75% confidence):**
- 1-4 params: ✅ Good
- 5-8 params: ⚠️ Warning (consider parameter object)
- 9+ params: ❌ Critical (God Class indicator)

**Example violations and fixes:** See [examples/violation-god-class.py](./examples/violation-god-class.py) showing UserService with 9 constructor parameters and the correct split into UserAuthService, UserNotificationService, and UserAnalytics.

### Step 6: Detect Project-Specific Patterns

**Read CLAUDE.md for project anti-patterns:**

Check for project-specific SRP violations using grep:

```bash
# Pattern 1: Optional config parameters (project anti-pattern)
grep -rn "config.*Optional\|config.*None.*=" src/

# Pattern 2: Domain entities doing I/O (layer violation)
grep -r "import.*requests\|import.*database" domain/

# Pattern 3: Application services with business logic
grep -r "def calculate\|def compute" application/services/

# Pattern 4: Repositories with orchestration
grep -A 10 "class.*Repository" infrastructure/repositories/
```

**Common project-specific violations:**
- Domain entities importing infrastructure
- Application services implementing business logic (should orchestrate only)
- Repositories containing orchestration (should be data access only)
- Optional config parameters (violates fail-fast)

**See:** [references/srp-principles.md](./references/srp-principles.md) for actor identification guidance.

### Step 7: Actor Analysis (Full Mode Only)

**Guided questions for user:**

1. "List all actors who would request changes to this class:"
   - Example: "HR department, Accounting team, DBA"

2. "Can you group methods by actor?"
   - Example: `calculate_pay()` → Accounting, `report_hours()` → HR

3. "How would you name classes split by actor?"
   - Example: `PayCalculator`, `HourReporter`, `EmployeeRepository`

**Actor count → Violation confidence:**
- 1 actor: ✅ SRP compliant
- 2 actors: ⚠️ Warning (consider split)
- 3+ actors: ❌ Violation (must split)

### Step 8: Generate Report

**Report structure:**

```
SRP Validation Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Passed: X/Y classes (Z%)

❌ Violations Found: N

[CRITICAL] God Class: ClassName (path/file.py:line)
  - Lines: X (threshold: 300)
  - Methods: Y (threshold: 15)
  - Constructor params: Z (threshold: 4)
  - ATFD: A, WMC: B, TCC: C
  - Actors detected: N (actor1, actor2, actor3)
  - Fix: Split into Class1 (actor1), Class2 (actor2), Class3 (actor3)
  - Estimated refactoring: A-B hours

[WARNING] Method Name Violation: method_and_other (path/file.py:line)
  - Method name contains 'and'
  - Confidence: 40%
  - Fix: Split into method() and other()
  - Estimated refactoring: 15-30 minutes

[WARNING] Long Method: process_request (path/file.py:line)
  - Lines: X (threshold: 50)
  - Cyclomatic complexity: Y (threshold: 10)
  - Confidence: 60%
  - Fix: Extract 2-3 smaller methods
  - Estimated refactoring: 30-60 minutes

Summary:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- X critical violations (must fix)
- Y warnings (should fix)
- Total estimated refactoring time: A-B hours
- Top priority: ClassName (god class)
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick Pre-Commit Check

```bash
# User: "Quick SRP check before commit"

# Skill runs level: fast (5s)
→ Scans for method names with "and"
→ Reports 2 violations

Output:
⚠️ 2 SRP warnings found:

1. validate_and_save_user (src/services/user.py:45)
   - Method name contains 'and'
   - Fix: Split into validate_user() and save_user()

2. fetch_and_transform_data (src/utils/data.py:78)
   - Method name contains 'and'
   - Fix: Split into fetch_data() and transform_data()

Run with --thorough for complete analysis.
```

### Example 2: Class Review (Default)

```bash
# User: "Review UserService for SRP compliance"

# Skill runs level: thorough (30s)
→ Naming patterns
→ Size metrics
→ Cohesion metrics
→ Constructor analysis

Output:
❌ UserService violates SRP (src/application/services/user_service.py:12)

Violations:
- Lines: 487 (threshold: 300) ❌
- Methods: 23 (threshold: 15) ⚠️
- Constructor params: 9 (threshold: 4) ❌
- ATFD: 12 (threshold: 5) ❌
- WMC: 89 (threshold: 47) ❌
- TCC: 0.21 (threshold: 0.33) ❌

Detected actors (3):
1. Authentication (login, logout, verify_token)
2. Profile Management (update_profile, get_profile, delete_account)
3. Notifications (send_welcome_email, send_reset_email)

Recommended split:
- UserAuthService: authentication methods
- UserProfileService: profile management
- UserNotificationService: notification methods

Estimated refactoring: 4-6 hours
```

### Example 3: Deep Refactoring Analysis

```bash
# User: "Plan refactoring for PaymentProcessor - full SRP analysis"

# Skill runs level: full (5 min with user interaction)
→ All automated checks
→ Actor analysis questions
→ Refactoring plan

Questions asked:
1. "List actors who request changes to PaymentProcessor"
   User: "Finance team, Fraud detection, Customer support, Compliance"

2. "Group methods by actor"
   User provides grouping...

Output:
❌ PaymentProcessor is a God Class (4 actors detected)

Actor breakdown:
1. Finance (3 methods): process_payment, refund_payment, calculate_fees
2. Fraud Detection (2 methods): check_fraud_score, block_suspicious
3. Customer Support (2 methods): get_transaction_history, dispute_charge
4. Compliance (2 methods): log_transaction, generate_audit_report

Refactoring plan:
Phase 1 (2 hours): Extract PaymentProcessor (Finance actor)
Phase 2 (1.5 hours): Extract FraudDetectionService
Phase 3 (1.5 hours): Extract TransactionHistoryService (Support)
Phase 4 (1 hour): Extract ComplianceReporter
Phase 5 (1 hour): Integration tests and validation

Total estimated time: 7 hours
Recommended approach: Incremental (1 phase per day)
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### With code-review

The `code-review` skill invokes SRP validation in Step 2 (Architectural Review) as a sub-check. When SRP violations are detected, they are reported as warnings in the overall code review report.

**Integration point:** Automatic invocation during code review workflow with `level="fast"` for speed.

### With validate-architecture

The `validate-architecture` skill checks SRP compliance at the layer level, while this skill checks at the class/method level. Domain layers should have high cohesion (TCC > 0.5), and this skill can detect low cohesion violations.

**Integration point:** Cross-layer validation to ensure architectural boundaries maintain SRP.

### With run-quality-gates

SRP validation can be added as an optional quality gate in `.claude/quality-gates.json`:

```json
{
  "optional_gates": ["srp_validation"],
  "srp_threshold": "warning"
}
```

Set threshold to `"critical"` to block commits on violations.

### With multi-file-refactor

When refactoring God Classes that span multiple files, use `multi-file-refactor` skill to coordinate changes. This skill identifies God Classes and provides refactoring guidance; `multi-file-refactor` executes the split.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | string | `src/` | File or directory to validate |
| `level` | enum | `thorough` | Validation depth: `fast`, `thorough`, `full` |
| `output_format` | enum | `text` | Output format: `text`, `json` |
| `threshold` | enum | `warning` | Report threshold: `warning`, `critical` |
| `include_metrics` | bool | `true` | Include cohesion metrics in report |

**Usage:**
```bash
# Default (thorough mode on src/)
Skill(command: "validate-srp")

# Custom path and level
Skill(command: "validate-srp --path=src/application --level=full")

# - File size
# - God Class recommendation
```

## Requirements

**Minimum:**
- Python 3.10+ (for AST analysis)
- Read, Grep, Bash, Glob tools
- Source code in supported language (Python/JS/TS)
- Validation scripts in scripts/ directory

**Optional:**
- `radon` for accurate metrics: `uv pip install radon`
- `mcp__ast-grep__*` tools for precise AST analysis
- `mcp__project-watch-mcp__search_code` for context

**Installation:**
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Optional: Install radon for accurate metrics
uv pip install radon

# Verify installation
uv run radon --version
```

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Architectural Violations

1. **God Classes** - ATFD >5, WMC >47, TCC <0.33
2. **Constructor Dependencies** - >8 parameters
3. **Method Naming** - Methods with "and" in name
4. **File Size** - >500 lines per file

### Detection Anti-Patterns

5. **Ignoring warnings** - Small violations compound into big issues
6. **Not validating fixes** - Re-run after refactoring
7. **Skipping actor analysis** - Metrics alone miss context
8. **Assuming SRP = "one method"** - SRP is actor-driven, not task-driven

### Process Mistakes

9. **Refactoring without tests** - Always have test coverage first
10. **Big bang refactoring** - Incremental refactoring safer
11. **Not estimating effort** - Plan time for refactoring
12. **Skipping after major changes** - Validation most critical after refactoring

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Too Many False Positives

**Symptom:** Small helper methods flagged as violations

**Fix:** Adjust thresholds in `.claude/srp-config.json`:
```json
{
  "thresholds": {
    "class_lines": 400,
    "method_lines": 75,
    "constructor_params": 6
  }
}
```

### Issue: Metrics Not Calculated

**Symptom:** "Metrics unavailable" in report

**Fix:** Install radon:
```bash
uv pip install radon
```

Or use simplified heuristics (less accurate but faster).

### Issue: Can't Identify Actors

**Symptom:** Actor analysis unclear

**Fix:** Ask targeted questions:
1. "Who would request changes to this class?"
2. "Can you group methods by job role?"
3. "What teams interact with this code?"

## Expected Benefits

| Metric | Without SRP Validation | With SRP Validation | Improvement |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| God classes in codebase | 15-25 | 0-2 | 95% reduction |
| Time to understand class | 20-45 min | 5-10 min | 75% faster |
| Bugs per class | 8-12 per year | 1-3 per year | 85% reduction |
| Refactoring cost | High (embedded violations) | Low (caught early) | 80% reduction |
| Test coverage | 40-60% (hard to test) | 80-95% (easy to test) | 50% increase |
| Code review time | 30-60 min | 10-20 min | 66% faster |
