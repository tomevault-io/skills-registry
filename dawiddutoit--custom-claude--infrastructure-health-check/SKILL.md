Works with docker-compose, Caddy, Pi-hole, and Cloudflare services.
# Infrastructure Health Check

Comprehensive health verification for all network infrastructure services.

## Quick Start

Run a full infrastructure health check:

```bash
cd /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network && ./scripts/health-check.sh
```

Or invoke this skill with: "Check infrastructure health" or "Is everything running?"

## When to Use This Skill

**Explicit Triggers:**
- "Check infrastructure health"
- "Is everything running?"
- "Check service status"
- "Verify SSL certificates"
- "Check tunnel connection"
- "Diagnose network issues"

**Implicit Triggers:**
- After restarting Docker services
- After network configuration changes
- Before deploying new services
- When services seem unresponsive

**Debugging Triggers:**
- "Why can't I access pihole.temet.ai?"
- "Services are not responding"
- "SSL certificate errors"
- "Authentication not working"

## What This Skill Does

Performs 8 health checks and generates a comprehensive status report:

1. **Docker Containers** - Verifies all containers are running and healthy
2. **Caddy HTTPS** - Tests reverse proxy is serving HTTPS correctly
3. **Pi-hole DNS** - Confirms DNS resolution is working
4. **Cloudflare Tunnel** - Checks tunnel connectivity to Cloudflare
5. **Webhook Endpoint** - Tests GitHub webhook accessibility
6. **SSL Certificates** - Validates certificate validity and expiration
7. **Cloudflare Access** - Verifies authentication is configured
8. **Overall Status** - Aggregates results into pass/fail summary

## Instructions

### 3.1 Docker Container Status

Check all containers are running:

```bash
cd /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network && docker compose ps --format "table {{.Name}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Health}}"
```

**Expected containers:**
| Container | Status | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| pihole | Up (healthy) | DNS + Ad blocking |
| caddy | Up | Reverse proxy |
| cloudflared | Up | Cloudflare Tunnel |
| webhook | Up | GitHub auto-deploy |

**Check for issues:**
```bash
docker compose ps --filter "status=exited"
docker compose ps --filter "health=unhealthy"
```

### 3.2 Caddy HTTPS Verification

Test Caddy is serving HTTPS for each domain:

```bash
# Test Pi-hole
curl -sI https://pihole.temet.ai --max-time 5 | head -1

# Test Jaeger
curl -sI https://jaeger.temet.ai --max-time 5 | head -1

# Test Langfuse
curl -sI https://langfuse.temet.ai --max-time 5 | head -1
```

**Expected:** `HTTP/2 200` or `HTTP/2 302` (redirect to auth)

**Check Caddy logs for errors:**
```bash
docker logs caddy --tail 20 2>&1 | grep -iE "error|warn|fail"
```

### 3.3 Pi-hole DNS Check

Verify DNS resolution is working:

```bash
# Check Pi-hole can resolve local domains
docker exec pihole dig +short @127.0.0.1 pihole.temet.ai

# Check from host
dig @localhost pihole.temet.ai +short

# Check external DNS
dig @1.1.1.1 pihole.temet.ai +short
```

**Expected:** Returns IP address (192.168.68.135 for local, Cloudflare IP for external)

**Check Pi-hole status:**
```bash
docker exec pihole pihole status
```

### 3.4 Cloudflare Tunnel Status

Verify tunnel is connected:

```bash
# Check tunnel logs for connection status
docker logs cloudflared --tail 30 2>&1 | grep -iE "connected|registered|error|failed"

# Check tunnel process is running
docker exec cloudflared pgrep -f cloudflared
```

**Expected output contains:**
- `Registered tunnel connection` - Tunnel is connected
- `Connection ... registered` - Healthy connection

**Warning signs:**
- `connection failed` - Network issues
- `error` - Configuration problems
- No recent log entries - Process may be stuck

### 3.5 Webhook Endpoint Test

Verify webhook is accessible:

```bash
# Test webhook health endpoint locally
curl -s http://localhost:9000/hooks/health

# Test via domain (if local)
curl -sI https://webhook.temet.ai/hooks/health --max-time 5 | head -1
```

**Expected:** `OK` response or `HTTP/2 200`

### 3.6 SSL Certificate Validity

Check certificate details for each domain:

```bash
for domain in pihole jaeger langfuse ha code; do
  echo "=== $domain.temet.ai ==="
  echo | openssl s_client -servername $domain.temet.ai \
    -connect $domain.temet.ai:443 2>/dev/null | \
    openssl x509 -noout -dates -issuer 2>/dev/null || echo "FAILED"
  echo
done
```

**Expected output:**
```
notBefore=<date>
notAfter=<date>
issuer=C = US, O = Let's Encrypt, CN = R11
```

**Check certificate expiration:**
```bash
# Get days until expiration
for domain in pihole jaeger langfuse; do
  echo -n "$domain.temet.ai: "
  echo | openssl s_client -servername $domain.temet.ai \
    -connect $domain.temet.ai:443 2>/dev/null | \
    openssl x509 -noout -checkend 2592000 && echo "OK (>30 days)" || echo "RENEW SOON"
done
```

### 3.7 Cloudflare Access Verification

Check Access is configured for protected services:

```bash
# Test that Access is intercepting (should redirect to login)
curl -sI https://pihole.temet.ai --max-time 5 | grep -E "^(HTTP|location|cf-)"
```

**Expected for protected services:**
- `HTTP/2 302` with redirect to cloudflareaccess.com login
- OR `HTTP/2 200` if already authenticated

**Check Access configuration via API:**
```bash
source /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/.env
curl -s "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID}/access/apps" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_API_TOKEN}" | \
  python3 -c "import sys,json; apps=json.load(sys.stdin).get('result',[]); print('\n'.join([f\"{a['name']}: {a['domain']}\" for a in apps]))"
```

### 3.8 Generate Health Report

Aggregate all checks into a summary report:

```
========================================
  Infrastructure Health Report
  Generated: $(date)
========================================

DOCKER CONTAINERS
-----------------
[PASS] pihole: running (healthy)
[PASS] caddy: running
[PASS] cloudflared: running
[PASS] webhook: running

HTTPS ENDPOINTS
---------------
[PASS] pihole.temet.ai: HTTP/2 200
[PASS] jaeger.temet.ai: HTTP/2 200
[PASS] langfuse.temet.ai: HTTP/2 200

DNS RESOLUTION
--------------
[PASS] Local DNS: 192.168.68.135
[PASS] External DNS: resolving via Cloudflare

CLOUDFLARE TUNNEL
-----------------
[PASS] Tunnel: connected

WEBHOOK
-------
[PASS] Endpoint: responding

SSL CERTIFICATES
----------------
[PASS] pihole.temet.ai: valid, expires in 67 days
[PASS] jaeger.temet.ai: valid, expires in 67 days
[PASS] langfuse.temet.ai: valid, expires in 67 days

CLOUDFLARE ACCESS
-----------------
[PASS] pihole.temet.ai: protected
[PASS] jaeger.temet.ai: protected
[PASS] langfuse.temet.ai: protected
[PASS] webhook.temet.ai: bypass (public)

========================================
  Overall Status: ALL CHECKS PASSED
========================================
```

## Supporting Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/health-check.sh` | Automated health check script |
| `references/troubleshooting.md` | Common issues and solutions |
| `examples/examples.md` | Example health check outputs |

## Expected Outcomes

**Success (All Checks Pass):**
- All 4 containers running
- HTTPS endpoints responding with 200/302
- DNS resolving correctly
- Tunnel connected to Cloudflare
- Webhook accessible
- Certificates valid with >30 days remaining
- Access configured for protected services

**Partial Failure:**
- One or more containers down -> Restart with `docker compose up -d`
- Certificate expiring soon -> Will auto-renew, monitor
- Access misconfigured -> Run `./scripts/cf-access-setup.sh setup`

**Critical Failure:**
- Multiple containers down -> Check Docker daemon, disk space
- Tunnel disconnected -> Check internet, tunnel token
- DNS not resolving -> Check Pi-hole container, router DNS settings
- All certificates invalid -> Check Cloudflare API token

## Requirements

**Environment:**
- Docker and Docker Compose running
- Access to `/home/dawiddutoit/projects/network`
- `.env` file with Cloudflare credentials
- Network connectivity

**Services:**
- pihole container
- caddy container
- cloudflared container
- webhook container

## Red Flags to Avoid

- [ ] Do not ignore certificate expiration warnings
- [ ] Do not skip DNS checks when troubleshooting access issues
- [ ] Do not assume tunnel is connected without checking logs
- [ ] Do not run health checks without network connectivity
- [ ] Do not ignore container health status (unhealthy state)
- [ ] Do not forget to check both local and external DNS resolution
- [ ] Do not assume HTTP 302 is a failure (it's auth redirect)

## Notes

- Health checks should be run from the Pi (192.168.68.135) for accurate local results
- Remote access testing requires being outside the home network
- Certificate auto-renewal happens 30 days before expiration
- Cloudflare Tunnel reconnects automatically after brief disconnections
- Pi-hole DNS may cache results for up to 5 minutes
- Run `./scripts/health-check.sh` for automated checking
