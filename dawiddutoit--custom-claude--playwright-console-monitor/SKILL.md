# Playwright Console Monitor

## Quick Start

Monitor console errors during a login workflow:

```
1. Navigate to application
2. Execute login steps
3. Check console for errors after each critical operation
4. Generate error report with screenshots
5. Provide debugging context
```

**Immediate value:** Catch JavaScript errors during automation that would otherwise go unnoticed.

## When to Use This Skill

### Explicit Triggers
- User says "check for console errors"
- User says "monitor JavaScript errors during [workflow]"
- User says "validate error-free execution"
- User says "debug this workflow"
- User requests "console monitoring"

### Implicit Triggers
- Executing critical browser workflows (checkout, form submission, data operations)
- Testing new features or deployments
- Debugging intermittent failures
- Validating application health
- QA automation scenarios

### Debugging Context
- When workflows fail without obvious cause
- When investigating "works for me" issues
- When validating frontend error handling
- When checking third-party script integration

## What This Skill Does

This skill wraps browser automation workflows with console monitoring to:

1. **Proactive Error Detection** - Catch JavaScript errors during workflow execution
2. **Error Categorization** - Classify errors by severity (critical/warning/info/debug)
3. **Context Capture** - Take screenshots and snapshots at error states
4. **Report Generation** - Provide structured error reports with debugging context
5. **Continuous Monitoring** - Check console after each critical operation

## Console Error Monitoring Workflow

### 3.1 Setup and Navigation

**Step 1: Navigate to application**
```
Use: mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
- Navigate to target URL
- Wait for page load
```

**Step 2: Clear initial console messages (optional)**
```
Use: mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages
- Read and discard initial load messages
- Establishes clean baseline for workflow monitoring
```

### 3.2 Execute with Monitoring

**Step 3: Execute workflow with checkpoints**

For each critical operation:
1. Execute the action (click, type, navigate)
2. Wait for expected state
3. Check console messages
4. Log any new errors/warnings

**Example pattern:**
```
Action: Click "Submit Order" button
  → mcp__playwright__browser_click
Wait: Order confirmation appears
  → mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for
Check: Console errors
  → mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages({ level: "error" })
```

**Critical operation checkpoints:**
- Form submissions
- Navigation between pages
- AJAX/fetch requests
- Third-party script loads
- Authentication flows
- Payment processing
- Data mutations

### 3.3 Error Detection and Categorization

**Step 4: Categorize detected errors**

Use console message levels to filter:

| Level | Includes | When to Use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `error` | Critical errors only | After critical operations (checkout, submit) |
| `warning` | Warnings + errors | During form validation, feature usage |
| `info` | Info + warnings + errors | General workflow monitoring |
| `debug` | All messages | Detailed debugging scenarios |

**Step 5: Capture error context**

For each error detected:
1. Take screenshot of current state
   ```
   mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot
   ```
2. Capture page snapshot
   ```
   mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
   ```
3. Record error message, timestamp, and operation

### 3.4 Report Generation

**Step 6: Generate structured error report**

Report format:
```
Console Error Report
====================

Workflow: [workflow name]
Executed: [timestamp]
Total Errors: [count]

Critical Errors (level: error):
  - [timestamp] [message]
    Context: [operation that triggered]
    Screenshot: [filename]

Warnings (level: warning):
  - [timestamp] [message]
    Context: [operation that triggered]

Info Messages:
  - [summary if relevant]

Debugging Context:
  - URL at time of error
  - Page snapshot
  - Network state (if available via browser_network_requests)

Recommendations:
  - [specific debugging suggestions]
```

## Console Message Levels

Playwright console messages follow browser console API levels:

**error** - Critical errors that prevent functionality
- Uncaught exceptions
- Failed network requests (4xx/5xx from critical APIs)
- Missing required resources
- **Use after:** Checkout, payment, form submission, authentication

**warning** - Non-fatal issues that may cause problems
- Deprecated API usage
- Failed optional resources
- Validation warnings
- **Use after:** Form interactions, navigation, feature usage

**info** - Informational messages
- Application lifecycle events
- Successful operations
- Debug information from application
- **Use for:** General monitoring, understanding application flow

**debug** - Verbose debugging output
- All console.log, console.debug calls
- Framework/library debug messages
- **Use for:** Deep debugging, understanding detailed behavior

**Default recommendation:** Use `level: "error"` after critical operations, `level: "warning"` for general monitoring.

## Supporting Files

This skill includes:

- **references/playwright-console-api.md** - Detailed Playwright console API reference, message formats, and advanced patterns
- **examples/examples.md** - 5+ real-world monitoring scenarios (e-commerce checkout, form submission, SPA navigation, authentication, third-party integrations)
- **assets/error-report-template.md** - Template for structured error reports

## Expected Outcomes

### Successful Monitoring (No Errors)
```
✅ Console Monitoring Complete

Workflow: User Login Flow
Operations Monitored: 5
Console Errors: 0
Warnings: 0

All operations completed without console errors.
```

### Error Detection
```
❌ Console Errors Detected

Workflow: Checkout Process
Operations Monitored: 8
Console Errors: 2 critical, 1 warning

Critical Errors:
  1. [14:32:15] Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'total' of undefined
     Context: After "Apply Discount Code" click
     Screenshot: checkout-error-1.png

  2. [14:32:18] Failed to load resource: POST /api/payment 500
     Context: After "Submit Payment" click
     Screenshot: checkout-error-2.png

Warnings:
  1. [14:32:10] [Deprecation] Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread
     Context: During address validation

Debugging Recommendations:
  - Investigate cart.total property initialization
  - Check /api/payment endpoint for server errors
  - Review discount code application logic
```

## Red Flags to Avoid

- [ ] **Checking console only at end** - Check after each critical operation
- [ ] **Ignoring warnings** - Warnings often predict future critical errors
- [ ] **Not capturing context** - Always take screenshots at error states
- [ ] **Wrong severity level** - Use `error` level for critical operations
- [ ] **Skipping wait states** - Ensure operations complete before checking console
- [ ] **Not clearing initial messages** - Page load messages contaminate workflow monitoring
- [ ] **Missing operation context** - Always note which operation triggered errors
- [ ] **Overly verbose monitoring** - Don't check console after every single action
- [ ] **Ignoring network correlation** - Console errors often correlate with network failures
- [ ] **Not providing recommendations** - Error reports should suggest debugging steps

## Notes

**Key Principles:**
1. **Monitor critical operations** - Focus on checkout, submit, auth, payment
2. **Categorize by severity** - Use appropriate console levels
3. **Capture rich context** - Screenshots + snapshots + messages
4. **Provide actionable reports** - Include debugging recommendations
5. **Balance coverage vs noise** - Strategic checkpoints, not every action

**Console Message Persistence:**
- Messages accumulate during page lifetime
- Page navigation clears console (new document)
- Consider clearing messages between checkpoints for clarity

**Performance Considerations:**
- Console checks add minimal overhead (~100-200ms)
- Screenshot capture is slower (~500ms-1s)
- Balance monitoring thoroughness with workflow speed

**Common Patterns:**
- **Critical operations:** Check `level: "error"` immediately after
- **Form workflows:** Check `level: "warning"` after validation
- **Debugging:** Use `level: "info"` or `level: "debug"` for full visibility
- **Regression testing:** Establish baseline, detect new errors

**Integration with Network Monitoring:**
- Combine with `browser_network_requests` for complete debugging context
- Network failures often manifest as console errors
- 500-series responses typically generate console errors
- CORS issues appear in console, not network tab
