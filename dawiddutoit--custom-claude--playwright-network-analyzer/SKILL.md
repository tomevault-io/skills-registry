# Playwright Network Analyzer

## Quick Start

Analyze network traffic during a user login flow:

```
You: "Analyze network requests during login to example.com with user@test.com"

Claude invokes playwright-network-analyzer skill:
1. Navigates to example.com/login
2. Clears previous network requests
3. Fills login form and submits
4. Captures all network requests
5. Generates report showing:
   - 2 failed API calls (401, 500)
   - 3 slow requests (>1s)
   - Total: 15 requests (8 API, 7 static)
```

## When to Use This Skill

### Explicit Triggers
- "Analyze network requests during [workflow]"
- "Check API calls on [page/feature]"
- "Monitor network traffic while [action]"
- "Debug API errors in [feature]"
- "Performance analysis for [user flow]"
- "Show me network activity when [scenario]"

### Implicit Triggers
- Investigating why a feature fails intermittently
- Checking if API endpoints return expected status codes
- Validating third-party integrations (analytics, CDNs)
- Verifying authentication flows
- Debugging CORS or network errors

### Debugging Triggers
- "Why is this page slow?"
- "Is the API call working?"
- "Are there failed requests?"
- "What endpoints are being called?"

## What This Skill Does

1. **Automated Network Monitoring** - Captures all HTTP requests during browser workflows
2. **Request Categorization** - Separates API calls from static resources (images, CSS, JS)
3. **Error Detection** - Identifies failed requests (4xx, 5xx status codes)
4. **Performance Analysis** - Flags slow requests (>1s response time)
5. **Pattern Recognition** - Detects repeated requests, missing resources, CORS issues
6. **Structured Reporting** - Generates categorized reports with actionable insights

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Application

Use `browser_navigate` to load the target page:

```
Navigate to: https://app.example.com/dashboard
Wait for page load completion
```

### Step 2: Clear Previous Network Requests

Call `browser_network_requests` to establish baseline:

```
Action: Read and clear existing requests
Purpose: Start with clean slate for accurate analysis
```

### Step 3: Execute User Workflow

Perform the user actions to monitor:

```
Examples:
- Click login button → Fill form → Submit
- Navigate to products → Add to cart → Checkout
- Upload file → Wait for processing → Download result
- Search → Filter results → Click item
```

Use these tools as needed:
- `browser_click` - Click buttons, links, elements
- `browser_fill_form` - Enter form data
- `browser_type` - Type text into inputs
- `browser_wait_for` - Wait for elements or text

### Step 4: Capture All Network Requests

Call `browser_network_requests` after workflow completes:

```
Options:
- includeStatic: true/false (include images, CSS, JS)
- urlPattern: filter by URL substring
- limit: max requests to return
```

### Step 5: Filter and Categorize

Use the analysis script to process requests:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_network.py requests.json \
  --threshold 1000 \
  --report report.md
```

**Categories:**
- **Failed Requests** - 4xx (client errors), 5xx (server errors)
- **API Calls** - Endpoints returning JSON/XML (exclude static resources)
- **Slow Requests** - Response time >1s (configurable threshold)
- **Static Resources** - Images, CSS, JS, fonts
- **Redirects** - 3xx status codes

### Step 6: Generate Report

Create structured analysis with:

**Summary Section:**
- Total requests
- API vs static breakdown
- Error count
- Slow request count

**Failed Requests:**
```
❌ POST /api/auth/login - 401 Unauthorized (250ms)
❌ GET /api/users/profile - 500 Internal Server Error (1.2s)
```

**Slow Requests (>1s):**
```
🐌 GET /api/products?limit=100 - 200 OK (2.3s)
🐌 GET /api/reports/export - 200 OK (5.1s)
```

**API Calls:**
```
✅ POST /api/auth/login - 200 OK (250ms)
✅ GET /api/dashboard - 200 OK (450ms)
```

### Step 7: Identify Potential Issues

**Common patterns to flag:**
- Same endpoint called multiple times (N+1 queries)
- Missing resources (404s for CSS/JS/images)
- CORS errors (check console messages)
- Slow endpoints (candidates for optimization)
- Unauthenticated API calls (401s suggesting auth issues)
- Server errors (500s indicating backend problems)

## Supporting Files

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic analysis
python scripts/analyze_network.py requests.json

# With custom threshold for "slow" (2 seconds)
python scripts/analyze_network.py requests.json --threshold 2000

# Filter to specific domain
python scripts/analyze_network.py requests.json --domain api.example.com

# Export to CSV
python scripts/analyze_network.py requests.json --csv output.csv
```

### references/network_patterns.md

## Expected Outcomes

### Successful Analysis

```
✅ Network Analysis Complete

Workflow: Login to dashboard
Duration: 3.2s
Total Requests: 18

Summary:
  ✅ API Calls: 8 (7 successful, 1 failed)
  📦 Static Resources: 10 (all successful)
  🐌 Slow Requests: 2 (>1s)
  ❌ Failed Requests: 1

Failed Requests:
  ❌ POST /api/user/preferences - 500 Internal Server Error (1.1s)

Slow Requests:
  🐌 GET /api/dashboard/widgets - 200 OK (2.3s)
  🐌 GET /cdn/images/banner.png - 200 OK (1.5s)

Issues Identified:
  ⚠️ Preferences API failing (500 error)
  ⚠️ Dashboard widget endpoint slow (2.3s)
  ℹ️ Large image file from CDN (consider optimization)

Recommendations:
  1. Fix /api/user/preferences endpoint (server error)
  2. Optimize dashboard widget query (2.3s response)
  3. Compress banner.png or use responsive images
```

### Analysis with Patterns

```
✅ Network Analysis Complete

Pattern Detected: N+1 Query Problem
  GET /api/products - 200 OK (150ms)
  GET /api/products/1/details - 200 OK (80ms)
  GET /api/products/2/details - 200 OK (85ms)
  GET /api/products/3/details - 200 OK (90ms)
  ... (12 more similar requests)

- Python 3.8+ (for analysis script)
- Browser with network monitoring capability

### Environment
- Active Playwright browser session
- Network requests recording enabled (default)

### Knowledge
- Basic understanding of HTTP status codes

## Utility Scripts

### scripts/analyze_network.py

Python utility for processing network request JSON and generating categorized reports.

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/analyze_network.py requests.json [--threshold 2000] [--domain api.example.com] [-o report.md] [--csv output.csv]
```

Features: JSON parsing, filtering, categorization (API/static, success/error, fast/slow), Markdown/CSV export, pattern detection (N+1 queries, CORS issues).

## Red Flags to Avoid

- [ ] Analyzing network requests without clearing previous data (baseline contamination)
- [ ] Including static resources in API analysis (skews error rates)
- [ ] Using arbitrary thresholds for "slow" without context (1s may be fast for some endpoints)
- [ ] Ignoring successful redirects (3xx can be normal flow)
- [ ] Not filtering by URL pattern when analyzing specific features
- [ ] Forgetting to wait for async requests to complete
- [ ] Analyzing network traffic without user workflow context
- [ ] Reporting all issues as critical (prioritize by impact)
- [ ] Not checking console messages for CORS/JS errors
- [ ] Assuming correlation = causation (slow request ≠ always a problem)

## Notes

- **Request timing** includes network latency + server processing + response transfer (full lifecycle)
- **CORS errors** require checking console messages (use `read_console_messages` tool)
- **Static filtering** use `includeStatic: false` in `browser_network_requests` to focus on API calls
- **Rate limiting** indicated by multiple failed requests to same endpoint (429 status)
- **Progressive enhancement** start with basic categorization, add pattern detection as needed
