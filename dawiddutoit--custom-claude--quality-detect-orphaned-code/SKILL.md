# Detect Orphaned Code

## Quick Start

Run orphan detection before marking any feature complete:

```bash
# Quick check for a specific module
grep -r "from.*your_module import\|import.*your_module" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test

# If output is EMPTY → Module is orphaned (not imported in production)

# Comprehensive orphan detection (if script exists)
./scripts/verify_integration.sh

# Check specific function usage
grep -r "your_function_name" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test | grep -v "^[^:]*:.*def "

# If output is EMPTY → Function is orphaned (never called)
```

## When to Use This Skill

### Explicit Triggers
- "Detect orphaned code"
- "Find dead code in the project"
- "Check for unused modules"
- "Verify no orphaned files exist"
- "Find code that's never imported"
- "Check for integration gaps"

### Implicit Triggers (PROACTIVE)
- **Before marking any feature complete**
- **Before moving ADR from in_progress to completed**
- **After creating new Python modules**
- **After major refactoring**
- **As part of pre-commit quality gates**
- **During code review**

### Debugging Triggers
- "Tests pass but feature doesn't work" (often orphaned code)
- "File exists but nothing happens when I run it"
- "Why isn't my new module being used?"
- "Code review found unused imports"

## What This Skill Does

This skill **detects code that exists but is never used**, preventing the ADR-013 failure mode:

**What it detects:**
1. **Orphaned modules** - Python files never imported in production code
2. **Orphaned functions** - Functions defined but never called
3. **Orphaned classes** - Classes defined but never instantiated
4. **Orphaned nodes** - LangGraph nodes never added to graph
5. **Dead code paths** - Code wired but conditionals never trigger

**What it prevents:**
- Marking incomplete features as "done"
- Moving ADRs to completed when code isn't integrated
- Accumulating technical debt (unused code)
- Confusion for future developers (why does this exist?)

**Why existing tools miss this:**
- **vulture** - Can be fooled by unit tests that import modules
- **mypy** - Only checks types, not usage
- **pytest** - Can pass 100% coverage on orphaned modules
- **ruff** - Checks style, not integration

**This skill complements those tools** by checking integration explicitly.

## Types of Orphaned Code

### Type 1: Orphaned Module (File Never Imported)

**Symptom:** Python file exists, has tests, but is never imported in production code

**Example:**
```python
# File: src/myapp/features/new_feature.py (175 lines)
def process_data(data: dict) -> Result:
    """Process data and return result."""
    # ... implementation ...
```

**Detection:**
```bash
$ grep -r "from.*new_feature import\|import.*new_feature" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test
(empty) ❌
```

**Root cause:** File created but never imported in integration point

**Fix:** Import in the consuming module

### Type 2: Orphaned Function (Defined But Never Called)

**Symptom:** Function exists in imported module but is never called

**Example:**
```python
# File: src/myapp/services/utils.py
def helper_function(x: int) -> int:  # Orphaned
    return x * 2

def another_function(x: int) -> int:  # Used
    return x + 1
```

**Detection:**
```bash
$ grep -r "helper_function" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test | grep -v "def helper_function"
(empty) ❌  # Only definition, no call-sites

$ grep -r "another_function" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test | grep -v "def another_function"
src/myapp/main.py:45:    result = another_function(5)  ✅  # Has call-site
```

**Root cause:** Function created but never invoked

**Fix:** Call the function where needed, or remove it

### Type 3: Orphaned Class (Defined But Never Instantiated)

**Symptom:** Class exists but is never instantiated or subclassed

**Example:**
```python
# File: src/myapp/models/new_model.py
class NewModel:
    def __init__(self, data: dict) -> None:
        self.data = data
```

**Detection:**
```bash
$ grep -r "NewModel" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test | grep -v "class NewModel"
(empty) ❌  # Only definition, no instantiation
```

**Root cause:** Class created but never used

**Fix:** Instantiate where needed, or remove

### Type 4: Orphaned LangGraph Node (Node File Exists But Not in Graph)

**Symptom:** Node factory function exists but is never added to graph

**Example:**
```python
# File: src/myapp/graph/architecture_nodes.py
async def create_architecture_review_node(agent):
    """Create architecture review node."""
    # ... implementation ...
```

**Detection:**
```bash
$ grep "architecture_nodes" src/myapp/graph/builder.py
(empty) ❌  # Not imported in builder

$ grep "add_node.*architecture_review" src/myapp/graph/builder.py
(empty) ❌  # Not added to graph
```

**Root cause:** Node created but never wired into graph

**Fix:** Import and add to graph in builder.py

### Type 5: Dead Code Path (Code Wired But Conditional Never Triggers)

**Symptom:** Code is integrated but the path to reach it never executes

**Example:**
```python
# In builder.py
if settings.enable_experimental_features:  # Never True in production
    graph.add_node("experimental", experimental_node)
```

**Detection:**
```bash
# Check configuration
$ grep "enable_experimental_features" .env
# Not set (defaults to False)

# Check logs for execution
$ grep "experimental" logs/*.log
(empty) ❌  # Never executes
```

**Root cause:** Conditional never true in practice

**Fix:** Enable the condition or remove the dead path

## Detection Methods

### Method 1: Manual Grep (Quick Check)

**For a specific module:**
```bash
# Check if module is imported
grep -r "from.*MODULE_NAME import\|import.*MODULE_NAME" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test

# Expected: At least one import line from production code
# If empty: Module is orphaned
```

**For a specific function:**
```bash
# Check if function is called
grep -r "FUNCTION_NAME" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test | grep -v "def FUNCTION_NAME"

# Expected: At least one call-site
# If empty: Function is orphaned
```

**For a specific class:**
```bash
# Check if class is instantiated
grep -r "CLASS_NAME(" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test | grep -v "class CLASS_NAME"

# Expected: At least one instantiation
# If empty: Class is orphaned
```

### Method 2: Comprehensive Script (Automated)

**Script: `scripts/verify_integration.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Detects orphaned modules (created but never imported in production)

set -e

echo "=== Orphan Detection ==="

RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
NC='\033[0m'

orphaned=0
checked=0

for file in $(find src/ -name "*.py" -type f | sort); do
    module=$(basename "$file" .py)
    dir=$(dirname "$file")

    # Skip special files
    [[ "$module" == "__init__" ]] && continue
    [[ "$module" == "__main__" ]] && continue
    [[ "$module" == "main" ]] && continue
    [[ "$module" == *"test"* ]] && continue

    checked=$((checked + 1))

    # Check if module is imported (excluding self and tests)
    imports=$(grep -r -E "import\s+.*\b${module}\b|from\s+.*\b${module}\b\s+import" src/ \
              --include="*.py" 2>/dev/null | \
              grep -v "$file" | \
              grep -v "test_" | \
              grep -v "__pycache__" | \
              wc -l | tr -d ' ')

    if [ "$imports" -eq 0 ]; then
        # Check if exported via __init__.py
        init_file="$dir/__init__.py"
        init_export=0
        if [ -f "$init_file" ]; then
            init_export=$(grep -c "\b$module\b" "$init_file" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
        fi

        if [ "$init_export" -eq 0 ]; then
            echo -e "${YELLOW}⚠️  ORPHANED:${NC} $file"
            echo "   No production imports found"
            orphaned=$((orphaned + 1))
        fi
    fi
done

echo ""
echo "=== Results ==="
echo "Modules checked: $checked"

if [ $orphaned -gt 0 ]; then
    echo -e "${RED}❌ ERROR: $orphaned orphaned module(s) found${NC}"
    echo ""
    echo "These files exist but are never imported in production code."
    echo "Either wire them up or remove them."
    exit 1
fi

echo -e "${GREEN}✅ All modules are integrated${NC}"
exit 0
```

### Method 3: Integration Test (LangGraph-Specific)

**Test: `tests/integration/test_graph_completeness.py`**

```python
"""Verify all expected nodes are in the compiled graph."""

import pytest
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

from myapp.graph.builder import create_coordination_graph


# List ALL nodes that should be in the graph
EXPECTED_NODES: list[str] = [
    "query_claude",
    "analyze_task",
    "architecture_review",  # Add new nodes here
    # ... other nodes
]


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_all_expected_nodes_in_graph() -> None:
    """Verify all expected nodes are wired into the graph."""
    graph = await create_coordination_graph(MemorySaver())
    actual_nodes = list(graph.get_graph().nodes.keys())

    # Filter internal nodes
    actual_nodes = [n for n in actual_nodes if not n.startswith("__")]

    missing = [n for n in EXPECTED_NODES if n not in actual_nodes]

    assert not missing, (
        f"Nodes in EXPECTED_NODES but not in graph: {missing}. "
        f"Either wire these nodes into builder.py or remove from EXPECTED_NODES."
    )
```

## Step-by-Step Detection Process

### Step 1: Identify Candidates

List all Python files that could be orphaned:

```bash
# Find all .py files (excluding tests and special files)
find src/ -name "*.py" -type f | \
  grep -v __pycache__ | \
  grep -v test_ | \
  grep -v __init__.py | \
  sort
```

**Output:** List of candidate files to check

### Step 2: Check Each Candidate

For each file from Step 1:

```bash
# Extract module name
MODULE=$(basename "$file" .py)

# Check for imports
echo "Checking: $MODULE"
grep -r "from.*$MODULE import\|import.*$MODULE" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test

# If empty → ORPHANED
# If has lines → Check if they're from production code
```

### Step 3: Categorize Results

**Category A: Clearly Integrated**
- Multiple imports from production code
- Functions called in multiple places
- Part of critical paths

**Category B: Suspicious (Needs Review)**
- Only one import (fragile)
- Imported but functions never called
- Only imported in edge cases

**Category C: Orphaned**
- No imports at all
- Only imported in tests
- Imported but conditional never triggers

### Step 4: Generate Report

```bash
# Example report
echo "=== Orphan Detection Report ==="
echo ""
echo "ORPHANED (Category C):"
echo "  - src/features/architecture_nodes.py (CRITICAL)"
echo "  - src/utils/old_helper.py"
echo ""
echo "SUSPICIOUS (Category B):"
echo "  - src/features/experimental.py (only 1 import, in disabled code)"
echo ""
echo "INTEGRATED (Category A):"
echo "  - src/core/main.py"
echo "  - src/services/coordinator.py"
```

### Step 5: Take Action

**For Category C (Orphaned):**
1. If needed: Wire into system (import + call)
2. If not needed: Remove file
3. Update tests if removed

**For Category B (Suspicious):**
1. Review import locations
2. Check if code is actually used
3. Consider making integration more robust

**For Category A (Integrated):**
1. No action needed
2. Consider adding to integration test

## Automated Detection Scripts

### Script 1: verify_integration.sh (Complete)

**Location:** `scripts/verify_integration.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check entire project
./scripts/verify_integration.sh

# Expected output:
# === Orphan Detection ===
# ⚠️  ORPHANED: src/features/architecture_nodes.py
#    No production imports found
#
# === Results ===
# Modules checked: 45
# ❌ ERROR: 1 orphaned module(s) found
```

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - All modules integrated
- `1` - Orphaned modules found

**See:** Full script in Method 2 above

### Script 2: check_imports.sh (Focused)

**Location:** `scripts/check_imports.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check specific module
./scripts/check_imports.sh architecture_nodes

# Expected output:
# Checking module: architecture_nodes
# Production imports: 0
# Test imports: 2
# Status: ❌ ORPHANED (only test imports)
```

**Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if a specific module is imported in production code

MODULE=$1

if [ -z "$MODULE" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <module_name>"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Checking module: $MODULE"

# Count production imports
PROD=$(grep -r "from.*$MODULE import\|import.*$MODULE" src/ --include="*.py" | \
       grep -v test | wc -l | tr -d ' ')

# Count test imports
TEST=$(grep -r "from.*$MODULE import\|import.*$MODULE" tests/ --include="*.py" | \
       wc -l | tr -d ' ')

echo "Production imports: $PROD"
echo "Test imports: $TEST"

if [ "$PROD" -eq 0 ]; then
  if [ "$TEST" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Status: ❌ ORPHANED (only test imports)"
  else
    echo "Status: ❌ ORPHANED (no imports at all)"
  fi
  exit 1
else
  echo "Status: ✅ INTEGRATED"
  exit 0
fi
```

### Script 3: check_callsites.sh (Function-Level)

**Location:** `scripts/check_callsites.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check if function is called
./scripts/check_callsites.sh create_architecture_review_node

# Expected output:
# Checking function: create_architecture_review_node
# Definitions: 1
# Call-sites: 0
# Status: ❌ ORPHANED (defined but never called)
```

**Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if a function is called in production code

FUNCTION=$1

if [ -z "$FUNCTION" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <function_name>"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Checking function: $FUNCTION"

# Count definitions
DEFS=$(grep -r "def $FUNCTION" src/ --include="*.py" | wc -l | tr -d ' ')

# Count call-sites (excluding definitions and tests)
CALLS=$(grep -r "$FUNCTION" src/ --include="*.py" | \
        grep -v "def $FUNCTION" | \
        grep -v test | \
        wc -l | tr -d ' ')

echo "Definitions: $DEFS"
echo "Call-sites: $CALLS"

if [ "$CALLS" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Status: ❌ ORPHANED (defined but never called)"
  exit 1
else
  echo "Status: ✅ CALLED ($CALLS call-sites)"
  exit 0
fi
```

## Integration with Quality Gates

### Add to Pre-Commit Quality Gates

**In `quality-run-quality-gates` skill:**

```markdown
### Gate 6: Integration Verification (MANDATORY for new modules)

When the change involves new files or modules:

```bash
# Detect orphaned modules
./scripts/verify_integration.sh

# For LangGraph changes
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_graph_completeness.py -v
```

**Mandatory when:**
- Creating new `.py` files
- Adding new features
- Modifying integration points (builder.py, main.py, etc.)

**Failure means:** Code exists but won't execute at runtime.
```

### Add to ADR Completion Checklist

**In `create-adr-spike` skill:**

```markdown
### Phase 6: Integration Verification

Before moving ADR to completed:

- [ ] Run: `./scripts/verify_integration.sh` (passes)
- [ ] No orphaned modules detected
- [ ] All new modules imported in production code
- [ ] All new functions have call-sites
```

### Add to CI/CD Pipeline

**In `.github/workflows/quality.yml` (or equivalent):**

```yaml
- name: Detect Orphaned Code
  run: |
    ./scripts/verify_integration.sh
```

**Effect:** Prevents merging PRs with orphaned code

## Expected Outcomes

### Successful Detection (No Orphans)

```bash
$ ./scripts/verify_integration.sh

=== Orphan Detection ===

Checking for orphaned modules in src/...

=== Results ===
Modules checked: 45
✅ All modules are integrated
```

### Failed Detection (Orphans Found)

```bash
$ ./scripts/verify_integration.sh

=== Orphan Detection ===

Checking for orphaned modules in src/...

⚠️  ORPHANED: src/temet_run/coordination/graph/architecture_nodes.py
   No production imports found

⚠️  ORPHANED: src/temet_run/coordination/graph/task_provider_nodes.py
   No production imports found

=== Results ===
Modules checked: 45
❌ ERROR: 2 orphaned module(s) found

These files exist but are never imported in production code.

To fix, either:
  1. Wire them up (add imports and call-sites)
  2. Remove them if no longer needed
  3. Export via __init__.py if they're part of the public API
```

### Integration Test Failure

```bash
$ uv run pytest tests/integration/test_graph_completeness.py -v

FAILED tests/integration/test_graph_completeness.py::test_all_expected_nodes_in_graph

AssertionError: Nodes in EXPECTED_NODES but not in graph: ['architecture_review', 'retrieve_tasks'].
Either wire these nodes into builder.py or remove from EXPECTED_NODES.
```

## Requirements

### Tools Required
- Read (to examine source files)
- Grep (to search for imports/calls)
- Bash (to run detection scripts)
- Glob (to find files)

### Environment Required
- Project structure with `src/` directory
- Standard Python project layout
- Ability to execute bash scripts

### Knowledge Required
- Understanding of Python import system
- Familiarity with project structure
- Knowledge of integration points (main.py, builder.py, etc.)

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Do Not
- ❌ Trust unit tests alone (they can import orphaned code)
- ❌ Assume code is integrated because it compiles
- ❌ Skip orphan detection for "small" changes
- ❌ Ignore orphan warnings as "false positives"
- ❌ Rely on vulture alone (can miss test-imported code)
- ❌ Mark features complete without running detection
- ❌ Move ADRs to completed without checking orphans

### Do
- ✅ Run orphan detection before marking work complete
- ✅ Add new modules to integration tests immediately
- ✅ Verify imports exist in production code (not just tests)
- ✅ Check both module-level and function-level orphans
- ✅ Fix orphans immediately (wire or remove)
- ✅ Add orphan detection to quality gates
- ✅ Update `EXPECTED_NODES` when adding nodes
- ✅ Treat orphan warnings as failures, not suggestions

## Notes

- This skill was created in response to ADR-013 (2025-12-07)
- ADR-013: 313 lines of orphaned code passed all quality gates
- Orphaned code can exist with 100% test coverage
- Unit tests can make orphaned code appear "alive" to dead code tools
- This skill complements vulture but checks integration explicitly
- Pair with `quality-verify-implementation-complete` for full coverage
- Integrate with `util-manage-todo` (Phase 2: Connection verification)

**Remember:** Code that exists but is never imported is technical debt. Detect and fix orphans before marking work complete.
