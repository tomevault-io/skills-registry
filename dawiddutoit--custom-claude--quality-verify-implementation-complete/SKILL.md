# Verify Implementation Complete

## Quick Start

Before claiming any implementation is "done", run this verification:

```bash
# 1. Check if your new module is imported
grep -r "from.*your_module import\|import.*your_module" src/

# 2. Check if your functions are called
grep -r "your_function_name" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test | grep -v "def "

# 3. Run integration verification
./scripts/verify_integration.sh  # If available

# 4. Answer the Four Questions (see below)
```

If any check fails or you cannot answer all four questions, **the implementation is NOT complete**.

## When to Use This Skill

### Explicit Triggers
- "Verify this implementation is complete"
- "Is this code integrated?"
- "Check if my code is wired into the system"
- "Prove this feature runs"
- "Verify integration for [feature/module]"
- "Run implementation completeness check"

### Implicit Triggers
- Before marking any task as "done" or "complete"
- Before moving an ADR from `in_progress/` to `completed/`
- After creating new Python modules, classes, or functions
- After implementing LangGraph nodes, CLI commands, or API endpoints
- Before claiming "feature works" or "implementation successful"
- When self-reviewing code changes

### Debugging Triggers
- "Why isn't my feature working?" (often it's not integrated)
- "Tests pass but feature doesn't run" (classic integration gap)
- "Code exists but nothing happens" (orphaned code)
- "Feature used to work" (regression - connection removed)

## What This Skill Does

This skill enforces the **Creation-Connection-Verification (CCV) Principle** by:

1. **Verifying Creation** - Confirms artifacts exist (files, tests, types)
2. **Verifying Connection** - Confirms artifacts are wired into the system
3. **Verifying Execution** - Confirms artifacts execute at runtime
4. **Providing Evidence** - Generates proof that all three phases are complete

**This skill prevents the ADR-013 failure mode** where code was created and tested but never integrated into `builder.py`, causing the feature to never execute despite passing all quality gates.

## The CCV Principle

### The Formula

```
COMPLETE = CREATION + CONNECTION + VERIFICATION
```

### The Three Phases

| Phase | Proves | Evidence Required |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **CREATION** | Artifact exists | File written, tests pass, types check, linting clean |
| **CONNECTION** | Artifact is wired in | Import statement, registration call, configuration entry |
| **VERIFICATION** | Artifact executes | Logs showing execution, output observed, state changes confirmed |

**Missing any phase = Implementation is INCOMPLETE**

### Why All Three Are Required

- **Creation without Connection** → Dead code that never runs
- **Connection without Verification** → Unknown if it actually works
- **Creation + Connection without Verification** → Might work, might not, no proof

## The Four Questions Test

Before claiming "done", you MUST answer ALL FOUR questions:

### Question 1: How do I trigger this?
**What it means:** What user action, CLI command, API call, or system event causes this code to execute?

**Examples:**
- `uv run temet-run -a talky -p "analyze code"`
- `curl -X POST /api/endpoint`
- `from myapp.service import MyService; MyService().method()`

**If you cannot answer:** Feature has no entry point → NOT COMPLETE

### Question 2: What connects it to the system?
**What it means:** Where is the import, registration, or wiring that makes this code reachable?

**Examples:**
- `builder.py line 45: from .architecture_nodes import create_review_node`
- `main.py line 12: app.add_command(my_command)`
- `container.py line 67: container.register(MyService)`

**If you cannot answer:** Code is orphaned → NOT COMPLETE

### Question 3: What evidence proves it runs?
**What it means:** What logs, traces, or observable output demonstrates execution?

**Examples:**
- `[2025-12-07 10:30:45] INFO architecture_review_triggered`
- `✓ Task completed successfully (in CLI output)`
- `HTTP 200 OK (in curl response)`

**If you cannot answer:** No execution proof → NOT COMPLETE

### Question 4: What shows it works correctly?
**What it means:** What output, state change, or behavior proves correct function?

**Examples:**
- `state.architecture_review = ArchitectureReviewResult(status=APPROVED)`
- `Database row inserted with expected values`
- `File created with correct contents`

**If you cannot answer:** No outcome proof → NOT COMPLETE

## Step-by-Step Verification Process

### Phase 1: Verify Creation (Artifacts Exist)

Run standard quality gates:

```bash
# Type checking
uv run mypy src/

# Linting
uv run ruff check .

# Unit tests
uv run pytest tests/unit/ --no-cov -v
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Files exist with complete implementations (no stubs/TODOs)
- [ ] Unit tests pass (isolated behavior verified)
- [ ] Type checking passes (no type errors)
- [ ] Linting passes (code style clean)

**If any fail:** Fix before proceeding to Phase 2

### Phase 2: Verify Connection (Wiring Exists)

#### 2.1 Check Import Statements

For a new module `your_module.py`:

```bash
# Find all imports of your module
grep -r "from.*your_module import\|import.*your_module" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test
```

**Expected:** At least one import in production code (not just tests)

**If empty:** Module is NOT imported → NOT CONNECTED

#### 2.2 Check Call-Sites

For a new function `your_function`:

```bash
# Find all call-sites
grep -r "your_function" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test | grep -v "def your_function"
```

**Expected:** At least one call-site in production code

**If empty:** Function is never called → NOT CONNECTED

#### 2.3 Check Registration (if applicable)

For components that require registration:

```bash
# LangGraph nodes
grep -E "add_node.*your_node|from.*your_module" src/coordination/graph/builder.py

# CLI commands
grep -r "add_command\|@.*\.command\|@click\.command" src/ | grep your_command

# DI container
grep -r "container\.register\|container\.provide" src/ | grep YourService

# API routes
grep -r "router\.add\|@.*\.route\|@app\." src/ | grep your_endpoint
```

**Expected:** Registration code exists

**If empty:** Component is NOT registered → NOT CONNECTED

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Module imported in at least one production file
- [ ] Functions/classes called in at least one production path
- [ ] (If applicable) Component registered in system
- [ ] Can trace path from entry point to your code

**If any fail:** Wire the code before proceeding to Phase 3

### Phase 3: Verify Execution (Runtime Proof)

#### 3.1 Trigger the Feature

Execute the actual entry point:

```bash
# Example: CLI command
uv run temet-run -a talky -p "test command"

# Example: API endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/endpoint -d '{"test": "data"}'

# Example: Direct invocation
uv run python -c "from myapp.service import MyService; MyService().method()"
```

**Observe:** Command completes without errors

#### 3.2 Capture Execution Evidence

Look for evidence that YOUR code executed:

```bash
# Check logs for your module
grep "your_module\|your_function" logs/daemon.log

# Check structured logs
grep "your_module" logs/*.jsonl | jq .

# Check database for expected changes
sqlite3 app.db "SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE created_at > datetime('now', '-1 minute')"
```

**Expected:** Evidence that your code path was executed

**If no evidence:** Code path was not reached → NOT VERIFIED

#### 3.3 Confirm Correct Behavior

Verify the outcome matches expectations:

```bash
# Check state changes
# Example: LangGraph state field populated
assert result.your_field is not None

# Example: File created
ls -la expected_output_file.txt

# Example: Database row inserted
# (query from 3.2)
```

**Expected:** Behavior matches specification

**If incorrect:** Implementation has bugs → NOT VERIFIED

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Feature can be triggered via documented entry point
- [ ] Logs/traces show code execution
- [ ] Expected outcome observed (state change, output, etc.)
- [ ] Can answer all Four Questions

**If any fail:** Debug and fix before claiming "done"

## Verification by Artifact Type

### LangGraph Nodes

**Creation:**
- [ ] Node file exists (e.g., `architecture_nodes.py`)
- [ ] Factory function implemented (e.g., `create_architecture_review_node()`)
- [ ] Routing function implemented (e.g., `should_review_architecture()`)
- [ ] Unit tests pass

**Connection:**
```bash
# Verify import
grep "architecture_nodes" src/temet_run/coordination/graph/builder.py

# Expected output:
# from .architecture_nodes import create_architecture_review_node, should_review_architecture
```

- [ ] Imported in `builder.py`
- [ ] Node added to graph: `graph.add_node("your_node", node)`
- [ ] Edges wired: `graph.add_conditional_edges(...)` or `graph.add_edge(...)`

**Verification:**
```bash
# Add to test_graph_completeness.py
EXPECTED_NODES = [
    "your_node_name",  # Add this
    # ... other nodes
]
```

- [ ] Node in `EXPECTED_NODES` list
- [ ] Integration test passes
- [ ] Coordinator execution shows node in logs
- [ ] State field populated after execution

### CLI Commands

**Creation:**
- [ ] Command function exists
- [ ] Decorated with `@click.command()` or `@app.command()`
- [ ] Tests pass

**Connection:**
```bash
# Verify registration
grep -r "add_command\|@.*\.command" src/your_app/cli/ | grep your_command_name
```

- [ ] Command registered in CLI group
- [ ] Shows in `--help` output

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test command
uv run your-app your-command --help
uv run your-app your-command [args]
```

- [ ] Command appears in `--help`
- [ ] Command executes without errors
- [ ] Expected output observed

### Service Classes (with DI)

**Creation:**
- [ ] Service class exists
- [ ] Methods implemented
- [ ] Unit tests pass

**Connection:**
```bash
# Verify DI registration
grep -r "container\.register\|register_singleton\|provide" src/ | grep YourServiceName
```

- [ ] Service registered in container
- [ ] Dependencies injected correctly

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test injection
uv run python -c "
from your_app.container import container
service = container.resolve('YourService')
service.method()
"
```

- [ ] Service can be resolved from container
- [ ] Method executes correctly
- [ ] Dependencies are provided

### API Endpoints

**Creation:**
- [ ] Endpoint function exists
- [ ] Route handler implemented
- [ ] Tests pass

**Connection:**
```bash
# Verify route registration
grep -r "router\.add\|@.*\.route\|@app\." src/ | grep your_endpoint
```

- [ ] Route added to router
- [ ] Endpoint shows in OpenAPI docs (if applicable)

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/your-endpoint -d '{"test": "data"}'
```

- [ ] Endpoint responds (not 404)
- [ ] Expected status code (200, 201, etc.)
- [ ] Response body correct

## Common Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Created But Never Imported

**Symptom:** File exists, tests pass, but nothing uses it

**Detection:**
```bash
grep -r "from.*your_module import" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test
# Returns: (empty)
```

**Fix:** Add import where the module should be used

### Pattern 2: Imported But Never Called

**Symptom:** Import exists, but functions never invoked

**Detection:**
```bash
grep -r "your_function_name" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v test | grep -v "def "
# Returns: (empty - only the definition exists)
```

**Fix:** Add call-site where the function should be used

### Pattern 3: Registered But Wrong Configuration

**Symptom:** Component registered, but with wrong parameters/order

**Detection:** Integration tests fail, runtime errors

**Fix:** Review registration code, compare with working examples

### Pattern 4: Unit Tests Pass, Integration Fails

**Symptom:** Isolated tests work, but feature fails in real system

**Detection:** Integration tests fail, or manual testing shows errors

**Fix:** Add integration tests that exercise real dependencies

### Pattern 5: Code Reachable But Conditional Never Triggers

**Symptom:** Code is wired, but conditional logic prevents execution

**Detection:** Code never appears in logs despite feature being triggered

**Fix:** Review conditional logic, adjust trigger conditions

## Expected Outcomes

### Successful Verification

```
✅ Implementation Verification Complete

Feature: ArchitectureReview Node
Location: src/temet_run/coordination/graph/architecture_nodes.py

Phase 1: CREATION ✅
  - File exists (175 lines)
  - Unit tests pass (24/24)
  - Type checking clean
  - Linting clean

Phase 2: CONNECTION ✅
  - Imported in: builder.py line 12
  - Registered: graph.add_node("architecture_review", node)
  - Edges: Conditional edge from "query_claude"
  - Evidence:
    $ grep "architecture_nodes" src/coordination/graph/builder.py
    from .architecture_nodes import create_architecture_review_node

Phase 3: VERIFICATION ✅
  - Integration test: EXPECTED_NODES includes "architecture_review"
  - Execution proof:
    [2025-12-07 10:30:45] INFO architecture_review_triggered
    [2025-12-07 10:30:46] INFO architecture_review_complete status=approved
  - Outcome proof: state.architecture_review = ArchitectureReviewResult(...)

Four Questions Test ✅
  1. Trigger: uv run temet-run -a talky -p "Write code"
  2. Connection: builder.py line 12 (import), line 146 (add_node)
  3. Execution: Logs above show node executed
  4. Outcome: state.architecture_review contains approval data

✅ IMPLEMENTATION IS COMPLETE
```

### Verification Failure

```
❌ Implementation Verification Failed

Feature: ArchitectureReview Node
Location: src/temet_run/coordination/graph/architecture_nodes.py

Phase 1: CREATION ✅
  - File exists (175 lines)
  - Unit tests pass (24/24)
  - Type checking clean
  - Linting clean

Phase 2: CONNECTION ❌
  - Imported in: NOT FOUND
  - Evidence:
    $ grep "architecture_nodes" src/coordination/graph/builder.py
    (empty - no imports found)

CRITICAL FAILURE: Module is not imported in builder.py

❌ IMPLEMENTATION IS INCOMPLETE

Required Actions:
1. Add import in builder.py: from .architecture_nodes import create_architecture_review_node
2. Register node: graph.add_node("architecture_review", review_node)
3. Add edges to wire into workflow
4. Re-run verification after fixes

DO NOT claim this feature is "done" until verification passes.
```

## Requirements

### Tools Required
- Read (to examine source files)
- Grep (to search for imports/calls)
- Bash (to run verification commands)

### Knowledge Required
- Understanding of the project's architecture
- Knowledge of where entry points are (main.py, builder.py, etc.)
- Familiarity with import paths and module structure

### Environment Required
- Working directory is project root
- Source code in `src/` directory
- Tests in `tests/` directory

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Do Not
- ❌ Claim "feature complete" without running this verification
- ❌ Skip Phase 2 (connection) verification
- ❌ Skip Phase 3 (runtime) verification
- ❌ Accept "tests pass" as proof of integration
- ❌ Move ADRs to `completed/` without this verification
- ❌ Self-approve without answering Four Questions
- ❌ Assume code is integrated just because it compiles
- ❌ Trust unit tests alone (they can hide orphaned code)

### Do
- ✅ Run all three phases of verification
- ✅ Paste actual command output as evidence
- ✅ Answer all Four Questions before claiming "done"
- ✅ Add integration tests for new components
- ✅ Update `EXPECTED_NODES` or equivalent tracking lists
- ✅ Show execution logs as proof
- ✅ Verify correct behavior, not just "no errors"
- ✅ Document evidence in task/ADR completion notes

## Notes

- This skill was created in response to ADR-013 failure (2025-12-07)
- The failure: 313 lines of code, 46 passing tests, but code never integrated
- This skill prevents that exact failure mode from recurring
- Integrate this skill with `util-manage-todo` (three-phase pattern)
- Integrate with `create-adr-spike` (Phase 6: Integration Verification)
- Integrate with `quality-run-quality-gates` (add as Gate 6)

**Remember:** Code is not "done" when it compiles and tests pass. Code is "done" when it executes at runtime and produces correct outcomes.
