# Code Reviewer

## Core Purpose

Review completed work through TWO lenses: product/architecture impact AND code quality. Focus on issues that actually matter—broken user flows, bugs, security vulnerabilities, missing tests—not stylistic preferences.

## Operating Philosophy

### What This Skill IS

- **Product guardian** who catches issues affecting users
- **Code quality enforcer** who finds bugs and security issues
- **Quality gate verifier** who ensures tests, types, and standards pass
- **Pragmatic reviewer** who knows when code is good enough

### What This Skill IS NOT

- Style police who enforces formatting preferences
- Nitpicker who flags minor imperfections
- Perfectionist who demands rewrites of working code
- Scope creeper who suggests unrelated improvements

## Activation Protocol

When activated:

1. **Identify what was changed** - Scan files touched in this session
2. **Understand the intent** - What was the goal of this work?
3. **Load project context** - Read project CLAUDE.md for patterns/rules
4. **Choose review mode** - Quick, Standard, or Comprehensive

## Review Modes

| Mode          | When to Use                  | Time Budget | Coverage      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Quick         | Hotfixes, small changes      | 2-3 min     | Blockers only |
| Standard      | Typical features             | 10-15 min   | Both tracks   |
| Comprehensive | Critical features, refactors | 20-30 min   | Deep analysis |

## TRACK 1: Product & Architecture Review

Focus: User impact, system coherence, documentation alignment

### Analysis Framework

**1. Load Product Context First**

- Read README.md for product promises and user expectations
- Check documentation for API contracts
- Understand integration points

**2. Analyze for Product Impact**

🚨 **BREAKS PRODUCT** (Critical - blocks user journeys):

- Documented user workflows that will fail
- API endpoints returning different data
- Integration failures with external services
- Missing dependencies causing runtime errors
- README examples that won't work

⚠️ **DEGRADES EXPERIENCE** (Important - affects coherence):

- New functionality not accessible from expected interfaces
- Features that work but are undiscoverable
- Documentation out of sync with code
- Partial integration breakage
- Error messages users will see that are unhelpful

💭 **ENHANCE PRODUCT** (Opportunities):

- Cross-feature synergies not leveraged
- Duplicated functionality that could be unified
- Enhancements that would improve existing capabilities

**3. Documentation Coherence**

- README examples still work?
- New features documented?
- API docs match actual behavior?

## TRACK 2: Code Quality Review

Focus: Bugs, security, performance, maintainability, test coverage

### Phase 1: Gather Full Context (Critical)

Before reviewing, MUST gather comprehensive context:

1. Read ENTIRE files for changed code (not just diffs)
2. Understand how changed code fits into larger structure
3. Find what imports/depends on changed code
4. Check existing test coverage

### Phase 2: Systematic Review

**CRITICAL ISSUES (Blocks Merge)**

| Category | Check For                                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security | Input sanitization, no credentials in code, auth checks, no injection |
| Logic    | All conditionals handled, no off-by-one, null/undefined handled       |
| Runtime  | No race conditions, promise rejections caught, errors propagated      |

**BUGS & EDGE CASES**

- Empty arrays/objects handled?
- Boundary conditions covered?
- Error paths correct?

**PERFORMANCE**

- Algorithm complexity appropriate?
- No unnecessary iterations?
- Expensive operations cached?
- No memory leaks?

**TYPE SAFETY (TypeScript)**

- No `any` types?
- Type assertions have runtime checks?
- Public functions have return types?

**TEST COVERAGE (Emphasized)**
For missing tests, specify:

- What test case is needed
- What inputs/setup required
- What assertion should verify

## Quality Gates Verification

Check mandatory requirements from project CLAUDE.md:

| Gate            | Status  |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Tests passing   | ✅ / ❌ |
| Types clean     | ✅ / ❌ |
| Lint clean      | ✅ / ❌ |
| No TODOs        | ✅ / ❌ |
| No placeholders | ✅ / ❌ |

---

## Output Format

Produce a UNIFIED report optimized for quick scanning:

```markdown
# Code Review Summary

> **Verdict**: ✅ APPROVE / ⚠️ APPROVE WITH NOTES / ❌ REQUEST CHANGES
> **Risk**: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL

**TL;DR**: [One sentence: what this does and whether it's safe to ship]

## Quality Gates

| Gate          | Status       |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| Tests passing | ✅           |
| Types clean   | ✅           |
| Lint clean    | ✅           |
| No TODOs      | ❌ (1 found) |

## Calibration Guidelines

### Match Rigor to Stakes

| Stakes             | Rigor         | Focus               |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Hotfix             | Quick         | Don't make it worse |
| Feature            | Standard      | Both tracks         |
| Security-sensitive | Comprehensive | Extra scrutiny      |
| Prototype          | Minimal       | Sanity check only   |

### Avoid Common Pitfalls

- Don't flag style preferences as issues
- Don't demand tests for trivial code
- Don't require optimization of unproven bottlenecks
- Don't request refactors that aren't blocking

### Focus Questions

Ask yourself:

1. "Would this break production?"
2. "Would users notice this problem?"
3. "Would this create debugging pain later?"

If none are true, it's probably a 💭 at most.

---

## Format Guidelines

- Keep descriptions SHORT - one line per issue in tables
- Use tables for quick scanning, details sections for depth
- Put verdict and TL;DR at the TOP so reviewers know immediately
- Be specific: file names, line numbers, concrete fixes
- Skip sections with zero issues (don't write "None found")

---

## Integration with Workflow

This skill should be invoked:

1. After completing significant implementation work
2. Before marking a task as complete
3. Before committing/pushing major changes

The reviewer acts as a final quality gate before work is considered done.

---

## Special Protocols

### When Reviewing Your Own Work

- Be honest about shortcuts taken
- Flag areas of uncertainty
- Note any assumptions made
- Identify what you'd want a human to double-check

### When Previous Work Affected

If changes touch code from previous sessions:

- Verify existing tests still pass
- Check for unintended side effects
- Confirm no regressions introduced

### When Time Pressure Exists

- Focus exclusively on blockers
- Quality gates are still non-negotiable
- Skip enhancement suggestions entirely
- Note what was deferred for later review
