# Finding Great Candidates

Goal: Identify candidates we'd be **thrilled** to have on the team. Not "can do the job" — candidates we're excited about.

> "Our first 100 people are our cultural co-founders."

## What Makes Someone Great (Universal Traits)

These traits apply to EVERY role. A candidate missing any of these is unlikely to be great.

### 1. High Agency
**What it is**: Takes initiative. Makes things happen. Doesn't wait for permission or perfect conditions.

**How to spot it**:
- Started something from nothing (project, company, community, initiative)
- Identified problems and solved them without being asked
- Phrases like "I noticed X wasn't working, so I..." or "I proposed..."
- Built things with limited resources
- Career moves that show they created opportunity vs. waited for it

**Red flags**:
- Passive language ("I was assigned to...", "My manager asked me to...")
- No examples of self-initiated work
- Lots of "we" with no clear individual contribution
- Job history of only joining established teams/processes

### 2. Grit & Resilience
**What it is**: Perseveres through hard things. Doesn't quit when it gets difficult.

**How to spot it**:
- Shipped something hard (long timeline, technical challenges, organizational friction)
- Stayed with a problem until solved vs. moving on when stuck
- Built something despite obstacles (funding, team, technical, market)
- Career shows persistence (didn't job-hop at first sign of difficulty)
- Specific stories of overcoming setbacks

**Red flags**:
- Lots of short stints without clear upward moves
- Vague explanations for leaving ("it wasn't a good fit")
- No examples of pushing through difficulty
- Blame-shifting to circumstances

### 3. Evidence of Impact
**What it is**: Demonstrable results. Outcomes, not just activities.

**How to spot it**:
- Metrics at ANY scale: "10x'd revenue", "reduced costs 60%", "shipped to 5M users"
- Promotions and increasing scope over time (trajectory)
- Concrete examples: "built X which did Y"
- Results even in resource-constrained environments
- Would their bosses rate them 8+ and hire them again?

**Red flags**:
- Vague: "worked on", "contributed to", "helped with"
- No metrics even for senior roles
- Flat trajectory (same level/scope over years)
- Titles without corresponding impact stories

### 4. Technical Depth
**What it is**: Everyone should code, build, or have deep technical understanding.

**How to spot it**:
- GitHub/portfolio with real projects
- Technical blog posts or writing
- Can explain complex systems simply
- Specific technical choices and tradeoffs mentioned
- For non-eng: deep understanding of how things work, technical curiosity

**Red flags**:
- Avoids technical detail
- Can't explain their technical work
- No evidence of building things
- Relies entirely on others for technical decisions

### 5. AI-Native
**What it is**: Uses AI tools daily, understands implications, sees opportunities.

**How to spot it**:
- Mentions specific tools: Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot
- Built something with AI or integrated AI into workflow
- Understands AI capabilities and limitations
- Excited about AI, not fearful
- Uses AI to accelerate their own work

**Red flags**:
- No mention of AI tools
- Seems unaware of AI capabilities
- Treats AI as novelty vs. fundamental shift
- Behind the curve on modern tools

### 6. Communication Excellence
**What it is**: Writes clearly, explains complex ideas simply, collaborates well.

**How to spot it** (their APPLICATION is a sample!):
- Clear, structured writing
- Gets to the point
- Explains technical concepts accessibly
- Good questions in interviews
- Public writing/speaking if available

**Red flags**:
- Rambling or unclear application
- Can't articulate their own work
- Jargon-heavy without substance
- Poor writing quality

### 7. World-Class at Something
**What it is**: Top 1% in at least one domain. Demonstrable excellence.

**How to spot it**:
- Recognized expertise: patents, publications, talks, awards
- Deep mastery evident in how they discuss their domain
- Built something impressive in their area
- Others seek them out for this expertise
- "The person you call" for X

**Red flags**:
- Average across the board
- No area of clear strength
- Jack of all trades, master of none
- Can't point to what they're best at

### 8. Interesting Person
**What it is**: Curious, diverse interests, unique perspective. Someone you'd want at dinner.

**How to spot it**:
- Unusual background or path
- Hobbies/interests outside work
- Asks interesting questions
- Learns continuously
- Brings different perspective to problems

**Red flags**:
- One-dimensional
- No interests outside work
- Generic responses
- Nothing memorable about them

## How to Use This Framework

### Option 1: Manual Screening

When reviewing a resume or application:

1. **Score each universal trait** (1-5 scale)
2. **Note specific evidence** for each score
3. **Flag red flags** explicitly
4. **Assess role-specific fit**
5. **Make a verdict**: Must Interview / Worth Exploring / Pass

Use this template for each candidate:

```markdown
## [Candidate Name] — [Overall Score]/100

### Universal Traits Assessment
| Trait | Score (1-5) | Evidence |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| High Agency | | [specific quote or observation] |
| Grit | | [specific quote or observation] |
| Impact | | [specific quote or observation] |
| Technical | | [specific quote or observation] |
| AI-Native | | [specific quote or observation] |
| Communication | | [specific quote or observation] |
| World-Class | | [specific quote or observation] |
| Interesting | | [specific quote or observation] |

### Role-Specific Fit
[Assessment against role requirements]

### Why We'd Be Thrilled
- [Specific exceptional signals]

### Questions to Probe
- [Specific areas needing verification]

### Verdict
[Must Interview / Worth Exploring / Pass]
```

### Option 2: Batch Screening with Claude

For processing multiple candidates:

1. Gather applications (export from your ATS or collect manually)
2. Ask Claude to evaluate each candidate against the framework
3. Request a ranked summary with verdicts
4. Deep-dive on top candidates

Example prompt:
```
I have [X] candidates for [Role]. Please evaluate each against our hiring framework:
- Score universal traits (1-5)
- Note role-specific fit
- Give verdict: Must Interview / Worth Exploring / Pass
- Rank top 5 with reasoning

```

## The Bar

> "90% confidence that this person can do a job only 10% of candidates could do."

We're not asking "can they do the job?" We're asking "would we be thrilled to work with them every day?"

- **Must Interview**: Multiple strong signals across traits, world-class at something, high skill AND will
- **Worth Exploring**: Promising but questions remain — needs interview to resolve
- **Pass**: Missing must-haves, too many red flags, or just "fine"

When in doubt, pass. Better to miss someone good than hire someone mediocre.

## Customization

To customize this skill for your company:

1. **Add your roles**: Create `references/your-roles.md` with role-specific traits for your open positions
2. **Adjust traits**: If a universal trait doesn't apply (e.g., AI-Native for non-tech company), modify the framework
3. **Set your bar**: Adjust scoring thresholds based on role seniority and market conditions
