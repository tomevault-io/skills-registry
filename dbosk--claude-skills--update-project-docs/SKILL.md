# Update Project Docs

Keep CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md current so future AI sessions start with accurate
project context.

## When to Trigger

Activate after completing changes that affect how someone navigates or works in
the project. Both conditions must hold:

1. The project contains a CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md (if not, skip)
2. The changes meet the significance threshold below

### Significance Threshold

**Trigger (update needed):**
- New modules, packages, or top-level directories
- Renamed/moved/deleted files that CLAUDE.md references
- Changed build commands, test commands, or tooling
- New conventions or patterns introduced
- API/interface changes affecting documented entry points
- Document structure reorganization (text projects)
- New dependencies that require setup steps

**Skip (too small to trigger):**
- Bug fixes within existing architecture
- Adding content within existing structure
- Minor refactors (rename variable, extract small helper)
- Test additions following existing patterns
- Typo fixes, formatting changes

## Workflow

1. **Check for docs** — Locate CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md in the project root. If
   neither exists, stop.

2. **Review what changed** — Use `git diff` or recall the changes just made.
   Identify which aspects affect project navigation or workflow.

3. **Read current docs** — Load the existing CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md to understand
   its structure and voice.

4. **Identify stale/missing sections** — Compare the current project state
   against what the docs describe. Look for:
   - Sections referencing renamed/deleted files
   - Missing entries for new modules or directories
   - Outdated build/test/lint commands
   - Conventions that no longer apply

5. **Update** — Edit the docs following the Update Principles below. Preserve
   the existing document style.

6. **Show the user** — Summarize what was updated and why, so the user can
   verify the changes make sense.

## Update Principles

### What to Add

- New module/directory descriptions (one line each)
- Changed build, test, or lint commands
- New conventions or patterns that future sessions should follow
- Setup steps for new dependencies
- Updated file paths for moved/renamed files

### What NOT to Add

- Implementation details (that's what code is for)
- Temporary workarounds or TODOs
- Information already obvious from file names
- Content that duplicates README.md

### Style Guidelines

- **Match existing voice** — If the file is terse, stay terse. If it uses full
  sentences, use full sentences.
- **Keep it scannable** — Prefer bullet lists over prose paragraphs
- **Remove stale info** — Deleting outdated content is as important as adding
  new content. A shorter, accurate file beats a longer, stale one.
- **Preserve structure** — Add new items to existing sections rather than
  creating new sections, unless the change introduces an entirely new category.
- **Be specific** — "Run `make test-integration`" not "run the integration
  tests"

### Scope

- Update only project-level CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md, not workspace or global files
- If both CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md exist, update whichever contains the relevant
  section (or both if the information belongs in both)
- Never create a CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md if one doesn't already exist — that's the
  user's decision

## Reference Files

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `references/update-examples.md` | Before/after examples for common scenarios |
