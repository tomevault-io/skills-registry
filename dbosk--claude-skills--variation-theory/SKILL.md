## Core Theoretical Principles

### The Object of Learning

The **object of learning** is what is to be learned. Understanding develops when learners discern the **critical aspects** of the object of learning.

Marton's central principle: "to learn something, the learner must discern what is to be learned. Discerning the object of learning amounts to discerning its critical aspects."

### Variation and Invariance

The necessary condition for discernment: learners must experience **variation in a dimension corresponding to that aspect**, against the background of **invariance** in other aspects.

**Key insight**: "When some aspect of a phenomenon varies while another aspect remains invariant, the varying aspect will be discerned."

## Critical Aspects as Focus of Variation

**FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**: Variation must occur in the **critical aspects** of the object of learning. Arbitrary variation does not lead to learning.

### Identifying Critical Aspects First

Before designing any pattern of variation:

1. **Define the object of learning** - What should learners understand/do?
2. **Identify the critical aspects** - Which features must be discerned?
3. **Design variation IN those aspects** - Create patterns varying the critical dimensions

### Dimensions vs Values

The principle "one thing at a time" applies to **dimensions** (aspects), NOT to **values** within a dimension.

- **Dimension (aspect)**: A category/feature type (e.g., "punctuation marks", "file mode")
- **Values/features**: Specific instances (e.g., punctuation marks like period, question mark, exclamation mark; or file modes like `r`, `w`, `a`)

**The principle:**
- **Vary ONE dimension at a time** - to separate aspects from each other
- **Contrast MULTIPLE values together** - within that dimension

**Research evidence**: Teaching punctuation marks separately: 15% improvement. Teaching all three together with contrast: 63% improvement.

### Common Mistake: Varying Non-Critical Aspects

**Anti-pattern**: Creating variation in aspects irrelevant to the learning objective.

**Example**: Teaching "why files need open/close":
- **Wrong**: Vary filename or content (not critical)
- **Right**: Vary what happens when close() is/isn't called (critical aspect is resource management)

## Applying Contrast in Documentation Examples

Variation theory is not limited to classroom teaching — it applies
whenever a reader must discern differences between alternatives.
Documentation, READMEs, and literate programs routinely show multiple
ways to achieve the same goal.  The contrast pattern ensures the
reader's attention falls on the **method** (the critical aspect) rather
than on incidental details.

### Principle: Keep the Problem Invariant, Vary the Method

When showing alternative approaches to the same task, use the **same
concrete names, filenames, and identifiers** across all examples.  If
the names change between examples, the reader must determine whether
the name change is meaningful — this distracts from the actual
difference (the method).

### Example: CLI Documentation with Two Delivery Methods

A tool offers two ways to share a log: push/clone via Git, or
export/play via a bundle file.  The object of learning is "how to
share a log"; the critical aspect is "which delivery method to use."

**BAD** — names vary alongside the method, obscuring what actually
changed:

```
# Method 1: push to remote
learnlog set-remote git@gitlab.kth.se:dbosk/demo-log.git
learnlog push

# Method 2: export as bundle
learnlog export -o lecture01.bundle
learnlog play lecture01.bundle
```

The reader sees `demo-log` vs `lecture01` and wonders: does the name
matter?  Is a bundle different from a repository?  The irrelevant
variation in the name competes with the relevant variation in the
method.

**GOOD** — the name is invariant, only the method varies:

```
# Method 1: push to remote
learnlog set-remote git@gitlab.kth.se:dbosk/lecture01.git
learnlog push
...
learnlog clone git@gitlab.kth.se:dbosk/lecture01.git
learnlog play

# Method 2: export as bundle
learnlog export -o lecture01.bundle
...
learnlog play lecture01.bundle
```

Now `lecture01` is invariant across both examples.  The only thing
that changes is the delivery mechanism (push/clone vs export/play),
which is exactly the critical aspect the reader should discern.

### When to Apply This

Activate this pattern whenever you encounter:
- Multiple code examples showing alternative approaches
- CLI usage sections with different flags or subcommands
- API examples with different authentication methods
- Configuration examples with different backends
- Any documentation where "you can also do X instead of Y"

**Self-test:** If two examples differ in more ways than the one
dimension you intend to contrast, eliminate the incidental differences.

## The Three Patterns of Variation

### 1. Contrast

**Purpose**: Help learners recognize that an aspect exists by experiencing what it is versus what it is not.

**How it works**: Present examples that differ in one critical aspect while keeping all other factors constant.

**Example**: To understand "height," show two objects identical in all respects except height.

**Note**: Contrast achieves *separation*—the critical aspect becomes discernible through experiencing variation.

### 2. Generalization

**Purpose**: Help learners recognize that a pattern or principle holds across different contexts.

**How it works**: Present the same critical value in varied appearances. Keep the critical aspect invariant while varying other (non-critical) aspects.

**Example**: Show the same geometric principle applied to triangles, rectangles, circles.

### 3. Fusion

**Purpose**: Enable learners to experience multiple critical aspects simultaneously as an integrated whole.

**How it works**: Vary several critical aspects at once so learners must attend to their simultaneous interrelationships.

**Example**: In understanding circuits, vary resistance and voltage simultaneously.

## Pedagogical Sequence

Research suggests using patterns in this order:

1. **Contrast** - Vary the critical aspect while keeping other aspects invariant. This *separates* (makes discernible) the critical aspect.
2. **Generalization** - Keep the critical value invariant while varying other aspects. Shows the pattern holds across contexts.
3. **Fusion** - Vary multiple critical aspects simultaneously. Enables learners to experience interrelationships.

**Important**: Within each pattern, contrast multiple **values** together. "One at a time" applies to **dimensions/aspects**, not values.

## Temporal Sequencing: Examples Before Generalizations

**CRITICAL**: Examples must precede generalizations. Students need concrete instances creating necessary variation before abstract principles become meaningful.

**Why**: Variation must be **experienced** before invariants can be discerned. When you state a general principle first, students have no variation pattern to map it onto.

**Anti-pattern:**
```latex
% BAD: Generalization before examples
Filer behövs för persistens, datautbyte, och skalbarhet.

\begin{example}[Spara spelets progress]
  ...
\end{example}
```

**Good pattern:**
```latex
% GOOD: Examples create variation, then generalize
\begin{example}[Spara spelets progress]
  Ett spel behöver komma ihåg spelarens poäng...
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Dela data mellan program]
  Ett program genererar data som ett annat använder...
\end{example}

\begin{remark}[Varför filer behövs]
  Filer behövs för persistens, datautbyte, och skalbarhet.
\end{remark}
```

See `references/common-violations.md` for detailed violation types and fixes.

## Common Generalization Violations

See `references/common-violations.md` for detailed examples.

**Violation types:**
1. **Generic/placeholder code before concrete examples**
2. **Block/remark environments before examples**
3. **Incomplete skeletons before complete solutions**
4. **Explanatory principles before demonstrating examples**

**Fix pattern** for each violation:
1. Remove the generalization from its current position
2. Ensure 2-3 concrete examples exist creating necessary variation
3. Add back the generalization AFTER examples
4. Verify students can now discern the pattern from the variation

## Side-by-Side Contrast

See `references/latex-examples.md` for details.

For Beamer presentations, use mode splits:

```latex
\begin{frame}
  \mode<presentation>{%
    \textbytext{%
      \begin{definition}[Primärminne]
        Flyktigt minne med snabb åtkomst.
      \end{definition}
    }{%
      \begin{definition}[Sekundärminne]
        Oflyktigt minne, långsammare.
      \end{definition}
    }
  }
  \mode<article>{%
    \textbytext*{%
      ...
    }{%
      ...
    }
  }
\end{frame}
```

## Generalizations in Semantic Environments

Capture generalizations in semantic environments AFTER examples:

| Environment | Use for |
|-------------|---------|
| `definition` | Formal concept definitions |
| `remark` | Important observations, principles |
| `block` | Key takeaways, summaries |
| `example` | When generalization is best shown through code |

## Language Consistency

**CRITICAL**: When documenting variation theory in notes (e.g., `\ltnote`), match the document's instructional language.

**Swedish terminology:**
- "Variation Pattern" → "Variationsmönster"
- "Contrast" → "Kontrast"
- "What varies" → "Vad som varierar"
- "What remains invariant" → "Vad som hålls invariant"
- "Critical aspects" → "Kritiska aspekter"

## When Applying This Skill

1. Identify the **object of learning** (what should be understood)
2. Determine the **critical aspects** (what must be discerned)
3. Structure content using the **three patterns** to create necessary conditions
4. Remember: "there is no discernment without variation"

## Connection to Try-First-Tell-Later

The try-first-tell-later skill complements variation theory: use try-first prompts to **diagnose which critical aspects students can already discern**, then design variation patterns to teach aspects they cannot yet see.
