# Orphan File Finder

Detects "orphan" source files—those with no inbound references—to surface potentially unused code.

## Why This Matters

- **Reduce Technical Debt**: Unused files rot over time and mislead developers.
- **Shrink Bundle Size**: Dead code might still be bundled or deployed.
- **Security**: Forgotten endpoints or scripts can be attack vectors.

## Quick Start

```
Orphan File Cleanup:
- [ ] Step 1: Scan codebase for orphans
- [ ] Step 2: Review and whitelist entry points
- [ ] Step 3: Archive or delete verified dead files
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan for Orphans

Analyze the dependency graph to find files with 0 inbound imports:

```bash
python scripts/find_orphans.py <directory>
```

**What it does:**

1. Indexes all source files (.js, .ts, .py).
2. Parses imports to build a directed graph.
3. Reports files that no other file imports.

### Step 2: Review & Verify

The script output splits findings into:

- **Potential Orphans**: Files with no imports.
- **Likely Entry Points**: Files matching patterns like `index.js`, `main.py`, `server.ts`.

Example output:

```
Found 12 potential orphan files.

Likely Entry Points (whitelist these?):
- src/index.ts
- src/cli.ts

Potential True Orphans:
- src/legacy/OldHelper.ts
- src/utils/Deprecated.js
```

### Step 3: Archive or Delete

Once verified:

1. Move to a `_archive/` folder if unsure.
2. Or delete: `rm src/legacy/OldHelper.ts`

## Configuration

**Auto-Whitelisted Patterns:**

- `index.js/ts/jsx/tsx`
- `main.py/js/ts`
- `server.js/ts`
- `app.js/ts`
- `cli.js/py`
- `setup.py`
- `manage.py` (Django)
- `vite.config.*`, `webpack.config.*`

**Supported Import Styles:**

- **JS/TS**: `import ... from`, `require(...)`, `export ... from`
- **Python**: `import module`, `from module import ...`

| Script            | Purpose                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `find_orphans.py` | Builds dependency graph and identifies disconnected nodes |
