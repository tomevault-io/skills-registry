# Manage Git Worktrees

Manage git worktree lifecycle for parallel task execution and focused work.

## Mode A: Single Task

Used when user specifies `wt <task-name>`.

1. **Read `agents/session.md`** to locate task in Worktree Tasks. Extract full task block including name, command, model, and metadata.

2. **Invoke: `edify _worktree new "<task name>"`** (requires `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`) to create the worktree with focused session. The command derives the slug from the task name, generates a focused session.md (filtered to just this task's context), creates the worktree in the sibling container, and cleans up temp files. Output is tab-separated: `<slug>\t<path>`. Use `--branch <slug>` to override the derived slug (e.g., when the derived slug exceeds 29 chars).

3. **Parse output** to extract slug and worktree path from the tab-separated line.

4. **Output launch command** using the path from step 3: `cd <path> && claude    # <task name>`.

The `new` command with a task name automatically adds the `→ \`slug\`` marker inline to the task in Worktree Tasks. No manual session.md editing needed.

## Mode B: Parallel Group

Used when the user invokes `wt` with no arguments. This mode detects a group of independent parallel tasks and creates multiple worktrees simultaneously, enabling concurrent work on independent tasks.

1. **Read `agents/session.md`** and run `edify _worktree ls` to identify all tasks and plan statuses. Extract task names, plan directories, and any blockers that might create dependencies.

2. **Check for shared plan directories and dependencies.** For each task, extract the plan directory (if specified). Build a dependency map:

   - **Plan directory independence:** Tasks with different plan directories OR no plan directory can run parallel. Tasks with no plan property are independent from each other. Skip any task that shares a plan directory with another.

   - **Logical dependencies:** Scan the Blockers/Gotchas section for mentions of other tasks. If Task B's blockers mention Task A, exclude both from parallel group. Check Worktree Tasks section for explicit ordering hints (e.g., "Task X blocks Task Y").

   Select the **largest independent group** satisfying both criteria. If multiple group sizes exist, prefer the larger group.

3. **Check for parallel group existence.** If analysis found no independent group (all tasks have dependencies), **output message**: "No independent parallel group detected. All tasks have dependencies." Stop execution. Do not create any worktrees. Return to the user prompt.

4. **If group found, for each task in the parallel group:**
   - Invoke `edify _worktree new "<task name>"` with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` (captures `<slug>\t<path>` output)
   - Parse slug and path from output
   - Collect launch commands

   Process tasks sequentially (one at a time, in order). The `new` command automatically adds the `→ \`slug\`` marker to each task in Worktree Tasks.

5. **Output consolidated launch commands** after all worktrees are created:

       Worktrees ready:
         cd <path1> && claude    # <task name 1>
         cd <path2> && claude    # <task name 2>
         ...

       After each completes: `hc` to handoff+commit, then return here.
       Merge back: `wt merge <slug>` (uses skill)

## Mode C: Merge Ceremony

Used when the user invokes `wt merge <slug>`. This mode orchestrates the merge ceremony that returns worktree commits to the main branch, handling the handoff, commit, and merge sequence.

1. **Invoke `/handoff` then `/commit`** to ensure clean tree and session context committed. If handoff or commit fails, STOP — merge requires clean tree.

2. **Use Bash to invoke: `edify _worktree merge <slug>`** (requires `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`) to perform the three-phase merge: submodule resolution, parent repo merge, and precommit validation. All output goes to stdout; exit code carries the semantic signal.

3. **Exit code 0 (success):** The merge completed successfully. Worktree preserved for bidirectional workflow — the user decides when to remove it. Output: "Merged <slug> successfully. Worktree preserved. To remove when ready: `wt-rm <slug>`"

4. **Parse merge exit code 3** (conflicts, merge paused). Read stdout for conflict report. The report contains: conflicted file list with conflict type, per-file diff stats, branch divergence summary, and a hint command. Session files (`agents/session.md`, `agents/learnings.md`) auto-resolve using deterministic strategies — report as bug if they appear in the conflict list. For each conflicted source file:
     1. **Edit** the file to resolve conflict markers
     2. **Use Bash:** `git add <file>`
     3. When all conflicts resolved, **re-run:** `edify _worktree merge <slug>` with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` (idempotent — resumes from current state, skips already-completed phases)

5. **Parse merge exit code 1** (error: precommit failure or git error). Read stdout for error message. The merge commit already exists in git (do NOT re-merge).
     1. **Review** the failed precommit checks in stdout
     2. **Fix** the reported issues in the working tree (edit files as needed)
     3. **Use Bash:** `git add <fixed-file>`
     4. **Use Bash:** `git commit --amend --no-edit`
     5. **Use Bash:** `just precommit` to verify
     6. **Re-run:** `edify _worktree merge <slug>` with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` to resume cleanup phase

6. **Parse merge exit code 2** (fatal error). Read stdout for error message. Generic error handling: review error output for root cause. Common issues:
   - Submodule initialization failures: Check `git submodule status`, ensure parent repo internet connectivity
   - Git state corruption: Run `git status` to inspect tree. If lock file errors occur, stop and report to user.
   - Branch mismatch: Verify `git branch` shows correct upstream, check `git log` for expected commits

   After resolving root cause, **retry:** `edify _worktree merge <slug>` (same command, will resume from current state).

## Mode D: Merge + Remove

Used when the user invokes `wt merge rm <slug>`. Chains Mode C (merge ceremony) with worktree removal in a single operation.

1. **Execute Mode C** (merge ceremony) in full. If merge fails at any step, stop — do not proceed to removal.

2. **On successful merge (exit 0):** Invoke `edify _worktree rm <slug>` with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` to remove the worktree and branch.

3. **Output:** "Merged and removed <slug>."

## Diff Baseline Rule

When diffing branches (for inspection, validation, or user questions — NOT a required pre-merge step):

- **Three-dot** (`main...branch`) for "what did the branch change?" — isolates branch work from the merge base.
- **Two-dot** (`main..branch`) shows tip-to-tip difference — misleading before merge because main-only additions appear as branch deletions.
- **Append-only files** (learnings.md, memory-index.md): diff merge-base to each side independently (`git diff $(git merge-base main branch)..main`, `..branch`) to see what each side added.

## Usage Notes

- **CLI signature:** `edify _worktree new [TASK_NAME] [--branch TEXT] [--base TEXT]`. Positional `TASK_NAME` is the task name from session.md (quoted). Use `--branch <slug>` to override the derived slug or to create a bare worktree without session integration. There is no `--task` flag — the task name is always positional.

- **Sandbox bypass required for mutations:** All `edify _worktree` mutation commands (`new`, `merge`, `rm`) must use `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`. These commands create/remove worktree directories outside project root and run environment setup (`uv sync`, `direnv allow`). Read-only git commands (`git status`, `git log`, `git worktree list`) do NOT need bypass.

- **Slug derivation is deterministic:** The transformation of task names to slugs is repeatable. The same task name will always produce the same slug. This ensures consistency across sessions and enables command reuse (e.g., `wt merge <slug>` always operates on the correct worktree).

- **Merge is idempotent:** The `edify _worktree merge <slug>` command can be safely re-run after manual fixes. It detects partial completion and resumes from the appropriate phase. Fix conflicts, stage, and re-invoke the merge command without risk of double-merging.

- **Session.md markers are automated:** `new "<task name>"` adds the `→ \`slug\`` marker inline to the task in Worktree Tasks. `rm` removes the marker from the task (task stays in Worktree Tasks throughout — no section moves). No manual session.md editing required.

- **Cleanup is user-initiated:** After merge, worktree is preserved. Remove when ready via `wt-rm <slug>`, or use `wt merge rm <slug>` to chain both operations.

- **Parallel execution requires individual merge:** When multiple worktrees exist via `wt` (Mode B), merge each back individually via `wt merge <slug1>`, `wt merge <slug2>`, etc. There is no batch merge command. Merge each worktree's branch when its task completes.

- **Emergency `--force` flag:** `edify _worktree rm --force <slug>` bypasses all safety checks (confirm, dirty tree, guard). Use only as emergency escape hatch when normal workflow is blocked.

## Continuation

Read continuation from `additionalContext` or `[CONTINUATION: ...]` suffix. If continuation present: peel first entry, tail-call with remainder. If empty: stop (terminal skill — default-exit is `[]`).

Do NOT include continuation metadata in Task tool prompts.
