# winremote — Windows Remote Control

Control a Windows machine remotely via MCP protocol. 40 tools for desktop automation, system management, file operations, and more.

## Prerequisites

- winremote-mcp running on the target Windows machine
- Network access from OpenClaw host to the Windows machine

## Quick Setup

**On Windows:**
```bash
pip install winremote-mcp
python -m winremote
# Server starts on http://127.0.0.1:8090/mcp (local only)

# For remote access:
python -m winremote --host 0.0.0.0
```

**With authentication (recommended):**
```bash
python -m winremote --auth-key "your-secret-key"
```

**Auto-start on boot:**
```bash
python -m winremote install
```

## OpenClaw Config

Add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "winremote": {
        "type": "streamable-http",
        "url": "http://<windows-ip>:8090/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With auth:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "winremote": {
        "type": "streamable-http",
        "url": "http://<windows-ip>:8090/mcp",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer your-secret-key"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tips

- Use `Snapshot` with `quality=50, max_width=1280` for faster transfers
- Use `AnnotatedSnapshot` to identify UI elements visually — each element gets a red numbered label
- Use `FocusWindow` before `Click`/`Type` to ensure the right window is active
- Chain: `AnnotatedSnapshot` → identify target number → `Click` at its coordinates
- `Shell` supports `cwd` parameter — no need to `cd` first
- `ScreenRecord` with `duration=3, fps=5, max_width=640` for lightweight GIFs
- `OCR` works best with `pip install winremote-mcp[ocr]` (pytesseract)

curl http://<windows-ip>:8090/health
