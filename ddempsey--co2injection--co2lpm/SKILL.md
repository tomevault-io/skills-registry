# CO2 Lumped Parameter Model Physics Knowledge

This skill provides physics knowledge for the 0-D CO2 lumped-parameter model implemented in the `co2lpm` package.

## When This Skill Applies

- Modifying code that implements concentration evolution equations
- Changing ODE solver logic or state variable handling
- Implementing or modifying emissions partitioning (field, plant, degassing)
- Debugging unexpected simulation behavior
- Planning changes to physics-related code
- Explaining why the model behaves a certain way
- Working with pressure reversal scenarios

## Core Physics Reference

The model tracks reservoir CO2 concentration over time during geothermal extraction. Key state variables:

| Variable | Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| Pressure | P(t) | Reservoir pressure (relative to hydrostatic) | Pa |
| Concentration | C(t) | CO2 mass fraction in reservoir fluid | kg/kg |
| Upflow rate | q_up | Mass rate into reservoir from depth | kg/s |
| Outflow rate | q_out | Mass rate leaving reservoir to surface | kg/s |

For detailed equations, see [EQUATIONS.md](EQUATIONS.md).
For symbol definitions and units, see [SYMBOLS.md](SYMBOLS.md).
For derivation logic, see [DERIVATIONS.md](DERIVATIONS.md).
For edge cases and sanity checks, see [SANITY_CHECKS.md](SANITY_CHECKS.md).

## Workflow A: Physics Validation

Use this workflow when reviewing or planning code changes.

### Step 1: Identify affected equations

Determine which equations from [EQUATIONS.md](EQUATIONS.md) are affected by the change:
- Pressure evolution: E1 (exponential pressure decline)
- Concentration ODE: E2-E4 (with and without delay)
- Emissions: E5-E8 (degassing, field, plant, total)
- Solubility: E9-E10

### Step 2: Check dimensional consistency

Using [SYMBOLS.md](SYMBOLS.md), verify that:
- All terms in an equation have matching units
- ODE coefficients (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) have correct units
- Source terms have correct rate units (kg/s for mass)

### Step 3: Verify mass balance

Changes must preserve:
- CO2 mass conservation in the reservoir
- Correct partitioning between dissolved, degassed, and emitted CO2

### Step 4: Check sanity conditions

Verify the change doesn't violate sanity checks S1-S5 in [SANITY_CHECKS.md](SANITY_CHECKS.md).

### Step 5: Report findings

Summarize:
- Which equations are affected
- Any dimensional inconsistencies found
- Any mass balance violations
- Any sanity check concerns
- Recommendations for correction

## Workflow B: Physics Reasoning

Use this workflow when explaining behavior, debugging, or proposing solutions.

### For explaining physics concepts:

1. Identify the relevant equations and parameters
2. State the physical interpretation
3. Explain cause-and-effect relationships between variables
4. Use the derivation steps from [DERIVATIONS.md](DERIVATIONS.md) to show how equations connect

### For debugging simulation issues:

1. Identify which state variables are behaving unexpectedly
2. Check if the issue relates to:
   - Pressure reversal (q_eff > q_0c)
   - Delay effects (tau > 0)
   - Solubility limiting (degas=True)
   - ODE coefficient calculation
3. Trace through the analytical solution (gamma_exact or Cf_dde)
4. Check edge cases against [SANITY_CHECKS.md](SANITY_CHECKS.md)

### For proposing physics-consistent changes:

1. Identify which equations are affected
2. Show how new terms integrate into the ODE system
3. Demonstrate that mass balance remains satisfied
4. Identify any new sanity checks needed

## Quick Reference: Module Structure

| Module | Purpose | Key Functions/Classes |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| `model.py` | Core LPM class | `LumpedParameterModel`, `StateArrays` |
| `parameters.py` | Dataclasses for inputs | `ReservoirParams`, `OperationParams`, `ChemistryParams` |
| `solvers.py` | ODE/DDE solvers | `pressure_exp`, `integrate_ode`, `dde_solve` |
| `postproc.py` | Emissions calculation | `emissions()` |
| `utils.py` | CO2 solubility | `solubility_linear`, `solubility_slope_vs_T` |
| `scenarios.py` | Preset configurations | `high_gas()`, `low_gas()`, `delay_demo()` |

## Key Physical Constraints

These must always hold:

1. **Concentration non-negative**: C(t) >= 0
2. **Solubility limit**: C(t) <= C_s(P) when degas=True
3. **Pressure reversal**: Occurs when q_eff > q_0c (extraction exceeds critical rate)
4. **Steady state exists**: C_inf = alpha/beta (no delay) or alpha/(beta-gamma) (with delay)
5. **Delay stability**: For tau > 0, the characteristic root lambda_1 must have negative real part

## Scenario Classification

| Scenario | Key Parameters | Behavior |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| High-gas (Ohaaki-like) | degas=True, high C0 | Solubility-limited, significant degassing |
| Low-gas (Wairakei-like) | degas=False, low C0 | No degassing, concentration dilutes |
| Concentrating | fC < critical | CO2 accumulates in reservoir |
| Diluting | fC > critical | CO2 decreases in reservoir |
| Reversal | fq*q0 > q0c | Outflow reverses direction |
| Delay | tau > 0 | Breakthrough lag, DDE dynamics |
