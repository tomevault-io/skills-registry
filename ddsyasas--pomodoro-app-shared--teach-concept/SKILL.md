# Teach Clean Code Concept

Explain the requested Clean Code concept using Uncle Bob's teachings.

## Teaching Workflow

1. **Identify the Concept** - Determine which Clean Code concept the user wants to learn
2. **Load Specialized Skill** - Use the appropriate skill for comprehensive content
3. **Teach with Depth** - Provide examples, quotes, and practical guidance from the skill

## Related Skills by Concept

When teaching specific concepts, load the appropriate specialized skill for comprehensive content:

| Concept Category | Skill to Use | When to Load |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Naming | `/naming` | Variables, functions, classes, packages naming conventions |
| Functions | `/functions` | Function design, size, arguments, side effects |
| SOLID | `/solid` | Any SOLID principle (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP) |
| Testing | `/tdd` | TDD, three laws, clean tests, test design |
| Architecture | `/architecture` | Clean Architecture, layers, boundaries, use cases |
| Patterns | `/patterns` | Design patterns, state machines, factories |
| Professionalism | `/professional` | Estimates, saying no, ethics, programmer's oath |
| Components | `/components` | Component cohesion, coupling, REP, CCP, CRP |
| Code Review | `/clean-code-review` | Reviewing code for clean code principles |

### How to Use Related Skills

When the user asks about a concept:

1. **Match the concept to a skill category** from the table above
2. **Invoke the skill** using the Skill tool:
   - For naming: `Skill: naming`
   - For functions: `Skill: functions`
   - For SOLID principles: `Skill: solid`
   - For testing/TDD: `Skill: tdd`
   - For architecture: `Skill: architecture`
   - For patterns: `Skill: patterns`
   - For professionalism: `Skill: professional`
   - For components: `Skill: components`
   - For review: `Skill: clean-code-review`
3. **Use the skill's content** to provide comprehensive teaching

## Teaching Approach

1. **Definition** - Clear, concise explanation of the concept
2. **Why It Matters** - The reasoning and benefits
3. **The Rules** - Specific guidelines to follow
4. **Good Examples** - Code that demonstrates the concept well
5. **Bad Examples** - Anti-patterns to avoid
6. **Memorable Quotes** - Uncle Bob's key phrases
7. **Practical Tips** - How to apply it in daily coding
