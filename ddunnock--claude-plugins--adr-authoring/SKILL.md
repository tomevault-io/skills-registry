# Architecture Decision Record Authoring

Write clear, useful ADRs that capture the context, options, and rationale behind technical decisions. Good ADRs prevent re-litigation of decisions and help new team members understand the codebase.

## Quick Reference

### MADR Template Levels

| Level | When to Use | Required Fields |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Lightweight** | Quick decisions, low impact | Status, Context, Decision, Consequences |
| **Standard** | Most architectural decisions | + Date, Decision-makers, Drivers, Options |
| **Full** | Critical/reversible decisions | + Confirmation, Traceability |

### ADR Lifecycle

```
proposed → accepted → [deprecated → superseded]
                   ↘ rejected
```

## Lightweight ADR Template

For quick decisions with limited impact:

```markdown
### ADR-XXX: [Short Title]

**Status**: proposed | accepted | rejected | deprecated | superseded

**Context and Problem Statement**
[2-3 sentences describing the situation and what needs to be decided]

**Decision Outcome**
Chosen option: "[Option name]"

[1-2 sentences explaining why]

**Consequences**
- Good: [positive outcomes]
- Bad: [negative outcomes or trade-offs]
```

## Standard ADR Template

For most architectural decisions:

```markdown
### ADR-XXX: [Short Title]

**Status**: proposed | accepted | rejected | deprecated | superseded
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Decision-makers**: [names or roles]

**Context and Problem Statement**
[2-3 sentences describing the situation requiring a decision.
What is the issue? Why does it need to be addressed now?]

**Decision Drivers**
- [Driver 1: e.g., "Need to support 10x current load"]
- [Driver 2: e.g., "Team has no experience with technology X"]
- [Driver 3: e.g., "Budget constraint of $X/month"]

**Considered Options**
1. [Option 1 name]
2. [Option 2 name]
3. [Option 3 name]

**Decision Outcome**
Chosen option: "[Option N]" because [1-2 sentence rationale linking to drivers].

**Consequences**
- Good: [positive outcome 1]
- Good: [positive outcome 2]
- Bad: [trade-off or negative outcome]
- Neutral: [side effect that's neither good nor bad]
```

## Full ADR Template

For critical decisions requiring traceability:

```markdown
### ADR-XXX: [Short Title]

**Status**: proposed | accepted | rejected | deprecated | superseded
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Decision-makers**: [names or roles]

**Context and Problem Statement**
[Detailed context with background information.
Include relevant constraints and dependencies.]

**Decision Drivers**
- [Driver 1 with quantifiable metric if possible]
- [Driver 2]
- [Driver 3]

**Considered Options**
1. **[Option 1 name]**: [Brief description]
2. **[Option 2 name]**: [Brief description]
3. **[Option 3 name]**: [Brief description]

**Pros and Cons of Options**

#### Option 1: [Name]
- Good: [Pro 1]
- Good: [Pro 2]
- Bad: [Con 1]

#### Option 2: [Name]
- Good: [Pro 1]
- Bad: [Con 1]
- Bad: [Con 2]

#### Option 3: [Name]
- Good: [Pro 1]
- Neutral: [Neither good nor bad]
- Bad: [Con 1]

**Decision Outcome**
Chosen option: "[Option N]" because [rationale].

**Consequences**
- Good: [outcome 1]
- Bad: [outcome 2]

**Confirmation**
[How will we verify this decision was correct?]
- [Metric or checkpoint 1]
- [Metric or checkpoint 2]

**Traceability**
- Requirements: REQ-XXX, REQ-YYY
- Tasks: TASK-XXX, TASK-YYY
- Supersedes: ADR-ZZZ (if applicable)
```

## Writing Effective ADRs

### Context Section

**Do:**
- State the problem clearly in 2-3 sentences
- Include relevant constraints (time, budget, team skills)
- Mention what triggered this decision

**Don't:**
- Write a novel (save details for options analysis)
- Assume reader knows the background
- Include the solution in the context

### Decision Drivers

Quantify when possible:

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Need better performance" | "Must handle 1000 req/sec" |
| "Team preference" | "3 of 4 developers have React experience" |
| "Cost concerns" | "Budget limit: $500/month" |

### Considered Options

Include at least 2 options. Always include:
- The chosen option
- The obvious alternative
- "Do nothing" if applicable

### Consequences

Be honest about trade-offs:

```markdown
**Consequences**
- Good: Reduces API latency by 40%
- Good: Team already knows this technology
- Bad: Adds operational complexity (new service to maintain)
- Bad: Vendor lock-in to AWS
- Neutral: Requires migration of existing data (one-time effort)
```

## ADR Numbering

Use sequential numbering within the project:

```markdown
ADR-001: Database Selection
ADR-002: Authentication Strategy
ADR-003: API Versioning Approach
```

For domain-specific ADRs in larger projects:

```markdown
ADR-AUTH-001: OAuth Provider Selection
ADR-DATA-001: Cache Strategy
ADR-INFRA-001: Container Orchestration
```

## When to Write an ADR

| Situation | ADR Level |
|-----------|-----------|
| Choosing a database | Standard or Full |
| Selecting a framework | Standard |
| API design patterns | Standard |
| Deployment strategy | Standard or Full |
| Library selection | Lightweight |
| Code organization | Lightweight |
| Naming conventions | Lightweight (or skip) |

## Integration with SpecKit

ADRs created during `/speckit.plan` should:

1. **Use consistent numbering** - ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.
2. **Reference requirements** - Link to REQ-XXX from spec
3. **Be validated** - `/speckit.analyze` checks ADR completeness
4. **Trace to tasks** - Tasks reference implementing ADRs

## Checklist Before Finalizing

- [ ] Status is set (proposed for new ADRs)
- [ ] Context explains WHY a decision is needed
- [ ] At least 2 options were considered
- [ ] Decision clearly states the chosen option
- [ ] Consequences include both good AND bad
- [ ] Date and decision-makers are recorded (Standard+)
