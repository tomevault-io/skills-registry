# Requirement Writing Patterns

Write requirements that are clear, testable, and unambiguous. Good requirements prevent implementation confusion and reduce clarification cycles.

## Quick Reference

### The INVEST Criteria for User Stories

| Letter | Criterion | Test |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **I** | Independent | Can be implemented without other stories |
| **N** | Negotiable | Details can be discussed, not locked |
| **V** | Valuable | Delivers user/business value |
| **E** | Estimable | Team can estimate effort |
| **S** | Small | Fits in one sprint/iteration |
| **T** | Testable | Has clear acceptance criteria |

### Requirement Levels

| Level | Format | Use When |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Epic** | High-level capability | Planning roadmaps |
| **Feature** | User-facing functionality | Release planning |
| **User Story** | As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit] | Sprint planning |
| **Acceptance Criterion** | Given/When/Then | Implementation guidance |

## Writing Testable Requirements

### The "Shall" Pattern

For formal requirements, use "shall" for mandatory and "should" for recommended:

```markdown
REQ-001: The system shall authenticate users via OAuth 2.0.
REQ-002: The system shall reject requests without valid tokens with HTTP 401.
REQ-003: The system should cache tokens for up to 1 hour.
```

### The User Story Pattern

For agile contexts, use the standard format:

```markdown
As a [specific role],
I want [concrete action],
So that [measurable benefit].
```

**Good example:**
```markdown
As a registered user,
I want to reset my password via email link,
So that I can regain access within 5 minutes without contacting support.
```

**Bad example:**
```markdown
As a user,
I want better security,
So that things work properly.
```

### Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)

Every requirement needs testable acceptance criteria:

```markdown
**Given** a registered user with a valid email
**When** they request a password reset
**Then** they receive an email within 30 seconds
**And** the link expires after 24 hours
**And** clicking the link allows setting a new password
```

## Ambiguity Markers to Avoid

These words indicate vague requirements that need refinement:

| Marker | Problem | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| "properly" | Undefined correctness | Specify exact behavior |
| "quickly" | No metric | Add time constraint (e.g., "<200ms") |
| "user-friendly" | Subjective | Define specific UX criteria |
| "secure" | Vague | List specific security controls |
| "etc." | Incomplete list | Enumerate all items or state "including but not limited to" |
| "appropriate" | Undefined standard | Specify the standard |
| "as needed" | Undefined trigger | Define when/what triggers |
| "may/might" | Uncertain scope | Decide: is it in scope or not? |

## Requirement Identifiers

Use consistent ID schemes for traceability:

```markdown
REQ-001      # Simple sequential
FR-001       # Functional requirement
NFR-001      # Non-functional requirement
SEC-001      # Security requirement
PERF-001     # Performance requirement
```

## Constraints vs Requirements

**Requirements** = What the system must DO
**Constraints** = Limits on HOW it's built

```markdown
## Requirements
- REQ-001: System shall support 1000 concurrent users

## Constraints
- CON-001: Must use PostgreSQL 14+
- CON-002: Must deploy to AWS
- CON-003: Budget limit $500/month infrastructure
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Solution masquerading as requirement** | "Use Redis for caching" | "Response time < 100ms for cached data" |
| **Compound requirement** | "System shall authenticate and authorize" | Split into REQ-001 (auth) and REQ-002 (authz) |
| **Unmeasurable quality** | "System shall be fast" | "95th percentile latency < 200ms" |
| **Missing actor** | "Data shall be validated" | "System shall validate user input before storage" |
| **Assumed knowledge** | "Standard security practices" | List specific practices or reference standard |

## Integration with SpecKit

When writing specs for `/speckit.plan`:

1. **Use REQ-XXX identifiers** - Enables traceability to tasks
2. **Include acceptance criteria** - Becomes task verification
3. **Mark unknowns as [TBD]** - `/speckit.clarify` will find them
4. **Group by domain** - Enables domain-specific plans

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing requirements:

- [ ] Every requirement has a unique identifier
- [ ] No vague adjectives (properly, quickly, appropriately)
- [ ] Each requirement is testable with clear criteria
- [ ] Requirements are independent (no hidden dependencies)
- [ ] Constraints are separated from requirements
- [ ] Unknowns are marked [TBD] for clarification
