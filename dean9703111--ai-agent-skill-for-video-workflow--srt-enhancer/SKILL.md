# SRT Enhancer

This skill provides an AI-driven workflow for enhancing SRT subtitle files by comparing them with an original reference document (`origin.md`). The enhancement process corrects typos, standardizes proper nouns, and adds proper spacing around English text and numbers while preserving the original timeline and structure.

## Purpose

Enhance SRT subtitle files by:
- Comparing subtitle content with reference markdown document (`origin.md`)
- Correcting typos and transcription errors
- Standardizing proper nouns and terminology
- Adding half-width spaces before and after English words and numbers
- Maintaining exact timestamps and SRT structure
- Only including content that appears in the SRT (not adding new content from markdown)

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Refining auto-generated subtitles with a reference script
- Correcting transcription errors in SRT files
- Standardizing terminology across subtitle files
- Improving subtitle formatting for Chinese content with English/numbers
- Ensuring consistency between spoken content and written reference

## Enhancement Principles

1. **Timeline Preservation**: Never modify timestamps or subtitle numbering
2. **Content Fidelity**: Only correct what exists in SRT; don't add content from markdown
3. **Reference Comparison**: Use `origin.md` as the source of truth for spelling and terminology
4. **Spacing Rules**: Add half-width spaces (` `) around English words and numbers in Chinese text
5. **AI-Driven**: Use semantic understanding to match content, not simple string matching

## Core Workflow

### 1. Locate Reference Document

Find `origin.md` in the same directory as the input SRT file:
- Check for `origin.md` in the SRT file's directory
- If not found, prompt user for the reference document location
- Read and parse the markdown content

### 2. Parse SRT File

Load and parse the input SRT file:
- Extract subtitle number
- Extract timestamp (start → end)
- Extract subtitle text
- Preserve exact formatting and structure

### 3. Build Reference Knowledge Base

Analyze `origin.md` to extract:
- Proper nouns and terminology
- Correct spellings and phrasings
- English words and technical terms
- Numbers and their contexts
- Common phrases and expressions

Reference `references/enhancement-rules.md` for detailed extraction strategies.

### 4. Match and Compare Content

For each subtitle segment:
- Identify corresponding content in `origin.md` using semantic matching
- Compare subtitle text with reference text
- Identify discrepancies:
  - Typos and misspellings
  - Incorrect proper nouns
  - Missing spaces around English/numbers
  - Terminology inconsistencies

### 5. Apply Corrections

For each identified issue:
- **Typos**: Replace with correct spelling from `origin.md`
- **Proper Nouns**: Standardize to reference document version
- **English/Numbers**: Add half-width space before and after
- **Terminology**: Use consistent terms from reference

### 6. Validate Enhancements

Before finalizing each correction:
- Ensure the content exists in the original SRT
- Verify no new content is added from markdown
- Confirm timestamps remain unchanged
- Check subtitle numbering is preserved
- Validate spacing follows rules (see Spacing Rules section)

### 7. Generate Output File

Save the enhanced SRT as `enhanced.srt`:
- Maintain all original timestamps
- Preserve subtitle numbering
- Keep exact SRT formatting
- Apply all validated corrections

## Spacing Rules

### Add Half-Width Spaces Around:

1. **English Words in Chinese Text**:
   - Before: `這是一個example範例`
   - After: `這是一個 example 範例`

2. **Numbers in Chinese Text**:
   - Before: `總共有3個步驟`
   - After: `總共有 3 個步驟`

3. **Mixed English and Numbers**:
   - Before: `使用Python3.9版本`
   - After: `使用 Python 3.9 版本`

### Do NOT Add Spaces:

1. **Within English phrases**: `machine learning` (keep as is)
2. **Within numbers**: `123,456` (keep as is)
3. **Between punctuation and text**: Keep original punctuation spacing
4. **When space already exists**: Don't add duplicate spaces

Reference `references/spacing-examples.md` for comprehensive examples.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Semantic Matching Strategy

Use AI to match SRT content with `origin.md`:
- Don't rely on exact string matching
- Understand context and meaning
- Account for transcription variations
- Match concepts, not just words
- Handle paraphrasing and reordering

### Correction Priority

Apply corrections in this order:
1. Critical typos affecting meaning
2. Proper nouns and terminology
3. Spacing around English/numbers
4. Minor spelling variations

### Quality Checks

Before generating output:
- Verify all timestamps are unchanged
- Confirm subtitle count matches original
- Validate no content added from markdown
- Check spacing rules applied consistently
- Ensure proper nouns are standardized
- Validate output filename is `enhanced.srt`

## Example Enhancement

**origin.md**:
```markdown
今天要介紹 Python 3.9 的新功能。首先是 match case 語句，這是一個強大的模式匹配工具。
```

**Input SRT**:
```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
今天要介紹Python3.9的新功能

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
首先是match case語句這是一個強大的模式匹配工俱
```

**Output SRT (`enhanced.srt`)**:
```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
今天要介紹 Python 3.9 的新功能

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
首先是 match case 語句,這是一個強大的模式匹配工具
```

**Changes Made**:
- Added spaces around `Python`, `3.9`, `match case`
- Corrected `工俱` → `工具` (typo fix from reference)
- Preserved all timestamps and numbering

## Important Constraints

### Must NOT:
- Modify timestamps or subtitle numbering
- Add content from `origin.md` that doesn't exist in SRT
- Use Python scripts or automation (AI analysis required)
- Change the meaning or intent of subtitles
- Remove existing content from SRT
- Alter SRT structure or formatting

### Must DO:
- Use AI to semantically match content
- Compare each subtitle with reference document
- Apply spacing rules consistently
- Correct typos based on reference
- Standardize proper nouns and terminology
- Output to `enhanced.srt`
- Preserve exact timestamps and structure

## Error Handling

### Missing origin.md:
- Check same directory as SRT file
- Prompt user for location
- Cannot proceed without reference document

### No Matching Content:
- If SRT content has no match in `origin.md`, leave unchanged
- Don't guess or invent corrections
- Apply spacing rules even without reference match

### Ambiguous Matches:
- Use context to determine best match
- Prefer conservative corrections
- When uncertain, preserve original text

- **`references/enhancement-rules.md`** - Detailed rules for typo detection, proper noun extraction, and semantic matching strategies
- **`references/spacing-examples.md`** - Comprehensive examples of spacing rules with edge cases

## Workflow Summary

To enhance an SRT file with reference document:

1. Locate `origin.md` in the same directory as the SRT file
2. Read and parse both files
3. Build knowledge base from `origin.md` (proper nouns, terminology, correct spellings)
4. For each SRT subtitle segment:
   - Semantically match with reference content
   - Identify typos, incorrect proper nouns, missing spaces
   - Apply corrections while preserving timeline
5. Validate all corrections maintain content fidelity
6. Save output as `enhanced.srt`
7. Verify timestamps unchanged and no content added

Focus on semantic understanding and conservative corrections. The goal is to refine existing subtitle content using the reference document as a guide, not to rewrite or add new content. Maintain the integrity of the original SRT structure while improving accuracy and formatting.
