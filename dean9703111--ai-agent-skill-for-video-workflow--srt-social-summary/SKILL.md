- Creating platform-optimized descriptions for the same content
- Need to extract key points from lengthy transcripts
- Want to maximize engagement through platform-specific formatting

## Platform Characteristics

### Facebook
- **Tone**: Conversational, community-focused, relatable
- **Length**: 100-250 characters for high engagement (can go longer for storytelling)
- **Format**: Hook in first line, value proposition, call-to-action
- **Hashtags**: 2-3 relevant hashtags (not overused)
- **Goal**: Spark conversation, encourage shares and comments

### Thread (Twitter-like)
- **Tone**: Concise, punchy, thought-provoking
- **Length**: 280 characters max per post (can use thread format for longer content)
- **Format**: Strong hook, key insight, intrigue/question
- **Hashtags**: 1-2 highly relevant hashtags
- **Goal**: Quick attention grab, encourage retweets and replies

### YouTube
- **Tone**: Informative, SEO-friendly, comprehensive
- **Length**: 150-300 words (first 2-3 lines are critical)
- **Format**: Hook + detailed value breakdown + timestamps (if applicable) + CTA
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 strategic hashtags for search
- **Goal**: Improve searchability, set viewer expectations, encourage watch time

## Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze the SRT Content

Read the SRT file to understand:
- Main topic and core message
- Key insights or takeaways (3-5 points)
- Emotional tone (educational, inspirational, entertaining, etc.)
- Target audience signals
- Unique value propositions

Extract the essence without getting lost in filler words or repetition common in spoken content.

### Step 2: Identify Platform Requirements

Ask the user which platform(s) they need:
- Facebook only
- Thread only
- YouTube only
- All three platforms

If not specified, generate for all three platforms by default.

### Step 3: Generate Platform-Specific Summaries

For each platform, create content following these principles:

#### Facebook Summary Structure
```
[Hook - 1 compelling sentence that stops scrolling]

[Value Proposition - What will the audience learn/gain?]

[Key Insights - 2-3 bullet points or short sentences]

[Call-to-Action - Encourage engagement]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3
```

#### Thread Summary Structure
```
[Punchy Hook - Maximum impact in minimum words]

[Core Insight - The "aha" moment]

[Intrigue/Question - Make them want to watch]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2
```

#### YouTube Summary Structure
```
[Strong Hook - First 2 lines appear in search results]

[Detailed Overview - What this video covers]

[Key Topics/Timestamps - If applicable]
🎯 Topic 1
🎯 Topic 2
🎯 Topic 3

[Value Statement - Why watch this]

[Call-to-Action - Like, subscribe, comment]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3 #Hashtag4 #Hashtag5
```

### Step 4: Craft Strategic Hashtags

Select hashtags based on:
- **Relevance**: Directly related to content
- **Search Volume**: Balance popular and niche tags
- **Competition**: Mix high-traffic and specific tags
- **Trending**: Include timely topics when relevant
- **Branding**: Include brand/creator tags if applicable

Avoid:
- Generic hashtags (#love, #instagood)
- Overused hashtags that drown content
- Irrelevant trending tags
- Too many hashtags (looks spammy)

### Step 5: Output Format

Generate output in this format:

```markdown
# 社群平台摘要

## Facebook
[Facebook content]

---

## Thread
[Thread content]

---

## YouTube
[YouTube content]

---

## 分析說明
- **核心主題**: [Main topic]
- **目標受眾**: [Target audience]
- **情感基調**: [Emotional tone]
- **關鍵賣點**: [Key value propositions]
```

Save the output as `summary.md` in the same directory as the source SRT file.

## Best Practices

### Content Analysis
- Focus on transformation/outcome, not just information
- Identify the "so what?" factor - why should audience care?
- Look for quotable moments or surprising insights
- Consider the audience's pain points and desires

### Writing Hooks
- Use numbers ("3 ways to...", "5 secrets...")
- Ask provocative questions
- Make bold statements
- Create curiosity gaps
- Use power words (discover, revealed, proven, secret)

### Emotional Resonance
- Tap into aspirations (what they want to become)
- Address frustrations (what they want to avoid)
- Create relatability (shared experiences)
- Inspire action (achievable next steps)

### Platform Optimization
- **Facebook**: Prioritize shareability and discussion
- **Thread**: Maximize retweet potential with quotability
- **YouTube**: Optimize for search and watch time

### Hashtag Strategy
- Research platform-specific trending tags
- Use a mix of broad and specific tags
- Include branded hashtags for tracking
- Test and iterate based on performance

## Common Patterns

### Educational Content
- Hook: "Most people don't know..."
- Value: "Learn the [X] framework for [outcome]"
- CTA: "Which tip will you try first?"

### Inspirational Content
- Hook: "What if I told you..."
- Value: "Discover how [person/method] achieved [result]"
- CTA: "Tag someone who needs to hear this"

### Entertainment Content
- Hook: "[Surprising fact or statistic]"
- Value: "Watch as we [interesting activity]"
- CTA: "Drop a 🔥 if you agree"

### Tutorial Content
- Hook: "Stop doing [common mistake]"
- Value: "Here's the right way to [achieve goal]"
- CTA: "Save this for later"
