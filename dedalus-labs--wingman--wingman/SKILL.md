# Details that make TUI interfaces feel better

Great TUIs rarely come from a single thing. It's a collection of small details that compound into a professional experience. Apply these principles when building or reviewing Textual/terminal UI code.

## Quick Reference

| Category | When to Use |
| --- | --- |
| [Layout](layout.md) | Alignment, spacing, responsive sizing, content regions |
| [Color](color.md) | Palette consistency, contrast, semantic color usage |
| [Interaction](interaction.md) | Focus management, key hints, modal flow, feedback |
| [Typography](typography.md) | Text truncation, wrapping, Unicode, monospace alignment |

## Core Principles

### 1. Consistent Spacing

Use a spacing scale (1, 2, 4 cells). Mismatched padding between related
elements is the most common thing that makes TUIs feel off. Textual's
`padding` and `margin` CSS properties use cell units.

### 2. Optical Alignment Over Grid Alignment

When geometric centering looks wrong in a terminal, adjust optically.
Asymmetric Unicode characters (arrows, bullets) and mixed-width content
need manual nudging. A centered title above left-aligned content often
needs 1 cell of left padding removed.

### 3. Color Hierarchy

Use 3-4 color tiers consistently:
- **Primary**: key actions, active focus (bright, saturated)
- **Secondary**: labels, metadata (dimmed)
- **Muted**: borders, separators (very dim)
- **Danger/Success**: semantic states only (red/green)

Never use bright colors for passive elements. Reserve saturation for
things the user needs to notice.

### 4. Focus is Sacred

The focused widget must be visually distinct at a glance. Use border
color changes, not just cursor position. A user glancing at the screen
should instantly know where input will go.

### 5. Responsive Layout

TUI must work at 80x24 minimum. Use `fr` units and `max-width`/
`min-width` in Textual CSS to adapt. Content that overflows should
truncate with ellipsis, never wrap into garbage.

### 6. Feedback on Every Action

Every keypress that does something should produce visible feedback
within one frame. If an operation takes time, show a spinner or
status message immediately — don't let the user wonder if their
input was received.

### 7. Subtle Transitions

Textual supports CSS transitions. Use short durations (150-300ms)
for background color and opacity changes on hover/focus. Never
animate layout properties (width, height) — terminal reflow is
not smooth.

### 8. Border Consistency

Pick one border style and stick with it. `tall` for primary
containers, `round` for cards/modals, `heavy` for emphasis. Mixing
`ascii`, `tall`, `round`, and `heavy` in one screen looks
incoherent.

### 9. Key Hints

Always show available keys in a footer or status bar. Format as
`key action` pairs separated by thin spaces. Dim the keys relative
to the actions. Update hints contextually as focus moves.

### 10. Content Density

Terminal space is precious. Default to dense layouts. Use blank
lines only to separate logical groups, never for decoration.
Single-line headers over multi-line. Abbreviate labels when
the full form is obvious from context.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Inconsistent padding between similar widgets | Use a spacing constant |
| Bright colors on passive/decorative elements | Reserve bright for actions and focus |
| No visible focus indicator | Add border color or background change on focus |
| Content overflows and wraps badly | Set `overflow: hidden` with `text-overflow: ellipsis` |
| No key hints visible | Add contextual footer with available actions |
| Large empty regions at default size | Use `fr` units to distribute space |
| Mixed border styles in one view | Standardize on one style per element tier |
| No feedback on async operations | Show spinner/status immediately on action |

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Spacing is consistent between related elements
- [ ] Focused widget is visually distinct (border or background)
- [ ] Color usage follows the 3-4 tier hierarchy
- [ ] Layout works at 80x24 minimum terminal size
- [ ] Long text truncates with ellipsis, never wraps into garbage
- [ ] Key hints are visible and contextually updated
- [ ] Every user action produces visible feedback
- [ ] Border styles are consistent within each tier
- [ ] No bright colors on passive elements
- [ ] Transitions are short (150-300ms) and only on color/opacity
