# Design System Assembly

## Overview

Synthesize individual screenshot extractions produced by `humaninloop:analysis-screenshot` into a unified, coherent design system. Every token in the final system traces back to its source screenshot, every conflict is documented with resolution rationale, and the output is implementation-ready.

## When to Use

- Multiple screenshot extractions exist and need merging into one system
- Token consolidation required across color, typography, spacing, and elevation
- Component variants from different sources need harmonizing
- Building a unified design system from visual inspiration across apps
- Preparing implementation-ready token definitions from merged extractions

## When NOT to Use

- Only one screenshot extraction exists (no merging needed -- use the extraction directly)
- Designing from scratch without reference screenshots (use `humaninloop:patterns-interface-design`)
- Extractions have not been completed yet (run `humaninloop:analysis-screenshot` first)
- Implementing an already-defined design system (no synthesis needed)

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED:** Run `humaninloop:analysis-screenshot` on each reference screenshot before invoking this skill. Each extraction provides the raw material for assembly.

Gather all extraction documents. Each extraction should contain: color palette, typography scale, spacing scale, component catalog, layout structure, and border/elevation system.

## Phase 1: Extraction Inventory

Before merging anything, catalog what exists.

### Process

1. List every extraction by source name (e.g., "Linear dashboard," "Stripe checkout," "Notion sidebar")
2. For each extraction, note what token categories are present and what is marked as a gap
3. Identify overlap -- which categories appear in multiple extractions
4. Identify unique contributions -- tokens or components present in only one source

### Output Format

```
EXTRACTION INVENTORY

Source 1: [Name]
  Platform: [platform]
  Color tokens: [count] | Typography levels: [count] | Spacing values: [count]
  Components: [list]
  Gaps: [list]

Source 2: [Name]
  ...

OVERLAP MATRIX:
  Colors:      Sources [1, 2, 3] — merge required
  Typography:  Sources [1, 3] — merge required
  Spacing:     Sources [1, 2] — merge required
  Components:  Sources [1, 2, 3] — normalization required
  Elevation:   Source [2] only — adopt directly

UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS:
  Source 1: [specific tokens or components only this source provides]
  Source 2: [specific tokens or components only this source provides]
```

## Phase 2: Token Consolidation

Merge color palettes, typography scales, and spacing scales from all sources into unified scales.

### Color Consolidation

1. **Collect all neutrals** -- List every background, surface, border, and text color from every source. Group by role (background-base, background-elevated, text-primary, etc.).
2. **Identify near-duplicates** -- Colors within delta-E 3.0 of each other serving the same role are candidates for merging. Choose the value that best serves the intended palette temperature.
3. **Resolve conflicts** -- When two sources assign different colors to the same role (e.g., different background-base values), document both and select one. Record the rationale.
4. **Build unified palette** -- Assign every color a single canonical name. Attribute each to its source.

```
UNIFIED COLOR PALETTE

NEUTRALS:
  bg-base:       #1A1A2E  (from: Source 1 — Notion dark mode)
  bg-elevated:   #222240  (from: Source 2 — Linear cards)
  bg-surface:    #2A2A4A  (derived: midpoint between Source 1 and Source 2)
  ...

CONFLICTS RESOLVED:
  bg-base: Source 1 used #1A1A2E, Source 2 used #1C1C1C
  Decision: Adopted Source 1 value — warmer tone aligns with brand direction
```

### Typography Consolidation

1. **Align scales** -- Map each source's type levels to a common naming convention (display, h1, h2, h3, body, caption, label, overline).
2. **Resolve size conflicts** -- When sources disagree on a level's size, favor the value from the source whose overall scale has better mathematical consistency (e.g., major third ratio).
3. **Unify font families** -- Select one primary, one monospace. Document alternatives considered.
4. **Unify weights** -- Build a single weight scale covering all needed weights across sources.

### Spacing Consolidation

1. **Identify base units** -- Note each source's base unit (4px, 8px, etc.).
2. **Standardize** -- Choose one base unit. If sources disagree, prefer the value that produces the most consistent scale.
3. **Merge scales** -- Combine all spacing values into a single scale. Eliminate redundant values within 1px of each other.
4. **Validate coverage** -- Ensure the unified scale covers micro (2-4px), component (8-16px), section (24-48px), and layout (64px+) ranges.

## Phase 3: Component Normalization

Harmonize component variants from different sources into a consistent library.

### Process

1. **Build a component union** -- List every component type that appears in any extraction.
2. **Merge variants** -- For components that appear in multiple sources, merge variant lists. Remove duplicates.
3. **Retoken components** -- Replace each component's original color, spacing, and typography references with the unified tokens from Phase 2.
4. **Resolve style conflicts** -- When sources use different border-radii, padding, or styling for the same component type, document the options and choose one.
5. **Assign component tokens** -- Each component references only unified system tokens. No hard-coded values.

### Output Format

```
COMPONENT: Button
  Sources: [Source 1, Source 3]
  Variants: primary, secondary, ghost, icon-only
  Resolved tokens:
    Height: var(--space-xl) (40px)
    Padding: var(--space-xs) var(--space-md)
    Border radius: var(--radius-md)
    Font: var(--font-size-label) / var(--font-weight-medium)
    Colors:
      Primary BG: var(--color-brand-primary)
      Primary text: var(--color-text-inverse)
      Secondary BG: var(--color-bg-elevated)
  Conflict notes:
    Source 1 used 8px radius, Source 3 used 12px.
    Decision: 8px — matches the overall compact density.
```

## Phase 4: Hierarchy Establishment

Define primary/secondary/tertiary relationships across the entire system.

### Color Hierarchy

| Level | Purpose | Example Assignment |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Primary | Main actions, brand expression | Brand color for buttons, links |
| Secondary | Supporting actions, alternative paths | Muted brand for secondary buttons |
| Tertiary | Background accents, hover states | Tinted surfaces |
| Neutral | Content, structure, text | Gray scale for text and borders |
| Semantic | Status communication | Success, warning, error, info |

### Typography Hierarchy

| Level | Role | Tokens |
|-------|------|--------|
| Display | Hero content, landing sections | Largest size, heaviest weight |
| Heading | Section titles, page headers | h1 through h3 |
| Body | Primary content, descriptions | Standard reading size |
| UI | Labels, buttons, inputs | Slightly smaller, medium weight |
| Caption | Metadata, timestamps, help text | Smallest, muted color |

### Spacing Hierarchy

| Context | Scale Range | Application |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Component internals | 2xs through sm | Icon gaps, input padding, tight pairs |
| Between elements | sm through lg | Form fields, button groups, list items |
| Section separation | lg through 2xl | Content sections, card groups |
| Layout structure | 2xl through 3xl | Page margins, major divisions |

## Phase 5: Conflict Resolution

All conflicts identified during Phases 2-4 MUST be documented in a single conflict log.

### Conflict Log Format

```
CONFLICT LOG

ID: C-001
Category: Color
Description: Background base color differs between sources
  Source 1: #1A1A2E (warm dark blue)
  Source 2: #1C1C1C (neutral dark gray)
Resolution: Adopted #1A1A2E
Rationale: Warm undertone creates more inviting feel; neutral gray reserved
  for elevated surfaces to create natural contrast hierarchy.

ID: C-002
Category: Spacing
Description: Base unit differs between sources
  Source 1: 4px base
  Source 3: 8px base
Resolution: Adopted 8px base
Rationale: 8px produces fewer fractional values at standard component sizes;
  4px granularity available through 0.5x multiplier where needed.
```

Mark every conflict with a unique ID. Reference these IDs in the final system documentation when a token's origin involves a resolved conflict.

## Phase 6: System Documentation

Produce the final design system document.

### Required Sections

1. **System Overview** -- Name, purpose, sources, design philosophy
2. **Color System** -- Full palette organized by role, with source attribution
3. **Typography System** -- Font families, type scale, weight scale, line heights
4. **Spacing System** -- Base unit, full scale, usage guidelines
5. **Border and Elevation** -- Radii, shadows, border treatments, depth strategy
6. **Component Library** -- Each component with tokens, variants, and states
7. **Source Attribution Index** -- Every token traced to its origin screenshot
8. **Conflict Resolution Log** -- Full log from Phase 5
9. **Known Gaps** -- Aggregated gaps from all extractions plus assembly-stage gaps

### Source Attribution Index Format

```
SOURCE ATTRIBUTION INDEX

Token                    Source          Conflict?
──────────────────────── ─────────────── ─────────
--color-brand-primary    Source 1        No
--color-bg-base          Source 1        C-001
--color-bg-elevated      Source 2        No
--font-family-primary    Source 1        No
--space-base             Source 3        C-002
--radius-md              Source 1        C-003
```

## Phase 7: Implementation Mapping

Translate the unified system into code-ready formats. See [references/implementation-output-templates.md](references/implementation-output-templates.md) for complete templates.

### Required Outputs

Produce at least ONE of the following based on the target platform:

| Platform | Output |
|----------|--------|
| Web (vanilla) | CSS custom properties on `:root` |
| Web (Tailwind) | `tailwind.config.js` theme extension |
| iOS | SwiftUI `DesignTokens` enum |
| Android | Compose `Theme.kt` tokens |
| Cross-platform | All applicable formats |

### Mapping Rules

- Every token in the implementation MUST reference the system documentation name
- Comments in code MUST include the source attribution (e.g., `/* from: Linear dashboard */`)
- Tokens not observed in any screenshot MUST NOT be fabricated -- leave placeholders explicit
- Group tokens by category matching the system documentation structure

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Merging colors without checking delta-E proximity | Compare colors numerically; near-duplicates within delta-E 3.0 should merge |
| Dropping source attribution during consolidation | Carry attribution through every phase; final system traces every token to a screenshot |
| Choosing one source's tokens wholesale and ignoring others | Evaluate each token category independently; best values may come from different sources |
| Resolving conflicts without documenting rationale | Every conflict resolution needs a written justification in the conflict log |
| Creating components with hard-coded values instead of system tokens | Every component value must reference a unified token; no magic numbers |
| Skipping the gaps section because "the system is complete" | Aggregate gaps from all extractions; assembly introduces additional gaps (e.g., untested combinations) |
| Producing implementation code without source comments | Code-level comments connect tokens back to design decisions and source screenshots |
| Treating spacing from different sources as additive instead of deduplicating | Merge overlapping values; the unified scale should be smaller than the sum of all source scales |
