# Authoring Technical Requirements

## Overview

Translate business specifications into three traceable analysis artifacts: requirements, constraints-and-decisions, and NFRs. Every artifact traces to a business source. Every target is measurable. Every constraint accounts for its design impact.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## When to Use

- Translating functional requirements into technical requirements (TR-XXX)
- Documenting hard technical constraints (C-XXX)
- Defining measurable non-functional requirements (NFR-XXX)
- Cataloguing external system integrations (INT-XXX)
- Classifying data elements by sensitivity level (DS-XXX)
- Quality gate before architectural design begins

## When NOT to Use

- **Writing business requirements** -- Use `humaninloop:authoring-requirements` instead
- **Designing solutions** -- This skill defines the problem space, not solutions
- **Choosing technologies** -- Constraints document real boundaries, not preferences
- **Implementation planning** -- Use planning skills after technical requirements exist

## The Three Analysis Artifacts

Each artifact uses a distinct ID prefix and traces to business sources. These are produced during Phase 1 (Analysis) of `/humaninloop:plan`: requirements.md, constraints-and-decisions.md, and nfrs.md.

> **Note:** Integration maps (INT-XXX) are now embedded as `x-integration` extensions in `contracts/api.yaml` during Phase 2 (Design). Data sensitivity classifications (DS-XXX) are now embedded per-entity in `data-model.md` during Phase 2 (Design). See `humaninloop:patterns-api-contracts` and `humaninloop:patterns-entity-modeling` skills respectively.

See [ARTIFACT-TEMPLATES.md](references/ARTIFACT-TEMPLATES.md) for complete field definitions and examples.

### 1. Technical Requirements (requirements.md) -- TR-XXX

Map every business FR to one or more TRs. A single FR-001 ("users can sign in") may decompose into TR-001 (authentication flow), TR-002 (token management), TR-003 (session handling).

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| ID | Yes | TR-XXX sequential format |
| Source FR | Yes | Which FR(s) this implements |
| Description | Yes | Technical capability (WHAT, not HOW) |
| Acceptance Criteria | Yes | Testable technical conditions |
| Dependencies | No | Other TRs, constraints, or NFRs referenced |

**No orphan TRs.** Every TR maps to at least one FR. **No unmapped FRs.** Every FR has at least one TR.

**No exceptions:** Not for "simple" systems. Not for "obvious" mappings. Not even when the FR appears to map 1:1 — decompose anyway.

### 2. Constraints and Decisions (constraints-and-decisions.md) -- C-XXX / D-XXX

Document hard boundaries (constraints) and the technology decisions shaped by them, in a single unified artifact.

**Section 1: Hard Constraints (C-XXX)**

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| ID | Yes | C-XXX sequential format |
| Type | Yes | infrastructure / compatibility / regulatory / migration / organizational |
| Description | Yes | The hard boundary |
| Source | Yes | Where this constraint originates |
| Severity | Yes | blocking / significant / minor |
| Impact | Yes | What design choices this eliminates; references D-XXX decisions it shapes |

**Section 2: Technology Decisions (D-XXX)**

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| ID | Yes | D-XXX sequential format |
| Context | Yes | The situation requiring a decision |
| Options | Yes | Alternatives evaluated |
| Choice | Yes | Selected option |
| Consequences | Yes | Trade-offs accepted |
| Rationale | Yes | Why this choice; references C-XXX constraints that shaped it |

**Constraints are facts, not preferences.** Each decision record MUST reference the constraints that shaped the choice. Each constraint impact field SHOULD reference decisions it influences.

**No exceptions:** Not for "well-known" constraints. Not for "obvious" technology choices. Not even when the team has consensus — document the constraint and its source explicitly.

**Section 3: Infrastructure Requirements (IP-XXX)**

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| ID | Yes | IP-XXX sequential format |
| Type | Yes | compute / networking / storage / ci-cd / monitoring / security / environment-config |
| Source | Yes | C-XXX or NFR-XXX that necessitates this provisioning |
| Description | Yes | What must be provisioned (WHAT, not HOW) |
| Acceptance Criteria | Yes | Verifiable provisioning conditions |

**Every constraint that implies platform work gets an IP-XXX item.** Constraints document boundaries; IP-XXX items document what those boundaries require operationally.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements (nfrs.md) -- NFR-XXX

Define measurable quality attributes. Every NFR has a numeric target.

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| ID | Yes | NFR-XXX sequential format |
| Category | Yes | performance / availability / scalability / security / other |
| Requirement | Yes | The quality attribute |
| Target | Yes | Specific numeric threshold |
| Measurement Method | Yes | How to verify the target is met |
| Source | Yes | Business requirement or stakeholder justifying this |

**"Fast" is not a requirement.** "p95 response time < 200ms under 1000 concurrent users, measured by APM" is.

**No exceptions:** Not for "standard" performance expectations. Not for "obvious" availability targets. Every NFR gets a number, a measurement method, and a source — no deferrals to "later during design."

### 4. [Phase 2] System Integrations -- INT-XXX (embedded in contracts/api.yaml)

> Integrations are now documented as `x-integration` extensions per endpoint in `contracts/api.yaml` during Phase 2 (Design). See the `humaninloop:patterns-api-contracts` skill for details.

Fields per integration: system name, protocol, API version, criticality, failure modes (detection, impact, fallback), authentication details.

**Optimistic integration maps are incomplete.** Every external dependency fails eventually. Document what happens when it does.

### 5. [Phase 2] Data Sensitivity Classifications -- DS-XXX (embedded in data-model.md)

> Sensitivity classifications are now documented per-entity/per-attribute in `data-model.md` during Phase 2 (Design). See the `humaninloop:patterns-entity-modeling` skill for details.

Fields per entity: classification level, encryption at rest/in transit, retention period, access control, audit requirements, masking rules. Compliance mapping table per entity.

## Traceability Rules

Every artifact connects to others. No artifact stands alone.

See [TRACEABILITY-PATTERNS.md](references/TRACEABILITY-PATTERNS.md) for detailed cross-reference patterns and dependency chains.

**Mandatory links:**
- TR -> FR (every technical requirement traces to business source)
- NFR -> source (every quality attribute has a justification)
- C -> D (constraints reference the decisions they shape; decisions reference constraints that shaped them)
- C -> impact (every constraint identifies what it restricts)
- C/NFR -> IP (constraints and NFRs with infrastructure implications reference IP-XXX items)

**Completeness check:** No FR without a TR. No TR without acceptance criteria. No NFR without a numeric target. No constraint without a source. No decision without referenced constraints. No infrastructure-implying constraint without an IP-XXX.

## Technology-Agnostic Writing

Describe WHAT the system must achieve, not HOW.

| Wrong (HOW) | Right (WHAT) |
|-------------|--------------|
| "Must use PostgreSQL" | "Must support ACID transactions on relational data" |
| "Must implement OAuth 2.0" | "Must support secure delegated authentication" |
| "Must use Redis for caching" | "Must cache frequently-accessed data with < 10ms retrieval" |
| "Must encrypt with AES-256" | "Must encrypt at rest using industry-standard algorithms" |

**Exception:** Constraints MAY name specific technologies when they reflect real infrastructure facts (e.g., "existing production database is PostgreSQL 15").

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Every FR has at least one TR (no unmapped business requirements)
- [ ] Every TR maps to at least one FR (no orphan technical requirements)
- [ ] Every TR has testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Every constraint has a source, type, and severity classification
- [ ] Every decision references the constraints that shaped it (C-XXX ↔ D-XXX)
- [ ] Every NFR has a numeric target AND measurement method
- [ ] Every constraint implying platform provisioning has a corresponding IP-XXX
- [ ] Cross-references between artifacts are consistent
- [ ] Language is technology-agnostic (except real infrastructure constraints)
- [ ] ID sequences are sequential with no gaps (TR-001, TR-002..., C-001..., D-001..., IP-001...)

## Common Mistakes

### Transcribing Instead of Translating
Copying FRs as TRs unchanged. Translation means decomposition: one FR often becomes multiple TRs with distinct technical concerns.

### Unmeasurable NFRs
"System must be highly available." Replace with: "System MUST maintain 99.9% uptime measured monthly, excluding scheduled maintenance windows."

### Missing Failure Modes
Listing integrations without documenting what happens when they fail. Every `INT-XXX` entry needs explicit failure modes and fallback strategies.

### Preferences Disguised as Constraints
"Must use React" is a preference unless there is a real constraint (existing team expertise, existing codebase). Constraints trace to facts.

### Unclassified Data
Handling user data without explicit sensitivity classification. Every data element touching the system needs a DS-XXX entry before design begins.

### Orphan Artifacts
TRs that trace to no FR. NFRs with no source justification. Integrations referenced by no TR. Every artifact connects to the web of traceability.

## Red Flags -- STOP and Restart Properly

If any of these thoughts arise, STOP immediately:

- "This FR is straightforward, no need for a separate TR"
- "NFR targets can be filled in during planning"
- "Only two integrations, no need for a formal catalogue"
- "Data sensitivity is obvious, no need to classify"
- "Constraints are implied, everyone knows them"
- "This is a simple system, skip the failure modes"

**All of these mean:** A shortcut is being rationalized. Restart with the full process.

**No exceptions:**
- Not for "simple" systems
- Not for "well-understood" domains
- Not for "tight timelines"
- Not for "we'll fill in details later"
- Not even if the spec seems complete and thorough

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Requirements are straightforward, TRs would just duplicate FRs" | Straightforward FRs hide technical complexity. Decompose anyway -- translation is the job, not transcription. |
| "NFR targets can be refined later during design" | Targets set during design are reverse-engineered from implementation, not derived from business needs. Define now. |
| "Only a few integrations, formal mapping is overkill" | Few integrations with undocumented failure modes cause the worst outages. Catalogue every one. |
| "Data classification is a security team concern" | Every technical requirement that touches data needs classification before design. Security reviews supplement, not replace. |
| "Constraints are well-known to the team" | Implicit constraints cause the costliest mid-implementation discoveries. Make every one explicit. |
| "This is a simple system" | Simple systems with missing technical requirements become complex debugging sessions. Follow the full process. |
