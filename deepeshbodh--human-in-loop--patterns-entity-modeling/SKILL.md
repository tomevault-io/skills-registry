# Modeling Domain Entities

## Overview

Extract and model domain entities from requirements using Domain-Driven Design principles. This skill covers entity identification, attribute definition, relationship modeling, and state machine documentation.

## When to Use

- Creating data-model.md from requirements or specifications
- Extracting entities from user stories and functional requirements
- Defining attributes, types, and constraints for entities
- Modeling relationships between entities with cardinality
- Documenting state machines for stateful entities
- Brownfield analysis of existing data models

## When NOT to Use

- **API contract design** - Use `humaninloop:patterns-api-contracts` instead
- **Database schema migration** - This skill is conceptual, not implementation
- **When data model already exists and is complete** - Don't duplicate work
- **Pure validation rules** - Model entities first, then add validation
- **Technical architecture decisions** - Use `humaninloop:patterns-technical-decisions`

## Entity Extraction

### Identification Heuristics

Look for entities in:

| Source | Pattern | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **User stories** | "As a [Role]..." | User, Admin, Guest |
| **Subjects** | "The [Entity] must..." | Task, Order, Product |
| **Actions** | "...create a [Entity]" | Comment, Message, Report |
| **Possessives** | "[Entity]'s [attribute]" | User's profile, Order's items |
| **Status mentions** | "[Entity] status" | TaskStatus, OrderState |

### Entity vs. Attribute Decision

```
IF concept has its own lifecycle → Entity
IF concept only exists within another → Attribute
IF concept connects two entities → Relationship (possibly join entity)
IF concept has just one value → Attribute

Examples:
- "user email" → Attribute of User (just one value)
- "user address" → Could be Entity (if reused) or Attribute (if embedded)
- "order items" → Separate entity (has own lifecycle)
- "task status" → Enum/attribute (limited values)
```

### Brownfield Entity Status

When modeling in brownfield projects:

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `[NEW]` | Entity doesn't exist | Create full definition |
| `[EXTENDS EXISTING]` | Adding to existing entity | Document new fields only |
| `[REUSES EXISTING]` | Using existing as-is | Reference only |
| `[RENAMED]` | Avoiding collision | Document new name + reason |

## Attribute Definition

### Standard Attributes

Every entity typically needs:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | Identifier | Yes | Primary key |
| createdAt | Timestamp | Yes | Creation time |
| updatedAt | Timestamp | Yes | Last modification |
| deletedAt | Timestamp | No | Soft delete marker |

### Attribute Format

```markdown
| Attribute | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Yes | auto-generated | Unique identifier |
| email | Email | Yes | - | User's email address |
| name | Text(100) | No | null | Display name |
| role | Enum[admin,member,guest] | Yes | member | Access level |
| isVerified | Boolean | Yes | false | Email verified flag |
```

### Conceptual Types

Use conceptual types (not database-specific):

| Conceptual Type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `Identifier` / `UUID` | Unique identifier |
| `Text` / `Text(N)` | String with optional max length |
| `Email` | Email format string |
| `URL` | URL format string |
| `Integer` | Whole number |
| `Decimal` / `Decimal(P,S)` | Decimal with precision |
| `Boolean` | True/false |
| `Timestamp` | Date and time |
| `Date` | Date only |
| `Enum[values]` | Fixed set of values |
| `JSON` | Structured data |
| `Reference(Entity)` | Foreign key reference |

### PII Identification

Mark sensitive fields:

```markdown
| Attribute | Type | Required | PII | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-----|-------------|
| email | Email | Yes | **PII** | User's email |
| phone | Text(20) | No | **PII** | Phone number |
| ssn | Text(11) | No | **PII-SENSITIVE** | Social security |
```

## Relationship Modeling

Relationships connect entities with defined cardinality: One-to-One (1:1), One-to-Many (1:N), or Many-to-Many (N:M).

See [RELATIONSHIP-PATTERNS.md](references/RELATIONSHIP-PATTERNS.md) for detailed patterns, join entity examples, and documentation formats.

### Relationship Diagram (Text)

```markdown
## Entity Relationships

```
User ──1:N──▶ Task (owns)
User ──1:N──▶ Session (has)
User ◀──N:M──▶ Project (via ProjectMember)
Task ──N:1──▶ Project (belongs to)
```
```

## State Machine Modeling

Entities with status fields need state transition documentation.

See [STATE-MACHINES.md](references/STATE-MACHINES.md) for patterns, diagram formats, and common workflows.

### When to Model State

Model state machines when:
- Entity has a `status` or `state` field
- Requirements mention workflow or lifecycle
- Specific actions change entity state
- Certain actions only valid in certain states

## Validation Rules

Constraints and validation rules ensure data integrity.

See [VALIDATION-RULES.md](references/VALIDATION-RULES.md) for constraint patterns, format validations, and business rule documentation.

## data-model.md Structure

```markdown
# Data Model: {feature_id}

> Entity definitions and relationships for the feature.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing entity model, verify:

- [ ] Every noun from requirements evaluated for entity status
- [ ] Each entity has id, createdAt, updatedAt fields
- [ ] All attributes have type, required flag, description
- [ ] Relationships include cardinality and direction
- [ ] PII fields marked and documented
- [ ] State machines documented for stateful entities
- [ ] Brownfield status indicated for each entity
- [ ] Traceability to requirements documented

## Common Mistakes

### Missing Entities
❌ Skipping entities mentioned in requirements ("we'll add that later")
✅ Evaluate every noun from requirements for entity status

### Anemic Entities
❌ Entity with only `id` field and no attributes
✅ Every entity needs meaningful attributes that describe its purpose

### Implementation Types
❌ Using `VARCHAR(255)`, `INT(11)`, `BIGINT` in data model
✅ Use conceptual types: `Text(100)`, `Integer`, `Identifier`

### Undefined Relationships
❌ Reference attributes without relationship documentation
✅ Every `Reference(Entity)` needs cardinality and relationship description

### Hidden State Machines
❌ Status/state fields without transition documentation
✅ Every status field needs state machine diagram and valid transitions

### Unmarked PII
❌ Email, phone, address fields without PII markers
✅ Always mark sensitive data with `**PII**` or `**PII-SENSITIVE**`

### Orphan Entities
❌ Entities with no relationships to other entities
✅ Every entity connects to at least one other entity (or is explicitly standalone)
