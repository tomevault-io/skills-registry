# Interface Design Patterns

## Overview

Craft intentional interface designs through systematic discovery. Generic output happens when structural decisions (typography, navigation, data visualization) are treated as mere infrastructure rather than design itself.

**Violating the letter of these rules is violating the spirit of these rules.** Following "most" of the discovery process or applying "some" intentional choices is not compliance.

## When to Use

- Building web components, pages, or applications
- Creating visual design systems
- Establishing typography, color, and spacing decisions
- Designing dark mode or light mode interfaces
- Crafting data visualization or dashboard layouts
- Making navigation or layout architecture decisions

## When NOT to Use

- Purely backend or API work
- Documentation-only tasks
- When design system already exists and must be followed exactly
- Quick prototypes where user explicitly wants minimal styling

## Required Discovery Process

Before proposing any direction, explore these four elements. Do not skip any.

### 1. Domain Exploration

Identify 5+ concepts native to the product's world. These are nouns, verbs, textures, and metaphors that belong to the domain. **Required even for familiar domains.**

| Product Type | Domain Concepts |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Financial dashboard | Ledger, balance, flow, precision, trust |
| Developer tools | Terminal, pipeline, build, deploy, logs |
| Healthcare | Vitals, chart, monitor, care, clinical |
| Creative tools | Canvas, brush, layer, blend, palette |

### 2. Color World

Identify 5+ colors that exist naturally in the product's physical or conceptual space. Build palettes that feel native, not applied over the product. **Required even when brand colors exist.**

| Product Type | Color World |
|--------------|-------------|
| Financial | Deep navy, muted gold, slate gray, paper white |
| Developer | Terminal green, dark gray, syntax highlighting hues |
| Healthcare | Clinical white, vital blue, alert amber, soft green |
| Creative | Rich pigments, canvas cream, ink black |

### 3. Signature Element

Define one distinctive element that could only belong to this product. This is the unforgettable detail. **Required even for internal tools.**

Examples:
- A specific border treatment unique to the brand
- An unconventional navigation pattern
- A distinctive loading animation
- A characteristic use of typography weight

### 4. Default Replacement

Name 3 obvious choices and deliberately replace them. If the first thing that comes to mind is the solution, it is probably a default. **Required even when defaults seem appropriate.**

| Default | Replacement Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| White cards on white background | Surface elevation via subtle tint |
| Standard 12-column grid | Asymmetric or breaking layout |
| Inter/Roboto font | Domain-appropriate typeface |
| Purple gradient accent | Color from product's world |

**No exceptions:**
- Not for "simple components"
- Not for "internal tools"
- Not for "MVP/prototype"
- Not even if user says "just make it look nice"

## Intent Specification

Define these three elements with specifics before coding:

1. **Who** — Identify the actual person using the interface
2. **What** — Define what they must accomplish (the verb)
3. **How** — Articulate how the interface should feel (beyond "clean" or "modern")

Intent must be systemic. Every token, color, and spacing decision reinforces the stated feeling.

## Surface and Token Architecture

Build systems, not random choices. See [CRAFT-PRINCIPLES.md](references/CRAFT-PRINCIPLES.md) for complete token architecture.

### Primitive Foundation

Every color traces back to these primitives:

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Foreground | Text colors (primary, secondary, muted) |
| Background | Surface colors (base, elevated, overlay) |
| Border | Edge colors (default, subtle, strong) |
| Brand | Primary accent |
| Semantic | Functional colors (destructive, warning, success) |

### Surface Elevation

Surfaces stack. Build a numbered system:

```
Level 0: Base background (app canvas)
Level 1: Cards, panels (same visual plane)
Level 2: Dropdowns, popovers (floating above)
Level 3: Nested overlays (stacked)
Level 4: Highest elevation (rare)
```

In dark mode, higher elevation = slightly lighter. The difference between levels should be subtle: a few percentage points of lightness, not dramatic jumps.

### The Subtlety Principle

Study Vercel, Supabase, Linear. Their surfaces are barely different but still distinguishable. Their borders are light but not invisible.

**The squint test:** Squint at the interface. Hierarchy should remain perceivable. No single border or surface should jump out. If borders are the first thing noticed, they are too strong.

## Spacing System

Pick a base unit (4px or 8px). Use multiples throughout. Every spacing value should be explainable as "X times the base unit."

| Context | Spacing Scale |
|---------|---------------|
| Micro | Icon gaps, tight element pairs |
| Component | Within buttons, inputs, cards |
| Section | Between related groups |
| Major | Between distinct sections |

**Symmetrical padding rule:** TLBR must match. Exception: when content naturally creates visual balance.

```css
/* Correct */
padding: 16px;
padding: 12px 16px; /* Only when horizontal needs room */

/* Avoid */
padding: 24px 16px 12px 16px;
```

## Typography Hierarchy

Build distinct levels distinguishable at a glance:

| Level | Treatment |
|-------|-----------|
| Headlines | Heavier weight, tighter letter-spacing |
| Body | Comfortable weight for readability |
| Labels/UI | Medium weight, works at smaller sizes |
| Data | Often monospace, use tabular-nums |

Do not rely on size alone. Combine size, weight, and letter-spacing.

## Depth Strategy

Choose ONE approach and commit:

| Strategy | Character | When to Use |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Borders-only | Clean, technical, dense | Utility-focused tools |
| Subtle shadows | Soft lift, approachable | General applications |
| Layered shadows | Rich, premium, dimensional | Cards as physical objects |
| Surface shifts | Background tints establish hierarchy | Minimal, elegant |

Do not mix approaches. Inconsistent depth strategy is jarring.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Borders too visible | Use low opacity rgba (0.05-0.12 alpha for dark mode) |
| Dramatic surface jumps | Subtle lightness changes (2-5%) |
| Mixed hues for surfaces | Gray variations, same hue family |
| Harsh dividers | Subtle borders instead of hr elements |
| Missing interaction states | Define hover, focus, active for all controls |
| Pure white cards on color | Use tinted whites matching background |
| Decorative gradients | Gradients must serve function |

## Red Flags - STOP and Restart Properly

When any of these thoughts occur, STOP immediately:

- "This is just a simple component, defaults are fine"
- "The user wants it fast, skip discovery"
- "I already know what looks good here"
- "Inter/Roboto will work, no need to explore fonts"
- "Standard cards and shadows are professional enough"
- "This is internal tooling, aesthetics matter less"
- "Just make it clean and modern"

**All of these mean:** The discovery process is being skipped. Restart with proper exploration.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Requirements are clear, no discovery needed" | Discovery prevents template output. Do it anyway. |
| "User wants speed over exploration" | Exploration takes 5 minutes. Rework from generic output takes hours. |
| "This is a standard component" | Standard is exactly what discovery prevents. |
| "I know what works for this type of product" | Experience creates blind spots. Fresh exploration reveals better options. |
| "Defaults exist because they work" | Defaults exist because they are easy. Easy is not distinctive. |
| "Can refine aesthetics later" | "Later" rarely comes. Aesthetic debt compounds. Build right from start. |
| "Internal tool, users do not care" | Internal users deserve craft. Poor tools reduce productivity. |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] 5+ native colors explored
- [ ] Signature element defined
- [ ] 3 defaults named and replaced

**Intent:**
- [ ] User persona specified
- [ ] Core action (verb) defined
- [ ] Feeling articulated (not "clean" or "modern")
