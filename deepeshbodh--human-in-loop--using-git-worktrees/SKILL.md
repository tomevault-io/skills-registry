# Using Git Worktrees

## Overview

Create isolated workspaces sharing the same repository for parallel branch work. Follow systematic directory selection and safety verification to ensure reliable isolation.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.** Skipping safety verification "just this once" or assuming directory locations are the most common causes of worktree problems.

## When to Use

- Starting feature work requiring isolation from current workspace
- Working on multiple branches simultaneously
- Executing implementation plans in a clean environment (**OPTIONAL:** pairs with `humaninloop:plan`)
- Testing changes without affecting the main working directory
- Parallel code review while continuing development

## When NOT to Use

- **Single-branch workflows**: No need for isolation when working linearly
- **Quick fixes on current branch**: Worktrees add overhead for simple changes
- **Non-git repositories**: Worktrees are git-specific
- **Temporary experiments**: A simple branch may suffice
- **When disk space is constrained**: Each worktree duplicates working files

## Red Flags - STOP and Restart Properly

If any of these thoughts arise, STOP immediately:

- "The directory is probably already ignored"
- "I know where worktrees go in this project"
- "Tests are slow, I'll skip baseline verification"
- "This is a simple project, safety checks are overkill"
- "User wants to start quickly, I'll verify later"
- "I've done this before, I can skip the priority order"

**All of these mean:** Rationalization is occurring. Restart with proper process.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Directory is probably ignored" | Probably =/= verified. One `git check-ignore` command takes seconds. Always verify. |
| "I know where worktrees go here" | Knowledge =/= following process. Check existing directories, then CLAUDE.md, then ask. |
| "Tests are slow" | Slow tests =/= skip tests. Baseline verification prevents hours of debugging wrong baseline. |
| "Simple project" | Simple projects have caused the biggest worktree pollution. Process exists because of them. |
| "Will verify later" | Later rarely comes. Worktree contents in git history are permanent mistakes. Do it now. |
| "User seems impatient" | Impatience is not permission. Explain why verification matters. |

## Core Process

### Step 1: Directory Selection

Follow this priority order strictly:

**1.1 Check Existing Directories**

```bash
# Check in priority order
ls -d .worktrees 2>/dev/null     # Preferred (hidden)
ls -d worktrees 2>/dev/null      # Alternative
```

If found, use that directory. If both exist, `.worktrees` takes precedence.

**1.2 Check CLAUDE.md Configuration**

```bash
grep -i "worktree.*director" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null
```

If a preference is specified, use it without asking.

**1.3 Ask User**

Only when no directory exists AND no CLAUDE.md preference:

```
No worktree directory found. Where should worktrees be created?

1. .worktrees/ (project-local, hidden)
2. ~/worktrees/<project-name>/ (global location)

Which is preferred?
```

**No exceptions:**
- Not for "obvious" projects
- Not for "standard" setups
- Not when "everyone uses .worktrees"
- Not even if user says "just use the usual place"

### Step 2: Safety Verification

**For project-local directories (.worktrees or worktrees):**

MUST verify directory is ignored before creating worktree:

```bash
# Verify directory is ignored (respects local, global, and system gitignore)
git check-ignore -q .worktrees 2>/dev/null || git check-ignore -q worktrees 2>/dev/null
```

**If NOT ignored:**

1. Add appropriate line to `.gitignore`
2. Commit the change: `git add .gitignore && git commit -m "chore: add worktree directory to gitignore"`
3. Proceed with worktree creation

**Why critical:** Prevents accidentally committing worktree contents to repository. Worktree contents in git history cannot be fully removed without history rewriting.

**For global directories (e.g., ~/worktrees):**

No gitignore verification needed - outside project entirely.

**No exceptions:**
- Not for "I'm pretty sure it's already ignored"
- Not for "this repo has good gitignore defaults"
- Not when "I'll check after creating the worktree"
- Not even for "the user said don't worry about it"

### Step 3: Create Worktree

```bash
# Get project name
project=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")

# Determine full path based on location type
# For project-local:
path=".worktrees/$BRANCH_NAME"
# For global:
path="$HOME/worktrees/$project/$BRANCH_NAME"

# Create worktree with new branch
git worktree add "$path" -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
cd "$path"
```

### Step 4: Run Project Setup

Auto-detect and run appropriate setup commands:

| File | Setup Command |
|------|---------------|
| `package.json` | `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install` |
| `Cargo.toml` | `cargo build` |
| `requirements.txt` | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| `pyproject.toml` | `poetry install` or `pip install -e .` |
| `go.mod` | `go mod download` |
| `Gemfile` | `bundle install` |

Skip setup only if no recognizable project file exists.

### Step 5: Verify Clean Baseline

Run tests to ensure worktree starts clean:

```bash
# Use project-appropriate command
npm test        # Node.js
cargo test      # Rust
pytest          # Python
go test ./...   # Go
bundle exec rspec  # Ruby
```

**If tests fail:** Report failures with details. Ask whether to proceed or investigate.

**If tests pass:** Report success with test count.

**If no test command available:** Note this and proceed, but warn that baseline is unverified.

**No exceptions:**
- Not for "tests are slow, user wants to start"
- Not for "I ran tests recently in the main worktree"
- Not when "this is a simple feature, baseline doesn't matter"
- Not even for "user explicitly asked to skip testing"

### Step 6: Report Completion

```
Worktree ready at <full-path>
Branch: <branch-name>
Tests: <N> passing, 0 failures (or "no test suite detected")
Ready to implement <feature-name>
```

After implementation is complete, follow the cleanup workflow in the Multi-Worktree Management section.

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `.worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored first) |
| `worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored first) |
| Both exist | Use `.worktrees/` |
| Neither exists | Check CLAUDE.md, then ask user |
| Directory not ignored | Add to .gitignore, commit, then proceed |
| Tests fail during baseline | Report failures, ask before proceeding |
| No package manager file | Skip dependency install, note it |
| No test suite | Proceed with warning about unverified baseline |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Skipping ignore verification | Worktree contents get tracked, pollute git status, potentially committed | Always run `git check-ignore` for project-local directories |
| Assuming directory location | Creates inconsistency, violates project conventions | Follow priority: existing > CLAUDE.md > ask |
| Proceeding with failing tests | Cannot distinguish new bugs from pre-existing issues | Report failures, get explicit permission |
| Hardcoding setup commands | Breaks on projects using different tools | Auto-detect from project files |
| Skipping user prompt | Creates worktrees where user does not want them | When ambiguous, always ask |

## Error Recovery

### Worktree Creation Fails

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `fatal: '<path>' already exists` | Directory exists from previous attempt | Remove directory: `rm -rf <path>`, then retry |
| `fatal: '<branch>' is already checked out` | Branch active in another worktree | Use different branch name or remove existing worktree |
| `fatal: not a git repository` | Not in a git repo | Navigate to git repository root first |
| `fatal: invalid reference` | Base branch doesn't exist | Verify branch name, fetch from remote if needed |

### Recovery Steps

1. **Check worktree state:** `git worktree list`
2. **Identify stuck entries:** Look for paths that no longer exist
3. **Prune stale entries:** `git worktree prune`
4. **Force remove if needed:** `git worktree remove --force <path>`

### Locked Worktrees

If a worktree shows as locked:

```bash
# Check lock status
git worktree list --porcelain | grep -A1 locked

# Unlock (only if certain no process is using it)
git worktree unlock <path>
```

## Multi-Worktree Management

### Listing Active Worktrees

```bash
git worktree list
# Output:
# /path/to/main        abc1234 [main]
# /path/to/.worktrees/feature-a  def5678 [feature-a]
# /path/to/.worktrees/feature-b  ghi9012 [feature-b]
```

### Switching Between Worktrees

Each worktree is independent. Simply `cd` to the desired worktree path. No checkout or stash required.

### Cleanup Workflow

After branch is merged or abandoned:

```bash
# 1. Return to main worktree
cd /path/to/main

# 2. Remove the worktree
git worktree remove .worktrees/feature-name

# 3. Delete the branch (if merged)
git branch -d feature-name

# 4. Prune any stale references
git worktree prune
```

For comprehensive cleanup after feature completion, follow the steps above.

### Disk Space Considerations

Each worktree duplicates working files (not git objects). Monitor disk usage:

```bash
# Check worktree sizes
du -sh .worktrees/*

# Remove largest/oldest worktrees first when space constrained
```

## Reference Commands

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Create worktree with new branch
git worktree add <path> -b <branch-name>

# Create worktree from existing branch
git worktree add <path> <existing-branch>

# Remove a worktree
git worktree remove <path>

# Force remove (uncommitted changes)
git worktree remove --force <path>

# Prune stale worktree entries
git worktree prune

# Lock worktree (prevent accidental removal)
git worktree lock <path>

# Unlock worktree
git worktree unlock <path>
```
