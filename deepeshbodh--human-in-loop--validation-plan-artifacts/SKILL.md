# Reviewing Plan Artifacts

## Overview

Find gaps in planning artifacts and generate issues that need resolution before proceeding. Focus on design completeness and quality, not implementation details. This skill provides phase-specific review criteria for artifact reviewers.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## When to Use

- Reviewing requirements.md + constraints-and-decisions.md + nfrs.md after P1 (Analysis) phase completion
- Reviewing data-model.md + contracts/api.yaml + quickstart.md after P2 (Design) phase completion
- Validating cross-artifact consistency before task generation
- Quality gate checks before phase transitions

## When NOT to Use

- **Implementation code review** — Use code review tools instead
- **Task artifact review** — Use `humaninloop:validation-task-artifacts` instead
- **Specification review** — Use `humaninloop:analysis-specifications` instead
- **Constitution review** — Use `humaninloop:validation-constitution` instead
- **During active drafting** — Wait for artifact completion before review

## Review Focus by Phase

Each phase has specific checks to execute. The checks identify Critical, Important, and Minor issues.

| Phase | Focus Area | Key Checks |
|-------|------------|------------|
| A0 | Codebase Discovery | Coverage, entity/endpoint detection, collision assessment |
| P1 | Analysis | FR coverage, orphan TRs, testable criteria, sourced constraints, decision alternatives, NFR measurability |
| P2 | Design | Entity coverage, relationships, data sensitivity, endpoint coverage, schemas, error handling, integration boundaries |
| P3 | Cross-Artifact | Alignment, consistency, traceability |

See [PHASE-CHECKLISTS.md](references/PHASE-CHECKLISTS.md) for detailed phase-specific checklists and key questions.

## Issue Classification

Issues are classified by severity to determine appropriate action:

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Critical** | Blocks progress; must resolve | Return to responsible agent |
| **Important** | Significant gap; should resolve | Flag for this iteration |
| **Minor** | Polish item; can defer | Note for later |

See [ISSUE-TEMPLATES.md](references/ISSUE-TEMPLATES.md) for severity classification rules, issue documentation formats, and report templates.

## Review Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

Read and understand:
- The artifact being reviewed
- The spec requirements it should satisfy
- Previous artifacts (for consistency checks)
- Constitution principles (for compliance)

### Step 2: Execute Checks

For each check in the phase-specific checklist:
1. Ask the question
2. Look for evidence in the artifact
3. If issue found, classify severity
4. Document the issue

### Step 3: Cross-Reference

- Check traceability (can trace requirement -> artifact)
- Check consistency (artifacts agree with each other)
- Check completeness (nothing obviously missing)

### Step 4: Generate Report

- Classify verdict based on issues found
- Document all issues with evidence
- Provide specific, actionable suggestions
- Acknowledge what was done well

## Incremental Review Mode

For Phase P2 (Design), use incremental review to optimize time while preserving rigor.

### Full Review (New Artifacts Only)

- Execute ALL phase-specific checks from PHASE-CHECKLISTS.md
- Document issues with full evidence
- This is the primary focus — no shortcuts

### Consistency Check (Previous Artifacts)

- Use the cross-artifact checklist in [PHASE-CHECKLISTS.md](references/PHASE-CHECKLISTS.md#cross-artifact-consistency)
- Do NOT re-read previous artifacts in full
- Spot-check: entity names, requirement IDs, decision references, constraint alignment
- Flag only inconsistencies between artifacts
- **Time budget**: 1-2 minutes per previous artifact

### When to Escalate to Full Re-Review

- If 2+ consistency issues found → re-read that specific artifact
- If contradictions detected → flag for supervisor
- If unsure → note uncertainty in report, recommend targeted review

### Report Format (Incremental Mode)

```markdown
## Review Summary

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **New Artifacts** | {artifacts} - FULL REVIEW |
| **Previous Artifacts** | CONSISTENCY CHECK ONLY |

## New Artifact Issues

{Full issue documentation with evidence}

## Cross-Artifact Consistency

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Entity names match TRs | Pass/Fail | {any mismatches} |
| Schemas match data model | Pass/Fail | {any gaps} |
| Decisions honored in design | Pass/Fail | {any contradictions} |
| Sensitivity annotations present | Pass/Fail | {any missing} |
| Integration boundaries documented | Pass/Fail | {any missing} |

## Verdict

{ready / needs-revision / critical-gaps}
```

### Phase Application

| Phase | Full Review | Consistency Check |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| P1 (Analysis) | requirements.md, constraints-and-decisions.md, nfrs.md | — (first phase) |
| P2 (Design) | data-model.md, contracts/api.yaml, quickstart.md | requirements.md + constraints-and-decisions.md + nfrs.md (2-3 min) |

---

## Verdict Criteria

| Verdict | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| **ready** | Zero Critical, zero Important issues |
| **needs-revision** | 1-3 Important issues, fixable in one iteration |
| **critical-gaps** | 1+ Critical or 4+ Important issues |

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing review, verify:

- [ ] All phase-specific checks executed
- [ ] Issues properly classified by severity
- [ ] Evidence cited for each issue
- [ ] Suggested fixes are actionable
- [ ] Verdict matches issue severity
- [ ] Cross-artifact concerns noted
- [ ] Strengths acknowledged

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Classification of Severity
❌ Marking style issues as "Critical"
✅ Reserve Critical for issues that genuinely block progress

### Missing Evidence
❌ "The data model is incomplete"
✅ "The data model is missing the User entity referenced in FR-003"

### Vague Suggestions
❌ "Fix the contracts"
✅ "Add error response schema for 404 case in GET /users/{id}"

### Reviewing Implementation Details
❌ Commenting on code patterns, variable names, or framework choices
✅ Focus on design completeness, traceability, and consistency

### Skipping Cross-Artifact Checks
❌ Reviewing only the new artifact in isolation
✅ Always verify consistency with previous phase artifacts

### Excessive Re-Reading
❌ Re-reading all previous artifacts in full for every review
✅ Use incremental review mode with targeted consistency checks

## Red Flags - STOP and Restart Properly

If you notice yourself thinking any of these, STOP immediately:

- "This case is different because..." — It is not. Run the checklist.
- "I'm following the spirit, not the letter" — The letter IS the spirit.
- "The artifacts look good enough" — Good enough is not ready. Evidence or rejection.
- "I'll skip cross-artifact checks, the previous review was thorough" — Previous reviews do not guarantee current consistency.
- "This severity is only Minor, not Important" — If you are rationalizing severity DOWN, it is probably the higher level.
- "The reviewer already checked this" — Unless you have evidence of a prior review in this iteration, it was not checked.
- "I'll note it but not block on it" — If it meets Critical or Important criteria, it blocks. Period.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Counter |
|----------------|---------|
| "The spec was vague, so the artifact can be vague" | Vagueness in spec is a gap to flag, not permission to propagate. |
| "This is a minor feature, full review is overkill" | Scale of feature does not change the review process. Every artifact gets every applicable check. |
| "Time pressure means we should skip cross-artifact checks" | Cross-artifact inconsistencies caught now save days of rework later. |
| "The author is senior, they know what they're doing" | Author seniority is irrelevant. Evidence-based review only. |
| "I already found enough issues" | Finding issues is not a quota. Run every check, document every finding. |
| "This check doesn't apply to this type of feature" | If the check is in the phase checklist, it applies. Flag as N/A with justification if genuinely inapplicable. |
| "The constraint is obvious, it doesn't need documentation" | Obvious constraints are the ones most often violated. Document them. |
