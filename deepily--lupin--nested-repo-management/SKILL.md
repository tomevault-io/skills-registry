# Nested Repository Management

**CRITICAL**: Lupin contains multiple nested Git repositories that must be managed separately.

## Repository Structure

| Repository | Location | Remote | Management |
|------------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Lupin** (parent) | `/` | lupin repo | Normal via `/plan-session-end` |
| **CoSA** | `/src/cosa/` | `git@github.com:deepily/cosa.git` | Separate context |
| **Firefox Plugin** | `/src/lupin-plugin-firefox/` | separate repo | Independent |
| **Mobile App** | `/src/lupin-mobile/` | separate repo | Independent |

## Safety Rules

### DO ✅
- Stage/commit/push changes in parent Lupin repo
- Use `/plan-session-end` for Lupin commits
- Manage nested repos in their own sessions/contexts
- Read nested repo's CLAUDE.md when working there

### DON'T ❌
- **NEVER** run git commands in nested repo directories from parent context
- **NEVER** commit nested repo changes from Lupin session
- **NEVER** read nested repo history.md from Lupin context
- **NEVER** offer to stage/commit/push CoSA changes when in Lupin

## How /plan-session-end Handles This

The workflow automatically:
1. Detects changes in nested repos
2. Acknowledges but does NOT commit them
3. Filters nested paths from git operations
4. Reminds you to manage them separately

**You'll see**:
```
⚠️ Detected changes in nested repositories:
• /src/cosa/ (3 modified files)
• /src/lupin-mobile/ (1 new file)

These are separate Git repositories and will not be included in this commit.
Reminder: Manage nested repositories in their own sessions/contexts.
```

## Detecting Nested Repos

```bash
# Find all nested .git directories
find . -name ".git" -type d | grep -v "^./.git$"
```

## Working in Nested Repositories

### When working in CoSA (`cd src/cosa/`)
- Read `/src/cosa/CLAUDE.md` for CoSA-specific guidance
- Use CoSA's own session management
- Commit to CoSA repository separately

### When working in Firefox Plugin
- Manage as independent project
- Has own git history and workflows

### When working in Mobile App
- Manage as independent project
- Has own git history and workflows

## History Files to Ignore

**From Lupin context, do NOT read**:
- `src/lupin-plugin-firefox/history.md`
- `src/cosa/history.md`
- `src/lupin-mobile/history.md`

These are managed by their respective repositories.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't** `git add` files in `/src/cosa/` from Lupin
- **Don't** try to "fix" untracked files in nested repos
- **Don't** run `git status` expecting nested repo files
- **Don't** commit "all changes" - check what's actually in Lupin
