      locator: "!org.found"
      args:

      args:
        org: "dp"
        individual: "sean"
      """

  Scenario: fire — remove a member
    Given an individual should leave an organization

  and linked to individuals via appointment.

  Scenario: establish — create a position
    Given you want to define a new role or position

      """

  Scenario: charge — assign a duty to a position
    Given a position needs specific responsibilities defined
    When you call use with !position.charge
    Then a duty node is created under the position
    And individuals appointed to this position inherit the duty
    And parameters are:
      """

    And parameters are:
      """
      locator: "!position.appoint"

        position: "architect"
        individual: "sean"

      7. locator: "!position.appoint"
         args: { position: "architect", individual: "sean" }
