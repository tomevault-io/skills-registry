name: bug-hunters
description: Run systematic bug hunting with spec reconstruction, adversarial validation, and confidence scoring. Use when you want to hunt bugs (not fix them), validate correctness, or run logic-first/code-first investigations. Triggers: bug hunt, spec reconstruction, logic-first, code-first, orchestrator, logic-hunter, cpp-hunter, python-hunter. Use when this capability is needed.

# Bug Hunters

Use a single skill with role selection. If the user specifies a hunter, use that role; otherwise start with the orchestrator and ask which mode applies.

## Role Map

- `orchestrator` → `agents/orchestrator.md`
- `logic-hunter` → `agents/logic-hunter.md`
- `cpp-hunter` → `agents/cpp-hunter.md`
- `python-hunter` → `agents/python-hunter.md`

## Workflow

1. Read `README.md` and follow the “hunt, don’t fix” rule.
2. Spawn a child agent with `agent_type` equal to the selected role (`orchestrator`, `logic-hunter`, `cpp-hunter`, `python-hunter`).
3. If no role is specified, default to `orchestrator`.
4. Choose mode:
   - Logic-first when the problem is algorithm/spec correctness.
   - Code-first when the problem is language-specific failures or UB.
5. Pass mode and scope in the spawn message, then use `wait` for completion.
6. Use adversarial validation and only report MEDIUM+ confidence findings.
7. Present a bug report, not remediation.
