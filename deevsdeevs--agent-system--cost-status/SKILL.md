# Cost Status

This skill configures the Claude Code status-line plugin that reads session JSON from stdin and tracks costs in `~/.claude/cost-tracking.json`.

## Workflow

1. Install the plugin if needed.
2. Add the status line command to `~/.claude/settings.json` as documented in `cost-status/README.md`.
3. If the user needs the exact script path, use the `find` command in the README.
4. Confirm dependencies: `jq`, `awk`, Bash 4+.
