# Fofum Solidity Audit Skill

## Purpose

Systematically audit Solidity smart contracts for security vulnerabilities using a structured methodology that combines:
- **Static pattern detection** (~40% of bugs)
- **Manual review guidance** (~60% of bugs)
- **Real exploit examples** for pattern recognition

## When to Use

- Auditing smart contracts before deployment
- Reviewing code changes for security implications
- Assessing third-party contracts before integration
- Bug bounty hunting
- Learning smart contract security

## When NOT to Use

- General Solidity development (use a dev-focused skill)
- Non-EVM chains (Move, Solana, etc.)
- Off-chain security (infrastructure, keys)

## Audit Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (15%)

**Objective:** Understand what you're auditing before looking for bugs.

1. **Scope Definition**
   - [ ] Identify all in-scope contracts
   - [ ] Note external dependencies (OpenZeppelin, etc.)
   - [ ] Identify upgrade patterns (proxy, diamond, etc.)

2. **Architecture Mapping**
   - [ ] Draw contract inheritance graph
   - [ ] Map external calls (who calls who)
   - [ ] Identify entry points (public/external functions)
   - [ ] Note privileged roles (owner, admin, guardian)

3. **Documentation Review**
   - [ ] Read protocol documentation/whitepaper
   - [ ] Understand intended behavior
   - [ ] Note claimed invariants

**Output:** Architecture diagram, entry point list, role map

### Phase 2: Static Analysis (20%)

**Objective:** Catch low-hanging fruit automatically.

1. **Run Slither**
   ```bash
   slither . --print human-summary
   slither . --print contract-summary
   slither .
   ```
   - [ ] Review all HIGH/MEDIUM findings
   - [ ] Triage false positives with evidence
   - [ ] Document true positives

2. **Check Compiler Warnings**
   ```bash
   forge build --force 2>&1 | grep -i warning
   ```

3. **Run Additional Detectors**
   - [ ] `slither-check-erc` for token conformance
   - [ ] `slither-check-upgradeability` for proxies

**Output:** Slither report, triaged findings

### Phase 3: Manual Review (50%)

**Objective:** Find bugs that tools miss.

#### 3.1 Access Control
- [ ] All privileged functions have access control
- [ ] Modifiers are applied consistently
- [ ] No unprotected initializers
- [ ] Role changes require multi-sig or timelock

#### 3.2 Reentrancy
- [ ] State changes before external calls (CEI pattern)
- [ ] ReentrancyGuard on vulnerable functions
- [ ] Read-only reentrancy considered
- [ ] Cross-function reentrancy paths checked

#### 3.3 Input Validation
- [ ] All external inputs validated
- [ ] Array lengths checked
- [ ] Address(0) checks where needed
- [ ] Slippage parameters enforced

#### 3.4 Arithmetic
- [ ] Precision loss in divisions
- [ ] Rounding direction (protocol-favorable)
- [ ] Overflow in Solidity <0.8 or unchecked blocks
- [ ] Casting between types

#### 3.5 Oracle & Price Feeds
- [ ] Stale price checks
- [ ] Freshness thresholds appropriate
- [ ] Flash loan resistance (TWAP vs spot)
- [ ] Fallback oracle behavior

#### 3.6 External Integrations
- [ ] Return values checked
- [ ] Weird token handling (fee-on-transfer, rebasing)
- [ ] Reentrancy from callbacks
- [ ] Protocol assumptions documented

#### 3.7 Economic/Logic
- [ ] Incentive alignment
- [ ] Sandwich/frontrunning vectors
- [ ] Flash loan attack paths
- [ ] Governance manipulation

**See:** `resources/checklist.md` for full 100+ item checklist

### Phase 4: Verification (10%)

**Objective:** Confirm findings with evidence.

1. **Write PoC Tests**
   - Each HIGH/CRITICAL needs a Foundry test
   - Show exact attack path
   - Quantify impact (funds at risk)

2. **Test Edge Cases**
   ```bash
   forge test --match-contract Exploit -vvvv
   ```

3. **Fuzz Critical Functions**
   ```bash
   forge test --match-test testFuzz
   ```

### Phase 5: Reporting (5%)

**Objective:** Communicate findings clearly.

**See:** `resources/report-template.md`

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Direct loss of funds, no user action required |
| **High** | Loss of funds with user action, or protocol insolvency |
| **Medium** | Conditional loss, or significant protocol disruption |
| **Low** | Minor issues, best practice violations |
| **Informational** | Gas optimizations, code quality |

**See:** `resources/severity.md` for detailed rubric

## Quick Reference: Common Vulnerabilities

### Reentrancy (SWC-107)
```solidity
// VULNERABLE
function withdraw() external {
    uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
    (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    balances[msg.sender] = 0; // State change AFTER external call
}

// FIXED: CEI Pattern
function withdraw() external {
    uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
    balances[msg.sender] = 0; // State change BEFORE
    (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
}
```

### Access Control (SWC-105)
```solidity
// VULNERABLE
function setPrice(uint _price) external {
    price = _price; // Anyone can call!
}

// FIXED
function setPrice(uint _price) external onlyOwner {
    price = _price;
}
```

### Oracle Manipulation
```solidity
// VULNERABLE: Spot price
uint price = pair.getReserves().reserve0 / pair.getReserves().reserve1;

// FIXED: TWAP
uint price = oracle.consult(token, 1e18, 30 minutes);
```

## Rationalizations to Reject

| Rationalization | Why It's Wrong |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "Slither found nothing, must be safe" | Slither misses ~60% of bugs (logic, economic) |
| "It's audited by X firm" | Audits miss bugs; multiple reviews are better |
| "No reentrancy guard but CEI is followed" | Check ALL functions, not just the obvious ones |
| "Only admin can call this" | Admin keys get compromised; assume adversarial |
| "This is standard OpenZeppelin code" | Integration bugs happen at the seams |
| "Low probability, won't happen" | If profitable, attackers WILL find it |

## Ready to Audit

Provide me with:
1. Contract files or repository URL
2. Scope (which contracts to audit)
3. Any documentation or specs
4. Known issues to exclude

I'll follow this methodology systematically.
