# Test Skill

## Description

A simple skill that returns the current time

## Implementation

```python
```python
"""
Test Skill Module
================

A simple, self-contained skill module that returns the current time.
"""

import datetime
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional


class Test_SkillSkill:
    """
    A simple skill class that provides the current time when executed.

    This class is designed to be self-contained with no external dependencies
    beyond the Python standard library. The execute() method returns the current
    local time as a formatted string.
    """

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """
        Initialize the Test_SkillSkill instance.
        No parameters required.
        """
        pass

    def execute(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """
        Execute the skill to retrieve and return the current time.

        Args:
            *args: Variable positional arguments (ignored for flexibility).
            **kwargs: Variable keyword arguments (ignored for flexibility).

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary containing the current time under the key 'response'.

        Raises:
            Exception: Catches and handles any unexpected errors, returning an error message.

        Example:
            >>> skill = Test_SkillSkill()
            >>> result = skill.execute()
            >>> print(result['response'])
            The current time is 2023-10-05 14:30:45.
        """
        try:
            now = datetime.datetime.now()
            time_str = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
            return {
                "response": f"The current time is {time_str}."
            }
        except Exception as e:
            return {
                "response": f"An error occurred while retrieving the time: {str(e)}"
            }
```
```

## Usage

```python
from skills.test-skill import Test_SkillSkill

skill = Test_SkillSkill()
result = skill.execute(**kwargs)
```
