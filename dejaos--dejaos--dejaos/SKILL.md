# DejaOS SDK 2.0 App Development

Use this skill for DejaOS SDK 2.0 embedded JavaScript apps. DejaOS runs on QuickJS with native `dxmodules` wrappers for UI, hardware, storage, network, MQTT, HTTP, audio, face recognition, UART, watchdog, and related device features.

## First Checks

1. Confirm the target device model before changing project structure or `app.dxproj`: `DW200_V20`, `VF105_V12`, `VF203_V12`, `VF202_V12`, or `VF114_V12`.
2. Inspect the existing `app.dxproj` and `dxmodules/` before importing a component.
3. If a required `dxmodules/*.js` file is missing, tell the user to enable the component in `app.dxproj` and install modules with the DejaOS VSCode plugin.
4. Treat `dxmodules/` as vendor code: call it, but do not modify it.
5. Keep app code under `src/`, resources under `resource/`, and runtime data under `/app/data`.
6. Use absolute runtime resource paths such as `/app/code/resource/logo.png`.

## Project Rules

- Use `dxLogger` for logging; do not use `console.log` in app code.
- Wrap hardware, network, filesystem, database, UART, timer, and worker-boundary code in `try/catch`.
- Keep `main.js` focused on initialization and worker creation. Put UI, serial loops, face recognition loops, and long-running business logic in workers.
- Create workers with `dxEventBus.newWorker(...)` instead of native QuickJS worker APIs.
- Remember that each worker is single-threaded. `dxStd.setTimeout` and `dxStd.setInterval` are pseudo-async inside the same worker.
- Prefer small objects and bounded loops. DejaOS devices have limited memory and CPU.
- Use imports relative to file depth, for example `../../dxmodules/dxLogger.js`; there is no Node-style `node_modules` resolution.

## UI Rules

- Put UI in a dedicated UI worker.
- If UI text includes Chinese or other non-English text, ensure a TTF font exists, usually `/app/code/resource/font/font.ttf`.
- Prefer `UIManager.font(size, style)` to avoid repeatedly creating font objects.
- Use `assets/UIManager.js` as the standard single-screen, multi-page UI manager template when a project does not already have one.
- A UI page should expose `init()`, return its root `View`, and may implement `onShow(data)` and `onHide()`.
- `uiButton` does not have a direct text property. Create a `Label` inside the button.
- `uiImage` is not clickable by itself. Wrap it in a transparent `View` and register the click on the wrapper.
- For topmost overlays, use `dxui.Utils.LAYER.TOP`.
- For `uiView`, call `padAll(0)` and usually `scroll(false)` when doing exact layout.
- Match image control sizes to image asset sizes because `uiImage` does not automatically scale by default.

## Common Components

- Base modules: `dxLogger`, `dxStd`, `dxOs`, `dxDriver`, `dxMap`, `dxEventBus`, `dxCommonUtils`.
- UI: `dxUi`.
- Storage: `dxSqliteDB` for relational data; `dxKeyValueDB` for simple key-value data.
- Network: `dxNetwork`, `dxHttpClient`, `dxHttpServer`, `dxMqttClient`.
- Hardware: `dxUart`, `dxGpio`, `dxGpioKey`, `dxPwm`, `dxNfc`, `dxBarcode`.
- System: `dxWatchdog`, `dxNtp`, `dxOta`, `dxConfiguration`, `dxAudio`.

## Task Guidance

When creating a new app:

1. Start from the target model's `app.dxproj`.
2. Include only base modules by default; add `dxUi` only when UI is needed; add hardware/network modules only when required.
3. Create `src/main.js`.
4. If UI is needed, create `src/uiWorker.js`, copy or adapt `assets/UIManager.js`, register pages, and call `dxui.handler()` in a short interval.
5. Put resources in `resource/`, especially fonts and images.

When modifying an existing app:

1. Read nearby code first and follow existing worker boundaries.
2. Check whether the needed component is already present in `dxmodules/`.
3. Preserve existing page manager, event bus topics, and data directory conventions unless the user asks for a refactor.
4. Verify JavaScript syntax with the available runtime when possible.

When reviewing DejaOS code, prioritize:

- Missing `try/catch` around device and worker boundary code.
- Incorrect relative imports into `dxmodules`.
- UI code running in the main worker.
- Direct `console.log`.
- Missing font handling for Chinese UI.
- Resource paths that are not runtime absolute paths.
- `uiButton` text set directly instead of via a child `Label`.
- Click handlers attached directly to `uiImage`.
- Long loops or heavy work in UI workers.
