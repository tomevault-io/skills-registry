    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="audio-task",
    chat_mode="agent"  # Agent mode is optimal for all audio tasks
)
# Daemon notifies you when complete - do NOT poll
```

## What Audio You Can Create

### Text-to-Speech / Voiceover

Convert text to natural-sounding speech:

- **Narration**: "Generate a professional male voiceover for this product video script"
- **Audiobook Style**: "Create an engaging narration of this short story with emotional delivery"
- **Podcast Intros**: "Generate a warm, friendly podcast intro: 'Welcome to The Daily Tech...'"
- **E-Learning**: "Create clear, instructional voiceover for this training module"
- **IVR/Phone Systems**: "Generate professional phone menu prompts"

### Voice Customization

Control how the voice sounds:

- **Gender**: Male, female, neutral
- **Age**: Young adult, middle-aged, senior
- **Emotion**: Neutral, happy, sad, excited, serious, friendly, authoritative
- **Accent**: American, British, Australian, Indian, and many more
- **Pacing**: Slow and deliberate, conversational, fast and energetic
- **Tone**: Professional, casual, warm, mysterious, dramatic

### Music Generation

Create original background music and soundtracks:

- **Background Music**: "Create calm lo-fi background music for a study video, 2 minutes"
- **Podcast Music**: "Generate an upbeat intro jingle for a tech podcast, 15 seconds"
- **Video Soundtracks**: "Create cinematic orchestral music for a product launch video"
- **Ambient/Mood**: "Generate peaceful ambient sounds for a meditation app"
- **Genre-Specific**: "Create energetic electronic music for a fitness video"

| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **MP3** | Standard audio delivery, voiceovers, music |

## Chat Mode for Audio

**Use `chat_mode="agent"`** for all audio generation tasks.

Audio generation—whether voiceovers, music, or sound design—executes efficiently in agent mode. CellCog's audio capabilities don't require multi-angle deliberation; they require precise execution, which agent mode excels at.

There's no scenario where agent team mode provides meaningfully better audio output. Save agent team for research and complex creative work that benefits from multiple reasoning passes.

## Example Audio Prompts

**Professional voiceover:**
> "Generate a professional voiceover for this script:
> 
> 'Introducing TaskFlow - the project management tool that actually works. With intelligent automation, seamless collaboration, and powerful analytics, TaskFlow helps teams do their best work.'
> 
> Voice: Female, American accent, confident and friendly, medium pace. Suitable for a product launch video."

**Podcast intro:**
> "Create a podcast intro voiceover:
> 
> 'Welcome to Future Forward, the podcast where we explore the technologies shaping tomorrow. I'm your host, and today we're diving into...'
> 
> Voice: Male, warm and engaging, conversational tone. Also generate a 10-second upbeat intro music bed to go underneath."

**Background music:**
> "Generate 2 minutes of calm, lo-fi hip-hop style background music. Should be chill and unobtrusive, good for studying or working. Include soft piano, mellow beats, and gentle vinyl crackle. 75 BPM."

**Audiobook narration:**
> "Create an audiobook-style narration of this passage:
> 
> [passage text]
> 
> Voice: Male, British accent, 50s, warm and storytelling quality. Pace should be measured, with appropriate pauses for drama. Think classic BBC narrator."

**Cinematic music:**
> "Generate 90 seconds of cinematic orchestral music for a tech company's 'About Us' video. Start soft and inspiring, build to a confident crescendo, then resolve to a hopeful ending. Think Hans Zimmer meets corporate inspiration."

## Tips for Better Audio

1. **For voiceovers**: Provide the complete script. Don't say "something about our product" - write out exactly what should be said.

2. **Describe the voice**: Age, gender, accent, emotion, pace. "Professional female, American, confident but warm, medium pace" is clear.

3. **For music**: Specify duration, tempo (BPM if you know it), mood, and genre. Reference artists or songs if helpful: "Think lo-fi beats like ChilledCow playlists."

4. **Pronunciation guidance**: For names or technical terms, add pronunciation hints: "CellCog (pronounced SELL-kog)"

5. **Emotional beats**: For longer voiceovers, indicate tone shifts: "[excited] And now for the big reveal... [serious] But there's a catch."
