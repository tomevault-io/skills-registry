# Crypto Whale Monitor

This skill contains the logic to connect to blockchain explorers and track large transactions for a defined set of "whale" wallets.

## Workflow

1. **Define Wallets**: Get a list of target whale wallet addresses from the user.
2. **Define Threshold**: Get the transaction size threshold (e.g., > 1,000,000 USDT).
3. **Use Script**: Run \`scripts/monitor.js\` with the wallet list and threshold.
4. **Schedule**: Set up a cron job using the \`cron\` tool to run the script periodically.

## Scripts
- \`scripts/monitor.js\`: Core logic for checking Etherscan/Alchemy API.

## References
- \`references/wallets.md\`: A list of known, public whale wallet addresses.
