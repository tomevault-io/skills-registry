# OpenClaw Agent Optimization

Use this skill to tune an OpenClaw workspace for **cost-aware routing**, **parallel-first delegation**, and **lean context**.

## Workflow (concise)
1. **Audit rules + memory**: ensure rules are modular/short; memory is only restart-critical facts.
2. **Model routing**: confirm tiered routing (lightweight / mid / deep) aligns with live config.
3. **Context discipline**: apply progressive disclosure; move large static data to references/scripts.
4. **Delegation protocol**: parallelize independent tasks; use sub-agents for long/isolated work.
5. **Heartbeat optimization**: treat heartbeat as control-plane; move heavy checks to isolated cron/scripts; offer profiles A/B/C and require user choice if removing checks.
6. **Safeguards**: add anti-loop + budget guardrails; prefer fallbacks over retries.
