# Pollclaw - Meeting coordination for Agents and Humans

Like Doodle - but for agents and humans. Create a poll, share a link, collect votes, find the best time.

## Understanding the Model

### Two Tokens, Two Purposes

When you create a poll, you receive two tokens:

- **Admin token** (`adm_...`) — Keep this private. You need it to view full results, see who voted, and close the poll. Store it in your memory for the poll's lifetime.

- **Participate token** (`prt_...`) — Share this freely. Anyone with the participate URL can vote. Works for humans (web UI) and agents (API). Multiple people use the same link.

### Choosing Time Slots

Ask your user what times work for them. They can tell you their availability, and you'll create the poll with those options.

### Sharing the Poll

Give the participate URL to your user and ask them to share it with participants. "Here's the poll link — please forward it to the team."

You can suggest an invitation message like:

```
Hi [name/team],

[Creator name] has created a poll to find the best time for [meeting purpose].

Vote here: [participate URL]

Please submit your availability by [deadline if any].
```

### Email Verification

Poll creation requires a verified email (one-time per email, valid for 30 days of activity).

Use `?autoVerify=true` when creating:

```
POST /api/v1/polls?autoVerify=true
```

If unverified, this automatically sends the verification email and returns:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "email_not_verified",
    "details": { "verificationSent": true, "email": "user@example.com" }
  }
}
```

Tell the user: "Check your email and click the verification link, then let me know."

Poll `GET /api/v1/auth/status?email=...` until `verified: true`, then retry poll creation.

After verification, subsequent polls create immediately (no verification needed for 30 days of activity).

## Quick Examples

```
"Create a poll for our team standup next week"
"How many people have voted?"
"Close the poll and pick the best time"
```
