# UV Global

Create and reuse a global `uv` environment at `~/.uv-global` so you can install Python dependencies for quick, ad hoc scripts without polluting the system interpreter.

Lightning-fast setup that keeps one shared virtual environment ready for temporary tasks.

Use this skill when the user needs Python packages (data processing, scraping, etc.) that are not preinstalled and a full project-specific environment would be overkill. Skip this if the user explicitly wants system Python or a project-local venv.

## Requirements

`uv` available. If missing, you need either `brew` (macOS) or `curl` to install it.

## Installation

```bash
bash ${baseDir}/uv-global.sh
```

The script will:

- install `uv` via `brew` (macOS/Linux) or the official `curl` installer if `uv` is absent
- create a global uv project at `~/.uv-global`
- create a virtual environment with common packages in `~/.uv-global/.venv`

Optionally prepend the venv bin to your `PATH` so `python` defaults to the global env:

```
export PATH=~/.uv-global/.venv/bin:$PATH
```

## Usage

For any quick Python script that needs extra dependencies:

```bash
# install required packages into the global env
uv --project ~/.uv-global add <pkg0> <pkg1> ...

# write your code
touch script.py

# run your script using the global env
uv --project ~/.uv-global run script.py
```

Tips:
- Keep scripts anywhere; the `--project ~/.uv-global` flag ensures they run with the global env.
- Inspect installed packages with `uv --project ~/.uv-global pip list`.
- If a task grows into a real project, switch to a project-local venv instead of this global one.
