# Nostr DevRel Toolkit

A comprehensive Developer Relations toolkit for advocating Nostr protocol, freedom tech, and community empowerment. Tailored for Soapbox/AOS work including Shakespeare, community initiatives, and conference activities.

## Supplementary Resources

This skill includes additional reference files:

- **[nips-reference.md](nips-reference.md)** - Quick NIP lookup table, common combinations, nak CLI cheatsheet
- **[ecosystem-contacts.md](ecosystem-contacts.md)** - Key people, projects, and community hubs for outreach
- **[sample-content.md](sample-content.md)** - Ready-to-use workshop scripts, social threads, Reddit posts, objection handling

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

**Soapbox Products & Content:**
- Plan and run Shakespeare workshops or demos
- Prepare Soapbox Sessions podcast episodes
- Host or promote the Monday Vibe Coding Jam Session
- Create content about Ditto, NostrHub, or other Soapbox products
- Support product launches and announcements

**Community & Events:**
- Onboard new users or developers to Nostr
- Plan community events (NosVegas, meetups, workshops)

**Ecosystem:**
- Support diVine or other AOS product launches
- Collaborate with broader Nostr ecosystem projects

## Core Philosophy

### Own Your Social Life
Nostr empowers communities and individuals to:
- **Own their social content** - Your posts, your data, forever
- **Own their social graph** - Your followers and connections belong to you
- **Own their identity** - Cryptographic keys, not platform accounts
- **Own their reach** - No algorithm deciding who sees your content

### Freedom Tech: Money + Communication
Freedom money (Bitcoin) and freedom communication (Nostr) go hand in hand:
- Censorship-resistant money needs censorship-resistant communication
- Self-sovereign identity extends to both financial and social life
- Open protocols beat closed platforms in both domains
- But lead with the social benefits—the financial benefits follow naturally

### The Relationship-First Approach
**Build relationships → Build trust → Recognition and adoption follow through osmosis**

This means:
- Don't lead with "Bitcoin fixes this"
- Don't be preachy or heavy-handed
- Show genuine interest in what people are building
- Help people solve their actual problems
- Let the technology speak through experience
- People adopt tools they see working for people they trust

### What We're NOT About
- Forcing Bitcoin talking points into every conversation
- Tribalism or maximalism that alienates newcomers
- Technical gatekeeping
- Dismissing other communities or approaches

## Product & Ecosystem Priority

### Priority Hierarchy

**1. Soapbox (Primary Focus)**
- Shakespeare (AI website builder)
- Shakespeare OpenCode Plugin (OpenCode integration)
- Shakespeare APK Builder (Android app generation)
- Soapbox Signer (NIP-07 browser extension)
- Soapbox social client
- Other Soapbox products and services

**2. AOS - And Other Stuff (Secondary)**
- diVine (creator platform)
- Other products at andotherstuff.org
- AOS collective initiatives

**3. Greater Nostr Ecosystem (Tertiary)**
- Other Nostr clients and tools
- Protocol development and NIPs
- Community projects and infrastructure

### Why Support the Whole Ecosystem?
A rising tide lifts all boats. On Nostr:
- Users of one client can interact with users of any other
- Improvements to the protocol benefit everyone
- New users to any Nostr app are new users to the ecosystem
- Content and social graphs are portable across all clients

So while Soapbox is the primary focus, supporting the broader ecosystem ultimately benefits Soapbox too. Help everyone, but prioritize Soapbox first.

### In Practice
When creating content, demos, or materials:
- Lead with Soapbox products when possible
- Mention AOS products where relevant
- Support and celebrate the broader ecosystem
- Collaborate with other projects (not compete)

## Nostr Ecosystem Knowledge

### Core Concepts to Explain
- **NIPs (Nostr Implementation Possibilities)** - The protocol standards
- **Relays** - The servers that store and forward events
- **Events** - The fundamental data structure
- **Keys** - Public/private key identity (npub/nsec)
- **Clients** - Applications that interact with relays
- **Zaps** - Lightning tips integrated into social interactions

### Key NIPs for DevRel
- NIP-01: Basic protocol
- NIP-05: DNS-based verification (user@domain.com style)
- NIP-07: Browser extension signing
- NIP-19: Bech32-encoded entities (npub, note, etc.)
- NIP-55: Android signer application (nostrconnect)
- NIP-57: Zaps (Lightning tips)

### Key Management & Signers
Help users understand secure key management:

**Browser Signers (NIP-07):**
- **Soapbox Signer** - Our NIP-07 browser extension
- Alby (also handles Lightning)
- nos2x

**Mobile Signers (NIP-55 / Nostr Connect):**
- **Amber** - Android signer app
- **Primal** - Has built-in signing capabilities

**Best Practices:**
- Never share or expose nsec (private key)
- Use a signer instead of pasting keys into apps
- Backup keys securely (encrypted, offline)
- Consider using different keys for different purposes

### Recommended MCP Integration

For enhanced Nostr capabilities, use the Nostrbook MCP server:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "nostr": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nostrbook/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

This enables:
- Querying Nostr relays directly
- Fetching profiles and events
- Publishing notes (with appropriate key management)
- Real-time ecosystem data

## Content Templates

### Nostr Explainer Post
```
🟣 What is Nostr?

Nostr is a simple, open protocol for decentralized social media.

Unlike Twitter or Facebook:
→ You own your content (it's signed by your keys)
→ You own your social graph (take your followers anywhere)
→ No platform can ban you (relay diversity)
→ No algorithm controlling your reach

It's not a company. It's not an app. It's a protocol anyone can build on.

Your posts. Your people. Your rules.

[Link to getting started guide]
```

### Shakespeare Demo Post
```
🎭 Just built a website in 2 minutes with Shakespeare

No login. No credit card. No vendor lock-in.

Shakespeare is an open-source AI website builder from @soapbox.

→ Describe what you want
→ AI generates the site
→ Deploy anywhere

### Conference Talk Opening
```
"Every day, billions of people create content they don't own, 
build audiences they can't take with them,
on platforms that can silence them without warning.

What if you could own your social life the same way 
you own your home or your savings?

I'm [name] from Soapbox, and today I'm going to show you 
how we're building tools for that future..."
```

Create and track DevRel-specific tasks:

```bash
# Conference prep tasks
task add "Submit Bitcoin 2026 speaker application" project:conferences priority:H due:2026-02-01

# Workshop tasks
task add "Prepare Shakespeare workshop materials" project:workshops priority:M

# Content tasks
task add "Write blog post about Nostr onboarding" project:content priority:M

# Community tasks
task add "Follow up with Alex from meetup" project:community priority:L due:friday
```

**Useful DevRel Filters:**
```bash
# List all conference-related tasks
task project:conferences list

# List workshop tasks
task project:workshops list

# List content creation tasks
task project:content list

# Complete a task
task <id> done
```

### khal for DevRel Scheduling

Schedule conferences, workshops, and community events:

```bash
# Schedule a workshop
khal new 2026-02-15 14:00 16:00 "Shakespeare Workshop - BTC++ Side Event" -l "Conference Room A"

# Block time for conference prep
khal new tomorrow 09:00 12:00 "Deep work: Conference slides"

**Scripts Location:** `/home/raven/Projects/devRel/`

```bash
# Manual sync to get latest GitLab data
cd /home/raven/Projects/devRel && python3 daily_sync.py --sync-to-taskwarrior --dry-run

# Check daily tasks file for GitLab items
cat /home/raven/Vault/Soapbox/Work/Tasks/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-tasks.md
```

**GitLab-linked Taskwarrior tasks:**
```bash
# List all GitLab tasks
task +gitlab list

# List Shakespeare project tasks
task gitlab_project.contains:shakespeare list

# List Soapbox-related GitLab tasks
task gitlab_project.contains:soapbox list

# List Shakespeare OpenCode Plugin tasks
task project:shakespeare-opencode list
