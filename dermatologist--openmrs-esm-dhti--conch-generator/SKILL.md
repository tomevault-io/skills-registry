## Skill Purpose

DHTI is a platform to rapidly prototype, share, and test GenAI healthcare applications within an EHR. This skill guides you through:
- Setting up a development environment
- Scaffolding a new microfrontend project for GenAI powered backend services

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create a new OpenMRS ESM microfrontend from this template
- Build a DHTI-enabled healthcare application
- Integrate GenAI capabilities into an OpenMRS microfrontend
- Develop patient-context-aware UI components for OpenMRS

## Instructions

### Environment Setup and Project Scaffolding

* **Read and internalize the original user feature request:**
   - Understand the clinical functionality needed.
   - Identify the UI components, extensions, workflows, and pages required.
   - Note specific DHTI service name that needs to be used.

* **Decide on a simple but unique name** for your microfrontend. (e.g., glycemic, heart-rate, skin-tone etc.). IN THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW, REPLACE `<<name>>` WITH YOUR CHOSEN NAME.

* **Scaffold a new microfrontend project**: Copy packages/esm-starter-app to a new directory named `esm-dhti-<<name>>` inside the packages/ directory of the monorepo.
   - Update the `package.json` in `packages/esm-dhti-<<name>>`:
     - Change the `name` field to `@openmrs/esm-<<name>>`.
     - Update the `description`, `author`, and other relevant fields.

* **Adapt the code:**
   - In the packages/ directory of the monorepo, find your newly created microfrontend `esm-dhti-<<name>>`. THIS IS WHERE YOU WILL DO YOUR DEVELOPMENT.
    - Update `index.ts` as below:
     - Set the value of `moduleName` variable to `@openmrs/esm-<<name>>`.
     - Set the value of `featureName` variable to `dhti-<<name>>`.
   - Rename the `root.*` family of files to have the name of your first page (If applicable).
   - Update the contents of the objects in `config-schema.ts`. Start filling them back in once you have a clear idea what will need to be configured.
   - Update the contents of `translations/en.json`.
   - Update the contents of this README and write a short explanation of what you intend to build. Links to planning or design documents can be very helpful.

### Planning and Notes

* **Write detailed notes** on what you plan to implement, how you plan to implement it, and any questions or uncertainties you have. This will help guide your development process. Use the `workspace/openmrs-esm-dhti/notes/` directory for this purpose.

* **Plan UI components, extensions, workflows, and pages:**
    - Read and internalize https://r.jina.ai/https://o3-docs.openmrs.org/docs/frontend-modules/overview to understand how OpenMRS frontend modules work.
   - Read through the user requirements above again and plan the UI components, extensions, workflows, and pages you will need to implement the feature.
   - Write down a list of these components and their responsibilities in `workspace/openmrs-esm-dhti/notes/plan.md` for future reference.

### Routing and Extension Setup

* **Read `src/index.ts` again, and plan how to set up the extensions and routes for your microfrontend.**
   - The `index.ts` file in an OpenMRS frontend module typically includes the following:
     - **Imports:** Essential imports from `@openmrs/esm-framework` like `getSyncLifecycle`, `getAsyncLifecycle`, and `defineConfigSchema`. You may also import your React components here.
     - **Module and Feature Names:** Constants defining the unique `moduleName` (conventionally prefixed with `@openmrs/esm-`) and a descriptive `featureName`. You updated this before.
     - **startupApp function:** This function is the module's activator. It is often used to call `defineConfigSchema` to register the module's configuration schema with the system.
     - **Lifecycle Exports:** Components, pages, extensions, modals, or workspaces are wrapped in lifecycle functions (`getSyncLifecycle` or `getAsyncLifecycle`) and exported as named constants. These exports are then referenced in the `src/routes.json` file.
     - **Translation Support:** An `importTranslation` constant is used to tell the app shell where to find translation files, enabling internationalization.
     - Lifecycle functions may be synchronous (`getSyncLifecycle`) or asynchronous (`getAsyncLifecycle`) depending on whether the component requires async operations like data fetching.

* **Reference the component names in your `src/routes.json` file** to define routes or extensions. Read `notes/slots.md` to understand available extension slots. Update `src/routes.json` accordingly.

### Patient and Encounter Data in Components

* **Getting patient and encounter data in components:**
    - When an ESM is rendered inside a patient context (e.g., patient chart, visit workspace, form workspace), the framework automatically injects context props into your root component.
    - These props typically include:
      - `patient` (full patient object)
      - `patientUuid`
      - `encounterUuid` (when inside an encounter context)
      - `visitUuid` (when inside a visit context)
    - When a route is mounted under a patient or encounter workspace, the framework resolves context from the URL and global store.
    - You can access them in two ways:
      - **A. Direct Props (most common):**
        ```tsx
        export default function MyComponent({ patientUuid, encounterUuid }) {
            return (
                <div>
                    Patient: {patientUuid}
                    Encounter: {encounterUuid}
                </div>
            );
        }
        ```
      - **B. Using Framework Hooks:**
        ```tsx
        import { usePatient, useVisit, useEncounter } from "@openmrs/esm-framework";

        const MyComponent = () => {
            const patient = usePatient();
            const encounter = useEncounter();

            console.log(patient?.uuid);
            console.log(encounter?.uuid);

            return <div>...</div>;
        };
        ```

### GenAI Outputs

* **Getting GenAI outputs:**
    - Use the `useDhti` route from the monorepo (esm-dhti-utils) to call the DHTI service and get GenAI outputs. You need to update the DHTI service route (dhtiRoute) in the config-schema.ts file. If the user has not provided it above, ask for it using a prompt.
    If the user has only provided the DHTI service name, construct the full route as follows: http://localhost:8001/langserve/dhti_elixir_<service-name>/cds-services/dhti-service. Otherwise use the default value as 'http://localhost:8001/langserve/dhti_elixir_schat/cds-services/dhti-service'

### Implementation

* **Implement the feature:**
    - Start implementing the feature based on your plans. Follow best practices for React and OpenMRS frontend-module development. When you are in doubt refer to the implementation guide here: https://r.jina.ai/https://o3-docs.openmrs.org/docs/frontend-modules/overview. Test your code frequently to ensure it works as expected.

### Testing

* **Write tests:**
    - Write unit and integration tests for your components and logic. Use the testing framework set up in the template. Ensure good test coverage to catch potential issues early.
    - Use yarn to build and test your microfrontend:
      ```bash
      cd packages/esm-dhti-<<name>>
      yarn build
      yarn test
      ```

### Documentation

* **Update documentation:**
    - Update the `README.md` with details about your microfrontend, including its purpose, setup instructions, and usage. Document any configuration options in `config-schema.ts`. Extended notes and future plans can go in the `workspace/openmrs-esm-dhti/notes/` directory.

### Final Review and Cleanup

* **Final review and cleanup:**
    - Review your code for any unused imports, variables, or commented-out code. Ensure your code follows consistent styling and conventions. Run the application to do a final test of all features and ensure everything works as expected.
