# tmux-pair-orchestration

Run a single coding agent on a task. The agent lives in its own tmux pane in a fresh `git worktree`, executes a 7-phase gated workflow, and uses subagents plus `codex exec` for adversarial review at each gate.

This skill applies whenever the user wants to set up such a run, monitor it, draft briefings, recover from a stuck loop, or do the post-merge retro. The default entry-point is `/run`.

## The mode

Solo is the only mode. One agent, one pane, one worktree.

Multi-pane spawn modes (separate writer + reviewer panes, dual-review with two reviewer panes, parallel-writers with two writer panes) were removed in 0.18.0. They consistently lost on:

- **Cargo target contention** under shared CARGO_TARGET_DIR; cold-cache rebuilds and llvm-cov ran twice
- **Git index lock races**: parallel writers fighting `git add` produced cross-bullet commit pollution (e.g. one writer's 12k target-cov files landing in another writer's commit)
- **PROJECT.md cross-writer races**: two writers updating the same active roadmap section forced reactive plan-amendments
- **Dual-review coordination overhead**: per-bullet swap + peer-review + orchestrator-consolidate eats more wall-time than the extra review-quality buys at 15+ bullet sweeps
- **Pane-readiness races** at boot (70s timeout, manual rebrief common)

Adversarial review-quality is preserved by parallel two-mind gates inside the single pane: a claude subagent (`Agent(gate-2-plan-check)` etc.) plus `codex exec` (out-of-process, fresh context, different model family). Two independent minds without the coordination tax.

Default agent: `claude` (recon-strong, follows briefings, integrates plan + subagent feedback cleanly). `/run` picks dynamically between `claude` and `codex` based on the task profile when the user does not pass `--agent` explicitly; `pi` is opt-in only. Reviewer subagents run at top reasoning tier regardless of solo agent's budget.

Agent pick heuristic (used by `/run`):

| Task profile | Pick | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Recon-heavy, multi-file, plan-integration, AskUserQuestion-heavy, design work, briefings, greenfield scaffolding, compliance/PII | `claude` | Plan integration + Subagent-Spawn (Task tool) + AskUserQuestion structured. Default tie-breaker. |
| Single-file edits, code translation (lang A → B), mechanic refactor, bulk-rename, codemod | `codex` | Terminal-driven, direct file-ops, fast turnaround per file. |
| Adversarial bug-hunt, debugging mystery panics, race-condition tracing, "find the real cause" | `codex` | gpt-5.5 + xhigh reasoner sharp on adversarial logic. |
| Cost-sensitive bulk work (mass renames, mechanic migrations) | `pi` (opt-in via `--agent pi`) | Cortecs/qwen3 fits bulk; expensive top-tier models would burn budget. |

Ambiguous → `claude` (safer default). User can override anytime with `--agent codex` / `--agent pi`. The picked agent is surfaced in the `/run` recon note.

**Same heuristic applies to subagent spawns inside the solo run.** The solo agent has two subagent mechanisms with different strength profiles, and picks per task:

| Mechanism | Tool | Strength profile |
|---|---|---|
| claude subagent | `Agent(general-purpose)` or `Agent(<repo>-*)` (Task tool) | Plan-integration, multi-step recon with `AskUserQuestion` chaining, design + briefing-driven impl, structured output (XML / JSON / markdown), repo-domain experts (`.claude/agents/<repo>-*.md`). |
| codex subagent | `Bash(codex exec --skip-git-repo-check --cd <wt> "...")` | Single-file edits, code translation, mechanic refactors, codemods, adversarial bug-hunt, race-condition tracing, "find the real cause" prompts (gpt-5.5 + xhigh). Out-of-process, no context pollution. |

Per phase:

- **Phase 1 (Recon)**: usually `claude` subagents (4-6 parallel `Agent` calls). One `Bash(codex exec "recon-attack")` in parallel for second-opinion when the task is ambiguous or domain-unfamiliar.
- **Phase 3 (Implementation)**: parallel sub-bullets → pick per bullet profile.
  - Recon-heavy / multi-file / plan-driven bullet → `Agent` in a sub-worktree.
  - Single-file mechanic / codemod / lang-translation bullet → `Bash(codex exec --cd <sub-wt> "<task>")`. Lean, no setup, direct file-ops.
  - Adversarial bug-hunt sub-bullet → codex exec.
  - Sequential bullet stays in the main pane (no subagent).
- **Phase 2/4 (Gates)**: already parallel both-minds (claude `Agent` + codex `Bash(codex exec)`). No new pick logic needed.
- **Phase 5 (Persist) / Phase 7 (Auto-Squash-Merge)**: no subagents, main pane handles directly.

Default tie-breaker for subagents stays `claude` (recon-strong, structured). Codex picks itself when the profile is mechanic / single-file / adversarial: those are codex's home turf.

## Solo workflow (7 phases)

1. **Recon**: 4-6 parallel subagent spawns. Domain-experts when `.claude/agents/<repo>-*.md` exists; `Explore` otherwise. Each subagent <300 words with `file:line` pointers. Adds `MEMORY.md` freshness check (>3 day old memory files = stale-risk flag).
2. **Plan + GATE-2 Plan-Check**: bullet plan with parallel/sequential markers, then TWO independent adversarial checks in parallel:
   - `Agent(gate-2-plan-check)` (claude, adversarial, scoped read-only)
   - `Bash(codex exec --skip-git-repo-check "adversarial plan-attack against <plan>")` (codex, different model family, fresh context)
   Both must return PASS or WARNING-only. BLOCKER in either → fix-loop. Max 3 plan iterations; iteration 4+ asks the user.
3. **Implementation**: agent codes directly. Per-bullet runs nextest + clippy + per-crate gates inline. PROJECT.md care for feature/refactor bullets that change package map, feature surface, design decisions, or implementation history.
4. **GATE-3 Final-Verify**: THREE independent adversarial checks in parallel:
   - `Agent(gate-3-verifier)` (claude, Haiku 4.5, goal-backward against plan)
   - `Agent(gate-3-code-reviewer)` (claude, Sonnet 4.6, adversarial diff review)
   - `Bash(codex exec "adversarial diff-review against main..HEAD")` (codex)
   BLOCKER in any → fix-loop. WARNING-only → proceed with documented follow-up. Max 3 review cycles.
5. **PROJECT.md + Skill-Persist**: phase block in PROJECT.md, design decisions, domain knowledge as Skill under `.claude/skills/<repo>-<topic>/SKILL.md` (Persist-Convention; Rules only for cross-cutting always-on items).
6. **Commit**: per-bullet conventional commits (no AI co-author), per-crate gates green, worktree clean. No DONE ping before Phase 7 has finished.
7. **Auto-Squash-Merge + Cleanup**: solo squashes all bullet commits into one commit on `<base>`, deletes the feature branch, removes the worktree, then pings `DONE-MERGED`. Sequential chained runs always start from clean base. Steps the solo executes itself:
   - `git -C <project> status --porcelain` -> must be empty (else BLOCKER)
   - `git -C <project> checkout <base>`
   - `git -C <project> merge --squash <branch>`
   - `git -C <project> commit` (heredoc message: one-line subject + bullet body + decisions + test counts)
   - `git -C <project> branch -D <branch>`
   - `git -C <project> worktree remove <wt_path>` (skipped if `--no-worktree`)
   - `DONE-MERGED solo.<feature>: <squash-sha> on <base>` ping
   - Merge conflict in Phase 7 -> AskUserQuestion in own pane with the concrete error and 2-4 recovery options (rebase + retry, abort, manual resolve + retry). No BLOCKER ping to master. See SOLO USER INPUT RULE in the briefing.

Default flag set: `--no-gated` for trivial tasks where subagent-driven recon/plan/review is overkill (e.g. doc tweak, single-file rename). Gated is the default. Worktree is the default; `--no-worktree` opts out.

### Repo-specific subagents (auto-detected)

When the script sees `.claude/agents/<repo>-*.md` files in the target repo, it lists them in the briefing. The solo briefing instructs the agent to prefer those domain experts over `general-purpose` for Recon/Impl/Review subagent spawns. They know the repo's domain vocabulary, architecture constraints, and skill files.

Detection logic: filename stem starting with `<project.name>-` (e.g. `example-repo-kernel.md` in an `example-repo` repo). Falls back to "no repo-subagents listed" if the directory is missing or empty.

### Codex-CLI integration concrete

`codex exec --skip-git-repo-check --cd <wt>` is invoked by the solo agent via Bash for plan-attack and diff-review gates. The agent passes the plan or diff as part of the prompt; codex runs read-only, returns VERDICT=PASS|WARNING|BLOCKER plus falsifiable findings to stdout. The solo agent reads stdout, integrates findings with the claude-subagent verdict, and decides loop/proceed.

Sample shape for the plan-attack call:

```bash
codex exec --skip-git-repo-check --cd <wt> "$(cat <<'EOF'
Adversarial plan reviewer. Read PLAN.md and the proposed bullet list.
Report VERDICT=PASS|WARNING|BLOCKER with falsifiable findings (file:line,
problem, fix-direction). Read-only. No edits.
EOF
)"
```

## /run auto-entry

`/run <project> <base> <feature> [task]` is the default entry-point. It performs a short clarify + repo recon, then invokes solo.

Decision logic:

1. **Task clarification**: if `<task>` is missing or ambiguous, ask once via `AskUserQuestion`.
2. **Repo recon**: inspect size, language stack, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/rules/`, grep for keywords from `<task>` to estimate affected file count.
3. **Pre-pick sensible solo flags**: `--with-standards` for repos lacking explicit rules, `--greenfield` for completely fresh repos.
4. **Invoke solo** with the resolved flags.

There is no spawn-mode anymore. All `/solo` flags are forwarded.

## Bullet-Sweep Sizing

Plan-drift correlates strongly with bullet count in one run.

| Bullet count | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| 1-3 | solo, monolithic |
| 4-10 | solo, monolithic, gated |
| 11+ | chain 3-5-bullet solo runs back-to-back, each its own squash-merge + retro |

For an 11+ sweep: do a pre-plan triage of all candidate bullets into four classes:

| Class | Per-bullet review pattern |
|---|---|
| Code-fix (real change) | full GATE-2 + GATE-3 + codex-CLI second-opinion |
| Verify-absent (already fixed in earlier phase) | rg-evidence in REVIEW-READY, single-pass verifier check |
| Doc-only (PROJECT.md, comment, skill text) | bundled with other doc-only bullets, one PROJECT.md-closeout review |
| Won't-fix (technically impossible or out-of-scope) | plan-amendment commit with rationale, no implementation |

Run one solo per class-batch (or split code-fix into 3-5-bullet sub-batches). Avoid the monolithic 22-bullet run.

## Durable standards

Standards survive `/compact` and context resets because they sit in the system prompt, not in the briefing user-message that gets summarised on compaction. Briefings are slim by default: task-focused and compact.

- **claude panes** boot with `--append-system-prompt-file <path>` pointing at `/tmp/tmux-pair-durable-<window>-<role>.md`. The file is generated per-spawn from a single in-script constant (`DURABLE_STANDARDS_PROMPT`) so updates to standards land in the next spawn automatically.
- **codex panes** read `AGENTS.md` from the worktree root. The plugin writes that file when a real worktree is created (i.e. not when `--no-worktree` is passed). If the repo already owns an `AGENTS.md`, the plugin leaves it alone: repo standards win.
- **pi panes** boot with `--append-system-prompt <path>` (a third-party custom CLI, config under `~/.pi/agent/`). pi reads `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` via default discovery, so the codex path works transitively. Default model `qwen3-coder-next` via default provider `cortecs`, default `--thinking high`. Override per spawn via `--pi-provider`, `--pi-model`, `--pi-thinking`. Known limits: no mid-session `/model` switch (pane-restart required), no `/compact` equivalent (Compact-Watcher does not ping pi panes).
- **`--with-standards`** appends the durable standards bundle (reviewer standards, recall discipline, bullet-start ritual).
- **`--greenfield`** enables `--with-standards` plus greenfield pre-flight.
- **`--no-worktree`**: if codex is the solo agent, standards are auto-enabled in the briefing so codex still receives durable standards context.
- **`agents.json` overrides** are respected: if the user has remapped `claude`, the plugin does NOT inject `--append-system-prompt-file` blindly. The wrapper can read the standards file itself.

The standards block covers: real Umlaute (no ASCII substitutes), Conventional Commits with no `--no-verify` and no AI-co-author trailer, the REVIEW-READY 3-field format, the honesty protocol (past-tense claims need same-turn tool evidence), drift signals (em-dashes, progress markers, ALL-CAPS headers, "should I"-after-clear-directive), the `incidental:` format for PostToolUse-hook fmt drift, the worktree-as-sandbox rule, the no-pre-existing-issues rule, recall-discipline (cite the relevant rule + memory before sensitive actions), and the bullet-start ritual (class + relevant rules + common BLOCKER-classes before the first edit on a bullet).

## Gated workflow (default)

```
Recon -> GATE 1 Clarify -> GATE 1.5 Reviewer-Readiness -> Plan -> GATE 2 Plan-Check -> Implementation Loop -> GATE 3 Final-Verify -> Commit -> Auto-Squash-Merge (Phase 7) -> DONE-MERGED -> Post-Merge Retro
```

- **GATE 1 (Clarify)**. The solo agent calls `AskUserQuestion` directly. The human only sees a `GATE-1-ESCALATE` if a question is outside the agent's authority.
- **GATE 1.5 (Reviewer-Readiness)**: one scoped subagent (`tmux-pair:reviewer-readiness-check`, Sonnet 4.6, Read+Grep+Glob+Bash, NO Edit/Write) reads `.claude/rules/*.md` and scores an 8-item checklist (style, tests, architecture, anti-patterns, naming, security, build, domain). On `NEEDS-RULES`, the agent runs a bootstrap loop: per gap one `AskUserQuestion`, then `tmux-pair:rules-bootstrap` bakes `.claude/rules/<topic>.md` from plugin language templates + repo recon + user answers, then re-run readiness-check. Loop terminates at READY or after iteration 3 with user-decided abort/partial-coverage/manual-amend. Optional opt-in `/gepa` pass after fresh rules; the plugin does not call `/gepa` automatically.
- **GATE 2 (Plan-Check)**: parallel two-mind check. `Agent(gate-2-plan-check)` (Sonnet 4.6, scoped read-only) verifies the plan goal-backward AND checks plan quality. Every bullet must carry either a parallel marker (`B3 || B4 [parallel]`) or a sequencing marker (`B3 -> B4 [sequential: shared file]`). In parallel: `Bash(codex exec "adversarial plan-attack")` for second-opinion. `BLOCKER` in either escalates to the agent's fix-loop; both PASS or WARNING-only proceeds.
- **Implementation Loop**: solo writes + per-bullet self-review via `Agent(gate-3-code-reviewer)` when bullets are non-trivial. Per-bullet test-budget is crate-scoped (`cargo nextest -p <crate>`, never `--workspace`). PROJECT.md care for feature and refactor bullets. The solo agent uses subagents for parallel recon, parallel test suites, and independent fix branches when that keeps the main pane lean.
- **GATE 3 (Final-Verify)**. Three parallel adversarial checks: `Agent(gate-3-verifier)` (Haiku 4.5, goal-backward against plan, runs build/test, checks plan-bullet coverage and PROJECT.md care), `Agent(gate-3-code-reviewer)` (Sonnet 4.6, adversarial diff review), and `Bash(codex exec "diff-review")` (codex, second-opinion). All PASS or WARNING-only: solo proceeds to Phase 5 (Persist), Phase 6 (Commit), and Phase 7 (Auto-Squash-Merge + DONE-MERGED). No interim ping to the human.

The implementation loop adds six protocol elements:

- **REVIEW-READY 3 mandatory fields**: every `REVIEW-READY:` ping carries (1) what changed (file:line + LOC-diff), (2) verification (`crate-gate=PASS` + test counts, or `crate-gate=N/A doc-only`), (3) plan-bullet/pain reference. Pings without these fields are blocked.
- **CLARIFY-NEEDED**. When the agent hits a user-decision question mid-loop (scope, behavior, UX, architecture choice, naming conflict, trade-off not in the plan), it calls `AskUserQuestion` directly with 2-4 options. Engineers do NOT decide user-facing questions on their own.
- **Plan-Update-Commit**. If a bullet hits a hard cap (LOC limit, file-size cap) or the estimate drifts more than ~50%, the agent commits a `docs(plan-amendment): ...` BEFORE the implementation commit that breaks the cap. A bullet with documented drift but no preceding amendment commit fails verifier.
- **Parallel markers**. Plans mark independent bullets as `B3 || B4 [parallel]` and ordered bullets as `B3 -> B4 [sequential: <reason>]`. GATE 2 blocks missing markers.
- **PROJECT.md care**. The agent updates project-local `PROJECT.md` for feature and refactor bullets that change package map, feature surface, design decisions, or implementation history. Reviewers sign off on the update or on a justified skip for refactor, test, or docs-only bullets with no feature-surface change. If no `PROJECT.md` exists, the agent asks whether to bootstrap a human-maintained skeleton. Use the PROJECT.md in your own repo (or this plugin's PROJECT.md, if present) as the format and detail-depth reference.
- **COMPLETE marker (internal phase log)**. After GATE 3 returns PASS the solo agent emits a one-line COMPLETE marker in its own output: `COMPLETE: <Phase>. gate-3=PASS via <verifier-name + code-reviewer-name + codex-cli>. <diff-stat>. Reference: <plan goals all met>.` Logged in own pane for the human reader and for the eventual squash-commit body. Never sent as a back-channel ping; DONE-MERGED at Phase 7 is the only back-channel signal.
- **Recall-Discipline + Bullet-Start-Ritual**: cite the relevant rule + memory entry before any sensitive action (commit, push, external API), and post a class + rules + common BLOCKER-classes block before the first edit on each new plan-bullet.

Cross-cutting:

- **Plan quality is enforced.** A skeletal "implement X" plan blocks at GATE 2.
- **Context economy applies.** Heavy research, deep codebase reads, and web lookups go to subagents (one message, multiple parallel Task calls when independent). Diff-first reviews. Targeted Read-ranges over full-file dumps.
- **Edit efficiency is part of the plan.** Pattern replace at >3 sites is a `sed`-job. Boilerplate generation = template + substitution. The plan names the tool.
- **Few, descriptive commits.** The agent commits at logical-step granularity during the loop; the human squashes before merge to `main`. Commit messages must be substantial enough that a meaningful squash message can be distilled.

Greenfield repos (no `CLAUDE.md`, no `.claude/rules/`) are handled by GATE 1.5 automatically: the readiness-check returns `NEEDS-RULES` with all 8 topics as gaps, the bootstrap loop generates the full rules set from plugin templates + user answers + repo recon, and the agent proceeds only AFTER rules exist. Plan stays focused on the actual feature work; rules-generation is no longer a plan bullet.

Full workflow with subagent prompt templates, gate event vocabulary, and failure modes in `references/gated-workflow.md`.

## Smart workflow (V1-V10)

The workflow is unattended by default. The agent handles small, reversible decisions inside the documented threshold, logs every self-decision in `COMPLETE` AND persists every self-decision in the consumer repo's `PROJECT.md` under Implementation History. Only pauses for decisions that change scope, budget, external dependencies, or security posture. Pass `--interactive` when the user wants every self-decision to become a pause point.

### V1 Inline-Fix-for-Trivial-Findings

When a self-review subagent surfaces a trivial finding under 20 LOC and clearly isolated (cosmetic, typo, missing doc), the agent applies it silently instead of escalating to the user. Anti-trigger: architecture, security, test-logic, >20 LOC.

### V2 Direct-Decision-Threshold

| Decision class | Default action |
|---|---|
| Style finding already APPROVE-worthy | Self-decide and log rationale in `COMPLETE`. |
| Test coverage edge case with clear risk assessment | Self-decide and log the risk note. |
| Optional-vs-required default with existing repo precedent | Self-decide by repo pattern. |
| Naming convention with repo-pattern match | Self-decide by local convention. |
| Plan revision after GATE-2-BLOCKER with clear fix direction | Self-decide and send the revised plan. |
| Budget, stakeholder approval, external service status, real scope expansion, security trade-off | Escalate to the user. |

Every self-decision is recorded in the final `COMPLETE` ping as a one-line rationale AND persisted as a row in the consumer repo's `PROJECT.md` under a new Implementation-History phase heading (phase marker, anchor SHA, Markdown table `ID | Decision | Rationale`). A run is not considered complete without the `PROJECT.md` entry.

### V3 Adaptive GATE-Strictness

`task_kind` has three classes: `bug-fix`, `feature`, `refactor`. The agent classifies during recon and passes to GATE 2 + GATE 3 subagents.

| task_kind | Subagent impact |
|---|---|
| `bug-fix` | Keep core coverage, specificity, rules, plan quality, test checks active. Skip wiring, parallel markers, UI-smoke, PROJECT.md only for one-file fixes with no new surface. |
| `feature` | Default strictness. All checklist items stay active. |
| `refactor` | Treat coverage as preservation, tests as regression evidence. Skip wiring + UI-smoke if no behavior/UI surface change. Keep design-decision + implementation-history checks. |

### V4 Auto-Resolve WARNINGs

GATE 3 verdicts use three severities: BLOCKER (correctness, security, maintainability, project-rule violation, dirty worktree, failed verification → fix-loop), WARNING (preference or nice-to-have → may ignore, follow-up-memory recorded), NOTE (info-only).

### V5 Unattended-Default

Default mode is unattended. Without `--interactive`, V2 self-decisions proceed autonomously and are logged in both `COMPLETE` and `PROJECT.md`. With `--interactive`, the agent pauses before every self-decision and asks the user via `AskUserQuestion`.

### V6 Readiness-Cache (24h TTL)

`reviewer-readiness-check` is cached. Cache key: `sha256(.claude/rules/*.md content)` + commit-sha. Cache-hit (file exists + mtime < 24h + verdict=PASS): skip the subagent. Cache-miss / STALE: normal subagent spawn; PASS verdict gets cached atomically. `NEEDS-RULES` is never cached. Cache-bust: `--no-cache`.

### V7 Test-Trust-Chain (TESTS-PROOF marker)

Writer-DONE is extended with a structured commit-body marker:

```
TESTS-PROOF:
  <test-cmd>: PASS (<N> tests)
  <lint-cmd>: clean
  <fmt-cmd>: clean
  COMMIT_SHA: <sha-of-HEAD-at-test-time>
```

`gate-3-verifier` reads it via `git log -1 --format=%B`. HEAD == COMMIT_SHA: trust, skip re-run. HEAD moved: WARNING + re-run. No marker on 0.14+: BLOCKER. Marker present pre-0.14: WARNING legacy.

### Per-Worktree Cargo Target (since 0.22.1)

`tmux_pair.py` prepends `env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=~/.cache/tmux-pair/cargo-target/<repo-slug>__<wt-slug>/` to the boot command when the project is a Cargo workspace. Each worktree gets its own target directory, so parallel solos on the same project never block on cargo's file-lock. Trade-off: cold rebuild per worktree (a few minutes amortised against a 30..90 min solo run). Pass `--shared-target` to opt back into the legacy single-shared-target behaviour (`<repo-slug>/`) when only one agent is active and maximum cache warmth matters. Non-Cargo repos skip the env entirely.

### V9 Recon-Cache with Delta-Mode (1h TTL)

Recon output (file map, crate list, PROJECT.md snapshot, key-function inventory) cached at `/tmp/tmux-pair-recon-<repo-slug>-<commit-sha>.json`. Subsequent runs on the same commit within 1h read the cache, then delta-recon for files with `mtime > cache-time`. Cache-bust: `--no-cache`.

### V10 Inline-Gates for Trivial Plans

`task_kind=bug-fix` AND `plan-bullets <= 3` AND `predicted files-touched <= 5`: the agent runs GATE 2 inline in its own context with the 8-item checklist instead of spawning the subagent. `gate-3-verifier` may also run inline when the same trivial-plan condition holds AND the TESTS-PROOF marker is valid for HEAD. `gate-3-code-reviewer` always stays in a subagent. Anti-triggers (force subagent): dirty worktree, formatter failures, ambiguous plan text, `task_kind` in (`feature`, `refactor`). Helper: `python3 scripts/tmux_pair.py inline-gate-decide --plan-file <path> --task-kind bug-fix`.

## Layout

Single pane in the worktree window. No layout-forcing.

## Quick start

```
/run    <project-path> <base> <feature> [task...]
/solo   <project-path> <base> <feature> [task...]
```

The script:

1. Creates a sibling worktree at `<project-parent>/<project-basename>-wt-<feature>`, branch `feature/<feature>`, from `<base>`. If the branch already exists, it is reused.
2. Opens a tmux window named `<project-basename>-<feature>` (truncated to 30 chars).
3. Spawns the agent pane.
4. Schedules the briefing via `sleep 14 && send`, so the agent has time to boot before the message lands.
5. Prints a JSON receipt with the pane id.

## Briefing template

`examples/solo-briefing.md` is the starting template (pointers, deliverables, gates, standards). The bundled script generates a baseline briefing automatically; the template is useful when overriding or hand-authoring after recon.

## Sending messages

The cross-pane primitive is `tmux_pair.py send`:

```
python3 <plugin>/scripts/tmux_pair.py send <pane-id> "<message>"
```

Multi-line messages are submitted via `load-buffer` + `paste-buffer` to avoid the issue where some agent TUIs interpret each newline as a submit. Single-line messages use plain `send-keys -l`. After the text, the helper sends Enter three times with small gaps; this works around agent TUIs that ignore the first Enter when a tool call is in flight. Override with `--no-enter` if needed.

Normal messages get a sender identity prefix automatically. Example: `wr.<feature>` sending `REVIEW-READY: ...` arrives as `[FROM: wr.<feature>] REVIEW-READY: ...`. Messages already starting with `[FROM:` are left unchanged. Slash commands such as `/compact <focus>` are command traffic and are not prefixed. Spawned panes store their stable sender name in `@tmux-pair-sender`.

### Codex file-bridge for long messages (since 0.22.2)

The codex TUI input widget glitches when very long text is pasted into it (visible artifacts: half-rendered lines, mis-wrapped boxes, stuck spinner). For codex panes we skip the paste entirely and route long bodies through a tempfile.

- **Initial briefings**: `cmd_solo` and `cmd_spawn` detect the pane's agent and call `_send_briefing_for_agent`. For `codex`, the briefing body is written to `/tmp/tmux-pair-msg-XXXX.md` and a short pointer message is sent into the pane instead: *"Your next instruction is too long to paste safely into the codex TUI. It has been written to /tmp/... Please read that file now and execute its contents as your next instruction. After processing, delete the file with `rm /tmp/...`."* Codex reads the file via its built-in shell tool and processes the briefing.
- **Re-briefs and plan-updates**: `tmux_pair.py send <pane> --from-file <path>` reads the body from a file. When the target pane runs codex AND the body is multi-line, the helper auto-routes through the same file-bridge.
- **claude / pi panes**: unchanged. Their input widgets handle long pastes via `load-buffer` + `paste-buffer` without rendering bugs, so the direct send path stays.
- **Agent lookup**: every spawned pane stores its agent in the `@tmux-pair-agent` tmux pane option at spawn time. `cmd_send` reads it to decide.

The tempfile is left as-is if codex does not delete it; `/tmp` clears on reboot. The file is world-readable by design so a human can `less` it for debugging.

## Token management and re-briefs

Default claude model: `claude-opus-4-7` (1M context). For 200k-context runs, use `--claude-model claude-opus-4-6`. Compact-watcher threshold scales automatically: 1M → 700k (70%), 200k → 140k.

Default reasoning effort: `xhigh` on both harnesses for the main pane AND reviewer subagents (codex gpt-5.5 supports xhigh). Override with `--claude-effort`, `--codex-effort`, `--reviewer-claude-effort`, `--reviewer-codex-effort`.

Long-running runs drift past the model's sweet spot. Helper subcommands:

```
python3 <plugin>/scripts/tmux_pair.py status <pane-id>
python3 <plugin>/scripts/tmux_pair.py compact <pane-id> --briefing-file <path> [--focus "<one-liner>"]
python3 <plugin>/scripts/tmux_pair.py monitor --orch-pane <id> --panes <id> [--threshold-k <N>]
```

Solo does not auto-start the watcher: the agent self-compacts between phases when appropriate.

**Self-compact pattern**: write a self-re-brief file at `/tmp/self-compact-<window>.md` (plan-bullet, current state, next step, relevant standards), send `/compact <focus>` to own pane, after settle read the file and continue.

## Common failure modes

The full list lives in `references/failure-modes.md`. The most common:

- **Send didn't submit.** Symptom: message visible in pane but cursor still in input. Cause: agent TUI ignored the Enter. Fix: re-send with the helper, which retries Enter.
- **Briefing landed before agent booted.** Symptom: message appears at the shell prompt instead of inside the TUI. Cause: 14-second delay too short. Fix: re-send manually after the agent is ready.
- **tmux session crashed mid-run.** Symptom: panes gone, worktree intact. Recovery: re-spawn the pane manually, point it at the existing worktree, re-send the briefing with the current state attached.
- **Pushed without human OK.** Symptom: `git push` happened despite the brief saying "wait for human". Cause: briefing missing or weakly worded. Fix: spell out the push gate explicitly in the briefing template.

## Post-Merge Retro (mandatory)

Default workflow after the solo agent sends `DONE-MERGED`. Phase 7 of the solo workflow has already executed the squash-merge, branch delete, and worktree remove. The retro step remains:

1. **Retro**: the orchestrator sends a tailored retro question to the solo pane (via `tmux_pair.py send`; the pane is still alive after Phase 7) AND spawns 2-3 `Agent` personas in parallel with different perspectives (orchestrator view, writer view, reviewer view), plus one `codex exec "retro"` for an independent fourth view. Expect 200-500 words of factual analysis per source (no praise, weaknesses stated directly). Topics:

   - Phase wall-clock per 7-phase step
   - GATE-2 iterations and which mid-run self-decisions could have been prevented at plan-write time
   - Drive-by / reactive commit share
   - Structural plan errors
   - Hardest test pattern, fmt-drift root cause, Pre-Flight gaps
   - Bullet-count retro (was monolithic correct, or too large?)
   - Phase 7 conflicts and cleanup friction

2. **Pattern synthesis + persist**: the orchestrator collects the retros, identifies recurring issue classes (decorator-swallow, cancellation-root-mismatch, fmt-drift, plan-vs-reality-mismatch), and persists:
   - tmux-pair skill (this file): when the pattern is workflow-cross-cutting (Pre-Flight class, plan-drift indicator).
   - Consumer repo: `.claude/rules/*.md` (always-on cross-cutting) or `.claude/skills/<repo>-<topic>/SKILL.md` (path-scoped domain) per Persist-Convention.

3. **Window cleanup**: after pattern-persist:

```bash
tmux kill-window -t <window-name>
```

Worktree and branch are gone since Phase 7; only the tmux window remains for the retro. The retro step is mandatory, not optional. A solo run without a retro fails to persist the most expensive learnings of the run.

## Recurring Pre-Flight Checks (aggregated from retros)

These checks belong in `--with-standards` briefings AND in consumer-repo `.claude/rules/pre-flight-checklists.md`. Aggregated from multiple solo retros, all falsifiable:

- **Decorator-Sweep before Trait-Default-Add**: when adding a default-body trait method (especially lifecycle methods like `shutdown`/`close`/`flush`), run `rg "impl <Trait> for" --type rust` before REVIEW-READY, list every implementor, mark each one with two or more forward methods as a decorator, and either add an explicit forward override OR document a no-op rationale in a plan-amendment. Anti-pattern: trait-default no-op is silently swallowed by a decorator.

- **Trait-Param-Honor check**: a trait-method param prefixed with `_` (`_grace`, `_token`) while the trait doc declares the param effective is a silent-discard footgun. Pre-flight: `rg '_[a-z]+: ' <trait-file>` cross-checked against the trait doc. The default body should either honestly ignore the param (and the doc gets updated) or honor it (with a test).

- **Method-Resolution-Collision check**: a new trait method with the same name as an existing inherent impl on an implementor: pre-flight `cargo check -p <crate>` surfaces the ambiguity warning. Anti-pattern: the trait method is silently shadowed by the inherent method.

- **Format-gate discipline**: a writer claim of "fmt clean" requires `cargo fmt -p <crate> --check` (NOT `cargo fmt -p <crate>` without `--check`). Per-crate fmt without `--check` silently rewrites neighbor files and produces drive-by drift. Falsifiable: REVIEW-READY with "fmt clean" plus `--check` output and exit 0.

- **Mechanical lint-fix pass BEFORE manual LLM edits (hard rule)**: every clippy-cleanup bullet MUST start with `cargo clippy -p <crate> --fix --allow-dirty --lib --bins --examples -- -D warnings` AND the test-target variant. `--fix` clears 60-90% of the typical lints (format-args inlining, use-statement cleanup, `&` redundancy, `into()` casts, needless-borrow, redundant-clone) deterministically and idempotently in about a second. Doing this work with LLM edits is pure waste: 15 Edit calls plus 15 LLM round-trips for something `cargo clippy --fix` finishes in one shell call. Recurring drift: solo did manual edits on format macros and use-imports instead of running the `--fix` pass first. Falsifiable: for every clippy bullet the REVIEW-READY ping MUST cite the `--fix` pass output (even if zero changes) BEFORE the manual fixes. The tool-use log shows `Bash(cargo clippy --fix ...)` before any `Edit` call that touches a clippy-pattern (format-arg, use-cleanup, needless-borrow, etc.). Missing = BLOCK from gate-3-code-reviewer.

- **Memory-Recon as a mandatory RECON step**: before plan-write, read `MEMORY.md` plus the 3-5 most relevant memory files under `~/.claude/projects/<repo>/memory/`. Mid-run self-decisions that would have been preventable by memory-recon are a drift indicator. **Memory-Freshness Gate**: memory files older than 3 days are a stale-risk flag; the plan-recon must state whether memory was re-validated against current code.

- **Brief-vs-Reality validation before Plan-Lock**: a brief written against an old code state is the most common plan-drift source. Before Plan-Lock: run `cargo clippy -p <crate>` plus `git grep -n "<keyword>"` plus `rg`-evidence for every "verify-first" or "should-be-X" item in the brief. Falsifiable: the Plan-Lock commit cites at least two brief items with current-code evidence SHAs.

- **Target-dir hygiene before llvm-cov**: `.gitignore` contains `target-cov/` (and similar tool-output dirs) BEFORE the first `cargo llvm-cov` runs. Reactive fix after a crash costs 30+ minutes of recovery.

- **Cross-boundary checks for tool / mcp / hook crates**: on top of the backend-bullet class, a cross-boundary class triggers as soon as the diff touches `<repo>-tool-*`, `<repo>-mcp-*`, or `<repo>-hook-*` crates with message mutation. Three falsifiable checks: (1) tool-output audit (`rg "reqwest::Error|reqwest::Url|::Url\b" <touched-crate>/src/` plus a visual audit of all `output:` / `Value::String(...)` sites in the error path), (2) provider-turn alternation (any hook that returns `Decision::Replace(Vec<Message>)` or `Decision::Inject(Message)` MUST keep user/assistant alternation; test against `validate_turn_sequence(&msgs)`), (3) cap single-source (exactly one enforcing site per resource cap per call-path). Pattern from a past mcp-split retro: url-leak, double-validation, and broken apology-turn alternation only surfaced in the adversarial gate.

## Build / compile-speed findings (mcp-split retro)

From a bench pass at the end of a recent mcp-split round. Single-crate compile/link on macOS is NOT the dominant bottleneck:

| Configuration | Wallclock (example-crate nextest) |
|---|---:|
| Baseline warm | 3.54s |
| Touch-rebuild | 4.01s |
| Cold-clean | 4.60s |
| sccache + CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 warm cache | 2.56s |
| lld swap | 26.22s (RUSTFLAGS breaks all caches, not meaningful) |

Findings:

- **shared-target-dir (V8) already delivers the main win** cross-worktree (~80% deps-cache hit between chained runs). Per-crate cold-clean lands at 4-5s, which is fine.
- **sccache is marginal** when shared-target-dir is active. sccache only helps with `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, which slows the edit loop. Trade-off: only worth it for fresh-target-dir cold starts (CI, branch swap).
- **lld on macOS not recommended**: Apple's ld64 is already optimized for Mach-O. The RUSTFLAGS swap forces a full deps recompile and breaks all caches.
- **mold on macOS: skip**. mold is Linux-focused; macOS support is not a reliable path.

**Real time sinks in the solo workflow** (not build):

1. **Cargo invocations x bullet count**: 8-12 cargo calls per bullet (test, clippy-lib, clippy-tests, fmt, coverage) x ~4s cargo overhead = ~40s of pure cargo overhead per bullet. At 8 bullets that is ~320s purely on cargo-resolve loops.
2. **Adversarial-gate latency**: ~30 minutes per solo run (GATE-2 subagent + codex CLI + GATE-3 verifier + code-reviewer + codex). Token-throughput bound.
3. **Subagent token throughput**: model bound.

**Possible workflow levers** (higher impact than build-tuning):

- Parallelize per-bullet gates (clippy + test in parallel instead of sequential). Achievable via separate background bash calls.
- nextest archive for CI reuse (`cargo nextest archive`).
- sccache only as opt-in env (`RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`) for cold-worktree starts, NOT default.
- Cut bullets by API surface rather than by crate: fewer round-2 fixes thanks to clean layer decisions upfront.

**Anti-pattern**: build bench without workflow bench. If cargo invocations x bullet count plus gate latency are not measured alongside, the wrong lever is being optimized.

## Cleanup (auto + manual)

The solo agent removes the worktree and the branch automatically in Phase 7 (Auto-Squash-Merge). The only manual step left is `tmux kill-window` after pattern-persist.

Before 0.20.0 cleanup was fully manual and order-sensitive (retro first, then cleanup). Since 0.20.0 the solo agent performs the squash, branch-delete, and worktree-remove itself, and the retro step is the only remaining human duty.

## Companion skills (bundled)

The plugin ships two companion skills, both plugin-namespaced:

- **`/tmux-pair:gepa`**: Genetic-Pareto prompt/text-artifact optimization (paper arXiv:2507.19457). Opt-in after rules-bootstrap to optimize the freshly generated `.claude/rules/*.md`. Skill files in `skills/gepa/`.
- **`/tmux-pair:dg`**: Dinesh-vs-Gilfoyle adversarial code review. Two AI personas (attacker + defender) debate a diff or file until the defender concedes, defends, or the round limit hits. Useful as an optional pre-GATE-3 step on security/concurrency/auth/crypto/migration bullets. Skill files in `skills/dg/`.

External companion (NOT bundled): `code-simplifier` from `claude-plugins-official` for refactor-passes after a feature lands.
