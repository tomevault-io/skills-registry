# MemoryLane Release Workflow

Use this skill for both normal releases and prereleases. The GitHub Actions release pipeline builds macOS and Windows artifacts after the tagged commit is pushed. Tags without a suffix publish regular releases. Tags with a semver suffix such as `-beta.1` publish GitHub prereleases.

## Prerequisites

- Working tree is clean (`git status` shows nothing to commit)
- On the `main` branch, up to date with origin
- Dependencies installed with `npm install`

## Steps

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Always run this first so all workspace packages are present before any release edits, checks, or git operations.

### 2. Determine the new version

Ask the user if not provided.

- Stable: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Prerelease: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-label.N`

The git tag format is always `v<version>`.

### 3. Review changes since the last tag

```bash
git log --oneline $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD
git diff --stat $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD
```

Summarize the key user-facing changes. This drives `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

### 4. Bump version in `package.json`

Update the `"version"` field to the new version.

### 5. Update `RELEASE_NOTES.md`

Follow the existing format in the file. Keep the wording brief and current.

- **Title**: `# MemoryLane vX.Y.Z`
- **What's Changed**: Summarize the commits into user-facing bullet points. Reference GitHub issues where applicable (for example `closes #4`).
- **Features**: Update the feature list if new capabilities were added.
- **Known Issues & Limitations**: Remove any issues that have been resolved. Add new ones if applicable.
- **Installation**: Keep the macOS and Windows install guidance aligned with the current release channel.
- **Full Changelog**: Update the tag reference in the URL.

### 6. Update `README.md` if needed

Check the "Coming Soon" and "Limitations" sections. If a released feature is listed there, move or remove it.

### 7. Format and lint

```bash
npm run format
npm run lint
```

### 8. Commit and tag

Stage only the files you changed:

```bash
git add package.json RELEASE_NOTES.md
# Add README.md only if it changed for this release.
git add README.md
git commit -m "release: vX.Y.Z"
git tag vX.Y.Z
```

Create the tag only after the commit succeeds. Do not run `git commit` and `git tag` in parallel.

If the version is a prerelease, keep the same commit format and tag shape:

```bash
git commit -m "release: vX.Y.Z-label.N"
git tag vX.Y.Z-label.N
```

After tagging, verify it points at the release commit:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse vX.Y.Z
```

For prereleases:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse vX.Y.Z-label.N
```

These SHAs must match before pushing.

### 9. Push the commit and tag


```bash
git push origin HEAD
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

For a prerelease version, push the prerelease tag instead:

```bash
git push origin HEAD
git push origin vX.Y.Z-label.N
```

Pushing the tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`. That workflow builds both platforms and creates the GitHub release automatically.


## Checklist

Before finishing, verify:

- [ ] `package.json` version matches the new tag
- [ ] `RELEASE_NOTES.md` title and changelog link reference the new version
- [ ] Resolved known issues are removed from release notes
- [ ] `README.md` "Coming Soon" doesn't list shipped features
- [ ] `npm install` has been run before release steps
- [ ] `npm run format` and `npm run lint` pass
- [ ] Commit message matches the version tag
- [ ] The correct `v<version>` tag is pushed to origin
