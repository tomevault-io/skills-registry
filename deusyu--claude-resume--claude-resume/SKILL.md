# Resume — One Source, Many Tailored Resumes

A complete resume management system: structured experience data → AI-tailored LaTeX → PDF.

```
experiences/  →  /cv generate  →  resume.tex  →  make en  →  output/Name-Title.pdf
   (素材)         (AI 定制化)          (LaTeX源)      (编译)        (输出)
```

## Subcommand Routing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine which workflow to run:

- `init [text]` → **Init Workflow**
- `generate [job title or JD file]` or `gen [...]` → **Generate Workflow**
- `add [description]` → **Add Experience Workflow**
- Empty or unrecognized → Show available subcommands and ask user what they want to do

---

## Prerequisites Check

Before any workflow, verify the environment:

1. Check if `resume.cls` exists in the current working directory. If not, copy from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/resume.cls`
2. Check if `Makefile` exists. If not, copy from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/Makefile`
3. Create directories if missing: `experiences/work/`, `jobs/`, `output/`, `.history/`
4. Check if `xelatex` is available: `which xelatex`. If not, warn the user: "XeLaTeX is required. Install with: brew install --cask mactex"

---

## Init Workflow (`/cv init [text]`)

Initialize the experience data library from scratch.

### Mode Detection

Based on `$ARGUMENTS` (after stripping "init"):

1. **User pasted large text** (resume, work history, LinkedIn export) → **Import Mode**
2. **Empty or short description** → **Q&A Mode**
3. **File path provided** (PDF/Markdown) → Read file, then **Import Mode**

### Import Mode

1. **Parse** the provided content, extracting: personal info, education, work history (company, period, department, role, projects, metrics), personal projects, skills, honors
2. **Confirm** with user — show structured result, ask about missing info or inaccurate metrics
3. **Generate files** into `experiences/`:
   - `profile.md` — personal info + education
   - `work/<company>.md` — one file per company
   - `projects.md` — personal projects
   - `skills.md` — skill inventory
   - `honors.md` — honors + quantified metrics

### Q&A Mode

Walk through one question at a time. **Never ask multiple questions at once.**

1. **Basic info** → name, email, phone, wechat (optional), blog/github (optional) → write `experiences/profile.md`
2. **Education** → school, degree, major, period, highlights → append to `experiences/profile.md`
3. **Work history** (loop) → company, department, role, period, projects, metrics, tech stack → write `experiences/work/<company>.md`. After each: "Any more work experience?" Continue or move on.
4. **Personal projects** → name, link, description, tech stack, highlights → write `experiences/projects.md`
5. **Skills** → auto-generate from collected tech stacks, show for confirmation → write `experiences/skills.md`
6. **Honors** → extract quantified metrics from work history + user additions → write `experiences/honors.md`

### File Format Reference

**profile.md:**
```markdown
---
name: Name / English Name
email: email@example.com
phone: "+86 xxx"
wechat: xxx
blog: https://...
github: https://...
---

## Education

### School · College | Degree (Period)
- Major, highlights
```

**work/\<company\>.md:**
```markdown
---
company: Company Name
company_en: English Name
url: https://...
location: City
period: YYYY/MM -- YYYY/MM
department: Department
role: Role
tags: [tag1, tag2, ...]
---

# Project Name
> Timeline | Role

## Background
...

## Key Work
...

## Metrics
...

## Tech Stack
...
```

Key principles:
- Keep raw details in experiences — trimming happens at generation time
- Tags should cover core tech and business domain keywords
- Metrics must include specific numbers
- One file per company, filename in lowercase English (e.g., `bytedance.md`)

---

## Generate Workflow (`/cv generate [target]`)

Generate a tailored resume for a specific job target.

### Step 1: Read All Materials

Read all files:
- `experiences/profile.md`
- All `.md` files under `experiences/work/`
- `experiences/projects.md`
- `experiences/skills.md`
- `experiences/honors.md`

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/resume-example.tex` to understand the LaTeX structure and available commands.

If the argument is a file path, also read that JD file.

### Step 2: Analyze Job Requirements

Based on JD or job title, determine:
1. **Core technical requirements** — what skills matter most
2. **Experience priority** — which work experiences are most relevant
3. **Framing angle** — how to present the same experience differently for this role
4. **Content selection** — include/omit personal projects section, which experiences to trim

### Step 3: Present the Plan

Before generating .tex, show the user:
1. Target positioning (one sentence)
2. Content selection (which experiences to include/omit)
3. Key differentiation (how this resume differs from a generic one)

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### Step 4: Generate LaTeX

Generate `resume.tex` following these rules:

1. **Use resume.cls commands strictly**:
   - `\name{}`, `\basicInfo{}`, `\email{}`, `\phone{}`, `\wechat{}`, `\homepage[]{}`
   - `\section{}`, `\datedsubsection{}{}`, `\role{}{}`, `\rolewithdate{}{}{}`
   - `itemize` with `[parsep=0.25ex]`

2. **Keep to 1 page** (critical for Chinese version):
   - 5-6 sections: positioning, education, work, (projects), skills, honors
   - 3-5 bullet points per project
   - Trim early internships to 1-2 lines each
   - If too long, cut early internships and low-relevance bullets first

3. **LaTeX header for Chinese**:
   ```latex
   \documentclass{resume}
   \usepackage{xeCJK}
   \setCJKmainfont{SourceHanSerifSC-Medium}
   \setCJKsansfont{SourceHanSerifSC-Medium}
   \setCJKmonofont{SourceHanSerifSC-Medium}
   ```
   For English version: remove the three xeCJK lines.

4. **Formatting**:
   - Use `\textbf{【keyword】}` to mark each bullet's keyword
   - Escape: `&` → `\&`, `%` → `\%`
   - Use `\href{url}{text}` for hyperlinks

### Step 5: Build

1. Backup current `resume.tex` to `.history/resume_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).tex`
2. Write generated content to `resume.tex`
3. Run `make en` to build PDF
4. Copy PDF to `output/` with job-specific name

### Step 6: English Version (if requested)

1. Remove xeCJK lines
2. Translate all content to English
3. Build PDF

---

## Add Experience Workflow (`/cv add [description]`)

Add or update experience data incrementally.

### Step 1: Classify Input

Determine what the user is adding:
- **New work experience** → create/update `experiences/work/*.md`
- **New personal project** → update `experiences/projects.md`
- **New skill** → update `experiences/skills.md`
- **New honor/certification** → update `experiences/honors.md`
- **Personal info change** → update `experiences/profile.md`

### Step 2: Read Existing File

Read the target file to understand current content and format.

### Step 3: Update

Apply updates following the file format conventions above. Keep raw details — don't trim prematurely.

### Step 4: Confirm

Show the diff to the user, confirm before writing.

### Step 5: Remind

After updating: "Experience updated. Run `/cv generate [target]` to regenerate your resume."
