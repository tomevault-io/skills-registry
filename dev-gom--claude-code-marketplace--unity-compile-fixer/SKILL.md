# Unity Compile Fixer

## Overview

This skill enables automatic detection and resolution of Unity C# compilation errors by leveraging VSCode's diagnostic system. It collects real-time errors from the OmniSharp C# language server, analyzes error patterns against a curated database of common Unity issues, and proposes context-aware solutions for user approval before applying fixes.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Unity projects report C# compilation errors in VSCode
- Need to diagnose the root cause of Unity compiler errors (CS* error codes)
- Want automated fix suggestions for common Unity scripting issues
- Working with Unity projects that have version control integration (Git, Unity Collaborate, Plastic SCM)
- Need to handle Unity .meta file conflicts

**Example user requests:**
- "Check Unity compilation errors and help me fix them"
- "My Unity project has compiler errors, can you diagnose and fix?"
- "Unity scripts are not compiling, what's wrong?"
- "Fix the C# errors in my Unity project"

## Workflow

Follow this workflow when the skill is invoked:

### 1. Detect Compilation Errors

Use the `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` tool to collect errors from VSCode:

```typescript
// Collect all project diagnostics
mcp__ide__getDiagnostics()

// Or target specific Unity script files
mcp__ide__getDiagnostics({ uri: "file:///path/to/PlayerController.cs" })
```

Filter the diagnostics to focus on Unity-relevant errors:
- **Severity**: Only process errors with `severity: "Error"` (ignore warnings)
- **Source**: Only process `source: "csharp"` (OmniSharp C# diagnostics)
- **Error Codes**: Focus on CS* compiler error codes (e.g., CS0246, CS0029, CS1061)

### 2. Analyze Error Patterns

For each detected error:

1. **Extract error information:**
   - File path and line number from `uri` and `range`
   - Error code from `message` (e.g., "CS0246")
   - Full error message text

2. **Match against error pattern database:**
   - Load `references/error-patterns.json`
   - Find the error code entry (e.g., CS0246)
   - Retrieve common causes and solutions

3. **Read affected file context:**
   - Use Read tool to load the file with errors
   - Examine surrounding code for context
   - Identify missing imports, incorrect types, or API misuse

### 3. Generate Solution Proposals

For each error, create a structured fix proposal:

```markdown
**Error**: CS0246 at PlayerController.cs:45
**Message**: The type or namespace name 'Rigidbody' could not be found

**Analysis**:
- Missing using directive for UnityEngine namespace
- Common Unity API usage pattern

**Proposed Solution**:
Add `using UnityEngine;` at the top of PlayerController.cs

**Changes Required**:
- File: Assets/Scripts/PlayerController.cs
- Action: Insert using directive at line 1
```

### 4. User Confirmation

Before applying any fixes:

1. **Present all proposed solutions** in a clear, structured format
2. **Use AskUserQuestion tool** to get user approval:
   - List each error and proposed fix
   - Allow user to approve all, select specific fixes, or cancel

3. **Wait for explicit confirmation** - do not apply fixes automatically

### 5. Apply Approved Fixes

For each approved fix:

1. **Use Edit tool** to modify the affected file
2. **Preserve code formatting** and existing structure
3. **Apply minimal changes** - only fix the specific error

Example:
```typescript
Edit({
  file_path: "Assets/Scripts/PlayerController.cs",
  old_string: "public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour",
  new_string: "using UnityEngine;\n\npublic class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour"
})
```

### 6. Verify Version Control Status

After applying fixes:

1. **Check for .meta file conflicts:**
   - Use Grep to search for Unity .meta files
   - Verify that script GUID hasn't changed
   - Check for merge conflict markers (<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>)

2. **Report VCS status:**
   - List modified files
   - Warn about any .meta file issues
   - Suggest git operations if needed

### 7. Re-validate Compilation

After fixes are applied:

1. **Re-run diagnostics** using `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics()`
2. **Compare error count** before and after
3. **Report results** to the user:
   - Number of errors fixed
   - Remaining errors (if any)
   - Success rate

## Error Pattern Database

The skill relies on `references/error-patterns.json` for error analysis. This database contains:

- **Error Code**: CS* compiler error code
- **Description**: Human-readable explanation
- **Common Causes**: Typical reasons this error occurs in Unity
- **Solutions**: Step-by-step fix instructions
- **Unity-Specific Notes**: Unity API considerations

To analyze an error, load the database and match the error code:

```typescript
Read({ file_path: "references/error-patterns.json" })
// Parse JSON and find errorCode entry
```

## Analysis Scripts

The skill includes Node.js scripts in `scripts/` for complex error analysis:

### scripts/analyze-diagnostics.js

Processes VSCode diagnostics JSON output and extracts Unity-relevant errors.

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/analyze-diagnostics.js <diagnostics-json-file>
```

**Output:**
- Filtered list of Unity C# compilation errors
- Error classification by type (missing imports, type errors, API issues)
- Severity and file location information

This script can be run independently or invoked from the SKILL.md workflow when detailed analysis is needed.

## Best Practices

When using this skill:

1. **Start with full project diagnostics** - use `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics()` without parameters to get complete error picture
2. **Prioritize errors by severity and dependency** - fix foundational errors (missing imports) before downstream errors
3. **Batch related fixes** - group errors from the same file for efficient editing
4. **Always verify VCS status** - Unity .meta files are critical for version control
5. **Re-validate after fixes** - ensure errors are actually resolved
