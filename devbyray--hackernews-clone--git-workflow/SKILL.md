# Git Workflow

This skill defines the git workflow using conventional commits and a simplified gitflow approach.

## Branch Strategy

### Branch Types

**main** - Production-ready code. All features and bugfixes merge here.

**feature/** - New features and enhancements
- Naming: `feature/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
- Created from: `main`
- Merges to: `main`

**bugfix/** - Bug fixes
- Naming: `bugfix/<short-description>` (e.g., `bugfix/login-error`)
- Created from: `main`
- Merges to: `main`

### Branch Workflow

1. **Start new work:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **During development:**
   - Commit frequently using conventional commit messages
   - Keep branches focused on a single feature or fix
   - Rebase on main regularly to stay current

3. **Before merging:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git rebase main
   ```

4. **Merge to main:**
   - Create pull request
   - After approval, merge to main
   - Delete feature/bugfix branch after merge

## Conventional Commits

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **build**: Build system or dependency changes
- **ci**: CI/CD configuration changes
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Scope

Optional. Indicates the area of the codebase affected (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `database`).

### Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add login functionality
fix(api): resolve null pointer exception in user endpoint
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(utils): simplify date formatting logic
test(auth): add unit tests for password validation
```

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `!` after the type/scope or add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

```bash
feat(api)!: change response format to JSON API spec

BREAKING CHANGE: The API now returns responses in JSON API format
instead of the previous custom format. Update client code accordingly.
```

## Git Commands Reference

### Creating Branches

```bash
# Feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-profile

# Bugfix branch
git checkout -b bugfix/navbar-overflow
```

### Committing Changes

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with conventional message
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT token validation"

# Amend last commit
git commit --amend
```

### Syncing with Main

```bash
# Update your branch with latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-branch
git rebase main

# If conflicts occur, resolve them then:
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

### Pushing Changes

```bash
# First push of new branch
git push -u origin feature/your-branch

# Subsequent pushes
git push

# After rebase (force push required)
git push --force-with-lease
```

## Best Practices

1. **Commit frequently** - Small, focused commits are easier to review and revert
2. **Write clear commit messages** - Follow conventional commits format consistently
3. **Keep branches short-lived** - Merge feature branches within a few days
4. **Rebase before merging** - Keep history clean by rebasing on main before creating PR
5. **Delete merged branches** - Clean up branches after they're merged to main
6. **Use `--force-with-lease`** - Safer than `--force` when pushing after rebase
7. **One feature per branch** - Don't mix unrelated changes in the same branch

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Clear title** - Use conventional commit format for PR title
2. **Description** - Explain what changed and why
3. **Link issues** - Reference related issues (e.g., "Closes #123")
4. **Small PRs** - Easier to review, faster to merge
5. **Review before merge** - At least one approval required
6. **Squash option** - Consider squashing commits if the branch has many small commits

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Creating new branches for features or bugfixes
- Making commits (to ensure proper conventional commit format)
- Preparing to merge code to main
- Managing git operations within this project
- Reviewing or creating pull requests
