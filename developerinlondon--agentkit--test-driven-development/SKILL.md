# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## The Cycle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every code change follows this exact sequence:

1. **RED** — Write a test that describes the desired behavior. Run it. It MUST fail.
2. **GREEN** — Write the MINIMAL code to make the test pass. Nothing more.
3. **REFACTOR** — Clean up while keeping tests green. Remove duplication, improve naming.

**No code without a test. No test without seeing it fail first.**

## When to Apply

TDD applies to ALL code changes:

- **New features**: Test the behavior before writing it
- **Bug fixes**: Write a test that reproduces the bug, THEN fix it
- **Refactoring**: Ensure tests cover the behavior before changing implementation
- **API endpoints**: Test request/response contract before implementing the handler
- **CLI commands**: Test arg parsing and output before wiring the command
- **Data models**: Test serialization/deserialization before defining structs

## Workflow Steps (Detailed)

### Step 1: Write the Test

- Write a test that describes WHAT the code should do, not HOW
- Use descriptive test names: `user_login_returns_token`, not `test1`
- Test one behavior per test function
- Include edge cases and error paths

### Step 2: Verify RED

- Run the test suite
- Confirm the new test FAILS
- Confirm it fails for the RIGHT REASON (missing function, wrong return value — not a syntax error)
- If the test passes immediately, it's not testing new behavior — rewrite it

### Step 3: Implement (Minimal)

- Write ONLY the code needed to make the failing test pass
- Do not add extra features, optimizations, or "while I'm here" changes
- Do not write code that isn't covered by a test

### Step 4: Verify GREEN

- Run the FULL test suite (not just the new test)
- ALL tests must pass — new AND existing
- If existing tests break, fix the implementation, not the tests

### Step 5: Refactor

- Clean up duplication, improve names, extract helpers
- Run tests after EVERY refactor step to ensure nothing breaks
- This is where you improve code quality — not during GREEN

## Anti-Patterns (BLOCKING violations)

- Writing implementation before tests
- Writing tests that pass immediately (never saw RED)
- Skipping the RED verification step ("I know it'll fail")
- Writing tests after the fact to "backfill coverage"
- Deleting or modifying tests to make them pass instead of fixing code
- Writing too much implementation at once (should be incremental)
- Testing implementation details instead of behavior
- Skipping the refactor step

## Test Quality Standards

- Each test should be independent — no shared mutable state between tests
- Tests should be fast — mock external dependencies (network, filesystem, databases)
- Test names should read like specifications
- Prefer `assert_eq!` over `assert!` for better failure messages
- Test error paths, not just happy paths
- One logical assertion per test (multiple `assert_eq!` on the same result is fine)

## Bug Fix Protocol

When fixing a bug:

1. Write a test that REPRODUCES the bug (fails with current code)
2. Verify the test fails — this proves you understand the bug
3. Fix the bug with minimal changes
4. Verify the test passes — this proves the fix works
5. The test now permanently guards against regression
