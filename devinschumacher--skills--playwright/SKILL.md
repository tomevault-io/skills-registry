description: Canonical Playwright hub for E2E tests and ad-hoc browser automation. Use when the user explicitly mentions "Playwright", "@playwright/test", "npx playwright", "playwright.config.ts", "PWDEBUG", "trace viewer", or "toHaveScreenshot". Avoid using for generic browser automation unless Playwright is requested, and avoid using for pure web scraping. Use when this capability is needed.

# Playwright

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:

### Mentions / keywords

- Mentions “Playwright”, “@playwright/test”, “playwright.config.ts”, “trace viewer”, or “PWDEBUG”
- References `*.spec.ts` / `*.test.ts` files that import `@playwright/test`

### Context

- Is trying to add or maintain E2E/smoke coverage for a web app
- Is trying to debug flaky UI tests (selectors, timing, waits)
- Needs one-off automation (screenshots, console logs, quick flow checks)

## Purpose

- Route Playwright work into the right workflow (suite vs. one-off script vs. debugging)
- Standardize patterns that prevent flaky tests (locators, assertions, waits)
- Keep artifacts in `./tmp/` for predictable cleanup

## Quick routing

- **Writing/maintaining `@playwright/test` suites** → See `references/e2e-with-playwright-test.md`
- **Auth once, reuse state (`storageState`)** → See `references/auth-and-storage-state.md`
- **CI hardening + config knobs** → See `references/ci-and-config.md`
- **Locators, assertions, POM, fixtures** → See `references/patterns.md`
- **Fixtures (worker-scoped, auto fixtures)** → See `references/fixtures.md`
- **Mocking APIs / controlling network** → See `references/api-mocking.md`
- **Visual testing (`toHaveScreenshot`)** → See `references/visual-testing.md`
- **Link checking / dead link detection** → See `references/link-checking.md`
- **Flaky tests / trace viewer / retries** → See `references/debugging.md`
- **One-off automation (screenshots/logs/check flows)** → See `references/ad-hoc-automation.md`

## Non-negotiables

- Prefer `getByRole` / `getByLabel` over CSS/XPath; add `data-testid` only when needed.
- Use web-first assertions (`await expect(locator).toBeVisible()`) instead of boolean checks.
- Never add `waitForTimeout()` to “fix” flake; if you use it temporarily while debugging, remove it before calling the work “done”.
- Don’t default to `networkidle` everywhere; use it intentionally (SPAs / known background activity can make it misleading).
- For CLI agent runs, use minimal reporters to avoid log spam; store artifacts under `./tmp/playwright/`.
- Keep tests independent; avoid cross-test shared state.

## Verification

- E2E suite changes: run `npx playwright test --reporter=line` (or `--reporter=dot`) and confirm failures reproduce.
- Flake fixes: run the previously failing test at least 5 times (ex: `--repeat-each 5`) before calling it fixed.
- CI-sensitive changes: run the suite in “CI-like” settings (ex: `CI=1 npx playwright test --reporter=line`) and confirm it still behaves.

## Provenance

- Consolidated from upstream installed skills: `playwright-best-practices`, `playwright-testing`, `playwright-expert`, `playwright-skill`, `webapp-testing`
