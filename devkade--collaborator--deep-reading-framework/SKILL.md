# Deep Reading Framework

A systematic approach to deep document analysis based on the three-pass reading methodology. This skill guides critical analysis with emphasis on Third Pass: assumption validation, context dependencies, and actionable reconstruction.

## Overview

This skill provides structured guidance for Third Pass critical analysis of documents. Users complete First and Second Pass independently (reading, understanding, note-taking), then use this skill for deep critical analysis that challenges assumptions, identifies context dependencies, and extracts actionable insights.

## Quick Start

**Typical workflow:**

1. User reads document and completes First/Second Pass independently
2. User triggers skill: "Third Pass 시작" or "이 글 비판적으로 분석해줘"
3. Skill detects document type automatically
4. Guides systematic critical analysis
5. Outputs structured analysis compatible with user's template

## Document Type Detection

Automatically detect and adapt analysis to document type based on content, structure, vocabulary, and writing style.

**Supported types:**
- **tech-blog**: Technical articles, tutorials, engineering posts (problem-solution structure, code examples)
- **retrospective**: Project retrospectives, experience sharing, lessons learned (temporal narrative, reflective tone)
- **technical-doc**: API documentation, architecture docs, specifications (reference structure, technical precision)
- **personal-writing**: User's own drafts, essays, thought pieces (exploratory tone, argument structure)
- **academic-paper**: Research papers, scholarly articles (abstract, methods, citations)

**Detection approach:**
1. Analyze content markers (abstract, code blocks, section headings)
2. Identify vocabulary patterns (academic vs conversational, technical depth)
3. Assess structure (sequential vs reference vs argumentative)
4. If ambiguous, ask: "이 문서는 [TYPE1] 또는 [TYPE2] 중 어느 것에 가까운가요?"

## Third Pass Workflow

Follow these steps systematically:

### Step 1: Document Type Confirmation

State the detected type and confirm with user:
"이 문서를 [TYPE]로 판단했습니다. Third Pass 비판적 분석을 시작할까요?"

### Step 2: Critical Analysis

Challenge core claims and validate reasoning.

**Universal questions (all types):**
- What are the central claims or messages?
- What evidence or reasoning supports them?
- What are potential weaknesses or limitations?
- What counterexamples or failure cases exist?
- Is this generalizable or context-specific?

**Load type-specific questions:** Read `references/critical-questions.md` for detailed questions per document type.

Output format:
```markdown
#### Critical Analysis
- **주장의 약점 / 적용 한계**
  - [Specific issues with claims, evidence, or reasoning]
  - [Scenarios where this approach fails]
  - [Generalization limits]
```

### Step 3: Context Dependencies

Identify implicit assumptions that constrain validity.

**Key dimensions:**
- **Technical environment**: Stack, tools, scale, constraints
- **Prerequisites**: Assumed knowledge or experience level
- **Temporal context**: When written, evolving technologies
- **Cultural/organizational**: Team structure, company culture, regional factors

Output format:
```markdown
- **컨텍스트 의존성 (환경, 스택, 시기)**
  - Environment: [Tech stack, scale, constraints that this assumes]
  - Prerequisites: [What reader needs to know/have]
  - Temporal: [Time-dependent assumptions]
  - Cultural: [Organizational or regional assumptions]
```

### Step 4: Missing Perspectives

Find gaps, alternatives, and unexplored angles.

**Look for:**
- Alternative approaches not mentioned
- Trade-offs or costs not discussed
- Contrary viewpoints or debates
- Edge cases or exceptions
- Relevant references or prior work not cited

Output format:
```markdown
- **누락된 관점 / 대안**
  - Alternatives: [Other approaches not considered]
  - Trade-offs: [Costs or sacrifices not discussed]
  - Contrary views: [Opposing perspectives]
  - Edge cases: [Scenarios not addressed]
```

### Step 5: Reconstruction

Demonstrate deep understanding by restating core ideas without reference to source.

**Tasks:**
- Summarize key concepts in own words
- Explain the approach as if teaching someone
- Identify what applies to your context
- Consider how you would approach differently

Output format:
```markdown
#### Reconstruction
- **핵심을 나만의 언어로**
  - [Restate the central thesis and key supporting ideas without looking at source]

- **내 상황에 적용한다면**
  - 직접 적용: [What can be adopted as-is]
  - 변형 필요: [What needs modification and how]
  - 적용 불가: [What doesn't fit my situation and why]
```

### Step 6: Actionable Insights

Extract practical value and next steps.

**Focus on:**
- Immediate takeaways
- Limitations to remember
- Follow-up questions or experiments
- Related areas to explore
- Actions to take

Output format:
```markdown
#### Discussion
- **가져갈 것**
  - [Most valuable insights - what to remember and apply]

- **한계**
  - [Boundaries of applicability, remaining uncertainties]

#### Action Items
- [ ] [Specific action item or research question]
- [ ] [Related concept to explore]

#### Future Ideas
- [ ] [Experiment to validate understanding]
```

## Interactive Guidance

Guide user through analysis with checkpoints:

**After type detection:**
"[TYPE]로 분석을 시작합니다. 이 유형에 맞는 비판적 질문을 적용하겠습니다."

**After each major step:**
"[STEP] 완료했습니다. 다음 단계([NEXT_STEP])로 진행할까요, 아니면 이 부분을 더 깊이 탐구할까요?"

**When user seems uncertain:**
"특정 섹션이나 주장에 대해 더 자세히 분석하고 싶으신 부분이 있나요?"

## On-Demand Support

Provide targeted assistance beyond Third Pass:

**Second Pass support:**
- "이 그림/표가 정확히 무엇을 의미하는지 도와줘"
- "핵심 주장과 증거를 정리해줘"

**Contextual research:**
- "관련 논문/글 찾아줘"
- "이 접근법을 사용한 다른 사례는?"

**Concept clarification:**
- "이 용어/개념이 정확히 무엇을 의미하는지 설명해줘"
- "이 가정이 타당한지 검증해줘"

**Comparison:**
- "이 글과 [[다른글]] 비교 분석해줘"
- "이 두 접근법의 차이는 무엇인가?"

## Best Practices

**For optimal results:**

1. **Complete First/Second Pass independently** - Have basic understanding before critical analysis
2. **Provide context** - Share your background, goals, or specific concerns
3. **Be specific** - Point to particular sections or claims for focused analysis
4. **Iterate** - Refine sections that need deeper exploration
5. **Connect to practice** - Always consider real-world applicability

**When to use this skill:**

✅ After reading complex technical content
✅ When evaluating whether to adopt an approach
✅ Before citing or building upon an article
✅ When reviewing your own writing for gaps
✅ During literature review or research

**When NOT to use:**

❌ For quick skimming or surface reading
❌ When basic comprehension is sufficient
❌ For simple reference lookups

## Progressive Disclosure

For complex analysis needs:

1. **Start with SKILL.md** - Core workflow and guidance
2. **Load references as needed**:
   - `references/critical-questions.md` - Type-specific analytical questions
   - `references/reconstruction-guide.md` - Detailed reconstruction techniques
   - `references/common-patterns.md` - Frequently encountered patterns and pitfalls
3. **Use assets for output** - Standard templates for consistent formatting

## Notes on Output

- Match user's existing template structure when provided
- Use bullet points with bold headings for clear structure
- Keep analysis concise but thorough
- Focus on actionable insights over abstract critique
- Prioritize practical applicability
