# Midnight Development Network (Devnet)

The devnet is a local 3-service blockchain network for Midnight development. It runs via Docker Compose and is managed through the `/midnight-tooling:devnet` command, which uses bash and Docker Compose commands directly.

## Terminology -- Read This First

> **Four distinct components make up the local development environment. Always be precise about which is being referenced.**

| Term | What It Is | Port | Container |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|
| **Devnet** | The complete local 3-service network managed as a unit | N/A (all three below) | Managed via Docker Compose |
| **Node** | The Midnight blockchain node (Substrate-based) | 9944 | `midnight-node` |
| **Indexer** | GraphQL API for querying chain state and subscribing to events | 8088 | `midnight-indexer` |
| **Proof server** | Generates zero-knowledge proofs for transactions | 6300 | `midnight-proof-server` |

The devnet is **not** a single service. It is the coordinated set of all three services. Starting the devnet starts all three; stopping it stops all three.

## Prerequisites

Docker Desktop must be installed and running before the devnet can start. The three services together require adequate system resources.

| Check | Command | Expected |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Docker installed | `docker --version` | Version string |
| Docker daemon running | `docker info` | System info (no connection errors) |
| Docker Compose available | `docker compose version` | Version string |
| Adequate resources | Docker Desktop settings | 4 GB+ RAM allocated to Docker |

If Docker is not installed, see `references/docker-setup.md` for platform-specific installation instructions.

## Quick Command Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/midnight-tooling:devnet generate` | Create a `devnet.yml` from template with latest stable versions |
| `/midnight-tooling:devnet update` | Update image versions in an existing `devnet.yml` |
| `/midnight-tooling:devnet start` | Start all 3 services (generates compose file on first run) |
| `/midnight-tooling:devnet stop` | Stop all containers |
| `/midnight-tooling:devnet restart` | Stop and restart the network |
| `/midnight-tooling:devnet status` | Check Docker container state for all services (fast) |
| `/midnight-tooling:devnet health` | Hit HTTP endpoints on each service to verify responsiveness (thorough, with timing) |
| `/midnight-tooling:devnet logs` | View recent logs from the network services |
| `/midnight-tooling:devnet config` | Show endpoint URLs, network ID, image versions, and file info |

## Services

| Service | Port | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---------|------|----------|---------|
| **Node** | 9944 | `http://127.0.0.1:9944` | Blockchain RPC (Substrate JSON-RPC) |
| **Indexer** | 8088 | `http://127.0.0.1:8088/api/v4/graphql` | GraphQL queries and subscriptions |
| **Proof server** | 6300 | `http://127.0.0.1:6300` | Zero-knowledge proof generation |

The indexer also exposes a WebSocket endpoint at `ws://127.0.0.1:8088/api/v4/graphql/ws` for real-time subscriptions.

The network ID for local devnet is `undeployed`.

## Scripts

The skill includes four helper scripts in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/`:

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `resolve-versions.sh` | Query Docker Hub for latest stable image versions | Returns `key=value` pairs |
| `generate-devnet.sh` | Create `devnet.yml` from template with version substitution | `--template <path> --node-version X --indexer-version X --proof-server-version X [--directory <path>]` |
| `check-staleness.sh` | Check age of a `devnet.yml` file | Returns `age_days=N` and `stale=true/false` |
| `find-devnet.sh` | Locate a `devnet.yml` in standard locations | `[--file <path>]` |

The compose file template is at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/devnet.yml`.

## Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `docker: command not found` | Docker not installed | Install Docker Desktop — see `references/docker-setup.md` |
| `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon` | Docker Desktop not running | Start Docker Desktop and wait for it to be ready |
| `docker compose: command not found` | Older Docker without Compose V2 | Update Docker Desktop or install docker-compose-plugin |
| Services fail to start or exit immediately | Insufficient Docker resources | Allocate at least 4 GB RAM to Docker Desktop (see `references/docker-setup.md`) |
| Port 9944, 8088, or 6300 already in use | Another process occupying a required port | Stop the conflicting process; use `lsof -i :<port>` to identify it |
| Network starts but indexer not responding | Indexer still syncing with node | Wait 10-20 seconds after start; use `/midnight-tooling:devnet health` to check readiness |
| Stale chain state causing errors | Corrupted or outdated volumes | Restart with `--remove-volumes` for a clean slate |
| Container name conflicts | Previous containers not cleaned up | Stop the devnet first (`/midnight-tooling:devnet stop`), then start again |
| `Failed to fetch tags` from Docker Hub | Docker Hub unreachable or rate-limited | Check internet connection; use `--node-version` etc. to specify versions manually |
| Architecture mismatch on Apple Silicon | Image not available for arm64 | See Apple Silicon note in `references/docker-setup.md` |
| Compose file stale warning | File older than 5 days | Run `/midnight-tooling:devnet update` to refresh image versions |

## Wallet Operations

For wallet management, funding, balance checking, transfers, and dust registration, use the `midnight-wallet` plugin. The wallet plugin's MCP tools work with any running devnet — it auto-detects the services by Docker image name.

## Status & Health Probes

For status and health checks from inside a script, the statusline, or a doctor agent, use the `midnight-tooling:devnet-health` skill. It provides two bash scripts (`status.sh`, `health.sh`) that report container state and per-service HTTP health using only `bash`, `docker`, and `curl`.
