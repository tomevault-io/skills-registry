# Midnight Proof Server

The Midnight proof server generates zero-knowledge proofs for Midnight transactions. It can run locally as a Docker container or be accessed as a remote service on testnet/mainnet. The server exposes an HTTP API (default port 6300) that DApps use to request proof generation at runtime.

## Local Development

For local development, use the devnet which manages a proof server alongside a node and indexer. Run `/midnight-tooling:devnet start` to start the full local network. See the `devnet` skill for details.

The rest of this skill covers working with proof servers directly — useful when connecting to testnet/mainnet or running a standalone instance.

## Looking Up Environment Endpoints

Current proof server addresses for testnet and mainnet are published in the Midnight documentation. To look up the latest endpoints:

Use the `octocode` MCP to fetch the `relnotes/overview` page from the `midnightntwrk/midnight-docs` repository:

```
githubGetFileContent(
  owner: "midnightntwrk",
  repo: "midnight-docs",
  path: "docs/relnotes/overview.mdx",
  fullContent: true
)
```

This page contains the current network environment details including proof server URLs, node endpoints, and indexer endpoints for all active environments.

## Terminology

| Term | What It Is | How It Runs |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Proof server** | A service that generates zero-knowledge proofs for Midnight transactions | Docker container (`midnightntwrk/proof-server`) listening on port 6300 |
| **Docker Desktop** | The container runtime required to run the proof server | System application, must be running before starting the proof server |

The proof server is **not** the same as the Compact compiler. The compiler produces ZK circuits from Compact source code; the proof server uses those circuits to generate proofs at runtime. See the **compact-cli** skill for compiler installation, compilation commands, and output file details.

## Prerequisites

Docker Desktop must be installed and running before the proof server can start.

| Check | Command | Expected |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Docker installed | `docker --version` | Version string |
| Docker daemon running | `docker info` | System info (no connection errors) |

If Docker is not installed, download it from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

If Docker is installed but not running, start Docker Desktop and wait for it to be ready before proceeding.

## Image Version & Tag Selection

The proof server image is published to Docker Hub as `midnightntwrk/proof-server` with semver-based tags.

### Available Tag Types

| Tag Pattern | Example | Type |
|-------------|---------|------|
| `X.Y.Z` | `7.0.2` | Stable release |
| `X.Y.Z-rc.N` | `8.0.0-rc.4` | Release candidate (prerelease) |
| `X.Y.Z-<suffix>` | `8.0.0-performance.1` | Other prerelease |
| `X.Y.Z-arm64` / `X.Y.Z-amd64` | `7.0.2-arm64` | Architecture-specific (ignore — Docker selects automatically) |
| `latest` | `latest` | Points to the most recent push (may be a prerelease) |

### Listing Available Versions

Fetch available tags from the Docker Hub registry API:

```bash
curl -s "https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/midnightntwrk/proof-server/tags/?page_size=100&ordering=last_updated" \
  | grep -o '"name": *"[^"]*"' \
  | sed 's/"name": *"//;s/"$//'
```

### Resolving the Latest Stable Version

Filter to tags matching strict semver (`X.Y.Z` only — no prerelease suffixes, no architecture suffixes), sort numerically, and select the highest:

```bash
curl -s "https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/midnightntwrk/proof-server/tags/?page_size=100&ordering=last_updated" \
  | grep -o '"name": *"[^"]*"' \
  | sed 's/"name": *"//;s/"$//' \
  | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' \
  | sort -t. -k1,1n -k2,2n -k3,3n \
  | tail -1
```

The `grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$'` pattern excludes:
- Prerelease tags (`8.0.0-rc.4`, `8.0.0-performance.1`)
- Architecture-specific tags (`7.0.2-arm64`, `7.0.2-amd64`)
- Non-semver tags (`latest`)

### Version Selection Defaults

| Scenario | Tag Used |
|----------|----------|
| User specifies `--version 8.0.0-rc.4` | `8.0.0-rc.4` (exact) |
| User specifies `--version latest` | `latest` |
| No version specified | Latest stable (`X.Y.Z` without prerelease suffix) |
| No stable versions found | Fall back to `latest` with a warning |
| Docker Hub API unreachable | Fall back to `latest` with a warning |

## Running the Proof Server

The proof server is memory-intensive. Ensure Docker has at least 4 GB RAM allocated. See `references/docker-setup.md` for resource configuration.

Start the proof server in detached mode so it runs in the background (replace `<tag>` with the resolved version):

```bash
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6300:6300 midnightntwrk/proof-server:<tag> -- midnight-proof-server -v
```

For example, with version 8.0.3:

```bash
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6300:6300 midnightntwrk/proof-server:8.0.3 -- midnight-proof-server -v
```

| Flag / Argument | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-d` | Run in detached (background) mode |
| `--name midnight-proof-server` | Assign a predictable container name for management |
| `-p 6300:6300` | Map host port 6300 to container port 6300 |
| `--` | Separates Docker options from the container command |
| `midnight-proof-server` | The binary to run inside the container |
| `-v` | Enable verbose logging inside the proof server |

### Verifying the Server

After starting, verify the server is healthy:

```bash
# Check container is running
docker ps --filter "name=midnight-proof-server" --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"

# Health check — returns {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
curl -sf http://localhost:6300/health

# Check server version
curl -sf http://localhost:6300/version

# Readiness check — returns {"status":"ok","jobsProcessing":N,"jobsPending":N,"jobCapacity":N,...}
curl -sf http://localhost:6300/ready

# View recent logs
docker logs --tail 20 midnight-proof-server
```

The server is ready when `/health` returns `{"status":"ok",...}` and `/ready` returns status `"ok"` with HTTP 200. If `/ready` returns HTTP 503 with status `"busy"`, the server is running but its job queue is full.

For a one-shot probe of the proof server (and the rest of the devnet) from inside a script, use the `midnight-tooling:devnet-health` skill — its `health.sh` calls `/version` on the proof server with a 5 s timeout.

## Stopping the Proof Server

```bash
docker stop midnight-proof-server
```

To remove the stopped container (required before starting a new one with the same name):

```bash
docker rm midnight-proof-server
```

## Restarting / Replacing the Proof Server

If a container named `midnight-proof-server` already exists (running or stopped), remove it before starting a new one:

```bash
docker rm -f midnight-proof-server 2>/dev/null
docker run -d --name midnight-proof-server -p 6300:6300 midnightntwrk/proof-server:<tag> -- midnight-proof-server -v
```

## Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `docker: command not found` | Docker not installed | Install Docker Desktop |
| `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon` | Docker Desktop not running | Start Docker Desktop, wait for it to be ready |
| `port is already allocated` on 6300 | Another process using port 6300 | Stop the conflicting process or use a different port mapping (e.g., `-p 6301:6300`) |
| `Conflict. The container name "/midnight-proof-server" is already in use` | Stopped container with same name exists | Run `docker rm midnight-proof-server` then retry |
| Container starts but exits immediately | Image issue or resource constraints | Check logs with `docker logs midnight-proof-server` |
| `curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 6300` | Server not ready or not running | Wait a few seconds for startup; check `docker ps` for container status |

## API Endpoints

The proof server exposes the following HTTP endpoints on port 6300:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Response |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| `/` | GET | Health check (alias for `/health`) | `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}` |
| `/health` | GET | Health check | `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}` |
| `/version` | GET | Server version | Plain text, e.g. `8.0.0-rc.4` |
| `/ready` | GET | Readiness and worker pool utilization | `{"status":"ok","jobsProcessing":N,"jobsPending":N,"jobCapacity":N,"timestamp":"..."}` |
| `/proof-versions` | GET | Supported proof versions | Plain text, e.g. `["V2"]` |

The `/ready` endpoint returns HTTP 200 when ready and HTTP 503 when the job queue is full (status `"busy"`).
