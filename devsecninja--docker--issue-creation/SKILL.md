# Issue Creation Skill

## Purpose

This skill creates comprehensive, developer-ready GitHub issues following **Scrum methodology**. Every issue must be complete enough for a developer or AI agent to pick up and implement without needing additional clarification.

## Issue Types

### Feature (User Story)

Use the **User Story** format for new functionality or enhancements.

### Bug

Use the **Bug Report** format for defects, regressions, or unexpected behavior.

---

## Mandatory Issue Sections

Every issue **must** contain all of the following sections. Do not skip any.

### 1. Title

- Prefix with issue type: `[Feature]` or `[Bug]`
- Be specific and action-oriented
- Include the affected component or role name
- Examples:
  - `[Feature] Add Prometheus monitoring Docker Compose module`
  - `[Bug] ansible-pull timer fails to restart after config change`

### 2. Description

Provide a detailed **functional description** of the work.

**For Features** — use the User Story format:

```markdown
## Description

**As a** [role/persona],
**I want** [capability/action],
**So that** [business value/outcome].

### Functional Details

[Detailed explanation of what needs to be built, how it should work, and how it
integrates with the existing system. Reference specific files, roles, playbooks,
or modules where applicable.]
```

**For Bugs** — use the Bug Report format and include a **Severity Classification**:

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Active vulnerability, data exposure, or complete security control failure. Blocks deployment. |
| **High** | Significant weakening of security posture or missing defense-in-depth layer. Must fix before next release. |
| **Medium** | Reduces security margin or deviates from hardening best practices. Address soon. |
| **Low** | Minor hardening improvement or defense-in-depth enhancement. Address when convenient. |
| **Info** | Observation or suggestion. No immediate action required. |

```markdown
## Description

**Severity**: [Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info]

### Summary
[Clear, concise description of the defect.]

### Steps to Reproduce
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### Expected Behavior
[What should happen.]

### Actual Behavior
[What happens instead.]

### Environment
- **Host**: [e.g., svlazext, svldev]
- **OS**: [e.g., Ubuntu 24.04]
- **Ansible version**: [e.g., 2.20+]
- **Related roles/modules**: [e.g., docker_compose_modules, maintenance]
```

### 3. Scope

Define clear boundaries of the work. List what is **in scope** and what is **out of scope**.

```markdown
## Scope

### In Scope
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 1]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 2]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 3]

### Out of Scope
- [Item explicitly excluded and why]
- [Item deferred to a future issue]
```

### 4. Acceptance Criteria

Provide **measurable, testable** criteria using the Given/When/Then format. All criteria must be met for the issue to be considered **Done**.

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Given** [precondition], **When** [action], **Then** [expected result]
- [ ] **Given** [precondition], **When** [action], **Then** [expected result]
- [ ] All existing tests pass (`task test`)
- [ ] No new yamllint errors (`task lint:yaml`)
- [ ] No new ansible-lint errors (`task lint:ansible`)
- [ ] Playbook syntax check passes (`task syntax`)
- [ ] Change is backward-compatible with existing servers running `ansible-pull` from `main`, or a migration path is documented
- [ ] Security Assessment section is completed (see Section 8)
```

### 5. Testing Requirements

Specify exactly what tests must be written or updated, and how to validate the work.

```markdown
## Testing Requirements

### New Tests
- [ ] [Describe new test case 1 — file location and what it validates]
- [ ] [Describe new test case 2 — file location and what it validates]

### Existing Tests
- [ ] All Bats tests pass: `task test` or `./tests/bash/run-tests.sh`
- [ ] Linting passes: `task lint`
- [ ] Syntax checks pass: `task syntax`
- [ ] CI pipeline passes on the PR branch

### Manual Validation
- [ ] [Describe any manual validation steps if applicable]
```

### 6. Business Justification (Necessity)

Explain **why** this work matters. State the business outcome expected.

```markdown
## Business Justification

### Problem
[What problem does this solve? What is the current pain point or gap?]

### Expected Outcome
[What measurable improvement or capability will this deliver?]

### Impact of Inaction
[What happens if this is not done? Risk, technical debt, user impact, etc.]

### Priority Rationale
[Why this priority level? What depends on this?]
```

### 7. Implementation Notes (Optional but Recommended)

Provide guidance to help the developer or AI agent get started quickly.

```markdown
## Implementation Notes

### Affected Files
- `ansible/roles/<role>/tasks/main.yml`
- `ansible/inventory/host_vars/<host>.yml`
- `tests/bash/<test>.bats`

### Approach
[Suggested implementation approach, patterns to follow, or relevant examples
in the codebase to reference.]

### Dependencies
- [External dependency, Ansible collection, or prerequisite issue]

### Risks
- [Known risks or areas requiring caution]
```

### 8. Security Assessment (Mandatory)

Every issue must include a security assessment. This is a **public repository** — every committed byte is visible to adversaries. Security analysis is not optional.

#### Security Impact Assessment

State whether the change affects the attack surface. If any of the following are true, the issue is **security-relevant** and requires the full security assessment below:

- Introduces a new Docker container or Compose module
- Exposes a new port or changes network configuration
- Modifies SSH key management or user access
- Changes the ansible-pull trust chain (scripts, timers, repo URL)
- Adds a new external dependency (image, collection, role, package)
- Changes secret handling (SOPS config, `.env` templates, vault)

If none of the above apply, state: *"No security impact — this change does not alter the attack surface."*

#### Full Security Assessment (for security-relevant issues)

```markdown
## Security Assessment

### Security Impact
[Does this change alter the attack surface? What is introduced, exposed, or modified?]

### STRIDE Threat Context
[Which STRIDE categories apply? Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information
Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege. State the category and
the specific threat scenario.]

### Blast Radius
[How many servers/services are affected if this change has a defect?
A single module? All hosts? The entire ansible-pull pipeline?]

### Backward Compatibility
[Will this change break existing servers running ansible-pull from the main
branch? If yes, describe the migration path. If no, state why.]

### Rollback Strategy
[How can this change be reverted if it causes issues in production?
Describe the rollback steps.]

### Supply Chain Consideration
[If a new external dependency is introduced: Is it from a verified publisher?
Is it pinned by version and SHA digest? If no new dependency, state N/A.]

### Security Checklist
- [ ] No plaintext secrets introduced
- [ ] New containers use `security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]`
- [ ] New containers specify a non-root user where the image supports it
- [ ] New containers drop all capabilities and add back only what is needed
- [ ] No unnecessary host ports exposed
- [ ] Docker networks are properly isolated (frontend/backend separation)
- [ ] Image references include SHA digest
- [ ] UFW rules are minimal and documented
- [ ] `.env` files are mode `0600` and owned by root
- [ ] SOPS encryption covers all sensitive variables
```

## Labels

Apply the appropriate labels to every issue:

| Label | Usage |
|---|---|
| `type: feature` | New functionality or enhancement |
| `type: bug` | Defect or regression |
| `priority: critical` | Blocks production or other work |
| `priority: high` | Should be in the current sprint |
| `priority: medium` | Should be in the next sprint |
| `priority: low` | Backlog, nice-to-have |
| `role: <name>` | Affected Ansible role (e.g., `role: docker_compose_modules`) |
| `area: ci` | CI/CD pipeline related |
| `area: testing` | Test suite related |
| `area: docs` | Documentation related |
| `area: security` | Security-relevant change |
| `severity: critical` | Active vulnerability or control failure (bugs only) |
| `severity: high` | Significant security posture weakening (bugs only) |
| `severity: medium` | Deviates from hardening best practices (bugs only) |
| `severity: low` | Minor hardening improvement (bugs only) |

---

## Scrum Estimation

Include a **Story Point estimate** using the Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13). Add this at the bottom of the issue.

```markdown
## Estimation

**Story Points**: [1/2/3/5/8/13]

| Points | Guideline |
|---|---|
| 1 | Trivial change, single file, no tests needed |
| 2 | Small change, 1-2 files, minor test updates |
| 3 | Moderate change, new task file or template, test additions |
| 5 | New role or module, multiple files, new test suite |
| 8 | Complex feature spanning multiple roles, significant testing |
| 13 | Large architectural change, should consider splitting |

> If estimated at 13 or above, split the issue into smaller issues.
```

---

## Definition of Done

Every issue must meet **all** of these criteria before it can be closed:

1. All **Acceptance Criteria** are met
2. All **Testing Requirements** are satisfied
3. Code follows the repository's [conventions](../../copilot-instructions.md):
   - 2-space YAML indentation
   - `ansible.builtin.*` FQCNs used
   - `snake_case` for variables, `UPPERCASE` for hosts
   - `---` document start markers
   - Lowercase booleans (`true`/`false`)
4. `task lint` passes with zero errors
5. `task syntax` passes
6. `task test` passes (all Bats tests)
7. CI pipeline passes on the PR branch
8. PR reviewed and approved (if applicable)
9. Changes are backward-compatible with existing servers (or migration path documented)
10. No secrets or credentials committed
11. Security Assessment completed — attack surface impact stated, STRIDE analysis done if security-relevant
12. New external dependencies are pinned by version and SHA digest

## Rules for the Agent

1. **Never create a vague issue.** Every section must have concrete, specific content — no TODOs or "TBD" placeholders in the final issue.
2. **Always include all mandatory sections.** Omitting a section makes the issue incomplete and unactionable.
3. **Reference real files and paths** from this repository when listing affected files or implementation notes.
4. **Keep issues scoped.** A single issue should represent a single deployable unit of work. If the scope grows beyond 8 story points, split into multiple issues.
5. **Use the correct template** — Feature for new work, Bug for defects.
6. **Include testing commands** — always reference `task test`, `task lint`, and `task syntax` in testing requirements.
7. **Validate against the Definition of Done** before considering the issue ready.
8. **Write for the implementer** — assume the person (or agent) picking up the issue has access to the repo but no prior context about this specific change.
9. **Always complete the Security Assessment section.** If the change is not security-relevant, explicitly state "No security impact." Never leave it blank.
10. **Classify bug severity** — every bug must carry a severity label (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info) in both the description and the issue labels.
11. **State backward compatibility** — every issue must confirm the change won't break servers pulling from `main`, or document the migration path.
12. **Include rollback strategy** for non-trivial changes — describe how the change can be reverted.
13. **Flag new external dependencies** — if the issue introduces a new Docker image, Ansible collection, or package, state the trust posture (verified publisher, version + SHA pinning).
