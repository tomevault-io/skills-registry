# Code Style Reviewer

A skill that provides professional code review based on code style principles. Claude directly analyzes code and generates detailed reports focusing on 5 core principles.

## Review Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Classes, functions, and modules should have only one responsibility. Complex functions should be split into smaller functions.

### 2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
The same logic should not be repeated. Common logic should be extracted into separate functions or utilities.

### 3. Simplicity First
Prefer simple, easy-to-understand code over complex abstractions. Avoid over-engineering.

### 4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Do not add features that are not currently needed. Remove unnecessary code written for future use.

### 5. Type Safety
Minimize the use of `any` type. When using TypeScript, define clear types.

## Instructions

### Review Process

1. **Identify Target Files**
   - Read code files to review using the Read tool
   - Understand file structure and scope

2. **Principle-by-Principle Analysis**
   - Systematically review each file against the 5 principles
   - Use Grep to find repeating patterns
   - Check naming convention consistency

3. **Generate Detailed Report**
   - Write reports organized by file
   - Provide specific improvement suggestions for each issue
   - Mark priorities:
     - **Critical**: Must be fixed
     - **Warning**: Needs improvement
     - **Suggestion**: Worth considering

4. **Provide Code Examples**
   - Present "Problem Code" vs "Improved Code" examples for each issue
   - Clearly explain the reason for the change

## Review Checklist

### Single Responsibility Principle Check
- [ ] Does the function perform only one task?
- [ ] Does the class have only one responsibility?
- [ ] Is complex logic split into smaller functions?
- [ ] Is the function length appropriate? (Recommended: under 20 lines)

### DRY Check
- [ ] Is there repeated code?
- [ ] Has common logic been extracted?
- [ ] Are config values not hardcoded?
- [ ] Can similar code structures be consolidated?

### Simplicity First Check
- [ ] Are there unnecessary abstractions?
- [ ] Are simple expressions used instead of complex syntax?
- [ ] Is there deep nesting? (Recommended: within 3 levels)
- [ ] Is there overly clever code?

### YAGNI Check
- [ ] Is there unused code?
- [ ] Are there unnecessary features added "just in case"?
- [ ] Are there removable parameters?
- [ ] Is there dead code or commented-out code?

### Type Safety Check (TypeScript)
- [ ] Is `any` type used?
- [ ] Do all function parameters have types defined?
- [ ] Are return types explicit?
- [ ] Are `interface` and `type` used appropriately?

### Naming Convention Check
- [ ] Are variable names meaningful and clear?
- [ ] Do function names start with verbs?
- [ ] Are class names nouns in PascalCase?
- [ ] Are constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE?
- [ ] Are naming conventions consistent?
