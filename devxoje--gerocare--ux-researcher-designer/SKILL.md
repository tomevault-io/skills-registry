## Persona Generator

### When to Generate Personas

Create personas when:
- Starting a new feature or product area
- Need to align team on target users
- Validating design decisions with user archetypes
- Planning user flows for specific user types

### Using the Persona Generator Script

The `persona_generator.py` script creates data-driven personas:

```bash
# Generate persona from sample data (for testing)
python .cursor/skills/ux-researcher-designer/scripts/persona_generator.py

# Generate persona from JSON data
python .cursor/skills/ux-researcher-designer/scripts/persona_generator.py json

# Example: With custom user data
python -c "
from persona_generator import PersonaGenerator, create_sample_user_data
generator = PersonaGenerator()
persona = generator.generate_persona_from_data(create_sample_user_data())
print(generator.format_persona_output(persona))
"
```

### Persona Data Structure

Provide user data in this format:

```json
[
  {
    "user_id": "user_001",
    "age": 32,
    "usage_frequency": "daily",
    "features_used": ["residents", "medications", "scheduling"],
    "primary_device": "mobile",
    "usage_context": "work",
    "tech_proficiency": 6,
    "pain_points": ["slow loading", "confusing navigation"],
    "location_type": "urban"
  }
]
```

### Interview Insights Format

Optional interview data to enrich personas:

```json
[
  {
    "quotes": ["I need to quickly log medication while on rounds"],
    "motivations": ["Efficiency", "Accuracy"],
    "goals": ["Save time", "Reduce errors"],
    "values": ["Reliability", "Simplicity"]
  }
]
```

### Persona Archetypes

The generator identifies four common archetypes:

1. **Power User**
   - Characteristics: Tech-savvy, frequent user, efficiency-focused
   - Goals: Maximize productivity, access advanced features
   - Frustrations: Slow performance, limited customization

2. **Casual User**
   - Characteristics: Occasional user, prefers simplicity
   - Goals: Accomplish specific tasks, minimal learning curve
   - Frustrations: Complexity, unclear navigation

3. **Business User**
   - Characteristics: Professional context, ROI-focused, team collaboration
   - Goals: Improve team efficiency, track metrics
   - Frustrations: Lack of reporting, poor collaboration features

4. **Mobile First**
   - Characteristics: Primarily mobile, on-the-go usage
   - Goals: Access anywhere, quick actions, offline capability
   - Frustrations: Poor mobile experience, desktop-only features

### Persona Output Structure

Generated personas include:

- **Demographics**: Age range, location, occupation, tech proficiency
- **Psychographics**: Motivations, values, attitudes, lifestyle
- **Behaviors**: Usage patterns, feature preferences, interaction style
- **Needs & Goals**: Primary/secondary goals, functional/emotional needs
- **Frustrations**: Top pain points from data
- **Scenarios**: Typical usage scenarios with context
- **Design Implications**: Actionable insights for design decisions

---

## Journey Mapping Process

### 1. Identify Journey Stages

For GeroCare caregivers, typical journey stages:

```
Awareness → Onboarding → Daily Use → Advanced Features → Advocacy
```

Or for specific tasks:
```
Task Discovery → Access → Execute → Verify → Document
```

### 2. Map Touchpoints

For each stage, identify:
- **Actions**: What the user does
- **Thoughts**: What they're thinking
- **Feelings**: Emotional state
- **Pain Points**: Frustrations or barriers
- **Opportunities**: Improvement areas

### 3. Document Journey

Create journey map artifacts:
- User flow diagrams
- Emotion curves (high/low points)
- Pain point prioritization
- Opportunity matrices

---

## Usability Testing Framework

### Planning a Test

1. **Define Objectives**
   - What features/flows to test
   - What questions to answer
   - Success criteria

2. **Recruit Participants**
   - Match personas/target users
   - 5-8 participants typically sufficient
   - Mix of experience levels

3. **Create Tasks**
   - Realistic scenarios
   - Clear success criteria
   - Open-ended enough to reveal issues

Example tasks for GeroCare:
- "Log medication administration for Resident Smith"
- "Find schedule for next week's shifts"
- "Report an incident that happened this morning"

4. **Prepare Test Environment**
   - Prototype or live system
   - Screen recording setup
   - Note-taking template

### Conducting Tests

1. **Introduction** (5 min)
   - Explain purpose
   - Set expectations
   - Get consent

2. **Background Questions** (5 min)
   - Understand user context
   - Experience level
   - Current workflow

3. **Task Scenarios** (20-30 min)
   - Present one task at a time
   - Observe without helping
   - Note pain points and successes

4. **Post-Task Interview** (10 min)
   - Overall impressions
   - What worked/confused
   - Suggestions

### Analyzing Results

1. **Categorize Issues**
   - Critical (blocks completion)
   - Major (causes frustration)
   - Minor (nice to fix)

2. **Find Patterns**
   - Issues multiple users encountered
   - Common workarounds
   - Feature gaps

3. **Prioritize Fixes**
   - Impact × Frequency
   - Effort to fix
   - Business priorities

---

## Research Synthesis

### Transforming Data to Insights

1. **Quantitative Analysis**
   - Usage frequency
   - Feature adoption
   - Success/completion rates
   - Time on task

2. **Qualitative Analysis**
   - Interview themes
   - Common quotes
   - Emotional responses
   - Unmet needs

3. **Identify Patterns**
   - Recurring themes
   - User segments
   - Behavioral clusters
   - Pain point categories

4. **Generate Insights**
   - User needs statements
   - Design implications
   - Feature opportunities
   - Prioritization recommendations

### Insight Format

Structure insights as:

```
**Insight**: [What we learned]
**Evidence**: [Data/observations supporting it]
**Implication**: [What this means for design]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Recommendation**: [Specific action to take]
```

Example:

```
**Insight**: Caregivers need quick access to resident info while mobile
**Evidence**: 78% use mobile devices, frequent "on-the-go" contexts mentioned
**Implication**: Mobile-first design critical, offline capabilities needed
**Priority**: High
**Recommendation**: Prioritize mobile UX improvements, add offline sync
```
