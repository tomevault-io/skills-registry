# Tycho Cloudwatch Logs

## Overview
Use AWS CLI to inspect Tycho simulation logs in CloudWatch. Default log group is `/ecs/tycho-simulator` in `eu-central-1`. Logs are JSON from `tracing_subscriber`, so queries parse `@message` to extract `msg`, `level`, and structured fields.

If you hit `ExpiredTokenException`, refresh the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` in `.env` and retry.

Simulate completion logs are now emitted at `info` level for successful requests and include extra context (tokens, latency, top pool details, and failure summaries). For detailed failure summaries, inspect the raw `@message` JSON.
The raw completion logs emit wire-aligned `quote_status`, `quote_result_quality`, and `partial_kind`; the bundled query presets map those back to concise columns for triage.
`token-rpc-fetch` is most useful for failures under the default log level; the success path only appears when `RUST_LOG=debug`.
`uniswap-v4-filter` logs include `filter_rule`, `considered_pools`, `accepted_pools`, `filtered_pools`, `pools_with_hook_identifier`, and `pools_missing_hook_identifier` to explain hook-pool coverage.

## Quick start
0. Who am I / which env: `zsh skills/tycho-cloudwatch-logs/scripts/cw_whoami.zsh`
1. List recent streams: `zsh skills/tycho-cloudwatch-logs/scripts/cw_streams.zsh --limit 10`
2. Tail (JSON pretty print): `zsh skills/tycho-cloudwatch-logs/scripts/cw_tail.zsh --since 15m --follow`
3. Filter: `zsh skills/tycho-cloudwatch-logs/scripts/cw_filter.zsh --since 2h --filter-pattern "Block update:"`
4. Query: `zsh skills/tycho-cloudwatch-logs/scripts/cw_query.zsh --preset resync --since 24h`

## ERC4626 rollout checks
For ERC4626 `/simulate` rollout triage, use the existing presets instead of adding a new one:
`simulate-requests`, `simulate-completions`, `simulate-successes`, and `simulate-runs`.

Use `simulate-completions` when you need to inspect degraded `ready` outcomes. `simulate-successes` is intentionally narrower and only shows quoteable `ready` completions (`result_quality=complete|partial`).

Supported ERC4626 directions on this server today:
- `USDS -> sUSDS`
- `sUSDS -> USDS`
- `USDC -> sUSDC`
- `sUSDC -> USDC`
- `PYUSD -> spPYUSD`
- `spPYUSD -> PYUSD`

Negative probe to keep handy:
- `sUSDe -> USDe`

Current observability limits:
- ERC4626 candidate drops are still logged at `debug`, so those per-candidate skip reasons remain invisible in CloudWatch under the default `info` log level.
- Unsupported ERC4626 `/encode` rejections are now visible in CloudWatch, but there is still no dedicated preset for them.
- General `/encode` traffic still does not include enough pair or protocol detail to isolate all ERC4626 activity reliably in CloudWatch.
- `router-timeouts` covers both `/simulate` and `/encode` router-boundary timeout logs, but it is not pair-aware.

Start with `references/queries.md` for copyable ERC4626 pair filters built on top of the existing presets.

## Preset catalog

| stream-supervision | Stream supervision and restart lifecycle. |
| vm-rebuild | VM rebuild lifecycle. |
| startup | App boot sequence. |
| server | HTTP server lifecycle. |

## Scripts
- `scripts/cw_streams.zsh`: list recent log streams by last event time.
- `scripts/cw_tail.zsh`: live tail with optional filter and stream prefix (default format: json).
- `scripts/cw_filter.zsh`: time-window search with filter patterns.
- `scripts/cw_query.zsh`: Logs Insights queries with presets and JSON parsing.
- `scripts/cw_query_ceiling.py`: windowed preset runner with safety ceilings (`max_rows`, `max_scanned_gb`, `max_queries`).
- `scripts/cw_metrics.zsh`: memory/cpu metrics summaries and time series.
- `scripts/analyze_snapshot.py`: render a production snapshot markdown report from query + metrics JSON outputs.
- `scripts/cw_time.py`: time parsing helper for `cw_filter`, `cw_query`, and `cw_metrics`.

## Snapshot report workflow
- Prompt source: `~/.codex/prompts/sim-report.md`.
- Default period in the prompt is `12h` when no argument is provided.
- Default sampling mode for snapshot reports uses a single query with `--limit 10000` for `simulate-runs` and `simulate-completions`, regardless of time window.
- Use `cw_query_ceiling.py` for `simulate-runs` and `simulate-completions` only when the user explicitly requests broader sampling coverage.
- Explicit coverage directives can be expressed as `sample 50%`, `up to 1m logs`, or `sample 50% up to 1m logs`.
- When expanded coverage is explicitly requested, keep safety ceilings enabled:
  `max_rows=6000000`, `max_scanned_gb=60`, `max_queries=1200`, `window_seconds=900`.
- Required generated files for the analyzer:
  `simulate-runs-per-minute.json`, `simulate-runs-per-auction.json`,
  `simulate-runs.json`, `simulate-requests-per-auction.json`,
  `simulate-completions.json`, `simulate-workload-summary.json`,
  `cw-metrics.json`.

## Metrics
Quick checks for memory and CPU utilization using ECS ContainerInsights.

- Memory + CPU summary + series:
  `zsh skills/tycho-cloudwatch-logs/scripts/cw_metrics.zsh --since 12h --metrics memory,cpu`
- Pivot spike check:
  `zsh skills/tycho-cloudwatch-logs/scripts/cw_metrics.zsh --since 2h --pivot 2026-02-04T11:38:00Z --window 10m`

## Override defaults
- Set `TYCHO_LOG_GROUP` for another log group.
- Set `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` for another region.
- Set `TYCHO_ECS_CLUSTER` or `TYCHO_ECS_SERVICE` to override ECS defaults for metrics.
- Pass `--log-group` on any script to override.

## References
Use `references/queries.md` for the full preset index and filter/query snippets.
Use [docs/quote_service.md](../../docs/quote_service.md) for the `/simulate` quote-status, result-quality, and partial-kind contract.
