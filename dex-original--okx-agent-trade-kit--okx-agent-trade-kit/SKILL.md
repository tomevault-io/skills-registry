# OKX News & Sentiment

Crypto news aggregation and coin sentiment analysis for OKX. All commands are **read-only** and require **API credentials** (OAuth2.1).

## Capabilities

| User Intent | Command |
|-------------|---------|
| Latest/important news | `okx news latest` |
| Coin-specific news | `okx news by-coin` |
| Keyword news search | `okx news search` |
| Sentiment-filtered news | `okx news by-sentiment` |
| Full article content | `okx news detail` |
| Coin sentiment snapshot | `okx news coin-sentiment` |
| Sentiment trend | `okx news coin-trend` |
| Sentiment ranking | `okx news sentiment-rank` |
| News source list | `okx news platforms` |

## Prerequisites

1. Install `okx` CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @okx_ai/okx-trade-cli
   ```
2. Configure credentials in `~/.okx/config.toml`
3. Verify setup:
   ```bash
   okx news latest --limit 3
   ```

OKX News does not support demo mode. Always use `--profile live` silently — don't mention it unless there's an error.

**On "not available in demo" errors:** the user's current profile is configured with demo/simulated credentials. Tell the user: "News module does not support demo mode. Please switch to a live profile." Guide them to either:
- Use `--profile live` if a live profile exists: `okx --profile live news latest`
- Or create one: `okx config add-profile AK=<key> SK=<secret> PP=<passphrase> name=live`

All commands support `--json` for raw JSON output.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Latest news
okx news latest --limit 5

# Today's important news
okx news important --begin $(date -d 'today 00:00:00' +%s000 2>/dev/null || date -v0H -v0M -v0S +%s000)

# BTC news
okx news by-coin --coins BTC

# Search for SEC ETF news
okx news search --keyword "SEC ETF"

# BTC sentiment overview
okx news coin-sentiment --coins BTC

# Trending coins (hottest right now)
okx news sentiment-rank
```

## Intent → Command Mapping

### Browse News

`latest`, `by-coin`, and `search` default `--importance low`, which returns **all** news (both high and low importance). Pass `--importance high` only when the user explicitly asks for major / breaking / important news. The dedicated `okx news important` command is a shortcut for that case.

| User says | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| "what's been happening in crypto lately" / "catch me up on recent news" | `okx news latest` |
| "any big news today" / "what are the major stories right now" | `okx news important` |
| "what happened in crypto yesterday" | `okx news latest --begin <yesterday_0am> --end <today_0am>` |
| "any news on BTC recently" / "what's going on with BTC" | `okx news by-coin --coins BTC` |
| "any major updates on ETH or SOL" | `okx news by-coin --coins ETH,SOL --importance high` |

### Search News

| User says | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| "any updates on the SEC ETF decision" | `okx news search --keyword "SEC ETF"` |
| "what's the latest on stablecoin regulation" | `okx news search --keyword "stablecoin regulation"` |
| "any news about the Bitcoin halving" | `okx news search --keyword "Bitcoin halving"` |

### Coin Sentiment Analysis

| User says | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| "is the market bullish or bearish on BTC right now" / "how do people feel about BTC" | `okx news coin-sentiment --coins BTC` |
| "compare how people feel about ETH vs SOL" | `okx news coin-sentiment --coins ETH,SOL` |
| "how has BTC sentiment changed over the past 24 hours" | `okx news coin-trend BTC --period 1h --points 24` |
| "show me BTC sentiment over the past week" | `okx news coin-trend BTC --period 24h --points 7` |
| "what's hot in crypto right now" / "which coins are getting the most attention" | `okx news sentiment-rank` |
| "which coins are people most excited about" / "top bullish coins" | `okx news sentiment-rank --sort-by bullish` |
| "which coins have the most negative sentiment" | `okx news sentiment-rank --sort-by bearish` |

### Sentiment Anomaly Detection (multi-coin)

| User says | Workflow |
|-----------|---------|
| "哪些币种情绪变化最大" / "any sentiment anomalies" / "which coins flipped sentiment" | → [Anomaly Detection workflow](references/workflows.md#sentiment-anomaly-detection--multi-coin-scan) |
| "过去一周有什么异动" / "sudden sentiment shifts" / "sentiment reversal" | → [Anomaly Detection workflow](references/workflows.md#sentiment-anomaly-detection--multi-coin-scan) |
| "有没有突然转看涨/看跌的" / "any coins turning bullish/bearish" | → [Anomaly Detection workflow](references/workflows.md#sentiment-anomaly-detection--multi-coin-scan) |

These queries require a **broad-then-deep** approach: first scan all coins for anomalies, then deep-dive with news correlation. Follow the multi-phase workflow in `references/workflows.md` — do NOT just pick a few coins to analyze.

### Source-Filtered News

Use `--platform` to filter by news source directly. Always resolve the exact value from `okx news platforms` — do not guess platform identifiers from the user's wording.

| User says | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| "ChainCatcher 最近报道了什么" / "show me news from ChainCatcher" | `okx news latest --platform <platform_id> --limit 10` |
| "Odaily 有什么新闻" / "news from TechFlowPost" | `okx news latest --platform <platform_id> --limit 10` |
| "吴说区块链最近有什么" / "news from a specific outlet" | `okx news latest --platform <platform_id> --limit 20` |

**Important**: When filtering by source, use a larger `--limit` (10–20) to maximize results, since individual sources typically have fewer articles than the aggregated feed. `--importance low` (the default) is the right setting here; do not narrow to `--importance high`.

**Posting cadence is uneven across platforms.** The API defaults `--begin` to 72 hours ago, which is too narrow for bursty sources and will often return 0 results. If a `--platform`-filtered query returns fewer than ~5 items (or 0), **retry with `--begin` set to 7 days back, then 30 days back** before concluding the source has no data. Resolve candidate platform IDs from `okx news platforms`; do not hardcode assumptions about which platforms are active.

## Cross-Skill Workflows

See [references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md) for multi-step scenarios (market overview, daily briefing, etc.) and full MCP tool → CLI mapping.

               [--limit 10] [--after <cursor>] [--json]
```

`--importance` default is `low` (returns all news). Pass `--importance high` only for breaking / major news.

---

### `okx news platforms`
List available news platforms. Use the returned values with `--platform` on `latest`, `by-coin`, or `search` commands to filter by source.

```bash
okx news platforms [--json]
```

---

### `okx news coin-sentiment`
Get current sentiment snapshot for specific coins.

```bash
okx news coin-sentiment --coins <BTC,ETH,...>
               [--period 1h|4h|24h]  # aggregation granularity, default 24h

| `news_get_sentiment_ranking` | Coin ranking by hotness or sentiment direction |

## Coin Symbol Normalization

The API only accepts standard uppercase ticker symbols (e.g. `BTC`, `ETH`, `SOL`). Users may refer to coins by full names, abbreviations, slang, or local-language nicknames. Always resolve these to the correct ticker before passing to any command. If the intended coin is ambiguous, ask the user to confirm before querying.

## Empty Results & Web Search Fallback

OKX news data may be sparse for niche coins or highly specific keyword searches. The API default `--begin` window is only 72 hours, which alone accounts for many empty results. When a command returns empty or insufficient results, apply these steps in order — do not skip to web search:

1. **If `--platform` was used** — broaden `--begin` to 7 days back, then 30 days back, before changing anything else. Bursty sources routinely return 0 items in the default window but dozens over a wider range.
2. **If `--importance high` was passed** — drop it (default is already `low` = all news).
3. **Broaden `--begin` / `--end`** for any query (not just `--platform`) when a narrow time window is suspected.
4. **Drop `--coins`** to get general news if the coin-specific query yielded nothing.
5. **Use web search as a supplement** — search the web for `"<topic> news site:coindesk.com OR site:cointelegraph.com OR site:theblock.co"` to gather additional context, then combine with any OKX results into a unified briefing.
6. **Be transparent** — tell the user which results came from OKX API vs. web search so they can judge source credibility.

This fallback is especially valuable for:
- Coins with low coverage (e.g. newly listed tokens)
- Highly specific keyword searches with no matches
- `--platform` queries where the chosen source has uneven posting cadence

## Known Limitations

### Source Coverage

Platform posting cadence varies and changes over time. Some sources publish many articles per day; others post in bursts with quiet stretches in between. A source returning few or zero articles in the **default 72-hour window is not evidence that it is inactive** — it may simply not have posted recently, or its recent posts may have been deduplicated out.

Before concluding a `--platform`-filtered query has no data:

1. Broaden `--begin` to 7 days back, then 30 days back, and retry.
2. If still empty after a 30-day window, report to the user that no recent articles were found for that source and suggest either removing `--platform` (to fall back to the aggregated feed) or web search.

Do not hardcode assumptions about which platforms are active — resolve candidates from `okx news platforms` and let the data speak.

### Historical Search Limitations

`okx news search` and `okx news by-coin` primarily index **recent articles** (typically today and recent days). Searching with `--begin`/`--end` for dates more than ~7 days ago may return empty results even if articles existed at that time. This is an API indexing limitation, not a data absence.

For historical analysis, `okx news coin-trend` (sentiment trend data) is more reliable than article search — it retains time-series data for longer periods.

## Edge Cases

- **Pagination**: use `--after <cursor>` to get next page; cursor comes from `nextCursor` in response
- **Time parameters**: `--begin` / `--end` are Unix epoch milliseconds
- **Coins format**: comma-separated uppercase symbols, e.g. `BTC,ETH,SOL` — never pass full names or aliases
- **coin-trend `--points`**: always pass explicitly; 1h→24, 4h→6, 24h→7
- **Language**: inferred from user's message — `--lang zh-CN` for Chinese, `--lang en-US` for English (default)
- **sentiment-rank `--sort-by`**: `hot`=by mention count (default), `bullish`=most bullish, `bearish`=most bearish
