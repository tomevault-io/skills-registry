Use when the user says "Create Issue", "create issue", or asks to turn chat discussion into Todoist tasks in Huntable CTI Studio. Use when this capability is needed.

# Create Issue

Turns chat-surfaced problems/bugs (or user-provided text) into Todoist tasks in the **Huntable CTI Studio** project. Default section: **Intake**. User may override with a section name (e.g. "Up Next", "WIP").

## When to use

- User says "Create Issue" or "create issue"
- User asks to log bugs/tasks from the conversation in Huntable CTI Studio/Todoist

## Workflow

### 1. Gather content

- **If user did not provide title/description:** Summarize problems or bugs from the open chat into a single, clear issue (or one per distinct problem if that’s what the user wants).
- **If user provided title and/or description:** Use those; fill in only what’s missing from the chat.

### 2. Propose draft

Output a single **Create Issue Proposal** in this shape:

```markdown
## Create Issue Proposal

**Title:** [Short, actionable title]

**Description:** [1–3 sentences: what’s wrong, where it shows up, impact if obvious]

**Section:** Intake *(or user-specified: Up Next | WIP | Someday / Maybe)*

**Subtasks:** *(none | or list below)*
- **1.** [Subtask title] — [Brief description]
- **2.** …
```

- **Subtasks:** Add them only when the issue naturally breaks into 2+ concrete, separate steps or sub-bugs. Otherwise use "*(none)*".

Do **not** call Todoist yet. Ask for approval, e.g. “Approve to create in Huntable CTI Studio?” or “Say 'yes' / 'go' to create, or edit Title/Description/Section/Subtasks.”

### 3. Apply user feedback

- If the user edits Title, Description, Section, or Subtasks, update the proposal and repeat until they approve (or cancel).

### 4. Create in Todoist (only after approval)

When the user clearly approves (e.g. “yes”, “go”, “create it”):

1. **Resolve project and section** (official Todoist MCP: **find-projects**, **find-sections**)
   - Call **find-projects** with `{"search": "Huntable CTI Studio"}` (or no search and find by name in the list). Get the project `id` for Huntable CTI Studio.
   - Call **find-sections** with `{"projectId": "<Huntable CTI Studio id>", "search": "<Section>"}` (e.g. `"Intake"`) or omit search and find the section by name. Get the section `id`. Match case-insensitively; normalize "Up Next", "WIP", "Someday / Maybe" if needed.

2. **Create the main task** (official Todoist MCP: **add-tasks**)
   - Call **add-tasks** with `{"tasks": [{"content": "<Title>", "description": "<Description>", "projectId": "<Huntable CTI Studio id>", "sectionId": "<resolved section id>"}]}`. From the response, capture the created task’s `id` for subtasks.

3. **Create subtasks** (if any)
   - Call **add-tasks** with `{"tasks": [{"content": "<Subtask title>", "parentId": "<main task id>"}, ...]}` for each subtask (optionally include `description` per subtask). Subtasks inherit project/section from the parent.

4. **Report**
   - Confirm: main task (+ link if returned) and count of subtasks created.
   - If section or project couldn’t be resolved, say what failed and do not create.

## Section names

Use the **exact** section names from the Huntable CTI Studio board when matching (after normalizing case):

- **Intake** (default)
- **Up Next**
- **WIP**
- **Someday / Maybe**
- **Cancelled** (use only if user explicitly asks for it)

## Tool reference (Official Todoist MCP: https://ai.todoist.net/mcp)

- **find-projects**: `{"search": "Huntable CTI Studio"}` (or omit for all) → returns projects with `id`, `name`. Use Huntable CTI Studio’s `id`.
- **find-sections**: `{"projectId": "<project id>", "search": "Intake"}` (or omit search) → returns sections with `id`, `name`. Use section’s `id`.
- **add-tasks**: `{"tasks": [{"content": "...", "description": "...", "projectId": "...", "sectionId": "..."}]}` for main task; response includes created task `id`. For subtasks: `{"tasks": [{"content": "...", "parentId": "<main task id>"}, ...]}`.

**Setup:** Uses OAuth (no token in config). Restart Cursor after editing `.cursor/mcp.json`. On first use, complete the Todoist sign-in when prompted.

## Example proposal

```markdown
## Create Issue Proposal

**Title:** Dashboard sort drops active filters when changing column

**Description:** On the Articles table, changing sort by column clears current filters (source, date range). Reproduces in Chrome; need to confirm other browsers.

**Section:** Intake

**Subtasks:**
- **1.** Reproduce and document exact steps — Include screen, filters, and sort column.
- **2.** Fix filter reset on sort change — Preserve existing filters when sort is updated.
```

After user says “yes” or “go”, resolve Huntable CTI Studio + Intake, create the main task, then the two subtasks with `parentId` set to that task’s id.
