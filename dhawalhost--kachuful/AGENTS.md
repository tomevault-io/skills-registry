# Kachuful Scorer - Antigravity Development Guide

> **Project:** Kachuful Card Game Scoring Application  
> **AI Agent:** Antigravity by Google Deepmind  
> **Purpose:** Step-by-step guide for building the app using Antigravity

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This application tracks scores for **Kachuful** (also called Judgement), a trick-taking card game popular in India. The app automates score calculation, manages rounds, and provides statistics.

**Key Game Mechanics:**
- 2-10 players predict exact number of tricks they'll win
- Scoring: `10 + predicted tricks` if accurate, `0` if wrong
- Dealer restriction: Last bidder can't make total bids equal total tricks
- Trump rotates: Spades → Diamonds → Clubs → Hearts → No Trump

---

## 📋 Reference Documents

Before starting implementation, review these planning documents:

1. **[PRD](file:///.gemini/antigravity/brain/4f5f27a6-635a-416f-8e82-d5fe0272b2bc/prd.md)** - Complete requirements and game rules
2. **[Roadmap](file:///.gemini/antigravity/brain/4f5f27a6-635a-416f-8e82-d5fe0272b2bc/roadmap.md)** - 8-week development plan

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: MVP Development (Weeks 1-3)

### Step 1: Project Initialization

**Prompt for Antigravity:**
```
Create a new Kachuful scoring app using Vite + React + TypeScript.

Requirements:
- Initialize project with: npx create-vite@latest ./ --template react-ts
- Setup Tailwind CSS for styling
- Create folder structure:
  /src
    /components  (UI components)
    /lib         (game logic)
    /types       (TypeScript types)
    /hooks       (custom React hooks)
    /styles      (global styles)
- Create design system with tokens for colors, spacing, typography

Follow web application best practices with premium, modern aesthetics.
```

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Working React + TypeScript + Tailwind setup
- Folder structure created
- Initial `design-tokens.css` or equivalent

---

### Step 2: Core Game Logic

**Prompt for Antigravity:**
```
Implement the core Kachuful game logic in /src/lib/game-logic.ts

Requirements:
1. Create TypeScript types/interfaces:
   - Player
   - Round
   - GameState
   - ScoringVariant

2. Implement functions:
   - calculateScore(predicted: number, actual: number, variant: ScoringVariant): number
   - validateBids(bids: number[], totalTricks: number, dealerIndex: number): boolean
   - getTrumpSuit(roundNumber: number): 'spades' | 'diamonds' | 'clubs' | 'hearts' | 'none'
   - getCardsDealt(roundNumber: number, totalRounds: number): number
   - isGameComplete(currentRound: number, totalRounds: number): boolean

3. Default scoring: 10 + predicted if exact match, 0 if wrong
4. Dealer restriction: Total bids cannot equal total tricks available
5. Trump rotation: ♠️ → ♦️ → ♣️ → ♥️ → No Trump (cycles)

Write comprehensive unit tests for all logic.
```

**Expected Deliverables:**
- `game-logic.ts` with all functions
- Type definitions in `types/game.ts`
- Unit tests passing

---

### Step 3: Game Setup Screen

Requirements:
1. Display current round info:
   - Round number (e.g., "Round 3 of 13")
   - Cards dealt this round
   - Trump suit (with colored suit icon)
   - Current dealer

2. Bid entry for each player:
   - Show player name
   - Buttons 0-[max tricks] for bid selection
   - Highlight selected bid
   - Disable invalid bids for dealer (dealer restriction)

3. Validation:
   - Show warning if dealer's bid makes total = total tricks
   - All players must bid before proceeding

4. Premium design:
   - Large bid buttons (0-13)
   - Smooth animations when selecting
   - Progress indicator (3 of 4 players bid)
   - Visual feedback for dealer restriction

5. On complete: Move to tricks entry screen

Make it mobile-first with excellent touch targets.
```

**Expected Deliverables:**
- `BiddingScreen.tsx` component
- Dealer restriction validation working
- Polished UI with animations

---

### Step 5: Tricks Entry & Scoring

**Prompt for Antigravity:**
```
Create the Tricks Entry screen in /src/components/TricksEntry.tsx

Requirements:
1. After round is played physically, players enter tricks won
2. For each player:
   - Show name, bid amount
   - Stepper or number input for tricks won (0-[cards dealt])
   - Visual indicator if prediction matched

3. Auto-calculate scores when all tricks entered:
   - Use scoring algorithm from game-logic.ts
   - Show individual round scores
   - Update cumulative scores

4. Display:
   - Success indicator (green checkmark) if bid matched
   - Failure indicator (red X) if bid missed
   - Points earned this round

5. Action buttons:
   - "Next Round" → move to next bidding round
   - "View Scoreboard" → see full scores

Premium design with celebratory animations for successful predictions.
```

**Expected Deliverables:**
- `TricksEntry.tsx` component
- Score calculation integrated
- Smooth transitions

---

### Step 6: Scoreboard

Requirements:
1. Table layout showing:
   - Player names (column headers or row headers)
   - Each round as row/column
   - Bid vs Actual for each round (e.g., "3/3 ✓" or "2/5 ✗")
   - Round score for each player
   - Cumulative total score (bold/highlighted)

2. Visual features:
   - Highlight current leader (gold border/background)
   - Color-code successful vs failed predictions
   - Responsive table (horizontal scroll on mobile if needed)
   - Sort by rank option

3. Summary stats:
   - Total rounds played
   - Rounds remaining
   - Current leader

4. Actions:
   - Continue to next round
   - View detailed breakdown
   - End game (if final round)

Use premium table design with card-game theming.
```

**Expected Deliverables:**
- `Scoreboard.tsx` component
- Responsive table layout
- Leader highlighting

---

### Step 7: Game State Management

**Prompt for Antigravity:**
```
Implement game state management using React Context or Zustand

Requirements:
1. Create global game state including:
   - Players array
   - Current round number
   - Rounds array (history of bids/tricks/scores)
   - Game settings (scoring variant, total rounds)
   - Game status (setup, bidding, playing, complete)

2. Actions:
   - initializeGame(settings)
   - submitBids(bids)
   - submitTricks(tricks)
   - nextRound()
   - endGame()
   - resetGame()

3. Persistence:
   - Save state to localStorage on every update
   - Load state on app mount
   - Handle corrupted data gracefully

4. Type safety:

   /bidding → Bidding Screen
   /tricks → Tricks Entry
   /scoreboard → Scoreboard
   /results → Final Results (winner announcement)

2. Navigation guards:
   - Redirect to setup if no active game
   - Prevent accessing future rounds

3. Layout:
   - Shared header with game info (round, scores)
   - Navigation breadcrumbs
   - Exit/Quit game button

4. Transitions:
   - Smooth page transitions
   - Loading states where needed

Setup proper routing with state-aware navigation.
```

**Expected Deliverables:**
- React Router setup
- All screens connected

---

### Step 9: Winner Declaration

**Prompt for Antigravity:**
```
Create the Final Results screen in /src/components/FinalResults.tsx

Requirements:
1. Display after last round:
   - 🏆 Winner announcement with celebration
   - Final rankings (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)
   - Total scores for all players
   - Game statistics:
     - Most successful predictions
     - Highest single-round score
     - Average bid accuracy

2. Visual design:

---

## 🧪 Testing Prompts

### Unit Testing
```
Write comprehensive unit tests for game logic:
- Test all scoring variants
- Test dealer restriction validation
- Test trump rotation
- Test edge cases (0 bids, max bids)
- Use Vitest or Jest
- Aim for 90%+ code coverage
```

### Integration Testing
```
Add integration tests for user flows:
- Complete game flow (setup → bidding → tricks → results)
- State persistence and restoration
- Navigation between screens
- Error scenarios
- Use React Testing Library
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Prompts

**Issue:** Scoring calculation incorrect
```
Debug the scoring calculation in game-logic.ts:
- Add detailed console logs for predicted vs actual
- Verify formula: 10 + predicted (if match), else 0
- Test with edge case: 0 predicted, 0 actual → should be 10 points
- Check for off-by-one errors
```

**Issue:** Mobile UI not responsive
```
Fix mobile responsiveness:
- Use Tailwind responsive classes (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Test bid buttons are min 44px touch targets
- Ensure tables scroll horizontally on small screens
- Check text sizes are readable (min 16px)
- Test on iPhone SE (375px width)
```

**Issue:** State not persisting
```
Debug localStorage persistence:
- Console log state before saving
- Check localStorage in DevTools
- Verify JSON serialization doesn't lose data
- Add error handling for QuotaExceeded
- Test state restoration on page reload
```
