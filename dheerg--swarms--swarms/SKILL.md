Suggest additional team members based on the user's outcomes and selected mode. The lead and facilitator are always included.

**Mode guidance:**
- **Code mode** — suggest a mix of technical and domain-specific voices. Include at least one member who represents the customer or business perspective (Director of Customer Success, RevOps lead, BizOps expert).
- **Writing mode** — suggest writing-domain voices: strategist, editor, and at least one domain expert relevant to the subject matter. Researcher as needed. Avoid engineering roles unless the subject requires them.
- **General mode** — suggest domain-relevant voices that match what the outcomes actually require. Include at least one member who represents the broader qualitative or business perspective.
- **Triage mode** — suggest investigators who can gather and weigh evidence from where the symptom points (code, logs, metrics, traces, issue history, user reports); keep roles tool-agnostic (no hardcoded observability vendor); include at least one voice attentive to blast radius — what a change at the breaking point would disturb downstream. Do not apply the Code-mode customer/business-perspective default unless the outcomes call for it.
- **No mode provided** — default to Code mode guidance.

Keep teams to 3-5 members total. Up to 8 for complex multi-domain work. All members except the lead are read-only.

Present your suggestion.

Rules when suggesting team members:
- Avoid constraining dynamic team members too much. Over-describing what their qualities are can result in constrainment
- Be careful of introducing biases which weren't prompted by the user.
