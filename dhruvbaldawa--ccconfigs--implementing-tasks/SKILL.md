# Implementation

Given task file path `.plans/<project>/implementation/NNN-task.md`:

## Process

### Load Critical Patterns (if exists)

Before starting implementation, check for `.plans/<project>/critical-patterns.md`:
- If exists, read and internalize all patterns
- Apply matching patterns during implementation
- Violations will be flagged as CRITICAL in review

**Use TodoWrite to track implementation progress:**
```
☐ Read task file (LLM Prompt, Working Result, Validation)
☐ [LLM Prompt step 1]
☐ [LLM Prompt step 2]
...
☐ Write tests for new functionality
☐ Run full test suite
☐ Mark validation checkboxes
☐ Update status to READY_FOR_TESTING
```

Convert each step from the task's LLM Prompt into a todo. Mark completed as you progress.

1. Read task file - LLM Prompt, Working Result, Validation, Files
2. Follow LLM Prompt step-by-step, write code + tests, run full suite
3. Update task status using Edit tool:
   - For initial implementation: `**Status:** READY_FOR_TESTING`
   - For revision after rejection: `**Status:** READY_FOR_REVIEW` (skip testing, go back to review)
4. Append implementation notes using Edit tool (add to end of task file):
   ```markdown
   **implementation:**
   - Followed LLM Prompt steps 1-N
   - Implemented [key functionality]
   - Added [N] tests: all passing
   - Full test suite: [M]/[M] passing
   - Working Result verified: ✓ [description]
   - Files: [list with brief descriptions]
   ```
5. Mark validation checkboxes: `[ ]` → `[x]` using Edit tool
6. Report completion

## Stuck Handling

When blocked during implementation:

### 1. Mark Task as Stuck
- Update status using Edit tool:
  - Find: `**Status:** [current status]`
  - Replace: `**Status:** STUCK`
- Append notes using Edit tool (add to end of task file):
  ```markdown
  **implementation:**
  - Attempted [what tried]
  - BLOCKED: [specific issue]
  - Launching research agents to investigate...
  ```

### 2. Launch Research Agents

Based on blocker type, launch 2-3 agents in parallel:

**New technology/framework** → `research-breadth` + `research-technical`:
- research-breadth: General understanding of technology/approach
- research-technical: Official API documentation

**Specific error/issue** → `research-depth` + `research-technical`:
- research-depth: Detailed analysis of specific solutions
- research-technical: Official API documentation

**API integration** → `research-technical` + `research-depth`:
- research-technical: Official API documentation
- research-depth: Detailed implementation examples

**Best practices/patterns** → `research-breadth` + `research-depth`:
- research-breadth: General surveys and comparisons
- research-depth: Detailed analysis of specific approaches

Example:
```bash
# Launch agents with specific questions
research-breadth "How to [solve blocker]?"
research-depth "Detailed solutions for [specific issue]"
research-technical "[library/framework] official documentation for [feature]"
```

### 3. Synthesize Findings

Use research-synthesis skill (from essentials) to:
- Consolidate findings from all agents
- Identify concrete path forward
- Extract actionable implementation guidance

Update task file with research findings using Edit tool (add to end of task file):
```markdown
**research findings:**
- [Agent 1]: [key insights]
- [Agent 2]: [key insights]
- [Agent 3]: [key insights]

**resolution:**
[Concrete path forward based on research]
```

### 4. Continue or Escalate

**If unblocked:**
- Update status back to `IN_PROGRESS`
- **Capture the learning** (auto-invoked):
  ```
  Task(
    description: "Capture learning from blocker resolution",
    prompt: "Extract the learning from this resolved blocker.

    Problem context:
    - STUCK notes: [from task file]
    - Research findings: [from task file]

    Resolution:
    - What worked: [resolution notes]
    - Task: [task file path]

    Generate a learning document following the template in experimental/templates/learning.md.
    Save to: .plans/<project>/learnings/[YYYYMMDD-NNN-slug].md
    Update: .plans/<project>/learnings/index.md with new entry",
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    model: "haiku"
  )
  ```
- Resume implementation following research guidance
- Complete normally as per main Process section

**If still stuck after research:**
- Keep status as `STUCK`
- Append escalation notes using Edit tool (add to end of task file):
  ```markdown
  **escalation:**
  - Research completed but blocker remains
  - Reason: [why research didn't unblock]
  - Need: [what's needed - human decision, missing requirement, etc.]
  ```
- Then STOP and report blocker with full context.

## Rejection Handling

If task moved back from review (check for `**review:**` notes in task file):
1. Read review notes for blocking issues
2. Fix all CRITICAL and HIGH issues
3. Update status to `READY_FOR_REVIEW` (go back to review, skip testing)
4. Append revision notes:
   ```
   **implementation (revision):**
   - Fixed [issue 1]
   - Fixed [issue 2]
   - Re-ran tests: [M]/[M] passing
   ```

## Test Fix Handling

If task moved back from testing (check for `**testing:**` notes with NEEDS_FIX):
1. Read testing notes for failures
2. Fix the failing tests or code
3. Update status to `READY_FOR_TESTING` (go back to testing)
4. Append fix notes:
   ```
   **implementation (test fix):**
   - Fixed [test issue]
   - Re-ran tests: [M]/[M] passing
   ```

## Completion

When implementation is complete:
- Initial implementation: Status = `READY_FOR_TESTING`
- After review rejection: Status = `READY_FOR_REVIEW`
- After test failure: Status = `READY_FOR_TESTING`

### Collect Implementation Metadata

Before setting final status, collect metadata for review triage:

```markdown
**implementation_metadata:**
- files_changed: [count from git diff --stat]
- lines_changed: [insertions + deletions from git diff --stat]
- was_stuck: [true/false - was task ever marked STUCK?]
- research_agents_used: [list agents invoked, or 'none']
- severity_indicators: [list any detected: auth, crypto, payment, database-migration, etc.]
- complexity_indicators: [list any detected: state-machine, external-api, async-patterns, etc.]
```

**Detection rules for severity_indicators:**
- Scan Files for: `auth`, `login`, `password`, `session`, `token`, `jwt`, `crypto`, `encrypt`, `secret`, `payment`, `billing`, `migration`, `permission`, `api_key`
- If any found, add to severity_indicators list

**Detection rules for complexity_indicators:**
- Check for: state machines, external API calls, async/await patterns, database queries, caching logic
- If any found, add to complexity_indicators list

This metadata enables the review skill to route to LIGHTWEIGHT or FULL review.

Report: `✅ Implementation complete. Status: [STATUS]`

## Phrase-Based Learning Capture

During implementation, watch for phrases that indicate problem resolution:
- "that worked"
- "it's fixed"
- "figured it out"
- "problem solved"
- "got it working"

When detected:
1. Pause implementation
2. Ask: "Capture this as a learning? (y/n)"
3. If yes, invoke knowledge-capturer:
   ```
   Task(
     description: "Capture learning from resolution",
     prompt: "Extract the learning from this problem resolution.

     Context:
     - What was being attempted: [from recent conversation]
     - What was tried: [approaches that failed]
     - What worked: [the resolution]
     - Task: [task file path]

     Generate a learning document following the template in experimental/templates/learning.md.
     Save to: .plans/<project>/learnings/[YYYYMMDD-NNN-slug].md
     Update: .plans/<project>/learnings/index.md with new entry",
     subagent_type: "general-purpose",
     model: "haiku"
   )
   ```
4. Resume implementation

This captures solutions while context is fresh, before details are forgotten.
