# ezCater Research Methodology

Investigate ezCater codebases, architectural decisions, and project histories using multiple data sources including Glean, Atlassian (Jira/Confluence), GitHub, and Git.

## Overview

ezCater research requires synthesizing information from multiple internal sources. This skill provides proven methodologies for:
- Finding why architectural decisions were made
- Understanding code evolution over time
- Discovering historical context for current implementations
- Researching multi-system interactions and workflows

**When to use this skill vs deep research agent:**
- **Use this skill**: Straightforward investigations, specific PR/ticket lookups, single-source searches
- **Use deep research agent**: Complex multi-source synthesis, historical timelines, architectural decision investigations requiring extensive context

## CRITICAL: Access Requirements

**Cannot access resources directly. Must use appropriate tools:**

### Google Docs / Google Drive
- ❌ **CANNOT** access Google Docs URLs directly
- ✅ **MUST** use Glean MCP tools (`mcp__glean__company_search`, `mcp__glean__chat`)
- Glean indexes Google Docs and retrieves content

### Atlassian (Jira / Confluence)
- ❌ **CANNOT** access ezcater.atlassian.net URLs directly
- ✅ **MUST** use `atl` CLI for all Jira and Confluence access
- Commands: `atl jira issue view FX-123`, `atl confluence search "keywords"`

### GitHub
- ✅ Use `gh` CLI for PR/issue searches
- ✅ Use git commands for repository analysis
- ✅ Use Read tool for files in checked out repositories

## Research Strategy by Question Type

### Architectural Decisions

"Why was X chosen over Y?"

1. **Search Glean** for design docs, RFCs, ADRs using keywords like:
   - "[feature] decision", "[component] architecture", "why [technology]"
2. **Find epics/tickets** using `atl jira search "project = <PROJECT> AND text ~ 'keywords'"`
3. **Locate PRs** with `gh pr list --search "keywords" --repo owner/repo`
4. **Review git history** for implementation context using `git log --grep="pattern"`

See `references/glean-search-guide.md` for detailed Glean querying strategies.
See `examples/architectural-decision.md` for a complete walkthrough.

### Code Evolution

"How did feature X evolve over time?"

1. **Trace file history** with `git log --follow -p -- <file>`
2. **Find related PRs** using `gh pr list --search "feature-name"`
3. **Search Glean** for discussions using feature name keywords
4. **Check Jira** for feature requests: `atl jira search "project = FX AND summary ~ 'feature'"`

See `references/github-git-analysis.md` for git history techniques.
See `examples/code-evolution.md` for a complete example.

### Process Understanding

"How do I get an order to state X?" or "What triggers workflow Y?"

1. **Search Glean** for process documentation using keywords like "order lifecycle", "state machine"
2. **Find relevant code** using Grep for state transitions, workflow definitions
3. **Check Confluence** using `atl confluence search "order process"` for diagrams and specs
4. **Locate test fixtures** that demonstrate the process

See `references/atlassian-cli-guide.md` for atl CLI patterns.
See `examples/process-understanding.md` for a workflow investigation example.

### Multi-System Interactions

"How does system A interact with system B?"

1. **Search Glean** for integration documentation
2. **Find API contracts** in code using Grep for client/service definitions
3. **Check Confluence** for architecture diagrams: `atl confluence search "architecture"`
4. **Review recent PRs** affecting both systems using `gh pr list --search "systemA systemB"`

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Glean Search

Use Glean MCP for internal information:

```
Query: "order management migration decision"
Datasources: ["confluence", "slack", "gdrive"]
```

**Effective queries:**
- Be specific: "feature flag eppo provider" not just "feature flags"
- Include context: "liberty authentication refactor" not just "authentication"
- Try variations: "DM rails seeders", "delivery management backfills"

See `references/glean-search-guide.md` for complete search strategies.

### Atlassian CLI

**Search Jira tickets:**
```bash
atl jira search "project = FX AND text ~ 'delivery tracking'"
atl jira issue view FX-4623
```

**Search Confluence:**
```bash
atl confluence search "order state machine"
atl confluence page view 12345678
```

See `references/atlassian-cli-guide.md` for full command reference and examples.

### GitHub CLI

**Search PRs:**
```bash
gh pr list --repo ezcater/ez-rails --search "authentication" --limit 20
gh pr view 1234 --repo ezcater/ez-rails --json title,body,comments
```

**Search issues:**
```bash
gh issue list --repo ezcater/delivery-management-rails --search "seeder"
```

### Git History

**File evolution:**
```bash
git log --follow -p -- path/to/file.rb
git blame path/to/file.rb
```

**Commit searches:**
```bash
git log --grep="feature flag"
git log --all --grep="migration"
```

See `references/github-git-analysis.md` for advanced git techniques.

## Information Synthesis

After gathering information from multiple sources:

1. **Create timeline** - Order findings chronologically to show evolution
2. **Identify stakeholders** - Note who made decisions and why
3. **Understand business context** - Connect technical decisions to business needs
4. **Recognize trade-offs** - Explain what was gained and what was sacrificed
5. **Cross-reference sources** - Confirm findings across Glean, Jira, GitHub, git

See `references/synthesis-reporting.md` for detailed synthesis techniques.

## Response Format

Structure research findings clearly:

**Executive Summary**: Direct answer (2-3 sentences)

**Key Findings**:
- Finding 1 with evidence
- Finding 2 with evidence
- Finding 3 with evidence

**Historical Context** (if relevant):
- Timeline of decisions and changes
- Stakeholders involved
- Business drivers

**References**:
- Jira: FX-1234
- PR: ezcater/ez-rails#5678
- Commit: abc123def
- Confluence: [Title](page-id)

## Quality Standards

- **Be specific**: Include ticket numbers, PR links, commit SHAs, dates
- **Cite sources**: Always reference where information was found
- **Acknowledge gaps**: State explicitly what couldn't be found
- **Distinguish facts from speculation**: Make clear what's confirmed vs. inferred
- **Anticipate follow-ups**: Address obvious related questions

## Common Research Scenarios

### Finding Original Implementation

1. Use `gh pr list --search "initial [feature]"` to find first PR
2. Check PR description for original requirements
3. Find linked Jira ticket for business context
4. Review commit messages for implementation decisions

### Understanding Recent Changes

1. Use `git log --since="1 month ago" --grep="[feature]"`
2. Check recent PRs with `gh pr list --search "is:merged [feature]"`
3. Search Glean for Slack discussions in recent timeframe
4. Check Jira for recent bugs or improvements

### Investigating Production Issues

1. Search Jira for related tickets: `atl jira search "project = FX AND text ~ 'error'"`
2. Find relevant code with Grep
3. Check git blame for recent changes
4. Search Glean for related incidents or postmortems

## Special Considerations

### EngPortal Documentation

EngPortal content comes from GitHub files:
- URL: `https://engportal.ezcater.com/docs/.../component/repo-name/path`
- Source: `https://github.com/ezcater/repo-name/blob/main/path.md`

Access via:
- Read file directly if repo checked out under `/Users/doughughes/code/ezcater`
- Ask Glean for engportal content
- Use `gh` CLI to read from GitHub

### Checked Out Repositories

If repository exists under `/Users/doughughes/code/ezcater`:
- Read files directly with Read tool
- Run git commands in repository directory
- Use grep/glob for code searches

### Multiple Projects

ezCater has many interconnected projects:
- ez-rails: Main monolith
- delivery-management-rails: Delivery tracking
- omnichannel-rails: Multi-channel features
- liberty: Mobile app backend

When researching cross-project features, check all relevant repositories.

## When to Escalate to Deep Research Agent

Use the deep research agent (by saying "do deep research" or "deep research needed") when:
- Investigation requires synthesizing 5+ sources
- Need comprehensive historical timeline
- Architectural decision investigation spanning multiple systems
- Research involves connecting dots across quarters/years
- Question requires extensive Opus-level reasoning

For straightforward searches, PR lookups, or single-system investigations, this skill provides efficient guidance without the overhead of the autonomous agent.
