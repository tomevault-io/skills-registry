# Create Dapr Workflow .NET Application

## Overview

This skill describes how to create a Dapr Workflow application using .NET.

## Execution Order

You MUST follow these phases in strict order:
1. **Check specification** - Check if the user specified what needs to be built.
2. **Project Setup** — Create all files and folders.
3. **Verify** — Verify that the project builds.
4. **Create README.md** — Create a readme that summarizes what is built and how to run & test the application. Do not provide instructions at the end of this phase.
5. **Show final message** - Your LAST output MUST be EXACTLY the message defined in the `## Show final message` section. Do NOT add any other text, summary, or commentary after it.

## Prerequisites

The following must be installed by the user before this skill can run:

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
- [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/)

Additional runtime dependencies (handled during project setup):

- NuGet package: `Dapr.Workflow` version `1.17.8`
- NuGet package: `Dapr.Workflow.Versioning` version `1.17.8`
- Start the [Diagrid Dev Dashboard](https://www.diagrid.io/blog/improving-the-local-dapr-workflow-experience-diagrid-dashboard): `docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/diagridio/diagrid-dashboard:latest`

## Check specification

If you don't have enough context what to build, ask the user the following clarifying questions one by one using an interview style:

1. What is the purpose of the workflow application?
2. Describe how workflow should work. Which patterns should be used?
3. Specify the input and output objects of the workflow.
4. What's the name of this project? This will be used as the folder name and solution name. Don't use any spaces in this name.


## Project Setup

Create the project root folder inside the current location where the terminal is open, then create a new ASP.NET Core web application inside it:

```shell
mkdir <ProjectRoot>
cd <ProjectRoot>
dotnet new web -n <ProjectName>
dotnet add <ProjectName> package Dapr.Workflow --version 1.17.8
dotnet add <ProjectName> package Dapr.Workflow.Versioning --version 1.17.8
```

The <ProjectName> should start with the <ProjectRoot> and end with `App`: <ProjectRoot>App.

### Folder structure

```
<ProjectRoot>/
├── .gitignore
├── dapr.yaml
├── local.http
├── resources/
│   └── statestore.yaml
└── <ProjectName>/
    ├── <ProjectName>.csproj
    ├── Program.cs
    ├── Properties/
    │   └── launchSettings.json
    ├── Models/
    │   └── <ModelName>.cs
    ├── Workflows/
    │   └── <WorkflowName>.cs
    └── Activities/
        └── <ActivityName>.cs
```

### .gitignore

Visual Studio style `.gitignore` file in the project root. Ignores build output (`bin`, `obj`), debug/release folders, and other common .NET artifacts. See `REFERENCE.md` for full example.

### dapr.yaml

Multi-app run file in the project root. Configures the Dapr sidecar and points to the resources folder. See `REFERENCE.md` for full example and key points.

### resources/statestore.yaml

Dapr Workflow requires a state store component (with `actorStateStore` set to `"true"`). See `REFERENCE.md` for full example and key points.

### Properties/launchSettings.json

Configures the application port, which must match `appPort` in `dapr.yaml`. See `REFERENCE.md` for full example.

### .csproj

Standard ASP.NET Core web project targeting `net10.0` with the `Dapr.Workflow` and `Dapr.Workflow.Versioning` packages. See `REFERENCE.md` for full example.

### Models

Record types for workflow and activity input/output, placed in a `Models` folder. Must be serializable since Dapr persists workflow state. See `REFERENCE.md` for full example and key points.

### Program.cs

Uses `AddDaprWorkflow` to register workflow and activity types. Uses `DaprWorkflowClient` to schedule workflow instances and query status via HTTP endpoints. See `REFERENCE.md` for full example and key points.

### Workflow Class

Inherits from `Workflow<TInput, TOutput>`, overrides `RunAsync`, and orchestrates activities via `context.CallActivityAsync`. Must be `internal sealed`. Place in a `Workflows` folder/namespace. See `REFERENCE.md` for full example, key points, determinism rules, and workflow patterns (chaining, fan-out/fan-in, sub-workflows).

### Activity Class

Inherits from `WorkflowActivity<TInput, TOutput>`, overrides `RunAsync`, and contains the actual business logic. Must be `internal sealed`. Place in an `Activities` folder/namespace. See `REFERENCE.md` for full example and key points.

### local.http

HTTP request file for testing the workflow endpoints. Contains a `start` request (POST) to schedule a new workflow instance and a `status` request (GET) to query the workflow state. Uses the `<app-port>` from `launchSettings.json`. See `REFERENCE.md` for full example.

## Verify

**IMPORTANT: After Project Setup you MUST show these exact verification instructions:**

1. Run `dotnet build` on the csproj file to check for build errors.
2. Instruct the user to start the application with `dapr run -f .` in the project root to start the workflow app.

## Create README.md

**IMPORTANT: After Verify you MUST run these instructions:**

Create a README.md file inside the <ProjectRoot> folder.

The README contains the following sections:
1. Summary of what this folder contains.
2. Architecture description that explains the technology stack and prerequisites to run it locally. **DO NOT suggest to run Redis separately since it's part of the Dapr installation and is running in a container already.**
3. A mermaid diagram that explains the workflow.
4. How to start the application using the Dapr CLI.
5. List the available endpoints in the Program.cs file and provide examples how to call these using curl. Also include a link to the `local.http` file.
6. How to inspect the workflow execution using the Diagrid Dev Dashboard.
7. How to run the application with Diagrid Catalyst to visually inspect the workflow.

See `REFERENCE.md` for additional instructions on running locally and running with Catalyst.

## Show final message

**IMPORTANT: This is the LAST step. After Create README.md, your final output MUST be ONLY the message below — no preamble, no summary, no additional commentary, only replace the <ProjectRoot> with the actual value:**

The <ProjectRoot> workflow application is created. Open the README.md file in the <ProjectRoot> folder for a summary and instructions for running locally.
