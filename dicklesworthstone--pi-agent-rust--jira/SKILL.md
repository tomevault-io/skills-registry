# Jira Skill

Interactive Jira command line tool for managing issues, epics, sprints, and more.

## Setup

### Installation

Install `jira-cli`:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install jira-cli

# Or download from releases
# https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli/releases
```

### Configuration

1. Get a Jira API token for Jira Cloud: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Export the token:

```bash
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
```

Add to your shell config (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to make it persistent.

3. Initialize jira-cli:

```bash
jira init
```

Follow the prompts to configure:
- Installation type (Cloud or Local)
- Base URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`)
- Email/username
- Project key (optional, can be set per command)

For on-premise installations, you may need to set:

```bash
export JIRA_AUTH_TYPE="bearer"  # or "basic"
```

## List Issues

```bash
# List recent issues (interactive)
jira issue list

# List issues created in last 7 days

- Time format: `1h` (hour), `1d` (day), `1w` (week), `1m` (month)
- Date filters: `-7d` (7 days ago), `month` (this month), `week` (this week)
- Always use quotes around status names with spaces: `-s "In Progress"`
