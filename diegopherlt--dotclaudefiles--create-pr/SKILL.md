Create a pull request text on a file named `<current-branch>-PR.md` on English language
following one of the formats defined in [formats](./formats)

Create the file at the root of the CWD.

## Posible formats

- [standard](./formats/standard.md): When none of the other formats apply.
  
If in doubt between two or more formats and standard is not included, ask the user for clarification.

**Temporal note**: More formats will be added in the future, just use standard for now.

## Guidelines

- Be concise, fulfill the information on formats with the minimal required information.
  - If the reader of it needs more context, let them ask for it, so do not bloat the file.
- Use markdown syntax.
- Be aware of the dimension of the changes done.
  - A small fix or feature should not have a very big PR description.
  - A big refactor or feature should have a more detailed PR description.

## How to measure size the changes

- Small: 1-4 files changed, up to 150 lines changed.
  - PR sections will likely have one to two sentences.
- Medium: 5-7 files changed, 150-700 lines changed.
  - Try to explain the reasoning behind the changes.
  - PR sections will likely have up to 3 paragraphs.
- Large: 8+ files changed, 700+ lines changed.
  - PR sections will likely have up to 5 paragraphs.
  - There is a high chance that there are going to be multiple elements involved, explain how they interconnect.
  - Focus on a explaining the high level details of the changes

The assistant have the proper criteria and judgment to determine the dimension of changes
done outside of the quantitative metrics provided; appeal the quantitative metrics as a guideline, not a rule.
