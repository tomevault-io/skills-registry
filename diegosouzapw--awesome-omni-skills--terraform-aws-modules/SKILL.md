description: modules/vpc/variables.tf workflow skill. Use this skill when the user needs Terraform module creation for AWS \u2014 reusable modules, state management, and HCL best practices. Use when building or reviewing Terraform AWS infrastructure and the operator should preserve the upstream workflow, copied support files, and provenance before merging or handing off. Use when this capability is needed.

# modules/vpc/variables.tf

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/terraform-aws-modules` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

You are an expert in Terraform for AWS specializing in reusable module design, state management, and production-grade HCL patterns.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Creating reusable Terraform modules for AWS resources
- Reviewing Terraform code for best practices and security
- Designing remote state and workspace strategies
- Migrating from CloudFormation or manual setup to Terraform
- The user needs AWS CDK or CloudFormation, not Terraform
- The infrastructure is on a non-AWS provider

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Structure modules with clear variables.tf, outputs.tf, main.tf, and versions.tf.
2. Pin provider and module versions to avoid breaking changes.
3. Use remote state (S3 + DynamoDB locking) for team environments.
4. Apply terraform fmt and terraform validate before commits.
5. Use for_each over count for resources that need stable identity.
6. Tag all resources consistently using a default_tags block in the provider.
7. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

1. Structure modules with clear `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `main.tf`, and `versions.tf`.
2. Pin provider and module versions to avoid breaking changes.
3. Use remote state (S3 + DynamoDB locking) for team environments.
4. Apply `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` before commits.
5. Use `for_each` over `count` for resources that need stable identity.
6. Tag all resources consistently using a `default_tags` block in the provider.

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @terraform-aws-modules to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @terraform-aws-modules against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @terraform-aws-modules for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @terraform-aws-modules using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: Reusable VPC Module

```hcl
# modules/vpc/variables.tf
variable "name" { type = string }
variable "cidr" { type = string, default = "10.0.0.0/16" }
variable "azs" { type = list(string) }

# modules/vpc/main.tf
resource "aws_vpc" "this" {
  cidr_block           = var.cidr
  enable_dns_support   = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  tags = { Name = var.name }
}

# modules/vpc/outputs.tf
output "vpc_id" { value = aws_vpc.this.id }
```

### Example 2: Remote State Backend

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-tf-state"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "tf-lock"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- ✅ Do: Pin provider versions in versions.tf
- ✅ Do: Use terraform plan output in PR reviews
- ✅ Do: Store state in S3 with DynamoDB locking and encryption
- ❌ Don't: Use count when resource identity matters — use for_each
- ❌ Don't: Commit .tfstate files to version control
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/terraform-aws-modules`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Troubleshooting

**Problem:** State lock not released after a failed apply
**Solution:** Run `terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>` after confirming no other operations are running.
