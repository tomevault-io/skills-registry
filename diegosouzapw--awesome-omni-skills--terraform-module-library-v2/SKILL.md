# Terraform Module Library

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/terraform-module-library` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Terraform Module Library Production-ready Terraform module patterns for AWS, Azure, and GCP infrastructure.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Purpose, Module Structure, Standard Module Pattern, Module Composition, Testing, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- The task is unrelated to terraform module library
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope
- Build reusable infrastructure components
- Standardize cloud resource provisioning
- Implement infrastructure as code best practices
- Create multi-cloud compatible modules

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `references/aws-modules.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `references/aws-modules.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
2. Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
3. Provide actionable steps and verification.
4. If detailed examples are required, open resources/implementation-playbook.md.
5. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
6. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
7. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

#### Imported: Purpose

Create reusable, well-tested Terraform modules for common cloud infrastructure patterns across multiple cloud providers.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @terraform-module-library-v2 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @terraform-module-library-v2 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @terraform-module-library-v2 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @terraform-module-library-v2 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: AWS VPC Module Example

**main.tf:**
```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = var.cidr_block
  enable_dns_hostnames = var.enable_dns_hostnames
  enable_dns_support   = var.enable_dns_support

  tags = merge(
    {
      Name = var.name
    },
    var.tags
  )
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  count             = length(var.private_subnet_cidrs)
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block        = var.private_subnet_cidrs[count.index]
  availability_zone = var.availability_zones[count.index]

  tags = merge(
    {
      Name = "${var.name}-private-${count.index + 1}"
      Tier = "private"
    },
    var.tags
  )
}

resource "aws_internet_gateway" "main" {
  count  = var.create_internet_gateway ? 1 : 0
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  tags = merge(
    {
      Name = "${var.name}-igw"
    },
    var.tags
  )
}
```

**variables.tf:**
```hcl
variable "name" {
  description = "Name of the VPC"
  type        = string
}

variable "cidr_block" {
  description = "CIDR block for VPC"
  type        = string
  validation {
    condition     = can(regex("^([0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}/[0-9]{1,2}$", var.cidr_block))
    error_message = "CIDR block must be valid IPv4 CIDR notation."
  }
}

variable "availability_zones" {
  description = "List of availability zones"
  type        = list(string)
}

variable "private_subnet_cidrs" {
  description = "CIDR blocks for private subnets"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = []
}

variable "enable_dns_hostnames" {
  description = "Enable DNS hostnames in VPC"
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}

variable "tags" {
  description = "Additional tags"
  type        = map(string)
  default     = {}
}
```

**outputs.tf:**
```hcl
output "vpc_id" {
  description = "ID of the VPC"
  value       = aws_vpc.main.id
}

output "private_subnet_ids" {
  description = "IDs of private subnets"
  value       = aws_subnet.private[*].id
}

output "vpc_cidr_block" {
  description = "CIDR block of VPC"
  value       = aws_vpc.main.cidr_block
}
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Use semantic versioning for modules
- Document all variables with descriptions
- Provide examples in examples/ directory
- Use validation blocks for input validation
- Output important attributes for module composition
- Pin provider versions in versions.tf
- Use locals for computed values

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/terraform-module-library`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
