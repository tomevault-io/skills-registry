# Terraform Skill for Claude

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/terraform-skill` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Terraform Skill for Claude Comprehensive Terraform and OpenTofu guidance covering testing, modules, CI/CD, and production patterns. Based on terraform-best-practices.com and enterprise experience.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Testing Strategy Framework, Code Structure Standards, Locals for Dependency Management, Module Development, CI/CD Integration, Security & Compliance.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Creating new Terraform or OpenTofu configurations or modules
- Setting up testing infrastructure for IaC code
- Deciding between testing approaches (validate, plan, frameworks)
- Structuring multi-environment deployments
- Implementing CI/CD for infrastructure-as-code
- Reviewing or refactoring existing Terraform/OpenTofu projects

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Testing Pyramid for Infrastructure

```
        /\
       /  \          End-to-End Tests (Expensive)
      /____\         - Full environment deployment
     /      \        - Production-like setup
    /________\
   /          \      Integration Tests (Moderate)
  /____________\     - Module testing in isolation
 /              \    - Real resources in test account
/________________\   Static Analysis (Cheap)
                     - validate, fmt, lint
                     - Security scanning
```

### Native Test Best Practices (1.6+)

**Before generating test code:**

1. **Validate schemas with Terraform MCP:**
   ```
   Search provider docs → Get resource schema → Identify block types
   ```

2. **Choose correct command mode:**
   - `command = plan` - Fast, for input validation
   - `command = apply` - Required for computed values and set-type blocks

3. **Handle set-type blocks correctly:**
   - Cannot index with `[0]`
   - Use `for` expressions to iterate
   - Or use `command = apply` to materialize

**Common patterns:**
- S3 encryption rules: **set** (use for expressions)
- Lifecycle transitions: **set** (use for expressions)
- IAM policy statements: **set** (use for expressions)

**For detailed testing guides, see:**
- **Testing Frameworks Guide** - Deep dive into static analysis, native tests, and Terratest
- **Quick Reference** - Decision flowchart and command cheat sheet

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @terraform-skill to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @terraform-skill against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @terraform-skill for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @terraform-skill using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Type - When to Use - Scope
- Resource Module - Single logical group of connected resources - VPC + subnets, Security group + rules
- Infrastructure Module - Collection of resource modules for a purpose - Multiple resource modules in one region/account
- Composition - Complete infrastructure - Spans multiple regions/accounts
- Separate environments (prod, staging) from modules (reusable components)
- Use examples/ as both documentation and integration test fixtures
- Keep modules small and focused (single responsibility)

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Core Principles

### 1. Code Structure Philosophy

**Module Hierarchy:**

| Type | When to Use | Scope |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Resource Module** | Single logical group of connected resources | VPC + subnets, Security group + rules |
| **Infrastructure Module** | Collection of resource modules for a purpose | Multiple resource modules in one region/account |
| **Composition** | Complete infrastructure | Spans multiple regions/accounts |

**Hierarchy:** Resource → Resource Module → Infrastructure Module → Composition

**Directory Structure:**
```
environments/        # Environment-specific configurations
├── prod/
├── staging/
└── dev/

modules/            # Reusable modules
├── networking/
├── compute/
└── data/

examples/           # Module usage examples (also serve as tests)
├── complete/
└── minimal/
```

**Key principle from terraform-best-practices.com:**
- Separate **environments** (prod, staging) from **modules** (reusable components)
- Use **examples/** as both documentation and integration test fixtures
- Keep modules small and focused (single responsibility)

**For detailed module architecture, see:** Code Patterns: Module Types & Hierarchy

### 2. Naming Conventions

**Resources:**
```hcl
# Good: Descriptive, contextual
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" { }
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "application_logs" { }

# Good: "this" for singleton resources (only one of that type)
resource "aws_vpc" "this" { }
resource "aws_security_group" "this" { }

# Avoid: Generic names for non-singletons
resource "aws_instance" "main" { }
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" { }
```

**Singleton Resources:**

Use `"this"` when your module creates only one resource of that type:

✅ DO:
```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "this" {}           # Module creates one VPC
resource "aws_security_group" "this" {}  # Module creates one SG
```

❌ DON'T use "this" for multiple resources:
```hcl
resource "aws_subnet" "this" {}  # If creating multiple subnets
```

Use descriptive names when creating multiple resources of the same type.

**Variables:**
```hcl
# Prefix with context when needed
var.vpc_cidr_block          # Not just "cidr"
var.database_instance_class # Not just "instance_class"
```

**Files:**
- `main.tf` - Primary resources
- `variables.tf` - Input variables
- `outputs.tf` - Output values
- `versions.tf` - Provider versions
- `data.tf` - Data sources (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/terraform-skill`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.



## Related Skills

- `@00-andruia-consultant` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.
- `@00-andruia-consultant-v2` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.
- `@10-andruia-skill-smith` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.
- `@10-andruia-skill-smith-v2` - Use when the work is better handled by that native specialization after this imported skill establishes context.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |



### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Code Structure Standards

### Resource Block Ordering

**Strict ordering for consistency:**
1. `count` or `for_each` FIRST (blank line after)
2. Other arguments
3. `tags` as last real argument
4. `depends_on` after tags (if needed)
5. `lifecycle` at the very end (if needed)

```hcl
# ✅ GOOD - Correct ordering
resource "aws_nat_gateway" "this" {
  count = var.create_nat_gateway ? 1 : 0

  allocation_id = aws_eip.this[0].id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public[0].id

  tags = {
    Name = "${var.name}-nat"
  }

  depends_on = [aws_internet_gateway.this]

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

### Variable Block Ordering

1. `description` (ALWAYS required)
2. `type`
3. `default`
4. `validation`
5. `nullable` (when setting to false)

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name for resource tagging"
  type        = string
  default     = "dev"

  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "staging", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be one of: dev, staging, prod."
  }

  nullable = false
}
```

**For complete structure guidelines, see:** Code Patterns: Block Ordering & Structure

#### Imported: Locals for Dependency Management

**Use locals to ensure correct resource deletion order:**

```hcl
# Problem: Subnets might be deleted after CIDR blocks, causing errors
# Solution: Use try() in locals to hint deletion order

locals {
  # References secondary CIDR first, falling back to VPC
  # Forces Terraform to delete subnets before CIDR association
  vpc_id = try(
    aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.this[0].vpc_id,
    aws_vpc.this.id,
    ""
  )
}

resource "aws_vpc" "this" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association" "this" {
  count = var.add_secondary_cidr ? 1 : 0

  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.this.id
  cidr_block = "10.1.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  vpc_id     = local.vpc_id  # Uses local, not direct reference
  cidr_block = "10.1.0.0/24"
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents deletion errors when destroying infrastructure
- Ensures correct dependency order without explicit `depends_on`
- Particularly useful for VPC configurations with secondary CIDR blocks

**For detailed examples, see:** Code Patterns: Locals for Dependency Management

#### Imported: Module Development

### Standard Module Structure

```
my-module/
├── README.md           # Usage documentation
├── main.tf             # Primary resources
├── variables.tf        # Input variables with descriptions

    └── module_test.tftest.hcl  # Or .go
```

### Best Practices Summary

**Variables:**
- ✅ Always include `description`
- ✅ Use explicit `type` constraints
- ✅ Provide sensible `default` values where appropriate
- ✅ Add `validation` blocks for complex constraints
- ✅ Use `sensitive = true` for secrets

**Outputs:**
- ✅ Always include `description`
- ✅ Mark sensitive outputs with `sensitive = true`
- ✅ Consider returning objects for related values
- ✅ Document what consumers should do with each output

#### Imported: CI/CD Integration

### Recommended Workflow Stages

1. **Validate** - Format check + syntax validation + linting
2. **Test** - Run automated tests (native or Terratest)
3. **Plan** - Generate and review execution plan
4. **Apply** - Execute changes (with approvals for production)

### Cost Optimization Strategy

1. **Use mocking for PR validation** (free)
2. **Run integration tests only on main branch** (controlled cost)
3. **Implement auto-cleanup** (prevent orphaned resources)
4. **Tag all test resources** (track spending)

**For complete CI/CD templates, see:**
- **CI/CD Workflows Guide** - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Atlantis integration, cost optimization
- **Quick Reference** - Common CI/CD issues and solutions

#### Imported: Security & Compliance

### Essential Security Checks

```bash
# Static security scanning
trivy config .
checkov -d .
```

### Common Issues to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Store secrets in variables
- Use default VPC
- Skip encryption
- Open security groups to 0.0.0.0/0

✅ **Do:**
- Use AWS Secrets Manager / Parameter Store
- Create dedicated VPCs
- Enable encryption at rest
- Use least-privilege security groups

**For detailed security guidance, see:**
- **Security & Compliance Guide** - Trivy/Checkov integration, secrets management, state file security, compliance testing

#### Imported: Version Management

### Version Constraint Syntax

```hcl
version = "5.0.0"      # Exact (avoid - inflexible)
version = "~> 5.0"     # Recommended: 5.0.x only
version = ">= 5.0"     # Minimum (risky - breaking changes)
```

### Strategy by Component

| Component | Strategy | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Terraform** | Pin minor version | `required_version = "~> 1.9"` |
| **Providers** | Pin major version | `version = "~> 5.0"` |
| **Modules (prod)** | Pin exact version | `version = "5.1.2"` |
| **Modules (dev)** | Allow patch updates | `version = "~> 5.1"` |

### Update Workflow

```bash
# Lock versions initially
terraform init              # Creates .terraform.lock.hcl

# Update to latest within constraints
terraform init -upgrade     # Updates providers

# Review and test
terraform plan
```

**For detailed version management, see:** Code Patterns: Version Management

#### Imported: Modern Terraform Features (1.0+)

### Feature Availability by Version

| Feature | Version | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `try()` function | 0.13+ | Safe fallbacks, replaces `element(concat())` |
| `nullable = false` | 1.1+ | Prevent null values in variables |
| `moved` blocks | 1.1+ | Refactor without destroy/recreate |
| `optional()` with defaults | 1.3+ | Optional object attributes |
| Native testing | 1.6+ | Built-in test framework |
| Mock providers | 1.7+ | Cost-free unit testing |
| Provider functions | 1.8+ | Provider-specific data transformation |
| Cross-variable validation | 1.9+ | Validate relationships between variables |
| Write-only arguments | 1.11+ | Secrets never stored in state |

### Quick Examples

```hcl
# try() - Safe fallbacks (0.13+)
output "sg_id" {
  value = try(aws_security_group.this[0].id, "")
}

# optional() - Optional attributes with defaults (1.3+)
variable "config" {
  type = object({
    name    = string
    timeout = optional(number, 300)  # Default: 300
  })
}

# Cross-variable validation (1.9+)
variable "environment" { type = string }
variable "backup_days" {
  type = number
  validation {
    condition     = var.environment == "prod" ? var.backup_days >= 7 : true
    error_message = "Production requires backup_days >= 7"
  }
}
```
