# Building Scalable Backend Services

Comprehensive backend engineering skill covering API design, database schema engineering, microservices architecture, CQRS/event-sourcing, authentication, caching, performance optimization, and MCP server development.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing REST, GraphQL, or gRPC APIs for new services
- Engineering database schemas for relational (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases
- Architecting microservices with clear boundaries and inter-service communication
- Implementing authentication (JWT, OAuth2) and authorization (RBAC, ABAC)
- Setting up message queues for asynchronous processing
- Implementing caching layers and optimizing performance
- Implementing CQRS, event sourcing, and saga orchestration
- Building MCP servers in Python and TypeScript
- Scaffolding Fastify+tRPC or FastAPI backends

## When Invoked Without Clear Intent

**MANDATORY**: You MUST call the `AskUserQuestion` tool — do NOT render these options as text:

AskUserQuestion(
  header: "Backend",
  question: "What backend engineering topic do you need help with?",
  options: [
    { label: "API Design", description: "REST, GraphQL, gRPC, pagination, error handling" },
    { label: "Database Engineering", description: "PostgreSQL/MongoDB schemas, indexes, migrations" },
    { label: "Auth & Security", description: "JWT, OAuth2, RBAC, rate limiting, input validation" },
    { label: "Microservices", description: "Service boundaries, DDD, circuit breaker, message queues" }
  ]
)

If the user selects "Other", present: Caching & Performance, CQRS / Event Sourcing, MCP Server Development, Framework Patterns, Geospatial / Location Services.

## Reference Routing

> **CONTEXT GUARD**: Load reference files only when the user's request matches a specific topic below. Do NOT load all references upfront.

| User Intent | Reference File |
|---|---|
| REST API design, GraphQL schemas, gRPC services, pagination, error responses | `references/api-patterns.md` |
| PostgreSQL schemas, MongoDB document design, indexes, triggers, migrations | `references/database-patterns.md` |
| JWT auth, refresh tokens, RBAC, rate limiting, input validation, file uploads, secrets management | `references/auth-patterns.md` |
| Redis caching, cache invalidation, N+1 fixes, query optimization, async I/O, connection pooling | `references/caching-performance.md` |
| Service boundaries, DDD, circuit breaker, retry, message queues, event-driven architecture | `references/microservices-patterns.md` |
| CQRS, event sourcing, saga orchestration, choreography, compensating transactions | `references/cqrs-patterns.md` |
| MCP server development, Python MCP, TypeScript MCP, tool definitions | `references/mcp-server-patterns.md` |
| Fastify+tRPC, Express, Go backend, Rust streaming, FastAPI, Django, Python 3.12+ | `references/framework-patterns.md` |
| Amazon Location Service, maps, geocoding, routing, places search, geofencing | `references/geospatial-patterns.md` |

## Visual Diagramming with Excalidraw

Use the Excalidraw MCP server to generate interactive architecture diagrams, database ERDs, auth flows, and message queue topology maps. Describe what you need in natural language.
