# Driving Sales & Business Development

Comprehensive sales skill covering proposals, RFP responses, lead qualification, competitive intelligence, pricing, pipeline management, and stakeholder engagement.

## When to Use This Skill

- Drafting proposals and statements of work
- Responding to RFPs with structured submissions
- Researching and qualifying leads for outreach
- Building competitive intelligence and battle cards
- Creating pricing models and generating quotes
- Managing deal pipeline stages and forecasting
- Crafting outreach sequences and engagement plans
- Building business cases and market opportunity assessments

## When Invoked Without Clear Intent

**MANDATORY**: You MUST call the `AskUserQuestion` tool — do NOT render these options as text:

AskUserQuestion(
  header: "Sales",
  question: "What sales or business development task do you need help with?",
  options: [
    { label: "Proposals & RFPs", description: "Proposals, statements of work, RFP responses, compliance matrices" },
    { label: "Lead Research", description: "ICP definition, lead scoring, competitive analysis, battle cards" },
    { label: "Pricing & Pipeline", description: "Pricing models, quote generation, deal pipeline, outreach" },
    { label: "Content & Automation", description: "Sales automation, content marketing, business cases, market sizing" }
  ]
)

If the user selects "Other", offer: Stakeholder Engagement (buying committee mapping, champion coaching).

## Reference Routing

> **CONTEXT GUARD**: Load reference files only when the user's request matches a specific topic below. Do NOT load all references upfront.

| User Intent | Reference File |

| Lead research, ICP definition, lead scoring, competitive analysis, battle cards | `references/research-qualification.md` |
| Pricing models, quote generation, deal pipeline, pipeline health, outreach sequences | `references/pricing-pipeline.md` |
| Enterprise stakeholder mapping, engagement cadence, champion coaching | `references/stakeholder-engagement.md` |
| Sales automation, content marketing, ad analysis, business cases, market sizing, ROM estimation | `references/automation-content.md` |
