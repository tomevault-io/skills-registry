## What I Do

Track YouTube video performance to discover patterns in what works. This is "poor man's reinforcement learning" - manually logging outcomes to improve over time.

## The RL Loop

```
1. PUBLISH  -> Upload video with hypothesis (thumbnail style, title hook, topic)
2. WAIT     -> Let it run for 48-72 hours
3. LOG      -> Record in Notion with views, CTR, retention
4. ANALYZE  -> Compare winners vs losers
5. REPEAT   -> Apply learnings to next video
```

## Key Insight from First Data Point

**Video 1:** "Using AI agents to pay bills and send invoices"

- 8 views in 1 day
- Plain talking head thumbnail
- Generic title

**Video 2:** "Paying My Contractor Through Claude | AI-Powered Finance"

- 133 views in 5 days (16x better!)
- Thumbnail shows: Face + Product UI overlay + Text "I Let AI Pay My Bills"
- Title has: Specific action + Brand name (Claude) + Category tag

### What Made Video 2 Win:

1. **Thumbnail has TEXT overlay** - "I Let AI Pay My Bills" creates curiosity
2. **Shows the PRODUCT** - UI screenshot proves it's real, not just talk
3. **Face + Context** - Person looking at the UI, not just talking
4. **Specific title** - "Paying My Contractor" > "pay bills" (concrete vs abstract)
5. **Brand name in title** - "Claude" attracts AI-interested audience
6. **Category tag** - "AI-Powered Finance" helps discoverability

### Hypothesis to Test:

> Thumbnails with TEXT + PRODUCT UI + FACE outperform plain talking head thumbnails by 10x+

## Thumbnail Patterns to Test

Based on initial data:

| Pattern          | Example | Hypothesis                                          |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Face + UI + Text | Video 2 | Best performer - proves reality + creates curiosity |
| Face + Bold Text | -       | May work for controversial takes                    |
| UI Only          | -       | Good for tutorials, may lack personality            |
| Talking Head     | Video 1 | Worst - no visual hook                              |
| Before/After     | -       | Good for transformation content                     |

## Title Patterns to Test

| Pattern                 | Example                               | Hypothesis                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Specific Action + Brand | "Paying My Contractor Through Claude" | Winner - concrete + searchable |
| Generic Action          | "Using AI to pay bills"               | Loser - too vague              |
| Question                | "Can AI Really Pay Your Bills?"       | Untested - may drive curiosity |
| Number + Outcome        | "I Automated 5 Hours of Finance Work" | Untested - quantified value    |
