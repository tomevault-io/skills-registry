# Sprint Planner

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Context

Ask the user for:
- **Sprint goal** (one sentence describing the sprint's purpose)
- **Sprint duration** (default: 2 weeks)
- **Team members** (names and roles)

Then fetch current project state:
```
Use Linear MCP: list_issues with status "In Progress" or "Backlog"
```

### Step 2: Analyze Capacity

Based on team size and sprint duration, calculate:
- **Total story points available**: team_size x 10 points per person per sprint
- **Already committed**: sum of in-progress issue points
- **Available capacity**: total - committed

Tell the user: "Your team has ~{available} points of capacity this sprint."

### Step 3: Create Task Breakdown

For each piece of work the user describes:

1. **Title**: Short, action-oriented (e.g., "Add password reset flow")
2. **Description**: What "done" looks like in 2-3 sentences
3. **Estimate**: Story points (1 = few hours, 3 = a day, 5 = 2-3 days, 8 = a week)
4. **Priority**: Urgent / High / Medium / Low
5. **Labels**: Feature, Bug, Tech Debt, or Infrastructure

Present the full list to the user for approval BEFORE creating anything.

### Step 4: Create in Linear

After user approves:
```
For each task, call Linear MCP: create_issue
Parameters:
  - title: from breakdown
  - description: from breakdown
  - estimate: story points
  - priority: mapped to Linear priority (1-4)
  - labels: from breakdown
  - assignee: if user specified
```

Confirm each creation. If any fail, report which ones and why.

### Step 5: Summary

Provide a sprint summary:
- Total tasks created
- Total story points committed
- Capacity remaining
- Any risks (over-committed, unbalanced workload)

## Examples

### Example 1: Small Sprint

User says: "Plan a sprint for our auth improvements"

Actions:
1. Fetch current Linear backlog
2. Ask about team and goals
3. Suggest breakdown: "Add SSO login" (5pts), "Fix session timeout bug" (3pts), "Add rate limiting" (3pts)
4. User approves
5. Create 3 issues in Linear

Result: 3 tasks created, 11 points committed, sprint ready.

### Example 2: Large Feature Breakdown

User says: "Break down the checkout redesign into sprint tasks"

Actions:
1. Ask user to describe the checkout flow changes
2. Break into atomic tasks (no task > 8 points)
3. Suggest ordering by dependency
4. Flag if total exceeds sprint capacity

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Issue creation failed — authentication error"**
Cause: Linear API token expired or missing permissions.
Solution: Ask user to reconnect Linear in Settings > Extensions.

**Error: "Team not found"**
Cause: Team name doesn't match Linear workspace.
Solution: Use `list_teams` via Linear MCP to show available teams.

**Sprint seems overloaded**
If total points > 80% of capacity, warn:
"This sprint is at {percent}% capacity. Consider moving {lowest_priority_task} to the backlog."
