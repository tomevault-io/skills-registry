description: Launch lopen test tui and confirm every TUI component in the gallery renders, previews, and responds with mock data so the UI surfaces match the specification. Use when this capability is needed.

# Prepare the gallery
1. Ensure the host application registers the TUI services (`AddLopenTui()` in the DI graph) so `IComponentGallery` exposes all components and the CLI command can resolve it.
2. Run `lopen test tui --list` once to confirm the command can start, the gallery reports a non-empty component list, and the command exits with code 0. This also verifies the `test` command group and `tui` subcommand wiring described in the CLI research notes.

# Validate every component
1. Execute `lopen test tui` in a writable terminal. The gallery should render a two-pane fullscreen TUI with the left pane showing the selectable list from `GalleryListComponent` and the right pane displaying previews rendered via `IPreviewableComponent.RenderPreview()`.
2. Walk through the list so every component is highlighted at least once. The expected baseline components are: `Top Panel`, `Main Activity Area`, `Context Panel`, `Prompt Area`, `Landing Page`, `Session Resume Modal`, `Confirmation Modal`, `Error Display`, `Diff Viewer`, `File Picker`, `Module Selection Modal`, `Progress & Spinners`, `Tool Call Display`, and `Component Selection UI`. (New additions should register automatically.)
3. For each component:
   - Press Enter to open its preview, verify the stub data exercises multiple states (empty, populated, loading, error) as described in TUI-48, and confirm no real network/LLM/filesystem operations occur.
   - Interact with the preview using the same keyboard shortcuts/spec actions that exist in the live app (scroll, expand/collapse, `Tab`, etc.) to ensure the component stays responsive.
   - Press `Esc`/`q` to return to the gallery list without crashing.
4. Use `lopen test tui <component-name>` to jump straight to a specific component when iterating on fixes. Verify the command succeeds, renders the preview, and returns to the terminal once you exit the preview.

# Non-interactive or CI-friendly checks
1. In automation or headless environments, rely on `lopen test tui --list` to assert the gallery still registers all components (look for the `Component Gallery:` header and each component name in the output). This also catches scenarios where the registry is empty and the command returns exit code 1 with the "Component gallery not available" or "No components registered" messages.
2. Consider piping the output to a log file so you can refer back to the component list when analyzing regressions.

# Troubleshooting hints
- If the interactive run immediately exits, check `Console.IsInputRedirected`; the command falls back to list mode when stdin is unavailable.
- If a component fails to render, make sure it implements the gallery interfaces (`ITuiComponent`, optionally `IPreviewableComponent`, and `IStatefulTuiComponent<T>`) and can accept stub state instead of reaching for live services.
- Use the CLI research file references (TUI-42 through TUI-49) to cross-check the acceptance criteria the gallery is meant to cover.
