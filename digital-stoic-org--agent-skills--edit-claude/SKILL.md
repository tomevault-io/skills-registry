# Instructions for Managing CLAUDE.md Files

## Determine Action Type

**CREATE**: New CLAUDE.md file requested
**UPDATE**: Modify existing CLAUDE.md (keywords: "update", "add", "modify", "change")
**OPTIMIZE**: Improve token efficiency (keywords: "optimize", "reduce tokens", "improve")

## Updating Existing CLAUDE.md Files

1. **Read current file**: Always read before editing
2. **Identify section**: Locate relevant section or create new heading
3. **Make surgical edits**: Use Edit tool for precise changes
4. **Preserve structure**: Maintain existing organization patterns
5. **Validate**: Ensure markdown is valid and clear

## Optimizing CLAUDE.md Files

1. **Audit current content**:
   - Identify verbose prose that can become bullets
   - Find repetitive information
   - Locate outdated or irrelevant content

2. **Apply compression techniques**:
   - Convert paragraphs → bullets or tables
   - Remove unnecessary words and filler
   - Use abbreviations where context is clear
   - Group similar items together

3. **Remove anti-patterns**:
   - Delete sensitive information (credentials, tokens)
   - Remove frequently changing data
   - Extract verbose documentation to separate files
   - Remove duplicate information

4. **Validate token efficiency**: Aim for maximum signal, minimum tokens

See `reference.md` for optimization strategies and examples.

## Creating New CLAUDE.md Files

1. **Gather context**: Ask user for project details if missing:
   - Coding standards (indentation, naming conventions)
   - Build/test/deployment commands
   - Architectural patterns
   - Security requirements

2. **Organize around WHAT/WHY/HOW**:
   - **WHAT**: Tech stack, codebase map, key packages
   - **WHY**: Project purpose, component responsibilities
   - **HOW**: Build/test/deploy commands, verification methods

3. **Determine organization strategy** (memory hierarchy):

   **Main CLAUDE.md** (universal, <200 tokens ideal, <500 acceptable):
   - Build/test/deploy commands
   - Universal code style applying to all files
   - Critical patterns used everywhere
   - Cohesive project-wide conventions (Git, Security, Planning, Style)
   - `CLAUDE.md` in project root (shared via git)

   **.claude/rules/** (modular, 100-300 tokens each):
   - Path/language-specific files (auto-loaded): `python.md`, `javascript.md`
   - Domain-specific patterns: `frontend/`, `backend/`
   - Path-specific rules with frontmatter (see reference.md)

   **CLAUDE.local.md** (personal, auto-gitignored):
   - Personal preferences not shared with team
   - Local dev shortcuts, experimental rules

   **~/.claude/CLAUDE.md** (cross-project personal):
   - Universal personal preferences across all projects

   **@imports** (lazy-loaded reference):
   - External docs: `@README`, `@docs/architecture.md`
   - Home directory: `@~/.claude/my-prefs.md`

   **Memory load order** (later overrides earlier):
   1. Enterprise policy → 2. Project memory → 3. Project rules (.claude/rules/) → 4. User memory (~/.claude/) → 5. Project local (CLAUDE.local.md)

4. **File Zones (if project uses ref/wip pattern)**:
   - Detect folder names: `ref/` or `reference/` (read-only), `wip/` or `work-in-progress/` (workspace). Use whichever name the project already has.
   - Add to CLAUDE.md:
     ```
     ## File Zones
     - 🔒 ref/ (or reference/) — READ-ONLY. Never edit unless user explicitly says "update ref". Show diff and ask first.
     - ✏️ wip/ (or work-in-progress/) — Default workspace. All new files and edits go here.
     - 🔒 .in/ — READ-ONLY archive. Never modify.
     ```
   - Include this section in main CLAUDE.md for all projects using ref/wip (non-technical users especially benefit from visual clarity)

5. **Organization decision tree**:
   - Universal + cohesive (Git/Security/Planning/File Zones)? → Main CLAUDE.md (even if 200-500 tokens)
   - Path/language-specific (Python/JS/Bash rules)? → .claude/rules/lang.md with frontmatter
   - Domain-specific (frontend/backend patterns)? → .claude/rules/domain/
   - Topic >300 tokens standalone? → Consider .claude/rules/topic.md
   - Personal preferences? → CLAUDE.local.md or ~/.claude/
   - Detailed reference docs? → @import external docs

5. **Universal vs Path-Specific Decision**:

   **Keep in main CLAUDE.md:**
   - Universal conventions applying to ALL files/operations
   - Cohesive conceptual units (Git workflow, Security policies, Style guides)
   - Even if combined total is 200-500 tokens
   - Examples: commit format, pre-commit flow, security exclusions, output formatting

   **Extract to .claude/rules/:**
   - Path/language-specific rules (Python for `*.py`, React for `*.tsx`)
   - Domain-specific patterns (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `infra/`)
   - When single topic exceeds ~300 tokens standalone
   - Examples: `python.md` with `paths: "**/*.py"`, `bash-scripting.md` with `paths: "**/*.sh"`

   **Key principle:** Cohesion and semantic grouping matter more than strict token limits. A well-organized 430-token CLAUDE.md with universal sections (Git 90 + Security 50 + Planning 45 + Style 200 = 385 tokens) is better than fragmenting conceptually related content across multiple files.

6. **H1 = Project Name** (required):
   - First line MUST be `# Project Name` — used by `/switch`, `/save-context`, `/load-context` for project identification
   - Examples: `# Praxis`, `# NanoVC — Control Repo`, `# GTD-PCM Control Plane`

7. **Structure content** (token-efficient):
   - Use markdown headings for organization
   - Use tables and bullets over prose
   - Be specific (e.g., "Use 2-space indentation" not "Format code properly")
   - Group related items logically

8. **Include sanity marker** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   sanity check: [random-number]
   ```

9. **Write file** with appropriate sections based on user context

See `reference.md § Templates` for starter examples and `§ Modular Rules` for .claude/rules/ patterns.

## ⚠️ Hard Char Limits (from Claude Code source)

Claude Code enforces **hard character limits** on instruction files. Content beyond these limits is **silently truncated** with `[truncated]` appended — no warning to the user.

| Limit | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Per file** | 4,000 chars | `MAX_INSTRUCTION_FILE_CHARS` |
| **Total across all files** | 12,000 chars | `MAX_TOTAL_INSTRUCTION_CHARS` |

**Loading order**: Files are loaded walking from filesystem root to CWD. Once total budget is exhausted: `"Additional instruction content omitted after reaching the prompt budget."` — deeper files (closer to CWD) are the ones that get dropped.

**Implications**:
- A CLAUDE.md chain of 4 files (e.g., `~/.claude/` → praxis root → repo → subfolder) shares the 12K budget
- Files with **identical content** (after whitespace normalization) are auto-deduped
- Run `claude --dump-system-prompt` to verify what actually loads
- Run `wc -c` on each file in the chain to check headroom

**When creating/updating**: Always check current chain total. Warn user if any file is >3,500 chars or chain total >10,000 chars.

## Key Principles

- **Specific over generic**: "Run `npm test`" not "Test the code"
- **Persistent not temporary**: Coding standards yes, current bug no
- **Concise not verbose**: Bullets and tables over paragraphs
- **Modular organization**: Main CLAUDE.md + .claude/rules/ + @imports
- **Path-specific when needed**: Frontmatter with `paths:` glob patterns
- **Secure**: Never include credentials or sensitive data

## MANDATORY Validation (CREATE only)

**STOP**: Before creating new CLAUDE.md, answer YES/NO for each:

- **Q1: Persistent** (not temporary)? [YES/NO]
- **Q2: Frequently referenced** (coding standards, workflows)? [YES/NO]
- **Q3: Concise** (avoid verbose docs)? [YES/NO]
- **Q4: Non-sensitive** (no credentials/tokens)? [YES/NO]

**If ANY answer is NO:**
→ STOP. Explain why inappropriate.
→ Recommend alternatives: README.md (docs), environment variables (secrets), direct request (one-time), .claude/rules/ (detailed guidelines)
→ EXIT immediately.

**If ALL answers are YES:**
→ Proceed to "Creating New CLAUDE.md Files" section above.

## Progressive Disclosure

Keep main CLAUDE.md lean (<200 tokens). Distribute content:

**Modular rules** (.claude/rules/ - auto-loaded):
```
.claude/rules/
  |- code-style.md
  |- security.md
  |- frontend/react.md
  |- backend/api.md
```

**Imports** (lazy-loaded when referenced):
```markdown
@README
@docs/architecture.md
@~/.claude/my-project-prefs.md
```

**Reference docs** (external):
```
reference/
  |- runbooks/building.md
  |- standards/conventions.md
```

Use `/memory` command during session to view/edit loaded memories.

## Constraints

- **Hard char limits**: 4,000 chars/file, 12,000 chars total chain (see ⚠️ Hard Char Limits above)
- **Instruction budget**: LLMs follow ~150-200 instructions reliably. Claude Code's system prompt uses ~50, leaving ~100 for CLAUDE.md
- **Token target**: Main CLAUDE.md <200 tokens ideal, <500 acceptable for universal cohesive content
- **Universal relevance**: Every line should apply to most sessions, not task-specific work
- **Modular distribution**: Use .claude/rules/ for path/language/domain-specific content, not to fragment universal cohesive sections
- **Cohesion over tokens**: Keep conceptually related universal sections together (Git, Security, Planning, Style) even if combined total is 200-500 tokens

See `reference.md § Content Guidelines` for inclusion/exclusion rules and anti-patterns.
