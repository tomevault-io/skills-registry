# PostgreSQL Business Intelligence Agent

This skill guides the agent in conducting comprehensive business intelligence analysis on a PostgreSQL database. It automatically discovers database metadata, samples data to understand business context, generates business-relevant SQL queries, executes them, and produces deep analytical reports for business operations insights.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this skill is to transform raw database data into actionable business intelligence. It serves as an automated data analyst that:

- **Discovers** database structure and metadata automatically
- **Understands** business context through data sampling
- **Generates** relevant SQL queries for business metrics
- **Executes** queries efficiently and safely
- **Analyzes** results to provide strategic insights
- **Reports** findings with actionable recommendations

## Business Intelligence Framework

The agent uses a multi-dimensional framework covering:

### 1. Business Scale Metrics
- Transaction volumes and values
- Customer base and distribution
- Product/service inventory and categorization

### 2. Growth Trends
- Year-over-year and month-over-month comparisons
- Daily/Monthly active user trends
- Revenue and order trends

### 3. User Behavior Analysis
- User engagement and activity levels
- Retention rates and cohort analysis
- Conversion funnel metrics

### 4. Financial Insights
- Revenue trends and patterns
- Average order value (AOV)
- Payment success rates and refund metrics

### 5. Inventory & Product Analysis
- Inventory turnover rates
- Product performance rankings
- Stock-out and overstock indicators

### 6. Operational Efficiency
- Order processing times
- Customer satisfaction indicators
- System performance metrics

## Workflow

When activated, this skill executes a comprehensive analysis pipeline:

1. **Metadata Discovery** → Scan database structure, tables, columns, relationships
2. **Data Sampling** → Analyze data patterns, value distributions, business context
3. **SQL Generation** → Generate domain-specific business intelligence queries
4. **Query Execution** → Run all queries with proper error handling
5. **Deep Analysis** → Correlate results, identify patterns, calculate insights
6. **Report Generation** → Produce comprehensive business report

## Available Skills

Each skill represents a callable analysis module that returns structured JSON output.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Read-Only Replicas**: Always run queries against read replicas to avoid impacting production
2. **Schedule During Off-Peak**: Run full analyses during low-traffic periods
3. **Sample Large Tables**: Use sampling for initial discovery, full queries for final reports
4. **Monitor Query Performance**: Set appropriate timeouts for complex queries
5. **Data Quality Checks**: Validate data completeness before generating insights
6. **Incremental Processing**: Process recent data incrementally for faster daily reports

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**
   - Ensure user has SELECT access to information_schema and target tables
   - Check pg_hba.conf for connection permissions

2. **Query Timeout**
   - Increase timeout in configuration
   - Add indexes for frequently queried columns
   - Use sampling for large tables

3. **Memory Errors**
   - Reduce sample size
   - Process data in chunks
   - Use database-side aggregations

### Performance Optimization

- Create indexes on commonly filtered/sorted columns
- Use materialized views for complex aggregations
- Partition large tables by date
- Enable query result caching
