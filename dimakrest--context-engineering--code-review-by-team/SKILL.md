# /code-review -- PR Review Team

Coordinates a multi-phase review pipeline: first cleans up the code, then dispatches specialized reviewers for honest, professional, and concise feedback. Focuses on actionable findings -- no nit-picking, no over-engineering suggestions.

## Step 1: Gather PR Changes

Detect the base branch first, then use it consistently for all diffs:

```bash
# Detect the base branch (usually main or master)
BASE=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo "main")

# Ensure base branch is up to date before diffing
git fetch origin "$BASE"

# Get list of changed files (three-dot diff shows only changes introduced by the branch)
git diff "origin/$BASE...HEAD" --name-only

# Get the full diff
git diff "origin/$BASE...HEAD"

# Get commit messages for intent context
git log "origin/$BASE..HEAD" --oneline
```

Use `origin/$BASE` (the detected base branch) in all subsequent git diff and git log commands throughout this skill — not a hardcoded branch name.

**CRITICAL**: Always use three-dot diffs (`origin/$BASE...HEAD`), NOT two-dot (`origin/$BASE HEAD`). Three-dot diffs show only changes introduced by the branch (from the merge-base to HEAD). Two-dot diffs compare branch tips directly, which inflates the review scope when the branch has merged the base into it.

## Step 2: Understand Project Context

Before dispatching agents, gather project context:
- Check for project guidelines: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.editorconfig`, linter configs
- Check for engineering standards docs referenced in CLAUDE.md
- Identify the tech stack from changed file extensions and imports
- Note any project-specific patterns, conventions, or agent definitions

## Step 3: Categorize Changes

Sort changed files into review domains:

- **Backend**: Server-side code (Python, Go, Java, Node.js, etc.) excluding DB migrations and test files
- **Frontend**: Client-side code (TSX, TS, JSX, JS, CSS, SCSS, etc.) excluding test files
- **Tests**: `*test*`, `*spec*` files, test directories
- **Security-sensitive**: auth files, config files, API endpoints, input handling, external URL fetching

Skip domains with no changed files.

## Step 4: Code Cleanup Phase

Before reviewers look at the code, run a cleanup pass to improve code quality. This makes actual changes to the code.

Launch a dedicated agent to run the built-in `/simplify` skill.

```
Agent call:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- prompt:
  "You are running the /simplify skill on PR changes as part of a code review pipeline.

  ## Changed Files
  {list of ALL changed files}

  ## Instructions

  1. Run the /simplify skill using the Skill tool (skill: 'simplify')
  2. Let it analyze and fix the changed code
  3. Report back what changes were made (if any)

  If /simplify makes no changes, report 'No simplification changes needed.'"
```

Wait for this agent to complete before proceeding.

## Step 5: Dispatch Review Agents (in parallel)

Launch ALL relevant review agents simultaneously. Each reviewer works independently on the cleaned-up code.

### Step 5 preamble: Detect Codex plugin (run once)

Before launching reviewers, check whether the Codex plugin (`codex@openai-codex`) is installed. If it is, the Codex Adversarial Reviewer below will be dispatched alongside the others; if not, it is skipped silently and Step 7 will surface a one-line install recommendation.

```bash
CODEX_PLUGIN_DIR=$(find ~/.claude/plugins -type f -path "*/codex/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" 2>/dev/null \
  | head -1 | xargs -I {} dirname {} | xargs -I {} dirname {})

if [ -n "$CODEX_PLUGIN_DIR" ] \
   && [ -f "$CODEX_PLUGIN_DIR/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" ] \
   && [ -f "$CODEX_PLUGIN_DIR/commands/adversarial-review.md" ]; then
  CODEX_AVAILABLE=1
else
  CODEX_AVAILABLE=0
  CODEX_PLUGIN_DIR=""
fi
```

Remember `CODEX_AVAILABLE` and `CODEX_PLUGIN_DIR` for Steps 5, 6, and 7.

### Backend Reviewer (if backend files changed)

```
Agent call:
- subagent_type: "context-engineering:backend-engineer"
- prompt:
  "Review this PR's backend changes. Scope your review to changes introduced by this PR only.

  ## Changed Files
  {list of changed backend files}

  Run `git diff origin/$BASE...HEAD -- <file>` for each file to see the exact changes. Read full files when needed for context.
  Read commit messages (`git log origin/$BASE..HEAD --oneline`) to understand intent.

  ## Output Format

  Report ONLY substantive findings. Skip anything that passes. Do not invent issues.

  For each finding:
  - **[file:line]** -- Description of the issue
  - **Why it matters** -- One sentence on impact
  - **Suggested fix** -- Brief code suggestion if helpful

  Categorize as:
  - **Must Fix**: Bugs, security issues, pattern violations that will cause problems
  - **Should Fix**: Code quality issues, maintainability concerns
  - **Consider**: Optional improvements worth discussing"
```

### Frontend Reviewer (if frontend files changed)

```
Agent call:
- subagent_type: "context-engineering:frontend-engineer"
- prompt:
  "Review this PR's frontend changes. Scope your review to changes introduced by this PR only.

  ## Changed Files
  {list of changed frontend files}

  Run `git diff origin/$BASE...HEAD -- <file>` for each file to see the exact changes. Read full files when needed for context.
  Read commit messages (`git log origin/$BASE..HEAD --oneline`) to understand intent.

  ## Output Format

  Report ONLY substantive findings. Skip anything that passes. Do not invent issues.

  For each finding:
  - **[file:line]** -- Description of the issue
  - **Why it matters** -- One sentence on impact
  - **Suggested fix** -- Brief code suggestion if helpful

  Categorize as:
  - **Must Fix**: Bugs, accessibility issues, design system violations
  - **Should Fix**: Code quality, missing shared component usage, type issues
  - **Consider**: Optional improvements worth discussing"
```

### QA Reviewer (if any test files changed OR if non-test code changed without corresponding tests)

```
Agent call:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- prompt:
  "You are a QA engineer reviewing test coverage for a PR.

  ## Your Review Mindset

  Think like a QA engineer who cares about testability:
  - Are the right things being tested?
  - Are edge cases and error paths covered?
  - Are tests actually testing behavior (not implementation details)?
  - Is there production code that changed without corresponding test updates?

  ## Changed Files
  {list of ALL changed files, both test and non-test}

  Run `git diff origin/$BASE...HEAD -- <file>` for each file to see the exact changes.

  ## Review Focus

  **Test Coverage Gaps**:
  - Which changed production files lack corresponding test changes?
  - Are new functions/endpoints/components untested?
  - Are error paths and edge cases covered?

  **Test Quality**:
  - Do tests verify behavior or just implementation?
  - Are test names descriptive and clear?
  - Are assertions meaningful?
  - Is test setup minimal and focused?
  - Any redundant or duplicate test cases?

  **Missing Tests**:
  - Suggest specific test cases that should be added
  - Focus on high-value tests (happy path + most likely failure modes)
  - Do NOT suggest exhaustive edge-case testing for simple code

  ## Output Format

  **Coverage Summary**:
  - Files with tests: {count}
  - Files missing tests: {list}

  **Findings** (only if substantive):
  - **Gap**: [file] -- What is not tested and why it matters
  - **Quality Issue**: [test_file:line] -- What is wrong with the test
  - **Suggested Test**: Brief description of a test worth adding

  Be pragmatic. Not everything needs a test. Focus on code paths that could break."
```

### Security Reviewer (always runs)

```
Agent call:
- subagent_type: "context-engineering:security-auditor"
- prompt:
  "Review this PR's diff for security issues. This is a PR-scoped review, NOT a full security audit — only report issues INTRODUCED or AFFECTED by this PR.

  ## Changed Files
  {full list of changed files}

  Run `git diff origin/$BASE...HEAD` to see the full diff.
  Read commit messages (`git log origin/$BASE..HEAD --oneline`) to understand intent.

  Do NOT report pre-existing issues, theoretical vulnerabilities without evidence in the diff, or general recommendations not tied to specific changes.

  ## Output Format

  For each finding:
  - **Severity**: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
  - **[file:line]** -- Description
  - **Attack scenario** -- One sentence on how this could be exploited
  - **Fix** -- Brief remediation

  Categorize as:
  - **Must Fix**: CRITICAL/HIGH severity
  - **Should Fix**: MEDIUM severity
  - **Consider**: LOW severity

  If no security issues found, say 'No security issues identified in this PR' and briefly note what you checked."
```

### Devil's Advocate Reviewer (always runs)

```
Agent call:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- prompt:
  "You hate this implementation. Your job is to find real, verified problems — not style preferences.

  ## Changed Files
  {list of ALL changed files}

  Run `git diff origin/$BASE...HEAD` to see the full diff.
  Read commit messages (`git log origin/$BASE..HEAD --oneline`) to understand intent.

  ## Process

  1. Read the diff and form your harshest critique — what could break, what's fragile, what's wrong
  2. Batch your findings and verify them using up to 5 subagents (group related issues per subagent, use model: "sonnet" for each):
     - Edge case? Have the subagent trace the code path and confirm it's actually reachable
     - Race condition? Have the subagent check if concurrency is actually possible in this context
     - Missing validation? Have the subagent check if it's handled upstream
     - Wrong approach? Have the subagent find how similar problems are solved in this codebase
  3. Drop anything the subagent disproves. Only report verified issues.

  ## What to look for

  - Assumptions that break under load, concurrency, or unexpected input
  - Edge cases in the changed logic (nulls, empty collections, boundary values, unicode, timezone)
  - Error paths that silently swallow failures or leave state inconsistent
  - Coupling or design choices that will make the next change painful
  - Things that work now but will break when requirements inevitably shift

  ## What to skip

  - Style, naming, formatting — not your problem
  - Theoretical issues you can't verify from the code
  - Anything already covered by type system or framework guarantees

  ## Output Format

  For each VERIFIED finding:
  - **[file:line]** -- What's wrong
  - **Verification** -- What the subagent checked and confirmed
  - **Impact** -- What breaks and when
  - **Suggested fix** -- Brief, if you have one

  Categorize as:
  - **Must Fix**: Will cause bugs, data loss, or security issues
  - **Should Fix**: Fragile code that will bite someone soon
  - **Consider**: Design concerns worth discussing

  If the implementation is actually solid, say so. Don't manufacture problems."
```

### Feature Alignment Reviewer (always runs)

```
Agent call:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- prompt:
  "Review every change in this PR for feature alignment and intent clarity.

  ## Changed Files
  {list of ALL changed files}

  Run `git diff origin/$BASE...HEAD` to see the full diff.
  Read commit messages (`git log origin/$BASE..HEAD --oneline`) to understand the feature intent.

  ## Process

  1. Determine what feature/goal this PR is trying to accomplish from commit messages and the diff
  2. Group meaningful changes (not trivial reformats) and spawn up to 5 subagents (use model: "sonnet" for each) to verify them in batches. Each subagent should:
     - Read the surrounding code and understand the before/after context
     - Check how similar things are done elsewhere in the codebase
     - Determine if there's an existing pattern or utility that could be used instead
  3. Annotate every change with your assessment

  ## For each change, answer:

  - **What it does** -- One sentence explaining the change in plain language
  - **Why it's needed** -- How it serves the feature goal (or doesn't)
  - **Alignment** -- Does this change directly serve the feature, or is it tangential/unnecessary?
  - **Could it be done better?** -- Based on what the subagent found about existing codebase patterns

  ## Output Format

  ### Feature Intent
  One paragraph summarizing what this PR is trying to accomplish.

  ### Change-by-Change Review

  For each file (or logical group of changes):

  **[file:lines]** -- {what changed}
  - **Purpose**: Why this change exists
  - **Alignment**: Direct / Supportive / Tangential / Unnecessary
  - **Alternative**: {better approach if one exists, with codebase evidence from subagent}

  ### Summary
  - Changes that directly serve the feature: {count}
  - Changes that could be done better: {list}
  - Changes that seem unnecessary for this feature: {list, if any}
  - Overall assessment: is the PR focused and well-scoped?"
```

### Codex Adversarial Reviewer (only if Codex plugin installed)

Dispatch this in the SAME parallel batch as the other Step 5 reviewers (single message, multiple Agent tool calls). Skip entirely when `CODEX_AVAILABLE=0`.

Substitute the resolved absolute `$CODEX_PLUGIN_DIR` into the prompt before sending it.

```
Agent call:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- prompt:
  "You are dispatching the external Codex adversarial review for a PR review pipeline.
  Codex is an out-of-process reviewer that focuses on breaking confidence in the
  change (auth, data loss, race conditions, schema drift, observability gaps).

  ## Task

  1. Run this exact bash command and wait for it to complete (it may take several minutes):

     node \"$CODEX_PLUGIN_DIR/scripts/codex-companion.mjs\" adversarial-review --wait

     The `--wait` flag forces foreground execution and skips Codex's interactive
     'wait or run in background' prompt. Do not change the flag, do not switch
     to `--background`, do not call `/codex:status` or `/codex:result` — just
     block on this single command.

  2. Capture the full stdout verbatim. Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, reformat,
     or trim it. Codex returns structured findings; the deep-analyzer needs the
     raw output.

  3. If the command exits non-zero or returns no findings, report:
     'Codex adversarial review failed' followed by the captured stderr (last
     ~50 lines). Do not retry — the orchestrator will treat this as a missing
     reviewer.

  4. Return ONLY the verbatim Codex stdout (or the failure note above). No
     preamble, no commentary."
```

## Step 6: Deep Analysis & Artifact Generation

Do NOT compile the report yourself. After ALL Step 5 reviewers complete, collect every reviewer's full output verbatim and dispatch a single **deep-analyzer** agent. It verifies each finding is real, assesses impact, deduplicates, and writes two persistent artifacts (Markdown + HTML).

```
Agent call:
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"
- model: "opus"
- prompt:
  "You are the deep-analysis agent for a multi-reviewer PR review pipeline.
  Your job: take raw reviewer findings, verify each one is real, assess impact,
  deduplicate aggressively, and produce two artifacts (Markdown + HTML).

  ## Inputs

  ### Raw reviewer outputs (verbatim, do not paraphrase before analysis)
  {Backend reviewer output}
  {Frontend reviewer output}
  {QA reviewer output}
  {Security reviewer output}
  {Devil's Advocate reviewer output}
  {Feature Alignment reviewer output}
  {Codex Adversarial reviewer output, or "(Codex plugin not installed — skipped)" when CODEX_AVAILABLE=0}

  ### PR metadata
  - Base branch: origin/$BASE
  - Changed files: {list from Step 1}
  - Commit messages: output of `git log origin/$BASE..HEAD --oneline`
  - Cleanup applied: {/simplify summary}

  ## Process

  1. **Parse** every finding from every reviewer into a structured list:
     (source_reviewer, file, line, severity, description, suggested_fix).

  2. **Deduplicate** — group findings by (file, line-range, root-cause).
     Merge duplicates into a single entry; record ALL reviewers that flagged it.

  3. **Verify** — batch related findings and spawn up to 5 sub-subagents in
     parallel (one Agent call per batch, each with subagent_type: 'general-purpose'
     and model: 'sonnet'). Each sub-subagent must:
       - Read the cited file(s) at the cited lines
       - Trace the code path / call sites with grep
       - Confirm the issue is real and reachable from actual entry points
       - Return one of: VERIFIED | DISPUTED | NOT_REPRODUCIBLE, with a one-line reason

     Drop NOT_REPRODUCIBLE findings (record them in 'Dropped Findings' with the
     sub-subagent's reason). Mark DISPUTED findings and include the dispute reason
     in the report so the human reviewer can adjudicate.

  4. **Assess impact** — for each VERIFIED finding, write 1-2 sentences on:
       - What breaks (data loss, wrong output, crash, security exposure, etc.)
       - When it triggers (always, under load, on edge input, etc.)
       - Blast radius (single user, all users, downstream services)

  5. **Re-categorize** by impact, not by reviewer's original label:
       - Must Fix: real bugs, security issues, data loss risks
       - Should Fix: maintainability/quality issues with clear cost
       - Consider: optional, low-impact suggestions

     Drop pure style nits and over-engineering suggestions (extra abstraction
     layers, premature optimization).

  6. **Generate artifacts** — write BOTH files using the Write tool. Create the
     `thoughts/shared/reviews/` directory first if it does not exist (use Bash:
     `mkdir -p thoughts/shared/reviews`). Filename uses today's date and the
     branch name: `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{branch-slug}-review.{md,html}`.

     a) Markdown: `thoughts/shared/reviews/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{branch-slug}-review.md`
        Sections, in order:
          - Summary (one paragraph: PR intent + overall quality)
          - Verdict (Ready to merge | Needs changes, with counts)
          - Must Fix
          - Should Fix
          - Consider
          - Test Coverage (QA narrative)
          - Security (security summary)
          - Feature Alignment (intent, tangential changes, better alternatives)
          - Cleanup Applied (/simplify summary)
          - Disputed Findings (with dispute reason)
          - Dropped Findings (with NOT_REPRODUCIBLE reason)

        Each finding entry must include: **[file:line]**, description, **Impact:**,
        **Suggested fix:**, **Verification:** (what the sub-subagent checked),
        **Source reviewers:** (chips of reviewer names).

     b) HTML: `thoughts/shared/reviews/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{branch-slug}-review.html`
        Self-contained single file. Constraints:
          - Inline CSS, no external stylesheets, no JS frameworks
          - System font stack (-apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif)
          - Dark-mode-friendly palette (use `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media query)
          - Sticky header showing verdict + counts (Must / Should / Consider)
          - One collapsible <details> block per category and per narrative section
          - Each finding rendered as a card: monospace file:line, severity badge
            (color-coded), impact paragraph, suggested fix (in <pre> if code),
            verification line, source-reviewer chips
          - Vanilla <details>/<summary> for collapsibles — no JavaScript required

  7. **Return** to the orchestrator:
       - The two absolute file paths
       - Counts: must_fix / should_fix / consider / disputed / dropped
       - A one-paragraph executive summary of the PR's quality and verdict

  Do NOT print the full findings list in your return — the artifacts are the
  source of truth. The orchestrator only needs the summary and paths."
```

Wait for the deep-analyzer to complete before proceeding.

## Step 7: Present to User

Print a short chat summary using the deep-analyzer's return values. Do NOT re-list every finding inline — the artifacts are the source of truth.

```
## PR Review Complete

{one-paragraph executive summary from deep-analyzer}

**Verdict:** {Ready to merge | Needs changes}
**Findings:** {N must-fix} / {M should-fix} / {K consider}  ({D disputed}, {X dropped})

**Reports:**
- Markdown: `thoughts/shared/reviews/{date}-{branch}-review.md`
- HTML:     `thoughts/shared/reviews/{date}-{branch}-review.html`

To open the HTML report:
`open thoughts/shared/reviews/{date}-{branch}-review.html`
```

When `CODEX_AVAILABLE=0`, append this blockquote to the summary so the user knows an extra reviewer is available:

```
> **Tip:** Install the Codex plugin to add an out-of-process adversarial reviewer to this pipeline. Once installed, `/code-review` will automatically include it.
> - `/plugin marketplace add openai/codex`
> - `/plugin install codex@openai-codex`
> Requires the `codex` CLI on PATH (`brew install codex` or see openai/codex).
```

Do not add this tip when Codex was used in this run.
