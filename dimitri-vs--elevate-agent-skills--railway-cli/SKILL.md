# Railway CLI

Railway CLI for deploying and managing cloud applications.

Full CLI reference: https://docs.railway.com/reference/cli-api

## Important Notes

- **Monorepo**: For commands like `railway up`, ensure you are in the correct project subdirectory (e.g., `frontend/` or `backend/`)
- **Interactive commands**: `railway link`, `railway service`, `railway environment` are interactive by default. Use flags for non-interactive mode (see below).
- **Logs timeout**: Always run `railway logs` with a 5-second timeout as logs stream indefinitely
- **Deployments**: `railway up` may take up to 3-5 minutes to complete
- **JSON output**: All commands support `--json` flag for scripting

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Authentication
railway whoami                    # Check if logged in

# Storage Buckets (S3-compatible object storage)
# Create via Dashboard > Add > Storage Bucket
# Credentials appear as env vars: BUCKET_ENDPOINT, BUCKET_ACCESS_KEY_ID, etc.
# Python usage:
#   s3 = boto3.client('s3', endpoint_url=BUCKET_ENDPOINT,
#         aws_access_key_id=..., aws_secret_access_key=...)
#   s3.upload_file('file.png', BUCKET_NAME, 'path/file.png')

# Domains
railway domain                    # Generate Railway domain
railway domain example.com -p 8080  # Add custom domain with port

# Help
railway help                      # List all commands
railway help <command>            # Help for specific subcommand
```

## Deployment Workflow

### Initial Setup (Interactive)
```bash
railway login           # Opens browser
railway link            # Select project/env/service interactively
```

### Initial Setup (Non-Interactive / CI)
```bash
railway login --browserless                     # For SSH/Codespaces
railway link -p myproject -e production -s api  # Specify all options
```

### Deploy
```bash
# From the correct subdirectory (e.g., frontend-v2/ or backend-v2/)
railway up --detach     # Deploy and return immediately
railway up --ci         # Stream build logs, exit when done (for CI pipelines)
```

### Check Status
```bash
railway status
# For logs, use timeout:
timeout 5 railway logs -s <service> || true
```

## Configuration Files

### railway.json
**Important**: The config file path does NOT follow Root Directory. In dashboard settings, use absolute path like `/backend/railway.json`.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "RAILPACK",
    "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npx serve dist -l $PORT",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### Railpack Environment Variables
Railpack is the new default builder (Nixpacks is legacy). Configure with env vars:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `RAILPACK_PACKAGES` | Mise packages to install |
| `RAILPACK_BUILD_APT_PACKAGES` | Apt packages for build |
| `RAILPACK_DEPLOY_APT_PACKAGES` | Apt packages in final image |
| `RAILPACK_INSTALL_COMMAND` | Override install command |

See [Railpack docs](https://railpack.com/config/environment-variables) for full options.

### Monorepo Setup
1. Go to Railway Dashboard > Service > Settings
2. Set **Root Directory** to `/frontend` or `/backend`
3. Set **Railway Config File** to absolute path: `/frontend/railway.json`
4. Set **Watch Paths** using absolute paths: `/frontend/**`

## Running One-off Commands

### Using `railway run` (local command with Railway env vars)
```bash
# Injects Railway environment variables into local command
railway run --service=backend -- python script.py
```

### Using `railway shell` (subshell with env vars)
```bash
# Opens a new shell with all Railway env vars loaded
railway shell -s <service>
# Now all commands in this shell have access to env vars
```

### Using `railway ssh` (run inside container)
```bash
# List files in container
railway ssh -s <service> -- ls -la /

# Run script inside container
railway ssh -s <service> -- python /app/scripts/some_script.py
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"No start command found"**: Check Root Directory setting in dashboard
- **Port issues**: Vite/React apps need `$PORT` environment variable
- **Environment variables**: Prefix with `VITE_` for build-time availability in Vite apps
- **Variables syntax**: Use `railway variables --set "KEY=value"` (not `railway variables set`)

## Dashboard Settings Reference (as of 2026-01-22)

The Service > Settings page in the Railway dashboard has these sections:

### Source
- **Source Repo**: Connected GitHub repo with disconnect option
- **Root Directory**: Subdirectory for build/deploy (important for monorepos)
- **Branch**: Which branch triggers deployments for this environment
- **Wait for CI**: Option to wait for GitHub Actions before deploying

### Networking
- **Public Networking**:
  - Railway-generated domain (`*.up.railway.app`) with port configuration
  - Custom domains with proxy detection
  - Target port setting for each domain
- **Private Networking**:
  - Internal hostname (`<service>.railway.internal`) for service-to-service communication
  - Can also use short name (`<service>`) within the project
- **Static Outbound IPs**: Optional permanent IP for outbound traffic

### Build
- **Builder**: Railpack (new default) or Nixpacks (legacy). Configure via env vars or `railpack.json`
- **Metal Build Environment**: Faster builds (becoming default)
- **Providers**: Auto-detected language (Python, Node, etc.)
- **Custom Build Command**: Override default build command (follows Root Directory)
- **Watch Paths**: Gitignore-style patterns to trigger deploys on specific path changes
  - **Note**: Patterns always operate from repo root `/`, even with a Root Directory set. For root directory `/app`, use `/app/**/*.js` to match files.

### Deploy
- **Custom Start Command**: Command to run the service
- **Pre-deploy Command**: Runs before the main service starts (e.g., migrations)
- **Regions**: Select deployment regions and replica count
- **Teardown**: Configure old deployment termination behavior
- **Resource Limits**: CPU (up to 32 vCPU) and Memory (up to 32 GB) per replica
- **Cron Schedule**: Run service on a cron schedule
- **Healthcheck Path**: Endpoint to verify deployment is live before completing
- **Serverless**: Scale to zero when idle, wake on traffic
- **Restart Policy**: What to do on process exit (Never, Always, On Failure with retry count)

### Config-as-code
- **Railway Config File**: Path to `railway.json` or `railway.toml` for version-controlled settings
  - **Note**: Does NOT follow Root Directory. Use absolute path like `/backend/railway.toml`

### Root Directory Behavior
When a Root Directory is set, these settings follow it:
- Build command, start command, pre-deploy command

These do **NOT** follow Root Directory (always use absolute paths from repo root):
- **Watch Paths**: Use `/app/**/*.js` not `**/*.js` for root dir `/app`
- **Railway Config File**: Use `/backend/railway.toml` not `railway.toml`

### Storage Buckets
Railway provides S3-compatible object storage ("Buckets") as a first-party service.

- **Pricing**: $0.015/GB-month storage. Egress and API calls are **free** (unlimited).
- **Access**: Private-only (no public URLs). Use presigned URLs or serve through your app.
- **S3 compatibility**: Full — works with boto3, AWS SDK, any S3 client. Set `endpoint_url` to the bucket endpoint.
- **Setup**: Dashboard > Add > Storage Bucket. Credentials (endpoint, access key, secret, bucket name) are injected as env vars into linked services.
- **Limits**: No documented caps on object count or request rate. Billed per storage used.
- **Compared to alternatives**: Same storage price as Cloudflare R2, cheaper than AWS S3 ($0.023/GB). Unlike R2, no per-operation charges. Unlike S3, no egress fees.

### Danger Zone
- **Delete Service**: Permanently removes service and all deployments from the environment
