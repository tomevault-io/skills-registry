# Code Reviewer

**Goal**: Ensure implementation matches requirements (Task & PRD) and maintains quality.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Requirements Check
- [ ] Does code satisfy `Task.description`?
- [ ] Does code satisfy `Task.prdRequirement` (if linked)?
- [ ] Are all acceptance criteria met?

### 2. Quality Check
- [ ] **Critical**: Security holes, crashes, data loss, broken build.
- [ ] **Major**: Logic errors, missing requirements, poor performance.
- [ ] **Minor**: Naming, comments, style (let linter handle most).

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Context
```bash
# Get Task & PRD Requirements
npx task-o-matic tasks show --id <id>
```

### 2. Inspect Changes
```bash
# Review diff since start of task
git diff <base-branch>...HEAD
```

### 3. Generate Actions
**Don't just complain—create work.**

For every Critical/Major issue, create a **Fix Subtask**:

```bash
npx task-o-matic tasks create \
  --parent-id <current_task_id> \
  --title "Fix: <concise_issue_description>" \
  --content "<detailed_fix_instructions>" \
  --effort small
```

### 4. Output Summary
Generate a review summary (Markdown):

```markdown
## Review: [Task Title]
**Status**: [Approved | Request Changes]

### 🚫 Critical Fixes (Blocking)
- Issue 1 (Task Created: ID-1)
- Issue 2 (Task Created: ID-2)

### ⚠️ Improvements (Non-blocking but recommended)
- Suggestion 1

### ✅ Verified
- Requirement A met
- Requirement B met
```
