## What I do

- Start at the current directory and search through all subdirectories for Makefiles
    - `find . -name "Makefile" -type "f"`
- Make a list of the targets in each makefile that only affect the user's host
- Only test one Makefile at a time
    - Start with the Makefile closest to the root directory and work further from the root directory
- Run each target in dry-run mode
    - If the result of the dry-run of the target is non-zero, report that result as a failure
    - If the result of the dry-run of the target is zero, report that result as a success
- For the targets that only affect the user's host, run each target
    - If the result of the target is non-zero, report that result as a failure
    - If the result of the target is zero, report that result as a success
    - If there are targets that build docker images, ask how long the user would like to wait for the docker build to complete and use that as a timeout for any make targets that invoke a docker build
- When a target fails, continue testing the remaining targets
- Generate a detailed report of which targets passed and which targets failed, including the error messages for the failed targets
- At the end of testing all the targets, generate a summary report of how many targets passed and how many targets failed
    - Output results both in a table and in a summary statement
        - The table should be broken out into sections for each makefile, with the targets listed under each makefile and one row per target, with columns for the target name, the result of the dry-run, and the result of the actual run
        - The summary statement should include the total number of targets tested, the number of targets that passed, and the number of targets that failed

## When to use me

After making many batch changes to one makefile or many makefiles
Before pushing a branch with changes to one makefile or many makefiles
When researching a project for the first time
If a developer is unfamiliar with a project
