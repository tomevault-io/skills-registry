# Flutter App Release

Release Flutter apps to iOS App Store, Android Play Store, and web hosting platforms.

## When to Use

- Building Flutter releases for iOS, Android, or web
- Publishing to TestFlight, App Store, or Play Store
- Deploying Flutter web apps
- Managing versions and build numbers
- Setting up automated releases

## Versioning

**pubspec.yaml:** `version: 1.2.3+45` (semantic version + build number)

```bash
flutter pub version patch  # 1.2.3 → 1.2.4
flutter pub version minor  # 1.2.x → 1.3.0
flutter pub version major  # 1.x.x → 2.0.0
```

**Rule:** Increment build number (+45 → +46) for every release

## Quick Release

### iOS
```bash
flutter build ipa --release
cd ios && fastlane beta  # TestFlight
```

### Android
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
cd android && fastlane internal  # Internal testing
```

### Web
```bash
flutter build web --release
firebase deploy --only hosting  # Firebase
# or: netlify deploy --prod
```

## Platform Setup

### iOS
```bash
brew install fastlane
cd ios && fastlane init
# Requires: Xcode, Apple Developer account
```

### Android
```bash
cd android && fastlane init
# Requires: Keystore, Play Console service account
```

### Web
```bash
firebase init hosting
# or setup: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages
```

## Best Practices

✅ Test on TestFlight/internal before production, use staged rollouts, increment versions
❌ Don't commit signing keys, skip testing, or release to 100% immediately

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Clean build
flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Build
flutter build ipa --release          # iOS
flutter build appbundle --release    # Android
flutter build web --release          # Web

# Release
cd ios && fastlane beta             # TestFlight
cd android && fastlane production   # Play Store
firebase deploy --only hosting      # Web
```
