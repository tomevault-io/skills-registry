# GitHub Actions CI/CD

Create and manage GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration, testing, and deployment pipelines.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating new workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
- Setting up PR validation and automated testing
- Configuring deployment pipelines (staging/production)
- Managing GitHub secrets and environment variables
- Debugging workflow failures
- Setting up manual workflow triggers or deployment approvals

## Prerequisites

**Required:** GitHub repository with Actions enabled

**Tools:** [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`), [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) (optional, for local testing)

## Workflow Basics

**Location:** `.github/workflows/<name>.yaml`

**Structure:**
```yaml
name: Workflow Name
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  job-name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "Hello"
```

## Common Patterns

### PR Validation
```yaml
on: pull_request
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci && npm test
```

### Environment Deployments
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production  # Requires approval
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: ./deploy.sh
```

### Manual Triggers
```yaml
on: workflow_dispatch  # Shows "Run workflow" button
```

## Secrets Management

**Add:** Repository Settings → Secrets → New secret

**Use:**
```yaml
env:
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

## Debugging

```bash
gh run list            # List runs
gh run view <id>       # View details
gh run watch           # Watch real-time
gh run rerun <id>      # Retry failed run
```

## Templates & References

- **[PR Checks Template](templates/pr-checks.yaml)** - Lint and test validation
- **[Multi-Environment Deploy](templates/multi-env-deploy.yaml)** - Staging/production pipeline
- **[Production with Approval](templates/production-approval.yaml)** - Manual approval workflow
- **[Matrix Testing](templates/matrix-testing.yaml)** - Test across versions/platforms
- **[Workflow Patterns](references/workflow-patterns.md)** - Advanced configurations
- **[Triggers Reference](references/triggers.md)** - All trigger types and options
- **[Troubleshooting](references/troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions

## Best Practices

✅ Pin action versions (`@v4`), cache dependencies, use environments for production
❌ Never hardcode secrets, don't use `pull_request_target` without understanding risks

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Workflows
gh workflow list
gh workflow run <name>

# Runs
gh run list
gh run view <id>
gh run cancel <id>

# Secrets
gh secret set NAME
gh secret list
```

## Common Actions

- `actions/checkout@v4` - Clone repository
- `actions/setup-node@v4` - Setup Node.js
- `actions/cache@v4` - Cache dependencies
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4` - Save files
