# Show Planner Status

You are now executing the planner-status skill. Follow these steps immediately:

## Step 1: Check Initialization

Verify planner is initialized:

1. Check if `plans/PROGRESS.md` exists
2. If not found, respond:

   ```
   Planner is not initialized in this project.

   To initialize: Tell me "Initialize planner"
   ```

3. Stop here if not initialized

## Step 1b: Find Spec Files

Check for any spec files in the project:

1. Use Glob: `plans/*-spec.md`
2. For each spec found:
   - Read the Configuration section to extract status (DRAFT, ACTIVE, DEPRECATED)
   - Store spec filename and status
3. Store specs list for display

## Step 2: Read PROGRESS.md

Read the full content of `plans/PROGRESS.md`:

1. Use Read tool: `plans/PROGRESS.md`
2. For large files, use Grep to extract table sections if needed

## Step 3: Parse Plan Tables

Extract all feature sections and their plan tables.

**Look for patterns:**

- `### Feature Name` headings
- Table rows: `| plan-name.md | STATUS | DATE |`

**Extract for each plan:**

- Plan filename
- Status (NOT STARTED, IN PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED)
- Completion date (if applicable)
- Feature/section name

## Step 4: Calculate Statistics

Count plans by status:

- Total plans: [N]
- Completed: [X]
- In Progress: [Y]
- Failed: [Z]
- Not Started: [W]

Calculate percentage: `(Completed / Total) * 100`

## Step 5: Display Compact Format

Show the status using this format:

```
======================================
PLANNER STATUS
======================================

Overall Progress: [##########..........] 50% (5/10)

[If specs exist:]
======================================
SPECIFICATIONS
======================================
| Spec              | Status      | Related Plans |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| auth-spec.md      | ACTIVE      | 5 plans       |
| checkout-spec.md  | DRAFT       | 0 plans       |
| old-spec.md       | DEPRECATED  | 3 plans       |

[End if]

------ Feature Name 1 ------
[x] plan-01.md (Completed 2026-01-09)
[~] plan-02.md (IN PROGRESS)
[ ] plan-03.md
[!] plan-04.md (FAILED)

------ Feature Name 2 ------
[x] plan-05.md (Completed 2026-01-08)
[x] plan-06.md (Completed 2026-01-09)

======================================
IN PROGRESS
======================================
| Plan              | Feature      |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| plan-02.md        | Feature 1    |

======================================
FAILED
======================================
| Plan              | Feature      |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| plan-04.md        | Feature 1    |

======================================
COMPLETED PLANS
======================================
- plan-01.md (Feature 1)
- plan-05.md (Feature 2)
- plan-06.md (Feature 2)

======================================
SUGGESTED COMMANDS
======================================
[Based on current state - see logic below]
```

**Status Icons (Plans):**

- `[x]` = COMPLETED
- `[ ]` = NOT STARTED
- `[~]` = IN PROGRESS
- `[!]` = FAILED

**Spec Status Values:**

- `DRAFT` = Spec is being worked on
- `ACTIVE` = Spec is approved, ready for plan generation
- `DEPRECATED` = Spec is superseded or no longer valid

## Step 6: Suggest Commands

Based on current state, suggest relevant commands:

**If has DRAFT specs:**

```
Review spec: Open plans/[prefix]-spec.md
Approve spec: Update status to ACTIVE in the spec file
Generate plans: /planner:spec-plans-sync [prefix]
```

**If has ACTIVE specs with no plans:**

```
Generate plans from spec: /planner:spec-plans-sync [prefix]
```

**If has IN PROGRESS plans:**

```
Continue current: Tell me "Execute [plan-name]"
```

**If has NOT STARTED plans (dependencies met):**

```
Start next: Tell me "Execute [plan-name]"
```

**If has plans with same prefix:**

```
Run batch: Tell me "Execute all [prefix] plans"
```

**If has FAILED plans:**

```
Retry failed: Tell me "Execute [failed-plan]"
```

**If all complete:**

```
All done! 🎉
Create more spec: /planner:spec-create [prefix] "[description]"
Create more plans: Tell me "Create plans for [new feature]"
```

## Reference Information

### What This Skill Does

When showing status, this skill:

1. Finds all spec files (`plans/*-spec.md`) and shows their status
2. Reads `plans/PROGRESS.md` to get plan statuses
3. Shows specs with their status (DRAFT, ACTIVE, DEPRECATED) and related plan count
4. Shows all plans with IN PROGRESS, FAILED or NOT STARTED as tables
5. Shows a list of all COMPLETED plans at the bottom
6. Provides helpful commands for continuing work (including spec-related commands)

### Parsing PROGRESS.md Tables

Extract feature sections:

```markdown
### Feature Name Implementation

| Plan                         | Status      | Date       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| prefix-00-initial-setup.md   | COMPLETED   | 2026-01-08 |
| prefix-01-database-schema.md | IN PROGRESS |            |
| prefix-02-api-endpoints.md   | NOT STARTED |            |
```

For each table row:

1. Extract plan filename (column 1)
2. Extract status (column 2): trim whitespace
3. Extract date (column 3): may be empty
4. Associate with feature from `### Feature Name` heading

### Edge Cases

**No Plans Found:**

```
======================================
PLANNER STATUS
======================================

No plans found.

Create plans: Tell me "Create plans for [feature description]"

Example: "Create plans for adding user authentication with login and signup"
```

**All Plans Completed:**

```
======================================
PLANNER STATUS
======================================

Overall Progress: [####################] 100% (10/10)

All plans completed! 🎉

Completed plans:
- auth-00-setup.md (Authentication)
- auth-01-database.md (Authentication)
- auth-02-api.md (Authentication)
...

Create more: Tell me "Create plans for [new feature]"
```

### Suggested Commands Logic

| State                            | Suggested Commands                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Has DRAFT specs                  | Review spec, Approve spec, Generate plans   |
| Has ACTIVE specs (no plans)      | Generate plans: spec-plans-sync [prefix]    |
| Has IN PROGRESS plan             | Continue current: Execute [plan]            |
| Has NOT STARTED plans (deps met) | Start next: Execute [plan]                  |
| Has plans with same prefix       | Run batch: Execute all [prefix] plans       |
| All complete                     | Create more spec or plans                   |
| Has FAILED plans                 | Retry: Execute [failed-plan]                |

### Example

```
User: Show me the status of test plans

Step 1: Check initialization
→ Found plans/PROGRESS.md

Step 2: Read PROGRESS.md
→ Reading file...

Step 3: Parse tables
→ Found feature: "Test Suite Implementation"
→ Plans: test-00-unit.md (COMPLETED), test-01-integration.md (IN PROGRESS), test-02-e2e.md (NOT STARTED)

Step 4: Calculate statistics
→ Total: 3, Completed: 1, In Progress: 1, Not Started: 1
→ Percentage: 33%

Step 5: Display format
→ Show progress bar, feature sections, status tables

Step 6: Suggest commands
→ Continue current: Execute test-01-integration.md
→ Run batch: Execute all test plans
```
