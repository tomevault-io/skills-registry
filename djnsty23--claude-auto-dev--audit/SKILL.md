# Audit

Find bugs, violations, and quality issues. Creates fix stories in prd.json.

**Scope:** Audit owns all bug/violation/quality findings. Brainstorm owns feature ideas and architecture improvements. No overlap.

## Existing Tasks
!`node -e "try{const p=require('./prd.json');const sp=p.sprints?p.sprints[p.sprints.length-1]:p;Object.entries(sp.stories||p.stories||{}).forEach(([k,v])=>console.log(k,v.passes===true?'done':v.passes==='deferred'?'deferred':'pending',v.title))}catch(e){}"`

## Swarm Architecture

## Execution

### Size Gate (choose agent count by codebase size)

Before launching agents, count source files:
```bash
find src/ app/ packages/ -name '*.ts' -o -name '*.tsx' -o -name '*.js' -o -name '*.jsx' 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

| Files | Strategy | Agents |
|-------|----------|--------|
| < 50 | **Compact** — single Opus agent, all 7 checks sequentially | 1 |
| 50-200 | **Medium** — 3 agents (security+types, perf+a11y, UX+tests+deploy) | 3 |
| 200+ | **Full swarm** — all 7 agents in parallel | 7 |

For **compact** mode (< 50 files), use a single agent with all checks combined:
```typescript
Agent({ subagent_type: "Explore", model: "opus",
  prompt: "Full quality audit for [PROJECT_PATH]. Limit to 80 tool calls. Check ALL of: 1) Security (secrets, XSS, injection, RLS), 2) Performance (memo, effects, re-renders), 3) Accessibility (alt, aria, keyboard), 4) Type safety (any, ts-ignore, console.log), 5) UX/UI (loading/error/empty states, hardcoded colors, responsive), 6) Test gaps, 7) Deploy readiness (env vars, asset paths). Report: Severity, File:line, Issue, Fix." })
```

For **medium** mode (50-200 files), launch 3 combined agents.

For **full swarm** (200+ files), launch all 7 agents below.

Replace `[PROJECT_PATH]` with the actual working directory path.

**Important:** Each agent is capped at ~80 tool calls to avoid rate limits. Scope scans to specific directories.

```typescript
Task({ subagent_type: "Explore", model: "opus", run_in_background: true,
  prompt: "Security audit for [PROJECT_PATH]. Limit to 80 tool calls. Scan: exposed secrets (check src/ AND supabase/migrations/ for hardcoded keys, passwords, service_role, cron secrets), dangerouslySetInnerHTML, eval(), missing Zod validation, SQL injection, XSS vectors, CORS config. ALSO check: 1) Supabase RLS policy LOGIC — not just enabled, but correct: flag always-true USING clauses, INSERT WITH CHECK (true), tables with PII allowing SELECT without auth.uid(). 2) Fail-open auth — if (session) allow without default deny. 3) SSRF — user URLs passed to fetch without private IP validation. 4) Missing middleware — /dashboard/*, /api/* routes without auth checks. 5) Unsafe casts — 'as unknown as Type' on DB/API data without Zod validation. 6) Fire-and-forget fetch — fetch() without res.ok check or try/catch. Report: Severity, File:line, Issue, Fix." })

Task({ subagent_type: "Explore", model: "opus", run_in_background: true,
  prompt: "Performance audit for [PROJECT_PATH]. Limit to 80 tool calls. Scan: missing React.memo on list items, useEffect without cleanup, inline objects in JSX, missing lazy loading, N+1 queries. Report: Severity, File:line, Issue, Fix." })

Task({ subagent_type: "Explore", model: "opus", run_in_background: true,
  prompt: "Accessibility audit for [PROJECT_PATH]. Limit to 80 tool calls. Scan: images without alt, missing aria-labels, onClick without onKeyDown, missing form labels, hardcoded colors, undersized touch targets (<44px), div/span with onClick (should be button), outline-none without focus-visible replacement, user-scalable=no or maximum-scale=1, missing autocomplete on form inputs, inputs without correct type/inputmode, onPaste with preventDefault, missing prefers-reduced-motion support, autoFocus without justification. SKIP false positives: transition-all is perf not a11y (report as Low/perf if at all), console.error is acceptable (only flag console.log), test files don't need strict a11y. Report: Severity, File:line, Issue, Fix." })

Task({ subagent_type: "Explore", model: "opus", run_in_background: true,
  prompt: "Type safety + code quality audit for [PROJECT_PATH]. Limit to 80 tool calls. Scan: 'any' usage (skip test files and type declaration files), @ts-ignore, type assertions without guards ('as unknown as'), conflicting type definitions, untyped API responses. ALSO scan: console.log/warn statements (NOT console.error — that's acceptable), count per file, report top 5 offenders. Empty catch blocks, API calls without error handling (missing res.ok check or try/catch). SKIP: test files for strict typing, .d.ts files, node_modules. Report: Severity, File:line, Issue, Fix." })

Task({ subagent_type: "Explore", model: "opus", run_in_background: true,
  prompt: "UX/UI audit for [PROJECT_PATH]. Limit to 80 tool calls. Scan: missing loading states, missing empty states, missing error states, hardcoded colors instead of tokens (exception: hardcoded colors on gradient/themed surfaces are OK), missing toast feedback, images without width/height (causes CLS), missing loading=lazy on below-fold images, large lists without virtualization (50+ items .map). ALSO check responsive layout: sidebars without mobile hide/toggle (must use hidden md:block pattern), grids without mobile breakpoints (need grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2), fixed-width containers that overflow on mobile, touch targets under 44px, missing mobile navigation (hamburger/drawer), modals not full-screen on mobile. ALSO check: hardcoded date/number formats (should use Intl.*), missing text truncation on user-generated content, flex children without min-w-0. Report: Severity, File:line, Issue, Fix." })

Task({ subagent_type: "Explore", model: "opus", run_in_background: true,
  prompt: "Test coverage audit for [PROJECT_PATH]. Limit to 80 tool calls. Scan: auth flows without tests, data mutations without tests, hooks without test files, utilities without tests. List critical gaps. Report: Severity, What needs testing, Priority." })

Task({ subagent_type: "Explore", model: "opus", run_in_background: true,
  prompt: "Deploy readiness audit for [PROJECT_PATH]. Limit to 80 tool calls. Scan for runtime issues that unit tests miss: 1) PWA manifest (manifest.json/site.webmanifest) - check every icon/screenshot path references a file that actually exists in public/. 2) Environment variables - check all process.env/import.meta.env references have values set (no trailing newlines/whitespace). 3) Supabase config - check anon key for trailing newline characters that break WebSocket URLs. 4) Asset references - grep for paths like /icons/, /images/, /screenshots/ in source and verify the files exist in public/. 5) next.config/vercel.json - check for mismatched rewrites or missing headers. Report: Severity, File:line, Issue, Fix." })

| **High** | Significant UX degradation or major debt | 5s load, no error handling |
| **Medium** | Noticeable but not blocking | Missing loading state |
| **Low** | Nice to have, polish | console.log left in |

## Persist Findings to prd.json

After aggregating results, write all findings to prd.json so they persist across sessions.

### Step 1: Read current prd.json

```bash
# Get current sprint number and existing story IDs
node -e "try{const p=require('./prd.json');const sp=p.sprints?p.sprints[p.sprints.length-1]:p;console.log('sprint:',sp.id||sp.name||p.sprint||'unknown','stories:',Object.keys(sp.stories||p.stories||{}).length)}catch{console.log('no prd.json')}"
```

If no prd.json exists, create one with `sprint: 1`.

### Step 2: Deduplicate against existing stories

Before adding, check if a similar story already exists:

```javascript
// Match by title similarity (first 25 chars) or same file:line
const isDuplicate = (title, file) => Object.values(stories).some(s =>
  s.title.toLowerCase().includes(title.toLowerCase().slice(0, 25)) ||
  (file && s.notes?.includes(file))
);
```

### Step 3: Add new stories to prd.json

Use ID format: `S{sprint}-AUD-{number}` (e.g., `S3-AUD-001`)

```json
{
  "S3-AUD-001": {
    "id": "S3-AUD-001",
    "title": "Fix XSS vulnerability in user input",
    "priority": 0,
    "passes": null,
    "type": "fix",
    "category": "security",
    "notes": "src/api/auth.ts:45 - dangerouslySetInnerHTML with user data",
    "resolution": ""
  }
}
```

**Category → type mapping:**

| Audit Category | prd.json type | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|---------------|---------------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| Security | fix | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Performance | perf | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Accessibility | fix | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Type Safety | fix | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| UX/UI | fix | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Test Coverage | qa | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Deploy Readiness | fix | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |

### Step 4: Also create session Tasks

Create native TaskCreate entries for the current session so "auto" can immediately start fixing:

```typescript
TaskCreate({
  subject: "Fix XSS vulnerability in user input",
  description: "src/api/auth.ts:45 - dangerouslySetInnerHTML with user data",
  metadata: { type: "security", priority: 0, prdId: "S3-AUD-001" }
});
```

### Step 5: Report

```
Created [X] stories in prd.json from audit findings.
- [N] Critical (priority 0)
- [N] High (priority 1)
- [N] Medium (priority 2)
- [N] Low (priority 3)
- [N] skipped (duplicates of existing stories)

Say "auto" to start fixing (works Critical→Low), or "audit [feature]" to audit specific area.
```

### Step 6: Score Tracking

After generating the report, log the score to `.claude/sprint-history.md`:
```markdown
## Audit [DATE]
| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Security | X/10 |
| Performance | X/10 |
| ... | ... |
| **Overall** | **X/10** |
| **Delta** | **+/-X from last audit** |
```

Compare against previous audit scores if available. Report improvement or regression.

### Step 7: npm Audit

Run alongside the agent swarm (not a separate agent — just a bash command):
```bash
npm audit --production 2>/dev/null | tail -15
```

Include critical/high vulnerabilities in the Security category of the report.

## Focused Audit

User can audit specific features:
- `audit auth` → Only scan auth-related files
- `audit dashboard` → Only scan dashboard components
- `audit latest` → Audit files changed in last 3 commits

## Quick Validation (No Agents)

For consistency checks only (triggers, descriptions, versions, frontmatter), run:
```bash
node validate.js
```
This is instant and free — use it before committing. The full agent audit is for deep analysis (security, UX, performance) that static checks can't find.

## Token Cost

- 7 parallel Opus agents. Token cost varies by codebase size.
- Time: 2-4 minutes (parallel execution)
- Context efficient: agents run in background, results aggregated

## Real Results (From Production Test)

Last audit of Data Globe (247 files):

| Category | Critical | High | Total |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| Security | 2 | 5 | 14 |
| Performance | 0 | 4 | 8 |
| Accessibility | 2 | 5 | 7 |
| Type Safety | 1 | 2 | 8 |
| UX/UI | 3 | 4 | 10 |
| Test Coverage | 23 | 15 | 38 |
| **Overall Score** | **5.5/10** | - | **85 issues** |

Key findings:
- Test coverage is the biggest gap (95% hooks untested)
- 68 components use hardcoded colors
- Edge Functions lack input validation
- 530 console statements in production

## Quality Framework Reference

When rating findings, apply principles from related skills:

| Skill | What to Reference |
|-------|-------------------|
| `standards` | Type safety, design tokens, all UI states, React patterns, error handling |
| `design` | Color tokens vs hardcoded, typography consistency, structural integrity for UI changes |

**UX/UI Agent should check:**
- Hardcoded colors → Reference `design` (avoid purple gradients, avoid Inter/Roboto)
- Missing states → Reference `standards` (loading, empty, error)
- Design tokens → Reference `standards` design system rules

**Type Safety Agent should check:**
- Against `standards` patterns (single source of truth, complete Records, strict mode, no any)

## Log Patterns to Mistakes

When audit finds repeated issues (3+ files):
```markdown
## Pattern: [Category]
- **Task:** Audit finding
- **Root cause:** Why pattern violated
- **Prevention:** Rule to add
```
Log to `.claude/mistakes.md` for future reference.

## Plan Mode for Critical Fixes

When audit finds 5+ Critical/High severity issues, suggest plan mode:

**Suggestion format:**
```
⚠️ Found [N] Critical/High issues across [M] files.

These fixes may have cascading effects. Would you like me to enter plan mode to:
1. Analyze dependencies between fixes
2. Design fix order to prevent regressions
3. Identify shared root causes

Say "plan" to design fix strategy, or "auto" to fix immediately.
```

**In plan mode:**
1. Group related issues by root cause
2. Identify fix order (security first, then stability)
3. Map file dependencies
4. Present staged fix plan
5. Execute fixes in safe order
