# Auto Mode

Fully autonomous development. Works through all tasks without stopping until complete.

## Current State
!`git status --short`
!`node -e "try{const p=require('./prd.json');const sp=p.sprints?p.sprints[p.sprints.length-1]:p;const s=Object.values(sp.stories||p.stories||{});const name=sp.id||sp.name||p.sprint||'unknown';const done=s.filter(x=>x.passes===true).length;const pend=s.filter(x=>x.passes===null||x.passes===false).length;console.log('Sprint:',name,'| Done:',done,'| Pending:',pend,'| Total:',s.length)}catch(e){console.log('No prd.json')}"`

## Entry Flow

```
auto
  |-- Activate: write .claude/auto-active
  |-- Check prd.json exists?
  |   |-- No -> Bootstrap from context
  |   +-- Yes -> Check pending tasks
  |               |-- None pending -> IDLE Detection
  |               +-- Has pending -> Execute tasks
  |
  +-- Execute until done or interrupted
  +-- Deactivate: delete .claude/auto-active
```

## Auto-Active Flag (Continuous Execution)

On start, create the flag file using the **Write tool** (not Bash echo — avoids sensitive file permission prompt):
```
Write tool → .claude/auto-active
Content: {"started":"<current ISO timestamp>","sprint":"<current sprint>"}
```

This flag tells the Stop hook to block Claude from stopping. Claude keeps working as long as this flag exists.

On exit (user says "done", or nothing left), **do not `rm` the flag** — Bash ops on `.claude/` trigger a sensitive-file permission prompt even under bypass. Instead, simply stop working. The Stop hook owns the flag lifecycle:

- Stale flags (>2h old) are auto-cleaned
- Sprint-complete → hook runs IDLE detection once, then approves stop and removes the flag on the next attempt
- No prd.json → hook approves stop and removes the flag immediately

If the user explicitly says "deactivate auto" mid-sprint, use the **Write tool** to create `.claude/auto-exit` (empty file). The Stop hook treats that as an unconditional exit signal and cleans up both files.

## Autonomous Behavior

Do not ask "Should I continue?" or show summaries and wait.

Instead:
- Make autonomous decisions
- Keep working until truly done
- The Stop hook prevents Claude from ending — trust it

## Persist to prd.json

When findings, scan results, or ad-hoc issues are identified during execution, write them to prd.json as stories before fixing them. prd.json is the source of truth that survives session restarts and /compact.

## Lightweight Mode

If the user gives a direct instruction (e.g., "fix this button", "update that copy") rather than saying "auto":
- Skip prd.json and sprint creation entirely
- Just fix, verify, done
- Use prd.json only when there are 5+ tasks to track

## Bootstrap (No prd.json)

When prd.json does not exist:

1. Read CLAUDE.md, README.md, package.json for context
2. Generate 5-10 starter tasks based on project
3. Create prd.json with stories
4. Continue immediately — do not stop for approval

## Pre-flight (Smart)

Before first task, run these checks. Use simple commands that won't trigger security filters:

```bash
# 1. Git status
git status --short

# 2. Dependencies fresh?
# Compare timestamps — if package.json is newer than node_modules, run npm install
ls -lt package.json node_modules/.package-lock.json 2>/dev/null | head -1
```
If package.json is newer or node_modules is missing, run `npm install`.

```bash
# 3. Detect test runner — read package.json with Read tool, check for vitest/jest/playwright in devDependencies
# Use the detected runner for all test steps in this session

# 4. Build check
npm run build 2>&1 | tail -5

# 5. Branch check
git branch --show-current
```
If on main/master, create a feature branch before making changes.

```bash
# 6. Worktree cleanup
git worktree prune 2>/dev/null
```

Skip individual checks if they take >10 seconds. Use Read tool to inspect package.json instead of `node -e` one-liners.

## Task Execution

### Find Next Task

```javascript
// prd.json has two shapes:
// Flat:   { stories: { "S1-001": {...} }, sprint: "sprint-1" }
// Nested: { sprints: [{ id: "sprint-1", stories: { "S1-001": {...} } }] }
const sp = prd.sprints ? prd.sprints[prd.sprints.length - 1] : prd;
const stories = sp.stories || prd.stories || {};
const storyEntries = Object.entries(stories);
const executable = storyEntries.filter(([id, s]) =>
  s.passes !== true &&
  (s.blockedBy || []).every(dep => stories[dep]?.passes === true)
);
```

### Size-Gate Before Executing

Before starting a task, assess its scope:
- **Small** (1-3 files, clear fix) → execute directly
- **Medium** (3-5 files, clear approach) → execute with extra caution
- **Large** (5+ files, new feature, multiple integrations) → write a 3-sentence inline plan before coding:
  1. What changes
  2. What systems are affected
  3. What to verify after

  Then execute. Do not stop to ask — the inline plan is sufficient for auto mode.

### Execute Each Task

1. **Progress output**: `[3/8] Starting: S6-003 — Add loading states`
2. Read the task description
3. **Context Loading** — read 2-3 similar files to match existing patterns
4. **Apply Generation Constraints** (see below) — before writing code
5. Implement the solution
6. **Self-Critique** — re-read your diff before running checks (see below)
7. `npm run typecheck` — fix if fails
8. `npm run build` — fix if fails
9. Self-Verification (see below)
10. **Visual verification** — if the task touched UI, run agent-browser or Playwright screenshots. Do not skip this.
11. **Test generation** — if the task created an API route, auth logic, or data mutation, write at least one test (see below)
12. **Progress output**: `[3/8] ✓ S6-003 | Next: S6-004`
13. Update prd.json: `passes: true`
14. Start next task immediately

### Generation Constraints (apply before writing code)

These constraints prevent bugs at generation time instead of finding them in audit:

**TypeScript Strictness:**
- In strict projects with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, always write optional props as `foo?: string | undefined` (not just `foo?: string`) — saves a retry cycle every time

**Security & Data Safety:**
- Every `fetch()` in a component MUST have try/catch and `res.ok` check
- Every user-supplied URL in server code MUST be validated before fetch
- Every `process.env.X` for security vars MUST throw if undefined (no localhost fallbacks)
- Never cast with `as unknown as` — validate with Zod or type guard
- Never use `createClient()` in webhook/cron routes — use `createServiceClient()`
- Every new API route MUST be added to middleware route matcher / PUBLIC_PREFIXES if public

**Accessibility:**
- Every `<input>` MUST have an associated `<label>` or `aria-label`
- Every `<select>` MUST have an `aria-label`
- Every icon-only `<button>` MUST have an `aria-label`
- Every `<button>` MUST have `focus-visible:ring-*` styles
- Every form MUST have `autoComplete` on email/password fields
- Every async operation MUST have loading, error, and empty states
- Every animation MUST have a `motion-reduce` alternative
- Every touch target MUST be minimum 44px

**Design (anti-slop):**
- Read the project's globals.css/tailwind config BEFORE writing UI — use the project's actual tokens, not stock shadcn defaults
- Fonts must be loaded via `next/font` (or framework equivalent), not just declared in CSS
- Chart/graph colors: use raw HSL values from tokens, not `hsl(var(--x))` when the variable already contains `hsl(...)` — this produces invalid `hsl(hsl(...))`
- Cards must have visible elevation/distinction from background in BOTH light and dark mode
- Navigation needs icons alongside text labels — never text-only nav
- OAuth/social buttons need provider icons (GitHub octocat, Google G), not plain text
- Empty states need engaging visuals (illustration, icon + descriptive text), not just "No data yet"
- Landing pages need a visual hook above the fold (demo, screenshot, animation), not just text + subtitle
- Use the project's brand/accent color for emphasis, not stock primary

### Self-Critique (re-read diff before checks)

After writing code, before running typecheck, re-read your diff and ask:
1. Does every input have a label?
2. Does every fetch handle errors?
3. Does every async operation show a loading state?
4. Could any user-supplied value reach a dangerous sink (SQL, HTML, URL fetch)?
5. Are there any `as unknown as` casts that should be runtime-validated?
6. Would this work in dark mode? (Are colors from theme tokens, not hardcoded?)
7. Is every interactive element keyboard-accessible?
8. Does the UI have visual personality, or is it stock shadcn? (Check: distinctive colors, loaded fonts, icons in nav, non-generic empty states)

Fix issues found, then proceed to typecheck.

### Test Generation (for API/auth/data mutations)

When auto creates an API route, auth logic, hook, or data mutation, also write a test:

| Created | Write Test For |
|---------|---------------|
| API route | Happy path (200 + response shape) + missing auth (401) |
| Auth logic | Valid login + expired token + missing credentials |
| Hook | Initial state + success path + error path |
| Data mutation | Success + validation error + unauthorized |
| RLS policy | Authorized read + unauthorized read blocked |

Keep tests minimal (1-3 assertions each). Prioritize risky paths over easy-to-test pure functions.

### Acceptance Criteria & Verify Tags

When creating stories in prd.json (via audit, brainstorm, or bootstrap), include testable acceptance criteria and a `verify` array that tells auto which checks matter for this specific task:

```json
{
  "S13-001": {
    "title": "Fix SSRF in webhook endpoints",
    "verify": ["security", "test"],
    "acceptance": [
      "curl to http://169.254.169.254 from webhook returns 400",
      "curl to https://example.com from webhook returns 200"
    ],
    "passes": null
  },
  "S13-002": {
    "title": "Add dashboard page",
    "verify": ["visual", "a11y", "design"],
    "passes": null
  }
}
```

**Verify tag meanings:**

| Tag | What auto checks |
|-----|-----------------|
| `visual` | agent-browser screenshots desktop + mobile, no console errors |
| `a11y` | Labels on inputs, focus-visible rings, aria-labels, keyboard nav |
| `design` | Design token compliance check (see below) |
| `security` | Hardening check patterns (fail-open, unsafe casts, SSRF) |
| `auth` | Auth deny-by-default verified, middleware coverage |
| `test` | Write or verify a test for the critical path |
| `api` | curl with real params, verify 200 + response shape |

If no `verify` field exists, auto infers from the task type (UI → visual+a11y+design, API → api+security, etc.).

Before marking a task done, verify each acceptance criterion. "Does it compile?" is not acceptance — "does it behave correctly?" is.

### Context Loading (before writing any code)

1. Read 2-3 existing files most similar to what you're building
2. Identify patterns: naming conventions, import style, error handling, state management
3. Match patterns — do not introduce new patterns when existing ones cover the use case
4. **For UI tasks:** Read globals.css (or tailwind config) + layout.tsx to understand the project's design system — fonts, colors, component patterns. Use the project's ACTUAL tokens, not stock defaults. Check if fonts are loaded via `next/font` or just declared in CSS.

**Design context is not optional.** Auto-generated UI without reading the design system produces stock shadcn that fails the AI slop checklist. Spend 30 seconds reading the design tokens before writing any component.

### Verification

| Task Type | Verification |
|-----------|--------------|
| UX/UI (public pages) | agent-browser screenshots (desktop + mobile) + console errors |
| UX/UI (admin/internal) | typecheck + build only |
| Feature (UI) | Build passes + visual check if public UI changed + complete primary user flow once |
| Edge Function / API | Deploy + `curl` with real params + verify 200 + response shape matches expected |
| API Integration | Real request with real credentials + verify response contains expected data |
| Bug fix | Reproduce, verify fixed, no new errors |
| Refactor | Typecheck + build + existing tests pass + no behavior change |
| Auth / billing / RLS | Write or verify a test for the security-critical path |

**All task types also require the Hardening Check (step 4c).** This catches logic bugs that typecheck and build miss.

**Integration test is mandatory for API/Edge Function tasks.** Typecheck alone does not catch wrong API keys, wrong function signatures, or wrong database tables. Make one real request before marking done.

**Risk-shaped testing.** When adding tests, prioritize paths that handle money, access control, or user data over easy-to-test pure functions.

For UI/API tasks, detect or start a dev server first:
```bash
# Check if already running
for port in 3000 3001 5173 8080; do curl -s http://localhost:$port > /dev/null 2>&1 && break; done
# If none found, start one in background
Bash({ command: "npm run dev", run_in_background: true })
# Wait for startup, then verify
```

Use agent-browser (preferred — token efficient) or Playwright (more capabilities):

**agent-browser (preferred):**
```bash
agent-browser open http://localhost:3000/[page]
agent-browser snapshot -i          # Desktop screenshot + DOM
agent-browser viewport 375 812     # Switch to mobile
agent-browser snapshot -i          # Mobile screenshot
agent-browser errors               # Console errors
```

**Playwright fallback (if agent-browser unavailable):**
```bash
npx playwright screenshot http://localhost:3000/[page] .claude/screenshots/page-desktop.png
npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size=375,812 http://localhost:3000/[page] .claude/screenshots/page-mobile.png
```

If neither is available, fall back to `WebFetch` or `curl` for basic page load verification.

Analyze screenshots for: broken layout, missing content, visual regressions, design quality, dark mode correctness.
Fix console errors or visual issues before marking task complete.

### Self-Verification (after each task)

Before marking any task as complete:

**1. Type Safety**
```bash
npm run typecheck 2>/dev/null || npx tsc --noEmit 2>/dev/null
```

**2. Tests**
```bash
npm test -- --passWithNoTests --watchAll=false 2>/dev/null
```

**3. Resource Validation**
If the task added external resources (images, fonts, API URLs), validate them:
```bash
# Check image/asset URLs are reachable
grep -rn 'https://.*\.(png|jpg|svg|webp|woff2)' src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | while read line; do
  url=$(echo "$line" | grep -oP 'https://[^\s"'\'']+'); curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} $url\n" "$url"
done
```
Fix broken URLs before committing — they cause blank images and layout shifts in production.

**4. Self-Review**
Run `git diff` and check: no `console.log`/`debugger`, no hardcoded colors, all UI states handled, no `any` types, no commented-out code.

**4b. Sweeping Change Verification**
If the task involved a bulk find-and-replace (e.g., renaming, migrating values, swapping imports), grep for the OLD pattern to confirm it's fully eliminated. Partial migrations cause subtle bugs (e.g., USD→EUR migration that missed one pricing page).

**4c. Hardening Check (per-task audit-lite)**
Review the diff for these patterns in the files you just changed. Fix before marking done:

| Pattern | What to Check | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Fail-open auth** | `if (secret && ...)` skips auth when env var is unset | Fail-closed: return 401 if env var missing |
| **Unsafe casts** | `as unknown as`, `as any`, double assertions | Create a validator (Zod or manual), parse instead of cast |
| **Fire-and-forget fetch** | `fetch()` without try/catch or `.ok` check | Wrap in try/catch, check `res.ok`, revert optimistic state on failure |
| **Missing form labels** | `<input placeholder="...">` without `<label>` or `aria-label` | Add `<label>` or `aria-label` to every input |
| **Missing autocomplete** | Login/signup inputs without `autoComplete` | Add `autoComplete="email"`, `autoComplete="current-password"`, etc. |
| **User-supplied URLs** | Server-side `fetch(userUrl)` without validation | Validate URL, resolve DNS, block private IP ranges |
| **Env var fallbacks** | `process.env.X \|\| 'localhost'` or `\|\| ''` | Throw if missing in production, only fallback in dev |
| **RLS policy logic** | New table or RLS change | Verify policy restricts to `auth.uid()` for user data |
| **Missing focus styles** | Raw `<button>` without `focus-visible:ring-*` | Add `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring` |
| **Stock UI** | Fonts declared but not loaded, text-only nav, generic empty states | Load fonts via next/font, add icons, add visual personality |
| **Dark mode** | Colors that don't use theme tokens, cards same color as background | Use semantic tokens, add elevation distinction |
| **Chart colors** | `hsl(var(--x))` when var already contains `hsl(...)` | Use raw HSL values or remove outer `hsl()` wrapper |

Only check patterns relevant to the files you changed — this is a 30-second scan of your own diff, not a full audit.

**5. Design Token Compliance (UI tasks only)**
If the task changed `.tsx` or `.css` files, verify the output uses the project's actual tokens:
```bash
# Check for stock shadcn / hardcoded colors in changed files
git diff --name-only | xargs grep -n "text-white\|bg-black\|text-gray-\|bg-gray-\|#[0-9a-fA-F]\{6\}" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "gradient\|from-\|to-\|via-" | head -10
# Check fonts are loaded, not just declared
grep -rn "fontFamily\|font-family" src/ --include="*.css" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "next/font\|@font-face\|tailwind" | head -5
```
If stock colors or unloaded fonts found in YOUR changes, fix before proceeding.

**6. UI/API Change? Visual Verification**
Run agent-browser or Playwright screenshots from the Verification section above. Not optional for UI tasks.

**7. Mark Complete**
Only after all checks pass. UI files (.tsx, .css, layout, page) without visual verification → go back to step 6.

## Smart Retry

On failure:
1. **Auto-fix first** — Most failures are trivial (missing import, type mismatch, wrong path). Read the error, fix it inline, re-run the check. This does not count as a retry.
2. Retry 1: Different approach
4. Retry 2: Simplest possible implementation
5. Still fails: set `passes: false`, continue to next task
6. If failure is due to missing external setup (API keys, services, infrastructure): set `passes: "needs-setup"` with `blockedReason` explaining what's needed. This distinguishes "can't do yet" from "tried and failed."

Do not retry a third time. Do not spend more than 10 minutes on retries for a single task.

### Error Pattern Recognition

Track error types across tasks. When the same error pattern appears 3+ times:
1. Save it to auto-memory as a known pattern with its fix recipe
2. On future occurrences, apply the fix immediately without the auto-fix→retry cycle

Common patterns to recognize:
| Error Pattern | Instant Fix |
|--------------|-------------|
| `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` error | Add `\| undefined` to optional prop types: `foo?: string \| undefined` |
| `Cannot find module './X'` | Check file exists, fix path or create file |
| `Type 'X' is not assignable to type 'Y'` | Check the type definition, add union or cast |
| `Property 'X' does not exist on type 'Y'` | Add to interface or use optional chaining |
| `RLS policy violation` | Check auth.uid() in policy, verify user is authenticated |
| `CORS error` | Check API route headers or middleware config |
| `as unknown as` cast | Create a validator function, parse instead of assert |
| Unhandled fetch in component | Wrap in try/catch, check res.ok, add error feedback |
| `<input>` without label | Add `<label htmlFor>` or `aria-label` prop |
| Env var `\|\| ''` fallback | Throw if missing, fallback only with NODE_ENV check |
| Middleware blocks new route | Add to PUBLIC_PREFIXES or route matcher |
| Font declared but not loaded | Add `next/font` import in layout.tsx |
| `hsl(var(--x))` double-wrap | Remove outer `hsl()` when CSS var already contains it |
| Stock shadcn tokens | Read project's globals.css, use actual brand colors |

## Commit Cadence

- Commit every 3 completed tasks
- Or after major milestones
- Feature branch for team projects; main is fine for solo (see commit skill)
- Use conventional commits: `feat|fix|refactor`

## Save Project Knowledge (Continuous Learning)

After solving hard problems (debugging, retries, unexpected errors), save reusable lessons to auto-memory:

| What to Save | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Environment quirks** | "This project uses Vite on port 5173, not CRA on 3000" |
| **Error fix recipes** | "RLS 'permission denied' → check auth.uid() in policy, not custom function" |
| **Architecture patterns** | "API routes follow /api/v1/[resource]/route.ts pattern" |
| **Build gotchas** | "Must run `npm run generate` before build (Prisma client)" |
| **Test setup** | "Tests need `TEST_DB_URL` env var, seed with `npm run seed:test`" |
| **Deploy requirements** | "Vercel needs `ANALYZE=true` for bundle analysis" |

Also save after these events:
- **Same error 3+ times across tasks** → save as known pattern with fix recipe
- **Unexpected project structure** → save the actual structure for next session
- **Workarounds discovered** → save so next session doesn't rediscover them

This builds per-project context that compounds across sessions.

## Token Management

With 1M context, compaction is almost never needed. Do NOT suggest `/compact` unless you are certain context usage exceeds 70%. A full sprint (10+ tasks) typically uses only 15-20% of 1M context.

Be concise but don't sacrifice clarity for brevity.

## Auto-Deploy (After Commit)

After committing completed tasks, check if changed files need deployment:

```bash
# Check what changed since last deploy/commit
git diff --name-only HEAD~1
```

| Changed Files | Deploy Action |
|--------------|---------------|
| `supabase/functions/*/index.ts` | Deploy changed edge functions (read deploy command from project CLAUDE.md) |
| `supabase/migrations/*.sql` | Run `supabase db push` or apply migration |
| `src/**` (Vercel/Next.js) | Push to trigger Vercel auto-deploy |

For edge functions, read project-specific deploy config from CLAUDE.md (e.g., path to supabase binary, project ref, flags like `--no-verify-jwt`). If no config found, skip auto-deploy and note it in completion summary.

After deploy, verify the deployment succeeded (check endpoint responds with 200).

## Completion

When all stories have `passes === true`:

```
All [N] tasks complete.

Summary:
- [X] features implemented
- [X] bugs fixed
- [X] improvements made

Run `progress` to see full results.
```

## IDLE Detection (Smart Next Action)

If no tasks to work on:
1. Are all stories `passes: true`?
   - No: find blocked tasks and resolve blockers
   - Yes: continue to step 2
2. **Auto-transition sprint** (see below)
3. Output completion summary
4. Assess context to decide next action

### Auto Sprint Transition

When all pending tasks are done, auto handles the sprint lifecycle — never ask the user to do this manually:

```
1. Log summary to .claude/sprint-history.md:
   "Sprint [N]: [done]/[total] tasks | [date] | [one-line summary of work]"

2. Archive completed stories:
   - Copy current prd.json to .claude/archives/prd-archive-sprint-[N].json
   - Remove stories with passes: true from prd.json
   - Keep stories with passes: null, false, or "deferred"

3. If new work exists (audit findings, brainstorm stories, deferred tasks):
   - Bump sprint number in prd.json
   - Continue executing immediately

4. If no work remains:
   - Ask user (see below)
```

### Decision Matrix

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Deferred tasks from previous sprint | Carry forward, start working |
| Audit/brainstorm created new stories | Bump sprint, continue |
| Dev server running + UI changes made | Run visual scan, fix issues found |
| TODOs/FIXMEs in changed files | Create stories, fix them |
| Build warnings | Fix directly (no story needed) |
| Clean codebase, no work | Ask user (see below) |

### Auto-Continue (Obvious Work)

When new work exists after sprint transition, continue immediately:
```
Sprint [N] complete ([done]/[total] tasks).
Archived completed stories. [M] tasks carried forward.
Continuing as Sprint [N+1].
```

Limit: 2 auto-continued sprints per session. After that, ask the user.

### Ask User (No Obvious Work or Limit Reached)

If the sprint had 5+ tasks, suggest simplify first:
```
Sprint [N] complete ([done]/[total] tasks).

Recommended: run `simplify` to catch duplicate code from this sprint.

What's next?
1. simplify - Review for duplicate code and over-abstraction
2. audit - Deep quality scan (finds bugs + violations)
3. brainstorm - Feature ideas + dead code scan
4. Done for now
```

Keep `.claude/auto-active` flag while asking. Only delete it if user picks "Done for now".

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No prd.json | Bootstrap from context |
| All done + issues found | Brainstorm (auto-creates stories) |
| All done + clean code | Ask user for next action |
| All done + already auto-sprinted | Ask user (limit reached) |
| Build broken | Fix first |
| Task fails | Retry 2x, then skip |
| UX task | Browser verify |
| Blocked task | Skip, work on unblocked |
| < 5 tasks, no sprint | Work directly |
