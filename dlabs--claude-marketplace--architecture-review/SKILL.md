name: architecture-review
description: Multi-agent architecture review combining core architecture design with parallel security, performance, and data integrity assessments. Produces ADRs in MADR format. Covers ADR, architecture decision, system design, scalability assessment. Not for code review or implementation — for architectural decisions only. Use when this capability is needed.

# Architecture Review

This skill provides a comprehensive architecture review using a parallel agent team. The architecture-strategist designs the core architecture, while security-sentinel, performance-oracle, and data-integrity-guardian independently evaluate their respective concerns.

## When to Use

- `/blueprint-dev:bp:architect` — full architecture review
- Before implementing significant features or system changes
- When making technology or pattern decisions that affect the system long-term

## Agent Team

| Agent | Focus | Runs |
|-------|-------|------|
| architecture-strategist | Core design, patterns, ADR authoring | First (produces the design) |
| security-sentinel | OWASP, auth, injection, XSS | Parallel with others |
| performance-oracle | N+1, caching, bottlenecks, scaling | Parallel with others |
| data-integrity-guardian | Schema, migrations, constraints, transactions | Parallel with others |

## Flow

```
architecture-strategist (design)
    ↓
[security-sentinel | performance-oracle | data-integrity-guardian] (parallel review)
    ↓
Merged assessment with ADR
```

## ADR Format

Uses MADR (Markdown Any Decision Records). See `references/adr-format.md`.

## Architecture Patterns

See `references/patterns-catalog.md` for common patterns the strategist considers.

## Key Principles

1. **Appropriate complexity** — the simplest architecture that meets requirements
2. **Document trade-offs** — every decision has pros and cons
3. **ADRs are permanent** — once accepted, superseded but not deleted
4. **Parallel review** — security, performance, and data integrity are independent concerns
