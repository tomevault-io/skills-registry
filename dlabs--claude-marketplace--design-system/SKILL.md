# Design System

This skill provides the complete lifecycle for code-first design exploration. Variants are standalone HTML files — not mockups or prototypes — that open directly in any browser. Tokens extracted from chosen variants persist across sessions, creating a consistent design language. An optional brand discovery phase builds a coherent visual identity before exploration begins.

## Lifecycle

```
PRODUCT PLANNING (/ds:product, /ds:data-shape, /ds:shell, /ds:section)
    → SECTION DESIGN (per section) (/ds:section design, /ds:section pick)
    → BRAND (optional) (/ds:brand)
    → EXPLORE (/ds:design)
        → refine loop (/ds:design-refine)
    → DECIDE (/ds:design-pick)
    → SHIP (/ds:design-ship)
```

### Pre. PRODUCT PLANNING (recommended)

Define what you're building before exploring how it looks. See `skills/product-planning/SKILL.md` for the full product planning lifecycle.

Commands: `/ds:product` → `/ds:data-shape` → `/ds:shell` → `/ds:section`

Outputs:
- `.design/product/product-overview.md` — Product name, description, problems, features
- `.design/product/product-roadmap.md` — Ordered section list
- `.design/product/data-shape/data-shape.md` — Data entities and relationships
- `.design/product/shell/spec.md` — App shell, navigation, layout
- `.design/product/sections/{id}/spec.md` — Feature section specs

### 0a. SECTION DESIGN (per section)

After product planning defines section specs, design each section's screens. This bridges specs (what to build) with visual design (how it looks).

`/design-studio:ds:section design "Section" "screen"` uses the **screen-designer** agent to create 3 HTML screen variants:
- Each variant includes app shell chrome (sidebar, top bar) from the shell spec
- Content is driven by the section spec's user flows and UI requirements
- Variants differ in layout, interaction pattern, or information hierarchy
- CSS custom properties enable consistent design language across screens

`/design-studio:ds:section pick "Section" "screen" <letter>` selects a variant:
- Copies chosen variant to `screen-designs/{screen-name}.html`
- Archives rejected variants to `.drafts/{screen-name}/rejected/`

Section design outputs:
- `.design/product/sections/{id}/screen-designs/{screen}.html` — picked screen designs
- `.design/product/sections/{id}/screen-designs/.drafts/{screen}/` — variant drafts with manifest

See `references/screen-design-spec.md` for the screen design HTML boilerplate, manifest schema, and quality rules.

### 0b. BRAND (optional)

`/design-studio:ds:brand` uses the **brand-builder** agent to create a Minimum Viable Brand through interactive Q&A:
- Batched questions (2-3 per round) about business, audience, personality, and visual direction
- Reference gathering — analyze URLs (WebFetch) and images (multimodal) for visual patterns
- Synthesis into `brand.json` — full identity including personality, voice, visual principles, and visual tokens
- Derives `tokens.json` from brand (locked with `source_brand: true`)
- Generates `brand-guide.html` — standalone style reference using the brand's own tokens

After brand discovery, the **brand-showcase-generator** agent creates 2-3 HTML showcase pages demonstrating the brand in real page contexts (landing page, pricing, features, etc.).

Brand outputs:
- `.design/brand.json` — full brand identity (source of truth)
- `.design/tokens.json` — derived visual tokens (auto-locked)
- `.design/brand-guide.html` — visual style guide
- `.design/brand-showcase/` — showcase pages with manifest

### 1. EXPLORE

`/design-studio:ds:design` uses the **variant-generator** agent to create 3-4 standalone HTML files. Each variant:
- Is a self-contained `.html` file with Tailwind CDN — no build step
- Differs in layout, weight, hierarchy, or interaction pattern
- Uses CSS custom properties for all design values (enables token extraction)
- Respects locked tokens from previous sessions as constraints

### 1b. REFINE (optional, repeatable)

After picking a variant, iterate on it with feedback. `/design-studio:ds:design-refine "feedback"` uses the **variant-generator** agent in refinement mode:
- Reads the picked `chosen.html` as the base design
- Creates a new session with 3-4 variants that interpret the feedback differently
- Preserves elements not mentioned in the feedback
- Each refinement creates a parent→child chain tracked in manifests

Refinement loop:
```
EXPLORE (/ds:design) → pick → REFINE (/ds:design-refine) → pick → REFINE → ... → DECIDE
```

The refinement manifest includes `parent_session`, `parent_variant`, and `refinement_prompt` fields for chain tracking.

### 2. DECIDE

`/design-studio:ds:design-pick` uses the **token-extractor** agent to:
- Parse the chosen variant's `:root {}` CSS custom properties
- Categorize tokens into colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows
- Write `tokens.json` to `.design/tokens.json`
- Archive rejected variants and keep `chosen.html`

### 3. SHIP

`/design-studio:ds:design-ship` uses the **nextjs-converter** agent to:
- Read `chosen.html` + `tokens.json`
- Scan project conventions (App Router, component patterns, naming)
- Detect installed component libraries (shadcn/ui, Radix UI) and utilities (`cn()`, cva)
- Convert to production Next.js components using detected libraries (e.g., `<Button>`, `<Card>`, `<Tabs>` from shadcn/ui) with proper TypeScript types
- Extend `tailwind.config.ts` with design tokens if needed

## Key Principles

- **Standalone HTML**: Variants must open in any browser with zero setup. Tailwind CDN, inline JS, no external deps beyond CDN links.
- **CSS custom properties as the source of truth**: Every color, spacing value, font, radius, and shadow must be a CSS custom property in `:root {}`. This is what makes token extraction work.
- **Meaningful differentiation**: Variants must differ in layout, interaction, hierarchy, or density — not just color swaps or font changes.
- **Token persistence**: Once tokens are locked via `/ds:design-pick`, future `/ds:design` runs use them as constraints. Variants share the visual language but explore different structures.
- **Convention-following**: Ship phase reads the existing project and matches its patterns — including component libraries like shadcn/ui — never invents new conventions.
