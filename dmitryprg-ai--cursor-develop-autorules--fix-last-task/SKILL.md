# Fix Last Task Protocol

Principle: **ANALYZE FAILURE BEFORE FIXING.**

## When to Apply

- AI declared task complete, but user found errors
- Challenge protocol or Cross-check were not performed properly
- Completion report had high confidence but result is wrong

## Workflow (7 Phases — ALL MANDATORY)

### Phase 1: ANALYZE FAILURE
1. Restore original request (exact quote)
2. List what was done vs what was expected
3. Re-run Challenge protocol from `core-master.mdc` (Cross-check + 4 questions)
4. List all missed issues

### Phase 2: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
Apply 5 Whys from `_base-5wh.mdc` — dig at least 5 levels to find why the issues were missed.

### Phase 3: PLAN
Create TODO list — one item per missed issue, starting with critical ones.

### Phase 4: FIX
For each TODO:
1. Mark in_progress
2. Apply fix
3. Cross-check: open file, read changes, verify
4. Mark completed
5. Report confidence change: `[before]% → [after]% — [reason]`

### Phase 5: VERIFY
Apply Cross-check (open every changed file) + Final Challenge (4 questions).

### Phase 6: SESSION REVIEW
Apply `session-review` skill fully. Record improvement to `.cursor/data/improvements-backlog.md`.

### Phase 7: COMPLETION REPORT
Full DONE block with: issues found, fixes applied, root cause, improvement recorded, final confidence.

## FORBIDDEN

- Skipping any Phase
- Fixing without Cross-check
- Not recording improvement in backlog
- Declaring done without re-running Challenge
- Making excuses instead of analyzing
