name: refactoring
description: Improve code structure without changing behavior. Use when refactoring, cleaning up, optimizing, simplifying, extracting methods, or reducing complexity. Requires tests BEFORE refactoring, small steps, commit after each green test. Use when this capability is needed.

# Refactoring Protocol

Principle: **CHANGE STRUCTURE, NOT BEHAVIOR.**

If behavior changes, it's NOT refactoring -- it's a feature or bugfix.

## When to Refactor

| Refactor When | Do NOT When |
|---------------|-------------|
| Code works but hard to understand | Code doesn't work yet |
| Duplicated code | No tests exist |
| Long methods (> 50 lines) | Under time pressure |
| Deep nesting (> 3 levels) | "Just because" |

## Safety Protocol

1. Tests MUST exist before refactoring
2. Tests MUST pass before each change
3. Only small steps (one change at a time)
4. Run tests AFTER each change
5. Commit AFTER each green test

## Workflow

```
1. VERIFY   -> All tests pass
2. IDENTIFY -> What to refactor
3. PREPLAN  -> Check file size limits (standard-file-size-limits rule)
4. PLAN     -> Small steps
5. EXECUTE  -> One step
6. TEST     -> Tests after step
7. COMMIT   -> Commit if green
8. REPEAT   -> Next step
```

## Common Patterns

| Code Smell | Refactoring |
|------------|-------------|
| Long Method (> 50 lines) | Extract Method |
| Duplicate Code | Extract Method/Class |
| Long Parameter List (> 4) | Parameter Object |
| Deep Nesting (> 3 levels) | Guard Clauses |
| Magic Numbers | Extract Constant |

## Anti-patterns (FORBIDDEN)

- Big Bang: rewriting entire module at once
- No Tests: refactoring without test coverage
- Mixed Changes: "while I'm here, let me fix this bug too"
- Premature Abstraction: abstraction for code used once

## Golden Rules

1. **TESTS FIRST** -- no tests, no refactoring
2. **SMALL STEPS** -- one change at a time
3. **TEST OFTEN** -- after every change
4. **COMMIT OFTEN** -- after every green test
5. **BEHAVIOR UNCHANGED** -- same inputs -> same outputs
