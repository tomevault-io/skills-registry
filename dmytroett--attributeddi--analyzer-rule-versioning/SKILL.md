# Version Analyzer Releases

Update `src/AttributedDI.SourceGenerator/AnalyzerReleases.Unshipped.md` for every analyzer change (add/remove/change). "Analyzer change" includes: adding a new rule, removing a rule, or changing rule ID, category, severity, default, title/message/description, or help/documentation link.

- Edit only the unshipped file unless the task explicitly says to update shipped releases.
- Keep the exact section headers and table headers as they are in the file.
- Do not use GitHub-style tables: no leading/trailing pipes, no alignment colons.
- Preserve the dashed separator row style exactly.
- Rule IDs must start with ATTDI (for example ATTDI001, ATTDI002).
- New rule IDs must be monotonically increasing across shipped and unshipped analyzers.
- Only include sections that have at least one row. Place each change under the correct section (New/Changed/Removed)
- If the rule is removed, it must appear in “Removed Rules” section.
- If category/severity/notes for the rule were changed, a row must be added to “Changed Rules” section. Both new and old columns should be filled with corresponding values.
- Sort rows by Rule ID within each section.
- Allowed severity values: Hidden, Info, Warning, Error.
- Notes should be a short summary of the rule. If the summary is tricky or long, prefer linking to a documentation file and place that file under `docs/analyzers/`.
- If multiple changes happen to the same rule while unshipped, keep a single row that reflects the final state. The last change wins; e.g., a changed-then-removed rule should appear only under “Removed Rules.”

Template (format only; replace with real values). Include only the sections you need.
