# Slop Scan - Code Quality Analysis

Runs Slop Bot analysis on the codebase and reports findings. Use before `slop_fix` to identify fixable issues.

## Inputs

| Input | Type | Default | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `codebase_path` | string | "" | Path to analyze (default: current workspace) |
| `max_parallel` | int | 3 | Maximum concurrent analysis loops |

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Workspace Path
- Use `codebase_path` if provided, else current workspace root (e.g. `/home/daoneill/src/redhat-ai-workflow`)

### 2. Run Slop Analysis
- From workspace root, run:
  ```bash
  python -m services.slop --max-parallel 3 --codebase <path>
  ```
- Timeout: 30 minutes
- On success: show stdout. On failure: show stderr. On timeout: report "Analysis timed out"

### 3. Get Statistics
- If `~/.config/aa-workflow/slop.db` exists, query:
  - `SELECT 'Total findings: ' || COUNT(*) FROM findings WHERE status = 'open';`
  - `SELECT severity, COUNT(*) FROM findings WHERE status = 'open' GROUP BY severity;`
  - `SELECT loop, COUNT(*) FROM findings WHERE status = 'open' GROUP BY loop;`
- Use `sqlite_query` (aa_sqlite) or `sqlite3` CLI if no MCP tool loaded
- If DB missing: report "No Slop database found. Run analysis first."

### 4. Log Session
- `memory_session_log("Slop scan completed", "Analyzed <workspace_path>")`

### 5. Output Format

```markdown
## Slop Bot Analysis Complete

### Analysis Result
<analysis_result>

### Statistics
<stats_output>

---
View findings in VSCode or query the database at `~/.config/aa-workflow/slop.db`
```

## Key Details

- **Chains to:** `slop_fix` - fix issues found by scan
- **Provides context for:** `review_local_changes`, `create_mr`
- Slop service must be available: `services.slop` module
