# PM Beads Plan (Strict)

## Current Phase
- **BEADS PLANNING** (and then **AWAITING BEADS APPROVAL**)

## Purpose
Convert an **APPROVED** PRD into an executable Beads graph:
- 1 Epic per PRD
- Atomic child tasks with Definition of Done (DoD)
- Explicit dependencies (`blocks` / `blocked-by`)
- Human review gate before implementation starts

## Paired Support Agents (recommended)
Before locking the task graph, proactively consult:
1. **Senior Engineer** for dependency correctness and implementation sequencing.
2. **Librarian** for external constraints (API quotas, platform requirements, compliance notes).
3. **Smoke Test Planner output** from discovery/PRD for QA task coverage.

## Preconditions (hard gate)
Before planning, verify all of the following:
1. PRD path is provided and file exists.
2. User explicitly confirms PRD is approved.
3. PRD `Open Questions` section is empty.

If any precondition fails:
- **STOP**.
- State exactly what is missing.
- Ask only for the missing prerequisite(s).
- Do not generate epic/tasks/dependencies yet.

## Planning Rules
When preconditions pass:
- Ensure Beads is initialized (`bd init`) if `.beads/` is missing.
- Epic title format:
  - `<slug> (PRD: <path>)`
- Generate atomic tasks only:
  - each task independently completable
  - no vague "misc/refactor/fix later" tasks
- Each task must include:
  - clear scope
  - DoD (testable)
- Dependencies must be explicit:
  - define `blocks` / `blocked-by` relationships with `bd dep`
- Include a dedicated `Manual QA Smoke Tests` task in the epic:
  - consumes the discovery/PRD smoke-test plan
  - runs happy/unhappy/regression checks
  - includes browser-based smoke checks when needed

## bdui Review Gate (required)
After task graph is generated:
- Present [bdui](https://github.com/assimelha/bdui) as the primary visual review.
- If `bdui` is available, instruct to launch it from repo root.
- Always provide fallback list view:
  - `bd list --parent <epic-id> --pretty`
  - `bd graph <epic-id> --compact`
- Require explicit user response `approved` before implementation.

## Handoff to Implementation
When user responds `approved` at this gate:
- Automatically invoke `$pm-implement` with PRD path and epic ID.
- Do not ask the user to manually run the next command.
- Preferred orchestration path: invoke via `spawn_agent` and wait for completion.

## Minimal Repo Bootstrap (only if needed)
- Ensure `docs/beads.md` exists.
- If missing, create it with these conventions:
  - PRD slug format: `YYYY-MM-DD--kebab-slug`
  - Epic naming includes slug + PRD path
  - Atomic tasks + DoD + explicit deps
  - `.beads/` should be committed to git

## Output Requirements (every run)
Always include these sections, in order:
1. `Current phase: BEADS PLANNING` or `Current phase: AWAITING BEADS APPROVAL`
2. `PRD path`
3. `Epic name`
4. `Task list (with DoD)`
5. `Dependency list`
6. `Human-readable task graph`
7. `bdui review` (with repo link + fallback commands)
8. `What I need from you next`

## Invocation
- Trigger strongly on `$pm-beads-plan <request>`.
- Expect PRD path and approval confirmation.
