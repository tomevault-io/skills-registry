# Prompt Architect

A comprehensive framework for creating, analyzing, and refining prompts for AI language models using evidence-based techniques, structural optimization principles, and systematic anti-pattern detection.

## Overview

Prompt Architect provides a systematic approach to prompt engineering that combines research-backed techniques with practical experience. Whether crafting prompts for Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or other systems, this skill applies proven patterns that consistently produce high-quality responses.

This skill is particularly valuable for developing prompts used repeatedly, troubleshooting prompts that aren't performing well, building prompt templates for teams, or optimizing high-stakes tasks where prompt quality significantly impacts outcomes.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply Prompt Architect when:
- Creating new prompts for AI systems that will be used repeatedly or programmatically
- Improving existing prompts that produce inconsistent or suboptimal results
- Building prompt libraries or templates for team use
- Teaching others about effective prompt engineering
- Working on complex tasks where prompt quality substantially impacts outcomes
- Debugging why a prompt isn't working as expected

This skill focuses on prompts as engineered artifacts rather than casual conversational queries. The assumption is you're creating prompts that provide compounding value through repeated or systematic use.

## Core Prompt Analysis Framework

When analyzing existing prompts, apply systematic evaluation across these dimensions:

### Intent and Clarity Assessment

Evaluate whether the prompt clearly communicates its core objective. Ask:
- Could someone unfamiliar with context understand what task is being requested?
- Are success criteria explicit or must the AI infer what constitutes a good response?
- Is there ambiguous phrasing that could be interpreted multiple ways?
- Does the prompt state its goal unambiguously?

Strong prompts leave minimal room for misinterpretation of their central purpose.

### Structural Organization Analysis

Evaluate how the prompt is organized:
- Does critical information appear at the beginning and end where attention is highest?
- Are clear delimiters used to separate different types of information?
- Is there hierarchical structure for complex multi-part tasks?
- Does organization make the prompt easy to parse for both humans and AI?

Effective structure guides the AI naturally through the task.

### Context Sufficiency Evaluation

Determine whether adequate context is provided:
- Are there implied assumptions about background knowledge?
- Are constraints, requirements, and edge cases explicitly stated?
- Does the prompt specify audience, purpose, and contextual factors?
- Is necessary background information included or assumed?

Strong prompts make required context explicit rather than assuming shared understanding.

### Technique Application Review

Assess whether appropriate evidence-based techniques are employed:
- For analytical tasks: Are self-consistency mechanisms present?
- For numerical/logical problems: Is program-of-thought structure used?
- For complex multi-stage tasks: Is plan-and-solve framework present?
- Are techniques appropriate to the task type?

Different task categories benefit from different prompting patterns.

### Failure Mode Detection

Examine for common anti-patterns:
- Vague instructions that allow excessive interpretation
- Contradictory requirements
- Over-complexity that confuses rather than clarifies
- Insufficient edge case handling
- Assumptions that may not hold across all expected uses

Identify what could go wrong and whether guardrails exist.

### Formatting and Accessibility

Evaluate presentation quality:
- Do delimiters clearly separate instructions from data?
- Does visual hierarchy aid understanding?
- Is whitespace, headers, and structure used effectively?
- Is the prompt accessible to both AI systems and human maintainers?

Good formatting enhances both machine and human comprehension.

## Prompt Refinement Methodology

When improving prompts, follow this systematic approach:

### 1. Clarify Core Intent First

Begin by ensuring the central task is crystal clear:
- Rewrite primary instruction using specific action verbs
- Replace abstract requests with concrete operations
- Add quantifiable parameters where appropriate
- Make success criteria explicit

A refined prompt should leave no doubt about its fundamental purpose.

### 2. Restructure for Attention and Flow

Apply structural optimization:
- Move critical instructions and constraints to beginning and end
- Organize complex prompts hierarchically
- Use formatting and delimiters to create visual structure
- Ensure logical progression through the task

Each section should build naturally on previous ones.

### 3. Add Necessary Context

Enrich prompts with previously implicit or missing context:
- Specify audience, purpose, and situational factors
- Define ambiguous terms or concepts
- Establish constraints and requirements explicitly
- Provide background needed to understand task significance

Make assumptions explicit rather than hidden.

### 4. Apply Evidence-Based Techniques

Incorporate research-validated patterns:
- **Self-Consistency**: For factual/analytical tasks, request validation from multiple perspectives
- **Program-of-Thought**: For logical tasks, structure step-by-step explicit reasoning
- **Plan-and-Solve**: For complex workflows, separate planning from execution
- **Few-Shot Examples**: Provide concrete examples of desired input-output patterns
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Request explicit reasoning steps for complex problems

Match techniques to task requirements.

### 5. Build in Quality Mechanisms

Add self-checking and validation:
- Include verification steps in multi-stage processes
- Specify quality criteria for outputs
- Request explicit uncertainty acknowledgment when appropriate
- Build in sanity checks for analytical tasks

Quality mechanisms increase reliability and reduce errors.

### 6. Address Edge Cases and Failure Modes

Anticipate and handle potential problems:
- Identify likely edge cases and specify handling
- Include fallback strategies for error conditions
- Use negative examples to illustrate what to avoid
- Make explicit any assumptions that might not hold

Proactive edge case handling prevents common failures.

### 7. Optimize Output Specification

Be explicit about desired output format:
- Specify structure (prose, JSON, bullet points, etc.)
- Define required components and their order
- Indicate appropriate length or detail level
- Clarify how to handle uncertainty or incomplete information

Clear output specification prevents format ambiguity.

## Evidence-Based Prompting Techniques

### Self-Consistency

For tasks requiring factual accuracy or analytical rigor, instruct the AI to:
- Consider multiple perspectives or approaches
- Validate conclusions against available evidence
- Flag areas of uncertainty explicitly
- Cross-check reasoning for internal consistency

Example addition to prompt: "After reaching your conclusion, validate it by considering alternative interpretations of the evidence. Flag any areas where uncertainty exists."

### Program-of-Thought

For mathematical, logical, or step-by-step problem-solving tasks:
- Structure prompts to encourage explicit step-by-step thinking
- Request showing work and intermediate steps
- Break complex operations into clear substeps
- Have the AI explain its reasoning at each stage

Example structure: "Solve this problem step by step. For each step, explain your reasoning before moving to the next step. Show all intermediate calculations."

### Plan-and-Solve

For complex multi-stage workflows:
- Separate planning phase from execution phase
- Request explicit plan before beginning work
- Build in verification after completion
- Structure as: Plan → Execute → Verify

Example structure: "First, create a detailed plan for how you'll approach this task. Then execute the plan systematically. Finally, verify your results against the original requirements."

### Few-Shot Examples

For tasks with specific desired patterns:
- Provide 2-5 concrete examples showing input-output pairs
- Ensure examples are representative of the task variety
- Include edge cases in examples if they're important
- Use consistent formatting across examples

Example pattern:
```
Here are examples of the desired format:

Input: [example 1 input]
Output: [example 1 output]

Input: [example 2 input]
Output: [example 2 output]

Now process: [actual input]
```

### Chain-of-Thought

For complex reasoning tasks:
- Request explicit reasoning steps
- Ask AI to show its thinking process
- Have AI explain why it reached particular conclusions
- Build in self-reflection on reasoning quality

Example addition: "Think through this step by step, explaining your reasoning at each stage. After reaching your conclusion, reflect on whether your reasoning was sound."

## Structural Optimization Principles

### Context Positioning

Critical information receives more attention when placed strategically:
- **Beginning**: State the core task and most critical constraints
- **End**: Reinforce key requirements and output format
- **Middle**: Provide supporting details, background, and examples

This leverages how attention is distributed across prompts.

### Hierarchical Organization

For complex prompts, use clear hierarchy:
- Top level: Overall task and goals
- Second level: Major components or phases
- Third level: Specific instructions and details
- Use headers, numbering, or formatting to make hierarchy visible

Hierarchy prevents information overload and aids navigation.

### Delimiter Strategy

Use clear delimiters to separate different types of content:
- Triple backticks for code or data: ```data here```
- XML-style tags for sections: <context>...</context>
- Headers and whitespace for visual separation
- Consistent delimiter usage throughout the prompt

Delimiters prevent ambiguity about where instructions end and data begins.

### Length Management

Balance comprehensiveness with parsability:
- Short prompts (<200 words): Fine for simple, well-defined tasks
- Medium prompts (200-800 words): Appropriate for most complex tasks
- Long prompts (>800 words): Use hierarchical structure and progressive detail
- Consider splitting extremely long prompts into multi-turn interactions

Longer isn't always better—optimize for clarity and necessity.

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Vague Instructions

Problem: Instructions that allow excessive interpretation
- "Analyze this data" (analyze how? for what purpose?)
- "Make it better" (better in what way? by what criteria?)

Solution: Use specific action verbs and concrete objectives
- "Analyze this dataset to identify trends in user engagement, focusing on weekly patterns and demographic segments"

### Contradictory Requirements

Problem: Instructions that conflict with each other
- "Be comprehensive but keep it brief"
- "Include all details but summarize"

Solution: Prioritize requirements explicitly
- "Provide a brief executive summary (200 words) followed by detailed sections on each key finding"

### Over-Complexity

Problem: Prompts so intricate they confuse rather than clarify
- Multiple nested conditions and exceptions
- Excessive special cases and qualifications

Solution: Simplify structure, use examples instead of complex rules
- Replace complex conditional logic with clear examples showing desired behavior

### Insufficient Context

Problem: Assuming shared understanding that doesn't exist
- References to "the usual format" without defining it
- Assumptions about domain knowledge

Solution: Make context explicit
- "Format as JSON with fields: name (string), age (integer), skills (array of strings)"

### Neglecting Edge Cases

Problem: Not specifying handling for boundary conditions
- "Extract email addresses from the text" (what if there are none? multiple formats? invalid ones?)

Solution: Explicitly address likely edge cases
- "Extract email addresses. If none found, return empty array. Validate format and exclude malformed addresses."

### Cognitive Biases in Prompting

Problem: Unintentionally biased instructions
- "Quickly assess..." (implies less rigor)
- "Obviously..." (assumes conclusions)

Solution: Use neutral language
- "Assess this thoroughly and systematically"

## Task-Category Specific Guidance

### Creative Writing Tasks

Optimize for:
- Clear genre, tone, and style specifications
- Concrete examples of desired voice
- Explicit constraints (length, themes, audience)
- Freedom within well-defined boundaries

Avoid: Over-constraining the creative process

### Analytical Tasks

Optimize for:
- Self-consistency checks
- Multiple perspective consideration
- Explicit uncertainty acknowledgment
- Clear success criteria for analysis quality

Avoid: Allowing confirmation bias through leading questions

### Code Generation Tasks

Optimize for:
- Specific language and version
- Clear requirements and constraints
- Expected input/output specifications
- Error handling expectations
- Style guide references

Avoid: Vague requirements that lead to non-functional code

### Content Transformation Tasks

Optimize for:
- Clear source and target formats
- Explicit transformation rules
- Edge case handling
- Quality verification criteria

Avoid: Assuming obvious transformation patterns

### Question Answering Tasks

Optimize for:
- Specificity about desired answer depth
- Citation or evidence requirements
- Handling of uncertain or unknown information
- Format for qualified or partial answers

Avoid: Binary framing that prevents nuanced responses

## Model-Specific Considerations

While these principles apply broadly, adapt for specific models when possible:

### Claude-Specific Optimization
- Leverages strong instruction following
- Responds well to XML-style tags for structure
- Excels at nuanced tasks with detailed context
- Benefits from explicit thinking step requests

### ChatGPT-Specific Optimization
- Strong with conversational framing
- Responds well to role-based prompts ("You are an expert...")
- Benefits from clear examples
- Effective with system message guidance

### General Model Adaptation
- Test empirically rather than assuming
- Iterate based on actual performance
- Note model-specific strengths and optimize accordingly
- Be prepared to adjust techniques based on results

## Practical Workflow

When creating or refining a prompt:

1. **Understand the Task**: What are you actually trying to accomplish? What would success look like?

2. **Draft Initial Prompt**: Get something down quickly without over-optimizing

3. **Test and Observe**: Try the prompt and note what works and what doesn't

4. **Apply Analysis Framework**: Use the evaluation dimensions to identify issues

5. **Refine Systematically**: Address issues using the refinement methodology

6. **Add Appropriate Techniques**: Incorporate evidence-based patterns that fit the task

7. **Optimize Structure**: Apply structural principles for clarity and attention

8. **Test Edge Cases**: Try variations and boundary conditions

9. **Iterate**: Refine based on actual performance

10. **Document**: Record what worked for future reference

## Teaching Others

When helping others improve their prompts:

**Explain Your Reasoning**: Connect changes to underlying principles so they can generalize

**Highlight Patterns**: Point out recurring patterns across different prompts

**Encourage Experimentation**: Guide toward empirical testing rather than pure theory

**Build Mental Models**: Help them understand how language models process prompts

**Promote Best Practices**: Encourage documentation, version control, systematic approaches

The goal is building sustainable prompt engineering capabilities, not just fixing individual prompts.

## Conclusion

Effective prompt engineering combines art and science. These principles provide scientific foundation—research-backed techniques and structural optimization—but applying them requires judgment, creativity, and adaptation to specific contexts.

Master these fundamentals, then develop your own expertise through practice and systematic reflection on results. The most effective prompt engineers combine principled approaches with creative experimentation and continuous learning from actual outcomes.
