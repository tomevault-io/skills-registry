# SOP: Code Review Workflow

Comprehensive code review using specialized reviewers for different quality aspects.

## Timeline: 4 Hours

**Phases**:
1. Automated Checks (30 min)
2. Specialized Reviews (2 hours)
3. Integration Review (1 hour)
4. Final Approval (30 min)

---

## Phase 1: Automated Checks (30 minutes)

### Quick Quality Checks

**Parallel Automated Testing**:

```javascript
// Initialize review swarm
await mcp__ruv-swarm__swarm_init({
  topology: 'star',  // Coordinator pattern for reviews
  maxAgents: 6,
  strategy: 'specialized'
});

// Run all automated checks in parallel
const [lint, tests, coverage, build] = await Promise.all([
  Task("Linter", `
Run linting checks:
- ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Pylint for Python
- RuboCop for Ruby
- Check for code style violations

Store results: code-review/${prId}/lint-results
`, "reviewer"),

  Task("Test Runner", `
Run test suite:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests (if applicable)
- All tests must pass

Store results: code-review/${prId}/test-results
`, "tester"),

  Task("Coverage Analyzer", `
Check code coverage:
- Overall coverage > 80%
- New code coverage > 90%
- No critical paths uncovered

Generate coverage report
Store: code-review/${prId}/coverage-report
`, "reviewer"),

  Task("Build Validator", `
Validate build:
- Clean build (no warnings)
- Type checking passes
- No broken dependencies
- Bundle size within limits

Store build results: code-review/${prId}/build-status
`, "reviewer")
]);

// If any automated check fails, stop and request fixes
if (hasFailures([lint, tests, coverage, build])) {
  await Task("Review Coordinator", `
Automated checks failed. Request fixes from author:
${summarizeFailures([lint, tests, coverage, build])}

Store feedback: code-review/${prId}/automated-feedback
`, "pr-manager");
  return; // Stop review until fixed
}
```

**Deliverables**:
- All automated checks passing
- Test results documented
- Coverage report generated

## Phase 2: Specialized Reviews (2 hours)

### Parallel Expert Reviews

**Sequential coordination of parallel reviews**:

```javascript
// Spawn specialized reviewers in parallel
const [codeQuality, security, performance, architecture, docs] = await Promise.all([
  Task("Code Quality Reviewer", `
Review for code quality:

**Readability**:

## Review Guidelines

### What Reviewers Should Focus On

**DO Review**:
- Logic correctness
- Edge case handling
- Error handling robustness
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance implications
- Code clarity and maintainability
- Test coverage and quality
- API design and contracts
- Documentation completeness

**DON'T Nitpick**:
- Personal style preferences (use automated linting)
- Minor variable naming (unless truly confusing)
- Trivial formatting (use automated formatting)
- Subjective "better" ways (unless significantly better)

### Giving Feedback

**Effective Feedback**:
- ✅ "This function has O(n²) complexity. Consider using a hash map for O(n)."
- ✅ "This input isn't validated. Add validation to prevent SQL injection."
- ✅ "This error isn't logged. Add error logging for debugging."

**Ineffective Feedback**:
- ❌ "I don't like this."
- ❌ "This could be better."
- ❌ "Change this." (without explanation)

**Tone**:
- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent
- Ask questions rather than make demands
- Suggest, don't dictate (unless security/critical issue)
