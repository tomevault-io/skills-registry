# GitHub Project Management Skill

## Overview

Automate and orchestrate GitHub project management workflows using intelligent agent coordination. This skill provides comprehensive project management capabilities including automated issue triage, sprint planning, milestone tracking, project board synchronization, and team coordination through GitHub Projects v2 integration.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when planning and executing development sprints, managing issue backlogs and triage queues, coordinating work across distributed teams, automating project board updates and status tracking, tracking milestones and release schedules, or establishing project management workflows for new teams.

Use for both small team projects (2-5 developers) and large-scale coordination (10+ team members), agile/scrum sprint management, kanban-style continuous delivery, or hybrid project management approaches.

## Agent Coordination Architecture

### Swarm Topology

Initialize a **star topology** with a central coordinator agent managing specialized agents for issue tracking, planning, and board synchronization. Star topology enables centralized control with efficient communication to specialized agents.

```bash
# Initialize star swarm for project management
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm init --topology star --max-agents 6 --strategy balanced
```

### Specialized Agent Roles

**Central Coordinator** (`coordinator`): Hub agent that orchestrates all project management activities. Makes prioritization decisions, coordinates between teams, and ensures consistency across project artifacts. Acts as project manager.

**Planner** (`planner`): Handles sprint planning, capacity estimation, and resource allocation. Creates sprint goals, breaks down epics into stories, estimates effort, and balances workload across team members.

**Issue Tracker** (`issue-tracker`): Automates issue triage, labeling, assignment, and lifecycle management. Monitors new issues, applies initial classification, routes to appropriate team members, and tracks resolution progress.

**Project Board Sync** (`project-board-sync`): Maintains GitHub Projects v2 boards, updates issue status, manages custom fields, and enforces workflow automation. Ensures boards accurately reflect current project state.

## Project Management Workflows (SOP)

### Workflow 1: Automated Issue Triage

Process incoming issues with intelligent classification and routing.

**Phase 1: Issue Ingestion**

**Step 1.1: Initialize Star Topology**

```bash
# Set up star swarm with coordinator hub
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init topology=star maxAgents=6 strategy=balanced

# Spawn coordinator and specialists
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=coordinator name=coordinator
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=researcher name=issue-tracker
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=researcher name=planner
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=coordinator name=project-board-sync
```

**Step 1.2: Monitor New Issues**

Set up real-time monitoring for new issues:

```bash
# Subscribe to new issues
bash scripts/github-webhook.sh subscribe \
  --repo <owner/repo> \
  --events "issues" \
  --callback "scripts/process-new-issue.sh"
```

Or use MCP real-time subscription if Flow-Nexus available:

```bash
mcp__flow-nexus__realtime_subscribe table=issues event=INSERT
```

**Step 1.3: Fetch Issue Details**

When new issue created, fetch comprehensive context:

```bash
# Get issue details with comments and reactions
bash scripts/github-api.sh fetch-issue \
  --repo <owner/repo> \
  --issue <number> \
  --include-comments true
```

**Phase 2: Intelligent Classification**

**Step 2.1: Analyze Issue Content**

```plaintext
Task("Issue Tracker", "
  Analyze and classify new issue #<NUMBER>:

  1. Read issue body and comments from memory: github/issues/<NUMBER>
  2. Classify issue type: bug|feature|enhancement|documentation|question
  3. Determine severity: critical|high|medium|low
  4. Identify affected components using references/component-map.md
  5. Estimate complexity: simple|moderate|complex
  6. Check for duplicates using similarity search
  7. Extract key entities: affected files, error messages, user impact

  Use scripts/issue-classifier.sh for ML-based classification
  Store classification in memory: github/triage/<NUMBER>
  Run hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description 'issue triage'
", "issue-tracker")
```

**Step 2.2: Apply Labels and Metadata**

```bash
# Set up custom field automation
bash scripts/project-api.sh configure-fields \
  --project <project-id> \
  --config "references/custom-fields.json"
```

Custom field examples:
- **Complexity**: Auto-calculate from file changes
- **Priority Score**: Weighted algorithm based on impact/urgency
- **Cycle Time**: Auto-track time from start to completion
- **Review Status**: Sync with PR approval status
- **Team**: Auto-assign based on component ownership

### Integration with External Tools

Connect project management with external systems:

```bash
# Sync with Jira
bash scripts/external-sync.sh jira \
  --project <jira-project> \
  --github-repo <owner/repo> \
  --sync-direction "bidirectional"

# Push to Slack
bash scripts/notifications.sh slack \
  --webhook <slack-webhook> \
  --events "issue-created,pr-merged,milestone-completed"
```

### Analytics and Insights

Generate comprehensive project analytics:

```bash
# Run analytics suite
bash scripts/project-analytics.sh analyze \
  --repo <owner/repo> \
  --period "last-quarter" \
  --metrics "velocity,lead-time,cycle-time,throughput" \
  --visualize true \
  --output "references/analytics-report.html"
```

## MCP Tool Integration

### Task Orchestration

```bash
# Orchestrate complex project management workflow
mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate \
  task="Plan and initialize Sprint 42" \
  strategy=sequential \
  maxAgents=4 \
  priority=high
```

### Swarm Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor project management agent activity
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_status verbose=true

# Get agent performance metrics
mcp__claude-flow__agent_metrics metric=tasks
```

## Best Practices

**Consistent Labeling**: Use standardized label taxonomy across all repositories. Document label meanings in `references/label-taxonomy.md`.

**Automated Triage**: Run triage automation within 1 hour of issue creation to ensure responsive project management.

**Capacity Planning**: Always validate sprint capacity before committing work. Include buffer for unplanned work and meetings.

**Board Hygiene**: Run daily board sync to keep project boards accurate. Stale boards reduce team trust in project management.

**Retrospective Action**: Convert retrospective insights into concrete process improvements. Track improvement initiatives as issues.

**Clear Ownership**: Every issue should have exactly one assignee. Shared ownership leads to unclear accountability.

**Regular Communication**: Generate automated status reports for stakeholders. Transparency builds trust and reduces status meetings.

## Error Handling

**API Rate Limiting**: Implement caching and batching for GitHub API calls. Use GraphQL for complex queries to reduce request count.

**Conflict Resolution**: If issue assigned to multiple milestones, coordinator resolves based on priority and capacity constraints.

**Missing Data**: If issue lacks required classification data, flag for human review rather than making incorrect assumptions.

**Board Sync Failures**: Maintain local state cache to recover from transient API failures. Retry with exponential backoff.
