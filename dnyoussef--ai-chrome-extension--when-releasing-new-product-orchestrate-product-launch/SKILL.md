# Product Launch Orchestration Workflow

Complete end-to-end product launch workflow orchestrating 15+ specialist agents across research, development, marketing, launch execution, and post-launch monitoring. Designed for comprehensive product launches requiring coordination across technical, marketing, sales, and operations teams.

## Overview

This SOP orchestrates a complete 10-week product launch using multi-agent coordination with hierarchical topology.

## Memory Coordination

### Namespace Convention

All workflow data follows this hierarchical pattern:

```
product-launch/{launch-id}/phase-{N}/{agent-type}/{deliverable-type}
```

**Examples**:
- `product-launch/saas-app-v1/phase-1/market-researcher/analysis`
- `product-launch/saas-app-v1/phase-2/backend-developer/api-spec`
- `product-launch/saas-app-v1/phase-3/marketing-specialist/campaign`
- `product-launch/saas-app-v1/phase-4/devops-engineer/deployment-log`
- `product-launch/saas-app-v1/phase-5/weekly-report/week-1`

### Cross-Phase Data Flow

**Phase 1 → Phase 2**:
```bash
# Phase 2 agents retrieve Phase 1 strategy
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --key "product-launch/${LAUNCH_ID}/phase-1/product-manager/plan"
```

**Phase 2 → Phase 3**:
```bash
# Marketing agents retrieve product specs
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --key "product-launch/${LAUNCH_ID}/phase-2/backend-developer/api-spec"
```

**Phase 3 → Phase 4**:
```bash
# Deployment retrieves marketing timeline
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --key "product-launch/${LAUNCH_ID}/phase-3/marketing-specialist/campaign"
```

**Phase 4 → Phase 5**:
```bash
# Monitoring retrieves launch metrics baseline
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --pattern "product-launch/${LAUNCH_ID}/phase-4/*/metrics"
```

## GraphViz Process Diagram

See `when-releasing-new-product-orchestrate-product-launch-process.dot` for visual workflow representation showing:
- 5 phases with sequential and parallel execution patterns
- 15+ agent interactions and data flows
- Memory coordination points between phases
- Decision gates and validation checkpoints
- Optimization loops in Phase 5

## Quality Checklist

Before considering launch complete, verify:

- [ ] **Phase 1**: Market validated, strategy approved, business case solid
- [ ] **Phase 2**: All applications deployed, tests passing, security audited
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Marketing campaigns ready, sales team trained, support operational
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Production stable, first customers acquired, monitoring active
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Metrics tracking positively, optimization loops running

**All phase deliverables stored in memory following namespace convention**:
- [ ] `product-launch/${LAUNCH_ID}/phase-1/*` - Research and strategy
- [ ] `product-launch/${LAUNCH_ID}/phase-2/*` - Development artifacts
- [ ] `product-launch/${LAUNCH_ID}/phase-3/*` - Marketing materials
- [ ] `product-launch/${LAUNCH_ID}/phase-4/*` - Launch metrics
- [ ] `product-launch/${LAUNCH_ID}/phase-5/*` - Weekly reports

**Workflow Complexity**: High (15+ agents, 10 weeks, 5 phases)
**Coordination Pattern**: Hierarchical with adaptive parallel execution
**Memory Footprint**: ~50-100 memory entries per launch
**Typical Use Case**: Major product launches requiring comprehensive coordination
