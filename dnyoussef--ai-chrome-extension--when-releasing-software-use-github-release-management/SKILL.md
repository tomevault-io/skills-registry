# GitHub Release Management Skill

## Overview

Orchestrate end-to-end software release processes with intelligent agent coordination. This skill automates version bumping, changelog generation, release candidate testing, deployment orchestration, post-release validation, and rollback procedures for GitHub-hosted projects using comprehensive CI/CD integration.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when creating production releases with automated validation, coordinating multi-environment deployments (staging, production), generating release notes and changelogs automatically, managing semantic versioning across projects, implementing deployment strategies (rolling, blue-green, canary), handling hotfix releases and emergency patches, or establishing release automation for new projects.

Use for both small single-repository releases and complex multi-service deployments, scheduled regular releases or on-demand deployments, and establishing release governance and compliance.

## Agent Coordination Architecture

### Swarm Topology

Initialize a **hierarchical topology** with release-manager as coordinator overseeing specialized deployment, testing, and documentation agents. Hierarchical structure ensures coordinated decision-making for critical release operations.

```bash
# Initialize hierarchical swarm for release management
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm init --topology hierarchical --max-agents 8 --strategy specialized
```

### Specialized Agent Roles

**Release Manager** (`release-manager`): Top-level coordinator that oversees entire release process. Makes go/no-go decisions, coordinates deployment timing, manages rollback decisions, and ensures release quality standards. Acts as release captain.

**CI/CD Engineer** (`cicd-engineer`): Manages build pipelines, deployment automation, infrastructure provisioning, and deployment strategy execution. Handles technical deployment mechanics and environment configuration.

**Test Engineer** (`tester`): Validates release candidates through automated testing, regression testing, performance testing, and smoke testing. Verifies deployment success and monitors post-deployment health.

**Code Reviewer** (`reviewer`): Performs final code review of release branch, validates security compliance, checks for last-minute issues, and approves release artifacts.

**Documentation Writer** (`docs-writer`): Generates release notes, updates changelogs, creates deployment runbooks, and documents breaking changes. Ensures comprehensive release documentation.

## Release Management Workflows (SOP)

### Workflow 1: Standard Release (Major/Minor/Patch)

Execute full release cycle from version bump to production deployment.

**Phase 1: Pre-Release Preparation**

**Step 1.1: Initialize Release Swarm**

```bash
# Set up hierarchical release swarm
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init topology=hierarchical maxAgents=8 strategy=specialized

# Spawn release team
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=coordinator name=release-manager
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=coder name=cicd-engineer
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=researcher name=tester
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=analyst name=reviewer
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=researcher name=docs-writer
```

**Step 1.2: Determine Release Version**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Determine next release version:

  1. Fetch current version from package.json / Cargo.toml / VERSION file
  2. Analyze commits since last release using git log
  3. Classify changes: breaking|features|fixes|docs
  4. Apply semantic versioning rules:
     - Breaking changes → major version bump
     - New features → minor version bump
     - Bug fixes only → patch version bump
  5. Check for forced version override in environment

  Use scripts/semver.sh for version calculation
  Store version decision in memory: release/version
  Run hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description 'version determination'
", "release-manager")
```

```bash
# Calculate next version
NEXT_VERSION=$(bash scripts/semver.sh calculate \
  --current $(cat VERSION) \
  --commits-since-tag "v$(cat VERSION)" \
  --bump-strategy "auto")
```

bash scripts/github-api.sh create-release \
  --repo <owner/repo> \
  --tag "v${NEXT_VERSION}" \
  --name "Version ${NEXT_VERSION}" \
  --body-file "references/release-notes-v${NEXT_VERSION}.md" \
  --draft true \
  --prerelease false
```

**Step 4.2: Go/No-Go Decision**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Make final go/no-go decision:

  1. Review all agent findings from memory
  2. Check validation test results: release/validation
  3. Verify security review passed: release/security-review
  4. Confirm stakeholder approval received
  5. Validate deployment window available
  6. Make final decision: proceed or abort

  Store decision in memory: release/go-no-go
", "release-manager")
```

  --version "${NEXT_VERSION}" \
  --strategy "canary" \
  --canary-percentage "10,25,50,100" \
  --canary-delay-seconds 600
```

**Phase 5: Post-Release Validation**

**Step 5.1: Production Smoke Tests**

```plaintext
Task("Test Engineer", "
  Validate production deployment:

  1. Run production smoke test suite
  2. Validate critical user journeys
  3. Check error rates and latency metrics
  4. Verify monitoring dashboards showing healthy state
  5. Test rollback procedure (in separate environment)

  Use scripts/production-validation.sh
  Store validation results in memory: release/prod-validation
", "tester")
```

**Step 5.2: Publish GitHub Release**

Once production validated, publish the draft release:

```bash
# Publish GitHub release
bash scripts/github-api.sh publish-release \
  --repo <owner/repo> \
  --tag "v${NEXT_VERSION}"
```

**Step 5.3: Post-Release Monitoring**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Monitor post-release health:

  1. Track error rates for 24 hours post-release
  2. Monitor user reports and support tickets
  3. Watch for performance degradation
  4. Check for unexpected edge cases
  5. Prepare hotfix if critical issues discovered

  Use scripts/release-monitoring.sh
  Store monitoring data in memory: release/monitoring
", "release-manager")
```

**Step 5.4: Merge Release Branch**

```bash
# Merge release branch back to main

git merge --no-ff "release/v${NEXT_VERSION}"
git tag "v${NEXT_VERSION}"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge to develop if using gitflow
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff "release/v${NEXT_VERSION}"
git push origin develop
```

### Workflow 2: Hotfix Release

Execute emergency patch release for critical production issues.

**Phase 1: Hotfix Initiation**

**Step 1.1: Create Hotfix Branch**

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from production tag
git checkout -b "hotfix/v${CURRENT_VERSION}-hotfix.1" "v${CURRENT_VERSION}"
git push origin "hotfix/v${CURRENT_VERSION}-hotfix.1"
```

**Step 1.2: Apply Fix and Test**

```plaintext
Task("CI/CD Engineer", "
  Apply hotfix and validate:

  1. Cherry-pick fix commits to hotfix branch
  2. Bump version with hotfix suffix
  3. Run targeted regression tests
  4. Build hotfix artifacts
  5. Deploy to staging for validation
  6. Document fix in hotfix-specific changelog

  Use scripts/hotfix.sh for automation
  Store hotfix status in memory: release/hotfix
", "cicd-engineer")
```

**Phase 2: Expedited Deployment**

**Step 2.1: Fast-Track Approval**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Expedite hotfix approval:

  1. Assess severity and urgency
  2. Fast-track security review (critical paths only)
  3. Skip non-critical validation steps
  4. Get stakeholder approval via emergency process
  5. Approve for immediate production deployment

  Store approval in memory: release/hotfix-approval
", "release-manager")
```

**Step 2.2: Deploy Hotfix**

```bash
# Deploy hotfix to production immediately
bash scripts/deploy.sh \
  --environment "production" \
  --version "${HOTFIX_VERSION}" \
  --strategy "rolling" \
  --fast-rollout true
```

**Step 2.3: Backport Hotfix**

```bash
# Merge hotfix to main and develop branches
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff "hotfix/${HOTFIX_VERSION}"
git push origin main

git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff "hotfix/${HOTFIX_VERSION}"
git push origin develop
```

### Workflow 3: Rollback Management

Handle failed deployments with automated rollback.

**Phase 1: Failure Detection**

**Step 1.1: Monitor Deployment Health**

```bash
# Continuous health monitoring
bash scripts/health-monitor.sh \
  --environment "production" \
  --error-rate-threshold 5.0 \
  --latency-threshold-p99 2000 \
  --alert-on-threshold true
```

**Step 1.2: Identify Failure Criteria**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Assess deployment health and determine if rollback needed:

  1. Check error rate spike (>5% increase)
  2. Monitor latency degradation (>50% increase)
  3. Track failed health checks
  4. Review user impact reports
  5. Make rollback decision based on severity

  Use references/rollback-criteria.md
  Store decision in memory: release/rollback-decision
", "release-manager")
```

**Phase 2: Rollback Execution**

**Step 2.1: Trigger Automated Rollback**

```bash
# Execute rollback to previous version
bash scripts/rollback.sh \
  --environment "production" \
  --target-version "${PREVIOUS_VERSION}" \
  --strategy "immediate" \
  --preserve-data true
```

**Step 2.2: Validate Rollback Success**

```plaintext
Task("Test Engineer", "
  Validate rollback restored service:

  1. Confirm previous version deployed
  2. Run smoke tests
  3. Verify error rates normalized
  4. Check data integrity maintained
  5. Monitor for 1 hour post-rollback

  Store rollback validation in memory: release/rollback-validation
", "tester")
```

**Step 2.3: Post-Mortem Analysis**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Conduct rollback post-mortem:

  1. Document failure root cause
  2. Identify what testing missed the issue
  3. Create action items to prevent recurrence
  4. Update release process with learnings
  5. Schedule fix and re-release

  Use references/postmortem-template.md
  Store post-mortem in memory: release/postmortem
", "release-manager")
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Rolling Deployment

Gradually replace instances with new version. Default strategy for most releases.

**Characteristics:**
- Low risk: issues affect subset of users
- Gradual rollout: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%
- Easy rollback: stop deployment and roll back affected instances
- No extra infrastructure required

### Blue-Green Deployment

Maintain two identical environments, switch traffic atomically.

**Characteristics:**
- Zero downtime: instant traffic switch
- Easy rollback: switch traffic back
- Requires 2x infrastructure temporarily
- Good for database migration testing

### Canary Deployment

Route small percentage of traffic to new version, gradually increase.

**Characteristics:**
- Minimal blast radius: 1-5% initial exposure
- A/B testing capability: compare metrics
- Gradual confidence building
- Requires traffic routing capabilities

## MCP Tool Integration

### Task Orchestration

```bash
# Orchestrate full release workflow
mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate \
  task="Execute release v2.0.0" \
  strategy=sequential \
  maxAgents=5 \
  priority=critical
```

### Swarm Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor release agent progress
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_status verbose=true

# Get deployment metrics
mcp__claude-flow__agent_metrics metric=performance
```

## Best Practices

**Semantic Versioning**: Always follow semver strictly. Breaking changes require major version bump, features require minor, fixes require patch.

**Release Automation**: Automate all repeatable tasks. Human intervention should only be required for go/no-go decisions.

**Comprehensive Testing**: Never skip testing phases. Staging validation catches 80% of production issues.

**Incremental Rollout**: Use canary or rolling deployments for major releases. Minimize blast radius of issues.

**Rollback Readiness**: Always maintain ability to rollback. Test rollback procedure before production deployment.

**Documentation First**: Generate release notes and changelog before deployment. Documentation helps with debugging post-release issues.

**Monitoring and Alerts**: Ensure comprehensive monitoring before release. Post-release issues should trigger automatic alerts.

**Communication**: Notify stakeholders at each phase: release start, deployment begin, deployment complete, validation passed.

## Error Handling

**Build Failures**: If CI build fails, automatically abort release and notify release manager. Do not proceed with broken builds.

**Test Failures**: Any validation test failure blocks release. Investigate root cause before retry.

**Deployment Failures**: Trigger automatic rollback if deployment health checks fail. Preserve application state and data.

**Monitoring Gaps**: If monitoring unavailable, delay deployment until monitoring restored. Flying blind is unacceptable.

**Version Conflicts**: If version already exists, coordinator decides: force bump or abort. Never overwrite existing releases.
