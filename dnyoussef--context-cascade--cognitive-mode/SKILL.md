# Cognitive Mode Management

A comprehensive skill for managing cognitive modes, VERILINGUA frames, VERIX epistemic notation, and GlobalMOO optimization in the Context Cascade plugin system.

## Overview

This skill integrates four major systems:

1. **VERILINGUA**: 7 cognitive frames from diverse linguistic traditions
2. **VERIX**: Epistemic notation for claim validation
3. **DSPy**: Two-layer prompt optimization (Level 2 caching + Level 1 evolution)
4. **GlobalMOO**: Multi-objective optimization for configuration tuning

## Slash Commands

### /mode - Mode Selection

Select and configure cognitive modes:

```bash
/mode                    # List available modes
/mode <name>             # Select mode by name
/mode auto "<task>"      # Auto-select based on task
/mode info <name>        # Show mode details
/mode recommend "<task>" # Get top-3 recommendations
```

**Available Modes**:
- `strict`: Maximum epistemic consistency (research, legal, medical)
- `balanced`: Good tradeoff for general use (default)
- `efficient`: Optimized for token efficiency (high-volume APIs)
- `robust`: Edge case handling (security, adversarial)
- `minimal`: Lightweight with no frames (simple Q&A)

### /eval - Evaluation

Evaluate tasks against cognitive architecture metrics:

```bash
/eval "<task>" "<response>"  # Evaluate response
/eval --corpus <path>        # Run corpus evaluation
/eval --metrics              # Show metric definitions
/eval --graders              # List available graders
```

**Metrics**:
- `task_accuracy`: Correctness (0.0 - 1.0)
- `token_efficiency`: Tokens vs target (0.0 - 1.0)
- `edge_robustness`: Adversarial handling (0.0 - 1.0)
- `epistemic_consistency`: VERIX compliance (0.0 - 1.0)

### /optimize - GlobalMOO Optimization

Run multi-objective optimization:

```bash
/optimize               # Show optimization status
/optimize start         # Start optimization run
/optimize suggest       # Get configuration suggestions
/optimize report        # Get optimization report
/optimize phase <A|B|C> # Run specific cascade phase
```

**Three-MOO Cascade**:
- Phase A: Framework structure optimization
- Phase B: Edge case discovery
- Phase C: Production frontier refinement

### /pareto - Pareto Frontier

Explore the Pareto frontier:

```bash
/pareto                  # Display frontier
/pareto filter <metric>  # Filter by metric
/pareto export           # Export as JSON
/pareto distill          # Distill into named modes
/pareto visualize        # ASCII visualization
```

### /frame - VERILINGUA Frames

Configure cognitive frames:

```bash
/frame                    # List all frames
/frame <name>             # Show frame details
/frame enable <names>     # Enable frames
/frame disable <names>    # Disable frames
/frame preset <name>      # Apply preset
```

**Frames**:
- `evidential`: Turkish -mis/-di ("How do you know?")
- `aspectual`: Russian pfv/ipfv ("Complete or ongoing?")
- `morphological`: Arabic trilateral roots (semantic decomposition)
- `compositional`: German compounding (primitives to compounds)
- `honorific`: Japanese keigo (audience calibration)
- `classifier`: Chinese measure words (object comparison)
- `spatial`: Guugu Yimithirr (absolute positioning)

**Presets**:
- `all`: All 7 frames
- `minimal`: No frames
- `research`: evidential + aspectual
- `coding`: compositional + spatial
- `documentation`: honorific + compositional
- `analysis`: evidential + aspectual + morphological
- `security`: evidential + spatial + classifier

### /verix - Epistemic Notation

Apply VERIX notation:

```bash
/verix                     # Show VERIX guide
/verix parse "<text>"      # Parse for VERIX elements
/verix validate "<claim>"  # Validate epistemic consistency
/verix annotate "<text>"   # Add VERIX annotations
/verix level <0|1|2>       # Set compression level
```

**VERIX Structure**:
```
STATEMENT := ILLOCUTION + AFFECT + CONTENT + GROUND + CONFIDENCE + STATE
```

**Compression Levels**:
- L0: AI-AI (Emoji shorthand, maximum compression)
- L1: AI+Human (Full annotation, balanced)
- L2: Human (Natural language, lossy)

## Thin Waist Architecture

Two contracts that NEVER change:

**Contract 1 - PromptBuilder**:
```python
def build(task: str, task_type: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """Returns (system_prompt, user_prompt)"""
```

**Contract 2 - Evaluate**:
```python
def evaluate(config_vector: List[float]) -> OutcomesVector:
    """config_vector -> outcomes_vector"""
```

## Configuration Vector

14-dimensional vector for GlobalMOO:
- Dimensions 0-6: Framework flags (7 cognitive frames)
- Dimension 7: VERIX strictness (0-2)
- Dimension 8: Compression level (0-2)
- Dimensions 9-13: Reserved for future use

## Integration with Meta-Loop

This skill integrates with the recursive improvement system:

1. **Prompt Forge**: Optimizes prompts (including skill prompts)
2. **Skill Forge**: Applies improvements (including to itself)
3. **Agent Creator**: Creates auditor agents
4. **Eval Harness**: Gates ALL changes (FROZEN - never self-improves)

## 3-Model Council

For cross-model compatibility, evaluation uses a 3-model council:
- Claude (primary)
- Gemini (validation)
- Codex (technical verification)

All three must agree for high-confidence claims.

## Core Principles

### 1. Mode-First Thinking
Always select the appropriate cognitive mode before executing tasks. Modes encode domain-specific optimizations that dramatically improve outcomes. Don't default to balanced - consciously choose based on task requirements.

### 2. Epistemic Hygiene
Every high-confidence claim requires grounding. Use VERIX notation to make epistemic status explicit. Ungrounded certainty is a red flag - always provide evidence basis for strong assertions.

### 3. Multi-Objective Optimization
Recognize that accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and consistency often trade off against each other. Use GlobalMOO to find Pareto-optimal configurations rather than optimizing a single metric.

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Correct Approach |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Using minimal mode for security tasks** | Minimal mode lacks evidential and spatial frames critical for security analysis. Missing grounding leads to unverified claims about vulnerabilities. | Use robust or strict mode for security tasks. Enable evidential + spatial + classifier frames. |
| **High confidence without grounding** | VERIX validation will flag ungrounded certainty. Reduces epistemic_consistency score. Undermines trust in system outputs. | Always provide ground for conf > 80%. Use [ground: direct observation] or [ground: expert testimony]. |
| **Optimizing holdout corpus** | Holdout corpus marked never_optimize: true. Optimizing it causes Goodhart's Law - optimizing for benchmark rather than true capability. | Separate training (core_corpus) from validation (holdout). NEVER modify holdout tasks. |

---

## Conclusion

The cognitive-mode skill provides a unified interface to VERILINGUA, VERIX, DSPy, and GlobalMOO. By selecting appropriate modes, applying epistemic notation, and running multi-objective optimization, you can dramatically improve AI task performance across diverse domains.

Key insight: The cognitive architecture is itself subject to recursive improvement. The prompt-architect, skill-forge, and agent-creator form a foundry triangle that continuously optimizes the system - but always gated by the frozen eval harness to prevent Goodhart's Law.
