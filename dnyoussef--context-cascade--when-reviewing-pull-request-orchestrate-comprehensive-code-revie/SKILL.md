# Code Review Orchestration Workflow

Comprehensive code review workflow orchestrating 12-15 specialized reviewers across automated checks, parallel expert reviews, integration analysis, and final approval recommendation. Designed for thorough quality validation across security, performance, architecture, testing, and documentation dimensions in a systematic 4-hour process.



---

## LIBRARY-FIRST PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**Before writing ANY code, you MUST check:**

### Step 1: Library Catalog
- Location: `.claude/library/catalog.json`
- If match >70%: REUSE or ADAPT

### Step 2: Patterns Guide
- Location: `.claude/docs/inventories/LIBRARY-PATTERNS-GUIDE.md`
- If pattern exists: FOLLOW documented approach

### Step 3: Existing Projects
- Location: `D:\Projects\*`
- If found: EXTRACT and adapt

### Decision Matrix
| Match | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Library >90% | REUSE directly |
| Library 70-90% | ADAPT minimally |
| Pattern exists | FOLLOW pattern |
| In project | EXTRACT |
| No match | BUILD (add to library after) |

## Overview

This SOP implements a multi-dimensional code review process using star topology coordination where a central PR manager orchestrates specialized reviewers operating in parallel. The workflow emphasizes both thoroughness and efficiency by running automated checks first (gate 1), then parallelizing specialized human-centric reviews, followed by integration impact analysis, and finally synthesizing all findings into actionable recommendations.

The star pattern enables each specialist to focus deeply on their domain while the coordinator ensures comprehensive coverage and prevents conflicting feedback. Memory coordination allows reviewers to reference findings from other specialists, creating a holistic review experience.

## Trigger Conditions

Use this workflow when:
- Reviewing pull requests requiring comprehensive quality validation
- Changes span multiple quality dimensions (code, security, performance, architecture)
- Need systematic review from multiple specialist perspectives
- PR introduces significant functionality or architectural changes
- Merge decision requires evidence-based go/no-go recommendation
- Team wants consistent, repeatable review process
- Code review SLA is within 4 hours (business hours)

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Automated Checks (30 Minutes, Parallel Gate)

**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Execution Mode**: Parallel automated validation (fast fail-fast gate)
**Agents**: `code-analyzer`, `tester`, `qa-engineer`, `pr-manager`

**Process**:

1. **Initialize Review Swarm**
   ```bash
   PR_ID="$1"  # e.g., "repo-name/pulls/123"
   PR_NUMBER=$(echo $PR_ID | cut -d'/' -f3)

   npx claude-flow hooks pre-task --description "Code review: PR #${PR_NUMBER}"
   npx claude-flow swarm init --topology star --max-agents 15 --strategy specialized
   npx claude-flow agent spawn --type pr-manager
   ```

   **PR Manager** retrieves PR metadata:
   - Changed files and line counts
   - Commit history and messages
   - Branch comparison (base vs head)
   - PR description and labels
   - Author and reviewers assigned

   **Memory Storage**:
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow memory store --key "code-review/${PR_ID}/metadata" \
     --value '{"pr_number": "'"${PR_NUMBER}"'", "files_changed": 15, "lines_added": 342, "lines_deleted": 78}'
   ```

2. **Run Automated Checks in Parallel**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow task orchestrate --strategy parallel --max-agents 4
   ```

   Spawn all automated check agents concurrently:

   **Linting Check** (Code Analyzer):
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow agent spawn --type code-analyzer --focus "linting"

   # Run linting
   npm run lint  # ESLint for JS/TS
   # or
   pylint src/  # Python
   # or
   rubocop  # Ruby
   ```

   Checks:
   - Code style violations (max line length, indentation)
   - Unused variables and imports
   - Type errors (TypeScript)
   - Deprecated API usage
   - Code complexity warnings

   **Memory Pattern**: `code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-1/code-analyzer/lint-results`

   **Test Execution** (Tester):
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow agent spawn --type tester --focus "test-execution"

   # Run test suite
   npm test  # Jest/Mocha
   # or
   pytest  # Python
   # or
   rspec  # Ruby
   ```

   Validates:
   - All unit tests passing
   - All integration tests passing
   - All E2E tests passing (if applicable)
   - No flaky test failures
   - Test execution time within limits

   **Memory Pattern**: `code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-1/tester/test-results`

   **Coverage Analysis** (QA Engineer):
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow agent spawn --type tester --focus "coverage"

   # Generate coverage report
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

   Checks:
   - Overall coverage > 80%
   - New code coverage > 90%
   - No critical paths uncovered
   - Coverage delta (did coverage decrease?)
   - Untested branches and conditions

   **Memory Pattern**: `code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-1/qa-engineer/coverage-report`

   **Build Validation** (Code Analyzer):
   ```bash
   # Clean build validation
   npm run build
   # or
   python setup.py build
   ```

   Validates:
   - Clean build (no errors, no warnings)
   - Type checking passes (TypeScript, mypy)
   - No broken dependencies
   - Bundle size within limits (for frontend)
   - No circular dependencies

   **Memory Pattern**: `code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-1/code-analyzer/build-status`

3. **Evaluate Gate 1 Results**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow memory retrieve --pattern "code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-1/*/results"
   ```

   **PR Manager** aggregates automated results:
   - Lint: PASS/FAIL (violations count)
   - Tests: PASS/FAIL (passed/failed/skipped)
   - Coverage: PASS/FAIL (percentage, delta)
   - Build: PASS/FAIL (errors/warnings)

   **Decision Logic**:
   ```javascript
   if (lintFailed || testsFailed || buildFailed) {
     // Request fixes from author
     await notifyAuthor({
       status: 'CHANGES_REQUESTED',
       message: 'Automated checks failed. Please fix before review continues.',
       details: summarizeFailures()
     });

     // Store feedback and stop review
     await memory_store(`code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-1/automated-feedback`);
     return; // Stop review until fixed
   }

   // All automated checks passed, proceed to Phase 2
   await notifyAuthor({
     status: 'IN_REVIEW',
     message: 'Automated checks passed. Proceeding with specialized reviews.'
   });
   ```

**Outputs**:
- Automated check results (pass/fail for each)
- Test execution report
- Coverage report with delta
- Build status

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All linting checks passing
- [ ] All tests passing (100% of test suite)
- [ ] Code coverage meets thresholds
- [ ] Build successful with no errors

### Phase 3: Integration Analysis (1 Hour, Sequential Impact Assessment)

**Duration**: 1 hour
**Execution Mode**: Sequential end-to-end impact analysis
**Agents**: `tester`, `devops-engineer`, `product-manager`, `code-reviewer`

**Process**:

1. **Integration Testing**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow agent spawn --type tester --focus "integration-impact"
   ```

   **QA Engineer** tests:
   - Does this change break existing functionality?
   - Are all integration tests passing?
   - Does it integrate properly with related modules?
   - Any unexpected side effects or regressions?

   Run integration test suite:
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration
   ```

   **Findings**:
   - Integration tests: 45/45 passing
   - No regressions detected
   - New functionality integrates cleanly

   **Memory Pattern**: `code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-3/tester/integration-tests`

2. **Deployment Impact Assessment**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow memory retrieve --key "code-review/${PR_ID}/metadata"
   npx claude-flow agent spawn --type cicd-engineer --focus "deployment-impact"
   ```

   **DevOps Engineer** evaluates:
   - Infrastructure changes needed? (new services, scaling)
   - Database migrations required? (schema changes)
   - Configuration updates needed? (env vars, secrets)
   - Backward compatibility maintained? (can rollback safely)
   - Rollback plan clear and tested?

   **Findings**:
   ```json
   {
     "infrastructure_changes": ["Add Redis cache for session storage"],
     "database_migrations": ["Add index on users.email for faster lookups"],
     "config_updates": ["Add REDIS_URL environment variable"],
     "backward_compatible": true,
     "rollback_complexity": "LOW",
     "deployment_risk": "MEDIUM"
   }
   ```

   **Memory Pattern**: `code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-3/devops-engineer/deployment-impact`

3. **User Impact Assessment**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow agent spawn --type planner --focus "user-impact"
   ```

   **Product Manager** assesses:
   - Does this improve user experience?
   - Any user-facing changes? (UI/UX)
   - Consistent with design system?
   - Analytics/tracking updated?
   - Feature flags needed?

   **Findings**:
   ```json
   {
     "user_facing_changes": ["New export functionality in dashboard"],
     "ux_impact": "POSITIVE",
     "design_system_compliant": true,

   npx claude-flow memory retrieve --pattern "code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-3/*"
   npx claude-flow agent spawn --type reviewer --focus "risk-analysis"
   ```

   **Code Reviewer** analyzes:
   - What's the blast radius of this change? (how many users/services affected)
   - Worst-case failure scenario? (data loss, downtime, security breach)
   - Do we have rollback procedures? (tested and documented)
   - Should this be feature-flagged? (gradual rollout)
   - Is monitoring and alerting adequate? (can detect issues quickly)

   **Risk Matrix**:
   ```json
   {
     "blast_radius": "MEDIUM (affects 30% of users)",
     "worst_case_scenario": "Temporary export failures (no data loss)",
     "rollback_available": true,
     "rollback_tested": false,
     "feature_flag_needed": true,
     "monitoring_adequate": true,
     "overall_risk": "MEDIUM",
     "recommendation": "CONDITIONAL_APPROVE (add feature flag + test rollback)"
   }
   ```

   **Memory Pattern**: `code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-3/code-reviewer/risk-analysis`

**Outputs**:
- Integration test results
- Deployment impact report
- User impact assessment
- Risk analysis with mitigation recommendations

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Deployment plan documented
- [ ] User impact understood
- [ ] Risk assessment complete with mitigation

### Phase 4: Final Approval (30 Minutes, Decision & Notification)

**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Execution Mode**: Sequential synthesis and decision
**Agents**: `pr-manager`

**Process**:

1. **Generate Final Review Summary**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow memory retrieve --pattern "code-review/${PR_ID}/**"
   npx claude-flow agent spawn --type pr-manager --focus "final-summary"
   ```

   **PR Manager** synthesizes all phases:

   **Summary Report**:
   ```markdown
   # Code Review Summary: PR #${PR_NUMBER}

   ## Automated Checks ✅
   - Linting: ✅ PASS (0 violations)
   - Tests: ✅ PASS (142/142 passing)
   - Coverage: ✅ PASS (93.5%, +2.3% delta)
   - Build: ✅ PASS (clean build, no warnings)

   ## Specialized Reviews
   - **Code Quality**: 4/5 stars (Good quality, minor improvements suggested)
   - **Security**: ⚠️ 1 HIGH issue (SQL injection risk in user query)
   - **Performance**: ⚠️ 1 HIGH impact (N+1 query problem)
   - **Architecture**: ⚠️ 1 MAJOR concern (tight coupling to payment provider)
   - **Documentation**: 75% complete (missing API docs + changelog)

   ## Integration Analysis
   - **Integration Tests**: ✅ All passing (45/45)
   - **Deployment Impact**: MEDIUM risk (requires Redis + DB migration)
   - **User Impact**: POSITIVE (new export feature)
   - **Risk Level**: MEDIUM (feature flag recommended)

   ## Blocking Issues (MUST FIX)
   1. [HIGH/SECURITY] SQL injection risk in src/api/users.ts:78
   2. [HIGH/PERFORMANCE] N+1 query in src/services/user-service.ts:125

   ## High-Priority Recommendations (SHOULD FIX)
   3. [MAJOR/ARCHITECTURE] Decouple payment service from Stripe SDK
   4. [MEDIUM/DOCUMENTATION] Add API documentation for webhook endpoint
   5. [MEDIUM/DEPLOYMENT] Add feature flag for gradual rollout

   ## Overall Decision: ⏸️ REQUEST CHANGES

   **Rationale**: Code is high quality overall, but 2 blocking issues (security + performance) must be addressed before merge. Once fixed, this PR will be ready for production.

   **Next Steps**:
   1. Author fixes blocking issues (estimated 2-4 hours)
   2. Re-run automated checks + security/performance reviews
   3. Once green, approve for merge with feature flag enabled
   ```

   **Memory Storage**:
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow memory store --key "code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-4/final-summary" \
     --value "${FINAL_SUMMARY_MARKDOWN}"
   ```

2. **Determine Decision**

   **Decision Logic**:
   ```javascript
   function determineDecision(aggregatedReview) {
     const { blocking, highPriority, security, performance } = aggregatedReview;

     // REJECT: Fundamental architectural problems or severe quality issues
     if (blocking.length > 5 || security.critical > 0) {
       return {
         decision: 'REJECT',
         message: 'Too many critical issues or fundamental architectural problems. Consider alternative approach.'
       };
     }

     // REQUEST CHANGES: Blocking issues that must be fixed
     if (blocking.length > 0 || security.high > 0 || performance.high > 0) {
       return {
         decision: 'REQUEST_CHANGES',
         message: `${blocking.length} blocking issue(s) must be fixed before merge.`
       };
     }

     // CONDITIONAL APPROVE: High-priority items should be addressed
     if (highPriority.length > 0) {
       return {
         decision: 'CONDITIONAL_APPROVE',
         message: `Approved with ${highPriority.length} recommendations to address before or after merge.`
       };
     }

     // APPROVE: All quality gates passed
     return {
       decision: 'APPROVE',
       message: 'All quality checks passed. Ready to merge.'
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Notify Author**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow agent spawn --type pr-manager --focus "author-notification"
   ```

   **PR Manager** sends notification:
   - GitHub PR comment with full review summary
   - Label PR appropriately ("changes-requested", "approved", "rejected")
   - Assign back to author (if changes needed)
   - Tag relevant reviewers for specific issues

   **GitHub PR Comment** (example for REQUEST_CHANGES):

## Memory Coordination

### Namespace Convention

All review data follows this hierarchical pattern:

```
code-review/{pr-id}/phase-{N}/{reviewer-type}/{findings-type}
```

**Examples**:
- `code-review/repo/pulls/123/metadata`
- `code-review/repo/pulls/123/phase-1/code-analyzer/lint-results`
- `code-review/repo/pulls/123/phase-2/security-manager/security-review`
- `code-review/repo/pulls/123/phase-3/devops-engineer/deployment-impact`
- `code-review/repo/pulls/123/phase-4/final-summary`

### Cross-Phase Data Flow

**Phase 1 → Phase 2**:
```bash
# Phase 2 reviewers check if Phase 1 passed
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --pattern "code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-1/*/results"

# Only proceed if all automated checks passed
if [ "$(jq '.all_passed' < phase1_results.json)" = "true" ]; then
  # Spawn specialist reviewers
  npx claude-flow task orchestrate --strategy parallel
fi
```

**Phase 2 → Phase 3**:
```bash
# Phase 3 integration analysis references specialist findings
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --pattern "code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-2/security-manager/security-review"
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --pattern "code-review/${PR_ID}/phase-2/performance-analyzer/performance-review"

# Risk analysis considers all specialist findings
```

**Phase 3 → Phase 4**:
```bash
# Phase 4 final decision aggregates all prior phases
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --pattern "code-review/${PR_ID}/**"

# Generate comprehensive summary
```

## !! SKILL COMPLETION VERIFICATION (MANDATORY) !!

**After invoking this skill, you MUST complete ALL items below before proceeding:**

### Completion Checklist

- [ ] **Agent Spawning**: Did you spawn at least 1 agent via Task()?
  - Example: `Task("Agent Name", "Task description", "agent-type-from-registry")`

- [ ] **Agent Registry Validation**: Is your agent from the registry?
  - Registry location: `claude-code-plugins/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system/agents/`
  - Valid categories: delivery, foundry, operations, orchestration, platforms, quality, research, security, specialists, tooling
  - NOT valid: Made-up agent names

- [ ] **TodoWrite Called**: Did you call TodoWrite with 5+ todos?
  - Example: `TodoWrite({ todos: [8-10 items covering all work] })`

- [ ] **Work Delegation**: Did you delegate to agents (not do work yourself)?
  - CORRECT: Agents do the implementation via Task()
  - WRONG: You write the code directly after reading skill

### Correct Pattern After Skill Invocation

```javascript
// After Skill("<skill-name>") is invoked:
[Single Message - ALL in parallel]:
  Task("Agent 1", "Description of task 1...", "agent-type-1")
  Task("Agent 2", "Description of task 2...", "agent-type-2")
  Task("Agent 3", "Description of task 3...", "agent-type-3")
  TodoWrite({ todos: [
    {content: "Task 1 description", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Working on task 1"},
    {content: "Task 2 description", status: "pending", activeForm: "Working on task 2"},
    {content: "Task 3 description", status: "pending", activeForm: "Working on task 3"},
  ]})
```

### Wrong Pattern (DO NOT DO THIS)

```javascript
// WRONG - Reading skill and then doing work yourself:
Skill("<skill-name>")
// Then you write all the code yourself without Task() calls
// This defeats the purpose of the skill system!
```

**The skill is NOT complete until all checklist items are checked.**

---

**Remember the pattern: Skill() -> Task() -> TodoWrite() - ALWAYS**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Automated Gates Before Human Review
**Principle**: Fast-failing automated checks (linting, tests, coverage, build) must pass before expensive specialist reviews begin. No human should review code that fails basic quality gates.

**In practice**:
- Phase 1 runs automated checks in parallel completing within 30 minutes
- Linting violations, test failures, or build errors trigger immediate author notification
- Phase 2 specialist reviews only begin after all Phase 1 checks pass green
- Automated gate prevents wasted reviewer time analyzing code with obvious defects
- Author fixes issues and re-submits triggering fresh Phase 1 run before review resumes

### 2. Parallel Specialist Reviews for Comprehensive Coverage
**Principle**: Code quality requires evaluation across multiple dimensions (security, performance, architecture, documentation) by domain experts reviewing concurrently.

**In practice**:
- Star topology spawns 10 specialist reviewers in parallel during Phase 2
- Each specialist focuses deeply on their domain without distraction from other concerns
- Security reviewer analyzes OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and auth/auth correctness
- Performance reviewer identifies algorithmic inefficiencies and resource leaks
- Architecture reviewer validates design patterns and integration consistency
- Findings from all specialists aggregate into comprehensive assessment

### 3. Risk-Based Decision Making with Evidence
**Principle**: Merge decisions must be deterministic based on severity-weighted findings, not subjective gut feel. Evidence drives recommendations.

**In practice**:
- Critical severity issues automatically block merge requiring fixes before approval
- High severity issues (security, performance regressions) request changes with specific remediation
- Medium severity issues conditionally approve with recommendations to address
- Low severity issues approve with suggestions for future improvement
- Decision logic codified in deterministic algorithm ensuring consistency across PRs

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Skipping Automated Checks** | Proceeding directly to human review without automated validation wastes specialist time reviewing code with linting violations, failing tests, or broken builds. | Implement mandatory Phase 1 automated gate. No specialist reviews begin until all automated checks pass. Author must fix issues before review proceeds. Enforce with CI/CD pipeline checks. |
| **Single Reviewer Bottleneck** | One generalist reviewer attempts to evaluate all quality dimensions (code, security, performance, architecture) resulting in shallow review missing domain-specific issues. | Deploy star topology with 10 specialist reviewers operating in parallel. Each reviewer focuses deeply on their domain expertise. Aggregate findings into comprehensive assessment covering all dimensions. |
| **Merge Without Risk Assessment** | Approving PRs based solely on code quality without analyzing deployment impact, integration risk, or rollback complexity leads to production incidents. | Add Phase 3 integration analysis evaluating deployment impact, database migrations, backward compatibility, and rollback procedures. Risk assessment informs merge decision and deployment strategy (feature flags, gradual rollout). |

## Conclusion

Comprehensive code review orchestration transforms manual, inconsistent review processes into systematic workflows that evaluate PRs across security, performance, architecture, documentation, and integration dimensions within 4 hours. The star topology coordination pattern enables 10+ specialists to review concurrently while maintaining coherence through centralized PR manager aggregation. Automated gates prevent wasted human effort by fast-failing obvious defects before expensive specialist reviews begin.

The workflow's effectiveness stems from balancing speed with thoroughness - Phase 1 automated checks complete in 30 minutes providing immediate feedback, while Phase 2 parallel specialist reviews achieve comprehensive coverage without sequential bottlenecks. The deterministic decision logic in Phase 4 eliminates subjective merge decisions, basing recommendations on severity-weighted findings rather than gut feel. This consistency builds team confidence that review quality remains high regardless of which specialists are available.

Memory coordination enables specialists to reference findings from other reviewers, preventing duplicate work and creating holistic assessments. The security reviewer can reference performance issues when evaluating authentication flows, while the architecture reviewer considers deployment complexity identified by DevOps analysis. This cross-referencing elevates individual specialist insights into collective intelligence greater than sum of parts. Teams implementing this workflow should resist the temptation to skip phases or compress timelines during crunch periods - the 4-hour duration reflects realistic minimum time for thorough multi-dimensional analysis. Rushing reviews surfaces as production incidents that cost far more than modest PR review delays.
