# Finishing Development Branches

## Quick Start

1. **Code Complete** - All acceptance criteria met, edge cases handled, no TODOs
2. **Quality Assurance** - Tests pass, coverage met, lint clean, build succeeds
3. **Documentation** - README, API docs, inline comments updated
4. **Git Hygiene** - Rebase on main, clean commit history, no conflicts
5. **PR Ready** - Complete description, screenshots, reviewers assigned

## Features

| Feature | Description | Guide |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Code Completeness | All requirements implemented | Check acceptance criteria, edge cases, cleanup |
| Quality Gates | Automated validation | Tests, lint, types, security, build |
| TODO Scanner | Find unaddressed items | `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX` patterns |
| Git Preparation | Clean history for merge | Rebase, squash WIP, conventional commits |
| PR Generation | Comprehensive description | Summary, changes, testing, screenshots |
| Verification Script | Final pre-PR check | Run all gates, generate report |

## Common Patterns

```
# Completion Checklist
PHASE 1: CODE COMPLETE
[ ] All acceptance criteria implemented
[ ] Edge cases handled
[ ] Error handling complete
[ ] No TODO/FIXME unaddressed
[ ] Debug code removed

PHASE 2: QUALITY ASSURANCE
[ ] All tests passing
[ ] Coverage meets threshold (80%+)
[ ] Lint/format passing
[ ] Type checking passing
[ ] Security scan passing

PHASE 3: DOCUMENTATION
[ ] README updated if needed
[ ] API documentation updated
[ ] Complex logic commented

PHASE 4: GIT HYGIENE
[ ] Rebased on latest main
[ ] Commit history clean
[ ] Conventional commit messages
[ ] No merge conflicts

PHASE 5: PR READY
[ ] Description complete
[ ] Screenshots for UI changes
[ ] Reviewers assigned
```

```bash
# Git Preparation
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# Review commits for squashing
git log --oneline main..HEAD
# Consider squashing: fix, wip, temp commits
git rebase -i main

# Push with lease (safe force)
git push origin feature-branch --force-with-lease

# Quality verification
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build
```

```
# PR Description Template
## Summary
[2-3 sentences on what/why]

## Changes
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [ ] Manual testing

## Screenshots
[For UI changes]

## Checklist
- [x] Self-review completed
- [x] Tests pass
- [x] Documentation updated
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Avoid |
|----|-------|
| Run all checks locally before pushing | Pushing broken code |
| Rebase on latest main to avoid conflicts | Force pushing without --force-with-lease |
| Squash WIP commits into meaningful units | Leaving fix/wip/temp commits |
| Write clear conventional commit messages | Cryptic commit messages |
| Include screenshots for UI changes | Creating PRs without descriptions |
| Self-review your diff before requesting | Leaving debug statements in code |
| Test in clean environment if possible | Skipping tests to save time |
| Link to related tickets in PR | Ignoring linting warnings |
