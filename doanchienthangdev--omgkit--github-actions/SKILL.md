# Automating with GitHub Actions

## Quick Start

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
```

## Features

| Feature | Description | Guide |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Workflows | Event-driven automation pipelines | Trigger on push, PR, schedule, or manual dispatch |
| Jobs | Parallel or sequential task execution | Use `needs` for dependencies, matrix for variations |
| Actions | Reusable workflow components | Use marketplace actions or create custom composite |
| Environments | Deployment targets with protection | Configure approvals, secrets, and URLs |
| Artifacts | Build output persistence | Upload/download between jobs, retention policies |
| Caching | Dependency caching for speed | Cache npm, pip, gradle directories |

## Common Patterns

### Matrix Build

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
        node: [18, 20, 22]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - run: npm ci && npm test
```

### Deployment with Environments

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://example.com
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci && npm run build
      - name: Deploy
        run: ./deploy.sh
        env:
          DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
```

### Docker Build and Push

```yaml
jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
      - uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Avoid |
|----|-------|
| Use concurrency groups to cancel stale runs | Hardcoding secrets in workflows |
| Cache dependencies for faster builds | Skipping security scanning |
| Use matrix strategies for cross-platform | Using deprecated action versions |
| Implement environment protection rules | Running unnecessary jobs on PRs |
| Set timeouts on long-running jobs | Ignoring workflow permissions |
| Use reusable workflows for common patterns | Self-hosted runners without security review |
| Upload test artifacts on failure | Skipping concurrency controls |
