# Architecting Omega Systems

Build **scalable, resilient, and future-proof systems** following the 7 Omega Principles for platform-grade architecture.

## Quick Start

```yaml
# 1. Define architectural requirements
Architecture:
  Name: "E-commerce Platform"
  Scale: "1M+ concurrent users"
  Principles: [leverage, abstraction, agentic, antifragile]

# 2. Apply Omega decision framework
Decision:
  Question: "Monolith or microservices?"
  Omega_Check:
    - Leverage: "Does this multiply capability?"
    - Scale: "Zero-marginal-cost at 1000x?"
    - Resilience: "Self-healing under stress?"

# 3. Design with antifragility
Pattern: Event-Driven + Circuit Breakers + Auto-Scaling
```

## Features

| Feature | Description | Guide |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| 7 Omega Principles | Core architectural tenets for scalable systems | Apply all 7 to every decision |
| Leverage Architecture | Systems that amplify effort, not add to it | Build frameworks, not features |
| Agentic Services | Autonomous, self-healing microservices | Circuit breakers + health monitors |
| Zero-Marginal-Cost | Platform economics at scale | Edge compute + aggressive caching |
| Event-Driven Design | Loose coupling via event bus | Kafka/Redis streams + sagas |
| Antifragile Patterns | Systems that strengthen under stress | Chaos engineering + adaptive config |
| Decision Framework | Systematic architecture evaluation | Omega checklist for every choice |

## Common Patterns

### The 7 Omega Principles

```
1. LEVERAGE MULTIPLICATION   - Build systems that amplify effort
2. TRANSCENDENT ABSTRACTION  - Solve classes of problems
3. AGENTIC DECOMPOSITION     - Autonomous, self-managing services
4. RECURSIVE IMPROVEMENT     - Systems that optimize themselves
5. ZERO-MARGINAL-COST        - No cost per user at scale
6. ANTIFRAGILE DESIGN        - Grow stronger under stress
7. COMPOSABLE PRIMITIVES     - Lego blocks that combine infinitely
```

### Leverage Architecture Pattern

```typescript
// ONE implementation handles ALL entity types
class LeveragedEntitySystem {
  async create<T>(type: string, data: T): Promise<T> {
    const validated = await this.validators.get(type)?.validate(data);
    await this.runHooks(type, 'beforeCreate', validated);
    const result = await this.storage.create(type, validated);
    await this.runHooks(type, 'afterCreate', result);
    return result as T;
  }

  // New entity = configuration, not code
  registerEntityType(type: string, config: EntityConfig): void {
    this.validators.set(type, createValidator(config.schema));
  }
}
```

### Agentic Service Pattern

```typescript
abstract class AgenticService {
  private circuitBreaker: CircuitBreaker;
  private healthMonitor: HealthMonitor;
  private autoScaler: AutoScaler;

  constructor() {
    // Self-monitoring
    this.healthMonitor = new HealthMonitor({
      onUnhealthy: () => this.selfHeal()
    });

    // Self-protecting
    this.circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker({
      failureThreshold: 5,
      onOpen: () => this.notifyDegradation()
    });
  }

  protected async executeWithResilience<T>(
    operation: () => Promise<T>,
    fallback?: () => T
  ): Promise<T> {
    return this.circuitBreaker.execute(operation, fallback);
  }
}
```

### Zero-Marginal-Cost Pattern

```typescript
// Edge-first architecture
const platformConfig = {
  compute: { provider: 'cloudflare-workers', pricing: 'per-invocation' },
  storage: { provider: 'r2', cdn: { enabled: true, ttl: '1y' } },
  database: { provider: 'planetscale', sharding: 'automatic' },
  cache: {
    layers: [
      { type: 'browser', ttl: '1h' },
      { type: 'cdn-edge', ttl: '24h' },
      { type: 'origin', ttl: '5m' }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Event-Driven Saga Pattern

```typescript
class OrderSaga {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus) {
    eventBus.subscribe('order.created', this.handleOrderCreated);
    eventBus.subscribe('payment.failed', this.handlePaymentFailed);
  }

  handleOrderCreated = async (event: DomainEvent<Order>) => {
    await this.eventBus.publish({
      type: 'inventory.reserve',
      data: { orderId: event.data.id, items: event.data.items },
      correlationId: event.correlationId
    });
  };

  handlePaymentFailed = async (event: DomainEvent) => {
    // Compensating action
    await this.eventBus.publish({ type: 'inventory.release', ... });
    await this.eventBus.publish({ type: 'order.cancelled', ... });
  };
}
```

### Architecture Decision Template

```markdown
## Omega Architecture Decision

### Context
[Problem and constraints]

### Omega Principles Check
| Principle | Question | Assessment |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Leverage | Does this multiply capability? | |
| Abstraction | Solving class of problems? | |
| Agentic | Can it operate autonomously? | |
| Recursive | Will it self-improve? | |
| Zero-Marginal | Sub-linear cost scaling? | |
| Antifragile | Stronger under stress? | |
| Composable | Combines with other components? | |

### Scale Analysis
- 10x load: [Impact]
- 100x load: [Impact]
- 1000x load: [Impact]

### Decision
[Chosen approach with rationale]
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Avoid |
|----|-------|
| Apply all 7 Omega principles to every decision | Building monoliths that cannot decompose |
| Design for 1000x scale from day one | Tight coupling between services |
| Use event-driven patterns for loose coupling | Ignoring failure modes in design |
| Implement circuit breakers at all boundaries | Scaling vertically when horizontal is possible |
| Build self-healing capabilities into services | Hardcoding configuration values |
| Measure and optimize cost per transaction | Skipping capacity planning |
| Document decisions using ADR template | Deploying without health checks |
| Test failure scenarios with chaos engineering | Synchronous calls for non-critical paths |
| Use infrastructure as code | Ignoring data consistency requirements |
| Implement observability everywhere | Underestimating distributed system complexity |
