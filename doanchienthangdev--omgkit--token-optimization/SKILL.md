# Optimizing Tokens

## Quick Start

1. **Analyze** - Identify input vs output token distribution
2. **Minimize Context** - Read only relevant file sections, not entire files
3. **Optimize Prompts** - Use direct commands, remove filler words
4. **Structure Outputs** - Request concise formats (JSON over prose)
5. **Batch Operations** - Combine related requests, avoid duplicate context
6. **Select Model** - Match model tier to task complexity

## Features

| Feature | Description | Guide |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Context Targeting | Read only needed code sections | Line ranges, pattern search, summaries |
| Prompt Efficiency | Direct commands vs verbose requests | 79% reduction possible |
| Output Formatting | Structured concise responses | JSON/YAML over verbose explanations |
| Model Selection | Right model for task complexity | Haiku: simple, Sonnet: standard, Opus: complex |
| Batching | Combine related operations | Single request with multiple outputs |
| Caching | Avoid redundant computation | Cache by content hash + timestamp |

## Common Patterns

```
# Prompt Optimization (79% reduction)
INEFFICIENT (120 tokens):
"I would really appreciate it if you could help me
with this task. What I need you to do is to please
analyze this code and look for any bugs..."

EFFICIENT (25 tokens):
"Analyze for bugs, error handling issues, security.
For each: location, problem, fix."

# Context Optimization
INEFFICIENT: Read entire 1000-line file
EFFICIENT: Read lines 45-60 around target function

# Output Format
INEFFICIENT: "Please explain in detail..."
EFFICIENT: "Output: JSON {name, severity, fix}"

# Batching
INEFFICIENT:
  Request 1: "Given code [100 lines], find bugs"
  Request 2: "Given code [same 100 lines], add types"

EFFICIENT:
  Single request: "Given code [100 lines]:
  1. Find bugs
  2. Add types"
```

```
# Model Selection Guide
| Task Type | Model | Examples |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Simple | Haiku | Formatting, syntax check, lookups |
| Standard | Sonnet | Features, bugs, reviews, tests |
| Complex | Opus | Architecture, security, critical code |

# Search Efficiency
INEFFICIENT: grep ".*" / (matches everything)
EFFICIENT: grep "handleAuth" src/ --type ts
```

## Best Practices

| Do | Avoid |
|----|-------|
| Read only what's needed - use line ranges | Reading entire files for one function |
| Use direct language - commands over requests | Verbose, polite phrasing in prompts |
| Structure outputs - JSON/YAML over prose | Requesting detailed explanations for simple tasks |
| Batch operations - combine related requests | Repeating context across multiple requests |
| Choose right model - Haiku for simple tasks | Using most powerful model for everything |
| Limit search results - use head_limit | Unbounded searches returning thousands of results |
| Cache results - avoid redundant computation | Re-analyzing unchanged files |
| Progressive loading - start minimal, expand | Loading full context when partial suffices |
