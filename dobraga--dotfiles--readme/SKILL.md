# README Generator (Python Edition)

You are an expert technical writer. Your goal is to create a Python README.md that is so thorough it eliminates "onboarding friction" entirely.

## Before Writing: Python-Specific Exploration

### Step 1: Deep Codebase Exploration
**Environment & Dependencies**
- Identify the manager: `pyproject.toml` (Poetry/UV/Hatch), `requirements.txt` (pip), or `environment.yml` (Conda).
- Entry Points: Look for `main.py`, `app.py`, `__main__.py`, or `[project.scripts]` in `pyproject.toml`.

**Framework Detection**
- **FastAPI/Litestar**: Look for `app = FastAPI()`.
- **Flask**: Look for `Flask(__name__)`.
- **CLI**: Look for `click`, `typer`, or `argparse`.

**Data & Type Safety**
- Check for `pydantic` models (Common in modern Python).
- Check for `SQLModel`, `SQLAlchemy`, `Tortoise` for DB schemas.

## README Structure (Python)

### 1. Project Title and Tech Stack
Include version requirements (e.g., Python 3.10+ for Union types `|`).

```markdown
## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **Environment Manager**: [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- **Framework**: FastAPI / Flask
- **Validation/Settings**: Pydantic v2
- **Linter/Formatter**: Ruff
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / Redis
```

### 2. Getting Started (The Modern Way)

Provide instructions for the specific tool found (UV is preferred in 2026 for speed).

```markdown
## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed (recommended)
- Python 3.12+
- Docker Desktop (for services)

### 2. Local Setup
\`\`\`bash
# Clone and enter
git clone <repo-url> && cd <repo-name>

# Create virtualenv and install deps (using uv)
uv sync

# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate
\`\`\`

### 3. Environment Configuration
List variables and their purpose in a table. Explain `pydantic-settings` if used.

```

### 3. Architecture Overview (Pythonic Depth)

```markdown
## Architecture

### Directory Structure
Explain the layout (e.g., `src/` layout vs. flat layout).

### Data Flow
Explain how a request/command moves through:
1. **Entrypoint**: `api/v1/endpoints` or `cli.py`
2. **Validation**: Pydantic schemas
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic (independent of framework)
4. **Data Access**: Repository pattern / ORM models

### Pydantic Models & Schemas
Document the core data shapes.

```

### 4. Available Commands (Makefile / Taskfile)

Python projects often use a `Makefile` or `pyproject.toml` scripts. Document them clearly.

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `uv run ruff check` | Linting with Ruff |
| `uv run ruff format` | Formatting code |
| `pytest` | Run test suite |
| `python -m src.main` | Start the application |

### 5. Deployment (Python-Centric)

Tailor based on detected files:

* **Dockerfile**: Explain the multi-stage build (using `python:3.12-slim`).
* **fly.toml / vercel.json**: Python-specific deployment steps.
* **Gunicorn/Uvicorn**: Document worker configurations and process management.

### 6. Troubleshooting (The Python "Gotchas")

* **Pydantic ValidationErrors**: How to read them.
* **Circular Imports**: Common in growing Python projects.
* **AsyncIO issues**: If using `async`/`await`.
* **Migrations**: `alembic upgrade head` or `manage.py migrate`.

## Writing Principles

1. **Prefer `uv` or `poetry**`: Standard `pip` is often too slow/manual for modern READMEs.
2. **Type Hinting**: Assume the user is using static analysis (Mypy/Pyright).
3. **Virtual Environments**: Always assume the user should be in a `.venv`.

```

### How to use this
When you want to document a Python project, trigger this by saying **"Generate a thorough Python README"**. 

**Would you like me to analyze your current directory and draft a README.md based on the files I find?**
