## Workflow

### 1. Search — `docfork:search_docs`

**library**: Start with a short name or keyword (e.g., `nextjs`, `react router`) — this triggers multi-library search with server-side reranking. Once a result is returned, extract the `owner/repo` from its URL and use that exact form for any follow-up calls to pin to the verified repository.

**query**: Specific and descriptive — e.g., `"server actions in Next.js App Router"` not `"next.js actions"`. Include version if specified (e.g., `"React 19 concurrent features"`).

Each result returns a `title`, `description`, and `url`. Prefer canonical/official repos over forks. Retry with a broader or different query if results are empty or off-target.

> **3 calls maximum across the entire request.**

### 2. Fetch - `docfork:fetch_doc`

Search results are summaries. **Call `fetch_doc` to get the actual content - this is the default next step after a relevant result, not a last resort.**

Two URL modes, both derived from search result URLs:

**Exact chunk** - pass the URL as-is, keeping the line anchor (`#L40-L85`):
```
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/main/docs/routing/middleware.mdx#L40-L85
```

**Table of contents** - strip the filename and anchor, pass the parent path:
```
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/main/docs/routing/
```
Returns a TOC with previews across that directory - use when you need broader context before committing to a specific chunk.

If a chunk's description is truncated or vague, fetch it - descriptions are previews only.
