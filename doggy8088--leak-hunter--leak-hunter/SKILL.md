# Leak Hunter

Prefer JSON output for agent workflows:

```bash
leak-hunter --json --min-risk 40 .
```

If running inside this source tree:

```bash
cargo run --quiet -- --json --min-risk 40 .
```

Keep redaction enabled unless the user explicitly asks for raw values. Do not publish unredacted reports.
