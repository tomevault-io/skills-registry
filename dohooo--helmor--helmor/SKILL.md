description: Prepare Helmor releases by inspecting the current branch, drafting a concise user-facing Changesets entry first (bump + body — keep it as short as possible), creating any needed pending in-app release announcement under `.announcements/`, and then showing the user the result with a short menu of adjustments they can pick from. Use when the user wants to cut a release, write a changeset, decide patch/minor/major, draft GitHub release notes, create a release announcement, or summarize branch changes into release-ready language. Use when this capability is needed.

# Helmor Release

Use this skill to turn a branch's real changes into release metadata for Helmor:

- a clean `.changeset/*.md` entry
- a pending `.announcements/*.json` fragment when the change deserves an in-app "New in vX" toast

## Workflow

1. Inspect the branch before asking the user anything.
2. Run `scripts/collect_release_context.py` to gather:
   - commits since the base branch
   - changed files grouped by area
   - a short suggested summary
3. Draft the full changeset yourself, without asking the user upfront. Decide:
   - the bump (`patch` / `minor` / `major`) using the Versioning Guidance below
   - the body shape — **one prose sentence** when one sentence is genuinely enough, or **summary line + bullets** when there are multiple distinct user-visible changes (see Default Changeset Format)
   - the actual prose / bullets

   Prefer a conservative bump (`patch` unless there is a clear new user-visible capability). If you genuinely cannot decide the bump from the diff alone, default to `patch` and flag it in the confirmation step.

   **Brevity bias.** Aim for the shortest sentence that names the user-visible change — if a clause can be dropped without losing meaning, drop it. Reserve summary+bullets for releases with ≥2 distinct user-visible items.
4. Write the changeset to a single file under `.changeset/` right away. Do not wait for approval before creating the file — the user will adjust from a real draft, not a hypothetical one.
5. Decide whether an in-app release announcement is warranted.
   - Create one pending file under `.announcements/` only for new user-visible features or workflow changes.
   - Skip bug fixes, internal refactors, routine performance work, and release plumbing unless users need to learn a new behavior.
   - Do not write an id or version. `bun run release:version` consumes all pending announcement files and merges them into one catalog entry for the final version.
6. Then, and only then, show the user what you created and offer the adjustment menu described in "Confirmation Style".

## Confirmation Style

Do not ask the user anything before the draft is written. Once the changeset file exists, report what you created and offer a short menu of adjustments.

Preferred pattern:

1. State the file path you created.
2. If you created a release announcement fragment, state that file path too.
3. Echo back the chosen bump, the changeset body, and the announcement text if present.
4. Present a numbered menu of the things the user might want to change. The user picks any subset (e.g. "1 and 3") or says nothing / "looks good" to accept. Never phrase this as an open question like "do you approve?".

Example (Shape A — single sentence):

```text
I've written .changeset/brave-otters-smile.md:

  bump: patch
  body: Fix the context-usage ring resetting to zero when switching the active model.

If you want to adjust anything, tell me which:
  1. Version bump (currently: patch — say "make it minor" / "make it major")
  2. Rewrite the body
  3. Add or revise an in-app release announcement
  4. Expand into summary + bullets
  5. Add a thanks/credits line

Otherwise we're done — no reply needed.
```

Example (Shape B — multi-change):

```text
I've written .changeset/brave-otters-smile.md:
I've also written .announcements/release-and-updates.json:

  bump:    minor
  summary: Ship a round of release and auto-update improvements:
  bullets:
    - Add in-app update checks that download updates in the background ...
    - Add a signed and notarized macOS release pipeline ...
    - Add release planning automation ...

If you want to adjust anything, tell me which:
  1. Version bump (currently: minor — say "make it patch" / "make it major")
  2. Summary line
  3. The bullet list (add / remove / rewrite specific items)
  4. In-app announcement text
  5. Collapse to a single sentence
  6. Add a thanks/credits line

Otherwise we're done — no reply needed.
```

If structured choice tools are unavailable, present the menu in plain text and let the user reply naturally.

## Changeset Rules

Write changesets for users, not for maintainers.

Do:

- explain what changed from the user's point of view, as briefly as possible
- use **one sentence** when one sentence cleanly conveys the change
- use **summary line + bullets** only when there are multiple distinct user-visible changes
- keep prose / bullets concrete and outcome-focused
- mention new workflows or capabilities
- include a short thanks line only if the user explicitly wants credits

Do not:

- dump commit messages verbatim
- list internal refactors unless they changed release behavior
- mention implementation-only details like exact file names
- create multiple changesets for one coordinated release task unless the user asks
- pad a single-change PR with bullets just to fit the summary+bullets template
- start the changeset body with a `- ` bullet (see format rule below)

## Default Changeset Format

The body has **two allowed shapes**. Pick the smallest one that fits.

**Shape A — single sentence.** Use this when one self-contained sentence captures the entire user-visible change. This is the default for most patch-level fixes and small polish PRs. Keep it as short as possible.

**Shape B — summary line + bullets.** Use this only when there are ≥2 distinct user-visible changes worth enumerating. The first line is a prose summary (usually ending with `:`); each concrete change is a `- ` sub-item underneath.

`@changesets/changelog-github` inlines the first line of the body after `Thanks @user! -` when rendering `CHANGELOG.md` / GitHub Release. A single prose sentence renders cleanly. A leading `- ` would produce `! - - Fix X` with the first item glued to the attribution. **Never start the body with `- `.**

Decision rule: if you find yourself writing a summary that just restates the one bullet underneath it, collapse to Shape A. If a single sentence would force you to cram multiple ideas with "and"/";", expand to Shape B.

### Shape A example (single sentence)

```md
---
"helmor": patch
---

Fix a Chinese IME regression in the composer so pressing Enter to confirm an IME candidate no longer accidentally sends the message.
```

### Shape B example (multi-change)

First line is a prose summary ending with `:`. Bullets start from the next line:

```md
---
"helmor": minor
---

Ship a round of release and auto-update improvements:
- Add in-app update checks that download updates in the background and prompt once the update is ready to install.
- Add a signed and notarized macOS release pipeline for GitHub Releases.
- Add release planning automation so Helmor can publish user-facing release notes through Changesets.
```

This renders cleanly as:

```md
- [#NN] [`hash`] Thanks @user! - Ship a round of release and auto-update improvements:
  - Add in-app update checks ...
  - Add a signed and notarized macOS release pipeline ...
  - Add release planning automation ...
```

If the user wants credits, append a final bullet such as:

```md
- Thanks @username for helping validate the release flow.
```

## GitHub Release Notes

Helmor already uses `@changesets/changelog-github` in `.changeset/config.json`.

That means:

- merged PRs and GitHub context are handled by Changesets
- GitHub Release body is derived from `CHANGELOG.md`
- this skill should focus on writing a strong user-facing changeset body

Do not invent a separate release-note format unless the user asks for one.

## In-App Release Announcements

Create a pending announcement fragment when the PR adds a user-visible feature or workflow change that users should learn about in the app.

Do:

- write one short, concrete toast item per user-visible capability
- add an action only when there is a useful direct destination
- use a short kebab-case filename under `.announcements/`
- keep the JSON shape exactly within the schema below

Do not:

- include `id` or `releaseVersion`
- announce ordinary bug fixes, internal refactors, or routine performance work
- edit `src/features/announcements/release-announcement-catalog.json` by hand during feature work

Schema:

```ts
type PendingReleaseAnnouncement = {
	items: Array<{
		text: string;
		action?: {
			label: string;
			value:
				| { type: "openSettings"; section?: SettingsSection }
				| { type: "setRightSidebarMode"; mode: WorkspaceRightSidebarMode };
		};
	}>;
};
```

Allowed `openSettings.section` values come from `src/features/settings`.
Allowed `setRightSidebarMode.mode` values come from `WorkspaceRightSidebarMode` in `src/lib/settings.ts`.

Plain text example:

```json
{
	"items": [
		{
			"text": "You can now drag workspaces in the sidebar to keep each section in your preferred order."
		}
	]
}
```

Action example:

```json
{
	"items": [
		{
			"text": "You can now group workspaces in the sidebar by repository.",
			"action": {
				"label": "Open General",
				"value": { "type": "openSettings", "section": "general" }
			}
		},
		{
			"text": "Add Context now supports GitLab too.",
			"action": {
				"label": "Open Context",
				"value": { "type": "setRightSidebarMode", "mode": "context" }
			}
		}
	]
}
```

At release-plan time, `bun run release:version` consumes every pending fragment, merges all items into one entry for the final package version, and deletes the pending files.

## Versioning Guidance

Recommend:

- `patch` for fixes, polish, and invisible release improvements
- `minor` for new user-visible features or workflows
- `major` only when behavior changes incompatibly

For Helmor's current early lifecycle, prefer `patch` or `minor`. Escalate to `major` only with a concrete breaking change.

## Resources

- Use `scripts/collect_release_context.py` to inspect the current branch before drafting the changeset.
- Use `references/release-format.md` if you need the exact Helmor release flow or writing guidance.
