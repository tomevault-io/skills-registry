# DomainLang modeling

Write DDD architecture models in `.dlang` files. DomainLang is a domain-specific language for expressing Domain-Driven Design concepts as code — domains, bounded contexts, context maps, teams, ownership, ubiquitous language, and integration patterns.

**Reference:** https://domainlang.net

## Workflow

Follow these steps when creating a DomainLang model:

1. **Identify domains** — the high-level business capabilities
2. **Declare teams and classifications** — who owns what, how strategically important
3. **Define bounded contexts** — concrete boundaries with terminology
4. **Map relationships** — how contexts integrate, with DDD patterns
5. **Organize** — use namespaces and imports for large models

## Core syntax

### Domains

```dlang
Domain Sales {
    description: "Revenue generation"
    vision: "Make buying easy"
}

// Subdomains use 'in'
Domain OnlineSales in Sales {
    description: "Digital sales channel"
}
```

Use nouns reflecting business capabilities, not technical terms.

### Teams and classifications

```dlang
Classification CoreDomain
Classification SupportingDomain
Classification GenericSubdomain

Team SalesTeam
Team PlatformTeam
```

Declare these before referencing them in bounded contexts.

### Bounded contexts

```dlang
// Full form with header keywords
BoundedContext Orders for Sales as CoreDomain by SalesTeam {
    description: "Order lifecycle and orchestration"

    terminology {
        term Order: "A customer's request to purchase one or more items"
        term OrderLine: "A single line item representing a product and quantity"
        term OrderStatus: "Current state of an order (Pending, Confirmed, Shipped)"
            aka Status
            examples "Pending", "Confirmed", "Shipped"
    }

    decisions {
        decision EventSourcing: "Capture every state change"
        policy Refunds: "Allow refunds within 30 days"
        rule MinOrder: "Minimum order value is $10"
    }

    metadata {
        Language: "TypeScript"
        Status: "Production"
    }

    relationships {
        this [OHS] -> [CF] Billing
    }
}

// Minimal (body is optional)
BoundedContext Orders for Sales

// Body properties (alternative to header keywords)
BoundedContext Orders for Sales {
    classification: CoreDomain   // Alternative to 'as'
    team: SalesTeam              // Alternative to 'by'
    businessModel: "B2B"
    evolution: "Custom Built"
    archetype: "Execution"
}
```

The `for` keyword links a bounded context to its parent domain.

### Terminology (ubiquitous language)

```dlang
BoundedContext Orders for Sales {
    terminology {
        term Order: "A customer's request to purchase one or more items"
        term OrderLine: "A single line item representing a product and quantity"
        term OrderStatus: "Current state of an order (Pending, Confirmed, Shipped)"
            aka Status
            examples "Pending", "Confirmed", "Shipped"
    }
}
```

Terms support:
- `aka` (or `synonyms`) — alternative names for the term
- `examples` — example values

### Decisions and governance

```dlang
Classification Architectural

BoundedContext Orders for Sales {
    decisions {
        decision EventSourcing: "Capture every state change"
        policy Refunds: "Allow refunds within 30 days"
        rule MinOrder: "Minimum order value is $10"
    }
}
```

Decisions, policies, and rules can be tagged with a classification:

```dlang
BoundedContext Orders for Sales {
    decisions {
        decision [Architectural] EventSourcing: "Capture every state change"
        rule [Architectural] Idempotency: "All write operations must be idempotent"
    }
}
```

### Metadata

Metadata keys must be declared before use:

```dlang
Metadata Status
Metadata Language
Metadata Repository

BoundedContext Orders for Sales {
    metadata {
        Status: "Production"
        Language: "TypeScript"
        Repository: "github.com/acme/orders"
    }
}
```

### Inline relationships

Use the `this` keyword inside a bounded context to define relationships inline:

```dlang
BoundedContext Orders for Sales {
    relationships {
        this [OHS] -> [CF] Billing
        Payments -> [ACL] this
    }
}
```

### Teams and classifications

```dlang
Classification CoreDomain
Classification SupportingDomain
Classification GenericSubdomain

Team SalesTeam
Team PlatformTeam
Team DataTeam
```

### Context maps

```dlang
ContextMap SalesSystem {
    contains Orders, Billing, Shipping, Inventory, Legacy

    Orders [OHS] -> [CF] Billing
    Orders -> [ACL] Shipping
    Orders [P] Inventory
    Orders [SW] Legacy
}
```

#### Relationship arrows

| Arrow | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `->` | Directional — left is upstream, right is downstream |
| `<-` | Reverse directional — right is upstream, left is downstream |
| `<->` | Bidirectional — mutual data flow with explicit patterns |
| `><` | Separate Ways — contexts have no integration |

#### Integration patterns

##### Directional patterns (with `->`, `<-`, and `<->`)

| Pattern | Short | Long form | Side |
| ------- | ----- | --------- | ---- |
| Open Host Service | `[OHS]` | `[OpenHostService]` | Upstream |
| Published Language | `[PL]` | `[PublishedLanguage]` | Upstream |
| Supplier | `[S]` | `[Supplier]` | Upstream |
| Conformist | `[CF]` | `[Conformist]` | Downstream |
| Anti-Corruption Layer | `[ACL]` | `[AntiCorruptionLayer]` | Downstream |
| Customer | `[C]` | `[Customer]` | Downstream |
| Big Ball of Mud | `[BBoM]` | `[BigBallOfMud]` | Either side |

##### Symmetric patterns (no arrow)

Symmetric patterns sit between entities with no arrow. Separate Ways also has the `><` arrow form.

| Pattern | Short | Long form | Arrow form | Description |
| ------- | ----- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Shared Kernel | `[SK]` | `[SharedKernel]` | — | Shared model subset |
| Partnership | `[P]` | `[Partnership]` | — | Coordinated development |
| Separate Ways | `[SW]` | `[SeparateWays]` | `><` | No integration |

**Pattern placement rules:**
- With `->`, `<-`, `<->`: patterns go between the entity and the arrow: `Entity [Pattern] -> [Pattern] Entity`, `Entity [Pattern] <- [Pattern] Entity`, `Entity [Pattern] <-> [Pattern] Entity`
- `[OHS]`, `[PL]`, and `[S]` go on the upstream side
- `[CF]`, `[ACL]`, and `[C]` go on the downstream side
- `[SK]`, `[P]`, and `[SW]` are symmetric — placed between entities with no arrow: `A [SK] B`
- `><` is an arrow form for Separate Ways only: `A >< B` (equivalent to `A [SW] B`)
- Multiple patterns per side: `[OHS, PL]`

```dlang
// ✅ Correct: OHS on upstream, CF on downstream
Orders [OHS] -> [CF] Billing

// ✅ Correct: ACL on downstream (right side)
Orders -> [ACL] Shipping

// ✅ Correct: Shared kernel (symmetric, no arrow)
Orders [SK] Inventory

// ✅ Correct: Customer/Supplier
Orders [S] -> [C] Billing

// ✅ Correct: Separate Ways (three equivalent forms)
Orders [SW] Legacy
Orders [SeparateWays] Legacy
Orders >< Legacy

// ✅ Correct: Reverse directional
Payments [ACL] <- Orders

// ✅ Correct: Bidirectional directional form
Orders [OHS] <-> [CF] Shipping

// ❌ Wrong: CF on upstream side — validator warns
Orders [CF] -> [OHS] Billing
```

#### Relationship semantics

The arrow and pattern determine the relationship type:

| Arrow + Pattern | Relationship type |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| `A -> B` | Upstream/downstream |
| `A <- B` | Reverse upstream/downstream |
| `A <-> B` | Bidirectional |
| `A [S] -> [C] B` | Customer/supplier |
| `A [SK] B` | Shared kernel |
| `A [P] B` | Partnership |
| `A [SW] B` or `A >< B` | Separate ways |

### Domain maps

```dlang
DomainMap Portfolio {
    contains Sales, Support, Platform
}
```

Domain maps reference domains (not bounded contexts) for high-level portfolio visualization.

### Namespaces

```dlang
Namespace Acme.Sales {
    Domain Sales { vision: "Revenue generation" }
    BoundedContext Orders for Sales { }
}

// Reference with fully qualified name
ContextMap System {
    contains Acme.Sales.Orders
}
```

### Standard library (`domainlang/patterns`)

The official standard library provides ready-made DDD classifications and metadata keys.

**Install:**

```bash
dlang add domainlang/patterns@v1.0.0
```

**Usage:**

```dlang
import "domainlang/patterns" as Patterns

BoundedContext Orders for Sales as Patterns.Strategic.CoreDomain by SalesTeam {
    description: "Order lifecycle"
    evolution: Patterns.Evolution.CustomBuilt
    archetype: Patterns.Archetypes.Execution

    metadata {
        Patterns.Meta.Status: "Production"
        Patterns.Meta.Language: "TypeScript"
    }

    decisions {
        decision [Patterns.Governance.Architectural] CQRS:
            "Use CQRS for read/write separation"
    }
}
```

The package namespaces are `Strategic`, `Evolution`, `Archetypes`, `Governance`, and `Meta`. Use an import alias (e.g. `as Patterns`) to qualify references and avoid ambiguity.

**Available namespaces:**

| Namespace | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `Strategic` | `CoreDomain`, `SupportingDomain`, `GenericSubdomain` |
| `Evolution` | `Genesis`, `CustomBuilt`, `Product`, `Commodity` |
| `Archetypes` | `Execution`, `Engagement`, `Analysis`, `Gateway`, `Infrastructure`, `Compliance` |
| `Governance` | `Architectural`, `Organizational`, `Technical`, `Process` |
| `Meta` | `Status`, `Language`, `Repository`, `Documentation`, `SLA`, `DeploymentTarget`, `APIStyle`, `DataStore`, `Criticality` |

Prefer using the standard library over declaring custom classifications for these common DDD concepts.

### Imports

```dlang
// Relative imports
import "./shared/teams.dlang"
import "../common/classifications.dlang"

// Path alias imports (configured in model.yaml)
import "@shared/teams"
import "@domains/sales"

// External package imports
import "acme/ddd-core" as Core

// Use imported types with alias prefix
BoundedContext Orders for Core.SalesDomain as Core.CoreDomain { }
```
