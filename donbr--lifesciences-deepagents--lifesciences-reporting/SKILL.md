# Life Sciences Reporting

Format professional reports from Fuzzy-to-Fact pipeline output using domain-specific templates.

## Grounding Rule

```
ALL claims in the report MUST trace to specific tool calls from Phases 1-5.
Do NOT introduce new entities, drug names, gene functions, or trial IDs from
training knowledge during report generation. The report SYNTHESIZES existing
Phase 1-5 output — it does NOT generate new facts.

If a Phase returned no results for a section, report "No data retrieved" with
the tool name that was called. Do NOT fill gaps from memory.
```

## Scope

**In scope**: Template selection, evidence grading, source attribution, formatting, synthesis of Phase 1-5 output.

**Out of scope**: API calls, data retrieval, new entity resolution, creating new Fuzzy-to-Fact phases, modifying other skills. This skill consumes pipeline output — it does not produce it.

## Template Decision Tree

Route the user's query to the appropriate template using this priority order. If multiple categories apply, combine sections from relevant templates (see Multi-Template Combination below).

```
1. HOW does a drug work?              --> Template 6: Mechanism Elucidation
2. Drug SAFETY or off-targets?        --> Template 7: Safety / Off-Target
3. REGULATORY milestones or filings?  --> Template 5: Regulatory / Commercialization
4. FIND or REPURPOSE drugs?           --> Template 1: Drug Discovery / Repurposing
5. GENE/PROTEIN interactions?         --> Template 2: Gene / Protein Network
6. CLINICAL TRIALS broadly?           --> Template 3: Clinical Landscape
7. VALIDATE a target?                 --> Template 4: Target Validation
8. Multiple categories?               --> Combine sections from relevant templates
```

## Evidence Grading System

Grade **each claim** individually, then compute an overall report confidence. This prevents inflated "high confidence" when some claims are grounded and others are not.

### Evidence Levels

| Level | Range | Name | Criteria |
|-------|-------|------|----------|
| L4 | 0.90-1.00 | Clinical | FDA-approved drug for this indication, OR Phase 2+ trial with published endpoints |
| L3 | 0.70-0.89 | Functional | Multi-database concordance + druggable target + known mechanism of action |
| L2 | 0.50-0.69 | Multi-DB | 2+ independent databases confirm the relationship |
| L1 | 0.30-0.49 | Single-DB | One database source only |

### Modifiers

| Modifier | Adjustment | Condition |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Active trial | +0.10 | Recruiting trial targets this entity/mechanism |
| Mechanism match | +0.10 | Drug mechanism aligns with disease biology (e.g., inhibitor for gain-of-function) |
| Literature support | +0.05 | PubMed or Entrez links confirm relationship |
| High STRING score | +0.05 | STRING interaction score >= 900 |
| Conflicting evidence | -0.10 | Databases disagree on relationship direction or existence |
| Single source | -0.10 | Only one API returned this data point |
| Unverified ID | -0.15 | CURIE not confirmed via LOCATE step |
| Mechanism mismatch | -0.20 | Drug action contradicts disease biology (e.g., agonist for gain-of-function) |

### Grading Procedure

For each claim in the report:

1. **Identify the base level** (L1-L4) from the criteria above
2. **Apply all applicable modifiers** (sum adjustments, clamp to 0.00-1.00)
3. **Record the final score and justification**

For the overall report:
- Compute the **median** of all claim scores (not the mean — resistant to outliers)
- Report the **range** (lowest to highest claim score)
- Flag any claim below L1 (0.30) as "Insufficient Evidence"

### Worked Example: Venetoclax/BCL2

**Claim**: "Venetoclax inhibits BCL2 and is approved for CLL"

1. Base: **L4** (0.90) — FDA-approved drug for this indication
2. Modifiers:
   - Active trials: +0.10 (multiple recruiting CLL trials found via `clinicaltrials_search_trials`)
   - Multi-DB: already captured in L4 base
3. Final: **0.95 (L4 Clinical)**
4. Sources: `[Source: opentargets_get_target(ENSG00000171791)]`, `[Source: clinicaltrials_search_trials("venetoclax CLL")]`

**Claim**: "BCL2 interacts with BAX (STRING score 0.999)"

1. Base: **L2** (0.55) — confirmed by STRING
2. Modifiers:
   - High STRING score: +0.05 (score >= 900)
   - UniProt function text mentions BAX: +0.05 (literature support)
3. Final: **0.65 (L2 Multi-DB)**
4. Sources: `[Source: string_get_interactions(9606.ENSP00000381185)]`, `[Source: uniprot_get_protein(Q07817)]`

---

## Source Attribution Standards

Every factual claim must cite the tool call that produced it. Formats:

| Context | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| MCP tool | `[Source: tool(param)]` | `[Source: hgnc_search_genes("TP53")]` |
| Curl | `[Source: curl endpoint(param)]` | `[Source: curl OpenTargets/graphql(knownDrugs, ENSG00000171791)]` |
| Multi-source | `[Sources: tool1(p1), tool2(p2)]` | `[Sources: hgnc_get_gene(HGNC:11998), uniprot_get_protein(P04637)]` |
| No data | `[No data: tool(param) returned error/0]` | `[No data: chembl_get_compound(CHEMBL3137309) returned 500]` |

---

## Formatting Standards

### Table Conventions
- CURIE column: always present for entities, using full CURIE format (`HGNC:11998`, not `11998`)
- Source column: always the rightmost column
- Evidence Level column: use shorthand `L1`-`L4` in tables, expand in Evidence Assessment section
- Sort drug candidate tables by Phase (descending), then Evidence Level (descending)
- Sort interaction tables by Score (descending)

### First-Mention Rule
On first mention of any entity, include both the human-readable name and CURIE:
```
TP53 (HGNC:11998) encodes the p53 tumor suppressor protein (UniProtKB:P04637).
```
Subsequent mentions may use the name alone.

### Markdown & General
- `## H2` for major sections, `### H3` for subsections, `#### H4` sparingly
- Tables for structured data; prose for narrative synthesis
- No emoji; dates in ISO 8601; scores to 2 decimal places; IC50/Ki in nM
- Abbreviations: define on first use, then abbreviate

---

## Common Report Pitfalls

### Hallucination Injection
**Problem**: Reporting fills in "expected" drug names or trial IDs from training knowledge when Phase 4a or 4b returned sparse results.

**Prevention**: Every row in Drug Candidates and Clinical Trials tables must have a `[Source: tool(param)]` citation. If no source exists, the row must not appear. Write "No drug candidates retrieved" rather than guessing.

### Inflated Confidence
**Problem**: Assigning L3/L4 evidence to claims supported by a single STRING interaction.

**Prevention**: Apply grading procedure strictly. A single-database claim is L1 (0.30-0.49) regardless of how "well known" the relationship seems. Modifiers can raise it, but only based on actual tool output.

### Wrong Template Selection
**Problem**: Using Drug Discovery template for a query about gene networks (cq3, cq5, cq6), producing empty Drug Candidates and Clinical Trials sections.

**Prevention**: Follow the decision tree. If the query mentions "interact", "regulate", "network", or "cascade" without mentioning drugs, use Template 2 (Gene/Protein Network).

### Unverified NCT IDs
**Problem**: Including NCT IDs from Phase 4b search results without Phase 5 verification.

**Prevention**: The "Verified" column in Clinical Trials tables must reflect Phase 5 output. If Phase 5 was not run, mark as "Unverified" (not "Yes").

### Mechanism Mismatch Blindness
**Problem**: For gain-of-function diseases, including agonists in Drug Candidates without flagging the mechanism conflict.

**Prevention**: Cross-reference the disease biology (from Phase 2 enrichment) with each drug's mechanism. Flag agonists for gain-of-function diseases with a -0.20 modifier and a note in Gaps and Limitations.

### Paraphrasing vs Hallucination Confusion
**Problem**: Reviewers flag faithful paraphrasing of UniProt function text as "hallucination" because the report text doesn't match verbatim.

**Acceptable synthesis** (not hallucination):
- UniProt function text paraphrased for readability: "Binds to 3 E-boxes of the E-cadherin/CDH1 gene promoter" → "binds E-boxes in CDH1 promoter"
- Multiple tool outputs synthesized into coherent narrative with all sources cited
- Interpretive claims clearly marked with qualifiers like "[Inferred from...]"

**Unacceptable** (hallucination):
- Entity names, CURIEs, or NCT IDs not present in tool outputs
- FDA approval years (e.g., "FDA-approved 2021"), prevalence statistics (e.g., ">50%"), or trial outcome numbers without sources
- Mechanistic details that extend beyond what tool output states

**Best practice**: Add a synthesis disclaimer to reports that paraphrase extensively:
> "Mechanism descriptions paraphrase UniProt function text and STRING interaction annotations. All synthesis is grounded in cited tool calls; no entities, CURIEs, or quantitative values are introduced from training knowledge."

### Combining Templates Poorly
**Problem**: Including all sections from two templates, creating a bloated report with redundant entity tables.

**Prevention**: Share Resolved Entities and Evidence Assessment across templates. Include unique sections from each. See Multi-Template Combination below.

---

## Multi-Template Combination

When a query spans multiple templates (e.g., cq2 involves both Drug Discovery and Mechanism Elucidation), combine them:

### Shared Sections (include once)
- Summary
- Resolved Entities
- Evidence Assessment
- Gaps and Limitations

### Template-Specific Sections (include from each relevant template)
Take the distinctive sections from each template. Do not duplicate entity tables.

### Worked Example: cq2 (FOP Drug Repurposing)

Query: "What drugs targeting the BMP pathway could be repurposed for FOP?"

**Templates**: Drug Discovery (primary) + Mechanism Elucidation (secondary)

Report structure:
1. Summary (shared)
2. Resolved Entities (shared)
3. Drug Candidates (from Template 1)
4. Mechanism Chain (from Template 6 — traces BMP pathway logic)
5. Mechanism Rationale (from Template 1 — per-drug justification)
6. Clinical Trials (from Template 1)
7. Evidence Assessment (shared — covers all claims)
8. Gaps and Limitations (shared)
