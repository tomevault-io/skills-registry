# dbg - Stateless Debugger & Browser Automation

Debug Node.js processes programmatically. Every `dbg` invocation is stateless: one command in, one response out, exit. A background daemon holds the CDP connection between calls.

## When to Use

- User reports a bug or unexpected behavior in Node.js code
- Need to inspect runtime state, variables, or call stacks
- Investigating why code fails at a specific line
- Analyzing object properties or prototype chains
- Diagnosing slow CDP calls or flaky connections
- Need post-hoc analysis of debugger session history
- **Browser debugging**: console errors, network failures, DOM inspection
- **Browser automation**: navigate, click, type, screenshot
- **Performance testing**: network throttling, device emulation, coverage
- **API mocking**: intercept network requests with custom responses

## Commands

### Start a Session

```sh
dbg open <port|host:port>       # attach to --inspect process
dbg run "node <file>"           # spawn with --inspect-brk, connect
```

### Set Breakpoints

```sh
dbg b <file>:<line>             # set breakpoint
dbg b <file>:<line> if <cond>   # conditional breakpoint
dbg bl                          # list all breakpoints
dbg db <id>                     # delete breakpoint
```

### Control Execution

```sh
dbg c                           # continue (blocks until next pause)
dbg n                           # step over
dbg s                           # step into
dbg o                           # step out
dbg pause                       # pause execution
dbg status                      # check connection/pause state
```

### Inspect State (SQL)

```sh
dbg q "SELECT * FROM frames"
dbg q "SELECT name, type, value FROM vars WHERE frame_id = 0"
dbg q "SELECT * FROM scripts WHERE file LIKE '%<pattern>%'"
dbg q "SELECT name, value FROM props WHERE object_id = '<id>'"
dbg q "SELECT * FROM console"
dbg q "SELECT * FROM exceptions"
```

SQL syntax: `SELECT [cols | *] FROM <table> [WHERE ...] [ORDER BY col [ASC|DESC]] [LIMIT n]`

WHERE operators: `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `LIKE`, `AND`, `OR`, `()`

### Evaluate and View Source

```sh
dbg e "<expression>"            # evaluate, bare value output
dbg src                         # source around current location
dbg src <file> <start> <end>    # specific line range
```

### Diagnostics

```sh
dbg trace                       # recent CDP send/recv with latency
dbg trace 50                    # limit to 50 messages
dbg health                      # probe target, report latency (ms)
dbg reconnect                   # reconnect to last websocket URL
```

### Session Lifecycle

```sh
dbg restart                     # respawn, reconnect, restore breakpoints
dbg close                       # disconnect (kills target if started via run)
```

### Multi-Session (Frontend + Backend)

```sh
dbg run "node server.ts"               # auto-named s0
dbg open 9222 --type page fe           # named "fe", targets browser tab
dbg @be b server.ts:42                 # breakpoint on backend
dbg @fe navigate "http://localhost:3000/login"
dbg @fe q "SELECT * FROM console WHERE type = 'error'"
dbg @be q "SELECT * FROM vars"
```

### Browser Navigation

```sh
dbg navigate <url>                     # go to URL
dbg navigate reload                    # reload current page
dbg navigate back                      # go back in history
dbg navigate forward                   # go forward in history
```

### Browser Interaction

```sh
dbg click "<selector>"                 # click element by CSS selector
dbg type "<selector>" "<text>"         # type into element
dbg select "<selector>" "<value>"      # select dropdown option
dbg screenshot                         # capture PNG (returns base64)
dbg screenshot /tmp/page.png           # save to file
```

### Browser Query Tables

```sh
dbg q "SELECT method, url, status FROM network WHERE status >= 400"
dbg q "SELECT * FROM dom WHERE selector = 'h1'"
dbg q "SELECT * FROM cookies"
dbg q "SELECT key, value FROM storage WHERE type = 'local'"
dbg q "SELECT * FROM performance"
dbg q "SELECT * FROM console WHERE type = 'error'"
```

### Network Mocking

```sh
dbg mock "/api/users" '{"users":[]}'              # intercept with mock response
dbg mock "/api/data" '{}' --status 500             # mock error response
dbg unmock "/api/users"                            # remove specific mock
dbg unmock                                         # clear all mocks
```

### Device Emulation & Throttling

```sh
dbg emulate iphone-14                  # emulate iPhone 14 (390x844)
dbg emulate ipad                       # emulate iPad (810x1080)
dbg emulate pixel-7                    # emulate Pixel 7
dbg emulate reset                      # reset to default

dbg throttle 3g                        # simulate 3G network
dbg throttle slow-3g                   # simulate slow 3G
dbg throttle offline                   # simulate offline
dbg throttle off                       # disable throttling
```

### Code Coverage

```sh
dbg coverage start                     # begin tracking JS + CSS usage
# ... interact with the page ...
dbg coverage stop
dbg q "SELECT url, used_pct FROM coverage ORDER BY used_pct ASC"
```

### Target Management

```sh
dbg targets 9222                       # list all debuggable tabs
dbg open 9222 --type page              # connect to first page target
dbg open 9222 --target <id>            # connect to specific tab
```

## Virtual Tables

### Debugger State

| Table | Description | Required Filter |
|---|---|---|
| `frames` | Call stack | — |
| `scopes` | Scope chains | — |
| `vars` | Variables (frame 0, skips global) | — |
| `this` | `this` binding per frame | — |
| `props` | Object properties | `object_id` |
| `proto` | Prototype chain | `object_id` |
| `breakpoints` | All breakpoints | — |
| `scripts` | Loaded scripts | — |
| `source` | Source lines | `file` or `script_id` |
| `console` | Console messages | — |
| `exceptions` | Thrown exceptions | — |
| `async_frames` | Async stack traces | — |
| `listeners` | Event listeners | `object_id` |

### Event Log

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `events` | Raw event log (daemon, CDP, connections) |
| `cdp` / `cdp_messages` | CDP messages with direction and latency |
| `connections` | Connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect) |
| `timeline` | Unified cross-stream incident timeline (compact by default) |

Event log queries:

```sh
dbg q "SELECT direction, method, latency_ms FROM cdp ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20"
dbg q "SELECT method, latency_ms FROM cdp WHERE latency_ms > 100"
dbg q "SELECT ts, event, session_id FROM connections"
dbg q "SELECT ts, stream, severity, method, entity, summary FROM timeline ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 120"
dbg q "SELECT ts, stream, severity, method, summary FROM timeline WHERE include = 'errors' ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 80"
dbg q "SELECT ts, stream, method, summary FROM timeline WHERE detail = 'full' AND window_ms = 5000 ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 200"
```

Event-backed tables (`events`, `cdp`, `connections`, `timeline`) can be queried even when no debug session is active.

### Browser Tables

| Table | Description | Required Filter |
|---|---|---|
| `network` | HTTP requests/responses | — |
| `network_headers` | Request/response headers | `request_id` |
| `network_body` | Response body content | `request_id` |
| `page_events` | Page lifecycle events | — |
| `dom` | DOM elements by selector | `selector` |
| `styles` | Computed CSS styles | `node_id` |
| `performance` | Performance metrics | — |
| `cookies` | Browser cookies | — |
| `storage` | localStorage/sessionStorage | `type` (local/session) |
| `ws_frames` | WebSocket messages | — |
| `coverage` | JS/CSS code coverage | — |

Browser table queries:

```sh
dbg q "SELECT method, url, status, duration_ms FROM network"
dbg q "SELECT name, value FROM network_headers WHERE request_id = '<id>'"
dbg q "SELECT body FROM network_body WHERE request_id = '<id>'"
dbg q "SELECT node_id, tag, text FROM dom WHERE selector = '.error'"
dbg q "SELECT name, value FROM styles WHERE node_id = 42"
dbg q "SELECT name, value FROM cookies WHERE domain LIKE '%example%'"
dbg q "SELECT key, value FROM storage WHERE type = 'local'"
```

## Output Format

- **TSV** by default (tab-separated, header row)
- **JSON**: append `\j` — `dbg q "SELECT * FROM frames\j"`
- **Bare values** for `dbg e` output
- **Single status line** for flow commands
- **Exit 0** success, **1** error. Parse stdout, check exit code.

## Object Drill-Down Pattern

```sh
# 1. Get object_id from variables
dbg q "SELECT name, object_id FROM vars WHERE name = 'config'"

# 2. Inspect its properties
dbg q "SELECT name, type, value FROM props WHERE object_id = '<id>'"

# 3. Keep drilling into nested objects
dbg q "SELECT name, value FROM props WHERE object_id = '<child_id>'"
```

## Example Workflow

```sh
# Scenario: Function returns unexpected value
dbg run "node app.ts"
dbg b app.ts:42
dbg c
dbg q "SELECT name, type, value FROM vars WHERE frame_id = 0"
dbg e "config.settings"
dbg q "SELECT id, function, file, line FROM frames LIMIT 5"
dbg n
dbg q "SELECT name, value FROM vars WHERE name = 'result'"
dbg close
```

## Browser Debug Loop

```sh
# Scenario: Login page is broken
dbg open 9222 --type page
dbg navigate "http://localhost:3000/login"
dbg q "SELECT type, text FROM console WHERE type = 'error' \j"
dbg q "SELECT method, status, url FROM network WHERE status >= 400 \j"
dbg q "SELECT node_id, text FROM dom WHERE selector = '.error-message' \j"
# ... identify and fix the bug in code ...
dbg navigate reload
dbg q "SELECT * FROM console WHERE type = 'error' \j"
dbg screenshot /tmp/login-fixed.png
# Verify: zero errors, page renders correctly
dbg close
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DBG_SOCK` | `/tmp/dbg.sock` | Unix socket path for daemon communication |
| `DBG_EVENTS_DB` | `/tmp/dbg-events.db` | SQLite event store path (set a persistent path to keep history across runs) |

## Postmortem Timeline Workflow

```sh
# Keep one persistent event DB for repeated runs
export DBG_EVENTS_DB="$HOME/.dbg/history.db"

# Run dbg workflows as usual (open/run/navigate/etc.)
# Later, even with no active session:
dbg q "SELECT ts, stream, severity, method, summary FROM timeline ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 200"
dbg q "SELECT ts, method, error FROM cdp WHERE error != '' ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 100"
```

## Tips

- Every `dbg` call is independent — no session to manage
- Breakpoints persist across `dbg restart`
- Use SQL WHERE clauses to filter large result sets
- `dbg trace` shows CDP latency to diagnose slow operations
- `dbg health` quickly verifies the target is responsive
- `dbg reconnect` recovers from dropped websocket connections
- For browser pages, use `dbg open <port> --type page` to skip Node.js targets
- `dbg targets <port>` lists all available tabs — use `--target <id>` for specific ones
- Network mocks survive page reload (Fetch domain stays enabled)
- Screenshot returns base64 PNG — agents can "see" the page
- Combine DOM queries + screenshots for both structural and visual verification

## Success Criteria

- Root cause identified and documented
- Relevant variables, stack frames, or object state captured
- Fix validated by re-running with breakpoints at the fix point
