# DevSQL Querying Skill

Query Claude Code and Codex CLI history joined with Git commits to analyze productivity patterns.

## When to Use

- User asks "How many Claude sessions did I have this week?"
- User wants to "Find my longest debugging sessions"
- User asks "Which prompts led to the most commits?"
- User wants productivity analytics or session insights
- User asks about correlating Claude/Codex usage with Git history

## Prerequisites

Ensure devsql is installed:
```bash
brew install douglance/tap/devsql
```

## Available Tables

### Claude/Codex Tables
| Table | Columns |
|-------|---------|
| `history` | timestamp, display (prompt text), project, pastedContents |
| `jhistory` | session_id, ts, text, display, timestamp |
| `codex_history` | Alias of `jhistory` |
| `transcripts` | Full conversation data including tool_use, tool_name |
| `todos` | Todo items tracked in sessions |

### Git Tables
| Table | Columns |
|-------|---------|
| `commits` | id, message, summary, author_name, authored_at, short_id |
| `branches` | name, is_head, commit_id |
| `diffs` | Diff content per commit |
| `blame` | Line-by-line attribution |

## Approach

1. Understand what the user wants to analyze
2. Compose a SQL query joining history and Git data as needed
3. Execute with: `devsql "<query>"`
4. Present results with insights

Note: history.timestamp is in milliseconds. Use `datetime(timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch')` to convert.

## Example Queries

```sql
-- Recent prompts
SELECT display as prompt, project
FROM history ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Recent Codex prompts
SELECT datetime(timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch') as time, display
FROM jhistory
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Prompts this week
SELECT COUNT(*) as prompts
FROM history
WHERE datetime(timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch') > date('now', '-7 days');

-- Correlate prompts with commits
SELECT
  date(c.authored_at) as day,
  COUNT(DISTINCT h.timestamp) as prompts,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as commits
FROM commits c
LEFT JOIN history h
  ON date(c.authored_at) = date(datetime(h.timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch'))
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day DESC
LIMIT 14;

-- Which prompts led to commits?
SELECT h.display as prompt, COUNT(c.id) as commits_after
FROM history h
JOIN commits c ON date(datetime(h.timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch')) = date(c.authored_at)
GROUP BY h.display
ORDER BY commits_after DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Tool usage
SELECT tool_name, COUNT(*) as uses
FROM transcripts
WHERE type = 'tool_use'
GROUP BY tool_name
ORDER BY uses DESC;
```

## Output Formats

- Default: formatted table
- CSV: `devsql -f csv "<query>"`
- JSON: `devsql -f json "<query>"`
