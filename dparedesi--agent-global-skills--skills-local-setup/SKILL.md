description: Set up AI tool symlinks in a repository for multi-agent compatibility. Use when the user wants to set up skills for Gemini, Claude, or other AI tools, or when they mention "setup skills", "configure agents", or "link AGENTS.md". Use when this capability is needed.

# Local Skills Setup

Create symlinks so multiple AI tools can use the same skill definitions from `.claude/`.

**Why?** Different AI tools look for config in different places (`.claude/`, `.agent/`, `GEMINI.md`). This skill creates symlinks so you maintain ONE source of truth in `.claude/` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run from any repo root (script is in the global skill location)
~/.claude/skills/skills-local-setup/scripts/skills-local-setup.sh [agent|opencode|gemini|all]
```

---

## Directory Structure

```
.claude/skills/   <- SOURCE (tracked in git)
.agent/skills/    -> symlink to .claude/skills/ (gitignored)
.opencode/skill/  -> symlink to .claude/skills/ (gitignored, singular!)
GEMINI.md         <- directive file (gitignored)
```

## Supported Tools

| Tool | Command | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Agent | `agent` | Creates `.agent/skills/` symlink to `.claude/skills/` (backward compat) |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | Creates `.opencode/skill/` symlink to `.claude/skills/` (singular!) |
| Gemini | `gemini` | Creates `GEMINI.md` with directive to load `AGENTS.md` |
| All | `all` | Sets up all compatibility layers (agent + opencode + gemini) |

> [!NOTE]
> `.claude/skills/` is the source of truth and should be tracked in git. Only the compatibility symlinks/files are gitignored.


---

## Workflow

### 1. Run the Setup Script

```bash
# From repo root — script lives in the global skills directory
~/.claude/skills/skills-local-setup/scripts/skills-local-setup.sh [agent|opencode|gemini|all]
```

The script automatically:
- Validates prerequisites (git repo)
- Creates `.claude/skills/` directory if needed (source of truth, tracked in git)
- Creates compatibility symlinks with relative paths
- Adds symlinks/directive files to `.gitignore`
- Asks for Y/N confirmation before overwriting existing files
- Migrates existing `.agent/settings.json` to `.claude/settings.json` if found

> [!TIP]
> If `AGENTS.md` doesn't exist when setting up Gemini, the script will instruct you to run the `skills-index-updater` skill first to create it.


---

### 2. Verify Setup

```bash
# Check directories and symlinks
ls -la .claude/ .agent/ .opencode/ GEMINI.md 2>/dev/null

# Check .gitignore (should NOT include .claude/)
grep -E "GEMINI|\.agent|\.opencode" .gitignore

# Check git status (symlinks should be ignored)
git status
```

---

## Quality Rules

- **`.claude/` is the source of truth** — Never edit symlinked files directly
- **Symlinks must be in .gitignore** — Keep repo clean, only track actual content
- **Use relative paths** — Symlinks should work regardless of absolute path
- **Confirm before overwriting** — Script shows existing content and asks for Y/N confirmation before removing

### Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Why | Do Instead |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Use absolute paths in symlinks | Breaks when repo moves or on other machines | Use relative paths (`../`) |
| Commit symlinks to git | Creates merge conflicts, breaks for others | Add to `.gitignore` |
| Edit `.agent/` directly | Changes won't persist (it's a symlink) | Edit `.claude/` instead |
| Run outside repo root | Symlinks will be created in wrong location | `cd` to repo root first |

### Validation Checklist

Before considering setup complete:
- [ ] `ls -la` shows symlinks pointing to correct targets
- [ ] `git status` shows no untracked symlinks
- [ ] `.gitignore` contains entries for all symlinks

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| "File exists" error | Target already exists | Check if it's a symlink first, backup if needed |
| Symlink broken after clone | Absolute path used | Recreate with relative path |
| Changes not syncing | Editing symlink, not source | Edit `.claude/` directly |
| Git tracking symlink | Missing .gitignore entry | Add entry to .gitignore |
| AGENTS.md not found | Missing AGENTS.md file | Run `/skills-index-updater` skill first |
