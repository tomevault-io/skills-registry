# Code Analysis Skill

## Overview

Standardized workflow for reading, analyzing, and documenting codebases with attention-driven focus.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Understand a new code module or system
- Analyze architecture and design patterns
- Document technical implementation details
- Prepare for code refactoring or integration
- Create technical documentation for teams
- **Focus on core components** (high-attention code analysis)

---

## Attention-Driven Code Analysis (NEW in v1.2)

Identify core components in code using heuristic rules, optimizing analysis focus.

### Attention Scoring System

```python
# Use the attention_focus.py module
from attention_focus import CodeAttentionScorer

scorer = CodeAttentionScorer()
components = scorer.analyze_code_structure(file_content, file_name)
focus = scorer.get_analysis_focus(components)
```

### Scoring Criteria

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Core Keywords** | +3 | Manager, Controller, Handler, System, Core |
| **Important Keywords** | +2 | Helper, Util, Factory, Provider |
| **Lines of Code** | +2 (>100 lines) / +1 (50-100 lines) | Scale metric |
| **Reference Count** | +2 (>5 refs) / +1 (2-5 refs) | Dependency metric |
| **Complexity** | +1 | Methods>10 or Conditional statements>5 |

### Attention Levels

| Level | Score | Analysis Depth |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **High** | 8-10 | Detailed analysis + Full code + Design principles |
| **Medium** | 5-7 | Focused analysis + Key code snippets |
| **Low** | 0-4 | Brief mention + Function description |

### Workflow with Attention Focus

```
1. Read code file
       ↓
2. Run attention_focus.py analysis
       ↓
3. Get prioritized component list
       ↓
4. Analyze HIGH attention components in detail
5. Analyze MEDIUM attention components briefly
6. Reference LOW attention components as needed
       ↓
7. Generate focused documentation
```

### Benefits

- **Reduce token consumption**: Focus on 20% core code that provides 80% value
- **Faster analysis**: Skip boilerplate and utility code
- **Better documentation**: Highlight architectural decisions and critical paths
- **Estimated improvement**: 20-30% token reduction, 30% faster analysis

## Workflow Template

Every code analysis task MUST follow this 4-step structure:

### 1. Objective

**Definition**: Clear statement of what needs to be understood

**Format**:
```
Objective: [What specifically needs to be understood]
Scope: [Boundaries of the analysis]
Depth: [Overview/Core logic/Detailed implementation]
```

**Examples**:
- Understand how the Tinker serialization library works
- Analyze the architecture design of PlayerSubsystem
- Master the SharedTable data table loading mechanism

### 2. Deliverables

**Definition**: Concrete outputs that will be produced

**Format**:
```
Documentation:
- [Doc name 1] - [Path] - [Content description]
- [Doc name 2] - [Path] - [Content description]

Additional outputs:
- [Code examples/Flowcharts/Architecture diagrams]
```

**Documentation Standards**:
- Place in `repository/projects/[Project]/docs/` or `docs/`
- Use descriptive filenames: `[Topic]-[Type].md`
- Include code snippets and diagrams

### 3. Content

**Definition**: What will be covered in the analysis

**Format**:
```
Analysis content:
1. [Module A] - [Point 1, Point 2, Point 3]
2. [Module B] - [Point 1, Point 2, Point 3]
3. [Inter-module relationships] - [Interaction flow]

Include elements:
□ Core class/interface design
□ Data flow/Control flow
□ Key algorithms/Logic
□ Design patterns
□ Dependencies
```

### 4. Token Estimation

**Definition**: Estimated token consumption for the analysis

**Format**:
```
Token estimation:
- Code reading: ~[X,000] tokens
- Documentation: ~[X,000] tokens
- Total: ~[X,000]-[Y,000] tokens
- Estimated time: [X]-[Y] minutes
```

**Estimation Guidelines**:
| Complexity | Code reading | Documentation | Total | Time |
|--------|----------|----------|------|------|
| Simple (1-2 files) | 3K-5K | 2K-3K | 5K-8K | 15-20min |
| Medium (module-level) | 10K-20K | 5K-10K | 15K-30K | 30-50min |
| Complex (system-level) | 30K-50K | 15K-25K | 45K-75K | 60-90min |

## Important Rules

### Definition Location Confirmation Rule (Critical)

**Rule**: When definition locations are unclear during code analysis, must ask the requester to explicitly specify the location in advance

**Execution Steps**:
1. After receiving an analysis request, first attempt to locate the definition files of key classes/functions
2. If the location cannot be determined through file name or class name search, **immediately stop analysis**
3. Ask the requester: **"Please provide the definition file path for [ClassName]"**
4. After receiving a clear path, continue analysis

**Example**:
```
❌ Incorrect approach:
User: "Analyze NetMessage implementation"
AI: (Blindly search, can't find correct location, analyze based on assumptions)

✅ Correct approach:
User: "Analyze NetMessage implementation"
AI: "Please provide the definition file path for NetMessage,
       Search found possible locations:
       - Server/Network/NetMessage.h
       - Server/Common/NetMessage.h
       Please confirm which file?"
User: "In Server/Network/NetMessage.h"
AI: (Start analysis based on explicit path)
```

---

## Best Practices

### Do's
✅ Define clear scope boundaries, avoid over-analysis
✅ Provide specific file paths and line numbers
✅ Include actual code snippets
✅ Use diagrams to aid understanding (text descriptions)
✅ Estimates should be conservative, leave buffer

### Don'ts
❌ Don't use vague scopes ("analyze the entire project")
❌ Don't omit key deliverable information
❌ Don't underestimate token consumption for complex systems
❌ Don't mix multiple unrelated objectives
❌ Don't blindly guess when definition locations are unclear (**must ask the requester to explicitly specify file paths**)
