# GUTTERS Knowledge Crystallization Protocol

Evolutionary mechanism for GUTTERS. Converts hard-won knowledge into reusable skills and documentation updates.

## Trigger Conditions

Activate when:
1. **User explicitly requests:** "Reflect", "Evolve", "Create skill from this"
2. **Module completed:** Any of the 18+ modules fully implemented and tested
3. **Complex task resolved:** Took 3+ iterations to solve correctly
4. **Pattern emerged:** Same context/explanation needed 3+ times
5. **Integration completed:** External API, calculation engine, or core system integrated

## Decision Matrix: Should This Become a Skill?

### ✅ CREATE SKILL When:
- **Repeatable pattern** across multiple modules (e.g., module implementation)
- **Domain expertise** required (Swiss Ephemeris, Human Design math, NOAA API)
- **Non-obvious gotchas** that caused errors (timezone handling, ephemeris ranges)
- **Complex workflow** with multiple steps (ARQ task setup, event bus integration)
- **External integration** with specific patterns (API rate limiting, caching strategies)

### ❌ DON'T CREATE SKILL When:
- One-time setup task
- Simple CRUD operations (already covered by FastCRUD)
- Generic Python/FastAPI patterns (agent already knows)
- Task won't be repeated
- Context is trivial to reload

## Skill Creation Protocol

### 1. Analyze Session

Review the completed work:
```
What was the task?
What challenges were encountered?
What specific knowledge was required?
What would have made this faster/easier?
What gotchas should future developers know?
```

### 2. Determine Skill Type

**Module Pattern Skill:**
- Example: `calculation-module-implementation`
- When: Creating calculation modules (astrology, numerology, etc.)
- Content: Specific calculation patterns, data structures, validation

**Integration Skill:**
- Example: `noaa-api-integration`, `swiss-ephemeris-usage`
- When: Integrating external services/libraries
- Content: API patterns, error handling, caching, rate limits

**Architecture Skill:**
- Example: `event-bus-patterns`, `active-memory-usage`
- When: Using GUTTERS core systems
- Content: How modules interact with event bus, memory cache

**Domain Knowledge Skill:**
- Example: `human-design-calculation`, `astrological-aspects`
- When: Complex domain calculations implemented
- Content: Mathematical formulas, data structures, edge cases

### 3. Draft Skill Structure
```markdown
---
name: [descriptive-name]
description: [When to use - be specific about triggers]. Use when [exact scenario].
---

# [Skill Title]

[2-3 sentence overview - what problem this solves]

## When to Use

- [Specific trigger 1]
- [Specific trigger 2]

## Pattern/Implementation

[Core implementation pattern - CODE EXAMPLES, not explanations]

## Gotchas

- [Specific error/issue and solution]
- [Non-obvious behavior to know]

## Critical Checklist

- [ ] [Verification step 1]
- [ ] [Verification step 2]

## References

See `references/[detailed-doc].md` for [additional context]
```

**Max length:** 200 lines in SKILL.md, move details to `references/`

### 4. Quality Gates

Before finalizing skill, verify:
- [ ] **Concise:** Main file under 200 lines
- [ ] **Actionable:** Code examples, not prose explanations
- [ ] **Specific:** Clear "when to use" triggers
- [ ] **Necessary:** Will actually improve future velocity
- [ ] **Tested:** Patterns are proven to work
- [ ] **GUTTERS-aligned:** Matches no-mocks, production-ready philosophy

### 5. File Structure
```
skills/[skill-name]/
├── SKILL.md                    # Main file (under 200 lines)
├── references/                 # Optional
│   ├── detailed-example.md     # Complete working code
│   └── edge-cases.md           # Known issues, solutions
└── scripts/                    # Optional
    └── helper.py               # Executable utilities
```

## AGENTS.md Update Protocol

### When to Update AGENTS.md

Update when:
- **Project structure changed** (new core system, major refactor)
- **Philosophy evolved** (new standards, changed patterns)
- **Common mistake identified** (needs to be in "NEVER" section)
- **New critical command** (essential development workflow)

### Update Format

**Present as diff, don't overwrite:**
```markdown
## Proposed AGENTS.md Update

**Section:** [Commands / Critical Rules / Module Development]

**Add to "[Section Name]":**
```
[New content block]
```

**Rationale:** [Why this addition improves development]

**Location:** After line [X] in current AGENTS.md

User must apply manually to prevent accidental overwrites.

## GUTTERS-Specific Skill Categories

### Priority 1: Module Types
- `calculation-module-implementation` ✅ (exists)
- `tracking-module-implementation` (for solar/lunar/transit modules)
- `intelligence-module-implementation` (for observer/hypothesis/synthesis)

### Priority 2: External Integrations
- `swiss-ephemeris-integration` (ephemeris calculations, edge cases)
- `noaa-api-integration` (space weather data fetching)
- `openrouter-integration` (AI model calls, prompt management)

### Priority 3: Core Systems
- `event-bus-usage` (publishing, subscribing, event patterns)
- `active-memory-patterns` (cache management, invalidation)
- `arq-background-jobs` (task scheduling, cron patterns)

### Priority 4: Domain Knowledge
- `astrological-calculations` (aspects, houses, transits)
- `human-design-math` (bodygraph calculation, gate mapping)
- `birth-time-refinement` (hypothesis generation, confidence scoring)

### Priority 5: Chat and Refinement
- `chat-architecture-patterns` (Master vs Branch logic, singleton UI presence)
- `cognitive-interface-standards` (how modules report "thinking" to the user)
- `genesis-refinement-dialogue` (patterns for gathering uncertain data via chat)
- `session-memory-synthesis` (linking chats to long-term user profiles)

## Execution Steps

1. **Analyze** completed work against decision matrix
2. **Determine** if skill creation justified
3. **Draft** skill following format (concise, actionable)
4. **Verify** against quality gates
5. **Present** to user with clear rationale
6. **Save** to `skills/[name]/SKILL.md`

## Output Format
```
📊 SESSION ANALYSIS
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Proposed Skill:
- Name: [skill-name]
- Type: [Module / Integration / Architecture / Domain]
- Priority: [1-4]
- Saves: [Estimated time saved on future similar tasks]

📝 DRAFT SKILL CONTENT
─────────────────────────────────────────────

💾 NEXT STEPS
─────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Review draft above
2. Save to `skills/[name]/SKILL.md`
3. Reload window for agent to access
4. Test on next similar task
```

## Critical Reminders

- **Not every task needs a skill** - only repeatable, complex, or error-prone patterns
- **Conciseness matters** - if it's over 200 lines, use references/
- **Test-driven** - only create skills for proven patterns
- **Living document** - skills can be updated as we learn more

**This skill improves itself by learning when to create skills.**
