# /start-issue

Load a GitHub Issue, create a branch, and develop an implementation plan.

## Usage

```
/start-issue <issue-number> [--force] [--current-branch]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `issue-number` | integer | Yes | GitHub Issue number |
| `--force` | flag | No | Skip plan mode and all interactive confirmations (including TDD user approval). **Full autonomous mode**: Do not output any questions or confirmations as text. Execute all steps (including Issue reporting) without pausing. |
| `--current-branch` | flag | No | Skip branch creation, use the current branch |

## Instructions

When the user invokes `/start-issue <number>`, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Load Issue

```bash
gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,labels,state
```

Verify the issue exists and is open. If not open, warn the user.

### Step 2: Determine Branch Type

**If `--current-branch` is specified, skip this step entirely.**

Based on the issue labels and content, determine the appropriate branch prefix:

| Label | Prefix |
|-------|--------|
| `enhancement`, `feature` | `feat/` |
| `bug` | `fix/` |
| `refactoring`, `refactor` | `refactor/` |
| `documentation`, `docs` | `docs/` |
| `test` | `test/` |
| `chore` | `chore/` |

If no matching label, check title/body for keywords. Default to `feat/`.

### Step 3: Create Branch

**If `--current-branch` is specified, skip branch creation.** Instead, display the current branch name:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

If the result is empty (detached HEAD), display an error and abort.

**Otherwise (default behavior):**

Generate branch name: `<prefix>/<issue-number>-<normalized-title>`

Normalization rules:
- Lowercase
- Remove special characters
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Limit to 40 characters

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

If branch exists, checkout instead of create.

### Step 4: Plan Implementation

Unless `--force` is specified, enter plan mode before proceeding. With `--force`, execute all phases directly without entering plan mode and without any interactive confirmations.

**CRITICAL (`--force` mode):** You are running in a non-interactive `claude -p` pipeline. There is no user to respond. You MUST NOT output any questions, confirmations, or prompts as text (e.g., "〜しますか？", "〜してよろしいですか？"). Execute every step autonomously and proceed to the next step immediately. This applies to ALL steps including Step 5 (Report to Issue).

Regardless of `--force`, execute the following phases to create an implementation plan.

First, read the workflow configuration:

```bash
cat .claude/workflow-config.json
```

Check `documentation.ddd.enabled` to determine if DDD workflow is active.

#### Phase 1: Analyze Requirements

1. Extract requirements from issue body
2. Identify acceptance criteria
3. If `--force` is not specified, clarify any ambiguous requirements with user. With `--force`, make reasonable assumptions and proceed.

#### Phase 2: Identify Impact Scope

1. Identify affected code files
2. Identify affected documentation using **doc-updater skill** detection patterns:

| Change Type | Documentation Impact |
|-------------|---------------------|
| New CLI option | README, `--help` output |
| API endpoint added/changed | API documentation |
| Configuration option added | Config guide |
| Environment variable added | Setup guide |
| Feature added | Feature documentation |

Target documents are defined in `documentation.paths` from workflow config.

#### Phase 3: Document-Driven Development (DDD)

**Skip this phase if `documentation.ddd.enabled` is false.**

Before implementation, update documentation as specification using **doc-updater skill**:

1. **Draft documentation changes**
   - Write usage examples for new features
   - Document expected behavior
   - Define configuration options
   - If `documentation.ddd.retcon_writing` is true, write documentation as if the feature already exists
     - Purpose: Produces clearer, more confident documentation
     - Example: "Run `--format json`" instead of "will allow users to..."

2. **Update target documents** (from `documentation.paths`):
   - `README.md` - Usage and examples
   - `docs/` - Detailed documentation
   - CLI `--help` text (in code comments)
   - `CHANGELOG.md` (from `documentation.changelog`) if applicable

3. **Review documentation with user** (skip if `--force` — treat documentation as approved and proceed)
   - Documentation becomes the "contract" for implementation

#### Phase 4: Design Test Cases (TDD Approach)

Based on the documented specification, design test cases using **tdd-workflow skill**:

1. Identify test scenarios from documentation
2. Define expected inputs and outputs
3. Consider edge cases documented in Phase 3

**If `--force` is specified:**

Skip all TDD user confirmation steps and execute the Red-Green-Refactor cycle autonomously without user approval:

- Do **not** ask "Do you want me to follow TDD workflow?" — assume yes
- Do **not** wait for user approval of test cases — proceed directly to Red confirmation
- Do **not** output any question or confirmation text (e.g., "〜しますか？") — there is no user to respond
- Write tests → confirm failure (Red) → implement (Green) → refactor — all automatically
- Still report test results at each phase, but do not pause for confirmation

**If `--force` is not specified (default):**

Follow the standard TDD workflow with user confirmation:

- Ask the user if they want to follow TDD workflow
- Present test cases and get user approval before proceeding
- Wait for user confirmation at each TDD phase transition

#### Phase 5: Create Implementation Plan

1. List tasks in dependency order
2. Identify potential risks and mitigations
3. Summarize in table format

### Step 5: Report to Issue

**With `--force`: Execute this step immediately without asking for confirmation. Do not output questions like "Issueに報告しますか？" — just do it.**

Post the plan as a comment on the issue using issue-reporter skill:

```markdown
## Implementation Plan

**Task**: [Issue title]

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

### Expected Challenges

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Issue not found | Display error with `gh issue view` suggestion |
| Issue is closed | Warn user and ask for confirmation. With `--force`, warn in output but proceed without confirmation. |
| gh not authenticated | Display `gh auth login` instruction |
| Uncommitted changes | Ask user to commit or stash changes |
| Branch creation failed | Display error details |
| Detached HEAD with `--current-branch` | Display error: not on a branch, checkout a branch first |
| `workflow-config.json` not found | Display error: "Run `/init` to create configuration." |
| `documentation` section missing | Treat as DDD disabled, inform user |
| `documentation.paths` missing or empty | Display warning about no documentation targets |
| doc-updater/tdd-workflow skill not found | Display error with skill installation guidance |
