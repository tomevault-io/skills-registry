# release-check

Validates release readiness before creating a release.

## Purpose

This skill validates that all artifacts are complete and consistent for release:

- **Spec kit artifacts**: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md exist and are complete
- **Documentation**: README.md, CHANGELOG.md have required sections
- **Versioning**: Version numbers are consistent across package.json and CHANGELOG
- **API docs**: API documentation matches contract specifications

## Output

The skill outputs a **ReleaseChecklist** with:

- Overall readiness status (Ready/Not Ready)
- Individual check items with pass/fail/skip status
- Version consistency information
- Specific issues to address before release

## Usage

This is a manual skill - run it before creating a release:

```bash
npx skills run release-check
```

Or via AI agent:
```
User: Check if we're ready for release
```

|------|--------|---------|
