# Code Review

Review code for correctness, unintended impact, and adherence to project patterns. Start by determining the review scope.

## 1. Determine Review Type

Ask the user which type of review they want:

- **Pre-PR** — Current branch vs. base branch → `git diff <base>...HEAD`
- **Pre-commit** — Staged changes only → `git diff --cached`
- **Module** — All code in a specific module or directory → full file reads, no diff
- **Project** — Overall project structure and patterns → full codebase exploration

If the user doesn't specify, ask before proceeding — the review process differs significantly by type.

## Pre-PR Review

Review all changes in the current branch against the destination branch.

### Setup

**Determine base branch** (if not specified): check common ancestors with `main`, `master`, `develop`, or `release/*`; verify the commit count is reasonable.

**Build change map:**

- Get the full diff against the base branch
- Exclude generated files (lockfiles, build artifacts, snapshots) unless manually edited
- Group changes by intent: new feature, bug fix, refactor, configuration, tests
- For each modified export or shared component — search all usages to understand blast radius

**Gather context:**

- Read commit messages and PR description if available

### Review Focus

Apply the full review process: the "What to Look For", "What NOT to Flag", and "Calibrate Severity" sections below.

### Output

- **Summary** — What changed, intent, overall assessment (approve / request changes / needs discussion)
- **Findings** — Issues with severity, file location, recommendation, and impact
- **Improvements** (optional) — Non-blocking suggestions

---

## Pre-commit Review

Review staged changes before committing.

### Setup

- Get staged diff: `git diff --cached`
- If nothing is staged, inform the user and stop
- Group changes by file and intent

### Review Focus

Prioritize:

- **Correctness** — Does the logic do what's intended? Obvious bugs, typos, missing null checks
- **Completeness** — Are related changes staged together? Missing type updates, forgotten test updates
- **Accidental inclusions** — Debug logs, commented-out code, unrelated formatting changes, sensitive data
- **Consistency** — Do changes follow existing patterns in the touched files?

Apply the full review process: the "What to Look For", "What NOT to Flag", and "Calibrate Severity" sections below.

### Output

**Review findings** (if any) — Same format as Pre-PR.

**Commit message** — Generate a commit message for the staged changes:

- First line: imperative mood, max 72 chars, describe _what_ and _why_ (not _how_)
- Body (if needed): additional context for non-obvious changes, separated by blank line
- Follow the project's existing commit message conventions (check `git log --oneline -10` for style)

Example:

```
fix: prevent stale closure in usePolling callback

The interval callback captured the initial state value. Use a ref
to always read the latest value inside the interval.
```

## Module Review

Review all code in a specific module, directory, or feature area — not just recent changes.

### Setup

- Ask the user which module or directory to review (if not specified)
- Read all source files in the module
- Identify the module's public API (exports, interfaces, props)
- Map dependencies: what does this module depend on, and what depends on it?

### Review Focus

- **Structure** — Is the module well-organized? Clear responsibilities? Appropriate file boundaries?
- **Public API** — Is the interface clean, consistent, and minimal? Are types precise?
- **Internal quality** — Dead code, unnecessary complexity, duplicated logic within the module
- **Patterns** — Does the module follow the same patterns as similar modules in the project?
- **Test coverage** — Are critical paths tested? Are tests testing behavior or implementation details?
- **Dependencies** — Are there circular dependencies, over-coupling, or unnecessary imports?

Skip line-by-line nitpicks. Focus on structural findings that affect maintainability.

### Output

- **Module overview** — Purpose, public API surface, dependency map
- **Findings** — Structural issues with severity and recommendations
- **Health assessment** — Overall module quality: well-structured / needs attention / needs refactoring

---

## Project Review

High-level review of overall project structure, patterns, and health. No diff — this is a holistic assessment.

### Setup

- Read project configuration (package.json, tsconfig, etc.)
- Explore the directory structure
- Sample 3-5 representative modules to assess pattern consistency
- Check test setup and coverage patterns
- Review dependency list for outdated, heavy, or redundant packages

### Review Focus

- **Architecture** — Is the project organized logically? Are responsibilities clear between layers/directories?
- **Pattern consistency** — Do similar features follow similar patterns, or has the codebase diverged over time?
- **Dependency health** — Outdated packages, heavy bundles, redundant libraries doing the same thing
- **Test strategy** — Is there a coherent testing approach? Unit vs integration vs e2e balance?
- **Developer experience** — Are there sharp edges? Missing types, confusing naming, undocumented conventions?
- **Scaling concerns** — What will hurt as the project grows? Tight coupling, monolithic files, missing abstractions?

### Output

- **Project overview** — Tech stack, structure, key patterns
- **Strengths** — What's working well
- **Concerns** — Issues ranked by impact, with actionable recommendations
- **Recommendations** — Prioritized list of improvements (quick wins vs. larger efforts)

## What to Look For

Applies to all review types. Consult relevant reference checklists (`references/typescript.md`, `references/react.md`, `references/css.md`, `references/testing.md`, etc.) based on the file types touched.

Focus on what reference checklists don't cover:

### Impact on Existing Code

The highest-value part of a review. For every change to shared code:

- **Search all usage sites** — Don't just review the diff; grep for every modified export and verify callers still work
- **Check behavioral changes** — A renamed prop, a changed default, a new required field can break distant consumers silently
- **Trace data flow changes** — If data shape changes, follow it through the pipeline to the UI
- **Verify API contracts** — Breaking changes to interfaces or public APIs must be caught

### Problem Verification

- Understand the problem before evaluating the solution — does the fix address the root cause, or just the symptom?
- For bug fixes: is there now a test that would have caught this regression?
- Search for the same pattern elsewhere in the codebase — a fix in one place often applies to siblings

### Abstraction Justification

- **Premature extraction** — Under ~20 lines rarely needs its own module. Inline until a second or third consumer proves the abstraction.
- **Wrapper types** — Custom type aliases that re-wrap a library's types without adding information obscure the original API.
- **One-use helpers** — Functions extracted for "reusability" but called from exactly one place fragment logic without reducing complexity.

### Interface Design

- Prefer `children`, render props, or slot patterns over configuration props (`buttonProps`, `mode` flags). Boolean/mode props often signal a component doing too many things.
- Can the interface be smaller? Each prop is a contract that must be maintained.

### Dead Code

- Identify dead code explicitly: unused exports, unreachable branches, commented-out blocks
- List what you found — don't silently skip or silently remove
- Recommend removal only after confirming it's truly unused (grep for all references)

### Multi-Model Review

When reviewing AI-generated code (or your own output from an earlier step):

- Apply the same standards as human-written code — AI output is not exempt from review
- Watch for AI-specific patterns: overly verbose error handling, unnecessary abstractions, hallucinated APIs, inconsistent naming

### Assumptions Audit

For non-trivial decisions, ask: **what does this assume that could change?**

- Assumes a specific API response shape, field presence, or ordering
- Assumes a component is rendered exactly once, or in a specific context
- Assumes a domain constant is stable — if it's not, it should be a config value, not an inline literal
- If an assumption is load-bearing, it should be enforced by types or validated at runtime

### State Persistence

- **URL search params** — For state that should be shareable, bookmarkable, or deep-linkable
- **Ephemeral state** — For transient UI concerns (modals, hover, animation). No persistence needed.
- **localStorage** — Only for user preferences that should survive sessions and don't need to be shareable.
- **Avoid multi-store sync** — The same conceptual state should live in one place.

### Design Spec Alignment

If the change is UI-facing, verify against design specs (Figma, mockups). Flag discrepancies between implementation and design intent.

### Cross-Project Consistency

If sibling or related projects exist:

- **Naming divergence** — Different names for equivalent concepts across projects. Align when the concept is the same.
- **Reinvented utilities** — Existing shared utilities that could be reused instead of reimplemented.
- **Pattern drift** — Established conventions in older projects that should carry forward.

## What NOT to Flag

- **Style preferences** that don't violate project conventions — if it's valid and consistent, leave it
- **Equally valid alternatives** — "I would have done it differently" is not a review finding
- **Issues in unchanged code** — unless the diff directly affects them
- **Nitpicks on code being deleted or moved** — don't review dead code
- **Hypothetical future problems** — flag only if the current change creates a concrete risk

## Calibrate Severity

Severity reflects **user and production impact**, not code aesthetics:

- 🔴 **Critical** — Breaks functionality, causes data loss, security vulnerability, accessibility barrier that blocks users. Must fix before merge.
- 🟡 **Major** — Causes problems over time: missing tests for complex logic, performance regressions, incorrect types that hide bugs, shared code changes without verifying consumers. Should fix before merge.
- 🟢 **Minor** — Could be better: simplification opportunities, minor duplication, non-blocking naming suggestions. Fix if convenient.

## Prioritize Review Effort

Not all changes deserve equal attention:

- **High** — New logic, state changes, data flow (where bugs live)
- **High** — Changes to shared code: components, utils, types (widest blast radius)
- **High** — Security-relevant code: auth, input handling, API (highest stakes)
- **Medium** — New files and new abstractions (design decisions that compound)
- **Medium** — Test changes (verify they test real behavior)
- **Low** — Renames, formatting, import reordering (unlikely to introduce bugs)
- **Low** — Config and boilerplate changes (skim for obvious errors)

For large diffs (20+ files): review types and interfaces first to understand the contract, then group remaining files by feature/concern rather than reviewing file-by-file.

## Don't Rationalize

- "The code looks fine to me" — Trace all usage sites for changed shared code. "Looks fine" isn't a review.
- "I would have done it differently" — Preference isn't a finding. Different isn't wrong.
- "It's just a small change" — Small changes to shared code have the widest blast radius. Check consumers.
- "The tests pass" — Passing tests prove the tests pass, not that the code is correct. Tests have gaps.
- "I'll flag it next time" — Note it now. Use severity levels to indicate urgency.

## Verification

- [ ] All usage sites of modified shared code checked
- [ ] Severity ratings reflect user/production impact, not aesthetics
- [ ] No findings on unchanged code or style preferences
- [ ] Bug fixes have regression tests (or the gap is flagged)
- [ ] Dead code identified and listed explicitly
- [ ] Assumptions in non-trivial decisions identified
