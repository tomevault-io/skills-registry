description: This skill should be used when the user asks to 'get to 100% coverage', 'improve test coverage', 'cover uncovered code', 'fix coverage gaps', or mentions uncovered lines or coverage percentage. Provides strategies for achieving complete test coverage through better code design. Use when this capability is needed.

# Getting to 100% Test Coverage

## Philosophy

**Coverage isn't about the number - it's about code quality.** Code that's hard to test is usually hard to understand, maintain, and reason about. Pursuing 100% coverage forces you to write better code.

### The Galahad Principle

Why 100% specifically? Because 100% provides disproportionate value compared to 95%:

**Simplicity:** A binary state (covered vs. not) provides clear, unambiguous signals. When everything is at 100%, any deviation immediately demands attention. "We have 100% coverage" is a statement you can trust. "We have 95% coverage" always raises the question: which 5% and why?

**Trust:** Complete coverage eliminates ambiguity. If coverage is always 100%, then any uncovered line is a bug - either in your code or your process. Absence of coverage becomes evidence of a problem, not just noise to filter out. You stop needing to ask "is this uncovered code intentional?" - the answer is always no.

Like Sir Galahad's pure heart granting him the strength of ten, 100% coverage gives you something that 95% coverage cannot: certainty.

**Don't suppress coverage. Fix the code.**

## Workflow

1. Find uncovered code with coverage reports
2. For each gap, categorize why it's uncovered (see references/patterns.md)
3. Apply the appropriate fix pattern
4. Verify 100% coverage

## Categorizing Coverage Gaps

For each uncovered section, ask: **Why isn't this covered?**

- **Category A: Genuinely Unreachable Code** - Make it an explicit error with `unreachable!()`
- **Category B: Defensive Error Swallowing** - Let errors propagate, or be explicit about which errors to catch
- **Category C: Hard-to-Test Dependencies** - Extract and inject dependencies
- **Category D: Error Handling Branches** - Separate IO from logic, test the logic

See `references/patterns.md` for detailed code examples of each category.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Generate HTML report
cargo llvm-cov --html

# Fail if under 100%
cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines 100

# Show uncovered lines in terminal
cargo llvm-cov --show-missing-lines
```

## Key Principles

1. **Coverage tools show symptoms** - Low coverage reveals design problems
2. **100% is achievable** - If it's not, the code needs refactoring
3. **Tests are documentation** - Each test explains a use case
4. **Untestable code is a smell** - It's telling you something about the design
5. **Mock at boundaries** - Don't mock internal implementation details

## Writing Effective Tests

### Use Data That Looks Like Data
Test data should be visually distinctive and obviously different from code, variable names, and system defaults. This makes debugging vastly easier because when a value appears in a log or error message, you can immediately tell where it came from.

- **Don't:** `name = "user"`, `path = "file"`, `id = 1`, `count = 0`
- **Do:** `name = "alice-test-user"`, `path = "test-data/waveforms/meow.wav"`, `id = 42`, `count = 7`

Generic values like `1` and `0` could be defaults, sentinel values, or array indices. Distinctive values are immediately recognizable as test data.

### Write Test Names That Explain Intent
Test names and docstrings should explain WHY a behavior matters, not just WHAT is being tested. Strip boilerplate phrases like "Test that...", "should...", "correctly", and "properly" — these add no information.

- **Don't:** `test_parse_input_correctly` — "Test that input is parsed correctly"
- **Do:** `test_parse_input_extracts_config_without_validation` — explains the purpose and what would go wrong if it failed

### Be Explicit About What Tests Cover
When reporting on tests, be clear about what they verify. "All tests pass" is less useful than "tests verify X and Y, but do not exercise the path where Z happens." This gives reviewers the information they need to assess whether additional testing is warranted.

### Tests Are Checks, Not Proof
A green test suite does not mean nothing broke. Tests only verify what they were written to verify. Remain skeptical even when all tests pass — think about whether a change could affect behavior not covered by any test. Supplement automated checks with active thinking about edge cases, surprising inputs, and interactions.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Don't suppress with `#[coverage(off)]` annotations
- Don't add meaningless tests just to hit lines
- Don't mock everything - at some point you're testing mocks, not code
