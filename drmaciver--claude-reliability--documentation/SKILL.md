# Writing How-To Guides

## When to Write a How-To

Create a how-to when you:
- Do something more than once
- Figure out a non-obvious procedure
- Want to standardize a workflow
- Document a fix that might recur

## Structure of a Good How-To

### 1. Clear Title
Start with "How to..." and be specific:
- Good: "How to deploy to production"
- Bad: "Deployment"

### 2. Context
Brief explanation of when to use this guide:
```markdown
Use this guide when you need to release a new version to production.
Prerequisites: All tests passing, version bumped.
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Instructions
Numbered steps, each doing one thing:
```markdown
1. Ensure all tests pass: `just test`
2. Bump the version in Cargo.toml
3. Create a git tag: `git tag v1.2.3`
4. Push with tags: `git push --tags`
5. Wait for CI to publish
```

### 4. Troubleshooting (Optional)
Common problems and solutions:
```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### CI fails on publish
- Check if version already exists on registry
- Verify credentials are not expired
```

## Creating How-Tos

```bash
claude-reliability howto create \
  -t "How to add a new API endpoint" \
  -i "... markdown content ..."
```

## Linking to Tasks

When a task needs to follow a procedure:
```bash
claude-reliability work link-howto <work-item-id> --howto-id <howto-id>
```

Now when viewing the task, the guidance is visible.

## Searching How-Tos

Find relevant guides:
```bash
claude-reliability howto search "deploy"
claude-reliability howto list  # See all
```

## Maintaining How-Tos

### Update When Procedures Change
```bash
claude-reliability howto update <id> -i "... new content ..."
```

### Delete Obsolete Guides
```bash
claude-reliability howto delete <id>
```

### Review Periodically
- Are the steps still accurate?
- Has the tooling changed?
- Can any steps be simplified?

## Example: Complete How-To

# How to Add a New Database Migration

Use this guide when adding a new table or modifying the schema.

## Prerequisites
- Database access configured
- Migration tool installed

## Steps

1. Create a new migration file:
   ```
   sqlx migrate add <migration_name>
   ```

2. Edit the generated file in `migrations/` with your SQL

3. Test locally:
   ```
   sqlx migrate run
   ```

4. Verify the changes work:
   ```
   cargo test
   ```

5. Commit the migration file

## Troubleshooting

### "migration failed: relation already exists"
The migration may have partially run. Check the database state and either:
- Drop the partial changes manually, or
- Adjust the migration to be idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS)

### "cannot find migration"
Ensure the migration file is in the correct directory and has the `.sql` extension.
```

## Documenting Decisions (ADRs)

When making architecture or design decisions, record the rationale alongside the decision. Without recorded rationale, future developers face a dilemma: blindly accept past decisions or blindly reverse them.

**What to capture:**
- What forces were in tension?
- What was decided?
- What alternatives were considered and why rejected?
- What are the consequences?

**Format:** Keep it lightweight — a short paragraph in a commit message, a comment block at the top of a module, or a dedicated decision record. The key is that the rationale is captured somewhere durable and discoverable.

ADRs are particularly valuable for decisions that seem arbitrary or surprising. If you chose a less obvious approach for a good reason, that reason must be written down or it will be lost.

## The GHC Notes Pattern

When a non-obvious decision or constraint affects multiple locations in the codebase, write the detailed explanation once in a canonical location with a clear heading, and reference it elsewhere with a short comment.

**Example:**
```rust
// In the canonical location:
// Note [Why we validate before serializing]
// We must validate all fields before serializing because the serializer
// assumes well-formed input and will produce corrupt output otherwise.
// This was discovered in issue #42 when partial records caused silent
// data corruption.

// In other files that relate to this:
// See Note [Why we validate before serializing] in validator.rs
```

This prevents comment duplication and drift while keeping code well-documented. Write the explanation once, reference it everywhere.

## Tips

1. **Be specific** - Vague instructions lead to mistakes
2. **Include commands** - Copy-pasteable commands save time
3. **Note prerequisites** - What must be true before starting?
4. **Add troubleshooting** - Document problems you encountered
5. **Keep updated** - Outdated how-tos are worse than none
6. **Record the "why"** - Decision rationale is as important as the decision itself
