# XLSX Skill (Anthropic Official Source)

Source: `https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/xlsx`

Use this skill for spreadsheet-centric workflows.

## Typical Triggers

- "update this Excel file"
- "create a spreadsheet model"
- "clean this CSV/TSV and output xlsx"
- "add formulas/charts/formatting to workbook"

## Working Rules

1. Use formulas in the sheet instead of hardcoded computed values.
2. Preserve existing workbook conventions when editing templates.
3. Validate output for formula errors (`#REF!`, `#DIV/0!`, `#VALUE!`, etc.).
4. Keep transformation provenance for publication-quality reproducibility.

## Quick Commands

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel("input.xlsx")
df.to_excel("output.xlsx", index=False)
```
