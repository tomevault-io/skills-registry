# Parallel Literature Search

**All sources at once.** This skill searches PubMed, web, and your RAG knowledge base in parallel, then synthesizes the findings into a single coherent summary with citations.

---

## WHAT IT DOES

| Source | What It Searches | Output |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **PubMed** | Academic literature, trials, reviews | PMIDs, abstracts, citations |
| **Perplexity** | Web, recent news, guidelines | Summaries with sources |
| **RAG (AstraDB)** | Your curated knowledge base | Guideline excerpts, textbook refs |

---

## THE DIFFERENCE

| Approach | Sources | Time | Depth |
|----------|---------|------|-------|
| Sequential search | One at a time | 5+ min | Deeper but slow |
| **Parallel search** | All at once | 30-60 sec | Fast overview |
| Manual search | You do it | 20+ min | Variable |

---

## TRIGGERS

Use this skill when you say:
- "Search for evidence on [topic]"
- "What does the literature say about [topic]?"
- "Find research on [topic]"
- "Quick literature review on [topic]"
- "Evidence for [clinical question]"

---

## USAGE

### In Claude Code (Recommended)

```
"Parallel search: SGLT2 inhibitors in HFpEF"

"Find all evidence on GLP-1 and cardiovascular outcomes"

"What does literature say about statin discontinuation?"
```

### CLI Mode

```bash
# Basic search
python scripts/parallel_search.py --query "SGLT2 inhibitors heart failure"

# Specify sources
python scripts/parallel_search.py --query "GLP-1 cardiovascular" --sources pubmed,perplexity

# Save output
python scripts/parallel_search.py --query "CAC scoring" --output ~/research/
```

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

```markdown
# Literature Search: SGLT2 Inhibitors in HFpEF

**Query:** SGLT2 inhibitors heart failure preserved ejection fraction
**Searched:** 2025-01-01 09:30:45
**Sources:** PubMed, Perplexity, RAG

---

## SYNTHESIS

SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated significant benefit in HFpEF based on
EMPEROR-Preserved and DELIVER trials. Key findings:

1. **EMPEROR-Preserved (PMID: 34449189)**: Empagliflozin reduced composite
   endpoint of CV death/HHF by 21% (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.90)

2. **DELIVER (PMID: 36027570)**: Dapagliflozin showed 18% reduction in
   worsening HF/CV death (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73-0.92)

3. Current guidelines (ACC/AHA 2022) recommend SGLT2i as Class 2a for HFpEF.

| DELIVER | High | Large RCT, confirmatory |
| Meta-analyses | High | Consistent findings |
| Real-world | Moderate | Observational limitations |

## GAPS & CONSIDERATIONS

- Limited data in specific HFpEF phenotypes
- Long-term safety data still accumulating
- Indian-specific data limited (consider local studies)

## CLINICAL QUESTION OPTIMIZATION

The skill recognizes PICO format:

| Component | Example | How It's Used |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **P**atient | "elderly patients with HFpEF" | Filters PubMed |
| **I**ntervention | "SGLT2 inhibitors" | Primary search term |
| **C**omparison | "vs placebo" | Narrows to RCTs |
| **O**utcome | "mortality" | Focuses results |

---

## SAMPLE QUERIES

```
# Basic clinical question
"SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure"

# PICO format
"In elderly patients with HFpEF, do SGLT2 inhibitors reduce mortality compared to placebo?"

# Specific trial
"What are the key findings from EMPEROR-Preserved?"

# Guideline-focused
"Current ACC/AHA recommendations for SGLT2i in heart failure"

# Comparative
"SGLT2i vs GLP-1 for cardiovascular outcomes in diabetes"
```

---

## NOTES

- **Speed**: Parallel search takes 30-60 seconds vs 5+ minutes sequential
- **Depth**: Good for overview, not exhaustive systematic review
- **Citations**: Always includes PMIDs for verification
- **Updates**: Perplexity provides most recent web data

---

*This skill gives you evidence from multiple sources in under a minute - perfect for content preparation and quick clinical questions.*
