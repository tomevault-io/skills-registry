# Viral Content Predictor for Medical Education

This skill analyzes healthcare/medical education content ideas and predicts their viral potential using multi-factor analysis, trend research, and YouTube audience insights.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Content Idea Analysis**: Extract and score content ideas from uploaded documents
2. **Viral Potential Prediction**: Estimate views, engagement, and AVD based on multiple factors
3. **Trend Research**: Identify hot topics and emerging trends in medical education
4. **Audience Intelligence**: Analyze YouTube comments to understand knowledge gaps and concerns
5. **Content Optimization**: Provide subtopics, myths to address, and structural recommendations

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Content Extraction & Initial Scoring

When the user provides PDF/DOCX files with content ideas:

1. **Extract all content ideas** from the document
2. **Initial categorization** by topic, complexity, and format
3. **Preliminary viral score** (0-100) based on:
   - Topic relevance and timeliness
   - Emotional appeal (fear, hope, relief, empowerment)
   - Searchability and SEO potential
   - Educational value vs entertainment balance
   - Novelty factor

### Phase 2: Deep Research & Validation

For top-scoring ideas (score >70) or user-selected ideas:

1. **Search current trends**: Use web_search to find:
   - Recent high-performing videos on the topic
   - News articles and medical publications
   - Reddit/forum discussions
   - Trending searches related to the topic

2. **Competitive analysis**:
   - Identify top-performing videos in the niche
   - Analyze view counts, engagement ratios, and video length
   - Note common patterns and differentiators

3. **Knowledge gap identification**:
   - What questions are people asking?
   - What misconceptions exist?
   - What information is missing from existing content?

### Phase 3: Predictive Analytics

For each analyzed idea, calculate:

1. **Predicted View Range**: Based on:
   - Search volume data (estimated from trends)
   - Similar video performance benchmarks
   - Topic saturation level
   - Seasonal/temporal relevance
   - Channel authority factor (assumed moderate for interventional cardiology niche)

2. **Engagement Prediction**:
   - Estimated likes, shares, comments
   - Expected like-to-view ratio
   - Share potential score

3. **AVD (Average View Duration) Optimization Score**:
   - Topic retention potential (inherent interest)
   - Complexity level (optimal: moderate complexity for patient education)
   - Hook strength assessment
   - Pacing recommendations

### Phase 4: Content Blueprint

For prioritized ideas, provide:

1. **Video Structure Recommendation**:
   - Optimal video length
   - Hook suggestions (first 10 seconds)
   - Chapter breakdown with timestamps
   - Pacing guidance for high retention

2. **Subtopics to Include** (in priority order):
   - Core information (must-have)
   - High-interest tangents (AVD boosters)
   - Myth-busting segments (engagement drivers)
   - Practical takeaways (satisfaction & shareability)

3. **Psychological Triggers to Address**:
   - Common fears related to the topic
   - Misconceptions to debunk
   - Hope/empowerment angles
   - Trust-building elements

4. **SEO & Discoverability**:
   - Title suggestions (tested patterns)
   - Thumbnail concepts
   - Keyword recommendations
   - Description template

## Scoring Methodology

### Viral Potential Score (0-100)

**Topic Factors (40 points)**:
- Search demand: 15 pts (estimated from trend data)
- Emotional resonance: 10 pts (fear, hope, curiosity)
- Timeliness: 10 pts (recent news, seasonal relevance)
- Novelty: 5 pts (unique angle or new information)

**Engagement Factors (30 points)**:
- Shareability: 10 pts (will people send to family/friends?)
- Comment-worthiness: 10 pts (controversial or discussion-inducing?)
- Practical value: 10 pts (actionable information)

**Retention Factors (30 points)**:
- Hook potential: 10 pts (compelling opening)
- Information density: 10 pts (value per minute)
- Narrative flow: 10 pts (story or logical progression)

### View Prediction Formula

```
Estimated Views = Base_Audience × Topic_Multiplier × Quality_Factor × Trend_Factor

Where:
- Base_Audience: 5,000-15,000 (typical for established medical education channel)
- Topic_Multiplier: 0.5-10.0 (based on search volume and competition)
- Quality_Factor: 0.8-1.5 (based on production quality, assumed 1.0)
- Trend_Factor: 0.5-3.0 (based on current trending status)

Range Output: 
- Minimum (conservative): Lower quartile estimate
- Expected (median): Most likely scenario
- Maximum (optimistic): Upper quartile with viral potential
```

## Research Tools & Techniques

### Web Search Strategies

When researching topics, use these search patterns:

1. **Trend identification**:
   - "[topic] latest research 2024"
   - "most common questions about [topic]"
   - "[topic] myths debunked"

2. **Audience analysis**:
   - "reddit [topic] patient experience"
   - "[topic] what to expect forum"
   - "[topic] success stories"

3. **Competition analysis**:
   - "[topic] youtube popular"
   - "how to explain [topic] to patients"
   - "[topic] doctor explains"

### YouTube Comment Analysis Strategy

When the user provides a topic or video URL:

1. Search for top 5-10 videos on the topic
2. Analyze comment patterns for:
   - Most frequently asked questions
   - Common confusions or misconceptions
   - Emotional reactions (fear, gratitude, skepticism)
   - Requests for specific information
   - Demographic clues (age, situation)

3. Categorize insights into:
   - **Knowledge gaps**: What people don't understand
   - **Fears**: What worries them
   - **Desires**: What they hope to learn
   - **Trust signals**: What builds credibility

## Best Practices

### For Medical Education Content

1. **Balance authority with accessibility**: Use simple language but demonstrate expertise
2. **Lead with empathy**: Acknowledge fears and concerns first
3. **Provide hope**: Always include positive outcomes or management strategies
4. **Be specific**: Concrete examples outperform abstractions
5. **Use visual analogies**: Help patients visualize complex concepts
6. **Address "why"**: Explain mechanisms, not just recommendations
7. **Anticipate objections**: Address common pushback or skepticism
8. **Include patient stories**: Anonymized cases increase retention
9. **End with empowerment**: Clear next steps or takeaways

### AVD Optimization Tactics

1. **Pattern interrupt every 60-90 seconds**: Change visual, topic, or energy
2. **Open loops**: Tease information that comes later
3. **Progress indicators**: "Three things you need to know..."
4. **Highlight surprising facts**: "Most people don't know..."
5. **Use conversational pacing**: Speak as if to one person
6. **Strategic repetition**: Reinforce key points without being boring
7. **Maintain momentum**: Cut dead air and unnecessary transitions

## Reference Files

- **references/medical-content-patterns.md**: Analysis of high-performing medical YouTube content patterns
- **references/cardiology-keywords.md**: SEO-optimized keywords for cardiology topics
- **references/avd-tactics.md**: Advanced retention strategies specific to educational content

## When to Use Multiple Research Iterations

For content ideas scoring 85+:
1. Run initial analysis
2. Conduct deep competitive research
3. Search for recent medical publications
4. Analyze comment sections of top 5 competing videos
5. Check Reddit/forums for patient perspectives
6. Synthesize into comprehensive blueprint

This ensures the highest-potential ideas get the deepest analysis.
