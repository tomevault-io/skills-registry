# JavaScript Testing Patterns

Comprehensive guide for implementing robust testing strategies in JavaScript/TypeScript applications using modern testing frameworks and best practices.

## When to Use This Skill

- Setting up test infrastructure for new projects
- Writing unit tests for functions and classes
- Creating integration tests for APIs and services
- Testing React, Vue, or other frontend components
- Implementing test-driven development (TDD)
- Setting up continuous testing in CI/CD pipelines

## Testing Frameworks

### Vitest - Fast, Vite-Native Testing

```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: "node",
    coverage: {
      provider: "v8",
      reporter: ["text", "json", "html"],
      exclude: ["**/*.d.ts", "**/*.config.ts", "**/dist/**"],
    },
    setupFiles: ["./src/test/setup.ts"],
  },
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Follow AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
2. **One assertion per test**: Or logically related assertions
3. **Descriptive test names**: Should describe what is being tested
4. **Mock external dependencies**: Keep tests isolated
5. **Test edge cases**: Not just happy paths
6. **Avoid implementation details**: Test behavior, not implementation
7. **Use test factories**: For consistent test data
8. **Maintain test coverage**: Aim for 80%+ coverage
9. **Test error handling**: Not just success cases
10. **Use semantic queries**: Prefer `getByRole` over `data-testid`
