# ECR Management Service

Create, track, and coordinate Engineering Change Requests (ECRs) for medical device design history files.

## Overview

The ECR Manager service:
1. Creates new ECR packages with proper numbering
2. Tracks ECR status through approval workflow
3. Links changes to affected documents
4. Coordinates document reviews
5. Triggers re-assessment when changes affect compliance

## Usage

```
/dtge-ecr-manager create <project-path>               # Create new ECR
/dtge-ecr-manager status <project-path>               # Show ECR status summary
/dtge-ecr-manager status <project-path> ECR149        # Show specific ECR details
/dtge-ecr-manager review <project-path> ECR149        # Schedule/coordinate review
/dtge-ecr-manager close <project-path> ECR149         # Close completed ECR
```

## ECR Workflow

```
CREATE → DRAFT → UNDER_REVIEW → APPROVED → IMPLEMENTED → VERIFIED → CLOSED
                     ↓
                 REJECTED → (revise) → UNDER_REVIEW
```

## Create ECR

### Step 1: Get Next ECR Number

Query existing ECRs in project to determine next number:
```bash
# Check 10-Design_Changes/ folders for existing ECRs
# Pattern: ECR{number}_{description}/
```

### Step 2: Gather Change Information (LLM-guided)

Collect through conversation:
- **Change Description:** What is being changed?
- **Reason for Change:** Why is this change needed?
- **Affected Documents:** Which documents need revision?
- **Regulatory Impact:** Does this affect:
  - Intended use?
  - Safety/risk profile?
  - Labeling claims?
  - Predicate comparison?
- **Risk Assessment:** Does change require new/updated risk analysis?
- **Verification/Validation:** What testing is needed?

### Step 3: Create ECR Package

**Directory structure:**
```
<project>/10-Design_Changes/ECR{number}_{short_description}/
├── ECR{number}_Form.md           # ECR form
├── ECR{number}_Impact_Assessment.md
├── affected_documents/           # Documents to be revised
├── verification/                 # Verification records
└── approval_records/             # Review and approval evidence
```

### Step 4: Generate ECR Form

```markdown
# Engineering Change Request

## ECR Information

```

## ECR Impact Assessment

When an ECR is created, automatically assess impact on:

### DCA Re-evaluation
- Does the change affect device classification?
- Does the change add new applicable standards?
- Does the change affect existing DCA coverage?

### Gap Analysis Trigger
- If change affects risk profile → re-run gap analysis for Risk Management domain
- If change affects user interface → re-run gap analysis for Usability domain
- If change affects software → re-run gap analysis for Software domain

### Traceability Update
- Identify affected trace chains
- Flag documents needing revision
- Update `registry.json` with ECR association

## Track ECR Status

## Integration

### With Gap Analysis
ECR creation can trigger gap re-assessment:
- Change to risk profile → Risk Management domain
- Change to UI → Usability domain
- Change to software → Software domain

### With Document Creation
ECR provides context for `/dtge-create-dhf`:
- ECR number for document naming
- Change scope for content generation
- Affected requirements for traceability

### With DCA
Significant changes may require DCA update:
- New standards become applicable
- Device classification changes
- New regulatory requirements identified

## Project Integration

### Higi Project ECR Tracking

ECR packages are stored in:
- `original_510k/10-Design_Changes/` (ECR ≤135)
- `prior_changes/10-Design_Changes/` (ECR 136-148)
- `special_510k/10-Design_Changes/` (ECR 149+)

### Regulatory Tasks Integration

ECRs feed into `regulatory_tasks.json` for project tracking:
```json
{
  "ecr_id": "ECR149",
  "status": "under_review",
  "tasks": [
    {"id": "T-149-01", "description": "Update DHFD-28", "status": "complete"},
    {"id": "T-149-02", "description": "System testing", "status": "in_progress"}
  ],
  "blockers": [],
  "target_date": "2026-03-01"
}
```
