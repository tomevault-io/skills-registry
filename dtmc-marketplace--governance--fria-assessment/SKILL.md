description: Conduct Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments (FRIA) for high-risk AI systems as required by EU AI Act Article 27. Use when (1) deployers of high-risk AI systems (Annex III) need to assess fundamental rights impacts before first use, (2) public bodies or private entities providing public services are deploying AI systems, (3) credit scoring or insurance risk assessment AI systems are being deployed (Annex III 5b, 5c), (4) evaluating impact on natural persons' fundamental rights (dignity, liberty, privacy, data protection, non-discrimination, children's rights, etc.), or (5) creating EU AI Act Article 27 compliance documentation with market surveillance notification. Use when this capability is needed.

# Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA)

## Overview

A Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) is a mandatory evaluation required by EU AI Act Article 27 for certain deployers of high-risk AI systems. It identifies risks to fundamental rights of individuals or groups and establishes mitigation measures.

## Legal Basis: Article 27

## Risk Assessment Methodology

### Likelihood x Severity Matrix

```text

                    Low    Medium    High
              ┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
         High │ MEDIUM  │  HIGH   │CRITICAL │
              ├─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
LIKELIHOOD Med│  LOW    │ MEDIUM  │  HIGH   │
              ├─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
         Low  │MINIMAL  │  LOW    │ MEDIUM  │
              └─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

### Likelihood Assessment Criteria

| Level | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **High** | Very likely to occur | History of similar issues, inherent system design risk, vulnerable population |
| **Medium** | Possible under certain conditions | Conditional triggers, partial safeguards |
| **Low** | Unlikely but possible | Strong safeguards, low exposure |

### Severity Assessment Criteria

| Level | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **High** | Significant harm | Major discrimination, denial of essential services, irreversible impact |
| **Medium** | Moderate harm | Partial rights restriction, recoverable harm, limited scope |
| **Low** | Minor harm | Inconvenience, easily remedied, small impact |

## DPIA Integration (Article 27(4))

The FRIA may complement an existing Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under:
- GDPR Article 35
- LED Article 27 (Directive 2016/680)

If a DPIA has been conducted, the FRIA should:
1. Reference the DPIA
2. Build on DPIA findings
3. Focus on fundamental rights beyond data protection
4. Address AI-specific risks

## Integration Points

**Inputs from**:
- `ai-risk-classification` skill → Annex III category determination
- `data-classification` skill → Data processing context
- Provider's instructions for use → System capabilities and limitations
- DPIA → Data protection risk assessment

**Outputs to**:
- Market surveillance authority → Notification
- Internal governance → Compliance documentation
- `hitl-design` skill → Human oversight requirements
- Incident response → Risk monitoring
