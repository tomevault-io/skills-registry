# Codebase Context

## Purpose

Analyze the existing codebase and produce a comprehensive context briefing covering architecture, data model, patterns, and constraints. This output becomes shared context for ALL council agents — it is the foundation every other skill builds on.

## Inputs

- Project root directory ($WORKSPACE)
- Any existing CLAUDE.md or project documentation
- Package manifests (package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Configuration files (tsconfig.json, next.config.js, .env.example, etc.)

## Process

### Step 1: Read Project Configuration

Read CLAUDE.md, package.json (or equivalent), tsconfig, and any config files at the project root. Extract framework, language version, key dependencies, and build tooling.

### Step 2: Map Directory Structure

List top-level directories and identify their purposes. Recurse one level into key directories (src/, app/, lib/, components/, etc.) to understand the organizational pattern.

### Step 3: Identify Core Architectural Patterns

Determine the routing approach (file-based, config-based), data fetching strategy (SSR, SSG, CSR, RSC), state management solution, and component patterns (atomic, feature-based, etc.).

### Step 4: Map the Existing Data Model

Read database schema files, migration history, or ORM models. List tables, their relationships, key entities, and access control policies (e.g., RLS policies for Supabase).

### Step 5: Catalog Key Conventions

Identify naming conventions (camelCase vs snake_case, file naming), file structure patterns, import conventions (barrel exports, path aliases), and error handling patterns used throughout the codebase.

### Step 6: Note Infrastructure Constraints

Document hosting platform, database type and version, auth provider, CDN configuration, edge function usage, environment variable patterns, and deployment pipeline.

### Step 7: Identify Integration Points

Catalog external APIs, webhooks, third-party services, and any inter-service communication patterns. Note authentication methods for each integration.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Context Briefing

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: [name + version]
- **Language**: [name + version]
- **Database**: [type + provider]
- **Auth**: [provider + method]
- **Hosting**: [platform]
- **Key Dependencies**: [list with versions]

## Directory Structure
```
[tree output with annotations]
```

## Architectural Patterns
- **Routing**: [approach]
- **Data Fetching**: [strategy]
- **State Management**: [solution]
- **Component Pattern**: [style]

## Data Model
| Entity | Key Fields | Relationships |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| ...    | ...       | ...           |

[ASCII relationship diagram if complex]

## Conventions
1. [Convention with example]
2. [Convention with example]
3. [Convention with example]

## Infrastructure Constraints
- [Constraint and implication]
- [Constraint and implication]

## Integration Points
| Service | Purpose | Auth Method |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| ...     | ...     | ...         |

## Warnings / Tech Debt
- [Known issue or constraint that affects design decisions]
```

## Quality Checks

- [ ] No hardcoded file paths — all paths are relative to $WORKSPACE
- [ ] All 7 process areas are covered in the output
- [ ] At least 3 conventions are identified and documented with examples
- [ ] Tech stack versions are specified (not just names)
- [ ] Data model section includes relationships, not just entity lists
- [ ] Integration points include auth methods
- [ ] Warnings section flags any constraints that would affect new feature design
