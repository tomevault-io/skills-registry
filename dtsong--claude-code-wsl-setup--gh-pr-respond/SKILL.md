# /gh-pr-respond - Respond to Review Comments

View and respond to review comments on a pull request.

## Usage

```bash
/gh-pr-respond              # Show comments on current PR
/gh-pr-respond 123          # Show comments on PR #123
/gh-pr-respond --unresolved # Show only unresolved threads
/gh-pr-respond --mine       # Show comments requiring my response
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch PR Comments

```bash
# Get PR for current branch
PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q '.number' 2>/dev/null)

# Get review comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$PR_NUM/comments

# Get reviews with comments
gh pr view $PR_NUM --json reviews,reviewThreads
```

Using GitHub MCP:

```javascript
mcp__github__get_pull_request_comments(owner, repo, pr_number)
mcp__github__get_pull_request_reviews(owner, repo, pr_number)
```

### Step 2: Categorize Comments

Organize by:
- Resolved vs unresolved
- By file
- By reviewer
- By severity (blocking vs suggestion)

### Step 3: Help Respond

For each comment:
- Show context (code snippet)
- Explain the feedback
- Suggest response or code fix

[2] src/hooks/useTheme.ts:12 - @reviewer2 (6 hours ago)
    Status: Unresolved | Type: Bug

    Code:
    │ 11  useEffect(() => {
    │ 12    const listener = window.matchMedia('...').addEventListener(...);
    │ 13  }, []);

    Comment:
    "This event listener is never cleaned up, which will
    cause a memory leak. Add a cleanup function."

    Suggested fix:
    ```typescript
    useEffect(() => {
      const mql = window.matchMedia('...');
      const handler = (e) => { ... };
      mql.addEventListener('change', handler);
      return () => mql.removeEventListener('change', handler);
    }, []);
    ```
