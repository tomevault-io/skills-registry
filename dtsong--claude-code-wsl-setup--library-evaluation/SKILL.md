# Library Evaluation

## Purpose

Produce a structured, weighted comparison of candidate libraries to make dependency decisions based on evidence rather than familiarity or hype.

## Inputs

- The need or problem the library should solve
- Any known candidates (or let the process discover them)
- Project constraints (bundle size budget, license requirements, framework compatibility)
- Current tech stack and existing dependencies

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Candidate Libraries

- Search npm, GitHub, and community recommendations for the problem space
- Include the most popular option, the most recently trending option, and at least one lightweight alternative
- Note any candidates already in use in the codebase's dependency tree

### Step 2: Evaluate Popularity Metrics

For each candidate:
- npm weekly downloads (absolute number and trend direction)
- GitHub stars and recent star velocity
- Community size (Discord, Stack Overflow tags, GitHub Discussions activity)
- Notable adopters (large companies or well-known projects using it)

### Step 3: Assess Maintenance Health

For each candidate:
- **Commit frequency:** Active development or maintenance-only?
- **Issue response time:** Median time to first response on new issues
- **Release cadence:** Regular releases or long gaps?
- **Bus factor:** Single maintainer or team? Corporate backing?
- **Breaking change history:** How are major versions handled?

### Step 4: Measure Bundle Impact

For each candidate:
- Gzipped bundle size (via bundlephobia or similar)
- Tree-shaking support (ESM exports, side-effect-free)
- Dependency count (transitive dependencies and their health)
- Runtime performance characteristics if applicable

### Step 5: Review API Quality and Developer Experience

For each candidate:
- TypeScript support (built-in types, DefinitelyTyped, quality of types)
- Documentation quality (getting started guide, API reference, examples)
- API ergonomics (intuitive naming, sensible defaults, composability)
- Migration path from current solution if applicable

### Step 6: Check License Compatibility

For each candidate:
- License type (MIT, Apache 2.0, ISC, GPL, etc.)
- Compatibility with project's license
- Transitive dependency license concerns
- Any commercial use restrictions

### Step 7: Produce Weighted Comparison Score

- Assign weights based on project priorities (e.g., bundle size matters more for client-side)
- Score each criterion 1-5
- Calculate weighted total
- Flag any deal-breakers that override the score

## Output Format

### Library Comparison Matrix

| Criterion | Weight | Candidate A | Candidate B | Candidate C |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Weekly downloads | ... | .../5 | .../5 | .../5 |
| Maintenance health | ... | .../5 | .../5 | .../5 |
| Bundle size | ... | .../5 | .../5 | .../5 |
| TypeScript support | ... | .../5 | .../5 | .../5 |
| API quality | ... | .../5 | .../5 | .../5 |
| License | ... | .../5 | .../5 | .../5 |
| **Weighted Total** | | **...** | **...** | **...** |

### Recommendation

**Recommended:** [Library Name]
**Rationale:** [2-3 sentence justification referencing the top differentiating factors]
**Risks:** [Known risks or caveats with the recommendation]
**Migration notes:** [If replacing an existing dependency, key migration steps]

## Quality Checks

- [ ] At least 3 candidate libraries evaluated
- [ ] npm download trends checked (not just absolute numbers)
- [ ] Maintenance health assessed (commit frequency, issue response, bus factor)
- [ ] Bundle size measured with gzipped numbers
- [ ] TypeScript support quality verified
- [ ] License compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Weighted scores reflect project-specific priorities
- [ ] Deal-breakers explicitly called out
