description: Use when designing documentation architecture for a project or team. Covers audience mapping, Diataxis framework classification, onboarding path design, format and location decisions, documentation testing, and maintenance scheduling. Do not use for recording individual architecture decisions (use adr-template) or creating versioned changelogs (use changelog-design).

# Documentation Plan

## Purpose

Design a comprehensive documentation architecture that maps content types to audiences, defines onboarding paths, and establishes maintenance schedules. Produces a documentation strategy that scales with the team and codebase.

## Scope Constraints

Reads existing documentation, project structure, and team context to produce a documentation strategy. Does not create or modify actual documentation files or deploy documentation infrastructure.

## Inputs

- Project type and scope (library, application, platform, API)
- Target audiences (developers, API consumers, end users, operators)
- Current documentation state (what exists, what's missing, what's stale)
- Team size and growth expectations

## Input Sanitization

No user-provided values are used in commands or file paths. All inputs are treated as read-only analysis targets.

## Procedure

### Progress Checklist
- [ ] Step 1: Identify documentation audiences
- [ ] Step 2: Map documentation types needed
- [ ] Step 3: Define documentation structure
- [ ] Step 4: Specify format and location
- [ ] Step 5: Plan developer onboarding flow
- [ ] Step 6: Design documentation testing
- [ ] Step 7: Define maintenance schedule

### Step 1: Identify Documentation Audiences

Map each audience and their needs:
- **New developers**: Getting started, local setup, architecture overview, "where is X?" answers
- **Experienced team members**: API reference, design decisions, runbooks, troubleshooting guides
- **API consumers**: Authentication, endpoint reference, rate limits, SDKs, changelog
- **End users**: Feature guides, FAQs, tutorials, release notes
- **Operators/SREs**: Deployment procedures, monitoring runbooks, incident response, infrastructure docs
- For each audience, define their entry point, primary tasks, and information needs

### Step 2: Map Documentation Types Needed

Catalog required documentation:
- **Getting started**: Quick start, prerequisites, installation, "hello world" in under 5 minutes
- **API reference**: Endpoint docs, type definitions, error codes, authentication
- **Architecture overview**: System diagram, component responsibilities, data flow, key decisions
- **Runbooks**: Operational procedures, incident response, common troubleshooting steps
- **User guides**: Feature walkthroughs, best practices, common patterns
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step learning paths, progressive complexity, working examples

### Step 3: Define Documentation Structure

Apply the Diataxis framework:
- **Tutorials**: Learning-oriented — guided lessons that teach through doing
- **How-to guides**: Task-oriented — steps to achieve a specific goal
- **Explanation**: Understanding-oriented — background, context, design rationale
- **Reference**: Information-oriented — accurate, complete technical descriptions
- Map each existing and planned document to its Diataxis category, identify gaps

### Step 4: Specify Format and Location

Define where each doc type lives:
- **In-repo markdown**: Architecture docs, ADRs, contributing guides (versioned with code)
- **Generated API docs**: Auto-generated from code/types (OpenAPI, TypeDoc, Storybook)
- **Wiki/knowledge base**: Runbooks, onboarding guides, team processes (frequently updated)
- **Inline code docs**: JSDoc/TSDoc for public APIs, README per module/package
- Establish naming conventions, directory structure, and linking strategy

### Step 5: Plan Developer Onboarding Flow

Design progressive onboarding:
- **Day 1**: Environment setup, run the app locally, make a trivial change, deploy to dev
- **Week 1**: Architecture overview, codebase tour, key abstractions, first real task
- **Month 1**: Deep-dive into owned area, understand cross-cutting concerns, contribute to docs
- Include checkpoints, mentorship touchpoints, and feedback collection
- Create an onboarding checklist that tracks progress

### Step 6: Design Documentation Testing

Ensure documentation stays accurate:
- **Link checking**: Automated broken link detection in CI
- **Code sample validation**: Test that code examples compile/run (extract and execute in CI)
- **Freshness reviews**: Flag docs not updated in N months, assign review owners
- **Screenshot/diagram validation**: Process for updating visual assets when UI changes
- **Feedback mechanism**: Easy way for readers to report issues ("Was this helpful?" + issue link)

### Step 7: Define Maintenance Schedule

Establish ongoing documentation health:
- **Review cadence**: Quarterly full review, monthly spot-checks on high-traffic docs
- **Ownership per section**: Every doc section has an owner responsible for accuracy
- **Staleness detection**: Automated alerts when docs haven't been updated alongside related code changes
- **Deprecation process**: How to mark docs as outdated, redirect to replacements, eventually remove
- **Contribution guidelines**: How to write docs, style guide, review process for doc PRs

> **Compaction resilience**: If context was lost during a long session, re-read the Inputs section to reconstruct what system is being analyzed, check the Progress Checklist for completed steps, then resume from the earliest incomplete step.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Documentation Plan: [Project Name]

## Documentation Map

| Doc Type | Audience | Format | Location | Owner | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Getting Started | New devs | Markdown | /docs/getting-started.md | [team] | [exists/needed/stale] |
| API Reference | API consumers | Generated | /docs/api/ | [team] | ... |
| Architecture | All devs | Markdown + diagrams | /docs/architecture/ | [team] | ... |
| Runbooks | Operators | Wiki | [wiki URL] | [team] | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Diataxis Mapping

| Category | Documents | Gap Analysis |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Tutorials | [list] | [what's missing] |
| How-to Guides | [list] | [what's missing] |
| Explanation | [list] | [what's missing] |
| Reference | [list] | [what's missing] |

## Onboarding Path

```
Day 1: [Setup] → [Run app] → [Trivial change] → [Deploy to dev]
  ↓
Week 1: [Architecture tour] → [Codebase walkthrough] → [First task]
  ↓
Month 1: [Deep-dive] → [Cross-cutting concerns] → [Doc contribution]
```

## Maintenance Schedule

| Cadence | Activity | Owner | Automation |
|---------|----------|-------|------------|
| Per PR | Link checking | CI | Automated |
| Monthly | High-traffic doc review | Rotating | Reminder |
| Quarterly | Full doc audit | Tech lead | Staleness report |

## Ownership Matrix

| Section | Primary Owner | Backup | Last Review |
|---------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Getting Started | [name] | [name] | [date] |
| API Reference | [name] | [name] | [date] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

## Handoff

- Hand off to adr-template if the documentation plan reveals architectural decisions that need formal recording.
- Hand off to changelog-design if the documentation audit uncovers version upgrade communication gaps or missing migration guides.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] All target audiences are identified with their specific documentation needs
- [ ] Documentation types are mapped to the Diataxis framework with gap analysis
- [ ] Format and location are specified for each doc type (in-repo, generated, wiki)
- [ ] Developer onboarding path covers day 1, week 1, and month 1 milestones
- [ ] Documentation testing includes link checking and code sample validation
- [ ] Maintenance schedule defines review cadence and staleness detection
- [ ] Every documentation section has an assigned owner
- [ ] Contribution guidelines exist for writing and reviewing documentation
