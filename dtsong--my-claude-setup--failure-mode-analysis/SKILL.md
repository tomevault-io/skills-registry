description: Use when systematically identifying failure scenarios for proposed features and infrastructure changes. Covers component enumeration, failure mode discovery, cascade analysis, mitigation design, monitoring signals, and rollback planning. Do not use for security threat modeling (use threat-model) or input boundary testing (use edge-case-enumeration).

# Failure Mode Analysis

## Purpose
Systematically identify failure scenarios for proposed features and design mitigations that maintain system resilience.

## Scope Constraints

Analyzes system architecture, dependency graphs, and infrastructure configurations for failure scenarios. Does not modify infrastructure, execute chaos tests, or access production systems. Limited to design-time failure identification and mitigation planning.

## Inputs
- Feature or infrastructure change being analyzed
- System architecture (services, databases, APIs, third-party dependencies)
- Current reliability requirements (SLA/SLO targets)
- Existing monitoring and alerting setup

## Input Sanitization

No user-provided values are used in commands or file paths. All inputs are treated as read-only analysis targets.

## Procedure

### Step 1: List System Components
Enumerate all components involved: services, databases, APIs, third-party dependencies, caches, queues, CDNs, DNS, and any shared infrastructure.

### Step 2: Enumerate Failure Modes Per Component
For each component, systematically consider:

- **Network failures**: Timeout, DNS resolution failure, TLS handshake failure, connection reset, packet loss
- **Data failures**: Corruption, inconsistency between stores, migration errors, schema drift, encoding issues
- **Resource exhaustion**: Memory leak, CPU saturation, connection pool exhaustion, disk full, file descriptor limits
- **Dependency failures**: Third-party API down, rate limited, schema change, authentication revoked, region outage
- **State failures**: Race conditions, stale cache serving wrong data, split-brain in distributed systems, phantom reads

### Step 3: Assess Cascade Potential
Map the failure tree: if component X fails, what else breaks? Identify single points of failure and shared dependencies. Determine blast radius for each failure mode.

### Step 4: Design Mitigations
For each failure mode, define:

- **Graceful degradation**: What functionality survives? What's the user experience during failure?
- **Retry strategy**: Exponential backoff with jitter, circuit breaker thresholds, max retry limits
- **Fallback behavior**: Cached data, default values, error states, read-only mode
- **Recovery procedure**: Automatic vs manual recovery, estimated time to recovery, data reconciliation steps

### Step 5: Define Monitoring Signals
For each failure mode, specify the metric, log pattern, or alert that detects it. Include detection latency — how quickly will you know?

### Step 6: Plan Rollback Strategy
Define rollback approach: feature flags for instant disable, database rollback scripts, deployment rollback procedure, data cleanup if needed.

### Progress Checklist
- [ ] Step 1: System components listed
- [ ] Step 2: Failure modes enumerated per component
- [ ] Step 3: Cascade potential assessed
- [ ] Step 4: Mitigations designed
- [ ] Step 5: Monitoring signals defined
- [ ] Step 6: Rollback strategy planned

> **Compaction resilience**: If context was lost during a long session, re-read the Inputs section to reconstruct what system is being analyzed, check the Progress Checklist for completed steps, then resume from the earliest incomplete step.

## Output Format

### Failure Mode Table

| Component | Failure Mode | Severity | Cascade Risk | Mitigation | Monitoring Signal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Component] | [What fails] | Critical/High/Medium/Low | [What else breaks] | [Specific mitigation] | [Metric/alert] |

### Cascade Diagram
```
[Component A fails]
  ├── [Component B] — degraded (uses cached data)
  ├── [Component C] — down (hard dependency)
  │   └── [Component D] — down (depends on C)
  └── [Component E] — unaffected (independent)
```

### Rollback Checklist
- [ ] Feature flag to disable: [flag name]
- [ ] Database rollback: [migration name / script]
- [ ] Deployment rollback: [procedure]
- [ ] Data cleanup: [steps if needed]
- [ ] Communication: [who to notify]

## Handoff

- Hand off to threat-model if security vulnerabilities are discovered during failure analysis.
- Hand off to operator/observability-design if monitoring gaps require comprehensive observability planning.

## Quality Checks
- [ ] Every external dependency has failure analysis
- [ ] Cascade paths are fully mapped with blast radius
- [ ] Mitigations don't introduce new failure modes
- [ ] Monitoring covers detection of each identified failure
- [ ] Rollback strategy is defined and tested
- [ ] Recovery time estimates are documented
