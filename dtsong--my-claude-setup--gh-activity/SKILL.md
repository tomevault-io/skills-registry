## Scope Constraints

- Read-only operations — queries commits, PRs, issues, and releases to summarize recent repository activity.
- Does not create, modify, or close any GitHub resources.
- Does not provide health scoring — use gh-health skill for that.

## Input Sanitization

- Date values (--since): must be valid ISO 8601 date strings.
- Author identifiers: must be valid GitHub usernames — alphanumeric characters and hyphens only.
- Repository identifier: inferred from local git context; if provided, must match `owner/repo` format with alphanumeric characters and hyphens only.

# /gh-activity - Recent Activity Summary

Show recent activity in the repository including commits, PRs, issues, and releases.

## Usage

```bash
/gh-activity                # Activity in last 24 hours
/gh-activity --week         # Activity in last 7 days
/gh-activity --month        # Activity in last 30 days
/gh-activity --since 2025-01-01  # Since specific date
/gh-activity --author @user # Activity by specific user
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Time Range

```bash
# Default: last 24 hours
SINCE=$(date -v-1d +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)

# Or week
SINCE=$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)

# Or month
SINCE=$(date -v-30d +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
```

### Step 2: Gather Activity

```bash
# Recent commits
git log --since="$SINCE" --format="%h %s (%an, %ar)"

# Merged PRs
gh pr list --state merged --json number,title,author,mergedAt \
    --jq ".[] | select(.mergedAt > \"$SINCE\")"

# Opened issues
gh issue list --state all --json number,title,author,createdAt,state \
    --jq ".[] | select(.createdAt > \"$SINCE\")"

# New releases
gh release list --json tagName,publishedAt,name \
    --jq ".[] | select(.publishedAt > \"$SINCE\")"
```

### Step 3: Organize Timeline

Sort all events by time and present.

## Output Format
