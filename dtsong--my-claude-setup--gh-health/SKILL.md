## Scope Constraints

- Read-only GitHub API operations — queries issues, PRs, CI status, branches, and activity metrics.
- Does not create, modify, or close any GitHub resources.
- Does not perform triage actions — use gh-triage skill for labeling and assignment.

## Input Sanitization

- Focus flags (--issues, --prs, --ci): must be recognized option names only.
- Repository identifier: inferred from local git context; if provided, must match `owner/repo` format with alphanumeric characters and hyphens only.

# /gh-health - Repository Health Dashboard

Display a comprehensive health overview of the repository.

## Usage

```bash
/gh-health              # Full health dashboard
/gh-health --issues     # Focus on issues
/gh-health --prs        # Focus on pull requests
/gh-health --ci         # Focus on CI/Actions status
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Repository Info

```bash
# Get repo details
gh repo view --json name,owner,description,defaultBranchRef,issues,pullRequests

# Get open issues count
gh issue list --state open --json number | jq length

# Get open PRs count
gh pr list --state open --json number | jq length
```

### Step 2: Analyze Health Metrics

Check:
- Open issues (age, labels, assignment)
- Open PRs (age, review status, CI status)
- Recent activity
- Branch status
- CI/workflow health

### Step 3: Generate Dashboard

Compile all metrics into dashboard view.
