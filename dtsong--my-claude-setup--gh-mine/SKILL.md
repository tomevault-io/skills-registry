## Scope Constraints

- Read-only GitHub API operations — queries issues, PRs, review requests, and mentions assigned to or involving the authenticated user.
- Does not create, modify, or close issues or PRs.
- Does not perform triage or labeling — use gh-triage skill for that.

## Input Sanitization

- Filter flags (--issues, --prs, --reviews, --mentions): must be recognized option names only.
- Repository identifier: inferred from local git context; if provided, must match `owner/repo` format with alphanumeric characters and hyphens only.

# /gh-mine - My GitHub Items

Show issues, PRs, and mentions assigned to or involving you.

## Usage

```bash
/gh-mine                # All my items
/gh-mine --issues       # Only issues assigned to me
/gh-mine --prs          # Only PRs I'm involved with
/gh-mine --reviews      # PRs where my review is requested
/gh-mine --mentions     # Where I'm mentioned
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get Current User

```bash
# Get authenticated user
GH_USER=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
```

### Step 2: Fetch Assigned Items

```bash
# Issues assigned to me
gh issue list --assignee @me --state open --json number,title,labels,createdAt

# PRs I authored
gh pr list --author @me --state open --json number,title,state,reviews

# PRs where review requested
gh pr list --search "review-requested:@me" --json number,title,author

# Mentions
gh api search/issues --jq '.items' -f q="mentions:$GH_USER is:open"
```

### Step 3: Organize and Display

Group by type and priority.
