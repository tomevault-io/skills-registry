# Load Modeling

## Purpose

Model application load patterns and plan capacity to handle current and projected traffic. Produces a load model with growth projections, scaling trigger definitions, a benchmark plan for critical paths, and cost-at-scale estimates.

## Scope Constraints

- Reads: Traffic logs, APM dashboards, infrastructure metrics, billing data, SLA documents, architecture diagrams.
- Cannot: Profile rendering performance or measure Core Web Vitals (use performance-audit). Cannot design cache hierarchies or TTL policies (use caching-strategy). Cannot provision or deploy infrastructure changes.

## Inputs

- Current traffic data (requests/sec, concurrent users, peak vs average)
- Application architecture (services, databases, queues, external dependencies)
- Growth projections or business targets (user growth rate, launch events, seasonal spikes)
- Current infrastructure (instance types, database tier, CDN, serverless limits)
- SLA requirements (uptime target, max acceptable latency, error rate budget)

## Input Sanitization

No user-provided values are used in commands or file paths. All inputs are treated as read-only analysis targets.

## Procedure

### Progress Checklist
- [ ] Step 1: Estimate user load patterns
- [ ] Step 2: Model request distribution across endpoints
- [ ] Step 3: Identify resource bottlenecks at scale
- [ ] Step 4: Define horizontal and vertical scaling triggers
- [ ] Step 5: Design benchmark suite for critical paths
- [ ] Step 6: Plan capacity thresholds and alerts
- [ ] Step 7: Model cost-at-scale projections

### Step 1: Estimate User Load Patterns

Model the traffic shape:
- Average concurrent users and requests per second
- Peak-to-average ratio (daily peaks, weekly patterns, seasonal spikes)
- Growth trajectory — linear, exponential, or event-driven (launches, campaigns)
- Geographic distribution and timezone effects on peak timing
- Read vs write ratio across the application

### Step 2: Model Request Distribution Across Endpoints

Map traffic to specific system paths:
- Identify the top 10 endpoints by request volume
- Classify endpoints: read-heavy, write-heavy, compute-heavy, I/O-heavy
- Estimate per-endpoint resource cost (CPU time, memory, DB queries, external calls)
- Identify fan-out patterns (one user request triggers N downstream calls)
- Map dependency chains — which downstream services does each endpoint touch?

### Step 3: Identify Resource Bottlenecks at Scale

For each resource type, model where saturation occurs:
- **Database** — connection pool exhaustion, query throughput ceiling, storage growth
- **Application servers** — CPU saturation, memory pressure, thread/process limits
- **Network** — bandwidth limits, connection limits, DNS resolution latency
- **External services** — rate limits, timeout thresholds, quota exhaustion
- **Queues/workers** — queue depth growth, processing lag, dead letter accumulation

### Step 4: Define Horizontal and Vertical Scaling Triggers

Set thresholds that trigger scaling actions:
- CPU utilization threshold for auto-scaling (e.g., scale out at 70% sustained for 3 min)
- Memory utilization threshold
- Request queue depth or response latency threshold
- Database connection pool utilization threshold
- Define scale-up and scale-down policies (cooldown periods, min/max instances)
- Document manual scaling triggers for known events (launches, sales)

### Step 5: Design Benchmark Suite for Critical Paths

Define load tests that validate capacity:
- Identify the 5-10 most critical user journeys to benchmark
- Define load profiles: ramp-up, sustained, spike, soak (long-running)
- Specify success criteria per benchmark (p95 latency, error rate, throughput)
- Plan for realistic test data volume and variety
- Define the baseline benchmark to run before and after changes

### Step 6: Plan Capacity Thresholds and Alerts

Design the monitoring and alerting layer:
- Define warning thresholds (approaching limits) vs critical thresholds (at limits)
- Map each threshold to an alert channel and response playbook
- Set up dashboard panels for real-time capacity visibility
- Plan capacity review cadence (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Define runbook actions for each alert scenario

### Step 7: Model Cost-at-Scale Projections

Estimate infrastructure cost as traffic grows:
- Current monthly infrastructure cost breakdown
- Cost per additional 1,000 concurrent users (compute, database, bandwidth, CDN)
- Identify cost cliffs (tier upgrades, reserved instance thresholds)
- Model 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month cost projections
- Identify cost optimization opportunities (reserved instances, spot/preemptible, caching ROI)

## Handoff

- If bottleneck analysis reveals rendering or query-level performance issues, hand off to **tuner/performance-audit** for detailed profiling and optimization roadmap.
- If scaling projections show caching as a key cost-reduction lever, hand off to **tuner/caching-strategy** for cache hierarchy design and TTL policies.
