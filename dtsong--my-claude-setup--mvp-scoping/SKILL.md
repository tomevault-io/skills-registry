# MVP Scoping

## Purpose

Define the smallest viable scope that delivers maximum learning and value, using MoSCoW prioritization and value-effort analysis to draw a clear MVP cut line.

## Scope Constraints

Analyzes proposed features and requirements to produce prioritized scope recommendations. Does not make implementation decisions, estimate engineering timelines with precision, or commit resources. Scoping outputs are advisory and require stakeholder validation.

## Inputs

- Full list of proposed features and capabilities
- Target users and their primary jobs-to-be-done
- Timeline or launch constraints
- Team capacity (number of developers, available time)
- Key assumptions to validate
- Business goals or success criteria

## Input Sanitization

No user-provided values are used in commands or file paths. All inputs are treated as read-only analysis targets.

## Procedure

### Progress Checklist
- [ ] Step 1: Features enumerated
- [ ] Step 2: MoSCoW classification applied
- [ ] Step 3: Effort estimated
- [ ] Step 4: Value/impact estimated
- [ ] Step 5: Value-effort matrix plotted
- [ ] Step 6: MVP cut line defined
- [ ] Step 7: Phased roadmap planned

### Step 1: Enumerate All Proposed Features

- List every feature, capability, and requirement mentioned
- Break large features into independently shippable increments
- Include both functional features and non-functional requirements (performance, security, accessibility)
- Note the source of each request (user research, stakeholder, assumption, competitive parity)

### Step 2: Apply MoSCoW Classification

For each feature, classify:
- **Must have** — Without this, the product doesn't work or solve the core problem. Launch blocker.
- **Should have** — Important but the product is usable without it. Ship soon after launch.
- **Could have** — Nice to have, improves experience but not essential. Include if time permits.
- **Won't have (this time)** — Explicitly out of scope for this phase. Documented for future.

Decision test: "If we launched without this, would users still get value from the core use case?"

### Step 3: Estimate Effort for Each Feature

Use T-shirt sizing:
- **XS** — Less than half a day. Trivial change, well-understood.
- **S** — Half day to one day. Small feature, low complexity.
- **M** — Two to three days. Moderate complexity, some unknowns.
- **L** — One week. Significant feature, multiple components.
- **XL** — Two or more weeks. Large feature, many unknowns, high complexity.

Flag any estimates with high uncertainty for spike/prototype first.

### Step 4: Estimate Value/Impact for Each Feature

Rate each feature:
- **High** — Directly enables the core use case or removes a major friction point. Users would choose this product because of it.
- **Medium** — Improves the experience meaningfully. Users would notice if it were missing.
- **Low** — Polish or convenience. Users wouldn't choose or reject the product based on this.

Include rationale for each rating tied to user needs or business goals.

### Step 5: Plot Value-Effort Matrix

Arrange features into four quadrants:

```
  High Value │
             │  Strategic Bets    Quick Wins
             │  (High value,      (High value,
             │   High effort)      Low effort)
  ───────────┼──────────────────────────────
             │  Avoid             Fill-ins
             │  (Low value,       (Low value,
             │   High effort)      Low effort)
             │
             └──────────────────────────────
               High Effort ←──→ Low Effort
```

- **Quick Wins** (high value, low effort) — Do first
- **Strategic Bets** (high value, high effort) — Plan carefully, consider phasing
- **Fill-ins** (low value, low effort) — Include if time permits
- **Avoid** (low value, high effort) — Cut from MVP

### Step 6: Define the MVP Cut Line

- Start with all Must Haves (these are non-negotiable)
- Add Quick Wins (high value, low effort)
- Evaluate Strategic Bets for phased inclusion (can the first phase be smaller?)
- Total the effort and compare against available capacity
- Adjust until the MVP fits within timeline constraints
- Everything below the cut line becomes v1.1 or v2

### Step 7: Plan Phased Roadmap

- **v1 (MVP):** [Features above the cut line] — [Timeline]
- **v1.1 (Fast Follow):** [Should haves and remaining quick wins] — [Timeline]
- **v2 (Next Major):** [Strategic bets and could haves] — [Timeline]
- **Future:** [Won't haves and speculative features] — No timeline

Include milestones and key decision points between phases.

> **Compaction resilience**: If context was lost during a long session, re-read the Inputs section to reconstruct the feature list and constraints, check the Progress Checklist for completed steps, then resume from the earliest incomplete step.

## Output Format

### MoSCoW Table

| Feature | MoSCoW | Effort | Value | Quadrant | Phase |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| ... | Must | S | High | Quick Win | v1 |
| ... | Should | M | Medium | Fill-in | v1.1 |
| ... | Could | XL | High | Strategic Bet | v2 |
| ... | Won't | L | Low | Avoid | Future |

### Value-Effort Matrix

```

### MVP Feature Set (v1)

- [ ] Feature A (Must, S)
- [ ] Feature B (Must, M)
- [ ] Feature C (Should, XS) — Quick Win
- **Total estimated effort:** [sum]
- **MVP cut line rationale:** [why these features and not others]

### Phase Roadmap

| Phase | Features | Effort | Milestone | Decision Point |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| v1 | ... | ... | Launch | Validate core assumption |
| v1.1 | ... | ... | ... | Review user feedback |
| v2 | ... | ... | ... | Evaluate expansion |

## Handoff

- Hand off to impact-estimation if quantified RICE scoring is needed to resolve prioritization ties between features.
- Hand off to analytics-design if the MVP requires measurement instrumentation to validate key assumptions.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] All proposed features enumerated (nothing forgotten)
- [ ] MoSCoW classification justified with user-need rationale
- [ ] Effort estimates use consistent T-shirt sizing
- [ ] Value ratings tied to specific user needs or business goals
- [ ] Value-effort matrix plotted with all features
- [ ] MVP cut line is explicitly defined and justified
- [ ] Phased roadmap includes milestones and decision points
- [ ] Won't-haves are documented (not just deleted)
