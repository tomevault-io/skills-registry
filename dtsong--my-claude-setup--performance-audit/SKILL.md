description: Use when profiling application performance or diagnosing slow page loads. Covers full-stack bottleneck identification including Core Web Vitals, bundle analysis, database queries, and network waterfall. Do not use for cache architecture design (use caching-strategy) or capacity planning (use load-modeling).

# Performance Audit

## Purpose

Identify performance bottlenecks across the full stack — rendering, network, bundle, database, and infrastructure. Produces a profiled baseline, a prioritized bottleneck inventory, and an optimization roadmap with estimated impact for each recommendation.

## Scope Constraints

- Reads: Lighthouse reports, Core Web Vitals field data, bundle analyzer output, slow query logs, network waterfall traces, application source code.
- Cannot: Design caching hierarchies or TTL policies (use caching-strategy). Cannot model future traffic growth or define scaling triggers (use load-modeling). Cannot provision or deploy infrastructure changes.

## Inputs

- Application URL or local dev environment access
- Current performance complaints or targets (e.g., "page loads slowly", "LCP > 4s")
- Tech stack details (framework, database, hosting, CDN)
- Traffic profile (approximate users, peak times, geographic distribution)

## Input Sanitization

No user-provided values are used in commands or file paths. All inputs are treated as read-only analysis targets.

## Procedure

### Progress Checklist
- [ ] Step 1: Profile current performance baseline
- [ ] Step 2: Identify render bottlenecks
- [ ] Step 3: Analyze bundle size and code splitting
- [ ] Step 4: Audit database queries
- [ ] Step 5: Evaluate network waterfall
- [ ] Step 6: Assess Core Web Vitals scores
- [ ] Step 7: Recommend prioritized optimizations

### Step 1: Profile Current Performance Baseline

Run Lighthouse (or equivalent) on key pages. Record Core Web Vitals: LCP, CLS, INP, TTFB. Capture p50, p95, and p99 values where available. Document the baseline as the reference point for all improvements.

### Step 2: Identify Render Bottlenecks

Analyze the critical rendering path:
- Largest Contentful Paint — what element is the LCP candidate? Is it blocked by fonts, images, or JS?
- Cumulative Layout Shift — which elements shift? Are dimensions reserved?
- Interaction to Next Paint — which event handlers are slow? Is there long-task blocking?
- Time to First Byte — is the server response slow, or is it DNS/TLS overhead?

### Step 3: Analyze Bundle Size and Code Splitting

Inspect the JavaScript and CSS bundles:
- Total bundle size (compressed and uncompressed)
- Largest modules/chunks and their purpose
- Unused code ratio (tree shaking effectiveness)
- Code splitting boundaries — are routes lazy-loaded?
- Third-party script impact (analytics, chat widgets, ads)

### Step 4: Audit Database Queries

Review server-side data access patterns:
- Identify N+1 query patterns
- Check for missing indexes on filtered/sorted columns
- Review slow query logs or EXPLAIN plans for high-frequency queries
- Evaluate connection pooling configuration
- Check for unnecessary data fetching (selecting columns not used)

### Step 5: Evaluate Network Waterfall

Analyze the network request pattern:
- Total request count and payload size per page load
- Request sequencing — are there blocking chains?
- Compression (gzip/brotli) on text assets
- Image optimization (format, sizing, lazy loading)
- HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 multiplexing usage

### Step 6: Assess Core Web Vitals Scores

Compile field data (CrUX) and lab data (Lighthouse) into a scorecard:
- Green/amber/red status for each vital
- Comparison against industry benchmarks
- Mobile vs desktop performance gap
- Geographic performance variance if applicable

### Step 7: Recommend Prioritized Optimizations

Rank each finding by impact (estimated improvement) and effort (implementation cost):
- High impact / low effort — do immediately
- High impact / high effort — plan and schedule
- Low impact / low effort — batch together
- Low impact / high effort — skip or defer

> **Compaction resilience**: If context was lost during a long session, re-read the Inputs section to reconstruct what system is being analyzed, check the Progress Checklist for completed steps, then resume from the earliest incomplete step.

## Handoff

- If caching gaps are identified as a major bottleneck, hand off to **tuner/caching-strategy** for cache hierarchy design and TTL policy definition.
- If scaling or capacity concerns emerge from traffic analysis, hand off to **tuner/load-modeling** for capacity planning and scaling trigger definitions.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Baseline measurements are recorded with specific numbers, not vague descriptions
- [ ] Every bottleneck has a measured current value and an estimated improvement
- [ ] Optimizations are prioritized by impact-to-effort ratio
- [ ] Core Web Vitals are assessed for both mobile and desktop
- [ ] Database queries are reviewed with EXPLAIN plans or equivalent evidence
- [ ] Bundle analysis includes both first-party and third-party code
- [ ] Network waterfall identifies blocking request chains
- [ ] Recommendations include specific implementation steps, not just "optimize X"
