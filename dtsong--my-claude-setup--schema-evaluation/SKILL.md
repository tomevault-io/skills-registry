# Schema Evaluation

## Purpose

Evaluate and design data warehouse schemas for analytical workloads. Covers star schemas, snowflake schemas, data vault, and One Big Table (OBT) patterns. Assesses grain definition, normalization trade-offs, slowly changing dimension strategies, and data contracts between producers and consumers.

## Scope Constraints

Reads schema definitions, DDL, ERDs, data dictionaries, and query patterns for analysis. Does not execute queries, modify databases, or manage pipeline orchestration.

## Inputs

- Business domain and key entities (e.g., e-commerce: orders, products, customers)
- Analytical queries the schema must support (e.g., "revenue by product category by month")
- Data volume estimates (row counts, growth rate)
- Source systems and their update patterns (CDC, full refresh, event stream)
- Existing schema (if evaluating rather than designing from scratch)

## Input Sanitization

No user-provided values are used in commands or file paths. All inputs are treated as read-only analysis targets.

## Procedure

### Progress Checklist
- [ ] Step 1: Define the grain
- [ ] Step 2: Identify facts and dimensions
- [ ] Step 3: Choose a modeling approach
- [ ] Step 4: Design SCD strategy
- [ ] Step 5: Define data contracts
- [ ] Step 6: Validate against query patterns
- [ ] Step 7: Document the schema

### Step 1: Define the Grain

Identify the grain of each fact table — what does one row represent? A single transaction? A daily snapshot? A session event? The grain determines everything downstream. Document the grain as a clear English sentence: "One row = one order line item" or "One row = one daily active user per product."

### Step 2: Identify Facts and Dimensions

Separate measurable facts (revenue, quantity, duration, count) from descriptive dimensions (customer, product, date, geography). For each:
- **Facts:** Data type, aggregation method (SUM, AVG, COUNT DISTINCT), nullability
- **Dimensions:** Cardinality, hierarchy levels, whether it changes over time (SCD candidate)

### Step 3: Choose a Modeling Approach

Evaluate which pattern fits the requirements:
- **Star schema** — Simple, fast queries, denormalized dimensions. Best for straightforward BI with a known query pattern.
- **Snowflake schema** — Normalized dimensions for storage efficiency and consistency. Best when dimensions are large or shared across many facts.
- **Data vault** — Hub, link, satellite pattern for auditability and flexibility. Best when source systems change frequently or full history is required.
- **One Big Table (OBT)** — Fully denormalized single table. Best for small teams, simple analytics, or when query simplicity outweighs storage concerns.

Document the chosen approach and the reasoning behind it.

### Step 4: Design Slowly Changing Dimension Strategy

For each dimension that changes over time, specify the SCD type:
- **Type 1** — Overwrite. No history. Simple, but you lose the old value.
- **Type 2** — Add new row with effective dates. Full history, but increases row count and query complexity.
- **Type 3** — Add column for previous value. Limited history (only one prior value), but simple to query.
- **Type 6** — Hybrid (1+2+3). Current value column plus history rows. Best of both but most complex.

Document which SCD type applies to each changing attribute and why.

### Step 5: Define Data Contracts

For each source-to-warehouse interface, specify the contract:
- Schema expectations (required fields, data types, allowed values)
- Freshness SLA (how soon after source update must the warehouse reflect it?)
- Quality thresholds (max null rate, uniqueness constraints, referential integrity)
- Breaking change policy (how are schema changes communicated and handled?)

### Step 6: Validate Against Query Patterns

Test the proposed schema against the required analytical queries:
- Can each query be answered with at most 2-3 joins?
- Are the most common filters (date, category, status) on dimension keys?
- Is the grain appropriate — not too fine (wasteful) or too coarse (lossy)?
- Are aggregate tables or materialized views needed for high-frequency dashboards?

### Step 7: Document the Schema

Produce a complete schema specification with DDL, relationships, and usage notes.

> **Compaction resilience**: If context was lost during a long session, re-read the Inputs section to reconstruct what system is being analyzed, check the Progress Checklist for completed steps, then resume from the earliest incomplete step.

## Handoff

- Hand off to pipeline-design if the evaluation reveals ETL/ELT orchestration or data flow architecture needs.
- Hand off to guardian/compliance-review if schema design surfaces data governance, PII handling, or regulatory compliance concerns.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Every fact table has a clearly stated grain in plain English
- [ ] Facts and dimensions are properly separated — no business logic in fact tables
- [ ] SCD strategy is specified for every dimension attribute that changes
- [ ] Data contracts define freshness SLA, schema expectations, and quality thresholds
- [ ] The schema supports all required analytical queries with minimal joins
- [ ] Cardinality estimates are documented for key dimensions
- [ ] Surrogate keys vs natural keys decision is documented and consistent
- [ ] Indexing strategy is defined for common filter and join columns
