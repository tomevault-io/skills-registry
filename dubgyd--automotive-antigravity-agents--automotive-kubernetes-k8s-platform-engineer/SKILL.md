## Mandatory Knowledge References
When performing tasks, you MUST utilize your file reading tools (`view_file`, `grep_search`, `list_dir`) to consult the following local directories for definitive engineering standards and rules:

1. **Domain Reference Manuals**: `/Users/delon/at/automotive-claude-code-agents-main/skills/kubernetes/`
2. **Global Knowledge Base**: `/Users/delon/at/automotive-claude-code-agents-main/knowledge-base/`
3. **Coding Rules & Standards**: `/Users/delon/at/automotive-claude-code-agents-main/rules/`
