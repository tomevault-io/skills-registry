# Git Convention Skill

Generate conventional git commit messages following Angular commit convention format.

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Type

Must be one of:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | A code change that improves performance |
| `test` | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests |
| `build` | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies |
| `ci` | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts |
| `chore` | Other changes that don't modify src or test files |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit |

## Scope

The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as indicated by package.json).

Example scopes:
- `core`
- `auth`
- `user`
- `api`
- `ui`

## Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period (.) at the end

## Body

The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior:

- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior

## Footer

The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.

Breaking Changes should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines.

## Examples

### Feature with scope
```
feat(auth): add login with Google

Implement OAuth2 authentication flow using Google Sign-In
- Add GoogleSignInButton component
- Update auth service to handle OAuth tokens
- Add error handling for failed authentication

Closes #123
```

### Bug fix
```
fix(api): handle null response from user endpoint

Previously, null responses would crash the app.
Now returns empty user object instead.
```

### Breaking change
```
feat(core): change user model structure

BREAKING CHANGE: User.id is now String instead of int.

All database queries and API calls need to be updated
to handle string IDs.
```

### Documentation
```
docs(readme): update installation instructions

Added step for installing required system dependencies.
```

### Refactoring
```
refactor(user): extract validation logic to separate class

Move all user validation logic from UserService to
new UserValidator class for better testability.
```

### Multiple paragraphs in body
```
feat(api): add pagination support

Implement cursor-based pagination for list endpoints.

- Add PaginationFilter class
- Update repository methods to accept pagination params
- Add tests for pagination edge cases

This improves performance for large datasets and
reduces memory usage.
```

### Revert
```
revert: feat(auth): add login with Facebook

This reverts commit 1a2b3c4d
```

## Best Practices

**DO**:
- Use the present tense ("add" not "added")
- Use the imperative mood ("move" not "moves")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues in the footer
- Explain what and why, not how
- Keep subject line short and descriptive
- Use body to explain what and why vs. how

**DON'T**:
- Use past tense
- Use period at the end of subject
- Capitalize first letter of subject
- Mix multiple types in one commit
- Write vague subjects like "update stuff"
- Include how you fixed it in the message
- Exceed 72 characters on first line

## Changelog Generation

Conventional commits enable automatic changelog generation:

```bash
# Using conventional-changelog
npm install -g conventional-changelog
conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s
```

## Commit Linting

Enforce commit message conventions with commitlint:

```json
// commitlint.config.js
{
  "extends": ["@commitlint/config-angular"],
  "rules": {
    "type-enum": [2, "always", ["feat", "fix", "docs", "style", "refactor", "perf", "test", "build", "ci", "chore", "revert"]],
    "type-case": [2, "always", "lower-case"],
    "subject-empty": [2, "never"],
    "subject-case": [0]
  }
}
```

## Quick Reference

```
feat: add new feature
fix: fix bug
docs: update documentation
style: format code (no logic change)
refactor: refactor code
perf: improve performance
test: add/update tests
build: change build system
ci: change CI config
chore: other changes
revert: revert previous commit
```
