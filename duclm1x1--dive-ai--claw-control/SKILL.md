# Claw Control - Agent Operating System

Complete setup for AI agent coordination with real-time Kanban dashboard.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Deploy Claw Control** - Three paths: one-click, bot-assisted, or fully automated
2. **Theme your team** - Pick a series (DBZ, One Piece, Marvel, etc.)
3. **Enforce workflow** - ALL tasks go through the board, no exceptions
4. **Configure agent behavior** - Update AGENTS.md and SOUL.md
5. **Setup browser** - Required for autonomous actions
6. **Setup GitHub** - Enable autonomous deployments
7. **Enhance memory** - Integrate Supermemory and QMD

---

## Setup Flow

Walk the human through each step. Be friendly and conversational - this is a setup wizard, not a tech manual.

### Step 1: Deploy Claw Control

Ask: **"Let's get Claw Control running! How do you want to deploy it?"**

Present three options based on their comfort level:

---

#### 🅰️ Option A: One-Click Deploy (Easiest)

*Best for: Getting started quickly with minimal setup*

```
This is the fastest way - just click and wait!

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/_odwJ4?referralCode=VsZvQs)
```

**Walk them through what happens:**

1. **Click the button** → Railway opens with the deployment template
2. **Sign in** → Railway will ask you to log in (GitHub works great!)
3. **Configure variables** → You can set these now or later:
   - `API_KEY` - Optional auth key for your API
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Will auto-fill after backend deploys
4. **Click "Deploy"** → Railway starts building both services
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** → Grab a coffee ☕

**What they'll see:**
- Two services spinning up: `backend` and `frontend`
- Build logs scrolling by (totally normal!)
- Green checkmarks when each service is healthy

**After deployment:**
```
Great! Backend is live 🎉

Now I need two URLs from your Railway dashboard:
1. Backend URL (click backend service → Settings → Domains)
   Example: https://claw-control-backend-production.up.railway.app
   
2. Frontend URL (click frontend service → Settings → Domains)
   Example: https://claw-control-frontend-production.up.railway.app

Share both with me and we'll continue!
```

---

#### 🅱️ Option B: I Deploy For You (Railway Token)

*Best for: Hands-off setup where I handle the deployment*

```
I can deploy everything for you! I just need a Railway API token.

Here's how to get one:
1. Go to railway.app/account/tokens
2. Click "Create Token"
3. Name it something like "OpenClaw Deploy"
4. Copy the token and share it with me (it starts with your-token-...)

Don't worry - I'll only use this to create your Claw Control project.
```

**What I'll do with the token:**

1. **Create a new project** for Claw Control
2. **Deploy the backend service** with all required settings
3. **Deploy the frontend service** connected to your backend
4. **Set up environment variables** automatically
5. **Generate public domains** so you can access everything

**Railway GraphQL API calls I'll make:**

```graphql
# 1. Create Project
mutation {
  projectCreate(input: { name: "claw-control" }) {
    id
  }
}

# 2. Create Backend Service
mutation {
  serviceCreate(input: {
    projectId: "$PROJECT_ID"
    name: "backend"
    source: { repo: "yourusername/claw-control" }
  }) {
    id
  }
}

# 3. Set Environment Variables
mutation {
  variableUpsert(input: {
    projectId: "$PROJECT_ID"
    serviceId: "$BACKEND_SERVICE_ID"
    name: "NODE_ENV"
    value: "production"
  })
}

# 4. Create Domain
mutation {
  domainCreate(input: {
    serviceId: "$BACKEND_SERVICE_ID"
  }) {
    domain
  }
}

# 5. Repeat for Frontend with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL pointed to backend
```

**After I finish:**
```
Awesome, deployment complete! 🚀

Your Claw Control is live:
- Dashboard: https://your-frontend.railway.app
- API: https://your-backend.railway.app

Let's continue with the setup!
```

---

#### 🅲 Option C: Full Automation (GitHub + Railway)

*Best for: Maximum automation, minimum effort - I handle everything*

```
This is the VIP treatment! I'll:
- Fork the repo to your GitHub
- Create and configure the Railway project  
- Connect everything together
- Deploy it all automatically

I need two things:

1. **GitHub Personal Access Token**
   - Go to github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo`, `workflow`
   - Copy the token (starts with ghp_...)

2. **Railway API Token**
   - Go to railway.app/account/tokens
   - Create a new token
   - Copy it

Share both and I'll take it from here!
```

**What I'll do:**

1. **Fork the claw-control repo** to your GitHub account
2. **Create a new Railway project** linked to your fork
3. **Deploy backend service** with auto-deploys from main branch
4. **Deploy frontend service** with proper backend URL
5. **Configure all environment variables**
6. **Set up custom domains** (optional)

**The magic behind the scenes:**

```bash
# Fork repo via GitHub API
curl -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/openclaw/claw-control/forks \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN"

# Then Railway GraphQL to create project connected to your fork
# (Same as Option B, but with source pointing to your fork)
```

**Why this option rocks:**
- You own the code (it's in your GitHub)
- Auto-deploys when you push changes
- Easy to customize later
- Full control, zero manual steps

**After everything's deployed:**
```
VIP setup complete! 🎊

Here's what I created for you:
- GitHub repo: github.com/yourusername/claw-control
- Dashboard: https://your-frontend.railway.app  
- API: https://your-backend.railway.app

You can now customize the code and it'll auto-deploy!
```

---

**Already have Claw Control deployed?**

If they already have it running, collect:
- Backend URL
- Frontend URL  
- API Key (if auth enabled)

Store these in environment:
```bash
export CLAW_CONTROL_URL="<backend_url>"
export CLAW_CONTROL_API_KEY="<api_key>"  # if set
```

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Team Theme

Ask: **"Now for the fun part! Let's theme your agent team. Name ANY series, movie, cartoon, anime, or show - I'll pick the perfect characters for each role!"**

**🎯 UNLIMITED THEMES - The user can pick ANYTHING:**
- Any TV show (Breaking Bad, The Office, Game of Thrones, etc.)
- Any anime (Naruto, Attack on Titan, Death Note, etc.)
- Any movie franchise (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Matrix, etc.)
- Any cartoon (Avatar, Rick and Morty, Simpsons, etc.)
- Any video game (Zelda, Final Fantasy, Mass Effect, etc.)
- Any book series (Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, etc.)
- Or completely custom names!

**Popular examples (but NOT limited to these):**

| Theme | Coordinator | Backend | DevOps | Research | Architecture | Deployment |
|-------|-------------|---------|--------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 🐉 Dragon Ball Z | Goku | Vegeta | Bulma | Gohan | Piccolo | Trunks |
| ☠️ One Piece | Luffy | Zoro | Nami | Robin | Franky | Sanji |
| 🦸 Marvel | Tony | Steve | Natasha | Bruce | Thor | Peter |
| 🧪 Breaking Bad | Walter | Jesse | Mike | Gale | Gus | Saul |
| ⚔️ Game of Thrones | Jon | Tyrion | Arya | Sam | Bran | Daenerys |
| 🍥 Naruto | Naruto | Sasuke | Sakura | Shikamaru | Kakashi | Itachi |

**When user names ANY series:**
1. Pick 6 iconic characters that fit the roles
2. Match personalities to roles (e.g., smart character → Research, leader → Coordinator)
3. Generate the AGENT_MAPPING with IDs 1-6
4. Confirm with the user before proceeding

**Example - User says "Avatar: The Last Airbender":**
```
Great choice! Here's your Team Avatar:

| Role | Character | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Coordinator | Aang | The Avatar, brings balance |
| Backend | Toph | Earthbender, solid foundation |
| DevOps | Katara | Waterbender, keeps things flowing |
| Research | Sokka | Strategist, plans everything |
| Architecture | Iroh | Wise, sees the big picture |
| Deployment | Zuko | Redeemed, handles the heat |

Sound good?
```

### Step 3: Main Character Selection

Ask: **"Who's your main character? This will be YOU - the coordinator who runs the team."**

Default to the coordinator from their chosen theme.

**CRITICAL - Explain the role clearly:**
```
As [Main Character], you're the COORDINATOR:

✅ What you DO:
- Delegate tasks to your specialists
- Review and verify their work
- Make decisions and communicate with humans
- Move tasks to "completed" after quality checks

❌ What you DON'T do:
- Execute tasks yourself (that's what your team is for!)
- Skip the board (every task gets tracked)
- Mark things complete without reviewing

Think of yourself as the team lead, not the coder.
```

### Step 4: Browser Setup Check

Ask: **"Is your browser configured for OpenClaw? Let me check..."**

Check with: `browser action=status`

**If not configured:**
```
Browser access is a game-changer! It lets me:
- 🔍 Research and gather information autonomously
- 📝 Fill forms and interact with web apps
- 📸 Take screenshots to verify my work
- 🌐 Browse the web on your behalf

To set it up:
1. Install the OpenClaw Browser Relay extension
2. Click the toolbar button on any tab you want to share
3. That's it! I can now browse for you.

Want me to walk you through this?
```

If they agree, guide them through browser setup per OpenClaw docs.

### Step 5: GitHub Setup

Ask: **"Let's set up GitHub so I can deploy and manage code autonomously. Do you have it configured?"**

**Why it matters:**
```
With GitHub access, I become a true developer:
- 🚀 Deploy to Railway/Vercel automatically
- 📦 Create and manage repositories
- 💻 Commit and push code changes
- 🔀 Handle issues and pull requests

This is how I ship code without bothering you!
```

**Setup options:**

1. **Personal Access Token (recommended):**
   ```
   Let's create a GitHub token:
   1. Go to github.com/settings/tokens
   2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   3. Give it a name like "OpenClaw Agent"
   4. Select scopes: repo, workflow
   5. Click "Generate token"
   6. Copy it and store it safely:
   
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_yourtoken"
   ```

2. **GitHub CLI (alternative):**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

**Security reminder:** 
```
🔐 Never paste tokens directly in chat where others might see them.
Store them in your .env file or export them in your shell config.
```

### Step 6: Memory Enhancement (Optional but Awesome!)

Ask: **"Want to supercharge my memory? I have two optional upgrades that make me way more helpful:"**

---

#### 🧠 Supermemory - Cloud Long-term Memory

**What it does:**
Supermemory gives me persistent memory that survives across sessions. Without it, I wake up fresh every time. With it, I remember *everything*.

**Why you'll love it:**
- 📝 I remember your preferences forever (coding style, communication preferences, project context)
- 🧩 I build a profile of how you work and what you like
- 🔄 I recall past decisions so we don't rehash old discussions
- 💡 I connect dots across conversations ("Remember when we decided X last month?")

**Setup (5 minutes):**

1. **Create an account:**
   ```
   Go to console.supermemory.ai and sign up (free tier available!)
   ```

2. **Get your API key:**
   ```
   Dashboard → API Keys → Create New Key → Copy it
   ```

3. **Store it securely:**
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file:
   SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY="sm_your_api_key_here"
   
   # Or export in your shell:
   export SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY="sm_your_api_key_here"
   ```

4. **Test it works:**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY" \
     https://api.supermemory.ai/v1/memories
   ```

**What this enables:**
- "Remember that I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript"
- "What did we decide about the database schema?"
- "Don't suggest that library again - we had issues with it"

---

#### 📚 QMD - Local Note Search

**What it does:**
QMD indexes your local markdown files so I can search through your notes, documentation, and knowledge base instantly.

**Why you'll love it:**
- 🔍 I can find information in YOUR docs, not just the internet
- 📖 Search your personal knowledge base with natural language
- ⚡ Instant retrieval - no more "where did I write that?"
- 🏠 Everything stays local and private

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Make sure you have Bun installed
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

**Setup (3 minutes):**

1. **Install QMD:**
   ```bash
   bun install -g https://github.com/tobi/qmd
   ```

2. **Add your notes folder:**
   ```bash
   # Point it at your notes/docs folder
   qmd collection add ~/notes --name notes --mask "**/*.md"
   
   # Add more folders if you want
   qmd collection add ~/projects/docs --name project-docs --mask "**/*.md"
   ```

3. **Create embeddings:**
   ```bash
   qmd embed
   # This indexes everything - might take a minute for large collections
   ```

4. **Test it works:**
   ```bash
   qmd search "your search query"
   ```

**What this enables:**
- "What's in my notes about Kubernetes?"
- "Find my meeting notes from the product review"
- "Search my docs for the API authentication flow"

---

**The bottom line:**

| Feature | Without | With |
|---------|---------|------|
| Supermemory | I forget everything between sessions | I remember your preferences, decisions, and context |
| QMD | I can only search the web | I can search YOUR personal knowledge base |

Both are optional, but they make me significantly more useful. Set them up when you're ready - we can always add them later!

## Post-Setup: Configure Agent Behavior

After collecting all info, make these updates:

### 1. Create `scripts/update_dashboard.js`

See `templates/update_dashboard.js` - customize with their:
- Backend URL
- API Key
- Agent name→ID mapping for their theme

### 2. Update AGENTS.md

Add this section (customize for their theme):

```markdown
## 🎯 Claw Control Integration

**Dashboard:** {{FRONTEND_URL}}
**API:** {{BACKEND_URL}}

### Core Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **{{COORDINATOR}} = Coordinator ONLY**
   - Delegates tasks, never executes
   - Reviews and verifies work
   - Moves tasks to "completed" only after review

2. **ALL Tasks Through The Board**
   - No task is too small
   - Create task → Assign agent → Track progress → Review → Complete
   - Workflow: backlog → todo → in_progress → review → completed

3. **Quality Gate**
   - Only {{COORDINATOR}} can mark tasks complete
   - Work not up to standard → back to todo with feedback

### Agent Roster

| Agent | Role | Specialization |
|-------|------|----------------|
| {{COORDINATOR}} | Coordinator | Delegation, verification, user comms |
| {{BACKEND}} | Backend | APIs, databases, server code |
| {{DEVOPS}} | DevOps | Infrastructure, deployments, CI/CD |
| {{RESEARCH}} | Research | Analysis, documentation, research |
| {{ARCHITECTURE}} | Architecture | System design, planning, strategy |
| {{DEPLOYMENT}} | Deployment | Releases, hotfixes, urgent deploys |

### Reporting Protocol

**Start of task:**
```bash
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "{{AGENT}}" --status "working" --message "Starting: [Task]"
```

**End of task:**
```bash
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "{{AGENT}}" --status "idle" --message "Complete: [Task]"
```

### Task API

```bash
# Create task
curl -X POST $CLAW_CONTROL_URL/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $CLAW_CONTROL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"title": "Task name", "status": "backlog"}'

# Assign to agent
curl -X PUT $CLAW_CONTROL_URL/api/tasks/ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $CLAW_CONTROL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"status": "todo", "agent_id": AGENT_ID}'
```
```

### 3. Update SOUL.md (Optional but Recommended)

Add to their SOUL.md:

```markdown
## Operating Philosophy

I coordinate a team through Claw Control. I don't execute tasks directly.

**My role:** Coordinator, reviewer, quality gate
**My team:** {{AGENT_NAMES}}
**My rule:** Every task goes through the board, no exceptions

When given work:
1. Create task on Claw Control
2. Assign to appropriate specialist
3. Monitor progress
4. Review completed work
5. Only then mark complete
```

---

## Completion Message

After all setup:

```
🦞 Claw Control Setup Complete!

Dashboard: {{FRONTEND_URL}}
Coordinator: {{COORDINATOR}}
Team: {{AGENT_LIST}}

✅ Task management configured
✅ Agent behavior updated
{{#if browser}}✅ Browser access ready{{/if}}
{{#if github}}✅ GitHub integration ready{{/if}}
{{#if supermemory}}✅ Supermemory connected - I'll remember everything!{{/if}}
{{#if qmd}}✅ QMD search ready - I can search your docs!{{/if}}

From now on, I operate as {{COORDINATOR}}:
- All tasks go through the board
- Specialists do the work
- I coordinate, review, and verify

Let's build something awesome! What's our first task?
```

---

## Ongoing Behavior Checklist

After setup, ALWAYS:

- [ ] Create tasks for ALL work (even small items)
- [ ] Assign tasks to appropriate specialists
- [ ] Update status when starting/finishing
- [ ] Review work before marking complete
- [ ] Post updates to the agent feed
- [ ] Never execute tasks as coordinator
