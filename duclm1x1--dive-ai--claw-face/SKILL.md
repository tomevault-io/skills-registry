# 🤖 ClawFace

**Give your OpenClaw a face!**

---

Got a dedicated machine running OpenClaw with a monitor? Tired of staring at logs all day? 

**Give your agent a personality!**

- **9 emotions** — from happy to angry, thinking to proud
- **9 actions** — coding, searching, reading, speaking...
- **15 visual effects** — matrix rain, fire, confetti, radar scan...

That's **1,215 unique combinations** + custom messages from your agent!

Perfect for:
- 💻 Laptop setups where you want to SEE your agent working
- 🖥️ Dedicated OpenClaw machines with a monitor
- 🎮 Making your AI assistant feel alive
- 📺 Impressing your friends/coworkers

> ⚠️ **Note:** Only tested on macOS. Should work on Windows/Linux but YMMV.

## 🚀 Quick Test (try it now!)

```bash
# 1. Check if you have Python + tkinter:
python3 -c "import tkinter; print('Ready!')"
```

**Terminal 1 — Run ClawFace:**
```bash
python3 SKILL_PATH/scripts/avatar.py --mode robot
```

**Terminal 2 — Run Demo:**
```bash
python3 SKILL_PATH/scripts/avatar.py --demo
```

Watch the avatar cycle through all emotions, actions, and effects automatically! 🎉

### Manual control:
```bash
echo '{"emotion":"excited","action":"success","effect":"confetti","message":"It works!"}' > ~/.clawface/avatar_state.json
```

---

## ⚠️ Requirements

**Python 3.10+ with tkinter:**
```bash
# Check:
python3 -c "import tkinter; print('OK')"

# Install if missing:
# macOS:   brew install python-tk@3.14
# Ubuntu:  sudo apt install python3-tk
# Windows: reinstall Python, check "tcl/tk and IDLE" during install
```

---

## 📦 Full Installation

### 1. Install the auto-thinking hook (recommended):
```bash
cp -r SKILL_PATH/hooks/clawface-thinking ~/.openclaw/hooks/
openclaw hooks enable clawface-thinking
```
This makes the avatar show "thinking" automatically when a turn starts — no delay!

### 2. Launch the avatar:
```bash
nohup python3 SKILL_PATH/scripts/avatar.py --mode robot > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

**Note:** Replace `SKILL_PATH` with actual path, e.g., `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills/clawface`

## 🎯 Core Principle: BE DYNAMIC!

**Don't set one state and forget it.** Update the avatar continuously as you work:

```
User asks question
  → thinking/reading    (reading their message)
  → thinking/thinking   (analyzing)
  → happy/speaking      (formulating response)  
  → neutral/idle        (sent, waiting)
```

Every action you take should be reflected. The avatar is your LIVE status indicator.

## ⚡ Best Practices

### 🔴 MINIMUM FLOW FOR EVERY RESPONSE:
```
thinking  →  processing user input
speaking  →  sending your reply  
idle      →  done, waiting
```
**This is mandatory.** Every single reply should show this progression.

### Tips:
1. **Update BEFORE each action** — set `reading` before you read
2. **Update AFTER completion** — show `success`/`error`, then `idle`
3. **Match intensity** — small task = subtle, big task = expressive
4. **Always return to idle** — when waiting for user
