# Clawdbot Sync 🔄

Synchronize memory, preferences, and skills between multiple Clawdbot instances over Tailscale/SSH.

## Features

- **Bi-directional sync** between Clawdbot instances
- **Smart conflict resolution** (newest wins, or merge for logs)
- **Selective sync** — choose what to sync
- **Peer discovery** via Tailscale
- **Dry-run mode** for preview

## Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/sync` | Show status and configured peers |
| `/sync status` | Check connection to all peers |
| `/sync now [peer]` | Sync with peer (or all) |
| `/sync push [peer]` | Push local changes to peer |
| `/sync pull [peer]` | Pull changes from peer |
| `/sync add <name> <host> [user] [path]` | Add a peer |
| `/sync remove <name>` | Remove a peer |
| `/sync diff [peer]` | Show what would change |
| `/sync history` | Show sync history |

## Setup

### 1. Configure Peers

```bash
handler.sh add mac-mini 100.95.193.55 clawdbot /Users/clawdbot/clawd $WORKSPACE
handler.sh add server 100.89.48.26 clawdbot /home/clawdbot/clawd $WORKSPACE
```

### 2. Ensure SSH Access

Both machines need SSH key auth:
```bash
ssh-copy-id clawdbot@100.95.193.55
```

### 3. Test Connection

```bash
handler.sh status $WORKSPACE
```

## What Gets Synced

| Item | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `memory/` | ✅ Yes | All memory files and skill data |
| `MEMORY.md` | ✅ Yes | Main memory file |
| `USER.md` | ✅ Yes | User profile |
| `IDENTITY.md` | ❌ No | Each instance has its own identity |
| `skills/` | ⚙️ Optional | Installed skills |
| `config/` | ❌ No | Instance-specific config |

## Handler Commands

```bash
handler.sh status $WORKSPACE                    # Check peers and connection
handler.sh sync <peer> $WORKSPACE               # Bi-directional sync
handler.sh push <peer> $WORKSPACE               # Push to peer
handler.sh pull <peer> $WORKSPACE               # Pull from peer
handler.sh diff <peer> $WORKSPACE               # Show differences
handler.sh add <name> <host> <user> <path> $WS  # Add peer
handler.sh remove <name> $WORKSPACE             # Remove peer
handler.sh history $WORKSPACE                   # Sync history
handler.sh auto <on|off> $WORKSPACE             # Auto-sync on heartbeat
```

## Conflict Resolution

1. **Timestamp-based**: Newer file wins
2. **Merge for logs**: Append-only files are merged
3. **Skip conflicts**: Option to skip conflicting files
4. **Manual resolution**: Flag for review

## Data Files

Stored in `$WORKSPACE/memory/clawdbot-sync/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `peers.json` | Configured peers |
| `history.json` | Sync history log |
| `config.json` | Sync preferences |
| `conflicts/` | Conflicting files for review |

## Example Session

```
User: /sync now mac-mini
Bot: 🔄 Syncing with mac-mini (100.95.193.55)...

     📤 Pushing: 3 files changed
     • memory/streaming-buddy/preferences.json
     • memory/2026-01-26.md
     • MEMORY.md
     
     📥 Pulling: 1 file changed
     • memory/2026-01-25.md
     
     ✅ Sync complete! 4 files synchronized.
```

## Requirements

- `rsync` (for efficient file sync)
- `ssh` (for secure transport)
- Tailscale or direct network access between peers
- SSH key authentication configured

## Security

- Uses SSH for all transfers (encrypted)
- No passwords stored (key-based auth only)
- Sync paths are restricted to workspace
- No system files are ever synced
