# Countries Lookup

Uses REST Countries API (v3.1). No account or API key needed.

| List all | `countries all` |

### Examples

```bash
countries search "united states"   # Find country by name
countries info US                  # Get full details by alpha-2 code
countries info USA                 # Also works with alpha-3
countries region europe            # All European countries
countries capital tokyo            # Find country by capital

## Agent Implementation Notes

**Script location:** `{skill_folder}/countries` (wrapper to `scripts/countries`)

**When user asks about countries:**
1. Run `./countries search "name"` to find country code
2. Run `./countries info <code>` for full details
3. Run `./countries region <region>` for regional lists
4. Run `./countries capital "city"` to find by capital

**Common patterns:**
- "What country is X in?" → search by name
- "Tell me about X" → search, then info with code
- "Countries in Europe" → region europe
- "Capital of X" → info with code, check capital field
- "What country has capital X?" → capital search

**Don't use for:** Historical countries, disputed territories, non-sovereign regions.
