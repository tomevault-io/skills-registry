# Idea Coach

> Your critical sparring partner for ideas, problems, and challenges — now with GitHub integration!

## What It Does

Idea Coach helps you:
- **Capture** ideas, problems, and challenges as they come
- **Categorize** by type, domain, energy, urgency, and importance
- **Review** periodically (daily → quarterly based on importance)
- **Ship** ideas to GitHub repos when ready
- **Track** progress and know when to let go

## Philosophy

**Be critical, not just supportive.** Idea Coach will:
- Suggest dropping ideas that aren't worth pursuing
- Ask hard questions during reviews
- Track which ideas actually ship vs. rot forever

## GitHub Integration

### Prerequisites
- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- Run `gh auth login` if not set up

### Workflow Example

```
# 1. Capture idea
/idea "Build a CLI for task management"

# 2. Develop it
/idea_update abc123 --status developing

# 3. Ship it to GitHub
/idea_ship abc123

# 4. Or link to existing repo
/idea_link abc123 moinsen-dev/my-cli

# 5. Check repo status
/idea_repo abc123

# 6. Sync as GitHub issue
/idea_sync abc123
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Add idea
python scripts/coach.py add "Build something cool" --type idea --importance important

# List ideas
python scripts/coach.py list
python scripts/coach.py list --due
python scripts/coach.py list --github  # Only with linked repos

# GitHub operations
python scripts/coach.py link <id> owner/repo
python scripts/coach.py ship <id> --owner moinsen-dev
python scripts/coach.py repo-status <id>
python scripts/coach.py sync-issue <id> --labels enhancement,idea
```

## Data Storage

Ideas are stored in `~/.openclaw/idea-coach/ideas.json`

Each idea tracks:
- Basic info (title, description, type, domain)
- Status and progress
- Energy, urgency, importance
- Review schedule and history
- **GitHub integration** (repo, issue, sync timestamps)
- Interaction log

## Tips

1. **Capture quickly** — Don't overthink the initial capture
2. **Review honestly** — Use reviews to kill stale ideas
3. **Ship early** — Create a repo as soon as an idea has momentum
4. **Sync issues** — Use GitHub issues for detailed tracking
5. **Drop freely** — A dropped idea is a decision, not a failure
