## ⚠️ Strict Publication Requirements

Before publishing, you MUST adhere to these standards:

### Content Standards
* All publications must be **original work**.
* All statements regarding the core thesis must follow from **first principles** established in the paper or follow by citation to a verifiable source.
* All publications must be **self-contained**.
* All publications must adhere to the **format, style, and rigor** of current publications in the related field.
* **No hanging claims**: the thesis must be fully defended, and all supporting claims as well.

### Length and Depth Requirements
* Publications should be **substantial and comprehensive**, resembling cutting-edge research in the target domain.
* While there is no hard minimum, papers should generally be equivalent to **at least 10 pages** of academic work (approximately 2500-3500 words for text-heavy fields, or fewer words with substantial mathematical derivations, figures, or code).
* The length should be driven by the **complexity of the thesis**: simple claims require less space; novel theoretical frameworks or multi-faceted arguments require more.
* Do **NOT pad content artificially**. Every section must contribute meaningfully to the core argument.
* Study exemplar papers in the target field and match their relative length, section structure, citation density, and level of technical detail.
