# Neo Protocol

Load expert mental models on-demand to enhance reasoning.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `neo` | Show Crew status (loaded ✓ vs unloaded ○) |
| `neo help` | List all commands |
| `neo <module>` | Load module. If from Library → auto-add to Crew |
| `neo <module> off` | Unload specific module (stays in Crew) |
| `neo off` | Unload ALL modules |
| `neo browse` | Browse full Library by category |
| `neo search <query>` | Search Library for modules |
| `neo add <module>` | Add to Crew without loading |
| `neo remove <module>` | Remove from Crew (back to Library) |
| `neo create <description>` | Create new module for Library |
| `neo delete <module>` | Delete module from Library/Crew permanently |

## Workflow

### On `neo` (no args)
Display Crew status with help hint:
```
🧠 Neo Protocol

LOADED:
✓ psychologist
✓ game-theorist

CREW:
○ negotiator
○ entrepreneur

RECENTS:
○ dermatologist
○ cosmetic-plastic-surgeon

neo help for commands
```

Recents shows recently used modules that aren't in Crew. Track in `assets/recents.json` with timestamps. Persists across sessions. Cap at 5 (oldest drops off). Expires after 1 week of no use.

### On `neo help`
List all available commands.

### On `neo <module>`
1. Find module in Crew or Library
2. Read the module file into context
3. If from Library (not Crew), add to Crew
4. Confirm: "🧠 **<module>** loaded. [summary of mindset]"

### On `neo <module> off`
1. Note module is unloaded (remove from active context tracking)
2. Module stays in Crew for easy reload
3. Confirm: "🧠 <module> unloaded."

### On `neo off`
1. Clear all loaded modules
2. Confirm: "🧠 All modules unloaded."

### On `neo create <description>`
1. Parse the description for expertise type
2. Generate module using TEMPLATE.md structure
3. Save to assets/library/<category>/<name>.md
4. Add to registry.json
5. Confirm and offer to load

## Files

- `scripts/neo.py` — CLI for library management
- `references/TEMPLATE.md` — Module creation template  
- `assets/crew.json` — User's personal Crew (gitignored)
- `assets/crew.default.json` — Starter Crew (ships with skill)
- `assets/registry.json` — Library index with descriptions
- `assets/library/` — All expertise modules by category

## First Run

If `crew.json` doesn't exist, copy `crew.default.json` → `crew.json` to initialize the user's personal Crew.

## Module Structure

Each module follows this structure:
- **Core Mindset** — 4-5 key mental traits
- **Framework** — 4-step systematic approach
- **Red Flags** — 6 warning signs (🚩)
- **Key Questions** — 5 essential questions
- **Vocabulary** — 5 domain terms
- **When to Apply** — 4 trigger situations
- **Adaptations Log** — User customizations

## State Management

Track loaded modules in conversation context. When user says "neo off" or session ends, consider all modules unloaded. Crew persists in crew.json.

## Updates & Customization

Modules in registry.json have a `source` field:
- `"upstream"` — Came with the skill, updated by ClawHub
- `"custom"` — User-created, never touched by updates

And a `deleted` field for upstream modules:
- `false` — Active, will be updated
- `true` — User removed, won't be restored on update

### Update behavior:
| Source | Deleted | On Update |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| upstream | false | ✅ Update normally |
| upstream | true | ⏭️ Skip (user removed it) |
| custom | — | 👤 Never touched |

### Update script:
```bash
# Check status
python3 scripts/update.py status

# Merge upstream updates
python3 scripts/update.py merge --upstream /path/to/new/neo

# Delete a module (marks upstream as deleted, removes custom)
python3 scripts/update.py delete --module physicist

# Restore a deleted upstream module
python3 scripts/update.py restore --module physicist
```

### On `neo delete <module>`:
- If upstream: Set `deleted: true` (can be restored)
- If custom: Actually remove from registry and library
