# seekdb Documentation Skill

This skill provides comprehensive documentation for the seekdb database. When users ask about seekdb-related topics, you should use the documentation catalog to locate and read the relevant documentation.

## Documentation Access Strategy

This skill supports **remote-only** documentation access: the catalog and document files are fetched from GitHub.

### Remote Documentation URLs

- **Base URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/`
- **Catalog File**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/450.reference/1600.seekdb-docs-catalog.md`
- **Full Document URL**: Base URL + File Path (from catalog)

## How to Use This Skill

When a user asks about seekdb, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Access the Documentation Catalog

1. Fetch the remote catalog: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/450.reference/1600.seekdb-docs-catalog.md`
2. If the request fails (network error, timeout, etc.), inform the user that the documentation is currently unavailable and suggest retrying later

The catalog contains:
- All documentation entries organized by category
- File paths for each documentation file
- Descriptions of what each document covers
- Quick reference section for common topics

### Step 2: Match the Query to Documentation

Search through the catalog for entries whose **Description** matches the user's query. Look for:
- Exact keyword matches (e.g., "jina" → "Jina model integration")
- Related terms (e.g., "integration" → entries under "Model Platform Integrations", "Framework Integrations", etc.)
- Category matches (e.g., "vector search" → entries under "Vector Search" section)

The catalog is organized into these main categories:
- **Get Started**: Quick start tutorials and basic operations
- **Development Guide**: Vector search, hybrid search, AI functions, MCP server, multi-model data
- **Integrations**: Frameworks, model platforms, developer tools, workflows, MCP clients
- **Guides**: Deployment, management, security, OBShell, performance testing
- **Reference**: SQL syntax, PL, error codes, SDK APIs
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step tutorials and scenarios

### Step 3: Read the Documentation File

Once you've identified the matching entry, construct the full URL and fetch the document:

- Full URL = `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/` + File Path
- Example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/200.develop/600.search/300.vector-search/300.vector-similarity-search.md`

Fetch the document content from this URL to answer the user.

## Examples

### Example 1: Remote Access
**User**: "How do I use vector search in seekdb?"

**Process**:
1. Fetch remote catalog: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/450.reference/1600.seekdb-docs-catalog.md`
2. Find entries under "Vector Search" section
3. Fetch remote doc: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/200.develop/600.search/300.vector-search/100.vector-search-intro.md`

### Example 2: Overview Query
**User**: "What is seekdb?"

**Process**:
1. Fetch remote catalog: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/450.reference/1600.seekdb-docs-catalog.md`
2. Find entry under "Seekdb Overview"
3. Fetch remote doc: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/100.get-started/10.overview/10.seekdb-overview.md`

### Example 3: Subsequent Query in Same Conversation
**User**: "Now tell me about hybrid search"
(Previous query in this conversation successfully used remote)

**Process**:
1. Already have the catalog from previous fetch
2. Find entries under "Hybrid Search" section from the catalog
3. Fetch remote doc: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/200.develop/600.search/500.hybrid-search.md`

### Example 4: Integration Query
**User**: "I want to integrate seekdb with jina"

**Process**:
1. Fetch remote catalog: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/450.reference/1600.seekdb-docs-catalog.md`
2. Find entry under "Model Platform Integrations": "Guide to integrating seekdb vector search with Jina AI..."
3. Extract file path: `300.integrations/200.model-platforms/100.jina.md`
4. Fetch remote doc: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/300.integrations/200.model-platforms/100.jina.md`

## Guidelines

- **Use remote (GitHub) only** — fetch catalog and documents from the remote URLs; there is no local mode
- **On fetch failure**, inform the user that docs are temporarily unavailable and suggest retrying or checking network
- **Match descriptions semantically** - don't just look for exact keyword matches
- **Use the Quick Reference section** at the bottom of the catalog for common topics
- **If multiple entries match**, fetch all relevant files to provide comprehensive answers

## URL Reference

### Remote
- **Catalog**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/450.reference/1600.seekdb-docs-catalog.md`
- **Base URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc/V1.0.0/en-US/`
