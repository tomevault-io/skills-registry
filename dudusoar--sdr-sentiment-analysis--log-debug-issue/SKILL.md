# Debug Issue Logging Skill

This skill provides templates and workflows for systematically tracking bugs, errors, and their resolutions using markdown-based logs.

## Quick Start

1. **Create bug log**: Start a new bug log file for your project
2. **Report a bug**: Use the bug report template to document issues
3. **Investigate**: Add investigation notes and findings
4. **Resolve**: Document the fix and root cause
5. **Review**: Maintain a knowledge base of resolved issues

## Core Workflow

### When a Bug is Encountered

1. **Create bug report**:
   - Use the bug report template from `assets/bug-report-template.md`
   - Fill in all relevant sections
   - Include error messages, stack traces, and screenshots if available

2. **Investigate the issue**:
   - Document reproduction steps
   - Add investigation notes as you debug
   - Update status as you progress

3. **Resolve and document**:
   - Record the root cause
   - Document the fix
   - Add testing and verification steps
   - Update status to resolved

4. **Maintain knowledge base**:
   - Keep resolved bugs for future reference
   - Add to troubleshooting guides
   - Share solutions with team

## Bug Report Structure

A complete bug report should include:

- **Basic Info**: ID, title, status, priority, assignee
- **Description**: What happened vs what was expected
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: System, software versions, configuration
- **Investigation**: Debugging process and findings
- **Root Cause**: Analysis of why the issue occurred
- **Fix**: Solution implemented
- **Verification**: How the fix was tested
- **Prevention**: How to prevent similar issues

## Bug Severity Levels

### Critical
- System crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities
- Requires immediate attention
- Blocks core functionality

### High
- Major functionality broken
- Workarounds available but cumbersome
- Affects multiple users

### Medium
- Minor functionality issues
- Cosmetic or UI problems
- Edge cases not working

### Low
- Typos, minor UI inconsistencies
- Enhancement suggestions
- Documentation issues

## Investigation Techniques

### Error Analysis
- Copy complete error messages and stack traces
- Note timestamps and frequency
- Identify patterns in when errors occur

### Reproduction
- Document exact steps to reproduce
- Note any preconditions or specific data needed
- Test on different environments if possible

### Debugging
- Add logging to trace execution flow
- Use debuggers to inspect state
- Check logs and monitoring tools

## Resolution Documentation

### Root Cause Analysis
- Explain why the bug occurred
- Identify underlying issues (not just symptoms)
- Consider design flaws, edge cases, or misunderstandings

### Fix Description
- Document code changes made
- Explain why this fix works
- Note any trade-offs or limitations

### Testing
- Describe how the fix was tested
- Include regression testing
- Document any new test cases added

## Integration with Development

### Version Control
- Link bug reports to commit hashes
- Reference pull request numbers
- Include code snippets in bug reports

### Project Management
- Sync bug status with task boards
- Update stakeholders on critical issues
- Use bug logs for sprint planning

### Team Collaboration
- Assign bugs to appropriate team members
- Add comments and updates
- Share findings in team meetings

## Resources

- **Bug Report Template**: See `assets/bug-report-template.md` for a complete template
- **Bug Examples**: See `references/bug-examples.md` for sample bug reports
- **Debugging Guide**: See `references/debugging-guide.md` for investigation techniques
- **Common Errors**: See `references/common-errors.md` for frequently encountered issues

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Encountering errors or bugs in code
- Debugging complex issues
- Documenting problems for team reference
- Building a knowledge base of solutions
- Analyzing recurring issues
- Preparing bug reports for issue trackers
- Learning from mistakes to prevent future issues
