# Task Board Management Skill

This skill provides tools and templates for managing project tasks using markdown-based task boards.

## Quick Start

1. **Create a new task board**: Use the task board template to start tracking your project
2. **Add tasks**: Use the task template to add individual tasks with details
3. **Update progress**: Mark tasks as pending, in_progress, or completed
4. **Review status**: Generate status reports from the task board

## Core Workflow

### Creating a Task Board

When starting a new project or refactoring:

1. Create a `task-board.md` file in your project root
2. Copy the task board template from `assets/task-board-template.md`
3. Customize the project name, objectives, and initial tasks
4. Use the task template for adding detailed tasks

### Adding and Managing Tasks

For each task:

1. Use the task template format
2. Include essential information:
   - Task description (content)
   - Status (pending/in_progress/completed)
   - Active form description
   - Optional: priority, assignee, due date
3. Update status as work progresses

### Generating Status Reports

To get an overview of project progress:

1. Review the task board markdown file
2. Count tasks by status
3. Identify blockers or overdue tasks
4. Update stakeholders with current status

## Task Board Structure

A task board should include:

- **Project overview**: Name, objectives, timeline
- **Task list**: All tasks with status tracking
- **Progress metrics**: Completed vs total tasks
- **Recent updates**: Change log of task status changes

## Task Template

```markdown
### [Task Number]. [Task Title]

**Status**: `pending` | `in_progress` | `completed`
**Priority**: `high` | `medium` | `low` (optional)
**Assignee**: [Person/Team] (optional)
**Due Date**: YYYY-MM-DD (optional)

**Description**:
[Detailed task description]

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] Subtask 1
- [ ] Subtask 2

**Notes**:
[Additional context or dependencies]

**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
```

## Integration with Claude Code

When working with Claude Code:

1. Use the TodoWrite tool to track real-time task status
2. Sync the task board with the current todo list
3. Update task status when completing work items
4. Document decisions and changes in task notes

## Best Practices

### Task Definition
- Create specific, actionable tasks
- Break complex tasks into smaller subtasks
- Include acceptance criteria when possible
- Assign realistic priorities and due dates

### Status Updates
- Update task status immediately when work begins/completes
- Add notes explaining status changes
- Regularly review and prioritize tasks
- Archive completed tasks periodically

### Collaboration
- Use clear task descriptions for team understanding
- Include relevant context and dependencies
- Document decisions and rationale in task notes
- Share task board updates with stakeholders

## Resources

- **Task Board Template**: See `assets/task-board-template.md` for a complete starting template
- **Task Examples**: See `references/task-examples.md` for sample tasks in different contexts
- **Progress Reporting**: See `references/progress-reporting.md` for status report templates

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Starting a new software project or refactoring
- Managing complex multi-step tasks
- Tracking progress for team projects
- Documenting work for reports or presentations
- Organizing work into manageable chunks
