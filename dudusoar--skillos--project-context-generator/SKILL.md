# Project Context Generator

## Overview

This skill transforms unstructured project requirements into a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file that serves as the central context document for your project. It establishes project boundaries, technical decisions, and conventions that guide all subsequent development work.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Starting a new project and need to establish initial context
- Onboarding Claude to an existing project
- Formalizing requirements and constraints for a project
- Updating project context after significant architectural changes

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Project Information

Ask the user for project details across these key areas:

**Project Basics:**
- Project name and one-sentence description
- Primary goals and success criteria
- Target users or use cases

**Technical Decisions:**
- Programming language(s) and framework(s)
- Database and data storage approach
- Deployment target (cloud, on-premise, edge, etc.)
- Key third-party services or APIs

**Project Constraints:**
- Performance requirements
- Security/compliance requirements
- Budget or resource limitations
- Timeline or milestones

**Development Conventions:**
- File and folder structure
- Naming conventions (files, variables, functions)
- Code style preferences
- Testing approach

**Example questions:**
- "What type of project is this? (web app, CLI tool, data pipeline, mobile app, etc.)"
- "What is the primary technology stack?"
- "Are there specific constraints or requirements? (performance, security, compliance)"
- "Do you have preferences for code organization or naming conventions?"

### Step 2: Generate CLAUDE.md

Use the template in `references/claude_md_template.md` to create a structured CLAUDE.md file. Fill in each section based on the gathered information.

The CLAUDE.md file should be created in the **`.claude/` directory** of the project.

**Template sections:**
1. **Project Overview** - Name, description, goals
2. **Technical Architecture** - Stack, structure, key decisions
3. **Project Constraints** - Requirements, limitations, compliance
4. **Development Conventions** - Naming, organization, style
5. **Available Skills** - (Empty initially, populated by skill-analyzer)
6. **Missing Skills** - (Empty initially, populated by skill-analyzer)

### Step 3: Review and Iterate

Present the generated CLAUDE.md to the user for review. Ask:
- "Does this accurately capture your project requirements?"
- "Are there missing constraints or conventions I should document?"
- "Should any technical decisions be refined?"

Iterate based on feedback until the user approves.

### Step 4: Next Steps

After CLAUDE.md is created, inform the user:
- "✅ CLAUDE.md created at [path]"
- "Next: Run `skill-analyzer` to identify relevant skills for your project"

## Important Notes

### Separation of Concerns

This skill **only** generates the project context portion of CLAUDE.md (sections 1-4).

The Skills sections (5-6) are intentionally left empty and will be populated by the `skill-analyzer` skill.

### Project-Specific vs. General Knowledge

Keep project-specific information in CLAUDE.md. Do not modify general skills with project details. This maintains skill reusability across projects.

### Living Document

CLAUDE.md should evolve with the project. Users can re-run this skill to update context as requirements change.
