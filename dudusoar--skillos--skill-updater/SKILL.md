# Skill Updater

## Overview

This skill evolves skills during project usage by adding references, improving explanations, and documenting discovered patterns—all while respecting each skill's contract. It reads a skill's "Skill Contract" section to understand what can change and what must remain stable.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Discovering a pattern or technique that should be added to a skill
- Finding better ways to explain existing skill concepts
- Encountering edge cases not covered by current skill documentation
- Creating project-specific examples worth preserving
- Identifying confusing areas that need clarification

**Important**: Only use with skills that have a "Skill Contract" section (created by `skill-contract-generator`).

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Update Opportunity

Recognize when a skill could be improved:

**During project work:**
- "This workflow isn't documented in the skill"
- "This edge case should be mentioned"
- "A better example would clarify this"
- "This pattern keeps coming up"

**Ask yourself:**
- Is this improvement general enough for the skill?
- Or is this project-specific (belongs in CLAUDE.md)?

**Rule of thumb:**
- If useful for other projects → update skill
- If project-specific → document in CLAUDE.md or LOG.md

### Step 2: Read Skill Contract

Locate and read the skill's contract:

**Contract location:**
- In the skill's `SKILL.md` file
- Section titled "## Skill Contract"

**What to extract:**
- **Stable elements**: What cannot be changed
- **Mutable elements**: What can evolve
- **Update rules**: What's allowed, what requires review, what's prohibited
- **Knowledge extraction rules**: What to look for

**If no contract exists:**
- Use `skill-contract-generator` to create one first
- Or proceed conservatively (only add references, no SKILL.md changes)

### Step 3: Classify Update Type

Determine what kind of update is needed:

**Type 1: Add Reference File**
- New patterns, workflows, or examples
- Goes in `references/` directory
- Usually allowed without review

**Type 2: Improve SKILL.md**
- Clarify confusing wording
- Add examples to existing sections
- Fix typos or formatting
- Check contract: may need review

**Type 3: Add Script**
- Automation or validation tool
- Goes in `scripts/` directory
- Check contract: often requires review

**Type 4: Optimize Structure**
- Reorganize sections
- Add new sections
- Usually requires review or is prohibited

### Step 4: Verify Against Contract

Check if the update is allowed:

**Allowed without review:**
- Typically: reference files, examples, typos
- Check contract's "Allowed without review" list
- Proceed to Step 5

**Requires review:**
- Typically: SKILL.md structure changes, new sections
- Check contract's "Requires review" list
- Ask user: "This update requires review per the skill contract. Proceed?"
- If yes → Step 5, if no → Stop

**Prohibited:**
- Check contract's "Prohibited" list
- If prohibited: inform user, suggest alternative
- Example: "Contract prohibits changing workflow steps. Consider adding to references/ instead?"

### Step 5: Prepare Update

Create the update content:

**For reference files:**
```markdown
# [Topic Name]

## Context

[Why this reference is needed]

## Pattern/Workflow/Example

[Detailed content]

## Usage

When to use this pattern:
- [Scenario 1]
- [Scenario 2]

## Related

- Main skill: [section references]
- Other skills: [if applicable]
```

**For SKILL.md updates:**
- Read current content around update point
- Draft new content that matches existing style
- Preserve formatting and structure
- Keep additions concise

**For scripts:**
- Follow SkillOS code style (see CLAUDE.md)
- Add docstrings
- Test before adding

### Step 6: Apply Update

Execute the update:

**Adding reference file:**
```
1. Create file in references/ with descriptive name
2. Add entry to SKILL.md "Resources" section (if exists)
3. Use clear filename: references/[topic]-[type].md
```

**Updating SKILL.md:**
```
1. Read current SKILL.md
2. Find insertion point
3. Insert new content
4. Preserve existing formatting
5. Write updated SKILL.md
```

**Adding script:**
```
1. Create script in scripts/ directory
2. Add to Resources section
3. Document usage in SKILL.md
```

### Step 7: Document the Update

Record what changed and why:

**Update LOG.md:**
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

### [REFACTOR] Updated [skill-name] skill

**Context:** [Why this update was needed]

**What Changed:**
- Added `references/[filename].md` documenting [topic]
- [OR] Clarified [section] in SKILL.md
- [OR] Added `scripts/[filename].py` for [purpose]

**Impact:**
- Skill now covers [new scenario]
- Better guidance for [use case]

**Contract compliance:**
- Update type: [allowed without review / reviewed and approved]
- Contract section: [which part of contract allowed this]

**Related:**
- Project: [current project name]
- Skill: `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/`
```

**Optionally update skill's contract:**
- If update reveals new patterns for extraction
- If boundaries should be refined
- Use `skill-contract-generator` to update

### Step 8: Verify and Commit

Ensure update maintains skill quality:

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Contract rules followed
- [ ] Existing content preserved
- [ ] Formatting consistent
- [ ] New content is general (not project-specific)
- [ ] References are clear and useful
- [ ] No broken links or references

**Test if possible:**
- For scripts: run and verify output
- For workflow changes: walk through mentally
- For examples: check they're correct

**Commit:**
- Use git to commit skill update
- Reference in commit message: which skill, why updated

## Update Patterns

### Pattern 1: Adding Project Workflow

**Scenario:** Discovered project-specific workflow that uses the skill

**Action:**
```
1. Create references/[project-type]-workflow.md
2. Document the workflow
3. Add pointer from main SKILL.md if generally useful
```

**Example:** Adding `references/monorepo-git-workflow.md` to `git-workflow` skill

### Pattern 2: Clarifying Confusion

**Scenario:** User confused by existing explanation

**Action:**
```
1. Identify confusing section
2. Add example or clarification
3. Test with fresh perspective
```

**Example:** Adding example to `project-logger` for complex log entries

### Pattern 3: Edge Case Documentation

**Scenario:** Encountered edge case not covered

**Action:**
```
1. Add to existing section if short
2. Or create references/edge-cases.md if many
3. Include workaround or solution
```

**Example:** Adding conflict resolution edge case to `git-workflow`

### Pattern 4: Template Enhancement

**Scenario:** Template missing useful section

**Action:**
```
1. Check contract: template changes often need review
2. If allowed: add section with [OPTIONAL] marker
3. Update template documentation
```

**Example:** Adding optional security section to CLAUDE.md template

## Important Notes

### Respect Skill Contracts

- Contracts exist to preserve skill identity
- Breaking contracts fragments knowledge
- When in doubt, add to references/ not SKILL.md

### General vs. Project-Specific

**Add to skill if:**
- Useful across multiple projects
- Generalizable pattern
- No project-specific details

**Keep in project if:**
- Specific to this codebase
- One-off solution
- Tied to project context

**Decision heuristic:**
- Would 3+ other projects benefit? → Skill
- Unique to this project? → CLAUDE.md or LOG.md

### When to Create New Skill vs. Update

**Update existing skill when:**
- Natural extension of current scope
- Fills gap in existing coverage
- Same domain and user base

**Create new skill when:**
- Different domain or use case
- Would make existing skill too complex
- Distinct workflow or purpose

### Accumulating Knowledge

Updates should accumulate wisdom:
- Each update adds value
- Preserve historical examples (don't replace)
- Build comprehensive coverage over time

## Resources

This skill operates by reading and modifying other skills' files. It doesn't require its own references or scripts, but relies on:
- Skill contracts (created by `skill-contract-generator`)
- Project LOG.md (to document updates)
- Git (to version control changes)

## Skill Contract

**Stable:** 8-step workflow, contract compliance checking, safety verifications
**Mutable:** Update patterns, decision heuristics, examples, edge case documentation
**Update rules:** See `references/contract.md` for detailed rules
