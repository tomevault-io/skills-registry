# Documentation Skill

## Purpose
Provide templates, standards, and methodology for creating and maintaining
high-quality software documentation that developers actually read and use.

## Documentation Types Reference

| Type | When | Where | Template |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| Module README | New module created | `module/README.md` | See below |
| API Reference | Public API changes | Docstrings in source | See below |
| ADR | Architecture decision | `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md` | [adr.md.tmpl](templates/adr.md.tmpl) |
| Changelog | Every PR/change | `CHANGELOG.md` (root) | [changelog-entry.md.tmpl](templates/changelog-entry.md.tmpl) |
| API Doc | New/changed endpoints | `docs/api/` | [api-doc.md.tmpl](templates/api-doc.md.tmpl) |
| Runbook | Operational procedure | `docs/runbooks/` | Freeform |
| Getting Started | New project or major change | Root `README.md` | See below |

## README Structure Standard

Every README should follow this structure (omit irrelevant sections):

```markdown
# Project/Module Name

One-sentence summary of what this does and why it exists.

## Quick Start

Minimal example to get from zero to working in < 2 minutes.

## Installation

Prerequisites, dependencies, and setup steps.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
Most common use case with a working code example.

### Advanced Usage
Less common patterns, configuration options.

## API Reference

Key functions/classes with signatures (or link to generated docs).

## Architecture

Brief description of how this is structured and why.
Link to ADRs for significant decisions.

## Configuration

Environment variables, config files, and their options.

## Development

How to set up for development, run tests, and contribute.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions.
```

## Docstring Standards

### Python (Google Style)
```python
def transfer_funds(
    source: Account,
    target: Account,
    amount: Decimal,
    currency: str = "USD",
) -> TransferResult:
    """Transfer funds between two accounts.

    Validates sufficient balance, converts currency if needed, and
    executes the transfer atomically. Emits a TransferCompleted event
    on success.

    Args:
        source: The account to debit.
        target: The account to credit.
        amount: Transfer amount. Must be positive.
        currency: ISO 4217 currency code. Defaults to "USD".

    Returns:
        TransferResult containing transaction ID and final balances.

    Raises:
        InsufficientFundsError: If source balance < amount.
        CurrencyConversionError: If conversion rate unavailable.
        AccountFrozenError: If either account is frozen.

    Example:
        >>> result = transfer_funds(checking, savings, Decimal("500"))
        >>> print(result.transaction_id)
        'txn_abc123'

    Note:
        This operation is idempotent — retrying with the same
        idempotency key will return the original result.
    """
```

### TypeScript (TSDoc)
```typescript
/**
 * Transfer funds between two accounts.
 *
 * Validates sufficient balance, converts currency if needed, and
 * executes the transfer atomically.
 *
 * @param source - The account to debit
 * @param target - The account to credit
 * @param amount - Transfer amount (must be positive)
 * @param options - Optional transfer configuration
 * @returns Promise resolving to TransferResult with transaction ID
 * @throws {InsufficientFundsError} If source balance < amount
 * @throws {AccountFrozenError} If either account is frozen
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const result = await transferFunds(checking, savings, 500);
 * console.log(result.transactionId); // 'txn_abc123'
 * ```
 */
```

### C++ (Doxygen)
```cpp
/**
 * @brief Transfer funds between two accounts.
 *
 * Validates sufficient balance, converts currency if needed,
 * and executes the transfer atomically.
 *
 * @param source The account to debit
 * @param target The account to credit
 * @param amount Transfer amount (must be positive)
 * @return TransferResult containing transaction ID
 * @throws InsufficientFundsError if source balance < amount
 *
 * @code
 * auto result = transfer_funds(checking, savings, 500.0);
 * std::cout << result.transaction_id << std::endl;
 * @endcode
 */
```

## Changelog Standard (Keep a Changelog)

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New features that have been added

### Changed
- Changes in existing functionality

### Deprecated
- Features that will be removed in future versions

### Removed
- Features that have been removed

### Fixed
- Bug fixes

### Security
- Vulnerability fixes
```

Categories in order: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security.

## Documentation Coverage Check

Use the script in `scripts/doc_coverage.sh` to check:
- Public functions/methods without docstrings
- Modules without README files
- Missing changelog entries
- Stale docs (modified code but unchanged docs)

## Templates

See the `templates/` directory for ready-to-use templates:
- [adr.md.tmpl](templates/adr.md.tmpl) — Architecture Decision Record
- [api-doc.md.tmpl](templates/api-doc.md.tmpl) — API endpoint documentation
- [changelog-entry.md.tmpl](templates/changelog-entry.md.tmpl) — Changelog entry
