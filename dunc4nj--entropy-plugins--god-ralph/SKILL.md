# god-ralph Skill

god-ralph is an autonomous development system that combines two powerful patterns:

1. **Ralph Wiggum**: Ephemeral, iterative agents that work until completion
2. **Beads**: Granular, dependency-tracked work items

## When to Use god-ralph

Use god-ralph when:
- You have multiple beads ready to work on
- You want autonomous execution without babysitting
- You need parallel development on independent tasks
- You want verification after each completion
- You need persistent progress tracking

## Core Concepts

### Ephemeral Ralphs
Each Ralph worker:
- Completes exactly ONE bead
- Iterates until acceptance criteria met (or max iterations)
- Dies after completion
- Works in isolated git worktree

### Orchestrator
Persistent agent that:
- Finds ready beads via `bd ready`
- Analyzes parallelism opportunities
- Spawns and monitors Ralphs
- Merges completed work
- Runs verification
- Creates fix-beads on failure

### Verification Ralph
After each merge:
- Runs all acceptance criteria
- Checks for integration issues
- Creates high-priority fix-beads on failure

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/god-ralph start` | Start autonomous execution (dry-run first) |
| `/god-ralph plan` | Interactive wizard to create beads |
| `/god-ralph status` | Show current progress |
| `/god-ralph stop` | Gracefully stop execution |
| `/god-ralph <id>` | Run Ralph on specific bead |

## Bead Specification

For god-ralph to work effectively, beads should include:

```yaml
title: "Clear, actionable title"
description: "Detailed description"
type: feature|task|bug
priority: 0-4

# In comments until schema supports:
ralph_spec:
  completion_promise: "BEAD COMPLETE"
  max_iterations: 50
  acceptance_criteria:
    - type: test
      command: "npm test"
    - type: lint
      command: "npm run lint"
```

## Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Plan your work
/god-ralph plan
# Wizard asks questions, creates beads

# 2. Review what's ready
bd ready

# 3. Start autonomous execution
/god-ralph start
# Shows dry-run plan, asks for confirmation

# 4. Monitor progress
/god-ralph status

# 5. Stop when needed
/god-ralph stop
```

## Parallelism

god-ralph automatically parallelizes independent beads:

```
Group 1 (parallel):
  - beads-abc: "Add API endpoint" → worktree/1
  - beads-def: "Add frontend page" → worktree/2

Group 2 (after Group 1):
  - beads-ghi: "Integration tests" → worktree/3
```

Beads with file overlap run sequentially.

## Git Isolation

Each Ralph works in a separate git worktree:

```
Main repo:     /project/           → main
Worktree 1:    .worktrees/ralph-1/ → ralph/beads-abc
Worktree 2:    .worktrees/ralph-2/ → ralph/beads-def
```

This allows:
- Parallel file editing
- Independent commits
- Clean merges

## Cost Awareness

Typical costs:
- Simple bead (3-5 iterations): $1-2
- Medium bead (10-15 iterations): $3-5
- Complex bead (30+ iterations): $10-15

`/god-ralph status` shows running cost estimate.

## Error Handling

When things go wrong:

1. **Ralph fails (max iterations)**
   - Bead marked as blocked
   - Diagnostic comment added
   - Orchestrator continues to next bead

2. **Merge conflict**
   - Merge aborted
   - Fix-bead created (priority 0)
   - Original bead marked blocked

3. **Verification fails**
   - Fix-bead created with failure details
   - Linked to failed beads
   - Orchestrator continues

## Integration with Beads

god-ralph extends the beads ecosystem:

```bash
# Create beads normally
bd create --title="..." --type=feature

# Add ralph_spec via comments
bd comments <id> --add "ralph_spec: ..."

# god-ralph uses bd CLI under the hood
bd ready      # Find work
bd update     # Claim work
bd close      # Complete work
bd dep        # Manage dependencies
```

## Best Practices

1. **Right-size beads**: 5-15 iterations each
2. **Clear acceptance criteria**: Specific, runnable tests
3. **Explicit dependencies**: Link related beads
4. **Monitor progress**: Check `/god-ralph status` periodically
5. **Review fix-beads**: Address failures before continuing
