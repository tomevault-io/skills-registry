# Source-Only Enforcer

## Core Responsibility

Ensure ALL medical study guides are created from source material only, with mandatory pre-creation verification.

**NO external medical facts** - Only information from source file (exception: researched mnemonics via WebSearch).

**Works for ALL medical specialties**: Pharmacology, pathophysiology, clinical medicine, physical examination, procedures.

## When This Activates

**Prompt triggers:**
- "create drug chart" (Excel or HTML)
- "create learning objectives guide" (HTML)
- "create clinical assessment guide" (HTML)
- "make study guide from lecture"
- "generate word/excel/html study guide"
- "/drugs-3-tab-excel [source-file]"
- "/LO-word [source-file]"
- "/drugs-html [source-file]"
- "/LO-html [source-file]"
- "/clinical-assessment-html [source-file]"

**File triggers:**
- Working with files in `Claude Study Tools/` directory
- Files ending in `.xlsx`, `.docx`, `.html`

## Pre-Creation Verification Checklist

Before creating ANY study guide, you MUST state:

```
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
☐ Source file: [exact path to source file]
☐ Instruction template: [Drug Chart HTML / Excel Drug Chart / HTML LO / Clinical Assessment / Word LO]
☐ Source-only policy: I will ONLY use information from source file
☐ Learning objectives: I will extract LO statements EXACTLY as written (NO paraphrasing)
☐ Exception: Memory tricks/mnemonics WILL be researched via WebSearch
☐ MANDATORY: I will WebSearch for mnemonics/analogies - I will NOT invent them
☐ Save location: [Class]/[Exam]/Claude Study Tools/
```

## Required Actions

1. **Read ENTIRE source file first** - No skipping or partial reads
2. **Read COMPLETE template file** - Understand all formatting requirements
3. **STATE the verification checklist** - Must be explicitly stated
4. **Create verification marker:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/study-guide-cache/${session_id}"
   echo '{"verified":true,"timestamp":"'$(date -Iseconds)'"}' > \
     "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/study-guide-cache/${session_id}/verification.json"
   ```
5. **ONLY THEN proceed with creation**

## Enforcement

This skill works with the `verification-guard.sh` hook:
- Hook BLOCKS file writes without verification marker
- You must create the verification marker before proceeding
- Session-aware: First study guide blocks, subsequent ones in same session allowed

## What Gets BLOCKED

❌ Creating study guides without stating verification checklist
❌ Adding external medical facts not in source file
❌ Inventing mnemonics without WebSearch research
❌ Skipping template file review
❌ Not specifying exact source file path
❌ **Paraphrasing learning objective statements**

## What's ALLOWED

✅ Information from source file only
✅ Researched mnemonics via WebSearch (must cite source)
✅ External additions marked with asterisk (*) if absolutely necessary
✅ Page references from source file
✅ Paraphrasing of answers/explanations (same meaning from source)
✅ Formatting changes to content (bullets, tables, etc.)

## Learning Objective Verbatim Requirement

<verbatim-requirement>
CRITICAL: Learning objective STATEMENTS must be copied EXACTLY as written in the source.
- Copy word-for-word, character-for-character
- Do NOT rephrase, summarize, or "improve" wording
- Preserve original numbering and sequence
- If an LO is long, still copy it completely
</verbatim-requirement>

**This applies to:** The LO statement text itself (e.g., "Describe the mechanism of action of beta-blockers")

**This does NOT apply to:** Answers, explanations, or content that responds to the LO (these can be paraphrased from source)

**Example - CORRECT:**
```
Source: "1. Describe the mechanism of action of beta-blockers"
Guide:  "1. Describe the mechanism of action of beta-blockers"
```

**Example - INCORRECT:**
```
Source: "1. Describe the mechanism of action of beta-blockers"
Guide:  "1. Explain how beta-blockers work"  ← WRONG: Paraphrased
```

## Emergency Override

If hooks malfunction:
```bash
export SKIP_STUDY_GUIDE_VERIFICATION=1
# Your study guide creation command
unset SKIP_STUDY_GUIDE_VERIFICATION
```

## Post-Creation

After creating study guide, you'll automatically see a post-verification reminder. Complete all 4 checks:

1. ✓ Source Accuracy
2. ✓ Template Compliance
3. ✓ Completeness
4. ✓ Quality Checks

Then state: "Post-creation verification complete"

## Common Failures

**If hook blocks your creation:**

**Reason:** Verification marker not present
**Solution:**
1. Read entire source file first
2. State verification checklist
3. Create verification marker (command shown above)
4. THEN proceed with file creation

**Reason:** Trying to add external medical facts
**Solution:**
- Use ONLY source file information
- For mnemonics: WebSearch for established mnemonics, cite source
- Mark any external additions with asterisk (*)

## Tips

💡 Use slash commands for automatic verification:
- `/drugs-3-tab-excel [source-file]` - Automatically handles verification
- `/LO-word [source-file]` - Automatically handles verification
- `/verify-accuracy [file] [source]` - Deep accuracy check

💡 Session-aware: Once verified this session, create multiple study guides without repeated blocking

💡 Source-only policy protects you from inaccurate study materials
