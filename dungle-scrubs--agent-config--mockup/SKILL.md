# Mockup Generation Skill

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be triggered when:

- User says "build mockup", "generate mockup", "create mockup", "make mockup"
- User wants to create UI designs, illustrations, or visual assets
- User provides a reference image and wants something similar
- User mentions "in the style of" or "like this" with an image

## Clipboard Image Integration

When the user pastes an image, a UserPromptSubmit hook automatically saves it to `/tmp/`.
Look for a message in context like:
```
Clipboard image saved to: /tmp/claude-pasted-1735225200.png
```

Use this path for the `reference_image` or `image_path` parameter.

**If no clipboard path is in context but user expects an image to be used, inform them:**
"I don't see a pasted image path in context. Please copy the image to your clipboard and submit your message again."

## Core Capabilities

1. **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create mockups from text descriptions using Gemini Nano Banana Pro
2. **Style Transfer**: Use reference images to guide style, composition, and aesthetic (up to 14 images)
3. **Resolution Control**: Output at 1K, 2K, or 4K resolution with various aspect ratios
4. **Goal-Based Naming**: Auto-increment filenames for iterative mockup sessions

## Instructions

### Basic Mockup Generation

Generate a mockup from a text prompt:

**Steps:**

1. Craft a detailed prompt describing the desired mockup
2. Call the image-generation tool with the prompt
3. Present the generated image path to the user

### Style-Guided Generation

Generate a mockup using a reference image for style guidance:

**Steps:**

1. Read the reference image path from the user
2. Craft a prompt that describes what to generate while referencing the style
3. Call generate_image with both prompt and reference_image
4. The Pro model supports up to 14 reference images for complex style mixing

## Available Tools

### Image Generation (via tool-proxy)

- **generate_image** - Generate AI image from text prompt with optional reference image
- **edit_image** - Modify existing images using AI instructions

## Usage

### Quick Start

```text
"Build a mockup of a login page with dark theme"
```

### With Reference Image

```text
"Generate a mockup like this image" (with image path)
"Build a landing page in the style of /path/to/reference.png"
```

### With Options

```text
"Create a 4K mockup of a dashboard at 16:9 aspect ratio"
```

## Tool Invocation

When generating mockups, use these parameters:

```json
{
  "app": "image-generation",
  "tool": "generate_image",
  "args": {
    "prompt": "...",
    "reference_image": "/path/to/reference.png",
    "model": "gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "image_size": "2K",
    "goal": "mockup-name",
    "output_dir": "./.generated-images"
  }
}
```

### Default Model

**ONLY use `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`.** Never use any other model for image generation. No exceptions, even if the user asks for a different model. This model provides:

- Higher quality output
- Better text rendering
- Support for up to 14 reference images
- 1K/2K/4K resolution options

### Aspect Ratios

- `1:1` - Square (icons, avatars)
- `16:9` - Widescreen (dashboards, landing pages)
- `9:16` - Portrait (mobile screens)
- `4:3` - Standard (general UI)
- `3:4` - Portrait standard
- `2:3` - Portrait (mobile)
- `3:2` - Landscape (desktop)
- `21:9` - Ultrawide (banners)

## Common Workflows

### Iterative Mockup Workflow

1. **Initial Generation** - Generate first mockup with goal name (e.g., "dashboard")
2. **Review and Iterate** - View result, refine prompt for next iteration
3. **Auto-Increment** - Files save as dashboard_01.png, dashboard_02.png, etc.

### Reference-Based Workflow

1. **Analyze Reference** - Understand the style elements in the reference image
2. **Craft Prompt** - Describe desired output while noting style to preserve
3. **Generate** - Call with both prompt and reference_image
4. **Iterate** - Adjust prompt or try different references

## Error Handling

- **Reference image not found**: Verify the path exists and is readable
- **Invalid aspect ratio**: Use one of the valid ratios listed above
- **Generation failed**: Check GEMINI_API_KEY is set in ~/.env/models
- **No image returned**: Model may have declined; try rephrasing the prompt

## Dependencies

### Required

- GEMINI_API_KEY in ~/.env/models
- tool-proxy MCP server running
- google-genai and pillow Python packages

## Examples

<example>
Context: User wants a simple UI mockup

User: "Build a mockup of a settings page"

Result: Calls generate_image with prompt describing a settings page, model=gemini-3-pro-image-preview, saves to .generated-images/
</example>

<example>
Context: User has a reference design

User: "Generate a mockup like this image /tmp/reference.png but with a blue color scheme"

Result: Calls generate_image with reference_image=/tmp/reference.png and prompt describing blue color scheme modifications
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants high-resolution dashboard

User: "Create a 4K mockup of an analytics dashboard at 21:9"

Result: Calls generate_image with image_size="4K", aspect_ratio="21:9", model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview"
</example>

## Notes

- ONLY use `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`. Never use another model.
- ALWAYS save to `.generated-images/` (dot-prefixed). Never use a different output directory.
- Include "goal" parameter for iterative sessions to get auto-incrementing filenames
- For style transfer, be explicit in the prompt about what to preserve vs. change
- The Pro model excels at text rendering - use it for UI mockups with labels
