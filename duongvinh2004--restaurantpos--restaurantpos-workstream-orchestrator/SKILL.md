description: Plan and split RestaurantPOS hardening into safe, reviewable Codex workstreams with minimal shared-file collisions. Use when Codex needs to break a large request into parallel or sequential batches, assign scope boundaries, protect shared files, pick verification depth, or produce batch reports that follow the repo's AGENTS.md. Use when this capability is needed.

# RestaurantPOS Workstream Orchestrator

Read `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/AGENTS.md`, and `references/paths.md` before planning or executing a large batch.

## Workflow

1. Classify the request against the repo priority order before writing code.
2. Split the work into narrow, reviewable batches that own a small file set and a clear test surface.
3. Treat `routes/api.php`, `config/booking.php`, `config/staff_capabilities.php`, and `database/schema/mysql-schema.sql` as shared seams that need extra coordination.
4. Prefer service-layer implementation batches first, then schema or integration sync, then a final pass for seams and regressions.
5. End each batch with the required report shape: Intent, Changed files, Added or updated tests, Remaining risks.

## Guardrails

- Avoid broad refactors and speculative cleanup during orchestration.
- Defer large shared-file collisions to a later integration or schema-sync batch when possible.
- Keep bootstrap, API contract, and operational gate changes visible instead of burying them inside domain batches.
- If there is no Git metadata available, still maintain strict batch boundaries and explicit ownership.

## Verify

- Run targeted tests per batch, not only one full-suite pass at the end.
- Use `docs/codex-parallel-agent-prompts.md` as the default decomposition map for large hardening asks.
- Run an integration-focused test slice after shared seams are touched.
