description: GitHub CLI operations for issues, PRs, reviews, CI, and Copilot workflows. Use when working with pull requests, issues, CI status, code review, GitHub Copilot, triage, or PR shipping. Use when this capability is needed.

<objective>
Unified interface for GitHub operations using `gh` CLI. Provides patterns for common GitHub workflows including issue triage, PR review, CI monitoring, and Copilot iteration tracking.
</objective>

<quick_start>
For simple queries, use `gh` directly. See [cli-patterns.md](references/cli-patterns.md).

```bash
gh pr list                    # List open PRs
gh issue list                 # List open issues
gh pr view 42                 # View PR #42
gh pr checks 42               # Check CI status
```

</quick_start>

<scripts>
Bundled scripts for data gathering (output JSON, run without loading into context).

Script paths are **relative to this SKILL.md file** (not the working directory).
Derive the absolute script path from this file's location:

- If this SKILL.md is at `/path/to/github/SKILL.md`
- Then scripts are at `/path/to/github/scripts/`

Available scripts:

- `scripts/triage_gather.sh` - Parallel PR/issue collection
- `scripts/pr_details.sh <number>` - PR info + diff + checks
- `scripts/copilot_activity.sh` - Copilot activity summary
</scripts>

<workflows>
- **Ship PR**: Branch → `/commit` → version bump → PR → Copilot review. See [pr-workflow.md](references/pr-workflow.md)
- **Triage**: See [triage-workflow.md](references/triage-workflow.md)
- **PR Review**: Run `scripts/pr_details.sh`, apply [review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md)
- **Copilot Status**: Run `scripts/copilot_activity.sh`
</workflows>

</reference_guides>

<actions>
**Auto-execute (no confirmation):** Post comments, request changes, add labels

**Require confirmation:** merge, approve, close
</actions>

<tips>
- Use `--json` + `--jq` for scripting (more stable than text)
- Include `--limit` for large result sets
- For CI status, check `gh run list --branch` for latest (PR status can be stale)
- Copilot author format varies by repo (check with `gh pr list --state all --json author`)
</tips>

<success_criteria>
GitHub operations are successful when:

- Commands execute without authentication errors
- Data is retrieved in expected format (JSON for scripts, text for quick queries)
- PR/issue state changes are reflected in GitHub UI
- CI status accurately reflects latest workflow runs
</success_criteria>
