## GTD Core Workflow

1. **Capture** - Get it out of your head into the system
2. **Clarify** - Is it actionable? What's the next action?
3. **Organize** - Add context, energy, status, horizon labels
4. **Reflect** - Daily/weekly/quarterly/yearly reviews keep system trusted
5. **Engage** - Work from filtered lists, not full backlog

## Running the CLI

All GTD operations go through the `gtd` CLI.

The `gtd` script is at `scripts/gtd` **relative to this SKILL.md file** (not the working directory).
Derive the absolute script path from this file's location:

- If this SKILL.md is at `/path/to/gtd/SKILL.md`
- Then the CLI is at `/path/to/gtd/scripts/gtd`

```bash
# Derive path from SKILL.md location, then run:
scripts/gtd <command>
```

**Setup is automatic**: The CLI will detect if labels are missing and create them on first use.

## Label Taxonomy (12 Fixed Labels)

Never create new labels. See [label-taxonomy.md](references/label-taxonomy.md).

- **Context**: focus, meetings, async, offsite (where/when)
- **Energy**: high, low (cognitive load)
- **Status**: active, waiting, someday (workflow state)
- **Horizon**: action, project, goal (GTD altitude)

## GTD Horizons of Focus

The system supports David Allen's 6 Horizons:

| Horizon | Name | Implementation |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Ground | Actions | `horizon/action` label via gtd CLI |
| H1 | Projects | `horizon/project` label + project grouping |
| H2 | Areas of Focus | Ongoing responsibilities without end dates |
| H3 | Goals | `horizon/goal` label via gtd CLI |
| H4 | Vision | `HORIZONS.md` at vault root |
| H5 | Purpose | `HORIZONS.md` at vault root |

**Setup:** Copy the template to your vault root:

```bash
cp references/horizons.md HORIZONS.md  # path relative to this SKILL.md
```

<intake>
What would you like to do?

1. Capture something new
2. Process inbox (clarify items)
3. Find tasks to work on
4. Do a review (daily/weekly/quarterly/yearly)
5. Manage projects

**Wait for response before proceeding.**
</intake>

<routing>

| Response | Command |
|----------|---------|
| 1, "capture", "add something" | `scripts/gtd capture "<text>"` |
| 2, "inbox", "process", "clarify" | `scripts/gtd inbox` then `scripts/gtd clarify <id>` |
| 3, "list", "find", "work", "tasks" | `scripts/gtd list --status active --context <context>` |
| 4a, "daily review" | `scripts/gtd daily` |
| 4b, "weekly review" | `scripts/gtd weekly` |
| 4c, "quarterly review" | `scripts/gtd quarterly` |
| 4d, "yearly review" | `scripts/gtd yearly` |
| 4e, "review status", "when did I" | `scripts/gtd reviews` |
| 5, "projects" | `scripts/gtd projects` or `scripts/gtd project list` |
| 5a, "create project" | `scripts/gtd project create "<title>"` |
| 5b, "show project", "project details" | `scripts/gtd project show "<title>"` |
| 5c, "delete project" | `scripts/gtd project delete "<title>"` |

**After determining intent, execute commands using `scripts/gtd` (path relative to this SKILL.md).**
