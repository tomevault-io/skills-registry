# Meeting Notes Sync

Sync and manage meeting transcripts from Google Calendar and Gemini email notes using the meeting_notes automation tool.

**Script location:** `scripts/meeting_notes` **relative to this SKILL.md file** (not the working directory).
Derive the absolute script path from this file's location:

- If this SKILL.md is at `/path/to/meeting-notes/SKILL.md`
- Then the script is at `/path/to/meeting-notes/scripts/meeting_notes`

**⚠️ INTERACTIVE SKILL:** This skill requires user approval at each step. Never auto-execute `decide` or `download` commands without explicit user confirmation.

## AI Agent Usage

**IMPORTANT: When calling this script from an AI agent context:**

- **Always use the `--json` flag** for machine-readable output
- **Flag order matters:** `--json` is a global flag and MUST come BEFORE the command
- JSON output includes structured data with `next_steps`, `decision_table`, and `pending_decisions`
- Parse JSON to determine workflow state and present information to users
- When proposing meeting classifications:
  - Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool (never just text)
  - Make intelligent groupings and proposals based on meeting patterns
  - Group meetings by detected patterns (e.g., "All 1:1s → one-on-ones,r", "Team meetings → team,r")
  - Highlight anomalies or meetings that need special attention
  - Provide clear, actionable options with descriptions of what each choice does

**Example AI workflow:**

```bash
# CORRECT: --json before command
scripts/meeting_notes --json status
scripts/meeting_notes --json decide
scripts/meeting_notes --json download

# INCORRECT: --json after command
scripts/meeting_notes status --json  # ❌ Won't work!

# Complete workflow:
# 1. Get status as JSON
scripts/meeting_notes --json status

# 2. Parse JSON to check pending_decisions_count
# 3. If pending, use decision_table to analyze patterns
# 4. Use AskUserQuestion to present grouped proposals
# 5. Execute decisions based on user choice
scripts/meeting_notes decide --accept-all  # Execute (no need for --json on actions)

# 6. Verify completion
scripts/meeting_notes --json status
```

## Purpose

This skill automates the process of discovering calendar meetings, matching them with Gemini-generated transcripts and summaries, and organizing everything into a structured directory hierarchy within the pensieve repository.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Syncing meeting notes since the last sync
- Checking for new Gemini transcripts
- Organizing meeting transcripts and summaries
- Setting up recurring vs one-off meeting classifications
- Managing tag definitions (creating, editing, renaming tags)

## How It Works

The meeting notes sync runs a three-phase workflow:

### Phase 1: Sync (Discovery + Matching)

Discover calendar events and match with Gemini emails in a single step.

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes sync
```

This command:

- Fetches calendar events since the last sync
- Searches for corresponding Gemini transcript/summary emails
- Matches bidirectionally (calendar → emails and orphaned emails → meetings)
- Generates slugs for new meetings
- Suggests recurring/one-off classification and tags
- Outputs a decision table showing meetings that need classification

### Phase 2: Decide (Classification)

Apply recurring and tag decisions to meetings.

**Accept all suggestions:**

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes decide --accept-all
```

**Override specific meetings, then accept the rest (recommended for small changes):**

```bash
# Step 1: Override only the meetings you disagree with
scripts/meeting_notes decide 7=rhdh,r 13=one-on-ones,r

# Step 2: Accept all remaining suggestions
scripts/meeting_notes decide --accept-all
```

This two-step approach is ideal when you want to change only a few meetings out of many. The first `decide` overrides specific meetings, and the second `decide --accept-all` applies suggestions to all meetings that haven't been decided yet.

**Inline syntax (for complete manual control):**

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes decide 1=rhdh,r 2=team,o 3=one-on-ones,r
```

Format: `[number]=[tag],[r|o]`

- `r` = recurring
- `o` = one-off

**Grouped syntax:**

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes decide --tag 1=rhdh,2=team --recurring 1,3 --one-off 2
```

This command:

- Classifies meetings as recurring or one-off
- Assigns tags for organization (rhdh, one-on-ones, team, planning, etc.)
- Generates directory paths based on classification
- Saves recurring patterns to state for future syncs
- Can be run multiple times - each run updates only the specified meetings

### Phase 3: Download (Asset Retrieval)

Download transcripts, summaries, and attachments.

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes download
```

This command:

- Downloads Gemini transcripts and summaries
- Downloads calendar attachments
- Follows links in documents to download referenced materials
- Creates README.md with meeting metadata and summary
- Generates metadata.json for programmatic access

## Directory Structure

Meetings are organized by tag and type:

**Recurring meetings:**

```
meetings/{tag}/{slug}/{date}/
  ├── README.md
  ├── metadata.json
  ├── gemini-transcript.md
  └── gemini-summary.md
```

**One-off meetings:**

```
meetings/{tag}/{date}-{slug}/
  ├── README.md
  ├── metadata.json
  ├── gemini-transcript.md
  └── gemini-summary.md
```

**Common tags:**

- `rhdh` - Red Hat Developer Hub related meetings
- `one-on-ones` - 1:1 meetings
- `team` - Team meetings, standups, syncs
- `planning` - Planning and strategy sessions
- `uncategorized` - Meetings without a specific tag

## Browsing Meetings

Use the `list` and `show` commands to explore synced meetings.

### List Meetings

```bash
# List all meetings (newest first)
scripts/meeting_notes list

# Filter by tag
scripts/meeting_notes list --tag rhdh
scripts/meeting_notes list --tag one-on-ones

# Filter by type
scripts/meeting_notes list --recurring        # recurring only
scripts/meeting_notes list --one-off          # one-off only

# Filter by time range
scripts/meeting_notes list --since 2025-01-01
scripts/meeting_notes list --until 2025-01-31
scripts/meeting_notes list --since 2025-01-01 --until 2025-01-31

# Filter by status
scripts/meeting_notes list --status synced    # fully processed
scripts/meeting_notes list --status discovered  # pending classification

# Filter by Gemini availability
scripts/meeting_notes list --has-gemini       # with transcripts
scripts/meeting_notes list --no-gemini        # missing transcripts

# Filter by special flags
scripts/meeting_notes list --orphaned         # Gemini without calendar events
scripts/meeting_notes list --one-on-ones      # 1:1 meetings only

# Combine filters and limit results
scripts/meeting_notes list --tag rhdh --recurring --since 2025-01-01 --limit 10

# Sort options
scripts/meeting_notes list --sort title       # alphabetical
scripts/meeting_notes list --oldest           # oldest first (default: newest)
```

**Output format:**

```
Meetings
==========================================================================================
DATE         TAG             R   G   TITLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2025-01-10   rhdh            r   ✓   RHDH Standup
2025-01-09   one-on-ones     r   ✓   1:1 with Alice
2025-01-08   team            o   -   Planning Session

Total: 3 meeting(s)
```

### Show Meeting Details

```bash
# View full details for a specific meeting
scripts/meeting_notes show <stable_id>
scripts/meeting_notes show rhdh-standup-2025-01-10
```

Shows:

- Core info (date, time, tag, status, directory)
- Flags (one-on-one, orphaned, manual capture needed)
- Gemini asset URLs (transcript, summary)
- Calendar metadata (attendees, organizer, location, attachments)

**AI Agent workflow for browsing:**

```bash
# 1. Get list as JSON
scripts/meeting_notes --json list --tag rhdh --limit 10

# 2. Parse JSON to display to user
# 3. User selects a meeting
# 4. Get details as JSON
scripts/meeting_notes --json show <stable_id>
```

### Edit Meeting Metadata

Modify tag, recurring flag, or slug for existing meetings:

```bash
# Change tag
scripts/meeting_notes edit <stable_id> --tag team

# Change recurring/one-off
scripts/meeting_notes edit <stable_id> --recurring
scripts/meeting_notes edit <stable_id> --one-off

# Change slug
scripts/meeting_notes edit <stable_id> --slug new-meeting-name

# Combine changes
scripts/meeting_notes edit <stable_id> --tag rhdh --recurring
```

**Note:** Editing updates the database only. Run `doctor --fix` to sync the filesystem.

### Doctor (Consistency Check)

Check and fix inconsistencies between the database and filesystem:

```bash
# Check for issues (dry-run)
scripts/meeting_notes doctor

# Fix issues (move files to match DB)
scripts/meeting_notes doctor --fix
```

**Detects:**

- Path mismatches (DB path ≠ actual filesystem location)
- Orphaned directories (files without DB record)

**Typical workflow after edits:**

```bash
# Edit meeting metadata
scripts/meeting_notes edit <stable_id> --tag new-tag

# Check what would change
scripts/meeting_notes doctor

# Apply filesystem changes
scripts/meeting_notes doctor --fix
```

## Tag Management

Tags categorize meetings and are stored in the JSONL database with optional metadata.

**List all tags:**

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes tags
scripts/meeting_notes --json tags  # For AI agents
```

**Create a new tag:**

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes tags add <name> [-d "description"] [-c "#hexcolor"]

# Examples:
scripts/meeting_notes tags add rhdh -d "Red Hat Developer Hub meetings" -c "#e63946"
scripts/meeting_notes tags add one-on-ones -d "1:1 meetings" -c "#457b9d"
```

**Edit tag metadata:**

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes tags edit <name> [-d "new description"] [-c "#newcolor"]
```

**Rename a tag:**

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes tags rename <old_name> <new_name>
```

Note: This renames the tag definition but does NOT update existing meetings. A migration may be needed.

**Delete a tag:**

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes tags delete <name>
scripts/meeting_notes tags delete <name> --force  # Delete even if meetings use it
```

**Tag record schema (JSONL):**

```json
{
  "type": "tag",
  "stable_id": "rhdh",
  "data": {
    "name": "rhdh",
    "description": "Red Hat Developer Hub meetings",
    "color": "#e63946",
    "created_at": "2026-01-12T...",
    "updated_at": "2026-01-12T..."
  }
}
```

**AI Agent workflow for tag management:**

1. Run `scripts/meeting_notes --json tags` to list current tags
2. Parse JSON to show user the tags with meeting counts
3. If user wants to add/edit/rename tags, use AskUserQuestion to confirm
4. Execute the appropriate `tags` subcommand

## State Management

**v2 Architecture:** The tool uses a JSONL database stored at the **repository root**:

```
<repo-root>/
  .meeting-notes/
    meetings.jsonl     # All meeting records (append-only)
    sync.jsonl         # Sync state records
    index.json         # Current state snapshot (rebuilt on startup)
  meetings/            # Output directory (filesystem structure)
```

The database stores:

- Meeting records with full metadata (title, date, attendees, Gemini assets)
- Sync state (timestamps, processed counts)
- Recurring patterns cache (for automatic classification)
- Tag definitions (name, description, color)
- Ignored patterns (meetings to skip)

**Key features:**

- **Append-only JSONL**: Each change appends a new record, enabling full audit trail
- **In-memory index**: Fast queries via snapshot, rebuilt on startup
- **Single source of truth**: All state in one place (no more fragmented state files)

**Important:** Events are only marked as "synced" after successful download. This means:

- Running `sync` multiple times is safe - it will rediscover pending meetings
- Only after `decide` + `download` complete are events marked synced
- If you interrupt the workflow, the next `sync` will show the same meetings again

## Standard Workflow

**Interactive workflow (recommended):**

```bash
# Step 1: Discover and match
scripts/meeting_notes sync
# → Review the decision table shown

# Step 2: After reviewing, apply decisions
# Option A: Accept all suggestions
scripts/meeting_notes decide --accept-all

# Option B: Override specific meetings, then accept the rest (recommended for small changes)
scripts/meeting_notes decide 7=rhdh,r 13=one-on-ones,r  # Override only #7 and #13
scripts/meeting_notes decide --accept-all               # Accept remaining suggestions

# Option C: Specify all meetings manually (for complete control)
scripts/meeting_notes decide 1=rhdh,r 2=team,o 3=one-on-ones,r ...

# Step 3: Download assets (after user approves)
scripts/meeting_notes download
```

**Note:**

- Always review the decision table before applying
- The two-step approach (Option B) is ideal when you agree with most suggestions
- The skill should ask for approval at each step

## Script Reference

**Location:** `scripts/meeting_notes` (recommended) or `scripts/meeting_notes` (legacy)

**Key commands:**

- `init` - Initialize database and configuration
- `sync` - Combined calendar discovery + Gemini email matching
- `decide` - Apply recurring and tag decisions
- `download` - Download meeting assets
- `status` - Check sync status
- `list` - Browse meetings with filters (tag, recurring, time, status)
- `show` - Display detailed info for a single meeting
- `edit` - Modify meeting metadata (tag, recurring, slug)
- `doctor` - Check/fix DB vs filesystem inconsistencies
- `tags` - Manage tag definitions (list, add, edit, rename, delete)
- `compact` - Compact JSONL database (remove obsolete records)

**Global flags:**

- `--json` - Output in JSON format (machine-readable, recommended for AI agents)
- `--verbose` - Enable verbose logging
- `--debug` - Enable debug mode

**Configuration:** `.meeting-notes.json` (automatically created with defaults)

**Database:** `.meeting-notes/` directory at repository root (JSONL files)

**Requirements:**

- `gwt` CLI tool (Google Workspace Tools) installed
- Google Workspace authentication configured (run `gwt credentials login`)
- Python 3.10+ (standard library only)

**Configuration:** The script uses `.meeting-notes.json` with these key settings:

- `gwt_command`: Full path to gwt binary (default: `/Users/mhild/src/rhdh/sidekick/google-workspace-tools/.venv/bin/gwt`)
- `user_email`: Your email address (used for 1:1 detection)

## Execution Pattern

**CRITICAL: This is an INTERACTIVE skill. Never auto-apply decisions without explicit user approval.**

When the user requests a meeting notes sync:

1. **Determine skill location:** Find where this SKILL.md is located and derive the script path from it
2. **Construct script path:** Build full path to `scripts/meeting_notes` from the skill directory
3. **Check current location:** Verify working directory is the pensieve repository root
4. **Run sync command with --json:** Execute `<skill-path>/scripts/meeting_notes sync --json`
5. **Parse JSON output:**
   - Extract `sync_summary`, `decision_table`, and `next_steps`
   - Analyze meetings for patterns (1:1s, recurring team meetings, one-offs, etc.)
   - Group similar meetings for intelligent proposals
6. **Present decision table and make intelligent proposals using AskUserQuestion:**
   - **CRITICAL:** Use the AskUserQuestion tool (not just text)
   - First, display the decision table in human-readable format (from decision_table.meetings)
   - Then analyze patterns and create grouped proposals:
     - Example: "I see 5 one-on-one meetings, 3 RHDH team meetings, and 2 planning sessions"
     - Group by pattern: "Meetings #1-5 appear to be 1:1s, suggest: one-on-ones,r"
     - Highlight exceptions: "Meeting #8 looks unusual (title doesn't match pattern)"
   - Question: "How would you like to classify these 10 meetings?"
   - Header: "Meeting Classification"
   - Options (customize based on detected patterns):
     1. label: "Accept all suggestions (Recommended)", description: "Apply suggested tags and recurring/one-off settings for all 10 meetings"
     2. label: "Accept patterns, customize anomalies", description: "Auto-classify the 8 meetings that match patterns (#1-5, #6-7), then I'll help with the 2 outliers (#8, #10)"
     3. label: "Review each meeting", description: "I'll show each meeting for individual decisions"
     4. label: "Skip for now", description: "Stop here and review later"
   - multiSelect: false
7. **Apply decisions based on user choice:**
   - If "Accept all suggestions": Run `<skill-path>/scripts/meeting_notes decide --accept-all`
   - If "Make manual changes":
     - Ask which meetings to change (get specific numbers and desired tag/recurring values)
     - Run `<skill-path>/scripts/meeting_notes decide [changes]` with only the overrides
     - Then run `<skill-path>/scripts/meeting_notes decide --accept-all` to apply suggestions to remaining meetings
     - Example: User wants to change #7 and #13 → Run `decide 7=rhdh,r 13=one-on-ones,r` then `decide --accept-all`
   - If "Skip for now": Stop and inform user they can run decide later
8. **After decide succeeds, use AskUserQuestion for download:**
   - Question: "Ready to download meeting transcripts, summaries, and attachments?"
   - Header: "Download"
   - Options:
     1. label: "Yes, download now (Recommended)", description: "Download all meeting assets to the meetings directory"
     2. label: "Skip download", description: "I'll download later manually"
   - multiSelect: false
   - If "Yes": Execute `<skill-path>/scripts/meeting_notes download`
   - If "Skip": Stop and inform user they can run download later
9. **Report summary:** Inform user of results

**Important:**

- ALWAYS use AskUserQuestion tool for approvals (never just ask in text)
- The user MUST see the decision table output before being asked to approve
- Never run `decide` or `download` automatically without approval
- `<skill-path>` should be derived from this SKILL.md file's location (e.g., if SKILL.md is at `/path/to/meeting-notes/SKILL.md`, then `<skill-path>` is `/path/to/meeting-notes`)

## Common Scenarios

### First-Time Sync

On first run, the tool syncs the last 7 days of meetings:

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes sync
scripts/meeting_notes decide --accept-all
scripts/meeting_notes download
```

### Incremental Sync

Subsequent syncs fetch only new meetings since last check:

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes sync
scripts/meeting_notes decide --accept-all
scripts/meeting_notes download
```

### Custom Date Range

Sync specific date range:

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes sync --after 2025-01-01 --before 2025-01-31
scripts/meeting_notes decide --accept-all
scripts/meeting_notes download
```

### Status Check

Check when meetings were last synced:

```bash
scripts/meeting_notes status
```

## Error Handling

**Authentication errors:**

- Check authentication status: `gwt credentials status`
- Re-authenticate if needed: `gwt credentials login`
- The script will automatically prompt for authentication if needed

**gwt command not found:**

- Update `gwt_command` in `.meeting-notes.json` to point to your gwt installation
- Find gwt location with: `which gwt`
- If missing, install from: https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google-workspace-tools

**Permission errors:**

- Some Google Drive files may be restricted
- Failed downloads are reported at the end with URLs for manual review

**Orphaned emails:**

- Gemini emails without calendar events are marked as "orphaned"
- These represent meetings the user wasn't invited to but received notes for
- Review and decide if they should be included

## Integration Notes

This skill focuses solely on the meeting notes sync workflow. It does not:

- Create GTD issues (handle separately)
- Log to jrnl (handle separately)
- Analyze meeting content (separate skill)

For meeting content analysis and action item extraction, use the meeting notes after they've been synced.

## Best Practices

**Run regularly:** Sync at least weekly to keep up with new meetings

**Review suggestions:** The tool provides intelligent suggestions for recurring/tags, but verify accuracy

**Tag consistently:** Use consistent tags for better organization over time

**Check failures:** Review any download failures and manually access files if needed

**State file:** Don't manually edit `.meeting-notes-state.json` - let the tool manage it

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Initialize (first time)
scripts/meeting_notes init

# Complete workflow
scripts/meeting_notes sync && \
scripts/meeting_notes decide --accept-all && \
scripts/meeting_notes download

# Check what's synced
scripts/meeting_notes status

# Browse meetings
scripts/meeting_notes list                    # all meetings
scripts/meeting_notes list --tag rhdh         # filter by tag
scripts/meeting_notes list --recurring        # recurring only
scripts/meeting_notes list --since 2025-01-01 # date range
scripts/meeting_notes show <stable_id>        # meeting details

# Compact database (optional, removes obsolete records)
scripts/meeting_notes compact

# Help
scripts/meeting_notes --help
scripts/meeting_notes list --help
```

## Architecture (v2)

The refactored architecture uses a clean separation of concerns:

```
scripts/meeting_notes_lib/
  db.py                    # JSONL database core
  models.py                # Data models (Meeting, Pattern, etc.)

  repositories/
    meeting_repo.py        # Meeting data access
    pattern_repo.py        # Pattern cache data access
    sync_repo.py           # Sync state data access

  services/
    calendar_utils.py      # Shared calendar utilities
    discovery.py           # DiscoveryService (calendar + email)
    decision.py            # DecisionService (classification)
    downloads.py           # DownloadService (asset download)
    output_sync.py         # OutputSyncService (DB -> filesystem)
```

Key improvements over v1:

- **Single JSONL database** instead of fragmented state files
- **Repository pattern** for clean data access
- **Service layer** eliminates 100+ lines of duplicated code
- **Testable architecture** with dependency injection
