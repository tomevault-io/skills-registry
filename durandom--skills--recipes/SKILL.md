description: Reusable development patterns and guides for AI-assisted workflows. Use when asking about CLI design for agents, CLI location, config discovery, vault, commenting standards, snapshot testing, credential storage, Python project architecture, semantic zoom, skill writing, Claude tools, agent teams, extracting deterministic work, plugin authoring and distribution, beads/dolt setup, or showboat/rodney/chartroom agent documentation. Use when this capability is needed.

## What Recipes Are

Recipes are **standalone reference documents** -- each captures a proven pattern or practice for AI-assisted development. They are not step-by-step procedures; they are knowledge you read and apply.

**Three categories:**

| Category | Recipes | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **AI Agent Patterns** | semantic-zoom, agentic-cli, extract-deterministic, showboat-ecosystem | Designing AI interactions, CLI tools for agents, or agent-driven documentation |
| **Development Practices** | comments, agent-skills, claude-tools, snapshot-testing | Writing code, skills, or tests in this ecosystem |
| **Distribution** | claude-plugin-authoring | Packaging skills as installable Claude Code plugins |
| **Architecture & Implementation** | python-project-architecture, keyring-credential-storage, cli-location-discovery | Structuring Python projects, handling credentials, or CLI location/config discovery |
| **Infrastructure & Setup** | beads-dolt-setup | Setting up beads issue tracker with Dolt server on macOS |

</essential_principles>

What pattern or practice do you need guidance on?

1. **AI agent CLI design** - Safe-by-default CLI patterns for agentic workflows
2. **Extracting deterministic work** - When to script vs. when to prompt
3. **Semantic zoom** - Controlling abstraction level in AI interactions
4. **Python commenting standards** - INTENT:, CRITICAL:, PERF: anchors
5. **Writing Claude Code skills** - Skill authoring patterns and best practices
6. **Claude Code tools reference** - All 20 native tools, coordination patterns, agent spawning
7. **Snapshot testing** - Approval testing with syrupy
8. **Python project architecture** - Project structure for CLI tools
9. **Keyring credential storage** - Secure credential management patterns
10. **Claude plugin authoring** - Packaging skills as installable plugins
11. **CLI location & config discovery** - Finding scripts and config from arbitrary cwd
12. **Beads + Dolt setup** - Installing and configuring beads with Dolt server on macOS
13. **Showboat ecosystem** - Agent-driven documentation with Showboat, Rodney, and Chartroom
