# Railway Skill

Manage Railway deployments directly from Viber. Uses the Railway CLI (`railway`) for deployment operations.

## Installation

Install Railway CLI:

```bash
pnpm add -g @railway/cli
# or
brew install railway
```

Then authenticate:

```bash
railway login
```

Link your project (run once in the project directory):

```bash
railway link
```

## Tools

- **`railway_status`** — Get deployment status for the linked project or a specific service
- **`railway_logs`** — View recent runtime logs
- **`railway_deploy`** — Trigger a redeployment
- **`railway_deployments`** — List recent deployments with status (SUCCESS/FAILED/BUILDING)
- **`railway_build_logs`** — Fetch build logs for a specific deployment by ID (for diagnosing build failures)
- **`railway_run`** — Run any Railway CLI command directly

## Parameters

### railway_status
- `service` (optional): Service name to check (defaults to all services)
- `cwd` (optional): Working directory (if unlinked/mismatched, auto-discovery will try matching repo-related project/service contexts)

### railway_logs
- `service` (optional): Service name to get logs for
- `lines` (optional): Number of log lines (default: 50, max: 500)
- `deploymentId` (optional): Deployment ID to fetch logs for (if omitted, uses latest deployment)
- `cwd` (optional): Working directory (if unlinked/mismatched, auto-discovery will try matching repo-related project/service contexts)

### railway_deploy
- `service` (optional): Service to redeploy
- `cwd` (optional): Working directory (if unlinked/mismatched, auto-discovery will try matching repo-related project/service contexts)

### railway_deployments
- `cwd` (optional): Working directory (if unlinked/mismatched, auto-discovery will try matching repo-related project/service contexts)

### railway_build_logs
- `deploymentId` (required): Deployment ID (UUID from railway_deployments output)
- `cwd` (optional): Working directory (if unlinked/mismatched, auto-discovery will try matching repo-related project/service contexts)

### railway_run
- `command` (required): Railway CLI subcommand and arguments (e.g. `variables list`)
- `cwd` (optional): Working directory (if unlinked/mismatched, auto-discovery will try matching repo-related project/service contexts)

## Usage from Viber

Use this skill when user intent is:

- "check railway deployment"
- "show railway logs"
- "redeploy on railway"
- "check deployment status"
- "why did the deployment fail"

Examples:

```ts
railway_status({ service: "web" })
railway_logs({ service: "web", lines: 100 })
railway_deploy({ service: "web" })
railway_deployments({})
railway_build_logs({ deploymentId: "abc-123..." })
railway_run({ command: "variables list" })
```

## Auto-Discovery Behavior

When a directory is not Railway-linked or linked to the wrong project, this skill will:

1. List accessible Railway projects via `railway list --json`
2. Score candidates using repository hints (cwd name + git remote URL)
3. Iterate candidate project/service contexts and retry commands
4. Return the first successful match, including discovery metadata in the summary

This allows the agent to keep trying across org/project/service combinations instead of failing on the first context mismatch.
