# ClickHouse Best Practices

Guidance for ClickHouse covering schema design, query optimization, and data ingestion. Contains 28 atomic rules across 3 categories (schema, query, insert), prioritized by impact. Extended with 14 reference files covering cluster management, backups, monitoring, and integrations.

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

### Credential Placeholders
Example credentials in documentation (`password123`, `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`) are placeholders only. Never use these in production. Use proper secret management:
- Environment variables
- Secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
- Kubernetes secrets (for K8s deployments)
- ClickHouse named collections with external configuration

### Installation & Operations
For installation and operational procedures:
- Follow official documentation links provided in reference files
- Prefer package managers (`apt`, `yum`, `helm`) over direct downloads
- Use versioned artifacts instead of `latest` in production
- Test procedures in non-production environments first

## IMPORTANT: How to Apply This Skill

**Before answering ClickHouse questions, follow this priority order:**

1. **Check for applicable rules** in the `rules/` directory
2. **If rules exist:** Apply them and cite them in your response using "Per `rule-name`..."
3. **If no rule exists:** Check `references/` for deeper topic coverage
4. **If neither covers it:** Use general ClickHouse knowledge or search documentation
5. **Always cite your source:** rule name, reference file, or URL

**Why rules take priority:** ClickHouse has specific behaviors (columnar storage, sparse indexes, merge tree mechanics) where general database intuition can be misleading. The rules encode validated, ClickHouse-specific guidance.

## Review Procedures

### For Schema Reviews (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE)

**Read these rule files in order:**

1. `rules/schema-pk-plan-before-creation.md` — ORDER BY is immutable
2. `rules/schema-pk-cardinality-order.md` — Column ordering in keys
3. `rules/schema-pk-prioritize-filters.md` — Filter column inclusion
4. `rules/schema-pk-filter-on-orderby.md` — Query filter alignment
5. `rules/schema-types-native-types.md` — Proper type selection
6. `rules/schema-types-minimize-bitwidth.md` — Numeric type sizing
7. `rules/schema-types-lowcardinality.md` — LowCardinality usage
8. `rules/schema-types-avoid-nullable.md` — Nullable vs DEFAULT
9. `rules/schema-types-enum.md` — Enum for finite value sets
10. `rules/schema-partition-low-cardinality.md` — Partition count limits
11. `rules/schema-partition-lifecycle.md` — Partitioning purpose
12. `rules/schema-partition-query-tradeoffs.md` — Partition pruning trade-offs
13. `rules/schema-partition-start-without.md` — Start without partitioning
14. `rules/schema-json-when-to-use.md` — JSON type usage

**Check for:**
- [ ] PRIMARY KEY / ORDER BY column order (low-to-high cardinality)
- [ ] Data types match actual data ranges
- [ ] LowCardinality applied to appropriate string columns
- [ ] Partition key cardinality bounded (100-1,000 values)
- [ ] ReplacingMergeTree has version column if used

### For Query Reviews (SELECT, JOIN, aggregations)

**Read these rule files:**

1. `rules/query-join-choose-algorithm.md` — Algorithm selection
2. `rules/query-join-use-any.md` — ANY vs regular JOIN
3. `rules/query-join-filter-before.md` — Pre-join filtering
4. `rules/query-join-consider-alternatives.md` — Dictionaries/denormalization
5. `rules/query-join-null-handling.md` — join_use_nulls setting
6. `rules/query-index-skipping-indices.md` — Secondary index usage
7. `rules/query-mv-incremental.md` — Incremental materialized views
8. `rules/query-mv-refreshable.md` — Refreshable materialized views

**Check for:**
- [ ] Filters use ORDER BY prefix columns
- [ ] JOINs filter tables before joining (not after)
- [ ] Correct JOIN algorithm for table sizes
- [ ] Skipping indices for non-ORDER BY filter columns

### For Insert Strategy Reviews (data ingestion, updates, deletes)

**Read these rule files:**

1. `rules/insert-batch-size.md` — Batch sizing requirements
2. `rules/insert-async-small-batches.md` — Async insert usage
3. `rules/insert-format-native.md` — Native format for performance
4. `rules/insert-mutation-avoid-update.md` — UPDATE alternatives
5. `rules/insert-mutation-avoid-delete.md` — DELETE alternatives
6. `rules/insert-optimize-avoid-final.md` — OPTIMIZE TABLE risks

**Check for:**
- [ ] Batch size 10K-100K rows per INSERT
- [ ] No ALTER TABLE UPDATE for frequent changes
- [ ] ReplacingMergeTree or CollapsingMergeTree for update patterns
- [ ] Async inserts enabled for high-frequency small batches

## Output Format

Structure review responses as follows:

```
## Rules Checked
- `rule-name-1` — Compliant / Violation found
- `rule-name-2` — Compliant / Violation found
...

## Findings

### Violations
- **`rule-name`**: Description of the issue
  - Current: [what the code does]
  - Required: [what it should do]
  - Fix: [specific correction]

### Compliant
- `rule-name`: Brief note on why it's correct

## Recommendations
[Prioritized list of changes, citing rules]
```

## Quick Decision Guides

### Which Table Engine?

```
Need to store data?
├── < 1M rows, dimension → Memory
└── ≥ 1M rows → MergeTree family
    ├── Deduplication? → ReplacingMergeTree(version)
    ├── Changelog? → CollapsingMergeTree(sign)
    ├── Pre-aggregation? → AggregatingMergeTree()
    ├── Replication? → ReplicatedMergeTree(...)
    └── Default → MergeTree()
```

See `references/table-engines.md` for complete reference.

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Too many parts | `OPTIMIZE TABLE table FINAL` (see `insert-optimize-avoid-final`) |
| Slow query | `EXPLAIN SELECT ...` to check index usage |
| Mutation stuck | Check `system.mutations`, consider alternatives per `insert-mutation-avoid-update` |
| Replication lag | Check `system.replication_queue`, ZooKeeper |
| OOM on query | Increase `max_memory_usage`, optimize query |

See `references/debugging.md` for detailed troubleshooting.
