# Evolution Skill

This skill enables Pi Agent to self-improve continuously during development by capturing learnings, correcting errors, and validating skills.

## Hooks Integration

Evolution uses Pi Agent's hooks system to automatically detect opportunities for improvement.

### Hook Installation

Create or edit `~/.pi/hooks/evolution.ts`:

```typescript
import type { HookAPI } from "@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent/hooks";

export default function (api: HookAPI) {
  // Monitor tool results for error detection
  api.on("tool_result", async (event, ctx) => {
    if (event.tool === "bash") {
      await detectErrorPatterns(event, ctx);
    }
  });

  // Monitor session end for learning capture
  api.on("session", async (event, ctx) => {
    if (event.reason === "shutdown") {
      await promptLearningCapture(ctx);
    }
  });

  // Monitor context for new patterns
  api.on("context", async (event, ctx) => {
    await detectNewPatterns(event, ctx);
  });
}
```

### What Hooks Do

| Hook Event | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| `tool_result` | After bash command | Detect compilation errors, suggest fixes |
| `session` (shutdown) | Session ends | Prompt to capture learnings |
| `context` | Context transformation | Analyze for new patterns |

---

## When to Evolve

Trigger skill evolution when any of these occur during development:

| Trigger | Target Skill | Priority |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| New coding pattern discovered | Relevant skill | High |
| Error/debug solution found | troubleshooting skill | High |
| API usage pattern learned | core/reference skill | High |
| Build/packaging issue resolved | deployment skill | Medium |
| Project structure insight | getting-started skill | Low |
| Core concept clarified | core skill | Low |

---

## Evolution Process

### Step 1: Identify Knowledge Worth Capturing

Ask yourself:
- Is this a reusable pattern? (not project-specific)
- Did it take significant effort to figure out?
- Would it help other developers using Pi Agent?
- Is it not already documented in existing skills?

### Step 2: Classify the Knowledge

```
Coding Pattern           → relevant skill (e.g., typescript, patterns)
Error/Debug Solution     → troubleshooting skill
API Usage Pattern        → core/reference skill
Build/Deploy Issue       → deployment skill
Project Structure        → getting-started skill
Core Concept/API         → core skill
```

### Step 3: Use Workhub to Create Issue

```bash
# From project root directory
cd /path/to/project
bun ~/.pi/agent/skills/workhub/lib.ts create issue "evolution: add new pattern" [category]
```

### Step 4: Format the Contribution

**For Patterns**:
```markdown
## Pattern N: [Pattern Name]

Brief description of what this pattern solves.

### Implementation
\`\`\`typescript
// TypeScript code
\`\`\`

### Usage
\`\`\`typescript
// Example usage
\`\`\`
```

**For Troubleshooting**:
```markdown
### [Error Type/Message]

**Symptom**: What the developer sees

**Cause**: Why this happens

**Solution**:
\`\`\`typescript
// Fixed code
\`\`\`
```

### Step 5: Mark Evolution

Add an evolution marker above new content:

```markdown
<!-- Evolution: YYYY-MM-DD | source: project-name | author: @user -->
```

### Step 6: Submit via Workhub PR

```bash
# Create PR for your contribution
bun ~/.pi/agent/skills/workhub/lib.ts create pr "evolution: add new pattern" [category]
```

---

## Self-Correction

When skill content causes errors, automatically correct it.

### Trigger Conditions

```
User follows skill advice → Code fails to compile/run
                      ↓
                 Detect error
                      ↓
         Suggest correction to user
                      ↓
         Create workhub issue with fix
```

### Correction Flow

1. **Detect** - Skill advice led to an error
2. **Verify** - Confirm the skill content is wrong
3. **Suggest** - Propose fix to user
4. **Create Issue** - Document in workhub

### Correction Marker Format

```markdown
<!-- Correction: YYYY-MM-DD | was: [old advice] | reason: [why it was wrong] -->
```

---

## Self-Validation

Periodically verify skill content is still accurate.

### Validation Checklist

```markdown

## Auto-Evolution Prompts

Use these prompts to trigger self-evolution:

### After Solving a Problem
> "This solution should be added to skills for future reference. Use workhub to create an evolution issue."

### After Creating a Pattern
> "This pattern is reusable. Let me create an evolution issue to document it."

### After Debugging
> "This error and its fix should be documented. Create an evolution issue in workhub."

### After Completing a Feature
> "Review what I learned and create evolution issues if applicable."

---

## Quality Guidelines

### DO Add
- Generic, reusable patterns
- Common errors with clear solutions
- Well-tested code examples
- Platform-specific gotchas
- Performance optimizations
- TypeScript/JavaScript best practices

### DON'T Add
- Project-specific code
- Unverified solutions
- Duplicate content
- Incomplete examples
- Personal preferences without rationale

---

## Continuous Improvement Checklist

After each development session, consider:

- [ ] Did I discover a new coding pattern?
- [ ] Did I solve a tricky error?
- [ ] Did I find a better way to structure code?
- [ ] Did I learn something about TypeScript/JavaScript?
- [ ] Did I encounter and fix a confusing issue?
- [ ] Would any of this help other developers?

If yes to any, use workhub to create an evolution issue!
