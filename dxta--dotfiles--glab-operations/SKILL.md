# GitLab Operations

Manage GitLab repositories efficiently using the `glab` CLI for merge requests, issues, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Overview

This skill provides structured guidance for common GitLab operations:
- **Merge Requests**: Create, review, merge, checkout MRs
- **Issues**: Create, list, close, comment on issues
- **CI/CD**: Monitor pipelines, view logs, retry jobs
- **Search**: Find issues, MRs across repositories

## Prerequisites

**Required**:
- `glab` CLI installed (`glab --version`)
- Authenticated with GitLab (`glab auth status`)

**Verify Setup**:
```bash
glab auth status
```

If not authenticated:
```bash
glab auth login
```

## Working with GitLab URLs

When given a GitLab HTTPS URL, **always convert it to the `glab` CLI format** using `-R owner/repo` rather than using the URL directly.

### URL Pattern Reference

| URL Type | URL Pattern | Command Format |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Repository | `https://gitlab.com/{owner}/{repo}` | `-R owner/repo` |
| Merge Request | `https://gitlab.com/{owner}/{repo}/-/merge_requests/{N}` | `glab mr view N -R owner/repo` |
| Issue | `https://gitlab.com/{owner}/{repo}/-/issues/{N}` | `glab issue view N -R owner/repo` |
| Pipeline | `https://gitlab.com/{owner}/{repo}/-/pipelines/{id}` | `glab ci view -R owner/repo` |
| Job | `https://gitlab.com/{owner}/{repo}/-/jobs/{id}` | `glab ci trace {id} -R owner/repo` |

### URL Conversion Examples

**Merge Request URL**:
```bash
# Given: https://gitlab.com/mygroup/myproject/-/merge_requests/42
# Extract: owner=mygroup, repo=myproject, number=42

glab mr view 42 -R mygroup/myproject
glab mr checkout 42 -R mygroup/myproject
glab mr merge 42 -R mygroup/myproject --squash
```

**Issue URL**:
```bash
# Given: https://gitlab.com/org/project/-/issues/15
# Extract: owner=org, repo=project, number=15

glab issue view 15 -R org/project
glab issue note 15 -R org/project -m "Looking into this"
```

**Pipeline URL**:
```bash
# Given: https://gitlab.com/org/repo/-/pipelines/123456789
# Extract: owner=org, repo=repo

glab ci view -R org/repo
glab ci view -R org/repo --web
```

### Why Prefer `-R` Over URLs

1. **Consistency**: All `glab` commands use the same `-R owner/repo` format
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify owner/repo without URL encoding issues
3. **Composability**: Can chain commands using the same repo reference
4. **Clarity**: Command intent is immediately visible

## Claude Attribution

When posting comments or reviews on behalf of the user, **always include the Claude signature** at the end of the message body to indicate it was AI-generated.

### Signature Format

```

### Usage Examples

**MR Review with signature**:
```bash
glab mr approve 42
glab mr note 42 -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
LGTM! The implementation looks solid.

```

**Issue comment with signature**:
```bash
glab issue note 15 -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
I've identified the root cause - the timeout occurs because...

```

**MR comment with signature**:
```bash
glab mr note 7 -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
This approach could cause a race condition. Consider using a mutex here.

### When to Include

| Operation | Include Signature |
|-----------|-------------------|
| MR reviews (approve/note) | Yes |
| MR comments | Yes |
| Issue comments | Yes |
| Issue creation (body) | Yes |
| MR creation (body) | Yes |
| Closing with comment | Yes |
| Merge commit messages | No (use git commit signature instead) |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Determine Operation Type

Identify which GitLab operation is needed:
- **MR operations**: creation, review, merge, checkout
- **Issue operations**: creation, management, comments
- **CI/CD**: pipeline monitoring, job management
- **Search**: finding issues/MRs across repos

### Step 2: Execute Operation

#### Merge Request Operations

**Create MR** (from current branch, include Claude signature in body):
```bash
glab mr create --title "Feature: Add login" --description "$(cat <<'EOF'
Implements user authentication.

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
EOF
)"
```

**Create MR with template** (auto-fill from commits):
```bash
glab mr create --fill
```

**Create MR for an issue**:
```bash
glab mr for 34  # Creates MR linked to issue #34
glab mr for 34 --wip  # Creates as Work in Progress
```

**List open MRs**:
```bash
glab mr list --state opened
glab mr list --assignee=@me  # Your MRs only
glab mr list --reviewer=@me  # MRs you need to review
```

**View MR details**:
```bash
glab mr view [number]
glab mr view [number] --web  # Open in browser
glab mr view [number] --comments  # Include comments
```

**Checkout MR locally**:
```bash
glab mr checkout [number]
```

**Merge MR**:
```bash
glab mr merge [number] --squash  # Squash merge
glab mr merge [number]           # Regular merge
glab mr merge [number] --rebase  # Rebase merge
glab mr merge [number] --remove-source-branch  # Delete branch after merge
```

**Review MR** (include Claude signature):
```bash
# Approve MR
glab mr approve [number]

# Add comment with review
glab mr note [number] -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
LGTM!

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
EOF
)"
```

See `{baseDir}/references/glab-mr-workflows.md` for advanced patterns.

#### Issue Operations

**Create issue** (include Claude signature in body):
```bash
glab issue create --title "Bug: Login fails" --description "$(cat <<'EOF'
Steps to reproduce...

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
EOF
)"
glab issue create --label bug --assignee @me --title "Bug title" --description "$(cat <<'EOF'
Description here.

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
EOF
)"
```

**List issues**:
```bash
glab issue list --state opened
glab issue list --label bug --state opened
glab issue list --assignee=@me
```

**View issue**:
```bash
glab issue view [number]
glab issue view [number] --web
glab issue view [number] --comments
```

**Comment on issue** (include Claude signature):
```bash
glab issue note [number] -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Working on this now.

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
EOF
)"
```

**Close issue**:
```bash
glab issue close [number]
```

**Subscribe to issue**:
```bash
glab issue subscribe [number]
```

See `{baseDir}/references/glab-issue-workflows.md` for advanced patterns.

#### CI/CD Pipeline Operations

**View current pipeline**:
```bash
glab ci view  # Current branch
glab ci view main  # Specific branch
glab ci view --web  # Open in browser
```

**Get pipeline status**:
```bash
glab ci get
glab ci get --output json  # JSON output
```

**List pipelines**:
```bash
glab ci list
```

**Trace job logs**:
```bash
glab ci trace  # Interactive selection
glab ci trace [job-id]  # Specific job
glab ci trace [job-name]  # By job name (e.g., "lint")
```

**Retry failed job**:
```bash
glab ci retry [job-id]
```

**Trigger manual job**:
```bash
glab ci trigger [job-id]
```

**Download artifacts**:
```bash
glab ci artifact [ref] [job-name]
```

**Delete old pipelines**:
```bash
glab ci delete [pipeline-id]
glab ci delete --status=failed  # All failed pipelines
glab ci delete --older-than 24h  # Older than 24 hours
```

**Lint CI config**:
```bash
glab ci lint
glab ci lint --dry-run  # Simulate without running
```

See `{baseDir}/references/glab-ci-workflows.md` for advanced patterns.

### Step 3: Verify Result

After each operation:
1. Check command output for success/error messages
2. For MRs/issues, note the URL returned
3. For CI/CD, verify pipeline/job status

## Output

- **MR/Issue URLs**: Links to created/modified items
- **Status messages**: Success/failure confirmations
- **Pipeline status**: Run state and results

## Error Handling

1. **Error**: `glab: command not found`
   **Cause**: glab CLI not installed
   **Solution**: Install via `brew install glab` or see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli

2. **Error**: `glab auth: No GitLab hosts configured`
   **Cause**: Not authenticated
   **Solution**: Run `glab auth login` and follow prompts

3. **Error**: `404 Project Not Found`
   **Cause**: Not in a git repo or repo not on GitLab
   **Solution**: Ensure you're in a git repo with GitLab remote, or use `-R owner/repo`

4. **Error**: `403 Forbidden`
   **Cause**: Insufficient permissions
   **Solution**: Check project access or request permissions

5. **Error**: `merge request create failed: The merge request has no commits`
   **Cause**: No changes to merge
   **Solution**: Ensure branch has commits ahead of target

## Examples

### Example 1: Create and Merge MR

**User Request**: "Create an MR for my feature branch"

**Commands**:
```bash
# Create MR with auto-fill from commits
glab mr create --fill

# After review, merge with squash
glab mr merge --squash --remove-source-branch
```

### Example 2: Triage Issues

**User Request**: "Show me open bugs assigned to me"

**Command**:
```bash
glab issue list --label bug --assignee=@me --state opened
```

**Output**:
```
Showing 2 of 2 issues

#42  Login timeout on slow networks    bug, priority::high   about 2 hours ago
#38  Session expires unexpectedly      bug                   about 1 day ago
```

### Example 3: Debug Failed Pipeline

**User Request**: "The CI failed, show me what went wrong"

**Commands**:
```bash
# View pipeline status
glab ci view

# Trace failed job logs
glab ci trace

# Or get specific job logs
glab ci trace lint
```
