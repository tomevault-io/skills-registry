# PRD Master - Complete Product Requirements Document Workflow

## Overview

This skill orchestrates the complete PRD creation process using the integrated toolset available in this repository. It guides users through six systematic phases: exploration, project foundation, requirements gathering, quality validation, design preparation, and implementation planning.

**Key Capabilities:**
- 🎯 **Intelligent Phase Selection** - Automatically selects the right tool based on project complexity and scope
- 🔄 **Interactive Workflow** - Guides users through structured decision-making processes
- 📋 **Quality Assurance** - Built-in validation and expert review processes
- 👥 **Team Coordination** - Generates role-specific prompts and checklists
- 📊 **Business Intelligence** - Integrates multi-expert analysis when needed

## When to Use This Skill

**Perfect for:**
- New product development projects
- Major feature additions to existing products
- System redesigns or architectural changes
- Complex feature requirements with multiple stakeholders
- When you need both business and technical requirements

**Triggers:**
- "Help me create a PRD for..."
- "I need to write product requirements for..."
- "Let's spec out a new feature..."
- "We need requirements documentation for..."
- Any mention of PRD, product specs, or requirements documents

## Phase Selection Logic

The skill automatically selects the appropriate starting phase based on user input:

### 🚀 Phase 1: Exploration (Ideation Stage)
**Use when:**
- User has vague ideas or initial concepts
- Multiple possible directions exist
- Market validation is needed
- Business case needs strengthening

**Tools used:**
```bash
/sc:brainstorm "user concept"          # Interactive discovery
/sc:business-panel "market analysis"    # Multi-expert analysis
```

### 🏗️ Phase 2: Project Foundation (Scoping Stage)
**Use when:**
- User has clear idea but needs structure
- Project scope needs definition
- Success metrics need establishment

**Tools used:**
```bash
# Create project brief using BMAD template
# Uses .bmad-core/templates/project-brief-tmpl.yaml
```

### 📋 Phase 3: Requirements Generation (Specification Stage)
**Use when:**
- Clear project scope established
- Ready for detailed requirements
- **Default starting point for most projects**

**Tools used:**
```bash
# Choose based on complexity:
- /speckit.specify "feature description"     # Single feature
- BMAD PRD Template (.bmad-core/templates/prd-tmpl.yaml)  # Complex product
- openspec changes/ for architecture modifications
```

### 🔍 Phase 4: Quality Validation (Review Stage)
**Always executed after requirements generation**

**Tools used:**
```bash
# BMAD quality checklists
openspec validate [change] --strict  # For OpenSpec workflows
```

### 🎨 Phase 5: Design Preparation (Handoff Stage)
**Use when:**
- Requirements validated and approved
- Ready for technical design

**Tools used:**
```bash
/sc:design "system architecture"
/sc:spec-panel "technical review"
```

### 🛠️ Phase 6: Implementation Planning (Execution Stage)
**Use when:**
- Design complete and approved
- Ready for development work

**Tools used:**
```bash
/sc:workflow "implementation planning"
# Generates team-specific prompts and checklists
```

## Workflow Execution

### Step 1: Assess User Input
Analyze the user's request to determine:
- **Clarity Level**: Vague idea vs. clear concept
- **Complexity**: Simple feature vs. complex product
- **Scope**: Single function vs. multi-epic project
- **Stakeholder Count**: Individual vs. team project

### Step 2: Select Starting Phase
Based on assessment, choose the appropriate phase:
- **Low clarity, high uncertainty** → Phase 1 (Exploration)
- **Moderate clarity, defined scope** → Phase 2 (Foundation)
- **High clarity, ready for specs** → Phase 3 (Requirements) - *Default*

### Step 3: Execute Phase Workflow
Follow the structured workflow for the selected phase, automatically triggering the appropriate tools and processes.

### Step 4: Progressive Enhancement
After each phase completion, assess readiness for the next phase. Users can:
- **Continue automatically** to the next phase
- **Pause for review** and manual approval
- **Jump to specific phase** if ready

### Step 5: Generate Team Deliverables
Create role-specific outputs:
- **Product Manager**: Complete PRD with checklists
- **UX Expert**: Design brief and user scenarios
- **Architect**: Technical requirements and constraints
- **Development Team**: Implementation roadmap

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: New Product Idea
```
User: "Help me create a PRD for a new task management app"

Workflow:
1. Phase 1: /sc:brainstorm "task management app features"
2. Phase 1: /sc:business-panel "productivity app market analysis"
3. Phase 2: Create project brief
4. Phase 3: BMAD PRD Template generation
5. Phase 4: Quality validation
6. Phase 5: /sc:design preparation
7. Phase 6: /sc:workflow generation
```

### Example 2: Single Feature Addition
```
User: "I need to write requirements for adding user authentication"

Workflow:
1. Phase 3: /speckit.specify "add user authentication system"
2. Phase 4: Quality checklist generation
3. Phase 5: /sc:design "authentication architecture"
```

### Example 3: System Redesign
```
User: "We need to restructure our microservices architecture"

Workflow:
1. Phase 3: openspec changes/ (create change proposal)
2. Phase 4: openspec validate --strict
3. Phase 5: /sc:spec-panel "architecture review"
```
