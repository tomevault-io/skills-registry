# Gobbler Browser

Control the browser via the Gobbler CLI and browser extension. Includes integrations for AI chat services.

**Requires**: 
- Gobbler browser extension installed
- Target tabs in "Gobbler" tab group
- Relay server (auto-starts when needed)

> **Note**: AI chat integrations (NotebookLM, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) use DOM automation and may break when sites update their UI.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check browser connection
gobbler browser status

# List tabs in Gobbler group
gobbler browser list

# Inject APIs into all Gobbler tabs (required for AI chat integrations)
gobbler browser inject

# Extract current page to markdown
gobbler browser extract -o page.md
```

---

## Core Browser Commands

### Check Status

```bash
gobbler browser status
```

Shows relay status and number of connected extensions.

### List Tabs

```bash
# All tabs in Gobbler group
gobbler browser list

# Filter by site
gobbler browser list --filter notebooklm
gobbler browser list --filter claude
gobbler browser list --filter chatgpt
gobbler browser list --filter gemini

# JSON output
gobbler browser list --json
```

### Inject APIs

Inject page-specific APIs into all tabs in the Gobbler group. **Required** before using AI chat commands (especially after page refresh or extension reload).

```bash
gobbler browser inject
```

### Open URLs

```bash
# Open one or more URLs in Gobbler tab group
gobbler browser open "https://example.com"
gobbler browser open "https://example.com" "https://google.com"

# Read URLs from file
gobbler browser open -f urls.txt
```

### Navigate Current Tab

```bash
gobbler browser navigate "https://example.com"
```

### Extract Page Content

```bash
# Full page as markdown
gobbler browser extract

# Save to file
gobbler browser extract -o page.md

# With CSS selector
gobbler browser extract --selector "article.content"

# From specific tab
gobbler browser extract --tab 1234567890
```

### Execute JavaScript

```bash
# In active tab
gobbler browser exec "document.title"

# In specific tab
gobbler browser exec "document.title" --tab 1234567890

# With timeout
gobbler browser exec "await fetch('/api').then(r => r.json())" --timeout 30
```

# AI Chat Integrations

These integrations use browser DOM automation to interact with AI chat services. They share common patterns and prerequisites.

> **Fragility Warning**: These integrations depend on CSS selectors and DOM structure that may change when sites update. If commands stop working, check for extension/skill updates.

## Common Prerequisites

1. **Browser extension installed** - Load `browser-extension/` folder in Chrome
2. **Tab in "Gobbler" group** - Right-click tab -> "Add to group" -> name it "Gobbler"
3. **Relay running** - Auto-starts when you run commands
4. **APIs injected** - Run `gobbler browser inject` after page refresh

## CRITICAL: One Query at a Time

**Send only ONE query at a time to each conversation, then WAIT for the response.**

Why? The query command waits for the "last message" in the chat. If you send multiple queries in parallel:
- All questions get submitted
- The first query's script may return the WRONG answer (from a later question)
- You get mismatched question/answer pairs

```bash
# CORRECT - Sequential
gobbler notebooklm query "Question 1" --timeout 120
# Wait for response, then:
gobbler notebooklm query "Question 2" --timeout 120

# WRONG - Parallel (will get mismatched answers)
gobbler notebooklm query "Question 1" &
gobbler notebooklm query "Question 2" &
```

## Common Workflow

All AI chat integrations follow this pattern:

```bash
# 1. Inject APIs (required after page refresh or extension reload)
gobbler browser inject

# 2. List available tabs
gobbler <service> list

# 3. Send query and get response (waits for complete answer)
gobbler <service> query "Your question here" --timeout 120

# 4. If response looks incomplete, get full last response
gobbler <service> last
```

---

## NotebookLM Integration

Query Google NotebookLM notebooks through browser automation.

### Commands

```bash
# List NotebookLM tabs
gobbler notebooklm list

# Send query and wait for response
gobbler notebooklm query "What are the main themes?" --timeout 120

# Target specific notebook by tab ID
gobbler notebooklm query "Summarize" --tab 1700453262

# Get last response (use if output looks truncated)
gobbler notebooklm last

# Get chat history
gobbler notebooklm history           # Last 5 messages
gobbler notebooklm history -n 10     # Last 10 messages
gobbler notebooklm history --all     # All messages

# Get notebook metadata
gobbler notebooklm info
```

### Options
- `--timeout SECONDS` - Max wait time (default: 150)
- `-t/--tab TAB_ID` - Target specific tab

### Tips
- Be specific: "What does source X say about Y?" works better than vague questions
- Ask for citations: Add "with citations" to get source references
- One topic per query: Break complex questions into focused queries

---

## Claude.ai Integration

Send messages to Claude.ai conversations through browser automation.

### Commands

```bash
# List Claude.ai tabs
gobbler claude list

# Send message and wait for response
gobbler claude query "Explain quantum computing" --timeout 150

# Get chat history
gobbler claude history           # Last 10 messages

gobbler claude history --all     # All messages

# Get conversation metadata
gobbler claude info
```

### Options
- `--timeout SECONDS` - Max wait time (default: 150)
- `-t/--tab TAB_ID` - Target specific tab
- `-n/--count NUMBER` - Number of messages for history

### Notes
- Gemini requires a Google account
- Check regional availability if you get errors

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Relay not running"

```bash
gobbler relay start
gobbler relay status
```

### "No browser extension connected"

1. Ensure Gobbler extension is installed in Chrome/Edge
2. Check extension popup shows "Connected" 
3. Verify target tabs are in the "Gobbler" tab group

### "No tabs found"

1. Open the page you want to control
2. Right-click the tab -> "Add to group" -> "Gobbler"
3. Run `gobbler browser list` again

### "API not injected" / Commands not working

1. Run `gobbler browser inject`
2. If still failing, reload the extension in chrome://extensions
3. Refresh the target page
4. Run `gobbler browser inject` again

### Timeout errors

Increase the timeout for complex responses:

```bash
gobbler <service> query "Complex question" --timeout 300
```

### Truncated responses

Use the `last` command to get the full response:

```bash
gobbler <service> last
```

### Garbled/wrong responses

You probably sent parallel queries. STOP. Wait for each query to complete before sending the next.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Browser extension** installed (load `browser-extension/` folder)
