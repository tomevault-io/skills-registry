## Agent Quality Checklist (7 Points)

### 1. YAML Frontmatter Complete and Valid ✅
- [ ] `name:` present (lowercase-hyphenated)
- [ ] `description:` present and action-oriented
- [ ] `model:` specified (sonnet or inherit)
- [ ] `color:` specified (optional but recommended)
- [ ] YAML syntax valid (no indentation errors)

**Why**: Frontmatter enables Claude Code to discover and invoke agents correctly.

**Example**:
```yaml
---
name: dbt-expert
description: dbt transformation specialist. Consult proactively for model optimization, testing strategies, and performance issues.
model: sonnet
color: blue
---
```

### 2. Single-Purpose Focus ✅
- [ ] Agent has one clear responsibility
- [ ] Scope is neither too broad nor too narrow
- [ ] Role clearly defined in opening paragraph
- [ ] Expertise domain explicitly stated

**Why**: Single-purpose agents are easier to invoke correctly and provide more focused expertise.

**Anti-pattern**: "General data expert" (too broad)
**Good pattern**: "dbt transformation specialist" (focused)

### 3. Detailed System Prompt with Examples ✅
- [ ] Opening paragraph states agent's role
- [ ] Core responsibilities listed (3-7 items)
- [ ] Expertise areas documented
- [ ] Example consultations provided
- [ ] Output format specified

**Why**: Detailed prompts improve agent response quality and consistency.

**Sections to include**:
- Role & Expertise
- Core Responsibilities
- Available Tools
- Example Consultations
- Quality Standards

### 4. Strategic Tool Restrictions ✅
- [ ] Only necessary tools granted
- [ ] Tool access rationale documented
- [ ] Restricted tools explicitly listed
- [ ] Security implications considered

**Why**: Limiting tools maintains focus and reduces security risk.

**Example**:
```markdown
### ✅ Allowed Tools
- Read, Grep, Glob (analysis)
- WebFetch (documentation research)

### ❌ Restricted Tools
- Bash, Write (research-only agent)
```

### 5. Action-Oriented Description ✅
- [ ] Description uses active verbs
- [ ] Includes "Consult proactively" or similar
- [ ] Specifies when to delegate
- [ ] Triggers are clear

**Why**: Encourages Claude to delegate to specialists when appropriate.

**Good**: "Consult proactively for dbt optimization, testing, and performance issues"
**Bad**: "Helps with dbt" (passive, vague)

### 6. Quality Standards Documented ✅
- [ ] Output format specified
- [ ] Quality requirements listed
- [ ] Validation protocols included
- [ ] Success criteria defined

**Why**: Ensures consistent, high-quality agent outputs.

**Example**:
```markdown
## Quality Standards

**Every recommendation must include**:
- ✅ Analysis of current state
- ✅ Specific recommendations
- ✅ Implementation steps
- ✅ Validation approach
```

### 7. Integration with Agent Ecosystem ✅
- [ ] Related specialists documented
- [ ] Delegation patterns explained
- [ ] MCP tool usage specified (if applicable)
- [ ] Consultation protocol defined

**Why**: Agents work together effectively when integration is clear.

**Error handling**: [what to do if fails]
```

### 2. Error Handling and Rollback ✅
- [ ] Failure scenarios identified

**Action**: Suggest alternative or checkout existing
```

### 3. Reusability Across Contexts ✅
- [ ] Works with different inputs
- [ ] No hardcoded project-specific values
- [ ] Templates use variables
- [ ] Tested with diverse scenarios

**Why**: Skills should be reusable, not one-off scripts.

**Use variables**: `{project_name}`, `{date}`, `{user_input}`

### 4. Quality Standards and Validation ✅
- [ ] Success criteria defined
- [ ] Output validation checks
- [ ] Quality requirements listed
- [ ] Acceptance tests specified

**Why**: Skills should validate their own outputs.

**Example**:
```markdown
## Quality Standards

- [ ] Examples provided for key workflows
- [ ] Clear do's and don'ts
- [ ] No vague guidance

**Why**: Specific instructions improve Claude's effectiveness.

**Bad**: "Write good code"

### 2. Markdown Structure with Clear Headers ✅
- [ ] Logical hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- [ ] Table of contents if >300 lines
- [ ] Code blocks properly formatted
- [ ] Lists consistently styled

**Why**: Well-structured documentation is easier to parse and reference.

### 3. Import Patterns for Modularity (if >500 lines) ✅
- [ ] Main CLAUDE.md is focused (<300 lines ideal)
- [ ] Detailed patterns imported from .claude/rules/ and .claude/skills/reference-knowledge/
- [ ] Import syntax: `@path/to/pattern.md`
- [ ] Imported files are self-contained

**Why**: Modular structure improves readability and maintainability.

**Example**:
```markdown
## Git Workflow
See @.claude/rules/git-workflow-patterns.md

## Testing
See @.claude/skills/reference-knowledge/testing-patterns/SKILL.md
```

### 4. Progressive Disclosure ✅
- [ ] Most important info first
- [ ] Quick reference at top
- [ ] Detailed sections below
- [ ] Advanced topics last

**Why**: Claude should find key information quickly.

**Structure**:
1. Quick Start / Most Important
2. Core Workflows
3. Reference Documentation
4. Advanced Topics

### 5. Version Control and Team Sharing ✅

**Confidence**: 0.95 (High)
```

### 2. Decision Criteria ("When to Use") ✅
- [ ] Clear triggering conditions

- [ ] Trade-offs documented
- [ ] Anti-patterns identified

**Why**: Helps decide when to apply the pattern.

**Example**:
```markdown
## When to Use This Pattern

- ✅ Query runtime > 1 hour
- ✅ Source system supports incremental extraction

**Don't use when**:
- ❌ Small datasets (<1M rows)
- ❌ Full refresh is acceptably fast
- ❌ Source system lacks updated_at column
```

### 3. Real-World Examples ✅
