# MCP Server Addition Protocol

**Purpose**: Checklist for adding new MCP servers to ensure complete integration
**Created**: 2025-10-08 (Learning from Week 7-8 MCP integration)
**Status**: Production Protocol

---

## Overview

When adding a new MCP server to DA Agent Hub, follow this comprehensive protocol to ensure the MCP server is properly integrated into the specialist and role agent ecosystem.

---

## Phase 1: MCP Server Setup & Validation (2-3 hours)

### Step 1: Configure MCP Server
**Location**: `.claude/mcp.json`

**Actions**:
- [ ] Add MCP server configuration with authentication
- [ ] Configure security restrictions (read-only by default when possible)
- [ ] Set up credential management (1Password environment variables)
- [ ] Test MCP server connection (`claude mcp list`)

**Example**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "new-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["package-name"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "${NEW_MCP_TOKEN}",
        "READ_ONLY": "true"
      },
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Step 2: Research MCP Server Tools
**Duration**: 1-2 hours (depending on server complexity)

**Actions**:
- [ ] Inventory all available MCP tools
- [ ] Document tool parameters and usage
- [ ] Identify security considerations
- [ ] Test critical tools (3-5 most common operations)
- [ ] Document known issues and limitations
- [ ] Assign confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

**Output**: Create comprehensive documentation
**Location**: `knowledge/mcp-servers/<server-name>/`

**Contents**:
- Tool inventory with descriptions
- Authentication and security notes
- Usage examples for common operations
- Known issues and workarounds
- Confidence scoring

---

### Step 3: Validate MCP Tools
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes

**Actions**:

- [ ] Update confidence scores based on testing

**Output**: Validation report
**Location**: `projects/active/.../WEEK*_MCP_VALIDATION.md`

---

## Phase 2: Specialist Agent Integration (1-2 hours)

### Step 4: Update Specialist Agent(s)
**Identify which specialists need this MCP server**

**Actions**:
- [ ] Add MCP tool inventory to specialist agent file
- [ ] Document tool selection framework (when to use which tool)
- [ ] Add MCP recommendation pattern examples
- [ ] Include security notes and authentication
- [ ] Add confidence levels for each tool category
- [ ] Document integration patterns with other MCP servers

**Location**: `.claude/agents/specialists/<specialist-name>.md`

**Section to Add**:
```markdown
## MCP Tools

### <server-name> Tools

**Tool Category 1** (X tools):
- tool_name_1: Description, confidence level
- tool_name_2: Description, confidence level

**Tool Category 2** (Y tools):
- tool_name_3: Description, confidence level

### Tool Selection Framework
- Use tool_1 when: [criteria]
- Use tool_2 when: [criteria]

### MCP Recommendation Pattern
[Example of how specialist recommends MCP tool usage]

### Confidence Levels
| Tool Category | Confidence | Notes |
|---------------|------------|-------|
| Category 1 | HIGH (0.92) | Production-validated |
| Category 2 | MEDIUM (0.70) | Requires validation |

### Security Notes
- Authentication: [method]
- Restrictions: [read-only, permissions]
- Known issues: [workarounds]
```

---

## Phase 3: Role Agent Integration (1-2 hours)

### Step 5: Identify Affected Role Agents
**Determine which roles should have direct access vs specialist delegation**

**Questions to answer**:
- Which roles work in this domain regularly? (direct access)
- Which roles occasionally need this tool? (specialist delegation)
- What's the confidence threshold for direct use? (typically ≥0.85)

**Examples**:
- dbt-mcp: analytics-engineer (direct), bi-developer (minimal), others (delegate)
- aws-api: data-engineer (minimal), ui-ux (delegate only)
- slack-mcp: project-manager (heavy), business-analyst (moderate)

---

### Step 6: Update Role Agents
**For each affected role agent**

**Actions**:
- [ ] Add MCP Tool Access section (if not exists)
- [ ] Document primary MCP servers for this role
- [ ] Define "When to Use MCP Tools Directly" (confidence ≥0.85)
- [ ] Define "When to Delegate to Specialists" (confidence <0.60)
- [ ] Add usage examples (copy-paste ready)
- [ ] Update "When to Handle Directly" checklist (add simple MCP queries)

**Location**: `.claude/agents/roles/<role-name>.md`

**Template**:
```markdown
## MCP Tool Access

### Primary MCP Servers
**Direct Access**: <server-name>, [other servers]
**Purpose**: [What role uses these MCP tools for]

### When to Use MCP Tools Directly (Confidence ≥0.85)

**<server-name>** ([Usage Level: Heavy/Moderate/Minimal]):
- ✅ Tool 1: Common operation description
- ✅ Tool 2: Common operation description

**Example**:
[Copy-paste ready code example]

### When to Delegate to Specialists (Confidence <0.60 OR Complex Operations)

**<specialist-name>** ([Domain]):
- ❌ Complex operation type 1
- ❌ Complex operation type 2
```

---

## Phase 4: Documentation & Patterns (2-3 hours)

### Step 7: Create Quick Reference Card
**Purpose**: Fast lookup for common MCP tool operations

**Actions**:
- [ ] Create quick reference card
- [ ] Document most common operations (80/20 principle)
- [ ] Add 3-5 common workflows
- [ ] Include troubleshooting guide (common issues)
- [ ] Add confidence levels
- [ ] Document when to delegate to specialist

**Location**: `.claude/skills/reference-knowledge/<server-name>-quick-reference/SKILL.md`

**Structure**:
