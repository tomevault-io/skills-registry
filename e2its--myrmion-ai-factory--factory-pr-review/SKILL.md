description: Factory PR Review — six-axis review (code, code↔docs, API contracts, ADR, traceability, complexity) wired as a PUSH GATE (preflight before `git push`) and an assistive PR reviewer for already-pushed branches. Maps blockers to framework Hard Gates (CIP, CVP, IPP, BVL, GCRP) + DC-28 cyclomatic complexity. Use when: a Bash `git push` is about to fire (auto-invoked by hook) OR the user explicitly asks to review a branch / open PR. Use when this capability is needed.

# Factory PR Review — Push Gate + Assistive Reviewer

> **Shared Protocol** — Referenced by: ALL agents that ship code (IMPLEMENT, QA, DEVOPS, CODESIGN/BLUEPRINT for spec-bearing PRs) + the `check-push-preflight.sh` hook.
> Position in the SDLC: runs **immediately before `git push`** as a local quality gate. Does NOT replace human review on the PR — it complements it by catching blockers before they hit the PR.

## Why a push gate, not a merge gate

A merge gate (CI on PR) is too late: the work is already on the remote, the author has context-switched, and reviewers waste a round trip on findings the author could have caught locally. The push gate runs against `origin/{base}..HEAD`, exits non-zero on hard-blockers, and produces the same finding catalog the post-push review would. The assistive `--review {PR}` mode is kept for already-open PRs (ad-hoc review, second opinion, pre-merge final pass).

Hard-blocker exit semantics:
- exit 0 → no blockers, push proceeds
- exit 1 → blockers found, push blocked with humanised findings
- exit 2 → tooling failure (missing dep, repo state error) — NOT a blocker, push proceeds with warning

## When this skill activates

| Trigger | Mode | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| `Bash` tool with command containing `git push` (and current branch is non-protected, non-empty diff vs base) | `--preflight` | `.claude/hooks/check-push-preflight.sh` (auto) |
| User: "review PR #N" / GitHub PR URL / "review this branch before push" | `--review` (or `--preflight` for unpushed branch) | manual skill invocation |
| User explicitly invokes `/pr-review` slash command (when materialised) | per-flag | manual |

The push hook is the **default integration**. Manual invocation is for the assistive cases.

## Operation modes

### Mode 1 — `--preflight` (push gate, default)

Runs locally against the current branch's diff vs its base. NEVER touches the remote. NEVER posts to a PR.

```bash
.claude/skills/factory-pr-review/scripts/preflight.sh [--base origin/main] [--json]
```

Steps (executed by `preflight.sh`):
1. Resolve base (`origin/main` by default, or read from `.claude/rules/branching.md` `default_base_branch`).
2. Compute `git diff --name-only origin/{base}..HEAD`.
3. **Docs-only fast-lane** — if every changed path matches `**/*.md`, `docs/**`, `.context/templates/**`, `.gitignore` (and none under `.github/workflows/**`), exit 0 with `fast-lane: docs-only` note. Skip remaining checks.
4. Run `detect_change_type.py` → flags JSON.
5. Run `check_docs_sync.py --git-range origin/{base}..HEAD --json` → docs findings.
6. If any `docs/spec/*/dev_plan.md` in diff, run `check_dev_plan_task_format.py --git-range origin/{base}..HEAD --json` → IMPLEMENT plan task-format findings (orphan `### X.N` h3 vs canonical `- [ ] [X.N]` checkbox; `status: READY` plans with zero unchecked tasks).
7. If `has_openapi: true`, run `check_openapi_diff.sh origin/{base} <spec-path>`.
8. If `has_asyncapi: true`, run `check_asyncapi_diff.sh origin/{base} <spec-path>`.
9. **Framework-aware checks** (run unconditionally — see § Framework-aware Hard Blocks below).
10. Aggregate findings; print summary; exit 1 if any blocker, 0 otherwise.

### Mode 2 — `--review {PR-URL or branch}`

Full audit against an open PR (or local branch). Produces the structured review (`assets/review_template.md`) and OPTIONALLY posts via `post_review.py` (only with explicit user confirmation — see Phase 6).

## Framework-aware Hard Blocks

These extend the generic hard blocks (`SKILL.md` Phase 4 in the upstream skill) with framework-specific gates. ALL apply universally; some are scoped to materialised projects vs the framework meta repo.

| # | Block | Scope | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Public endpoint modified without spec change | both | `references/api-contract-rules.md` |
| 2 | Breaking change without major bump or migration note | both | `references/api-contract-rules.md` |
| 3 | Secrets in diff (regex patterns) | both | `scripts/detect_change_type.py` |
| 4 | High-severity security vulnerability (SQLi, RCE, auth bypass, persistent XSS) | both | `references/code-review-criteria.md` § 4 |
| 5 | Tests deleted without justification in PR description | both | `references/code-review-criteria.md` § 1 |
| 6 | Irreversible DB migrations without rollback script | downstream | `references/code-review-criteria.md` § SQL |
| 7 | **CIP violation**: new code artifact without `config/codebase_inventory.json` consultation | downstream | `factory-codebase-inventory/SKILL.md` |
| 8 | **CVP violation**: spec-bearing change with broken upstream traceability (spec.feature ↔ user_journey ↔ slice_map ↔ design ↔ test_plan ↔ dev_plan ↔ increment_plan) | downstream | `factory-coherence-validation/SKILL.md` |
| 9 | **IPP violation**: governance artifact written fully-formed on first write | both | `factory-incremental-persistence/SKILL.md` (covered by `check-ipp-compliance.sh` PreToolUse — push gate re-asserts as defence in depth) |
| 10 | **Branch-protection drift**: branch name does not match an allowed working pattern (`feature/EVOL-*`, `feature/{ID}-*`, `fix/*`, `bugfix/*`, `hotfix/*`, `docs/*`, `chore/*`) | both | `factory-branching-strategy/SKILL.md` |
| 11 | **Governance-bump miss** (framework meta only): change touches a file tracked in `.context/templates/setup/governance_versions.json` but the manifest does NOT change in the same diff | meta only | CLAUDE.md § Generation Standards #2 |
| 12 | **Protected-code modified**: diff touches a path listed in `config/protected-paths.json` OR a region between `PROTECTED-CODE START/END` markers | downstream | constitution.md + `config/protected-paths.json` |
| 13 | **Reference coherence**: rename in diff (skill/rule/instruction/command/path/heading) without lock-step propagation to mention sites — broken markdown links, divergent identifier spellings, anchor pointers to non-existent headings | both | Phase 0 Coherence Audit + `config/coherence-context.json` |
| 14 | **Placeholder leakage**: `{{X}}` token outside `audit.placeholder_allowlist_paths`. Meta allows under `.context/templates/**` only; downstream defaults to no allowlist (any `{{X}}` is a finding) | both | Phase 0 + `config/coherence-context.json` |
| 15 | **Manifest ↔ disk coherence**: `governance_versions.json` entry pointing to a path that does not exist OR file change without manifest entry update in the same diff. Inverse of Block 11 plus the disk-side check | both | Phase 0 + `config/coherence-context.json` + manifest path |
| 16-meta | **Meta ↔ template lock-step**: `.claude/X` changed without mirror at `.context/templates/setup/claude/X` (or vice-versa). Source of truth: `audit.lock_step_pairs` of type `meta_template_mirror` | meta only | Phase 0 + `config/coherence-context.json` |
| 16-downstream | **Code ↔ docs lock-step**: public artefact added/removed/renamed without catalog/index update in CLAUDE.md, docs/, or referenced rule/instruction files. Source of truth: `audit.lock_step_pairs` of type `rename_propagation` and `code_doc_lock_step` | downstream only | Phase 0 + `config/coherence-context.json` |
| 17 | **Commit ↔ diff coherence**: commit message claims a change that the diff does not show, or the diff carries a structural change the commit message omits (e.g. EVOL-N in commit ≠ branch's EVOL-N; new public field shipped under `chore:` prefix) | both | Phase 0 (semantic judgment) |
| 18 | **Bump severity ↔ change kind coherence**: `governance_versions.json` bump kind (PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR) does not match the actual nature of the diff (new feature → MINOR; breaking contract → MAJOR; bug fix only → PATCH). Inverse cross-check of Generation Standards §2 | both | Phase 0 (semantic judgment) |
| 19 | **Cyclomatic complexity exceeds project threshold** (DC-28): one or more functions in the diff have CCN above `config/quality.json.complexity.thresholds.hard`. Blocker only when `complexity.pr_blocker=true`; otherwise classified Important (soft) / Nit (advisory) per `factory-complexity-check` skill output. Fail-open when MCP unavailable, config absent, or `complexity.enabled=false` | both | `config/quality.json` + `factory-complexity-check/SKILL.md` (axis 6) |

Block 11 (Governance-bump miss) is the framework-meta equivalent of "missing CHANGELOG entry". It enforces the rule that lives in the root `CLAUDE.md` Generation Standards §2.

Blocks 13-18 are produced by **Phase 0 Coherence Audit** (semantic, agentic). 13-15 are deterministic-leaning but require the agent to interpret rename intent and lock-step pair semantics; 16 is split by context (one variant active per repo); 17-18 require semantic judgment over commit message + manifest bump kind. All six read their context-specific configuration from `config/coherence-context.json` (`audit.*` keys).

Block 19 (Cyclomatic complexity) is produced by **axis 6** in Phase 3 (per-axis analysis). The skill `factory-complexity-check` invokes a project-configured MCP (default Semgrep, RDR-ratified at SETUP Q23.1) on the cumulative branch diff; severity routing depends on `config/quality.json.complexity.pr_blocker` (default `false` → advisory). The skill fails open — missing config, unavailable MCP, or unparseable response degrade to a banner-only advisory.

## Framework artefact ↔ docs sync matrix

Extends `references/docs-sync-checklist.md` with the framework's own artefacts. Only applies to materialised projects (the meta repo has no `docs/spec/` tree).

| Code change | Artefact that must update | Severity if missing |
|---|---|---|
| New / modified Gherkin scenario in `docs/spec/{ID}/` | `user_journey.md` + `test_plan.md` (CVP Check 1, 2) | **Blocker** |
| New / modified design contract operation | `design.md` § Contracts + OpenAPI/AsyncAPI under `contracts/` | **Blocker** |
| New / modified test_plan case | `dev_plan.md` task tags reference the case | Important |
| `slicing_strategy: incremental` feature ships without `slice_map.md` APPROVED | (CVP Check 0d slice_map_presence) | **Blocker** for a NEW feature (no increment_plan yet); WARNING for a legacy pre-EVOL-036 feature already carrying increment_plan (grandfathered — Check 0d) |
| `slicing_strategy: incremental` feature ships without `increment_plan.md` APPROVED | (CVP Check 0c) | **Blocker** |
| `INC-N` `cascade_source` does not resolve to a real slice, or a slice is unrealized | (CVP Check 18 slice_to_increment_coverage) | **Blocker** |
| Re-slice moves a MERGED-frozen scenario out of its owning slice | (CVP Check 20 slice_immutability_consistency) | **Blocker** |
| Code change inside an `INC-N` MERGED scope (immutability) | (Per-Increment Immutability) | **Blocker** |
| New `INC-N` without `depends_on:` field in § 1 | `increment_plan.md` § 1 `depends_on:` (canonical DAG) | Important |
| `feature.scope` ≠ scope of touched paths (full-stack vs frontend-only vs backend-only) | (Scope Compatibility Gate) | **Blocker** |

## Workflow (`--preflight`)

### Phase 0 — Coherence Audit (agentic, semantic)

Runs BEFORE all other phases when the diff is **governance-sensitive** (touches any path under `audit.root_sets` of `config/coherence-context.json`, minus `audit.exclusions`). For non-sensitive diffs (e.g. pure UI under `src/components/`, build-tooling-only), Phase 0 is skipped — go straight to Phase 1.

The audit is performed by the agent (Claude), NOT by a deterministic script. Reason: rename intent, lock-step semantics, commit↔diff coherence, and bump-severity judgment all require contextual reasoning that regex/grep cannot reliably perform without false negatives. The deterministic phases (1-6) stay deterministic and cheap; Phase 0 is the one phase that pays a model-call cost in exchange for completeness.

**Scope discipline**: Phase 0 reads ONLY (a) files in the diff and (b) files in the **collateral set** built in Step 0.3. It NEVER scans the whole repo. The collateral set is bounded by `audit.root_sets` minus `audit.exclusions`.

**Execution split**: Phase 0 has two sides. Steps 0.1–0.5 are **agent-side** (LLM judgment) — the agent reads `config/coherence-context.json`, runs `git grep` for collateral, applies the six detectors, and emits the marker. Step 0 inside `preflight.sh` is **script-side** (deterministic verification) — it only reads the marker and decides whether to block, never executes the audit itself. The agent is responsible for running Phase 0 before pushing; the push gate fails closed if the marker is absent. Trigger entry points for the agent: when the user asks "review this branch" / "audit before push" / explicitly invokes the factory-pr-review SKILL — the agent recognises the SKILL description match and runs Phase 0.1–0.5 inline.

#### Step 0.0 — Skip checks
- Detached HEAD or protected branch → skip with note (defence-in-depth, not Phase 0's concern).
- Diff matches the docs-only fast-lane (CLAUDE.md Generation Standards §3) → skip Phase 0; existing fast-lane handles.
- `config/coherence-context.json` missing → emit humanised warning, treat as `downstream` with empty allowlists, continue.

#### Step 0.1 — Load context
Read `config/coherence-context.json`. Parse:
- `context` → `meta` | `downstream`. Selects which Block 16 variant is active and which lock-step pair types apply.
- `audit.root_sets` → directories the audit is allowed to scan when expanding to collateral.
- `audit.exclusions` → globs globally excluded.
- `audit.placeholder_allowlist_paths` → globs where `{{X}}` is permitted (Block 14).
- `audit.lock_step_pairs` → typed declarations driving Block 16 (`meta_template_mirror` for meta; `rename_propagation` + `code_doc_lock_step` for downstream).
- `audit.manifest_paths` → manifest location for Blocks 15/18.

#### Step 0.2 — Extract changed symbols from the diff
Run `git diff --name-status origin/{base}..HEAD` and `git log --format=%B origin/{base}..HEAD`. Extract:
- **Renamed paths** — git rename detection (`R{score}` entries).
- **Deleted paths** — files that disappeared.
- **Moved/renamed identifiers** — section headings changed in `.md` files (`-## OldName` paired with `+## NewName`); `name:` field changes in skill frontmatter; function/class definitions removed/added with similar names.
- **Public artefact names** — Factory-* skill names, rule names (basename of `.claude/rules/*.instructions.md`), instruction names, command names, hook script names.

Each extracted symbol → search term for Step 0.3.

#### Step 0.3 — Build collateral set
For each symbol from 0.2, run `git grep -l <symbol>` constrained to `audit.root_sets` minus `audit.exclusions`. Files that match AND are NOT in the diff = collateral set. Read those files in full. The set is naturally bounded — typical EVOLs touch ≤ 5 symbols and ≤ 30 collateral files.

#### Step 0.4 — Apply detectors 13-18
Run each detector against `diff ∪ collateral`. Routing:

| Detector | Inputs | Verdict cues |
|---|---|---|
| 13 Reference coherence | renames + collateral mentions | mention site uses old name → 🔴 Blocker; mention site uses new name → ✅; ambiguous (legitimate historical mention) → ❓ Question with proof of intentionality |
| 14 Placeholder leakage | diff files + `audit.placeholder_allowlist_paths` | `{{X}}` outside allowlist → 🔴 Blocker; inside allowlist → ✅ |
| 15 Manifest ↔ disk | manifest at `audit.manifest_paths.primary` + diff path list | manifest entry whose target does not exist → 🔴 Blocker; tracked file changed without manifest bump (in same diff) → 🔴 Blocker (Block 11 already covers this for meta — Block 15 is the inverse-direction check) |
| 16-meta | diff paths + `lock_step_pairs[type=meta_template_mirror]` | left changed without right (or vice versa) → 🔴 Blocker; both changed (or neither) → ✅ |
| 16-downstream | diff paths + `lock_step_pairs[type=rename_propagation, code_doc_lock_step]` | rename without propagation to scan_targets → 🔴 Blocker; new artefact without catalog entry → 🔴 Blocker; modified artefact without doc update → 🟡 Important |
| 17 Commit ↔ diff | commit message bodies + diff content | commit claims feature X but diff is refactor only → 🔴 Blocker; EVOL-N in commit ≠ branch's EVOL-N → 🔴 Blocker; diff carries new public field but commit prefix is `chore:` → 🟡 Important |
| 18 Bump severity ↔ change kind | manifest bump entries + diff content | new feature → manifest entry should be MINOR or higher (PATCH on additive feature → 🔴 Blocker); breaking contract change → MAJOR (MINOR on breaking → 🔴 Blocker); pure bug fix → PATCH (over-bump is 🟡 Important, not blocker) |

Each finding cites file/line/snippet/why/fix per the existing severity rubric (`references/severity-rubric.md`).

#### Step 0.5 — Emit marker
After Phase 0 completes (regardless of verdict count), write a marker file:

```
.claude/state/coherence-audit-${branch_sha}.marker
```

- `branch_sha` = `git rev-parse HEAD` at audit time.
- The agent MUST `mkdir -p .claude/state/` before writing — the directory is `.gitignore`d and may not exist on a fresh clone or after a state cleanup.

Marker body (JSON, single line):
```json
{"branch_sha":"...","audited_at":"ISO-8601","governance_sensitive":true,"findings":{"blocker":N,"important":N,"nit":N,"question":N}}
```

The marker proves Phase 0 ran for this exact tree state (commit sha). New commit → new sha → marker invalidated → audit must re-run. Same code state across sessions reuses the marker — re-auditing identical bytes is wasted work.

#### Step 0.6 — Verdict
- Any 🔴 Blocker → STOP. Surface findings to user with humanised resolution path. Do NOT write marker (or write marker with `"blocker": >0` and let preflight.sh refuse to proceed).
- 0 🔴, any 🟡/🟢/❓ → write marker with finding counts; advise user on the non-blocker findings; proceed to Phase 1.
- 0 findings → write marker; proceed to Phase 1 silently.

### Phase 1 — Branch + base resolution
```bash
current=$(git branch --show-current)
base=${BASE:-origin/main}  # or read from .claude/rules/branching.md
git fetch origin "${base#origin/}" --quiet
git diff --name-only "$base"..HEAD
```

If `current` is empty (detached HEAD) OR equals a protected branch name (`main`, `master`, `develop`, bare `hotfix`, `release/*`) → exit 2 with "preflight skipped: not on a working branch".

### Phase 2 — Change classification
Run `scripts/detect_change_type.py --git-range "$base"..HEAD --check-secrets`. The flags drive which references the agent loads when surfacing findings.

### Phase 3 — Per-axis analysis
Apply this routing table (load reference + run script):

| Active flag | Load reference | Run script |
|---|---|---|
| `has_code` | `references/code-review-criteria.md` | — |
| `has_openapi` | `references/api-contract-rules.md` | `scripts/check_openapi_diff.sh` |
| `has_asyncapi` | `references/api-contract-rules.md` | `scripts/check_asyncapi_diff.sh` |
| any code or public-facing | `references/docs-sync-checklist.md` | `scripts/check_docs_sync.py` |
| `is_breaking_candidate` or `has_dependencies` | `references/adr-policy.md` | — |
| always | `references/changelog-policy.md` | — |
| always | `references/severity-rubric.md` | — |
| framework meta repo | governance-bump check (Block 11) | grep `governance_versions.json` in diff |
| `has_code` AND `config/quality.json` present | axis 6 — `factory-complexity-check/SKILL.md` | INVOKE_SKILL("factory-complexity-check", { files: changed_source_files }) |

### Phase 4 — Hard-block enforcement
The 19 hard blocks in § Framework-aware Hard Blocks. Each one is a deterministic pass/fail. The agent does NOT downgrade these — they are blocks by definition of the rubric.

### Phase 5 — Review generation
Use `assets/review_template.md` for the JSON structure. In `--preflight` mode the review is printed locally; in `--review` mode it is rendered to Markdown via `post_review.py`.

Required structure (severity buckets):
1. Summary (2-3 sentences) — what the change does + verdict.
2. 🔴 Blockers — push-blocking. File/line/snippet/why/fix per item.
3. 🟡 Important — should be fixed; doesn't block push.
4. 🟢 Nits — author decides.
5. ❓ Questions — legitimate doubts.
6. 👏 Praise — what's well done.
7. 📋 Documentation checklist (from `references/docs-sync-checklist.md`).
8. 🔧 Mitigations applied (only when non-empty — see Phase 5.5).

### Phase 5.5 — Mitigation hot-fix (`--review` mode only, optional)

When the audit catches a clear-cut blocker that the reviewer can fix mechanically, the reviewer MAY apply the fix to the PR branch and record it in `mitigations_applied[]` instead of leaving the finding open. This shifts the resolution from "ask the author" to "show the author what was done" while preserving the audit trail.

Eligibility (ALL must hold):

1. **Mechanical fix** — unambiguous resolution (replace pattern X with Y; add missing manifest entry; sync byte-identical mirror file). No design choice, no stylistic preference.
2. **Clear-cut category** — security regex hit; broken reference; lock-step drift; manifest↔disk drift; placeholder leakage; missing test for new logic with obvious test pattern.
3. **High confidence** — reviewer can verify locally (tests pass, linter clean, build green).
4. **Same branch** — commit lands on the PR branch, not on a separate fix-branch.

If any criterion fails, leave the finding open in Blockers/Important and let the author decide. Mitigations are contributions, not overrides — the author always retains the option to revert.

Workflow:

1. Apply the fix. Commit to the PR branch with a Conventional Commits message: `fix(EVOL-NNN): {what was fixed} (review mitigation)` or similar attribution.
2. Run any relevant verification locally (tests, lint, build). Capture the verification evidence.
3. Push the commit to the PR branch (the push gate Phase 0 may re-fire — that's expected; re-audit if so).
4. Add an entry to `mitigations_applied[]` in the review JSON: `finding_ref` cites the original finding (`blockers[N]` or `important[N]`); `commit_sha` is the resolution commit's full SHA; `description` summarises what was done; `verified_by` cites evidence.
5. The corresponding entry in `blockers[]` / `important[]` STAYS — do not delete it. The author needs to see both the finding and the resolution.
6. `decision` SHOULD remain `comment` (not `approve`) when mitigations were applied — author must confirm acceptance.

If mitigation breaks something else (verification fails), revert the mitigation commit, leave the finding open, and explain in `description` what was attempted and why it failed.

### Phase 6 — Publication (`--review` mode only)
Use `scripts/post_review.py` to publish on the platform. **NEVER** without explicit user confirmation — an incorrect review on GitHub is publicly visible. The push-gate (`--preflight`) NEVER publishes.

The script is **dry-run by default**: invoked without flags it only renders and prints the review. Publishing requires the explicit `--publish` flag, which the agent adds ONLY after the user has confirmed the rendered output. The review body is sanitised (control characters stripped) and passed to the platform CLI via `--body-file`, never inline through argv.

When `mitigations_applied[]` is non-empty, `post_review.py` renders a "🔧 Mitigations applied during review" section after Findings, citing each mitigation's commit SHA + description + evidence. The author sees finding + resolution in a single comment.

## Review principles

- **Severity over volume**: 3 real blockers > 30 nits.
- **Approve if it improves codebase health**, even if not perfect.
- **Ask before stating** when unsure: "Is it intentional that…?" beats "This is wrong".
- **Cite evidence**: line number, code snippet, command to reproduce. "I think there's a problem in X" doesn't cut it.
- **Be specific with proposals**: "consider using X" beats "this could be improved".
- **Don't duplicate what a linter catches**. If ESLint/Ruff/golangci-lint will flag it, it's not human review work.
- **Don't comment style if a formatter exists** (Prettier, Black, gofmt). The formatter wins.

## Iron law: don't claim without verifying

Before flagging a finding as a verified blocker, the skill MUST be able to show:
- The exact file and line.
- The actual code snippet (not paraphrased).
- An explanation of **why** it's a problem in THIS codebase (not generic).
- A concrete fix proposal.

If you can't verify one of these four points, downgrade to "Question".

## PR Persistence Contract — MANDATORY

After EVERY review cycle (preflight blocker resolution, manual `--review`, `/loop pr review` iteration — **including zero-finding clean first-pass**), the agent MUST post a structured comment to the PR that captures the cycle state. Chat sessions disappear; the PR is the durable audit record. **No silent passes — green is a deliberate verification result that MUST surface on the PR.**

### When to post

Always. Per cycle, exactly one comment:

- `--preflight` mode (blockers resolved): post after the fix lands.
- `--review {PR}` mode: post per run.
- `/loop pr review` iteration: post per iteration regardless of finding count.
- Clean first-pass (no findings, CI green out of the gate): post a green-state confirmation comment naming every gate that passed. The reader MUST be able to see that verification ran and concluded clean — silence is indistinguishable from "nobody checked".

### What to include

The comment MUST contain:

1. **Exit state table** — every gate state at the cycle end. Minimum rows: `mergeStateStatus`, CI workflow status (per check), `preflight.sh` findings count, Phase 0 detector summary (or `skipped — docs-only fast-lane` when applicable), governance-script local results (`validate-governance.sh`, `check-applicability-frontmatter.sh`, `check-iteration-id-format.sh`, `check-adr-constitution-sync.sh`, and any project-specific gates), Phase 0 marker file path (or N/A).
2. **Per-iteration root-cause block** — for each iteration that produced findings: symptom (what failed and where), root cause (the underlying bug, not just the surface error), fix (commit SHA + one-line description + manifest bump if any), verification (which local check + which CI run confirms green). Clean first-pass iterations skip this block (no symptoms to report) but MUST still produce the exit state table.
3. **Phase 0 detectors table** — explicit per-detector result (13 Reference coherence / 14 Placeholder leakage / 15 Manifest↔disk / 16-meta or 16-downstream Lock-step / 17 Commit↔diff / 18 Bump severity). When Phase 0 was skipped, render one row stating `Phase 0 skipped — docs-only fast-lane per SKILL.md § Phase 0 Step 0.0`. Mark false-positive questions with `❓` + brief justification.
4. **Branch history** — table mapping each commit SHA on the branch to its commit subject. Anchors the comment to git ground truth.
5. **Stale-signal disclaimer** — if earlier `github-actions[bot]` failure comments exist on the PR, explicitly call them out as historical so reviewers don't act on them. Omit when no stale signals exist.

### Format

- Markdown.
- Top-level heading:
  - `## 🔁 PR-Review Loop — Iteration Log` for `/loop` cycles with at least one iteration that had findings.
  - `## ✅ PR-Review Loop — Clean First-Pass` for `/loop` cycles where every iteration was zero-finding green.
  - `## 🔍 PR-Review — Manual Audit` for `--review` mode.
- Tables for everything that can be tabular (state, detectors, branch history).
- Link every commit SHA to `../commit/{sha}`. Link every CI run to its job URL.
- Code blocks for command outputs that justify a verdict (e.g. the `diff` that proves lock-step is restored).
- Trailer: `🤖 Generated by /loop pr review cycle (Claude Code)` (or `--review` variant).

### Implementation

Posted via `gh pr comment <PR> --body "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"`. The skill consumer is responsible for the heredoc; the SKILL itself does not ship a script for this (the content is per-cycle and not templatable beyond the headings).

### When this rule applies

Universal — both `meta` and `downstream` contexts. Every PR that any review-cycle mode touches gets exactly one comment per cycle. No carve-outs.

### Why

Without persisting the analysis on the PR, the chain "I saw a failure → I diagnosed → I fixed → I verified" — OR the chain "I verified, everything clean" — lives only in the chat transcript. Reviewers who arrive later have no way to distinguish "no findings because nobody checked" from "no findings because the cycle ran and confirmed clean". The PR comment is the framework's institutional memory for review-cycle work; explicit green-state confirmation is part of that memory.

## Integration with other Factory protocols

| Protocol | Interaction |
|---|---|
| `factory-branching-strategy` | Push gate is downstream of the Pre-Action Gate. Does NOT re-validate branch creation; assumes the branch exists and is non-protected. Reads `default_base_branch` from `.claude/rules/branching.md`. |
| `factory-codebase-inventory` (CIP) | Block 7 maps directly to CIP Canary; preflight checks for new code artefacts that are not registered in `config/codebase_inventory.json`. |
| `factory-coherence-validation` (CVP) | Block 8 invokes a subset of CVP checks (0a/0c/0d/1/2/13-20) when `docs/spec/{ID}/**` is touched — the `0d/18/19/20` slice checks (EVOL-036) give the local push preflight parity with BLUEPRINT --approve. Full CVP runs at BLUEPRINT --approve / IMPLEMENT --plan / QA --verify; preflight runs the cheap subset locally. |
| `factory-incremental-persistence` (IPP) | Block 9 is already enforced by `check-ipp-compliance.sh` at PreToolUse Write. Preflight re-asserts as defence in depth (in case the file was created outside Claude). |
| `factory-build-verification` (BVL) | Preflight does NOT re-run BVL (tests already passed at `IMPLEMENT --build`). It checks that test files are not deleted and that new logic has accompanying tests (heuristic). |
| `factory-governance-loading` (GCRP) | Block 11 (governance-bump miss, meta only) enforces the same rule as GCRP § Governance Write Protocol (GWP). Preflight computes the diff against `governance_versions.json` and blocks if a tracked file changed without a manifest update. |
| `factory-commit-prompt` | Preflight runs AFTER commit (push time), so commit messages are immutable at this point. Validates Conventional Commits format on the new commits in `origin/{base}..HEAD`. |

## Per-context behaviour

### Framework meta repo (this repo)
- Block 11 (governance-bump miss) is **active**.
- Blocks 7-8-12 are **inactive** (no `docs/spec/`, no `codebase_inventory.json`, no `protected-paths.json` in the meta — the framework IS the protected code, governed by Block 11 instead).
- Docs-only fast-lane allowlist matches CLAUDE.md Generation Standards §3 verbatim.

### Materialised projects (downstream)
- All 12 blocks active.
- Docs-only fast-lane only when the project's own `CLAUDE.md` declares it (defaults to OFF).
- `config/protected-paths.json` consulted for Block 12.
- `docs/spec/{ID}/` artefacts drive Block 8 (CVP subset).

## Hook wiring (push gate)

`.claude/settings.json` (and template counterpart) registers a PreToolUse hook on `Bash`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash .claude/hooks/check-push-preflight.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook script reads stdin JSON, extracts `tool_input.command`, matches `/(^|\s|;|&&|\|\|)git\s+push(\s|$)/`, and on match runs `scripts/preflight.sh`. Non-`git push` commands pass through unchanged. Hard-blockers cause the hook to exit 1 with a humanised message; the agent sees the block and reports it to the user instead of the raw script output.

## Project rules and ADR precedence — MANDATORY

The skill is framework code; it ships identical to every project. **Project-specific behaviour comes from project rules and ADRs**, NOT from skill defaults.

> **Scope note.** This skill is the **push gate**. It is NOT the inline 🔍 REVIEW hat that runs during `IMPLEMENT --build` (DEV ↔ REVIEW ↔ SEC). Those are governed by `.claude/rules/review-policy.md` and live inside the BVL cycle. The push gate is a downstream, independent concern: it runs at `git push` time on the cumulative branch diff, regardless of what happened during IMPLEMENT.

### Hierarchy (highest to lowest, on conflict)

1. **`docs/constitution.md`** — project constitution. The Hard-Gate categories (CIP, CVP, IPP, BVL, GCRP) are constitutional and cannot be disabled.
2. **ADRs and FDRs** — `docs/project_log/adr/*.md` (project-wide ADRs that amend constitution.md via `factory-adr-management` Accept Procedure) and `docs/spec/{ID}/fdr/*.md` (feature-scoped FDRs; legacy `docs/spec/{ID}/adr/*.md` is read until projects migrate). They may refine, exempt, or extend the rule defaults below; they CANNOT relax constitutional gates.
3. **`.claude/rules/*.instructions.md`** — materialised at SETUP, evolved via ADR-backed updates only. These are the operational source of truth for each block category.
4. **Skill defaults** — last-resort fallback when none of the above is present (e.g. fresh project before SETUP --generate completes).

If a project rule disagrees with a skill default, the project rule wins. If an ADR documents a deviation from a project rule, the ADR wins. The skill NEVER imposes its own pattern over a project decision.

### Project rule files consumed by the push gate

Honest, narrow surface — only files the preflight script actually reads (or that drive a hard block deterministically). Everything else lives in the **NOT consumed** section below to prevent scope creep.

| Block / category | Authoritative file | What the push gate reads |
|---|---|---|
| Branch protection (Block 10), base branch | `.claude/rules/branching.md` | `default_base_branch` field (`origin/{x}`); branch-name regex (when present) for Block 10 validation. |
| Protected paths (Block 12) | `config/protected-paths.json` | Glob list — every changed path is matched against it; any match → 🔴 Blocker. |
| Protected code markers | `.claude/rules/protected-code.md` | The `PROTECTED-CODE START/END` marker convention. Push gate scans diff hunks; modifications inside a marker region → 🔴 Blocker. |
| ADR / FDR-driven exemptions | `docs/project_log/adr/*.md` (project-wide ADRs) + `docs/spec/{ID}/fdr/*.md` (feature-scoped FDRs; legacy `adr/` read until migrated) | `pr_review_overrides:` frontmatter (see § ADR / FDR-driven exemptions below). |
| Governance manifest (meta only) | `.context/templates/setup/governance_versions.json` | Existence + diff-touched-without-update check (Block 11, framework meta only). |

That's it. Anything not in this list is NOT consumed. If the push gate were to start consuming a new rule file, that change ships in a new EVOL with explicit manifest entries.

### NOT consumed (different reviewer, different lifecycle)

Same disambiguation pattern as `review-policy.md`:

- `.claude/rules/review-policy.md` — BVL/IMPLEMENT 🔍 REVIEW hat policy (DEV ↔ REVIEW retry loop, escalation, override, environment-driven strictness). Different reviewer, different lifecycle.
- `.claude/rules/security_policy.md` — high-level project security policy (allowed crypto, PII handling, OWASP stance, threat model). Consumed by 🛡️ SEC hat in IMPLEMENT --build (SAST + dependency audit), QA --verify (DAST), and AUDIT (compliance dimension). The push gate's secret-pattern regexes are NOT here — they live in `scripts/detect_change_type.py` and may be extended only via skill changes (manifest-tracked), not via project rules.
- `.claude/rules/testing.md` — testing policy (coverage thresholds, framework choice, AAA pattern). Consumed by BVL during DEV ↔ REVIEW (coverage gate), IMPLEMENT --build (TDD enforcement), QA --verify (test-plan execution). The push gate's "tests-deleted-without-justification" check (Block 5) reads the diff alone, not the policy file.
- `.claude/rules/architecture.md` — layer dependency rules, module boundaries. Consumed by BLUEPRINT (design.md §7.8 Mandatory Patterns), BVL REVIEW hat (Check #1), AUDIT. The push gate does NOT enforce architecture; that is a deeper, design-time concern.
- `.claude/rules/contract-first-policy.md` + `.claude/rules/api-standards.md` — contract authoring + versioning policy. Consumed by BLUEPRINT (CONTRACT-FREEZE gate), `factory-coherence-validation/SKILL.md` (CVP Check 14/15). The push gate's API contract checks (Blocks 1, 2) operate on the **spec files themselves** via oasdiff/asyncapi-cli; the policy text governs how specs are written, not how the push gate reads them.
- `.claude/rules/defect-prevention.md` — DC catalog. Consumed by every SDLC agent listed in each entry's `applicable_to:` field (see CLAUDE.md § Living Governance Catalogs). The push gate is NOT in the consumer list — defect prevention is a design-and-build-time concern, not a push-time one.
- `config/codebase_inventory.json` — component registry. Consumed by `factory-codebase-inventory/SKILL.md` (CIP Canary at IMPLEMENT --build), AUDIT (DRY dimension). Block 7 in this skill (CIP) is a **policy reminder**, not a deterministic check — the push gate does NOT scan the inventory; it relies on the upstream CIP Canary having run during IMPLEMENT --build. If you push code that bypassed CIP Canary (e.g. edited outside Claude), the push gate will not catch it; QA --verify is the next gate.

The pattern: each rule file has ONE primary consumer. Multiple agents may read different slices, but ONE skill or SDLC phase owns the binding-decision authority. The push gate is deliberately narrow — it covers the things that are cheap and deterministic at push time, and defers everything else to its proper owner.

### ADR / FDR-driven exemptions

ADRs (project-wide) and FDRs (feature-scoped) may declare frontmatter exemptions consumed by the push gate:

```yaml
---
status: accepted
date: 2026-04-28
decision-makers: [ARCH]
pr_review_overrides:
  block_1_public_endpoint_without_spec: scoped
  block_1_spec_paths: ["contracts/openapi/v3/*.yaml"]
  block_8_cvp_subset: ["0a", "0c", "1", "2", "13", "14", "15"]   # disable check 16 for this project
---
```

The skill reads `pr_review_overrides:` from every ADR under `docs/project_log/adr/` (project-wide), every FDR under `docs/spec/{ID}/fdr/` (feature-scoped, when the diff is feature-bounded), and any legacy `docs/spec/{ID}/adr/` entries kept for backward compatibility. Project-wide ADRs override skill defaults; FDRs override project-wide rules within the feature scope only. Anything not declared in an override stays at the rule-file default.

A project that wants to disable a check entirely declares it in an ADR (or FDR for feature-scoped exemptions), which is itself reviewed and ratified. There is no per-developer escape hatch — bypassing the gate without an ADR/FDR is a governance-scope violation.

## Customisation (deprecated path)

A project can also create `references/local-policy.md` in its copy of the skill, but this is **deprecated** in favour of the rule + ADR mechanism above. The rule + ADR path is governance-tracked (manifest-bumped, ADR-ratified) whereas a `local-policy.md` is an opaque skill-local override. Use it only for one-off experiments; promote to a rule + ADR before merging to main.
