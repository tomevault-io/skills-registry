# Gnapsis Smoke Test

Run through every gnapsis MCP tool to verify the system is functional. This skill
exercises the full feature set: project setup, taxonomy, entity CRUD, references,
search, subgraph queries, document analysis, validation, and multi-source support.

## Prerequisites

1. Database must be running: `just db-up`
2. gnapsis must be installed: `cargo install --path .`
3. MCP server must be connected: `/mcp`

## Test Procedure

Run each phase sequentially. If any step fails, jump to Phase 10 (Cleanup) to restore
the original config before reporting the failure.
Track entity IDs, reference IDs, and category IDs created during the test for cleanup.

### Phase 0: Config Isolation

The smoke test uses a separate project name (`gnapsis_smoke_test`) so it gets its own
graph and does not interfere with the real project data.

**0.1** Backup the real config:
```bash
cp .gnapsis.toml .gnapsis.toml.bak
```

**0.2** Overwrite `.gnapsis.toml` with the smoke test config:
```toml
# Force local database — overrides global ~/.config/gnapsis/config.toml
[postgres]
uri = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/gnapsis_dev"

[embedding]
provider = "fastembed"
model = "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5"
dimensions = 384

[project]
name = "smoke_test"

[[project.sources]]
id = "default"
path = "<absolute path to this repo>"

[[project.sources]]
id = "vault"
path = "<absolute path to vault source from the backup>"
```
Copy the source paths from the backup file. The key differences are:
- `[postgres]` and `[embedding]` force the local Docker database (overrides global config)
- `name = "smoke_test"` creates graph `gnapsis_smoke_test` instead of `gnapsis_gnapsis`

**0.3** Reconnect the MCP server so it picks up the new config: `/mcp`

### Phase 1: Database Reset & Init

**1.1** Drop the smoke test graph so init starts fresh:
```bash
just db-reset
just db-up
```
Wait for the database to be ready before proceeding.

**1.2** Run `init_project` (force: true) and verify:
  - Response includes `db_version` and `graph_version`
  - `applied_db_migrations` is non-empty
  - `applied_graph_migrations` is non-empty
  - `was_initialized` is false (fresh graph)

**1.3** Run `init_project` again (force: false) and verify:
  - `was_initialized` is true
  - `applied_db_migrations` is empty (no new migrations)
  - `applied_graph_migrations` is empty

### Phase 2: Project Overview (Empty State)

**2.1** Run `project_overview` with no optional params and verify:
  - `categories` contains 17 categories across 5 scopes (Domain, Feature, Namespace, Component, Unit)
  - `stats.domains` is 0
  - `stats.features` is 0
  - `stats.namespaces` is 0
  - `stats.components` is 0
  - `stats.units` is 0
  - `stats.references` is 0

**2.2** Run `project_overview` with `include_descriptions: true` and verify:
  - Response structure is the same
  - Descriptions are not truncated

**2.3** Run `project_overview` with `output_format: "toon"` and verify:
  - Response is returned in TOON format

**2.4** Note down the category IDs needed for entity creation:
  - Find the "core" category at Domain scope -> save as `DOMAIN_CAT_ID`
  - Find the "functional" category at Feature scope -> save as `FEATURE_CAT_ID`
  - Find the "struct" category at Component scope -> save as `COMPONENT_CAT_ID`
  - Find the "function" category at Unit scope -> save as `UNIT_CAT_ID`

### Phase 3: Taxonomy

**3.1** Run `create_category` with name "smoke-test", scope "Feature", description "Temporary category for smoke testing"
  - Verify the category is created with an ID -> save as `SMOKE_CAT_ID`

**3.2** Run `project_overview` and verify:
  - The "smoke-test" category appears in the Feature scope
  - Total category count is now 18

### Phase 4: Entity CRUD

#### 4A: Analyze Document (discover symbols)

**4A.1** Run `analyze_document` on `src/config.rs` with `source_id: "default"` to discover symbols
  - Verify `untracked` list contains symbols (e.g., "Config", "ProjectConfig", "Source")
  - Save the untracked symbol names for use in entity creation

  - `commands`: [Add code reference without specifying source_id, document_path "src/config.rs", lsp_symbol "default_source_id"]
  - Verify: reference created with source_id "default" (the default)

### Phase 6: Search & Query

  - Verify: returns a list of changed files with change types
  - Verify: response includes file paths

**8A.2** Run `get_changed_files` with from_sha and to_sha (use HEAD~1 and HEAD):
  - First get HEAD SHA via git
  - Verify: returns files changed in the last commit

#### 8B: Alter References - Update

**8B.1** Run `alter_references` with an Update command on `FEATURE_REF_ID`:
  - Update `start_line` to a new value (e.g., 10)
  - Update `end_line` to a new value (e.g., 50)
  - Verify: update succeeds
  - Verify: response shows the updated reference

**8B.2** Run `alter_references` with Update on text reference `VAULT_REF_ID`:
  - Update `anchor` to "# Updated Anchor"
  - Verify: anchor updated

#### 8C: Alter References - Delete

**8C.1** Attempt to delete a reference that is attached to an entity:
  - Run `alter_references` with Delete on `FEATURE_REF_ID`
  - Expect error: reference is attached to an entity

**8C.2** To test delete success: first create a standalone reference, detach it, then delete:
  - Create a temporary entity with a reference
  - Use `update_entity` with Unattach command to detach the reference
  - Run `alter_references` with Delete on the detached reference
  - Verify: deletion succeeds
  - Clean up the temporary entity

#### 8D: LSP Refresh

**8D.1** Run `lsp_refresh` on `src/config.rs` with source_id "default":
  - Provide LSP symbols from analyze_document (Phase 7.1) untracked list
  - Include at least the symbols that have existing references (e.g., "Config", "ProjectConfig")
  - Verify: `updated_count` shows how many references were refreshed
  - Verify: `updated` array shows old and new line numbers for changed refs
  - Verify: `unmatched_count` shows symbols with no matching reference

### Phase 9: Graph Validation

**9.1** Run `validate_graph` with all checks enabled:
  - `check_orphans`: true
  - `check_cycles`: true
  - `check_scope_violations`: true
  - `check_unclassified`: true
  - `check_no_references`: true
  - Verify: `valid` is true or only has expected issues from test data
  - Verify: `issue_count` matches the sum of all issue arrays

**9.2** Run `validate_graph` with only orphan check:
  - `check_orphans`: true
  - `check_cycles`: false
  - `check_scope_violations`: false
  - `check_unclassified`: false
  - `check_no_references`: false
  - Verify: only `orphans` array may have entries, all others are empty

**9.3** Run `validate_graph` with only cycle check:
  - `check_cycles`: true, all others false
  - Verify: `cycles` is empty (no cycles in test data)

**9.4** Run `validate_graph` with only scope violations check:
  - `check_scope_violations`: true, all others false
  - Verify: no scope violations in test data

### Phase 10: Cleanup

This phase MUST run even if a previous phase failed — it restores the original config.

**10.1** Delete entities in reverse dependency order:
  - Delete `VAULT_FEATURE_ID` (and any temp entities from Phase 8C)
  - Delete `FEATURE_ID`
  - Delete `DOMAIN_ID`
  - Verify: each deletion succeeds

**10.2** Run `project_overview` and verify:
  - `stats.domains` is 0
  - `stats.features` is 0
  - `stats.components` is 0
  - `stats.references` is 0

**10.3** Drop the smoke test graph to leave no residue:
```bash
# The graph gnapsis_smoke_test can be dropped via psql or left for next run
# init_project with force:true will recreate it anyway
```

**10.4** Restore the original config:
```bash
mv .gnapsis.toml.bak .gnapsis.toml
```

**10.5** Reconnect the MCP server to restore the real project config: `/mcp`

**10.6** Report: "Smoke test PASSED - all 10 phases completed successfully"

## Failure Reporting

If any phase fails:
1. **Always run Phase 10.4 and 10.5 first** to restore the original config
2. Then report:
   - Phase number and subtest that failed (e.g., "Phase 4, Test 4C.1")
   - Tool name and parameters used
   - Error message received
   - "Smoke test FAILED at Phase N, Test N.X"

## Notes

- The vault source path is configured in `.gnapsis.toml` under `[[project.sources]]`
- All sources share the same graph: `gnapsis_<project_name>`
- References store `source_id` to track which source they belong to
- If vault source is not configured, skip Phase 5 and vault-related steps in Phases 6-7
- Entity IDs, reference IDs, and category IDs should be tracked throughout the test for assertions and cleanup
- Error path tests (e.g., 4C, 6B.4, 8C.1) expect specific errors - verify the error message matches
