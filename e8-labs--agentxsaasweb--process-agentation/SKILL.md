# Process Agentation Notes

Process UI feedback captured via the Agentation toolbar and make the requested changes.

## Workflow

1. **Read the notes file**
   - Read `AGENTATION_NOTES.md` from the project root
   - If the file doesn't exist or is empty, inform the user there are no annotations to process

2. **Parse and display annotations**
   - Show the user a summary of all annotations found
   - Each annotation includes: element type, selector, DOM path, position, and user notes

3. **Find the relevant code**
   - Use the selectors and DOM paths to search the codebase
   - Look for components/files that render the annotated elements
   - Common patterns to search:
     - CSS class names from selectors
     - Component names that match element types
     - Text content that appears in the annotation

4. **Process the feedback**
   - For each annotation with a note, understand what change is requested
   - If the note is unclear, ask the user for clarification
   - Make the requested changes to the code

5. **Clear the notes file**
   - After successfully processing all annotations, clear the file by calling:
     ```bash
     curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/agentation -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"action":"clear"}'
     ```
   - Or simply delete/truncate the `AGENTATION_NOTES.md` file

6. **Report changes**
   - Report back to the user what was changed
   - Do NOT use browser/chrome tools to verify unless the user explicitly requests it

## Example Annotation Format

```markdown
## Annotation: abc123
**Element:** Button
**Selector:** `.sidebar > button.primary`
**Path:** `body > div.app > aside.sidebar > button`
**Position:** x=150, y=320
**Note:** Make this button larger and use the brand primary color
```

## Tips for Finding Code

- Search for class names: `grep -r "primary" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.tsx"`
- Search for component patterns: Look for JSX that matches the element type
- Check for CSS/Tailwind classes that match the selector
- The DOM path helps identify the component hierarchy

## Limitations: Popups and Modals

When a popup or modal is open, the Agentation toolbar’s annotation field is often **disabled** (focus is trapped in the overlay, or the tool doesn’t target portaled content). The app is configured so the annotation field **can** receive focus when a modal is open (MUI `disableEnforceFocus`, Radix `trapFocus={false}`). You can add annotations inside modals by clicking the annotation field and typing.

**If a modal still traps focus — manual workaround:**

1. Close the modal/popup if needed, then add an entry to `AGENTATION_NOTES.md` in this format:

```markdown
## Annotation: manual-modal
**Element:** [describe the element, e.g. "Filter modal header"]
**Path:** [optional, e.g. "Pipeline page > Filter modal"]
**Note:** [describe the change you want, e.g. "Header height 60px, Apply button use brand primary"]
```

2. Run `/process-agentation` (or ask the assistant to process agentation). The assistant will find the modal/popup component and apply the change from the **Note** field.

The assistant can also accept the same feedback in chat (e.g. “In the pipeline filter modal, make the title 18px and the Apply button primary”) and apply it without a manual note file entry.

## Notes

- Always read the full annotation before making changes
- If multiple annotations relate to the same component, batch the changes
- Preserve existing functionality while implementing the requested changes
- The dev server must be running for annotations to sync to the file
- **NEVER use chrome-devtools or browser MCP tools unless the user explicitly requests it**
- **"Medium elevation"** (when requested for a container/popover/paper): apply border `1px solid #eaeaea`, boxShadow `0 4px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)`, borderRadius `12px`. In Pipeline1.js use `styles.mediumElevation`; elsewhere define or reuse the same values.

## User-defined modal shortcuts

When the user says **"modal cleanup"** (or "apply modal cleanup"), apply the Add Pipeline modal’s layout and styling to the modal in focus:
- Container: `w-[400px] flex flex-col gap-3 p-0 overflow-hidden`
- Style: `backgroundColor: '#ffffff'`, medium elevation with `boxShadow: '0 4px 36px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)'`, `border: '1px solid #eaeaea'`, `borderRadius: 12`

When the user says **"firecrawl modal"** (or "apply firecrawl modal"), apply the Duplicate Agent modal's full structure and styling to the modal in focus. This is the firecrawl.dev-inspired confirmation modal pattern:
- **Structure:** Header (title + optional warning icon + close button), Body (14px font), Footer (action bar with Cancel + primary button)
- **Container:** `w-[400px] max-w-[90vw] flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-[12px] bg-white`, `boxShadow: '0 4px 36px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)'`, `border: '1px solid #eaeaea'`
- **Header:** `flex flex-row items-center justify-between px-4 py-3`, `borderBottom: '1px solid #eaeaea'`; title 16px font-semibold; CloseBtn on right
- **Body:** `px-4 py-4`, `fontSize: 14`, `color: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.8)'`
- **Footer:** `flex flex-row items-center justify-between px-4 py-3`, `borderTop: '1px solid #eaeaea'` — secondary (Cancel) on far left, primary on far right
- **Cancel button:** `h-[40px] rounded-lg px-4 text-sm font-medium bg-muted text-foreground hover:bg-muted/80 transition-colors duration-150 active:scale-[0.98]`
- **Primary button:** `h-[40px] rounded-lg px-4 text-sm font-semibold bg-brand-primary text-white hover:opacity-90 transition-all duration-150 active:scale-[0.98]`
- **Backdrop:** `backgroundColor: '#00000099'`, `timeout: 250`
- **Animation:** `closeAfterTransition`, Fade 250ms, content scale 0.95→1 on enter with `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`

When the user says **"animate modal"** (or "apply animate modal"), apply the Import Leads modal’s animation and backdrop to the selected modal/element:
- **Backdrop:** `backgroundColor: '#00000099'` (60% opacity), `timeout: 250`
- **Content entry:** scale 0.95→1, opacity 0→1 over 250ms with `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` (smooth, clean, fast)
- **Content exit:** reverse the animation — scale 1→0.95, opacity 1→0 over 250ms with the same easing; use `closeAfterTransition` and call the transition's `onExited` after the exit animation so the modal unmounts cleanly. Implement via a wrapper component (e.g. scale+opacity transition) that accepts `in`, `timeout`, `onExited`, `onEnter` and wraps the modal content.

When the user says **"entry animation"** (or "apply entry animation"), apply the same entry animation as the ThreadsList filter popover (w-[230px] dropdown) to the element in focus. This includes sliding into final position, easing, and transition:
- Tailwind: `animate-in slide-in-from-bottom-2 duration-200 ease-out` (add or merge into the element's className)
- Effect: element slides in from the bottom into its final position with a 200ms ease-out transition

When the user says **"page header"** (or "apply page header"), style the selected element with the same sizing and style as the Messages page header bar:
- Container: `w-full p-4 border-b flex flex-row items-center justify-between h-[66px]`

When the user says **"filter button"** (or "apply filter button"), style the selected button to match the filter button in the page header:
- Button: `mb-1 w-auto h-10 px-3 py-3 rounded-lg bg-black/[0.02] hover:opacity-70 transition-opacity outline-none relative flex-shrink-0 flex items-center justify-center`

When the user says **"filter icon"** (or "apply filter icon"), style the icon to match the filter icon inside that button (same size and style as the 20×20 SVG in the filter button).

When the user says **"call summary update"** (or "apply call summary update"), apply the call summary card’s style, spacing, and interaction to the selected element or container. Use the same pattern as the rounded-[16px] call summary card in SystemMessage/CallTranscriptCN:
- Container: `rounded-[16px] bg-background pt-0 pb-3 px-0 flex flex-col gap-1 overflow-hidden`
- Box shadow: `0px 0px 44px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02), 0px 88px 56px -20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03), 0px 56px 56px -20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02), 0px 32px 32px -20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03), 0px 16px 24px -12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03), 0px 0px 0px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), 0px 0px 0px 10px #F9F9F9`
- Top bar: `p-3 bg-white` with `borderBottom: '1px solid #eaeaea'`
- Action row (icon buttons): gap 4px, buttons 40×40px, padding 8px, borderRadius 4px, transparent bg, hover `#ededed`, `transition-colors duration-150 ease-out`; icons black at 80% opacity; row scaled to 95% (`transform: scale(0.95)`, `origin-left`)

When the user says **"secondary button"** (or "apply secondary button"), style the selected button to match the AI Action button in the call summary card and add the same interaction:
- Button: `flex items-center gap-1 h-[40px] rounded-lg bg-muted px-3 text-sm font-medium text-foreground hover:bg-muted/80 transition-colors duration-150 active:scale-[0.98] [&_img]:hover:animate-pulse [&_svg]:text-black`
- Press animation: scale from 1 to 0.98 on active/press (`active:scale-[0.98]` with `transition-colors duration-150` or `transition-transform duration-150`)

When the user says **"icon button"** (or "apply icon button"), style the selected button to match the Read Transcript / Copy Call ID icon buttons in the call summary card:
- Button: `rounded flex items-center justify-center w-10 h-10 bg-transparent hover:bg-black/5 transition-colors duration-150 ease-out`
- Size: 40×40px, padding 8px, borderRadius 8px
- Icon inside: black at 80% opacity (`[&_svg]:opacity-80` or `style={{ opacity: 0.8 }}` on the icon)

When the user says **"compose email"** (or "apply compose email"), apply the styling and interaction of the Messages compose form (MessageComposer) to the selected element and its relevant children. Do not change any functionality—only UI (classes, inline styles, layout). Match:
- Container: `w-full px-3 py-3 flex flex-col gap-1`
- Tab/header row: `flex items-center justify-between border-b m-0 gap-1 py-1`; tab buttons with `gap-2 pb-1 h-8`
- Text inputs: `h-[42px] border-[0.5px] border-gray-200 rounded-lg focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-brand-primary focus-visible:border-brand-primary`
- Body/editor wrapper: `border border-brand-primary/20 rounded-lg bg-white`
- Buttons: use same rounded-lg, height, and focus/active patterns as in the composer (e.g. Send button)

When the user says **"conic glow"** (or "apply conic glow"), apply the animated conic-gradient glow border (same as the Web Agent chat input) to the selected/focused element. Implementation:
- **Name:** Conic glow (animated purple/magenta border on hover and focus).
- **Structure:** Wrap the target element in a container with `className="relative group w-full"` (adjust width/display if the layout requires it). Inside that container, add six glow layer divs in order: `<div className="chat-input-glow-layer-1" aria-hidden />`, then `chat-input-glow-layer-2` through `chat-input-glow-layer-6`. Then wrap the original element in `<div className="relative z-10">…</div>` so it sits above the glow.
- **CSS:** The classes `.chat-input-glow-layer-1` through `.chat-input-glow-layer-6` are defined in `app/globals.css`; they use `border-radius: 24px` and colors from the brand palette (primary, complementary, triadic, tetradic). For a different radius, add a modifier class in globals that overrides the border-radius (e.g. `.conic-glow-sm` with `border-radius: 12px`) and use it on the layer divs.
- **Usage:** Works on any element (input, card, button, div). The glow is hidden by default and animates only on focus-within.
