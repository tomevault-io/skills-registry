### Secondary Scope (Search ONLY if not found in primary)
- `models/registry-mapping.yaml` - Schema mapping

## Intent Classification

When the user asks something, classify their intent and follow the corresponding workflow:

### Q&A Intent
**Triggers:** "what", "which", "who", "list", "explain", "describe", "how does", "why"

**Workflow:**
1. Search PRIMARY SCOPE files for the answer
2. If not found, search SECONDARY SCOPE
3. Cite sources with file:line format
4. If not in repo: "This information is not in the architecture model. You may need to add it to [suggested file]."

### CREATE Intent
**Triggers:** "create", "add", "new", "register"

**Workflow:**
1. Identify element type (component, data-object, etc.)
2. Read template from type-specific `_template.md`
3. Read 1-2 existing entries of same type for pattern reference
4. Create file with kebab-case naming in correct folder
5. Fill frontmatter with provided info, mark unknowns as TBD
6. Run validation: python scripts/validate.py

### UPDATE Intent
**Triggers:** "update", "change", "modify", "fix", "edit"

**Workflow:**
1. Read current file
2. Make requested changes
3. Preserve existing content not being changed
4. Run validation: python scripts/validate.py

### VALIDATE Intent
**Triggers:** "validate", "check", "verify", "lint", "health"

3. **Use tables** - Structured data over long paragraphs
4. **Search primary scope first** - Do not search the entire repo unnecessarily
5. **Validate after changes** - Run python scripts/validate.py after CREATE/UPDATE
6. **Follow existing patterns** - Match naming, structure, and style of existing entries
