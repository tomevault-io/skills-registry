# Frontend Design

A skill for building distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with
genuine aesthetic direction. Every output is intentional, cohesive, and
visually memorable — not generic.

Compatible with: Claude, Claude Code, VS Code agent extensions, Cursor,
Windsurf, Antigravity, and any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard.

## Process

Follow this sequence on every frontend request.

### Step 1 — Understand the Context

Before writing a single line of code, answer these internally:

- **Purpose** — What problem does this interface solve? What action should a user take?
- **Audience** — Who is the user? Their expectations shape the aesthetic.
- **Tone** — What feeling should this produce? (See Aesthetic Directions below.)
- **Constraints** — Framework, accessibility requirements, performance targets, existing design system?
- **Memorability** — What is the one thing a user will remember about this interface?

### Step 2 — Commit to an Aesthetic Direction

Pick one direction and execute it with precision. Half-committed design is always worse than a bold wrong choice. Some directions to consider:

| Direction | Character |
|---|---|
| Brutally minimal | Maximum whitespace, one font weight, monochrome, zero decoration |
| Editorial / magazine | Strong typographic hierarchy, columns, pull quotes, grid-breaking |
| Retro-futuristic | Scanlines, glows, monospace, terminal-inspired, neon on dark |
| Organic / natural | Soft curves, earthy palette, texture, handwritten or slab type |
| Luxury / refined | Tight tracking, serif display, muted gold or black, deliberate restraint |
| Brutalist / raw | Visible structure, clashing scale, intentional ugliness as design |
| Playful / toy-like | Thick borders, saturated colour, bouncy motion, rounded geometry |
| Art deco / geometric | Symmetry, ornament, repeated motifs, high contrast |
| Industrial / utilitarian | Functional layout, data-dense, monospace, subdued palette |
| Maximalist | Layered type, competing textures, controlled chaos, every pixel used |

Do not default to any of these — use them as departure points. The final direction must feel designed specifically for this context.

### Step 3 — Design Decisions Before Code

Define these before opening a code block:

- **Font pairing** — One distinctive display font, one refined body font. Never Inter, Roboto, Arial, or system fonts.
- **Colour palette** — Two to four colours maximum. One dominant, one sharp accent. Define as CSS custom properties.
- **Layout structure** — Grid, asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, or controlled density. Avoid default stacked-card layouts.
- **Motion** — Identify one high-impact animation moment (page load reveal, hover state, scroll trigger). One well-executed animation beats ten scattered micro-interactions.
- **Atmosphere** — Background treatment: gradient mesh, noise texture, geometric pattern, layered transparency, grain overlay, or dramatic shadow. Never a flat solid colour unless the concept demands it.

### Step 4 — Write Production-Grade Code

Implement the design with the following standards.

**Code quality**
- Functional and complete — no placeholder comments, no TODO, no stub logic
- Responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Accessible — semantic HTML, keyboard navigable, sufficient colour contrast
- Performant — no unnecessary repaints, efficient selectors, lazy loading where appropriate

**CSS**
- Use CSS custom properties for all colours, spacing, and type scales
- Animate only `transform` and `opacity` (compositor-friendly)
- Never `transition: all` — list properties explicitly
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for all animations
- Use `focus-visible` for keyboard focus styles — never remove outline without a replacement

**Typography**
- Load fonts from Google Fonts, Bunny Fonts, or equivalent (prefer variable fonts)
- Set a clear type scale — at minimum: display, heading, body, caption
- Apply `text-wrap: balance` on headings
- Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for any numbers or data

**Motion**
- CSS-only for HTML/CSS output
- Use `animation-delay` for staggered reveals on page load
- Hover and focus states must have visible, intentional transitions
- Scroll-triggered effects where they add genuine value

**Framework-specific**
- React: use hooks correctly; prefer CSS modules or Tailwind if available; no inline styles for layout
- Vue / Svelte: scoped styles; reactive data for any interactive state
- Plain HTML: single file output unless otherwise requested; embed all CSS in a `<style>` block

## Aesthetic Rules

### Always

- Commit fully to one design direction — no hedging
- Make every spacing decision intentional — generous negative space or controlled density, never accidental middle ground
- Create atmosphere in backgrounds — depth, texture, or gradient over flat colour
- Vary between light and dark themes across outputs — never default to one
- Let the font choice carry personality — it is the loudest design decision

### Never

- Generic font families: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui, or plain sans-serif as a primary font
- Purple gradients on white backgrounds — the most overused AI-generated aesthetic
- Default card-grid layouts with drop shadows and rounded corners applied without thought
- Evenly distributed colour palettes with no dominant colour
- Space Grotesk, DM Sans, Plus Jakarta Sans, or any other overused startup font
- Scattered micro-interactions with no focal animation moment
- Flat solid colour backgrounds where there is space for more
- Cookie-cutter designs that could belong to any project

---

## Output Format

Produce complete, working code. Structure the response as follows:

1. One sentence stating the aesthetic direction chosen and why it fits the context — no heading, no bullet list.
2. Complete code block — the full implementation, ready to run or paste.
3. Font and dependency note — list any external fonts or libraries used and how to load them, if not already included in the code.

Do not include lengthy design breakdowns, feature lists, or bullet-point summaries of what was built. The code speaks for itself.

## Examples

### Example 1: Landing page

User: "Build a landing page for an embedded systems consultancy"
Agent: Chooses an industrial/utilitarian direction — dark background, monospace font, tight grid, amber accent, terminal-inspired hero animation. Outputs a single complete HTML file.

### Example 2: Dashboard

User: "Create a data dashboard for IoT sensor readings"
Agent: Chooses a refined minimal direction — high data density, tabular numerics, muted palette with a single red alert colour, clean geometric sans-serif, subtle grid lines. Outputs a React component.

### Example 3: Redesign request

User: "Make my signup form look better"
Agent: Asks for the existing code or a description of the current design, then applies a clear aesthetic direction — does not simply add padding and border-radius.

### Example 4: Component

User: "Build a pricing card component"
Agent: Chooses a direction (e.g. luxury/refined), pairs a serif display font with a geometric body font, uses a two-colour palette, adds a single hover lift animation, outputs a complete standalone component.

## Notes

- Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic. Maximalist designs require elaborate code. Minimalist designs require restraint and precision — not less effort, different effort.
- If the user specifies a framework, use it. If not, default to plain HTML/CSS/JS for maximum compatibility.
- If the user provides brand colours, fonts, or an existing design system, work within those constraints while still making intentional choices within them.
- This skill produces working code — not wireframes, not mockups, not design descriptions.
