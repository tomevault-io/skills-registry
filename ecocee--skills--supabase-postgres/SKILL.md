# Supabase Postgres Best Practices

A comprehensive, opinionated guide to writing secure, performant, and
maintainable Postgres code in Supabase projects. Designed for vibe coding
workflows — fast iteration without sacrificing correctness or safety.

Compatible with: Claude, Claude Code, VS Code agent extensions, Cursor,
Windsurf, Antigravity, and any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard.

---

## Philosophy

Speed of iteration and production safety are not opposites. These rules exist
to let you move fast without breaking things silently. Every rule here has
caused a real outage, a real data leak, or a real performance cliff somewhere.
Follow them by default. Deviate deliberately and with documentation.

---

## When to Apply These Rules

Apply this skill when:

- Writing new SQL queries or stored functions
- Designing or migrating a schema
- Adding or reviewing indexes
- Setting up or auditing Row-Level Security policies
- Configuring connection pooling (PgBouncer / Supavisor)
- Debugging slow queries or high database load
- Reviewing any database-related code in a PR
- Generating Supabase migrations or edge function database calls

---

## Rule Categories

Rules are ordered by impact. Address higher-priority categories before lower ones.

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Query Performance | Critical | `query-` |
| 2 | Connection Management | Critical | `conn-` |
| 3 | Security and RLS | Critical | `security-` |
| 4 | Schema Design | High | `schema-` |
| 5 | Concurrency and Locking | Medium-High | `lock-` |
| 6 | Data Access Patterns | Medium | `data-` |
| 7 | Monitoring and Diagnostics | Low-Medium | `monitor-` |
| 8 | Advanced Features | Low | `advanced-` |

---

## Category 1 — Query Performance (Critical)

Slow queries are the most common cause of Supabase project degradation.
Fix these before anything else.

### Missing Indexes

Every column used in WHERE, JOIN ON, ORDER BY, or GROUP BY needs an index
unless the table has fewer than a few hundred rows.

```sql
-- Bad: full table scan on every request
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = $1;

-- Good: index on the lookup column
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders (user_id);
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = $1;
```

Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on any query that feels slow. Look for Seq Scan on large tables.

### SELECT * in Application Queries

Never use SELECT * in application code. Fetch only the columns you need.
This reduces network payload, avoids accidentally exposing sensitive columns,
and allows index-only scans.

```sql
-- Bad
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = $1;

-- Good
SELECT id, username, avatar_url FROM profiles WHERE id = $1;
```

### N+1 Queries

Never execute a query inside a loop. Batch fetches with WHERE id = ANY($1) or
use a JOIN.

```sql
-- Bad: one query per user
FOR user_id IN user_ids LOOP
  SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = user_id;
END LOOP;

-- Good: single batched query
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = ANY($1);
```

### Non-SARGable Predicates

Avoid wrapping indexed columns in functions — it prevents index use.

```sql
-- Bad: function on indexed column defeats index
SELECT * FROM events WHERE DATE(created_at) = '2024-01-01';

-- Good: range predicate uses index
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01'
  AND created_at < '2024-01-02';
```

### Pagination with OFFSET

OFFSET scans and discards rows. Use keyset pagination for large tables.

```sql
-- Bad: slow and gets worse as page number increases
SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20 OFFSET 10000;

-- Good: keyset pagination — O(log n) regardless of page depth
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE created_at < $last_seen_created_at
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

---

## Category 2 — Connection Management (Critical)

Postgres has a hard connection limit. Exhausting it brings your entire project down.

### Always Use a Connection Pooler

Never connect directly to Postgres from serverless functions, edge functions,
or any horizontally scaled service. Use Supavisor (Supabase's pooler) or PgBouncer.

- Direct connections: for long-lived server processes only
- Transaction mode pooling: for serverless and edge functions
- Session mode pooling: for queries that require session state

### Connection String Selection

```
-- Serverless / edge functions: use the pooler port via Supavisor
postgresql://user:pass@db.project.supabase.co:5432/postgres

-- Long-lived servers: direct connection
postgresql://user:pass@db.project.supabase.co:5432/postgres?pgbouncer=false
```

### Avoid Long-Running Transactions

Long transactions hold locks, bloat the WAL, and prevent autovacuum from
cleaning up dead rows. Set a statement timeout in application code.

```sql
-- Set at the session level for risky operations
SET statement_timeout = '30s';

-- Or per transaction
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL statement_timeout = '10s';
-- your queries
COMMIT;
```

---

## Category 3 — Security and RLS (Critical)

A misconfigured RLS policy is a data breach. Treat every RLS rule as a
security boundary, not a convenience filter.

### Enable RLS on Every User-Facing Table

```sql
-- Enable RLS immediately after creating any table
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Without this, any authenticated user can read all rows through the Supabase client.

### Write Policies That Fail Closed

```sql
-- Explicit policy: users can only read their own profile
CREATE POLICY "users can only read own profile"
ON profiles FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- With RLS enabled and no matching policy, Postgres denies by default
-- Always verify this with a test using a different user's JWT
```

### Avoid Volatile Functions in RLS Policies

RLS policies are evaluated per row. A subquery or volatile function in a
policy runs on every row — this is a severe performance problem.

```sql
-- Bad: subquery executes per row
CREATE POLICY "org members only"
ON documents FOR SELECT
USING (
  org_id IN (SELECT org_id FROM memberships WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
);

-- Good: security definer function with cached result
CREATE POLICY "org members only"
ON documents FOR SELECT
USING (is_org_member(org_id, auth.uid()));
```

### Service Role Key Bypasses RLS

The service role key bypasses all RLS policies. Never expose it to the client,
never include it in frontend code, and never commit it to a public repository.

```
# .env.local — Next.js example
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...       # server-side only, never NEXT_PUBLIC_
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...   # safe for the browser
```

### auth.uid() Is Only Meaningful in RLS Context

Do not use auth.uid() in service role queries — it returns null outside a
user JWT context and policies will silently pass or fail unexpectedly.

---

## Category 4 — Schema Design (High)

Schema decisions are expensive to reverse after data exists.
Get these right before writing application code.

### Use UUIDs as Primary Keys

Sequential integer IDs are predictable and enumerable by attackers.

```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Always Include created_at and updated_at

```sql
-- Auto-update updated_at with a trigger
CREATE TRIGGER set_updated_at
BEFORE UPDATE ON documents
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION moddatetime(updated_at);
```

### Use timestamptz, Not timestamp

timestamp stores no timezone. timestamptz stores UTC and converts on display.
Always use timestamptz — timestamp causes silent timezone bugs in production.

### Partial Indexes for Sparse Conditions

Index only the rows you actually query.

```sql
-- Bad: indexes all rows including inactive ones you never query
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);

-- Good: indexes only rows matching the common query condition
CREATE INDEX idx_active_users_email ON users (email)
WHERE is_active = true;
```

### Composite Indexes for Multi-Column Queries

Column order matters. Put the most selective or equality-tested column first.

```sql
-- Query: WHERE user_id = $1 AND status = 'pending'
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_status ON orders (user_id, status);
```

---

## Category 5 — Concurrency and Locking (Medium-High)

### Set lock_timeout on Schema Migrations

ALTER TABLE acquires AccessExclusiveLock. On a busy table, this queues behind
active queries and blocks everything that follows it.

```sql
SET lock_timeout = '2s';
ALTER TABLE large_table ADD COLUMN new_col text;
```

For large production tables, use pg_repack or phased migrations.

### Prefer Optimistic Concurrency Over SELECT FOR UPDATE

SELECT FOR UPDATE locks rows for the full transaction. Use a version column
for most application-level concurrency control instead.

```sql
-- Optimistic: check version on update
UPDATE documents
SET body = $1, version = version + 1
WHERE id = $2 AND version = $3;
-- 0 rows updated = conflict — retry or surface to user
```

---

## Category 6 — Data Access Patterns (Medium)

### Always Use Parameterised Queries

Never concatenate user input into SQL. Parameterised queries prevent SQL
injection and allow Postgres to cache the query plan.

```sql
-- Bad: SQL injection + no plan caching
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '" + email + "'"

-- Good
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1;
```

### Batch Writes

```sql
-- Bad: one round trip per row
INSERT INTO events (type, data) VALUES ('click', $1);
INSERT INTO events (type, data) VALUES ('click', $2);

-- Good: single round trip
INSERT INTO events (type, data) VALUES
  ('click', $1),
  ('click', $2),
  ('click', $3);
```

### Use RETURNING to Avoid Extra Queries

```sql
-- Bad: insert then fetch
INSERT INTO posts (title, body) VALUES ($1, $2);
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = lastval();

-- Good: single query
INSERT INTO posts (title, body) VALUES ($1, $2)
RETURNING id, created_at;
```

---

## Category 7 — Monitoring and Diagnostics (Low-Medium)

### Query Slowest Queries with pg_stat_statements

Supabase enables pg_stat_statements by default.

```sql
SELECT query, calls, mean_exec_time, total_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Use EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS), Not Just EXPLAIN

EXPLAIN shows the plan. EXPLAIN ANALYZE runs the query and shows real timings.

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT TEXT)
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = $1 AND status = 'pending';
```

### Monitor Table Bloat

```sql
SELECT relname, n_dead_tup, n_live_tup,
       round(n_dead_tup::numeric / nullif(n_live_tup + n_dead_tup, 0) * 100, 2) AS dead_pct
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

Dead rows accumulate when autovacuum cannot keep up. Tune autovacuum or
run VACUUM ANALYZE manually on write-heavy tables.

---

## Category 8 — Advanced Features (Low)

### Generated Columns for Full-Text Search

```sql
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector
GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
  to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || coalesce(description, ''))
) STORED;

CREATE INDEX idx_products_search ON products USING GIN (search_vector);
```

### Materialised Views for Expensive Aggregations

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_revenue AS
SELECT
  date_trunc('month', created_at) AS month,
  sum(amount) AS total
FROM payments
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY 1;

REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY monthly_revenue;
```

### Scheduled Jobs with pg_cron

```sql
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'refresh-monthly-revenue',
  '0 1 * * *',
  'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY monthly_revenue'
);
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (Always Flag)

| Anti-Pattern | Risk |
|---|---|
| SELECT * in application code | Data leakage, over-fetching, no index-only scans |
| No RLS on user-facing tables | Any authenticated user can read all rows |
| Service role key in frontend code | Full database access exposed publicly |
| Queries inside loops (N+1) | Latency grows linearly with data size |
| OFFSET on large tables | Full scan, performance degrades with page depth |
| Functions on indexed columns in WHERE | Index bypassed, full table scan |
| timestamp instead of timestamptz | Silent timezone bugs in production |
| Long transactions in request handlers | Lock contention, WAL bloat |
| String concatenation in SQL | SQL injection vulnerability |
| ALTER TABLE without lock_timeout | Blocks all queries on a busy table |
| No RETURNING on INSERT/UPDATE | Unnecessary extra database round trip |
| Volatile function in RLS policy | Per-row execution, severe performance hit |
| Missing updated_at trigger | Stale data, broken cache invalidation |

---

## Output Format

When reviewing SQL or schema code, group findings by file or query block:

```
## table_name or file.sql

file:line  [CRITICAL]  No RLS policy — all authenticated users can read this table
file:line  [CRITICAL]  Service role key referenced in client-side code
file:line  [HIGH]      Missing index on orders.user_id — full scan on JOIN
file:line  [MEDIUM]    SELECT * — specify required columns
file:line  [LOW]       timestamp → use timestamptz

## other_query_or_file

pass
```

Severity: CRITICAL (security or outage risk), HIGH (significant performance
degradation), MEDIUM (best practice violation), LOW (minor optimization).

---

## Quick Reference — Supabase-Specific

| Task | Correct Approach |
|---|---|
| Serverless DB connection | Supavisor pooler URL, transaction mode |
| Auth in RLS policy | `auth.uid()`, `auth.role()`, `auth.jwt()` |
| Safe server-side operations | Service role key, server-side only |
| Scheduled jobs | `pg_cron` via Supabase dashboard or SQL |
| Full-text search | `tsvector` generated column + GIN index |
| Soft deletes | `deleted_at timestamptz` + partial index on `deleted_at IS NULL` |
| Realtime subscriptions | Enable replication on the table in Supabase dashboard |
