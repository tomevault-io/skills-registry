# Documentation Automation Skill

This skill proactively maintains project documentation as you work, ensuring that changes are properly documented across CHANGELOG.md, README files, and inline code comments.

## When This Skill Is Used

**Automatically trigger this skill** (proactively offer to use it) after:
- ✅ Implementing a new feature
- ✅ Fixing a bug
- ✅ Making breaking changes
- ✅ Adding new API endpoints or functions
- ✅ Refactoring significant code
- ✅ Completing a user story or task
- ✅ Before creating a git commit for significant work

**Do NOT trigger for**:
- Minor typo fixes (unless in documentation itself)
- Work in progress (not yet complete)
- Trivial code cleanup with no functional impact

## Documentation Strategy

### 1. CHANGELOG.md (Primary)

**Location**: Root `/Users/cam/Developer/muni/CHANGELOG.md`

**Format**: Conventional Commits with semantic versioning

**Entry Structure**:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New feature description with reference to files changed (e.g., bvr/firmware/crates/control/src/lib.rs:150-180)
- Another feature with link to relevant documentation

### Changed
- Modified behavior with migration notes if breaking
- Updated API with before/after examples

### Fixed
- Bug fix description with issue reference if applicable (#123)

### Deprecated
- Feature scheduled for removal with timeline

### Removed
- Removed feature with migration path

### Security
- Security fix (never include vulnerability details)
```

**Conventional Commit Prefixes**:
- `feat`: New feature (user-facing)
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `refactor`: Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Add/update tests
- `chore`: Tooling, dependencies, build config
- `style`: Code style (formatting, no logic change)
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system changes

**Key Points**:
- [ ] Entries go under `## [Unreleased]` until versioned
- [ ] Use present tense ("Add feature", not "Added feature")
- [ ] Include file paths for easy navigation
- [ ] Group related changes together
- [ ] Reference issue numbers with `#123`
- [ ] Breaking changes get `### Changed` with migration notes

**Example Entry**:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Safety watchdog with 500ms timeout in `bvr/firmware/crates/control/src/lib.rs` to automatically transition to Idle mode when commands stop arriving
- E-stop state machine transitions in `bvr/firmware/crates/state/src/lib.rs` requiring explicit release before resuming operation
- LED feedback for rover modes: green pulse (teleop), cyan pulse (autonomous), red flash (e-stop)

### Fixed
- CAN bus frame parsing now includes bounds checking in `bvr/firmware/crates/can/src/vesc.rs:167-191` to prevent panics on malformed frames (#42)
```

**See**: [changelog-format.md](changelog-format.md) for complete formatting guide.

### 2. README Files (Feature-Specific)

**Strategy**: Update appropriate README based on scope of change.

**README Hierarchy**:
```
/README.md                          # Project overview, quick start
/bvr/README.md                      # BVR rover-specific
/bvr/firmware/README.md             # Firmware development guide
/bvr/cad/README.md                  # CAD system usage
/depot/README.md                    # Depot services overview
/depot/console/README.md            # Console frontend development
/mcu/README.md                      # MCU firmware guide
```

**What to Update**:
- **Features List**: Add new capabilities to feature lists
- **Getting Started**: Update installation/setup steps if changed
- **API Documentation**: Document new endpoints, functions, or interfaces
- **Configuration**: Add new config options with examples
- **Examples**: Add usage examples for new features
- **Troubleshooting**: Add known issues and solutions

**README Update Rules**:
- [ ] Keep consistent tone and formatting with existing README
- [ ] Add to existing sections (don't create duplicates)
- [ ] Include code examples for complex features
- [ ] Link to detailed documentation files if lengthy
- [ ] Update table of contents if present

**Example README Addition**:
```markdown
### Safety Features

#### Watchdog Timer
The control system includes a command watchdog that monitors teleop connection health. If no commands are received for 500ms, the rover automatically transitions to Idle mode and stops all motors.

Configuration in `bvr/firmware/config/bvr.toml`:
```toml
[control]
command_timeout_ms = 500
```

See `bvr/firmware/crates/control/src/lib.rs` for implementation details.
```

### 3. Inline Documentation

**Rust Documentation Comments**:

**Module-level** (`//!` at top of `lib.rs`):
```rust
//! State machine and mode management for bvr.
//!
//! This module implements the rover's operational modes (Disabled, Idle, Teleop,
//! Autonomous, EStop, Fault) with safety-critical transition logic. The state
//! machine ensures that e-stop requires explicit release and that invalid
//! transitions are rejected.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! let mut sm = StateMachine::new();
//! sm.handle(Event::Enable);
//! assert_eq!(sm.mode(), Mode::Idle);
//! ```
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! E-stop transitions are one-way and require explicit `EStopRelease` event.
//! Always check `is_driving()` before sending motor commands.
```

**Function-level** (`///`):
```rust
/// Handles a state machine event and transitions to a new mode if valid.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `event` - The event to process (Enable, Disable, EStop, etc.)
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let mut sm = StateMachine::new();
/// sm.handle(Event::Enable);
/// assert_eq!(sm.mode(), Mode::Idle);
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// E-stop events are accepted from any mode but require explicit release.
pub fn handle(&mut self, event: Event) {
    // ...
}
```

**Struct/Enum-level**:
```rust
/// Represents the rover's current operational mode.
///
/// The mode determines which operations are permitted. Use `is_driving()`
/// to check if motor commands should be sent, and `is_safe()` to check
/// if configuration changes are allowed.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum Mode {
    /// Motors disabled, awaiting initialization
    Disabled,
    /// Ready state, motors enabled but stationary
    Idle,
    /// Under human control via teleop
    Teleop,
    /// Autonomous navigation active
    Autonomous,
    /// Emergency stop, requires explicit release
    EStop,
    /// Error state, requires fault clear
    Fault,
}
```

**TypeScript/React Documentation** (JSDoc):

**Function/Component**:
```typescript
/**
 * Manages WebSocket connection to rover for real-time teleoperation.
 *
 * Handles binary protocol encoding/decoding, automatic reconnection with
 * exponential backoff, and connection state management.
 *
 * @param address - WebSocket address (e.g., "ws://rover:4850")
 * @returns Connection state and send function
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const { connected, send } = useRoverConnection();
 * if (connected) {
 *   send(encodeTwist({ linear: 1.0, angular: 0.0, boost: false }));
 * }
 * ```
 */
export function useRoverConnection(address: string) {
  // ...
}
```

**Interface**:
```typescript
/**
 * Telemetry data received from rover at 20 Hz.
 *
 * Contains current operational mode, pose, velocity, power status,
 * and temperature readings for all motors and controllers.
 */
export interface Telemetry {
  /** Current operational mode (Idle, Teleop, etc.) */
  mode: Mode;
  /** Position and heading in world frame */
  pose: Pose;
  /** Current velocity command */
  velocity: Twist;
  /** Battery voltage and current */
  power: PowerStatus;
  /** Motor and controller temperatures (°C) */
  temperatures: TempStatus;
}
```

**When to Add Inline Documentation**:
- [ ] All public functions/methods (Rust `pub fn`, TypeScript `export`)
- [ ] All public structs/enums/interfaces
- [ ] All public modules (Rust `lib.rs`)
- [ ] Complex algorithms requiring explanation
- [ ] Safety-critical functions (always document safety invariants)
- [ ] Functions with non-obvious behavior

**When NOT to Add**:
- Private implementation details (unless complex)
- Self-explanatory getters/setters
- Trivial functions (<5 lines, obvious purpose)

### 4. Cross-References and Links

**Update cross-references** when:
- Moving functions between files
- Renaming modules or functions
- Adding new related documentation
- Splitting files

**Files with Cross-References**:
- `/Users/cam/Developer/muni/CLAUDE.md` - Project overview (central reference)
- `README.md` files - Link to detailed docs
- Skill supporting docs - Reference CLAUDE.md and other skills

**Cross-Reference Patterns**:
```markdown
<!-- Markdown links -->
See [firmware architecture](bvr/firmware/README.md) for details.
Refer to [safety checklist](.claude/skills/firmware-review/safety-checklist.md).

<!-- File path references -->
Implementation: `bvr/firmware/crates/state/src/lib.rs:50-120`

<!-- Code references with line numbers -->
The watchdog is implemented in bvr/firmware/crates/control/src/lib.rs:162-193
```

### 5. Detection Logic

**Automatically detect what needs documentation**:

**Check for new public APIs**:
```bash
# Rust: Find pub fn without ///
grep -rn "pub fn" --include="*.rs" | grep -v "///"

# Rust: Find pub struct without ///
grep -rn "pub struct" --include="*.rs" | grep -v "///"

# TypeScript: Find export function without /**
grep -rn "export function" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "/\*\*"
```

**Check for missing CHANGELOG entries**:
```bash
# Recent commits not in CHANGELOG
git log --since="1 week ago" --pretty=format:"%s" | grep -v "docs:" | grep -v "chore:"
```

**Check for outdated documentation**:
- Files modified recently but README not updated (check git timestamps)
- New features implemented but no example code
- Breaking changes without migration notes

## Documentation Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Changes

After completing work, identify:
1. **What changed**: Files modified, functions added/changed
2. **User impact**: Is this user-facing? Breaking change?
3. **Scope**: Which subsystem (firmware, console, MCU, CAD)?

Use git diff to see changes:
```bash
git diff --name-only
git diff --stat
```

### Step 2: Update CHANGELOG.md

Add entry under `## [Unreleased]`:
1. Determine category (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
2. Write clear, present-tense description
3. Include file paths for navigation
4. Reference issues if applicable
5. Add breaking change notes if needed

### Step 3: Update Relevant README

Based on scope, update appropriate README:
- Root README: High-level project features
- Subsystem README: Implementation details
- Component README: Usage examples

### Step 4: Add/Update Inline Documentation

For new or significantly changed code:
1. Add module-level docs (`//!` or top-level comment)
2. Document all public APIs
3. Include examples for complex functions
4. Document safety invariants

### Step 5: Update Cross-References

If files moved or restructured:
1. Update links in CLAUDE.md
2. Update relative paths in READMEs
3. Fix broken skill references

### Step 6: Verify

- [ ] CHANGELOG entry is clear and complete
- [ ] README accurately reflects new features
- [ ] All public APIs are documented
- [ ] Examples compile/work
- [ ] Cross-references resolve
- [ ] Formatting is consistent

## Special Cases

### Breaking Changes

**CHANGELOG**:
```markdown
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `set_mode()` to `handle_event()` in `state` crate for clarity

  Migration:
  ```rust
  // Before
  sm.set_mode(Mode::Teleop);

  // After
  sm.handle(Event::Enable);
  ```
```

**README**:
Add migration guide section if significant.

### Security Fixes

**CHANGELOG** (never include vulnerability details):
```markdown
### Security
- Fixed input validation issue in teleop command handler
```

**No public details** until after coordinated disclosure.

### Deprecations

**CHANGELOG**:
```markdown
### Deprecated
- `old_function()` is deprecated and will be removed in v2.0. Use `new_function()` instead.
```

**Inline Documentation**:
```rust
/// Legacy function for backward compatibility.
///
/// # Deprecated
/// This function is deprecated since v1.5 and will be removed in v2.0.
/// Use [`new_function`] instead.
#[deprecated(since = "1.5.0", note = "use `new_function` instead")]
pub fn old_function() {
    // ...
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: New Feature (Safety Watchdog)

**CHANGELOG Addition**:
```markdown
### Added
- Safety watchdog in `bvr/firmware/crates/control/src/lib.rs` monitors command reception and automatically transitions to Idle mode after 500ms timeout, preventing runaway rovers if connection is lost
```

**README Update** (`bvr/firmware/README.md`):
```markdown
## Safety Features

### Command Watchdog

The control loop includes a command watchdog that monitors teleop connection health:
- Timeout: 500ms (configurable)
- Action: Automatic transition to Idle mode
- Reset: Fed on every valid command reception

**Configuration**:
```toml
[control]
command_timeout_ms = 500
```

**Implementation**: `crates/control/src/lib.rs:162-193`
```

**Inline Documentation**:
```rust
/// Command watchdog for safety monitoring.
///
/// Tracks the time since the last valid command was received. If the timeout
/// duration elapses without receiving commands, `is_timed_out()` returns true,
/// indicating that the rover should transition to a safe state.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let mut watchdog = Watchdog::new(Duration::from_millis(500));
/// assert!(watchdog.is_timed_out());  // Initially timed out
///
/// watchdog.feed();  // Reset timer
/// assert!(!watchdog.is_timed_out());
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The watchdog timeout should be tuned to balance responsiveness with network
/// jitter. Too short causes false positives; too long delays safety response.
pub struct Watchdog {
    timeout: Duration,
    last_command: Option<Instant>,
}
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix (CAN Frame Parsing)

**CHANGELOG Addition**:
```markdown
### Fixed
- CAN bus VESC status frame parsing now validates buffer length before accessing bytes in `bvr/firmware/crates/can/src/vesc.rs:167-191`, preventing panics on malformed frames (#42)
```

**No README change** (implementation detail, not user-facing).

**Inline Documentation** (if not already present):
```rust
/// Parses VESC STATUS1 frame containing ERPM, current, and duty cycle.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `data` - CAN frame payload (must be exactly 8 bytes)
///
/// # Returns
///
/// `Ok(())` if parsing succeeds, `Err(CanError::InvalidFrame)` if data is
/// too short or malformed.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This function performs bounds checking before indexing into `data` to
/// prevent panics on malformed frames.
fn parse_status1(&mut self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<(), CanError> {
    if data.len() < 8 {
        warn!("STATUS1 frame too short: {} bytes", data.len());
        return Err(CanError::InvalidFrame);
    }
    // ... safe indexing
}
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Good CHANGELOG Entries

✅ **Good**:
- "Add rate limiting to prevent sudden acceleration in `control` crate with configurable max accel/decel values"
- "Fix WebSocket reconnection logic to use exponential backoff up to 30s max delay"
- "Update VESC CAN protocol to use big-endian byte order per spec"

❌ **Bad**:
- "Fix bug" (what bug?)
- "Update code" (what changed?)
- "Improve performance" (how? where? by how much?)

### Writing Good Inline Documentation

✅ **Good**:
- Includes purpose, parameters, return values, examples, safety notes
- Clear, concise language
- Links to related functions/types
- Documents edge cases and error conditions

❌ **Bad**:
- Repeats function name ("This function does X" for `fn do_x()`)
- No examples for complex APIs
- Missing safety documentation for unsafe code
- Outdated information after refactoring

### Maintaining README Consistency

- Match existing heading structure
- Use same formatting (code blocks, lists, etc.)
- Follow project tone (technical vs. beginner-friendly)
- Update table of contents if adding sections
- Place new sections logically (not just at end)
