# Answer Generation

## Instructions

Generate answers using functions in `components/generator.py`. Synthesizes information from graded-relevant documents or provides fallback when no context available.

**Default workflow:**

```python
# Use original query (not rewritten) for generation
result = generate_answer_with_metadata(original_query, relevant_documents)
answer = result['answer']
```

**Key functions:**

```python
# Standard generation with metadata (preferred)
result = generate_answer_with_metadata(query, documents, include_sources=True)
# Returns: answer, num_documents_used, has_context, sources, collections_used

# Basic generation
result = generate_answer(query, documents)
# Returns: answer, num_documents_used, has_context, model_used
```

**Generation modes:**

1. **With context** (documents provided): Synthesizes from multiple documents with source attribution
2. **Without context** (no documents or empty list): Acknowledges lack of information, provides helpful fallback

**Critical:** Always use `original_query` for generation, NOT `current_query` (which may be rewritten). This ensures the answer addresses what the user actually asked.

**Implementation:** `components/generator.py`, uses `GENERATION_MODEL` from `config.py` (default: Haiku 4.5), temperature 0.3, max tokens 2000.

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard generation with context

```python
# Input
result = generate_answer_with_metadata(
    "What gaming laptops do you have?",
    relevant_documents  # 3 documents from catalog
)

# Output
{
    "answer": "We have several gaming laptops including TechBook Pro 15 with RTX 4060...",
    "num_documents_used": 3,
    "has_context": True,
    "sources": ["techmart_catalog.csv"],
    "collections_used": ["catalog"]
}
```

### Example 2: Fallback (no documents)

```python
# Input
result = generate_answer("obscure query", [])

# Output
{
    "answer": "I don't have relevant information about this in our knowledge base...",
    "num_documents_used": 0,
    "has_context": False,
    "sources": [],
    "collections_used": []
}
```

### Example 3: Pipeline integration

```python
# After retrieval, grading, retries
if relevant_documents:
    # Generate with context
    generation_result = generate_answer_with_metadata(
        original_query,  # NOT current_query
        relevant_documents
    )
    print(f"✓ Answer from {generation_result['num_documents_used']} docs")
else:
    # Fallback after exhausting retries
    generation_result = generate_answer(original_query, [])
    print("⚠ Fallback answer (no relevant docs)")

print(generation_result['answer'])
```

### Example 4: Using original vs rewritten query

```python
# Setup
original_query = "gaming laptops"
current_query = "high performance gaming laptop computers RTX graphics"  # Rewritten

# After retrieval with current_query
relevant_docs = filter_relevant_documents(graded_docs)

# Generate with ORIGINAL query
result = generate_answer(original_query, relevant_docs)  # ✓ Correct
# NOT: generate_answer(current_query, relevant_docs)     # ✗ Wrong
```
