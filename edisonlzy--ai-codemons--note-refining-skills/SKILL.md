# Note Refining Skills

## Overview

This skill refines and optimizes notes from codemo.asia into structured, high-quality knowledge documents. It integrates with the @codemons/cli tool to fetch highlights and content, then transforms them into organized knowledge points within the Obsidian knowledge framework.

## Prerequisites

### 1. CLI Availability Check

Before executing any subskill, verify that `codemons-cli` is available:

1. First try running `codemons-cli --version` directly
2. If not available, install it globally: `npm install -g @codemons/cli`
3. Verify installation: `codemons-cli --version`

### 2. Authentication Check

Verify that the user is logged in:

```bash
codemons-cli auth
```

If not logged in (no user info shown), prompt the user:

> You are not logged in to codemo.asia. Please run:
> ```bash
> codemons-cli auth
> ```
> Follow the instructions to complete login.

### 3. Configuration

This skill does not require any configuration. All inputs are provided by the user during execution.
