# marketing-site-design — marketing-surface patterns over the Minsky brand foundation

You are designing or auditing a marketing surface for Minsky (`services/site/` in this monorepo, or any future microsite, launch page, or campaign page). The vendored Tier-1 skills cover visual quality, IA, engineering stack, SEO, and motion. The sibling `analyze-adjacent-product` skill encodes the Peirce-Barthes-Oswald semiotic framework for reading other brands. The sibling `minsky-brand` skill carries the locked brand foundation (myth, cultural code, references, vocabulary). **This skill adds the marketing-surface layer on top of that foundation:** which idiom marketing uses, how marketing pages are structured, what marketing-format anti-patterns are forbidden, and how to run a workshop for a new marketing-surface myth.

If you are pattern-matching against "what other AI startup sites look like" before invoking `minsky-brand` to load the locked myth and code, stop. That order of operations produces the Pepsi/Arnell trap (§2). The order is: load `minsky-brand` → pick the marketing idiom that carries the code → choose the signs that instantiate it on the marketing surface.

## When to invoke

- Designing or rebuilding the Minsky marketing site (`services/site/` in this monorepo; rebuilt under mt#1934 and live at https://minsky-site-production.up.railway.app)
- Designing any adjacent marketing surface (launch microsites, campaign pages, position-paper landing pages)
- Auditing an existing marketing surface against the locked brand register
- Workshopping a brand-positioning myth for a _new_ marketing surface (the locked Minsky myth is in `minsky-brand` §1 — don't re-derive)
- Reviewing a design proposal that arrived without explicit myth-statement
- _(For analyzing an adjacent product's marketing site, use the sibling skill `analyze-adjacent-product` instead — this skill consumes that one's output during §7 workshop Step 4.)_

## 1. Load the brand foundation first

The brand foundation — locked myth (exocortex / flock), cultural code (Cyberbrain / Section 9), five-layer reference architecture, bridge-as-affect discipline, code-architecture synthesis, vocabulary inventory — lives in [`/minsky-brand`](../minsky-brand/SKILL.md). Load it before any marketing-surface decision.

The operational tokens (typography stack, color palette with hex + OKLCH, motion budget, WCAG contrast targets, font licensing, fallback stacks) live in [`docs/brand-system.md`](../../../docs/brand-system.md). Consume those directly when implementing.

The voice substance (Macx-register prose, semicolon rhythm, vocabulary precision, no-go register) lives in [`/pz-voice`](../pz-voice/SKILL.md). Compose with `minsky-brand` per its §8 (signal/channel split) — voice carries WHAT is claimed; cultural codes carry HOW it feels.

This skill begins where those leave off.

## 2. The Pepsi/Arnell trap (marketing-surface application)

Visual choices must instantiate the myth, never retrofit it. The canonical anti-pattern is the 2008 Pepsi rebrand's "Breathtaking" document — semiotic vocabulary as post-hoc theater. The full discussion of the trap and its symmetrical disciplines lives in [`/analyze-adjacent-product`](../analyze-adjacent-product/SKILL.md) §2; the brand-foundation cut lives in [`/minsky-brand`](../minsky-brand/SKILL.md) §6.

For marketing-surface work specifically: if you cannot explain a visual choice on a marketing page as a sign carrying a specific connotation that instantiates the locked myth (per `minsky-brand` §1), cut it.

## 3. Bridge-as-affect (marketing-surface application)

The discipline for invoking emergent cultural codes through residual references the audience already recognizes — without going literal. Full framework discussion in [`/analyze-adjacent-product`](../analyze-adjacent-product/SKILL.md) §3; Minsky-specific application in [`/minsky-brand`](../minsky-brand/SKILL.md) §3.

On a marketing surface specifically: **borrow at the layer of register, never at the layer of imagery.** Specific register-borrowing rules live in `minsky-brand` §3 ("What goes on every surface" / "What never appears"). On marketing pages, the imagery-rejection rules apply with extra force because the marketing context tempts toward "more dramatic" visuals — the Iron Man / JARVIS framing, the Composio-style multicolor saturation, the WebGL-shader hero. The brand foundation forbids all of these; this skill names the marketing-format equivalents in §8 below.

## 4. The competing idioms in AI-product marketing

Empirical observation from the 2026-05 three-way analysis (full version in [`analyze-adjacent-product/references/case-studies-2026-05.md`](../analyze-adjacent-product/references/case-studies-2026-05.md)):

**Idiom A — Motion-decorated infographic** (exemplar: Composio): WebGL shader, centered headlines, multi-color saturated tiles, decorative animation, premium paid typeface. Sells _concept_. Used when the product is invisible plumbing.

**Idiom B — Product-screenshot dominant, restrained** (exemplars: Cursor, Factory): static/near-static hero, left-caption + right-product-screenshot, monochrome dark with minimal accent, real product UI as dominant visual element, free or commissioned typeface, muted customer-logo row. Sells _the actual product_. Used when the product has surfaces worth showing.

**Idiom C — Founder-essay** (exemplar: Macro): long-form first-person prose, principal-as-narrator, embedded artifacts (screenshots, code, diagrams) inside the essay rather than as separate sections. Sells _the principal's frame_. Used when the principal's perspective IS the product's differentiator.

Minsky's primary marketing surface (the site) is **Idiom B** — the CLI, MCP tool calls, cockpit, reviewer-bot PR comments, task graph, memory recall are the surfaces that should carry the pitch; decorative motion would substitute for product proof Minsky already has. Position-paper landing pages and About sections may lean toward **Idiom C** (founder-essay) for the principal-substrate framing.

## 6. The marketing-specific layer — concrete decisions over the brand foundation

The brand foundation (`minsky-brand`) names the cultural code and vocabulary; the operational reference (`docs/brand-system.md`) names the typography, color, motion, and accessibility tokens. **This section names the marketing-surface-specific decisions that compose on top:** idiom selection, layout patterns, product surfaces to show, voice register choices for marketing copy, customer-logo strategy.

### Idiom: B (product-screenshot dominant)

Minsky has product surfaces worth showing; decorative motion would substitute for them. For position-paper landing pages and About sections, lean toward Idiom C (founder-essay) — the principal's voice as the narrator carries the substrate framing per `pz-voice` §7 (the per-surface signal/channel balance).

### Cultural code: see `minsky-brand` §2 and §4

Cyberbrain / Section 9, five-layer reference architecture. Don't re-derive. The marketing surface inherits this foundation directly.

### Layout pattern (marketing-specific)

- **Hero:** left-aligned caption column + right-aligned product proof. Never centered. (Centered hero is Idiom A's signature — see §8 anti-patterns.)
- **Sections:** alternating left/right caption + product screenshot.
- **Customer logo strip:** single muted row of **co-product logos** (Claude Code / Cursor / Codex / MCP / GitHub / Notion / Railway) framed as _"Minsky composes with"_, not _"trusted by."_ Minsky doesn't yet have public customer logos.
- **No sticky-numbered-nav + colored-tile-panel section pattern.** That's Idiom A's signature.

### Motion budget (marketing-specific application)

The full motion budget — five permitted patterns, `prefers-reduced-motion` defaults, 4-OS test matrix — lives in [`docs/brand-system.md`](../../../docs/brand-system.md) §3. On marketing surfaces specifically:

- **Single scroll-driven fade per section** is the appropriate pattern for marketing pages — one per section, no chained per-element staggers. Implementation via `motion-framer` skill.
- **Sync-gauge motif** as a recurring micro-instrument on the marketing surface ties the brand register to a single repeating sign without becoming decorative.
- **No decorative shaders or WebGL.** They signal Idiom A.
- **No multi-system orchestrated motion.** Liveness should come from real product instrumentation (a status dot that reflects actual state), not from decorative continuous animation.
- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`** per `docs/brand-system.md` §3 — required, with the 4-OS test matrix.

### Product surfaces to show (the iconic-sign layer)

Idiom B carries through the homepage — specific Minsky scenes that should appear as real screenshots:

1. CLI output of a session running a real task (`minsky session start --task mt#NNNN` → agent picks up work)
2. MCP tool call result inside Claude Code (e.g., `mcp__minsky__tasks_get`)
3. Cockpit widget showing active workstreams (the mission-control organ inside the larger frame)
4. Reviewer-bot PR comment catching a real contract violation
5. Task graph visualization showing parent/child + dependency edges
6. Memory recall stopping a repeat mistake (search hit, prior incident referenced)
7. A hook denial in action (e.g., the bypass-merge guard blocking a subagent's PUT /merge)
8. The asks subsystem surfacing an attention-required event

Each scene is a real screenshot or terminal recording, not a mockup. The site is the surface where Minsky's substrate becomes visible.

### Voice register (marketing-surface choices)

The brand-vocabulary table lives in [`/minsky-brand`](../minsky-brand/SKILL.md) §7. The Macx-prose rhythm and no-go register live in [`/pz-voice`](../pz-voice/SKILL.md). Marketing-surface-specific choices on top:

- **Section headlines:** three- to four-word conceptual. Examples to noodle on:
  - _"Tasks that converge"_
  - _"Reviews that hold"_
  - _"Memory that compounds"_
  - _"Attention that allocates"_
  - _"Hooks that catch"_
  - _"Asks that escalate"_
- **All-caps for structural labels only** (nav, eyebrows, numbered section markers).
- **CTAs:** sentence case ("Read the docs," "Try the CLI") — never SaaS imperative ("Get started for FREE"). Per `pz-voice` no-go register.
- **No email-capture popup, banner, or footer form.** Reject by default. The mission-control register does not interrupt the user.

### Customer-logo / co-product-logo strategy

Minsky does not yet have public customer logos. Substitute with **co-product logos** — systems Minsky composes with:

- Claude Code, Cursor, Codex (harness compatibility)
- MCP (protocol)
- GitHub, Notion (backend integrations)
- Railway (deploy)
- Bun (runtime)

Frame as _"Minsky composes with"_ — borrows credibility from the named products without claiming customers that do not yet exist.

## 7. Workshop process — how to pick a NEW marketing-surface myth

Use this when pairing with the operator (or self-running) to pick the myth for a _new_ marketing surface (microsite, launch page, campaign page) before any visual work begins. **The Minsky site itself does not need this — its myth is already locked in [`/minsky-brand`](../minsky-brand/SKILL.md) §1.** The first end-to-end walk-through is [`references/minsky-myth-2026-05.md`](references/minsky-myth-2026-05.md) — use it as the worked example.

Each step produces a written artifact; together they constitute the brief.

### Step 1 — Audit the existing category myth

- What proposition do AI-product buyers already accept as obvious before they encounter the brand?
- What does the category's default site say without saying — what myth does it naturalize?
- Output: 1-2 sentences naming the category-default myth.

### Step 2 — Audit the brand's existing corpus

- Walk the strategic docs (position papers, RFCs, manifesto-shaped pages).
- Walk the principal's public corpus (writings, talks, social posts — query the principal-corpus via `mcp__minsky__principal_corpus_search`) for recurring propositions.
- Identify 3-5 candidate myths the existing voice already naturalizes.
- Output: 3-5 candidate myth-statements, each one declarative sentence.

### Step 3 — Test each candidate

For each candidate myth:

- Is it _contestable_? (Would a buyer disagree before encountering the site? Would a competitor find it awkward to claim?)
- Is it _carried by the actual product_? (Can the product surfaces in the "Product surfaces to show" subsection of §6 instantiate this myth?)
- Is it _durable_? (Will it still be true and important in 2-3 years?)
- Is it _aligned with the principal's investment_? (Does the operator want to spend years naturalizing this proposition?)

Output: one selected myth, written as a single declarative sentence.

### Step 4 — Identify the cultural code

Given the selected myth, name the cultural code that carries it. **Invoke the sibling skill `analyze-adjacent-product`** to read adjacent brands and identify which codes are occupied vs. white-space:

- Use the cultural-code-lane discussion in [`/minsky-brand`](../minsky-brand/SKILL.md) §4 as the reference for the Minsky-brand layered architecture; new codes are allowed if justified.
- If the myth lives in an _occupied_ code, name the competitor whose visual register the brand will partially share. Decide which signs to adopt and which to reject.
- If the myth lives in an _available_ code, name the code and its existing exemplars OUTSIDE the AI category (residual codes — see `analyze-adjacent-product` SKILL.md §3 for the bridge-as-affect discipline).

Output: 1 cultural code, with 2-3 exemplars cited. If the code is layered (per `minsky-brand` §5's code-architecture), name each reference and the role it plays.

### Step 5 — Derive the visual specification

Now and only now, derive the visual decisions from the code:

- Typography (display, body, mono) — consume from `docs/brand-system.md` §1 if Minsky-branded; derive new if novel surface.
- Color (background, text, accent) — consume from `docs/brand-system.md` §2.
- Layout pattern (hero, sections, customer logos) — per §6 above.
- Motion budget (ambient, scroll, gesture) — per `docs/brand-system.md` §3 + §6 marketing-specific.
- Product surfaces to show — per §6.
- Vocabulary inventory (brand terms borrowed from the references) — consume from `minsky-brand` §7.

Each decision must be traceable to a sign that instantiates the chosen code. If a proposed decision does not carry the code, drop it.

Output: the brief — myth, code, visual spec, vocabulary.

### Step 6 — Build a first surface, then test the brief

Implement the hero + one feature section. Show it to a buyer-archetype reader. Ask: "what does this site naturalize?" If their answer matches the myth statement, the brief is working. If it does not, the visual choices are instantiating a different code; iterate.

## 7a. Naming the surface (Lexicon framework)

§7 picks the _myth_ for a new marketing surface; this section picks its _name_ — a microsite title, campaign name, launch handle, or a section/feature label that must read as Minsky. The foundation-layer encoding (five principles, sound-symbolism table, compound multiplier, anti-patterns) lives in [`/minsky-brand`](../minsky-brand/SKILL.md) §7.1; for full end-to-end naming work invoke the [`/name-product`](../name-product/SKILL.md) skill. This section is the marketing-surface cut.

**Three-phase methodology (identify → invent → implement)** applied to a marketing surface:

1. **Identify.** Run the bidirectional-behavior question (`minsky-brand` §7.1, principle 5) for _this surface_: how should the audience behave toward it, and it toward them? Run the diamond exercise below to surface the message that becomes the name.
2. **Invent.** Generate candidates in _generative_ mode — suspend evaluation; ask "what could we do with this name?" not "is it good?". Pull from the sound-symbolism table and the compound-multiplier rule in `minsky-brand` §7.1; lean tangible over abstract.
3. **Implement.** Screen survivors for polarization, compound fit, and code-coherence (`minsky-brand` §7.1 three checks) AND the mandatory trademark-collision screen (`name-product`). Only then derive the visual treatment per §7 Step 5.

**The diamond exercise.** Four corners; iterate over days, not an hour:

- **Win** — how do you define winning for this surface?
- **Have to win** — the assets already in hand (locked myth, product proof, corpus).
- **Need to win** — the gaps (what's missing to win).
- **Have to say to win** — the message that closes the gap. _This message is what becomes the name._

**The competitor drill.** Ask a buyer-archetype reader: _"We just got a new competitor and their name is X — what do you think about them?"_ This surfaces what the name does for the imagination, bypassing the evaluative reflex ("is it good?"). Run it on each finalist.

**The not-like-the-other-guys signal.** When a reader says "they're not like the other guys" _before_ they know what the surface is for, the name is working — it has created _predisposition to consider_. This is the marketing-surface read on the same signal `analyze-adjacent-product` reads in competitors.

**Polarization on first hearing.** Per `minsky-brand` §7.1, principle 2: if the team is comfortable with the surface name, it's too safe. Argument is energy, not weakness — don't sand a name down to consensus before launch, or you ship no name at all.

## 8. Anti-patterns (marketing-format specific)

Reject these explicitly. They instantiate Idiom A or AI-slop defaults on a marketing surface. **For brand-foundation anti-patterns** (literal anime, Iron Man / JARVIS, Skynet futurism, mecha imagery, single-reference pastiche) see [`/minsky-brand`](../minsky-brand/SKILL.md) §9.

- **WebGL shader hero.** Signals Idiom A; substitutes decorative motion for product proof.
- **Centered hero text + centered subhead.** Conference-talk register, not operator-control register.
- **Purple gradients + Inter/Roboto + Lucide icons.** The AI-slop trifecta named in landing-page-design conventions; immediate marketing dilution.
- **Multi-color saturated tile panels** (blue + pink + green + cyan rotation). Composio signature; reads as consumer-software.
- **Sticky-numbered-nav + scrolly section pattern.** Composio signature.
- **Anonymous testimonial paragraphs** ("Game-changer for our team!"). Either name the individual (Cursor's Jensen Huang / shadcn / Patrick Collison approach) or omit entirely.
- **Email-capture popup, banner, or footer form.** Reject by default. The mission-control register does not interrupt the user.
- **Hand-wavy "infrastructure for X" copy** without concrete instantiation. State the mechanism, not the metaphor.
- **Pricing presented before the product is understood.** Pricing belongs on its own page, not on the homepage, unless usage-tier-as-positioning is intentional.
- **Long justification copy under a visual.** If a sign needs a paragraph to explain its meaning, the sign is doing the wrong work. Replace it with a sign that carries the meaning directly.

## 9. Worked examples

- **2026-05-19 three-way analysis** of Composio / Cursor / Factory through the Peirce-Barthes-Oswald framework: [`../analyze-adjacent-product/references/case-studies-2026-05.md`](../analyze-adjacent-product/references/case-studies-2026-05.md). This is the canonical worked example of the analytical methodology — read it when running the analyze-adjacent-product workflow.
- **2026-05-19 Minsky myth workshop** end-to-end output: [`references/minsky-myth-2026-05.md`](references/minsky-myth-2026-05.md). Locked brand thesis including myth statement, cultural code with reference rankings, code-architecture synthesis, vocabulary inventory, and the "drawn from, not literally" discipline as applied to Minsky specifically. **This worked example is now codified into [`/minsky-brand`](../minsky-brand/SKILL.md)** — use the reference file when running the workshop for a new surface; use the brand skill when consuming the locked Minsky output.

Captured in [`../analyze-adjacent-product/references/case-studies-2026-05.md`](../analyze-adjacent-product/references/case-studies-2026-05.md) and [`references/minsky-myth-2026-05.md`](references/minsky-myth-2026-05.md).
- mt#1927 — task that installed this skill bundle with the methodology absorbed inline
- mt#1933 — task that extracted the brand foundation into the standalone `minsky-brand` skill (this refactor)
- mt#1944 — task that extracted the analytical methodology into the standalone `analyze-adjacent-product` skill

**Refactor 2026-05-20 (mt#1933):** Extracted the brand foundation — locked myth, cultural code (Cyberbrain / Section 9), five-layer reference architecture, bridge-as-affect Minsky-specific application, code-architecture synthesis, vocabulary inventory, and brand-foundation anti-patterns — into the standalone [`/minsky-brand`](../minsky-brand/SKILL.md) skill. This file now layers marketing-surface-specific patterns (Idiom B, layout, motion-budget marketing application, product surfaces to show, customer-logo strategy, marketing-format anti-patterns, new-surface workshop process) on top of that foundation. Sections renumbered: prior §5 (cultural codes) and §6 (code architecture) moved to `minsky-brand`; prior §7 (vendored bundle) becomes new §5; prior §8 (Minsky-specific layer) becomes new §6 (split — tokens moved to `docs/brand-system.md` per mt#1932; vocabulary moved to `minsky-brand` §7); prior §9 (workshop) becomes new §7; prior §10 (anti-patterns) becomes new §8 with brand-foundation rejects moved to `minsky-brand` §9; prior §11 (worked examples) becomes new §9. The Idiom C (founder-essay) reference was added to §4 to match the 2026-05-19 three-idiom synthesis. No semantic changes to the methodology — same content, relocated for reusability.

**Refactor 2026-05-19 (mt#1944):** Extracted the semiotic-analysis framework, Pepsi/Arnell trap, bridge-as-affect discipline, per-analysis capture workflow, and per-analysis template into the standalone `analyze-adjacent-product` skill. Moved `references/case-studies-2026-05.md` to `../analyze-adjacent-product/references/case-studies-2026-05.md`. No semantic changes to the methodology itself — same content, relocated for reusability.
