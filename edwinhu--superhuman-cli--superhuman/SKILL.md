# Superhuman Email & Calendar Automation

CLI and MCP server to control [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com) email client via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- Superhuman.app running with remote debugging enabled

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
bun install

# Start Superhuman with CDP enabled
/Applications/Superhuman.app/Contents/MacOS/Superhuman --remote-debugging-port=9400
```

### Container / Remote CDP

When running inside a Docker container or connecting to a remote host, set `CDP_HOST`:

```bash
export CDP_HOST=host.docker.internal   # Docker container → host
superhuman account auth                # Extract tokens via remote CDP
```

After initial `account auth`, most operations use cached tokens and don't need CDP. Tokens are stored at `~/.config/superhuman-cli/tokens.json` and auto-refresh via OAuth.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Check connection status
superhuman status

# Account management
superhuman account auth
superhuman account list
superhuman account switch 2
superhuman account switch user@example.com
```

### Reading Email

```bash
# List recent inbox emails
superhuman inbox
superhuman inbox --limit 20 --json

# Search emails
superhuman search "from:john subject:meeting"
superhuman search "project update" --limit 20
superhuman search "from:anthropic" --include-done    # Search all including archived

# Read a specific thread (requires --account)
superhuman read <thread-id> --account user@gmail.com
superhuman read <thread-id> --account user@gmail.com --context 3   # Full body for last 3 only
superhuman read <thread-id> --account user@gmail.com --json
```

### Ask AI

Use Superhuman's AI to search emails, answer questions, or ask about specific threads:

```bash
# Search emails with natural language
superhuman ai "find emails about the Stanford cover letter"
superhuman ai "what did John say about the deadline?"

# Compose with AI
superhuman ai "Write an email inviting the team to a planning meeting"

# Ask about a specific thread
superhuman ai <thread-id> "summarize this thread"
superhuman ai <thread-id> "what are the action items?"
superhuman ai <thread-id> "draft a professional reply"
```

The AI automatically determines whether to search, compose, or answer based on your prompt.

### Contacts

```bash
# Search contacts by name
superhuman contact search "john"
superhuman contact search "john" --limit 5 --json

# Search contacts in a specific account (without switching UI)
superhuman contact search "john" --account user@gmail.com
```

### Multi-Account Support

The `--account` flag allows operations on any linked account without switching the Superhuman UI:

```bash
# Search contacts in a specific account
superhuman contact search "john" --account user@gmail.com

# Works with both Gmail and Microsoft/Outlook accounts
superhuman contact search "john" --account user@company.com
```

**How it works:** The CLI extracts OAuth tokens directly from Superhuman and makes API calls to Gmail or Microsoft Graph. Tokens are cached to disk with automatic background refresh when expiring.

### Token Management

```bash
# Extract and cache tokens from Superhuman (required once)
superhuman account auth

# Tokens are automatically refreshed when expiring
# If refresh fails, you'll see: "Token for user@email.com expired. Run 'superhuman account auth' to re-authenticate."
```

Tokens are stored in `~/.config/superhuman-cli/tokens.json` and automatically refreshed using OAuth refresh tokens when they expire (within 5 minutes of expiry). No CDP connection is needed for token refresh.

### Composing Email

Recipients can be specified as email addresses or contact names. Names are automatically resolved to email addresses via contact search.

```bash
# Create a draft (using email or name)
superhuman draft create --to user@example.com --subject "Hello" --body "Hi there!"
superhuman draft create --to "john" --subject "Hello" --body "Hi there!"

# List drafts (shows both provider and native Superhuman drafts)
superhuman draft list
superhuman draft list --account user@example.com

# Send an email
superhuman send --to user@example.com --subject "Quick note" --body "FYI"

# Reply to a thread
superhuman reply <thread-id> --body "Thanks!"
superhuman reply <thread-id> --body "Thanks!" --send

# Reply-all
superhuman reply-all <thread-id> --body "Thanks everyone!"

# Forward
superhuman forward <thread-id> --to colleague@example.com --body "FYI"

# Update a draft
superhuman draft update <draft-id> --body "Updated content"

# Delete drafts
superhuman draft delete <draft-id>
superhuman draft delete <draft-id1> <draft-id2>

# Send a draft by ID
superhuman send --draft <draft-id>

# Send a Superhuman draft with content
superhuman draft send <draft-id> --account=user@example.com --to=recipient@example.com --subject="Subject" --body="Body"
```

#### Draft Sources

The `draft list` command shows drafts from multiple sources with a "Source" column:

| Source | Description | Example ID |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `native` | Superhuman-only drafts | `draft00ce4679cc58a64c` |
| `gmail` | Synced to Gmail | Gmail message ID |
| `outlook` | Synced to Outlook | Outlook message ID |

Native Superhuman drafts (IDs starting with `draft00...`) are fetched from Superhuman's backend API and only exist in Superhuman. Provider-synced drafts are fetched from Gmail/Outlook APIs and are visible in native email clients.

#### Drafts Limitation

Drafts created via `draft create` use **native Gmail/Outlook APIs**, not Superhuman's proprietary draft system. This means:

| Where | Visible? |
|-------|----------|
| Native Gmail/Outlook web | Yes |
| Native mobile apps | Yes |
| Superhuman UI | No |

This is acceptable for CLI workflows where you iterate on drafts with LLMs and send via `--send` flag. If you need to edit in Superhuman UI, open the draft in native Gmail/Outlook first.

### Managing Threads

```bash
# Archive
superhuman archive <thread-id>
superhuman archive <thread-id1> <thread-id2>

# Delete (trash)
superhuman delete <thread-id>

# Mark as read/unread
superhuman mark read <thread-id>
superhuman mark unread <thread-id>

# Star / Unstar
superhuman star add <thread-id>
superhuman star remove <thread-id>
superhuman star list

# Snooze / Unsnooze
superhuman snooze set <thread-id> --until tomorrow
superhuman snooze set <thread-id> --until next-week
superhuman snooze set <thread-id> --until "2024-02-15T14:00:00Z"
superhuman snooze cancel <thread-id>
superhuman snooze list
```

### Snippets

Reusable email templates stored in Superhuman. Snippets support template variables like `{first_name}`.

```bash
# List all snippets
superhuman snippet list
superhuman snippet list --json

# Use a snippet to create a draft (fuzzy name matching)
superhuman snippet use "zoom link" --to user@example.com

# Substitute template variables
superhuman snippet use "share recordings" --to user@example.com --vars "date=Feb 5,student_name=Jane"

# Send immediately using a snippet
superhuman snippet use "share recordings" --to user@example.com --vars "date=Feb 5" --send
```

### Labels

```bash
# List all labels
superhuman label list

# Get labels on a thread
superhuman label get <thread-id>

# Add/remove labels
superhuman label add <thread-id> --label Label_123
superhuman label remove <thread-id> --label Label_123
```

### Attachments

```bash
# List attachments in a thread
superhuman attachment list <thread-id>

# Download all attachments from a thread
superhuman attachment download <thread-id>
superhuman attachment download <thread-id> --output ./downloads

# Download specific attachment
superhuman attachment download --attachment <attachment-id> --message <message-id> --output ./file.pdf
```

### Calendar

Superhuman has built-in calendar support, but prefer `morgen` CLI for calendar operations — it supports proper calendar filtering. See the `morgen` skill.

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--account <email>` | Account to operate on (default: current account) |
| `--to <email\|name>` | Recipient email or name (names auto-resolved via contacts) |
| `--cc <email\|name>` | CC recipient (can be used multiple times) |
| `--bcc <email\|name>` | BCC recipient (can be used multiple times) |
| `--subject <text>` | Email subject |
| `--body <text>` | Email body (plain text, converted to HTML) |
| `--html <text>` | Email body as raw HTML |
| `--send` | Send immediately instead of saving draft (for reply/reply-all/forward/snippet) |
| `--vars <pairs>` | Template variable substitution: `"key1=val1,key2=val2"` (for snippet use) |
| `--draft <id>` | Draft ID to send (for send command) |
| `--label <id>` | Label ID (for label add/remove) |
| `--until <time>` | Snooze until time: preset or ISO datetime |
| `--output <path>` | Output path for downloads |
| `--attachment <id>` | Specific attachment ID |
| `--message <id>` | Message ID (required with --attachment) |
| `--limit <number>` | Number of results (default: 10) |
| `--include-done` | Search all emails including archived (for search) |
| `--context <number>` | Number of messages to show full body (default: all, for read) |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |
| `--port <number>` | CDP port (default: 9400) |

## Common Workflows

### Triage Inbox

```bash
superhuman inbox --limit 20
superhuman read <thread-id> --account user@gmail.com
superhuman archive <thread-id1> <thread-id2>
superhuman snooze set <thread-id> --until tomorrow
superhuman star add <thread-id>
```

### Reply to Email

For **drafting** replies (recommended — lets the user review before sending):
```bash
superhuman read <thread-id> --account user@gmail.com
superhuman reply <thread-id> --body "Thanks for the update."
```

For **sending** replies immediately:
```bash
superhuman reply <thread-id> --body "Thanks for the update." --send
```

If `superhuman reply` fails (e.g. MS Graph 400 error on Outlook accounts), use the AI approach:
```bash
superhuman ai <thread-id> "draft a professional reply saying thanks for the update"
```

### Search and Process

```bash
superhuman search "from:boss@company.com" --limit 10
superhuman search "is:unread has:attachment"
superhuman search "from:anthropic" --include-done    # Include archived
```

### Multi-Account

```bash
superhuman account list
superhuman account switch work@company.com
superhuman contact search "john" --account personal@gmail.com
```

### Snippets

```bash
superhuman snippet list
superhuman snippet use "meeting invite" --to colleague@example.com --vars "date=Feb 10" --send
```

## Snooze Presets

| Preset | When |
|--------|------|
| `tomorrow` | 9am next day |
| `next-week` | 9am next Monday |
| `weekend` | 9am Saturday |
| `evening` | 6pm today |
| ISO datetime | Exact time (e.g., `2024-02-15T14:00:00Z`) |

## Output Formats

Most commands support `--json` for structured output:

```bash
superhuman inbox --json | jq '.[] | {id, subject, from}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Token Expired

```bash
superhuman account auth    # Re-extract tokens from Superhuman
```

Tokens auto-refresh. If refresh fails: `Token for user@email.com expired. Run 'superhuman account auth' to re-authenticate.`

### Connection Failed

1. Check if Superhuman is installed at `/Applications/Superhuman.app`
2. Launch with debugging: `/Applications/Superhuman.app/Contents/MacOS/Superhuman --remote-debugging-port=9400`
3. Verify: `superhuman status`

**From a container**: Ensure `CDP_HOST=host.docker.internal` is set and the container was started with `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`. The CLI skips local app launch when `CDP_HOST` is non-localhost.

### Thread Not Found

Thread IDs come from inbox/search. Use `--json` to get exact IDs:

```bash
superhuman inbox --json | jq '.[0].id'
```

## How It Works

### Direct API (Primary)

Most operations use **direct Gmail API and Microsoft Graph API** calls with cached OAuth tokens:

| Operation | Gmail API | MS Graph API |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| List inbox | `GET /messages?q=label:INBOX` | `GET /mailFolders/Inbox/messages` |
| Search | `GET /messages?q=...` | `GET /messages?$search=...` |
| Labels | `POST /threads/{id}/modify` | `PATCH /messages/{id}` |
| Read status | Add/remove UNREAD label | `PATCH /messages/{id}` with `isRead` |
| Archive | Remove INBOX label | `POST /messages/{id}/move` |
| Star | Add STARRED label | `PATCH /messages/{id}` with `flag` |
| Attachments | `GET /messages/{id}/attachments/{id}` | `GET /messages/{id}/attachments/{id}` |
| Contacts | Google People API | MS Graph People API |
| Snippets | Superhuman backend API | Superhuman backend API |

OAuth tokens (including refresh tokens) are extracted from Superhuman and cached to disk. When tokens expire, they are automatically refreshed via OAuth endpoints without requiring CDP connection.

### CDP (Secondary)

Chrome DevTools Protocol is only needed for:

- `account auth` — One-time token extraction from `window.GoogleAccount` (also stores AI user prefix)
- `status` — Check Superhuman connection
- `search` / `inbox` (when no cached tokens) — Fallback via Superhuman's portal API

All other operations (read, reply, forward, draft, archive, delete, labels, star, snooze, attachments, contacts, snippets) use direct API with cached tokens.

### Benefits

- **Reliability**: Direct API calls don't depend on Superhuman's UI state
- **Speed**: No CDP round-trips for most operations
- **Offline from CDP**: After initial `account auth`, most operations work without CDP
- **Multi-account**: Cached tokens enable operating on any linked account

Supports both Gmail and Microsoft/Outlook accounts.
