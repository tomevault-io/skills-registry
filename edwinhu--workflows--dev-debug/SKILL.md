## STEP ZERO — INITIALIZE THE DEBUG LOOP

Your first actions are, in order:
1. Create/update .planning/HYPOTHESES.md (the durable memory across iterations)
2. Spawn the first investigation subagent

**Do NOT read project code. Do NOT form hypotheses. Do NOT "gather context." All investigation happens inside subagents with fresh context.**

### The Cognitive Lock

Until you spawn the first subagent, you cannot: Read files, Edit code, Run commands, Grep for patterns, "Just quickly check" anything, Form hypotheses, or Analyze prior context. **All tools LOCKED until first subagent is spawned.**

### Why This Exists

On March 6-7, 2026, an agent loaded dev-debug TWICE and both times rationalized skipping the loop. Result: 19MB transcript, 15K lines, 30 "root cause found" claims, 6+ theories, zero resolution. The session was killed.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Architecture: Fresh Subagent Loop With Progress Gating

**No ralph-loop. No promises. No honor system.** The main chat runs its own loop. Each iteration is a fresh subagent. The loop runs autonomously as long as subagents make meaningful progress. The user is only pulled in when the loop stalls.

```
Main chat (thin orchestrator)
  │
  ├─ Initialize .planning/HYPOTHESES.md
  │
  ├─ LOOP:
  │   ├─ Spawn fresh subagent → investigate/fix
  │   ├─ Subagent returns structured report
  │   ├─ Evaluate progress (see stall detection below)
  │   │
  │   ├─ MEANINGFUL PROGRESS?
  │   │   YES → iterate automatically (spawn next subagent)
  │   │   NO  → escalate to user
  │   │
  │   └─ SUBAGENT CLAIMS FIXED?
  │       → Run the test command yourself
  │       → Pass? → DONE
  │       → Fail? → log false positive, iterate
  │
  └─ Max 10 iterations without resolution → escalate to user
```

### Why This Design

- **Fresh subagent per iteration**: No context pollution. Each subagent reads state from .planning/HYPOTHESES.md, not from 15K lines of prior conversation.
- **No ralph-loop dependency**: The exit condition is progress, not a promise the agent can fake.
- **User only involved when needed**: Autonomous when making progress, escalates when stuck.
- **Test as structural gate**: When the subagent claims FIXED, main chat runs the test. The agent can't lie about test output.

**Progress lives in files, not in conversation.**

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## The Iron Law of Delegation

**MAIN CHAT MUST NOT TOUCH THE CODEBASE. EVER.**

Main chat does exactly four things:
1. Initialize .planning/HYPOTHESES.md
2. Spawn fresh subagents
3. Evaluate progress between iterations
4. Run the regression test when a subagent claims FIXED

| Tool | Main Chat? | Subagent? |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| `Read` (project files) | **NO** | YES |
| `Read` (.planning/HYPOTHESES.md) | **YES** — for progress evaluation | YES |
| `Edit` / `Write` | **NO** | YES |
| `Grep` / `Glob` | **NO** | YES |
| `Bash` (project commands) | **ONLY** to run regression test | YES |
| `Agent` (spawn subagent) | **YES** — this is your job | — |

**Why?** The moment you read code, you form opinions. Opinions bias hypotheses. You end up editing directly. This is how the 19MB transcript happened.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## The Iron Law of Verification vs Investigation

**Running the test suite IS verification. Reading source code IS investigation. If you need to READ CODE to "verify," you need a SUBAGENT, not verification.**

This distinction exists because on March 16, 2026, an agent rationalized reading source code, grepping project files, and running docker exec commands as "verification" after a subagent returned. It was investigation disguised as verification. 71 protocol violations followed.

| Verification (main chat CAN do) | Investigation (main chat CANNOT do) |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `vitest run` / `npm test` | `grep` / `rg` in source code |
| `git diff HEAD -- '*.test.*'` | `Read()` any project source file |
| Read .planning/HYPOTHESES.md / .planning/LEARNINGS.md | `docker exec` into containers |
| Check test exit code | Read application logs |
| `git status` / `git log` | Query databases (`sqlite3`, etc.) |
| | `curl` / `wget` to test endpoints |
| | Inspect process state / env vars |

**The test command is the ONLY Bash command main chat runs on the project.** Everything else — log reading, container inspection, database queries, curl testing, env var checking — is investigation. Delegate it.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## The Iron Law of Topic Changes

**If the user sends a message that is NOT about the current debug bug, you MUST announce the loop pause before responding.**

On March 16, 2026, the user asked "What's in spotless db" mid-debug-loop. The assistant silently abandoned the protocol, ran 15+ direct database queries, and never resumed the debug loop. The user had to re-invoke dev-debug.

**Protocol:**
1. Announce: "Pausing dev-debug loop to address your request."
2. Handle the off-topic request (normal tools allowed — you're outside the loop)
3. Announce: "Resuming dev-debug loop. Reading .planning/HYPOTHESES.md for current state."
4. Read .planning/HYPOTHESES.md and spawn the next subagent

**If the user's message could be interpreted as EITHER a new topic OR part of the debug:**
- Ask: "Is this related to the current debug, or a separate request?"
- Do NOT assume it's separate and abandon the loop silently

**Silent loop abandonment is NOT HELPFUL — the user invoked dev-debug because they want structured debugging. Silently dropping the structure wastes their explicit request.**
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## The Process

### Step 1: Initialize State

Create .planning/HYPOTHESES.md if it doesn't exist (ensure .planning/ directory exists first):

```markdown
# Debug Hypotheses

## Bug: [SYMPTOM]
Started: [timestamp]

## Iteration Log
(subagents will append here)
```

If .planning/HYPOTHESES.md already exists (resumed session), read it to understand current state.

### Context Monitoring

Before spawning each subagent iteration, check context availability:

| Level | Remaining Context | Action |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| Normal | >35% | Spawn next subagent |
| Warning | 25-35% | Complete current iteration evaluation, then write .planning/HYPOTHESES.md and invoke dev-handoff |
| Critical | ≤25% | Write .planning/HYPOTHESES.md immediately, invoke dev-handoff |

**Why:** Debug loops can run 10+ iterations. Without monitoring, the orchestrator degrades and loses track of hypotheses tested vs. remaining.

### Step 2: Spawn Investigation Subagent

Each iteration spawns exactly ONE fresh subagent with this prompt (fill in brackets):

```
Agent(subagent_type="workflows:dev-debugger", prompt="""
## Your Task

Debug this issue: [SYMPTOM]

## Prior Work

Read .planning/HYPOTHESES.md FIRST. It contains all previously tested hypotheses.
Read .planning/LEARNINGS.md if it exists for accumulated codebase knowledge.

**Do NOT re-test hypotheses marked REFUTED.** Build on what's known.

## Debug Protocol (5 Phases — Sequential, No Skipping)

### Phase 0: Triage
- Read .planning/HYPOTHESES.md — what has been tried?
- Check service status, process state, recent logs
- Inspect config files in the bug path
- Review recent changes: git log --oneline -10, git diff

### Phase 1: Reproduce
- Write a test that reproduces the bug (or identify an existing failing test)
- If you can't reproduce it, document what you tried
- Document: "Reproduced with [test], output: [error]"

### Phase 2: Investigate
- Trace data flow through the code
- Compare working vs broken code paths
- Add targeted debug logging if needed
- Document findings in .planning/LEARNINGS.md

### Phase 3: Hypothesize and Test
- Form ONE specific hypothesis based on investigation
- Log it in .planning/HYPOTHESES.md BEFORE testing:

  ## Iteration N: [specific hypothesis]
  - Prediction: If correct, then [observable outcome]
  - Test: [exact steps]
  - Result: [CONFIRMED / REFUTED]
  - Evidence: [what you observed]
  - Files changed: [list]
  - New information learned: [what we now know]

- Test with minimal change
- Update .planning/HYPOTHESES.md with result

### Phase 4: Fix (ONLY if hypothesis CONFIRMED)

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
**NO FIX WITHOUT A NEW FAILING REGRESSION TEST FIRST. This is not negotiable.**

Steps in order — no skipping:
1. Write a NEW test that specifically reproduces this bug (in the relevant test file)
2. Run it — it MUST FAIL (proves the test actually catches this bug)
3. ONLY THEN implement the minimal fix
4. Run the test again — it MUST PASS

**"Existing tests already cover this"** is NOT acceptable. If they covered it, the bug wouldn't have shipped. Write a new test. Name it after the bug.

**If you applied the fix before writing the failing test: DELETE the fix entirely. Write the failing test. Confirm it fails. Then re-implement.**
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

- Write regression test FIRST — run it, confirm output shows FAIL
- Implement minimal fix
- Run regression test — confirm output shows PASS
- Run full test suite — no new failures
- Document fix and test command in .planning/LEARNINGS.md

## Output Format

Return this EXACT structure:

STATUS: [INVESTIGATING | FIXED | BLOCKED]
HYPOTHESIS: [what you tested]
RESULT: [CONFIRMED | REFUTED | INCONCLUSIVE]
EVIDENCE: [what you observed — be specific]
NEW INFORMATION: [what we learned that we didn't know before]
REGRESSION TEST: [exact command to run, or 'not yet']
FIX APPLIED: [description, or 'not yet']
REMAINING UNKNOWNS: [what's still unclear]
CONFIDENCE: [LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH — and why]

## Rules
- ONE hypothesis per invocation
- Write to .planning/HYPOTHESES.md as you go
- If FIXED: REGRESSION TEST field must name the SPECIFIC NEW TEST written for this bug (e.g., `test_route_strips_internal_tags in src/routing.test.ts`). "Existing tests pass" is not acceptable.
- If BLOCKED: explain specifically what information you need

## Regression Test Rationalizations — STOP If You Think:

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Existing tests already cover this behavior" | If they covered it, the bug wouldn't exist. Write a NEW test. |
| "The existing test is close enough" | Close ≠ the same. A test for the right bug must fail before the fix. |
| "The test would be identical to an existing one" | Then show which existing test fails with this bug present. If none fail, none cover it. |
| "The fix is a one-liner, a test is overkill" | One-liners are the regressions that come back silently next month. |
| "I'll add a test in a follow-up" | "Follow-up" means "never." The regression test is part of this fix, not a separate task. |
""")
```

### Step 3: Evaluate Progress

After the subagent returns, read .planning/HYPOTHESES.md and evaluate:

**Continue autonomously if ANY of these are true:**
- A new hypothesis was tested (not a repeat of a previous one)
- New information was discovered (files, code paths, behaviors not previously known)
- A hypothesis was CONFIRMED but fix isn't complete yet
- The subagent identified a clear next investigation angle

**Escalate to user if ANY of these are true:**

| Stall Signal | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| Hypothesis repeats a previously REFUTED one | Going in circles |
| No new entries in .planning/HYPOTHESES.md | Subagent didn't follow protocol |
| RESULT is INCONCLUSIVE with no new information | Spinning wheels |
| Subagent reports BLOCKED | Needs domain knowledge or access |
| 3+ consecutive REFUTED hypotheses | Diminishing returns |
| STATUS is FIXED but test fails when you run it | False positive — need user judgment |
| Changes are cosmetic (whitespace, comments, renames) | Not making real progress |

**When escalating, present:**
```
I've run N iterations of debugging. Here's where we are:

HYPOTHESES TESTED:
- [list from .planning/HYPOTHESES.md with results]

WHAT WE'VE RULED OUT:
- [summary]

WHAT WE'VE LEARNED:
- [key findings from .planning/LEARNINGS.md]

I'm stuck because: [specific stall reason]

Options:
A) Continue investigating [specific new angle]
B) You provide domain knowledge about [specific question]
C) Pair debug — I'll show you what I see, you guide
D) Accept as blocker and document
```

### Step 4: Verify Fix

When a subagent reports STATUS: FIXED:

**Gate 1: Verify a NEW regression test was written**

1. Check the REGRESSION TEST field in the subagent report:
   - `not yet` → false positive (skipped TDD). Log in .planning/HYPOTHESES.md. Spawn next iteration with explicit instruction: "Phase 4 requires writing a NEW failing test FIRST. Report the specific test name and file."
   - Vague value (`existing tests pass`, `full suite passes`, `not applicable`) → false positive. Same action.
   - Must be specific: e.g., `test_route_strips_internal_tags in src/routing.test.ts`

2. Verify a test file was actually modified: `Bash("cd [project_root] && git diff HEAD -- '*.test.*' '*.spec.*' | head -5")`
   - No output (no test file changed) → false positive. Revert the fix (`git stash`), log in .planning/HYPOTHESES.md, spawn next iteration: "No regression test was written. Phase 4 requires a new failing test before the fix."

**Gate 2: Verify the test passes**

3. **Run the test yourself**: `Bash("[test command from subagent report]")`
4. **Did it pass?**
   - YES → Run the full test suite too. All green? → **Bug is fixed. Report to user.**
   - NO → Log in .planning/HYPOTHESES.md as false positive. Continue loop.

**If a subagent's fix is a false positive, DELETE the fix entirely. Do not patch — revert and spawn a fresh subagent with updated context.**

**Two structural gates:** (1) a new regression test exists in a modified test file; (2) that test passes. The subagent can't fake either — the main chat verifies both independently.

### Step 5: Report Resolution

When the bug is confirmed fixed:

```
Bug fixed after N iterations.

ROOT CAUSE: [from .planning/LEARNINGS.md]
FIX: [what changed]
REGRESSION TEST: [path and command]
HYPOTHESES TESTED: [count] ([count] refuted, 1 confirmed)
```

## Hypothesis Discipline

### One At A Time

When you test multiple hypotheses simultaneously:
- If the bug disappears, you don't know which change fixed it
- If it persists, you haven't cleanly ruled out any hypothesis
- You learn NOTHING from the iteration

**One hypothesis. One subagent. One result. Logged in .planning/HYPOTHESES.md.**

### The "Root Cause Found" Trap

You may NOT claim "root cause found" unless:
1. You have a regression test that reproduces the bug
2. Your fix makes that test pass
3. You can explain WHY the bug occurred (mechanism, not just location)

**"I found the line that's wrong" is NOT root cause.**

### Drive-Aligned Framing

**Claiming "root cause found" without a reproducing test that fails before the fix and passes after is NOT HELPFUL — the bug comes back next week and you've wasted the user's time, not saved it.** Your hypothesis is not a root cause. Your confidence is not evidence.

## GUI Application Debugging

When debugging GUI apps, subagents MUST complete execution gates:

```
BUILD → LAUNCH (with logging) → WAIT → CHECK PROCESS → READ LOGS → VERIFY
```

**Only after reading logs can you claim "bug reproduced" or "bug fixed."**

## Rationalization Prevention

**If ANY of these thoughts cross your mind, spawn a subagent instead of acting on them.**

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Let me analyze what we know first" | That's the subagent's job. Spawn one. |
| "I have a strong hypothesis already" | You thought that 30 times last time. Spawn a subagent. |
| "Let me gather context first" | Context gathering IS investigation. Subagent. |
| "Let me just quickly check one thing" | "One thing" becomes 50 file reads. Subagent. |
| "This is a simple bug, no loop needed" | 19MB transcript was a "simple" bug. Loop. |
| "I already know the codebase" | You claimed root cause 30 times. You were wrong 30 times. |
| "Subagents are slow, I'll do it myself" | You lose objectivity and can't revert cleanly |
| "I can test two hypotheses at once" | Neither confirmed nor refuted. You learned nothing. |
| "Let me verify the subagent's work by reading the code" | Running the TEST is verification. Reading CODE is investigation. Subagent. |
| "This error is urgent/persistent, I need to act now" | Urgency is EXACTLY when you need the protocol. You'll do 50 commands and still need a subagent. |
| "Let me check the logs/container/database real quick" | Log reading IS investigation. Docker exec IS investigation. DB queries ARE investigation. Subagent. |
| "The user asked about something else, I'll just handle it" | Announce the pause. Don't silently abandon the loop. |
| "I'll just check one thing before spawning the subagent" | That's what happened on March 16: "one thing" became 50 commands. Spawn first, check never. |
| "The subagent won't know how to docker exec / curl / read logs" | Subagents have full tool access. They CAN do operational debugging. You CANNOT. |

### The Confidence Trap

**The more confident you feel, the MORE you need the protocol.** High confidence = strong prior = resistance to disconfirming evidence.

### Observed Escape Patterns (March 16, 2026 — nanoclaw audit)

An agent loaded dev-debug and committed 71 protocol violations. The user had to re-invoke dev-debug 3 times. Only 3 of 15 subagent spawns were properly delegated. These are the EXACT patterns that caused the escape:

**Escape A: "Verification" Rationalization**
After a subagent returned, main chat "verified" by grepping source code, reading setup scripts, diagnosing root causes. It called this "verification." It was investigation.
- STOP trigger: If you're about to Read/Grep/Glob ANY file that isn't .planning/HYPOTHESES.md or .planning/LEARNINGS.md after a subagent returns → STOP. That's investigation. Spawn a subagent.

**Escape B: Silent Loop Abandonment**
User asked "What's in spotless db" — a different topic. Main chat silently abandoned the debug loop and never resumed.
- STOP trigger: If the user's message isn't about the current bug → STOP. Announce the pause. Handle request. Announce resume. Read .planning/HYPOTHESES.md. Spawn next subagent.

**Escape C: Urgency Bypass**
A new 500 error appeared. Main chat "urgently" checked logs, diagnosed the 14MB session, remediated, and read source code. 20+ direct investigation commands.
- STOP trigger: If a new error appears and you feel urgency → STOP. Urgency is EXACTLY when you break protocol. Update .planning/HYPOTHESES.md with the new symptom. Spawn a subagent.

**Escape D: Pre-Delegation Investigation**
Persistent 400 errors appeared. Main chat ran 50+ lines of docker exec, curl, env inspection, log analysis, source reading BEFORE spawning a subagent. By the time it delegated, it had already done all the investigation.
- STOP trigger: If you're about to run docker exec, curl, sqlite3, or read logs → STOP. These are investigation tools. Spawn a subagent with the symptom description. Let the subagent investigate.

## Why Skipping Hurts the Thing You Care About Most

| Your Drive | Why You Skip | What Actually Happens | The Drive You Failed |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Helpfulness** | "Faster = more helpful" | 19MB transcript, zero resolution | **Anti-helpful** |
| **Competence** | "I already know" | 30 wrong root cause claims | **Incompetent** |
| **Efficiency** | "Protocol is overhead" | Protocol: 30 min. Shortcut: 3+ hours | **Inefficient** |
| **Approval** | "User wants results now" | User killed your session | **Trust destroyed** |

**The protocol is not overhead you pay. It is the service you provide.**

## No Pause Between Iterations

After evaluating a subagent's results, IMMEDIATELY spawn the next iteration or complete. Do NOT:
- Summarize what was learned (.planning/HYPOTHESES.md is the record)
- Ask "should I continue?" (progress gating decides, not courtesy)
- Wait for user confirmation between iterations
- Write status updates before spawning next subagent

**Pausing between iterations is procrastination disguised as courtesy.**

## When Fix Requires Substantial Changes

If root cause reveals need for significant refactoring:
1. Document root cause in .planning/LEARNINGS.md
2. Report findings to user
3. Immediately invoke the dev workflow for implementation:

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../skills/dev/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.

Debug finds the problem. The dev workflow implements the solution.

**Do NOT leave the user to manually invoke `/dev`. Chain to it explicitly.**
