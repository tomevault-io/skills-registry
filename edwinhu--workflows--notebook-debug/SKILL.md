description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "debug notebook", "inspect notebook outputs", "find notebook error", "read traceback from ipynb", "why did notebook fail", or needs to understand runtime errors in executed Jupyter notebooks from any source (marimo, jupytext, papermill). Use when this capability is needed.

# Debugging Executed Notebooks

This skill covers inspecting executed `.ipynb` files to debug runtime errors, regardless of how the notebook was created (marimo, jupytext, or plain Jupyter).

**If debugging within a /ds workflow**, first read `.planning/LEARNINGS.md` for pipeline context and `.planning/PLAN.md` for task expectations.

## Verification Enforcement

### IRON LAW: NO 'NOTEBOOK WORKS' CLAIM WITHOUT TRACEBACK CHECK

Before claiming ANY notebook executed successfully, you MUST:
1. **EXECUTE** the notebook to ipynb with outputs
2. **CHECK** for tracebacks (Quick Failure Check section)
3. **READ** the ipynb file with Read tool if errors found
4. **VERIFY** all cells have execution_count (not null)
5. **INSPECT** outputs for warnings/unexpected behavior
6. **CLAIM** success only after all verification passes

This is not negotiable. Skipping traceback checks is NOT HELPFUL — the user opens a notebook that throws errors on first run.

### Rationalization Table - STOP If You Think:

| Excuse | Reality | Do Instead |
|--------|---------|------------|
| "The command succeeded, so notebook works" | Exit code 0 ≠ no errors | CHECK for tracebacks in outputs |
| "I'll just run the source file directly" | You'll miss cell-level errors | EXECUTE to ipynb first, then inspect |
| "User will see errors when they run it" | You're wasting their time | VERIFY before claiming completion |
| "I can see the code, so I know it works" | Code that looks right can still fail | EXECUTE and READ outputs |
| "Quick check with grep is enough" | Grep misses stderr and cell outputs | Use BOTH quick check AND Read tool |
| "Only the last cell matters" | Middle cells can fail silently | VERIFY all cells executed (execution_count) |
| "I'll fix errors if user reports them" | Proactive checking is your job | CHECK before user sees it |

### Drive-Aligned Framing

| Shortcut | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| Skipping cell-by-cell trace | You jumped to the error cell without tracing data flow. The root cause is 5 cells upstream — your shortcut missed it. |
| Fixing without reproducing | You applied a fix without reproducing the error first. The fix is wrong — your confidence was negligence. |

### Red Flags - STOP Immediately If You Think:

- "Let me run marimo/jupytext and assume it worked" → NO. Execute to ipynb and CHECK outputs.
- "The notebook ran last time, so it still works" → NO. Fresh execution EVERY time.
- "I can tell from the code that it's correct" → NO. Code inspection ≠ runtime verification.
- "Just a small change, can't break anything" → NO. Small changes cause big failures.

### Verification Checklist

Before claiming "notebook works":

**Execution:**
- [ ] Execute notebook to ipynb format
- [ ] Use `--include-outputs` flag (for marimo)
- [ ] Verify output file created successfully
- [ ] Verify output file is non-empty

**Traceback Check:**
- [ ] Run quick failure check: `jq -r '.cells[].outputs[]?.text[]?' | grep "Traceback"`
- [ ] Check error count: `jq '[.cells[].outputs[]? | select(.output_type == "error")] | length'`
- [ ] Use Read tool to inspect full context if errors found

**Cell Execution:**
- [ ] Verify all cells have execution_count (no null values)
- [ ] Check execution order is sequential (no out-of-order cells)
- [ ] Verify no cells skipped due to prior failures

**Output Inspection:**
- [ ] Verify critical outputs (not just absence of errors)
- [ ] Check expected results present (dataframes, plots, metrics)
- [ ] Verify no warnings that indicate problems
- [ ] Check no unexpected NaN/None/empty results

**Claim success only after:**
- [ ] All checks pass: declare "notebook executed successfully"

### Gate Function: Notebook Verification

Apply this verification sequence for every notebook debugging task:

```
1. EXECUTE → Run to ipynb with outputs
2. CHECK   → Quick traceback/error count check
3. READ    → Full inspection with Read tool if errors
4. VERIFY  → All cells executed, outputs as expected
5. CLAIM   → "Notebook works" only after all gates passed
```

**Never skip any gate.** Each gate catches different failure modes.

## Why Execute to ipynb?

Converting and executing notebooks to ipynb captures:
- Cell outputs and return values
- Tracebacks with full context
- Execution order and cell IDs

This makes debugging much easier than reading raw `.py` source.

## Execution Commands

```bash
# Export marimo notebook to ipynb with outputs
marimo export ipynb notebook.py -o __marimo__/notebook.ipynb --include-outputs

# Convert jupytext to ipynb and execute with outputs
jupytext --to notebook --output - script.py | papermill - output.ipynb

# Execute existing ipynb notebook to capture outputs
papermill input.ipynb output.ipynb
```

## Inspection Methods

|                  | jq                            | Read tool           |
|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Output           | Raw JSON with escaped strings | Clean rendered view |
| Error visibility | Buried in outputs array       | Inline after cell   |
| Cell context     | Need to piece together        | Cell IDs visible    |
| Scripting        | Better for automation         | Not scriptable      |

**Verdict:** Use Read for debugging/inspection, jq for scripting/CI.

## Quick Failure Check

```bash
# Check for tracebacks in notebook outputs
jq -r '.cells[].outputs[]?.text[]?' notebook.ipynb | grep "Traceback"

# Count error outputs in notebook
jq '[.cells[].outputs[]? | select(.output_type == "error")] | length' notebook.ipynb
```

## Read Tool for Debugging

The Read tool renders ipynb with errors inline after the failing cell:

```
<cell id="MJUe">raise ValueError("intentional error")</cell>

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/path/to/notebook.py", line 5, in <module>
    raise ValueError("intentional error")
ValueError: intentional error

<cell id="vblA">y = x + 10  # depends on x, not the error cell</cell>
```

Benefits:
- Errors appear immediately after the cell that caused them
- Cell IDs visible for cross-referencing
- Full traceback with line numbers
- No JSON parsing needed

## Common Patterns

### Find the Failing Cell

Use the Read tool to inspect the notebook and locate tracebacks:
```bash
# Read notebook to find traceback location inline after failing cell
Read __marimo__/notebook.ipynb
```

### Check Cell Execution Count

Identify cells that did not execute:
```bash
# Find cells with null execution_count (not executed)
jq '.cells[] | select(.execution_count == null) | .source[:50]' notebook.ipynb
```

### Extract All Errors

Gather all error outputs from executed cells:
```bash
# Extract error tracebacks from all cells
jq -r '.cells[].outputs[]? | select(.output_type == "error") | .traceback[]' notebook.ipynb
```

## Debugging Workflow

1. **Execute notebook with outputs captured:**
   ```bash
   # Export marimo notebook to ipynb format with all outputs
   marimo export ipynb nb.py -o __marimo__/nb.ipynb --include-outputs
   ```

2. **Run quick failure check:**
   ```bash
   # Check if execution produced tracebacks
   jq -r '.cells[].outputs[]?.text[]?' __marimo__/nb.ipynb | grep -q "Traceback" && echo "FAILED"
   ```

3. **Inspect notebook using Read tool:**
   ```bash
   # Read the full notebook to identify failing cells and their errors
   Read __marimo__/nb.ipynb
   ```

4. **Fix source code and re-run to verify**
