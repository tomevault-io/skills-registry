# Readwise Reader Prune

Two-pass stale document removal with safe defaults.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## IRON LAW: Dry Run First

**NEVER pass `--delete` without showing the user the dry-run output first.**

1. Run without `--delete` (dry run)
2. Show the user the candidate list and category breakdown
3. Get explicit confirmation
4. THEN run with `--delete`

</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## How It Works

**Pass 1:** Fetch all documents updated in the last N months (the "safe set" -- these have recent activity and are never pruned).

**Pass 2:** Fetch all documents matching filters. Remove from candidates any document that:
- Is in the safe set (recently active)
- Has highlights (num_highlights > 0)
- Has an excluded tag

## Commands

```bash
# Dry run (always do this first)
readwise-custom prune
readwise-custom prune --months 6
readwise-custom prune --category rss --location new
readwise-custom prune --exclude-tag "keep" --exclude-tag "reference"

# Limit candidates shown
readwise-custom prune --months 3 --limit 20

# JSON output (for review)
readwise-custom prune --months 6 --json

# Actually delete (after reviewing dry run)
readwise-custom prune --months 3 --delete
readwise-custom prune --category rss --months 1 --delete
```

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--months <n>` | 3 | Documents inactive for this many months are candidates |
| `--location <loc>` | all | Filter: new, later, shortlist, archive, feed |
| `--category <cat>` | all | Filter: article, email, rss, pdf, epub, tweet, video |
| `--exclude-tag <tag>` | none | Skip documents with this tag (repeatable) |
| `--limit <n>` | all | Cap number of candidates |
| `--delete` | false | Actually delete (default is dry run) |
| `--json` | false | Output as JSON |

## Recommended Workflows

### Weekly RSS cleanup
```bash
readwise-custom prune --category rss --months 1 --location new
# Review, then:
readwise-custom prune --category rss --months 1 --location new --delete
```

### Quarterly deep clean
```bash
readwise-custom prune --months 6 --exclude-tag "reference"
# Review, then:
readwise-custom prune --months 6 --exclude-tag "reference" --delete
```
