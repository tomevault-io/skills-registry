# WRDS Data Access

WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services) provides academic research data via PostgreSQL at `wrds-pgdata.wharton.upenn.edu:9737`.

## Query Enforcement

### IRON LAW: NO QUERY WITHOUT FILTER VALIDATION FIRST

Before executing ANY WRDS query, you MUST:
1. **IDENTIFY** what filters are required for this dataset
2. **VALIDATE** the query includes those filters
3. **VERIFY** parameterized queries (never string formatting)
4. **EXECUTE** the query
5. **INSPECT** a sample of results before claiming success

This is not negotiable. Skipping sample inspection is NOT HELPFUL — the user builds analysis on data with undetected quality problems.

### Rationalization Table - STOP If You Think:

| Excuse | Reality | Do Instead |
|--------|---------|------------|
| "I'll add filters later" | You'll forget and pull bad data | Add filters NOW, before execution |
| "User didn't specify filters" | Standard filters are ALWAYS required | Apply Critical Filters section defaults |
| "Just a quick test query" | Test queries with bad filters teach bad patterns | Use production filters even for tests |
| "I'll let the user filter in pandas" | Pulling millions of unnecessary rows wastes time/memory | Filter at database level FIRST |
| "The query worked, so it's correct" | Query success ≠ data quality | INSPECT sample for invalid records |
| "I can use f-strings for simple queries" | SQL injection risk + wrong type handling | ALWAYS use parameterized queries |

### Red Flags - STOP Immediately If You Think:

- "Let me run this query quickly to see what's there" → NO. Check Critical Filters section first.
- "I'll just pull everything and filter later" → NO. Database-level filtering is mandatory.
- "The table name is obvious from the request" → NO. Check Quick Reference section for exact names.
- "I can inspect the data after the user sees it" → NO. Sample inspection BEFORE claiming success.

### Query Validation Checklist

Before EVERY query execution:

**For Compustat queries (comp.funda, comp.fundq):**
- [ ] Includes `indfmt = 'INDL'`
- [ ] Includes `datafmt = 'STD'`
- [ ] Includes `popsrc = 'D'`
- [ ] Includes `consol = 'C'`
- [ ] Uses parameterized queries for variables
- [ ] Date range is explicitly specified

**For CRSP v2 queries (crsp.dsf_v2, crsp.msf_v2):**
- [ ] Post-query filter: `sharetype == 'NS'`
- [ ] Post-query filter: `securitytype == 'EQTY'`
- [ ] Post-query filter: `securitysubtype == 'COM'`
- [ ] Post-query filter: `usincflg == 'Y'`
- [ ] Post-query filter: `issuertype.isin(['ACOR', 'CORP'])`
- [ ] Uses parameterized queries

**For Form 4 queries (tr_insiders.table1):**
- [ ] Transaction type filter specified (acqdisp)
- [ ] Transaction codes specified (trancode)
- [ ] Date range is explicitly specified
- [ ] Uses parameterized queries

**For ALL queries:**
- [ ] Sample inspection with `.head()` or `.sample()` BEFORE claiming success
- [ ] Row count verification (is result size reasonable?)
- [ ] NULL value check on critical columns
- [ ] Date range validation (does min/max match expectations?)

## SAS ETL Enforcement

### IRON LAW: NO SAS CODE WITHOUT PERFORMANCE VALIDATION FIRST

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
Before writing or executing ANY SAS code on WRDS, you MUST validate performance patterns. This is not negotiable.

1. **MERGE STRATEGY** — Is hash or sort-merge appropriate? Justify the choice.
2. **WHERE CLAUSES** — Are all date/string filters index-friendly? No functions on indexed columns.
3. **PARALLELISM** — Can this job run as an SGE array? Year-by-year is always parallelizable.
4. **SQL OPTIMIZATION** — For PROC SQL: pass-through opportunity? Indexed join columns?

Writing SAS code that forces full table scans when indexes exist is NOT HELPFUL — the user's job runs 100x slower than necessary and may timeout.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

### SAS Code Validation Checklist

Before EVERY SAS program execution:

**For merges/joins:**
- [ ] Small lookup + large fact table → hash object (not `PROC SORT` + `DATA` merge)
- [ ] Hash uses `defineKey`/`defineData`/`defineDone` pattern correctly
- [ ] `h.output()` uses double quotes for macro resolution (not single quotes)
- [ ] `call missing()` initializes hash data variables for non-matches
- [ ] Both tables >50M rows → sort-merge is justified (document why)

**For WHERE clauses (CRITICAL):**
- [ ] **NO** `year(date)`, `month(date)`, `datepart(dt)` wrapping indexed columns
- [ ] Date filters use `BETWEEN "01jan&year."d AND "31dec&year."d` range pattern
- [ ] String filters avoid `upcase()`, `substr()` on indexed columns
- [ ] Compound date filters collapsed to single range (not `year() = X AND quarter() = Y`)

**For batch processing:**
- [ ] Multi-year jobs use SGE array (`#$ -t start-end`) not sequential loop
- [ ] Year passed via `-sysparm` (not `-set` or `%sysget`)
- [ ] Per-year log files (not single shared log)
- [ ] Memory allocation appropriate for workload (`#$ -l m_mem_free=4G` minimum)
- [ ] Single-year benchmark run completed before full array submission

**For PROC SQL:**
- [ ] Join columns are not wrapped in functions
- [ ] `calculated` keyword used for computed column references in HAVING
- [ ] Pass-through SQL considered for direct WRDS PostgreSQL queries
- [ ] No redundant subqueries that could be hash lookups

**For macros:**
- [ ] Macro variables terminated with period (`&year.` not `&year`)
- [ ] Double quotes used where macro resolution is needed
- [ ] `options mprint mlogic symbolgen` used during development

### SAS Rationalization Table - STOP If You Think:

| Excuse | Reality | Do Instead |
|--------|---------|------------|
| "Sort-merge is simpler to write" | Hash is 10x faster for lookup joins and requires no sorting | Write the hash — it's 5 extra lines |
| "year(date) is readable" | Readable but prevents index usage — full table scan on millions of rows | Use BETWEEN with date literals |
| "I'll parallelize later" | Later never comes and the job runs 18x slower sequentially | Write the SGE array job NOW |
| "Single quotes work fine in hash" | Single quotes block macro resolution — your output dataset name is wrong | ALWAYS double quotes in h.output() |
| "PROC SQL is easier than hash" | PROC SQL still sorts for joins — hash avoids all sorting | Hash for lookups, SQL only for complex aggregations |
| "The job only takes a few minutes per year" | 18 years × 3 minutes = 54 minutes sequential vs 3 minutes parallel | SGE array for ANY multi-year job |
| "%sysget works for getting the year" | Unreliable in SGE context — may return blank silently | Use -sysparm + &sysparm. |

### SAS Red Flags - STOP Immediately If You're About To:

- Write `where year(date) = ` anything → STOP. Use `BETWEEN` with date literals.
- Write `proc sort; data; merge` for a lookup join → STOP. Use hash object.
- Write a `%do year = start %to end` loop → STOP. Use SGE array job.
- Use single quotes in `h.output(dataset: '...')` → STOP. Use double quotes.
- Submit a full array job without testing one year first → STOP. Benchmark first.
- Use `-set` or `%sysget` for SGE task parameters → STOP. Use `-sysparm`.

### SAS Reference

See **`references/sas-etl.md`** for complete patterns:
- Hash object merge (basic, multidata, accumulator)
- Index-friendly WHERE clause quick reference table
- SGE array job templates with memory and logging
- PROC SQL pass-through and optimization
- Macro quoting and debugging

## Connection

Initialize PostgreSQL connection to WRDS:

```python
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host='wrds-pgdata.wharton.upenn.edu',
    port=9737,
    database='wrds',
    sslmode='require'
    # Credentials from ~/.pgpass
)
```

Configure authentication via `~/.pgpass` with `chmod 600`:
```
wrds-pgdata.wharton.upenn.edu:9737:wrds:USERNAME:PASSWORD
```

Connect via SSH tunnel:
```bash
ssh wrds
```

This uses `~/.ssh/wrds_rsa` for authentication.

## Critical Filters

### Compustat Standard Filters
Always include for clean fundamental data:
```sql
WHERE indfmt = 'INDL'
  AND datafmt = 'STD'
  AND popsrc = 'D'
  AND consol = 'C'
```

### CRSP v2 Common Stock Filter
Equivalent to legacy `shrcd IN (10, 11)`:
```python
df = df.loc[
    (df.sharetype == 'NS') &
    (df.securitytype == 'EQTY') &
    (df.securitysubtype == 'COM') &
    (df.usincflg == 'Y') &
    (df.issuertype.isin(['ACOR', 'CORP']))
]
```

### Form 4 Transaction Types
```sql
WHERE acqdisp = 'D'  -- Dispositions
  AND trancode IN ('S', 'D', 'G', 'F')  -- Sales, Dispositions, Gifts, Tax
```

## Parameterized Queries

Always use parameterized queries (never string formatting):

Use scalar parameter binding for single values:
```python
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT gvkey, conm FROM comp.company WHERE gvkey = %s
""", (gvkey,))
```

Use ANY() for list parameters:
```python
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT * FROM comp.funda WHERE gvkey = ANY(%s)
""", (gvkey_list,))
```

## Date Awareness

When querying historical data, leverage current date context for dynamic range calculations.

Current date is automatically available via `datetime.now()`. Apply this to:
- Data range validation (e.g., "get data for last 5 years")
- Fiscal year calculations
- Event study windows

Implement dynamic date ranges in queries:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Query last 5 years of data
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=5*365)

query = """
SELECT * FROM comp.funda
WHERE datadate BETWEEN %s AND %s
"""
df = pd.read_sql(query, conn, params=(start_date, end_date))
```

Always incorporate current date awareness in date-dependent queries to ensure results remain fresh across time.
