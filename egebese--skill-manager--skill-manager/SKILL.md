# Skill Manager

Analyze the current project's tech stack and disable irrelevant globally-installed skills by injecting a bounded section into the project's CLAUDE.md.

## When to Use

- User says "manage skills", "optimize skills", "skill manager"
- User says "disable irrelevant skills" or "which skills do I need?"
- User says "clean up skills for this project"
- User says "re-enable all skills"
- At the start of a new project to reduce context window waste

## Quick Start

Run the Python analysis script if available, otherwise follow the manual workflow below.

## Step 1: Detect Project Tech Stack

Check for these files in the project root (current working directory):

| File | Stack Signal |
|------|-------------|
| `package.json` | Node.js — read for framework (next, react, vue, angular, svelte, etc.) |
| `Podfile` or `*.xcodeproj` | iOS/macOS native |
| `Package.swift` | Swift Package (iOS/macOS) |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust |
| `go.mod` | Go |
| `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` | Python |
| `Gemfile` | Ruby |
| `composer.json` | PHP |
| `build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts` | Android/JVM |
| `pubspec.yaml` | Flutter/Dart |
| `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml` | Containerized |
| `vercel.json` / `netlify.toml` | Jamstack deployment |
| `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript |
| `.swift` files in root/Sources | Swift CLI/Server |

Read `package.json` dependencies to identify frameworks:
- `next` -> Next.js
- `react` -> React
- `vue` -> Vue
- `@angular/core` -> Angular
- `svelte` -> Svelte
- `stripe` -> Payment processing
- `express` / `fastify` / `hono` -> Node server
- `tailwindcss` -> Tailwind CSS
- `remotion` -> Video/media processing

**Monorepo detection**: If the project has `packages/`, `apps/`, or a workspace config in package.json, scan subdirectories too and union all detected stacks.

**Empty project**: If no recognizable files are found, warn the user and keep all skills active.

## Step 2: Read Installed Skills

Read `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json` to get the list of all globally installed skills. For each skill, note:
- `name` (the key)
- `source` (GitHub repo)
- `skillPath` (where the SKILL.md lives)

## Step 3: Score Each Skill

Assign each skill to a tier based on the detected tech stack.

### Tier Definitions

| Tier | Score Range | Meaning |
|------|------------|---------|
| **essential** | 80-100 | Directly relevant to detected stack |
| **useful** | 40-79 | Cross-platform utility, may be used |
| **irrelevant** | 0-39 | Wrong platform/domain entirely |
| **universal** | N/A | Never disabled regardless of stack |

### Universal Skills (NEVER disable these)

```
find-skills, skill-creator, writing-skills, brainstorming,
writing-plans, test-driven-development, dispatching-parallel-agents,
subagent-driven-development, using-superpowers, agentation, skill-manager
```

### Domain Mapping

**iOS/macOS Native Skills** — essential when Swift/Xcode detected:
- `mobile-ios-design` (iOS UI/SwiftUI)
- `asc-xcode-build` (Xcode build/archive)
- `asc-metadata-sync` (App Store metadata)
- `asc-localize-metadata` (App Store localization)
- `asc-subscription-localization` (IAP localization)
- `asc-ppp-pricing` (territory pricing)
- `asc-shots-pipeline` (screenshot automation)
- `asc-notarization` (macOS notarization)
- `app-store-optimization` (ASO)
- `aso-full-audit`, `aso-optimize`, `aso-competitor`, `aso-prelaunch`, `aso`

**Web/SaaS Marketing Skills** — essential when web framework detected:
- `page-cro`, `signup-flow-cro`, `onboarding-cro`, `popup-cro`, `form-cro`
- `copywriting`, `copy-editing`, `content-strategy`
- `seo-audit`, `programmatic-seo`, `schema-markup`
- `analytics-tracking`, `ab-test-setup`
- `email-sequence`, `social-content`
- `marketing-ideas`, `marketing-psychology`
- `free-tool-strategy`, `launch-strategy`
- `paid-ads`, `referral-program`
- `pricing-strategy`, `competitor-alternatives`
- `audit-website`

**Payment Skills** — essential when stripe/payment dependency detected:
- `stripe-integration`
- `paywall-upgrade-cro`
- `churn-prevention`

**Media/AI Generation Skills** — essential when media dependencies detected:
- `fal-audio`, `fal-generate`, `fal-image-edit`, `fal-platform`, `fal-upscale`, `fal-workflow`
- `remotion-best-practices`

### Cross-Domain Rules

- **Marketing skills** are scored "useful" (50) in non-web projects — users sometimes do marketing from any project
- **Stripe/payment** skills are "useful" (50) unless stripe is in dependencies, then "essential" (90)
- **ASO skills** are "essential" (95) for iOS, "irrelevant" (10) for non-mobile
- **fal-* skills** are "irrelevant" (10) unless media processing detected
- **asc-* skills** are "irrelevant" (5) for non-Apple projects
- **remotion-best-practices** is "essential" (90) if remotion is in dependencies, "irrelevant" (10) otherwise

## Step 4: Check for Overrides

If `.claude/skill-manager.json` already exists, read the `overrides` section:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "forceEnable": ["seo-audit"],
    "forceDisable": ["fal-audio"]
  }
}
```

- `forceEnable`: Move these skills to "essential" tier regardless of scoring
- `forceDisable`: Move these skills to "irrelevant" tier regardless of scoring

## Step 5: Generate `.claude/skill-manager.json`

Create the `.claude/` directory if it doesn't exist. Write the analysis file:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "generatedAt": "2026-02-23T12:00:00Z",
  "detectedStack": {
    "primary": "Next.js",
    "languages": ["TypeScript", "JavaScript"],
    "frameworks": ["Next.js", "React", "Tailwind CSS"],
    "platforms": ["Web"],
    "signals": {
      "package.json": true,
      "tsconfig.json": true,
      "next.config.ts": true
    }
  },
  "skills": {
    "page-cro": { "tier": "essential", "score": 95, "reason": "Web CRO directly applicable" },
    "mobile-ios-design": { "tier": "irrelevant", "score": 5, "reason": "No iOS stack detected" }
  },
  "disabled": ["mobile-ios-design", "asc-xcode-build"],
  "enabled": ["page-cro", "stripe-integration"],
  "universal": ["find-skills", "brainstorming"],
  "overrides": {
    "forceEnable": [],
    "forceDisable": []
  },
  "stats": {
    "total": 53,
    "essential": 20,
    "useful": 10,
    "irrelevant": 12,
    "universal": 11
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Update CLAUDE.md

### If "re-enable all" was requested:
1. Remove the `<!-- SKILL-MANAGER:START -->` ... `<!-- SKILL-MANAGER:END -->` block from CLAUDE.md
2. Delete `.claude/skill-manager.json`
3. Confirm to user: "All skills re-enabled."
4. Stop here.

### Normal flow:

Build the injection block:

```markdown
<!-- SKILL-MANAGER:START -->
## Disabled Skills

The following skills are **not relevant** to this project and should be **ignored** (do not invoke them):

- `mobile-ios-design` — No iOS stack detected
- `asc-xcode-build` — No Xcode project detected
- ...

**Stack**: Next.js / TypeScript / React / Tailwind CSS
**Last analyzed**: 2026-02-23
**Re-run**: Say "manage skills" or "/skill-manager" to re-analyze
**Re-enable all**: Say "re-enable all skills" to remove this section
<!-- SKILL-MANAGER:END -->
```

### Injection rules:

1. **Read** the current CLAUDE.md (or note it doesn't exist)
2. **If markers exist**: Replace everything between `<!-- SKILL-MANAGER:START -->` and `<!-- SKILL-MANAGER:END -->` (inclusive) with the new block
3. **If no markers**: Append the block to the end of CLAUDE.md with a blank line separator
4. **If no CLAUDE.md**: Create it with only the skill-manager block

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT modify any other content in CLAUDE.md. Only touch the bounded marker section.

## Step 7: Suggest New Skills (Optional)

If the detected stack suggests skills that aren't installed, mention them:

> Based on your Next.js project, you might also want:
> - `npx skills find nextjs` for Next.js-specific skills
> - `npx skills find react` for React patterns

Only suggest if there's a clear gap. Don't overwhelm with suggestions.

## Step 8: Report Summary

Print a summary table:

```
Skill Manager Analysis Complete

Stack: Next.js / TypeScript / React
Total skills: 53
  Essential: 20 (kept active)
  Useful: 10 (kept active)
  Irrelevant: 12 (disabled in CLAUDE.md)
  Universal: 11 (always active)

Disabled skills written to CLAUDE.md
Full analysis: .claude/skill-manager.json
```

## Automated Mode (Python Script)

If Python 3.9+ is available, you can run the analysis script for faster, deterministic results:

```bash
python3 skills/skill-manager/scripts/analyze_project.py --analyze "$(pwd)"
```

Or just detect the stack:

```bash
python3 skills/skill-manager/scripts/analyze_project.py --detect-stack "$(pwd)"
```

The script path is relative to where the skill is installed. Find it via:
```bash
# The skill is installed at ~/.agents/skills/skill-manager/
python3 ~/.agents/skills/skill-manager/scripts/analyze_project.py --analyze "$(pwd)"
```

The script outputs JSON to stdout. Use the output to populate `.claude/skill-manager.json` and the CLAUDE.md injection block.

If Python is not available, follow the manual steps above — they produce the same result.

## Idempotency

- Running this skill multiple times is safe
- The CLAUDE.md section is replaced, never duplicated
- The JSON file is overwritten with fresh analysis
- User overrides in the JSON are preserved across re-runs

## Edge Cases

- **Monorepo**: Union all detected stacks from subdirectories. More skills stay enabled.
- **Empty project**: Keep all skills active. Warn user: "No stack detected."
- **New skills installed since last run**: Automatically picked up on re-run.
- **Skill uninstalled**: Removed from disabled list on re-run.
- **CLAUDE.md has other content**: Only the marker-bounded section is touched.
