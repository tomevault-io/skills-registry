# Kept Vault

You have access to the user's Kept vault — a local folder of markdown files capturing AI conversations from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

## Tools Available

- `list_vault` — Browse vault structure
- `list_directory` — Browse a specific folder
- `read_file` — Read a conversation or note
- `write_file` — Create a new file (fails if exists)
- `update_file` — Overwrite an existing file (fails if missing)
- `delete_file` — Remove a file
- `move_file` — Move or rename a file
- `grep_vault` — Regex search across all markdown files

## Workflow Rules

1. **Search before creating.** Always `grep_vault` or `list_vault` to check if content already exists before writing new files.
2. **Confirm destructive operations.** Before `delete_file` or `move_file`, tell the user what you're about to do and get confirmation.
3. **Cite sources.** When referencing content from vault files, cite by conversation title and file path.
4. **Respect structure.** Vault uses `provider/conversation-title.md` layout (e.g., `claude/my-chat.md`, `chatgpt/session.md`). Follow this when creating files.
5. **Use grep for content questions.** "Did we discuss X?" → `grep_vault`. "What's in this file?" → `read_file`. "What files exist?" → `list_vault`.
