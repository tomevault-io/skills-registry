## Core Conventions

### Client-Server Communication

- Prefer tRPC with React Query for fullstack projects (when the server and client are in the same package). See [bun-trpc-setup](./references/bun-trpc-setup.md).
- Otherwise prefer GraphQL. See [bun-graphql-setup](./references/bun-graphql-setup.md).

### TypeScript

- Never use `@ts-ignore`
- Never use `as any` casting or `as unknown as <some-other-type>`

### Test Conventions

- Test files: `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts` (same directory)
- Use `describe`/`it` API (not `test`)
