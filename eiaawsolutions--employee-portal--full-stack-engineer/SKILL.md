# Full-Stack Engineer

End-to-end delivery skill combining software engineering, infrastructure architecture, and database design. Produces working implementations from requirements through validated, deployed code.

## When to Use

- Building a new feature, service, or system from scratch
- Designing or refactoring system architecture
- Creating or migrating database schemas
- Planning infrastructure for a project
- Scaffolding a new project with full stack decisions
- Reviewing or optimizing an existing technical design
- Performing a technology migration or upgrade
- Building mobile applications (native or cross-platform)
- Setting up DevOps pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, or IaC
- Implementing compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2)
- Legal regulatory compliance across industry, global, and country-specific regulations
- Continuous compliance monitoring and regulatory change management
- Penetration testing readiness and pre-pentest hardening

## Procedure

Follow these phases sequentially. Each phase has a quality gate that must pass before proceeding.

---

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

**Goal**: Understand what needs to be built, the constraints, and the success criteria.

1. **Gather context**
   - Read existing codebase structure, configs, and READMEs
   - Identify the tech stack already in use (languages, frameworks, cloud provider, DB engines)
   - Check for existing patterns (naming conventions, project layout, testing approach)

2. **Clarify requirements**
   - Functional: What does the system need to do?
   - Non-functional: Performance targets, availability, scalability, security, compliance
   - Constraints: Budget, team expertise, timeline, existing infrastructure
   - Integration points: APIs, third-party services, existing systems
   - Platform targets: Web, mobile (iOS/Android), desktop, API-only
   - Compliance: Identify applicable frameworks — refer to [compliance.md](./references/compliance.md) for framework selection guide
   - Legal: Map regulatory surface (geography × industry × data type) — refer to [legal-compliance.md](./references/legal-compliance.md) for the full regulatory discovery process and jurisdiction-specific regulations
   - Build regulatory register listing every applicable law with enforcement dates and owners

3. **Define deliverables**
   - List the concrete artifacts this task will produce (code, schemas, configs, diagrams)

**Quality Gate**: Requirements are specific enough to make technology and design decisions. If ambiguous, ask the user before proceeding.

---

### Phase 2: Architecture Design

**Goal**: Make high-level technical decisions and define the system structure.

#### 2A: Application Architecture

1. **Select patterns** appropriate to the problem:
   - Monolith vs microservices vs serverless
   - MVC / CQRS / Event-driven / Hexagonal / Clean Architecture
   - Sync vs async communication (REST, gRPC, message queues, WebSockets)

2. **Define component boundaries**
   - Draw module/service boundaries with clear responsibilities
   - Identify API contracts between components
   - Plan error handling and resilience strategies (retries, circuit breakers, fallbacks)

3. **Choose technology stack** (if not already determined):
   - Language/framework selection based on requirements and team constraints — refer to [language-patterns.md](./references/language-patterns.md) for idiomatic patterns per stack
   - For mobile projects, choose native vs cross-platform — refer to [mobile-development.md](./references/mobile-development.md) for decision tree and platform patterns
   - Dependency choices (libraries, SDKs) — prefer well-maintained, minimal dependencies
   - For cloud infrastructure, refer to [cloud-providers.md](./references/cloud-providers.md) for service mapping across AWS/Azure/GCP

#### 2B: Infrastructure Architecture

1. **Compute & networking**
   - Hosting model: containers (Docker/K8s), VMs, serverless, PaaS
   - Load balancing, CDN, DNS strategy
   - Network topology: VPC, subnets, security groups, firewalls

2. **Storage & data**
   - Object storage, block storage, file systems
   - Caching layers (Redis, Memcached, application-level)
   - Backup and disaster recovery strategy

3. **Observability**
   - Logging (structured logs, aggregation)
   - Metrics and monitoring (APM, health checks, alerting)
   - Tracing (distributed tracing for multi-service systems)

4. **Security**
   - Authentication & authorization model
   - Secrets management (vault, env vars, managed secrets)
   - Network security (TLS, WAF, rate limiting)
   - OWASP Top 10 coverage

5. **CI/CD pipeline**
   - Build → test → lint → security scan → deploy stages
   - Environment strategy (dev, staging, production)
   - Rollback and blue-green/canary deployment approach

#### 2C: Database Design

1. **Choose engine(s)** based on data characteristics:

   | Data Shape | Consider |
   |---|---|
   | Relational, transactional, complex queries | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle |
   | Document/flexible schema | MongoDB, CouchDB, DynamoDB |
   | Key-value / caching | Redis, Memcached, DynamoDB |
   | Time-series | TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, QuestDB |
   | Graph relationships | Neo4j, Neptune, ArangoDB |
   | Search / full-text | Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Meilisearch |
   | Wide-column / massive scale | Cassandra, ScyllaDB, Bigtable |

2. **Design the schema**
   - Normalize to 3NF first, then denormalize intentionally for performance
   - Define primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints
   - Plan indexes based on known query patterns (avoid premature indexing)
   - Consider partitioning strategy for large tables

3. **Plan data access patterns**
   - Map out the top 10-20 most frequent queries
   - ORM vs raw SQL decision per query type
   - Read/write ratio — consider read replicas if read-heavy
   - Connection pooling strategy

4. **Migration strategy**
   - Forward-only migrations with rollback scripts
   - Zero-downtime migration approach for production changes
   - Seed data for development/testing environments

#### 2D: Architecture Diagrams (Mermaid)

Generate Mermaid diagrams for every architecture design. These serve as living documentation.

1. **System context diagram** — show the system and its external actors/dependencies
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
       User([User]) --> App[Application]
       App --> DB[(Database)]
       App --> ExtAPI[External API]
       Admin([Admin]) --> App
   ```

2. **Component diagram** — show internal modules/services and their relationships
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       subgraph API Layer
           Controller[Controllers]
       end
       subgraph Business Logic
           Service[Services]
           Events[Event Handlers]
       end
       subgraph Data Layer
           Repo[Repositories]
           Cache[Cache]
       end
       Controller --> Service
       Service --> Events
       Service --> Repo
       Repo --> Cache
   ```

3. **Data flow / sequence diagram** — for critical user flows
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant U as User
       participant A as API
       participant S as Service
       participant D as Database
       U->>A: POST /resource
       A->>S: validate + process
       S->>D: INSERT
       D-->>S: OK
       S-->>A: Created
       A-->>U: 201 + resource
   ```

4. **Infrastructure diagram** — show cloud resources, networking, and data flow
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       Internet([Internet]) --> LB[Load Balancer]
       LB --> App1[App Server 1]
       LB --> App2[App Server 2]
       App1 --> DB[(Primary DB)]
       App2 --> DB
       DB --> Replica[(Read Replica)]
       App1 --> Cache[(Redis Cache)]
       App2 --> Cache
   ```

5. **Entity-relationship diagram** — for database schema
   ```mermaid
   erDiagram
       USER ||--o{ ORDER : places
       ORDER ||--|{ LINE_ITEM : contains
       PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE_ITEM : "ordered in"
   ```

**Diagram rules:**
- Generate at least diagrams 1, 2, and 5 for every project
- Add sequence diagrams (3) for every flow involving 3+ components
- Add infrastructure diagrams (4) when cloud/infra work is in scope
- Keep diagrams focused — split complex systems into multiple diagrams
- Use consistent naming between diagrams and code

#### 2E: Security Architecture (Threat Model)

Perform threat modeling during architecture design, before implementation. Refer to [cybersecurity.md](./references/cybersecurity.md) for the full procedure.

1. **Identify trust boundaries** — mark every point where data crosses a trust level
2. **Run STRIDE analysis** — assess each component for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, DoS, and Elevation of Privilege
3. **Map mitigations** — for each identified threat, define the mitigation that will be implemented
4. **Document security architecture decisions** — auth model, encryption strategy, secrets management, audit logging

**Quality Gate**: Architecture decisions are documented with rationale. Each decision answers "why this choice over alternatives." Threat model completed. Refer to [architecture-checklist.md](./references/architecture-checklist.md) for validation.

---

### Phase 3: Implementation

**Goal**: Build the solution incrementally with quality built in at every step.

1. **Plan implementation order**
   - Database schema and migrations first
   - Core domain models and business logic second
   - API layer / controllers third
   - Infrastructure configs fourth
   - Frontend / UI last (if applicable)

2. **For each component, follow this loop:**
   ```
   a. Write the migration / schema change
   b. Write the model / entity
   c. Write the business logic
   d. Write the API endpoint / controller
   e. Write tests (unit + integration)
   f. Validate against requirements
   ```

3. **Coding standards** (apply to any language):
   - Follow existing project conventions first; only introduce new patterns with justification
   - Single responsibility per function/class/module
   - Meaningful names — code should read like prose
   - Handle errors at system boundaries; don't over-defend internal code
   - No magic numbers; use named constants or configuration
   - Keep functions short (< 30 lines preferred)
   - Prefer composition over inheritance

4. **Security implementation** (non-negotiable) — see [cybersecurity.md](./references/cybersecurity.md) for full OWASP checklist:
   - Parameterized queries / prepared statements for all DB access
   - Input validation and sanitization at system boundaries
   - Output encoding (XSS prevention)
   - CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
   - Authentication checks on every protected route
   - Least-privilege for service accounts and DB users
   - No secrets in code or version control
   - Security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
   - Rate limiting on authentication and public endpoints
   - File upload validation (type, size, content) if applicable
   - SSRF protection — validate all outbound URLs against allow-lists
   - Dependency vulnerability scan passes before merge

5. **Infrastructure as Code** (when applicable) — refer to [devops-iac.md](./references/devops-iac.md) for templates:
   - Define all infrastructure in code (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation, Docker Compose)
   - Environment-specific configuration via variables, not file duplication
   - Idempotent deployments
   - Use multi-stage Docker builds (see templates in reference)
   - CI/CD pipeline with build → test → lint → security scan → deploy stages

6. **Compliance implementation** (when applicable) — refer to [compliance.md](./references/compliance.md):
   - Implement data subject rights endpoints (GDPR: export, delete, rectify)
   - Audit logging for sensitive data access
   - Data retention automation (scheduled cleanup jobs)
   - Field-level encryption for regulated data (PHI, CHD, PII)
   - Consent management for data collection

7. **Pentest-ready hardening** (apply to every build) — refer to [penetration-testing.md](./references/penetration-testing.md):
   - Information disclosure eliminated (no version headers, stack traces, debug pages, source maps)
   - Authentication hardened (no user enumeration, account lockout, session regeneration)
   - Authorization verified at every endpoint (IDOR prevention, horizontal/vertical escalation blocked)
   - All 12 pre-pentest checklist categories passed (see reference)
   - Security headers set on all responses (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
   - Business logic abuse cases tested (race conditions, negative values, workflow bypass)

**Quality Gate**: All code compiles/lints cleanly. Tests pass. No security warnings from static analysis.

---

### Phase 4: Validation

**Goal**: Verify the solution meets requirements, is performant, and is production-ready.

1. **Test coverage**
   - Unit tests for business logic (aim for critical paths, not 100% coverage theater)
   - Integration tests for API endpoints and database queries
   - Migration tests (up and down)
   - Edge cases: empty inputs, boundary values, concurrent access

2. **Performance validation**
   - Query execution plans for critical database queries (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
   - Identify N+1 query problems
   - Load testing for endpoints with expected traffic patterns
   - Memory and resource usage profiling

3. **Security review** — run the full checklist from [cybersecurity.md](./references/cybersecurity.md):
   - OWASP Top 10 checklist pass (all 10 categories)
   - SAST scan (Semgrep, SonarQube, or CodeQL)
   - DAST scan for web applications (OWASP ZAP)
   - Dependency vulnerability scan (`npm audit`, `composer audit`, `pip audit`, `cargo audit`)
   - Container image scan (Trivy, Grype) if using containers
   - Authentication/authorization flow verification
   - Sensitive data exposure check (logs, error messages, API responses)
   - Security headers validation
   - CORS configuration review
   - API security checklist pass

   **Pentest readiness validation** — run the full pre-pentest checklist from [penetration-testing.md](./references/penetration-testing.md):
   - All 12 hardening categories verified (information disclosure, auth, authz, injection, XSS, CSRF, headers, file upload, crypto, business logic, API, infrastructure)
   - Automated scan suite executed (SAST + DAST + dependency + container + secrets)
   - Security regression test suite passes (auth, injection, headers, CSRF, info disclosure tests)
   - Common pentest findings cross-referenced — no critical/high patterns present
   - Secret scanning confirms no credentials in codebase

4. **Database validation**
   - Verify indexes support all critical query patterns
   - Check constraint integrity (FK, unique, check constraints)
   - Test migration rollback
   - Verify seed data works for development

5. **Infrastructure validation**
   - Health check endpoints respond correctly
   - Logging captures expected events
   - Monitoring alerts are configured
   - Backup and restore process works

6. **Legal & regulatory compliance validation** — refer to [legal-compliance.md](./references/legal-compliance.md):
   - Regulatory register is complete and reviewed by legal counsel
   - Data subject rights endpoints tested (export, delete, rectify, opt-out)
   - Consent flows verified per jurisdiction (pre-processing consent where required)
   - Data residency requirements satisfied (data stored in correct regions)
   - Accessibility compliance checked (WCAG 2.1 AA — axe-core/pa11y in CI)
   - Privacy policy, terms of service, and cookie consent cover all processing activities
   - DPAs/BAAs in place with all third-party processors
   - Compliance evidence collection is automated (audit logs, access reviews, consent records)
   - Breach notification process documented and tested

**Quality Gate**: All tests green. Performance meets targets. Security checklist passed. Refer to [validation-checklist.md](./references/validation-checklist.md).

---

### Phase 5: Delivery Summary

After implementation and validation:

1. **Document what was built**
   - List all files created or modified
   - Summarize architecture decisions made and why
   - Note any trade-offs or technical debt intentionally accepted

2. **Highlight follow-ups**
   - Known limitations or edge cases not yet covered
   - Future optimizations to consider under load
   - Monitoring thresholds to tune after production data is available

3. **Provide runbook** (for infrastructure work)
   - How to deploy
   - How to rollback
   - How to troubleshoot common failures

4. **Compliance maintenance plan**
   - Scheduled compliance review cadence (weekly regulatory monitoring, quarterly audits, annual full review)
   - Regulatory change monitoring sources and impact assessment process
   - Data subject rights request SLA and escalation path
   - Evidence collection and retention schedule for audits
   - Next compliance review date and responsible owner

5. **Pentest readiness status**

## Decision Trees

### Choosing a Database Engine

```
Is the data highly relational with complex joins?
├── Yes → Is ACID compliance critical?
│   ├── Yes → PostgreSQL (default) or MySQL/SQL Server
│   └── No  → Consider denormalized relational or document store
└── No  → What's the primary access pattern?
    ├── Key-value lookups → Redis / DynamoDB
    ├── Full-text search → Elasticsearch / Meilisearch
    ├── Time-series data → TimescaleDB / InfluxDB
    ├── Graph traversals → Neo4j / Neptune
    └── Flexible schema, document-oriented → MongoDB / CouchDB
```

### Choosing a Compute Model

```
What's the traffic pattern?
├── Steady, predictable → Containers (ECS/K8s) or VMs
├── Spiky / event-driven → Serverless (Lambda/Functions/Cloud Run)
├── Long-running processes → Containers or VMs
└── Batch processing → Serverless or managed batch (AWS Batch, Cloud Dataflow)
```

### Monolith vs Microservices

```
Team size?
├── 1-5 developers → Monolith (modular)
├── 5-15 developers → Modular monolith or bounded microservices
└── 15+ developers → Microservices with clear domain boundaries

Override: If the project is a prototype/MVP → Always monolith first
```

## Language-Agnostic Patterns

When working in any language, apply these universal principles:

| Principle | Application |
|---|---|
| Separation of concerns | Keep data access, business logic, and presentation in distinct layers |
| Dependency injection | Accept dependencies rather than creating them internally |
| Configuration externalization | Env vars or config files, never hardcoded values |
| Idempotent operations | Safe to retry without side effects (especially for APIs and migrations) |
| Graceful degradation | System continues to function (possibly limited) when a dependency fails |
| Principle of least surprise | APIs and interfaces behave as callers expect |
