# Documentation Template Builder

Generate professional project documentation in ai-companions style: status symbols, quick reference tables, cross-referenced structure, and complete content (not just empty scaffolding).

**Rich examples available.** Load any of these via `read_file` when you need a detailed reference:
- `{skill_dir}/references/readme-example.md`
- `{skill_dir}/references/roadmap-example.md`
- `{skill_dir}/references/spec-example.md`
- `{skill_dir}/references/deployment-example.md`
- `{skill_dir}/references/adr-example.md`
- `{skill_dir}/references/operational-example.md`
- `{skill_dir}/references/prd-example.md`
- `{skill_dir}/references/persona-example.md`
- `{skill_dir}/references/release-notes-example.md`
- `{skill_dir}/references/strategy-example.md`
- `{skill_dir}/references/competitive-analysis-example.md`
- `{skill_dir}/references/gtm-plan-example.md`

## Nova-Agent File Naming Conventions

All docs live in `docs/`. Use the correct type prefix and sequence number:

| Type | Pattern | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Feature/usage guide | `GUIDE-NNN-NAME.md` | How-to docs, developer references |
| Product requirements | `PRD-NNN-NAME.md` | Feature requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria |
| User personas | `PERSONA-NNN-NAME.md` | Who we're building for — goals, frustrations, behaviors |
| Specification | `SPEC-NNN-NAME.md` | Feature design, data models, APIs |
| Architecture decision | `ADR-NNN-NAME.md` | Design decisions and rationale |
| Deployment/runbook | `RUN-NNN-NAME.md` | Step-by-step operational procedures |
| Release notes | `RELEASE-NNN-NAME.md` | Customer-facing changelog for a version |
| Product strategy | `STRATEGY-NNN-NAME.md` | Vision, bets, OKRs, long-term direction |
| Competitive analysis | `RESEARCH-NNN-NAME.md` | Market landscape, competitor teardowns, positioning |
| Go-to-market plan | `GTM-NNN-NAME.md` | Launch coordination across PM, Marketing, CS |
| Status/project report | `REPORT-NNN-NAME.md` | Point-in-time project status |

**Getting the number:** Check `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` for the highest number in use per type. Use the next in sequence.

**NAME format:** All-caps with underscores. Example: `GUIDE-009-SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md`

**Exceptions:** `README.md` (repo root), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CLAUDE.md` stay at the root without prefixes.

---

## Core Documentation Principles

### Structure & Hierarchy
- Header hierarchy: `# Title` → `## Section` → `### Subsection`
- Start every doc with metadata in the first 3–5 lines after the title: **Status**, **Last Updated**, **Type**
- Include a "Quick Reference" or "Quick Start" section near the top
- Group related content in tables for scannability

### Status Symbols
Use consistently throughout all docs:
- `✅` — Complete, active, production-ready
- `🔴` — Blocked, critical issue, deprecated
- `🟡` — In progress, partial, needs review
- `📋` — Planned, roadmap item, pending
- `✏️` — Draft, being written
- `⚠️` — Warning, deprecated but still used
- `🔗` — Reference link, related doc

### Cross-referencing
- Every doc must end with a `## Related Documentation` table
- Use descriptive link text: `[SPEC-015 Agentic Workflow](path)` not `[here](path)`
- Format: `| [DOC-NNN Title](path) | One-line description |`

## Best Practices

### Every Doc Must Include
- `**Status:**` and `**Last Updated:**` in the first 5 lines after the title
- `**Type:**` specifying the doc category (GUIDE, SPEC, ADR, RUN, REPORT)
- At least one quick-reference table or quick-steps section
- `## Related Documentation` table at the bottom with 2–5 cross-references

### Tables
- Max 5 columns; sort by importance, not alphabetically
- Use status symbols instead of long text (✅ beats "complete and working")

### Code Blocks
- Always specify language: ` ```bash `, ` ```python `, ` ```sql `
- Include expected output as comments where helpful

### Links
- Always descriptive: `[SPEC-015 Agentic Workflow](path)` not `[link](path)`
- Cross-reference format: `| [DOC-NNN Title](path) | One-line description |`
