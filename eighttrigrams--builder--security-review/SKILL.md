description: Security review guidance. Use when reviewing code for security vulnerabilities, assessing authentication/authorization, or evaluating data handling. Use when this capability is needed.

Report ONLY when you found something concerning and then report what you found.
If you didn't find anything, don't report it. Mention only things you actually found.
Don't "check off" certain points here by saying "passed" this or that point. 
I assume when you didn't mention an aspect that is precisely because it PASSED.
(But, if there is really absolutely nothing you found, at least acknowledge with a single statement that you did found nothing.)

# Security Review

- Data leaks? Can outsiders see user data? Can users accidentally see each others' data?

## Focus Areas

- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization checks
- SQL injection and parameterized queries
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
- Sensitive data exposure
- Security misconfigurations
- Dependency vulnerabilities

## Process

1. Identify all entry points (API endpoints, form inputs, URL parameters)
2. Trace data flow from input to storage/output
3. Check for proper validation at trust boundaries
4. Verify authentication/authorization on protected resources
5. Assess error handling (no sensitive info in errors)
6. Review logging practices (no secrets logged)

# Web Application Security

## Backend (Clojure/Ring)

- Ensure all database queries use parameterized statements
- Verify middleware stack includes security headers
- Check that sessions are properly secured (httpOnly, secure flags)
- Validate that file uploads are restricted and sanitized
- Confirm rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

## Frontend (ClojureScript/Re-frame)

- Sanitize any user content before rendering
- Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or equivalent
- Ensure sensitive data is not stored in localStorage
- Verify API calls include proper authentication tokens
- Check for exposed secrets in client-side code

## Data Handling

- Passwords must be hashed (bcrypt, argon2)
- PII should be encrypted at rest when possible
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Proper cleanup of temporary data
