# Architecture Review

Report ONLY when you found something concerning and then report what you found.
If you didn't find anything, don't report it. Mention only things you actually found problematic.
Don't "check off" certain points here by saying "passed" this or that point. 
I assume when you didn't mention an aspect that is precisely because it PASSED.
(But, if there is really absolutely nothing you found, at least acknowledge with a single statement that you did found nothing.)

## Focus areas

### Module responsibilities

Does each namespace or function has a clear responsibility? And is it one, and a clearly nameable one?
Or are there multiple things being done at once? In that case, why not break it down into modules which do just **one** thing?

### Side effects to the outside, functional core

Example, when we access an environment variable in a namespace, we can ask if we can access the variable one namespace \"higher\",
at the current function's call-site, and pass it simply in as a paramter. The more functions are kept pure, the easier it is for us to test.

### Full Stack Application Review - Keep the frontend small and focused on UI

When we have an application like here which is part single page application (SPA) for the frontend and a backend (via REST, or GraphQL),
we want to consider some things.

While the frontend is responsible for keeping a specific user's state, it should stay **as dumb as possible**. For example, instead of sorting
something in the frontend, we always would chose sorting on the backend and hand over a list (which is sorted by definition) to the frontend.
