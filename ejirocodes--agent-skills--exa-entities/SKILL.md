# Exa Entity Search

## Quick Reference

| Topic | When to Use | Reference |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Company Search** | Finding companies, competitive research | [company-search.md](references/company-search.md) |
| **People Search** | Finding profiles, recruiting | [people-search.md](references/people-search.md) |
| **Websets** | Data collection at scale, monitoring | [websets.md](references/websets.md) |

## Essential Patterns

### Company Search

```python
from exa_py import Exa

exa = Exa()

results = exa.search_and_contents(
    "AI startups in healthcare series A funding",
    category="company",
    num_results=20,
    text=True
)

for company in results.results:
    print(f"{company.title}: {company.url}")
```

### People Search

```python
results = exa.search_and_contents(
    "machine learning engineers San Francisco",
    category="linkedin_profile",
    num_results=20,
    text=True
)

for profile in results.results:
    print(f"{profile.title}: {profile.url}")
```

### Websets for Lead Generation

```python
# Create a webset for company collection
webset = exa.websets.create(
    name="AI Healthcare Companies",
    search_query="AI healthcare startups",
    category="company",
    max_results=100
)

# Monitor for new matches
exa.websets.add_monitor(
    webset_id=webset.id,
    schedule="daily"
)
```

## Category Reference

| Category | Use Case | Index Size |
|----------|----------|------------|
| `company` | Company websites, about pages | Millions |
| `linkedin_profile` | Professional profiles | 1B+ profiles |
| `personal_site` | Individual blogs, portfolios | Millions |
| `github` | Repositories, developer profiles | Millions |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not using category filter** - Always set `category="company"` or `category="linkedin_profile"` for entity search
2. **Expecting structured data** - Exa returns web pages; parse text for structured fields
3. **Over-broad queries** - Add location, industry, or role specifics for better results
4. **Ignoring rate limits** - Batch requests and implement backoff for large-scale collection
5. **Missing domain filters** - Use `include_domains=["linkedin.com"]` for profile-only results
