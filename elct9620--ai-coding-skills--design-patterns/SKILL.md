name: design-patterns
description: Select and apply GoF design patterns: Factory, Builder, Strategy, Observer, Adapter, Decorator. Use when solving recurring design problems or structuring multi-component changes. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user needs to decouple components, wrap legacy APIs, handle multiple algorithm variants, build complex objects step by step, or asks which pattern fits their situation. Use when this capability is needed.

## Related Skills

- Modeling business concepts (Entity, Value Object)? → Use **domain-modeling** instead
- Restructuring existing code toward a pattern? → Use **refactoring** for safe migration steps
- Deciding if a pattern is even needed (YAGNI)? → Use **principles** to evaluate first

## Applicability Rubric

| Condition | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| Multi-component change | Feature affects multiple components | Single component change |
| Recognizable problem | Matches known design problem | Unique/novel problem |
| Flexibility needed | Requires extensible solution | Fixed requirements |
| Recurring challenge | Solving common design issue | One-off implementation |

**Apply when**: Any condition passes

## Core Principles

### Pattern Selection Process

```
1. Identify the problem
   ↓
2. Match problem to pattern category
   ↓
3. Evaluate pattern candidates
   ↓
4. Consider trade-offs
   ↓
5. Apply pattern minimally
```

### Pattern Categories

| Category | Purpose | Common Patterns |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Creational | Object creation | Factory, Builder, Singleton |
| Structural | Object composition | Adapter, Decorator, Facade |
| Behavioral | Object interaction | Strategy, Observer, Command |

## Pattern Quick Reference

| Category | Pattern | Use When | Example |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| Creational | Factory Method | Object creation varies by context | `createLogger(type)` |
| Creational | Builder | Complex object with many optional parts | Fluent configuration |
| Creational | Singleton | Single instance needed globally | Configuration manager |
| Structural | Adapter | Interface incompatibility | Wrap legacy API |
| Structural | Decorator | Add behavior dynamically | Logging wrapper |
| Structural | Facade | Simplify complex subsystem | Unified API client |
| Structural | Composite | Tree structures | UI components |
| Behavioral | Strategy | Algorithm varies at runtime | Payment methods |
| Behavioral | Observer | One-to-many notifications | Event system |
| Behavioral | Command | Encapsulate operations | Undo/redo actions |
| Behavioral | State | Behavior changes with state | Order status |

## Completion Rubric

### Before Applying

| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| Problem identification | Problem clearly defined | Vague problem statement |
| Real need | Solves actual problem | Hypothetical/speculative |
| Simpler alternatives | Considered simpler options first | Jumped to pattern |
| Team familiarity | Team understands pattern | Pattern is obscure |

### During Implementation

| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| Minimal application | Pattern applied minimally | Over-applied |
| Clear naming | Names reflect pattern intent | Generic/unclear names |
| Intent preservation | Pattern intent maintained | Pattern misused |
| Appropriate complexity | Complexity justified | Over-engineered |

### After Implementation

| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| Flexibility gained | Code more flexible | Same or less flexible |
| Documented | Pattern documented if not obvious | Undocumented complexity |
| Tested | Tests cover pattern behavior | Pattern untested |

## Anti-Pattern Warning

**Pattern Fever**: Applying patterns everywhere

Signs:
- Patterns for trivial problems
- Multiple patterns where one suffices
- Code harder to understand than before

Cure: YAGNI - Use patterns only when they solve real problems
