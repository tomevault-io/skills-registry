# X Data Signals

Deep dive into the X recommendation engine's core signal libraries: SimClusters (Community Embeddings), RealGraph (Interaction Probabilities), TweepCred (Reputation), and TwHIN (Knowledge Graph).

## Context

The engine relies on four primary signal pillars:
1.  **SimClusters (v2):** A Matrix Factorization framework that anchors users and tweets into ~145k community vectors. It is the primary driver for "Embedding-Based Candidate Generation" (EBCG).
2.  **RealGraph:** A weighted, directed graph of user interactions, predicting the probability `P(u -> v)` of engagement. It powers the "In-Network" feed.
3.  **TweepCred:** A continuous PageRank score (0-100) determining user authority.
4.  **TwHIN:** (Twitter Heterogeneous Information Network) Dense knowledge-graph embeddings that capture multi-modal relationships (Users, Tweets, Ads, Topics) in a shared vector space.

For detailed logic, see:
- [SimClusters (Communities)](./references/simclusters.md)
- [RealGraph (Interaction Graph)](./references/realgraph.md)
- [TweepCred (Reputation)](./references/tweepcred.md)

## What it does

* **Identifies "Lookalike" Audiences:** Uses SimClusters to find content popular in communities you *implicitly* belong to, even if you don't follow the authors.
* **Quantifies Relationship Strength:** Uses RealGraph to assign a floating-point weight to every user-user connection, prioritizing close friends over acquaintances.
* **Filters Low-Quality Nodes:** Uses TweepCred to prune candidate pools during the retrieval stage, saving compute by ignoring low-authority accounts.
* **Calculates Embedding Similarity:** Computes dot-product scores between User embeddings and Tweet embeddings to predict relevance in the "Earlybird" (Light Ranker) stage.

## Guidelines

* **SimClusters v2 Implementation:** The source code distinguishes between **"Known-For"** (what a Creator talks about) and **"Interested-In"** (what a Consumer likes). A tweet is recommended if the Creator's "Known-For" vector aligns with the Consumer's "Interested-In" vector.
* **GraphJet vs. RealGraph:**
    * **RealGraph:** The offline/batch-calculated interaction model (the "map").
    * **GraphJet:** The real-time, in-memory graph processing engine that *serves* the RealGraph data to the HomeMixer.
* **TwHIN vs. SimClusters:**
    * **SimClusters** is *sparse* and interpretable (e.g., "Cluster 123 = JavaScript").
    * **TwHIN** is *dense* and uninterpretable (64-dim float vectors). TwHIN is often used for "TwHIN-Collab" filtering in the candidate generation phase.
* **Signal Decay:** RealGraph weights decay over time. A "Like" from 2018 is worth significantly less than a "Like" from today. The `UserInteractionSignal` service handles this time-decay logic.
* **Code Locations:**
    * `src/scala/com/twitter/simclusters_v2`: Core logic for community embeddings.
    * `src/scala/com/twitter/graph/batch/job/twhin`: Knowledge graph embedding generation.
    * `src/java/com/twitter/search/earlybird`: Where real-time signals meet search indices.

## Example Trigger Prompts

* "/explain-graph SimClusters @user"
* "/explain-graph RealGraph interactions"
