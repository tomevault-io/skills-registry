# X Ranking Engine

Deep technical knowledge of the X Heavy Ranker, including MaskNet/Phoenix architectures, Multi-Task Learning (MTL) heads, probability calibration, and the mathematical WeightedScorer logic.

## Context

The **Heavy Ranker** is the final scoring stage of the pipeline. It reduces a pool of ~1,500 candidates to a sorted list based on predicted user engagement. The system has evolved from Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) to deep neural networks like **MaskNet** and more recently, transformer-based architectures (Phoenix) that leverage learned embeddings rather than hand-engineered features.

For detailed technical specifications, see:
- [Model Architecture](./references/model-architecture.md)
- [Scoring Parameters & Weights](./references/scoring-parameters.md)

## What it does

* **Details Multi-Task Learning (MTL):** Explains how the model simultaneously predicts multiple engagement types (Like, Reply, Retweet, Video View, etc.) using a shared backbone.
* **Decodes Feature Hydration:** Maps how `HomeMixer` gathers User (SimClusters, TwHIN) and Tweet (Content, Engagement counts) features to pass to the `Navi` service.
* **Analyzes Calibration:** Explains the process of transforming raw model outputs into "calibrated" probabilities that reflect real-world interaction rates.
* **Explains Point-wise Ranking:** Details why the algorithm scores candidates in isolation (Candidate Isolation) to allow for massive horizontal scaling.

## Guidelines

* **Architecture Isolation:** When modifying the ranker, remember that the model cannot "see" other tweets in the same batch. Diversity and deduplication must happen in the `Selector` or `Mixer` stages, not the `Scorer`.
* **Weighting vs. Probability:** The model predicts *probabilities* (e.g., "What is the 0-1 chance this user likes this tweet?"). The `WeightedScorer` then applies *weights* to these probabilities to get the final score.
* **Negative Signals are Nuclear:** Signals like "Report" or "Show Less Often" have weights (e.g., -369.0) that are orders of magnitude larger than positive signals, ensuring toxic content is effectively removed from the candidate pool.
* **Recency Decay:** The engine applies a time-decay function ($e^{-\lambda t}$) to the final score to ensure the timeline remains fresh and doesn't get stuck on high-scoring old content.
* **Navi Interop:** The Heavy Ranker is hosted in the **Navi** (Rust) service. Features must be serialized into Thrift objects in Scala and sent via RPC.

## Example Trigger Prompts

* "/audit-ml show weights: Like vs Retweet"
* "/audit-ml explain MaskNet handling for this feature"
* "Relationship between P(Like) and final ranking score"
* "Impact of adding 'Long-form Read' head to MTL model"
* "How are probabilities calibrated for new low-data tweets?"
* "Where are Heavy Ranker features defined in Thrift?"
