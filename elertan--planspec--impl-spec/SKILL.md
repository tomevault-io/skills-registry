# Implementation Spec Writer

Transform validated design specs into actionable, phased implementation plans.

## Usage

```
planspec:impl-spec planspec/designs/[topic].md
```

## Input Requirements

The design spec must contain (as produced by `planspec:brainstorm`):
- Problem statement
- Success criteria (must have, quality attributes, anti-goals)
- Approach with alternatives considered
- Design (architecture, data model, interfaces, behavior, testing requirements)
- Risks and mitigations
- Dependencies

## Output

Creates `planspec/implementations/[topic].md` with:
- Phased task breakdown
- Review checkpoints
- Security review gates (where applicable)

The spec is reviewed against code reviewer criteria before finalization to catch issues that would be flagged during implementation.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Validate Input

1. Read the design spec file
2. Verify all required sections exist:
   - Problem
   - Success Criteria
   - Approach
   - Design (with sub-sections)
   - Risks
   - Dependencies

3. If sections missing, abort with specific feedback:
   ```
   "Cannot generate implementation spec. Design spec missing:
   - [missing section 1]
   - [missing section 2]

   Run planspec:brainstorm to complete the design spec first."
   ```

### Step 2: Analyze Codebase

1. Read existing codebase structure:
   - File organization patterns
   - Naming conventions
   - Existing similar implementations (for consistency)
   - Test file locations and patterns

2. Map design components to concrete file paths:
   - Where should new files go?
   - What existing files need modification?
   - Where do tests live?

3. Identify project conventions:
   - Import style
   - Error handling patterns
   - Logging patterns
   - Test framework and patterns

### Step 3: Determine Review Requirements

From the design spec, extract:

1. **Security review needed if** design spec mentions:
   - Authentication/authorization
   - User input handling
   - Database queries
   - API keys/secrets
   - File system access
   - External service calls with credentials
   - Any item in Risks related to security

2. **Mark phases for security review** based on which tasks touch these areas

### Step 4: Generate Task Breakdown

#### Task Granularity Rules

Each task should be:
- **Atomic:** One logical unit of work
- **Verifiable:** Clear acceptance criteria
- **Contextual:** Includes why, not just what
- **Bounded:** Completable in one focused session

#### Task Structure

```markdown
### Task [Phase].[Number]: [Action verb] [what]

**Context:** [Why this task exists - link to design decision]

**Files:**
- Create: `path/to/new/file.ts`
- Modify: `path/to/existing/file.ts` - [what changes]

**Requirements:**
- [Specific requirement from design spec]
- [Another requirement]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Verifiable condition - can be checked]
- [ ] [Another verifiable condition]

**Dependencies:** None | Task X.Y, Task X.Z
```

#### Phase Structure

Group tasks into logical phases:

```markdown
## Phase 1: [Foundation/Core/Setup]

[Tasks that must come first - shared infrastructure, types, utilities]

### Task 1.1: ...
### Task 1.2: ...

---

## Phase 2: [Core Implementation]

[Main feature implementation]

### Task 2.1: ...
### Task 2.2: ...
### Task 2.3: Write tests for Phase 2

**Tests should cover:**
- [Critical path from design spec]
- [Edge cases from design spec's Behavior section]
- [Error cases from design spec]

### CHECKPOINT

Gate: Tests pass, issues resolved before Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3: [Integration/Security-Sensitive]

### Task 3.1: ...
### Task 3.2: Write tests for Phase 3

### CHECKPOINT

Security: Auth flow, user input handling, database queries

Gate: Tests pass, issues resolved before completion.
```

### Step 5: Map Design to Tasks

| Design Section | Maps To |
|----------------|---------|
| Architecture Overview | Phase 1 tasks (setup, structure) |
| Data Model | Early tasks (types, schemas, migrations) |
| Interfaces | API/contract tasks |
| Behavior - Happy Path | Core implementation tasks |
| Behavior - Edge Cases | Test requirements |
| Behavior - Error Handling | Implementation + test tasks |
| Testing Requirements | Test tasks per phase |
| Risks - Security | Security review checkpoints |
| Dependencies - Blocking | Task dependencies, Phase 1 setup |

### Step 6: Write Implementation Spec

Create file at `planspec/implementations/[topic].md`:

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
design-spec: ../designs/[topic].md
status: ready
executor: planspec:impl-spec-executor
---

# Implementation: [Title]

> **Execute with:** `planspec:impl-spec-executor planspec/implementations/[topic].md`

## Overview

[1-2 sentence summary of what we're implementing]

**Design spec:** [link to design spec]
**Security reviews:** Phases X, Y (or "None")

## Prerequisites

- [ ] [Dependency from design spec]
- [ ] [Another dependency]

## Phase 1: [Name]

### Task 1.1: [Title]
...

---

## Phase 2: [Name]

### Task 2.1: [Title]
...

### Task 2.N: Tests for Phase 2

**Test file:** `path/to/tests/feature.test.ts`

**Cover:**
- [ ] [Happy path scenario]
- [ ] [Edge case 1]
- [ ] [Edge case 2]
- [ ] [Error case 1]

### CHECKPOINT

Gate: Tests pass, issues resolved before Phase 3.

---

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] All review checkpoints passed
- [ ] Design spec success criteria met:
  - [ ] [Criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Criterion 2]
```

### Step 7: Review Loop

Before finalizing, review the spec to catch issues that would be flagged during code review.

1. **Spawn spec reviewer subagent:**

   Read `./spec-reviewer-prompt.md`, substitute variables:
   - `{IMPL_SPEC_PATH}` - path to the implementation spec just written
   - `{DESIGN_SPEC_PATH}` - path to the design spec
   - `{CODE_REVIEWER_PATH}` - `../impl-spec-executor/code-reviewer-prompt.md`
   - `{IMPL_SPEC_FILENAME}` - filename of the implementation spec

   ```
   Task(
     subagent_type: "general-purpose",
     description: "Review impl-spec before finalization",
     prompt: [constructed from template]
   )
   ```

2. **Handle review result:**

   ```
   IF verdict == "PASS":
     proceed to Step 8

   IF verdict == "PASS WITH FIXES" or "FAIL":
     # Patch the impl-spec based on findings
     For each blocking/should-fix issue:
       - Update the specific task description
       - Add missing tasks if needed
       - Clarify vague requirements

     # Re-run review
     Go back to step 7.1
   ```

3. **Patch strategy:**

   - Edit specific tasks rather than regenerating entire spec
   - For "Task X.Y needs error handling specified" → add error handling to that task's requirements
   - For "Missing task for edge case X" → add new task to appropriate phase
   - For "O(n²) approach described" → update task to specify efficient approach

4. **Loop limit:**

   - Maximum 3 iterations
   - If still failing after 3, output spec with remaining issues noted
   - User can decide to proceed or manually refine

### Step 8: Output Summary

After review passes:

```
Implementation spec created: planspec/implementations/[topic].md

Review: PASSED (N iterations)

Summary:
- Phases: [N]
- Tasks: [M]
- Checkpoints: [X]
- Security reviews: Phases [list] (or "None")

Prerequisites to verify:
- [Any blocking dependencies]

Ready to execute with: planspec:impl-spec-executor planspec/implementations/[topic].md
```

---

## Principles

- **Traceability:** Every task links back to design decisions
- **No gaps:** Design spec coverage should be 100%
- **No invention:** Don't add tasks not justified by design spec
- **Concrete paths:** Use real file paths from codebase analysis
- **Meaningful tests:** Only where they verify correctness, not for coverage theater
- **Review gates:** Prevent forward progress with broken/insecure code
- **Shift left:** Catch code review issues at spec stage, not during implementation
