# Pull Request Creation SOP

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-11
**Status**: Active

---

## Overview

### Purpose
This SOP guides developers through creating pull requests that follow project conventions. It covers all PR types (feature, bug fix, hotfix, release) with proper documentation, branch flows, and templates.

### When to Use
**ALWAYS**: Creating any PR for the project
**SKIP**: Draft PRs, WIP PRs (use GitHub UI directly)

---

## Process Workflow

### Flow Diagram
```
[Identify Type] --> [Analyze Changes] --> [Create Summary] --> [Submit PR]
```

### Phase Summary
| Phase | Objective | Deliverable |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1. Identify Type | Determine PR category | PR type selected |
| 2. Analyze Changes | Review commits and diffs | Change summary |
| 3. Create Summary | Draft title and description | PR documentation |
| 4. Submit PR | Execute `gh pr create` | Active GitHub PR |

---

## Quick Start

1. **Ensure branch is ready**: All changes committed, tests passing
2. **Determine PR type**: Feature, Bug Fix, Hotfix, or Release
3. **Create PR**: Use the appropriate template below
4. **Fill template**: Complete all sections
5. **Request review**: Assign reviewers

See [Process Workflow](#process-workflow) for detailed steps.

## PR Types & Decision Tree

### Decision Tree

```
What are you merging?
  |-- Production release? (development -> main) -> [RELEASE PR]
  |-- Critical production fix? (urgent) -> [HOTFIX PR] (hotfix -> main)
  |-- Bug fix? (non-urgent) -> [BUG FIX PR] (bugfix -> development)
  |-- New functionality? -> [FEATURE PR] (feature -> development)
```

### Quick Reference

| PR Type | From -> To | Urgency | Title Format | Duration |
|---------|------------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Feature** | feature -> development | Normal | `feat: <description>` | 5-10 min |
| **Bug Fix** | bugfix -> development | Normal | `fix: <description>` | 3-7 min |
| **Hotfix** | hotfix -> main | **URGENT** | `hotfix: <description>` | 3-7 min |
| **Release** | development -> main | Scheduled | `Release: <version>` | 15-30 min |

### Branch Naming Convention

- `development` or `develop` - Development branch (target for feature/bugfix PRs)
- `main` or `master` - Production branch (target for hotfix/release PRs)

> Note: Verify your project's branch naming convention before creating PRs.

---

## Phase 1: Analyze Changes

### Step 1.1: Review Commit History

```bash
# Generic format
git log BASE..HEAD --oneline --no-merges

# Examples by PR type:
git log development..feature/my-feature --oneline --no-merges  # Feature PR
git log development..bugfix/my-fix --oneline --no-merges       # Bug Fix PR
git log main..hotfix/critical-fix --oneline --no-merges        # Hotfix PR
git log main..development --oneline --no-merges                # Release PR

# Get detailed commit messages
git log BASE..HEAD --pretty=format:"%s" --no-merges

# Count commits
git rev-list --count BASE..HEAD
```

### Step 1.2: Analyze Code Differences

```bash
# View diff statistics
git diff BASE...HEAD --stat
git diff BASE...HEAD --shortstat
git diff BASE...HEAD --name-only

# Area-specific diffs (adjust paths to your project structure)
git diff BASE...HEAD --stat -- src/components/
git diff BASE...HEAD --stat -- src/pages/
git diff BASE...HEAD --stat -- src/store/
```

### Step 1.3: Categorize Changes

Group changes by type:
- **Features**: New functionality
- **Fixes**: Bug corrections
- **Refactors**: Code improvements
- **Infrastructure**: Dependencies, config
- **Tests**: Test coverage
- **Documentation**: Docs updates

## Phase 2: Create PR Summary

### Step 2.1: Draft PR Title

**Feature PR**:
```

```

**Hotfix PR**:
```
hotfix: Prevent critical crash on startup
