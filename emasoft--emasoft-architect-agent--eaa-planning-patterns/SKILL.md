# Planning Patterns Skill

## Overview

This skill teaches orchestrators how to create comprehensive planning documents that guide projects from conception to execution. Planning patterns enable you to design system architecture, identify risks, create execution sequences, and break work into actionable tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ for utility scripts
- Understanding of project scope and stakeholder requirements
- Write access to planning output directories
- Familiarity with project management concepts

## Instructions

Use this skill when:
- Starting a new project and need to plan it properly
- Expanding an existing system and need to plan the expansion
- Facing complex stakeholder requirements and need to organize them
- Building something novel with uncertain risks
- Leading a team and need to communicate a clear roadmap
- Running a project that is falling behind and need to replan

**Execute these phases in order:**
1. Architecture Design - Design the structural blueprint
2. Risk Identification - Discover and plan for obstacles
3. Roadmap Creation - Create a sequenced execution plan
4. Implementation Planning - Break roadmap into actionable tasks

## Applying These Patterns

### Scenario 1: Starting a Brand New Project

1. Architecture Design + Risk Identification (parallel)
2. Roadmap Creation
3. Implementation Planning
4. Stakeholder reviews and approvals

### Scenario 2: Expanding Existing System

1. Review existing architecture document
2. Identify what will change (new components, new data flows)
3. Document new risks (expansion risks may differ from original)
4. Create phase for expansion work
5. Plan expansion tasks

### Scenario 3: Replanning a Project in Progress

1. Review what was planned vs what actually happened
2. Update architecture if changes were made
3. Update risk register based on realized risks
4. Adjust roadmap sequence and phases
5. Replan remaining tasks

### Scenario 4: Rapid Planning (Under Pressure)

1. Do architecture quickly (focus on critical components)
2. Do risk identification quickly (focus on critical risks only)
3. Do roadmap quickly (rough sequence, critical path only)
4. Plan immediate next phase in detail
5. Plan remaining phases at higher level (can detail later)

**Important**: Even under pressure, do all four phases. Do them faster, not skip them.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Architecture | Blueprint of how your system is organized: components, responsibilities, communication |
| Risk | Something that could prevent you from reaching your goal |
| Roadmap | Sequenced plan showing what will be built, in what order, with what dependencies |
| Milestone | Significant achievement or completion point marking end of phases |
| Task | Small, focused unit of work that one person can complete |

---

## Error Handling

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Architecture is too complex | Break complex components into smaller sub-components with single responsibility |
| Risks are everywhere | Prioritize by impact x probability. Focus on CRITICAL and IMPORTANT risks |
| Progress stalls | Check buffer capacity. If 100% utilization, add buffer work capacity |
| Team does not understand plan | Create multiple formats: executive summary, visual sequence, milestone checklist |
| Plan became irrelevant | Revisit and update plan as conditions change |
| Task owners overcommitted | Reduce tasks, adjust scope, or add team members |

## Examples

### Example 1: New Project Planning

```
Project: Build user authentication system

Phase 1 - Architecture:
- Components: auth-service, user-store, token-manager
- Data flows: login request → auth-service → user-store → token-manager → JWT
- Dependencies: auth-service depends on user-store

Phase 2 - Risks:
- Risk 1: OAuth provider rate limits (HIGH impact, MEDIUM probability)
- Mitigation: Implement caching, prepare fallback providers

Phase 3 - Roadmap:
- Milestone 1: Basic login (Week 1-2)
- Milestone 2: OAuth integration (Week 3-4)
- Milestone 3: Token refresh (Week 5)

Phase 4 - Tasks:
- Task 1.1: Create user schema (Owner: Dev A, 2 days)
- Task 1.2: Implement password hashing (Owner: Dev B, 1 day)
```

### Example 2: Rapid Planning Under Pressure

```
1. Quick architecture: Focus on 3 critical components only
2. Quick risks: Identify top 5 blocking risks
3. Quick roadmap: Define critical path only
4. Detailed next phase: Plan immediate tasks
5. Rough remaining phases: Detail later as needed
```

| Risk Identification | Discover obstacles | Risk register |
| Roadmap Creation | Create execution sequence | Roadmap with phases |
| Implementation Planning | Create task list | Task assignments |

**Key Principles**:
- Every step must be specific and concrete
- All four phases are required - do not skip phases
- Plans change as you execute - revisit and update regularly

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Plan not progressing | Dependencies unclear or blocking | Review dependency graph with `tldr arch`, identify critical path blockers, escalate to stakeholders |
| Roadmap phases out of order | Incorrect dependency sequencing | Use `dependency_resolver.py` to validate dependency order, rebuild phase sequence |
| Stakeholders reject plan | Misaligned expectations or missing requirements | Review `requirement-immutability.md`, verify Requirement Compliance Table, schedule stakeholder alignment meeting |
| Tasks too large to estimate | Insufficient decomposition | Apply task splitting: no task >3 days. Break into sub-tasks with clear acceptance criteria |
| Risk mitigation strategies failing | Risk assessment inaccurate | Update risk register with actual realized risks, adjust impact/probability scores, revise mitigation strategies |
| Team not following plan | Plan unclear or inaccessible | Create multiple formats (executive summary, visual roadmap, daily checklist), ensure plan visibility |
| Plan validation script failing | Quality thresholds not met | Run `validate_plan.py` with `--verbose`, address specific violations in order of priority |
| Architecture becomes obsolete | System evolved differently than planned | Schedule architecture review, update component diagram, revise affected phases |

---

## Next Steps

1. Read `references/step-by-step-procedures.md` for process overview
2. Choose the activity most relevant to your current situation
3. Read the detailed reference for that activity
4. Use the templates and checklists provided
5. If using scripts, run them to generate working documents
6. Apply the planning pattern to your project
7. Have stakeholders review and approve the outputs

---

**Final Note**: Perfect planning is impossible. Good planning is achievable. The goal is to think through the major decisions before executing, so that execution is smooth and changes are managed, not chaotic.
