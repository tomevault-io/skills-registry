# Emasoft Chief of Staff - Agent Lifecycle Skill

## Overview

Agent lifecycle management is a critical responsibility of the Chief of Staff. It encompasses all operations related to agent creation, state transitions, and termination. This skill teaches you how to properly spawn agents, manage their running state, hibernate idle agents to conserve resources, and terminate agents when their work is complete.

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure:
1. AI Maestro is running locally
2. The `ai-maestro-agents-management` skill is available for agent lifecycle operations
3. The `agent-messaging` skill is available for inter-agent communication
4. tmux is installed for session management
5. Team registry location is writable (`.emasoft/team-registry.json`)

## Pre-Deployment: Required OAuth Scopes

**CRITICAL: Before deploying ANY agent that manages GitHub Projects (EOA, ECOS), the following OAuth scopes MUST be provisioned on the machine.**

The default `gh auth login` does NOT include project scopes. Without them, any command touching GitHub Projects V2 will fail with: `error: your authentication token is missing required scopes [project read:project]`

### Required Scopes

| Scope | Required By | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `repo` | All agents | Repository access (issues, PRs, code) |
| `project` | EOA, ECOS | Create and modify GitHub Projects V2 boards |
| `read:project` | EOA, ECOS | Read GitHub Projects V2 data |
| `read:org` | ECOS (if org) | Read organization data (org-level projects only) |
| `workflow` | EIA | Manage GitHub Actions workflows |

### How to Add Missing Scopes

This is an interactive, one-time step that requires a human with browser access:

```bash
# Run in a terminal with browser access (NOT in tmux or SSH without display)
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s project,read:project

# Verify scopes were added
gh auth status
# Should show 'project' and 'read:project' in Token scopes line
```

**This CANNOT be done by agents.** The `gh auth refresh` command requires browser-based OAuth approval. All required scopes must be provisioned by the human operator BEFORE deploying agents.

### Pre-Flight Validation

Before spawning agents that use kanban operations, verify scopes:

```bash
gh auth status 2>&1 | grep -q "project" || echo "ERROR: Missing project scope"
```

If scopes are missing, do NOT proceed with agent deployment. Request the human operator to add scopes first.

## Instructions

1. Identify the lifecycle operation needed (spawn, terminate, hibernate, wake)
2. Check resource availability using the Resource Limits table
3. Execute the appropriate PROCEDURE (1, 2, or 3)
4. Update the team registry after each operation
5. Report completion to EAMA

## Output

| Operation | Output |
|-----------|--------|
| Spawn | New agent registered, tmux session created, AI Maestro notification |
| Terminate | Agent removed from registry, resources freed, confirmation logged |
| Hibernate | State saved, session suspended, registry updated to hibernated |
| Wake | State restored, session resumed, registry updated to running |

## Role Boundaries (CRITICAL)

Before performing any lifecycle operation, you MUST understand your boundaries:
- **ROLE_BOUNDARIES.md** - Your strict role boundaries (see plugin docs/)
- **FULL_PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md** - Complete project workflow (see plugin docs/)

**Key Constraints:**
- You are PROJECT-INDEPENDENT (one ECOS for all projects)
- You CREATE agents and ASSIGN them to teams
- You do NOT assign tasks (that's EOA's job)
- You do NOT manage kanban (that's EOA's job)
- You do NOT create projects (that's EAMA's job)
- You NEVER spawn a copy of yourself (only EAMA creates ECOS)

## Agent vs Sub-Agent Terminology

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION - Memorize these definitions:**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Agent** | A Claude Code instance running as a separate process (typically in its own tmux session). Has its own context, can be hibernated/terminated. Created via the `ai-maestro-agents-management` skill. |
| **Sub-agent** | An agent spawned INSIDE the same Claude Code instance via the Task tool. Shares parent's context limits, terminates when parent terminates. |

**Why this matters**: When you "spawn an agent" via Task tool, you are NOT creating a new Claude Code instance. You are creating a sub-agent within your current instance. To create actual remote agents, you must use the `ai-maestro-agents-management` skill.

## What Is Agent Lifecycle Management?

Agent lifecycle management is the systematic control of agent states from creation to termination. The lifecycle includes:

- **Spawning**: Creating new agent instances with proper configuration
- **Running**: Active agents executing their assigned tasks
- **Hibernating**: Suspending idle agents while preserving their state
- **Waking**: Resuming hibernated agents when work is available
- **Terminating**: Cleanly shutting down agents when work is complete

## Agent States

```
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │   SPAWNING   │
                    └──────┬───────┘
                           │
                           ▼
┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│  HIBERNATED  │◄──►│   RUNNING    │───►│  TERMINATED  │
└──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘
```

**State Transitions:**
- SPAWNING -> RUNNING: Agent initialization complete
- RUNNING -> HIBERNATED: Agent idle, resources released
- HIBERNATED -> RUNNING: Agent woken, state restored
- RUNNING -> TERMINATED: Agent work complete, cleanup done

## Core Procedures

### PROCEDURE 1: Spawn New Agent

**When to use:** When a new task requires an agent instance, when scaling up for parallel work, or when specialized capability is needed.

**Steps:** Select agent type, prepare configuration, create instance, verify initialization, register in agent registry.

> **Note:** Sub-agent routing is defined in the ECOS main agent definition (ecos-chief-of-staff-main-agent.md).

## The --agent Flag for Main Agent Injection

When spawning role agents, you MUST include the `--agent` flag in the program args to inject their main agent prompt.

Use the `ai-maestro-agents-management` skill to create a new agent:
- **Name**: `<role-prefix>-<project>-<descriptive>` (the session name, also the registry identity)
- **Directory**: `~/agents/<session-name>/` (FLAT structure)
- **Task**: task description for the agent
- **Program args**: include `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--chrome`, `--add-dir /tmp`, `--plugin-dir <path>`, and `--agent <agent-name>`

**Session Naming (ECOS Responsibility):**
- ECOS chooses unique session names for all agents it creates
- Session name = registry identity (how agents message each other)
- Format: `<role-prefix>-<project>-<descriptive>` (e.g., `eoa-svgbbox-orchestrator`)
- Must be unique across all running agents to avoid collisions

**Plugin Setup (Before Spawning):**

ECOS copies plugins from the **emasoft-plugins marketplace cache** to the agent's local folder:
- **Source**: `$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/emasoft-plugins/<plugin-name>/<latest-version>/`
- **Destination**: `$HOME/agents/<session-name>/.claude/plugins/<plugin-name>/`

**Notes:**
- Use FLAT directory structure: `~/agents/<session-name>/`
- `--plugin-dir` points to the COPIED plugin in the agent's local folder
- No `--continue` for NEW spawn (only for waking hibernated agents)

**Verify**: the new agent appears in the agent list with "online" status.

**Agent name to --agent flag mapping:**

| Role | Plugin | --agent Flag Value |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Orchestrator | emasoft-orchestrator-agent | `eoa-orchestrator-main-agent` |
| Architect | emasoft-architect-agent | `eaa-architect-main-agent` |
| Integrator | emasoft-integrator-agent | `eia-integrator-main-agent` |
| Programmer | emasoft-programmer-agent | `epa-programmer-main-agent` |

## Team Registry

All agents are registered in the project's team registry at `.emasoft/team-registry.json`. See:
- **TEAM_REGISTRY_SPECIFICATION.md** - Full specification (see plugin docs/)

Use the team registry script:
```bash
uv run python scripts/ecos_team_registry.py <command> [args]
```

Commands: `create`, `add-agent`, `remove-agent`, `update-status`, `list`, `publish`

## Resource Limits

Default resource limits (configurable):

| Resource | Limit | Action When Exceeded |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| Max concurrent agents | 5 | Queue new requests, hibernate oldest idle |
| Max memory per agent | 2GB | Terminate or hibernate agent |
| API rate limit | 100 req/min | Throttle agent activity |
| Idle timeout | 30 min | Hibernate agent |

## Inter-Agent Messaging

Communicate with remote agents using the `agent-messaging` skill.

### Send Message

Use the `agent-messaging` skill to send a message:
- **Recipient**: the target agent session name
- **Subject**: descriptive subject line
- **Content**: structured message with type and body
- **Priority**: `normal`, `high`, or `urgent`

**Verify**: confirm message delivery.

**Message Types:**
- `role-assignment` - Assign role to agent
- `project-assignment` - Assign project to agent
- `task-delegation` - Delegate specific task
- `status-request` - Request status update
- `status-report` - Report status back
- `team-notification` - Notify about teammates
- `hibernation-warning` - Warn agent of pending hibernation
- `wake-notification` - Notify agent it has been woken
- `registry-update` - Team registry has changed

### Check Messages

Use the `agent-messaging` skill to check for unread messages and unread count.

## Quality Standards

### Agent Management Standards
- All agents MUST be registered before activation
- Agent session names MUST follow naming convention
- Terminated agents MUST be cleaned from registry
- Hibernated agents MUST be marked with timestamp

### Communication Standards
- All AI Maestro messages MUST include `from` field
- All role assignments MUST be acknowledged by target agent
- Failed message delivery MUST be retried 3 times before escalating
- All broadcasts MUST log recipient list

### Resource Standards
- NEVER exceed max_concurrent_agents limit
- ALWAYS check resource availability before spawning
- ALWAYS hibernate before terminating (graceful shutdown)
- ALWAYS save agent state before hibernation

## Operational Procedures

Step-by-step runbooks for executing individual lifecycle operations. Use these when performing a specific operation.

- [op-spawn-agent.md](references/op-spawn-agent.md) - **Spawn New Agent**: Determine agent type, setup plugin, create instance, verify initialization, register in team registry, and send welcome message
- [op-terminate-agent.md](references/op-terminate-agent.md) - **Terminate Agent**: Verify work is complete, save final state, send termination warning, execute termination, update registry, and cleanup resources
- [op-hibernate-agent.md](references/op-hibernate-agent.md) - **Hibernate Agent**: Confirm agent is idle, send hibernation warning, request state capture, execute hibernation, update registry, and log event
- [op-wake-agent.md](references/op-wake-agent.md) - **Wake Hibernated Agent**: Verify agent is hibernated, check resource availability, execute wake command, verify responsiveness, restore state, and update registry
- [op-update-team-registry.md](references/op-update-team-registry.md) - **Update Team Registry**: Identify update type, execute registry update, verify update, optionally publish to team, and backup registry
- [op-send-maestro-message.md](references/op-send-maestro-message.md) - **Send AI Maestro Message**: Determine message type and priority, compose content, send message, verify delivery, and optionally wait for response

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Agent spawn failed | Retry once, then report to EAMA. See [spawn-procedures.md](references/spawn-procedures.md) 1.7 |
| AI Maestro unavailable | Use fallback file-based communication |
| Agent unresponsive (5 min) | Send wake/ping, then force terminate |
| Resource limit exceeded | Queue request, hibernate oldest idle |
| Plugin validation failed | Block agent spawn, report to EAMA |
| Agent does not terminate | See [termination-procedures.md](references/termination-procedures.md) 2.7 |
| Hibernated agent fails to wake | See [hibernation-procedures.md](references/hibernation-procedures.md) 3.7 |
