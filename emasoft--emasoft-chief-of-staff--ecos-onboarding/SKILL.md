# Emasoft Chief of Staff Onboarding Skill

## Overview

Agent onboarding is the process of integrating new AI agents into a coordinated team. The Chief of Staff ensures that each new agent understands their role, the project context, key procedures, and how to communicate with teammates. Proper onboarding reduces confusion, prevents errors, and accelerates time-to-productivity.

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure:
1. Agent to be onboarded is created and running
2. Project documentation is available
3. Team registry is accessible

## Instructions

1. Identify what needs onboarding (agent or project)
2. Gather required context and documentation
3. Send onboarding materials to target
4. Verify understanding and readiness

## Output

| Onboarding Type | Output |
|-----------------|--------|
| New agent | Agent understands role and context |
| New project | Project registered, team assigned |
| Role change | Agent updated with new responsibilities |

## What Is Agent Onboarding?

Agent onboarding is a structured process to prepare a new agent for effective participation in a multi-agent team. Unlike human onboarding which may take days or weeks, agent onboarding happens in minutes but must be thorough and precise.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Structured**: Follows a defined checklist
- **Role-specific**: Tailored to the agent's assigned role
- **Context-rich**: Provides necessary project knowledge
- **Verifiable**: Confirms understanding before work begins

## Onboarding Components

### 1. Onboarding Checklist
A systematic list of items to cover during onboarding.

### 2. Role Briefing
Detailed explanation of the agent's role, responsibilities, and expectations.

### 3. Project Handoff
Transfer of essential project knowledge, conventions, and current state.

## Core Procedures

```

### Example 3: Project Handoff Summary

```markdown
# Project Handoff: Authentication Module

## Project Overview
We are building a secure authentication module for the main application.
Current sprint: Sprint 5 (2 weeks remaining)

## Current State
- Login endpoint: COMPLETE
- Logout endpoint: IN PROGRESS (60%)
- Password reset: NOT STARTED
- Session management: BLOCKED (waiting on logout)

## Key Files
- src/auth/login.py - Login implementation
- src/auth/logout.py - Logout implementation (your focus)
- tests/auth/ - Test directory

## Conventions
- Use async/await for all I/O operations
- All endpoints return JSON
- Error responses use standard error format
- Tests required for all new functions

## Active Context
The logout endpoint is partially implemented. Current work is at line 145.
Next step: Implement session invalidation.
```

## Error Handling

### Issue: Agent does not respond to onboarding initiation

**Symptoms:** No acknowledgment, onboarding cannot begin.

**Solution:** Verify agent session is active, retry with higher priority, check for messaging issues, escalate to user if persistent.

### Issue: Agent claims not to understand role briefing

**Symptoms:** Agent asks repeated clarification questions, demonstrates confusion.

**Solution:** Provide more specific examples, break down responsibilities into smaller steps, have agent repeat back understanding, consider if role is appropriate match.

### Issue: Project handoff is incomplete

**Symptoms:** Agent lacks critical context, makes errors based on missing information.

**Solution:** Review handoff checklist, identify gaps, send supplementary information, verify understanding of each critical point.

## Handoff Validation Checklist

Before sending any handoff document to a new agent, validate using this checklist:

```markdown
### Handoff Validation Checklist

Before sending handoff:
- [ ] All required fields present (from/to/type/UUID/task)
- [ ] UUID is unique (check existing handoffs: `ls $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/thoughts/shared/handoffs/`)
- [ ] Target agent exists and is alive (use the `ai-maestro-agents-management` skill to list agents and verify the target is online)
- [ ] All referenced files exist (`test -f <path> && echo "EXISTS" || echo "MISSING"`)
- [ ] No placeholder [TBD] markers (`grep -r "\[TBD\]" handoff.md`)
- [ ] Document is valid markdown (no broken links, proper formatting)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clearly defined
- [ ] Current state accurately reflects reality
- [ ] Contact information for questions provided
```

**Validation command:**
```bash
# Validate the plugin (including handoff documents) using the CPV plugin validator
uv run --with pyyaml python scripts/validate_plugin.py . --verbose
```

**Required fields for all handoffs:**

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `from` | Sending agent name | `ecos-chief-of-staff` |
| `to` | Target agent name | `new-developer-agent` |
| `type` | Handoff type | `project-handoff`, `role-briefing`, `emergency-handoff` |
| `UUID` | Unique handoff identifier | `HO-20250204-auth-001` |
| `task` | Task or role being handed off | `Authentication Module Development` |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Onboarding is mandatory** - Never assign work before onboarding is complete
2. **Verification is essential** - Confirm understanding at each step
3. **Role briefing must be specific** - Generic descriptions cause confusion
4. **Project handoff includes state** - Not just structure but current progress
5. **Document completion** - Record that onboarding happened and what was covered
6. **Validate before sending** - Always run handoff validation checklist
