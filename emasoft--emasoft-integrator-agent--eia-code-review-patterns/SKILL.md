# Code Review Patterns Skill

## Overview

This skill teaches the **two-stage code review methodology** for comprehensive PR analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure:
1. Intermediate software development experience
2. Familiarity with code review basics and pull request workflows
3. Access to the repository containing the PR to review
4. Python 3.8+ for running helper scripts

## Output

| Output Type | Format | Contents |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Quick Scan Report | Markdown table | File structure, diff magnitude, obvious issues, initial confidence score (0-100%), Go/No-Go decision |
| Deep Dive Report | Markdown table | 8-dimension analysis with individual scores, final confidence score (0-100%), approval/rejection decision, actionable feedback |
| Final Review Document | Markdown | Complete review with both stages, confidence calculations, decision rationale, merge/rejection status |

## Instructions

1. **Receive PR review request** from EOA or user via AI Maestro
2. **Perform Gate 0 compliance check** - Verify requirements using [references/requirement-compliance.md](references/requirement-compliance.md)
3. **Execute Stage 1: Quick Scan** - Surface-level assessment using [references/stage-one-quick-scan.md](references/stage-one-quick-scan.md)
   - Assess file structure and diff magnitude
   - Identify obvious issues and red flags
   - Calculate initial confidence score
   - Make Go/No-Go decision (proceed if ≥70% confidence)
4. **Execute Stage 2: Deep Dive** - Full 8-dimension analysis using [references/stage-two-deep-dive.md](references/stage-two-deep-dive.md)
   - Evaluate all 8 dimensions (Functional, Architecture, Quality, Performance, Security, Testing, Compatibility, Documentation)
   - Calculate final confidence score
   - Make approval/rejection decision (approve if ≥80% confidence)
5. **Run quality gates** - Execute tests, verify linting, check documentation
6. **Create final review report** using scripts/review_report_generator.py
7. **Merge or reject PR** based on final decision
8. **Close related issues** if PR is merged
9. **Report completion** to requesting agent via AI Maestro

## Core Methodology: Two-Stage Review Process

The skill is built on a structured two-stage approach:

**Stage One: Quick Scan (Small Scope)**
- Initial surface-level assessment
- Identification of obvious issues
- Scope: File structure + diff magnitude review
- Confidence scoring threshold: 70%+
- Go/No-Go decision point

**Stage Two: Deep Dive (Full Scope)**
- Comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis
- Root cause investigation
- Scope: All 8 dimensions across all changed components
- Confidence scoring threshold: 80%+
- Final approval/rejection decision

## Key Concepts

### Confidence Scoring System

Confidence scoring represents the reviewer's certainty about the quality assessment. Scores range from 0-100%:

- **80-100%**: High confidence - Ready for approval
- **60-79%**: Medium confidence - Requires additional review or clarification
- **Below 60%**: Low confidence - Defer decision, escalate for expert review

The 80% threshold ensures that code reviews maintain quality standards before approval.

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis

Code review examines code across 8 dimensions simultaneously:

1. **Functional Correctness** - Does the code do what it should?
2. **Architecture & Design** - Is the structure sound and maintainable?
3. **Code Quality** - Is the code clean, readable, and well-documented?
4. **Performance** - Does the code perform adequately?
5. **Security** - Are there vulnerabilities or compliance issues?
6. **Testing** - Is there adequate test coverage?
7. **Backward Compatibility** - Does it break existing interfaces?
8. **Documentation** - Is it adequately documented for future maintainers?
