# GitHub Projects Sync

## Overview

The GitHub Projects Sync skill enables the INTEGRATOR-AGENT to manage team tasks through GitHub Projects V2. This is the OFFICIAL task management interface for coordinating work across remote developer agents.

**Critical Distinction**:
- **GitHub Projects** = Team/Project tasks (features, bugs, PRs, issues)
- **Claude Tasks** = Orchestrator personal tasks ONLY (reading docs, planning, reviewing)

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated with `project` scope
- GitHub Projects V2 enabled repository
- GraphQL API access
- Python 3.8+ for automation scripts
- AI Maestro integration for notifications (optional)

## Instructions

Follow these steps when using this skill:

1. **Identify the task type** - Determine if you need to create, update, query, or sync GitHub Projects data
2. **Authenticate** - Verify GitHub CLI is authenticated with `gh auth status` and has `project` scope
3. **Locate the project** - Find the project ID using GraphQL queries (see Quick Start section below)
4. **Select the appropriate operation** - Refer to the Reference Documentation section to find the matching use case
5. **Execute the operation** - Use GraphQL API via `gh api graphql` or run automation scripts
6. **Verify the result** - Check the project board or query the API to confirm the change was applied
7. **Notify stakeholders** - Send AI Maestro messages to relevant agents if coordination is needed
8. **Document the change** - Add comments to issues or update task lists to maintain audit trail

### Checklist

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

- [ ] Identify the task type (create/update/query/sync)
- [ ] Verify GitHub CLI authentication with `project` scope
- [ ] Locate the project using GraphQL queries
- [ ] Select the appropriate operation from reference documentation
- [ ] Execute the operation via GraphQL API or automation scripts
- [ ] Verify the result on the project board or via API query
- [ ] Notify stakeholders via AI Maestro if needed
- [ ] Document the change in issue comments or task lists

**When to invoke this skill:**
- Assigning GitHub issues to remote agents
- Tracking feature implementation progress
- Synchronizing PR status with project boards
- Managing sprint/iteration planning
- Generating project status reports
- Coordinating multi-agent work on features

## Output

| Output Type | Format | Location | Description |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Project item IDs | JSON | API response | GraphQL node IDs for created/updated items |
| Status updates | JSON | API response | Confirmation of field value changes |
| Issue metadata | JSON | API response | Issue numbers, titles, states, assignees |
| Project reports | Markdown | AI Maestro messages | Status summaries, progress updates |
| Sync logs | Text/JSON | Script stdout | Automation script execution results |
| Error details | JSON/Text | stderr | API errors, validation failures, rate limits |
| Notification receipts | JSON | AI Maestro API | Confirmation of sent messages to agents |

## Iron Rules Compliance

This skill is **READ + STATUS UPDATE ONLY**:
- Query project state via GraphQL API
- Update card status (Todo -> In Progress -> Done)
- Add comments and labels to issues
- Link PRs to project items
- **NEVER**: Execute code, run tests, modify source files

## Quick Start

### Authentication

```bash
# Verify gh CLI is authenticated
gh auth status
```

### Find Your Project

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query {
    repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
      projectsV2(first: 10) {
        nodes { id title number }
      }
    }
  }
'
```

## Issue Lifecycle Policy (NO STALE)

**IRON RULE**: Issues are NEVER automatically closed due to inactivity.

| Issue Type | Closure Conditions |
|------------|-------------------|
| Feature | Implemented + merged, OR explicitly declined with reason |
| Bug | Fixed + verified, OR 3 documented reproduction attempts failed |
| Chore | Completed and verified |

For inactive issues, use labels (`needs-attention`, `awaiting-response`, `low-priority`) instead of closing.

See [references/status-management.md](references/status-management.md#issue-lifecycle-policy-no-stale) for complete policy.

---

## AI Maestro Integration

For all inter-agent messaging, refer to the official AI Maestro skill:
```
~/.claude/skills/agent-messaging/SKILL.md
```

Use the `agent-messaging` skill to send notifications. For example, to notify the orchestrator, send a message using the `agent-messaging` skill with:
- **Recipient**: `orchestrator-master`
- **Subject**: Your notification subject
- **Content**: `{"type": "TYPE", "message": "MSG"}`
- **Priority**: The appropriate priority level
- **Verify**: Confirm message delivery via the `agent-messaging` skill's sent messages feature.

---

## Threshold Configuration

The `../shared/thresholds.py` module defines automation thresholds:

| Threshold | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES | 3 | CI failures before escalation |
| INACTIVE_HOURS | 24 | Hours before flagging inactive items |
| LONG_REVIEW_HOURS | 48 | Hours before review escalation |
| BLOCKED_ESCALATION_HOURS | 72 | Hours before user escalation |

See [references/automation-scripts.md](references/automation-scripts.md#thresholds-configuration) for usage.

## Examples and Inline Troubleshooting

For worked examples (finding/querying projects, updating issue status) and inline troubleshooting (project not found, issues not appearing, sync failures, rate limiting), see [references/examples-and-inline-troubleshooting.md](references/examples-and-inline-troubleshooting.md):

- E.1 Example 1: Find and Query a Project
- E.2 Example 2: Update Issue Status
- E.3 Inline Troubleshooting: Cannot find GitHub Project
- E.4 Inline Troubleshooting: Issue not appearing on project board
- E.5 Inline Troubleshooting: Column/status sync fails
- E.6 Inline Troubleshooting: Rate limiting from GitHub API
- E.7 Inline Troubleshooting: Claude Tasks and GitHub Project out of sync

For comprehensive error handling patterns, see also [references/error-handling.md](references/error-handling.md).

## Error Handling

When GitHub API calls or sync operations fail, consult [references/error-handling.md](references/error-handling.md) for retry logic, rate-limit handling, and authentication troubleshooting. All errors should be logged and, if unresolvable after retries, escalated via AI Maestro.

---

## Examples

For worked examples of finding projects, querying items, and updating issue status, see [references/examples-and-inline-troubleshooting.md](references/examples-and-inline-troubleshooting.md). That reference also covers inline troubleshooting for common failures such as missing projects, sync conflicts, and rate limiting.
