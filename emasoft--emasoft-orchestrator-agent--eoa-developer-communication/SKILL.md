# Developer Communication Skill

## Overview

This skill teaches effective communication with **human developers**

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of code review processes
- Access to communication channels (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- Familiarity with professional communication standards

## Output

| Field | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Communication Type | The type of developer communication (PR comment, issue response, technical explanation, status update, etc.) | String |
| Tone Assessment | Evaluation of message tone (respectful, specific, constructive) | Pass/Fail with notes |
| Blocking Status | Whether feedback is blocking or non-blocking | "Blocking" or "Non-blocking" |
| Message Content | The actual communication to send | Formatted text (Markdown) |
| References | Links to relevant code, issues, or documentation | List of URLs |

## Instructions

1. **Identify the communication type** - Determine if you are writing a PR comment, issue response, technical explanation, status update, or conflict resolution message.

2. **Understand the human-AI communication differences** - Recognize that human communication differs fundamentally from structured AI-to-AI message templates:

   | Aspect | AI-to-AI Communication | Human Communication |
   |--------|------------------------|---------------------|
   | Format | Structured JSON/templates | Natural language |
   | Tone | Neutral, task-focused | Warm, respectful, contextual |
   | Context | Explicit, complete | Often implicit, requires inference |
   | Feedback | Direct status codes | Nuanced, face-saving |
   | Timing | Immediate processing | Async, variable attention |

3. **Use the decision tree** - Navigate the decision tree below to select the appropriate reference document for your specific communication scenario.

4. **Apply the key principles** - Before drafting your message, review and apply all six key principles listed in the "Key Principles of Developer Communication" section.

5. **Draft your message** - Write your communication following the patterns and templates in the relevant reference document.

6. **Run the pre-send checklist** - Before sending, verify your message against the "Checklist: Before Sending Any Communication" to ensure quality and professionalism.

7. **Send and monitor** - Deliver the message through the appropriate channel and monitor for responses or follow-up needs.

## Key Principles of Developer Communication

### 1. Assume Good Intent

Every developer you interact with is trying to do good work. Code that seems "wrong" may reflect constraints, legacy decisions, or knowledge you lack.

**Instead of**: "This approach is wrong"
**Use**: "I noticed this pattern - was there a specific reason for this approach? I was thinking X might work because..."

### 2. Be Specific, Not Vague

Vague feedback wastes time and creates frustration. Always provide concrete examples.

**Instead of**: "This code could be cleaner"
**Use**: "Consider extracting lines 45-52 into a `validateUserInput()` function - it would make the login flow easier to test"

### 3. Separate Blocking from Non-Blocking

Clearly distinguish required changes from suggestions. Use explicit markers.

**Blocking**: "This will cause a null pointer exception when `user` is undefined"
**Non-blocking**: "Nit: Consider using `const` here instead of `let`"

### 4. Acknowledge Good Work

Recognition builds trust and encourages best practices. Point out what's done well.

**Example**: "Nice job handling the edge case for empty arrays here - that would have been easy to miss"

### 5. Provide Context for Your Feedback

Explain *why* something matters, not just *what* to change.

**Instead of**: "Use dependency injection"
**Use**: "Using dependency injection here would let us mock the database in tests, reducing test runtime from 30s to 2s"

## Decision Tree: Choosing Communication Type

```
Is this about code you're reviewing?
├── YES → See pr-comment-writing.md
│   ├── Is it a blocking issue? → Request Changes
│   ├── Is it a suggestion? → Comment (non-blocking)
│   └── Is it praise? → Approve with comment
│
└── NO → Is this about an issue/ticket?
    ├── YES → See issue-communication.md
    │   ├── Bug report? → Acknowledge, reproduce, respond
    │   ├── Feature request? → Thank, set expectations
    │   └── Question? → Answer or redirect
    │
    └── NO → Is this explaining technical decisions?
        ├── YES → See technical-explanation.md
        │
        └── NO → Is this a conflict or disagreement?
            ├── YES → See conflict-resolution.md
            │
            └── NO → Is this a progress/status update?
                ├── YES → See status-updates.md
                │
                └── NO → See templates-for-humans.md for general formats

## Quick Reference: Communication Tone

| Situation | Wrong Tone | Right Tone |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Code issue | "This is wrong" | "This might cause X - what if we tried Y?" |
| Suggestion | "You should do X" | "One option would be X - thoughts?" |
| Bug found | "You broke the build" | "The build is failing - looks like it's related to X" |
| Disagreement | "That won't work" | "I have concerns about X because of Y - how about Z?" |
| Confusion | "This doesn't make sense" | "Help me understand the reasoning behind X?" |
| Urgency | "Fix this now" | "This is blocking deployment - can we prioritize?" |

---

## Checklist: Before Sending Any Communication

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

- [ ] Is the tone respectful and professional?
- [ ] Did I assume good intent?
- [ ] Is feedback specific with examples?
- [ ] Did I separate blocking from non-blocking?
- [ ] Did I explain *why*, not just *what*?
- [ ] Is there anything to acknowledge or praise?
- [ ] Would I feel good receiving this message?

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Constructive Code Review Comment

**Wrong:**
> "This code is inefficient and poorly structured."

**Right:**
> "I noticed this loop processes items sequentially. Consider using `Promise.all()` for parallel execution - it could reduce the response time from ~500ms to ~100ms based on similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase."

### Example 2: Acknowledging Good Work

> "Nice catch on the null check at line 42 - that edge case would have caused issues in production. The error message is also very clear."

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Issue | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Misunderstood feedback | Developer responds defensively | Clarify intent, acknowledge their perspective |
| Unclear requirements | Developer delivers wrong implementation | Provide concrete examples and success criteria |
| Communication breakdown | No response for 48+ hours | Follow up with direct message, check availability |
