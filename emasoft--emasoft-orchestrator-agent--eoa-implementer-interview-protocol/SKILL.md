# Implementer Interview Protocol

## Overview

The Orchestrator (EOA) MUST interview the Implementer agent both **before** and **after** task execution. This is NOT optional. Skipping these interviews leads to wasted work, requirement violations, and integration failures. The pre-task interview verifies understanding, capability, compatibility, and feasibility. The post-task interview verifies completeness, quality, testing, and documentation before approving PR creation.

## Prerequisites

1. Read **AGENT_OPERATIONS.md** for orchestrator workflow
2. Read **eoa-remote-agent-coordinator/references/rule-14-immutable-requirements.md** for immutable vs. mutable requirements
3. Read **eoa-label-taxonomy** for status labels
4. Read **eoa-messaging-templates** for message formats
5. Access to AI Maestro API for agent messaging
6. Understanding of escalation paths (EOA → EAA for design, EOA → EAMA → User for requirements)

---

## 1. Pre-Task Interview (MANDATORY)

### 1.1 Purpose

Before the Implementer starts work, the Orchestrator MUST verify:

1. **Understanding** - Does the implementer understand the task?
2. **Capability** - Can the implementer do the task with available tools/skills?
3. **Compatibility** - Are there conflicts with existing code or architecture?
4. **Feasibility** - Are the requirements achievable as specified?

### 1.2 Interview Flow

```
ORCHESTRATOR                           IMPLEMENTER
     |                                      |
     |-- Task Assignment Message ---------->|
     |                                      |
     |<-- ACK + Understanding Summary ------|
     |                                      |
     |-- Interview Questions -------------->|
     |                                      |
     |<-- Answers + Concerns ---------------|
     |                                      |
     [Evaluate responses]                   |
     |                                      |
     |-- PROCEED or ESCALATE -------------->|
```

### 1.3 Interview Questions and Response Evaluation

**Full question templates and evaluation criteria**: [interview-templates.md](./references/interview-templates.md)
- Pre-task interview questions (5 key questions)
- Post-task interview questions (5 verification areas)
- Response evaluation tables for both phases
- Decision trees for PROCEED vs. escalate

**Key questions cover**: Task summary, acceptance criteria, concerns (requirements/design/capability/dependencies), implementation approach, and blockers.

### 1.4 Escalation Paths and Messages

**Full escalation templates**: [escalation-messages.md](./references/escalation-messages.md)
- Design issue escalation to Architect
- Immutable requirement escalation to Manager → User
- PROCEED approval message
- APPROVED approval message
- REVISE rejection message

**Escalation triggers**:
- Design concerns → Escalate to Architect (EAA)
- Immutable requirement concerns → Escalate to Manager (EAMA) → User
- Capability issues → Reassign or provide skills
- Blockers → Resolve before proceeding

---

## 2. Post-Task Interview (MANDATORY)

### 2.1 Purpose

After the Implementer reports completion, the Orchestrator MUST verify:

1. **Completeness** - Were ALL requirements implemented?
2. **Quality** - Does the code meet quality standards?
3. **Testing** - Were tests written and do they pass?
4. **Documentation** - Is documentation updated if required?

### 2.2 Interview Flow

```
IMPLEMENTER                            ORCHESTRATOR
     |                                      |
     |-- Completion Report ---------------->|
     |                                      |
     |<-- Post-Task Interview Questions ----|
     |                                      |
     |-- Answers + Evidence --------------->|
     |                                      |
     |                     [Verify responses]
     |                                      |
     |<-- APPROVED or REVISE ---------------|
     |                                      |
     [If APPROVED: Create PR]              |
     |                                      |
     |-- PR Created: #{NUMBER} ------------>|
     |                                      |
     |            [Notify Integrator]      |
```

### 2.3 Post-Task Verification

**Full post-task protocol**: [interview-templates.md](./references/interview-templates.md)
- Complete verification question template (5 areas)
- Response evaluation table
- APPROVED, REVISE, and escalation criteria

**Verification areas**: Requirements checklist, testing evidence, code quality, documentation, self-review.

**Outcomes**:
- All pass → Send APPROVED
- Minor issues → Request fixes, re-interview
- Major issues → Send REVISE with specific actions
- Requirement deviations → Escalate

---

## 3. Handoff to Integrator

### 3.1 When PR is Created

After implementer creates PR and reports the number:

1. Update issue status: `status:ai-review`
2. Notify Integrator via AI Maestro (template in **eoa-messaging-templates**)
3. Transfer responsibility from orchestrator to integrator

### 3.2 Responsibility Transfer

| Before PR Creation | After PR Creation |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Orchestrator responsible | Integrator responsible |
| Implementer executes | Implementer responds to review |
| Task tracked via issue | Work tracked via PR |

---

## 4. Exception Handling

**Full exception handling procedures**: [exception-handling.md](./references/exception-handling.md)
- Requirement disagreements (3 types with escalation paths)
- No acknowledgment received
- Misunderstood tasks
- Design change recommendations
- Incomplete work reports
- Test failures
- PR protocol violations

**Common exceptions covered**:
1. Implementer disagrees with requirements → escalate
2. Architect recommends design change → update and re-interview
3. User approves requirement change → document and proceed
4. Implementer never ACKs → reminder → escalate
5. Work reported incomplete → REVISE with specifics
6. Tests fail → REVISE, require passing tests
