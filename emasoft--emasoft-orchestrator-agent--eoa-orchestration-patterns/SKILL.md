# Orchestration Patterns Skill

## Overview

This skill teaches how to coordinate work among multiple developers using orchestration patterns.

## Output

| Output Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| TaskCreate calls | Task definitions with success criteria | `TaskCreate(subject="Implement module X", ...)` |
| Task assignments | Agent assignments via AI Maestro or Task tool | Message to remote-dev-001 with task details |
| Progress reports | Regular status updates from monitoring | "Task 1: 60% complete, Task 2: blocked on DB" |
| Completion signals | Verification of all tasks done | "All 5 tasks completed, ready for integration" |
| Escalation requests | Blocked task escalations to user/EAMA | "Task 3 blocked: missing API credentials" |

## Core Concepts

**Orchestration** is the act of coordinating multiple concurrent tasks performed by different agents to achieve a common goal. An orchestrator:
- Breaks down work into independent tasks
- Assigns tasks to the right workers
- Tracks progress and unblocks stuck work
- Manages communication and feedback

## Prerequisites

1. Multiple developers or task agents available for parallel work
2. A way to track task status (GitHub issues, task lists, or similar)
3. Clear task definitions with success criteria
4. A communication channel for status updates and escalations

## Instructions

### Procedure Overview

1. **Phase 1: Task Decomposition** - Break down the goal into independent, parallelizable tasks
2. **Phase 2: Task Assignment** - Assign tasks to developers with clear instructions
3. **Phase 3: Progress Monitoring** - Track task completion and identify blocks
4. **Phase 4: Escalation & Unblocking** - Handle blocked tasks and escalate when needed
5. **Phase 5: Integration & Verification** - Combine results and verify completion

## Examples

### Decompose and Delegate a Feature

This example shows how to decompose a feature request into tasks and delegate them.

**Input:** A feature request from the user (via EAMA):

```
Feature: Add user authentication module
Requirements:
- OAuth2 login with Google provider
- Session management with JWT tokens
- Rate limiting on login endpoint (5 attempts per minute)
```

**Output:** The orchestrator produces a task plan with assignments:

```
Task Plan: Authentication Module (3 parallel tasks)

Task 1: OAuth2 Integration
  Assign to: epa-backend-001
  Scope: src/auth/oauth.py, src/auth/providers/google.py
  Success criteria: Google OAuth2 flow completes end-to-end, tokens stored
  Dependencies: None

Task 2: Session Management
  Assign to: epa-backend-002
  Scope: src/auth/session.py, src/auth/jwt.py
  Success criteria: JWT issued on login, validated on protected routes, expires correctly
  Dependencies: None (uses mock OAuth response until Task 1 merges)

Task 3: Rate Limiting
  Assign to: epa-backend-003
  Scope: src/middleware/rate_limit.py, tests/test_rate_limit.py
  Success criteria: Login endpoint rejects 6th attempt within 60s window, returns 429
  Dependencies: None (uses mock login endpoint)

Result: 3 tasks delegated in parallel, each with clear scope and success criteria.
```

For more detailed orchestration examples with transcripts, see [orchestration-examples.md](references/orchestration-examples.md):
- Authentication module implementation from plan handoff
- CI failure coordination with investigation-first pattern
- Parallel code review across 5 developers
- Blocked dependency handling with parallel escalation

## Important Notes

1. **Never block the orchestrator** - Delegate all long-running tasks to agents
2. **RULE 17: Stay responsive** - Check AI Maestro messages regularly
3. **One task per agent** - Clear boundaries prevent conflicts
4. **Minimal status reports** - Request 1-2 lines only: "[DONE] task-name - result"
5. **Early escalation** - Identify blocks at first checkpoint; escalate immediately
6. **PROACTIVE monitoring** - Poll agents regularly; never wait passively
7. **4-verification-loops** - Only approve PR on 5th request if no issues remain
8. **Orchestrator-exclusive communications** - Sub-agents prepare content but NEVER send externally
9. **Parallel spawning** - Spawn up to 20 agents simultaneously for independent tasks

---

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Agent unresponsive | Agent crashed or blocked | Poll until response; reassign if unrecoverable |
| Task conflict | Same file modified by multiple agents | Assign non-overlapping scope |
| Verification loop stuck | Agent doesn't check changes | Send explicit verification message |
| Escalation pending | User unavailable | Queue issue, continue other work |

See individual reference files for detailed troubleshooting.
