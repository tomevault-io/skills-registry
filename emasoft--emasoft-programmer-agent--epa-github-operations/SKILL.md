# EPA GitHub Operations

## Overview

This skill provides the Emasoft Programmer Agent (EPA) with standardized procedures for all Git and GitHub operations. It covers the full lifecycle from cloning a repository, creating feature branches, committing code changes with conventional commit messages, opening pull requests via the gh CLI, and responding to EIA code review feedback. All operations use the gh CLI tool and follow the Emasoft ecosystem conventions for branch naming, commit formatting, and PR descriptions. This skill is used during workflow Steps 19 (create PR), 21 (respond to review), and 22 (push fixes after rejection).

This skill provides procedures for Git and GitHub operations within the Emasoft Programmer Agent workflow. Use these operations for repository management, branching, commits, and pull request lifecycle.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Cloning/forking**: When starting work on a new project or task
- **Branching**: When beginning implementation of a task
- **Committing**: When saving incremental progress or completing work
- **Pull Requests**: When submitting completed work for review (Step 19)
- **Review Response**: When addressing EIA review comments (Step 21)
- **PR Updates**: When pushing fixes after PR rejection (Step 22)

## Prerequisites

1. **gh CLI installed and authenticated**: Run `gh auth status` to verify
2. **Git configured**: User name and email set
3. **Repository access**: Read/write permissions to target repository

## Instructions

1. Verify that the gh CLI is installed and authenticated by running `gh auth status`. If not authenticated, run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts.
2. Clone or fork the target repository using `gh repo clone <owner>/<repo>` or `gh repo fork <owner>/<repo> --clone`. See [op-clone-repository.md](references/op-clone-repository.md) for details.
3. Create a feature branch from the latest main branch using the naming convention `<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>`. Example: `git checkout -b feature/123-add-user-auth main`. See [op-create-feature-branch.md](references/op-create-feature-branch.md).
4. Make code changes and commit incrementally using conventional commit format: `git commit -m "feat(scope): description"`. See [op-commit-changes.md](references/op-commit-changes.md).
5. Push the feature branch to the remote: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`.
6. Create a pull request using `gh pr create --title "<type>(scope): description" --body "..."` with a clear description linking to the relevant issue. See [op-create-pull-request.md](references/op-create-pull-request.md).
7. If the PR receives review feedback from EIA, read the comments with `gh pr view <number> --comments`, address each comment, commit fixes, and push updates. See [op-respond-to-review.md](references/op-respond-to-review.md).
8. After pushing fixes, update the PR description if needed and request re-review with `gh pr edit <number> --add-reviewer <reviewer>`. See [op-update-pr-with-fixes.md](references/op-update-pr-with-fixes.md).

## Quick Reference

### Branch Naming Convention

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

Examples:
- `feature/123-add-user-auth`
- `fix/456-resolve-memory-leak`
- `refactor/789-extract-utils`

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### PR Title Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
```

Example: `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support`

## Output

When this skill is applied correctly, the following artifacts are produced:

- **Cloned repository**: A local working copy of the target repository with remotes configured for upstream and origin.
- **Feature branch**: A properly named branch following the `<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>` convention, pushed to the remote.
- **Commit history**: One or more commits with conventional commit messages that clearly describe each change.
- **Pull request**: An open PR on GitHub with a descriptive title, body linking to the relevant issue, and appropriate reviewers assigned.
- **Review responses**: If review feedback is received, updated commits addressing each comment, with reply comments acknowledging the feedback.
- **AI Maestro notification**: A message sent to EOA (Orchestrator) confirming PR creation or update status.

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Feature Branch and PR for a New Feature

```bash
# Clone the repository
gh repo clone Emasoft/svgbbox

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/42-add-viewbox-parser main

# Make changes, commit with conventional format
git add src/parser.py
git commit -m "feat(parser): add viewBox attribute parsing"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/42-add-viewbox-parser
gh pr create --title "feat(parser): add viewBox attribute parsing" --body "Closes #42. Adds parsing support for the viewBox SVG attribute."
```

### Example 2: Responding to EIA Review Comments

```bash
# Read the review comments on PR #15
gh pr view 15 --comments

# Address the feedback by fixing the code
git add src/parser.py tests/test_parser.py
git commit -m "fix(parser): handle missing viewBox gracefully per review"

# Push the fix and notify reviewer
git push origin feature/42-add-viewbox-parser
gh pr comment 15 --body "Addressed review feedback: added null check for missing viewBox. Ready for re-review."
```

### Example 3: Handling a Rejected PR

```bash
# Read rejection reason
gh pr view 15 --comments

# Fix the issues identified in the review
git add src/parser.py
git commit -m "fix(parser): validate viewBox dimensions are positive numbers"

# Push fixes and update PR description
git push origin feature/42-add-viewbox-parser
gh pr edit 15 --body "Updated: Added dimension validation per reviewer feedback. Closes #42."
gh pr edit 15 --add-reviewer eia-feature-reviewer
```
