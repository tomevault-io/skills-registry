# Book Biography

Bibliographic research agent that analyzes books and manuscripts in Source Library, situating them within their networks of production, transmission, and reception.

## When to Use

- "Research this book's history"
- "Find other editions of this text"
- "Where does this manuscript fit in the tradition?"
- "Build a book biography for..."
- "What other versions of this text exist?"
- "Analyze the transmission of..."
- "Find related works to import"

## Invocation

```
/book-biography                           # Start interactive session
/book-biography [book_id]                 # Research specific book
/book-biography "Title or Author"         # Research by name
/book-biography import [book_id]          # Research and import related editions
```

## Core Disciplines

This skill applies methods from:

| Field | Focus | Application |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Bibliography** | Books as physical objects | Format, binding, typography |
| **Codicology** | Manuscripts as objects | Scribes, materials, construction |
| **Paleography** | Historical scripts | Dating, localization |
| **Stemmatology** | Textual transmission | Manuscript families, variants |
| **Provenance** | Ownership history | Stamps, ex libris, annotations |
| **Reception History** | How texts were read | Annotations, citations, influence |
| **Book History** | Social/cultural context | Patrons, printers, readers |

## Research Workflow

### Phase 1: Identification

1. **Get book from Source Library**
```bash
curl -s "https://sourcelibrary.org/api/books/BOOK_ID" | jq '{
  title, author, year, place, publisher,
  original_language, pages: .pages_count,
  image_source
}'
```

2. **Check source institution** (Gallica, IA, MDZ)
```bash
# For Gallica
curl -s "https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/ARK_ID"

# For Internet Archive
curl -s "https://archive.org/metadata/IA_ID" | jq '.metadata'

# For MDZ
curl -s "https://api.digitale-sammlungen.de/iiif/presentation/v2/BSB_ID/manifest"
```

3. **Extract physical description**
   - Shelfmark
   - Date and origin
   - Dimensions and format
   - Scribe/printer
   - Binding
   - Provenance marks

### Phase 2: Production Context

1. **Research the maker** (scribe, printer, publisher)
   - Web search for biographical info
   - Other works by same maker
   - Workshop/network connections

2. **Research the patron/owner**
   - Commissioning context
   - Collection history
   - Contemporary documentation

3. **Research the place/institution**
   - Printing center history
   - Scriptoria traditions
   - Library/collection context

### Phase 3: Textual Transmission

1. **Identify the text(s)**
   - Author attribution (real vs pseudonymous)
   - Original composition date
   - Genre and tradition

2. **Map the stemma (manuscript families)**
   - Key witnesses (MSS and early prints)
   - Siglum designations (A, B, C...)
   - Critical editions and their apparatus

3. **Position this witness**
   - What exemplar was it copied from?
   - What derives from it?
   - Unique readings or variants?

### Phase 4: Related Works in Source Library

```bash
# Search by author
curl -s "https://sourcelibrary.org/api/search?q=AUTHOR&limit=20" | jq '.results[] | {id, title, author}'

# Search by title/text
curl -s "https://sourcelibrary.org/api/search?q=TEXT_NAME&limit=20" | jq '.results[] | {id, title, author}'

# Search by theme
curl -s "https://sourcelibrary.org/api/search?q=THEME&limit=20" | jq '.results[] | {id, title, author}'
```

### Phase 5: Find External Editions

**Archive.org**
```bash
curl -s "https://archive.org/advancedsearch.php?q=creator:(AUTHOR)+OR+title:(TITLE)&fl[]=identifier&fl[]=title&fl[]=date&fl[]=creator&sort[]=date+asc&rows=30&output=json" | jq '.response.docs'
```

**Gallica**
- Search: https://gallica.bnf.fr/
- Check for IIIF manifests

**MDZ (Bavarian State Library)**
- Search: https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/
- BSB identifiers for import

**USTC (pre-1601 books)**
- https://www.ustc.ac.uk/
- Authoritative bibliographic data

**WorldCat**
- https://www.worldcat.org/
- Edition counts and library holdings

### Phase 6: Import Related Editions

```bash
# Internet Archive
curl -X POST "https://sourcelibrary.org/api/import/ia" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ia_identifier": "IDENTIFIER",
    "title": "Title (Editor/Translator Year)",
    "author": "Author; Editor (ed.)",
    "year": YYYY,
    "original_language": "Language"
  }'

# Gallica
curl -X POST "https://sourcelibrary.org/api/import/gallica" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ark": "ARK_ID",
    "title": "Title",
    "author": "Author",
    "year": YYYY,
    "original_language": "Language"
  }'

# MDZ
curl -X POST "https://sourcelibrary.org/api/import/mdz" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bsb_id": "BSB_ID",
    "title": "Title",
    "author": "Author",
    "year": YYYY,
    "original_language": "Language"
  }'
```
