# Security Framework Integration

## Problem
Smart contract projects need comprehensive security documentation, reusable security patterns,
and automated security tooling - but setting this up from scratch is time-consuming and easy
to miss important elements.

## Context / Trigger Conditions
- New Foundry/Hardhat project needs security documentation
- User wants to "add security best practices"
- Preparing project for external audit
- Setting up CI with security analysis
- Need reusable security contract patterns

## Solution

### Step 1: Create Documentation Structure

```bash
mkdir -p docs contracts/security test/security scripts
```

Create these docs based on ConsenSys best practices:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/KNOWN-ATTACKS.md` | Attack vectors with code examples (reentrancy, oracle, frontrunning, DoS) |
| `docs/SECURITY-PHILOSOPHY.md` | Core security principles (prepare for failure, rollout carefully, stay simple) |
| `docs/PATTERNS.md` | Secure code patterns (CEI, pull payments, safe calls, commit-reveal) |
| `docs/SECURITY-TOOLS.md` | Tool guide (Slither, Echidna, Mythril, Foundry fuzz) |
| `docs/DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` | Pre-deployment checklist |
| `AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md` | Growing checklist from audits |

### Step 2: Create Security Contracts

Essential reusable patterns in `contracts/security/`:

**CommitReveal.sol** - Frontrunning protection:
```solidity
abstract contract CommitReveal {
    mapping(address => bytes32) public commits;
    mapping(address => uint256) public commitTimestamps;
    uint256 public constant MIN_REVEAL_DELAY = 1 minutes;
    
    function commit(bytes32 hash) external { ... }
    modifier onlyRevealed(bytes32 secret) { ... }
}
```

**OracleConsumer.sol** - Secure oracle consumption:
```solidity
abstract contract OracleConsumer {
    uint256 public constant STALENESS_THRESHOLD = 1 hours;
    
    function _validatePrice(uint256 price, uint256 updatedAt) internal view {
        if (block.timestamp - updatedAt > STALENESS_THRESHOLD) revert StalePrice();
        if (price == 0) revert InvalidPrice();
    }
}
```

**PullPayment.sol** - DoS-resistant payments:
```solidity
abstract contract PullPayment is ReentrancyGuard {
    mapping(address => uint256) public pendingWithdrawals;
    
    function _allocatePayment(address payee, uint256 amount) internal { ... }
    function withdrawPayments() external nonReentrant { ... }
}
```

### Step 3: Add Slither to CI

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
slither:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        submodules: recursive
    - name: Run Slither
      uses: crytic/slither-action@v0.4.0
      with:
        target: 'contracts/'
        slither-args: '--exclude naming-convention,solc-version'
        fail-on: 'high'
```

### Step 4: Create Local Security Scan Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/security-scan.sh
forge fmt --check
forge build
forge test -vvv
slither . --filter-paths "lib|test"
forge coverage
forge test --gas-report > gas-report.txt
```

### Step 5: Update README

Add Security Documentation section linking to all docs and listing security contracts.

### Step 6: Configure External Auditors

Document audit workflow with AI auditors:
- @clawditor - General security, gas optimization
- @dragon_bot_z - DoS vectors, edge cases

## Verification
- [ ] All docs created and linked in README
- [ ] Security contracts compile (`forge build`)
- [ ] Tests pass (`forge test`)
- [ ] Slither runs without critical issues
- [ ] CI pipeline includes security analysis

## Example

## Notes
- Reference source: https://consensysdiligence.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/
- Also useful: https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts (Trail of Bits)
- Update AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md as you learn from audits
- Security contracts should use Solidity 0.8.20+ and custom errors
