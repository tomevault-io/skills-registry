# /feature-workflow

Autonomous end-to-end feature development. Fetches next task from task tracker and works independently until complete or help is needed.

---

## Context

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Task Agent** | `monday-agent` (swap for `jira-agent` etc.) |
| **Build Command** | `npm run build` |
| **Test Command** | `npm test -- --workers=1` |
| **Review Agents** | code-reviewer → silent-failure-hunter → code-simplifier |

### Tech Stack
Next.js 16, TypeScript, MUI, Firebase, next-intl (he/en/ru)

### File Structure
```
app/[locale]/     → Pages (server: page.tsx, client: *Content.tsx)
components/       → UI components
hooks/            → Custom hooks (useCelebration, useGameAnalytics, useFeatureFlags)
contexts/         → React contexts (FeatureFlagContext, StickerContext, StreakContext)
utils/            → Utilities (audio.ts, celebrations.ts)
data/             → Static data arrays
lib/              → External integrations (firebase.ts, seo.ts, featureFlags/)
```

### Key Patterns
- Audio: `playSound(AudioSounds.X)` for effects, `playAudio(path)` for content
- Celebrations: `useCelebration` hook with types: gameComplete, milestone, correctAnswer, streak
- Feature Flags: `useFeatureFlagContext().getFlag('flagName')` - defaults to `false`, enabled via Firebase Remote Config
- Category Progress: `useCategoryProgress` hook for tracking discovery/practice milestones. Wrap with category-specific hooks (e.g., `useLettersProgress`). Handles localStorage with proper error handling.
- Games Progress: `useGamesProgressContext()` tracks game completions, achievements (Simon scores, memory wins, etc.) for sticker unlocks.

### Known Gaps
- **Word audio files missing**: `/public/audio/words/` doesn't exist yet. `hebrewWords.ts` has `audioFile` paths but they 404. Don't add code to play these until files exist.
- **Explorer stickers not implemented**: Page 6 (Explorer) stickers have `unlockType: 'future'`. Pages 1-5 (Letters, Numbers, Animals, Games, Streaks) ARE fully implemented.
- **letter-tracing game disabled**: Game code exists in `app/[locale]/games/letter-tracing/` but is disabled (removed from games menu, sitemap, tests). Pixel-based and checkpoint-based validation approaches failed - checkpoint positions don't align with font-rendered letters. Needs a visual calibration tool or different approach (e.g., SVG paths instead of font rendering).

### Translation Key Patterns
Game translations have **inconsistent paths** - check before using:
- `speedChallenge`, `simonGame`, `letterRain` → Root level: `t('speedChallenge.xyz')`
- `countingGame` → Under games: `t('games.countingGame.xyz')`

Always verify the actual path in `messages/he.json` before writing translation calls.

### Testing Rules
- **Add tests**: New pages, new games, major UI changes
- **Skip tests**: Copy changes, styling, adding category items

## Design Philosophy

> Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back—show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

### Mindset

This is a **children's learning app**. Every feature should spark joy, wonder, and delight. Generic is the enemy. Safe is forgettable. Kids deserve magic.

**Before coding any UI, ask:**
- What would make a 4-year-old's eyes light up?
- How can this feel like play, not work?
- What unexpected detail would make this memorable?

### Creative Principles

**1. Bold Over Safe**
Don't settle for "it works." Push for "this is delightful." A button could bounce. A transition could whoosh. Success could explode with confetti. Take creative risks.

**2. Personality Over Polish**
Generic rounded rectangles are forgettable. Give elements character. A loading state could be playful. An error could be gentle and encouraging. Everything communicates.

**3. Reward Every Interaction**
Children need constant positive feedback. Every tap should feel responsive. Every correct answer should celebrate. Every milestone should feel earned. Use `useCelebration` liberally.

**4. Sensory Richness**
Combine visual + audio + motion. A card flip with sound. A success with confetti AND fanfare. Multiple senses = deeper engagement.

**5. Surprise & Delight**
Add unexpected moments. Easter eggs. Playful animations. Sounds that make kids giggle. The details they'll show their parents.

### UI Guidelines

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Touch targets** | Minimum 48px, larger for small fingers |
| **Typography** | Large, clear, playful - never small text |
| **Colors** | Pastel palette from `theme.ts` - warm, inviting |
| **Animations** | Bouncy, celebratory - use spring physics |
| **Feedback** | Every interaction = visual + audio response |
| **Layout** | Breathing room, one clear action per view |

### Sticker Guidelines

When adding stickers:
- **Be generous**: Kids love collecting - add 8-12 stickers per page, not 3-5
- **Unique emojis**: Never reuse the same emoji across different sticker pages
- **Progressive milestones**: Add multiple levels (e.g., Simon 5, 7, 10 - not just 10)
- **Mix achievement types**: Combine easy wins (play once) with challenges (perfect score)

### Design Anti-Patterns

- Generic UI that could be any app
- Subtle animations kids won't notice
- Small text or tiny touch targets
- Silent interactions (no feedback)
- Overwhelming complexity
- "Adult" aesthetics (sharp, minimal, cold)
- Stingy rewards (kids want MORE stickers, not fewer)

## Engineering Principles

### Efficiency & UX Impact

Before implementing, consider how code affects the user:
- **Bundle size**: Will this add significant JS to the client? Can it be server-side?
- **Load time**: Are images optimized? Can assets be lazy-loaded?
- **Runtime performance**: Avoid unnecessary re-renders, expensive computations in render
- **Memory**: Clean up intervals, listeners, subscriptions in useEffect returns
- **Perceived speed**: Use loading states, optimistic updates, skeleton screens

### Open/Closed Principle (SOLID)

This codebase constantly grows - new pages, games, categories. Design for extension without modification:

**Good patterns already in this codebase:**
- `CategoryPage` component renders any category via props - new category = add data file, not new component
- `AudioSounds` enum - new sound = add enum value, not new playback logic
- `ALL_GAME_TYPES` array - new game = add to array, tracking works automatically
- `FeatureFlags` interface - new flag = add property, infrastructure handles the rest

**When adding functionality:**
1. **First**: Can an existing component/hook handle this with a prop/config change?
2. **If creating new**: Can it be generalized for future similar needs?
3. **Red flag**: If you're writing `if (type === 'specificThing')`, consider data-driven design

**Data-driven over conditionals:**
```typescript
// ❌ Closed for extension - must modify to add new game
if (game === 'simon') { playSimonSound(); }
else if (game === 'memory') { playMemorySound(); }

// ✅ Open for extension - just add to config
const gameSounds: Record<GameType, AudioSounds> = { simon: AudioSounds.SIMON, memory: AudioSounds.FLIP };
playSound(gameSounds[game]);
```

### Clean Code

**Naming:**
- Components: `PascalCase`, descriptive (`GameProgressTracker` not `GPT`)
- Hooks: `useCamelCase` (`useGameProgress`)
- Files: Match main export (`GameProgressTracker.tsx` → `GameProgressTracker`)
- Translation keys: Hierarchical (`games.simon.instructions`)

**Single Responsibility:**
- One component = one clear job
- File exceeds ~200 lines? Consider splitting
- Extract complex logic into hooks

**DRY pragmatically:**
- Duplicate twice = OK
- Duplicate three times = extract
- Don't abstract for hypothetical "what if"

### Architecture Awareness

**Before creating a new file, ask:**
1. Does similar functionality exist? Search first.
2. Where do similar things live? Follow existing patterns (see File Structure in Context).
3. Will others know where to find this? Use conventional locations.

**Dependency direction:**
- Pages → Components → Hooks → Utils
- Never: Utils → Hooks, Components → Pages
- Contexts are accessed via hooks, not imported directly in components

## Workflow

```
ACQUIRE → EXPLORE → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → SEO → REVIEW → TEST → SHIP → RETRO
```

Execute phases sequentially. No approval gates. Ask for help only if stuck after 3 attempts.

---

## Phase 1: Acquire

**Goal**: Get next task from task tracker.

1. **Launch task agent** to fetch the next task:
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "monday-agent"` (or configured task agent)
   - Prompt: `"fetch"`
   - Agent returns: task ID, name, description, updates/comments, previous status

2. **Store the task ID** - you'll need it in Phase 8 to mark as Done

3. **If task is vague** (e.g., "fix issues", "validate", "improve"):
   - Explore the relevant code first
   - List specific issues found before planning fixes
   - If still unclear after exploration, ask user for clarification

4. Create task list with TaskCreate for task breakdown

5. If no tasks: Report "No pending tasks" and stop

---

## Phase 2: Explore

**Goal**: Understand codebase before coding.

1. Launch 2-3 Explore agents in parallel to find:
   - Similar features and patterns
   - Files that need changes
   - Existing utilities/hooks to reuse
   - Extension points (arrays, configs, types to add to instead of modifying)

2. Read all identified key files

3. **Evaluate architecture fit:**
   - Can existing components handle this with props/config?
   - If new code needed, where does it belong? (see Architecture Awareness)
   - What's the minimal change that solves the problem?

4. Update task list with specific files to modify/create

---

## Phase 3: Plan

**Goal**: Break down into concrete steps.

1. Create detailed task list (TaskCreate):
   - Each task = one logical change
   - Order by dependency
   - Include build verification step

2. Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

---

## Phase 4: Implement

**Goal**: Build the feature.

1. For each todo:
   - Mark `in_progress`
   - Make change following existing patterns
   - Mark `completed`

2. **UI translations**: Add strings to `messages/{he,en,ru}.json` for any user-facing text

3. **New game checklist**:
   - Add to `GameType` union in `models/amplitudeEvents.ts` (required for analytics)
   - Add to `ALL_GAME_TYPES` array in `hooks/useGamesProgress.ts` (for sticker tracking)
   - Add button in `app/[locale]/games/GamesContent.tsx`
   - Add to games array in `e2e/app.spec.ts`
   - SEO: handled in Phase 5

4. **Feature flags**: If feature needs gradual rollout, wrap with `getFlag('flagName')`. Add flag to `lib/featureFlags/types.ts` with default `false` (enabled via Firebase Remote Config)

5. **Tests** (if needed per Testing Rules): Add to `e2e/app.spec.ts`

6. Run **Build Command** - fix ALL errors before proceeding. If stuck, see Error Handling.

---

## Phase 5: SEO

**Goal**: Ensure new pages/routes are discoverable.

**Skip this phase if**: No new pages or routes were created.

### For New Pages:

1. **Add translation keys** in `messages/{he,en,ru}.json`:
   ```json
   "seo": {
     "pages": {
       "yourPage": {
         "title": "...",
         "description": "..."
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Generate metadata** in `page.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   export async function generateMetadata({ params }: Props) {
     const { locale } = await params;
     return generatePageMetadata(locale, 'yourPage', '/your-path');
   }
   ```

3. **Update sitemap** in `app/sitemap.ts`:
   - Add route to the `routes` array
   - Set appropriate priority (0.9 content, 0.6 games, 0.5 info)
   - Hreflang alternates are auto-generated for all locales

4. **Structured data** (if applicable):
   - FAQ page? Add FAQPage JSON-LD (see `learn/page.tsx`)
   - Game with scores? Consider adding Game schema

### Checklist:
- [ ] SEO translations in all 3 locales
- [ ] `generateMetadata` exports in page.tsx
- [ ] Route added to `app/sitemap.ts`

---

## Phase 6: Review

**Goal**: Catch issues before testing.

Run **Review Agents** sequentially. **Important**: Scope each agent to only the files you modified, not the entire codebase.

### 6.1 code-reviewer
- Prompt: "Review changes to [list specific files]. Focus on bugs, logic errors, guideline violations."
- Fix critical/high severity issues

### 6.2 silent-failure-hunter
- Prompt: "Review error handling in [list specific files] for silent failures."
- If issues are found in patterns you're copying from (e.g., useLettersProgress → useAnimalsProgress), fix BOTH:
  1. Your new code
  2. The original code you copied from
- This improves the codebase over time rather than propagating debt

### 6.3 code-simplifier
- Prompt: "Review [list specific files] for unnecessary complexity."
- Apply clarity improvements

After fixes: Re-run **Build Command**

---

## Phase 7: Test

**Goal**: Verify nothing broke.

1. Run **Test Command** (single worker avoids race conditions)

2. If fails:
   - **Failures in files YOU modified**: Fix the issue, re-run
   - **Failures in unrelated files**: Note them and proceed (pre-existing issues)
   - Re-run reviews if fix was significant
   - After 3 failures on YOUR code: Ask for help (see Error Handling)

3. If passes: Proceed to Ship

**Don't**: Use `git stash` to verify if failures are pre-existing. Just check if the failing test files relate to your changes.

---

## Phase 8: Ship

**Goal**: Commit, push, close task.

1. **Check working directory**: Run `git status`
   - If unrelated files are modified, ask user: "Include [file] in commit or revert?"
   - Don't silently revert or include without asking

2. **Commit** (types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `style`, `docs`, `test`):
```bash
git add <specific-files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

3. **Push**: `git push`

4. **Close task**: Launch task agent to mark as Done:
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "monday-agent"` (or configured task agent)
   - Prompt: `"done <item_id>"` (use the task ID from Phase 1)

5. **Summary**: Report files changed, decisions made, follow-ups

---

## Phase 9: Retro

**Goal**: Learn and improve the workflow.

Quick self-reflection focused on what went wrong, not what went well.

1. **Self-reflect**: What mistakes were made? What took longer than expected?

2. **If improvements identified**:
   - Update this skill file (Key Patterns, Known Gaps, Anti-Patterns, or phase instructions)
   - Commit the skill update separately from feature code

3. **Keep it brief** - 1-2 minutes max. Skip if nothing significant.

**Good retro outputs:**
- New anti-pattern discovered → add to Anti-Patterns
- New codebase pattern used → add to Key Patterns
- Workflow step was confusing → clarify instructions
- Missing context caused issues → add to Known Gaps

---

## Error Handling

### Ask for help when:
- Build/test fails 3+ times on same issue
- Requirements unclear
- Major architectural decision needed

### Format:
```
I'm stuck on [issue].

Tried:
1. [attempt]
2. [attempt]
3. [attempt]

Error: [specific error]

Options:
- [A]
- [B]

Which approach?
```

---

## Workflow Anti-Patterns

- Coding before exploring codebase
- Creating files when editing existing works
- Skipping reviews "because it's small"
- Over-engineering for hypothetical needs
- Committing without tests passing
- Forgetting UI translations for new text
- Skipping SEO for new pages
- Using `git stash` to verify pre-existing test failures (just check file names)
- Silently reverting unrelated working directory changes without asking
- Running review agents on entire codebase instead of scoping to changed files
- Adding code that references missing assets (check files exist first)
- Using `replace_all: true` without checking it won't break imports or create duplicates
- Copying code patterns from existing files without reviewing them (existing code may have bugs - e.g., `scale()` without value)
- Creating a new component when an existing one could handle it with props
- Hardcoding values that should be in config/data files
- Adding conditionals for specific cases instead of data-driven design
- Ignoring performance (large bundles, unoptimized images, no cleanup in useEffect)
- Creating files in wrong directories (e.g., business logic in `components/` instead of `hooks/`)
