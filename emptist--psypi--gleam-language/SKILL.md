## How Gleam Works

Gleam is a type-safe language that compiles to Erlang and JavaScript. It's small, fast, and catches errors at compile time.

### 1. Small + Pure = Resilience
Keep modules small. Pure functions preferred — side effects happen at the boundary (FFI/interop).

### 2. Type System First
Gleam's type system catches most errors. If it compiles, it usually works. Use custom types extensively to make invalid states impossible.

### 3. Exhaustiveness Checking
The compiler verifies all `case` expressions cover every variant. This is Gleam's superpower — adding a new variant to a type flags every incomplete `case` at compile time.

### 4. Pattern Matching Over Conditionals
Use `case` expressions for control flow. Gleam has no `if/else` — use `case` with `True`/`False` guards for boolean conditions.

### 5. Use Expressions for Callback Chaining
`use` eliminates nested callbacks. It's the idiomatic way to chain `Result`, `Option`, and other monadic patterns.

### 6. Pipe Operator for Readability
Chain operations with `|>` pipe operator. Gleam reads left-to-right.

### 7. Module Imports Use `/` Not `.`
Gleam module paths use `/` for submodules: `import generator/tool_call`, NOT `import generator.tool_call`. Dots are for record field access.

### 8. Functions Are Private by Default
Use `pub fn` to export. Unqualified function imports are discouraged — prefer qualified calls like `list.reverse`.

### 9. Int and Float Operators Are Separate
`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` work on Ints. `+.` , `-.`, `*.`, `/.` work on Floats. No implicit conversion.

### 10. Every Module Must Import Its Dependencies
`list.map` requires `import gleam/list`. The compiler tells you exactly what's missing.

### 11. Small Modules Prevent Edit Failures
Keep modules focused. Large files cause edit tool failures. Split into focused modules: one file, one responsibility.

### 12. Gleam is the Bridge, JS/Erlang is the Runtime
Gleam compiles to JavaScript or Erlang. At runtime, only the target exists. Gleam's job is to compose correct code for the target.
