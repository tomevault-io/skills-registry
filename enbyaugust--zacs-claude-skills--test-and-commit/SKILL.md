<phases>

### Phase 1: Run All Unit Tests

Run the full unit test suite first. Stop if tests fail.

```bash
npm run test:unit -- --run
```

| Result   | Action                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| All pass | Continue to Phase 2                  |
| Failures | Fix failing tests, re-run until pass |

If failures are in changed files, fix them. If failures are pre-existing/unrelated, inform user and ask how to proceed.

---

### Phase 2: Identify Relevant E2E Tests

1. Get changed files:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
```

2. Map changed files to E2E tests using these rules:

| Changed File Pattern               | Relevant E2E Tests                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `src/pages/Sessions*.tsx`          | `playwright/tests/session-*.spec.ts` |
| `src/pages/Accounts*.tsx`          | `playwright/tests/account-*.spec.ts` |
| `src/pages/Contacts*.tsx`          | `playwright/tests/contact-*.spec.ts` |
| `src/components/tables/*Table.tsx` | E2E for that domain                  |
| `src/hooks/use*.ts`                | E2E for features using that hook     |
| `src/services/*.service.ts`        | E2E for features using that service  |

3. List the relevant E2E tests found. If none are relevant, skip to Phase 4.

---

### Phase 3: Run and Fix Relevant E2E Tests

Run only the relevant E2E tests identified in Phase 2:

```bash
npx playwright test <spec-file> --retries=3 --timeout=120000
```

| Result   | Action                                    |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| All pass | Continue to Phase 4                       |
| Failures | Evaluate if failure is due to our changes |

**If E2E fails due to our changes:**

1. Read the failing test to understand what it expects
2. Fix either the code or the test as appropriate
3. Re-run until pass

**If E2E fails due to pre-existing issues:**

1. Inform user of unrelated failure
2. Ask whether to skip or fix

---

### Phase 4: Evaluate Coverage Needs

Assess if new tests are needed for the changed files.

1. Identify changed testable files (`.ts`, `.tsx` in `src/`, excluding tests)

2. For each file, check:
   - Does a corresponding test file exist?
   - Does the test cover the changed functionality?

3. Use AskUserQuestion if gaps exist:

```typescript
{
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Found coverage gaps. Create tests for these files?",
      header: "Coverage",
      options: [
        {
          label: "Yes, create tests",
          description: "Write missing unit/E2E tests",
        },
        { label: "Skip for now", description: "Commit without new tests" },
      ],
      multiSelect: false,
    },
  ];
}
```

---

### Phase 5: Write New Tests (If Needed)

If user approves, create tests following these patterns:

| Code Type | Test Type | Location                                |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Component | Unit      | `src/**/__tests__/[name].test.tsx`      |
| Hook      | Unit      | `src/hooks/__tests__/[name].test.ts`    |
| Service   | Unit      | `src/services/__tests__/[name].test.ts` |
| Page flow | E2E       | `playwright/tests/[feature].spec.ts`    |

Follow patterns in:

- `claude-patterns/testing-patterns.md` (unit tests)
- `claude-patterns/playwright-best-practices.md` (E2E tests)

Run new tests to verify they pass before continuing.

---

### Phase 6: Lint and Fix Errors

Lint all changed files:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx)$' | xargs npx eslint --max-warnings 0
```

| Result | Action                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Pass   | Continue to Phase 8                      |
| Errors | Run `--fix`, then fix remaining manually |

```bash
# Auto-fix what's possible
git diff --name-only HEAD | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx)$' | xargs npx eslint --fix
```

---

### Phase 7: Sync Documentation

Check if code changes affect documentation in `.claude/rules/` and `claude-patterns/`.

1. Get changed source files:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx)$'
```

2. Search documentation for references to changed files:

```bash
# For each changed file, search with multiple patterns
grep -rE "(src/path/to/file\.ts|filename\.ts)" claude-patterns/ .claude/rules/
```

3. For each doc file with references to changed code:
   - **Read the doc** to understand context (not blind find/replace)
   - **Verify the reference**: Does the file/function still exist?
   - **Identify staleness**: Has the path, name, or behavior changed?

4. Categorize updates needed:

| Update Type                       | Action                                             |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| File path renamed                 | Auto-update (context-aware, not blind replacement) |
| Function/type renamed (clear 1:1) | Auto-update with verification                      |
| Code deleted                      | Flag for user - may need doc section removal       |
| Pattern/behavior changed          | Flag for user - requires rewrite                   |
| Line number references            | Flag for user - inherently unstable                |

5. If updates needed, use AskUserQuestion:

```typescript
{
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Found stale documentation references. How to proceed?",
      header: "Doc Sync",
      options: [
        {
          label: "Update docs",
          description: "Apply context-aware updates, include in commit",
        },
        {
          label: "Review each",
          description: "Show me each change before applying",
        },
        { label: "Skip", description: "Commit code without doc updates" },
      ],
      multiSelect: false,
    },
  ];
}
```

| Result              | Action                                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Update docs         | Apply updates, continue to Phase 7             |
| Review each         | Show diff for each doc, apply approved changes |
| Skip                | Continue to Phase 8 without doc changes        |
| No stale refs found | Continue to Phase 8 (no prompt needed)         |

**Known Limitations:**

- May miss relative paths or partial filename matches
- Line number references become stale on any file edit
- Cannot detect semantic/behavior changes, only structural (renames, deletions)

---

### Phase 8: Commit

1. Stage changed files:

```bash
git add <files>
```

2. Commit with descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

</phases>

## Approval Gates

| Gate                  | Phase | Question                                              |
| --------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-existing failures | 1, 3  | "Tests failed but unrelated to changes. Skip or fix?" |
| Coverage gaps         | 4     | "Create tests for uncovered files?"                   |
| Doc sync              | 7     | "Found stale doc references. Update?"                 |

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Phase 1: Unit tests
npm run test:unit -- --run

# Phase 3: Specific E2E
npx playwright test <spec-file> --retries=3

# Phase 6: Lint changed files
git diff --name-only HEAD | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx)$' | xargs npx eslint --max-warnings 0
```

<guidelines>

## Guidelines

- Run unit tests before E2E (faster feedback loop)
- Only run E2E tests relevant to changes (not full suite)
- Fix test failures before adding new tests
- Lint after all test work is complete
- Ask user before creating new test files
- Sync documentation before committing to keep docs accurate
- Doc updates are context-aware reads, not blind find/replace
  </guidelines>
