# CR-Node — Diff-Scoped Node.js Review

Review scope: **PR diff + directly affected files only.**

Follow the review criteria defined in `rules/node.md`.

## Step 1 — Detect project context

Read `package.json` and check for:
- `express` dependency → enable Express-specific middleware checks
- `fastify` → enable Fastify plugin checks
- `koa` → enable Koa middleware checks
- `typescript` or `tsconfig.json` → skip checks covered by TS compiler
- `prisma`, `@prisma/client` → enable Prisma-specific query checks
- `sequelize` → enable Sequelize raw query checks
- `typeorm` → enable TypeORM query builder checks
- `mongoose` → enable Mongoose-specific checks

## Step 2 — Get PR context

Run these commands sequentially (no nested substitution):
1. `gh pr view --json number,title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,url` — store the `baseRefName` value
2. `git diff <baseRefName>...HEAD` — using the baseRefName from step 1
3. `git diff --name-only <baseRefName>...HEAD` — changed files list

## Step 3 — Expand affected scope

For each changed file, identify direct consumers (files that import/require from it) to catch breakage from interface changes. Only expand one level deep — do not crawl the entire dependency graph.

## Step 4 — Run review passes

Apply all 7 review passes and filtering rules from the criteria file against the diff and affected files.

## Step 5 — Output findings

Collect all findings with this format per issue:

```
### [SEVERITY] Pass N — file:line

**Issue:** one-line description
**Why:** reason you're confident this is a real issue
**Fix:** suggested code change
```

If no issues found: "✅ No issues found — all 7 review passes came back clean."

Show the user the findings.

## Step 6 — Autofix

Follow the autofix workflow defined in `rules/autofix.md`.

- **Local mode**: present the three options (create findings file as `cr-node-findings.md`, fix step by step, fix all)
- **CI mode**: post findings as PR comments with `/fix` and `/fix-all` reply instructions

- Do not flag issues that are clearly intentional based on git blame context.
- Run everything autonomously without asking to confirm each step (except the autofix choice in local mode).
