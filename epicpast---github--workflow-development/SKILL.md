# Workflow Development Skill

Design, debug, and optimize GitHub Actions workflows with security best practices.

## Trigger Phrases

- "create a CI workflow"
- "add a release workflow"
- "my workflow is failing"
- "make this workflow reusable"
- "workflow security audit"
- "add [language] CI"

## Security Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

### SHA Pinning

```yaml
# CORRECT
- uses: actions/checkout@8e8c483db84b4bee98b60c0593521ed34d9990e8 # v6.0.1

# WRONG - Never use tags
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### Minimal Permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read  # Start with minimum

# Only add what's needed:
# pull-requests: write  # For PR comments
# packages: write       # For container registry
```

## Reusable Workflow Pattern

### Caller (in project)

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  ci:
    uses: epicpast/.github/.github/workflows/reusable-ci-python.yml@main
    with:
      python-version: '3.12'
      coverage-threshold: 80
    secrets: inherit
```

### Reusable Definition (in .github repo)

```yaml
name: Reusable Python CI

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      python-version:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: '3.12'
      coverage-threshold:
        required: false
        type: number
        default: 80

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@8e8c483db84b4bee98b60c0593521ed34d9990e8
      - uses: epicpast/.github/actions/setup-python-uv@main
        with:
          python-version: ${{ inputs.python-version }}
      - run: uv run ruff check .
```

## Available Reusable Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `reusable-ci-python.yml` | Python with uv, ruff, pyright, pytest |
| `reusable-ci-typescript.yml` | TypeScript with pnpm, ESLint, Vitest |
| `reusable-ci-go.yml` | Go with golangci-lint |
| `reusable-release.yml` | Semantic release |
| `reusable-security.yml` | Gitleaks + dependency scanning |

## Composite Action Pattern

```yaml
# action.yml
name: 'Setup Python with uv'
description: 'Install Python and uv with caching'

inputs:
  python-version:
    required: false
    default: '3.12'

runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4
      with:
        enable-cache: true
    - shell: bash
      run: uv python install ${{ inputs.python-version }}
```

## Debugging Workflows

### Common Failures

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "Resource not accessible" | Missing permission | Add to `permissions:` |
| Cache never hits | Wrong key | Check hashFiles path |
| Secrets unavailable | Wrong context | Use `secrets: inherit` |
| Workflow not triggered | Event mismatch | Check `on:` config |

### Debug Step

```yaml
- name: Debug
  run: |
    echo "Event: ${{ github.event_name }}"
    echo "Ref: ${{ github.ref }}"
    echo "Actor: ${{ github.actor }}"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@0c907a75c2c80ebcb7f088228285e798b750cf8f
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/uv
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-uv-${{ hashFiles('uv.lock') }}
```

### Matrix Builds

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
    python: ['3.11', '3.12']
```

### Concurrency

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
