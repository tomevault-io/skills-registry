# Documentation Crawler Skill

This skill guides you through crawling documentation websites and organizing them either as structured documentation or as Claude Code skills.

## Overview

The documentation crawler follows a systematic workflow:

1. **Prerequisites Check** - Verify inform is installed
2. **Initial Crawl** - Try crawling the documentation URL directly
3. **Sitemap Discovery** - Fetch and parse sitemap.xml if needed
4. **URL Filtering** - Extract documentation URLs, exclude blogs/marketing
5. **Batch Crawling** - Use inform to crawl all documentation pages
6. **Content Organization** - Analyze and structure the content
7. **Choose Output Format** - Create skills or organize as documentation
8. **Repository Cleanup** - Remove intermediate artifacts

## Prerequisites Check

**Important: Choose the right download method**

Before using inform, determine if you need it:

- **✅ Direct download (no inform needed)**: If the documentation is provided as plain text files (.txt, .md, .rst, etc.), you can download them directly using `curl`, `wget`, or WebFetch
  ```bash
  # Example: Download markdown documentation directly
  curl -O https://example.com/docs/guide.md
  wget https://example.com/docs/api-reference.txt
  ```

- **⚠️ Use inform (required)**: If the documentation is served as HTML web pages, you must use inform to crawl and convert to markdown
  ```bash
  # Example: Crawl HTML documentation
  inform https://example.com/docs --output-dir ./docs
  ```

**Quick decision rule:**
- Plain text formats (.md, .txt, .rst, .adoc) → Direct download with curl/wget
- HTML web pages → Use inform tool

### Install inform (if needed)

Before starting with inform, verify it's installed:

```bash
# Check if inform is available
which inform && inform --version
```

**If not installed:**

```bash
# Quick install (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fwdslsh/inform/main/install.sh | sh

# Or via npm
npm install -g @fwdslsh/inform

# Or via Bun
bun install -g @fwdslsh/inform
```

## Step 1: Initial Crawl Attempt

Start with a direct crawl to understand site structure:

```bash
# Basic crawl with reasonable limits
inform https://docs.example.com \
  --output-dir ./docs-crawl \
  --limit 100 \
  --delay 500 \
  --concurrency 3
```

**Analyze results:**
- Check how many pages were crawled
- Review the directory structure
- Identify if important sections are missing

If the crawl captured most documentation, proceed to Step 6. Otherwise, continue to Step 3.

## Step 2: Sitemap Discovery

When direct crawling is limited, use the sitemap:

```bash
# Common sitemap locations
https://example.com/sitemap.xml
https://example.com/docs/sitemap.xml
```

**Fetch and extract URLs:**

Use WebFetch to extract URLs:
```
WebFetch the sitemap URL with prompt:
"Extract all URLs from this sitemap. List URLs under /docs/ or /documentation/ paths.
Exclude blog posts (/blog/), case studies, marketing pages, and changelog entries."
```

**Alternative: Parse manually**

```bash
curl https://example.com/sitemap.xml | grep -oP '(?<=<loc>)[^<]+' | grep '/docs/'
```

## Step 3: Filter Documentation URLs

Create a filtered list. Include patterns like:
- `/docs/`, `/documentation/`, `/guide/`, `/tutorial/`, `/reference/`, `/api/`

Exclude patterns like:
- `/blog/`, `/news/`, `/case-studies/`, `/changelog/`, `/pricing/`, `/about/`

**Create inform config:**

```yaml
# docs-config.yaml
globals:
  outputDir: ./docs-full
  delay: 500
  concurrency: 5
  ignoreErrors: true
  limit: 500

targets:
  - url: https://example.com/docs/getting-started
  - url: https://example.com/docs/concepts
  - url: https://example.com/docs/api
```

## Step 4: Batch Crawling

Execute the crawl:

```bash
# Using config file
inform docs-config.yaml

# Or crawl URLs individually
for url in $(cat doc-urls.txt); do
  inform "$url" --output-dir ./docs-full --delay 300
done
```

**Monitor progress:**
```bash
find ./docs-full -name "*.md" | wc -l
du -sh ./docs-full
```

## Step 5: Organize Content Structure

Analyze the crawled content:

```bash
# List all markdown files
find ./docs-full -name "*.md" -type f | sort

# Check file sizes
find ./docs-full -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -n

# Identify main sections
find ./docs-full -type d -maxdepth 2
```

Common documentation structures:
- Getting Started / Quick Start
- Core Concepts / Fundamentals
- Guides / Tutorials
- API Reference
- Troubleshooting / FAQ

## Step 6: Choose Output Format

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always ask the user first!**

Before proceeding, you **MUST** ask the user what they want to do with the crawled documentation:

1. **What is the desired output?**
   - Just organize documentation files?
   - Create a Claude Code skill?
   - Create a plugin?

2. **If creating skills or plugins:**
   - Read [references/skills-guide.md](references/skills-guide.md) to understand the complete skill creation process
   - Determine whether they need:
     - A personal skill in `~/.claude/skills/` (user-specific)
     - A project skill in `.claude/skills/` (shared with team)
     - A plugin skill in a plugin directory (distributed via marketplace)

3. **Clarify the structure based on the documentation:**
   - Understand the target location from skills-guide.md
   - Follow the appropriate pattern for that location
   - Ensure proper structure and frontmatter

**DO NOT assume what the user wants. Always ask and confirm before proceeding.**

---

After clarifying with the user, choose the appropriate path:

### Option A: Organize as Documentation Only

Simply organize the crawled markdown files into a clean directory structure:

```bash
# Create organized documentation structure
mkdir -p docs/
cp -r ./docs-full/* docs/

# Optional: Organize by category
mkdir -p docs/{getting-started,guides,api-reference,troubleshooting}
# Move files to appropriate directories based on content
```

**Use this when:**
- You want to keep the full documentation for reference
- The documentation will be accessed directly as markdown files
- You're building a documentation repository

**Then proceed to Step 8 (Cleanup)**

### Option B: Create Claude Code Skills

**📖 READ [references/skills-guide.md](references/skills-guide.md) for complete skill structure details.**

After reading the guide, create skills based on the target location:

**Skill types summary:**

1. **Personal skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`): User-specific, self-contained (10-20KB)
2. **Project skills** (`.claude/skills/`): Team-shared, self-contained (10-20KB)
3. **Plugin skills** (plugin directory): Marketplace distribution, concise SKILL.md (5-15KB) + references/

**Key principles:**
- Personal/Project skills: Self-contained, no references directory
- Plugin skills: Concise main file + detailed references/
- All types: Clear frontmatter, practical examples, focused content
- Refer to skills-guide.md for detailed structure and best practices

## Step 7: Validate Quality

### For Documentation Organization:

```bash
# Check directory structure
tree docs/ -L 2

# Check total size
du -sh docs/
```

### For Skills:

```bash
# Check SKILL.md size (plugin: under 15KB, .claude/: under 20KB)
ls -lh skills/tool-name/SKILL.md

# Check line count (plugin: 200-500 lines, .claude/: 300-700 lines)
wc -l skills/tool-name/SKILL.md

# Validate plugin structure if creating plugin skill
claude plugin validate .
```

**Quality checklist for skills:**
- [ ] ⚠️ Asked user about desired output format and skill type
- [ ] 📖 Read skills-guide.md and followed structure requirements
- [ ] Frontmatter with name and description
- [ ] Practical examples and use cases with code
- [ ] Appropriate file size (plugin: 5-15KB, personal/project: 10-20KB)
- [ ] (Plugin only) References directory with detailed docs

## Step 8: Clean Up Repository

After organizing documentation or creating skills:

```bash
# Remove temporary crawl directories
rm -rf docs-full/ docs-crawl/ *-docs-full/ *-crawl/

# Remove temporary config files
rm -f *-config.yaml sitemap.xml doc-urls.txt *.tmp

# Keep final output
# - If Option A: keep docs/ directory
# - If Option B: keep skills/ directory
```

**Update .gitignore:**

```bash
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
# Crawl artifacts (temporary)
docs-full/
docs-crawl/
*-docs-full/
*-crawl/

# Config files (temporary)
*-config.yaml
sitemap.xml
doc-urls.txt

# Temporary files
*.tmp
.DS_Store

# System files
Thumbs.db
EOF
```

## Example Workflow

Complete example for creating a plugin skill:

```bash
# 1. Crawl documentation
inform https://example.com/docs --output-dir ./docs-crawl --limit 200

# 2. Analyze and create structure
find ./docs-crawl -name "*.md" | head -20
mkdir -p skills/tool-name/references

# 3. Create concise SKILL.md (refer to skills-guide.md for structure)
# Write SKILL.md with quick reference, common use cases, links to references

# 4. Organize full docs as references
cp -r ./docs-crawl/* skills/tool-name/references/

# 5. Validate and clean up
ls -lh skills/tool-name/SKILL.md
rm -rf docs-crawl/
```

For documentation-only or personal/project skills, adjust paths accordingly and refer to skills-guide.md.

## Tips for Success

1. **Ask first** - Always ask user what they want (docs vs skills, personal vs project vs plugin)
2. **Read skills-guide.md** - Essential for understanding skill structure and best practices
3. **Start small** - Test crawl with a few pages first
4. **Respect rate limits** - Use appropriate delays and concurrency
5. **Verify content quality** - Review extracted markdown before organizing
6. **Keep skills concise** - Quality over quantity, follow size guidelines from skills-guide.md
