# Context Memory Skill

Saves and searches past Claude Code sessions so context, decisions, and code persist across conversations.

## Trigger Phrases

Activate this skill when the user says:
- "remember this" / "save this session" / "store this for later"
- "recall" / "search past sessions"
- "what did we discuss about..."
- "find previous work on..."
- "look up past decisions about..."
- "context memory"

Do NOT activate for:
- General file storage or note-taking requests
- Bookmark or URL management
- Requests about Claude's built-in memory features

## Database Location

- Database: `~/.claude/context-memory/context.db`
- Scripts: `~/.claude/skills/context-memory/scripts/`

## Commands

### /remember [note]
Save the current session with an optional annotation.

### /recall \<query\> [options]
Search past sessions.
- `--project`: Limit to current project
- `--detailed`: Include full message content and code snippets
- `--limit N`: Maximum results (default: 10)

## Examples

### Example 1: Save after a debugging session
User says: `/remember "Fixed the JWT refresh bug"`
Actions:
1. Analyze conversation, generate structured summary
2. Extract topics: `debugging`, `jwt`, `authentication`
3. Select key messages capturing the problem and fix
4. Write JSON with all fields and save via `--json`
Result: "Session saved. **Summary**: Fixed JWT refresh token expiration bug by adding clock skew tolerance. **Topics**: debugging, jwt, authentication. **Messages**: 8 saved. **Snippets**: 1 saved. **Note**: Fixed the JWT refresh bug."

### Example 2: Find past work on a topic
User says: "what did we discuss about database migrations?"
Actions:
1. Run `db_search.py "database migrations" --format markdown`
2. Present matching sessions with summaries and topics
Result: Sessions displayed with brief summaries. Offer `--detailed` for full context.

### Example 3: Deep dive into a past session
User says: `/recall authentication --detailed`
Actions:
1. Run `db_search.py "authentication" --detailed --format markdown`
2. Present full summaries, key messages, and code snippets
Result: Complete session context with decisions, messages, and code excerpts in expandable sections.

## Saving a Session

When the user wants to save/remember the current session:

1. Generate a structured summary:
   - **brief**: One-line summary of what was accomplished
   - **detailed**: 2-3 paragraph detailed summary
   - **key_decisions**: List of important decisions made
   - **problems_solved**: List of problems that were resolved
   - **technologies**: List of technologies/tools used
   - **outcome**: success | partial | abandoned

2. Extract 3-8 relevant topics (lowercase, e.g., "authentication", "react", "debugging")

3. Identify significant code snippets worth preserving

4. Select 5-15 key messages that capture the problem, decisions, and solutions

5. Pipe the JSON via stdin using `--json -`:
```bash
python "~/.claude/skills/context-memory/scripts/db_save.py" --json - << 'ENDJSON'
{
  "session_id": "<UNIQUE_ID>",
  "project_path": "<PROJECT_PATH>",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}
  ],
  "summary": {
    "brief": "One-line summary",
    "detailed": "Full 2-3 paragraph summary...",
    "key_decisions": ["Decision 1", "Decision 2"],
    "problems_solved": ["Problem 1"],
    "technologies": ["python", "sqlite"],
    "outcome": "success"
  },
  "topics": ["topic1", "topic2"],
  "code_snippets": [
    {
      "code": "def example(): pass",
      "language": "python",
      "description": "What this does",
      "file_path": "src/example.py"
    }
  ],
  "user_note": "User's note or null"
}
ENDJSON
```

**Important**: Always use `--json -` (stdin) for /remember saves. This avoids temp file issues on Windows. The CLI args path (`--brief`, `--topics`) only saves a subset of fields and leaves `--detailed` recall empty.

6. Report back: confirmation, brief summary, topics extracted, message/snippet counts, user note included.

## Searching Past Sessions

When the user wants to recall/search past sessions:

1. Run the search:
```bash
python "~/.claude/skills/context-memory/scripts/db_search.py" "<QUERY>" --format markdown [--project "$(pwd)"] [--detailed] [--limit N]
```

2. Present results in a clear, scannable format.

3. If results are insufficient, offer to:
   - Broaden the search query
   - Remove the `--project` filter
   - Search with `--detailed` for deeper content

## Output Format

```markdown
# Context Memory Results
**Query**: "authentication"
**Results**: 3 sessions

---
## 1. 2026-01-15 | my-app (Match #1)
**Summary**: Implemented JWT auth with refresh token rotation
**Topics**: authentication, JWT, security, Node.js
**Decisions**:
- Use RS256 for token signing
- 15-minute access token expiry

<details><summary>Full Context</summary>
[Detailed content here]
</details>
```

## Error Handling

- **Database doesn't exist**: Auto-created on first save. To manually init: `python ~/.claude/skills/context-memory/scripts/db_init.py`
- **Database locked**: Another process may be using it. Ask the user to check for other Claude Code instances and retry.
- **Save fails**: Check file permissions on `~/.claude/context-memory/`. The directory must be writable.
- **Search returns no results**: Suggest broader terms, remove `--project` filter, or try related keywords.
- **Empty database (fresh install)**: Show "No sessions stored yet. Use /remember to save your first session."

## Best Practices

1. **When saving**: Always use `--json` for full data. Always ask user if they want to add a note/annotation
2. **When searching**: Start with tier 1 (summary-ranked with topic/snippet boost), offer detailed search if needed
3. **Topics**: Use consistent, lowercase topic names
4. **Summaries**: Focus on the "why" not just the "what"
5. **Code snippets**: Only save truly reusable or significant code

## Pre-Compact Context Checkpoints

The plugin saves a full conversation checkpoint before Claude Code compacts context, preventing loss of detail.

### How it works

1. **PreCompact hook** (`pre_compact_save.py`) — Triggered automatically before compaction. Reads the transcript and saves all messages to the `context_checkpoints` table without truncation or sampling.
2. **`context_load_checkpoint` MCP tool** — Restores the full conversation after compaction. Accepts `session_id`, `project_path`, and optional `last_n_messages` parameters.
3. **Checkpoint pruning** — `db_prune.py` prunes old checkpoints (per-session and age-based) alongside regular session pruning.

The `context_checkpoints` table (schema v4) stores:
- `session_id`, `project_path`, `project_hash` — checkpoint identity
- `checkpoint_number`, `trigger_type` — sequencing and trigger source (`auto` or `manual`)
- `messages` — full JSON message array
- `message_count`, `created_at` — metadata

### Post-compaction recovery

After compaction, call the `context_load_checkpoint` MCP tool with the current project path to restore full conversation detail. Only use this when the compaction summary is missing information you need.

## MCP Tools

The optional MCP server (`mcp_server.py`) exposes these tools:

- `context_search` — Search past sessions (FTS5 + BM25 ranking)
- `context_save` — Save a session with messages, summary, topics, snippets
- `context_stats` — Database statistics (table counts, DB size)
- `context_init` — Initialize or verify the database schema
- `context_load_checkpoint` — Load a pre-compact context checkpoint
- `context_dashboard` — Launch the web dashboard in the background

Requires Python >= 3.10 and `pip install mcp`.
