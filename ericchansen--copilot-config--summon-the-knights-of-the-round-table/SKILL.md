# Summon Knights of the Round Table

Collaborate with multiple AI models to challenge assumptions, identify blind spots, and reach well-reasoned conclusions through structured debate.

## The Knights

Three models sit at the round table:

| Knight | Model ID |
|--------|----------|
| **Claude Opus** | `claude-opus-4.6` |
| **GPT-5.3-Codex** | `gpt-5.3-codex` |
| **Gemini 3 Pro** | `gemini-3-pro-preview` |

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Context

- Read the current plan.md if it exists
- Check recent git commits: `git --no-pager log --oneline -10`
- View recent file changes: `git --no-pager diff HEAD~3 --stat`
- Identify the key decisions or changes to review

### 2. Frame the Question

Formulate a clear question or set of concerns to review. Examples:
- "Is this the right architecture approach for X?"
- "Are these the correct priorities for the next sprint?"
- "What risks or blind spots exist in this plan?"
- "Should we tackle issue A before issue B?"

### 3. Assign Roles (Randomized)

Each invocation, **randomly shuffle** which knight gets which role. Do NOT always assign the same role to the same model. Use a random number or current timestamp seconds to pick a permutation.

The three roles are:

| Role | Prompt Suffix |
|------|--------------|
| **Devil's Advocate** | "Play devil's advocate. What could go wrong? What assumptions might be flawed? Poke holes in this." |
| **Explorer** | "What alternative approaches exist? What are we missing? Think outside the box and suggest unconventional options." |
| **Steelman** | "Steelman this approach. What's strong about it? Build the best possible case, then note what would need to be true for it to succeed." |

**How to randomize:** Pick a number 0–5 (e.g. use the current second mod 6) to select one of the 6 permutations:

| # | Devil's Advocate | Explorer | Steelman |
|---|-----------------|----------|----------|
| 0 | Claude Opus | GPT-5.3-Codex | Gemini 3 Pro |
| 1 | Claude Opus | Gemini 3 Pro | GPT-5.3-Codex |
| 2 | GPT-5.3-Codex | Claude Opus | Gemini 3 Pro |
| 3 | GPT-5.3-Codex | Gemini 3 Pro | Claude Opus |
| 4 | Gemini 3 Pro | Claude Opus | GPT-5.3-Codex |
| 5 | Gemini 3 Pro | GPT-5.3-Codex | Claude Opus |

**Announce the role assignments** at the start so the user can see which knight drew which role.

### 4. First Round — Divergent Perspectives

Query all three models **in parallel** using the task tool with model override. Each gets the shared context + question + their assigned role prompt.

```
Use task tool with:
  agent_type: "general-purpose"
  model: [assigned model ID]
  prompt: [context + question + role prompt suffix]
```

### 5. Synthesis Round

Compare the three responses:
- Identify points of agreement across all three (high confidence)
- Identify points of agreement between two of three (moderate confidence)
- Identify points of unique disagreement (need resolution)
- Identify unique insights from each

### 6. Resolution Round

If disagreements exist, query all three models again with the conflicting viewpoints:

```
prompt: "Knight A (role) said [X]. Knight B (role) said [Y]. Knight C (role) said [Z]. 
        These points conflict: [specific conflicts].
        Which perspective is strongest and why? 
        Can they be reconciled? What's the best path forward?"
```

### 7. Reach Consensus

Synthesize the final consensus:
- List agreed-upon conclusions
- Note any unresolved tensions with recommendations
- Provide actionable next steps

## Output Format

Present results as:

```markdown
## ⚔️ Round Table Review: [Topic]

### Role Assignments
| Knight | Role |
|--------|------|
| [Model] | Devil's Advocate |
| [Model] | Explorer |
| [Model] | Steelman |

### Context Reviewed
- [What was analyzed]

### Key Findings

**Unanimous Agreements (High Confidence):**
1. [Point all three models agreed on]

**Majority Agreements (2 of 3):**
1. [Point two models agreed on — dissenter's reason noted]

**Resolved Disagreements:**
1. [Initial conflict] → [Resolution reached]

**Open Questions:**
1. [Unresolved tension — recommendation]

### Recommended Actions
1. [Specific action]
2. [Specific action]
```

## Example Invocations
