# Sprint Report

Generate detailed sprint reports with progress metrics, issue breakdown, and velocity data.

## Quick Start

Use the Python script at `scripts/sprint_report.py`:

```bash
# Report for active sprint
python scripts/sprint_report.py PROJ

# Report for specific sprint
python scripts/sprint_report.py PROJ --sprint-id 123

# Include detailed issue breakdown
python scripts/sprint_report.py PROJ --detailed

# Compare with previous sprints (velocity)
python scripts/sprint_report.py PROJ --velocity
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PROJECT` | Project key (required) |
| `--sprint-id ID` | Report for specific sprint (default: active) |
| `--detailed` | Include issue-by-issue breakdown |
| `--velocity` | Include velocity comparison with past sprints |
| `--format FORMAT` | Output: compact (default), text, json |

## Report Sections

### Progress Summary
- Issues: done / in-progress / todo
- Story points: completed / remaining
- Percentage complete
