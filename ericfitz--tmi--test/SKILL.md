# Comprehensive Test Suite Skill

You are executing the TMI comprehensive test suite. This skill runs all test levels in sequence, stopping at the first failure to allow investigation.

## Test Execution Order

The test suite runs in the following order, with each stage only running if the previous stage passed:

1. **Environment Setup** - Clean and rebuild the server (PostgreSQL by default)
2. **Unit Tests** - Fast tests with no external dependencies (~5-10 seconds)
3. **Integration Tests** - Full database integration tests (~30-60 seconds)
4. **API Tests** - Postman/Newman API test suite (~2 minutes)
5. **CATS Fuzzing** - Security fuzzing with CATS (~9 minutes)

## Database Configuration

**Default**: PostgreSQL development environment (`make test-integration`)

**Optional**: Oracle ADB can be used if explicitly requested by the user during skill invocation. In that case:

- Use `make test-integration-oci` instead of `make test-integration`
- May need to reset database with `make reset-db-oci` if requested

## Execution Instructions

### Step 0: Environment Setup

Stop any running server and clean up, then rebuild and start fresh:

```bash
make stop-server
make clean-everything
make build-server
make start-dev
```

**Note**: Database reset is NOT performed by default. Only reset the database if explicitly instructed by the user.

Wait for the server to be fully ready before proceeding. You can verify with:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/ > /dev/null && echo "Server ready"
```

### Step 1: Unit Tests

Run unit tests:

```bash
make test-unit
```

**Analysis**:

- Look for `PASS` or `FAIL` in the output
- Check the final line for `ok` (pass) or `FAIL` (failure)
- If any test fails, report the failing test name(s) and error message(s)
- **Stop here if any unit tests fail**

### Step 2: Integration Tests

If unit tests passed, run integration tests:

```bash
make test-integration
```

**Analysis**:

- Look for `PASS` or `FAIL` in the output
- Check for database connection errors
- If any test fails, report the failing test name(s) and error message(s)
- **Stop here if any integration tests fail**

### Step 3: API Tests

If integration tests passed, run API tests:

```bash
make test-api
```

**Analysis**:

- Look for Newman test results summary
- Check for `assertions` passed/failed counts
- Look for `iterations` and `requests` counts
- If any assertions fail, report the failing endpoint(s) and assertion(s)
- **Stop here if any API tests fail**

### Step 4: CATS Fuzzing

If API tests passed, run CATS security fuzzing:

```bash
make cats-fuzz
```

This takes approximately 25-30 minutes. The output will show progress through various fuzzers. Check status every 5 minutes until the 20 minute mark, and then every minute until the 25 minute mark, and then every 30 seconds thereafter.

### Step 5: Parse and Analyze CATS Results

After CATS completes, parse the results. This takes approximately 3 minutes.

```bash
make parse-cats-results
```

Then analyze the database. Run these queries to understand the results:

```bash
# Summary statistics (excluding OAuth false positives)
sqlite3 test/outputs/cats/cats-results.db <<'SQL'
.mode column
.headers on
SELECT
    rt.name AS result,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) AS percentage
FROM tests t
JOIN result_types rt ON t.result_type_id = rt.id
WHERE t.is_oauth_false_positive = 0
GROUP BY rt.name
ORDER BY count DESC;
SQL

# Count OAuth false positives (expected, not real issues)
sqlite3 test/outputs/cats/cats-results.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as oauth_false_positives FROM tests WHERE is_oauth_false_positive = 1;"

# Actual errors by path (top 10)
sqlite3 test/outputs/cats/cats-results.db <<'SQL'
.mode column
.headers on
SELECT
    p.path,
    COUNT(*) AS error_count,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT f.name) AS fuzzers
FROM tests t
JOIN result_types rt ON t.result_type_id = rt.id
JOIN paths p ON t.path_id = p.id
JOIN fuzzers f ON t.fuzzer_id = f.id
WHERE rt.name = 'error' AND t.is_oauth_false_positive = 0
GROUP BY p.path
ORDER BY error_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
SQL

# Warnings by path (top 10)
sqlite3 test/outputs/cats/cats-results.db <<'SQL'
.mode column
.headers on
SELECT
    p.path,
    COUNT(*) AS warn_count
FROM tests t
JOIN result_types rt ON t.result_type_id = rt.id
JOIN paths p ON t.path_id = p.id
WHERE rt.name = 'warn' AND t.is_oauth_false_positive = 0
GROUP BY p.path
ORDER BY warn_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
SQL
```

**Analysis**:

- **OAuth false positives** are expected (401/403 responses from auth tests) - these are NOT real issues
- Focus on the **error** and **warn** results where `is_oauth_false_positive = 0`
- Report any actual errors by path and fuzzer
- Warnings are less critical but should be noted

## Reporting Guidelines

### On Success

If all tests pass, report:

- Unit tests: X tests passed
- Integration tests: X tests passed
- API tests: X assertions passed
- CATS fuzzing: X tests run, Y errors (Z oauth false positives excluded)

### On Failure

If any stage fails:

1. Clearly state which stage failed (unit/integration/API/CATS)
2. List the specific failing tests or endpoints
3. Include relevant error messages
4. Stop execution - do not proceed to later stages
5. Suggest next steps for investigation

## Important Notes

- **OAuth false positives**: CATS will flag 401/403 responses as "errors" but these are expected for auth testing. The `is_oauth_false_positive` flag identifies these.
- **CATS duration**: The fuzzing stage takes ~9 minutes - this is normal
- **Server must be running**: All tests except unit tests require the dev server (`make start-dev`)
- **Database required**: Integration and API tests require PostgreSQL (`make start-database`)
- **Clean state**: Starting with `make clean-everything` ensures no stale state affects results

## Database Schema Reference

The CATS results database has these key tables:

- `tests` - Individual test results with `is_oauth_false_positive` flag
- `result_types` - Result categories: `success`, `warn`, `error`, `skip`
- `paths` - API endpoints tested
- `fuzzers` - CATS fuzzer names
- `test_results_view` - Convenient view joining all tables
- `test_results_filtered_view` - View excluding OAuth false positives
