# Skill Teaching

Synchronize Claude Code skills to other AI agents in the project. This enables knowledge and workflow sharing across agents while preserving each agent's own skills.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Target Agent

Determine the target agent where skills should be synced:

- `codex` - OpenAI Codex agent (destination: `.codex/skills`)

### Step 2: Execute Sync Script

Run the sync script from the project root with the target agent identifier:

```bash
bash <base_directory>/scripts/sync-skills.sh <target> <project_root>
```

Where `<base_directory>` is the path shown in "Base directory for this skill:" output.

### Step 3: Verify Sync Results

The script performs these operations:

1. Reads previously synced skills from manifest (`.claude-synced-skills.json`)
2. Deletes only previously synced skills (preserves target agent's own skills)
3. Copies local skills from `.claude/skills/` (except `skill-teaching` itself)
4. Copies plugin skills from enabled plugins in `.claude/settings.json`
5. Writes updated manifest with list of synced skills

## Example Invocation

```bash
# Sync all skills to Codex agent
bash <base_directory>/scripts/sync-skills.sh codex
```

## Additional Resources

### Scripts

The skill includes a utility script for skill synchronization:

- **`scripts/sync-skills.sh`** - Executes the sync operation with manifest management
