# todo-gh-issue-import

Import open GitHub issues into local todo files using the configured todos directory (default: `docs/agent-todos/`).

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/). Before starting, verify it is installed and authenticated:

```bash
gh --version
```

If the command fails, inform the user:

> The `gh` CLI is required but not installed. Install it from https://cli.github.com/ and run `gh auth login` to authenticate.

Do not proceed until `gh` is available and authenticated.

## Workflow

### 1. Check Prerequisites

Run `gh --version` to verify the CLI is available. If not, show the installation message above and stop.

### 2. Fetch Open Issues

Use `gh issue list` to fetch all open issues from the current repository:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels --limit 100
```

If there are no open issues, inform the user and stop.

### 3. Determine Category

For each issue, determine the target category subdirectory under the todos directory:

- If the issue has a label that matches an existing category directory, use that label
- If a category argument was provided (e.g., `/todo-gh-issue-import data`), use it for all issues
- Otherwise, ask the user which category to use, or default to `misc/`

### 4. Create Todo Files

For each issue, use the `/todo-creation` skill to create the todo file:

```
Skill: todo-creation
Args: <category> <issue-title>
```

This ensures proper sequential numbering, file naming, and frontmatter generation.

### 5. Populate Content

After `/todo-creation` creates the file (with `status: new`), populate it with the GitHub issue content and update the frontmatter:

1. Read the created file path from the `/todo-creation` output
2. Update the file body with the issue content structured as:

```markdown
## Problem / Context

(content from the GitHub issue body)

## Tasks

- [ ] (extracted from issue body if possible, otherwise leave for the user)
```

3. Update the frontmatter `status` from `new` to `ready` (since imported issues already have content)

### 6. Close the GitHub Issue

After successfully creating and populating the todo file, close the GitHub issue with a comment:

```bash
gh issue close <number> --comment "Imported to <file-path>"
```

Where `<file-path>` is the relative path like `docs/agent-todos/data/0042_fix_soft_404_errors.md`.

## Example

An imported issue #7 titled "Fix soft 404 errors" with label "data" becomes `<todos-directory>/data/0042_fix_soft_404_errors.md`:

```markdown
---
title: Fix soft 404 errors
status: ready
projects:
- '[[my-project]]'
tags:
- todo
- agent-todo
---

## Problem / Context

(content from the GitHub issue body)

## Tasks

- [ ] ...
```

The GitHub issue is then closed with the comment: `Imported to <todos-directory>/data/0042_fix_soft_404_errors.md`

## Notes

- Only import open issues (closed issues are already done)
- If no label matches a category, ask the user or use `misc/`
- Imported todos always get `status: ready` since they already have content from the issue
- The `/todo-creation` skill handles sequential numbering and file naming conventions
- If `gh` is not authenticated, the user will see an auth error — direct them to run `gh auth login`
