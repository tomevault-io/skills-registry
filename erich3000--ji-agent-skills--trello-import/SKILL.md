# Trello Import Skill

Convert Trello board JSON exports into Markdown notes for Obsidian.

## When to Use

- User has placed one or more `*.json` Trello board exports at the repository root
- User wants to (re-)generate the `TRELLO_IMPORT/` folder structure

## Bundled Script

The converter script is bundled at `scripts/import_from_trello.py`. Run it from the repository root:

```bash
# Import one board only (recommended)
python3 .claude/skills/trello-import/scripts/import_from_trello.py 20260214_pok-pok-noodles.json

# Import multiple explicit boards
python3 .claude/skills/trello-import/scripts/import_from_trello.py 20260214_foodie-rezepte.json 20260214_hot-thai-kitchen.json
```

Do not run the script without explicit JSON file arguments.

## Behavior

- Read only the explicitly provided `*.json` files
- If a target board directory already exists, prompt for explicit approval before deleting/recreating it
- In non-interactive mode, always refuse overwrite of existing board directories
- Write to `TRELLO_IMPORT/<Board>/<List>/<Card>/index.md`
- Lists are sorted by Trello position and prefixed: `001 ListName/`, `002 ListName/`
- Each card gets YAML frontmatter (`title`, `board`, `list`, `trello_url`) plus sections for description and attachments
- Duplicate card names within a list get `[<card-id>]` appended for collision safety
- Filenames are sanitized (max 120 chars, safe unicode)

## Warning

**Destructive per imported board**: for each selected JSON file, the script deletes and recreates that board directory (`shutil.rmtree`). Never hand-edit files inside `TRELLO_IMPORT/`.
Overwrite is interactive-only: existing board folders are never replaced in non-interactive runs.

## Verify

```bash
find TRELLO_IMPORT -name index.md | head -20
```

## Recommended Follow-Up

After importing, run the `trello-media-download` skill to download Trello-hosted images locally.
