# Coding Conventions — Language-Agnostic Core

These rules apply to **all code** regardless of language or framework. For language-specific conventions, use the dedicated skills:
- TypeScript/JavaScript → `/typescript`
- Rust → `/rust`
- React/Next.js → `/react`
- Design patterns → `/design-patterns`

**Always check for project-specific overrides first** — look for `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` in the repo. Project rules override these defaults.

## Input Validation

- Trim whitespace before length checks (`.trim()` before `.min()`)
- Max lengths on ALL string inputs (including email — max 320)
- Validate external data at system boundaries (user input, API responses, deserialized data)
- Deeply validate imported/deserialized data — not just top-level fields
- Prefer graceful validation (return errors) over throwing for user-facing inputs
- Be explicit about transport boundaries: parse raw input once at the edge, convert it into typed domain data, and keep the rest of the system insulated from wire-format quirks

## Explicit Semantics

- Prefer explicit behavior over ambient magic — pass comparators, equality, clocks, randomness, codecs, and side-effecting capabilities in when semantics matter
- Avoid overly generic helpers with hidden behavior (`process`, `handle`, `run`) when the real operation has domain meaning (`compareUsersByCreatedAt`, `encodeSessionToken`)
- Prefer parameterizing behavior over subtype hierarchies — inject the operation you want rather than creating a new subclass just to override one step
- Prefer named arguments or option objects once positional parameters stop being self-evident, especially for booleans or repeated scalar types

## Network & Timeouts

- All outbound network calls have timeouts (language-appropriate mechanism)
- Timeout cleanup in finally/defer/drop blocks — not just the success path
- Cancel in-flight requests on component unmount or scope exit

## Resource Lifecycle

- Timers and intervals are cleaned up (unref in Node.js, cancel in other contexts)
- In-memory stores (maps, caches) have hard size caps with eviction
- Opportunistic cleanup in hot paths — don't rely solely on timers (especially in serverless)
- File handles, database connections, sockets are closed in finally/defer/drop blocks

## Race Conditions & State

- Double-submit guards on form/action handlers
- Stale request detection — verify the current request is still active before updating state
- All state updates guarded against stale/unmounted contexts
- Concurrent writes to shared state use appropriate synchronization

## Error Handling

- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable (not raw framework errors)
- Failed operations logged with context (URL, status code, operation name)
- No silent catch blocks — at minimum, log a warning
- Sensitive information never leaked in error messages (no stack traces, internal URLs, secrets)
- Error strings never fed into downstream processing
- Failed data fetches must not produce misleading "empty/zero" UI — distinguish "no data" from "fetch failed"
- Use `Promise.allSettled` over `Promise.all` when independent operations should preserve partial results on failure

## Environment & Config

- Env var parsing has fallbacks (not bare type conversion)
- Numeric config values clamped to sane ranges
- Missing required env vars logged at startup
- Secrets accessed server-side only — never in client bundles
- Keep runtime config entrypoints obvious — one place reads env/process config, the rest of the code consumes normalized values
- Prefer failing fast at startup for missing required config over discovering config gaps mid-request

## Imports & Dependencies

- Imports should reflect ownership boundaries — prefer importing from stable public modules over deep internal paths when the project exposes both
- Remove stale imports as part of the same change that made them unnecessary
- Avoid circular imports created by convenience barrels or cross-layer shortcuts
- If one module exists only to re-export unstable internals, reconsider the boundary instead of adding more imports to it

## Domain Values

- Do not scatter repeated string literals when they represent a closed set of valid values
- Promote reusable domain values into shared constants, enums, or equivalent typed constructs early
- If a value controls branching, validation, persistence, or network payload shape, it should usually have a named domain representation rather than ad hoc string literals
- Keep raw protocol strings at the boundary when needed, but map them into domain-level names as soon as practical

## Consistency

- Date/time APIs use UTC consistently
- String comparison case sensitivity is consistent across all operators
- Code formatting matches the project's existing style
- Import ordering follows project conventions

## Working Mode

- In greenfield code, choose the clearest architecture and strongest defaults up front: explicit boundaries, small pure functions, immutable-by-default data flow, and names that reveal intent
- In an existing repo, preserve local patterns unless they are actively causing bugs, confusion, or repeated churn
- Optimize for minimal, high-signal diffs in existing code — don't rewrite modules just to make them look like your preferred style
- When improving existing code, strengthen boundaries and naming at the seam you are already touching instead of doing broad style migrations

## Functional Completeness

- Features are actually wired up — state is set, handlers are connected, IDs are passed through
- Return values from functions are used (not silently discarded when they carry important data)
- If a feature creates items, there's a way to interact with them

## Code Organization

- Feature-based structure over type-based (`/user/` not `/controllers/`, `/models/`)
- Colocate related code — keep tests, types, and implementation together
- Flat over nested — avoid deep directory nesting when possible
- Single responsibility per file — one concept per file

## Code Hygiene

- No dead code — unused functions, variables, types, imports
- No stale comments that describe removed/changed behavior
- No commented-out code — use version control
- No duplicate logic — if a pattern appears twice, flag before a third instance

## Streaming References

- Keep transport-specific parsing guidance out of this core file
- If working on Server-Sent Events or another streaming transport, load the dedicated reference at [`references/sse-stream-parsing.md`](/Users/eric.huang/.agents/skills/coding-conventions/references/sse-stream-parsing.md)
