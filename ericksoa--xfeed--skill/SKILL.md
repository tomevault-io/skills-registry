# XFeed - Filtered X Timeline

Fetch your X timeline and filter it based on your interests defined in ~/.xfeed/objectives.md.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users want to:
- Check their X/Twitter timeline
- See filtered, relevant tweets
- Catch up on AI/ML news and research
- See what's happening in tech without the noise

**Trigger keywords:** twitter, x feed, timeline, tweets, what's happening, tech news, AI news

## Requirements

The xfeed CLI must be installed and configured:
- Logged into X (twitter.com) in Chrome
- Anthropic API key

## Commands

### Fetch Filtered Timeline
```bash
xfeed fetch --count 30
```

### Fetch More Tweets
```bash
xfeed fetch --count 50
```

### Fetch with Lower Threshold (More Results)
```bash
xfeed fetch --count 30 --threshold 5
```

### View Raw Unfiltered Feed
```bash
xfeed fetch --count 20 --raw
```

### View Current Objectives
```bash
xfeed objectives
```

### Check Configuration
```bash
xfeed config --show
```

## How It Works

1. Uses your Chrome session to access X
2. Fetches your home timeline with Playwright
3. Sends tweets to Claude Haiku for relevance scoring
4. Displays tweets scoring above threshold (default: 7/10)
5. Shows relevance reason for each tweet

## Objectives

Your interests are defined in `~/.xfeed/objectives.md`. Current focus:
- AI/ML research and breakthroughs
- Model releases and benchmarks
- AI safety and alignment
- Developer tools and productivity
- Major news (real events only)

Exclusions: rage bait, crypto promotion, engagement farming, political tribalism

## Output Format

Each tweet shows:
- Author and handle
- Time ago
- Relevance score [X/10]
- Tweet content
- Engagement metrics
- Why it's relevant

## Troubleshooting

**"Not logged in"**: Log into x.com in Chrome first
**"Not logged in"**: Your X session expired, log in again in Chrome
**API errors**: Check Anthropic API key in `.env`
