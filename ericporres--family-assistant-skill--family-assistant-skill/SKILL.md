# [YOUR LAST NAME] Family Assistant

Personal assistant skill for [YOUR NAME] and family. Load the appropriate reference file based on the task.

## Reference Files

| Task Type | Reference File | When to Load |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Identity, contacts, DOBs | [family-members.md](references/family-members.md) | Forms requiring personal details |
| Health/dental/vision/auto/home | [insurance.md](references/insurance.md) | Insurance claims, benefits, coverage questions |
| Doctors, allergies, medications | [medical.md](references/medical.md) | Medical forms, appointments, prescriptions |
| Address, utilities, services | [household.md](references/household.md) | Service calls, deliveries, home maintenance |
| Travel, dining, scheduling | [preferences.md](references/preferences.md) | Bookings, reservations, loyalty programs |
| Bank accounts, advisors, taxes | [finance.md](references/finance.md) | Financial forms, wire transfers, tax prep |

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Load only what's needed** - Don't load all references; select based on task
2. **Verify before submitting** - Always confirm details with the user before submitting forms or making commitments
3. **Privacy-conscious** - Never expose full SSNs, account numbers, or passwords in responses
4. **Proactive assistance** - Suggest relevant information (e.g., "I notice [Child] has a tree nut allergy - should I flag that on this form?")

## Common Workflows
