# Deploy to Production Skill

This skill automates the full deployment workflow for Northwest Custom Apparel's Pricing Index project.

## What This Skill Does

Executes a complete deployment pipeline:
1. Commits any uncommitted changes (auto-generated message)
2. Pushes develop branch to GitHub
3. Merges develop into main
4. Creates a version tag (e.g., v2025.12.23.1)
5. Pushes main to GitHub and Heroku
6. Returns to develop branch

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user says:
- "/deploy"
- "deploy to production"
- "push to heroku"
- "release to production"
- "deploy changes"
- "ship it"
- "release changes"

## Implementation

Execute these steps in order. **Stop immediately if any step fails.**

### Step 1: Check Current Branch and Status

```bash
# Verify we're on develop branch
git branch --show-current
```

If not on develop, inform the user and stop.

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain
```

### Step 1.5: Auto-Bump Cache-Bust Versions

**REQUIRED before committing.** For each modified `.js` or `.css` file detected in Step 1:

1. Get the list of changed JS/CSS files:
```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD | grep -E '\.(js|css)$'
```
Also check unstaged/untracked:
```bash
git status --porcelain | grep -E '\.(js|css)$' | awk '{print $2}'
```

2. For each changed file, extract the filename and find all HTML files referencing it with `?v=`:
```bash
# Example for mockup-detail.js:
grep -rn "mockup-detail\.js?v=" --include="*.html" .
```

3. Bump the version number in each matching HTML file:
   - **Simple number** (e.g., `?v=12`): increment by 1 → `?v=13`
   - **Date-based** (e.g., `?v=20260317`): replace with today's date in YYYYMMDD format
   - Use `sed -i` for the replacement. Example:
```bash
sed -i "s/mockup-detail\.js?v=[0-9]*/mockup-detail.js?v=13/g" pages/mockup-detail.html
```

4. Stage the modified HTML files so they're included in the deploy commit.

5. Report what was bumped:
```
Cache-bust: mockup-detail.js v12→v13 (1 file), mockup-detail.css v11→v12 (1 file)
```

**If no JS/CSS files were changed, skip this step.**

### Step 2: Commit Changes (if any)

Only run if there are uncommitted changes from Step 1:

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Get list of changed files for commit message
git diff --cached --name-only
```

Generate commit message based on changed files:
- Format: `Deploy: updated X files (file1.js, file2.css, ...)`
- If more than 3 files, show first 3 with "... and X more"

```bash
# Create commit with auto-generated message
git commit -m "Deploy: updated X files (file1, file2, ...)"
```

### Step 3: Push Develop to GitHub

```bash
git push origin develop
```

### Step 4: ASK FOR CONFIRMATION (REQUIRED)

**CRITICAL: You MUST ask the user for confirmation before proceeding to production.**

Display a summary and ask:
```
READY TO DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION?

Summary so far:
- Branch: develop
- Committed: X files
- Pushed to: GitHub (develop branch)

Next steps will:
- Merge develop → main
- Create version tag
- Push to GitHub (main) and Heroku (PRODUCTION)

Are you ready to proceed?
```

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to get explicit confirmation. **DO NOT proceed without user approval.**

If user says no or wants to stop, return to develop branch and stop.

### Step 5: Switch to Main Branch

```bash
git checkout main
```

### Step 6: Pull Latest Main (Safety Check)

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Step 7: Merge Develop into Main

```bash
git merge develop --no-edit
```

**CRITICAL: If merge fails due to conflict:**
1. Run `git merge --abort`
2. Run `git checkout develop`
3. Display error message to user:
   ```
   DEPLOY ABORTED: Merge conflict detected!

   Please resolve conflicts manually:
   1. git checkout main
   2. git merge develop
   3. Resolve conflicts in your editor
   4. git add . && git commit
   5. Run /deploy again

   You are back on develop branch.
   ```
4. **STOP** - do not continue with remaining steps

### Step 8: Create Version Tag

Generate tag in format: `vYYYY.MM.DD.N` where N is sequence number for the day.

```bash
# Get today's date
date +%Y.%m.%d

# Check for existing tags today to determine sequence number
git tag -l "v$(date +%Y.%m.%d).*"
```

If no tags exist for today, use `.1`. Otherwise increment the last sequence number.

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v2025.12.23.1 -m "Production deploy"
```

### Step 9: Push Main to GitHub (with tags)

```bash
git push origin main --tags
```

### Step 10: Push Main to Heroku

```bash
git push heroku main
```

### Step 11: Return to Develop Branch

```bash
git checkout develop
```

### Step 12: Display Success Message

```
DEPLOY SUCCESSFUL!

Summary:
- Committed: X files
- Version tag: v2025.12.23.1
- Pushed to: GitHub (develop + main) and Heroku

Main branch is now live at:
https://sanmar-inventory-app-4cd7b252508d.herokuapp.com/
```

### Step 13: Memory Audit (REQUIRED)

Before asking about session documentation, check MEMORY.md health:

```bash
MEMFILE="$HOME/.claude/projects/C--Users-erik-OneDrive---Northwest-Custom-Apparel-2025-Pricing-Index-File-2025/memory/MEMORY.md"
wc -l < "$MEMFILE"
```

- If **over 180 lines**: STOP and condense MEMORY.md before continuing. Move detailed content to topic files.
- If **under 180 lines**: Report the count (e.g., "MEMORY.md: 94/200 lines") and continue.

### Step 14: Session Documentation (REQUIRED)

Ask the user what type of work was done this session:

Use AskUserQuestion with options:
- "Bug fix" → Collect Problem/Root Cause/Solution/Prevention, add to `/memory/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`. If the fix changes documented behavior, also update MEMORY.md.
- "New feature or integration" → Add a concise entry to MEMORY.md (key facts, sync rules, gotchas only). If details exceed 10 lines, create/update a topic file instead.
- "Nothing notable" → Skip documentation, deploy is complete.

**Rules for MEMORY.md updates:**
- Only add sync rules, gotchas, key architectural decisions, and essential API facts
- Detailed implementation notes go in topic files (emb-builder-details.md, design-lookup-details.md, etc.)
- One-time script results, batch stats, historical counts → do NOT add anywhere
- After any update, re-check line count. If over 180, condense immediately.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Not on develop branch | Stop, inform user |
| Merge conflict | Abort merge, return to develop, show manual resolution steps |
| Push fails | Show error, suggest `git pull` first |
| Heroku push fails | Show error, suggest checking Heroku login status |

## Example Output

```
Starting deployment...

[1/12] Checking branch... develop
[2/12] Committing changes... 3 files staged
       Commit: "Deploy: updated 3 files (calculator.js, styles.css, index.html)"
[3/12] Pushing develop to GitHub... done

[4/12] CONFIRMATION REQUIRED...

       READY TO DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION?

       Summary so far:
       - Branch: develop
       - Committed: 3 files
       - Pushed to: GitHub (develop branch)

       Next steps will:
       - Merge develop → main
       - Create version tag
       - Push to GitHub (main) and Heroku (PRODUCTION)

       [User confirms: Yes, proceed]

[5/12] Switching to main... done
[6/12] Pulling latest main... already up to date
[7/12] Merging develop into main... done
[8/12] Creating version tag... v2025.12.23.1
[9/12] Pushing main to GitHub... done
[10/12] Pushing to Heroku... done
[11/12] Returning to develop... done

DEPLOY SUCCESSFUL! Version v2025.12.23.1 is now live.
```

## Important Notes

- Always verify you're on develop branch before starting
- Never force push - if push fails, investigate why
- Version tags provide rollback points: `git checkout v2025.12.23.1`
- If Heroku fails but GitHub succeeds, you can manually run `git push heroku main`
