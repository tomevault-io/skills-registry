# Project Manager — Skill Enforcement & Governance

> **Mission**: Keep the project aligned with its defined standards. Every line of code must follow the skills. No exceptions.

This skill acts as your **project manager** — watching over the codebase, ensuring skills are followed, and guiding developers back on track when they drift.

## Activation

This skill activates when:
- User creates, modifies, or deletes any code file
- User says "implement", "add feature", "build", "refactor", "fix", "optimize"
- User requests code review or asks "is this correct?"
- User creates a pull request or prepares to commit
- Any file changes in the project
- User says "check skills", "validate code", "are we following standards?"

**MANDATORY**: Before ANY code operation, this skill MUST:
1. Check which skills are active (read .claude/skills/)
2. Read relevant skill files based on the operation
3. Validate the operation against skill rules
4. Block operations that violate skills

---

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: Skills Are The Law

**Rule**: ALL code MUST comply with active skills. Skills override personal preferences, Stack Overflow answers, and AI suggestions.

**Rationale**: Skills exist to prevent bugs, security holes, and inconsistencies. Ignoring them defeats the purpose of bootstrapping.

**Correct** ✅:
```typescript
// Following typescript-standards skill
function getUser(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
  // Implementation follows error-handling skill
  try {
    return db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id]);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new DatabaseError('Failed to fetch user', { userId: id, cause: error });
  }
}
```

**Incorrect** ❌:
```typescript
// Violates multiple skills:
// - typescript-standards: using 'any'
// - error-handling: generic Error, no context
// - security-hardening: string interpolation in SQL
function getUser(id: any) {
  return db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`);
}
```

### Rule 2: Read Skills Before Acting

**Rule**: Before modifying ANY code, read the relevant skill files.

**Rationale**: You can't enforce what you don't know. Skills change; assumptions kill.

**Correct** ✅:
```
User: "Add user authentication"
AI: "I'll implement authentication. First, let me check the relevant skills..."
AI: [Reads auth-patterns skill]
AI: [Reads security-hardening skill]
AI: [Reads typescript-standards skill]
AI: "Based on the skills, I'll implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens..."
```

**Incorrect** ❌:
```
User: "Add user authentication"
AI: "Here's the code: [implements without reading skills]"
// Result: Uses wrong auth pattern, violates security rules
```

### Rule 3: Skill Drift Is Unacceptable

**Rule**: Code that diverges from skills must be refactored immediately.

**Rationale**: Small deviations compound into technical debt. Fix immediately while context is fresh.

**Correct** ✅:
```
AI: "I notice this function uses 'any' type, which violates the typescript-standards skill. 
     Let me refactor it to use proper types."
// Refactors on the spot
```

**Incorrect** ❌:
```
AI: "This uses 'any' but it works, so I'll leave it."
// Result: Technical debt accumulates
```

### Rule 4: Validate Before Commit

**Rule**: No commit without skill validation.

**Rationale**: Commits are promises. Don't promise non-compliant code.

**Correct** ✅:
```bash
# Pre-commit validation
python scripts/validate_bootstrap.py .claude/skills/
python scripts/check_skill_compliance.py src/
```

### Rule 5: Skills Evolve, Code Follows

**Rule**: When skills are updated, existing code must be updated to match.

**Rationale**: Skills represent the current best practice. Old code must be modernized.

**Correct** ✅:
```
Skill Update: "Now require explicit return types on all functions"
Action: Search codebase for functions without return types, add them
```

## Skill Monitoring System

### Active Skills Inventory

Maintain awareness of all active skills:

```
.claude/skills/
├── project-architecture/          [ACTIVE] Layer 0
├── typescript-standards/          [ACTIVE] Layer 1
├── git-workflow/                  [ACTIVE] Layer 1
├── security-hardening/            [ACTIVE] Layer 2
├── error-handling/                [ACTIVE] Layer 2
├── data-validation/               [ACTIVE] Layer 2
├── database-design/               [ACTIVE] Layer 3
├── api-design/                    [ACTIVE] Layer 3
├── auth-patterns/                 [ACTIVE] Layer 3
├── nextjs-patterns/               [ACTIVE] Layer 4
├── ui-engineering/                [ACTIVE] Layer 4
├── testing-strategy/              [ACTIVE] Layer 5
└── _bootstrap-manifest.json       [REFERENCE]
```

### Skill Change Detection

Watch for skill modifications:
- File modification time changes
- Content hash changes
- New skill additions
- Skill deletions

When skills change:
1. Alert the team
2. Update skill inventory
3. Identify affected code
4. Schedule refactoring if needed

---

## Code-Skill Compliance Validation

### Validation Process

Before any code operation:

```
1. IDENTIFY: What skills apply to this operation?
   └── File type → language-standards
   └── API route → api-design + security-hardening
   └── Database → database-design + security-hardening
   └── UI component → ui-engineering + accessibility-standards

2. READ: Load relevant skill content
   └── SKILL.md (core rules)
   └── references/patterns.md (approved patterns)
   └── references/anti-patterns.md (forbidden patterns)

3. VALIDATE: Check compliance
   └── Does code follow core rules?
   └── Does code use approved patterns?
   └── Does code avoid anti-patterns?
   └── Are performance budgets respected?
   └── Are security requirements met?

4. ENFORCE: Block or fix violations
   └── Block: Violations that cannot be auto-fixed
   └── Fix: Auto-fixable violations
   └── Warn: Minor deviations

5. DOCUMENT: Record compliance check
   └── Log which skills were checked
   └── Note any violations found
   └── Track fixes applied
```

### Per-File Validation

When a file is created or modified, validate against:

| File Type | Skills to Check |
|-----------|----------------|
| `*.ts, *.tsx` | typescript-standards, error-handling, testing-strategy |
| `*.py` | python-standards, error-handling, testing-strategy |
| `*.go` | go-standards, error-handling, testing-strategy |
| `api/**/*.ts` | api-design, security-hardening, auth-patterns |
| `components/**/*.tsx` | ui-engineering, accessibility-standards, testing-strategy |
| `db/**/*.ts` | database-design, security-hardening, privacy-compliance |
| `lib/**/*.ts` | typescript-standards, error-handling |
| `test/**/*.ts` | testing-strategy, typescript-standards |
| `*.test.ts` | testing-strategy |
| `.github/**/*` | git-workflow, devops-pipeline |
| `Dockerfile*` | container-orchestration, security-hardening |
| `*.yml, *.yaml` | devops-pipeline, security-hardening |

## Developer Guidance

### When Developer Says: "Implement X"

1. **Pause**: Don't write code yet
2. **Identify**: Which skills govern X?
3. **Read**: Load those skill files
4. **Guide**: Explain the skill-compliant approach
5. **Implement**: Write code following skills exactly
6. **Validate**: Run compliance check
7. **Commit**: Only when validation passes

### Skill Violation Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Developer Uses Deprecated Pattern

```
Dev: "I'll use getServerSideProps for this"
AI: "❌ STOP! Let me check the skills..."
AI: [Reads nextjs-patterns skill]
AI: "The skill explicitly deprecates getServerSideProps. 
     Use Server Components instead. Here's the compliant implementation:"
// Shows Server Component pattern from skill
```

#### Scenario 2: Developer Suggests Wrong Tech

```
Dev: "Let's add Joi for validation"
AI: "❌ STOP! Let me check the data-validation skill..."
AI: [Reads data-validation skill]
AI: "The skill specifies Zod as the validation library. 
     You cannot add Joi — it violates the consistency rule."
AI: "Use Zod instead. Here's the compliant pattern:"
// Shows Zod pattern from skill
```

#### Scenario 3: Developer Ignores Security

```
Dev: "I'll store the JWT in localStorage"
AI: "❌ CRITICAL VIOLATION!"
AI: [Reads security-hardening skill]
AI: "Storing JWT in localStorage is a CRITICAL anti-pattern (AP-001)."
AI: "The skill requires httpOnly cookies. This is non-negotiable."
AI: "Here's the compliant auth implementation:"
// Shows secure auth pattern
```

#### Scenario 4: Developer Writes Test Wrong

```
Dev: "Here's my test:"
// [Shows test mocking database]
AI: "❌ SKILL VIOLATION!"
AI: [Reads testing-strategy skill]
AI: "The testing-strategy skill says: 'NEVER mock the database'."
AI: "Use a test database instead. Here's the compliant pattern:"
// Shows test database pattern
```

## Automated Enforcement Tools

### Pre-Commit Hook (REQUIRED)

Install in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-commit hook for skill compliance

echo "🔍 Checking skill compliance..."

# Check skill files exist
if [ ! -d ".claude/skills" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: .claude/skills/ directory missing!"
    echo "   Run: python scripts/validate_bootstrap.py"
    exit 1
fi

# Run skill validator
python scripts/validate_bootstrap.py .claude/skills/
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Skill validation failed!"
    exit 1
fi

# Run version checker
python scripts/version_checker.py .claude/skills/
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Version check failed!"
    exit 1
fi

# Run compliance check on staged files
python scripts/check_skill_compliance.py --staged
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Skill compliance check failed!"
    echo "   Fix violations before committing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ All skill checks passed!"
exit 0
```

### CI/CD Integration

Add to `.github/workflows/skills-check.yml`:

```yaml
name: Skill Compliance Check

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  check-skills:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Check skills exist
        run: |
          if [ ! -d ".claude/skills" ]; then
            echo "❌ ERROR: Skills not bootstrapped!"
            exit 1
          fi
      
      - name: Validate skills
        run: python scripts/validate_bootstrap.py .claude/skills/
      
      - name: Check versions
        run: python scripts/version_checker.py .claude/skills/
      
      - name: Check compliance
        run: python scripts/check_skill_compliance.py src/
```

### Compliance Reporting

Generate weekly compliance reports:

```bash
python scripts/generate_compliance_report.py --week
```

Output:
```

## Skill Drift Detection

### Weekly Skill Review

Every week, run:

```bash
# 1. Check if skills are up-to-date
python scripts/version_checker.py .claude/skills/

# 2. Identify skill gaps
python scripts/analyze_skill_coverage.py src/

# 3. Generate drift report
python scripts/generate_skill_drift_report.py
```

### Drift Indicators

Watch for these signs of skill drift:

1. **Pattern Pollution**: New patterns appear that aren't in skills
2. **Library Proliferation**: New libraries added without skill approval
3. **Style Inconsistency**: Code style varies across files
4. **Test Erosion**: Tests skip or mock incorrectly
5. **Security Gaps**: New endpoints without proper validation
6. **Performance Regression**: Page load times increasing

### Corrective Actions

When drift is detected:

| Severity | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Critical | Block all new features | Immediate |
| High | Schedule sprint for fixes | 1 week |
| Medium | Add to technical debt backlog | 2 weeks |
| Low | Fix when touching file | Ongoing |

---

## Integration with Other Skills

### Depends On
- `project-architecture` — Knows the project structure
- `git-workflow` — Enforces at commit time
- `documentation-standards` — Compliance must be documented

### References
- All other skills — Validates against their rules

### Shared Decisions
- Error codes: Uses same error format as error-handling skill
- Logging: Uses same format as observability skill
- Validation: Reports use same format as testing-strategy skill

---

## Pre-Task Checklist

Before ANY development task:

- [ ] Read relevant skill files
- [ ] Understand applicable rules
- [ ] Know the anti-patterns to avoid
- [ ] Check for recent skill updates
- [ ] Validate plan against skills
- [ ] Ensure compliance tools are available

---

## Anti-Patterns

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Ignoring Skills
**What it looks like**: Writing code without checking skills
**Why it's dangerous**: Accumulates technical debt, introduces bugs, creates inconsistency
**What happens**: Code review rejects, production incidents, refactoring sprints
**Fix**: Always read skills first. No exceptions.

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Skill Shopping
**What it looks like**: Reading skills selectively to justify preferred approach
**Why it's dangerous**: Violates the "skills are law" principle
**What happens**: Inconsistent codebase, confusion about standards
**Fix**: Accept skills as written. Challenge them in the skill file, not in code.

### 🟠 HIGH: Delayed Compliance
**What it looks like**: "I'll fix it later"
**Why it's dangerous**: "Later" never comes. Debt compounds.
**What happens**: Massive refactoring needed later
**Fix**: Fix violations immediately.

### 🟠 HIGH: Partial Skill Reading
**What it looks like**: Skimming skills instead of thorough reading
**Why it's dangerous**: Misses critical rules and nuances
**What happens**: Subtle violations that are hard to catch
**Fix**: Read skills thoroughly. Use find/search for specific topics.

### 🟡 MEDIUM: Skill Version Confusion
**What it looks like**: Using old skill version after update
**Why it's dangerous**: Outdated practices persist
**What happens**: Inconsistency between old and new code
**Fix**: Check skill modification times. Review changelogs.

---

## Error Scenarios

| Scenario | Detection | Recovery | User Impact | Severity |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Skill file deleted | File hash check | Restore from git | None if caught | Critical |
| Skill modified | mtime comparison | Re-read skills | Dev confusion | High |
| Code violates skill | Pre-commit hook | Block commit | Delay | Medium |
| New skill added | Inventory check | Read and apply | Learning curve | Low |
| Skill inconsistency | Cross-skill validation | Fix conflict | None | Medium |

---

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case: Skill Contradiction
**Scenario**: Two skills give conflicting advice
**Handling**: 
1. Check skill layer (lower layer wins)
2. Check last modified date (newer wins)
3. If still conflict, escalate to project architect
4. Document resolution for future reference

### Edge Case: Missing Skill for Domain
**Scenario**: Need to work in area with no skill coverage
**Handling**:
1. Check skill-catalog.md for relevant domain
2. If exists, generate the skill first
3. If not exists, create custom skill following template
4. Never work without skill coverage

### Edge Case: Skill vs. Library Conflict
**Scenario**: Library's best practice conflicts with skill
**Handling**:
1. Skill wins — always
2. Document library limitation in skill
3. Create wrapper/adapter to enforce skill
4. Consider alternative library

---

## Compliance Metrics

Track these KPIs:

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Skill Compliance Rate | >95% | Automated checks |
| Pre-Commit Pass Rate | >98% | Git hooks |
| Skill Update Adoption | 100% within 1 week | Manual review |
| Violation Fix Time | <24 hours | Issue tracking |
| Developer Skill Awareness | >90% | Quarterly survey |

---

## Conclusion

**This skill IS the project manager.** 

It doesn't just suggest — it enforces. It doesn't just guide — it governs.

Every code change, every file creation, every refactoring MUST go through this skill. The skills are the constitution of the project. This skill is the supreme court.

**Remember**: 
- Skills are law
- Compliance is mandatory
- Drift is unacceptable
- Quality is non-negotiable

When in doubt, read the skills.
