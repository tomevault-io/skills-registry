# eser-rules: Skill Discovery & Rule Management

Two functions: (1) Discover and invoke relevant skills before ANY response,
(2) Manage development rules across skills.

## Quick Start

1. **Every conversation**: Scan message → Invoke relevant skills → Announce → Respond
2. **Rule changes**: Identify scope → Update skill → Validate → Test

## Skill Discovery (Mandatory)

**Before ANY response** (including clarifying questions):

1. Scan user message for applicable skills
2. Invoke relevant skills using Skill tool
3. Announce: "Applying skills: [list]"
4. Follow skill instructions, then respond

Even 1% probability requires checking skills first. This is not optional.

## Rule Management

1. Identify scope → choose skill (or create new)
2. Add/update rule in `.claude/skills/<name>/references/rules.md`
3. Validate: `npx -y claude-skills-cli validate .claude/skills/<name>`

## Available Skills
