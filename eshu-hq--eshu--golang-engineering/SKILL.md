# Golang Engineering

Use this skill for Eshu Go work. Repository guidance in `AGENTS.md`, package
`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `doc.go` wins over generic Go advice. Read the
reference files only when local repo guidance does not answer the question.

References:

- `references/go-best-practices.md` for default Go design, API, naming, error,
  and concurrency choices.
- `references/tdd-workflow.md` for red-green-refactor, regression tests,
  table-driven tests, and subtests.
- `references/documentation-guidelines.md` for package docs and doc comments.
- `references/verification-and-linting.md` for Go verification and linting.

## Mandatory Workflow

- MUST inspect the owning package docs and entrypoint/orchestrator before
  editing runtime, collector, reducer, storage, parser, query, or command code.
- MUST write or update the failing test before implementation for bug fixes and
  parser/runtime behavior changes.
- MUST cover every dispatch variant touched by a shared helper, constant family,
  query builder, replay path, or retry classifier. Do not rely on one
  representative case when the production code has multiple variants.
- MUST run `gofmt` on changed Go files.
- MUST run focused Go tests before broader package tests.
- MUST run `golangci-lint` when Go code changed unless the user explicitly
  narrows verification.
- MUST run `scripts/verify-package-docs.sh` for Go package changes under
  `go/internal` or `go/cmd`; new packages need `doc.go`, `README.md`, and
  `AGENTS.md` before they land.
- MUST run `scripts/verify-performance-evidence.sh` when Go changes touch
  Cypher, graph writes, runtime stages, workers, queues, leases, batching, or
  concurrency. New collectors are covered when they introduce those patterns.
- MUST report exactly what passed and what was not run.

## Design Rules

- Prefer simple, readable Go over clever abstractions.
- Prefer concrete types until a real consumer needs an interface.
- Define interfaces where they are consumed.
- Keep exported APIs narrow and package boundaries cohesive.
- Prefer the standard library before adding dependencies.
- Preserve error context; wrap with `%w` when callers may inspect the cause.
- Keep concurrency explicit and justified. Use `concurrency-deadlock-rigor`
  when workers, queues, locks, transactions, retries, or shared state change.

## Documentation Rules

- Document every new or changed exported identifier whose behavior is part of a
  package contract.
- Document unexported helpers when they encode a contract, storage/query
  assumption, concurrency rule, retry rule, or regression purpose.
- Update package `README.md`, `doc.go`, and package `AGENTS.md` when code
  changes alter the package contract or contributor guidance.
- For a new package, create all three package docs before merging:
  `doc.go` for godoc, `README.md` for humans, and `AGENTS.md` for future AI
  edits. CI enforces this with `scripts/verify-package-docs.sh`.
- Prefer short comments that explain intent, invariant, or failure mode; do not
  add comments that only restate the identifier.

## Review Checklist

- Local conventions and package docs were read.
- The behavior has focused test coverage.
- The test failed for the intended reason before the fix when TDD applies.
- API surface, naming, errors, context use, and package boundaries stayed clear.
- Concurrency and storage changes have an explicit safety argument.
- Verification evidence is listed with any gaps or remaining risk.
