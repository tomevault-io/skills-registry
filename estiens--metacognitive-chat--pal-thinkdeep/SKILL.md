# PAL ThinkDeep - Deep Investigation

Systematic multi-stage investigation for complex problem analysis.

## When to Use

- Complex architectural decisions
- Performance challenges requiring analysis
- Security concerns needing investigation
- Problems requiring hypothesis testing
- When surface-level analysis isn't enough
- Strategic technical planning

## Quick Start

```python
result = mcp__pal__thinkdeep(
    step="Investigating intermittent performance degradation under load",
    step_number=1,
    total_steps=3,
    next_step_required=True,
    findings="Beginning systematic investigation",
    problem_context="API response times spike from 50ms to 5s randomly",
    focus_areas=["performance", "database", "caching"],
    hypothesis="Unknown - needs investigation",
    confidence="exploring"
)
```

## Required Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `step` | string | Current investigation narrative |
| `step_number` | int | Current step |
| `total_steps` | int | Estimated total |
| `next_step_required` | bool | More investigation needed? |
| `findings` | string | Evidence and insights |

## Optional Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `hypothesis` | string | Current theory |
| `confidence` | enum | exploring → certain |
| `focus_areas` | list | ["architecture", "performance", "security"] |
| `problem_context` | string | Background and constraints |
| `relevant_files` | list | Key files (absolute paths) |
| `files_checked` | list | All files examined |
| `issues_found` | list | Problems with severity |
| `continuation_id` | string | Continue session |
| `thinking_mode` | enum | minimal/low/medium/high/max |

## Investigation Process

```
Step 1: Define problem and scope
        ↓
Step 2: Gather evidence, form hypotheses
        ↓
Step 3: Test hypotheses with data
        ↓
Step 4: Refine or pivot based on evidence
        ↓
Step N: Reach conclusion with confidence
```

## Confidence Progression

| Level | Evidence | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `exploring` | None yet | Gather data |
| `low` | Initial clues | Form hypothesis |
| `medium` | Supporting evidence | Test hypothesis |
| `high` | Strong evidence | Verify conclusion |
| `very_high` | Confirmed | Document findings |
| `certain` | Proven | Skip validation |

## Example: Architecture Decision

```python
# Step 1: Frame the problem
mcp__pal__thinkdeep(
    step="Should we adopt event sourcing for the order system?",
    step_number=1,
    total_steps=4,
    next_step_required=True,
    findings="""
    Current state:
    - CRUD-based order management
    - 50K orders/day, growing 20%/month
    - Audit trail requirements from compliance
    - Complex order lifecycle (10 states)

    Questions to investigate:
    - Performance implications at scale
    - Team learning curve
    - Migration complexity
    - Operational overhead
    """,
    problem_context="Evaluating event sourcing vs enhanced CRUD",
    focus_areas=["architecture", "scalability", "complexity"],
    hypothesis="Event sourcing may be over-engineering for current scale",
    confidence="exploring"
)

# Step 2: Analyze trade-offs
mcp__pal__thinkdeep(
    step="Analyzing event sourcing trade-offs for our context",
    step_number=2,
    total_steps=4,
    next_step_required=True,
    findings="""
    Evidence gathered:

    FOR event sourcing:
    - Built-in audit trail (compliance requirement)
    - Temporal queries for analytics
    - Replay capability for debugging

    AGAINST event sourcing:
    - Team has no ES experience (3-6 month learning)
    - Infrastructure complexity (event store, projections)
    - 50K orders/day is manageable with CRUD + audit table

    Middle ground discovered:
    - Audit table with change tracking gives 80% of benefits
    - Can evolve to ES later if needed
    """,
    problem_context="Weighing complexity vs benefits",
    hypothesis="Audit table + CDC is sufficient for current needs",
    confidence="medium",
    continuation_id=result["continuation_id"]
)
```

## Focus Area Guidelines

### Architecture
- System boundaries and responsibilities
- Data flow and dependencies
- Coupling and cohesion
- Scalability patterns

### Performance
- Bottleneck identification
- Resource utilization
- Query optimization
- Caching strategies

### Security
- Attack surface analysis
- Data protection
- Authentication/authorization
- Compliance requirements

## Best Practices

1. **Start with questions** - What do we need to learn?
2. **Gather evidence first** - Don't jump to conclusions
3. **Consider alternatives** - Challenge your assumptions
4. **Document reasoning** - Future you will thank you
5. **Update confidence honestly** - Uncertainty is information
6. **Use continuation_id** - Preserve context across steps
