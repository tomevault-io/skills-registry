description: Git and GitHub operations via gh CLI — branching, committing, creating PRs, managing issues, viewing CI status, and repository management. Provides ready-to-use gh commands for common workflows like creating feature branches, checking PR review status, listing open issues, viewing workflow run results, and managing labels. Use when doing git operations, creating or updating PRs, managing GitHub issues, checking CI/CD status, viewing PR comments, or working with GitHub releases. Triggers on 'git', 'github', 'PR', 'pull request', 'issue', 'branch', 'CI status', 'gh'. NOT for: Linear issue tracking (use linear), AI code reviews (use coderabbit), full PR lifecycle with review loops (use pr-loop). Use when this capability is needed.

# Skill: GitHub & Git Operations

> Use `gh` CLI and git commands through this skill. No GitHub MCP required.

## Prerequisites
- `gh` CLI installed (`brew install gh`)
- Authenticated: `gh auth login`

---

## Quick Reference

### Issues
```bash
# Create issue
gh issue create --title "Title" --body "Description" --label "bug"

# List issues
gh issue list
gh issue list --assignee @me
gh issue list --label "enhancement"

# View issue
gh issue view 123

# Close issue
gh issue close 123
```

### Pull Requests
```bash
# Create PR (from current branch)
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"

# Create PR with template
gh pr create --title "feat: add feature" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Change 1
- Change 2

## Test plan
- [ ] Test A
- [ ] Test B
EOF
)"

# List PRs
gh pr list
gh pr list --author @me

# View PR
gh pr view 123

# Checkout PR locally
gh pr checkout 123

# Merge PR
gh pr merge 123 --squash
```

### Commits (Git)
```bash
# Stage specific files (preferred over git add -A)
git add file1.ts file2.ts

# Commit with co-author
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: description of change

EOF
)"

# Check status
git status

# View diff
git diff
git diff --staged
```

### Branches
```bash
# Create and switch
git checkout -b feat/new-feature

# Push with upstream
git push -u origin feat/new-feature

# Delete branch (after merge)
git branch -d feat/old-feature
```

### Worktrees (Isolated Development)

Worktrees create isolated workspaces sharing the same repo — work on multiple branches simultaneously.

**Directory selection (priority order):**
1. Check for existing `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/` dir
2. Check CLAUDE.md for preference
3. Ask user: `.worktrees/` (project-local, hidden) or `~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/<project>/` (global)

**Safety:** For project-local dirs, verify they're gitignored first:
```bash
git check-ignore -q .worktrees 2>/dev/null
# If NOT ignored: add to .gitignore + commit before proceeding
```

**Create + setup:**
```bash
# Create worktree with new branch
git worktree add .worktrees/feature-name -b feat/feature-name
cd .worktrees/feature-name

# Auto-detect and run project setup
[ -f package.json ] && npm install
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && cargo build
[ -f requirements.txt ] && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify clean baseline
npm test  # or appropriate test command

# List worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove worktree (after merge/discard)
git worktree remove .worktrees/feature-name
```

---

## Common Workflows

### Start New Feature
```bash
git checkout -b feat/feature-name
# ... make changes ...
git add changed-files.ts
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
git push -u origin feat/feature-name
gh pr create --title "feat: add feature" --body "Description"
```

### Fix a Bug from Issue
```bash
# View the issue first
gh issue view 42

# Create branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-42

# ... fix the bug ...
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue #42"
git push -u origin fix/issue-42
gh pr create --title "fix: resolve issue #42" --body "Closes #42"
```

### Create Issue for Future Work
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "feat: future enhancement" \
  --body "## Description
What needs to be done.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2" \
  --label "enhancement"
```

---

## Safety Rules

1. **Never force push to main/master** - Always create feature branches
2. **Stage specific files** - Avoid `git add -A` which can include secrets
3. **Check before commit** - Run `git status` and `git diff --staged`
4. **Don't commit secrets** - Check for .env, credentials, API keys
5. **Ask before destructive operations** - reset --hard, branch -D, etc.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Auth Issues - GITHUB_TOKEN Conflict (Common!)

**Symptom:** `gh` commands fail with "Bad credentials" even though `gh auth status` shows you're logged in.

**Cause:** An old/expired `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your shell config (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`) overrides the valid keyring auth.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
gh auth status
# Look for: "The token in GITHUB_TOKEN is invalid"
# And: "Active account: false" even though logged in
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# 1. Find where GITHUB_TOKEN is set
grep -r "GITHUB_TOKEN" ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc ~/.zprofile 2>/dev/null

# 2. Remove that line from your shell config (or comment it out)
# The gh CLI uses keyring auth now which is better (auto-refreshes)

# 3. Unset in current session
unset GITHUB_TOKEN

# 4. Verify it works
gh auth status  # Should show "Active account: true"
```

**Why this happens:** Old GitHub workflows used personal access tokens exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The `gh` CLI now uses OAuth via keyring, which is more secure and auto-refreshes. The old env var takes precedence and breaks things.

### Re-authenticate
```bash
gh auth login
```

### Push Rejected
```bash
# Fetch and rebase
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Then push
git push
```
