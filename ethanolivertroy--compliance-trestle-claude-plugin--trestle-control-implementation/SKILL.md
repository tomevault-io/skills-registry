# Control Implementation in Trestle

## Writing Control Responses

### SSP Control Markdown Structure

Each control markdown file in an SSP has this structure:

```markdown
---
x-trestle-set-params:
  ac-1_prm_1:
    values:
      - organization-defined value
    ssp-values:
      - actual SSP value
x-trestle-comp-def-rules:
  My Component:
    - name: rule-ac-1
      description: Ensure access control policy exists
x-trestle-comp-def-rules-param-vals:
  My Component:
    - name: rule-param-1
      values:
        - default value
      ssp-values:
        - SSP override value
---

# ac-1 - [Access Control] Policy and Procedures

## Control Statement
[Control statement text with {{ insert: param, ac-1_prm_1 }} placeholders]

## Control guidance
[Guidance text]

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation for part a.

### My Component

<!-- Add control implementation description here for part a. -->
Implementation prose for component addressing part a.

#### Rules:
  - rule-ac-1

#### Implementation Status: implemented

### This System

<!-- Add control implementation description here for part a. -->
Implementation prose for the overall system addressing part a.

#### Implementation Status: partial
```

## Component-Level Responses

Each control statement part gets responses from each component:

1. **Named Components** (from component-definitions): Have rules, parameters, status
2. **This System** component: Overall system-level response (always present)

### Adding Implementation Prose
Replace the HTML comment placeholders with actual implementation text:
```markdown
### My Component
This component implements access control policy by...
```

## Rules and Parameters

### Rules
Rules come from component definitions and are **read-only** in SSP markdown:
```yaml
x-trestle-comp-def-rules:
  Component Name:
    - name: rule-id
      description: What the rule checks
```

### Rule Parameters
Parameters for rules can have values overridden in SSP:
```yaml
x-trestle-comp-def-rules-param-vals:
  Component Name:
    - name: param-name
      values:
        - component default
      ssp-values:
        - SSP override
```

## Implementation Status

Set per-component using these values:
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `implemented` | Fully implemented |
| `partial` | Partially implemented |
| `planned` | Implementation planned |
| `alternative` | Alternative implementation exists |
| `not-applicable` | Not applicable to this component |

In markdown: `#### Implementation Status: implemented`

## Inheritance and Leveraged SSPs

### Leveraged SSPs
When a system inherits controls from a provider:

```markdown
## This System: Component Name

### Provided Statement Description
Description of what the provider system provides.

### Responsibility Statement Description
Description of customer responsibilities.

### Satisfied Statement Description
How the inheriting system satisfies its responsibilities.
```

### Control Origination
Tracks where control implementation comes from:
- `organization` - Organization-wide policy/procedure
- `system-specific` - Specific to this system
- `customer-configured` - Customer configures provider capability
- `customer-provided` - Customer provides the implementation
- `inherited` - Inherited from provider system

## Profile-Level Control Additions

Profiles can add sections to controls:
```yaml
x-trestle-sections:
  guidance: Guidance
  implgdn: Implementation Guidance
  expevid: Expected Evidence
```

These sections appear in the markdown and can be edited:
```markdown
## Implementation Guidance
Organization-specific implementation guidance here.

## Expected Evidence
Evidence required to demonstrate implementation.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Reference actual system components, tools, and processes
2. **Address each part**: Ensure every statement part has a response
3. **Set parameters**: Replace `<REPLACE_ME>` placeholders with actual values
4. **Track status honestly**: Use `partial` or `planned` when appropriate
5. **Document inheritance**: Clearly describe what is inherited vs. locally implemented
6. **Use component definitions**: Define reusable compliance content in component-definitions
7. **Leverage CI/CD**: Use assemble in pipelines to validate changes automatically

## Worked Example: Writing AC-2 Account Management

### Before: Generated Markdown (Unfilled)

```markdown
---
x-trestle-set-params:
  ac-2_prm_1:
    values:
      - organization-defined account types
    ssp-values:
---

# ac-2 - Account Management

## Control Statement

...

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation for part a.

### Identity Provider

<!-- Add control implementation description here for part a. -->

#### Implementation Status: planned

### This System

<!-- Add control implementation description here for part a. -->

#### Implementation Status: planned
```

### After: Filled-In Implementation

```markdown
---
x-trestle-set-params:
  ac-2_prm_1:
    values:
      - organization-defined account types
    ssp-values:
      - privileged, non-privileged, system, service, and temporary accounts
---

# ac-2 - Account Management

## Control Statement

...

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation for part a.

### Identity Provider

The Identity Provider (IdP) manages all user account types including privileged,
non-privileged, and service accounts. Account provisioning is handled through
the IdP's administrative console with SCIM integration to downstream systems.

#### Rules:
  - rule-ac-2-account-types

#### Implementation Status: implemented

### This System

The system integrates with the organization's Identity Provider for account
lifecycle management. Local service accounts are managed through
infrastructure-as-code templates with mandatory approval workflows.

#### Implementation Status: implemented

## Implementation for part b.

### Identity Provider

Account managers are designated through the IdP's delegation model. Each
organizational unit has a primary and backup account manager assigned in the
IdP administrative hierarchy.

#### Implementation Status: implemented

### This System

System-level account managers are documented in the System Security Plan
Appendix A and are drawn from the operations team as designated by the ISSO.

#### Implementation Status: implemented
```

## Parameter Precedence

Parameter values flow through three levels, with each level able to override the previous:

| Level | Field | Source | Purpose |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Catalog | `values` | Catalog parameter definition | Default/suggested value |
| 2. Profile | `profile-values` | Profile `set-parameters` | Baseline-specific tailoring |
| 3. SSP | `ssp-values` | SSP control markdown header | System-specific implementation value |

**The SSP-level `ssp-values` always wins.** If `ssp-values` is set, it overrides both `profile-values` and catalog `values`. If `ssp-values` is empty, the profile value is used. If the profile doesn't set a value, the catalog default applies.

Example showing the same parameter at all three levels:
```yaml
# Catalog defines: ac-1_prm_1 values: ["organization-defined frequency"]
# Profile sets: profile-values: ["annually"]
# SSP overrides:
x-trestle-set-params:
  ac-1_prm_1:
    values:
      - organization-defined frequency
    profile-values:
      - annually
    ssp-values:
      - at least every 365 days or upon policy change
```

In the assembled SSP, the resolved value is `at least every 365 days or upon policy change`.

## Handling Multi-Part Controls

OSCAL controls often have statement parts (a, b, c...) and sometimes sub-parts (a.1, a.2). Each maps to a specific markdown structure.

### Statement Parts

Each lettered part gets its own `## Implementation for part X.` heading:
```markdown
## Implementation for part a.
### My Component
[Response for part a]

## Implementation for part b.
### My Component
[Response for part b]
```

### Sub-Parts

Nested sub-parts use extended identifiers:
```markdown
## Implementation for part a.1.
### My Component
[Response for sub-part a.1]
```

### Which Parts Need Responses

- **Every statement part must have a response** for each component — even if only to say the part is not applicable to that component
- Control statement text, guidance, and objective sections are **informational** and should not be edited
- Only the sections below the horizontal rule (`______________________________________________________________________`) accept implementation prose

## Compensating Controls

When a control requirement cannot be met as stated, document a compensating control:

1. **Set implementation status to `alternative`**:
   ```markdown
   #### Implementation Status: alternative
   ```

2. **Describe the compensating control** in the implementation prose:
   ```markdown
   ### This System
   The system cannot implement centralized session termination as specified
   due to architectural constraints in the legacy middleware layer. As a
   compensating control, the system enforces aggressive idle timeouts
   (15 minutes) at the application layer and requires re-authentication
   for all privileged operations. This compensating control was approved
   by the AO on 2024-06-15 (see POA&M item PM-2024-042).
   ```

3. **Reference the POA&M entry** if one exists for tracking the gap

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Leaving `<!-- Add control implementation -->` comments | Assemble silently includes them as empty content — auditors see blank responses | Replace every placeholder with actual prose or remove it |
| Wrong YAML indentation in headers | Assemble fails with a YAML parse error | Use 2-space indentation consistently, never tabs |
| Missing `ssp-values` when values are required | Parameters resolve to catalog defaults which may be vague placeholders | Set explicit `ssp-values` for every parameter |
| Writing generic responses like "The system implements this control" | Fails ATO review — assessors need specific detail | Reference specific tools, processes, configurations, and responsible roles |
| Not addressing every statement part separately | Assemble may silently drop unaddressed parts | Add a response (even "Not applicable to this component") for each part per component |
| Confusing `values` vs `ssp-values` | Assembled SSP uses the wrong parameter value | `values` = catalog default; `ssp-values` = what this system actually uses |
| Editing content above the horizontal rule | Changes are overwritten on the next generate | Only edit content below the `______________________________________________________________________` divider |

## Where Rules Come From

Rules that appear in SSP markdown (under `x-trestle-comp-def-rules`) originate from the
component definition authoring supply chain — they are **not authored in the SSP**.

### The Rules Supply Chain

```
CSV spreadsheet (vendor-authored rules, parameters, control mappings)
    --> trestle task csv-to-oscal-cd (produces component-definition JSON)
        --> trestle author component-generate (produces component markdown with rules + editable prose)
            --> Edit markdown: write implementation responses
                --> trestle author component-assemble (merges prose into component-definition JSON)
                    --> trestle author ssp-generate --compdefs ... (pulls rules into SSP markdown)
```

### Rules Are Read-Only in SSP Markdown

The rules section in SSP control markdown is populated from component definitions during
`ssp-generate`. Editing rules directly in SSP markdown has no effect — they will be
overwritten on the next `ssp-generate` run.

**To change a rule**: Edit the source component definition (CSV or component markdown),
reassemble it, then regenerate the SSP.

### To Add New Rules

1. Add the rule to the component definition CSV
2. Run `trestle task csv-to-oscal-cd` to rebuild the component definition
3. Run `trestle author component-generate` and write the prose response
4. Run `trestle author component-assemble`
5. Run `trestle author ssp-generate` to pull the new rule into SSP markdown
