## Common Tasks

### Find controls for a specific topic
1. Identify the relevant control family from the table above
2. Load the family reference file (e.g., `references/800-53/ac.md` for Access Control)
3. Search for the specific control by ID or keyword

### Compare FedRAMP baselines
1. Load `references/cross-references/baselines.md`
2. Look up Low, Moderate, or High baseline control selections
3. Cross-reference with specific control family files for details

### Map 800-53 controls to CSF
1. Load `references/cross-references/800-53-to-csf.md`
2. Find the CSF function/category of interest
3. See which 800-53 controls implement that category

### Map 800-53 to 800-171
1. Load `references/cross-references/800-53-to-800-171.md`
2. Find the 800-53 control of interest
3. See the corresponding 800-171 requirement (if any)

### Look up related controls
1. Load the family reference file (e.g., `references/800-53/ac.md`)
2. Each non-withdrawn control has a `**Related Controls:**` line listing cross-references
3. These are sourced from the authoritative NIST OSCAL catalog

### Check baseline applicability
1. Each non-withdrawn control has a `**Baselines:**` line showing Low, Moderate, and/or High
2. For a full listing: `python scripts/lookup.py baseline moderate` (or `low`, `high`)
3. Filter by family: `python scripts/lookup.py baseline moderate AC`
4. See also `references/cross-references/baselines.md` for FedRAMP details

### Map CSF 2.0 to 800-53 controls
1. By function: `python scripts/lookup.py map csf PR` (shows all Protect mappings)
2. By category: `python scripts/lookup.py map csf PR.AA` (shows specific category)
3. Or load `references/cross-references/800-53-to-csf.md` directly

### Look up assessment procedures
1. Identify the control from 800-53
2. Load the corresponding family file under `references/800-53a/`
3. Find the assessment objectives and methods

### Understand a NIST term
1. Load `references/glossary.md`
2. Search for the term alphabetically

## Usage Notes

- **Control IDs** follow the pattern: `{FAMILY}-{NUMBER}` (e.g., AC-2, SI-4)
- **Enhancements** append a parenthetical: `AC-2(1)`, `SI-4(5)`
- **Baselines**: Low ⊂ Moderate ⊂ High (each higher baseline includes all controls from lower ones). Each control in 800-53 files has a `**Baselines:**` tag showing which baselines include it.
- **Related Controls**: Every non-withdrawn control has a `**Related Controls:**` line sourced from the NIST OSCAL catalog.
- **800-171** requirements map to a subset of 800-53 Moderate baseline controls
- **CSF categories** use dot notation: `GV.OC-01`, `PR.AC-01`
- **OSCAL** (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) provides machine-readable versions of these frameworks

## Data Sources

Reference content is derived from:
- **Dataset**: `ethanolivertroy/nist-cybersecurity-training` (530,912 structured examples from 596 NIST publications)
- **Raw PDFs**: `ethanolivertroy/nist-publications-raw` (596 PDFs, 2 GB)
- **NIST OSCAL**: Official machine-readable catalogs for 800-53, 800-171, and FedRAMP baselines
