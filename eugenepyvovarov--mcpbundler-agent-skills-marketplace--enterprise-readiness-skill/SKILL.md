---

## MANDATORY Requirements

**CRITICAL: The following are NOT optional. Every project MUST have ALL of these. Do not skip any.**

### README Badges (MANDATORY)

Every project README.md MUST display these badges at the top, in this order:

```markdown
<!-- Row 1: CI/Quality -->
[![CI](https://github.com/ORG/REPO/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ORG/REPO/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ORG/REPO/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ORG/REPO)

<!-- Row 2: Security (MANDATORY) -->
[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/ORG/REPO/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/ORG/REPO)
[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/PROJECT_ID/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/PROJECT_ID)
```

| Badge | URL Pattern | MANDATORY |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| CI Status | `github.com/ORG/REPO/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg` | **YES** |
| Codecov | `codecov.io/gh/ORG/REPO/graph/badge.svg` | **YES** |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | `api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/ORG/REPO/badge` | **YES** |
| OpenSSF Best Practices | `www.bestpractices.dev/projects/PROJECT_ID/badge` | **YES** |

### CI/CD Workflows (MANDATORY)

Every GitHub project MUST have these workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | File | Purpose | MANDATORY |
|----------|------|---------|-----------|
| CI | `ci.yml` | Build, test, lint | **YES** |
| CodeQL | `codeql.yml` | Security scanning | **YES** |
| Scorecard | `scorecard.yml` | OpenSSF Scorecard | **YES** |
| Dependency Review | `dependency-review.yml` | PR CVE check | **YES** |

### CI Must Include (MANDATORY)

| Requirement | Implementation | MANDATORY |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Coverage upload | `codecov/codecov-action` after tests | **YES** |
| Security audit | `composer audit` / `npm audit` / `govulncheck` | **YES** |
| SHA-pinned actions | All actions use full SHA with version comment | **YES** |

### Supply Chain Security (MANDATORY for Releases)

**Supply chain security controls MUST block releases when violated.**

| Control | Implementation | Blocks Release? |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| SLSA Provenance | `slsa-github-generator` workflow | **YES** - no release without attestation |
| Signed Tags | `git tag -s` before `gh release create` | **YES** - unsigned tags rejected |
| SBOM Generation | `anchore/sbom-action` or `cyclonedx` | **YES** - SBOM required for compliance |
| Dependency Audit | `composer audit` / `npm audit` fails CI | **YES** - CVEs block merge |

#### Release Workflow Order (MANDATORY)

Supply chain artifacts MUST be generated in this order:

```
1. CI passes (tests, lint, security audit)
     ↓
2. Create SIGNED tag locally: git tag -s vX.Y.Z
     ↓
3. Push signed tag: git push origin vX.Y.Z
     ↓
4. Create release on existing tag: gh release create vX.Y.Z
     ↓
5. SLSA provenance workflow triggers (workflow_run)
     ↓
6. Provenance attestation uploaded to release
     ↓
7. SBOM generated and uploaded
```

**NEVER** use `gh release create` without a pre-existing signed tag - this creates unsigned tags.

#### CI Integration for Supply Chain

Add to `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
# Pre-release checks (block release if failed)
- name: Security Audit
  run: |
    composer audit --format=plain || exit 1
    npm audit --audit-level=high || exit 1

# SBOM generation
- name: Generate SBOM
  uses: anchore/sbom-action@v0
  with:
    artifact-name: sbom.spdx.json
    output-file: sbom.spdx.json

- name: Upload SBOM to release
  run: gh release upload ${{ github.ref_name }} sbom.spdx.json
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

#### Verification of Supply Chain Artifacts

Before announcing a release, verify:

- [ ] Release tag is GPG/SSH signed: `git tag -v vX.Y.Z`
- [ ] SLSA provenance exists: `multiple.intoto.jsonl` in release assets
- [ ] SBOM exists: `sbom.spdx.json` or `sbom.cyclonedx.json` in release assets
- [ ] No HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs: `composer audit` / `npm audit` clean

See `references/slsa-provenance.md` for detailed SLSA implementation guide.

### OpenSSF Registration (MANDATORY)

1. **Register at bestpractices.dev**: https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/new
2. **Note the Project ID** assigned after registration
3. **Add badge to README** with correct PROJECT_ID
4. **Run Scorecard workflow** to generate initial score

### Codecov Setup (MANDATORY)

1. **Enable Codecov** for the repository at codecov.io
2. **Collect coverage from ALL test suites** (not just unit tests):

| Test Suite | Coverage Command | Output File | MANDATORY |
|------------|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Unit | `phpunit -c UnitTests.xml --coverage-clover` | `.Build/coverage/unit.xml` | **YES** |
| Integration | `phpunit -c IntegrationTests.xml --coverage-clover` | `.Build/coverage/integration.xml` | **YES** |
| E2E | `phpunit -c E2ETests.xml --coverage-clover` | `.Build/coverage/e2e.xml` | **YES** |
| Functional | `phpunit -c FunctionalTests.xml --coverage-clover` | `.Build/coverage/functional.xml` | **YES** |
| JavaScript | `npm run test:coverage` | `coverage/lcov.info` | **YES** (if JS exists) |

3. **Upload ALL coverage files** to Codecov:
   ```yaml
   - uses: codecov/codecov-action@SHA # vX.Y.Z
     with:
       token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}  # MANDATORY - see below
       files: .Build/coverage/unit.xml,.Build/coverage/integration.xml,.Build/coverage/e2e.xml,coverage/lcov.info
       fail_ci_if_error: false
   ```

### CODECOV_TOKEN (MANDATORY)

**Never rely on tokenless uploads.** They fail for protected branches and are unreliable.

| Requirement | Implementation | Why |
|-------------|----------------|-----|
| Token in secrets | Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` to repo or org secrets | Authentication |
| Token in workflow | `token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}` | Required for protected branches |
| Org-level secret | Preferred for consistency across repos | Single point of management |

**Failure without token:**
```
Upload failed: {"message":"Token required because branch is protected"}
```

**Get token from:** https://app.codecov.io/gh/ORG/REPO/settings

**Add as org secret (recommended):**
```bash
# Organization-level (covers all repos)
gh secret set CODECOV_TOKEN --org netresearch --visibility all

# Or repository-level
gh secret set CODECOV_TOKEN --repo OWNER/REPO
```

### JavaScript Coverage (MANDATORY for projects with JS/TS)

When a project contains JavaScript or TypeScript files:

1. **vitest.config.js** MUST include lcov reporter for Codecov:
   ```javascript
   coverage: {
       provider: 'v8',
       reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html', 'lcov'],  // lcov REQUIRED for Codecov
       reportsDirectory: 'coverage',
   }
   ```

2. **CI workflow** MUST include JavaScript test job:
   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/setup-node@SHA # vX.Y.Z
     with:
       node-version: '22'
   - run: npm install
   - run: npm run test:coverage
   ```

3. **Codecov upload** MUST include `coverage/lcov.info`

### Verification Checklist

Before marking enterprise-readiness complete, verify ALL:

- [ ] README has CI badge linking to workflow
- [ ] README has Codecov badge (not "unknown")
- [ ] README has OpenSSF Scorecard badge (correct URL with `api.securityscorecards.dev`)
- [ ] README has OpenSSF Best Practices badge (correct PROJECT_ID, not placeholder)
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists and uploads coverage
- [ ] `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` exists
- [ ] `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml` exists
- [ ] Codecov shows actual coverage percentage
- [ ] Scorecard shows actual score

**If any badge shows "unknown", "invalid", or placeholder ID - FIX IT. Do not proceed.**

## OpenSSF Scorecard Optimization Playbook

Proven playbook to raise OpenSSF Scorecard from ~6.8 to ~9.0. Applied successfully on [t3x-rte_ckeditor_image](https://github.com/netresearch/t3x-rte_ckeditor_image).

### Check-by-Check Guide

| Check | Quick Fix | Impact |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Token-Permissions | Move all `write` perms from workflow-level to job-level | 0→10 |
| Branch-Protection | Set `required_approving_review_count: 1` + auto-approve + protect release branches | 0→8 |
| Code-Review | Automatic after Branch-Protection fix | 5→10 |
| Security-Policy | Private vulnerability reporting + coordinated disclosure | 4→10 |
| Pinned-Dependencies | SHA-pin all actions (except SLSA generator — see below) | 8→10 |
| Fuzzing | Not practical for PHP/TYPO3 — skip | 0 (accept) |
| CII-Best-Practices | Complete questionnaire at bestpractices.dev | 2→6+ |

### Token-Permissions (0→10)

The scorecard flags ANY `write` permission at the **workflow-level**. Fix: declare `permissions: contents: read` (or `permissions: {}`) at workflow-level, move all `write` to job-level.

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT
permissions:
    contents: read

jobs:
    deploy:
        permissions:
            contents: write    # only this job gets write
        steps: ...

# ❌ WRONG — Scorecard flags this
permissions:
    contents: read
    pull-requests: write       # write at workflow level!
```

Common violators: `pr-quality.yml`, `release-labeler.yml`, `create-release.yml`.

### Branch-Protection (0→8) for Solo Maintainers

Solo-dev projects need `required_approving_review_count >= 1` but can't wait for human reviewers. Solution: auto-approve workflow + ruleset.

**Default branch ruleset:**

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/rulesets/RULESET_ID -X PUT --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "rules": [{
    "type": "pull_request",
    "parameters": {
      "required_approving_review_count": 1,
      "dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push": true,
      "require_code_owner_review": false,
      "require_last_push_approval": true,
      "required_review_thread_resolution": true
    }
  }]
}
EOF
```

**Release branch ruleset** (e.g., `TYPO3_*`, `release/*`):

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/rulesets -X POST --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "name": "release-branches",
  "enforcement": "active",
  "target": "branch",
  "conditions": {"ref_name": {"include": ["refs/heads/TYPO3_*"], "exclude": []}},
  "rules": [
    {"type": "deletion"},
    {"type": "non_fast_forward"},
    {"type": "pull_request", "parameters": {
      "required_approving_review_count": 1,
      "dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push": true,
      "require_code_owner_review": false,
      "require_last_push_approval": true,
      "required_review_thread_resolution": true,
      "allowed_merge_methods": ["merge"]
    }},
    {"type": "required_status_checks", "parameters": {
      "required_status_checks": [{"context": "Build ✓", "integration_id": 15368}],
      "strict_required_status_checks_policy": true
    }}
  ]
}
EOF
```

Also enable `enforce_admins` via legacy API (scorecard reads this separately from rulesets):

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/branches/main/protection/enforce_admins -X POST
```

Pair with `pr-quality.yml` auto-approve workflow (see `github-project` skill) that approves non-fork PRs via `github-actions[bot]`.

**Codeowner review incompatibility:** `require_code_owner_review: true` is **incompatible** with bot auto-approve workflows. `github-actions[bot]` (GITHUB_TOKEN) is not a codeowner — its APPROVED review does not satisfy the codeowner requirement, permanently blocking all PRs. Verified on [t3x-rte_ckeditor_image#629](https://github.com/netresearch/t3x-rte_ckeditor_image/pull/629). Keep this `false` when using auto-approve.

**Unresolved review threads:** `required_review_thread_resolution: true` will block merge if automated reviewers (Gemini Code Assist, Copilot) leave unresolved threads. Resolve via:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "PRRT_xxx"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'
```

**Remaining scorecard warnings (unfixable for solo maintainer):**
- `required approving review count is 1` — scorecard wants >= 2, impractical without human reviewers
- `codeowners review is not required` — incompatible with bot auto-approve (see above)

### Security-Policy (4→10)

The scorecard requires SECURITY.md with:
1. **Link to private reporting mechanism** (not public issues!)
2. **Response timeline** (e.g., 48h acknowledgment, 7d fix)
3. **Coordinated disclosure process**

Template:
```markdown
## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/ORG/REPO/security/advisories/new).

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix
within 7 days for critical vulnerabilities.

## Coordinated Disclosure

After a fix is released, we will:
1. Publish a GitHub Security Advisory
2. Credit the reporter (unless anonymity is requested)
3. Include the fix in the next release with a CVE identifier if applicable
```

Enable private vulnerability reporting:
```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/private-vulnerability-reporting -X PUT
```

### SLSA Generator Pinning Exception

The `slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator` reusable workflow **cannot be SHA-pinned**. It MUST use `@vX.Y.Z` tags — the slsa-verifier needs the tag to verify trusted builder identity. This is a known GitHub Actions limitation tracked as [slsa-verifier#12](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/issues/12).

Accept this as an unavoidable Pinned-Dependencies gap (score stays at 8, not 10).

### Checks Not Worth Fixing

| Check | Why Skip |
|-------|----------|
| Fuzzing (0) | OSS-Fuzz doesn't support PHP/TYPO3; ROI too low |
| Packaging (-1) | TER publishing isn't detected as a packaging workflow |
| Signed-Releases (-1) | Detection issue — SLSA provenance exists but isn't recognized |

## Assessment Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Identify platform (GitHub/GitLab), languages, existing CI/CD
2. **Scoring**: Apply checklists from references based on stack
3. **Badge Assessment**: Check OpenSSF criteria status
4. **Gap Analysis**: List missing controls by severity
5. **Implementation**: Apply fixes using scripts and templates
6. **Verification**: Re-score and compare (see Post-Implementation Verification)

---

## Post-Implementation Verification

**MANDATORY:** After implementing improvements, re-assess the project to verify gains.

### Re-Scoring Workflow

1. **Record baseline score** before making changes (save output)
2. **Implement improvements** following gap analysis priorities
3. **Re-run full assessment** using same criteria
4. **Compare scores** and document delta

### Verification Checklist

| Check | Before | After | Delta |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| OpenSSF Scorecard | _/10 | _/10 | +_ |
| Best Practices Badge | Level | Level | Upgrade? |
| Coverage % | _% | _% | +_% |
| Enterprise Score | _/100 | _/100 | +_ |

### Expected Outcomes

| Implementation | Expected Score Impact |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Add CI/CD workflows | +10-15 pts |
| Enable Codecov | +5-10 pts |
| Add CodeQL/Scorecard | +10-15 pts |
| SLSA provenance | +5-10 pts |
| Documentation (SECURITY.md, etc.) | +5-10 pts |

### Verification Commands

```bash
# OpenSSF Scorecard (re-run after changes merged to default branch)
scorecard --repo=github.com/ORG/REPO --format=json

# Coverage (after CI runs)
# Check Codecov dashboard or badge

# Best Practices (update at bestpractices.dev after implementing)
# Re-answer questions that are now satisfied
```

**If score did not improve as expected**, investigate:
- Did CI workflows run successfully?
- Are badges pointing to correct repository?
- Did changes merge to default branch (required for Scorecard)?

---

## Continuous Improvement

Enterprise readiness is not a one-time achievement. Maintain scores over time.

### Scheduled Re-Assessment

| Frequency | Scope | Trigger |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Weekly** | Badge status check | Automated (CI) |
| **Monthly** | Scorecard re-run | Scheduled workflow |
| **Quarterly** | Full enterprise assessment | Manual or milestone |
| **Per-release** | Supply chain verification | Release workflow |

### Automated Monitoring

Add badge health check to CI:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/badge-health.yml
name: Badge Health Check
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * 1'  # Weekly Monday 6am
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check-badges:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check Codecov
        run: |
          BADGE_URL="https://codecov.io/gh/${{ github.repository }}/graph/badge.svg"
          curl -sL "$BADGE_URL" | grep -q "unknown" && echo "::warning::Codecov badge shows unknown" || true

      - name: Check Scorecard
        run: |
          SCORE=$(curl -s "https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/${{ github.repository }}" | jq -r '.score // "N/A"')
          echo "Current Scorecard: $SCORE/10"
          if [ "$SCORE" != "N/A" ] && [ "$(echo "$SCORE < 7" | bc -l)" = "1" ]; then
            echo "::warning::Scorecard dropped below 7.0"
          fi
```

### Regression Detection

Watch for these warning signs:

| Signal | Detection | Response |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Scorecard drop > 1pt | Weekly check | Investigate changed checks |
| Badge shows "unknown" | CI check | Verify token/configuration |
| CVE in dependency | Dependabot/Renovate | Priority update PR |
| Failed security scan | CI workflow | Block release until fixed |
| Coverage drop > 5% | PR check | Require coverage recovery |

### Dependency Update Cadence

| Update Type | Frequency | Automation |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Security patches | Immediate | Auto-merge if tests pass |
| Minor updates | Weekly | Renovate/Dependabot PR |
| Major updates | Monthly review | Manual approval required |

## Dependency CVE Workflow

When assessing enterprise readiness, **always run dependency audit** as part of discovery:

```bash
# PHP/Composer
composer audit

# Node.js
npm audit

# Python
pip-audit

# Go
govulncheck ./...
```

### CVE Handling Best Practice

**Separate dependency updates from code changes:**

| PR Type | Content | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Code changes | Business logic, bug fixes, features | Reviewable, testable in isolation |
| Dependency updates | `composer update`, version bumps | Clear diff, easy rollback if issues |

**Real-world example from t3x-cowriter review:**
- Found 4 CVEs during enterprise assessment
- CVE fixes required `composer update typo3/cms-core typo3/cms-backend`
- Kept separate from code fixes (JS bug, AGENTS.md updates) for clean PR history

### CVE Severity Response

| Severity | Response Time | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Immediate | Hotfix PR, expedited review |
| HIGH | 24-48 hours | Priority PR, security review |
| MEDIUM | 1 week | Normal PR cycle |
| LOW | Next release | Batch with other updates |

### CI Integration

Add dependency audit to CI pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Security audit
  run: composer audit --format=plain
```

## Code Review Quick Checklist

Before approving PRs, verify (see `references/code-review.md` for details):

- [ ] **One resource per test** - No duplicate instances
- [ ] **State mutation complete** - Tracking fields updated after operations
- [ ] **Defensive enum handling** - `Valid()` method, `default` case, tested
- [ ] **Documentation accurate** - Claims match benchmarks, trade-offs noted
- [ ] **Platform code marked** - Limitations documented, alternatives provided
- [ ] **Defensive code tested** - Error paths and edge cases covered

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER** interpolate `${{ github.event.* }}` in `run:` blocks (script injection)
- **NEVER** guess action versions - always fetch from GitHub API
- **ALWAYS** use SHA pins for actions with version comments
- **ALWAYS** verify commit hashes against official tags
