description: Transform project descriptions and feature requests into comprehensive specifications and actionable task lists. Use when the user wants to: (1) Create a specification from a project/feature description, (2) Generate a detailed plan with task breakdown, (3) Clarify requirements before implementation, (4) Convert ideas into structured development plans with progress tracking. Works with or without existing codebase files. Use when this capability is needed.

# Spec-to-Plan Skill

This skill guides the process of transforming project descriptions into clear specifications and actionable task lists for developers.

## Process Overview

The skill follows a five-phase workflow:

1. **Create Initial Specification** - Analyze the feature/project description
2. **Clarify Questions** - Identify and resolve all ambiguities
3. **Generate Markdown Spec** - Produce detailed specification document (presented as `spec.md` in chat)
4. **Create Comprehensive Todo** - Break down into implementable tasks
5. **Output Plan Markdown** - Generate final `plan.md` with progress tracking (presented in chat)

**Final deliverables:** Both specification and plan content are provided as markdown in the conversation.

## Phase 1: Initial Specification

Load the prompt template from `references/phase1_spec_prompt.md` and fill in the feature description provided by the user.

**Key principles:**
- If files are provided, analyze the codebase thoroughly
- If no files, work from the task description or ask for detailed project description
- Identify dependencies, structure, and integration points
- Note edge cases (within reason - ask about scope depth)
- List ALL unclear or ambiguous points

**Do NOT implement yet** - only analyze and prepare questions.

## Phase 2: Clarify Questions

Ask all clarification questions at once. After receiving answers:
- If more questions persist, ask them
- Continue until no ambiguities remain
- Do NOT assume any requirements beyond explicitly described details

**Scope control:**
- Ask the user about desired depth and scope when uncertain
- Avoid going overboard with edge cases unless specifically requested
- Focus on what's explicitly needed

## Phase 3: Generate Markdown Spec

After all questions are answered, create a comprehensive specification document and present it in the chat:

**Content requirements:**
- No specific template required (flexible format)
- Should be clear, detailed, and implementation-ready
- Include all decisions and clarifications from the Q&A phase
- Document the full feature/project specification

**Output:**
- Present the complete `spec.md` content directly in the chat
- Use a clear header to indicate this is the specification document

## Phase 4: Create Comprehensive Todo

Load the prompt template from `references/phase2_plan_prompt.md`.

Generate a detailed task breakdown that includes:
- Status tracking with emojis (🟩 Done, 🟨 In Progress, 🟥 To Do)
- Overall progress percentage at the top
- Confirmed decisions section
- Modular, minimal steps
- Important implementation details
- File-level changes (Add/Modify/Keep sections)
- Progress calculations

**Critical:** Do NOT add extra scope or unnecessary complexity beyond what was explicitly clarified.

## Phase 5: Output Plan Markdown

Create the final `plan.md` content and present it in the chat:

**Content requirements:**
- Clear structure following the template in `phase2_plan_prompt.md`
- Checkbox tasks with status emojis
- Dynamic progress tracking
- Implementation details section
- File changes section listing specific files and modifications needed

**Output:**
- Present the complete `plan.md` content directly in the chat
- Use a clear header to indicate this is the implementation plan

Both the specification and plan are provided as markdown content in the conversation.

## Workflow Tips

**When to analyze codebase:**
- If user provides files → analyze them thoroughly
- If no files → work from description or ask for project details

**Question iteration:**
- Ask comprehensive questions in each round
- Wait for all answers before proceeding
- Continue asking until complete clarity is achieved

**Scope management:**
- Always ask about desired depth when uncertain
- Keep steps elegant and minimal
- Ensure seamless integration with existing codebase

**Output quality:**
- Plans should lead to simple, elegant, minimal code
- No extra complexity beyond discussed requirements
- All steps should be modular and implementable
