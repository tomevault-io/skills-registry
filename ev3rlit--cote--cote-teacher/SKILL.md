# CoTe Teacher

## Overview

This skill automates the creation of structured learning materials for coding test (CoTe) algorithm and data structure patterns. When a user requests learning materials for a specific pattern or concept, this skill generates a comprehensive markdown document following a standardized template and automatically updates the project's README.md with a link to the new material.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests:
- Learning materials for algorithm patterns (e.g., "Create learning material for sliding window pattern")
- Concept explanations for data structures (e.g., "Explain hash table concept with examples")
- Study guides for specific problem-solving techniques (e.g., "Make a two-pointer technique guide")

**Trigger keywords**: 학습 자료, 패턴 정리, 개념 정리, 학습, 정리, learning material, pattern guide

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Request

Identify the algorithm/pattern/concept from the user's request:
- Sliding window (슬라이딩 윈도우)
- Two pointers (투 포인터)
- Hash table (해시 테이블)
- Dynamic programming (동적 계획법)
- DFS/BFS
- Greedy algorithm (그리디)
- Binary search (이진 탐색)
- etc.

### Step 2: Prepare the Environment

1. **Check/create _learning/ folder**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p _learning
   ```

2. **Determine the filename**:
   - Format: Korean pattern name with underscores
   - Example: `슬라이딩_윈도우.md`, `투_포인터.md`

### Step 3: Select Appropriate Template

**Template Selection Logic**: Automatically choose the best template based on the content type:

1. **visualization.md** - Use when the topic involves:
   - Graphs, trees, or complex data structures
   - Step-by-step visual progression
   - Keywords: "그래프", "트리", "탐색", "DFS", "BFS", "최단경로"

2. **mathematical.md** - Use when the topic requires:
   - Mathematical proofs or recurrence relations
   - Dynamic programming formulations
   - Complexity analysis with formal proofs
   - Keywords: "DP", "동적계획법", "조합", "증명", "점화식", "복잡도 분석"

3. **implementation.md** - Use when the topic focuses on:
   - Data structure implementation details
   - Class design and methods
   - Internal mechanics
   - Keywords: "구현", "자료구조", "힙", "세그먼트 트리", "Union-Find", "클래스"

4. **basic_pattern.md** - Use as default for:
   - Simple algorithmic patterns
   - Text-heavy concept explanations
   - Techniques without heavy visualization or math
   - Keywords: "슬라이딩 윈도우", "투 포인터", "그리디", "패턴"

**Decision Process**:
```
IF keywords match visualization criteria:
    → Use visualization.md

ELSE IF keywords match mathematical criteria:
    → Use mathematical.md

ELSE IF keywords match implementation criteria:
    → Use implementation.md

ELSE:
    → Use basic_pattern.md (default)
```

### Step 4: Generate Learning Material

1. **Read the selected template**: Load the appropriate template from `assets/`

2. **Create the learning document** at `_learning/[패턴명].md`

3. **Fill in the content** based on the template structure:
   - Use clear, educational Korean explanations
   - Include practical Python code examples
   - Reference real coding test problems
   - Add complexity analysis
   - Follow the template's specific sections

### Step 5: Update README.md

1. **Locate the section**: Find "## 고민 없이 풀는 방법은 없을까?" in the main README.md

2. **Add the link** following existing pattern:
   ```markdown
   ## 고민 없이 풀는 방법은 없을까?

   - [변수 및 함수 작명법](NAMING.md)
   - [문제 풀이 방법](SOLVING.md)
   - [슬라이딩 윈도우 패턴](_learning/슬라이딩_윈도우.md)
   ```

3. **Maintain alphabetical or logical ordering** if preferred

### Step 6: Confirm Completion

Inform the user:
- Location of the created file
- What was added to README.md
- Suggest reviewing and customizing the content as needed

## Notes

- Code examples should always be in Python as per project standards
- Maintain consistency with existing project structure and naming conventions
- Learning materials are separate from problem solutions - they focus on teaching concepts, not solving specific problems
