# Prometheus Analysis

## Overview

Prometheus is a time-series metrics collection and alerting system widely used for monitoring production systems. This skill provides guidance for querying Prometheus metrics, interpreting alert data, and using metrics for root cause analysis.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply this skill when:
- Analyzing Prometheus alerts that have fired
- Querying metrics to understand system behavior
- Investigating metric anomalies or spikes
- Correlating metrics with incidents
- Writing PromQL queries for specific metrics
- Interpreting time-series data patterns

## Prometheus Fundamentals

### Metric Types

**Counter**: Cumulative value that only increases (e.g., total requests, error count)
- Use `rate()` or `increase()` to get per-second rate or total increase
- Example: `http_requests_total`

**Gauge**: Value that can go up or down (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, queue depth)
- Query directly or use functions like `avg_over_time()`
- Example: `node_memory_usage_bytes`

**Histogram**: Distribution of values in buckets (e.g., request durations)
- Provides `_sum`, `_count`, and `_bucket` metrics
- Use for percentile calculations
- Example: `http_request_duration_seconds`

**Summary**: Similar to histogram but with pre-calculated quantiles
- Example: `http_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.95"}`

### Time Series Format

Metrics have format: `metric_name{label1="value1", label2="value2"}`

Example: `http_requests_total{method="POST", status="500", service="api"}`

## Querying Prometheus

### Basic Queries

**Instant query** (current value):
```promql
http_requests_total
```

**Range query** (over time):
```promql
http_requests_total[5m]
```

**Filter by labels**:
```promql
http_requests_total{status="500", service="api"}
```

**Rate of increase** (per-second rate):
```promql
rate(http_requests_total[5m])
```

### Common Aggregation Functions

**Sum** across dimensions:
```promql
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (status)
```

**Average**:
```promql
avg(node_memory_usage_bytes) by (instance)
```

**Max/Min**:
```promql
max(http_request_duration_seconds) by (endpoint)
```

**Count**:
```promql
count(up == 0)  # Count instances that are down
```

### Useful RCA Queries

**Error rate percentage**:
```promql
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) /
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) * 100
```

**95th percentile latency**:
```promql
histogram_quantile(0.95,
  rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])
)
```

**Request rate by endpoint**:
```promql
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (endpoint)
```

**Memory usage percentage**:
```promql
(node_memory_usage_bytes / node_memory_total_bytes) * 100
```

**Database connection pool usage**:
```promql
sum(db_connection_pool_active) / sum(db_connection_pool_max) * 100
```

## Working with Alerts

### Alert Structure

Prometheus alerts contain:
- **Alert name**: Identifier for the alert rule
- **Labels**: Dimensions and metadata (service, severity, etc.)
- **Annotations**: Human-readable descriptions
- **State**: pending, firing, resolved
- **Active since**: When alert started firing
- **Value**: Current metric value that triggered alert

### Fetching Alert Details

Use Prometheus API to fetch alerts:

**List active alerts**:
```
GET /api/v1/alerts
```

**Query alert rule**:
```
GET /api/v1/rules
```

### Analyzing Alert Context

When investigating an alert:

1. **Check alert expression**: What PromQL query triggered the alert?
2. **Review threshold**: What value caused the alert to fire?
3. **Check alert duration**: How long has condition been true?
4. **Review labels**: What services/instances are affected?
5. **Query related metrics**: Get broader context around the alert

### Example Alert Investigation

Alert: `HighErrorRate`
Expression: `rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.05`

**Investigation queries**:

Query error rate breakdown:
```promql
rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) by (endpoint)
```

Query total request rate:
```promql
rate(http_requests_total[5m])
```

Query error rate percentage:
```promql
(sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) /
 sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))) * 100
```

Check for correlated latency increase:
```promql
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
```

## Metrics Patterns for RCA

### Pattern 1: Sudden Spike

**Signature**: Metric jumps sharply at specific time

**Possible causes**:
- Code deployment
- Configuration change
- Traffic surge
- Dependency failure

**Investigation**:
- Correlate spike time with deployments
- Check for sudden traffic increase
- Query dependency health metrics
- Review recent configuration changes

### Pattern 2: Gradual Increase

**Signature**: Metric grows steadily over hours/days

**Possible causes**:
- Memory leak
- Resource exhaustion
- Unbounded data growth
- Missing cleanup job

**Investigation**:
- Check memory/disk usage trends
- Review data volume growth
- Query for resource leaks
- Check scheduled job execution

### Pattern 3: Periodic Pattern

**Signature**: Metric spikes at regular intervals

**Possible causes**:
- Scheduled job or cron
- Batch processing
- Cache expiration
- Garbage collection

**Investigation**:
- Identify period (hourly, daily, etc.)
- Check for scheduled tasks at that interval
- Review batch job schedules
- Query job execution metrics

### Pattern 4: Drop to Zero

**Signature**: Metric suddenly drops to zero or very low value

**Possible causes**:
- Service crash
- Instance termination
- Network partition
- Monitoring failure

**Investigation**:
- Check service health (`up` metric)
- Review instance count
- Query service availability
- Check for infrastructure changes

### Pattern 5: High Variability

**Signature**: Metric fluctuates wildly

**Possible causes**:
- Intermittent errors
- Race condition
- Resource contention
- Unhealthy load balancing

**Investigation**:
- Check error logs for patterns
- Review load distribution across instances
- Query resource utilization
- Check for concurrency issues

## Time Range Selection

Choose appropriate time ranges for investigation:

**Incident detection** (5-15 minutes):
```promql
rate(metric[5m])
```

**Trend analysis** (1-6 hours):
```promql
rate(metric[1h])
```

**Long-term patterns** (1-7 days):
```promql
avg_over_time(metric[1d])
```

**Comparison with past**:
```promql
# Current value
metric

# Value 1 week ago
metric offset 1w
```

## Correlating Metrics

### Multiple Metric Analysis

Query related metrics together to understand full context:

```promql
# Error rate
rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])

# Latency
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# Request rate
rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# CPU usage
rate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m])

# Memory usage
process_resident_memory_bytes
```

### Identifying Correlations

Look for metrics that change together:
- Error rate ↑ + Latency ↑ → Performance degradation
- Error rate ↑ + CPU ↑ → Resource exhaustion
- Error rate ↑ + Request rate ↑ → Traffic surge
- Error rate ↑ + Dependency metric ↓ → Dependency failure

## Best Practices

### Query Writing

- Use appropriate time ranges (5m for recent, 1h for trends)
- Filter by relevant labels to reduce cardinality
- Use `rate()` for counters, not raw values
- Aggregate when dealing with multiple instances
- Use recording rules for expensive queries

### Alert Investigation

- Start with alert expression to understand trigger
- Query wider time range to see pattern before/after
- Break down aggregated metrics to find specific instances/endpoints
- Check for correlated metric changes
- Compare current values with historical baseline

### Metric Interpretation

- Consider metric type (counter, gauge, histogram)
- Look for patterns over time, not just current values
- Compare across instances to find outliers
- Correlate with other metrics for complete picture
- Validate hypotheses with multiple metrics

## Integration with Thufir

This skill works with:
- **Prometheus MCP server**: Fetches alerts and queries metrics via API
- **root-cause-analysis skill**: Metrics provide evidence for RCA
- **RCA agent**: Agent queries Prometheus to gather metric data

### Using Prometheus MCP

The Thufir plugin includes Prometheus MCP server for querying:

**Query instant value**:
```
Use MCP tool: prometheus_query
Query: rate(http_requests_total[5m])
```

**Query time range**:
```
Use MCP tool: prometheus_query_range
Query: rate(http_requests_total[5m])
Start: 2025-12-19T14:00:00Z
End: 2025-12-19T15:00:00Z
Step: 15s
```

**Fetch active alerts**:
```
Use MCP tool: prometheus_alerts
```
