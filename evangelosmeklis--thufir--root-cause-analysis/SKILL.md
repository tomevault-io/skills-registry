# Root Cause Analysis Methodology

## Overview

Root cause analysis (RCA) is a systematic investigation process to identify the underlying cause of production incidents, errors, and outages. This skill provides structured methodologies for conducting effective RCA that goes beyond surface-level symptoms to find actionable root causes.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply this skill when:
- Production alerts fire indicating system degradation
- Users report errors or unexpected behavior
- Incidents occur requiring post-mortem investigation
- Metrics show anomalous patterns
- Any situation requiring systematic debugging of production issues

## Core RCA Principles

### 1. Timeline Reconstruction

Establish a clear timeline of events:
- Identify when the issue first appeared (error logs, metrics, user reports)
- Note when alerts fired or detection occurred
- Map recent changes (deployments, configuration changes, infrastructure changes)
- Identify when the issue resolved (if applicable)

Create a visual timeline connecting:
- **WHEN**: Timestamps of key events
- **WHAT**: What changed or broke at each point
- **WHERE**: Which systems, services, or components were affected

### 2. Symptom vs. Root Cause

Distinguish between symptoms and root causes:

**Symptoms** are observable effects:
- "API returning 500 errors"
- "Database queries timing out"
- "Memory usage at 95%"

**Root causes** are underlying reasons:
- "Connection pool exhausted due to size reduction in deployment"
- "Missing database index causing full table scans"
- "Memory leak introduced in commit abc123"

Always trace from symptoms to root causes by asking "why?" repeatedly.

### 3. The Five Whys Technique

Ask "why?" five times to drill down from symptom to root cause:

**Example:**
1. **Why** are users seeing errors? → API is returning 500s
2. **Why** is API returning 500s? → Database queries are timing out
3. **Why** are queries timing out? → Connection pool is exhausted
4. **Why** is connection pool exhausted? → Pool size was reduced from 100 to 10
5. **Why** was pool size reduced? → Deployment of commit abc123 changed configuration

Root cause: Configuration change in commit abc123 reduced pool size inappropriately.

### 4. Data-Driven Investigation

Base conclusions on evidence:
- **Metrics**: Error rates, latency percentiles, resource utilization
- **Logs**: Error messages, stack traces, debug output
- **Code**: Recent commits, blame information, diff analysis
- **Configuration**: Recent changes to config files, environment variables
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment logs, scaling events, resource changes

Avoid speculation—validate hypotheses with data.

## RCA Investigation Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Initial Information

Collect the triggering incident data:
- Alert details (name, severity, time, affected systems)
- Error messages and stack traces
- Relevant metrics (error rates, latency, resource usage)
- User reports or issue descriptions

### Step 2: Establish Scope and Impact

Determine:
- **Scope**: Which services, endpoints, or features are affected?
- **Severity**: How many users impacted? Revenue impact?
- **Duration**: When did it start? Is it ongoing?
- **Frequency**: One-time or recurring issue?

### Step 3: Build Timeline of Events

Construct chronological timeline:
1. Query metrics to find when anomaly started
2. Identify recent deployments or changes before incident
3. Note when alerts fired
4. Map any correlated events (scaling, traffic spikes, dependency failures)

### Step 4: Search Codebase for Related Code

Identify relevant code:
- Search for error messages in logs
- Find files/functions mentioned in stack traces
- Locate services or components mentioned in alerts
- Use grep to find error-handling code, API endpoints, database queries

Focus on:
- Entry points (API endpoints, event handlers)
- Data access layer (database queries, cache operations)
- External integrations (third-party APIs, message queues)

### Step 5: Analyze Recent Changes

Use git to find recent changes to relevant code:
- **git log**: Recent commits to affected files
- **git blame**: Who changed specific lines and when
- **git diff**: What changed between working and broken versions
- **git bisect**: Binary search to find breaking commit (for regressions)

Prioritize commits made shortly before incident started.

### Step 6: Correlate Changes with Timeline

Connect code changes to incident timeline:
- Did deployment coincide with error spike?
- Was configuration changed near incident start?
- Did dependency update introduce regression?

Look for temporal correlation between changes and symptoms.

### Step 7: Identify Root Cause

Synthesize findings to pinpoint root cause:
- What specific code, configuration, or infrastructure change caused symptoms?
- Why did this change cause the problem?
- What assumption or validation was missing?

Ensure root cause is:
- **Specific**: Not "the code is buggy" but "missing null check in function X"
- **Actionable**: Can be fixed with specific changes
- **Validated**: Supported by evidence (metrics, logs, code)

### Step 8: Verify Root Cause Hypothesis

Validate the identified root cause:
- Confirm timeline alignment (change introduced before symptoms appeared)
- Check if reverting change would resolve issue
- Look for similar patterns in logs or metrics
- Test hypothesis in staging environment if possible

### Step 9: Document Findings

Create RCA report including:
- **Summary**: One-paragraph overview of incident and root cause
- **Timeline**: Chronological event sequence
- **Root Cause**: Specific code/config change that caused issue
- **Impact**: Scope, severity, duration, affected users
- **Evidence**: Metrics, logs, commits supporting conclusion
- **Suggested Fix**: How to resolve and prevent recurrence

See `examples/rca-report-template.md` for report structure.

## Investigation Techniques

### Searching for Error Patterns

When analyzing error messages:
1. Extract key terms from error message (excluding variable values)
2. Search codebase for error string
3. Find where error is raised or logged
4. Trace backwards to identify trigger conditions

**Example:**
Error: `ConnectionPoolExhausted: Could not acquire connection within timeout`

Search for: `ConnectionPoolExhausted` or `Could not acquire connection`
Find: Connection pool configuration and usage
Trace: Recent changes to pool size or connection usage patterns

### Using Git Blame Effectively

Git blame identifies when lines were last changed:
```bash
git blame path/to/file.js
```

Focus on:
- Lines mentioned in stack traces
- Configuration values that seem incorrect
- Error-handling code paths
- Recently changed lines (within incident timeframe)

Cross-reference blame timestamps with incident timeline.

### Analyzing Metrics Patterns

Look for metric patterns indicating root cause:
- **Sudden spike**: Deployment, configuration change, traffic surge
- **Gradual increase**: Memory leak, resource exhaustion, unbounded growth
- **Periodic pattern**: Cron job, scheduled task, batch process
- **Correlation**: Multiple metrics changing together (cause and effect)

Compare metrics before, during, and after incident.

### Dependency Analysis

Consider dependencies that could cause issues:
- Third-party API failures or slowdowns
- Database performance degradation
- Message queue backlogs
- Infrastructure resource constraints
- Network issues or DNS resolution failures

Check dependency health metrics and status pages.

## Common Root Cause Categories

### Code Changes
- New bugs introduced in recent commits
- Logic errors in conditionals or loops
- Missing error handling or validation
- Resource leaks (memory, connections, file handles)
- Race conditions or concurrency issues

### Configuration Changes
- Incorrect values (pool sizes, timeouts, limits)
- Missing required configuration
- Environment variable changes
- Feature flag toggles

### Infrastructure Changes
- Scaling events (too few or too many instances)
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)
- Network configuration changes
- Load balancer settings

### Dependency Changes
- Library or framework version updates
- Third-party API changes or outages
- Database schema migrations
- Message queue or cache issues

### Data Issues
- Unexpected data volumes (traffic spikes)
- Malformed data triggering edge cases
- Data migration problems
- Schema changes breaking assumptions

## Best Practices

### Do:
- Start with evidence (metrics, logs, errors)
- Build clear timeline before theorizing
- Use Five Whys to drill down from symptoms
- Validate hypotheses with data
- Focus on specific, actionable root causes
- Document findings thoroughly

### Don't:
- Jump to conclusions without evidence
- Stop at symptoms ("database is slow" isn't a root cause)
- Blame individuals (focus on systems and processes)
- Ignore timeline correlations
- Leave findings undocumented
