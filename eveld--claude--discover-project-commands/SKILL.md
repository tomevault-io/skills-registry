# Discover Project Commands

Automatically discover and document all available commands in the project for reference during planning and implementation.

## What to Discover

### Make Targets
Check for `Makefile` and extract all targets:
- Use `make -qp` or parse Makefile directly
- Document target names and descriptions (from comments)

### NPM Scripts
Check for `package.json` and extract scripts:
- Read package.json
- Document script names and what they do

### Go Commands
If Go project, document standard commands:
- `go test ./...`
- `go build ./...`
- `go run`
- Custom test/build commands

### Other Build Tools
Check for and document:
- Gradle tasks
- Maven goals
- Cargo commands
- Python setup.py commands

## Output Format

Write to: `thoughts/notes/commands.md`

Use the template from `templates/commands-reference.md` and populate with discovered commands.

## Discovery Process

1. **Check for Makefile**: Parse targets and descriptions
2. **Check for package.json**: Extract npm scripts
3. **Detect language**: Look for go.mod, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.
4. **Document commands**: Use template to create reference doc
5. **Include metadata**: Add timestamp and project name
