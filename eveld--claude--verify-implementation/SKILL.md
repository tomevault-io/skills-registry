# Verify Implementation

Run verification commands after implementing changes to ensure correctness.

## Verification Sources

Check `thoughts/notes/commands.md` (created by `discover-project-commands` skill) for:
- Available test commands
- Linting commands
- Build commands
- Other project-specific verification

## IMPORTANT: Always Use Verification Agent

**DO NOT run verification commands directly in main context.**

Spawn a verification agent to run checks and return summary:

```markdown
Task(subagent_type="Bash",
     prompt="Run verification commands from plan success criteria:
     - make test
     - make lint
     - make build
     [list all automated checks from plan]

     Return concise summary:
     - If all pass: ✅ All verification passed
     - If any fail: ❌ Verification failed
       - List ONLY the failing checks
       - Include first few lines of error
       - Omit stack traces and verbose output

     Maximum output: 2k tokens")
```

**Why use an agent**:
- Raw output can be 10k+ tokens (floods main agent context)
- Agent filters to only essential info (1-2k tokens)
- Keeps main agent focused on implementation
- Part of token management strategy (see `spawn-implementation-agents`)

**Agent returns**:
- ✅ Pass status or ❌ Fail status
- Only failed checks (not successful ones)
- First few lines of errors (not full output)
- Actionable information only

## Common Verification Steps

### 1. Run Tests
Check commands.md, then run appropriate command:
- `make test` - If Make target exists
- `npm test` - If npm script exists
- `go test ./...` - Direct Go command
- `pytest` - Direct Python command

### 2. Run Linting
Check commands.md, then run:
- `make lint` - If Make target exists
- `npm run lint` - If npm script exists
- `golangci-lint run` - Direct Go command
- `eslint .` - Direct JavaScript command

### 3. Build Check
Check commands.md, then run:
- `make build` - If Make target exists
- `npm run build` - If npm script exists
- `go build ./...` - Direct Go command

### 4. Type Checking (if applicable)
- `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript
- `mypy .` - Python
- Go builds include type checking

## Verification Workflow

1. **Check for commands.md**: Read `thoughts/notes/commands.md`
2. **Run automated checks**: Use commands from reference doc
3. **Report results**: Show pass/fail for each check
4. **Manual verification**: Prompt for manual testing if needed

## Handling Failures

If verification fails:
1. Show the error output
2. Analyze the error
3. Fix the issue
4. Re-run verification
5. Don't mark task complete until all checks pass

## Example

```bash
# Read the commands reference
cat thoughts/notes/commands.md

# Run appropriate commands
make test
make lint
make build

# All pass? Mark phase complete in plan
# Any fail? Debug and fix before proceeding
```

## Important

Always spawn agent for verification - never run commands directly in main context.

See `spawn-implementation-agents` skill for full orchestration pattern.
