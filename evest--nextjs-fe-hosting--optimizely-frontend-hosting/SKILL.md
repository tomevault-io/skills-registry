# Optimizely Frontend Hosting

Deploy and manage Next.js applications on Optimizely Frontend Hosting for CMS (SaaS).

## Overview

Optimizely Frontend Hosting is a cloud-based solution for deploying headless Next.js applications with an Optimizely CMS (SaaS) backend. It provides managed environments (Test1, Test2, Production) with built-in CDN and WAF powered by Cloudflare.

**Key characteristics:**
- Next.js support only (SSG and SSR, ISR not yet supported)
- Managed environments integrated with CMS (SaaS)
- Automatic CDN and WAF configuration
- Static site hosting with Azure infrastructure

## Workflow Decision Tree

**User says "Set up frontend hosting":**
1. Check if environment variables exist in project
2. If missing, read `references/environment-variables.md` for guidance
3. Create `.env` file with required variables
4. Create or update `.zipignore` from `assets/.zipignore.template`
5. Verify `package.json` has required scripts (see `assets/package.json.template`)
6. Guide user on obtaining API credentials from PaaS Portal

**User says "Deploy to frontend hosting":**
1. Read `references/deployment-guide.md` for detailed process
2. Use `scripts/deploy.ps1` for automated deployment
3. Or guide through manual PowerShell deployment steps
4. Monitor deployment status

**User says "Configure deployment settings":**
1. Check current environment variables
2. Read `references/environment-variables.md` for details
3. Use `scripts/setup-env.ps1` to configure variables

**User encounters deployment errors:**
1. Read `references/troubleshooting.md` for common issues
2. Check deployment logs
3. Verify package naming and structure

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Three environment variables must be set before deployment:

```powershell
$env:OPTI_PROJECT_ID = "<your_project_id>"
$env:OPTI_CLIENT_KEY = "<your_client_key>"
$env:OPTI_CLIENT_SECRET = "<your_client_secret>"
```

These are obtained from **PaaS Portal > API tab** for your frontend project.

For permanent setup, use `scripts/setup-env.ps1` or add to system environment variables.

### Project Configuration

Ensure the Next.js project has:

1. **package.json** with required scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

2. **.zipignore** file to exclude:
   - `.next`
   - `node_modules`
   - `.env`
   - `.git`
   - `.DS_Store`
   - `.vscode`

See `assets/.zipignore.template` for complete example.

## Deployment Process

### Quick Deployment (Automated)

For automated deployment, use the provided script:

```powershell
# From project root
.\deploy.ps1
```

The script (located in `scripts/deploy.ps1`):
- Validates environment variables
- Creates deployment package with .zipignore support
- Uploads to Azure
- Triggers deployment to configured environment

### Manual Deployment Steps

For detailed manual deployment process, read `references/deployment-guide.md`. Summary:

1. **Install EpiCloud module**:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name EpiCloud -Scope CurrentUser -Force
Import-Module EpiCloud
```

2. **Create deployment package**:
   - Package name format: `<n>.head.app.<version>.zip`
   - Example: `myapp.head.app.20250610.zip`
   - Must include `package.json` at root
   - Exclude `.next` and `node_modules`

3. **Upload and deploy**:
```powershell
Connect-EpiCloud -ProjectId $projectId -ClientKey $clientKey -ClientSecret $clientSecret
$sasUrl = Get-EpiDeploymentPackageLocation
Add-EpiDeploymentPackage -SasUrl $sasUrl -Path .\myapp.head.app.20250610.zip
Start-EpiDeployment -DeploymentPackage "myapp.head.app.20250610.zip" -TargetEnvironment Test1 -DirectDeploy -Wait -Verbose
```

### Target Environments

For **SaaS Frontend Hosting**, use:
- `Test1`
- `Test2`
- `Production`

For **PaaS hosting** (CMS 12), use:
- `Integration`
- `Preproduction`
- `Production`

## Runtime Environment Variables

The following variables are automatically available during build and runtime:

- `OPTIMIZELY_CMS_URL` - CMS backend URL
- `OPTIMIZELY_GRAPH_GATEWAY` - Optimizely Graph endpoint
- `OPTIMIZELY_GRAPH_SECRET` - Graph authentication secret
- `OPTIMIZELY_GRAPH_SINGLE_KEY` - Graph single key
- `OPTIMIZELY_GRAPH_APP_KEY` - Graph app key

**Important!** the `OPTIMIZELY_GRAPH_GATEWAY` environment variable in the Optimizely Frontend Hosting runtime does not have a path to the Graph API, only the full hostname. Typically this is: `https://cg.optimizely.com` while the Optimizely Content JS SDK needs the full path to the Graph like ``

Here is an example library function to use when getting the full path:
```typescript
const DEFAULT_GRAPH_PATH = "/content/v2";

/**
 * Returns the Optimizely Graph gateway URL with the full path.
 *
 * In production (Frontend Hosting), the env var may be set to just the base URL:
 *   "https://cg.optimizely.com"
 *
 * Locally it includes the full path:
 *   "https://cg.optimizely.com/content/v2"
 *
 * This function ensures the full path is always present.
 * The path can be configured via OPTIMIZELY_GRAPH_PATH env var.
 */
export function getGraphGatewayUrl(): string {
  const gateway = process.env.OPTIMIZELY_GRAPH_GATEWAY;
  const graphPath = process.env.OPTIMIZELY_GRAPH_PATH || DEFAULT_GRAPH_PATH;

  if (!gateway) {
    throw new Error("OPTIMIZELY_GRAPH_GATEWAY environment variable is not set");
  }

  // If the gateway already ends with the path, return as-is
  if (gateway.endsWith(graphPath)) {
    return gateway;
  }

  // Remove trailing slash if present, then append the path
  const baseUrl = gateway.replace(/\/+$/, "");
  return `${baseUrl}${graphPath}`;
}
```

It is being used like this:
```typescript
  const client = new GraphClient(process.env.OPTIMIZELY_GRAPH_SINGLE_KEY!, {
    graphUrl: getGraphGatewayUrl(),
  });
```

Additional app settings can be configured through the Management Portal UI.

## Common Tasks

### Check Current Configuration

```powershell
# View environment variables
echo $env:OPTI_PROJECT_ID
echo $env:OPTI_CLIENT_KEY
echo $env:OPTI_CLIENT_SECRET

# Check deployment status
Get-EpiDeployment
```

### Update Deployment Script Settings

Edit `scripts/deploy.ps1` to customize:
- `$sourcePath` - Path to Next.js app
- `$targetEnvironment` - Target environment name

### Troubleshoot Deployment Issues

For troubleshooting, read `references/troubleshooting.md` which covers:
- Missing environment variables during build
- Invalid ZIP package structure
- Incorrect naming conventions
- Build failures
- File exclusion issues
