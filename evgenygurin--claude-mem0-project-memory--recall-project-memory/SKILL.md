# Recall Project Memory Skill

## Purpose

This skill enables you to automatically search project memory for relevant context before making decisions or implementing features. It helps maintain consistency with past decisions and avoid repeating mistakes.

## When to Invoke

Automatically consider using this skill when:

1. **Starting new features**: Check if similar features exist or related patterns were established
2. **Making architectural decisions**: See if similar decisions were made and what rationale was used
3. **Debugging**: Look for past solutions to similar problems
4. **Refactoring**: Understand why current structure exists before changing
5. **User asks about history**: "How did we handle X?", "Why did we choose Y?"

## How to Use

### Step 1: Identify Context

From the current task or conversation, extract:
- Technical domain (auth, database, API, frontend, etc.)
- Specific components or files being discussed
- Type of work (decision, implementation, debugging, refactoring)
- Key concepts or patterns mentioned

### Step 2: Formulate Search Query

Create semantic search query combining:
- Domain keywords
- Problem/feature description
- Technology stack terms

Example queries:
- "authentication JWT token refresh"
- "database migration strategy postgres"
- "error handling async functions"
- "API rate limiting implementation"

### Step 3: Query Mem0

Use MCP mem0 tools to:
```
search_memories(
  query: "<semantic query>",
  user_id: "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR_NAME}",
  limit: 5-10
)
```

Filter by:
- Project scope (always use project name as user_id)
- Relevance threshold (>0.7)
- Memory types (decisions, patterns, constraints)

### Step 4: Apply Retrieved Context

**If relevant memories found:**
- Briefly mention: "Found relevant past decision about X"
- Apply patterns/constraints to current task
- Maintain consistency with established approaches
- If conflicting with past, explain why deviation is needed

**If no relevant memories:**
- Proceed normally
- Consider capturing new decision if significant

**If memories are outdated:**
- Note the change in context
- Suggest updating the memory

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Implementation

**User:** "Add user authentication to the API"

**You should:**
1. Search: "authentication API security user"
2. Find memory: "Decision [2024-10]: Use JWT with 15min expiry, refresh tokens"
3. Apply: "I'll implement authentication using JWT tokens as previously decided..."
4. Reference: "This aligns with our established auth pattern [mem0:xyz]"

### Example 2: Debugging

**User:** "The async function is throwing errors randomly"

**You should:**
1. Search: "error handling async functions"
2. Find memory: "Pattern: Always use Result<T, E> for async operations"
3. Check: Review current code against pattern
4. Fix: "I see the issue - we should wrap this in Result<> per our pattern..."

### Example 3: No Relevant Memory

**User:** "Add caching layer"

**You should:**
1. Search: "caching cache layer"
2. No results
3. Proceed: "I don't see any past caching decisions. Let's design this..."
4. Later: Suggest capturing the decision

## Output Format

When memory is relevant:

```markdown
🧠 **Project Memory**: Found relevant context from <date>
- <brief summary of memory>
- <how it applies to current task>
```

Keep it concise - don't overwhelm the user. The goal is to:
- Surface relevant context seamlessly
- Maintain consistency
- Avoid redundant explanations

## Best Practices

1. **Don't over-retrieve**: Only search when genuinely relevant
2. **Be specific**: Use precise search terms related to current task
3. **Stay concise**: Mention memory briefly, focus on applying it
4. **Update proactively**: If memory is outdated, suggest updating it
5. **Trust the search**: Mem0 uses semantic similarity, so approximate terms work

## Error Handling

- **Mem0 unavailable**: Proceed without memory, log gracefully
- **Search timeout**: Fall back to local knowledge, continue task
- **No API key**: Skip memory retrieval, work normally
- **Ambiguous results**: Ask user for clarification on which approach to follow

## Progressive Loading

If you need more details about a memory:
1. Initial search returns summary
2. If needed, retrieve full memory by ID
3. If memory references files, read those files for complete context
