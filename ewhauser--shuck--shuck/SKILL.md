description: Profile shuck scripts and large-corpus fixtures, especially requests to profile a corpus script/fixture, reprofile after a shuck performance change, or produce a hotspot table from a samply profile. Use when Codex needs to run the shuck large-corpus profiling harness, avoid corpus setup artifacts, interpret sampled profiles, and return an attributed-exclusive hotspot table. Use when this capability is needed.

# Profile Shuck Script

## Workflow

1. Work from the current `shuck` checkout. If the user asks for a fresh branch, create it from `main` before editing.
2. Ensure the profiling harness profiles the lint loop, not corpus setup:
   - Prefer `scripts/profiling/profile_large_corpus.sh <fixture> .cache/profiles 2000 1 12`.
   - The script should build the profiling binary, prepare any large-corpus fixture manifest before `samply record`, then run the sampled process using that manifest.
   - If the sampled profile includes corpus discovery, fixture-table construction, or resolver canonicalization, call that out as a setup artifact and fix the harness or exclude it before presenting hotspots.
3. Run the profile at least once after a rebuild and again warm if the first run includes rebuild/cold-start noise.
4. Summarize the newest saved profile with `scripts/summarize_samply_hotspots.py`.
5. Return an attributed-exclusive table, not a raw inclusive table.
6. If a single fat frame (e.g. `LinterFactsBuilder::build`) dominates the summary, drill into its sub-frames with `scripts/drilldown_subframes.py` before recommending optimizations.

## Commands

Build/profile a large-corpus fixture:

```bash
scripts/profiling/profile_large_corpus.sh xwmx__nb__nb .cache/profiles 2000 1 12
```

Summarize the latest samply profile:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/profile-shuck-script/scripts/summarize_samply_hotspots.py \
  .cache/profiles/large-corpus/xwmx__nb__nb.json.gz \
  target/profiling/examples/large_corpus_profile \
  --limit 12
```

Use the profile output's reported average from the harness stderr, not a profile-wide estimate, when stating wall-clock time.

Drill into a fat parent frame (default targets `LinterFactsBuilder::build` and the `shuck_linter::facts::` namespace):

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/profile-shuck-script/scripts/drilldown_subframes.py \
  .cache/profiles/large-corpus/xwmx__nb__nb.json.gz \
  target/profiling/examples/large_corpus_profile \
  --limit 30
```

Override `--parent` and `--namespace` when drilling into a different layer (for example
`--parent shuck_semantic::SemanticModel::build --namespace shuck_semantic::`). Output is a
percent-of-total / percent-of-parent breakdown of the deepest namespace-matching frame above
the parent on each stack; samples whose only matching frame is generic library code (allocator,
hashing, memchr, etc.) are bucketed under `<non-... leaf>`.

Sample output:

```markdown
total_samples=12345
parent_samples=4321 (35.0% of total)

| Rank | Sub-frame | % of total | % of parent | Top leaf |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | `shuck_linter::facts::case_patterns::StaticCasePatternMatcher::advance` | 3.3% | 9.4% | `core::str::...` |
| 2 | `shuck_linter::facts::semantic_declaration_for_command` | 2.1% | 6.0% | `hashbrown::...` |
```

## Table Style

Use "attributed exclusive" samples:

- Count each sample once.
- Attribute generic frames such as iterator adapters, `OnceLock`, `memchr`, allocation, and syscalls to the nearest meaningful shuck/semantic/parser caller when possible.
- Keep separate rows for setup artifacts only when they are truly inside the sampled workload.
- Do not lead with parent orchestration frames such as `main`, `Checker::check`, or `lint_file_at_path...`; those are usually inclusive wrappers.

Return a concise table like:

```markdown
Latest profile: `<fixture>`, 12 iterations, avg `<N> ms`.

| Rank | Hotspot | Attributed Exclusive | Representative Frame | Read |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Linter facts builder | 55.8% | `facts::LinterFactsBuilder::build` | Clear next big target |
| 2 | Possible-variable-misspelling rule | 5.2% | `possible_variable_misspelling` | Rule-local matching |
```

If the user is debugging whether a row is real, add a short note after the table explaining the evidence from stack context.

## Interpretation Rules

- Treat unexpectedly large file open/read/canonicalization rows with suspicion. In this workflow they often mean the profiler captured corpus discovery or resolver setup, not linting.
- If I/O remains after loop-only profiling, split it into target fixture source read, source-closure sibling reads, manifest load, and path canonicalization.
- If C063 appears, mention whether it is still material after the activation-window index. Around 1-2% is no longer the main target.
- If `LinterFactsBuilder::build` dominates, identify it as the next broad optimization area rather than a single rule hotspot, then run `drilldown_subframes.py` to surface the specific facts sub-frames worth attacking.

## Validation

For harness edits, run:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo build --profile profiling -p shuck-benchmark --features large-corpus-hotspots --example large_corpus_profile
git diff --check
```

For rule-performance edits, also run the targeted rule tests and corpus gate relevant to the changed rule.
