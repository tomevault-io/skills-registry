# Publish Study

Takes a completed study directory (containing results, an experiment design, and an analysis report) and publishes it as a GitHub repository. The analysis report becomes `README.md` so it renders nicely on GitHub.

## Usage

```
/publish-study
/publish-study 2026-02-08_do-llms-exhibit-maternal-default-bias-when
```

If no study directory is specified, auto-detect from the current working directory by looking for directories matching `YYYY-MM-DD_*`.

## Workflow

### 1. Locate the Study Directory

If a directory was provided, confirm it exists. Otherwise, find candidates:

```python
import glob
import os

candidates = sorted(glob.glob("./[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]_*"), key=os.path.getmtime, reverse=True)
candidates = [d for d in candidates if os.path.isdir(d)]
```

- **If zero candidates**, tell the user no study directories were found.
- **If exactly one**, use it automatically.
- **If multiple**, use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user pick:

```
Question: "Which study do you want to publish?"
Header: "Study"
Options: [list each directory as an option with its name as label and first line of experiment_design.md as description]
```

### 2. Select the Analysis

Find `analysis_N/` subdirectories that contain `report.md`:

```python
import os, glob

analysis_dirs = sorted(glob.glob(f"{study_dir}/analysis_*/"))
with_reports = [d for d in analysis_dirs if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(d, "report.md"))]
```

- **If zero**, tell the user to run `/analyze-results` first.
- **If exactly one**, use it automatically.
- **If multiple**, use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user pick which analysis to feature as the README:

```
Question: "Which analysis should be the primary report (README.md)?"
Header: "Analysis"
Options: [list each analysis_N with first line of its report.md as description]
```

### 3. Ensure Results Are on Expected Parrot

Check for `results.json.gz` in the study directory and push it to Expected Parrot so the repo can link to it for reproducibility.

```python
from edsl import Results

results = Results.load(f"{study_dir}/results")  # loads results.json.gz

# Push to Expected Parrot (unlisted by default)
info = results.push(description="Results for: <study_slug>")

# Extract the UUID and URL from the push response
# info is a dict with 'uuid' and 'url' keys
results_uuid = info["uuid"]
results_url = info["url"]
print(f"Results pushed: {results_url}")
print(f"UUID: {results_uuid}")
```

If the push fails or `results.json.gz` doesn't exist, warn the user but continue — the reproducibility section will note that results are not available on Expected Parrot.

### 4. Stage Repo Contents

Build the repository contents in a temporary directory. Copy files from the study and analysis directories:

```bash
# Create temp staging directory
mkdir -p /tmp/publish-study-staging
mkdir -p /tmp/publish-study-staging/images
mkdir -p /tmp/publish-study-staging/data
mkdir -p /tmp/publish-study-staging/questions
```

#### File Mapping

| Source | Destination in Repo | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| `analysis_N/report.md` | `README.md` | Rewrite image/data paths, append reproducibility footer |
| `analysis_N/*.png` | `images/*.png` | All chart PNGs from the analysis |
| `experiment_design.md` | `experiment_design.md` | Research design document |
| `*_study.py` (or similar) | `study.py` | The experiment script |
| `analysis_N/survey.md` | `survey.md` | Survey documentation |
| `analysis_N/results.csv` | `data/results.csv` | Tabular results |
| `analysis_N/<slug>/answer.md` | `questions/<slug>.md` | Answer-question outputs (if any) |
| `analysis_N/<slug>/*.png` | `questions/<slug>/*.png` | Answer charts (if any) |
| — | `LICENSE` | MIT license (generated) |

#### Copy Commands

```bash
STUDY_DIR="<study_dir>"
ANALYSIS_DIR="<analysis_dir>"
STAGING="/tmp/publish-study-staging"

# Clean staging area
rm -rf "$STAGING"
mkdir -p "$STAGING/images" "$STAGING/data" "$STAGING/questions"

# Copy analysis PNGs to images/
cp "$ANALYSIS_DIR"/*.png "$STAGING/images/" 2>/dev/null || true

# Copy experiment design
cp "$STUDY_DIR/experiment_design.md" "$STAGING/experiment_design.md" 2>/dev/null || true

# Copy study script (find the *_study.py or similar)
cp "$STUDY_DIR"/*_study.py "$STAGING/study.py" 2>/dev/null || \
cp "$STUDY_DIR"/*_survey.py "$STAGING/study.py" 2>/dev/null || \
cp "$STUDY_DIR"/*.py "$STAGING/study.py" 2>/dev/null || true

# Copy survey documentation
cp "$ANALYSIS_DIR/survey.md" "$STAGING/survey.md" 2>/dev/null || true

# Copy results CSV
cp "$ANALYSIS_DIR/results.csv" "$STAGING/data/results.csv" 2>/dev/null || true
```

#### Copy Answer-Question Outputs

Check for subdirectories inside the analysis directory that contain `answer.md`:

```python
import glob, os, shutil

staging = "/tmp/publish-study-staging"
analysis_dir = "<analysis_dir>"

answer_dirs = [d for d in glob.glob(f"{analysis_dir}/*/")
               if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(d, "answer.md"))]

for answer_dir in answer_dirs:
    slug = os.path.basename(answer_dir.rstrip("/"))
    dest = f"{staging}/questions/{slug}"
    os.makedirs(dest, exist_ok=True)

    # Copy answer.md as <slug>.md
    shutil.copy2(f"{answer_dir}/answer.md", f"{staging}/questions/{slug}.md")

    # Copy any PNGs
    for png in glob.glob(f"{answer_dir}/*.png"):
        os.makedirs(f"{dest}", exist_ok=True)
        shutil.copy2(png, f"{dest}/{os.path.basename(png)}")
```

### 5. Generate README.md

Read the original `report.md` and apply three modifications:

```python
import re

with open(f"{analysis_dir}/report.md", "r") as f:
    readme = f.read()

# 1. Rewrite image paths: (foo.png) -> (images/foo.png)
#    Match markdown image syntax ![desc](filename.png)
readme = re.sub(
    r'(!\[[^\]]*\])\(([^/)][^)]*\.png)\)',
    r'\1(images/\2)',
    readme
)

# 2. Rewrite results.csv links: (results.csv) -> (data/results.csv)
readme = readme.replace("(results.csv)", "(data/results.csv)")

# 3. Append reproducibility footer
footer = f"""

## Reproducibility

This study was conducted using [Expected Parrot EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/).

### Results on Expected Parrot

The full results object is available on Expected Parrot:

- **URL:** [{results_url}]({results_url})
- **UUID:** `{results_uuid}`

### Pull the Results

```python
from edsl import Results

results = Results.pull("{results_uuid}")
df = results.to_pandas()
```

### Study Code

The experiment script is available in [`study.py`](study.py). The experimental design is documented in [`experiment_design.md`](experiment_design.md).

### License

This study and its artifacts are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

*Generated with [Expected Parrot EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/)*
"""

readme += footer

with open(f"{staging}/README.md", "w") as f:
    f.write(readme)
```

If the EP push failed (no `results_uuid`), use a simpler footer without the EP link:

```python
footer_no_ep = """

### 6. Generate LICENSE

Write a standard MIT license file:

```python
from datetime import datetime

year = datetime.now().year

license_text = f"""MIT License

"""

with open(f"{staging}/LICENSE", "w") as f:
    f.write(license_text)
```

### 7. Ask User for Repo Details

Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the repo name, visibility, and GitHub account:

```
Question: "What should the GitHub repo be named?"
Header: "Repo name"
Options:
  1. "<study-slug>" - "Default: slug from the study directory name (without date prefix)"
  2. "Custom name" - "Enter a custom repository name"
```

Then ask about visibility:

```
Question: "Should the repo be public or private?"
Header: "Visibility"
Options:
  1. "Public (Recommended)" - "Anyone can see this repository"
  2. "Private" - "Only you and collaborators can see this repository"
```

The **study slug** is derived from the directory name by stripping the date prefix:

```python
# "2026-02-08_do-llms-exhibit-maternal-default-bias-when" -> "do-llms-exhibit-maternal-default-bias-when"
study_slug = os.path.basename(study_dir).split("_", 1)[1] if "_" in os.path.basename(study_dir) else os.path.basename(study_dir)
```

### 8. Create GitHub Repo and Push

```bash
REPO_NAME="<repo_name>"
VISIBILITY="--public"  # or "--private"
STAGING="/tmp/publish-study-staging"

# Create the GitHub repo
gh repo create "$REPO_NAME" $VISIBILITY --description "Research study: <short description>"

# Initialize git in the staging directory and push
cd "$STAGING"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: publish study results

Generated with Expected Parrot EDSL
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Add remote and push
git remote add origin "$(gh repo view "$REPO_NAME" --json url -q .url)"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 9. Report Back

Tell the user:
- The GitHub repo URL
- A summary of what was published (number of images, whether results are on EP, etc.)
- The direct link to the README (which is the repo homepage)

```
Question: (none — just report)
```

Example output:

```
Published to: https://github.com/<user>/do-llms-exhibit-maternal-default-bias-when

Repository contents:
- README.md (analysis report with 6 charts)
- experiment_design.md
- study.py
- survey.md
- data/results.csv
- images/ (6 PNGs)
- LICENSE (MIT)

Results are also available on Expected Parrot:
  https://expectedparrot.com/content/<uuid>
```

## Example: Publishing the Maternal Default Bias Study

Given a study directory:
```
2026-02-08_do-llms-exhibit-maternal-default-bias-when/
├── experiment_design.md
├── maternal_default_bias_study.py
├── results.json.gz
├── results.csv
└── analysis_1/
    ├── report.md
    ├── report.html
    ├── survey.md
    ├── results.csv
    ├── confidence_by_choice.png
    ├── context_effect_by_model.png
    ├── manipulation_check.png
    ├── maternal_default_by_model.png
    ├── maternal_default_heatmap.png
    ├── order_effect_by_model.png
    └── urgency_effect_by_model.png
```

The published repo would contain:
```
do-llms-exhibit-maternal-default-bias-when/
├── README.md                        # report.md with rewritten paths + reproducibility footer
├── experiment_design.md
├── study.py                         # maternal_default_bias_study.py
├── survey.md
├── LICENSE
├── data/
│   └── results.csv
└── images/
    ├── confidence_by_choice.png
    ├── context_effect_by_model.png
    ├── manipulation_check.png
    ├── maternal_default_by_model.png
    ├── maternal_default_heatmap.png
    ├── order_effect_by_model.png
    └── urgency_effect_by_model.png
```

## Checklist Before Publishing

- [ ] Study directory exists and contains `results.json.gz`
- [ ] At least one `analysis_N/` directory has a `report.md`
- [ ] `experiment_design.md` exists in the study directory
- [ ] A Python study script exists (e.g., `*_study.py`)
- [ ] All image paths in README.md point to `images/`
- [ ] results.csv link points to `data/results.csv`
- [ ] Reproducibility footer includes EP link (if push succeeded)
- [ ] LICENSE file is present
- [ ] GitHub repo was created successfully
- [ ] All files were committed and pushed

## Output

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | Analysis report adapted for GitHub with image paths rewritten and reproducibility footer |
| `experiment_design.md` | Full experimental design document |
| `study.py` | Python script that defines and runs the study |
| `survey.md` | Survey documentation (questions, types, options) |
| `data/results.csv` | Tabular results data |
| `images/*.png` | All analysis chart PNGs |
| `questions/<slug>.md` | Answer-question outputs (if any) |
| `questions/<slug>/*.png` | Answer-question charts (if any) |
| `LICENSE` | MIT license |

## Tips

- Run `/analyze-results` before `/publish-study` — you need at least one analysis with a `report.md`
- If you want to refine the report before publishing, edit `analysis_N/report.md` first
- The repo name defaults to the study slug (directory name without date prefix)
- Results are pushed to Expected Parrot as "unlisted" by default — change visibility on EP separately if needed
- If `gh` CLI is not authenticated, run `gh auth login` first
