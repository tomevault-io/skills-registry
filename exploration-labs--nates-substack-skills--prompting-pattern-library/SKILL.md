## Overview

This skill provides a comprehensive library of prompting patterns, anti-patterns, and model-specific guidance for effective LLM interactions. Use this when creating educational content about prompting, analyzing prompt quality, or explaining prompting techniques to technical and non-technical audiences.

**What's included:**
- 25+ proven prompting patterns with "why it works" analysis
- Common failure modes with diagnosis and fixes
- Model-specific guidance (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
- Advanced orchestration patterns for agent systems
- Cross-references throughout for deep-dive learning

## Quick Reference: Common Prompting Patterns

### Structural Patterns
**Role Prompting**: Assign a specific role or persona to frame the response
**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Request step-by-step reasoning before final answer
**Few-Shot Learning**: Provide examples of desired input-output pairs
**Zero-Shot with Instructions**: Detailed task description without examples
**Tree of Thoughts**: Explore multiple reasoning paths before choosing best

### Output Control Patterns
**Structured Output**: Request specific formats (JSON, XML, tables, lists)
**Delimiters**: Use clear separators for inputs, examples, and instructions
**Length Control**: Specify desired output length explicitly
**Style Constraints**: Define tone, formality, audience level

### Reasoning Enhancement Patterns
**Self-Consistency**: Generate multiple solutions and select most common
**Reflection**: Ask model to critique its own output
**Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks
**Analogical Reasoning**: Request analogies or comparisons

### Retrieval Patterns
**Citation Requirements**: Demand sources and evidence
**Fact-Checking**: Request verification of claims
**Knowledge Boundaries**: Ask model to acknowledge uncertainty

See `references/prompt-patterns.md` for comprehensive pattern catalog with examples.

## When to Read References

### Always Read First
**Creating prompting educational content**: Read `references/prompt-patterns.md` for pattern catalog with "why it works" analysis
**Debugging problematic prompts**: Read `references/failure-modes.md` for common issues and fixes with cross-referenced solutions
**Cross-model implementation**: Read `references/model-quirks.md` for model-specific considerations and optimization
**Building agent systems**: Read `references/orchestration-patterns.md` for multi-step workflows and agentic architectures

### Read When Needed
**Advanced pattern implementation**: Review specific patterns in references for detailed guidance and research basis
**Teaching prompting**: Use examples from references as teaching materials with "why it works" explanations
**Optimizing existing prompts**: Consult failure modes to identify weaknesses, then apply patterns from prompt-patterns.md
**Agent orchestration**: Reference orchestration-patterns.md for planner-executor, multi-agent collaboration, and evaluation loops

## Core Principles for Effective Prompting

### Specificity Over Generality
Vague: "Write about AI"
Specific: "Write a 500-word technical explanation of transformer attention mechanisms for software engineers with no ML background"

### Provide Context Explicitly
Poor context: "Fix this code"
Good context: "Fix this Python function that should validate email addresses. Current issue: it fails on addresses with plus signs. Python 3.11, standard library only."

### Use Examples When Precision Matters
For tasks requiring specific formats or styles, provide 2-3 high-quality examples rather than lengthy descriptions. Examples communicate requirements more precisely than instructions alone.

### Structure Complex Prompts
For multi-part tasks, use clear sections:
1. Context and background
2. Specific task requirements
3. Output format specifications
4. Constraints and limitations
5. Examples (if applicable)

### Iterate Based on Output
Prompting is experimental. Start simple, observe failure modes, refine incrementally. Most effective prompts emerge through iteration, not perfect first attempts.

## Model-Specific Considerations

Different models respond differently to identical prompts. Key differences:

**Claude (Anthropic)**: Strong with structured output, detailed reasoning, and nuanced tasks. Responds well to polite, conversational prompts. Excellent at maintaining context over long conversations.

**GPT-4 (OpenAI)**: Versatile across domains, strong creative writing, good instruction-following. Benefits from explicit structure. Can be more prone to confident errors.

**Gemini (Google)**: Strong multimodal capabilities, good at analytical tasks. May require more explicit formatting instructions.

See `references/model-quirks.md` for detailed model-specific patterns and anti-patterns.

## Common Failure Modes

### The "Too Polite" Problem
Over-apologetic prompts waste tokens and can reduce output quality. Be direct and clear rather than excessively polite.

### Implicit Assumptions
Models cannot read your mind. What seems obvious to you must be stated explicitly. Common implicit assumptions that cause failures:
- Desired output format
- Audience level
- Required depth of detail
- Constraints (time period, geography, etc.)

### Conflicting Instructions
When instructions contradict each other, models exhibit unpredictable behavior. Example conflict: "Be concise but include comprehensive detail."

### Ambiguous Success Criteria
"Make it better" is not actionable. Define what "better" means: faster, more accurate, more readable, more maintainable, etc.

See `references/failure-modes.md` for comprehensive failure patterns and fixes.

## Using This Skill for Content Creation

### Educational Content
When writing prompting guides or tutorials, use patterns from references as examples. Structure content to move from simple (zero-shot) to complex (chain-of-thought, tree-of-thoughts) patterns.

### Prompt Analysis
To analyze prompt effectiveness, compare against patterns in references. Identify which patterns are present or absent, check for common failure modes.

### Prompt Improvement
To improve existing prompts:
1. Identify the task type and check appropriate patterns in references
2. Check against failure modes in `references/failure-modes.md`
3. Apply relevant structural improvements
4. Test and iterate
