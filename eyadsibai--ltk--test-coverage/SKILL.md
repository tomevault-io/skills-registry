# Test Coverage Analysis

Comprehensive test coverage analysis skill for measuring coverage, identifying gaps, and improving test quality.

## Core Capabilities

### Coverage Measurement

Calculate and report code coverage metrics:

**Line Coverage:**

- Percentage of lines executed by tests
- Target: > 80%
- Critical code paths: > 95%

**Branch Coverage:**

- Percentage of branches (if/else) tested
- Target: > 70%
- Catches edge cases line coverage misses

**Function Coverage:**

- Percentage of functions called by tests
- Target: > 90%
- Quick indicator of test breadth

**Running coverage:**

```bash
# Python with pytest-cov
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Python with coverage.py
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report -m
coverage html

# JavaScript with Jest
jest --coverage
```

### Gap Identification

Find untested code areas:

**Completely Untested Files:**

- Files with 0% coverage
- Often forgotten modules
- Priority: New features, critical paths

**Partially Tested Functions:**

- Functions with some but not all branches tested
- Missing edge cases
- Error handling paths

**Untested Code Patterns:**

```bash
# Show lines not covered
coverage report --show-missing

# List files below threshold
coverage report --fail-under=80

# JSON report for parsing
coverage json -o coverage.json
```

### Test Quality Assessment

Evaluate test effectiveness beyond coverage:

**Test-to-Code Ratio:**

- Lines of test / Lines of source
- Target: 1:1 to 2:1
- Low ratio may indicate insufficient testing

**Assertion Density:**

- Assertions per test function
- Target: > 1 per test
- Single assertion per concept (ideally)

**Test Independence:**

- Tests should not depend on each other
- No shared mutable state
- Proper setup/teardown

**Test Clarity:**

- Descriptive test names
- Clear arrange/act/assert structure
- Documented test purpose

## Coverage Analysis Workflow

### Full Coverage Analysis

1. **Run test suite**: Execute all tests with coverage
2. **Generate reports**: Create HTML and terminal reports
3. **Identify gaps**: Find untested files and lines
4. **Prioritize**: Rank gaps by risk and importance
5. **Recommend tests**: Suggest specific tests to add

### Quick Coverage Check

For rapid assessment:

1. Run coverage on changed files only
2. Compare to baseline coverage
3. Flag regressions
4. Report delta coverage

## Coverage Report Format

### Summary Report

```
Coverage Summary
================
Total Coverage: 78.5%
Target: 80.0%
Status: BELOW TARGET

By Component:
┌────────────────┬──────────┬────────┬─────────┐
│ Component      │ Lines    │ Missed │ Coverage│
├────────────────┼──────────┼────────┼─────────┤
│ api/           │ 450      │ 45     │ 90%     │
│ services/      │ 820      │ 180    │ 78%     │
│ repositories/  │ 320      │ 96     │ 70%     │
│ utils/         │ 150      │ 60     │ 60%     │
└────────────────┴──────────┴────────┴─────────┘
```

### Gap Analysis

```
Critical Gaps (Priority: High)
==============================
1. services/payment.py (45% coverage)
   - process_payment(): Lines 45-78 untested
   - refund_transaction(): Completely untested
   - Error handling: 0% coverage

2. repositories/user_repo.py (62% coverage)
   - delete_user(): Untested
   - bulk_update(): Partial coverage
```

### Test Recommendations

```
Recommended Tests
=================

1. test_payment_processing.py
   - test_successful_payment()
   - test_payment_insufficient_funds()
   - test_payment_network_error()
   - test_refund_full_amount()
   - test_refund_partial_amount()

2. test_user_repository.py
   - test_delete_user_success()
   - test_delete_user_not_found()
   - test_bulk_update_all_fields()
   - test_bulk_update_partial()
```

## Test Types and Strategies

### Unit Tests

**Coverage focus:**

- Individual functions/methods
- Edge cases and boundaries
- Error conditions

**Best practices:**

- Fast execution (< 100ms each)
- No external dependencies
- Use mocks/stubs for isolation

### Integration Tests

**Coverage focus:**

- Component interactions
- Database operations
- API endpoints

**Best practices:**

- Test real integrations
- Use test databases/containers
- Clean up after tests

### End-to-End Tests

**Coverage focus:**

- User workflows
- Critical paths
- System behavior

**Best practices:**

- Selective coverage (key flows)
- Realistic test data
- Stable test environment

## Coverage Configuration

### Python (pytest-cov)

```ini
# pytest.ini or pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = "--cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80"

[tool.coverage.run]
branch = true
source = ["src"]
omit = ["tests/*", "*/__pycache__/*"]

[tool.coverage.report]
exclude_lines = [
    "pragma: no cover",
    "if TYPE_CHECKING:",
    "raise NotImplementedError",
]
```

### JavaScript (Jest)

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "collectCoverage": true,
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "global": {
        "branches": 70,
        "functions": 80,
        "lines": 80,
        "statements": 80
      }
    },
    "coveragePathIgnorePatterns": [
      "/node_modules/",
      "/tests/"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Prioritization Framework

### Critical (Must Test)

- Payment/financial operations
- Authentication/authorization
- Data validation
- Security-sensitive code
- Core business logic

### Important (Should Test)

- User-facing features
- Data transformations
- External integrations
- Error handling paths

### Lower Priority

- Utility functions
- Configuration loading
- Logging code
- Debug/development code

## Common Coverage Issues

### False Sense of Security

**Problem:** High coverage but weak tests
**Solution:** Review assertion quality, test mutations

### Coverage Gaming

**Problem:** Tests that touch code without verifying behavior
**Solution:** Require meaningful assertions, code review

### Untestable Code

**Problem:** Code that's difficult to test
**Solution:** Refactor for testability, dependency injection

## Integration

Coordinate with other skills:

- **code-quality skill**: For test code quality
- **refactoring skill**: For improving testability
- **security-scanning skill**: For security test coverage
