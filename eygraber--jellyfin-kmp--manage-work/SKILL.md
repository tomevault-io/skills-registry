## Bulk Operations

### Prioritize Multiple Issues

When asked to prioritize or triage:
1. List relevant issues
2. Present summary to user
3. Apply priority labels as directed

### Sprint Planning

When asked to plan a sprint:
1. List backlog items
2. Help select items for sprint
3. Move selected to "Ready" column
4. Ensure priorities are set

## Common Workflows

### Triage New Issues
```
/manage-work list unlabeled
```
Then for each: add type, priority, and area labels.

### Check Sprint Status
```
/manage-work list in-progress
```
Shows what's actively being worked on.

### Groom Backlog
```
/manage-work list backlog
```
Review and prioritize items in backlog.

## Integration with Local Planning

When closing issues that have local `.projects/` plans:

1. **Closing a phase subissue**: Update the corresponding phase status in `.projects/<feature>/PLAN.md`
2. **Closing an epic**: Verify all local plan phases are complete, then archive (delete) `.projects/<feature>/`

When updating issues, check if there's a local plan that should also be updated:
```bash
# Check for local plan
ls .projects/
```

## Output Format

When listing issues, show:
```
#123 [P1] [feature] Title of the issue
     Labels: area:auth, type:feature, priority:p1
     Assignee: @username (or unassigned)

#124 [P2] [bug] Another issue title
     Labels: area:data, type:bug, priority:p2
     Assignee: unassigned
```

When updating, confirm:
```
Updated #123:
- Priority: P2 → P1
- Added label: area:auth
- Moved to: Ready
```
