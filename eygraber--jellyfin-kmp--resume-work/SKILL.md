### With Issue Number

When the user specifies an issue number:

1. **Fetch issue details:**
   ```bash
   gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER
   ```

2. **Check current status:**
   - If not In Progress, confirm with user before continuing
   - If closed/Done, inform user and suggest `/start-work` instead

3. **Check for local implementation plan:**
   Look in `.projects/` for plans referencing this issue.

4. **Display context to continue:**

   .claude/skills/start-work/scripts/list-project-items.sh --status in-progress
   ```

2. **If one item found:**
   Display it and confirm with user.
