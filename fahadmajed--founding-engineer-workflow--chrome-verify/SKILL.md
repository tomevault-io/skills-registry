# Chrome Verification

Two tools — pick based on need:

| Need                              | Tool                      | Context cost           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Verify pages look right (default) | Playwright library script | Low — just screenshots |
| Interactive debugging / exploring | Playwright MCP tools      | High — use sparingly   |

**Default to library scripts.** Only use MCP when you need a real-time see-think-act loop.

## Project Details

Customize for your project:

```
- Dev server: `{{YOUR_DEV_SERVER}}` (e.g., localhost:3000)
- Check: `lsof -i :{{PORT}} -sTCP:LISTEN`
- Login: {{YOUR_LOGIN_FLOW}}
- Playwright installed as dev dep with Chromium
```

## What to Verify

Focus on what's relevant to your change — not everything every time.

**Always check:**

- Does it look correct at desktop and mobile? Nothing overflowing or cut off?
- Does the change match the intent? No regressions in surrounding UI?

**If touching layout/styling:**

- Spacing rhythm consistent (not random padding values)
- Typography hierarchy clear
- Alignment — elements line up, tables/cards are even

**If touching RTL/i18n (if applicable):**

- Switch to RTL language and verify layout mirrors
- Logical properties working (no hardcoded left/right)
- Text reads naturally

**If touching data displays (tables, cards, charts):**

- Loading state (skeletons, spinners)
- Empty state (no data scenario)
- Long content — does text truncate with tooltip? Do numbers fit?

**If touching interactive elements:**

- Click/hover states work
- Disabled states look distinct
- Forms validate and show errors correctly

**Common gotchas:**

- Sidebar collapse behavior on smaller screens
- Sticky table headers/columns on scroll
- Currency/number formatting consistency
- Date formatting consistency
