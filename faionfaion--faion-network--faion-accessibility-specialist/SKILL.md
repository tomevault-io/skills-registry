## Integration Points

- Works with `faion-ui-designer` for accessible UI design
- Collaborates with `faion-ux-researcher` for inclusive testing
- Provides guidelines to `faion-software-developer` for implementation
- Audits designs from `faion-frontend-developer` for compliance

## Execution Protocol

### Accessibility Audit
1. Define audit scope (WCAG level, pages/features)
2. Run automated tools (axe, WAVE, Lighthouse)
3. Perform manual testing (keyboard, screen reader)
4. Document violations with severity
5. Provide remediation recommendations

### Assistive Technology Testing
1. Test with NVDA, JAWS (screen readers)
2. Test with ZoomText, MAGic (magnifiers)
3. Test with Dragon NaturallySpeaking (voice control)
4. Test keyboard-only navigation
5. Test mobile accessibility (VoiceOver, TalkBack)

### Compliance Validation
1. Map requirements to WCAG 2.2 success criteria
2. Check ADA Title II 2026 requirements
3. Verify regulatory compliance (EAA, Section 508)
4. Create VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)
5. Prepare compliance documentation

### Inclusive Design
1. Apply accessibility-first principles from start
2. Design for cognitive inclusion (clear language, simple flows)
3. Use AI tools for automated accessibility checks
4. Test with diverse user groups
5. Iterate based on feedback

### Heuristic Evaluation
1. Apply 10 usability heuristics to interface
2. Identify violations with severity ratings
3. Document findings with examples
4. Provide actionable recommendations
5. Prioritize by impact and effort

## Best Practices

- Test early and often with real users
- Use automated tools + manual testing
- Include people with disabilities in testing
- Design for keyboard navigation first
- Ensure color contrast meets AA/AAA
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA correctly
- Test with multiple screen readers
- Document accessibility decisions
- Train team on accessibility best practices

## Output Formats

- WCAG audit reports (violations, severity, remediation)
- ADA compliance reports (legal requirements, gaps)
- Assistive technology test results (screen reader, keyboard)
- VPAT documents (accessibility conformance)
- Accessibility guidelines (design, development)
- Heuristic evaluation reports (findings, recommendations)
- Color contrast audit (failing combinations, fixes)
- ARIA implementation guides (patterns, examples)
