# Backlog

Create a comprehensive backlog item for work we've explored but decided not to implement now.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Context

Ask these questions to understand what we're deferring:

1. **What feature/enhancement are we deferring?** (brief name)
2. **Why did we explore it?** (what problem does it solve)
3. **Why are we deferring?** (out of scope, lower priority, needs more info, etc.)
4. **What did we learn?** (key findings from exploration)

### Step 2: Determine Category (from filename suffix)

Choose the category and encode it in the filename suffix:

- **plan**: Comprehensive design for new features (most common for /backlog)
- **followup**: Post-merge improvements and tech debt
- **task-list**: Collection of related items
- **ideas**: Ideas to explore, not yet developed into actionable plans

Use filename format: `backlog/{task-name}-{category}.md`

Examples:
- `backlog/docs-r2-storage-plan.md`
- `backlog/session-cache-followups-task-list.md`

Notes:
- Task name should be kebab-case (`{task-name}`)
- Category is derived from suffix (`-{category}`), not frontmatter
- Status is derived from location: `backlog/` = pending, `backlog/done/` = done

### Step 3: Create Backlog File

Create a file at `backlog/{task-name}-{category}.md` with this structure:

```markdown
---
# Optional metadata only (omit keys you don't need)
topic: {slug-topic-name}
relates_to: {after:other-task-plan|until:other-task-plan}
priority: {1|2|3...} # 1 = highest priority
description: {short summary for UI/list views}
---

# {Feature Name}

## Problem Statement

{1-2 paragraphs explaining why this work matters and what problem it solves}

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| {decision point} | {what we'd choose} | {why} |

## Architecture

{ASCII diagram if helpful}

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: {Name}

**Files to modify:**
- `path/to/file.ts` - {what changes}

**Files to create:**
- `path/to/new-file.ts` - {purpose}

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] {testable outcome}
- [ ] {testable outcome}

### Phase 2: {Name}
...

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Commands to verify the implementation works
```

## Rollback Plan

{How to undo if things go wrong}

## References

- {Related files, PRs, docs, or external resources}
```

### Step 4: Include Research Artifacts

Incorporate what we learned during exploration:
- Code snippets we prototyped or found
- Configuration examples
- API patterns from existing code
- External documentation links

### Step 5: Commit

Commit the backlog file with message:
```
chore: add {feature} to backlog

{One sentence on what this enables}
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finishing, verify the backlog file:

- [ ] Has enough context that a fresh session can understand without the original conversation
- [ ] Includes specific file paths (with line numbers when relevant)
- [ ] Has verification commands or acceptance criteria
- [ ] References related code patterns in the codebase
- [ ] Uses minimal optional metadata only (`topic`, `relates_to`, `priority`, `description`) and omits unused keys
- [ ] Uses kebab-case filename suffix format: `{task-name}-{category}.md`

## List Backlog Items

To see all backlog items, run:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/backlog/scripts/status.sh
```

## Grooming

Detect stale or likely-completed backlog items that were never moved to `done/`.

```bash
~/.claude/skills/backlog/scripts/groom.sh [path/to/backlog]
```

The script cross-references pending items against git history (title/keyword matches and in-file references) and the filesystem (files that were supposed to be created). It flags items that look done so you can review and close them.

See `references/grooming.md` for the full grooming workflow and checklist.

## Example Usage

```
User: /backlog
Claude: I'll help capture the work we explored for future implementation.

What feature/enhancement are we deferring?
> R2 storage for docs assets

Why did we explore it?
> Docs screenshots are gitignored, wanted persistent storage without git bloat

Why are we deferring?
> Works fine locally for now, R2 adds complexity we don't need yet

What did we learn?
> R2 bindings in wrangler.jsonc, Worker route pattern, wrangler CLI for uploads

[Creates backlog/docs-r2-storage-plan.md with full implementation plan]
```
