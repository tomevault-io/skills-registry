# Frontend Design Principles

Use this skill to reason about the "why" behind design decisions. It complements implementation guidance by grounding choices in UX, visual, accessibility, and systems thinking.

## Quick Start

When asked to design, critique, or document a frontend UI:
1. Identify the primary domain (UX, visual, accessibility, systems)
2. Surface the most relevant principles
3. Explain why a principle applies and how it informs the decision
4. Acknowledge tradeoffs

## Core Meta-Principles

These principles transcend individual domains:

**Design is invisible when it works.** The goal is removing friction between users and their goals, not being noticed. Evaluate: "Does this call attention to itself or to the user's task?"

**Constraints enable creativity.** Limitations (mobile-first, accessibility requirements, brand guidelines) focus rather than restrict. Treat constraints as creative prompts.

**Systems thinking precedes component thinking.** The whole shapes the parts. Understand the ecosystem before designing individual elements.

**Process matters as much as outcome.** How work happens (inclusive design, iteration, testing) shapes what gets delivered.

## UX & Interaction Principles

**The Gulf of Execution & Evaluation** (Norman): Users bridge two gaps—from intention to action (execution) and from system state to understanding (evaluation). Good design minimizes both gulfs through clear affordances and feedback.

**Don't Make Me Think** (Krug): Every question mark adds cognitive load. Users satisfice (choose first reasonable option) rather than optimize. Reduce decisions, not clicks.

**Recognition Over Recall** (Nielsen): Make elements visible rather than requiring users to remember them. Menus beat command lines for novices.

**Jakob's Law**: Users spend most time on *other* sites. Leverage conventions; break them only with clear benefit.

**Mental Models Over Implementation Models** (Cooper): Interfaces should mirror how users think about tasks, not how systems work internally.

**Perpetual Intermediates**: Most users are neither beginners nor experts. Design must grow with users rather than optimizing for extremes.

For Nielsen's 10 Heuristics and detailed frameworks, see `references/evaluation-frameworks.md`.

## Visual Design Principles

**Data-Ink Ratio** (Tufte): Maximize ink representing actual information; minimize decoration. Applies beyond charts—every pixel should earn its place.

**Color is Relational** (Albers): The same hue appears different in different contexts. Test colors in context, not isolation.

**Typography Exists to Honor Content** (Bringhurst): Design subordinates to message. When in doubt, increase readability.

**Grids Enable, Not Constrain** (Muller-Brockmann): Grids create proportional relationships that guide attention. The grid is "an aid, not a guarantee."

**Modular Scales**: Use mathematical ratios (golden section 1.618, perfect fifth 1.5) for harmonious type sizes and spacing rather than arbitrary values.

**Visual Hierarchy Through Contrast**: Size, color, weight, and position create hierarchy. When everything screams for attention, nothing does.

For spacing systems, typography details, and hierarchy patterns, see `references/visual-systems.md`.

## Accessibility Principles

**Disability is a Mismatch** (Holmes): Disability exists at the intersection of person and environment—design creates mismatches, design can remedy them.

**The Persona Spectrum**: Permanent, temporary, and situational disabilities face the same design challenges. A permanently deaf person, someone with an ear infection, and someone in a loud bar all need captions.

**Solve for One, Extend to Many**: Design for permanent disabilities often benefits everyone (the curb cut effect).

**Accessibility is Outcome; Inclusive Design is Process** (Featherstone): You can achieve technical compliance without consulting disabled users, but process matters—it demonstrates values.

**Born Accessible** (Horton): Technology should be accessible from inception, not retrofitted. Retrofits are costly and produce inferior experiences.

**Design With, Not For**: Cast disabled users as co-designers, not test subjects. Disability simulations substitute poorly for consultation.

For WCAG principles, common errors, and testing approaches, see `references/accessibility-guide.md`.

## Design Systems Principles

**Build Systems, Not Pages** (Frost): Interface design creates interconnected components, not individual layouts. Atomic design (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages) provides compositional thinking.

**A System is a Product Serving Products** (Curtis): Systems require ongoing investment, not one-time builds. They solve easy problems so products can solve hard ones.

**Functional vs. Perceptual Patterns** (Kholmatova): Distinguish what a component does from how it looks/feels. Both need systematic treatment.

**Design Tokens**: Separate raw values from semantic meaning. Base tokens (colors, sizes) feed semantic tokens (primary-action, error-state) enabling theming and systematic updates.

**Be Consistent, Not Uniform** (Hupe): Use same patterns for familiarity while acknowledging context. Consistency is outcome, not goal.

**Systems Can Scale Harm**: If systems industrialize decisions, they can also industrialize discrimination. Evaluate what you're scaling.

For governance models, token architecture, and pitfall patterns, see `references/design-systems-guide.md`.

## Applying Principles

When evaluating or creating designs:

1. **Identify the domain**: Is this primarily a UX problem, visual problem, accessibility problem, or systems problem? Often multiple.
2. **Surface the relevant principles**: Which concepts apply? Principles often tension against each other—that's where interesting design decisions live.
3. **Reason from principles**: Don't apply mechanically. Explain *why* a principle applies and *how* it informs the decision.
4. **Acknowledge tradeoffs**: Good design principles help articulate what you're trading off, not eliminate tradeoffs.

When critiquing designs, see `references/common-pitfalls.md` for domain-specific gotchas practitioners commonly encounter.
