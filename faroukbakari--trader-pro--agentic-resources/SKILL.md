# Agentic Resources — Discover Prompts, Agents, Skills & MCP Tools

Structured reference of the best online sources for finding reusable AI coding assets across the agentic ecosystem. Covers official vendor resources, community-maintained marketplaces, CLI tools, and MCP server registries — with assessment criteria and usage patterns.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Searching for existing skills, agents, or MCP tools before building custom ones
- Evaluating which marketplace or registry to query for a specific need
- Installing community skills into the workspace
- Recommending external resources to users exploring the agentic ecosystem
- Deciding between multiple skill/tool sources for the same capability
- Onboarding new team members to the agentic tooling landscape

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Source Selection

Given a search need, pick the right source:

| Looking For | Primary Source | Secondary Source | CLI Shortcut |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| MCP server to wrap an API | MCP Official Registry | mcp.so, Smithery | `mcp-registry` MCP server |
| Reusable coding skill | SkillsMP marketplace | davila7/claude-code-templates | `npx skills find <query>` |
| Prompt template | Anthropic Prompt Library | SkillsMP (`prompt-engineering`) | — |
| Agent definition reference | cursor.directory | VS Code agent mode docs | — |
| Claude-specific skill | davila7/claude-code-templates | mrgoonie/claudekit-skills | `npx skills add davila7/claude-code-templates` |

### Phase 2: Evaluate Before Installing

Not every skill or tool is worth adding. Apply assessment criteria:

| Factor | Install | Skip |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Relevance** | Directly matches a recurring task | Tangentially related |
| **Quality** | High stars, active maintenance, clear docs | No stars, abandoned, unclear |
| **Overlap** | No existing skill covers this | Already covered by workspace skills |
| **Portability** | Agent-agnostic, no hard dependencies | Tied to specific agent framework |
| **Size** | Focused, <200 lines | Bloated, kitchen-sink approach |

### Phase 3: Install and Verify

**Skills from GitHub repos:**
```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo>           # Interactive — pick skills to install
npx skills add <owner/repo> -y        # Auto-accept all
npx skills add <owner/repo> -g        # Install globally (user-level)
```

**MCP servers:**
```jsonc
// .vscode/mcp.json — add stdio servers
{
  "servers": {
    "<name>": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["<package-name>"]
    }
  }
}

// Remote servers (no install)
{
  "servers": {
    "<name>": {
      "type": "http",        // VS Code uses "http" for streamable-http
      "url": "<server-url>"
    }
  }
}
```

**Verify after install:**
- Skills: check they appear in `.github/skills/` or agent's skill references
- MCP servers: VS Code Output → MCP panel → confirm "Running" state

## Known API Endpoints

Working APIs discovered during research that can be queried directly:

| API | Endpoint | Returns |
|-----|----------|---------|
| **skills.sh** | `GET https://skills.sh/api/search?q={query}` | `{ skills: [{ id, skillId, name, installs, source }], count }` |
| **MCP Registry** | `GET https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search={query}&limit=N` | Server list with packages, transports, metadata |
| **SkillsMP** | Via `skillsmp-mcp-server` MCP tools | Search, AI search, get content, install, list repo skills |

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Installing everything** — Skills bloat context. Install only what you'll use regularly.
- **Ignoring overlap** — Check workspace skills before adding external ones. Duplicates waste context budget.
- **Trusting star count alone** — High stars often reflect the repo's popularity, not the individual skill's quality. Read the actual SKILL.md.
- **Using `streamable-http` in VS Code config** — VS Code expects `"type": "http"`, not `"streamable-http"`. The registry uses different transport labels than VS Code's config schema.
- **Assuming remote MCP servers are reliable** — Community-hosted remote servers go down. Prefer stdio (local) for critical tools.

---

## Output Format

When recommending resources to a user:

```markdown
### Recommended Resources for {task}

| Resource | Why | Install |
|----------|-----|---------|
| {name} | {relevance to task} | {install command or URL} |
```
