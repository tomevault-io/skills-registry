description: Cognitive effort calibration. Selects reasoning depth (from direct response to adversarial self-correction) based on task complexity. Use when designing methodology, writing reasoning directives, or calibrating thinking effort for prompts / feedbacks / balancings / evaluations / root cause analysis / high level designs / introspections / self challenges. Use when this capability is needed.

# Reasoning Strategy

Techniques for calibrating **cognitive effort** in agent-authored prompts and methodologies. Maps task complexity to the appropriate reasoning depth — preventing both over-thinking (wasted tokens on simple tasks) and under-thinking (shallow responses on complex problems).

**Scope boundary**: This skill covers tier *selection* (which level of reasoning effort). For directive *execution quality* (phrasing, format, timing, chain length), apply `reasoning-calibration`. For model-specific *behavioral guards*, apply `sonnet-prompting` or `haiku-prompting`.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing a new agent's `<methodology>` section — selecting reasoning depth
- Writing prompts that require structured analysis
- Reviewing an agent that produces shallow or sycophantic responses
- Calibrating effort for different task types within a single agent
- Injecting self-correction into high-stakes decision workflows

## The Reasoning Tier Model

Five tiers of cognitive effort, grounded in research on Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al. 2022), Tree-of-Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023), and Anthropic's think-tool benchmarks (2025).

### Tier Overview

| Tier | Name | Effort | When | Token Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T0** | Direct | None | Known answers, lookups, simple actions | Baseline |
| **T1** | Linear CoT | Low | Single-domain reasoning, standard implementation | +10-20% |
| **T2** | Structured Decomposition | Medium | Multi-factor decisions, design choices | +30-50% |
| **T3** | Inter-Action Deliberation | High | Multi-step tool workflows, policy-heavy decisions | +40-60% |
| **T4** | Adversarial Self-Correction | Very High | Ambiguous/high-stakes, architectural decisions | +50-80% |

### Selection Decision Table

```
Is the answer already known or easily looked up?
  └── YES → T0 (Direct)

Does it require reasoning but in a single domain?
  └── YES → T1 (Linear CoT)

Does it involve tradeoffs across multiple dimensions?
  └── YES → T2 (Structured Decomposition)

Does it span multiple tool calls where mistakes compound?
  └── YES → T3 (Inter-Action Deliberation)

Is the outcome ambiguous, high-stakes, or prone to bias?
  └── YES → T4 (Adversarial Self-Correction)
```

## Mapping Agent Types to Tiers

| Agent Archetype | Default Tier | Escalate To | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Research / extraction | T0-T1 | T2 if synthesizing | Mostly retrieval, minimal reasoning |
| Implementation / coding | T1 | T3 if multi-file | Linear reasoning sufficient for code tasks |
| Testing | T1-T2 | T3 for test strategy | Coverage analysis needs structured thinking |
| Code review | T2 | T4 for security review | Multi-perspective analysis is core activity |
| Planning | T2-T3 | T4 for ambiguous scope | Tradeoff analysis + inter-step deliberation |
| Architecture study | T2-T3 | T4 for recommendations | Multi-perspective + adversarial challenge |
| RCA / debugging | T3 | T4 for elusive bugs | Hypothesis-driven needs inter-action reasoning |
| Orchestration / coordination | T2 | T3 for delegation decisions | Structured decomposition of task routing |

### Dynamic Tier Escalation

Within a single agent session, tier can escalate based on signals:

```
Initial attempt failed or produced low-confidence result?
  → Escalate one tier

Multiple contradictory evidence found?
  → Escalate to T4 (adversarial)

User explicitly asks "are you sure?" or "think harder"?
  → Escalate one tier

Task turns out simpler than expected?
  → De-escalate to save tokens
```

## Integration Patterns

### For Agent Authors (ia-coord)

When creating or reviewing an agent, select the default reasoning tier:

1. **Identify the agent's primary task type** from the mapping table
2. **Set the default tier** in the agent's methodology section
3. **Add escalation triggers** if the agent handles variable-complexity tasks
4. **Inject the corresponding pattern** from the tier patterns above

### For Prompt Authors

When writing prompts that need reasoning:

1. **Assess task complexity** using the selection decision table
2. **Embed the appropriate pattern** as `<reasoning_style>` or `<reasoning_guidance>`
3. **Avoid over-specifying** — T0/T1 tasks need no reasoning directive

### For Methodology Sections

Embed reasoning at the phase level, not globally:

```markdown
<!-- ✅ GOOD: tier-appropriate per phase -->
### Phase 1: Discovery (T0 — direct)
Search for relevant files.

### Phase 2: Analysis (T2 — structured)
Analyze findings from at least 3 perspectives before recommending.

### Phase 3: Decision (T4 — adversarial)
Challenge your recommendation before presenting it.
```

```markdown
<!-- ❌ BAD: blanket reasoning mandate -->
Always think deeply about everything using multi-perspective analysis
with first-principles breakdown and counter-arguments.
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Blanket "think hard"** | Wastes tokens on simple tasks, adds latency | Tier-match: T0 for lookups, T4 for ambiguity |
| **Reasoning without structure** | "Think about it" produces shallow, linear output | Use named categories: perspectives, first-principles, counter-arguments |
| **Over-reasoning on knowns** | Reasoning about well-established facts | Skip to T0 (direct) for known answers |
| **Missing self-correction** | High-stakes decisions without challenge step | Add T4 adversarial loop for critical decisions |
| **Sycophantic agreement** | Accepting user's premise without examination | Add counter-argument directive: "challenge the initial assumption" |
| **Reasoning divorced from action** | Extensive analysis without actionable conclusion | Always end reasoning with a concrete decision or next action |
| **Static tier** | Same reasoning depth for all tasks in an agent | Add escalation/de-escalation triggers |
