# UX Design Patterns

Actionable UX design patterns grounded in cognitive psychology — Gestalt perception, Fitts' & Hick's Laws, cognitive load theory, flow state engineering, and ADHD-friendly design. Apply these while writing code to build interfaces that feel effortless.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Building interactive components (forms, modals, menus, dashboards)
- Reviewing UI code for friction points
- Designing loading, error, and empty states
- Laying out controls, buttons, and navigation
- Optimizing data-dense interfaces (tables, charts, panels)
- Deciding progressive disclosure vs. upfront display

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Cognitive Load Assessment

Three types of mental load — eliminate the one you control:

| Type | Definition | Your Job |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Intrinsic** | Task complexity itself | Can't eliminate — acknowledge it |
| **Extraneous** | Poor design adding effort | **ELIMINATE THIS** |
| **Germane** | Learning/understanding | Minimize for repeat users |

**Working memory limits (Miller's Law):**
- 7 ± 2 items maximum in working memory
- 4 chunks optimal for complex tasks
- Group related controls; never show >7 options without categorization

**Reduction strategies:**
- Use **recognition over recall** — show options, don't expect users to remember them
- Provide **smart defaults** — pre-fill the most common choice
- Apply **progressive disclosure** — show one level of complexity at a time, reveal more on demand
- Remove **decorative noise** — every element that doesn't inform competes with those that do

### Phase 2: Gestalt Perception Principles

How humans perceive visual grouping — use these to communicate structure without labels:

**Proximity** — elements close together are perceived as related:
```
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│ Related │  │ Related │     │ Other   │  │ Other   │
│ Item A  │  │ Item B  │     │ Group A │  │ Group B │
└─────────┘  └─────────┘     └─────────┘  └─────────┘
     ↑ CLOSE = grouped            ↑ SEPARATE = distinct
```
- Group related form fields with shared whitespace boundaries
- Separate unrelated sections with meaningful gaps (not lines)

**Similarity** — same color/shape/size = perceived as same function:
```
┌──────┐  ┌──────┐  ┌──────┐     ┌──────┐  ┌──────┐
│ BLUE │  │ BLUE │  │ BLUE │     │ RED  │  │ RED  │
│ Save │  │ Copy │  │ Edit │     │ Del  │  │ Clear│
└──────┘  └──────┘  └──────┘     └──────┘  └──────┘
     ↑ Same style = safe actions       ↑ Different = destructive
```
- Use consistent styling for actions of the same class
- Visually differentiate destructive actions from safe ones

**Continuity** — the eye follows lines and paths naturally:
```
Step 1 ──→ Step 2 ──→ Step 3 ──→ Complete
   ●──────────●──────────●──────────●
```
- Align multi-step flows horizontally or vertically — never zigzag
- Use visual connectors (lines, arrows, progress bars) between steps

**Closure** — the brain completes incomplete shapes:
```
[ ████████░░░░░░░░ ] 50% — brain "sees" the end
```
- Progress bars leverage closure — users mentally project completion
- Partially visible cards imply more content beyond the fold

### Phase 3: Interaction Sizing (Fitts' Law)

Time to reach a target = f(Distance / Size). Larger + closer = faster.

**Minimum touch/click target sizes:**

| Platform | Minimum | Preferred |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| iOS | 44 × 44 px | 48 × 48 px |
| Android | 48 × 48 px | 56 × 56 px |
| Desktop | 32 × 32 px | 44 × 44 px |

**Layout rules:**
- **Primary action** → largest button, most prominent position
- **Destructive actions** → smaller, separated from primary path (never adjacent to confirm)
- **Icon + label > icon alone** → larger target area + reduced ambiguity
- **Edge targets are infinite** — place critical actions at screen edges/corners (can't overshoot)
- **Context menus** appear at cursor → zero travel distance

```
❌  [ Delete ]  [ Confirm ]     ← Adjacent destructive + primary
✅  [ Confirm ]          [ Delete ]  ← Separated, different size
```

### Phase 4: Decision Reduction (Hick's Law)

Decision time increases logarithmically with the number of choices.

**Rules:**
- ≤ 5 primary actions visible at once — hide rest behind "More" or progressive disclosure
- Highlight the **recommended option** to short-circuit decision time
- Use **categorized groups** for long lists (tabs, sections, filters)
- Provide **search** for any list > 15 items
- **Smart defaults** eliminate decisions entirely — pre-select the 80% case

**Decision hierarchy pattern:**
```
Primary:    [ Place Order ]          ← One clear CTA
Secondary:  [ Save Draft ] [ Cancel ] ← Supporting actions
Tertiary:   More options ▾            ← Everything else hidden
```

### Phase 5: Feedback & State Communication

Every user action needs acknowledgment. Silence breeds uncertainty.

**Response time thresholds:**

| Delay | User Perception | Required Feedback |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| < 100ms | Instant | None needed |
| 100ms – 1s | Noticeable | Subtle indicator (spinner, pulse) |
| 1s – 10s | Waiting | Progress bar, skeleton screen |
| > 10s | Leaving | Progress %, background processing with notification |

**State coverage checklist — every async component needs all five:**
- **Loading** — skeleton screens preferred over spinners (preserves layout)
- **Empty** — guide toward first action ("No orders yet. Place your first order →")
- **Error** — actionable message + recovery action ("Connection lost. [Retry]")
- **Partial** — some data loaded, some still pending (show what you have)
- **Success** — confirm completion briefly (toast, checkmark animation)

**Optimistic UI:**
- Execute visually before server confirms — rollback on error
- Creates perception of instant response
- Use for: toggles, list reordering, simple CRUD
- Avoid for: financial transactions, irreversible actions

### Phase 6: Flow State Preservation

Flow requires: clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge-skill balance, no failure anxiety.

**Rules to preserve flow:**
- **Never block UI** for operations > 1 second — process in background
- **Auto-save** everything — eliminate "save anxiety"
- **Undo everything** — confidence to experiment requires reversibility
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users — `Ctrl+Enter` for primary action, `Escape` for cancel
- **Re-orientation after interruption** — "Welcome back" panel showing last state and next action
- **Minimize mode switches** — every context switch costs 23 minutes of focus recovery

**Interruption cost matrix:**

| Interruption Type | Recovery Time | Mitigation |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| Modal dialog (blocks flow) | 15-30s | Use inline messages or toasts instead |
| Full page navigation | 5-15s | Use panels, drawers, or inline expansion |
| Confirmation dialog | 3-10s | Use undo pattern instead ("3 items deleted. [Undo]") |
| Toast notification | 1-2s | Minimal cost — preferred for non-critical feedback |

### Phase 7: ADHD-Friendly Design

Patterns that benefit neurodivergent users — and improve experience for everyone:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Progressive disclosure** | Show one task at a time; hide future steps |
| **Context preservation** | Auto-save every keystroke; never lose work |
| **Gentle feedback** | Status updates, not alarms; no aggressive red urgency |
| **Pause & resume** | Session state persists across days/weeks |
| **Minimal distractions** | Single focus area; dim non-active panels |
| **Chunked progress** | Visual cards/steps, not endless scrolling |
| **Predictable layout** | Same layout always; no layout shifts or surprises |
| **Calm mode option** | Reduced animations, muted colors on demand |

## Friction Audit Checklist

Run this against any component or flow before shipping:

### Cognitive Load
- [ ] User can complete the task with ≤ 4 things in working memory
- [ ] No unnecessary choices — defaults handle the 80% case
- [ ] Recognition over recall — options are visible, not memorized
- [ ] Information hierarchy is clear — primary content dominates

### Interaction Design
- [ ] Primary buttons ≥ 44px tall with sufficient padding
- [ ] Destructive actions are visually distinct and separated from primary path
- [ ] Labels on buttons, not just icons (icon-only acceptable only with tooltip)
- [ ] Related controls are grouped with proximity, not with borders

### Feedback
- [ ] Every async action has loading, error, empty, and success states
- [ ] No action blocks the UI for > 2 seconds without progress indication
- [ ] Error messages are actionable — they say what went wrong AND what to do
- [ ] Success confirmation is brief and non-blocking (toast or inline)

### Flow
- [ ] Auto-save prevents data loss
- [ ] Every destructive action is undoable (prefer undo over confirmation dialogs)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts exist for frequent actions
- [ ] No unnecessary page reloads or full navigations

### Decision Architecture
- [ ] ≤ 5 primary options visible at once
- [ ] Recommended option is visually highlighted
- [ ] Long lists have search/filter (> 15 items)
- [ ] Steps show progress ("Step 2 of 4")

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ **Confirmation fatigue** — "Are you sure?" dialogs for every action. Use undo instead.
- ❌ **Mystery meat navigation** — Icon-only buttons without labels or tooltips
- ❌ **Error tombstones** — "Something went wrong" with no recovery action
- ❌ **Layout thrashing** — Content shifting as async data loads (use skeleton screens)
- ❌ **Choice overload** — Showing 20+ options without grouping or search
- ❌ **Split attention** — Error messages far from the field that caused them
- ❌ **Modal abuse** — Using modals for information that could be inline
- ❌ **Silent failures** — Operations that fail without any visible feedback
- ✅ **Calm confidence** — Clear state, immediate feedback, easy reversal, predictable layout
