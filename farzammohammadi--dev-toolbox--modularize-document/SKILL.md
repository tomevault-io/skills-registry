# Philosophy

**Large documents are hard to navigate and maintain.**

Breaking them into focused, linked modules improves both readability and maintainability.

---

## Core Principle: Ask When Unsure

**When in doubt, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm with the user.**

This ensures the highest quality outcome. Never make assumptions about:
- Which pattern defines sections
- How the user wants files organized
- Whether detected sections are correct
- Any ambiguous aspect of the document

The `AskUserQuestion` tool is your primary mechanism for maintaining quality.

---

## Input/Output

**Input**: Single markdown file with multiple sections (any consistent pattern)

**Output**:
1. Original file → Clean index with title, intro, linked section list
2. Each section → Numbered file (`1-section-name.md`, `2-section-name.md`, etc.)

---

## Usage

Invoke with any markdown file path:
- `/modularize-document /path/to/document.md`
- `/modularize-document ./relative/path/doc.md`

Detail files are created based on user's chosen output structure.

---

## Section Detection

Analyze the document to detect logical sections using **any consistent pattern**:

- `##` headings (most common)
- `#` headings (if multiple top-level headings exist)
- Numbered headings (`1.`, `2.`, `1)`, etc.)
- Bold text used as section headers (`**Section Name**`)
- Horizontal rules (`---`) as dividers
- Any other consistent structural pattern

**Do NOT hardcode** to only look for `##`. Adapt to whatever structure the document uses.

---

## Output Structures

### Option A - Flat (same directory)
All detail files in the same directory as the original:
```
original-dir/
├── document.md (becomes index)
├── 1-introduction.md
├── 2-core-concepts.md
└── 3-api-reference.md
```

Links: `[Section Name](./1-section-name.md)`

### Option B - Nested (subdirectory per section)
Each section gets its own subdirectory:
```
original-dir/
├── document.md (becomes index)
├── 1-introduction/
│   └── 1-introduction.md
├── 2-core-concepts/
│   └── 2-core-concepts.md
└── 3-api-reference/
    └── 3-api-reference.md
```

Links: `[Section Name](./1-section-name/1-section-name.md)`

---

## Index File Structure

- Title (from original `#` heading or document start)
- Brief intro sentence (if present before first section)
- Sections as linked headers: `### [1. Section Name](./path-to-file.md)`
- 2-3 sentence description per section

---

## Detail File Structure

- `# Section Name` (promoted to top-level heading)
- Full original content preserved
- All subsections kept intact
- Self-contained and readable standalone

---

## Workflow

**Input**: File path to a markdown document

```
1. ANALYZE
   - Read the file
   - Detect section boundaries (adapt to document's pattern, not just ##)
   - Identify title and any intro text before first section

2. CONFIRM SECTIONS (use AskUserQuestion)
   - Present detected sections to user:
     "I found N sections in this document:
      1. First Section
      2. Second Section
      3. Third Section
      Does this look right?"
   - Options: "Yes, proceed" / "Let me adjust"
   - If uncertain about detection pattern, ask for clarification

3. CHOOSE OUTPUT STRUCTURE (use AskUserQuestion)
   - Ask user: "How should the output be organized?"
   - Options:
     - Flat: All files in same directory
     - Nested: Each section gets its own subdirectory

4. GENERATE DETAIL FILES
   - For each section:
     - Create numbered file (1-kebab-name.md, 2-kebab-name.md...)
     - If nested: create subdirectory first
     - Promote section heading to #
     - Include all content until next section or EOF

5. TRANSFORM INDEX
   - Keep original file as index
   - Retain title and intro
   - Replace sections with linked list + brief descriptions
   - Use correct link format based on chosen structure

6. REPORT
   - Output structure used
   - Files created
   - Content preserved confirmation
```

---

## Filename Convention

Convert section titles to kebab-case:
- "Core Concepts" → `1-core-concepts.md`
- "API Reference & Examples" → `2-api-reference-and-examples.md`
- "Getting Started" → `3-getting-started.md`

---

## User Interaction Guidelines

**Asking is the default, not a fallback.** Quality comes from confirmation, not assumptions.

**Always use `AskUserQuestion` for:**
- Confirming detected sections are correct
- Choosing between flat and nested output structures
- Section detection is ambiguous (multiple possible patterns)
- Only 1 section found (ask if they still want to proceed)
- Any uncertainty about document structure

**The bar for "uncertainty" is low** - if you're even slightly unsure, ask. A quick question prevents incorrect output that wastes user time.

---

## Constraints

- **Never lose content** - All section content goes into detail files
- **Preserve subsections** - Nested headings stay within their parent detail file
- **Use kebab-case** - Filenames derived from section titles
- **Relative paths** - Links use `./` prefix
- **Maintain order** - Numbering reflects original document order
- **Adapt detection** - Use whatever section pattern the document follows
- **Handle edge cases**:
  - No sections found → Report "nothing to modularize" and exit without changes
  - Only 1 section → Ask user if they still want to proceed
  - Ambiguous structure → Ask user to clarify which pattern to use
