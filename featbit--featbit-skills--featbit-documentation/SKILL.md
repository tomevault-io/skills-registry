description: FeatBit documentation router that provides likely relevant docs.featbit.co URLs when other FeatBit skills cannot fully answer. Use when user asks about FeatBit features, concepts, deployment, SDKs, API, integrations, or architecture and the response should point to official documentation for deeper detail. Do not use when another FeatBit skill already provides a complete answer. Use when this capability is needed.

# FeatBit Documentation Router

This skill is a **fallback** for FeatBit questions. Use it **only after** other FeatBit skills do not provide a complete answer. Its job is to return a short list of **likely relevant documentation URLs** so the agent can open those pages and extract the final details.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- A FeatBit question is not fully answered by more specific FeatBit skills.
- The request requires authoritative details from FeatBit docs.
- The best next step is to point the agent to official documentation URLs.

Do **not** use this skill when another FeatBit skill already provides a full answer.

## Output Rules (Critical)

1. **Return URLs only** (plus a brief 1-line rationale per URL).
2. **Prefer docs.featbit.co URLs** from the documentation index.
3. Provide **3–7 URLs max**, ranked by relevance.
4. If a GitHub repo is more authoritative than docs, include it **in addition** to docs URLs.

## Quick Navigation Guide

FeatBit documentation is organized into 12 main sections. Use the topic keywords below to identify relevant areas, then consult the complete index for specific URLs.

**Complete Documentation Index**: [references/complete-documentation-index.md](references/complete-documentation-index.md)  
Contains all 75 documentation URLs with detailed summaries. Reference this when you need specific page URLs.

## Usage Example

**User query**: "How do I gradually roll out a feature to 20% of users?"

**Your response**:
```
Here are the relevant documentation pages:

1. https://docs.featbit.co/feature-flags/targeting-users-with-flags/percentage-rollouts - Primary guide for percentage-based rollouts
2. https://docs.featbit.co/feature-flags/targeting-users-with-flags/targeting-rules - Understanding targeting rules structure
3. https://docs.featbit.co/feature-flags/create-flag-variations - How to set up flag variations

These pages explain how to enable percentage rollouts within targeting rules to serve features to a specified percentage of users with consistent assignment.
