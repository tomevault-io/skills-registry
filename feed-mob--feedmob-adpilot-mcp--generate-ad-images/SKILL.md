# Generate Ad Images

Generate two distinct image variations for advertising campaigns using Google Gemini API. Each variation should be visually distinct, platform-optimized, and aligned with campaign goals.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Campaign Context

Extract from provided parameters:
- **product_or_service**: What is being advertised
- **target_audience**: Who the ad targets
- **platform**: Where ad appears (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)
- **creative_direction**: Tone and style requirements
- **kpi**: Success metrics

If research insights provided, incorporate audience behaviors, platform trends, and creative recommendations.

### Step 2: Determine Dimensions

Select dimensions based on platform. See [references/platform-guidelines.md](references/platform-guidelines.md) for full details.

| Platform | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| TikTok | 1080×1920 | 9:16 |
| Instagram Feed | 1080×1080 | 1:1 |
| Instagram Story | 1080×1920 | 9:16 |
| Facebook Feed | 1200×628 | 1.91:1 |
| LinkedIn | 1200×627 | 1.91:1 |

Default to 1080×1080 if no platform specified.

### Step 3: Create Variation A Prompt

Build a detailed image generation prompt including:
- Product/service representation
- Target audience representation (if appropriate)
- Platform-appropriate composition
- Style matching creative direction
- Dimensions specification
- "No text overlays" instruction
- "Leave space for text" instruction

### Step 4: Execute Script for Variation A

Run the Python script:

```bash
python scripts/generate_image.py --prompt "[your prompt]" --variation "A" --aspect-ratio "[ratio]"
```

Aspect ratio options: `1:1`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `9:16`, `16:9`

The script returns JSON with `image_data` (base64), `mime_type`, and `variation_id`.

### Step 5: Create Variation B Prompt

Create a DISTINCT prompt with different:
- Composition or angle
- Visual style or mood
- Focus or emphasis

Variation B must NOT be a minor variation of A. Provide genuine alternative for A/B testing.

### Step 6: Execute Script for Variation B

```bash
python scripts/generate_image.py --prompt "[your prompt]" --variation "B" --aspect-ratio "[ratio]"
```

### Step 7: Determine Recommendation

Analyze both variations and recommend one based on:
- Campaign KPI alignment
- Platform best practices
- Audience appeal from insights

### Step 8: Return JSON Output

**CRITICAL**: Return a raw JSON object as plain text (NOT wrapped in markdown code blocks like \`\`\`json). The output must be valid JSON that can be parsed directly by the calling service.

Return this exact structure:

{
  "generated_at": "ISO timestamp (e.g., 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z)",
  "campaign_name": "name or null",
  "platform": "platform name (lowercase, e.g., tiktok, instagram_feed)",
  "target_audience": "audience description",
  "variations": [
    {
      "variation_id": "A",
      "image_url": "URL from script output (required)",
      "thumbnail_url": "thumbnail URL from script or null",
      "file_id": "file ID from script or null",
      "mime_type": "image/png or image/jpeg",
      "prompt_used": "full prompt used for generation",
      "visual_approach": "brief description of visual approach (1-2 sentences)",
      "dimensions": { "width": 1080, "height": 1920 }
    },
    {
      "variation_id": "B",
      "image_url": "URL from script output (required)",
      "thumbnail_url": "thumbnail URL from script or null",
      "file_id": "file ID from script or null",
      "mime_type": "image/png or image/jpeg",
      "prompt_used": "full prompt used for generation",
      "visual_approach": "brief description of visual approach (1-2 sentences)",
      "dimensions": { "width": 1080, "height": 1920 }
    }
  ],
  "recommended_variation": "A or B",
  "recommendation_rationale": "2-3 sentences explaining why this variation is recommended based on campaign goals, platform best practices, and audience appeal"
}

## Important Notes

- Return raw JSON only, not wrapped in code blocks
- Generate exactly two variations with distinct visual approaches
- Ensure images are platform-optimized with correct dimensions
- Leave space for text overlays (headlines, CTAs)
- Avoid text, logos, or copyrighted elements in generated images
- Match tone and style to creative direction
- Provide clear rationale for recommendation
- Ensure variation B is genuinely different from A
