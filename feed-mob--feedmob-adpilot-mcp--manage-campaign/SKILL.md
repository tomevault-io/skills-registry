# Manage Campaign

## Overview

Retrieve and manage advertising campaign state. Campaigns progress through a defined workflow: parameters → research → ad copy → images → mixed media. This skill helps track progress and determine next steps.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Retrieving campaign data by ID
- Checking campaign completion status
- Determining next workflow step
- Viewing stored campaign parameters, research, or assets
- Understanding what components are complete or pending

## Campaign Lifecycle

Campaigns follow this workflow:

```
1. parseAdRequirements → Creates campaign with parameters
2. conductAdResearch → Adds research report
3. generateAdCopy → Adds ad copy variations (A/B)
4. generateAdImages → Adds image variations (A/B)
5. generateMixedMedia → Creates final composite
```

Each step stores results in the campaign record.

## Campaign Data Structure

A campaign contains:

| Field | Description | Set By |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| id | UUID identifier | parseAdRequirements |
| parameters | Campaign parameters (product, audience, platform, etc.) | parseAdRequirements |
| research | Research report with insights and recommendations | conductAdResearch |
| ad_copy | Two ad copy variations (A/B) | generateAdCopy |
| images | Two image variations (A/B) | generateAdImages |
| mixed_media | Final composite creative | generateMixedMedia |
| selected_ad_copy_variation | User's chosen copy (A or B) | User selection |
| selected_image_variation | User's chosen image (A or B) | User selection |

## Completion Status

Check these flags to determine campaign progress:

- **hasParameters**: Campaign parameters are set
- **hasResearch**: Research report is complete
- **hasAdCopy**: Ad copy variations generated
- **hasImages**: Image variations generated
- **hasMixedMedia**: Final creative is ready
- **hasSelectedAdCopy**: User selected a copy variation
- **hasSelectedImage**: User selected an image variation
- **isComplete**: All components are present

## Workflow Guidance

### Determining Next Step

Based on completion status, recommend:

| Status | Next Action |
|--------|-------------|
| No parameters | Call parseAdRequirements |
| Parameters only | Call conductAdResearch |
| Has research | Call generateAdCopy |
| Has ad copy | Call generateAdImages |
| Has images | User selects variations, then generateMixedMedia |
| Complete | Campaign ready for deployment |

### Handling Missing Selections

Before generating mixed media:
1. Check if ad copy variation is selected
2. Check if image variation is selected
3. If not selected, prompt user to choose A or B

## Output Format

When reporting campaign status, return:

```json
{
  "campaign_id": "uuid",
  "campaign_name": "name or null",
  "status": "in_progress or complete",
  "completion": {
    "hasParameters": true,
    "hasResearch": true,
    "hasAdCopy": false,
    "hasImages": false,
    "hasMixedMedia": false,
    "hasSelectedAdCopy": false,
    "hasSelectedImage": false
  },
  "next_step": "generateAdCopy",
  "next_step_description": "Generate ad copy variations based on research insights",
  "created_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "updated_at": "ISO timestamp"
}
```

## Important Notes

- Campaign IDs are UUIDs - validate format before querying
- All campaign data is persisted in PostgreSQL
- Each workflow step updates the campaign record
- Missing components block downstream steps
- User selections are required before mixed media generation
