# Shared Memory — cross-agent project knowledge

Most agent tools store memory in their own private location: Claude Code uses
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`, Cursor uses `.cursorrules`, Codex reads
`AGENTS.md`, etc. None of them read each other's stores. This skill defines a
**single on-disk convention** so any agent that knows about it — and any human
running `cat` — can read project memory written by any other agent.

## The convention — two layers

### Layer 1 — `.agents/memory/` inside the repo (SHARED, git-tracked)

```
<repo>/
├── .agents/
│   └── memory/
│       ├── MEMORY.md                  ← index, every agent reads this first
│       ├── glossary-terms.md
│       ├── project-vision.md
│       ├── engineering-cost-discipline.md
│       └── ...
```

- **Lives in git.** Anyone who clones the repo gets the memory.
- **All agents read it.** Bridge files (see § Cross-agent advertisement)
  make sure Cursor / Codex / Claude / Aider / OpenClaw all find this dir.
- **Public.** If the repo is public, the memory is public. Do NOT put
  customer lists, prices paid, personal email, account credentials, or
  anything that should not appear on GitHub here.

### Layer 2 — `~/.shared-memory/<project-slug>/` (PRIVATE, machine-local)

```
~/.shared-memory/
├── kompany/
│   ├── MEMORY.md
│   ├── personal-preferences.md
│   ├── gh-auth-account.md            ← which github user runs which repo
│   ├── customer-list.md
│   └── feedback-incidents.md
├── another-project/
│   └── ...
```

- **Not in git.** Stays on your machine, follows you only via Dropbox /
  iCloud / Time Machine.
- **All agents read it** — same convention, same index format, just a
  different known path.
- **Private.** Buyer lists, paid amounts, personal email, GitHub account
  trivia, vibe-coding preferences, all go here.

`<project-slug>` = the repo directory's basename, lowercased. For
`/Users/clarezoe/Dropbox/My Apps/Kompany` → slug is `kompany`. Skill
auto-derives via `basename "$PWD" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`.

## Memory file format

Every memory file is plain Markdown. Header:

```markdown
---
name: glossary-terms
description: One-line summary used by future agents to decide relevance.
metadata:
  type: reference         # user | feedback | project | reference | engineering
  scope: shared           # shared (Layer 1) or private (Layer 2)
  created: 2026-05-24
  updated: 2026-05-24
---

# Body

Plain Markdown. Link to other memories with [[their-name]].
```

Both `MEMORY.md` indexes follow the same pattern:

```markdown
# Project memory index

Each line points at one memory file. ~150 chars max — agents truncate
after line 200 to bound context cost.

- [Glossary](glossary-terms.md) — one-line hook
- [Vision](project-vision.md) — one-line hook
...
```

`MEMORY.md` has NO frontmatter — it's an index, not a memory.

## Skill operations

### Operation 1 — Locate memory at session start

When the user starts a session OR mentions a project topic that suggests
memory might exist:

```bash
# Project root (or anywhere inside the project tree)
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
SLUG="$(basename "$REPO_ROOT" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"

# Layer 1 (shared, in-repo)
SHARED_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/.agents/memory"

# Layer 2 (private, home)
PRIVATE_DIR="$HOME/.shared-memory/$SLUG"

# Read both indexes (if present)
[ -f "$SHARED_DIR/MEMORY.md" ] && cat "$SHARED_DIR/MEMORY.md"
[ -f "$PRIVATE_DIR/MEMORY.md" ] && cat "$PRIVATE_DIR/MEMORY.md"
```

Do not load every individual memory file — only the indexes. Pull individual
files on demand when their description matches the current question.

### Operation 2 — Write a new memory

```
Question 1: Is this memory shared or private?
  - shared  → goes in <repo>/.agents/memory/, ENTERS GIT
  - private → goes in ~/.shared-memory/<slug>/, STAYS LOCAL

Question 2: What type?
  - user        — facts about the person you're collaborating with
  - feedback    — corrections or validated approaches from the user
  - project     — facts about the project goals / state / decisions
  - reference   — pointers to external systems or accounts
  - engineering — cross-cutting code conventions
```

Sensitive-content gate before writing to `shared`:

```text
Block save if the body contains any of:
  - email address (regex: \b\w[\w.+-]*@\w[\w.-]+\.\w+\b)
  - monetary amount with currency ($X, €X, ¥X, CNY)
  - "customer", "buyer", "subscriber" + name
  - GitHub PAT / SSH private key patterns
  - phone number
Re-prompt user: "This looks sensitive — save as PRIVATE instead?"
```

After writing the file, update the matching `MEMORY.md` with one line:
`- [Title](filename.md) — one-line hook`.

### Operation 3 — Cross-agent advertisement

When `.agents/memory/` is first created in a repo, add bridge mentions
so other agents find it automatically:

| Agent | File | Snippet to ensure exists |
|---|---|---|
| Codex / Aider / generic | `AGENTS.md` (root) | Section "## Shared memory" with line pointing at `.agents/memory/MEMORY.md` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` (root) — only if used | Same section |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` | Single line: `Shared memory lives at .agents/memory/MEMORY.md — read it before answering.` |
| OpenClaw | `KOMPANY.md` or whatever the project uses | Same section |

The skill should grep each bridge file for `.agents/memory/` and add the
section if missing. Idempotent — never duplicate.

### Operation 4 — Migrate from a single-agent store

When invoked with the phrase "migrate memory from Claude Code" or similar:

1. List entries in `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/MEMORY.md`.
2. For each, classify as shared vs private using the sensitive-content gate.
3. Copy to the right layer; update both `MEMORY.md` indexes.
4. Leave the original in place (don't delete) — Claude Code keeps using
   it; other agents now pick up the shared copies via Layer 1/2.

Migration is per-memory, not bulk. Ask the user once per ambiguous file;
batch the clear-cut ones.

## What stays out of shared memory

Even when "shared" is chosen, refuse to save:

- API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, .env contents.
- Personally identifying customer data (names + transaction amounts).
- In-flight credentials of any external service.
- Anything the user wraps in `[sensitive] ... [/sensitive]` blocks in
  their prompt.

If the user insists, route to PRIVATE layer instead and warn that
Dropbox / iCloud sync still propagates those files to other devices.

## Conflict resolution

If `.agents/memory/<name>.md` exists AND `~/.shared-memory/<slug>/<name>.md`
exists:

- They are DIFFERENT memories with the same slug → rename one.
- They are the SAME content drift → shared layer wins; update private
  to match (and re-classify if the content drifted into sensitive
  territory).

Never silently merge.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Writing to ONLY a tool-specific store (e.g. only Claude Code's
  `~/.claude/projects/...`) when the memory is shareable.
- ❌ Putting personal preferences in `.agents/memory/` — they pollute
  git history and travel with every repo clone forever.
- ❌ Letting bridge files diverge — if `AGENTS.md` says memory lives at
  one path and `.cursorrules` says another, agents desync.
- ❌ Generating placeholder index entries with descriptions like "this
  file" or "see body" — descriptions must contain enough keywords for
  future agents to know when to load.

## Implementation hints

- `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` is the safest project-root resolver;
  fall back to `pwd` when not in a git repo.
- The skill's own files should never be written into `.agents/memory/`
  — meta-recursion bad.
- `mkdir -p` both layers on first write; don't fail if either is missing.

## Cross-references

- Claude-Code-specific memory (legacy): `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`
- Sessions handoff convention: `.trellis/handoffs/` (orthogonal — handoffs
  are conversation summaries, not memories)
- ADR template / context docs / glossaries — repo docs that ARE shared
  memory in spirit, just unstructured. The skill respects them; it
  doesn't duplicate.
