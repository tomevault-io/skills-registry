## File Management

### Output Directory

Each session creates an independent directory named by content slug:

```
illustrations/{topic-slug}/
├── source-{slug}.{ext}    # Source files (text, images, etc.)
├── outline.md
├── outline-{style}.md     # Style variant outlines
├── prompts/
│   ├── illustration-concept-a.md
│   ├── illustration-concept-b.md
│   └── ...
├── illustration-concept-a.png
├── illustration-concept-b.png
└── ...
```

**Slug Generation**:
1. Extract main topic from content (2-4 words, kebab-case)
2. Example: "The Future of AI" → `future-of-ai`

### Conflict Resolution

If `illustrations/{topic-slug}/` already exists:
- Append timestamp: `{topic-slug}-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Example: `ai-future` exists → `ai-future-20260118-143052`

### Source Files

Copy all sources with naming `source-{slug}.{ext}`:
- `source-article.md` (main text content)
- `source-photo.jpg` (image from conversation)
- `source-reference.pdf` (additional file)

Multiple sources supported: text, images, files from conversation.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Content & Select Style

1. Read article content
2. If `--style` specified, use that style
3. Otherwise, scan for style signals and auto-select
4. **Language detection**:
   - Detect **source language** from article content
   - Detect **user language** from conversation context
   - Note if source_language ≠ user_language (will ask in Step 4)
5. Extract key information:
   - Main topic and themes
   - Core messages per section
   - Abstract concepts needing visualization

### Step 2: Identify Illustration Positions

**Three Purposes of Illustrations**:
1. **Information Supplement**: Help understand abstract concepts
2. **Concept Visualization**: Transform abstract ideas into concrete visuals
3. **Imagination Guidance**: Create atmosphere, enhance reading experience

**Content Suitable for Illustrations**:
- Abstract concepts needing visualization
- Processes/steps needing diagrams
- Comparisons needing visual representation
- Core arguments needing reinforcement
- Scenarios needing imagination guidance

**Illustration Count**:
- **Normal articles (< 3000 words)**: Generate 3 illustrations
- **Long articles (3000-5000 words)**: Generate 4 illustrations
- **Very long articles (> 5000 words)**: Generate 5 illustrations
- Prioritize core arguments and abstract concepts
- **Principle: Quality over quantity - avoid over-illustrating**

### Step 3: Generate Illustration Plan

**Before creating the plan, record path information**:

1. **Article absolute path**: [full path to article]
2. **Article relative path from project root**: [e.g., content/drafts/article.md]
3. **Illustration output directory**: illustrations/[topic-slug]/
4. **Relative path from article to illustrations**: [calculated path, e.g., ../../illustrations/[topic-slug]/]

This information will be used in Step 7 to ensure correct image paths.

```markdown
# Illustration Plan

**Article**: [article path]
**Article location**: [relative path from project root]
**Illustration directory**: illustrations/[topic-slug]/
**Relative path for markdown**: [../../illustrations/[topic-slug]/ or correct path]
**Style**: [selected style]
**Illustration Count**: N images

---

## Illustration 1

**Insert Position**: [section name] / [paragraph description]
**Purpose**: [why illustration needed here]
**Visual Content**: [what the image should show]
**Filename**: illustration-[slug].png

---

## Illustration 2
...
```

### Step 4: Review & Confirm

**Purpose**: Let user confirm all options in a single step before image generation.

**IMPORTANT**: Present ALL options in a single confirmation step using AskUserQuestion. Do NOT interrupt workflow with multiple separate confirmations.

1. **Generate 3 style variants**:
   - Analyze content to select 3 most suitable styles
   - Generate complete illustration plan for each style variant
   - Save as `outline-{style}.md` (e.g., `outline-notion.md`, `outline-tech.md`, `outline-warm.md`)

2. **Determine which questions to ask**:

   | Question | When to Ask |
   |----------|-------------|
   | Style variant | Always (required) |
   | Language | Only if `source_language ≠ user_language` |

3. **Present options** (use AskUserQuestion with all applicable questions):

   **Question 1 (Style)** - always:
   - Style A (recommended): [style name] - [brief description]
   - Style B: [style name] - [brief description]
   - Style C: [style name] - [brief description]
   - Custom: Provide custom style reference

   **Question 2 (Language)** - only if source ≠ user language:
   - [Source language] (matches article language)
   - [User language] (your preference)

   **Language handling**:
   - If source language = user language: Just inform user (e.g., "Prompts will be in Chinese")
   - If different: Ask which language to use for prompts

4. **Apply selection**:
   - Copy selected `outline-{style}.md` to `outline.md`
   - If custom style provided, generate new plan with that style
   - If different language selected, regenerate outline in that language
   - User may edit `outline.md` directly for fine-tuning
   - If modified, reload plan before proceeding

5. **Proceed only after explicit user confirmation**

### Step 5: Create Prompt Files

Save prompts to `prompts/` directory with style-specific details.

**All prompts are written in the user's confirmed language preference.**

**Prompt Format**:

```markdown
Illustration theme: [concept in 2-3 words]
Style: [style name]

Visual composition:
- Main visual: [description matching style]
- Layout: [element positioning]
- Decorative elements: [style-appropriate decorations]

Color scheme:
- Primary: [style primary color]
- Background: [style background color]
- Accent: [style accent color]

Text content (if any):
- [Any labels or captions in content language]

Style notes: [specific style characteristics]
```

### Step 6: Generate Images

**Image Generation Skill Selection**:
1. Check available image generation skills
2. If multiple skills available, ask user to choose

**Generation Flow**:
1. Call selected image generation skill with prompt file and output path
2. Generate images sequentially
3. After each image, output progress: "Generated X/N"
4. On failure, auto-retry once
5. If retry fails, log reason, continue to next

### Step 7: Update Article

**CRITICAL: Calculate Correct Relative Path**

Before inserting images, you MUST calculate the correct relative path:

1. **Get absolute paths**:
   - Article absolute path (e.g., `/project/content/drafts/article.md`)
   - Illustration directory absolute path (e.g., `/project/illustrations/topic-slug/`)

2. **Calculate relative path**:
   - Count directory levels from article to project root
   - Example: `content/drafts/article.md` → needs `../../` to reach root
   - Then append illustration path: `../../illustrations/topic-slug/image.png`

3. **Verify the path calculation**:
   ```bash
   # Get article directory
   ARTICLE_DIR=$(dirname /path/to/article.md)

   # Calculate relative path from article to illustration
   # Use realpath or Python to calculate if needed
   ```

4. **Common patterns**:
   - Article in `content/drafts/` → use `../../illustrations/`
   - Article in `content/` → use `../illustrations/`
   - Article in root → use `illustrations/`

**Insert images with CORRECT relative path**:

```markdown
![illustration description](../../illustrations/topic-slug/illustration-[slug].png)
```

**Insertion Rules**:
- **CRITICAL**: Verify relative path is correct before inserting
- Insert image after corresponding paragraph
- Leave one blank line before and after image
- Alt text uses concise description in article's language
- After inserting ALL images, verify each path exists relative to article location

### Step 8: Output Summary

**Final Verification**:

Before completing, verify all image paths are correct:

```bash
# Verify each image path exists relative to article location
cd $(dirname /path/to/article.md)
ls ../../illustrations/topic-slug/illustration-1.png
ls ../../illustrations/topic-slug/illustration-2.png
# ... verify all paths
```

If any path verification fails, recalculate and fix the paths in the article.

**Output Summary**:

```
Article Illustration Complete!

Article: [article path]
Article location: [relative from project root]
Illustration directory: illustrations/[topic-slug]/
Relative path used: ../../illustrations/[topic-slug]/
Style: [style name]
Generated: X/N images successful

✅ Image paths verified: All paths exist and are accessible from article location

Illustration Positions:
- illustration-xxx.png → After section "Section Name"
- illustration-yyy.png → After section "Another Section"
...

[If any failures]
Failed:
- illustration-zzz.png: [failure reason]
```

## Illustration Modification

Support for modifying individual illustrations after initial generation.

### Edit Single Illustration

Regenerate a specific illustration with modified prompt:

1. Identify illustration to edit (e.g., `illustration-concept-overview.png`)
2. Update prompt in `prompts/illustration-concept-overview.md` if needed
3. If content changes significantly, update slug in filename
4. Regenerate image
5. Update article if image reference changed

### Add New Illustration

Add a new illustration to the article:

1. Identify insertion position in article
2. Create new prompt with appropriate slug (e.g., `illustration-new-concept.md`)
3. Generate new illustration image
4. Update `outline.md` with new illustration entry
5. Insert image reference in article at the specified position

### Delete Illustration

Remove an illustration from the article:

1. Identify illustration to delete (e.g., `illustration-concept-overview.png`)
2. Remove image file and prompt file
3. Remove image reference from article
4. Update `outline.md` to remove illustration entry

### File Naming Convention

Files use meaningful slugs for better readability:
```
illustration-[slug].png
illustration-[slug].md (in prompts/)
```

Examples:
- `illustration-concept-overview.png`
- `illustration-workflow-diagram.png`
- `illustration-key-benefits.png`

**Slug rules**:
- Derived from illustration purpose/content (kebab-case)
- Must be unique within the article
- When content changes significantly, update slug accordingly

## References

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `references/styles/<style>.md` | Full style specifications with colors, elements, rules |

## Notes

- Illustrations serve the content: supplement information, visualize concepts
- Maintain selected style consistency across all illustrations in one article
- Image generation typically takes 10-30 seconds per image
- Sensitive figures should use cartoon alternatives
- Prompts written in user's confirmed language preference
- Illustration text (labels, captions) should match article language

## Extension Support

Custom styles and configurations via EXTEND.md.

**Check paths** (priority order):
1. `.baoyu-skills/baoyu-article-illustrator/EXTEND.md` (project)
2. `~/.baoyu-skills/baoyu-article-illustrator/EXTEND.md` (user)

If found, load before Step 1. Extension content overrides defaults.
