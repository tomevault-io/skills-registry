# GDD Creation

## GDD Document Structure

### Modular GDD: `docs/design/gdd/`

Modern GDD structure uses modular organization:

| `1_overview.md` | High concept, elevator pitch, target audience |
| `2_paint_friction_system.md` | Core gameplay mechanics |
| `3_movement_system.md` | Player controls and locomotion |
| `4_territory_control.md` | Win conditions and territory gameplay |
| `5_weapon_system.md` | Combat and weapons |
| `8_ui_hud_system.md` | Interface and feedback |
| `13_multiplayer.md` | Network architecture and sync |

### Main Document Template: `docs/design/gdd.md` (Optional)

## Supporting Artifacts

The GDD is supported by separate documents:

| Artifact | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Core Loop Spec | Minute-by-minute gameplay | `docs/design/core_loop.md` |
| Decision Log | Design decisions with rationale | `docs/design/decision_log.md` |
| Open Questions | Unresolved design questions | `docs/design/open_questions.md` |
| Gear Registry | Items, weapons, equipment | `docs/design/gear_registry.md` |
| Map Templates | Level designs | `docs/design/map_templates.md` |
| Economy Model | Currency systems | `docs/design/economy_model.md` |
| Visual Language | Art/UX direction | `docs/design/visual_language.md` |
| Tech Spec | Technical requirements | `docs/design/tech_spec.md` |
| MVD Checklist | Prototype readiness | `docs/design/mvd_checklist.md` |

---

## GDD Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Repository Analysis

Gather context about the project:

```bash
# Read project files for context
Read("README.md")
Read("package.json")
Read("prd.json")
Glob("src/**/*")  # List source files
```

Document:
- Project type and genre
- Current implementation status
- Technology stack
- Team size and structure

### Step 2: Research Phase

Use web-search and GitHub MCP:
- Research similar games
- Find reference implementations
- Document inspirations
- Identify best practices

### Step 3: Design Sessions

Use thermite-design skill for structured sessions:
- Boardroom Retreat for core concepts
- Deep Dive for specific domains
- Decision Review for validation

### Step 4: Draft GDD

Create the main GDD document with all sections.

### Step 5: Iterate

Refine through self-iteration and team feedback.

## UI/UX Feature Documentation (feat-027)

**Lesson from feat-027 (Star Rating Preview):** UI features require specific visual and behavior documentation.

### UI Feature Section Template

When documenting UI features in GDD, use this structure:

```markdown
### 8. UI/UX System

#### 8.1 HUD Elements

**Star Rating Preview**
- **Purpose**: Show player progress toward star ratings in real-time
- **Position**: Center-top of screen (y: 80 from top)
- **Elements**: 3 star icons displayed horizontally

**Behavior Specification**:
1. **Initial State**: All stars shown as outline (gray, 30% alpha)
2. **Fill Progression**: Stars fill sequentially as score increases
3. **Visual Feedback**: Smooth color transition (gray → yellow)
4. **Animation Timing**: 300ms tween duration with Quadratic.Out easing
5. **Completed State**: Filled stars pulse subtly (scale 1.1)

**Threshold Formula** (from DEC-004):
- 2-star: 32,000 + (level × 2,000)
- 3-star: 66,000 + (level × 6,000)

**Technical Notes**:
- Score updates trigger immediate star state recalculation
- Tweens killed before creating new ones (prevent accumulation)
- Event-driven: Listens to `totalScoreUpdate` events
```

### UI Animation Documentation

When UI elements have animations:

| Element | Animation | Duration | Easing | Purpose |
|---------|------------|----------|---------|---------|
| Star fill | Color interpolation | 300ms | Quadratic.Out | Smooth status transition |
| Star pulse | Scale +1.1 | 200ms | Sine.InOut | Highlight effect |
| Queue bounce | Y offset ±5 | 1000ms | Sine.InOut | Idle animation |

### Interactive UI Elements

For buttons and interactive UI:

```markdown
#### Retry Button (feat-028)
- **Position**: Top-right corner, semi-transparent
- **Behavior**: Instant level reset on click
- **States**: Normal, Hover (brighten), Active (scale 0.95)
- **Accessibility**: 48×48px minimum touch target

#### Settings Button (feat-028)
- **Position**: Top-right, below retry button
- **Opens**: Settings overlay with:
  - Master volume slider (0-100%)
  - SFX volume slider (0-100%)
  - Music volume slider (0-100%)
  - Mute toggle checkbox
  - Quality toggle (Low/Medium/High)
- **Persistence**: All settings saved to localStorage
```

### Visual Design Language

When specifying UI appearance:

```markdown
**Color System**:
- Star Empty: #CCCCCC (RGB: 204, 204, 204)
- Star Full: #FFCC00 (RGB: 255, 204, 0)
- Background: Semi-transparent black

**Typography**:
- Font: Rajdhani or similar gaming font
- Sizes: 18px body, 24px headers
- Weights: 500 (regular), 600 (semibold), 700 (bold)

**Spacing System**:
- Star spacing: 8px gap between stars
- Button padding: 12px vertical, 24px horizontal
- Section margins: 16px between UI groups
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Too vague | Developers won't know what to build | Be specific with numbers and examples |
| Over-specifying | Stifles creativity, hard to maintain | Focus on what, not how |
| No versioning | Can't track changes | Always version your GDD |
| Ignoring technical constraints | Unrealistic designs | Consult technical team early |
| Writing for AAA scope on indie budget | Unrealistic expectations | Scope appropriately |
| Not updating | Document becomes obsolete | Maintain regularly |
