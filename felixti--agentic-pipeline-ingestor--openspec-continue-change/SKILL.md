Continue working on a change by creating the next artifact.

**When to Use**
- User says "continue", "next", "create the next artifact"
- User wants to create proposal, specs, design, or tasks
- User is working on an existing change and wants to progress

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   List available changes:
   ```bash
   python .agents/openspec_kit.py list
   ```
   
   Ask the user to select which change to work on. Show:
   - Change name
   - Schema (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - Status (e.g., "1/4 artifacts")
   - Recommendation: Mark the most recently modified change as "(Recommended)"

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check current status**
   ```bash
   python .agents/openspec_kit.py status "<name>"
   ```
   
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow schema being used
   - `artifacts`: Array of artifacts with their status ("done", "ready", "blocked")
   - `isComplete`: Boolean indicating if all artifacts are complete

3. **Act based on status**:

   ---

   **If all artifacts are complete (`isComplete: true`)**:
   - Congratulate the user
   - Show final status
   - Suggest: "All artifacts created! You can now implement this change using openspec-apply-change or archive it."
   - STOP

   ---

   **If artifacts are ready to create** (status shows artifacts with `status: "ready"`):
   - Pick the FIRST artifact with `status: "ready"` from the status output
   - Get its instructions:
     ```bash
     python .agents/openspec_kit.py instructions <artifact-id> "<name>"
     ```
   - Parse the JSON. Key fields:
     - `context`: Project background from dependencies (read these for context)
     - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
     - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance
     - `outputPath`: Where to write the artifact
     - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
   - **Create the artifact file**:
     - Read any completed dependency files for context
     - Use `template` as the structure - fill in its sections
     - Write to the output path specified
   - Show what was created and what's now unlocked
   - STOP after creating ONE artifact

   ---

   **If no artifacts are ready (all blocked)**:
   - This shouldn't happen with a valid schema
   - Show status and suggest checking for issues

4. **After creating an artifact, show progress**
   ```bash
   python .agents/openspec_kit.py status "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After each invocation, show:
- Which artifact was created
- Schema workflow being used
- Current progress (N/M complete)
- What artifacts are now unlocked
- Prompt: "Want to continue? Just ask me to continue or tell me what to do next."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

The artifact types and their purpose depend on the schema:

**spec-driven schema** (proposal → specs → design → tasks):
- **proposal.md**: Ask user about the change if not clear. Fill in Why, What Changes, Capabilities, Impact.
  - The Capabilities section is critical - each capability listed will need a spec file.
- **specs/<capability>/spec.md**: Create one spec per capability listed in the proposal's Capabilities section (use the capability name, not the change name).
- **design.md**: Document technical decisions, architecture, and implementation approach.
- **tasks.md**: Break down implementation into checkboxed tasks.

For other schemas, follow the `instruction` field from the output.

**Guardrails**
- Create ONE artifact per invocation
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- Never skip artifacts or create out of order
- If context is unclear, ask the user before creating
- Verify the artifact file exists after writing before marking progress
- Use the schema's artifact sequence, don't assume specific artifact names
