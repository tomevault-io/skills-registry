# Audit Skill

Validates artifacts against quality gates for hallucination, overengineering, and underengineering detection.

---

## Purpose

The Audit skill is a quality gate that catches common AI implementation pitfalls:

## Agent Compatibility

- AskUserQuestion: use the tool in Claude Code; in Codex CLI, ask the user directly and record the answer.
- OUTPUT_DIR: `.claude/output` for Claude Code, `.codex/output` for Codex CLI.

## Audit Types

### Type 1: Research Audit
Validates research output before planning.

### Type 2: Plan Audit
Validates plan output before implementation.

### Type 3: Implementation Audit
Validates code changes before completion.

## Check 1: Hallucination Detection

### Definition
Hallucination occurs when AI:
- Invents requirements not in PRD
- Assumes behavior without evidence
- Fabricates technical details
- Misinterprets or distorts requirements

### Detection Criteria

| Signal | Description | Severity |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Phantom Requirements** | Requirements not traceable to PRD | Critical |
| **Assumed Behavior** | Behavior defined without specification | High |
| **Invented Edge Cases** | Edge cases not mentioned in PRD | Medium |
| **Fabricated Context** | Technical context without evidence | High |
| **Misquoted Requirements** | Altered wording from original | Medium |
| **Research Carryover** | Using default/research values instead of custom implementation | Critical |

### Hallucination Checklist

```
For each claim/requirement/decision, verify:

□ Is this explicitly stated in the PRD?
  - YES: ✓ Traceable
  - NO: Check if reasonable inference

□ If inferred, is the inference justified?
  - Is it based on project patterns?
  - Is it based on technical necessity?
  - Is it marked as an assumption?

□ Are all quotes accurate?
  - Compare against original PRD
  - No paraphrasing without marking

□ Are technical claims verifiable?
  - Can be confirmed from codebase?
  - Based on documentation?
  - Standard practice?

□ For custom configurations:
  - Is implementation using its OWN defined constants?
  - Or accidentally using defaults from research?
```

### Hallucination Scoring

```
Hallucination Score = (Phantom Items / Total Items) × 100

Thresholds:
- 0-10%: Excellent - Minimal hallucination
- 11-20%: Acceptable - Minor assumptions
- 21-40%: Warning - Needs clarification
- 41%+: Fail - Too much invention
```

### Hallucination Response Protocol

**CRITICAL: When assumptions are detected, MUST confirm with user before marking as hallucination.**

When audit detects:
- Assumed Behavior (not in PRD)
- Invented Edge Cases
- Unconfirmed Decisions

**MUST ask the user (AskUserQuestion tool in Claude Code, or direct question in Codex CLI) BEFORE marking as "hallucination":**

```
AskUserQuestion(
  questions: [
    {
      question: "The plan assumes [X behavior]. Is this correct?",
      header: "Confirm assumption",
      options: [
        { label: "Yes, correct", description: "Proceed with this behavior" },
        { label: "No, should be Y", description: "Change to different behavior" },
        { label: "Need to discuss", description: "Requires more context" }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
)
```

**Audit Verdict Rules:**
- If user confirms assumption → NOT a hallucination, mark as "User Confirmed"
- If user rejects assumption → Flag as hallucination, require fix
- If user needs discussion → HALT audit, gather more context

**Rules:**
1. NEVER auto-fail assumptions - ASK user first
2. NEVER skip confirmation for edge case behaviors
3. Document all confirmations: "(User confirmed via AskUserQuestion or direct question)"

---

## Check 2: Overengineering Detection

### Definition
Overengineering occurs when AI:
- Adds unnecessary complexity
- Builds for hypothetical futures
- Creates premature abstractions
- Implements beyond requirements

### Detection Criteria

| Signal | Description | Severity |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Scope Creep** | Features beyond requirements | High |
| **Premature Abstraction** | Generalization without need | Medium |
| **Future-Proofing** | Building for speculative needs | Medium |
| **Unnecessary Layers** | Extra architecture without benefit | High |
| **Gold Plating** | Nice-to-haves treated as must-haves | Medium |
| **Over-Configuration** | Excessive configurability | Low |

### Overengineering Checklist

```
For each proposed element, verify:

□ Is this required by PRD?
  - YES: ✓ Required
  - NO: Is it technically necessary?

□ If not in PRD, is it technically necessary?
  - Error handling for the feature? ✓
  - Generic utility for future? ✗
  - Abstraction for single use? ✗

□ Complexity check:
  - Could this be simpler?
  - Is abstraction premature?
  - Are we building for hypotheticals?

□ Pattern check:
  - Does this follow existing patterns?
  - Are we inventing new patterns?
  - Is deviation justified?
```

### Overengineering Signals in Code

```dart
// OVERENGINEERED - Generic for single use
abstract class BaseFeatureController<T extends BaseState> {
  // Only one implementation exists
}

// CORRECT - Simple and direct
class FeatureController extends StateNotifier<FeatureState> {
  // Specific implementation
}
```

```dart
// OVERENGINEERED - Configuration not requested
class Feature {
  final bool enableAdvancedMode;
  final int maxRetries;
  final Duration timeout;
  final String customEndpoint;
  // None of these in requirements
}

// CORRECT - Only what's needed
class Feature {
  final String name;
  final bool isActive;
  // Matches requirements
}
```

### Overengineering Scoring

```
Overengineering Score = (Unnecessary Items / Total Items) × 100

Thresholds:
- 0-10%: Excellent - Minimal extras
- 11-25%: Acceptable - Some reasonable additions
- 26-40%: Warning - Scope creep detected
- 41%+: Fail - Significant overengineering
```

---

## Check 3: Underengineering Detection

### Definition
Underengineering occurs when AI:
- Misses requirements
- Ignores edge cases
- Skips error handling
- Forgets security/validation
- Incomplete implementation

### Detection Criteria

| Signal | Description | Severity |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Missing Requirements** | PRD items not addressed | Critical |
| **No Error Handling** | Happy path only | High |
| **Missing Validation** | Input not validated | High |
| **Ignored Edge Cases** | Obvious cases not handled | Medium |
| **No Loading States** | Missing UI feedback | Medium |
| **Missing Tests** | No test strategy | Medium |
| **Security Gaps** | Auth/permission not considered | High |

### Underengineering Checklist

```
For each requirement, verify:

□ Is this requirement fully addressed?
  - All acceptance criteria covered?
  - Edge cases handled?
  - Error states defined?

□ Error handling:
  - Network failures?
  - Invalid data?
  - Empty states?
  - Timeout handling?

□ Validation:
  - User input validated?
  - Data type validation?
  - Business rule validation?

□ UI completeness:
  - Loading states?
  - Error states?
  - Empty states?
  - Success feedback?

□ Security considerations:
  - Authentication checked?
  - Authorization handled?
  - Data sanitization?
```

### Underengineering Scoring

```
Underengineering Score = (Missing Items / Required Items) × 100

Thresholds:
- 0-10%: Excellent - Comprehensive
- 11-20%: Acceptable - Minor gaps
- 21-35%: Warning - Needs additions
- 36%+: Fail - Too incomplete
```

---

## Balance Score

The Balance Score measures the sweet spot between over and under engineering:

```
Balance Score = 100 - |Overengineering - Underengineering|/2 - max(Over, Under)/2

Interpretation:
- High Balance (70+): Good equilibrium
- Medium Balance (50-69): Leaning one direction
- Low Balance (<50): Significantly imbalanced

Ideal State:
- Low overengineering (≤15%)
- Low underengineering (≤15%)
- High balance (≥70%)
```

---

## Audit Execution

### Input Analysis

```
1. Load artifact to audit (research.md, plan.md, or code diff)
2. Load original PRD/requirements
3. Load project context (AGENTS.md, patterns)
```

### Systematic Check

```
For each item in artifact:
  1. Trace to PRD → Hallucination Check
  2. Assess necessity → Overengineering Check
  3. Check completeness → Underengineering Check
  4. Score and categorize
```

### Finding Categories

```
Findings:
├── CRITICAL: Must fix before proceeding
├── HIGH: Should fix, significant impact
├── MEDIUM: Recommended fix
├── LOW: Nice to fix
└── INFO: Observation only
```
