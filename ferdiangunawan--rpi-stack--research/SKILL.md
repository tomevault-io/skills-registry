# Research Skill

Conducts thorough research on requirements and codebase before implementation.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Need to understand a Jira ticket before planning
- Exploring feasibility of a feature
- Gathering context about existing code patterns
- Assessing complexity of a task

## Agent Compatibility

- AskUserQuestion: use the tool in Claude Code; in Codex CLI, ask the user directly and record the answer.
- Subagents/Task tool: use if available; otherwise run the searches yourself (parallel if possible).
- OUTPUT_DIR: `.claude/output` for Claude Code, `.codex/output` for Codex CLI.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Input Gathering

**From Jira:**
```
Use mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue to extract:
- Summary (title)
- Description (requirements)
- Acceptance Criteria
- Linked Confluence pages
```

**From Codebase (Using Parallel Exploration):**
```
Use subagents (Task tool) if available; otherwise run the following searches yourself (parallel if possible):

Agent 1 (quick thoroughness):
  "Search for similar features/patterns matching {feature keywords}"

Agent 2 (medium thoroughness):
  "Find all files that might be affected by {feature}, including
   dependencies and related components"

Agent 3 (thorough - optional for complex features):
  "Understand the existing architecture for {related domain},
   including data flow and state management patterns"

After agents complete:
1. Synthesize findings from all agents
2. Read AGENTS.md for project conventions
3. Identify existing components to reuse
```

### Phase 2: Requirement Analysis

For each requirement, identify:
- Type: functional/non-functional/constraint
- Priority: must-have/should-have/nice-to-have
- Complexity: low/medium/high
- Affected layers: presentation/application/domain/data
- Dependencies
- Risks

### Phase 3: Codebase Mapping

Map requirements to existing code:
- Similar features to reference
- Reusable components (widgets, services)
- API endpoints (existing vs new needed)
- State management patterns

### Phase 4: Gap Analysis

Identify:
- New code needed (screens, controllers, models, services)
- API gaps
- Missing information / unclear requirements
- Technical unknowns

### Phase 4.5: MANDATORY Clarification Gate

**CRITICAL: This phase is BLOCKING. Do not proceed to Phase 5 until all questions are answered.**

When ANY of these are identified in Phase 4:
- Missing information
- Unclear requirements
- Edge cases without explicit behavior
- Technical unknowns
- Multiple valid interpretations

---

#### R-Checkpoints (Research Questions)

**R1: Requirement Ambiguity**
When a requirement has multiple interpretations:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Requirement '{X}' could mean '{A}' or '{B}'. Which interpretation is correct?",
      header: "Requirement",
      options: [
        { label: "Interpretation A", description: "{details of A}" },
        { label: "Interpretation B", description: "{details of B}" },
        { label: "Neither", description: "Let me explain..." }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
)
```

**R2: Missing Information**
When the PRD/Jira doesn't specify something needed:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  questions: [
    {
      question: "The PRD doesn't specify '{X}'. What should the behavior be?",
      header: "Missing Spec",
      options: [
        { label: "Option A", description: "{behavior A}" },
        { label: "Option B", description: "{behavior B}" },
        { label: "Skip for now", description: "Mark as open question for stakeholder" }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
)
```

**R3: Technical Unknowns**
When technical feasibility or approach is uncertain:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Implementing '{X}' requires choosing between '{A}' and '{B}'. Which approach?",
      header: "Technical",
      options: [
        { label: "Approach A", description: "Pros: X, Cons: Y" },
        { label: "Approach B", description: "Pros: Y, Cons: Z" },
        { label: "Need more research", description: "Defer decision, gather more info" }
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
)
```

---

**Rules:**
1. NEVER assume behavior - ASK
2. NEVER write "Recommendation: X" without asking first
3. NEVER mark "Open Questions" without immediately asking them
4. Document user's answer in research output
5. Each R-checkpoint MUST be resolved before Phase 5

**Research Phase Complete Criteria:**
```
□ All R1 checkpoints resolved (no ambiguous requirements)
□ All R2 checkpoints resolved (no missing info without explicit skip)
□ All R3 checkpoints resolved (technical approach decided)
```

**Anti-Pattern:**
```markdown
## Open Questions
1. What should display when X?
   - Recommendation: Show "–" ← WRONG! Should have asked user!
```

**Correct Pattern:**
```markdown
## Clarified with User
1. What should display when X? [R2]
   - User confirmed: Show "–" (via AskUserQuestion)
```

### Phase 5: Confidence Scoring

Calculate confidence across dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Requirement Clarity | 25% | How clear are requirements? |
| Codebase Understanding | 25% | Do I understand patterns? |
| Technical Feasibility | 20% | Can this be implemented? |
| Scope Definition | 15% | Are boundaries clear? |
| Risk Identification | 15% | Are risks understood? |

**Overall Confidence = Weighted Sum**

Thresholds:
- ≥80%: High confidence, proceed
- 60-79%: Medium, clarify unknowns
- <60%: Low, request more info

### Output

Create `OUTPUT_DIR/research-{feature}.md` with:

```markdown
# Research: {Feature Name}

## Metadata
- Date: {date}
- Source: {Jira/Confluence/Prompt}
- Confidence Score: {X}%

## Requirements Summary
{Parsed requirements with IDs}

## Codebase Analysis
{Related code, patterns to follow, reusable components}

## Technical Analysis
{Architecture impact, new code required, API needs}

## Risk Assessment
{Risks with likelihood/impact/mitigation}

## Confidence Assessment
{Scores per dimension, blockers, questions}

## Recommendation
{PROCEED / CLARIFY / HALT}
```

## Progress Tracking (MANDATORY when called from RPI)

**If this skill is invoked as part of an RPI workflow, you MUST update progress:**

### On Research Start
```bash
~/.claude/skills/scripts/rpi-progress.sh --phase research --status in_progress --last "Starting research" --next "Complete research analysis"
```

### On Research Complete (before audit)
```bash
~/.claude/skills/scripts/rpi-progress.sh --phase research --status complete --last "Research complete" --next "Research audit"
```

### Progress Values
- Research started: 5%
- Research complete: 10%
- Research audit pass: 15%

## Example


```
User: Research KB-1234 before we plan
Agent: [Fetches Jira, searches codebase, produces research doc]
```
