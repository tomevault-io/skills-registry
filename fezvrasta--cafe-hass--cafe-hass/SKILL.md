description: Create a git commit. Always use this skill when the user asks to commit changes. Runs linting, type checking, and formatting checks before committing to ensure all quality gates pass. Use when this capability is needed.

The user wants to commit changes. Before creating any git commit, you MUST run all quality checks and fix any issues found. Follow these steps in order:

## Step 1: Run quality checks

Run all checks in parallel:

```bash
yarn lint:biome --fix
yarn typecheck
yarn format:check --fix
yarn test
```

## Step 2: Fix all issues

If any check fails:
- **Lint errors**: Run `yarn lint:biome --fix` to auto-fix, then manually fix remaining issues
- **Type errors**: Fix TypeScript errors in the affected files
- **Formatting**: Run `yarn format` (i.e. `yarn format:check --fix`) to auto-format all files

Re-run the failing checks after fixing until they all pass. Do NOT proceed to commit until every check passes with zero errors.

## Step 3: Create the commit

Only after all checks pass, follow the standard commit process:
1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to review changes
2. Stage the relevant files with `git add <specific files>`
3. Write a clear commit message following the existing style
4. Create the commit using a heredoc for the message:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<message here>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

5. Run `git status` to confirm the commit succeeded.

**IMPORTANT**: Never use `--no-verify` or skip hooks. Never commit if any lint, typecheck, or format check is failing.
