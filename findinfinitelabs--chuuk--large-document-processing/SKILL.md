description: Process large documents (200+ pages) with structure preservation, intelligent parsing, and memory-efficient handling. Also covers intelligent text chunking for AI training and RAG systems. Use when working with complex formatted documents, multi-level hierarchies, or when splitting large content for AI pipelines. Use when this capability is needed.

# Large Document Processing & Intelligent Text Chunking

## Overview

Two tightly related concerns combined here:
1. **Large document parsing** — DOCX/PDF/EPUB ingestion with structure preservation
2. **Intelligent text chunking** — splitting parsed text into semantically coherent pieces for AI training or RAG

## Source Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/utils/nwt_epub_parser.py` | EPUB parser for NWT Bible (English + Chuukese) |
| `scripts/extract_jwpub.py` | Extract JW publication `.jwpub` archives |
| `scripts/setup_large_document_processing.py` | One-time document pipeline setup |
| `output/processed_document/` | Output directory for processed content |

## Document Processing

### Supported Formats

- **DOCX** via `python-docx`
- **PDF** via `PyMuPDF` (import as `fitz`) — note: `fitz==0.0.1.dev2` is NOT in requirements; use `PyMuPDF` only
- **EPUB** via `ebooklib` + `NWTEpubParser`
- **Plain text / CSV** — direct read

### EPUB Pattern (NWT Bible)

```python
from src.utils.nwt_epub_parser import NWTEpubParser

parser = NWTEpubParser('data/bible/nwt_E.epub')
verse_text = parser.get_verse('John', 3, 16)
chapter_verses = parser.get_chapter('Genesis', 1)
```

### PDF/DOCX Pattern

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF — installed as PyMuPDF, exposed as fitz

doc = fitz.open('large_document.pdf')
for page_num, page in enumerate(doc):
    text = page.get_text()
    # process text...
```

## Intelligent Text Chunking

### Strategy Selection

| Strategy | Use case |
|---|---|
| Semantic | AI training data — respect topic/paragraph boundaries |
| Structural | Documents with clear headings/sections |
| Fixed-size | RAG systems needing predictable chunk sizes |
| Sliding window | QA tasks needing context overlap |

### Implementation Pattern

```python
# Sentence-boundary-aware chunking
def chunk_text(text: str, max_chars: int = 1024, overlap: int = 100) -> list[str]:
    sentences = re.split(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+', text)
    chunks, current = [], ''
    for sent in sentences:
        if len(current) + len(sent) > max_chars and current:
            chunks.append(current.strip())
            current = current[-overlap:] + ' ' + sent  # overlap
        else:
            current += ' ' + sent
    if current.strip():
        chunks.append(current.strip())
    return chunks
```

### Chuukese-aware chunking

```python
# Chuukese uses the same sentence terminators as English
SENTENCE_ENDINGS = re.compile(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+')

def detect_language(text: str) -> str:
    has_accents = bool(re.search(r'[áéíóú]', text))
    return 'chuukese' if has_accents else 'english'
```

## Memory Efficiency

- Process large PDFs page-by-page, not loading the full DOM into memory
- Stream EPUB chapters — do not load the entire book at once
- Write chunk output incrementally to JSONL files rather than accumulating in RAM

## Output Formats

- **JSONL**: one JSON object per line — best for large training datasets
- **JSON array**: for smaller batches consumed by the frontend
- **Plain text**: cleaned extracted text for inspection

## Dependencies

- `PyMuPDF==1.23.8` — PDF processing (do NOT add `fitz==0.0.1.dev2`)
- `python-docx>=1.2.0`
- `ebooklib>=0.18`
- `beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0`
