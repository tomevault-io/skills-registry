# Dude Review Specs - Interactive Spec Review

Walk through all specifications and architecture decisions for the current project with the user.

## Workflow

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps **in order**:

### Step 1: Fetch Specs

Call these in parallel:

```
dude:list_records { "kind": "spec", "status": "open" }
dude:list_records { "kind": "arch", "status": "open" }
dude:list_records { "kind": "spec", "status": "archived" }
```

### Step 2: Present Summary

Show the user a summary of what exists:
- Total active specs
- Total active architecture decisions
- Total archived specs
- Group active records by prefix: **AUTH**, **API**, **ARCH**, **DATA**, **UI**, **Other**
- List each active record with its ID, kind, and title

### Step 3: Walk Through Active Specs

For each active spec, present it (including body if present) and ask the user:

1. **Still accurate?** — If not, ask what changed and update it
2. **Outdated?** — If yes, archive it
3. **Needs refinement?** — If yes, ask for updates
4. **Keep as-is?** — Move on

Apply changes immediately using:

```
dude:upsert_record { "id": <record_id>, "kind": "spec", "title": "<updated_title>", "body": "<updated_body>", "status": "<new_status>" }
```

### Step 4: Walk Through Architecture Decisions

Repeat the same review for `arch` records. Architecture decisions tend to be longer-lived, so focus on:
- Is the decision still valid given current codebase state?
- Has the implementation drifted from the decision?

### Step 5: New Specs

Ask the user if there are any new specifications or architecture decisions to capture based on the current state of the project. If yes, create them:

```
dude:upsert_record { "kind": "spec", "title": "API: <description>", "body": "<details>" }
dude:upsert_record { "kind": "arch", "title": "ARCH: <description>", "body": "<details>" }
```

### Step 6: Summary

Present a final summary of all changes made during the session:
- Specs updated
- Specs archived
- Architecture decisions updated
- New records created

## Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dude:list_records` | Fetch specs/arch records by kind and status |
| `dude:upsert_record` | Update or create records |
| `dude:search` | Find related specs if needed |
