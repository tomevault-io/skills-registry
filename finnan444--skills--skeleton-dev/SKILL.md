# Skeleton Dev

Reference Skeleton UI v4 LLM-optimized docs before writing or reviewing Skeleton components.

## Docs Sources

First fetch `https://www.skeleton.dev/llms.txt` — this is the comprehensive index of all available LLM docs.

Then detect the framework from the project (package.json, file extensions, imports) and fetch the matching full docs:

| Framework | URL |
|-----------|-----|
| Svelte | `https://www.skeleton.dev/llms-svelte.txt` |
| React | `https://www.skeleton.dev/llms-react.txt` |

Use WebFetch to retrieve the correct reference **before starting any task**.

## Usage

1. Fetch `llms.txt` index to check for any new/updated doc URLs
2. Confirm Skeleton version in `package.json`/lockfiles; if not v4, pause and alert the user before proceeding.
3. Detect framework from the project context. If unclear, ask the user; if still ambiguous, fetch both Svelte/React docs but only read the relevant sections.
4. Fetch the matching framework-specific docs (reuse a cached copy during the session unless `llms.txt` changed).
5. Read the relevant sections for the components needed
6. Write or review code following the documented patterns
