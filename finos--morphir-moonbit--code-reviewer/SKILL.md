# Code Reviewer Skill

## Purpose

This skill provides comprehensive code review capabilities for the Morphir Moonbit monorepo. It helps ensure code quality, consistency, and adherence to project standards before changes are merged.

## When to Use

- Reviewing pull requests
- Before merging code changes
- During code quality checks
- When validating adherence to project conventions

## Review Areas

### 1. Moonbit Code Quality

- **Formatting**: Ensure code follows Moonbit formatting standards (use `moon fmt`)
- **Naming Conventions**: Check that functions, types, and variables follow consistent naming
- **Code Structure**: Verify proper use of modules and package organization
- **Type Safety**: Ensure proper type annotations and type-safe code
- **Comments**: Check for appropriate documentation and comments

### 2. Package Structure

- **Dependencies**: Verify correct dependency declarations in `moon.mod.json`
- **Package Config**: Ensure `moon.pkg.json` is properly configured
- **Module Organization**: Check that code is in the correct package
- **Imports**: Verify proper import statements in `moon.pkg.json`

### 3. Testing

- **Test Coverage**: Ensure new code has corresponding tests
- **Test Files**: Verify test files follow naming convention (`*_test.mbt`)
- **Test Quality**: Check that tests are meaningful and cover edge cases
- **Test Execution**: Verify tests pass with `mise run test`

### 4. Build Configuration

- **Build Targets**: Ensure code works for both WASI and browser (wasm-gc) targets
- **Build Success**: Verify builds complete successfully
- **No Build Warnings**: Check for and address any build warnings

### 5. Documentation

- **README Updates**: Check if README needs updates for new features
- **API Documentation**: Ensure public APIs are documented
- **Code Comments**: Verify complex logic has explanatory comments
- **Examples**: Check if new features include usage examples

### 6. Security

- **Dependencies**: Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Input Validation**: Ensure proper input validation
- **Error Handling**: Verify appropriate error handling
- **Secrets**: Ensure no secrets or sensitive data in code

### 7. Mise Tasks

- **Task Updates**: Check if new functionality requires new mise tasks
- **Task Documentation**: Ensure tasks are documented in `docs/MISE_TASKS.md`
- **Cross-Platform**: Verify both bash and PowerShell versions exist

### 8. CI/CD

- **Workflow Updates**: Check if workflows need updates for new features
- **No Inline Scripts**: Ensure workflows only use mise tasks
- **Parallel Execution**: Verify CI jobs run efficiently in parallel

## Review Process

### Step 1: Understand the Changes

```bash
# View the changes
git diff main...HEAD

# Check which files changed
git diff --name-only main...HEAD
```

### Step 2: Run Local Checks

```bash
# Format code
mise run format

# Run linting
mise run lint

# Run tests
mise run test

# Validate configuration
mise run validate

# Run all checks
mise run check
```

### Step 3: Review Code Quality

- Read through the code changes
- Check for logic errors or potential bugs
- Verify adherence to Moonbit best practices
- Look for opportunities to improve code quality

### Step 4: Check Package Structure

```bash
# Verify package configurations exist
ls -la pkgs/*/moon.mod.json
ls -la pkgs/*/moon.pkg.json

# Validate package structure
mise run validate:packages
```

### Step 5: Verify Tests

```bash
# Run tests for specific package
cd pkgs/<package-name>
moon test

# Run all tests
cd ../..
mise run test
```

### Step 6: Build for All Targets

```bash
# Build for WASI
mise run build:wasi

# Build for browser
mise run build:browser

# Or build all
mise run build
```

### Step 7: Check Documentation

- Review if documentation needs updates
- Verify public APIs are documented
- Check if CHANGELOG should be updated
- Ensure README reflects new features

## Common Issues to Look For

### Moonbit-Specific

- Missing type annotations
- Inconsistent formatting (not using `moon fmt`)
- Improper module imports
- Missing test files for new functionality
- Hard-coded values that should be configurable

### Project-Specific

- Missing both bash and PowerShell versions of mise tasks
- Inline scripts in GitHub workflows (should use mise tasks)
- Breaking changes to existing APIs
- Missing dependencies in `moon.mod.json`
- Incorrect import statements in `moon.pkg.json`

### General Best Practices

- Code duplication
- Overly complex functions (consider breaking down)
- Poor error messages
- Missing edge case handling
- Performance issues

## Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing code:

- [ ] Code is properly formatted (`mise run format`)
- [ ] All linting passes (`mise run lint`)
- [ ] Tests exist for new functionality
- [ ] All tests pass (`mise run test`)
- [ ] Builds succeed for both targets (`mise run build`)
- [ ] Package structure is valid (`mise run validate:packages`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] No secrets or sensitive data in code
- [ ] Mise tasks updated if needed (bash + PowerShell)
- [ ] CI workflows use mise tasks only (no inline scripts)
- [ ] Breaking changes are documented
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Dependencies are properly declared

## Providing Feedback

When providing review feedback:

1. **Be Specific**: Point to exact lines or files
2. **Be Constructive**: Suggest improvements, don't just criticize
3. **Prioritize**: Distinguish between must-fix and nice-to-have
4. **Explain Why**: Help developers understand the reasoning
5. **Acknowledge Good Work**: Point out well-written code too

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Blocks merge - security issues, broken functionality
- **Major**: Should fix before merge - code quality, missing tests
- **Minor**: Nice to have - style improvements, documentation
- **Suggestion**: Optional - potential improvements

## Example Review Comments

### Good Examples

```
Critical: Missing input validation on line 45. This could lead to a runtime 
error if the user provides an empty string. Please add validation.

Major: The function `processData` at line 120 is missing test coverage. 
Please add tests covering both success and error cases.

Minor: Consider extracting lines 80-95 into a separate function for better 
readability and reusability.

Suggestion: Nice use of pattern matching here! You might also consider 
using the Option type instead of nullable for clearer intent.
```

### What to Avoid

```
❌ "This code is bad."
✅ "This function could be simplified by using pattern matching."

❌ "You forgot tests."
✅ "Please add tests for this new function, particularly for the edge case 
   when the input list is empty."

❌ "Wrong."
✅ "The dependency declaration should use version 0.1.0 to match the other 
   packages in the monorepo."
```

## Tools and Commands

### View Changes

```bash
git diff main...HEAD                    # View all changes
git diff --name-only main...HEAD        # List changed files
git diff main...HEAD -- path/to/file    # View changes in specific file
```

### Run Checks Locally

```bash
mise run check          # Run all checks
mise run lint           # Linting only
mise run test           # Tests only
mise run build          # Build only
mise run validate       # Validation only
```

### Package-Specific Checks

```bash
cd pkgs/morphir-core
moon fmt --check        # Check formatting
moon test               # Run tests
moon build --target wasm        # Build for WASI
moon build --target wasm-gc     # Build for browser
```
