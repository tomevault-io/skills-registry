# Orchestrator - Automated Multi-Agent Coordinator

## When to use
- Complex feature requires multiple specialized agents working in parallel
- User wants automated execution without manually spawning agents
- Full-stack implementation spanning backend, frontend, mobile, and QA
- User says "run automatically", "run in parallel", or similar automation requests

## When NOT to use
- Simple single-domain task -> use the specific agent directly
- User wants manual control via Agent Manager UI -> use workflow-guide
- Quick bug fixes or minor changes

## Important
This skill orchestrates CLI subagents via `gemini -p "..." --yolo`. It uses Serena Memory as a shared state bus. Each subagent runs as an independent process.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| MAX_PARALLEL | 3 | Max concurrent subagents |
| MAX_RETRIES | 2 | Retry attempts per failed task |
| POLL_INTERVAL | 30s | Status check interval |
| MAX_TURNS (impl) | 20 | Turn limit for backend/frontend/mobile |
| MAX_TURNS (review) | 15 | Turn limit for qa/debug |
| MAX_TURNS (plan) | 10 | Turn limit for pm |

## Workflow Phases

**PHASE 1 - Plan**: Analyze request -> decompose tasks -> generate session ID
**PHASE 2 - Setup**: `write_memory("orchestrator-session.md")` + `write_memory("task-board.md")`
**PHASE 3 - Execute**: Spawn agents by priority tier (never exceed MAX_PARALLEL)
**PHASE 4 - Monitor**: Poll every POLL_INTERVAL; handle completed/failed/crashed agents
**PHASE 4.5 - Verify**: Run `../_shared/verify.sh {agent-type} {workspace}` per completed agent
**PHASE 5 - Collect**: Read all `result-{agent}.md`, compile summary, cleanup progress files

See `resources/subagent-prompt-template.md` for prompt construction.
See `resources/memory-schema.md` for memory file formats.

## Memory File Ownership

| File | Owner | Others |
|------|-------|--------|
| `orchestrator-session.md` | orchestrator | read-only |
| `task-board.md` | orchestrator | read-only |
| `progress-{agent}.md` | that agent | orchestrator reads |
| `result-{agent}.md` | that agent | orchestrator reads |

## Verification Gate (PHASE 4.5)
After each agent completes, run automated verification before accepting the result:
```bash
bash .agent/skills/_shared/verify.sh {agent-type} {workspace}
```
- **PASS (exit 0)**: Accept result, advance to next task
- **FAIL (exit 1)**: Treat as failure → enter Retry Logic with verify output as error context
- This is mandatory. Never skip verification even if the agent reports success.

## Retry Logic
- 1st retry: Wait 30s, re-spawn with error context (include verify.sh output)
- 2nd retry: Wait 60s, add "Try a different approach"
- Final failure: Report to user, ask whether to continue or abort
