description: Use when deploying or upgrading Move packages to devnet/testnet/mainnet, managing UpgradeCaps, or planning deployment strategy. Triggers on "deploy", "publish", "upgrade package", "sui client publish", "mainnet release", "staged rollout", or any deployment/release task. Also use when the user asks about package versioning or upgrade compatibility.

# SUI Deployer

**Staged deployment orchestration for SUI Move packages.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build and publish to current network
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000

# Dry-run first (recommended)
sui client publish --dry-run --gas-budget 100000000

# Publish and preserve all dependencies in bytecode dump
sui client publish --dump-bytecode-as-base64 --no-tree-shaking
```

## SUI v1.69.1 Deployment Updates (Protocol 119)

**RPC Migration (CRITICAL):**
- **JSON-RPC is deprecated** — removal April 2026. Quorum Driver fully disabled.
- **gRPC is the primary API** — transaction submission exclusively via Transaction Driver.
- `sui client` CLI already uses gRPC internally — no changes needed for CLI workflows.

**gRPC Endpoints:**
| Network | Endpoint |
|---------|----------|
| Mainnet | `grpc.mainnet.sui.io:443` |
| Testnet | `grpc.testnet.sui.io:443` |
| Devnet  | `grpc.devnet.sui.io:443` |

**Protocol 119 Notes:**
- **New Move VM (Testnet Only):** Active on testnet, not mainnet. Account for gas metering differences in cross-network testing.
- **Offline Bytecode Dump:** `sui move build --dump --no-tree-shaking` works offline — enables air-gapped deployment pipelines.
- **Compatibility verification** enabled by default (was opt-in).

## Deployment Stages

### Stage 1: Devnet
```bash
sui client switch --env devnet
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```
Quick iteration, no verification needed.

### Stage 2: Testnet
```bash
sui client switch --env testnet
sui move test              # run all tests first
sui client publish --gas-budget 200000000
```
Public testing, 48+ hours soak time before mainnet.

### Stage 3: Mainnet
```bash
sui client switch --env mainnet
sui client publish --gas-budget 500000000
```
Requires: security audit, multisig UpgradeCap transfer, rollback plan.

## Upgrade Management

```bash
# Step 1: Build upgrade bytecode
sui move build --dump-bytecode-as-base64

# Step 2: Execute upgrade with existing UpgradeCap
sui client upgrade --gas-budget 200000000 --upgrade-capability <UPGRADE_CAP_ID>
```

**UpgradeCap best practices:**
- Transfer to multisig address immediately after first publish
- Store the cap object ID in your deployment records
- Use `sui client object <CAP_ID>` to verify cap ownership

## Post-Deployment Checklist

1. Save published **package ID** and **UpgradeCap ID**
2. Transfer UpgradeCap to multisig/admin address
3. Update frontend `.env` with new package ID
4. Run smoke tests against deployed package
5. Verify on-chain bytecode via explorer (Suivision / Suiscan)

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Forgetting to transfer UpgradeCap** — stuck in deployer address, cannot upgrade with multisig later. Transfer immediately after publish.

❌ **Not saving deployment artifacts** — lost package IDs mean you can't verify on-chain code or reference it. Save package ID + upgrade cap ID + tx digest.

❌ **Not updating frontend package IDs** — frontend calls old package, all transactions fail. Automate package ID updates in `.env` post-deployment.

See [reference.md](references/reference.md) for upgrade compatibility rules and [examples.md](references/examples.md) for deployment scripts.
