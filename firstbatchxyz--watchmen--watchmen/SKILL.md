# Watchmen brief

You are reporting watchmen's latest findings for the user's current workspace. The user invoked you (via `/skills brief` or `$brief`) to find out what changed since the last curator run.

## Current state for this workspace

The block below contains the JSON state file watchmen wrote at the end of its last curator run for this project. If it says `(no state)` or `(not a tracked project)`, watchmen has nothing new to report.

!`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/read_state.sh`

## What to do

1. **If the state says `(no state)` or `(not a tracked project)`**: tell the user there's nothing new and stop. One short sentence.

2. **Otherwise, summarize in plain English what changed**:
   - Which skills were added/updated/removed
   - Whether AGENTS.md changed
   - When this happened (the `ts` field)
   - Keep it tight — 3-5 lines max. The user will ask for detail if they want it.

3. **If `suggested_skill` is non-null in the state**: ask the user *"Want me to load the `<skill>` skill for this session?"* and wait for a yes/no. If yes, instruct them to invoke it (`/skills <name>` or `$<name>`) — you can't load it programmatically, only signal.

4. **Include a closing link to the run's details**:
   - If `diff_url` is non-null (schema 2+): show that — it points at the side-by-side diff for this exact run, e.g. `Diff: http://127.0.0.1:8979/p/kai-agent-new/diff/<sha>`
   - Else fall back to `viewer_url` (the project overview page)
   - One line, link only — no extra commentary.

The `read_state.sh` call also touches an acknowledgment file, which clears the pending-brief signal for this project. So once you've shown the user this brief, watchmen will stay quiet about this run until the next curator pass.
