# Rust — Idiomatic Systems Programming

You write idiomatic, production-grade Rust. The compiler is your collaborator, not your enemy.
When the borrow checker rejects code, the **design** is wrong — restructure, don't fight.

This SKILL.md is the entry point. Depth lives in the reference files listed at the bottom.
Read this file end-to-end when attached; open a reference file only when the task enters that
sub-area.

## 0. The canonical reference is the std library itself — but custom is encouraged

The doctrines in this skill (core/alloc/std tier, method chaining, trait
justification, orphan rule, module organization, free-fn roles) are observed
from how `core`, `alloc`, and `std` are built — not invented. **But this is
not a "defer to std" rule, and it is absolutely not "rewrite functionality
std already provides."** It's two-tier:

### Tier 1 — std's SURFACE: use it; don't reinvent it

If std provides a function, type, or trait that solves your actual problem,
USE IT. Re-implementing is the dedup failure mode.

- `core::cmp::min(a, b)` — not `pub fn min<T>(a: T, b: T) -> T`.
- `Vec<T>` — not `MyVec<T>` unless newtype-for-orphan-rule.
- `core::iter::Iterator` — implement it on your type, don't define a parallel `MyIterator`.
- `core::future::Future`, `core::fmt::Display`, `core::error::Error` — same rule.

Grep before defining (the memory ledger has a "canonical types already exist" feedback rule for this). The grep includes std.

### Tier 2 — std's GRAMMAR: adopt it for custom designs

For problems std DOESN'T solve (your domain types — `Bot`, `Decision`, `Allocator`,
domain-specific aggregators, etc.), design **custom** abstractions in std's grammar:

- **Chainable methods** returning `Self` or a derived type (Iterator/Option/Result/builder shape).
- **Traits with associated types** for extension points (the `Iterator::Item` shape).
- **Sealed marker traits** for closed-set type-level claims (the `Send`/`Sync` shape).
- **Operator overloading via `core::ops::*`** for natural domain syntax.
- **Newtype wrapping** for orphan-rule + invariant encoding (`NonZeroU32`/`Reverse<T>` shape).
- **`mod utils`** for stateless reusable bits (`core::mem::swap` shape).
- **`pub(crate)` defaults** for cross-module helpers (audit std source — every crate uses this).
- **`mod.rs` directories** vs **single-file modules** matched to scale (`core/src/iter/` vs `core/src/option.rs`).

These are GRAMMATICAL patterns. They tell you HOW to shape custom things, not
WHAT to build. Custom design is encouraged — even necessary — for things std
doesn't cover. The discipline is keeping that custom design in std's idiom so
borrow checker, consumers, and future agents all read it without surprise.

### The decision flow

1. **Does std already provide this?** Grep `core::`/`alloc::`/`std::` docs + source. If yes → USE std.
2. **Does std provide an analogous pattern for a different domain?** Your need is iterator-like, future-like, error-like? → IMPLEMENT std's trait on your domain type. Don't redefine the trait.
3. **Does an existing workspace struct ALMOST do this?** (Most common case mid-task.) → ADD the missing method to its `impl` block in the same crate. 5-15 min detour, then return to the original task. Don't define a parallel type. Don't refactor surrounding code. See `feedback_extend_existing_structs_stay_on_task.md`.
4. **Does std provide neither AND no workspace analog exists?** → DESIGN custom in std's grammar (chainable, associated types, sealed markers, `pub(crate)` defaults, four-tier module layout).

Step 3 is the workflow-level discipline that prevents the dedup ledger from
accumulating: the 15-minute detour into an existing impl block beats the 200-LOC
parallel rewrite every time. Step 4 is the actual custom-design work for things
no existing type covers — and is encouraged for domain-specific abstractions.

### Files worth reading once for the grammar

`core/src/iter/traits/iterator.rs`, `core/src/option.rs`, `core/src/result.rs`,
`core/src/cmp.rs`, `core/src/marker.rs`, `core/src/ops/arith.rs`,
`core/src/convert/mod.rs`, `core/src/mem.rs`, `core/src/fmt/mod.rs`,
`std/src/process.rs` (the `Command` builder).

See `feedback_study_rust_std_as_canonical_reference.md` for the full pattern map.

## I. Ownership & Borrowing (The Foundation)

Everything in Rust has exactly one owner. This isn't a limitation — it's a design tool.

### Rules

1. Each value has one owner. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.
2. You can have EITHER one `&mut T` OR any number of `&T` — never both simultaneously.
3. References must always be valid (no dangling pointers, enforced at compile time).

### Common Patterns

```rust
// MOVE: ownership transfers — original is invalid after this
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;  // s1 is MOVED into s2. s1 is now invalid.

// BORROW: temporary read access — original stays valid
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let len = calculate_length(&s1);  // borrows s1, doesn't move it
println!("{s1} has length {len}"); // s1 still valid

// MUTABLE BORROW: temporary exclusive write access
let mut s = String::from("hello");
change(&mut s);  // exclusive mutable borrow

fn calculate_length(s: &str) -> usize { s.len() }
fn change(s: &mut String) { s.push_str(", world"); }
```

### Traps

- `for item in vec` **moves** the vec. Use `for item in &vec` or `.iter()` to borrow.
- `String` moved into function → pass `&str` for read-only access.
- Can't return `&T` pointing to local data — return owned `T` instead.
- Split borrows: `let (a, b) = slice.split_at_mut(n);` for simultaneous `&mut` to different parts.

Deep dive: `ownership-borrowing.md`.

---

## II. Lifetimes

Lifetimes tell the compiler how long references are valid. Usually inferred; annotate when ambiguous.

```rust
// Explicit: output lifetime tied to input
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
}

// Struct holding a reference needs a lifetime parameter
struct Excerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
}

// 'static means the reference CAN live for the entire program
// String is 'static-capable (it owns its data)
// &'static str = string literal or leaked memory
```

### When to Use `'static`

- String literals: `"hello"` is `&'static str`
- Thread spawns: `std::thread::spawn` requires `'static` (no borrowed data)
- Trait objects: `Box<dyn Trait + 'static>` when you need ownership
- **Don't** slap `'static` everywhere to shut up the compiler — it means you're hiding a design issue.

---

## III. Error Handling

### Library Code — Custom Errors with `thiserror`

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Debug, Error)]
pub enum MyError {
    #[error("network request failed: {0}")]
    Network(#[from] reqwest::Error),

    #[error("invalid data: {msg}")]
    InvalidData { msg: String },

    #[error("not found: {0}")]
    NotFound(String),
}

// Use ? for propagation
fn fetch_data(url: &str) -> Result<Data, MyError> {
    let resp = reqwest::blocking::get(url)?;  // auto-converts via From
    let data = parse(resp).map_err(|e| MyError::InvalidData { msg: e.to_string() })?;
    Ok(data)
}
```

### Binary Code — `anyhow` for Convenience

```rust
use anyhow::{Context, Result};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let config = load_config()
        .context("failed to load config")?;
    run(config)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Rules

- **Never `.unwrap()` in library code or event loops.** Use `?`, `.unwrap_or_default()`, or explicit match.
- `.unwrap()` is acceptable in `main()`, startup, and tests.
- `.expect("reason")` > `.unwrap()` when the invariant matters.
- Chain `?` liberally — it's Rust's primary error propagation mechanism.
- Libraries return concrete `Error` types (`thiserror`-derived); binaries collapse to `anyhow::Result`. Don't mix at boundaries.

Deep dive: `errors-iteration.md`.

## IV. Traits & Generics

Traits define behavior. Generics make it reusable.

```rust
// Define behavior
pub trait Driver: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn evaluate(&self, ctx: &EvalContext) -> Signal;
}

// Use generics with trait bounds
fn run_driver<D: Driver>(driver: &D, ctx: &EvalContext) -> Signal {
    driver.evaluate(ctx)
}

// Or impl Trait (simpler for single-use)
fn run_driver(driver: &impl Driver, ctx: &EvalContext) -> Signal {
    driver.evaluate(ctx)
}

// Complex bounds → where clause
fn process<T, E>(item: T) -> Result<(), E>
where
    T: Driver + Clone + 'static,
    E: std::error::Error + Send,
{
    // ...
}
```

### Derive Macros — Use Aggressively

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
pub struct Signal {
    pub direction: f64,
    pub confidence: f64,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}

// With serde (feature-gated)
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "serde", derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize))]
pub struct Candle {
    pub open: f64,
    pub high: f64,
    pub low: f64,
    pub close: f64,
    pub volume: f64,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

Generics, trait objects, `impl Trait`, associated types, GATs, const generics, variance,
object safety, and type-state patterns are the *typespace* — how Rust lets you trade static
vs dynamic dispatch and encode invariants in types. That deserves its own file: `typespace.md`.

### The Rust design spectrum — method chaining first

Before "when not to use a trait," the deeper question: **what shape SHOULD the logic take?**
The function-first instinct (writing `pub fn foo(args) -> Result` for any new logic)
misses Rust's grain. Rust's "functional" character is the **chaining of methods** —
iterators, builders, futures, sinks — each link a small bit of logic, evaluated in
sequence, often lazily.

The design spectrum, in order of preference:

| Tier | Shape | When |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Method on a struct/enum, often returning another type for chaining** | The default. Iterators, builders, futures, fluent APIs. Bulk of code lives here. |
| 2 | **Struct + methods (no chain)** | State involved, no chain natural — accumulator, config, connection. `&self` / `&mut self` / `self`. |
| 3 | **Trait + impls** | Extension point — see decision tree below. |
| 4 | **Free fn — public utility API** | Small, stateless, called from many unrelated places. Lives in `utils.rs`. THESE are the API surface. |
| 5 | **Free fn — private helper** | Small, stateless, backs ONE struct's methods. Same file as the struct. Stays private. |

Free functions are tiers 4-5, NOT tier 1. The "I have a thing to do, I'll write a
function" instinct misses tiers 1-3 — which is where the bulk of Rust code belongs
because data almost always belongs to a type, and methods on that type chain to
produce results.

#### Function-first → method-chain (the most common mistake)

WRONG (free-floating functions threading state through args):
```rust
pub fn compute_kelly_fraction(bet: f64, capital: f64, edge: f64) -> f64 { /* ... */ }
pub fn clamp_kelly(f: f64, max: f64) -> f64 { f.min(max).max(0.0) }

let f = compute_kelly_fraction(bet, capital, edge);
let f = clamp_kelly(f, 0.5);
```

RIGHT (state in a struct, methods chain):
```rust
pub struct KellyClob { bet: f64, capital: f64 }

impl KellyClob {
    pub fn fraction(&self, edge: f64) -> f64 { /* ... */ }
    pub fn clamped(self, max: f64) -> Self { /* returns Self — chainable */ }
    pub fn validated(self) -> Result<Self, Error> { /* ... */ }
    pub fn into_size(self) -> f64 { /* terminal */ }
}

let size = KellyClob::new(bet, capital)
    .clamped(0.5)
    .validated()?
    .into_size();
```

Method chaining generalizes beyond iterators. HTTP requests, builders, futures,
fluent SQL — all the same pattern: methods return `Self` (or a derived type) so
the next method attaches. The caller reads top-to-bottom what's happening to the
value.

#### Iterator-style chaining IS Rust's "functional" idiom

```rust
let active: Vec<_> = bot_registry
    .iter()
    .filter(|b| b.power == Power::On)
    .filter(|b| matches!(b.mode, BotMode::Paper | BotMode::Live))
    .map(|b| b.summary())
    .take(10)
    .collect();
```

Lazy until `.collect()`. Each link composable, swappable, refactorable. THIS
is what "Rust is functional" means — not "use lots of free functions."

#### When free functions ARE right

Two roles, both legitimate:

**Role A — Public utility API (utils.rs / helpers.rs):**
```rust
// crates/core/src/time/utils.rs
pub fn now_micros() -> i64 { /* ... */ }
pub fn align_to_5min(t: i64) -> i64 { /* ... */ }
```
Stateless, reusable across dozens of call sites, no `Self` to attach to.

**Role B — Private helper backing struct methods (same file):**
```rust
impl Decision {
    pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        check_market_id(&self.market_id)?;
        check_kelly_f(self.kelly_f)?;
        Ok(())
    }
}
fn check_market_id(s: &str) -> Result<(), Error> { /* private */ }
fn check_kelly_f(f: Option<f64>) -> Result<(), Error> { /* private */ }
```
Private free fns break up a method's body without competing with the public API.

**Role C — Framework requirement (follow the framework's API surface):**
```rust
// wasm-bindgen demands free fns
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet(name: &str) -> String { format!("Hello, {name}") }

// axum demands free fn handlers with extractor args
async fn get_bots(
    State(state): State<AppState>,
    Query(params): Query<BotQuery>,
) -> Result<Json<Vec<BotSummary>>, StatusCode> { /* ... */ }
```
But other frameworks demand structure (tarpc → trait + impl on a struct; clap → struct
with derive macros). Lesson: don't fight the framework. The right shape is what its
macros / codegen expect.

**Bonus pattern — `pub fn run` in lib.rs for clean bin split:**
```rust
// crates/<name>/src/lib.rs — the app-specific SDK
pub fn run() -> anyhow::Result<()> { /* config, services, supervisor, bind */ }
```
```rust
// bin/<crate>/bin/<app>.rs — thin shim
fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> { init_tracing()?; <crate>::run() }
```
`pub fn run` is unit-testable; `fn main` isn't. `lib.rs` compiles to multiple targets;
the bin doesn't have to. The lib becomes the SDK; the bin becomes the entry shim.

**Workspace bin layout convention** (project-specific): `bin/<crate>/src/` is the SDK
(`[lib] path = "src/lib.rs"`); `bin/<crate>/bin/<app>.rs` is the binary entry
(`[[bin]] path = "bin/<app>.rs"`). A workspace member can ship multiple binaries by
adding more `[[bin]]` entries — all sharing the same `src/` SDK.

#### The Forward<T> canonical pattern (when a trait IS earned)

```rust
pub trait Forward<T> {
    type Output;
    fn forward(self, input: T) -> Self::Output;
}

// Owning model — consumes self
impl<X> Forward<f64> for Model<X> where X: Layer { type Output = f64; ... }

// Reference impl — model stays alive across multiple .forward() calls
impl<X> Forward<f64> for &Model<X> where X: Layer { type Output = f64; ... }

// Generic over input/output — composable across the layer chain
impl<X, Y, Z> Forward<Y> for &Model<X>
where X: Layer<Input = Y, Output = Z> {
    type Output = Z;
    fn forward(self, input: Y) -> Z { /* ... */ }
}
```

Why both `Model<X>` AND `&Model<X>` impls: owning consumes; reference keeps the
model alive for repeated calls. The trait abstracts over both.

#### Lifetime composition in trait impls

When the impl needs to relate references, lifetimes appear in the impl block.
Clippy `needless_lifetimes` warns ONLY when they could be elided. When you need
them to express a relationship, use them:

```rust
impl<'a, X, Y, Z> core::ops::Add<State<&'a Y>> for State<&'a mut X>
where /* bounds connecting X, Y, Z */
{
    type Output = Z;
    fn add(self, rhs: State<&'a Y>) -> Z { /* ... */ }
}
```

Reading: `'a` ties the mutable borrow of `X` to the immutable borrow of `Y`; both
must outlive the operation. `State<&'a mut X> + State<&'a Y> → Z`. Operator
overloading via standard `core::ops::Add` — gets you `+` syntax for free.

Deep dive: see `feedback_rust_design_spectrum.md` for the full doctrine including
the decision flow and anti-patterns table.

### When NOT to use a trait

A trait must justify itself. Valid justifications (any one suffices):

1. **Associated types abstract over impl-specific shapes** (`Iterator::Item`).
2. **`Self`-abstraction enables generic code** (`Add<Rhs = Self>`, `From<T>`).
3. **Multiple types implement it as an extension point** (`Display`, `Debug`, `Drop`).
4. **Marker semantics** (`Send`, `Sync`, `Copy`, sealed marker traits).
5. **Trait-object dispatch is the consumer's API** (`Box<dyn Plugin>`).
6. **Sealed repr markers** — private type-system contracts (`ndarray::RawData`: Owned/Shared/View). Generic code parameterizes over the marker; sealed prevents downstream invention.
7. **HKT via Generic Associated Types (GATs)** — `type Item<'a> where Self: 'a` for borrow-from-self iteration. Stable since 1.65.
8. **Generic binary/n-ary operators** — `trait Binary<T> { type Output; fn op(self, rhs: T) -> Self::Output; }`, companion to `core::ops::Add` etc.
9. **Trait-extends-std pattern** — define the trait in a foundational crate (`crates/traits`), blanket-impl it on external types (`Vec`, `ndarray::ArrayBase`, …) cfg-gated; downstream consumers get the impls automatically.

If none of these hold, you are writing a method-bag, not a trait. Anti-pattern:

```rust
// BAD — concrete types in every signature; no Self-abstraction; no associated types;
// no extension point. Vec<f64> already has everything needed; the trait adds NOTHING.
pub trait Covariance {
    fn covariance(&self, other: &[f64]) -> f64;
    fn correlation(&self, other: &[f64]) -> f64;
}
```

Two correct shapes for the same logic:

```rust
// (a) Free function — generic over numeric type, reusable everywhere.
pub fn covariance<T: Float + Sum + Copy>(x: &[T], y: &[T]) -> T { /* ... */ }
pub fn correlation<T: Float + Sum + Copy>(x: &[T], y: &[T]) -> T { /* ... */ }

// (b) Struct + methods — when state is involved (incremental, batch).
pub struct CovarianceAccumulator<T: Float> { /* running state */ }
impl<T: Float> CovarianceAccumulator<T> {
    pub fn push(&mut self, x: T, y: T) { /* Welford update */ }
    pub fn covariance(&self) -> T { /* ... */ }
}
```

The decision tree, when tempted to declare a new trait:

| Question | Yes → trait | No → keep asking |
|---|---|---|
| Associated type that varies per impl? | trait | next |
| Self-abstraction non-trivially used? | trait | next |
| Multiple unrelated types will impl it? | trait | next |
| Marker (no behavior, just a type-level claim)? | trait | next |
| Trait-object dispatch is the API? | trait | **not a trait** |

If you fall through to "not a trait": stateless → free fn; stateful → struct + methods.

**Why this matters beyond style.** A method-bag trait that hardcodes concrete types
(`&[f64]`) is unreachable to consumers with different concrete types (`&[f32]`,
`&[Decimal]`). They will rewrite from scratch. Bad trait design is a leading CAUSE
of the duplicate-code failure mode. Generic free fns and struct methods don't have
this problem because consumers parameterize at the call site.

### The orphan rule (coherence) — where impls can live

`impl Trait for Type` is only allowed in crate `C` if **Trait is local to C** OR
**Type is local to C**. You CANNOT implement an external trait on an external type.

```rust
// In crates/traits — Binary IS local; ndarray::ArrayBase is external
pub trait Binary<T> { type Output; fn op(self, rhs: T) -> Self::Output; }

#[cfg(feature = "ndarray")]
impl<A, S, D, B, T> Binary<ndarray::ArrayBase<T, D>> for ndarray::ArrayBase<S, D>
where /* bounds */
{ /* ✅ ALLOWED — Binary is local */ }
```

```rust
// In a downstream crate — Binary is external; Tensor IS local
pub struct Tensor<A, D> { /* ... */ }
impl<A, B, D> Binary<Tensor<B, D>> for Tensor<A, D> { /* ✅ Tensor is local */ }
```

```rust
// Anywhere downstream — both external — FORBIDDEN
impl Binary<Vec<f64>> for Vec<f64> { /* ❌ orphan rule violation */ }
```

**Architectural consequence:** define a trait in the most foundational crate that
can reach the types you'd want to impl it on — typically a `crates/traits` (or
similarly named) no_std-capable crate at the root of the workspace. The crate that
defines the trait can blanket-impl it on `Vec`, `HashMap`, `ndarray::ArrayBase`, etc.
with cfg gates per dep — downstream sees those impls for free.

**This is why `core::ops::Add` lives in `core`** — so every downstream crate can
implement it on its own types and get `+` syntax. If `Add` were in some random
crate, only that crate could blanket-impl it on `i32`, `f64`, etc.

**Newtype workaround** — when you truly need `impl ExternalTrait for ExternalType`:

```rust
pub struct MyVec<T>(pub Vec<T>);

impl<T> core::fmt::Display for MyVec<T>
where T: core::fmt::Display
{
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut core::fmt::Formatter) -> core::fmt::Result { /* ... */ }
}
```

Local newtype gives the orphan-rule its locality and your code its impl. Cost: a
wrapper at the API boundary; users do `MyVec(some_vec)` to opt in.

(Note the path discipline above: `core::fmt::*` inline rather than `use std::fmt::{Display, Formatter}`. The order `core → alloc → std` is the **flagability ladder** — reach for the lowest tier that has the item. `core::net::SocketAddr`, `core::time::Duration`, `core::ops::Add`, `core::fmt::Display` are all `core`-tier; using their `std::` aliases blocks `no_std` consumers for zero gain. The same struct definition compiles across `no_std`/`alloc`/`std` when its imports stay at the lowest sufficient tier — that's why foundational crates near the root of a workspace's dependency graph win by reaching for `core::` reflexively, since they need to compile for every downstream tier. Inline single-use paths rather than importing.)

**Anti-pattern:** defining a trait downstream and then wanting to impl it on a
type from an upstream sibling crate. The orphan rule blocks this; the only fix is
to MOVE the trait definition upstream. So when designing a trait, ask first: what
types do I want this implementable on? — and define it where those types are
reachable.

Deep dive: see `feedback_orphan_rule_coherence.md` for full mechanics including
`#[fundamental]` types and the formal coherence rule.

## V. Async Rust (tokio)

```rust
// Async function
async fn fetch_price(url: &str) -> Result<f64> {
    let resp = reqwest::get(url).await?;
    let data: PriceResponse = resp.json().await?;
    Ok(data.price)
}

// Spawning tasks
let handle = tokio::spawn(async move {
    fetch_price("https://api.example.com/price").await
});
let price = handle.await??; // double ? — JoinError then inner Result

// Select — race multiple futures
tokio::select! {
    price = fetch_price("source_a") => { /* use price */ }
    _ = tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)) => { /* timeout */ }
}

// Shared state across tasks
let state = Arc::new(RwLock::new(AppState::default()));
let state_clone = state.clone();
tokio::spawn(async move {
    let mut guard = state_clone.write().await;
    guard.update();
});
```

### Async Traps

- **Don't hold `MutexGuard` across `.await`** — use tokio's `Mutex` or restructure.
- **`Rc` is not `Send`** — use `Arc` for anything crossing task boundaries.
- **Blocking in async** — use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking()` for CPU-heavy work.
- **`.await` is a yield point** — state can change between awaits.
- **Sync I/O in async functions** — use `tokio::fs` instead of `std::fs`.

Deep dive: `concurrency-memory.md`.

## VI. Strings

```rust
// String = owned, heap-allocated, growable
// &str = borrowed slice, immutable reference to string data
// &'static str = string literal, lives forever

let owned: String = String::from("hello");
let borrowed: &str = &owned;          // borrow
let literal: &str = "hello";          // static lifetime

// Prefer &str in function params (accepts both)
fn greet(name: &str) { println!("Hello, {name}"); }
greet(&owned);   // works
greet(literal);  // works

// String concatenation
let s = format!("{} {}", first, last);  // best — no moves
let s = owned + " world";              // moves owned!
```

### UTF-8 Traps

- `s[0]` **doesn't compile** — use `.chars().nth(0)` or `.as_bytes()[0]`
- `.len()` returns **bytes**, not characters — use `.chars().count()` for char count
- Slicing `&s[0..4]` can panic if it splits a multi-byte char

Deep dive: `types-strings.md`.

---

## VII. Iterators

Iterators are lazy — nothing executes until consumed.

```rust
// Three ways to iterate
for item in &vec      { /* borrows: &T */ }
for item in &mut vec  { /* mutable borrow: &mut T */ }
for item in vec       { /* moves/consumes: T */ }

// Chaining (lazy until collect/for_each/count/etc.)
let result: Vec<f64> = prices
    .iter()
    .filter(|p| **p > 0.0)
    .map(|p| p * 1.1)
    .collect();

// Turbofish for type inference
let sum = values.iter().sum::<f64>();
let grouped: HashMap<_, Vec<_>> = items.into_iter()
    .map(|x| (x.key, x.value))
    .into_group_map();  // from itertools
```

---

## VIII. Cargo & Feature Gates

For the full cargo surface — commands, `Cargo.toml` schema, workspaces,
`[profile.*]` tuning, `.cargo/config.toml`, registries, the subcommand
ecosystem (clippy/rustfmt/expand/nextest/deny/audit/hack/machete/component/etc.),
sccache, and machine-readable output — see `cargo.md` in this skill.

Four feature-graph rules to memorize:

- **Features are additive.** Cargo unifies features across the dep graph;
  "feature A XOR feature B" breaks downstream.
- **Every new dependency gets its own named feature.** Use `dep:` syntax
  (`json = ["dep:serde_json"]`) so the dep doesn't auto-expose as a
  feature with its own name.
- **`<dep>?/<feat>`** forwards `<feat>` only when `<dep>` is already
  enabled — the cleanest way to propagate downstream features through
  optional deps.
- **`default-features = false` at workspace level;** enable what you need
  per-crate. Minimizes default compile surface.

The `no_std` / `alloc` / `std` three-tier system for library crates and
the canonical sealed-trait + cfg-gated impl pattern are documented in
`cargo.md §4`.

## IX. Parallel Agent Build Workflows

The full operational discipline — `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` per-agent isolation,
git-worktree-based lane isolation, `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` throttling, scoped
checks vs `--workspace`, wave-gate vs in-lane semantics, sccache for
shared compilation cache, machine-readable output gating, and the
canonical shell preamble with `trap … EXIT` cleanup — lives in
`cargo.md §9`.

Headline rules to memorize:

- **Never set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` globally.** Per-agent shell only.
- **Cargo holds a file lock on `target/`.** Two agents on the same
  `target/` serialize, error, or corrupt artifacts. Always isolate.
- **Wave-gates run serial** on the main `target/`; **in-lane checks are
  fully parallel** on per-agent `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.
- **Scope to `-p <crate>` inside lanes;** only the wave-gate touches
  `--workspace`.

For machine-readable output (`--message-format=json`, `cargo metadata`,
exit-code gates), see `cargo.md §10`.

## X. Patterns & Idioms

### Newtype Pattern

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
pub struct Confidence(pub f64);

impl Confidence {
    pub fn new(value: f64) -> Self {
        Self(value.clamp(0.0, 1.0))
    }
}
```

### Builder Pattern

```rust
pub struct ConfigBuilder {
    timeout: Option<Duration>,
    retries: Option<u32>,
}

impl ConfigBuilder {
    pub fn new() -> Self { Self { timeout: None, retries: None } }
    pub fn timeout(mut self, t: Duration) -> Self { self.timeout = Some(t); self }
    pub fn retries(mut self, n: u32) -> Self { self.retries = Some(n); self }
    pub fn build(self) -> Config {
        Config {
            timeout: self.timeout.unwrap_or(Duration::from_secs(30)),
            retries: self.retries.unwrap_or(3),
        }
    }
}
```

### Type-State Pattern

```rust
pub struct Connection<S> { inner: TcpStream, _state: PhantomData<S> }

pub struct Disconnected;
pub struct Connected;

impl Connection<Disconnected> {
    pub fn connect(self) -> Result<Connection<Connected>> { /* ... */ }
}

impl Connection<Connected> {
    pub fn send(&self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<()> { /* ... */ }
}
// Can't call .send() on Disconnected — compile error
```

### Interior Mutability (when needed)

```rust
// Single-threaded: RefCell
use std::cell::RefCell;
let data = RefCell::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
data.borrow_mut().push(4);  // panics if already borrowed!

// Multi-threaded: RwLock or Mutex
use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock};
let shared = Arc::new(RwLock::new(State::default()));
```

## XI. Module Organization & Visibility

Disciplined modules → flat, extractable, testable subsystems. Sloppy
organization → endless nesting (`crate::a::b::c::d::e::Item`) → unreadable
code. The full doctrine — four-tier promotion ladder, inline-module
convention, visibility ladder, path discipline, naming-depth smells —
lives in `module-organization.md`.

Headline rules:

- **Four-tier promotion ladder:** `inline` → `file` → `mod.rs` → `crate`.
  Promote when a tier exceeds its capacity (~200 LOC inline, cohesive
  submodules at file, independent compile/test cadence at mod.rs).
- **Inline modules carry roles:** `mod types` for public types, `mod
  traits` for traits, `mod impls` (private — never re-exported) for impl
  blocks, `mod utils` for private helpers.
- **`pub(crate)` is the default** for cross-module helpers. Prefer it
  over `pub(super)`, which breaks on every file move.
- **Absolute paths over relative:** `use crate::foo::bar` beats
  `use super::super::foo::bar`. `super::super::` is a refactor signal.
- **Naming-depth ceiling:** std hardly nests past depth 3
  (`std::collections::hash_map::HashMap`). If your path is deeper than
  std nests anywhere, the response is `pub use`-flatten, promote-to-crate,
  or re-home.

The full discipline (with worked examples, the inline `mod impls/types/
traits/utils` convention, and migration recipes) is in
`module-organization.md`.

## XII. When to Extract a Crate

A module wants to be its own crate when any of:

- Its public API is stable and consumed by ≥2 other workspace members.
- Its compile cost dominates the build and gating it behind a feature isn't sufficient.
- Its test suite is large enough to meaningfully slow the parent crate's iteration.
- It has an independent versioning story (serde, for example, ships on its own cadence).
- It has a clear `pub fn serve()` / `pub fn start()` entry point — a service boundary.

Extraction is reversible. If a split stops paying for itself, fold it back. The unit of
reasoning is "does this have a life of its own" — not "is it big enough yet."

---

## XIII. Unsafe

Rust lets you opt out of compile-time safety checks inside `unsafe` blocks. The contract:
the compiler stops proving safety; you prove it, in the surrounding comment, by hand.

```rust
// SAFETY: `ptr` is non-null because we just allocated it above;
// `len` is 8 bytes matching the layout; no other reference aliases `ptr`
// for the duration of this block (we hold the only &mut).
let value = unsafe { *ptr };
```

Rules for `unsafe`:

- **Every `unsafe` block must have a `// SAFETY:` comment** explaining the invariants you are
  upholding by hand. If you can't write the comment, the unsafe is unjustified.
- **Keep unsafe surfaces minimal.** Wrap unsafe behind a safe API at the crate boundary; callers
  should never need `unsafe`.
- **Prefer safe abstractions** (`std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut`, `Pin`, `NonNull`) over hand-
  rolled pointer arithmetic. They exist because safe idioms lose less often than you'd think.
- **`unsafe impl Send for X`** means you are asserting `X` is thread-transferable — a claim the
  compiler would otherwise reject. Document why it's sound (no interior `Rc`, no pthread state, …).
- **FFI requires `unsafe`.** Generated bindings (`bindgen`, `cxx`) wrap the unsafe surface with
  safer Rust wrappers. Consumers of your FFI crate should only need the safe surface.

Advanced material: `advanced-traps.md`.

## XIV. Macros

Two macro systems, both compile-time, both generating code the compiler
then type-checks as normal Rust. Full depth — fragment-specifier tables,
hygiene rules, recursive `macro_rules!`, proc-macro crate structure,
syn/quote/proc-macro2 patterns, helper attributes, `trybuild` testing
— lives in `macros.md`.

The three flavors and what each can do:

| Flavor | Signature | Power |
|---|---|---|
| `macro_rules!` (declarative) | pattern-based | Variadic calls, table-driven tests, DSL syntax. Partially hygienic. |
| `#[derive(X)]` (proc-macro) | `fn(TokenStream) -> TokenStream` | **Appends** an impl block. Cannot modify the annotated item. |
| `#[attribute]` (proc-macro) | `fn(attr, item) -> TokenStream` | **Replaces** the item — can modify, wrap, or rewrite it. |
| `function_like!()` (proc-macro) | `fn(TokenStream) -> TokenStream` | Full control — input need not be valid Rust. |

When to reach for which:
- **Prefer a function** unless you need syntactic positions a function
  can't reach: new bindings, control flow, type-level manipulation, or
  repetition over heterogeneous types.
- **`macro_rules!` for:** variadic calls, table-driven test generation,
  compile-time assertions, small DSLs.
- **Proc macros for:** deriving trait impls, code generation from schemas,
  annotating functions with instrumentation/routing/validation.
- **Never hide control flow** in a macro (a silent `return` or `break` is
  invisible at the call site).

Deep dive: `macros.md` — fragment specifier table, hygiene rules, recursive
macros, proc-macro crate structure with the syn/quote/proc-macro2 triad,
field iteration patterns, helper attributes, `trybuild` testing, re-export
convention.

## XV. Common Compiler Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `value moved here` | Used after move | Clone or borrow |
| `cannot borrow as mutable` | Already borrowed | Restructure or interior mutability |
| `missing lifetime specifier` | Ambiguous reference | Add `<'a>` annotations |
| `the trait bound is not satisfied` | Missing impl | Check trait bounds, add derives |
| `type annotations needed` | Can't infer type | Turbofish `::<T>` or explicit binding |
| `cannot move out of borrowed content` | Deref moves | Clone or pattern match with `ref` |
| `temporary value dropped while borrowed` | Ref to temp | Bind to variable first |
| `expected X, found Y` | Type mismatch | Check From/Into impls, add conversion |
| `the size for values of type ... cannot be known at compilation time` | `dyn Trait` without indirection | `Box`, `Arc`, or `&dyn` |
| `future cannot be sent between threads safely` | Held non-`Send` across await | Drop guard before await, or use `tokio::Mutex` |

---

## XVI. Testing

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_basic() {
        let result = add(2, 3);
        assert_eq!(result, 5);
    }

    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected = "overflow")]
    fn test_panic() {
        add(u32::MAX, 1);
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_async() {
        let price = fetch_price().await.unwrap();
        assert!(price > 0.0);
    }
}
```

Testing discipline:

- **Unit tests live next to the code** (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`) and can see private items.
- **Integration tests live in `tests/`** at the crate root and exercise only the public API.
- **Compile-time assertions** (`static_assertions`) catch regressions at `cargo check` time —
  cheap, proactive.
- **Doc tests** for every non-trivial public function. Hidden setup uses `#` prefix.

---

## XVII. Performance Quick Hits

- **Release builds are 10–100× faster** than debug. Always `--release` for benchmarks.
- `Vec::with_capacity(n)` when you know the size — avoids reallocations.
- `&[T]` over `&Vec<T>` in function params — more general, same perf.
- `Box<dyn Trait>` for dynamic dispatch, `impl Trait` for static dispatch (monomorphized).
- `#[inline]` on small hot-path functions — but don't cargo-cult it, the compiler is usually right.
- `Arc::clone()` is cheap (atomic increment) — don't contort code to avoid it.
- Profile before optimizing. `cargo flamegraph` for CPU, `dhat` for allocations.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Better Approach |
|---|---|
| Over-cloning to bypass the borrow checker | Use references `&T` or restructure ownership |
| `Arc<Mutex<T>>` everywhere | Single owner + `&mut`, or channels for message-passing |
| `.unwrap()` in library code | Return `Result<T, E>` and let the caller handle it |
| Sync I/O in `async fn` | Use `tokio::fs`, `tokio::net`, or `spawn_blocking` |
| `Box<dyn Error>` at library boundaries | `thiserror`-derived concrete error enum |
| `.clone()` as a fix for a borrow error | Ask whether the design wants different ownership |

### Ecosystem — docs.rs is the source of truth

This skill deliberately does NOT ship per-crate cheatsheets. Crate APIs drift; a local file
rots the moment a minor version bumps. Go to the canonical indexes:

- **`https://docs.rs/{crate}/latest/{crate}/all.html`** — every item the crate exports on one
  page. Fastest way to see what exists before coding against it.
- **`https://docs.rs/crate/{crate}/latest/features`** — full feature matrix for a given
  version, including which features pull in which deps.
- **`https://crates.io/crates/{crate}`** — version history, reverse deps, source links.

Reach for those over memory whenever the question is "does this crate have X?" or "what
features does X gate?". Examples: `docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/all.html`,
`docs.rs/crate/axum/latest/features`, `docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/all.html`.

### Related skills

- **`code-style`** (sibling skill) — personal preferences layer (MSRV floor, hashbrown over
  std HashMap, the user's preferred module convention, naming idioms). Load it whenever
  producing Rust the user will read — this skill stays project- and style-agnostic.
- **`webassembly`** (sibling skill) — language-agnostic WebAssembly: WIT syntax, component
  model semantics, WASI capability model, binary format. Cross to it for "what does this
  WIT contract MEAN" / "what capabilities does this component need".
- **`wasmtime`** (sibling skill) — Rust-side host embedding: `Engine`/`Store`/`Linker`/
  `Component`, `bindgen!` macro, WASI capability grants, `&self` ergonomics via `Mutex`. Cross
  to it for any host-side WASM runtime question.
- **`workflow`** (sibling skill) — branching conventions, GH issue/PR/milestone management,
  CI/CD patterns, Rust workspace scaffolding, sprint/phase structure.

For the Rust-side WASM toolchain (target flags, `cargo-component` CLI, `wit-bindgen` macro
syntax, `wasm-bindgen` browser interop) — go to docs.rs for the crate or to the
`webassembly` / `wasmtime` skills. No per-tool cheatsheets live in this skill.
