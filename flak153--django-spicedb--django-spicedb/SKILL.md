description: Implement django-spicedb in Django application code. Use for translating authorization rules into RebacModel/RebacMeta definitions, choosing FK/M2M/through bindings, wiring runtime checks and queryset filtering, and handling schema publish and tuple sync safely. Use when this capability is needed.

# Django Spicedb

## Overview

Use this skill when the task is application integration of `django-spicedb`.
The target is Django app code: models, service layer, and runtime permission calls.

Do not use this skill for modifying internals under `django_spicedb/`; use `$django-spicedb-contributor` for that scope.

## How The Library Works

### Authorization pipeline

1. Models inheriting `RebacModel` are registered by `RebacModelBase`.
2. Optional external subject/resource models are registered with `register_type(...)`.
3. `RebacMeta` definitions are compiled into a type graph (`get_type_graph()`).
4. The type graph is compiled to SpiceDB schema and published with `publish_schema(...)`.
5. FK/M2M/through changes trigger tuple sync handlers.
6. Runtime checks are evaluated through `can(...)`, `.has_perm(...)`, and `.accessible_by(...)`.

### Binding semantics

1. FK binding: one row points to one related subject/resource.
2. M2M binding: many direct links with no role dimension.
3. Through binding: relation value is derived from a role field in a join table.

Use through bindings whenever role transitions must change authorization (`member` vs `manager`).

## Implementation Workflow

### 1) Gather inputs before coding

Collect these from the task/request:

1. subject types (`User`, `ServiceAccount`, `Group`)
2. protected resource types (`Document`, `Folder`, `Verification`)
3. direct relations (`owner`, `parent`, `member`, `manager`)
4. inheritance needs (`parent->view`, `workspace->edit`)
5. tenancy constraints (single tenant vs tenant-scoped checks)
6. write paths used by the app (`save`, M2M add/remove, through writes, `bulk_create`, `QuerySet.update`)

### 2) Convert business rules into relation/permission graph

Translate plain-English policy to type-level rules first.

Example translation:

1. "Owners can edit documents." -> relation `owner`, permission `edit = owner`
2. "Workspace managers can edit workspace documents." -> document relation to workspace, `edit` includes `workspace->edit`
3. "Folder access cascades to children." -> relation `parent`, permission includes `parent->view`

Keep permission expressions small and composable.

### 3) Implement models and `RebacMeta`

For each protected model:

1. inherit from `RebacModel`
2. add `objects = RebacManager()`
3. define `RebacMeta.type_name`, `relations`, and `permissions`
4. for role-based memberships, define `RebacMeta.through` and set through model manager to `RebacThroughManager()`

### 4) Publish schema after relation/permission changes

Use this command:

```bash
python manage.py shell -c "import django_spicedb.conf as conf; from django_spicedb.adapters import factory; from django_spicedb.schema import publish_schema; print(publish_schema(factory.get_adapter(), graph=conf.get_type_graph()))"
```

### 5) Wire runtime checks in service-layer boundaries

Use service functions as policy boundaries rather than spreading checks ad hoc in every view.

1. read endpoints: check `view`
2. mutation endpoints: check `edit` or `manage`
3. list endpoints: use `.accessible_by(...)` for server-side filtering

### 6) Keep write paths sync-safe

Preferred write paths:

1. `instance.save()`
2. M2M manager methods (`add`, `remove`, `clear`)
3. through-row create/save/delete with `RebacThroughManager`
4. manager `bulk_create` where sync helpers are supported

Use caution with `QuerySet.update` on authorization-relevant fields; use safer writes when possible.

### 7) Rollout discipline

1. publish schema before switching runtime checks
2. cut runtime guards over to `can`/`has_perm`/`accessible_by`
3. keep operational reconcile workflow documented for tuple drift recovery

## Worked Example 1: Tenant Workspace + Folder + Document

This pattern covers:

1. tenant-scoped workspace membership via through roles
2. folder inheritance
3. document inheritance from workspace and folder
4. service-layer runtime checks and queryset filtering

## Worked Example 2: Group Membership Roles + Verification Workflow

This pattern covers:

2. verification resources inheriting group permissions
3. role transitions affecting `manage`
4. service-layer checks for submit/approve/reject flows

    ]

    group = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="verifications")
    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="owned_verifications")
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
