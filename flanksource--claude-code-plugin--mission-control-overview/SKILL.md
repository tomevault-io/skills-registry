## What Is Mission Control?

Flanksource Mission Control is an Internal Developer Platform that helps teams improve developer productivity and operational resilience.

With Mission Control you can:

- [Catalog](https://flanksource.com/docs/guide/config-db) and track changes on infrastructure, applications and configuration.
- [Empower Developers](https://flanksource.com/docs/guide/playbooks) with self-service playbooks for Day 0-2 operations.
- [Run Health Checks](https://flanksource.com/docs/guide/canary-checker) across both cloud-native and legacy infrastructure and applications.
- [Incrementally Adopt GitOps](https://flanksource.com/docs/guide/playbooks/actions/gitops) with playbooks that perform Git commits in the background.
- Aggregate Alerts from [Prometheus](https://flanksource.com/docs/guide/canary-checker/reference/alert-manager), [Cloudwatch](https://flanksource.com/docs/guide/canary-checker/reference/aws-cloudwatch), etc.
- [Build Event Driven Control Planes](https://flanksource.com/docs/guide/playbooks/actions/gitops) with a combination of webhooks, events and GitOps.
- [Notify People and Systems](https://flanksource.com/docs/guide/notifications) about changes in health and configuration.

Mission Control itself adds orchestration, automation, and a web UI on top of these engines via its own CRDs:

3. Add a **ScrapePlugin** for global change filtering/mapping/retention
4. Create **Notification** routing for key events
5. Create **NotificationSilence** windows for maintenance
6. Create **Playbooks** for self-service automation
