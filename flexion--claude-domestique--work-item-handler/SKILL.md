# Work Item Handler

Integrate with issue trackers (GitHub, JIRA, Azure DevOps) for context-aware assistance.

## When to Use This Skill

Proactively invoke when user:
- Mentions an issue number
- Asks about requirements or "what needs to be done"
- Needs to fetch/refresh issue details
- Is unclear about task scope

## Context Files (Auto-Injected)

- **rules/git.md**: Commit and PR format rules (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- **context/git.md**: Detailed commit/PR examples
- **rules/work-items.md**: Work item lifecycle
- **context/work-items.md**: Multi-platform patterns and examples

Read these files for complete guidance. This skill provides quick reference only.

### Load Project Rules

Before proceeding, check for project-level rules that may override onus defaults:

1. **Scan for project rules**
   ```bash
   find .claude/rules -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. **If files found**, read any that relate to work items, issues, or the specific platform (match by filename, e.g. `work-items.md`, `jira.md`, by frontmatter `domain:` / `type:` fields, or by `extends: onus/work-items.md`)

3. **Check for companion context** — if a rule file's frontmatter contains a `companion:` field, also read that file from `.claude/context/`

4. **State the source**
   - "Using project rules from .claude/rules/{filename}" OR
   - "No project rules found, using onus defaults"

5. **Apply precedence**: project rules override plugin defaults

## Quick Reference

### Fetch Issue (GitHub)
```bash
gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,state,labels
```

### Use /onus:fetch Command
For full fetch with caching:
```
/onus:fetch 42
```

### Caching
- Location: `~/.claude/onus/work-item-cache.json`
- Expires: 1 hour
- Refresh: `/onus:fetch <number>`

## Key Rules

1. **Don't define commit/PR formats here** — that's rules/git.md's job
2. **Don't guess issue numbers** — verify with user or parse from branch
3. **Track acceptance criteria** — warn before PR if unaddressed

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Define commit message format (see rules/git.md, context/git.md)
- Define PR format (see rules/git.md, context/git.md)
- Define work item lifecycle (see rules/work-items.md)
- Provide detailed fetch examples (see context/work-items.md, commands/fetch.md)
