# Project Feasibility Analysis

## Overview

Feasibility analysis is a systematic process for evaluating whether a proposed software project is viable and worth pursuing. Assess technical feasibility, resource requirements, market viability, risk factors, and implementation challenges. Apply this skill to make informed go/no-go decisions before committing resources.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Evaluating new project proposals for viability
- Assessing technical feasibility of proposed features
- Analyzing resource requirements and constraints
- Conducting market viability assessments
- Identifying potential blockers and deal-breakers
- Comparing multiple project options
- Preparing feasibility reports for stakeholders

## Visual Enhancement with Project Diagrams

**When creating feasibility documents, consider adding diagrams for clarity.**

Use the **project-diagrams** skill to generate:
- Feasibility decision trees
- Risk assessment matrices
- Resource requirement diagrams
- Technical architecture feasibility maps
- Market positioning charts

```bash
python .claude/skills/project-diagrams/scripts/generate_schematic.py "diagram description" -o diagrams/output.png

## Feasibility Analysis Framework

Conduct feasibility analysis systematically through multiple dimensions.

### 1. Technical Feasibility

Evaluate whether the project can be built with available technology and expertise.

#### Technology Readiness Assessment

| Readiness Level | Description | Risk |
|-----------------|-------------|------|
| **Mature** | Production-proven, widely used | Low |
| **Established** | Production-ready, growing adoption | Low-Medium |
| **Emerging** | Early adoption, limited production use | Medium |
| **Experimental** | Pre-production, research phase | High |
| **Theoretical** | Conceptual, not yet implemented | Very High |

**For each core technology, assess:**
- Current maturity level
- Community and vendor support
- Documentation quality
- Talent availability in market
- Long-term viability

#### Technical Complexity Assessment

**Complexity Factors:**

| Factor | Low | Medium | High |
|--------|-----|--------|------|
| Integration points | 1-3 | 4-7 | 8+ |
| Data sources | 1-2 | 3-5 | 6+ |
| Custom algorithms | None | Some | Significant |
| Real-time requirements | None | Partial | Critical |
| Scale requirements | <1K users | 1K-100K | >100K |
| Security requirements | Basic | Standard | Stringent |
| Compliance requirements | None | Industry | Regulatory |

**Complexity Score:** Sum factors and categorize:
- 0-7: Low complexity (straightforward implementation)
- 8-14: Medium complexity (manageable with expertise)
- 15-21: High complexity (significant challenges expected)
- 22+: Very high complexity (consider scope reduction)

#### Technical Risk Factors

**Identify and rate (1-5) these risks:**

- **Unproven architecture:** Novel patterns without precedent
- **Integration complexity:** Many external system dependencies
- **Performance uncertainty:** Unclear if requirements are achievable
- **Scalability concerns:** Uncertainty about growth handling
- **Security challenges:** Complex threat model or compliance needs
- **Data complexity:** Large, unstructured, or sensitive data
- **Algorithm novelty:** Custom ML/AI or complex logic required

**Risk Mitigation Questions:**
- Have similar systems been built successfully?
- Are there proven patterns we can follow?
- Can we prototype high-risk components early?
- What are fallback options if primary approach fails?

### 2. Resource Feasibility

Evaluate whether required resources (people, time, money) are available.

#### Team Capability Assessment

**Required Skills Inventory:**

| Skill Area | Required Level | Current Level | Gap |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-----|
| Frontend development | | | |
| Backend development | | | |
| DevOps/Infrastructure | | | |
| Database/Data engineering | | | |
| Security | | | |
| Domain expertise | | | |
| Project management | | | |

**Levels:** None, Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert

**Gap Analysis:**
- Critical gaps (show-stoppers)
- Important gaps (require hiring/training)
- Minor gaps (manageable with learning)

#### Timeline Feasibility

**Timeline Estimation Factors:**

| Factor | Multiplier |
|--------|------------|
| Clear requirements | 1.0x |
| Partially defined requirements | 1.3x |

| Team learning new technologies | 1.3x |
| Team new to domain | 1.5x |
| Greenfield project | 1.0x |
| Legacy integration | 1.3x |
| Legacy replacement | 1.5x |

**Timeline Reality Check:**
- Apply multipliers to initial estimates
- Add 20-30% buffer for unknowns
- Compare to similar past projects
- Identify hard deadlines and assess achievability

#### Budget Feasibility

**Cost Categories to Estimate:**

```yaml
cost_categories:
  development:
    - Personnel (internal team)
    - Contractors/consultants
    - Training and upskilling
  infrastructure:
    - Cloud services (compute, storage, networking)
    - Development environments
    - CI/CD tooling
  third_party:
    - SaaS subscriptions
    - API costs
    - Licensing fees
  operational:
    - Monitoring and observability
    - Support tooling
    - Security tools
  contingency:
    - Risk buffer (15-25%)
    - Scope buffer (10-20%)
```

**Budget Viability Assessment:**
- Total estimated cost vs. available budget
- Cash flow timing requirements
- Hidden costs identification
- Cost overrun scenarios

### 3. Market Feasibility

Evaluate whether the project addresses a real market need.

#### Market Need Assessment

**Key Questions:**
- Is there demonstrated demand for this solution?
- What problem does it solve, and how painful is that problem?
- Who are the target users, and can we reach them?
- What is the market size (TAM, SAM, SOM)?
- Is the market growing, stable, or declining?

#### Competitive Landscape Analysis

**Competitor Assessment Matrix:**

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Differentiation |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| | | | |

**Competitive Position Questions:**
- Who are the main competitors?
- What is our unique value proposition?
- Can we compete on features, price, or experience?
- Are there barriers to entry?
- Is there room for another player?

#### Market Timing Assessment

| Timing | Description | Implication |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Too early** | Market not ready, user education needed | High risk, long runway required |
| **Early** | Market emerging, first-mover advantage possible | Medium risk, faster execution helps |
| **Right time** | Market established, clear demand | Lower risk, differentiation critical |
