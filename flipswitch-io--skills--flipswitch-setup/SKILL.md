name: flipswitch-setup
description: Sets up the Flipswitch feature flag SDK in a project. Detects the project language, installs the SDK, writes initialization code, and creates an example flag. Use when starting with Flipswitch, integrating feature flags for the first time, or when the user asks to set up or install Flipswitch.

Set up the Flipswitch feature flag SDK in this project.

## IMPORTANT: Execute these steps directly

Do NOT create helper tasks, spawn subagents, or delegate work. Execute each step in sequence, calling the MCP tools directly and handling results inline.

## Progress

Copy this checklist and check off items as you complete them:

```
Setup Progress:
- [ ] Step 0: Verify MCP server connectivity
- [ ] Step 1: Authenticate with Flipswitch
- [ ] Step 2: Detect project language
- [ ] Step 3: Select organization and project
- [ ] Step 4: Select environment
- [ ] Step 5: Get SDK API key
- [ ] Step 6: Get SDK setup snippet
- [ ] Step 7: Install SDK
- [ ] Step 8: Write initialization code
- [ ] Step 9: Example flag integration (optional)
```

## Step 0: Verify MCP Server Configuration

**Call `mcp__flipswitch__authenticate` immediately to test connectivity.**

- If it succeeds (returns auth status or URL+code): ✅ MCP server is configured. Proceed to Step 1.
- If it fails with "tool not found" or "unknown tool": ❌ MCP server is NOT configured. Tell the user they need to add the Flipswitch MCP server with URL `https://mcp.flipswitch.io/mcp` to their tool's MCP configuration, then restart and retry. Refer them to the [Flipswitch Skills README](https://github.com/flipswitch-io/skills#step-2-configure-the-mcp-server) for tool-specific instructions.
  Stop here. User must configure and retry.
- If it fails with a network error: ⚠️ MCP server is configured but unreachable. Ask user to check internet connection.

## Step 1: Check Authentication Status

After successful `mcp__flipswitch__authenticate` call, check the result:

- **Already authenticated**: Display the auth status and proceed to Step 2.
- **Device code provided**: Show the user the URL and device code. Tell them to visit the URL, enter the code, and authorize. **Then immediately call `mcp__flipswitch__authenticate` again** to confirm.

## Step 2: Detect Project Language

Use Glob to find language markers in the project root:
- Check for `package.json` or `tsconfig.json` → **javascript**
- Check for `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `Pipfile` → **python**
- Check for `go.mod` → **go**
- Check for `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, or `build.gradle.kts` → **java**

If you find files for multiple languages or none, ask the user to specify using `AskUserQuestion` with options: "JavaScript", "Python", "Go", "Java", "Other".

**For JavaScript projects only**: Also determine if it's a web or server (Node.js) project:
- If `next.config.js`, `vite.config.js`, `webpack.config.js`, or similar build config exists → **web**
- If it's a Next.js/Remix/similar full-stack framework → ask the user if they want snippets for web, server, or both
- If `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` exists and no obvious web build config → likely **server**
- If uncertain, ask the user: "Is this a web app (browser), Node.js server, or full-stack?". Use `AskUserQuestion` with options: "Web browser", "Node.js server", "Both (I'll use both snippets)"

Save the selected language and JS environment (if applicable).

## Step 3: Get Organizations and Projects

**Call `mcp__flipswitch__list_organizations` with no arguments.**

- If only 1 org: Use it automatically.
- If multiple orgs: Use `AskUserQuestion` to let user pick one.

Save the selected org ID.

**Then call `mcp__flipswitch__list_projects` with `organizationId` set to the saved org ID.**

- If only 1 project: Use it automatically.
- If multiple projects: Use `AskUserQuestion` to let user pick one.

Save the selected project ID.

## Step 4: Get Environments

**Call `mcp__flipswitch__list_environments` with `organizationId` and `projectId` set to saved values.**

- If an environment named "Development" exists: Use it automatically.
- Otherwise: Use `AskUserQuestion` to let user pick an environment.

Save the selected environment ID.

## Step 5: Get SDK API Key

**Call `mcp__flipswitch__get_sdk_api_key` with `organizationId`, `projectId`, and `environmentId` set to saved values.**

Save the returned API key for the next step.

## Step 6: Get SDK Setup Snippet

**Call `mcp__flipswitch__get_sdk_setup_snippet` with:**
- `language`: saved language from Step 2
- `apiKey`: saved API key from Step 5
- If language is javascript: also set `jsEnvironment` based on detection from Step 2 (e.g., "web" or "server")

Display the returned install command and init code to the user.

## Step 7: Install SDK

**Use the Bash tool to run the install command returned from Step 6:**
- **javascript (web)**: `npm install @flipswitch-io/sdk @openfeature/web-sdk`
- **javascript (server)**: `npm install @flipswitch-io/sdk @openfeature/js-sdk`
- **python**: `pip install flipswitch-sdk`
- **go**: `go get github.com/flipswitch-io/go-sdk`
- **java**: For Maven/Gradle projects, use the Write tool to add the dependency to `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` instead

If the install command fails, show the error and ask the user how to proceed.

## Step 8: Write Initialization Code

Get the init code from Step 6's result. Based on the language, create a file:
- **javascript**: `src/flipswitch.ts` (or `.js` if not TypeScript)
- **python**: `flipswitch.py`
- **go**: `flipswitch.go`
- **java**: `Flipswitch.java`

**Use the Write tool to create the file with the init code from Step 6.**

Display the file path to the user.

## Step 9: Example Flag Integration (Optional)

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "Would you like to add a feature flag example to your codebase?" with these options:

1. **Create a new flag** — "Create a new feature flag and generate example code"
2. **Use an existing flag** — "Pick one of your existing flags and generate example code"
3. **Skip for now** — "I'll add flags later"

### Option A: Create a new flag

Ask the user for a flag name (e.g. "Dark Mode"). Then:
- Use the name as the human-readable **name**
- Convert to kebab-case for the **key**
- Call `mcp__flipswitch__create_flag` with the org ID, project ID, generated key, name, and `flagValueType`: `Boolean`
- If it fails with "key already exists": inform the user and suggest they pick "Use an existing flag" instead
- If it fails for another reason: report the error but continue
- Save the flag key and proceed to the code generation step below

### Option B: Use an existing flag

Call `mcp__flipswitch__list_flags` with the org and project IDs.
- If no flags exist: tell the user and loop back to offer "Create a new flag" or "Skip for now"
- If flags exist: use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user pick one, also if only one flag exists
- Save the selected flag's key and proceed to the code generation step below

### Option C: Skip for now

Skip to Step 10.

### Generate example code

Once a flag is selected (Option A or B), generate a real usage example:

1. **Scan the codebase** for a suitable integration point. Use Glob and Grep to look for patterns like:
   - Route handlers, API endpoints, or controller methods
   - UI component render functions
   - Configuration or feature logic
   - Middleware or request processing
2. **If a good candidate is found**: show the user the file and the specific location, then write code that wraps the existing logic in a flag evaluation using the selected flag key. Import the Flipswitch init from the file created in Step 8.
3. **If no suitable candidate is found** (e.g. empty or unfamiliar project): call `mcp__flipswitch__get_sdk_setup_snippet` with the `flagKey` set to the selected flag key to get evaluation code, and show it to the user as a standalone example they can paste into their code.

## Step 10: Summary

Show the user:
- ✅ SDK installed
- ✅ Initialization code written to `<file_path>`
- If a flag was integrated: ✅ Flag `{key}` integrated with example code
- If skipped: ℹ️ No flag configured yet — create one with `/flipswitch-create`
- Link: https://app.flipswitch.io
- Next steps: Enable the flag with `/flipswitch-toggle` or in the dashboard
