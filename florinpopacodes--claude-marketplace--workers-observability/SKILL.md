# Cloudflare Workers Observability

Debug and monitor Cloudflare Workers using logs and analytics from the Observability MCP server.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `query_worker_observability` | Query logs and metrics from Workers |
| `observability_keys` | Discover available data fields in logs |
| `observability_values` | Find available values for specific fields |

## Query Workflow

### 1. Discover Available Fields
Use `observability_keys` to find what data is available:
- Metadata fields (timestamps, status codes)
- Worker-specific fields (script name, route)
- Custom logged fields from console.log

### 2. Explore Field Values
Use `observability_values` to find valid values for filtering:
- Status codes present in logs
- Script names deployed
- Custom field values

### 3. Query Logs and Metrics
Use `query_worker_observability` to:
- List recent events/invocations
- Calculate metrics (error rates, latency)
- Find specific invocations by criteria

## Common Queries

| Goal | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Recent errors | Query for events with error status |
| Latency analysis | Query for execution time metrics |
| Traffic patterns | Query for invocation counts over time |
| Specific request | Query by request ID or timestamp |
| Script comparison | Query metrics grouped by script name |

## Debugging Workflow

1. **Identify the problem**
   - Query recent errors with `query_worker_observability`

2. **Find patterns**
   - Use `observability_keys` to discover relevant fields
   - Use `observability_values` to see error types

3. **Narrow down**
   - Add filters for specific routes, times, or status codes

4. **Analyze specific invocations**
   - Query for detailed logs of problematic requests

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

After deploying, check for issues:
1. Query for errors in the last 5-10 minutes
2. Compare error rates before/after deployment
3. Check latency metrics for performance regression

## Tips

- Start broad, then add filters to narrow results
- Use `observability_keys` when unsure what fields exist
- Custom console.log output appears in queryable fields
- Combine with builds tools to correlate issues with deployments
