# E2E Testing with Playwright

This skill guides running E2E tests and updating visual regression snapshots for the portfolio. All visual regression tests **must run in Docker** to ensure consistent screenshots across environments.

## Critical Rule

**NEVER run `--update-snapshots` outside Docker.** Screenshots generated locally will differ from CI due to font rendering, anti-aliasing, and platform differences. Always use the Docker commands.

## Quick Reference

| Task                           | Command                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Run all tests (local)          | `npm run test:e2e`                              |
| Run tests in Docker            | `npm run test:e2e:docker`                       |
| Update snapshots (Docker only) | `npm run test:e2e:docker:update`                |
| Run specific browser           | `npm run test:e2e:docker -- --project=chromium` |
| Run specific test              | `npm run test:e2e:docker -- -g "test name"`     |
| Open test UI                   | `npm run test:e2e:ui`                           |

## Workflow: After Modifying a Feature

When changes affect the UI, follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Run Tests to See Failures

```bash
fnm use && npm run test:e2e:docker
```

Review which visual regression tests fail. The test output shows pixel differences.

### Step 2: Update Snapshots in Docker

```bash
fnm use && npm run test:e2e:docker:update
```

This regenerates all snapshots using the Docker container, ensuring consistency with CI.

### Step 3: Verify Tests Pass

```bash
fnm use && npm run test:e2e:docker
```

All tests should now pass.

### Step 4: Review Changes

```bash
git diff test/e2e.test.ts-snapshots/
```

Visually inspect the updated screenshots to confirm they look correct.

## Workflow: Adding New E2E Tests

### Step 1: Write the Test

Add tests to `test/e2e.test.ts`. Follow existing patterns:

```typescript
test("new feature test", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/");
  await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");

  // Navigate to the feature
  // ...

  // For visual regression, use toHaveScreenshot
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot("06-new-feature.png", {
    fullPage: true,
  });
});
```

### Step 2: Generate Initial Snapshots

```bash
fnm use && npm run test:e2e:docker:update
```

New snapshots are created in `test/e2e.test.ts-snapshots/` with browser-specific suffixes.

### Step 3: Verify and Commit

Review the generated screenshots, then commit both the test and snapshots.

## Test Structure

The test file is organized into two describe blocks:

1. **Portfolio E2E Tests** - Functional tests (page loads, elements visible)
2. **Visual Regression Tests** - Screenshot comparisons

### Browser Coverage

Tests run on three browsers (configured in `playwright.config.ts`):

- Chromium (Chrome)
- Firefox
- WebKit (Safari)

Snapshots are generated per-browser with suffixes like:

- `01-welcome-screen-chromium-darwin.png`
- `01-welcome-screen-firefox-darwin.png`
- `01-welcome-screen-webkit-darwin.png`

## Docker Configuration

The Docker setup in `scripts/playwright-docker.sh`:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION="v1.58.1"
IMAGE="mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:${PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION}-noble"
```

**Keep this version in sync with:**

- `package.json` → `@playwright/test` version
- `.github/workflows/pr.yml` → container image version

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail with Pixel Differences

Small pixel differences (< 1%) may occur due to timing. Solutions:

1. Add `await page.waitForTimeout(300)` before screenshot
2. Use `reducedMotion: "reduce"` (already configured)
3. Ensure animations complete before capturing

### Docker Command Fails

Ensure Docker is running:

```bash
docker info
```

### Snapshots Don't Match CI

This happens when snapshots were generated outside Docker. Fix:

```bash
fnm use && npm run test:e2e:docker:update
```

### Test Timeout

Increase timeout for slow operations:

```typescript
await expect(element).toBeVisible({ timeout: 15000 });
```

## Checklist

When updating visual regression tests:

- [ ] Ran tests in Docker (`npm run test:e2e:docker`)
- [ ] Updated snapshots in Docker (`npm run test:e2e:docker:update`)
- [ ] Verified all tests pass (`npm run test:e2e:docker`)
- [ ] Reviewed screenshot changes visually
- [ ] Committed both test changes and updated snapshots
