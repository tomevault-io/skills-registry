# Update Portfolio Content

This skill guides updating personal/professional content across the portfolio. All content lives in centralized config files—React components only read from these configs.

## Architecture Principle

**Components never hold personal information.** All content must be in config files:

- `src/config/profile.ts` - Single source of truth for all personal data
- `src/config/dialogTrees.ts` - Interactive chat dialogue content

## Update Workflow

### Step 1: Update Profile Config

Edit `src/config/profile.ts` with the new information. This file contains:

```typescript
PROFILE = {
  name, // Full name
  title, // Professional title
  location, // Current location
  email, // Contact email
  social, // { github, linkedin }
  portfolio, // { version, title }
  bio, // About section text
  skills, // { frontend, backend, ai, cloud, data, testing, leadership }
  experienceSummary, // Work experience summary
  projects, // Array of { emoji, name, description, tech }
  contactInterests, // Array of discussion topics
  resumeUrl, // Path to resume PDF
};
```

### Step 2: Update Dialogue Trees

Edit `src/config/dialogTrees.ts` to reflect the updated information. Key nodes to update:

| Node               | Content to Update                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `intro`            | First impression, name, location                |
| `about-intro`      | Background story, years of experience, location |
| `about-details`    | Career journey, tech stack, current focus       |
| `about-philosophy` | Development philosophy                          |
| `work-intro`       | Current role, company, what you build           |
| `work-stack`       | Tech stack details, achievements                |
| `work-experience`  | Company history summary                         |
| `hire-contact`     | Email, contact methods                          |
| `hire-remote`      | Location, remote work preferences               |

### Step 3: Verify No Hardcoded Content

Check that `src/components/game/ContentModal.tsx` only reads from `PROFILE`:

- Projects section uses `PROFILE.projects`
- Contact section uses `PROFILE.contactInterests`
- All other sections reference `PROFILE` properties

### Step 4: Format and Lint

```bash
fnm use && npm run format
```

## Dialogue Tone Guidelines

The portfolio has a retro game theme (Day of the Tentacle / Monkey Island inspired). Dialogue should be:

- **Playful and witty** - Include humor and game references
- **Accurate** - All facts must match the resume/profile data
- **Conversational** - Like talking to a friend, not reading a resume

### Example Dialogue Style

```typescript
// Good - playful with accurate info
"Plot twist: I started with a Master's in Psychology! 10 years later,
here I am in Zürich, building AI-powered security tools at Snyk."

// Bad - too formal
"I am a Senior Software Engineer with 10 years of experience
currently employed at Snyk in Zürich, Switzerland."
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Updated relevant nodes in `src/config/dialogTrees.ts`
- [ ] Verified `ContentModal.tsx` has no hardcoded personal content
