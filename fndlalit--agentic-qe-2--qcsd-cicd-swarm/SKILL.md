# QCSD CI/CD Swarm v1.0

Shift-left quality engineering swarm for CI/CD pipeline verification and release readiness.

---

## Overview

The CI/CD Swarm takes code that passed Development quality checks and validates it is
safe to release through the CI/CD pipeline. Where the Development Swarm asks "Is the
code quality sufficient to ship?", the CI/CD Swarm asks "Is this change safe to release?"

This swarm operates at the pipeline level, analyzing test results, regression risk,
flaky test impact, security pipeline status, and infrastructure changes to render
a RELEASE / REMEDIATE / BLOCK decision.

### QCSD Phase Positioning

| Phase | Swarm | Question | Decision | When |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|------|
| Ideation | qcsd-ideation-swarm | Should we build this? | GO / CONDITIONAL / NO-GO | PI/Sprint Planning |
| Refinement | qcsd-refinement-swarm | How should we test this? | READY / CONDITIONAL / NOT-READY | Sprint Refinement |
| Development | qcsd-development-swarm | Is the code quality sufficient? | SHIP / CONDITIONAL / HOLD | During Sprint |
| **Verification** | **qcsd-cicd-swarm** | **Is this change safe to release?** | **RELEASE / REMEDIATE / BLOCK** | **Pre-Release / CI-CD** |

### Key Differentiators from Development Swarm

| Dimension | Development Swarm | CI/CD Swarm |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Framework | TDD + Complexity + Coverage | Quality Gates + Regression + Stability |
| Agents | 7 (3 core + 3 conditional + 1 analysis) | 7 (3 core + 3 conditional + 1 analysis) |
| Core Output | Code quality assessment | Release readiness assessment |
| Decision | SHIP / CONDITIONAL / HOLD | RELEASE / REMEDIATE / BLOCK |
| Flags | HAS_SECURITY_CODE, HAS_PERFORMANCE_CODE, HAS_CRITICAL_CODE | HAS_SECURITY_PIPELINE, HAS_PERFORMANCE_PIPELINE, HAS_INFRA_CHANGE |
| Phase | During Sprint Development | Pre-Release / CI-CD Pipeline |
| Input | Source code + test files | Pipeline artifacts + test results + build output |
| Final Step | Defect prediction analysis | Deployment readiness advisory |

---

### Parameters

- `PIPELINE_ARTIFACTS`: Path to CI/CD artifacts, test results, and build output (required, e.g., `ci/artifacts/`)
- `BASELINE_REF`: Git ref for baseline comparison (optional, default: `main`)
- `OUTPUT_FOLDER`: Where to save reports (default: `${PROJECT_ROOT}/Agentic QCSD/cicd/`)
- `DEPLOY_TARGET`: Target deployment environment (optional, e.g., `staging`, `production`)

## ENFORCEMENT RULES - READ FIRST

**These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Violation means skill execution failure.**

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| **E1** | You MUST spawn ALL THREE core agents (qe-quality-gate, qe-regression-analyzer, qe-flaky-hunter) in Phase 2. No exceptions. |
| **E2** | You MUST put all parallel Task calls in a SINGLE message. |
| **E3** | You MUST STOP and WAIT after each batch. No proceeding early. |
| **E4** | You MUST spawn conditional agents if flags are TRUE. No skipping. |
| **E5** | You MUST apply RELEASE/REMEDIATE/BLOCK logic exactly as specified in Phase 5. |
| **E6** | You MUST generate the full report structure. No abbreviated versions. |
| **E7** | Each agent MUST read its reference files before analysis. |
| **E8** | You MUST apply qe-deployment-advisor analysis on ALL pipeline data in Phase 8. Always. |
| **E9** | You MUST execute Phase 7 learning persistence. Store verification findings to memory BEFORE Phase 8. No skipping. |

**PROHIBITED BEHAVIORS:**
- Summarizing instead of spawning agents
- Skipping agents "for brevity"
- Proceeding before background tasks complete
- Providing your own analysis instead of spawning specialists
- Omitting report sections
- Using placeholder text like "[details here]"
- Skipping the deployment readiness analysis
- Skipping learning persistence (Phase 7) or treating it as optional
- Generating pipeline analysis yourself instead of using specialist agents

---

## PHASE 1: Analyze Pipeline Context (Flag Detection)

**MANDATORY: You must complete this analysis before Phase 2.**

Scan the pipeline artifacts, CI/CD configuration, test results, and change diff to SET these flags. Do not skip any flag.

### Flag Detection (Check ALL THREE)

```
HAS_SECURITY_PIPELINE = FALSE
  Set TRUE if pipeline contains ANY of: security scan results, SAST output,
  DAST output, dependency audit results, CVE reports, container scan,
  secrets detection output, compliance check results, SBOM generation,
  penetration test results, security gate failures, auth-related changes,
  certificate changes, encryption changes, API key rotation

HAS_PERFORMANCE_PIPELINE = FALSE
  Set TRUE if pipeline contains ANY of: load test results, performance
  benchmark output, latency metrics, throughput data, stress test results,
  memory profiling output, CPU profiling data, response time baselines,
  scalability test results, database query performance, cache hit ratios,
  CDN performance data, API response times, SLA compliance metrics

HAS_INFRA_CHANGE = FALSE
  Set TRUE if changes include ANY of: Dockerfile, docker-compose,
  kubernetes manifests, terraform files, CloudFormation templates,
  CI/CD pipeline config (.github/workflows, .gitlab-ci, Jenkinsfile),
  infrastructure as code, helm charts, ansible playbooks,
  environment variables, nginx config, database migrations,
  service mesh config, load balancer config, DNS changes
```

### Validation Checkpoint

Before proceeding to Phase 2, confirm:

```
+-- I have read the pipeline artifacts and test results
+-- I have read the CI/CD configuration files
+-- I have reviewed the change diff against baseline
+-- I have evaluated ALL THREE flags
+-- I have recorded which flags are TRUE
+-- I understand which conditional agents will be needed
```

**DO NOT proceed to Phase 2 until all checkboxes are confirmed.**

### MANDATORY: Output Flag Detection Results

You MUST output flag detection results before proceeding:

```

|                                                             |
|  EXPECTED AGENTS:                                           |
|  - Core: 3 (always)                                         |
|  - Conditional: [count based on TRUE flags]                 |
|  - Analysis: 1 (always)                                     |
|  - TOTAL: [3 + conditional count + 1]                       |
|                                                             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**DO NOT proceed to Phase 2 without outputting flag detection results.**

- Test fails inconsistently across runs
- Test depends on execution order
- Test has timing-sensitive assertions
- Test depends on external state
- Test uses non-deterministic data
- Test has race conditions

| External Dependencies | X | [test list] | [mock/stub] |
| Shared State | X | [test list] | [isolation] |
| Environment Sensitivity | X | [test list] | [env fix] |
| Data Dependencies | X | [test list] | [data setup] |
| Ordering Dependencies | X | [test list] | [independence] |

## PHASE 4: Spawn Conditional Agents (PARALLEL BATCH 2)

### ENFORCEMENT: NO SKIPPING CONDITIONAL AGENTS

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  IF A FLAG IS TRUE, YOU MUST SPAWN THAT AGENT                |
|                                                              |
|  HAS_SECURITY_PIPELINE = TRUE    -> MUST spawn qe-security-scanner   |
|  HAS_PERFORMANCE_PIPELINE = TRUE -> MUST spawn qe-chaos-engineer     |
|  HAS_INFRA_CHANGE = TRUE         -> MUST spawn qe-coverage-specialist|
|                                                              |
|  Skipping a flagged agent is a FAILURE of this skill.        |

                              - Infrastructure change coverage, config drift, artifact verification

  WAITING for conditional agents to complete...
```

## PHASE 5: Synthesize Results & Determine Recommendation

### ENFORCEMENT: EXACT DECISION LOGIC

**You MUST apply this logic EXACTLY. No interpretation.**

```
STEP 1: Derive composite metrics
-----------------------------------------------------------
qualityGatesPassed = (qualityGateStatus == "PASSED")
testPassRate = testPassRate from qe-quality-gate
regressionRisk = regressionRisk from qe-regression-analyzer (0-50 scale)
flakyRate = flakyRate from qe-flaky-hunter
criticalFlaky = criticalFlaky from qe-flaky-hunter
failedTests = failedTests from qe-quality-gate
securityFindings = (critical + high severity findings from security, if ran)
performanceRegressions = (count of regressions from chaos engineer, if ran)

STEP 2: Check BLOCK conditions (ANY triggers BLOCK)
-----------------------------------------------------------
IF qualityGatesPassed == FALSE        -> BLOCK ("Quality gates failed")
IF testPassRate < 95                  -> BLOCK ("Test pass rate critically low")
IF failedTests > 0 AND critical       -> BLOCK ("Critical test failures")
IF regressionRisk > 40               -> BLOCK ("Regression risk too high")
IF securityFindings > 0 (critical)    -> BLOCK ("Critical security vulnerabilities")

STEP 3: Check RELEASE conditions (ALL required for RELEASE)
-----------------------------------------------------------
IF qualityGatesPassed == TRUE
   AND testPassRate >= 99
   AND regressionRisk <= 15
   AND flakyRate <= 2
   AND criticalFlaky == 0
   AND failedTests == 0
   AND securityFindings == 0          -> RELEASE

STEP 4: Default
-----------------------------------------------------------
ELSE                                  -> REMEDIATE
```

### Decision Recording

```
METRICS:
- qualityGatesPassed = TRUE/FALSE
- testPassRate = __%
- regressionRisk = __/50
- flakyRate = __%
- criticalFlaky = __
- failedTests = __
- securityFindings = __ (if applicable)
- performanceRegressions = __ (if applicable)

BLOCK CHECK:
- qualityGatesPassed == FALSE? __ (YES/NO)
- testPassRate < 95? __ (YES/NO)
- critical test failures? __ (YES/NO)
- regressionRisk > 40? __ (YES/NO)
- critical security findings? __ (YES/NO)

RELEASE CHECK (only if no BLOCK triggered):
- qualityGatesPassed == TRUE? __ (YES/NO)
- testPassRate >= 99? __ (YES/NO)
- regressionRisk <= 15? __ (YES/NO)
- flakyRate <= 2? __ (YES/NO)
- criticalFlaky == 0? __ (YES/NO)
- failedTests == 0? __ (YES/NO)
- securityFindings == 0? __ (YES/NO)

FINAL RECOMMENDATION: [RELEASE / REMEDIATE / BLOCK]
REASON: ___
```

### Remediate Recommendations

If recommendation is REMEDIATE, provide specific remediation steps:

| Issue | Current Value | Required Value | Owner | Action |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-------|--------|
| ... | ... | ... | [who] | [what to do] |

If recommendation is BLOCK, provide mandatory fixes:

| Fix | Priority | Effort | Must Complete Before |
|-----|----------|--------|---------------------|
| ... | P0 | [scope] | [release can proceed] |

## PHASE 7: Store Learnings & Persist State

### ENFORCEMENT: ALWAYS RUN THIS PHASE

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  LEARNING PERSISTENCE MUST ALWAYS EXECUTE                    |
|                                                              |
|  This is NOT optional. It runs on EVERY verification scan.   |
|  It stores findings for cross-phase feedback loops,          |
|  historical pipeline quality tracking, and pattern learning. |
|                                                              |
|  DO NOT skip this phase for any reason.                      |
|  DO NOT treat this as "nice to have".                        |
|  Enforcement Rule E9 applies.                                |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Purpose

Store verification findings for:
- Cross-phase feedback loops (Verification -> next Ideation cycle)
- Historical pipeline stability tracking across releases
- Regression risk trend analysis over time
- Pattern learning for flaky test prediction improvement

### Auto-Execution Steps (ALL THREE are MANDATORY)

**Step 1: Store verification findings to memory**

You MUST execute this MCP call with actual values from the verification analysis:

```javascript
mcp__agentic-qe__memory_store({
  key: `qcsd-cicd-${releaseId}-${Date.now()}`,
  namespace: "qcsd-cicd",
  value: {
    releaseId: releaseId,
    releaseName: releaseName,
    recommendation: recommendation,  // RELEASE, REMEDIATE, BLOCK
    metrics: {
      qualityGatesPassed: qualityGatesPassed,
      testPassRate: testPassRate,
      regressionRisk: regressionRisk,
      flakyRate: flakyRate,
      criticalFlaky: criticalFlaky,
      failedTests: failedTests,
      pipelineStability: stabilityScore,
      securityFindings: securityFindings,  // if applicable
      performanceRegressions: performanceRegressions  // if applicable
    },
    flags: {
      HAS_SECURITY_PIPELINE: HAS_SECURITY_PIPELINE,
      HAS_PERFORMANCE_PIPELINE: HAS_PERFORMANCE_PIPELINE,
      HAS_INFRA_CHANGE: HAS_INFRA_CHANGE
    },
    agentsInvoked: agentList,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }
})
```

**Step 2: Share learnings with learning coordinator**

You MUST execute this MCP call to propagate patterns cross-domain:

```javascript
mcp__agentic-qe__memory_share({
  sourceAgentId: "qcsd-cicd-swarm",
  targetAgentIds: ["qe-learning-coordinator", "qe-pattern-learner"],
  knowledgeDomain: "cicd-verification-patterns"
})
```

**Step 3: Save learning persistence record to output folder**

You MUST use the Write tool to save a JSON record of the persisted learnings:

```
Save to: ${OUTPUT_FOLDER}/09-learning-persistence.json

Contents:
{
  "phase": "QCSD-Verification",
  "releaseId": "[release ID]",
  "releaseName": "[release name]",
  "recommendation": "[RELEASE/REMEDIATE/BLOCK]",
  "memoryKey": "qcsd-cicd-[releaseId]-[timestamp]",
  "namespace": "qcsd-cicd",
  "metrics": {
    "qualityGatesPassed": true/false,
    "testPassRate": [0-100],
    "regressionRisk": [0-50],
    "flakyRate": [0-100],
    "criticalFlaky": [N],
    "failedTests": [N],
    "pipelineStability": [0-100],
    "securityFindings": [N or null],
    "performanceRegressions": [N or null]
  },
  "flags": {
    "HAS_SECURITY_PIPELINE": true/false,
    "HAS_PERFORMANCE_PIPELINE": true/false,
    "HAS_INFRA_CHANGE": true/false
  },
  "agentsInvoked": ["list", "of", "agents"],
  "crossPhaseSignals": {
    "toProduction": "Release readiness metrics as production monitoring baseline",
    "toIdeation": "Pipeline patterns for future risk assessment"
  },
  "persistedAt": "[ISO timestamp]"
}
```

### Fallback: CLI Memory Commands

If MCP memory_store tool is unavailable, use CLI instead (STILL MANDATORY):

```bash
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest memory store \
  --key "qcsd-cicd-${RELEASE_ID}-$(date +%s)" \
  --value '{"recommendation":"[VALUE]","testPassRate":[N],"regressionRisk":[N],"flakyRate":[N]}' \
  --namespace qcsd-cicd

npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks post-task \
  --task-id "qcsd-cicd-${RELEASE_ID}" \
  --success true
```

### Validation Before Proceeding to Phase 8

```
+-- Did I execute mcp__agentic-qe__memory_store with actual values? (not placeholders)
+-- Did I execute mcp__agentic-qe__memory_share to propagate learnings?
+-- Did I save 09-learning-persistence.json to the output folder?
+-- Does the JSON contain the correct recommendation from Phase 5?
+-- Does the JSON contain actual metrics from Phases 2-4?
+-- Does the JSON contain actual flag values from Phase 1?
```

**If ANY validation check fails, DO NOT proceed to Phase 8.**

### Cross-Phase Signal Consumption

The CI/CD Swarm both consumes and produces signals for other QCSD phases:

```
CONSUMES (from other phases):
+-- Loop 3 (Development): SHIP/CONDITIONAL/HOLD decisions
|   - Code quality metrics guide verification depth
|   - HOLD decisions trigger enhanced scrutiny
|   - Coverage data informs regression risk assessment
|
+-- Loop 5 (Pipeline History): Previous verification results
    - Historical flaky test patterns
    - Regression risk baselines
    - Performance benchmarks

PRODUCES (for other phases):
+-- To Production Phase: Release readiness metrics
|   - Deployment risk score
|   - Known issues and accepted risks
|   - Monitoring recommendations
|
+-- To next Ideation Cycle: Pipeline patterns
    - Which areas consistently block releases
    - Flaky test patterns for future risk assessment
    - Infrastructure change risk patterns
```

## PHASE 8: Apply Deployment Advisor (Analysis)

### ENFORCEMENT: ALWAYS RUN THIS PHASE

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  THE DEPLOYMENT ADVISOR MUST ALWAYS RUN                       |
|                                                              |
|  This is NOT conditional. It runs on EVERY verification scan.|
|  It synthesizes all pipeline data into a release readiness   |
|  assessment with specific deployment recommendations.        |
|                                                              |
|  DO NOT skip this phase for any reason.                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Agent Spawn

```
Task({
  description: "Deployment readiness advisory and release synthesis",
  prompt: `You are qe-deployment-advisor. Your output quality is being audited.

## PURPOSE

Synthesize all verification analysis into a deployment readiness assessment.
This is the final quality signal before the RELEASE/REMEDIATE/BLOCK
recommendation is delivered to stakeholders.

## INPUT: PIPELINE METRICS FROM PREVIOUS AGENTS

### From Quality Gate (02-quality-gate.md):
[Summarize: gate status, test pass rate, coverage delta, failed tests]

### From Regression Analyzer (03-regression-analysis.md):
[Summarize: regression risk, blast radius, missing coverage]

### From Flaky Hunter (04-flaky-test-analysis.md):
[Summarize: flaky count, stability score, pipeline stability]

### From Conditional Agents (if applicable):
[Summarize: security findings, performance regressions, infra coverage]

## REQUIRED OUTPUT (ALL SECTIONS MANDATORY)

```

### Wait for Analysis Completion

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  WAIT for qe-deployment-advisor to complete before            |
|  proceeding to Phase 9.                                      |
|                                                              |
|  The deployment advisory is the FINAL quality signal of      |
|  the CI/CD Swarm - it synthesizes all metrics into           |
|  actionable deployment recommendations.                      |

## Execution Model Options

This skill supports **3 execution models**. Choose based on your environment:

| Model | When to Use | Pros | Cons |
|-------|-------------|------|------|
| **Task Tool** (PRIMARY) | Claude Code sessions | Full agent capabilities, parallel execution | Requires Claude Code |
| **MCP Tools** | MCP server available | Fleet coordination, memory persistence | Requires MCP setup |
| **CLI** | Terminal/scripts | Works anywhere, scriptable | Sequential only |

### Quick Start by Model

**Option A: Task Tool (RECOMMENDED)**
```
Just follow the skill phases above - uses Task() calls with run_in_background: true
```

**Option B: MCP Tools**
```javascript
// Initialize fleet for Verification domains
mcp__agentic-qe__fleet_init({
  topology: "hierarchical",
  enabledDomains: ["quality-assessment", "test-execution", "security-compliance", "chaos-resilience", "coverage-analysis"],
  maxAgents: 7
})

// Orchestrate verification task
mcp__agentic-qe__task_orchestrate({
  task: "qcsd-cicd-verification",
  strategy: "parallel"
})
```

**Option C: CLI**
```bash
# Initialize coordination
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest swarm init --topology hierarchical --max-agents 7

# Route task
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest hooks pre-task --description "QCSD Verification for [Release]"

# Execute agents
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest agent spawn --type qe-quality-gate
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest agent spawn --type qe-regression-analyzer
npx @claude-flow/cli@latest agent spawn --type qe-flaky-hunter
```

| 3 | WAIT for completion | Proceeding before results |
| 4 | Spawn ALL flagged conditional agents | Skipping a TRUE flag |
| 5 | Apply EXACT decision logic | Wrong recommendation |
| 6 | Generate COMPLETE report | Missing sections |
| 7 | ALWAYS store learnings + save 09-learning-persistence.json | Pattern loss, missing audit trail |
| 8 | ALWAYS run deployment advisor | Skipping analysis |
| 9 | Output completion summary | Missing final output |

## Inventory Summary

| Resource Type | Count | Primary | Conditional | Analysis |
|---------------|:-----:|:-------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
| **Agents** | 7 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| **Sub-agents** | 0 | - | - | - |
| **Skills** | 4 | 4 | - | - |
| **Domains** | 5 | 2 | 3 | 1 |
| **Parallel Batches** | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Skills Used:**
1. `shift-left-testing` - Pre-merge test strategy
2. `shift-right-testing` - Post-deploy monitoring patterns
3. `regression-testing` - Regression detection framework
4. `security-testing` - OWASP scanning patterns

**Frameworks Applied:**
1. Quality Gate Enforcement - Threshold-based pass/fail evaluation
2. Regression Risk Analysis - Change impact and blast radius calculation
3. Flaky Test Detection - Pattern-based stability assessment
4. SAST/DAST Pipeline Validation - Security gate verification
5. Performance Regression Detection - Baseline comparison analysis
6. Deployment Readiness Matrix - Multi-dimensional release assessment

---

## Key Principle

**Releases ship when pipelines are green, not when deadlines arrive.**

This swarm provides:
1. **Are quality gates passing?** -> Quality Gate Evaluation (8 dimensions)
2. **Will changes break existing features?** -> Regression Risk Analysis (5 factors)
3. **Is the pipeline stable?** -> Flaky Test Detection (6 root cause categories)
4. **Is the security pipeline clean?** -> Security Gate Validation (if security changes)
5. **Are performance baselines met?** -> Performance Regression Detection (if perf changes)
6. **Is infrastructure properly tested?** -> Infrastructure Coverage (if infra changes)
7. **Is it safe to deploy?** -> Deployment Readiness Advisory (always)
8. **Should we release?** -> RELEASE/REMEDIATE/BLOCK decision
9. **What did we learn?** -> Memory persistence for future cycles
