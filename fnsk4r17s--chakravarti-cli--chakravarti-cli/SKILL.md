# Chakravarti CLI

Command-line interface for Chakravarti

## Commands

### ckrv code

Code workflow commands — mirrors the Code page tabs in the Web UI.

Groups the full development pipeline under a single namespace:
- spec   — create and manage feature specifications
- tasks  — generate implementation tasks from a spec
- plan   — generate an execution plan from tasks
- run    — execute the plan with AI agents
- diff   — review changes before promoting

Use `ckrv code <subcommand> --help` for details on each step.

```bash
ckrv code
```

**Examples**:

# Create a new spec and generate tasks
ckrv code spec new "Add user authentication"
ckrv code tasks

# Plan and run
ckrv code plan
ckrv code run

# Review changes
ckrv code diff

#### ckrv code diff

View changes between current branch and base.

Shows a summary of modified, added, and deleted files compared to the base branch. Helps verify what will be included in a pull request.

Output can be formatted as JSON for programmatic use.

```bash
ckrv code diff [OPTIONS]
```

**Options**:

statuses, and file paths. Useful for getting an overview of
all features being tracked.

The repository must be initialized with `ckrv init` before
listing specs.

```bash
ckrv code spec list
```

**Examples**:

# List all specs
ckrv spec list

# List specs with JSON output
ckrv spec list --json

##### ckrv code spec new
