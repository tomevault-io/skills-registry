# PM Knowledge Base - Product Management Frameworks & Methodologies

This Skill provides comprehensive Product Management knowledge, frameworks, and best practices to support PM decision-making and execution.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this Skill when you need:
- Prioritization frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW, Kano Model, Value vs Effort)
- Goal-setting methodologies (OKR, SMART, North Star Metric)
- Customer research approaches (Jobs-to-be-Done, Persona creation, User interviews)
- Product strategy frameworks (Blue Ocean, Positioning, Go-to-Market)
- Roadmap planning and communication
- Metrics and analytics guidance

## Core PM Frameworks

### 1. Prioritization Frameworks

#### RICE Score
**Formula:** `(Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

**Components:**
- **Reach**: How many users/customers affected per time period
  - Example: 1000 users per quarter
- **Impact**: How much impact per user (scale)
  - 3 = Massive impact
  - 2 = High impact
  - 1 = Medium impact
  - 0.5 = Low impact
  - 0.25 = Minimal impact
- **Confidence**: How confident in estimates
  - 100% = High confidence
  - 80% = Medium confidence
  - 50% = Low confidence
- **Effort**: Person-months required
  - Example: 0.5 person-months

**Example:**
```
Feature: Social Login
- Reach: 1000 users/quarter
- Impact: 2 (high)
- Confidence: 80%
- Effort: 0.5 person-months

RICE Score = (1000 × 2 × 0.8) / 0.5 = 3200
```

Higher RICE score = Higher priority

#### MoSCoW Method
Categorize features into four buckets:

- **Must Have (P0)**: Critical for release, blocking
  - Without this, the release fails
  - Legal/regulatory requirements
  - Core value proposition

- **Should Have (P1)**: Important but not critical
  - Significant impact but workarounds exist
  - Can be delayed if necessary

- **Could Have (P2)**: Nice to have if time permits
  - Small impact
  - Easy to implement
  - Low risk

- **Won't Have (P3)**: Out of scope for this release
  - Explicitly documented
  - May reconsider for future releases

#### Value vs Effort Matrix

```
High Value, Low Effort → Quick Wins (Do First)
High Value, High Effort → Big Bets (Do Second)
Low Value, Low Effort → Fill-ins (Do Third)
Low Value, High Effort → Time Sinks (Don't Do)
```

**Application:**
1. Plot all features on 2x2 matrix
2. Focus resources on Quick Wins
3. Select 1-2 Big Bets per quarter
4. Use Fill-ins to balance workload
5. Avoid Time Sinks entirely

#### Kano Model
Categorize features by customer satisfaction impact:

- **Basic Needs**: Expected features (absence causes dissatisfaction)
  - Example: Product search, checkout

- **Performance Needs**: More is better (linear satisfaction)
  - Example: Page load speed, feature completeness

- **Delight Needs**: Unexpected features (presence causes joy)
  - Example: Personalized recommendations, Easter eggs

**Strategy:**
- Ensure all Basic Needs are met
- Compete on key Performance Needs
- Differentiate with Delight Needs

### 2. Goal-Setting Frameworks

#### OKR (Objectives and Key Results)

**Structure:**
```
Objective: Qualitative, inspiring, time-bound goal

Key Result 1: Measurable outcome (metric + target)
Key Result 2: Measurable outcome (metric + target)
Key Result 3: Measurable outcome (metric + target)
```

**Best Practices:**
- 3-5 Objectives per quarter
- 3-5 Key Results per Objective
- 70% achievable = good OKR
- Review weekly, grade quarterly (0-1 scale)

**Example:**
```
Objective: Become the go-to platform for small business productivity

Key Result 1: Increase MAU from 100K to 200K
Key Result 2: Improve Day 30 retention from 20% to 30%
Key Result 3: Achieve NPS of 50+
Key Result 4: Launch in 3 new markets
```

#### SMART Goals

- **S**pecific: Clear and unambiguous
- **M**easurable: Quantifiable
- **A**chievable: Realistic
- **R**elevant: Aligned with strategy
- **T**ime-bound: Has a deadline

**Example:**
❌ Bad: "Improve user engagement"
✅ Good: "Increase DAU from 10K to 15K by end of Q2"

#### North Star Metric

**Definition:** Single metric that best captures core value delivered

**Criteria:**
- Reflects customer value
- Measures product success
- Predicts revenue
- Easy to understand
- Actionable by team

**Examples:**
- Airbnb: Nights Booked
- Facebook: Daily Active Users
- Slack: Messages Sent
- Netflix: Hours Watched
- Spotify: Time Listening

**Supporting Metrics:**
- Input Metrics: Actions that drive North Star
- Output Metrics: Results of those actions
- Guardrail Metrics: Prevent gaming the system

### 3. Customer Research Frameworks

#### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

**Framework:**
```
When I [situation],
I want to [motivation],
So I can [expected outcome].
```

**Example:**
```
When I'm working on multiple projects,
I want to organize my tasks automatically,
So I can focus on important work without feeling overwhelmed.
```

**Application:**
1. Identify the "job" customers hire your product for
2. Understand context/situation (when)
3. Define desired progress (outcome)
4. Find competing solutions (alternatives)
5. Design product around the job, not demographics

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about the last time you [did this task]"
- "What were you trying to accomplish?"
- "What did you use? What didn't work?"
- "What would your ideal solution look like?"

#### Persona Creation

**Persona Template:**
```
Name: [Persona Name]

Demographics:
- Age: [Range]
- Location: [Where]
- Job Title: [Role]
- Income: [Range]
- Education: [Level]

Goals:
- Primary goal: [What they want to achieve]
- Secondary goals: [Additional objectives]

Pain Points:
- Pain 1: [Frustration, problem]
- Pain 2: [Challenge, obstacle]
- Pain 3: [Need, gap]

Behaviors:
- Shopping habits: [How they buy]
- Media consumption: [Where they spend time]
- Technology proficiency: [Skill level]

Motivations:
- [What drives them]
- [What they value]

Quote:
"[In their words, what matters most]"
```

**Types of Personas:**
- **Primary Persona**: Main target user (design for them)
- **Secondary Persona**: Additional user types (accommodate)
- **Anti-Persona**: Who you're NOT building for (explicitly exclude)

#### Customer Interview Best Practices

**Before Interview:**
- [ ] Define research questions
- [ ] Create interview script
- [ ] Recruit right participants (6-10 for patterns)
- [ ] Prepare recording setup

**During Interview:**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Listen more than talk (80/20 rule)
- Dig deeper with "Why?" (5 Whys technique)
- Observe behavior, not just words
- Stay neutral, don't lead

**After Interview:**
- Transcribe and tag key quotes
- Identify patterns across interviews
- Synthesize insights
- Share findings with team

**Good Questions:**
✅ "Walk me through the last time you [did task]"
✅ "What frustrated you about that experience?"
✅ "How did you work around that problem?"

**Bad Questions:**
❌ "Would you use a feature that does X?" (Hypothetical)
❌ "Do you like our product?" (Leading, not actionable)
❌ "What features do you want?" (Users don't know)

### 4. Product Strategy Frameworks

#### Blue Ocean Strategy

**Core Concept:** Create uncontested market space instead of competing in "red oceans"

**Four Actions Framework:**
1. **Eliminate**: Which factors can be removed?
2. **Reduce**: Which factors should be reduced below industry standard?
3. **Raise**: Which factors should be raised above industry standard?
4. **Create**: Which factors should be created that industry never offered?

**Example: Cirque du Soleil**
- Eliminated: Animals, star performers, multiple rings
- Reduced: Humor, thrill/danger
- Raised: Artistic music/dance, unique venues
- Created: Theme, refined environment

#### Positioning Statement

**Template:**
```
For [target customer]
Who [statement of need or opportunity],
[Product name] is a [product category]
That [key benefit, reason to buy].
Unlike [primary competitive alternative],
[Product name] [statement of primary differentiation].
```

**Example:**
```
For busy professionals
Who need to stay productive across multiple projects,
TaskMaster is a smart task management app
That automatically organizes and prioritizes your work.
Unlike Todoist or Asana,
TaskMaster uses AI to learn your patterns and suggest optimal schedules.
```

   - Partnerships

5. **Marketing Mix:**
   - Content marketing
   - SEO/SEM
   - Social media
   - PR and influencers
   - Events and community

6. **Sales Approach:**
   - Self-serve vs sales-assisted
   - Trial strategy
   - Onboarding plan

7. **Success Metrics:**
   - Acquisition: CAC, conversion rates
   - Activation: onboarding completion
   - Engagement: DAU/MAU
   - Retention: churn rate
   - Revenue: LTV, MRR
