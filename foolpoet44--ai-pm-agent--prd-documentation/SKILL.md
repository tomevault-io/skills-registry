# PRD Documentation Skill - Professional Product Requirements Writing

This Skill provides expertise in writing comprehensive, clear, and actionable Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and Feature Specifications.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this Skill when you need to:
- Write complete PRD documents
- Create feature specifications
- Define technical requirements
- Document acceptance criteria
- Specify non-functional requirements
- Create user stories with details
- Plan product launches

## Core Process

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

**Essential Inputs:**
- Validated business idea (from idea-agent)
- Target users and personas
- Business objectives and success metrics
- Key features and scope
- Technical constraints
- Timeline and resources

**If Missing, Ask:**
- "What problem does this product solve?"
- "Who are the primary users?"
- "What are the must-have features for MVP?"
- "What are the business goals and KPIs?"
- "What technical constraints exist?"
- "When is the target launch date?"

### Step 2: Use Reference Templates

**Always read these templates:**

```bash
# Use Read tool:
/reference/prd-templates/standard-prd-template.md
/reference/prd-templates/feature-spec-template.md
```

These provide:
- Complete PRD structure (15 sections)
- Feature specification format
- Acceptance criteria templates
- Technical requirements checklist
- Success metrics frameworks

## Best Practices

### Writing Style
✅ **Do:**
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Be specific and measurable
- Include examples
- Use tables and bullets
- Write from user perspective
- Define acronyms on first use

❌ **Don't:**
- Use vague terms ("user-friendly", "fast")
- Mix implementation with requirements
- Skip edge cases and errors
- Write lengthy paragraphs
- Assume technical knowledge

### Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Do:**
- Use Given-When-Then format
- Cover happy path, errors, edge cases
- Make testable and measurable
- Include visual feedback requirements
- Specify error messages

❌ **Don't:**
- Write vague criteria ("works well")
- Focus only on happy path
- Skip error handling
- Forget accessibility
- Leave untestable criteria

### Prioritization
Use MoSCoW:
- **P0 (Must Have)**: Blocking for launch
- **P1 (Should Have)**: Important, not blocking
- **P2 (Could Have)**: Nice to have
- **P3 (Won't Have)**: Out of scope

```

**Format:**
- Markdown with proper headings (##, ###)
- Tables for comparisons and data
- Code blocks for technical specs

## Example Output

See `/reference/prd-templates/standard-prd-template.md` for complete example.

## Integration Points

This Skill works with:
- **prd-agent**: Primary user of this skill
- **idea-generation**: Takes validated idea as input
- **userstory-documentation**: Provides requirements for story breakdown
- **pm-knowledge-base**: Uses OKR, metrics, prioritization frameworks

Always use reference templates as foundation, customizing for specific product needs.
