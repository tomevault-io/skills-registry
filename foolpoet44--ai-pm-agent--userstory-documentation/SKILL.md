# User Story Documentation Skill - Agile Story & Epic Writing

This Skill provides expertise in breaking down product requirements into actionable user stories, epics, and tasks with clear acceptance criteria.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this Skill when you need to:
- Break down PRD into user stories
- Create epics for large features
- Write acceptance criteria
- Decompose stories into tasks
- Estimate story points
- Prioritize backlog
- Plan sprints

## Core Process

### Step 1: Input Analysis

**Required Inputs:**
- Complete PRD (from prd-agent)
- Feature specifications
- User personas
- Business priorities

**If Missing:**
- Request PRD or feature list
- Clarify target users
- Understand technical constraints
- Confirm priority order

### Step 2: Use Reference Templates

**Always read these:**

```bash
# Use Read tool:
/reference/userstory-templates/epic-story-task-structure.md
/reference/userstory-templates/acceptance-criteria-guide.md
/reference/userstory-templates/estimation-techniques.md
```

These provide:
- Epic/Story/Task hierarchy
- INVEST criteria
- Given-When-Then format
- Story point estimation scales
- Prioritization frameworks

### Step 3: Epic-Story-Task Hierarchy

```
Epic (2-8 weeks, large feature area)
├── Story 1 (1-5 days, user-facing feature)
│   ├── Task 1.1 (2-8 hours, technical implementation)
│   ├── Task 1.2
│   └── Task 1.3
├── Story 2
│   ├── Task 2.1
│   └── Task 2.2
└── Story 3
```

### Step 4: Epic Template

```markdown
## Epic ID: [PROJ-E###]
## Epic: [Feature Area Name]

**Description:**
As a [user type],
I want [high-level capability],
So that [business value].

**Business Value:**
- [Why this matters to business]
- [Expected impact on revenue/users/metrics]
- [Strategic alignment]

**Success Metrics:**
- Metric 1: [KPI + Target value]
- Metric 2: [KPI + Target value]
- Metric 3: [KPI + Target value]

**User Stories in this Epic:**
- [ ] [PROJ-001]: [Story name]
- [ ] [PROJ-002]: [Story name]
- [ ] [PROJ-003]: [Story name]
- [ ] [PROJ-004]: [Story name]

**Timeline:** [4-6 weeks estimated]
**Priority:** High | Medium | Low
**Status:** Backlog | Planned | In Progress | Done
```

### Step 5: User Story Template

**INVEST Criteria Check:**
- **I**ndependent: Can develop in any order
- **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed
- **V**aluable: Delivers user value
- **E**stimable: Can be sized
- **S**mall: Fits in one sprint (1-2 weeks)
- **T**estable: Has clear acceptance criteria

**Story Format:**

```markdown
### Story ID: [PROJ-###]
**Title:** [Concise user action/outcome]

**User Story:**
As a [specific user type/persona],
I want to [specific action],
So that [specific benefit/value].

**Acceptance Criteria:**

#### Scenario 1: Happy Path
Given [precondition/context]
When [user action/event]
Then [expected outcome]
And [additional expected outcome]
And [system state]

#### Scenario 2: Error Handling
Given [precondition]
When [error condition occurs]
Then [error is handled]
And [user sees appropriate message]
And [system remains in safe state]

#### Scenario 3: Edge Case
Given [unusual but valid condition]
When [action]
Then [expected behavior]

#### Scenario 4: Validation
Given [invalid input condition]
When [user attempts action]
Then [validation error shown]
And [clear guidance provided]

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Performance: [e.g., Response time < 500ms]
- Security: [e.g., Input sanitized, XSS prevented]
- Accessibility: [e.g., Keyboard navigable, ARIA labels]
- Browser Support: [e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari latest 2]

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- Loading state: [e.g., Spinner while processing]
- Success feedback: [e.g., Toast "Item added to cart"]
- Error feedback: [e.g., Inline error under field]
- Empty state: [e.g., "No items found" message]

**Priority:** P0 (Must) | P1 (Should) | P2 (Could) | P3 (Won't)
**Story Points:** 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13
**Sprint:** [Sprint name/number or Backlog]
**Dependencies:** [Story IDs that must complete first]
**Technical Notes:** [Implementation considerations]
**Design:** [Link to mockups/wireframes]

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Code complete and peer reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No critical/high bugs
- [ ] Product Owner approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging
```

### Step 6: Acceptance Criteria Guidelines

**Format 1: Given-When-Then (Preferred)**
```
Given [context/precondition]
When [action/event]
Then [expected outcome]
And [additional outcome]
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear scenario structure
- Easy to automate (BDD)
- Covers context explicitly

**Example:**
```
Given I am a logged-in user on the product page
When I click "Add to Cart"
Then the item is added to my cart
And the cart count badge updates to show 1 item
And I see a confirmation toast "Item added successfully"
```

**Format 2: Checklist**
```
- [ ] User can [action]
- [ ] System validates [condition]
- [ ] Error displays when [scenario]
```

**Use for:**
- Simple, straightforward features
- Quick reference
- Less complex scenarios

**Coverage Checklist:**

Ensure AC covers:
- [ ] Happy path (successful scenario)
- [ ] Error handling (invalid inputs, system errors)
- [ ] Edge cases (boundary conditions, empty states)
- [ ] Validation rules (format, length, required fields)
- [ ] Performance (load time, response time)
- [ ] Security (auth, authorization, data protection)
- [ ] Accessibility (keyboard nav, screen reader)
- [ ] Visual feedback (loading, success, error states)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness (if applicable)

### Step 7: Task Breakdown

**Task Template:**

```markdown
#### Task ID: [PROJ-###-T#]
**Task:** [Technical action to be performed]

**Description:**
[Detailed explanation of what needs to be built/done]

**Technical Approach:**
- [Implementation method]
- [Libraries/frameworks to use]
- [APIs to call]
- [Files to create/modify]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 1]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 2]
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Code follows style guide
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] Peer reviewed

**Estimated Hours:** [X hours]
**Assigned To:** [Developer name or Unassigned]
**Status:** To Do | In Progress | In Review | Done
**Blocked By:** [Task IDs if applicable]
```

**Task Examples:**

```markdown
Story: User Registration

Task 1: Create User Registration API
- POST /api/auth/register endpoint
- Validate email format and password strength
- Hash password with bcrypt
- Store user in database
- Return JWT token
- Estimated: 4 hours

Task 2: Build Registration Form UI
- Email input with validation
- Password input with strength meter
- Confirm password with match validation
- Submit button with loading state
- Error message display
- Estimated: 3 hours

Task 3: Email Verification Service
- Generate verification token
- Send email via SendGrid
- Create verification endpoint
- Handle token expiration
- Estimated: 3 hours

Task 4: Write Tests
- Unit tests for validation logic
- Integration tests for API
- Component tests for UI
- E2E test for full flow
- Estimated: 4 hours
```

### Step 8: Story Point Estimation

**Fibonacci Scale:** 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

| Points | Time | Complexity | Example |
|--------|------|------------|---------|
| 1 | 1-2h | Trivial | Fix typo, update text |
| 2 | 2-4h | Simple | Add field to form |
| 3 | 4-8h | Straightforward | Basic CRUD operation |
| 5 | 1-2d | Moderate | User registration with email |
| 8 | 3-5d | Complex | Payment integration |
| 13 | 1w+ | Very complex | Full auth system - BREAK DOWN |
| 21+ | Too large | Epic-sized | MUST decompose |

**Estimation Factors:**
- Complexity (technical difficulty)
- Effort (amount of work)
- Uncertainty (unknowns, risks)
- Dependencies (external blockers)

**Planning Poker Process:**
1. Product Owner presents story
2. Team asks questions
3. Each member estimates privately
4. Reveal simultaneously
5. Discuss outliers (highest/lowest explain)
6. Re-estimate until consensus

### Step 9: Prioritization

**MoSCoW:**
- **P0 (Must Have)**: Critical, blocking for launch
- **P1 (Should Have)**: Important, not blocking
- **P2 (Could Have)**: Nice to have, time permitting
- **P3 (Won't Have)**: Out of scope this release

**RICE Score:**
```
RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Where:
- Reach: Users affected per quarter
- Impact: 3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low
- Confidence: 100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low
- Effort: Story points or person-months
```

**Example:**
```
Story: Social Login
- Reach: 1000 users/quarter
- Impact: 2 (high - reduces friction)
- Confidence: 80% (medium - tested pattern)
- Effort: 5 story points

RICE = (1000 × 2 × 0.8) / 5 = 320
```

Higher RICE = Higher priority

## Best Practices

### Writing User Stories
✅ **Do:**
- Focus on user value, not implementation
- Use specific personas (not "user")
- Keep independent when possible
- Make completable in one sprint
- Include "so that" benefit clause

❌ **Don't:**
- Write technical tasks as stories
- Skip the "so that" (why it matters)
- Make stories dependent unnecessarily
- Combine multiple features
- Use vague language

### Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Do:**
- Use Given-When-Then format
- Cover happy path, errors, edge cases
- Be specific and testable
- Include performance/security/accessibility
- Specify exact error messages
- Document loading/empty states

❌ **Don't:**
- Be vague ("works well", "is fast")
- Only test happy path
- Skip error handling
- Forget edge cases
- Leave untestable criteria
- Include implementation details

### Task Breakdown
✅ **Do:**
- Break into 2-8 hour chunks
- Include testing in tasks
- Assign clear ownership
- Specify technical approach
- Estimate hours realistically

❌ **Don't:**
- Create multi-day tasks
- Forget testing tasks
- Skip implementation details
- Leave tasks unassigned too long
- Underestimate complexity

## Output Format

**File Naming:**
```
[product]-user-stories-v[version].md
Example: study-planner-user-stories-v1.0.md
```

**Structure:**
```
# Product Name - User Stories

## Epic 1: [Name]
[Epic details]

### Story 1.1
[Story details]

### Story 1.2
[Story details]

## Epic 2: [Name]
[Repeat]
```

## Integration Points

This Skill works with:
- **userstory-agent**: Primary user of this skill
- **prd-documentation**: Takes PRD as input
- **pm-knowledge-base**: Uses estimation, prioritization frameworks

Always use reference templates to ensure consistency and completeness.
