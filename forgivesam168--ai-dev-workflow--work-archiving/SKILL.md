# Work Archiving Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill at **Stage 6 (Archive)** of the workflow when:
- Code review is approved and all changes are merged
- Need to finalize and document completed work
- Time to close out the change package
- Asked to "archive", "finalize", "close out this work"
- Completing the 6-stage workflow cycle

## Prerequisites

Before archiving:
- [ ] Code review completed (05-review.md exists with approval)
- [ ] All changes committed and pushed
- [ ] Tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Archiving Workflow

### Step 1: Review Change Package Status

Check the change package folder (`changes/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/`) for completeness:
- `01-brainstorm.md` — Initial requirements and risk assessment
- `02-decision-log.md` — Key decisions made
- `03-spec.md` — Specification (if standard path)
- `04-plan.md` — Implementation plan
- `05-review.md` — Code review results

### Step 2: Create Archive Summary

Create `changes/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/99-archive.md`:

```markdown
# Archive: [Feature Name]

**Date Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: ✅ Completed / ⚠️ Completed with Known Issues

## Summary
Brief description of what was implemented.

## Key Outcomes
- Outcome 1
- Outcome 2

## Commits
- [commit-hash] commit message
- [commit-hash] commit message

## Related Issues/PRs
- Closes #123
- Related to #456

## Known Issues / Technical Debt
- Issue 1 (tracked in #789)
- Issue 2 (documented in decision log)

## Lessons Learned
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Recommendations for future work
```

### Step 3: Update CHANGELOG

If `CHANGELOG.md` exists, add entry:

```markdown
## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- Feature description

### Changed
- Change description

### Fixed
- Fix description

### Security
- Security improvement description
```

If no CHANGELOG exists, consider creating one following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.

### Step 4: Commit and Tag (if applicable)

```bash
# Commit archive document
git add changes/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/99-archive.md
git commit -m "docs: archive change package for <feature-name>"

# Optional: Create release tag
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3
```

### Step 5: Close Related Issues/PRs

If using GitHub:
- Close related issues with reference to commits
- Update project boards
- Link PRs to completed work

### Step 6: Clean Up (Optional)

- [ ] Remove temporary files or branches
- [ ] Archive old change packages (if many exist)
- [ ] Update team documentation

## Output Format

### Archive Document (`99-archive.md`)

| Section | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Summary | Yes | Brief description of completed work |
| Key Outcomes | Yes | Bullet list of deliverables |
| Commits | Yes | List of Git commits with hashes |
| Related Issues/PRs | If applicable | References to GitHub issues/PRs |
| Known Issues | If applicable | Technical debt or limitations |
| Lessons Learned | Recommended | Retrospective notes |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Change package incomplete | Review missing files and complete them before archiving |
| Commits not yet pushed | Push changes to remote before finalizing |
| Review not approved | Return to Stage 5 (Review) to address feedback |
| No CHANGELOG exists | Create one or document in 99-archive.md |

## Integration with Workflow

This skill completes the 6-stage workflow:
1. Brainstorm → 2. Specification → 3. Planning → 4. Implementation → 5. Review → **6. Archive**

After archiving, the change package serves as:
- **Audit trail** for regulatory/compliance needs
- **Knowledge base** for future similar work
- **Onboarding material** for new team members
- **Reference** for technical decisions

- [Code & Security Review Skill](../code-security-review/SKILL.md) — Stage 5

## Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data in archive documents
- Redact customer/user information from examples
- If archiving includes security fixes, coordinate disclosure timing
- Ensure compliance with data retention policies
