# Universal CV Data Ingestion & Organization

<purpose>
Transform unstructured career data into the portfolio's content structure, ready for variant generation and "hired-on-sight" presentation.
</purpose>

<when_to_activate>
Activate when the user:
- Provides raw career data (Obsidian vault, CSV, zip, markdown)
- Says "ingest", "import", "process my data", "load my experience"
- Wants to populate the knowledge base from source files
- Has files in `source-data/` directory to process

**Trigger phrases:** "ingest", "import", "process", "load data", "parse my resume"
</when_to_activate>

## Input Directory

**Drop all source files in `source-data/`** — this directory is gitignored.

---

## Processing Workflow

### Phase 0: Schema Understanding (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**Objective**: Read and internalize the actual Zod schemas before writing ANY content.

**CRITICAL**: This step MUST be completed before any file writes. Schema mismatches were the #1 source of validation errors in past runs.

```bash
# Always read the schema file first
Read src/lib/schemas.ts
```

**Key Schema Constraints to Verify**:

| Content Type | Field | Constraint |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Skills | `skills` | `z.array(z.string())` — simple strings only, NOT objects |
| Case Study Media | `type` | `z.enum(['blog', 'twitter', 'linkedin', 'video', 'article', 'slides'])` |
| Testimonial | `featured` | `z.boolean()` — required, not optional |
| Experience | `highlights` | `z.array(z.string())` — simple strings only |
| Case Study CTA | `action` | `z.enum(['contact', 'calendly', 'linkedin'])` — only these 3 values |

**Before writing any file, confirm**:
1. ✅ Field types match schema exactly (string vs object vs array)
2. ✅ Enum values are from the allowed set
3. ✅ Required fields are present
4. ✅ Optional fields use correct null/undefined handling

---

### Phase 1: Data Discovery & Inventory

**Objective**: Map all source files before processing.

#### Step 1a: Check for Existing AI Summaries (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Before parsing raw files**, look for existing AI-generated summaries or reviews. These are often more structured and save significant parsing time.

```bash
# Look for AI review files
find source-data/ -name "*review*" -o -name "*summary*" -o -name "*gemini*" -o -name "*claude*" -o -name "*gpt*"

# Check for structured exports
find source-data/ -name "*.json" -o -name "*export*"
```

**If found**: Use as PRIMARY source, cross-reference with raw data for verification.

#### Step 1b: Inventory Raw Sources

```bash
# For Obsidian vault
find source-data/ -name "*.md" -type f | head -50

# For zip archive (extract first)
unzip -l source-data/*.zip | head -50

# Categorize by type
find source-data/ -type f \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.csv" -o -name "*.txt" -o -name "*.json" \)
```

Create an inventory table with confidence scores:
| File | Type | Category | Priority | Confidence |
|------|------|----------|----------|------------|
| gemini-review.md | AI Summary | All | HIGH | ⬛⬛⬛ High |
| work-history.md | Markdown | Experience | High | ⬛⬛⬜ Medium |
| skills.csv | CSV | Skills | Medium | ⬛⬛⬛ High |
| testimonials.txt | Text | Social Proof | High | ⬛⬜⬜ Low |

### Phase 2: Experience Enrichment

For each work role, extract/synthesize:

```yaml
# Target: content/experience/index.yaml
jobs:
  - company: "Company Name"
    role: "Job Title"
    period: "YYYY – YYYY"
    location: "City, State"
    logo: "/images/logos/company.svg"  # Optional, nullable
    url: "https://company.com"         # Company website - ALWAYS extract if available
    highlights:
      - "Achievement with specific metric (e.g., 15× revenue growth)"
      - "Technical accomplishment with stack details"
      - "Cross-functional impact with scope"
      - "Decision/trade-off that shows judgment"
      - "Scale indicator (users, transactions, team size)"
    tags: ["Domain1", "Tech1", "Skill1"]
```

**Enrichment criteria**:
- 3-4 highlights per role (focused, not exhaustive)
- Specific metrics > vague claims (SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant)
- Technologies and methodologies named
- Collaboration scope mentioned
- Key decisions with trade-offs

#### Product Links in Highlights (IMPORTANT)

**Highlights support markdown links** — use `[Product Name](url)` to link to shipped products, docs, or proof.

```yaml
# Example with inline product links
highlights:
  - "Shipped [Advanced API](https://ankr.com/docs/advanced-api/) from 0→1, serving 1M+ daily requests"
  - "Built [Xbox royalties blockchain](https://ey.com/case-study) achieving 99% faster processing"
  - "Launched [Playground V2](https://play.flow.com/) improving developer onboarding by 60%"
```

**Link priority for highlights**:
1. Live product/demo URLs (highest credibility)
2. Official documentation
3. NPM/PyPI package pages
4. GitHub repos
5. Case studies or press coverage

**Why this matters**: Recruiters verify claims. A clickable link to a live product instantly validates the work is real.

#### Link Extraction (IMPORTANT)

**Always extract and verify company/project URLs** so viewers can quickly validate the work is real.

**Sources for URLs**:
1. Company websites mentioned in source docs
2. LinkedIn company pages
3. Product URLs, app store links
4. GitHub repos, documentation sites
5. Press releases, news articles

**Link extraction process**:
```bash
# Search source files for URLs
grep -oE 'https?://[^\s<>"]+' [SOURCE_FILES]

# Common patterns to look for
- "company.com", "startup.io", "project.xyz"
- LinkedIn: linkedin.com/company/[name]
- GitHub: github.com/[org]
- Product Hunt, Crunchbase links
```

**Validation**:
- Verify URL is still active (not 404)
- Prefer official company domain over third-party
- For defunct companies: use archive.org link or LinkedIn

| Company Type | URL Priority |
|-------------|--------------|
| Active startup | Official website (e.g., mempools.com) |
| Enterprise | Company careers/about page |
| Acquired | Parent company or press release |
| Defunct | LinkedIn or archive.org |

#### Confidence Scoring for Experience Data

Track extraction confidence for each data point:

| Confidence | Criteria | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| ⬛⬛⬛ **High** | Exact quote from source, verified metric, named source | Use directly |
| ⬛⬛⬜ **Medium** | Synthesized from multiple sources, approximated metric | Use with note |
| ⬛⬜⬜ **Low** | Inferred, placeholder metric like "[X%]", uncertain date | Flag for user review |

**Before writing experience file**:
1. List all LOW confidence items for user confirmation
2. Mark uncertain metrics with `[VERIFY]` prefix in draft
3. Only write after user confirms or provides corrections

#### Pre-Validation Check (Before Writing)

```yaml
# Validate structure matches schema BEFORE writing
# ExperienceSchema expects:
jobs:
  - company: string      # Required
    role: string         # Required
    period: string       # Required: "YYYY – YYYY" format
    location: string     # Required
    logo: string | null  # Optional
    url: string | null   # Optional - but ALWAYS try to populate!
    highlights: string[] # Required: array of STRINGS (not objects!)
    tags: string[]       # Required
```

### Phase 3: Case Study Mining

Identify projects with case study potential:

**Criteria**:
- Clear problem → approach → result arc
- Quantifiable impact (revenue, users, time saved)
- Decision points with reasoning
- Lessons learned (what worked, what didn't)

```yaml
# Target: content/case-studies/NN-slug.md frontmatter
---
id: [next_available_number]
slug: project-slug
title: "Project Title"
company: "Company Name"
year: "YYYY-YY"
tags: [Tag1, Tag2, Tag3]
duration: "X months"
role: "Your Role"

hook:
  headline: "One-line impact statement"
  impactMetric:
    value: "XX%"
    label: "metric label"
  subMetrics:
    - value: "YY"
      label: "secondary metric"
  thumbnail: /images/case-study-slug.png

cta:
  headline: "Call to action question"
  subtext: "Optional elaboration"
  action: calendly  # or: contact, linkedin
  linkText: "Let's talk →"
---

[Markdown body with: Challenge, Approach, Key Decision, Execution, Results, Learnings]
```

### Phase 4: Testimonial Extraction

#### Distinguishing Personal vs Project Testimonials (CRITICAL)

**Personal testimonials** (USE these):
- About the individual: "Working with [Name]...", "[Name] is exceptional at..."
- Collaboration focused: "...a pleasure to work with", "...always delivered"
- Skill endorsements: "...best product manager I've worked with"
- Growth observations: "...grew from... to..."

**Project testimonials** (DO NOT use as personal):
- About the project/product: "The blockchain solution transformed..."
- Company endorsements: "Microsoft's approach to..."
- Generic team praise: "The team delivered..."

#### Detection Heuristics

**High-confidence personal testimonial signals**:
```
✅ Contains person's name + positive verb: "[Name] led", "[Name] designed"
✅ Uses "I" + relationship: "I worked with", "I hired", "I managed"
✅ Personal qualities: "collaborative", "thoughtful", "proactive"
✅ Recommendation language: "I recommend", "would hire again"
✅ Source: LinkedIn recommendation, performance review
```

**Low-confidence / Project quote signals**:
```
⚠️ No personal name mentioned
⚠️ Focuses on deliverable, not person
⚠️ Source: press release, case study, marketing material
⚠️ Generic praise: "great work", "successful project"
```

#### Search Patterns for Testimonials

```bash
# Phrases indicating personal testimonials
grep -i "working with \[name\]" [SOURCE]
grep -i "I recommend" [SOURCE]
grep -i "pleasure to work" [SOURCE]
grep -i "\[name\] is" [SOURCE]
grep -i "one of the best" [SOURCE]

# LinkedIn recommendation patterns
grep -i "I had the opportunity" [SOURCE]
grep -i "I've had the pleasure" [SOURCE]
```

#### Testimonial Quality Checklist

Before including a testimonial:
- [ ] Is it about the PERSON, not just the project?
- [ ] Does it include specific details (not generic praise)?
- [ ] Can the source be verified (LinkedIn, named author)?
- [ ] Is the author's relationship clear (manager, peer, report)?

```yaml
# Target: content/testimonials/index.yaml
testimonials:
  - quote: >
      Full testimonial text with specific details about
      collaboration, impact, or skills demonstrated.
    author: "Full Name"  # Or "Engineering Lead" if anonymized
    initials: "FN"
    role: "Their Role"
    company: "Company Name"
    avatar: null  # Or path to image
    featured: true  # Required boolean - for prominent display
```

#### Gap Handling

If no valid personal testimonials found:
1. **Flag as HIGH priority gap** in gap analysis
2. Suggest manual follow-up actions:
   - Export LinkedIn recommendations
   - Request recommendations from past colleagues
   - Check old emails for praise snippets
3. **DO NOT fabricate** or use project quotes as personal testimonials

### Phase 5: Skills Taxonomy

#### CRITICAL: Schema Constraint

**The skills schema expects SIMPLE STRINGS, not objects!**

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - This will fail validation
categories:
  - name: "Technical Leadership"
    skills:
      - name: "Platform Architecture"
        level: "expert"
        evidence: "..."

# ✅ CORRECT - Simple string array
categories:
  - name: "Technical Leadership"
    skills:
      - "Platform Architecture"
      - "API Design"
      - "System Integration"
```

#### Preserving Evidence (Workaround)

Since the schema doesn't support evidence fields, preserve context using YAML comments:

```yaml
# Target: content/skills/index.yaml
categories:
  - name: "Technical Leadership"
    skills:
      # Evidence: Designed multi-client validator infra at Anchorage
      - "Platform Architecture"
      # Evidence: Shipped Ankr Advanced APIs, 1M+ daily requests
      - "API Design"

  - name: "Web3 & Blockchain"
    skills:
      # Evidence: First smart contract at Microsoft (2016)
      - "Ethereum"
      # Evidence: ETF-grade validator provisioning
      - "Staking Infrastructure"
```

#### Pre-Validation Check

```typescript
// SkillsSchema from src/lib/schemas.ts:
SkillsSchema = z.object({
  categories: z.array(z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    skills: z.array(z.string())  // <-- STRINGS ONLY!
  }))
});
```

**Before writing skills file**:
1. Verify each skill is a plain string
2. Move any evidence/level data to comments
3. Test parse the YAML structure mentally

### Phase 6: Validation & Gap Analysis

```bash
# Validate all content against Zod schemas
npm run validate

# Check for gaps
```

**Gap checklist**:
- [ ] All required fields populated
- [ ] No placeholder URLs (demo.com, example.com)
- [ ] Metrics are specific, not vague ("improved" → "improved by 40%")
- [ ] Missing metrics marked with `[METRIC]` for user to fill (e.g., "Increased revenue by [METRIC]%")
- [ ] Each experience has 3-4 highlights (focused, not exhaustive)
- [ ] Product links included for every shipped product/tool
- [ ] All dates in consistent format (YYYY or YYYY–YY)

---

## Quality Criteria

### "Hired-on-Sight" Standard

Every piece of content should pass this test:

- **Specific**: Numbers, names, technologies — not vague claims
- **Verified**: Can point to source data
- **Impactful**: Shows business/user value, not just activity
- **Consistent**: Formatting, dates, terminology aligned
- **Complete**: No "TODO" or placeholder content

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Full content validation
npm run validate

# Build to catch any issues
npm run build

# Preview locally
npm run dev
```

---

## Tips

- **Preserve source references**: Note which file each piece of data came from
- **Prioritize metrics**: "Shipped feature" < "Shipped feature used by 10K users"
- **Anonymize carefully**: If removing names, keep role context
- **Check dates**: Ensure no overlapping periods, consistent formatting
- **Cross-reference**: Same project might appear in experience AND as case study
- **Images**: Store in `/public/images/`, reference as `/images/filename.png`

---

## Dependencies

- Node.js (for validation scripts)
- `npm run validate` command
- Zod schemas in `src/lib/schemas.ts`

No additional packages required.
