# CV Knowledge Query

<purpose>
Rapid retrieval from the knowledge base to answer questions about experience, find achievements, or gather data for content generation.
</purpose>

<when_to_activate>
Activate when the user:
- Asks "What have I done with [technology/skill]?"
- Wants to find achievements for a specific theme
- Needs metrics for a particular company/period
- Asks "Show me my [type] experience"
- Wants to understand relationships between experiences

**Trigger phrases:** "find", "search", "what's my experience", "show me", "list achievements"
</when_to_activate>

## Knowledge Base Schema

### Entities (content/knowledge/index.yaml)

```yaml
entities:
  companies:
    - id: string       # anchorage, microsoft, etc.
      name: string
      period: string
      role: string
      domain: string

  themes:
    - id: string       # institutional-crypto, developer-experience
      label: string
      keywords: [string]

  skills:
    - id: string       # ethereum, api-design
      label: string
      category: string
```

### Relationships

```yaml
relationships:
  - from: achievement:id
    to: company:id | skill:id | theme:id
    type: achieved_at | demonstrates | belongs_to | contains | generated_from
```

### Achievements (content/knowledge/achievements/*.yaml)

```yaml
id: string
headline: string
metric:
  value: string
  unit: string
  context: string
situation: string
task: string
action: string
result: string
skills: [string]
themes: [string]
companies: [string]
years: [number]
good_for: [string]
```

## Quick Search (Deterministic Script)

For keyword-based searches, **USE THE SCRIPT FIRST** — it's faster and consistent:

```bash
# Search by keywords
npm run search:evidence -- --terms "crypto,staking,institutional"

# With JSON output for processing
npm run search:evidence -- --terms "crypto,staking" --json
```

The script returns:
- Matching achievements and stories sorted by relevance
- Relevance scores (strong ≥70%, moderate 40-70%, weak <40%)
- Matched terms, skills, and themes
- Snippets for quick review

**Use the script when:**
- User asks about specific keywords
- Quick search without deep analysis needed
- Need alignment scoring for job fit

**Use manual querying when:**
- Deep relationship traversal needed
- Need full STAR narrative (situation, task, action, result)
- Complex cross-referencing across entities

## Query Patterns

### Query by Theme
**User**: "What's my institutional crypto experience?"

**Script-first approach:**
```bash
npm run search:evidence -- --terms "institutional,crypto,custody"
```

**For deep dive:**
1. Find theme `institutional-crypto` in index
2. Query relationships where `to: theme:institutional-crypto`
3. Load matching achievements
4. Return summary with metrics

**Output Format**:
```
## Institutional Crypto Experience

### Achievements:
1. **ETH Staking Zero Slashing** (Anchorage, 2024-25)
   - Zero slashing events, Galaxy + institutional clients
   - Skills: ethereum, staking, compliance

2. **L2 Protocol Integrations** (Anchorage, 2024-25)
   - 7+ protocols shipped, 40% faster integration
   - Skills: l2s, compliance
```

### Query by Skill
**User**: "Show me my API design work"

**Process**:
1. Find skill `api-design` in index
2. Query achievements where `skills` includes `api-design`
3. Return with context and metrics

### Query by Company
**User**: "What did I accomplish at Microsoft?"

**Process**:
1. Find company `microsoft` in index
2. Query achievements where `companies` includes `microsoft`
3. Include period and role context

### Query by Keyword
**User**: "Find achievements related to revenue growth"

**Script-first approach:**
```bash
npm run search:evidence -- --terms "revenue,growth,ARR"
```

**For manual search:**
1. Search theme keywords for "revenue"
2. Search achievement headlines/results for "revenue"
3. Return ranked by relevance

### Query for Role Fit
**User**: "What achievements fit a Platform PM role?"

**Script-first approach:**
```bash
npm run search:evidence -- --terms "platform,infrastructure,api,scale"
```

**For deeper analysis:**
1. Parse role keywords: platform, infrastructure, scale
2. Match themes: infrastructure, developer-experience
3. Match `good_for` arrays in achievements
4. Return ranked list with reasoning

## Response Formats

### Summary Format (default)
```
Found 3 achievements matching "[query]":

1. **[Headline]** ([Company], [Year])
   Metric: [value] [unit]
   Themes: [theme1], [theme2]

2. ...
```

### Detail Format (on request)
```
## [Achievement Headline]

**Context**: [Company] | [Period] | [Role]
**Impact**: [metric.value] [metric.unit]

### Situation
[situation text]

### Task
[task text]

### Action
[action text]

### Result
[result text]

**Best for**: [good_for items]
```

### Metrics Format (for comparisons)
```
| Achievement | Metric | Value | Company | Year |
|------------|--------|-------|---------|------|
| [headline] | [unit] | [value] | [company] | [year] |
```

## Cross-Reference Queries

### Find Related Achievements
**User**: "What else relates to the ETH staking work?"

**Process**:
1. Load `eth-staking-zero-slashing` achievement
2. Find shared themes: `institutional-crypto`, `infrastructure`
3. Find shared skills: `ethereum`, `compliance`
4. Query other achievements with overlap
5. Rank by relationship strength

### Find Gaps
**User**: "What skills don't have strong achievements?"

**Process**:
1. List all skills in index
2. Count achievements per skill
3. Flag skills with <2 achievements
4. Suggest areas for content development

## Query Shortcuts

| User Says | Query |
|-----------|-------|
| "my blockchain work" | themes: [enterprise-blockchain, institutional-crypto] |
| "growth stories" | themes: [revenue-growth] |
| "developer tools" | themes: [developer-experience] |
| "recent work" | years: [2024, 2025] |
| "Microsoft days" | companies: [microsoft] |
| "startup experience" | companies: [ankr, forte, dapper] |
