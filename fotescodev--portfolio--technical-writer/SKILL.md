# Technical Writer

*Documentation that developers actually want to read.*

<purpose>
Create documentation that helps users accomplish specific tasks. Every doc answers: What is this? Why should I care? How do I start?
</purpose>

<when_to_activate>
Activate when:
- Creating or improving README files
- Writing API documentation
- Building getting started guides or quickstarts
- Creating tutorials or how-to guides
- Writing reference documentation
- Documenting CLI tools or SDKs

**Trigger phrases:** "docs", "documentation", "readme", "guide", "tutorial", "API docs"
</when_to_activate>

---

## Core Philosophy

**Documentation is a product.** It has users, and those users have jobs to be done. Every piece of documentation should help someone accomplish something specific.

The three questions every doc must answer:
1. **What is this?** (in 10 seconds or less)
2. **Why should I care?** (the value proposition)
3. **How do I start?** (immediate actionability)

---

## The 2025 Documentation Stack

### Progressive Disclosure Architecture

Structure documentation in layers:

```
Layer 1: README / Landing (30 seconds)
   ↓
Layer 2: Quickstart (5 minutes)
   ↓
Layer 3: Tutorials (30 minutes)
   ↓
Layer 4: Reference (as needed)
   ↓
Layer 5: Deep Dives (when ready)
```

**Never front-load complexity.** Users discover depth when they need it.

### The Four Documentation Types

| Type | Purpose | User State | Format |
|------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Tutorial** | Learning | "Teach me" | Step-by-step journey |
| **How-to** | Problem-solving | "Help me do X" | Task-focused steps |
| **Reference** | Information | "What does X do?" | Accurate, complete, dry |
| **Explanation** | Understanding | "Why does X work this way?" | Discussion, context |

**Don't mix types.** A tutorial that turns into a reference confuses everyone.

---

## README Structure (The Front Door)

Every README follows this hierarchy:

```markdown
# Project Name

One-line description of what this does and who it's for.

## Quick Start

[Fastest possible path to "hello world"]

## Installation

[Complete installation for all platforms]

## Usage

[Common patterns with examples]

## Documentation

[Links to full docs]

## Contributing

[How to help]

## License

[Legal stuff]
```

### The 10-Second Test

A developer landing on your README should understand:
- What the project does
- Whether it's relevant to them
- How to try it immediately

If they have to scroll to understand what it is, you've failed.

### The One-Line Description Formula

```
[Project Name] is a [category] that [primary action] for [target user].
```

**Good:**
> Fastify is a web framework that provides the fastest HTTP server for Node.js

**Bad:**
> Fastify is a highly performant, low overhead web framework built on top of a highly optimized architecture leveraging modern JavaScript features...

## Code Examples: The Heart of Technical Docs

### The Copy-Paste Standard

Every code example must be:
1. **Complete** - Runnable without modification
2. **Correct** - Actually works when copied
3. **Contextual** - Shows where the code goes
4. **Current** - Uses latest stable API

### Code Block Anatomy

```typescript
// Context: Where does this code go?
// File: src/api/users.ts

import { createClient } from '@example/sdk'  // Dependencies shown

// Create client with required config
const client = createClient({
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,  // Environment variables, not hardcoded
  region: 'us-west-2'
})

// Usage pattern - the actual thing they're learning
const users = await client.users.list({
  limit: 10,
  status: 'active'
})

// What to expect
console.log(users)
// → [{ id: '123', name: 'Alice', ... }, ...]
```

### Example Progression

Start simple, build complexity:

```typescript
// Basic usage
const result = await api.query('SELECT * FROM users')

// With options
const result = await api.query('SELECT * FROM users', {
  timeout: 5000,
  cache: true
})

// With error handling
try {
  const result = await api.query('SELECT * FROM users')
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof QueryTimeout) {
    // Handle timeout specifically
  }
  throw error
}
```

### Language-Specific Conventions

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use async/await over callbacks
- Show TypeScript types when relevant
- Include `// →` output comments

**Python:**
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Include docstring examples
- Show both sync and async patterns where applicable

**CLI:**
```bash
# Comment explaining what this does
$ command --flag value
Expected output here
```

Note: Always prefix commands with `$` to distinguish input from output.

### Anti-Patterns in Code Examples

**Never:**
```typescript
// Bad: Placeholders without explanation
const client = new Client(YOUR_API_KEY)

// Bad: Partial code
// ... some code ...
const result = await fetch()

// Bad: Outdated patterns
var data = null
fetch(url, function(err, res) { ... })

// Bad: Console.log without expected output
console.log(response)
```

**Instead:**
```typescript
// Good: Environment variable pattern
const client = new Client(process.env.API_KEY)

// Good: Complete context
import { Client } from '@example/sdk'
const client = new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
const result = await client.fetch('/users')

// Good: Modern patterns
const data: User | null = await fetchUser(id)

// Good: Expected output shown
console.log(response)
// → { status: 200, data: { id: '123', name: 'Alice' } }
```

## API Documentation

### Endpoint Documentation Template

```markdown
## Create User

Creates a new user in the system.

### Request

`POST /api/v1/users`

#### Headers

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Authorization | Yes | Bearer token |
| Content-Type | Yes | Must be `application/json` |

#### Body Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| email | string | Yes | User's email address |
| name | string | Yes | Display name (2-100 chars) |
| role | string | No | One of: `admin`, `user`. Default: `user` |

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "role": "admin"
  }'
```

### Response

#### Success (201 Created)

```json
{
  "id": "usr_abc123",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "role": "admin",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

#### Errors

| Status | Code | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 400 | `invalid_email` | Email format is invalid |
| 409 | `email_exists` | User with this email already exists |
| 422 | `name_too_short` | Name must be at least 2 characters |
```

### SDK Documentation Pattern

```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new user in the system.
 *
 * @param options - User creation options
 * @returns The created user object
 * @throws {ValidationError} When email format is invalid
 * @throws {ConflictError} When email already exists
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const user = await client.users.create({
 *   email: 'alice@example.com',
 *   name: 'Alice Smith'
 * })
 * console.log(user.id) // → 'usr_abc123'
 * ```
 */
async create(options: CreateUserOptions): Promise<User>
```

## Writing Style Guide

### Voice & Tone

**Be direct.** Technical readers want information, not persuasion.

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "You might want to consider..." | "Use..." |
| "It's worth noting that..." | [Just state it] |
| "In order to..." | "To..." |
| "Please ensure that you..." | [Just give the instruction] |
| "The system will then proceed to..." | "Then..." |

### Second Person, Active Voice

**Good:** "Configure the database connection."
**Bad:** "The database connection should be configured by the user."

### Present Tense

**Good:** "This function returns a promise."
**Bad:** "This function will return a promise."

### Sentence Structure

- Lead with the action: "Run `npm install` to install dependencies."
- One idea per sentence
- Maximum 25 words per sentence for instructions
- Use lists for 3+ related items

### Technical Terminology

**Be consistent.** Pick one term and stick with it:
- "function" not "method/function/procedure"
- "parameter" not "argument/parameter/input"
- Define terms on first use, then use them consistently

**Be precise:**
- "Click" for mouse, "Tap" for touch, "Select" for either
- "Enter" for typing, "Paste" for clipboard
- "Run" for commands, "Execute" for code

## 2025 Best Practices

### AI-Era Documentation

Your documentation will be read by AI assistants helping developers. Optimize for both:

**For humans:**
- Visual hierarchy with headers and whitespace
- Contextual explanations
- Progressive disclosure

**For AI parsing:**
- Structured, consistent formatting
- Clear section boundaries
- Explicit relationships between concepts
- Complete, runnable code examples

### Accessibility

- Alt text for all images
- Text alternatives for diagrams (ASCII or descriptions)
- Color-independent meaning (don't rely on color alone)
- Logical heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skipping)
- Code examples with syntax highlighting classes, not just color

### Versioning

Every doc should indicate:
- What version it applies to
- When it was last updated
- Where to find docs for other versions

```markdown
> **Version:** This document applies to v2.x. For v1.x docs, see [here](link).
> **Last updated:** 2025-01-15
```

### Searchability

- Use the words developers actually search for
- Include common misspellings in metadata (not visible text)
- Repeat key terms naturally
- Create descriptive headings (not "Overview" but "User Authentication Overview")

### Maintenance Signals

Help future maintainers:
- Date stamps on time-sensitive content
- `TODO:` markers for known gaps
- Links to related issues/PRs for complex decisions
- Clear ownership (who maintains this section?)

## Skill Compositions

### technical-writer + dmitrii-writing-style
**Creates:** Documentation with authentic voice

Use when documentation needs personality while maintaining technical accuracy. Apply dmitrii-writing-style's directness and warmth to technical content.

### technical-writer + first-time-user
**Creates:** Validated documentation

Write docs, then test them with first-time-user simulation. Fix friction points. Repeat until smooth.

### technical-writer + ultrathink
**Creates:** Thoughtful documentation architecture

Before writing, ultrathink the information architecture. Who are the users? What are their jobs to be done? What's the right structure?

### technical-writer + serghei-qa
**Creates:** Battle-tested examples

Write the docs, then have Serghei review the code examples for edge cases, error handling, and security issues.
</skill_compositions>

## Anti-Patterns

**Wall of Text**
Break it up. Use headers, lists, code blocks, and whitespace.

**Tutorial-Reference Hybrid**
Don't explain concepts in reference docs. Don't list every option in tutorials.

**Placeholder Examples**
`YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` without explaining how to get one is a dead end.

**Screenshot-Only Documentation**
Screenshots break. Always include text alternatives.

**Assuming the Happy Path**
Document what happens when things go wrong.

**Writing for Yourself**
You already know how it works. Write for someone who doesn't.

---

## The Meta-Rule

The best documentation disappears. When someone finishes using your docs, they should feel like the product was so intuitive they barely needed help.

If your docs feel like a maze, your product probably is too. Documentation problems are often product problems in disguise.

*Now: what are we documenting?*
