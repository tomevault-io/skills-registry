description: Update project documentation (architecture.md, gene-transfusion.md, README.md) to reflect recent code changes. Use after implementing features, fixing bugs, or refactoring code that affects documented behavior. Use when this capability is needed.

Update documentation to reflect recent code changes on this branch.

## Step 1 -- Gather context

Run `git diff main...HEAD` to see all changes on this branch.
If the diff is very large, also run `git diff main...HEAD --stat` for an overview.

## Step 2 -- Read current docs

Read `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/gene-transfusion.md`, and `README.md`.

## Step 3 -- Determine what needs updating

The three docs serve different audiences:

- `docs/architecture.md` is a reference for AI agents and LLMs that work on this codebase.
  It should be comprehensive and information-dense -- optimized for machine consumption,
  not human readability. Include type signatures, interface definitions, package relationships,
  and behavioral details that help an LLM understand the system quickly.
- `docs/gene-transfusion.md` is a user-facing guide for the gene transfusion feature. It covers
  extraction, gene JSON format, components, composed convergence, cross-language synthesis, and
  CLI reference. Update it when gene-related code changes (internal/gene/*, attractor component
  logic, scenario component field, CLI flags for --genes/--language).
- `README.md` is for human developers. Keep it concise, user-friendly, and focused on
  usage, quick start, and high-level concepts.

Common updates include:
- New packages, files, or interfaces added to the architecture doc
- New CLI flags or commands added to README
- Changed data structures or type definitions
- New capabilities, algorithms, or features
- Updated package dependency DAG
- Gene/component changes reflected in gene-transfusion.md

## Step 4 -- Make changes

If documentation needs updates, make the changes directly. Keep the existing style and structure.
Only update sections that are affected by the code changes -- do not rewrite unrelated sections.

## Step 5 -- Verify

Run `make docs` to sync any embedded code blocks (embedmd).
Run `make docs-check` to verify everything is in sync.

## Step 6 -- Stage

If you made any changes, stage them: `git add docs/ README.md`
Do NOT commit, push, or create a PR. Leave the changes staged for the user to review.

If the documentation is already up-to-date and nothing needs changing, say so and do nothing.
