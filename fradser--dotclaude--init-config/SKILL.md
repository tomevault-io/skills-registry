## Initialization
Run phases in order because later phases depend on saved choices from earlier phases.

## Phase 1: Environment Discovery
**Goal**: detect installed languages, tools, and package managers.

**Actions**:
1. Detect installed languages (Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, Java, Docker, and others).
2. Detect package manager options for selected ecosystems.
3. Store detection results for Phase 4 option generation.

## Phase 2: Developer Profile
**Goal**: detect or collect developer identity for personalization.

**Actions**:
1. Run `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` to detect developer info.
2. If both are detected, store as `developer_name` and `developer_email` for renderer arguments and proceed to Phase 3.
3. If either is missing, ask the user directly through conversation:
   - If name is missing: "I couldn't detect your name from git config. What name would you like to use? (or reply 'skip' to omit)"
   - If email is missing: "I couldn't detect your email from git config. What email would you like to use? (or reply 'skip' to omit)"
4. Store the user's responses (or empty values if skipped) as `developer_name` and `developer_email` for renderer arguments.

## Phase 3: Testing Methodology
**Goal**: choose the testing approach.

**Actions**:
Ask with header `Testing Methodology`:
- `BDD first, then TDD (Recommended)` -> BDD-driven TDD with Red-Green-Refactor
- `BDD only` -> Gherkin scenarios without TDD cycle
- `TDD only` -> Test-driven development without BDD scenarios
- `None` -> No specific testing methodology
Store the choice as `testing_mode` (bdd-tdd | bdd | tdd | none) for Phase 7 renderer arguments.

## Phase 3.5: Memory Management (Optional)
**Goal**: decide whether to add CLAUDE.md memory instructions.

**Actions**:
Ask with header `Memory`:
- `Skip (Recommended)`
- `Include memory rules`
Store boolean `include_memory` for renderer arguments. Do not append memory text manually.

## Phase 4: Technology Stack & Package Manager Selection
**Goal**: choose languages and package managers.

**Actions**:
1. Use **AskUserQuestion** (`multiSelect: true`) for technology stacks.
2. Generate options from detected technologies and mark detected ones as recommended.
3. For selected languages with multiple managers, ask preference:
- Node.js: npm, pnpm (Recommended), yarn, bun.
- Python: pip, uv (Recommended), poetry.
- Only show managers detected on the machine.
4. Store ordered stack selections as `language:::package_manager` for renderer arguments.

## Phase 5: Renderer Input Preparation
**Goal**: prepare deterministic renderer inputs from user selections.

**Actions**:
1. Normalize each selected stack into ordered renderer input format `language:::package_manager`.
- Keep selection order unchanged.
2. For languages without explicit package manager choice, use `language:::` (empty manager).
3. Keep language keys exact (`Node.js`, `Python`, `Rust`, `Swift`, `Go`, `Java`) when available; do not invent aliases.
4. Never call online search in this phase.

## Phase 6: Style Preference
**Goal**: choose emoji usage policy in generated CLAUDE.md.

**Actions**:
Ask with header `Style`:
- `No Emojis (Recommended)`
- `Use Emojis`
Store boolean `use_emojis` for renderer arguments that control emoji policy text in output.



## Phase 7: Assembly & Generation
**Goal**: generate final content through one renderer script.

**Actions**:
1. Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/render-claude-config.sh` with:
- `--target-file $HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `--testing-mode <bdd-tdd|bdd|tdd|none>` (from Phase 3)
- `--include-memory <true|false>`
- `--use-emojis <true|false>`
- Optional `--developer-name` and `--developer-email`
- Repeated `--stack "language:::package_manager"` entries from Phase 5
2. Let the renderer handle all assembly concerns: fragment assembly, testing content injection, developer profile, technology stack section, optional memory section, and final write.
3. Do not manually post-edit renderer output; if output shape is wrong, fix inputs or renderer behavior.



## Phase 8: Write CLAUDE.md
**Goal**: report write and backup results from renderer.

**Actions**:
1. Use renderer output to confirm:
- Target path written.
- Backup path created when an existing target file was present.
2. Report:
- File and backup locations.
- Developer info and testing mode.
- Selected technology stacks and package managers.
- Renderer rule-application summary: which stacks received local rule lines and which did not.

## Best Practices
- Keep workflow progressive and deterministic.
- Prefer local references over generated prose for stack guidance.
- Keep generated constraints concise and enforceable.
- Always back up existing files before overwrite.
