name: refactor
description: Executes automated refactoring for specific files, directories, or semantic queries. This skill should be used when the user asks to refactor specific files or directories, simplify recently changed code, clean up dead code in a limited scope, or invokes "/refactor". Use when this capability is needed.

# Refactor Command

Execute automated refactoring for $ARGUMENTS using `refactor:code-simplifier` agent.

## Pre-operation Checks
**Goal**: Ensure scope resolution is deterministic before launching the agent.

**Actions**:
1. Run `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` and continue even if false when explicit paths are provided
2. Normalize arguments by trimming whitespace and preserving quoted path segments
3. Treat an empty argument list as "recent changes" mode

## Phase 1: Determine Target Scope
**Goal**: Identify files to refactor based on arguments or session context.

**Actions**:
1. If arguments provided: verify as file/directory paths using Glob
2. If paths exist: use them directly as refactoring scope
3. If paths don't exist: treat arguments as semantic query, search codebase with Grep
4. If no arguments: run `git diff --name-only` to find recently modified code files
5. If no recent changes found: inform user and exit without refactoring

See `references/scope-determination.md` for search strategies and edge cases.

## Phase 2: Launch Refactoring Agent
**Goal**: Execute `refactor:code-simplifier` agent with aggressive mode enabled.

**Actions**:
1. Launch `refactor:code-simplifier` agent with target scope and aggressive mode flag
2. Pass scope determination method (paths, semantic query, or session context)
3. Agent auto-loads `refactor:best-practices` skill and applies language-specific patterns

See `references/agent-configuration.md` for detailed Task parameters.

## Phase 3: Summary
**Goal**: Report comprehensive summary of changes.

**Actions**:
1. Report total files refactored and changes categorized by improvement type
2. List best practices applied and legacy code removed
3. Suggest tests to run and provide rollback command tailored to actual scope (for example: `git restore --worktree --staged <files>`)

See `references/output-requirements.md` for detailed summary format.

## Requirements

- Execute immediately without user confirmation
- Refactor ALL matching files when semantic search returns multiple results
- Direct users to `/refactor-project` for project-wide scope
- Preserve behavior and public interfaces unless user explicitly requests a behavior change
