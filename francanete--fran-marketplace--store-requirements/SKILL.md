# Chrome Web Store Requirements

## Developer Program Policies

### Core Principles

1. **Single Purpose** - Extension must have one clear purpose
2. **Transparency** - Clearly describe functionality
3. **Privacy** - Respect user data
4. **Security** - No malicious behavior
5. **Quality** - Work as advertised

### Policy Categories

| Category | Key Requirements |
|----------|-----------------|
| Content | No malware, spam, hate, or illegal content |
| Data | Minimal collection, clear disclosure |
| Functionality | Works as described, no deception |
| Monetization | Clear about paid features |
| User Experience | No unwanted behavior |

---

## Single Purpose Requirement

### What It Means

Your extension should do **ONE thing well**, not bundle unrelated features.

**ACCEPTABLE:**
- Tab manager with grouping, search, and organization
- Note-taking with formatting, tags, and sync
- Ad blocker with filter customization

**NOT ACCEPTABLE:**
- Tab manager + weather widget + game
- Coupon finder + screenshot tool
- Anything with "multi-tool" bundled features

### How to Define Purpose

```markdown
## Single Purpose Statement
[Extension Name] helps users [primary action] by [method].

Example:
"TabMaster helps users organize their browser tabs by providing
grouping, search, and session management features."
```

### Feature Justification

All features should relate to the core purpose:

| Feature | Core: Tab Management | Justified? |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| Tab grouping | Direct | ✅ |
| Tab search | Direct | ✅ |
| Session save | Related | ✅ |
| Tab statistics | Enhancement | ✅ |
| Weather widget | Unrelated | ❌ |
| Ad blocking | Unrelated | ❌ |

## Permission Justifications

### When Required

Justifications required for:
- `tabs`
- `webNavigation`
- `history`
- `bookmarks`
- `topSites`
- `browsingData`
- `<all_urls>` or broad host permissions

### Writing Good Justifications

**Structure:**
```
Permission: [permission name]

1. What we use it for:
   [Specific feature that needs this permission]

2. Why it's necessary:
   [Why the feature can't work without it]

3. What we don't do:
   [Reassurance about data not collected/shared]
```

**Example - tabs permission:**
```
Permission: tabs

1. What we use it for:
   - Display tab titles in our tab search feature
   - Show favicon in the tab list
   - Enable "Switch to Tab" functionality

2. Why it's necessary:
   Our core tab management features require reading tab metadata
   to provide search and organization capabilities.

3. What we don't do:
   - We do not track browsing history
   - We do not transmit URLs to external servers
   - Tab data is only stored locally on the user's device
```

### Common Permission Justifications

**activeTab:**
```
Required to read the current page content when the user clicks
the extension icon. Only activated on user gesture, no passive
access to browsing data.
```

**storage:**
```
Used to save user preferences and extension state locally.
No data is transmitted to external servers.
```

**alarms:**
```
Required for scheduling periodic background tasks like
syncing saved data and checking for updates.
```
