name: worktree
description: Manage git worktrees for the current repository. Use when asked to create a worktree, set up parallel development, work on multiple branches simultaneously, or manage existing worktrees. Triggers on phrases like "create worktree", "new worktree", "parallel branch", "list worktrees", or "remove worktree". Use when this capability is needed.

# Git Worktree Management

Manage git worktrees for parallel development.

## What Are Worktrees?

Git worktrees let you have multiple working directories from the same repo, each on a different branch. This enables running parallel dev servers, working on multiple features, or testing changes side-by-side.

## Commands

All commands should be run from the main repository directory or use the repo path.

### List Worktrees
```bash
git worktree list
```

### Create New Worktree with New Branch
```bash
# Creates a new branch from the base branch and checks it out in the new worktree
git worktree add -b <new-branch-name> <path> <base-branch>

# Example: Create ../myrepo-feature on new branch "feature-xyz" based on master
git worktree add -b feature-xyz ../myrepo-feature master
```

### Create Worktree from Existing Branch
```bash
git worktree add <path> <existing-branch>

# Example
git worktree add ../myrepo-hotfix hotfix-branch
```

### Create Detached Worktree (same commit, no branch)
```bash
git worktree add --detach <path> <commit-or-branch>
```

### Remove Worktree
```bash
git worktree remove <path>
```

### Prune Stale Worktree Info
```bash
git worktree prune
```

## Workflow

1. **Creating a worktree:**
   - Ask user for branch name and optional directory path
   - Default path convention: `../<repo-name>-<identifier>` (sibling to main repo)
   - Determine if creating new branch or using existing
   - Create the worktree
   - Remind user to install dependencies in the new directory

2. **After creation, inform user:**
   ```
   Worktree created at <path> on branch <branch>

   Next steps:
   cd <path>
   <package-manager> install
   ```

3. **Listing worktrees:**
   - Show all current worktrees with their branches and paths
   - Indicate which is the main worktree (bare)

4. **Removing worktrees:**
   - First list current worktrees
   - Confirm with user which to remove
   - Run the remove command
   - Optionally prune if needed

## Important Notes

- The same branch cannot be checked out in multiple worktrees
- Each worktree needs its own dependency installation (`yarn install`, `npm install`, etc.)
- Worktrees share the same `.git` directory (saves disk space)
- Use `--detach` flag to create a worktree at a specific commit without a branch
- Worktree paths are typically siblings to the main repo (e.g., `../repo-feature`)
