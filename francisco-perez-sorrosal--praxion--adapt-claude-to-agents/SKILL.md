description: Generate or refresh a project-local `AGENTS.md.tmpl` for Praxion Codex onboarding from a project's root `CLAUDE.md`. Use when `install.sh codex <project>` needs a Codex source template, when removing Claude-only operational details while preserving portable project guidance, or when refreshing a previously generated Codex project template. Use when this capability is needed.

# Adapt Claude To Agents

Generate a project-local Codex template source from a project's root
`CLAUDE.md`. The output is `AGENTS.md.tmpl`, not the final compiled
`AGENTS.md`.

## Workflow

1. Read the project's root `CLAUDE.md`.
2. Preserve portable project guidance: project description, repository layout,
   build/test commands, verification paths, and cross-project conventions.
3. Remove or rewrite Claude-only operational details that do not belong in a
   Codex project template.
4. Write a reviewable `AGENTS.md.tmpl` that can be merged with Praxion's shared
   Codex baseline.

## Bundled Script

Use `scripts/claude_to_agents.py` for deterministic generation during
`install.sh codex`. The installer may call the script directly; the output still
follows this skill's workflow and contract.

## Guardrails

- Treat `AGENTS.md.tmpl` as project-local source.
- Treat final `AGENTS.md` as compiled output.
- Do not copy Praxion's shared Codex baseline into the generated project
  template.
- Favor conservative removal over speculative rewriting when Claude-only
  details are ambiguous.
