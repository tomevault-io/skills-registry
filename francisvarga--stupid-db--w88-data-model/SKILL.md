## Common Analytical Questions

| Business Question | Data Approach |
|-------------------|---------------|
| "Which members are most active?" | PageRank on Member nodes or count GameOpened per member |
| "Are there shared devices (fraud)?" | Graph: Device nodes with >1 Member edge |
| "Which games are trending?" | Trend detection on GameOpened counts per gameUid |
| "Error hotspots?" | Co-occurrence: Error × Game or Error × Platform |
| "Member segments?" | KMeans on member feature vectors |
| "Popup effectiveness?" | Temporal: PopupSeen → GameOpened sequence frequency |
| "Churn risk?" | Anomaly detection on member activity decline |
| "Affiliate quality?" | PageRank/stats on Affiliate → Member → activity chains |

## Data Quality Notes

- `memberCode` can be null for unauthenticated API errors
- `fingerprint` only present in Login events
- `gameUid` format varies by provider
- Timestamps are UTC
- Some fields have inconsistent casing across event types (normalization needed)

## SAFETY: Never modify D:\w88_data
