# GitHub Plain Text API Access

This skill enables direct access to plain text versions of GitHub content without HTML rendering, perfect for analyzing code changes, reviewing files, and processing GitHub data.

## Overview

GitHub provides multiple URL "hacks" that return content in plain text or structured formats:
- **PRs & Commits** → `.diff` or `.patch` files
- **File content** → Raw text via `raw.githubusercontent.com`
- **Gists** → Raw files
- **Markdown** → Unrendered via `?plain=1`
- **Feeds** → Atom XML for releases and commits

## Quick Start

### Pull Request Diffs

**Standard PR URL:**
```
https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

**Plain text diff:**
```
https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123.diff
```

**Patch format (with metadata):**
```
https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123.patch
```

**Ignore whitespace:**
```
https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123.diff?w=1
```

## URL Transformations

### 1. Pull Requests → Diff/Patch

Transform any PR URL by appending `.diff` or `.patch`:

**Examples:**
```
# Original
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/pull/600

# Unified diff
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/pull/600.diff

# Mail-ready patch (includes commit messages, author info)
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/pull/600.patch

# Ignore whitespace changes
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/pull/600.diff?w=1
```

**When to use:**
- Code reviews: Analyze exact changes
- CI/CD: Process diffs programmatically
- Linters: Check only modified lines
- Documentation: Show what changed

**Important limitation - Review Comments:**

PR URLs with review comment fragments (e.g., `#discussion_r2506786717`) require HTML fetch:

```
# URL with review comment
https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123#discussion_r2506786717

# .diff format won't show the comment
https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123.diff  ❌ No review comments

# Fetch HTML to see comments and discussion
https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123  ✅ Includes review comments
```

**When to use HTML instead of .diff:**
- PR has fragment identifier (`#discussion_...`, `#issuecomment-...`)
- Need to see review comments or discussion threads
- Want PR description and metadata
- .diff/.patch returns 403 error

### 2. Commits → Diff/Patch

Works identically to PRs:

**Examples:**
```
# Original
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/commit/dee113a

# Diff format
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/commit/dee113a.diff

# Patch format
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/commit/dee113a.patch
```

**When to use:**
- Review single commits
- Extract commit metadata
- Apply patches locally
- Analyze specific changes

### 3. Compare Views → Diff/Patch

Compare two branches, tags, or commits:

**Examples:**
```
# Original compare
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/compare/main...feature-branch

# Diff format
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/compare/main...feature-branch.diff

# Patch format
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/compare/main...feature-branch.patch

# Ignore whitespace
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/compare/main...feature-branch.diff?w=1
```

**When to use:**
- Review entire feature branches
- Generate release notes
- Audit changes between versions
- Pre-merge analysis

### 4. File Content → Raw Text

Convert any blob URL to raw content:

**Method 1: raw.githubusercontent.com**
```
# Original
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/blob/main/README.md

# Raw content
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/main/README.md
```

**Method 2: ?raw=1 parameter**
```
# Redirects to raw.githubusercontent.com
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/blob/main/README.md?raw=1
```

**Pattern:**
```
# Original blob URL
https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<ref>/<path/to/file>

# Raw content
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<ref>/<path/to/file>
```

**When to use:**
- Read file contents directly
- Download configuration files
- Process text files
- Fetch scripts for execution

### 5. Gist Raw Content

**Latest version of a gist file:**
```
https://gist.github.com/<user>/<gist-id>/raw/
```

**Specific file in gist:**
```
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<gist-id>/raw/<filename>
```

**Example:**
```
# Gist URL
https://gist.github.com/franklinbaldo/abc123

# Raw content (latest)
https://gist.github.com/franklinbaldo/abc123/raw/

# Specific file
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/franklinbaldo/abc123/raw/example.py
```

**When to use:**
- Fetch shared code snippets
- Download configuration examples
- Process gist data programmatically

### 6. Unrendered Markdown

View Markdown source without rendering:

**Examples:**
```
# Original
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/blob/main/README.md

# Plain text (still HTML page, but content in <pre>)
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/blob/main/README.md?plain=1

# With line numbers
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L14-L30
```

**When to use:**
- Analyze Markdown formatting
- Copy exact source text
- Check for rendering issues
- Link to specific lines

### 7. Atom Feeds (XML)

**Releases feed:**
```
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/releases.atom
```

**Commits feed (per branch):**
```
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/commits/main.atom
https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/commits/feature-branch.atom
```

**When to use:**
- Monitor releases programmatically
- Build RSS readers
- Track commit activity
- Integration with feed aggregators

## Advanced: GitHub API with Media Types

For scripting and API access, use `Accept` headers to get diff/patch content:

**Examples:**
```bash
# Get PR diff via API
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.diff" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/franklinbaldo/egregora/pulls/600

# Get PR patch via API
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.patch" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/franklinbaldo/egregora/pulls/600

# Get commit diff via API
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.diff" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/franklinbaldo/egregora/commits/dee113a
```

**Media types:**
- `application/vnd.github.diff` - Unified diff format
- `application/vnd.github.patch` - Patch format with metadata
- `application/vnd.github.raw` - Raw file content
- `application/vnd.github.html` - Rendered HTML

## Practical Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Code Review Assistant

When a user shares a PR for review:

```markdown
User: "Can you review this PR? https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/pull/600"

Claude workflow:
1. Transform URL: https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/pull/600.diff
2. Fetch the diff using Bash + curl:
   curl -s https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/pull/600.diff
3. Analyze changes in plain text
4. Provide code review feedback
```

### Example 2: File Content Analysis

When analyzing a specific file:

```markdown
User: "What does this file do? https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/blob/main/src/egregora/privacy/anonymizer.py"

Claude workflow:
1. Transform to raw: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/main/src/egregora/privacy/anonymizer.py
2. Fetch raw content with curl:
   curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/main/src/egregora/privacy/anonymizer.py
3. Analyze code structure
4. Explain functionality
```

### Example 3: Compare Branches

When checking differences between branches:

```markdown
User: "What changed between main and this feature branch?"

Claude workflow:
1. Create compare URL: https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/compare/main...feature-branch.diff
2. Fetch diff with curl:
   curl -s https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/compare/main...feature-branch.diff
3. Summarize changes by file
4. Highlight key modifications
```

### Example 4: Commit Investigation

When investigating a specific commit:

```markdown
User: "What did commit dee113a change?"

Claude workflow:
1. Transform: https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/commit/dee113a.patch
2. Fetch patch with curl (includes commit message + author):
   curl -s https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/commit/dee113a.patch
3. Parse changes
4. Explain purpose and impact
```

## URL Pattern Recognition

### Recognize these patterns in user messages:

**Pull Request:**
```
github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{number}
→ Add .diff or .patch
```

**Commit:**
```
github.com/{owner}/{repo}/commit/{sha}
→ Add .diff or .patch
```

**File Blob:**
```
github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{ref}/{path}
→ Replace github.com with raw.githubusercontent.com
→ Remove /blob/
```

**Compare:**
```
github.com/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{base}...{head}
→ Add .diff or .patch
```

**Gist:**
```
gist.github.com/{user}/{id}
→ Add /raw/ for latest
→ Use gist.githubusercontent.com/{user}/{id}/raw/{file}
```

## Decision Tree: Which Format to Use?

### Use `.diff` when:
- You need a unified diff format
- Analyzing line-by-line changes
- Processing with diff tools
- Comparing code changes
- Lightweight format preferred

### Use `.patch` when:
- You need commit metadata (author, message, date)
- Applying changes with `git apply`
- Generating changelogs
- Email-based workflows
- Full context is important

### Use `raw` when:
- Reading complete file contents
- Downloading files
- Processing configuration
- Executing scripts
- No diff needed, just content

### Use `?plain=1` when:
- Analyzing Markdown formatting
- Showing source in documentation
- Linking to specific lines
- Debugging rendering issues

### Use `.atom` when:
- Monitoring for updates
- RSS/feed integration
- Tracking releases or commits
- Building notification systems

## Best Practices

### 1. Smart URL Transformation

When a user shares a GitHub URL, use this strategy:

1. **Check for fragment identifiers** (`#discussion_...`, `#issuecomment-...`)
   - If present: Fetch HTML (comments only visible in HTML)
   - If absent: Try plain text first

2. **For plain text attempts:**
   - Identify URL type (PR, commit, file, etc.)
   - Transform to appropriate format (.diff, .patch, raw)
   - Fetch the content with curl
   - If 403/error: Fall back to HTML (curl the HTML page)

3. **Analyze and respond**

**Example 1 - Simple PR:**
```markdown
User: "Check this PR: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42"

Strategy:
1. No fragment identifier → Try plain text
2. Transform: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42.diff
3. Fetch diff with curl:
   curl -sS https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42.diff
4. If 403: Fall back to HTML:
   curl -sS https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42
5. Analyze and provide insights
```

**Example 2 - PR with review comment:**
```markdown
User: "Look at this comment: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42#discussion_r12345"

Strategy:
1. Fragment identifier detected (#discussion_r12345) → Use HTML
2. Fetch with curl:
   curl -sS https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42
3. Locate the specific review comment in HTML
4. Provide context and analysis
```

### 2. Use Whitespace Filtering

For cleaner diffs, add `?w=1` to ignore whitespace:
```
# Before
https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42.diff

# After (ignore whitespace)
https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42.diff?w=1
```

### 3. Prefer Raw Content for Files

Don't parse HTML when you can get raw text:
```
# Bad: Scraping rendered HTML
https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/README.md

# Good: Direct raw content
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owner/repo/main/README.md
```

### 4. Check for Private Repos

Raw URLs respect GitHub permissions:
- Public repos: Anyone can access raw content
- Private repos: Requires authentication
- If fetch fails, inform user about access requirements

### 5. Handle Large Diffs Gracefully

Large PRs/commits may have truncated diffs:
- GitHub truncates very large diffs
- Check for "diff is too large" messages
- Consider fetching specific files instead
- Use API with pagination for complete data

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

**404 Not Found:**
- Check repo/branch/file exists
- Verify user has access (private repos)
- Confirm SHA/ref is correct

**403 Forbidden:**
- Common with redirected .diff/.patch URLs (patch-diff.githubusercontent.com)
- Private repos require authentication
- **Fallback strategy**: Fetch the HTML page instead
- Example: If `pull/123.diff` fails with 403, try fetching `pull/123` as HTML

**Redirect Required:**
- `github.com` URLs may redirect to other domains
- `.diff`/`.patch` URLs redirect to `patch-diff.githubusercontent.com` (may cause 403)
- **Recommended**: Try plain text first, fall back to HTML if 403 occurs
- Use `raw.githubusercontent.com` directly for files

**Rate Limiting:**
- Anonymous API calls: 60/hour
- Authenticated: 5,000/hour
- Raw content URLs: No rate limit
- Use raw URLs when possible

**Large Content:**
- Files over 1MB may not display
- Use API with authentication for large files
- Consider streaming for very large files

### Fallback Strategy

When plain text formats fail (403, 404, or other errors):

1. **Try plain text first**: Use curl to fetch `{url}.diff` or `{url}.patch`
2. **If 403/error occurs**: Fall back to HTML page with curl
3. **HTML advantages**:
   - Works for private repos you have access to
   - Includes review comments and discussion threads
   - Shows PR descriptions and metadata
4. **HTML disadvantages**:
   - Requires parsing rendered content
   - Larger payload
   - May include UI elements

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# User shares: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Attempt 1: Try .diff format
curl -sS -f https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123.diff
# Result: 403 Forbidden (exits with error due to -f flag)

# Attempt 2: Fallback to HTML
curl -sS https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
# Result: Success - includes code changes, comments, and discussion
```

**curl error handling pattern:**
```bash
# Try .diff, fallback to HTML on error
curl -sS -f https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123.diff || \
  curl -sS https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

## Integration with Claude Code Tools

### Use Bash + curl for Content Fetching

**IMPORTANT:** In this environment, use the Bash tool with `curl` instead of WebFetch.

```markdown
Claude workflow:
1. User shares: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
2. Transform: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123.diff
3. Fetch with Bash: curl -s https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123.diff
4. Analyze fetched diff
5. Respond with insights
```

**Example Bash commands:**
```bash
# Fetch PR diff
curl -s https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123.diff

# Fetch commit patch
curl -s https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/abc123.patch

# Fetch raw file
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owner/repo/main/README.md

# Fetch with error handling
curl -sS -f https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123.diff || echo "Failed to fetch"
```

**curl options:**
- `-s` : Silent mode (no progress bar)
- `-S` : Show errors even in silent mode
- `-f` : Fail silently on HTTP errors (404, 403, etc.)
- `-L` : Follow redirects

### Combine with Other Skills

**With code review:**
- Fetch `.diff` with curl → analyze changes → provide feedback

**With documentation:**
- Fetch raw markdown with curl → check formatting → suggest improvements

**With testing:**
- Fetch `.patch` with curl → identify test coverage gaps → recommend tests

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Pull Request / Commit
{url}.diff                   # Unified diff
{url}.patch                  # Patch with metadata
{url}.diff?w=1              # Ignore whitespace

# File Content
# Replace: github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{ref}/{path}
# With:     raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{ref}/{path}

# Or append
{blob_url}?raw=1            # Redirects to raw

# Gist
gist.github.com/{user}/{id}/raw/                    # Latest
gist.githubusercontent.com/{user}/{id}/raw/{file}   # Specific

# Markdown
{blob_url}?plain=1          # Unrendered source
{blob_url}?plain=1#L10-L20  # With line numbers

# Feeds
{repo_url}/releases.atom           # Releases
{repo_url}/commits/{branch}.atom   # Commits

# Compare
{repo_url}/compare/{base}...{head}.diff    # Diff
{repo_url}/compare/{base}...{head}.patch   # Patch
```

## Summary

When users share GitHub URLs:

1. **Detect** fragment identifiers (`#discussion_...`, `#issuecomment-...`)
   - If present → Use HTML (required for comments)
   - If absent → Try plain text first

2. **Recognize** the URL type (PR, commit, file, compare, gist)

3. **Transform** to appropriate plain text format (.diff, .patch, raw)

4. **Fetch** the content using Bash + curl
   - Use: `curl -sS {transformed_url}`
   - If 403/error → Fall back to HTML page with curl

5. **Analyze** the content and **respond** with insights

### Key Takeaways

✅ **Plain text first** - Faster, cleaner, easier to parse
✅ **HTML fallback** - When plain text fails or comments needed
✅ **Know the patterns** - .diff, .patch, raw.githubusercontent.com
✅ **Handle errors gracefully** - 403 on .diff? Try HTML
✅ **Fragment identifiers** - Always require HTML fetch

This skill minimizes HTML scraping while providing direct access to GitHub's structured content formats, with smart fallbacks when needed.

Remember: GitHub makes it easy to access plain text versions of almost any content—you just need to know the right URL patterns and when to fall back!
