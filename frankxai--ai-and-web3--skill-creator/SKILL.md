## Interactive Creation Flow

When creating a new skill:

### Step 1: Discovery
```
What domain does this skill cover?
> [User provides domain]

What specific problem does it solve?
> [User describes problem]

When would someone use this skill?
> [User gives scenarios]
```

### Step 2: Structure
```
Based on your answers, I'll create:
- Category: technical/
- Name: [suggested-name]
- Core concepts: [list]

Does this look right?
```

### Step 3: Content
```
Let me draft the skill content...
[Generate SKILL.md]

Review and refine:
- [ ] Is the purpose clear?
- [ ] Are examples accurate?
- [ ] Anything missing?
```

### Step 4: Integration
```
Updating README.md to include new skill...
Testing skill invocation...
Done! Use with: /skill [skill-name]
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly: Check for outdated patterns
- Quarterly: Add new learnings
- Annually: Archive unused skills

### Version Updates
```yaml
# When to bump versions:
version: 1.0.0  # Initial release
