# Documentation Patterns

> **Documentation that people actually read and use**

This skill provides frameworks for writing technical documentation that serves its readers effectively.

## Core Principles

### 1. Documentation Is a Product
Treat docs like software: design, iterate, test, improve.

### 2. Different Docs for Different Goals
Tutorials, references, and explanations serve different purposes. Don't mix them.

### 3. Write for Scanning
Most readers don't read linearly. Structure for quick answers.

## The Documentation System (Diataxis)

Four distinct documentation types, each with a specific purpose:

```
                        PRACTICAL                    THEORETICAL
                    (Learning-oriented)          (Understanding-oriented)
                            │                            │
   ┌────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────┼────────────────────┐
   │                        │                            │                    │
   │     TUTORIALS          │      EXPLANATION           │    ACQUISITION     │
   │  (Learning by doing)   │  (Understanding context)   │    (Studying)      │
   │                        │                            │                    │
   │                        │                            │                    │
   ├────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────┼────────────────────┤
   │                        │                            │                    │
   │     HOW-TO GUIDES      │      REFERENCE             │    APPLICATION     │
   │  (Accomplishing tasks) │  (Looking up information)  │    (Working)       │
   │                        │                            │                    │
   └────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
```

### 1. Tutorials (Learning)

**Purpose:** Teach a newcomer how to get started
**Reader:** New, wants to learn
**Form:** Lessons that lead through steps

```markdown

```markdown
# Button Component API

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `variant` | `'primary' \| 'secondary' \| 'ghost'` | `'primary'` | Visual style |
| `size` | `'sm' \| 'md' \| 'lg'` | `'md'` | Button size |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Disables interaction |
| `isLoading` | `boolean` | `false` | Shows loading state |
| `onClick` | `() => void` | - | Click handler |

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```jsx
<Button>Click me</Button>
```

### With Variant
```jsx
<Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>
```

### Loading State
```jsx
<Button isLoading>Saving...</Button>
```

## Accessibility
- Uses `<button>` element for proper semantics
- Supports keyboard activation (Enter, Space)
- Has visible focus state
- Announces loading state to screen readers
```

**Reference Checklist:**
- [ ] Complete coverage of all options
- [ ] Consistent format throughout
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified
- [ ] Examples for each concept
- [ ] Easy to scan/search

### 4. Explanation (Understanding)

**Form:** Discursive, contextual prose

```markdown
# Understanding Our Component Architecture

## Why Components?

Our design system is built on the principle of composition.
Rather than creating complex, monolithic UI pieces, we build
small, focused components that combine to create any interface.

This approach has several benefits:

**Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others...

**Testability**: Small components are easy to test in isolation...

**Consistency**: Shared components ensure visual consistency...

## The Component Hierarchy

Components exist at different levels of abstraction:

### Primitives
The building blocks: Button, Input, Text...
These have no business logic, only UI concerns.

### Patterns
Compositions of primitives: FormField, Card, Modal...
These solve common UI patterns.

### Features
Compositions with business logic: LoginForm, UserCard...
These connect UI to application state.

## Design Decisions

### Why We Chose Radix UI

When evaluating component libraries, we considered...
We chose Radix because...

### Our Styling Approach

We use Tailwind CSS with CSS variables because...
The trade-offs of this approach include...
```

**Explanation Checklist:**
- [ ] Provides context and background
- [ ] Explains "why" not just "what"
- [ ] Connects to bigger picture
- [ ] Uses analogies when helpful
- [ ] Doesn't include step-by-step instructions

## Code Documentation

### Function Documentation (JSDoc)

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the total price including tax.
 *
 * @param items - Array of items with price and quantity
 * @param taxRate - Tax rate as decimal (e.g., 0.1 for 10%)
 * @returns Total price with tax applied
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const total = calculateTotal(
 *   [{ price: 100, quantity: 2 }],
 *   0.1
 * );
 * // Returns: 220
 * ```
 *
 * @throws {Error} If taxRate is negative
 */
function calculateTotal(
  items: Array<{ price: number; quantity: number }>,
  taxRate: number
): number {
  if (taxRate < 0) {
    throw new Error('Tax rate cannot be negative');
  }
  const subtotal = items.reduce(
    (sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity,
    0
  );
  return subtotal * (1 + taxRate);
}
```

### Component Documentation

```typescript
/**
 * A customizable button component with multiple variants.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Primary button
 * <Button onClick={handleClick}>Submit</Button>
 *
 * // Secondary button with icon
 * <Button variant="secondary" icon={<PlusIcon />}>
 *   Add Item
 * </Button>
 * ```
 */
interface ButtonProps {
  /** Visual style variant */
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost';
  /** Size of the button */
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  /** Whether the button is disabled */
  disabled?: boolean;
  /** Icon to display before the label */
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  /** Click handler */
  onClick?: () => void;
  /** Button contents */
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

### When to Comment (and When Not To)

```yaml
Write Comments For:
  - Why decisions were made
  - Non-obvious edge cases
  - Complex algorithms
  - Workarounds for bugs
  - Public API documentation

Don't Comment:
  - What the code does (code should be clear)
  - Every line
  - Obvious implementations
  - TODOs without tickets

Example Bad Comment:
  // Increment counter by 1
  counter += 1;

Example Good Comment:
  // Using >= instead of > to handle floating point rounding errors
  // See issue #1234 for details
  if (value >= threshold) {
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice and Tone

```yaml
Technical Writing Voice:

  Be Direct:
    Bad: "It is recommended that you should..."
    Good: "We recommend..." or just state the thing

  Be Specific:
    Bad: "This might cause issues"
    Good: "This causes a memory leak in Chrome"

  Use Active Voice:
    Bad: "The button is clicked by the user"
    Good: "The user clicks the button"

  Address the Reader:
    Bad: "One can configure settings in..."
    Good: "You can configure settings in..."
```

### Formatting Best Practices

```yaml
Headings:
  - Use sentence case (Capitalize only first word)
  - Keep short and scannable
  - Use hierarchy consistently

Lists:
  - Use bullets for unordered items
  - Use numbers for sequential steps
  - Keep items parallel in structure

Code:
  - Use inline code for short references: `variable`
  - Use code blocks for examples
  - Always specify language for syntax highlighting

Links:
  - Use descriptive text, not "click here"
  - Link to specific sections when possible
```

### Inclusive Language

```yaml
Avoid:
  - "Simply" / "Just" / "Easy" (dismissive)
  - "Obviously" / "Clearly" (assumes knowledge)
  - Gendered pronouns when unnecessary
  - Jargon without explanation

Use:
  - "First" instead of "First off"
  - Specific technical terms (defined)
  - "They" for generic singular
```

## Documentation Structure

### Information Architecture

```yaml
Organization Principles:

  By User Journey:
    - Getting started → Core concepts → Advanced

  By Task:
    - Authentication → Authorization → User management

  By Feature:
    - Components → Hooks → Utilities

  Navigation:
    - Clear hierarchy
    - Searchable
    - Cross-linked
```

### Page Structure

```markdown
# Page Title

Brief intro paragraph explaining what this page covers and
who it's for.

## Section 1

Content with examples...

### Subsection 1.1

More specific content...

## Section 2

Content...

## Related

- [Related Page 1](./related1.md)
- [Related Page 2](./related2.md)
```

## Maintenance

### Keeping Docs Fresh

```yaml
Documentation Debt Signals:
  - Screenshots that don't match UI
  - Code examples that don't compile
  - Broken links
  - Outdated version numbers
  - Missing recent features

Prevention:
  - Doc review in PR checklist
  - Automated link checking
  - Version docs with code
  - Regular doc audits (quarterly)
```

### Doc Review Checklist

```markdown
