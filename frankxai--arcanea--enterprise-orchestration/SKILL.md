# Enterprise Orchestration

> **Coordinate AI teams at enterprise scale with reliability and governance**

Enterprise Orchestration provides the patterns, protocols, and infrastructure for running multiple AI agent teams across a large organization. This goes beyond basic orchestration to address the complexities of enterprise: governance, compliance, scale, and cross-team coordination.

## Enterprise Challenges

### Why Enterprise Is Different

```yaml
Scale Challenges:
  - Multiple teams running AI agents simultaneously
  - Hundreds of tasks per day
  - Cross-team dependencies
  - Resource contention

Governance Challenges:
  - Audit requirements
  - Compliance constraints
  - Access control
  - Decision accountability

Coordination Challenges:
  - Conflicting priorities
  - Shared resources
  - Handoffs between teams
  - Consistent standards

Quality Challenges:
  - Maintaining standards at scale
  - Preventing drift
  - Learning across teams
  - Continuous improvement
```
