## Game Design Fundamentals

### The Core Loop

Every game has a core loop—the fundamental cycle players repeat:

```
ACTION → FEEDBACK → REWARD → MOTIVATION → ACTION

Example (Shooter):
Aim → Shoot → Hit/Miss feedback → Points/Progress → Aim again

Example (RPG):
Explore → Encounter → Combat → Loot/XP → Level up → Explore more
```

### The MDA Framework

```
MECHANICS    → DYNAMICS    → AESTHETICS
(Rules)         (Behavior)    (Emotion)

What you build → How it plays → What players feel

Design forward: Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics
Design backward: What feeling? → What behavior? → What rules?
```

### Player Motivation (Bartle Types)

```
ACHIEVERS   - Want to accomplish goals, collect, complete
EXPLORERS   - Want to discover, understand, map
SOCIALIZERS - Want to interact, cooperate, compete with others
KILLERS     - Want to dominate, defeat, impose will
```

---

## Mechanics Design

### Types of Mechanics

```
CORE MECHANICS:
What you do most often (shooting, jumping, building)

SECONDARY MECHANICS:
Support the core (inventory, upgrades, crafting)

PROGRESSION MECHANICS:
Drive forward motion (XP, unlocks, story beats)

SOCIAL MECHANICS:
Enable player interaction (trading, guilds, PvP)
```

### Balancing

```
THE BALANCE TRIANGLE:
       POWER
        /\
       /  \
      /    \
   COST ── UTILITY

Everything powerful should cost something.
Everything costly should provide utility.
Utility should feel worth the power/cost.
```

### Risk/Reward

```
LOW RISK  + LOW REWARD  = Boring
LOW RISK  + HIGH REWARD = Broken
HIGH RISK + LOW REWARD  = Frustrating
HIGH RISK + HIGH REWARD = Thrilling

Find the sweet spot for your game.
```

---

## Narrative Design

### Interactive Storytelling

```
LINEAR:
Player experiences fixed story
(The Last of Us)

BRANCHING:
Player choices affect story
(Detroit: Become Human)

EMERGENT:
Story arises from systems
(Dwarf Fortress, RimWorld)

ENVIRONMENTAL:
Story told through world
(Dark Souls, Hollow Knight)
```

### The Narrative Hook

```
MYSTERY    - What is happening?
THREAT     - What will happen?
DESIRE     - What could I get?
BELONGING  - Who are these people?
POWER      - What can I become?
```

### Ludonarrative Harmony

```
When mechanics and narrative align:
"I feel like a hero" + "My actions are heroic" = Harmony

When they conflict:
"I'm saving the world" + "I'm looting corpses" = Dissonance

Design mechanics that reinforce narrative.
Design narrative that justifies mechanics.
```

---

## Systems Programming

### Game Architecture Patterns

```
ENTITY-COMPONENT-SYSTEM (ECS):
Entities have components, systems process components
Best for: Data-oriented design, large worlds

OBJECT-ORIENTED:
Classes inherit behavior
Best for: Small to medium games, prototypes

STATE MACHINE:
States with transitions
Best for: AI, animation, game states
```

### Performance Considerations

```
UPDATE LOOP:
Fixed timestep for physics
Variable timestep for rendering
Interpolation for smoothness

MEMORY:
Object pooling for frequent spawns
Spatial partitioning for queries
Level of detail for distant objects

CPU:
Batch similar operations
Avoid per-frame allocations
Profile before optimizing
```

---

## Level Design

### The Level Design Pillars

```
NAVIGATION   - Can players find their way?
PACING       - Does difficulty/intensity vary?
AESTHETICS   - Does it look/feel right?
PURPOSE      - Does it serve the game's goals?
```

### Guiding Players

```
LANDMARKS    - Distinctive visual features
LIGHTING     - Bright = goal, dark = danger
ARCHITECTURE - Paths, walls, open spaces
COLOR        - Warm = safe, cool = threat
SOUND        - Music, ambient, directional cues
```

## Game Design Document (GDD) Template

```markdown
## Overview
- Game Title
- Genre
- Target Audience
- Platform(s)
- Core Fantasy (What the player should feel)

## Core Loop
- Primary action
- Feedback mechanism
- Reward structure
- Motivation driver

## Mechanics
- Core mechanics list
- Secondary mechanics
- Progression systems

## Narrative
- Setting
- Characters
- Story structure
- How story is delivered

## Art Direction
- Visual style
- Reference images
- Color palette

## Technical
- Engine/framework
- Key systems
- Performance targets
```

---

## Quick Reference

### Design Checklist

```
□ Core loop is clear and satisfying
□ Player motivations addressed
□ Mechanics reinforce fantasy
□ Narrative and mechanics align
□ Difficulty curve considered
□ Onboarding planned
□ End game considered
```

### Common Pitfalls

```
□ Scope creep - Start small, expand later
□ Feature bloat - Every feature should serve core loop
□ Poor feedback - Player needs to know what happened
□ Unclear goals - Player needs to know what to do
□ Punishment without learning - Failure should teach
```
