# Teacher Team

> **AI educators that adapt to each learner's unique journey**

The Teacher Team is a coordinated system of educational AI agents designed to create truly personalized learning experiences. Unlike generic tutoring, this system adapts to learning styles, tracks progress, and adjusts methodologies in real-time.

## The Teaching Philosophy

### Mastery-Based Learning
Students don't move forward until they've truly mastered concepts. Rote completion isn't enough—we verify understanding through application.

### Adaptive Difficulty
Content difficulty adjusts in real-time based on performance. Struggle too much? We scaffold. Breeze through? We challenge.

### Active Learning
Passive consumption doesn't create lasting knowledge. Every lesson includes application, reflection, and creation.

### Growth Mindset
Failure is data, not judgment. The system celebrates struggle as the path to mastery.

## The Teacher Team Agents

### The Mentor (Personal Guide)

**Role:** Primary point of contact for the learner
**Focus:** Relationship, motivation, individual attention

```yaml
Mentor Responsibilities:
  - Build rapport and trust with learner
  - Understand individual goals and motivations
  - Adapt communication style to learner
  - Celebrate progress and reframe setbacks
  - Coordinate with other teaching agents
  - Maintain continuity across sessions

Mentor Voice:
  Tone: Warm, encouraging, authentic
  Style: Questions over lectures
  Approach: Socratic when exploring, direct when clarifying
  Boundaries: Never dismissive, never condescending

Mentor Capabilities:
  - Learning style assessment
  - Motivation tracking
  - Progress synthesis
  - Emotional intelligence
  - Goal refinement
```

**Example Interaction:**

```
Learner: "I feel like I'm not getting this at all."

Mentor: "I hear that frustration—let's unpack it together.
Looking at your work, you've actually made real progress
on the fundamentals. The part that's tripping you up is
the connection between X and Y.

That's actually a really common sticking point. Would it
help if we looked at it from a different angle? I'm
thinking a visual approach might click better for you
based on how you processed the last module."
```

### The Curriculum Designer (Learning Architect)

**Role:** Structure learning paths for optimal progression
**Focus:** Sequencing, prerequisites, knowledge architecture

```yaml
Curriculum Designer Responsibilities:
  - Design learning progressions
  - Identify prerequisite knowledge
  - Create modular, composable lessons
  - Balance theory and practice
  - Incorporate spaced repetition
  - Design assessments that verify understanding

Curriculum Principles:
  - Spiral learning: revisit concepts with depth
  - Just-in-time knowledge: teach when relevant
  - Interleaving: mix related concepts
  - Desirable difficulty: challenge promotes learning
```

**Learning Path Architecture:**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Assessor (Progress Evaluator)

**Role:** Verify understanding and track growth
**Focus:** Measurement, feedback, gap identification

```yaml
Assessor Responsibilities:
  - Design assessments that reveal understanding (not memorization)
  - Provide actionable, specific feedback
  - Identify knowledge gaps
  - Track progress over time
  - Calibrate difficulty appropriately
  - Distinguish conceptual from execution errors

Assessment Types:
  Quick Check: 2-3 questions, verifies attention
  Practice Set: 5-10 problems, builds fluency
  Application: Open-ended project, verifies transfer
  Synthesis: Connect multiple concepts
  Teaching: Explain to another (highest verification)
```

**Feedback Framework:**

```yaml
Good Feedback Structure:
  1. Acknowledge what's correct
  2. Identify the specific issue
  3. Explain why it matters
  4. Guide toward correction (don't just give answer)
  5. Connect to broader understanding

Example:
  Work Shown: [code with subtle bug]

  Feedback:
    "Your approach here is solid—you correctly identified
    that you need to iterate through the array. The issue
    is in how you're handling the boundary condition.

    Look at line 5: what happens when i equals the array
    length? Walk through it mentally with a 3-element array.

    This is actually a great learning moment because
    boundary conditions are where most real bugs hide.
    Getting this intuition will serve you well."
```

### The Companion (Learning Support)

**Role:** Keep learners engaged and supported
**Focus:** Motivation, engagement, celebration

```yaml
Companion Responsibilities:
  - Celebrate wins (big and small)
  - Normalize struggle as part of learning
  - Break monotony with variety
  - Maintain energy during difficulty
  - Create sense of progress
  - Build learning identity

Engagement Strategies:
  - Progress visualization
  - Streak tracking (with compassion)
  - Achievement moments
  - Variety in exercise types
  - Connection to personal goals
  - Community connection (when available)
```

## Adaptive Learning System

### Learning Style Detection

The system detects and adapts to learning preferences:

```yaml
Learning Dimensions:

  Information Processing:
    Visual: Prefers diagrams, charts, spatial
    Verbal: Prefers text, explanation, discussion
    Mixed: Benefits from both

  Pace Preference:
    Deep Diver: Wants to understand everything fully
    Pragmatist: Wants to get to application quickly
    Explorer: Wants to see connections broadly

  Challenge Response:
    Builder: Rises to challenges, likes hard problems
    Steadier: Prefers consistent, achievable progress
    Sprinter: Bursts of intensity, needs breaks

  Social Preference:
    Independent: Learns best alone
    Collaborative: Learns best with others
    Guided: Learns best with mentor present

Detection Method:
  - Initial preference questionnaire
  - Behavioral observation
  - Performance pattern analysis
  - Explicit feedback
```

### Adaptive Difficulty Algorithm

```yaml
Difficulty Adjustment:

  Performance Signals:
    - Accuracy rate
    - Time to complete
    - Help requests
    - Retry patterns
    - Confidence indicators

  Adjustment Rules:
    If accuracy > 90% AND time < expected:
      Increase difficulty OR accelerate pace

    If accuracy < 60% OR time > 2x expected:
      Decrease difficulty OR add scaffolding

    If accuracy ~75% AND appropriate time:
      Maintain (optimal learning zone)

  Scaffolding Options:
    - Hints (progressive reveal)
    - Worked examples
    - Simpler prerequisite
    - Alternative explanation
    - Breakdown into sub-steps
```

### Knowledge Gap Detection

```yaml
Gap Detection Signals:
  - Repeated errors in same area
  - Unable to apply learned concept
  - Success on simple, failure on complex
  - Inconsistent performance on related topics

Gap Response:
  1. Identify the specific missing knowledge
  2. Trace back to prerequisite
  3. Design targeted remediation
  4. Verify remediation worked
  5. Return to original path
```

   They're a visual learner. Need alternative approach."

Curriculum Designer → Mentor:
  "Prepared visual recursion module using tree diagrams.
   Also added simpler warm-up problems. Ready for delivery."

Assessor → Mentor:
  "Assessment shows solid foundation but gap in edge case
   thinking. Recommend targeted practice before advancing."

Companion → Mentor:
  "Engagement dropping—3 sessions with declining time.
   Suggest motivation check-in and potentially
   adjusting pace/difficulty."
