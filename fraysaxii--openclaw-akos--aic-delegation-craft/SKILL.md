## When to use this skill

Read this before setting up the delegation workflow, dispatching subagents, or
recovering from a misread. Assumes you have read the paired rule, which defines
the two seats and the advisory non-goal (Cursor can't auto-switch the foreground
model).

## The two seats, in plain terms

| | Foreground thinking seat | Background execution seats |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Model class | Opus / thinking models | Composer-pinned subagents |
| Best at | judgment, scope, doctrine, messy input, irreversible calls | bounded mechanical work against a settled plan |
| The operator | talks to this seat first | rarely talks to directly; receives decomposed packets |
| Cost posture | expensive — use deliberately | cheap — parallelise freely |

The operator's deepest need: **stay messy in the thinking seat without guilt.**
Dump high-context, multi-topic, typo-heavy input to Opus; let it sort, decompose,
and dispatch. Do not make the operator pre-sort work into the "right" model.

## Principle — the seat frames, the operator decides

The thinking seat does **not** "own" the decision; it *frames* it and hands the
operator a clean choice with a recommended default. Judgment calls — which shape,
which trade-off, go / hold — are the **operator's**, surfaced as an inline-ratify
gate. Saying "let me switch to the thinking model to decide" is a category error:
the model *structures* the call; the human *makes* it. (Worked example: the
2026-05-29 entity-registry shape — the seat laid out three options + a
recommended default; the operator chose Option 1. The seat never needed to
"decide" anything; it needed to make the decision easy.)

## Pattern 1 — Opening prompts that signal the seat (no model names needed)

The operator should not have to remember model names. Teach these openers:

- *"Think with me about ..."* / *"Help me decide ..."* / *"Is this coherent ..."*
  → thinking seat (judgment).
- *"Go do ..."* / *"Apply ... across ..."* / *"Run the validators and fix ..."*
  → execution seat (mechanical), usually dispatched to subagents.

If an opener is ambiguous, the thinking seat asks one clarifying question rather
than guessing — cheaper than a misread.

## Pattern 2 — Decompose, then dispatch (the multitask shape)

The high-leverage workflow:

1. **One Opus chat** receives the messy input and decomposes it into bounded
   packets — each packet names files, validators, decision IDs, acceptance check.
2. **N Composer subagents** (Task tool, `run_in_background: true`) each take one
   packet and execute in parallel.
3. **The Opus chat** collects the results and renders the verdict / synthesis —
   the judgment layer the execution seats should not own.

Dispatch template (per subagent):

> "Execute packet K: edit `<paths>`; the change is `<precise spec>`; run
> `<validator>`; do NOT make judgment calls — if you hit an ambiguity or a
> validator FAIL, stop and report. Return: files changed + validator result."

The judgment ("is this the right change?") stays with the thinking seat; the
execution ("make exactly this change") goes to the subagents.

## Pattern 3 — Assign the seat in each workflow (Agent / Plan / Multitask)

The two-seat split is **operator-configurable in the UI + config**, not just an
advisory recommendation. (Verified 2026-05-29 against Cursor Plan Mode docs + the
3.2 `/multitask` changelog — this corrects an earlier draft that framed subagents
as the only lever.) Three workflows, three places to set the model:

### Agent mode — Custom Modes (save the setup once)

Cursor Custom Modes preselect a model + instructions. Save two:

- **Holistika Interpret** — Opus + "focus on judgment, scope, doctrine; decompose
  before delegating; surface decisions as inline-ratify gates." Pair with the
  research-action craft.
- **Holistika Execute** — Composer + "make precise, settled changes; run
  validators; stop and report on any ambiguity or FAIL." Pair with this rule.

Switch with the mode picker (or a keyboard shortcut) — a one-click seat change.

### Plan mode (`Shift+Tab`) — pick the planning model, then choose how to build

The **planning model** is the model selector in the chat input — set it to Opus
(or Codex) so judgment drives the plan. When the plan is ready you get two build
buttons:

- **Build Locally** — the foreground Agent (your picked execution model) runs it.
- **Build in parallel** — kicks off `/multitask` (the execution fleet).

The read-only *exploration* subagents Plan mode spawns to scout context have their
own model at **Settings → Subagents → Explore subagent model** (default is a cheap
model; leave it cheap). So the native pattern is literally: **Opus plans → build
on Composer.** No vibes required.

### `/multitask` — pin per-subagent models in `.cursor/agents/`

`/multitask` (Agents Window, Cursor 3.2+) runs an async fleet in worktrees. By
default subagents **inherit** the parent model; to pin a seat per role, create one
file per agent:

```
---
name: executor
description: Mechanical multi-file edits + validators against a settled packet.
model: composer-2.5          # inherit | fast | a slug that matches your picker
readonly: false
---
<instructions: make exactly the specified change; stop + report on collision/FAIL>
```

- `model:` accepts `inherit`, `fast`, or an exact picker slug (e.g.
  `claude-4.6-opus-high-thinking`, `composer-2.5`, `gpt-5.3-codex-xhigh`).
- **Caveat — verify it took:** in early `/multitask` the `model:` field was
  sometimes ignored and fell back to inherit (fix rolling in ~3.3). Check the
  request's model before trusting a per-seat pin on irreversible work.
- A read-only `planner` / `reviewer` agent (`readonly: true`) on a thinking model
  is the safe first one to add — it can't write, so it can't break anything.

## Pattern 4 — Statusline (know which seat you're in)

Configure the Cursor statusline via the **Cursor-bundled statusline skill** at
`~/.cursor/skills-cursor/statusline/SKILL.md` (a built-in skill, **not** a repo
skill) to show the active model + context-window %. Free, no tokens, persistent
visual cue. Keep the config on the operator's machine; never commit
machine-specific config or secrets.

## Pattern 5 — Misread recovery (the two-strike rule)

If an execution seat misreads intent twice in a row:

1. Stop dispatching to it for this task class.
2. Escalate the session to the thinking seat.
3. Treat it as a knowledge-test signal (per the People agentic doctrine): the
   misread means doctrine absorption degraded for this task class; the thinking
   seat re-establishes the packet spec, then may re-dispatch.

Two misreads is the trigger, not one — a single misread is noise; a pattern is
signal.

## Pattern 6 — Make governance gates legible at build time

A plan that contains an approval gate must make that gate the **explicit first
todo**, clearly labelled (e.g. "⛔ OPERATOR APPROVAL — canonical-CSV gate"), so
that pushing the build button never surprises the operator with an approval they
did not know they owed. A buried gate produces exactly the friction the operator
named on 2026-05-29 — *"I thought the plan was completely drafted and I wanted to
push the build button … maybe it's me that didn't see I had to approve
something."* That confusion is a workflow defect, not an operator error.

Two clean ways to clear a gate before building:

1. **Pre-clear in chat** — the operator says "go, <option>"; the thinking seat
   records the clearance in the durable ratification doc; the operator then
   pushes build with the execution model.
2. **Front-load it as todo #1** — the plan's first todo *is* the approval, so the
   build pauses there visibly rather than mid-stream.

The fix is never "add more gates." It is making the *one* real gate legible up
front, then handing the mechanical build to the execution seat with a
verify-first instruction. And remember: a fully drafted plan plus one cleared
gate **is** ready to build on the execution model — the gate is a checkpoint, not
a reason to keep the work on the thinking seat.

## Worked example — the 2026-05-29 regression (why the seats matter)

A Composer-authored rollout plan was structurally excellent but proposed to
"mint" a per-task registry, data model, and validator that **already existed**
(it trusted a stale roadmap's file list without checking repo reality). An Opus
pass caught the collision, reframed the phase, and fixed the upstream drift.

The lesson is exactly the seat split: the execution model nailed everything
answerable from the context it was handed, and missed the one thing requiring
independent verification of ground truth. Keep context-verification on the
thinking seat for canonical-CSV work. Recorded as a field-test data point in
[`field-test-note.md`](../../../docs/wip/intelligence/model-selection-2026-05-28/field-test-note.md).

## Anti-patterns

- **Dispatching un-decomposed intent.** Handing a messy brief straight to an
  execution subagent → it pattern-matches. Decompose first (Pattern 2).
- **Letting the execution seat make judgment calls.** Scope, doctrine, and
  irreversible decisions are the thinking seat's job.
- **Claiming auto-switching.** Cursor can't switch the foreground model; this is
  advisory + Custom Modes only.
- **Over-routing trivial work to Opus.** A one-line CSV fix does not need the
  thinking seat — that wastes budget. Reserve Opus for genuine judgment.
- **Single-misread overreaction.** Escalate on a *pattern* (two strikes), not on
  one slip.
