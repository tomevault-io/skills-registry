# Code Reviewer Skill

Review code changes for quality, security, and performance. Provide structured, actionable feedback.

## Activation Triggers

- After completing a feature, bug fix, or refactoring (automatic)
- "review this code" (manual)
- Before PR creation

## Review Areas

1. **Correctness**: Logic, bugs, edge cases, boundary values
2. **Quality**: Language idioms, DRY, early return, duplication (per CLAUDE.md)
3. **Type Safety**: Type annotations, null/undefined, off-by-one
4. **Performance**: Unnecessary allocations, parallelization opportunities, data structure choice
5. **Security**: Input validation, SQLi/XSS, secrets handling
6. **Testing**: Coverage for new code paths, edge case tests
7. **Project Compliance**: CLAUDE.md standards, consistency with existing patterns

## Workflow

1. **Context**: `git diff` to understand changes, check project CLAUDE.md, identify related tests
2. **Analysis**: Review against above areas. Run `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` for lint/type errors
3. **Test Verification**: Check coverage and test quality
4. **Feedback**: Report using the format below

## Output Format

1. **Critical Issues** (must fix): Bugs, vulnerabilities, breaking changes → file:line + fix suggestion
2. **Important Suggestions** (should address): Performance, maintainability
3. **Minor Improvements** (nice to have): Style, documentation
4. **Positive Highlights**: Good implementations
5. **Next Steps**: Prioritized recommended actions

Template details: `templates/review-report.md`

## Decision Criteria

- Correctness > cleverness. CLAUDE.md standards > general best practices
- Provide specific, actionable feedback (file:line + code examples)
- Investigate why unusual approaches pass tests before flagging them
