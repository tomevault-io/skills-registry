# Knowledge Manager Skill

Manage a structured knowledge base. Progressive disclosure: reference knowledge only when relevant, keeping CLAUDE.md minimal.

## Activation Triggers

- Discovered a reusable solution (automatic)
- Solved a non-obvious technical problem (automatic)
- Established a new coding convention or pattern (automatic)

## Categories

| Category | Path | When to Record |
|----------|------|---------------|
| Patterns | `knowledge/patterns/` | Reusable design patterns, architecture |
| Troubleshooting | `knowledge/troubleshooting/` | Non-obvious technical problem solutions |
| Best Practices | `knowledge/best-practices/` | Coding standards, quality guidelines |
| Workflows | `knowledge/workflows/` | Dev processes, CI/CD, operational procedures |

## Recording Process

1. **Detect**: Identify valuable insights during development
2. **Evaluate**: Assess on 3 axes — Reusability, Impact, Learning Value (record if 2/3 are Medium+)
3. **Record**: Check category INDEX.md → deduplicate → create with template (`templates/`) → update INDEX.md
4. **User Approval**: Present summary, category, evaluation, and usage examples; create only after approval

## Search and Retrieval

1. Check relevant category INDEX.md
2. Read only the specific files needed
3. Provide answers with source references

## Maintenance

- Periodically update INDEX files, archive low-value entries, consolidate duplicates
