# Architecture Skills

## Overview

This module covers fundamental and advanced architecture concepts
applicable across all technology stacks.

## Categories

### Principles
Core software design principles that guide architectural decisions.
- SOLID Principles
- DRY, KISS, YAGNI
- Separation of Concerns
- Dependency Inversion

### Patterns
High-level architecture patterns for organizing systems.
- Clean Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Layered Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design
- CQRS & Event Sourcing
- Microservices

### Design Patterns
Reusable solutions to common design problems.
- Creational: Factory, Builder, Singleton, DI
- Structural: Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Repository
- Behavioral: Strategy, Observer, Command, State Machine

### Distributed Systems
Patterns for building distributed applications.
- Service Communication
- Data Consistency
- Resilience Patterns
- Event-Driven Architecture

### Decision Making
Tools and frameworks for architectural decisions.
- Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
- Trade-off Analysis
- Documentation Best Practices

## When to Use

- Starting new projects
- Refactoring legacy systems
- Making architecture decisions
- Code review and design discussions
- Team knowledge sharing
