# AI Orchestration Patterns

## When to use
- Designing agent flows, tool calling, or multi-step reasoning.
- Adding fallbacks, routing, or safety checks for LLM behavior.
- Improving observability and determinism of agent outcomes.

## Core guidance
- Separate decisioning from execution (planner vs. tool runner).
- Prefer explicit tool schemas and clear system instructions.
- Add guardrails: timeouts, max steps, and safe fallbacks.
- Log decisions with enough context for debugging.

## Do
- Keep tool routing in services (not endpoints).
- Define tool schemas close to the agent logic in `src/services/`.
- Add conservative fallbacks when tool support is missing.

## Don't
- Let LLMs call tools without validation of arguments.
- Mix orchestration logic into `src/endpoints/`.
- Skip logging of tool calls, queries, and chosen paths.

## Anti-patterns seen
- Hidden state in scratchpads without logging.
- Tool selection coupled to provider-specific formats.
- Unlimited loops without `max_steps` or timeouts.

## Repo anchors
- `src/services/agent_service.py`
- `src/services/rag_service.py`
- `src/services/context_builder.py`
