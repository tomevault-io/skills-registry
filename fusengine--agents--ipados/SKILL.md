# iPadOS Platform

iPadOS-specific development for tablet and productivity experiences.

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY implementation, use `TeamCreate` to spawn 3 agents:

1. **fuse-ai-pilot:explore-codebase** - Analyze existing iPad patterns
2. **fuse-ai-pilot:research-expert** - Verify latest iPadOS 26 docs via Context7/Exa
3. **mcp__apple-docs__search_apple_docs** - Check iPad multitasking patterns

After implementation, run **fuse-ai-pilot:sniper** for validation.
