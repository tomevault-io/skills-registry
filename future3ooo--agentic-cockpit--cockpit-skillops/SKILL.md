# Cockpit SkillOps

## When to use
- After completing a meaningful task or slice.
- Before reporting final `outcome="done"` for autopilot tasks that require SkillOps evidence.

## Required sequence
1. `node scripts/skillops.mjs debrief --skills <skill-a,skill-b> --title "What changed"`
   Fast path when the learning is already clear:
   `node scripts/skillops.mjs debrief --skills <skill-a,skill-b> --skill-update "skill-a:1-line rule" --title "What changed"`
2. `node scripts/skillops.mjs distill`
3. `node scripts/skillops.mjs lint`

## Evidence contract
- Include all three commands in `testsToRun`.
- Include the debrief log markdown path in `artifacts` (under `.codex/skill-ops/logs/...`).
- `distill` is non-durable. Do not claim it patched durable skill files.
- Raw SkillOps logs are local evidence only.
- `queued` logs are non-blocking runtime evidence, not removable dirt; runtime retires them only after processed mark-back succeeds.
- Do not pretend a learned heuristic is durable until runtime either:
  - retires the empty log locally, or
  - queues the dedicated `skillops-promotion` lane and later promotes the heuristic on the promotion PR branch.
