# CodeRabbit Feedback Resolver

Process and resolve CodeRabbit's automated PR review comments systematically.

## PR Comments Prohibition (CRITICAL)

**NEVER leave new comments directly on GitHub PRs.** This is strictly forbidden:

- `gh pr review --comment` - FORBIDDEN
- `gh pr comment` - FORBIDDEN
- Any GraphQL mutation that creates new reviews or PR-level comments - FORBIDDEN

**Permitted operations:**
- Reply to EXISTING CodeRabbit threads using `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply`
- Resolve CodeRabbit threads using `resolveReviewThread`

## WHEN TO USE THIS SKILL

**USE THIS SKILL PROACTIVELY** when ANY of the following occur:

- User says "check rabbit review" / "handle coderabbit comments" / "resolve rabbit feedback"
- User mentions "coderabbit" or "rabbit" and "PR" or "comments" in the same context
- After PR creation when CodeRabbit has reviewed the PR
- As part of the PR workflow after `pr-reviewer` skill completes
- When PR checks show CodeRabbit has left review comments

## CodeRabbit Comment Structure

CodeRabbit comments follow a structured markdown format:

```
_🧹 Nitpick_ | _🔵 Trivial_    <- Severity indicator (optional)

[Main feedback text]

<details>
<summary>💡 Optional suggestion</summary>
[Expanded suggestion content]
</details>

<details>
<summary>📝 Committable suggestion</summary>
[Code block with suggested changes]
</details>

<details>
<summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>
[Explicit instructions for AI to follow]
</details>
```

**Key elements to extract:**
- **Severity**: `_🧹 Nitpick_` or `_🔵 Trivial_` = auto-resolvable
- **Prompt for AI Agents**: Explicit instructions - USE THESE DIRECTLY
- **Committable suggestion**: Ready-to-apply code changes

## Prerequisites

**CRITICAL: Load the `fx-dev:github` skill FIRST** before running any GitHub API operations. This skill provides essential patterns and error handling for `gh` CLI commands.

## Core Workflow

### 0. Verify CodeRabbit Configuration (First Run Only)

**Before processing feedback, ensure CodeRabbit is configured to read `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.**

CodeRabbit's `knowledge_base.code_guidelines` feature reads instruction files to understand project conventions. By default, it includes `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, but this may be disabled or overridden.

#### Check Configuration

```bash
# Check if .coderabbit.yaml exists
if [ -f ".coderabbit.yaml" ]; then
  cat .coderabbit.yaml
else
  echo "No .coderabbit.yaml found - using defaults"
fi
```

#### Configuration States

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| No `.coderabbit.yaml` exists | Defaults apply - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` IS read automatically |
| Config exists with `knowledge_base.code_guidelines.enabled: false` | **Update** to `enabled: true` |
| Config exists with custom `filePatterns` missing copilot-instructions.md | **Add** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to `filePatterns` |
| Config exists with defaults or explicit copilot-instructions.md | No action needed |

#### Create/Update Configuration

If configuration needs updating, create or modify `.coderabbit.yaml`:

```yaml
# .coderabbit.yaml
# Ensures CodeRabbit reads project conventions from copilot-instructions.md

knowledge_base:
  code_guidelines:
    enabled: true
    # Default patterns include .github/copilot-instructions.md
    # Add explicit pattern if using custom filePatterns:
    # filePatterns:
    #   - .github/copilot-instructions.md
    #   - CLAUDE.md
```

**Minimal config to ensure copilot-instructions.md is read:**

```yaml
knowledge_base:
  code_guidelines:
    enabled: true
```

This enables the default file patterns which include `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

#### When to Update copilot-instructions.md

If CodeRabbit feedback conflicts with project conventions (INCORRECT category), update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with the correct pattern. Since CodeRabbit reads this file, future reviews will respect the documented conventions.

### 1. Fetch Unresolved CodeRabbit Threads

Query review threads using GraphQL.

**IMPORTANT:** Use inline values, NOT `$variable` syntax. The `$` character causes shell escaping issues (`Expected VAR_SIGN, actual: UNKNOWN_CHAR`).

```bash
# Replace OWNER, REPO, PR_NUMBER with actual values
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          path
          line
          comments(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              author { login }
              body
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

**Filter for:** `isResolved: false` AND author login contains `coderabbitai`

### 2. Categorize Each Comment

For each unresolved CodeRabbit comment:

| Category | Indicator | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Nitpick/Trivial** | Contains `_🧹 Nitpick_` or `_🔵 Trivial_` | Auto-resolve immediately |
| **Actionable with AI Prompt** | Has `🤖 Prompt for AI Agents` section | Extract prompt, delegate to coder |
| **Actionable with Committable** | Has `📝 Committable suggestion` | Apply suggestion directly |
| **General Feedback** | No special sections | Analyze and delegate to coder |
| **Deferred** | Valid but out of scope for this PR | Track in PROJECT.md, reply, resolve |

### 3. Process Each Category

#### Nitpicks/Trivial
- Resolve immediately without changes
- These are suggestions, not requirements

#### Actionable with AI Prompt (PREFERRED)

**When a comment contains `🤖 Prompt for AI Agents`, extract and use it directly:**

1. Parse the comment body to extract content between `<summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>` and the closing `</details>`
2. The extracted text contains explicit instructions - pass these to the coder sub-agent verbatim
3. After fix is implemented, resolve the thread

Example extraction:
```
In src/lib/view-config.ts around lines 115 to 118, expand the JSDoc above
NUMERIC_OPERATORS to explicitly state that operators in this set expect numeric
values...
```

#### Actionable with Committable Suggestion

1. Extract the code block from `📝 Committable suggestion` section
2. Apply the suggested changes directly using Edit tool
3. Commit with message referencing the CodeRabbit suggestion
4. Resolve the thread

#### General Feedback

1. Read the feedback carefully
2. Determine if it's valid or conflicts with project conventions
3. If valid: Delegate to coder sub-agent with context
4. If conflicts with project conventions (INCORRECT):
   - Reply with explanation and resolve
   - **Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** to document the correct pattern
   - This prevents both Copilot AND CodeRabbit from flagging it again (CodeRabbit reads this file via `knowledge_base.code_guidelines`)

#### Deferred (Out of Scope)

**When feedback is valid but out of scope for the current PR:**

1. **Load the `fx-dev:project-management` skill** to track the follow-up work
2. **Add task to PROJECT.md** under the appropriate feature/section:
   - Read current PROJECT.md structure
   - Add a concise task describing the improvement
   - Commit the PROJECT.md update
3. **Reply to the thread** explaining the deferral:
   - "Valid suggestion. Tracked as follow-up task in PROJECT.md for a future PR."
4. **Resolve the thread**

**CRITICAL:** Never defer feedback without tracking it. "Acknowledged for follow-up" without a PROJECT.md entry is INCOMPLETE WORK.

### 4. Resolve Threads

Use GraphQL mutation to resolve each processed thread.

**IMPORTANT:** Use inline values, NOT `$variable` syntax.

```bash
# Replace THREAD_ID with actual thread ID (e.g., PRRT_kwDONZ...)
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "THREAD_ID"}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}'
```

### 5. Reply to Threads (When Needed)

For feedback that conflicts with conventions or is being declined.

**IMPORTANT:** Use inline values, NOT `$variable` syntax.

```bash
# Replace THREAD_ID and message with actual values
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: "PRRT_xxx",
    body: "Your explanation here"
  }) {
    comment { id }
  }
}'
```

## Parsing Helper

To extract the AI prompt from a CodeRabbit comment:

```bash
# Extract content between 🤖 Prompt for AI Agents and </details>
echo "$COMMENT_BODY" | sed -n '/🤖 Prompt for AI Agents/,/<\/details>/p' | sed '1d;$d' | sed 's/^```$//'
```

## Success Criteria

**Task is INCOMPLETE until ALL of these are done:**

1. CodeRabbit config verified/updated to read `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. All code changes pushed to the PR branch
3. **EVERY addressed thread resolved via GraphQL mutation**
4. **For INCORRECT feedback:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` updated to prevent recurrence
5. **For DEFERRED feedback:** Task added to `docs/PROJECT.md` via project-management skill
6. Re-query confirms `isResolved: true` for all processed threads
7. Output summary table

### Required Output: Thread Summary Table

```
| Thread ID | File:Line | Category | Action Taken | Status |
|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------|--------|
| PRRT_xxx  | src/foo.ts:42 | Nitpick | Auto-resolved | ✅ Resolved |
| PRRT_yyy  | src/bar.ts:15 | AI Prompt | Applied JSDoc fix | ✅ Resolved |
| PRRT_zzz  | lib/util.js:8 | Committable | Applied suggestion | ✅ Resolved |
| PRRT_aaa  | src/ui.tsx:20 | Deferred | Tracked in PROJECT.md | ✅ Resolved |
```

## Error Handling

- API failures: Retry with proper auth
- Thread ID issues: Use alternative queries
- Parse failures for AI prompt: Fall back to manual analysis
- Partial resolution is better than none
