# Resolve PR Feedback

Meta-skill that checks a PR for unresolved automated review feedback and invokes the appropriate resolver skills.

## WHEN TO USE THIS SKILL

**USE THIS SKILL** when ANY of the following occur:

- User says "resolve PR feedback" / "check PR comments" / "address review comments"
- User wants to handle all automated review feedback on a PR
- After PR creation to ensure all automated reviewers are addressed
- As part of the SDLC workflow before finalizing a PR

## Supported Reviewers

| Reviewer | Author Pattern | Resolver Skill |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| GitHub Copilot | `Copilot` | `fx-dev:copilot-feedback-resolver` |
| CodeRabbit | `coderabbitai[bot]` | `fx-dev:rabbit-feedback-resolver` |
| Codecov | `codecov[bot]` / `codecov-commenter` | `fx-dev:resolve-codecov-feedback` |

## Prerequisites

**CRITICAL: Load the `fx-dev:github` skill FIRST** before running any GitHub API operations.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Determine PR Number

If not provided, get from current branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json number -q '.number'
```

### 2. Query All Unresolved Review Threads

**IMPORTANT:** Use inline values, NOT `$variable` syntax. The `$` character causes shell escaping issues.

```bash
# Replace OWNER, REPO, PR_NUMBER with actual values
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes {
              author { login }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

### 3. Identify Unresolved Feedback by Source

Parse the response and categorize unresolved threads by author:

- **Copilot threads**: author login is `Copilot`
- **CodeRabbit threads**: author login contains `coderabbitai`

### 3b. Check for Codecov Coverage Feedback

Codecov uses PR comments and commit statuses, NOT review threads. Query separately:

```bash
# Check for Codecov commit statuses
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')
gh api "/repos/OWNER/REPO/commits/$HEAD_SHA/statuses" \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.context | startswith("codecov/"))] | {count: length, statuses: [.[] | {context, state, description}]}'

# Check for Codecov PR comments
gh api "/repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/PR_NUMBER/comments" \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == "codecov[bot]" or .user.login == "codecov-commenter")] | length'
```

Codecov feedback exists if:
- Any `codecov/*` commit status has state `failure` or `error`
- OR Codecov PR comment indicates patch coverage below threshold

### 4. Invoke Appropriate Resolver Skills

**If Copilot threads exist:**
```
Skill tool: skill="fx-dev:copilot-feedback-resolver"
```

**If CodeRabbit threads exist:**
```
Skill tool: skill="fx-dev:rabbit-feedback-resolver"
```

**If Codecov coverage gaps detected:**
```
Skill tool: skill="fx-dev:resolve-codecov-feedback"
```

**If multiple exist:** Invoke sequentially (Copilot first, then CodeRabbit, then Codecov).

### 5. Verify All Resolved

After invoking resolver skills, re-query to confirm all threads are resolved:

```bash
# Replace OWNER, REPO, PR_NUMBER with actual values
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes {
              author { login }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' | jq '[.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false)] | length'
```

If unresolved threads remain, report which reviewers still have open feedback.

## Output Format

```
## PR #123 Feedback Summary

### Detection
- Copilot: 2 unresolved threads found
- CodeRabbit: 3 unresolved threads found
- Codecov: patch coverage 65% (below threshold)

### Resolution
- Invoked fx-dev:copilot-feedback-resolver
- Invoked fx-dev:rabbit-feedback-resolver
- Invoked fx-dev:resolve-codecov-feedback

### Final Status
- All automated review threads resolved
- Coverage improved to 85%
```

## Success Criteria

1. All unresolved automated review threads identified
2. Appropriate resolver skill(s) invoked
3. Final verification confirms all threads resolved
4. Summary output provided

## Error Handling

- If no PR found: Ask user for PR number
- If resolver skill fails: Report which reviewer's feedback remains unresolved
- If API errors: Retry with proper auth context
