# Research Phase

You are in the **research phase** of an agtx-managed task. This is a read-only exploration.

## Input

The argument to this command is a task ID. Fetch the task description using the agtx MCP tool:
```
mcp__agtx__get_task(task_id: "<the id passed to this command>")
```
Use the `description` field as the task to work on.

## Instructions

1. Fetch the task description via `get_task`
2. Explore the codebase to find relevant files, patterns, and architecture
3. Identify dependencies, related code, and potential complexity
4. Assess feasibility and estimate scope

## Output

Write your findings to `.agtx/research.md`. Include:

## Relevant Files
Key files and their roles — what exists, what needs changing.

## Architecture
How the relevant parts of the codebase fit together.

## Complexity
Assessment of scope — simple change, moderate refactor, or major undertaking.

## Open Questions
Things that need clarification before planning can begin.

## CRITICAL: Do Not Modify Code

This is a **read-only** exploration:
- Do NOT modify any source files
- Do NOT create branches or worktrees
- Do NOT start planning or implementing
- Say: "Research complete. Findings written to .agtx/research.md."
- Wait for further instructions

## Output Style

Terse. No pleasantries. Fragments OK. Short synonyms. Code exact.
Status updates: one line. Pattern: [what] [why]. Done.
