# Complexity Assessment

Evaluate task complexity before planning to ensure appropriate workflow depth and artifact structure.

## Contextd Integration

If contextd MCP is available:
- `memory_search` to find similar past assessments
- `memory_record` for tier recommendations with rationale
- `memory_outcome` to track assessment accuracy over time
- `branch_create/return` for isolated assessment

If contextd is NOT available:
- Assessment runs inline (still works)
- No persistence of tier decisions
- No historical comparison available

## When to Use

This skill is called by `/brainstorm` Phase 2 to determine:
- Question depth (SIMPLE: 3-5, STANDARD: 8-12, COMPLEX: 15+)
- GitHub artifact structure (single issue vs epic + sub-issues vs project board)
- Worktree recommendation
- Context branch budget allocation

---

## 7 Dimensions

Assess each dimension and aggregate to determine tier:

### 1. Scope
**Question:** How many files will be touched?

| Files | Score | Indicator |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1-2 | 1 | Single component, localized change |
| 3-10 | 2 | Multiple components, cross-cutting |
| 10+ | 3 | System-wide, architectural change |

### 2. Integration
**Question:** What external dependencies are involved?

| Dependencies | Score | Indicator |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| None | 1 | Self-contained, no external calls |
| 1-2 APIs/services | 2 | Moderate integration work |
| 3+ APIs/services | 3 | Complex orchestration required |

### 3. Infrastructure
**Question:** Are config/infra changes required?

| Changes | Score | Indicator |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| None | 1 | Code-only change |
| Config files | 2 | Environment variables, feature flags |
| New infra | 3 | Database, Docker, cloud resources |

### 4. Knowledge
**Question:** What domain expertise is required?

| Expertise | Score | Indicator |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Familiar patterns | 1 | Standard CRUD, common patterns |
| Some research | 2 | New library, unfamiliar domain |
| Deep expertise | 3 | Security, performance, compliance |

### 5. Risk
**Question:** What's the blast radius if something goes wrong?

| Risk | Score | Indicator |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Low | 1 | Easily reversible, non-critical path |
| Medium | 2 | User-facing, requires testing |
| High | 3 | Data integrity, security, payments |

### 6. Testing (New)
**Question:** What testing effort is required?

| Testing | Score | Indicator |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Minimal | 1 | Unit tests only, existing patterns |
| Moderate | 2 | Integration tests, new test fixtures |
| Extensive | 3 | E2E tests, performance tests, security audits |

### 7. Decomposability (New)
**Question:** Can this task be split into independent units?

| Decomposability | Score | Indicator |
|-----------------|-------|-----------|
| Easily decomposable | 1 | Clear subtasks, no shared state |
| Partially decomposable | 2 | Some dependencies between subtasks |
| Monolithic | 3 | Tightly coupled, must be done together |

---

## Risk Multipliers

Apply these multipliers to the base score when present:

| Factor | Multiplier | When to Apply |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Security-sensitive | 1.2x | Auth, encryption, user data, API keys |
| Data migration | 1.3x | Schema changes, data transformations |
| Breaking changes | 1.2x | API changes, deprecated features |
| Technical debt | 1.1x | Working in legacy/poorly-tested code |
| Time pressure | 1.1x | Urgent deadline, reduced review time |

**Calculation:** `adjusted_score = base_score * highest_applicable_multiplier`

---

## Confidence Scoring

Every assessment includes a confidence percentage (0-100%):

| Confidence | Range | Criteria |
|------------|-------|----------|
| High | 80-100% | Clear requirements, familiar domain, similar past tasks |
| Medium | 50-79% | Some ambiguity, partial familiarity |
| Low | 0-49% | Unclear scope, unfamiliar domain, novel problem |

**When confidence < 60%:** Use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify ambiguous dimensions before finalizing tier.

**Confidence factors:**
- Requirements clarity (+/- 20%)
- Domain familiarity (+/- 15%)
- Historical data available (+/- 15%)
- Codebase familiarity (+/- 10%)

---

## Team Velocity Factors

Adjust expectations based on team context:

| Factor | Impact | Consideration |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Team size | +/- 1 tier | Solo dev may need COMPLEX timeline adjustment |
| Experience level | +/- 1 dimension score | Junior devs add +1 to Knowledge dimension |
| Codebase familiarity | +/- 1 dimension score | New team members add +1 to Scope |
| Concurrent priorities | +/- 1 tier | High WIP may require elevated treatment |

---

## Tier Calculation

Sum scores across all 7 dimensions (max 21):

| Total Score | Tier | Characteristics |
|-------------|------|-----------------|
| 7-11 | SIMPLE | Quick change, minimal planning needed |
| 12-16 | STANDARD | Moderate complexity, structured approach |
| 17-21 | COMPLEX | High complexity, extensive planning required |

**After multipliers:** Round to nearest integer before tier assignment.

---

## Structured Output

Return assessment as JSON for downstream consumption:

```json
{
  "tier": "STANDARD",
  "confidence": 75,
  "confidence_justification": "Clear scope but unfamiliar OAuth library",
  "base_score": 14,

    "all": false
  },
  "intent_confirmation": {
    "required": true,
    "mode": "STANDARD"
  }
}
```

---

## Tier Implications

### SIMPLE (7-11)
- **Questions:** 3-5 quick clarifications
- **GitHub:** Single Issue with checklist
- **Worktree:** Optional, can work in main
- **Review:** Standard consensus review
- **Context branch budget:** 4096 tokens
- **Testing:** Unit tests, 70%+ coverage on new code

### STANDARD (12-16)
- **Questions:** 8-12 detailed questions
- **GitHub:** Epic Issue + sub-Issues
- **Worktree:** Recommended for isolation
- **Review:** Full consensus review
- **Context branch budget:** 8192 tokens
- **Testing:** Unit + integration tests, 80%+ coverage

### COMPLEX (17-21)
- **Questions:** 15+ comprehensive questions
- **GitHub:** Epic + sub-Issues + Project board
- **Worktree:** Required for isolation
- **Review:** Full consensus + additional scrutiny
- **Context branch budget:** 16384 tokens
- **Testing:** Unit + integration + E2E, 90%+ coverage, security audit

---

## Intent Confirmation Gating

After tier determination, include an `intent_confirmation` field in the output to signal the **caller** whether intent confirmation is recommended:

| Tier | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| SIMPLE (7-11) | `"intent_confirmation": "none"` - Caller should auto-proceed. |
| STANDARD (12-16) | `"intent_confirmation": "standard"` - Caller should invoke intent-confirmation skill. |
| COMPLEX (17-21) | `"intent_confirmation": "detailed"` - Caller should invoke intent-confirmation skill in DETAILED mode. |

### Integration Note

**This skill does NOT invoke intent-confirmation itself.** It outputs a recommendation that the calling workflow uses to decide whether to invoke intent-confirmation. The typical workflow is:

```
Caller (e.g., /brainstorm, /plan):
  1. Invoke complexity-assessment → returns tier + intent_confirmation field
  2. If intent_confirmation != "none":
     → Invoke intent-confirmation skill with the recommended mode
     → Wait for user confirmation
  3. Proceed with execution
```

This avoids a circular dependency between the two skills.

### DETAILED Mode (COMPLEX only)

For COMPLEX tasks, the intent preview includes:
- Full decomposition plan with subtask dependencies
- Risk factors and mitigation strategy
- Estimated resource usage (agents, branches, tokens)
- Explicit list of files to be modified
- User must respond with explicit "Yes" (not just acknowledgment)

### Why Gate on Complexity?

- SIMPLE tasks should not slow down developer flow with unnecessary confirmation
- STANDARD tasks benefit from a pause to ensure alignment
- COMPLEX tasks require explicit buy-in because rollback cost is high
- Research (JetBrains NeurIPS 2025) shows observation masking is 52% cheaper than full summarization; confirming intent early avoids wasted work on misunderstood requirements

---

## Review Agent Selection

Include a `recommended_agents` field in the structured output based on the assessment. This allows the consensus-review skill to perform adaptive agent selection without re-analyzing the diff.

### Output Field

```json
{
  "recommended_agents": {
    "always": ["code-quality-reviewer"],
    "if_go": ["go-reviewer"],
    "if_security_sensitive": ["security-reviewer", "vulnerability-reviewer"],
    "if_api_change": ["user-persona-reviewer", "documentation-reviewer"],
    "all": false
  }
}
```

### Selection Logic

| Tier | `all` | Base Agents |
|------|-------|-------------|
| SIMPLE | `false` | `["code-quality-reviewer"]` |
| STANDARD | `false` | `["code-quality-reviewer"]` + conditional agents |
| COMPLEX | `true` | All 6 reviewers (overrides conditional logic) |

### Conditional Agent Triggers

These are derived from the dimension scores:

| Condition | Trigger | Agents Added |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Risk score >= 2 | Security-sensitive | `security-reviewer`, `vulnerability-reviewer` |
| Knowledge score >= 2 AND domain is Go | Go code | `go-reviewer` |
| Integration score >= 2 | API changes likely | `user-persona-reviewer`, `documentation-reviewer` |
| Infrastructure score >= 2 | Config/infra changes | `security-reviewer` |
| Scope score == 3 | System-wide change | All reviewers (`all: true`) |

### Integration with consensus-review

The consensus-review skill reads `recommended_agents` from the assessment output:

```
1. Run complexity-assessment → get tier + recommended_agents
2. Pass recommended_agents to consensus-review adaptive agent selection
3. Consensus-review merges recommended_agents with its own override rules
4. Final agent set = union(recommended_agents, override_agents)
```

---

## Integration with Other Skills

### github-planning Integration
Tier determines GitHub artifact structure:

| Tier | Artifact Type | Details |
|------|---------------|---------|
| SIMPLE | Single Issue | Checklist in body, no sub-issues |
| STANDARD | Epic + Sub-Issues | Parent issue links children |
| COMPLEX | Epic + Sub-Issues + Project | Board with columns, milestones |

### context-folding Integration
Tier determines branch budget:

| Tier | Token Budget | Max Depth |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| SIMPLE | 4096 | 1 level |
| STANDARD | 8192 | 2 levels |
| COMPLEX | 16384 | 3 levels |

---

## Decomposition Suggestions

For COMPLEX tasks (score 17+), provide decomposition suggestions:

```json
{
  "decomposition_suggestions": [
    {
      "subtask": "Backend OAuth integration",
      "estimated_tier": "STANDARD",
      "dependencies": [],
      "can_parallelize": true
    },
    {
      "subtask": "Frontend auth UI components",
      "estimated_tier": "SIMPLE",
      "dependencies": [],
      "can_parallelize": true
    },
    {
      "subtask": "Session management middleware",
      "estimated_tier": "SIMPLE",
      "dependencies": ["Backend OAuth integration"],
      "can_parallelize": false
    }
  ],
  "parallelization_potential": "2 of 3 subtasks can run in parallel",
  "recommended_approach": "Split into 3 issues, assign backend and frontend in parallel"
}
```

---

## Ambiguity Handling

When confidence < 60%, use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "I'm uncertain about the complexity of this task. To provide an accurate assessment, I need clarification on:",
  options: [
    "What external services/APIs will this integrate with?",
    "Are there existing tests I should reference for patterns?",
    "What's the expected timeline pressure?",
    "Are there schema/database changes involved?"
  ],
  allow_custom: true
)
```

**After clarification:** Re-score affected dimensions and recalculate tier.

---

## Historical Comparison

When contextd is available, search for similar past assessments:

```
# Search for similar tasks
mcp__contextd__memory_search(
  project_id: "<project>",
  query: "<task description keywords>",
  tags: ["complexity-assessment"]
)
```

Include in output:
- Similar past tasks and their actual outcomes
- Iteration count (how many rounds to complete)
- Assessment accuracy (predicted vs actual complexity)

**Example output:**
```
Historical comparison: "Similar OAuth task (Issue #45) was assessed as STANDARD,
took 3 iterations to complete. Assessment was accurate."
```

---

## Contextd Recording

Store assessment in contextd with full rationale:

```
mcp__contextd__memory_record(
  project_id: "<project>",
  title: "Complexity assessment: <task-summary>",
  content: JSON.stringify({
    tier: "<tier>",
    confidence: <0-100>,
    base_score: <sum>,
    adjusted_score: <after multipliers>,
    dimensions: { <all 7 with scores and rationale> },
    multipliers: [<applied multipliers>],
    decomposition: <suggestions if COMPLEX>,
    integration_hints: { <github, context-folding settings> }
  }),
  outcome: "success",
  tags: ["complexity-assessment", "<tier>", "confidence-<high|medium|low>"]
)
```

---

## Example Assessment

**Task:** "Add user authentication with OAuth2"

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Scope | 2 | Auth routes, middleware, user model, frontend components |
| Integration | 2 | OAuth provider API integration |
| Infrastructure | 2 | Environment variables, session config |
| Knowledge | 2 | OAuth2 flow, security best practices |
| Risk | 3 | Security-critical, user data |
| Testing | 2 | Integration tests for OAuth flow needed |
| Decomposability | 1 | Backend/frontend can be parallelized |

**Base Score:** 14/21
**Multiplier:** 1.2x (security-sensitive)
**Adjusted Score:** 16.8 -> 17 = **COMPLEX** (borderline)
**Confidence:** 75% (clear scope, unfamiliar library)

## Red Flags - STOP and Reconsider

If you're thinking any of these, you're about to violate the skill:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is obviously simple, no need to score" | Score anyway. Intuition misses edge cases. |
| "I'll just say STANDARD to be safe" | Calculate the actual score. Don't guess. |
| "Recording to contextd is optional" | Recording is MANDATORY. No exceptions. |
| "Risk doesn't matter for this task" | Risk ALWAYS matters. Score it. |
| "I can skip dimensions for simple tasks" | ALL 7 dimensions. Every time. |
| "The user already knows the complexity" | Document for future sessions. Record it. |
| "Confidence scoring is extra work" | Confidence enables better decisions. Calculate it. |
| "Decomposition is only for COMPLEX" | Consider it for STANDARD too if helpful. |
| "Historical comparison is optional" | Past data improves accuracy. Search for it. |
| "Intent confirmation slows things down" | It prevents wasted work on misunderstood requirements. |
| "I don't need to include recommended_agents" | Downstream consensus-review depends on it. Always include. |
| "SIMPLE tasks don't need intent logging" | Log anyway. Calibration data improves future accuracy. |

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Inflating simple tasks | Typo fix = SIMPLE. Don't over-engineer. |
| Deflating complex tasks | Payment/security = COMPLEX. Don't underestimate. |
| Gut-feel tier assignment | Show your math. 7 dimensions, explicit scores. |
| Skipping contextd | Recording enables future efficiency. Always record. |
| Ignoring high-risk dimensions | Risk=3 deserves attention regardless of total. |
| Not applying multipliers | Security/migrations/breaking changes need multipliers. |
| Low confidence without clarification | Use AskUserQuestion when confidence < 60%. |
| Missing decomposition for COMPLEX | Always suggest how to break down COMPLEX tasks. |
| Returning text instead of JSON | Downstream tools expect structured output. |
| Skipping intent confirmation for STANDARD | STANDARD requires plan approval before proceeding. |
| Not including recommended_agents | consensus-review uses this for adaptive agent selection. |
| Setting `all: true` for SIMPLE | Only COMPLEX warrants all 6 reviewers. |

---

## Tracking Assessment Accuracy

After task completion, update the original assessment:

```
mcp__contextd__memory_outcome(
  memory_id: "<original assessment id>",
  outcome: "success|partial|failure",
  notes: "Predicted STANDARD, actual was COMPLEX due to unexpected API rate limits"
)
```

**Track metrics over time:**
- Tier prediction accuracy
- Iteration count vs predicted
- Common underestimation patterns
- Team velocity calibration
