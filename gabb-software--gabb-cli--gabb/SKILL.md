# Gabb Code Navigation

## Search Strategy Decision Flow

When you need to find code, follow this order:

1. **Task names specific file/function?** → Read directly (skip exploration)
2. **Looking for a code construct by name?** → `gabb_symbol`
3. **Looking for text content (strings, error messages)?** → Grep
4. **Need to understand file layout?** → `gabb_structure`

## `gabb_symbol` - Workspace Symbol Search

Search for symbols (functions, classes, methods) by name across the workspace.

**When to use:**
- Task mentions a function/class/method name to find or fix
- You need to find where something is defined
- Grep would return too many false positives

**Example:**
```
gabb_symbol name="update_proxy_model_permissions"
→ function update_proxy_model_permissions [prod] migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py:5:1
```

**Use Grep instead when:**
- Searching for error messages or string literals
- Looking for text patterns, not code identifiers

## `gabb_structure` - File Layout Preview

**First:** Assess if exploration is needed (see MCP instructions).
For trivial tasks with obvious targets, go directly to the file.

**If exploring:** Before reading large or unfamiliar code files, consider using `gabb_structure` to preview the layout.
This saves tokens when you only need part of a large file.

**Recommended for:**
- Large files (>100 lines) where you only need part
- Unfamiliar codebases where you're exploring
- Files you'll read multiple times

**Skip when:**
- You already know exactly what you're looking for
- The file is likely small (<100 lines)
- You can answer from existing context
- Files you've already seen structure for in this conversation
- **You're searching for string literals, regex patterns, or error messages**
  (gabb_structure shows symbols, not strings—use Grep directly)

## Supported Languages

| Language   | Extensions                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Python     | `.py`, `.pyi`                          |
| TypeScript | `.ts`, `.tsx`                          |
| Rust       | `.rs`                                  |
| Go         | `.go`                                  |
| Kotlin     | `.kt`, `.kts`                          |
| C++        | `.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cxx`, `.hpp`, `.hh`   |
| C#         | `.cs`                                  |
| Ruby       | `.rb`                                  |

## Usage Patterns

### Symbol Search
```
gabb_symbol name="MyClass"
→ class MyClass [prod] src/models.py:45:1
```

### File Structure Preview
```
1. gabb_structure file="src/large_file.rs"
   → Returns symbol names, kinds, line numbers (NO source code)

2. Read file_path="src/large_file.rs" offset=150 limit=50
   → Read only the section you need
```

## What `gabb_structure` Output Looks Like

```
/path/to/file.rs:450
Summary: 15 functions, 3 structs | 450 lines
Key types: MyStruct (10 methods)

MyStruct st 10
 new fn 12
 process fn 17
helper fn 30
main fn 50
```

The output shows:
- File path and line count
- Summary stats (function count, struct count, line count)
- Key types with method counts
- Compact symbol tree: `name kind_abbrev line` with single-space indent for children
