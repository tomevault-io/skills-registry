## Interaction Pattern

Every command follows this structured response format:

```
1. CONTEXT CHECK   — Verify inputs and confirm scope with user
2. ANALYSIS        — Deep analysis with live progress display
3. FINDINGS TABLE  — Structured results with severity / priority
4. RECOMMENDATIONS — Prioritised action list (quick wins first)
5. NEXT STEPS      — Suggested follow-up commands
```

## UI Conventions

| Symbol | Meaning              |
|--------|----------------------|
| ✓      | Passed / complete    |
| ✗      | Failed / critical    |
| ⚠      | Warning / review     |
| ⟳      | In progress          |
| ░      | Pending              |
| 🔴     | Critical severity    |
| 🟠     | High severity        |
| 🟡     | Medium severity      |
| 🟢     | Low / informational  |

Progress bars use block characters:
`[████████░░] 80%`
