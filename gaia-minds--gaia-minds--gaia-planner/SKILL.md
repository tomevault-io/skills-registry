# Gaia Planner Skill

Use this skill for planning rounds, backlog reassessment, and roadmap
decomposition tasks.

## Required Context

Read these first:

1. `ROADMAP.md`
2. `STATUS.md`
3. `CHANGELOG.md`
4. `infrastructure/phase2-lane-implementation-plans.md`
5. `infrastructure/planning-round-template.md`

Then inspect relevant open issues/PRs for the scope being planned.

## Planning Workflow

1. Define the planning question and decision deadline.
2. Gather current-state evidence:
   - shipped items
   - in-progress items
   - blockers and risks
   - open dependency contracts
3. Draft the plan using `infrastructure/planning-round-template.md`.
4. Decompose work into independently reviewable items.
5. For each item, specify:
   - scope and non-goals
   - architecture deltas
   - validation plan
   - rollback/fallback
   - acceptance criteria
6. Mark dependencies and integration order explicitly.
7. Create a `needs research` list for unknowns.
8. Run state-sync checks and update (or record no-change reason):
   - `STATUS.md`
   - `ROADMAP.md`
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
   - lane/coordination issue comments

## Required Deliverables

- Planning artifact (issue comment or committed doc) using template sections.
- Clear execution queue with priorities and dependency notes.
- Explicit owner recommendation per item/lane.
- List of unclear items requiring research before implementation.

## Quality Gates

- Every item can be implemented and validated independently.
- Every high-risk item includes rollback and safety/policy impact notes.
- Shared contracts are identified before parallel implementation starts.
- Parallel lanes do not overlap in ownership or scope boundaries.
- State-sync checklist is complete (`updated` or `no change + reason`).

## Closeout

Before ending the planning round:

1. Link planning artifact in the relevant issue/PR.
2. Confirm state files are updated or explicitly unchanged with reason.
3. Add follow-up research tasks for unresolved unknowns.
