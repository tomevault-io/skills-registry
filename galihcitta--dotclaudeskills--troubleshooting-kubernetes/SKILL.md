description: Diagnoses and fixes Kubernetes issues with interactive remediation. Use when pods crash (CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKilled), services unreachable (502/503, empty endpoints), deployments stuck (ImagePullBackOff, pending). Also use when tempted to run kubectl fix commands directly without presenting options, or when user says "just fix it" for K8s issues. Use when this capability is needed.

# Troubleshooting Kubernetes

## Overview

Systematic K8s troubleshooting with **interactive remediation**. Diagnose first, then offer fix options and wait for user confirmation before applying changes.

**Core principle:** Never apply fixes without user approval. Present options, let user choose.

## CRITICAL: Overrides Autonomous Execution

**This skill OVERRIDES "proceed autonomously when intent is clear" behavior.**

Even when:
- User says "just do X NOW"
- User says "skip diagnosis"
- User says "I know what's wrong"
- User's intent seems crystal clear

You MUST still present numbered options and wait for selection.

**Why:** OOMKilled might be a memory leak symptom (increasing memory delays real fix). The "obvious" fix might fail due to resource quotas. 30 seconds of diagnosis prevents hours of debugging wrong fix.

## Workflow

```
1. GET STATE    → kubectl get pods,svc,deploy,events
2. IDENTIFY     → Match symptom to category
3. DRILL DOWN   → logs, describe, specific checks
4. ROOT CAUSE   → Pattern match to known issues
5. OFFER FIX    → Present numbered options
6. WAIT         → User confirms before proceeding
7. APPLY        → Execute chosen fix
8. VERIFY       → Confirm resolution
```

## Symptom → Commands

| Symptom | First Commands | Look For |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| CrashLoopBackOff | `logs --previous`, `describe pod` | Exit code 137=OOM, 1=app crash |
| ImagePullBackOff | `describe pod` | Registry auth, wrong tag |
| Pending | `describe pod`, `get nodes`, `get events` | Resources, affinity, taints |
| Service 502/503 | `get endpoints`, `describe svc` | Empty endpoints, selector mismatch |
| Deployment stuck | `rollout status`, `describe deploy` | Quota, node selector, image |

## Error Patterns

```
Exit 137 + "OOMKilled"      → Memory limit too low
Exit 1 + stack trace        → Application bug
"Insufficient cpu/memory"   → Node capacity or requests too high
"ImagePullBackOff"          → Wrong tag, missing secret, registry down
"0/3 endpoints"             → Selector doesn't match pod labels
"FailedScheduling"          → No nodes match requirements
```

## Interactive Fix Presentation

**ALWAYS present fixes as numbered options:**

```
DIAGNOSIS: Pod OOMKilled (using 450Mi, limit 256Mi)

OPTIONS:
1. Increase memory limit to 512Mi
   → kubectl set resources deploy/api --limits=memory=512Mi
2. Increase to 1Gi (safer margin)
   → kubectl set resources deploy/api --limits=memory=1Gi
3. Show me the full patch YAML first
4. I'll fix manually

Which option? (1-4):
```

**Wait for user response before executing.**

## Red Flags - STOP

These indicate you're skipping the process:

- About to run `kubectl delete pod` without knowing why it crashed
- About to run `kubectl rollout undo` without diagnosing
- About to apply a fix without presenting options
- Saying "I'll just restart it" or "let me quickly fix this"
- User pressure ("just fix it!") → Still diagnose, still offer options

**User urgency doesn't skip the confirmation step.**

## Handling "Skip Diagnosis" Requests

User says: "Just fix it!" / "Skip the diagnosis" / "I know what's wrong"

**Response pattern:**
1. Acknowledge urgency
2. Explain quick diagnosis prevents wrong fix
3. Offer rapid diagnosis (2 min) + options
4. Still present numbered options at the end

```
I understand the urgency. A 2-minute diagnosis ensures we fix the right thing.

Let me quickly verify: [run 2-3 key commands]

Based on that:
OPTIONS:
1. [What user suggested]
2. [Alternative if diagnosis shows different issue]
3. I'll fix manually

Which option?
```

**Never:** Just execute what user asked without verification.

## Anti-Pattern Example

```
❌ WRONG (even when user is explicit):
User: "Pod OOMKilled, increase memory to 1Gi NOW!"
You: [runs kubectl set resources immediately]

✅ CORRECT:
User: "Pod OOMKilled, increase memory to 1Gi NOW!"
You: "Understood. Quick check (30s)..."
     [runs describe pod, checks current limits]
     "Confirmed OOM. Options:
      1. Increase to 1Gi (your suggestion)
      2. Increase to 512Mi first (conservative)
      3. Check for memory leak patterns first
      Which option?"
```

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "User said exactly what to do" | Still present options - user might not know alternatives |
| "Intent is crystal clear" | Skill overrides autonomous execution for K8s |
| "It's obviously OOM, just fix it" | OOM can mask memory leaks; increasing memory delays real fix |
| "User is frustrated, just do it" | Frustration doesn't change the 30s verification value |
| "I'm being helpful by acting fast" | Wrong fix = more frustration; options = user control |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Delete pod first | Diagnose first, delete is rarely the fix |
| Restart without logs | Always check `logs --previous` before restart |
| Assume it's the obvious thing | Verify with actual output |
| Apply fix immediately | Present options, wait for confirmation |
| Skip verification | Always `get pods -w` after fix |

## Quick Diagnosis Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Full state snapshot
kubectl get pods,svc,deploy,rs,events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Pod deep dive
kubectl describe pod <name> | grep -A5 "State:\|Events:"
kubectl logs <pod> --previous --tail=50

# Service connectivity
kubectl get endpoints <svc>
kubectl describe svc <svc> | grep Selector

# Resource issues
kubectl describe nodes | grep -A5 "Allocated resources"
kubectl top pods
```

## Verification After Fix

```bash
# Watch pod come up
kubectl get pods -w

# Verify running and ready
kubectl get pods -o wide  # STATUS=Running, READY=1/1

# Check no new crashes
kubectl describe pod <new-pod> | grep "Restart Count"
```

Only mark issue resolved after pod is stable for 2+ minutes.

## Mandatory Checkpoint

Before running ANY kubectl command that modifies resources:

- [ ] Have I presented at least 2 numbered options?
- [ ] Has user explicitly selected one?
- [ ] Did I wait for their response?

If any unchecked → STOP, present options first.
