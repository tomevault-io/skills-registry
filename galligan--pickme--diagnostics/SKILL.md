# Pickme Diagnostics Skill

Systematic troubleshooting for pickme indexing issues.

## Decision Tree

```text
File missing from pickme?
|-- Does file exist?
|   |-- No -> File path issue, not pickme
|-- Is file gitignored?
|   |-- Yes -> Check include_gitignored setting
|-- Is file in a configured root?
|   |-- No -> Add root or adjust paths
|-- Is file excluded by pattern?
|   |-- Yes -> Remove or adjust exclude pattern
|-- Is root disabled?
|   |-- Yes -> Enable root
|-- Is index stale?
|   |-- Yes -> Run pickme refresh
```

## Diagnostic Commands

### Quick Status

```bash
pickme status
pickme roots
pickme config --show
```

### Check Specific File

```bash
# Is it indexed?
pickme search --exact "path/to/file"

# Is it gitignored?
git check-ignore -v "path/to/file"

# Is it in a root?
pickme roots | grep "$(dirname path/to/file)"
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### File Not Found in Index

Diagnosis steps:

1. Verify file exists: `ls -la path/to/file`
2. Check gitignore: `git check-ignore -v path/to/file`
3. Check roots: `pickme roots`
4. Check excludes: `pickme config --show | grep -A10 exclude`

Common fixes:

- Enable gitignored files: set `include_gitignored = true`
- Add parent as root: add a `[[roots]]` entry
- Remove overly broad exclude pattern

### Stale Index

Symptoms:

- Deleted files still appearing
- New files not showing
- Mismatch between filesystem and results

Fix:

```bash
pickme refresh
# or re-index a root
pickme index /path/to/root
```

### Too Many Results

Symptoms:

- Search returns noise
- Unrelated files appearing
- Slow search performance

Fixes:

- Add exclude patterns for generated files
- Reduce max_depth
- Use more specific roots

## Resolution Flow

1. Identify symptom (missing file, stale data, noise)
2. Run diagnostics (2-3 commands max)
3. Determine cause (use decision tree)
4. Apply fix (config edit or command)
5. Verify resolution (`pickme search` to confirm)

Target: Resolve in 2 steps after diagnosis.
