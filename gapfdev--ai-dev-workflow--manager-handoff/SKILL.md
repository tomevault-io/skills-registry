# Manager Handoff Protocol

This skill defines how the **Manager Agent** communicates tasks to **Developer Agents** (or other specialized roles) using a "Source of Truth" Markdown file.

## Input
- Completed step context and deliverables.
- Target role for next execution step.
- Task scope, constraints, and expected output.

## Output
- A handoff brief in `.agent/temp/task_<ID>_<SHORT_NAME>.md`.
- A self-contained execution contract for the receiving agent.
- A completion-report expectation for closure hygiene.

## Process

### Phase 1: Define the Channel
- **Directory**: `.agent/temp/`
- **Naming Convention**: `task_<ID>_<SHORT_NAME>.md`
  - Example: `.agent/temp/task_001_auth_setup.md`

### Phase 2: Create the Task Brief
Every handoff file MUST follow this structure to ensure the receiving agent has 100% of the context needed to execute without asking questions.

```markdown
# Task: [Task Name]
**ID**: [Ticket-ID]
**Role**: [Target Role, e.g., Dev Agent]

## 1. Context
(Briefly explain *why* we are doing this. Link to Product Vision or Tech Strategy if needed.)

## 2. Requirements (The "What")
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2

## 3. Technical Constraints (The "How")
- **File(s) to Modify**: `src/auth.py`
- **Style/Pattern**: Use the Repository Pattern.
- **Libraries**: Use `pydantic` for validation.

## 4. Deliverables
- Source Code: `[file_path]`
- Tests: `[test_path]`

## 5. Definition of Done (Verification)
- [ ] Code compiles.
- [ ] Unit tests pass.
- [ ] Linter is happy.
```

### Phase 3: Execute Handoff Workflow
1.  **Manager** creates the brief in `.agent/temp/`.
2.  **Manager** signals the **Developer** to read the specific file.
3.  **Developer** executes the task using the file as the absolute Source of Truth.
4.  **Developer** writes a completion report (or updates the task file) when done.

### Phase 4: Maintain Handoff Hygiene
- These files are **ephemeral** but serve as the logs of specific task assignments.
- Do not commit `.agent/temp` to Git (it is in `.gitignore`).
- If a task changes significantly, update the Brief file first, then tell the Agent.

### Phase 5: Re-delegation (Salvage Mode)
When re-assigning a ticket from a failed, stale, or crashed agent:
1. Check if the previous agent left a branch on remote (e.g., `codex/<ticket-id>-<slug>`).
2. If a branch exists, instruct the new agent to fetch and assess it before writing new code.
3. Document in the brief what was salvageable and what needs to be redone.
4. Update the task brief with explicit salvage instructions: "Agent [X] stalled. Branch `[branch-name]` may contain partial work. Assess, salvage, or reset."

## Rules
1. **ALWAYS** provide a self-contained brief with context, constraints, and DoD.
2. **ALWAYS** update the brief before asking the receiving agent to proceed.
3. **NEVER** delegate work without a concrete output path or artifact expectation.
4. **NEVER** treat conversational history as source of truth over the handoff brief.
