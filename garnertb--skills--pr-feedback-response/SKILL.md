# PR Feedback Response

Structured workflow for holistically addressing PR review feedback with proper
triage, planning, and tracked implementation.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Fetch & Triage** - Gather all unresolved comments, assess each for
   actionability
2. **Plan** - Enter plan mode, draft approach for each feedback item
3. **Review Plan** - Consult principal-engineer-review skill to validate
   approach
4. **Present & Decide** - Show summary to user, get decisions on declined items
5. **Implement** - Execute plan with logical commit grouping

## Step 1: Fetch & Triage Feedback

### Fetch All Unresolved Comments

Use GitHub MCP tools to get complete PR context:

```
1. pull_request_read (method: get, perPage: 100)
   → Get PR description, extract linked issue numbers (e.g., "Fixes #123", "Closes #456")

2. pull_request_read (method: get_review_comments, perPage: 100)
   → Filter for threads where isResolved === false

3. pull_request_read (method: get_reviews, perPage: 100)
   → Capture formal review feedback (REQUEST_CHANGES especially)

4. pull_request_read (method: get_comments, perPage: 100)
   → General PR conversation that may contain actionable feedback

5. For each linked issue:
   issue_read (method: get) → Get issue context, requirements, acceptance criteria
   issue_read (method: get_comments) → Get discussion that may inform feedback triage
```

### Related Issues Context

Document linked issues in the plan to inform triage decisions:

```markdown
### Related Issues

- **#123**: [Issue title] - [Brief summary of requirements/acceptance criteria]
- **#456**: [Issue title] - [Brief summary]
```

Use issue context to assess whether feedback aligns with original requirements
or represents scope creep.

### Triage Each Comment

For each piece of feedback, determine disposition:

| Disposition                         | Criteria                          | Action                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Accept**                          | Valid, actionable, in-scope       | Plan implementation    |
| **Decline - Out of Scope**          | Valid but beyond PR intent        | Document reasoning     |
| **Decline - Cost/Complexity**       | Disproportionate effort for value | Document reasoning     |
| **Decline - Technically Incorrect** | Suggestion is wrong or harmful    | Document reasoning     |
| **Clarification Needed**            | Ambiguous or unclear request      | Note for user decision |

### Triage Output Format

For each comment, document:

```markdown
### Comment #N: [Brief summary]

- **Author**: @username
- **Location**: file.ts:42 (or "general" for PR comments)
- **Quote**: "[First 100 chars of comment]..."
- **Disposition**: Accept | Decline | Clarify
- **Reasoning**: [Why this disposition]
- **Recommended Response**: [If declined, suggested reply text]
```

## Step 2: Plan Implementation

Enter plan mode and create structured plan in session workspace.

### Plan Structure

```markdown
# PR Feedback Response Plan

## PR Context

- PR #: [number]
- Title: [title]
- Total Feedback Items: [N]
- Accepted: [N] | Declined: [N] | Needs Clarification: [N]

## Feedback Triage

### Accepted Items

[List each with brief implementation approach]

### Declined Items

[List each with reasoning and recommended response]

### Items Needing Clarification

[List with specific questions for user]

## Implementation Plan

### Commit Strategy

[Group related changes into logical commits]

### Commit 1: [Description]

- Addresses: Comment #N, #M (if related)
- Files: [list]
- Changes: [brief description]

### Commit 2: [Description]

...

## Risks & Considerations

[Any technical debt, edge cases, or concerns]
```

### Commit Grouping Rules

- **Cross-related feedback** → Group into single logical commit
- **Independent feedback** → Separate commit per feedback item
- Each commit message MUST reference the feedback it addresses

## Step 3: Consult Principal Engineer Review

After drafting the plan, invoke the `principal-engineer-review` skill:

> "Review this PR feedback response plan. Assess:
>
> 1. Are any declined items incorrectly triaged?
> 2. Are implementation approaches sound?
> 3. Is the commit grouping logical?
> 4. Any risks or edge cases missed?"

Iterate on plan based on principal engineer feedback until validated.

## Step 4: Present Summary & Get User Decisions

Present a concise summary to user:

```markdown
## PR Feedback Summary

**Accepted** (N items): [Brief list]

**Declined** (N items): For each declined item, show:

- Comment summary
- Reasoning
- Recommended response
- [Ask: Create reply comment? Y/N]

**Needs Clarification** (N items): [Show ambiguous items, ask for direction]

Ready to implement? [Confirm or modify plan]
```

Use `ask_user` tool for:

- Each declined item: whether to post a reply comment
- Any clarification items: what direction to take
- Final confirmation before implementation

## Step 5: Implement Plan

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Make changes per commit plan
- [ ] Run relevant tests/linting
- [ ] Create commits with messages referencing feedback
- [ ] Post reply comments for declined items (if user approved)
- [ ] Verify all accepted feedback is addressed

### Commit Message Format

```
Address PR feedback: [brief description]

Addresses feedback from @[author]:
- [Summary of comment]

[Additional context if needed]
```

### Reply Comment Format (for declined items)

```
Thanks for the feedback! After consideration:

[Reasoning for not implementing]

[If applicable: "This could be addressed in a follow-up PR/issue."]
```

## Error Handling

- **Cannot fetch PR data**: Verify PR number and repository access
- **Conflicting feedback**: Flag for user decision, do not assume
- **Implementation failures**: Roll back, document issue, ask for guidance
