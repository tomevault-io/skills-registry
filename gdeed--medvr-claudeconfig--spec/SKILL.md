## Instructions

When the user invokes `/spec`, you should:

1. **Review the conversation** to identify what was recently built, fixed, or modified
2. **Determine the appropriate spec type** based on the work:
   - **Immersive experience** → Create in `specs/immersive/`
   - **New feature/flow** → Create in `specs/features/`
   - **Architecture change** → Update `specs/architecture.md`
   - **General spec** → Create in `specs/`

3. **Create the spec file** with this structure:
   ```markdown
   # [Feature Name]

   **File(s):** `path/to/file.swift`

   **Purpose:** One-line description
