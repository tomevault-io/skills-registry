# EchoZero Core Values

## The Two Pillars

### 1. "The Best Part is No Part"
- Question every new class, method, abstraction, feature, or dependency
- Can we delete code instead of adding it?
- Does this solve a real problem or anticipated complexity?
- Three simple functions beat one complex abstraction

### 2. "Simplicity and Refinement are Key"
- Simple is what remains after removing everything unnecessary
- Code should read like prose; no cleverness for its own sake
- Explicit over implicit; boring is good
- One obvious way to do things

## Derived Principles

| Principle | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Default to Deletion | First ask "What can I remove?" |
| Question New Abstractions | Pattern emerged 3+ places? Rule of Three before abstracting |
| Make Common Things Easy | Optimize for 80% use case |
| Explicit Over Implicit | No magic; easy to debug and test |
| Composition Over Inheritance | Build from simple independent parts |
| Optimize for Reading | Code is read 10x more than written |
| Errors Impossible or Obvious | Prevent via types or make immediately visible |
| Data Over Code | Prefer data-driven solutions |

## Decision Framework

Apply these filters in order:

1. **Is This Necessary?** What problem? Do users have it? Can we not do this?
2. **Can We Remove Instead?** Net complexity change?
3. **What's the Simplest Solution?** Dumbest thing that could work?
4. **What's the Cost?** LOC, dependencies, concepts, testing, maintenance?
5. **Is It Reversible?** Can we undo this later?

## Anti-Patterns to Reject

- Premature generalization ("we might need X someday")
- Resume-driven development (cool tech for its own sake)
- Abstraction addiction (interfaces with one implementation, factories for one type)
- Feature creep ("it would be cool if...")
- "More flexible", "cleaner", "best practices" without concrete problem

## Mantras

1. "Can I delete this instead?"
2. "What's the simplest thing that could work?"
3. "Will I be happy debugging this at 3am?"
4. "Am I being clever or clear?"
5. "Does this make the system simpler or more complex?"
