# Verify ProcessWire Skill

Verify an existing ProcessWire skill's accuracy and best practices compliance against source material.

## Input

Accepts either:
1. **Same session**: output from `/create-pw-skill` (sources + file structure already in context)
2. **Manual**: skill path + source paths/URLs via $ARGUMENTS

If neither available, ask the user for the skill path and source material.

## Checklist

Copy and track progress:

```
- [ ] 1. Identify inputs
- [ ] 2. Read best practices
- [ ] 3. Run parallel verification
- [ ] 4. Compile issue table
- [ ] 5. Present to user
- [ ] 6. Apply approved fixes
```

## Workflow

### 1. Identify inputs

Determine the skill directory and list its files (SKILL.md + reference files). Confirm all source material (paths, URLs) with the user.

### 2. Read best practices

Fetch and read:
https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices

Focus on: description format, progressive disclosure, line limits, file structure, naming conventions.

### 3. Run parallel verification

Launch one subagent per reference file. Each subagent reads its file and the relevant source material, checking three dimensions:

**Accuracy**
- Method signatures match source (argument names, order, types)
- Property names and values are correct
- Code syntax is valid (`namespace ProcessWire`, correct API patterns)
- No contradictions with source

**Coverage**
- Important features present in source but missing from skill
- Missing common patterns or pitfalls documented in source

**Best practices**
- SKILL.md is lean overview with progressive disclosure to reference files
- Description: third-person verbs, trigger terms, "Use when..." clause
- SKILL.md body under 500 lines
- Table of contents in files over 100 lines
- Reference files one level deep, descriptive filenames
- No info the assistant already knows (basic PHP, etc.)

Also verify SKILL.md frontmatter (name matches directory, description under 1024 chars).

### 4. Compile issue table

Merge all subagent results into a single table sorted by severity:

| File | Issue | Severity | Details |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| ... | ... | inaccuracy | ... |
| ... | ... | coverage-gap | ... |
| ... | ... | style | ... |

### 5. Present to user

Display the issue table. **Stop here.** Do not make any changes. Wait for the user to review and specify which issues to address.

### 6. Apply approved fixes

Fix only the issues the user approves. Do not make any other changes.

## Rules

- Always verify method signatures against actual source code, not just documentation
- Use parallel subagents (one per reference file) for efficiency
- Never auto-fix without explicit user approval
- If a skill has no reference files (only SKILL.md), run a single verification pass
