# Agent Builder Skill

## Overview

The Agent Builder skill is an **interactive workflow orchestrator** that guides you through building production-ready AI agents from concept to deployment. It implements a proven **9-stage methodology** and supports **two-phase operation** for maximum flexibility:

- **Phase 1 (Design)**: Interactive planning and comprehensive design documentation generation
- **Phase 2 (Scaffolding)**: Project setup and boilerplate code generation in any target location
- **Phase 3 (Operations)**: Deploy, observe, and evaluate in production with continuous improvement

**The 9 Stages:**
1. **BRAINSTORM** → 2. **DESIGN** → 3. **IMPLEMENT** → 4. **TEST** → 5. **DOCUMENT** → 6. **DEPLOY** → 7. **OBSERVE** → 8. **EVALUATE** → 9. **ITERATE**

This skill helps you make informed architectural decisions, apply proven patterns, avoid common pitfalls, and produce high-quality documentation from the start. It integrates **6 foundational principles** and **organizational standards** through optional progressive hints at key decision points.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when you:

- Want to **build a new AI agent** from scratch
- Need to **design an agentic system** or multi-agent architecture
- Are **planning an agent project** and need architecture guidance
- Want to **scaffold an agent project** with proper structure
- Need help with **SDK selection** (Claude SDK, OpenAI Agents, Strands, LangGraph, etc.)
- Want to **apply proven agent patterns** to your use case
- Need **comprehensive design documentation** before implementation
- Want to **separate design and implementation** phases

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Help me build an agent for..."
- "I want to create an AI agent that..."
- "Guide me through designing an agent for..."
- "What's the best way to build an agent that..."
- "I need to scaffold a new agent project"
- "Help me choose the right SDK for..."

## How This Skill Works

### Two-Phase Workflow

#### Phase 1: Design & Documentation (Interactive)

**Purpose**: Plan and document your agent thoroughly before writing code

**Process**: Interactive guided questioning through:
1. **BRAINSTORM** - Define problem, use case, success criteria, choose SDK/language
2. **DESIGN** - Define agent persona, design tools, plan workflow, choose patterns

**Output**:
- `agent-design-document.md` - Comprehensive human-readable design specification
- `scaffolding-manifest.json` - Machine-readable specification for code generation

**Key Benefits**:
- Document in any location (doesn't require target project to exist)
- Review and approve design before implementation
- Version control design decisions
- Share designs with team for feedback
- Portable between projects

#### Phase 2: Scaffolding & Implementation

**Purpose**: Generate project structure and boilerplate from design document

**Input**: Design document from Phase 1

**Process**:
1. Parse design document and manifest
2. Create directory structure
3. Generate boilerplate code with placeholders
4. Create configuration files
5. Generate pre-filled documentation
6. Setup testing structure

**Output**: Complete project structure ready for customization

**Key Benefits**:
- Can scaffold in different location than design
- Consistent project structure
- Pre-filled documentation
- Validation schemas scaffolded
- 2-4 hours of setup time saved

### Interactive Questioning Framework

The skill asks targeted questions at each stage to gather requirements and guide decisions. Questions are based on proven best practices and real-world patterns.

**Question Types**:
- **Decision questions** - Choose between well-defined options (SDK, language, complexity)
- **Definition questions** - Describe use case, success criteria, tool specifications
- **Validation questions** - Confirm decisions, check for missing requirements
- **Pattern questions** - Identify which proven patterns apply to your use case

- Example: Portfolio analysis, multi-agent collaboration

## Proven Patterns Catalog

### Pattern 1: Zod/Pydantic Validation

**Purpose**: Type-safe input validation with runtime checking

**When to use**: All agents should validate tool inputs

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// TypeScript with Zod
const ToolInputSchema = z.object({
  param: z.number().positive(),
  option: z.enum(['a', 'b', 'c'])
});
const validated = ToolInputSchema.parse(input);
```

```python
# Python with Pydantic
class ToolInput(BaseModel):
    param: int = Field(gt=0)
    option: Literal['a', 'b', 'c']
```

### Pattern 2: Subagent Specialization

**Purpose**: Delegate tasks by complexity or domain

**When to use**: Different tasks require different reasoning depth

**Implementation**:
- Sonnet for complex reasoning and deep analysis
- Haiku for optimization and quick calculations
- Pass clear context in subagent prompts
- Define specific success criteria

### Pattern 3: Mock Data First

**Purpose**: Development independence from external APIs

**When to use**: Always (accelerates testing, enables local development)

**Implementation**:
- Structure mock data identically to real API responses
- Use clear TODO comments for replacement points
- Support both mock and real via environment config
- Test with mock, deploy with real

### Pattern 4: Service-Based Architecture

**Purpose**: Separation of concerns, testability, reusability

**When to use**: Medium to high complexity agents

**Implementation**:
- Models layer (Pydantic validation)
- Services layer (business logic)
- Tools layer (Claude-callable wrappers)

### Pattern 5: Parallel Execution

**Purpose**: Performance improvement for independent tasks

**When to use**: Multiple agents/tools with no dependencies

**Implementation**:
```python
# Python with asyncio
results = await asyncio.gather(
    agent1.run(task1),
    agent2.run(task2),
    agent3.run(task3)
)
```

**Results**: 65%+ faster for 3+ parallel tasks

### Pattern 6: Weighted Scoring

**Purpose**: Multi-dimensional assessment with transparent calculation

**When to use**: Suitability analysis, ranking, prioritization

**Implementation**:
```python
score = (
    compliance_score * 0.35 +
    risk_score * 0.25 +
    performance_score * 0.25 +
    time_horizon_score * 0.15
)
```

### Pattern 7: Direct Context Passing (No RAG)

**Purpose**: Avoid RAG complexity for small document collections

**When to use**:
- Working with 1 file at a time
- Documents are 5-20 pages each
- Entire document fits in LLM context window
- User doesn't need semantic search across 100s of documents

**Benefits**: 3-step workflow vs 7+ steps with RAG

### Pattern 8: Graceful Degradation

**Purpose**: Partial success better than total failure

**When to use**: Always (production-grade systems)

**Implementation**:
- Handle missing data → Skip specific calculations, continue
- Handle API unavailable → Use cached/mock data
- Handle timeouts → Return partial results with warnings
- Always provide user feedback on degraded operation

## Best Practices

### Keep It Simple
- Start with 3-5 tools, add more only if needed
- Use 0-2 subagents for most agents
- Apply patterns only when they solve real problems
- Avoid over-engineering

### Document as You Go
- Update design document if requirements change
- Keep CLAUDE.md current
- Document "why" not just "what"
- Capture learnings in memory system

### Validate Early
- Use Zod/Pydantic from the start
- Handle errors at tool boundaries
- Test with invalid inputs immediately
- Don't defer error handling

### Think Production-Grade
- Error handling from day one
- No "fix it later" mentality
- Mock data structured like production data
- Documentation complete before deployment

### Iterate Incrementally
- Build tools one at a time
- Test each tool individually
- Add complexity gradually
- Commit often

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Over-engineering** - Building for imaginary future needs
✅ **Do instead**: Build exactly what's needed now, refactor later

❌ **Too many tools** - Starting with 10+ tools
✅ **Do instead**: Start with 3-5 focused tools, add as needed

❌ **Skipping validation** - "I'll add validation later"
✅ **Do instead**: Zod/Pydantic schemas from the first tool

❌ **Unclear workflows** - Agent does "everything"
✅ **Do instead**: Define clear stages (Discovery → Analysis → Recommendation)

❌ **Poor error handling** - Assuming APIs always work
✅ **Do instead**: Graceful degradation, clear error messages

❌ **Documentation debt** - "I'll document it when it's done"
✅ **Do instead**: Design document before code, update as you build

❌ **Premature optimization** - Complex caching before measuring performance
✅ **Do instead**: Build simple version, measure, then optimize

## Progressive Standards Integration

This skill offers **optional progressive hints** at key decision points throughout the workflow. When you see a hint, you can choose to apply the referenced standard or skip it based on your project's needs.

### How Progressive Hints Work

At specific stages, you'll be prompted with questions like:

> 💡 "Apply 6 Principles decision framework?"
> 💡 "Classify with Agent Taxonomy (Level 0-4)?"
> 💡 "Apply deployment gates checklist?"

**If you answer Yes**: The skill will guide you through applying that standard, referencing the appropriate documentation.

**If you answer No**: The skill continues without enforcement—standards are guidance, not gates.

### When Standards Apply

| Scope | Apply These Standards |
|-------|----------------------|
| **All Agents** | Zod/Pydantic validation, error handling, basic logging |
| **Production** | 6 Principles check, testing pyramid (80/15/5), deployment gates |
| **Enterprise** | Full OTel observability, evaluation framework, SPIFFE identity, A2A protocol |

### Hint Trigger Points

| Stage | Hints Available |
|-------|-----------------|
| BRAINSTORM | "Apply 6 Principles decision framework?", "Classify with Agent Taxonomy?" |
| DESIGN | "Apply A2A protocol standards?", "Need memory strategy guidance?" |
| IMPLEMENT | "Apply coding standards (lint/validation)?" |
| TEST | "Apply testing pyramid (80/15/5)?" |
| DEPLOY | "Apply deployment gates checklist?" |
| OBSERVE | "Setup OpenTelemetry observability?" |
| EVALUATE | "Define evaluation framework?" |
