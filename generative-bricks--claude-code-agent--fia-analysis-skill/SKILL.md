# Fixed Indexed Annuity Product Analyzer

This skill provides a complete framework for analyzing fixed indexed annuities (FIAs), creating comprehensive product profiles, and determining client suitability through structured assessment.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Analyzing a specific FIA product (e.g., "Analyze the Allianz Benefit Control FIA")
- Creating product comparison documents
- Determining if an FIA is suitable for a prospect/client
- Building internal product knowledge base
- Evaluating product features, rates, and structures
- Running suitability assessments with incomplete client data

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Data Collection

Gather comprehensive product information across these categories:

   - Surrender charge schedule (by year)
   - Market Value Adjustment (MVA) provisions
   - Allocation charges (current and maximum)
   - Rider fees (if applicable)
   - Free withdrawal provisions

3. **Index Options**
   - All available indexes with descriptions
   - Index characteristics (volatility-controlled, diversified, etc.)

## Suitability Questionnaire for LLM Analysis

### Instructions for LLM Use
**Answering Questions:**
- Answer YES or NO to each question based on available prospect/client data
- If insufficient data exists to answer a specific question, mark it as "UNABLE TO ANSWER" or "N/A"

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Suitability Score = (Total YES answers ÷ Total Answerable Questions) × 100

**Scoring Interpretation:**
- 80-100%: Highly Suitable

- Tables for surrender charges and withdrawal percentages
- Clear section breaks
- Page numbers

**PDF Creation Example:**
```python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, Spacer, Table, TableStyle, PageBreak
from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet, ParagraphStyle
from reportlab.lib import colors
from reportlab.lib.units import inch

# Define custom styles for consistency
title_style = ParagraphStyle('CustomTitle', fontSize=24, textColor=colors.HexColor('#003366'))
heading1_style = ParagraphStyle('CustomHeading1', fontSize=16, textColor=colors.HexColor('#003366'))
# ... etc

# Create document
doc = SimpleDocTemplate("output.pdf", pagesize=letter)
story = []

# Build content
story.append(Paragraph("Product Name", title_style))
# ... add all content sections

doc.build(story)
```

### Step 3: Output Delivery

1. **Save both formats** to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`:
   - Markdown: `[product_name]_analysis.md`
   - PDF: `[product_name]_analysis.pdf`

2. **Provide links** to both files:
   - [View Markdown](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/[product_name]_analysis.md)
   - [View PDF](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/[product_name]_analysis.pdf)

3. **Brief summary** of findings (2-3 sentences)

## Best Practices

### Data Quality
- **Always search for current rates** - they change frequently
- **Verify from multiple sources** when possible
- **Include disclaimers** about rate changes
- **Note data limitations** when information is unavailable

### Suitability Assessment
- **Be objective** - present both pros and cons
- **Consider the whole profile** - not just one factor
- **Explain reasoning** in good/not good fit sections
- **Account for missing data** - use N/A scoring properly

### Documentation
- **Be comprehensive but concise** - avoid unnecessary repetition
- **Use tables for numerical data** - easier to scan
- **Include examples** - especially for complex features
- **Provide context** - explain industry norms and comparisons

### LLM-Friendly Formatting
- **Markdown structure** - clear hierarchy with headers
- **Consistent formatting** - makes parsing easier
- **Explicit instructions** - don't assume understanding
- **Scoring methodology** - detailed and unambiguous

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Make up rates or data points
- Guarantee future performance
- Ignore surrender charges or fees
- Oversimplify complex features
- Score without adequate data
- Copy marketing language verbatim
- Recommend without understanding client needs

✅ **Do:**
- State when data is unavailable
- Emphasize realistic expectations
- Highlight all fees and charges
- Explain features in plain language
- Use N/A for missing data points
- Provide balanced analysis
- Focus on suitability match

## Product-Specific Adaptations

While the framework is standard, adapt these elements for each product:

1. **Questionnaire customization**
   - Adjust age ranges based on product minimums
   - Include/exclude questions based on available features
   - Modify dollar amounts for premium requirements

2. **Good/Not Good Fit categories**
   - Emphasize product-specific strengths
   - Highlight unique disqualifiers
   - Match to target market

3. **Special features section**
   - Focus on differentiators
   - Explain proprietary features
   - Compare to industry norms

## Example Usage

**User Request:** "Analyze the Nationwide Peak 10 FIA for me"

**Response Flow:**
1. Search for Nationwide Peak 10 product information
2. Gather surrender charges, index options, crediting methods, riders
3. Create markdown document with all sections
4. Generate professional PDF
5. Output both files to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`
6. Provide links and brief summary

## Handling Incomplete Information

When data is unavailable:

1. **In the document:**
   - Note: "Current rates not publicly available - contact issuer"
   - State: "Information on [feature] could not be verified"
   - Include: "As of [date], the following information was available..."

2. **In scoring:**
   - Questions without data are marked N/A
   - Only answerable questions count in denominator
   - Document lists which questions couldn't be answered

3. **In recommendations:**
   - Acknowledge limitations
   - Suggest additional research needed
   - Recommend verification with licensed professional

## Skill Output Quality Standards

A complete analysis should include:

✅ All major sections populated with data
✅ At least 6 index options documented (or all available)
✅ Full 10+ year surrender charge schedule
✅ 40-question suitability assessment
✅ Both markdown and PDF formats
✅ Realistic return expectations stated
✅ Critical disclosures included
✅ Professional formatting and styling
✅ Links provided to user
✅ Clear scoring methodology explained

## Updates and Maintenance

This skill framework should be updated when:
- Industry standards change significantly
- New product types emerge (e.g., new hybrid structures)
- Regulatory requirements affect disclosures
- User feedback suggests improvements
- Common data sources become unavailable

---

**Remember:** The goal is to provide objective, comprehensive analysis that helps determine product-client fit while being transparent about limitations, fees, and realistic expectations.
