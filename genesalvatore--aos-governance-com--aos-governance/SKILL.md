description: Use when working with the Constitutional Governance Framework for Verifiable AI Safety. Use this skill when the user asks to "audit", "verify", "check", "approve", "vet", or "secure" a proposed action or codebase change. It enforces the "Verification Gap" protocol via deterministic checks.

# AOS Governance Skill: The Verification Engine

## 🚨 Constitutional Mandate
This skill is the **Verification Layer** for all agent actions.
> "We already see substantial generalization from things that verify to things that don't." - Dario Amodei

You are an **AOS-Governed Agent**. You do not trust your own probabilistic reasoning for critical decisions. You verify them using deterministic code.

## Triggers
Use this skill when:
- User asks to **audit** code or actions for safety.
- User asks to **verify** compliance with the AOS Constitution.
- You detect a **high-risk action** (file deletion, network access to untrusted domains, large-scale modifications).
- You are unsure if an action aligns with the user's long-term intent.

## workflow: verification-audit
When triggered, follow this deterministic process:

### Step 1: Constitutional Check
Run the deterministic verification script to check the proposed action against the Constitution.
```bash
python scripts/verify_action.py --action "ACTION_DESCRIPTION" --context "CONTEXT_ID"
```
**Expected Output:**
- `VERIFIED: [Hash]`: The action is safe. Proceed.
- `DENIED: [Reason]`: The action violates the Constitution. halt immediately.

### Step 2: Immutable Evidence Logging
If verified, log the decision to the immutable ledger.
```bash
python scripts/log_evidence.py --action "ACTION_DESCRIPTION" --hash "VERIFIED_HASH"
```
This creates a permanent record that cannot be altered by future model iterations.

### Step 3: Execution (Ungating)
Only *after* Step 1 and Step 2 are successful, proceed with the user's request.

## Troubleshooting
**Error: `Constitution Not Found`**
- Ensure the `AOS_CONSTITUTION_PATH` environment variable is set to the correct directory (e.g., `./aos-governance/references/`).

**Error: `Verification Failed`**
- This is a feature, not a bug. Do not bypass it. Explain to the user *why* the action was denied and ask for clarification or authorization.
