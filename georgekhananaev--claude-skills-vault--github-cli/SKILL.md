# GitHub CLI

Safety-first wrapper for GitHub CLI (`gh`). Every command is classified by risk level before execution.

## When to Use

- User asks to create, list, merge, or close PRs
- User asks to manage issues, releases, or repos
- User asks to check CI/CD status or workflow runs
- User asks to call the GitHub API via `gh api`
- User asks to manage GitHub Actions secrets or variables

## Prerequisites

1. **Install:** `brew install gh` or see https://cli.github.com
2. **Auth:** `gh auth login`
3. **Verify:** `gh --version` (requires v2.86+)
4. **Scopes:** `gh auth status` — confirm `repo`, `read:org` scopes minimum

## Safety Model

Every `gh` command falls into one of four risk tiers:

| Tier | Action Required | Examples |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Safe** | Execute immediately | `gh pr list`, `gh issue view`, `gh repo view` |
| **Write** | Inform user, then execute | `gh pr create`, `gh issue create`, `gh release create` |
| **Destructive** | `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE executing | `gh pr merge`, `gh pr close`, `gh release delete` |
| **Forbidden** | Multi-step validation, NEVER auto-confirm | `gh repo delete`, `gh repo transfer`, visibility changes |

See [references/safety-rules.md](references/safety-rules.md) for the full classification and confirmation templates.

## Decision Flow

```
Command received
  → Classify risk tier (see Quick Reference)
  → Safe?        Execute immediately
  → Write?       Inform user what will happen → execute
  → Destructive? AskUserQuestion with options → wait for answer → execute or cancel
  → Forbidden?   Warn → require typed confirmation → final confirm → execute or cancel
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Pull Requests

```bash
# List open PRs
gh pr list

# Create PR (Write — inform user first)
gh pr create --title "feat: add auth" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Add JWT authentication middleware

## Test plan
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Manual login flow verified
EOF
)"

# View PR with checks
gh pr view 42
gh pr checks 42

# Merge PR (Destructive — AskUserQuestion first)
gh pr merge 42 --squash --delete-branch
```

### Issues

```bash
# List issues with filters
gh issue list --label bug --assignee @me
gh issue list --state closed --limit 10

# Create issue (Write)
gh issue create --title "Bug: login fails" --body "Steps to reproduce..." --label bug

# View issue
gh issue view 123

# Close issue (Destructive — confirm first)
gh issue close 123 --reason completed
```

### Releases

```bash
# List releases
gh release list

# Create release (Write — inform user)
gh release create v1.2.0 --generate-notes --title "v1.2.0"

# Create release with assets
gh release create v1.2.0 ./dist/*.tar.gz --title "v1.2.0" --notes "Release notes here"

# Delete release (Destructive — confirm first)
gh release delete v1.2.0
```

### CI/CD & Actions

```bash
# List recent runs
gh run list --limit 10

# View specific run
gh run view 12345

# View logs for failed run
gh run view 12345 --log-failed

# Re-run failed jobs (Write)
gh run rerun 12345 --failed

# Cancel running workflow (Destructive — confirm)
gh run cancel 12345

# Manage secrets (Write for set, Destructive for delete)
gh secret set API_KEY --body "sk-..."
gh secret list
```

### Repository

```bash
# View repo info
gh repo view

# Create repo (Write)
gh repo create my-app --public --clone

# Clone
gh repo clone owner/repo

# Fork (Write)
gh repo fork owner/repo --clone

# Archive (Destructive — confirm first)
gh repo archive owner/repo
```

### API

```bash
# GET (Safe)
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls
gh api repos/owner/repo/issues/123/comments

# POST (Write)
gh api repos/owner/repo/issues -f title="Bug" -f body="Description"

# DELETE (Destructive — confirm first)
gh api repos/owner/repo/issues/123/labels/bug -X DELETE
```

## AskUserQuestion Integration

For **Destructive** operations, use `AskUserQuestion` with tailored options:

### PR Merge Example

```
Question: "How should PR #42 'feat: add auth' be merged?"
Options:
  - "Squash and merge" — Combine all commits into one
  - "Create merge commit" — Preserve commit history
  - "Rebase and merge" — Rebase onto base branch
  - "Cancel" — Do not merge
```

### PR/Issue Close Example

```
Question: "Close PR #42 'feat: add auth'?"
Options:
  - "Close only" — Close without deleting branch
  - "Close and delete branch" — Close PR and remove source branch
  - "Cancel" — Keep open
```

### Delete Example

```
Question: "Delete release v1.2.0?"
Options:
  - "Delete release only" — Keep the git tag
  - "Delete release and tag" — Remove both release and git tag
  - "Cancel" — Keep release
```

For **Forbidden** operations, follow the triple-confirmation protocol in [references/safety-rules.md](references/safety-rules.md).

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `gh: command not found` | Not installed | `brew install gh` |
| `authentication required` | Not logged in | `gh auth login` |
| `HTTP 403` | Insufficient scopes | `gh auth refresh -s scope` |
| `HTTP 404` | Repo not found or no access | Check repo name and permissions |
| `HTTP 422` | Validation failed | Check required fields, branch exists |
| `HTTP 409` | Merge conflict | Resolve conflicts first |
| `HTTP 429` | Rate limited | Wait, or use `--limit` to reduce calls |
| `GraphQL: ...` | API query error | Check field names and types |

## CLI Flags Reference

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json fields` | Output specific JSON fields |
| `--jq expr` | Filter JSON with jq expressions |
| `--template tmpl` | Format output with Go templates |
| `-R owner/repo` | Target a different repo |
| `--limit N` | Limit results |
| `--state open\|closed\|all` | Filter by state |
| `--label name` | Filter by label |
| `--assignee user` | Filter by assignee |
| `--author user` | Filter by author |
| `--web` | Open in browser |

## Shell Safety

- **No interactive mode:** Never use `-i` or `--interactive` flags
- **No pagers:** Always pipe to `cat` if output may trigger a pager: `gh pr list | cat`
- **Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for commands that could hang
- **Quote arguments:** Always quote multi-word arguments and heredoc bodies
- **Never pass `--yes`** to forbidden operations — always require explicit confirmation

## Integration

Pairs with:
- **code-quality** — Review code before PR creation
- **brainstorm** — Design features before opening issues
- **codex-cli** — Second-opinion audit before merging PRs
- **gemini-cli** — Alternative AI review for PR changes
