description: Designs products around price using the 9 rules from Ramanujam and Tacke - WTP conversations, needs-based segmentation, Good/Better/Best configuration, monetization models, behavioral pricing, and price integrity. Use when designing new products, validating pricing for SaaS/B2B/B2C launches, choosing between subscription/usage/freemium models, fixing post-launch sales below plan, diagnosing failed launches as Feature Shock/Minivation/Hidden Gem/Undead, or when product teams say 'let's price it later'. Not for pure commodities or cost-plus regulated environments. Use when this capability is needed.

# Monetizing Innovation

> "Design the product around the price." - Ramanujam & Tacke

## Core Insight

**72% of new products fail** (Simon-Kucher 2014, n=1,615). Root cause: pricing is decided LAST instead of designing the product around it. This figure comes from Simon-Kucher's own client survey data and has not been independently verified. The authors are principals at Simon-Kucher, a pricing consultancy - the stat motivates hiring firms like theirs. Treat it as directionally correct but not independently validated.

| Old paradigm | New paradigm |
|--------------|--------------|
| design → build → market → price | market & price → design → build |

Only ~5% of business cases include real WTP (willingness-to-pay) data. Most companies wait until weeks before launch to set price.

## The 4 Failure Types (Diagnose Before Fixing)

| Failure | Definition | Cultural Cause | Tell-Tale Signs |
|---------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Feature Shock** | Cram too many features → confusing, overpriced | Engineering-driven | Can't articulate value; price slashed post-launch |
| **Minivation** | Right product, priced too low | Risk-averse | Sales easily hits target; sellouts; channel maxes margin |
| **Hidden Gem** | Great idea never properly launched | Coddles core business | Mid-level execs kill it; sold as deal sweetener; rival ships first |
| **Undead** | Wrong answer (or no question asked) | Top-down, no dissent | Sales avoid raising it; pet project of senior management |

**Real examples:** Amazon Fire Phone (Feature Shock, $170M write-down), Audi Q7 (Minivation, missed €210M/yr), Kodak digital camera 1974 (Hidden Gem), Segway/Google Glass (Undead).

## The 5 Pricing Myths (Counter These)

1. "Build it and they will come" - hides 95% of failures
2. "Innovation needs isolated artists" - customer input informs, doesn't pollute
3. "High failure rates are normal" - failure is preventable
4. "Customers must experience product to price it" - false, they react to concepts
5. "You can't price what you haven't built" - cost-plus thinking; price is set by VALUE

## The 9 Rules (Summary)

| # | Rule | Headline |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | **WTP Talk Early** | 80% of companies skip this. Have it before design freezes. |
| 2 | **Needs-Based Segmentation** | Demographic segmentation is broken. Segment by needs/value/WTP. |
| 3 | **Configuration & Bundling** | Use Leaders/Fillers/Killers + Good/Better/Best with FENCES. |
| 4 | **How You Charge > What You Charge** | Choose the right monetization model (5 options). |
| 5 | **Pricing Strategy** | Maximization / Penetration / Skimming. Apply the BECAUSE test. |
| 6 | **Living Business Case** | Link Price-Value-Volume-Cost. Update at every milestone. |
| 7 | **Value Communication** | Sell benefits, not features. Use MOCA matrix. |
| 8 | **Behavioral Pricing** | 6 tactics: compromise, anchoring, signals, razor-blade, pennies-a-day, thresholds. |
| 9 | **Maintain Price Integrity** | Don't cut after launch. Use 3 nonprice actions first. |

## Critical Frameworks (At-a-Glance)

### Leaders / Fillers / Killers

| Type | Definition | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Leader** | Drives buying, high WTP | Always include |
| **Filler** | Nice-to-have | Use to fill gaps |
| **Killer** | Blows the deal if forced to pay | Eliminate or sell à la carte |

Killer test: valued by <20% of customers AND not valued at all by >20%. Killers are segment-dependent (heated seats: leader in cold, killer in tropical).

### Good/Better/Best Distribution

| Distribution | Diagnosis |
|--------------|-----------|
| ≤25% Good, ~70% Better+Best, ≥10% Best | Healthy |
| >50% Good | Trip-wire: cut features from Good |
| Best <10% | Premium tier underpowered |

**Fences are mandatory.** Every tier needs visible, defensible differences. Without fences G/B/B cannibalizes itself. Fence test: in 10 seconds can a customer see what's missing from Good?

### The 5 Monetization Models

| Model | When to Use | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Subscription** | Continual usage | Netflix, Adobe |
| **Dynamic Pricing** | Volatile demand or constrained supply | Uber, airlines |
| **Auctions** | Seller's market, constrained inventory | Google AdWords ($35B/yr), eBay |
| **Pay-As-You-Go / Alternative Metric** | Usage tracks value | Michelin (per-mile), GE engines |
| **Freemium** | Near-zero production AND fixed cost | LinkedIn, Dropbox |

**Freemium warning:** fails for 90% of companies; software conversion typically <10%; games lose 75% of users in day 1.

Models are mix-and-matchable (Costco = subscription + per-product; OpenTable = subscription + transaction fee).

### The 6 Behavioral Pricing Tactics

1. **Compromise effect** - always have 3 tiers; people avoid extremes
2. **Anchoring** - The Economist test: $59 vs $125 vs $125-print-only made bundle pick rate jump 32% → 84%
3. **Price signals quality** - Ariely placebo: $2.50 pill 85% pain relief, $0.10 same pill 61%
4. **Razor / razor blades** - low upfront preferred even if total cost identical
5. **Pennies-a-day** - $9.99/mo converts very differently from $120/yr
6. **Psychological thresholds** - $69.99 works, $71 doesn't (drops acceptance >20%)

**Caveat:** can't price purely on behavior. Combine with rational/value-based.

## Decision Trees

### "Is my product likely to fail?"

```
Can I clearly state the customer benefit (not features)?
├─ NO  → Likely Feature Shock
└─ YES → Has WTP been validated with real customers?
         ├─ NO  → Could be Undead or Minivation
         └─ YES → Did C-suite engage personally?
                  ├─ NO  → Likely Hidden Gem (won't get launched right)
                  └─ YES → On the right track
```

### "Which monetization model?"

```
Is value tied to usage?
├─ YES → Alternative Metric (Michelin model)
└─ NO  → Demand volatile or supply constrained?
        ├─ YES → Dynamic Pricing
        └─ NO  → Production cost near zero?
                ├─ YES → Freemium (only if 90% of users still profitable)
                └─ NO  → Subscription or per-unit
```

### "Should I cut the price?"

```
Sales below plan?
└─ YES → Identified ROOT CAUSE?
         ├─ NO  → Diagnose first (likely not price)
         └─ YES → Pricing-specific?
                  ├─ NO  → Fix actual problem
                  └─ YES → Tried 3 nonprice actions?
                           ├─ NO  → Try those (advertise; add value; upgrade)
                           └─ YES → War-game competitor reaction
                                    └─ Worse off after counter? → don't cut
```

## Critical Numbers

| Number | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **72%** | New products fail |
| **80%** | Companies wait until just before launch to set price |
| **5%** | Business cases include real WTP data |
| **3-4** | Ideal starting number of segments |
| **<10%** | Killer features valued by less than this % |
| **9 / 4** | Max benefits / products before psychological overload |
| **≤25% / 70% / ≥10%** | G/B/B target (Good / Better+Best / Best) |
| **50%** | Trip-wire: more than this picking Good = bleeding |
| **20-30%** | Healthy deal escalation rate |
| **30-40%** | Of ALL DEALS should have price changes upon escalation |
| **3** | Nonprice actions required before any price cut |
| **40%** | More likely to realize potential with defined pricing strategy |
| **33%** | More profit when C-suite leads pricing (vs delegates) - also from Simon-Kucher client data; same provenance caveat as the 72% figure applies |
| **25%** | Of customer interview questions should be "Why?" |

---

## The "BECAUSE" Test

Every pricing decision must end with a "because" traceable to customer data.

**Bad:** "We priced at $99 to be competitive."
**Good:** "We priced at $99 BECAUSE 60% of segment B told us $100 was the threshold above which they'd reconsider, and our value advantage justifies the high end."

If you can't say "because customers told us X," you don't have a pricing strategy.

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before designing a new product:
- [ ] WTP conversations with real customers held
- [ ] Segmented by needs/value/WTP (not demographics)
- [ ] Leaders, fillers, killers identified
- [ ] G/B/B configuration designed with FENCES
- [ ] Monetization model picked (aligns with value)
- [ ] Pricing strategy documented (max/penetration/skimming)
- [ ] Living business case links Price/Value/Volume/Cost
- [ ] Benefit-not-feature messaging tested
- [ ] Behavioral tactics considered
- [ ] Team prepared to maintain price integrity post-launch

**The test:** Ask anyone "Why this price?" If the answer is "cost-plus" or "competitor benchmark," failure is coming.

## When This Doesn't Apply

- Pure cost-plus regulated environments (utilities, some defense)
- Pure commodities (sugar, copper)
- Very early stage with no product (use Mom Test first)
- B2C impulse buys under $50 (simpler approaches work)
- Geographic markets with no purchasing power

---

## Caveat on WTP Research

Stated WTP and revealed WTP differ. Customers predict their own behavior poorly in interviews. Treat WTP findings as a strong prior, not certainty. Validate with paid pilots, pre-orders, live A/B price tests, or money-back guarantees. See [integration.md](integration.md#wtp-research-limitations).
