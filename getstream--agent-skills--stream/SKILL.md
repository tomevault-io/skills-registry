description: Stream router for Chat, Video, Feeds, and Moderation. Use when the user wants to build a new app with Stream, scaffold a project, add Chat/Video/Feeds/Moderation to an existing app, integrate Stream, build for Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit/iOS/Xcode, query Stream data, list channels, list calls, show flagged messages, find users, run stream api / stream config / stream auth commands, install the Stream CLI, set up Stream, search Stream SDK documentation, look up Stream React/iOS/Android/Node/Flutter/Unity SDK methods, ask how-to questions about Stream hooks/components/methods, configure moderation blocklists or automod, set up webhooks, or anything tagged Chat React, Video iOS, Feeds Node, Moderation, etc. Routes to the right sub-skill based on the task. Use when this capability is needed.

# Stream - skill router

This skill picks the track from the user's input and delegates to a specialized sub-skill. **It does no scaffolding, CLI, or docs work itself** - those live in dedicated skills.

> **Read first:** [`RULES.md`](RULES.md). Non-negotiable rules apply, including the **Peer skills** procedure (Glob path + install command + install policy + Skill-vs-Read-inline rule).
>
> **Peer manifest:** [`peers.yaml`](peers.yaml) (schema: [`peers.schema.json`](peers.schema.json)) is the single source of truth for peer skill names, Glob paths, install commands, and routing signals. Every peer installs silently on demand. Read it before installing or routing to a peer.
>
> **After picking a sub-skill:** follow the procedure in RULES.md > Peer skills - Glob the entry's `SKILL.md` path, install it if missing (always silently - every peer is silent-install), then Skill tool (if listed) or Read inline. Do not call `Skill` before the Glob; it surfaces a confusing "Unknown skill" error. Do not stop after naming the track.

## By task

**Build or integrate Stream in a platform-specific app** -> peer pack from [`peers.yaml`](peers.yaml) (**check peer signals first**)
- Match user input or cwd against each peer's `signals` (e.g. `swift` / `swiftui` / `.xcodeproj` -> `stream-swift`; `react native` / `expo` / `stream video react native` -> `stream-react-native`)
- All peers install silently on demand - install if missing, then route, no prompt
- **Peer signals take precedence over the `stream-builder` rows below.** A request like "add a video call to my Expo app" or "scaffold a React Native app with Stream Video" matches `stream-react-native`, not `stream-builder` - the platform token wins.

**Build / enhance / audit / migrate a web app with Stream (React / Next.js)** -> use the `stream-react` skill (the default web pack when no other platform signal is present)
- "build me a Chat/Video/Feeds app", "scaffold", "create a new ...", "add Chat to this app", "integrate Video", "drop Feeds into ...", "upgrade/migrate ... to vN" - and **no platform signal** (no `react native`, `expo`, `swift`, `ios`, `android`, etc.)
- React / Next.js tokens (`stream-chat-react`, `@stream-io/video-react-sdk`, `useCreateChatClient`, `MessageList`, ...) with a build/integrate verb also route here
- Covers Track A (scaffold, Steps 0-7), Track E (enhance an existing project), Track F (read-only best-practices audit), Track M (migrate/upgrade an SDK version)

**Build with the framework-agnostic builder** -> use the `stream-builder` skill **only when the user names it explicitly** ("use stream-builder", "/stream-builder")
- `stream-builder` is the generic builder being extended to other app kinds; web React/Next.js defaults to `stream-react` above

**Audit/review an existing Stream Video integration against best practices** (read-only - no scaffolding, no CLI, no build steps)
- Peer signal (`react native` / `expo`) -> `stream-react-native`; web / React / Next.js or no platform signal -> `stream-react` (Track F)
- **Video only.** The dedicated best-practices audit covers Stream **Video**. Chat/Feeds have no dedicated audit checklist yet - `stream-react` handles those requests with a general docs-based review and says so up front.
- Triggers: "audit/review my video integration", "is my video app production-ready?", "what am I missing before launch?"
- Routes here even when the request contains "check" - the audit intent takes precedence over the `stream-cli` "check {anything}" route below

**Query Stream data via the CLI** -> use the `stream-cli` skill
- "list calls", "show channels", "any flagged", "find users"
- Literal CLI: `stream api ...`, `stream config ...`, `stream auth ...`
- Tricky bodies and filter syntax live in the sub-skill's cookbook
- **Required for every `stream api` call** - including ad-hoc "let me check" queries from inside other sub-skills. No guessing endpoint names from training data; route through `stream-cli` (or read `~/.stream/cache/API.md`) first. See [`RULES.md`](RULES.md) > CLI safety.

**Install the Stream CLI** -> use the `stream-cli` skill
- "install the CLI", "set up stream" with no project context
- Bootstrap (binary install, SHA-256 verification, TTY confirmation) ships with the CLI sub-skill

**Search Stream SDK documentation** -> use the `stream-docs` skill
- "docs", "documentation", explicit SDK token (`Chat React`, `Video iOS`, `Feeds Node`, `Moderation`)
- "how do I ... in <framework>", "how does <hook/component/method> work?", "what does <SDK thing> do?"
- No CLI needed - answers come from getstream.io with citations

## Pick a track

Scan the user's input for the signals below in order. The classifier is deterministic - no probes, no fetches, no CLI checks at this stage.

| Signal in user input | Sub-skill |
|---|---|
| **Upgrade / migrate an installed SDK** (build/integrate intent - matched **before** the docs rows): "upgrade/migrate/bump/update `stream-chat-react` to vN", "migrate to the new SDK version", "bump my Stream version" - an upgrade verb (`upgrade`/`migrate`/`bump`/`update`) + a Stream package token, **no peer signal**. Peer signal (`react native` / `expo` / an `@stream-io/*-react-native-*` token) -> `stream-react-native` instead (its own migration flow). | `stream-react` (Track M) |
| **Audit/review an existing integration** (read-only - matched **before** the SDK-token / docs rows below): "audit/review my video integration", "audit my Chat React integration", "review my Video React app", "is my video app production-ready?", "what am I missing before launch?" - audit/review intent **even when an SDK token like `Chat React` / `Video React` is present**. Peer signal (`react native` / `expo`) -> `stream-react-native`; web / React / Next.js or no platform signal -> `stream-react` (Track F - Video has a **dedicated checklist**; Chat/Feeds get a general docs-based review, stated up front). **Also wins over the `stream-cli` "check {anything}" row below** whenever the request frames a best-practices / production-readiness review rather than a data query. | matching platform pack (read-only audit) |
| Explicit SDK/framework token: `Chat React`, `Video iOS`, `Feeds Node`, `Moderation`, etc. (with or without version), and **no build/integrate verb and no audit/review intent** (`upgrade`/`migrate`/`bump`/`update` count as build/integrate verbs -> migration row above; "audit/review" -> audit row above) | `stream-docs` |
| Words "docs" or "documentation" (and no build/integrate verb) | `stream-docs` |
| "How do I {X} in {framework}?", "How does {hook/component/method} work?", "What does {SDK thing} do?" - and **no build/integrate verb**. If the request is "how do I add/build/integrate/scaffold {X} in {framework}" and `{framework}` matches a peer signal, the peer row below wins instead. | `stream-docs` |
| Operational verbs + Stream noun: "list calls", "show channels", "any flagged", "find users", "check {anything}" | `stream-cli` |
| `stream api`, `stream config`, `stream auth` (literal CLI invocation) | `stream-cli` |
| "Install the CLI", "set up stream" with no project context | `stream-cli` |
| **Build/integration intent + a token matching a peer's `signals` in [`peers.yaml`](peers.yaml)** (e.g. `swift` / `.xcodeproj` -> `stream-swift`; `react native` / `expo` / `stream video react native` / `stream video rn` -> `stream-react-native`). **This row takes precedence over the web `stream-react` rows below whenever a peer signal is present, and also wins over the docs how-to rows above whenever the request contains a build/integrate verb (`add`, `build`, `integrate`, `scaffold`, `wire`, `set up`, `create`, `upgrade`, `migrate`, `bump`, `update`) alongside the peer signal.** Note: `react native` / `react-native` (and `@stream-io/*-react-native-*` tokens) are `stream-react-native` signals and win over the web `react` default - including for upgrade/migrate/update requests, which the RN pack handles itself. | matching peer (installed silently if missing) |
| **Literal mention of `stream-builder` / `/stream-builder`** (the framework-agnostic builder) | `stream-builder` |
| "Build me a ... app", "scaffold", "create a new ..." + Stream product, OR a React/Next.js token (`stream-chat-react`, `@stream-io/video-react-sdk`, `useCreateChatClient`, ...) + build/integrate verb, **and no peer signal present** | `stream-react` (web/Next.js, the default when no platform signal is given) |
| "Add Chat/Video/Feeds to this app", "integrate Stream into", "upgrade/migrate ... to vN" - existing project, **and no peer signal present** | `stream-react` (web/Next.js, the default when no platform signal is given) |
| Operational verb wrapped in how-to phrasing (e.g. "how do I list my calls?" - docs *or* CLI) | **Ask one disambiguator** |

**Preflight carve-outs.** `stream-docs` answers from documentation only - no preflight, no shell commands, no project inspection. **Read-only / local-only tracks also skip preflight:** a platform pack's **audit** track (e.g. `stream-react` Track F) and **migrate** track (e.g. `stream-react` Track M) only inspect/edit local files and the live docs - they do **not** provision orgs/apps or call `stream api`, so they need no CLI, auth, or preflight. Only **build/integrate** work (scaffold a new app, add a product to an existing one) runs preflight before doing real work.

**Docs vs platform packs.** A pure how-to or method-lookup question about an iOS/Android/etc. SDK symbol stays in `stream-docs` - don't pull in a platform pack for a documentation answer. Platform packs (e.g. `stream-swift`) are for *building or integrating* - scaffolding projects, wiring packages, generating views.

**React framework scope.** `stream-react` scaffolds (Track A) a **Next.js** app. For enhance / audit / migrate on a **non-Next.js** React project (Vite, CRA, Remix, TanStack Start, etc.) `stream-react` still owns it - the Stream SDK wiring is identical - but the agent must adapt the Next.js-specific bits: the server-side token route lives in the project's own backend (not a Next.js `/api` route), and verification uses the project's build command (`npm run build`), not `next build`. Never assume Next.js APIs on a non-Next project.

**Disambiguator.** If the input fits more than one row (typically operational verb + how-to phrasing), ask one short question and wait. Don't probe before the answer:

> Want me to look up the SDK method (docs) or run it now via CLI?

After the answer, route as if the user had given that signal directly.

**Bare `/stream` with no args.** Render the menu under "Quick navigation" **verbatim**, then wait for input. No shell execution, no probing, no install.

---

## Quick navigation

For a bare `/stream` (and whenever the user wants to pick a skill directly), output the block below **verbatim** - keep the Core / Platform SDKs split, the examples, and the closing line - then wait:

> **Stream** - Chat - Video - Feeds - Moderation. Tell me what you want, or pick a skill directly:
>
> **Core**
> - `/stream-react` - scaffold, enhance, audit, or migrate a React / Next.js web app with Stream (the default for web) - e.g. *"build me a chat app"*
> - `/stream-cli` - query data, run `stream api / config / auth`, install the CLI - e.g. *"list my channels"*
> - `/stream-docs` - search live SDK docs, with citations - e.g. *"how does useChannel work?"*
> - `/stream-builder` - the framework-agnostic builder (web defaults to `/stream-react`; pick this only if you name it explicitly)
>
> **Platform SDKs**
> - `/stream-swift` - Swift - SwiftUI - UIKit - iOS
> - `/stream-android` - Android - Jetpack Compose - Kotlin
> - `/stream-react-native` - React Native - Expo
> - `/stream-flutter` - build or integrate Stream Chat into a Flutter app (install confirmed first)
>
> New to a skill? Just describe the task - I'll install the right one automatically.

The closing line is load-bearing: typing an uninstalled slash command errors with "Unknown skill" *before* this router runs, so natural-language description is the only dead-end-proof path - it routes here and the missing peer is installed per [`peers.yaml`](peers.yaml). Keep this menu in sync with `peers.yaml`: every peer there appears here under Core or Platform SDKs, and new platforms get a bullet under Platform SDKs when their entry is added.

## Hand-off

See preamble: install if missing, invoke via `Skill` tool, don't stop. Cross-cutting rules in [`RULES.md`](RULES.md) apply to every sub-skill, including **Cross-track follow-ups** (offer, don't auto-execute, the natural next action across track boundaries).
