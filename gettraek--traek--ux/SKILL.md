# UX Design Skill

## Overview

This skill guides Claude to operate as a top 0.001% UX designer with exceptional attention to UI detail, accessibility, usability, and clean design patterns.

## Core Principles

### 1. Accessibility First

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum** - strive for AAA where possible
- Color contrast ratios: minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Keyboard navigation: all interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Screen reader support: proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, meaningful alt text
- Focus indicators: visible, high-contrast focus states on all interactive elements
- Touch targets: minimum 44×44px for mobile, 24×24px for desktop
- Motion sensitivity: respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

### 2. Visual Hierarchy & Typography

- Establish clear typographic scale (typically 12px, 14px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 48px)
- Use font weights strategically (400 regular, 500 medium, 600 semibold, 700 bold)
- Line height: 1.5 for body text, 1.2-1.3 for headings
- Measure (line length): 60-75 characters for optimal readability
- Vertical rhythm: consistent spacing units (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)

### 3. Color System

```bash
Primary: Brand identity, CTAs
Secondary: Supporting actions
Neutral: Text, borders, backgrounds (8-10 shades)
Semantic: Success, Warning, Error, Info
```

- Use HSL for easier manipulation and consistency
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds
- Avoid color as the only means of conveying information

### 4. Spacing & Layout

- Use a consistent spacing scale (multiples of 4 or 8)
- White space is a design element - embrace it
- Grid systems: 12-column for flexibility
- Container max-widths: 1280px-1440px typical
- Responsive breakpoints: 640px (sm), 768px (md), 1024px (lg), 1280px (xl)

### 5. Component Design Patterns

#### Buttons

```bash
Primary: High emphasis, main action
Secondary: Medium emphasis
Tertiary/Ghost: Low emphasis
Destructive: Red/warning for dangerous actions

States: Default, Hover, Active, Focus, Disabled, Loading
Sizes: sm (32px), md (40px), lg (48px) heights
```

#### Forms

- Labels above inputs (better for mobile, translation, accessibility)
- Helper text below fields
- Inline validation with clear error messages
- Group related fields together
- Required field indicators (asterisk or "(required)")
- Placeholder text is NOT a replacement for labels

#### Cards

- Consistent padding (16px-24px)
- Subtle shadows for elevation
- Border radius: 8px-16px for modern feel
- Hover states for interactive cards
- Clear content hierarchy within cards

#### Modals/Dialogs

- Backdrop overlay (rgba(0,0,0,0.5))
- Centered, max-width 600px typically
- Close button (top-right) + ESC key support
- Focus trap within modal
- Return focus to trigger element on close
- Prevent body scroll when open

#### Navigation

- Max 7 main items (Miller's Law)
- Active state clearly differentiated
- Mobile: hamburger menu with full-screen overlay
- Sticky/fixed navigation considered carefully (can reduce viewport)

### 6. Interaction Design

#### Micro-interactions

- Button press: subtle scale (0.98) or shadow change
- Loading states: spinners, skeleton screens, progress indicators
- Transitions: 150ms-300ms typical, ease-in-out
- Hover states: cursor changes, background/text color shifts
- Empty states: helpful, guiding illustrations and text

#### Feedback

- Success: green checkmark, success message
- Error: red, clear explanation, how to fix
- Loading: skeleton screens > spinners for better perceived performance
- Toasts/Notifications: auto-dismiss in 3-5 seconds for info, manual dismiss for errors

### 7. Mobile-First Approach

- Design for smallest screen first, enhance for larger
- Touch-friendly tap targets (44×44px minimum)
- Avoid hover-dependent interactions
- Thumb-zone optimization (bottom 2/3 of screen)
- Consider one-handed use patterns

### 8. Performance & UX

- Perceived performance > actual performance
- Skeleton screens while loading
- Lazy load images below fold
- Instant feedback on interactions
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate

### 9. Reusability & Modularity

#### Design Tokens

```typescript
// colors.ts
export const colors = {
  primary: {
    50: '#f0f9ff',
    500: '#3b82f6',
    900: '#1e3a8a'
  }
  // ...
};

// spacing.ts
export const spacing = {
  xs: '4px',
  sm: '8px',
  md: '16px',
  lg: '24px',
  xl: '32px'
};
```

#### Component Architecture

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Props for customization
- Slots for content composition
- Variants for different use cases
- Consistent API across similar components

### 10. Content Strategy

- Write in active voice
- Use sentence case for UI text (not Title Case)
- Button labels: verb-first ("Save changes" not "Changes save")
- Error messages: explain what happened + how to fix
- Empty states: explain why empty + clear next action
- Avoid jargon, use plain language

## Implementation Checklist

When creating a component or design:

### Visual Design

- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy established
- [ ] Consistent spacing scale used
- [ ] Typography scale applied
- [ ] Color contrast verified (use contrast checker)
- [ ] Focus states visible and clear

### Accessibility

- [ ] Semantic HTML used
- [ ] ARIA labels where needed
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Color not sole information carrier
- [ ] Alt text for images
- [ ] Form labels properly associated

### Responsive

- [ ] Mobile layout considered first
- [ ] Touch targets adequate size
- [ ] Works on 320px width minimum
- [ ] Tested at multiple breakpoints

### Interaction

- [ ] Loading states defined
- [ ] Error states designed
- [ ] Empty states included
- [ ] Success feedback clear
- [ ] Disabled states visible

### Code Quality

- [ ] Reusable component structure
- [ ] Props clearly defined
- [ ] Variants supported
- [ ] Clean, readable code
- [ ] Comments for complex logic

## Common Patterns

### Modal Example Structure

```typescript
<dialog role="dialog" aria-modal="true" aria-labelledby="modal-title">
  <div class="modal-backdrop" />
  <div class="modal-content">
    <div class="modal-header">
      <h2 id="modal-title">Modal Title</h2>
      <button aria-label="Close modal">×</button>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <!-- Content -->
    </div>
    <div class="modal-footer">
      <button>Cancel</button>
      <button class="primary">Confirm</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</dialog>
```

### Form Field Pattern

```typescript
<div class="form-field">
  <label for="email">
    Email <span aria-label="required">*</span>
  </label>
  <input
    id="email"
    type="email"
    aria-describedby="email-error email-help"
    aria-invalid="false"
  />
  <div id="email-help" class="help-text">
    We'll never share your email
  </div>
  <div id="email-error" class="error-text" role="alert">
    <!-- Error message if validation fails -->
  </div>
</div>
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**

- Use placeholder as label replacement
- Rely on color alone for information
- Create touch targets smaller than 44×44px
- Use all caps for long text (readability issues)
- Auto-play videos with sound
- Disable form submit buttons (frustrating UX)
- Use tiny font sizes (< 14px for body text)
- Create keyboard traps
- Use low contrast text (gray on gray)
- Hide important actions in hamburger menus on desktop

✅ **Do:**

- Provide clear labels for all form fields
- Use multiple indicators (color + icon + text)
- Make interactive elements obviously clickable
- Use sentence case for better readability
- Require explicit user action for videos
- Show inline validation without disabling submit
- Use readable font sizes (16px+ for body)
- Support full keyboard navigation
- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast minimum
- Keep primary actions visible

## Design Thinking Process

1. **Understand the user need** - What problem are we solving?
2. **Define constraints** - Technical, accessibility, business requirements
3. **Explore patterns** - Research existing solutions, best practices
4. **Sketch concepts** - Low-fidelity explorations
5. **Build prototype** - High-fidelity, interactive
6. **Test & iterate** - User feedback, accessibility audit
7. **Document** - Patterns, tokens, usage guidelines

## Resources to Reference

- WCAG 2.1 Guidelines
- Material Design (for patterns, not necessarily aesthetics)
- Inclusive Components by Heydon Pickering
- Refactoring UI by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger
- Laws of UX (Jakob's Law, Hick's Law, Fitts's Law, etc.)

## Output Expectations

When Claude creates UX/UI work using this skill:

- Code is production-ready, not just a demo
- Accessibility is built-in, not an afterthought
- Responsive behavior is thoughtfully designed
- Components are truly reusable
- Design decisions are intentional and defensible
- Comments explain "why" not just "what"
