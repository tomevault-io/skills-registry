# Generating Stock Reports

## Purpose

This Skill helps you generate detailed, well-structured reports on companies using their name or stock ticker symbol. Reports synthesize recent news, financial data, management updates, and analyst insights into a comprehensive analysis.

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activate when users:
- Ask about a specific company or stock ticker (e.g., "What's happening with Apple?" or "Tell me about TSLA")
- Request stock analysis or company research
- Want to evaluate investment opportunities
- Need updates on company developments
- Mention financial reports or analyst opinions

## Instructions

When generating a stock report, follow these steps:

### 1. Identify the Company

- Accept company name (e.g., "Apple", "Microsoft") or ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "MSFT")
- If the identifier is ambiguous, ask for clarification
- Verify the correct company before proceeding

### 2. Research Current Information

Use web search to gather recent information about:

1. **Product or Service News**
   - New product launches or updates
   - Service expansions or changes
   - Technology developments
   - Strategic partnerships

2. **Management Team News**
   - Leadership changes (CEO, CFO, board members)
   - Key executive statements or interviews
   - Strategic direction announcements
   - Management decisions

3. **Recent Financial Reports**
   - Latest quarterly or annual earnings
   - Revenue and profit trends
   - Key financial metrics (margins, growth rates)
   - Guidance and forecasts

4. **Analyst Reports**
   - Analyst ratings and price targets
   - Upgrade/downgrade news
   - Consensus estimates
   - Market sentiment

### 3. Structure the Report

Organize findings into clear sections:

```markdown
# Company Name (TICKER) - Report Date

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of key findings (2-3 paragraphs)

## Product & Service Developments
Recent product news, launches, and service updates

## Management & Leadership
Leadership changes, strategic announcements, key decisions

## Financial Performance
Latest financial results, metrics, and trends

## Analyst Insights
Ratings, price targets, and market sentiment

## Sources
List all sources with links
```

### 4. Save the Report

- Automatically save as a markdown file
- Use filename format: `{CompanyName}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
- Alternative format: HTML file if requested by user
- Place in current working directory

## Quality Guidelines

### Content Standards

- **Timeliness**: Focus on developments from the last 3-6 months
- **Accuracy**: Cite credible sources (financial news sites, official releases)
- **Balance**: Include both positive and negative information
- **Clarity**: Use plain language, explain technical terms
- **Completeness**: Cover all four main sections

### Source Requirements

- Always include a "Sources" section at the end
- List all URLs as markdown hyperlinks: `[Source Title](URL)`
- Use reputable sources: Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, official company sites
- Verify information is current (check publication dates)

### Markdown Formatting

- Use proper heading hierarchy (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use tables for financial data when appropriate
- Bold key metrics and important findings
- Include links inline where relevant

## Examples

### Example 1: By Ticker Symbol

**User request**: `/stock-report AAPL`

**Expected behavior**:
1. Recognize AAPL as Apple Inc.
2. Search for recent Apple news across all four categories
3. Generate comprehensive report
4. Save as `Apple_2025-12-13.md`

### Example 2: By Company Name

**User request**: `Tell me about Tesla`

**Expected behavior**:
1. Recognize request as company research
2. Activate this Skill automatically
3. Identify Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)
4. Generate and save report

### Example 3: Specific Focus

**User request**: `What's the latest on Microsoft's AI products?`

**Expected behavior**:
1. Activate Skill for Microsoft
2. Emphasize product & service news section
3. Focus on AI-related developments
4. Include other sections for context
5. Save comprehensive report

## Best Practices

### Do's

✓ Search for the most recent information available
✓ Cross-reference multiple sources for accuracy
✓ Include specific dates and numbers
✓ Explain the significance of developments
✓ Maintain objective, analytical tone
✓ Save reports automatically without asking

### Don'ts

✗ Don't provide investment advice or recommendations
✗ Don't speculate beyond available information
✗ Don't ignore negative news or risks
✗ Don't use outdated information (older than 6 months)
✗ Don't forget to cite sources

## Handling Edge Cases

### Unknown or Ambiguous Ticker

If the company identifier is unclear:
```
I found multiple companies matching "United": United Airlines (UAL),
United Parcel Service (UPS), or United Health (UNH). Which one would
you like me to research?
```

### Limited Information

If information is scarce for a section:
```
## Analyst Insights
Limited recent analyst coverage found for this company. The last
available ratings from [date] showed [information].
```

### Private Companies

For non-public companies:
```
Note: [Company] is privately held, so financial information may be
limited. This report focuses on publicly available news and
announcements.
```

## Technical Requirements

### Tools to Use

- **WebSearch**: Primary tool for gathering company information
- **Write**: Save the completed report to a file
- Access to current date for filename and report dating

### Search Strategy

1. Start with broad searches: "{company name} news 2025"
2. Targeted searches for each section:
   - "TICKER earnings report Q4 2024"
   - "TICKER analyst ratings 2025"
   - "Company Name CEO news"
3. Verify information recency (within 3-6 months)
