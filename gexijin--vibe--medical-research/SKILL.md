# Medical Research

## Purpose

This Skill retrieves scientific papers from PubMed and creates accessible, plain-language summaries of current research on any biomedical or life sciences topic. It bridges the gap between complex scientific literature and general understanding.

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activate when users:
- Ask about scientific research on medical topics (e.g., "What's the latest on Alzheimer's treatment?")
- Want to understand current studies on diseases or conditions
- Request information about clinical trials or treatment approaches
- Mention specific research areas (immunotherapy, gene therapy, drug development)
- Ask questions like "summarize research on..." or "what does research say about..."
- Need to understand scientific consensus on health topics

## Instructions

When generating a research summary, follow these steps:

### 1. Identify the Research Query

- Accept natural language queries (e.g., "immunotherapy for breast cancer")
- Clarify if the topic is too broad (e.g., "cancer" → suggest narrowing to specific type)
- Verify spelling of medical terms
- If ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding

### 2. Retrieve Scientific Papers

Use the skill's built-in `pubmed_search.py` script located in `.claude/skills/medical-research/`:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/medical-research/pubmed_search.py "your search query"
```

- Default retrieves 10 most recent papers
- For comprehensive summaries, consider increasing `max_results` in the script
- Capture paper details: titles, authors, abstracts, PMIDs, publication dates

### 3. Analyze and Synthesize Findings

Review the retrieved papers and identify:

1. **Main Research Themes**
   - What are the major topics being studied?
   - What questions are researchers trying to answer?
   - What approaches or methods are common?

2. **Key Findings**
   - What are the main discoveries or results?
   - What treatments or interventions show promise?
   - What mechanisms are being investigated?

3. **Clinical Implications**
   - How might this research affect patient care?
   - What are practical applications?
   - What changes to treatment guidelines might result?

4. **Challenges and Limitations**
   - What problems remain unsolved?
   - What resistance mechanisms exist?
   - What gaps in knowledge persist?

5. **Emerging Directions**
   - What new approaches are being developed?
   - What future research is needed?
   - What technologies are being applied?

### 4. Write Plain-Language Summary

Structure the summary for general audience understanding:

```markdown

## Quality Guidelines

### Content Standards

- **Accessibility**: Write at a 10th-grade reading level
- **Accuracy**: Faithfully represent research findings; don't oversimplify to the point of distortion
- **Balance**: Include both promising developments and challenges
- **Currency**: Focus on papers from the last 1-2 years when possible
- **Context**: Explain why research matters and how it fits into bigger picture
- **Clarity**: Define medical/scientific terms; use analogies when helpful

### Language Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use active voice ("Researchers found..." not "It was found...")
- Define abbreviations on first use (e.g., "TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer)")
- Use concrete examples
- Explain mechanisms in simple terms
- Provide context for numbers and statistics
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts

**Don't:**
- Use jargon without explanation
- Oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy
- Make claims stronger than the research supports
- Provide medical advice
- Use passive voice excessively
- Assume prior knowledge of biology/medicine

### Credibility Standards

- **Objectivity**: Present findings without bias
- **Accuracy**: Cite specific PMIDs and paper details
- **Transparency**: Note when information is limited or preliminary
- **Disclaimers**: Always include educational/non-medical-advice disclaimer
- **Dates**: Include publication years to show currency

## Examples

### Example 1: Treatment Research

## Best Practices

### Do's

✓ Start with broad overview before diving into details
✓ Use subheadings to break up long sections
✓ Include "Key Terminology" section for important terms
✓ Provide specific examples from papers
✓ Explain statistical significance in plain language
✓ Note when findings are preliminary or need replication
✓ Connect research to real-world impact

### Don'ts

✗ Don't recommend specific treatments or medications
✗ Don't use unexplained acronyms (EGFR, VEGF, etc.)
✗ Don't ignore negative findings or failures
✗ Don't exaggerate promises ("cure for cancer")
✗ Don't skip the educational disclaimer
✗ Don't assume readers have science background
✗ Don't make summary too technical

## Handling Edge Cases

### Few or No Papers Found

If PubMed returns few results:
```
The search for "[query]" returned only [N] papers. This may indicate:
1. Very new or emerging research area
2. Query may need refinement
3. Limited research on this specific topic

Would you like me to:
- Try a broader search term?
- Search for related concepts?
- Proceed with available papers?
```

### Highly Technical Results

If papers are extremely technical:
```
Note: This is a highly specialized research area. I've translated
the technical findings into accessible language, but some complexity
is unavoidable. Key terms are defined in the "Key Terminology" section.
```

### Controversial Topics

For topics with conflicting research:
```
## Research Perspectives

Current research shows differing viewpoints:

**Perspective 1**: [Explanation with supporting papers]
**Perspective 2**: [Alternative view with supporting papers]

The scientific community is actively investigating these questions,
and consensus may emerge as more evidence accumulates.
```

### Outdated Research

If most papers are older than 2 years:
```
Note: The most recent papers in this search are from [year]. This
may indicate:
- Established research area with stable findings
- Reduced current research activity
- Search terms may benefit from updating

The summary focuses on foundational findings that remain current.
```

## Technical Requirements

### Tools to Use

- **Bash**: Run the `pubmed_search.py` script
- **Read**: Optionally read papers or abstracts if more detail needed
- **Write**: Save the completed summary to markdown file
- **WebFetch** (optional): Retrieve full papers from PubMed if abstracts insufficient

### Search Strategy

1. **Start specific**: Use precise medical terms
2. **Iterate if needed**: Broaden or narrow based on results
3. **Check paper count**: Aim for 10-20 papers for comprehensive summary
4. **Verify relevance**: Ensure retrieved papers match the query
5. **Note search date**: Document when search was performed

### Script Modifications

If needed, users can modify `pubmed_search.py`:
- Increase `max_results` for more comprehensive reviews
- Update `Entrez.email` with their email address
- Adjust abstract length display

## File Output Specifications

### Default Format: Markdown

```
Filename: Research_Summary_{Topic}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md

Encoding: UTF-8
Sections: All sections from template
```

### Content Requirements

- Minimum 800 words for comprehensive topics
