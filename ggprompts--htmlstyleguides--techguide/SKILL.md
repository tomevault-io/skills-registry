# Build a Tech Guide

Create a comprehensive tech guide for **$ARGUMENTS**.

Follow the full conventions in `techguides/CLAUDE.md`. The guide must be self-contained HTML with inline CSS, Google Fonts only, 1500-4000+ lines, 8-12 numbered sections, sticky jump nav, and responsive design.

## Phase 0 — Plan (interactive)

1. Parse the argument: the first word is the topic (e.g., "xterm.js"), optional second word is the style name (e.g., "celtic").
2. If no style was specified:
   - Read the **Style Guide Catalog** table in `README.md` to see which styles are available (empty Tech Guide column) vs already used
   - Suggest 3-4 unused styles that thematically fit the topic
   - Ask the user to pick one
3. Read the chosen style's HTML file from `styles/{name}.html` to extract the design system (CSS variables, fonts, color palette, component patterns).
4. Read `techguides/CLAUDE.md` for the template and conventions.
5. Read 1-2 existing tech guides (like `python.html` or `docker.html`) to match structure and depth — just skim the first ~100 lines for structure reference.
6. Propose a section outline (8-12 sections) and discuss with the user before proceeding.

## Phase 1 — Research (parallel Sonnet subagents)

Launch 3-4 **sonnet** subagents in parallel to research different topic areas:
- Each subagent should use context7 MCP (`mcp-cli call context7/resolve-library-id` then `mcp-cli call context7/query-docs`) to find the latest documentation
- Each subagent should also use WebSearch for current best practices
- Subagents should cover distinct non-overlapping areas (e.g., for a language: fundamentals, advanced features, ecosystem/frameworks, tooling/testing)
- Each subagent returns a structured summary of key concepts, code examples, and current best practices

## Phase 2 — Build (sequential Opus subagents)

Use 4-5 sequential **opus** subagents, each writing a portion of the guide:

1. **First agent**: Create the full HTML skeleton with the chosen style's CSS adapted for tech guide components (jump nav, section headers, code blocks, tables, alerts, command grids). Write sections 01-03. Include all Google Font links, all CSS, the complete `<head>`, back link, header, jump nav with ALL section links, and the opening sections.
2. **Second agent**: Read the file so far, then append sections 04-06. Must read the existing file first to continue seamlessly.
3. **Third agent**: Read the file so far, then append sections 07-09.
4. **Fourth agent**: Read the file so far, then append sections 10-12 (or however many remain) plus the footer. Close all HTML tags.
5. **Fifth agent (polish)**: Read the complete file. Verify all jump nav anchor links match section IDs. Check for consistency in class names, spacing, and code example formatting. Fix any issues.

**Critical rules for build agents:**
- Each agent MUST read the current file before writing
- Use the Edit tool to append content (find the closing `</body>` or last `</section>` and insert before it)
- Never rewrite the entire file — only append or edit specific sections
- All code examples must use `<pre><code>` blocks
- Every section needs an `id` attribute matching the jump nav anchors
- Include the back link: `<a href="index.html" class="back-link">Tech Guides</a>`

## Phase 3 — Index & Ship

1. Read `techguides/index.html` to understand the card format and tiers.
2. Add a card for the new guide in the appropriate tier:
   - **Tier 1 — Core Tools**: Essential developer tools (git, docker, vim, bash)
   - **Tier 2 — Essential Toolkit**: Common languages/utilities (python, rust, go)
   - **Tier 3 — Infrastructure & Ops**: Server/deployment/architecture
3. Add matching `.card-{style-name}` CSS with colors from the style's palette.
4. Update the guide count in the index header if present.
5. Update the **Style Guide Catalog** table in `README.md` — add the tech guide name in the Tech Guide column for the chosen style.
6. Commit with message: `Add {Topic} tech guide ({style-name} style)`
7. Push using: `git config --global credential.helper store && echo "https://GGPrompts:$(gh auth token --user GGPrompts)@github.com" > ~/.git-credentials && git push origin main`
