# Plugin Development

This skill provides guidance for creating, structuring, and debugging Claude Code plugins.

## When to Use

This skill should be used when:
- Creating a new Claude Code plugin from scratch
- Adding components (commands, agents, skills, hooks, MCP servers) to an existing plugin
- Debugging plugin loading or configuration issues
- Understanding plugin directory structure and manifest format
- Preparing plugins for distribution via marketplaces

## Plugin Overview

A Claude Code plugin is a directory containing:
1. **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** (required) - Plugin manifest with metadata
2. **Component directories** (optional) - `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `.mcp.json`
3. **Scripts and assets** - Supporting files for hooks and utilities

## Creating a Plugin

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json       # REQUIRED - manifest
├── commands/             # Slash commands (.md files)
├── agents/               # Subagents (.md files)
├── skills/               # Agent skills (dirs with SKILL.md)
├── hooks/
│   └── hooks.json        # Hook configurations
├── .mcp.json             # MCP server definitions
└── scripts/              # Utility scripts for hooks
```

### Step 2: Create plugin.json

Minimal manifest:
```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What this plugin does"
}
```

Full manifest - see `references/manifest-schema.md`.

### Step 3: Add Components

**Commands** - Create `commands/name.md`:
```markdown
---
description: Brief description for autocomplete
---

# Command Name

Instructions for the command...
```

**Agents** - Create `agents/name.md`:
```markdown
---
description: What this agent specializes in
capabilities: ["task1", "task2"]
---

# Agent Name

Agent instructions...
```

**Skills** - Create `skills/name/SKILL.md`:
```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: What the skill does
---

# Skill Name

Skill instructions...
```

**Hooks** - Create `hooks/hooks.json` or inline in plugin.json:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lint.sh"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**MCP Servers** - Create `.mcp.json` or inline in plugin.json:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@company/mcp-server"],
      "cwd": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Publishing as a Marketplace

To make your plugin installable via `github:` or `local:` sources, add `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-marketplace",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "my-skill",
      "description": "What it does",
      "source": "./skills/my-skill"
    },
    {
      "name": "full-plugin",
      "description": "Everything in this plugin",
      "source": "./"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Critical:** All `source` paths must start with `./` (e.g., `"./"` not `"."`).

See `references/marketplace-schema.md` for complete schema.

## Critical Rules

1. **`.claude-plugin/` contains ONLY `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`** - All component directories go at plugin root
2. **All paths are relative** - Must start with `./`
3. **Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`** - For absolute paths in hooks/MCP configs
4. **Scripts must be executable** - Run `chmod +x script.sh`

## Debugging

Run `claude --debug` to see:
- Which plugins are loading
- Errors in plugin manifests
- Command, agent, and hook registration
- MCP server initialization

### Common Issues

| Issue                  | Cause                      | Solution                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Plugin not loading     | Invalid plugin.json        | Validate JSON syntax                  |
| Commands not appearing | Wrong directory structure  | Ensure `commands/` at root, not in `.claude-plugin/` |
| Hooks not firing       | Script not executable      | Run `chmod +x script.sh`              |
| MCP server fails       | Missing CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT | Use variable for all plugin paths     |
| Path errors            | Absolute paths used        | All paths must be relative with `./`  |
| "marketplace not found" | Missing marketplace.json   | Add `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` |
| "source must start with ./" | Source path is `"."` not `"./"` | Change to `"./"` for root plugin |
