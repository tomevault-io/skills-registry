# Plain Language Review

Review text files against the U.S. federal government Plain Language Guidelines (~30 rules across 6 categories) and produce a structured report of findings with concrete rewrites.

**Important: This skill produces a report. Do not modify any reviewed files.**

---

## Review Workflow

1. **Select files** — Use the user's specified files. If none specified, run `scripts/scan-plaintext-files.sh <project-directory>` to discover all `.md`, `.mdx`, `.markdown`, `.txt`, `.rtf`, `.rst`, `.adoc`, `.org`, and `.wiki` files. The `<project-directory>` argument is **required** — it must be the root of the user's project (the repository being reviewed), NOT the skill's own directory.
2. **Load rules** — Read `references/rules-quick-ref.md` for the full rule checklist.
3. **Review each file** — For each file, read it and apply all rules. Skip text inside code blocks/fences, inline code, and code-only files. Only review human-readable prose.
4. **Generate findings** — For each issue found, produce a finding using the Output Format below.
5. **Classify severity** — Use `references/severity-rubric.md` to assign high/medium/low.
6. **Verify rewrites** — For each suggested rewrite, confirm it resolves the flagged rule violation and does not introduce new violations. If a rewrite still triggers the same or a different rule, revise it before including it in the report.
7. **Assemble report** — Write findings to `plain-language-findings-YYYYMMDD.md` in the project root (use today's date). Group findings by file, then by severity (high first). End with the summary block.

## Output Format

Use this exact structure for each finding:

```
## [file path]

### Finding [N] — [Rule name] (severity: [high|medium|low])
- **Line [N]:** "[original text]"
- **Guideline:** [One-sentence explanation of the rule violated]
- **Suggested:** "[concrete rewrite]"
```

**Example:**

```
## docs/getting-started.md

### Finding 1 — Use simple words (severity: medium)
- **Line 14:** "In order to utilize the configuration module..."
- **Guideline:** Replace complex words with simple alternatives — "utilize" → "use", "in order to" → "to"
- **Suggested:** "To use the configuration module..."

### Finding 2 — Use active voice (severity: high)
- **Line 23:** "The database will be initialized by the setup script."
- **Guideline:** Make the actor the subject of the sentence
- **Suggested:** "The setup script initializes the database."
```

If a file has no findings, omit it from the report entirely — do not list it.

End the report with a summary:

```
## Summary
- **Files reviewed:** [N]
- **Total findings:** [N] ([N] high, [N] medium, [N] low)
- **Top issues:** [List the 2-3 most frequent rule violations]
```

## When to Load Reference Files

Load references on demand to conserve context:

| File | When to load |
|------|-------------|
| `references/rules-quick-ref.md` | Always — load at start of every review |
| `references/word-substitutions.md` | When checking word choice or when you encounter a word that might have a simpler alternative |
| `references/active-voice-guide.md` | When you detect passive voice patterns (forms of "to be" + past participle) |
| `references/before-and-after-examples.md` | When crafting suggested rewrites — use as transformation models |
| `references/severity-rubric.md` | When classifying findings — consult definitions and examples |

---

## Scope Rules

- **Review:** prose in `.md`, `.mdx`, `.markdown`, `.txt`, `.rtf`, `.rst`, `.adoc`, `.org`, `.wiki` files; comments in source code files; UI strings; error messages
- **Skip:** code inside fences/backticks, variable names, import statements, configuration values, URLs, file paths
- **Preserve technical terms** — flag jargon only when a simpler alternative exists without losing precision
- **Do not modify reviewed files** — produce recommendations only
