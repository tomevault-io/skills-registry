# GitHub Actions

## Quick Start

Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/<name>.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI
on: push
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "Hello World"
```

**Essential concepts:**
- **Workflow**: Automated process defined in YAML, runs in response to events
- **Job**: Set of steps that run on the same runner
- **Step**: Individual action or shell command
- **Action**: Reusable unit of code (GitHub marketplace or custom)
- **Event**: What triggers the workflow (push, pull_request, schedule, etc.)

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Testing**: Run tests on every push/PR
- **Linting**: Code quality checks
- **Building**: Compile code, build artifacts
- See: `references/tutorials/build-and-test-code/`

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **Deploy to production**: Merge to main → deploy
- **Multi-environment**: dev/staging/prod with approvals
- **Blue-green deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments
- See: `references/how-tos/deploy/`

### Scheduled Tasks
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily at midnight
```

### Matrix Builds
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    node: [14, 16, 18]
```

## Workflow Syntax Reference

### Required Structure
- `name`: Workflow name
- `on`: Triggers (events, schedules, manual)
- `jobs`: One or more jobs

### Key Job Fields
- `runs-on`: Runner type (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest, self-hosted)
- `steps`: Sequential list of steps
- `strategy`: Matrix, fail-fast, max-parallel
- `outputs`: Job-to-job data passing

### Key Step Types
```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'Checkout code'
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: 'Run script'
    run: npm test

  - name: 'Use action'
    uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '18'
```

### Complete syntax reference: `references/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax.md`

## Trigger Events

### Common Events
- `push`: Commits pushed to branch
- `pull_request`: PR opened/updated/closed
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger
- `schedule`: Cron-based execution

### Advanced Events
- `release`: Release published
- `workflow_call`: Reusable workflow
- `repository_dispatch`: Webhook-triggered
- `environment`: Environment deployment

**Complete events reference**: `references/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows.md`

## Expressions and Contexts

### Expression Syntax
```yaml
if: github.event_name == 'push'
runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
```

### Common Contexts
- `github`: Event details, repo, actor, ref
- `env`: Environment variables
- `job`: Job status, outputs
- `steps`: Step outputs
- `runner`: Runner OS, architecture
- `secrets`: Encrypted secrets
- `vars`: Custom variables

**Complete expressions reference**: `references/reference/workflows-and-actions/expressions.md`
**Complete contexts reference**: `references/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts.md`

## Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management
```yaml
steps:
  - run: deploy.sh ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```
- Never log secrets (GitHub auto-redacts)
- Use `secrets` context for sensitive data
- Store in repository Settings → Secrets

**Security guide**: `references/concepts/security/secrets.md`

### GITHUB_TOKEN
- Automatically provided authentication
- Scoped permissions for repo access
- Use for repo operations (clone, push, create PR)

**GITHUB_TOKEN reference**: `references/concepts/security/github_token.md`

### OIDC (OpenID Connect)
- Cloud deployments without long-lived credentials
- Supports AWS, Azure, GCP, and more
- Configure OIDC in workflow and cloud provider

**OIDC guide**: `references/concepts/security/openid-connect.md`

### Security Hardening
- Pin action versions (`@v4` not `@main`)
- Require approval for external workflows
- Use artifact attestations for supply chain security

**Security hardening**: `references/how-tos/security-harden-workflows/`

## Reusable Workflows and Actions

### Reusable Workflows
```yaml
# .github/workflows/reusable.yml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      version:
        required: true
        type: string

# Call from another workflow
jobs:
  call:
    uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/reusable.yml@main
    with:
      version: '1.0'
```

### Composite Actions
Combine multiple steps into a reusable action.

### Custom Actions
- JavaScript/TypeScript actions
- Docker actions
- Composite actions

**Reusable workflows**: `references/concepts/workflows-and-actions/reusing-workflow-configurations.md`
**Custom actions**: `references/concepts/workflows-and-actions/custom-actions.md`

## Deployment Patterns

### Environments
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment: production
    environment:
      url: https://example.com
```

### Deployment Protection Rules
- Require approval before production
- Restrict who can deploy
- Wait timers for manual review

### Third-Platform Deployments
- **Azure**: App Service, Kubernetes, Static Web Apps
- **AWS**: ECS, EKS, Lambda
- **GCP**: Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run

**Deployment guides**: `references/how-tos/deploy/`

## Caching Dependencies

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

**Caching reference**: `references/concepts/workflows-and-actions/dependency-caching.md`

## Artifacts and Logs

### Upload Artifacts
```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-output
    path: dist/
```

### Download Artifacts
```yaml
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-output
```

**Artifacts reference**: `references/concepts/workflows-and-actions/workflow-artifacts.md`

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Logging
Add secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` and `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` to repository.

### Common Issues
- **Permission errors**: Check `permissions` scope
- **Path issues**: Use `${{ github.workspace }}`
- **Secret issues**: Verify secret names and scopes

### Viewing Logs
- Actions tab → Workflow run → Job → Step
- Download logs for offline analysis

**Troubleshooting guide**: `references/how-tos/troubleshoot-workflows.md`
