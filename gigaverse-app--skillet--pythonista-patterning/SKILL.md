# Pattern Discovery and Architecture Trust

## Core Philosophy

**Before writing ANY new code, actively search for existing patterns and reuse opportunities.**

Duplicating code with subtle variations is one of the most damaging things you can do to a codebase.

## The Pattern Discovery Workflow

When implementing ANY feature:

### 1. Search for Similar Implementations

```bash
# Search for related code
grep -r "similar_function" src/

# Check sibling files in same directory
ls src/services/

# Look at parallel structures
# If writing campaign_api.py, check drip_api.py, prompt_api.py
```

### 2. Document Patterns Found

- Note the common structure/approach
- Identify what varies vs what stays the same
- List helper functions or utilities used

### 3. Follow Established Patterns Exactly

- Use the same parameter names and types
- Use the same error handling approach
- Use the same validation strategy

### 4. Identify Reuse Opportunities

- Spot duplicated logic that can be extracted
- Find DB queries that appear multiple times
- Notice validation patterns repeated across files

## Balance: Don't Over-Engineer, Don't Under-Engineer

### Under-Engineering (BAD)

```python
# campaign_api.py
async def update_campaign(community_handle: str, campaign: Campaign):
    if campaign.version == 0:
        current = await collection.find_one({"community_handle": community_handle})
        next_version = (current["campaign"]["version"] + 1) if current else 1
        campaign.version = next_version

# drip_api.py - DUPLICATE with subtle variation!
async def update_drip(community_handle: str, drip: Drip):
    if drip.version == 0:
        current = await collection.find_one({"community_handle": community_handle})
        next_version = (current["drip"]["version"] + 1) if current else 1
        drip.version = next_version
```

### Over-Engineering (BAD)

```python
# Creating a generic "VersionedEntityManager" when only 2 entities need it
class VersionedEntityManager(ABC, Generic[T]):
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_current_version(self, handle: str) -> int | None: ...
    # 50+ lines of generic infrastructure for 2 use cases
```

### Right Balance (GOOD)

```python
# Simple, focused helper
async def auto_increment_version(
    collection,
    community_handle: str,
    field_name: str,
    entity: VersionedEntity,
) -> VersionedEntity:
    """Auto-increment version using version=0 sentinel."""
    if entity.version == 0:
        current = await collection.find_one({"community_handle": community_handle})
        current_version = current.get(field_name, {}).get("version", 0) if current else 0
        entity.version = current_version + 1
    return entity

# Usage
campaign = await auto_increment_version(collection, handle, "campaign", campaign)
drip = await auto_increment_version(collection, handle, "drip", drip)
```

## Simple Helper vs Infrastructure

### Simple Helper - Extract Immediately

- Duplicated calculations
- Repeated DB queries (same query in 3+ places)
- Filtering/validation logic repeated across functions
- **Action**: Extract now, include in current PR

### Infrastructure - Ask First

- Affects how multiple components interact
- Introduces new architectural layer
- Changes system structure
- **Action**: Ask user, likely separate PR

## Trust the Architecture

**NEVER duplicate validation that already exists in lower layers.**

### Wrong - Service Layer Blocks API

```python
async def _create_item(self, name, item):
    versions = await api.list_item_versions(make_id(name), include_deleted=False)
    if versions:
        raise ValueError(f"Item '{name}' already exists")  # Blocks API!
    return await api.create_library_item(item, user_id=user_id)
```

### Correct - Service Layer Trusts API

```python
async def _create_item(self, name, item):
    validate_name(name)  # Only validate what service should
    return await api.create_library_item(item, user_id=user_id)  # Let API handle versioning
```

### Before Adding Validation, Ask:

1. Does a lower layer already handle this?
2. What is this layer's responsibility?
3. Am I preventing the lower layer from doing its job?

## Merge Conflicts: Investigate Before Restoring

**ALWAYS investigate WHY code is missing before restoring it.**

```bash
# Check what exists on main
git show main:path/to/file.py | grep -A 20 "function_name"

# Check git log for related changes
git log --oneline --all -- path/to/file.py | head -20
```

### Ask These Questions

1. Was this deletion intentional?
2. What's the new way to accomplish this?
3. Why is the new approach better?
4. Are approaches complementary, competing, or extensible?

## Checklist

Before writing new code:
- [ ] Searched for existing patterns (grep, sibling files, parallel structures)
- [ ] Documented patterns found
- [ ] Following established patterns exactly
- [ ] Identified reuse opportunities
- [ ] Not duplicating validation from lower layers
- [ ] Simple helpers extracted, infrastructure changes discussed
