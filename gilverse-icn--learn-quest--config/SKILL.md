# Learn Quest Configuration Management

The user wants to view or modify Learn Quest settings.

## Configuration File Handling

### File Locations
- **Local storage**: `~/.learn-quest/config.json`
- **Project storage**: `./.learn-quest/config.json`

### If Config File Doesn't Exist

1. **Create the directory** if `~/.learn-quest/` doesn't exist
2. **Create config file** with default values
3. **Notify user**:

```
📝 No configuration found. Created default config at ~/.learn-quest/config.json

Tip: Run /learn-quest:setup for interactive configuration!
```

4. **Continue** with the requested operation using defaults

## Default Values

```json
{
  "level": "silver",
  "language": "en",
  "trigger": {
    "on_code_write": true,
    "on_task_complete": true,
    "on_question": false,
    "on_all": false
  },
  "features": {
    "info": true,
    "direction": true,
    "cs_knowledge": true,
    "quiz": false
  },
  "stash": {
    "enabled": true,
    "prompt_on_complete": true
  },
  "storage": "local"
}
```

### Learning Triggers

Controls **when** learning points are provided. Multiple triggers can be enabled simultaneously.

- **on_code_write**: When Claude writes or modifies code
- **on_task_complete**: When a task or feature is completed
- **on_question**: When Claude answers questions
- **on_all**: Always provide learning points (overrides other triggers)

If all triggers are `false`, learning points are only shown with `/learn-quest:explain`.

### Stash Mode

Save learning points when busy, study them later with `/learn-quest:study`.

- **enabled**: When true, stash features are available
- **prompt_on_complete**: When true, suggests saving after task completion
  - Detects completion signals: "고마워", "됐어", "done", "thanks", etc.
  - Shows: "지금은 바쁘시죠? 학습 포인트만 저장해두고, 나중에 천천히 공부하세요."

## Command Handling
