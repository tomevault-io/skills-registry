# Skill Testing and Validation

## Mission

Operate as an evidence-first testing and validation workflow for skill packages, auxiliary scripts, validators, runners, linters, benchmark tools, packagers, and small multi-language technical projects. Prefer local, repeatable commands and minimal patches over broad rewrites.

This skill does not depend on MCP. Use the filesystem and available terminal/container tools directly. If commands cannot be executed, return a plan and limitations; do not claim validation.

## Core rules

- Establish a baseline before any fix: inspect files, identify commands, run the relevant failing command when possible, and preserve the original failure evidence.
- Never state that build, tests, lint, validators, or packaging passed unless command output or supplied evidence proves it.
- Classify failures before fixing: `build`, `test`, `lint`, `environment`, `configuration`, `packaging`, `validator`, or `unknown`.
- Apply the smallest safe patch that addresses the observed failure. Do not improve unrelated code opportunistically.
- Do not edit `.git`, secrets, credentials, locked paths, benchmark evidence, generated baseline reports, fixtures, golden files, snapshots, expected outputs, or user-declared read-only files unless the user explicitly authorizes that exact path category.
- Do not convert this workflow into generic feature implementation. Stay within tests, validation, command discovery, runners, linters, build/test plumbing, and failure repair.
- Keep measured evidence separate from recommendations and unexecuted plans.

## Mode router

Choose one primary mode, then stage supporting modes only when required by the user's request.

| Mode | Use for | Primary output |
|---|---|---|
| `research-testability` | Analyze structure, languages, test patterns, commands, risks, and gaps | Testability research with command candidates and priorities |
| `plan-tests` | Turn research into phased test/validator work | Phase plan with risks, gates, and priority |
| `generate-tests` | Generate tests, cases, scenario suites, or validator cases | Test/case artifacts or patch plan with assumptions |
| `implement-test-phase` | Implement one named phase from a plan | Minimal file changes plus build/test/lint evidence |
| `run-build` | Discover and execute build/compile command | Build status with command and output summary |
| `run-tests` | Discover and execute test/validator command | Test status with command and failure details |
| `run-lint` | Discover and execute lint/format check | Lint status with command, changed files, or failures |
| `fix-failures` | Repair build/test/lint/validator failures | Baseline, classification, patch, rerun evidence |
| `validation-report` | Summarize evidence after validation work | Command log, results, changed files, residual risk |

## Required inputs

Resolve or conservatively infer these before mutating files:

1. Target root and requested scope.
2. Primary mode from the mode router.
3. Writable paths and blocked paths.
4. Baseline evidence source: command output, supplied log, or static inspection when execution is unavailable.
5. Candidate build, test, lint, validation, and packaging commands.
6. Acceptance gates and final artifact expectation.

Use [`examples/prompt-scenarios.md`](examples/prompt-scenarios.md) for activation, non-activation, ambiguous, and failure examples when behavior is unclear. Use [`evals/activation-scenarios.json`](evals/activation-scenarios.json) as planned activation coverage; do not report scenario metrics unless those prompts were actually executed.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve target and scope

Identify the target root, requested scope, writable paths, blocked paths, language/runtime hints, and final artifact expectation. If the user gave a specific phase, file, command, or package, restrict work to that scope.

### 2. Inspect before editing

For `research-testability`, `plan-tests`, `generate-tests`, `implement-test-phase`, and `fix-failures`, inspect the target before writing files:

- project markers: `SKILL.md`, package.json, pyproject.toml, pytest.ini, tox.ini, Makefile, *.sln, *.csproj, go.mod, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, build.gradle, deno.json, bun.lockb;
- source and tests: tests/, test/, spec/, __tests__/, *.test.*, *.spec.*, *_test.go, test_*.py, *_test.py;
- validators and runners: files under `scripts/`, `bin/`, `tools/`, `evals/`, `benchmarks/`, `validators/`;
- existing command documentation in `README*`, Makefile, package scripts, CI workflows, and skill references.

Use [`scripts/discover_commands.py`](scripts/discover_commands.py) when command discovery needs to be repeatable or reported as JSON.

### 3. Establish baseline evidence

Before applying fixes, run the narrowest relevant command that reproduces the issue. If no command exists, record that the baseline is static inspection only.

Capture:

- exact command;
- working directory;
- exit status;
- relevant stdout/stderr excerpt;
- timestamp if available;
- failure classification.

Use [`scripts/classify_failure.py`](scripts/classify_failure.py) when failure output is long or ambiguous.

### 4. Plan or generate tests

For test generation, follow a research-plan-implement sequence:

1. research structure, commands, existing patterns, testability, and gaps;
2. plan phases by priority, dependency order, complexity, and risk;
3. generate or implement one phase at a time;
4. run build/test/lint gates after each implemented phase when possible.

Load [`references/testability-strategy.md`](references/testability-strategy.md) and [`references/acceptance-criteria.md`](references/acceptance-criteria.md) for detailed planning rules. Use [`assets/templates/testability-research.md.template`](assets/templates/testability-research.md.template) and [`assets/templates/test-plan.md.template`](assets/templates/test-plan.md.template) only when a durable artifact is useful.

### 5. Run commands safely

Prefer project-declared commands over guessed commands. Prefer scoped commands over whole-repository commands when the user requested a narrow scope. Do not install dependencies, alter lockfiles, or run destructive scripts unless explicitly authorized.

Load [`references/command-selection.md`](references/command-selection.md) for command priority, language heuristics, and safe fallbacks.

### 6. Fix failures minimally

For `fix-failures`:

1. baseline the failure;
2. classify it using [`references/failure-classification.md`](references/failure-classification.md);
3. identify the smallest target file set;
4. patch only files needed to address the observed failure;
5. rerun the same command;
6. optionally run adjacent gates, such as lint after test changes or tests after build repair;
7. report accepted, partial, or blocked status.

If a failure indicates missing dependencies, unavailable runtime, permission denial, network restriction, incompatible toolchain, or missing secret/configuration, report `environment` or `configuration` and avoid fabricating a code fix.

### 7. Report evidence

When the requested deliverable is a packaged skill archive, use [`scripts/package_skill.py`](scripts/package_skill.py) only after validation gates pass.


For `validation-report`, use [`assets/templates/validation-report.md.template`](assets/templates/validation-report.md.template) as the default shape. Always include command outcomes and clearly identify not-run gates.

## Output contract

Every final response for validation work must include applicable sections:

1. Mode and target path.
2. Scope and blocked paths protected.
3. Baseline evidence before fixes.
4. Commands executed with pass/fail/not-run status.
5. Failure classification and root cause hypothesis.
6. Files created or changed.
7. Validation after changes.
8. Remaining risks and limitations.
9. Next recommended action, if any.

## Stop conditions

Stop and report a blocker when:

- target root cannot be identified;
- the requested repair requires editing blocked paths without explicit authorization;
- command execution requires missing credentials, destructive operations, network access, or dependency installation not authorized by the user;
- validation cannot be reproduced and no failure evidence is supplied;
- the fix would require changing production behavior outside test/validator/build/lint plumbing;
- generated tests would require inventing domain facts not present in source, existing tests, docs, or user-provided evidence.
