description: Add or remove Swift files in the AIQ Xcode project. Use when creating new Swift files (views, view models, services, models, tests) that need to be added to the Xcode project and build targets, or when dead files need to be removed. Use when this capability is needed.

# Xcode File Manager Skill

This skill handles adding and removing Swift files in the AIQ Xcode project using the `xcodeproj` Ruby gem.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill whenever you:
- Create a new Swift file in the `ios/AIQ/` directory
- Create a new test file in the `ios/AIQTests/` directory
- Need to add existing Swift files to the Xcode project
- Need to remove dead or deleted Swift files from the Xcode project

## How to Add Files

### Using the Existing Script

There is a reusable Ruby script at `ios/scripts/add_files_to_xcode.rb`. Use it like this:

```bash
cd ios && ruby scripts/add_files_to_xcode.rb <relative_path_to_file>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Add a single file
cd ios && ruby scripts/add_files_to_xcode.rb AIQ/ViewModels/NewViewModel.swift

# Add multiple files
cd ios && ruby scripts/add_files_to_xcode.rb AIQ/Views/NewView.swift AIQ/ViewModels/NewViewModel.swift

# Add a test file (automatically added to AIQTests target)
cd ios && ruby scripts/add_files_to_xcode.rb AIQTests/NewTests.swift
```

### File Path Convention

- Paths must be relative to the `ios/` directory
- The script uses the directory structure to find the correct Xcode group
- Files in `AIQ/` are added to the main `AIQ` target
- Files in `AIQTests/` are added to the `AIQTests` target

### Common Directories

> **New feature modules** go under `AIQ/Features/<Module>/{Views,ViewModels}/` (e.g., `AIQ/Features/Dashboard/Views/`). Use `/xcode-group-manager` to create the group hierarchy first.

| Directory | Purpose | Target |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `AIQ/Features/<Module>/Views/` | SwiftUI views for a feature module | AIQ |
| `AIQ/Features/<Module>/ViewModels/` | View models for a feature module | AIQ |
| `AIQ/Views/` | Legacy/shared SwiftUI views (not under a feature module) | AIQ |
| `AIQ/ViewModels/` | Legacy/shared view models (not under a feature module) | AIQ |
| `AIQ/Models/` | Data models | AIQ |
| `AIQ/Services/` | API and business services | AIQ |
| `AIQ/Utilities/` | Helper utilities | AIQ |
| `AIQTests/` | Unit tests | AIQTests |

### Creating New Groups

If you need to add a file to a group that **does not yet exist** in the Xcode project, use the `/xcode-group-manager` skill first to create the group hierarchy, then run this skill to add the files.

```bash
# Step 1: Create the missing group
cd ios && ruby scripts/manage_xcode_groups.rb --create-group AIQ/Features/Auth/Views

# Step 2: Then add the file normally
cd ios && ruby scripts/add_files_to_xcode.rb AIQ/Features/Auth/Views/LoginView.swift
```

> **Why:** If the group is missing, `add_files_to_xcode.rb` silently places the file under the root AIQ group with an incorrect path, which causes "Build input files cannot be found" build failures. Always create the group first.

### Verifying path attributes after adding files

After running `add_files_to_xcode.rb` for files in nested groups (e.g., `AIQ/Features/Test/Views/`), verify the `PBXFileReference` in `project.pbxproj` uses the full relative path — not just the filename. The script sometimes registers `path = Filename.swift` instead of `path = Features/Module/Views/Filename.swift`, which causes "Build input file cannot be found" errors. Compare against sibling files in the same group to confirm the format includes `name = Filename.swift; path = Features/...`.

### Migrating existing files to a new location

When files are **already registered** in the Xcode project and you're moving them (e.g., from `AIQ/Views/X.swift` to `AIQ/Features/Y/Views/X.swift`), `add_files_to_xcode.rb` detects the existing file reference by filename and moves it into the new group — but does **not** update its `path` attribute. This results in the file resolving to the wrong filesystem location and a "Build input files cannot be found" failure.

After running the add + remove scripts for a migration, verify the updated file references use the full relative path pattern:

```
name = Filename.swift; path = Features/Module/Views/Filename.swift; sourceTree = "<group>";
```

Compare against a known-good reference (e.g., `WelcomeView.swift` under `Features/Auth/Views/`) to confirm the format. If `path` attributes are wrong or missing the subdirectory, update them manually in `ios/AIQ.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` before building.

## How to Remove Files

There is a reusable Ruby script at `ios/scripts/remove_files_from_xcode.rb`. Use it like this:

```bash
cd ios && ruby scripts/remove_files_from_xcode.rb <relative_path_to_file>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Remove a single file (deletes from project and disk)
cd ios && ruby scripts/remove_files_from_xcode.rb AIQ/ViewModels/OldViewModel.swift

# Remove multiple files
cd ios && ruby scripts/remove_files_from_xcode.rb AIQ/Views/OldView.swift AIQ/ViewModels/OldViewModel.swift

# Remove from project only, keep file on disk
cd ios && ruby scripts/remove_files_from_xcode.rb --keep-files AIQ/openapi.json
```

The script:
- Removes the file reference from `project.pbxproj`
- Removes all build phase entries (Sources, Resources, etc.) across every target
- Deletes the file from disk (unless `--keep-files` is passed)

> **Warning:** Disk deletion is permanent. Ensure the file is committed to git before running without `--keep-files`.

> **Note:** The remove script does **not** stage any changes in git. After running the script, you must stage changes manually before committing:
> - Without `--keep-files`: `git add <path/to/file> ios/AIQ.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
> - With `--keep-files`: `git add ios/AIQ.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

### Options

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| *(none)* | Remove from project and delete from disk |
| `--keep-files` | Remove from project only; file is not deleted |

## Prerequisites

The `xcodeproj` gem must be installed:

```bash
gem install xcodeproj
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"Group not found"**: The directory structure in the file path must match the group structure in the Xcode project
- **"File already in project"**: The file reference already exists; the script will skip it unless the path is incorrect
- **"File not found"**: The Swift file must exist on disk before running the add script
- **"File not found in project"**: The file reference doesn't exist in the project; nothing to remove
