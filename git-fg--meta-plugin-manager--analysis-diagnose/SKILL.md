## Quick Start

Bug encountered → Document symptom → Gather evidence → Form single hypothesis → Test with minimal reproduction → Identify root cause → Implement fix

## Semantic Anchors

### Single Hypothesis Protocol

Test one theory at a time for clear verification. Multiple simultaneous hypotheses create uncertainty about which fix worked.

**Process:**
1. Form hypothesis based on evidence (not assumptions)
2. Create minimal reproduction test
3. Confirm or reject
4. Only then move to next hypothesis

**Example:**
```
Hypothesis: "Request size exceeds limit"
Test: Send request with 151 items, expect 500 error
Result: Confirmed
Next: Implement maxItems validation
```

### 5 Whys Technique

Iterative questioning to reach actionable root cause. Each "why" drills deeper from symptom to cause.

**Process:**
```
Problem: [Observable symptom]

Why 1: [First-level cause]
→ Because [explanation]

Why 2: [Second-level cause]
→ Because [explanation]

Why 3: [Third-level cause]
→ Because [explanation]

Why 4: [Fourth-level cause]
→ Because [explanation]

Why 5: [Root cause]
→ Because [explanation]

Root Cause: [The fundamental issue]
Action: [What to fix to prevent recurrence]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Be specific — each answer factual and verifiable
- Avoid blame — focus on systems and processes
- Check logic — ensure each answer explains the previous level
- Stop at actionable — when you reach something you can fix

### Pattern Recognition

Distinguish isolated bugs from architectural problems.

**Isolated Issue:**
- Single component affected
- Reproducible with specific input
- No cascade effects
- Local fix sufficient

**Systemic Problem:**
- Multiple components affected
- Architecture-level issue
- State management problem
- Integration failure

**Decision rule:** 3+ similar failures = systemic problem requiring architectural review, not localized patches.

### Evidence-Based Investigation

Every claim requires verification:
- File reads for code analysis
- Diagnostic output for system state
- Git history for recent changes
- No assumptions about what's "obvious"

## Diagnostic Flow

### Phase 1: State the Problem

Document symptom before investigating:
- Exact error messages
- Stack traces
- Reproduction steps
- Frequency (Always/Sometimes/Once)

### Phase 2: Gather Evidence

Collect proof, don't assume:
- **Logs**: Error output, console logs
- **Recent changes**: `git log --oneline -10`
- **Environment**: OS, versions, dependencies
- **Diagnostics**: Test output, build status

**Temporal analysis:** When did this first occur? What changed between working and broken?

**Backward tracing:** Start from error, trace call stack to failure point, find root cause upstream.

### Phase 3: Form Hypothesis

Single hypothesis based on evidence.

**Good hypothesis:**
- Based on evidence from Phase 2
- Falsifiable (can be proven wrong)
- Specific (predicts exact behavior)
- Actionable (suggests concrete fix)

**Bad hypothesis:**
- Multiple competing theories
- Based on assumptions, not evidence
- Too vague to test

### Phase 4: Test & Conclude

Minimal reproduction test before full fix.

**Process:**
1. Create smallest test that confirms hypothesis
2. Verify expected vs actual result
3. If confirmed: implement fix
4. If rejected: return to Phase 3 with new hypothesis
5. After fix: verify no regressions

    <error_messages>[Complete error text]</error_messages>

  <hypothesis>
    <root_cause>[Likely root cause]</root_cause>
    <reasoning>[Why this causes symptom]</reasoning>
    <confidence>[High/Medium/Low]</confidence>
  </hypothesis>

  <test>
    <minimal_reproduction>[Smallest test]</minimal_reproduction>
    <expected_result>[What should happen]</expected_result>

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tests pass locally, fail in CI | Check environment differences, timeouts, race conditions |
| Flaky tests | Look for async timing issues, mock dependencies properly |
| Bug recurs after fix | Root cause wasn't truly fixed — re-run 5 Whys analysis |
| Multiple hypotheses conflicting | Test ONE at a time with minimal reproduction |
| Cannot determine isolated/systemic | Count affected components: 3+ = systemic |
| Investigation stalls after 3+ hypotheses | Question the pattern, not individual bugs |

## Pressure Resistance

Systematic investigation prevents shortcuts that create technical debt.

**Time pressure responses:**
- "Need to deploy soon" → Root cause prevents future issues
- "User waiting for fix" → Rushed fixes create more problems

**Sunk cost responses:**
- "Already spent 2 hours" → Wrong approach wastes more time
- "Almost there" → Return to root cause with fresh perspective

**Obvious fix responses:**
- "It's obviously just X" → Obvious ≠ Correct, verify with evidence

**Protocol:** Acknowledge pressure → Return to systematic approach → Brief justification → Continue investigation

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- Gather concrete evidence before forming conclusions
- Test one hypothesis at a time
- Use 5 Whys to reach root cause
- Document root cause for future reference
- Verify with minimal reproduction before full fix

**DON'T:**
- Apply fixes without root cause investigation
- Test multiple hypotheses simultaneously
- Assume obvious = correct
- Ignore patterns (3+ failures = systemic)
- Fall for sunk cost rationalization

## Validation Checklist

Before claiming diagnosis complete:

**Problem Statement:**
- [ ] Symptom documented with exact error messages
- [ ] Reproduction steps verified
- [ ] Frequency and conditions identified

**Evidence Gathering:**
- [ ] Logs and error output collected
- [ ] Recent changes reviewed (git history)
- [ ] Environment data documented

**Hypothesis Formation:**
- [ ] Single hypothesis based on evidence
- [ ] Hypothesis is falsifiable
- [ ] Confidence level assigned

**Test & Conclude:**
- [ ] Minimal reproduction test created
- [ ] Hypothesis confirmed or rejected
- [ ] Root cause identified with file:line evidence
- [ ] Fix strategy documented

**Pattern Recognition:**
- [ ] Isolated vs systemic determined
- [ ] 3+ failures = architectural flag raised

## Genetic Code

<critical_constraint>
**Portability Invariant: Zero External Dependencies**

This component must work in a project with ZERO external rules access (no CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md, or .claude/rules/ dependencies).
All necessary philosophy is embedded within this skill.

**Evidence Requirements**

Complete evidence gathering before proposing fixes.
Document symptoms, evidence, hypothesis before implementing.
Test hypothesis with minimal reproduction before full fix.

**Single Hypothesis Protocol**

Form single hypothesis based on evidence.
Test with minimal reproduction.
Confirm or reject before next hypothesis.

**Architecture Pattern Recognition**

Three or more similar failures indicate architectural problems requiring broader solutions than localized patches.

**Delta Standard**: Good Component = Expert Knowledge − What Claude Already Knows
