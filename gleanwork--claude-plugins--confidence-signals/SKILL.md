# Confidence Signals

When presenting information from Glean, communicate the reliability, freshness, and authority of your sources clearly.

## When This Applies

Use these patterns when:
- Presenting search results that may be outdated
- Information comes from sources with different authority levels
- Results are incomplete or may have gaps
- The user should verify before acting
- Multiple sources have conflicting information
- You're making inferences beyond what sources explicitly state

---

## Part 1: Vetting & Filtering (Before Presenting)

**Be skeptical.** Not everything Glean returns should be presented. Better to return 3 high-quality results than 10 unvetted mentions.

### Vetting Criteria

Before including ANY result, evaluate:

**1. Relevance Test**
- Does this actually answer the question, or just contain matching keywords?
- Is this about the same thing or just similar terminology?
- ❌ REJECT: Tangential mentions, keyword coincidences, unrelated contexts

**2. Authority Test**
- 📗 **Official**: RFCs, approved specs, policies, CODEOWNERS → Include
- 📙 **Semi-official**: Team wikis, project docs → Include with note
- 📕 **Informal**: Slack discussions, drafts, personal notes → Include only if no official sources exist
- ❌ REJECT: Clearly superseded or deprecated content

**3. Recency Test**
- ✅ **Current** (<3 months): Include with confidence
- ⚠️ **Aging** (3-12 months): Include with staleness warning
- ❌ **Stale** (12+ months): Only include if no alternatives, with strong warning
- Ask: "Would this still be true today?"

**4. Expertise Test (for people recommendations)**
- Did they actually do significant work, or just mentioned it once?
- Are they still in a relevant role?
- Do multiple signals confirm expertise?
- ❌ REJECT: Single mentions, departed employees, outdated ownership

### "Nothing Found" Is Valid

If vetting eliminates all candidates, say so clearly:

```markdown
No high-quality results found for [topic].

**This could mean:**
- The topic is new or undocumented
- Different terminology is used internally
- Access restrictions limit visibility
- This genuinely doesn't exist

**Suggested next steps:**
- Try alternative terms: [suggestions]
- Ask in [relevant Slack channel]
- Check with [likely team]
```

Never pad results with low-quality matches to avoid saying "nothing found."

## Part 2: Confidence Dimensions (When Presenting)

### 1. Freshness

How recently was this information updated?

| Freshness | Indicator | Implication |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Current | Updated within past week | High confidence |
| Recent | Updated within past month | Good confidence |
| Older | Updated 1-6 months ago | Verify if critical |
| Stale | Updated 6+ months ago | Likely outdated |
| Unknown | No update date available | Treat with caution |

**How to express:**
- "As of [date]..."
- "Last updated [timeframe]..."
- "Note: This doc hasn't been updated since [date]"
- Include "(updated [date])" in source citations

### 2. Source Authority

How authoritative is this source?

| Authority | Examples | Confidence |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Official | RFCs, approved specs, policies | High |
| Semi-official | Team wikis, shared docs | Medium-High |
| Discussion | Slack threads, meeting notes | Medium |
| Personal | Individual docs, drafts | Lower |
| AI-generated | Chat synthesis | Verify claims |

**How to express:**
- "According to the official [doc type]..."
- "From team documentation (may be informal)..."
- "Based on Slack discussion (not formally documented)..."
- "From meeting notes (verify if critical)..."

### 3. Completeness

How complete is this information?

| Completeness | Situation | Action |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Comprehensive | Multiple sources confirm | High confidence |
| Partial | Some aspects found, gaps exist | Note gaps |
| Limited | Few results, may miss context | Suggest verification |
| Inference | Synthesized from indirect sources | Clearly state |

**How to express:**
- "Based on comprehensive documentation..."
- "Found partial information - gaps in [area]"
- "Limited results found - suggest checking with [person/team]"
- "Inferred from related documents (not explicitly stated)..."

### 4. Corroboration

Do multiple sources agree?

| Corroboration | Situation | Confidence |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Strongly corroborated | 3+ sources agree | Very high |
| Corroborated | 2 sources agree | High |
| Single source | Only one source found | Medium |
| Conflicting | Sources disagree | Note conflict |

**How to express:**
- "Confirmed across multiple sources..."
- "Single source - recommend verification"
- "Note: Sources conflict on this point..."

## Signal Templates

### For Search Results

```markdown
**[Title]** ([link])
- Updated: [date] ([freshness assessment])
- Source: [authority level]
- Relevance: [why this matches]
```

### For Synthesized Answers

```markdown
## [Answer]

**Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]
- Based on [X] sources
- Most recent: [date]
- [Any caveats]

**Sources**:
- [Source 1] - [authority], updated [date]
- [Source 2] - [authority], updated [date]
```

### For Uncertain Information

```markdown
## [Topic]

**What I Found**: [Information]

**Caveats**:
- [ ] Source is [X] months old - verify currency
- [ ] Based on single source - seek corroboration
- [ ] Inferred, not explicitly stated
- [ ] Conflicts with [other source]

**Suggested Verification**: Contact [person] or check [source]
```

### For Conflicts

```markdown
## [Topic] - Conflicting Information

| Aspect | Source A | Source B | Assessment |
|--------|----------|----------|------------|
| [Item] | [Says X] | [Says Y] | [Which is likely correct] |

**Recommendation**: Verify with [authoritative source/person]
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Stale Documentation
```
Note: This documentation was last updated [X months ago].
The information may be outdated - verify with [team/person]
if making decisions based on this.
```

### Pattern: Informal Source
```
This comes from [Slack/meeting notes] rather than formal
documentation. Consider documenting this officially if it's
important knowledge to preserve.
```

### Pattern: AI-Synthesized
```
This answer was synthesized by Glean's AI across multiple
sources. For critical decisions, verify the underlying
documents directly: [links]
```

### Pattern: Incomplete Results
```
I found [X] relevant results, but there may be additional
information in [other sources/systems]. This represents
what's accessible through Glean with your current permissions.
```

### Pattern: Strong Confidence
```
This is well-documented with multiple corroborating sources:
- Official spec: [link]
- Recent meeting confirmation: [link]
- Implementation: [link]

High confidence in this answer.
```

## When to Emphasize Confidence

Always note confidence when:
- User will make a decision based on the information
- Information is time-sensitive
- Sources are from informal channels
- Only one source was found
- The topic involves policy, security, or compliance
- You're synthesizing rather than directly quoting

## Relationship to Other Skills

This skill works with:
- `synthesis-patterns` - When combining multiple sources
- `glean-tools-guide` - For understanding source types
- `enterprise-search` - When presenting search results
