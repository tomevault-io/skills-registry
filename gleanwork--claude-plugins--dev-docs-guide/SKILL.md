# Glean Developer Documentation Guide

When users ask about developing with Glean, use the Glean Developer Docs MCP tools.

## Tool Naming

Tools follow the pattern: `mcp__glean_dev_docs__[tool]`
- `docs_search` - Search across documentation
- `docs_fetch` - Get full page content

If tools unavailable, suggest running `/glean-dev-docs:setup`.

## When to Use

- **Glean API** - endpoints, authentication, rate limits
- **SDK usage** - Python, JavaScript installation and examples
- **MCP integration** - server configuration, tool capabilities
- **Platform concepts** - indexing, search configuration, connectors

## Tool Selection

| Need | Tool | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Find relevant docs | `docs_search` | `docs_search "API authentication"` |
| Get implementation details | `docs_fetch` | `docs_fetch "https://developers.glean.com/docs/api/auth"` |

## Workflow

1. **Search first**: `docs_search "user query terms"`
2. **Review results**: Identify most relevant pages
3. **Fetch for details**: `docs_fetch "[url]"` for code examples
4. **Cite sources**: Always include documentation URLs

## Query Tips

Good: `"OAuth token refresh"`, `"Python SDK search API"`
Less effective: `"authentication"`, `"API"`, `"how to use"`

## Differentiating from Enterprise Glean

This skill is for **public developer documentation**:
- How to build with Glean APIs/SDKs
- MCP configuration guides

For **internal company data** (Slack, email, internal docs), guide to glean-core plugins instead.
