Triggers on complex queries that span multiple data types, when results seem contradictory, when building comprehensive answers from partial information, or when the user asks for a complete picture of something that requires multiple queries.

# Multi-Source Synthesis Patterns

When answering questions that require information from multiple Glean sources, use these patterns to combine and synthesize effectively.

## When This Applies

Use this approach when:
- A question spans documents, meetings, people, and code
- You need to cross-reference information from different sources
- Results from one source need context from another
- Building a comprehensive answer from partial information
- Sources seem to conflict or overlap

## BE SKEPTICAL

When synthesizing across multiple sources, aggressive vetting is essential:

**Source Quality Test**
- Is each source authoritative?
- ✅ INCLUDE: Official docs, code, recent meetings
- ⚠️ CONTEXT: Secondary sources, somewhat dated
- ❌ EXCLUDE: Hearsay, speculation, very old information

**Recency vs Authority**
- When sources disagree on recency, choose wisely:
- ✅ TRUST: Recent information from official source
- ⚠️ CAUTION: Very recent but unofficial vs stale but official
- ❌ AVOID: Treating old info as current just because it's "official"

**Completeness Check**
- Do you have the full picture?
- ✅ INCLUDE: 3+ sources align, comprehensive coverage
- ⚠️ CONTEXT: Limited sources, note gaps explicitly
- ❌ EXCLUDE: Single source for multi-faceted questions

**Conflict Resolution**
- When sources conflict, don't hide it:
- ✅ INCLUDE: Conflict + explanation of which is likely correct
- ❌ EXCLUDE: Picking one source without acknowledging disagreement

**Filter Out**:
- Unattributed claims
- Information older than 3 months (unless structure/architecture)
- Synthesis that glosses over fundamental disagreements
- "I synthesized this" without showing your work

**Say "I don't know"** when:
- Sources are missing or conflicting
- Information is too stale to be reliable
- You lack sufficient data to synthesize confidently

## The Synthesis Framework

### 1. Identify Information Types Needed

Before querying, determine what types of information are needed:

| Information Type | Glean Tool | Use When |
|------------------|------------|----------|
| Official documentation | `search` | Need authoritative specs, policies |
| Real-time context | `meeting_lookup` | Need recent discussions, decisions |
| People/org structure | `employee_search` | Need ownership, expertise |
| Code evidence | `code_search` | Need implementation truth |
| User's own context | `memory`, `user_activity` | Need personalization |
| AI synthesis | `chat` | Need reasoning across sources |

### 2. Query in Optimal Order

**Recommended order for comprehensive synthesis:**

1. **Start broad with `chat`** - Get AI-synthesized overview
2. **Verify with `search`** - Find authoritative documents
3. **Add recency with `meeting_lookup`** - Get latest discussions
4. **Clarify ownership with `employee_search`** - Identify who to ask
5. **Ground in reality with `code_search`** - What's actually implemented

### 3. Cross-Reference Pattern

When you have results from multiple sources, cross-reference:

```markdown
## Finding: [Topic]

### From Documentation
- [What docs say] - Source: [doc title] ([link])

### From Recent Meetings
- [What was discussed] - Source: [meeting date]

### From Code
- [What's implemented] - Source: [file/repo]

### Synthesis
Based on these sources: [Your synthesized answer]

### Confidence
- Documentation: [Current/Stale/Missing]
- Meeting Context: [Recent/Old/None]
- Code Evidence: [Present/Partial/None]
```

### 4. Handle Conflicts

When sources disagree:

```markdown
## Conflicting Information Detected

| Topic | Source A Says | Source B Says |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| [Topic] | [Claim from doc] | [Claim from meeting] |

**Most Likely Truth**: [Your assessment based on recency, authority]

**Recommendation**: Verify with [person/source]
```

## Synthesis Patterns by Use Case

### Pattern: "What is X?"

1. `chat` - Get overview
2. `search` - Find official definition
3. `employee_search` - Find owner to verify
4. Synthesize: Combine AI overview + official doc + owner context

### Pattern: "Who should I talk to about X?"

1. `employee_search` - Find by role
2. `code_search` - Find by code activity
3. `search` - Find by doc authorship
4. Synthesize: Rank by multiple signal strength

### Pattern: "What's the status of X?"

1. `chat` - Get current status summary
2. `meeting_lookup` - Find recent discussions
3. `search` - Find tracking docs (Jira, etc.)
4. Synthesize: Combine with recency weighting

### Pattern: "How do we do X?"

1. `search` - Find process docs
2. `code_search` - Find implementation
3. `meeting_lookup` - Find recent changes
4. Synthesize: Doc process + code reality + recent updates

## Output Best Practices

1. **Cite every source** - Include links for all claims
2. **Note recency** - When was this information last updated?
3. **Flag uncertainty** - Be clear about gaps
4. **Suggest verification** - Point to people who can confirm
5. **Acknowledge conflicts** - Don't hide disagreements

## Example Synthesis Output

```markdown
## [Question/Topic]

### Answer
[Direct answer to the question]

### Supporting Evidence

| Source | What It Says | Last Updated |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| [Doc Title] | [Key info] | [Date] |
| [Meeting] | [Key info] | [Date] |
| [Code/Repo] | [Key info] | [Date] |

### Confidence Assessment
- **Overall Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Data Freshness**: [Current/Mostly current/Some stale]
- **Source Agreement**: [Strong/Partial/Conflicting]

### Gaps & Recommendations
- [What's missing or uncertain]
- [Who to verify with if critical]
```
