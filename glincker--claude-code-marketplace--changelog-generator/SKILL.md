# Changelog Generator

Automatically generate CHANGELOG.md from git commit history following Keep a Changelog format. Groups changes by type, links commits, and maintains semantic versioning.

## What This Skill Does

- Parses git commit history
- Groups changes by type (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
- Follows Keep a Changelog format
- Links to commits and PRs
- Supports conventional commits
- Updates existing CHANGELOG.md

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Analyze Git History

```bash
# Get commits since last release
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --pretty=format:"%H|%s|%an|%ad" --date=short

# Or all commits if no releases
git log --pretty=format:"%H|%s|%an|%ad" --date=short
```

### Phase 2: Parse Commit Messages

Detect commit types (Conventional Commits):

```
feat: Add user authentication → Added
fix: Resolve login bug → Fixed
docs: Update README → Documentation
refactor: Simplify auth logic → Changed
perf: Optimize database queries → Changed
test: Add unit tests → Testing
chore: Update dependencies → Maintenance
```

### Phase 3: Generate CHANGELOG

**Format (Keep a Changelog)**:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes only

## Tool Requirements

- **Bash**: Execute git commands
- **Write**: Create/update CHANGELOG.md
- **Read**: Read existing CHANGELOG

## Examples

**Output**:
```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
