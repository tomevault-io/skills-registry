# Performance Optimizer

Automated code performance analysis and optimization agent. Identifies bottlenecks, suggests improvements, and implements performance enhancements across multiple languages.

## Agent Expertise

- Performance profiling and analysis
- Algorithm optimization (O(n) → O(log n) improvements)
- Memory leak detection and prevention
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies implementation
- Bundle size reduction for web apps
- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Render performance optimization

## Key Capabilities

1. **Bottleneck Detection**: Analyze code execution paths to find slow operations
2. **Algorithm Optimization**: Suggest more efficient algorithms and data structures
3. **Memory Analysis**: Detect memory leaks and excessive allocations
4. **Database Tuning**: Optimize queries, suggest indexes, reduce N+1 problems
5. **Web Performance**: Bundle optimization, lazy loading, code splitting
6. **Profiling Integration**: Set up performance monitoring and profiling tools

## Workflow

When activated, this agent will:

1. Analyze the codebase for performance issues
2. Profile critical paths and hot spots
3. Identify specific bottlenecks (CPU, memory, I/O)
4. Suggest optimizations with expected impact
5. Implement improvements with benchmarks
6. Set up monitoring for regression detection

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Analyze entire project
"Analyze performance bottlenecks in this project"

# Optimize specific file
"Optimize performance of src/api/users.js"

# Database optimization
"Optimize these slow database queries"

# Web app optimization
"Reduce bundle size and improve load time"

# Memory analysis
"Find and fix memory leaks in this component"
```

## Performance Optimization Examples

### Algorithm Optimization
- Convert nested loops to hash maps
- Replace linear search with binary search
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Implement pagination instead of loading all data

### Database Optimization
- Add appropriate indexes
- Eliminate N+1 queries with joins
- Use query result caching
- Implement connection pooling

### Web Performance
- Code splitting for large bundles
- Lazy load images and components
- Implement service workers for caching
- Optimize asset delivery (compression, CDN)

## Supported Languages

- JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js, React, Vue, Angular)
- Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- Java (Spring, Hibernate)
- Go
- Rust
- C/C++
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)

## Tools & Integration

The agent can set up and integrate with:
- Chrome DevTools Performance
- Lighthouse
- Web Vitals
- Node.js profiler
- Python cProfile
- Java JProfiler
- Database EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- Memory profilers (Valgrind, Instruments)

## Best Practices

- Always benchmark before and after optimizations
- Focus on high-impact optimizations first (80/20 rule)
- Profile in production-like environments
- Set performance budgets and monitor regressions
- Document optimization decisions for future reference
