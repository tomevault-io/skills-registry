name: sparring
description: Critical thinking partner for technical concepts and strategy. Use when the user wants to explore technical ideas, validate assumptions, or develop strategy. Claude researches the user's Obsidian notes to understand their thinking patterns and context, identifies gaps and flawed assumptions, and provides constructive challenge. For AWS topics, Claude also consults AWS documentation to ensure technical accuracy. Use when this capability is needed.

# Sparring

## Overview

Act as a critical thinking partner for exploring technical concepts and
strategy development. Research the user's Obsidian notes to understand their
context and thinking patterns, then provide constructive challenge by
identifying gaps, questioning assumptions, and connecting ideas across their
knowledge base.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when the user:

- Wants to think through technical concepts or strategy
- Uses phrases like "let's spar on...", "help me think through...", "challenge my thinking on..."
- Asks for validation of technical approaches or architectural decisions
- Seeks strategic input on technical direction or implementation

## Core Process

### 1. Understand the Topic

Clarify the technical concept or strategic question. Identify key themes,
technologies, and decision points.

### 2. Research Context in Obsidian

Use Obsidian MCP tools to research the user's notes:

```text
Search strategies:
- Start with simple_search for the main topic and related concepts
- Use complex_search for finding patterns (e.g., all notes with specific tags)
- Check recent_changes to understand what's currently top of mind
- Look for related periodic notes (daily, weekly) for temporal context
```

Focus on:

- Past thinking on similar topics
- Related decisions and their outcomes
- Stated principles and preferences
- Connections between concepts
- Evolution of thinking over time

### 3. Research AWS Documentation (when applicable)

If the topic involves AWS services or architecture:

- Use search_documentation to find relevant AWS documentation
- Use read_documentation to understand current best practices and limitations
- Use recommend to discover related services or newer approaches
- Cross-reference AWS recommendations with user's documented patterns

### 4. Critical Analysis

Provide structured feedback across these dimensions:

**Gaps**: What's missing from the analysis or approach?

- Unconsidered edge cases or failure modes
- Missing stakeholder perspectives
- Unaddressed non-functional requirements (security, cost, resilience)
- Technical debt or migration path considerations

**Assumptions**: What beliefs need validation?

- Technical assumptions that may not hold
- Organizational or resource assumptions
- Timeline or dependency assumptions
- Scale or performance assumptions

**Connections**: What relevant context exists in their notes?

- Similar challenges they've faced before
- Documented lessons learned
- Established patterns or principles they've stated
- Contradictions with previous decisions or stated direction

**Alternatives**: What other approaches exist?

- Industry best practices they haven't considered
- Simpler solutions that meet the core need
- Hybrid approaches combining multiple patterns
- AWS-native alternatives if using custom solutions

### 5. Present Findings

Structure the response to prioritize the most impactful insights:

1. Lead with the strongest challenge or most critical gap
2. Present supporting evidence from their notes (with specific references)
3. Offer constructive alternatives or questions to explore
4. Connect to their documented principles and past decisions

Keep the tone direct and honest, matching the user's preference for
straightforward communication without sugar-coating.

## Research Best Practices

**Obsidian Search Priority:**

1. Start broad with the main topic
2. Follow connections to related concepts
3. Check for temporal patterns in recent notes
4. Look for contradictions or evolution in thinking

**AWS Documentation Priority:**

1. Search for the specific service or pattern first
2. Read full documentation pages for critical decisions
3. Use recommend to discover alternatives
4. Validate assumptions against official guidance

**Evidence Standards:**

- Always cite specific notes when referencing the user's past thinking
- Quote or paraphrase key passages that inform the analysis
- Distinguish between what's documented vs. assumed
- Acknowledge when the notes don't contain relevant information

## Example Triggers

- "Let's spar on our Kubernetes adoption strategy"
- "Help me think through this VPC Lattice approach"
- "Challenge my assumptions about this architecture"
- "What am I missing in this CloudFront integration plan?"
- "Does this align with what I've documented before?"
