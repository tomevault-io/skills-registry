# Human Communications Skill

> Master protocol for all outbound human communication. Drafts messages for Aiden's review, routes to correct channel, manages approval.

## Trigger

- Any need to communicate externally
- Task requires contacting someone
- Follow-up reminder triggered
- Manual: "reach out to [person]" or "contact [person] about [topic]"

---

## Default Behaviour: Draft and Show

**All communications are drafted first, then shown to Aiden for approval.** Never send without explicit sign-off.

### Draft Review Format

```
Draft for [RECIPIENT] via [CHANNEL]:

---
[DRAFT_CONTENT]
---

Context: [WHY_THIS_MESSAGE]

Commands:
- "send" - send as-is
- "edit: [your changes]" - modify
- "skip" - cancel
```

## When to Draft vs When to Ask First

### Quick Reference

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Reply to friend's text | Draft |
| Cold outreach to prospect | Ask first |
| Thank you note | Draft |
| Negotiating terms | Ask first |
| Scheduling meeting | Draft |
| Delivering bad news | Ask first |
| Routine follow-up | Draft |
| First contact with VIP | Ask first |
| Confirming details | Draft |
| Anything uncertain | Ask first |

### Decision Tree

```
COMMUNICATION NEED identified

-> Is this a REPLY to existing thread?
   -> YES: Draft response (context exists)

-> Is recipient in known contacts?
   -> YES: Draft allowed

-> Is this ROUTINE communication?
   (scheduling, confirming, thanking)
   -> YES: Draft allowed

-> Does this involve:
   - Commitment or promise?
   - Sensitive topic?
   - New relationship/first contact?
   - Negotiation?
   -> YES: ASK before drafting

-> Uncertain?
   -> ASK: "I think I should [action]. Should I draft something?"
```

    context: work, BNS inventory

```

## Brand Voice Integration

All drafted communications MUST pass through the brand-voice skill:

```yaml
brand_voice:
  skill_path: ".claude/skills/brand-voice"
  always_validate: true

validation_checklist:
  - Sounds like Aiden (not robotic)
  - Correct formality level for recipient
  - No em-dashes
  - No AI cliches
  - No banned phrases
  - Short enough (can anything be cut?)
```

---

## Autonomy Boundaries

```yaml
autonomous:
  - Draft for review
  - Suggest channels
  - Apply brand voice
  - Prepare follow-up reminders

needs_approval:
  - Send any communication
  - Contact new person

never_without_asking:
  - Send to group/list
  - Make commitments
  - Communicate sensitive topics
  - Anything involving BNS (flag for manual)
```

---
