# Gmacko Release Closure

Finalize release by closing issues, creating GitHub release, and archiving documentation.

## When to Use

- Deployment is complete and verified
- Ready to close related issues
- Need to create GitHub release
- Archiving release documentation

## Prerequisites

- Deployment verified (web and/or mobile)
- Release summary exists
- `gh` CLI authenticated

## Workflow

```dot
digraph release_close {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];
    
    start [label="Start Closure" shape=ellipse];
    verify [label="1. Verify Deployment"];
    issues [label="2. Close Issues"];
    prs [label="3. Annotate PRs"];
    tag [label="4. Create Git Tag"];
    release [label="5. Create GitHub Release"];
    cleanup [label="6. Cleanup Branches"];
    notify [label="7. Notify Stakeholders"];
    archive [label="8. Archive Documentation"];
    done [label="Release Closed" shape=ellipse];
    
    start -> verify -> issues -> prs -> tag;
    tag -> release -> cleanup -> notify -> archive -> done;
}
```

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Verify Deployment

Confirm all deployments are successful:

```markdown
## Deployment Verification

### Web (Vercel)
- [ ] Production URL accessible: https://app.example.com
- [ ] Smoke tests passed
- [ ] No error spikes in Sentry

### Mobile (if applicable)
- [ ] iOS build submitted/approved
- [ ] Android build submitted/approved
- [ ] OTA update published (if applicable)
```

Ask user:
> Before closing the release, please confirm:
>
> 1. Web production is stable? (yes/no)
> 2. Mobile apps are approved/live? (yes/no/not-applicable)
> 3. Any issues reported since deployment? (yes/no)

### Step 2: Close Issues

Find and close related issues:

```bash
# List issues that should be closed
gh issue list --state open --label "status:in-progress"

# Get issues linked to merged PRs
gh pr list --state merged --json number,title,closingIssuesReferences
```

Close each issue with comment:

```bash
# Close issue with release reference
gh issue close [number] --comment "Released in v[X.Y.Z]. 

Deployment verified on [date].
- Web: https://app.example.com
- Mobile: v[X.Y.Z] on App Store/Play Store"
```

Track closures:
```markdown
## Issues Closed

| Issue | Title | Closed |
|-------|-------|--------|
| #100 | [Title] | Yes |
| #101 | [Title] | Yes |
| #102 | [Title] | Deferred (partial) |
```

### Step 3: Annotate PRs

Add release info to merged PRs:

```bash
# Add comment to PR
gh pr comment [number] --body "Released in v[X.Y.Z] :rocket:

Production: https://app.example.com
Release Notes: https://github.com/gmacko/project/releases/tag/v[X.Y.Z]"
```

### Step 4: Create Git Tag

Create annotated tag for release:

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a "v[X.Y.Z]" -m "Release v[X.Y.Z]

Features:
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]

Fixes:
- [Fix 1]
- [Fix 2]

See full changelog: docs/ai/releases/[date]-v[version].md"

# Push tag to remote
git push origin "v[X.Y.Z]"
```

### Step 5: Create GitHub Release

Create release with notes:

```bash
# Create release from tag
gh release create "v[X.Y.Z]" \
  --title "v[X.Y.Z]" \
  --notes-file /tmp/release-notes.md

# Or with inline notes
gh release create "v[X.Y.Z]" \
  --title "Release v[X.Y.Z]" \
  --notes "## What's New

### Features
- **[Feature]**: Description (#123)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed [issue] (#124)

### Full Changelog
https://github.com/gmacko/project/compare/v[prev]...v[X.Y.Z]"
```

For mobile releases, attach build artifacts (optional):
```bash
# Upload build artifacts
gh release upload "v[X.Y.Z]" ./app-release.apk
```

### Step 6: Cleanup Branches

Clean up merged branches:

```bash
# List merged branches
git branch --merged main | grep -v "main\|staging\|dev"

# Delete local merged branches
git branch --merged main | grep -v "main\|staging\|dev" | xargs git branch -d

# Delete remote merged branches (with confirmation)
# gh api repos/gmacko/project/branches --jq '.[].name' | ...
```

Ask user before deleting:
> The following branches are merged and can be deleted:
> - feature/dark-mode
> - fix/login-bug
>
> Delete these branches? (yes/no/selective)

### Step 7: Notify Stakeholders

Prepare notification:

```markdown
## Release Notification

**Body**:

## Red Flags

| Rationalization | Correction |
|-----------------|------------|
| "Close issues without verifying deployment" | ALWAYS verify before closing |
| "Skip GitHub release, tag is enough" | GitHub release enables release notes discovery |
| "Don't need to notify anyone" | Stakeholders should know about releases |
| "Documentation can be updated later" | Finalize docs while context is fresh |
| "Delete branches without checking" | Confirm before deleting any branch |

## Integration

- **Input**: Version, deployment verification status
- **References**: Release summary, merged PRs, closed issues
- **Output**: GitHub release, closed issues, final documentation
- **Next**: Monitor post-release, start next sprint
