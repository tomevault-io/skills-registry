# flow-next-drive — surface-aware UI automation

Drive any UI surface the way a real user would. Whatever driver the environment has, the work is the same shape: **observe / navigate → snapshot → act on fresh refs → capture evidence → release**. This skill is a *router*: it detects the surface, picks the highest available driver on a ladder, degrades gracefully when a richer driver is absent, and hands off to a per-rung reference for the command detail.

It orchestrates drivers — it does not reimplement them. The default rung (Vercel's `agent-browser` CLI) is the only driver assumed present; every other rung is detected and optional. A pass must succeed with whatever the environment actually has — most cloud VMs, Linux, and CI have no Computer Use, so it is never a hard dependency and never on a headless/no-display path.

> Driver ladder + universal-flow structure adapted from Ray Fernando's `running-bug-review-board` skill (Apache-2.0) — see CHANGELOG.

## Step 1 — Detect the surface, then branch

Classify the target into one of three buckets and take the matching path. The universal flow (Step 2) is shared; only the actuation and the per-surface reference differ.

| # | Surface | What it is | Path |
|---|---------|------------|------|
| A | **Web app** | A URL in a browser (localhost dev server, staging, production) | **Web ladder** (Step 3) |
| B | **Chromium-backed desktop app** | Electron / Windows WebView2 — Chromium under the hood, exposes a CDP debug port | **Web ladder** (Step 3), attaching over CDP to the app's remote-debugging port |
| C | **True-native / non-CDP surface** | macOS AppKit/SwiftUI, Catalyst, or a webview exposing no CDP (macOS WKWebView, which Tauri uses on macOS) | **Native rung** (Step 4) — **Cua Driver** → **Computer Use** (attended); **Cua Sandbox** (headless/CI) |

How to decide:

- A bare URL, or a dev/staging/prod web app → **A**.
- A desktop app you can launch with `--remote-debugging-port=<n>` (or one already exposing one) → **B**. Electron and Windows WebView2 are Chromium; the web ladder drives them by CDP-attach. Do **not** route these to Computer Use.
- A desktop app with no CDP port — genuinely native (AppKit/SwiftUI), or a macOS WKWebView / Tauri-on-macOS app — → **C**. Per-platform caveat: **Windows WebView2 is CDP-drivable (→ B); macOS WKWebView generally is not (→ C)** — verify per platform.

When unsure whether a desktop app exposes CDP, probe for B first (try to launch/attach with a debug port). If no port is reachable, fall to C.

## Step 2 — The universal flow (all surfaces)

```
observe / list what's open
navigate to the target (URL, or focus the app window)
snapshot              → fresh element refs (REQUIRED before each act)
act                   → click / fill / type / press / scroll toward the next step
verify                → confirm the expected text / state appeared
capture               → screenshot + console/errors at the moment of interest (and on failure)
release               → close the tab / end the session when fully done
```

Refs (`@e1`, `@e2`, …) go **stale** after any navigation, click, or form submit. Always re-snapshot. "Element X has pointer-events: none" or "ref not found" almost always means a stale snapshot, not a real bug — re-snapshot before concluding.

## Step 3 — Web ladder (surfaces A and B)

Probe availability top-down and use the **highest rung that passes**; fail soft to the next; the terminal rung is manual. Never hard-depend on any rung above the default.

| Rung | Driver | Use when | Reference |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| 1 (default) | **agent-browser** CLI | Always assumed present. CDP-based, headless-safe, no extra install. Drives web apps; drives Electron / WebView2 over CDP (`--cdp <port>` / `--auto-connect`). | `references/agent-browser.md` |
| 2 | **chrome-devtools-mcp** | You want built-in auto-wait (fewer stale-ref failures), DevTools-grade network/console inspection, Lighthouse, or to **attach to your real signed-in Chrome** (`--browser-url` / `--autoConnect`) so bot defenses don't challenge an automated profile. | `references/chrome-devtools-mcp.md` |
| 3 | **Playwright** (CLI or MCP) | The repo already has Playwright configured, or you need a headless CI-style run / large cross-browser regression suite. | `references/playwright.md` |
| 4 | **cursor-ide-browser** MCP | Running inside Cursor with this MCP installed and you want its snapshot YAML + `browser_cdp` control. | `references/cursor-ide-browser.md` |
| 5 (terminal) | **Manual + screenshot relay** | No browser driver available — drive yourself, paste console errors and screenshots into chat. | — |

**Surface B note:** the SAME ladder drives Electron / WebView2 apps — attach to the app's remote-debugging port (`agent-browser --cdp <port>` / `--auto-connect`; chrome-devtools-mcp `--browser-url=http://127.0.0.1:<port>`). Launch the app with a dedicated debug port and a dedicated user-data-dir; treat the open debug port as a security exposure (any local app can drive that session).

> **agent-browser command detail lives in the rung reference, not here.** The default-rung reference [`references/agent-browser.md`](references/agent-browser.md) is the entry point — setup/version check, the universal flow in agent-browser commands, the Chromium-desktop (Electron / WebView2) CDP driver, the `--headed` daemon-reuse gotcha, and an index into the per-topic references it folds: `commands.md`, `advanced.md` (CDP attach), `auth.md`, `snapshot-refs.md`, `session-management.md`, `proxy.md`, `debugging.md`.

## Step 4 — Native rung (surface C): Cua Driver, then Computer Use

A genuinely native app (or a non-CDP webview) has no browser tab to attach to — the model has to drive the live machine. This rung is provider-agnostic; probe for the best available driver in this order, prefer the highest that passes, degrade to the next:

| Probe | Driver | Reference |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `cua-driver` MCP registered / `command -v cua-driver` (real display) | **Cua Driver** — MIT, provider-agnostic, **background** (no focus steal), macOS/Windows (Linux pre-release), accessibility-tree-based. Preferred when present. | `references/cua.md` |
| Codex CU available, or a Claude Computer-Use harness present | **Computer Use** — Codex CU (macOS/Windows) / Anthropic Claude CU (the API `computer` tool via its own harness). Screen-takeover. | `references/computer-use.md` |
| **Headless / CI** (no display) and a sandbox backend (`lume`/Docker/QEMU, or opted-in cloud) | **Cua Sandbox** — drive inside an isolated VM/container; the **only** native option with no real screen. Opt-in per run, torn down each run; local backend default, cua.ai cloud explicit opt-in. | `references/cua.md` |
| None present | **Documented limitation** — document the gap and stop; never fail silently. | — |

All share the universal flow (Step 2) — `observe → act → verify → capture`, described as goal + success state, not pixel coordinates; only the actuation differs. **Detect, never assume** (`command -v`, MCP list, `uname -s`); no native driver is ever a hard dependency. **Attended vs headless splits the precedence:** on a real display, prefer the background Cua Driver → Computer Use; on a **headless/CI** host (no screen) the **Cua Sandbox** is the only native option — the explicit ordering, the local-default/cloud-opt-in split, and provisioning/teardown live in `references/cua.md`.

→ Read `references/cua.md` for Cua Driver detection, the install/permission walkthrough (multi-host MCP wiring), the AX-tree driving loop, the macOS permission-split evidence mode, the Native-rung precedence list, licensing, and degradation.
→ Read `references/computer-use.md` for Computer Use availability detection, the enable/permission walkthrough, the driving loop, safety/hygiene, and the full graceful-degradation table.

## Driver detection & graceful degradation (all surfaces)

1. **Probe, don't assume.** Detect each non-default rung before planning around it (`command -v`, MCP list, `uname -s` for the macOS-only paths). Treat anything above the default rung — incl. **Cua Driver** and **Computer Use** — as *probably absent*.
2. **Pick the highest rung that passes; fail soft to the next.** The terminal rung is always manual / documented-limitation — the pass still completes.
3. **No native driver is required or on a headless/CI path.** Neither the local Cua Driver nor Computer Use runs without a real display; most VMs/Linux/CI lack both. (Headless/CI native driving is the opt-in **Cua Sandbox** surface — see `references/cua.md`.)
4. **Graceful degradation on the native rung (C):** *(Determine attended vs headless first — `$CI` ⇒ headless, else the empirical `cua-driver call get_screen_size` display probe; NOT `$DISPLAY` on macOS. See `references/cua.md` § "Determining headless / CI".)*
   - **Attended (real display):** prefer **Cua Driver** (background, provider-agnostic) when present → else **Computer Use** (screen-takeover) → else **documented-limitation** (document, don't fail).
   - **Headless / CI (no display):** the **Cua Sandbox** is the only native option (provision a hermetic VM, drive, tear down each run); local backend is the default, cua.ai cloud is explicit opt-in (bills + egress). No backend and no opted-in cloud → documented-limitation. See `references/cua.md`.
   - A **Chromium-backed app (B)** still drives via the web-ladder CDP attach (Step 3), or by driving its local dev-server URL in a browser. Note that shell-level integration (system tray, native menus, OS dialogs) can't be reached this way — surface that limitation.
   - A **genuinely native app (C)** with no native driver at all → document the limitation rather than fail.
   - On macOS, the Cua Driver's **Accessibility-vs-Screen-Recording permission split** means driving can work while screenshots don't — surface "AX-only evidence, no screenshot" rather than emit an empty one (`references/cua.md`).
5. **agent-browser stays the only assumed-present driver.** No MCP server, Cua Driver, or Computer Use is ever a hard install dependency; flowctl never imports any of them.

## Boundaries

- **iOS / iPadOS app driving is out of scope** — defer to the community iOS simulator skills. Never spin up an iOS simulator for a web-only app.
- This skill provides driver/actuation + the surface conditional. The full native-desktop QA *workflow* (scenario authoring, bug filing, verdict) is a downstream `/flow-next:qa` concern.
- Don't reinvent what a driver already does (Playwright, Computer Use) — orchestrate, don't replace.
