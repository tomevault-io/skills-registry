# Upsun CLI Management Skill

Comprehensive skill for managing Upsun Platform-as-a-Service projects using the Upsun CLI (v5.6.0+).

## Overview

This skill enables AI coding agents to help you manage Upsun projects through the Upsun CLI. Upsun is a unified, multi-cloud Platform-as-a-Service built for teams that need flexibility without compromise. This skill covers:

- **130+ CLI commands** across 30 namespaces
- **Deployment workflows** for safe production deployments
- **Environment management** including branching, merging, and synchronization
- **Backup and restore** operations with safety checks
- **Resource scaling** and autoscaling configuration
- **Database operations** for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Valkey
- **Security and access** management for teams and users
- **Development tools** including SSH, tunnels, and logs

## Prerequisites

**Authentication Required**: You must be authenticated to Upsun before using any commands.

Check authentication status:
```bash
upsun auth:info
```

If not authenticated, log in via browser:
```bash
upsun auth:browser-login
```

Or using an API token:
```bash
upsun auth:api-token-login
```

All helper scripts in this skill include automatic authentication checking.

## Quick Start

### Most Common Operations

**List your projects:**
```bash
upsun projects
```

**List environments in a project:**
```bash
upsun environments -p PROJECT_ID
```

**Deploy changes to an environment:**
```bash
upsun push -p PROJECT_ID -e ENVIRONMENT_NAME
```

**Create a backup before major changes:**
```bash
upsun backup:create -p PROJECT_ID -e ENVIRONMENT_NAME
```

**View environment logs:**
```bash
upsun logs -p PROJECT_ID -e ENVIRONMENT_NAME
```

## What Do You Want to Do?

## Helper Scripts

This skill includes helper scripts for complex operations. All scripts include authentication checking and error handling.

### Authentication & Health

**`scripts/check-auth.sh`** - Verify authentication status and guide user through login if needed

**`scripts/health-check.sh PROJECT_ID ENVIRONMENT_NAME`** - Comprehensive environment health check including deployment status, activities, metrics, and routes

### Deployment Safety

**`scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh PROJECT_ID ENVIRONMENT_NAME`** - Pre-deployment validation to catch common issues before deploying

### Backup Operations

**`scripts/backup-with-verification.sh PROJECT_ID ENVIRONMENT_NAME [--live]`** - Create backup and verify success, returns backup ID

**`scripts/safe-restore.sh PROJECT_ID ENVIRONMENT_NAME BACKUP_ID [--target ENV]`** - Safe restore with pre-restore backup and validation

### Status & Monitoring

**`scripts/environment-status.sh PROJECT_ID ENVIRONMENT_NAME`** - Detailed environment status in JSON format

**`scripts/resource-audit.sh PROJECT_ID`** - Resource usage analysis across all environments

## Common Workflows

### Safe Production Deployment

1. Verify authentication: `scripts/check-auth.sh`
2. Pre-deployment checks: `scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh PROJECT_ID production`
3. Create backup: `scripts/backup-with-verification.sh PROJECT_ID production`
4. Deploy: `upsun environment:deploy -p PROJECT_ID -e production`
5. Monitor: `upsun activity:log ACTIVITY_ID`
6. Verify: `scripts/health-check.sh PROJECT_ID production`

### Feature Branch Development

1. Create branch: `upsun environment:branch new-feature -p PROJECT_ID`
2. Make changes and push: `upsun push -p PROJECT_ID -e new-feature`
3. Test on branch environment
4. Merge to parent: `upsun merge -p PROJECT_ID -e new-feature`
5. Delete branch: `upsun environment:delete -p PROJECT_ID -e new-feature`

### Environment Synchronization

1. Check status: `scripts/environment-status.sh PROJECT_ID staging`
2. Create backup: `upsun backup:create -p PROJECT_ID -e staging`
3. Sync from production: `upsun sync -p PROJECT_ID -e staging`
4. Verify: `scripts/health-check.sh PROJECT_ID staging`

## Getting Help
