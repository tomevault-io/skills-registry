# Memory — When, How, and Why

Gobby's memory system (gobby-memory MCP) stores persistent facts across sessions. Use progressive discovery for tool schemas — this skill teaches judgment, not API reference.

> **Note:** Claude Code's native memory system (~/.claude/projects/.../memory/) is disabled by Gobby rules.
> All memory operations go through **gobby-memory** MCP. Do not read or write to the native memory filesystem — those operations will be blocked.

## When to Use Memory

Memory is one of several persistence mechanisms. Pick the right one:

| What you learned | Store it as | Why |
|-----------------|-------------|-----|
| User preference or convention | **Memory** | Durable, cross-session, hard to rediscover |
| A bug or issue to fix | **Task** | Actionable, trackable, closeable |
| Implementation approach for current work | **Plan** | Scoped to conversation, structured |
| Something the code already shows | **Nothing** | Code is the source of truth |
| Something git log already shows | **Nothing** | Git is the source of truth |

**Rule of thumb**: Would rediscovering this require multi-step exploration in a future session? If yes, memorize it. If you can find it by reading code or running `git log`, don't.

## How to Write Durable Memories

Memories that survive are **specific, contextual, and time-resilient**.

**Good memories:**
- "Josh prefers squash merges from worktrees — a Gemini session once created hundreds of micro-commits"
- "The migration guard uses `_MIN_MIGRATION_VERSION` (171), not `BASELINE_VERSION`. They serve different purposes."
- "Pipeline bugs tracked in Linear project INGEST"

**Bad memories:**
- "The auth module is in src/gobby/auth/" — code structure changes; `find` is faster
- "Fixed bug in task validation" — the fix is in git; the commit message has context
- "Currently working on skill audit" — ephemeral, only relevant this session

**Durability test**: Will this be useful in 3 months? If the answer depends on code not changing, it's not durable.

## What to Remember

- **User preferences** — coding style, communication preferences, workflow choices
- **Conventions** — naming patterns, architectural decisions that aren't in docs
- **Non-obvious relationships** — "X depends on Y because of Z" where Z isn't documented
- **External references** — where to find things outside the repo (Linear projects, Slack channels, dashboards)
- **Design rationale** — why something was built a certain way, especially if counterintuitive

## What NOT to Remember

- **Code paths and file locations** — they change; use search tools
- **Recent git activity** — `git log` is authoritative
- **Bug fixes or solutions** — the fix is in the code, context in the commit
- **Anything in CLAUDE.md** — already loaded every session
- **Ephemeral state** — current task, temporary config, in-progress work

## Tags

Tags enable precise recall. Extract them from content:

| Content signal | Tag |
|---------------|-----|
| Testing, fixtures, pytest | `testing` |
| Security, auth, permissions | `security` |
| Architecture, design decisions | `architecture` |
| User preferences, conventions | `convention` |
| External systems, integrations | `reference` |

Use `tags_all` for AND queries, `tags_any` for OR, `tags_none` to exclude.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Memorizing tool schemas** — progressive discovery handles this; schemas go stale in memory
- **Memorizing code structure** — files move; grep/glob is faster and always current
- **Creating duplicate memories** — always search before creating; `create_memory` returns similar existing memories for exactly this reason
- **Storing one-time instructions as conventions** — only save if the user explicitly asked to remember, or if rediscovery would be expensive

## Maintenance

Memories decay. Periodically:

- **Audit** — find stale, duplicate, or code-derivable memories that should be cleaned up
- **Cleanup** — remove memories that are no longer accurate or useful
- **Rebuild cross-references** — keeps the relationship graph between memories fresh
- **Reindex embeddings** — improves semantic search quality after bulk changes

Use progressive discovery to find the maintenance tools on gobby-memory when needed.

## Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph extracts entities and relationships from memories into a searchable graph. Use it when you need to understand connections between concepts rather than searching for specific content.
