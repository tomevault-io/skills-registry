# /gobby plan - Implementation Planning Skill

Guide users through structured requirements gathering and specification writing.
**This skill creates the plan document only.** Use `/gobby expand <plan-file>` to create tasks.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Requirements Gathering** - Ask questions to understand the feature
2. **Draft Plan** - Write structured plan document
3. **Plan Verification** - Check for TDD anti-patterns and dependency issues
4. **User Approval** - Present plan for review
5. **Hand off to /gobby expand** - User runs `/gobby expand` on the plan file

## Step 0: **REQUIRED** ENTER PLAN MODE

Before creating any plan, you must enter Claude Code's plan mode to explore the codebase
and design the implementation approach.

**How to enter**: Use the `EnterPlanMode` tool or respond with a planning-focused message
that triggers plan mode. Plan mode allows you to read files and design without making edits.

**Why required**: Plan creation requires understanding existing code patterns, architecture
constraints, and dependencies before proposing new work.

## Step 1: Requirements Gathering

Ask the user:
1. "What is the name/title for this feature or project?"
2. "What is the high-level goal? (1-2 sentences)"
3. "Are there any constraints or requirements I should know about?"
4. "What are the unknowns or risks?"

## Step 2: Draft Plan Structure

Create a plan with:
- **Epic title**: The overall feature name
- **Phases**: Logical groupings of work (e.g., "Foundation", "Core Implementation", "Polish")
- **Tasks**: Atomic units of work under each phase
- **Dependencies**: Which tasks block which (use notation: `depends: #N` or `depends: Phase N`)

## Step 3: Write Plan Document

Write to `.gobby/plans/{kebab-name}.md`:

```markdown
# {Epic Title}

## Overview
{Goal and context from Step 1}

## Constraints
{Constraints from Step 1}

## Phase 1: {Phase Name}

**Goal**: {One sentence outcome}

### 1.1 {Task Title} [category: code]

Target: `src/module/file.py`

{Full implementation specification for this task. Everything here becomes the
subtask description during expansion — the implementing agent sees ONLY this section.}

Include:
- File paths to create/modify
- Code examples (classes, functions, schemas)
- Behavioral specs and edge cases
- SQL migrations, config snippets, etc.

```python
class Example(Base):
    """Show the shape of the solution with concrete code."""
    __tablename__ = "examples"

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), unique=True)

    def validate(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.name) > 0
```

### 1.2 {Task Title} [category: code] (depends: 1.1)

Target: `src/module/other.py`

{Full implementation specification — code examples, behavioral specs, edge cases...}

## Phase 2: {Phase Name}

**Goal**: {One sentence outcome}

### 2.1 {Task Title} [category: config] (depends: Phase 1)

Target: `config/settings.yaml`

{Full specification including config schema, defaults, validation rules...}

```yaml
settings:
  timeout: 30
  retries: 3
  # Show exact config structure the agent should produce
```

## Task Mapping

<!-- Updated after task creation -->
| Plan Item | Task Ref | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
```

**Dependency Notation:**
- Use `(depends: 1.1)` or `(depends: Phase N)` on task headings
- Dependencies are resolved when tasks are created via `create_task` with `parent_task_id`

## Plan Content = Subtask Descriptions

**Everything under a `### N.N` task heading becomes that subtask's description during expansion.**

When `/gobby expand` processes your plan, it extracts each `### N.N` section and uses its
full content as the subtask description. The implementing agent only sees its own subtask —
it does NOT have access to the full plan document.

**Each task section must be self-contained:**
- File paths to create or modify
- Code examples (classes, functions, method signatures)
- Config snippets, SQL migrations, YAML schemas
- ASCII diagrams, data flow descriptions
- Behavioral specs and edge cases
- Everything the implementing agent needs to do the work

**Do NOT defer detail.** If you know the model fields, list them. If you know the SQL
schema, write it. If you know the function signature, include it. Brief bullets like
"implement the user model" force the implementing agent to guess — and it will guess wrong.

## Step 4: Plan Verification (REQUIRED)

Before presenting to the user, verify the plan does NOT contain TDD anti-patterns:

### Check 1: No Explicit Test Tasks

Scan for tasks that should NOT exist (TDD sandwich creates these automatically):

**FORBIDDEN patterns - remove these if found:**
- `"Write tests for..."` or `"Add tests for..."`
- `"Test..."` as task title prefix
- `"[TDD]..."` or `"[IMPL]..."` or `"[REF]..."`
- `"Ensure tests pass"` or `"Run tests"`
- `"Add unit tests"` or `"Add integration tests"`
- Any task with `test` as the primary verb

**ALLOWED (these are fine):**
- `"Add TestClient fixture"` (not a test task, but test infrastructure)
- `"Configure pytest settings"` (configuration, not test writing)

### Check 2: Dependency Tree Validation

Verify the dependency structure is valid:

1. **No circular dependencies**: Task A → B → A is invalid
2. **No missing dependencies**: If Task B depends on Task A, Task A must exist
3. **Phase dependencies are valid**: `depends: Phase N` must reference an existing phase
4. **Leaf tasks are implementation work**: Bottom-level tasks should be concrete work, not meta-tasks

### Check 3: Task Categorization

Ensure each task has a valid category:
- `code` - Implementation tasks (gets TDD triplets)
- `config` - Configuration changes (gets TDD triplets)
- `docs` - Documentation tasks (no TDD)
- `refactor` - Refactoring tasks, including updating existing tests (no TDD)
- `test` - Test infrastructure (no TDD)
- `research` - Investigation tasks (no TDD)
- `planning` - Architecture/design (no TDD)
- `manual` - Manual verification (no TDD)

### Verification Output

After verification, report:
```
Plan Verification:
✓ No explicit test tasks found
✓ Dependency tree is valid (no cycles, all refs exist)
✓ Categories assigned correctly

Ready for user approval.
```

Or if issues found:
```
Plan Verification:
✗ Found 2 explicit test tasks (removed):
  - "Add tests for user authentication" → REMOVED
  - "Ensure all tests pass" → REMOVED
✓ Dependency tree is valid
✓ Categories assigned correctly

Plan updated. Ready for user approval.
```

## Step 5: User Approval & Handoff

Present the plan to the user:
- Show the full plan document
- Show verification results
- Ask: "Does this plan look correct? Would you like any changes?"
- Make changes if requested

Once approved, tell the user:
```
Plan approved! To create tasks from this plan, run:

/gobby expand <plan-file-path>

This will:
1. Create a root epic from the plan
2. Analyze the codebase for context
3. Generate subtasks with TDD instructions and validation criteria
4. Wire up dependencies
```

**This skill ends here.** Task creation is handled by `/gobby expand`.

## Plan Format Reference (for /gobby expand)

The following sections describe what `/gobby expand` expects and how it will process your plan.

## Task Granularity Guidelines

Each task should be:
- **Atomic**: Completable in one AI session
- **Testable**: Has clear pass/fail criteria
- **Verb-led**: Starts with action verb (Add, Create, Implement, Update, Remove)
- **Scoped**: References specific files/functions when possible
- **Self-contained**: Each task section contains ALL implementation detail the agent needs — code examples, schemas, file paths, and behavioral specs written directly in the section

Good: "Add TaskEnricher class to src/gobby/tasks/enrich.py"
Bad: "Implement enrichment" (too vague)

## TDD Compatibility (IMPORTANT)

When `/gobby expand` processes your plan, it applies TDD to each code/config task automatically.

### TDD Triplet Pattern

Each feature task (category: code) gets expanded into three children:
- **[TDD]** - Write failing tests first
- **[IMPL]** - Make tests pass
- **[REF]** - Refactor while keeping tests green

```
Feature Task
├── [TDD] Write failing tests for feature
├── [IMPL] Implement feature
└── [REF] Clean up, verify tests pass
```

### Task Categories

Valid categories (from `src/gobby/storage/tasks.py`):
- `code` - Implementation tasks (gets TDD triplets)
- `config` - Configuration changes (gets TDD triplets)
- `docs` - Documentation tasks (no TDD)
- `refactor` - Refactoring tasks, including updating existing tests (no TDD)
- `test` - Test infrastructure tasks (fixtures, helpers) (no TDD)
- `research` - Investigation tasks (no TDD)
- `planning` - Architecture/design tasks (no TDD)
- `manual` - Manual functional testing (observe output) (no TDD)

### What /gobby plan Creates vs What /gobby expand Creates

**Your plan document should contain:**
- Feature tasks with implied `category: code` or `category: config`
- Documentation tasks with implied `category: docs`
- Clear phase structure and dependencies

**Your plan should NOT contain:**
- `[TDD]`, `[IMPL]`, `[REF]` prefixed tasks
- "Write tests for: ..." tasks
- "Ensure tests pass" tasks
- Separate test tasks alongside implementation

**When you run `/gobby expand <plan-file>`:**

```
Input: .gobby/plans/memory-v3.md

Output task tree:
#100 [epic] Memory V3 Backend                      L1 (from plan title)
├── #101 [task] Create protocol.py                 L2 (from plan section 1.1)
│   └─ validation: Protocol class exists with required methods
│   └─ description: (47 lines — TDD header + full plan section content)
├── #102 [task] Create backends/__init__.py        L2 (from plan section 1.2)
│   └─ validation: Factory function works
│   └─ description: (32 lines — TDD header + full plan section content)
└── #103 [task] Add config schema                  L2 (from plan section 2.1)
    └─ validation: Config loads and validates
    └─ description: (28 lines — TDD header + full plan section content)
```

**NOTE**: `/gobby expand` adds a TDD header and preserves the full plan section content.
Rich descriptions (code examples, schemas, configs) flow through to subtasks unchanged.

## Example Usage

```
User: /gobby plan
Agent: "What feature would you like to plan?"
User: "Add dark mode support to the app"
Agent: [Asks clarifying questions]
Agent: [Writes plan to .gobby/plans/dark-mode.md]
Agent: [Runs verification - checks for TDD anti-patterns]
Agent: "Here's the plan. Does this look correct?"
User: "Yes, looks good"
Agent: "Plan approved! To create tasks, run:
        /gobby expand .gobby/plans/dark-mode.md"

User: /gobby expand .gobby/plans/dark-mode.md
Agent: [Creates epic, analyzes codebase, generates subtasks with TDD]
Agent: "Created 12 tasks under epic #47 with validation criteria."
```

## Optional: Workflow-Enforced Planning

For stricter enforcement of the planning process with step gates and tool restrictions,
you can activate the `plan-expansion` workflow instead of following this skill manually.

### When to Use the Workflow

Use the workflow when you want:
- **Hard step gates** - Can't proceed to task creation without approval
- **Tool restrictions** - Edit/Write blocked during discovery and gather phases
- **Loop enforcement** - Expansion loop can't be skipped or abandoned
- **State persistence** - Workflow state survives context compaction

### How to Activate

After gathering requirements (Step 1), activate the workflow:

```python
call_tool("gobby-workflows", "activate_workflow", {
    "name": "plan-expansion",
    "variables": {
        "context_analyzed": false,  # Start from discovery
        "apc_choice": null
    }
})
```

Or skip discovery if you've already analyzed the codebase:

```python
call_tool("gobby-workflows", "activate_workflow", {
    "name": "plan-expansion",
    "step": "gather",  # Start from requirements elicitation
    "variables": {
        "context_analyzed": true
    }
})
```

### Workflow Steps

1. **discover** - Analyze existing context (blocks Edit/Write)
2. **gather** - A/P/C elicitation menu (blocks Edit/Write)
3. **draft_plan** - Write plan document (only .gobby/plans/ allowed)
4. **verify_plan** - Check structure and dependencies
5. **create_hierarchy** - Create epic → phase → task structure
6. **expand_loop** - Auto-expand feature tasks with TDD
7. **cleanup** - Evaluate tree, fix deps, identify duplicates, offer cleanup
8. **verify_tasks** - Confirm task tree and update plan
9. **complete** - Workflow finished

### Hybrid Approach

The skills and workflow are complementary:
- **`/gobby plan`**: Interactive flexibility for requirements and drafting
- **`/gobby expand`**: Creates tasks with TDD and validation
- **Workflow**: Deterministic expansion with enforced gates

Recommended pattern:
1. Use `/gobby plan` for Steps 1-5 (requirements through approval)
2. Use `/gobby expand <plan-file>` to create tasks
3. Or activate `plan-expansion` workflow for stricter enforcement
