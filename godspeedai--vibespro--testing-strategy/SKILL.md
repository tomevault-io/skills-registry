# Testing Strategy Skill

This skill ensures that new features are accompanied by robust tests across the testing pyramid.

## Steps

1. **Review context.** Load `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to understand the system
   architecture, critical paths and existing testing conventions.

2. **Plan test coverage.** Determine which layers of the testing pyramid apply:
   - **Unit tests** for individual functions or classes.
   - **Integration tests** for interactions between modules or services.
   - **End‑to‑end tests** for verifying user-facing workflows.

3. **Identify key scenarios.** For each requirement or plan step, outline the positive,
   negative and edge case scenarios that must be tested. Consider performance and security
   aspects where applicable.

4. **Select frameworks and tools.** Choose appropriate testing frameworks (e.g. pytest for
   Python, Jest for JS/TS) and any mocking or fixture libraries. Ensure tests can run in
   isolation and in CI.

5. **Write and organise tests.** Implement the tests following language-specific best
   practices. Place them in clearly named files and directories. Use descriptive test
   names and assertions.

6. **Run and iterate.** Execute the tests locally. Fix any failing tests or code issues.
   Ensure the entire suite passes quickly. Address flakiness or excessive coupling.

7. **Validate and summarise.** Run the validation task to ensure no structural issues were
   introduced. Summarise the new tests and their coverage. Highlight any remaining gaps for
   future work.

Embedding testing as a first-class activity guarantees reliability and facilitates confident
refactoring.
