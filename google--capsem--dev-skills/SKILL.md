# AI Agent Skills System

This documents everything we know about how skills work across Claude Code and Gemini CLI, learned from building and organizing this project's 18+ skills. This knowledge will inform Capsem's own skills system for guest AI agents.

## Discovery

### Claude Code
- Looks in `.claude/skills/` (project) and `~/.claude/skills/` (global)
- Discovers `<name>/SKILL.md` -- one level of nesting only
- Nested directories (e.g., `category/skill/SKILL.md`) are NOT discovered
- Symlinks work -- we use `.claude/skills -> ../skills` to share with Gemini
- Live reload on file change, no restart needed

### Gemini CLI
- Looks in `.agents/skills/` or `.gemini/skills/`
- Same `<name>/SKILL.md` format as Claude Code
- We use `.agents/skills -> ../skills` symlink

### What does NOT work
- Nested categories: `skills/dev/testing/SKILL.md` is not found by either CLI
- Files named anything other than `SKILL.md` in a directory are not discovered as skills
- Files directly in the skills root (not in a subdirectory) are not discovered

## SKILL.md format

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: When to trigger and what it does. Be specific and pushy -- Claude undertriggers.
---

# Skill Title

Instructions the agent follows when triggered.
```

### Frontmatter fields
- `name` (required) -- skill identifier, should match directory name
- `description` (required) -- this is the PRIMARY trigger mechanism. Claude sees name + description in its skill list and decides whether to load the full body. Everything about "when to use" goes here.
- `user-invocable: true` -- lets users invoke with `/skill-name`
- `allowed-tools` -- restrict which tools the skill can use
- `context: fork` -- run in a subagent

### Description is everything for triggering

Claude undertriggers skills by default. Descriptions must be:
- Specific about WHAT the skill does
- Explicit about WHEN to use it (list concrete contexts, phrases, file types)
- Slightly pushy -- "Use this whenever X, even if Y" style

Bad: "Frontend development guide"
Good: "Capsem frontend design system. Use when building UI components, styling views, working with the design system, choosing colors, or understanding the component library."

## Progressive disclosure

Three loading tiers:
1. **Metadata** (~100 words) -- name + description, always in context for every conversation
2. **SKILL.md body** (<500 lines ideal) -- loaded when skill triggers
3. **Bundled resources** (unlimited) -- `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/` subdirs, loaded on demand

This means: keep SKILL.md lean. Put detailed wire formats, API docs, and large references in `references/` with clear pointers from the SKILL.md body.

## Organization: prefix-based grouping

Flat directory structure with naming convention for categories:

```
skills/
  dev-testing/SKILL.md          dev category
  dev-debugging/SKILL.md        dev category
  build-images/SKILL.md         build category
  release-process/SKILL.md      release category
  meta-find-skills/SKILL.md     meta category
```

Categories we use: `meta-*`, `dev-*`, `build-*`, `release-*`, `site-*`, `frontend-*`.

## Bundled resources pattern

```
skill-name/
  SKILL.md                      Main instructions (<500 lines)
  references/
    wire-format.md              Detailed protocol docs
    community-skill.md          Fetched from npx skills / GitHub
  scripts/
    helper.sh                   Executable automation
  assets/
    template.html               Templates, icons
```

Reference from SKILL.md with: "Read `references/wire-format.md` for the full protocol details."

## Community skills

The `npx skills` CLI (skills.sh) discovers community skills. To use one:

```bash
npx skills find <query>          # Search
# Then manually fetch and place:
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/<path>/SKILL.md \
  -o skills/<name>/references/<topic>.md
```

We place community skills as references (not top-level SKILL.md) because:
- They're context for our skills, not standalone triggers
- Our SKILL.md provides the project-specific framing
- Community skills may have generic advice that conflicts with our conventions

Quality bar: prefer official sources (anthropics/, sveltejs/, google-gemini/) or 1K+ installs. Verify content before bundling.

## Global skills

Skills in `~/.claude/skills/` are available across all projects. We install meta skills globally:
- `meta-find-skills` -- discover community skills
- `meta-organize-skills` -- skill conventions
- `meta-skill-creation` -- create/iterate skills

## Lessons learned

1. **Nested directories don't work** for skill discovery. Use prefix naming instead.
2. **Description quality drives triggering accuracy.** Vague descriptions = skill never loads.
3. **Wire format docs belong in references/**, not in the main SKILL.md. Keep the body actionable.
4. **Write references from source code**, not from memory. API wire formats drift and memory gets stale.
5. **One skill per concern.** MCP and MITM proxy are separate skills even though both handle network traffic -- they have different trigger conditions.
6. **Cross-reference between skills** using "See dev-testing-vm for..." style pointers in the body.
7. **Skills load on demand** -- having 18 skills costs nothing when they're not triggered. Don't try to merge skills to save space.
8. **Both CLIs read the same format.** SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter works for Claude Code and Gemini CLI. No duplication needed.
