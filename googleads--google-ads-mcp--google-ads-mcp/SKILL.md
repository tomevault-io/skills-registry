# Account Performance Diagnostics Skill

This skill provides instructions on how to use the Google Ads MCP server to diagnose common account performance issues.

## Workflows

### 1. Conversion and Conversion Value Loss

When conversions or conversion value suddenly decline, use the following steps to diagnose the issue.

**Steps:**
1.  **Discover Fields**: Use `get_resource_metadata` with resource `campaign` or `ad_group` to ensure you have the correct field names.
2.  **Query Performance**: Use `search` to retrieve performance data.
    *   **Resource**: `campaign` or `ad_group`
    *   **Fields**: Include `campaign.name`, `metrics.conversions`, `metrics.conversion_value`, `metrics.cost_micros`.
    *   **Segments**: To isolate the loss, include segments like `segments.date`, `segments.device`, `segments.conversion_action`.
    *   **Conditions**: Compare the period of decline with a previous period (e.g., `segments.date >= 'YYYY-MM-DD'`).
3.  **Analyze**: Check if the loss is limited to certain devices (e.g., mobile vs desktop) or specific conversion actions.
4.  **Check Uploads**: If using offline conversions, consider checking `offline_conversion_upload_conversion_action_summary` for upload issues.

### 2. Opportunities Lost (Impression Share)

To identify lost opportunities due to ad rank, bids, or budgets, analyze impression share metrics.

**Steps:**
1.  **Query Impression Share**: Use `search` to retrieve impression share metrics.
    *   **Resource**: `campaign`
    *   **Fields**: `campaign.name`, `metrics.search_impression_share`, `metrics.search_rank_lost_impression_share`, `metrics.search_budget_lost_impression_share`.
2.  **Analyze**:
    *   High `search_budget_lost_impression_share` indicates opportunities lost due to limited budget.
    *   High `search_rank_lost_impression_share` indicates opportunities lost due to low ad rank (bid or quality issues).

### 3. Low Lead Flow Diagnostics

When a user asks "why is my lead flow low these past few days?", follow this systematic approach.

**Steps:**
1.  **Confirm Drop**: Query conversions segmented by date for the last few days vs the previous period.
2.  **Isolate Cause**:
    *   Check if **Traffic** (clicks, impressions) dropped.
    *   Check if **Conversion Rate** (conversions/clicks) dropped.
3.  **If Traffic Dropped**: Check Impression Share metrics (see Workflow 2) to see if it's a budget or rank issue, or if search volume generally declined.
4.  **If Conversion Rate Dropped**: Check breakdowns by `segments.device` or `segments.conversion_action` to see if a specific area is failing.
5.  **Check Changes**: Query the `change_event` resource to see if any changes were made to bids, budgets, or targeting around the time the drop started.
    *   *Note*: Queries to `change_event` must specify a LIMIT of less than or equal to 10000.
