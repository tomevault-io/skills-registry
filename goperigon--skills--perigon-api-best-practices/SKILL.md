# Perigon API Best Practices

Comprehensive guide for building with the Perigon News Intelligence API. Covers all endpoints, query patterns, and integration best practices.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Searching or filtering news articles by keyword, topic, category, date, source, sentiment, or location
- Tracking evolving news stories and clustered article groups
- Generating AI-powered summaries of news coverage
- Performing semantic/vector search over news articles or Wikipedia content
- Querying the Wikipedia knowledge base for structured page data
- Looking up people, companies, journalists, or media sources
- Browsing available topics and categories
- Building dashboards, alerts, or monitoring tools powered by news data
- Integrating Perigon into any application or AI agent workflow

## API Overview

**Base URL:** `https://api.perigon.io`

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/v1/articles/all` | GET | Search and filter news articles with rich parameters |
| `/v1/stories/all` | GET | Clustered news stories with summaries and metadata |
| `/v1/stories/history` | GET | Story evolution history with changelogs and snapshots |
| `/v1/summarize` | POST | AI-powered summarization over matched articles |
| `/v1/vector/news/all` | POST | Semantic/vector search over news articles |
| `/v1/wikipedia/all` | GET | Search and filter Wikipedia pages |
| `/v1/vector/wikipedia/all` | POST | Semantic/vector search over Wikipedia content |
| `/v1/people/all` | GET | People mentioned in the news (650k+ database) |
| `/v1/companies/all` | GET | Company data with financial metadata |
| `/v1/journalists/all` | GET | Journalist profiles (230k+ database) |
| `/v1/journalists/{id}` | GET | Single journalist by ID |
| `/v1/sources/all` | GET | Media sources database (200k+ sources) |
| `/v1/topics/all` | GET | Topics taxonomy browser |

## Authentication

The API key can be passed in two ways:
1. **Query parameter:** `?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY`
2. **Header:** `x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY`

**Best practices:**
- Store the API key in an environment variable (e.g., `PERIGON_API_KEY`). Never hardcode it.
- Prefer the header method (`x-api-key`) to keep keys out of URLs and logs.
- Get your API key at [perigon.io](https://www.perigon.io/).

## Endpoint Selection Guide

Choose the right endpoint based on the task:

```
Need individual articles? → /v1/articles/all
Need grouped stories with summaries? → /v1/stories/all
Need to track how a story evolves over time? → /v1/stories/history
Need an AI-generated summary of coverage? → /v1/summarize
Need semantic similarity search for news? → /v1/vector/news/all
Need Wikipedia knowledge? → /v1/wikipedia/all
Need semantic search over Wikipedia? → /v1/vector/wikipedia/all
Need person/company/journalist/source info? → /v1/people|companies|journalists|sources/all
Need to browse available topics? → /v1/topics/all
```

## Core Query Patterns

### Text Search (`q` parameter)
The `q` parameter searches across title, description, and content. It supports:
- **Boolean operators:** `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- **Exact phrases:** `"climate change"`
- **Wildcards:** `*` (multiple chars), `?` (single char)
- **Combining:** `"electric vehicles" AND (Tesla OR Rivian) NOT recalls`

### Date Filtering
- `from` / `to` — Filter by publication date (ISO 8601 or `yyyy-mm-dd`)
- `addDateFrom` / `addDateTo` — Filter by ingestion date
- `refreshDateFrom` / `refreshDateTo` — Filter by last-updated date

### Pagination
- `page` — Page number (starts at 0)
- `size` — Results per page
- Set `showNumResults=true` to get total counts (slightly slower)

### Sentiment Filtering
Filter by sentiment scores (0.0 to 1.0):
- `positiveSentimentFrom` / `positiveSentimentTo`
- `negativeSentimentFrom` / `negativeSentimentTo`
- `neutralSentimentFrom` / `neutralSentimentTo`

### Array Filters (OR logic)
Many filters accept arrays and combine with OR logic:
`category`, `topic`, `source`, `language`, `country`, `label`, `personName`, `companyDomain`, `companySymbol`, `journalistId`, `medium`, `sourceGroup`

### Exclude Filters (AND-exclude logic)
Prefix any array filter with `exclude` to remove matches:
`excludeCategory`, `excludeTopic`, `excludeSource`, `excludeLanguage`, etc.

## Vector Search (Semantic)

For natural language queries that don't map well to keyword search, use the vector endpoints:

**News:** `POST /v1/vector/news/all` — searches articles from the last 6 months by semantic similarity.

**Wikipedia:** `POST /v1/vector/wikipedia/all` — searches Wikipedia page sections by semantic similarity.

Both accept a `prompt` (natural language query), `page`, `size`, and a `filter` object for structured filtering with nested `AND`/`OR`/`NOT` logic.

## How to Use References

Read individual reference files for detailed endpoint documentation:

```
references/authentication.md        — API key setup and security
references/articles-search.md       — /v1/articles/all deep dive
references/stories-clustering.md    — /v1/stories/all deep dive
references/stories-history.md       — /v1/stories/history deep dive
references/smart-summaries.md       — /v1/summarize deep dive
references/vector-search.md         — /v1/vector/news/all and /v1/vector/wikipedia/all
references/wikipedia-knowledge.md   — /v1/wikipedia/all deep dive
references/people-companies.md      — /v1/people/all and /v1/companies/all
references/journalists-sources.md   — /v1/journalists/all and /v1/sources/all
references/topics-categories.md     — /v1/topics/all and category taxonomy
references/pagination-filtering.md  — Common query patterns and pagination
references/error-handling.md        — HTTP status codes and retry logic
references/rate-limits.md           — Rate limit management
```

Each reference file contains:
- Endpoint URL and HTTP method
- All query/body parameters with types and descriptions
- Example requests (curl) and response JSON
- Common patterns and best practices
- When to use this endpoint vs. alternatives

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start narrow, then broaden** — Use specific filters first, then relax constraints if results are too few.
2. **Prefer `from`/`to` over `addDateFrom`/`addDateTo`** for publication-date filtering unless you specifically need ingestion-date filtering.
3. **Use `showReprints=false`** to deduplicate wire-service content (AP, Reuters) that appears on multiple sites.
4. **Use `sourceGroup`** (e.g., `top100`, `top25tech`) for quality-filtered results.
5. **Combine endpoints** — Use `/v1/stories/all` to find story clusters, then `/v1/articles/all` with `clusterId` for all articles in a story.
6. **Use vector search for intent-based queries** — When the user's query is conversational or conceptual rather than keyword-based.
7. **Use Wikipedia endpoints for factual background** — Combine with news search to enrich coverage with encyclopedic context.
8. **Handle pagination properly** — Always check `numResults` and iterate pages when building comprehensive datasets.
9. **Cache strategically** — News data changes frequently, but entity data (people, companies, sources) changes slowly.
10. **Respect rate limits** — Implement exponential backoff on 429 responses.
