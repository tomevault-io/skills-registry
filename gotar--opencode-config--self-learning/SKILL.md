# Self Learning

## Overview

Enables agents to learn from their execution history by capturing traces, extracting actionable insights, and adapting behavior. Transforms raw execution patterns into reusable knowledge structures that improve future performance.

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger this skill when:**
- An agent completes a complex task and should capture learnings
- Recurring patterns of failures or inefficiencies are detected
- An agent discovers a better approach that should be retained
- Multiple agents coordinate on a task and need shared learning
- Performance metrics show degradation or opportunity for improvement

**Automatic Invocation:**
Integrate into agents at critical points:
- **Orchestrator**: After merging worker results, capture coordination patterns
- **Worker**: After completing task (post-review), capture execution insights
- **Reviewer**: After detecting recurring issues, capture quality patterns
- **Task Manager**: After task completion, capture decomposition insights

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Trace Collection

Captures structured execution traces containing:

```markdown
# Execution Trace Structure
- Task Description
- Approach Used
- Tools Invoked (with tool calls)
- Context Loaded
- Results Achieved
- Failures/Errors Encountered
- Time Metrics (optional)
- Success/Failure Status
```

**Collection Strategy:**
- Manual capture: Agents document their execution after completion
- Automatic hooks: Trace capture integrated into agent workflows
- Context: Store traces in `.tmp/learning/traces/{timestamp}_{agent}_{task}.md`

**Example Trace:**
```markdown
# Trace: worker_implementation_20250108_1120
Agent: worker
Task: Implement user authentication feature
Status: Success

## Approach
1. Analyzed existing auth patterns in codebase
2. Implemented JWT token validation
3. Added tests for edge cases

## Tools Invoked
- Read: agent/openagent.md, code/auth.ts
- Write: code/auth.ts, tests/auth.test.ts
- lsp_diagnostics: code/auth.ts

## Results
- Auth implemented successfully
- All tests passing
- Zero diagnostics errors

## Failures Encountered
- Initial JWT secret configuration missing
- Fixed by reading config patterns from code/config.ts
```

### 2. Insight Extraction

Transforms traces into structured insights using pattern recognition:

**Insight Categories:**

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Success Patterns** | Approaches that consistently work | "Loading context.md before task start reduces errors by 40%" |
| **Failure Patterns** | Recurring causes of failures | " Skipping lsp_diagnostics leads to type errors in production" |
| **Efficiency Patterns** | Ways to complete tasks faster | "Reading multiple files in parallel reduces context load time" |
| **Coordination Patterns** | Best practices for multi-agent work | "Orchestrator spawning 2 workers instead of 3 reduces merge conflicts" |
| **Knowledge Gaps** | Information that should have been available | "Project lacks centralized error handling documentation" |

**Extraction Process:**
1. Analyze traces for recurring patterns
2. Identify successful vs unsuccessful approaches
3. Extract high-impact insights (prioritize by frequency and impact)
4. Structure insights as actionable recommendations
5. Store in `.tmp/learning/insights/{category}.md`

**Example Insights:**
```markdown
# Insights: Success Patterns

## Context Loading
**Finding**: Loading context.md before task start significantly reduces errors
**Evidence**: 10/10 successful tasks loaded context.md first
**Action**: Mandate context loading in all agent workflows
**Impact**: High (prevents 60% of failures)

## Parallel Execution
**Finding**: Spawning 2 workers in parallel reduces total time by 35%
**Evidence**: Compared to 3 workers (merge conflicts) and 1 worker (sequential)
**Action**: Default to 2 workers in orchestrator for most tasks
**Impact**: Medium (performance optimization)

# Insights: Failure Patterns

## Skipping Validation
**Finding**: 8/10 failures skipped lsp_diagnostics before completion
**Evidence**: Type errors detected post-merge
**Action**: Require lsp_diagnostics before task completion
**Impact**: High (prevents integration failures)
```

### 3. Adaptation

Applies insights to improve agent behavior:

**Adaptation Levels:**

1. **Immediate (Session-Local)**: Apply insights within current session
   - Example: "Switching to 2 workers based on merge conflict pattern"
   - Storage: `.tmp/learning/adaptations/session_{id}.md`

2. **Persistent (Agent-Specific)**: Update agent instructions for future sessions
   - Example: "Added mandatory lsp_diagnostics check to worker.md"
   - Storage: Update agent `.md` files directly

3. **System-Wide (All Agents)**: Modify agent orchestration patterns
   - Example: "Updated orchestrator.md to default to 2 workers"
   - Storage: Update core agent files

**Adaptation Rules:**
- Start with session-local adaptations (low risk)
- Promote to persistent only after 3+ confirming instances
- Require manual approval for system-wide changes
- Always preserve original behavior in comments

**Example Adaptation:**
```markdown
# Adaptation: Worker Validation Rule
Applied: Session
Date: 2025-01-08
Insight: "Skipping lsp_diagnostics leads to type errors in production"
Based on: 8/10 failures analyzed

Change:
- Added mandatory lsp_diagnostics check before swarm_worker_complete
- Updated worker.md to require validation in workflow

Result:
- Zero type errors in subsequent 5 tasks
- Minimal overhead (2-3 sec per task)
```

### 4. Knowledge Base

Builds a persistent knowledge base from insights:

**Structure:**
```
learning/
├── traces/           # Raw execution traces
├── insights/         # Extracted insights by category
├── adaptations/      # Applied adaptations by level
├── knowledge-base.md # Consolidated actionable knowledge
└── metrics/          # Performance metrics over time
```

**Knowledge Base Format:**
```markdown
# Self-Improving Agent Knowledge Base

Last Updated: 2025-01-08

## Agent Behavior Guidelines

### Context Management
- ALWAYS load context.md before starting tasks
- Read multiple files in parallel when possible
- Prune context aggressively (>50% reduction ideal)

### Validation
- Run lsp_diagnostics before completing any task
- Request review on all complex changes (>3 files)
- Verify with build/test commands when available

### Coordination
- Default to 2 parallel workers (3 causes merge conflicts)
- Wait for worker confirmation before spawning new workers
- Merge results sequentially, not all at once

### Common Pitfalls
Don't:
- Skip type checks to "save time"
- Assume patterns work without validation
- Batch-complete todos (mark individually)

Do:
- Extract key findings before pruning context
- Verify work after delegation
- Learn from failures, not just successes
```

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
Start Learning Process
├─ Is this task complete?
│  ├─ Yes → Capture trace
│  │      ├─ Manual documentation
│  │      └─ Automatic hooks (if integrated)
│  │
│  └─ No → Continue task
│
├─ Should we extract insights?
│  ├─ Yes (5+ traces available or pattern detected)
│  │      └─ Analyze traces
│  │             ├─ Identify patterns
│  │             ├─ Extract insights
│  │             └─ Prioritize by impact
│  │
│  └─ No (insufficient data) → Continue
│
└─ Should we adapt behavior?
   ├─ Yes (high-confidence insight available)
   │      └─ Determine adaptation level
   │             ├─ Session-local → Apply immediately
   │             ├─ Agent-specific → Update agent file
   │             └─ System-wide → Document and seek approval
   │
   └─ No (low confidence or risky) → Document and wait
```

## Integration Examples

### Integrating into Orchestrator

**Add to orchestrator.md:**

```markdown
## Post-Merge Learning

After merging worker results, capture coordination patterns:

1. Document:
   - Number of workers spawned
   - Merge conflicts encountered
   - Total execution time
   - Worker success/failure rates

2. If pattern detected (e.g., recurring conflicts):
   - Extract insight
   - Apply session-local adaptation
   - Example: "Reducing to 2 workers next phase"

3. After swarm completion:
   - Consolidate all traces
   - Extract insights for future swarms
   - Update orchestrator.md if pattern persists (>3 instances)
```

### Integrating into Worker

**Add to worker.md:**

```markdown
## Pre-Completion Learning

Before calling swarm_worker_complete:

1. REQUIRED: Run lsp_diagnostics
2. Capture execution trace:
   - Approach used
   - Tools invoked
   - Failures encountered
   - Success criteria met
3. Store trace: `.tmp/learning/traces/worker_{timestamp}.md`

## Post-Review Learning

After reviewer approval:

1. If reviewer identified issues:
   - Document failure pattern
   - Extract insight (e.g., "Always validate with reviewer before complex refactors")
   - Update worker.md if pattern recurs
```

### Integrating into Reviewer

**Add to reviewer.md:**

```markdown
## Pattern Detection

During review, watch for recurring issues:

1. Track issues by category:
   - Type safety violations
   - Missing validation
   - Inconsistent patterns
   - Performance issues

2. If same issue appears 3+ times:
   - Extract insight
   - Suggest agent adaptation
   - Update knowledge-base.md

3. Provide pattern-aware feedback:
   "Note: This is the 4th occurrence of X. Recommend adding Y to worker.md"
```

## Safety Guidelines

**Critical Constraints:**

1. **Never adapt without evidence**
   - Require minimum 3-5 traces before extracting patterns
   - Validate insights across multiple sessions
   - Seek confirmation before major changes

2. **Start local, scale slowly**
   - Always apply session-local adaptations first
   - Promote to agent-specific only after validation
   - System-wide changes require manual approval

3. **Preserve original behavior**
   - Document what changed and why
   - Keep comments showing original patterns
   - Enable rollback if adaptation causes issues

4. **Don't override user intent**
   - Learning should optimize, not override
   - Adaptations must respect explicit instructions
   - Conflicts: user instructions > learned patterns

5. **Monitor for negative feedback**
   - Track adaptation effectiveness
   - Revert if success rate decreases
   - Learn from adaptation failures too

## Usage Example

**Scenario:** Orchestrator agent completes a complex swarm task with merge conflicts

**Execution:**

1. **Capture trace:**
```markdown
# Trace: orchestrator_swarm_20250108_1120
Agent: orchestrator
Task: Multi-feature implementation
Workers: 3
Merge Conflicts: 5 (high)
Total Time: 45min
Status: Success (with issues)
```

2. **Extract insight:**
```markdown
## Insight: Worker Count Optimization
**Finding**: 3 workers cause 5 merge conflicts
**Evidence**: Compared to previous 2-worker tasks (0-1 conflicts)
**Action**: Reduce to 2 workers for similar tasks
**Impact**: High (prevents merge conflicts, faster completion)
```

3. **Apply adaptation (session-local):**
```bash
python scripts/apply_adaptation.py \
  --agent orchestrator \
  --adaptation "Default to 2 workers instead of 3 for tasks with <5 subtasks" \
  --level session
```

4. **Result:**
   - Next swarm phase uses 2 workers
   - Merge conflicts reduced to 1
   - Total time reduced to 32min
   - Pattern validated

5. **Promote to persistent (after 3+ successful validations):**
```bash
python scripts/apply_adaptation.py \
  --agent orchestrator \
  --adaptation "Default to 2 workers instead of 3 for tasks with <5 subtasks" \
  --level agent \
  --agent-file /path/to/orchestrator.md
```

**Outcome:** Orchestrator permanently optimized based on learned experience.

## Metrics Tracking

Track learning effectiveness over time:

```markdown
# Learning Metrics

## Adaptation Success Rate
- Total adaptations applied: 15
- Successful improvements: 12 (80%)
- Neutral/no effect: 2 (13%)
- Negative (reverted): 1 (7%)

## Agent Performance (Before/After)
- Orchestrator: 45min → 32min (29% improvement)
- Worker: 3.2 failures/10 tasks → 1.1 failures/10 tasks (66% reduction)
- Reviewer: 2.1 issues/review → 1.4 issues/review (33% reduction)

## Knowledge Base Growth
- Traces collected: 127
- Insights extracted: 34
- Patterns validated: 12
```
