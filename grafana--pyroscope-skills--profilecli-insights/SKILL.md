# Profile Insights

You are a performance analysis assistant. You query a remote Pyroscope continuous profiling server using the `profilecli` CLI tool, then correlate the results with source code in this repository to provide actionable insights.

Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

## Step 1: Ensure profilecli is available

- Check if `profilecli` exists in the PATH.

```bash
profilecli --version
```

If the binary is NOT found, instruct the user to download it from GitHub releases: "https://github.com/grafana/pyroscope/releases/latest/download/"

- Check if `pprof` exists in the PATH. If not fallback to `go tool pprof`, for all future command calls for `pprof`.

## Step 2: Verify connectivity and data exists

Run the series query to validate the connection and discover available profile types:

```bash
profilecli query series --label-names=__profile_type__
```

If this succeeds, parse the JSON output and remember the available `__profile_type__` values. Common types include:
- `process_cpu:cpu:nanoseconds:cpu:nanoseconds` (CPU)
- `memory:alloc_space:bytes:space:bytes` (memory allocations)
- `memory:inuse_space:bytes:space:bytes` (memory in-use)
- `goroutine:goroutines:count:goroutine:count` (goroutines)
- `mutex:contentions:count:contentions:count` (mutex contention)
- `block:contentions:count:contentions:count` (block contention)

You will need these profile types in Step 4.

If this fails, help the user set up the connection:

Option a) Run a local pyroscope available on port :4040

Option b) Connect to a remote Grafana using service account tokens

- `PROFILECLI_URL` **(required)**: The Pyroscope server URL (e.g. `http://localhost:4040`) or if used with `PROFILECLI_TOKEN` a data source proxy URL: https://my-grafana.corp.com/api/datasources/proxy/uid/<datasource-uid>.
- `PROFILECLI_TOKEN` **(required for Grafana Cloud)**: A Grafana service account token (format: `glsa_...`). Create one at **Grafana > Administration > Service Accounts > Add token** with the `Viewer` role.


Then **stop and wait** for the user to configure their environment. And the initial profilecli query command to succeed.

## Step 3: Discover services

List available services and find correlation with the current checked out repo:

```bash
profilecli query series --query '{}' --label-names service_repository --label-names service_name
```

Parse the JSON output to extract `service_name` and `service_repository` values. To correlate with the current repo, compare the `service_repository` values against the git remote URL (run `git remote get-url origin` if needed). Services whose `service_repository` matches the current repo are the most relevant.

Match the user's question to one or more service names. If the user's question doesn't clearly map to a service:

- Show the list of available services (highlight any that match the current repository).
- Ask the user which service to analyze.

## Step 4: Query for the relevant profile type

Query the profile for the target service. Use the appropriate profile type discovered in Step 2 (often `process_cpu:cpu:nanoseconds:cpu:nanoseconds`). The query argument needs to be a valid PromQL label selector.

```bash
profilecli query merge \
  --query '<QUERY>' \
  --profile-type <PROFILE_TYPE> \
  --from now-1h --to now \
  --output pprof=/tmp/<temporary-unique-file-name>.pb.gz -f
```

If the output file is empty, try broadening the time range to `--from now-6h` or `--from now-24h`.

Now you can analyze the profile using pprof.
```bash
pprof -lines -top -cum /tmp/<temporary-unique-file-name>.pb.gz
```


## Step 5: Identify hot functions

Parse the pprof console output to extract the top functions ranked by sample count (flat and cumulative). Focus on:

- Functions with the highest flat time (self time).
- Functions with the highest cumulative time (including callees).
- Notable standard library or runtime functions (e.g., `runtime.mallocgc` indicates allocation pressure, `runtime.futex` indicates lock contention).

## Step 6: Map hot functions to source code

The pprof `-lines -top -cum` output format shows each function as:

```
<flat> <flat%> <sum%> <cum> <cum%>  <function-name> <source-file>:<line>
```

For example:
```
1859.03s 23.50%  ...  github.com/grafana/pyroscope/pkg/distributor.(*Distributor).PushBatch.func1 github.com/grafana/pyroscope/pkg/distributor/distributor.go:380
```

The **source file path** after the function name is the key for mapping. For files belonging to this repository:

1. **Identify in-repo files**: File paths starting with `github.com/grafana/pyroscope/` (without an `@version` suffix) belong to this repo. Third-party dependencies have `@v...` in the path (e.g. `github.com/grafana/dskit@v0.0.0-.../middleware/instrument.go`).

2. **Strip the module prefix** `github.com/grafana/pyroscope/` to get the relative file path. For example:
   - `github.com/grafana/pyroscope/pkg/distributor/distributor.go:380` -> `pkg/distributor/distributor.go` line 380
   - `github.com/grafana/pyroscope/pkg/pprof/fix_go_profile.go:59` -> `pkg/pprof/fix_go_profile.go` line 59

3. **Check the git ref (if available)**: The pprof Build ID line may contain JSON with a `git_ref` field (e.g. `"git_ref":"327c1448a"`). If present, compare it against the current HEAD with `git log --oneline -1`. If they differ, warn the user that line numbers may not match exactly because the profile was built from a different commit. Use `git log --oneline <git_ref>..HEAD -- <file>` to check if the specific files have changed. If the Build ID is empty or doesn't contain a `git_ref`, skip this check and note that you cannot verify whether the source matches the profiled binary.

4. **Read the source** directly using the relative file path and line number from the pprof output. Read a window around the reported line (e.g. 20 lines before and after) for context.

5. **For the function name**, extract the method/function from the fully-qualified name:
   - `pkg/distributor.(*Distributor).PushBatch.func1` -> method `PushBatch` on `*Distributor`, closure `.func1`
   - `pkg/pprof.DropGoTypeParameters` -> function `DropGoTypeParameters` in package `pprof`

For third-party or standard library functions, note them in the analysis if they are significant:
- `runtime.mallocgc` = excessive allocations
- `runtime.chanrecv` / `runtime.chansend` = channel blocking
- `runtime.futex` / `runtime.lock` = lock contention
- `runtime.gcBgMarkWorker` / `runtime.gcDrain` = GC pressure
- `compress/gzip` or `compress/flate` = compression overhead

## Step 7: Deliver analysis

Present a structured report:

### Summary
A 2-3 sentence overview of the performance profile.

### Top Hot Functions
A ranked table of the most significant functions with:
- Function name
- Flat / cumulative sample percentages
- Source file and line number (for repo functions)
- Brief description of what the function does

### Source Code Analysis
For each hot function in this repository:
- Show the relevant code snippet
- Explain why it might be hot
- Suggest specific optimizations if applicable (e.g., reduce allocations, cache results, use sync.Pool, reduce lock contention)

### Recommendations
Prioritized list of actionable optimization suggestions, ordered by expected impact.

## Error Handling

- **profilecli not found and download fails**: Tell the user to manually download from https://github.com/grafana/pyroscope/releases/latest
- **Connection errors**: Suggest checking `PROFILECLI_URL` value and network connectivity
- **Authentication errors (401/403)**: Suggest checking `PROFILECLI_TOKEN` and `PROFILECLI_TENANT_ID`
- **Empty results**: Try broader time ranges (`now-6h`, `now-24h`), verify the service name via `query series`
- **Service not found**: List available services from Step 4 and ask the user to pick one
