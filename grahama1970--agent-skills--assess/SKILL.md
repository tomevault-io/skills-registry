# Assess

Step back and critically reassess project state. Provides interactive guidance (human-in-the-loop)
and programmatic analysis (automated pipelines). Specialized for doc pruning and doc-code alignment.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Structured JSON assessment for pipelines
.pi/skills/assess/assess.py run . --output assessment.json

# Generate all figures from assessment
create-figure from-assess --input assessment.json --output-dir ./figures/
```

## Assessment Flow

### 1. Scope the Assessment

**Clear scope** ("assess the auth module") → proceed directly.
**Open scope** ("step back") → ask: concerns? code quality vs docs? known issues to skip?
**Doc pruning** ("prune documentation") → ask: deprecated features? missing docs? alignment?

### 2. Find Project Root & Detect Ecosystem

Detect via marker files (pyproject.toml, package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod).
Read ecosystem-specific metadata, then universal docs (README.md, CONTEXT.md, AGENTS.md).

### 3. Load Skill Manifest (Route-Gated)

Load `.pi/skills-manifest.json` for assessments that could lead to "we should build X"
recommendations. Skip for status checks and doc-only reviews.

```bash
cat .pi/skills-manifest.json | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f'Skills: {data[\"skill_count\"]} (generated: {data[\"generated\"]})')
"
```

Warn if manifest >7 days stale. Fallback: `ls .pi/skills/ | wc -l`.

### 4. Quick Scan → Check In → Deep Dive

1. Read project metadata, README, glob for structure
2. Note 2-3 initial observations, check in with user
3. Deep dive based on user guidance — for each finding: blocking? known? fix complexity?

### 5. Collaborative Report

Present findings and ask which to fix. Offer `/create-figure` for visualization.

## Assessment Categories

### 1. Doc-Code Alignment
- README claims vs implementation
- Cross-reference validation (internal links, code examples)
- Placeholder markers and stale information
- Deprecation: docs for removed features

### 2. Aspirational vs Implemented
- Stubs (`pass`, `raise NotImplementedError`), placeholder notes
- Features in code structure but no logic, unused dependencies

### 3. Brittle Code
- Hardcoded values, missing error handling, fragile regex/parsing

### 4. Non-Working Code
- Dead code paths, silent exception swallowing, broken integrations

### 5. Over-Engineered Code
- Abstractions with single implementation, config for hypothetical flexibility

### 6. Test Coverage (Non-Negotiable)
Check each feature/module for test files, passing tests, edge cases.
Flag `pytest.mark.skip` without reason, "0 tests collected", tests that don't assert.

**Task file audit:** Verify each task has Definition of Done with specific test/assertion.
Block execution if implementation tasks lack Definition of Done.

### 7. Working Well
Acknowledge solid code to calibrate the assessment.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Assessment: <project-name>

## Summary
<2-3 sentences: overall health, key findings>

## Findings

### Doc-Code Alignment
| Claim | Reality | Action? |

### Issues Found
1. **file.py:123** - [Issue] — Severity: H/M/L — Suggested fix: [brief]

### Test Coverage
| Feature | Test Status | Action Needed |

### Working Well
- [Solid code to acknowledge]

## Recommended Next Steps
1-4 prioritized actions. Ask which to start.
```

## Policies

- **Read-only by default** — never write files without explicit consent
- **Print first, write with consent** — show proposed content, then offer to write
- **Collaborate** — assessment is dialogue, not monologue
- **Ask before running** — get permission before tests, builds, paid services
- **Escalate wisely** — suggest `/review-code` for complex/critical issues
- **Be specific** — file paths and line numbers
- **Be actionable** — each finding suggests next steps
- **Test coverage is non-negotiable** — flag missing tests as blockers

## External Research

Available when needed (ask before paid services):
- `/context7` — library docs (free)
- `/brave-search` — general web (free)
- `/perplexity` — deep research (paid)

## Common Mistakes

```bash
# WRONG: Treat all assessment findings as blocking issues
# → Agent auto-adds docstrings to 12 private helpers. Unnecessary bloat.
# RIGHT: Review findings with user. Escalate complex issues to /review-code.

# WRONG: Skip /assess after major changes
# → README examples use old function signature. Users hit errors.
# RIGHT: Run assess --focus "doc-code-alignment" after editing core APIs

# WRONG: Run /assess and act on stale results
# → Assessment was from 3 days ago. Codebase changed since.
# RIGHT: Always re-run assess; never cache results across sessions
```
