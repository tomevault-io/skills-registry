# Skills Best Practices

Use this skill when creating or reviewing skills under `.pi/skills/`.

## ArangoDB Access Policy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- `/memory` is the ONLY skill that accesses ArangoDB directly
- `/ops-arango` handles admin ops (backups, indexes, migrations)
- `monitor-memory` has read-only exception for health probes (documented)
- ALL other skills MUST use `memory/run.sh` subcommands:
  - `memory recall` — semantic + BM25 search
  - `memory learn` — store lessons/data
  - `memory sample` — random document sampling
  - `memory tag` — post-insert tag stamping
  - `memory count` — collection statistics
  - `memory archive-session` — episodic archival
- NEVER: `from arango import ArangoClient`
- NEVER: `sys.path.insert(0, MEMORY_PATH)`
- NEVER: hardcoded passwords or raw `/_api/cursor` calls

## Storage Policy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The root NVMe is for CODE ONLY.** All heavy artifacts MUST live on the 12TB drive
and be symlinked back. This is enforced by `/skills-broadcast` and `/ops-workstation`.

### What MUST be on `/mnt/storage12tb`

| Category | Examples | Storage Path |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Model weights** | `.safetensors`, `.gguf`, `.bin`, `.pt` | `/mnt/storage12tb/skills/<skill-name>/models/` |
| **Training logs** | RVC logs, checkpoints, tensorboard | `/mnt/storage12tb/skills/<skill-name>/logs/` |
| **Extracted data** | `extracted_runs/`, PDF extractions | `/mnt/storage12tb/skills/<skill-name>/extracted_runs/` |
| **Generated outputs** | batch results, GRPO outputs | `/mnt/storage12tb/skills/<skill-name>/outputs/` |
| **Datasets** | training data, WAV files, corpora | `/mnt/storage12tb/skills/<skill-name>/data/` |
| **Work dirs** | temp processing, intermediate files | `/mnt/storage12tb/skills/<skill-name>/work/` |
| **Backups** | `.backups/`, snapshots | `/mnt/storage12tb/backups/<project>/` |

### What MUST NEVER be synced by `/skills-broadcast`

These directories are **excluded from rsync** and must not exist as real directories
in skill folders (only as symlinks to `/mnt/storage12tb/`):

`.venv`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `models`, `rvc`, `outputs`, `logs`, `data`,
`pods`, `extracted_runs`, `work`, `weights`, `checkpoints`, `artifacts`, `sessions`,
`papers`, `datasets`, `*.safetensors`, `*.gguf`, `*.bin`, `*.pt`

### How to set up a new heavy artifact directory

```bash
# 1. Create the storage location on 12TB drive
mkdir -p /mnt/storage12tb/skills/<skill-name>/models

# 2. Move existing data (if any)
mv /path/to/skill/models/* /mnt/storage12tb/skills/<skill-name>/models/

# 3. Remove the directory and create symlink
rmdir /path/to/skill/models
ln -s /mnt/storage12tb/skills/<skill-name>/models /path/to/skill/models
```

### Enforcement

- `/skills-broadcast sanity` FAILS if any skill has non-symlinked dirs >100MB
- `/ops-workstation slim` reports storage policy violations
- `.gitignore` in every skill should exclude heavy artifact patterns

## Required structure

- A skill is a folder with a required `SKILL.md` at the root.
- `SKILL.md` must start with YAML frontmatter (no code fences).
- Frontmatter delimiters must be standalone lines: opening `---` on line 1 and closing `---` on its own line.
- Frontmatter must include `name` and `description`.
- The `description` should contain explicit trigger contexts (what users will say).
- Keep `SKILL.md` concise; move large content into `references/` or `scripts/`.
- Avoid extra docs (CHANGELOG) inside the skill folder.
- README.md is allowed for skills that declare `provides:` (composable primitives with human developer audiences). SKILL.md is for agents; README.md is for humans browsing the directory.

## Composition Frontmatter (Valence Shell)

Skills are like chemical elements — they bind to each other through defined interfaces.
The `provides:` and `composes:` frontmatter fields declare a skill's **valence shell**:
what it offers to others and what it needs from others.

### Required composition fields

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: >
  What this skill does and trigger phrases.
triggers:
  - natural language phrase users will say
  - another trigger phrase
provides:
  - capability-a       # What this skill outputs/offers
  - capability-b
composes:
  - memory             # Skills this delegates to (by name)
  - scillm
  - extractor
---
```

### Field definitions

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `triggers` | list[str] | **Yes** | Natural-language phrases users will say. Parsed at runtime by `skill-selector` extension for BM25-style matching. Skills without triggers are invisible to implicit routing. |
| `provides` | list[str] | Yes | Capabilities this skill makes available. Used by `/skill-lab` gap detector. |
| `composes` | list[str] | Yes | Skills this skill delegates to via subprocess/import. Empty list `[]` if self-contained. Parsed at runtime by `skill-selector` extension for dependency expansion — when a skill is selected, its `composes` deps are automatically included in context. |
| `taxonomy` | list[str] | Recommended | Federated taxonomy bridge tags for multi-hop discovery via `/memory`. Uses standard vocabulary: `precision`, `resilience`, `fragility`, `corruption`, `loyalty`, `stealth`, plus domain tags. |

### Runtime consumption (skill-selector extension)

The `.pi/extensions/skill-selector.ts` extension reads frontmatter at session start:

- **`triggers`** → Built into an inverted token index. When users type natural language
  (no `/skill-name` ref), the extension scores the prompt against triggers+descriptions
  to select relevant skills. **Skills without triggers are invisible to implicit routing.**
- **`composes`** → Parsed into a dependency map. When a skill is selected (explicitly or
  via trigger match), all its `composes` dependencies are automatically pulled into context.
  This replaced a hardcoded static map (Feb 2026) — the extension now reads live frontmatter.
- **`provides`** → Used by `/skill-lab` for gap detection and capability graph traversal.
  Not yet consumed by skill-selector (future: reverse-index for "I need X capability" queries).

### Binding affinity rules

1. **Skills MUST declare all skills they delegate to** in `composes:`.
2. **Skills MUST declare what they output** in `provides:`.
3. **Self-contained skills** (no external dependencies) use `composes: []`.
4. **Lab skills** (prompt-lab, gpt-lab, classifier-lab) are **catalysts** — they
   create new skills without being consumed. They `provide: [skill-creation]`.
5. **Composite skills** are molecules — stable combinations of existing skills
   wired together by a thin orchestrator.

### Capability vocabulary (standardized provides values)

| Capability | Skills that provide it |
|------------|----------------------|
| `llm-completion` | scillm, codex |
| `embedding` | embedding |
| `memory-recall` | memory |
| `memory-learn` | memory |
| `web-search` | brave-search, dogpile |
| `pdf-extraction` | extractor, review-pdf |
| `security-scan` | hack, security-scan |
| `skill-creation` | prompt-lab, gpt-lab, classifier-lab |
| `skill-validation` | skills-ci, best-practices-skills |
| `competitive-selection` | battle |
| `hardening` | anvil |
| `docker-isolation` | battle, hack |
| `human-interview` | interview |
| `task-planning` | plan |
| `task-orchestration` | orchestrate |
| `taxonomy-tagging` | taxonomy |
| `progress-tracking` | task-monitor |

New capabilities should be added to `references/capability_vocabulary.yml`.

### Graph Registration (Multi-Hop Discovery)

Skills SHOULD be registered in `/memory` as nodes in the knowledge graph.
This enables multi-hop traversal — when `/skill-lab` needs a capability,
it can traverse `composes` edges to find transitive dependencies, just like
`/memory` traverses `relates_to` edges for knowledge discovery.

```
skill:extractor ──composes──► skill:memory
                 ──composes──► skill:scillm
                 ──provides──► capability:pdf-extraction

skill:learn-datalake ──composes──► skill:extractor
                      ──composes──► skill:review-pdf
                      ──composes──► skill:memory
```

This is analogous to chemical bonding — the graph reveals which elements
naturally form molecules. `/taxonomy` tags provide the bridge keywords
that enable cross-domain discovery (a security skill and an extraction skill
might share `taxonomy:validation` tags).

Registration pattern:
```python
from common.memory_client import learn, MemoryScope

# Register skill as a knowledge node
learn(
    problem=f"What does {skill_name} provide?",
    solution=f"Provides: {', '.join(provides)}. Composes: {', '.join(composes)}",
    scope=MemoryScope.OPERATIONAL,
    tags=["skill_registry", skill_name] + provides,
)
```

### Machine-parseable rules

See `references/rules.yml` for the complete machine-parseable rule set
that `/skills-ci` and `/skill-lab` validate against.
See `references/composition_manifest.yml` for the schema `/skill-lab` uses
when planning new composite skills.
Run `./sanity.sh` in this skill to enforce the strict frontmatter gate across all skills.

## Design patterns

1. **Progressive disclosure**
   - Layer 1: Frontmatter (`name`, `description`) for routing.
   - Layer 2: `SKILL.md` body for the workflow map.
   - Layer 3: `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` for details on demand.

2. **Guardrails vs freedom**
   - High-variance tasks: instructions only.
   - Fragile/repetitive tasks: scripts with parameters.
   - Mixed tasks: decision tree in `SKILL.md` + references/scripts.

3. **Single source of truth**
   - Put schemas, long examples, and variants in `references/`.
   - `SKILL.md` should point to references, not duplicate them.

## Checklist (creation/review)

- Frontmatter is valid YAML (no markdown fences).
- Frontmatter has opening and closing `---` on standalone lines.
- `name` matches the directory name.
- `description` contains clear trigger phrases, uses YAML fold syntax (`>`) — **never inline**.
- **`triggers`** list contains natural-language phrases users will say. **Required** — skills without triggers are invisible to implicit routing via skill-selector.
- **`provides`** list declares capabilities this skill outputs. **Required.**
- **`composes`** list declares all skills this delegates to. **Required** (use `[]` if self-contained). Parsed at runtime for automatic dependency inclusion.
- `run.sh` exists only if the skill needs execution.
- `sanity.sh` exists if the skill runs non-trivial scripts.
- **CLI: Typer only** — all Python CLIs use `typer`. NEVER `argparse` or `click`.
- **No bespoke reimplementations** — if a helper skill exists, the new skill delegates to it.
- **PyYAML dependency** — any script that parses SKILL.md frontmatter MUST depend on
  `pyyaml` (not a fallback regex parser). The `>` and `|` YAML block scalars, nested
  objects, and multi-line strings are only reliably parsed by a real YAML parser.


See [PATTERNS.md](references/PATTERNS.md) for anti-patterns, runtime integration patterns, task-monitor, NDJSON streaming, self-correction, quality gates, memory integration, human-in-the-loop, and templates.

## Common Mistakes

### WRONG: Missing triggers in frontmatter (skill is invisible to implicit routing)
```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Does something useful
provides: [my-capability]
composes: [memory]
---
```

### RIGHT: Include natural-language trigger phrases
```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Does something useful
triggers:
  - do the useful thing
  - run my-skill
provides: [my-capability]
composes: [memory]
---
```

### WRONG: Accessing ArangoDB directly from a skill
```python
from arango import ArangoClient
client = ArangoClient(hosts="http://127.0.0.1:8529")
```

### RIGHT: Use /memory subcommands for all data access
```bash
.pi/skills/memory/run.sh recall --q "query" --collections lessons
.pi/skills/memory/run.sh learn --problem "X" --solution "Y"
```

### WRONG: Reimplementing functionality that an existing skill provides
```python
def custom_bm25_search(query, docs):  # /memory already does this
    ...
```

### RIGHT: Delegate to existing skills via composes
```yaml
composes:
  - memory  # use /memory recall for search
```

## Defensive Error Handling (Tiered by Complexity)

**Project agents in 2026 do not thoroughly read SKILL.md files.** Skills that expose HTTP
endpoints or APIs MUST implement server-side misuse detection with helpful error messages.
Documentation alone is insufficient — the API itself must teach correct usage.

### Skill Complexity Tiers

| Tier | Type | Examples | Misuse Handling |
|------|------|----------|-----------------|
| **1** | One-shot script | `/create-icon`, `/png-svg-converter` | None — fail fast, error is obvious |
| **2** | CLI with params | `/extractor`, `/embedding` | Typer handles it; add `--help` examples |
| **3** | Daemon/socket | `/memory`, `/inference` | Basic input validation in handler |
| **4** | HTTP API | `/scillm`, `/fetcher` | **Full misuse detection required** |
| **5** | Multi-agent orchestrator | `/orchestrate`, `/battle` | Full detection + state machine guards |

**Rule: If agents call it programmatically (not via slash command), it needs defensive handling.**

For Tier 4-5 skills, use the reusable template: `references/misuse_guard_template.py`

### Principle: The API is the Documentation

When a caller misuses your API, don't return a generic error. Return an error that:
1. **Explains what went wrong** — specific, not "Bad Request"
2. **Explains why it's a problem** — the consequence of the misuse
3. **Shows how to fix it** — include a code example if possible
4. **References SKILL.md** — for detailed reading (which they won't do, but it's there)

### Required Misuse Detection for HTTP Skills

| Misuse Category | Detection | Response |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| **Missing required params** | Presence check | 400 + list required params + example |
| **Wrong param types** | Type check | 400 + expected type + example |
| **Unknown params** | Schema validation | Warning log (don't reject, be tolerant) |
| **Batch overload** | Queue depth/concurrency | 429 + chunk size recommendation |
| **Timeout-prone input** | Size/complexity check | Warning header or 413 + size limits |
| **Provider mismatch** | Feature/provider compatibility | 400 + correct provider/format hint |
| **Service not running** | (client-side preflight) | Document in SKILL.md troubleshooting |

### Example: scillm Misuse Detection (Reference Implementation)

`/scillm` implements comprehensive misuse detection — use it as a template:

```python
# In your validation middleware or endpoint handler:

def validate_request(body: dict, model: str) -> None:
    """Validate request and return helpful errors."""
    
    # 1. Auto-fix common mistakes (tolerant)
    if isinstance(body.get("messages"), str):
        logger.warning("Auto-wrapping string messages as list")
        body["messages"] = [{"role": "user", "content": body["messages"]}]
    
    # 2. Strip problematic params with warning (tolerant)
    if "max_tokens" in body:
        logger.warning(f"Stripping max_tokens — causes empty output")
        del body["max_tokens"]
    
    # 3. Reject incompatible combinations (strict with guidance)
    if has_inline_data(body) and not model.startswith("gemini"):
        raise HTTPException(
            400,
            f"inlineData only works with Gemini. You used model='{model}'. "
            f"For other providers, use image_url format. See SKILL.md."
        )
    
    # 4. Detect resource exhaustion (early warning)
    queue_depth = get_queue_depth(provider)
    if queue_depth > 100:
        raise HTTPException(
            429,
            f"BATCH MISUSE: {queue_depth} requests queued. "
            f"Use chunked processing: process 4 at a time, wait, repeat. "
            f"Example: for chunk in chunks(items, 4): await gather(*chunk)"
        )
```

### Checklist for HTTP/API Skills

- [ ] **Missing/empty required params** → 400 + param name + expected format
- [ ] **Type mismatches** → Auto-fix if safe, else 400 + correct type
- [ ] **Unknown model/endpoint** → 400 + list valid options
- [ ] **Incompatible feature combinations** → 400 + which combos work
- [ ] **Batch/queue overload** → 429 + chunk size + code example
- [ ] **Timeout-prone requests** → Warning header or log
- [ ] **Repeated bad requests** → Temp block (abuse guard) + explain why
- [ ] **Service not running** → Document preflight check in SKILL.md

### Common Mistakes

### WRONG: Generic error that doesn't help the caller
```python
raise HTTPException(400, "Bad Request")
```

### RIGHT: Error that teaches correct usage
```python
raise HTTPException(
    400,
    f"Unknown model '{model}'. Available: text, vlm, local-text. "
    f"Usage: POST /v1/chat/completions with model='text'. "
    f"This is an HTTP API — call via httpx, not import."
)
```

### WRONG: Silently failing on invalid input
```python
if not valid:
    return None  # Caller has no idea what went wrong
```

### RIGHT: Explicit rejection with guidance
```python
if not valid:
    raise HTTPException(
        400,
        f"Invalid format. Expected: {expected_format}. "
        f"Got: {actual_format}. See SKILL.md examples."
    )
```

### WRONG: Letting batch operations timeout silently
```python
# 400 requests fire at once, most timeout after 5 minutes
results = await gather(*[call(x) for x in all_400_items])
```

### RIGHT: Detect and reject batch abuse early
```python
if queue_depth > THRESHOLD:
    raise HTTPException(429, f"Too many queued ({queue_depth}). Use chunking.")
```

### WRONG: Hardcoding all valid values (unmaintainable)
```python
# BAD: This list becomes stale as collections are added/removed
VALID_COLLECTIONS = {"sparta_qra", "lessons_v2", "personas", "checkpoints", ...}

def validate(collection):
    if collection not in VALID_COLLECTIONS:  # ← False negatives for new collections
        raise HTTPException(400, f"Unknown collection")
```

### RIGHT: Map only misuse patterns → corrections
```python
# GOOD: Only catches specific mistakes agents make, never false negatives
COLLECTION_CORRECTIONS = {
    "sparta_qras": "sparta_qra",     # plural → singular
    "sparta_control": "sparta_controls",  # singular → plural (this one IS plural)
    "lesons": "lessons_v2",           # typo
}

def validate(collection):
    if collection in COLLECTION_CORRECTIONS:
        correct = COLLECTION_CORRECTIONS[collection]
        raise HTTPException(400, f"'{collection}' is wrong. Use '{correct}'.")
    # Unknown collections pass through — actual existence checked by db.has_collection()
```

## Misuse Guard Architecture (Template, Not Shared)

**Do NOT create a shared misuse guard module imported across skills.** Skills should be
self-contained and portable. The correct pattern is **copy and adapt** from the template.

### Why NOT a shared import

| Concern | Problem with shared script |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Coupling** | Skills should be self-contained and portable |
| **Different projects** | Skills may live in separate repos/directories |
| **Import paths** | `sys.path` hacks are fragile across containers/venvs |
| **Skill-specific validators** | Each skill has unique misuse patterns |
| **Versioning** | Change to shared breaks all skills simultaneously |

### Correct pattern: Template + Local Copy

```
~/.pi/skills/best-practices-skills/references/
└── misuse_guard_template.py   ← TEMPLATE (copy and adapt)

Each Tier 4-5 skill that needs it:
├── skill-a/src/.../app/_misuse_guard.py   ← local copy, skill-specific validators
├── skill-b/src/.../proxy/validation.py    ← inline validation (alternative)
└── skill-c/.../_misuse_guard.py           ← local copy, different validators
```

### What the template provides

The template at `references/misuse_guard_template.py` includes:

1. **`MisuseGuard` class** — Copy as-is, configure `skill_name` and thresholds
2. **Common validators** — Pick what applies to your skill:
   - `require_non_empty(field, example)` — Required param validation
   - `auto_wrap_string_as_list(field)` — Tolerant type coercion
   - `reject_incompatible(condition, message)` — Feature combination guards
   - `warn_and_strip(field, reason)` — Strip problematic params
   - `detect_batch_abuse(get_queue_depth, threshold)` — Queue overload detection
   - `correct_value(field, corrections)` — Map misuse patterns → corrections
3. **Abuse detection** — Track repeated bad requests, temp-block abusive clients
4. **Schema validation** — Type checking with helpful error messages
5. **Misuse event logging** — All errors logged to `/memory` for nightly analysis

### Misuse Event Logging (Cross-Skill Learning)

All misuse events are logged to the `misuse_events` collection in `/memory`. The
nightly `/monitor-misuse` job analyzes these events across all skills to:
- Detect new misuse patterns (cluster similar errors)
- Propose corrections (LLM-generated, human-reviewed)
- Track which skills need better docs

**Storage location:** `POST /store` with `collection: "misuse_events"`

**Two implementations depending on context:**

| Context | Implementation | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| **Inside /memory service** | Direct ArangoDB write | No HTTP round-trip, already have db connection |
| **Other skills (template)** | httpx POST `/store` to memory socket | Standard API access |

```python
# Template version (for skills OUTSIDE /memory):
def log_misuse_event(skill, endpoint, error_type, sent_value, correct_value=None):
    import httpx
    transport = httpx.HTTPTransport(uds="/run/user/1000/embry/memory.sock")
    with httpx.Client(transport=transport, base_url="http://localhost", timeout=2.0) as client:
        client.post("/store", json={
            "document": {
                "_key": hashlib.sha256(f"{skill}:{endpoint}:{error_type}:{sent_value}".encode()).hexdigest()[:16],
                "skill": skill,
                "endpoint": endpoint,
                "error_type": error_type,
                "sent_value": sent_value,
                "correct_value": correct_value,
                "was_known": correct_value is not None,
                "ts": int(time.time()),
            },
            "collection": "misuse_events",
        })

# /memory version (direct ArangoDB, avoids HTTP):
def _log_misuse_event(endpoint, error_type, sent_value, correct_value=None):
    from ...arango_client import get_db
    db = get_db()
    coll = db.collection("misuse_events")
    # ... direct insert/update
```

**Event schema:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `_key` | str | Hash of skill:endpoint:error_type:sent_value (dedupes) |
| `skill` | str | Skill name (memory, scillm, fetcher) |
| `endpoint` | str | Endpoint path (/store, /v1/chat/completions) |
| `error_type` | str | Category (wrong_collection, missing_param, batch_abuse) |
| `sent_value` | str | What the caller sent |
| `correct_value` | str? | What they should have sent (None if unknown) |
| `was_known` | bool | True if we had a correction pattern |
| `ts` | int | Unix timestamp |
| `count` | int | Occurrence count (incremented on duplicates) |

### How to use in a new skill

```python
# 1. Copy template to your skill
cp ~/.pi/skills/best-practices-skills/references/misuse_guard_template.py \
   ./src/my_skill/_misuse_guard.py

# 2. Import and configure
from ._misuse_guard import MisuseGuard, require_non_empty, reject_incompatible

guard = MisuseGuard(skill_name="my-skill")

# 3. Add skill-specific validators
guard.add_validator("input", require_non_empty("input", "example text"))
guard.add_validator("no_conflicting_flags", reject_incompatible(
    lambda body: body.get("flag_a") and body.get("flag_b"),
    "flag_a and flag_b are mutually exclusive"
))

# 4. Define skill-specific schema
schema = {
    "input": {"required": True, "type": str, "example": "your input here"},
    "format": {"required": False, "type": str, "example": "json"},
}

# 5. Use in endpoint
@app.post("/v1/my-endpoint")
async def endpoint(body: dict):
    body = guard.validate(body, schema=schema)
    # ... rest of handler
```

### When to update the template

When you discover a new misuse pattern in any skill:

1. **Fix it locally** in that skill's `_misuse_guard.py`
2. **Generalize** the validator (make it reusable)
3. **Add to template** in `best-practices-skills/references/misuse_guard_template.py`
4. **Document** the pattern in this SKILL.md

This is the **copy-up pattern** — local innovation, then standardize for future skills.

### Automatic Pattern Discovery via /monitor-misuse

Misuse events are logged to the `misuse_events` collection. The `/monitor-misuse`
skill runs nightly to:

1. **Cluster unknown errors** — group similar misuses across all skills
2. **Propose corrections** — LLM generates fix suggestions
3. **Apply to skill files** — approved corrections update the skill's `_misuse_guard.py`

```
All skills with misuse guards
         │
         │ log_misuse_event()
         ▼
  misuse_events collection
         │
         │ nightly /monitor-misuse analyze
         ▼
  misuse_corrections collection
         │
         │ human review + /monitor-misuse apply
         ▼
  skill/_misuse_guard.py updated
```

**To enable auto-apply for your skill**, register it in `/monitor-misuse/scripts/skill_registry.py`:

```python
SKILL_GUARDS = {
    "memory": SkillMisuseGuard(
        skill_name="memory",
        guard_path=Path("/path/to/skill/_misuse_guard.py"),
        corrections_var="COLLECTION_CORRECTIONS",  # or MODEL_CORRECTIONS, etc.
    ),
}
```

This closes the loop: agents make mistakes → events logged → patterns detected →
corrections proposed → guards updated → future agents get helpful errors.

### Common Mistakes

### WRONG: Sharing a single misuse guard across skills via import
```python
# DON'T DO THIS
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/home/user/.pi/skills/shared-utils/")
from shared_misuse_guard import MisuseGuard  # Fragile, not portable
```

### RIGHT: Copy template and adapt locally
```python
# Each skill has its own copy with skill-specific validators
from ._misuse_guard import MisuseGuard, require_non_empty
guard = MisuseGuard(skill_name="this-skill")
```

### WRONG: Creating a pip package just for misuse guard
```python
# Overkill for the current skill ecosystem
from pi_skill_utils import MisuseGuard  # Adds dependency management overhead
```

### RIGHT: Simple template copy (no dependencies)
```bash
# Template is self-contained, just copy it
cp ~/.pi/skills/best-practices-skills/references/misuse_guard_template.py \
   ./my_skill/_misuse_guard.py
```

## Service Usage Audits (Tier 4-5 Infrastructure Skills)

Infrastructure skills that other projects call programmatically (scillm, memory, fetcher, etc.)
SHOULD provide an **`assess` capability** that audits external code for correct usage.

### Why This Matters

1. **Agents don't read SKILL.md** — they skim or skip to code examples
2. **Misuse patterns repeat** — same mistakes across many projects
3. **The service agent is the expert** — knows what breaks and why
4. **Catch errors before runtime** — don't wait for 5-minute timeout

### The Pattern

Each infrastructure skill documents:
- **API contracts** — correct usage patterns
- **Known misuse patterns** — what breaks and why (see Common Mistakes sections)
- **Machine-readable rules** — for automated checking

Then exposes an `assess` command that checks external code against these patterns.

### Implementation: `./run.sh assess <file>`

```bash
# scillm assess — checks LLM API usage
./run.sh assess /path/to/script.py
# Output:
# ✅ HTTP API (not import)
# ✅ Model aliases used (text, vlm)
# ✅ No max_tokens
# ✅ Chunked batching (CHUNK_SIZE=4)
# ⚠️ Missing response_format on JSON call (line 89)
# ⚠️ No preflight check before batch

# memory assess — checks memory API usage
./run.sh assess /path/to/script.py
# Output:
# ✅ Uses Unix socket transport
# ✅ Reads data["items"] (not "results")
# ⚠️ subprocess.run in loop (line 78) — use httpx client
# ⚠️ /store without tags (line 134) — multi-hop won't find it
```

### What to Check (by service)

| Service | Misuse Patterns to Detect |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **scillm** | Import instead of HTTP; fire-all-at-once batching; max_tokens; missing response_format; no preflight |
| **memory** | `data["results"]` instead of `items`; TCP instead of Unix socket; subprocess loops; raw AQL; /learn (deprecated) |
| **fetcher** | Missing timeout; no retry logic; blocking calls in async context |
| **embedding** | Wrong dimension (384 required); batch size too large; missing normalization |

### Checklist for Infrastructure Skills

- [ ] **Document misuse patterns** in Common Mistakes section of SKILL.md
- [ ] **Create `assess` subcommand** in run.sh that greps/parses external code
- [ ] **Return structured output** — JSON with file, line, pattern, severity, fix suggestion
- [ ] **Register with /monitor-misuse** for cross-skill pattern aggregation
- [ ] **Add to CI** — assess changed files that use your service

### Example: Minimal assess implementation

```python
# In run.sh, add: assess) python3 scripts/assess_usage.py "$2" ;;

# scripts/assess_usage.py
import re
import sys
import json
from pathlib import Path

PATTERNS = [
    {
        "name": "fire_all_at_once",
        "pattern": r"asyncio\.gather\(\*\[.*for.*in.*all_",
        "severity": "error",
        "message": "Fires all requests at once — use CHUNK_SIZE batching",
        "fix": "for i in range(0, len(items), CHUNK_SIZE): await gather(*chunk)"
    },
    {
        "name": "missing_response_format",
        "pattern": r'"model":\s*\w+.*"messages".*(?!"response_format")',
        "severity": "warning",
        "message": "JSON expected but response_format not set",
        "fix": 'Add "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}'
    },
]

def assess(file_path: str) -> list[dict]:
    content = Path(file_path).read_text()
    issues = []
    for p in PATTERNS:
        for m in re.finditer(p["pattern"], content, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL):
            line = content[:m.start()].count("\n") + 1
            issues.append({
                "file": file_path,
                "line": line,
                "pattern": p["name"],
                "severity": p["severity"],
                "message": p["message"],
                "fix": p["fix"],
            })
    return issues

if __name__ == "__main__":
    issues = assess(sys.argv[1])
    print(json.dumps({"issues": issues, "passed": len(issues) == 0}, indent=2))
```

### Cross-Project Usage

```bash
# CI workflow: assess all files that changed and use scillm
git diff --name-only main | xargs grep -l "localhost:4001\|SCILLM" | while read f; do
    ~/.pi/skills/scillm/run.sh assess "$f"
done

# Agent self-check before running batch
if ! ~/.pi/skills/scillm/run.sh assess scripts/generate_qras.py | jq -e '.passed'; then
    echo "Fix usage issues before running batch"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Reference Implementations
