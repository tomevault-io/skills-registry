# Cleanup Skill

This skill performs a deep assessment of the codebase to identify technical debt, unused files, and outdated documentation, then performs cleanup operations with confirmation.

## Key Features

- **Artifact archival**: Detects binary/media files (`.wav`, `.mp4`, `.pt`, `.ckpt`, `.parquet`, etc.) and moves them to `/mnt/storage12tb/artifacts/<project>/<date>/` instead of deleting
- **Root stray detection**: Flags untracked directories at project root that don't belong (e.g. `personaplex/`, `data_horus/`)
- **Junk file cleanup**: Removes logs, temp files, cache dirs
- **Dead file detection**: Finds tracked files with no references in codebase
- **Doc staleness**: Flags docs with TODO/FIXME or >365 days without changes

## Workflow

1. **Assessment** (`--dry-run`): Scan the codebase for:
   - Root-level artifacts and stray directories → archive to 12TB
   - Untracked "junk" files (logs, temp images, build artifacts) → delete
   - Tracked files that are no longer referenced in the codebase
   - Outdated documentation files
2. **Planning** (`--plan`): Generate a **Cleanup Plan** markdown file for review.
3. **Execution** (`--execute`): Perform cleanup operations with user confirmation:
   - Archive artifacts to 12TB drive (with optional `--force` to skip prompts)
   - Remove junk files (with optional `--force` to skip prompts)
   - Remove dead tracked files (always requires confirmation, never auto-deleted)
   - Log all actions to `local/CLEANUP_LOG.md`

## How to Use

1. Trigger with "cleanup this project" or "archive artifacts".
2. Run `bash .pi/skills/cleanup/run.sh --dry-run` to see JSON findings.
3. Run `bash .pi/skills/cleanup/run.sh --plan` to generate a readable cleanup plan.
4. Review the plan and run `bash .pi/skills/cleanup/run.sh --execute` to perform cleanup.
5. Use `--force` to skip confirmation for junk files and archives (dead files still require confirmation).

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CLEANUP_ARCHIVE_ROOT` | `/mnt/storage12tb/artifacts` | Where to archive large artifacts |

## Safety Features

- **Dead files always require confirmation**: The skill will never auto-delete tracked files that appear unreferenced. You must explicitly confirm each deletion.
- **Artifacts are archived, not deleted**: Binary/media files are moved to the 12TB drive, not destroyed.
- **Uncommitted changes warning**: The skill warns and asks for confirmation if you have uncommitted changes.
- **Detailed logging**: All actions are recorded in `local/CLEANUP_LOG.md`.

## Command Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Print JSON findings without making changes |
| `--plan` | Generate a Cleanup Plan markdown file |
| `--execute` | Perform cleanup operations with confirmation |
| `--force` | Skip confirmation for junk/archive (dead files still require confirmation) |
| `--output <file>` | Specify output file for plan (default: CLEANUP_PLAN.md) |
| `--archive-root <path>` | Override archive destination path |
