## Philosophy: Human-in-the-Loop

This skill does NOT automate away the researcher. Instead, it:

- **Asks clarifying questions** until ambiguity is resolved
- **Validates assumptions** before proceeding to next stage
- **Presents recommendations** for human approval/override
- **Iterates on feedback** rather than generating final output

Think of it as a research assistant that does the legwork but defers judgment to you.

## ⚡ Quick Start for Agents

**Don't get overwhelmed by 17+ commands!** Use domain navigation:

```bash
# List command domains by workflow stage
create-paper domains

# Filter commands by domain
create-paper list --domain generate    # Paper generation commands
create-paper list --domain verify      # Quality assurance commands
create-paper list --domain comply      # Venue compliance commands

# Get workflow recommendations based on paper stage
create-paper workflow --stage new_paper
create-paper workflow --stage pre_submission

# Show fixture-graph presets for figures
create-paper figure-presets
```

### Domain Quick Reference

| Domain | Commands | When to Use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `generate` | draft, mimic, refine, horus-paper | Starting new paper or revising |
| `verify` | verify, quality, critique, check-citations, weakness-analysis, pre-submit, sanitize | Before submission |
| `comply` | disclosure, ai-ledger, claim-graph | Meeting venue requirements |
| `resources` | phrases, templates | Looking up helpers |

### Agent JSON Output

All navigation commands support `--summary` for JSON output:

```bash
create-paper domains --summary          # JSON of all domains
create-paper workflow --stage new_paper --summary  # JSON recommendations
create-paper figure-presets --summary   # JSON of IEEE sizes + colormaps
```

## Workflow: 5 Stages with Interview Gates

```
1. SCOPE INTERVIEW    → Define paper type, audience, contribution claims
                         [GATE: User validates scope]

2. PROJECT ANALYSIS   → /assess + /dogpile + /review-code
                         [GATE: User confirms analysis accuracy]

3. LITERATURE SEARCH  → /arxiv search + triage
                         [GATE: User selects relevant papers]

4. KNOWLEDGE LEARNING → /arxiv learn on selected papers
                         [GATE: User reviews extracted knowledge]

5. DRAFT GENERATION   → LaTeX from analysis + learned knowledge
                         [GATE: User iterates on structure/content]
```

**Key principle**: Each `[GATE]` blocks until human approval. No stage proceeds with unresolved questions.

---

## Command: `draft`

```bash
./run.sh draft --project /path/to/project
```

Launches interactive paper drafting session.

### Interview Questions (Stage 1: Scope)

The skill asks:

**1. Paper Type**

```
What type of paper are you writing?
a) Research paper (novel contribution)
b) System paper (implementation/architecture)
c) Survey paper (literature review)
d) Experience report (lessons learned)
e) Demo paper (tool description)
```

**2. Target Venue**

```
Target venue/conference? (affects formatting and emphasis)
Examples: ICSE, FSE, ASE, PLDI, arXiv preprint
```

**3. Contribution Claims**

```
What are your 3-5 main contribution claims?
(e.g., "A novel agent memory architecture that...")
```

**4. Target Audience**

```
Who is the intended audience?
a) Software engineering researchers
b) AI/ML practitioners
c) Industry developers
d) Specific domain (e.g., formal methods)
```

**5. Prior Work Scope**

```
Should I search for related work in:
[x] Agent architectures
[ ] Memory systems
[ ] Tool use / function calling
[ ] Other (specify): ___________
```

**GATE**: User reviews and confirms scope. Proceeds only on explicit approval.
