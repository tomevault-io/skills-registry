## Integration with /dogpile

This skill can be invoked via `/dogpile movies`:

```bash
# Via dogpile
/dogpile movies "dark psychological thrillers similar to Blade Runner"

# Equivalent to
./run.sh similar "Blade Runner"
./run.sh bridge Corruption
```

## Taxonomy Integration

All JSON output includes taxonomy metadata for cross-collection graph traversal:

```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "taxonomy": {
    "bridge_tags": ["Corruption", "Stealth"],
    "collection_tags": {
      "domain": "Chaos",
      "function": "Revelation"
    },
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "worth_remembering": true
  }
}
```

This enables queries like:
- "Find movies with same bridge as Siege of Terra lore"
- "Movies matching Resilience theme"

## Configuration

Environment variables:

```bash
TMDB_API_KEY=xxx    # Required: TMDB API key
```

## Rate Limits

| Service | Limit | Implementation |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| TMDB | ~40 req/10s | 0.25s minimum interval |

## Example Horus Queries

```bash
# "What's similar to There Will Be Blood?"
./run.sh similar "There Will Be Blood" --limit 10

# "Find noir films"
./run.sh search-genre "noir"

# "Movies for a corruption scene" (Corruption bridge)
./run.sh bridge Corruption

# "Dark psychological thrillers"
./run.sh bridge Stealth

# "What's trending this week?"
./run.sh trending --range week

# "New releases for discovery"
./run.sh fresh --json
```

## Output Formats

All commands support `--json` for agent-parseable output with taxonomy:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {"id": 345, "title": "No Country for Old Men", "year": "2007", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"]},
    {"id": 678, "title": "Sicario", "year": "2015", "genres": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama"]}
  ],
  "count": 2,
  "taxonomy": {
    "bridge_tags": ["Corruption", "Stealth"],
    "collection_tags": {"domain": "Chaos", "function": "Revelation"},
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "worth_remembering": true
  }
}
```
