# pdf-lab

`/pdf-lab` is a convergence loop that diagnoses PDF extraction failures,
reproduces them on synthetic PDFs, discovers optimal parameters, and
**writes those fixes back to the extractor pipeline code** permanently.

## Why This Exists

There is no absolute ground truth for real PDFs. The system works with
**deltas** between S00's estimate and actual extraction results. When S00
predicts 40 sections but extraction finds 15, something is wrong. `/pdf-lab`
figures out what, fixes it, and makes the fix permanent.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/pi-mono/.pi/skills/pdf-lab

# Main: diagnose, reproduce, converge, and write fix back
./run.sh tune /path/to/real.pdf \
  --review-json /path/to/review_result.json \
  --debug-json /path/to/debug_patterns.json \
  --converge --write-back --json

# Dry run: find the fix but don't write it
./run.sh tune /path/to/real.pdf \
  --review-json ... --debug-json ... \
  --converge --dry-run --json

# Quick diagnosis only (compute delta, no tuning)
./run.sh diagnose /path/to/real.pdf \
  --profile-json /path/to/profile.json \
  --structural-json /path/to/structural.json

# Generate synthetic reproduction PDF only
./run.sh synthetic \
  --patterns '["multi_column","split_tables"]' \
  --output /tmp/repro.pdf

# Show recent tuning results
./run.sh status

# List all pdf-lab code changes
./run.sh history

# Rollback a specific fix
./run.sh rollback --sha abc123
```

## How Fixes Get Written Back

The pipeline has a tiered configuration system. `/pdf-lab` writes to the
appropriate tier:

| Tier | Target | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Env var defaults in step files | `CAMELOT_LINE_SCALE_DEFAULT` 15 -> 40 |
| 2 | Heuristic thresholds (code constants) | `LARGE_FONT_THRESHOLD` 11.0 -> 9.5 |
| 3 | Pattern rules (regex, filters) | New citation pattern in S04 |
| 4 | Preset YAML | `line_scale: 80` in arxiv twin_config.yml |
| 5 | Calibration records (ArangoDB) | Learned pattern in `learned_patterns` |
| 6 | /memory (runtime recall) | Winning params stored for instant recall |

## Persona Attribution

Every code change is traceable to the persona who flagged the issue via
git commit trailers (`Reviewed-By`, `Persona-Role`, `Issue-Codes`).

## Integration

Called by `inline_review_loop.py` when a persona review score is below
threshold. Falls back to heuristic adaptive params if convergence fails.

## Memory + Taxonomy Integration

The skill integrates with the shared memory and taxonomy systems via
`memory_integration.py` for cross-session learning:

- **Pre-hook (`recall_prior_convergence`)**: Before tuning, recalls prior convergence
  results for the same PDF type or URL. Enables the tuner to skip failed strategies
  and start from previously winning parameters.
- **Post-hook (`learn_convergence`)**: After tuning completes, stores the convergence
  outcome (strategy, iterations, final score, improvements, write-back results) to
  memory with taxonomy bridge tags for cross-skill recall.
- **Bridge keywords**: Precision, Resilience, Fragility, Corruption, Loyalty, Stealth
  (tuned to PDF extraction domain).
- **Tags**: `["pdf_lab", "convergence"] + bridges`

Gracefully degrades if `common.memory_client` or `taxonomy/taxonomy.py` are unavailable.
