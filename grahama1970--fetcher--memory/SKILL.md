# Memory Skill - MEMORY FIRST Pattern

**Non-negotiable rule**: Query memory BEFORE scanning any codebase.

## Two Commands (All You Need)

| Command                                  | When                             | Priority      |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `recall --q "..."`                       | FIRST - Before any codebase scan | **MANDATORY** |
| `learn --problem "..." --solution "..."` | After solving new problem        | Required      |

---

## The Memory First Contract

```
BEFORE any file reading, grep, or codebase exploration:
1. Call recall with the problem description
2. If found=true  → Apply existing solution, DO NOT scan codebase
3. If found=false → Proceed with codebase scan, then call learn
```

This is THE pattern. No exceptions.

---

## Quick Start (Self-Contained)

The skill auto-installs via `uv run` from git. No pre-installation needed.

### Optional: Keep recall hot

```
# Terminal 1 — start resident FastAPI server (warm embeddings + FAISS index)
.agents/skills/memory/run.sh serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8601

# Terminal 2 — point CLI/agents at it for sub-second recall
export MEMORY_SERVICE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8601"
```

### Step 1: Recall FIRST

```bash
# ALWAYS start here - check if problem was solved before
.agents/skills/memory/run.sh recall --q "error description"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "found": true,
  "should_scan": false,
  "confidence": 0.72,
  "items": [
    {
      "problem": "AQL bind variable error with collection names",
      "solution": "Use Python f-strings for collection names, not @var"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Decision:**

- `found: true` → Use the solution. DO NOT scan codebase.
- `found: false` → Proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Scan Codebase (ONLY if found=false)

Only after `recall` returns `should_scan: true` may you:

- Read files
- Search with grep/rg
- Explore the codebase

### Step 3: Learn (After Solving)

```bash
# After solving a new problem, capture it for future agents
.agents/skills/memory/run.sh learn \
  --problem "ImportError when running scripts outside venv" \
  --solution "Activate venv first: source .venv/bin/activate"
```

---

## Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Encounter problem: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'graph_memory'"

# 2. RECALL FIRST (mandatory)
.agents/skills/memory/run.sh recall --q "ModuleNotFoundError import"

# If found=true:
#   Apply the solution and STOP
#   DO NOT scan codebase - you already have the answer

# If found=false:
#   3. Now scan codebase, investigate, solve the problem
#   ... (your investigation here) ...
#
#   4. After solving, LEARN for future agents
.agents/skills/memory/run.sh learn \
  --problem "ModuleNotFoundError when running scripts outside venv" \
  --solution "Always activate venv first: source .venv/bin/activate"
```

---

## Why Memory First?

1. **Avoid re-solving problems** - Save hours by checking first
2. **Build knowledge graph** - Each learn() strengthens future queries
3. **Enable multi-hop discovery** - Related problems surface via graph edges
4. **Cross-project learning** - Solutions apply across similar projects

---

## Python API (for integration)

```python
from graph_memory.api import MemoryClient

client = MemoryClient(scope="myproject")

# ALWAYS START HERE
result = client.recall("ImportError when running tests")

if result["found"]:
    # Apply existing solution - DO NOT scan codebase
    print(result["items"][0]["solution"])
else:
    # No prior knowledge - proceed with codebase scan
    # After solving, capture:
    client.learn(
        problem="ImportError when running tests outside venv",
        solution="Activate venv first: source .venv/bin/activate"
    )
```

---

## Environment Setup

```bash
# Required for ArangoDB connection
ARANGO_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8529
ARANGO_DB=lessons
ARANGO_USER=root
ARANGO_PASS=your_password

# Optional for LLM edge verification
CHUTES_API_BASE=...
CHUTES_API_KEY=...
```

---

## Enforcement

Other agents importing this skill MUST follow the Memory First pattern.
The `recall()` method returns `memory_first: true` in metadata to confirm
the correct entry point was used.

Agents that skip `recall` and go directly to codebase scanning are
violating the contract.

---

## Archiver & Analyst Role (Switchboard Integration)

This agent acts as the **Gatekeeper of Knowledge**. Before storing anything, you must ANALYZE it.

**Trigger**: Incoming Switchboard message with `type: "archive"` or `type: "store"`.

**Process**:

1. **Analyze Outcome**: Read the conversation/summary. Determine status:

   - **SUCCESS**: The solution worked and was verified.
   - **FAILURE**: The solution failed or caused new errors.
   - **ABANDONED**: The task was stopped before completion.

2. **Action based on Status**:

   - **IF SUCCESS**:
     - Extract `problem` and `final_solution`.
     - Call: `./run.sh learn --problem "..." --solution "..."`
   - **IF FAILURE**:
     - Extract `problem` and `root_cause`.
     - Call: `./run.sh learn --problem "..." --solution "avoid: [root_cause]"` (Store as a warning)
   - **IF ABANDONED**:
     - do NOT call learn (prevent noise).

3. **Confirm**: Emit a `completed` message with the analysis result.

**Example**:

- Input: "Task failed. Tried X, Y, Z. All timed out."
- Analysis: FAILURE. Root Cause: "Timeout during X".
- Action: Store "Anti-Pattern: Timeout during X".
