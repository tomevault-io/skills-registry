# Skills Optimizer

Audit skills for token efficiency and progressive disclosure compliance.

## What This Skill Does

| Operation | Script | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Analyze Skill | `analyze-skill.sh` | Audit single skill's token footprint |
| Audit All | `audit-all-skills.sh` | Batch audit entire skills directory |
| Validate | `validate-skill.sh` | Check structure and compliance |

---

## Quick Start

### Audit a Single Skill

```bash
./scripts/analyze-skill.sh ~/.claude/skills/my-skill
# Output: Token count, violations, recommendations
```

### Audit All Skills

```bash
./scripts/audit-all-skills.sh ~/.claude/skills
# Generates: audit-report.json with per-skill scores
```

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] **L1**: Description < 1024 chars, includes triggers
- [ ] **L2**: SKILL.md < 500 lines, navigation guide
- [ ] **L3+**: Details in separate files
- [ ] **No deep nesting**: One level from SKILL.md
- [ ] **No voodoo constants**: No explaining what Claude knows

## The 3-Level Disclosure Model

| Level | Target | Loaded When | Contains |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------|
| L1: Metadata | ~200 chars | Startup (all skills) | name, description, triggers |
| L2: SKILL.md | <500 lines | Skill triggered | Quick start, workflow overview |
| L3: Nested docs | Variable | Explicitly accessed | API refs, examples, guides |

---

## Optimization Workflow

1. **Measure**: `wc -w SKILL.md` (target: <2000 words)
2. **Identify violations** (see table below)
3. **Apply fixes**
4. **Validate**: `./scripts/validate-skill.sh`

### Common Violations

| Violation | Detection | Fix |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Bloated description | >1024 chars | Trim, front-load keywords |
| Voodoo constants | Explains PDF/JSON/API | Delete (Claude knows) |
| Inline code dumps | >50 line blocks | Move to `scripts/` |
| Deep nesting | A→B→C chains | Flatten to one level |

## Router Skill Checks (R001-R005)

| R002 | Risk Legend present | Warning |
| R003 | Negative Triggers documented | Warning |
| R004 | Disambiguation examples | Warning |
| R005 | Context awareness (pronoun resolution) | Info |

## Risk Level Checks (K001-K003)

Applied to skills with `scripts/` directory:

| Check | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| K001 | Destructive scripts have ⚠️ indicators | Warning |
| K002 | Bulk operations marked as ⚠️⚠️ | Warning |
| K003 | High-risk ops document --dry-run | Warning |

### Risk Level Reference

| Risk | Symbol | Operations | Required Safeguards |
|------|:------:|------------|---------------------|
| Safe | `-` | search, list, get, export | None |
| Destructive | `⚠️` | create, update, delete | Confirm |
| High-risk | `⚠️⚠️` | bulk ops, admin changes | Confirm + dry-run |

## Audit Report Format

```json
{
  "skill": "my-skill",
  "tokenFootprint": { "level1": 180, "level2": 3200, "level3": 15000 },
  "violations": [...],
  "score": 72,
