# workgraph

## First: orient and start the service

At the start of every session, run these two commands:

```bash
wg quickstart              # Orient yourself — prints cheat sheet and service status
wg service start           # Start the coordinator (no-op if already running)
```

If the service is already running, `wg service start` will tell you. Always ensure the service is up before defining work — it's what dispatches tasks to agents.

## Your role as a top-level agent

You are a **coordinator**. Your job is to define work and let the service dispatch it.

### Start the service if it's not running

```bash
wg service start --max-agents 5
```

### Define tasks with dependencies

```bash
wg add "Design the API" --description "Description of what to do"
wg add "Implement backend" --after design-the-api
wg add "Write tests" --after implement-backend
```

### Monitor progress

```bash
wg list                  # All tasks with status
wg list --status open    # Filter by status (open, in-progress, done, failed)
wg agents                # Who's working on what
wg agents --alive        # Only alive agents
wg agents --working      # Only working agents
wg service status        # Service health
wg status                # Quick one-screen overview
wg watch                 # Stream events as JSON lines (live tail)
wg viz                   # ASCII dependency graph
wg tui                   # Interactive TUI dashboard
wg chat "How is task X?" # Ask the coordinator a question
wg chat -i               # Interactive chat with the coordinator
wg chat --history        # Review past coordinator conversations
```

### What you do NOT do as coordinator

- **Don't `wg claim`** — the service claims tasks automatically
- **Don't `wg spawn`** — the service spawns agents automatically
- **Don't work on tasks yourself** — spawned agents do the work

Always use `wg done` to complete tasks. Tasks with `--verify` enter a `pending-validation` state and need `wg approve` or `wg reject` to finalize.

### Reviewing completed work

Tasks created with `--verify` land in `pending-validation` when agents mark them done. As coordinator, review and finalize:

```bash
wg list --status pending-validation   # See tasks awaiting review
wg show <task-id>                     # Inspect work and artifacts
wg approve <task-id>                  # Accept — transitions to done
wg reject <task-id> --reason "why"    # Reject — reopens for retry (or fails after max rejections)
```

## If you ARE a spawned agent working on a task

You were spawned by the service to work on a specific task. Your workflow:

```bash
wg show <task-id>        # Understand what to do
wg context <task-id>     # See inputs from dependencies
wg log <task-id> "msg"   # Log progress as you work
wg done <task-id>        # Mark complete when finished
```

### Checking and sending messages

Other agents or the coordinator may send you messages with updated requirements or feedback. Check for messages periodically and always reply:

```bash
wg msg read <task-id> --agent $WG_AGENT_ID   # Read unread messages (marks as read)
wg msg send <task-id> "Acknowledged — working on it"  # Reply to messages
wg msg poll <task-id> --agent $WG_AGENT_ID   # Poll without blocking (exit 0 = new, 1 = none)
```

If you discover new work while working:

```bash
wg add "New task" --after <current-task>
```

## Task decomposition

When working on a task, you may discover that it's larger than expected or has independent parts. Rather than doing everything in one shot, decompose into subtasks and let the coordinator dispatch them.

### When to decompose

- **3+ independent parts** that touch disjoint files — parallelize with a diamond
- **Discovered bugs or issues** unrelated to the current task — spin off a fix task
- **Missing prerequisites** — create a blocking task for the prerequisite

### When NOT to decompose

- **Small tasks** — if the total work is under ~200 lines of changes, just do it
- **Shared files** — if the subtasks would all edit the same files, keep them sequential or do them yourself. Parallel agents editing the same file will overwrite each other
- **High coordination overhead** — if explaining the decomposition is harder than doing the work, just do the work

### Diamond pattern for parallel decomposition

Fan out independent work, then join with an integrator:

```bash
# Fan out: each subtask depends on the current task
wg add "Implement module A" --after <current-task> -d "File scope: src/a.rs"
wg add "Implement module B" --after <current-task> -d "File scope: src/b.rs"
wg add "Implement module C" --after <current-task> -d "File scope: src/c.rs"

# Always add an integrator at the join point
wg add "Integrate modules A, B, C" --after implement-module-a,implement-module-b,implement-module-c
```

**Always include an integrator task at join points.** Without one, parallel outputs never get merged and downstream tasks see inconsistent state.

### Guardrails

Two guardrails prevent runaway decomposition:

- **`max_child_tasks_per_agent`** (default: 10) — max tasks a single agent can create via `wg add`. If you hit this limit, the system tells you. Use `wg fail` or `wg log` to explain why more decomposition is needed.
- **`max_task_depth`** (default: 8) — max depth of `--after` chains from root tasks. Prevents infinite decomposition chains. If you hit this, create tasks at the current level instead of nesting deeper.

Configure with:
```bash
wg config --max-child-tasks 15
wg config --max-task-depth 10
```

Record output files so downstream tasks can find them:

```bash
wg artifact <task-id> path/to/output
```

## Manual mode (no service running)

Only use this if you're working alone without the service:

```bash
wg ready                 # See available tasks
wg claim <task-id>       # Claim a task
wg log <task-id> "msg"   # Log progress
wg done <task-id>        # Mark complete
```

## Task lifecycle

```
open → [claim] → in-progress → [done] → done
                              → [done --verify] → pending-validation → [approve] → done
                                                                     → [reject] → open (retry)
                              → [fail] → failed → [retry] → open
                              → [abandon] → abandoned
                              → [wait] → waiting → [condition met] → in-progress
```

**Note:** The `wg approve` and `wg reject` commands handle tasks in `pending-validation` state (tasks created with `--verify`).

## Cycles (repeating workflows)

Some workflows repeat. Workgraph models these as **structural cycles** — `after` back-edges with a `CycleConfig` that controls iteration limits. When a cycle iteration completes, the cycle header task is reset to `open` with its `loop_iteration` incremented, and intermediate tasks are re-opened automatically.

```bash
# Create a write/review cycle, max 3 iterations
wg add "Write" --id write --after review --max-iterations 3
wg add "Review" --after write --id review

# Inspect cycles
wg cycles
```

As a spawned agent on a task inside a cycle, check `wg show <task-id>` for `loop_iteration` to know which pass you're on. Review previous logs and artifacts to build on prior work. If the work has converged and no more iterations are needed, use `wg done <task-id> --converged` to signal early termination — the cycle will not iterate again.

```bash
wg cycles                   # List detected cycles and status
wg show <task-id>           # See loop_iteration and cycle membership
```

### Cycle configuration flags

Fine-tune cycle behavior when creating or editing tasks:

```bash
wg add "Task" --after dep --max-iterations 5 \
  --cycle-guard "task:check=done"    # Guard: only iterate when check is done
  --cycle-delay 5m                   # Wait 5 minutes between iterations
  --no-converge                      # Force all iterations (agents can't signal --converged)
  --no-restart-on-failure            # Don't auto-restart the cycle on failure
  --max-failure-restarts 2           # Cap failure-triggered restarts (default: 3)
```

### Pausing and resuming cycles

To temporarily stop a cycling task without losing its iteration count:

```bash
wg pause <task-id>          # Coordinator skips this task until resumed
wg resume <task-id>         # Task becomes dispatchable again
```

Paused tasks keep their status and iteration count intact. `wg show` displays "(PAUSED)" and `wg list` shows "[PAUSED]".

To pause/resume the entire coordinator (all dispatching stops, running agents continue):

```bash
wg service pause            # No new agents spawned
wg service resume           # Resume dispatching
```

### Output options

All commands support `--json` for structured output. Run `wg --help` for the quick list or `wg --help-all` for every command.

## Executor and model awareness

### Environment variables

Every spawned agent receives these environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `WG_TASK_ID` | The task ID you're working on |
| `WG_AGENT_ID` | Your agent ID |
| `WG_EXECUTOR_TYPE` | Executor type: `claude`, `amplifier`, or `shell` |
| `WG_MODEL` | Model you're running on (e.g. `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) — set when a model is configured |
| `WG_USER` | The current user identity |
| `WG_ENDPOINT` / `WG_ENDPOINT_NAME` | The endpoint name (set when an endpoint is configured) |
| `WG_LLM_PROVIDER` | The LLM provider (e.g. `anthropic`, `openrouter`) |
| `WG_ENDPOINT_URL` | The endpoint URL (set when an endpoint is configured) |
| `WG_API_KEY` | The API key for the endpoint (set when an endpoint is configured) |
| `WG_WORKTREE_PATH` | Path to the agent's isolated git worktree (set when worktree isolation is active) |
| `WG_BRANCH` | The worktree branch name (set when worktree isolation is active) |
| `WG_PROJECT_ROOT` | Path to the main project root (set when worktree isolation is active) |

### Multi-executor awareness

You may be running under different executors:

- **claude** — Claude Code CLI (`claude --print`). You have full access to Claude Code tools (file editing, bash, etc).
- **amplifier** — Amplifier multi-agent runtime. You have access to installed amplifier bundles and can delegate to sub-agents.
- **shell** — Direct shell execution for scripted tasks.

Check `$WG_EXECUTOR_TYPE` to know which executor you're running under if your behavior should differ.

### Model awareness

The `$WG_MODEL` variable tells you what model you're running on. Different tasks may use different models based on complexity (model hierarchy: task.model > executor.model > coordinator.model).

Calibrate your approach to your model tier:
- **Frontier models** (opus): Tackle complex multi-file refactors, architectural decisions, nuanced trade-offs.
- **Mid-tier models** (sonnet): Good for standard implementation, bug fixes, well-scoped features.
- **Fast models** (haiku): Best for simple, well-defined tasks — lookups, single-file edits, formatting.

If a task feels beyond your model's capability, use `wg fail` with a clear reason rather than producing low-quality output.

### Provider awareness

Tasks can specify a `--provider` (anthropic, openai, openrouter, local) to route to a specific LLM provider. The provider resolves at dispatch time: task.provider > config default.

### Execution modes

Tasks can specify `--exec-mode` to control what tools the agent receives:

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `full` | Full Claude Code tools (file editing, bash, etc.) — default | Standard implementation, debugging |
| `light` | Read-only tools (no file writes, no destructive commands) | Code review, analysis, audit |
| `bare` | Only wg CLI instructions, no extra tools | Meta-tasks, workflow management |
| `shell` | No LLM — direct shell execution of `exec` command | Scripted automation, CI/CD |

```bash
wg add "Review code" --exec-mode light
wg add "Run tests" --exec-mode shell
wg exec run-tests --set "cargo test"
```

### Context scopes

Tasks can specify a `--context-scope` that controls how much context the agent receives in its prompt:

| Scope | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `clean` | Bare executor — no wg CLI instructions | Pure computation, translation, writing |
| `task` | Task-aware with wg workflow instructions (default) | Standard implementation, bug fixes |
| `graph` | Adds project description, 1-hop neighborhood, status summary | Integration, cross-component review |
| `full` | Adds full graph summary, CLAUDE.md, system preamble | Meta-tasks, workflow design |

Set scope when creating or editing tasks:
```bash
wg add "Translate document" --context-scope clean
wg edit <task-id> --context-scope graph
```

Resolution priority: task > role default > coordinator config > "task" (default).

### Amplifier bundles (amplifier executor only)

When running under the amplifier executor (`WG_EXECUTOR_TYPE=amplifier`), you can use installed amplifier bundles for specialized capabilities. Delegate to sub-agents when:

- The subtask is independent and well-scoped (e.g. "write tests for module X")
- Parallel execution would speed things up
- The subtask needs a different skill set than your current context

Do the work yourself when:
- The task is simple and sequential
- Context from prior steps is critical and hard to transfer
- Coordination overhead would exceed the work itself

## Multi-coordinator support

The service supports multiple concurrent coordinator sessions. Each coordinator manages its own scope of tasks and agents.

```bash
wg service create-coordinator        # Create a new coordinator session
wg service stop-coordinator <id>     # Stop a coordinator (kill agent, reset to Open)
wg service archive-coordinator <id>  # Archive a coordinator (mark as Done)
wg service delete-coordinator <id>   # Delete a coordinator session
wg config --max-coordinators 4       # Set max concurrent coordinators (default: 4)
wg chat --coordinator 1 "message"    # Target a specific coordinator
```
