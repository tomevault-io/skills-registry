# Code Review Pre-Merge Gate

Use this workflow when a PR or MR is close to merge and needs the shared
delivery specialist review gate without handing provider actions to the
code-review skill itself.

## Contract

Prereqs:

- Run inside the target git repository with `git` available on `PATH`.
- `review-specialists` is installed from the released nils-cli package and
  available on `PATH`.
- The mandatory and risk lenses run through the managed read-only reviewer
  subagents dispatched by the shared specialist gate on hosts that spawn
  subagents without an explicit per-run request (e.g. Claude Code). On hosts that
  only spawn subagents on explicit request (e.g. Codex), review the lenses inline
  by default — the expected path, not a waiver — and dispatch only on explicit
  opt-in; record a waiver only when an intended dispatch genuinely fails.
- The PR/MR base branch or merge-base is known.
- Local validation and provider check evidence are available or explicitly
  marked pending by the owning delivery workflow.
- Keep this workflow read-only: it does not fix code, post PR/MR comments,
  mark reviewables ready, merge, close issues, or clean branches.

Inputs:

- PR/MR identifier or reviewable summary, base ref, head ref, validation
  evidence, and optional linked issue context.
- Optional provider-side review evidence collected read-only by the owning
  delivery workflow: reviews and review threads already posted on the PR/MR
  (typically by bot reviewers). When supplied, classify those findings with
  the same delivery outcome vocabulary as local lens findings.
- Optional forced risk lenses beyond the mandatory minimum:
  `--security`, `--performance`, `--data-migration`, `--api-contract`, or
  `--red-team`.

Outputs:

- Scope JSON from `review-specialists scope` with at least `--testing` and
  `--maintainability` forced.
- Gate result: `pass`, `request-followup`, `blocked`, or `accepted-risk`.
- Concrete findings, accepted tradeoffs, residual risks, and validation gaps.
- A delivery review outcome body suitable for the owning PR/MR delivery
  workflow to post.

Failure modes:

- Base ref is missing, ambiguous, or not the PR/MR target base.
- Required validation/check evidence is absent and no explicit pending status is
  acceptable.
- Concrete specialist findings remain unresolved and are not explicitly
  accepted by the owning delivery workflow.
- Caller tries to use this workflow to merge, close, post provider comments, or
  replace `deliver-pr` or `review-dispatch-lane-pr`.

## Entrypoint

Run the shared gate's mandatory scope detection:

```bash
review-specialists scope \
  --base "$BASE_REF" \
  --testing \
  --maintainability \
  --format json
```

Add risk lenses when warranted:

```bash
review-specialists scope \
  --base "$BASE_REF" \
  --testing \
  --maintainability \
  --security \
  --api-contract \
  --format json
```

## Workflow

1. Resolve reviewable metadata and confirm the base ref is the actual PR/MR
   target branch or merge-base.
2. Follow the shared delivery gate in
   `skills/code-review/code-review-specialists/references/DELIVERY_SPECIALIST_REVIEW_GATE.md`.
3. Run `review-specialists scope --base "$BASE_REF" --testing
   --maintainability --format json`. Do not skip small diffs.
4. Add risk lenses for security, API contract, migration, performance, or
   red-team conditions when the scope warrants them. Include red-team when
   `diff_lines > 200`, any first-wave specialist produces a `critical` finding,
   the reviewable changes safety/security-sensitive behavior, or the caller
   forced `--red-team`.
5. Review the first-wave lenses read-only by dispatching the matching managed
   reviewer subagents (`reviewer-testing`, `reviewer-maintainability`, and any
   forced risk lens such as `reviewer-security`, `reviewer-api-contract`, or
   `reviewer-performance`); collect their JSONL findings, validate and merge them,
   and classify each item using the shared delivery outcome vocabulary. (On hosts
   that only spawn subagents on explicit request, such as Codex, review these
   lenses inline by default.)
6. Dispatch `reviewer-red-team` only after the first-wave lenses, and only when
   the scope warrants it. On explicit-only hosts such as Codex, run the same
   red-team lens inline from `references/specialists/red-team.md` unless the
   user explicitly opted into subagents. Hand it the merged first-wave findings
   so it can probe cross-cutting failure modes, then validate its JSONL and merge
   the combined first-wave plus red-team JSONL before folding it into the result.
7. Classify every meaningful first-wave and red-team item using the shared
   delivery outcome vocabulary.
8. Treat evidence-backed concrete findings as blocking until repaired, accepted
   by the owner, or converted into an explicit follow-up.
9. Produce a compact gate result and delivery review outcome body. The owning
   delivery skill posts comments, reruns checks, merges, or stops.

## Boundary

`code-review-pre-merge-gate` owns the read-only review gate,
reviewer-subagent dispatch when used, inline lens execution on explicit-only
hosts, and the review outcome recommendation. Each dispatched reviewer subagent
owns only its read-only lens. Provider delivery skills own PR/MR comments, ready
transitions, checks, merge/close calls, issue closeout, and repair execution.
