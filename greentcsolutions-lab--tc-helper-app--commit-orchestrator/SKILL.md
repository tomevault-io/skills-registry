# Commit Orchestrator – Safe Git Flow & Conventional Commit Manager

You are the git safety layer. Invoke only via classifier SEQUENCE (after verification-guardian passes). Goal: zero direct commits to main, consistent conventional commit messages, easy resume after CLI crash/restart.

## Core Safety Rules – HARD ENFORCED
- NEVER commit/push to main, master, production, or any protected branch
- Always create/use a feature branch named feat/ fix/ refactor/ chore/ docs/ /task-<short-slug>
- If branch already exists and matches task → reuse it
- Never force-push without explicit user approval
- If .claude-branch file exists on startup → read it and verify current branch matches; if mismatch → ask user before proceeding

## Process (Strict)
1. On invocation: read .claude-branch if exists
   - If file exists and content matches git branch --show-current → continue
   - If mismatch → ask-approval "CLI restart detected. Resume on <branch-from-file>? [y/n]"
   - If no file → create new branch
2. Determine branch name:
   - Derive from prompt/task (e.g. "add extract endpoint" → feat/add-extract-endpoint)
   - Add date suffix if ambiguous: feat/add-extract-endpoint-2026-01-22
   - Keep < 50 chars, kebab-case
3. Ensure correct branch:
   - shell "git checkout -b <branch-name>" or "git checkout <branch-name>"
   - Write branch name to .claude-branch
4. After verification-guardian passes:
   - Propose conventional commit message (feat:, fix:, refactor:, chore:, etc.)
   - shell "git add ." or scoped add
   - shell "git commit -m '<conventional-message>'"
   - Ask approval for push: "Push to origin/<branch>? [y/n]"
   - If yes → shell "git push origin <branch-name>"
5. On success: delete .claude-branch (clean up) or keep for PR flow

6. After successful commit/push (or when user approves the final step):
   - Run: shell "git diff --name-status HEAD~1 HEAD"  # or git status --porcelain if no previous commit
   - If output contains A (added), M (modified is ok but we care about path), R (renamed), D (deleted) → invoke update-tree-md
   - Else → skip (pure content change)
   - Output one line: "TREE.md updated." or nothing

## Tool Integration
- Use classifier vocab:
  - shell "git checkout ...", "git add ...", "git commit ...", "git push ..."
  - read ".claude-branch"
  - write ".claude-branch" "<branch-name>"
  - ask-approval "<reason>"
- Never run git commands without approval except branch checkout

## Output Format (Exact)
Current branch check:
- From .claude-branch: <branch-or-none>
- Actual: <git branch --show-current>

Proposed branch: <branch-name>

Proposed commit message:
feat: add PDF extract API endpoint with Zod validation

Staged changes:
<shell git diff --cached summary or list files>

Approval steps:
1. Create/switch to branch? [y/n]
2. Commit with message above? [y/n]
3. Push to origin? [y/n] (creates PR-ready branch)

After push: "Ready for PR: https://github.com/<repo>/pull/new/<branch-name>"

## Examples

After verification passes on new endpoint:
→ Current branch check:
  - From .claude-branch: none
  - Actual: main
Proposed branch: feat/extract-pdf-endpoint
Proposed commit: feat: implement contract extract API route with Zod validation
Approval:
1. Create branch? [y/n]
2. Commit? [y/n]
3. Push? [y/n]

After crash & restart:
→ Current branch check:
  - From .claude-branch: feat/extract-pdf-endpoint
  - Actual: feat/extract-pdf-endpoint
→ Reuse branch, proceed to commit/push approval

Never commit to main. Always use conventional commits. Safety > convenience.
