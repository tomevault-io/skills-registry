# arc-finishing

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Do NOT use** for epic worktrees with `.arcforge-epic` → use `arc-finishing-epic`.

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Auto-detect test command from project files
if [ -f package.json ]; then
  npm test
elif [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then
  cargo test
elif [ -f pyproject.toml ] || [ -f setup.py ]; then
  pytest
elif [ -f go.mod ]; then
  go test ./...
else
  echo "No test command detected. Specify manually."
fi
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

```bash
# Try common base branches
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

Or ask: "This branch split from main - is that correct?"

### Step 3: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 4: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Switch to base branch
git checkout <base-branch>

# Pull latest
git pull

# Merge feature branch
git merge <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>

# If tests pass
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin <feature-branch>

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

Keep worktree until PR merged.

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

**Don't cleanup worktree.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed:
```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

### Step 5: Cleanup Worktree

**For Options 1 and 4:**

Check if in worktree:
```bash
git worktree list | grep $(git branch --show-current)
```

If yes:
```bash
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

**For Option 3:** Keep worktree.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | ✓ | - | - | ✓ |
| 2. Create PR | - | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | ✓ | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | - | ✓ (force) |

## Completion Format

### If Merged (Option 1)

```
Branch merged → <base-branch>

Branch: <feature-branch> (deleted)
Worktree: <path> (removed if applicable)
Commits: [N commits merged]

Next: Start next task, or check project status
```

### If PR Created (Option 2)

```
Pull request created → #<PR-number>

URL: <PR-URL>
Branch: <feature-branch>
Worktree: <path> (kept for now)

Next: Review PR, then merge/close and clean up worktree
```

### If Kept (Option 3)

```
Branch preserved for future work

Branch: <feature-branch>
Worktree: <path> (kept)

Next: Resume work on branch or run this skill again when ready
```

### If Discarded (Option 4)

```
Work discarded

Branch: <feature-branch> (deleted)
Worktree: <path> (removed if applicable)

Next: Start fresh or check project status
```

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without typed "discard" confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request
- Use this skill when `.arcforge-epic` exists

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping test verification**
- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" → ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options

**Automatic worktree cleanup**
- **Problem:** Remove worktree when might need it (Option 2, 3)
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4

**No confirmation for discard**
- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **arc-agent-driven** - After all tasks complete
- **arc-executing-tasks** - After all tasks complete

**Pairs with:**
- **arc-using-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill
