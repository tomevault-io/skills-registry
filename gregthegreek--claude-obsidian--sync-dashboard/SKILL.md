# Sync Dashboard

Updates `~/obsidian/research-dashboard.md` with recent research documents, status changes, and task updates.

## When to Use

- After creating significant research documents
- When project status or decisions change
- When user explicitly asks to sync or update dashboard
- Weekly task refresh

## Workflow

### 1. Archive Current Dashboard

**When to archive (before updating):**
- Major status changes (phase transitions)
- New research with changed conclusions
- Weekly review (7+ days since last archive)
- NOT required for minor content additions

Run the archive script to capture current state:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/scripts/archive-dashboard.sh
```

This creates timestamped snapshot and diff before making changes.

### 2. Scan Recent Research

Find documents created/modified in the last 7 days:

```bash
find ~/obsidian/Research -name "*.md" -type f -mtime -7 -exec ls -lt {} + | head -20
```

Read each recent document to understand:
- What it covers
- Key findings or decisions
- Numbers or projections (confirmed vs modeled)
- What needs validation

### 3. Read Current Dashboard

```bash
cat ~/obsidian/research-dashboard.md
```

Note current state:
- Active project and stage
- This week's tasks (what's checked/unchecked)
- Latest documents section
- Key numbers and decisions

### 4. Identify Changes

Compare recent documents to dashboard:
- New research documents not yet linked
- Changed status (validation phase → implementation, etc.)
- Completed tasks that should be checked off
- New numbers that replace old assumptions
- Decisions made that update "Key Decisions Needed"
- New critical questions answered

### 5. Apply Updates

Use Edit tool to update dashboard sections:
- Latest Research Documents: Add new links chronologically
- Current Status: Update phase/stage
- This Week's Critical Tasks: Check off completed, add new
- Key Decisions Needed: Update or remove resolved decisions
- What We Actually Know: Move items from "Need Validation" to "Confirmed"
- Key Numbers: Update with new data, note if still modeled

### 6. Verify

Read the updated dashboard to confirm:
- All new documents linked
- Status accurate
- Tasks reflect reality
- Numbers current
- No broken links

## Guidelines

### Maintain Existing Structure

Do NOT redesign the dashboard. Preserve:
- Section order and headers
- Formatting style (markdown lists, bold, etc.)
- Tone and language
- Date format (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Chronological Organization

Latest Research Documents section:
- **This Week** section first (current week's docs)
- **Previous Week** section below
- Move docs from "This Week" to "Previous Week" when they age
- Within each section: newest first

### Link Format

Use Obsidian wikilink format with display text:
```
- **[Document Title](Research/Subfolder/2026-01-08-filename.md)** - Brief description
```

### Facts vs Assumptions

When updating numbers:
- Mark clearly if "Confirmed" or "Modeled"
- In "What We Actually Know" section, only move to Confirmed if there's actual validation
- Keep modeling assumptions visible

### Task Hygiene

- Check off completed tasks: `- [x] Task name`
- Remove tasks that are no longer relevant (don't leave them unchecked)
- Add new tasks discovered during research
- Keep list focused: 3-5 critical tasks

### Date Management

Update "Last Updated" field at top:
```
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
```

Use current date when syncing.

## Example Updates

### Adding New Document

Before:
```markdown
### This Week (Jan 6-8)
- **[User Interview Quick Start](Research/Project-A/2026-01-08-user-interview-quick-start.md)** - 10 critical questions
```

After:
```markdown
### This Week (Jan 6-8)
- **[Risk Analysis Framework](Research/Project-A/2026-01-09-risk-analysis.md)** - Default rates and liquidity risks
- **[User Interview Quick Start](Research/Project-A/2026-01-08-user-interview-quick-start.md)** - 10 critical questions
```

### Completing Tasks

Before:
```markdown
- [ ] **User Interviews:** 8-10 target users (Wed-Fri)
```

After:
```markdown
- [x] **User Interviews:** 8-10 target users (completed 10 interviews)
```

### Updating Status

Before:
```markdown
## Current Status: Validation Phase
**Stage:** Active validation - user interviews happening this week
```

After:
```markdown
## Current Status: Decision Phase
**Stage:** Validation complete - analyzing results, making GO/NO-GO decision
```

## Important Notes

- Always archive before updating (captures history)
- Preserve user's voice and formatting
- Focus on factual updates, not editorializing
- Keep dashboard scannable: concise bullets, clear structure
- Link to actual files (verify paths exist)

## Paths Reference

- Dashboard: `~/obsidian/research-dashboard.md`
- Archive script: `~/.claude/scripts/archive-dashboard.sh`
- Research root: `~/obsidian/Research/`
- Active project folder: Check dashboard for current project path

**Note:** Paths can be customized in `~/.claude/config/paths.env`
