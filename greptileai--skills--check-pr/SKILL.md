# Check PR

Analyze a pull request (GitHub) or merge request (GitLab) for review comments, status checks, and description completeness, then help address any issues found.

## Inputs

- **PR/MR number** (optional): If not provided, detect the PR/MR for the current branch.

## Instructions

### 0. Detect platform

Inspect the git remote URL to determine whether this is a GitHub or GitLab repository:

```bash
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin)
if echo "$REMOTE_URL" | grep -qi "gitlab"; then
  VCS="gitlab"
else
  VCS="github"
fi
```

For self-hosted GitLab instances whose hostname doesn't contain "gitlab", the user can override by passing `--vcs gitlab` as an input.

### 1. Identify the PR/MR

If a number was provided, use it. Otherwise, detect it:

**GitHub:**
```bash
gh pr view --json number -q .number
```

**GitLab:**
```bash
glab mr view --output json | jq '.iid'
```

Key field differences between platforms:
- GitHub: `number`, `headRefName`, `headRefOid`
- GitLab: `iid`, `source_branch`, `sha`

### 2. Fetch PR/MR details

**GitHub:**
```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,body,state,reviews,comments,headRefName,statusCheckRollup
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments
```

**GitLab:**
```bash
glab mr view <MR_IID> --output json
# Fetch discussions (inline diff comments are type "DiffNote"; general comments have null type)
glab api "projects/:fullpath/merge_requests/<MR_IID>/discussions"
```

For GitLab, paginate discussions if needed (add `?per_page=100&page=N`).

### 3. Wait for pending checks

Before analyzing, ensure all status checks have completed. If any checks are `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS` (GitHub) / `running` or `pending` (GitLab), poll every 30 seconds until all checks reach a terminal state.

**GitHub:** poll `statusCheckRollup` from `gh pr view`.

**GitLab:**
```bash
glab api "projects/:fullpath/merge_requests/<MR_IID>/pipelines"
```
Pipeline statuses: `running`, `pending`, `success`, `failed`, `canceled`, `skipped`. Poll until no pipeline has `running` or `pending` status.

### 4. Analyze the PR/MR

Once all checks are complete, evaluate these areas:

#### A. Status Checks

- Are all CI checks passing?
- If any are failing, identify which ones and the failure reason.

#### B. PR/MR Description

- Is the description complete and follows team conventions?
- Are all required sections filled in?
- Are there TODOs or placeholders that need updating?

#### C. Review Comments

- Inline code review comments that need addressing
- Look for bot review comments (e.g. from `greptile-apps[bot]` on GitHub, or the Greptile bot user on GitLab, linters, etc.)
- Human reviewer comments

#### D. General Comments

- Discussion comments on the PR/MR
- Bot comments (deploy previews, etc.) — usually informational

### 5. Categorize issues

For each issue found, categorize as:

| Category | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Actionable** | Code changes, test improvements, or fixes needed |
| **Informational** | Verification notes, questions, or FYIs that don't require changes |
| **Already addressed** | Issues that appear to be resolved by subsequent commits |

### 6. Report findings

Present a summary table:

| Area | Issue | Status | Action Needed |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Status Checks | CI build failing | Failing | Fix type error in `src/api.ts` |
| Review | "Add null check" — @reviewer | Actionable | Add guard clause |
| Description | TODO placeholder in test plan | Actionable | Fill in test plan |
| Review | "Looks good" — @teammate | Informational | None |

### 7. Fix issues (if requested)

If there are actionable items:

1. Switch to the PR/MR's branch if not already on it.
2. Ask the user if they want to fix the issues.
3. If yes, make the fixes, commit, and push.

### 8. Resolve review threads

After addressing comments, resolve the corresponding review threads.

**GitHub** — fetch unresolved thread IDs (paginate if needed — see [the GraphQL reference](references/graphql-queries.md)):

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($cursor: String) {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100, after: $cursor) {
        pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes { body path }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

If `hasNextPage` is true, repeat with `-f cursor=ENDCURSOR` to get remaining threads.

Then resolve threads that have been addressed or are informational:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "THREAD_ID"}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}'
```

Batch multiple resolutions into a single mutation using aliases (`t1`, `t2`, etc.).

**GitLab** — fetch unresolved discussions (see [the GitLab API reference](references/gitlab-api.md)):

```bash
glab api "projects/:fullpath/merge_requests/<MR_IID>/discussions?per_page=100"
```

Filter for discussions where `"resolved": false`. Collect each discussion's `id`.

Resolve each discussion individually (GitLab has no batch resolution):

```bash
glab api --method PUT \
  "projects/:fullpath/merge_requests/<MR_IID>/discussions/<DISCUSSION_ID>" \
  --field resolved=true
```

Repeat for each unresolved discussion ID.

### 9. Multiple PRs/MRs

If checking a chain of PRs/MRs, process them sequentially.

## Output format

Summarize:
- PR/MR title and current state
- Platform detected (GitHub / GitLab)
- Status checks summary (passing/failing/pending)
- Total issues found
- Actionable items with descriptions
- Items that can be ignored with reasons
- Recommended next steps
