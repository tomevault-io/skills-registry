## Multi-User Profiles

Multiple people can track workouts independently using profiles.

```bash
# List all profiles
workout profile list

# Create a new profile
workout profile create sarah

# Delete a profile
workout profile delete old-profile
```

When multiple profiles exist, specify which one:

```bash
workout --profile mike start push-day
workout --profile mike log bench-press 185 8
workout --profile mike done
```

- **Single profile**: Commands work without `--profile` (backwards compatible)
- **Shared exercises**: Exercise library is shared across all profiles
- **Per-user data**: Templates, workouts, config, and current session are per-profile

## Workout Sessions

### Start a Workout

```bash
# Freestyle session (most common)
workout start --empty

# From template

```

# Exercise-specific note

```

### Swap & Add

workout swap bench-press dumbbell-bench-press

# Add exercise mid-workout
workout add face-pulls
```

### Finish or Cancel

```bash
# Complete and save
workout done
# Shows: duration, total sets, volume, muscles worked

# Discard without saving

```

## Typical Session

```bash
# 1. Start
workout start --empty

# 2. Log as you go
workout log lat-pulldown 100 10,10,9,8
workout note lat-pulldown "Dropped from 120 due to elbow"
workout log single-arm-cable-row 40 12,12,10
workout log single-arm-cable-row 45 10,10

# 3. Add session notes
workout note "Pull day - elbow still recovering"

# 4. Finish
workout done
```

---

## Data Storage

```
~/.workout/
  exercises.json   # Exercise library
  workouts/        # Completed sessions
```

## JSON Output

All commands support `--json`:

```bash
workout pr --json
workout last --json
workout history squat --json
```

## Gotchas

- **exercises add** requires all three: `--muscles`, `--type`, `--equipment`
- Weights are in **lbs** by default
- Multiple calls to `log` at different weights work fine (common pattern)
- `swap` moves all logged sets to the new exercise
- `note <exercise> <text>` adds note to specific exercise; `note <text>` adds session note
