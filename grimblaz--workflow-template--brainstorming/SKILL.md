description: Structured Socratic questioning for exploring ideas and solutions. Use when exploring new features, evaluating approaches, or thinking through complex decisions. DO NOT USE FOR: architecture evaluation or SOLID analysis (use software-architecture), UI component design (use frontend-design), or coordinating implementation lanes (use parallel-execution). Use when this capability is needed.

# Brainstorming Skill

Guide for structured exploration of ideas through Socratic questioning.

## When to Use

- Exploring new feature ideas or requirements
- Evaluating multiple solution approaches
- Challenging assumptions about a problem
- Breaking down complex decisions
- Early-stage design discussions

## Socratic Questioning Framework

### 1. Clarifying Questions

- What do you mean by...?
- What is the core problem we're solving?
- Can you give an example?
- What would success look like?

### 2. Probing Assumptions

- What are we assuming here?
- Why do we believe this is true?
- What if the opposite were true?
- What are we taking for granted?

### 3. Exploring Perspectives

- How would [stakeholder] view this?
- What would a user expect?
- What would a skeptic say?
- How have others solved similar problems?

### 4. Examining Evidence

- What evidence supports this approach?
- Are there counter-examples?
- What data would change our mind?
- How confident are we in this?

### 5. Considering Consequences

- What happens if we do this?
- What are the second-order effects?
- What could go wrong?
- What's the cost of being wrong?

### 6. Questioning the Question

- Is this the right question to ask?
- What question should we be asking instead?
- Are we solving the right problem?

## Brainstorming Session Structure

```
1. DEFINE (5 min)
   - State the problem/opportunity clearly
   - Identify constraints and goals

2. DIVERGE (15 min)
   - Generate many ideas without judgment
   - Build on each other's ideas
   - Encourage wild ideas

3. CHALLENGE (10 min)
   - Apply Socratic questions to top ideas
   - Identify hidden assumptions
   - Explore edge cases

4. CONVERGE (10 min)
   - Evaluate ideas against criteria
   - Combine complementary approaches
   - Select promising directions

5. NEXT STEPS (5 min)
   - Define concrete actions
   - Assign owners and timelines
```

## Project-Specific Context

[CUSTOMIZE] Add domain-specific questions relevant to your project:

- Industry-specific considerations
- Technical constraints unique to your stack
- Stakeholder perspectives to consider
- Common assumptions in your domain

## Output Artifacts

After brainstorming, document:

1. Problem statement (refined)
2. Key insights discovered
3. Assumptions identified (and which were challenged)
4. Top approaches with pros/cons
5. Decision and rationale
6. Open questions for future exploration

## Gotchas

| Trigger                                             | Gotcha                                                         | Fix                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "This approach seems good" in the first few minutes | Premature convergence — first idea is never fully examined     | Enforce a DIVERGE phase before CONVERGE; exhaust alternatives before committing          |
| Everyone agrees quickly with no pushback            | Groupthink — consensus silences better options                 | Assign devil's advocate; use §2 Probing Assumptions questions to challenge the consensus |
| 30+ minutes of questioning with no decision         | Analysis paralysis — endless questioning without converging    | Time-box phases using the Session Structure; reach CONVERGE by minute 30                 |
| Questions framed as "Shouldn't we use X?"           | Leading questions — forecloses alternatives before exploration | Rephrase as open questions per §1 Clarifying format ("What are the options here?")       |
| Socratic questions met with defensiveness           | Defensive responses — posture shuts down exploration           | Frame questions as discovery, not criticism; restate the exploration goal                |
