# Frontend Design Skill

Guide for creating distinctive, purposeful UI designs that avoid cookie-cutter patterns.

## When to Use

- Designing new UI components or screens
- Evaluating existing designs for uniqueness
- Reviewing designs that feel "generic"
- Creating brand-aligned interfaces
- Building memorable user experiences

## Core Principles

### 1. Purpose Over Pattern

Every design decision should answer: "Why this, not something else?"

- **Bad**: Using a card grid because it's common
- **Good**: Using a card grid because content is comparable and scannable

### 2. Distinctive Identity

Your UI should be recognizable without the logo.

Questions to ask:

- Would users recognize this as our product?
- What makes this different from competitors?
- Does this reflect our brand personality?

### 3. Intentional Defaults

Don't accept framework defaults blindly.

```
[CUSTOMIZE] Review these common defaults in your stack:
- Border radius values
- Shadow depths
- Spacing scales
- Color applications
- Typography scales
```

## Design Review Checklist

### Visual Distinction

- [ ] Color palette goes beyond primary/secondary/neutral
- [ ] Typography creates clear hierarchy (not just size changes)
- [ ] Spacing creates intentional rhythm (not uniform gaps)
- [ ] Icons have consistent style/weight/meaning
- [ ] Micro-interactions add personality

### Purposeful Patterns

- [ ] Each component solves a specific user problem
- [ ] Layout serves content structure (not vice versa)
- [ ] Navigation reflects user mental models
- [ ] Empty states guide users (not just "No data")
- [ ] Loading states reduce perceived wait time

### Avoiding Generic Traps

- [ ] Not using component library defaults unchanged
- [ ] Headers aren't just logo-left, nav-right
- [ ] Forms have personality beyond labels + inputs
- [ ] Buttons vary by importance (not just color)
- [ ] Data displays fit the data (not just tables)

## Breaking Generic Patterns

### Instead of Generic Cards

Consider:

- Asymmetric layouts for visual interest
- Inline expansion vs. navigation
- Progressive disclosure of details
- Content-specific shapes (not all rectangles)

### Instead of Generic Forms

Consider:

- Conversational flows for complex inputs
- Smart defaults that reduce input
- Inline validation with helpful context
- Progress indication for multi-step

### Instead of Generic Tables

Consider:

- Is a table the right pattern at all?
- Grouped/nested rows for hierarchy
- Inline actions vs. row selection
- Responsive transformations (not just scroll)

### Instead of Generic Dashboards

Consider:

- User goals, not data availability
- Actionable metrics, not vanity metrics
- Contextual insights, not just numbers
- Personalization based on role/usage

## Design Language Documentation

[CUSTOMIZE] Document your design language:

```markdown
## Our Design Personality

- [Define 3-5 adjectives: e.g., "Professional but approachable"]

## Signature Elements

- [Unique visual elements that define your brand]

## Intentional Constraints

- [Self-imposed rules that create consistency]
```

## Review Questions

Before shipping any design:

1. **Is this recognizable?** Would users know it's from us?
2. **Is this purposeful?** Can we justify every choice?
3. **Is this necessary?** Does it solve a real problem?
4. **Is this accessible?** Can all users interact with it?
5. **Is this maintainable?** Can we scale this pattern?

## Resources

[CUSTOMIZE] Add your project's design resources:

- Design system documentation
- Brand guidelines
- Component library
- Design tokens
- Approved patterns and templates

## Supplement Skills

A **supplement skill** is a project-specific skill that layers additional constraints, themes, or identity guidance on top of this hub skill. When a project has one, load both together — the hub skill provides the universal design principles and the supplement narrows them for the project.

**Naming convention**: `{project}-{hub-skill-name}` — for example, `windgust-frontend-design` supplements `frontend-design`.

**When to create one**: When your project has a unique visual identity, brand-specific design tokens, or theme customizations that go beyond what the `[CUSTOMIZE]` markers in this skill cover. If you find yourself adding the same project-specific guidance to every session, extract it into a supplement.

**Supplement ≠ replacement**: A supplement adds to the hub skill; it does not replace it. Load both together. Do not contradict hub skill defaults — extend or constrain them instead.

### Worked Example

`windgust-frontend-design` in `Grimblaz-and-Friends/Windgust-Questbook` supplements this skill with the Windgust brand personality, color palette, and component conventions specific to that project.

### Supplement SKILL.md Template

> **Note**: This template is pre-filled for `frontend-design` supplements. When creating a supplement for a different hub skill, replace every occurrence of `frontend-design` with your hub-skill name.

```markdown
---
name: {project}-frontend-design
description: Supplements `frontend-design` with {project} brand identity, design tokens, and visual conventions. Use when designing {project} UI components or screens alongside the `frontend-design` hub skill. DO NOT USE FOR: standalone sessions without `frontend-design` loaded (this is a supplement skill; always load `frontend-design` alongside).

# {Project} Frontend Design Supplement

Project-specific design constraints that layer on top of the `frontend-design` hub skill.

## Brand Identity

[CUSTOMIZE] Document brand personality, color palette, and typography rules.

## Design Tokens

[CUSTOMIZE] List token overrides that go beyond `frontend-design` defaults.

## Component Conventions

[CUSTOMIZE] List component conventions that extend `frontend-design` hub skill guidance.

## When to Use

- [CUSTOMIZE] List the conditions when this supplement should be loaded (alongside `frontend-design`).
