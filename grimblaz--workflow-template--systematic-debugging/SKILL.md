description: 4-phase debugging process (Observe, Hypothesize, Test, Fix) for complex issues. Use when debugging fails, investigating flaky tests, tracking root causes, or facing mysterious bugs. DO NOT USE FOR: writing new tests (use test-driven-development), React component test patterns (use ui-testing), or E2E test setup (use webapp-testing). Use when this capability is needed.

# Systematic Debugging

Evidence-based debugging methodology using a structured 4-phase approach.

## When to Use

- Initial debugging attempts failed
- Bug is intermittent or hard to reproduce
- Multiple potential root causes
- High-stakes fix (production, security)
- Teaching debugging skills

## The 4-Phase Process

       └──────────────────────────────────────┘
                (if hypothesis fails)
```

## Phase 1: OBSERVE

**Goal**: Gather facts without assumptions.

### Actions

- [ ] Document exact symptoms (error messages, behavior)
- [ ] Identify when it started (commit, deployment, date)
- [ ] Determine reproduction steps (or note if intermittent)
- [ ] Check logs, metrics, and monitoring
- [ ] Note what IS working (bounds the problem)

### Questions to Answer

- What exactly is happening vs. expected?
- When did this start? What changed?
- Who/what is affected? (all users, some, specific conditions)
- Can I reproduce it? How reliably?
- What have I already tried?

### Observation Log Template

```markdown
## Bug: [Brief description]

### Symptoms

- [Exact error message or behavior]

### Timeline

- First reported: [date/time]
- Last known working: [date/time]
- Related changes: [commits, deploys]

### Reproduction

- Steps: [1, 2, 3...]
- Reliability: [always/sometimes/rarely]
- Environment: [local/staging/prod]

### What Works

- [Related functionality that IS working]
```

## Phase 2: HYPOTHESIZE

**Goal**: Generate ranked theories based on evidence.

### Generate Hypotheses

Based on observations, list possible causes:

1. **Most likely** (evidence strongly supports)
2. **Possible** (evidence partially supports)
3. **Unlikely but testable** (low probability, easy to rule out)

### Ranking Criteria

- **Evidence fit**: Does it explain ALL symptoms?
- **Recency**: Recent changes more likely than old code
- **Complexity**: Simpler explanations first (Occam's Razor)
- **Testability**: Can we prove/disprove it quickly?

### Hypothesis Template

```markdown
### Hypothesis: [Theory]

Evidence for:

- [Supporting observation]

Evidence against:

- [Contradicting observation]

How to test:

- [Specific test that proves/disproves]

Likelihood: [High/Medium/Low]
```

See [debugging-phases.md](./debugging-phases.md) for detailed phase guidance.

## Phase 3: TEST

**Goal**: Validate one hypothesis at a time with evidence.

### Testing Rules

1. **One variable at a time**: Change only what tests the hypothesis
2. **Record everything**: Document what you tried and results
3. **Preserve ability to undo**: Don't make permanent changes while testing
4. **Set time limits**: Timebox each hypothesis test

### Test Log Template

```markdown
### Testing: [Hypothesis]

Test approach:

- [What I'm changing/checking]

Result:

- [What happened]

Conclusion:

- [ ] Confirmed (proceed to Fix)
- [ ] Disproved (next hypothesis)
- [ ] Inconclusive (need different test)
```

## Phase 4: FIX

**Goal**: Implement verified fix with confidence.

### Fix Checklist

- [ ] Fix addresses confirmed root cause (not just symptoms)
- [ ] Fix is minimal (no unrelated changes)
- [ ] Added test that would catch regression
- [ ] Verified fix in same environment where bug occurred
- [ ] Documented what the bug was and how it was fixed

### Post-Fix Verification

- [ ] Original reproduction steps no longer fail
- [ ] Related functionality still works
- [ ] No new errors in logs
- [ ] Performance not degraded

## Quick Debugging Toolkit

### Information Gathering

```
[CUSTOMIZE] Add your project's debugging commands:
- Log tailing: [command]
- Database queries: [tool/access]
- Metrics dashboard: [URL]
- Error tracking: [tool/URL]
```

### Common Root Causes Checklist

- [ ] Recent deployment? Check release notes
- [ ] Environment difference? Compare configs
- [ ] Data issue? Check for bad/missing data
- [ ] Dependency update? Check lock files
- [ ] Race condition? Check async code
- [ ] Resource exhaustion? Check memory/connections
- [ ] Permission change? Check access controls

## Gotchas

| Trigger                                                     | Gotcha                                                                       | Fix                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Making multiple simultaneous changes to isolate the bug     | Root cause becomes impossible to identify — can't know which change fixed it | Revert to baseline; apply one targeted change; verify; then proceed                |
| Closing the bug without adding a regression test            | Bug recurs under similar conditions undetected                               | Add a test that reproduces the original failure; confirm it is GREEN after the fix |
| Forming a hypothesis before completing Phase 1 observations | Leads investigation down the wrong path; root cause stays unexamined         | Complete Phase 1 (Observe) fully before proposing any hypothesis                   |
| Applying changes directly in the production environment     | Risk of cascading failure or data corruption                                 | Reproduce locally first; use staging environments or feature flags                 |
| Ending the session without updating the observation log     | Investigation must restart from scratch next session                         | Log dated observations before ending the session; commit the log                   |
| Making permanent code changes while testing hypotheses      | Progressive state contamination — hard to reason about current baseline      | Preserve ability to undo each test step; use feature flags or branches             |
| Fixing the symptom without root cause analysis              | Bug recurs under different conditions                                        | Follow the 4-phase protocol fully; document root cause before applying fix         |
