description: Test-Driven Development workflow guidance, quality standards, and practical patterns. Use when writing tests first, implementing to pass tests, validating quality gates, or refactoring safely. DO NOT USE FOR: debugging existing failures (use systematic-debugging), React component test patterns (use ui-testing), E2E browser tests (use webapp-testing), randomized property verification (use property-based-testing), or architecture evaluation and design decisions (use software-architecture). Use when this capability is needed.

# Test-Driven Development Skill

## Overview

This skill module provides comprehensive TDD workflow guidance, including the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle, quality gates, test patterns, and anti-patterns to avoid.

> **[CUSTOMIZE]** Examples may use a sample stack. Adapt commands and tooling for your project while preserving the same TDD principles.

## Iron Law of TDD

> A behavior is not done until a failing test proves the need, passing tests prove correctness, and refactoring preserves green tests.

<essential_principles>

## TDD Cycle: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

1. **RED**: Write a failing test that describes the expected behavior
2. **GREEN**: Implement the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

## Quality Hierarchy

Quality gates are enforced in priority order:

| Priority     | Gate             | Tool                      | Threshold | Enforcement     |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| 🥇 PRIMARY   | Mutation Testing | [CUSTOMIZE] Mutation tool | ≥80%      | Blocks merge    |
| 🥈 SECONDARY | Code Coverage    | [CUSTOMIZE] Coverage tool | ≥80%      | Blocks merge    |
| 🥉 BASELINE  | Tests Pass       | [CUSTOMIZE] Test runner   | 100%      | Always required |

**Why this order?**

- Code coverage can be 100% with weak assertions (tests run but don't verify)
- Mutation testing validates that tests actually catch bugs
- Both together ensure comprehensive, high-quality test suites

## Core Testing Principles

- **Test behavior, not implementation**: Test what code should do, not how it does it
- **No reflection hacks**: Don't test private methods via reflection
- **Test rules, not formulas**: "higher values produce larger results" not exact arithmetic
- **Keep test files focused**: Split by behavior if tests become unwieldy

## Collection / Iteration Coverage

For any function that iterates a persisted collection (`getAll()` or
`for...of` across repository results), the test plan **must** include at
least one 2-record scenario that verifies the loop applies semantics to
all members, not only the first or primary record.

- **Single-record fixtures** confirm field-level semantics.
- **Multi-record fixtures** confirm loop-level correctness.

## What do you need help with?

**TDD Phase:**

1. **write** - Writing tests first (RED phase)
2. **implement** - Making tests pass (GREEN phase)
3. **validate** - Running quality gates (coverage + mutation)
4. **refactor** - Improving code while keeping tests green (REFACTOR phase)
5. **lookup** - Reference information (patterns, commands, anti-patterns)

**What phase are you in?** _(write/implement/validate/refactor/lookup)_

| Trigger                                                                | Gotcha                                                                               | Fix                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Testing a private method via reflection (`setAccessible(true)`)        | Couples test to implementation; breaks on rename or visibility change                | Test through the public interface that exercises the private logic               |
| Asserting `verify(repo, times(1)).findById(...)` instead of the result | Breaks on caching, batching, or any refactor — tests the mechanism, not the behavior | Assert on the returned result or observable side effect, not how it was obtained |
| Testing null/empty inputs that can never occur in the system           | Bloats test suite; encourages defensive code that hides real bugs                    | Test realistic input ranges only; match edge cases to actual system boundaries   |
| `assertThat(health).isEqualTo(150)` with an exact formula match        | Breaks on any formula tweak; encodes the implementation, not the business rule       | Test comparative invariant (`highVit.health > lowVit.health`) not exact values   |
| 100% line coverage with assertions that don't verify correctness       | Coverage is green; mutations survive                                                 | Run mutation testing; require ≥80% score; review asserts on each changed line    |
| Organizing tests as one method per production method                   | Misses behavior variations and error cases; becomes a checklist                      | Organize by scenario/behavior with descriptive names; use `@Nested` groups       |
