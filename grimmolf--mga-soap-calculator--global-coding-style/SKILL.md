name: global-coding-style
description: Write reality-first code with intentional naming, small focused functions, automated formatting, and no speculative features. Use this skill when writing any code that needs clear structure, guard clauses, documented trade-offs, and deterministic side effects. Applies across all file types when making design decisions about code organization, naming conventions, removing dead code, or ensuring every line serves a proven need verified by tests or runtime execution. Use when this capability is needed.

# Global Coding Style

## When to use this skill

- When writing any code in any language or framework that needs clear, maintainable structure
- When naming variables, functions, classes, or modules to communicate purpose and constraints
- When creating functions and ensuring they have single, clearly-defined responsibilities
- When setting up or configuring automated formatting tools like Prettier, ESLint, Black, or Ruff
- When writing guard clauses to surface invalid states early in functions
- When documenting non-obvious trade-offs or design decisions in code comments
- When identifying and removing dead code, commented-out experiments, or unused imports
- When deciding whether to add backwards compatibility versus deleting legacy code
- When making functions with side effects (I/O, mutations) explicit rather than hidden
- When avoiding speculative abstractions or "future features" without proven need
- When applying linters/formatters before committing code to maintain consistency
- When refactoring code to eliminate single-letter variables outside tight algorithmic loops
- When reviewing code for formatting drift, unnecessary complexity, or unclear naming

# Global Coding Style

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global coding style.
