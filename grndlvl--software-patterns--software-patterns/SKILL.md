**Total: 147 documentation files**

## Query Commands

### Pattern Queries

```
/pattern <problem>
```

Find design patterns for a specific problem.

**Examples:**
- `/pattern create objects without knowing exact type` → Factory Method
- `/pattern add behavior dynamically` → Decorator
- `/pattern notify multiple objects of changes` → Observer
- `/pattern simplify complex subsystem` → Facade

**Routes to:** `gof-patterns` skill with pattern-selection.md

### Data Structure Queries

```
/ds <requirement>
```

Find data structures for specific requirements.

**Examples:**
- `/ds fast lookup by key` → Hash Table
- `/ds maintain sorted order` → Tree Set or Heap
- `/ds fast insert/delete at ends` → Deque
- `/ds priority queue` → Binary Heap

**Routes to:** `clrs-algorithms` skill with data-structure-selection.md

### Architecture Queries

```
/architecture <scenario>
```

Get multi-skill solution stacks combining patterns, data structures, and distributed systems concepts.

**Examples:**
- `/architecture e-commerce checkout` → State pattern + Command + Observer + distributed transactions
- `/architecture real-time leaderboard` → Sorted Set + Redis + Pub/Sub
- `/architecture multi-tenant SaaS` → Abstract Factory + Bounded Contexts + Partitioning

**Routes to:** Orchestrates across `gof-patterns`, `clrs-algorithms`, `ddia`, and `ddd`

### Implementation Queries

```
/implement <pattern> [language]
```

Generate implementation code for a pattern in a specific language.

**Examples:**
- `/implement factory method typescript`
- `/implement observer python`
- `/implement heap java`

**Routes to:** Appropriate skill with language-specific translation

### Comparison Queries

```
/compare <a> vs <b>
```

Trade-off analysis between two approaches.

**Examples:**
- `/compare factory method vs abstract factory`
- `/compare array vs linked list`
- `/compare postgres vs mongodb`
- `/compare event sourcing vs crud`

**Routes to:** Relevant skill(s) with comparison tables

## How the Router Works

### 1. Query Parsing

The router analyzes queries for problem indicators:

```yaml
patterns:
  - "create", "instantiate", "build" → Creational patterns
  - "structure", "compose", "organize" → Structural patterns
  - "behavior", "algorithm", "interact" → Behavioral patterns

data_structures:
  - "fast lookup", "search", "find" → Hash or Tree
  - "sorted", "ordered" → Tree or Heap
  - "insert", "delete", "add", "remove" → List or Tree
  - "queue", "stack", "priority" → Specialized structures

distributed_systems:
  - "scale", "partition", "shard" → ddia/partitioning
  - "replicate", "consistency" → ddia/replication
  - "distributed", "consensus" → ddia/consensus

domain_modeling:
  - "entity", "value object", "aggregate" → ddd/tactical
  - "bounded context", "ubiquitous language" → ddd/strategic
```

### 2. Skill Routing

Based on query type, routes to one or more skills:

| Query Type | Primary Skill | Supporting Skills |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Design pattern | `gof-patterns` | `clean-code` (SOLID), `ddd` (patterns) |
| Data structure | `clrs-algorithms` | `ddia` (storage engines) |
| Code quality | `clean-code` | `pragmatic-programmer` |
| Distributed systems | `ddia` | `clrs-algorithms` (graphs), `ddd` (contexts) |
| Domain modeling | `ddd` | `gof-patterns` (tactical patterns) |
| Fundamentals | `sicp` | `pragmatic-programmer` |
| Architecture | ALL | Orchestrated solution |

### 3. Cross-Skill Orchestration

For complex problems, the router orchestrates multiple skills:

**Example: "Design a caching layer for a distributed system"**

```
1. clrs-algorithms → LRU cache data structure (Hash Table + Doubly Linked List)
2. gof-patterns → Proxy pattern (control access), Flyweight (share state)
3. ddia → Replication strategies, consistency models
4. clean-code → Interface design, SOLID principles
```

**Example: "Build an e-commerce order processing system"**

```
1. ddd → Order aggregate, bounded contexts (order, payment, shipping)
2. gof-patterns → State (order states), Command (payment actions), Observer (notifications)
3. clrs-algorithms → Priority Queue (order processing), Hash Table (inventory lookup)
4. ddia → Event sourcing, CQRS, distributed transactions
5. clean-code → SRP (one class per concern), DIP (depend on abstractions)
```

## Auto-Trigger Rules

This skill activates automatically when queries contain these indicators:

### Pattern/Design Indicators
- "which pattern", "design pattern", "should I use"
- "factory", "singleton", "observer", "decorator", "adapter"
- "create objects", "add behavior", "simplify interface"

### Data Structure Indicators
- "which data structure", "fast lookup", "sorted order"
- "array", "list", "tree", "hash", "graph", "heap"
- "O(1)", "O(log n)", "complexity", "time/space"

### Architecture Indicators
- "design", "architecture", "how should I structure"
- "scalable", "distributed", "high availability"
- "microservices", "event-driven", "domain model"

### Code Quality Indicators
- "refactor", "code smell", "clean up", "improve"
- "SOLID", "DRY", "naming", "function size"
- "test", "maintainable", "readable"

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Pattern Selection

**Query:** "I need to create objects without specifying their concrete classes"

**Router Response:**
```
Primary Match: Creational Patterns (gof-patterns)

Recommendation: Factory Method Pattern

Routing to: gof-patterns/gof-creational/factory-method.md

Additional Considerations:
- If creating families of related objects → Abstract Factory
- If construction is complex → Builder
- See: gof-patterns/pattern-selection.md for decision tree
```

### Example 2: Data Structure Selection

**Query:** "What's the best data structure for fast lookup and maintaining sorted order?"

**Router Response:**
```
Primary Match: Data Structure Selection (clrs-algorithms)

Recommendation: Tree Map (Red-Black Tree or AVL Tree)

Comparison:
- Hash Table: O(1) lookup, NO sorted order
- Tree Map: O(log n) lookup, YES sorted order ✓
- Sorted Array: O(log n) search, O(n) insert ✗

Routing to: clrs-algorithms/data-structures/trees/red-black-tree.md

See also: clrs-algorithms/data-structure-selection.md
```

### Example 3: Architecture Design

**Query:** "Design a notification system that supports email, SMS, and push notifications"

**Router Response:**
```
Multi-Skill Solution:

1. Pattern Selection (gof-patterns):
   - Observer Pattern: Subscribe to events
   - Strategy Pattern: Switch between notification methods
   - Command Pattern: Queue notification actions

2. Data Structures (clrs-algorithms):
   - Priority Queue: Prioritize urgent notifications
   - Hash Table: User preference lookup

3. Distributed Systems (ddia):
   - Queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ): Async processing
   - Retry mechanisms: Handle failures

4. Code Quality (clean-code):
   - SRP: One class per notification channel
   - OCP: Add new channels without modifying existing

Implementation Stack:
Observer → Command → Priority Queue → Strategy → DIP
```

### Example 4: Code Quality Review

**Query:** "This function is 200 lines long and does too many things. How do I improve it?"

**Router Response:**
```
Primary Match: Code Quality (clean-code)

Violations Detected:
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - function does too many things
2. Function size - should be 5-20 lines

Refactoring Steps:
1. Extract methods for each responsibility (clean-code/practices/functions.md)
2. Apply SRP (clean-code/solid/single-responsibility.md)
3. Use meaningful names (clean-code/practices/meaningful-names.md)

Supporting Guidance:
- pragmatic-programmer/practices/refactoring.md: When and how to refactor
- gof-patterns: Consider Template Method or Strategy if algorithm varies

Tools:
- Extract Method refactoring
- Compose Method pattern
- Replace Temp with Query
```

## Language Translation Notes

All examples use language-agnostic pseudocode with these conventions:
- `class` for type definitions
- `function` for methods/functions
- `->` for method calls on objects
- `//` for comments
- Type hints shown as `name: Type`

### Translation Guide

| Language | Class | Method | Call | Comment | Types |
|----------|-------|--------|------|---------|-------|
| **PHP** | `class` | `function` | `->` | `//` | Docblocks or PHP 8+ |
| **JavaScript** | `class` | `function` / arrow | `.` | `//` | JSDoc or TypeScript |
| **TypeScript** | `class` | method / arrow | `.` | `//` | Native types |
| **Python** | `class` | `def` | `.` | `#` | Type hints |
| **Java** | `class` | method | `.` | `//` | Native types |
| **C#** | `class` | method | `.` | `//` | Native types |
| **Go** | `type` / `struct` | `func` | `.` | `//` | Native types |
| **Rust** | `struct` / `trait` | `fn` | `.` | `//` | Native types |

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Multiple Skills

For complex problems, explicitly request multi-skill analysis:

```
"I need a comprehensive solution for [problem] covering patterns, data structures, and distributed systems"
```

The router will orchestrate across all relevant skills and provide:
1. Pattern recommendations (gof-patterns)
2. Data structure choices (clrs-algorithms)
3. Scalability considerations (ddia)
4. Domain modeling (ddd if applicable)
5. Code quality guidelines (clean-code)
6. Implementation best practices (pragmatic-programmer)

### Deep Dives

Request detailed documentation from specific skills:

```
"Show me the full Observer pattern documentation"
→ Routes to: gof-patterns/gof-behavioral/observer.md

"Explain Red-Black Tree implementation with examples"
→ Routes to: clrs-algorithms/data-structures/trees/red-black-tree.md

"What are all SOLID principles?"
→ Routes to: clean-code/solid/ (all 5 principles)
```

### Comparison Queries

Request trade-off analysis:

```
"/compare singleton vs dependency injection"
→ Multi-skill analysis from gof-patterns + clean-code

"/compare b-tree vs lsm-tree"
→ Multi-skill analysis from clrs-algorithms + ddia

"/compare entity vs value object"
→ Analysis from ddd/tactical/
```

## Tips for Effective Use

### 1. Start with Problem, Not Solution

❌ "Show me the Singleton pattern"
✅ "I need exactly one instance of a configuration manager"

The router will recommend the right pattern and warn about potential issues.

### 2. Provide Context

❌ "Which data structure should I use?"
✅ "I need fast lookup by key and sorted iteration over 10,000 items"

Context enables better routing and recommendations.

### 3. Ask About Trade-offs

✅ "What are the trade-offs between Factory Method and Abstract Factory?"
✅ "When should I use Array vs Linked List?"
✅ "Compare event sourcing vs traditional CRUD"

Trade-off queries trigger comparison mode with tables and decision guides.

### 4. Request Implementation Guidance

✅ "How do I implement LRU cache in TypeScript?"
✅ "Show me Observer pattern in Python"
✅ "Implement Repository pattern in PHP"

Includes language-specific code generation with best practices.

### 5. Explore Related Concepts

After getting a recommendation, ask:
- "What patterns work well with [pattern]?"
- "What are common combinations with [data structure]?"
- "How does [concept] relate to [other concept]?"

## Contributing

To add new patterns, algorithms, or concepts to any skill:
1. Follow the established format in existing documentation
2. Include definition, when to use, implementation, examples, trade-offs
3. Update the relevant SKILL.md quick reference tables
