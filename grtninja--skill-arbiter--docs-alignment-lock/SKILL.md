# Docs Alignment Lock

Use this skill to keep documentation policy-consistent and public-safe.

## Workflow

1. Read `AGENTS.md` first and treat it as policy source of truth.
2. Align policy language across:
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `README.md`
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - `SKILL.md`
   - `.github/pull_request_template.md`
   - repo-local scope/status docs when they are part of the shipped contract (`docs/PROJECT_SCOPE.md`, `docs/SCOPE_TRACKER.md`, reconciliation notes, startup rosters, USB handoff docs)
3. Enforce public-shape rules in docs and skill candidates:
   - no private repo identifiers
   - no user-specific absolute paths
   - use placeholders (`<PRIVATE_REPO_A>`, `<PRIVATE_REPO_B>`, `<PRIVATE_REPO_C>`, `<PRIVATE_REPO_D>`, `$CODEX_HOME/skills`, `$env:USERPROFILE\\...`)
4. Ensure skill update messaging rule is present and aligned:
   - `New Skill Unlocked: <SkillName>`
   - `<SkillName> Leveled up to <LevelNumber>`
5. Run privacy and release checks.
6. If release-impacting docs/scripts changed, prepare a patch release bump.
7. For multi-repo work, ensure the changed behavior is explicitly documented where the open diffs actually live, not only in a central control repo.

## Commands

```bash
python3 scripts/check_private_data_policy.py
python3 scripts/check_release_hygiene.py
python3 -m py_compile scripts/arbitrate_skills.py scripts/prepare_release.py scripts/check_release_hygiene.py scripts/check_private_data_policy.py
```

For release-impacting changes:

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare_release.py --part patch
```
## Scope Boundary

Use this skill only for the `docs-alignment-lock` lane and workflow defined in this file and its references.

Do not use this skill for unrelated lanes; route those through `$skill-hub` and the most specific matching skill.

## Reference

- `references/docs-alignment-checklist.md`

## Loopback

If this lane is unresolved, blocked, or ambiguous:

1. Capture current evidence and failure context.
2. Route back through `$skill-hub` for chain recalculation.
3. Resume only after the updated chain returns a deterministic next step.
