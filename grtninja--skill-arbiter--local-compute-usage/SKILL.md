# Local Compute Usage

Use this skill when work must stay on local compute across service and hardware surfaces.

## Workflow

1. Run local preflight to validate workspace, VS Code CLI availability, endpoint host locality, hardware readiness commands, and live loopback accounting where available.
2. Pin runtime URLs and guardrail env vars to loopback/local values and normalize any legacy `Documents\GitHub` repo aliases to `G:\GitHub`.
3. Route execution through existing local service and hardware skills (especially MemryX shim lanes).
4. Fail closed if non-local hosts, missing live stack evidence, or hardware-check failures are detected when the lane requires them.

## Local Preflight

Run from the active workspace root:

```bash
python3 "$CODEX_HOME/skills/local-compute-usage/scripts/local_compute_preflight.py" \
  --workspace-root . \
  --require-vscode \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:9000/health \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:10000 \
  --probe-http \
  --strict-probe \
  --hardware-check "acclBench --hello" \
  --stack-health-url http://127.0.0.1:9000/health \
  --stack-summary-url http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/accounting/summary \
  --json-out /tmp/local-compute-preflight.json
```
For non-MemryX hardware lanes, replace `--hardware-check` with lane-appropriate local hardware commands.

## MemryX Shim-First Routing

When the user is actively working on MemryX shim flows:

1. Use `$repo-b-control-center-ops` for service startup/restart and endpoint readiness.
2. Use `$repo-b-hardware-first` for real-hardware diagnostics and deterministic probe evidence.
3. Use `$memryx-official-hardware-check` when official service checks fail (`127.0.0.1:10000` path).
4. Use `$repo-b-thin-waist-routing` and `$repo-b-mcp-comfy-bridge` for API/MCP routing diagnostics.
5. Use `$repo-b-local-bridge-orchestrator` for read-only bridge orchestration.

## Local Environment Defaults (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:REPO_B_SIDECAR_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:9000"
$env:REPO_B_FORCE_LOCAL_ONLY = "1"
$env:REPO_B_CONTINUE_BRIDGE_ENABLED = "1"
$env:REPO_B_CONTINUE_MODE = "read_only"
$env:REPO_B_CONTINUE_ALLOWED_ROOTS = "G:\GitHub\<PRIVATE_REPO_B>"
```

## Guardrails

1. Do not route required service traffic to non-local hosts unless the user explicitly authorizes it.
2. Do not skip required hardware checks for hardware-backed workflows.
3. Prefer local scripts, local MCP adapters, local service endpoints, and local hardware probes over cloud-hosted alternatives.
4. Treat hostname drift or hardware-check failure as a policy violation and stop before mutation steps.
5. If the stack publishes positive displacement preview or healthy TPK, use that as evidence for stronger local-first routing rather than an optional hint.
6. Treat `http://127.0.0.1:9000/v1` and `http://127.0.0.1:2337/v1` as the authoritative model lanes; treat `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1` only as a non-authoritative operator surface.

## Scope Boundary

Use this skill when the task is primarily about enforcing local compute usage policy and local service/hardware routing.

Do not use this skill for:

1. Deep repo-specific debugging that already has a dedicated skill lane.
2. Remote cluster/cloud execution plans.

For those lanes, route through `$skill-hub` and the most specific matching skill.

- `scripts/local_compute_preflight.py`

## Loopback

If this lane is unresolved, blocked, or ambiguous:

1. Capture current evidence and failure context.
2. Route back through `$skill-hub` for chain recalculation.
3. Resume only after the updated chain returns a deterministic next step.
