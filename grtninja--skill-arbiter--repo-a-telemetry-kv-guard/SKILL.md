# Repo A DDC Telemetry and KV Guard

Use this skill to keep telemetry and storage behavior safe and deterministic.

## Guardrails

1. Preserve append-only repo_c_trace NDJSON behavior.
2. Keep telemetry envelopes signed when configured.
3. Enforce Repo C privacy class and TTL gating at role entry.
4. Preserve encrypted KV paging behavior (AES-GCM + TTL enforcement).
5. Avoid storing raw prompts/responses or PII at rest.

## Validation Commands

Run from `<PRIVATE_REPO_A>` root:

```bash
ruff check .
pytest -q tests/telemetry tests/policy tests/test_trace_client.py
python -m repo_a_node --policy config/device_policy.json --selftest config/mesh_ready_selftest.yaml
```

## Contract Targets

- KV API semantics stay stable:
  - `put(key: bytes, val: bytes, tier: str, ttl_s: int) -> None`
  - `get(key: bytes) -> Optional[bytes]`
- Telemetry events remain compact and append-only with rotation behavior intact.
## Scope Boundary

Use this skill only for the `repo-a-telemetry-kv-guard` lane and workflow defined in this file and its references.

Do not use this skill for unrelated lanes; route those through `$skill-hub` and the most specific matching skill.

## Reference

- `references/privacy-kv-checks.md`

## Loopback

If this lane is unresolved, blocked, or ambiguous:

1. Capture current evidence and failure context.
2. Route back through `$skill-hub` for chain recalculation.
3. Resume only after the updated chain returns a deterministic next step.
