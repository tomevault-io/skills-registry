# REPO_B Shim Preflight and Doc Sync

Use this skill for PR-readiness and governance updates.

## Workflow

1. Run required preflight commands for the change scope.
2. Capture command evidence and failures with explicit repro notes.
3. Keep docs in lockstep for behavior changes.
   - include repo-local reconciliation docs when the repo is carrying major unreleased open diffs
   - include startup/state-persistence docs when launch behavior changed
4. Add target-PC rerun steps when hardware-only checks cannot run locally.

## Scope Boundary

Use this skill for release-readiness gate execution and docs synchronization before PRs.

Do not use this skill for:

1. Runtime agent bridge behavior debugging.
2. Hybrid Windows/WSL connectivity diagnosis.
3. Strict hardware probe root-cause workflows.

## Required Preflight Profiles

```powershell
pwsh -File tools/preflight.ps1
pwsh -File tools/preflight.ps1 -Fast
pwsh -File tools/preflight.ps1 -Node
pwsh -File tools/preflight.ps1 -Hardware -ForceReal -MemryxOnly -VerboseOutput
```

```bash
python tools/preflight.py
```

## Documentation Lockstep

Review and update together when behavior changes:

- `README.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_SCOPE.md`
- `docs/SCOPE_TRACKER.md`
- repo-local reconciliation/startup notes when present

## References

- PR gate checklist: `references/pr-gate-checklist.md`

## Loopback

If this lane is unresolved, blocked, or ambiguous:

1. Capture current evidence and failure context.
2. Route back through `$skill-hub` for chain recalculation.
3. Resume only after the updated chain returns a deterministic next step.
