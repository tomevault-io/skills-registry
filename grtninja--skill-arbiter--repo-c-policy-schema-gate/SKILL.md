# Repo C Policy Schema Gate

Use this skill to enforce policy/schema correctness.

## Workflow

1. Validate policy files with the CLI.
2. Confirm schema updates remain backward-compatible for consumers.
3. Run lint/tests for affected policy and schema code.

## Scope Boundary

Use this skill for policy manifests, schema files, and policy validation tooling.

Do not use this skill for:

1. NDJSON trace packet integrity checks.
2. Ranking engine scoring/report contract changes.
3. Cross-repo boundary governance wording/architecture checks.

## Core Commands

Run from `<PRIVATE_REPO_C>` root:

```bash
python -m tools.policy_validate policies/repo-c_policy.yaml
python -m tools.policy_validate policies/device_policy.json
ruff check .
pytest -q
```

## Output Requirements

- No policy validation failures.
- Any schema change includes matching test updates.
- Policy docs reflect new required/optional fields.

## Reference

- `references/policy-files.md`

## Loopback

If this lane is unresolved, blocked, or ambiguous:

1. Capture current evidence and failure context.
2. Route back through `$skill-hub` for chain recalculation.
3. Resume only after the updated chain returns a deterministic next step.
