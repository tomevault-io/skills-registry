# Skill Blast-Radius Simulator

Use this skill to estimate operational risk before enabling or installing new skills.

## Workflow

1. Select candidate skills to evaluate.
2. Run static blast-radius simulation.
3. Compare against baseline scores when available.
4. Require explicit acknowledgement for high-risk or high-delta results.

## Simulate

```bash
python3 "$CODEX_HOME/skills/skill-blast-radius-simulator/scripts/blast_radius_sim.py" \
  --skills-root skill-candidates \
  --skill my-new-skill \
  --ack-threshold high \
  --json-out /tmp/blast-radius-report.json \
  --format table
```

Compare to a previous run:

```bash
python3 "$CODEX_HOME/skills/skill-blast-radius-simulator/scripts/blast_radius_sim.py" \
  --skills-root skill-candidates \
  --skill my-new-skill \
  --baseline-json /tmp/previous-blast-radius-report.json \
  --json-out /tmp/blast-radius-report.json
```
## Scope Boundary

Use this skill only for the `skill-blast-radius-simulator` lane and workflow defined in this file and its references.

Do not use this skill for unrelated lanes; route those through `$skill-hub` and the most specific matching skill.

## References

- `references/simulation-workflow.md`
- `references/risk-heuristics.md`

## Loopback

If this lane is unresolved, blocked, or ambiguous:

1. Capture current evidence and failure context.
2. Route back through `$skill-hub` for chain recalculation.
3. Resume only after the updated chain returns a deterministic next step.
