# Common-Sense Engineering

Lightweight sanity layer for day-to-day coding work. Prevents avoidable mistakes by enforcing pre/post checks on every change.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify the goal** — state the objective in one sentence before choosing tools or edits.
2. **Audit dependency surface** — trace related contracts, dependents, and operator-facing surfaces before deciding the implementation boundary.
3. **Execute the change** — prefer existing scripts/workflows over ad hoc steps.
4. **Run common-sense checks** before concluding:
   ```bash
   git status --short
   python3 scripts/check_private_data_policy.py
   python3 "$CODEX_HOME/skills/skill-arbiter-lockdown-admission/scripts/artifact_hygiene_scan.py" . --fail-on-found
   ```
5. **Verify guardrail evidence** for multi-skill chains:
   ```bash
   test -f /tmp/usage-analysis.json && test -f /tmp/usage-plan.json
   test -f /tmp/skill-cost-analysis.json && test -f /tmp/skill-cost-policy.json
   test -f /tmp/cold-warm-analysis.json && test -f /tmp/cold-warm-plan.json
   ```
6. **Capture evidence** — summarize what was checked, what was fixed, and any unresolved risks.
7. If a repeatable issue appeared, update the relevant skill or checklist in the same change.

## Decision Heuristics

1. Between two fixes, choose the one that leaves the dependency graph clearer.
2. If a change cannot be explained in one sentence, document the scope rather than under-fixing.
3. If a failure can recur, codify it in a skill/workflow instead of relying on memory.
4. If evidence is missing, do not claim success.

## Scope Boundary

Use this skill only for common-sense engineering checks.

Do not use this skill for unrelated lanes; route those through `$skill-hub` and the most specific matching skill.

## References

- `references/common-sense-checklist.md` — full before/during/after checklist.

## Loopback

If this lane is unresolved, blocked, or ambiguous:

1. Capture current evidence and failure context.
2. Route back through `$skill-hub` for chain recalculation.
3. Resume only after the updated chain returns a deterministic next step.
