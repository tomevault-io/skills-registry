# Development Workflow

A 7-phase loop for taking features and bugs from idea to verified, reviewed completion. Task files are persistent memory. Only the user closes tasks.

## Philosophy

- **Declarative, not imperative.** Define success criteria and constraints — let Claude figure out the approach. This gives room to loop, try alternatives, and self-correct.
- **Task files are persistent memory.** Claude Code doesn't remember between sessions. Task files in `docs/tasks/open/` ARE the memory — every session reads the file, sees what was tried, and resumes.
- **Only the user can close a task.** Claude sets status to "needs verification" — never "done." The user tests, confirms each Done Criterion, and says "close it out."
- **Code review is not optional.** Every task that changes code gets reviewed before close-out. Code review follows the same plan/explore/review/execute loop as the main workflow. Skipping review leads to disasters — the hook enforces this.

## The 7 Phases

| Phase | Where | Who Drives | Output |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1. Plan | Claude.ai | User + Claude.ai | Success criteria, constraints, execution mode |
| 2. Explore | Claude Code | Claude | Task file created, codebase explored, plan generated |
| 3. Review | Claude.ai | Claude.ai | Plan challenged, improved, agents assigned if team mode |
| 4. Execute | Claude Code | Claude | Code changes implemented, attempts logged after every change |
| 5. Code Review | Claude.ai + Claude Code | User + Claude | Review planned, executed, findings logged and addressed |
| 6. Verify | Claude Code + User | User | Done Criteria walked through one by one |
| 7. Close-out | Claude Code | User | Retro entry appended, task moved to closed/ |

**Phase 1 — Plan:** Come to Claude.ai with a feature or bug. Together define success criteria (specific, testable), tests that prove it works, constraints (what NOT to do), and whether to use single-agent or agent-team execution.

**Phase 2 — Explore:** Paste the prompt into Claude Code. Always check `docs/tasks/open/` first. Either resume an existing task or create a new one. Explore the codebase and generate a plan.

**Phase 3 — Review:** Bring the plan back to Claude.ai. Challenge assumptions, check for over-engineering, verify it's a real fix (not a band-aid). For agent teams, assign file ownership with zero overlap.

**Phase 4 — Execute:** Implement the plan. After EVERY code change attempt, append to the task file's Attempts log immediately (not batched). Attempts log is append-only — never overwrite or delete entries.

**Phase 5 — Code Review:** After execution completes, plan and execute a code review. This is a sub-loop:

1. **Plan the review (Claude.ai):** Bring the recent commits/changes to Claude.ai. Together define what to review — architecture decisions, edge cases, error handling, security, performance. Claude.ai produces a review prompt, splitting by agents if the changes span multiple areas.
2. **Explore for review (Claude Code):** Send the review prompt to Claude Code. It examines the changes and generates a review plan — what to check, in what order, what to look for.
3. **Refine the review plan (Claude.ai):** Bring the review plan back to Claude.ai. Challenge it — are we checking the right things? Missing edge cases? Over-focusing on style vs substance?
4. **Execute the review (Claude Code):** Run the review. Log every finding in the task file's "Code Review Findings" section. Fix issues found. Re-run tests after fixes.

Set `## Code Review: completed` when all findings are addressed. For tasks that genuinely don't need review (documentation-only, config changes), set `## Code Review: not required` during Phase 1 planning.

**Phase 6 — Verify:** After code review completes (or is marked not required), set status to "needs verification" and walk through each Done Criterion with the user. User confirms or rejects each one. Only the user can mark checkboxes and approve completion. This is the final gate before close-out.

**Phase 7 — Close-out:** User says "close it out." Append a retro entry (use the retro skill for format), then move the task file from `docs/tasks/open/` to `docs/tasks/closed/`.

## Declarative Prompting

**Include:** Success criteria, tests that prove it works, constraints, relevant context.

**Do NOT include:** Step-by-step implementation instructions, specific line numbers to change, exact code to write.

Good:
> "Success criteria: The /api/users endpoint returns paginated results with correct schema. All date fields use ISO 8601 format. Constraint: Don't add new database tables."

Bad:
> "Fix user_service.py line 312. Change the mapping from 'active' to match the schema. Then update the test. Then run pytest."

The declarative version lets Claude explore, loop, and self-correct. The imperative version breaks if line numbers shift or the mapping needs a different approach.

## Session Hygiene

**Start every session:** Check `docs/tasks/open/` first. If a task matches the current work, read it and resume from "Left Off At." Never retry approaches logged in Attempts.

**End every session:** Summarize what changed (every file, with specifics), test results (with counts), and what's left. Update the task file's "Left Off At" with a specific resumption point.

## Agent Teams

Use agent teams when ALL four criteria are met:

1. Work spans **multiple files** with clear ownership boundaries
2. Tasks can run **independently in parallel** (no sequential dependencies)
3. Each piece produces a **clear deliverable** (a function, a test file, a component)
4. Time savings from parallelization **outweigh coordination overhead**

Quick decision check: *"Can I draw file-ownership lines with zero overlap?"* Yes → team candidate. No → single agent.

**Team execution rules:** Lead agent uses delegate mode, owns the task file exclusively. Teammates report via messaging. Lead logs teammate work to Attempts with role tags (e.g., `[Teammate: API]`).

## Decision Tree

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "Fix this bug" / "Add this feature" | Check `docs/tasks/open/` for existing task → create task file if none → explore → plan |
| "Check tasks" / "What's open?" | List all files in `docs/tasks/open/` with Status and Goal |
| "Resume [task name]" | Read the task file, pick up from "Left Off At", never retry failed Attempts |
| "Start code review" | Begin Phase 5 — plan the review with Claude.ai, execute with Claude Code |
| "Code review not needed" | Set `## Code Review: not required` in the task file |
| "Close it out" | Check code review status → append retro entry (see retro skill) → move task to `docs/tasks/closed/` |
| "Use a team for this" | Verify 4 agent-team criteria, set up team structure with file ownership map |
| "What was tried?" | Read the task file's Attempts section and summarize |

## Cross-References

- **Task file CRUD rules and template:** See the task-manager skill
- **Retro entry format and rules:** See the retro skill
- **Plan self-check before execution:** See the plan-review skill
- **Hook enforcement:** Workflow rules are enforced by automated hooks — task status, venv activation, retro-before-close, review-before-close, and session close-out summaries
