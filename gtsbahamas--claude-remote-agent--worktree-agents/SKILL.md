# Worktree Agent Management

This skill helps manage parallel development using git worktrees with AI coding agents. Each worktree is an isolated copy of the repo on a different branch, allowing multiple Claude Code agents to work simultaneously without conflicts.

## When This Skill Activates

**Trigger phrases:**
- "spin up worktrees for X, Y, Z"
- "create worktrees and launch agents"
- "parallelize work on these features"
- "what's the status of my worktrees?"
- "launch agent in worktree X"
- "clean up merged worktrees"
- "clean up the X worktree"

## Intent

The user wants to:
1. **Create**: Set up isolated worktrees for parallel feature development
2. **Launch**: Start Claude Code agents in those worktrees
3. **Monitor**: See what's running and what state each worktree is in
4. **Cleanup**: Remove worktrees after PRs are merged

## CRITICAL: Directory Structure

**All worktrees MUST be created in the `worktrees/` subdirectory** relative to the repo root.

```
repo-root/
├── worktrees/                          # All worktrees go here
│   ├── feature/auth/                   # Branch: feature/auth
│   ├── feature/payments/               # Branch: feature/payments
│   └── fix/login-bug/                  # Branch: fix/login-bug
├── src/
├── .claude/
└── ...
```

**NEVER create worktrees as sibling directories** (e.g., `../repo-feature-auth`). This breaks:
- Status tracking
- Cleanup scripts
- Registry path matching

**Correct:**
```bash
git worktree add worktrees/feature/auth -b feature/auth
```

**Wrong:**
```bash
git worktree add ../repo-feature-auth -b feature/auth  # NO!
```

## Architecture

## What You (Claude) Do vs What Scripts Do

| Task | Who Does It | How |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Create git worktree | **You** | `git worktree add worktrees/<branch> -b <branch>` |
| Copy .agents/ directory | **You** | `cp -r .agents worktrees/<branch>/` (for plans, RCAs, etc.) |
| Install dependencies | **You** | `cd worktrees/<branch> && npm install` |
| Run validation | **You** | `npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm test` |
| Pick next available port | **You** | Look at registry, find unused port in range |
| Register worktree | **Script** | `scripts/register.sh <branch> <path> <port> [task]` |
| Launch agent in terminal | **Script** | `scripts/launch-agent.sh <path> [task]` |
| Show status | **Script** | `scripts/status.sh` |
| Full cleanup | **Script** | `scripts/cleanup.sh <branch> [--delete-branch]` |
| Check PR status | **You** | `gh pr list --head <branch> --json number,state` |
| Decide what to clean | **You** | Check if PR merged, ask user if unsure |

## IMPORTANT: Copy .agents/ Directory

**Why**: Uncommitted files (plans, RCA reports, PRPs) only exist in the source worktree. New worktrees start clean from git, so these files won't be there.

**Always copy** the `.agents/` directory to new worktrees so the agent has access to:
- `.agents/plans/` - Implementation plans to execute
- `.agents/rca-reports/` - Root cause analysis reports
- `.agents/PRPs/` - Product requirement plans

```bash
# After creating worktree, copy .agents/
cp -r .agents worktrees/<branch>/.agents
```

## Port Allocation

Ports are assigned from the configured range (default: 8124-8128).

**To find next available port:**
1. Read `.claude/worktree-registry.json`
2. Get list of used ports: `jq '.worktrees[].port' .claude/worktree-registry.json`
3. Pick first unused port in range

**Port range** (from config.json):
- Default: 8124, 8125, 8126, 8127, 8128
- Maximum 5 concurrent worktrees

---

## Workflows

### 1. Create Worktrees with Agents

**User says:** "Spin up worktrees for feature/auth and feature/payments"

**You do:**

```
1. For each branch:
   a. Find next available port (check registry)
   b. Create worktree:
      git worktree add worktrees/<branch> -b <branch>
   c. Copy .agents/ directory (plans, RCAs, PRPs):
      cp -r .agents worktrees/<branch>/.agents
   d. Install dependencies:
      cd worktrees/<branch> && npm install
   e. Run validation (optional but recommended):
      npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm test
   f. Register:
      scripts/register.sh <branch> worktrees/<branch> <port> "[task]"
   g. Launch agent:
      scripts/launch-agent.sh worktrees/<branch> "[task]"

2. Report summary to user
```

**Example commands:**
```bash
# Create worktrees
git worktree add worktrees/feature/auth -b feature/auth
git worktree add worktrees/feature/payments -b feature/payments

# Copy .agents/ directory (uncommitted plans, RCAs, etc.)
cp -r .agents worktrees/feature/auth/.agents
cp -r .agents worktrees/feature/payments/.agents

# Install deps
cd worktrees/feature/auth && npm install
cd worktrees/feature/payments && npm install

# Register (finds script in .claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/)
.claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/register.sh feature/auth worktrees/feature/auth 8124 "Implement OAuth"
.claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/register.sh feature/payments worktrees/feature/payments 8125 "Add Stripe"

# Launch agents
.claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/launch-agent.sh worktrees/feature/auth "Implement OAuth"
.claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/launch-agent.sh worktrees/feature/payments "Add Stripe"
```

### 2. Check Status

**User says:** "What's the status?" or "Show my worktrees"

**You do:**
```bash
.claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/status.sh
```

This shows:
- All registered worktrees
- Port assignments
- PR status (fetched from GitHub)
- When agent was launched
- Whether worktree directory exists

### 3. Launch Agent in Existing Worktree

**User says:** "Launch an agent in the auth worktree"

**You do:**
```bash
# Find the worktree path
git worktree list | grep auth

# Launch
.claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/launch-agent.sh worktrees/feature/auth "Continue auth work"
```

### 4. Cleanup Worktrees

**User says:** "Clean up the auth worktree" or "Clean up merged worktrees"

**For single worktree:**
```bash
# Check if PR is merged first
gh pr list --head feature/auth --state merged

# If merged (or user confirms), clean up
.claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/cleanup.sh feature/auth

# To also delete the git branch:
.claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/cleanup.sh feature/auth --delete-branch
```

**For "merged" worktrees:**
```bash
# Get list of registered worktrees
cat .claude/worktree-registry.json

# For each, check if PR is merged
gh pr list --head <branch> --state merged --json number

# Clean up those with merged PRs
.claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/cleanup.sh <branch> --delete-branch
```

**Cleanup script handles:**
- Killing processes on the port
- Removing worktree directory
- Pruning git references
- Unregistering from registry
- Optionally deleting local+remote branches

## Registry Schema

Location: `.claude/worktree-registry.json`

```json
{
  "worktrees": [
    {
      "branch": "feature/auth",
      "path": "worktrees/feature/auth",
      "port": 8124,
      "createdAt": "2025-12-02T10:00:00Z",
      "agentLaunchedAt": "2025-12-02T10:05:00Z",
      "task": "Implement OAuth login",
      "prNumber": null
    }
  ]
}
```

**You update `agentLaunchedAt`** after launching by re-running register.sh (it updates existing entries).

**You update `prNumber`** when you discover a PR exists:
```bash
# Check for PR
PR_NUM=$(gh pr list --head feature/auth --json number --jq '.[0].number')

# Update registry with jq
jq ".worktrees |= map(if .branch == \"feature/auth\" then .prNumber = $PR_NUM else . end)" \
  .claude/worktree-registry.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json .claude/worktree-registry.json
```

---

## Configuration

Location: `.claude/skills/worktree-agents/config.json`

```json
{
  "terminal": "ghostty",      // ghostty, iterm2, or tmux
  "shell": "fish",            // fish, bash, or zsh
  "claudeCommand": "cc",      // command to launch Claude Code
  "portRange": {
    "start": 8124,
    "end": 8128
  }
}
```

**Terminal options:**
- `ghostty` - Opens new Ghostty window (macOS)
- `iterm2` - Opens new iTerm2 window (macOS)
- `tmux` - Creates new tmux session (cross-platform)

./scripts/launch-agent.sh <worktree-path> [task-description]

# Examples:
./scripts/launch-agent.sh worktrees/feature/auth
./scripts/launch-agent.sh worktrees/feature/auth "Implement OAuth login"
```

### register.sh
```bash
./scripts/register.sh <branch> <path> <port> [task]

```

### cleanup.sh
```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh <branch> [--delete-branch]

# Examples:
./scripts/cleanup.sh feature/auth                    # Keep git branch
./scripts/cleanup.sh feature/auth --delete-branch   # Delete branch too
```

### status.sh
```bash
./scripts/status.sh
```

## Safety Guidelines

1. **Before cleaning up**, check PR status:
   - If PR is merged: safe to clean up everything
   - If PR is open: warn user, confirm before proceeding
   - If no PR: warn user there may be unsubmitted work

2. **Before deleting branches**, confirm with user if:
   - PR is not merged
   - No PR exists
   - Worktree has uncommitted changes

3. **Port conflicts**: If a port is in use by a non-worktree process, pick a different port

4. **Max 5 worktrees**: The default port range only supports 5 concurrent worktrees

---

## Common Issues

### "Port already in use"
```bash
# Find what's using it
lsof -i :8124

# Kill if it's a stale process
kill -9 <PID>
```

### "Worktree already exists"
```bash
# Check existing worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove if stale
git worktree remove worktrees/<branch> --force
git worktree prune
```

### "Branch already exists"
The git worktree command handles this:
```bash
# This tries -b (new branch) first, falls back to existing
git worktree add worktrees/<branch> -b <branch> 2>/dev/null || git worktree add worktrees/<branch> <branch>
```

### Registry out of sync
```bash
# Compare registry to actual worktrees
cat .claude/worktree-registry.json
git worktree list

# Manually clean up stale entries
.claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/unregister.sh <stale-branch>
```

## Example Session

**User:** "Spin up 2 worktrees for feature/dark-mode and fix/login-bug, then launch agents"

**You:**
1. Check registry for used ports → none used, start with 8124
2. Create worktrees:
   ```bash
   git worktree add worktrees/feature/dark-mode -b feature/dark-mode
   git worktree add worktrees/fix/login-bug -b fix/login-bug
   ```
3. Copy .agents/ directory (so agents have access to plans, RCAs):
   ```bash
   cp -r .agents worktrees/feature/dark-mode/.agents
   cp -r .agents worktrees/fix/login-bug/.agents
   ```
4. Install deps:
   ```bash
   cd worktrees/feature/dark-mode && npm install
   cd worktrees/fix/login-bug && npm install
   ```
5. Register:
   ```bash
   .claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/register.sh feature/dark-mode worktrees/feature/dark-mode 8124 "Implement dark mode toggle"
   .claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/register.sh fix/login-bug worktrees/fix/login-bug 8125 "Fix login redirect bug"
   ```
6. Launch agents:
   ```bash
   .claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/launch-agent.sh worktrees/feature/dark-mode "Implement dark mode toggle"
   .claude/skills/worktree-agents/scripts/launch-agent.sh worktrees/fix/login-bug "Fix login redirect bug"
   ```
7. Report:
   ```
   Created 2 worktrees with agents:

   | Branch | Port | Task |
   |--------|------|------|
   | feature/dark-mode | 8124 | Implement dark mode toggle |
   | fix/login-bug | 8125 | Fix login redirect bug |

   Both agents are now running in separate Ghostty windows.
   .agents/ directory copied to each worktree.
   ```
