## STEP 1: Detect Previous Context

**Before asking any questions**, check if the conversation contains outputs from these previous skills:

### Ideal Context (All Present):
- **customer-persona-builder** → Target personas, buying journey stages
- **product-positioning-expert** → Positioning, messaging pillars, value props
- **brand-identity-designer** → Tone of voice, brand personality
- **go-to-market-planner** → Customer acquisition funnel
- **pricing-strategy-architect** → Pricing tiers, trial structure

### Partial Context (Some Present):
- Only **customer-persona-builder** + **product-positioning-expert**
- Only **brand-identity-designer** + **customer-persona-builder**
- Basic product/service description with target customer

### No Context:
- No previous skill outputs detected

---

## STEP 2: Context-Adaptive Introduction

### If IDEAL CONTEXT detected:
```
I found comprehensive context from previous analyses:

- **Target Personas**: [Quote top persona + buying journey]
- **Positioning**: [Quote key messaging]
- **Brand Voice**: [Quote tone attributes]
- **Customer Journey**: [Quote funnel stages from GTM plan]
- **Pricing Model**: [Quote trial/freemium structure]

I'll design an email marketing strategy that nurtures prospects through your funnel, activates trials, and retains customers using your brand voice and messaging.

Ready to begin?
```

### If PARTIAL CONTEXT detected:
```
I found partial context from previous analyses:

[Quote relevant details]

I have some context but need additional information about your customer journey, product onboarding, and email goals to design comprehensive email marketing.

Ready to proceed?
```

### If NO CONTEXT detected:
```
I'll help you build a comprehensive email marketing strategy.

We'll design:
- Email types (welcome, nurture, promotional, transactional, re-engagement)
- Drip campaigns (onboarding, trial conversion, post-purchase)
- Segmentation strategy (behavioral, demographic, lifecycle)
- Automation workflows (triggers, conditions, actions)
- Copywriting guidelines (subject lines, CTAs, structure)
- Success metrics (open rate, click rate, conversion)

First, I need to understand your product, customer journey, and email goals.

```

---

## STEP 5: Drip Campaign Design (One at a Time)

For each key drip campaign, ask these questions sequentially:

**Question DC1: [Campaign Name] - Onboarding Campaign**
```
Let's design your **Onboarding Campaign** (sent to new signups/trial users).

**Campaign Goal**: [What should users achieve? e.g., "Complete profile setup and create first project"]

**Campaign Duration**: [How long? e.g., "7 days" or "14 days"]

**Email Cadence**: [How often? e.g., "Day 0, Day 1, Day 3, Day 7"]

**Key Actions to Drive**:
1. [Action 1: e.g., "Complete profile"]
2. [Action 2: e.g., "Invite team member"]
3. [Action 3: e.g., "Create first project"]
4. [Action 4: e.g., "Complete tutorial"]

**Success Metric**: [What defines success? e.g., "40% of trial users complete onboarding within 3 days"]
```

**Question DC2: [Campaign Name] - Onboarding Email Flow**
```
For your **Onboarding Campaign**, how many emails and what's the sequence?

Example:
- **Email 1** (Day 0 - Immediately after signup): Welcome, set expectations, first action
- **Email 2** (Day 1 - 24 hours later): How-to guide, drive second action
- **Email 3** (Day 3): Social proof, case study, third action
- **Email 4** (Day 7): Check-in, offer help, final nudge

**Your Onboarding Email Sequence**:
- **Email 1** (Timing: [When]): [Purpose/Goal]
- **Email 2** (Timing: [When]): [Purpose/Goal]
- **Email 3** (Timing: [When]): [Purpose/Goal]
- **Email 4** (Timing: [When]): [Purpose/Goal]
[... up to 7 emails]
```

**Repeat DC1-DC2 for each key campaign:**
- Trial Conversion Campaign
- Engagement Campaign
- Winback Campaign
- Newsletter Program

---

## STEP 6: Segmentation Strategy

**Question SEG1: Segmentation Criteria**
```
How should you segment your email list?

**Demographic Segmentation**:
- Company size (1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 200+)
- Industry vertical
- Job title/role
- Geographic location

**Behavioral Segmentation**:
- Product usage (active, inactive, power users)
- Trial status (trial day 1, day 7, day 14)
- Feature adoption (using feature X, not using feature Y)
- Engagement level (opens emails, clicks, never opens)

**Lifecycle Segmentation**:
- Stage (lead, trial, customer, churned)
- Customer tier (free, starter, pro, enterprise)
- Tenure (new customer, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year)

**Which segmentation criteria matter most for your business?**

**Your Top 3 Segmentation Criteria**:
1. [Criterion 1]: [Why this matters]
2. [Criterion 2]: [Why]
3. [Criterion 3]: [Why]
```

**Question SEG2: Segment-Specific Messaging**
```
For your key segments, how should messaging differ?

**Segment 1**: [Name, e.g., "New Trial Users (Day 1-3)"]
- **Messaging Focus**: [e.g., "Onboarding, quick wins, reduce friction"]
- **Tone**: [e.g., "Encouraging, helpful, educational"]
- **Primary CTA**: [e.g., "Complete setup"]

**Segment 2**: [Name, e.g., "Active Customers (>6 months)"]
- **Messaging Focus**: [e.g., "Advanced features, upsells, loyalty"]
- **Tone**: [e.g., "Professional, value-focused"]
- **Primary CTA**: [e.g., "Upgrade tier"]

**Segment 3**: [Name, e.g., "Inactive Users (30+ days no login)"]
- **Messaging Focus**: [e.g., "Re-engagement, FOMO, new features"]
- **Tone**: [e.g., "Curious, value-reminder"]
- **Primary CTA**: [e.g., "See what's new"]

[Repeat for 3-5 key segments]
```

---

## STEP 7: Email Copywriting & Design

**Question COPY1: Subject Line Strategy**
```
What's your approach to subject lines?

**Subject Line Best Practices**:
- Length: 30-50 characters (mobile-friendly)
- Personalization: Include [First Name]?
- Urgency: Use time-sensitive language? ("Last chance", "Ending soon")
- Curiosity: Tease value without revealing all
- Clarity: Be direct about what's inside
- Emojis: Use sparingly? (depends on brand)

**Your Subject Line Approach**:
- **Style**: [Direct / Curious / Benefit-focused / Question-based]
- **Personalization**: [Yes / No / Sometimes]
- **Emojis**: [Yes / No / Rarely]
- **Testing**: [A/B test subject lines?]

**Example Subject Lines** (3-5):
1. [Subject line for welcome email]
2. [Subject line for trial conversion]
3. [Subject line for feature announcement]
4. [Subject line for winback campaign]
5. [Subject line for newsletter]
```

**Question COPY2: Email Structure**
```
What's your standard email structure?

**Recommended Structure**:
1. **Preheader** (50-100 chars, expands on subject line)
2. **Opening** (personalized greeting, set context)
3. **Body** (1-3 paragraphs max, skimmable)
4. **Value/Benefit** (what's in it for them)
5. **Social Proof** (optional: testimonial, stat, logo)
6. **CTA** (clear, single primary action)
7. **Signature** (from a person, not "The Team")
8. **P.S.** (optional: secondary CTA or reminder)

**Your Preferred Structure**:
[Describe your approach - long-form vs short, single CTA vs multiple, etc.]

**Paragraph Length**: [1-2 sentences / 3-4 sentences]
**CTA Style**: [Button / Link / Both]
**Images**: [Heavy imagery / Minimal / Text-only]
```

**Question COPY3: Call-to-Action Guidelines**
```
What's your CTA strategy?

**CTA Best Practices**:
- Action-oriented verbs ("Start", "Get", "Try", "Join")
- Benefit-focused ("Start Free Trial" vs "Sign Up")
- Create urgency ("Get Started Today" vs "Get Started")
- Single primary CTA (don't confuse with multiple options)
- Repeat CTA 2-3 times in longer emails

**Your CTA Examples** (by email type):
- **Welcome Email**: [CTA text]
- **Onboarding Email**: [CTA text]
- **Trial Conversion**: [CTA text]
- **Feature Announcement**: [CTA text]
- **Winback Email**: [CTA text]

**CTA Design**:
- **Button Color**: [Brand color]
- **Button Size**: [Large / Medium]

```

**Trigger-Based Workflows** (event → email sequence):

**Workflow 1**: [Name, e.g., "Trial Signup Workflow"]
- **Trigger**: [User signs up for trial]
- **Condition**: [Check if user has verified email]
- **Action**: [Send onboarding email sequence]
- **Goal**: [40% complete onboarding within 3 days]

**Workflow 2**: [Name, e.g., "Feature Adoption Workflow"]
- **Trigger**: [User creates first project]
- **Condition**: [Check if user hasn't invited team member]
- **Action**: [Send collaboration tutorial email]
- **Goal**: [30% invite team member within 7 days]

**Workflow 3**: [Name, e.g., "Inactivity Re-engagement"]
- **Trigger**: [User inactive for 14 days]
- **Condition**: [Check if paying customer or trial]
- **Action**: [Send winback email with incentive]
- **Goal**: [15% return to product within 7 days]

[Define 3-5 key automated workflows]
```

**Question AUTO2: Workflow Logic**
```
For your key workflows, what's the conditional logic?

**Example Workflow**: Trial Conversion (Day 10 of 14-day trial)

```
IF trial user
  AND has NOT upgraded to paid
  AND trial expires in 4 days
  AND has completed onboarding (activated)
THEN send "Trial Expiring - Special Offer" email
WAIT 2 days
IF still not upgraded
THEN send "Last Day - Don't Lose Access" email
```

**Your Workflow Logic** (for top workflow):
[Describe trigger, conditions, actions, wait times, fallback scenarios]
```

---

## STEP 9: Deliverability & Technical Setup

**Question DEL1: Sender Reputation**
```
What's your email deliverability setup?

**Sender Authentication**:

- [ ] DMARC policy set (protects against spoofing)
- [ ] Custom sending domain (emails from mail.yourdomain.com, not ESP)

**Current Status**: [Which are set up? Which need setup?]

**Sender Information**:
- **From Name**: [Who emails come from - person name or company?]
- **From Email**: [Email address - hello@, support@, firstname@]
- **Reply-To**: [Same as From or different?]
```

**Question DEL2: List Hygiene**
```
How will you maintain list health?

**List Hygiene Practices**:
- **Double Opt-In**: [Yes / No] - Require email confirmation?
- **Unsubscribe**: [One-click / Preference center]
- **Bounce Handling**: [Auto-remove hard bounces after X attempts]
- **Inactive Cleanup**: [Remove subscribers who haven't opened in X months?]
- **Spam Complaint Threshold**: [What's acceptable? Aim for <0.1%]

**Your List Hygiene Plan**:
[Describe approach]

**List Growth Goal**: [Target list size in 90 days]
**Current List Size**: [# subscribers]
**Expected Growth Rate**: [X subscribers/month]
```

---

## STEP 10: Success Metrics & Tracking

**Question METRICS1: Key Email Metrics**
```
What metrics will you track?

**Deliverability Metrics**:
- Delivery Rate: [Target >99%]

### Segmentation Logic

**Dynamic Segmentation** (segments update automatically based on behavior):

```
IF user signed_up_date < 3 days
  AND has_completed_onboarding = FALSE
THEN segment = "New Trial User - Not Activated"
  → Send Onboarding Campaign

IF user signed_up_date 4-14 days
  AND has_completed_onboarding = TRUE
  AND is_paying_customer = FALSE
THEN segment = "Activated Trial User"
  → Send Trial Conversion Campaign

IF user is_paying_customer = TRUE
  AND last_login < 30 days ago
  AND tenure > 6 months
THEN segment = "Active Customer - Established"
  → Send Retention + Upsell Campaign

IF user last_login > 30 days
  AND is_paying_customer = TRUE
THEN segment = "At-Risk Customer"
  → Send Winback Campaign
```

## 6. Email Copywriting Guidelines

### Subject Line Best Practices

**Subject Line Formula**:
[Personalization] + [Benefit/Curiosity] + [Urgency (optional)]

**Examples**:
- ✅ "[Name], your trial expires in 3 days" (Personalization + Urgency)
- ✅ "How [Company] increased revenue 40% with [Product]" (Social proof + Benefit)
- ✅ "Are you making this [mistake]?" (Curiosity + Fear of loss)
- ❌ "Newsletter #47" (Generic, no value)
- ❌ "Important update" (Vague, no context)

**Subject Line Guidelines**:
- **Length**: 30-50 characters (mobile-friendly)
- **Personalization**: Use [FirstName] sparingly (don't overuse)
- **Urgency**: Use honestly (don't fake scarcity)
- **Punctuation**: Question marks OK, exclamation points rarely
- **Numbers**: Include specific numbers when relevant ("3 tips", "40% increase")
- **Emojis**: [Use / Don't use / Use sparingly] based on brand

**A/B Testing**:
Test subject lines every send. Test variables:
- Short vs long
- Question vs statement
- Benefit vs curiosity
- Emoji vs no emoji
- Personalization vs generic

**Winning Subject Lines from Your Industry** (benchmark):
- [Example 1]: [X% open rate]
- [Example 2]: [Y% open rate]
- [Example 3]: [Z% open rate]

---

### Email Body Copywriting

**Email Structure** (standard template):

```
[Preheader Text] (50-100 characters - expands on subject line)

Hi [FirstName],

[Opening paragraph] (1-2 sentences - set context)
Why you're receiving this email, what's in it for them.

[Body paragraph 1] (2-3 sentences - value/education)
Teach something useful, share insight, provide context.

[Body paragraph 2] (2-3 sentences - benefit/outcome)
What they'll achieve, social proof, specific result.

[CTA] (clear, single primary action)
[Button: "Action-Oriented Text"]

[Closing] (1 sentence - reduce friction)
"Questions? Just reply to this email."

[Signature]
[Name]
[Title]

P.S. [Optional - secondary message or reminder]
```

**Copywriting Principles**:
1. **One Email = One Goal**: Don't try to accomplish multiple objectives
2. **Clarity > Cleverness**: Be direct, avoid wordplay that confuses
3. **Benefit-Focused**: Lead with "what's in it for them", not "we launched X"
4. **Conversational Tone**: Write like you're emailing a friend (while maintaining professionalism)
5. **Scannability**: Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences), use bullets, bold key phrases
6. **Active Voice**: "We help you achieve X" not "X can be achieved by you"
7. **Specificity**: "Save 10 hours/week" not "Save time"
8. **Proof**: Back claims with data, testimonials, case studies

**Writing Don'ts**:
- ❌ Don't use jargon or unexplained acronyms
- ❌ Don't write long paragraphs (>4 sentences)
- ❌ Don't bury the CTA at the bottom
- ❌ Don't include multiple competing CTAs
- ❌ Don't use passive voice
- ❌ Don't write "We're excited to announce..." (focus on customer benefit)

---

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Guidelines

**CTA Formula**:
[Action Verb] + [Specific Outcome] + [Urgency/Benefit (optional)]

**CTA Examples by Email Type**:

**Welcome Email**:
- ✅ "Complete Your Setup" (action + outcome)
- ✅ "Get Started in 5 Minutes" (action + time benefit)
- ❌ "Click Here" (vague)

**Trial Conversion**:
- ✅ "Upgrade to Keep Access" (action + benefit)
- ✅ "Start Your Paid Plan" (action + outcome)
- ❌ "Buy Now" (transactional, no benefit)

**Feature Announcement**:
- ✅ "Try [Feature] Now" (action + specific)
- ✅ "See How It Works" (action + curiosity)
- ❌ "Learn More" (generic, no specificity)

**Winback Email**:
- ✅ "See What You've Missed" (curiosity + FOMO)
- ✅ "Claim Your Special Offer" (action + value)
- ❌ "Log In" (action without benefit)

**CTA Placement**:
- Primary CTA: Above the fold (visible without scrolling)
- Repeat CTA: 2-3 times in email (beginning, middle, end)
- Secondary CTA: Link in P.S. or footer

**CTA Button Design**:
- **Color**: [Brand primary or accent color with high contrast]
- **Size**: Large enough to tap on mobile (44×44px minimum)
- **Text**: [Sentence case / Title Case] - be consistent
- **Surrounding Space**: Plenty of white space so CTA stands out

---

### Tone of Voice (from Brand Guidelines)

[If brand-identity-designer output exists, quote tone of voice guidelines]

**Tone Attributes**:
- [Attribute 1]: [Example]
- [Attribute 2]: [Example]
- [Attribute 3]: [Example]

**Tone by Email Type**:
- **Transactional**: [Clear, helpful, functional]
- **Onboarding**: [Encouraging, educational, supportive]
- **Promotional**: [Exciting, benefit-focused, urgent]
- **Customer Success**: [Professional, partnership-oriented, appreciative]
- **Winback**: [Curious, non-pushy, value-reminder]

## 8. Deliverability Best Practices

### Sender Authentication

**DNS Records to Configure**:

**SPF Record** (Sender Policy Framework):
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.youresp.com ~all
```
- Authenticates your domain
- Prevents spoofing
- **Status**: [Configured / Needs setup]

**DKIM Signature** (DomainKeys Identified Mail):
```
[Generated by your ESP]
```
- Verifies email integrity
- Adds digital signature
- **Status**: [Configured / Needs setup]

**DMARC Policy** (Domain-based Message Authentication):
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@yourdomain.com
```
- Protects against phishing
- Provides reports on authentication failures
- **Status**: [Configured / Needs setup]

**Custom Sending Domain**:
- Use: mail.yourdomain.com (not ESP's shared domain)
- Improves deliverability and brand trust
- **Status**: [Configured / Needs setup]

---

### Sender Information

**From Name**: [Person name or Company name]
- Recommendation: Use person name for higher open rates (feels personal)
- Example: "Sarah from [Company]" vs "[Company] Team"

**From Email**: [firstname@yourdomain.com]
- Use real email that accepts replies
- Don't use noreply@ (reduces deliverability and trust)

**Reply-To**: [Same as From or support@yourdomain.com]
- Make it easy for recipients to reach you

---

### List Hygiene

**Double Opt-In**: [Recommended: YES]
- Require email confirmation after signup
- Reduces spam complaints and fake emails
- Improves engagement metrics (only engaged subscribers)

**Unsubscribe Process**:
- One-click unsubscribe (required by law)
- Preference center (let users choose email types/frequency)
- Don't make it hard to unsubscribe (hurts deliverability)

**Bounce Handling**:
- Hard bounces: Remove immediately (invalid email)
- Soft bounces: Retry 3x, then remove (temporary issues)
- Target: <2% bounce rate

**Inactive Subscriber Management**:
- Sunset policy: Remove subscribers who haven't opened in 6-12 months
- Send re-engagement campaign first ("Do you still want to hear from us?")
- Better to have small engaged list than large unengaged list

**Spam Complaint Management**:
- Target: <0.1% spam complaint rate
- Monitor feedback loops from ISPs
- Remove complainers immediately
- If rate exceeds 0.2%, pause and investigate

---

### Content Best Practices

**Spam Trigger Words to Avoid**:
- ❌ "FREE!!!", "Act now!", "Limited time!", "Click here!"
- ❌ ALL CAPS SUBJECT LINES
- ❌ Excessive exclamation marks!!!!
- ✅ Use benefit-focused language instead

**HTML Email Best Practices**:
- Keep HTML simple (avoid complex tables)
- Include text version (required by law, improves deliverability)
- Optimize image-to-text ratio (60% text, 40% images)
- Don't use image-only emails (flagged as spam)
- Keep email width <600px (mobile-friendly)

**Link Best Practices**:
- Don't use URL shorteners (looks spammy)
- Use descriptive link text ("Read the guide" vs "Click here")
- Limit number of links (<10 per email)
- Test links before sending

---

### Sending Best Practices

**Send Time Optimization**:
- **B2B SaaS**: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am or 1-3pm (recipient's timezone)
- **B2C**: Evenings and weekends often perform better
- **Test your audience**: A/B test send times

**Send Frequency**:
- Start slow: 1-2 emails/week
- Monitor engagement: If open rates drop, reduce frequency
- Segment by engagement: Send more to engaged, less to unengaged

**List Warming** (for new sending domains):
- Day 1: Send to 50 most engaged subscribers
- Day 3: Send to 200
- Day 7: Send to 1,000
- Day 14: Send to 5,000
- Day 30: Send to full list
- Gradually increase volume to build sender reputation

**1. Welcome Email is #1 Priority**
Highest open rate (50-60%) of any email. Set expectations, drive first action, start relationship right.

**2. Drip > Batch**
Behavior-triggered drip campaigns (onboarding, trial conversion) convert 5-10x better than batch newsletters.

**3. Segment Ruthlessly**
Sending same email to trial users and 2-year customers is lazy and ineffective. Segment by lifecycle and behavior.

**4. One Email = One Goal**
Don't ask people to do 5 things. One clear CTA per email.

**5. Deliverability First**
Set up SPF/DKIM/DMARC, use custom sending domain, maintain list hygiene. Best copy doesn't matter if it hits spam.

**6. Test Subject Lines Always**
50% of email success is getting opened. A/B test every send.

**7. Automate Everything Trigger-Based**
If it's triggered by user behavior (signup, trial day 10, inactive 30 days), automate it. Don't manually send.

**8. Measure What Matters**
Open rate is vanity. Trial conversion, activation rate, revenue per email - those are success metrics.
