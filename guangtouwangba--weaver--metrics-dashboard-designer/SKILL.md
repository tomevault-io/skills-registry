## STEP 1: Detect Previous Context

### Ideal Context (All Present):
- **revenue-model-builder** → Revenue streams, unit economics, CAC, LTV
- **customer-persona-builder** → User segments for cohort analysis
- **product-positioning-expert** → Value metrics, success indicators
- **growth-hacking-playbook** → AARRR framework, North Star Metric
- **go-to-market-planner** → GTM metrics, channel performance

### Partial Context (Some Present):
- **revenue-model-builder** → Business metrics available
- **growth-hacking-playbook** → Growth metrics framework available
- **customer-persona-builder** → User segmentation available

### No Context:
- None of the above skills were run

---

## STEP 2: Context-Adaptive Introduction

### If Ideal Context:
> I found outputs from **revenue-model-builder**, **customer-persona-builder**, **product-positioning-expert**, **growth-hacking-playbook**, and **go-to-market-planner**.
>
> I can reuse:
> - **Revenue streams & unit economics** (CAC: [X], LTV: [Y], target margins)
> - **User segments** (for cohort analysis & segmentation)
> - **Value metrics** (core success indicators)
> - **AARRR framework** (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue)
> - **GTM metrics** (channel performance, conversion rates)
>
> **Proceed with this data?** [Yes/Start Fresh]

### If Partial Context:
> I found outputs from some upstream skills: [list which ones].
>
> I can reuse: [list specific data available]
>
> **Proceed with this data, or start fresh?**

### If No Context:
> No previous context detected.
>
> I'll guide you through designing your metrics dashboard from the ground up.

## STEP 3: Questions (One at a Time, Sequential)

### North Star Metric

**Question NSM1: What is your North Star Metric?**

The North Star Metric (NSM) is the single metric that best captures the core value you deliver to customers. It should be:
- **Leading indicator** of sustainable growth
- **Aligned** with customer value and business value
- **Actionable** by the team

**Examples**:
- **Slack**: Messages sent per day
- **Airbnb**: Nights booked
- **Spotify**: Time spent listening
- **Notion**: Weekly active users who create content

**Your North Star Metric**: [e.g., "Monthly Active Projects Created"]

**Why this metric?**: [What customer value does it represent?]

---

**Question NSM2: What is the current baseline and target for your NSM?**

**Current Baseline**: [e.g., "1,200 monthly active projects"]
**3-Month Target**: [e.g., "2,500 monthly active projects"]
**12-Month Target**: [e.g., "10,000 monthly active projects"]

**Key Drivers**: [What 2-3 metrics drive your NSM? e.g., "New user signups, activation rate, returning user rate"]

---

### AARRR Metrics (Pirate Metrics)

**Question AARRR1: ACQUISITION - How do you measure user acquisition?**

**Primary Acquisition Metrics** (choose 3-5):
- ☐ Website visitors (unique, sessions)
- ☐ Signups (total, by channel)
- ☐ App installs (iOS, Android)

- ☐ Demo requests
- ☐ Trial starts
- ☐ Other: [specify]

**Your Top 3 Acquisition Metrics**:
1. [Metric name] — Current: [X], Target: [Y]
2. [Metric name] — Current: [X], Target: [Y]
3. [Metric name] — Current: [X], Target: [Y]

**By Channel Breakdown**:
- Organic Search: [X%]
- Paid Search: [X%]
- Social Media: [X%]
- Referral: [X%]
- Direct: [X%]
- Other: [X%]

---

**Question AARRR2: ACTIVATION - How do you measure user activation?**

**Activation Definition**: What must a user do to experience the "aha moment"?

**Examples**:
- Facebook: "Add 7 friends in 10 days"

**Cohort Retention**:
- Track cohorts by signup month
- Measure: What % of January signups are still active in February, March, etc.?

**Retention Curve**:
- **Current D30 Retention**: [e.g., "35%"]
- **Target D30 Retention**: [e.g., "50%"]
- **Best-in-Class Benchmark**: [e.g., "60% for productivity SaaS"]

**Churn Metrics**:
- **User Churn Rate**: [X% per month]
- **Revenue Churn Rate**: [X% MRR per month]
- **Negative Churn?**: [Yes/No — do expansions offset churn?]

---

**Question AARRR4: REFERRAL - How do you measure referral and virality?**

**Referral Metrics**:

- **Invites Sent per User**: [e.g., "2.3 invites/user"]
- **Invite Acceptance Rate**: [e.g., "22% of invites convert to signups"]
- **Viral Coefficient (K)**: [e.g., "0.35" — (2.3 invites × 0.15 referral rate)]

**K-Factor Goal**:
- **K < 1**: Sub-viral (growth requires paid acquisition)
- **K = 1**: Self-sustaining (each user brings one more)
- **K > 1**: Viral growth (exponential growth)

**Your K-Factor**: [Current K]
**Target K-Factor**: [Target K]

## STEP 7: Generate Comprehensive Metrics Dashboard Strategy

**You will now receive a comprehensive document covering**:

### Section 1: Executive Summary
- North Star Metric and why it was chosen
- Dashboard strategy overview (5 dashboards)
- Key targets and baseline performance

### Section 2: AARRR Framework Deep Dive
- **Acquisition**: Top 3 metrics, channel breakdown, targets

### Section 3: Dashboard Architecture
- **Dashboard 1: Executive Dashboard** (purpose, metrics, visualizations, refresh frequency)
- **Dashboard 2: Growth Dashboard** (acquisition funnel, channel performance)
- **Dashboard 3: Product Dashboard** (engagement, feature adoption, session metrics)
- **Dashboard 4: Revenue Dashboard** (MRR waterfall, cohort LTV, churn)
- **Dashboard 5: Retention Dashboard** (retention curves, at-risk users, NPS)

### Section 4: Alerts & Monitoring
- Alert rules (metric, threshold, channel, owner)
- Review cadence (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Escalation paths for critical issues

### Section 5: Data Infrastructure
- Data sources (product DB, analytics, payment processor, CRM, support, marketing)
- Data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, or None)
- ETL/ELT pipeline (Fivetran, Stitch, Airbyte, custom)

### Section 6: Metric Definitions (Data Dictionary)
| Metric Name | Definition | Calculation | Data Source | Owner | Target |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| North Star Metric | [full definition] | [formula] | [source] | [person] | [target] |
| MRR | Monthly Recurring Revenue | Sum of active subscriptions | Stripe | Finance | $X |
| [etc. for 20-30 key metrics] | | | | | |

### Section 7: Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3)**: Event tracking audit, metric definitions, core dashboard
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6)**: Role-specific dashboards (growth, product, revenue)
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-12)**: Alerts, data quality, team training

### Section 8: Success Criteria
- Dashboard adoption (X% of team uses dashboards weekly)
- Data-driven decisions (X% of product decisions cite dashboard metrics)
- Metric improvement (NSM grows X%, activation rate improves Y%, churn decreases Z%)

### Section 9: Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Vanity metrics (page views, signups) vs. actionable metrics (activation rate, retention)
- Too many metrics (dashboard overload)
- No ownership (every metric needs an owner)
- Ignoring data quality (garbage in, garbage out)
- Building dashboards in a vacuum (get team input)

### Section 10: Next Steps
- Share dashboard with team
- Schedule weekly metric review meetings
- Integrate with **retention-optimization-expert** (use retention data to reduce churn)
- Integrate with **onboarding-flow-optimizer** (use activation metrics to improve onboarding)

---

## STEP 8: Quality Review & Iteration

After generating the strategy, I will ask:

**Quality Check**:
1. Does the North Star Metric align with core customer value?
2. Are AARRR metrics complete and measurable?
3. Are dashboard roles clear (who uses which dashboard)?
4. Are targets realistic and time-bound?
5. Is the data infrastructure plan feasible?
6. Is the implementation roadmap broken into actionable sprints?

**Iterate?** [Yes — refine X / No — finalize]

---

## STEP 9: Save & Next Steps

Once finalized, I will:
1. **Save** the metrics dashboard strategy to your project folder
2. **Suggest** running **retention-optimization-expert** next (to act on retention data)
3. **Remind** you to schedule a weekly metrics review meeting with your team

---

## 8 Critical Guidelines for This Skill

1. **North Star Metric must be leading, not lagging**: Choose a metric that predicts growth (e.g., "Projects created") over a vanity metric (e.g., "Signups").

2. **AARRR metrics must be complete**: Don't skip Referral or Revenue just because they're hard to track. Every business has all 5 stages.

3. **Dashboards must match roles**: Don't build one giant dashboard for everyone. Build 5 focused dashboards for different teams.

4. **Targets must be realistic**: Use industry benchmarks (e.g., SaaS D30 retention: 30-50%, DAU/MAU: 20%+, LTV:CAC: 3:1).

5. **Data quality is non-negotiable**: No dashboard is better than a dashboard with wrong data. Invest in data quality from Day 1.

6. **Every metric needs an owner**: Assign ownership for each metric. If no one owns it, it won't improve.

7. **Alerts prevent fire drills**: Set up automated alerts for critical metrics (NSM, MRR, churn, uptime). Don't rely on manual checks.

8. **Adoption > features**: A simple dashboard that everyone uses beats a complex dashboard that no one understands. Prioritize clarity and adoption.

## HTML Editorial Template Reference

**CRITICAL**: When generating HTML output, you MUST read and follow the skeleton template files AND the verification checklist to maintain StratArts brand consistency.

### Template Files to Read (IN ORDER)

1. **Verification Checklist** (MUST READ FIRST):
   ```
   html-templates/VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md
   ```

2. **Base Template** (shared structure):
   ```
   html-templates/base-template.html
   ```

3. **Skill-Specific Template** (content sections & charts):
   ```
   html-templates/metrics-dashboard-designer.html
   ```

### How to Use Templates

1. Read `VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md` first - contains canonical CSS patterns that MUST be copied exactly
2. Read `base-template.html` - contains all shared CSS, layout structure, and Chart.js configuration
3. Read `metrics-dashboard-designer.html` - contains skill-specific content sections, CSS extensions, and chart scripts
4. Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers with actual analysis data
5. Merge the skill-specific CSS into `{{SKILL_SPECIFIC_CSS}}`
6. Merge the content sections into `{{CONTENT_SECTIONS}}`
7. Merge the chart scripts into `{{CHART_SCRIPTS}}`
