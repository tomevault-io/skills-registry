## STEP 1: Detect Previous Context

### Ideal Context (All Present):
- **metrics-dashboard-designer** → Activation metrics, D1/D7 retention, time-to-activate
- **customer-persona-builder** → User segments, goals, pain points, skill levels
- **product-positioning-expert** → Value proposition, key features, success indicators
- **retention-optimization-expert** → Early churn data, D1-D7 retention by cohort

### Partial Context (Some Present):
- **metrics-dashboard-designer** → Activation metrics available
- **customer-persona-builder** → User segmentation available
- **product-positioning-expert** → Value proposition available

### No Context:
- None of the above skills were run

---

## STEP 2: Context-Adaptive Introduction

### If Ideal Context:
> I found outputs from **metrics-dashboard-designer**, **customer-persona-builder**, **product-positioning-expert**, and **retention-optimization-expert**.
>
> I can reuse:
> - **Activation metrics** (current activation rate: [X%], time-to-activate: [Y hours])
> - **User segments** ([Segment A], [Segment B] with different onboarding needs)
> - **Value proposition** (core value: [X], key features: [Y, Z])
> - **Early retention data** (D1 retention: [X%], D7 retention: [Y%])
>
> **Proceed with this data?** [Yes/Start Fresh]

### If Partial Context:
> I found outputs from some upstream skills: [list which ones].
>
> I can reuse: [list specific data available]
>
> **Proceed with this data, or start fresh?**

### If No Context:
> No previous context detected.
>
> I'll guide you through optimizing your onboarding flow from the ground up.

## STEP 3: Questions (One at a Time, Sequential)

### Activation Definition & Current Performance

**Question AD1: How do you define user activation?**

**Activation = "Aha Moment"** (the moment a user experiences the core value of your product)

**Examples**:
- **Slack**: "Send 2,000 team messages"
- **Dropbox**: "Upload and share first file"
- **Facebook**: "Add 7 friends in 10 days"
- **Canva**: "Create and download first design"
- **Notion**: "Create first page and add content"
- **Airbnb**: "Complete first booking"

**Your Activation Event**: [e.g., "Create first project with 3+ tasks and invite 1 team member"]

**Why this event?**: [What value does the user experience at this moment?]

**Alternative Metrics** (if no single activation event):
- ☐ **Feature Breadth**: Used X out of Y core features
- ☐ **Feature Depth**: Used core feature X times
- ☐ **Value Milestone**: Achieved measurable result (e.g., "Sent first invoice", "Published first blog post")

---

**Question AD2: What is your current activation performance?**

**Activation Metrics**:
- **Activation Rate**: [e.g., "42% of signups complete activation within 7 days"]
- **Time to Activate**: [e.g., "Median time: 12 hours from signup"]
- **Activation by Cohort**: [e.g., "January: 38%, February: 42%, March: 45%" — improving?]
- **Activation by Segment**:
  - [Segment A]: [X%]
  - [Segment B]: [X%]
  - [Segment C]: [X%]

**Activation Funnel** (signup → onboarding steps → activation):

| Step                          | Users | Conversion | Drop-off |
|-------------------------------|-------|------------|----------|
| 1. Signup completed           | 1,000 | 100%       | —        |
| 2. Email verified             | 850   | 85%        | 15%      |
| 3. Profile completed          | 680   | 68%        | 17%      |
| 4. First action taken         | 510   | 51%        | 17%      |
| 5. **Activated** (aha moment) | 420   | **42%**    | 9%       |

**Where is the biggest drop-off?**: [Which step?]

**Industry Benchmarks** (for context):
- **B2B SaaS**: Activation rate 30-50%
- **Consumer Apps**: Activation rate 20-40%
- **Productivity Tools**: Activation rate 40-60%

**Your Performance vs. Benchmark**:
- Current Activation Rate: [X%]
- Benchmark: [Y%]
- Gap: [Z percentage points]

**Target Activation Rate**: [e.g., "60% within 90 days"]

---

### Onboarding Friction Analysis

**Question FA1: Where do users get stuck during onboarding?**

**Drop-off Point Analysis** (from funnel above):

| Step                     | Drop-off | Why are users dropping off?                          | How to fix?                                  |
|--------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Signup → Email Verified  | 15%      | [e.g., "Didn't receive email, went to spam"]         | [e.g., "Improve email deliverability"]       |
| Email → Profile Complete | 17%      | [e.g., "Too many fields, friction"]                  | [e.g., "Reduce required fields to 3"]        |
| Profile → First Action   | 17%      | [e.g., "Don't know what to do next"]                 | [e.g., "Add onboarding checklist"]           |
| First Action → Activated | 9%       | [e.g., "Core feature too complicated"]               | [e.g., "Add interactive product tour"]       |

**Top 3 Friction Points**:
1. [Friction Point 1] — [Impact: X% drop-off] — [Solution]
2. [Friction Point 2] — [Impact: X% drop-off] — [Solution]
3. [Friction Point 3] — [Impact: X% drop-off] — [Solution]

---

**Question FA2: How long does it take users to activate?**

**Time-to-Activate Distribution**:
- **<1 hour**: [X%] (fast activators — ideal)
- **1-24 hours**: [X%] (same-day activators)
- **1-7 days**: [X%] (slow activators)
- **7+ days**: [X%] (very slow, likely won't activate)

**Median Time-to-Activate**: [e.g., "12 hours"]
**Target Time-to-Activate**: [e.g., "<1 hour for 50% of users"]

**What delays activation?**:
- ☐ Waiting for team members to join
- ☐ Waiting for data import to complete
- ☐ Learning curve (too complicated, need tutorials)
- ☐ Missing information (need to gather data before using product)
- ☐ Technical issues (bugs, slow load times)
- ☐ Other: [specify]

**How to reduce time-to-activate**:
1. [Action 1] — e.g., "Allow users to skip team invites and activate solo first"
2. [Action 2] — e.g., "Provide sample data so users can explore without importing"
3. [Action 3] — e.g., "Add quick-start video (2 minutes) to speed learning"

---

### Onboarding Checklist Design

**Question OC1: What is your onboarding checklist?**

**Onboarding Checklist** = A clear, step-by-step guide to activation

**Best Practices**:
- **3-5 steps** (not 10+)
- **Specific, actionable** ("Create your first project", not "Explore features")
- **Trackable progress** (show "2 of 4 completed")
- **Celebration on completion** (confetti, badge, email)

**Your Onboarding Checklist**:

✅ **Step 1**: [e.g., "Complete your profile (name, company, role)"]
- Why it matters: [e.g., "Personalizes your experience"]
- Time to complete: [e.g., "30 seconds"]

✅ **Step 2**: [e.g., "Create your first project"]
- Why it matters: [e.g., "This is where you'll organize your work"]
- Time to complete: [e.g., "1 minute"]

✅ **Step 3**: [e.g., "Add 3 tasks to your project"]
- Why it matters: [e.g., "Experience how easy task management is"]
- Time to complete: [e.g., "2 minutes"]

✅ **Step 4**: [e.g., "Invite 1 team member" or "Connect your calendar"]
- Why it matters: [e.g., "Collaborate with your team" or "Sync your workflow"]
- Time to complete: [e.g., "1 minute"]

✅ **Step 5**: [e.g., "Mark your first task as complete"]
- Why it matters: [e.g., "Feel the satisfaction of progress"]
- Time to complete: [e.g., "10 seconds"]

**Total Time to Complete Checklist**: [e.g., "5 minutes"]
**Completion = Activation?**: [Yes/No — does completing checklist = activation event?]

---

**Question OC2: How do you incentivize checklist completion?**

**Incentive Strategies**:

1. **Progress Bar** (visual progress indicator)
   - "You're 60% done! Just 2 more steps"
   - Visual: ▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░ (6/10 complete)

2. **Gamification** (points, badges, streaks)
   - "Complete onboarding to unlock power features"
   - "Earn your 'Getting Started' badge"

3. **Social Proof** (show what others did)
   - "95% of successful teams complete all 5 steps"
   - "Top users completed onboarding in under 5 minutes"

4. **Reward on Completion** (unlock feature, give credits, send swag)
   - "Complete onboarding to get 100 free credits"
   - "Finish setup and we'll mail you a T-shirt"

5. **Email Nudges** (reminder emails for incomplete steps)
   - Day 1: "You're 2 steps away from full setup"
   - Day 3: "Just 1 step left! Finish now"

**Your Incentive Strategy** (choose 2-3):
1. [Incentive 1] — e.g., "Progress bar with % complete"
2. [Incentive 2] — e.g., "Unlock power feature after completing checklist"
3. [Incentive 3] — e.g., "Email nudge on Day 1 and Day 3"

---

### Product Tour Design

**Question PT1: Do you need a product tour?**

**Product Tour** = Interactive walkthrough that guides users through key features

**When to use product tours**:
- ☐ Your product is complex (many features, steep learning curve)
- ☐ First-time users don't know where to start
- ☐ Activation requires using specific features in sequence
- ☐ You have multiple user personas with different use cases

**When NOT to use product tours**:
- ☐ Your product is self-explanatory (e.g., Google search)
- ☐ Users are experienced (e.g., developers, power users)
- ☐ Tour would interrupt critical workflows

**Do you need a product tour?**: [Yes/No]

**If Yes**: [Type of tour — full tour, feature-specific tour, or persona-based tour]

---

**Question PT2: What does your product tour cover?**

**Product Tour Structure** (3-7 steps):

**Step 1**: **Welcome & Goal**
- Message: [e.g., "Welcome to [Product]! Let's get you set up in 2 minutes"]
- Goal: [e.g., "By the end, you'll have created your first project"]

**Step 2**: **Core Feature 1**
- Highlight: [e.g., "Project Dashboard — this is your command center"]
- Action: [e.g., "Click 'New Project' to get started"]
- Tooltip: [e.g., "All your projects will appear here"]

**Step 3**: **Core Feature 2**
- Highlight: [e.g., "Task List — add tasks to your project"]
- Action: [e.g., "Click 'Add Task' and type your first task"]
- Tooltip: [e.g., "Tasks can be assigned, prioritized, and tracked"]

**Step 4**: **Core Feature 3**
- Highlight: [e.g., "Collaboration — invite your team"]
- Action: [e.g., "Click 'Invite' and add your teammates"]
- Tooltip: [e.g., "Everyone can see updates in real-time"]

**Step 5**: **Power Feature** (optional)
- Highlight: [e.g., "Automation — save time with smart rules"]
- Action: [e.g., "Try creating your first automation"]
- Tooltip: [e.g., "Auto-assign tasks, send reminders, and more"]

**Step 6**: **Completion & Next Steps**
- Message: [e.g., "You're all set! Now go create something amazing"]
- CTA: [e.g., "Explore on your own" or "Start your first project"]

**Tour Format**:
- ☐ **Tooltip Tour** (tooltips appear over UI elements, user clicks through)
- ☐ **Modal Tour** (modal dialogs guide user step-by-step)
- ☐ **Video Tour** (2-minute video walkthrough)
- ☐ **Interactive Demo** (sandbox environment to practice without consequences)

**Your Tour Format**: [Choose 1-2]

**Can users skip the tour?**: [Yes/No — forced tour or optional?]
- Best practice: Always allow skipping, but track skip rate (high skip rate = tour isn't valuable)

---

2. **Empty States** (helpful messages when there's no data yet)
   - Example: "No projects yet. Let's create your first one!"
   - CTA: [e.g., "Create Project" button]

3. **Help Docs** (knowledge base, FAQs, tutorials)
   - Organized by: Getting Started, Core Features, Advanced Features, Troubleshooting
   - Format: Text + screenshots, or video tutorials

4. **Quick-Start Video** (2-3 minute overview)
   - Shows: Core workflow from start to finish
   - Hosted: Embedded in app (YouTube, Vimeo, Loom)

5. **Webinars / Live Onboarding Calls** (for high-touch customers)
   - Frequency: [e.g., "Weekly live onboarding session, or 1-on-1 call for enterprise"]
   - Who leads: CSM, Product Specialist, or Founder

6. **In-App Messages** (contextual nudges at key moments)
   - Example: "Try adding a due date to your task to set a deadline"
   - Trigger: User creates task without due date

**Your Educational Content** (choose 3-5):
1. [Content Type 1] — e.g., "Tooltips for all core features"
2. [Content Type 2] — e.g., "Quick-start video (2 minutes)"

## STEP 4: Generate Comprehensive Onboarding Optimization Strategy

**You will now receive a comprehensive document covering**:

### Section 1: Executive Summary
- Activation definition (aha moment: [X])
- Current activation rate and target (X% → Y%)
- Time-to-activate (current: [X], target: [Y])
- Top 3 friction points and solutions

### Section 2: Activation Funnel Analysis
- Activation funnel (signup → email → profile → first action → activated)
- Drop-off analysis (where users get stuck, why, how to fix)
- Activation by segment (persona, acquisition source, cohort)
- Industry benchmarks and performance gap

### Section 3: Onboarding Checklist Design
- 3-5 step checklist with time estimates
- Progress indicators and completion incentives
- Gamification and social proof strategies
- Email nudges for incomplete steps

### Section 4: Product Tour Design
- 5-step product tour (welcome, core features, completion)
- Tour format (tooltip, modal, video, interactive demo)
- Skip option and tracking (completion rate, skip rate)

### Section 5: Educational Content Strategy
- Tooltips for core features
- Empty states with CTAs
- Quick-start video (2-3 minutes)
- Help docs (Getting Started, FAQs, Troubleshooting)
- In-app messages for key moments
- Webinars / live onboarding (for high-touch customers)

### Section 6: Personalized Onboarding Paths
- Segmentation strategy (role, company size, use case, experience level)
- 2-3 persona-specific onboarding paths
- Personalized checklists, tours, and resources

### Section 7: Email Onboarding Sequence
- 5-email sequence (Day 0, 1, 3, 5, 7)
- Email content (subject, body, CTA)
- Triggers and segmentation (all users vs. non-activated users)

### Section 8: A/B Testing Plan
- 3 A/B tests (checklist length, product tour, incentives)
- Success metrics (activation rate, time-to-activate, completion rate)
- Testing cadence (one test every 2 weeks)

### Section 9: Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3)**: Activation definition, onboarding checklist, email sequence
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6)**: Product tour, tooltips, help resources
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-12)**: Personalization, A/B testing, continuous optimization

### Section 10: Success Metrics
- Activation Rate: [Baseline → Target — e.g., 42% → 60%]
- Time-to-Activate: [Baseline → Target — e.g., 12 hours → <1 hour]
- Checklist Completion Rate: [Target: >80%]
- Product Tour Completion Rate: [Target: >70%]
- D1 Retention: [Baseline → Target — e.g., 55% → 70%]
- D7 Retention: [Baseline → Target — e.g., 40% → 55%]

### Section 11: Next Steps
- Launch onboarding checklist this week
- Schedule weekly onboarding optimization meetings
- Integrate with **retention-optimization-expert** (early retention data feeds churn analysis)
- Integrate with **customer-feedback-framework** (gather onboarding feedback via surveys)

## STEP 5: Quality Review & Iteration

After generating the strategy, I will ask:

**Quality Check**:
1. Is the activation definition clear and measurable?
2. Does the onboarding checklist reduce time-to-value?
3. Are drop-off points addressed with specific solutions?
4. Is the product tour helpful without being intrusive?
5. Are personalized onboarding paths feasible to build?
6. Are A/B tests designed to optimize activation rate?

**Iterate?** [Yes — refine X / No — finalize]

---

## STEP 6: Save & Next Steps

Once finalized, I will:
1. **Save** the onboarding optimization strategy to your project folder
2. **Suggest** running **customer-feedback-framework** next (to gather feedback on onboarding)
3. **Remind** you to launch the onboarding checklist this week

## 8 Critical Guidelines for This Skill

1. **Activation = Aha Moment**: Define activation as the moment users experience core value, not arbitrary milestones (e.g., "Send 2,000 messages" > "Complete profile").

2. **Reduce time-to-value**: The faster users reach the aha moment, the better. Target <1 hour for 50% of users.

3. **3-5 step checklist, not 10+**: Long checklists overwhelm users. Keep it short and actionable.

4. **Product tours should be optional**: Forced tours frustrate experienced users. Always allow skipping, but track skip rate.

5. **Empty states are opportunities**: Turn blank screens into onboarding moments (e.g., "No projects yet. Let's create your first one!").

6. **Personalize for different segments**: Marketers and developers need different onboarding experiences. Segment by role, use case, or experience level.

7. **Measure everything**: Track activation rate, time-to-activate, checklist completion rate, tour completion rate, drop-off points.

8. **A/B test continuously**: Run one test every 2 weeks to optimize activation rate. Small improvements compound.
