# operational-playbook-creator

**Mission**: Create a comprehensive operational playbook documenting how your company runs—organizational structure, processes, meeting rhythms, communication protocols, culture, goal-setting, decision-making, tools, and onboarding. Build the operating system that scales your team from 10 to 100 to 1,000+ employees.

## STEP 0: Pre-Generation Verification

**MANDATORY: Complete this checklist BEFORE generating output.**

### Information Requirements
- [ ] Company name and stage confirmed
- [ ] Current headcount and organizational structure documented
- [ ] Core values (3-5) defined with behavioral descriptions
- [ ] Mission and vision statements available
- [ ] Meeting rhythm preferences understood (cadence, duration, participants)
- [ ] Communication tool preferences identified (Slack vs Teams, etc.)
- [ ] OKR/goal-setting framework preference confirmed
- [ ] Tool stack inventory available
- [ ] Onboarding timeline expectations set

### Output Format Verification
- [ ] HTML template located at `html-templates/operational-playbook-creator.html`
- [ ] Score banner metrics: Headcount, Departments, Core Processes, Meetings, Tools, Y1 Target
- [ ] All 10 sections have content ready:
  1. Company Foundation (mission, vision, 3-5 values)
  2. Organizational Structure (org chart + headcount growth chart)
  3. Core Processes (4 department processes minimum)
  4. Meeting Rhythms (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly)
  5. Communication Protocols (channels + SLA cards)
  6. OKRs & Goals (3 objectives with 2-3 KRs each)
  7. Tools & Systems (10-15 tools with categories)
  8. Onboarding Playbook (5-stage timeline)
  9. Company Culture & Rituals (6 rituals across cadences)
  10. Next Steps (6 prioritized action items)
- [ ] Chart.js data prepared for headcount growth chart
- [ ] All placeholder markers identified for replacement

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Processes are specific, not generic (includes timing, owners, SLAs)
- [ ] Values include behavioral definitions (what it looks like in practice)
- [ ] Meeting rhythms are realistic (not excessive for company size)
- [ ] Onboarding covers Pre-Day 1 through Day 30
- [ ] OKRs follow proper format (qualitative O, quantitative KRs)

**If any checkbox is incomplete, gather missing information before proceeding.**

## STEP 1: Detect Previous Context

### Ideal Context (All Present):
- **financial-model-architect** → Headcount plan, organizational growth roadmap
- **metrics-dashboard-designer** → KPIs, success metrics, dashboard structure
- **go-to-market-planner** → Sales process, customer success playbook
- **product-positioning-expert** → Company mission, vision, values

### Partial Context (Some Present):
- **financial-model-architect** → Headcount plan available
- **metrics-dashboard-designer** → KPIs and metrics framework available

### No Context:
- None of the above skills were run

---

## STEP 2: Context-Adaptive Introduction

### If Ideal Context:
> I found outputs from **financial-model-architect**, **metrics-dashboard-designer**, **go-to-market-planner**, and **product-positioning-expert**.
>
> I can reuse:
> - **Headcount plan** (current: [X], Year 1: [Y], by department)
> - **KPIs** (North Star Metric, AARRR metrics, success criteria)
> - **Sales process** (prospecting, demo, close, customer success)
> - **Mission/Vision** (company purpose and direction)
>
> **Proceed with this data?** [Yes/Start Fresh]

### If Partial Context:
> I found outputs from some upstream skills: [list which ones].
>
> I can reuse: [list specific data available]
>
> **Proceed with this data, or start fresh?**

### If No Context:
> No previous context detected.
>
> I'll guide you through creating your operational playbook from the ground up.

---

## STEP 3: Questions (One at a Time, Sequential)

### Company Foundation

**Question CF1: What are your mission, vision, and values?**

**Mission** = Why we exist (the problem we solve)
- [e.g., "Empower construction teams to build faster and more profitably"]

**Vision** = Where we're going (our 10-year goal)
- [e.g., "Become the operating system for the $10T construction industry"]

**Values** (3-5 core values that guide decisions):
1. [Value 1] — [What it means in practice]
2. [Value 2] — [What it means in practice]
3. [Value 3] — [What it means in practice]

**Example Values**:
- **"Customer obsession"** → We talk to 10 customers per week, not per quarter
- **"Move fast"** → Ship features in days, not months
- **"Own it"** → No "that's not my job" — everyone owns outcomes

**Your Mission, Vision, Values**:
- Mission: [Why we exist]
- Vision: [10-year goal]
- Values: [3-5 values with definitions]

---

### Decision-Making Framework

**Question DM1: What is your decision-making framework?**

**Decision-Making Principles**:

### 1. Type 1 vs. Type 2 Decisions (Amazon framework)
- **Type 1** (One-way doors): Hard to reverse (hiring, fundraising, major pivots) → Slow, deliberate, leadership decides
- **Type 2** (Two-way doors): Easy to reverse (A/B tests, feature experiments, pricing tests) → Fast, autonomous, anyone can decide

### 2. Disagree and Commit
- Everyone voices opinion
- Once decision is made, everyone commits (even if they disagreed)

### 3. Decision Owner
- Every decision has a clear owner (not committee-driven)
- Owner consults stakeholders, but ultimately decides

### 4. Decision Log
- Document major decisions (what, why, who, when)
- Helps onboard new team members, avoid re-litigating decisions

**Your Decision-Making Framework**:
- [Framework 1] — e.g., "Type 1 vs. Type 2 decisions"
- [Framework 2] — e.g., "Disagree and commit"
- [Framework 3] — e.g., "Decision owner (not committee)"

### Section 11: Next Steps
- Finalize playbook this month
- Share with team, get feedback, iterate
- Update quarterly as company scales
- Use playbook to onboard all new hires

---

## STEP 5: Quality Review & Iteration

After generating the strategy, I will ask:

**Quality Check**:
1. Is the mission/vision/values clear and inspiring?
2. Are core processes documented (engineering, sales, CS, marketing)?
3. Are meeting rhythms realistic and not excessive?
4. Are communication channels and SLAs clear?
5. Is the onboarding playbook comprehensive (Day 1, Week 1, Day 30)?
6. Are cultural rituals defined (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)?

**Iterate?** [Yes — refine X / No — finalize]

---

## STEP 6: Save & Next Steps

Once finalized, I will:
1. **Save** the operational playbook to your shared documentation (Notion, Confluence, etc.)
2. **Suggest** sharing with entire team and getting feedback
3. **Remind** you to update quarterly as company scales

---

## 8 Critical Guidelines for This Skill

1. **Document everything**: If it's not written down, it doesn't exist. Processes in people's heads don't scale.

2. **Keep it simple**: Playbooks should be scannable, not novels. Use bullet points, templates, examples.

3. **Living document**: Playbooks are never "done". Update quarterly as you learn what works and what doesn't.

4. **Default to async**: Don't schedule meetings that can be emails, Slack messages, or Loom videos.

5. **Clear ownership**: Every process, decision, and meeting needs a clear owner. No committees.

6. **Culture is what you do, not what you say**: Values are meaningless if not practiced. Document how values show up in daily work.

7. **Onboarding makes or breaks**: First 30 days determine employee success. Invest heavily in onboarding playbook.

8. **Fewer meetings, better meetings**: Every meeting needs agenda, owner, notes, and action items. Otherwise, cancel it.
