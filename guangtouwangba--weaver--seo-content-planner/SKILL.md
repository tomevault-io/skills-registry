### Ideal Context (All Present):

- **customer-persona-builder** → Target personas, search behavior, questions they ask
- **product-positioning-expert** → Positioning, key messages, differentiation
- **competitive-intelligence** → Competitor analysis, market gaps
- **brand-identity-designer** → Brand voice, tone for content

### Partial Context (Some Present):
- Only **content-marketing-strategist** + **customer-persona-builder**
- Only **product-positioning-expert** + **competitive-intelligence**
- Basic product/service description with target market

### No Context:
- No previous skill outputs detected

## STEP 2: Context-Adaptive Introduction

### If IDEAL CONTEXT detected:

```

### If PARTIAL CONTEXT detected:

I found partial context from previous analyses:

[Quote relevant details]

I have some context but need additional information about your current SEO performance, target keywords, and technical setup to build a comprehensive SEO strategy.

## 5. On-Page Optimization Guidelines

**Title Tag Formula**:
```
[Target Keyword] - [Modifier] | [Brand Name]
```

**Examples**:

- Bad: "Home - [Brand]" (no keyword, not descriptive)

**Title Tag Guidelines**:
- **Length**: 50-60 characters (appears fully in search results)
- **Keyword Placement**: Target keyword near the beginning
- **Brand**: Include brand name at end (separated by | or -)
- **Compelling**: Write for clicks, not just keywords
- **Unique**: Every page has unique title (no duplicates)

**Title Tag Template by Page Type**:

**Blog Post**:
```
[Number] [Adjective] [Keyword] [Modifier] [Year if relevant]
```
Example: "15 Best Construction Project Management Tools (2025 Guide)"

```

```

**Category Page**:
```

```
Example: "Project Management: Software & Tools for Construction | Acme"

---

### Meta Description Optimization

```
[Hook] [Benefit] [Call-to-Action]
```

**Examples**:
- Good: "Tired of spreadsheets for project tracking? Acme helps contractors manage projects from mobile devices. Start free trial today."
- Bad: "Welcome to our website. We offer project management solutions." (generic, no CTA)

**Meta Description Guidelines**:
- **Length**: 150-160 characters (appears fully in search results)
- **Include Keyword**: Appears in bold in search results when user searches for it
- **Benefit-Focused**: What's in it for the reader?
- **Call-to-Action**: "Learn more", "Try free", "Read guide", etc.
- **Unique**: Every page has unique meta description

---

### Header Tag Structure

**Header Hierarchy**:
```
H1: Page Title (One per page, includes target keyword)
├─ H2: Main Section 1 (includes related keyword)
│  ├─ H3: Subsection 1.1
│  └─ H3: Subsection 1.2
├─ H2: Main Section 2 (includes related keyword)
│  ├─ H3: Subsection 2.1
│  └─ H3: Subsection 2.2
└─ H2: Main Section 3 (includes related keyword)
```

**Header Guidelines**:
- **H1**: Only ONE per page, matches or similar to title tag
- **H2s**: Main sections, include target keyword and variations naturally
- **H3s**: Subsections under H2s, can include long-tail keywords
- **Never Skip**: Don't go from H2 to H4 (skip H3)
- **Descriptive**: Headers describe section content, not "Introduction" or "Section 1"

**Example**:
```
H1: Complete Guide to Construction Project Management (2025)

H2: What is Construction Project Management?

### Internal Linking Strategy

**Internal Linking Goals**:
- Distribute "link juice" (page authority) throughout site
- Help search engines discover and crawl all pages
- Guide users to related content (improves engagement, reduces bounce rate)
- Establish topical authority (show expertise across cluster)

**Internal Linking Rules**:
1. **Link from High Authority Pages**: Homepage, pillar pages → supporting content
2. **Link Within Clusters**: All supporting articles link to pillar page and 2-3 other articles in cluster
3. **Use Descriptive Anchor Text**: "construction project management software" not "click here"
4. **Link Deep**: Don't just link to homepage and product pages - link to blog posts
5. **Contextual Links**: Links within body content (not just footer/sidebar)
6. **Reasonable Number**: 3-10 internal links per 1,500-word article (don't overdo it)

**Internal Linking Opportunities**:
- [ ] Blog posts → Pillar pages
- [ ] Blog posts → Related blog posts
- [ ] Pillar pages → Supporting articles
- [ ] Product pages → Use case blog posts
- [ ] Homepage → Top pillar pages and product pages
- [ ] Author bios → Relevant articles by that author

---

### Image Optimization

**Image SEO Checklist**:

- [ ] **Alt Text**: Describes image, includes keyword naturally (e.g., "Screenshot of construction project management app showing Gantt chart")
- [ ] **File Size**: Compressed for fast loading (<100KB for most images)
- [ ] **Format**: WebP for smallest size, JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics/logos
- [ ] **Dimensions**: Sized appropriately (don't use 3000px wide image for 600px space)
- [ ] **Captions**: When helpful (provides context, can include keywords)
- [ ] **Schema**: Image schema for important images (products, logos)

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways

**1. SEO is a Marathon, Not a Sprint**
Expect to see meaningful results in 3-6 months. Don't expect page 1 rankings after publishing one article.

**2. Content Clusters Build Authority**
Instead of random blog posts, build clusters around core topics. This establishes you as an authority and improves all rankings in that cluster.

**3. Technical Foundation Matters**
Even the best content won't rank if your site is slow, not mobile-friendly, or has crawl errors. Fix technical issues first.

**4. Link Building = Relationship Building**
Earn backlinks by creating valuable content and building relationships with industry sites. Don't buy links or use shady tactics.

**5. Track What Matters**

## STEP 12: Quality Review & Iteration

After generating the SEO content strategy, present it and ask:

```
I've created your SEO Content Strategy with [X] content clusters and 90-day content calendar.

**Quality Check**:
- Does the keyword strategy target the right search intent?
- Are content clusters comprehensive and well-structured?
- Is the technical SEO audit thorough?
- Does the link building strategy align with your resources?
- Is the 90-day calendar realistic given your capacity?

Would you like me to:
1. Refine keyword list or cluster structure
2. Adjust content calendar timeline
3. Add more link building tactics
4. Finalize this version

(I can do up to 2 revision passes if needed)
```

## STEP 13: Save & Next Steps

After final approval:

```
Perfect! Your SEO Content Strategy is ready.

**Save Options**:
1. Save as: `seo-content-strategy-[business-name].md`
2. Custom filename
3. Just keep in conversation (I'll remember for downstream skills)

**Next Recommended Skills**:

Which filename would you like (or enter custom)?

## Critical Guidelines

**1. Focus on Search Intent, Not Just Keywords**
Ranking for a keyword is useless if the searcher's intent doesn't match what you offer. Commercial intent ("best X") converts better than informational ("what is X").

**2. Build Topic Authority Through Content Clusters**
One 5,000-word pillar page surrounded by 15 supporting articles (cluster) ranks better than 16 random blog posts.

**3. Technical SEO is Foundation**
Fix crawlability, site speed, mobile before creating content. Best content won't rank if Google can't crawl it or users bounce due to slow load.

**4. Quality > Quantity**
One great pillar page (3,000-5,000 words, comprehensive, visual) beats 10 mediocre 500-word posts.

**5. Link Building = Relationship Building, Not Spam**
Guest posts, linkable assets, digital PR work. Buying links, link exchanges, comment spam don't.

**6. Track Rankings by Cluster, Not Individual Keywords**
Track how all keywords in Cluster 1 are performing collectively, not just one keyword.

**7. Optimize for Featured Snippets and "People Also Ask"**
Add FAQ sections, answer questions directly, use lists and tables. Earning featured snippet = position zero.

**8. SEO is Marathon, Not Sprint**
Results take 3-6 months. Don't expect page 1 rankings after 1 article. Consistency wins.
