# Session Checkpoint

> **CRITICAL: This skill runs near context window limits. Minimize tool calls — no subagents, no file exploration. Use only conversation context. Write files in one shot.**

## Commands

- **Save:** `save checkpoint {name}`, `save checkpoint` (auto-picks name from context)
- **Resume:** `continue`, `continue {name}`, `resume` (auto-select if one checkpoint, list if many)
- **Cleanup:** `clear checkpoint {name}`, `clear all checkpoints`

---

## Save Procedure

### 1. Determine Name

If user gave a name, use it.

If no name given:
- Pick a short descriptive name from the current work (2-4 words, e.g., "my-feature") and use it directly — don't ask for confirmation. The user sees the name in the output.

Sanitize final name: lowercase, replace spaces/`/` with `-`, strip leading `-`.

### 2. Locate Memory Directory

Find the auto memory directory path from the system prompt line:
`You have a persistent auto memory directory at <path>`

### 3. Gather State

Run in a single bash call:

```bash
git branch --show-current && git status --short | head -10 && date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'
```

From conversation context, determine:
- What was accomplished this session
- What failed or was abandoned (and why)
- Where work left off — don't infer next steps, but DO capture all actionable context the next session needs: pending decisions, proposed options, open questions
- Which files were modified

### 4. Find Active Plan

If the system prompt or conversation already references a plan file (`~/.claude/plans/*.md`), note its path and determine step N of M. Otherwise skip. **Do NOT search for or glob plan files.**

### 5. Write Checkpoint File

If `checkpoint-{name}.md` already exists, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm — show the existing checkpoint's **Saved** date and **Left Off** summary, with options: "Overwrite" / "Different name" (user provides new name via "Other"). If they choose a different name, continue from this step with the new name.

Write `<memory_dir>/checkpoint-{name}.md`:

```markdown
# Checkpoint: {name}

- **Branch:** `{branch}`
- **Saved:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
- **Plan:** `~/.claude/plans/{file}` (step N of M)

## Left Off
{1-3 lines describing where work stopped}

## Done This Session
- {accomplishments}

## Failed Approaches
- {what + why — or "None"}

## Modified Files
- {list}
```

Omit the **Plan:** line if no plan file exists.

### 6. Update MEMORY.md Index

**Always use `Edit` (not `Write`) for MEMORY.md changes** — parallel sessions would clobber each other with `Write`.

Read MEMORY.md. Find the `## Active Checkpoints` section.

- If checkpoint name already in index: update its line.
- If not: add a new bullet.
- If no `## Active Checkpoints` section exists: insert it after the first `#` heading. If MEMORY.md doesn't exist, create it with `# Project Memory` as the heading.

Bullet format:
```
- **{name}** ({branch}, {Mon DD}) — {one-line summary}
```

Keep the ``Resume any: `continue` or `continue {name}` `` line after the bullets.

Do NOT touch any other sections in MEMORY.md.

### 7. Output

Keep output minimal — this often runs near end of context window.

```
Checkpoint "{name}" saved. Resume anytime: `continue {name}`
```

That's it. Don't ask follow-up questions. Don't suggest `/compact` or `/clear` — the user manages their own context window.

---

## Resume Procedure

### 1. Determine Name

If user gave a name, use it.
If no name given:
- List `checkpoint-*.md` files in memory directory
- If exactly one: use it automatically
- If multiple: use `AskUserQuestion` with checkpoint names as options (include branch and date in each option's description)
- If none: report "No saved checkpoints found." and stop

### 2. Read Checkpoint File

Read `<memory_dir>/checkpoint-{name}.md`.
If file missing: remove the orphaned bullet from MEMORY.md's `## Active Checkpoints`, report "Checkpoint file missing (cleaned up stale entry)", and stop.

### 3. Check Branch

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

If current branch differs from checkpoint's branch, warn:
```
Warning: You're on `{current}` but checkpoint was saved on `{saved}`. Switch with: git checkout {saved}
```

Continue regardless — user decides.

### 4. Load Plan

If checkpoint references a plan file, read it.

### 5. Present and Begin

Output the checkpoint summary and last context. If **Failed Approaches** is non-empty, include them:
```
⚠ Previously failed: {approach} — {why}
```

### 6. Auto-Clear

The checkpoint is now consumed — context is live. Delete the checkpoint file and remove its bullet from MEMORY.md's `## Active Checkpoints` (same as Cleanup steps 1-2). If no bullets remain, remove the entire section.

Do NOT mention the cleanup to the user. They see only the summary from step 5, then wait for their direction.

---

## Cleanup Procedure

### 1. Delete File

Remove the checkpoint file via Bash:
```bash
rm <memory_dir>/checkpoint-{name}.md
```

### 2. Update MEMORY.md

Remove the bullet for `{name}` from `## Active Checkpoints`.
If no bullets remain, remove the entire section (header + resume line).

### 3. Output

```
Cleared checkpoint "{name}"
```

### `clear all checkpoints`

Glob `checkpoint-*.md` in memory directory. Delete all matches. Remove the entire `## Active Checkpoints` section (header + bullets + resume line) from MEMORY.md. Output:

```
Cleared {N} checkpoint(s)
```
