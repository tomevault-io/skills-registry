# Working with the Pencil MCP Server

## Non-negotiable rules

- `.pen` files are **JSON-based**, human-readable, and Git-diffable. You _can_ read them with standard filesystem tools, but **always use Pencil MCP tools** (`batch_get`, `batch_design`, etc.) for design operations — they handle IDs correctly, apply layout calculations, and prevent format-breaking manual edits.
- Avoid hand-editing a `.pen` file directly. Manual edits can break internal references, component linkages, or variable bindings — even though the format is plain JSON.
- When in doubt about a node's ID or structure, **look it up** — never guess node IDs.

---

## Starting every task

Begin with **`get_editor_state()`** unless the user has given you an explicit file path. This tells you:
- Which `.pen` file is currently open and active
- The current user selection (selected node IDs)
- Other essential context (canvas state, viewport)

If no document is open, call `open_document("new")` to create a blank canvas, or `open_document("<path>")` to open a specific file.

---

## Core workflow

### 1. Understand the canvas

Before placing anything, understand what's already there:

- **`batch_get(patterns, nodeIds)`** — discover nodes by name patterns (e.g., `["*header*", "*nav*"]`) or by specific IDs. This is your primary exploration tool.
- **`snapshot_layout()`** — get computed bounding rectangles for every node. Use this to understand spatial relationships and decide where to insert new content.
- **`find_empty_space_on_canvas(direction, size)`** — find open areas on the canvas when you need to add new screens or components without overlap.

### 2. Get design direction

When building screens from scratch or styling existing content, orient yourself with guidelines and a style guide:

```
get_guidelines(topic)   # topic: code | table | tailwind | landing-page | slides |
                         #         design-system | mobile-app | web-app
```

After guidelines, use `get_style_guide_tags()` to see available tags, then `get_style_guide(tags, name)` to load a matching style guide. Style guides provide color palettes, typography, and component patterns that make designs cohesive.

### 3. Design or edit

All mutations go through **`batch_design(operations)`**. This accepts a script of operations — aim for up to 25 per call. Make operations meaningful and group logically related changes together.

### 4. Validate visually

After significant changes, call **`get_screenshot(nodeId?)`** to see the result. Use this to catch layout issues, misaligned elements, or off-palette colors before moving on. Don't skip this step after major design blocks.

---

## batch_design operation syntax

Every line is a single operation. Variables assigned in one line are usable in subsequent lines of the same call.

### Insert — create a new node

```
foo = I("parentId", { ...properties })
```

### Copy — clone an existing node into a new parent

```
bar = C("sourceNodeId", "parentId", { ...overrides })
```

### Replace — swap out one or more nodes with new content

```
R("nodeId1/nodeId2", { ...properties })
```

### Update — mutate properties of an existing node

```
U("nodeId", { ...properties })
U(foo + "/childId", { ...properties })   # combine with variable from earlier line
```

### Delete

```
D("nodeId")
```

### Move — reorder or reparent a node

```
M("nodeId", "newParentId", insertionIndex)
```

### Generate image with AI

```
G("nodeId", "ai", "descriptive prompt for the image")
```

**Tip**: Assign results to variables (`foo = I(...)`) whenever you'll reference those nodes later in the same batch. String concatenation with `/` navigates into children.

---

## Variables and themes

- `get_variables()` — read all design tokens (colors, spacing, font sizes) and themes currently defined in the file.
- `set_variables(variables)` — add or update tokens. Changing a token here propagates to every node that references it — this is the right way to do global rebranding.

Always read variables before touching colors or typography, so you use the proper token names rather than raw hex values.

---

## Bulk find-and-replace

When you need to change a property everywhere (e.g., swap a font family across the whole design):

1. **`search_all_unique_properties(parentIds)`** — discover every distinct property value present under those parents. Shows you what you're working with.
2. **`replace_all_matching_properties(parentIds, matchProps, newProps)`** — replace all nodes that match a property pattern with new values. Far more reliable than identifying and updating each node individually.

---

## Exporting

```
export_nodes(nodeIds, format, outputFolder)
# format: "PNG" | "JPEG" | "WEBP" | "PDF"
```

Always confirm node IDs via `batch_get` before exporting — exporting the wrong node is a common mistake.

---

## Supported AI assistants

Pencil works with multiple AI tools through MCP. Not all tools support every feature — see [references/setup-troubleshooting.md](references/setup-troubleshooting.md) for installation and connection details.

- **Claude Code** (CLI and IDE)
- **Claude Desktop**
- **Cursor** (AI-powered IDE)
- **Windsurf IDE** (Codeium)
- **Codex CLI** (OpenAI)
- **Antigravity IDE**
- **OpenCode CLI**

The MCP server runs **locally** — no cloud dependency for design operations. AI assistants connect via MCP when Pencil is running. View available tools in your IDE's MCP settings.

## Components and instances

Any element can become a reusable component:

1. Select the element on the canvas
2. Press **`Cmd/Ctrl + Option/Alt + K`** (or click "Create component" in the properties panel)
3. The element becomes the **component origin**, shown with a **magenta** bounding box

To create an **instance**, copy the component origin on the canvas. Instances show a **violet** bounding box. Click "Go to component" in the properties panel to navigate back to the origin.

To **detach** an instance (break the link to its origin): **`Cmd/Ctrl + Option/Alt + X`**.

Via MCP, components are objects with `reusable: true` and instances use `type: "ref"`. See [references/pen-format.md](references/pen-format.md) for the full component/instance/override model.

---

## Slots

Slots are designated areas within a component where elements can be dropped in.

**Creating a slot (UI):**
1. Create a frame inside a component origin
2. Keep the frame empty
3. Click "Make a slot" in the properties panel

Slots appear with diagonal lines on the canvas. You can mark other components as "suggested slot components" — for example, a `table` component's slot can suggest `table-row` as content. This guides both human and AI designers.

Via MCP, slots are defined with the `slot` property on a frame (an array of suggested component IDs). See [references/pen-format.md](references/pen-format.md).

---

## Design libraries

Design libraries are collections of reusable components that can be shared across `.pen` files.

**Creating a library:**
1. Create a `.pen` file and populate it with components
2. In the layers panel, click the "Libraries" icon
3. Click "Turn this file into a library" — the file becomes `.lib.pen`

> Once a file is marked as a library, this **cannot be undone**.

**Using a library:**
1. In the layers panel → Libraries icon → select the library to import
2. In the layers panel → Assets icon → drag and drop components onto the canvas

Changes to components in a library file propagate to every file that uses them.

---

## Importing from Figma

Pencil can import Figma designs:

- **Complete .fig files:** Toolbar → click chevron below Rectangle icon → "Import Figma" (or File → Import Image/SVG/Figma in the desktop app)
- **Individual layers:** Copy elements in Figma, paste onto the Pencil canvas

> **Note:** Copying and pasting *image* elements from Figma is not supported. Import the complete file or add images manually.

**Image import:** Drag-and-drop, copy-paste, or toolbar/file menu. Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, SVG.

**Built-in icon libraries:** Material Symbols (Outlined, Rounded, Sharp), Lucide Icons, Feather, Phosphor. Custom SVG icons can be imported the same way as images.

---

## Design quality principles

- **Use the style guide.** Don't hardcode colors or fonts unless the user explicitly provides them. Load a style guide that matches the context (landing-page, mobile-app, etc.) and use its tokens.
- **Respect existing structure.** Read the canvas with `batch_get` and `snapshot_layout` before adding things — inserting into the wrong parent or overlapping existing content wastes iterations.
- **Validate after big changes.** `get_screenshot` is cheap. Use it to catch problems early rather than building several more layers on top of a broken foundation.
- **Keep batches focused.** Grouping 25 tightly related operations is good. Cramming unrelated sections into one giant call makes it hard to debug if something goes wrong.
- **Avoid guessing IDs.** Node IDs look like `dfFAeg2`. Always discover them via `batch_get` or from the result of a previous `I()` or `C()` call. Random strings will silently target the wrong node or fail.

## Common task patterns

### Add a new screen to an existing file

```
1. get_editor_state()                          # learn active file
2. find_empty_space_on_canvas(direction, size) # find where to put it
3. get_guidelines("web-app")                   # or mobile-app, landing-page, etc.
4. get_style_guide_tags() → get_style_guide()  # visual direction
5. batch_design(...)                           # build the screen
6. get_screenshot(newRootNodeId)               # validate
```

### Restyle globally (e.g., change brand colors)

```
1. get_variables()                             # see existing tokens
2. set_variables({ primaryColor: "#new" })     # update the token
3. search_all_unique_properties([rootId])      # verify propagation
4. get_screenshot()                            # confirm visually
```

### Explore an unfamiliar design

```
1. get_editor_state()
2. batch_get(["*"], [])                        # broad pattern match
3. snapshot_layout()                           # spatial context
```

### Export assets for handoff

```
1. batch_get(["*icon*", "*logo*"])             # find the right nodes
2. export_nodes([id1, id2], "PNG", "~/Desktop/assets")
```

## Design → Code

Pencil designs can be translated into production-ready code for all major platforms:

| Platform | Framework | Pencil support |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Web | React + Tailwind | ✅ Native guidelines (`get_guidelines("code")` + `get_guidelines("tailwind")`) |
| Web | Vue, Angular, Svelte, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS | ✅ Via design extraction |
| Android | Jetpack Compose, XML layouts | ✅ Via design extraction |
| iOS | SwiftUI, UIKit | ✅ Via design extraction |
| macOS | SwiftUI, AppKit | ✅ Via design extraction |
| Windows | WPF, WinUI 3, XAML | ✅ Via design extraction |
| Linux | GTK 4, Qt/QML | ✅ Via design extraction |

### Extraction workflow

Run this for every platform before writing any code.

**Step 1 — Understand the design**

```
get_editor_state()                        # confirm which .pen file is open
batch_get(["*"], [])                      # discover all nodes; note IDs
snapshot_layout()                         # get x, y, width, height for every node
get_variables()                           # read colors, spacing, typography tokens
get_screenshot(rootNodeId)                # visual reference
```

**Step 2 — Extract component details**

For each component you need to implement:

```
batch_get([], ["nodeId"], { maxDepth: 10, includePathGeometry: true })
```

Key properties to record:
- `type` — frame, text, image, shape, component_ref, etc.
- `fill`, `stroke`, `cornerRadius`, `opacity` — appearance
- `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `textAlign`, `lineHeight` — typography
- `layoutMode` (horizontal/vertical), `padding*`, `itemSpacing` — layout
- `width`, `height`, `x`, `y` (from `snapshot_layout`) — size & position
- `sizing` (`fill_container` / `fit_content` / fixed) — how to size the node
- `children` — nested structure
- `geometry` — SVG paths (icons, logos)

**Step 3 — Map to platform concepts**

Load the reference file that matches the target platform **before writing any code**:

| Target | File to read |
|--------|-------------|
| React / Tailwind (preferred web) | [references/web.md](references/web.md) |
| Vue / Angular / HTML+CSS+JS | [references/web.md](references/web.md) |
| Android (Jetpack Compose or XML) | [references/android.md](references/android.md) |
| iOS / macOS (SwiftUI or UIKit/AppKit) | [references/ios-macos.md](references/ios-macos.md) |
| Windows (WPF / WinUI 3 / XAML) | [references/windows.md](references/windows.md) |
| Linux (GTK 4 / Qt / QML) | [references/linux.md](references/linux.md) |

If the user hasn't specified a platform, ask. If the target codebase already exists, inspect it first to detect the framework in use — always match the project's existing stack.

**Step 4 — Validate**

After generating code, call `get_screenshot` on the relevant node and compare visually. Any obvious mismatches in color, spacing, or layout need fixing before hand-off.

### Design-to-code principles

- **Match the project.** If a codebase already exists, explore it to find the framework, styling approach, existing components, and conventions. Update existing components instead of creating duplicates.
- **Use design tokens, not hardcoded values.** Read `get_variables()` and map token names to the project's theming system.
- **Preserve content exactly.** Use the same text labels, icon names, and spacing as in the design.
- **No documentation files.** After generating code, do not create Markdown changelogs or README updates unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Validate visually.** Use `get_screenshot` to compare design vs. implementation and iterate until they match.

## Code → Design

Pencil supports importing existing code into designs. The AI agent can read your source files and recreate them visually in a `.pen` file.

**Requirements:**
- Keep the `.pen` file in the **same workspace** as your code so the AI agent can access both
- Have Pencil and the AI assistant running

**Workflow:**
1. Open your `.pen` file
2. Open AI chat (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`)
3. Ask to import code:

```
Recreate the Button component from src/components/Button.tsx
Import the LoginForm from my codebase into this design
Add the Header component from src/layouts/Header.tsx
```

**What gets imported:** component structure/hierarchy, layout/positioning, styling (colors, typography, spacing).

---

## Two-way sync

The most powerful workflow combines Design → Code and Code → Design:

1. **Start with code** — Import existing components into Pencil
2. **Design improvements** — Make visual changes in Pencil
3. **Update code** — Ask AI to apply changes back to code
4. **Iterate** — Repeat as needed

### CSS variables ↔ Pencil variables

Create a synchronized design token system:

**Import CSS to Pencil:**
```
Create Pencil variables from my globals.css
Import design tokens from src/styles/tokens.css
```

**Export Pencil to CSS:**
```
Update globals.css with these Pencil variables
Sync these design tokens to my CSS
```

### Recommended workflows

**Start new features:**
1. Design in Pencil first → generate initial code → refine implementation → update design if needed

**Update existing features:**
1. Import component into Pencil → make design changes → sync changes back to code

**Design system maintenance:**
1. Define variables in Pencil → sync to CSS → use variables in both design and code → update once, apply everywhere

### File organization

Keep `.pen` files alongside code so the AI agent can see both:

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   └── styles/
├── design.pen      ← Design file in the same repo
└── package.json
```
