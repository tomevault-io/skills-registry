# Quality Rules

**MANDATORY — Output hygiene:** Never use gremlin/invisible characters in any generated text. Use only standard space (U+0020) and normal line breaks (LF/CRLF). No zero-width (U+200B, U+200D, U+200C), no non-breaking space (U+00A0) unless required, no control or separator characters (U+2028, U+2029). Rewrite pasted content as clean text instead of copying raw.

## Code Quality

### Commit Standards

- Use conventional commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, test
- Present tense, imperative mood
- **Always write commit messages in English**
- Include Linear issue references when applicable
- Keep descriptions concise but descriptive

### Code Style

- Follow project-specific linting rules
- Maintain consistent code style across the project
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include proper error handling
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic

### Lint and format fix workflow (Trunk)

When fixing lint, format, or style issues in a project that uses Trunk:

1. **First:** Run `trunk check --fix` to auto-fix everything Trunk can fix.
2. **Then:** Address any remaining issues manually (what Trunk reports but could not auto-fix).
3. Re-run `trunk check` (or `trunk check --fix`) to confirm all issues are resolved.

Do not manually fix what Trunk can fix; let Trunk do it first, then the agent resolves the rest.

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Organize imports and dependencies properly

## Quality Gates

### Pre-commit Checks

- All tests must pass before committing
- Linting must pass without errors
- Build must succeed
- Security scans must pass
- No sensitive data in commits

### Pre-PR Checks

- All quality gates must pass
- Code review requirements met
- Documentation updated
- Tests cover new functionality
- Performance impact assessed

### Pull Request Standards

- **Always write PR titles and descriptions in English**
- Use descriptive and clear PR titles
- Include comprehensive descriptions with context
- Reference Linear issues when applicable
- Follow conventional commit format for PR titles

### Testing Requirements

- All commands must be testable
- Include edge case testing
- Verify safety mechanisms work
- Test error handling paths
- Maintain test coverage standards

## Documentation Quality

### Content Standards

- Clear and concise explanations
- Practical examples and use cases
- Consistent formatting and structure
- Regular updates and maintenance
- Avoid redundant information
- Avoid overly complex explanations

### Structure Requirements

- Use proper markdown formatting
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Add code examples with syntax highlighting
- Include troubleshooting sections
- Provide clear navigation

### Maintenance

- Keep documentation up to date
- Review and update regularly
- Remove outdated information
- Add new features to documentation
- Solicit feedback from users

## Performance Quality

### Efficiency Standards

- Optimize for performance when possible
- Avoid unnecessary operations
- Use appropriate data structures
- Monitor resource usage
- Profile critical paths

### Scalability Considerations

- Design for growth
- Consider multi-repository scenarios
- Plan for increased usage
- Optimize for large codebases
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## Security Quality

### Data Protection

- Never commit sensitive information
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize user data
- Follow security best practices

### Access Control

- Implement proper authentication
- Use least privilege principle
- Audit access patterns
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Regular security reviews

## Integration Quality

### API Design

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Provide clear error messages
- Include proper status codes
- Document all endpoints
- Version APIs appropriately

### External Services

- Handle service failures gracefully
- Implement proper retry logic
- Monitor external dependencies
- Provide fallback mechanisms
- Log integration issues

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging Standards

- Use appropriate log levels
- Include relevant context
- Avoid logging sensitive data
- Structure logs for analysis
- Implement log rotation

### Metrics and Monitoring

- Track key performance indicators
- Monitor error rates
- Set up alerts for critical issues
- Regular health checks
- Performance monitoring

## Output / Character Hygiene (Gremlin Characters)

**Known Cursor/LLM issue:** Models sometimes emit invisible Unicode despite instructions. See `docs/gremlin-characters-cursor-llm.md` for references and full list.

The AI must ensure that all generated text—including code, comments, documentation, and user-facing messages—is free from "gremlin characters" (invisible or problematic Unicode). These cause rendering issues, lint errors (e.g. `no-irregular-whitespace`), and parsing errors.

### Prohibited Characters

Use only **U+0020** (space) and **LF/CRLF**. Avoid:

- **Zero-width**: U+200B (ZWSP), U+200C (ZWNJ), U+200D (ZWJ), U+2060 (word joiner), U+2063 (invisible separator)
- **Non-breaking / other spaces**: U+00A0 (NBSP), U+1680 (Ogham), U+180E (Mongolian vowel separator), U+2000–U+200A (en/em quad, figure space, thin space, etc.), U+202F (narrow NBSP), U+205F (medium math space), U+3000 (ideographic space), U+FEFF (BOM)
- **Line/paragraph**: U+2028 (line separator), U+2029 (paragraph separator)
- **Other**: U+00AD (soft hyphen), control characters (U+0000–U+001F, U+007F), directional formatting

### /gremlin-clean

When the user runs `/gremlin-clean`, follow **`commands/gremlin-clean.md`**: run `~/.cursor/scripts/strip-gremlins.py` on the target file(s) and report. Command is defined in `commands/` so it appears in the / menu.

### AI Enforcement

- Use only standard space (U+0020) and normal line breaks (LF/CRLF) in generated content.
- Do not insert zero-width or other invisible characters.
- When pasting or referencing external text, prefer rewriting as clean ASCII/Unicode rather than copying raw content that may contain gremlins.
- Prefer clear, readable text composed of standard visible characters only.
