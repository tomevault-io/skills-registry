# Base Pattern Documentation

## Purpose

This skill guides you through creating consistent, comprehensive documentation for base pattern classes and architectural components. Base patterns are foundational classes that other code extends or uses, such as `BaseView`, `BaseViewModel`, `MasterView`, etc.

## Documentation Structure

When documenting a base pattern, follow this structure:

### 1. Header Section

```dart
/// 🌟
/// [ClassName] is a [brief description of what it is and its primary purpose].
/// [Additional context about when and why to use it].
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// [Concrete example showing typical usage]
/// ```
///
/// Features:
/// - 🔗 [Feature 1 with emoji]
/// - 🛡️ [Feature 2 with emoji]
/// - 🧩 [Feature 3 with emoji]
/// - 🧬 [Feature 4 with emoji]
class [ClassName] {
```

**Guidelines:**
- Start with 🌟 emoji for base classes
- Provide a clear one-sentence description
- Include a complete, runnable example
- List 3-5 key features with descriptive emojis
- Use consistent emoji meanings:
  - 🔗 Dependency injection / Integration
  - 🛡️ Error handling / Safety
  - 🧩 Customization / Flexibility
  - 🧬 Lifecycle / State management
  - 🎯 Type safety
  - 🔍 Logging / Debugging
  - 🚀 Performance

### 2. Constructor Documentation

```dart
/// Creates a [ClassName] widget/instance.
///
/// [parameter1] is [description of what it does and when to use it].
/// [parameter2] is [description].
/// [parameter3] controls [what it controls].
const [ClassName]({
  this.parameter1,
  this.parameter2,
  this.parameter3,
});
```

**Guidelines:**
- Explain each parameter's purpose
- Mention when parameters are optional vs required
- Describe side effects or behaviors triggered by parameters

### 3. Type Definitions

For complex callback types, document them separately:

```dart
/// 🧑‍💻 Type definition for [purpose].
/// Useful for [use case].
typedef [TypeName] = [Type] Function([Parameters]);
```

**Common patterns:**
- `OnViewModelReady` - Called when view model is ready
- `OnViewModelEnd` - Called during disposal/cleanup
- `OnStateListener` - Reacts to state changes
- `BuilderCondition` - Controls when builder rebuilds

### 4. Method Documentation

```dart
/// [Brief description of what the method does].
/// 
/// Parameters:
/// - [param]: [Description]
/// - [param]: [Description]
/// 
/// Returns: [What it returns]
/// 
/// Throws: [What exceptions it might throw]
[ReturnType] [methodName]([parameters]) {
```

### 5. Lifecycle Methods

For lifecycle hooks, document the sequence:

```dart
/// Called during [lifecycle phase].
/// 
/// Typical use cases:
/// - [Use case 1]
/// - [Use case 2]
/// 
/// Note: [Important behavior or constraint]
@override
void [lifecycleMethod]() {
```

## Documentation Examples

### Example 1: Base View Widget

```dart
/// 🌟
/// BaseView is a generic widget that provides a convenient way to use BLoC and ViewModel patterns together.
/// It handles ViewModel lifecycle, state listening, and error reporting in a single place.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// BaseView<MyBloc, MyEvent, MyState>(
///   onViewModelReady: (bloc, context) => bloc.add(MyInitEvent()),
///   builder: (bloc, context, state) {
///     if (state is MyLoadingState) {
///       return CircularProgressIndicator();
///     }
///     if (state is MyLoadedState) {
///       return Text(state.data);
///     }
///     return SizedBox.shrink();
///   },
/// )
/// ```
///
/// Features:
/// - 🔗 Dependency injection via GetIt
/// - 🛡️ Error handling with FlutterError.reportError
/// - 🧩 Customizable builder, listener, and buildWhen
/// - 🧬 Lifecycle hooks for ViewModel
class BaseView<V extends BaseViewModelBloc<E, S>, E, S> extends StatefulWidget {
```

### Example 2: Base View Model

```dart
/// 🌟
/// BaseViewModelCubit is an abstract base class that extends Flutter's Cubit for state management.
/// It provides a standardized foundation for all Cubit-based view models in the application.
///
/// This class offers:
/// - 🔄 Simplified state management with custom emit methods
/// - 📊 Built-in state change logging capabilities
/// - 🛡️ Consistent state update patterns across the app
/// - 🧩 Extensible foundation for complex state management scenarios
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// class CounterCubit extends BaseViewModelCubit<int> {
///   CounterCubit() : super(0);
///
///   void increment() => stateChanger(state + 1);
///   void decrement() => stateChanger(state - 1);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Features:
/// - 🎯 Type-safe state management with generics
/// - 🔍 Automatic state change tracking
/// - 🚀 Performance optimized with Cubit's reactive architecture
/// - 🧪 Testing-friendly with controlled state updates
abstract class BaseViewModelCubit<S> extends Cubit<S> {
```

### Example 3: Master View Pattern

```dart
/// MasterView (BLoC-based) — reusable screen scaffold for feature views.
///
/// Purpose
/// - Provide consistent skeleton (app bar, safe area, paddings, footer/navbar spacers)
/// - Host `BaseView<V,E,S>` lifecycle and state listening
/// - Centralize error handling and default snackbars for high-level states
///
/// Extend points
/// - `viewContent(context, viewModel, state)`: render your feature UI
/// - `initialContent(viewModel, context)`: fire first effects (e.g., dispatch init event)
/// - `coreAppBar/coreBottomBar/bottomNavigationBar`: customize chrome
///
/// Example
/// ```dart
/// class ProductsView extends MasterView<MyBloc, MyEvent, MyState> {
///   ProductsView({super.key}) : super(currentView: MasterViewTypes.content);
///
///   @override
///   void initialContent(MyBloc vm, BuildContext context) {
///     vm.add(LoadProducts());
///   }
///
///   @override
///   Widget viewContent(BuildContext context, MyBloc vm, MyState state) {
///     if (state is Loading) return buildLoading();
///     if (state is Failure) return buildError(state.message);
///     return ProductsList(items: state.items);
///   }
/// }
/// ```
abstract class MasterView<V extends BaseViewModelBloc<E, S>, E, S>
    extends StatelessWidget {
```

## Documentation Checklist

When documenting a base pattern, ensure:

- [ ] Clear one-sentence description in header
- [ ] Complete, runnable code example
- [ ] 3-5 key features listed with emojis
- [ ] All public parameters documented
- [ ] Type definitions explained if complex
- [ ] Lifecycle methods documented with use cases
- [ ] Generic type parameters explained
- [ ] Extension points clearly marked (abstract methods, callbacks)
- [ ] Error handling behavior documented
- [ ] Integration points mentioned (DI, state management, etc.)

## Common Patterns to Document

### State Management Patterns
- Base view models (BLoC, Cubit, Hydrated)
- State classes (sealed classes, freezed unions)
- State change handlers

### View Patterns
- Base view widgets
- Master views / Scaffold wrappers
- View builders and composers

### Lifecycle Patterns
- Initialization hooks
- Disposal/cleanup handlers
- State change listeners

### Integration Patterns
- Dependency injection setup
- Error reporting integration
- Navigation helpers

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Vague descriptions**: "A widget that does stuff"
✅ **Specific**: "A generic widget that manages BLoC lifecycle and provides error handling"

❌ **Missing examples**: Documentation without code
✅ **Complete examples**: Runnable code showing typical usage

❌ **Undocumented parameters**: Public API without explanations
✅ **Fully documented**: Every public member explained

❌ **No feature list**: Just description
✅ **Feature highlights**: Key capabilities clearly listed

## When to Use This Skill

Apply this skill when:
- Creating new base classes that others will extend
