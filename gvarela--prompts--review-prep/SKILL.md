# Code Review Prep

Interactive walkthrough of changes as pair programming. Opens files in nvim pane, waits for questions.

## Supporting Script

This skill includes `nvim-helper.sh` for tmux/nvim operations. Add to your permissions to avoid repeated approvals:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(~/.claude/skills/review-prep/nvim-helper.sh:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Setup

1. Initialize nvim pane:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/review-prep/nvim-helper.sh setup
# Returns: NVIM_PANE=%123
```

2. Get the diff:

```bash
# Default: last commit
git show HEAD --stat

# Or specific range
git diff main..HEAD --stat
```

3. Parse changes into logical groups:
   - Group related hunks that solve same problem
   - Keep test files paired with their implementation

## Start Review

State the problem(s) being solved (1-2 max).

```
This diff addresses:
1. [Problem A] - files: x.ts, y.ts, x.test.ts
2. [Problem B] - files: z.ts

Total: N files, M logical changes
```

If more than 2-3 problems: flag as code smell, suggest splitting.

## For Each Change

1. Open file at line:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/review-prep/nvim-helper.sh open src/auth.ts 42
```

2. Focus nvim for user inspection:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/review-prep/nvim-helper.sh focus
```

3. Give ONE line context: "Change X/N - [Problem]. [brief description]"
4. Wait for questions

## TDD Check

For each production code change, verify:

- [ ] Corresponding test file changed?
- [ ] New code has test coverage?

Flag violations:

```
⚠ TDD: src/auth.ts changed but src/auth.test.ts unchanged
```

Don't block - just note. User decides if intentional.

## Navigation

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `next` | Next logical change |
| `back` | Previous change |
| `skip to [file]` | Jump to specific file |
| `show test` | Open corresponding test file |
| `done` | Wrap up review |

## Conversation Style

- Short responses - one or two lines max
- Wait for questions, don't front-load explanation
- Answer directly, then offer: "want to see the test?"
- Bounce up/down abstraction layers on request

## Wrap-up

When user says "done":

```
## Review Summary

**Changes reviewed**: X/Y
**Problems addressed**: [list]

**TDD Status**:
- ✓ Changes with tests: N
- ⚠ Changes without tests: M [list files if any]

**Notes**: [any flags raised during review]

Ready for PR? [yes/concerns]
```

## Script Reference

```bash
# Check if nvim pane exists
~/.claude/skills/review-prep/nvim-helper.sh status

# Setup (find or create nvim pane)
~/.claude/skills/review-prep/nvim-helper.sh setup

# Open file at specific line
~/.claude/skills/review-prep/nvim-helper.sh open FILE LINE

# Focus nvim pane
~/.claude/skills/review-prep/nvim-helper.sh focus
```

## Code Smell Flags

| Smell | Response |
|-------|----------|
| >2-3 problems per diff | "Consider splitting this PR" |
| Change doesn't map to stated problem | "This seems unrelated - intentional?" |
| Pattern repeated 3+ times | "Extract helper? (your call)" |
| Large file change, no tests | "Missing test coverage?" |
| Commented-out code added | "Dead code - remove?" |
