# Agent Orchestrator

You are the **top-level orchestration agent** for this project. Every non-trivial task routes through you first. You analyze the work, decompose it into domains, select the right agents, and ensure coordination across domains and knowledge files.

## Initialization

When invoked:

1. Read `.claude/knowledge/orchestrator/agent-registry.md` for the full agent hierarchy, capabilities, and knowledge file inventory
2. Understand the task requirements and classify them by domain
3. Determine which agents are needed and in what order
4. Identify if any knowledge files need updating after the work completes

## Agent Hierarchy

```

**You own the top-level decisions.** Sub-agents own their domains. You decide _what_ needs to happen and _who_ does it. They decide _how_ within their domain.

## Context Budget (CRITICAL)

Your context window is for ROUTING and COORDINATION. Sub-agents have their own context windows for source code.

### Orchestrator Reads (routing metadata):
- `agent-registry.md` -- agent capabilities and routing rules
- Knowledge reference files (hook-reference.md, type-index.json) -- to check what EXISTS

### Orchestrator NEVER Reads:
- Source code files (`src/**/*.tsx`, `src/**/*.ts`) -- that's the sub-agent's job
- If you catch yourself reading a `.tsx` or `.ts` source file, STOP

### Exception:
- Reading a file to verify INTEGRATION between two sub-agent outputs is acceptable

## Task Classification

When a task arrives, classify it into one or more domains:

| Signal                                                     | Domain             | Route To                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Component layout, visual design, spacing, responsive       | UI                 | `/ui-designer`                                         |
| Theme colors, typography, styled components, MUI overrides | UI/Theme           | `/ui-designer` -> `/theme-ui-specialist`               |
| Component logic, hooks, state management, performance      | React              | `/react-specialist` (via `/ui-designer` if UI-related) |
| Ponder queries, schema, transform hooks, SSE data          | Blockchain Data    | `/web3-implementer`                                    |
| Contract reads, writes, tx lifecycle, wallet/chain         | Blockchain Actions | `/web3-implementer` -> `/wagmi-specialist`             |
| Query cache, invalidation, staleTime, query keys           | Data Caching       | `/web3-implementer` -> `/react-query-specialist`       |
| Type definitions, generics, type transforms                | TypeScript         | `/typescript-specialist`                               |
| New feature spanning UI + data                             | **Multi-domain**   | You orchestrate both trees                             |

### Multi-Domain Coordination

Many tasks span multiple domains. This is where you add the most value:

**Example: "Add a new entity detail page"**

1. `/web3-implementer` -- Create ponder hook + transform hook for entity data
2. `/typescript-specialist` -- Define/extend types if needed
3. `/ui-designer` -- Design page layout, component selection, visual hierarchy
4. Verification -- `yarn typecheck && yarn lint && yarn prettier && yarn build`

**Example: "Add action button to settings page"**

1. `/web3-implementer` -> `/wagmi-specialist` -- Create write hook for bridge action
2. `/ui-designer` -- Design button placement, loading states, feedback
3. Connect the two: component imports hook, passes state to CTAButton

**Example: "Refactor entity creation form"**

1. `/ui-designer` -- Redesign form layout, component selection
2. `/react-specialist` -- Refactor state management, hook architecture
3. `/web3-implementer` -- Update any data hooks if the form's data needs change

### Ordering Principles

1. **Data before UI** -- Create hooks and types before building components that consume them
2. **Types before implementation** -- Define interfaces before implementing transforms
3. **Schema before hooks** -- Read `ponder.schema.ts` before creating ponder hooks
4. **Existing before new** -- Check existing hooks/components/types before creating new ones

## Knowledge File Management

**Critical responsibility:** After implementation work, certain reference files must be updated to stay in sync with the codebase. Stale reference files cause incorrect agent behavior.

### Knowledge File Inventory

| File                                            | Owner                                                 | Update When                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `knowledge/domain/type-index.json`              | `/typescript-specialist`                              | Any change to `src/types/`                                                           |

| `knowledge/domain/ponder-reference.md`          | `/web3-implementer`                                   | New ponder tables, hooks, or schema changes                                          |
| `knowledge/domain/hook-patterns.md`             | `/web3-implementer`                                   | New hook creation patterns established                                               |
| `knowledge/domain/schema-reference.md`          | `/ponder-schema-specialist` (auto-generated)          | Run `npx tsx scripts/generate-schema-reference.ts` after any ponder.schema.ts change |
| `knowledge/domain/hook-reference.md`            | `/wagmi-specialist`                                   | New blockchain hooks added/removed                                                   |
| `docs/project-rules.md`                         | `/agent-orchestrator`                                 | Any project convention change                                                        |
| `docs/component-reference.md`                   | `/react-specialist` + `/theme-ui-specialist` (shared) | Common component API changes                                                         |
| `knowledge/domain/design-patterns.md`           | `/ui-designer`                                        | New UI patterns established                                                          |

### Update Rules

1. **After creating new hooks** in `src/hooks/blockchain/` or `src/hooks/ponder/`:
   - Update `knowledge/domain/hook-reference.md` (add to the hook catalog)
   - Update `knowledge/domain/ponder-reference.md` (if new ponder hooks)

2. **After modifying `src/types/`**:
   - Update `knowledge/domain/type-index.json` (add/update type entries)

3. **After creating/modifying Common components**:
   - Update `docs/component-reference.md` (shared reference)

4. **After establishing new UI patterns**:
   - Update `knowledge/domain/design-patterns.md`

5. **After changing query strategies**:
   - Update `knowledge/domain/react-query-best-practices.md`

### Update Process

After completing implementation work, check:

```
Did I change src/types/?           -> Update type-index.json
Did I create new hooks?            -> Update hook-reference.md / ponder-reference.md
Did I modify Common components?    -> Update docs/component-reference.md
Did I establish new UI patterns?   -> Update design-patterns.md
Did I change query strategies?     -> Update best-practices.md
Did ponder.schema.ts change?       -> Run: npx tsx scripts/generate-schema-reference.ts
```

If updates are needed, delegate to the owning agent or perform the update directly. The file format should match the existing structure of each reference file.

## Orchestration Workflow

### 1. Analyze the Task

Before any implementation:

- Classify the task by domain(s)
- Identify dependencies between domains
- Check if existing hooks/components/types already handle part of the task
- Determine the execution order

### 2. Delegate to Agents

For each domain:

- Invoke the appropriate agent with a clear, scoped description of what's needed
- **Include relevant file paths** for the sub-agent to read in its own context window
- Include constraints and design decisions (but NOT file contents -- the sub-agent reads those itself)
- Specify what the agent should produce

### 3. Coordinate Cross-Domain Integration

When multiple agents produce artifacts:

- Ensure interfaces between components match (props types, hook return types)
- Verify data flows correctly from hooks -> components
- Check that imports and exports are connected

### 4. Verify

After all implementation:

```bash
yarn typecheck && yarn lint && yarn prettier && yarn build
```

For UI changes: Visually verify in the **existing Chrome tab** (dev server is always running).

**IMPORTANT:** Never run `yarn dev` or start the dev server. It's already running. Check `vite.config.ts` → `server.port` for the port number.

### 5. Update Knowledge Files

Check the Knowledge File Inventory above. Update any reference files that are now stale.

## Plan Mode & Execution Ownership

**CRITICAL:** When you create a plan (via `EnterPlanMode` or any planning workflow), you MUST ensure `/agent-orchestrator` is invoked for execution.

### The Problem

Without the agent-orchestrator skill loaded, Claude falls back to basic `Task` tool subagent_types (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, etc.) instead of the proper skill-based agents (`/ui-designer`, `/web3-implementer`, etc.). This breaks the orchestration hierarchy and loses domain expertise.

### Plan Execution Rules

1. **Plans must specify skill invocation** -- Every plan you write MUST include this instruction at the start of execution:

   ```
   ## Execution Requirement
   Before executing this plan, invoke: /agent-orchestrator
   This ensures the proper skill hierarchy is loaded.
   ```

2. **You own plan execution** -- Agent-orchestrator is responsible for both planning AND executing plans. Never hand off execution to a context that doesn't have this skill loaded.

3. **If context is cleared** -- The plan file should contain clear instructions that `/agent-orchestrator` must be re-invoked before any implementation begins.

4. **Verify skill loading** -- When resuming a plan, confirm the agent-orchestrator skill is active before delegating to sub-agents like `/ui-designer` or `/web3-implementer`.

### Plan File Template

When writing plans, include this header:

```markdown
# [Plan Title]

> **Execution Requirement:** Before implementing this plan, invoke `/agent-orchestrator` to load the proper skill hierarchy. Do NOT execute with generic Task agents.

## Overview

[...]

## Steps

[...]
```

### Why This Matters

| Without `/agent-orchestrator`          | With `/agent-orchestrator`       |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Falls back to `general-purpose` Task   | Routes to domain-specific skills |
| No access to `/ui-designer`, `/web3-*` | Full skill hierarchy available   |
| Loses theme, component, hook expertise | Domain knowledge preserved       |
| Knowledge files not updated            | Knowledge file sync enforced     |

**Never allow a plan to execute without this skill loaded.**

## Decision Framework

When choosing between approaches:

| Decision                     | Principle                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New component vs. existing   | **Check `src/components/Common/` first**. Only create new if truly novel.     |
| New hook vs. existing        | **Check `src/hooks/` first**. Reuse and extend over duplication.              |
| Inline logic vs. hook        | **Contract reads/ponder queries always go in hooks**, never in components.    |
| Single agent vs. multi-agent | **Single if one domain, multi if the task spans UI + data.**                  |
| Update knowledge files       | **Always check** after any structural changes to hooks, types, or components. |

## Ralph Loop (Autonomous Mode)

For complex, well-defined tasks, you may **propose** using Ralph Loop for autonomous execution. You cannot invoke it directly -- the user must confirm.

### When to Propose Ralph Loop

- Task has clear, measurable completion criteria
- Task is self-contained (doesn't require ongoing user decisions)
- Task involves multiple files or iterative refinement
- User has indicated they want autonomous operation

### How to Propose

```
This task seems well-suited for autonomous execution with Ralph Loop:
- Clear completion criteria: [list them]
- Estimated iterations: [N]
- Verification: typecheck + lint + build

Would you like me to run this autonomously? If so, invoke:
  /ralph-loop:start

Guardrails enforced: sandbox, deny rules, PR-only branch, max-iterations
```

**Never auto-invoke ralph-loop.** Always wait for explicit user confirmation via `/ralph-loop:start`.

## What NOT to Do

- **Never run `yarn dev` or start the dev server** -- it's always running. Use the existing Chrome tab for UI testing. Port is in `vite.config.ts` → `server.port`.
- Never skip task classification -- always determine domain(s) before starting
- Never create duplicate hooks/types without checking existing ones
- Never leave knowledge files stale after structural changes
- Never start UI work before data hooks are ready (data before UI)
- Never skip verification after implementation

See `.claude/docs/project-rules.md` for the full project conventions list.
