# Image Insight

## Overview

Analyze uploaded images and return structured JSON profiles containing
composition, color, lighting, subject, and background analysis with
actionable recreation parameters for AI image generation.

## Triggers

- `image-insight` - Primary trigger for image analysis
- "analyze this image" - Natural language trigger
- "extract visual style" - Style extraction request
- "generate image profile" - Profile generation request
- "what's in this image" - Detailed breakdown request

## Workflow

### Step 1: Receive Image

Accept the uploaded image file. Verify it's a valid image format.

### Step 2: Multi-Category Analysis

Analyze across all schema categories:

1. **metadata** - Confidence, image type, purpose
2. **composition** - Rule, layout, focal points, hierarchy
3. **color_profile** - Dominant colors with hex, palette, temperature
4. **lighting** - Type, direction, shadows, highlights
5. **technical_specs** - Medium, style, texture, depth of field
6. **artistic_elements** - Genre, influences, mood, atmosphere
7. **typography** - Fonts, placement (if text present)
8. **subject_analysis** - Expression, hair, hands, positioning
9. **background** - Setting, surfaces, objects catalog
10. **generation_parameters** - Recreation prompts, keywords

### Step 3: Apply Critical Area Rules

For portraits, apply detailed analysis per
[references/critical-areas.md](references/critical-areas.md):

- Hair: exact length, cut style, natural imperfections
- Hands: each hand separately, finger positions, tension
- Background: wall material distinction
  (drywall vs concrete vs brick)
- Lighting: directionality, shadow characteristics

### Step 4: Generate JSON Output

Return structured JSON following [references/json-schema.md](references/json-schema.md).

**Output requirements:**

- Valid JSON only - no markdown, no commentary
- All sections populated with specific values
- Hex codes for colors
- Actionable generation prompts

## Quick Reference

### Color Profile

```json
{
  "color": "coral pink",
  "hex": "#FF7F7F",
  "percentage": "35%",
  "role": "primary subject"
}
```

### Lighting Assessment

- **Directional**: Strong shadows, sculpted appearance
- **Diffused**: Soft minimal shadows, even illumination
- Assess: type, direction, shadow edge quality, contrast ratio

### Subject Analysis Priorities

1. Facial expression: mouth, eyes, emotion, authenticity
2. Hair: length, cut, texture, natural imperfections
3. Hands: position, tension, naturalness
4. Body: posture, angle, weight distribution

### references/

- [core-prompt.md](references/core-prompt.md) - Core analysis system prompt
- [json-schema.md](references/json-schema.md) - Complete JSON output schema
- [analysis-rules.md](references/analysis-rules.md) -
  Category-specific analysis rules
- [critical-areas.md](references/critical-areas.md) -
  Hair, hands, background, lighting details

### scripts/

- `validate_output.py` - Validate JSON structure and completeness

## Anti-Patterns

- **Vague descriptions**: Avoid "nice", "good", "beautiful" -
  use specific technical terms
- **Perfect hair**: Never describe hair as "perfect" -
  real hair has flyaways, frizz, variation
- **Generic backgrounds**: Don't say "wall" -
  specify material (painted drywall, concrete, brick)
- **Skipped hands**: Always document hand positions
  even if hidden or out of frame
- **Markdown in output**: Output pure JSON only -
  no code blocks, no explanatory text

## Extension Points

1. **Image Type Variants**: Create specialized schemas
   for landscapes, products, architecture
2. **Selective Analysis**: Add parameter to request specific categories only
3. **Batch Processing**: Extend for analyzing multiple images in sequence
4. **Confidence Thresholds**: Add configurable confidence scoring criteria

## Design Rationale

This skill encapsulates 15+ years of visual analysis expertise to:

1. Enable consistent, reproducible image analysis across different contexts
2. Generate actionable prompts for AI image recreation
   (Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.)
3. Provide structured data for downstream processing and automation
4. Standardize style extraction with emphasis on natural imperfections
   over idealized descriptions
5. Support multimodal analysis leveraging Claude's vision
   capability
