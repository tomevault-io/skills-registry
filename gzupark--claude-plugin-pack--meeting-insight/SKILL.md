# Meeting Insight

Transforms meeting transcripts into actionable insights about
communication patterns.

## Triggers

- Analyze meeting transcripts for communication patterns
- Get feedback on leadership/facilitation style
- Identify conflict avoidance moments
- Track speaking habits and filler words
- Compare communication improvement over time

## Supported Formats

`.txt`, `.md`, `.vtt`, `.srt`, `.docx`

## Workflow

### 1. Discover Data

```text
1. Scan folder for transcript files
2. Check for speaker labels and timestamps
3. Confirm date range of meetings
4. Identify user's name/identifier in transcripts
```

### 2. Clarify Analysis Goals

If not specified, ask what to analyze:

- Specific behaviors (conflict avoidance, interruptions, filler words)
- Communication effectiveness (clarity, directness, listening)
- Meeting facilitation skills
- Speaking patterns and ratios

### 3. Analyze Patterns

See [references/analysis-criteria.md](references/analysis-criteria.md)
for detailed criteria.

Key analysis areas:

- **Conflict Avoidance**: Hedging language, indirect phrasing, topic-shifting
- **Speaking Ratios**: Talk time percentage, interruption count,
  question-to-statement ratio
- **Filler Words**: "um", "uh", "like", "you know", "actually" frequency
- **Active Listening**: References, paraphrasing, clarifying questions
- **Leadership**: Decision-making approach, inclusion practices

### 4. Output Format

For each pattern:

```markdown
### [Pattern Name]

**Finding**: [One-sentence summary]
**Frequency**: [X times across Y meetings]

**Examples**:
1. **[Meeting Name/Date]** - [Timestamp]

   **What Happened**:
   > [Actual quote from transcript]

   **Why This Matters**:
   [Impact or missed opportunity explanation]

   **Better Approach**:
   [Specific alternative phrasing]
```

### 5. Synthesize Insights

```markdown
# Meeting Insights Summary

**Analysis Period**: [Date range]
**Meetings Analyzed**: [X meetings]
**Total Duration**: [X hours]

## Key Patterns

### 1. [Primary Pattern]
- **Observed**: [What was found]
- **Impact**: [Why it matters]
- **Recommendation**: [How to improve]

## Communication Strengths
1. [Strength + example]

## Growth Opportunities
1. **[Area]**: [Specific advice]

## Statistics
- Average speaking time: [X%]
- Questions asked: [X per meeting]
- Filler words: [X per minute]
- Interruptions: [X per meeting]
```

### 6. Offer Follow-Up Options

- Track same metrics in future meetings
- Deep dive into specific meetings or patterns
- Compare to previous periods
- Create personal development plan

## Usage Examples

```text
Analyze all meetings in this folder and tell me when I avoided conflict.
```

```text
Look at my meetings from the past month and identify my communication
patterns.
```

```text
Compare my Q1 vs Q2 meetings to see if my listening skills improved.
```

## Limitations

- Depends on transcript quality (cannot analyze audio directly)
- Text-only analysis misses tone, expressions, non-verbal cues
- Cultural communication differences need consideration
- Requires clear speaker identification for accurate analysis
