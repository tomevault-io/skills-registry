# C4 Architecture Documentation Skill

## Purpose

This skill ensures that all architectural changes in Black Trigram comply with the C4 Architecture Model and maintain comprehensive, up-to-date documentation across current and future architectural states.

## When to Apply

**Automatically trigger this skill when:**
- Adding new components, containers, or systems
- Modifying game architecture or data flow
- Implementing new features that affect system structure
- Refactoring existing architecture
- Planning future roadmap items
- Updating technical stack or dependencies

### 5. Common Architecture Anti-Patterns to REJECT

**Immediately flag and reject these patterns:**

❌ **Undocumented Architectural Changes**
```typescript
// BAD: Adding new system without updating ARCHITECTURE.md
// New grappling system added but not documented in C4 diagrams
export class GrapplingSystem { ... }
```

❌ **Incomplete C4 Diagrams**
```mermaid
# BAD: Missing relationships or actors
C4Context
    System(blackTrigram, "Black Trigram")
    # Missing Player actor, external systems, relationships
```

❌ **Out-of-Sync Documentation**
```markdown
<!-- BAD: ARCHITECTURE.md shows 8 stances but code implements 10 -->
## Trigram System
Black Trigram implements 8 traditional stances...
```

❌ **Missing Future Planning**
```markdown
<!-- BAD: Adding feature without updating FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md -->
## New VR Support
VR support implemented but no roadmap documentation.
```

❌ **Generic or Non-Specific Documentation**
```markdown
<!-- BAD: Vague descriptions without Korean context -->
## Combat System
The game has a combat system with attacks and defense.
# Missing: 70 vital points, 8 trigram stances, Korean terminology
```

### 6. Required Architecture Patterns

**Enforce these documentation patterns:**

✅ **Complete C4 System Context**
```mermaid
C4Context
    title System Context - Black Trigram (흑괘) Web Application (Q1 2026)

    Person(player, "🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Martial Arts Student", "Learns Korean vital point targeting with 70 anatomical points")
    Person(instructor, "🥋 Martial Arts Instructor", "Uses for teaching traditional Korean techniques")
    
    System(blackTrigram, "🌐 Black Trigram (흑괘)", "Korean martial arts combat simulator with 70 vital points, 8 trigram stances, 28-bone skeletal animation")
    
    System_Ext(audioCDN, "🎵 Audio CDN", "Korean traditional music + cyberpunk SFX")
    System_Ext(artCDN, "🖼️ Visual Assets CDN", "3D models, textures, particle effects")
    
    Rel(player, blackTrigram, "Practices combat techniques", "HTTPS/WebGL")
    Rel(blackTrigram, audioCDN, "Streams audio", "HTTPS")
    Rel(blackTrigram, artCDN, "Loads 3D assets", "HTTPS")
```

✅ **Detailed Container Relationships**
```mermaid
C4Container
    title Container View - Black Trigram Architecture

    Container(ui, "🖥️ React UI Layer", "React 19 + TypeScript", "Korean-themed components")
    Container(gameEngine, "⚙️ Game Logic Engine", "TypeScript", "Combat calculations, 70 vital points")
    Container(renderer, "🎨 Three.js Renderer", "@react-three/fiber", "60fps 3D graphics")
    
    Rel(ui, gameEngine, "Dispatches actions", "Function calls")
    Rel(gameEngine, renderer, "Updates visuals", "Three.js API")
```

✅ **Specific Metrics in SWOT**
```markdown
## Strengths ✅

```

## Enforcement Rules

### Rule 1: No Architectural Changes Without Documentation

```
IF (code change affects system architecture)
THEN (update ARCHITECTURE.md AND relevant C4 diagrams)
ELSE (reject the change)
```

### Rule 2: Current and Future States Must Sync

```
IF (FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md item is implemented)
THEN (move to ARCHITECTURE.md AND update SWOT metrics)
ELSE (maintain in future planning)
```

### Rule 3: All C4 Diagrams Must Be Valid Mermaid

```
IF (architectural diagram added or modified)
THEN (validate Mermaid syntax AND test rendering)
ELSE (fix syntax errors before approval)
```

### Rule 4: Korean Context Required for Martial Arts Systems

```
IF (combat or martial arts system added/modified)
THEN (include Korean names, philosophy, AND English translations)
ELSE (add cultural context before approval)
```

### Rule 5: Metrics Must Be Quantified

```
IF (SWOT or status updated)
THEN (provide specific numbers: X/Y complete, N% coverage)
ELSE (add quantifiable metrics)
```

### Rule 6: File Structure Reflects Architecture

```
IF (new component or system added)
THEN (place in correct directory AND document in File Structure section)
ELSE (reorganize to match architectural patterns)
```

## Architecture Quality Standards

### High-Quality Architecture Documentation Example

```markdown
## 🧩 Component View - Combat System

### Combat Engine (전투 엔진)

**Responsibility**: Orchestrate all combat interactions with anatomical precision.

**Components**:
- **Vital Point Targeting System (급소격 시스템)**
  - **Purpose**: 70 anatomical vital points with Korean/English/TCM names
  - **Implementation**: `src/systems/combat/vital-points/VitalPointSystem.ts`
  - **Data Model**: `src/systems/combat/vital-points/vital-points-data.ts`
  - **Korean Context**: Based on traditional 경혈 (Gyeonghyeol) acupoint theory
  - **Interfaces**:
    ```typescript
    interface VitalPoint {
      readonly id: string;
      readonly nameKorean: string;
      readonly nameEnglish: string;
      readonly nameTCM: string;
      readonly location: { x: number; y: number; z: number };
      readonly severity: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
      readonly effects: readonly DamageEffect[];
    }
    ```

- **Trigram Stance System (팔괘 자세 시스템)**
  - **Purpose**: 8 traditional I Ching stances with unique combat properties
  - **Implementation**: `src/systems/combat/stances/TrigramSystem.ts`
  - **Korean Philosophy**: Based on 주역 (Juyeok) / I Ching principles
  - **Performance**: <1ms stance transition time
  - **States**:
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        [*] --> Geon: Select Heaven
        [*] --> Tae: Select Lake
        Geon --> Tae: Transition
        Tae --> Li: Transition
        note right of Geon: 건 (Heaven)\nDirect force
        note right of Tae: 태 (Lake)\nFluid motion
    ```

**Performance Targets**:
- Combat calculation: <5ms per frame
- Vital point detection: <2ms per hit
- Stance transition: <1ms
- Total combat overhead: <10ms (maintains 60fps)

**Dependencies**:
- Three.js Renderer (for hit detection raycasting)
- Animation System (for skeletal animation coordination)
- Audio Engine (for damage-based sound feedback)

**Testing**:
- Unit tests: `src/systems/combat/__tests__/CombatSystem.test.ts`
- Coverage: 92%
- E2E tests: `cypress/e2e/combat-system.cy.ts`
```

### Low-Quality Architecture Documentation Example (REJECT)

```markdown
<!-- BAD: Vague, missing metrics, no Korean context, no code references -->

## Combat System

The combat system handles fighting. It has attacks and defense.
It uses some Korean martial arts concepts.

The system is fast and works well.

Implementation is in the combat folder.
```

**Why This Is Rejected**:
- ❌ No C4 diagram or architectural context
- ❌ No specific metrics (70 vital points, 8 stances)
- ❌ No Korean terminology or cultural context
- ❌ No performance targets or benchmarks
- ❌ No file paths or code examples
- ❌ No interfaces or data models
- ❌ No testing information
- ❌ Vague language ("fast", "works well")

   - Update DATA_MODEL.md with final interfaces

4. Review Phase:
   - Validate all Mermaid diagrams render
   - Ensure Korean context included
   - Verify performance targets met
   - Check test coverage meets standards
```

### When Refactoring Architecture

```
1. Assessment:
   - Document current state in ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Identify technical debt in SWOT.md
   - Plan refactoring in FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md

2. Execution:
   - Refactor code incrementally
   - Maintain test coverage >85%
   - Monitor performance continuously

3. Documentation:
   - Update C4 diagrams to reflect new structure
   - Update file structure documentation
   - Update component relationships
   - Remove technical debt from SWOT.md
```

## Remember

**Architecture documentation is the blueprint of Black Trigram. Every component, every system, every decision must be captured with precision and clarity.**

When documenting architecture:
1. **VISUALIZE** - Create clear C4 diagrams with Mermaid
2. **CONTEXTUALIZE** - Include Korean martial arts philosophy
3. **QUANTIFY** - Provide specific metrics and benchmarks
4. **IMPLEMENT** - Show actual code examples and file paths
5. **PLAN** - Document future evolution in FUTURE_* files
6. **VALIDATE** - Ensure documentation matches implementation
