# 🛡️ Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Skill

## Purpose

This skill enforces comprehensive security integration throughout the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for Black Trigram (흑괘), implementing Hack23 AB's [Secure Development Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Secure_Development_Policy.md). It covers all seven SDLC phases, DevSecOps automation, secure coding standards, supply chain security, and architecture documentation requirements.

**Core Reference**: [Hack23 ISMS Secure Development Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Secure_Development_Policy.md) (95KB comprehensive policy)

## When to Apply

**Automatically trigger this skill when:**
- 🛠️ Developing new features or components
- 🔍 Reviewing pull requests and code changes
- 🚀 Planning deployments or releases
- 🤖 Configuring CI/CD pipelines and automation
- 📋 Writing or updating security documentation
- 🔒 Implementing authentication, authorization, or cryptography
- 🛡️ Conducting security assessments or threat modeling
- 📊 Managing dependencies or supply chain
- 🔧 Refactoring or maintaining existing code
- 🗄️ Decommissioning features or systems

## Core Principles

### 1. 🛠️ Complete SDLC Phase Coverage

**ALWAYS implement security in ALL seven SDLC phases:**

| Phase | Key Activities | ISMS Reference |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Requirements | Security requirements, threat identification | Secure_Development_Policy §3.1 |
| 2. Design | Threat modeling (STRIDE), security architecture | Secure_Development_Policy §3.2 |
| 3. Implementation | Secure coding (OWASP Top 10, CWE Top 25), input validation | Secure_Development_Policy §3.3 |
| 4. Testing | Security testing (SAST, DAST, SCA), penetration testing | Secure_Development_Policy §3.4 |
| 5. Deployment | Secure configuration, signed artifacts, SBOM | Secure_Development_Policy §3.5 |
| 6. Maintenance | Vulnerability management, dependency updates, monitoring | Secure_Development_Policy §3.6 |
| 7. Retirement | Secure data disposal, access revocation, archival | Secure_Development_Policy §3.7 |

**Key Patterns:**
- Document security requirements with ISMS policy references
- Create STRIDE threat models for all new features
- Apply OWASP Top 10 prevention controls in implementation
- Run SAST (CodeQL), DAST, and SCA in CI/CD pipeline
- Sign releases and generate CycloneDX SBOM
- Monitor for vulnerabilities with Dependabot and npm audit
- Securely decommission with data disposal verification

### 2. 🤖 DevSecOps Automation (Complete Tool Integration)

**Integrate security automation into CI/CD:**

| Stage | Tools | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Pre-commit | ESLint security rules, type checking | Catch issues early |
| Build | npm audit, license check | Dependency security |
| Test | Vitest security tests, CodeQL SAST | Code vulnerability scanning |
| Deploy | SBOM generation, signed artifacts | Supply chain integrity |
| Monitor | Dependabot, OSSF Scorecard | Continuous vulnerability detection |

**CI/CD Pipeline:** `npm run check` → `npm run lint` → `npm test` → `npm audit` → `npm run build` → SBOM generation

### 3. 📋 Code Review Requirements

**Every PR must have:**
- Security-focused code review with checklist
- Input validation verification
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Proper error handling (no information leakage)
- TypeScript strict mode compliance (no `any`)
- Test coverage ≥90% with security test cases
- SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md updated for security changes

### 4. 🔒 Supply Chain Security (OSSF/SLSA)

**Supply chain security requirements:**
- OSSF Scorecard target ≥7.0 (aim for 10)
- SLSA Level 3 build provenance
- CycloneDX/SPDX SBOM for every release
- Dependabot enabled with auto-merge for patch updates
- Signed commits required for production branches
- Pin GitHub Actions to full SHA (not tags)
- Lock files committed and verified
- License compliance: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD only

## Anti-Patterns to REJECT

### ❌ Missing Threat Model
```typescript
// BAD: No threat model for authentication
const AuthProvider: React.FC = () => {
  // Implementation without threat analysis
};

// GOOD: Threat model documented
/**
 * JWT Authentication Provider
 * 
 * Threat Model: THREAT_MODEL.md#jwt-authentication
 * STRIDE Analysis:
 * - Spoofing: Mitigated by password strength + MFA (planned)
// ... (condensed)
```

### ❌ Hardcoded Secrets
```typescript
// BAD: Hardcoded API key
const API_KEY = 'sk_live_1234567890abcdef';

// GOOD: Environment variable
const API_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY;

// BEST: AWS Secrets Manager (future)
const API_KEY = await getSecret('blacktrigram/api-key');
```

### ❌ Unvalidated User Input
```typescript
// BAD: No validation
function calculateDamage(damage: number) {
  return damage * 1.5;
}

// GOOD: Zod validation
const DamageSchema = z.number().int().positive().max(9999);

function calculateDamage(damage: unknown) {
  const validated = DamageSchema.parse(damage);
  return validated * 1.5;
}
```

### ❌ Missing Security Tests
```typescript
// BAD: Only happy path testing
describe('Combat System', () => {
  it('calculates damage correctly', () => {
    expect(calculateDamage(50, 30)).toBe(20);
  });
});

// GOOD: Security test cases included
describe('Combat System Security', () => {
  it('rejects negative damage values', () => {
    expect(() => calculateDamage(-10, 30)).toThrow();
  });
// ... (condensed)
```

### ❌ Insufficient Cryptography
```typescript
// BAD: Weak encryption
function encrypt(data: string): string {
  return btoa(data); // Base64 is encoding, not encryption!
}

// GOOD: Strong cryptography
async function encrypt(data: string, key: CryptoKey): Promise<ArrayBuffer> {
  const iv = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12));
  const encoded = new TextEncoder().encode(data);
  
  return await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
    { name: 'AES-GCM', iv },
// ... (condensed)
```

### ❌ Insecure Deserialization
```typescript
// BAD: Using eval
function deserialize(json: string): unknown {
  return eval(`(${json})`); // NEVER DO THIS
}

// GOOD: Safe JSON parsing with validation
function deserialize<T>(json: string, schema: z.ZodSchema<T>): T {
  const parsed = JSON.parse(json);
  return schema.parse(parsed);
}
```

### ❌ Missing Security Headers
```html
<!-- BAD: No security headers -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Black Trigram</title>
  </head>
</html>

<!-- GOOD: Comprehensive security headers -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
// ... (condensed)
```

### ❌ Unsigned Commits in Production
```bash
# BAD: Unsigned commit
git commit -m "Add authentication"
git push origin main

# GOOD: Signed commit
git config --global commit.gpgSign true
git commit -S -m "Add authentication"
git push origin main
```

### ❌ Missing SBOM
```yaml
# BAD: Deploy without SBOM
- name: Deploy
  run: npm run deploy

# GOOD: Generate SBOM before deploy
- name: Generate SBOM
  run: npx @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm --output-file sbom.json

- name: Attest SBOM
  uses: actions/attest@59d89421af93a897026c735860bf21b6eb4f7b26 # v4.1.0
  with:
    subject-path: 'dist/'
# ... (condensed)
```

### ❌ No Incident Response Plan
```typescript
// BAD: No security incident handling
function detectAnomalousActivity(event: Event) {
  console.log('Weird event', event);
}

// GOOD: Security incident response
function detectAnomalousActivity(event: Event) {
  const logger = new SecurityLogger();
  
  logger.logSuspiciousActivity({
    type: 'ANOMALOUS_BEHAVIOR',
    severity: 'HIGH',
// ... (condensed)
```

## Required Patterns

### ✅ Complete SDLC Documentation
```typescript
/**
 * Every feature MUST document all SDLC phases.
 * 
 * Example: Korean martial arts combat system
 */
interface FeatureSDLCDocumentation {
  readonly feature: string;
  
  // Phase 1: Requirements
  readonly requirements: SecurityRequirements;
  readonly threatModel: ThreatModel;
  
// ... (condensed)
```

### ✅ Comprehensive CI/CD Security Integration
```yaml
# All security tools integrated in CI/CD
name: Complete Security Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  # SAST
  codeql: ...
  
  # SCA
  npm-audit: ...
  snyk: ...
// ... (condensed)
```

### ✅ Defense in Depth Security Architecture
```typescript
/**
 * Multiple layers of security controls.
 */
interface DefenseInDepthArchitecture {
  readonly layers: SecurityLayer[];
}

const combatSystemDefenseInDepth: DefenseInDepthArchitecture = {
  layers: [
    // Layer 1: Network Security
    {
      name: 'Network',
// ... (condensed)
```

## Korean Philosophy Integration

### 보안 내재화 (Boan Naejae-hwa) - Security Built-In

**Core SDLC Principle:**

Security is not added later—it is **woven into every phase** of development, like the threads in traditional Korean hanbok fabric (한복). Each thread is essential; remove one and the garment unravels.

**Korean SDLC Philosophy:**

1. **선견지명 (Seongyeonjimyeong - Foresight)** - Requirements & Design
   - Anticipate threats before they materialize
   - Design defenses into the foundation
   - Like a strategic go (바둑) player thinking 20 moves ahead

2. **견고함 (Gyeonggoham - Robustness)** - Implementation
   - Build with strength through secure coding
   - Multiple layers like fortress walls (성곽)
   - Defense in depth, not surface protection

3. **검증 (Geomjeung - Verification)** - Testing
   - Test thoroughly like a master craftsman inspects pottery (도자기)
   - Every line of code examined for flaws
   - Security tests as rigorous as martial arts training

4. **지속성 (Jisokseong - Continuity)** - Maintenance
   - Continuous vigilance like a palace guard
   - Regular updates and patching
   - Never assume safety; always verify

5. **정리정돈 (Jeongnijeongdon - Order)** - Retirement
   - Clean, orderly decommissioning
   - Respect for data like respect for elders
   - Secure destruction, documented and verified

### 삼위일체 보안 (Samwi-ilche Boan) - Trinity of Security

**The Three Pillars of Secure Development:**

1. **예방 (Yebang - Prevention)**
   - Secure coding standards
   - Input validation
   - OWASP Top 10 controls

2. **탐지 (Tamji - Detection)**
   - Security testing (SAST, DAST, SCA)
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Anomaly detection

3. **대응 (Daeung - Response)**
   - Incident response planning
   - Vulnerability remediation
   - Continuous improvement

**Like the three kingdoms of ancient Korea (삼국시대), all three must be strong for security to endure.**

## Remember

**Security is a continuous journey, not a destination.**

When implementing Secure SDLC:

1. **REQUIREMENTS** - Identify threats before writing code
2. **DESIGN** - Build security into architecture
3. **IMPLEMENT** - Follow secure coding standards
4. **TEST** - Verify security with comprehensive tests
5. **DEPLOY** - Use secure configuration and secrets management
6. **MAINTAIN** - Patch vulnerabilities promptly
7. **RETIRE** - Decommission securely with data destruction

**Every line of code is a security decision.**

**흑괘의 보안을 지켜라** - _Protect the Security of the Black Trigram_
