# AI Development Governance Skill

## Context

This skill applies when:
- Using GitHub Copilot or other AI coding assistants
- Reviewing AI-generated code
- Implementing AI-augmented development workflows
- Creating custom Copilot agents and skills
- Securing AI/LLM integrations
- Documenting AI usage in development process

This skill enforces **[Hack23 Secure Development Policy Section 🤖](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Secure_Development_Policy.md#ai-augmented-development-controls)** for responsible AI-assisted development.

## Rules

### 1. AI as Proposal Generator, Not Authority (Policy Section 🤖.1)

1. **Human Review Required**: All AI-generated code MUST be reviewed by human developer
2. **Understanding Required**: Developer MUST understand what AI-generated code does
3. **No Blind Acceptance**: Never merge AI suggestions without verification
4. **Test AI Code**: All AI-generated code requires tests with 80%+ coverage
5. **Security Review**: AI-generated security code requires additional security review

### 2. PR Review Requirements (Policy Section 🤖.2)

6. **AI Disclosure**: PRs with significant AI-generated code MUST be labeled
7. **Code Ownership**: Developer submitting PR owns the code, regardless of AI generation
8. **Review Standards**: Same review standards apply to AI-generated and human-written code
9. **Security Validation**: Security-critical AI code requires security team approval
10. **No Bypass**: AI assistance does NOT reduce review requirements

### 3. Curator-Agent as Tooling Change (Policy Section 🤖.3)

11. **Agent Purpose**: Custom agents provide specialized expertise, not replace human judgment
12. **Skill Integration**: Skills teach patterns, developers validate appropriateness
13. **Agent Transparency**: Document which agents/skills were used
14. **Agent Limitations**: Understand agent limitations and potential biases
15. **Agent Testing**: Test agent-generated code as rigorously as any other code

### 4. Security Requirements (Policy Section 🤖.4)

16. **No Secrets in Prompts**: Never include secrets, API keys, or credentials in AI prompts
17. **Data Classification**: Don't share classified or sensitive data with AI
18. **Code Review**: AI-generated security controls require expert security review
19. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Run CodeQL/SAST on all AI-generated code
20. **ISMS Compliance**: AI-generated code MUST comply with all ISMS policies

## Examples

### ✅ Good Pattern: AI-Generated Code with Proper Review

export class EPAPIRateLimiter {
  // Implementation...
}
```

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Bad: Blindly Accepting AI Code

```typescript
// GitHub Copilot suggested this - looks good, merging!
export async function handleUserData(data: any) {
  return await processData(data);  // No validation!
}
```

**Why**: Violates AI Development Governance - no review, no validation, no tests

### ❌ Bad: Including Secrets in AI Prompts

```
Prompt to Copilot: "Create API client with API key abc123xyz456"
```

**Why**: Violates Policy Section 🤖.4 - Never share secrets with AI

### ❌ Bad: No AI Disclosure

```markdown
# Pull Request

Changed the search function.
```

**Why**: Violates transparency - significant AI-generated code must be disclosed
