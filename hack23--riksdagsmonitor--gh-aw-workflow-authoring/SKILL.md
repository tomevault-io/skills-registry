# ✍️ GitHub Agentic Workflows - Workflow Authoring Skill

## 📋 Purpose

Master the art of authoring **GitHub Agentic Workflows** - creating AI-powered automation using natural language markdown instead of complex YAML. This skill provides comprehensive expertise in workflow design, natural language instructions, configuration, and best practices for effective agentic automation.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### What Makes Agentic Workflows Different?

**Traditional GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
# Complex conditional logic
if: |
  contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'bug') &&
  !contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'wontfix') &&
  github.event.issue.state == 'open'
run: echo "Process bug"
```

**Agentic Workflow:**
```markdown
If this is an open bug that should be fixed, provide helpful triage information.
```

**Key Differences:**

| Traditional Actions | Agentic Workflows |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| ✅ Deterministic | 🤖 AI-driven decisions |
| ⚙️ Complex YAML | 📝 Natural language |
| 🔧 Fixed logic paths | 🧠 Context-aware responses |
| 📊 Explicit conditionals | 💡 Inferred intent |

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### Concurrency Control

```yaml
---
on: issues

concurrency:
  group: issue-${{ github.event.issue.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
---
```

**Use Cases:**
- Prevent duplicate processing
- Cancel outdated runs
- Resource management

### Conditional Execution

```yaml
---
on: pull_request

if: |
  github.event.pull_request.draft == false &&
  !contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'skip-review')
---
```

### Timeouts

```yaml
---
timeout-minutes: 5  # Cancel if exceeds 5 minutes
---
```

### Environment Variables

```yaml
---
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '24'
  DEBUG: 'true'
---
```

## 🔄 Compilation Process

### Manual Compilation

```bash
# Install compiler
npm install -g @github/agentic-workflows-compiler

# Compile workflow
aw-compile .github/workflows/issue-triage.md

# Output: .github/workflows/issue-triage.lock.yml
```

### Automatic Compilation

**GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
name: Compile Agentic Workflows

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/*.md'

jobs:
  compile:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Compile Workflows
        run: |
          npm install -g @github/agentic-workflows-compiler
          aw-compile .github/workflows/*.md
      
      - name: Commit Compiled Files
        run: |
          git add .github/workflows/*.lock.yml
          git commit -m "Compile agentic workflows"
          git push
```

### Validation

```bash
# Validate syntax
aw-validate .github/workflows/issue-triage.md

# Check for common issues
aw-lint .github/workflows/issue-triage.md
```

## 🎨 Best Practices

### 1. Single Responsibility

❌ **Bad: Multiple tasks in one workflow**
```markdown
Triage issues, review PRs, update documentation, and manage dependencies.
```

✅ **Good: Focused workflow**
```markdown
Triage new issues by analyzing content, checking for duplicates, and applying appropriate labels.
```

### 2. Clear Success Criteria

❌ **Bad: Vague instructions**
```markdown
Make this better.
```

✅ **Good: Specific criteria**
```markdown
Improve this code by:
- Reducing cyclomatic complexity to <10
- Adding error handling for edge cases
- Including unit tests with 80%+ coverage
```

### 3. Tool Minimalism

❌ **Bad: Grant all tools**
```yaml
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: ['*']
  bash:
  safeoutputs___*:
```

✅ **Good: Only required tools**
```yaml
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues]
  safeoutputs___comment:
```

### 4. Error Guidance

```markdown
If you encounter issues:
1. Check for existing similar issues first
2. If API rate limit reached, note it and suggest trying later
3. If insufficient permissions, explain what's needed
4. Always provide fallback recommendations
```

### 5. Testing Instructions

```markdown
Before implementation:
1. Validate file paths exist
2. Check for required permissions
3. Verify tool availability
4. Test with dry-run if possible

Use safeoutputs___noop to report findings if validation fails.
```

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Overly Complex Instructions

❌ **Don't:**
```markdown
Analyze code considering 27 different quality metrics, cross-reference with 15 different documentation sources, generate detailed reports with statistical analysis, create visualization dashboards, and...
```

✅ **Do:**
```markdown
Focus on 3 key areas:
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Test coverage
3. Code complexity

Provide actionable feedback for each.
```

### Pitfall 2: Assuming Tool Availability

❌ **Don't:**
```markdown
Use bash to run npm install...
```

✅ **Do:**
```yaml
---
tools:
  bash:
    allowed-commands: [npm]
---

If npm is available, run npm install to verify dependencies.
```

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Rate Limits

❌ **Don't:**
```markdown
Search all 10,000 issues for duplicates.
```

✅ **Do:**
```markdown
Search recent issues (last 90 days) for duplicates.
If none found, note that older issues weren't checked due to performance.
```

### Pitfall 4: Not Handling Failures

❌ **Don't:**
```markdown
Update the file with new content.
```

✅ **Do:**
```markdown
Attempt to update the file.
If it fails (permissions, file doesn't exist, etc.):
- Use safeoutputs___noop to explain the issue
- Suggest manual resolution steps
```

## 🆕 v0.45.5 Features

### AI Engine Selection

Specify the engine in frontmatter or let `gh aw compile` choose the default:

```markdown
---
engine:
  id: copilot                      # Repo convention: use Copilot engine, select model via `model`
  model: claude-3-5-sonnet         # Engine-specific model identifier (e.g. claude-opus-4.6)
timeout-minutes: 5
---
```

### Integrity Filtering

Control who can trigger workflows in public repositories:

```markdown
---
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues, labels]
    min-integrity: approved  # Only collaborators+ (default)
    # min-integrity: none    # Allow all users (for public triage)
---
```

### Threat Detection

Every workflow automatically includes threat detection. The dedicated scan checks agent outputs for:
- Prompt injection attacks
- Leaked credentials
- Malicious code patterns

If suspicious content is found, the workflow fails immediately and nothing is written.

### Cross-Repository Workflows

```markdown
---
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
    target-repo: owner/other-repo  # Cross-repo PRs
---
```

### Workflow Commands (Slash Commands)

Trigger workflows from issue/PR comments:

```markdown
---
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
    command: /plan   # Triggers on `/plan` comments
---
```

## 🏭 Agent Factory Patterns (Best Practices from github/gh-aw)

### High-Impact Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example Merge Rate |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Plan Command** | `/plan` decomposes issues into sub-tasks | 67% (514/761 PRs) |
| **Discussion Task Miner** | Extracts tasks from discussion threads | 57% (60/105 PRs) |
| **Code Simplifier** | Daily incremental code improvements | Continuous |
| **Issue Triage Agent** | Auto-labels and comments on new issues | Event-driven |

### Scheduling Best Practices

**Prefer fuzzy schedules** over fixed cron to distribute workflow execution times and reduce load spikes:

```markdown
---
on:
  schedule: daily on weekdays              # Recommended: Mon-Fri, auto-distributed
  schedule: daily around 9:00 on weekdays  # With approximate time hint
  schedule: weekly on friday around 7:00   # Weekly with day and time
  schedule: every 6 hours                  # Periodic interval
---
```

The compiler converts fuzzy schedules to deterministic cron expressions, scattering execution times automatically. This avoids the "Monday wall of work" problem where weekend tasks pile up.

**Use fixed cron only when** the exact time matters (e.g., monthly runs on specific dates):

```markdown
---
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 8 1 * *"    # 1st of month — no fuzzy equivalent
    - cron: "0 10 28 * *"  # 28th of month
---
```

Stagger schedules to avoid resource contention. Use `timeout-minutes: 5` for quick tasks, `timeout-minutes: 45` for complex analysis.

### Cross-Run Memory Patterns

gh-aw provides three built-in memory mechanisms (prefer these over `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` which is ephemeral per run):

| Mechanism | Persistence | Scope | Use Case |
|-----------|------------|-------|----------|
| `repo-memory:` | Git-backed, permanent | Cross-workflow via shared branch | Shared state across workflows (e.g., dedup indexes, quality scores) |
| `cache-memory:` | GitHub Actions cache, ~7 days | Per-workflow or shared via key | Session state, intermediate results |
| `cache:` | GitHub Actions cache | Per-workflow | Dependencies, build artifacts |

**Recommended: `repo-memory:`** for cross-workflow context:
```yaml
tools:
  repo-memory:
    branch-name: memory/my-project
    allowed-extensions: [".md", ".json"]
    max-file-size: 10240
    max-file-count: 100
```

**Avoid:** `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` — dies when the process ends, lost every run. Also skip `@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` — Claude has native CoT reasoning; it wastes context tokens.
