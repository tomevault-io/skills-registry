# System Design Patterns

## Decision Frameworks

Architecture is decisions. Good architects make them explicitly.

### When Monolith vs Services

Start monolith. Split only when you have evidence for ALL three:
1. **Independent deployment need**: teams ship on different cadences
2. **Independent scaling need**: one component needs 10x the resources
3. **Fault isolation need**: one component's failure must not cascade

If you can't name the specific component for all three, stay monolith. "Microservices for flexibility" is a premature abstraction.

### When SQL vs NoSQL

| Signal | Choose SQL | Choose NoSQL |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Data has relationships | Yes — joins are free | No — you'll denormalize anyway |
| Schema is evolving rapidly | Migrations are friction | Schema-less helps |
| Need transactions across entities | ACID is a feature | Distributed transactions are pain |
| Read pattern is "get by key" | Overkill | Document/KV stores excel |
| Write volume is extreme | Sharding SQL is hard | Built for horizontal scale |
| Need full-text search | Bolted on (fine for most) | Elasticsearch/dedicated |

Default: Postgres. It handles 90% of workloads. Add specialized stores when Postgres can't.

### When Sync vs Async

- **Sync** (request/response): when the caller needs the result to continue
- **Async** (queue/event): when the work can happen later or the caller doesn't need the result
- **Hybrid**: sync for the user-facing response, async for side effects (email, analytics, notifications)

Rule: if the user is waiting, be sync. If the user doesn't care when it happens, be async.

### When to Cache

Cache when ALL of these are true:
1. Data is read far more than written (>10:1 ratio)
2. Data can be stale for some period without harm
3. Computing/fetching the data is expensive
4. You have a clear invalidation strategy

No invalidation strategy = no cache. Stale data bugs are worse than slow responses.

## Architectural Review Checklist

When reviewing a system design or plan:

### 1. Boundaries
- Are service/module boundaries at natural domain seams?
- Does each component have a single reason to change?
- Are boundaries enforced (API contracts, not shared databases)?

### 2. Data Flow
- Trace a request from user to storage and back. How many hops?
- Where does data transform? Is validation at the boundary?
- Are there circular dependencies?

### 3. Failure Modes
- What happens when each dependency is down?
- Is there retry logic? Is it idempotent?
- What's the blast radius of the most likely failure?
- Are there circuit breakers where needed?

### 4. Scale Bottlenecks
- What's the first thing that breaks at 10x load?
- Are there N+1 patterns (queries, API calls, file reads)?
- Is there a single writer bottleneck?
- Can the hot path be cached or precomputed?

### 5. Coupling
- Can you deploy component A without redeploying B?
- Can you test component A without standing up B?
- If you change A's internal implementation, does B break?
- Are shared libraries creating hidden coupling?

### 6. Security Surface
- Is auth at the edge or scattered through the codebase?
- Are secrets in config, not code?
- Is the principle of least privilege applied (services, DB users, IAM roles)?

## Common Architectural Mistakes

### Distributed Monolith
Services that must be deployed together, share a database, or fail together. You got the complexity of microservices with none of the benefits. Fix: merge them back or establish real boundaries.

### Premature Abstraction
Building a "plugin system" for one plugin. Creating an "event bus" for two events. Writing a "generic data layer" before you have two data sources. Fix: inline it. Abstract when you have three concrete examples.

### Shared Database
Two services reading/writing the same tables. Any schema change requires coordinating both teams. Fix: each service owns its data. Expose via API, not shared tables.

### Synchronous Chain
A -> B -> C -> D, all synchronous. Latency is the sum. Failure in D fails A. Fix: go async where the user doesn't need an immediate result. Add timeouts and fallbacks.

### God Service
One service that "orchestrates everything." It knows about every other service. It's the bottleneck for every change. Fix: distribute decision-making. Each service handles its own domain logic.

## Scalability Analysis

When asked "will this scale?", work through:

1. **Identify the hot path**: what gets called most? (usually <5% of code handles >95% of traffic)
2. **Measure, don't guess**: profile before optimizing
3. **Scale reads and writes separately**: reads are usually cacheable, writes usually aren't
4. **Look for state**: stateless components scale horizontally. Stateful ones need coordination.
5. **Check the database**: it's almost always the bottleneck. Indexes, query plans, connection pools.
