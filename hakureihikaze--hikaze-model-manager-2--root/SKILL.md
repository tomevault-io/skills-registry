# Root

## Overview

Use this skill to govern Codex project work for Hikaze-Model-Manager-2 using the .codex directory structure, keeping immutable sources of truth stable while tracking jobs and design details.

## Sources of truth and load order

1. Read `.codex/constitution/` for project principles, tech stack, and code standards.
2. Read `.codex/workflows/` for the static workflow framework.
3. Read `.codex/guidelines/` for implementation details and decisions.
4. Read `.codex/jobs/activated.md` and the active job file to understand current work.

## Hard rules

- Do not edit `.codex/constitution/` or `.codex/workflows/` unless the user explicitly requests changes.
- Propose suggestions for constitution/workflows only; do not modify without explicit user instruction.
- Record new or changed design details in `.codex/guidelines/` during design discussions.
- Record designed but not implemented items in `.codex/guidelines/not_implemented.md`.
- Keep all .codex content in Markdown.
- When stating code or behavior facts, cite evidence (file path + line or command output); avoid assumptions.
- Use a single file per job to carry phases and tasks.
- The last task of every phase must be user manual verification.
- Track branches as indented checklist items; complete same-indent branch items before returning to the parent flow.
- Update `.codex/jobs/activated.md` whenever the active job changes.
- If required .codex paths are missing, ask before creating them.

## Job file format

Use `jobs/<job>/<job>.md` with Markdown checklists:

```markdown
# Job: <job-name>

## Phase 1: <phase-name>
- [ ] Task: <task>
  - [ ] Branch: <subtask>
  - [ ] Branch: <subtask>
- [ ] Quality Gates
  - [ ] Build passes (if applicable)
  - [ ] Evidence recorded (file refs / command output)
  - [ ] Docs updated (if needed)
- [ ] User manual verification

## Phase 2: <phase-name>
- [ ] Task: <task>
- [ ] Quality Gates
  - [ ] Build passes (if applicable)
  - [ ] Evidence recorded (file refs / command output)
  - [ ] Docs updated (if needed)
- [ ] User manual verification
```

## Workflow usage

- Treat workflows as the static guidance framework that governs each job and phase.
- Record workflow branches in the job file as indented checklists.
- Return to the parent flow after all items at the branch indent are complete.

## Sub-skills

Use specialized skills to reduce context and improve precision when scope is narrow:

- `hikaze-frontend`: Vue/TypeScript/CSS UI work in `web/model_manager_frontend` or `web/custom_node_frontend`.
- `hikaze-backend`: Python nodes and server work in `nodes/` or `backend/`.
- `hikaze-api`: API contracts, request/response changes, and frontend-backend integration.

## Conductor migration (only if requested)

Migrate prompts from `custom_nodes/Hikaze-Model-Manager-2/conductor/` to `.codex/` only when the user asks:

- `conductor/product.md` -> `.codex/constitution/product.md`
- `conductor/tech-stack.md` -> `.codex/constitution/tech-stack.md`
- `conductor/code_styleguides/*` -> `.codex/constitution/code_styleguides/*`
- `conductor/workflow.md` -> `.codex/workflows/default.md`
- `conductor/product-guidelines.md` -> `.codex/guidelines/product-guidelines.md`
- `conductor/archive/*` -> `.codex/jobs/archive/*`
- Do not migrate `conductor/discrepancies/*` unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Language policy

Accept any input language. Choose output language by accuracy first, then token efficiency.
