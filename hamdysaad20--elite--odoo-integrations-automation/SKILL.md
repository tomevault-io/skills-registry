# Odoo Integrations & Automations (Odoo 18)

## Scope

Use this skill to design, implement, and troubleshoot:
- **Automations inside Odoo**: server actions, scheduled actions (cron), automated workflows, emails/activities, approval flows.
- **Integrations with external systems**: Odoo APIs (JSON-RPC / XML-RPC), inbound/outbound webhooks, iPaaS workflows, and custom services.
- **Custom development**: new Odoo modules, ORM model changes, security, performance, deployment/upgrade considerations.

Assume **Odoo 18** by default. The environment may be **mixed** (Odoo Online, Odoo.sh, on‑prem). Always branch guidance based on hosting constraints.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Investigate first**: read the repo’s existing Odoo integration code and docs before proposing changes.
2. **No demo/placeholder implementations**: use real patterns, types, and conventions from the codebase.
3. **Verify with official Odoo docs**:
   - If anything depends on version/edition/module, do a quick web lookup and cite the relevant Odoo doc pages.
   - Prefer official docs first, then reputable Odoo community sources if needed.
4. **Security and correctness first**: treat integration points as production-grade (auth, least privilege, idempotency, retries, audit logs).

## Quick decision tree

### 1) Where should the automation live?

- **Inside Odoo** (best when data + workflow are Odoo-native):
  - Server actions / automated actions
  - Scheduled actions (cron)
  - Mail/activity automations
- **Outside Odoo** (best when integrating multiple systems or needing scale/observability):
  - A dedicated integration service (queue + retries)
  - iPaaS (Zapier/Make) only for low-risk, low-volume flows

### 2) Hosting constraints (must ask/confirm)

- **Odoo Online (SaaS)**: limited code-level customization; prefer Odoo features + supported connectors.
- **Odoo.sh**: supports custom modules; CI/buildpack constraints; manage secrets carefully.
- **On-prem**: full control; must manage upgrades, workers, queues, reverse proxy, and security hardening.

### 3) Integration style

- **Outbound from Odoo**:
  - webhooks (if available) or cron + polling
  - message queue patterns (if you control infra)
- **Inbound to Odoo**:
  - call Odoo APIs (JSON-RPC/XML-RPC) from external service
  - avoid direct DB writes; use ORM via RPC

## Implementation workflow (use this every time)

### Step 0 — Gather requirements (ask these questions)

- **Business goal**: what user action or business event triggers it?
- **Source of truth**: which system owns each field?
- **Data model**: which Odoo model(s) and fields are involved (e.g., partners, products, orders, invoices, pickings)?
- **Volume/latency**: expected throughput and acceptable delay.
- **Failure semantics**:
  - must it be **exactly-once**, **at-least-once**, or **best-effort**?
  - what’s the rollback / compensation strategy?
- **Hosting**: Online vs Odoo.sh vs on‑prem, and any compliance constraints.

### Step 1 — Trace existing code and conventions in this repo

Before designing anything new:
- Locate existing Odoo client/service code, job/queue logic, retry/backoff, and error taxonomy.
- Confirm how secrets are configured (env vars, vault), and how logs/audits are recorded.

### Step 2 — Choose a minimal, robust architecture

Default best practice for production integrations:
- **Idempotent writes** (dedupe keys, external IDs, unique constraints where applicable)
- **Queued processing** with retries and DLQ-like behavior (or “failed jobs” table)
- **Observability**: structured logs + correlation IDs + metrics
- **Backpressure**: rate limits and concurrency controls

### Step 3 — Odoo module best practices (when writing custom code)

- **Models**: use ORM cleanly; keep methods small; avoid side effects in computed fields.
- **Transactions**: understand commit boundaries; don’t rely on implicit commits.
- **Security**:
  - define **ACLs** and **record rules**
  - use `sudo()` only when justified and documented
  - never expose sensitive fields in controllers
- **Performance**:
  - batch reads/writes; minimize chatter
  - prefetch intelligently; avoid N+1 patterns
  - avoid heavy work in request/compute; offload to cron/queue when possible
- **Upgrades**:
  - prefer stable extension points (inherit models/views)
  - avoid monkey-patching core unless unavoidable

### Step 4 — Integration API best practices (when calling Odoo)

- Prefer **JSON-RPC** (typical for Odoo web) or **XML-RPC** (common for external integrations) based on existing codebase patterns.
- Always implement:
  - **timeouts**
  - **retry with jitter** (bounded)
  - **idempotency keys** (or external IDs mapped to Odoo records)
  - **rate limiting** / concurrency caps
  - **schema validation** on inbound payloads

### Step 5 — Testing & rollout

- Add tests appropriate to the layer:
  - module tests (Odoo test framework) for Odoo-side logic
  - unit/integration tests for external service (mock RPC, record/replay)
- Rollout plan:
  - migration/initial sync strategy
  - backfill and reconciliation scripts
  - feature flags / staged enablement

## Output format (always produce this)

When responding, format your result as:

```markdown
## Summary
- Goal:
- Proposed approach (inside Odoo / outside Odoo / hybrid):

## Current codebase findings
- Existing entry points:
- Existing conventions (client, retries, logging, queue):

## Design

3.

## Test plan
- Unit:
- Integration:
- Rollout:

## References (official docs)
- [Title](link)
```

## Official docs lookup (how to verify “latest”)

When details may vary (edition/module/version), do a web lookup and cite the exact pages used:
- Odoo Developer Documentation (ORM, security, controllers, testing)
- Odoo External API docs (JSON-RPC / XML-RPC usage patterns)
- Odoo.sh documentation (deployment constraints)

Do not rely on memory for version-specific behavior—verify first.
