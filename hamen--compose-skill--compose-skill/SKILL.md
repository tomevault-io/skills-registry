# Jetpack Compose Audit

This skill audits Android Jetpack Compose repositories with a strict, evidence-based report.

**Skill version:** 4.2.0 — released 2026-06-17. **Compose track:** Kotlin 2.0.20+ / Compose Compiler 1.5.4+ (Strong Skipping Mode default). See the README changelog for what changed.

It is intentionally focused on four categories:

- Performance
- State management
- Side effects
- Composable API quality

This skill does **not** score design or Material 3 compliance in v1. If the audit surfaces likely design-system problems, recommend a follow-up audit with the `material-3` skill (reference implementation: <https://github.com/hamen/material-3-skill>).

Testing, focus/keyboard navigation, and Compose Multiplatform are **coverage notes**, not score categories. Map those surfaces when present, flag obvious risk, and recommend the focused `compose-agent` references (`testing`, `focus`, `kmp`) as follow-up work. Do not fold them into the 0-100 score unless the same root cause clearly affects one of the four scored categories.

Android launch UX resources are also adjacent coverage, not a score category. Always scan splash-screen theme resources; if Android 12+ could render a static splash icon blurry, include it as an `Android Launch UX` finding and allow it into `Critical Findings` / `Prioritized Fixes` when the evidence is concrete.

## Out Of Scope In v1

Owned and deliberate scope choices — call out the limitation in the report rather than silently producing thin coverage:

- Material 3 compliance, theming, color/typography tokens — defer to the `material-3` skill.
- Accessibility scoring (`semantics`, content descriptions, touch-target sizing) — flag obvious gaps as a note, do not score.
- UI test coverage and Compose test rule patterns — note presence/absence, do not score; recommend `compose-agent focus on testing` for deeper review.
- Compose Multiplatform-specific rules (`expect`/`actual`, target-specific code paths) — note surface area and obvious platform-boundary risk; recommend `compose-agent focus on kmp` for deeper review.
- Wear OS / TV / Auto / Glance surfaces — note obvious focus / keyboard / D-pad risk; recommend `compose-agent focus on focus` for deeper review.
- Build performance (incremental compilation, KSP/KAPT choice).

If the user explicitly asks for any of these, narrow the scope and state it in the report.

## When To Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- audit a Jetpack Compose repository
- review Compose architecture or quality
- rate a codebase with scores
- inspect recomposition, state, or effects issues
- identify Compose best-practice violations in an existing repo

Typical trigger phrases:

- "audit this Compose repo"
- "score this Jetpack Compose codebase"
- "review state hoisting and side effects"
- "check Compose performance"
- "rate this repository"

## Expected Output

Produce both:

- a repository report file named `COMPOSE-AUDIT-REPORT.md`
- a short chat summary with the overall score, category scores, worst issues, and the top fixes

## Audit Principles

- Be strict, but evidence-based.
- Do not score from search hits alone. Read representative files before judging a category.
- Cite concrete file paths in the report for every important deduction.
- **Cite an official documentation URL for every deduction.** No "trust me" findings — the rubric maps every rule to a canonical source in `references/canonical-sources.md`. The report template requires a `References:` line per finding.
- Prefer canonical Android guidance over folklore.
- Treat performance as important, but not as the only lens.
- Do not punish app code for failing public-library purity tests. Apply API-quality checks mainly to reusable internal components, design-system pieces, and shared UI building blocks.
- Reserve `0-3` scores for repeated or systemic problems, not isolated mistakes.
- Do not award `9-10` unless the repo is consistently strong across the category.

## Process

### 1. Confirm Scope

Identify the target path:

- If the user passed an explicit path (`[repo path or module path]`), use it.
- If no path was passed, default to the current working directory.
- If the path does not exist, ask the user to clarify.

Before mapping modules, confirm Compose is actually present (fast-fail):

- grep for `androidx.compose` in any `build.gradle*` or `libs.versions.toml`
- grep for `setContent {` or `@Composable` under `src/`

If neither shows up, stop and report that the target is out of scope. Do not run a full module map first.

If Compose is present *only* in `samples/`, `demos/`, or test sources (no production usage), narrow the scope to those directories, set confidence to `Low`, and state in the report that the audit is over sample code rather than production paths. Do not score production-quality categories against demo code.

### 2. Map The Repository

Before scoring, identify:

- Gradle modules
- Android app and feature modules
- likely Compose source roots
- shared UI/component packages
- theme or design-system packages
- state holder or ViewModel areas
- test and preview locations
- UI test, screenshot test, focus/keyboard test, and semantics-test locations
- baseline-profile related modules or config if present
- KMP / Compose Multiplatform source sets (`commonMain`, `androidMain`, `iosMain`, `desktopMain`, `wasmJsMain`) if present
- Android splash-screen themes and drawable resources (`res/values*/themes.xml`, `styles.xml`, `drawable-v31`) if present

### 3. Build A Compose Surface Map

Look for:

- `@Composable` functions
- reusable UI components
- screens and routes
- `ViewModel` usage
- `remember`, `rememberSaveable`, `mutableStateOf`
- `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`, `collectAsState`
- `LaunchedEffect`, `DisposableEffect`, `SideEffect`, `rememberUpdatedState`, `produceState`
- `LazyColumn`, `LazyRow`, `items`, `itemsIndexed`
- animation APIs: `animate*AsState`, `Animatable`, `updateTransition`, `rememberInfiniteTransition`, `AnimatedVisibility`, `AnimatedContent`, `Crossfade`
- focus APIs: `FocusRequester`, `focusRequester`, `focusProperties`, `focusable`, `onFocusChanged`, `onPreviewKeyEvent`, `onKeyEvent`
- UI testing APIs: `createComposeRule`, `createAndroidComposeRule`, `onNodeWithText`, `assertIsDisplayed`, `assertIsFocused`, screenshot test rules
- KMP/CMP indicators: `commonMain`, `expect`, `actual`, `AndroidView`, `UIKitView`, platform services passed into common UI
- Android launch resources: `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon`, `android:windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon`, `drawable-v31`, `animated-vector`

If the repo is large, audit by category or by module. If subagents are available, parallelize category scans by spawning `Explore`-type subagents (no write tools) and merge the findings.

### 3a. Audit Android Launch UX Resources

This is non-scored adjacent coverage, but it should run on every normal audit because the failure is user-visible and cheap to miss in Kotlin-only scans.

Look for:

- `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon` and `android:windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon` in `res/values*/themes.xml` and `res/values*/styles.xml`
- referenced drawables such as `@drawable/ic_splash`
- API-qualified overrides in `res/drawable-v31/`
- drawable XML roots: `<animated-vector>`, `<vector>`, `<adaptive-icon>`, `<bitmap>`, `<layer-list>`

An `AnimatedVectorDrawable` is `Animatable`, so the platform draws it on a SurfaceView at full size; a static icon instead falls onto the internal `ImmobileIconDrawable` path (pre-rendered at 108 dp, upscaled into the 160/192 dp icon), which is what looks blurry on XHDPI+ devices. Flag a finding when all of these are true:

1. A theme sets `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon` for an Android app.
2. The API 31+ resource resolution points to a static icon (`<vector>`, `<adaptive-icon>`, bitmap, or a layer-list around those), or there is no `drawable-v31` override for the referenced splash icon.
3. The resource is not already an `<animated-vector>` on API 31+.

Report it as **Android Launch UX: Android 12+ static splash icon may render blurry**, not as a Compose score deduction. Evidence should include the theme item, the resolved drawable file, and whether the `res/drawable-v31` animated-vector override is missing. The fix direction is to keep the theme's `@drawable/<name>` stable and have it resolve to an `<animated-vector>` on API 31+ that wraps the real vector — **no animators are required; an empty `<animated-vector>` is enough**, because being an AVD is what changes the render path. One correctness caveat worth carrying into the report: the wrapper must reference a **separately-named** vector (a wrapper that references its own theme name re-resolves to itself on API 31+ and loops). Cite the Android splash-screen docs, the AndroidX `SplashScreen` reference, and the platform issue `https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/520672537` (which quotes the AOSP source). The bug dates to Android 12 (API 31) on XHDPI+ devices and was open when this skill shipped; confirm the live status against the issue rather than asserting it open-endedly.

### 4. Generate Compose Compiler Reports (Automatic)

Do **not** ask the user to edit `build.gradle` or run commands themselves. The skill runs the build with a bundled Gradle init script that injects `reportsDestination` / `metricsDestination` into every Compose module without modifying any file in the target repo. Before scoring, attempt this:

1. **Locate the init script** shipped with the skill: `scripts/compose-reports.init.gradle`. The absolute path is the skill's install location — in most installs that's `~/.claude/skills/jetpack-compose-audit/scripts/compose-reports.init.gradle`. If you cannot resolve the path, fall back to writing the script to `<target>/.compose-audit-reports.init.gradle` and delete it after the run.

2. **Check for a Gradle wrapper** in the target: `test -x <target>/gradlew`. If missing, skip to the fallback in step 6.

3. **Pick a compile target.** Prefer the cheapest task that still triggers Kotlin compilation for a Compose module:
   - find the first application module via `rg -l 'com\.android\.application' -g '*.gradle*'`
   - try in order: `:<app-module>:compileReleaseKotlinAndroid`, `:<app-module>:compileReleaseKotlin`, `assembleRelease`, `assembleDebug`
   - If the project is Compose-only on a library (`com.android.library`), use that module instead.

4. **Run the build.** Inform the user the build is starting (it may take several minutes).

   ```bash
   cd <target> && ./gradlew <task> \
       --init-script <path-to>/compose-reports.init.gradle \
       --no-daemon --quiet
   ```

   Use a 600-second timeout. If the task fails, try the next fallback task in step 3 once. Do **not** loop indefinitely.

5. **Collect the reports.**

   ```bash
   find <target> -path '*/build/compose_audit/*' \
       \( -name '*-classes.txt' -o -name '*-composables.txt' -o -name '*-composables.csv' -o -name '*-module.json' \)
   ```

   From these files, extract:
   - **unstable classes** (lines starting with `unstable class ` in `*-classes.txt`) used as composable parameters
   - **non-skippable but restartable named composables** (ignore zero-argument lambdas; focus on actual named functions in `*-composables.txt` or `*-composables.csv` where `isLambda == "0"`)
   - **module-wide skippability counts** from `*-module.json`, AND compute the **named-only skippability** from `*-composables.csv` (by filtering out rows where `isLambda == "1"` and calculating `sum(skippable) / sum(restartable)`). Cite both in the Performance section, noting that zero-argument lambdas can artificially anchor the module-wide metric.

6. **Fallback if the build fails or Gradle is unavailable.** Proceed with source-inferred stability findings, but:
   - set `Compiler diagnostics used: no` in the report's Notes And Limits and explain the failure reason briefly (wrapper missing, compile error, timeout)
   - reduce overall confidence by one level
   - state each stability-related deduction as "inferred from source — not verified against compiler reports"

Stability deductions from step 5 are measured evidence and should be weighted normally. Fallback deductions from step 6 are inferred and must be flagged as such in the report.

### 5. Audit The Four Categories

Use the scoring rubric in `references/scoring.md` and the heuristics in `references/search-playbook.md`.

> **Navigation 3:** if the repo uses `rememberNavBackStack`, `NavDisplay`, or `NavKey`, run **playbook section 2b** (Nav3 Detection & Audit) before scoring. Nav3 findings map to State Management and Side Effects — see the scoring note in section 2b.

#### Performance

Focus on:

- expensive work in composition
- avoidable recomposition
- lazy list keys
- paging list keys and `LazyPagingItems` misuse when `collectAsLazyPagingItems` is present
- bad state-read timing
- unstable or overly broad reads
- backwards writes
- animation phase correctness (per-frame values deferred to layout/draw via lambda modifiers, `Animatable` held in `remember`, `rememberInfiniteTransition` scoped so it stops offscreen)
- obvious release-performance hygiene where visible

#### State Management

Focus on:

- hoisting correctness
- single source of truth
- reusable stateless seams
- correct use of `remember` vs `rememberSaveable`
- lifecycle-aware observable collection
- paging `LoadState` handling (loading / empty / error / append) when `LazyPagingItems` is present
- observable vs non-observable mutable state

#### Side Effects

Focus on:

- side effects incorrectly done in composition
- correct effect API choice
- effect keys
- stale lambda capture
- cleanup correctness
- lifecycle-aware effect behavior
- animations driven from `LaunchedEffect(target)` for target-driven state changes (not from the composition body; `rememberCoroutineScope().launch { animateTo(...) }` is usually for event- or gesture-driven animation)
- paging `LazyPagingItems.refresh()` / `retry()` called from composition or `LaunchedEffect(Unit)` to "load on enter" — initial load is `PagingData`'s job; these are user-initiated only

#### Composable API Quality

Focus on reusable internal components, not every leaf screen.

Check:

- `modifier` presence and placement
- parameter order
- explicit over implicit configuration
- meaningful defaults
- avoiding `MutableState<T>` or `State<T>` parameters in reusable APIs where a better shape exists
- reusable animated components exposing `animationSpec: AnimationSpec<T>` where callers may reasonably need timing control, and using meaningful `label` values on shared/tooling-visible animations
- component purpose and layering

### 6. Verify Findings

Before deducting points:

- read the file where the smell appears
- make sure the pattern is real, not a false positive
- check whether the repo already has a compensating pattern elsewhere
- distinguish one-off mistakes from systemic patterns
- for stability findings (skippable / restartable / unstable params), use the compiler reports generated in Step 4. Cite the specific report line (e.g. `app/build/compose_audit/app_release-classes.txt:42`) as evidence. Only fall back to source-inferred stability claims if Step 4 failed, and label them as such.

### 7. Score

Assign each category a `0-10` score and a status:

- `0-3`: fail
- `4-6`: needs work
- `7-8`: solid
- `9-10`: excellent

Use the weights in `references/scoring.md` to compute the overall score.

**Measured ceilings are mandatory, not suggestive.** When Step 4 produced compiler reports, the Performance rubric in `references/scoring.md` defines a ceiling. First determine whether Strong Skipping is active (Kotlin 2.0.20+ / Compose Compiler 1.5.4+, or an explicit opt-in flag) and pick the matching table — the SSM-off table is driven by `skippable%` + unstable-class count, the SSM-on table by `skippable%` + instance-recreation churn + `equals()` quality on unstable params. After arriving at a qualitative Performance score, you MUST apply the ceiling and lower the score if it exceeds the cap. Show the math in the report, and name which table was applied:

```
Performance ceiling check:
  Strong Skipping: OFF (Kotlin 1.9.x, no opt-in) → applying SSM-off table
  skippable% = 186/273 = 68.1% → falls in 50-70% band → cap at 4
  qualitative score: 7
  applied score: 4 (ceiling lowered from 7)
```

Under Strong Skipping, `skippable%` will typically sit near 100% and stop being the binding constraint; the cap is usually driven by observed churn (`listOf(...)` / `mapOf(...)` / fresh literals passed into composables) or by expensive / broken `equals()` on unstable params. Name those findings explicitly in the ceiling-check block so the reader can audit the pick.

Do not round `skippable%` up into a higher band. `68.1%` is not `≥70%`. If a qualitative score lands at or below the ceiling, no adjustment is needed — but the check itself must appear in the report so the reader can audit it.

If a category genuinely has too little auditable surface area, mark it `N/A`, explain why, and renormalize the remaining weights.

### 8. Write The Report

Use `references/report-template.md`.

The report must include:

- overall score
- category score table
- top critical findings
- category-by-category reasoning
- evidence file paths
- prioritized remediation list
- optional follow-up note to run `material-3` if design issues are suspected
- optional coverage notes for testing, focus/keyboard, and KMP/CMP surfaces; these notes do not change the score unless they overlap with the scored categories

Write the report to:

- `COMPOSE-AUDIT-REPORT.md` inside the audited target (the path the user passed), not the current working directory.

If `COMPOSE-AUDIT-REPORT.md` already exists at that path, do not overwrite it silently. Either confirm overwrite with the user, or write to `COMPOSE-AUDIT-REPORT-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` alongside it.

### 9. Return A Short Summary

In chat, produce a summary that mirrors the report's `Prioritized Fixes` section — not a generic recap. The developer should be able to act on the summary alone without opening the report file.

Include:

- overall score (and the delta vs. any prior `COMPOSE-AUDIT-REPORT*.md` at the same path, if present)
- one-line judgment for each category, with the applied ceiling if any (e.g. "Performance 8/10 — capped by the SSM-on table: recreated `FeedItemUiModel` params")
- when animation defects affected Performance, name them explicitly in the Performance line (e.g. "Performance 6/10 — animated `offset` reads recompose `DrawerContent` every frame")
- when animation defects affected Side Effects, name them explicitly in the Side Effects line (e.g. "Side Effects 5/10 — `scope.launch { animateTo(...) }` in composition on `SettingsScreen`")
- when paging defects affected Side Effects, name them explicitly in the Side Effects line (e.g. "Side Effects 6/10 — `LaunchedEffect(Unit) { feed.refresh() }` on `FeedScreen` loads from composition")
- compiler-report highlights when Step 4 succeeded: Strong Skipping on/off (or mixed across modules), which ceiling table was applied, module-wide `skippable%`, named-only `skippable%`, which metric actually bound the cap, count of unstable shared types, and any module that failed to build
- **top three actionable fixes**, each with:
  - the concrete change ("add `key = { it.id }` to `items(...)` in `feed/FeedList.kt:42`")
  - file path(s) and line numbers — the same ones listed in the report's Prioritized Fixes
  - one official doc URL from `references/canonical-sources.md`
  - expected impact that matches the active ceiling table: on SSM-off, frame it in terms of named-only `skippable%` / unstable-param reductions; on SSM-on, frame it in terms of removing instance-recreation churn, fixing expensive / broken `equals()`, or clearing the binding cap
- whether a `material-3` audit is worth running next
- whether focused follow-up is worth running next: `compose-agent focus on testing`, `compose-agent focus on focus`, `compose-agent focus on kmp`, `compose-agent focus on animation`, or `compose-agent focus on paging`

The top-three fixes in the chat summary MUST be the same items as the report's `Prioritized Fixes` list (same file paths, same doc links). Do not add generic advice in chat that isn't in the written report.

## Evidence Rules

- Prefer multiple examples over one dramatic example.
- Use positive evidence too, not just failures.
- Do not infer runtime problems you cannot justify from the code.
- When a rule is based on official guidance but app-level tradeoffs may justify deviation, call it out as a tradeoff instead of pretending it is always wrong.

## Large Repo Strategy

For medium or large repositories:

1. Map modules first.
2. Pick representative files per module.
3. Parallelize category scans when possible.
4. Merge repeated findings into systemic issues instead of listing the same smell twenty times.

## What To Avoid

- Do not produce a generic checklist with no repository evidence.
- Do not turn the report into a public-library API lecture if the repo is an app.
- Do not inflate the performance score just because the app uses Compose.
- Do not over-penalize isolated experiments or sample files unless they are part of production paths.
- Do not score design in v1.
- Do not flag `LaunchedEffect(Unit)` or `LaunchedEffect(true)` on its own — the "run once" pattern is idiomatic. Only flag it when the body captures a value that may change without `rememberUpdatedState`. **Paging carve-out:** `LaunchedEffect(Unit) { lazyPagingItems.refresh() }` (or `retry()`) *is* a Side Effects defect — initial paged load is `PagingData`'s job, and `refresh()`/`retry()` are user-initiated. Flag it.
- Do not deduct on Compose Multiplatform code paths for Android-only APIs (`collectAsStateWithLifecycle`, `lifecycle-runtime-compose`). Note the platform constraint as a tradeoff instead.
- Do not double-count the same root cause across categories. A stability problem typically surfaces in both Performance and State — pick the dominant category and cross-reference.
