# Forge Models

## Overview
Define data models using `github.com/forgego/forge/schema`. This skill focuses on model structure that drives code generation: fields, relations, metadata, and hooks.

## When to Use
- The task mentions model structs, fields, relations, Meta options, or hooks.
- You need to change model schemas or codegen inputs.
- The user asks about renames, constraints, or lifecycle hooks.

## Quick Start
1. Create or edit a model struct embedding `schema.BaseSchema`.
2. Implement `Fields()`, `Meta()`, `Relations()`, and `Hooks()`.
3. Run `forge generate`, then `forge makemigrations` and `forge migrate`.

## Common Tasks
- Add or change fields and options (required, default, unique, max length).
- Add relations (ForeignKey, OneToOne, ManyToMany).
- Configure `Meta()` (table name, ordering, indexes, unique constraints).
- Add lifecycle hooks in `Hooks()`.

## Gotchas
- Renaming fields or relations requires migrations and can affect existing data.
- Always run `forge generate` after model changes.
- Model changes drive admin and API behavior, so keep naming consistent.
