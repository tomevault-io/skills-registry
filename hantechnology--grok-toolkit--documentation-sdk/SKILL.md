# Documentation SDK

This pack's native-safe metadata marks it as `surface: planned-adjacent`, `primary-route: false`, and `support-tier: planned`.

Use this pack as a bounded planned adjacent surface after `../../reference/routing-guidance.md` points here for API and SDK documentation work: source-of-truth contracts, reference docs, OpenAPI-driven content, examples and snippets, generated SDK surfaces, and release-adjacent documentation updates.

This pack keeps API and integration docs accurate, usable, and generation-friendly once the dominant route is already chosen. It is not the primary place to discover adjacent-pack routing, helper fit, or support posture, so send that first pass back to `../../reference/routing-guidance.md`. Use the overlays in `reference/api-docs-openapi-sdk.md` and `reference/technical-writing-release-notes.md` when contract structure, snippet quality, docs pipelines, or release-note-adjacent writing dominates the task, and keep generic product docs or architecture narratives outside this pack.

## Core focus

- Make API and source-of-truth docs authoritative for humans and tools.
- Keep SDK docs, examples, and generated references aligned with the actual contract surface.
- Prefer task-oriented explanations plus copy-paste-safe snippets for common integration paths.
- Update docs and release-adjacent notes as part of change delivery instead of after the release.
- Make compatibility windows, deprecations, and upgrade requirements explicit at the documentation boundary.

## Shared standards

- Treat the contract surface, such as OpenAPI or an equally explicit schema, as the canonical source for reference documentation and generated SDK output.
- Keep examples realistic and labeled with intent so readers can move from docs to working code without reverse-engineering missing context.
- Separate conceptual explanation from reference detail: guides should explain why and when, while API references and SDK docs should stay structured and precise.
- Make docs generation reproducible inside the release flow so published references and released SDK artifacts trace back to the same contract version.
- Update deprecations, upgrade guidance, and release-note-adjacent summaries in the same change path as the underlying API or SDK behavior.

## Default workflow

1. Read `../../reference/routing-guidance.md` first so planned-adjacent routing, helper discovery, and non-primary positioning come from the matrix instead of this pack.
2. Inspect the contract source of truth, current docs surface, SDK consumers, and any release-note or upgrade touchpoints.
3. Choose the relevant overlay: `reference/api-docs-openapi-sdk.md` for contract-driven references and SDK shape, or `reference/technical-writing-release-notes.md` for explanation quality and release-adjacent writing.
4. Refresh the canonical contract and reference outputs before polishing portal copy or examples.
5. Add realistic snippets, upgrade notes, and compatibility guidance where users are most likely to need them.
6. Run `review skill` after substantial documentation or SDK-surface changes.

## Collaboration in this repo

- Use research tools or the built-in Explore behavior before editing so new docs match local API naming, example style, and existing reference structure.
- Use research tools, Context7, or equivalent knowledge retrieval when OpenAPI, code generation, or documentation tooling details need a source-of-truth check.
- Treat this pack as planned and non-primary for routing discovery, and defer adjacent-pack choice or helper selection back to `../../reference/routing-guidance.md`.
- Pair with `architecture-integration` or the owning backend pack when contract ownership, schema evolution, or integration boundaries dominate the task.
- Pair with `release-engineering` when doc updates must align with version cuts, changelog flow, or publication timing.

## Overlays

- `reference/api-docs-openapi-sdk.md` for source-of-truth contracts, OpenAPI structure, SDK-safe naming, generated references, and example shape.
- `reference/technical-writing-release-notes.md` for task-oriented guides, upgrade and compatibility wording, release-note framing, and adjacent doc refreshes.

## Guardrails

- Do not let this pack expand into generic product docs, marketing copy, or broad architecture narratives.
- Do not let generated output drift away from the contract source of truth or let snippets drift away from shipped behavior.
- Do not let this planned adjacent pack read like a primary routing or support surface.
- Do not treat release notes as a substitute for durable API or SDK reference documentation.
