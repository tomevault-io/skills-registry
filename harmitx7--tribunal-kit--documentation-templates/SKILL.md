## Hallucination Traps (Read First)
- ❌ Writing documentation that only AI-generated code can understand -> ✅ Docs are for HUMANS; use clear language and real examples
- ❌ Documenting implementation details instead of behavior -> ✅ Document WHAT it does and WHY, not HOW (code shows how)
- ❌ Skipping the 'Quick Start' section -> ✅ The first 30 seconds of a README determine if someone uses your project

# Documentation Standards

## Documentation Types and Their Audiences

|Type|Audience|Goal|
|---|---|---|
|README|New developer joining the project|"Get me running in 10 minutes"|
|API docs|External integrator or frontend dev|"Tell me exactly what I can call and what I'll get back"|
|Architecture decision (ADR)|Future engineer inheriting the codebase|"Tell me why it works this way, not just how"|
|Code comment|Reviewer, maintainer|"Explain the non-obvious; skip the obvious"|
|Runbook|On-call engineer at 2am|"Tell me what to do, not what to think about"|

## Skill Pattern Inheritance

The Tribunal Agent Kit supports 5 standard Agent Design Kit (ADK) base patterns. 
To build a skill using a robust, tested agent behavior model, add `pattern: [pattern-name]` to the YAML frontmatter of your `SKILL.md`.

|Pattern|Value|When to use|
|---|---|---|
|**Inversion**|`pattern: inversion`|Forces the agent to interview the user (Socratic Gate) before acting.|
|**Reviewer**|`pattern: reviewer`|Evaluates artifacts against a checklist and severity levels.|
|**Tool Wrapper**|`pattern: tool-wrapper`|Strictly executes external CLI tools via provided documentation without guessing.|
|**Generator**|`pattern: generator`|Produces structured output (docs, boilerplate) by filling a rigid template.|
|**Pipeline**|`pattern: pipeline`|Executes sequential tasks with strict halting gates between steps.|

*Templates defining the specific rules for these patterns live in `.agent/patterns/`.*

## README Template

```markdown
# Project Name

One sentence: what this is and what problem it solves.

## Quick Start

\`\`\`bash
git clone ...
cd project
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Open http://localhost:3000

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- [Any other hard requirements]

## Project Structure

\`\`\`
src/
  api/        API routes
  lib/        Shared utilities
  services/   Business logic
\`\`\`

## Environment Variables

|Variable|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|
|DATABASE_URL|Yes|PostgreSQL connection string|
|JWT_SECRET|Yes|Secret for signing JWTs|

## Running Tests

\`\`\`bash
npm test              # unit tests
npm run test:e2e      # end-to-end tests
\`\`\`

## Contributing

[Brief contribution guide or link to CONTRIBUTING.md]
```

---

## API Documentation Standards

For each endpoint, document:

```markdown
### POST /api/users

Creates a new user account.

**Request Body**
\`\`\`json
{
  "email": "string (required, valid email)",
  "name": "string (required, 2–100 chars)",
  "role": "admin | user (optional, default: user)"
}
\`\`\`

**Responses**

|Status|Meaning|Body|
|---|---|---|
|201|User created|`{ data: User }`|
|400|Validation failed|`{ error: string, details: string[] }`|
|409|Email already exists|`{ error: string }`|

**Example**
\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST /api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "name": "Jane"}'
\`\`\`
```

---

## Code Comment Rules

**Comment the why, not the what:**

```ts
// ❌ States what the code does (obvious from reading it)
// Multiply price by tax rate
const total = price * taxRate;

// ✅ Explains why this specific value exists
// Vietnamese tax law requires 10% VAT on all digital goods (Circular 92/2015)
const VN_DIGITAL_TAX_RATE = 1.10;
const total = price * VN_DIGITAL_TAX_RATE;
```

**When to always comment:**
- Non-obvious business rules
- Workarounds for external library bugs (with issue link if possible)
- Performance decisions that look like premature optimization but aren't
- Magic numbers and why they have that value

---

## AI-Friendly Documentation

When a codebase will be worked on by AI assistants:

- Keep a `CODEBASE.md` at root with: tech stack, folder structure, key conventions
- Add a `ARCHITECTURE.md` with: system boundaries, data flow, key decisions
- Add `// @purpose:` comments on complex functions so AI can understand intent without reading the full implementation
- Document which files are auto-generated and should not be edited directly

---

## Runbook Template

```markdown
# Runbook: [Service or Incident Type]

## Symptoms
- [What the user or monitor reports]

## Likely Causes
1. [Most common cause]
2. [Second most common]

## Investigation Steps
\`\`\`bash
# Check service health
kubectl get pods -n production

# Check recent errors
kubectl logs deployment/api --since=15m | grep ERROR
\`\`\`

## Resolution Steps
### If Cause 1:
[Exact steps to resolve]

### If Cause 2:
[Exact steps to resolve]

## Escalation
If unresolved after 30 minutes → page @on-call-lead

## Post-Incident
[ ] Write incident report
[ ] Add monitoring for this failure mode
[ ] Update this runbook if steps changed
```

---

## Output Format

When this skill completes a task, structure your output as:

```
━━━ Documentation Templates Output ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Task:        [what was performed]
Result:      [outcome summary — one line]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Checks:      ✅ [N passed] · ⚠️  [N warnings] · ❌ [N blocked]
VBC status:  PENDING → VERIFIED
Evidence:    [link to terminal output, test result, or file diff]
```

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

---



**Slash command: `/review` or `/tribunal-full`**
**Active reviewers: `logic-reviewer` · `security-auditor`**

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.



Review these questions before confirming output:
```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.
- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.


## Pre-Flight Checklist
- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)
You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
