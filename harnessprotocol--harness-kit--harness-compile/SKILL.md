# Compile a Harness Configuration

You are compiling a `harness.yaml` file into native configuration files for one or more AI coding tools. Each target tool gets its own idiomatic output: instruction files, MCP server configs, skill files, and permission settings.

This skill implements the Harness Protocol compiler mapping defined at harnessprotocol.io. The output is deterministic — the same `harness.yaml` always produces the same files.

## Workflow Order (MANDATORY)

**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip any step.**

---

### Step 1: Find harness.yaml

Check for the harness file in this order:
1. A path provided by the user after `/harness-compile` (e.g., `/harness-compile ~/dotfiles/harness.yaml`)
2. `./harness.yaml` in the current directory

If no file is found at either location, tell the user:
> "No `harness.yaml` found. Specify a path: `/harness-compile path/to/harness.yaml`"

Read and parse the file. Extract `metadata.name` (use `default` if absent). Extract `version` to confirm v1 format. Note the `instructions.import-mode` value (default: `merge` if not specified).

If `version` is absent, is the integer `1` (legacy format), or is any value other than the string `"1"`, stop and tell the user: "This harness.yaml uses an unsupported format. Run `/harness-validate` to check the file and see upgrade instructions."

Also check for any flags the user passed:
- `--target <claude-code|cursor|copilot|all>` — restricts which targets are compiled
- `--dry-run` — preview output without writing any files
- `--clean` — remove orphaned marker blocks in addition to current update
- `--verbose` — show skipped slots and extra detail in the compilation report

---

### Step 2: Platform detection

If `--target` was provided, skip interactive detection and use those targets directly. `all` means compile for all three: `claude-code`, `cursor`, `copilot`.

Otherwise, scan the working directory for platform indicators:

**Claude Code** is present if any of these exist: `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`
**Cursor** is present if any of these exist: `.cursor/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.cursor/skills/`
**Copilot** is present if any of these exist: `.github/`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.github/skills/`

**Never assume a platform is present.** Detect each independently. If `.github/` is the only Copilot indicator, ask the user: "I found a `.github/` directory but no other Copilot indicators. Are you using GitHub Copilot in this project?"

Present the detected platforms as a multi-select and ask the user to confirm or adjust:

> "I detected these targets in your project:
>   [x] Claude Code (found: CLAUDE.md, .claude/)
>   [x] Cursor (found: .cursor/)
>   [ ] Copilot (not detected)
>
> Which targets should I compile for? (Confirm, add, or remove any.)"

Wait for confirmation before proceeding. If no platforms are detected, ask:
> "No AI tool config directories found. Which targets should I compile for? (claude-code, cursor, copilot)"

---

### Step 3: Compile instructions

For each confirmed target, write the instruction slots using this mapping:

| Harness slot | Claude Code | Copilot | Cursor |
|---|---|---|---|
| `instructions.operational` | `CLAUDE.md` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `.cursor/rules/harness.mdc` |
| `instructions.behavioral` | `AGENT.md` | `.github/instructions/behavioral.instructions.md` | `.cursor/rules/behavioral.mdc` |
| `instructions.identity` | `SOUL.md` | (omit — not supported) | (omit — not supported) |

**Section markers (exact format — do not deviate):**

Every generated block must be wrapped in markers. The `{name}` value is `metadata.name` from harness.yaml, or `default` if absent. The `{slot}` value is `operational`, `behavioral`, or `identity`.

```
<!-- BEGIN harness:{name}:{slot} -->
...generated content...
<!-- END harness:{name}:{slot} -->
```

Example with `metadata.name: data-engineer` and slot `operational`:
```
<!-- BEGIN harness:data-engineer:operational -->
## Commands
- Build: `dbt run`
<!-- END harness:data-engineer:operational -->
```

**Import-mode behavior:**

- **`merge`** (default): If the target file already exists and contains matching markers, update only the content between those markers. If no markers exist yet, append the marker block at the end of the file (creating the file if it does not exist).
- **`replace`**: Warn the user that existing content will be overwritten and require explicit confirmation before proceeding:
  > "Warning: import-mode 'replace' will overwrite `CLAUDE.md`.
  > Existing content (42 lines) will be replaced with generated content.
  > Your manual customizations outside the markers will be lost.
  >
  > Proceed? [y/N]"
  After confirmation, write the generated content wrapped in markers as the entire file. Skip the confirmation prompt on re-compilation if the file already contains only harness marker blocks.
- **`skip`**: Do not write or modify this slot's file at all. Leave it untouched.

**Cursor `.mdc` frontmatter (mandatory):**

Cursor rules files require YAML frontmatter. Always prepend this block before the instruction content for `.cursor/rules/harness.mdc` (operational slot):

```
---
description: Harness operational instructions
globs: **/*
alwaysApply: true
---
```

For `.cursor/rules/behavioral.mdc` (behavioral slot):

```
---
description: Harness behavioral preferences
globs: **/*
alwaysApply: true
---
```

The frontmatter goes before the `<!-- BEGIN ... -->` marker block.

**Copilot `.instructions.md` frontmatter:**

Copilot instructions files require YAML frontmatter. Always prepend this block:

```
---
applyTo: "**"
---
```

The frontmatter goes before the `<!-- BEGIN ... -->` marker block.

**Directory creation:** Create parent directories before writing if they don't exist (`.cursor/rules/`, `.github/instructions/`).

---

### Step 4: Compile MCP servers

If the harness has a `mcp-servers:` section, write MCP JSON config files for each confirmed target.

| Target | File path |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Copilot / VS Code | `.vscode/mcp.json` |

All three files use identical JSON structure. Translate from harness YAML:
- YAML key `transport` → JSON key `type`
- Omit any harness-specific YAML keys that have no MCP JSON equivalent

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-postgres", "--connection-string", "${DB_CONNECTION_STRING}"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note the casing:** `mcpServers` (camelCase) — not `mcp-servers`, not `mcp_servers`.

**Merging:** If the target MCP file already exists, merge: add new servers defined in the harness, but do not overwrite existing server configurations. Servers already present in the file take precedence.

If a server name in harness.yaml already exists in the target config file, **do not overwrite** but print a warning (substitute the actual target file path and server name):
```
Warning: <target-config-file> already defines server '<server-name>'. Existing config kept.
  To update it, edit <target-config-file> directly or remove the entry and re-run.
```
For example: `Warning: .cursor/mcp.json already defines server 'postgres'. Existing config kept.`

Create parent directories if they don't exist.

---

### Step 5: Compile skills

This step only runs if both conditions are true:
1. The harness has a `plugins:` section
2. At least one plugin has a SKILL.md discoverable via the source lookup below

For each plugin in `plugins:`, locate its SKILL.md by checking these locations in order:
1. `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — Claude Code global install
2. `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — project-local Cursor
3. `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — agentskills.io shared location

Use the first SKILL.md found. If no SKILL.md is found in any of these locations, skip that plugin and note it in the compilation report as: `<name>: skipped (no SKILL.md found in ~/.claude/skills/, .cursor/skills/, or .agents/skills/)`.

For each plugin that has a SKILL.md, copy it to each confirmed target's skill directory:

| Target | Skill directory |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | (skip — uses plugin install system, not file copy) |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Copilot | `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |

Ask the user which location to write to if multiple are applicable, or write to the platform-specific location by default (`.cursor/skills/<name>/` for Cursor, `.github/skills/<name>/` for Copilot).

**Frontmatter adaptation when copying to Cursor/Copilot:**
- If the source SKILL.md frontmatter has a `dependencies` field, rename it to `compatibility`
- Enforce that the `name` field matches the folder name: lowercase letters and hyphens only, max 64 characters. Truncate and slugify if needed.
- If `description` exceeds 1024 characters, truncate at the last word boundary before 1024 characters and append `…`.

Create parent directories before writing.

---

### Step 6: Compile permissions

**Claude Code:**

If the harness has a `permissions:` section, write or update `.claude/settings.json` with the permissions data:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Write", "Edit"],
    "deny": ["mcp__postgres__drop_*"],
    "additionalDirectories": ["sql/", "migrations/"]
  }
}
```

The keys map as follows:
- `permissions.tools.allow` → `permissions.allow`
- `permissions.tools.deny` → `permissions.deny`
- `permissions.paths` → `permissions.additionalDirectories`

If `.claude/settings.json` already exists, merge: update or add the `permissions` key without touching other keys in the file.

**Cursor and Copilot:**

These tools do not support machine-enforceable permissions via a JSON config. Instead, append a human-readable permission description inside markers to the operational instructions file for that target (e.g., appended to the marker block in `.cursor/rules/harness.mdc` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`):

```markdown
## Tool Permissions

This harness specifies the following tool permissions:
- **Allowed**: Read, Glob, Grep, Write, Edit, Bash
- **Denied**: Any tool matching `mcp__*__drop_*` or `mcp__*__delete_*`

Please configure your tool's permission settings to match these constraints.
```

Print a warning for each non-Claude-Code target that has a `deny` list:
```
Warning: permissions.tools.deny is not machine-enforceable for target 'cursor'.
  Denied tools: mcp__*__drop_*
  Instructions have been updated to describe the intended permissions,
  but manual tool configuration is required.
```

---

### Step 7: Handle flags

**`--dry-run`:**

Do not write any files. Instead, for each file that would be written, print its path and full content:

```
[DRY RUN] Would write: CLAUDE.md
----------------------------------------
<!-- BEGIN harness:data-engineer:operational -->
## Commands
- Build: `dbt run`
<!-- END harness:data-engineer:operational -->
----------------------------------------

[DRY RUN] Would write: .mcp.json
----------------------------------------
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": { ... }
  }
}
----------------------------------------
```

End with:
> "Dry run complete. No files were written. Remove --dry-run to apply."

**`--clean`:**

In addition to normal compilation, scan all target files for orphaned marker blocks — markers whose `{name}` no longer matches `metadata.name` in the current harness.yaml.

Example: if a file contains `<!-- BEGIN harness:old-harness:operational -->` but the current harness name is `data-engineer`, that block is orphaned.

Before deleting any orphaned blocks, the agent **must**:
1. List every orphaned block found: profile name, slot, file, and line numbers
2. Show the user exactly what will be deleted
3. Ask for confirmation: "Remove these N orphaned blocks? [y/N]"
4. Only proceed with deletion if the user confirms

This confirmation is required every time. `--clean` is a destructive operation with no recovery path — never skip this step.

---

### Step 8: Print compilation report

After all files are written (or previewed in dry-run mode), print a compilation report:

```
Compiled harness: data-engineer (v1.2.0)
Targets: claude-code, cursor

  CLAUDE.md                        operational   merge    48 lines added
  AGENT.md                         behavioral    merge    12 lines added
  .mcp.json                        mcp-servers   ——       2 servers
  .claude/settings.json            permissions   ——       4 allowed, 1 denied
  .cursor/rules/harness.mdc        operational   merge    48 lines added
  .cursor/rules/behavioral.mdc     behavioral    merge    12 lines added
  .cursor/mcp.json                 mcp-servers   ——       2 servers

  Warnings:
    permissions.tools.deny is not machine-enforceable for target 'cursor'.
```

Format rules:
- Group by target: claude-code entries first, then cursor, then copilot
- Within each target group, list files in slot order: operational, behavioral, identity, mcp-servers, permissions, skills
- Skipped slots are omitted unless `--verbose` is passed
- Show line counts for instruction files where calculable
- Show server counts for MCP files
- Show allowed/denied counts for permissions

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using wrong marker format | Markers must be exact: `<!-- BEGIN harness:{name}:{slot} -->` — any deviation breaks re-compilation merge logic |
| Using `mcp_servers` or `mcp-servers` in JSON | JSON key must be `mcpServers` (camelCase) |
| Omitting Cursor `.mdc` frontmatter | Always add frontmatter to `.mdc` files — it is mandatory for Cursor to recognize the file |
| Omitting Copilot `.instructions.md` frontmatter | Always add `applyTo: "**"` frontmatter to Copilot instructions files |
| Overwriting existing MCP server configs on merge | Merge means add new servers only; existing server definitions win |
| Silently skipping MCP server key collisions | Always warn when a server name already exists in the target file — never skip silently |
| Expecting `import-mode` to be per-slot | `import-mode` is a single scalar under `instructions:` that applies to all slots. Per-slot override is not supported in v1 |
| Writing SOUL.md for non-Claude-Code targets | `identity` slot is Claude Code-only — omit it for cursor and copilot |
| Assuming platforms are present | Always detect independently; never assume a platform exists |
| Applying `--clean` without the flag | Only remove orphaned markers when `--clean` is explicitly passed |
| Skipping `replace` confirmation | Always confirm with the user before overwriting existing file content |
| Skipping parent directory creation | Always create parent dirs (`.cursor/rules/`, `.github/instructions/`, `.vscode/`) before writing |
| Using `{name}` as literal string in markers | `{name}` must be replaced with the actual `metadata.name` value, or `default` if absent |
