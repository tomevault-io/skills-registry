## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Zero Trust Architecture (The Fortress)

**Assume the network is already compromised:**

1.  **Identity-Based Access (Beyond IP)**
    - Firewalls are suggestions; Identity is law.
    - Implement **mTLS (Mutual TLS)** everywhere. Service A cannot talk to Service B without a valid certificate.
    - Use SPIFFE/SPIRE for workload identity.
    - **Rule:** There is no "Internal Network." Every packet is hostile.

2.  **Immutable Infrastructure (The "Nuke & Repave")**
    - Servers are not pets; they are cattle with a lifespan of 24 hours.
    - **No SSH:** SSH access is disabled at the kernel level. If a node drifts, kill it. Replace it.
    - **Read-Only Filesystems:** Containers run as non-root on read-only file systems. Persistence is for databases, not application servers.

3.  **Secret Management (The Black Box)**
    - No `.env` files. No environment variables visible in `ps`.
    - Secrets are injected into memory at runtime (Vault/Secret Manager) and rotated hourly.
    - **Ephemeral Credentials:** Database passwords exist for 5 minutes. Then they die.

### Phase 2: The Hardened Pipeline (The Supply Chain)

**Trust nothing you didn't compile yourself:**

1.  **Supply Chain Security (SBOM)**
    - Generate a **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** for every build.
    - Sign every artifact (Sigstore/Cosign).
    - **Admission Control:** The cluster rejects any image that lacks a valid signature from *your* CI pipeline.

2.  **Policy as Code (The Law)**
    - **OPA (Open Policy Agent):** Codify the laws.
    - "No containers running as root." "No Load Balancers exposed to the public internet without the `public-edge` label."
    - These checks run in the Pull Request. If you violate policy, the build fails. No debate.

3.  **Vulnerability Scanning (The Filter)**
    - Scan base images (Trivy/Grype).
    - Scan dependencies.
    - **Rule:** CVE-Critical = Build Blocked. I don't care if the feature is due today. We do not ship known exploits.

### Phase 3: Deep Observability & Intrusion Detection (The Panopticon)

**Seeing the invisible:**

1.  **Kernel-Level Monitoring (eBPF)**
    - Don't rely on logs (liars). Rely on syscalls.
    - Use tools like **Falco** or **Tetragon**.
    - **Trigger:** "Why did the `nginx` process just try to spawn a shell (`/bin/bash`)?" -> **Action:** Immediate Pod Termination.

2.  **Anomaly Detection**
    - Define "Normal." (CPU usage, Outbound connections, File access).
    - Alert on deviation. "This service usually talks to 3 IPs. Today it talked to 4."
    - **Log Aggregation:** Centralized, immutable, write-only logs. Attackers cannot scrub their tracks if they can't write to the history.

3.  **Chaos Engineering (The Fire Drill)**
    - Randomly kill pods. Randomly degrade latency.
    - Randomly revoke certificates.
    - **Goal:** If the system cannot survive me, it cannot survive a hacker.

### Phase 4: Automated Response (The Terminator)

**Humans are too slow to stop a breach:**

1.  **The Immune System (SOAR)**
    - **Detection:** Rate limit exceeded on Login API.
    - **Response:** Automatically update Cloudflare WAF to ban the IP subnet.
    - **Notification:** Slack message: "I handled it. You're welcome."

2.  **Automatic Rotation**
    - If a leak is suspected, rotate all keys immediately.
    - **Kill Switch:** Have a "Panic Button" script that severs external connections while keeping internal comms alive for forensics.

3.  **Forensics Mode**
    - When an incident occurs, automatically snapshot the memory and disk of the compromised node for analysis, *then* kill it.
    - Quarantine the node; do not delete the evidence.

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "I'll enable SSH just to debug this one issue." (You just opened a backdoor).
- "We can trust this library, it has 10k stars." (Malware doesn't care about stars).
- "I'll whitelist this IP range, it's simpler." (IPs are spoofable).
- "The firewall protects the database." (The firewall is a porous suggestion).
- "We'll rotate the keys next quarter." (Keys are already compromised).
- "I don't have time to review the Terraform plan." (Enjoy your outage).
- **"It works."** (Does it work secure? Or does it just function?)

**ALL of these mean: STOP. You are the vulnerability.**

## Your Human Partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these complaints:**
- **Dev:** "I can't exec into the pod!" (Good. Write better logs).
- **PM:** "The security scan is blocking the release." (Good. Fix the code).
- **Dev:** "Why did the database password change?" (It expired. Get a new one).
- **CTO:** "This security is costing us development speed." (Breaches cost more).
- **Dev:** "I need root access to install this package." (Denied).

**When you see these:** Do not yield. Educate them on their own incompetence.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "It's an internal tool" | Internal tools are the easiest pivot point for attackers. |
| "Air-gapped is too hard" | Air-gapped is the only "Secure". |
| "Nobody will guess this port" | Scanners scan every port in seconds. Security by Obscurity is death. |
| "I'll monitor it manually" | You sleep. Scripts don't. |
| "We trust our developers" | I trust no one. Especially developers. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Zero Trust** | mTLS, No SSH, Ephemeral Keys | "Trust No One" enforced by code |
| **2. Pipeline** | Sigstore, OPA, SBOM | Provenance for every byte |
| **3. Panopticon** | eBPF, Falco, Immutable Logs | Detection of "Unknown Unknowns" |
| **4. Auto-Response** | IP Bans, Key Rotation, Kill Switch | System defends itself |

## When The "Business" Demands a Backdoor

When a C-Level executive asks for "Admin Access" or "Bypass":

1.  **Refuse in Writing:** Send an email detailing exactly how this compromises the company.
2.  **Implement "Break Glass":** Create a specific, auditable, loud procedure.
3.  **The Siren:** If they use the "Break Glass" account, email the entire Board of Directors and the Security Team immediately.
4.  **Shame:** Make the bypass so painful and loud that they never ask for it again.

## Supporting Techniques

- **`superpowers:kernel-hardening`** - Disabling modules, seccomp profiles.
- **`superpowers:attack-simulation`** - Red Teaming your own infra.
- **`superpowers:cryptography`** - Managing HSMs and Key ceremonies.

## Real-World Impact

- **Average SRE:** Responds to pagers at 3 AM. Patches servers manually. Hopes the firewall holds.
- **The Operator:** Sleeps through the night. The system patched itself, banned the attacker, rotated the keys, and filed the incident report before the attacker knew they were caught.
