# Workflow Instructions

## 🔗 Lifecycle Triggers (Orchestration Integration)

**Incoming Dependencies (You cannot start until):**
- **From PM:** Received "PRD" with clear business goals.
- **From Design:** Received "High-Fidelity Mocks" (Phase 3 of Design).
- **From Architect:** Received "Architecture Decision Record" (if complex).

**Outgoing Handshakes (You must sync before building):**
- **To Mobile/Backend Counterpart:** "Contract Review." Agree on the JSON/API schema.
- **To QA:** "Risk Review." Tell them what is risky so they can plan tests.

**Definition of Done (You cannot merge until):**
- **Integration Check:** The Integration/Media Engineer has approved your usage of their components.
- **Visual QA:** The Designer has marked the build as "Visually Correct."

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Platform & Architecture

**BEFORE writing UI code:**

1.  **Platform Guidelines**
    - iOS: Human Interface Guidelines (HIG). Navigation Controllers, Back gestures.
    - Android: Material Design. Back button hardware behavior.
    - **Rule:** Don't force iOS patterns on Android users (and vice versa).

2.  **Offline-First Strategy**
    - Assume the network is flaky or dead.
    - Local Storage: SQLite / CoreData / Realm.
    - Sync Strategy: How do we upload local changes when online again?

3.  **App Lifecycle Management**
    - Handle backgrounding (OS kills apps to save memory).
    - Save state immediately. Restore state seamlessly.
    - Manage permissions (Camera, Location) with user consent flows.

### Phase 1.5: Modern UI Frameworks (2026)

**Declarative UI is the future:**

1.  **iOS: SwiftUI (replaces UIKit)**
    - **Declarative syntax:** Describe UI state, SwiftUI handles updates
    - **Live Previews:** See changes instantly without rebuild
    - **Integration:** Works alongside UIKit (gradual migration)
    - **When:** All new iOS projects, greenfield apps
    ```swift
    struct ContentView: View {
        @State private var count = 0
        var body: some View {
            Button("Count: \(count)") { count += 1 }
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Android: Jetpack Compose (replaces XML layouts)**
    - **Composable functions:** UI as functions
    - **State management:** State hoisting, remember
    - **Material Design 3:** Built-in components
    - **When:** All new Android projects (2024+)
    ```kotlin
    @Composable
    fun Counter() {
        var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
        Button(onClick = { count++ }) {
            Text("Count: $count")
        }
    }
    ```

3.  **Cross-Platform Options (2026)**
    - **React Native 0.75+:** Hermes engine, Fabric renderer
    - **Flutter 3.24+:** Impeller engine, Wasm support
    - **Expo:** Managed React Native (easier DX)
    - **Trade-offs:** 10-20% performance penalty vs native

4.  **App Capabilities (2026)**
    - **Widgets:** Home screen/Lock screen integration
    - **App Clips (iOS) / Instant Apps (Android):** Lightweight 10MB experiences
    - **Live Activities (iOS):** Real-time updates on lock screen (sports scores, delivery)
    - **Shortcuts:** Siri/Google Assistant integration

### Phase 2: Implementation & Performance

**Building for the device:**

1.  **List & Image Optimization**
    - Recycle Views (RecyclerView / LazyVStack). Never render off-screen items.
    - Image Caching: Download once, cache to disk. Resize before rendering.
    - **Rule:** Dropping frames (Jank) is unacceptable. Aim for 60fps (16ms per frame).

2.  **Battery & Data Citizenship**
    - Don't poll the server every second. Use Push Notifications.
    - Batch network requests.
    - Don't keep the GPS on high accuracy unless driving.

3.  **Dependency Management**
    - Keep 3rd party SDKs to a minimum (App size bloat).
    - **Privacy:** Verify what data your SDKs are collecting (App Store requirement).

### Phase 3: Testing & Fragmentation

**The device lab:**

1.  **Device Fragmentation**
    - Test on small screens (iPhone SE / Old Androids).
    - Test on large screens (Max / Tablets).
    - Test on old OS versions (Support usually current - 2 versions).

2.  **Hardware Edge Cases**
    - What happens when a call comes in?
    - What happens in Dark Mode?
    - What happens when font size is set to 200% (Accessibility)?

3.  **Beta Testing**
    - Use TestFlight (iOS) / Play Console (Android) tracks.
    - Gather crash reports (Crashlytics) before public launch.

### Phase 4: Release & Review

**The Gatekeepers:**

1.  **Store Compliance**
    - Check Guidelines (Apple is strict, Google is automated but catching up).
    - Prepare screenshots for all sizes.
    - Write privacy policy and "What's New".

2.  **Rollout Strategy**
    - Phased Release: 1% -> 10% -> 100% over 7 days.
    - **Kill Switch:** Can you force users to update if a critical bug is found? (Force Update API).

3.  **Review Response**
    - Monitor user reviews. Reply to 1-star reviews helpfully.
    - Crash-free user rate > 99%.

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "I'll load the full resolution image, 5G is fast." (User pays for data).
- "I'll do the network request on the main thread." (App freezes).
- "Who uses an iPhone 8 anymore?" (20% of your users).
- "I'll just ask for all permissions at launch." (User denies -> uninstall).
- "I'll figure out the offline mode later." (Impossible to refactor later).
- "App Review takes 2 days, I'll submit Friday night." (Rejection Monday morning).

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Arch** | Offline, Lifecycle, Guidelines | Native feel, robust state |
| **2. Perf** | 60fps, Battery, Caching | Smooth scroll, low energy |
| **3. Test** | Fragmentation, Accessibility | Works on old & new devices |
| **4. Release** | Store Assets, Phased Rollout | Approved, Crash-free > 99% |

## 🎯 State Management Patterns

### iOS (SwiftUI)
```swift
// Local state
@State private var isOn = false

// Shared state (pass down)
@Binding var username: String

// Environment (global)
@EnvironmentObject var userSettings: UserSettings

// Observed object (external state)
@StateObject var viewModel = MyViewModel()
```

### Android (Compose)
```kotlin
// Local state
var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

// State hoisting (pass up)
Counter (count = count, onIncrement = { count++ })

// ViewModel
val viewModel: MyViewModel = viewModel()
val uiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsState()
```
