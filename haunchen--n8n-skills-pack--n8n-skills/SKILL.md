# n8n Workflow Automation Skill Pack

## Overview

This skill helps with:
- Understanding n8n node functionality and usage
- Finding nodes suitable for specific tasks
- Learning common workflow patterns
- Getting node configuration examples
- Solving workflow design problems

This skill includes:
- Detailed information on the 10 most commonly used built-in n8n nodes
- 30+ popular community packages for extended functionality
- Node configuration examples and best practices
- Common workflow patterns
- Node categorization and indexing for both built-in and community nodes

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Building or designing n8n workflows
- Searching for nodes that match specific functionality
- Troubleshooting node configurations or connections
- Understanding node input/output compatibility
- Exploring community packages for extended functionality

Do NOT use when:
- Learning general automation concepts (use n8n official docs)
- Deploying or hosting n8n (infrastructure questions)
- Pricing or licensing questions (contact n8n directly)

## Quick Navigation

Use this flowchart to find the right resource:

```dot
digraph navigation {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=diamond];

    start [label="What do you need?" shape=ellipse];
    q1 [label="Know the\nnode name?"];
    q2 [label="Know the\nfunctionality?"];
    q3 [label="Need\nexamples?"];

    node [shape=box];
    a1 [label="Glob: resources/**/*{name}*.md"];
    a2 [label="Grep: search keywords\nin resources/"];
    a3 [label="Read: resources/templates/"];
    a4 [label="Read: INDEX.md\nby category"];

    start -> q1;
    q1 -> a1 [label="yes"];
    q1 -> q2 [label="no"];
    q2 -> a2 [label="yes"];
    q2 -> q3 [label="no"];
    q3 -> a3 [label="yes"];
    q3 -> a4 [label="no"];
}
```

- [Workflow Patterns](resources/guides/workflow-patterns.md) - Common patterns

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Reading entire merged files (thousands of lines) | Use INDEX.md to find line numbers, then use offset/limit for precise reading |
| Confusing Trigger and Action nodes | Triggers can only be placed at workflow start, Actions can be anywhere |
| Ignoring node compatibility | Check compatibility-matrix.md to verify node connections |
| Using wrong node naming format | File format is `nodes-base.{nodeType}.md`, nodeType is usually camelCase |

See [Usage Guide](resources/guides/usage-guide.md#common-pitfalls) for more details.

## Resources

- [Workflow Patterns](resources/guides/workflow-patterns.md) - 6 common workflow patterns
- [Template Library](resources/templates/README.md) - 20 popular templates
