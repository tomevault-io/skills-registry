name: temporal-boundary-enforcer
description: Enforces and validates temporal and phase boundaries while coding by inspecting real event/state artifacts via terminal access. Automatically used whenever code affects time, ticks, phases, windows, or lifecycle boundaries to prevent delayed corruption and illegal cross-phase behavior. Use when this capability is needed.

# Temporal Boundary Enforcer

This skill enforces **time and phase boundaries as hard laws**, not conventions.

It is designed for an agent that is **actively writing or modifying code** in a
tick-based, phase-driven, event-sourced simulation. Many of the most dangerous
bugs do not crash the system — they **violate boundaries silently** and corrupt
future state.

The Temporal Boundary Enforcer:
- discovers execution artifacts via terminal commands,
- validates that actions occur only in allowed temporal windows,
- detects illegal “after the fact” or “too early” effects,
- identifies the earliest boundary breach,
- produces evidence-backed violations with precise remediation steps,
- writes helper scripts when boundary checks are repeated.

This skill does **not** reason abstractly about time.  
It verifies **what actually happened** against **what is allowed to happen**.

---

## When to use this skill (Agent-centric, mandatory triggers)

The agent MUST invoke this skill automatically in the following situations:

### 1. After modifying phase or lifecycle logic
Use after changes to:
- TripPhase transitions
- boarding open/close logic
- dispatch readiness windows
- arrival, completion, or cleanup logic

Purpose: ensure **no logic crosses forbidden phase boundaries**.

---

### 2. After modifying tick or scheduling logic
Use after changes to:
- per-tick update ordering
- pre-tick vs post-tick execution
- scheduled or delayed actions
- “next tick” or “after N ticks” mechanics

Purpose: ensure **time-relative actions fire only when valid**.

---

### 3. After modifying market or window-based logic
Use after changes to:
- market window open/close rules
- demand allocation timing
- backlog carryover semantics
- pricing window enforcement

Purpose: ensure **windowed logic does not leak across windows**.

---

### 4. After refactors affecting control flow
Use after:
- moving logic between modules
- extracting helpers from tick handlers
- consolidating lifecycle logic

Purpose: detect **boundary checks that were lost or reordered**.

---

### 5. Before finalizing fixes involving delayed effects
Use before concluding work on bugs involving:
- late passenger release
- actions firing after trip completion
- resources consumed after arrival
- UI state changing after backend window closed

Purpose: **prove boundary safety**, not assume it.

---

## Operating principles (Non-negotiable)

1. **Boundaries are absolute**
   - If an action occurs outside its allowed window, it is an error — even if “nothing broke yet”.

2. **Earliest breach wins**
   - The first boundary violation is the root cause, not downstream symptoms.

3. **Evidence-driven**
   - Every violation must reference concrete artifacts (event ids, log lines, snapshot fields).

4. **Deterministic reasoning only**
   - No wall-clock time, no heuristics, no guesses.

5. **Read-only discipline**
   - Diagnose and recommend. Do not modify product code unless explicitly instructed.

6. **Scripts are encouraged**
   - Write scripts when boundary checks are repeated or complex.

---

## Artifact discovery (Terminal usage is mandatory)

If artifact paths are not explicitly provided, the agent MUST locate them.

### Required discovery steps

```bash
ls
find . -maxdepth 4 -type d -name "logs" -o -name "wal" -o -name "events" -o -name "snapshots" 2>/dev/null
rg -n "TripPhase|Boarding|Closed|Opened|tick|window|phase" . 2>/dev/null || true
find . -type f \( -name "*.wal" -o -name "*.ndjson" -o -name "*.log" -o -name "*.snap" \) | head -n 50

If tests are involved:

cargo test -q <suspect_test> -- --nocapture

Record all artifact paths for evidence references.
Temporal boundary model (must be explicit)

The enforcer assumes that the simulation defines explicit boundaries, such as:

    Tick boundaries

        pre-tick

        tick

        post-tick

    Phase boundaries (example: trips)

        Scheduled

        BoardingOpen

        BoardingClosed

        EnRoute

        Arrived

        Completed

    Window boundaries (example: markets)

        MarketWindowOpen

        MarketWindowClosed

If the code does not define these explicitly, the enforcer must:

    infer them from events and state,

    and emit a warning recommending explicit boundary modeling.

Core boundary rules (enforced)
A. Phase boundaries (Trips)

    TB-TRIP-001: No passenger release outside BoardingOpen

    TB-TRIP-002: No boarding changes after BoardingClosed

    TB-TRIP-003: No phase transitions skipping required intermediates

    TB-TRIP-004: No actions on trips after Completed

B. Tick boundaries

    TB-TICK-001: State mutations must occur in allowed tick stage

    TB-TICK-002: Scheduled actions must not fire earlier than scheduled tick

    TB-TICK-003: Delayed actions must not fire after expiry window

C. Market windows

    TB-MKT-001: Demand allocation only while window open

    TB-MKT-002: Window-closed logic must not emit allocation events

    TB-MKT-003: Backlog carryover must occur exactly once per window close

D. UI / Readiness windows

    TB-UI-001: UI-visible actions must not be enabled after backend window closes

    TB-UI-002: Backend must reject commands outside allowed windows

Script authoring policy (empowered)

The agent is explicitly empowered to write scripts to accelerate boundary analysis.
Allowed scripts

    per-entity phase timelines

    per-tick action summaries

    window open/close interval extraction

    late/early action detection

    boundary violation scanners

Where scripts live

.agent/skills/temporal-boundary-enforcer/scripts/

Script requirements

    deterministic

    read-only by default

    supports --help

    idempotent

    outputs human-readable text or structured JSON

Write a script when:

    boundary checks are repeated

    multiple entities/windows must be scanned

    timing relationships are non-trivial

    results need to be compared across runs

Recommended default scripts

Create as needed:

    scripts/extract_phase_timeline.py

    scripts/extract_window_intervals.py

    scripts/scan_boundary_violations.py

    scripts/summarize_tick_actions.py

Enforcement procedure (Step-by-step)
Step 1 — Define allowed boundaries

From code intent, explicitly list:

    allowed phases/windows

    allowed actions per phase/window

    allowed tick stages for mutations

If boundaries are implicit, infer and note assumptions.
Step 2 — Extract actual timelines

Using events/snapshots:

    build phase timelines per entity

    build window open/close intervals

    map actions to ticks and phases

Use scripts if repeated.
Step 3 — Validate actions against boundaries

For each action:

    identify its phase/window/tick

    check if action is allowed there

    flag earliest illegal occurrence

Step 4 — Identify first breach

Determine:

    the earliest boundary violation

    the boundary that was crossed

    the downstream effects caused by the breach

This is the primary finding.
Step 5 — Emit the Temporal Boundary Report

Required output shape:

{
  "summary": {
    "status": "violated",
    "first_violation_tick": 18240,
    "boundary_type": "TripPhase",
    "entity_refs": ["trip:1234"]
  },
  "violations": [
    {
      "id": "TB-TRIP-001",
      "severity": "error",
      "message": "Passenger release occurred after BoardingClosed",
      "tick": 18240,
      "phase": "BoardingClosed",
      "evidence_refs": ["events.wal#89321", "logs/sim.log:4421-4430"],
      "remediation_hint": "Move passenger release logic to BoardingOpen phase or guard by TripPhase"
    }
  ]
}

Remediation hint rules

Every violation must include:

    the specific boundary crossed

    the illegal action

    the most likely missing or misplaced guard

    the concrete location to inspect next

No generic advice.

Final doctrine

Temporal boundaries are where simulations rot silently.

This skill exists to ensure:

    actions happen only when allowed,

    windows and phases remain authoritative,

    delayed corruption is prevented at the source,

    and time remains a reliable axis of truth.

Use it while coding, not after damage accumulates.
