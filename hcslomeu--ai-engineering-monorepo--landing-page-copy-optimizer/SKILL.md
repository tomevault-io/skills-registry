# Landing Page Copy Optimizer

Analyze and optimize SaaS landing page copy using April Dunford's positioning methodology, then generate implementation-ready prompts for vibe coding tools.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Fetch & Analyze** - Read current copy from user's URL
2. **Positioning Analysis** - Apply April Dunford methodology
3. **Validation** - Confirm features/alternatives with user
4. **Positioning Draft** - Present for approval
5. **New Copy** - Generate optimized copy for all sections → approval
6. **Asset Collection** - Request screenshots + visual reference
7. **Final Prompt** - Generate detailed vibe coding prompt with design.json

## Step 1: Fetch & Analyze

Use `web_fetch` on the user's URL. Extract:
- Current copy (headlines, descriptions, CTAs)
- Product/service being sold
- Apparent target audience
- Existing social proof
- Current page structure
- **Language and tone** (match these in output)

## Step 2: Positioning Analysis

Apply April Dunford's methodology **in this exact order**:

### 2.1 Competitive Alternatives
Infer what customers would use if this product didn't exist:
- **Direct competitors**: Similar SaaS products
- **Indirect alternatives**: Spreadsheets, manual processes, hiring someone, doing nothing

### 2.2 Unique Features/Capabilities
Identify features ONLY this product has. Look for:
- Explicit features mentioned on the page
- Implicit differentiators in the copy
- **Always ask user to confirm/add features**

### 2.3 Value Themes
For each unique feature, define the customer benefit. Then group into **maximum 3 value themes** to avoid diluted messaging.

### 2.4 Target Customer Characteristics
Define who cares most about these value themes:
- Behaviors that make them value the differentiators
- Common characteristics/pain points
- Why alternatives don't work for them

### 2.5 Market Category
Suggest a category that:
- Already exists in customer's mind (CRM, Meeting Assistant, etc.)
- Add a differentiating modifier (e.g., "AI-native CRM", "Undetectable Meeting Assistant")
- **Avoid category creation** - use existing categories with a twist

## Step 3: Validation Questions

**Always ask these questions**, even when answers seem clear:

```
Based on my analysis, here's what I found:

**Competitive Alternatives:**
[list inferred alternatives]
→ Is this correct? Any alternatives I missed?

**Unique Features:**
[list features found]
→ Are these accurate? What features do YOU have that competitors don't?

**Target Customer:**
[describe inferred target]
→ Does this match your ideal customer?
```

## Step 4: Positioning Draft

Present positioning summary for approval:

```
## Positioning Summary

**Market Category:** [category + modifier]
**Competitive Alternatives:** [list]
**Unique Features:** [list with brief descriptions]
**Value Themes:** [max 3 themes, each with supporting features]
**Target Customer:** [characteristics and behaviors]

---
Does this positioning feel right? Any adjustments before I create the copy?
```

**Wait for explicit approval before proceeding.**

## Step 5: New Copy Generation

Generate copy for all sections. See [references/copy-structure.md](references/copy-structure.md) for detailed requirements.

### Section Structure (SaaS Landing Page)

1. **Hero** - Title (≤70 chars), Subtitle (≤150 chars), CTA (≤20 chars), Image spec
2. **Social Proof** - User count or company logos
3. **Product vs. Alternatives** - Comparison highlighting differentiators
4. **Features & Value** - Unique features with screenshots, titles, descriptions
5. **How It Works** - Step-by-step process
6. **Testimonials** - Quotes reinforcing competitive claims (can be invented)
7. **Target Customers** - Cards showing ideal user profiles
8. **CTA** - Final call to action
9. **FAQ** - Address common objections
10. **Footer** - Standard links

### Copy Guidelines

- Match original site's **language** (PT-BR, EN, etc.)
- Match original site's **tone** (formal, casual, technical, etc.)
- Hero must answer: "What is this?" and "Why is it different?"
- Features section: ONLY unique features (table stakes are implied by category)
- Testimonials format: Name + Inferred Role (based on ICP) + Quote reinforcing differentiators
- FAQ: Address objections that prevent conversion

**Present copy for approval before proceeding.**

## Step 6: Asset Collection

### Product Screenshots
Ask user for screenshots of key product screens:
```
To create the final prompt, I need some product visuals:

1. Do you have screenshots of these key screens?
   - Main dashboard/interface
   - Key unique features in action
   - Any screens that showcase your differentiators

2. Do you have a visual reference (screenshot) of a landing page style you like?

If you don't have screenshots yet, I'll create image generation prompts for each needed visual.
```

### Visual Reference
If user provides a reference screenshot:
- Analyze design patterns (colors, typography, spacing, components)
- Extract into design.json format

If no reference provided:
- Suggest a style based on product category and target audience
- Create a default design.json appropriate for the product

## Step 7: Final Prompt Generation

Generate a comprehensive prompt for Replit/Lovable. See [references/prompt-template.md](references/prompt-template.md) for full structure.

### Prompt Components

1. **design.json** - Complete design system extracted from reference or generated
2. **Section-by-section specs** - Layout, columns, copy, components, animations
3. **Image prompts** - For each visual, include Midjourney/Nanobanana prompt
4. **Video/animation suggestions** - Where motion would enhance the page

### Image Prompt Format
For each image needed:
```
[Generate] Description for image generation tool
- Style: [realistic/3D/illustration/flat]
- Content: [what should be shown]
- Mood: [professional/friendly/technical/etc.]
- Colors: [reference design.json palette]
```

### Video/Animation Suggestions
Include where appropriate:
- Hero section: Subtle floating animations, parallax
- Feature demos: Short looping videos showing feature in action
- Transitions: Smooth scroll-triggered animations
- Hover states: Micro-interactions on cards and buttons

## Output Format

Final prompt should be copy-paste ready for Replit Agent or Lovable, structured as:

```
[BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
[DESIGN.JSON - complete design system]
[SECTION SPECIFICATIONS - each section with layout, copy, visuals, animations]
[ADDITIONAL NOTES - responsive behavior, interactions, etc.]
```
