# Code Standards

Practical code quality standards with concrete "rules of thumb" - actionable thresholds rather than philosophy.

## Core Principles

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Prefer the simplest solution that works. Avoid "clever" code, magic, and over-engineering.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Remove duplication when it's real duplication. Avoid premature abstraction.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Build features/abstractions only for real, current needs - not hypothetical future ones.

### SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
One module/class/function should have one reason to change.

### Separation of Concerns
Keep UI, domain logic, persistence, integration, and config separated.

### Principle of Least Surprise
Code should behave as a reader expects.

### Fail Fast, Loudly
Validate inputs early; crash with clear errors rather than silently continuing.

## Size Limits

### File Size (Lines of Code)

| Level | LOC | Action |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Target | 100-300 | Ideal |
| Soft limit | 400 | Consider splitting (warning) |
| Hard limit | 800 | Must refactor (critical) |

When a file grows too large, ask what responsibilities got mixed (SRP), then split by domain or feature.

### Function/Method Size

| Level | LOC | Action |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Target | 10-30 | Ideal |
| Soft limit | 50 | Review (warning) |
| Hard limit | 80 | Must refactor (critical) |

If a function cannot be named clearly, it's doing too much.

### Cyclomatic Complexity

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| >10 | Review required |
| >15 | Refactor strongly |
| >20 | Almost always too complex |

## Language-Specific Thresholds

Different languages have different conventions. See `references/language-thresholds.md` for complete per-language limits.

## Naming & Readability

- Prefer clear names over comments
- Use consistent vocabulary (e.g., "user" everywhere, not sometimes "customer")
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally known
- Boolean names: `isEnabled`, `hasAccess`, `shouldRetry`

## Comments & Documentation

- Comment **why**, not **what**
- Don't narrate obvious code
- If code needs a long comment to understand "what", rewrite the code

## Error Handling & Reliability

- Don't swallow errors - log/return them meaningfully
- Use typed errors / error codes consistently
- Add context at boundaries (I/O, API calls)
- Handle retries with backoff + limits; make retry logic explicit

## Testing Guidelines

- Test behavior, not implementation
- Keep unit tests fast; integration tests for boundaries
- Follow the test pyramid:
  - Many unit tests
  - Fewer integration tests
  - Minimal end-to-end tests
- Every bug fix should add a test that would have caught it

## Configuration Best Practices

**What goes to config vs code:**
- **Config**: Environment-specific values (URLs, keys, feature flags, timeouts)
- **Code**: Business rules and behavior

**12-Factor App style:**
- Config in env vars (or config file loaded per env)
- No secrets in git
- Provide defaults (safe) + validation on startup
- Make config observable (print effective config at startup without secrets)

## Architecture / Boundaries

- Keep pure domain logic free of I/O
- Create adapters for DB, external APIs, queues
- Prefer explicit dependencies (DI) over hidden globals/singletons
- Avoid "God objects" - no huge service that does everything

## Git & Code Review Hygiene

- Small PRs (ideally < 300-500 LOC changed)
- Clear commit messages, one logical change per commit
- Review checklist: readability, tests, error handling, security, performance

## Security Basics

- Validate + sanitize external input
- Use parameterized queries
- Principle of least privilege for credentials
- Don't log secrets/PII
- Dependabot/Snyk + lockfile hygiene

## Review Checklist

Quick validation for code reviews:

- [ ] Can I explain this code in 30 seconds?
- [ ] File/function size within limits? If not, is there a clear reason?
- [ ] One responsibility per module/class?
- [ ] No hidden global state / surprising side effects?
- [ ] Errors handled meaningfully (no silent failures)?
- [ ] Config validated; no secrets in repo?
- [ ] Tests cover the important behavior?
- [ ] Formatting/lint/type checks pass?

## Using This Skill

### Analyzing Code

To check code against standards:
1. Read the target file(s)
2. Calculate approximate LOC for file and functions
3. Identify complexity hotspots
4. Report violations using structured table format

### Output Format

Report violations using this table format:

| File | Issue | Severity | Line | Suggestion |
|------|-------|----------|------|------------|
| `src/service.ts` | File exceeds 400 LOC (742) | Warning | - | Split by domain |
| `src/service.ts:45` | Function `processOrder` exceeds 80 LOC (112) | Critical | 45-157 | Extract helper functions |

Severity levels:
- **Info**: Within soft limits but worth noting
- **Warning**: Exceeds soft limits, should address
- **Critical**: Exceeds hard limits, must address

## Additional Resources

### Reference Files

For detailed thresholds and patterns, consult:
- **`references/language-thresholds.md`** - Per-language size limits and conventions
- **`references/refactoring-patterns.md`** - Common refactoring techniques for violations

### Plugin Commands

Use plugin commands for automated analysis:
- `/code-standards:check [path]` - Analyze files
- `/code-standards:fix [path]` - Auto-refactor violations
- `/code-standards:checklist` - Output review checklist
