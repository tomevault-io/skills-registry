description: Manage Spotify playlists, save items to your library, and search the Spotify catalog using the spores Rust CLI. Use this skill when the user asks to create, list, inspect, or modify Spotify playlists, add tracks to playlists, save tracks/albums/playlists to the library, or search for tracks, albums, artists, or playlists on Spotify. Triggers on requests like "create a Spotify playlist", "add songs to my playlist", "save this album", "search Spotify for...", "list my playlists", "what tracks are in this playlist", or any Spotify playlist/library management task. Use when this capability is needed.

# Spores

Spores is a Rust CLI tool for Spotify playlist management and library saving. All output is structured JSON.

## Prerequisites

Before running any command, the user must have:

1. A Spotify developer app registered at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard with a redirect URI of `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
2. A config file at the platform config directory (`~/Library/Application Support/spores/config.toml` on macOS, `~/.config/spores/config.toml` on Linux) containing:

```toml
client_id = "<SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID>"
client_secret = "<SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET>"
# redirect_uri = "http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback"  # optional, this is the default
```

On first run, spores opens a browser for OAuth authorization and caches the token at `config_dir/token_cache.json`. Subsequent runs reuse the cached token.

If the config file does not exist, `spores` creates a template and exits with instructions. If credentials are empty, it exits with an error.

## CLI Command Reference

All commands are run via `cargo run -- <subcommand>` during development or `spores <subcommand>` if installed.

### Search

```
spores search <QUERY> [-t track|album|artist|playlist] [-l LIMIT]
```

- `QUERY` (required): search string
- `-t, --type`: item type to search for (default: `track`)
- `-l, --limit`: max results (default: `20`)

Output shape varies by type. Track example:

```json
{
  "query": "bohemian rhapsody",
  "type": "track",
  "total": 857,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "7tFiyTwD0nx5a1eklYtX2J",
      "name": "Bohemian Rhapsody",
      "artists": ["Queen"],
      "album": "A Night At The Opera",
      "duration_ms": 354947
    }
  ]
}
```

Album items have: `id`, `name`, `artists`, `release_date`.
Artist items have: `id`, `name`, `genres`, `followers`, `popularity`.
Playlist items have: `id`, `name`, `tracks`, `owner`, `url`.

### Playlist List

```
spores playlist list
```

Lists all playlists for the authenticated user (paginates automatically).

```json
{
  "total": 12,
  "playlists": [
    {
      "id": "37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M",
      "name": "Today's Top Hits",
      "tracks": 50,
      "public": true,
      "owner": "spotify",
      "url": "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Playlist Create

```
spores playlist create <NAME> [--public] [-d DESCRIPTION]
```

- `NAME` (required): playlist name
- `--public`: make playlist public (default: private)
- `-d, --description`: optional description

```json
{
  "id": "3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n",
  "name": "Road Trip",
  "public": false,
  "description": "Songs for the drive",
  "url": "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n"
}
```

### Playlist Info

```
spores playlist info <PLAYLIST>
```

- `PLAYLIST` (required): playlist ID or Spotify URI

Returns full playlist details including all tracks:

```json
{
  "id": "3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n",
  "name": "Road Trip",
  "owner": "tirth",
  "public": false,
  "collaborative": false,
  "followers": 0,
  "description": "Songs for the drive",
  "url": "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n",
  "total_tracks": 2,
  "tracks": [
    {
      "type": "track",
      "id": "7tFiyTwD0nx5a1eklYtX2J",
      "name": "Bohemian Rhapsody",
      "artists": ["Queen"],
      "album": "A Night At The Opera",
      "duration_ms": 354947
    }
  ]
}
```

Tracks may also have `"type": "episode"` (with `show` and `duration_ms`) or `"type": "unknown"`.

### Playlist Add

```
spores playlist add <PLAYLIST> <TRACKS>...
```

- `PLAYLIST` (required): playlist ID or Spotify URI
- `TRACKS` (required): one or more track IDs or Spotify URIs

```json
{
  "playlist": "3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n",
  "added": 2,
  "snapshot_id": "MTYsNjM..."
}
```

### Save to Library

```
spores save [-t track|album|playlist] <IDS>...
```

- `-t, --type`: type of item to save (default: `track`)
- `IDS` (required): one or more IDs or Spotify URIs

Saves tracks or albums to the user's "Your Music" library. For playlists, this follows (saves) the playlist.

Track example:

```json
{
  "type": "track",
  "saved": 2,
  "ids": ["7tFiyTwD0nx5a1eklYtX2J", "4u7EnebtmKWzUH433cf5Qv"]
}
```

Album example:

```json
{
  "type": "album",
  "saved": 1,
  "ids": ["6i6folBtxKV28WX3msQ4FE"]
}
```

Playlist example:

```json
{
  "type": "playlist",
  "saved": 1,
  "ids": ["37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M"]
}
```

## Workflow: Creating a Playlist and Adding Tracks

1. Search for tracks to find their IDs:
   ```
   cargo run -- search "bohemian rhapsody" -t track -l 5
   ```
2. Extract the `id` values from the JSON output.
3. Create a new playlist:
   ```
   cargo run -- playlist create "My Playlist" -d "A great playlist"
   ```
4. Extract the playlist `id` from the output.
5. Add tracks to the playlist:
   ```
   cargo run -- playlist add <PLAYLIST_ID> <TRACK_ID_1> <TRACK_ID_2>
   ```
6. Verify with:
   ```
   cargo run -- playlist info <PLAYLIST_ID>
   ```

## Workflow: Inspecting Existing Playlists

1. List all playlists: `cargo run -- playlist list`
2. Pick a playlist ID from the output.
3. Get full details: `cargo run -- playlist info <PLAYLIST_ID>`

## Workflow: Saving Items to Your Library

1. Search for the item to find its ID:
   ```
   cargo run -- search "A Night at the Opera" -t album -l 5
   ```
2. Extract the `id` from the JSON output.
3. Save it:
   ```
   cargo run -- save -t album <ALBUM_ID>
   ```
   For tracks (the default type), the `-t` flag can be omitted:
   ```
   cargo run -- save <TRACK_ID_1> <TRACK_ID_2>
   ```
   For playlists:
   ```
   cargo run -- save -t playlist <PLAYLIST_ID>
   ```

## Key Implementation Details

- **IDs and URIs**: All commands accept both raw IDs (e.g., `7tFiyTwD0nx5a1eklYtX2J`) and full Spotify URIs (e.g., `spotify:track:7tFiyTwD0nx5a1eklYtX2J`).
- **JSON output**: Every command outputs pretty-printed JSON. Errors are also JSON: `{"error": "message"}`.
- **Pagination**: `playlist list` automatically pages through all results.
