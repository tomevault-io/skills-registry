description: Guides test-driven development with red-green-refactor loop. Use when user wants to build features or fix bugs using TDD, mentions "red-green-refactor", wants test-first development, or requests TDD workflow. Don't use for writing tests after implementation, adding tests to existing untested code, or one-off test fixes. Use when this capability is needed.

# Test-Driven Development

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. See [principles.md](references/principles.md) for testing philosophy and mocking guidelines.

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** Each cycle: one test → minimal code to pass → next test. See [examples.md](references/examples.md) for demonstrations.

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

- [ ] Ask user: "What should the public interface look like? Which behaviors are most important to test?"
- [ ] Identify opportunities for [deep modules](references/deep-modules.md) (small interface, deep implementation)
- [ ] Design interfaces for [testability](references/interface-design.md)
- [ ] List behaviors to test (prioritize critical paths — you can't test everything)
- [ ] Get user approval before writing code

### 2. Tracer Bullet

```
RED:   Write first test → fails
GREEN: Minimal code to pass → passes
```

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior:

```
RED:   Write next test → fails
GREEN: Minimal code to pass → passes
```

One test at a time. Minimal code to pass. No refactoring while RED.

### Checklist (each cycle)

- [ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
- [ ] Test uses public interface only
- [ ] Test would survive internal refactor
- [ ] Code is minimal for this test
- [ ] No speculative features added

### 4. Refactor

Once all tests GREEN, look for [refactor candidates](references/refactoring.md):

- [ ] Extract duplication
- [ ] Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- [ ] Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.**

## Anti-Rationalization

| Excuse | Rebuttal |
|---|---|
| "This is too small for TDD" | Small functions have edge cases too. A 1-min test prevents a 30-min debug. |
| "I'll write tests after" | That's not TDD. Tests written after miss the design feedback loop. |
| "The test is obvious, skip RED" | If it's obvious, writing it takes 10 seconds. Skip nothing. |
| "I need to refactor first" | Never refactor while RED. Get to GREEN, then refactor. |
| "Mocking is too complex here" | Complexity in mocking signals a design problem. Simplify the interface. |
| "I'll batch these 3 tests" | One test at a time. Batching hides which change broke what. |

## Error Handling

- If test runner not found → check `package.json` for `test` script; ask user which runner to use
- If tests go RED after refactor → revert immediately and re-attempt in smaller steps
- If a test cannot be made GREEN with minimal code → revisit the interface design with the user
