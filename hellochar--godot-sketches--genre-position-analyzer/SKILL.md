# Genre Position Analyzer

Analyze game concepts using the genre lifecycle model. Identify where genres sit in their lifecycle, assess competitive landscape, and generate strategic recommendations tailored to indie developers.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when asked to:
- Evaluate market positioning for a game concept
- Determine if a genre is oversaturated or emerging
- Find strategic opportunities for indie developers
- Assess competition and differentiation needs
- Decide whether to innovate or iterate

## The Genre Lifecycle Model

Genres follow a predictable lifecycle similar to product adoption curves:

```
                     GENRE LIFECYCLE

    Players/
    Revenue
        │
        │                    ┌────────────┐
        │                   ╱              ╲
        │                  ╱                ╲
        │                 ╱    MATURITY      ╲
        │                ╱                    ╲

        │──╱ INTRO                                    ╲──
        │
        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────► Time
```

### Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Characteristics | Competition | Opportunity |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Introduction** | New mechanics emerge, experimental titles, unclear audience | Very low | High risk, high reward for pioneers |
| **Growth** | Genre crystallizes, audience expands, "genre kings" emerge | Low-Medium | Best time to establish brand |
| **Maturity** | Mechanics standardized, hardcore audience, differentiation via polish | Very high | Expensive to compete, winner-take-all |
| **Decline** | Market consolidates, fewer releases, audience shrinks | Medium | Exit or niche down |
| **Niche** | Small dedicated audience, passion over profit | Low | Sustainable for efficient teams |

## The Six Layers of Innovation

Innovation can happen at different layers, with varying impact and difficulty:

```
INNOVATION LAYERS (bottom = most impactful)
============================================

Layer 6: SETTING/FICTION
  Easy to change, easy to copy
  "It's like X but in space"

Layer 5: STORY/NARRATIVE
  Moderate effort, moderate impact
  "It's like X but with this plot"

Layer 4: SCENARIOS/LEVELS
  Level design, encounters, challenges
  "It's like X but with these missions"

Layer 3: CONTENT/ASSETS
  Art, audio, quantity of stuff
  "It's like X but prettier"

Layer 2: META-GAME MECHANICS
  Progression, unlocks, long-term systems
  "It's like X but with this progression"

Layer 1: CORE MECHANICS ← Most impactful, hardest to copy
  Fundamental gameplay verbs
  "It's NOT like X, it's a new thing"
```

### Strategic Principle

- **Surface innovation** (Layers 4-6): Low risk, low reward, easy to clone
- **Core innovation** (Layers 1-2): High risk, high reward, hard to clone
- **Indies should aim for Layer 1-2 innovation** to create defensible market position

[ ] Audience growing rapidly
[ ] Genre kings emerging
[ ] Clear audience expectations forming
[ ] High media/streamer interest

MATURITY INDICATORS
[ ] Mechanics fully standardized
[ ] Hardcore audience with strong preferences
[ ] Differentiation through polish, not mechanics
[ ] Major studios dominating
[ ] High production value expected
[ ] "Best of genre" lists are definitive

DECLINE INDICATORS

## Example Analysis

```
GAME CONCEPT: "Cozy farming sim with tower defense mechanics"

GENRE POSITION ANALYSIS
=======================

Primary Genre: Farming Sim @ MATURITY
  - Stardew Valley is definitive genre king
  - Conventions fully established
  - High production value expected
  - Audience has clear expectations

Secondary Genre: Tower Defense @ DECLINE/NICHE
  - Peak was 2010s (Plants vs Zombies era)
  - Small dedicated audience remains
  - Low innovation in recent years

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
=====================

Farming Sim Kings:
1. Stardew Valley - Indie benchmark, 20M+ copies
2. Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons - Original franchise
3. Animal Crossing - Adjacent, Nintendo ecosystem

Tower Defense Kings:
1. Bloons TD 6 - Dominates mobile/casual
2. Kingdom Rush series - Polished presentation
3. Plants vs Zombies - Mainstream crossover

Saturation: Farming sims = HIGH, Tower defense = MEDIUM

INNOVATION ANALYSIS
===================

Innovation Layer: Layer 1 (Core Mechanics)
  - Combining two genres at core level
  - Not just "farming with minigames"
  - Fundamental loop integration

Clone Resistance: MEDIUM-HIGH
  - Genre fusion is harder to clone than single-genre polish
  - But can be replicated if proven successful

STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT
====================

Position: Maturity + Decline → DISRUPTION ATTEMPT
Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH

The mature farming sim genre plus the declining TD genre
creates an interesting opportunity for genre fusion that
could carve out a new subgenre/niche.

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

1. LEAN INTO THE FUSION
   Don't make "farming with TD minigame" - make them inseparable
   Crops become towers, farming actions affect defense
   This is your moat

2. COZY FIRST, DEFENSE SECOND
   Farming sim audience expects cozy, non-stressful play
   TD can be intense - solve this tension in design
   Consider: tower defense as optional/preparatory, not real-time stress

3. SCOPE RUTHLESSLY
   Stardew took 4 years solo
   You can't out-content the genre king
   Focus on the unique fusion, not feature parity

4. TARGET FARMING AUDIENCE
   TD audience is smaller and less engaged
   Farming audience will try "farming with a twist"
   Market as farming game with strategic elements

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Trying to match Stardew's content volume
- Real-time stress that breaks cozy feel
- Surface-level fusion (TD as separate minigame)

TEAM FIT: Solo/Small
  This is viable as a focused, scoped-down experience
  2-3 year timeline reasonable
  Risk is acceptable for experienced indie
