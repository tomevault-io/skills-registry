# Prosocial & Cozy Game Analysis Skill

Evaluate game designs against established frameworks for prosocial multiplayer and cozy game design.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when asked to:
- Analyze a game design for prosocial or cozy qualities
- Evaluate multiplayer systems for friendship formation potential
- Identify toxicity risks or anti-patterns in game mechanics
- Review economic systems for prosocial health
- Suggest improvements to make a game more kind/cozy

---

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Kind Values Assessment

Evaluate the design against the three tiers of Kind Values:

#### MUST HAVES (Score 0-10 each)

**Safety Score**: _____/10
- Can players share without fear of mockery/attack?
- Can players opt into (not be forced into) intimacy levels?
- Are there systems to handle toxic behavior?
- Is griefing mechanically difficult or impossible?
- Is communication limited to prevent harassment?

**Interdependence Score**: _____/10
- Do players need each other to succeed?
- Are complementary abilities encouraged?
- Does helping others benefit the helper?
- Are win-win situations common?
- Is solo play possible but cooperative play rewarded?

> **Threshold**: If either Safety or Interdependence < 5, prosocial behavior will be rare regardless of other factors.

#### ACCELERATORS (Score 0-10 each)

**Belonging Score**: _____/10
- Can players form persistent groups?
- Do groups have shared identity markers?
- Can players contribute to shared spaces/projects?
- Is there recognition for community contribution?
- Does the game foster "we" thinking over "me" thinking?

**Trust-Building Score**: _____/10
- Can players predict how others will behave?
- Are social norms reinforced by mechanics?
- Is reputation visible and meaningful?
- Do repeated interactions with same players occur?

#### MAINTENANCE (Score 0-10)

**Toxicity Prevention Score**: _____/10
- Are there moderation tools?
- Is harmful communication limited by design?
- Can players protect themselves from bad actors?
- Are negative behaviors unrewarding or costly?

### Step 2: Cozy Framework Assessment

Evaluate against the three pillars of coziness:

#### SAFETY (Score 0-10)
- Are risks and dangers minimized or opt-in?
- Is failure low-stakes?
- Is the emotional tone secure?
- Can players feel vulnerable without risk?

#### ABUNDANCE (Score 0-10)
- Are basic needs easily met?
- Is there freedom from urgent pressure?
- Are resources generous rather than scarce?
- Is there no fear-of-missing-out?

#### SOFTNESS (Score 0-10)
- Are visuals gentle (soft colors, organic shapes)?
- Is audio calming and non-intrusive?
- Is the pace unhurried?
- Are stimuli gentle rather than intense?

#### Anti-Cozy Violation Check
Mark any present:
- [ ] Pop-up notifications breaking immersion
- [ ] Fear-of-missing-out mechanics (daily rewards, limited events)
- [ ] Urgent timers or appointment mechanics
- [ ] Non-consensual social demands
- [ ] Intense/startling stimuli
- [ ] Competitive pressure
- [ ] Resource scarcity creating anxiety
- [ ] Loss mechanics that punish absence

### Step 3: Friendship Formation Assessment

Evaluate using the Friendship Formula:

**PROXIMITY** (Score 0-10)
- Do players repeatedly encounter the same individuals?
- Are there shared spaces players naturally pass through?
- Can players recognize each other across sessions?
- Is server/group size human-scale (supporting Dunbar's layers)?

**SIMILARITY** (Score 0-10)
- Can players form groups with shared identity?
- Are there shared contexts and goals?
- Can players express similar values/aesthetics?
- Is matchmaking skill-appropriate?

**RECIPROCITY** (Score 0-10)
- Are there meaningful exchange/gift systems?
- Do complementary abilities create mutual benefit?
- Is there visible acknowledgment of help?
- Can players thank or appreciate each other?

**DISCLOSURE** (Score 0-10)
- Are there safe ways to share personal expression?
- Can trust be built gradually?
- Are there opt-in intimacy levels?
- Can players be vulnerable without exploitation?

### Step 4: Economic Health Assessment

**Abundance Design** (Score 0-10)
- Are resources positive-sum where possible?
- Is scarcity used sparingly and intentionally?
- Are per-player or per-group caps used to balance abundance?

**Gift Economy Health** (Score 0-10)
- Does giving benefit the giver?
- Are gifts meaningful but not spammable?
- Is there visible social capital formation?

**Monetization Ethics** (Score 0-10)
- Is monetization transparent?
- Are there hidden costs or delayed reveals?
- Does monetization avoid pay-to-win?
- Are there dark patterns (pay-to-skip, forced grinding, appointment mechanics)?

## Anti-Pattern Detection

### Toxicity Generators (Red Flags)

Mark any present in the design:

**Economic Anti-Patterns**
- [ ] Zero-sum competition for limited resources
- [ ] Power accumulation as only path to safety
- [ ] Making it expensive to help others
- [ ] Making it easy to be selfish without cost
- [ ] Scarcity driving desperate behavior

**Social Anti-Patterns**
- [ ] Unfiltered communication enabling harassment
- [ ] Player collision/physics enabling griefing
- [ ] Visible rankings creating shame
- [ ] Anonymous interactions without accountability
- [ ] Large populations preventing recognition

**Engagement Anti-Patterns**
- [ ] FOMO/loss aversion mechanics
- [ ] Daily login requirements
- [ ] Time-gated content creating obligation
- [ ] Variable reward schedules (slot machine psychology)
- [ ] Social pressure mechanics (visible activity to friends)

**Monetization Anti-Patterns**
- [ ] Pay-to-skip core gameplay
- [ ] Hidden/delayed cost reveals
- [ ] Gacha/lootbox randomness
- [ ] Premium advantages in competitive modes
- [ ] Energy systems limiting free play

## Quick Evaluation Checklist

For rapid assessment, answer these 10 questions:

1. [ ] Can players help each other without cost to themselves?
2. [ ] Is griefing mechanically difficult or impossible?
3. [ ] Do players encounter the same people repeatedly?
4. [ ] Can players form persistent groups with identity?
5. [ ] Is there a gift/exchange system?
6. [ ] Are resources abundant rather than scarce?
7. [ ] Is the pace unhurried with no urgency mechanics?
8. [ ] Is communication limited to prevent harassment?
9. [ ] Is monetization transparent and non-predatory?
10. [ ] Can players feel safe being vulnerable?

**Score**: X/10 "Yes" answers

- 8-10: Strong prosocial/cozy foundation
- 5-7: Moderate foundation with room for improvement
- 3-4: Significant concerns requiring redesign
- 0-2: Likely to produce toxic/stressful experiences

## Dunbar Layer Reference

When evaluating social scale:

| Layer | Size | Design Implication |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Intimate | 5 | Private spaces, deep trust mechanics |
| Close | 15 | Guild core, regular collaborators |
| Friends | 50 | Guild/clan, recognized allies |
| Acquaintances | 150 | Server population cap for recognition |

Servers/groups exceeding 150 active players make repeated encounters rare, harming friendship formation.
