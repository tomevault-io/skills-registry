# Memory Engine v1.6

A memory and learning system for Claude Code, built with hooks and markdown.

## Modules

### 1. Smart Context

Auto-detects the current project from your working directory and loads its memory.

- Resolves per-project memory directory automatically — no hardcoded paths
- Implementation: `~/.claude/scripts/hooks/session-start.js`
- Config: `references/smart-context.md`

### 2. Auto Learn (Pitfall Detection)

Detects pitfall patterns before context compression — retries, errors followed by fixes, user corrections.

- Saves both the problem and the fix to `~/.claude/skills/learned/`
- Same mistake 3+ times across different days → suggests writing it into permanent rules
- Implementation: `shared-utils.js` → `detectPitfalls()` + `savePitfalls()`

### 3. Student Loop (/reflect)

8-step learning cycle. First 3 steps are automatic (every session). Last 5 via `/reflect`.

1. Takes notes — records what was done, files changed, decisions made
2. Links them — tags the project, connects to previous notes
3. Spots patterns — scans for pitfall signals

There is no real "end" to a Claude Code conversation. Memory Engine saves at three points:
- **Every 20 messages** (`mid-session-checkpoint`) — most reliable, self-counted
- **Before context compression** (`pre-compact`) — pitfall detection runs here, context is fullest
- **When conversation ends** (`session-end`) — best-effort, not guaranteed to fire

You don't need to remember to run any command before closing.
4. Review — read past 7 days, mark useful vs outdated
5. Refine — 4-question decision tree (Keep? Condense? Already covered? Delete as last resort)
6. Re-study — re-analyze cleaned data for buried patterns
7. Slim down — list removable items, wait for user confirmation
8. Wrap up — produce a report

### 4. Session Handoff (/handoff)

Pass context between Claude Code windows without losing progress.

- `/handoff` saves a `handoff-*.md` file with progress, decisions, unfinished tasks
- Next session auto-detects it on startup (`session-start.js`)
- Mid-conversation detection via `memory-sync.js`
- Each handoff is shown once, tracked by `.handoff-read.json`

### 5. Correction Cycle (/analyze)

Learns from user corrections — mistakes that don't show up in error logs.

- **Analyze** (`/analyze`) — compare user's edits against rules, log missed rules, distill new ones
- **Correct** (auto, before tasks) — scan the error list as a reminder
- **Reflect** (`/reflect` step 6) — same mistake 3+ times → upgrade to hard rule

## Hooks

| Hook | File | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :----------- |
| SessionStart | session-start.js | Load last summary + project memory + pending handoffs + pitfall review + /reflect reminder |
| SessionEnd | session-end.js | Save summary + project index + backup (best-effort, may not fire) |
| PreCompact | pre-compact.js | Snapshot + pitfall detection + backup — the real safety net |
| UserPromptSubmit | memory-sync.js | Cross-session memory change detection + handoff detection |
| UserPromptSubmit | mid-session-checkpoint.js | Checkpoint every 20 messages |
| PreToolUse(Write) | write-guard.js | Sensitive file write warning |
| PreToolUse(Bash) | pre-push-check.js | Safety check before git push |
| — | memory-backup.sh | Bidirectional sync script (push/pull/sync) — v1.6 |

Shared logic between `session-end.js` and `pre-compact.js` is extracted into `shared-utils.js`.

## Core Principles

### Test what you build

- After creating any hook or feature, always run a test to confirm it works
- "Written" does not mean "done" — see actual output before marking complete

### /reflect 4-question decision tree

1. Does it serve the main purpose? → No → remove
2. Can it be condensed? → Yes → replace with refined version
3. Already covered by an existing rule? → Yes → don't duplicate
4. Delete is the last resort → only if Q1-Q3 don't apply

## Troubleshooting

### MEMORY.md over 200 lines with no warning

- **Cause:** Didn't check line count before writing
- **Fix:** Run `wc -l` before every write. Over 170 lines → move old content to standalone files first

### Memory saved but next session doesn't know

- **Cause:** Content written directly into MEMORY.md instead of creating a pointer
- **Fix:** MEMORY.md holds pointers only. Details go in `memory/*.md`

### Backup push fails

- **Cause:** Conflicts in the memory repo or expired auth
- **Fix:** Run `git pull` first, resolve conflicts if any

### Memory from another device not showing up

- **Cause:** Backup was push-only. Device A pushes to GitHub, but Device B never pulls it back into its local `projects/` directories
- **Fix:** v1.6 adds `pull` and `sync` modes to `memory-backup.sh`. The pull distributes global memory files from the backup repo into every local project directory that has a `memory/` folder (newer file wins, won't overwrite local changes)
- **Root cause:** Each device has different working directories, so `projects/` paths differ. Global memory must be actively distributed, not just stored in one place
