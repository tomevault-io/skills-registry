<workflow>
<step name="Preparation/Initial Setup">
[Detailed instructions for the first step. Use imperative form (commands).]

- Check that [prerequisite] is available
- Verify [condition] is met
- Gather [required information]

**Example:**
```bash
# Command to verify setup
tool --version

# Command to check prerequisites
tool check --all
```
</step>

<step name="Main Process/Core Action">

1. Execute [specific action]
2. Monitor [specific indicator]
3. Validate [expected condition]

**Important Considerations:**
- [Key decision point or branching logic]
- [Edge case to handle]
- [Safety check or validation]

**Example:**
```python
# Example code showing this step
def main_process():
    """Core implementation of the skill's main action."""
    # Step-by-step implementation
    result = perform_action()
    validate(result)
    return result
```
</step>

<step name="Validation/Verification">
[Instructions for confirming success.]

Verify the process completed successfully by:

1. Checking [specific output or indicator]
2. Confirming [expected state or condition]
3. Running [validation command or test]

**Expected Outcomes:**
- [Specific success criterion 1]
- [Specific success criterion 2]

**Example:**
```bash
# Validation commands
tool verify --output
tool status --check-all
```
</step>

<step name="Follow-up/Cleanup">
[Any additional steps needed after main process.]

- Clean up [temporary resources]

<template_usage_notes>
**REMOVE THIS SECTION** when creating your actual skill. This guidance is only for template users.

<subsection name="Key Principles">
1. **Concise and Actionable**: Every sentence should provide value. Remove fluff.

2. **Imperative Form**: Write as commands ("Do this", "Check that") not descriptions.

3. **Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Frontmatter metadata: ~50-100 tokens (always in context)
   - SKILL.md body: 2,000-5,000 tokens (loaded when skill triggered)
   - Supporting resources: Variable (loaded on-demand)

4. **Concrete Examples**: One good example > 10 paragraphs of explanation.

5. **Appropriate Specificity**:
   - **High freedom**: Provide principles, options, and trade-offs
   - **Medium freedom**: Show preferred patterns with acceptable alternatives
   - **Low freedom**: Give exact procedures with safety checks

6. **Test with Real Tasks**: Validate effectiveness with actual agent workflows.
</subsection>

<subsection name="Template Customization">
**Required Sections:**
- objective
- when_to_use

- best_practices

**Optional Sections** (remove if not applicable):

- [ ] "When to Use" section has specific scenarios
- [ ] Instructions in imperative form
- [ ] At least 2 concrete, runnable examples
- [ ] Token estimate provided
- [ ] Tested with real agent tasks
- [ ] Agent successfully uses skill when appropriate
- [ ] "Template Usage Notes" section removed
</subsection>

<subsection name="File Organization">

<subsection name="Common Mistakes">
- **Too verbose**: Including information agents already have
- **Too vague**: Not providing specific, actionable guidance
- **Missing examples**: Only explaining conceptually
- **Poor triggering**: Description doesn't clearly indicate when to use
- **Resource bloat**: Including everything instead of loading on-demand
- **No testing**: Creating without validating with real agents
</subsection>

<subsection name="Ready to Create Your Skill?">
1. Copy this template: `cp -r skills/custom/template skills/custom/your-skill-name`
2. Update frontmatter with your skill's details
3. Replace template content with your skill's content
4. Add supporting resources if needed
5. Test with target agents
6. Iterate based on usage
7. Remove "Template Usage Notes" section
8. Add to your project's skill catalog

Good luck!
