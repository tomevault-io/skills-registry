# APM Integration Skill (Optional)

> **Note**: This skill is for teams that prefer APM's compiled `AGENTS.md` approach over the default Agent Skills auto-loading. Most users should use Agent Skills directly—see [docs/agent-skills.md](../../../docs/agent-skills.md).

This skill generates the AGENTS.md guardrails file by installing APM packages and synthesizing engineering standards.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill ONLY if you:
- Need a single compiled `AGENTS.md` file at the project root
- Are sharing standards via APM packages with other teams
- Have existing APM packages you want to incorporate
- Prefer explicit compilation over auto-loading skills

**If you're using the default Agent Skills approach, you don't need this skill.**

## Agent Skills vs APM

| Approach | How It Works | Use When |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Agent Skills** (Default) | Skills in `.github/skills/` auto-load by context | Most projects |
| **APM** (This Skill) | Compiles packages to single `AGENTS.md` | Sharing standards via packages |

## What is AGENTS.md?

AGENTS.md is a consolidated file containing all engineering standards and guidelines. It's generated from APM (Agent Package Manager) packages that contain modular, reusable engineering standards.

## Workflow

### 1. Check APM Installation
```bash
if ! command -v apm &> /dev/null; then
    echo "APM not found. Installing APM CLI..."
    curl -sSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmeppiel/apm/main/install.sh" | sh
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

### 2. Set Up apm.yml

Copy the template if you don't have an apm.yml:
```bash
cp templates/apm.yml.template apm.yml
```

### 3. Install APM Packages
```bash
apm install
```

This command:
- Reads `apm.yml` for package dependencies
- Downloads engineering standards from GitHub repositories
- Installs packages into `apm_modules/`
- Supports semantic versioning (e.g., `@1.0.0` or `@latest`)

### 4. Generate AGENTS.md
```bash
apm compile
```

This command:
- Scans `.apm/instructions/` in all installed packages
- Consolidates rules based on file pattern matching (`applyTo`)
- Creates comprehensive `AGENTS.md` at project root

## APM Configuration

The `apm.yml` file defines which packages to install:

```yaml
name: your-project-name
version: 1.0.0

dependencies:
  apm:
    - EmeaAppGbb/azure-standards@latest
    - EmeaAppGbb/python-backend@latest  # if using Python
    - EmeaAppGbb/react-frontend@latest  # if using React
```

## Expected Output

After running the commands:
- `apm_modules/` directory with installed packages
- `AGENTS.md` file at project root with consolidated standards

## AGENTS.md Structure

The generated AGENTS.md typically includes:
- General engineering principles
- Code quality standards
- Testing requirements
- Documentation guidelines
- Security best practices
- Technology-specific guidelines (backend, frontend)

## When to Regenerate

Run `apm compile` again when:
- Adding new APM packages
- Updating package versions
- Standards have been updated upstream

## Templates

See `templates/agents-template.md` for the expected AGENTS.md structure.

## Sample Output

See `examples/sample-agents-md.md` for an example of generated AGENTS.md content.
