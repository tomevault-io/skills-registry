# Spec Validation Skill

This skill validates generated specifications (PRDs, FRDs, ADRs) against standards and best practices to ensure quality, completeness, and consistency.

## When to Use This Skill

- Validating PRD quality and completeness
- Reviewing FRD specifications
- Checking ADR format and content
- Ensuring traceability between documents
- Quality gating before implementation

## Validation Workflow

### 1. Document Discovery
- Locate all specification files
- `specs/prd.md` - Product Requirements
- `specs/features/*.md` - Feature Requirements
- `specs/adr/*.md` - Architecture Decisions

### 2. Run Validation Checks
- Format and structure validation
- Content completeness checks
- Cross-reference verification
- Quality scoring

### 3. Generate Report
- List all findings
- Severity levels (Error, Warning, Info)
- Recommendations for fixes

## Validation Checklists

### PRD Validation
See `checklists/prd-checklist.md`:
- [ ] Purpose section clearly defines the problem
- [ ] Scope defines in-scope and out-of-scope items
- [ ] Goals have measurable success criteria
- [ ] Requirements use [REQ-X] numbering
- [ ] User stories follow Gherkin format
- [ ] Assumptions and constraints documented
- [ ] No technical implementation details (WHAT not HOW)

### FRD Validation
See `checklists/frd-checklist.md`:
- [ ] Feature ID links to PRD requirement
- [ ] Inputs and outputs clearly defined
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Technical constraints documented
- [ ] Integration points mapped
- [ ] Traceability to PRD maintained

### ADR Validation
See `checklists/adr-checklist.md`:
- [ ] Uses MADR format
- [ ] Context clearly explains the problem
- [ ] At least 3 options considered
- [ ] Decision drivers documented
- [ ] Rationale explains why option was chosen
- [ ] Consequences (positive/negative) listed
- [ ] Sequential numbering maintained

## Quality Scoring

### Scoring Criteria

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 100% | All checks pass, exemplary documentation |
| 80-99% | Minor issues, ready for implementation |
| 60-79% | Some issues need attention |
| <60% | Significant issues, requires revision |

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Error | Blocks implementation | Must fix |
| Warning | Quality concern | Should fix |
| Info | Improvement suggestion | Nice to have |

## Validation Report Format

# Specification Validation Report

**Date:** [Date]
**Documents Validated:** [Count]
**Overall Score:** [X]%

## Summary
- Errors: [X]
- Warnings: [X]
- Info: [X]

## PRD Validation
**File:** specs/prd.md
**Score:** [X]%

### Errors
- [ERROR] [Description] - Line [X]

### Warnings
- [WARNING] [Description] - Line [X]

## FRD Validation
[Similar format for each FRD]

## ADR Validation
[Similar format for each ADR]

## Recommendations
1. [Recommendation]
2. [Recommendation]

## Common Issues

### PRD Issues
- Missing success metrics
- Technical details in requirements (HOW vs WHAT)
- Vague acceptance criteria
- Missing stakeholder information

### FRD Issues
- No traceability to PRD
- Missing acceptance criteria
- Unclear dependencies
- No testing requirements

### ADR Issues
- Single option considered
- Missing rationale
- Vague consequences
- No references to requirements

## Integration with Workflow

- Run after PRD creation (before FRD)
- Run after FRD creation (before planning)
- Run after ADR creation (before implementation)
- Gate quality before handoff to next agent

## Checklists

See `checklists/` directory for detailed validation checklists.
