# Debugging & Root Cause Analysis

You are a detective, not a guesser. You form hypotheses from evidence, test them, and narrow down. You never shotgun-fix by changing random things.

## When to use
- Any error, crash, or unexpected behavior
- Test failures (local or CI)
- Performance regressions
- Production incidents
- "It works on my machine" problems

## The Debugging Protocol

### 1. REPRODUCE (before anything else)
- Can you trigger the bug reliably?
- What are the exact steps, inputs, and environment?
- If intermittent: what's the frequency? What varies between runs?

### 2. ISOLATE
- What changed since it last worked? (`git log --oneline -20`, `git diff`)
- Is it environment-specific? (iOS vs Android, debug vs release, local vs prod)
- Does it fail with minimal input? (reduce the test case)

### 3. HYPOTHESIZE (only after evidence gathering)
- Form 2-3 specific hypotheses
- For each: what would you expect to see if this hypothesis is correct?
- Test the easiest-to-disprove hypothesis first

### 4. VERIFY
- Add targeted logging or breakpoints
- Check one variable at a time
- When you find the cause, verify by reverting the fix — does the bug return?

### 5. FIX & PROTECT
- Fix the root cause, not the symptom
- Add a test that would have caught this
- Consider: are there similar bugs elsewhere? (same pattern, different location)

## Flutter-Specific Debugging

### Common Failures
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `type 'Null' is not a subtype` | Missing null check on JSON field | Add null-aware operator or default value in Freezed model |
| `setState() called after dispose()` | Async callback on unmounted widget | Check `mounted` before setState, or use Riverpod (auto-disposes) |
| `RenderFlex overflowed` | Content too wide/tall | Wrap in `Flexible`, `Expanded`, or `SingleChildScrollView` |
| `MissingPluginException` | Native plugin not registered | `flutter clean && flutter pub get`, rebuild |
| Build runner errors | Stale generated code | `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` |
| Provider not found | Missing `ProviderScope` ancestor | Wrap app root in `ProviderScope` |

### Performance Debugging
```bash
# Profile mode (real device only)
flutter run --profile

# DevTools
flutter pub global activate devtools
dart devtools
```
- **Jank**: Check for expensive `build()` methods, unnecessary rebuilds
- **Memory**: Look for retained references, unclosed streams/controllers
- **Startup**: Profile with `Timeline.startSync()` / `Timeline.finishSync()`

## Edge Function Debugging

### Check Logs First
```
get_logs(service: "edge-function")  # Last 24h via MCP
```

### Common Failures
| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Boot failure` | Syntax error or bad import | Check import paths, run locally first |
| `Worker exceeded resource limits` | Timeout or memory | Optimize query, add pagination |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing/invalid JWT | Check `verify_jwt` setting, validate token |
| `CORS error` in browser | Missing CORS headers | Add `corsHeaders` to response + OPTIONS handler |
| `Connection refused` to Postgres | Wrong connection method | Use Supabase client, not direct connection from edge |

### Local Testing
```bash
supabase functions serve my_function --env-file .env.local
# Then: curl -X POST http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/my_function
```

## Git Bisect (Finding When It Broke)
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad              # Current commit is broken
git bisect good abc123      # This commit was known-good
# Git checks out middle commit — test it, then:
git bisect good  # or  git bisect bad
# Repeat until Git identifies the exact commit
git bisect reset            # Done, return to original branch
```

## Log Reading Heuristics
- Read the **first** error in a cascade, not the last — later errors are often consequences
- Stack traces: read **bottom-up** for the call chain, but the **top frame** is where it failed
- Search for the **second occurrence** of an error — the first is often a red herring during startup
- `null` or `undefined` appearing where an object is expected → trace back to where that value was set

## Anti-Patterns (Things That Waste Time)
- Changing multiple things at once — you won't know which fixed it
- Adding `print()` statements everywhere — use targeted breakpoints or structured logging
- Googling the error before reading it — the message often tells you exactly what's wrong
- Assuming the bug is in library code — it's almost always in your code
- Fixing the symptom without understanding the cause — it will come back
