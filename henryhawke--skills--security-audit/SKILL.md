# Security Auditing

You audit for exploitability, not theoretical risk. Every finding includes proof-of-concept severity, not just "this could be bad." You prioritize by blast radius: auth bypass > data leak > denial of service > information disclosure.

## When to use
- Audit a codebase or feature for security vulnerabilities
- Review authentication and authorization logic
- Check for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Verify Supabase RLS policies are correct
- Scan for exposed secrets or insecure dependencies
- Set up security scanning in CI/CD

## Audit Workflow

### 1. Attack Surface Mapping
- List all entry points: API endpoints, Edge Functions, client-side forms
- Identify auth boundaries: which endpoints are public, which require auth?
- Map data flows: where does user input go? Where does sensitive data live?
- Check third-party integrations: webhooks, OAuth providers, payment processors

### 2. Authentication & Authorization Review
```
For each endpoint:
  ✓ Is authentication required? (verify_jwt, auth middleware)
  ✓ Is the authenticated user authorized for this action? (RLS, role check)
  ✓ Can a user escalate privileges? (modify user_id in request body)
  ✓ Are tokens validated correctly? (signature, expiration, audience)
```

### 3. Input Validation Audit
```
For each user input:
  ✓ Is it validated before use? (type, length, format)
  ✓ Is it sanitized before database insertion? (SQL injection)
  ✓ Is it sanitized before HTML rendering? (XSS)
  ✓ Can oversized input cause DoS? (file uploads, JSON payloads)
```

### 4. Supabase-Specific Checks
```sql
-- Tables without RLS (CRITICAL)
SELECT schemaname, tablename FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename NOT IN (
  SELECT relname FROM pg_class WHERE relrowsecurity = true
);

-- Tables with RLS enabled but NO policies (data is inaccessible)
SELECT c.relname FROM pg_class c
WHERE c.relrowsecurity = true
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies p WHERE p.tablename = c.relname);
```

Also run: `get_advisors(type: "security")` via MCP after any DDL change.

### 5. Secret Scanning
```bash
# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -rn "sk_live\|sk_test\|supabase_service_role\|SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\|password\s*=" --include="*.ts" --include="*.dart" --include="*.json" .

# Check .gitignore covers sensitive files
# These should NEVER be committed:
# .env, .env.local, .env.production
# *-credentials.json, service-account-key.json
# *.p8, *.p12 (Apple signing keys)
```

### 6. Dependency Audit
```bash
# Flutter
flutter pub outdated
# Check for known vulnerabilities in pubspec.lock

# Node/Bun
npm audit      # or
bun pm audit   # if available
```

## OWASP Top 10 Quick Check

| # | Vulnerability | What to Look For |
|---|---|---|
| A01 | Broken Access Control | Missing auth checks, IDOR (user A sees user B's data), missing RLS |
| A02 | Cryptographic Failures | Hardcoded keys, weak hashing, HTTP instead of HTTPS |
| A03 | Injection | Unparameterized SQL, unsanitized HTML output, command injection |
| A04 | Insecure Design | Missing rate limiting, no account lockout, predictable tokens |
| A05 | Security Misconfiguration | Default credentials, verbose errors in production, open CORS |
| A06 | Vulnerable Components | Outdated dependencies with known CVEs |
| A07 | Auth Failures | Weak passwords allowed, no MFA, session fixation |
| A08 | Data Integrity Failures | No webhook signature verification, insecure deserialization |
| A09 | Logging Failures | Logging passwords/tokens, no audit trail for sensitive ops |
| A10 | SSRF | User-controlled URLs fetched server-side without validation |

## Output Format

```
## Security Audit Report

### Critical (Exploit Now)
- [Finding + proof of concept + fix]

### High (Exploit with Effort)
- [Finding + conditions + fix]

### Medium (Defense in Depth)
- [Finding + risk + recommendation]

### Verified Secure
- [What you checked and confirmed is correctly implemented]
```

## Common Supabase Security Mistakes
1. **`verify_jwt: false`** on Edge Function without alternative auth
2. **Missing RLS** on tables with user data
3. **Service role key** referenced in client-side code
4. **Webhook endpoints** without signature verification (Apple S2S, Stripe)
5. **RLS policy using `auth.uid() = user_id`** but the `user_id` column is user-writable
6. **Overly permissive CORS** (`*`) on authenticated endpoints
