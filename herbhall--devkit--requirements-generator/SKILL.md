name: requirements-generator
description: Creates and maintains requirements.md files for programming projects using industry-standard practices. Optionally generates REQUIREMENTS_QUESTIONS.md to capture open decisions and trade-offs using ADR/RFC patterns. Use when starting a new project, updating requirements as scope changes, or reviewing existing requirements documents.

<essential_principles>

**MoSCoW Prioritization**

- **Must have**: Critical requirements without which the project fails
- **Should have**: Important but not critical; workarounds exist
- **Could have**: Nice-to-have features; include if time permits
- **Won't have (this release)**: Explicitly out of scope

**Requirements Quality Criteria**
Every requirement must be:

- **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous language
- **Measurable**: Verifiable through testing or observation
- **Achievable**: Technically feasible within constraints
- **Relevant**: Aligned with project goals
- **Traceable**: Linked to a business need or user story

**Version Control**

- Track all changes with version numbers (MAJOR.MINOR)
- MAJOR: Scope changes, new features, removed requirements
- MINOR: Clarifications, refinements, acceptance criteria updates
- Maintain changelog at top of document

**Document Structure**
All requirements.md files follow this structure:

1. Project Overview
2. Stakeholders and Constraints
3. Functional Requirements
4. Non-Functional Requirements
5. Technical Requirements
6. Acceptance Criteria
7. Out of Scope
8. Changelog

</essential_principles>

<intake>
**requirements-generator triggered.** What would you like to do?

1. **Create new requirements** - Start a new requirements.md from scratch
2. **Update requirements** - Modify existing requirements as scope changes
3. **Review requirements** - Audit requirements for completeness and quality

Type a number, keyword, or **skip** to dismiss.

> Note: This skill blocks on user input. If triggered unintentionally,
> type **skip** or **dismiss** to cancel.
</intake>

<routing>
| Response | Workflow |
|----------|----------|
| 1, "create requirements", "new requirements", "start requirements" | workflows/create-requirements.md |
| 2, "update requirements", "modify requirements", "change requirements" | workflows/update-requirements.md |
| 3, "review requirements", "audit requirements", "check requirements" | workflows/review-requirements.md |

If the user types **skip** or **dismiss**, briefly confirm cancellation (e.g., "requirements-generator cancelled.") and end the skill without running any workflow.

If the input does not clearly match any option above and is not "skip" or "dismiss", respond:
"requirements-generator was triggered but your input didn't match a workflow. Options: 1-3 (listed above). Type **skip** to dismiss."

**After reading the workflow, follow it exactly.**
</routing>

<success_criteria>
A complete requirements.md has:

- [ ] Valid version number and changelog
- [ ] All sections from document structure
- [ ] Every requirement prioritized (MoSCoW)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria for all Must/Should requirements
