# SEO Copywriter

Write conversion-focused, search-optimized web content.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify** - target keyword, audience, content type, tone
2. **Write** - apply SEO principles below
3. **Analyze** - run `scripts/analyze.py` on draft
4. **Refine** - address recommendations, re-analyze

## SEO Writing Principles

### Keywords
- Primary keyword in: first 100 words, H1, 1-2 subheadings, conclusion
- Keyword density: 1-2% (script checks this)
- Use LSI (related) keywords naturally
- Never stuff - write for humans first

### Structure
- H1: one per page, include primary keyword
- H2/H3: logical hierarchy, keywords where natural
- Paragraphs: 2-4 sentences max for web
- Sentences: avg 15-20 words, vary length
- Bullet points for scannable content

### Readability
- Target Flesch-Kincaid grade 6-8 for general audience
- Use active voice (aim <15% passive)
- Simple words over complex alternatives
- Break long sentences

### Engagement
- Questions engage readers
- Power words trigger emotion (see `references/power-words.md`)
- Address reader directly ("you", "your")
- Include CTAs

### Meta Content
| Element | Length | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Title tag | 50-60 chars | Primary keyword near start |
| Meta description | 150-160 chars | Include keyword, CTA |
| URL slug | 3-5 words | Hyphenated, keyword |
| H1 | 20-70 chars | Match/relate to title |

## Analysis Script

Run after writing to check metrics:

```bash
# From file
python3 scripts/analyze.py content.txt

# From clipboard (macOS)
pbpaste | python3 scripts/analyze.py -

# Pipe text
echo "Your content here" | python3 scripts/analyze.py -
```

**Script checks:**
- Word count, frequency, percentages
- Character count (with/without spaces)
- Word pairs & triples (find repeated phrases)
- Sentence/paragraph length stats
- Flesch-Kincaid readability
- Passive voice percentage
- Power word density
- Question count
- Automated recommendations

## Content-Type Guidelines

### Landing Pages
- Lead with benefit, not feature
- One primary CTA above fold
- Social proof near CTA
- Address objections
- Urgency without being pushy

### Blog Posts
- Hook in first sentence
- Deliver value promised in title
- Internal linking to related content
- End with CTA or next step

### Product Descriptions
- Benefits > features (but include both)
- Sensory language
- Overcome objections
- Include specs for SEO

## References

- `references/power-words.md` - Categorized power words for emotional triggers
