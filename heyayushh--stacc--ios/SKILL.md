# iOS Stack Skill

## Default guidance

Use the focused sub-skills in this folder based on the task type.

## Workflow (use this order)

1. Classify the task (UI pattern, performance, refactor, concurrency, debugging).
2. Load the matching sub-skill(s) and follow their procedure.
3. Make changes with minimal scope; prefer small, testable steps.
4. Validate on simulator/device and check logs.
5. Add or update previews/tests when applicable.

## Review Checklist

- Correct sub-skill chosen and applied.
- SwiftUI view body is simple; state is minimal and predictable.
- Concurrency uses structured tasks; avoids unstructured `Task {}` leaks.
- Performance red flags (layout thrash, heavy body recompute) addressed.
- Debugging notes captured if the issue is intermittent or device-specific.

## Local Resources (sub-skills)

- `swiftui-ui-patterns/SKILL.md` for SwiftUI layout and interaction patterns.
- `swiftui-liquid-glass/SKILL.md` for Liquid Glass visual style and implementation.
- `swiftui-performance-audit/SKILL.md` for performance profiling and optimization checklists.
- `swiftui-view-refactor/SKILL.md` for refactoring and view decomposition workflows.
- `swift-concurrency-expert/SKILL.md` for structured concurrency and async/await guidance.
- `ios-debugger-agent/SKILL.md` for debugging, crash triage, and device/simulator diagnostics.
