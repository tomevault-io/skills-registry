# Engineering Figure Agent For Claude Code

Use this skill for the figure-production layer after the figure goal is reasonably clear.

If the figure claim, panel logic, or caption argument is still unclear, first use a research-writing or paper-analysis workflow to settle the scientific message.

## Core Decision

- Use `image mode` for conceptual figures: system architecture, algorithm workflow, graphical abstract, hardware block diagram, or reference-inspired redraw.
- Use `plot mode` for exact values: benchmark bars, ablation plots, trend curves, heatmaps, scatter plots, or multi-panel quantitative figures.
- Use `mixed` when exact plot panels should be rendered locally and conceptual panels should be generated or described separately.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the user's paper context, data, caption draft, or figure brief.
2. Create or normalize a figure brief with `figure_goal`, `paper_claim`, `figure_type`, `mode`, `panels`, `must_keep_labels`, `data`, `style_constraints`, `output_formats`, and `verification_checklist`.
3. If numeric truth matters and data is missing, ask for values instead of inventing them.
4. For image mode, produce a final prompt using concise labels, white background, publication style, and faithful technical terms.
5. For plot mode, produce a concise plot-request JSON. Use `data.series[]` for multi-series scatter plots, and use outside or dedicated legends for dense annotated charts.
6. Keep real API keys outside the repository.
7. Require explicit user opt-in before sending API keys, prompts, or files to third-party provider endpoints.
8. For high-resolution or final-export requests, fail closed if the configured high-resolution path is unavailable instead of silently downgrading.
9. Treat generated diagrams as drafts until labels, scientific claims, and numeric values are verified.

## Output Files

Prefer these files when writing to disk:

```text
figure-brief.md
prompt.txt
plot-request.json
output/
```

## Quality Rules

- Do not fabricate measurements, benchmark improvements, device values, or unsupported causal claims.
- Keep labels readable at paper width.
- Preserve standard English symbols and formulas in Chinese figures when they improve clarity.
- Never use image generation for exact numeric chart geometry.
- Do not present light figure critique as a full reviewer-style paper-figure audit.
