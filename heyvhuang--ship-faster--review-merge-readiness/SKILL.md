description: Request/execute structured code review: use after completing important tasks, at end of each execution batch, or before merge. Based on git diff range, compare against plan and requirements, output issue list by Critical/Important/Minor severity, and provide clear verdict on merge readiness.

# Requesting Code Review (Structured Review: Requirements Alignment + Production Readiness)

Goal: Make code review a repeatable process, not random comments.

**Core principle: Review early, review often.**

## When Review is Required

**Mandatory:**
- After completing important features
- After each batch in `workflow-execute-plans` ends (default 3 tasks per batch)
- Before merging to main branch

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (get a fresh perspective)
- Before major refactoring (establish baseline first)
- After fixing complex bugs (verify no new regressions)

## How to Initiate (Minimum Information Set)

### 1) Determine Review Scope (git SHA)

Prefer using "baseline before plan/task started" as `BASE_SHA`:

```bash
# Common approach: use main as baseline
BASE_SHA=$(git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master)
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

If you want to review just the most recent commit within a small task:

```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

### 2) Prepare Review Basis (Plan / Requirements)

Review must provide:
- **WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED**: What you just completed (1-3 bullet points)
- **PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS**: Corresponding plan excerpt or requirements document path (e.g., `run_dir/03-plans/features/<feature_slug>-plan.md`)

### 3) Get diff (Evidence)

```bash
git diff --stat "$BASE_SHA..$HEAD_SHA"
git diff "$BASE_SHA..$HEAD_SHA"
```

## Review Execution Methods (Choose One)

### Method A: Sub-Agent Review (if your system supports it)

Use template: `review-merge-readiness/code-reviewer.md`, fill in placeholders and execute.

### Method B: Self Review (works without sub-agent)

Check each item per template checklist and output same structured result (Strengths + Issues by severity + Verdict).

## Review Output Format (Must Be Structured)

Output must include:
- **Strengths**: Specific positives (at least 1)
- **Issues**: Categorized by severity:
  - **Critical (Must Fix)**: Security/data loss/functionality bugs/would cause production incidents
  - **Important (Should Fix)**: Obviously poor architecture/missing error handling/test gaps/requirements misalignment
  - **Minor (Nice to Have)**: Style/small optimizations/documentation polish
- **Assessment**: Merge readiness (Yes/No/With fixes) + 1-2 sentence technical reasoning

Each Issue must include:
- Location: `file:line`
- What's wrong
- Why it matters
- How to fix (provide minimal change suggestion)

## Relationship with Other Review Skills

- `review-clean-code`: More focused on "maintainability/cleanliness", suitable for deep code smell investigation
- `review-react-best-practices`: More focused on React/Next.js performance patterns (waterfalls/bundle/re-renders). Use when the diff touches React UI, data fetching, or performance-sensitive areas.
- This skill: More focused on "requirements alignment/production readiness/merge verdict" conclusion-oriented review

If you just need a "can we merge?" verdict: use this skill.
If you want a deep health check: additionally invoke `review-clean-code`.
