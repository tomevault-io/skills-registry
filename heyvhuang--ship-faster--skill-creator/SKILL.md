# Skill Creator

Build skills that behave like “mini senior engineers”: trigger correctly, run deterministically, and leave resumable artifacts on disk.

## What good looks like (Ship Faster standard)

- `SKILL.md`: short and triggerable (routing + safety + I/O + output contract). Avoid long tutorials here.
- `references/`: deep docs loaded only when needed (progressive disclosure). Link directly from `SKILL.md`.
- `scripts/`: deterministic helpers for repetitive/fragile work (prefer this over re-writing code in chat).
- `assets/`: templates or files to copy (not meant to be loaded into context).

Deep guidance:
- Progressive disclosure + authoring principles: [`references/skill-design-principles.md`](references/skill-design-principles.md)
- Workflow structure patterns: [`workflows.md`](workflows.md)
- Output templates/patterns: [`output-patterns.md`](output-patterns.md)

## Creation flow (recommended)

1. **Collect trigger examples** (real user phrases that should activate the skill).
2. **Define the I/O contract** (paths only) + required artifacts:
   - What files does the skill read?
   - What files must it write (plans, evidence, summaries)?
3. **Implement reusable resources first**:
   - add `scripts/` for deterministic steps
   - add `references/` for heavy documentation
   - add `assets/` for templates / boilerplate
4. **Write `SKILL.md` last**:
   - frontmatter `description` should include trigger phrases
   - body should be short and link out to the resources above
5. **Validate + package** (optional) using the scripts below.

## Scripts

All scripts live in `scripts/` in this skill folder.

### Initialize a new skill folder

```bash
python scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

### Validate a skill (frontmatter + basic conventions)

```bash
python scripts/quick_validate.py /path/to/<skill-name>
```

### Sync catalogs/assets (manifest, skills-map, docs catalog)

```bash
python scripts/sync_catalog.py
```

### Lint skills (compat + quality gates)

```bash
python scripts/skill_lint.py --check-generated
```

### Package a skill into a distributable `.skill` zip (optional)

```bash
python scripts/package_skill.py /path/to/<skill-name> [output-directory]
```

## Notes for Ship Faster contributors

- Prefer prefix naming: `workflow-`, `tool-`, `review-`, `mcp-`, `skill-`, `publish-`.
- Keep side effects gated: write a plan first, ask for explicit confirmation, then execute, then verify.
- If you add/remove a skill, update the catalog: `skills/manifest.json`.

## Claude Code: Slash Commands merged into Skills

Claude Code now treats custom slash commands and skills as the same concept:

- `.claude/commands/<name>.md` and `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` both create `/<name>`
- Existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working (no migration required)
- Prefer creating **skills** going forward so you can bundle `references/`, `scripts/`, and use subagents

Useful frontmatter knobs (Claude Code):

- `disable-model-invocation: true` - only user can invoke (good for side-effect workflows)
- `user-invocable: false` - hide from users; Claude-only background knowledge
- `context: fork` + `agent: Explore|Plan|...` - run skill in a subagent (good for research)
- `allowed-tools` - restrict tool surface when this skill is active
