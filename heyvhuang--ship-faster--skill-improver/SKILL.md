description: Improve skills and workflows by analyzing run artifacts and execution logs (events.jsonl/state.json) under runs/ (or OpenSpec changes/). Use when you want to iterate on skills based on real runs: find failure modes, bottlenecks, unclear prompts, missing I/O contracts, and propose concrete edits. Use when this capability is needed.

# Skill Improver

Retrospect and improve Skills/Workflows based on real execution artifacts, making the skill chain more stable with use.

## Input (pass path only)

- `run_dir`: `runs/<workflow>/active/<run_id>/` (or `openspec/changes/<change-id>/`)

## Output

- `improvements.md`: Improvement suggestions (can be directly converted to change tasks)
- Optional: Minimal patch to relevant `SKILL.md` (only change what's necessary)

## Process

1. Read `logs/state.json` and `logs/events.jsonl`, extract:
   - Failure points (error types, frequency, missing context)
   - Time bottlenecks (repetitive steps, ineffective searches, excessive context)
   - Manual confirmation points (whether too early/too late/missing)
2. Check artifact contracts:
   - Whether each step has persisted output
   - Whether only paths are passed instead of content
   - Whether there are inconsistent naming/paths
3. Output improvement suggestions (sorted by benefit):
   - Prompt/trigger word optimization
   - I/O contract completion (add required fields, fix artifact file names)
   - Error handling and rejection strategies
   - Suggest new deterministic scripts (only when necessary)

## Output Template (recommended)

- Overview: Core issues from this run
- Top Issues (high → low): Each includes "symptom/root cause/fix suggestion/related skill/suggested change point"
- Suggested Minimal Change List: Listed by file
