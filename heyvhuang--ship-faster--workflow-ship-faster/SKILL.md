# Workflow: Ship Faster (Next.js 16.1.1)

The goal of this chain is: **Ship an idea or small prototype to production-ready state in the shortest time**, while maintaining iteration speed afterward.

## When to use

Use this workflow when the user wants an end-to-end chain like:
- “ship this MVP”, “make it production-ready”, “launch/deploy this project”
- “take this prototype and turn it into a real app”
- “set up the foundation + UI system + deployment”

## Core principles (non-negotiable)

- **Pass paths only, not content**: agents/sub-agents only pass `..._path`.
- **Files are first-class citizens**: Every step must persist artifacts; failures can be retried; replayable.
- **Confirmation points**: Any "high-risk/high-effort/side-effect" action must write a plan first and wait for confirmation.
- **Plans are checklists**: progress is tracked in `tasks.md` via `- [ ]` → `- [x]` (not in chat).
- **Progressive disclosure**: Only open step files in this skill directory (`foundation.md`, `deploy-vercel.md`, etc.) when needed—avoid loading all details at once.
- **Hooks doctor (required check; non-blocking)**: If running under Claude Code and you want the evolution loop active, run `tool-hooks-doctor` once at the start of the session; if hooks are missing, offer to install project-level hooks (continue either way).

## Inputs / outputs (paths only)

Inputs (paths only):
- `repo_root`: project root (default `"."`)
- Optional: `run_dir` (active run directory) if the user already has one

Outputs (artifacts, written under `run_dir/`):
- Required: `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `context.json`
- Optional: `design.md`, `evidence/`, `logs/`

Canonical contract (backends, templates, read order, auto-archive):
- [references/artifact-contract.md](references/artifact-contract.md)
- Reference index: [references/README.md](references/README.md)

## Step modules (open only when you hit that step)

- Foundation: [foundation.md](foundation.md)
- Guardrails: [guardrails.md](guardrails.md)
- Trace cleanup: [cleanup-traces.md](cleanup-traces.md)
- Docs baseline: [docs-baseline.md](docs-baseline.md)
- Supabase integration: [supabase-integration.md](supabase-integration.md)
- Stripe integration: [stripe-integration.md](stripe-integration.md)
- Deploy (GitHub + Vercel): [deploy-vercel.md](deploy-vercel.md)
- AI-era SEO (Next.js): [ai-seo-nextjs.md](ai-seo-nextjs.md)

## Process (Default Route)

### 0) Initialize Run (Required)

1. Resolve/create `run_dir/` (see the deterministic backend rules in [references/artifact-contract.md](references/artifact-contract.md)).
2. Ensure core artifacts exist (create if missing; merge/append if already present):
   - `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `context.json`
3. In `tasks.md`, ensure:
   - a `status: active|blocked|done` field near the top
   - a short **Next action** section (1–3 items)
   - an **Approvals** section (empty is fine until needed)
4. Only create `evidence/` and `logs/` when you actually have large outputs to store.

### 0.2) Scope Confirmation (Required)

Problem this solves: a run summary that marks core steps as “skipped” without the user ever choosing to skip them is misleading and hard to audit.

Ask the user to select a scope **before** executing steps beyond build checks:

- **A) full (default)**: Foundation → Design system → UI/UX → Guardrails → Docs → Feature iteration → Deploy
- **B) deploy-only**: Foundation (build + sanity) → Deploy only (no UI work, no guardrails/docs polish)
- **C) design-only**: Design system + UI/UX plan only (no code changes)
- **D) feature-only**: One feature iteration (plan + implementation), skip deploy

Rules:
- Persist the chosen scope to `context.json` (add/update a `scope` field).
- In `tasks.md`, do **not** mark a default step as “skipped” unless the user explicitly requested skipping it.
  - Prefer: `disabled (scope=...)` with a short reason under a “Scope / Disabled steps” section
- Any destructive action (e.g., **force push** overwriting an existing repo) is a high-risk side effect:
  - Write an executable approval item under `tasks.md` first
  - Wait for explicit user confirmation before executing

### 0.25) Kickoff Clarification (Brainstorm-lite) (Recommended; required if goal is vague)

Problem this solves: people jump straight into “implement a feature” and end up with a very basic MVP that’s hard to demo.

Run this step if **any** of these are true:
- `proposal.md` is missing clear **acceptance criteria** and **non-goals**
- The user request is “build something like X” / “make a prototype” without specifying the core loop
- The user explicitly wants a “demo-ready” prototype (animation, wow factor, shareable)

How:
- Call `workflow-brainstorm` using the **same `repo_root` + this `run_dir`**.
- Follow the one-question-at-a-time rule and converge on:
  - the one core loop (1 sentence)
  - acceptance criteria (3–5 bullets)
  - non-goals (1–3 bullets)
  - constraints (timeline / risk preference)
  - a “demo moment” direction (see step 0.3)
- Persist the confirmed spec to:
  - `evidence/YYYY-MM-DD-kickoff-design.md`
- Then update (merge, don’t overwrite) these inputs:
  - `proposal.md`
  - `context.json` (ensure `need_database/need_billing/need_deploy/need_seo` are explicitly set)

### 0.3) Demo Moment First (Recommended for prototypes)

Principle: a prototype that **feels real** needs at least one “demo moment” (tastefully showy, not gimmicky).

Examples of “demo moment” (pick 1, keep it small):
- A hero section with a **live interactive preview** (fake data is fine) + smooth, purposeful motion
- A delightful micro-interaction: command palette, draggable cards, timeline scrubber, etc.
- A “before/after” transformation animation (input → output) that makes the core loop obvious

Workflow:
1. Write a small feature spec file (if it doesn’t exist):
   - `evidence/feature-00-demo-moment.md`
   - Include `mode: plan-only`, `feature_slug: demo-moment`, and `quality_bar: demo-ready`
2. Call `workflow-feature-shipper` to generate the plan **only** (no implementation yet).
3. Defer actual UI implementation until after Step 2 (design-system.md exists), so the demo moment follows the chosen design system.

### 0.5) Dynamic Branch Decision (Required)

Dynamically adjust execution order based on `context.json` content:

- **Database integration**: Only execute when `context.json` has `"need_database": true`
- **Payment integration**: Only execute when `context.json` has `"need_billing": true` or `"need_stripe": true`
- **Auth**: Only execute when `context.json` has `"need_auth": true` or `"auth": true`
- **Deployment**: Only execute when `context.json` has `"need_deploy": true` or user explicitly requests deployment
- **SEO**: Only execute when `context.json` has `"need_seo": true` or project is already live

Before starting each optional step:
- Check `context.json` (and your chosen `scope`) to decide whether the step applies
- If skipped, write a 1-line reason into `tasks.md` (so resume/audit doesn’t require chat history)

### 1) Foundation: Next.js Foundation (Default Required)

Open and follow: [foundation.md](foundation.md).

Artifact requirements (minimum):
- `evidence/foundation.md` (current state + risk assessment + chosen route)
- `tasks.md`: add a **Foundation** checklist section (tasks + verification commands)
- If upgrade/migration needed with significant changes: add an **Approval** item to `tasks.md` and wait for confirmation

**Branch rules (important)**:
- If conclusion is **keep-current-stack** (e.g., Vite static site), don't force continuing "Next.js-specific steps".
  - Only continue steps that still apply to current stack: style (2), guardrails (3, adapted for current stack), docs (4), deploy (8 optional), SEO (9 optional)
  - If DB/payment integration still needed: First ask user "want to migrate to Next.js?", or add integration step for that stack (not in this chain's default scope)

### 2) Style Specification (Default Required)

Call `tool-design-style-selector`: Scan project intent and persist `design-system.md`.

Confirmation point: After user confirms style, deploy `design-system.md`, and enter **2.5 UI/UX Implementation** (default required; if user explicitly skips, log reason).

### 2.5) UI/UX Implementation (Default Required)

Goal: Make `design-system.md` actually reflected in the interface, not "wrote spec but UI unchanged".

Recommended approach: Treat "redo UI/UX per design-system.md" as an independent feature and hand to `workflow-feature-shipper`:
- Input: `design-system.md` (as sole design constraint) + current UI page list (from code scan)
- Output: `evidence/features/<feature_slug>-plan.md` (scope/acceptance criteria/non-goals/risks/rollback) + code changes

Default enrichment (when installed):
- If `tool-ui-ux-pro-max` is installed, use it to enrich the UI/UX plan with concrete palette/typography/UX guardrails, and use its pre-delivery checklist as acceptance criteria.
- Only skip `tool-ui-ux-pro-max` enrichment if the user explicitly asks to skip it (e.g., “don’t over-design / keep it simple”), and log the reason.

For large-scale refactoring: add an **Approval** item to `tasks.md` first and wait for user confirmation before implementing.

### 3) Code Standards (Lightweight Required)

Open and follow: [guardrails.md](guardrails.md).

Artifact: `tasks.md` (Guardrails checklist section)

### 3.5) Trace Cleanup (De-branding & Source Hygiene) (Required if project was copied)

Problem this solves: many starter projects imported from Google AI Studio / v0 / Lovable ship with vendor branding, broken remnants (like `importmap`), and misleading README instructions.

Open and follow: [cleanup-traces.md](cleanup-traces.md).

Artifacts:
- `evidence/trace-scan.md`
- `tasks.md` (Trace cleanup checklist section)

### 4) Documentation Standards (Lightweight Required)

Open and follow: [docs-baseline.md](docs-baseline.md).

Artifact: `tasks.md` (Docs checklist section, plus project README update)

### 5) Core Feature Development (Iterative Loop)

Call `workflow-feature-shipper`:
- Each feature first produces `evidence/features/<feature_slug>-plan.md` (with acceptance criteria/non-goals)
- Default split into PR-able small steps
- After each batch (or before merge), recommend calling `review-quality` for a conclusive review + verdict
- `review-quality` is the single entry point and will auto-triage: if React/Next.js performance risk is detected, it will also run `review-react-best-practices` (CRITICAL rules first)

Auth note (optional): if a feature includes login/session/permissions and `tool-better-auth` is installed, call it before implementation to lock down session strategy, redirects, cookies/CSRF, and middleware boundaries. Persist:
- `evidence/auth-plan.md`
- `evidence/auth-summary.md`

### 6) Database Integration (Optional)

**Execution condition**: `context.json` has `"need_database": true` or `"database": "supabase"`

Open and follow: [supabase-integration.md](supabase-integration.md).

### 7) Payment Integration (Optional)

**Execution condition**: `context.json` has `"need_billing": true` or `"need_stripe": true` or `"payment": true`

Open and follow: [stripe-integration.md](stripe-integration.md).

### 8) GitHub + Vercel Deployment (Optional but Recommended)

**Execution condition**: `context.json` has `"need_deploy": true` or `"deploy_target"` field exists and non-empty

Open and follow: [deploy-vercel.md](deploy-vercel.md).

### 9) AI-Era SEO (Optional but Recommended)

**Execution condition**: `context.json` has `"need_seo": true` or `"seo": true`, or step 8 completed successfully (already deployed)

Open and follow: [ai-seo-nextjs.md](ai-seo-nextjs.md).

## Final Delivery

Write to: `final.md` (in the run root), at minimum include:
- Current project status (can run locally, can build, is deployed)
- Completed steps and artifact paths
- Next steps (prioritized by value)

And wrap up:
- Update `tasks.md` `status` to `done`, and fill the **Delivery summary**
- Run auto-archive after each batch (and at the end):
  - `python3 ~/.claude/skills/workflow-ship-faster/scripts/auto_archive.py --run-dir "<run_dir>"`
- If you want a clean workspace (without auto-archive): move `active/<run_id>/` → `archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<run_id>/`
- Do a `skill-evolution` **Evolution checkpoint** (3 questions); if user chooses "want to optimize", run `skill-improver` based on this `run_dir` to produce minimal patch suggestions
