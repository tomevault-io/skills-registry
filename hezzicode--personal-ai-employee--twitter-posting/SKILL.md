# Twitter/X Posting Skill

Generate and post content to Twitter/X with human approval.

## When to Use

Trigger when user requests:
- "Tweet about [topic]"
- "Post on Twitter about [topic]"
- "Create X post about [topic]"
- "Thread about [topic]"

## Process

1. **Read Context**
   - `vault/Business_Goals.md` - Brand voice
   - `vault/Dashboard.md` - Recent activity

2. **Generate Content**
   - Single tweet: 280 chars max
   - Thread: 3-5 connected tweets
   - Hashtags: 2-3 relevant

3. **Save Draft**
   - Location: `vault/Social_Media/Twitter_Drafts/`
   - Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD_[topic].md`

4. **On Approval**
   - Execute via `scripts/twitter_poster.py`
   - Log result in Logs/

## Tweet Guidelines

### Single Tweet
- 200-270 characters ideal
- Hook in first line
- One clear message
- 2-3 hashtags max
- Optional emoji (1-2)

### Thread
- Tweet 1: Hook + premise
- Tweets 2-4: Main points
- Final tweet: CTA + hashtags

## Output Format

```markdown
---
type: twitter_draft
created: [timestamp]
format: single|thread
status: pending
---

# Twitter Draft: [Topic]

## Tweet
[Content here - 280 char max]

## Hashtags

## Safety

- Rate limit: 3 tweets/day max
- No controversial content

## Scripts

Use `scripts/twitter_poster.py` for Playwright automation.
