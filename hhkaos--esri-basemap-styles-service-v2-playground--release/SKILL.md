# Create Release

Create a new versioned release with proper tagging and GitHub Release.

## Step 1: Determine Version

If version provided as argument (`$ARGUMENTS`), use it. Otherwise:

1. Read current version from `package.json` (if exists)
2. Ask user for new version number
3. Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
   - **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes
   - **MINOR** (0.x.0): New features, backward compatible
   - **PATCH** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, backward compatible

Example: `1.2.3` → `1.3.0` for new feature

## Step 2: Update CHANGELOG.md

1. Read CHANGELOG.md
2. Find `## [Unreleased]` section
3. Move all entries from `[Unreleased]` to new version section:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [1.3.0] - 2024-03-15

### Added
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

### Fixed
- Bug fix 1
```

4. Add current date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
5. Leave `[Unreleased]` section empty for future changes

## Step 3: Update package.json (if exists)

If `package.json` exists:

1. Read current version
2. Update to new version:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.3.0"
   }
   ```
3. Save file

## Step 4: Commit Changes

Stage and commit version bump:

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md package.json
git commit -m "chore: release v1.3.0

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

## Step 5: Create Git Tag

Create annotated tag with changelog:

```bash
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release v1.3.0

[Copy the changelog entries for this version here]"
```

## Step 6: Push Changes and Tag

```bash
git push && git push --tags
```

Confirm both succeed before proceeding.

## Step 7: Create GitHub Release

Use `gh` CLI to create GitHub Release:

```bash
gh release create v1.3.0 \
  --title "v1.3.0" \
  --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What's New

[Copy Added section from CHANGELOG]

## Bug Fixes

[Copy Fixed section from CHANGELOG]

## Changes

[Copy Changed section from CHANGELOG]

---

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/compare/v1.2.3...v1.3.0
EOF
)"
```

Options to consider:
- `--draft` - Create as draft for review
- `--prerelease` - Mark as pre-release (for beta, rc, etc.)
- `--latest` - Mark as latest release (default)

## Step 8: Verify Release

1. Check GitHub Releases page
2. Verify tag exists: `git tag -l`
3. Confirm CHANGELOG.md updated correctly
4. Confirm package.json version updated

## Summary

Report to user:
- Version released: v1.3.0
- Changelog updated ✓
- Git tag created ✓
- GitHub Release published ✓
- Link to release: [URL]

## Next Steps

Suggest to user:
- Announce the release
- Update documentation if needed
- Deploy to production if applicable

## Error Handling

- **No unreleased changes**: Warn user, ask if they want to proceed anyway
- **Git push fails**: Report error, may need to pull first
- **Tag already exists**: Error, ask user to choose different version
- **gh CLI not available**: Provide manual instructions for creating release
- **Permission denied**: User may need to authenticate with `gh auth login`

## Version Naming Conventions

- Release: `v1.2.3`
- Pre-release: `v1.2.3-beta.1`, `v1.2.3-rc.2`
- Major versions: `v1.0.0`, `v2.0.0`

Always prefix with `v` for git tags.
