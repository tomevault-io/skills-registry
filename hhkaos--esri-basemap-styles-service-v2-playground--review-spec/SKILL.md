# Review Specification

Conduct an in-depth review of the project specification with detailed Q&A.

## Step 1: Read Current Specification

1. Read `docs/SPEC.md`
2. Analyze completeness of each section
3. Identify areas needing clarification

## Step 2: Technical Implementation Questions

Ask detailed questions about:

### Architecture & Design
- What architectural pattern will you use? (MVC, microservices, serverless, etc.)
- How will components communicate?
- What's your state management strategy?
- How will you handle data persistence?
- What's your caching strategy?
- How will you scale the application?

### Tech Stack Details
- Why did you choose [framework/library X] over alternatives?
- What version constraints do you have?
- Are there any legacy systems to integrate with?
- What are the browser/platform support requirements?

### Data Models
- What are the core entities and their relationships?
- What fields are required vs. optional?
- How will you handle data validation?
- What's your database schema?
- How will you handle migrations?

### API Design
- RESTful, GraphQL, or RPC?
- What authentication/authorization mechanism?
- Rate limiting requirements?
- Versioning strategy?
- Error handling conventions?

### Security
- What are the main security threats?
- How will you handle authentication? (JWT, sessions, OAuth, etc.)
- What data needs encryption at rest vs. in transit?
- How will you prevent common vulnerabilities? (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.)
- What's your secret management strategy?

## Step 3: UI/UX Questions

### User Experience
- Who are the primary user personas?
- What are the critical user journeys?
- What devices/screen sizes must be supported?
- Any accessibility requirements? (WCAG level, screen readers, etc.)
- How should the app handle errors and edge cases?
- What loading states and feedback mechanisms?

### Design System
- Will you use an existing design system or create custom?
- What's the visual style? (modern, minimal, playful, etc.)
- Color palette and branding guidelines?
- Typography choices?
- Animation and interaction patterns?

### Information Architecture
- How will navigation work?
- What information hierarchy?
- How will users discover features?
- What onboarding experience?

## Step 4: Concerns & Constraints

Ask about:

### Technical Concerns
- What are the main technical risks?
- Any performance requirements? (load time, response time, etc.)
- Offline functionality needed?
- What's the expected data volume?
- Concurrency and race condition handling?

### Business Constraints
- What's the deadline/timeline?
- Budget constraints affecting tech choices?
- Team size and skill levels?
- Maintenance and support plan?

### Operational Concerns
- Monitoring and observability strategy?
- Logging approach?
- Backup and disaster recovery?
- Deployment process?
- How to handle rollbacks?

## Step 5: Tradeoffs & Alternatives

For major decisions, explore:

### Each Technical Decision
- What alternatives did you consider?
- Why this choice over others?
- What are you optimizing for? (speed, cost, maintainability, etc.)
- What are the tradeoffs?
- Under what conditions might you reconsider?

### Example Tradeoff Discussion
```
Decision: Use [Technology X]
Alternatives considered: [Y, Z]
Chosen because: [reasons]
Tradeoffs:
  - Pros: [benefits]
  - Cons: [drawbacks]
Would reconsider if: [conditions]
```

## Step 6: Potential Improvements

Suggest improvements based on:
- Industry best practices
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Scalability considerations
- Maintainability concerns
- Security enhancements
- User experience optimizations

Ask:
- "Have you considered [alternative approach]?"
- "What about [edge case]?"
- "How will you handle [scaling concern]?"

## Step 7: Update docs/SPEC.md

For each answer received:

1. Update the appropriate section in docs/SPEC.md
2. Add new sections if needed
3. Fill in "Open Questions" with answers
4. Document decisions in "Trade-offs & Decisions"
5. Update implementation plan with new details
6. Add any identified risks to "Risks & Mitigations"

## Step 8: Review Completeness

After updates, verify docs/SPEC.md has:
- [ ] Clear problem statement
- [ ] Detailed solution description
- [ ] Well-defined user stories
- [ ] Complete technical design
- [ ] Data models documented
- [ ] API endpoints specified
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] UI/UX design principles
- [ ] Implementation plan with phases
- [ ] All major decisions documented
- [ ] Risks identified and mitigated
- [ ] Success metrics defined

## Step 9: Summary

Provide user with:
- Summary of changes made to docs/SPEC.md
- Remaining open questions (if any)
- Suggested next steps
- Potential risks to be aware of

## Asking Strategy

- Ask 3-5 questions at a time (don't overwhelm)
- Group related questions together
- Provide context for why you're asking
- Offer multiple choice options when helpful
- Follow up on vague answers for specifics

## Output Quality

Ensure docs/SPEC.md updates are:
- Specific and actionable
- Well-organized
- Easy to read
- Include examples where helpful
- Link to external resources when relevant

## Last message for the user

Ask if they want you to work on phased plan (PLAN.md) for implementation based on the reviewed specification.
