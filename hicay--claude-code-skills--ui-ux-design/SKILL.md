# UI/UX Design — The Dieter Rams Method

Design interfaces that are functional, honest, unobtrusive, and thorough down to the last detail. North star: **"Weniger, aber besser"** — less, but better.

## Before Designing

Read any existing design system, tokens, or style guides in the codebase first. Never introduce a second design language.

Gather context (ask if not provided):

1. **What exists** — current state, design system, platform, framework
2. **Purpose** — screen's single most important job, primary action
3. **Constraints** — features to preserve, platform conventions, accessibility
4. **Context** — how this screen relates to the app, user flow, user mental model

## The 10 Principles Applied to Digital Design

### 1. Innovative
Question every convention before adopting it. Solve the actual problem, not the perceived pattern.

### 2. Useful
Every element must earn its place. If removing it doesn't reduce functionality, remove it. If a label exists elsewhere (sidebar, tab bar), don't repeat it as page title.

### 3. Aesthetic
Beauty from proportion, alignment, restraint — not decoration. A mathematical grid is more beautiful than any gradient. Whitespace is a design element.

### 4. Understandable
Information architecture > visual styling. Group related items. Use progressive disclosure. If you need a tooltip, the design has failed.

### 5. Unobtrusive
Content speaks, chrome whispers. Actions on hover (unless high-frequency). Borders over shadows. Controls area (sidebar) is muted; content area is bright.

### 6. Honest
No fake depth, no skeuomorphism unless it serves comprehension. Feedback is factual (checkmark, not confetti). Disabled = clearly muted.

### 7. Long-Lasting
Monochrome + one accent ages well. System fonts at considered sizes outlast custom typefaces. Avoid trends (glassmorphism, neumorphism).

### 8. Thorough
Nothing arbitrary. Spacing from the grid. Color from the palette. Typography from the scale. Transitions from the timing tokens. Every state designed: empty, loading, error, hover, active, disabled.

### 9. Environmentally Friendly
Fewer views, simpler rendering. Solid colors over gradients. System fonts over custom fonts. Fewer choices per screen = less cognitive load.

### 10. As Little Design as Possible
If in doubt, remove. One accent color > five. Thin divider > card wrapper. Content flowing naturally > content in containers.

## Design System Foundation

For complete token specifications, see [references/design-tokens.md](references/design-tokens.md).

### Key Principles

**Grid**: All spacing derives from a single base unit (8pt). Never use arbitrary pixel values.

**Color**: Achromatic palette + one functional accent. Three text tiers max (primary, secondary, tertiary). Accent reserved for critical states only.

**Typography**: System font, considered sizes. Section headers: UPPERCASE + tracked. Body: consistent size. Monospaced only for numbers/code.

**Shape**: Continuous corners, never circular for containers. Three radius sizes (small, medium, large).

**Motion**: Always easeInOut. Never spring, bouncy, or linear. Animation communicates state, never entertains.

## Layout Patterns

### Two-Tone Layout (The Braun Pattern)

Control panel is quiet, content area is the focus. Like a Braun SK 4 or RT 20.

```
+----------+---------------------------------+
| SIDEBAR  |         CONTENT AREA            |
| (grey)   |         (white)                 |
| recessed |         bright surface          |
| navigate |         focus here              |
+----------+---------------------------------+
```

- Sidebar: recessed/muted surface
- Content: primary surface, full contrast
- Separation: thin border line or inset content (display-in-chassis effect)

### Section Grouping

Label sits outside, content grouped on a subtle panel.

```
SECTION TITLE              <- uppercase, tracked, tertiary text
+------------------------------+
|  icon  Row title      value  |   <- surface panel with border
|  - - - - - - - - - - - - -  |   <- subtle divider (indented past icon)
|  icon  Row title      value  |
+------------------------------+
```

### Content Flow (No Cards)

For lists, don't wrap each item in a card. Content flows with thin dividers.

```
Content text flowing naturally...
Jan 15, 2025

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    <- thin divider (not after last item)

Another content item...
Jan 14, 2025
```

### Action Visibility Hierarchy

| Level | When | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Always visible | High-frequency, primary | Copy button as margin marker |
| On hover | Secondary | Edit, delete, re-process |
| Behind confirmation | Destructive or rare | Delete with dialog |

---

## Component Patterns

For complete component library with code examples, see [references/component-library.md](references/component-library.md).

### Row Anatomy

```
+-----------------------------------------------+
| [icon 14pt]  Title 13pt         [accessory]   |
|              Subtitle 11pt                    |
+-----------------------------------------------+
```

- Icon: 14pt, secondary color, 20px frame (landmark for scanning)
- Title: 13pt regular, primary color
- Subtitle: 11pt regular, tertiary color
- Padding: horizontal 2 units, vertical 1.75 units
- Accessory: right-aligned (toggle, chevron, value, button)

### Key Variants

- **Navigation Row**: + chevron.right + optional detail text + hover background
- **Toggle Row**: + scaled toggle (0.8) at trailing edge
- **Selection Row (Radio)**: filled/empty 8px circle + title weight changes on select
- **Action Row**: hover-to-reveal icon buttons (edit, delete)

### Other Components

- **Status Line**: instruction left + compact stats right, in bordered container
- **Buttons**: plain style always, black fill for primary, no system chrome
- **Menu/Dropdown**: inline value + chevron, no border on trigger
- **Search**: icon + plain text field in bordered container
- **Empty State**: just text, no illustrations, no emoji

## Information Architecture — 5 Questions

Before styling, answer these:

1. **What is the single most important thing on this screen?** Everything else subordinate.
2. **What can be removed without losing function?** Titles duplicating nav, decorative icons, obvious labels.
3. **What can be hidden until needed?** Edit controls, secondary actions, advanced options.
4. **What is the natural reading order?** Top-left = identity, top-right = status, center = content, bottom = actions.
5. **How do similar screens in this app work?** Consistency is non-negotiable.

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead |
|---|---|
| Drop shadows for depth | Border + surface hierarchy |
| Card per list item | Content flow + thin dividers |
| Icon badges (colored circles) | Inline monochrome icons |
| Full-width buttons in lists | Compact right-aligned buttons |
| Spring/bouncy animations | easeInOut, purposeful |
| Multiple accent colors | One functional accent |
| Gradient backgrounds | Solid surfaces |
| System button/field styles | Plain styles + custom styling |
| Decorative illustrations in empty states | Honest text only |
| Color-coded status | Monochrome + one accent for critical |
| Page titles duplicating nav | Remove — nav provides context |
| Thick separators | 0.5pt borders, subtle opacity |
| Heavy font weights for emphasis | Position/surface hierarchy |
| Modals for every action | Inline editing, hover actions |
| Arbitrary pixel values | Grid-derived spacing only |

---

## Redesign Process

### Step 1: Read Everything
Read all files involved. Understand every feature, state, edge case. Never redesign what you don't understand.

### Step 2: Map Information Architecture
List every piece of information and action. Categorize: **Essential** (visible immediately), **Important** (visible but secondary), **Available** (on demand), **Removable** (delete it).

### Step 3: Define Hierarchy
Use: position (top-left = most important), size, weight (medium > regular), color (primary > secondary > tertiary), space (more space = more importance).

### Step 4: Apply Existing Patterns
Don't invent new patterns. Reuse: grouped list → SettingsGroup, content list → flow with dividers, status → StatusLine, selection → radio row, actions → hover-to-reveal.

### Step 5: Verify Consistency
Check every other screen. Section headers identical, spacing values match, components reused, typography respected.

### Step 6: Build and Verify
Build after every change. Design doesn't exist until it compiles and renders.

## Review Checklist

For the complete review checklist, see [references/review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md).

Quick check:
- [ ] No arbitrary spacing — everything from grid
- [ ] Max 3 text colors (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- [ ] Section headers consistent across ALL screens
- [ ] Actions hidden until hover (except high-frequency)
- [ ] No system button/field chrome
- [ ] Same patterns for same purposes everywhere

---

## Platform Notes

**macOS**: Hover states essential (replace touch feedback). `onHover {}` for interactivity. Minimal window chrome.

**iOS**: No hover — actions visible or behind swipe/tap. Tab bar replaces sidebar. Touch targets min 44pt.

**Web**: Hover + click. CSS custom properties for tokens. `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility.

**Cross-platform**: Keep information architecture identical. Adapt interaction model (hover vs. tap), not hierarchy.

## Braun Reference

| Product | Design Lesson |
|---|---|
| **SK 4** (player) | Control panel quiet, content area is focus |
| **RT 20** (radio) | Two-tone: each zone has one function |
| **ET 66** (calculator) | Display inset into chassis, perfect grid |
| **T 1000** (radio) | Information density through hierarchy, not decoration |
| **ABW 21** (clock) | Nothing to remove — pure function as form |
