name: similar-code
description: Find semantically similar code across the codebase using vector search (armyknife searchx). Use when looking for similar implementations, duplicate code, or existing patterns. Requires symbols.db. Use when this capability is needed.

  author: hippocampus-dev

* Always use actual code as query input, not natural language descriptions
* Prerequisite: `symbols.db` must exist at project root (built via `armyknife searchx index`)

## Workflow

1. User provides code as argument (e.g., `/similar-code <pasted code>`)
2. Run the search command:

```bash
armyknife searchx query '<code>' --limit 10 --database symbols.db
```

3. Present results as a table (symbol, kind, file, line, similarity)
4. Read top matches to show code context

## Interpreting Results

| Similarity | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 0.8+ | Very similar (likely same pattern or implementation) |
| 0.6-0.8 | Related (similar structure or purpose) |
| <0.6 | Weak match |

## Limitations

| Input Type | Result Quality |
|------------|----------------|
| Actual code | Good (designed for code-to-code similarity) |
| Natural language | Poor (embedding model is code-focused) |

Code is embedded using `embeddinggemma:300m` (768-dim) via Ollama.
