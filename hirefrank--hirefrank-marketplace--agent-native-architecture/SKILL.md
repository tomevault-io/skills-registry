## The Prompt-Native Philosophy for Cloudflare Edge

Agent native engineering inverts traditional software architecture. Instead of writing code that the agent executes, you define outcomes in prompts and let the agent figure out HOW to achieve them using Cloudflare's edge primitives.

### The Foundational Principle

**Whatever the user can do, the agent can do. Many things the developer can do, the agent can do.**

Don't artificially limit the agent. If a user could read state, write to Durable Objects, queue messages, call Workers—the agent should be able to do those things too. The agent figures out HOW to achieve an outcome; it doesn't just call your pre-written functions.

### Features Are Prompts

Each feature is a prompt that defines an outcome and gives the agent the tools it needs. The agent then figures out how to accomplish it.

**Traditional:** Feature = Worker function that agent calls
**Prompt-native:** Feature = prompt defining desired outcome + primitive Cloudflare tools

The agent doesn't execute your code. It uses Cloudflare primitives to achieve outcomes you describe.

### Tools Provide Capability, Not Behavior

Tools should be primitives that enable capability. The prompt defines what to do with that capability.

**Wrong:** `process_workflow(data, steps, handlers)` — agent executes your workflow
**Right:** `durable_object_rpc`, `queue_send`, `kv_put`, `service_binding_call` — agent figures out the flow

Pure primitives are better, but domain primitives (like `store_agent_state`) are OK if they don't encode logic—just storage/retrieval.

### The Development Lifecycle

1. **Start in the prompt** - New features begin as natural language defining outcomes
2. **Iterate rapidly** - Change behavior by editing prose, not refactoring Workers code
3. **Graduate when stable** - Harden to Workers code when requirements stabilize AND speed/reliability matter
4. **Many features stay as prompts** - Not everything needs to become a Worker

### Cloudflare Edge Architecture for Agents

The edge is ideal for agent-native systems:

**Durable Objects = Agent State**
- Each agent instance gets a Durable Object
- State persists between events
- Built-in coordination and consistency

**Workers = Event Handlers**
- Lightweight, event-driven execution
- Agent responds to HTTP, Queue, Cron events
- Fast cold starts enable on-demand agent activation

**Queues = Agent Messaging**
- Agents communicate via message passing
- Async workflows without blocking
- Guaranteed delivery and retry

**Service Bindings = Agent Collaboration**
- Zero-latency RPC between agents
- Type-safe inter-agent communication
- Compose multi-agent systems

### Self-Modification (Advanced)

The advanced tier: agents that can evolve their own code, prompts, and behavior. On Cloudflare, this means:

- Approval gates for Worker code changes
- Git commit before modifications (rollback capability)
- Health checks via Logpush/Analytics
- Deploy verification before cutover
- Version-controlled Durable Object migrations

### Context Management Strategies

Long-running agents face a fundamental challenge: context grows unbounded. Two key patterns from production systems:

**Agentic Search Over Semantic Search**

When retrieving information, prioritize accuracy over speed. Let the agent search iteratively rather than relying on semantic similarity alone.

- **Semantic search**: Fast but can miss relevant context due to embedding limitations
- **Agentic search**: Agent formulates queries, evaluates results, refines search—slower but more accurate
- **On the edge**: Use Workers KV for semantic embeddings, but let agent validate and search DO storage directly

The agent decides WHAT is relevant, not your embedding model.

**Context Compaction Strategies**

As agent context grows, implement tiered memory:

1. **Hot context** (in prompt): Current task, immediate state
2. **Warm context** (Durable Object storage): Recent history, working memory
3. **Cold context** (KV/R2): Long-term memory, archived decisions

The agent decides when to compact: "Summarize your last 100 interactions and store the summary. Keep only the summary and last 10 interactions in working memory."

### Verification Pattern Hierarchy

When agents make changes—deploying Workers, modifying state, updating configurations—verification is critical. Use this hierarchy (from most to least preferred):

**1. Rules-Based Verification (PREFERRED)**

Deterministic checks with clear pass/fail criteria. Fast, cheap, reliable.

- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint/Biome linting
- Wrangler validation (`wrangler deploy --dry-run`)
- JSON schema validation
- API contract testing

**2. Visual Verification**

For UI changes or layout-sensitive modifications. The agent takes screenshots and compares.

- Screenshot comparison for Tanstack Start components
- Responsive design verification across breakpoints
- Visual regression testing
- Cloudflare Browser Rendering for headless verification

**3. LLM-as-Judge (LAST RESORT)**

Only when criteria are subjective or fuzzy. Expensive, high latency, non-deterministic.

- Code readability assessment
- Documentation quality
- Natural language output correctness
- Tone/style consistency

The hierarchy is deliberate: prefer determinism. Let rules catch what they can, visual verification for what must be seen, LLM-as-judge only when nothing else works.

**On Cloudflare**: Rules-based verification runs in Workers (milliseconds), visual verification uses Browser Rendering (seconds), LLM-as-judge uses external API calls (seconds + cost).

### When to Use Subagents

Subagents reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. Use them when:

**Parallel Execution Needed**

Multiple independent tasks can run simultaneously.

```typescript
// Orchestrator agent spawns specialized subagents
const [analysis, generation, review] = await Promise.all([
  env.ANALYZER.analyze(data),      // Subagent
  env.GENERATOR.generate(prompt),   // Subagent
  env.REVIEWER.review(content),     // Subagent
]);
```

Each subagent maintains only the context it needs—no shared memory bloat.

**Memory Optimization**

Main agent context is growing too large. Offload specialized tasks:

- **Main agent**: High-level orchestration, 10KB context
- **Data subagent**: Process large datasets, isolated context
- **Writer subagent**: Generate content, no access to orchestration history

On Cloudflare: Each subagent gets its own Durable Object. Service Bindings enable zero-latency RPC between them.

**Isolation Boundaries**

When tasks should NOT share context (security, separation of concerns):

- User-facing agent shouldn't see internal admin operations
- Different tenants get isolated subagents
- Sensitive operations run in dedicated subagents with restricted tools

**Anti-pattern**: Don't create subagents for sequential steps. That's just overhead. Use subagents when parallelism or isolation provides real value.

### When NOT to Use This Approach

- **High-frequency operations** - millions of requests per second per agent
- **Deterministic requirements** - exact same output every time
- **Cost-sensitive scenarios** - when API costs would be prohibitive vs CPU
- **Cold start sensitive** - though Cloudflare Workers are very fast

## Cloudflare-Specific Patterns

### Event-Driven Agent with Workers

```typescript
// Worker receives events, agent processes them
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const event = await request.json();

    // Get agent's Durable Object
    const agentId = env.AGENT_STATE.idFromName(event.agentId);
    const agent = env.AGENT_STATE.get(agentId);

    // Agent processes event
    return agent.fetch(request);
  },

  async queue(batch: MessageBatch, env: Env): Promise<void> {
    for (const message of batch.messages) {
      // Agent responds to queued events
      await processAgentEvent(message.body, env);
    }
  }
};
```

### Agent State with Durable Objects

```typescript
// Agent state persists in Durable Object
export class AgentState extends DurableObject {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    const event = await request.json();

    // Load state
    const state = await this.ctx.storage.get('agentState') || {};

    // Agent decides what to do via prompt
    const result = await runAgent({
      systemPrompt: `You are a stateful agent. Your current state: ${JSON.stringify(state)}
                     Process the event and decide what to store.`,
      event,
      tools: [
        tool("update_state", { key: z.string(), value: z.any() }),
        tool("get_state", { key: z.string() }),
      ]
    });

    // State changes committed atomically
    await this.ctx.storage.put('agentState', result.newState);

    return Response.json(result);
  }
}
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration via Service Bindings

```typescript
// Agents call each other via RPC
export class OrchestratorAgent extends DurableObject {
  async processTask(task: Task): Promise<Result> {
    // Agent decides which specialized agent to call
    const agentDecision = await runAgent({
      systemPrompt: `You coordinate specialized agents via service bindings.
                     Available: ANALYZER_AGENT, WRITER_AGENT, REVIEWER_AGENT.
                     Decide which to call and what to send them.`,
      task,
    });

    // Call specialized agent via binding
    const result = await this.env.ANALYZER_AGENT.analyze(
      agentDecision.data
    );

    return result;
  }
}
```

### Queue-Based Agent Workflows

```typescript
// Agents communicate asynchronously via Queues
async function agentSendMessage(env: Env, recipientId: string, message: any) {
  await env.AGENT_QUEUE.send({
    recipientId,
    message,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  });
}

// Queue consumer activates receiving agent
export default {
  async queue(batch: MessageBatch<AgentMessage>, env: Env) {
    for (const msg of batch.messages) {
      const agentId = env.AGENT_STATE.idFromName(msg.body.recipientId);
      const agent = env.AGENT_STATE.get(agentId);
      await agent.handleMessage(msg.body.message);
    }
  }
};
```
</cloudflare_patterns>

<intake>
What aspect of agent-native architecture on Cloudflare do you need help with?

1. **Design edge architecture** - Plan a Workers + Durable Objects agent system
2. **Create primitive tools** - Build Cloudflare-native tools following the philosophy
3. **Write system prompts** - Define agent behavior for edge execution
4. **Multi-agent systems** - Design agent collaboration via Queues/Bindings
5. **Self-modification** - Enable agents to safely evolve Workers code
6. **Review/refactor** - Make existing Cloudflare code more prompt-native

**Wait for response before proceeding.**
</intake>

<quick_start>
## Build a Cloudflare Prompt-Native Agent

**Step 1: Define Cloudflare primitive tools**
```typescript
const tools = [
  tool("durable_object_get", "Read from Durable Object storage",
    { key: z.string() }),
  tool("durable_object_put", "Write to Durable Object storage",
    { key: z.string(), value: z.any() }),
  tool("queue_send", "Send message to Queue",
    { queue: z.string(), message: z.any() }),
  tool("kv_get", "Read from KV",
    { key: z.string() }),
  tool("service_call", "Call another Worker via binding",
    { service: z.string(), method: z.string(), data: z.any() }),
];
```

**Step 2: Write behavior in the system prompt**
```markdown
## Your Responsibilities
You are an agent running on Cloudflare's edge. When processing events:

1. Load your state from Durable Object storage
2. Analyze what actions are needed
3. Update state, send messages, or call other agents
4. Use your judgment about coordination patterns

Available tools:
- Durable Object storage for your state
- Queues for async messaging to other agents
- Service bindings for RPC to specialized agents
- KV for shared read-heavy data

You decide the workflow. Make it efficient.
```

**Step 3: Deploy as Durable Object + Worker**
```typescript
export class Agent extends DurableObject {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    const event = await request.json();

    const result = await query({
      prompt: JSON.stringify(event),
      options: {
        systemPrompt,
        tools,
      }
    });

    return Response.json(result);
  }
}

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const agentId = env.AGENT.idFromName("agent-1");
    const agent = env.AGENT.get(agentId);
    return agent.fetch(request);
  }
};
```
</quick_start>

## What NOT to Do on Cloudflare

**THE CARDINAL SIN: Agent executes your Worker code instead of figuring things out**

```typescript
// WRONG - You wrote the workflow, agent just executes it
tool("process_order", async ({ order }) => {
  const validated = await validateOrder(order);     // Your code
  const inventory = await checkInventory(order);    // Your code
  const charge = await processPayment(order);       // Your code
  await env.ORDERS_DO.put(order.id, { validated, charge }); // Your code
  if (charge.amount > 1000) {
    await env.NOTIFICATIONS_QUEUE.send({ type: 'high_value' }); // Your code
  }
});

// RIGHT - Agent figures out how to process orders
tool("durable_object_get", { key }, ...);  // Primitive
tool("durable_object_put", { key, value }, ...);  // Primitive
tool("queue_send", { message }, ...);  // Primitive
tool("service_call", { service, method, data }, ...);  // Primitive
// Prompt says: "Validate order, check inventory via INVENTORY service binding,
// charge payment, store result, notify if > $1000"
```

**Don't fight Cloudflare's execution model**

```typescript
// WRONG - trying to maintain long-running connections in Workers
const connections = new Map(); // This won't work across requests

// RIGHT - use Durable Objects for stateful connections
export class WebSocketAgent extends DurableObject {
  async fetch(request: Request) {
    const pair = new WebSocketPair();
    this.ctx.acceptWebSocket(pair[1]);
    return new Response(null, { status: 101, webSocket: pair[0] });
  }
}
```

**Don't over-complicate agent coordination**

```typescript
// Wrong - complex state synchronization
tool("sync_all_agents", async () => {
  // Complex merge logic across multiple Durable Objects
});

// Right - let agents message each other via Queues
tool("queue_send", { recipientId, message }, ...);
// Agents figure out coordination via prompts
```

**Don't encode environment-specific logic in tools**

```typescript
// Wrong - tool decides based on environment
tool("store_data", { data }, async ({ data }) => {
  if (env.ENVIRONMENT === 'production') {
    await env.PROD_DO.put(key, data);
  } else {
    await env.DEV_DO.put(key, data);
  }
});

// Right - agent chooses based on context in prompt
tool("durable_object_put", { objectName, key, value }, ...);
// System prompt tells agent which DO to use
```
</anti_patterns>

<cloudflare_best_practices>
## Edge-Specific Best Practices

**Durable Objects for Agent State**
- One Durable Object per agent instance
- Use atomic storage transactions for state consistency
- Leverage SQLite storage API for complex queries
- Implement state versioning for rollback capability

**Workers for Event Handling**
- Keep Workers stateless, state goes in Durable Objects
- Use Service Bindings for zero-latency agent RPC
- Implement Circuit Breaker pattern for external calls
- Cache frequently used data in Workers KV

**Queues for Async Coordination**
- Use Queues for agent-to-agent messaging
- Implement idempotency for queue consumers
- Set appropriate retry policies per workflow
- Use Dead Letter Queues for error handling

**Multi-Region Considerations**
- Durable Objects provide global consistency
- Use KV replication for read-heavy shared data
- Consider location hints for latency-sensitive agents
- Design for eventual consistency across regions

**Cost Optimization**
- Batch operations in Durable Objects to reduce billable time
- Use KV for static/shared data to reduce DO reads
- Implement smart caching to minimize external API calls
- Monitor and optimize cold start patterns

**Observability**
- Use Logpush for agent decision logs
- Implement structured logging for agent actions
- Set up Analytics Engine for agent metrics
- Use Tail Workers for real-time debugging
