# Workflow Pattern Analyzer (Web Compatible)

## Instructions

This skill provides comprehensive conversation pattern analysis using Claude's native chat history tools (`recent_chats` and `conversation_search`) to identify skill-worthy automation opportunities with statistical rigor.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Web interface compatible (no exports required)
- Statistical pattern validation and scoring
- Frequency analysis and temporal tracking
- Evidence-based skill recommendations
- Complete skill package generation

**Compatible with:** Claude.ai web interface, Claude Code, API

**How Analysis Works:**
- **No scripts or Python files**: This is a pure prompt-based analysis using Claude's native capabilities
- **Full content analysis**: Examines complete conversation content, messages, and patterns (not just titles or names)
- **Thread names**: Renaming conversations has minimal impact - analysis focuses on actual message content and patterns
- **Domain discovery**: Categories emerge from your actual usage data, not forced into predefined buckets
- **Data-driven approach**: Identifies YOUR specific patterns (recipes, image prompting, game design, etc.) rather than assuming business/coding focus

## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Data Collection Strategy

**Determine Analysis Scope:**

Ask user: "How deep should I analyze your conversation history?"

**Options:**
- **Quick Scan** (20-30 conversations, ~2-3 min): Recent patterns and immediate opportunities
- **Standard Analysis** (50-75 conversations, ~5-7 min): Comprehensive pattern detection
- **Deep Dive** (100+ conversations, ~10-15 min): Full workflow mapping with temporal trends
- **Targeted Search** (variable): Focus on specific topics or time periods

**Data Collection Process:**

1. **Broad Sampling**: Use `recent_chats(n=30)` multiple times with varied parameters to get diverse coverage
2. **Temporal Distribution**: Sample conversations across different time periods (recent, 1 week ago, 1 month ago)
3. **Topic Exploration**: Use `conversation_search` for domains mentioned by user or detected in initial sampling
4. **Depth vs Breadth**: Balance comprehensive coverage with processing efficiency

### Phase 2: Pattern Discovery & Classification

**Extract patterns using these detection methods:**

#### A. Explicit Pattern Markers
- **Repeated phrasing**: "format this as...", "make it more...", "apply X style"
- **Consistent request structures**: "create a [X] that does [Y]"
- **Recurring formatting instructions**: tables, bullet lists, specific structures
- **Tone/voice adjustments**: "more casual", "add enthusiasm", "formal version"

#### B. Implicit Workflow Patterns
- **Multi-turn conversation structures**: Same workflow across different topics
- **Iterative refinement sequences**: Request → feedback → revision cycles
- **Context re-explanation**: Same background info provided repeatedly
- **Problem-solving approaches**: Consistent debugging/analysis methodologies

#### C. Domain Discovery (Data-Driven)
- **Let domains emerge from the data** - Do NOT pre-categorize into standard domains
- **Topic frequency analysis**: Extract actual subject matter from conversations
  - Examples of specialized domains: recipe transcription, cannabis strains, image prompting, game design, book summaries
  - Examples of traditional domains: coding, business strategy, creative writing, data analysis, technical writing
- **Task type patterns**: Identify the action types that appear (creation, transformation, analysis, troubleshooting, curation, etc.)
- **Niche specialization detection**: Look specifically for narrow, specialized topics with high engagement
- **Cross-domain workflows**: Patterns that span multiple topics
- **Domain diversity scoring**: Reward finding 8-15 distinct domains vs. forcing into 3-4 buckets

**CRITICAL**: Avoid fitting patterns into predefined categories. Each user's conversation history will have unique domains based on their actual usage.

**Terminal Output - Domain Diversity Visualization:**

After completing pattern discovery, display an ASCII chart showing domain distribution:

```

Gaming & Design        █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  1 pattern   (3%)

✅ Domain Diversity: 6 distinct topic areas detected
✅ No predefined categorization - domains emerged from your data
```

This validates data-driven discovery of diverse patterns.

#### D. Niche & Specialized Pattern Detection

**Explicitly search for underrepresented domains:**
- **Hobbyist domains**: Recipes, cocktails, cannabis, gardening, gaming, fitness, travel planning
- **Creative domains**: Story writing, worldbuilding, character development, art direction, music composition
- **Prompt engineering**: Image generation (Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E), video generation, AI art workflows
- **Learning & education**: Book summaries, concept explanations, study guides, teaching materials
- **Personal organization**: Resume writing, cover letters, personal branding, goal setting
- **Entertainment & media**: Game design, narrative design, content creation, video scripts
- **Wellness & lifestyle**: Meal planning, workout routines, meditation guides, habit tracking

**Detection strategy:**
- Look for concentrated clusters of 5+ conversations on the same narrow topic
- Identify specialized vocabulary/jargon (strain names, recipe terms, art styles, game mechanics)
- Find recurring templates/formats specific to that domain
- Don't dismiss low-frequency patterns if they show high consistency and complexity
- Pay special attention to patterns that appear in conversation titles or search results
- Consider that niche patterns may have lower frequency but higher value due to specialization

**Quality indicators for niche patterns:**
- Consistent terminology and domain-specific language
- Recurring output formats or structures
- User demonstrates growing expertise over time
- High engagement (longer conversations, multiple refinements)
- Clear workflow or methodology emerging

#### E. Temporal Patterns
- **Weekly/monthly recurring tasks**: Reports, summaries, check-ins
- **Event-driven patterns**: Meeting prep, post-mortems, launches
- **Seasonal trends**: Quarterly reviews, annual planning
- **Frequency trends**: Increasing/stable/decreasing over time

### Phase 3: Frequency Analysis & Validation

For each identified pattern, calculate:

#### Occurrence Metrics
- **Absolute frequency**: Total instances found in analyzed conversations
- **Relative frequency**: Percentage of conversations containing pattern
- **Temporal distribution**: First occurrence, most recent, clustering
- **Consistency score**: Similarity across pattern instances (0-100%)

#### Statistical Validation
- **Significance threshold**: Pattern must appear in >5% of conversations OR >3 absolute instances
- **Consistency requirement**: 70%+ similarity in requirements/structure across instances
- **Sample size consideration**: Adjust thresholds based on total conversations analyzed

#### Evidence Collection
- Extract 2-4 representative conversation excerpts per pattern
- Note variation types (what changes vs what stays constant)
- Document user refinement patterns (common adjustments made)

### Phase 4: Skill-Worthiness Scoring (0-10 Scale)

**Use extended reasoning to evaluate each pattern across 5 dimensions:**

#### 1. Frequency Score (0-10)
- **10**: Daily usage (20+ instances or >25% of conversations)
- **8-9**: Multiple times per week (10-20 instances or 15-25%)
- **6-7**: Weekly usage (5-9 instances or 8-15%)
- **4-5**: Bi-weekly to monthly (3-4 instances or 5-8%)
- **2-3**: Monthly or less (2 instances or 3-5%)
- **0-1**: One-off or <3% of conversations

#### 2. Consistency Score (0-10)
- **10**: Identical requirements every time (90-100% similarity)
- **8-9**: Highly consistent with minor variations (75-90%)
- **6-7**: Core structure consistent, details vary (60-75%)
- **4-5**: Recognizable pattern, significant variation (45-60%)
- **2-3**: Loosely related, different each time (30-45%)
- **0-1**: No discernible consistency (<30%)

#### 3. Complexity Score (0-10)
- **10**: Multi-step workflow with decision points, high cognitive load
- **8-9**: Complex methodology requiring expertise/frameworks
- **6-7**: Moderate complexity with structured approach
- **4-5**: Straightforward process with some nuance
- **2-3**: Simple task with minimal steps
- **0-1**: Trivial one-step operation

#### 4. Time Savings Score (0-10)
- **10**: >60 min saved per use (or >10 hours/month total)
- **8-9**: 30-60 min per use (or 5-10 hours/month)
- **6-7**: 15-30 min per use (or 2-5 hours/month)
- **4-5**: 5-15 min per use (or 1-2 hours/month)
- **2-3**: 2-5 min per use (or 30-60 min/month)
- **0-1**: <2 min per use (<30 min/month)

#### 5. Error Reduction Score (0-10)
- **10**: Critical tasks with major error consequences
- **8-9**: Common mistakes significantly impact quality
- **6-7**: Regular pitfalls that skill could prevent
- **4-5**: Occasional errors, modest quality improvement
- **2-3**: Minor inconsistencies, small quality gains
- **0-1**: No error patterns, quality already consistent

#### Composite Scoring
- **Total Score**: Sum of 5 dimensions (0-50 scale)
- **Priority Classification**:
  - **Critical** (40-50): Implement immediately
  - **High** (30-39): Strong candidates for skill creation
  - **Medium** (20-29): Consider for skill creation
  - **Low** (10-19): Defer or handle with simple prompts
  - **Not Viable** (0-9): Not worth skill automation

### Phase 5: Relationship Mapping & Consolidation

#### A. Overlap Detection
- Identify shared components across patterns
- Map overlapping functionality (>40% shared steps)
- Find hierarchical relationships (high-level task composed of sub-tasks)
- Detect sequential workflows (tasks that occur in sequence)

#### B. Consolidation Strategies

**Use extended reasoning to determine:**

- **Merge** (>60% overlap): Combine into single comprehensive skill
- **Separate with cross-reference** (30-60% overlap): Distinct skills with links
- **Hierarchical**: Main skill + specialized variants → parent/child structure
- **Modular**: Extract common elements → shared templates/references

#### C. Boundary Optimization

Each skill should have:
- **Clear purpose**: Single, well-defined use case
- **Distinct triggers**: Easy to know when to use vs other skills
- **Minimal overlap**: <30% shared functionality with other skills
- **Appropriate scope**: Not too broad (generic) or narrow (over-specialized)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't recommend skills for:**
- **One-off variations**: Tasks that seem similar but are fundamentally different each time
- **Over-simplified tasks**: Things easier to just ask directly than invoke a skill
- **Better solved by tools**: When external apps/services do it better
- **Insufficient data**: Patterns with <3 instances or <5% frequency (unless strategic)
- **Generic categories**: Broad skills like "help with writing" or "analyze data"

**Red flags in patterns:**
- High frequency but no consistency (chaotic variation)
- High consistency but very low frequency (use a prompt template instead)
- Pattern is declining over time (user may have found better solution)
- Task requires real-time data or external authentication (needs MCP, not skill)

## When to Use This Skill

**✅ Use this skill when:**
- User requests analysis of their conversation patterns
- User wants to identify automation opportunities
- User asks what skills they should create
- User mentions repetitive tasks or workflows
- User wants evidence-based skill recommendations
- User is in web interface (can't use export-based analysis)

**❌ Don't use this skill when:**
- User has conversation export files available (use export-based plugin instead for more comprehensive analysis)
- User wants cross-platform ChatGPT + Claude analysis (requires exports)
- User has very few conversations (<10) making pattern detection unreliable
- User wants to build specific skill they already have in mind
- User is asking about existing skills or community skills

**⚡ Proactive Use:**
When you detect potential patterns during normal conversation, offer:
```
💭 Pattern detected: This is the [Xth] time you've asked me to [action].

Would you like me to analyze your conversation history for similar 
patterns and recommend a Custom Skill? I can identify other automation 
opportunities you might not have noticed.

[Yes, analyze] [Not now]
```

## Progressive Disclosure Strategy

**Keep main analysis concise by organizing information hierarchically:**

1. **Quick overview first**: Summary report with top 3-5 opportunities
2. **Details on demand**: Expand specific patterns when user shows interest
3. **Implementation when ready**: Generate complete skill packages only after user approval
4. **Iterative refinement**: Allow user to adjust scoring weights, focus areas, or analysis depth

**Load additional detail only when:**
- User requests deep dive on specific pattern
- Generating complete skill packages (not just analysis)
- User wants to understand scoring methodology in detail
- Building skills for complex domains requiring extensive examples
