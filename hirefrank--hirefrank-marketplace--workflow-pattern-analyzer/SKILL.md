# Workflow Pattern Analyzer

## Instructions

This skill provides comprehensive conversation pattern analysis using Claude's native chat history tools (`recent_chats` and `conversation_search`) to identify skill-worthy automation opportunities with the statistical rigor of export-based analysis.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Web interface compatible (no exports required)
- Statistical pattern validation and scoring
- Frequency analysis and temporal tracking
- Evidence-based skill recommendations
- Complete skill package generation

## Analysis Framework

This skill uses the **[shared analysis methodology](../../shared/analysis-methodology.md)** with tool-based data collection adaptations.

### Phase 1: Data Collection Strategy

**Determine Analysis Scope:**

Ask user: "How deep should I analyze your conversation history?"

**Options:**
- **Quick Scan** (20-30 conversations, ~2-3 min): Recent patterns and immediate opportunities
- **Standard Analysis** (50-75 conversations, ~5-7 min): Comprehensive pattern detection
- **Deep Dive** (100+ conversations, ~10-15 min): Full workflow mapping with temporal trends
- **Targeted Search** (variable): Focus on specific topics or time periods

**Data Collection Process:**

1. **Broad Sampling**: Use `recent_chats(n=30)` multiple times with varied parameters to get diverse coverage
2. **Temporal Distribution**: Sample conversations across different time periods (recent, 1 week ago, 1 month ago)
3. **Topic Exploration**: Use `conversation_search` for domains mentioned by user or detected in initial sampling
4. **Depth vs Breadth**: Balance comprehensive coverage with processing efficiency

### Phase 2-6: Core Analysis

Apply the **[shared analysis methodology](../../shared/analysis-methodology.md)** phases:

- **Phase 2**: Pattern Discovery & Classification (explicit, implicit, domain, temporal)
- **Phase 3**: Frequency Analysis & Validation (occurrence metrics, statistical validation)
- **Phase 4**: Skill-Worthiness Scoring (0-50 composite scale across 5 dimensions)
- **Phase 5**: Relationship Mapping & Consolidation (overlap detection, boundary optimization)
- **Phase 6**: Prioritization Matrix & Recommendations (frequency vs impact visualization)

See [shared methodology](../../shared/analysis-methodology.md) for complete scoring rubrics and quality standards.

### Phase 7: Skill Package Generation

**For each approved skill, create:**

**A. Skill Specification Document:**

```markdown
## [Skill Name]

**Pattern Evidence:**
- Frequency: [X instances in Y conversations (Z%)]
- Consistency: [X/10 score]
- Time savings: [X hours/month]

**Composite Score: [X/50]**
- Frequency: [X/10]
- Consistency: [X/10]
- Complexity: [X/10]
- Time Savings: [X/10]
- Error Reduction: [X/10]

**Example Conversations:**
1. [Date]: [Brief excerpt showing pattern]

```

## Quality Standards

All quality standards follow the **[shared analysis methodology](../../shared/analysis-methodology.md#quality-standards)**:

- Pattern validation requirements (frequency, consistency, evidence)
- Skill consolidation rules (max 8-12 skills, clear boundaries)
- Skill package generation standards
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## Progressive Disclosure Strategy

**Keep this SKILL.md concise by referencing:**
- **Core methodology**: [shared/analysis-methodology.md](../../shared/analysis-methodology.md)

## When to Use This Skill

**✅ Use this skill when:**
- User requests analysis of their conversation patterns
- User wants to identify automation opportunities
- User asks what skills they should create
- User mentions repetitive tasks or workflows
- User wants evidence-based skill recommendations
- User is in web interface (can't use export-based analysis)

**❌ Don't use this skill when:**
- User has conversation export files available (use export-based plugin instead for more comprehensive analysis)
- User wants cross-platform ChatGPT + Claude analysis (requires exports)
- User has very few conversations (<10) making pattern detection unreliable
- User wants to build specific skill they already have in mind
- User is asking about existing skills or community skills

**⚡ Proactive Use:**
When you detect potential patterns during normal conversation, offer:
```
💭 Pattern detected: This is the [Xth] time you've asked me to [action].

Would you like me to analyze your conversation history for similar 
patterns and recommend a Custom Skill? I can identify other automation 
opportunities you might not have noticed.

[Yes, analyze] [Not now]
```
