# Angular 3D Scene Crafter

Create stunning 3D scenes using the @hive-academy/angular-3d library through guided, conversational design.

## Overview

This skill helps you design and generate complete Angular components for 3D scenes by:

- Guiding aesthetic and mood selection
- Recommending components based on scene type
- Applying proven composition patterns
- Configuring materials, lighting, and animations
- Generating production-ready Angular code

## Workflow

The skill supports two primary workflows:

- **A. Text-Based Design** - Conversational scene crafting from user descriptions
- **B. Image-Based Reverse Engineering** - Analyze reference images and recreate similar scenes

---

## Workflow A: Image-Based Reverse Engineering

**Use when:** User provides a reference image or screenshot of a desired 3D scene aesthetic.

### 1. Request and Analyze Image

Ask user to provide the reference image:

- "Please share the image you'd like to recreate"
- "I can analyze screenshots, design mockups, or existing 3D scenes"

### 2. Perform Visual Analysis

When image is provided, analyze these key aspects:

#### Color Palette Extraction

- Identify dominant colors (background, primary objects, accents)
- Note color temperature (warm vs cool)
- Detect color scheme type (monochrome, complementary, triadic)
- Extract hex values for key colors

**Example analysis:**

```
Colors detected:
- Background: Very dark (#0a0a0f - deep space)
- Primary: Cyan (#00d4ff)
- Secondary: Purple (#a855f7)
- Accent: Pink (#f472b6)
- Scheme: Cool complementary with warm accent
```

#### Lighting Analysis

- Count visible light sources
- Identify light types (ambient, directional, point, spot)
- Note light positions (top-left, rim, front)
- Assess lighting mood (dramatic, soft, high-contrast)

**Example analysis:**

```
Lighting setup:
- Very low ambient (dark dramatic mood)
- Strong rim light from upper-left (creates edge highlights)
- Colored accent light (purple tint on left side)
- Setup matches: Three-point professional OR dramatic rim lighting
```

#### Material & Surface Analysis

- Identify material types (glossy, matte, emissive, glass, metallic)
- Note special effects (wireframe, glow, transparency, iridescence)
- Detect surface treatments (smooth, rough, reflective)

**Example analysis:**

```
Materials:
- Sphere 1: Glass/transmission (visible refraction, clearcoat)
- Sphere 2: Emissive glow (self-illuminated wireframe)
- Background: Particle field (soft bokeh points)
- Effects: Strong bloom on emissive elements
```

#### Geometry & Composition

- Identify primitive shapes (spheres, boxes, toruses, cylinders)
- Note spatial arrangement (grid, scatter, corner framing, clustering)
- Assess depth layering (foreground/midground/background)
- Count objects and note size hierarchy

**Example analysis:**

```
Composition:
- 3 spheres: Large (focal), Medium (secondary), Small (accent)
- Layout: Focal clustering pattern (off-center primary)
- Depth: Foreground spheres (z=0), Background particles (z=-30)
- Camera: Standard perspective (FOV ~75°, distance ~20 units)
```

#### Animation & Effects

- Detect motion blur or animation trails
- Note particles or dynamic elements
- Identify post-processing (bloom, depth of field, chromatic aberration)

**Example analysis:**

```
Effects:
- Strong bloom (glow around bright elements)
- Particle background (static star field or animated?)
- No visible motion blur (static scene or slow animation)
- Depth of field: None detected (all elements sharp)
```

### 3. Map to Available Components

Based on analysis, recommend specific angular-3d components:

**Primitives:**

```
Detected: Spheres → Use: <a3d-sphere> or <a3d-marble-sphere> or <a3d-glass-sphere>
Detected: Torus → Use: <a3d-torus>
Detected: Particle field → Use: <a3d-star-field> or <a3d-particle-system>
Detected: Nebula cloud → Use: <a3d-nebula-volumetric>
```

**Materials:**

```
Detected: Glass with refraction → Config: [transmission]="0.9" [ior]="1.5" [clearcoat]="1.0"
Detected: Emissive glow → Config: [emissive]="color" [emissiveIntensity]="2" [wireframe]="true"
Detected: Iridescent rainbow → Config: [iridescence]="1.0" [iridescenceThicknessMin]="100"
```

**Lighting:**

```
Detected: Dramatic rim → Use: Directional light setup (main + rim)
Detected: Colored accents → Use: Multiple point lights with colors
```

**Effects:**

```
Detected: Strong bloom → Use: <a3d-bloom-effect [threshold]="0.5" [strength]="1.2" />
Detected: Selective glow → Use: <a3d-selective-bloom-effect [layer]="1" />
```

### 4. Identify Closest Scene Pattern

Match the analyzed scene to one of the proven patterns from [patterns.md](references/patterns.md):

**Pattern matching logic:**

- Emissive + wireframe + strong bloom → **Cyberpunk Neon**
- Spheres + transmission + iridescence → **Glass/Bubble**
- Planets + stars + nebula → **Space/Cosmic**
- Polyhedrons + environment reflections → **Geometric Abstract**
- Particles + volumetric elements → **Particle Effects**
- Marble shader + glossy materials → **Organic/Fluid**

**Output:**

```
"Based on the image analysis, this matches our **Glass/Bubble** scene pattern:
- Transmission materials with iridescence
- Three-point lighting (key + fill + rim)
- Corner framing composition
- Purple/pink color palette
- Subtle bloom for refinement

I'll recreate this using <a3d-glass-sphere> components with iridescence,
three-point lighting setup, and matching post-processing."
```

### 5. Generate Reconstruction Code

Provide the complete Angular component that recreates the scene:

```typescript
import { Component, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';
import {
  Scene3dComponent,
  SphereComponent,
  StarFieldComponent,
  // ... other imports
} from '@hive-academy/angular-3d';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-reconstructed-scene',
  // ... component configuration
  template: `
    <a3d-scene-3d [cameraPosition]="[0, 0, 20]" [backgroundColor]="0x0a0a0f">
      <!-- Reconstructed based on image analysis -->

      <!-- Primary focal sphere (glass with iridescence) -->
      <a3d-sphere [args]="[3, 64, 64]" [position]="[2, 0, 0]" [color]="'#e879f9'" [transmission]="0.9" [iridescence]="1.0" [iridescenceThicknessMin]="100" [iridescenceThicknessMax]="400" />

      <!-- ... more components matching the analyzed scene -->

      <!-- Three-point lighting (detected from image) -->
      <a3d-ambient-light [intensity]="0.3" />
      <a3d-spot-light [position]="[0, 16, -6]" [intensity]="120" />
      <a3d-point-light [position]="[-10, 10, -10]" [color]="'#a855f7'" />

      <!-- Bloom effect (strong glow detected) -->
      <a3d-effect-composer>
        <a3d-bloom-effect [threshold]="0.85" [strength]="0.4" />
      </a3d-effect-composer>
    </a3d-scene-3d>
  `,
})
export class ReconstructedSceneComponent {}
```

### 6. Provide Customization Notes

After generating code, explain approximations and suggest refinements:

**Approximations made:**

- "Estimated sphere positions based on perspective"
- "Bloom threshold approximated from glow intensity"
- "Camera distance inferred from field of view"

**Refinement suggestions:**

- "Adjust sphere positions: `[position]` values for exact placement"
- "Fine-tune colors: Use exact hex values if available"
- "Tweak bloom: Lower `threshold` for more glow, adjust `strength`"
- "Add animations: Consider `float3d` or `rotate3d` for motion"

---

## Workflow B: Text-Based Design

**Use when:** User describes desired scene verbally without reference image.

### 1. Discover User Intent

Ask about the desired scene aesthetic and purpose:

**Questions to ask:**

- "What mood or aesthetic are you aiming for?" (cyberpunk, cosmic, dreamy, energetic, minimal)
- "What's the scene's purpose?" (hero section, background, interactive feature, showcase)
- "Any specific visual elements you want?" (planets, particles, glass, geometry, text)
- "Do you have a color preference?" (neon, warm, cool, monochrome)

### 2. Recommend Scene Type

Based on user responses, suggest one or more scene types from these proven patterns:

**Scene Type Reference:**

- **Cyberpunk Neon** - Wireframe geometry, emissive materials, strong bloom, cyan/magenta palette
- **Space/Cosmic** - Planets, star fields, nebulas, dramatic lighting, deep blues
- **Glass/Bubble** - Transparent spheres, iridescence, transmission, soft lighting
- **Geometric Abstract** - Polyhedrons, PBR materials, environment reflections, scattered layout
- **Particle Effects** - Particle systems, volumetric text, nebula backgrounds, electric colors
- **Organic/Fluid** - Metaballs, marble shaders, TSL materials, smooth animations
- **Cloud/Atmospheric** - Cloud layers, fog, day/night modes, selective bloom

For each suggestion, reference similar examples from hero scenes and explain why it matches their goals.

### 3. Build Scene Incrementally

Guide users through adding components in this order:

#### A. Scene Container & Camera

```typescript
<a3d-scene-3d
  [cameraPosition]="[0, 0, 20]"
  [cameraFov]="75"
  [backgroundColor]="0x0a0a0f"
  [enableShadows]="false">
  <!-- Components go here -->
</a3d-scene-3d>
```

**Configuration tips:**

- `cameraPosition`: Adjust Z for desired view distance (10-30 typical)
- `backgroundColor`: Use ultra-dark (0x0a0a0f - 0x050510) for contrast
- `enableShadows`: Only enable if using shadow-casting lights

#### B. Primitives & Objects

Recommend components from [components.md](references/components.md) based on scene type:

**For geometric scenes:**

- `<a3d-box>`, `<a3d-sphere>`, `<a3d-cylinder>`, `<a3d-torus>`, `<a3d-polyhedron>`

**For space/cosmic:**

- `<a3d-planet>`, `<a3d-star-field>`, `<a3d-nebula-volumetric>`

**For effects:**

- `<a3d-particle-system>`, `<a3d-marble-sphere>`, `<a3d-glass-sphere>`, `<a3d-metaball>`

**For text:**

- `<a3d-troika-text>`, `<a3d-glow-troika-text>`, `<a3d-bubble-text>`, `<a3d-particle-text>`

Apply composition patterns from [patterns.md](references/patterns.md):

- **Grid distribution** - Evenly spaced objects
- **Asymmetric scatter** - Irregular positioning for organic feel
- **Corner framing** - Objects at edges frame central content
- **Focal clustering** - Size hierarchy with primary focus
- **Layered depth** - Z-position ranges (0 to -80)

#### C. Materials & Colors

Configure materials based on aesthetic. See [best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md) for detailed guidance.

**Quick material patterns:**

**Emissive wireframe (neon):**

```typescript
[wireframe] = 'true'[emissive] = "'#00ffff'"[emissiveIntensity] = '2'[color] = "'#00ffff'";
```

**Glass/transparent:**

```typescript
[transmission] = '0.9'[thickness] = '0.5'[ior] = '1.4'[clearcoat] = '1.0'[clearcoatRoughness] = '0.0'[roughness] = '0.0';
```

**PBR with environment:**

```typescript
<a3d-environment [preset]="'sunset'" [intensity]="0.5" />
[color]="'#6366f1'"
[metalness]="0.3"
[roughness]="0.5"
```

**Iridescent (soap bubble):**

```typescript
[transmission] = '0.9'[iridescence] = '1.0'[iridescenceIOR] = '1.3'[iridescenceThicknessMin] = '100'[iridescenceThicknessMax] = '400';
```

#### D. Lighting Setup

Recommend lighting based on scene type:

**Cyberpunk/Neon:**

```typescript
<a3d-ambient-light [intensity]="0.1" />
<a3d-point-light [position]="[0, 0, 10]" [color]="'#00ffff'" [intensity]="2" />
<a3d-point-light [position]="[-10, 5, 5]" [color]="'#ff00ff'" [intensity]="1.5" />
```

**Space/Dramatic:**

```typescript
<a3d-ambient-light [intensity]="0.2" />
<a3d-directional-light [position]="[15, 8, 10]" [intensity]="1.6" />
<a3d-directional-light [position]="[-10, 5, -5]" [intensity]="0.25" [color]="'#4a90d9'" />
```

**Glass/Bubble (three-point):**

```typescript
<a3d-ambient-light [intensity]="0.3" />
<a3d-spot-light [position]="[0, 16, -6]" [intensity]="120" [angle]="0.5" />
<a3d-point-light [position]="[-10, 10, -10]" [intensity]="25" [color]="'#a855f7'" />
<a3d-point-light [position]="[10, 6, -8]" [intensity]="15" [color]="'#f472b6'" />
```

#### E. Animation & Interactivity

Add directives for motion. See [components.md](references/components.md) for directive details.

**Float animation:**

```typescript
<a3d-sphere
  float3d
  [floatConfig]="{
    height: 0.5,
    speed: 2500,
    delay: 0,
    ease: 'sine.inOut'
  }"
/>
```

**Rotation:**

```typescript
<a3d-planet
  rotate3d
  [rotateConfig]="{
    axis: 'y',
    speed: 60
  }"
/>
```

**Mouse tracking:**

```typescript
<a3d-box
  mouseTracking3d
  [trackingConfig]="{
    sensitivity: 0.3,
    damping: 0.08
  }"
/>
```

**Best practices:**

- Stagger delays (200ms, 400ms, 600ms) for wave-like choreography
- Vary speeds to prevent synchronization
- Use slow rotation (0.003-0.015) for ambient motion
- Apply mouseTracking to create responsive scenes

#### F. Post-Processing Effects

Configure effects based on mood:

**Strong bloom (neon scenes):**

```typescript
<a3d-effect-composer>
  <a3d-bloom-effect
    [threshold]="0.5"
    [strength]="1.2"
    [radius]="0.4"
  />
</a3d-effect-composer>
```

**Subtle bloom (refined scenes):**

```typescript
<a3d-effect-composer>
  <a3d-bloom-effect
    [threshold]="0.9"
    [strength]="0.3"
    [radius]="0.5"
  />
</a3d-effect-composer>
```

**Selective bloom (precise control):**

```typescript
<a3d-effect-composer>
  <a3d-selective-bloom-effect
    [layer]="1"
    [threshold]="0"
    [strength]="1.5"
  />
</a3d-effect-composer>
<!-- Objects on layer 1 will glow -->
```

### 4. Generate Complete Component

After building incrementally, generate the complete Angular component:

**Component structure:**

```typescript
import { Component, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';
import {
  Scene3dComponent,
  // Import components used in template
} from '@hive-academy/angular-3d';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-scene',
  imports: [
    Scene3dComponent,
    // List all imported components
  ],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  template: `
    <a3d-scene-3d [cameraPosition]="[0, 0, 20]" [backgroundColor]="0x0a0a0f">
      <!-- Primitives & Objects -->

      <!-- Lighting -->

      <!-- Effects -->
      <a3d-effect-composer>
        <a3d-bloom-effect [threshold]="0.7" [strength]="0.8" />
      </a3d-effect-composer>

      <!-- Controls (optional) -->
      <a3d-orbit-controls />
    </a3d-scene-3d>
  `,
  styles: `
    :host {
      display: block;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100vh;
    }
  `,
})
export class MySceneComponent {}
```

**Best practices for generated code:**

- Use standalone components (no NgModules)
- Use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`
- Import only components used in template
- Include host styles for proper sizing
- Add comments for each section (primitives, lighting, effects)
- Use signal-based inputs where available

### 5. Provide Customization Guidance

After generating the component, offer customization suggestions:

**Quick tweaks:**

- "Adjust `cameraPosition` Z value to zoom in/out"
- "Change `backgroundColor` for different moods"
- "Modify `[intensity]` on lights to brighten/dim"
- "Adjust bloom `threshold` (lower = more glow)"
- "Try different float `height` and `speed` values"

**Advanced enhancements:**

- "Add `<a3d-fog>` for atmospheric depth"
- "Include `<a3d-orbit-controls>` for user interaction"
- "Layer multiple star fields with different rotations for parallax"
- "Combine directives (float3d + rotate3d + mouseTracking3d)"

## Ready-to-Use Scene Templates

The `assets/scenes/` folder contains complete, production-ready scene components that can be used as starting drafts. Each template is heavily documented with customization points.

### Template Selection Guide

| User Intent                     | Template                                                                       | Key Features                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Cyberpunk, neon, gaming vibe"  | [crystal-grid-neon.component.ts](assets/scenes/crystal-grid-neon.component.ts) | Wireframe toruses, emissive materials, strong bloom, auto-rotating orbit    |
| "Interactive geometric shapes"  | [floating-geometry.component.ts](assets/scenes/floating-geometry.component.ts) | Multiple polyhedrons, float + mouse tracking, environment reflections       |
| "Dreamy, luxury, glass bubbles" | [bubble-dream-hero.component.ts](assets/scenes/bubble-dream-hero.component.ts) | Transmission spheres, nebula background, HTML overlay, three-point lighting |
| "Space, cosmic, planets"        | [space-cosmic-hero.component.ts](assets/scenes/space-cosmic-hero.component.ts) | Star field layers, nebula, marble planet, particle dust                     |
| "Organic, fluid, morphing"      | [metaball-organic.component.ts](assets/scenes/metaball-organic.component.ts)   | MetaballSystem with orbiting globs, environment mapping                     |
| "Dynamic, energetic, storm"     | [particle-storm.component.ts](assets/scenes/particle-storm.component.ts)       | Multi-layer particles, vortex animation, energy core                        |

### Using Templates

1. **Copy as first draft**: When user describes a scene matching one of these aesthetics, offer the template as a starting point
2. **Customize key values**: Each template has documented customization points in comments
3. **Combine patterns**: Mix elements from multiple templates for unique scenes

**Example workflow:**

```
User: "I want something with glass bubbles and a dreamy feel"

You: "Perfect! I have a Bubble Dream template that matches this exactly. It includes:
     - Glass spheres with transmission and clearcoat
     - Dreamy nebula background in pink/purple
     - Spotlight per bubble for dramatic lighting
     - HTML overlay support for your content

     Here's the template: [bubble-dream-hero.component.ts](assets/scenes/bubble-dream-hero.component.ts)

     Customization points for your needs:
     - Change `nebulaColors` for different mood
     - Adjust bubble positions for your layout
     - Add [iridescence]="1.0" for soap bubble effect
     - Modify hero-content in the overlay layer"
```

## Reference Files

Load these as needed during scene crafting:

- **[components.md](references/components.md)** - Complete component catalog with all inputs, directives, and services
- **[patterns.md](references/patterns.md)** - Scene composition patterns from 8 proven hero scenes
- **[best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md)** - Detailed guides for color, materials, lighting, animation, and effects

## Tips for Effective Scene Crafting

1. **Start simple** - Begin with basic shapes and build complexity
2. **Use dark backgrounds** - Ultra-dark (0x0a0a0f) makes colors pop
3. **Layer depth** - Vary Z positions (0 to -80) for dimensionality
4. **Match lights to colors** - Colored point lights enhance object colors
5. **Stagger animations** - Delays create organic choreography
6. **Preview iteratively** - Show code for each step, then complete component
7. **Explain choices** - Reference similar hero scenes and explain why patterns work

## Example Interaction Flow

```
User: "I want a cyberpunk neon scene"

You: "Great! For a cyberpunk neon aesthetic, I recommend the Crystal Grid pattern with
     emissive wireframe geometry and strong bloom. This creates that electric,
     high-contrast look. Would you like:
     - Geometric shapes (boxes, toruses, polyhedrons)?
     - Cyan/magenta/yellow neon palette?
     - Strong glow effects with bloom?

     Any specific elements you want to include?"

User: "Yes, use toruses and that color palette"

You: "Perfect! Let's build this step by step.

     **Step 1: Scene Container**
     [show camera setup code]

     **Step 2: Add Toruses in Grid Layout**
     [show 3-5 torus primitives with positions, emissive materials]

     **Step 3: Colored Point Lights**
     [show cyan and magenta point lights matching torus colors]

     **Step 4: Add Rotation Animations**
     [show rotate3d directives with different axes]

     **Step 5: Strong Bloom Effect**
     [show bloom effect with low threshold]

     Here's your complete component:
     [show full Angular component code]

     You can customize by adjusting the emissiveIntensity, bloom strength,
     or rotation speeds!"
```

This conversational approach ensures users understand each decision and can request modifications.
