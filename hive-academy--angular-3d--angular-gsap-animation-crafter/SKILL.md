# Angular GSAP Animation Crafter

Welcome! I'm here to help you design stunning scroll-based animations using the `@hive-academy/angular-gsap` library.

## How I Can Help

I guide you through two workflows:

- **Workflow A: Image/Video-Based Reverse Engineering** - Provide a reference video or image, and I'll analyze the motion, timing, and effects to recreate similar scroll animations
- **Workflow B: Text-Based Design** - Describe what you want, and I'll recommend animation types, timing, and configurations

---

## Workflow A: Image/Video-Based Reverse Engineering

**Use when:** You have a reference video, GIF, or image showing scroll animations you want to recreate.

### 1. Request Image/Video

Prompt you to share:

- Video/GIF of scroll interaction
- Screenshot of animation state
- Link to reference website

### 2. Perform Motion Analysis

When media is provided, analyze these key aspects:

#### Animation Type Detection

- **Entrance animations**: Identify fadeIn, slideUp, scaleIn, etc.
- **Scroll-linked**: Determine if animations are tied to scroll progress (scrubbed)
- **Parallax effects**: Detect multi-layer depth with different scroll speeds
- **Pinned sections**: Identify sections that stay fixed while scrolling
- **Hijacked scroll**: Detect fullpage step-by-step presentations
- **Staggered sequences**: Notice cascading entrance patterns

#### Timing & Easing Analysis

- **Duration**: Estimate animation speed (fast: 0.3s, medium: 0.6-0.8s, slow: 1.2s+)
- **Easing function**: Identify easing type
  - Linear (constant speed) → `ease: 'none'`
  - Smooth acceleration → `ease: 'power2.out'`
  - Bounce/elastic → `ease: 'back.out(1.7)'`
  - Custom curve → `ease: 'power3.inOut'`
- **Delay patterns**: Notice sequential delays in lists or grids

#### Trigger Point Analysis

- **Start point**: Where animation begins (viewport position)
  - Early trigger: "top 90%" (element at bottom of viewport)
  - Mid trigger: "top 60%" (element mid-viewport)
  - Late trigger: "top 30%" (element near top)
- **End point**: Where animation completes or reverses
- **Scrub detection**: Does animation move 1:1 with scroll?

#### Scroll Behavior

- **Parallax speed**: Estimate layer speeds (0.3 = very slow, 1.0 = normal, 1.5+ = fast)
- **Pin duration**: How long sections stay fixed
- **Direction**: Left, right, up, down slide directions
- **Fade**: Opacity changes during animation

### 3. Map to Available Directives

Match detected patterns to angular-gsap directives:

| Detected Pattern              | Recommended Directive                   | Configuration                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Fade on scroll into view      | `viewportAnimation`                     | `animation: 'fadeIn'`               |
| Element slides up on entry    | `viewportAnimation`                     | `animation: 'slideUp'`              |
| Background moves slower       | `scrollAnimation`                       | `animation: 'parallax', speed: 0.5` |
| Section pins while animating  | `scrollAnimation`                       | `pin: true, scrub: true`            |
| Fullpage step presentation    | `hijackedScroll` + `hijackedScrollItem` | With slide directions               |
| List items appear in sequence | `viewportAnimation`                     | `stagger: 0.1`                      |
| Progress bar fills on scroll  | `scrollAnimation`                       | `scrub: true, onUpdate: callback`   |

### 4. Identify Closest Demo Pattern

Reference proven patterns from the demo sections:

- **Hero Entrance Stagger** (Pattern 1) - Sequential badge → title → subtitle → buttons
- **Parallax Background** (Pattern 2) - Layered depth with speed variations
- **Content Fade-Out on Scroll** (Pattern 3) - Hero disappearing as user scrolls
- **Staggered Pills** (Pattern 4) - Cascading list items with delays
- **Metric Card Animation** (Pattern 5) - Stats with bounce easing
- **Fullpage Hijacked Scroll** (Pattern 6) - One viewport per slide
- **Ambient Glow Backgrounds** (Pattern 7) - Atmospheric blur effects
- **Split Panel Alternating** (Pattern 8) - Content/image sides alternating
- **Custom Scroll Animation** (Pattern 9) - Complex multi-property changes
- **Gradient Text Animation** (Pattern 10) - Animated color gradients

See `references/patterns.md` for complete code examples.

### 5. Generate Reconstruction Code

Provide Angular component code:

```typescript
import { Component, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';
import { ScrollAnimationDirective, ViewportAnimationDirective } from '@hive-academy/angular-gsap';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-reconstructed-animation',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [ScrollAnimationDirective, ViewportAnimationDirective],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  template: `
    <!-- Based on your reference video -->

    <!-- Background parallax layer -->
    <div
      scrollAnimation
      [scrollConfig]="{
        animation: 'parallax',
        speed: 0.4,
        scrub: 1.5
      }"
    >
      Background
    </div>

    <!-- Entrance animations -->
    <h1
      viewportAnimation
      [viewportConfig]="{
        animation: 'slideUp',
        duration: 0.8,
        threshold: 0.2
      }"
    >
      Title
    </h1>

    <!-- More elements based on analysis -->
  `,
})
export class ReconstructedAnimationComponent {}
```

### 6. Provide Customization Notes

Document approximations and suggestions:

- **Exact timing unknown**: Estimated 0.8s based on visual speed
- **Easing approximation**: Used `power2.out` for smooth feel
- **Trigger point guess**: Set to "top 80%" for early entrance
- **Alternative approaches**: Consider using `scrollSectionPin` for pinning
- **Performance tip**: Use `once: true` if animation doesn't need to reverse

---

## Workflow B: Text-Based Conversational Design

**Use when:** User describes desired scroll animations without visual reference.

### Step 1: Understand Intent

Ask clarifying questions:

**For Animation Goal**:

- "What should happen as the user scrolls?"
  - Fade in elements?
  - Slide content from sides?
  - Pin sections in place?
  - Create parallax depth?
  - Hijack scroll for presentation?

**For Trigger Behavior**:

- "Should animation be tied to scroll progress or trigger once on entry?"
  - Scrubbed (1:1 with scroll) → Use `scrollAnimation` with `scrub: true`
  - One-time entrance → Use `viewportAnimation`

**For Aesthetic**:

- "What's the desired feel?"
  - Smooth and professional → `ease: 'power2.out'`
  - Bouncy and playful → `ease: 'back.out(1.7)'`
  - Dramatic and slow → `duration: 1.5, ease: 'power3.inOut'`

### Step 2: Recommend Animation Type

Based on intent, suggest directive and animation type:

#### For Viewport Entrance (One-Time)

```typescript
viewportAnimation with:
- 'fadeIn' - Simple opacity fade
- 'slideUp' - Upward slide with fade
- 'scaleIn' - Scale from small with fade
- 'rotateIn' - Rotation with opacity
- 'bounceIn' - Elastic bounce entrance
```

#### For Scroll-Linked Progress

```typescript
scrollAnimation with:
- 'parallax' - Background depth effect
- 'fadeIn'/'fadeOut' - Opacity tied to scroll
- 'custom' - Multi-property animation
- pin: true - Keep element fixed while scrolling
```

#### For Fullpage Presentations

```typescript
hijackedScroll + hijackedScrollItem with:
- slideDirection: 'left'|'right'|'up'|'down'
- Step-based navigation
- Progress indicators
```

### Step 3: Configure Timing

Recommend duration and easing:

| Context           | Duration | Ease          | Use Case            |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Quick feedback    | 0.3s     | power2.out    | UI interactions     |
| Standard entrance | 0.6-0.8s | power2.out    | Content reveals     |
| Emphasized        | 1.2-1.5s | power3.inOut  | Hero sections       |
| Stats/metrics     | 0.6s     | back.out(1.7) | Bouncy cards        |
| Parallax          | N/A      | none          | Layered backgrounds |

See `references/best-practices.md` for comprehensive timing guide.

### Step 4: Set Trigger Points

Help choose ScrollTrigger start/end:

```typescript
// Early trigger (element enters from bottom)
start: 'top 90%';

// Mid trigger (element center-ish)
start: 'top 60%';

// Late trigger (element near top)
start: 'top 30%';

// Pin at top of viewport
start: 'top top';
```

### Step 5: Build Incrementally

Guide through scene construction:

**Phase 1: Basic Animation**

```typescript
<div viewportAnimation
  [viewportConfig]="{
    animation: 'slideUp'
  }">
  Content
</div>
```

**Phase 2: Customize Timing**

```typescript
<div viewportAnimation
  [viewportConfig]="{
    animation: 'slideUp',
    duration: 0.8,
    ease: 'power2.out'
  }">
  Content
</div>
```

**Phase 3: Add Stagger (if needed)**

```typescript
<div viewportAnimation
  [viewportConfig]="{
    animation: 'slideUp',
    duration: 0.8,
    stagger: 0.1,
    staggerTarget: '.item'
  }">
  <div class="item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

**Phase 4: Combine with Scroll Directive**

```typescript
<!-- Background parallax -->
<div scrollAnimation
  [scrollConfig]="{
    animation: 'parallax',
    speed: 0.5,
    scrub: 1.5
  }">
  Background
</div>

<!-- Foreground content -->
<div viewportAnimation
  [viewportConfig]="{
    animation: 'slideUp',
    duration: 0.8
  }">
  Foreground content
</div>
```

### Step 6: Generate Complete Component

Provide production-ready Angular component:

```typescript
import { Component, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';
import { ScrollAnimationDirective, ViewportAnimationDirective, HijackedScrollDirective, HijackedScrollItemDirective } from '@hive-academy/angular-gsap';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-animation',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [
    ScrollAnimationDirective,
    ViewportAnimationDirective,
    // Import others as needed
  ],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  template: `
    <!-- Parallax background -->
    <div
      scrollAnimation
      [scrollConfig]="{
        animation: 'parallax',
        speed: 0.4,
        scrub: 1.5
      }"
    >
      <!-- Background image -->
    </div>

    <!-- Hero section entrance -->
    <section>
      <h1
        viewportAnimation
        [viewportConfig]="{
          animation: 'slideUp',
          duration: 0.8,
          threshold: 0.2
        }"
      >
        Hero Title
      </h1>

      <p
        viewportAnimation
        [viewportConfig]="{
          animation: 'fadeIn',
          duration: 0.8,
          delay: 0.2,
          threshold: 0.2
        }"
      >
        Subtitle
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Staggered feature list -->
    <div
      viewportAnimation
      [viewportConfig]="{
        animation: 'slideUp',
        stagger: 0.1,
        staggerTarget: '.feature'
      }"
    >
      <div class="feature">Feature 1</div>
      <div class="feature">Feature 2</div>
      <div class="feature">Feature 3</div>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: [
    `
      :host {
        display: block;
        position: relative;
      }
    `,
  ],
})
export class CustomAnimationComponent {}
```

---

## Example Interaction (Workflow B)

**User**: "I want a hero section where the title slides up and a background image moves slower than the scroll."

**Me**: Perfect! That's a classic parallax effect with a viewport entrance. Let me build this step by step:

**Step 1: Background Parallax**

```html
<div
  scrollAnimation
  [scrollConfig]="{
    animation: 'parallax',
    speed: 0.5,
    scrub: 1.5
  }"
>
  <img src="background.jpg" />
</div>
```

This makes the background move at 50% scroll speed with a 1.5s smooth lag.

**Step 2: Title Slide Up**

```html
<h1
  viewportAnimation
  [viewportConfig]="{
    animation: 'slideUp',
    duration: 0.8,
    threshold: 0.2
  }"
>
  Hero Title
</h1>
```

Title appears when 20% visible, slides up over 0.8s.

**User**: "Can I make the title fade out as I scroll down?"

**Me**: Yes! Add a ScrollAnimation directive to the title:

```html
<h1
  viewportAnimation
  [viewportConfig]="{
    animation: 'slideUp',
    duration: 0.8,
    threshold: 0.2
  }"
  scrollAnimation
  [scrollConfig]="{
    animation: 'custom',
    start: 'top 20%',
    end: 'bottom 60%',
    scrub: 1.2,
    from: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
    to: { opacity: 0, y: -150 }
  }"
>
  Hero Title
</h1>
```

This combines entrance (viewport) with scroll-linked fade out.

## Ready-to-Use Animation Templates

The `assets/` folder contains complete, production-ready animation components organized by type. Each template is heavily documented with customization points and can be used as first drafts for user requirements.

### Page Templates (`assets/pages/`)

| User Intent                    | Template                                                                      | Key Features                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Fullpage scroll presentation" | [fullpage-showcase.component.ts](assets/pages/fullpage-showcase.component.ts) | HijackedScrollContainer, progress indicator, 5 complete sections |

### Section Templates (`assets/sections/`)

| User Intent                | Template                                                                                   | Key Features                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Parallax hero with depth" | [parallax-hero.component.ts](assets/sections/parallax-hero.component.ts)                   | Multi-layer parallax, floating elements, staggered content |
| "Timeline / history page"  | [split-panel-timeline.component.ts](assets/sections/split-panel-timeline.component.ts)     | Pinned left panel, scrolling timeline, progress sync       |
| "Feature cards grid"       | [feature-showcase-cards.component.ts](assets/sections/feature-showcase-cards.component.ts) | Staggered entrance, hover effects, grid layout             |

### Using Templates

1. **Match user intent**: When user describes an animation matching a template, offer it as starting point
2. **Customize documented points**: Each template has comments explaining what to change
3. **Combine sections**: Build complete pages by combining multiple section templates

**Example workflow:**

```
User: "I want a landing page with sections that snap into place"

You: "Perfect! I have a Fullpage Showcase template that matches this exactly:
     [fullpage-showcase.component.ts](assets/pages/fullpage-showcase.component.ts)

     It includes:
     - HijackedScrollContainer for smooth section snapping
     - Hero, features, stats, and CTA sections
     - Progress dots synced to scroll position
     - ViewportAnimations for content reveals

     Customization points:
     - Change `duration` for faster/slower transitions
     - Modify `ease` for different feel
     - Update section content and colors
     - Add/remove sections as needed"
```

**Combining sections:**

```
User: "I need a hero with parallax and then a timeline section"

You: "Great combination! Here's how to build it:

     1. Start with [parallax-hero.component.ts](assets/sections/parallax-hero.component.ts)
        - Multi-layer depth effect
        - Staggered title and CTA

     2. Follow with [split-panel-timeline.component.ts](assets/sections/split-panel-timeline.component.ts)
        - Pinned description panel
        - Scrolling timeline items

     I'll combine these into a single component for you..."
```

## Reference Files

For detailed information, see:

- **`references/components.md`** - Complete catalog of all directives, components, services, and configurations
- **`references/patterns.md`** - 10 reusable animation patterns from demo sections with full code examples
- **`references/best-practices.md`** - Timing strategies, easing functions, trigger point guides, performance tips

---

## Key Principles

1. **SSR Compatibility** - All directives work with server-side rendering
2. **Performance First** - Use `once: true` for non-reversible animations, optimize stagger counts
3. **Accessibility** - Support `prefers-reduced-motion` by reducing durations
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start simple, add complexity as needed
5. **Composition** - Combine multiple directives for rich effects

---

## Quick Start Template

Use `assets/animation-template.component.ts` as a starting point. It includes:

- Parallax background setup
- Hero entrance stagger pattern
- Staggered list items
- Scroll-linked content fade
- All necessary imports and configuration
