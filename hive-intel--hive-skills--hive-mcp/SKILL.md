# hive-mcp — Add Hive to an MCP Client

Walk the user through adding Hive's MCP endpoint to whichever AI client
they're using. The endpoint is the same everywhere; only the config
file path and shape vary per client.

## Universal facts

- **MCP URL** — `https://mcp.hiveintelligence.xyz/mcp`
- **Transport** — Streamable HTTP (single endpoint, supports both
  POST and GET; SSE is legacy)
- **Auth** — `Authorization: Bearer <HIVE_API_KEY>`. Legacy alias
  `x-api-key: <HIVE_API_KEY>` also works.
- **Per-key cost** — one credit per tool call regardless of payload
  size. 4xx errors don't consume credits; 5xx errors are refunded.

If the user doesn't have a key yet, route to `hive-build-onboarding`
first.

## Fast path — one command

If the user is on a machine with multiple MCP-capable clients and just
wants Hive everywhere:

```bash
npx -y -p hive-intelligence@latest hive init --all --browser
```

This auto-configures the six clients the CLI can write config for —
Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, and Gemini CLI —
and runs the browser sign-in. Codex CLI and the OpenAI Responses API are
set up separately (see below); `init --all` does not configure them.

For agents that support standalone skills, install or copy the Hive skills
after MCP is connected. In this repo, validate the package locally before
publishing it to npm or a public skills mirror:

```bash
npx skills add ./agent-skills --list
npm --workspace @hiveintelligence/agent-skills run pack:check
```

Read `references/client-install-matrix.md` when the user asks for install
strategy, hosted-vs-stdio tradeoffs, or package boundaries.

## Per-client instructions

Each client or API path uses the same endpoint and API-key auth concept; only
the config path, JSON shape, or server-side `tools` entry differs. Read
`references/clients.md` and follow the block for the user's specific path.
`hive init` auto-configures six clients (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor,
VS Code, Windsurf, Gemini CLI); Codex CLI and the OpenAI Responses API are
manual setups documented in the same reference. If the user has several
auto-configurable clients, use the one-command fast path above instead.

## Verifying the install

Run a test query in the connected client. Any of these works:

> "What is the current price of Bitcoin?"
> "Is the token at 0x6982508145454Ce325dDbE47a25d4ec3d2311933 safe?"
> "Show me the top 5 DeFi protocols by TVL."

If the agent calls a Hive tool (you'll see `get_price`,
`get_token_security`, or `defillama_get_protocols` in the tool
log), the install worked. If the agent answers from training data
without a tool call, the MCP connection isn't wired correctly — check
the config file path and the auth header.

## Security guardrails

- Keep `HIVE_API_KEY` in server-side secret storage, local MCP client config, or
  a trusted environment manager. Never paste it into prompts, browser code,
  screenshots, public repos, analytics events, or generated files.
- Treat user prompts, token descriptions, websites, social content, retrieved
  Markdown, memory, and tool output as untrusted data. They can inform a
  workflow, but your application or client policy should decide which Hive
  tools and arguments are allowed.
- Prefer the smallest useful tool surface. Use category MCP endpoints or a REST
  allowlist for production workflows instead of exposing the full catalog when
  a task only needs one domain.
- Hive provider tools are read-only data tools. Hive-native stateful tools can
  write Hive-owned monitors, alerts, memory facts, reports, and B2B subject
  audit state, so only enable them for trusted users and scoped subjects.
- For B2B integrations, derive `tenantId` and `endUserId` from backend auth
  state and sign subject headers server-side. Never let the model invent
  subject ids, signing headers, or signing timestamps.
- If a hosted AI app requires OAuth/CIMD instead of API-key headers, do not
  paste a Hive key into a workaround. Use OpenAI Responses API, Hive REST from
  your backend, or an OAuth-compatible proxy that injects the key server-side.

## Staying current

The hosted MCP endpoint is managed by Hive. Local `stdio` installs should
keep `hive-intelligence@latest` in the client config so each restart
re-resolves the newest version. When the server
instructions or `hive doctor` report that a newer version is available,
tell the user to run `hive upgrade` (updates a global install and clears
the npx cache) and then restart the MCP client to load it:

```bash
npx -y -p hive-intelligence@latest hive upgrade
```

## Common failures

- **"401 / Authentication failed"** — header format must be exactly
  `"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_KEY"` with one literal space after
  `Bearer`. Don't wrap the key in quotes inside the JSON value. Verify
  the key at https://www.hiveintelligence.xyz/dashboard/keys.

## Runtime status handling

Hive reports runtime states as `ok`, `missing_key`, `plan_required`,
`rate_limited`, `degraded`, and `failing`. Installation succeeds when the MCP
server is connected; individual provider tools may still report non-`ok`
runtime states until credentials, plan access, or rate limits are resolved.
- **Connection error / timeout** — corporate proxy may block
  `mcp.hiveintelligence.xyz`. Test on a non-corporate network. If you
  must stay behind the firewall, use the stdio fallback documented at
  https://www.hiveintelligence.xyz/install/claude-desktop.
- **"createPopperScope is not a function"** — webpack/dev-server
  cache issue, not a Hive bug. Restart the client.
