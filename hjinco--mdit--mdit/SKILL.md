description: Gate local publication on a review pass. Use when Codex should inspect the current branch, diff, staged changes, or working tree first, and only when that review returns zero actionable findings continue to branch setup, commit, push, and GitHub pull request creation. Use when this capability is needed.

# Review Then PR

## Overview

Run a review-first publish workflow.
Use this skill's review gate before any publish action. If the review finds any actionable issue, stop and report it. If it returns no actionable findings, publish the reviewed change as a PR.

## Workflow

1. Define the publish scope.
2. Review that exact scope with an explicit local review gate.
3. Stop immediately when the review finds anything actionable.
4. Publish only the reviewed scope when the finding set is empty.

## Step 1: Define Scope

Inspect local git state before reviewing or publishing.

Prefer the smallest real artifact:
- current branch diff against base branch
- staged diff when the user is clearly preparing a commit
- explicit file list when the worktree is mixed
- an existing PR diff when the user points at a PR

Do not silently widen scope from a small requested change to the whole repository.
Do not stage unrelated user changes.

## Step 2: Run The Review Gate

Review the exact artifact chosen in Step 1.

Cover these lenses before publishing:
- bugs and behavioral regressions
- maintainability risks that could cause near-term defects
- security or trust-boundary issues

Keep the review local to the chosen scope. Do not silently widen the review to the entire repository.

Keep the normal review contract:
- prioritize actionable findings over summary
- verify any claimed issue against the source before repeating it
- treat "no findings" as "no actionable findings found in the reviewed scope"
- mention meaningful test or validation gaps even when no findings exist

If any actionable finding exists, stop after reporting it. Do not commit, push, or open a PR.

## Step 3: Publish Only When Clean

When the review returns zero actionable findings, switch to the publish flow.

Prefer using `yeet` for the publish phase when that skill is available. Otherwise follow the same behavior directly:
- create or keep the branch according to the current branch strategy
- stage only the reviewed files
- write a focused commit
- run the most relevant checks for the touched code if they have not been run yet
- push the branch
- open a ready-for-review PR unless the user explicitly asked for a draft PR

Base the PR body on the reviewed change, not on the whole worktree.
State clearly that the change passed the review gate with no actionable findings.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask or report instead of publishing when:
- the review found issues
- the worktree contains unrelated changes and scope is ambiguous
- the repository remote or GitHub authentication is not ready
- required tests fail
- the requested publish target is ambiguous

## Output Contract

When findings exist, return:
1. findings ordered by severity
2. open questions or assumptions when they affect confidence
3. no publish actions taken

When no findings exist and publish succeeds, return:
1. explicit statement that the review gate found no actionable issues
2. branch, commit, and PR result
3. checks that were run
4. any residual risk or missing validation worth noting

## Safety

Never bypass the review gate.
Never publish changes that were not part of the reviewed artifact.
Never convert "no major issues" into "no findings"; the publish path requires zero actionable findings.
