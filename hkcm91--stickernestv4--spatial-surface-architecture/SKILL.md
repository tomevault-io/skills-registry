# Spatial Surface Architecture for StickerNest

This skill documents the recommended architecture for widget and sticker placement in 3D/VR/AR environments, based on research of state-of-the-art platform guidelines and StickerNest's specific use cases.

## Core Principle: The Room as Canvas

> "Use spatial anchors in combination with semantic surfaces (walls, table, floor) to create rich experiences. **The user's room becomes a spatial rendering canvas**."
> — Meta Horizon OS Design Guidelines

StickerNest treats surfaces (real or virtual) as the primary canvas for content placement:
- **Real surfaces** from WebXR plane/mesh detection when available
- **Virtual surfaces** from custom 3D environments as fallback
- **Free space** only when no surfaces are detected

---

## StickerNest Content Types & Placement Behavior

### Widgets (Non-Diegetic Panels)

Widgets are **floating 2D panels** displaying interactive content:

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Default Position** | 2m in front of user, eye level |
| **Movement** | Grabbable, draggable in 3D space |
| **Surface Interaction** | CAN snap to surfaces but not required |
| **Persistence** | Store world position or surface-relative position |
| **Orientation** | Billboard toward user OR fixed to surface normal |

**Design Pattern**: Like Horizon OS panels or visionOS windows

```
Widget in Space:
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   Widget Content    │  ← Floating in front of user
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
        │
        ↓ (optional snap)
════════════════════════ ← Wall surface
```

### Stickers (Diegetic Elements)

Stickers are **surface-attached visuals** that feel like real objects:

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Default Position** | Must attach to a surface |
| **Movement** | Drag along surfaces, snap between surfaces |
| **Surface Interaction** | ALWAYS attached to a surface |
| **Persistence** | Store surface-relative position (offset from anchor) |
| **Orientation** | Face outward from surface normal |

**Design Pattern**: Like physical stickers, posters, or wall decorations

```
Sticker on Wall:
                    ╔═══╗
════════════════════╣ 🎯 ╠════════════════
                    ╚═══╝
                      ↑
              Attached to wall surface
```

### Widget Launchers (Hybrid)

Stickers that open widgets when activated:

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Placement** | Surface-attached (like stickers) |
| **Activation** | Click/tap spawns associated widget |
| **Widget Spawn** | Widget appears floating near the sticker |

## Surface Priority System

When multiple surface sources are available, use this priority order:

```
Priority 1: WebXR Planes (Real World)
├── Highest confidence - actual physical surfaces
├── Semantic labels: wall, floor, ceiling, table
└── Updated in real-time as room understanding improves

Priority 2: WebXR Meshes (Quest 3+, Vision Pro)
├── Full room geometry for precise collision
├── Includes furniture, irregular surfaces
└── Use for raycasting, not individual surface tracking

Priority 3: Custom 3D Environment
├── Fallback when XR detection unavailable
├── User-loaded GLTF/GLB with collision meshes
├── Provides "virtual room" in outdoor/unscanned spaces
└── Named collision meshes: *_wall, *_floor, *_collision

Priority 4: Free Placement
├── Last resort - no surfaces available
├── Place at comfortable viewing distance
└── Allow user to manually position
```

### Implementation Pattern

```typescript
function getPlacementSurface(position: Vector3): CollisionSurface | null {
  // 1. Try XR planes first
  const xrSurface = findNearestXRPlane(position);
  if (xrSurface && xrSurface.confidence > 0.8) {
    return xrSurface;
  }

  // 2. Try XR mesh intersection
  const meshHit = raycastXRMesh(position);
  if (meshHit) {
    return meshHit;
  }

  // 3. Try custom environment surfaces
  const envSurface = findNearestEnvironmentSurface(position);
  if (envSurface) {
    return envSurface;
  }

  // 4. No surface - free placement
  return null;
}
```

## Platform Design Guidelines Summary

### Meta Horizon OS

**Panel Placement**:
- Place objects at ~1 meter distance, slightly below eye level
- Align surface-attached objects with the surface normal
- Use spatial anchors for persistence across sessions

**Interaction**:
- Grab any edge or control bar to move panels
- Drag corners to resize
- Hinged panels for related content groups

**Key Quote**:
> "Spatial anchors enable anchoring of virtual objects to a specific location or object in the physical environment."

### Apple visionOS

**Window Placement**:
- Launch apps in front of the user, within field of view
- **Never anchor to the user's head** - causes discomfort
- Use dynamic scaling (windows grow when far, shrink when near)

**Ergonomics**:
- Horizontal head movement is easier than vertical
- Avoid placing objects too high or too low
- Use wider aspect ratios when more space is needed

**Key Quote**:
> "Anchor content in people's space, giving them the freedom to look around naturally."

### Shared Best Practices

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Surface attachment over free float | Feels grounded, predictable |
| World-anchored over head-anchored | Prevents motion sickness |
| Semantic surfaces (wall/floor/table) | Enables intelligent placement |
| Visual feedback during placement | Builds user confidence |
| Snap points for precision | Reduces placement frustration |

## Diegetic vs Non-Diegetic UI

### Diegetic (In-World)

Elements that could exist within the virtual/mixed reality world:
- Stickers on walls
- Buttons on virtual devices
- Information displays on surfaces
- QR code markers with attached content

**Use for**: Surface-attached content, world-integrated experiences

### Non-Diegetic (Overlay)

Elements that exist as system UI, not part of the world:
- Floating widget panels
- System menus and toolbars
- HUD elements
- Notifications

**Use for**: Information access, system controls, temporary displays

### StickerNest Mapping

| Content Type | Category | Attachment |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Stickers | Diegetic | Surface-required |
| Widget Panels | Non-diegetic | Surface-optional |
| XR Toolbar | Non-diegetic | Follow user |
| Widget Library | Non-diegetic | Floating panel |
| Snap Indicators | Non-diegetic | Surface preview |

## AR Without Room Mapping: The Environment Fallback

When Meta Quest room mapping isn't available (outdoors, new space, user hasn't set up):

### Problem
- No XR planes detected
- No surfaces for sticker attachment
- Poor user experience for surface-attached content

### Solution: Custom 3D Environment as Virtual Room

```
Real World (Camera)
        ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Custom 3D Environment     │
│   ┌─────────────────────┐   │
│   │                     │   │
│   │   Virtual Room      │   │ ← Provides collision surfaces
│   │   with Walls        │   │
│   │                     │   │
│   └─────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
        ↓
Widgets/Stickers attach to virtual surfaces
```

### Environment Alignment Options

1. **QR Code Alignment**
   - Place physical QR code in real space
   - Scan QR to position environment origin
   - Environment aligns to real-world reference

2. **Manual Placement**
   - User places environment via AR hit test
   - Drag to position, pinch to scale
   - Confirm when aligned

3. **Marker Image Alignment** (Future)
   - Print reference image
   - Environment snaps to detected image

### Persistence Strategy

Store positions **relative to environment**, not absolute world:

```typescript
interface EnvironmentRelativePosition {
  environmentId: string;
  surfaceId: string;
  // Offset from surface centroid in surface-local coordinates
  localOffset: { x: number; y: number };
  // Distance from surface along normal
  normalOffset: number;
}
```

When environment reloads, widget positions are restored correctly even if environment moves.

## Unified Surface Registry Pattern

All surfaces (XR, environment, manual) register to a single store:

```typescript
interface CollisionSurface {
  id: string;
  type: 'wall' | 'floor' | 'ceiling' | 'table' | 'custom';
  source: 'xr-plane' | 'xr-mesh' | 'environment' | 'manual';

  // Priority for surface selection (higher = prefer)
  priority: number;

  // Geometry reference for raycasting
  mesh: THREE.Mesh | null;

  // Computed properties
  boundingBox: THREE.Box3;
  centroid: THREE.Vector3;
  normal: THREE.Vector3;

  // Snap points for this surface
  snapPoints: SnapPoint[];

  // Source tracking
  environmentId?: string;  // If from custom environment
  xrPlaneId?: string;      // If from XR detection
}
```

### Benefits of Unified Registry

1. **Single query interface** - `getNearestSurface()` works regardless of source
2. **Priority handling** - Automatically prefers XR over environment
3. **Consistent snapping** - Same snap logic for all surface types
4. **Easy debugging** - One place to visualize all surfaces
5. **Clean persistence** - Store surface reference, not raw geometry

---

## Snap Point Strategy

### Types of Snap Points

| Type | Use Case | Generation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Center | Default placement | Surface centroid |
| Corners | Alignment with edges | Bounding box corners |
| Edges | Side-by-side layout | Midpoints of edges |
| Grid | Precise arrangement | Regular spacing across surface |

### When to Show Snap Points

- **During drag**: Show available snap points on target surface
- **Within threshold**: Highlight active snap point (15cm default)
- **On release**: Snap to highlighted point if within threshold

### Snap Point Generation

```typescript
function generateSnapPoints(surface: CollisionSurface): SnapPoint[] {
  const points: SnapPoint[] = [];

  // Always include center
  points.push({
    id: `${surface.id}-center`,
    position: surface.centroid,
    normal: surface.normal,
    type: 'center',
  });

  // Add corners for walls (useful for posters, stickers)
  if (surface.type === 'wall') {
    const corners = computeBoundingBoxCorners(surface.mesh);
    corners.forEach((corner, i) => {
      points.push({
        id: `${surface.id}-corner-${i}`,
        position: corner,
        normal: surface.normal,
        type: 'corner',
      });
    });
  }

  // Add grid for tables (useful for organized layouts)
  if (surface.type === 'table') {
    const gridPoints = generateGridPoints(surface, 0.1); // 10cm grid
    points.push(...gridPoints);
  }

  return points;
}
```

## Visual Feedback Requirements

### During Placement/Drag

1. **Target Surface Highlight**
   - Semi-transparent overlay on candidate surface
   - Color indicates surface type (wall=indigo, floor=green)

2. **Snap Point Indicator**
   - Ring/circle at snap position
   - Animates when within snap threshold
   - Shows normal direction arrow

3. **Guide Lines**
   - Dashed line from object to snap point
   - Helps user understand snap relationship

### Placement Confirmation

1. **Snap Animation**
   - Brief ease-out motion to final position
   - Subtle haptic feedback (if available)

2. **Surface Attachment Indicator**
   - Brief glow on surface where attached
   - Confirms successful placement

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Surface-first, not free-first | Matches platform guidelines, feels natural |
| XR priority over environment | Real surfaces more accurate |
| Environment as fallback | Enables AR anywhere |
| Unified surface registry | Single source of truth |
| BVH for custom environments | Performance at 90fps |
| Snap points, not continuous | Intentional placement |
| Relative persistence | Survives environment repositioning |
