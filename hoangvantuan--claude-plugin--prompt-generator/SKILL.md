# Prompt Generator

Create high-quality, structured prompts using meta-prompting best practices: task decomposition, expert personas, iterative verification, and hallucination minimization.

## Workflow

### Bước 0: Detect Mode

| User cung cấp | Mode | Hành động |
|---|---|---|
| Mô tả yêu cầu (chưa có prompt) | **Create** | Chạy Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 |
| Prompt có sẵn cần cải tiến | **Refine** | Chạy checklist Phase 4 trước → xác định điểm yếu → sửa theo kết quả |

### Phase 1: Gather Requirements

Ask the user (one at a time, maximum 4 questions). Skip when answers are obvious from context.

1. **Type**: Detect or ask — what type of prompt?
   - **System prompt**: Persistent AI behavior across a conversation
   - **Task prompt**: One-shot, input → specific output
   - **Conversational prompt**: Multi-turn, requires memory/context handling
   - **Role prompt**: Character/persona, tone-focused

2. **Goal**: "What is the primary goal or role of the system you want to create?"

3. **Output**: "What specific outputs do you expect? (format, length, style)"

4. **Accuracy**: "How should it handle uncertainty? (disclaim, ask for sources, or best-effort)"

Minimize friction — 1-2 questions usually suffice when context is clear.

### Phase 2: Decompose (if needed)

| Tín hiệu | Decompose? |
|---|---|
| Prompt yêu cầu >= 3 expert domains khác nhau | Yes |
| Output cần cả phân tích + sáng tạo + validation | Yes |
| Single domain, straightforward input → output | No — skip to Phase 3 |

Khi decompose, assign expert personas — mỗi expert nhận instructions riêng, không shared memory:

- **Expert Writer** — copywriting, narrative, tone
- **Expert Analyst** — data, logic, verification
- **Expert Python** — code generation, computation
- **Expert [Domain]** — specialized knowledge

"Fresh eyes" — không assign cùng expert cho cả create AND validate.

### Phase 3: Generate the Prompt

Consolidate vào 1 prompt cohesive. Dùng [prompt-template](references/prompt-template.md) — chỉ include sections phù hợp, omit phần không relevant.

Lưu ý khi generate:
- Match prompt structure theo prompt type (system vs task vs conversational vs role)
- Ưu tiên "must NOT" over "should" — negative framing hiệu quả hơn vì giảm ambiguity

### Phase 4: Verify and Deliver

Self-review checklist trước khi deliver:

- [ ] No vague virtue words ("good", "helpful", "detailed") without specific definition
- [ ] No contradictory instructions (e.g., "be concise" + "include all details")
- [ ] No implicit assumptions — all context is explicitly stated
- [ ] Negative constraints are included (what NOT to do)
- [ ] Prompt type matches the use case
- [ ] If complex: suggest splitting into multi-prompt pipeline instead of mega-prompt

Then:
- Present the final prompt, organized and easy to follow
- Note expert reviews if used
- Offer to iterate if user wants adjustments

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

When reviewing or generating prompts, flag these issues:

- **Vague virtues**: "Write a good summary" → "Write a 3-sentence summary focusing on key findings and action items"
- **Overloaded prompt**: Too many tasks in one prompt → suggest splitting
- **Sycophancy traps**: "Always agree" or "Never say no" → remove
- **Missing scope**: "Write marketing copy" without audience, channel, tone → clarify
- **Prompt stuffing**: Repeating the same instruction in multiple sections → deduplicate
