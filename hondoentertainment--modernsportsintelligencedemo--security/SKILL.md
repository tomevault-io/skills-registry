# Security Review & Practices

## When to Use

- User asks for a security review, audit, or best practices
- Adding or changing API keys, auth, or credential handling
- Handling user input, forms, or external data
- Reviewing dependencies or running npm audit
- Deploying or configuring environment variables

---

## Secrets & Credentials

### Never Commit Secrets

- [ ] `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local` in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys, tokens, or passwords in source
- [ ] Use environment variables only; set in Vercel/local `.env`

### Vite/Client-Side Exposure

- Variables with `VITE_` prefix are **bundled into the client** and visible in browser.
- **Safe for client**: Supabase anon key, eBay client ID (public). These are designed for client use.
- **Never use `VITE_` for**: Server secrets, refresh tokens, client secrets, DB credentials. Use a backend/proxy instead.

### Pattern

```ts
// ✅ Correct - env var, no fallback for secrets
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY ?? '';

// ❌ Avoid - hardcoded fallback
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY || 'sk-abc123';
```

---

## Auth & Session

- [ ] Passwords never logged or stored client-side beyond form state
- [ ] Use established auth (Supabase Auth, etc.); avoid custom JWT/session logic
- [ ] Session refresh and token expiry handled by the auth library
- [ ] Password reset links expire; recovery flow uses secure redirects

---

## Input Validation & Injection

### XSS

- React escapes text by default; avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user data
- Sanitize if rendering HTML from external sources

### SQL / Injection

- Use parameterized queries or an ORM; never concatenate user input into SQL
- Supabase client uses parameterized queries

### General

- Validate and sanitize user input before use
- Validate file uploads (type, size) if accepting uploads

---

## Dependency Security

```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix    # Apply safe fixes
```

- [ ] Run before major releases or when adding dependencies
- [ ] Review high/critical findings; avoid `npm audit fix --force` without checking

---

## API & Network

- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] API keys for server-side calls; client-side keys must be public-safe (e.g., anon keys)
- [ ] Rate limiting considered for public endpoints
- [ ] CORS configured restrictively when using a backend

---

## Security Review Checklist

Use when reviewing code for security:

- [ ] No secrets in source or committed config
- [ ] `VITE_` vars only for client-safe values
- [ ] Auth flows use trusted library (Supabase, etc.)
- [ ] User input validated and not used raw in SQL/HTML
- [ ] Dependencies audited (`npm audit`)
- [ ] `.env*` and secrets in `.gitignore`

---

## Severity Levels for Findings

- **Critical**: Fix before merge (e.g., exposed secrets, SQL injection)
- **High**: Fix soon (e.g., XSS, weak auth)
- **Medium**: Plan a fix (e.g., missing validation, outdated deps)
- **Low**: Document or backlog (e.g., hardening suggestions)
