description: Retrieve universal coding patterns from vector database using true two-stage retrieval. Auto-invokes before complex tasks or when user says "--recall". Searches relevant role collections based on task context. Use when this capability is needed.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Use Task Tool (Sub-Agent)

**NEVER call memory MCP tools directly!** Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` to keep main context clean.

---

## CRITICAL: When NOT to Search Memory

**Skip memory search for obvious tasks** - killing processes, starting servers, basic file operations, standard workflows.

**Only search for hard problems** - non-obvious bugs, complex architectures, performance issues, unfamiliar domains.

**Rule**: If basic knowledge suffices, skip memory. Memory is for hard-won lessons.

# Role detection from task context

    quant: "trading|backtest|portfolio|risk|market"

  multi_role_strategy: "search_all"  # When multiple roles detected
  default_role: "universal"          # When no clear role
```
You can create new role if you think it worth it. But be EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE when creating new roles - when you create a new one, add it in this very doc (~/.claude/skills/coder-memory-recall/SKILL.md and ~/.claude/skills/coder-memory-store/SKILL.md).

## PHASE 1: Intelligent Query Construction

**Note**: Claude Code automatically determines relevant roles from task context. No explicit role detection logic needed - Claude is smart enough to select appropriate roles when calling MCP tools.

### Query Building

Build semantic query (2-3 sentences) capturing:
1. What is the problem/goal?
2. What is the technical context?
3. What outcome is desired?

## MCP Server Tools

**CRITICAL**: Use tools from the **memory MCP server**:
- `search_memory` - Search and get previews
- `get_memory` - Get full content by ID
- `batch_get_memories` - Get multiple full contents
- `store_memory` - Store new memory
- `update_memory` - Update existing memory
- `delete_memory` - Delete memory
- `list_collections` - List all collections

## PHASE 2: Two-Stage Retrieval

### Stage 1: Search for Previews (Cast Wide Net)

Use `search_memory` tool (from memory MCP server) with the query and correct memory_level (global, project, etc.), default: `memory_level="global"`. Claude Code determines relevant roles automatically. Default limit is 20 previews.

### Stage 2: Analyze Previews (Intelligence Over Thresholds)

**Analyze each preview**:
- Does title match the problem domain?
- Does description indicate relevant solution?
- Do tags align with task?
- Is memory type appropriate? (episodic for debugging, procedural for workflows, semantic for principles)

**Select 3-5 most relevant** based on your judgement.

### Stage 3: Retrieve Full Content

Use `batch_get_memories` tool (from memory MCP server) with the selected doc_ids and `memory_level="global"`. This retrieves full content for 3-5 most relevant memories.


## PHASE 3: Present Results

Format for Claude to consume:
**Key**: Let Claude read and decide what to use. Don't force-fit patterns.

## Tool Usage

See top of this document - **MUST use Task tool (sub-agent)** to avoid context pollution.
