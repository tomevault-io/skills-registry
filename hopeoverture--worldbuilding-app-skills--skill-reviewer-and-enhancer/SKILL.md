# Skill Reviewer and Enhancer

Review, audit, and enhance existing Claude Code skills to ensure they follow Anthropic best practices and current domain-specific patterns.

## Overview

To improve skill quality and ensure adherence to official standards, this skill performs comprehensive analysis of existing skills, identifies structural issues, verifies domain-specific best practices, and automatically applies improvements.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply this skill when:
- Reviewing an existing skill for quality and compliance
- Auditing skills before deployment to production
- Updating skills to follow latest Anthropic guidelines
- Ensuring skills use current framework/library patterns
- Identifying missing resources or incomplete implementations
- Enhancing skill descriptions for better discoverability
- Fixing structural or formatting issues
- Modernizing outdated skill instructions

## Step 1: Locate and Read the Skill

To begin the review process:

1. Ask user for the skill path or name if not provided
2. Verify the skill directory exists
3. Read the SKILL.md file completely
4. Note the skill's category and purpose

```bash
# Find skill
ls skills/[category]/[skill-name]/SKILL.md

# Read skill
Read: skills/[category]/[skill-name]/SKILL.md
```

## Step 2: Analyze Skill Structure

To verify proper skill structure, check for:

### Frontmatter Validation

**Required Fields:**
- `name`: Must be present, hyphen-case, no angle brackets
- `description`: Must be present, third-person voice, includes trigger terms, under 1024 characters

**Optional Fields:**
- `allowed-tools`: Present for read-only/analysis skills

**Validation Script:**
```bash
python scripts/analyze_skill_structure.py --skill skills/[category]/[skill-name]
```

### Name Convention Check

Verify name follows hyphen-case:
- [OK] Correct: `skill-reviewer-and-enhancer`, `nextjs-fullstack-scaffold`
- [WRONG] Incorrect: `SkillReviewer`, `skill_reviewer`, `skillReviewer`

Check for invalid patterns:
- Starts or ends with hyphen
- Contains consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Contains uppercase letters
- Contains underscores or other special characters

### Description Quality Check

Verify description:
- **Voice**: Uses third-person ("This skill should be used when...")
- **Content**: Explains WHAT it does and WHEN to use it
- **Trigger Terms**: Includes specific keywords users would search for
- **Length**: Under 1024 characters
- **Format**: No angle brackets, proper grammar

## Step 3: Review Instruction Style

To verify proper instruction format, scan the SKILL.md body for:

### Imperative Form Check

Instructions should use imperative/infinitive form:
- [OK] Correct: "To create a form, use the generator script"
- [OK] Correct: "Generate schemas using the Zod validator"
- [WRONG] Incorrect: "You should create forms using the generator"
- [WRONG] Incorrect: "You can generate schemas with Zod"

Use Grep to find second-person usage:
```bash
Grep: pattern="\\b[Yy]ou\\b" path="skills/[category]/[skill-name]/SKILL.md" output_mode="content"
```

Flag any instances for correction.

### Section Structure Check

Verify logical organization:
- Overview/Introduction
- When to Use (optional but recommended)
- Prerequisites (if applicable)
- Step-by-step implementation
- Resource references (scripts, references, assets)
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting (optional)

## Step 4: Verify Domain-Specific Best Practices

## Step 5: Check Resource References

To verify bundled resources are properly referenced:

### Scripts Directory
Check if skill references scripts and whether they exist:
```bash
Grep: pattern="scripts/" path="skills/[category]/[skill-name]/SKILL.md" output_mode="content"
Glob: pattern="skills/[category]/[skill-name]/scripts/*"
```

Verify:
- Scripts mentioned in SKILL.md exist in scripts/ directory
- Scripts have proper documentation
- Scripts are executable (Python/Bash)
- Usage examples are provided

### References Directory
Check if skill references documentation:
```bash
Grep: pattern="references/" path="skills/[category]/[skill-name]/SKILL.md" output_mode="content"
Glob: pattern="skills/[category]/[skill-name]/references/*"
```

Verify:
- References mentioned exist
- Large documents (>5k words) use grep patterns for selective loading
- References are up-to-date with current practices

### Assets Directory
Check if skill references templates or output files:
```bash
Grep: pattern="assets/" path="skills/[category]/[skill-name]/SKILL.md" output_mode="content"
Glob: pattern="skills/[category]/[skill-name]/assets/*"
```

Verify:
- Assets mentioned exist
- Templates are properly formatted
- File names are descriptive

## Step 6: Generate Improvement Report

To create a comprehensive review report, use the template from `assets/review-report-template.md`:

```markdown
# Skill Review Report: [Skill Name]

**Skill Path:** skills/[category]/[skill-name]
**Review Date:** [Date]
**Reviewer:** Claude Code (skill-reviewer-and-enhancer)

## Overall Assessment

**Grade:** [A/B/C/D/F]

- [ ] Fix hyphenation in name
- [ ] Add missing allowed-tools field

**Apply automated fixes?** (Yes/No)
```

## Step 7: Apply Improvements (If Approved)

To apply improvements to the skill, proceed with user approval:

### Automated Fixes

For structural and style issues:

**Fix Second-Person Usage:**
```typescript
// Replace patterns like:
"You should use" → "Use"
"You can generate" → "Generate" or "To generate"
"You need to configure" → "Configure" or "To configure"
"You will see" → "This displays" or "This shows"
"You have to install" → "Install"
```

Use Edit tool to apply changes:
```bash
Edit: file_path="skills/[category]/[skill-name]/SKILL.md"
       old_string="You should use the generator script"
       new_string="Use the generator script"
```

**Fix Frontmatter:**
Add missing fields or correct format:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name-in-hyphen-case
description: Third-person description with trigger terms under 1024 chars.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob  # For read-only skills
---
```

**Fix Name Convention:**
If name uses wrong format, update both frontmatter and directory:
1. Update name in frontmatter
2. Notify user directory rename needed (cannot be done automatically)

### Domain-Specific Updates

For framework/library updates:

**Update Next.js Patterns:**
- Replace `pages/` with `app/` directory examples
- Replace `getServerSideProps` with Server Components
- Replace API routes with Server Actions (where appropriate)
- Update to Next.js 15/16 syntax

**Update Testing Patterns:**
- Replace Jest with Vitest configuration
- Update Testing Library imports
- Use modern assertion syntax
- Add accessibility testing with axe

**Update Database Patterns:**
- Update Prisma to v5 syntax
- Add proper connection pooling
- Use latest Supabase patterns
- Implement RLS examples

**Update Security Patterns:**
- Use latest OWASP recommendations
- Update CSP directives
- Use modern auth patterns (NextAuth v5, Supabase Auth)
- Add secure header configurations

### Resource Creation

For missing resources:

**Create Missing Scripts:**
Use templates from `assets/script-templates/` to generate placeholder scripts:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Script for [skill-name]: [purpose]
"""

def main():
    # Implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Create Missing References:**
Generate reference documents with appropriate content:
```markdown
# [Topic] Best Practices

## Overview
[Introduction to the topic]

## Patterns
[Common patterns and examples]

## Anti-Patterns
[What to avoid]

## Resources
[External references]
```

**Create Missing Assets:**
Generate template files as needed for the skill's purpose.

## Step 8: Validate Enhanced Skill
