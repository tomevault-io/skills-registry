## Multi-Skill Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern: Complete Feature from Scratch

**User request:** "Build a blog post system where users can create and edit posts"

**Analysis:**
- Complete feature needed
- Authentication implied ("users can create")
- Database needed for posts

**Orchestration:**
1. worldcrafter-database-setup (create BlogPost model, RLS policies)
2. worldcrafter-feature-builder (create forms, Server Actions, tests)
3. worldcrafter-auth-guard (add auth checks, protect routes)

**Note:** Feature-builder might call database-setup automatically

### Pattern: Simple Page

**User request:** "Create an about us page"

**Analysis:**
- Simple static page
- No database or forms needed

**Orchestration:**
1. worldcrafter-route-creator only

### Pattern: Protect Existing Feature

**User request:** "Protect the dashboard so only logged-in users can access it"

**Analysis:**
- Dashboard already exists
- Adding auth to existing code

**Orchestration:**
1. worldcrafter-auth-guard only

### Pattern: Database-First Development

**User request:** "Set up database tables for storing blog posts, then I'll build the UI later"

**Analysis:**
- User explicitly wants database first
- UI comes later

**Orchestration:**
1. worldcrafter-database-setup now
2. worldcrafter-feature-builder later (when user is ready for UI)

### Pattern: Improve Test Coverage

**User request:** "The blog feature works but coverage is only 60%"

**Analysis:**
- Feature already exists
- Need to add tests

**Orchestration:**
1. worldcrafter-test-generator only

### Pattern: AI-Assisted World Creation

**User request:** "Generate a fantasy kingdom with AI, then let me visualize it on a map"

**Analysis:**
- AI generation needed first
- Visualization follows
- May need database to store generated data

**Orchestration:**
1. worldcrafter-ai-assistant (generate kingdom data)
2. worldcrafter-database-setup (store generated entities if needed)
3. worldcrafter-visualization (display on map)

### Pattern: Analytics Dashboard

**User request:** "Show me analytics about my world with charts and graphs"

**Analysis:**
- User wants visual analytics
- May need to aggregate data from database
- Visualization is primary goal

**Orchestration:**
1. worldcrafter-visualization (create analytics dashboard)
2. Optional: worldcrafter-database-setup if custom analytics tables needed

### Pattern: Conversational Worldbuilding Setup

**User request:** "Set up ChatGPT so I can build my world conversationally"

**Analysis:**
- MCP server integration needed
- OAuth authentication required
- May want AI assistance features afterward

**Orchestration:**
1. worldcrafter-chatgpt-setup (MCP server, OAuth)
2. Optional: worldcrafter-ai-assistant for prompts/consistency checking

### Pattern: Complete World Visualization

**User request:** "I have character data. Generate relationships with AI and show them in a graph"

**Analysis:**
- Existing data in database
- AI to suggest/expand relationships
- Visualization to display

**Orchestration:**
1. worldcrafter-ai-assistant (suggest relationships)
2. worldcrafter-database-setup (store new relationships if needed)
3. worldcrafter-visualization (relationship graph)

### Pattern: Interactive Timeline with AI Suggestions

**User request:** "Show my world timeline and suggest missing historical events"

**Analysis:**
- Visualization for timeline
- AI for gap analysis and suggestions
- May need database updates

**Orchestration:**
1. worldcrafter-visualization (display existing timeline)
2. worldcrafter-ai-assistant (analyze gaps, suggest events)
3. Optional: worldcrafter-database-setup (add suggested events)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Using Route-Creator for Forms

```
❌ Wrong:
User: "Create a contact form"
Claude: Uses route-creator

✅ Correct:
User: "Create a contact form"
Claude: Uses feature-builder (forms need validation)
```

### Mistake 2: Using Feature-Builder for Static Pages

```
❌ Wrong:
User: "Add an about page"
Claude: Uses feature-builder (over-engineering)

✅ Correct:
User: "Add an about page"
Claude: Uses route-creator (simple page)
```

### Mistake 3: Using Test-Generator After Feature-Builder

```
❌ Wrong:
User: "Build a blog feature"
Claude: Uses feature-builder, then test-generator

✅ Correct:
User: "Build a blog feature"
Claude: Uses feature-builder only (already includes tests)

Only use test-generator if user requests additional coverage
```

### Mistake 4: Not Using Database-Setup First

```
❌ Wrong:
User: "Build a blog feature"
Claude: Uses feature-builder, realizes database is needed, goes back

✅ Correct:
User: "Build a blog feature"
Claude: Uses database-setup first, then feature-builder
```

### Mistake 5: Using AI-Assistant for Manual Creation

```
❌ Wrong:
User: "Create a character named John"
Claude: Uses ai-assistant (user wants manual creation)

✅ Correct:
User: "Create a character named John"
Claude: Uses feature-builder or database-setup (manual input)

User: "Generate character ideas with AI"
Claude: Uses ai-assistant (AI generation)
```

### Mistake 6: Using Visualization for Static Display

```
❌ Wrong:
User: "Show me a list of my characters"
Claude: Uses visualization (over-engineering)

✅ Correct:
User: "Show me a list of my characters"
Claude: Uses route-creator (simple list page)

User: "Show character relationships in a graph"
Claude: Uses visualization (actual visualization needed)
```

### Mistake 7: Using Feature-Builder for MCP Setup

```
❌ Wrong:
User: "Set up ChatGPT integration"
Claude: Uses feature-builder (builds chat UI instead of MCP)

✅ Correct:
User: "Set up ChatGPT integration"
Claude: Uses chatgpt-setup (MCP server configuration)
```

## Clarifying Questions

When user intent is unclear, ask these questions:

**For "Add a [X] page":**
- "Do you need a form on this page, or just static content?"
- If form → feature-builder
- If static → route-creator

**For "Create a [X]":**
- "Do you want the complete feature with forms and validation, or just the database table?"
- If complete → feature-builder
- If database only → database-setup

**For "Set up [X]":**
- "Do you want to set up the database, the UI, or both?"
- Database only → database-setup
- UI only → route-creator or feature-builder
- Both → database-setup then feature-builder

**For "Add authentication":**
- "Are you adding auth to existing features, or building new auth flows?"
- Existing features → auth-guard
- New flows → feature-builder with auth

**For "Generate [X]":**
- "Do you want AI-assisted generation, or manual creation with forms?"
- AI-assisted → ai-assistant
- Manual creation → feature-builder or database-setup

**For "Show [X]":**
- "Do you need a visualization (map/timeline/graph), or a simple list/display?"
- Visualization → visualization
- Simple display → route-creator

**For "Set up ChatGPT" or "conversational":**
- "Do you want ChatGPT/MCP integration, or a chat UI feature in your app?"
- MCP integration → chatgpt-setup
- Chat UI feature → feature-builder

**For "Timeline" or "Map":**
- "Do you need to visualize existing data, or create the timeline/map data first?"
- Visualize existing → visualization
- Create data first → database-setup, then visualization

**For "Suggest" or "Ideas":**
- "Do you want AI suggestions, or just a form to manually add ideas?"
- AI suggestions → ai-assistant
- Manual form → feature-builder
