Provide a code review for the given local changeset.

Use this skill after `.agents/skills/codereview/SKILL.md` routes the task
here. Read `../references/triggering-and-signal.md` first. When composing the
final report, also read `../references/report-composition.md`.

If the user explicitly asks for architecture review in addition to local
changeset review, if an upstream `prmr-codereview` workflow forwards that
requirement, or if the reviewed scope materially changes layering, ownership
boundaries, dependency direction, compatibility/public surfaces, or other
architecture-review dimensions, launch `../architecture-review/SKILL.md` as a
paired review against the same reviewed scope. Keep this skill as the main
report owner and summarize the paired architecture result in `Related review
inputs`.
Use `../architecture-review/SKILL.md` by itself only when architecture is the
sole requested review dimension.

**Agent assumptions (applies to all agents and subagents):**
- All tools are functional and will work without error. Do not test tools or
  make exploratory calls. Make sure this is clear to every subagent that is
  launched.
- Only call a tool if it is required to complete the task. Every tool call
  should have a clear purpose.
- Choose subagents by capability tier rather than vendor-specific model
  names: use a lightweight reviewer for scope discovery or file lists, a
  general reviewer for balanced summaries or guidance checks, and the
  strongest available reviewer for bug finding or issue validation.
- Reviewer and validator subagents should try to exhaust the reviewed scope
  for high-signal issues. Do not stop after the first good finding or
  intentionally cap the response to only the top 1-2 issues.
- This workflow requires subagents. Do not silently collapse it into a
  single-agent review. If delegation is unavailable or not yet authorized,
  stop and ask for explicit delegation permission before proceeding.
- Keep the review fan-out bounded. Close completed discovery, reviewer, and
  validator agents as soon as their outputs have been incorporated instead of
  leaving earlier review waves idle while later phases run.
- The numbered reviewer counts in this workflow are mandatory minima. Do not
  silently launch fewer subagents, merge distinct reviewer roles into one
  agent, or skip the validation stage.

To do this, follow these steps precisely:

1. Determine the reviewed changeset.
   - Identify whether the target is a commit, branch diff, staged diff,
     working tree diff, patch, or explicit file set.
   - Choose the smallest reasonable diff or file scope that satisfies the
     request.
   - If this is a re-review of an updated target, default to the full current
     effective changeset rather than only the incremental patch since the last
     review, unless the user explicitly asks for incremental-only validation.
   - If prior findings or user-specified concerns exist, keep a working ledger
     and classify each item against the current scope as fixed, unresolved, or
     no longer applicable.
   - If the target is ambiguous, make a reasonable local choice and state it
     in the report metadata.

2. If the user or upstream review context explicitly requested
   architecture review in addition to this changeset review, or if the
   reviewed scope materially changes layering, ownership boundaries,
   dependency direction, compatibility/public surfaces, or other
   architecture-review dimensions, launch a paired
   `architecture-review` subagent against the same reviewed scope before
   continuing. Keep its output as a separate paired-review input for the
   final report.

3. Launch a lightweight review subagent to return a list of file paths (not
   their contents) for all relevant repository guidance files including:
   - The root `AGENTS.md` file, if it exists
   - Any directory-scoped `AGENTS.md` files that apply to modified files
   - Any files under `.agents/instructions/`, `.agents/references/`, or
     `.agents/skills/` referenced by those `AGENTS.md` files and relevant to
     the review scope
   Close this discovery agent once the applicable guidance file list has been
   captured.

4. Summarize the reviewed changeset locally before issue discovery. Do not
   keep a dedicated summary agent open for this step.

5. Launch 3 agents in parallel to independently review the changes. Each
   agent should return the list of issues, where each issue includes a
   description and the reason it was flagged.
   Each reviewer must return every high-signal issue it can find in scope, not
   only the single strongest issue.

   Agent 1: repository guidance compliance reviewer
   Audit changes for `AGENTS.md` / `.agents` guidance compliance.
   When evaluating guidance compliance for a file, only consider the guidance
   files that are in scope for that file, including applicable parent
   `AGENTS.md` files and the `.agents` instruction/reference/skill files
   they reference.

   Agent 2: deep bug reviewer
   Scan for obvious bugs. Focus only on the reviewed changeset. Flag only
   significant bugs; ignore nitpicks and likely false positives.

   Agent 3: deep bug reviewer
   Look for problems introduced by the reviewed changeset. This could be
   security issues, incorrect logic, or clear contract breakage.

   **CRITICAL: We only want HIGH SIGNAL issues.** Flag issues where:
   - The code will fail to compile or parse
   - The code will definitely produce wrong results regardless of inputs
   - Clear, unambiguous repository guidance violations where you can quote
     the exact rule being broken
   Close these reviewer agents once the candidate-issue set has been
   consolidated for validation.

6. Validate the issues in small batches. Keep at most 2 validator agents open
   at once: one general validator for repository guidance issues and one
   strongest-available validator for bugs and logic issues. The validator's
   job is to confirm that the issue is truly real with high confidence in the
   reviewed scope. For repository guidance issues, validate that the cited
   `AGENTS.md` / `.agents` rule is actually in scope and actually violated.
   Reuse or relaunch validators as needed, but close each validator as soon
   as its assigned validations have been incorporated.

7. Filter out any issues that were not validated. De-duplicate overlapping
   issues across all reviewers, then assign a final severity to each
   remaining issue.
   Before moving on, run a convergence pass against the reviewer outputs,
   validator outputs, and any prior-findings ledger. If a new validated issue
   surfaces during write-up, fold it into this round instead of leaving it for
   a later follow-up review.

8. Output a summary using `REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`.
   - If this workflow used any paired review skill, include a short
     `Related review inputs` summary for each paired skill. Keep those
     summaries concise and reference the paired report instead of copying its
     findings into the main findings sections.
   - If no issues were found, use the exact text:
     `No issues found. Checked for bugs and scoped guidance compliance.`
   - If issues were found, include only validated, de-duplicated
     high-signal findings.
