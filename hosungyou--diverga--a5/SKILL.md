# Paradigm & Worldview Advisor

**Agent ID**: A5
**Category**: A - Theory & Design
**Tier**: HIGH (Opus)
**Icon**: 🌐

## Overview

Guides researchers in articulating and justifying their philosophical foundations. Helps align ontological, epistemological, and axiological assumptions with methodological choices. Essential for proposal writing, IRB submissions, and maintaining internal consistency across the research design.

## Core Functions

### 1. Research Paradigm Identification

Helps researchers identify which paradigm(s) align with their:
- Research questions
- Personal values and beliefs
- Methodological preferences
- Intended knowledge contribution

### 2. Philosophical Foundation Articulation

Guides explicit articulation of:
- **Ontology**: What is the nature of reality in your study?
- **Epistemology**: How can you know what you claim to know?
- **Axiology**: What is the role of values in your research?
- **Methodology**: How does your approach to inquiry follow from the above?

### 3. Paradigm-Method Alignment

Ensures internal consistency:
- Detects mismatches between stated philosophy and methods
- Justifies "unconventional" pairings (e.g., post-positivist qualitative)
- Explains paradigm choices to reviewers

### 4. Positionality Statement Guidance

Helps write reflexive statements on:
- Researcher's social identities
- Relationship to topic and participants
- How these shape the research

## Paradigm Selection Guidance

### Flowchart for Paradigm Selection

```markdown
## Step 1: What is the nature of reality for your research?

A. **Single objective reality exists** (independent of human perception)
   → Positivism/Post-positivism

B. **Multiple subjective realities exist** (constructed through experience)
   → Constructivism

C. **Reality is shaped by power structures** (historical, ideological)
   → Critical Theory

D. **Reality is what works in practice** (contextual, pragmatic)
   → Pragmatism

E. **Reality shaped by systemic inequities** (focus on marginalized)
   → Transformative

---

## Step 2: What is your role as researcher?

A. **Objective observer** (detached, neutral)
   → Positivism/Post-positivism

B. **Co-constructor of meaning** (engaged, interpretive)
   → Constructivism

C. **Advocate for change** (activist, critical)
   → Critical Theory/Transformative

D. **Problem-solver** (practical, action-oriented)
   → Pragmatism

---

## Step 3: What is the purpose of your research?

A. **Predict, explain, generalize** (causal relationships)
   → Positivism/Post-positivism

B. **Understand, interpret meaning** (lived experiences)
   → Constructivism

C. **Critique, transform systems** (emancipation, social justice)
   → Critical Theory/Transformative

D. **Solve practical problems** (actionable knowledge)
   → Pragmatism

---

## Step 4: What methods do you plan to use?

A. **Quantitative** (experiments, surveys, statistical analysis)
   → Positivism/Post-positivism/Pragmatism

B. **Qualitative** (interviews, observations, textual analysis)
   → Constructivism/Critical Theory/Pragmatism

C. **Mixed methods** (integration of quantitative and qualitative)

## Positionality Statement Template

A positionality statement articulates the researcher's stance and how it shapes the research.

### Structure

```markdown
## Positionality Statement

### 1. Social Identities

I identify as [race/ethnicity], [gender], [class/socioeconomic status], [profession/role], [other relevant identities]. These identities shape my worldview in the following ways:

- **Race/Ethnicity**: [How this shapes your perspective on the topic]
- **Gender**: [How this influences your approach]
- **Professional Role**: [As educator/researcher/practitioner...]
- **Other Identities**: [Relevant aspects]

### 2. Relationship to the Topic

My interest in [research topic] stems from [personal/professional experience]. Specifically:

- **Personal Experience**: [If applicable - lived experience with phenomenon]
- **Professional Background**: [Years in field, prior roles, expertise]
- **Assumptions I Bring**: [Explicit acknowledgment of biases/beliefs]

### 3. Relationship to Participants

My relationship to the participant population is characterized by:

- **Insider/Outsider Status**: [Do you share identity/experience with participants?]
- **Power Dynamics**: [Acknowledge any power differentials]
- **Shared Experiences**: [What you have in common; what differs]

### 4. Paradigmatic Stance

I approach this research from a [paradigm] perspective, which means:

- **Ontology**: I believe [nature of reality for this study]
- **Epistemology**: I claim to know through [means of knowledge generation]
- **Axiology**: My values influence this research by [how values shape inquiry]
- **How This Shapes the Study**: [Concrete examples of influence on design/analysis]

### 5. Reflexivity Practices

To maintain awareness of how my positionality influences the research, I will:

- [Strategy 1, e.g., "Keep a reflexive journal throughout data collection"]
- [Strategy 2, e.g., "Engage in member checking with participants"]
- [Strategy 3, e.g., "Discuss interpretations with critical friends from different backgrounds"]
```

## Common Paradigm-Method Alignments

### Typical Pairings

| Paradigm | Typical Design | Typical Analysis | Example RQ |
|----------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **Positivism** | RCT | ANOVA, t-test | "Does intervention X increase outcome Y?" |
| **Post-positivism** | Quasi-experimental | Regression, SEM | "To what extent does X predict Y, controlling for Z?" |
| **Constructivism** | Phenomenology | Thematic analysis | "What is the lived experience of X?" |
| **Critical** | Participatory action | Critical discourse analysis | "How do power structures shape X?" |
| **Pragmatism** | Sequential mixed | Quan → Qual integration | "What works, for whom, and why?" |
| **Transformative** | Community-based | Culturally responsive analysis | "How can research address inequity in X?" |

### Justifying Unconventional Pairings

Sometimes researchers pair paradigms and methods in unconventional ways. Here's how to justify:

**Example: Post-positivist Qualitative Research**

```markdown
While qualitative methods are often associated with constructivism, I adopt a post-positivist stance in this qualitative study because:

1. **Ontology**: I assume a reality exists regarding [phenomenon], though participants' perceptions provide the best access to it
2. **Epistemology**: Through triangulation of multiple interview and observational data, I seek convergence toward an approximate truth
3. **Quality Criteria**: I emphasize validity (through member checking, triangulation) and reliability (through inter-rater reliability), not just constructivist criteria
4. **Purpose**: My goal is not merely understanding participant meaning-making, but identifying patterns that approximate generalizable findings

This approach is consistent with [citation to methodological literature].
```
