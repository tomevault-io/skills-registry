## VS Arena Check (v11.1)

Before proceeding with internal VS, check if VS Arena is enabled:
1. Read `config/diverga-config.json` → `vs_arena.enabled`
2. If `true` → delegate to `/diverga:vs-arena` instead of internal VS process
3. If `false` or config unavailable → proceed with internal VS below

## ⛔ Prerequisites (v8.2 — MCP Enforcement)

`diverga_check_prerequisites("c3")` → must return `approved: true`
If not approved → AskUserQuestion for each missing checkpoint (see `.claude/references/checkpoint-templates.md`)

### Checkpoints During Execution
- 🔴 CP_METHODOLOGY_APPROVAL → `diverga_mark_checkpoint("CP_METHODOLOGY_APPROVAL", decision, rationale)`
- 🟠 CP_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY → `diverga_mark_checkpoint("CP_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY", decision, rationale)`

### Fallback (MCP unavailable)
Read `.research/decision-log.yaml` directly to verify prerequisites. Conversation history is last resort.

---

## Mixed Methods Design Types

### 1. Sequential Explanatory Design

**Morse Notation**: `QUAN → qual`

**Structure**:
```
Phase 1 (Priority):     QUANTITATIVE DATA COLLECTION & ANALYSIS
                                    ↓
Phase 2 (Follow-up):    qualitative data collection & analysis
                                    ↓
Integration:            qual explains quan results
```

**Priority**: Quantitative (UPPERCASE)

**Timing**: Sequential (→)

**Integration Point**: Connecting - qualitative phase explains quantitative results

**When to Use**:
- Need to explain unexpected quantitative findings
- Want to explore significant or non-significant results
- Require deeper understanding of statistical patterns
- Follow up with extreme cases or outliers

**Example Studies**:
- Survey shows unexpected correlation → Interviews explain mechanism
- Experimental result needs clarification → Case studies provide context
- Quantitative patterns need interpretation → Focus groups elaborate

**Design Workflow**:
1. Conduct quantitative phase (survey, experiment, etc.)
2. Analyze quantitative data (statistics)
3. Identify areas needing explanation (outliers, unexpected results)
4. Design qualitative phase (select participants based on quan results)
5. Collect qualitative data (interviews, observations)
6. Analyze qualitative data (thematic analysis)
7. Integrate: How does qual explain quan?

---

### 2. Sequential Exploratory Design

**Morse Notation**: `QUAL → quan`

**Structure**:
```
Phase 1 (Priority):     QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION & ANALYSIS
                                    ↓
Phase 2 (Follow-up):    quantitative data collection & analysis
                                    ↓
Integration:            QUAL develops quan instrument or tests theory
```

**Priority**: Qualitative (UPPERCASE)

**Timing**: Sequential (→)

**Integration Point**: Connecting - qualitative findings inform quantitative instrument development

**When to Use**:
- No validated instrument exists for your context
- Need to develop culturally appropriate measures
- Explore new phenomenon before measurement
- Test emergent theory with larger sample

**Example Studies**:
- Interviews identify new constructs → Develop survey items → Validate scale
- Grounded theory emerges → Create measurement tool → Test with sample
- Cultural adaptation needed → Qualitative exploration → Quantitative validation

**Design Workflow**:
1. Conduct qualitative phase (interviews, focus groups)
2. Analyze qualitative data (coding, thematic analysis)
3. Identify themes/constructs for measurement
4. Develop quantitative instrument (survey items, scales)
5. Pilot test instrument (cognitive interviews)
6. Collect quantitative data (administer survey)
7. Analyze quantitative data (psychometrics, statistics)
8. Integrate: Did quan confirm QUAL findings?

---

### 3. Convergent Parallel Design

**Morse Notation**: `QUAN + QUAL`

**Structure**:
```
Phase 1a:    QUANTITATIVE DATA → QUAN ANALYSIS
                        |                |
Phase 1b:    QUALITATIVE DATA  → QUAL ANALYSIS
                                         ↓
Integration:        MERGE & COMPARE RESULTS
```

**Priority**: Equal (both UPPERCASE)

**Timing**: Concurrent (+)

**Integration Point**: Merging - compare, contrast, and synthesize

**When to Use**:
- Need comprehensive understanding from different angles
- Want to triangulate findings (validate results)
- Seek to address different aspects of same phenomenon
- Have resources for concurrent data collection

**Example Studies**:
- Survey + interviews collected simultaneously on same topic
- Experimental data + participant reflections
- Organizational metrics + employee experiences

**Design Workflow**:
1. Design both phases simultaneously (ensure complementarity)
2. Collect quantitative data (surveys, experiments)
3. Collect qualitative data (interviews, observations) - at same time
4. Analyze quantitative data (statistics)
5. Analyze qualitative data (thematic analysis)
6. Integrate: Where do results converge? Diverge? Expand?
7. Meta-inferences: What do combined results tell us?

**Integration Strategies**:
- **Convergence**: Do results agree?
- **Divergence**: Do results contradict? (explore why)
- **Expansion**: Do results complement each other?
- **Transformation**: Convert one type into other (quantitize or qualitize)

---

### 4. Embedded Design

**Morse Notation**: `QUAN(qual)` or `QUAL(quan)`

**Structure for QUAN(qual)**:
```
Primary Strand:     QUANTITATIVE DESIGN (e.g., RCT)
                            ↓
Embedded Strand:    (qualitative component addresses different question)
                            ↓
Integration:        qual informs or evaluates QUAN process
```

**Priority**: Primary strand (UPPERCASE), embedded strand (lowercase)

**Timing**: Can be concurrent or sequential

**Integration Point**: Embedding - secondary strand supports primary

**When to Use**:
- Primary study underway, need supplementary data
- Want to understand process within outcome study
- Evaluate implementation within efficacy trial
- Assess participant experiences within quantitative design

**Example Studies**:
- **QUAN(qual)**: RCT with embedded qualitative process evaluation
- **QUAL(quan)**: Ethnography with embedded survey of participants
- **QUAN(qual)**: Longitudinal survey with embedded case studies

**Design Workflow (for QUAN(qual))**:
1. Design primary quantitative study (RCT, survey)
2. Identify need for embedded qualitative component (process evaluation)
3. Design qualitative component (interviews during intervention)
4. Collect QUANTITATIVE data (main study)
5. Collect qualitative data (embedded - different question)
6. Analyze both datasets separately
7. Integrate: How does qual explain QUAN implementation/outcomes?

---

### 5. Multiphase Design

**Morse Notation**: Multiple phases, each with own notation

**Structure**:
```
Phase 1:    QUAL (needs assessment)
                ↓
Phase 2:    QUAL → quan (intervention development)
                ↓
Phase 3:    QUAN(qual) (efficacy trial with process evaluation)
                ↓
Phase 4:    QUAN + QUAL (implementation study)
```

**Priority**: Varies by phase

**Timing**: Mixed (sequential between phases, can be concurrent within)

**When to Use**:
- Large-scale, multi-year projects
- Program evaluation with multiple objectives
- Intervention development and testing
- Community-based participatory research

**Example Studies**:
- NIH-funded intervention development → testing → implementation
- Program evaluation over multiple years
- Mixed methods action research cycles

## Design Selection Flowchart

### Step 1: Identify Primary Purpose

**Q1**: What is your primary research purpose?

| Purpose | Recommended Design | Next Step |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Explain quantitative results | Sequential Explanatory (QUAN → qual) | Plan quantitative phase first |
| Develop/test instrument | Sequential Exploratory (QUAL → quan) | Plan qualitative phase first |
| Comprehensive understanding | Convergent Parallel (QUAN + QUAL) | Plan both phases simultaneously |
| Answer different questions | Embedded (QUAN(qual) or QUAL(quan)) | Identify primary strand |
| Long-term, multi-objective | Multiphase | Plan iteratively, phase by phase |

### Step 2: Determine Priority

**Q2**: Which method addresses your PRIMARY research question?

- **Quantitative priority**: Use UPPERCASE for QUAN
- **Qualitative priority**: Use UPPERCASE for QUAL
- **Equal priority**: Use UPPERCASE for both

### Step 3: Consider Timing

**Q3**: Can you collect data concurrently or must it be sequential?

- **Concurrent (+)**: Collect both types at same time (resource-intensive)
- **Sequential (→)**: One phase informs the next (time-intensive)

### Step 4: Plan Integration

**Q4**: How will you integrate the two datasets?

| Integration Method | When to Use |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Connecting** | Sequential designs (one phase builds on previous) |
| **Merging** | Convergent designs (compare/contrast results) |
| **Embedding** | Embedded designs (secondary supports primary) |
| **Transforming** | Convert qualitative to quantitative or vice versa |

---

## Morse Notation Guide

### Priority Indicators

| Notation | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **UPPERCASE** | Dominant/primary strand | **QUAN** → qual (quan drives study) |
| **lowercase** | Secondary/supplementary | QUAN → **qual** (qual is follow-up) |
| **Both UPPERCASE** | Equal priority | **QUAN + QUAL** (both equally important) |

### Timing Indicators

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **→** | Sequential (phases in order) | QUAN **→** qual |
| **+** | Concurrent (at same time) | QUAN **+** QUAL |
| **()** | Embedded (inside another) | QUAN**(qual)** |

### Common Morse Notations

```yaml
QUAN → qual:
  Name: "Sequential Explanatory"
  Priority: "Quantitative"
  Timing: "Sequential"

QUAL → quan:
  Name: "Sequential Exploratory"
  Priority: "Qualitative"
  Timing: "Sequential"

QUAN + QUAL:
  Name: "Convergent Parallel"
  Priority: "Equal"
  Timing: "Concurrent"

QUAN(qual):
  Name: "Embedded - Quantitative Priority"
  Priority: "Quantitative (qualitative embedded)"
  Timing: "Concurrent or sequential"

QUAL(quan):
  Name: "Embedded - Qualitative Priority"
  Priority: "Qualitative (quantitative embedded)"
  Timing: "Concurrent or sequential"

QUAL → QUAN:
  Name: "Sequential Exploratory - Equal Priority"
  Priority: "Equal (both UPPERCASE)"
  Timing: "Sequential"
```

## Integration Strategies

### 1. Connecting (Sequential Designs)

**How**: Results from Phase 1 inform design/sampling of Phase 2

**Example**:
- Quantitative survey identifies extreme cases → Select for qualitative interviews
- Qualitative interviews reveal themes → Create survey items to test

**Integration Questions**:
- How do Phase 2 results explain Phase 1 findings?
- Did Phase 1 results guide Phase 2 design appropriately?

---

### 2. Merging (Convergent Designs)

**How**: Analyze datasets separately, then compare/contrast

**Techniques**:
- **Side-by-side comparison**: Present quan and qual results in table/matrix
- **Data transformation**: Convert qualitative themes to counts (quantitizing)
- **Joint display**: Visual representation showing convergence/divergence

**Example Joint Display**:

| Theme (QUAL) | Supporting Quote | Frequency (quan) | Statistical Relationship |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Self-efficacy | "I feel confident now" | 85% (n=170) | r = .45, p < .001 with outcomes |

**Integration Questions**:
- Where do results **converge** (agree)?
- Where do results **diverge** (contradict)?
- How do results **expand** understanding?

---

### 3. Embedding (Embedded Designs)

**How**: Secondary strand addresses different question within primary design

**Example (RCT with embedded qual)**:
- **Primary (QUAN)**: Does intervention improve outcomes? (pre/post test)
- **Embedded (qual)**: How do participants experience the intervention? (interviews)

**Integration Questions**:
- How does embedded strand inform implementation of primary?
- Did embedded findings reveal issues with primary design?

---

### 4. Transforming

**Quantitizing** (QUAL → quan):
- Convert qualitative themes to numeric codes
- Count frequency of codes
- Create variables for statistical analysis

**Qualitizing** (QUAN → qual):
- Convert quantitative results to narrative profiles
- Create case summaries from statistical clusters
- Use statistical results as qualitative themes

---

## Example Consultation

**User Input**:
"I want to study how teachers adopt AI tools in classrooms. I'm thinking of surveying 200 teachers first, then interviewing some of them to understand their experiences. Is this a good mixed methods design?"

**Agent C3 Response**:

```markdown
# Mixed Methods Design Consultation: Teacher AI Adoption Study

## Analysis of Your Proposed Design

Your proposed approach follows a **Sequential Explanatory Design (QUAN → qual)**.

**Morse Notation**: QUAN → qual

**Strengths**:
✅ Quantitative priority with qualitative follow-up
✅ Clear sequence: survey → interviews
✅ Practical sampling: nested (interviewees from survey respondents)

**Design Fit**: This is appropriate for:
- Explaining patterns found in survey data
- Understanding "why" behind adoption rates
- Exploring unexpected findings from quantitative phase

## Recommended Design Structure

### Phase 1: QUANTITATIVE (Priority)

**Purpose**: Measure AI adoption rates, identify patterns, and select interview participants

**Method**: Online survey

**Sample**:
- n = 200 teachers (stratified by subject, grade level, school type)
- Sampling: Recruit via teacher networks, school districts

**Instrument**: Teacher AI Adoption Survey
- Demographics
- AI tool usage frequency (Likert scales)
- Perceived usefulness (TAM constructs)
- Barriers to adoption (checklist + open-ended)

**Analysis**:
- Descriptive statistics (adoption rates)
- Correlation analysis (factors predicting adoption)
- Cluster analysis (identify adopter profiles: high/medium/low)

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks (design, pilot, distribute, analyze)

### Phase 2: qualitative (Follow-up)

**Purpose**: Explain quantitative patterns with in-depth teacher narratives

**Method**: Semi-structured interviews

**Sample**:
- n = 24-30 teachers (purposive sampling from Phase 1)
- Selection criteria:
  - 8-10 high adopters (understand facilitators)
  - 8-10 moderate adopters (understand barriers/facilitators mix)
  - 8-10 low adopters (understand barriers)
  - Ensure diversity in subject, grade, school context

**Data Collection**:
- 45-60 minute Zoom interviews
- Questions informed by Phase 1 findings:
  - "Your survey indicated [pattern]. Can you describe your experience?"
  - "What factors influenced your decision to [adopt/not adopt]?"
  - Specific probes about barriers/facilitators from survey

**Analysis**:
- Thematic analysis (deductive + inductive coding)
- Cross-case comparison by adopter profile

**Timeline**: 8-10 weeks (recruit, interview, transcribe, analyze)

## Integration Plan

**Integration Point**: Connecting (qual explains quan)

**Integration Procedure**:
1. **During qual design**: Use quan results to develop interview protocol
   - Identify unexpected findings needing explanation
   - Select diverse participants across adopter profiles

2. **During qual analysis**: Code with awareness of quan patterns
   - Look for themes explaining statistical relationships
   - Identify mechanisms behind survey correlations

3. **During interpretation**: Create joint display

**Example Joint Display**:

| Adopter Profile (QUAN) | n (%) | Mean Usage Score | Key Barriers (QUAN) | Qualitative Themes (qual) |
|-------------------------|-------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| High Adopters | 45 (22.5%) | 4.2/5 | Lack of training | "I taught myself through YouTube" (self-efficacy) |
| Moderate Adopters | 98 (49%) | 2.8/5 | Time constraints | "I want to, but grading takes priority" (competing demands) |
| Low Adopters | 57 (28.5%) | 1.1/5 | Fear of replacement | "I worry AI will make me obsolete" (job security anxiety) |

**Meta-Inferences**:
- Quantitative: 22.5% high adoption rate, training is barrier
- Qualitative: High adopters bypass training through self-directed learning (resourcefulness)
- **Integrated Insight**: Training programs may be less important than fostering teacher self-efficacy for independent learning

## Quality Assurance

### Quantitative Rigor
- [ ] Survey pilot tested with 20 teachers (cognitive interviews)
- [ ] Validated scales used (TAM, UTAUT)
- [ ] Sufficient sample size for correlation analysis (n=200)

### Qualitative Rigor
- [ ] Purposive sampling ensures theoretical saturation
- [ ] Member checking with 5 participants
- [ ] Intercoder reliability ≥ 80% on 20% of transcripts

### Mixed Methods Legitimation
- [ ] **Weakness minimization**: Survey measures prevalence (quan strength), interviews explain why (qual strength)
- [ ] **Sequential validity**: Phase 1 results directly inform Phase 2 participant selection and interview questions
- [ ] **Integration validity**: Joint display allows direct comparison of quan patterns and qual themes

## Timeline & Resources

| Phase | Duration | Resources Needed |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Phase 1 (QUAN) | 6-8 weeks | Survey platform ($), research assistant for recruitment |
| Phase 2 (qual) | 8-10 weeks | Zoom ($), transcription service ($), NVivo license ($) |
| Integration & Writing | 4-6 weeks | Time for synthesis |
| **Total** | **18-24 weeks** | **~$2,000-3,000 budget estimate** |

## Recommendations

1. **Add to Phase 1**: Include open-ended question at end of survey:
   - "Is there anything else about your AI adoption experience you'd like to share?"
   - This provides preliminary qualitative data to inform interview protocol

2. **Consider Participant Incentives**:
   - Survey: Entry into raffle for 5x $50 Amazon gift cards
   - Interviews: $30 gift card per participant

3. **Plan for Attrition**:
   - Recruit 10-15% more survey participants than needed
   - At survey end, ask: "Would you be willing to be contacted for a follow-up interview?"
   - Send interview invitations immediately after Phase 1 analysis (while still engaged)

## ⚠️ Human Checkpoint Required

**CP_METHODOLOGY_APPROVAL**

Please review this design and confirm:
- [ ] Does QUAN → qual design fit your research questions?
- [ ] Is timeline feasible for your project?
- [ ] Do you have resources for both phases?
- [ ] Any concerns about sampling or integration plan?

Once approved, I can help you:
1. Develop survey instrument
2. Create interview protocol
3. Plan analysis procedures
```
