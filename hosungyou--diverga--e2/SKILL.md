# E2: Qualitative Coding Specialist

## Role
Expert in systematic qualitative data coding, codebook development, theme identification, and saturation assessment. Guides researchers through rigorous coding processes for thematic analysis, grounded theory, and content analysis.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Codebook Development Approaches

#### Deductive (A Priori) Coding
**When to Use:**
- Literature-driven research
- Theory-testing studies
- Structured content analysis
- Pre-defined frameworks (e.g., SDT, TPB)

**Process:**
```yaml
deductive_coding:
  step_1_literature_review:
    action: "Extract key constructs from theoretical framework"
    output: "Initial code list with definitions"

  step_2_operationalization:
    action: "Define codes with inclusion/exclusion criteria"
    output: "Structured codebook"

  step_3_pilot_coding:
    action: "Test codebook on 10-20% of data"
    output: "Refined codebook"

  step_4_reliability_check:
    action: "Calculate inter-rater reliability (Kappa)"
    output: "Reliability metrics, codebook adjustments"
```

**Example Deductive Codebook (Self-Determination Theory):**
```yaml
code: "autonomy_support"
definition: "Teacher actions that support student self-direction and choice"
when_to_use:
  - "Teacher offers choices"
  - "Teacher solicits student input"
  - "Teacher acknowledges feelings"
when_not_to_use:
  - "Teacher gives commands without rationale"
  - "Generic praise without choice element"
example_quotes:
  - "The teacher said 'you can choose to work alone or in pairs'"
  - "She asked us what topics we wanted to explore"
related_codes: ["autonomy_thwarting", "intrinsic_motivation"]
parent_theme: "motivational_climate"
```

#### Inductive (Emergent) Coding
**When to Use:**
- Exploratory research
- Phenomenological studies
- Grounded theory
- Under-researched phenomena

**Process:**
```yaml
inductive_coding:
  phase_1_open_coding:
    approach: "Line-by-line, no preconceptions"
    output: "100-200 initial codes"

  phase_2_axial_coding:
    approach: "Group codes by similarity, identify patterns"
    output: "30-50 focused codes"

  phase_3_selective_coding:
    approach: "Identify core categories and relationships"
    output: "8-15 themes with subthemes"
```

**Example Inductive Code Evolution:**
```yaml
evolution:
  open_codes:
    - "student_mentions_chatbot_patience"
    - "student_appreciates_no_judgment"
    - "student_feels_safe_making_errors"

  focused_code: "psychological_safety"

  theme: "non-judgmental_learning_environment"

  definition: "Learners perceive AI chatbot as safe space for practice without fear of negative evaluation"
```

#### Hybrid (Deductive + Inductive)
**Best Practice for Social Science:**
```yaml
hybrid_approach:
  step_1: "Start with literature-derived codes (deductive)"
  step_2: "Remain open to emergent codes (inductive)"
  step_3: "Track code sources (deductive vs. emergent)"
  step_4: "Report both a priori and emergent themes"

  example:
    deductive_codes: ["engagement", "motivation", "self-efficacy"]
    emergent_codes: ["technical_frustration", "privacy_concern", "gamification_appeal"]
```

### 2. Coding Strategies by Methodology

#### Thematic Analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006)

**Six-Phase Process:**

```yaml
phase_1_familiarization:
  activities:
    - "Read and re-read entire dataset"
    - "Note initial ideas and patterns"
    - "Highlight interesting passages"
  tools: ["Annotation software", "Memo writing"]
  output: "Annotated transcripts, research journal notes"
  time_estimate: "20-30% of total coding time"

phase_2_initial_coding:
  activities:
    - "Systematic line-by-line coding"
    - "Create code labels"
    - "Organize data extracts by code"
  tools: ["CAQDAS", "Excel", "Index cards"]
  output: "Initial codebook (50-150 codes typical)"
  quality_check:
    - "Every data item coded"
    - "Data extracts retain context"
    - "Codes are specific enough to be meaningful"

phase_3_theme_searching:
  activities:
    - "Collate codes into potential themes"
    - "Mind mapping of relationships"
    - "Create theme tables"
  techniques:
    - "Post-it note sorting"
    - "Mind maps"
    - "Thematic tables"
  output: "Candidate themes (8-15 typical)"

phase_4_theme_review:
  level_1_review:
    action: "Check themes against coded data extracts"
    criteria: "Internal homogeneity (coherence within theme)"
  level_2_review:
    action: "Check themes against entire dataset"
    criteria: "External heterogeneity (distinction between themes)"
  output: "Refined themes, thematic map"

phase_5_theme_defining:
  activities:
    - "Name each theme"
    - "Write theme descriptions (2-3 paragraphs)"
    - "Identify essence of each theme"
    - "Define subthemes if needed"
  output:
    - "Final theme definitions"
    - "Thematic structure"
  quality_criteria:
    - "Theme names are concise and informative"
    - "Definitions capture unique contribution"
    - "No significant overlap between themes"

phase_6_report_writing:
  activities:
    - "Select vivid quotations"
    - "Write analytic narrative"
    - "Link themes to research question"
    - "Situate findings in literature"
  output: "Findings section with theme-based structure"
```

**Thematic Analysis Quality Checklist:**
```yaml
quality_criteria:
  data_engagement:
    - "[ ] Transcripts read multiple times"
    - "[ ] Coding checked against transcripts"
    - "[ ] Themes grounded in data extracts"

  coding_rigor:
    - "[ ] Each data item coded"
    - "[ ] Coding systematic and thorough"
    - "[ ] Similar codes collated"

  theme_coherence:
    - "[ ] Themes internally consistent"
    - "[ ] Themes distinct from each other"
    - "[ ] Thematic structure logical"

  transparency:
    - "[ ] Coding process described"
    - "[ ] Code-to-theme process explained"
    - "[ ] Sufficient quotations provided"
```

#### Grounded Theory (Charmaz, 2006)

```yaml
grounded_theory_coding:

  phase_1_initial_coding:
    approach: "Open coding - line-by-line analysis"
    coding_style:
      - "Use gerunds (verbs ending in -ing)"
      - "Stay close to data"
      - "Avoid premature interpretation"
    example:
      data: "I felt nervous talking to real people, but the chatbot didn't judge me"
      codes:
        - "feeling_nervous_with_humans"
        - "perceiving_chatbot_as_non_judgmental"
        - "comparing_human_vs_AI_interaction"

  phase_2_focused_coding:
    approach: "Select most frequent/significant codes"
    activities:
      - "Synthesize initial codes"
      - "Test codes against data"
      - "Develop categories"
    example:
      initial_codes: ["feeling_anxious", "fearing_judgment", "avoiding_speaking"]
      focused_code: "social_anxiety_in_language_learning"

  phase_3_axial_coding:
    approach: "Identify relationships between categories"
    framework:
      conditions: "When/why category occurs"
      actions_interactions: "How people respond"
      consequences: "What happens as result"
    example:
      category: "chatbot_psychological_safety"
      conditions: "High speaking anxiety + fear of peer judgment"
      actions: "Increased practice with AI, risk-taking in language use"
      consequences: "Gradual confidence building"

  phase_4_theoretical_coding:
    approach: "Integrate categories into theory"
    output: "Core category + theoretical model"
    example:
      core_category: "scaffolded_confidence_development"
      theoretical_model: "AI → Safe practice → Risk-taking → Competence → Human interaction"
```

**Grounded Theory Memos:**
```yaml
memo_types:

  code_memo:
    purpose: "Define and elaborate codes"
    example: |
      Memo: "Perceiving chatbot as non-judgmental"
      Date: 2024-10-15

      This code captures participants' descriptions of chatbots as lacking
      evaluative judgment. Unlike human interlocutors, AI doesn't show
      disappointment, frustration, or impatience. This perception creates
      psychological safety.

      Properties:
      - Non-verbal judgment absent (no eye-rolling, sighs)
      - Consistent tone regardless of errors
      - No social comparison with peers

      Related codes: "social_anxiety", "fear_of_negative_evaluation"

  theoretical_memo:
    purpose: "Develop conceptual relationships"
    example: |
      Theoretical Memo: Anxiety-Safety-Practice Loop

      Emerging pattern: High speaking anxiety → Preference for AI practice
      → Increased practice volume → Gradual confidence → Willingness to
      speak with humans.

      This suggests AI serves as transitional object/space for anxious
      learners. Not replacement for human interaction but scaffold toward it.

  operational_memo:
    purpose: "Track methodological decisions"
    example: |
      Operational Memo: Saturation assessment

      After 18 interviews, no new codes emerging for "chatbot affordances"
      category. Last 3 interviews yielded only variations on existing codes.
      Consider saturation reached for this category.
```

#### Content Analysis (Descriptive + Interpretive)

```yaml
content_analysis_coding:

  manifest_content:
    definition: "Surface-level, visible content"
    approach: "Objective, countable"
    examples:
      - "Frequency of 'chatbot' mentions"
      - "Number of positive vs. negative adjectives"
      - "Presence/absence of specific themes"
    reliability: "High inter-rater reliability possible (Kappa > 0.80)"

  latent_content:
    definition: "Underlying meaning, interpretive"
    approach: "Subjective, inferential"
    examples:
      - "Implicit attitudes toward AI"
      - "Underlying emotional tone"
      - "Power dynamics in human-AI interaction"
    reliability: "More challenging (Kappa 0.60-0.80 acceptable)"

  coding_units:
    word_level: "Individual words (e.g., AI, anxiety, practice)"
    phrase_level: "Meaningful phrases (e.g., 'felt less judged')"
    sentence_level: "Complete thoughts"
    paragraph_level: "Thematic segments"
    document_level: "Whole interview"
```

### 3. Code Quality Criteria

**High-Quality Code Entry Template:**

```yaml
code_template:

  code_name: "clear_descriptive_name"

  definition:
    conceptual: "Abstract definition of construct"
    operational: "How it manifests in data"

  when_to_use:
    inclusion_criteria:
      - "Criterion 1"
      - "Criterion 2"
    boundary_conditions: "Where code applies"

  when_not_to_use:
    exclusion_criteria:
      - "What this code is NOT"
      - "Common misapplications"
    edge_cases: "Ambiguous situations"

  example_quotes:
    typical_examples:
      - "Quote 1 [Participant 3, Line 45]"
      - "Quote 2 [Participant 7, Line 112]"
    boundary_examples:
      - "Borderline case [P5, L89] - coded because..."

  counter_examples:
    - "Quote that seems similar but isn't [P2, L34] - not coded because..."

  related_codes:
    parent_code: "Higher-level category"
    sibling_codes: ["Related codes at same level"]
    child_codes: ["More specific sub-codes"]

    date_created: "2024-10-15"
    created_by: "Researcher initials"
    source: "deductive/inductive"
    frequency: "Number of times applied"
```

**Example High-Quality Codebook Entry:**

```yaml
code_name: "perceived_judgment_anxiety"

definition:
  conceptual: "Psychological discomfort arising from anticipation of negative evaluation by others during language production"
  operational: "Participant explicitly mentions fear, worry, nervousness, or discomfort about being judged, evaluated, or criticized by others when speaking"

when_to_use:
  inclusion_criteria:
    - "Explicit mention of judgment, evaluation, or criticism from others"
    - "Affective states (fear, anxiety, nervousness) linked to social evaluation"
    - "Comparisons between human vs. AI interaction where judgment is factor"
  boundary_conditions: "Must be specific to language speaking context, not general social anxiety"

when_not_to_use:
  exclusion_criteria:
    - "Generic nervousness without reference to being judged"
    - "Task difficulty anxiety (not social evaluation)"
    - "Performance anxiety about grades (use 'grade_anxiety' code)"
  edge_cases: "Self-judgment (internal criticism) → use 'self_critical_perfectionism' instead"

example_quotes:
  typical_examples:
    - "I was scared my classmates would laugh at my pronunciation" [P3, L45]
    - "The chatbot doesn't judge me, but people do" [P7, L112]
    - "I felt nervous because the teacher would notice my mistakes" [P11, L201]
  boundary_examples:
    - "I was worried about saying the wrong thing" [P5, L89] - coded because implies judgment from listener

counter_examples:
  - "I was nervous because the vocabulary was difficult" [P2, L34] - NOT coded (task difficulty, not judgment)
  - "I felt anxious before the test" [P9, L156] - NOT coded (test anxiety, use 'evaluation_anxiety')

related_codes:
  parent_code: "affective_barriers"
  sibling_codes: ["speaking_anxiety_general", "fear_of_mistakes"]
  child_codes: ["peer_judgment_anxiety", "teacher_judgment_anxiety"]

      - "Compare to existing codes"
      - "Note: new/variation/duplicate"
      - "Track proportion of duplicates"
    saturation_threshold: ">90% of data segments fit existing codes"
```

**Saturation Memo Example:**

```yaml
saturation_memo:
  date: "2024-11-20"
  data_point: "After 18 interviews"

  observations:
    code_saturation:
      - "Last 3 interviews (16-18) added 0 new codes"
      - "Total codebook: 141 codes collapsed to 28 focused codes"
      - "All new data fit into existing framework"

    thematic_saturation:
      - "6 major themes stable since interview 12"
      - "Minor refinements to theme boundaries only"
      - "No structural changes to thematic map"

    information_saturation:
      - "Participants repeating same experiences"
      - "No novel insights about chatbot interaction patterns"
      - "Can predict responses based on existing data"

  decision: "Data collection complete. Saturation achieved for research question."

  transparency_note: "Acknowledge in write-up that saturation is context-dependent and future research may reveal new dimensions"
```

**When to Use Software vs. Manual Coding:**

```yaml
decision_tree:

  use_caqdas_if:
    - "Dataset > 10 interviews/documents"
    - "Need to reorganize codes frequently"
    - "Want automated code frequency reports"
    - "Multiple coders collaborating"

    purpose: "Summary table for manuscript"
```

## Best Practices

```yaml
best_practices:

  coding_consistency:
    - "[ ] Code in dedicated time blocks (avoid fatigue)"
    - "[ ] Re-code 10% of data after 1 week to check consistency"
    - "[ ] Keep coding manual open during all sessions"

  reflexivity:
    - "[ ] Write memos about own biases and assumptions"
    - "[ ] Discuss potential influence on code interpretation"
    - "[ ] Seek peer debriefing on coding decisions"

  transparency:
    - "[ ] Provide codebook in appendix or supplementary materials"
    - "[ ] Describe coding process in methods section (not just 'data were coded')"
    - "[ ] Include sufficient quotations in findings (not just summaries)"

  data_management:
    - "[ ] Backup coded data daily (multiple locations)"
    - "[ ] Version control for codebook (track changes)"
    - "[ ] Anonymize transcripts before sharing with coders"
```

## Common Pitfalls

```yaml
pitfalls:

  thin_coding:
    problem: "Codes too broad, not specific enough"
    example: "Code: 'motivation' applied to 100+ segments"
    solution: "Break into specific types (intrinsic, extrinsic, autonomous, controlled)"

  code_proliferation:
    problem: "Too many codes, no conceptual organization"
    example: "200+ codes, many overlapping"
    solution: "Collapse similar codes, create hierarchy"

  insufficient_examples:
    problem: "Codebook definitions without example quotes"
    solution: "Minimum 2-3 examples per code"

  ignoring_negative_cases:
    problem: "Only coding data that fits expected themes"
    solution: "Actively search for disconfirming evidence"

  over_reliance_on_software:
    problem: "Let CAQDAS dictate analysis, not researcher insight"
    solution: "Software is tool, not method. Interpretation remains human."
```

## Human Checkpoint
**CP_CODING_FRAMEWORK**: Review proposed codebook structure, coding approach, and saturation plan before data collection begins.

## Example Output

When researcher asks for help with coding:

```markdown
# Qualitative Coding Plan for [Research Topic]

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid (Deductive + Inductive)

### Phase 1: Deductive Framework (Based on Literature)
**A priori codes from [Theory Name]:**
- [Code 1]: [Definition]
- [Code 2]: [Definition]
- [Code 3]: [Definition]

### Phase 2: Inductive Open Coding
- Remain open to emergent codes beyond framework
- Track source of each code (deductive vs. inductive)

### Phase 3: Thematic Development
[Insert phased coding process based on method]

## Codebook Template
[Provide Excel template or CAQDAS structure]

## Inter-Rater Reliability Plan
- **Sample**: 20% of transcripts (n = X)
- **Metric**: Cohen's Kappa (target ≥ 0.75)
- **Process**: [Detailed IRR steps]

## Saturation Tracking
- Method: [Saturation grid / curve]
- Assessment points: After interviews 10, 15, 20
- Expected saturation: 18-22 interviews

## Software Recommendation
**Recommended**: [NVivo / MAXQDA / Dedoose]
**Rationale**: [Justify based on project needs]

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Refine codebook with advisor
2. [ ] Pilot code 2-3 transcripts
3. [ ] Train second coder (if IRR required)
4. [ ] Begin systematic coding
```
