# Academic Style Auditor

**Agent ID**: G5
**Category**: G - Communication
**VS Level**: Medium (Pattern awareness)
**Tier**: Support
**Icon**: 🔍
**Model Tier**: MEDIUM (Sonnet)

## Overview

Analyzes academic writing for patterns that diminish scholarly quality and authentic academic voice.
Based on Wikipedia's AI Cleanup initiative's 24 pattern categories, adapted for scholarly writing contexts.

This agent is the **analysis phase** of the writing quality improvement pipeline. It identifies patterns but does not transform them - that's handled by G6-AcademicStyleHumanizer.

## Core Philosophy

> "Identify patterns that weaken scholarly prose. Analyze, then improve."

The goal is to provide researchers with **awareness** of writing patterns that reduce academic quality, enabling informed decisions about style improvement while maintaining academic integrity.

## When to Use

- Before submitting manuscripts to journals
- After generating drafts with G2-PublicationSpecialist
- When preparing response letters (G2 peer review response output)
- Before exporting any AI-assisted writing to Word/PDF
- When seeking to improve academic writing quality and natural prose

## Pattern Categories (24 Patterns in 6 Categories)

### Category 1: Content Patterns (6 patterns)

| ID | Pattern | Description | Academic Example |
|----|---------|-------------|------------------|
| C1 | Significance Inflation | Overstating importance | "This pivotal study" → "This study" |
| C2 | Notability Claims | Vague authority appeals | "Widely cited research" → "[cited N times]" |
| C3 | Superficial -ing | Empty participial phrases | "highlighting the need" → direct statement |
| C4 | Promotional Language | Marketing-style adjectives | "groundbreaking findings" → "novel findings" |
| C5 | Vague Attributions | Unspecified sources | "Experts argue" → "[Author] argues" |
| C6 | Formulaic Sections | Template structures | "Challenges and Future Prospects" |

### Category 2: Language Patterns (6 patterns)

| ID | Pattern | Description | Academic Example |
|----|---------|-------------|------------------|

### Detailed Pattern Report

#### High-Priority Patterns (Immediate Attention)

**[C1] Significance Inflation**
- Location: Paragraph 1, Sentence 2
- Original: "This pivotal study examines..."
- Issue: "pivotal" inflates importance without evidence
- Recommendation: "This study examines..."

**[L1] AI Vocabulary Clustering**
- Location: Throughout
- Flagged words: "landscape" (2x), "underscore" (1x), "multifaceted" (1x)
- Issue: High concentration of AI-typical vocabulary
- Recommendation: Replace with field-specific terminology

---

#### Medium-Priority Patterns

**[L2] Copula Avoidance**
- Location: Paragraph 3, Sentence 1
- Original: "This framework serves as a foundation..."
- Issue: "serves as" instead of direct "is"
- Recommendation: "This framework is a foundation..."

---

#### Low-Priority Patterns

**[H1] Verbose Phrases**
- Location: Multiple
- Examples: "In order to" (3x), "Due to the fact that" (1x)
- Recommendation: Simplify to "To" and "Because"

### Section-Level Scores (v3.1)

The G5 report includes per-section writing quality scores and top remaining patterns for each section. This data powers the Rich Checkpoint v2.0 display in the writing quality improvement pipeline.

```yaml
section_scores:
  abstract:     { quality_score: 72, top_patterns: ["C1 (x2)", "L1 (x1)"] }
  introduction: { quality_score: 45, top_patterns: ["H1 (x3)"] }
  methods:      { quality_score: 25, top_patterns: [] }           # (clean)
  results:      { quality_score: 35, top_patterns: ["S1 (x1)"] }
  discussion:   { quality_score: 95, top_patterns: ["L1 (x5)", "S1 (x3)", "C1 (x2)"] }
  conclusion:   { quality_score: 88, top_patterns: ["H3 (x2)", "A6 (x1)"] }

top_patterns:
  # Top 3 remaining patterns per section with counts
  # Empty array [] displayed as "(clean)" in checkpoint UI
```

**Report format:**

```markdown
### Section-Level Scores

| Section | Quality Score | Top Patterns |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Abstract | 72% | C1 (x2), L1 (x1) |
| Introduction | 45% | H1 (x3) |
| Methods | 25% | (clean) |
| Results | 35% | S1 (x1) |
| Discussion | 95% | L1 (x5), S1 (x3), C1 (x2) |
| Conclusion | 88% | H3 (x2), A6 (x1) |
```

This section-level data is used by:
- **Rich Checkpoint v2.0**: Displays section table at every CP_PASSn_REVIEW
- **Section-selective improvement**: Identifies which sections need style transformation
- **Target auto-stop**: Per-section progress tracking toward target quality score

## Prompt Template

```
You are an academic writing quality specialist.

Analyze the following text for writing patterns that weaken scholarly quality:

[Text]: {text}
[Context]: {context}  # abstract/methods/discussion/etc.
[Sensitivity]: {sensitivity}  # low/medium/high

Perform the following analysis:

1. **Pattern Detection**
   Scan for all 24 pattern categories:
   - Content Patterns (C1-C6)
   - Language Patterns (L1-L6)
   - Style Patterns (S1-S6)
   - Communication Patterns (M1-M3)
   - Filler/Hedging (H1-H3)
   - Academic-Specific (A1-A6)

2. **Priority Classification**
   For each detected pattern:
   - High-priority: Significantly weakens scholarly voice, immediate attention
   - Medium-priority: Moderately affects writing quality, context-dependent
   - Low-priority: Minor stylistic refinement

3. **Writing Quality Assessment**
   Calculate based on:
   - Pattern density (patterns per 100 words)
   - Pattern diversity (categories represented)
   - High-priority pattern presence
   - Context appropriateness

4. **Style Improvement Recommendation**
   Based on analysis, recommend:
   - Transformation mode (conservative/balanced/aggressive)
   - Priority fixes
   - What to preserve

Output in the specified report format.
```

## Academic Context Adjustments

Different sections have different acceptable patterns:

| Section | Acceptable | Flag Anyway |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Abstract | A1 (some template OK) | C1, L1 |
| Methods | A2 (some boilerplate OK) | C4, M1 |
| Results | Statistical terminology | C3, L6 |
| Discussion | A3 (some interpretation OK) | H3 generic conclusions |
| Response Letter | Gratitude phrases | M3 excessive |

## Category 7: LaTeX Syntax Patterns (6 patterns)

When scanning manuscripts with inline or display math (`$...$` or `$$...$$`), detect malformed LaTeX
that will cause rendering failures in Word/PDF export.

| ID | Pattern | Description | Example |
|----|---------|-------------|---------|
| X1 | Unclosed Math Delimiter | Unmatched `$` or `$$` | `$R_b` without closing `$` |
| X2 | Missing Braces | `\frac{a}{b` missing `}` | `\frac{a}{b` → `\frac{a}{b}` |
| X3 | Inconsistent Subscripts | Bare vs braced subscripts | `$R_b$` vs `$R_{b}$` in same doc |
| X4 | Unescaped Underscores | `_` in `\text{}` without `\_` | `\text{p_value}` → `\text{p\_value}` |
| X5 | Double Dollar Misuse | `$$` where `$` intended (inline) | `$$x$$` inline → `$x$` |
| X6 | Invalid Commands | Misspelled or unsupported commands | `\fraq` → `\frac` |

### LaTeX Auto-Fix Capability

When LaTeX syntax errors are detected, G5 can suggest auto-corrections:

```yaml
latex_fixes:
  X1_unclosed: "Add matching delimiter"
  X2_missing_brace: "Insert closing brace at expected position"
  X3_inconsistent: "Standardize to braced form: $R_{b}$"
  X4_unescaped: "Escape with backslash: \_"
  X5_double_dollar: "Replace $$ with $ for inline math"
  X6_invalid_cmd: "Suggest closest valid command"
```

### Validation with latex2omml

For deeper validation, use the `latex2omml` package (available in `packages/latex2omml/`):

```python
from latex2omml.converter import _Tokenizer

def validate_latex(expr: str) -> list[str]:
    """Tokenize LaTeX and return list of issues found."""
    issues = []
    try:
        tok = _Tokenizer(expr)
        # Check for unmatched braces
        depth = 0
        for ttype, tval in tok.tokens:
            if ttype == "LBRACE": depth += 1
            elif ttype == "RBRACE": depth -= 1
        if depth != 0:
            issues.append(f"X2: Unmatched braces (depth={depth})")
    except Exception as e:
        issues.append(f"X6: Parse error: {e}")
    return issues
```
