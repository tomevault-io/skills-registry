# Test Execution

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Run Specific Test File
```bash
# Single spec file
npx playwright test tests/ui/basket.spec.ts

# With specific test name
npx playwright test tests/ui/basket.spec.ts -g "Remove product from cart"
```

### 2. Run All UI Tests
```bash
# All tests in ui directory
npx playwright test tests/ui/

# All tests
npx playwright test
```

### 3. Run Tagged Tests
```bash
# Run P1 priority tests
npx playwright test --grep @P1

# Run P2 priority tests
npx playwright test --grep @P2
```

### 4. Debug Mode
```bash
# Debug specific test (opens Playwright Inspector)
npx playwright test tests/ui/basket.spec.ts --debug

# Debug with specific test name
npx playwright test tests/ui/basket.spec.ts -g "Add product" --debug
```

### 5. Headed Mode (See Browser)
```bash
# Run with visible browser
npx playwright test tests/ui/basket.spec.ts --headed

# Slow down execution for visibility
npx playwright test tests/ui/basket.spec.ts --headed --slow-mo=1000
```

### 6. Run on Specific Browser
```bash
# Chromium only
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Run setup manually
npx playwright test --project=setup
```

### 7. Update Snapshots
```bash
# Update all snapshots
npx playwright test --update-snapshots

# Update specific test snapshots
npx playwright test tests/ui/basket.spec.ts --update-snapshots
```

## Common Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--headed` | Show browser window |
| `--debug` | Open Playwright Inspector |
| `--ui` | Open Playwright UI mode (interactive) |
| `-g "pattern"` | Run tests matching pattern |
| `--grep @P1` | Run tests with @P1 tag |
| `--project=chromium` | Run on specific browser |
| `--workers=1` | Run tests serially (for debugging) |
| `--reporter=list` | Use list reporter (verbose) |
| `--trace on` | Record trace for all tests |

## Interactive UI Mode
```bash
# Open Playwright UI (best for development)
npx playwright test --ui
```

## After Test Execution

1. **Check results** in console output
2. **If failures occur:**
   - Read error messages
   - Check screenshots in `playwright-report/`
   - Offer to open HTML report: `npx playwright show-report`
3. **Summarize:** passed/failed/skipped counts

## Troubleshooting

**If auth setup fails:**
```bash
# Run setup separately
npx playwright test tests/auth.setup.ts
```

**If parallel execution causes issues:**
```bash
# Run serially
npx playwright test --workers=1
```

**Clear test artifacts:**
```bash
# Remove auth files
rm -rf .auth/

# Remove reports
rm -rf playwright-report/ test-results/
```

## Best Practices

- Use `--headed` for visual debugging
- Use `--debug` to step through test actions
- Use `--ui` for interactive test development
- Run with `--workers=1` when debugging race conditions
- Check HTML report after failures for detailed diagnostics
