# Using Ghost Admin API

## Overview 

The user may ask you to create, edit or analyse posts on Houfu's alt-counsel.com blog.
Most Ghost operations are now handled via **ghst MCP tools** — native tools available directly in Claude Code.

## Workflow decision tree

* If there is already a separate SKILL that is used to perform the workflow, STOP and use that skill instead.
   * Example: `searching_the_blog` or `backlink_curating`
* **For reading/querying Ghost content** — use MCP tools directly (see quick reference below)
* **For posting a draft to Ghost from markdown** — use [creating_a_draft.md](creating_a_draft.md) (uses `publish-lexical.js` for custom lexical conversion)
* **For syncing Ghost post metadata back to local markdown (CHECK phase)** — run `npm run sync-ghost <slug>`

## Reference Documentation

* **[ghost-lexical-complete-guide.md](ghost-lexical-complete-guide.md)** — Comprehensive guide to Ghost's lexical format with real-world examples. Use when constructing complex lexical structures for `publish-lexical.js`.

## Reminders

* Always announce that you are using this skill.
* MCP tools handle authentication automatically via the ghst CLI. No manual JWT generation needed.
* Documentation is sparse from Ghost. Always report problems so that we can figure out together how to fix them and improve our instructions.
