## Language-Specific Review Patterns

### Python

```python
# Common Issues to Check

# 1. Mutable default arguments
def bad_func(items=[]):  # BUG: Shared mutable default
    pass

def good_func(items=None):  # CORRECT: None default
    items = items or []

# 2. Context managers
f = open('file.txt')  # BAD: Not using context manager
data = f.read()
f.close()

with open('file.txt') as f:  # GOOD: Context manager
    data = f.read()

# 3. Exception handling
except Exception:  # TOO BROAD
    pass

except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:  # SPECIFIC
    logger.error(f"Validation error: {e}")
    raise

# 4. Type hints
def process(data):  # MISSING TYPES
    pass

def process(data: dict[str, Any]) -> ProcessResult:  # TYPED
    pass

# 5. String formatting
msg = "Hello " + name + "!"  # BAD: Concatenation
msg = f"Hello {name}!"  # GOOD: f-string

# 6. List comprehension vs loop
result = []
for item in items:
    if item.valid:
        result.append(item.value)

result = [item.value for item in items if item.valid]  # BETTER
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript

```typescript
// Common Issues to Check

// 1. Null/undefined handling
user.name.toLowerCase();  // UNSAFE
user?.name?.toLowerCase();  // SAFE

// 2. Type assertions
const data = response as UserData;  // UNSAFE assertion
// Better: Use type guards
function isUserData(obj: unknown): obj is UserData {
    return obj !== null && typeof obj === 'object' && 'name' in obj;
}

// 3. Async/await errors
async function fetch() {
    doAsyncThing();  // MISSING await
    await doAsyncThing();  // CORRECT
}

// 4. Error handling in async
try {
    await riskyOperation();
} catch (e) {
    // Empty catch block - BAD
}

try {
    await riskyOperation();
} catch (e) {
    logger.error('Operation failed', { error: e });
    throw new ServiceError('Operation failed', { cause: e });
}

// 5. Strict equality
if (value == null) { }  // LOOSE equality
if (value === null || value === undefined) { }  // STRICT

// 6. Array methods
const found = items.find(i => i.id === id);
found.name;  // UNSAFE: find can return undefined
found?.name;  // SAFE: optional chaining

// 7. Import order and organization
import { z } from 'zod';
import React from 'react';
import { localThing } from './local';
import { Button } from '@/components';

// Should be organized: external, internal, local
```

### Go

```go
// Common Issues to Check

// 1. Error handling
result, err := doSomething()
// Missing error check - BAD

result, err := doSomething()
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("doing something: %w", err)
}

// 2. Defer in loops
for _, file := range files {
    f, _ := os.Open(file)
    defer f.Close()  // BAD: Defers accumulate
}

for _, file := range files {
    func() {
        f, _ := os.Open(file)
        defer f.Close()
        // process file
    }()  // GOOD: Defer executes each iteration
}

// 3. Goroutine leaks
go func() {
    for {
        // No exit condition - LEAK
    }
}()

// 4. Race conditions
var counter int
go func() { counter++ }()  // RACE
go func() { counter++ }()

var counter atomic.Int64  // SAFE
go func() { counter.Add(1) }()

// 5. Channel handling
ch := make(chan int)
// Sender doesn't close - receivers may block forever

// 6. Nil checks
if user != nil && user.Profile != nil && user.Profile.Name != "" {
    // VERBOSE but safe
}
```

### SQL

```sql
-- Common Issues to Check

-- 1. SQL Injection
-- BAD: String interpolation
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

-- GOOD: Parameterized query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1"

-- 2. SELECT *
-- BAD: Fetches all columns
SELECT * FROM large_table;

-- GOOD: Specific columns
SELECT id, name, email FROM large_table;

-- 3. Missing indexes (check EXPLAIN output)
-- Ensure WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY columns are indexed

-- 4. N+1 patterns
-- BAD: Query in loop
for user in users:
    orders = query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?", user.id)

-- GOOD: Batch query
orders = query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id IN (?)", user_ids)

-- 5. Missing LIMIT
-- BAD: Unbounded result set
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE level = 'ERROR';

-- GOOD: Bounded
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE level = 'ERROR' LIMIT 1000;

-- 6. Transaction handling
-- Ensure write operations are in transactions
-- Ensure proper isolation levels
```

## Review Communication Guidelines

### Constructive Feedback Principles

1. **Focus on code, not the author**
   - Say: "This function could be simplified by..."
   - Not: "You wrote this function poorly"

2. **Ask questions to understand**
   - "What was the reasoning behind this approach?"
   - "Have you considered alternative X?"

3. **Explain the 'why'**
   - Don't just say "change this"
   - Explain the benefit of the change

4. **Provide concrete examples**
   - Show the improved code
   - Reference documentation

5. **Acknowledge good work**
   - Highlight clever solutions
   - Praise improvements

### Feedback Templates

```markdown
## For Security Issues
[BLOCKING] **Security: SQL Injection Vulnerability**

The current implementation directly interpolates user input into the query:
```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
```

This allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL. For example, input `1; DROP TABLE users;--` would delete the table.

**Recommended fix:**
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

Reference: [OWASP SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)

---

## For Performance Issues
[MAJOR] **Performance: N+1 Query Pattern**

The current code executes a query for each user in the loop (N+1 pattern):
```python
for user in users:
    orders = db.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?", user.id)
```

With 1000 users, this executes 1001 queries instead of 2.

**Recommended fix:**
```python
user_ids = [u.id for u in users]
orders = db.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id IN (?)", user_ids)
orders_by_user = group_by(orders, lambda o: o.user_id)
```

This reduces database round trips from O(n) to O(1).

---

## For Maintainability Issues
[MINOR] **Maintainability: Magic Number**

The value `86400` appears without explanation:
```python
cache_expiry = 86400
```

Consider extracting to a named constant:
```python
CACHE_EXPIRY_SECONDS = 86400  # 24 hours
cache_expiry = CACHE_EXPIRY_SECONDS
```

This improves readability and makes the intent clear.

---

## For Positive Feedback
[PRAISE] **Excellent use of the Strategy Pattern**

The payment processor implementation using the strategy pattern is clean and extensible:
```python
class PaymentProcessor(Protocol):
    def process(self, amount: Decimal) -> PaymentResult: ...
```

This makes it easy to add new payment providers without modifying existing code. Great adherence to Open/Closed principle!
```

## Automated Review Integration

### Pre-Review Automated Checks

Before manual review, ensure these automated checks pass:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Example
name: PR Checks

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint

  type-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Type Check
        run: npm run type-check

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Test
        run: npm run test -- --coverage
      - name: Check Coverage
        run: |
          coverage=$(cat coverage/coverage-summary.json | jq '.total.lines.pct')
          if (( $(echo "$coverage < 80" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "Coverage below 80%: $coverage%"
            exit 1
          fi

  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Security Scan
        run: npm audit --audit-level=high
```
