# Git Worktrees

Work on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing or switching.

## Quick Reference

### Core Commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| List worktrees | `git worktree list` |
| Add worktree | `git worktree add ../path branch` |
| Add new branch | `git worktree add -b new-branch ../path` |
| Remove worktree | `git worktree remove ../path` |
| Prune stale | `git worktree prune` |
| Lock worktree | `git worktree lock ../path` |

## Key Concepts

### What is a Worktree?

```
main-repo/                    # Main worktree (default)
+-- .git/                     # Shared Git database
+-- src/
+-- ...

../main-repo-feature-auth/    # Linked worktree
+-- .git --> main-repo/.git   # Points to main .git
+-- src/                      # Independent working files
+-- ...
```

### Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **No stashing** | Keep uncommitted work while switching context |
| **Parallel work** | Work on multiple features simultaneously |
| **Clean reviews** | Review PRs in isolated directories |
| **Experiments** | Try things without affecting main work |
| **Fast switching** | Just `cd` to another directory |

## Common Workflows

### 1. Parallel Feature Development

```bash
# You're working on feature A
cd ~/repos/my-project
git checkout feature-a
# ... making changes ...

# Urgent: Need to work on feature B
git worktree add ../my-project-feature-b feature-b

# Work on feature B in the new directory
cd ../my-project-feature-b
# ... make changes, commit ...

# Go back to feature A - your work is still there!
cd ../my-project
```

### 2. PR Review in Isolation

```bash
# Fetch the PR
git fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123

# Create worktree for review
git worktree add ../project-pr-123 pr-123

# Review in the isolated worktree
cd ../project-pr-123
npm install && npm test

# Back to your work
cd ../project

# Clean up after review
git worktree remove ../project-pr-123
git branch -d pr-123
```

### 3. Long-running Experiments

```bash
# Create experiment worktree
git worktree add -b experiment/new-architecture ../project-experiment

# Work on experiment over days/weeks
cd ../project-experiment

# Lock it to prevent accidental deletion
git worktree lock ../project-experiment

# Continue normal work in main repo
cd ../project
```

### 4. Hotfix While Mid-Feature

```bash
# Mid-feature, need to hotfix
git worktree add ../project-hotfix main

cd ../project-hotfix
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug

# Fix, test, push
git add . && git commit -m "fix: critical bug"
git push origin hotfix/critical-bug

# Clean up and return
cd ../project
git worktree remove ../project-hotfix
```

## Naming Convention

Recommended worktree directory naming:

```
{repo-name}-{purpose}/
```

Examples:
- `my-app-feature-auth/` - Feature work
- `my-app-pr-123/` - PR review
- `my-app-experiment-v2/` - Experimental work
- `my-app-hotfix/` - Hotfix branch

## Best Practices

### DO
- Use descriptive directory names
- Clean up worktrees after use
- Lock long-running worktrees
- Run `git worktree prune` periodically
- Keep worktrees in sibling directories

### DON'T
- Create worktrees inside the main repo
- Delete worktree directories manually (use `git worktree remove`)
- Forget to install dependencies in each worktree
- Have too many worktrees (they take disk space)
- Share node_modules between worktrees

## IDE Integration

### VS Code

Open each worktree as a separate window:
```bash
cd ../project-feature-b
code .
```

Or use Multi-root Workspaces to see all worktrees.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "branch already checked out" | That branch is in another worktree |
| "not a git repository" | Worktree was moved/deleted incorrectly |
| Stale worktree entries | Run `git worktree prune` |
| Can't delete worktree | `git worktree unlock` first if locked |
| Missing dependencies | Run install in each worktree |

## When to Use This Skill

- Working on multiple features simultaneously
- Reviewing pull requests without disrupting work
- Running long-term experiments
- Handling urgent hotfixes mid-feature
- Testing different branches side by side
- Comparing code across branches
