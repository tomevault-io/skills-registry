# Harness Coding Agent Skill

Autonomous coding skill for multi-session development projects. Continues work from previous sessions, implements one feature at a time, and maintains clean handoffs for future sessions via Archon task management.

## Triggers

Use this skill when:
- Continuing autonomous coding sessions
- Implementing features in multi-session projects
- Working with harness-based development
- Keywords: harness, coder, coding agent, autonomous coding, session continuation, feature implementation

## Core Mission

This is a continuation session in a multi-session autonomous development project. You must:

1. **Get your bearings** - Understand current state from Archon
2. **Verify existing features** - Run health checks on completed work
3. **Implement one feature** - Focus on highest priority TODO task
4. **Coordinate with skills** - Use testing and review skills
5. **Clean handoff** - Update Archon and commit for next session

## Step-by-Step Protocol

### STEP 1: Orient & Get Your Bearings (MANDATORY)

This is a **FRESH context window** - you have no memory of previous sessions.

```bash
# 1. Verify working directory
pwd

# 2. List project files
ls -la

# 3. Read harness configuration
cat .harness/config.json
```

Then query Archon:

```python
# Get project ID from config
PROJECT_ID = "<from .harness/config.json>"

# Get session notes for context
session_notes = find_documents(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    document_type="note",
    query="Session Notes"
)

# Get current task status
tasks = find_tasks(
    filter_by="project",
    filter_value=PROJECT_ID
)

# Find META task for session tracking
meta_task = find_tasks(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    query="META Session Tracking"
)
```

```bash
# Check git history
git log --oneline -15
git status
```

### STEP 2: Analyze Current State

From the Archon data, determine:

1. **Last session summary** - What was completed?
2. **Current task** - Is there a task in "doing" status?
3. **Blockers** - Any issues from previous session?
4. **Test status** - Are all completed features passing?

If a task is in "doing" status:
- It was left incomplete from previous session
- Continue working on it (don't start new)

If no "doing" task:
- Select highest priority "todo" task

### STEP 3: Verify Health of Completed Features

Before implementing new work, verify existing features work:

```bash
# Run test suite
npm test          # or pytest, go test, etc.

# Check for build errors
npm run build     # or equivalent
```

**If tests fail:**
1. Identify the failing feature's task in Archon
2. Update task status back to "todo"
3. Fix the issue BEFORE starting new work
4. Re-run tests until passing

**If tests pass:**
Continue to implementation.

### STEP 4: Select and Start Task

```python
# Find highest priority TODO task
todo_tasks = find_tasks(
    filter_by="status",
    filter_value="todo",
    project_id=PROJECT_ID
)

# Select task with highest task_order
selected_task = max(todo_tasks, key=lambda t: t["task_order"])

# Mark as doing
manage_task("update",
    task_id=selected_task["id"],
    status="doing",
    assignee="Coding Agent"
)
```

### STEP 5: Implement the Feature

Read the task description carefully. It contains:
- Requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Test steps
- Dependencies

Implement the feature following project patterns:

1. **Write the code** - Follow existing patterns in codebase
2. **Add tests** - Unit and integration tests
3. **Update documentation** - If API changes
4. **Handle errors** - Proper error handling

#### Implementation Guidelines

**Do:**
- Follow existing code patterns
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Use meaningful variable/function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle edge cases

**Don't:**
- Change unrelated code
- Remove existing tests
- Skip error handling
- Leave TODO comments
- Create overly complex solutions

### STEP 6: Coordinate Testing

After implementation, use the harness-tester skill:

```bash
# Run tests directly
npm test -- --grep "[feature-related-tests]"
```

Or invoke the testing workflow per your project's testing strategy.

**Wait for test results.** If tests fail:
1. Fix the issues
2. Re-run tests
3. Repeat until passing

### STEP 7: Coordinate Review (Optional but Recommended)

For complex features, use the harness-reviewer skill to check:
- Code quality
- Architecture consistency
- Security concerns

Address any review feedback before marking complete.

### STEP 8: Mark Task Complete

Once tests pass and review (if done) is approved:

```python
# Update task to review status first
manage_task("update",
    task_id="<TASK_ID>",
    status="review",
    description="""[ORIGINAL_DESCRIPTION]

---
## Implementation Notes (Session [X])
- Implemented [summary of what was done]
- Tests added: [list of test files/cases]
- Files changed: [list of key files]

## Test Results
- Unit tests: PASSING
- Integration: PASSING
- E2E: PASSING (if applicable)
"""
)

# If all tests pass, mark as done
manage_task("update",
    task_id="<TASK_ID>",
    status="done"
)
```

### STEP 9: Update Session Notes

```python
# Get current session notes
notes = find_documents(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    query="Session Notes"
)

# Append new session
current_sessions = notes["content"]["sessions"]
current_sessions.append({
    "session_number": len(current_sessions) + 1,
    "agent": "harness-coder",
    "date": "<TIMESTAMP>",
    "status": "completed",
    "task_completed": {
        "id": "<TASK_ID>",
        "title": "<TASK_TITLE>",
        "feature": "<FEATURE_GROUP>"
    },
    "files_changed": [
        # List of files modified
    ],
    "tests_added": [
        # List of test files/cases added
    ],
    "notes": [
        # Any important context
    ],
    "next_priority": {
        "id": "<NEXT_TASK_ID>",
        "title": "<NEXT_TASK_TITLE>"
    }
})

manage_document("update",
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    document_id="<NOTES_DOC_ID>",
    content={
        "sessions": current_sessions,
        "current_focus": "<NEXT_TASK_TITLE>",
        "blockers": [],
        "next_steps": [
            "Continue with <NEXT_TASK_TITLE>",
        ],
        "decisions": notes["content"].get("decisions", [])
    }
)
```

### STEP 10: Update META Task

```python
# Get task stats
all_tasks = find_tasks(filter_by="project", filter_value=PROJECT_ID)
done_count = len([t for t in all_tasks if t["status"] == "done"])
total_count = len([t for t in all_tasks if t["feature"] != "Meta"])

manage_task("update",
    task_id="<META_TASK_ID>",
    description=f"""## Current Session Status
- Session: [X]
- Agent: harness-coder
- Status: Complete

## Session Summary
- Completed: [TASK_TITLE]
- Tests: All passing
- Files changed: [X] files

## Progress
- Total Tasks: {total_count}
- Completed: {done_count}
- Remaining: {total_count - done_count}
- Progress: {int(done_count/total_count*100)}%

## Next Session
- Task: [NEXT_TASK_TITLE]
- Task ID: [NEXT_TASK_ID]
- Priority: [PRIORITY]

---
Last Updated: <TIMESTAMP>"""
)
```

### STEP 11: Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "[FEATURE_GROUP]: [TASK_TITLE]

Implemented:
- [Summary point 1]
- [Summary point 2]

Tests:
- Added [X] unit tests
- Added [X] integration tests

Task: [TASK_ID] - DONE
Session: [X]
Archon Project: [PROJECT_ID]"
```

### STEP 12: Clean Handoff Summary

Display summary for next session:

```markdown
## Session [X] Complete

### Task Completed
- **Title**: [TASK_TITLE]
- **Feature**: [FEATURE_GROUP]
- **Status**: Done

### Changes Made
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| src/... | Added ... |
| tests/... | Added ... |

### Test Results
- Unit: [X]/[X] passing
- Integration: [X]/[X] passing
- E2E: [X]/[X] passing

### Progress
- Completed: [X]/[TOTAL] tasks ([X]%)
- Remaining: [Y] tasks

### Next Task
- **Title**: [NEXT_TASK_TITLE]
- **Priority**: [PRIORITY]
- **Feature**: [FEATURE_GROUP]

## Handling Issues

### If You Find Bugs in Existing Features

1. Create a new high-priority task:
   ```python
   manage_task("create",
       project_id=PROJECT_ID,
       title="Fix: [Bug description]",
       description="...",
       status="todo",
       task_order=98,  # High priority
       feature="Bugfix"
   )
   ```
2. Update the affected feature's task status
3. Fix before continuing with new features

### If Tests Won't Pass

1. Spend reasonable time debugging
2. If stuck, document the issue:
   ```python
   manage_task("update",
       task_id="<TASK_ID>",
       status="todo",  # Reset to todo
       description="""[ORIGINAL + ]

   ---
   ## Blocker (Session [X])
   - Issue: [Description]
   - Tried: [What you attempted]
   - Needs: [What help is needed]
   """
   )
   ```
3. Update session notes with blocker
4. Move to next task if appropriate

### If Environment Breaks

1. Try to fix using git history: `git diff`, `git checkout`
2. Document what happened
3. Create high-priority fix task
4. Don't leave environment broken

---

## Critical Rules

1. **ONE FEATURE PER SESSION** - Don't try to do too much
2. **NEVER SKIP TESTS** - Always run tests after implementation
3. **NEVER REMOVE TESTS** - Fix code, not tests
4. **ALWAYS UPDATE ARCHON** - Tasks, session notes, META task
5. **ALWAYS COMMIT** - Clean state for next session
6. **FIX BUGS FIRST** - Existing issues before new features
7. **CLEAN HANDOFF** - Next session should understand state immediately

---

## Quick Reference: Archon Commands

```python
# Find tasks
find_tasks(filter_by="project", filter_value=PROJECT_ID)
find_tasks(filter_by="status", filter_value="todo")
find_tasks(task_id="<specific_id>")

# Update task status
manage_task("update", task_id="...", status="doing")
manage_task("update", task_id="...", status="review")
manage_task("update", task_id="...", status="done")

# Get documents
find_documents(project_id=PROJECT_ID, query="Session Notes")

# Update documents
manage_document("update", project_id=PROJECT_ID, document_id="...", content={...})
```

---

## Session Time Management

Typical session should:
- **First 5 min**: Orient and verify health
- **Main portion**: Implement feature
- **Last 10 min**: Test, update Archon, commit, handoff

If running low on context/time:
1. Stop at a clean point
2. Update task with progress notes
3. Commit partial work
4. Update session notes with "in progress" status
5. Handoff for next session to continue
