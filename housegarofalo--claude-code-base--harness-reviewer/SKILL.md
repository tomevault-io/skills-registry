# Harness Review Skill

Specialized code review skill for the autonomous harness system. Reviews code changes before features are marked complete, ensuring code quality, architectural consistency, and security best practices.

## Triggers

Use this skill when:
- Reviewing code in harness workflow
- Validating code before completion
- Checking architecture consistency
- Performing security reviews
- Keywords: harness review, code review, review changes, architecture check, security scan, quality check

## Core Mission

Provide thorough code review that:
1. **Catches issues early** - Before they become technical debt
2. **Ensures consistency** - With existing patterns and architecture
3. **Verifies security** - No vulnerabilities introduced
4. **Provides feedback** - Actionable, specific, constructive

---

## Review Modes

### Mode 1: Review Specific Feature
Review changes for a specific task/feature.

### Mode 2: Review Recent Changes
Review git diff from recent commits.

### Mode 3: Architecture Review
Deep review of architectural patterns and consistency.

### Mode 4: Security Scan
Focused security vulnerability detection.

---

## Review Protocol

### STEP 1: Gather Context

```bash
# Get recent changes
git log --oneline -5
git diff HEAD~1 --stat
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only
```

```python
# Get task details from Archon
task = find_tasks(task_id="<TASK_ID>")
feature_requirements = task["description"]

# Get session notes for context
notes = find_documents(project_id=PROJECT_ID, query="Session Notes")
```

### STEP 2: Identify Changed Files

```bash
# Get list of changed files
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only

# Categorize changes
# - Source code: src/**
# - Tests: tests/**
# - Config: *.json, *.yaml, *.toml
# - Documentation: docs/**, *.md
```

### STEP 3: Perform Code Review

For each changed file, check:

#### 3.1 Code Quality
- [ ] Functions are focused (single responsibility)
- [ ] Variable names are meaningful
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No debug statements left in
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No obvious bugs or logic errors

#### 3.2 Architecture Consistency
- [ ] Follows existing patterns in codebase
- [ ] Correct layer placement (services, controllers, etc.)
- [ ] Dependencies flow in correct direction
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns

#### 3.3 Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (output escaping)
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks
- [ ] Sensitive data handling

#### 3.4 Testing
- [ ] Tests exist for new functionality
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Tests are meaningful (not just for coverage)
- [ ] No tests removed or weakened

#### 3.5 Documentation
- [ ] Public APIs documented
- [ ] Complex logic has comments
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] Breaking changes noted

### STEP 4: Generate Review Report

```python
review_result = {
    "status": "approved" | "changes_requested" | "blocked",
    "summary": "...",
    "findings": [
        {
            "severity": "critical" | "major" | "minor" | "suggestion",
            "file": "path/to/file",
            "line": 42,
            "issue": "Description of issue",
            "suggestion": "How to fix"
        }
    ],
    "tests_verified": True | False,
    "architecture_ok": True | False,
    "security_ok": True | False
}
```

### STEP 5: Update Archon Task

```python
manage_task("update",
    task_id="<TASK_ID>",
    description=f"""[ORIGINAL_DESCRIPTION]

## Code Review (by harness-reviewer)
**Timestamp**: {timestamp}
**Status**: {review_status}

### Summary

### Checks
- [{"x" if code_quality_ok else " "}] Code Quality
- [{"x" if architecture_ok else " "}] Architecture Consistency
- [{"x" if security_ok else " "}] Security
- [{"x" if tests_verified else " "}] Tests Verified

## Review Standards

### Critical (Must Fix Before Completion)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss potential
- Breaking changes without migration
- Missing authentication/authorization
- Exposed secrets or credentials

### Major (Should Fix)
- Significant code quality issues
- Architecture violations
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete test coverage for critical paths

### Minor (Consider Fixing)
- Code style inconsistencies
- Suboptimal patterns
- Missing edge case tests
- Documentation gaps

### Suggestion (Nice to Have)
- Performance optimizations
- Code organization improvements
- Additional documentation
- Better variable naming

## Output Format

### Approved

```markdown
## Code Review: APPROVED

**Feature**: [FEATURE_NAME]
**Task**: [TASK_ID]
**Reviewer**: harness-reviewer

### Summary
Code changes implement the feature correctly and follow project standards.

### Checks
- [x] Code Quality - Clean, readable code
- [x] Architecture - Follows existing patterns
- [x] Security - No vulnerabilities found
- [x] Tests - Adequate coverage

### Suggestions (Optional)
1. Consider extracting the validation logic to a utility function
2. Add JSDoc comment to the exported interface

**Verdict**: Ready to merge
**Archon Updated**: Yes
```

### Changes Requested

```markdown
## Code Review: CHANGES REQUESTED

**Feature**: [FEATURE_NAME]
**Task**: [TASK_ID]
**Reviewer**: harness-reviewer

### Summary
Good implementation overall, but a few issues need addressing.

### Findings

#### Major: Missing Input Validation
**File**: `src/api/users.ts:45`
**Issue**: User input not validated before database query
**Fix**: Add Zod schema validation before processing

```typescript
// Current
const user = req.body;
await db.users.create(user);

// Suggested
const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100)
});
const user = userSchema.parse(req.body);
await db.users.create(user);
```

#### Minor: Inconsistent Error Handling
**File**: `src/services/auth.ts:78`
**Issue**: Some paths throw, others return null
**Fix**: Standardize on throwing AuthError for auth failures

### Checks
- [x] Code Quality
- [x] Architecture
- [ ] Security - Input validation needed
- [x] Tests

**Verdict**: Address findings and re-request review
**Archon Updated**: Yes (status set to "review")
```

### Blocked

```markdown
## Code Review: BLOCKED

**Feature**: [FEATURE_NAME]
**Task**: [TASK_ID]
**Reviewer**: harness-reviewer

### Summary
Critical security issue found that must be addressed.

### Blockers

#### CRITICAL: Hardcoded API Key
**File**: `src/services/payment.ts:12`
**Issue**: API key hardcoded in source code
**Risk**: Credential exposure if code is public

```typescript
// CRITICAL - REMOVE THIS
const STRIPE_KEY = "sk_live_abc123...";
```

**Fix**:
1. Remove key from code immediately
2. Rotate the exposed key in Stripe dashboard
3. Use environment variable instead

### Checks
- [ ] Security - CRITICAL ISSUE

**Verdict**: DO NOT MERGE - Address critical issue first
**Archon Updated**: Yes (task reset to "doing")
```

## Common Issues to Watch For

### Security
| Issue | Detection | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Hardcoded secrets | `grep -r "sk_" "api_key" "password"` | Use env vars |
| SQL injection | Raw query strings with interpolation | Parameterized queries |
| XSS | `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML` | Sanitize/escape |
| Auth bypass | Missing auth middleware | Add guards |
| CSRF | Forms without tokens | Add CSRF tokens |

### Code Quality
| Issue | Detection | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| God functions | Functions > 50 lines | Split into smaller |
| Magic numbers | Unexplained numeric values | Use constants |
| Deep nesting | > 3 levels of indentation | Early returns |
| Dead code | Unreachable or unused | Remove |
| Copy-paste | Duplicated blocks | Extract function |

### Architecture
| Issue | Detection | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Wrong layer | Business logic in controller | Move to service |
| Circular deps | Import cycles | Restructure |
| Leaky abstraction | Implementation details exposed | Add interface |
| Missing boundaries | Direct DB access from UI | Add service layer |

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER approve with critical issues** - Block the completion
2. **BE SPECIFIC** - Include file, line, and fix suggestion
3. **BE CONSTRUCTIVE** - Explain why, not just what
4. **CHECK TESTS** - Verify tests exist and are meaningful
5. **FOLLOW STANDARDS** - Use project's existing patterns as baseline
6. **UPDATE ARCHON** - Record review results for tracking
7. **RESET STATUS if blocked** - Task goes back to "doing"
