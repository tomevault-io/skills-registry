### Quick PRP (Lightweight)

For smaller features or quick tasks:

```markdown
# Quick PRP: [Title]

## What
[1-2 sentences describing the change]

## Why
[Business/technical justification]

## How
[High-level approach]

## Tasks
1. [ ] [Task 1]
2. [ ] [Task 2]
3. [ ] [Task 3]

## Testing
- [ ] [Test 1]
- [ ] [Test 2]

## Done When
- [ ] [Acceptance criterion 1]
- [ ] [Acceptance criterion 2]
```

### Best Practices

1. **Start with Why**: Always explain the business value
2. **Be Specific**: Vague requirements lead to rework
3. **Include Acceptance Criteria**: Define "done"
4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Document error handling
5. **Plan for Failure**: Include rollback strategies
6. **Get Feedback Early**: Share drafts before implementing
7. **Keep Updated**: PRPs are living documents
8. **Link Everything**: Connect to issues, PRs, docs

### Converting PRP to Tasks

After PRP approval, create Archon tasks:

```python
# For each implementation phase
manage_task("create",
    project_id="...",
    title="[Phase]: [Task name]",
    description="From PRP: [link]\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- [ ] ...",
    feature="prp-feature-name"
)
```
