# Effort level
effort_scores = {"low": 1, "medium": 3, "high": 5, "very_high": 8}
complexity_score += effort_scores[effort_level]

# Technical factors (1 point each)
complexity_score += len(technical_factors)

# Dependencies (2 points each external, 1 each internal)
complexity_score += len(external_dependencies) * 2
complexity_score += len(internal_dependencies)

# Risk factors (1.5 points each)
complexity_score += len(risk_factors) * 1.5

# Determine approach
if complexity_score < 5:
    approach = "direct_implementation"
elif complexity_score < 10:
    approach = "plan_then_implement"
elif complexity_score < 18:
    approach = "prd_with_plan"
else:
    approach = "prd_multi_phase"

## Success Criteria
{format_criteria(phase['validation'])}

## Related PRD
See document: PRD: {feature_name}
""",
        status="todo",
        task_order=100 - (phase_index * 10),
        feature=feature_name
    )

    # Create individual tasks within phase
    for task_index, task in enumerate(phase['tasks']):
        manage_task("create",
            project_id=PROJECT_ID,
            title=f"[{feature_name}] {task['title']}",
            description=f"""
## Task Description
{task['description']}

## Acceptance Criteria
{format_acceptance_criteria(task['criteria'])}

## Validation
- Build: {task.get('build_validation', 'N/A')}
- Test: {task.get('test_validation', 'N/A')}
- Manual: {task.get('manual_validation', 'N/A')}

## Parent Phase
Phase {phase_index + 1}: {phase['name']}
""",
            status="todo",
            task_order=100 - (phase_index * 10) - (task_index + 1),
            feature=f"{feature_name}:Phase{phase_index + 1}"
        )
```

### Task Status Flow

```
Task Status Flow:
  todo -> doing -> review -> done

When moving to next phase:
  1. All tasks in current phase must be "done"
  2. All validation checkpoints must pass
  3. Update phase task status
  4. Begin next phase tasks
```

---

## Execution Workflow

Step-by-step execution with validation loops.

### Execution Steps

```markdown
## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Load Context
1. Read PRD from Archon documents
2. Load implementation plan
3. Identify current phase and task
4. Check validation checkpoint status

### Step 2: Execute Task
1. Mark task as "doing"
2. Implement according to task description
3. Follow acceptance criteria
4. Run validation commands

### Step 3: Validate
1. Run build validation
2. Run test validation
3. Run lint validation
4. Perform manual checks if required

### Step 4: Report
1. Update task status based on validation
2. If PASS: Mark task "review" or "done"
3. If FAIL: Document failure, keep task "doing"
4. Update Archon with progress notes

### Step 5: Next Task
1. Check if phase complete
2. If phase complete, run phase validation
3. If phase validation passes, start next phase
4. If all phases complete, feature is done
```

### Validation Loop

```python
def execute_with_validation(task_id):
    """Execute task with validation loop."""

    # 1. Get task details
    task = find_tasks(task_id=task_id)
    manage_task("update", task_id=task_id, status="doing")

    # 2. Execute implementation
    implement_task(task)

    # 3. Run validation
    validation_results = {
        "build": run_build_validation(),
        "test": run_test_validation(),
        "lint": run_lint_validation()
    }

    # 4. Check results
    all_passed = all(v["passed"] for v in validation_results.values())

    if all_passed:
        # Move to review/done
        manage_task("update",
            task_id=task_id,

```markdown
# Quick PRP: [Feature Name]

## What
[1-2 sentences describing the change]

## Why
[Business/technical justification]

## How
[High-level approach]

## Tasks
1. [ ] [Task 1]
2. [ ] [Task 2]
3. [ ] [Task 3]

## Validation
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Manual verification

## Done When
- [ ] [Acceptance criterion 1]
- [ ] [Acceptance criterion 2]
```

### Enhancement PRP (Medium Complexity)

For enhancements to existing features:

```markdown
# Enhancement PRP: [Feature Enhancement Name]

## Current Behavior
[How the feature works now]

## Desired Behavior
[How it should work after enhancement]

## User Impact
[Who benefits and how]

## Technical Approach
[How we'll implement this]

## Tasks
### Phase 1: Analysis
1. [ ] Review existing code
2. [ ] Identify change points

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. [ ] Implement changes
2. [ ] Update tests
3. [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 3: Validation
1. [ ] Run all tests
2. [ ] Manual QA
3. [ ] Performance check

## Rollback Plan
[How to revert if issues arise]
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Resolutions

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| PRD too vague | Re-run Phase 1 with more detailed questions |
| Complexity underestimated | Regenerate implementation plan with higher complexity |
| Validation failing | Identify failing validation, fix, re-run |
| Task blocked by dependency | Mark as blocked, work on other tasks |
| Scope creep | Document in "Out of Scope", create separate PRD |
| Missing requirements | Update PRD, regenerate affected tasks |

### Recovery Procedures

```markdown
## Recovery Procedures

### Validation Failure Recovery
1. Identify failing validation
2. Analyze error output
3. Fix the issue
4. Re-run validation
5. If still failing, document and escalate

### Blocked Task Recovery
1. Identify blocking dependency
2. Create task for dependency if missing
3. Update task with blocker reference
4. Work on unblocked tasks
5. Return when blocker resolved

### Scope Change Recovery
1. Document requested change
2. Assess impact on existing PRD
3. Update PRD with changes
4. Regenerate affected tasks
5. Update timeline estimates
6. Get stakeholder approval
```

## Best Practices

### PRD Writing

1. **Be Specific**: Vague requirements lead to rework
2. **Define Success**: Every goal needs a measurable metric
3. **Include Edge Cases**: Document error handling up front
4. **Set Boundaries**: Out of scope is as important as in scope
5. **Living Document**: Update PRD as you learn more

### Implementation

1. **One Phase at a Time**: Complete and validate before moving on
2. **Validate Often**: Run validations after each significant change
3. **Document Decisions**: Record why you chose specific approaches
4. **Keep Tests Current**: Tests should evolve with implementation
5. **Clean Commits**: Each commit should be a logical, working unit

### Archon Integration

1. **Update Status**: Always update task status when state changes
2. **Add Notes**: Document blockers, decisions, and discoveries
3. **Track Time**: Note actual duration vs. estimates
4. **Link Related Items**: Connect tasks to PRD and each other

## Command Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/prp-wizard` | Start PRP wizard |
| `/prp-wizard --quick` | Quick PRP for simple features |
| `/prp-wizard --resume` | Resume existing PRP |
| `/prp-status` | Check PRP implementation status |
| `/prp-validate` | Run validation checkpoint |
| `/prp-tasks` | Generate Archon tasks from PRD |

---

## Integration with Project Wizard

When invoked from project-wizard skill:

```python
# Project wizard hands off to PRP wizard
if selected_framework == "prp":
    # Pass context from project wizard
    prp_context = {
        "project_name": project_name,
        "project_type": project_type,
        "tech_stack": tech_stack,
        "archon_project_id": project_id,
        "working_directory": working_dir
    }

    # PRP wizard continues with Phase 1
    # Skip redundant questions already answered
```

---

## Notes

- PRD quality directly impacts implementation quality
- Complexity assessment helps choose the right approach
- Validation checkpoints catch issues early
- Archon integration enables progress tracking across sessions
- Templates are starting points - adapt to project needs
- Always update PRD when requirements change
