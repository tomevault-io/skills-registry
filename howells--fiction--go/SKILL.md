Resume work on a fiction project. This loads the project into context and provides a clear recommendation for what to work on next.

## Current State

- Recent changes: !`git log --oneline -3 2>/dev/null || echo "not a git repo"`
- Progress file: !`cat progress.md 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "no progress.md"`

## What to Do

### 1. Load the Project

**Find Project Root** — Look for README.md with story information, chapters/ directory, characters/ directory.

**Read Core Documents:**
- README.md — Project overview, status, key decisions
- themes.md — Central question, thematic content
- craft/tone.md — Voice, style guidance, and Language & Style config (English variant, style guide)

**Read Character Documents** — All files in characters/

**Read World Documents** — All files in world/

**Scan Chapters:**
- For 10+ chapters: use the manuscript digest
  1. Check for `manuscript-digest.md` in the project root
  2. If fresh, read it directly — no agents needed
  3. If missing or stale, spawn reader-digest:
     ```
     Task tool with subagent_type: "fiction:reader-digest"
     prompt: "Create a skim digest for [project-path]"
     ```
  4. Then read the digest file for chapter data
- For smaller projects: scan directly (first 1-2 paragraphs, word counts, status)

**Check Supporting Directories:**
- builds/ — Most recent build date
- covers/ — Cover iterations, final cover.png
- critiques/ — Most recent critique date
- synopses/ — Most recent synopsis date

### 2. Assess and Recommend

After loading, use the next agent to assess status and suggest what to do:

```
Task tool with subagent_type: "fiction:next"
prompt: "Assess project status and suggest next steps for: [project-path]"
```

### 3. Output

Output the combined result:

```markdown
