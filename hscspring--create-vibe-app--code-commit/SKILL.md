# Code Commit

Create well-structured git commits with meaningful messages.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Types

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring |
| `test` | Adding tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance |

## Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add user login functionality

Implement JWT-based authentication with:
- Login endpoint
- Token validation

Closes #123
```

```bash
fix(api): handle null response in user query
```

## Rules

1. **Atomic** - One logical change per commit
2. **Present tense** - "add" not "added"
3. **50/72** - Subject ≤50, body wrapped at 72
4. **Reference issues** - `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`
