name: frontend-design
description: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use when building or styling web UI (pages, dashboards, forms, React components, Tailwind layouts) and when the user asks to beautify a frontend. Prioritize accessible, polished, context-appropriate UI (especially for clinical/medical apps). Use when this capability is needed.

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

# ClinicalFlow default (when building EHR / medical UI)

If the UI is for **healthcare/clinical workflows**:

- Optimize for **legibility, speed, and low cognitive load** (not “flash”).
- Prefer **calm palettes**, strong hierarchy, generous spacing, and predictable layouts.
- Use motion sparingly; avoid distracting animations in primary workflows.
- **Accessibility is non-negotiable**: high contrast, clear focus states, keyboard navigation, readable font sizes.
- Never display or log real PHI/secrets; use mock/demo data in UI examples unless the user provides otherwise.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that match the product context. For consumer/brand experiences, prefer distinctive, characterful pairings. For clinical/pro tools, **high-legibility fonts are acceptable and often best** (e.g., Inter/Source Sans 3) — differentiate with hierarchy, spacing, and tone rather than novelty fonts.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics: cliched color schemes (especially “purple gradient on white”), predictable cookie-cutter layouts, and components that lack context-specific character. (Note: Inter/system fonts are fine when they fit the product context—don’t ban them universally.)

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: commit to a clear vision and execute it precisely. When the context is clinical, the “vision” is usually *calm, fast, and trustworthy* rather than edgy.
