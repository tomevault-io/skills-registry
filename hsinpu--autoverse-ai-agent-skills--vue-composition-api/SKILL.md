# Vue Composition API

Use this skill for Vue 3 component logic and composables. Pair with `vue-development` for broader application structure, `vue-debug-guides` for runtime failures, and `nuxt-development` for Nuxt-specific conventions.

## Defaults

- Prefer `<script setup lang="ts">` for SFCs.
- Prefer Composition API over Options API for new code.
- Keep props immutable; derive local state explicitly when editable local copies are required.
- Use `computed` for derived values and `watch` only for side effects or async reactions.
- Use `shallowRef` for large objects, external library instances, DOM-ish objects, or data where deep reactivity is unnecessary.

## SFC Macros

- Type `defineProps` and `defineEmits` directly; avoid duplicating runtime and type declarations unless runtime validation is needed.
- Use `withDefaults` for optional prop defaults when not relying on framework-supported destructure defaults.
- Use `defineModel` for component `v-model` contracts; name the model when the component exposes multiple models.
- Use `defineExpose` only for deliberate public instance APIs, not as a shortcut around prop/event design.
- Use `defineSlots` when slot props matter for TypeScript users.

## Reactivity Choices

- Use `ref` for primitives and replaceable values.
- Use `reactive` for cohesive mutable objects that are not routinely destructured.
- Use `toRef` / `toRefs` when exposing properties from a reactive object without losing reactivity.
- Use `readonly` for state returned from composables when callers should not mutate internals.
- Avoid destructuring reactive objects unless converted to refs first.

## Watchers

- Prefer `watch(source, callback)` when the dependency is specific and the callback performs a side effect.
- Prefer `watchEffect` only when automatic dependency collection makes the code simpler and still obvious.
- Clean up async effects with watcher cleanup APIs or an abort signal.
- Set `flush: 'post'` only when the effect needs the updated DOM.
- Avoid deep watchers on large objects; watch a smaller source or normalize the state shape.

## Composables

- Name composables with `useX` and keep them framework-facing, not component-specific dumping grounds.
- Accept refs, getters, or plain values when useful; normalize with `toValue`.
- Return stable, typed state and functions; avoid returning giant mutable bags.
- Register lifecycle hooks inside composables only when they are meant to be called during component setup.
- Keep network, storage, timers, and subscriptions cancelable or disposable.

## Avoid

- Mutating props directly.
- Mirroring props into local refs without a synchronization rule.
- Using watchers for values that should be `computed`.
- Creating composables that depend on hidden global singletons unless that is the intended app boundary.
- Using deep reactive state for large immutable payloads.
