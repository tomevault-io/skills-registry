# Vue Testing

Use this skill when Vue behavior needs test coverage or a Vue test is failing. Pair with `testing-strategy` for test-level choices, `pinia-state-management` for store design, and `webapp-testing` for local browser verification.

## Test Level Choices

- Use Vitest unit tests for pure composables, formatters, validators, stores, and component logic with limited DOM needs.
- Use Vue Test Utils component tests for emitted events, slots, conditional rendering, forms, and parent-child contracts.
- Use Playwright for routing flows, real browser APIs, accessibility-critical interactions, visual regressions, and cross-page behavior.
- Prefer behavior-focused assertions over snapshots as the only signal.

## Component Tests

- Mount the component through public inputs: props, slots, global plugins, route state, and user events.
- Assert visible DOM, emitted events, navigation effects, and store/API outcomes rather than internal refs.
- Use `findBy`/semantic queries where available; avoid brittle class and implementation selectors unless they are stable test hooks.
- Stub heavy child components only when their behavior is irrelevant to the parent contract.
- Keep tests resilient to component internals so refactors do not rewrite the suite.

## Async Behavior

- Await user events, `nextTick`, and pending promises before asserting async DOM updates.
- Use `flushPromises` when the component awaits external promises or mocked API calls.
- Avoid fixed sleeps; wait for a specific UI state or promise boundary.
- Test loading, success, empty, error, cancellation, and retry states when the component fetches data.

## Pinia And Plugins

- Install Pinia in tests before mounting components that call stores.
- Use `@pinia/testing` when component tests should mock actions and focus on rendering or interaction.
- Use a real Pinia store when testing store behavior, getters, subscriptions, or cross-store interactions.
- Reset store state between tests; do not rely on execution order.

## Composables

- Test pure composables directly when they do not use lifecycle hooks, provide/inject, or component instance APIs.
- Use a tiny wrapper component when a composable needs lifecycle, injection, route context, or plugin context.
- Expose only the state needed for assertions from the wrapper.

## Suspense, Teleport, And Async Components

- Wrap async setup components in `Suspense` and await resolution before asserting resolved content.
- Query teleported content from `document.body` or the configured teleport target, not only from the wrapper.
- Mock dynamic imports only when testing the parent boundary; otherwise await the real async component.

## Avoid

- Testing private component variables instead of observable behavior.
- Snapshot-only coverage for interactive components.
- Global mocks that leak across tests.
- Testing Vue Router, Pinia, or browser APIs through hand-rolled mocks when a real plugin or browser runner is more reliable.
