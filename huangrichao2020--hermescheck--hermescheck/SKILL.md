description: Audit a NousResearch/hermes-agent checkout or fork for Hermes-specific runtime-contract drift, command-surface splits, memory/skill/gateway health, and agent architecture risks. Uses the hermescheck Python library (hermescheck.report.v1) for structured reports with severity-ranked findings and code-first fix plans. Use when this capability is needed.

# Hermes Agent Health Check

Audit the architecture and health of a Hermes Agent checkout, fork, or deployment support repo.

Hermes Agent has a connected runtime: agent loop, command registry, CLI, TUI, gateway, skills, memory, cron, tools, plugins, and terminal environments. `hermescheck` helps keep those surfaces aligned.

## When to Use

- You are preparing a Hermes Agent PR and want a repeatable architecture review
- A Hermes fork works in CLI but not gateway, TUI, skills, cron, or plugins
- A new slash command risks drifting across surfaces
- A tool or environment change needs clearer capability boundaries
- Memory, session search, or skill behavior regressed after a refactor
- Startup paths or background jobs became hard to reason about

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install hermescheck
hermescheck /path/to/hermes-agent
```

Produces `audit_results.json` and `audit_report.md`.

## The 12-Layer Stack

| # | Layer | What Goes Wrong |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | System prompt | Conflicting instructions, instruction bloat |
| 2 | Session history | Stale context from previous turns |
| 3 | Long-term memory | Pollution across sessions |
| 4 | Distillation | Compressed artifacts re-entering as pseudo-facts |
| 5 | Active recall | Redundant re-summary layers wasting context |
| 6 | Tool selection | Wrong tool routing, model skips required tools |
| 7 | Tool execution | Hallucinated execution — claims to call but doesn't |
| 8 | Tool interpretation | Misread or ignored tool output |
| 9 | Answer shaping | Format corruption in final response |
| 10 | Platform rendering | UI/API/CLI mutates valid answers |
| 11 | Hidden repair loops | Silent fallback/retry agents running second LLM pass |
| 12 | Persistence | Expired state or cached artifacts reused as live evidence |

## Audit Scanners

| # | Scanner | Severity | What It Catches |
|---|---------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Hardcoded Secrets | critical | API keys, tokens, credentials in source code |
| 2 | Tool Enforcement Gap | high | "Must use tool X" in prompt but no code validation |
| 3 | Hidden LLM Calls | high | Secret second-pass LLM calls in fallback/repair loops |
| 4 | Unrestricted Code Execution | critical | exec(), eval(), subprocess(shell=True) without sandbox |
| 5 | Static Bug Inference | high | Code-level bug patterns inferred without runtime execution |
| 6 | Token Usage Budget | high | Large default context windows, full-history prompts, missing thrift controls |
| 7 | Memory Lifecycle Governance | medium | Memory without types, lifecycle, retrieval budgets, decay, or evidence pointers |
| 8 | RAG Pipeline Governance | medium | Retrieval without chunk, top-k, rerank, ingestion, or context budget controls |
| 9 | Self-Evolution Capability | high | Learning loops without external signals, source reading, constraint fit, safe landing, or verification |
| 10 | Loop Safety Budget | high | Tool/agent loops without max-iteration, retry budget, stuck-job, or duplicate-call controls |
| 11 | Plugin / Remote Tool Boundary | high | Executable plugins and MCP/OpenAPI tools without sandbox, schema, allowlist, or approval boundaries |
| 12 | Output Pipeline Mutation | medium | Response transformation corrupting correct answers |
| 13 | Missing Observability | medium | No tracing, logging, cost tracking, or audit trail |

## Severity Model

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `critical` | Agent can confidently produce wrong operational behavior |
| `high` | Agent frequently degrades correctness or stability |
| `medium` | Correctness usually survives but output is fragile or wasteful |
| `low` | Mostly cosmetic or maintainability issues |

## Fix Strategy

Default fix order (code-first, not prompt-first):

1. **Code-gate tool requirements** — enforce in code, not just prompt text
2. **Remove or narrow hidden repair agents** — make fallback explicit with contracts
3. **Reduce context duplication** — same info through prompt + history + memory + distillation
4. **Tighten memory admission** — user corrections > agent assertions
5. **Tighten distillation triggers** — don't compress what shouldn't be compressed
6. **Reduce rendering mutation** — pass-through, don't transform
7. **Convert to typed JSON envelopes** — structured internal flow, not freeform prose

## Report Schema

Reports follow a formal JSON Schema (see `references/report-schema.json`) with:
- `overall_health`: critical_risk | high_risk | medium_risk | low_risk
- `findings`: array of severity-ranked issues with evidence refs
- `maturity_score`: positive signal ledger, penalty ledger, score formula, and expected recovery directions
- `ordered_fix_plan`: prioritized fix steps with rationale

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Saying "the model is weak" without falsifying the wrapper first
- ❌ Saying "memory is bad" without showing the contamination path
- ❌ Letting a clean current state erase a dirty historical incident
- ❌ Treating markdown prose as a trustworthy internal protocol
- ❌ Accepting "must use tool" in prompt text when code never enforces it
