# Git Commit Creation and Splitting Guidelines

## Commit Message Format (Conventional Commits v1.0.0)

All commit messages follow the Conventional Commits format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Quick Reference

| Type | When to use | SemVer |
|------|-------------|--------|
| feat | New feature or capability | MINOR |
| fix | Bug fix | PATCH |
| refactor | Code restructuring, no behavior change | - |
| docs | Documentation only | - |
| style | Formatting, whitespace, no logic change | - |
| perf | Performance improvement | - |
| test | Adding or correcting tests | - |
| build | Build system or dependency changes | - |
| ci | CI/CD configuration changes | - |
| chore | Maintenance tasks (no src/test change) | - |

### Key Rules

- **Type**: Lowercase noun from the table above
- **Scope** (optional): Module or component in parentheses — `fix(parser):`
- **Description**: Lowercase start, imperative mood ("add" not "added"), no trailing period
- **Breaking change**: Add `!` before colon — `feat!:` or `feat(api)!:`

### Examples

```
feat: add user authentication via OAuth2
fix(parser): handle null input in token validation
refactor: extract validation logic into shared module
docs: update API endpoint documentation for v2
feat!: redesign configuration format
```

**Multi-line example:**
```
fix(auth): prevent session fixation on login

Regenerate session ID after successful authentication
to prevent session fixation attacks.

Closes #1234
```

## Workflow: Single Commit

For cases where the user wants to commit all current changes as a single commit:

1. Run `git diff --stat` and `git diff` to understand what changed
2. Determine the appropriate commit type from the Quick Reference table
3. Identify scope if changes are concentrated in a specific module
4. Draft a commit message following the Conventional Commits format above
5. Present the proposed message to the user for confirmation
6. Execute `git add` and `git commit` with user-approved message

---

## Workflow: Splitting Changes into Multiple Commits

### Phase 1: Understanding Changes

*   **Goal**: Identify and understand all changes to plan commits on a file-by-file basis.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Analyze the `git diff` provided by the user.
    *   Integrate any additional context (issue tracker IDs, work descriptions, feature branch names).
    *   **Identify work units strictly on a file basis — each file belongs to only one commit.** Related files can be bundled into a single commit after discussion with the user, but there must be no overlap between commits.
    *   If the diff is large or file-based splitting is ambiguous, ask clear questions before proceeding. Example: "The changes in file A and file B appear to be closely related. Should we bundle these into one commit, or separate them?"

### Phase 2: Planning Commit Structure

*   **Goal**: Propose a structured list of atomic commits, each with a clear Conventional Commits message.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   For each proposed commit:
        *   List the specific files and changed hunks to include.
        *   Draft a commit message following the Conventional Commits format:
            *   **Subject**: `<type>[scope]: <description>` — imperative mood, under 50 characters preferred
            *   **Body** (optional, recommended for complex changes): Explain "what" and "why", not "how". Reference issue IDs where applicable.
    *   Present the complete plan as a numbered list for review.

### Phase 3: Incorporating Feedback

*   **Goal**: Collaboratively refine the commit plan.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Review user feedback on groupings and messages.
    *   Adjust as needed: regroup changes, modify messages, add or remove commits.
    *   Present the revised plan and repeat until the user explicitly confirms.
    *   **Do not proceed with any `git commit` operations during this phase.** Wait for explicit user instruction.

### Phase 4: Commit Execution

*   **Goal**: Execute commits sequentially according to the approved plan.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Only after the user explicitly commands to proceed:
        *   For each planned commit, one by one in agreed order:
            *   Announce the commit being created (e.g., "Creating commit: `refactor(db): simplify connection pooling`").
            *   Stage files with `git add <file1> <file2>...` and wait for user approval.
            *   If the user wants to stage only specific hunks, guide them to use `git add -p <file>` directly.
            *   Execute `git commit -m "subject line" -m "body content..."` with the planned message and wait for user approval.
            *   After confirming success (e.g., `git log -1`), proceed to the next commit.
    *   If errors occur or the user wants changes midway, return to Phase 3.

## General Principles

*   **User Control**: The user is always in control. Suggest and guide, but the user makes decisions and approves critical commands.
*   **Clarity and Precision**: All suggestions, file lists, and commands must be clear and accurate.
*   **Atomicity**: Each commit represents a single logical unit of work.
*   **Context Awareness**: If aware of project-specific commit message formats or conventions (e.g., from `CONTRIBUTING.md` or existing commit history), integrate this knowledge.
*   **Confirmed Execution**: Repository-changing operations (`git add`, `git commit`) are executed only after proposing the command and receiving explicit user approval.
*   **Hook Respect**: Do not skip git hooks (`-n`, `--no-verify`) unless the user explicitly requests it. If a pre-commit hook fails, diagnose the error, report it to the user, and suggest options: fix the issue or skip hooks if the user confirms.
