# Memory Reflection Skill

Reflect on recent experiences and consolidate learnings to maintain organized, useful memory.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Starting a new day or session
- Completing significant conversations
- Noticing cluttered or disorganized memory

## Reflection Process

1. **Review Recent Events**
   - Call `mcp__memory__list` on `/events/` to retrieve recent activity
   - Identify patterns, recurring topics, or themes

2. **Identify Key Learnings**
   - Extract new information discovered
   - Note preferences or patterns that emerged from user interactions
   - Assess what worked well and what did not

3. **Update Identity/State**
   - Promote important learnings to `/state/` layer
   - Update `/identity/` when core understanding has evolved

4. **Consolidate User Knowledge**
   - Review `/users/{userId}/` entries
   - Merge related observations about each user

5. **Clean Up**
   - Remove redundant event entries
   - Archive information that has been consolidated

## Output

Summarize after reflection:
- Key learnings consolidated
- Memories archived or removed
- Areas needing more information
