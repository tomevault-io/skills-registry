## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Generate a SITREP

**Mandatory Triggers:**
1. **Phase Transitions**: At the start/end of each project phase
2. **Daily Standups**: For active sprints (morning summary)
3. **Blocker Escalations**: When critical issues arise
4. **Handoff Events**: When transferring work between agents/people
5. **Milestone Completion**: Upon completing major deliverables
6. **Status Requests**: When stakeholders request updates

**Optional Triggers:**
1. **Mid-Phase Check-ins**: 50% completion mark
2. **Risk Identification**: When new risks are discovered
3. **Scope Changes**: When requirements or priorities shift
4. **Resource Changes**: When team/tool availability changes

### Status Color Coding

**🟢 GREEN (On Track):**
- All tasks progressing as planned
- No blockers or risks
- Quality gates passing
- Timeline intact
- Resources adequate

**🟡 YELLOW (Caution):**
- Minor delays or issues
- Manageable blockers
- Some quality concerns
- Timeline at risk but recoverable
- Resources stretched but adequate

**🔴 RED (Critical):**
- Major blockers preventing progress
- Significant quality issues
- Timeline severely at risk
- Resources insufficient
- Escalation required

### Authorization Code Format

```text
[PROJECT]-[PHASE]-[AGENT]-[SEQUENCE]

Examples:
HUMMBL-MCP-CASCADE-001
HUMMBL-API-CHATGPT-003
UNIFIED-TIER-CLAUDE-DESK-012
```

**Components:**
- **PROJECT**: Project identifier (uppercase, max 15 chars)
- **PHASE**: Current phase/component (uppercase, max 10 chars)
- **AGENT**: Agent/operator identifier (uppercase, max 10 chars)
- **SEQUENCE**: 3-digit sequential number

### Handoff Protocol

**Sending Agent Responsibilities:**
1. Generate comprehensive SITREP
2. Include authorization code
3. Specify receiving agent explicitly
4. Document all context needed
5. State clear next actions
6. Confirm handoff acceptance

**Receiving Agent Responsibilities:**
1. Acknowledge receipt with auth code
2. Validate context completeness
3. Request clarification if needed
4. Confirm acceptance of tasking
5. Provide ETA for next SITREP

**Handoff Template:**
```markdown
## HANDOFF TO [AGENT]

**Task:** [Clear task statement]  
**Context:** [All necessary background]  
**Deliverables:** [Expected outputs]  
**Timeline:** [Deadline or ETA]  
**Resources:** [What receiver has access to]  
**Success Criteria:** [How to know task is complete]  
**Auth Code:** [HANDOFF-CODE]

**Receiving agent confirms:**
[ ] Context understood
[ ] Resources accessible
[ ] Timeline acceptable
[ ] Success criteria clear
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Handoff
**Use Case:** Tasks that must be completed in order

```text
Agent A → SITREP → Agent B → SITREP → Agent C
```

**SITREP Focus:**
- Clear completion criteria for each agent
- Explicit dependencies documented
- Context preservation through chain
- Quality gates between handoffs

### Pattern 2: Parallel Execution
**Use Case:** Independent tasks executed simultaneously

```text
Coordinator → SITREP → Agent A
                     → Agent B
                     → Agent C
         
[All report back to Coordinator]
```

**SITREP Focus:**
- No inter-agent dependencies
- Independent completion tracking
- Aggregated status reporting
- Coordination of merge points

### Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement
**Use Case:** Multiple passes for quality improvement

```text
Agent A → SITREP → Agent B (Review)
   ↑                    ↓
   └────── Iterate ─────┘
```

**SITREP Focus:**
- Iteration count tracking
- Quality improvement metrics
- Diminishing returns detection
- Exit criteria definition

### Pattern 4: Escalation Chain
**Use Case:** Decision authority hierarchy

```text
Agent A → Blocker → SITREP → Team Lead
                              ↓
                         SITREP → Executive
```

**SITREP Focus:**
- Escalation justification
- Impact assessment
- Decision options presented
- Urgency indicators

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Information Overload
**Problem:** SITREP too long, recipients skim and miss critical info  
**Solution:** Use "Executive Summary" section for key points, details below

### Pitfall 2: Unclear Status
**Problem:** Status indicator doesn't match blocker severity  
**Solution:** Follow strict color coding rules; default to more conservative

### Pitfall 3: Missing Context
**Problem:** Handoff fails because receiver lacks necessary background  
**Solution:** Include "Context" section with all assumptions and background

### Pitfall 4: No Clear Next Steps
**Problem:** Recipients unsure what to do after reading SITREP  
**Solution:** Always include "Next Actions" with specific, actionable items

### Pitfall 5: Stale Information
**Problem:** SITREP outdated by the time stakeholders read it  
**Solution:** Include timestamp and "Valid Until" field for time-sensitive reports

## Resources

- **Military SITREP Format**: FM 6-99.2 (U.S. Army Field Manual)
- **Agile Status Reporting**: Scrum Daily Stand-up best practices
- **Incident Management**: ITIL incident reporting standards
- **Project Management**: PMI status reporting guidelines

## Success Criteria

**Effective SITREP achieves:**
1. ✅ Stakeholders understand status in <2 minutes reading time
2. ✅ No follow-up questions needed for clarification
3. ✅ Handoffs execute without context loss
4. ✅ Blockers escalated to correct authority
5. ✅ Next actions clear enough to execute immediately

**SITREP fails if:**
1. ❌ Recipients request clarification on basic facts
2. ❌ Status doesn't match actual project state
3. ❌ Handoffs fail due to missing context
4. ❌ Timeline estimates consistently wrong
5. ❌ Blockers not identified until crisis point
