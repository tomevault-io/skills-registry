# Transformation Workflow Skill

Practical guide for applying HUMMBL's 6 transformations to real-world problems. Provides step-by-step workflows, combination patterns, templates, and examples for effective mental model usage.

## Overview

The 6 HUMMBL transformations represent different cognitive operations:

1. **Perspective (P):** Frame and name what is
2. **Inversion (IN):** Reverse assumptions  
3. **Composition (CO):** Combine parts into wholes
4. **Decomposition (DE):** Break wholes into components
5. **Recursion (RE):** Iterate, feedback, self-reference
6. **Meta-Systems (SY):** Coordinate systems-of-systems

3. **Run premortem** (IN8)
   - Assume total failure in 6 months
   - Why did it fail?
   - What went wrong?
4. **Apply via negativa** (IN3)
   - What should we STOP doing?
   - What to remove, not add?
5. **Seek disconfirmation** (IN15)
   - What evidence contradicts our plan?
   - Who disagrees and why?

**Output Format:**
```markdown
## Inversion Analysis

│  [System Component 2]           │
│    ↓ ↑                          │
│  [System Component 3]           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

**Interconnections:**
- [A] affects [B] via [mechanism]
- [B] affects [C] via [mechanism]
- [C] feeds back to [A] via [mechanism]

**Second-Order Analysis:**
| Action | 1st Order | 2nd Order | 3rd Order |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| [Action 1] | [Direct effect] | [Effect of effect] | [Further effect] |
| [Action 2] | [Direct effect] | [Effect of effect] | [Further effect] |

**Leverage Points** (Highest to Lowest Impact):
1. **[Point 1]:** [Why high leverage]
2. **[Point 2]:** [Why medium leverage]
3. **[Point 3]:** [Why low leverage]

**Unintended Consequences:**

- Secondary: [Model code + name]
- Why: [Justification]

**Recommended Strategy:**
- [Strategic approach based on analysis]
```

**Example:** Market expansion decision
- **Systems View:** Current market, new market, competitors, resources
- **Second-Order:** Enter new market → Spread resources thin → Lose focus in current market → Competitors gain ground
- **Leverage:** Instead of new market, deepen penetration in current (10x ROI)
- **Output:** Stay focused strategy, not expansion

## Combination Patterns

### Pattern 1: P → DE → CO (Understand → Analyze → Build)

**Use Case:** Building new solution  
**Steps:**
1. **Perspective:** Understand problem from multiple angles
2. **Decomposition:** Break down into components
3. **Composition:** Integrate into solution

**Example:** Designing new feature
- P: Stakeholder needs (users want X, business wants Y)
- DE: Break into sub-features, identify dependencies
- CO: Integrate into cohesive feature with good UX

### Pattern 2: P → IN → SY (Frame → Challenge → Strategy)

**Use Case:** Strategic decision  
**Steps:**
1. **Perspective:** Frame the situation
2. **Inversion:** Challenge assumptions
3. **Meta-Systems:** Strategic synthesis

**Example:** Business model pivot
- P: Current model's perspective, customer viewpoint
- IN: What if opposite? What to stop?
- SY: Strategic choice based on systems thinking

### Pattern 3: DE → IN → CO (Analyze → Invert → Rebuild)

**Use Case:** Innovation/redesign  
**Steps:**
1. **Decomposition:** Understand current system
2. **Inversion:** Challenge how it works
3. **Composition:** Build new solution

**Example:** Process improvement
- DE: Map current process, find bottleneck
- IN: What if we removed steps? Did opposite?
- CO: Redesigned process

### Pattern 4: All 6 in Sequence (Complete Analysis)

**Use Case:** Major strategic initiative  
**Steps:**
1. **P:** Frame problem
2. **IN:** Challenge assumptions
3. **DE:** Analyze components
4. **CO:** Build solution
5. **RE:** Plan iteration
6. **SY:** Strategic integration

**Example:** Company transformation
- Use all 6 transformations systematically
- Comprehensive, robust analysis
- Takes longer but minimizes blind spots

### Pattern 5: RE wrapping any other (Iterative Application)

**Use Case:** Continuous improvement  
**Structure:** RE(P/IN/CO/DE/SY)

**Example:** Product development
- Week 1: P (understand users)
- Week 2: DE (analyze feedback)
- Week 3: CO (build improvements)
- Week 4: RE (iterate based on results)
- Repeat

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Using Wrong Transformation

**Error:** Applying Decomposition when need Perspective  
**Symptom:** Breaking down problem doesn't help because problem not understood  
**Solution:** Start with P (frame first), then DE (analyze)

### Pitfall 2: Skipping Inversion

**Error:** Going straight to solution without challenging assumptions  
**Symptom:** Conventional thinking, missing creative options  
**Solution:** Always apply IN before finalizing approach

### Pitfall 3: Decomposition Without Recomposition

**Error:** Breaking things down but never synthesizing  
**Symptom:** Analysis paralysis, no actionable solution  
**Solution:** DE must be followed by CO (analyze then build)

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Feedback Loops

**Error:** Linear thinking in dynamic system  
**Symptom:** Interventions don't work as expected  
**Solution:** Apply RE to understand dynamics

### Pitfall 5: Local Optimization

**Error:** Optimizing parts without seeing whole  
**Symptom:** Suboptimization, missing systemic issues  
**Solution:** Use SY (systems view) before optimizing

### Pitfall 6: Single-Model Thinking

**Error:** Using only one model/transformation  
**Symptom:** One-dimensional analysis, blind spots  
**Solution:** Combine multiple transformations (patterns above)

### Pitfall 7: Overcomplication

**Error:** Applying all 6 when 2 would suffice  
**Symptom:** Slow progress, diminishing returns  
**Solution:** Start simple (1-2 transformations), add if needed

## Transformation Selection Flowchart

```text
START: What's your primary need?

├─ "Understand the problem"
│  → Use PERSPECTIVE (P)
│  → Then consider: DE (analyze) or IN (challenge)

├─ "Stuck or need creativity"
│  → Use INVERSION (IN)
│  → Then consider: P (reframe) or CO (rebuild)

├─ "Build/integrate solution"
│  → Use COMPOSITION (CO)
│  → Likely needed: DE first (analyze parts)

├─ "Analyze complex system"
│  → Use DECOMPOSITION (DE)
│  → Then consider: CO (reintegrate) or SY (systems view)

├─ "Handle dynamics/feedback"
│  → Use RECURSION (RE)
│  → Then consider: SY (systemic) or DE (analyze loops)

└─ "Strategic/systemic decision"
   → Use META-SYSTEMS (SY)
   → Then consider: P (perspectives) + IN (challenge)
```
