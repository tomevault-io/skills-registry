description: Ensure we're on a feature or bug branch. If current branch is mainline (main, master, dev) or a release branch (release/*), create and checkout a new branch. Use when a workflow or user request should avoid committing or pushing directly to mainline or release. Use when this capability is needed.

# Ensure Feature Branch Skill

Ensure the current branch is a feature or bug branch. If it is a mainline or release branch, create and checkout a new branch so commits are not made on mainline/release. Use this skill on its own or as part of any automation (e.g. pre-commit hook, command, or manual request).

## When to Use

- Use when you need to ensure work is not committed or pushed directly to mainline or release
- Use when the user asks to commit/push and the current branch is main, master, dev, or release/*
- Use in any workflow that requires a feature/bug branch before subsequent steps (e.g. stage, commit, push)

## Mainline and Release Branches

Treat these as **not** feature/bug branches; create a new branch if current branch is one of:

- **Mainline**: `main`, `master`, `dev`
- **Release**: Any branch matching `release/*` (e.g. `release/1.0`, `release/2.x`)

Repos may use different default branch names (e.g. `trunk`, `development`). If the repo clearly uses another name as the primary integration branch, treat it as mainline.

## Steps

1. Get current branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. If it is a mainline or release branch (as above), create a new branch and checkout:
   - **Branch name**: Infer from the changes (files/diff) a short kebab-case description. Use `feat/<description>` for features or `fix/<description>` for fixes. If the change type is unclear, use `feat/<description>` or a neutral `chore/<description>`.
   - Run: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
3. If already on a feature/bug branch (e.g. `feat/...`, `fix/...`, or any branch not mainline/release), do nothing and proceed.

## Notes

- When used in a multi-step flow (e.g. before stage → commit → push), run this first so the first commit lands on the new branch.
- Do not create a branch if already on a non-mainline, non-release branch (e.g. existing `feat/xyz` or an updatecli branch).
