# Stage Related Files Skill

Group changes logically for `git add` and decide when to split into one or more commits.

## When to Use

- Use when staging files for commit or when grouping related changes into logical commits
- Use when deciding whether to make one commit or several
- Use in any workflow that requires staging (e.g. commit workflows, hooks, commands)

## Instructions

### Grouping Criteria

Group by **logical change**: one feature/fix/docs refactor per commit when possible.

- **Same type of change**: Same scope (e.g. one area of codebase), no unrelated edits in one commit
- **When to split**: Separate commits for distinct features, fixes, or doc-only vs code

### Steps

1. Run `git status` to see modified, added, and deleted files
2. **Exclude research documents and plan files** from staging:
   - Files matching `*research*.md` (e.g. `docs/cloud-build-cache-research.md`)
   - Files matching `plan*.txt` or `*.plan.md`
   - These are one-off documents created during tasks and should not be committed
3. Propose groupings (paths or patterns) based on the criteria above, excluding the research/plan files
4. For each group, run `git add <paths>`. Avoid staging everything in one blob unless it truly is one logical change
5. Run `git status` again to verify what is staged (confirm research/plan files are not included)

### Single vs Multiple Commits

- **Single**: All changes are one logical unit — use one `git add` for the full set
- **Multiple**: If the working tree has clearly separate logical changes, do multiple `git add` + commit cycles (group 1 → add → commit, then group 2 → add → commit)
