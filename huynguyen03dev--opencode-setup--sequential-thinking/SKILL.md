name: sequential-thinking
description: Dynamic problem-solving through structured sequential thoughts. Use when breaking down complex problems, planning multi-step solutions, analyzing ambiguous requirements, debugging intricate issues, exploring design alternatives, or tackling problems where the full scope is unclear. Enables thought revision, branching, and iterative refinement. Use when this capability is needed.

# Sequential Thinking

## Overview

This skill provides structured sequential thinking for complex problem-solving through a dynamic, reflective thought process. Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

## When to Use

- Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where full scope is unclear initially
- Multi-step solutions requiring maintained context
- Filtering irrelevant information from complex scenarios
- Debugging intricate issues requiring systematic exploration

## Script Location

The script is located at: `~/.config/opencode/skills/sequential-thinking/scripts/sequential-thinking.ts`

Use `$SKILL_DIR` or the full path when invoking from any directory.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Initialize Thinking

Start a thinking sequence by estimating total thoughts needed:

```bash
bun ~/.config/opencode/skills/sequential-thinking/scripts/sequential-thinking.ts sequentialthinking \
  --thought "Initial analysis of the problem..." \
  --thought-number 1 \
  --total-thoughts 5 \
  --next-thought-needed true
```

### 2. Continue Sequence

Build on previous thoughts, adjusting estimates as needed:

```bash
bun ~/.config/opencode/skills/sequential-thinking/scripts/sequential-thinking.ts sequentialthinking \
  --thought "Building on insight from step 1..." \
  --thought-number 2 \
  --total-thoughts 5 \
  --next-thought-needed true
```

### 3. Revise Previous Thinking

When reconsidering earlier conclusions:

```bash
bun ~/.config/opencode/skills/sequential-thinking/scripts/sequential-thinking.ts sequentialthinking \
  --thought "Reconsidering step 2, I realize..." \
  --thought-number 4 \
  --total-thoughts 6 \
  --is-revision true \
  --revises-thought 2 \
  --next-thought-needed true
```

### 4. Branch Exploration

Explore alternative approaches:

```bash
bun ~/.config/opencode/skills/sequential-thinking/scripts/sequential-thinking.ts sequentialthinking \
  --thought "Alternative approach from step 3..." \
  --thought-number 5 \
  --total-thoughts 7 \
  --branch-from-thought 3 \
  --branch-id "alternative-approach" \
  --next-thought-needed true
```

### 5. Complete Thinking

Conclude when solution is verified:

```bash
bun ~/.config/opencode/skills/sequential-thinking/scripts/sequential-thinking.ts sequentialthinking \
  --thought "Final verified conclusion..." \
  --thought-number 6 \
  --total-thoughts 6 \
  --next-thought-needed false
```

## Key Features

- **Adjustable estimates**: Modify `totalThoughts` up/down as understanding evolves
- **Thought revision**: Mark thoughts as revisions with `--is-revision` and `--revises-thought`
- **Branching**: Explore alternatives with `--branch-from-thought` and `--branch-id`
- **Non-linear thinking**: Branch or backtrack as needed
- **Hypothesis verification**: Generate and verify solution hypotheses iteratively

## Parameters Reference

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--thought` | Yes | Current thinking step content |
| `--thought-number` | Yes | Current position in sequence (1-based) |
| `--total-thoughts` | Yes | Estimated total thoughts (adjustable) |
| `--next-thought-needed` | Yes | `true` to continue, `false` to conclude |
| `--is-revision` | No | `true` if revising previous thinking |
| `--revises-thought` | No | Which thought number being revised |
| `--branch-from-thought` | No | Branching point thought number |
| `--branch-id` | No | Identifier for the branch |
| `--needs-more-thoughts` | No | Signal more thoughts needed |
