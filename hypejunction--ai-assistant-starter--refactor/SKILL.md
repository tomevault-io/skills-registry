# Refactor

> **Purpose:** Systematic refactoring with planning, pattern detection, and batched execution
> **Phases:** Gather Context → Pattern Analysis → Plan → Execute → Validate → Commit
> **Usage:** `/refactor [scope flags] <refactor description>`

## Iron Laws

1. **NO BEHAVIOR CHANGE WITHOUT APPROVAL** — Refactoring changes structure, not behavior. If the refactor would change what the code does, stop and confirm.
2. **ALL EXISTING TESTS MUST PASS** — After every batch, run tests. If tests fail, the refactor introduced a bug.
3. **BATCH AND VERIFY** — Never change more than 5 files without verifying. Large refactors are done in small, verified increments.
4. **REVERT ON FAILURE** — If a batch breaks tests, revert the entire batch rather than debugging individual changes. Start fresh with a corrected approach.

## When to Use

- Renaming functions, variables, or types across the codebase
- Migrating from one API/pattern to another
- Restructuring directories or modules
- Any change affecting 6+ files

## When NOT to Use

- Changing behavior (adding features) → `/implement`
- Fixing a bug → `/debug`
- 1-5 file changes → `/implement`
- Emergency fix → `/hotfix`

> **Note:** Command examples use `npm` as default. Adapt to the project's package manager per `ai-assistant-protocol` — Project Commands.

## Gate Enforcement

See `ai-assistant-protocol` for valid approval terms and invalid responses.

## Scope Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--files=<paths>` | Limit refactor to specific files/directories |
| `--project=<path>` | Project root for monorepos |

---

## Phase 1: Gather Context

### Step 1.1: Clarify Requirements

Ask: (1) What pattern/code needs to change? (2) Target state? (3) Why? (4) Areas to exclude?

**Wait for user response before exploring code.**

### Step 1.2: Explore and Categorize

Determine refactor type, file count, risk level:

| Scope | Files | Risk | Approach |
|-------|-------|------|----------|
| Small | 1-5 | Low | Direct changes |
| Medium | 6-20 | Medium | Batched with testing |
| Large | 21-50 | High | Phased with checkpoints |
| Massive | 50+ | Critical | Multiple phases |

**Wait for confirmation.**

---

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

### Step 2.1: Find All Occurrences

Search for all instances of the pattern. Present findings (see `references/refactor-templates.md` — Pattern Analysis).

### Step 2.2: Surface Edge Cases

Present edge cases for discussion. **Wait for user guidance.**

---

## Phase 3: Plan

Present the refactor plan summary (see `references/refactor-templates.md` — Plan Summary).

### Step 3.1: Evaluate Direct Change vs. Abstraction Layer

For most refactors, direct changes are fine. However, when a direct rename or change is too risky (high coupling, external API surface, published package), use the **Introduce Abstraction Layer** pattern:

1. **Introduce an abstraction layer** — Create an adapter, wrapper, or re-export that maps the old name/interface to the new one
2. **Migrate consumers to the abstraction** — Update import sites to use the adapter (this can be done incrementally and is safe to pause)
3. **Swap the implementation behind the abstraction** — Replace the old implementation with the new one; consumers are unaffected because they use the adapter
4. **Remove the abstraction if desired** — Once all consumers point to the new implementation, the adapter layer can be removed in a final cleanup pass

This pattern is safer for public APIs, published packages, and widely-used internal interfaces where a single atomic rename would be too disruptive or where the migration must be done incrementally across multiple PRs.

Present the chosen strategy (direct change or abstraction layer) as part of the plan summary.

**GATE: Do NOT begin modifying files until user approves.**

---

## Phase 4: Execute

### Step 4.1: Create Git Savepoint

Before starting any changes:

```bash
git stash push -m "savepoint: before refactor" --include-untracked 2>/dev/null; git stash pop 2>/dev/null
```

Or ensure all current work is committed so you can revert cleanly.

### Step 4.2: Determine Change Order (Phased Refactoring)

Apply refactoring changes in a safe order to catch breakage early:

1. **Type definitions and interfaces first** — These catch downstream breakage at compile time. If a type rename is wrong, the typecheck immediately surfaces every affected file.
2. **Implementation files second** — Guided by type errors from the previous phase. Update services, handlers, and utilities.
3. **Test files last** — Tests verify the refactoring works. Updating them last ensures they validate the final state, not an intermediate one.

Run typecheck after each phase. If the typecheck fails, fix issues in the current phase before proceeding.

### Step 4.3: Group Changes into Batches

For large refactors, group changes into logical batches (max 5 files per batch). Present the batch grouping to the user for approval before executing.

**Grouping strategies:**
- **By dependency layer** (default): types/interfaces -> services/implementations -> routes/handlers -> tests. This ensures each batch is independently type-checkable.
- **By feature area**: When the refactor is cross-cutting (e.g., rename used in auth, billing, and notifications), group by feature so each batch leaves one feature area fully migrated.
- **Mixed**: Use dependency-layer ordering within each feature area for very large refactors.

Each batch should be independently type-checkable — after applying a batch and running typecheck, there should be no new type errors introduced by that batch (existing errors from not-yet-migrated code are expected and acceptable).

See `references/safe-refactoring-patterns.md` for pattern-specific risk and batch safety guidance.

### Step 4.4: Execute Batches

For each batch:
1. Apply changes
2. Run typecheck
3. Run affected tests
4. Report progress

**If tests fail after a batch:** Revert the batch (`git checkout -- [affected-files]`), reassess the approach, and try again with a corrected strategy. Do not debug individual file changes within a broken batch.

### Step 4.5: Handle Discrepancies

If a file doesn't match expected patterns, present discrepancy report. **Wait for user decision.** Don't force the change.

---

## Phase 5: Validate

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test -- {affected-pattern}
npm run test  # Full suite for large refactors
```

### Test Updates Required

- Renamed public API → Update test references
- Changed signatures → Update calls and mocks
- Moved code → Update import paths
- Internal restructure → Existing tests should suffice

Present verification report (see `references/refactor-templates.md` — Verification Report).

**GATE: All tests must pass before proceeding.**

---

## Phase 6: Commit

Present commit message. Refactoring commits should use `refactor:` type and clearly describe what changed structurally.

Keep refactoring commits separate from feature commits. Never mix refactoring and behavior changes in the same commit.

**GATE: Wait for explicit confirmation.**

---

## Principles

1. **Ask, don't assume** — Clarify requirements and edge cases
2. **Get approval before executing** — Never refactor without explicit approval
3. **Preserve behavior** — Refactors should not change functionality
4. **Surface issues early** — Report discrepancies, don't silently skip
5. **Revert freely** — Failed batches get reverted, not debugged
6. **Confirm before committing** — User verification required

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Gate |
|-------|------|
| 1. Gather Context | User confirms scope |
| 2. Pattern Analysis | User guides edge cases |
| 3. Plan | **User approves** |
| 4. Execute | Tests pass per batch |
| 5. Validate | **All tests pass** |
| 6. Commit | **User confirms** |
