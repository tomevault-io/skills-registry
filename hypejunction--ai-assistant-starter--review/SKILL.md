# Review

> **Purpose:** Code review of the current branch against the base branch
> **Mode:** Read-only — do NOT modify files, run tests, or make commits
> **Usage:** `/review [scope flags]`

## Iron Laws

1. **READ EVERYTHING BEFORE JUDGING** — Read all changed files before forming any opinion. Early conclusions from partial reading lead to wrong findings.
2. **EVIDENCE, NOT THEORY** — Every P0/P1 finding must include the specific code and a concrete explanation of why it's a real problem, not a hypothetical one.
3. **CLEAN REVIEWS ARE VALID** — If the code is good, say so. Not finding issues is a legitimate review outcome, not a failure to review thoroughly.

## When to Use

- Before merging a PR
- After completing implementation work
- Reviewing someone else's branch
- Quality check before release

## When NOT to Use

- Security-specific concerns → `/security-review`
- Running validation commands → `/validate`
- Making code changes → `/implement` or `/refactor`
- Investigating a bug → `/debug`

## Constraints

- **Read-only** — Suggestions only, no modifications
- **Acknowledge good patterns** — Not just problems
- **Fresh context recommended** — If you wrote the code, use a separate agent or fresh session to avoid self-confirmation bias

## Scope Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--files=<paths>` | Review specific files instead of full branch diff |
| `--pr=<number>` | Review a specific PR by number |

## Severity + Confidence

| Level | Label | Confidence Required | When to Use |
|-------|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| P0 | Critical | HIGH — confirmed in code | Security vulnerability, data loss, correctness bug |
| P1 | High | HIGH — likely real | Logic error, race condition, performance regression |
| P2 | Medium | MEDIUM — possible | Code smell, maintainability concern |
| P3 | Low | Any | Style, naming, minor suggestion |

**Confidence determines whether to report:**
- **HIGH** — Confirmed by reading code + evidence of real impact → Report
- **MEDIUM** — Pattern is typically problematic but mitigation may exist → Report as "needs verification"
- **LOW** — Theoretical or framework-mitigated → Do not report

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

```bash
git branch --show-current
MAIN_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo "main")
gh pr view --json number,title,body,baseRefName,url 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: Get the Diff

```bash
git diff $MAIN_BRANCH...HEAD --stat
git diff $MAIN_BRANCH...HEAD
```

### Step 3: Validate Scope

- **Empty diff** → Report "No changes found" and exit
- **Large diff (>500 lines)** → Warn user and apply the large diff strategy:
  1. Ask user: "Full review (all files) or focused review (specific areas)?"
  2. If full review, group files by logical area (e.g., API routes, services, tests, config) and review one group at a time
  3. Prioritize security-sensitive files first (auth, API routes, data access layers, middleware)
  4. Track which files have been reviewed — include a running count (e.g., "Reviewed 4/12 files")
  5. Summarize findings per group before moving to the next
- **Mixed-concern changes** (feature + refactor + config) → Flag as candidate for splitting into separate PRs

### Step 4: Review Each File

For each changed file, read the full file for context. Use `references/review-checklist.md` for a comprehensive domain-organized checklist (correctness, security, performance, testing, maintainability, TypeScript/React/API-specific checks).

#### Context-Aware Checklist Loading

Load review checklists based on file types in the diff:

| File Type in Diff | Load Additional Checklists |
|---|---|
| .ts/.tsx (React) | `typescript-guidelines`, `accessibility-review/references/wcag-checklist.md` |
| API routes | `rest-api-guidelines`, `security-review/references/security-checklists.md` |
| Test files (.spec.ts) | `vitest-guidelines`, `tdd/references/testing-anti-patterns.md` |
| Database / ORM files | `prisma-guidelines` |
| Config / env files | `env-config-guidelines` |
| CI / Docker files | `github-actions-guidelines`, `docker-node-guidelines` |

Check:

**Code Quality:** No `any` types, proper typing, correct imports, no lint warnings
**Testing:** Test coverage for new code, meaningful descriptions, proper async handling
**Security (structured check — do not skip):**
- No `eval()`, `new Function()`, or dynamic code execution with external input
- No `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, or `v-html` with unsanitized data
- No raw SQL with string interpolation — parameterized queries or ORM required
- No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials in source files
- No `child_process.exec()` with user-controlled input
- No disabled security controls (`rejectUnauthorized: false`)
- Input validation present at API boundaries (request params, body, headers)
- Auth/authz checks present on protected operations
- No open redirects (redirect URLs validated against allowlist)
- No sensitive data in logs or error messages exposed to users
- No mass assignment — request body should not be passed directly to ORM create/update without field allowlisting (`select` or explicit field mapping)

#### Mitigation Search (before reporting P0/P1)

Before reporting a finding at P0 or P1, search for existing mitigations that may reduce severity or confidence:
- Does the ORM model have field selection (`select`, `pick`) that limits writable fields?
- Is there input validation upstream (e.g., Zod schema, DTO class) that strips unknown fields?
- Is there middleware that filters or sanitizes the request body?
- Is the vulnerable code path gated behind auth/authz that limits who can reach it?
- Does a test explicitly verify the security property (e.g., rejects extra fields)?

If a mitigation exists, adjust confidence accordingly (HIGH to MEDIUM) and note the mitigation in the finding. If no mitigation is found, report at the original severity with HIGH confidence. Do NOT skip the finding just because you are unsure — report it as "needs verification" at MEDIUM confidence if uncertain.

**Performance:** No obvious bottlenecks, efficient data fetching
**General:** No `console.log` in prod, error handling present, no dead code

### Escalation Flags

Flag for explicit discussion even if no bug is found:
- Schema or migration changes
- API contract changes (request/response shape, status codes)
- New dependencies added
- Security-sensitive code (auth, crypto, input handling)
- Infrastructure or CI/CD config changes

### Step 5: Generate Report

```markdown
## Code Review: [Branch Name]

### Summary
[Brief overview of what the changes accomplish]

### P0 Critical
1. **[Issue]** — `file.ts:line` — Confidence: HIGH
   - **Evidence:** [Why real, not theoretical]
   - **Fix:** [Specific remediation]

_(None found — or list findings)_

### P1 High
1. **[Issue]** — `file.ts:line` — Confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM
   - **Evidence:** [Why it matters]
   - **Fix:** [Approach]

### P2 Medium
1. [Issue] — `file.ts:line` — [suggestion]

### P3 Low
1. [Suggestion] — `file.ts:line`

### Positive Notes
- [What was done well]

### Escalation Flags
- [Any flagged items, or "None"]

### Files Reviewed
| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| path/to/file.ts | ✅/🟡/🔴 | Brief note |

### Areas Not Covered
[What couldn't be verified — runtime behavior, external API contracts, business logic]

### Residual Risks
[Risks remaining even after fixing all findings]

---
**Recommendation:** [Approve / Request Changes / Needs Discussion]
```

When providing feedback, use severity labels and the question approach (see `references/review-feedback-patterns.md` for label definitions, tone guidelines, and constructive feedback templates).

### Step 6: Action Menu

```markdown
**What would you like to do?**
1. **Fix all** — Apply fixes for all P0-P2 findings
2. **Fix P0-P1 only** — Critical and high issues only
3. **Fix specific items** — Choose which (e.g., "P0.1, P1.2")
4. **No changes** — Keep as read-only review
```

**GATE: User must select an action before proceeding.**

#### Read-Only / Fix Mode Transition

The review phase (Steps 1-5) is **strictly read-only**. No file modifications, no test runs, no git operations beyond context gathering. If the user selects a fix option from the action menu, transition to **write mode** for the fix phase only:

1. Apply fixes in priority order: P0 first, then P1, then P2
2. After each fix, run typecheck and lint to verify the fix does not introduce new issues
3. If a fix introduces new errors, resolve them before moving to the next finding
4. After all selected fixes are applied, offer to commit the changes

## Acceptance Tests
