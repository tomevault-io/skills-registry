# /alethic-scientific-figure — Scientific Figures

A figure is not a data dump — it is a **graphical interface between people and
data**. Treat every figure as a UI/UX design problem: you have a user (the
reader), a context (journal, slide deck, poster), and a message to transmit
with maximum signal-to-noise ratio.

Above all else, show the data.

These principles are distilled from Rougier, Droettboom & Bourne, "Ten Simple
Rules for Better Figures" (PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014) and Tufte's principles of
graphical excellence. The matplotlib configuration uses a custom AFP
institutional color palette with perceptually optimized ordering.

The user's input is: $ARGUMENTS

**Bundled resources** (read on demand):
- `references/color-palette.md` — Full qualitative cycle, AFP colormaps,
  shade families, semantic shorthand, seaborn fallbacks
- `references/presentation-override.md` — Slide and poster rcParams overrides
- `scripts/register_colormaps.py` — Register all AFP colormaps with matplotlib

## Core Principles

Apply these in order. Each principle constrains downstream decisions.

### 1. Audience First

Before writing a single line of plotting code, determine who will read the
figure. This drives *every* subsequent choice.

| Audience | Design implications |
|---|---|
| Self / collaborators | Dense is fine; shared context assumed |
| Journal reviewers & readers | Self-explanatory; complete axis labels, units, legends |
| Oral presentation | Simplified; thick lines, large fonts, high contrast, no fine detail |
| General public | Single salient message; approximation acceptable; minimal jargon |

When the user doesn't specify, **default to journal-quality**: self-contained,
fully labeled, and readable at single-column width (~3.3 in / 84 mm for Nature).

### 2. One Figure, One Message

Identify the single core message before choosing a plot type. The message
drives everything: which data to include, what to emphasize, what to suppress.
If a figure tries to say two things, it says neither clearly — split it.

Ask yourself (or the user): *"What should the reader conclude at first glance?"*

### 3. Match the Medium

Never reuse the same figure across media without adaptation.

**For papers (long viewing time):**
- Fine detail is acceptable
- Use thin lines (0.5-1 pt), font sizes 7 pt (Nature standard)
- Exploit captions for explanation
- Insets and zoomed panels add value

**For slides (time-limited, viewed from distance):**
- Strip to essentials — fewer curves, fewer ticks, no fine structure
- Thicken everything: lines >= 1.5 pt, fonts >= 14 pt, markers >= 6 pt
- High-contrast colors on dark or light backgrounds
- No vertical text; minimize legend boxes (label curves directly)
- Add visual anchors (colored boxes, dashed reference lines)
- For slide/poster rcParams, read `references/presentation-override.md`

**For posters:**
- Intermediate between paper and slide
- Must be readable at ~1 m distance

### 4. Captions Are Mandatory

Always generate a caption suggestion alongside the figure. A good caption:
- Explains *how to read* the figure (what axes mean, what colors encode)
- Points out the key takeaway
- Provides numerical precision that the graphic cannot convey
- Anticipates reader questions

### 5. Never Trust Defaults — Direct Labeling over Legends

Default settings in any plotting library are generic compromises. The style
block below replaces them with a curated baseline. Beyond that, always verify:

- **Tick density**: Reduce to the minimum needed.
- **Font sizes**: Scale to the medium (7 pt for Nature, >=14 pt for slides).
- **Line widths & marker sizes**: 1.0 pt data, 0.5 pt axes in journal figures.
- **Figure size & aspect ratio**: Set explicitly for the target column width.
- **Legend placement**: Prefer direct annotation on curves over a separate
  legend box. Legends force an eye-travel penalty (data -> legend -> back).
  Place labels at the end of each curve:
  ```python
  ax.text(x[-1], y[-1], "  Series A", va="center", fontsize=7,
          color=line.get_color())
  ```
  For dense plots with overlapping endpoints, use the `adjustText` library
  for automated label placement. Fall back to a legend only when direct
  annotation would create clutter worse than the lookup cost.

### 6. Use Color with Intent

Color is the most powerful — and most abused — visual channel.

**Color assignment strategy (priority order):**
1. **Semantic mapping**: If the data has natural color associations, use them.
   Override the cycle explicitly (e.g. red/blue for hot/cold).
2. **Cycle through the palette**: When no semantics exist, use the AFP color
   cycle in order. The first 6 colors have good mutual contrast.
3. **Highlight by exception**: One colored series among many; rest in light
   gray (`#d0d0d0`).

**Colormap defaults (all AFP maps are CIELAB-linearized):**
- **Sequential**: `viridis` for maximum perceptual uniformity, or AFP
  alternatives (`afp_blue`, `afp_bluegreen`) for brand consistency. All AFP
  sequential maps have uniform L* ramps (Delta-L* RMS < 0.5).
- **Diverging**: `afp_KbOr` (kobalt<->orange, 144 deg hue separation under
  deuteranopia — best CVD safety). Multi-hue options: `afp_BgRo`
  (bluegreen<->redorange) for rich hue variation. Avoid `afp_RdGn` and
  `afp_GnOr` (both fail CVD).
- **Categorical**: AFP qualitative cycle (default) or seaborn `colorblind`.
- **Never use `jet` / `rainbow`** for continuous data.
- See `references/color-palette.md` for the full set (28 maps x 2 with
  reversed `_r` variants), selection guide, and CVD analysis.

To register all AFP colormaps with matplotlib, run:
```python
import sys, os
skill_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))  # adjust as needed
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(skill_dir, "scripts"))
import register_colormaps; register_colormaps.register_all()
```

**Color-blind safety (~8% of males):**
- Avoid red-green as the sole distinguishing pair.
- Supplement qualitative colors with line style or marker shape.
- For full palette hex values, seaborn fallbacks, and CVD analysis, read
  `references/color-palette.md`.

**When there are many (>4) overlapping series**: Ask the user which strategy
to use — small multiples (see below), highlight-by-exception, or full cycle with
legend. Do not assume a default; the best choice depends on the message.

### 7. Do Not Mislead

Show data variation, not design variation. Visual differences should come from
the data, never from gratuitous design choices (varying fonts, line styles for
no reason, inconsistent scales).

**Lie Factor** (Tufte): the ratio of the size of an effect shown in the
graphic to the size of the effect in the data. Honest graphics have a Lie
Factor near 1.0; anything outside 0.95-1.05 warrants scrutiny. Check this
whenever encoding value as visual area, length, or angle.

**Common traps to actively avoid:**
- **Truncated axes**: Bar charts must start at zero. Line plots may truncate
  if zero is meaningless, but label clearly.
- **Area vs. radius**: Map value -> **area**, not value -> radius. The `s`
  parameter in `scatter()` is already points-squared, so pass values directly.
- **Pie charts**: Avoid entirely in scientific contexts. Use bar or dot plots.
- **3D charts**: Avoid for quantitative comparison. Use only for genuine 3D
  data (surface plots of 2D fields).
- **Dual y-axes**: Use with extreme caution. Clearly label and color-code.
- **Aspect ratio manipulation**: Choose ratios that honestly represent
  variability.

### 8. Eliminate Chartjunk — Layering & Separation

Every visual element must earn its place. Remove anything that doesn't carry
information: colored backgrounds, decorative gridlines, redundant labels,
excessive tick marks, 3D effects on 2D data.

**Data density** (Tufte): entries in the data matrix divided by the area of
the graphic. Most published figures are sparse (<10 entries/cm-squared); the best
achieve thousands. After removing chartjunk, ask whether you can *add*
information without adding clutter.

**The 1+1=3 problem** (Tufte, via Albers): two visual elements create a third
perceptual artifact at their boundary. When that artifact is noise rather than
information, the design fails. Actionable in matplotlib:
- Muted gridlines: `color="#d0d0d0"`, `linewidth=0.3`, `zorder=0`
- Reference elements behind data: set `zorder` explicitly
- Confidence bands: `alpha=0.15-0.25`, same color as the parent line
- Spine color lighter than data lines: `ax.spines[...].set_color("#999999")`

### 9. Message Over Aesthetics

Scientific figures serve communication first. Beauty is welcome but never at
the expense of clarity. Follow domain conventions where they exist.

### 10. Use the Right Tool

| Tool | Best for |
|---|---|
| **matplotlib** | Publication-quality 2D; full control; Python ecosystem |
| **seaborn** | Statistical plots with sane defaults on top of matplotlib |
| **pgfplots / TikZ** | LaTeX-native; perfect font matching; programmatic |
| **plotly** | Interactive exploration; web dashboards |
| **R / ggplot2** | Statistical graphics with grammar-of-graphics approach |

When generating code, prefer matplotlib unless the user specifies otherwise.

### 11. Small Multiples

Tufte's most powerful technique for complex data. Repeat the same plot frame
across a grid, varying one parameter per panel. The reader's eye learns the
frame once and then reads the data across panels.

**When to prefer small multiples over overlaid curves:**
- More than 4 series that would overlap or create spaghetti
- The message is "each behaves differently" rather than "compare these two"
- Different panels represent different experimental conditions or time windows

**Implementation:**
```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows, ncols, sharex=True, sharey=True,
                          figsize=(ncols*2.5, nrows*2))
fig.align_ylabels()  # critical for honest visual comparison
```
Shared axes are essential — without them the panels lie about relative
magnitudes. Label only the outer axes to minimize ink. Add a single shared
colorbar or legend outside the grid if needed.

### 12. Micro/Macro Readings

The best graphics work at two scales simultaneously (Tufte, *Envisioning
Information*). At the macro level the reader grasps the overall pattern; at
the micro level they can extract individual data points or values.

Design for both:
- **Macro**: overall line shape, trend direction, dominant features
- **Micro**: `ax.annotate()` for key points (minima, crossings, outliers),
  `ax.inset_axes()` for zoomed regions, minor ticks for interpolation
- Choose line widths and marker sizes that serve both scales — thick enough
  to see trends, thin enough to resolve close points

### 13. Sparklines

Tufte's invention (*Beautiful Evidence*): tiny, word-sized graphics that live
inline with text or inside table cells. A sparkline conveys a trend, range,
or distribution in the space of a word — no axes, no labels, just the data
shape. Underused in scientific papers, but powerful for comparison tables
(e.g., noise spectra across sensor variants, time-series thumbnails in a
parameter sweep).

**Implementation:**
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(1.5, 0.3))
ax.plot(x, y, color="#2e2cb8", linewidth=0.8)
ax.fill_between(x, y, alpha=0.1, color="#2e2cb8")
ax.axis("off")
fig.subplots_adjust(left=0, right=1, top=1, bottom=0)
fig.savefig("sparkline.png", dpi=300, transparent=True)
```
For embedding in LaTeX tables, save as tight PNGs or PDFs and use
`\includegraphics[height=1em]{sparkline.png}`. For multi-row comparison
tables, ensure all sparklines share the same y-limits so visual heights are
comparable across rows.

## Implementation Checklist

Before delivering any figure, verify:

- [ ] Message identifiable at first glance
- [ ] Axes labeled with quantities *and* units
- [ ] Font sizes appropriate for target medium
- [ ] Colors are semantically meaningful where possible
- [ ] Colormap perceptually appropriate (viridis for sequential, no rainbow)
- [ ] Color-blind accessible (or supplemented with line styles / markers)
- [ ] No misleading axis ranges (bar charts start at zero)
- [ ] Chartjunk removed (unnecessary gridlines, backgrounds, decorations)
- [ ] No 1+1=3 artifacts (grid behind data, muted spines, transparent bands)
- [ ] Tick density minimal but sufficient
- [ ] Legend clean or replaced by direct annotation
- [ ] Minor ticks visible on both axes (science style convention)
- [ ] Caption drafted with reading instructions and key takeaway
- [ ] **Revision pass**: Can I remove any element without losing information?
  Can I add any element that increases information density?

## Base Style Configuration

This block merges `scienceplots` styles `science + nature + no-latex` into a
standalone `rcParams.update()` requiring **no external dependencies** beyond
matplotlib. The line color cycle uses the AFP institutional palette.

Apply at the top of every plotting script. Adjust `figure.figsize` for
double-column (6.6 in) or presentation as needed.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```

## Session Tracking

After generating a figure, persist the session for reproducibility.

1. **Project detection**: Same as `/alethic-solve` — check for `.git` in cwd or parents. Use Bash:
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo ""
   ```
   If found, use cwd as `{project_root}` and proceed. If not found, skip session tracking entirely (figures are delivered inline).

2. **Create session directory**: Generate a slug from the figure description (lowercase, strip non-alphanumeric to hyphens, collapse runs, truncate to 40 chars), then:
   ```bash
   HEX=$(head -c2 /dev/urandom | xxd -p)
   SESSION_ID="${SLUG}-$(date +%Y%m%d)-${HEX}"
   SESSION_DIR="{project_root}/.alethic/${SESSION_ID}"
   mkdir -p "${SESSION_DIR}"
   ```

3. **Save files**:
   - Copy the plotting script to `{session_dir}/output.py`
   - Copy the figure file to `{session_dir}/output.{ext}` (pdf, png, or svg)
   - Write `{session_dir}/session.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "schema_version": 1,
     "session_id": "{session_id}",
     "problem": "{figure description}",
     "domain": "figure",
     "skill": "alethic-scientific-figure",
     "status": "completed",
     "output_file": "output.{ext}",
     "created_at": "{ISO 8601 timestamp}",
     "completed_at": "{ISO 8601 timestamp}"
   }
   ```

4. **Append to** `.alethic/sessions.jsonl`:
   ```json
   {"session_id":"{session_id}","problem":"{figure description}","domain":"figure","status":"completed","created_at":"{created_at}","completed_at":"{completed_at}"}
   ```
   Use Bash to append: `echo '{json_line}' >> {project_root}/.alethic/sessions.jsonl`

5. **Print breadcrumb**:
   ```
   **Session:**  `.alethic/{session_id}/`
   **Script:**   `.alethic/{session_id}/output.py`
   **Figure:**   `.alethic/{session_id}/output.{ext}`
   ```

Note: Session tracking is best-effort. If directory creation fails (permissions, non-project context), deliver the figure normally without persisting session state.
