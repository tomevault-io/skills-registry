description: Self-feedback skill that analyzes completed work and improves Claude Code context. Use when asked to "update context", "capture learnings", "improve context", or before compaction. Identifies reusable patterns and delegates to appropriate create skills. Use when this capability is needed.

# Context Updater

Meta-skill for continuous improvement through self-reflection.

## Purpose

After completing tasks, analyze work and:
1. Identify reusable patterns
2. Find gaps in existing context
3. Delegate to appropriate create skills
4. Generate improvement report

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Session

Review conversation for:

```
[ ] Tasks completed
[ ] Problems solved
[ ] Patterns repeated (3+ times = skill candidate)
[ ] External knowledge needed (gap in rules)
[ ] Friction points or mistakes
[ ] Frequently used commands
```

### Step 2: Categorize Findings

| Signal | Category | Delegate To |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Multi-step workflow repeated | Agent | agent-create |
| Reusable 3+ step pattern | Skill | skill-create |
| User-triggered side effect | Command | command-create |
| Convention discovered | Rule | rule-create |
| Deterministic automation needed | Hook | hook-create |
| One-off task | None | Document only |

### Step 3: Check for Duplicates

Before delegating, search existing context:

```bash
# Check for similar patterns
grep -r "{keyword}" claude/agents/ claude/skills/ claude/rules/
ls claude/skills/ claude/agents/
```

### Step 4: Delegate Creation

For each identified improvement, invoke the appropriate skill:

- **New agent needed** → Use agent-create pattern
- **New skill needed** → Use skill-create pattern
- **New command needed** → Use command-create pattern
- **Rule update needed** → Use rule-create pattern
- **Hook needed** → Use hook-create pattern

### Step 5: Generate Report

```markdown
## Context Update Report

### Session Summary
- Tasks: {list of completed tasks}
- Patterns identified: {count}

### Actions Taken

| Type | Name | Action | Reason |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| Skill | {name} | Created | {why} |
| Rule | {file} | Updated | {why} |

### Skipped (No Action)

| Pattern | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| {pattern} | One-off / Too specific / Already exists |

### Manual Follow-ups
- {Any suggestions requiring user decision}
```

## Decision Criteria

### Create When:
- Pattern used 3+ times
- Would save significant time if reused
- Not too project-specific
- Clear trigger phrases exist

### Skip When:
- One-off task
- Too project-specific
- Already documented
- Requires user decision (suggest instead)

## Example Session Analysis

**Observed**: Created API endpoint 4 times with same structure.

**Analysis**:
- Repeated pattern? ✓ (4 times)
- Multi-step? ✓ (Controller, Service, DTO, tests)
- Reusable? ✓ (applies to any endpoint)

**Action**: Check if `api-create` skill exists → Already exists, no action.

---

**Observed**: Had to look up soft-delete query pattern twice.

**Analysis**:
- Caused friction? ✓
- Convention exists? Partially in entity-repository.md

**Action**: Update `claude/rules/entity-repository.md` with explicit example.

---

**Observed**: Wrote one-time data migration script.

**Analysis**:
- Repeated? ✗ (one-off)

**Action**: None - too specific.
