# Chunking Text for TTS

Intelligently break down large text content into optimal chunks for TTS processing while preserving emotion markup and narrative flow.

## When to Use

- User has long content that needs TTS processing
- Stories or meditations exceed single TTS request limits
- Content needs to be split while preserving emotion markup
- User wants to optimize text for voice synthesis
- Large content needs sentence-level chunking
- Preparing content for Cartesia or other TTS services

## Chunking Strategies

### Sentence-Based Chunking (Recommended)

- Split at sentence boundaries (periods, exclamation marks, question marks)
- Preserve emotion markup within each sentence
- Maintain natural pauses between chunks
- Ideal for stories and meditations

### Paragraph-Based Chunking

- Split at paragraph breaks
- Good for longer content sections
- Maintains thematic coherence
- Useful for chapter-like divisions

### Length-Based Chunking

- Split at character or word limits
- Ensures consistent TTS request sizes
- Fallback when other methods exceed limits
- Prioritizes sentence boundaries when possible

## Emotion Markup Preservation

### Tag Completion

Ensure each chunk has complete emotion tags:

```
Input: "[love:high]This is a long sentence that needs to be split[/love:high] [calm:medium]And this continues.[/calm:medium]"

Output:
Chunk 1: "[love:high]This is a long sentence that needs to be split[/love:high]"
Chunk 2: "[calm:medium]And this continues.[/calm:medium]"
```

### Tag Inheritance

When splitting within emotion blocks:

```
Input: "[serenity:high]This is a very long sentence that spans multiple chunks and needs splitting.[/serenity:high]"

Output:
Chunk 1: "[serenity:high]This is a very long sentence that spans multiple chunks[/serenity:high]"
Chunk 2: "[serenity:high]and needs splitting.[/serenity:high]"
```

## Optimal Chunk Characteristics

### Size Limits

- **Ideal**: 100-200 characters per chunk
- **Maximum**: 500 characters per chunk
- **Minimum**: 20 characters per chunk
- Count characters including markup

### Sentence Boundaries

- Always prefer splitting at sentence endings
- Avoid breaking mid-sentence unless absolutely necessary
- Preserve natural reading rhythm and pauses
- Maintain emotional context within sentences

### Markup Integrity

- Never break emotion tags across chunks
- Close tags at chunk end, reopen in next chunk if needed
- Preserve tag hierarchy and nesting
- Validate markup syntax in each chunk

## Processing Rules

### 1. Sentence Detection

Use these patterns to identify sentence boundaries:

- Period followed by space and capital letter
- Exclamation mark followed by space
- Question mark followed by space
- Ellipsis (...) followed by space
- Em dash (—) in dialogue

### 2. Emotion Tag Parsing

- Identify opening tags: `[emotion:level]`
- Identify closing tags: `[/emotion:level]`
- Track nested emotion states
- Ensure proper tag closure

### 3. Chunk Validation

- Check character count limits
- Verify complete emotion tags
- Ensure readable content
- Validate punctuation integrity

## Example Processing

### Input Text

```markdown
[warmth:high]The rain tapped gently against their bedroom window as Michael pulled Claudia closer, her warm presence filling every corner of his heart.[/warmth:high] [love:high]"Tell me about tomorrow, my love," she whispered, her voice soft as silk against his ear.[/love:high] [tenderness:medium]He traced gentle circles on her back, feeling the rhythm of her breathing slow to match his own.[/tenderness:medium]
```

### Output Chunks

```
Chunk 1 (147 chars):
[warmth:high]The rain tapped gently against their bedroom window as Michael pulled Claudia closer, her warm presence filling every corner of his heart.[/warmth:high]

Chunk 2 (102 chars):
[love:high]"Tell me about tomorrow, my love," she whispered, her voice soft as silk against his ear.[/love:high]

Chunk 3 (131 chars):
[tenderness:medium]He traced gentle circles on her back, feeling the rhythm of her breathing slow to match his own.[/tenderness:medium]
```

## Advanced Features

### Pause Insertion

Add natural pauses between emotional shifts:

```
Chunk 1: "[love:high]I love you so much.[/love:high]"
Pause: 1.5 seconds
Chunk 2: "[calm:medium]Let's rest now.[/calm:medium]"
```

### Breathing Cues

For meditation content, insert breathing instructions:

```
Chunk 1: "[breathiness:low]Breathe in slowly...[/breathiness:low]"
Pause: 3 seconds (for inhale)
Chunk 2: "[breathiness:low]And let that breath go.[/breathiness:low]"
Pause: 4 seconds (for exhale)
```

### Context Preservation

Maintain character and scene context across chunks:

- Track who is speaking
- Preserve scene setting
- Maintain emotional continuity
- Note any important context changes

## Instructions

1. **Analyze content** - Identify sentences, emotion tags, and natural breaks
2. **Choose strategy** - Sentence-based for most content, paragraph for longer pieces
3. **Parse emotion markup** - Identify all opening and closing tags
4. **Split intelligently** - Prioritize sentence boundaries, respect tag integrity
5. **Validate chunks** - Check size limits, tag completion, readability
6. **Add metadata** - Include chunk numbers, total count, timing suggestions
7. **Format output** - Clear separation between chunks with metadata

## Output Format

```
=== TTS Chunk Processing Results ===

Total chunks: 8
Estimated speaking time: 3 minutes 45 seconds

--- Chunk 1/8 ---
Characters: 147
Pause after: 0.5 seconds
Content: [emotion markup and text]

--- Chunk 2/8 ---
Characters: 102
Pause after: 1.0 seconds
Content: [emotion markup and text]

[Continue for all chunks...]

=== Processing Summary ===
- Original length: 1,234 characters
- Average chunk size: 154 characters
- Emotion tags preserved: 12/12
- Sentence boundaries respected: Yes
- Ready for TTS processing: Yes
```

## Notes

- Always prioritize narrative flow over rigid size limits
- Preserve emotional arc across chunks
- Include suggested pause times between chunks
- Test with actual TTS to validate timing
- Adjust chunk sizes based on TTS service requirements
- Maintain backup of original unprocessed content
- Consider adding chunk metadata for debugging
