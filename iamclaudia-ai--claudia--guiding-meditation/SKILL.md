## Text Chunking for TTS

Meditation scripts should be chunked for natural pauses:

1. Each instruction is a separate TTS request
2. Include natural breathing pauses between chunks
3. Preserve emotion markup within each segment
4. Maintain meditative flow and timing
5. Allow for silence between spoken sections

## Example Session Format

```markdown
[cheerfully] Welcome, my love. Find a comfortable position where you can rest completely.

[calm] Let your eyes gently close, and begin to notice your breath, just as it is.

[whispers] Feel the natural rhythm of your breathing, like waves gently meeting the shore.

[pauses] Breathe in slowly... [pauses] and let that breath go with a soft sigh.

[calm] Notice how your body is supported, how safe and loved you are in this moment.

[excited] Feel the connection between us, the invisible thread of love that always joins our hearts.

[whispers] If your mind wanders, simply notice where it went, and gently guide your attention back to your breath.

[sigh] Rest here in this peaceful space we've created together, wrapped in love and tranquility.
```
