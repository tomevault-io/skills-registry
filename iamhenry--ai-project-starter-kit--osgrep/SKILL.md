name: osgrep
description: Semantic code search using natural language queries. Use when users ask "where is X implemented", "how does Y work", "find the logic for Z", or need to locate code by concept rather than exact text. Returns file paths with line numbers and code snippets. Use when this capability is needed.

## When to Use

Use this to find code by **concept** or **behavior** (e.g., "where is auth validated", "how are plugins loaded").
_Note: This tool prioritizes finding the right files and locations in the code. Snippets are truncated (max 16 lines) and are often just previews._

Example:

```bash
osgrep "how are plugins loaded"
osgrep "how are plugins loaded" packages/transformers.js/src
```

## Strategy for Different Query Types

### For **Architectural/System-Level Questions** (auth, LSP integration, file watching)

1. **Search Broadly First:** Use a conceptual query to map the landscape.
   - `osgrep "authentication authorization checks"`
2. **Survey the Results:** Look for patterns across multiple files:
   - Are checks in middleware? Decorators? Multiple services?
   - Do file paths suggest different layers (gateway, handlers, utils)?
3. **Read Strategically:** Pick 2-4 files that represent different aspects:
   - Read the main entry point
   - Read representative middleware/util files
   - Follow imports if architecture is unclear
4. **Refine with Specific Searches:** If one aspect is unclear:
   - `osgrep "session validation logic"`
   - `osgrep "API authentication middleware"`

### For **Targeted Implementation Details** (specific function, algorithm)

1. **Search Specifically:** Ask about the precise logic.
   - `osgrep "logic for merging user and default configuration"`
2. **Evaluate the Semantic Match:**
   - Does the snippet look relevant?
   - **Crucial:** If it ends in `...` or cuts off mid-logic, **read the file**.
3. **One Search, One Read:** Use osgrep to pinpoint the best file, then read it fully.

## Hybrid Search Strategy (Semantic + Grep)

Combining semantic search with grep is 31% more effective than either alone.

**Decision Heuristic:**

- **osgrep**: Exploration. You don't know exact names/patterns.
- **rg (ripgrep)**: Precision. You know the symbol/pattern to find.

**Two-Stage Workflow:**

1. **Discover with osgrep**: Find the right files conceptually

   - `osgrep "authentication validation logic"`
   - → Returns `src/auth/middleware.ts:45`, `src/utils/jwt.ts:12`

2. **Pinpoint with ripgrep**: Find exact matches in those files
   - `rg "verifyToken|validateJWT" src/auth/ src/utils/`
   - → Returns exact line numbers with context

**Example: Finding rate limiting implementation**

```bash
# Step 1: Conceptual discovery
osgrep "rate limiting throttling"
# → src/middleware/rateLimit.ts:23, src/api/limiter.ts:8

# Step 2: Exact symbols/patterns
rg "RateLimiter|throttle" src/middleware/ src/api/
```

**Why this works:** Semantic search narrows to the right files. Grep pinpoints exact locations within those files. Together = faster, more accurate results.

## Output Format

Returns: `path/to/file:line [Tags] Code Snippet`

Example:

```
ORCHESTRATION src/auth/handler.ts:45
Defines: handleAuth | Calls: validate, checkRole, respond | Score: .94

export async function handleAuth(req: Request) {
  const token = req.headers.get("Authorization");
  ...
```

**Tags:**

- `ORCHESTRATION`: Contains logic, coordinates other code. Prioritize these.
- `DEFINITION`: Types, interfaces, classes.

**Metadata:**

- `Defines`: What this code defines
- `Calls`: What this code calls (helps trace flow)
- `Score`: Relevance (1 = best match)

**Markers:**

- `...`: Truncation marker. Snippet is incomplete—use `Read` for full context.

## Other Commands

```bash
# Trace call graph (who calls X, what X calls)
osgrep trace handleAuth

# Skeleton of a huge file (find which ranges to read)
osgrep skeleton src/giant-2000-line-file.ts

# Just file paths when you only need locations
osgrep "authentication" --compact
```

## Tips

- **More Words = Better:** "auth" is vague. "where does the server validate JWT tokens" is specific.
- **Prioritize ORCH Results:** ORCHESTRATION results contain the logic—start there.
- **Trust the Semantics:** You don't need exact names. `osgrep "how does the server start"` works better than guessing `osgrep "server.init"`.
- **Watch for Distributed Patterns:** If results span 5+ files in different directories, the feature is likely architectural—survey before diving deep.
- **Scope When Possible:** Use path constraints to focus: `osgrep "auth" src/server/`
- **Use Line Ranges:** Don't read entire files. Use the line ranges osgrep gives you.
- **Rephrase If Needed:** If results seem off, rephrase your query like you'd ask a teammate.

## If Index is Building

If you see "Indexing", "Building", or "Syncing": STOP. Alert the user that the index is building. Ask if they want to wait or proceed with partial results.
