# React Grab

React Grab lets you hold ⌘C (Cmd+C on Mac, Ctrl+C on Windows) and click any element in your running web app to automatically capture its context and send it to Claude Code for modification.

**Performance:** Makes tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot run up to 66% faster by providing precise element context.

## What This Does

Instead of describing which UI element you want to change, you literally just click it. React Grab captures:
- The file name
- The React component code
- The HTML source

This context goes directly to your AI coding agent for instant modifications.

## Easiest Setup (Recommended)

### Automatic CLI Installer

Run this at your project root (where `next.config.ts` or `vite.config.ts` lives):

```bash
npx @react-grab/cli@latest
```

The CLI automatically detects your framework and configures everything. Just refresh your browser after.

## Manual Setup (If Needed)

### For Any JavaScript App (Universal Method)

Add this script tag to your HTML:

```html
<script
  src="//unpkg.com/react-grab/dist/index.global.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

**Where to add it:**
- In `index.html` - put it in the `<head>` section
- Only for development - don't ship this to production

### For Next.js App Router (app directory)

In your `app/layout.tsx`:

```typescript
import Script from "next/script";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        {process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" && (
          <Script
            src="//unpkg.com/react-grab/dist/index.global.js"
            crossOrigin="anonymous"
            strategy="beforeInteractive"
          />
        )}
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### For Next.js Pages Router (pages directory)

In your `pages/_document.tsx`:

```typescript
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";
import Script from "next/script";

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html lang="en">
      <Head>
        {process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" && (
          <Script
            src="//unpkg.com/react-grab/dist/index.global.js"
            crossOrigin="anonymous"
            strategy="beforeInteractive"
          />
        )}
      </Head>
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

### For Vite

Your `index.html` should look like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script type="module">
      // First: npm i react-grab
      if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
        import("react-grab");
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### For Webpack

First, install React Grab:
```bash
npm install react-grab
```

Then add this at the top of your main entry file (e.g., `src/index.tsx`):

```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  import("react-grab");
}
```

## Claude Code Agent Integration (Beta)

React Grab can send selected element context **directly to Claude Code** - no copying and pasting needed. Just select an element and Claude Code automatically receives the context and can make changes.

### Server Setup

The server runs on port `4567` and interfaces with the Claude Agent SDK. 

Add to your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npx @react-grab/claude-code@latest && next dev"
  }
}
```

This starts the React Grab server before your dev server.

### Client Setup

Add the Claude Code client script to your app:

**HTML:**
```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/react-grab/dist/index.global.js"></script>
<script src="//unpkg.com/@react-grab/claude-code/dist/client.global.js"></script>
```

**Next.js (in `app/layout.tsx`):**
```typescript
import Script from "next/script";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        {process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" && (
          <>
            <Script
              src="//unpkg.com/react-grab/dist/index.global.js"
              strategy="beforeInteractive"
            />
            <Script
              src="//unpkg.com/@react-grab/claude-code/dist/client.global.js"
              strategy="lazyOnload"
            />
          </>
        )}
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### How It Works

1. Start your dev server (the React Grab server starts automatically)
2. Open your app in browser
3. Hold ⌘C and click an element
4. Claude Code receives the context automatically
5. Tell Claude Code what changes you want
6. Claude makes the changes to your codebase

**Flow:**
```
Browser → React Grab → Local Server (port 4567) → Claude Agent SDK → Your Code
```

## How to Use

### Basic Usage (Copy to Clipboard)
1. **Start your dev server** - Run your app normally (`npm run dev`, etc.)
2. **Open your app in a browser** - Navigate to localhost:3000 or wherever it's running
3. **Hold ⌘C (or Ctrl+C)** - Keep it pressed
4. **Click any element** - Click the button, text, card, whatever you want to modify
5. **The context is copied** - File name, component code, and HTML are automatically copied
6. **Tell Claude Code what to change** - Paste into your terminal and describe the modification

### With Claude Code Agent Integration
1. **Start your dev server** - The React Grab server starts automatically
2. **Open your app in a browser**
3. **Hold ⌘C and click an element** - Context is sent directly to Claude Code
4. **Tell Claude Code what to change** - No pasting needed, just describe what you want
5. **Claude makes the changes** - It modifies your actual code files

## Advanced Customization

React Grab provides a customization API if you need more control:

```typescript
import { init } from "react-grab/core";

const api = init({
  theme: {
    enabled: true, // Disable all UI by setting to false
    hue: 180, // Shift colors (e.g., 180 = pink → cyan)
    crosshair: {
      enabled: false, // Disable crosshair
    },
    elementLabel: {
      enabled: false, // Disable element label
    },
  },
  onElementSelect: (element) => {
    console.log("Selected:", element);
  },
  onCopySuccess: (elements, content) => {
    console.log("Copied:", content);
  },
  onStateChange: (state) => {
    console.log("Active:", state.isActive);
  },
});

// Programmatic control
api.activate();
api.copyElement(document.querySelector(".my-element"));
console.log(api.getState());
```

## Important Notes

- **Development only** - The setup ensures React Grab only loads in development mode
- **Works with any framework** - React, Next.js, Vite, Webpack, or plain HTML
- **Compatible with Claude Code and OpenCode** - Direct agent integration available
- **No manual copy-paste with agent integration** - Context flows directly to your AI tool
- **66% faster** - By providing precise element context instead of vague descriptions

## Other Agent Integrations

React Grab also supports OpenCode with a similar setup:

**OpenCode:** Runs on port `6567`, requires `opencode-ai` CLI  
```bash
npm i -g opencode-ai@latest
```

Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npx @react-grab/opencode@latest && next dev"
  }
}
```

Client setup (in `app/layout.tsx`):
```typescript
import Script from "next/script";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        {process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" && (
          <>
            <Script
              src="//unpkg.com/react-grab/dist/index.global.js"
              strategy="beforeInteractive"
            />
            <Script
              src="//unpkg.com/@react-grab/opencode/dist/client.global.js"
              strategy="lazyOnload"
            />
          </>
        )}
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Check the [React Grab repo](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-grab) for detailed integration docs.

## Troubleshooting

**Not working?**
- Make sure your dev server is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the script tag loaded (look in Network tab)
- Try refreshing the page

**Script not loading?**
- Ensure you're running in development mode
- Try using the CDN URL directly without a bundler first
- Check that `process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"` is evaluating correctly

**Agent integration not working?**
- Verify the server is running on the correct port (4567 for Claude Code)
- Check that both scripts are loaded (react-grab and claude-code client)
- Look for any CORS errors in browser console

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Asks to "setup React Grab" or "install React Grab"
- Mentions "click to edit" or "visual selection" for UI elements
- Wants to modify UI elements interactively
- Is working on frontend development and wants faster AI assistance
- Asks about integrating visual element selection with Claude Code
- Wants to connect their browser UI directly to their AI coding agent
- Mentions wanting to speed up their development workflow with AI
- Is frustrated with describing which UI element they want to modify
