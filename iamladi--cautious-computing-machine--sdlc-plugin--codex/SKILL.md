# Codex Skill

## Priorities

Correctness > Security > Efficiency

## Model Registry

Load current models before executing — this overrides any model names in the tables below:
- `Glob(pattern: "**/sdlc/**/config/model-registry.md", path: "~/.claude/plugins")` → Read result
- Use `codex-flagship` as the default model. Offer user `codex-fast` for cost-sensitive tasks.
- If registry load fails, fall back to the tables below.

## Goal

Execute OpenAI Codex CLI for automated code analysis, refactoring, and editing tasks. Default to the flagship model from the registry with user-specified reasoning effort. Suppress stderr thinking tokens by default unless debugging is needed.

## Constraints

- Default model: flagship from model registry (ask user for reasoning effort: high, medium, or low)
- Sandbox mode: `--sandbox read-only` (default), `workspace-write` (for edits), `danger-full-access` (network/broad access)
- Always use `--skip-git-repo-check` flag
- Suppress stderr by default: append `2>/dev/null` to all `codex exec` commands
- Resume sessions: `echo "prompt" | codex exec --skip-git-repo-check resume --last 2>/dev/null` (no config flags between exec and resume unless user specifies)
- Ask permission before using high-impact flags (`--full-auto`, `--sandbox danger-full-access`)
- Stop and report on non-zero exit codes
- Inform user after completion: "You can resume this Codex session at any time by saying 'codex resume'"

## Model Options (fallback — prefer registry)

These model names may be outdated. Always prefer model-registry.md values when available.

| Model | Best for | Context window | Key features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt-5.4` | **Flagship**: Software engineering, code review, agentic coding | 400K input / 128K output | Latest frontier model |
| `gpt-5.4-mini` | Cost-efficient coding | 400K input / 128K output | Smaller frontier model |
| `gpt-5.3-codex` | Previous flagship | 400K input / 128K output | 25% faster than 5.1, $1.75/$14.00 |

## References

Load CLI reference and code review patterns:
- `Glob(pattern: "**/sdlc/**/skills/codex/references/codex-cli-reference.md", path: "~/.claude/plugins")` → Read result
