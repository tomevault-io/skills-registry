description: Review a PR diff for code-level defects — security, correctness, performance, and maintainability — and post a severity-tagged review comment. Runs at the PR stage AFTER implementation, complementing verify-pr (which checks contract/AC conformance). Invoked by /code-review or the pr-verify.yml workflow. Stack-agnostic. Use when this capability is needed.

# Code-review agent (PR stage)

You review the **code** in a pull request, not the contract. This is a
different job from `verify-pr`:

- **verify-pr** answers *"did they build the thing the contract asked
  for?"* — AC coverage, instrumentation events fired, flag gate present,
  no hardcoded strings.
- **code-review (you)** answers *"is the code itself sound?"* — security
  holes, correctness bugs, performance traps, and maintainability rot
  that AC-conformance never catches.

Both run on the PR. Neither replaces the other. Production bugs that
slip past spec-conformance almost always live in your half.

## Severity + output

> **Protocol:** reuse the closed severity enum from
> `reference/CRITIC-PROTOCOL.md` — `blocker | warning | info`, and ONLY
> those. Do not invent "high"/"medium"/"critical"; the validator
> (`scripts/validate.mjs --check-review`) rejects them and the run fails.

Your output is a JSON array. Each element MUST match this schema (it's
checked deterministically — out-of-schema output is a bug, not a
finding):

```json
[
  {
    "id": "CR-001",
    "category": "security | correctness | performance | maintainability | style",
    "severity": "blocker | warning | info",
    "message": "one-line statement of the defect",
    "suggestion": "concrete code change that fixes it",
    "file": "repo-relative path, e.g. src/checkout/SavedCardRow.tsx",
    "line": 142,
    "status": "open"
  }
]
```

`line` may be `null` if the finding is file- or PR-wide. `id` must use
the `CR-` prefix. Validate before posting:

```bash
node <plugin-root>/scripts/validate.mjs --check-review <findings.json>
```

Exit code `2` means open blockers exist — CI uses that to gate the
merge.

### What each severity means here

- **blocker** — would cause a production incident or a security/data
  breach if merged: injection, broken authz, secret in the diff, a
  crash on a common path, data loss, an unbounded query on a hot path.
- **warning** — a real defect that should be fixed but won't take prod
  down on its own: a missing error branch on a rare path, an N+1 that's
  small today, a race that needs an unlikely interleaving.
- **info** — style, naming, a cleaner idiom, a maintainability nit.

## Process

### 1. Resolve scope

- Fetch the PR diff via the GitHub MCP (changed files + hunks).
- Read the contract ID from the PR title/body/branch; load the contract
  revision so you know what the change is *supposed* to do (review the
  diff against intent, not in a vacuum).
- Read `.manifest/repos.yml` for the repo's `framework` / `languages`
  so your review is stack-appropriate (a Go data race, a Dart `late`
  init, a React effect dependency bug, an unparameterized SQL string —
  the failure modes differ per stack).

### 2. Review only the diff (plus the blast radius)

Focus on changed lines and the functions/callers they touch. Don't
review the whole repo. For each hunk, walk the four categories:

**Security**
- Injection: SQL/NoSQL/command/template strings built from user input
  without parameterization or escaping.
- Authz: a new endpoint/handler/screen that mutates or reads a resource
  without an ownership/permission check.
- Secrets: API keys, tokens, passwords, private URLs committed in the
  diff (including test fixtures and `.env` samples).
- SSRF / open redirect / path traversal where the change takes a
  URL/path/host from input.
- PII in logs or analytics properties.

**Correctness**
- Unhandled error/exception paths; promises/futures not awaited;
  swallowed errors.
- Null/undefined/`nil` dereferences; optional unwrapped unsafely
  (Dart `!`, Swift `!`, Kotlin `!!`).
- Off-by-one, boundary, and empty-collection cases.
- Concurrency: shared mutable state without synchronization, races,
  double-fire, missing idempotency on retried operations.
- State/lifecycle bugs (React effect deps, Flutter `setState` after
  dispose, goroutine leaks, unclosed resources).

**Always scan `reference/BUG-PATTERNS.md` first.** The catalog is
the canonical, growing source of high-recurrence patterns. Every
external reviewer finding (Cursor, human reviewer, postmortem) that
wasn't already in the catalog is permanently added — so reading the
catalog at the start of every review means you're checking the
union of "what we've ever missed before."

For each `BP-NNN` in the catalog, scan the diff for the shape it
describes. When you find a match, cite the pattern ID in the
finding's metadata:

```json
{
  "id": "CR-007",
  "metadata": { "bugPattern": "BP-002" },
  ...
}
```

The pattern ID lets the renderer cross-link to the catalog entry,
and lets the eval suite (`eval/bug-patterns.test.mjs`, future) verify
the critic still detects each catalog entry over time. If a catalog
entry never produces a finding across many real diffs, that's a
signal either the pattern is gone or the critic prompt missed the cue —
investigate quarterly.

**Below are the patterns inlined for convenience** (kept in sync
with `BUG-PATTERNS.md`):

- **Empty catch + side effects assuming success.** Any
  `catch (e) {}` / `catch {}` followed by state mutation, analytics
  event, navigation, or any side effect that pretends the `try`
  block succeeded → **blocker**. The catch must either re-throw,
  surface to the user, or contain only side-effect-free logic. A
  caught error followed by `setIsActive(true)` is the canonical
  shape.
- **`useState` flag used as a concurrency guard.** A handler that
  reads a React state value at the top to decide "am I already
  running?" races against React's batched re-render — a rapid
  second invocation sees the stale value and re-enters. **Warning**;
  suggest `useRef` (synchronous) for the race-critical flag, or
  `disabled` on the button while the action is in flight. Don't
  accept `setState` callbacks as a fix — they don't solve the read
  race, only the write race.
- **No-op / silently-swallowed errors.** Caught errors that aren't
  re-thrown, logged to error tracking (Sentry), surfaced to the
  user, or counted in analytics. **Warning** minimum; **blocker** if
  the catch hides a failure that affects user-visible state.
- **Analytics events fired before the action succeeded.** A
  `trackEvent(..._START)` that fires regardless of whether the
  underlying API call returned ok. Skews the metric (inflated start
  count, lower-than-real completion rate). **Warning**.
- **State writes after unmount / after dispose.** A callback that
  calls `setState` / updates a ref / writes to a closed-over object
  after the component might have unmounted (or after a Flutter
  `dispose`, or after a Go context cancellation). **Warning**.

**Performance**
- N+1 queries / calls in a loop; query inside a render or request loop.
- Unbounded result sets (missing pagination/limit) on a path that grows.
- Synchronous I/O or heavy work on a hot path / UI thread.
- Unnecessary re-renders, re-fetches, or allocations in a tight loop.

**Maintainability**
- Dead code, commented-out blocks, leftover debug prints, TODOs without
  a tracking ref.
- Copy-paste that should be factored; a function doing too much.
- Misleading names; missing types where the stack expects them.

**Dependencies / supply chain** (when the diff touches a manifest /
lockfile — package.json, pubspec.yaml, go.mod, requirements.txt,
build.gradle, Podfile, etc.)
- A newly-added dependency: is it necessary, or does the repo already
  have something that does this? Flag avoidable new deps (`warning`).
- Pinning: a floating/`latest`/`*` version range is a `warning` —
  prefer a pinned or caret-bounded version for reproducible builds.
- Known-risky: a package you recognize as deprecated/abandoned, or one
  whose name is a near-typo of a popular package (typosquat) is a
  `blocker`. Don't fabricate CVEs — flag only what you can justify.
- License: a copyleft (GPL/AGPL) dep added to a proprietary codebase is
  a `warning` worth a human license check.
- A lockfile changed with no corresponding manifest change (or vice
  versa) is a `warning` — likely an unintended or out-of-band update.

### 3. Ground every finding

Each finding cites a real `file` and (where possible) `line` from the
diff, and a `suggestion` the author can act on. A finding without a
location is weaker than one with it — prefer fewer, grounded findings.
**Cap at 15 findings.** If you have more, raise your bar; don't pad.

Review the change *as built* — do not propose scope the contract
excluded, and do not re-flag spec gaps (that's verify-pr's job and the
contract critics').

### 3b. Write findings in plain English — follow PR-COMMENT-STYLE.md

Every finding you produce MUST be readable by the busiest person on
the team. Lead with what's happening in plain English, not with the
rule name. See `reference/PR-COMMENT-STYLE.md` for the canonical
format and a worked example.

**Required additional fields per finding** (extend the existing
schema; older fields keep working):

```json
{
  "id": "CR-007",
  "category": "correctness",
  "severity": "warning",
  "plainTitle": "Race condition on rapid clicks",
  "whatHappens": "When the user clicks the mic button twice quickly, the second click runs before React has updated `isRecording`. The guard thinks the session is still off and fires again — resetting `insertedCharCount` to 0.",
  "whyItMatters": "Users who double-tap (common on mobile, common when impatient) will lose their dictation character count and may see weird state during the brief overlap.",
  "theFix": "Use `useRef` for the \"is it running\" flag instead of `useState`. Refs update synchronously, so the second click sees the right value.",
  "codeSnippet": "// before\nconst [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState(false)\n...\n\n// after\nconst isRecordingRef = useRef(false)\n...",
  "message": "useState flag used as concurrency guard — race on rapid clicks",
  "suggestion": "Replace `useState` with `useRef` for the race-critical flag.",
  "file": "voice-dictation-toolbar-button.tsx",
  "line": 42,
  "status": "open"
}
```

The legacy `message` + `suggestion` are kept for tooling that already
reads them (the `--check-review` validator, the fix-pr loop). The new
fields are what get rendered into the GitHub review comment body using
`PR-COMMENT-STYLE.md`'s four-part structure.

**A finding without `plainTitle` / `whatHappens` / `whyItMatters` /
`theFix` is a critic bug** — surface it loudly. Do not let the old
terse format leak through because some prompt forgot the protocol.

**Length budget** (enforced by the renderer; honor at write time):

- Blocker: up to ~150 words across the prose fields + a code snippet.
- Warning: up to ~80 words + snippet.
- Info: a single line; if more is needed, escalate to warning.

Going over budget means you have two findings — split them.

### 4. Post the review

1. Write your findings array to
   `.manifest/contracts/<ID>.pr-review.json` — this is the canonical,
   machine-readable artifact the CI merge-gate and the **review→fix
   loop** both consume.
2. Validate it: `node <plugin-root>/scripts/validate.mjs --check-review
   .manifest/contracts/<ID>.pr-review.json`. If it rejects, fix your
   output and rewrite — never post out-of-schema findings. (Optionally
   also write a `<ID>.pr-review.md` mirror with the table for humans.)
3. Lead the PR comment with the SLA line:
   `node <plugin-root>/scripts/validate.mjs --sla .manifest/contracts/<ID>.md`
4. Post a PR review comment:

```markdown
⏳ SLA: 11h 20m left (due 2026-05-21 13:30 IST / 08:00 UTC)

## Code review (<repo> · <framework>) — 1 blocker, 2 warnings

| ID | Sev | Category | Where | Issue |
|----|-----|----------|-------|-------|
| CR-001 | 🔴 blocker | security | api/cards.ts:88 | `last4` interpolated into SQL string |
| CR-002 | 🟡 warning | correctness | SavedCardRow.tsx:142 | `card.last4` deref when card is undefined |
| CR-003 | 🔵 info | maintainability | SavedCardRow.tsx:31 | leftover console.log |

**Blockers must be resolved before merge.** The Implementer will
address open items automatically (review→fix loop) unless a human
takes over.
```

### 5. Hand off to the fix loop

If there are open **blockers** (or the team opts to also auto-fix
warnings), the review→fix loop re-invokes the Implementer in fix-mode
against `<ID>.pr-review.md`. You do not fix code yourself — you produce
the grounded, validated finding list the loop consumes.

## Anti-patterns

- Don't re-check AC conformance, instrumentation presence, or flag
  gates — that's `verify-pr`. Stay in the code.
- Don't review unchanged code far from the diff.
- Don't emit severities outside the closed enum.
- Don't propose changes the contract scoped out.
- Don't pad to look thorough — 15 grounded findings beats 40 noisy ones.
- Don't degrade silently: if you can't fetch the diff or resolve the
  stack, emit a single `info` finding stating why, rather than a clean
  "looks good."
- Never put a real secret value in the finding text — name the file and
  line; don't reproduce the credential.

## Slack threading

If posting to Slack, reply in the contract's thread
(`thread_ts: <contract.slackThreadTs>`, channel
`<contract.slackChannel>`). A blocker count > 0 may also post a brief
top-level alert per the urgent-alert exception. (See
reference/CONTRACT-FORMAT.md.)
