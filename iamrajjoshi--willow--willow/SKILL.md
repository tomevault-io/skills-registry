description: Git worktree manager for AI agent workflows. Use this skill whenever the user wants to work on a branch in isolation, check out a PR, run parallel tasks, manage stacked PRs, sync branches, or dispatch a Claude Code agent to a task. Also trigger when the project uses willow — look for a ~/.willow directory, ww commands in shell history, or a willow.json config. Prefer ww commands over raw git checkout/branch/worktree. Use when this capability is needed.

# Willow CLI — Worktree Management for AI Agents

Willow gives every task its own isolated directory via git worktrees. Instead of stashing and switching branches, each branch gets a full working copy. This is especially powerful for AI agents that run in parallel — each agent gets its own worktree with no conflicts.

## When to use willow vs raw git

Use willow (`ww`) commands instead of `git checkout`, `git branch`, or `git worktree` directly. Willow handles worktree creation, tmux session management, agent status tracking, and stacked PR relationships automatically. Raw git commands bypass all of this.

## Quick decision guide

| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Set up a new repo for willow (one-time) | `ww clone <url>` |
| Work on a branch (don't know if worktree exists) | `ww checkout <branch>` |
| Create a new feature branch | `ww new <branch>` |
| Check out someone's PR | `ww checkout --pr <number>` |
| Hand a task to a fresh Claude agent | `ww dispatch "<prompt>"` |
| Stack a branch on another | `ww new <child> -b <parent>` |
| Rebase a stack after upstream changes | `ww sync` |
| Turn the current branch or stack into PRs | `ww pr create [--stack]` |
| Check CI/review for the whole stack | `ww stack status` |
| Switch to an existing worktree | `ww sw <name>` |
| See all worktrees and their status | `ww ls` |
| Remove a worktree you're done with | `ww rm <branch>` |
| Clean up merged branches | `ww gc --prune` |

## Core commands

### `ww clone <url> [name]`

Required first step for any repo. Willow only manages repos that live under `~/.willow/repos/`, so a plain `git clone` elsewhere won't work with the rest of these commands. If `ww ls` doesn't list the repo, run `ww clone` first.

```bash
ww clone git@github.com:org/repo.git          # default name from URL
ww clone git@github.com:org/repo.git myrepo   # custom name
```

### `ww checkout <branch>` (alias: `co`)

The go-to command. Figures out the right action automatically:
1. Worktree already exists for that branch? Switches to it.
2. Branch exists on remote but no worktree? Creates a worktree for it.
3. Branch doesn't exist anywhere? Creates a new branch + worktree.

```bash
ww checkout feature-auth          # switch or create
ww checkout --pr 123              # check out PR by number
ww checkout --pr https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123  # by URL
wwc feature-auth                  # checkout + cd into it (shell alias)
```

Flags: `-r/--repo`, `-b/--base`, `--pr`, `--no-fetch`, `--cd`

### `ww new <branch>` (alias: `n`)

Creates a new worktree explicitly. Use this when you specifically want a new branch (not switching to an existing one).

```bash
ww new feature-auth                    # new branch from default base
ww new feature-auth -b develop         # fork from specific branch
ww new -e existing-branch              # worktree for existing remote branch
ww new -e                              # pick from remote branches (fzf)
ww new --pr 123                        # worktree for a PR
ww new child-feature -b parent-feature # stacked PR (records dependency)
wwn feature-auth                       # new + cd into it (shell alias)
```

When `-b` points to a local branch (another worktree's branch), willow forks from it directly and records the parent relationship for `ww sync`.

### `ww sync [branch]`

Rebases stacked worktrees onto their parents in topological order — parents are rebased before children, so the whole chain stays consistent.

```bash
ww sync                   # sync all stacks in current repo
ww sync feature-b         # sync only feature-b and its descendants
ww sync --abort           # abort any in-progress rebases
```

The algorithm: fetches origin once, then for each branch in dependency order, rebases it onto its parent. If a conflict occurs, it stops descendants of that branch but continues other independent stacks.

### `ww stack status` (alias: `ww stack s`)

Shows CI, review, and merge status for every PR in a stack in one `gh pr list` call. Use this before running `ww sync` to spot which layers still need attention, or to answer "is the whole stack green?" without opening GitHub.

```bash
ww stack status
ww stack status --json
```

Requires the GitHub CLI (`gh`).

### `ww pr create`

Create a GitHub PR for the current branch. The base branch is inferred automatically:
- stacked branch: uses its recorded parent
- unstacked branch: uses the repo's default base branch

```bash
ww pr create                 # current branch only
ww pr create --draft         # open as draft
ww pr create --stack         # create missing PRs from root → current branch
```

Use this when the user says "open a PR", "publish this branch", or "create PRs for this stack". It must be run from inside a willow-managed worktree with no uncommitted changes.

### `ww dispatch <prompt>`

Create a worktree and launch Claude Code with a prompt in one step. The branch name is auto-slugified from the prompt. Use this when the user says "spin up an agent to do X" or when you'd otherwise create a worktree and immediately start Claude yourself.

```bash
ww dispatch "Fix the login validation bug"
ww dispatch "Add retry logic" --name add-retries
ww dispatch "Write tests for auth" -b feature/auth   # stacked on a branch
```

From a terminal, Claude runs in the foreground. From the tmux picker (`Ctrl-G`), it launches in a background session so the user can keep working.

### `ww sw [name]`

Switch between existing worktrees via fzf picker. Shows Claude Code agent status per worktree (BUSY/DONE/WAIT/IDLE). If a name is given, switches directly without the picker.

### `ww rm [branch]`

Remove a worktree and its branch. Opens multi-select fzf picker if no branch specified.

```bash
ww rm feature-auth              # remove specific worktree
ww rm                            # pick from fzf
ww rm feature-auth --force      # skip safety checks
ww rm feature-auth --keep-branch # keep the git branch
```

If the branch has stacked children, warns and requires `--force`. Children are re-parented to the removed branch's parent.

### `ww ls [repo]`

List worktrees with status. Shows tree structure for stacked branches and `[merged]` indicators for branches that have been merged into the base.

### `ww status`

Rich view of Claude Code agent activity. Shows per-session status when multiple agents run in the same worktree.

### `ww gc [--prune] [--dry-run]`

Garbage collection. Without flags, just empties `~/.willow/trash/`. With `--prune`, interactively removes worktrees whose branches have been merged into the base. Pair with `--dry-run` to preview before committing — useful when the user wants to see what would go before running the real thing.

```bash
ww gc                       # empty trash only
ww gc --prune               # interactively remove merged worktrees
ww gc --prune --dry-run     # preview the prune without removing anything
```

## Stacked PR workflow

Stacked PRs let you build features incrementally — each PR builds on the previous one. Willow tracks the dependency chain and can rebase the entire stack in one command.

```bash
# Create the stack
ww new feature-a -b main              # first layer (based on main)
ww new feature-b -b feature-a         # second layer (based on feature-a)
ww new feature-c -b feature-b         # third layer

# After main is updated or feature-a changes:
ww sync                                # rebases a→b→c in correct order

# Or sync just part of the stack:
ww sync feature-b                      # only feature-b and its descendants

# See the stack visually:
ww ls
#   BRANCH                STATUS  PATH                              AGE
#   ├─ feature-a          BUSY    ~/.willow/.../feature-a           2h
#   │  └─ feature-b       DONE    ~/.willow/.../feature-b           1h
#   │     └─ feature-c    --      ~/.willow/.../feature-c           30m
#   standalone            --      ~/.willow/.../standalone           1d
```

## Important rules

1. **Use `ww checkout` instead of `git checkout`** — it manages worktrees, tmux sessions, and status tracking automatically.

2. **Navigate with `wwc` or `ww sw`, not raw `cd`** — these ensure tmux sessions are created and status is tracked. Manually cd-ing to a worktree path bypasses session management.

3. **Always use `-b` for stacked branches** — `ww new child -b parent` records the parent relationship. Without `-b`, the branch won't be part of the stack and `ww sync` won't know about it.

4. **Run `ww sync` after upstream changes** — when main moves forward or a parent PR is updated, `ww sync` rebases the entire chain in the right order.

5. **Check `ww ls` for `[merged]` tags** — these indicate branches that have been merged and can be cleaned up with `ww rm` or `ww gc --prune`.

## Shell aliases

These are available after running `eval "$(willow shell-init)"`:

| Alias | Expands to |
|-------|-----------|
| `ww <cmd>` | `willow <cmd>` (with tmux-aware sw/checkout/rm) |
| `wwn <branch>` | `ww new <branch> --cd` then `cd` into result |
| `wwc <branch>` | `ww checkout <branch> --cd` then `cd` into result |
| `www` | `cd ~/.willow/worktrees/` |
