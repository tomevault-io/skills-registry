# Feature Acceptance

Systematic approach to verifying features meet requirements before release.

## Acceptance Criteria

### SMART Criteria

Every acceptance criterion should be:

- **Specific** - Clear, unambiguous requirement
- **Measurable** - Verifiable pass/fail condition
- **Achievable** - Technically feasible
- **Relevant** - Tied to user value
- **Testable** - Can be validated

### Given-When-Then Format

```gherkin
Scenario: User creates a new project
  Given I am logged in as a user
  And I am on the dashboard
  When I click "New Project"
  And I enter "My Project" as the name
  And I click "Create"
  Then I should see "My Project" in my project list
  And I should be redirected to the project page
```

## Testing Categories

### Functional Testing

Verify the feature works as specified:

- [ ] Happy path works correctly
- [ ] All specified use cases covered
- [ ] Input validation functions properly
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Edge cases handled appropriately

### Integration Testing

Verify the feature works with existing systems:

- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Database operations succeed
- [ ] Third-party integrations work
- [ ] Events/webhooks fire correctly
- [ ] Cache invalidation works

### User Experience Testing

Verify the feature is usable:

- [ ] UI matches designs/mockups
- [ ] Loading states are shown
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Responsive on all target devices

### Performance Testing

Verify the feature performs acceptably:

- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Handles expected load
- [ ] Graceful degradation under stress

### Security Testing

## Acceptance Process

### 1. Pre-Review

Developer self-check before review:

```
[ ] Code complete and tested
[ ] Unit tests written and passing
[ ] Integration tests passing
[ ] Documentation updated
[ ] No console errors/warnings
[ ] Performance acceptable
```

### 2. Peer Review

Code review by team member:

```
[ ] Code quality acceptable
[ ] Logic is correct
[ ] Tests are comprehensive
[ ] No security concerns
[ ] Follows team conventions
```

### 3. QA Review

Formal testing by QA:

```
[ ] All acceptance criteria verified
[ ] Edge cases tested
[ ] Cross-browser/device testing
[ ] Regression testing passed
[ ] Test cases documented
```

### 4. Stakeholder Review

Product/design verification:

```
[ ] Matches requirements
[ ] UX acceptable
[ ] No scope creep
[ ] Ready for users
```

```

## Release Criteria

### Definition of Done

Feature is complete when:

- [ ] All acceptance criteria pass
- [ ] No critical or high defects
- [ ] Test coverage meets threshold
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off received

### Go/No-Go Decision

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Functional tests | ✅ Pass | All 24 scenarios pass |
