# Commit

Stage changes, record observations, commit, and push.

## Phase 1: Review Changes

```powershell
git status
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Understand what changed and why. This context feeds Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Write AI Notes

**This phase is mandatory.** Every commit must evaluate whether observations belong in `.ainotes/log.md`.

### Setup (first time only)

If `.ainotes/` does not exist in the repo root:

```powershell
mkdir .ainotes
```

Create `.ainotes/memory.md`:

```markdown
# AI Notes — <project name>
```

Create `.ainotes/log.md`:

```markdown
# AI Notes — Log
```

### Append Observations

Reflect on the **entire session** — not just the diff. Consider:

- Architecture patterns or gotchas discovered
- Build/test commands that aren't documented
- Surprising behavior, race conditions, edge cases
- File relationships or conventions not obvious from code
- Dependency quirks or version constraints

**Append** to `.ainotes/log.md` using this exact format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD
- <area>: <one-line observation>
- <area>: <one-line observation>
```

If today's date header already exists, append bullets under it. Otherwise create a new header.

### What NOT to write

- Anything already in `README.md` or `AGENTS.md`
- Generic statements ("the code is well-structured")
- Descriptions of what you just changed — that's what the commit message is for

### When to skip

Only skip if **genuinely nothing new was learned** in this session. This should be rare. If you touched code, you almost certainly learned something. When in doubt, write a note.

## Phase 3: Commit

```powershell
git log -3 --oneline
```

Match the existing commit style. Stage files explicitly:

```powershell
git add <changed files>
git add .ainotes/log.md          # always include if modified
git add .ainotes/memory.md      # include if created
git add .ainotes/rules.md       # include if created or modified
```

Prefer `git add <file>` over `git add -A`.

Commit message format:

```
<type>: <short description>

<optional body explaining why>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`

## Phase 4: Push

```powershell
git push
```

If push is rejected (behind remote):

```powershell
git pull --rebase
git push
```

## Rules

- Do NOT add Co-Authored-By, Signed-off-by, or any trailer attributions
- Do NOT use `git add -A` unless every changed file should be staged
- Do NOT skip Phase 2 without explicitly stating why nothing was learned
- If on `main` or `master`, warn the user before pushing
