# Knowledge Capture - Documentation Sync from Conversations

Automatically updates project documentation based on session discoveries and learnings.

## Purpose

**Problem**: Valuable knowledge gets lost in conversations
- Debugging sessions reveal undocumented gotchas
- Architecture decisions made but not written down
- Solutions found but not added to troubleshooting guides
- Performance discoveries not captured

**Solution**: `knowledge-capture` analyzes your session and updates docs

## Quick Commands

```bash
knowledge-capture sync         # Update docs from current session
knowledge-capture discover     # Show what could be documented (dry-run)
knowledge-capture --target=docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md  # Update specific file
```

## How It Works

### 1. Session Analysis

Scans conversation for:
- **Bugs found** → docs/troubleshooting/
- **Architecture decisions** → docs/architecture/
- **Performance insights** → docs/performance/
- **Setup steps** → README.md, SETUP.md
- **Gotchas & warnings** → Relevant guide sections
- **API changes** → API documentation

### 2. Smart Categorization

Determines where to update:
```
Discovery: "Spark jobs fail with OOM when partition count < 1000"
  → Target: docs/troubleshooting/SPARK_ISSUES.md
  → Section: ## OutOfMemory Errors
  → Content: Add as known issue with solution

Decision: "Using Iceberg instead of Parquet for better schema evolution"
  → Target: docs/architecture/DATA_STORAGE.md
  → Section: ## Storage Format Choice
  → Content: Add rationale and trade-offs

Gotcha: "AWS credentials must be refreshed every 12 hours"
  → Target: SETUP.md
  → Section: ## AWS Configuration
  → Content: Add warning with solution
```

### 3. Documentation Update

Creates structured updates:
```markdown
## [Issue Type] - [Brief Title]

**Discovered**: 2025-11-20
**Context**: [Where this came from]

**Problem**: [What went wrong / what we needed to know]

**Solution**: [How we fixed it / what to do]

**Example**:
```[code/command]```

**Related**: [Links to code, commits, issues]
```

## Commands

### `knowledge-capture sync`

**Interactive mode - recommends updates**

```
Analyzing session...

Found 3 documentation opportunities:

1. Troubleshooting: Spark OOM with low partition counts
   Target: docs/troubleshooting/SPARK_ISSUES.md
   Section: ## OutOfMemory Errors

2. Architecture: Why we chose Iceberg over Parquet
   Target: docs/architecture/DATA_STORAGE.md
   Section: ## Storage Format

3. Setup gotcha: AWS credential refresh requirement
   Target: SETUP.md
   Section: ## AWS Configuration

Apply all? [y/N]: y

✅ Updated docs/troubleshooting/SPARK_ISSUES.md
✅ Updated docs/architecture/DATA_STORAGE.md
✅ Updated SETUP.md

Run "git diff" to review changes before committing.
```

### `knowledge-capture discover`

**Dry-run - shows what could be documented without making changes**

Use when:
- Want to see findings before updating
- Not sure if updates are valuable
- Just exploring what was learned

### `knowledge-capture --target=<file>`

**Update specific documentation file**

```bash
# Only update troubleshooting guide
knowledge-capture --target=docs/troubleshooting/SPARK_ISSUES.md

# Only update README
knowledge-capture --target=README.md
```

## Document Types Supported

### 1. Troubleshooting Guides

**Pattern detected:**
- Error messages in conversation
- "fixed by..." statements
- Root cause analysis

**Update format:**
```markdown
### [Error Type]: [Brief Description]

**Symptoms**: What you'll see
**Cause**: Why it happens
**Solution**: How to fix
**Prevention**: How to avoid

**Example**:
[error log snippet]
[fix command]
```

### 2. Architecture Documentation

**Pattern detected:**
- "Why we chose X over Y"
- Technology selection discussions
- Design trade-offs

**Update format:**
```markdown
## [Component/Decision]

**Decision**: What we chose
**Alternatives**: What we considered
**Rationale**: Why this choice
**Trade-offs**: Pros/cons
**Date**: When decided
```

### 3. Setup/Configuration

**Pattern detected:**
- "Had to configure X"
- "Missing prerequisite Y"
- Installation steps

**Update format:**
```markdown
## [Step/Component]

[Step-by-step instructions]

**Gotcha**: [Common issue]
**Solution**: [How to fix]
```

### 4. Performance Guides

**Pattern detected:**
- "Optimized by..."
- Performance measurements
- Benchmarking results

**Update format:**
```markdown
## [Optimization]

**Before**: [baseline metrics]
**After**: [improved metrics]
**Change**: [what we did]
**Impact**: [improvement %]
```

### 5. API Documentation

**Pattern detected:**
- New endpoints discussed
- API behavior clarified
- Request/response examples

**Update format:**
```markdown
### `[METHOD] /path/to/endpoint`

**Purpose**: What it does
**Request**: [schema/example]
**Response**: [schema/example]
**Example**:
[code]
```

## Smart Features

### Duplicate Detection

Checks existing docs before adding:
- "This OOM error already documented"
- "Similar architecture decision exists"
- Merges with existing section vs creating new

### Context Preservation

Includes:
- Session date
- Related commit SHAs
- File paths mentioned
- Commands used
- Links to relevant code

### Minimal Noise

**Won't document:**
- Trivial findings
- One-off issues
- Already well-documented topics
- Conversational noise

**Will document:**
- Non-obvious solutions
- Gotchas that wasted time
- Important architecture decisions
- Performance insights
- Setup issues that others will hit

## Integration with TaskFlow

**Works independently OR with TaskFlow:**

```bash
# Standalone usage
knowledge-capture sync

# With TaskFlow (updates both)
taskflow capture           # Updates BACKLOG with task context
knowledge-capture sync     # Updates docs with learnings

# Or combined
taskflow capture --with-docs
  → Updates BACKLOG.md with task progress
  → Updates project docs with learnings
```

## File Structure

Expects/creates:
```

```

Auto-creates missing files with templates.

## Configuration

Optional `.knowledge-capture.json`:

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "troubleshooting": "docs/troubleshooting/",
    "architecture": "docs/architecture/",
    "setup": "SETUP.md",
    "readme": "README.md"
  },
  "autoCommit": false,
  "requireApproval": true,
  "minImportance": "medium"
}
```

## Example Session

**Conversation:**
```
User: "Help debug this Spark OOM error"
[... debugging ...]
Assistant: "Found the issue - partition count was too low.
            Setting spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=2000 fixed it.
            OOMs happen when < 1000 partitions with large datasets."
```

**knowledge-capture sync detects:**
```
📚 Documentation Opportunity Detected

Type: Troubleshooting
Title: Spark OOM with Low Partition Counts
Target: docs/troubleshooting/SPARK_ISSUES.md

Proposed Update:
─────────────────────────────────────────
### OutOfMemory: Insufficient Partition Count

**Symptoms**:
- Spark executors crash with OutOfMemoryError
- Jobs succeed with small data, fail with production data

**Cause**:
Too few shuffle partitions (<1000) for large datasets

**Solution**:
```bash
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "2000")
```

**Prevention**:
Rule of thumb: 1 partition per 128MB of data

**Session**: 2025-11-20
**Related**: [commit abc123]
─────────────────────────────────────────

Add this to docs/troubleshooting/SPARK_ISSUES.md? [Y/n]:
```
