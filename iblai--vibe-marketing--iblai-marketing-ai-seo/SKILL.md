# /iblai-marketing-ai-seo

Make content discoverable, extractable, and citable by AI search systems —
Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, Copilot. The goal
is to get cited as a source in AI-generated answers.

## Step 0: Context Check

Read `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md`
on older setups) first. Only ask for what isn't there.

Pull this context:

### 1. Current AI Visibility
- Does your brand appear in AI-generated answers today?
- Have you checked ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google AI Overviews for key queries?
- Which queries matter most to the business?

### 2. Content & Domain
- Content types you produce (blog, docs, comparisons, product pages)
- Domain authority / traditional SEO strength
- Existing structured data (schema markup)?

### 3. Goals
- Get cited as a source in AI answers?
- Win AI Overviews for specific queries?
- Compete with specific brands already getting cited?
- Optimize existing content, or create new AI-optimized content?

### 4. Competitive Landscape
- Top competitors in AI search results
- Are they cited where you're not?

## How AI Search Works

### The Landscape

| Platform | How It Works | Source Selection |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Google AI Overviews** | Summarizes top-ranking pages | Strong correlation with traditional rankings |
| **ChatGPT (with search)** | Searches web, cites sources | Draws from wider range, not just top-ranked |
| **Perplexity** | Always cites sources with links | Favors authoritative, recent, well-structured content |
| **Gemini** | Google's AI assistant | Pulls from Google index + Knowledge Graph |
| **Copilot** | Bing-powered AI search | Bing index + authoritative sources |
| **Claude** | Brave Search (when enabled) | Training data + Brave search results |

Per-platform deep dive on ranking factors: [references/platform-ranking-factors.md](references/platform-ranking-factors.md).

### The Key Difference From Traditional SEO

Traditional SEO ranks you. AI SEO gets you **cited**.

In traditional search you need page 1. In AI search a well-structured page on page 2 or 3 can still get cited — AI systems pick sources by content quality, structure, and relevance, not just rank position.

**Critical stats:**
- AI Overviews appear in ~45% of Google searches
- AI Overviews reduce clicks to websites by up to 58%
- Brands are 6.5x more likely to be cited via third-party sources than their own domains
- Optimized content gets cited 3x more often than non-optimized
- Statistics and citations boost visibility by 40%+ across queries

---

## AI Visibility Audit

Audit current presence before optimizing.

### Step 1: Check AI Answers for Key Queries

Test 10-20 of your most important queries across platforms:

| Query | Google AI Overview | ChatGPT | Perplexity | You Cited? | Competitors Cited? |
|-------|:-----------------:|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------------:|
| [query 1] | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | [who] |
| [query 2] | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | [who] |

**Query types to test:**
- "What is [your product category]?"
- "Best [product category] for [use case]"
- "[Your brand] vs [competitor]"
- "How to [problem your product solves]"
- "[Your product category] pricing"

### Step 2: Citation Pattern Analysis

When competitors get cited and you don't, look at:
- **Content structure** — more extractable than yours?
- **Authority signals** — more citations, stats, expert quotes?
- **Freshness** — more recently updated?
- **Schema markup** — structured data you're missing?
- **Third-party presence** — cited via Wikipedia, Reddit, review sites?

### Step 3: Extractability Check

Per priority page:

| Check | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-----------|
| Clear definition in first paragraph? | |
| Self-contained answer blocks (work without surrounding context)? | |
| Statistics with sources cited? | |
| Comparison tables for "[X] vs [Y]" queries? | |
| FAQ section with natural-language questions? | |
| Schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Article, Product)? | |
| Expert attribution (author name, credentials)? | |
| Recently updated (within 6 months)? | |
| Heading structure matches query patterns? | |
| AI bots allowed in robots.txt? | |

### Step 4: AI Bot Access Check

Each AI platform has its own crawler. Block it and that platform can't cite you.

- **GPTBot** and **ChatGPT-User** — OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- **PerplexityBot** — Perplexity
- **ClaudeBot** and **anthropic-ai** — Anthropic (Claude)
- **Google-Extended** — Google Gemini and AI Overviews
- **Bingbot** — Microsoft Copilot (via Bing)

Audit your robots.txt for `Disallow` rules targeting these. If they're blocked, you have a business choice: blocking prevents training but also prevents citation. A middle ground is blocking training-only crawlers (like **CCBot** from Common Crawl) while allowing the search bots above.

Full robots.txt configuration: [references/platform-ranking-factors.md](references/platform-ranking-factors.md).

## Optimization Strategy

### The Three Pillars

```
1. Structure (make it extractable)
2. Authority (make it citable)
3. Presence (be where AI looks)
```

### Pillar 1: Structure — Make It Extractable

AI systems extract passages, not pages. Every key claim must work standalone.

**Content block patterns:**
- **Definition blocks** for "What is X?" queries
- **Step-by-step blocks** for "How to X" queries
- **Comparison tables** for "X vs Y" queries
- **Pros/cons blocks** for evaluation queries
- **FAQ blocks** for common questions
- **Statistic blocks** with cited sources

Block templates: [references/content-patterns.md](references/content-patterns.md).

**Structural rules:**
- Lead every section with a direct answer — don't bury it
- Hold key answer passages to 40-60 words (optimal for snippet extraction)
- H2/H3 headings that match how people phrase queries
- Tables beat prose for comparison content
- Numbered lists beat paragraphs for process content
- One clear idea per paragraph

### Pillar 2: Authority — Make It Citable

AI systems prefer sources they trust.

**The Princeton GEO research** (KDD 2024, studied across Perplexity.ai) ranked 9 optimization methods:

| Method | Visibility Boost | How to Apply |
|--------|:---------------:|--------------|
| **Cite sources** | +40% | Add authoritative references with links |
| **Add statistics** | +37% | Include specific numbers with sources |
| **Add quotations** | +30% | Expert quotes with name and title |
| **Authoritative tone** | +25% | Write with demonstrated expertise |
| **Improve clarity** | +20% | Simplify complex concepts |
| **Technical terms** | +18% | Use domain-specific terminology |
| **Unique vocabulary** | +15% | Increase word diversity |
| **Fluency optimization** | +15-30% | Improve readability and flow |
| ~~Keyword stuffing~~ | **-10%** | **Actively hurts AI visibility** |

**Best combination:** Fluency + Statistics = maximum boost. Low-ranking sites gain even more — up to 115% visibility lift with citations.

**Statistics and data** (+37-40% citation boost)
- Specific numbers with sources
- Cite original research, not summaries of research
- Date every statistic
- Original data beats aggregated data

**Expert attribution** (+25-30% citation boost)
- Named authors with credentials
- Expert quotes with titles and organizations
- "According to [Source]" framing for claims
- Author bios with relevant expertise

**Freshness signals**
- "Last updated: [date]" displayed prominently
- Regular refreshes (quarterly minimum for competitive topics)
- Current year references and recent statistics
- Remove or update stale info

**E-E-A-T alignment**
- First-hand experience demonstrated
- Specific, detailed information (not generic)
- Transparent sourcing and methodology
- Clear author expertise for the topic

### Pillar 3: Presence — Be Where AI Looks

AI doesn't only cite your website — it cites where you appear.

**Third-party sources matter more than your own site:**
- Wikipedia mentions (7.8% of all ChatGPT citations)
- Reddit discussions (1.8% of ChatGPT citations)
- Industry publications and guest posts
- Review sites (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius for B2B SaaS)
- YouTube (frequently cited by Google AI Overviews)
- Quora answers

**Actions:**
- Keep your Wikipedia page accurate and current
- Participate authentically in Reddit communities
- Get featured in industry roundups and comparison articles
- Maintain updated profiles on relevant review platforms
- Create YouTube content for key how-to queries
- Answer relevant Quora questions with depth

### Machine-Readable Files for AI Agents

AI agents aren't just answering — they're becoming buyers. When an agent evaluates tools on behalf of a user, it needs structured, parseable info. If pricing is locked in a JS-rendered page or behind a "contact sales" wall, agents skip you and recommend competitors they can actually parse.

Add these files at site root:

**`/pricing.md` or `/pricing.txt`** — Structured pricing for AI agents

```markdown
# Pricing — [Your Product Name]

## Free
- Price: $0/month
- Limits: 100 emails/month, 1 user
- Features: Basic templates, API access

## Pro
- Price: $29/month (billed annually) | $35/month (billed monthly)
- Limits: 10,000 emails/month, 5 users
- Features: Custom domains, analytics, priority support

## Enterprise
- Price: Custom — contact sales@example.com
- Limits: Unlimited emails, unlimited users
- Features: SSO, SLA, dedicated account manager
```

**Why this matters:**
- AI agents increasingly compare products programmatically before a human visits
- Opaque pricing gets filtered out of AI-mediated buying journeys
- A markdown file is trivially parseable by any LLM — no rendering, no JS, no login walls
- Same principle as `robots.txt` (for crawlers), `llms.txt` (for AI context), `AGENTS.md` (for agent capabilities)

**Rules:**
- Consistent units (monthly vs. annual, per-seat vs. flat)
- Specific limits and thresholds, not just feature names
- List what's included at each tier, not just deltas
- Keep it updated — stale pricing is worse than no file
- Link from your sitemap and main pricing page

**`/llms.txt`** — Context file for AI systems (see [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org))

If you don't have one, add an `llms.txt` that gives AI systems a quick overview of what your product does, who it's for, and links to key pages (including pricing).

### Schema Markup for AI

Structured data helps AI understand your content. Key schemas:

| Content Type | Schema | Why It Helps |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Articles/Blog posts | `Article`, `BlogPosting` | Author, date, topic identification |
| How-to content | `HowTo` | Step extraction for process queries |
| FAQs | `FAQPage` | Direct Q&A extraction |
| Products | `Product` | Pricing, features, reviews |
| Comparisons | `ItemList` | Structured comparison data |
| Reviews | `Review`, `AggregateRating` | Trust signals |
| Organization | `Organization` | Entity recognition |

Content with proper schema gets 30-40% higher AI visibility. Implementation: use the **iblai-marketing-schema-markup** skill.

## Content Types That Get Cited Most

Not all content is equally citable. Prioritize:

| Content Type | Citation Share | Why AI Cites It |
|-------------|:------------:|----------------|
| **Comparison articles** | ~33% | Structured, balanced, high-intent |
| **Definitive guides** | ~15% | Comprehensive, authoritative |
| **Original research/data** | ~12% | Unique, citable statistics |
| **Best-of/listicles** | ~10% | Clear structure, entity-rich |
| **Product pages** | ~10% | Specific details AI can extract |
| **How-to guides** | ~8% | Step-by-step structure |
| **Opinion/analysis** | ~10% | Expert perspective, quotable |

**Underperformers for citation:**
- Generic blog posts without structure
- Thin product pages with marketing fluff
- Gated content (AI can't access it)
- Content without dates or author attribution
- PDF-only content (harder for AI to parse)

---

## Monitoring AI Visibility

### What to Track

| Metric | What It Measures | How to Check |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| AI Overview presence | Do AI Overviews appear for your queries? | Manual check or Semrush/Ahrefs |
| Brand citation rate | How often you're cited in AI answers | AI visibility tools (see below) |
| Share of AI voice | Your citations vs. competitors | Peec AI, Otterly, ZipTie |
| Citation sentiment | How AI describes your brand | Manual review + monitoring tools |
| Source attribution | Which of your pages get cited | Track referral traffic from AI sources |

### Visibility Monitoring Tools

| Tool | Coverage | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Otterly AI** | ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews | Share of AI voice tracking |
| **Peec AI** | ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Copilot+ | Multi-platform monitoring at scale |
| **ZipTie** | Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity | Brand mention + sentiment tracking |
| **LLMrefs** | ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews, Gemini | SEO keyword → AI visibility mapping |

### DIY Monitoring

Monthly manual check:
1. Pick your top 20 queries
2. Run each through ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google
3. Record: Are you cited? Who is? What page?
4. Log to a spreadsheet, track month over month

## AI SEO by Content Type

### SaaS Product Pages

**Goal:** Get cited for "What is [category]?" and "Best [category]" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Clear product description in first paragraph (what it does, who it's for)
- Feature comparison tables (you vs. category, not just competitors)
- Specific metrics ("processes 10,000 transactions/sec," not "blazing fast")
- Customer count or social proof with numbers
- Visible pricing (AI cites pages with visible pricing). Add a `/pricing.md` so AI agents can parse plans without rendering your page (see "Machine-Readable Files" above)
- FAQ section covering common buyer questions

### Blog Content

**Goal:** Get cited as an authoritative source on topics in your space.

**Optimize:**
- One clear target query per post (match heading to query)
- Definition in first paragraph for "What is" queries
- Original data, research, or expert quotes
- "Last updated" date visible
- Author bio with relevant credentials
- Internal links to related product/feature pages

### Comparison / Alternative Pages

**Goal:** Get cited for "[X] vs [Y]" and "Best [X] alternatives" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Structured comparison tables (not just prose)
- Fair and balanced — AI penalizes obvious bias
- Specific criteria with ratings or scores
- Up-to-date pricing and feature data
- Build these with `/iblai-marketing-competitor-alternatives`

### Documentation / Help Content

**Goal:** Get cited for "How to [X] with [your product]" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Step-by-step format with numbered lists
- Code examples where relevant
- HowTo schema markup
- Screenshots with descriptive alt text
- Clear prerequisites and expected outcomes

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring AI search entirely** — ~45% of Google searches now show AI Overviews; ChatGPT/Perplexity are growing fast
- **Treating AI SEO as separate from SEO** — Good traditional SEO is the foundation; AI SEO layers structure and authority on top
- **Writing for AI, not humans** — If content reads like algorithm-gaming, it won't get cited or convert
- **No freshness signals** — Undated content loses to dated content; AI weights recency heavily
- **Gating everything** — AI can't access gated content. Keep your most authoritative pages open
- **Ignoring third-party presence** — You may get more citations from a Wikipedia mention than from your own blog
- **No structured data** — Schema markup gives AI explicit context about your content
- **Keyword stuffing** — Unlike traditional SEO where it's just ineffective, stuffing actively reduces AI visibility by 10% (Princeton GEO study)
- **Hiding pricing behind "contact sales" or JS-rendered pages** — AI agents evaluating you on behalf of buyers can't parse what they can't read. Add `/pricing.md`
- **Blocking AI bots** — If GPTBot, PerplexityBot, or ClaudeBot are blocked in robots.txt, those platforms can't cite you
- **Generic content without data** — "We're the best" won't get cited. "Our customers see 3x improvement in [metric]" will
- **Forgetting to monitor** — Check AI visibility at least monthly
