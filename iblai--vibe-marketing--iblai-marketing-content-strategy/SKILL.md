Plan content that drives traffic, builds authority, and generates leads.
Every piece must be searchable, shareable, or both — in that order.

## Step 0: Context Check

Read `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md`
on older setups) first. Only ask for what isn't there.

Pull this context:

### 1. Business Context
- What the company does
- Ideal customer
- Primary content goal (traffic, leads, brand, thought leadership)
- Problems the product solves

### 2. Customer Research
- Questions asked before buying
- Objections in sales calls
- Repeated themes in support tickets
- Language customers use for their problems

### 3. Current State
- Existing content; what's working
- Resources (writers, budget, time)
- Producible formats (written, video, audio)

### 4. Competitive Landscape
- Main competitors
- Content gaps in the market

---

## Searchable vs Shareable

Every piece must be searchable, shareable, or both. Prioritize searchable — search traffic is the foundation.

**Searchable content** captures existing demand. Optimized for people actively looking.

**Shareable content** creates demand. Spreads ideas, gets people talking.

### Searchable Content

- Target a specific keyword or question
- Match search intent exactly — answer what the searcher wants
- Clear titles that match search queries
- Headings that mirror search patterns
- Keywords in title, headings, first paragraph, URL
- Comprehensive coverage; don't leave questions unanswered
- Data, examples, and links to authoritative sources
- Optimize for AI/LLM discovery: clear positioning, structured content, brand consistency across the web

### Shareable Content

- Lead with a novel insight, original data, or counterintuitive take
- Challenge conventional wisdom with well-reasoned arguments
- Tell stories that make people feel something
- Make content people share to look smart or help others
- Connect to current trends or emerging problems
- Share vulnerable, honest experiences others can learn from

---

## Content Types

### Searchable Types

**Use-Case Content**
Formula: [persona] + [use-case]. Targets long-tail keywords.
- "Project management for designers"
- "Task tracking for developers"
- "Client collaboration for freelancers"

**Hub and Spoke**
Hub = comprehensive overview. Spokes = related subtopics.
```
/topic (hub)
├── /topic/subtopic-1 (spoke)
├── /topic/subtopic-2 (spoke)
└── /topic/subtopic-3 (spoke)
```
Build the hub first, then the spokes. Interlink strategically.

**Note:** Most content lives fine under `/blog`. Reserve dedicated hub/spoke URL structures for major topics with layered depth (e.g., Atlassian's `/agile` guide). For typical blog posts, `/blog/post-title` is enough.

**Template Libraries**
High-intent keywords + product adoption.
- Target searches like "marketing plan template"
- Standalone immediate value
- Show how the product enhances the template

### Shareable Types

**Thought Leadership**
- Name concepts everyone feels but hasn't named
- Challenge conventional wisdom with evidence
- Share vulnerable, honest experiences

**Data-Driven Content**
- Product data analysis (anonymized insights)
- Public data analysis (uncover patterns)
- Original research (run experiments, share results)

**Expert Roundups**
15-30 experts answering one specific question. Built-in distribution.

**Case Studies**
Structure: Challenge → Solution → Results → Key learnings

**Meta Content**
Behind-the-scenes transparency. "How We Got Our First $5k MRR," "Why We Chose Debt Over VC."

For programmatic content at scale, use `/iblai-marketing-programmatic-seo`.

## Content Pillars and Topic Clusters

Pillars are 3-5 core topics your brand will own. Each pillar spawns a cluster of related content.

Most content can live under `/blog` with good internal linking between posts. Dedicated pillar pages with custom URL structures (`/guides/topic`) are only needed when you're building comprehensive resources with multiple depth layers.

### How to Identify Pillars

1. **Product-led** — what problems does your product solve?
2. **Audience-led** — what does your ICP need to learn?
3. **Search-led** — what topics have volume in your space?
4. **Competitor-led** — what are competitors ranking for?

### Pillar Structure

```
Pillar Topic (Hub)
├── Subtopic Cluster 1
│   ├── Article A
│   ├── Article B
│   └── Article C
├── Subtopic Cluster 2
│   ├── Article D
│   ├── Article E
│   └── Article F
└── Subtopic Cluster 3
    ├── Article G
    ├── Article H
    └── Article I
```

### Pillar Criteria

Good pillars:
- Align with your product/service
- Match what your audience cares about
- Have search volume and/or social interest
- Are broad enough for many subtopics

---

## Keyword Research by Buyer Stage

Map topics to the buyer's journey using these modifiers:

### Awareness
Modifiers: `what is`, `how to`, `guide to`, `introduction to`

Example: customers ask about project management basics
- "What is Agile Project Management"
- "Guide to Sprint Planning"
- "How to Run a Standup Meeting"

### Consideration
Modifiers: `best`, `top`, `vs`, `alternatives`, `comparison`

Example: customers evaluate multiple tools
- "Best Project Management Tools for Remote Teams"
- "Asana vs Trello vs Monday"
- "Basecamp Alternatives"

### Decision
Modifiers: `pricing`, `reviews`, `demo`, `trial`, `buy`

Example: pricing comes up in sales calls
- "Project Management Tool Pricing Comparison"
- "How to Choose the Right Plan"
- "[Product] Reviews"

### Implementation
Modifiers: `templates`, `examples`, `tutorial`, `how to use`, `setup`

Example: support tickets show implementation struggles
- "Project Template Library"
- "Step-by-Step Setup Tutorial"
- "How to Use [Feature]"

---

## Ideation Sources

### 1. Keyword Data

If the user provides keyword exports (Ahrefs, SEMrush, GSC), analyze for:
- Topic clusters (group related keywords)
- Buyer stage (awareness/consideration/decision/implementation)
- Search intent (informational, commercial, transactional)
- Quick wins (low competition + decent volume + high relevance)
- Content gaps (keywords competitors rank for that you don't)

Output as a prioritized table:
| Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Buyer Stage | Content Type | Priority |

### 2. Call Transcripts

From sales or customer call transcripts:
- Questions asked → FAQ content or blog posts
- Pain points → problems in their own words
- Objections → content to address proactively
- Language patterns → exact phrases to use (voice of customer)
- Competitor mentions → what they compared you to

Output content ideas with supporting quotes.

### 3. Survey Responses

Mine for:
- Open-ended responses (topics and language)
- Common themes (30%+ mention = high priority)
- Resource requests (what they wish existed)
- Content preferences (formats they want)

### 4. Forum Research

Use web search:

**Reddit:** `site:reddit.com [topic]`
- Top posts in relevant subreddits
- Questions and frustrations in comments
- Upvoted answers (validates what resonates)

**Quora:** `site:quora.com [topic]`
- Most-followed questions
- Highly upvoted answers

**Other:** Indie Hackers, Hacker News, Product Hunt, industry Slack/Discord

Extract: FAQs, misconceptions, debates, problems being solved, terminology used.

### 5. Competitor Analysis

**Find their content:** `site:competitor.com/blog`

**Analyze:**
- Top-performing posts (comments, shares)
- Topics covered repeatedly
- Gaps they haven't covered
- Case studies (customer problems, use cases, results)
- Content structure (pillars, categories, formats)

**Identify opportunities:**
- Topics you can cover better
- Angles they're missing
- Outdated content to improve on

### 6. Sales and Support Input

From customer-facing teams:
- Common objections
- Repeated questions
- Support ticket patterns
- Success stories
- Feature requests and the problems underneath them
