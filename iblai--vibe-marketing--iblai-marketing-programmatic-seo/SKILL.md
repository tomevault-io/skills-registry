# /iblai-marketing-programmatic-seo

Build SEO-optimized pages at scale with templates and data. Pages must
rank, deliver value, and dodge thin-content penalties.

## Step 0: Context Check

Read `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md`
on older setups) first. Only ask for what isn't there.

Pin down before designing:

1. **Business context**
   - Product/service
   - Target audience
   - Conversion goal for these pages

2. **Opportunity assessment**
   - Search patterns that exist
   - Potential page count
   - Search volume distribution

3. **Competitive landscape**
   - Who ranks for these terms now
   - What their pages look like
   - Whether you can realistically compete

---

## Core Principles

1. **Unique value per page.** Every page provides value specific to it. Not just swapped variables in a template. Maximize unique content.
2. **Proprietary data wins.** Hierarchy of data defensibility:
   1. Proprietary (you created it)
   2. Product-derived (from your users)
   3. User-generated (your community)
   4. Licensed (exclusive access)
   5. Public (anyone can use — weakest)
3. **Clean URL structure.** **Use subfolders, not subdomains** — subfolders consolidate domain authority while subdomains split it:
   - Good: `yoursite.com/templates/resume/`
   - Bad: `templates.yoursite.com/resume/`
4. **Genuine search intent match.** Pages actually answer what people are searching for.
5. **Quality over quantity.** 100 great pages beat 10,000 thin ones.
6. **Avoid Google penalties.** No doorway pages. No keyword stuffing. No duplicate content. Genuine utility for users.

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Keyword Pattern Research

**Identify the pattern:**
- Repeating structure?
- Variables?
- Number of unique combinations?

**Validate demand:**
- Aggregate search volume
- Volume distribution (head vs. long tail)
- Trend direction

### 2. Data Requirements

- What data populates each page?
- First-party, scraped, licensed, or public?
- How is it updated?

### 3. Template Design

**Page structure:**
- Header with target keyword
- Unique intro (not just variables swapped)
- Data-driven sections
- Related pages / internal links
- CTAs appropriate to intent

**Ensuring uniqueness:**
- Unique value per page
- Conditional content based on data
- Original insights/analysis per page

### 4. Internal Linking Architecture

**Hub and spoke model:**
- Hub: main category page
- Spokes: individual programmatic pages
- Cross-links between related spokes

**Avoid orphan pages:**
- Every page reachable from the main site
- XML sitemap for all pages
- Breadcrumbs with structured data

### 5. Indexation Strategy

- Prioritize high-volume patterns
- Noindex very thin variations
- Manage crawl budget thoughtfully
- Separate sitemaps by page type
