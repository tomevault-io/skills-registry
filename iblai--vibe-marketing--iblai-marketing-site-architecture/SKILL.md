description: When the user wants to plan, map, or restructure their website's page hierarchy, navigation, URL structure, or internal linking. Also use when the user mentions "sitemap," "site map," "visual sitemap," "site structure," "page hierarchy," "information architecture," "IA," "navigation design," "URL structure," "breadcrumbs," "internal linking strategy," "website planning," "what pages do I need," "how should I organize my site," or "site navigation." Use this whenever someone is planning what pages a website should have and how they connect. NOT for XML sitemaps (that's technical SEO — see iblai-marketing-seo-audit). For SEO audits, see iblai-marketing-seo-audit. For structured data, see iblai-marketing-schema-markup. Use when this capability is needed.

# /iblai-marketing-site-architecture

Plan website structure — page hierarchy, navigation, URL patterns,
internal linking — so the site is intuitive for users and optimized for
search.

## Step 0: Context Check

Read `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md`
on older setups) first. Only ask for what isn't there.

Pull this context:

### 1. Business Context
- What the company does
- Primary audiences
- Top 3 goals for the site (conversions, SEO traffic, education, support)

### 2. Current State
- New site or restructure?
- If restructuring: what's broken? (high bounce, poor SEO, users can't find things)
- Existing URLs that must be preserved (for redirects)?

### 3. Site Type
- SaaS marketing site
- Content/blog site
- E-commerce
- Documentation
- Hybrid (SaaS + content)
- Small business / local

### 4. Content Inventory
- Pages existing or planned
- Most important pages (by traffic, conversions, or business value)
- Planned sections or expansions

## Site Types and Starting Points

| Site Type | Typical Depth | Key Sections | URL Pattern |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| SaaS marketing | 2-3 levels | Home, Features, Pricing, Blog, Docs | `/features/name`, `/blog/slug` |
| Content/blog | 2-3 levels | Home, Blog, Categories, About | `/blog/slug`, `/category/slug` |
| E-commerce | 3-4 levels | Home, Categories, Products, Cart | `/category/subcategory/product` |
| Documentation | 3-4 levels | Home, Guides, API Reference | `/docs/section/page` |
| Hybrid SaaS+content | 3-4 levels | Home, Product, Blog, Resources, Docs | `/product/feature`, `/blog/slug` |
| Small business | 1-2 levels | Home, Services, About, Contact | `/services/name` |

## Page Hierarchy Design

### The 3-Click Rule

Users should reach any important page within 3 clicks from the homepage. Not absolute — but if critical pages are buried 4+ levels deep, something is wrong.

### Flat vs. Deep

| Approach | Best For | Tradeoff |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Flat (2 levels) | Small sites, portfolios | Simple but doesn't scale |
| Moderate (3 levels) | Most SaaS, content sites | Good balance of depth and findability |
| Deep (4+ levels) | E-commerce, large docs | Scales but risks burying content |

**Rule of thumb:** as flat as possible while keeping navigation clean. If a nav dropdown has 20+ items, add a level of hierarchy.

### Hierarchy Levels

| Level | What It Is | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| L0 | Homepage | `/` |
| L1 | Primary sections | `/features`, `/blog`, `/pricing` |
| L2 | Section pages | `/features/analytics`, `/blog/seo-guide` |
| L3+ | Detail pages | `/docs/api/authentication` |

### ASCII Tree Format

Use this format for page hierarchies:

```
Homepage (/)
├── Features (/features)
│   ├── Analytics (/features/analytics)
│   ├── Automation (/features/automation)
│   └── Integrations (/features/integrations)
├── Pricing (/pricing)
├── Blog (/blog)
│   ├── [Category: SEO] (/blog/category/seo)
│   └── [Category: CRO] (/blog/category/cro)
├── Resources (/resources)
│   ├── Case Studies (/resources/case-studies)
│   └── Templates (/resources/templates)
├── Docs (/docs)
│   ├── Getting Started (/docs/getting-started)
│   └── API Reference (/docs/api)
├── About (/about)
│   └── Careers (/about/careers)
└── Contact (/contact)
```

**When to use ASCII vs. Mermaid:**
- ASCII: quick hierarchy drafts, text-only contexts, simple structures
- Mermaid: visual presentations, complex relationships, nav zones or linking patterns

## Navigation Design

### Navigation Types

| Nav Type | Purpose | Placement |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Header nav | Primary navigation, always visible | Top of every page |
| Dropdown menus | Organize sub-pages under parent | Expands from header items |
| Footer nav | Secondary links, legal, sitemap | Bottom of every page |
| Sidebar nav | Section navigation (docs, blog) | Left side within a section |
| Breadcrumbs | Show current location in hierarchy | Below header, above content |
| Contextual links | Related content, next steps | Within page content |

### Header Navigation Rules

- **4-7 items max** in primary nav (more causes decision paralysis)
- **CTA button** goes rightmost (e.g., "Start Free Trial," "Get Started")
- **Logo** links to homepage (left side)
- **Order by priority** — most important/visited pages first
- If using a mega menu, cap at 3-4 columns

### Footer Organization

Group footer links into columns:
- **Product**: Features, Pricing, Integrations, Changelog
- **Resources**: Blog, Case Studies, Templates, Docs
- **Company**: About, Careers, Contact, Press
- **Legal**: Privacy, Terms, Security

### Breadcrumb Format

```
Home > Features > Analytics
Home > Blog > SEO Category > Post Title
```

Breadcrumbs mirror the URL hierarchy. Every segment is a clickable link except the current page.

Detailed navigation patterns: [references/navigation-patterns.md](references/navigation-patterns.md).

## URL Structure

### Design Principles

1. **Readable by humans** — `/features/analytics`, not `/f/a123`
2. **Hyphens, not underscores** — `/blog/seo-guide`, not `/blog/seo_guide`
3. **Reflect the hierarchy** — URL path matches site structure
4. **Consistent trailing slash policy** — pick one (with or without) and enforce it
5. **Lowercase always** — `/About` redirects to `/about`
6. **Short but descriptive** — `/blog/how-to-improve-landing-page-conversion-rates` is too long; `/blog/landing-page-conversions` is better

### URL Patterns by Page Type

| Page Type | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Homepage | `/` | `example.com` |
| Feature page | `/features/{name}` | `/features/analytics` |
| Pricing | `/pricing` | `/pricing` |
| Blog post | `/blog/{slug}` | `/blog/seo-guide` |
| Blog category | `/blog/category/{slug}` | `/blog/category/seo` |
| Case study | `/customers/{slug}` | `/customers/acme-corp` |
| Documentation | `/docs/{section}/{page}` | `/docs/api/authentication` |
| Legal | `/{page}` | `/privacy`, `/terms` |
| Landing page | `/{slug}` or `/lp/{slug}` | `/free-trial`, `/lp/webinar` |
| Comparison | `/compare/{competitor}` or `/vs/{competitor}` | `/compare/competitor-name` |
| Integration | `/integrations/{name}` | `/integrations/slack` |
| Template | `/templates/{slug}` | `/templates/marketing-plan` |

### Common Mistakes

- **Dates in blog URLs** — `/blog/2024/01/15/post-title` adds no value. Use `/blog/post-title`.
- **Over-nesting** — `/products/category/subcategory/item/detail` is too deep. Flatten where possible.
- **Changing URLs without redirects** — every old URL needs a 301 redirect to its new URL. Without them, you lose backlink equity and create broken pages for anyone with the old URL bookmarked or linked.
- **IDs in URLs** — `/product/12345` is not human-readable. Use slugs.
- **Query parameters for content** — `/blog?id=123` should be `/blog/post-title`.
- **Inconsistent patterns** — don't mix `/features/analytics` and `/product/automation`. Pick one parent.

### Breadcrumb-URL Alignment

The breadcrumb trail mirrors the URL path:

| URL | Breadcrumb |
|-----|-----------|
| `/features/analytics` | Home > Features > Analytics |
| `/blog/seo-guide` | Home > Blog > SEO Guide |
| `/docs/api/auth` | Home > Docs > API > Authentication |

## Visual Sitemap Output (Mermaid)

Use Mermaid `graph TD` for visual sitemaps. Makes hierarchy clear and can annotate navigation zones.

### Basic Hierarchy

```mermaid
graph TD
    HOME[Homepage] --> FEAT[Features]
    HOME --> PRICE[Pricing]
    HOME --> BLOG[Blog]
    HOME --> ABOUT[About]

    FEAT --> F1[Analytics]
    FEAT --> F2[Automation]
    FEAT --> F3[Integrations]

    BLOG --> B1[Post 1]
    BLOG --> B2[Post 2]
```

### With Navigation Zones

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Header Nav
        HOME[Homepage]
        FEAT[Features]
        PRICE[Pricing]
        BLOG[Blog]
        CTA[Get Started]
    end

    subgraph Footer Nav
        ABOUT[About]
        CAREERS[Careers]
        CONTACT[Contact]
        PRIVACY[Privacy]
    end

    HOME --> FEAT
    HOME --> PRICE
    HOME --> BLOG
    HOME --> ABOUT

    FEAT --> F1[Analytics]
    FEAT --> F2[Automation]
```

## Internal Linking Strategy

### Link Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Navigational | Move between sections | Header, footer, sidebar links |
| Contextual | Related content within text | "Learn more about [analytics](/features/analytics)" |
| Hub-and-spoke | Connect cluster content to hub | Blog posts linking to pillar page |
| Cross-section | Connect related pages across sections | Feature page linking to related case study |

### Internal Linking Rules

1. **No orphan pages** — every page has at least one internal link pointing to it
2. **Descriptive anchor text** — "our analytics features," not "click here"
3. **5-10 internal links per 1000 words** of content (approximate)
4. **Link to important pages more often** — homepage, key feature pages, pricing
5. **Use breadcrumbs** — free internal links on every page
6. **Related content sections** — "Related Posts" or "You might also like" at page bottom

### Hub-and-Spoke Model

For content-heavy sites, organize around hub pages:

```
Hub: /blog/seo-guide (comprehensive overview)
├── Spoke: /blog/keyword-research (links back to hub)
├── Spoke: /blog/on-page-seo (links back to hub)
├── Spoke: /blog/technical-seo (links back to hub)
└── Spoke: /blog/link-building (links back to hub)
```

Each spoke links back to the hub. The hub links to all spokes. Spokes link to each other where relevant.

### Link Audit Checklist

- [ ] Every page has at least one inbound internal link
- [ ] No broken internal links (404s)
- [ ] Anchor text is descriptive (not "click here" or "read more")
- [ ] Important pages have the most inbound internal links
- [ ] Breadcrumbs implemented on all pages
- [ ] Related content links exist on blog posts
- [ ] Cross-section links connect features to case studies, blog to product pages

## Output Format

When delivering a site architecture plan, ship:

### 1. Page Hierarchy (ASCII Tree)
Full site structure with URLs at each node. Use the ASCII tree format above.

### 2. Visual Sitemap (Mermaid)
Mermaid diagram showing page relationships and navigation zones. Use `graph TD` with subgraphs for nav zones where helpful.

### 3. URL Map Table

| Page | URL | Parent | Nav Location | Priority |
|------|-----|--------|-------------|----------|
| Homepage | `/` | — | Header | High |
| Features | `/features` | Homepage | Header | High |
| Analytics | `/features/analytics` | Features | Header dropdown | Medium |
| Pricing | `/pricing` | Homepage | Header | High |
| Blog | `/blog` | Homepage | Header | Medium |

### 4. Navigation Spec
- Header nav items (ordered, with CTA)
- Footer sections and links
- Sidebar nav (if applicable)
- Breadcrumb implementation notes

### 5. Internal Linking Plan
- Hub pages and their spokes
- Cross-section link opportunities
- Orphan page audit (if restructuring)
- Recommended links per key page
