description: Enforces the gutt GitHub workflow: commit to feature branches, create PRs, request Copilot review before merge. Use this skill whenever interacting with GitHub repos — creating PRs, pushing code, branching, reviewing, or any git operation via GitHub MCP. Triggers on: push, commit, PR, pull request, merge, github, branch, deploy, release, code review. Even if the user doesn't explicitly mention GitHub, use this skill when the task involves code delivery to a repository. Use when this capability is needed.

# GitHub Workflow

**Announce:** "Following gutt GitHub workflow..."

## The Rule

All code changes go through PRs with Copilot review. This is the quality gate — Copilot reviews every PR and does one last iteration before the code lands.

Committing to feature branches is fine and expected. What's not allowed is pushing directly to the default branch or merging without Copilot review.

## What You Can and Can't Do

**Go ahead:**

- Create branches (`mcp__github__create_branch`)
- Commit files to feature branches (`mcp__github__push_files`, `mcp__github__create_or_update_file`)
- Create PRs (`mcp__github__create_pull_request`)
- Request Copilot review (`mcp__github__request_copilot_review`)
- Read anything — files, commits, diffs, PRs, issues
- Search code, issues, PRs
- Create/update issues
- Update PR metadata

**Always ask the user first:**

- Merging PRs (`mcp__github__merge_pull_request`) — the user or Copilot workflow handles this

**Never do:**

- Push directly to `master` or `main`
- Merge without Copilot having reviewed

## Standard Workflow

When delivering code to GitHub, follow this sequence:

1. **Create a feature branch** from the repo's default branch (e.g., `master` or `main`)
2. **Push your code** to the feature branch via `mcp__github__push_files` (preferred for multiple files) or `mcp__github__create_or_update_file`
3. **Create a PR** with a clear title referencing any Jira ticket, and a body describing what changed and why
4. **Request Copilot review** immediately after PR creation via `mcp__github__request_copilot_review`
5. **Stop** — let Copilot review and the user decide when to merge

The reason for this workflow is that Copilot catches issues that local testing misses — style inconsistencies, edge cases, potential regressions. Having every change reviewed before it lands in the default branch keeps the codebase healthy.

## PR Format

Title: `type(TICKET-ID): short description` — e.g., `feat(GP-530): Cowork automatic lesson capture`

Body should include:

- Summary of what changed (bullet points are fine)
- Files changed with brief descriptions
- Link to Jira ticket if applicable
- Test results if tests were run
- Acceptance criteria checklist if from a spec

## Repository Details

The organization is **iBrain-BVBA**. Always use `iBrain-BVBA` as the owner for GitHub MCP calls.

Key repos:

- `gutt-claude-code-plugin` — Claude Code/Cowork plugin (hooks, skills, MCP)

If unsure about a repo name, search with `mcp__github__search_repositories` first.

## Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits: `type(scope): description`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`

Include `Co-Authored-By: Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>` (use your actual model name, e.g. `Claude Opus 4.6`) when Claude authored the code.
