# EARS Notation for Requirements Engineering

EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) is a formal notation for writing unambiguous, testable acceptance criteria.

## Core Principle

Every acceptance criterion follows a strict pattern with uppercase keywords. The keyword **SHALL** is mandatory - never use "should", "must", "will", "can", or "may".

## The Six EARS Patterns

### 1. Ubiquitous (Always True)
```
THE [System] SHALL [behavior]
```
Use for requirements that are always active, with no preconditions.

**Example:** THE System SHALL encrypt all passwords using bcrypt

### 2. Event-Driven (Triggered by Action)
```
WHEN [event] THE [System] SHALL [response]
```
Use when a specific trigger causes behavior.

**Example:** WHEN a user submits the login form THE System SHALL validate credentials

### 3. State-Driven (Ongoing Condition)
```
WHILE [state] THE [System] SHALL [behavior]
```
Use for behavior that continues as long as a condition is true.

**Example:** WHILE the user is authenticated THE System SHALL display the dashboard

### 4. Optional Feature
```
WHERE [feature is present] THE [System] SHALL [behavior]
```
Use for behavior dependent on a feature flag or configuration.

**Example:** WHERE two-factor authentication is enabled THE System SHALL require a verification code

### 5. Error Handling / Unwanted Behavior
```
IF [condition] THEN THE [System] SHALL [response]
```
Use for error cases, edge cases, and exception handling.

**Example:** IF the password is incorrect THEN THE System SHALL display an error message

### 6. Complex (Combined Conditions)
```
WHILE [state] WHEN [event] THE [System] SHALL [response]
```
Use when both a state and an event trigger behavior.

**Example:** WHILE the cart is not empty WHEN the user clicks checkout THE System SHALL navigate to payment

## Strict Rules

1. **Keywords MUST be UPPERCASE**: WHEN, THE, SHALL, IF, THEN, WHILE, WHERE
2. **Always use "THE [System]"** - never lowercase "the system"
3. **Only use SHALL** - reject "should", "must", "will", "can", "may"
4. **Be specific** - avoid vague terms like "appropriate", "quickly", "properly"
5. **Make it testable** - each criterion should be verifiable

## Pattern Selection Guide

| Scenario | Pattern | Keywords |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Always happens | Ubiquitous | THE...SHALL |
| User action triggers | Event-Driven | WHEN...THE...SHALL |
| During a state | State-Driven | WHILE...THE...SHALL |
| Feature-dependent | Optional | WHERE...THE...SHALL |
| Error/edge case | Error Handling | IF...THEN THE...SHALL |
| State + action | Complex | WHILE...WHEN...THE...SHALL |

## Common Mistakes

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| "The system should..." | "THE System SHALL..." |
| "When clicking..." | "WHEN the user clicks... THE System SHALL..." |
| "Must validate..." | "THE System SHALL validate..." |
| "Handle errors appropriately" | "IF validation fails THEN THE System SHALL display..." |

- **`examples/good-requirements.md`** - Complete example requirements document

## Validation

To validate EARS syntax, use the ears-validator script:
```bash
node scripts/ears-validator.js .specs/<feature>/requirements.md
```
