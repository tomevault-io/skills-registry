- GPT 5.1, GPT 5.1 Codex
- Gemini Pro 3.0

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when the user requests:

- Troubleshooting poor model performance

## Core Prompt Engineering Techniques

Six universal techniques apply across all models:

| Technique | When to Use | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **XML Tags** | 3+ components, structured output | High - clear separation |
| **Role Prompting** | Domain expertise needed | Medium - contextual knowledge |
| **Clear & Direct** | Always (baseline) | Critical - foundation |
| **Multishot Prompting** | Format/style consistency | High - 40-60% improvement |
| **Chain of Thought** | Complex reasoning | High - accuracy boost |
| **Prompt Chaining** | Multi-stage workflows | High - manages complexity |

**Technique Selection Matrix:**

| Task Type | Recommended Techniques |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Simple question/task | Clear & Direct |
| Classification/extraction | Clear & Direct + Examples |
| Analysis/reasoning | Clear & Direct + Chain of Thought |
| Domain-specific task | Clear & Direct + Role Prompting |
| Complex structured output | Clear & Direct + XML Tags + Examples |
| Multi-step process | Clear & Direct + Prompt Chaining |

## Prompt Engineering Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Requirements

Gather essential information:
- Task purpose and success criteria
- Target model (if specified) or requirements for recommendation
- Input and output format requirements
- Constraints (length, style, format)
- Current issues (for optimization requests)

### Step 2: Select or Recommend Model

**If model specified:** Load the corresponding model guide from `reference/models/`.

**If model not specified:** Gather requirements via interactive dialog:
1. Task type (code, analysis, creative, data, conversation)
2. Priority (speed, quality, cost, balance)
3. Context size requirements
4. Special features needed (vision, function calling, JSON mode)

Then consult `reference/comparisons/model-comparison-matrix.md` and `reference/comparisons/use-case-recommendations.md`.

### Step 3: Select Techniques

Always start with Clear & Direct (foundation technique).

Add based on needs:
- **XML Tags:** Complex structure, 3+ components
- **Role Prompting:** Domain expertise required
- **Examples:** Format consistency needed
- **Chain of Thought:** Reasoning tasks
- **Prompt Chaining:** Multi-stage workflows

### Step 4: Load References

Load technique documentation from `reference/techniques/`:
- Always load: `03-be-clear-and-direct.md`
- Add as needed: Relevant technique files

Load model guide from `reference/models/`:
- Target model optimization guide

### Step 5: Draft or Optimize Prompt

**For new prompts:**
1. Apply selected techniques systematically
2. Structure with XML tags if appropriate
3. Add examples if format matters
4. Include model-specific optimizations

**For optimization:**
1. Analyze current prompt against checklist
2. Identify missing or misapplied techniques
3. Apply fixes systematically
4. Add model-specific optimizations

### Step 6: Validate

Use `reference/optimization/optimization-checklist.md` to verify:
- Clarity and completeness
- Proper technique application
- Model-specific requirements met
- No common pitfalls

### Step 7: Deliver

Provide:
1. Complete prompt (ready to use)
2. Technique explanation (what was applied and why)
3. Usage instructions (how to use, variables to replace)
4. Testing recommendations (how to verify it works)

## Key Principles

### 1. Clarity is Foundational

Every prompt must have clear context, explicit instructions, defined success criteria, and specified output format. Without clarity, other techniques cannot compensate.

### 2. Match Technique to Task

Simple tasks need simple prompts. Complex tasks benefit from multiple techniques. Match complexity to actual need.

### 3. Model-Specific Optimization Matters

Each model has unique characteristics. Apply model-specific optimizations after general techniques for best results.

### 4. Test and Iterate

First drafts rarely perfect. Test with real inputs, identify failure modes, refine systematically.

### 5. Progressive Disclosure

Load detailed references only when needed. Start with core workflow, dive into specifics as required.
