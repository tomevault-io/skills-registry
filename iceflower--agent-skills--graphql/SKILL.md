# GraphQL API Design and Implementation Rules

## 1. Schema Design Principles

### SDL-first vs Code-first

- **SDL-first** (recommended for most projects): Define the schema in `.graphqls`
  files, then implement resolvers to match
  - Encourages contract-first design — schema is the API contract
  - Better for team collaboration — frontend and backend agree on schema first
  - Tools: Spring for GraphQL, Apollo Server
- **Code-first**: Generate the schema from code annotations or DSL
  - Useful when schema closely mirrors domain model
  - Risk of coupling schema to implementation details
  - Tools: Netflix DGS (annotation-based), GraphQL Kotlin, TypeGraphQL

### Schema Organization

```text
src/main/resources/graphql/
  schema.graphqls          # Root schema (Query, Mutation, Subscription)
  types/
    user.graphqls          # User-related types
    order.graphqls         # Order-related types
  inputs/
    user-input.graphqls    # User input types
  enums/
    status.graphqls        # Enum definitions
  interfaces/
    node.graphqls          # Shared interfaces
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Types**: PascalCase (`User`, `OrderItem`)
- **Fields**: camelCase (`firstName`, `createdAt`)
- **Enums**: PascalCase type, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE values (`OrderStatus.IN_PROGRESS`)
- **Mutations**: verb + noun (`createUser`, `updateOrder`, `deleteComment`)
- **Queries**: noun for single (`user`), plural for list (`users`)
- **Input types**: suffix with `Input` (`CreateUserInput`, `UpdateOrderInput`)
- **Payload types**: suffix with `Payload` (`CreateUserPayload`)

---

## 2. Type System

### Object Types

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
  name: String!
  avatar: String
  orders(first: Int, after: String): OrderConnection!
  createdAt: DateTime!
}
```

- Use `ID!` for identifiers — never `Int!` or `String!`
- Mark required fields with `!` (non-null)
- Use nullable fields (`String`) for optional data
- Add arguments to fields for filtering/pagination

### Input Types

```graphql
input CreateUserInput {
  email: String!
  name: String!
  avatar: String
}

input UpdateUserInput {
  email: String
  name: String
  avatar: String
}
```

- Separate input types for create and update operations
- Create inputs: required fields are non-null
- Update inputs: all fields nullable (partial update)
- Never reuse output types as input types

### Interface Types

```graphql
interface Node {
  id: ID!
}

interface Timestamped {
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type User implements Node & Timestamped {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```

- Use interfaces for shared field contracts
- `Node` interface is standard for Relay-compatible APIs

### Union Types

```graphql
union SearchResult = User | Order | Product

type Query {
  search(term: String!): [SearchResult!]!
}
```

- Use unions when return types share no common fields
- Prefer interfaces when types share fields
- Always handle all union members in the client

### Enum Types

```graphql
enum OrderStatus {
  PENDING
  CONFIRMED
  SHIPPED
  DELIVERED
  CANCELLED
}
```

- Use enums for fixed sets of values
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for values
- Add descriptions for non-obvious values

### Custom Scalar Types

```graphql
scalar DateTime
scalar URL
scalar JSON
scalar BigDecimal
```

- Define custom scalars for domain-specific types
- Always provide serialization/deserialization logic
- Prefer specific scalars over `String` for validation

---

## 3. Resolver Patterns and DataLoader

### Resolver Structure

```text
Query.user(id) → UserResolver
  User.orders → OrderResolver (field resolver)
    Order.items → OrderItemResolver (field resolver)
```

- Keep resolvers thin — delegate business logic to service layer
- One resolver class per type or domain area
- Field resolvers load data lazily — only when requested

> See [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md) for N+1 problem explanation, DataLoader implementation example, and mutation error patterns.

### DataLoader Rules

- Always use DataLoader for field resolvers that load related entities
- DataLoader batches requests within a single request context
- DataLoader also provides per-request caching
- Monitor batch sizes — unexpectedly large batches may indicate issues

### Resolver Best Practices

- Never call repositories directly from resolvers — use a service layer
- Handle null values explicitly in resolvers
- Use `@Secured` or custom directives for field-level authorization
- Log resolver errors with correlation IDs for debugging

---

## 4. Pagination

### Cursor-based Pagination (Relay Connection Spec)

```graphql
type Query {
  users(first: Int, after: String, last: Int, before: String): UserConnection!
}

type UserConnection {
  edges: [UserEdge!]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
  totalCount: Int!
}

type UserEdge {
  node: User!
  cursor: String!
}

type PageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String
  endCursor: String
}
```

### Pagination Guidelines

- Prefer cursor-based over offset-based pagination
  - Cursor-based: stable under concurrent inserts/deletes
  - Offset-based: simple but breaks with data changes
- Cursors should be opaque strings (base64-encoded IDs)
- Always include `totalCount` when feasible
- Set reasonable defaults and maximums for `first`/`last` (e.g., default 20,
  max 100)
- For simple use cases, offset-based pagination is acceptable:

```graphql
type Query {
  users(page: Int = 1, size: Int = 20): UserPage!
}

type UserPage {
  content: [User!]!
  totalElements: Int!
  totalPages: Int!
  hasNext: Boolean!
}
```

## 5. Error Handling

### GraphQL Error Response Structure

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "User not found",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["user"],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "NOT_FOUND",
        "classification": "DataFetchingException"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns

- Use `extensions.code` for machine-readable error codes
- Define a consistent set of error codes across the API:
  - `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`,
    `INTERNAL_ERROR`, `CONFLICT`, `RATE_LIMITED`
- Return partial data when possible — GraphQL supports partial responses
- Never expose internal details (stack traces, SQL) in error messages

- Use union return types for mutations to provide typed error responses (see [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md) for union-based mutation error pattern examples)

---

## 6. Query Complexity and Depth Limiting

### Depth Limiting

- Set a maximum query depth (recommended: 7-10 for general APIs)
- Reject queries exceeding the depth limit before execution

```graphql
# This nested query could be malicious if unbounded:
{
  user {
    friends {
      friends {
        friends {
          friends { ... }  # Excessive depth
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- Assign complexity scores to fields based on cost:
  - Scalar fields: 0-1
  - Object fields: 1
  - List fields: multiply by expected/requested count
  - Database-heavy fields: higher weight
- Set a maximum total complexity per query (e.g., 1000)
- Return the complexity cost in response extensions for transparency

> For DGS framework configuration example, see [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md).

---

## 7. Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication

- Authenticate at the transport layer (HTTP headers, cookies)
- Pass the authenticated user context to resolvers via GraphQL context
- Do NOT put authentication logic inside individual resolvers

### Field-Level Authorization

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!                  # Public
  email: String! @auth(role: SELF)     # Only the user themselves
  salary: BigDecimal @auth(role: ADMIN) # Admin only
}
```

- Use custom directives or schema annotations for declarative authorization
- Implement authorization in a middleware/interceptor layer, not in
  business logic
- Return `null` for unauthorized nullable fields; throw for non-null fields
- Log authorization failures for security monitoring

### Authorization Patterns

- **Directive-based**: `@auth(role: ADMIN)` on schema fields
- **Resolver-based**: Check permissions in the resolver or service layer
- **DataLoader-based**: Filter results in DataLoader based on context

---

## 8. Subscriptions (Real-time)

### Subscription Design

```graphql
type Subscription {
  orderStatusChanged(orderId: ID!): OrderStatusEvent!
  newMessage(channelId: ID!): Message!
}

type OrderStatusEvent {
  order: Order!
  previousStatus: OrderStatus!
  newStatus: OrderStatus!
  changedAt: DateTime!
}
```

### Implementation Guidelines

- Use WebSocket (graphql-ws protocol) for subscriptions
- Keep subscription payloads small — include only changed data
- Always require authentication for subscriptions
- Set connection timeouts and maximum subscription limits per client
- Use server-sent events (SSE) as an alternative for simpler use cases
- Consider using a message broker (Redis Pub/Sub, Kafka) for scalability

---

## 9. Federation (Apollo Federation)

### When to Use Federation

- Multiple teams own different parts of the graph
- Microservice architecture where each service owns its domain types
- Need to compose a unified schema from independent subgraphs

> For subgraph schema examples, see [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md).

### Federation Guidelines

- Each entity has exactly one owning subgraph
- Use `@key` directive to define entity identity
- Use `@external`, `@requires`, `@provides` for cross-subgraph fields
- Keep the gateway/router stateless — all logic in subgraphs
- Monitor subgraph latency — gateway adds overhead
- Version subgraphs independently; use schema registry for compatibility

---

## 10. Security

> For the full security reference, see the OWASP GraphQL Cheat Sheet.

### Introspection

- **Disable introspection in production** — it exposes the full schema
- Enable only in development/staging environments

### Query Restrictions

- Set maximum query depth (see Section 6)
- Set maximum query complexity (see Section 6)
- Limit batch queries (array of operations in single request)
- Set request size limits at the HTTP layer
- Implement rate limiting per client/IP

### Input Validation

- Validate all input arguments at the schema level (non-null, enums)
- Add custom validation in resolvers for business rules
- Sanitize string inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use custom scalars with built-in validation (e.g., `Email`, `URL`)

### Persisted Queries

- Use automatic persisted queries (APQ) or pre-registered queries in
  production
- APQ: client sends a hash; server looks up the query
- Prevents arbitrary query execution in sensitive environments
- Reduces bandwidth by not sending full query strings

### Additional Security Measures

- Enable CORS with strict origin policies
- Use HTTPS for all GraphQL endpoints
- Log and monitor query patterns for anomaly detection
- Set timeouts for resolver execution to prevent resource exhaustion

---

## 11. GraphQL vs REST Selection Criteria

### Prefer GraphQL When

- Clients need flexible data fetching (mobile vs web different needs)
- Multiple related entities are fetched in a single request
- API serves diverse clients with varying data requirements
- Real-time features (subscriptions) are needed
- Rapid frontend iteration without backend changes

### Prefer REST When

- Simple CRUD operations on well-defined resources
- File upload/download is a primary use case
- Caching at the HTTP layer (CDN, browser) is critical
- Team has limited GraphQL experience
- API is primarily server-to-server communication
- OpenAPI/Swagger tooling ecosystem is a requirement

### Hybrid Approach

- Use GraphQL for client-facing APIs with complex data requirements
- Use REST for internal service-to-service communication
- Use REST for file handling, health checks, and webhook endpoints
- A single application can expose both GraphQL and REST endpoints
