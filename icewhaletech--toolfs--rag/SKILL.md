# ToolFS RAG

Semantic search over vector databases for document retrieval. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enables finding relevant documents and content based on semantic similarity rather than exact keyword matches.

## How It Works

1. **Vector Search**: Queries are converted to embeddings and compared against document vectors
2. **Similarity Scoring**: Results are ranked by semantic similarity scores
3. **Top-K Results**: Returns the most relevant documents up to the specified limit
4. **Metadata Filtering**: Results include metadata for context and filtering

## Usage

### Semantic Search

**ToolFS Path:**
```
/toolfs/rag/query?text=<query_text>&top_k=<number>
```

**Parameters:**
- `text` or `q`: The search query (URL-encoded)
- `top_k`: Number of results to return (default: 5)

**Example:**
```json
GET /toolfs/rag/query?text=ToolFS%20skill%20architecture&top_k=3

// Response
{
  "query": "ToolFS skill architecture",
  "top_k": 3,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "doc-001",
      "content": "ToolFS provides a skill system that supports WASM modules for sandboxed execution. Skills can be mounted to virtual paths and executed through the Skill API.",
      "score": 0.95,
      "metadata": {
        "source": "documentation",
        "section": "skills",
        "title": "Skill System Overview"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "doc-002",
      "content": "The skill architecture allows mounting custom handlers to virtual paths, enabling extensible functionality within the ToolFS framework.",
      "score": 0.87,
      "metadata": {
        "source": "documentation",
        "section": "architecture",
        "title": "Architecture Design"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "doc-003",
      "content": "WASM skills are executed in a sandboxed environment with resource limits and security constraints to ensure safe operation.",
      "score": 0.82,
      "metadata": {
        "source": "documentation",
        "section": "sandboxing",
        "title": "Security Model"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## When to Use This Skill

Use RAG skill when you need to:

- **Semantic Search**: Find documents based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Query a knowledge base or document collection
- **Context Gathering**: Gather relevant context for generating responses
- **Document Discovery**: Discover related content across a corpus

Common use cases:
- "Search for information about ToolFS skills"
- "Find documents related to vector databases"
- "Query the knowledge base for best practices"
- "Find relevant documentation about RAG systems"

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `text` or `q` | string | Yes | - | Search query text (URL-encoded) |
| `top_k` | integer | No | 5 | Number of results to return |

## Result Structure

Each result includes:

- **id**: Document identifier
- **content**: Document content snippet
- **score**: Similarity score (0.0 to 1.0, higher is better)
- **metadata**: Optional metadata (source, title, section, etc.)

## Output Format

RAG operations return standardized result structures:

```json
{
  "type": "rag",
  "source": "/toolfs/rag/query",
  "content": {
    "query": "...",
    "top_k": 3,
    "results": [...]
  },
  "success": true,
  "error": "error message if failed"
}
```

## Present Results to User

When presenting RAG search results:

```
✓ RAG search completed

Query: ToolFS skill architecture
Results: 3 matches found

1. doc-001 (score: 0.95)
   Source: documentation > skills
   Title: Skill System Overview
   Content: ToolFS provides a skill system that supports WASM modules...

2. doc-002 (score: 0.87)
   Source: documentation > architecture
   Title: Architecture Design
   Content: The skill architecture allows mounting custom handlers...

3. doc-003 (score: 0.82)
   Source: documentation > sandboxing
   Title: Security Model
   Content: WASM skills are executed in a sandboxed environment...
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Found

If search returns no results:

1. Try a different query or rephrase the search
2. Reduce specificity to broaden results
3. Verify the RAG store is populated with documents
4. Check if the query is properly URL-encoded

### Low Quality Results

If results are not relevant:

1. Increase `top_k` to see more options
2. Refine the query with more specific terms
3. Check if document embeddings are up to date
4. Verify the RAG store contains relevant documents

## Best Practices

1. **Use Semantic Queries**: RAG works best with natural language queries, not just keywords
2. **Adjust top_k**: Start with 5-10 results, adjust based on use case
3. **Review Scores**: Higher scores (>0.8) indicate strong relevance
4. **Check Metadata**: Use metadata to filter or categorize results
5. **Combine Results**: Combine multiple search queries for comprehensive coverage
