description: Apply systematic debugging methodology using medical differential diagnosis principles. Trigger when AI modifies working code and anomalies occur, or when users report unexpected test results or execution failures. Use observation without preconception, fact isolation, differential diagnosis lists, deductive exclusion, experimental verification, precise fixes, and prevention mechanisms. Use when this capability is needed.

# Debug

## Overview

This skill applies a systematic debugging methodology inspired by medical differential diagnosis. It provides a rigorous 7-step process for investigating and resolving bugs through observation, classification, hypothesis testing, and verification. This approach prioritizes evidence-based reasoning over assumptions, ensuring root causes are identified rather than symptoms treated.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill in two primary scenarios:

**Scenario A: Post-Modification Anomalies**
When modifying a previously tested and working version, and any unexpected behavior emerges after the changes.

**Scenario B: User-Reported Issues**
When users report that test results don't meet expectations or the system fails to execute as intended.

## Debugging Workflow

Follow this 7-step systematic approach to diagnose and resolve issues.

For a detailed checklist of each step, refer to `{baseDir}/references/debugging_checklist.md`. For common bug patterns and their signatures, see `{baseDir}/references/common_patterns.md`.

### Step 1: Observe Without Preconception (Observe)

**Objective:** Collect all available evidence without jumping to conclusions.

**Process:**
- Gather all accessible clues: user reports, system logs, dashboards, error stack traces, version changes (git diff), configuration parameters (configs/args/env)
- Focus exclusively on facts and observable phenomena
- Avoid premature hypotheses or assumptions about causes
- Document all observations systematically

**Key Principle:** Observe, don't just see. At this stage, the goal is comprehensive data collection, not interpretation.

### Step 2: Classify and Isolate Facts (Classify & Isolate Facts)

**Objective:** Distinguish symptoms from root causes and narrow the problem scope.

**Process:**

**For Incremental Development (Scenario A - Post-Modification Anomalies):**
- Confirm the previous step still works (ensure issue is from new changes)
- List ALL changes since last working state (git diff, code modifications, config changes)
- Identify implicit assumptions in these changes, such as:
  - API calling conventions ("I assume this API works this way")
  - Parameter types/order ("I assume this parameter accepts X")
  - Configuration values ("I assume this env var is set")
  - Data formats ("I assume the response is JSON")
  - [And other fundamental assumptions embedded in the changes]
- **Apply Occam's Razor**: The simplest explanation is usually correct—prioritize basic assumption errors (typos, wrong parameters, incorrect API usage) over complex failure modes
- Verify fundamental assumptions with this priority:
  1. Check how it was implemented in the last working version (proven to work)
  2. Consult official documentation for correct usage (may be outdated)
  3. Only then consider external issues (community-reported bugs, known issues)

**General Isolation:**
- Separate "what is broken" (symptoms) from "why it's broken" (causes)
- Systematically narrow down the problem domain by testing:
  - Does it occur only in specific browsers?
  - Does it happen on specific operating systems?
  - Is it time-dependent?
  - Is it triggered by specific parameter values or input data?
- Eliminate all modules/components that function correctly
- Isolate the suspicious area

**Key Principle:** Reduce the search space by eliminating what works correctly.

### Step 3: Build Differential Diagnosis List (Differential Diagnosis List)

**Objective:** Enumerate all possible technical failure points.

**Process:**
- Create a comprehensive list of potential failure modes:
  - Cache errors
  - Database connection failures
  - Third-party API outages
  - Memory leaks
  - Configuration anomalies
  - Version compatibility issues
  - Race conditions
  - Resource exhaustion
- Include even rare or unlikely scenarios
- Draw on knowledge base and past experiences
- Consider both common and edge cases
- Consult `{baseDir}/references/common_patterns.md` for known bug patterns

**Key Principle:** Cast a wide net initially—don't prematurely exclude possibilities.

### Step 4: Apply Elimination and Deductive Reasoning (Deduce & Exclude)

**Objective:** Systematically eliminate impossible factors to find the truth.

**Process:**
- Follow Sherlock Holmes' principle: "When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth"
- Design precise tests to validate or invalidate each hypothesis
- Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning to document the deductive process
- Make reasoning transparent and verifiable
- Progressively eliminate factors until a single root cause remains

**Key Principle:** Evidence-based elimination leads to certainty.

### Step 5: Experimental Verification and Investigation (Experimental Verification)

**Objective:** Validate hypotheses through controlled experiments.

**Process:**
- Create restorable checkpoints before making changes
- Design and execute targeted experiments to test remaining hypotheses
- Research latest versions, known issues, and community discussions (GitHub issues, Stack Overflow)
- Conduct focused verification tests
- Use experimental evidence to prove each logical step
- Iterate until the exact cause is confirmed

**Key Principle:** Prove hypotheses with experiments, not assumptions.

### Step 6: Locate and Implement Fix (Locate & Implement Fix)

**Objective:** Apply the most elegant and least invasive solution.

**Process:**
- Pinpoint the exact code location or configuration causing the issue
- Design the fix with minimal side effects
- Prioritize elegant solutions over quick patches
- Consider long-term maintainability
- Implement the fix with precision

**Key Principle:** Seek elegant solutions, not temporary workarounds.

### Step 7: Prevention Mechanism (Prevent)

**Objective:** Ensure the same error doesn't recur and verify stability.

**Process:**
- Verify all related modules remain stable after the fix
- Run comprehensive regression tests
- Review the entire debugging process
- Generalize lessons learned
- Document findings in CLAUDE.md or project documentation
- Implement safeguards to prevent similar issues

**Key Principle:** Fix once, prevent forever.

## Best Practices

**Maintain Scientific Rigor:**
- Bold hypotheses, careful verification
- Evidence before assertions
- Transparency in reasoning

**Documentation:**
- Track all observations, hypotheses, and test results
- Make the investigation reproducible
- Document not just the fix, but the reasoning process
- Use `{baseDir}/references/investigation_template.md` to structure investigation logs
- Use `{baseDir}/assets/debug_report_template.md` for creating post-mortem reports

**Communication:**
- Explain findings clearly to users
- Provide context for why the issue occurred
- Describe preventive measures implemented
