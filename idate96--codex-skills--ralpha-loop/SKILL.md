description: Implement-test-review loop for coding tasks with strict iteration until reviewer has zero findings. Use when asked to implement changes, run tests, request review, address findings, retest, and repeat. Optimize for reusing the same reviewer agent across iterations instead of spawning new reviewers each cycle. Use when this capability is needed.

# Ralpha Loop

Execute a deterministic loop:
1. Implement or patch.
2. Run targeted tests/checks.
3. Send the same reviewer agent the updated diff and evidence.
4. Address findings.
5. Retest.
6. Repeat until reviewer reports no findings.

## Loop Contract

- Keep one persistent reviewer agent for the whole task.
- Keep one persistent worker agent only if parallel implementation is needed.
- Reuse agent IDs across iterations; do not respawn unless the agent is dead/unrecoverable.
- Require at least one concrete verification step after every code change.
- Treat reviewer findings as the primary queue; do not add unrelated refactors during the loop.

## Setup

Create and track an in-memory registry at loop start:
- `reviewer_agent_id`
- `worker_agent_id` (optional)
- `iteration` (start at 1)
- `open_findings` (list)
- `resolved_findings` (list)

Spawn reviewer once with scope, files, and review rubric (bugs/regressions/tests). Keep this reviewer alive until completion.

## Iteration Procedure

### 1) Implement

Apply the smallest change set that addresses current scope or findings.

### 2) Verify

Run fast, relevant checks first:
- Linters/compilation/static checks for touched files.
- Focused tests for modified behavior.
- Runtime smoke test when applicable.

If a check cannot run, record why and continue to review with that gap explicit.

### 3) Review (same reviewer)

Send reviewer a delta-focused prompt:
- Current objective.
- Files changed this iteration.
- Verification evidence.
- Previous findings status (fixed/pending).

Ask for severity-ordered findings with file:line and explicit “no findings” when clean.

### 4) Triage

For each finding:
- Confirm reproducibility or code-level validity.
- Mark as `accepted` or `contested` with short rationale.
- Patch all accepted findings before next review round.

### 5) Retest

Re-run affected checks after patches.

### 6) Loop Gate

- If reviewer reports findings: increment iteration and repeat.
- If reviewer reports no findings: exit loop.

## Agent Coordination Quirks

- Prefer `send_input` to the existing reviewer agent over `spawn_agent`.
- Use `interrupt=true` only to redirect stale reviewer work; otherwise queue normally.
- Do not close reviewer agent between rounds; preserve context continuity.
- If reviewer times out, use `wait` with longer timeout before deciding to respawn.
- Respawn reviewer only when agent is closed, unresponsive across retries, or context is corrupted.
- When respawning is unavoidable, send a compact handoff:
  - latest objective
  - current diff summary
  - findings ledger
  - verification results

## Findings Ledger Format

Track each finding as:
- `id`: stable label (e.g., `R1-F2`)
- `severity`
- `location` (`path:line`)
- `summary`
- `status` (`open`, `fixed`, `contested`)
- `evidence` (test/check or reasoning)

Reuse the same IDs when reporting progress to reviewer.

## Completion Criteria

Exit only when all are true:
- Reviewer explicitly reports no findings.
- Latest checks for touched behavior pass (or remaining gaps are documented).
- Final summary includes:
  - what changed
  - what was tested
  - reviewer outcome
  - residual risks/gaps
