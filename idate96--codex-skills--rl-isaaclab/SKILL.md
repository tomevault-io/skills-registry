description: Entry point for Moleworks IsaacLab RL work in `moleworks_ext`. Use when working on local smoke tests, Euler submits, run sync, policy playback, benchmark interpretation, or experiment tracking. Routes to narrower IsaacLab skills for cluster ops and benchmarking. Use when this capability is needed.

# RL + IsaacLab Router

Use this as the default entry point for `moleworks_ext` RL work. Keep it thin and load narrower skills for the specific workflow step you need.

## Repo Root

- Prefer the active `moleworks_ext` checkout the user is already using.
- If you need a default on this machine, start from `/home/lorenzo/moleworks/moleworks_ext`.
- Read repo `AGENTS.md` plus `docs/AI_RESEARCHER_WORKFLOW.md` before changing workflow or commands.

## Always-Loaded Rules

- Any script that touches Isaac Sim or IsaacLab must run via `/workspace/isaaclab/isaaclab.sh -p`.
- Local smoke first, with W&B disabled.
- Real training runs use W&B and should be tracked in the experiment docs.
- Do not recommend checkpoints from sync alone. Require benchmark evidence.
- Prefer repo scripts and checked-in helpers over ad-hoc command reconstruction.
- Do not run long noisy training jobs yourself unless the user explicitly wants live execution and the output is tightly bounded.

## Route To Narrower Skills

- For cluster submit, `squeue`/`sacct`, failed-job debugging, sync, and `docs/EXPERIMENTS_*` hygiene, also use `rl-isaaclab-cluster-ops`.
- For checkpoint benchmarking, policy playback, TensorBoard temporal plots, and run-to-run comparisons, also use `rl-isaaclab-benchmark`.
- If IsaacLab debugging also involves ROS parity stacks, TF, Dig3D replay, or controller-side checks, also use `newton-ros-parity` and `ros2-debugging`.
- If the task needs many code/doc searches, W&B queries, log inspection, or benchmark diffs, also use `moleworks-subagent-orchestrator`.

## Branch References

Read only the docs that match the current task:

- `docs/AI_RESEARCHER_WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/EXPERIMENTS_ONGOING.md`
- `docs/EXPERIMENTS_RUN.md`
- `docs/MULTI_GPU_TRAINING.md`
- `docs/MULTI_GPU_BALANCED_TRAINING.md`

## Default Starting Points

- Train: `scripts/rsl_rl/train.py`
- Play: `scripts/rsl_rl/play.py`
- Cluster submit: `docker/cluster/cluster_interface.sh`
- Cluster sync: `docker/cluster/sync_experiments.sh`
- Live run report: `scripts/utils/cluster_run_report.sh`
- Config diff: `scripts/utils/compare_run_configs.py`
- Excavation benchmark: `scripts/mole_environments/excavation3D/benchmark_excavation.py`
- Temporal plots: `scripts/plot_tb_scalars.py`

If the task starts to sprawl across cluster ops, benchmarks, ROS parity, and repo archaeology at the same time, stop and load the narrower skills rather than expanding this one.
