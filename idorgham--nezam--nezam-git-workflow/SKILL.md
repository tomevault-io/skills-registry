# Purpose

Govern repository hygiene end-to-end: branching model, conventional commits, annotated tags, PR-required checks, branch protection, and dependency automation (Renovate / Dependabot). Single-responsibility: git + GitHub workflow contract. (Absorbs the previously-proposed `nezam-github-workflows`.)

# Inputs

- `docs/specs/VERSIONING.md` for semver policy.
- DevOps pipeline from `@.cursor/skills/nezam-devops-pipeline/SKILL.md`.
- Team conventions and repo defaults.
- Compliance regime affecting retention and audit.

# Step-by-Step Workflow

1. Branching: long-lived `main` (protected); short-lived `feature/<spec-id>-slug`, `release/x.y.z`, `hotfix/x.y.z`.
2. Conventional Commits enforced at message authoring time (manual or commit-msg hook); types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`.
3. Annotated tags `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` only on release-worthy commits listed in changelog.
4. PR checks (required): lint, typecheck, unit, contract, e2e, security (CodeQL), onboarding readiness; surface status to GitHub.
5. Branch protection on `main`: required reviews (≥ 1, code-owners for sensitive paths), required status checks, linear history (no merge commits), dismiss stale approvals on push, require signed commits where supported.
6. Dependency automation: Renovate (preferred) or Dependabot — group minor + patch, separate majors, security alerts auto-PR; weekly cadence.
7. Release path:
   - Run `.nezam/core/scripts/release/version-plan.sh` to confirm semver intent.
   - Use `/DEPLOY tag` to trigger GitHub `release` workflow with `version` (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) and optional `target`/`prerelease`.
   - Workflow creates `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag and GitHub release notes.
8. Optional automation: `git-automation.yml` (workflow_dispatch dispatcher rejecting branch/commit ops), `semantic-release.yml` (workflow_dispatch only) — coordinate to avoid double-tagging.

# Validation & Metrics

- 100% PRs follow Conventional Commits (lint failure blocks merge).
- Required checks gate every merge to `main`.
- Tag history is linear; no force-pushes to `main`.
- Renovate/Dependabot PRs reviewed within 7 days; security alerts within 48h.
- Release notes auto-generated and contain the changelog section.

# Output Format

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (onboarding readiness + required checks).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` (preview + publish).
- `.github/workflows/git-automation.yml` (optional dispatcher).
- `.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml` (optional, semantic-release).
- `release.config.cjs` (when semantic-release used).
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` and `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- `renovate.json` or Dependabot config under `.github/`.
- Branch protection settings exported (markdown checklist).

# Integration Hooks

- `/SAVE branch|commit|tagplan` runs branching + commit hygiene.
- `/DEPLOY tag` triggers the release path.
- `/SCAN security` runs CodeQL + secret scanning.
- Pairs with `@.cursor/skills/nezam-devops-pipeline/SKILL.md`, `@.cursor/skills/nezam-secret-management/SKILL.md`, `@.cursor/skills/nezam-security-hardening/SKILL.md`.
- Honors `[.cursor/rules/workspace-orchestration.mdc](.cursor/rules/workspace-orchestration.mdc)`.

# Anti-Patterns

- Force-push to `main` (or unprotected `main`).
- Skipping Conventional Commits ("misc", "wip").
- Tagging without an annotated message + changelog reference.
- Dependabot PRs ignored for weeks (security debt).
- Required-check list that does not include security and onboarding readiness.
- Double-tagging via parallel automation paths.
