# Cryptographic Action Security Pattern

This pattern encapsulates the common considerations for integrating cryptographic primitives into a system. It acts as a foundation for specific patterns like Encryption, Digital Signature, and Message Authentication Code (MAC).

## Purpose

This pattern does not directly address a specific security problem but provides essential guidance for correctly applying cryptographic solutions. Proper implementation of cryptographic actions is crucial—incorrect usage can nullify all security guarantees.

## Core Components

| Role | Type | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Entity** | Entity | Wants to perform one or more cryptographic actions |
| **Cryptographer** | Cryptographic Primitive | Library that provides cryptographic actions |

### Data Elements

- **input**: The plaintext data on which the cryptographic action is performed
- **output**: The result of the cryptographic action (e.g., ciphertext, digital signature)
- **keyInfo**: Information on the cryptographic key to use (identifier or key material itself, depending on key management approach)
- **config**: Configuration for the Cryptographer (e.g., cipher mode) - optional

## Pattern Flow

```
Entity → [crypto_action(input, keyInfo, config)] → Cryptographer
Cryptographer → [output] → Entity
```

1. Entity requests a cryptographic action (e.g., encrypt, sign)
2. Entity provides input data, key information, and optional configuration
3. Cryptographer performs the requested action
4. Cryptographer returns the result to Entity

## Critical Considerations

### Reuse Existing Libraries

**One should always use existing, well-known libraries when integrating cryptography into a system.**

**Never attempt to:**
- Define new, custom cryptographic ciphers
- Implement existing ciphers yourself
- Create custom cryptographic protocols

Before selecting a library:
- Consult library documentation
- Verify assumptions and dependencies are compatible with your system
- Avoid libraries no longer actively maintained
- Avoid libraries that deviate from best practices

### Use Keys for a Single Purpose

**A cryptographic key should never be used for multiple purposes.**

Examples of violations:
- Using the same key for encryption AND signing
- Using the same key for different types of data

Why this matters:
- May negatively impact security properties of operations
- Increases damage if key is compromised
- Different operations may have different security requirements

### Design for Change

Over time, vulnerabilities in ciphers or implementations will be discovered, and processing power will increase. Software should be designed to allow:
- Configuration changes (e.g., longer keys)
- Cipher replacement
- Library replacement

**Recommended approach**: Provide an API abstraction layer around the cryptography library. This abstraction:
- Isolates cryptographic operations
- Makes transitions easier
- Centralizes cryptographic policy

### Configuration Integrity

If Entity provides configuration to Cryptographer:
- **Protect against tampering** during transmission and storage
- An attacker might change configuration to use insecure, deprecated ciphers
- Detect any unauthorized changes

### Configuration Confidentiality

In some cases, configuration may reveal information about:
- Keys that will be used
- System capabilities
- Attack surface

Consider additional measures to keep configuration confidential when warranted.

## Implementations

This pattern is specialized by:
- **Encryption**: Encrypting and decrypting data
- **Digital Signature**: Signing and verifying messages
- **Message Authentication Code (MAC)**: Generating and verifying MACs

Each implementation provides specific considerations for that cryptographic action.

## Related Patterns

- **Cryptographic key management**: Addresses proper key handling
- **Cryptography as a service**: Delegates crypto to external service (e.g., KMS)
- **Self-managed cryptography**: Application manages its own keys
