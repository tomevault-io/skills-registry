## Activation Contract

Use this skill before creating a commit, opening a PR, or preparing changes for review in Logmancer.

## Hard Rules

- Run `cargo fmt` before any commit or PR preparation.
- Run `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` after formatting.
- Do not create the commit or PR while either command fails.
- If `cargo fmt` changes files, include those formatting changes in the same reviewable work unit.
- Do not run `cargo build`; this project explicitly avoids builds during agent changes unless the user asks.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` before committing any relevant user-facing, release, packaging, workflow, or behavior change.
- Keep Conventional Commit style and never add AI attribution trailers.

## Decision Gates

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `cargo fmt` succeeds with changes | Continue, then include changed files in commit/PR scope |
| `cargo fmt` fails | Stop, report the formatter error, and do not commit or open a PR |
| `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` fails | Fix warnings if in scope; otherwise stop and report blockers |
| Change affects users, releases, packaging, CI behavior, or documented behavior | Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the same work unit before committing |
| Change is purely internal and not notable for release notes | Leave `CHANGELOG.md` unchanged and mention why in the commit/PR summary |
| User asks to skip gates | Push back and require explicit confirmation before bypassing |

## Execution Steps

1. Decide whether the change is changelog-worthy before staging the commit.
2. If it is notable, update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` or the active release section.
3. Run `cargo fmt` from the repository root.
4. Run `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` from the repository root.
5. Inspect the resulting working tree before committing or preparing a PR.
6. Proceed only when the changelog decision is explicit and both commands pass.

## Output Contract

Report:
- `cargo fmt`: pass/fail and whether files changed.
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`: pass/fail.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: updated or intentionally unchanged, with a short reason.
- Any blockers that prevent commit or PR creation.
