# Scrape Content

Scrape tweets (Twitter/X) and save them as markdown files. API keys and implementation details are handled internally by `scripts/lib.ts`.

## Usage

### Single tweet

```bash
bun scripts/scrape-tweet.ts <url> [comment] [--output-dir <dir>]
```

### Batch (from file)

```bash
bun scripts/scrape-batch.ts <input-file> [--output-dir <dir>]
```

Input file format — one URL per entry, optional comment on the next line, separated by `---`:

```
https://x.com/user/status/123
optional user comment
---
https://x.com/user/status/456
---
```

## Output

Default output directory is `./scraped` relative to cwd. Override with `--output-dir`.

Each tweet produces a `{tweetId}.md` file with this structure:

- tweet URL + human-readable date
- tweet text
- user comment (if provided)
- author link + display name
- engagement metrics (likes, retweets, replies, views; quotes/bookmarks only when > 0)
- full raw API response as JSON

On error, the file is still created with error info so nothing is silently lost.

## User Comments

Comments are **critically important context** provided by the user. They appear after the tweet text and before the author info. Never lose them.

## Self-Improvement

This skill is designed to evolve:

- **Add new scripts** in `scripts/` for new scraping sources
- **Update `lib.ts`** to fix bugs, improve output, or add shared utilities
- **Edit this SKILL.md** to document new capabilities
