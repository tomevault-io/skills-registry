# Commit Code Skill

Create well-organized git commits with automatic task ID prefixing. **Default to a single commit.** Only split into multiple commits when changes are genuinely unrelated.

## Workflow

1. **Gather metadata (parallel)** - Run all these commands in a single message with parallel tool calls:
   - `git branch --show-current` - Get current branch for task ID extraction
   - `git log main..HEAD --oneline --max-count=10` - Recent commits for task ID pattern
   - `git status` - List all modified, staged, and untracked files
2. **Extract task ID** - Parse branch name or recent commits for task ID pattern
3. **Inspect changes selectively** - Based on file list from status:
   - For small/focused changes: read diff for specific files with `git diff -- <file>`
   - For config/simple changes: may not need diff at all
   - Avoid running `git diff` without file paths on large changesets
4. **Decide whether to split** - Default is a single commit. Only split if changes are genuinely unrelated (see Grouping Strategy)
5. **Create commit(s)** - Stage and commit, preferring one commit unless splitting is clearly warranted

## Task ID Detection

Check these sources in order:

1. **Branch name patterns**:
   - `feature/AB-123-description` → `AB-123`
   - `AB-123/description` → `AB-123`
   - `fix/AB-123` → `AB-123`
   - Pattern: uppercase letters + hyphen + numbers (e.g., `PROJ-1234`, `AB-1`)

2. **Recent commits on branch** (not yet in main):
   ```bash
   git log main..HEAD --oneline
   ```
   Look for existing task ID prefixes in commit messages.

3. **If no task ID found**: Proceed without prefix, but mention this to the user.

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:

```
<TASK-ID>: <type>(<scope>): <description>

<optional body>
```

- **With task ID**: `AB-123: feat(auth): add login form validation`
- **Without task ID**: `feat(auth): add login form validation`

**Types** (required):
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `style` - Formatting, no code change
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks, dependencies
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `build` - Build system changes

**Scope** (optional): Component or area affected, e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`

## Grouping Strategy

**One commit is the default.** Most changesets belong in a single commit. Do not look for ways to split — only split when you have a clear reason.

### When NOT to split (keep in one commit)

- **Tests and the code they test** - ALWAYS commit tests together with the implementation they cover. Never use the `test` type for tests that accompany a feature or fix — use `feat` or `fix` and include the tests in the same commit.
- A feature and its associated config/type/schema changes
- A refactor that touches multiple files for the same reason
- Tightly coupled changes that would break if separated
- Any single logical change that spans multiple files

### When to split (multiple commits)

Only split when ALL of these are true:
- Changes serve **completely different purposes** (e.g., an unrelated bug fix + a new feature)
- Each commit could be **independently reverted** without breaking the other
- A reviewer would naturally **review them as separate units**

If in doubt, use a single commit.

## Example Workflow

### Typical case: single commit

```bash
# 1. Gather metadata (run these in PARALLEL - single message, multiple tool calls)
git branch --show-current           # → feature/PROJ-123-user-auth
git log main..HEAD --oneline --max-count=10
git status                          # → lists modified files

# 2. Inspect specific files as needed (based on status output)
git diff -- src/auth/service.ts
git diff -- src/auth/service.test.ts

# 3. All changes are part of the same feature → single commit (tests included!)
git add src/auth/service.ts src/auth/service.test.ts src/auth/types.ts
git commit -m "PROJ-123: feat(auth): implement user authentication service"
```

### Rare case: multiple commits (genuinely unrelated changes)

```bash
# Only split when changes are truly independent — e.g., a bug fix AND an unrelated feature
git add src/billing/invoice.ts
git commit -m "PROJ-456: fix(billing): correct tax calculation rounding"

git add src/auth/service.ts src/auth/service.test.ts
git commit -m "PROJ-123: feat(auth): implement user authentication service"
```

## Important Notes

- Always show the user what commits will be created before executing
- Use `git add -p` for partial file staging when needed
- Never force push or amend pushed commits without explicit permission
- Never push the branch unless explicitly asked
- When in doubt, prefer fewer commits over more — a single well-described commit is almost always better than over-split small ones
