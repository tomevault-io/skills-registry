# Verify FireCrawl Crawled Content

This skill verifies that Markdown files scraped by FireCrawl accurately reflect the content of the original web pages.

## When to Use

- User asks to verify crawled/scraped Markdown files
- User wants to check if crawled content matches original web pages
- User mentions checking for errors or missing content in scraped files

## Workflow

1. **Read the Markdown file** specified by the user
2. **Extract metadata** from the YAML frontmatter:
   - `source_url`: The original URL that was scraped
   - `scraped_at`: When the content was scraped
3. **Fetch the original web page** using the `WebFetch` tool with the `source_url`
4. **Compare content** between the Markdown file and the freshly fetched content
5. **Generate verification report**

## File Format Expected

The Markdown files should have this structure:

```markdown
---
source_url: https://example.com/page
scraped_at: 2026-01-09
---

# Page Title

Content...
```

## Comparison Criteria

When comparing, check for:

1. **Title Match**: Does the main heading match?
2. **Key Sections Present**: Are all major sections from the original present in the scraped file?
3. **Important Data Accuracy**: Are dates, names, numbers accurately captured?
4. **Link Integrity**: Are important links preserved?
5. **Content Completeness**: Is there significant missing content?

## Output Format

Return the verification result in this format:

```
File: <file_path>
URL: <source_url>
Status: PASS | FAIL
Comment: <brief explanation of findings>
```

### Status Definitions

- **PASS**: The Markdown file accurately represents the original web page content with no significant discrepancies
- **FAIL**: There are notable differences, missing content, or errors between the Markdown and the original page

## Example Usage

User: "Verify the crawled file at data/aaai-26/bridge-program/bridge-program.md"

Steps:
1. Read `data/aaai-26/bridge-program/bridge-program.md`
2. Extract `source_url` from frontmatter
3. Fetch the original URL using `WebFetch` tool
4. Compare the two versions
5. Output verification report

## Important Notes

- If the original page has been updated since scraping, note this in the comment
- Focus on content accuracy, not formatting differences (minor whitespace/formatting differences are acceptable)
- If the page requires JavaScript rendering, mention this as a potential cause for discrepancies
