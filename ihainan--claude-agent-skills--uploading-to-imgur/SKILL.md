# Uploading to Imgur

Upload images to Imgur and get shareable links with detailed metadata. Supports both anonymous and authenticated uploads.

## Quick start

### Upload a single image

```bash
python scripts/upload.py image.png
```

Returns:
- Public image URL
- Delete link (for removing the image later)
- Image metadata (size, dimensions, type)

### Upload multiple images

```bash
python scripts/upload.py photo1.png photo2.jpg photo3.gif
```

All results are returned as JSON with detailed information for each upload.

## Configuration

### Initial setup

Set your Imgur Client ID as environment variable:

```bash
export IMGUR_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id_here"
```

### Get your Client ID

See [AUTHENTICATION.md](AUTHENTICATION.md) for step-by-step guide to:
1. Register an Imgur application
2. Get your Client ID
3. (Optional) Get Access Token for authenticated uploads

## Upload modes

### Anonymous upload (Client ID)

Default mode. Images are not associated with your account.

```bash
export IMGUR_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
python scripts/upload.py image.png
```

**Pros:**
- Simple setup
- Client ID never expires
- No account management needed

**Cons:**
- Cannot manage images in your account
- Can only delete via delete link

### Authenticated upload (Access Token)

Images are uploaded to your Imgur account.

```bash
export IMGUR_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"
python scripts/upload.py image.png
```

**Pros:**
- Images appear in your Imgur account
- Manage images through Imgur web interface
- Can edit title, description, etc.

**Cons:**
- Token expires after 28 days
- More complex OAuth setup

## Output format

The script returns JSON with complete information:

```json
{
  "total": 2,
  "successful": 2,
  "failed": 0,
  "uploads": [
    {
      "original_path": "photo.png",
      "filename": "photo.png",
      "success": true,
      "upload_type": "anonymous",
      "imgur_data": {
        "id": "abc123",

        "size": 256789,
        "type": "image/png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced usage

### Save results to file

```bash
python scripts/upload.py image.png --output result.json --pretty
```

### Specify authentication

```bash
# Use specific Client ID
python scripts/upload.py image.png --client-id "your_client_id"

# Use Access Token instead
python scripts/upload.py image.png --access-token "your_token"
```

### Supported formats

- PNG (`.png`)
- JPEG (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`)
- GIF (`.gif`)
- BMP (`.bmp`)
- WebP (`.webp`)
- TIFF (`.tiff`)

## Rate limits

Imgur API limits:
- **~1,250 uploads per day**
- **~12,500 API requests per day**

Sufficient for most personal use cases.

## More information

- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common usage patterns
- **Authentication**: See [AUTHENTICATION.md](AUTHENTICATION.md) for detailed setup guide

## Scripts reference

### upload.py

Main upload script.

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/upload.py [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGE ...]
```

**Required:**
- `IMAGE`: One or more image file paths

**Options:**
- `--client-id ID`: Imgur Client ID (or use IMGUR_CLIENT_ID env)
- `--access-token TOKEN`: Access Token for authenticated upload
- `--output FILE`: Save JSON results to file
- `--pretty`: Pretty-print JSON output
- `--help`: Show help message

**Environment variables:**
- `IMGUR_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID for anonymous upload
- `IMGUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Access Token for authenticated upload

**Exit codes:**
- `0`: All uploads succeeded
- `1`: One or more uploads failed

**Examples:**

Basic upload:
```bash
export IMGUR_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
python scripts/upload.py photo.png
```

Multiple images with output:
```bash
python scripts/upload.py img1.png img2.jpg --output results.json --pretty
```

Authenticated upload:
```bash
export IMGUR_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token"
python scripts/upload.py photo.png
```

## Error handling

The script handles common errors gracefully:

- **File not found**: Reports which files don't exist
- **Invalid format**: Checks file extensions before upload
- **Network errors**: Reports connection issues with retry suggestions
- **Authentication errors**: Clear messages about invalid credentials
- **Rate limit exceeded**: Informs when daily limit is reached

Each failed upload includes an `error` field in the JSON output with details.

## Tips

1. **Save delete links**: You'll need them to remove images later
2. **Use environment variables**: More secure than hardcoding credentials
3. **Pretty print for debugging**: Use `--pretty` to inspect results
4. **Batch uploads**: Upload multiple images in one command for efficiency
5. **Check rate limits**: Monitor your daily usage if uploading frequently
