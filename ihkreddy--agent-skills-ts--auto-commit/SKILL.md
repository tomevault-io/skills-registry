# Auto-Commit Skill

## 🎯 Use Case Demo

### Scenario
*Developer Sarah just finished implementing a new seat selection feature. She has 5 files changed but struggles to write a good commit message.*

**Before (Manual):**
```bash
git commit -m "updated stuff"  # 😬 Bad commit message
```

**After (With Skill):**
```bash
# Skill analyzes the diff and suggests:
feat(booking): add passenger seat selection with availability check

- Add SeatSelection model with row and seat properties
- Implement seat availability validation in BookingService
- Add GET /api/seats/{flightId} endpoint
- Update booking flow to include seat assignment
```

### Time Saved: 5-10 minutes per commit × 20 commits/day = 2+ hours/day

## When to Use This Skill

- After making changes, before committing
- When unsure how to describe changes
- To maintain consistent commit message format
- For generating detailed commit bodies

## Commit Message Format

Following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Formatting
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `test` - Adding tests
- `chore` - Maintenance

## Agent Instructions

When user asks to commit or wants a commit message:

1. **Get staged changes**: `git diff --cached`
2. **Analyze the diff** to understand:
   - What files changed
   - What type of change (feature, fix, refactor)
   - The scope (which module/component)
3. **Generate commit message** following conventional commits
4. **Present to user** for approval
5. **Execute commit** if approved

### Example Prompts

User: "Commit my changes"
→ Analyze diff, suggest message, commit

User: "What should my commit message be?"
→ Analyze diff, suggest message only

User: "Commit with message: fix login bug"
→ Use provided message directly

## Demo Script

```bash
# 1. Make some changes
echo "// New feature" >> src/feature.ts

# 2. Stage changes
git add .

# 3. Ask agent: "Generate a commit message for my changes"

# 4. Agent analyzes and suggests:
#    feat(core): add new feature module
#    
#    - Add feature.ts with core functionality
#    - Implement base feature logic

# 5. User approves, agent commits
```
