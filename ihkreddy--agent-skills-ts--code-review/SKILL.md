# Code Review Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Reviewing a pull request
- Preparing code for review
- Looking for code review best practices
- Users mention "code review", "review PR", or "review checklist"

## Code Review Checklist

### 1. Functionality
- [ ] Code does what the ticket/PR description says
- [ ] Edge cases are handled
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] No obvious bugs or logic errors

### 2. Code Quality
- [ ] Code is readable and self-documenting
- [ ] Functions/methods are focused and small
- [ ] No code duplication (DRY principle)
- [ ] Naming is clear and consistent
- [ ] No dead code or commented-out code

### 3. Architecture
- [ ] Changes follow existing patterns
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies added
- [ ] Separation of concerns maintained
- [ ] SOLID principles followed

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests added for new code
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Test names are descriptive

### 5. Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checked

### 6. Performance
- [ ] No obvious performance issues
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] No unnecessary loops or iterations
- [ ] Caching considered where appropriate

### 7. Documentation
- [ ] Public APIs are documented
- [ ] Complex logic has comments
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

## Review Comment Guidelines

### Be Constructive
**Good:** "Consider using a dictionary here for O(1) lookup instead of a list."
**Bad:** "This is slow."

### Explain Why
**Good:** "This could cause a null reference exception if `user` is null. Consider adding a null check."
**Bad:** "Add null check."

### Suggest Solutions
**Good:** "You could simplify this with LINQ: `users.Where(u => u.IsActive).ToList()`"
**Bad:** "Simplify this."

### Use Questions for Preferences
**Good:** "What do you think about extracting this into a separate method?"
**Bad:** "Extract this."

## Review Process

1. **Understand Context**: Read the ticket/PR description first
2. **High-Level Pass**: Review overall structure and approach
3. **Detailed Review**: Line-by-line review for issues
4. **Test Coverage**: Verify tests are adequate
5. **Documentation**: Check for necessary documentation
6. **Approve or Request Changes**: Provide clear feedback

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### C# / .NET
- Follow Microsoft naming conventions
- Use async/await properly
- Dispose IDisposable resources
- Use nullable reference types

### TypeScript / JavaScript
- Avoid `any` type
- Use const/let, not var
- Handle promises properly
- Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Use context managers for resources

## Common Issues to Watch For

| Issue | What to Look For |
|-------|-----------------|
| Memory Leaks | Unsubscribed events, unclosed connections |
| Race Conditions | Shared state in async code |
| N+1 Queries | Database queries in loops |
| Magic Numbers | Unexplained numeric constants |
| Long Methods | Methods > 50 lines |
| Deep Nesting | More than 3 levels of indentation |
