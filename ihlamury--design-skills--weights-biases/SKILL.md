# Weights Biases UI Skills

Opinionated constraints for building Weights Biases-style interfaces with AI agents.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Building light-mode interfaces
- Creating Weights Biases-inspired design systems
- Implementing UIs with Inter font and 4px grid

## Colors

- SHOULD use light backgrounds for primary surfaces
- MUST use `#FFFFFF` as page background (`surface-base`)
- SHOULD limit color palette to 1 distinct colors
- MUST maintain text contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for accessibility

### Semantic Tokens

| Token | HEX | RGB | Usage |
|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| `surface-base` | #FFFFFF | rgb(255,255,255) | Page background |

## Typography

- MUST limit font families to: 
- MUST use `text-balance` for headings and `text-pretty` for body text
- SHOULD use `tabular-nums` for numeric data
- NEVER modify letter-spacing unless explicitly requested

## Spacing

- MUST use 4px grid for spacing
- NEVER use arbitrary spacing values (use design scale)
- SHOULD maintain consistent padding within containers

## Borders

- NEVER use arbitrary border-radius values (use design scale)
- SHOULD use subtle borders (1px) for element separation

## Layout

- MUST design for 1920px base viewport width
- NEVER use `h-screen`, use `h-dvh` for full viewport height
- MUST respect `safe-area-inset` for fixed elements
- SHOULD use `size-*` for square elements instead of `w-*` + `h-*`

### Detected Layout Patterns

- **Main Content**: width: 1673px, height: 1080px

## Components

## Interactive States

### Focus

- MUST use `2px` outline with accent color (`#5E6AD2`)
- MUST use `2px` outline-offset
- NEVER remove focus indicators

### Hover

- Buttons (primary): lighten background by 10%
- Buttons (secondary): use `surface-raised` background
- List items: use `surface-raised` background

### Disabled

- MUST use `opacity: 0.5`
- MUST use `cursor: not-allowed`

## Interaction

- MUST use an `AlertDialog` for destructive or irreversible actions
- SHOULD use structural skeletons for loading states
- MUST show errors next to where the action happens
- NEVER block paste in `input` or `textarea` elements
- MUST add an `aria-label` to icon-only buttons

## Animation

- NEVER add animation unless it is explicitly requested
- MUST animate only compositor props (`transform`, `opacity`)
- NEVER animate layout properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, `padding`)
- SHOULD use `ease-out` on entrance animations
- NEVER exceed `200ms` for interaction feedback
- SHOULD respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Performance

- NEVER animate large `blur()` or `backdrop-filter` surfaces
- NEVER apply `will-change` outside an active animation
- NEVER use `useEffect` for anything that can be expressed as render logic
