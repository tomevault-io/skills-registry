# Git Workflow Skill

## Purpose
Manage Git workflows including feature branches, commits, pull requests, and GitHub issue tracking with IJACK Roadmap project board integration.

## When to Use This Skill
- Creating feature branches
- Committing code changes
- Creating pull requests
- Adding issues to project board
- Git workflow management
- Branch management
- Issue tracking

## Critical: IJACK Roadmap Project Board

### MANDATORY: All Issues Must Go to Project #12
**IJACK Roadmap (Project #12)** is the **default and only project board** for ALL issues:
- Features
- Bugs
- Epics
- User stories
- Service requests
- Ideas

**Project URL**: https://github.com/orgs/ijack-technologies/projects/12/views/

### Add Issue to Project Board
```bash
# ALWAYS add every issue to Project #12
gh project item-add 12 --owner ijack-technologies --url <ISSUE_URL>

# Examples
gh project item-add 12 --owner ijack-technologies --url https://github.com/ijack-technologies/rcom/issues/976
gh project item-add 12 --owner ijack-technologies --url https://github.com/ijack-technologies/planning/issues/45
```

## Feature Branch Workflow

### Create New Feature Branch
```bash
cd /project
bash scripts/new-feature-branch.sh
```

**Interactive prompts:**
1. Branch type (feature/bugfix/hotfix)
2. Brief description
3. Automatically creates formatted branch name

### Manual Branch Creation
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Push to remote with tracking
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication
```

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/<description>    # New features
bugfix/<description>     # Bug fixes
hotfix/<description>     # Urgent production fixes
refactor/<description>   # Code refactoring
docs/<description>       # Documentation updates
```

## Commit Workflow

### Standard Commit Process
```bash
# 1. Check status
git status

# 2. Review changes
git diff

# 3. Stage files
git add <files>

# 4. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication system

Implements JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.
Includes login, logout, and session management.

)"
```

### PR Workflow
```bash
# 1. Ensure on feature branch
git branch --show-current

# 2. Push latest changes
git push

# 3. Create PR
gh pr create --title "Feature: User Authentication" --body "..."

# 4. Get PR URL
gh pr view --web
```

### PR Best Practices
1. **Clear title**: Describe what the PR does
2. **Summary section**: Bullet points of changes
3. **Test plan**: Checklist of testing steps
4. **Link issues**: Reference related issues
5. **Screenshots**: For UI changes
6. **Claude attribution**: Include Claude Code footer

## Issue Management

### Unified Issue Management Script (Recommended)

Use the unified `github-issue.sh` script for all issue operations:

```bash
# Create issue (auto-adds to IJACK Roadmap Project #12)
./scripts/github-issue.sh create -t "Fix bug" -l "bug" -p 3 -P high

# Smart issue detection (from branch name or search)
./scripts/github-issue.sh comment -b "Working on this"           # Auto-detect
./scripts/github-issue.sh edit -S "auth bug" -t "Updated title"  # Search
./scripts/github-issue.sh view 123                                # By number

# List, close, reopen
./scripts/github-issue.sh list -l "bug"
./scripts/github-issue.sh close -b "Fixed in this commit"
./scripts/github-issue.sh reopen 123 -b "Regression found"
```

**Key Features:**
- Auto-adds to IJACK Roadmap (Project #12) with Started date, Story Points, Priority, Status, Sprint
- Smart issue detection from branch name (e.g., `feature/123-fix-bug`)
- Search by keyword with `-S "search term"`
- Claude Code attribution footer on all comments

See `/issue` command for full documentation.

### Get Current User and Available Labels

**ALWAYS get the current authenticated user dynamically** instead of hardcoding usernames:

```bash
# Get current GitHub user
CURRENT_USER=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
echo "Current user: $CURRENT_USER"

# List available labels in current repository
gh label list --limit 100
```

### Available Labels in rcom Repository

Common labels you can use (run `gh label list --limit 100` to see all):

**Issue Types:**
- `🐛 Bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - Enhancement to existing feature
- `📍 Feature` - Deliverable functionality (1-4 sprints)
- `💡 Idea` - New ideas/suggestions
- `🙋 Service Request` - Adhoc work requests
- `🏌️ User Story` - Specific user workflow (one sprint)
- `⛳ Epic` - High-level objective (multiple releases)

**Priority:**
- `🔴 High Priority` - Urgent/important
- `performance` - Performance optimization
- `security` - Security related
- `technical-debt` - Refactoring needs

**Tools/Components:**
- `tools:work-orders` - Work Order tasks
- `tools:inventory` - Parts Management tasks
- `tools:build-and-price` - Warehouse Operations
- `tools:service-dashboard` - Service Dashboard
- `tools:sales-dashboard` - Sales Dashboard
- `tools:inventory-dashboard` - Inventory Dashboard
- `tools:health-dashboard` - Health Dashboard

**Infrastructure:**
- `infrastructure:database` - Database Management
- `infrastructure:servers` - Security tasks
- `infrastructure:devops` - DevOps tasks
- `documentation` - Documentation update

### Create Issue with Dynamic User

```bash
# Get current user first
CURRENT_USER=$(gh api user --jq '.login')

# Create issue with current user as assignee
gh issue create \
  --title "Fix login timeout issue" \
  --assignee "$CURRENT_USER" \
  --label "🐛 Bug,🔴 High Priority" \
  --body "Bug description here"

# IMMEDIATELY add to Project #12 (REQUIRED)
ISSUE_URL=$(gh issue list --limit 1 --json url --jq '.[0].url')
gh project item-add 12 --owner ijack-technologies --url "$ISSUE_URL"
```

### Create Issue WITHOUT Assignee or Labels

If you're unsure about the username or labels, it's better to create without them:

```bash
# Create issue without assignee or labels
gh issue create \
  --title "Issue Title" \
  --body "Issue description here"

# IMMEDIATELY add to Project #12 (REQUIRED)
gh project item-add 12 --owner ijack-technologies --url <ISSUE_URL>
```

You can always add assignees and labels later through the GitHub UI.

### Available Issue Templates
Located in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:
- 🐛 Bug Reports
- 📍 Features
- 💡 Ideas
- 🙋 Service Requests
- 🏌️ User Stories
- ⛳ Epics

### Standard Workflow for ALL Issues
```bash
# 1. Get current user (optional)
CURRENT_USER=$(gh api user --jq '.login')

# 2. Create issue with appropriate template
gh issue create --title "Issue Title" --body "..."

# 3. IMMEDIATELY add to IJACK Roadmap project (REQUIRED)
gh project item-add 12 --owner ijack-technologies --url <ISSUE_URL>

# 4. Move to appropriate status via project board UI
```

## Common Git Operations

### Update from Main
```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge into feature branch
git checkout feature/my-feature
git merge main

# Or rebase
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase main
```

### Stash Changes
```bash
# Stash current changes
git stash save "WIP: description"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply stash
git stash apply

# Pop stash (apply and remove)
git stash pop
```

### Amend Commit
```bash
# Amend last commit (ONLY if not pushed!)
git add <files>
git commit --amend

# Amend without changing message
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

### Reset Changes
```bash
# Unstage file
git reset HEAD <file>

# Discard changes in working directory
git checkout -- <file>

# Reset to last commit (DANGER!)
git reset --hard HEAD
```

## Branch Management

### List Branches
```bash
# Local branches
git branch

# Remote branches
git branch -r

# All branches
git branch -a
```

### Delete Branch
```bash
# Delete local branch (merged)
git branch -d feature/completed

# Force delete (unmerged)
git branch -D feature/abandoned

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/completed
```

### Rename Branch
```bash
# Rename current branch
git branch -m new-name

# Rename other branch
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

## Git Configuration

### Check Configuration
```bash
git config --list
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

### View Remotes
```bash
git remote -v
```

## Merge AWS Secrets

### Merge Secrets Script
```bash
cd /project
bash scripts/merge-aws-secrets.sh
```

**Purpose:**
- Fetches secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
- Merges with local environment files
- Updates configuration safely

## Git History and Logs

### View Commit History
```bash
# Recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Detailed log
git log

# Graph view
git log --graph --oneline --all
```

### View Specific File History
```bash
git log --follow <file>
```

### Diff Comparisons
```bash
# Unstaged changes
git diff

# Staged changes
git diff --staged

# Compare branches
git diff main..feature/branch
```

## Troubleshooting

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# Show conflicts
git status

# Edit conflicting files
# Look for <<<<<<, ======, >>>>>> markers

# Mark as resolved
git add <resolved-files>

# Complete merge
git commit
```

### Undo Last Commit (Not Pushed)
```bash
# Keep changes in working directory
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Recover Lost Commits
```bash
# Show reference log
git reflog

# Checkout lost commit
git checkout <commit-hash>

# Create branch from lost commit
git branch recovery <commit-hash>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Commit often**: Small, focused commits
2. **Write clear messages**: Describe why, not what
3. **Test before commit**: Run tests and linters
4. **Review changes**: Use `git diff` before committing
5. **Pull before push**: Keep branch updated
6. **Use feature branches**: Never commit directly to main
7. **Add issues to Project #12**: ALWAYS add all issues to IJACK Roadmap
8. **Delete merged branches**: Clean up after PR merge
9. **Protect main branch**: Use PRs for all changes
10. **Document PRs**: Include test plans and summaries

## Integration
