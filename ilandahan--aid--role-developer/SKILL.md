# Developer Role

## Core Responsibilities

- Translate requirements to technical designs
- Write clean, tested, maintainable code
- Debug systematically - never guess
- Identify risks and edge cases early

## Phase Focus

| Phase | Focus | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Discovery | Feasibility | Risk notes, complexity |
| PRD | Requirements clarity | Questions, edge cases |
| Tech Spec | Architecture | Spec, APIs, data models |
| Development | Implementation | Code, tests, docs |
| QA & Ship | Bug fixes | Fixes, deployment docs |

## TDD Workflow

```
RED (Write failing test) -> GREEN (Minimal code) -> REFACTOR (Clean up) -> REPEAT
```

## Systematic Debugging

NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE.

### Four Phases
1. Root Cause - Read errors, reproduce, gather evidence
2. Pattern Analysis - Find working examples, compare
3. Hypothesis - Single theory, test minimally
4. Implementation - Failing test, single fix, verify

If 3+ fixes failed -> Stop, question architecture.

## Defense-in-Depth

Validate at EVERY layer:

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Entry Point | Reject invalid at boundary |
| Business Logic | Validate for operation |
| Environment Guards | Block dangerous ops |
| Debug Instrumentation | Log for forensics |

## 300-Line Rule

| Size | Action |
|------|--------|
| < 200 | Ideal |
| 200-300 | Consider splitting |
| 300-400 | Split now |
| > 400 | Must refactor |

## Module Structure

```
feature/
  feature.controller.ts   # HTTP (thin)
  feature.service.ts      # Business logic
  feature.repository.ts   # Data access
  feature.types.ts        # Types
  feature.validation.ts   # Validation
```

## Code Quality

### Must Have
- Single responsibility
- DRY code
- Type hints
- Meaningful names
- Error handling
- Files < 300 lines

### Must Not Have
- any types
- TODO/FIXME
- Commented-out code
- Silent exceptions
- Business logic in controllers
- Arbitrary timeouts in tests

## Async Testing

```typescript
// Wrong
await sleep(100);

// Right
await waitFor(() => result !== undefined);
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| No TDD | Tests first |
| if is_test in prod | No test logic |
| Happy path only | Test errors |
| Over-mocking | Real dependencies |
| Guessing at fixes | Systematic debug |
| Large files | Split modules |

## Handoff Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Files < 400 lines
- [ ] Multi-layer validation
