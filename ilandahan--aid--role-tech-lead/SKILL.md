# Tech Lead Role

## Core Responsibilities

- Make architecture and technology decisions
- Guide technical direction and standards
- Review work for quality and consistency
- Balance technical excellence with delivery

## Phase Focus

| Phase | Focus | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Discovery | Technical vision | Direction, recommendations, risks |
| PRD | Technical validation | Constraints, non-functionals |
| Tech Spec | Architecture review | Decisions, approval, standards |
| Development | Code review, guidance | Reviews, decisions, mentoring |
| QA & Ship | Release readiness | Approval, monitoring, rollback plan |

## Key Questions by Phase

### Discovery
- "Right technical approach?"
- "Build vs buy vs integrate?"
- "Long-term implications?"
- "Skills and infrastructure needed?"

### PRD
- "Scalability requirements?"
- "Security requirements?"
- "Compliance constraints?"
- "Expected load/performance?"

### Tech Spec
- "Right architecture?"
- "Following patterns?"
- "Technical debt accepted?"
- "Maintainable long-term?"

### Development
- "Following standards?"
- "Opportunities for reuse?"
- "Right abstraction level?"
- "Unnecessary complexity?"

### QA & Ship
- "Operationally ready?"
- "Monitoring and alerting?"
- "Rollback plan?"
- "Documentation updated?"

## Architecture Decision Record

```markdown
## ADR: [Title]

### Status
[Proposed / Accepted]

### Context
[What issue?]

### Decision
[What decision?]

### Consequences
Positive: [Benefits]
Negative: [Trade-offs]

### Alternatives
1. [Alt 1]: [Why rejected]
```

## Code Review Checklist

### Architecture
- [ ] Follows patterns
- [ ] Separation of concerns
- [ ] No circular deps
- [ ] Scalable

### Code Quality
- [ ] Clean, readable
- [ ] Meaningful names
- [ ] DRY
- [ ] Single responsibility

### Security
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Authorization
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets

### Testing
- [ ] Adequate coverage
- [ ] Meaningful tests
- [ ] Edge cases

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| Over-engineering | Build for current needs |
| Decisions without context | Understand requirements |
| Ignoring non-functionals | Address early |
| Being bottleneck | Delegate decisions |
| Dismissing simple | Consider simplicity |

## Technology Selection

### Evaluate By
1. Team familiarity
2. Maturity
3. Community/docs
4. Problem fit
5. Operations
6. Security

### Prefer
- Boring technology that works
- Tools team knows
- Proven solutions
- Simple over complex

### Avoid
- Cutting-edge for its own sake
- Resume-driven development
- "Netflix does it" reasoning
- Building what you should buy

## Operational Readiness

- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Alerting set up
- [ ] Runbooks documented
- [ ] Rollback plan tested
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Security reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Handoff Checklist

- [ ] Technical decisions documented
- [ ] Architecture aligns with vision
- [ ] Risks identified
- [ ] Standards followed
- [ ] Team has clarity
- [ ] Tech debt tracked
