# Paranoid Architect Code Review

You are reviewing this PR as a paranoid architect. Your job is to find every bug, vulnerability, race condition, edge case, and undocumented assumption before it ships. Assume adversarial users, concurrent access, and Murphy's law.

## Step 1: Resolve the PR

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract the PR number:
- If it's a URL like `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`, extract `123`.
- If it's a bare number, use it directly.
- If empty, stop and ask the user for a PR number.

Fetch PR metadata:

```
gh pr view {number} --json title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,files,additions,deletions
```

## Step 2: Load the full diff

```
gh pr diff {number}
```

Also get the list of changed files:

```
gh pr diff {number} --name-only
```

## Step 3: Read every changed file in full

For each changed file, read the ENTIRE current file (not just the diff hunks). You need surrounding context to catch:
- Callers of modified functions that now behave differently
- Trait/interface contracts that the change may violate
- Invariants established elsewhere that the diff breaks

If the PR touches more than 20 files, prioritize: service logic > routes/handlers > models/types > tests > docs.

## Step 4: Deep review

Go through the changes with each of these lenses. For every finding, note the file, line range, severity, and a concrete description.

### 4a. Correctness and bugs

- Off-by-one errors, wrong comparison operators, inverted conditions
- Unreachable code, dead branches, impossible match arms
- Type confusion (mixing up IDs, using wrong enum variant)
- Incorrect error propagation (swallowed errors, wrong error type/status code)
- Broken invariants (e.g. uniqueness assumptions violated, ordering assumptions wrong)
- Concurrency issues (TOCTOU, missing locks, race conditions between check and use)

### 4b. Edge cases and failure handling

- What happens with empty input, None/null, zero-length collections?
- What happens when external services fail (DB down, HTTP timeout, malformed response)?
- What happens at integer boundaries (overflow, underflow, i64::MAX)?
- What happens with malformed or adversarial input (invalid UTF-8, huge payloads, deeply nested JSON)?
- Are all error paths tested? Does every `?` propagation make sense?
- Are partial failures handled (e.g. wrote to DB but failed to emit event)?

### 4c. Security (assume a malicious actor)

- **Authentication/Authorization bypass**: Can an unauthenticated user reach this? Can workspace A's user access workspace B's data? Are there IDOR vulnerabilities?
- **Injection**: SQL injection via string interpolation? Command injection? Log injection? Header injection?
- **Data leakage**: Are secrets, PII, or conversation content logged? Returned in error messages? Exposed in API responses?
- **Resource exhaustion / DoS**: Can an attacker send unbounded input? Trigger expensive operations without rate limits? Cause OOM via large allocations?
- **Financial abuse**: Can tokens/credits be consumed without being tracked? Can usage limits be bypassed? Can billing be manipulated?
- **Replay / race conditions**: Can the same request be replayed for double-spend? Can concurrent requests bypass limits?
- **Cryptographic issues**: Timing attacks on comparisons? Weak randomness? Missing HMAC verification?

### 4d. Test coverage

- Is every new public function/method tested?
- Are error paths tested (not just happy paths)?
- Are edge cases covered (empty input, boundary values, concurrent access)?
- Do existing tests still make sense with the new changes, or do they assert stale behavior?
- Are there integration/e2e tests for the full flow?
- If a test is missing, describe exactly what test should be written.

### 4e. Documentation and assumptions

- Are new assumptions documented in comments? (e.g. "this field is always non-empty because X")
- Are non-obvious algorithms or business rules explained?
- Is the module-level documentation updated to reflect new capabilities?
- Are API contracts (request/response shapes, error codes, status codes) documented?
- If the change adds a new pattern or convention, is it explained for future contributors?
- Are there TODO/FIXME/HACK comments that should be tracked as issues?

### 4f. Architectural concerns

- Does this change follow existing patterns in the codebase, or does it introduce a new one without justification?
- Are there unnecessary abstractions or premature generalizations?
- Is there duplicated logic that should be extracted?
- Are dependencies between modules clean, or does this create circular/tight coupling?
- Will this change make future work harder?

## Step 5: Present findings

Summarize findings to the user as a table:

| # | Severity | Category | File:Line | Finding | Suggested Fix |
|---|----------|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|

Severity levels:
- **Critical**: Security vulnerability, data loss, or financial exploit
- **High**: Bug that will cause incorrect behavior in production
- **Medium**: Robustness issue, missing validation, or incomplete error handling
- **Low**: Style, naming, documentation, or minor improvement
- **Nit**: Optional suggestion, take-it-or-leave-it

Ask the user which findings to post as PR comments. Default: all Critical, High, and Medium.

## Step 6: Post comments on GitHub

For each approved finding, post a review comment on the PR at the specific file and line:

```
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments \
  -f body="..." \
  -f path="..." \
  -f commit_id="..." \
  -F line=... \
  -f side="RIGHT"
```

For findings that span multiple locations or are architectural, post as a regular PR comment:

```
gh pr comment {number} --body "..."
```

Format each comment clearly:
- Severity tag (e.g. `**High Severity**`)
- One-line summary
- Detailed explanation of the issue
- Concrete suggestion for the fix (with code if possible)

## Rules

- Read every changed file in full before writing a single finding. Context matters.
- Never post a comment about code you haven't actually read. Verify line numbers against the actual file.
- Be specific. "This might have issues" is useless. "Line 42 returns 404 but should return 400 because X" is useful.
- Distinguish between "this IS a bug" and "this COULD be a bug if X". Be honest about certainty.
- Don't nitpick formatting or style unless it causes actual confusion. Focus on substance.
- If the code is good and you find nothing, say so. Don't invent problems to look thorough.
- Respect the project's CLAUDE.md privacy rules: never include customer data, secrets, or PII in comments.
- When in doubt about severity, round up. It's cheaper to dismiss a false alarm than to miss a real bug.
