# Rust Systems & Services

Covers modern application-layer Rust (edition 2024): CLIs, web services, libraries. Not `no_std`/embedded.

## Tooling

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cargo` | Build, dep management, script runner |
| `clippy` | Lint (`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`) |
| `rustfmt` | Formatter (`cargo fmt --all`) |
| `cargo-nextest` | Test runner, noticeably faster than `cargo test`, better isolation |
| `cargo-deny` | License + advisory + duplicate-dep checks |
| `cargo-machete` | Find unused dependencies |

- Pin `rust-toolchain.toml` per repo so every contributor and CI uses the same compiler.
- `cargo update -p <crate>` for single-package upgrades. `cargo update` rewrites everything — avoid in PR diffs.
- `Cargo.lock` goes in version control for binaries *and* libraries (modern guidance; reproducibility wins).

## Workspaces

Multi-crate projects use a workspace with layered crates. Dependencies point inward only.

```
Cargo.toml                  # [workspace] members + [workspace.dependencies]
crates/
  protocol/    # Shared types, no deps on other workspace crates
  storage/     # Persistence, depends on protocol
  service/    # Business logic, depends on protocol + storage
  cli/        # Binary, depends on everything
```

- Centralize versions in `[workspace.dependencies]`, reference as `foo = { workspace = true }` in members.
- Keep the leaf-most crate (`protocol` / types) dependency-free so every other crate can depend on it without cycles.
- Feature flags belong on the crate that introduces the dependency, not re-exported through the workspace root.
- **Library crates expose one stable facade**: a thin `lib.rs` with a `//!` module doc comment stating purpose, followed by `pub use` re-exports of the public surface. Consumers learn one import path per concept; internal module layout can be reorganized without breaking callers.
- **Feature gates must error, never silently degrade.** If runtime config requests a capability the binary wasn't compiled with (e.g. `device = "gpu"` on a non-CUDA build), fail at startup with a clear error. Silent fallback produces different behavior from what the operator configured, often without anyone noticing.
- **Centralize lints at the workspace root** with `[workspace.lints.*]`. Every member crate inherits the same ruleset — no drift between crates, no per-crate `#![deny(...)]` stacks. Example:

  ```toml
  [workspace.lints.rust]
  unsafe_code = "warn"
  missing_docs = "warn"

  [workspace.lints.clippy]
  all = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
  pedantic = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
  nursery = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
  module_name_repetitions = "allow"
  must_use_candidate = "allow"
  ```

  Each member crate opts in with `[lints] workspace = true` in its own `Cargo.toml`. Changing a lint in one place updates every crate.

## Build Profiles

When tuning Cargo build profiles (release LTO, release-dbg symbols, release-min for distributable binaries) or adding dev-machine speedups (mold linker, `target-cpu=native`, share-generics), load [build-profiles.md](./references/build-profiles.md).

## Error Handling

Split by crate role:

- **Libraries / lower crates**: define typed errors with `thiserror`. Consumers can pattern-match.
- **Binaries / top-level crates**: use `anyhow::Result` with `.context("what was being attempted")`. Human-readable error chains.
- Never return `Box<dyn Error>` from library APIs — it erases variant information.
- Use `?` liberally. Never `.unwrap()` or `.expect()` outside tests and `main`. An `expect("...")` is acceptable only when the invariant is provably upheld and the message explains why.
- Convert at boundaries: `#[from]` on thiserror variants for auto-conversion; `.map_err(MyError::from)` when explicit.
- `bail!("...")` / `ensure!(cond, "...")` in application code for early exits.
- Prefer `Result<T, E>` over panics for any recoverable error. Panics are for programmer bugs (broken invariants), not runtime failures.
- **`#[must_use]` on fallible APIs**: annotate functions returning `Result` or newtype-wrapped results that callers frequently ignore. Catches `let _ = validate(x);` at compile time instead of shipping a silently-dropped error.
- **Make illegal call-sequences unrepresentable** rather than returning a runtime error — the type-state pattern. When an API has a mandatory call order (configure → connect → use), encode each stage as a distinct type (`Client<Uninitialized>` → `Client<Initialized>` → `Client<Connected>`) carrying `PhantomData<State>`; a method only exists on the state that permits it. Calling `send_request` before `connect` then fails to compile instead of panicking at runtime — there is no error variant to handle because the bad sequence cannot be written.

## Ownership Discipline

- Take `&str` over `&String`, `&[T]` over `&Vec<T>` in function signatures — accepts more call sites for free.
- Return owned (`String`, `Vec<T>`) from constructors and public APIs. Borrow in hot paths where lifetimes are obvious.
- Reach for `Arc<T>` only when sharing across threads. Single-threaded sharing uses `Rc<T>` or references.
- `Cow<'_, str>` when a function sometimes allocates and sometimes borrows (e.g. normalization).
- Lifetime elision handles 90% of cases. If you're writing `'a` in more than one signature, reconsider whether that type should own its data instead.
- **`bytes::Bytes` for zero-copy slicing** of shared immutable buffers — network parsers, frame decoders, protocol handlers. `BytesMut` for building buffers that `split_to` / `split_off` into `Bytes` without reallocation. Prefer `Bytes` over `Arc<Vec<u8>>` when slicing is the dominant access pattern.
- **Reduce hot-path heap allocations** with stack-or-inline collections when the typical size is small and known:
  - `smallvec::SmallVec<[T; N]>` — inline for ≤N items, spills to heap beyond. Good for "usually 1-8 items" cases like parsed tag lists, lookup keys, small event batches.
  - `arrayvec::ArrayVec<T, CAP>` — fixed capacity, never heap-allocates. Returns an error when full. Good for bounded message buffers or per-request scratch space.
  - String interning for repeatedly-seen strings (enum-like values parsed from config, tenant IDs, route keys): `dashmap::DashMap<String, &'static str>` with `Box::leak` on miss gives `&'static str` comparisons without per-call allocations.
  
  These are optimizations — profile first. `Vec`/`String` on a cold path isn't the bottleneck.

## Async with Tokio

- Default runtime: `#[tokio::main]` with `features = ["full"]` for apps; `features = ["rt", "macros", "sync"]` for libraries that need to stay slim.
- `tokio::spawn` for independent tasks. `JoinSet` for a dynamic group you'll await together with cancellation.
- `tokio::select!` for racing futures (timeouts, cancellation, first-wins).
- Never block the runtime: `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for sync CPU work or blocking I/O libs.
- `tokio::sync::Mutex` only when the guard must be held across `.await`. Otherwise `std::sync::Mutex` is faster.
- **`tokio::sync::RwLock` when reads dominate writes** (config snapshots, route tables, hot caches). Many readers proceed in parallel; `Mutex` serializes them. For snapshot-swap semantics (rarely-updated config), `arc-swap::ArcSwap` is faster still — no lock on the read path.
- Cancellation: `CancellationToken` (from `tokio-util`) propagates shutdown. Long-running tasks must check it.
- Backpressure via bounded `mpsc` channels — unbounded channels hide memory growth until OOM.
- **`Semaphore` for hard concurrency limits** on spawn paths that don't fit a channel model (e.g. "at most 50 concurrent outbound HTTP calls"). `let _permit = sem.acquire().await?;` inside the task; dropping the permit releases the slot. Pair with `Arc<Semaphore>` shared across spawners.
- Don't mix async runtimes. Pick `tokio` and stick with it; `async-std` and `smol` don't interop cleanly.
- **Vectored writes** (`write_vectored` + `std::io::IoSlice`) coalesce many buffers — interleaved headers and payloads — into a single syscall when flushing a batch of messages to a socket; the kernel does the gather. An optimization for measured syscall-bound flush paths — profile first; a single `write_all` is fine elsewhere.

## CLI Tools (clap)

- Use the derive API: `#[derive(Parser)]` + `#[derive(Subcommand)]`. Less boilerplate, types drive the help text.
- One `enum Commands` variant per subcommand; flatten shared flags into a `#[command(flatten)] struct CommonArgs`.
- `--json` flag on query commands for agent/pipe consumption. Emit via `serde_json::to_string(&value)?`.
- Exit codes: 0 success, 1 for errors `main` returned, 2 for argparse (clap handles this), reserve 3+ for domain meanings documented in `--help`.
- Provide `--version` automatically via `#[command(version)]`.

See [cli-tools.md](./references/cli-tools.md) for config layering, logging setup, progress reporting, and shell completions.

## HTTP Services (axum)

- Framework default: **axum** (tokio-native, tower middleware, extractor-based handlers). Pick `actix-web` only if an existing codebase uses it.
- Handlers return `Result<impl IntoResponse, AppError>`. Implement `IntoResponse` for `AppError` to centralize error → status mapping.
- Validate input at the boundary: `axum::extract::Json<T>` where `T: Deserialize + Validate` (use `validator` crate). Internal services trust input was validated.
- Share state via `State<Arc<AppState>>` — not globals, not `lazy_static`.
- Middleware via `tower::ServiceBuilder`: tracing → timeout → auth → CORS → handler. Order matters.
- **Resilience layer stack** (outbound HTTP clients and shared services): `ServiceBuilder::new().layer(TimeoutLayer).layer(RateLimitLayer).layer(ConcurrencyLimitLayer).layer(LoadShedLayer).layer(RetryLayer).service(client)`. Name each layer explicitly — `LoadShedLayer` sheds excess load, `ConcurrencyLimitLayer` caps in-flight requests, `RateLimitLayer` bounds request rate, `RetryLayer` retries classified transient errors. Combining `LoadShedLayer` + `ConcurrencyLimitLayer` produces proper backpressure instead of unbounded queueing.

See [axum-service.md](./references/axum-service.md) for project layout, extractors, error types, graceful shutdown, and OpenAPI generation.

## Concurrency

| Workload | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Independent async I/O | `tokio::spawn` + `JoinSet` or `futures::join!` |
| Data-parallel CPU work | `rayon` with `par_iter` |
| Shared mutable state across threads | `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or `Arc<RwLock<T>>`, smallest scope possible |
| Single-producer pipelines | `tokio::sync::mpsc` (async) or `std::sync::mpsc` (sync) |
| Broadcast / fan-out | `tokio::sync::broadcast` |

`rayon` and `tokio` coexist — use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` to call a rayon pool from async code. Never call `.block_on()` from inside a tokio task; it deadlocks the runtime.

## Testing

- Built-in `#[test]`. Prefer `cargo nextest run --workspace` over `cargo test` — it runs tests in parallel processes with proper isolation.
- Unit tests live in `mod tests { ... }` at the bottom of the file (access to private items).
- Integration tests in `tests/` directory. One file per public surface area.
- `#[tokio::test]` for async tests. Add `flavor = "multi_thread"` when the code under test spawns tasks.
- `rstest` for parametrized tests and fixtures. `proptest` / `quickcheck` for property-based tests on pure logic.
- `insta` for snapshot testing CLI output, serialization, large structs. Review diffs with `cargo insta review`.
- `assert_cmd` + `predicates` for CLI integration tests (invokes the binary, asserts on stdout/stderr/exit code).
- **Assert on error variants with `matches!`**: `assert!(matches!(result.unwrap_err(), MyError::Validation(_)))`. Cleaner than `match` arms when the test only cares whether the error is the right kind, and doesn't force updates when unrelated variants are added.
- Coverage: `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --html`. Target 70%+ on application code, higher on library crates.
- **Fuzzing for parsers**: `cargo fuzz` + `libfuzzer-sys` on any code that parses untrusted input (file formats, protocols, query languages). A short nightly fuzz run surfaces the panics and UB that unit tests miss.

For generic test discipline (anti-patterns, mock rules, rationalization resistance), see the `ia-writing-tests` skill.

## Unsafe Discipline

- Default: no `unsafe`. If clippy flags it, don't `#[allow]` it — refactor.
- Every `unsafe` block gets a `// SAFETY:` comment above it explaining why each invariant holds. No comment = reviewer rejects.
- Keep `unsafe` blocks minimal — wrap in a safe abstraction at module boundary, mark the module `pub(crate)`.
- Use `miri` (`cargo +nightly miri test`) on any crate containing `unsafe` or raw pointer arithmetic — catches UB that optimizers mask.
- Prefer `bytemuck`, `zerocopy`, `bytes` over hand-rolled transmutes for zero-copy patterns.
- **`std::env::set_var` and `remove_var` are `unsafe` under edition 2024.** Concurrent `getenv` from another thread is UB at the libc level; the unsafety can't be wrapped away by `OnceLock::call_once` or `std::sync::Once` — they ensure the closure runs once, not that it runs while no other thread is reading the environment. Pin every env-var write to single-threaded startup, before `tokio::main` or any `std::thread::spawn`. Common offender: native-library discovery paths (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `ORT_DYLIB_PATH`, `LIBTORCH`, plugin loader paths) set lazily on first use — compute and set them in `main` (or a `static` initializer that runs before the runtime) so they're written before any concurrent reader exists.

## Production Resilience

When productionizing a service (config validation, `/health` + `/ready` endpoints, graceful shutdown, retries/timeouts/jitter, connection pools, diagnostic secret redaction), load [production-resilience.md](./references/production-resilience.md).

## Observability

For logging (`tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` with init recipe), `#[instrument]` spans, correlation IDs, metrics, and distributed tracing patterns, load [observability.md](./references/observability.md). Never use `println!` or `log::` in new code.

## CI

General CI design lives with the `ia-infrastructure-engineer` agent. For Rust-specific callouts (`rustsec/audit-check`, `cargo-llvm-cov`, `Swatinem/rust-cache`, `taiki-e/install-action`, matrix coverage guidance, doc-test step), load [ci-pipeline.md](./references/ci-pipeline.md).

## Discipline

- Simplicity first — every change as simple as possible, impact minimal code.
- Only touch what's necessary — avoid unrelated changes in a PR.
- No `#[allow(clippy::...)]` as a shortcut — fix the underlying issue. Document exceptions with a rationale.
- Before adding a trait or generic, verify it's used in 3+ places. Otherwise a concrete type is clearer.
- Verify: see Verify section — pass all checks with zero warnings before declaring done.

## Verify

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` passes with zero diffs
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` passes
- `cargo nextest run --workspace` (or `cargo test --workspace`) passes with zero failures
- `cargo deny check` passes (licenses, advisories, duplicates) for any crate going to production
- No new `unsafe` without `// SAFETY:` comment
