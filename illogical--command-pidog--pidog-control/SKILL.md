# PiDog Control Skill

Control a SunFounder PiDog robotic dog using natural language. This skill bridges voice/text commands to the full Command PiDog REST API running on a Raspberry Pi.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when a user asks to:
- Make PiDog **move** (walk, turn, sit, stand, lie down)
- Perform **actions or tricks** (bark, high five, push-ups, howl, stretch)
- Show **emotions** (excitement, sadness, thinking, surprise)
- **See or describe** what the camera sees (visual Q&A)
- Read **sensor data** (distance, tilt, touch, sound direction, battery)
- Control **LEDs** (change color, animation style)
- Play **sounds** or react to voice
- **Navigate** autonomously (avoid obstacles, turn toward sounds)
- **Interact socially** (handshake, lick hand, wag tail on being petted)

## Prerequisites

- PiDog API running: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
- Base URL: `http://<pi-hostname>:8000/api/v1`
- For vision: camera must be started (`POST /camera/start`) and a vision-capable model configured
- For voice: Whisper STT endpoint running
- Environment variables (in `api/.env`):
  ```
  PIDOG_OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
  PIDOG_OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b
  PIDOG_OLLAMA_VISION_MODEL=llava:7b
  PIDOG_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
  PIDOG_OPENROUTER_VISION_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct
  PIDOG_CAMERA_ENABLED=true
  ```

## Step-by-Step Workflows

### 1. Execute a Named Action

```http
POST /api/v1/actions/execute
Content-Type: application/json

{"actions": ["sit", "handshake"], "speed": 80}
```

**All 30 actions** (speed 0–100):

| Category | Actions |
|---|---|
| Movement | `forward`, `backward`, `turn left`, `turn right`, `stop` |
| Postures | `stand`, `sit`, `lie` |
| Expressions | `bark`, `bark harder`, `pant`, `howling`, `wag tail`, `shake head`, `nod`, `think`, `recall`, `fluster`, `surprise` |
| Social | `handshake`, `high five`, `lick hand`, `scratch` |
| Physical | `stretch`, `push up`, `twist body`, `relax neck` |
| Idle | `doze off`, `waiting`, `feet shake` |

**Posture dependencies** (handled automatically):
- `doze off` requires lying first → send `["lie", "doze off"]`
- `handshake`, `high five`, `lick hand`, `scratch`, `nod`, `relax neck`, `feet shake` → need sitting
- `push up`, `twist body`, `forward`, `backward`, `turn left`, `turn right` → need standing

### 2. Read Sensor Data

```http
GET /api/v1/sensors/all
```
Returns: `distance` (cm), `imu` (pitch/roll °), `touch` (N/L/R/LS/RS), `sound` (direction °, detected bool)

Individual endpoints: `/sensors/distance`, `/sensors/imu`, `/sensors/touch`, `/sensors/sound`

**Touch sensor states:**
- `N` — no touch
- `R` — front touched (PiDog likes this → wag tail, pant)
- `L` — rear touched
- `RS` — slide front→rear (PiDog loves this → ecstatic reaction)
- `LS` — slide rear→front (PiDog dislikes → shake head, back away)

### 3. Visual Perception (Camera Q&A)

Start the camera first (idempotent):
```http
POST /api/v1/camera/start
```

Then ask a vision question:
```http
POST /api/v1/agent/vision
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question": "Who is in front of me? Are they waving?",
  "provider": "openrouter",
  "model": "meta-llama/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct"
}
```

Returns: `description`, `answer`, `actions[]`

The vision endpoint:
1. Captures a JPEG snapshot from the 5MP camera nose
2. Base64-encodes and sends it to the vision LLM with current sensor context
3. Returns a natural language description and suggested PiDog reactions
4. Automatically executes any valid actions in the response

**Vision use cases:**
- Person recognition and greeting
- Obstacle detection and avoidance planning
- Object/toy identification
- Scene narration ("what room am I in?")
- Safety checks ("is the floor clear ahead?")

### 4. AI Chat (Natural Language → Actions)

```http
POST /api/v1/agent/chat
Content-Type: application/json

{"message": "Do a trick to impress me!", "provider": "ollama"}
```

The LLM receives the PiDog skill document + live sensor context and responds with a JSON action plan that is automatically executed.

### 5. Control RGB LEDs

```http
POST /api/v1/rgb/mode
Content-Type: application/json

{"style": "breath", "color": "cyan", "bps": 1.0, "brightness": 0.8}
```

| Style | Effect |
|---|---|
| `monochromatic` | Solid color |
| `breath` | Slowly pulses in and out |
| `boom` | Explodes from center outward |
| `bark` | Radiates from center (alarm) |
| `speak` | Oscillates center↔edges (talking) |
| `listen` | Sweeps left→right (listening) |

Colors: `white`, `black`, `red`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `cyan`, `magenta`, `pink`, or hex `#rrggbb`

### 6. Servo Fine Control

```http
POST /api/v1/servos/head
{"yaw": 45, "roll": 0, "pitch": -20, "speed": 60}
```

Ranges: yaw ±90°, roll ±70°, pitch -45° to +30°

```http
POST /api/v1/servos/tail
{"angle": 60, "speed": 50}
```

Tail range: ±90°

### 7. Play Sounds

```http
GET  /api/v1/sound/list           # List all available sounds
POST /api/v1/sound/play
{"name": "single_bark_1", "volume": 80}
```

### 8. WebSocket Real-Time Streaming

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://<pi-hostname>:8000/api/v1/ws");
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  "type": "subscribe",
  "channels": ["sensors", "action_status", "status", "logs"]
}));
```

| Channel | Rate | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `sensors` | 5 Hz | distance, IMU, touch, sound |
| `status` | 0.2 Hz | battery, posture, uptime |
| `action_status` | on change | current action queue state |
| `logs` | as emitted | server log stream |

## Clever Use Cases

### Obstacle Avoidance Guardian
Poll `GET /sensors/distance` in a loop. When distance < 20 cm:
1. `POST /actions/execute` → `["stop", "backward"]`
2. `POST /rgb/mode` → `{"style": "bark", "color": "red", "bps": 3}`
3. Speak: "Warning! Obstacle detected at {distance} cm!"

### Sound-Guided Head Tracking
Poll `GET /sensors/sound`. When sound detected:
- `POST /servos/head` with yaw set to `(direction - 180) / 2` to face sound source
- Follow up with `bark` if direction persists

### Pickup Detection
Poll `GET /sensors/imu`. When pitch or roll exceeds ±30°:
- PiDog is being picked up — `["surprise"]` action + yellow boom LEDs
- Announce: "Hey! I am not a toy... well, technically I am."

### Petting Response Loop
Poll `GET /sensors/touch` and react in real time:
- `R` or `RS` → `["wag tail", "pant"]` + pink breath LEDs
- `LS` → `["shake head", "backward"]` + red monochromatic
- `L` → `["scratch"]`

### Room Security Patrol
1. `POST /camera/start`
2. Walk a square pattern (`forward` × N, `turn right` × 4)
3. At each corner: `POST /agent/vision` with question "Is anyone here who shouldn't be?"
4. React to the vision response (alert, greet, or continue)

### Performance / Show-Off Sequence
Chain actions for a full crowd-pleasing routine:
```json
{"actions": ["stand", "stretch", "sit", "handshake"]}
```
Then follow with: high five → push up → howling → wag tail

### Emotional Mirror
Read sensor state and pick an emotion:
- Low battery → `doze off` + magenta breath
- Obstacle < 30 cm → `surprise` + red boom
- Touch detected → `pant` + pink breath
- Idle > 60s → `waiting` → random one of `[scratch, relax neck, feet shake]`

### Vision Narration (Livestream Companion)
Start the MJPEG stream at `/camera/stream` and every 30 seconds call `/agent/vision` with:
"Briefly describe this scene in one sentence, then suggest a fun PiDog reaction."
Use the answer as a caption overlay or TTS narration.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| 503 on `/agent/vision` | Start camera first: `POST /camera/start` |
| 502 on `/agent/vision` | Vision model not running — use `provider=openrouter` or run `ollama pull llava:7b` |
| 422 on action execute | Invalid action name — check `/actions` for valid list |
| 422 "battery low" | Battery below 6.5V — charge before heavy movement |
| 429 rate limit | Max 10 actions/second — add delays between rapid commands |
| Actions not chaining | Include posture setup in same request: `["sit", "handshake"]` |
| WebSocket disconnects | Reconnect and re-send subscribe message |
