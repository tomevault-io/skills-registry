# Skill Writer - Create Agent Skills

This skill helps you create well-structured Agent Skills for GitHub Copilot, VS Code, Copilot CLI, and the Copilot coding agent.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating a new Agent Skill from scratch
- Converting existing documentation or workflows into a skill
- Improving or refactoring an existing skill
- Understanding the Agent Skills standard

## Security Requirements (CRITICAL)

> ⚠️ **NEVER include secrets, tokens, API keys, passwords, or any sensitive credentials in skills.**

Skills are stored in git repositories and may be shared publicly. Treat all skill content as public information.

**Prohibited content:**
- API keys or tokens (GitHub, Azure, AWS, etc.)
- Passwords or credentials
- Connection strings with embedded secrets
- Private URLs with authentication tokens
- Personal access tokens (PATs)
- Service account credentials

**Safe alternatives:**
- Reference environment variables: `Use $GITHUB_TOKEN from your environment`
- Use placeholder syntax: `<YOUR_API_KEY>` or `${API_KEY}`
- Document where to securely store credentials (e.g., `.env` files, secret managers)
- Use MCP servers for secure API integrations

## Skill Directory Structure

Each skill should follow this structure:

```
.github/skills/
└── your-skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md           # Required: Main skill definition
    ├── scripts/           # Optional: Helper scripts
    │   └── example.sh
    ├── examples/          # Optional: Example files
    │   └── sample.md
    └── templates/         # Optional: Templates for output
        └── template.md
```

### Where to Create Skills

| Scope | Location | Use When |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Personal (global)** | `~/.copilot/skills/` | Skills you want available across ALL projects |
| **Project-specific** | `.github/skills/` | Skills specific to one repository |

> **Important**: Personal skills at `~/.copilot/skills/` are version controlled in a git repository. After creating or modifying any skill, always commit and push changes to keep them backed up and synced.

Legacy locations (for backward compatibility):
- `.claude/skills/` (project)
- `~/.claude/skills/` (personal)

## SKILL.md File Format

### 1. YAML Frontmatter (Required)

Every `SKILL.md` must start with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: your-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---
```

#### Frontmatter Rules:

| Field | Required | Rules |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase, hyphens for spaces, max 64 characters |
| `description` | Yes | What it does AND when to use it, max 1024 characters |

**Good name examples:**
- `webapp-testing`
- `api-documentation`
- `database-migration`

**Bad name examples:**
- `WebApp Testing` (no uppercase or spaces)
- `my_skill` (use hyphens, not underscores)
- `test` (too vague)

### 2. Skill Body (Instructions)

After the frontmatter, write clear markdown instructions covering:

1. **Purpose** - What this skill accomplishes
2. **When to Use** - Specific triggers and use cases
3. **Step-by-Step Procedures** - Detailed workflows
4. **Examples** - Input/output samples
5. **Resource References** - Links to included files

## Writing Effective Instructions

### Be Specific and Actionable

❌ **Bad**: "Help with testing"

✅ **Good**: "When the user asks to create tests for a React component, generate Jest test files that cover: rendering, user interactions, edge cases, and accessibility."

### Use Clear Section Headers

```markdown
## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Jest installed

## Step-by-Step Process
1. Analyze the component props
2. Create test file with naming convention: `ComponentName.test.tsx`
3. Write test cases for each prop variation
```

### Include Examples

```markdown
## Example

**User Request**: "Create tests for the Button component"

**Expected Output**:
- File: `Button.test.tsx`
- Coverage: onClick handler, disabled state, loading state
```

### Reference Resources with Relative Paths

```markdown
See the [test template](./templates/test-template.js) for the base structure.
Run the [setup script](./scripts/setup.sh) before testing.
```

## Description Writing Guidelines

The `description` field is critical - it determines when Copilot loads your skill.

### Include Both WHAT and WHEN

```yaml
description: Generates comprehensive API documentation from TypeScript interfaces. Use when documenting REST APIs, creating OpenAPI specs, or generating client SDK documentation.
```

### Be Keyword-Rich

Include terms users might say:
- Action verbs: "create", "generate", "debug", "test", "deploy"
- Domain terms: "React", "database", "CI/CD", "authentication"
- Task types: "migration", "refactoring", "optimization"

## Skill Template

Use this template to create new skills:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: [What it does]. Use when [specific scenarios where this skill applies].
---

# [Skill Title]

Brief overview of what this skill helps accomplish.

## When to Use This Skill

- Scenario 1
- Scenario 2
- Scenario 3

## Prerequisites

- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: [First Step]
Detailed instructions...

### Step 2: [Second Step]
Detailed instructions...

## Examples

### Example 1: [Scenario Name]

**Input**: Description of what the user provides

**Output**: Description of what the skill produces

## Resources

- [Resource Name](./path/to/resource.ext) - Description
- [Another Resource](./path/to/another.ext) - Description

## Best Practices

- Best practice 1
- Best practice 2

## Common Issues

### Issue 1
**Problem**: Description
**Solution**: How to fix it
```

## Progressive Loading Optimization

Skills use three-level loading for efficiency:

1. **Level 1 (Always loaded)**: Only `name` and `description` from frontmatter
2. **Level 2 (On match)**: Full `SKILL.md` body when description matches user request
3. **Level 3 (On demand)**: Additional files only when referenced

### Optimization Tips:

- Keep frontmatter description comprehensive but under 1024 characters
- Put most critical instructions at the top of the body
- Use separate files for large code examples or templates
- Reference files with relative paths: `[script](./scripts/run.sh)`

## Checklist for New Skills

Before publishing your skill, verify:

- [ ] `name` is lowercase with hyphens, max 64 chars
- [ ] `description` explains WHAT and WHEN, max 1024 chars
- [ ] Instructions are clear and actionable
- [ ] Examples demonstrate expected input/output
- [ ] All referenced files exist in the skill directory
- [ ] Relative paths are correct
- [ ] **SECURITY: No secrets, tokens, API keys, passwords, or credentials** (use environment variable references or placeholders instead)
- [ ] Tested with actual prompts that should trigger it

## Example: Creating a Code Review Skill

Here's a complete example of creating a skill:

### Directory Structure
```
.github/skills/code-review/
├── SKILL.md
├── checklists/
│   ├── security.md
│   └── performance.md
└── templates/
    └── review-comment.md
```

### SKILL.md Content
```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Performs thorough code reviews with security, performance, and maintainability checks. Use when reviewing pull requests, auditing code quality, or preparing code for production.
---

# Code Review Skill

Guides comprehensive code review following industry best practices.

## When to Use

- Reviewing a pull request
- Auditing existing code
- Pre-merge quality checks

## Review Process

### 1. Security Review
Check the [security checklist](./checklists/security.md) for:
- Input validation
- Authentication/Authorization
- Data sanitization

### 2. Performance Review  
Check the [performance checklist](./checklists/performance.md) for:
- N+1 queries
- Memory leaks
- Unnecessary re-renders

### 3. Generate Feedback
Use the [review template](./templates/review-comment.md) to structure feedback.
```

## Post-Creation: Verify Skill Discovery

After creating a skill in `~/.copilot/skills/`, VS Code automatically discovers it. To verify:

1. **Check skill is recognized**: Right-click in the Chat view and select **Diagnostics** to see all loaded skills
2. **Test activation**: Ask Copilot something that matches your skill's description
3. **Troubleshoot**: If the skill isn't loading:
   - Verify the SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter
   - Check that `name` and `description` fields are present
   - Ensure the description clearly describes when to use the skill

> **Note**: You can add additional skill locations using the `chat.agentSkillsLocations` setting if you want skills stored elsewhere.
>
> For example, to include both personal skills and runtime skills from dotnet/runtime:
> ```json
> "chat.agentSkillsLocations": [
>   "~/.copilot/skills",
>   "~/.copilot/skills/runtime-skills"
> ]
> ```


## Post-Creation: Git Workflow (REQUIRED)

After creating or modifying ANY skill in `~/.copilot/skills/`, the agent MUST:

1. **Check git status** in `~/.copilot/skills/`
2. **Stage changes**: `git add .`
3. **Commit** with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Add/Update {skill-name} skill"`
4. **Push to remote**: `git push`

If no remote is configured, prompt the user to set one up:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/{username}/copilot-skills.git
git push -u origin master
```

> ⚠️ **Do not skip this step.** Always verify changes are committed and pushed before completing the skill creation task.
