# Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA)

**Auto-activate when:** Making code changes, refactoring, modifying existing functions, changing APIs, renaming things, moving files, or reviewing implementations. Should activate alongside development-philosophy for any non-trivial changes.

## Core Principle

**Every change should be predictable to someone familiar with the codebase.**

If a change would surprise a developer who knows the project, either:
1. Don't make it
2. Make a smaller, less surprising change
3. Explain clearly before proceeding

---

## Before Making Changes

### The Surprise Check

Ask yourself:

1. **Would this surprise someone reading a diff?**
   - Unexpected file modifications
   - Unrelated changes bundled together
   - Renamed things without clear reason

2. **Does this follow existing patterns?**
   - Check neighboring files first
   - Match naming conventions already in use
   - Use established abstractions, don't invent new ones

3. **Is the scope what was requested?**
   - No unrequested refactors
   - No "improvements" beyond the ask
   - No adding features "while I'm here"

4. **Would the function/API do what its name suggests?**
   - No hidden side effects
   - No surprising return values
   - No unexpected mutations

---

## Common POLA Violations

### ❌ Scope Creep
```
Asked: "Fix the null check in validateUser"
Did: Fixed null check + refactored 3 other functions + added logging
```
**Why surprising:** Reviewer expects a small fix, gets a large diff.

### ❌ Hidden Side Effects
```python
def get_user(id):
    user = db.find(id)
    user.last_accessed = now()  # Mutation in a "get" function
    db.save(user)
    return user
```
**Why surprising:** "get" implies read-only; this writes.

### ❌ Inconsistent Naming
```python
# Existing codebase uses:
fetch_user(), fetch_orders(), fetch_products()

# New code adds:
retrieve_customer()  # Different verb AND different noun
```
**Why surprising:** Breaks established vocabulary.

### ❌ Unexpected File Changes
```
PR title: "Update README"
Files changed: README.md, config.py, utils.py, test_utils.py
```
**Why surprising:** Unrelated files modified.

### ❌ Silent Behavior Changes
```python
# Before: returned empty list on error
# After: raises exception on error
```
**Why surprising:** Callers expecting old behavior will break.

## POLA-Compliant Patterns

### ✅ Minimal Diffs
Change only what's necessary. If you notice something else that needs fixing, mention it separately.

### ✅ Match Existing Vocabulary
```python
# Codebase uses "fetch_*" pattern
def fetch_payments():  # Follows convention
    ...
```

### ✅ Explicit Over Implicit
```python
# Instead of hidden side effect:
def get_user(id):
    return db.find(id)

def get_and_update_access(id):  # Name reveals behavior
    user = db.find(id)
    user.last_accessed = now()
    db.save(user)
    return user
```

### ✅ Backward-Compatible Changes
```python
# Adding parameter with default preserves existing behavior
def process(data, validate=True):  # Old callers unaffected
    ...
```

### ✅ Predictable Return Types
```python
# Always return same type
def find_users(query) -> list[User]:
    # Return [] not None when empty
    return results or []
```

## When Larger Changes Are Needed

Sometimes breaking POLA is necessary. When it is:

1. **Announce it** - "This will change behavior for X"
2. **Explain why** - "Current approach causes Y problems"
3. **Offer alternatives** - "We could also do Z, which is less disruptive"
4. **Get explicit approval** - Don't assume silence means consent

---

## Quick Reference

| Situation | POLA-Compliant Approach |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Fixing a bug | Fix only that bug |
| Adding a feature | Add only that feature |
| Refactoring | Only when explicitly requested |
| Renaming | Match existing conventions |
| Changing return types | Add new function, deprecate old |
| Modifying APIs | Backward-compatible by default |

---

## Integration with Other Principles

- **KISS** - Simple solutions are usually less surprising
- **DRY** - But don't create abstractions that surprise (premature DRY violates POLA)
- **Consistency** - Following patterns is core to POLA

---

## TL;DR

**Do what the code reader expects. Match existing patterns. Keep changes focused. No surprises.**
