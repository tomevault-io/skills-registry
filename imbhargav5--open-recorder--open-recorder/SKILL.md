description: Prepare an Open Recorder GitHub release by choosing a patch, minor, or major version bump, dispatching the release PR workflow, and guiding the user through merging that PR so the actual release can publish. Use when the user asks to cut, ship, dispatch, or publish a GitHub release, or to bump the app version for a release. Use when this capability is needed.

# Publish GitHub Release

Use this skill when the user wants to publish an Open Recorder release from this repository.

## Quick start

Pick the script that matches the release type:

```bash
pnpm release:patch
pnpm release:minor
pnpm release:major
```

If the user wants to choose interactively, use:

```bash
pnpm release:dispatch
```

## Preconditions

Before running a release command:

1. Make sure the repo is on the branch the user wants to release from.
2. Make sure `gh auth status` succeeds.
3. If this release needs signed macOS artifacts and secrets are not configured yet, run:

```bash
pnpm release:setup-macos-signing
```

## Release type guidance

- `patch`: bug fixes, small polish, or safe maintenance updates.
- `minor`: new backward-compatible features.
- `major`: breaking changes or compatibility resets.

## Useful command patterns

You can pass extra flags through pnpm with `--`:

```bash
pnpm release:patch -- --notes "Bug fixes and stability improvements"
pnpm release:minor -- --name "Open Recorder v1.4.0" --yes
pnpm release:major -- --latest false
```

Supported flags come from `scripts/dispatch-release-build.mjs`:

- `--notes VALUE`
- `--name VALUE`
- `--latest true|false`
- `--yes`
- `--ref VALUE`
- `--repo OWNER/REPO`

## What the skill should do

1. Confirm the intended release type if the user did not already specify patch, minor, or major.
2. Check the preconditions above.
3. Run the matching root package script.
4. Report that the release PR workflow was dispatched and explain that GitHub Actions will calculate the next version and open or update the release PR.
5. If the user asks how the release process works or something fails, read [references/release-process.md](references/release-process.md).

## Important behaviors

- The local dispatcher does not update version files or create commits in the user's checkout.
- It dispatches `.github/workflows/release-pr.yml`, and that workflow computes the next version and opens or updates the release PR.
- Merging the release PR triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds and publishes the actual GitHub release.
