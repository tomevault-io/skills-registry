# Flutter Device CRUD Testing — Mobile MCP + Dart MCP

Systematically test **every interactive element** of a Flutter app on a real device or emulator using Mobile MCP (screenshot/tap/swipe/type) and Dart MCP (launch/hot_reload/runtime_errors/widget_tree/flutter_driver).

## When to Use

- Before release, to validate all pages visually and functionally
- After dark mode / theme changes, to verify readability
- After refactoring, to confirm no regressions
- When user says "跑一遍", "test all screens", "verify every button"

---

## Phase 0: Pre-flight — Codebase Analysis

Before touching any device, understand the app structure:

### 0.1 Read Router/Navigation
```
Find the app's router file (usually app_router.dart, router.dart, or main.dart):
- GoRouter: look for GoRoute, ShellRoute definitions
- Navigator 2.0: look for Router, RouteInformationParser
- Navigator 1.0: look for MaterialPageRoute, pushNamed calls

Output: List of ALL navigable screens with their paths.
```

### 0.2 Analyze Each Screen
```
For each screen .dart file, catalogue:

INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:
├── Buttons: ElevatedButton, TextButton, IconButton, FloatingActionButton
├── Inputs: TextField, TextFormField, SearchBar
├── Selection: ChoiceChip, FilterChip, Switch, Checkbox, Radio
│             SegmentedButton, DropdownButton, PopupMenuButton
├── Navigation: InkWell/GestureDetector with push/go/pop
│              ListTile with onTap, Card with onTap
├── Scrollable: RefreshIndicator, ListView, GridView, CustomScrollView
├── Dialogs: showDialog, showModalBottomSheet, showSnackBar
└── Special: Slider, DatePicker, TimePicker, ExpansionTile

EXPECTED BEHAVIORS:
├── CRUD: API calls, state mutations, provider updates
├── Navigation: route changes, page transitions, back navigation
├── UI Feedback: SnackBar, Toast, Dialog, loading indicator, shimmer
├── Validation: required field checks, format checks, error messages
└── State changes: toggle on/off, expand/collapse, select/deselect
```

### 0.3 Build Test Matrix

| # | Screen | Element | Action | Tool(s) | Expected Result |
|---|--------|---------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| 1.1 | Dashboard | — | Screenshot | take_screenshot | Layout correct |
| 1.2 | Dashboard | RefreshIndicator | swipe(down) | swipe_on_screen | Data refreshes |
| 1.3 | Dashboard | Item card | Tap | list_elements→click | Nav to detail |
| 1.4 | Detail | Back button | Tap | click | Returns to list |
| 2.1 | Form | Name field | Type text | click→type_keys | Text appears |
| 2.2 | Form | Submit (empty) | Tap | click | Validation error |
| 2.3 | Form | Submit (filled) | Tap | click | Success feedback |
| 3.1 | Settings | Theme toggle | Tap | click | Theme changes |
| 3.2 | Settings | Switch | Toggle | click | State flips |

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Launch

### 1.1 Identify Device
```
→ mobile_mcp list_available_devices
→ Pick iOS Simulator or Android Emulator
→ Prefer a named testing device (e.g., "E2E-iPhone16Pro")
→ Note the device ID for all subsequent calls
```

### 1.2 Launch App
```
→ dart_mcp launch_app(root=<project_root>, device=<device_id>)
→ Returns DTD URI — save it!
→ ⚠️ First launch can take 60-120 seconds for iOS Simulator
```

### 1.3 Connect Dart Tooling Daemon
```
→ dart_mcp connect_dart_tooling_daemon(uri=<dtd_uri>)
→ This enables: runtime errors, hot reload, widget tree
```

### 1.4 Verify Launch
```
→ mobile_mcp take_screenshot(device)
→ Confirm app is on screen and not showing a crash/error
→ Save screenshot as baseline
```

### ⚠️ Launch Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `launch_app` hangs >3 min | Kill zombie Flutter processes: `flutter_driver` or `dart` processes. Check with `ps aux \| grep flutter` |
| DTD URI connection fails | Re-launch the app, get fresh URI. **Never reuse old URIs.** |
| App shows white screen | Check `get_runtime_errors()` — likely a provider/init crash |
| Simulator not found | Run `xcrun simctl list devices` or check Android emulator is running |
| "No supported devices" | Ensure device platform matches app targets (iOS/Android) |

---

## Phase 2: Execute Tests — Screen by Screen

### Core Loop: For each screen

```
NAVIGATE → SCREENSHOT → INTERACT → VERIFY → RECORD
```

### Step A: Navigate to Screen

**Bottom Tab Navigation (most common):**
```
1. mobile_mcp list_elements_on_screen(device)
2. Find tab label by text (e.g., "Home", "Settings", "Profile")
3. mobile_mcp click_on_screen_at_coordinates(device, x, y)
4. Wait 1-2 seconds for animation
```

**Push Navigation (detail pages):**
```
1. Find the trigger element (list item, card, button)
2. Tap it → app pushes new route
3. Verify new screen loaded via screenshot
```

**Deep Link / Direct Navigation (if supported):**
```
1. Use mobile_mcp open_url(device, url) for deep links
```

### Step B: Screenshot Initial State
```
→ mobile_mcp take_screenshot(device)
→ Save screenshot path for walkthrough
→ This is your BEFORE state
```

### Step C: Test Each Interactive Element

Process elements **top to bottom, left to right** on the screen.

**For each element:**
```
1. LOCATE
   → mobile_mcp list_elements_on_screen(device)
   → Find element by text, accessibility label, or type
   → ⚠️ NEVER guess coordinates — ALWAYS call list_elements first

2. TRIGGER ACTION
   → Button/Chip/Toggle: click_on_screen_at_coordinates(device, x, y)
   → Text input: click(field) → type_keys(device, text, submit=false)
   → Scroll: swipe_on_screen(device, direction, distance)
   → Pull-to-refresh: swipe_on_screen(device, direction="down", y=300)

3. VERIFY RESULT
   → mobile_mcp take_screenshot(device)          // Visual check
   → dart_mcp get_runtime_errors()                // Zero-crash check
   → mobile_mcp list_elements_on_screen(device)   // New UI state

4. RECORD
   → Save screenshot + pass/fail status
   → If error: save error details + screenshot as evidence
```

### Step D: Edge Cases per Screen Type

**Form Screens:**
```
- [ ] Submit empty form → expect validation error (SnackBar/inline)
- [ ] Submit with only partial fields → expect specific field error
- [ ] Submit with valid data → expect success feedback
- [ ] Submit twice rapidly → no duplicate submission
- [ ] Type very long text → no overflow / text truncation is graceful
```

**List Screens:**
```
- [ ] Empty state → appropriate "no data" message
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh → RefreshIndicator appears, data reloads
- [ ] Scroll to bottom → no overflow, footer visible or infinite scroll works
- [ ] Tap item → navigates to detail
- [ ] Swipe item (if dismissible) → delete/archive action
```

**Detail Screens:**
```
- [ ] Back navigation → returns to previous screen with state preserved
- [ ] Action buttons (edit/delete/share) → appropriate action or confirmation
- [ ] Scroll through all content → no clipping or overflow
```

**Settings Screens:**
```
- [ ] Toggle switches → state persists after leaving and returning
- [ ] Theme change → entire app re-renders correctly
- [ ] Segmented buttons → correct option selected visually
- [ ] External links → url_launcher opens browser/app
```

**Chat/Input Screens:**
```
- [ ] Send message → appears in chat
- [ ] Suggestions/quick actions → tapping sends or fills input
- [ ] Keyboard appears → content scrolls up, not covered
- [ ] Dismiss keyboard → layout returns to normal
```

### Step E: Navigate Back / Cleanup
```
→ Return to stable state before testing next screen
→ Android: mobile_mcp press_button(device, "BACK")
→ iOS: Tap back arrow or swipe right
→ Or tap the next bottom tab directly
```

---

## Phase 3: Cross-Cutting Tests

### 3.1 Theme Testing
```
1. Run core visual checks in default (light) mode
2. Navigate to Settings → switch to Dark mode
3. Re-check EVERY screen for:
   - Text contrast (no invisible text on dark backgrounds)
   - Card backgrounds (not clashing with dark bg)
   - Icon visibility
   - Input field hint text readability
   - SnackBar/Dialog contrast
4. Switch to System mode → verify it follows device setting
```

### 3.2 Rotation Testing (if relevant)
```
→ mobile_mcp set_orientation(device, "landscape")
→ Screenshot each main screen
→ mobile_mcp set_orientation(device, "portrait")
→ Verify layout restored
```

### 3.3 State Persistence Testing
```
1. Fill a form partially
2. Switch to another tab
3. Return to the form tab
4. Verify: data preserved or intentionally cleared?
```

### 3.4 Error State Testing
```
1. Turn off network (if possible on emulator)
2. Trigger API-dependent features
3. Verify: error messages shown, app doesn't crash
4. Turn network back on → verify recovery
```

---

## Phase 4: Validation Checkpoints

### After EVERY action, run:

```python
# 1. Runtime error check — NON-NEGOTIABLE
dart_mcp get_runtime_errors()
# If errors found → STOP, document error, take screenshot

# 2. Visual verification
mobile_mcp take_screenshot(device)
# Save to artifacts directory

# 3. Widget tree check (for deep issues)
dart_mcp get_widget_tree(summaryOnly=true)
# Verify expected widget types are present
```

### Error Handling Decision Tree

```
Error Found?
├── RenderFlex overflow → P2, cosmetic, note and continue
├── Null check error → P0, crash, STOP and fix
├── setState after dispose → P1, memory leak, note and continue
├── Network/API error → Expected in test env? If yes, note. If no, P1.
├── Framework assertion → P0, structural bug, STOP and fix
└── No error → ✅ Continue
```

---

## Phase 5: Common Interaction Patterns

### Tap a Button by Text
```
elements = mobile_mcp list_elements_on_screen(device)
# Find element with matching text → get center coordinates
mobile_mcp click_on_screen_at_coordinates(device, x, y)
```

### Fill a Text Field
```
# 1. Tap the field to focus
mobile_mcp click_on_screen_at_coordinates(device, fieldX, fieldY)
# 2. Type text
mobile_mcp type_keys(device, text="測試文字", submit=false)
# 3. If keyboard blocks next element, dismiss:
#    - Android: mobile_mcp press_button(device, "BACK")
#    - iOS: tap outside the field
```

### Select a ChoiceChip / SegmentedButton
```
elements = mobile_mcp list_elements_on_screen(device)
# Find chip by label text → get coordinates
mobile_mcp click_on_screen_at_coordinates(device, chipX, chipY)
# Verify: chip now shows selected state (different color/style)
```

### Pull-to-Refresh
```
mobile_mcp swipe_on_screen(device, direction="down", y=400)
# Wait ~2 seconds for refresh to complete
mobile_mcp take_screenshot(device)
```

### Scroll Down (to reveal more content)
```
mobile_mcp swipe_on_screen(device, direction="up")
# ↑ swipe UP = scroll DOWN (finger motion direction)
```

### Toggle a Switch
```
# Switches often don't have text labels in list_elements
# Use the coordinates from list_elements for the parent ListTile
mobile_mcp click_on_screen_at_coordinates(device, switchX, switchY)
```

### Navigate via Bottom Tab
```
elements = mobile_mcp list_elements_on_screen(device)
# Bottom nav labels are stable regardless of scroll position
# Find by label text → click
mobile_mcp click_on_screen_at_coordinates(device, tabX, tabY)
```

### Dismiss a Dialog / Bottom Sheet
```
# Option 1: Tap the action button (OK, Cancel, etc.)
mobile_mcp click_on_screen_at_coordinates(device, btnX, btnY)
# Option 2: Tap outside the dialog (on the scrim)
mobile_mcp click_on_screen_at_coordinates(device, 50, 50)
# Option 3: Android back button
mobile_mcp press_button(device, "BACK")
```

### Handle Keyboard Covering Content
```
# After typing in a TextField, keyboard may cover buttons below.
# Solutions:
# 1. Scroll down while keyboard is up
mobile_mcp swipe_on_screen(device, direction="up", distance=300)
# 2. Dismiss keyboard first
mobile_mcp press_button(device, "BACK")  # Android
# 3. Tap outside the text field
mobile_mcp click_on_screen_at_coordinates(device, 200, 100)  # Safe empty area
```

## Phase 6: Using Dart MCP Flutter Driver (Advanced)

For programmatic interaction without coordinate guessing:

### Find a Widget by Text and Tap
```
dart_mcp flutter_driver(
  command="tap",
  finderType="ByText",
  text="Submit"
)
```

### Find a Widget by Type
```
dart_mcp flutter_driver(
  command="tap",
  finderType="ByType",
  type="FloatingActionButton"
)
```

### Find a Widget by Key
```
dart_mcp flutter_driver(
  command="tap",
  finderType="ByValueKey",
  keyValueString="submit_button",
  keyValueType="String"
)
```

### Enter Text into a TextField
```
# First tap to focus
dart_mcp flutter_driver(command="tap", finderType="ByType", type="TextField")
# Then enter text
dart_mcp flutter_driver(command="enter_text", text="測試內容")
```

### Get Text Content
```
dart_mcp flutter_driver(
  command="get_text",
  finderType="ByValueKey",
  keyValueString="total_count",
  keyValueType="String"
)
```

### Wait for Widget to Appear
```
dart_mcp flutter_driver(
  command="waitFor",
  finderType="ByText",
  text="Success!",
  timeout="10000"
)
```

### Scroll Into View
```
dart_mcp flutter_driver(
  command="scrollIntoView",
  finderType="ByValueKey",
  keyValueString="footer_widget",
  keyValueType="String",
  alignment="0.0"
)
```

### Get Widget Tree (for debugging)
```
dart_mcp flutter_driver(
  command="get_diagnostics_tree",
  finderType="ByType",
  type="Scaffold",
  diagnosticsType="widget",
  subtreeDepth="3",
  includeProperties="true"
)
```

### ⚠️ Flutter Driver Gotchas
1. **Cannot find tooltips**: ByTooltipMessage only matches Tooltip widgets
2. **ByText is literal**: Must match exactly (case-sensitive, including trailing spaces)
3. **Multiple matches**: If multiple widgets match, it taps the FIRST one found
4. **Nested finders**: Use Descendant/Ancestor for complex widget trees
5. **Timing**: Use `waitFor` before `tap` if the widget loads asynchronously
6. **get_widget_tree first**: Always use `get_widget_tree` before trying to tap widgets via driver so you know exact widget types and text that exist

## Tips & Gotchas

1. **`list_elements` is essential** — NEVER guess coordinates. Always call `list_elements_on_screen` first. Coordinates change with screen size, orientation, and content.

2. **Take screenshots liberally** — They're your proof of work. Embed them in walkthroughs. Save them with descriptive names.

3. **Check runtime errors after EVERY action** — Not just at the end. Errors can cascade. A single uncaught error can invalidate all subsequent tests.

4. **Keyboard may cover buttons** — After typing, dismiss keyboard via `press_button(BACK)` on Android or tap outside the field on iOS before trying to tap elements below.

5. **Animations take time** — Wait 1-2 seconds after navigation before taking screenshots. Let transitions complete.

6. **Bottom nav coordinates are stable** — They don't change with scroll, so you can reuse coordinates across tests within the same session.

7. **For both themes** — Run the full suite once in light mode, switch to dark via Settings, then rerun key visual checks.

8. **Hot reload for fixes** — If you find and fix a bug mid-test, use `dart_mcp hot_reload()` to apply without restarting. But remember: hot reload doesn't update `const` values or global initializers — use `hot_restart()` for those.

9. **Don't use browser subagents** — Mobile MCP tools are direct device controls. Never try to control a simulator through a browser subagent — it won't work and wastes time.

10. **Device list can change** — If a simulator crashes or disconnects, re-check `list_available_devices` before continuing.

11. **GoRouter ShellRoute = nested Scaffolds** — SnackBars may appear behind bottom navigation. If testing SnackBars, verify they're visible by checking the screenshot carefully.

12. **Save screenshots to artifacts** — Use `mobile_mcp save_screenshot(device, saveTo=<path>)` for persistent storage. `take_screenshot` returns a transient image.

13. **Process cleanup before testing** — Kill zombie processes that may interfere:
    ```
    # Kill lingering Flutter/Dart processes
    pkill -f "flutter_tools"
    pkill -f "dart.*tooling_daemon"
    # Kill stuck Gradle daemons (Android)
    pkill -f "GradleDaemon"
    ```

14. **Timeout on `launch_app`** — iOS Simulator cold starts can take 2+ minutes. If it seems stuck, check if Xcode is doing a first-run compilation.

15. **ChoiceChip testing** — When testing chip selection, verify BOTH:
    - The newly selected chip has selected styling
    - The previously selected chip lost its selected styling
