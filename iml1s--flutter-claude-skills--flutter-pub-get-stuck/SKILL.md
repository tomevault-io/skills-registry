# Flutter CLI Stuck / Hangs / Invalid SDK Hash — Diagnosis & Fix

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- `flutter pub get`, `flutter build`, `flutter run`, or ANY Flutter CLI command hangs indefinitely (no output for > 30 seconds)
- You see `Can't load Kernel binary: Invalid SDK hash` error
- `fvm flutter` commands produce zero output
- Flutter commands were working before but suddenly stopped

## Root Cause Checklist

Work through these **in order** — each step resolves a progressively deeper issue.

### 1. 🧟 Zombie dart.exe / java.exe Processes (Most Common)

**Symptoms:** Flutter command shows no output, or hangs at "Resolving dependencies..."

**Diagnosis:**
```powershell
Get-Process -Name dart,flutter,java -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Format-Table Name,Id,CPU,WS -AutoSize
```

**Key Indicators:**
- More than 5 dart.exe processes → likely zombies
- Any dart.exe using > 200MB memory (WS column) → stuck analysis/compilation
- java.exe running > 500MB → Gradle daemon holding resources
- A `flutter run` running for hours in another terminal → WILL block everything
- IDE analysis server constantly respawning dart.exe → kill IDE too

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Kill all Flutter-related processes
Get-Process dart,java,flutter -ea 0 | Stop-Process -Force -ea 0
Start-Sleep 2
# Verify zero remaining
Get-Process dart,java -ea 0 | Measure-Object | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Count
```

> [!WARNING]
> The IDE (VS Code / Android Studio) analysis server will **respawn** dart.exe processes. If zombies keep coming back, close the IDE first.

### 2. 🔒 Flutter SDK Lockfile

**Symptoms:** Zero output from any Flutter command. Zombie processes already killed but still hangs.

**Diagnosis & Fix:**

For FVM projects, first find the SDK path:
```powershell
# Read .fvmrc to find the Flutter version
Get-Content .fvmrc
# Common FVM paths on Windows:
#   C:\Users\<USER>\fvm\versions\<version>\
#   C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\fvm\versions\<version>\
```

Then remove the lockfile:
```powershell
$sdkCache = "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\fvm\versions\<VERSION>\bin\cache"
Remove-Item "$sdkCache\lockfile" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$sdkCache\flutter.bat.lock" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Pub\Cache\lock" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### 3. 💀 Corrupted bin/cache — "Invalid SDK Hash" (Nuclear Option)

**Symptoms:**
- `Can't load Kernel binary: Invalid SDK hash` error
- Flutter commands hang even after killing processes and removing lockfiles
- `dart.exe --version` works but `flutter --version` hangs
- Deleting just the snapshot or lockfile doesn't help

**Root Cause:** The Dart SDK cached inside `bin/cache/dart-sdk/` is mismatched with the Flutter SDK version, or the `flutter_tools.snapshot` is corrupted. This typically happens after:
- Interrupted `flutter upgrade`
- Multiple FVM version switches
- Disk space issues during SDK download
- System crashes during Flutter operations

**Fix — Delete entire bin/cache:**
```powershell
# Step 1: Kill ALL dart/java processes
Get-Process dart,java,flutter -ea 0 | Stop-Process -Force -ea 0
Start-Sleep 2

# Step 2: Delete the entire bin/cache directory
$sdkPath = "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\fvm\versions\<VERSION>"
cmd /c "rd /s /q $sdkPath\bin\cache"
# If rd fails on locked files, kill cmd.exe processes holding locks:
# Get-Process cmd -ea 0 | Stop-Process -Force -ea 0
# Then retry rd

# Step 3: Verify deletion
Test-Path "$sdkPath\bin\cache"  # Should return False

# Step 4: Reactivate FVM (fixes FVM's own snapshot mismatch)
& "$sdkPath\bin\cache\dart-sdk\bin\dart.exe" pub global deactivate fvm
& "$sdkPath\bin\cache\dart-sdk\bin\dart.exe" pub global activate fvm
# If dart.exe doesn't exist yet (cache deleted), use system dart:
# dart pub global deactivate fvm; dart pub global activate fvm

# Step 5: Run flutter doctor to trigger fresh SDK download
fvm flutter doctor -v
# This will:
#   - Download Dart SDK from Flutter engine
#   - Expand archive
#   - Build flutter_tools
#   - Run pub upgrade
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `Remove-Item -Recurse` in PowerShell often **silently fails** on locked files. Always use `cmd /c "rd /s /q <path>"` for reliable recursive deletion, and verify with `Test-Path` afterward.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After deleting `bin/cache`, Flutter will re-download ~200MB of Dart SDK. Make sure you have internet connectivity. The first `flutter doctor` after cache deletion takes 2-5 minutes.

### 4. 📡 Network Issues (pub.dev unreachable)

**Diagnosis:**
```powershell
ping pub.dev -n 3
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://pub.dev" -UseBasicParsing -TimeoutSec 5
```

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Use Chinese mirror if behind firewall
$env:PUB_HOSTED_URL = "https://pub.flutter-io.cn"
$env:FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL = "https://storage.flutter-io.cn"
flutter pub get
```

### 5. 🧹 Corrupted Pub Cache

**Fix:**
```powershell
flutter clean
Remove-Item pubspec.lock -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
flutter pub cache repair
flutter pub get
```

## One-Liner Emergency Fix

```powershell
# Kill everything → delete locks → clean → retry
Get-Process dart,java,flutter -ea 0 | Stop-Process -Force; Start-Sleep 2; Remove-Item pubspec.lock -ea 0; fvm flutter clean; fvm flutter pub get
```

## Nuclear One-Liner (when Invalid SDK hash)

```powershell
# Kill everything → nuke cache → reactivate FVM → rebuild
Get-Process dart,java -ea 0 | Stop-Process -Force; Start-Sleep 2; cmd /c "rd /s /q C:\Users\%USERNAME%\fvm\versions\<VERSION>\bin\cache"; dart pub global deactivate fvm; dart pub global activate fvm; fvm flutter doctor -v
```

## Finding the FVM SDK Path

The FVM SDK path varies across machines. To find it programmatically:

```powershell
# Method 1: Check where fvm.bat is located
where.exe fvm
# Usually: C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin\fvm.bat

# Method 2: Look for flutter.bat in the user's fvm directory
Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\fvm\versions" -Filter "flutter.bat" -Recurse -Depth 3 -ea 0 | Select-Object -First 5 -ExpandProperty FullName

# Method 3: Common locations
# C:\Users\<USER>\fvm\versions\<VERSION>\bin\flutter.bat
# C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\fvm\versions\<VERSION>\bin\flutter.bat
```

## Prevention

1. **Always stop `flutter run` before running `flutter pub get`** — a hot-reloading session locks Dart processes
2. **Don't run multiple Flutter CLI commands simultaneously** in different terminals
3. **Close IDE before major cleanup operations** — the analysis server respawns dart.exe
4. **Check for zombie processes** if your machine feels slow or after IDE crashes
5. **Don't interrupt `flutter upgrade`** — if you must, delete `bin/cache` afterward
6. **When using FVM, stick to one version per terminal session** — rapid version switching can corrupt the cache

## Related skills

- **`systematic-debugging`** — use when flutter pub get hangs to diagnose whether it's a process lock, network issue, or corrupted cache.
- **`fvm-flutter-release`** — for release builds, ensure flutter pub get completes cleanly before using FVM for version-specific builds.
