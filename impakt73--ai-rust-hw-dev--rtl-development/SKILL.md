## Multi-cycle Architecture

### FSM States

The CPU uses a 12-state finite state machine:

1. **S_BOOT (0x0):** After reset, waits for boot signal before first fetch
2. **S_FETCH (0x1):** Request instruction from memory, wait for `imem_ready`
3. **S_DECODE (0x2):** Decode instruction, read registers
4. **S_EXECUTE (0x3):** Execute ALU operation
5. **S_MEM_ADDR (0x4):** Calculate memory address for load/store
6. **S_MEM_READ (0x5):** Request data from memory, wait for `dmem_ready`
7. **S_MEM_WRITE (0x6):** Write data to memory, wait for `dmem_ready`
8. **S_WRITEBACK (0x7):** Write result to destination register
9. **S_BRANCH (0x8):** Evaluate branch condition and update PC
10. **S_CSR (0x9):** Execute CSR operation
11. **S_ATOMIC_RMW (0xB):** Atomic read-modify-write operations
12. **S_HALT (0xA):** ECALL/EBREAK halt state

### Instruction Cycle Counts

Different instruction types require different numbers of cycles:

| Instruction Class | Base Cycles | States |
|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| R-type (ADD, SUB, etc.) | 4 | FETCH → DECODE → EXECUTE → WRITEBACK |
| I-type Arithmetic | 4 | FETCH → DECODE → EXECUTE → WRITEBACK |
| Load (LW, LH, LB) | 5 | FETCH → DECODE → MEM_ADDR → MEM_READ → WRITEBACK |
| Store (SW, SH, SB) | 4 | FETCH → DECODE → MEM_ADDR → MEM_WRITE |
| Branch | 3 | FETCH → DECODE → BRANCH |
| Jump (JAL/JALR) | 4 | FETCH → DECODE → EXECUTE → WRITEBACK |
| Upper Immediate | 4 | FETCH → DECODE → EXECUTE → WRITEBACK |
| M-Extension (MUL/DIV) | 4 | FETCH → DECODE → EXECUTE → WRITEBACK |
| System (FENCE) | 2 | FETCH → DECODE |
| System (ECALL/EBREAK) | 2 | FETCH → DECODE → HALT |
| CSR Operations | 4 | FETCH → DECODE → CSR → WRITEBACK |

**Note:** Memory latency adds additional cycles. For example, with 3-cycle memory latency, a load instruction takes 5 base cycles + 3 cycles in FETCH + 3 cycles in MEM_READ = 11 total cycles.

### Memory Interface Signals

The multi-cycle design adds handshaking signals:

**Instruction Memory:**
- `imem_req` (output): CPU requests instruction fetch
- `imem_ready` (input): Memory has valid instruction data
- `imem_addr` (output): Instruction address
- `imem_data` (input): Instruction data

**Data Memory:**
- `dmem_req` (output): CPU requests memory operation
- `dmem_ready` (input): Memory operation complete
- `dmem_addr` (output): Data address
- `dmem_wdata` (output): Write data
- `dmem_rdata` (input): Read data
- `dmem_we` (output): Write enable
- `dmem_re` (output): Read enable
- `dmem_size` (output): Operation size (byte/halfword/word)

### Instruction Completion Signal

- `instr_complete` (output): High for 1 cycle when instruction finishes execution

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Multi-cycle execution:** Instructions take 3-5+ base cycles plus variable memory latency
2. **FSM-based control:** 12-state finite state machine
3. **Variable-latency memory:** Ready/valid handshaking on instruction and data memory interfaces
4. **Exposed memory ports:** Instruction and data memory are external (managed by testbench)
5. **Register x0 hardwired to zero:** Hardware enforcement (not just software convention)
6. **Separate branch unit:** Dedicated branch comparison logic (not ALU-based)
7. **CSR support:** Full Control and Status Register implementation (Zicsr extension)
8. **FIFO-based debug:** MMIO FIFO at 0x40000000 for host communication with packet protocol
9. **Staging registers:** Flip-flop based intermediate storage for multi-cycle operation (FPGA-safe, no latches)

## Coding Conventions

### Signal Naming
- Use `snake_case` for signal names
- Prefix with purpose: `imem_`, `dmem_`, `alu_`, etc.
- Keep ports consistent with RISC-V naming: `rs1`, `rs2`, `rd`, `funct3`, etc.

### Reset Conventions
- Use **synchronous resets only** in project RTL modules.
- Default to active-high reset ports as `rst` for internal RTL modules. The supported FPGA flows map these resets efficiently without extra inversion logic, so active-high remains the project default.
- For sequential logic, use `always_ff @(posedge clk)` (or the local clock domain) and perform reset inside the block with `if (rst)`.
- Reserve active-low resets for special cases, usually external board or device signals that already arrive active-low. Convert those signals to the internal active-high convention as close to the boundary as practical.
- When a datapath payload register has a separate `valid`, `pending`, or similar control bit, reset the control bit rather than the payload register itself. Write or refresh the payload whenever you capture new data, typically in the same branch where you set/assert the control bit, and downstream logic must ignore the payload whenever that control bit is low.
- Avoiding resets on payload-only registers reduces reset fanout and routing congestion on FPGA hardware without changing functional behavior.

### Timing and Frequency Priority
- **Maximizing achievable Fmax and timing margin is a repo priority.** Prefer registered signals and shorter combinational cones to improve timing closure against the documented target constraint.
- Default to **multi-cycle staging** when needed instead of forcing large arithmetic, mux, compare, or control cones into a single cycle for Fmax.
- Prefer registering **intermediate values and outputs** at natural boundaries (`register -> logic -> register`) whenever that does not require major architectural changes.
- Signals that cannot be registered without major architectural changes—especially ready/valid-style handshake returns such as `*_ready`—are exempt from this guidance.
- When an unregistered path is kept for architectural reasons, document the exemption clearly so the timing trade-off is explicit.

### `default_nettype` Guards (MANDATORY)

Every `.sv` file **must** begin with `` `default_nettype none `` and end with `` `default_nettype wire ``:

```systemverilog
`default_nettype none
// … file content …
`default_nettype wire
```

- The opening `` `default_nettype none `` turns implicit net declarations into compile errors, catching undeclared signals before they silently become 1-bit wires.
- The closing `` `default_nettype wire `` restores the default so the guard does not bleed into other files included after this one.
- All project `.sv` files already carry these guards. Any new file added under `rtl/` must include them.

### Linting
```bash
# Lint SystemVerilog files before committing (RTL files are in subdirectories)
find rtl/common -name '*.sv' -exec verilator --lint-only --Wno-MULTITOP {} +
```

All SystemVerilog code should pass Verilator linting before being committed.

### FPGA Synthesis Verification
```bash
# Verify RTL can be synthesized to FPGA (whenever SystemVerilog is modified)
(cd rtl/fpga && make)
```

**Important:** CI automatically runs FPGA synthesis verification on all SystemVerilog changes. The design must successfully synthesize to the default ECP5 target (`ecp5_icepi_zero`) using Yosys/nextpnr-ecp5.

**Key constraints:**
- Target frequency: 50 MHz
- Resource limit: 24,288 LUT4-class combinational cells
- The default open-source target keeps `ENABLE_F_EXT=0`; check current build reports for the latest resource/timing headroom

## Debugging Hardware

**CRITICAL RULE:** When debugging hardware, **NEVER rely heavily on abstract reasoning** about what signals "should" be doing.

### Correct Debugging Approach

1. **Add `$display()` statements** to observe actual signal values
2. **Print state transitions** to see FSM behavior
3. **Observe timing** with cycle-by-cycle output
4. **Base hypotheses on concrete data** from simulation
5. **Verify assumptions** with additional instrumentation

### Example Debug Instrumentation

```systemverilog
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if (state == S_FETCH) begin
        $display("FETCH: pc=%h instr=%h imem_ready=%b", pc, imem_data, imem_ready);
    end
    if (state == S_EXECUTE) begin
        $display("EXECUTE: alu_op=%h rs1_data=%h rs2_data=%h result=%h", 
                 alu_op, rs1_data, rs2_data, alu_result);
    end
end
```

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Assuming signal values without checking them
- ❌ Predicting FSM state transitions without observation
- ❌ Guessing timing relationships
- ❌ Reasoning through complex logic without concrete data

**Key Principle:** Treat hardware debugging like experimental science - observe first, then reason based on evidence.
