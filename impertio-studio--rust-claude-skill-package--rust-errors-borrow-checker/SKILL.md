# rust-errors-borrow-checker

How to read and fix the six most common borrow-checker errors: E0382, E0502, E0596, E0499, E0500, E0716. Every fix patches the **root cause** (ownership shape, scope, mutability declaration), not the symptom. `.clone()` is the **last resort**, not the first.

Cross-references: [[rust-syntax-ownership]] (move semantics), [[rust-syntax-borrowing]] (`&T` vs `&mut T` rules, NLL, split borrows), [[rust-syntax-lifetimes]] (lifetime annotations on borrows), [[rust-errors-lifetimes]] (E0106 / E0623 / E0495 / E0700 / E0759), [[rust-agents-compile-fix]] (orchestration recipe for any rustc error).

---

## When to use this skill

- Compiler reports one of E0382, E0502, E0596, E0499, E0500, E0716 (or the post-NLL un-numbered variants that print the same message).
- User asks "why can't I use this variable after I passed it / assigned it / matched on it".
- User asks "why does Rust forbid `&` and `&mut` together".
- User pastes a borrow-checker message and asks for a fix.
- User reaches for `.clone()` as the default escape hatch.

If the message contains "lifetime" or `'a` / `'static` symbols, use [[rust-errors-lifetimes]] instead.

```

ALWAYS map the message to the error code first. NEVER guess a fix from the line number alone.

## E0382: use of moved value

**Official summary (verbatim):** *"A variable was used after its contents have been moved elsewhere."* Source: `rustc_error_codes/E0382.md`.

### Root cause

A non-`Copy` value (`String`, `Vec`, `Box`, custom struct without `derive(Copy)`, etc.) was moved by:
- assignment to another binding (`let y = x;`)
- pass to a function by value (`takes_ownership(x);`)
- pattern bind in `match` / `if let` without `ref` / `ref mut`
- being captured by-move in a closure
- being put into a container (`vec.push(x);`)

After the move, the original binding is uninitialised. Using it triggers E0382.

### Erroneous example

```rust
struct MyStruct { s: u32 }

fn main() {
    let mut x = MyStruct { s: 5 };
    let y = x;          // moves x into y
    x.s = 6;            // E0382: use of moved value `x`
    println!("{}", x.s);
}
```

### Fix patterns (apply in this priority order)

1. **Borrow instead of move.** If the consumer only reads, take `&T`. If it writes, take `&mut T`. ALWAYS try this first.
   ```rust
   fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { s.len() } // borrow, not move
   let s1 = String::from("hello");
   let n = calculate_length(&s1);
   println!("{s1} {n}"); // s1 still valid
   ```

2. **Restructure ownership** so the function takes ownership only when it really keeps the value. Return the value back if the caller needs it after.
   ```rust
   fn process(s: String) -> String { /* mutate */ s }
   let mut s = String::from("hello");
   s = process(s); // ownership returned
   ```

3. **`std::mem::take(&mut x)`** for types implementing `Default`. Leaves `x = T::default()` so `x` is still initialised.
   ```rust
   use std::mem;
   let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
   let taken = mem::take(&mut v); // v is now empty Vec, taken owns [1,2,3]
   ```

4. **`std::mem::replace(&mut x, new)`** swaps out the value, gives you the old one. Use when you must put a specific replacement, not `Default`.
   ```rust
   use std::mem;
   let mut s = String::from("old");
   let old = mem::replace(&mut s, String::from("new")); // s = "new", old = "old"
   ```

5. **`.clone()`** ONLY when (a) the data is small / `Copy`-ish, (b) you genuinely need two independent owners, and (c) you have already considered patterns 1 to 4. Document why a clone is correct, not a workaround.

NEVER add `.clone()` without first asking "can I borrow instead". `.clone()` on a `String` or `Vec` copies the heap allocation; `clippy::redundant_clone` will flag obvious abuses.

### After-NLL improvement

The error is reported at the **use** site, after NLL (Rust 2018+). The compiler often suggests the exact line to clone or borrow. ALWAYS read the suggestion before guessing.

## E0502: cannot borrow as mutable because also borrowed as immutable

**Official summary (verbatim):** *"A variable already borrowed with a certain mutability (either mutable or immutable) was borrowed again with a different mutability."* Source: `rustc_error_codes/E0502.md`.

### Root cause

Rust's rule: at any point, **either one `&mut` xor any number of `&`** to the same value. Two overlapping borrows of different mutability violate this.

### Erroneous example

```rust
fn bar(x: &mut i32) {}
fn foo(a: &mut i32) {
    let y = &a;     // immutable borrow of a
    bar(a);         // E0502: cannot borrow `*a` as mutable because also borrowed as immutable
    println!("{y}");
}
```

### Fix patterns

1. **Tighten the shared borrow scope (NLL).** Use the shared borrow, finish using it, *then* reborrow as `&mut`. NLL ends a borrow at its last use, not at the closing brace.
   ```rust
   fn foo(a: &mut i32) {
       let y = &a;
       println!("{y}");  // last use of y, borrow ends here
       bar(a);           // OK, now mutable borrow is fresh
   }
   ```

2. **Extract the read into a local** so the `&` borrow ends before the `&mut` begins.
   ```rust
   let len = vec.len();          // borrow ends after `len` is bound (Copy)
   vec.push(len);                // mutable borrow OK
   ```

3. **Restructure to avoid simultaneous borrow.** Read first, write second; or write first, read second. Never both in flight.

4. **Two-phase borrows** already cover the common case `vec.push(vec.len())` since Rust 1.18. If your code looks like this and still fails, the issue is more subtle (often E0499); see that section.

NEVER reach for `Arc` / `RefCell` to evade E0502. Those tools exist for genuine shared-ownership and interior-mutability problems, not for scope errors.

---

## E0596: cannot borrow as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable

**Official summary (verbatim):** *"This error occurs because you tried to mutably borrow a non-mutable variable."* Source: `rustc_error_codes/E0596.md`.

### Root cause

A binding declared without `mut` cannot be borrowed `&mut`. A method declared `&self` cannot mutate the receiver.

### Erroneous examples

```rust
let x = 1;
let y = &mut x; // E0596: cannot borrow `x` as mutable
```

```rust
struct Counter { n: u32 }
impl Counter {
    fn bump(&self) { self.n += 1; } // E0596: `self` is &, not &mut
}
```

### Fix patterns

1. **Add `mut` to the binding.**
   ```rust
   let mut x = 1;
   let y = &mut x; // OK
   ```

2. **Change `&self` to `&mut self`** on the method that mutates.
   ```rust
   impl Counter {
       fn bump(&mut self) { self.n += 1; }
   }
   ```

3. **If the receiver must stay `&self`** (e.g. trait method signature), use **interior mutability**: `Cell<T>` (for `Copy`), `RefCell<T>` (single-threaded, runtime-checked), `Mutex<T>` / `RwLock<T>` (thread-safe). See [[rust-syntax-borrowing]].
   ```rust
   use std::cell::Cell;
   struct Counter { n: Cell<u32> }
   impl Counter {
       fn bump(&self) { self.n.set(self.n.get() + 1); }
   }
   ```

NEVER promote a binding to `Arc<Mutex<T>>` just to fix E0596 in a single-threaded path. Use `Cell` or `RefCell`, or add `mut`. Over-engineering hides intent.

---

## E0499: cannot borrow as mutable more than once at a time

**Official summary (verbatim):** *"A variable was borrowed as mutable more than once."* Source: `rustc_error_codes/E0499.md`.

### Root cause

Two `&mut` references to the same value overlap in time. Rust forbids this because mutable aliasing is unsound.

### Erroneous example

```rust
let mut i = 0;
let x = &mut i;
let a = &mut i;  // E0499: cannot borrow `i` as mutable more than once
x;
```

### Fix patterns

1. **Scope-tighten via NLL.** Finish using the first `&mut` before creating the second. Many naive cases vanish.
   ```rust
   let mut i = 0;
   { let x = &mut i; *x += 1; }  // first borrow ends here
   let a = &mut i;               // OK
   ```

2. **Split borrow across disjoint struct fields.** The compiler tracks paths; `&mut s.a` and `&mut s.b` are allowed when `a` and `b` are distinct fields.
   ```rust
   struct S { a: u32, b: u32 }
   let mut s = S { a: 0, b: 0 };
   let pa = &mut s.a;
   let pb = &mut s.b; // OK, disjoint paths
   *pa = 1; *pb = 2;
   ```

3. **Split borrow on a slice via `split_at_mut`** for two disjoint halves.
   ```rust
   let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
   let (left, right) = v.split_at_mut(2);
   left[0] = 10; right[0] = 30;
   ```

4. **Restructure ownership tree.** If the same `&mut` needs to flow into two consumers, hand it to one, finish, hand to the next. Sequence the work.

NEVER hold the first `&mut` longer than necessary to extend its lifetime past the conflict; that is the opposite direction. The fix is *shorter* borrows, not longer.

---

## E0500: closure requires unique access but it is already borrowed

**Official summary (verbatim):** *"A borrowed variable was used by a closure."* Source: `rustc_error_codes/E0500.md`.

### Root cause

A closure captures a value by unique (`&mut`) reference, but the same value is already borrowed (shared or mutable) elsewhere in scope.

### Erroneous example

```rust
fn you_know_nothing(jon_snow: &mut i32) {
    let nights_watch = &jon_snow;     // shared borrow
    let starks = || { *jon_snow = 3; }; // E0500: closure wants unique access
    println!("{nights_watch}");
}
```

### Fix patterns

1. **Drop the conflicting borrow before the closure is created (or first called).**
   ```rust
   fn you_know_nothing(jon_snow: &mut i32) {
       let nights_watch = &jon_snow;
       println!("{nights_watch}");   // borrow ends
       let starks = || { *jon_snow = 3; };
       starks();
   }
   ```

2. **`move` keyword to force capture by value.** Use when the closure should own the captured data and no outer borrow is needed.
   ```rust
   let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
   let print_v = move || println!("{v:?}");
   ```
   `move` does not fix overlapping borrow of the outer variable; it sidesteps the problem by transferring ownership.

3. **Restructure capture set.** Capture only the field you need, not the whole struct. Closures see the path you actually use.
   ```rust
   struct S { a: i32, b: i32 }
   let mut s = S { a: 0, b: 0 };
   let r_b = &s.b;             // disjoint capture
   let mut f = || s.a += 1;    // OK, captures only s.a
   f();
   println!("{r_b}");
   ```

4. **Clone for genuinely independent users.** If a closure must run later with a snapshot of the value, clone before capturing.

NEVER pass `&mut` to a closure and then read the outer variable while the closure is live. The closure holds the unique reference until dropped.

---

## E0716: temporary value dropped while borrowed

**Official summary (verbatim):** *"A temporary value is being dropped while a borrow is still in active use."* Source: `rustc_error_codes/E0716.md`.

### Root cause

`&expr` where `expr` is a function call, arithmetic result, or other rvalue creates an **anonymous temporary**. The temporary lives only until the end of the enclosing statement (the rules are in the Reference under "Temporary lifetimes"). If a borrow of that temporary tries to outlive the statement, E0716 fires.

### Erroneous example

```rust
fn foo() -> i32 { 22 }
fn bar(x: &i32) -> &i32 { x }
let p = bar(&foo());  // &foo() creates a temporary that dies after this statement
let q = *p;           // E0716: temporary dropped while borrowed
```

### Fix patterns

1. **`let`-bind the temporary** to extend its lifetime to the end of the enclosing block.
   ```rust
   let value = foo();      // owns the i32 for the whole block
   let p = bar(&value);
   let q = *p;             // OK
   ```

2. **`let tmp = &expr;`** also extends the temporary's lifetime to the enclosing block via temporary-lifetime-extension rules.
   ```rust
   let p = &foo();  // temporary extended to block scope
   let q = *p;
   ```

3. **Restructure so the call result is consumed within the same statement** if you do not need it later.
   ```rust
   println!("{}", bar(&foo()));  // single statement, no later use of p
   ```

NEVER `Box::leak(Box::new(expr))` to silence E0716. That leaks memory permanently. Use `let`-binding.

---

## Cross-cutting fix patterns

These apply to multiple error codes. Try in this order when the specific section above does not match:

| Pattern | Use when |
|---|---|
| Borrow instead of move | E0382 root pattern. Function reads or writes but does not consume. |
| Introduce intermediate binding | E0502 + E0716. Extracts a value out of a borrow so the borrow can end. |
| Scope-tighten via NLL | E0502 + E0499 + E0500. The borrow ends at last use; restructure so the second access is past that point. |
| Split borrow (struct fields or `split_at_mut`) | E0499 across disjoint paths. |
| `mem::take` / `mem::replace` | E0382 when you need ownership but cannot move. |
| Interior mutability (`Cell` / `RefCell`) | E0596 when receiver must stay `&self`. |
| `move` closure | E0500 when closure should own the data. |
| `let`-bind to extend temporary | E0716 verbatim fix. |
| `.clone()` | Last resort. ONLY when the alternatives fail or the value is small / cheap. |

---

## Anti-patterns (never do this)

See `references/anti-patterns.md` for full WHY explanations. Headlines:

1. **Cloning everything to silence E0382.** Doubles heap cost. Hides the real ownership question.
2. **`RefCell` to bypass E0502 / E0499.** Pushes a compile-time error into a runtime panic.
3. **`Arc<Mutex<T>>` to fix E0596 in single-threaded code.** Adds atomic cost for zero benefit.
4. **`Box::leak` to extend a temporary in E0716.** Permanent memory leak.
5. **`unsafe` + raw pointer to dodge the borrow checker.** Undefined behavior risk; soundness now on you.
6. **Holding a `MutexGuard` past its needed scope** to silence E0499. Extends critical section, hurts contention.
