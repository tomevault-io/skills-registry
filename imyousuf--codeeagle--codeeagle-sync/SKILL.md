# CodeEagle Sync

Sync the CodeEagle knowledge graph with the latest code changes.

## Usage

Use the Bash tool to run:
```
codeeagle sync
```

For a full re-index (ignoring incremental state):
```
codeeagle sync --full
```

To export the graph after syncing:
```
codeeagle sync --export
```

## Prerequisites
- CodeEagle must be installed and on PATH
- Project must be initialized (`codeeagle init`)

To run linker phases on an existing graph without re-indexing:
```
codeeagle backpop           # new phases only (implements + tests)
codeeagle backpop --all     # all 7 linker phases
```

## Notes
- By default performs a diff-aware incremental sync (only processes changed files)
- Use `--full` to rebuild the entire knowledge graph from scratch
- Use `--export` to export the graph data after syncing
- Sync automatically runs the cross-service linker (7 phases: services, endpoints, API calls, dependencies, imports, implements, tests)
- Use `backpop` to run linker phases without re-indexing (useful after adding new linker features)
