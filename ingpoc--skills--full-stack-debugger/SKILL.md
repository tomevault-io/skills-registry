name: full-stack-debugger
description: This skill should be used when debugging full-stack issues that span UI, backend, and database layers. It provides a systematic workflow to detect errors, analyze root causes, apply fixes iteratively, and verify solutions through automated server restarts and browser-based testing. Ideal for scenarios like failing schedulers, import errors, database issues, or API payload problems where issues originate in backend code but manifest in the UI. Use when this capability is needed.

# Full Stack Debugger

## Overview

The Full Stack Debugger enables systematic debugging of issues across the entire application stack (UI/Frontend, Backend/API, Database/State). It combines browser testing, log analysis, code examination, and automated server restart/verification to iteratively identify and fix issues one at a time until the system is fully operational.

This skill uses a proven workflow: **Detection → Analysis → Fix → Restart → Verification → Iteration** to systematically resolve issues that developers encounter during development and testing.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when observing:
- Error states in the UI (dashboard, buttons failing, status showing errors)
- Repeated failures in backend logs (task execution failures, import errors, database errors)
- Unexpected database state (rows showing failed status when they should succeed)
- API endpoints returning errors or unexpected responses
- Services failing to initialize or process tasks
- Cascading failures across multiple components

## Debugging Workflow

### Phase 1: Detection

Detect errors from multiple sources:

**Browser UI Detection:**
- Navigate to the affected page/feature in the browser
- Check for error messages, red warning states, or disabled functionality
- Read console error messages using DevTools
- Note the specific UI state and what action triggered the error

**Backend Log Detection:**
- Query recent error logs using `tail -200 /path/to/logs/errors.log`
- Search for error patterns related to the issue using `grep`
- Note error timestamps, error messages, and stack traces
- Look for repeated errors (indicates systemic issue)

**Database State Detection:**
- Query the database directly using sqlite3
- Check status of recent tasks, transactions, or records
- Look for failed, incomplete, or error states
- Note which records are affected and what their states are

**Example:** When debugging a scheduler failure:
1. Navigate to System Health dashboard
2. Observe scheduler showing "0 done" or "X failed"
3. Check `/logs/errors.log` for error messages
4. Query `queue_tasks` table to see failed task records

### Phase 2: Analysis

Analyze root causes by reading code and logs:

**Code Analysis:**
- Read the error file/module indicated in error stack traces
- Check imports - look for missing `from X import Y` statements
- Check class names - verify instantiation matches actual class names
- Look for syntax errors - unmatched quotes, unclosed parentheses
- Check function signatures - ensure payloads match expected parameters
- Read reference documentation (`references/common_errors.md`) for error patterns

**Log Analysis:**
- Extract error messages from logs
- Look for patterns like `'optional'` (missing import), `unterminated string` (syntax error), `'attribute'` (wrong class name)
- Trace error propagation backward to find the originating issue
- Check timestamps - multiple errors at same time indicate batch failure

**API/Payload Analysis:**
- Check what payload the API is sending to task handlers
- Read the task handler code to see what fields it expects
- Compare actual payload vs expected payload
- Look for missing required fields

**Example:** When debugging "name 'Optional' is not defined":
1. Find the file mentioned in error (`analysis_executor.py`)
2. Read the imports section
3. Notice `Optional` is used but not imported
4. Check line 14: `from typing import Dict, List, Any` - missing `Optional`
5. Fix: Add `Optional` to the import statement

### Phase 3: Fix (One Issue at a Time)

Apply fixes one issue per iteration:

**Before Fixing:**
- Verify this is the first/next issue to fix
- Read the relevant code section carefully
- Use the fix patterns from `references/fix_templates.md`

**Common Fix Patterns:**
- **Missing imports:** Add to import statement (e.g., `from typing import Optional`)
- **Wrong class name:** Update import and instantiation to match actual class
- **Missing docstring quotes:** Add opening `"""` to docstring
- **Wrong payload fields:** Add missing required fields to payload dictionary
- **Syntax errors:** Fix unmatched quotes, parentheses, brackets

**After Fixing:**
- Read back the changed code to verify syntax
- Check the edit was correct (line numbers, indentation)
- Only fix ONE issue, even if multiple exist - don't cascade fixes
- Document what was changed in a clear comment

**Example Fix:**
```python
# BEFORE
from typing import Dict, List, Any

# AFTER
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional
```

### Phase 4: Restart (Automated)

Restart the backend server after each fix:

```bash
# Kill existing processes
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null

# Clear Python bytecode cache
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete 2>/dev/null

# Restart backend
sleep 3 && python -m src.main --command web > /tmp/backend_restart.log 2>&1 &
sleep 10  # Wait for startup

# Verify health
curl -m 5 http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

### Phase 5: Verification

Verify the fix worked through multiple checks:

**Health Check:**
- Call `/api/health` endpoint
- Verify `"status": "healthy"`
- If still failing, check logs for new errors

**Browser Verification:**
- Navigate to the affected UI page
- Trigger the action that previously failed
- Verify the error is gone
- Check for new errors in console

**Database Verification:**
- Query the affected records/tasks
- Verify status changed from failed/error to success/completed
- Check that metrics updated (e.g., scheduler shows "1 done" instead of "0 done")

**Log Verification:**
- Check recent logs for the same error
- Verify no new errors appeared
- Look for success messages or "completed" status

**Example:**
- Scheduler should show "1 done" instead of "0 done"
- Task record should show status="completed" instead of "failed"
- No error messages in logs
- WebSocket shows healthy status in UI

### Phase 6: Iteration

If issues remain, repeat the cycle:

1. **Continue if more issues exist:**
   - Check logs for remaining errors
   - If yes, return to Phase 2 (Analysis)
   - Fix the next issue (Phase 3)
   - Restart (Phase 4)
   - Verify (Phase 5)

2. **Stop when all issues fixed:**
   - All schedulers show completed execution counts
   - UI shows no error states
   - Logs show no error patterns
   - Tasks/records show success status
   - Full verification complete

## Common Error Patterns

See `references/common_errors.md` for patterns to recognize:
- Python syntax errors (unterminated strings, missing quotes)
- Import errors (`name 'X' is not defined`, `cannot import name 'Y'`)
- Class/attribute errors (`'dict' object has no attribute 'symbol'`)
- Type errors (passing wrong data type)
- Payload/configuration errors (missing required fields)

## Fix Templates

See `references/fix_templates.md` for ready-to-use fix patterns:
- How to add missing imports
- How to fix class name mismatches
- How to fix docstring syntax
- How to add missing payload fields
- How to fix type errors

## Tools Used

- **Playwright Browser Tools:** Navigate UI, verify changes
- **Read/Grep Tools:** Examine code and logs
- **Bash:** Server restart, cache clearing, health checks
- **Edit Tool:** Apply code fixes
- **Database Queries:** Verify task/record state

**Example debugging workflow**:
```python
# 1. Detect errors (MCP instead of tail/grep)
mcp__robo-trader-dev__analyze_logs(patterns=["ERROR", "TIMEOUT"], time_window="1h")

# 2. Check system health (MCP instead of curl loops)
mcp__robo-trader-dev__check_system_health(components=["database", "queues", "api_endpoints"])

# 3. Diagnose specific issue (MCP instead of sqlite3 + code reading)
mcp__robo-trader-dev__diagnose_database_locks(time_window="24h", include_code_references=True)

# 4. Get fix suggestions (MCP instead of manual pattern matching)
mcp__robo-trader-dev__suggest_fix(error_message="name 'Optional' is not defined", context_file="src/services/analyzer.py")
```

**Integration with robo-trader architecture**:
- Queue operations: Use `queue_status` to monitor PORTFOLIO_SYNC, DATA_FETCHER, AI_ANALYSIS
- Coordinator debugging: Use `coordinator_status` for BroadcastCoordinator, AIChatCoordinator init issues
- Database access: Use `query_portfolio` or `diagnose_database_locks` instead of direct sqlite3 connections

## Key Principles

1. **One issue at a time** - Fix one problem per iteration to prevent cascading failures
2. **Verify immediately** - Always restart and verify after each fix
3. **Multi-layer detection** - Check UI, logs, and database for clues
4. **Iterative refinement** - Continue until all issues resolved
5. **Automated restart** - Always use clean restart (kill + cache clear + restart)
6. **Browser verification** - Always test in actual UI, not just logs
