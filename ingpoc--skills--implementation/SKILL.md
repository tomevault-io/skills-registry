# Implementation

Feature development for IMPLEMENT state.

## When to Load

- State: IMPLEMENT
- Condition: Pending feature exists in feature-list.json

## Core Workflow

| Step | Action | Command/Tool |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Get feature | `.claude/scripts/get-current-feature.sh` |
| 2 | **BLOCKING:** Check for templates | `ls .claude/scripts/TEMPLATE-*.sh 2>/dev/null` |
| 3 | Analyze codebase | `mcp__token-efficient__execute_code` |
| 4 | Query past decisions | `context_query_traces(query=feature_description)` |
| 5 | **Implement feature** | See Step 5 detailed workflow below |
| 6 | Commit (ONLY after tests pass) | `.claude/scripts/feature-commit.sh feat-ID "desc"` |
| 7 | Mark complete | `.claude/scripts/mark-feature-complete.sh feat-ID implemented` |
| 8 | **Session introspection** | Detect issues → Update scripts → Commit separately |

## Step 2: TEMPLATE- Gate (Critical)

**If `TEMPLATE-*.sh` files exist → STOP**

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Read script purposes | `cat .claude/scripts/README.md` |
| Customize script | Edit for your project (ports, paths, commands) |
| Rename to activate | `mv TEMPLATE-script.sh script.sh` |
| Test script | Run and verify output |
| Commit | `git add .claude/scripts/ && git commit` |

**Only proceed when:** `ls .claude/scripts/TEMPLATE-*.sh` returns nothing

See `references/template-scripts.md` for detailed customization guide.

## Step 5: Feature Implementation Sub-Workflow (CRITICAL)

**NEVER commit until ALL verification steps pass.**

| Sub-step | Action | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 5a | Write code | Follow project patterns, add types/error handling |
| 5b | Write tests | Unit tests (happy paths, error cases, edge cases) |
| 5c | **Verify ALL pass** | Run verification commands in order |
| 5d | Manual testing | Test functionality if automated tests unclear |

### 5c: Verification Commands (Run in Order)

Stop at first failure. Fix issue, then restart from top.

| Command | Purpose | Must Pass |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Type check | Verify types (TS/typed languages) | ✅ Exit code 0 |
| Run tests | All unit/integration tests | ✅ Exit code 0 |
| Build | Project builds successfully | ✅ Exit code 0 |
| Health check | Servers/services healthy | ✅ Exit code 0 |

**Common commands by project type:**

| Project Type | Type Check | Run Tests | Build |
|--------------|------------|-----------|-------|
| TypeScript/Node | `pnpm typecheck` | `pnpm test` | `pnpm build` |
| Python | `mypy .` | `pytest` | `python -m build` |
| Go | `go vet ./...` | `go test ./...` | `go build` |
| Rust | `cargo check` | `cargo test` | `cargo build` |

**Golden Rule:** `git commit` ONLY when all commands exit with code 0.

### 5d: Manual Testing (When Needed)

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| API endpoints | Test with curl/Postman |
| Web UI | Test in browser |
| CLI tool | Run with sample inputs |
| Automated tests timeout/fail | Verify functionality works manually |

**Purpose:** Confirm implementation works before committing.

## Token-Efficient Analysis (Step 3)

| Task | Tool | Savings |
|------|------|---------|
| Code execution | `mcp__token-efficient__execute_code` | 98% |
| Log parsing | `mcp__token-efficient__process_logs` | 95% |
| Large datasets | `mcp__token-efficient__process_csv` | 99% |

**Rule:** Never load raw logs/code into context.

## Exit Criteria (All Must Pass)

- [ ] No `TEMPLATE-*.sh` files remain
- [ ] Code written with proper types/error handling
- [ ] Tests written (unit tests for happy paths, errors, edge cases)
- [ ] **ALL verification commands pass (exit code 0)**
  - [ ] Type check passes
  - [ ] All tests pass
  - [ ] Build succeeds
  - [ ] Health check passes (if applicable)
- [ ] Manual testing confirms functionality (if needed)
- [ ] Committed with feature ID in message
- [ ] feature-list.json status updated
- [ ] **Session introspection complete** (Step 8)
  - [ ] Issues identified and documented
  - [ ] Scripts updated (if issues found)
  - [ ] Script updates committed separately (chore:)

**NEVER skip verification. Commit only after ALL checks pass.**

## Post-Implementation: Store Learnings

After successful feature completion, store key decisions in context-graph:

| Category | What to Store |
|----------|---------------|
| architecture | Design patterns, component reuse, state management |
| api | Endpoint patterns, error handling, response formats |
| testing | Test strategies, mock patterns, edge cases discovered |
| deployment | Build steps, server restart requirements, configuration |

**Example:**

```
context_store_trace(
  decision="Used StateStore for session management with 30min TTL",
  category="architecture",
  outcome="success",
  feature_id="FEATURE-001"
)
```

**Purpose:** Future features can query past decisions for consistency.

## Step 8: Session Introspection & Script Updates

**Purpose:** Create continuous improvement feedback loop. Detect friction points and update scripts to prevent future issues.

### When to Run

- After feature marked complete
- After learnings stored in context-graph
- Before session ends

### Detection Patterns

| Issue Pattern | Root Cause | Script Update |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| Manual rebuilds | `node dist/index.js` vs `tsx watch` | restart-servers.sh: Use tsx watch |
| Tests not found | Vitest pattern missing nested packages | vitest.config.ts: Add `packages/*/*/src/**/*.test.ts` |
| Route collisions | Dynamic routes before static routes | Add comments to templates |
| Missing API tests | New endpoints not in run-tests.sh | run-tests.sh: Add endpoint checks |
| Repeated type errors | Missing type definitions | Update template imports |
| Libsodium/ESM issues | Direct imports failing | Document workaround in templates |

### Detection Methods

| Method | What to Check | Tool |
|--------|---------------|------|
| Command history | Repeated commands | `history \| grep -E "(build|restart|test)"` |
| Manual edits | Files changed outside feature | `git diff --stat` |
| Error patterns | Systemic issues | Session error logs |
| Frequency analysis | Commands run 3+ times | Count occurrences |

### Output Format

When issues detected:

```
🔧 Session Issues Detected:
- [Issue 1]: [Impact]
- [Issue 2]: [Impact]

📝 Recommended Script Updates:
- [script-name]: [Update description] (BEFORE → AFTER)

Apply updates? (y/n)
```

### Implementation Guidelines

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **NON-BLOCKING** | User can skip if unsure |
| **Explain WHY** | Context for the update |
| **Show BEFORE/AFTER** | Clear comparison |
| **Commit separately** | `chore:` prefix, not `feat:` |
| **Store in context-graph** | Future sessions can learn |

### Commit Format

```bash
git add .claude/scripts/
git commit -m "chore: Update scripts based on [FEATURE-ID] learnings

- [script-1]: [update description]
- [script-2]: [update description]

Prevents: [issue description]"
```

### Example from SDK-BUYER-CART-003

**Issues Detected:**

- Rebuilt api-server 5+ times manually
- Tests in nested packages not discovered
- New endpoints (cart, checkout) untested

**Updates Applied:**

1. `restart-servers.sh`: Use `tsx watch` for hot-reload
2. `vitest.config.ts`: Added `packages/*/*/src/**/*.test.ts`
3. `run-tests.sh`: Added POST /api/cart, PUT /api/cart/buyer, POST /api/checkout

**Result:** Future sessions have hot-reload, all tests discovered, endpoints validated

### Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Manual work reduced | <10% of session time |
| Repeated issues | 0 in next 3 sessions |
| Script coverage | All common patterns automated |
| Learnings codified | Every feature updates at least 1 script |

## Scripts Reference

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `get-current-feature.sh` | Extract next pending feature |
| `health-check.sh` | Verify implementation health |
| `feature-commit.sh` | Commit with feature ID |
| `mark-feature-complete.sh` | Update feature status |
| `run-tests.sh` | Run project tests |

### If Scripts Don't Exist

**When project scripts are missing** → Create minimal versions:

| Script | Minimal Template |
|--------|------------------|
| get-current-feature.sh | `jq '.features[] | select(.status=="pending")' feature-list.json | head -1` |
| feature-commit.sh | `git commit -m "feat: $1 $2"` |
| mark-feature-complete.sh | `jq --arg id "$1" '.features[] | select(.id==$id) | .status="$2"' feature-list.json` |
| run-tests.sh | Project test command (see verification table) |
