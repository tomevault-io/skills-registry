# Testing

Comprehensive testing for TEST state.

## Instructions

1. Run unit tests: `scripts/run-unit-tests.sh`
2. Run API tests: `scripts/run-api-tests.sh`
3. Run browser tests (if UI): via Claude-in-Chrome MCP
4. Verify database (if data): `scripts/verify-database.sh`
5. Collect evidence: `scripts/collect-evidence.sh`
6. Report results (code verified, not judged)

## Exit Criteria (Code Verified)

```bash
# All must return exit code 0
scripts/run-unit-tests.sh
scripts/run-api-tests.sh
[ -f "/tmp/test-evidence/results.json" ]
jq '.all_passed == true' /tmp/test-evidence/results.json
```
