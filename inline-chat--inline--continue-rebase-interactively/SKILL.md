# Goal
Help continue an in-progress rebase (or similar conflict cleanup from a merge or stash apply) by iterating through conflicts, summarizing each conflict, and presenting 3 resolution options (keep A, keep B, keep both with a surgical refactor). Mark the best option as recommended, wait for user confirmation, apply the choice, and continue until the operation completes.

# Preconditions
- A git rebase is in progress and has conflicts.
- Never read .env files or run commands that print their contents.
- Always ask before any destructive command (git restore, rm, reset, etc.).

# Workflow

1) Detect conflict state and conflicts
- Run:
  - `git status -sb`
  - `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`
- If no conflicts are listed, state that and suggest the appropriate next command based on state:
  - Rebase: `git rebase --continue`
  - Merge: `git merge --continue` (or commit if already staged)
  - Stash apply/pop: `git stash` (resolve + add + continue/commit as needed)

2) For each conflicted file (one at a time)
- Open the file and extract the conflict region(s).
- Present a short “gist” summary (what each side changes, in plain language).
- If the conflict is trivial (whitespace-only, formatting, comment-only, or import ordering), say so explicitly.
- Offer exactly 3 options:
  - **Option A**: keep “A” side (ours)
  - **Option B**: keep “B” side (theirs)
  - **Option C**: keep both with a surgical refactor (briefly describe how)
- Mark one option as **Recommended** and explain why, briefly. For trivial conflicts, recommend the cleanest auto-resolve and mention it can be applied quickly if approved.
- Ask the user to choose A/B/C.
- For the "keep both" approach, make sure you understand in git diffs, some part of the code that should've been duplicated may have been detected as one and you need to manually add it again in another part that was collapsed by git. 

3) Apply the chosen resolution
- Implement the selected option by editing the file and removing conflict markers.
- Re-check for remaining conflict markers in that file.
- Stage the file with `git add <file>`.
- Ask to continue to the next conflict.

4) Continue the rebase
- When all conflicts are resolved and staged, run `git rebase --continue`.
- If rebase pauses again, return to step 1.
- If rebase completes, report success and show `git status -sb`.

# Notes
- Prefer minimal edits; keep changes localized to conflict regions.
- If conflicts are complex or ambiguous, ask a clarifying question before recommending.
- Avoid automated bulk resolutions; keep it interactive and explicit.
- Do not run heavy tests unless requested. Suggest a focused test if relevant.

# Output Style
- For each conflict, output:
  - File path
  - Gist of A vs B
  - Options A/B/C with one **Recommended**
  - A short question: “Pick A/B/C?”
