# Affiliate Compliance Check

Automated and manual workflows for ensuring affiliate marketing content complies with FTC guidelines and follows ethical best practices.

## When to Use

- Audit content for FTC disclosure compliance
- Verify affiliate links are properly tracked
- Check for broken or missing affiliate links
- Prepare content for publication review

## Quick Compliance Check

```bash
# Find files with affiliate links
grep -r -l -E "(affiliate|aff\.|&id=|\?ref=)" \
  copywriting/ landing_pages/ --include="*.md" --include="*.html"

# Check for disclosures
for file in $(grep -r -l -E "(affiliate|aff\.)" copywriting/ --include="*.md"); do
  if ! grep -q -i "disclosure" "$file"; then
    echo "❌ Missing disclosure: $file"
  fi
done
```

## FTC Requirements
