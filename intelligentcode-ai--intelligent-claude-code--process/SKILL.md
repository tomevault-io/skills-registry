# Development Process

**AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION.** This process runs automatically. It only pauses when human input is genuinely required.

## Branch Workflow (CRITICAL)

```
main     ← STABLE ONLY (releases from dev)
  ↑
dev      ← INTEGRATION (all work merges here first)
  ↑
feature/* ← WHERE WORK HAPPENS
```

**ALL changes go to dev first. Main is ALWAYS stable.**

| Action | Target Branch |
|--------|---------------|
| Feature work | PR to `dev` |
| Bug fixes | PR to `dev` |
| Releases | PR from `dev` to `main` |

## Autonomous Principles

1. **Fix issues automatically** - Don't ask permission for obvious fixes
2. **Implement safe improvements automatically** - Low effort + safe = just do it
3. **Loop until clean** - Keep fixing until tests pass and no findings
4. **Only pause for genuine decisions** - Ambiguity, architecture, risk
5. **PR to dev by default** - Never PR to main unless releasing

```

## Phase 1: Development (AUTONOMOUS)

### Step 1.0: Memory Check (AUTOMATIC)
```
BEFORE implementing, search memory:
  memory search: "relevant keywords"

  (CLI fallback, if you prefer commands: `node ./.claude/skills/memory/cli.js search "relevant keywords"`
   for project installs, or `node ~/.claude/skills/memory/cli.js search "relevant keywords"` for user installs.)

IF similar problem solved before:
  - Review the solution
  - Apply or adapt it
  - Skip re-solving known problems

This step is SILENT - no user notification needed.
```

### Step 1.1: Implement
```
Implement feature/fix
```

### Step 1.2: Test Loop
```
Run tests
IF tests fail:
    Analyze failure
    Fix automatically if clear
    GOTO Step 1.2
IF tests pass:
    Continue to Step 1.3
```

### Step 1.3: Review + Auto-Fix
```
Run reviewer skill
- Finds: logic errors, regressions, security issues, file placement
- FIXES AUTOMATICALLY (don't ask permission)

IF fixes made:
    GOTO Step 1.2 (re-test)
IF needs human decision:
    PAUSE - present options, wait for input
IF clean:
    Continue to Step 1.4
```

### Step 1.4: Suggest + Auto-Implement
```
Run suggest skill
- Identifies improvements
- AUTO-IMPLEMENTS safe ones (low effort, no behavior change)
- PRESENTS risky ones to user

IF auto-implemented:
    GOTO Step 1.2 (re-test)
IF needs human decision:
    PAUSE - present suggestions, wait for input
    User chooses: implement some/all/none
    IF implementing: GOTO Step 1.2
IF clean or user says proceed:
    Continue to Phase 2 or 3
```

### Step 1.5: Memory Save (AUTOMATIC)
```
IF key decision was made (architecture, pattern, fix):
  Remember:
  - Title: ...
  - Summary: ...
  - Category: architecture|implementation|issues|patterns
  - Importance: high|medium|low

  (CLI fallback: `node ./.claude/skills/memory/cli.js write --title "..." --summary "..." --category "..." --importance "..."`.)

This step is SILENT - auto-saves significant decisions.
```

**Exit:** Tests pass, no review findings, suggestions addressed

## Phase 2: Deployment (AUTONOMOUS)

Skip if no deployment required.

### Step 2.1: Deploy
```
Deploy to target environment
```

### Step 2.2: Test Loop
```
Run deployment tests
IF fail:
    Analyze and fix if clear
    GOTO Step 2.1
```

### Step 2.3: Review + Auto-Fix
```
Run reviewer skill
FIXES AUTOMATICALLY
IF fixes made: GOTO Step 2.2
```

### Step 2.4: Commit
```
Run commit-pr skill
Ensure git-privacy rules followed
```

**Exit:** Deployment tests pass, no findings, committed

## Phase 3: Pull Request (to dev)

**PRs go to `dev` branch, NOT `main`.**

### Step 3.1: Create PR to dev
```
Run commit-pr skill
MUST use: gh pr create --base dev
NEVER: gh pr create --base main (unless releasing)
```

### Step 3.2: Review + Auto-Fix (in temp folder)
```
TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
cd "$TEMP_DIR"

# gh pr checkout requires an existing git clone. Clone first:
gh repo clone OWNER/REPO repo
cd repo
gh pr checkout <PR-number>

Run reviewer skill (post-PR stage)
- Run project linters (Ansible, HELM, etc.)
- FIXES AUTOMATICALLY
- Push fixes to PR branch

IF fixes made: GOTO Step 3.2 (re-review)
IF needs human: PAUSE
IF clean: Continue
```

**Required behavior (closed-loop):**
- Stage 3 MUST be executed by a dedicated reviewer subagent (preferred: `@Reviewer` via Task tool).
- Reviewer Stage 3 MUST loop until the PR is clean:
  - If findings exist: fix + push commits to the PR branch, then restart Stage 3 in a fresh temp checkout.
  - When clean: post `ICC-REVIEW-RECEIPT` with `Findings: 0` and `NO FINDINGS` for the current head SHA.
  - Optional GitHub approvals (GitHub-style approvals mode):
    - Default is self-review-and-merge: **GitHub required approvals may remain at 0**, while ICC Stage 3 receipt remains
      the required review gate.
    - If `workflow.require_github_approval=true`, the reviewer subagent should also try to add a GitHub approval using
      `gh pr review <PR-number> --approve ...` (skip if already approved).
      - If PR author == current authenticated `gh` user: GitHub forbids approving your own PR (server-side rule). Skip.
        If repo rules require approvals, a second GitHub identity/bot is required for approvals.

### Step 3.3: Suggest + Auto-Implement
```
Run suggest skill on full PR diff
- AUTO-IMPLEMENTS safe improvements
- Push to PR branch
- PRESENTS risky ones to user

IF auto-implemented: GOTO Step 3.2 (re-review)
IF needs human: PAUSE, wait for decision
IF clean or user says proceed: Continue
```

### Step 3.4: Merge Approval (Default: Pause, Optional Auto-Merge)
Default behavior:
```
WAIT for explicit user approval
DO NOT merge without: "merge", "approve", "LGTM", or similar
```

Optional auto-merge (Skills-level standing approval):
- If `workflow.auto_merge=true` in the current AgentTask/workflow context
- AND the PR targets `dev`
- AND the reviewer Stage 3 ICC-REVIEW receipt exists for the current head SHA (PASS)
- AND the receipt includes `Findings: 0` and `NO FINDINGS`
- AND checks are green

Then the agent MAY proceed to merge without an additional chat approval.

**Never auto-merge to `main`** unless performing an explicitly requested release workflow.

**Exit:** No findings, suggestions addressed, user approved, merged to dev

## Phase 4: Release (dev → main)

**Only when user explicitly requests a release.**

### Step 4.1: Verify dev is stable
```
Ensure dev branch:
- All tests pass
- No pending critical issues
- User confirms ready for release
```

### Step 4.2: Create Release PR
```
gh pr create --base main --title "release: vX.Y.Z"
Include release notes and changelog
```

### Step 4.3: Await Release Approval
```
WAIT for explicit user approval
User must say "release", "merge to main", or similar
```

### Step 4.4: Tag and Publish
```
After merge to main:
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
gh release create vX.Y.Z
```

**Exit:** Released to main, tagged, published

## Quality Gates (BLOCKING)

**These gates are MANDATORY. You CANNOT proceed without passing them.**

| Gate | Requirement | Blocked Actions |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Pre-commit | Tests pass + reviewer skill clean | `git commit`, `git push` |
| Pre-deploy | Tests pass + reviewer skill clean | Deploy to production |
| Pre-merge | reviewer Stage 3 PASS receipt + checks green + user approval | `gh pr merge` |

### Gate Enforcement

```
IF attempting commit/push/PR without running reviewer skill:
  STOP - You are violating the process
  GO BACK to Step 1.3 (Review + Auto-Fix)
  DO NOT proceed until reviewer skill passes
```

**Skipping review is a process violation, not a shortcut.**

## When to Pause

**PAUSE for:**
- Architectural decisions affecting multiple components
- Ambiguous requirements needing clarification
- Multiple valid approaches with trade-offs
- High-risk changes that could break things
- **Merge approval** (always)

**DO NOT pause for:**
- Fixing typos, formatting, naming
- Adding missing error handling
- Fixing security vulnerabilities
- Moving misplaced files
- Removing unused code
- Extracting duplicated code
- Adding null checks

## Commands

**Start (runs autonomously):**
```
process skill
```

**Force pause at every step (L1 mode):**
```
process skill with L1 autonomy
```

**Check status:**
```
Where am I in the process?
```
