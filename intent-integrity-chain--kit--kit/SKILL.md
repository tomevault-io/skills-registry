# Intent Integrity Kit Tasks to Issues

Process steps in order. Do not skip ahead.

Convert existing tasks into dependency-ordered GitHub issues for project tracking.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

> **Platform note**: All `bash` commands have a PowerShell equivalent — replace `bash <script>.sh` with `pwsh <script>.ps1` and convert flags to `-PascalCase` form (e.g. `--phase 08 --json` → `-Phase 08 -Json`).

## Prerequisites Check

1. Run prerequisites check:
   ```bash
   bash .tessl/plugins/tessl-labs/intent-integrity-kit/skills/iikit-core/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --phase 08 --json
   ```
   Windows: `pwsh .tessl/plugins/tessl-labs/intent-integrity-kit/skills/iikit-core/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Phase 08 -Json`

2. Parse JSON for `FEATURE_DIR` and `AVAILABLE_DOCS`. Extract path to **tasks.md**.
3. If JSON contains `needs_selection: true`: present the `features` array as a numbered table (name and stage columns). Follow the options presentation pattern in [conversation-guide.md](../iikit-core/references/conversation-guide.md). After user selects, run:
   ```bash
   bash .tessl/plugins/tessl-labs/intent-integrity-kit/skills/iikit-core/scripts/bash/set-active-feature.sh --json <selection>
   ```
   Windows: `pwsh .tessl/plugins/tessl-labs/intent-integrity-kit/skills/iikit-core/scripts/powershell/set-active-feature.ps1 -Json <selection>`

   Then re-run the prerequisites check (item 1 of this section).

## GitHub Remote Validation

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

**CRITICAL**: Only proceed if the configured remote is a GitHub remote (SSH or HTTPS form). Otherwise ERROR.

## Step 1 — Parse tasks.md

Extract: Task IDs, descriptions, phase groupings, parallel markers [P], user story labels [USn], dependencies.

Proceed immediately to Step 2.



## Step 2 — Prepare Labels and Title Format

**Title format**: `[FeatureID/TaskID] [Story] Description` — feature-id extracted from `FEATURE_DIR` (e.g. `001-user-auth`).

**Body**: use template from [issue-body-template.md](references/issue-body-template.md). **Labels** (create if needed): `iikit`, `phase-N`, `us-N`, `parallel`.

Proceed immediately to Step 3.



## Step 3 — Create Issues (parallel)

Use the `Task` tool to dispatch issue creation in parallel — one subagent per chunk of tasks (split by phase or user story). Each subagent receives:
- The chunk of tasks to create issues for
- The feature-id, repo owner/name, and label set
- Instructions to create each issue on the project's tracker using whichever tool is available; pass the task title, body, and labels

```text
Example title: [001-user-auth/T012] [US1] Create User model
Example labels: iikit,phase-3,us-1
```

**CRITICAL**: Never create issues in repositories that don't match the project's configured remote. Verify before dispatching.

Collect all created issue numbers from subagents. Verify all returned successfully before proceeding. If some failed: report failures, continue with successful issues only.

Proceed immediately to Step 4.



## Step 4 — Link Dependencies

After all issues exist, edit bodies to add cross-references using `#NNN` syntax. Skip dependency links for any issues that failed to create.

Finish here.



## Report

Output: issues created (count + numbers), failures (count + details), link to repo issues list.

## Error Handling

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Not a GitHub remote | STOP with error |
| Issue creation fails | Report, continue with remaining issues |
| Partial failure | Link dependencies for successful issues only |

## Next Steps

```bash
bash .tessl/plugins/tessl-labs/intent-integrity-kit/skills/iikit-core/scripts/bash/next-step.sh --phase 08 --json
```

Parse the JSON and present:
1. `next_step` will be null (workflow complete)
2. If `alt_steps` non-empty: list as alternatives
3. Append dashboard link

If on a feature branch, offer to merge: **A)** `git checkout main && git merge <branch>`, **B)** `gh pr create`, or **C)** skip.

```
Issues exported! Review in GitHub, assign team members, add to project boards.
- Dashboard: file://$(pwd)/.specify/dashboard.html (resolve the path)
```
