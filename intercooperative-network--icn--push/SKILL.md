description: Resolve targets, run scoped local gates, then push. The only sanctioned path for pushing Rust changes. Use when this capability is needed.

Gated push with scoped verification. Resolves affected packages first, runs the minimum sufficient
gate set, classifies any lint failures by known remediation class, then pushes.

## Step 0 — Preflight

```bash
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
bash "${REPO_ROOT}/ops/scripts/drift-check.sh" 2>/dev/null | tail -3 || true
```

If drift-check reports FAIL → warn loudly. Pushing while agent tooling has drift means
CI may evaluate your PR with stale policy. Fix drift or acknowledge explicitly before continuing.

## Steps

1. **Confirm branch and status**:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   git status --short
   ```

2. **Resolve touched packages** to determine verification scope:
   ```bash
   # Files changed on this branch
   git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)..HEAD

   # Map to workspace package names (never guess)
   cargo metadata --no-deps --format-version 1 \
     | python3 -c "
   import sys, json
   md = json.load(sys.stdin)
   for p in md['packages']:
       root = p['manifest_path'].replace('/Cargo.toml','')
       print(f\"{p['name']:40s}  {root}\")
   " | sort
   ```

   Scope decision:
   - Changes in 1–3 packages → scoped commands (faster)
   - Changes include `icnd/src/main.rs`, `lifecycle.rs`, or cross multiple crate boundaries → workspace-wide

3. **Run format check** (always workspace-wide, fast):
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all --check
   ```

4. **Run clippy** (scoped if possible):
   ```bash
   # Scoped (preferred — must use --all-targets to match CI):
   cargo clippy -p <pkg1> -p <pkg2> --all-targets -- -D warnings

   # Workspace (when cross-cutting):
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
   ```

   On failure, classify before fixing (see `fix-rust-lints` for canonical patterns):
   - `field_reassign_with_default` → struct update syntax
   - `use of deprecated` in tests → replace with recommended API
   - Overflow/underflow in time math → use `checked_sub` / `checked_mul`

5. **Run tests** (unless `$ARGUMENTS` includes `--skip-test`):
   ```bash
   cargo test -p <pkg1> -p <pkg2>   # scoped
   cargo test --workspace            # workspace
   ```

6. **If any gate fails**: report lint class and canonical fix, do NOT push.

7. **If all gates pass**:
   ```bash
   git push                         # normal push
   git push -u origin <branch>      # first push (no upstream)
   git push --force-with-lease      # after rebase (if $ARGUMENTS includes --force-with-lease)
   ```

8. **Report**: pushed branch, commit SHA, scope used, gate results.

## Important

- Never push if fmt or clippy fails.
- `--skip-test` skips the test suite. fmt + clippy always run.
- A local `cargo clippy -p <crate>` pass does NOT guarantee `--workspace --all-targets` passes.
  Use `--all-targets` to match CI behavior.
- After a rebase, always re-run at minimum scoped clippy before force-pushing.
- Never guess package IDs. Use `cargo metadata` to confirm. See known confusions below.

## Known ICN package name confusions

| Human label | Correct `-p` argument |
|-------------|----------------------|
| "ledger" (crate) | `icn-ledger` |
| "ledger app" / "icn-ledger-app" | `icn-ledger-actor` (apps/ledger) |
| "obs" | `icn-obs` |
| "security" | `icn-security` |
| "compute" | `icn-compute` |
| "core" | `icn-core` |
| "daemon" / "icnd" | `icnd` (bin — triggers workspace-wide) |
| "governance app" | `icn-governance-actor` |
| "membership app" | `icn-membership-app` |
