# Image Fetcher Skill

This skill enables Claude to fetch and download images from the internet with support for multiple image formats and batch downloading capabilities.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests:
- Downloading images from specific URLs
- Fetching images from the web to embed in documents
- Saving images locally from internet sources
- Batch downloading multiple images
- Converting or processing images that need to be downloaded first

## Supported Image Formats

The skill automatically detects and handles these formats:
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- GIF
- WebP
- BMP
- SVG
- ICO
- TIFF/TIF

## Core Workflows

### Single Image Download

To download a single image from a URL:

```bash
python scripts/fetch_image.py <image_url> [output_directory] [filename]
```

**Parameters:**
- `image_url` (required): URL of the image to download
- `output_directory` (optional): Directory to save the image (defaults to current directory)
- `filename` (optional): Custom filename for the saved image (defaults to URL filename)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Basic download to current directory
python scripts/fetch_image.py https://example.com/photo.jpg

# Download to specific directory
python scripts/fetch_image.py https://example.com/photo.jpg ./downloads

# Download with custom filename
python scripts/fetch_image.py https://example.com/photo.jpg ./downloads myimage.jpg
```

### Batch Image Download

To download multiple images from a list of URLs:

```bash
python scripts/fetch_images_batch.py <urls_file> [output_directory]
```

**Input file formats:**
1. Text file with one URL per line
2. JSON file with array of URLs: `["url1", "url2", ...]`

**Examples:**
```bash
# Download from text file
python scripts/fetch_images_batch.py urls.txt

# Download to specific directory
python scripts/fetch_images_batch.py urls.json ./images

# Create a URL list on the fly
echo -e "https://example.com/img1.jpg\nhttps://example.com/img2.png" > urls.txt
python scripts/fetch_images_batch.py urls.txt ./downloads
```

The batch script creates a `fetch_results.json` file with detailed results for each download.

## Integration with Claude Workflow

### For Document Embedding

When fetching images to embed in documents (DOCX, PPTX, etc.):

1. Download the image to a temporary location
2. Use the returned file path to embed the image in the document
3. Clean up temporary files if needed

```bash
# Download image
python scripts/fetch_image.py https://example.com/chart.png /home/claude/temp

# The script outputs the full path which can be used for embedding
# Example output: /home/claude/temp/chart.png
```

### For Chat Display

When downloading images to display in chat:

1. Download to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` directory
2. Provide the user with a link to the downloaded image

```bash
python scripts/fetch_image.py https://example.com/image.jpg /mnt/user-data/outputs
```

### Search Integration

When combined with web search:

1. Search for images using web_search tool
2. Extract image URLs from search results
3. Use this skill to download the images

## Error Handling

The scripts handle common scenarios:
- Invalid URLs
- Network timeouts
- Unsupported formats
- Permission errors
- Missing directories (auto-created)

Failed downloads are reported with clear error messages.

## Output Information

Each successful download provides:
- Full path to saved file
- File size in KB
- Content-Type from server
- Success confirmation

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate URLs** before attempting download
2. **Use batch downloading** for multiple images to improve efficiency
3. **Specify output directory** to organize downloads properly
4. **Check file extensions** - the script auto-detects format from headers if URL lacks extension
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - inform users of any failed downloads

## Common Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Embedding web images in presentations**
```bash
# User: "Add this chart to my presentation: https://data.com/chart.png"
python scripts/fetch_image.py https://data.com/chart.png /home/claude/temp
# Then use the path to embed in PPTX
```

**Use Case 2: Creating image gallery from URLs**
```bash
# User: "Download these product images and save them"
# Create urls.txt with image URLs
python scripts/fetch_images_batch.py urls.txt /mnt/user-data/outputs/gallery
```

**Use Case 3: Logo download for branding**
```bash
# User: "Get the company logo from their website"
python scripts/fetch_image.py https://company.com/logo.svg /home/claude/assets logo.svg
```

## Technical Notes

- Uses `requests` library with appropriate headers to avoid being blocked
- Streams large files to handle memory efficiently
- 30-second timeout for each download
- Automatic content-type detection and extension mapping
- Creates output directories automatically if they don't exist
