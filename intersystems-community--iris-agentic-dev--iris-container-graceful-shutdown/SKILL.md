# IRIS Container Graceful Shutdown

## The Problem

`docker stop` sends SIGTERM then SIGKILL after the grace period. **IRIS does not trap SIGTERM in its default entrypoint.** Docker kills it. The WIJ (write image journal — IRIS's write buffer) is not flushed. On restart, IRIS runs journal recovery which takes 30-300 seconds. Uncommitted in-flight writes are lost.

**Symptom**: After `docker stop` + `docker start`, tables exist (schema survived) but rows are 0.

**This is silent** — no error, no warning, IRIS starts cleanly, data appears empty.

---

## Fix: Always Run `iris stop IRIS quietly` Before `docker stop`

```bash
docker exec <container> iris stop IRIS quietly
docker stop <container>
```

This flushes the WIJ, checkpoints globals, and marks the database clean. Next start is instant.

---

## docker-compose Pattern

```yaml
services:
  iris:
    image: intersystemsdc/iris-community:latest
    stop_grace_period: 60s    # Give docker stop 60s before SIGKILL
    # Note: stop_grace_period alone is NOT enough — IRIS doesn't trap SIGTERM.
    # You must also run 'iris stop IRIS quietly' before 'docker compose down'.
```

**Shutdown script** (create as `scripts/stop-iris.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
CONTAINER="${1:-iris}"
docker exec "$CONTAINER" iris stop IRIS quietly
docker stop "$CONTAINER"
```

---

## iris-devtester (v1.18.1+)

`IRISContainer.__exit__()` now calls `stop_gracefully()` automatically:

```python
with IRISContainer.community() as iris:
    conn = iris.get_connection()
    # ... do work ...
# __exit__ calls iris stop IRIS quietly before docker stop
```

`stop_gracefully()` is also callable directly:
```python
iris.stop_gracefully()   # Returns True on success, False if container not running
docker stop container    # Safe to call after
```

---

## Why a Webgateway, CPF Merge, or stop_grace_period Alone Is Not Enough

| Approach | Does it prevent data loss? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `stop_grace_period: 60s` | ❌ | IRIS doesn't trap SIGTERM by default |
| `stop_signal: SIGUSR1` | ❌ | IRIS ignores SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 |
| `iris stop IRIS quietly` via exec | ✅ | Explicit graceful shutdown with WIJ flush |
| Custom entrypoint that traps SIGTERM | ✅ | Intercepts SIGTERM → runs iris stop → exits |

---

## Custom Entrypoint (Full SIGTERM Trap)

For docker-compose without manual pre-stop:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# graceful-iris-entrypoint.sh
/iris-main &
IRIS_PID=$!
trap 'iris stop IRIS quietly; wait $IRIS_PID' SIGTERM INT TERM
wait $IRIS_PID
```

```yaml
services:
  iris:
    entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "/graceful-iris-entrypoint.sh"]
    stop_grace_period: 60s
    volumes:
      - ./graceful-iris-entrypoint.sh:/graceful-iris-entrypoint.sh:ro
```

Note: This conflicts with the standard IRIS `-b`/`-a` hook mechanism. Use only if you don't need pre/post hooks.

---

## Kubernetes PreStop Hook

```yaml
lifecycle:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: ["iris", "stop", "IRIS", "quietly"]
terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
```

---

## Diagnosis

```bash
# After restart, check WIJ state at startup
docker logs <container> 2>&1 | grep -i "wij\|journal\|recover\|dirty\|clean"

# Clean startup:   "Journal startup: WIJ is clean"
# Recovery needed: "Journal startup: WIJ recovery in progress"
```

Recovery after dirty stop is not data loss — it's slow. If rows are missing after recovery, the writes were not committed before the kill.
