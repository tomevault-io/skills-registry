# VS Code Extension Developer Skill

You are an expert in Visual Studio Code extension development. Use this skill to guide the user through the lifecycle of creating, enhancing, and publishing extensions.

## 1. Project Structure & Manifest (`package.json`)

The `package.json` is the manifest file and is crucial for VS Code extensions.

- **`engines.vscode`**: Specifies the minimum compatible version of VS Code.
- **`activationEvents`**: Array of events that trigger your extension's activation (e.g., `onCommand:id`, `onLanguage:id`, `workspaceContains:**\/package.json`, or `*`). _Note: VS Code 1.74+ handles many activation events automatically based on contribution points._
- **`contributes`**: The core configuration for UI elements and capabilities.
  - `commands`: Register commands visible in the Command Palette.
  - `menus`: Add commands to menus (e.g., `editor/context`, `view/title`).
  - `viewsContainers`: Add custom sidebars/activity bars.
  - `views`: Add tree views to containers.
  - `configuration`: Define user settings.
  - `keybindings`: Bind commands to keyboard shortcuts.
- **`main`**: The entry point file (e.g., `./out/extension.js`).

## 2. Development Workflow

- **Setup**: Ensure `vscode` module is installed (`npm install vscode`). _Note: The `vscode` module is deprecated; use `@types/vscode` for development and rely on the engine version._
- **Running**: Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the **Extension Development Host**. This opens a new window with your extension loaded.
- **Reloading**: Use `Ctrl+R` (or `Cmd+R` on Mac) in the Extension Development Host to reload changes.
- **Debugging**: Set breakpoints in your source code. Use the Debug Console to inspect variables.

## 3. The `vscode` API

- **`vscode.commands`**: `registerCommand` to bind logic to command IDs.
- **`vscode.window`**:
  - `showInformationMessage`, `showErrorMessage` for notifications.
  - `createStatusBarItem` for status bar entries.
  - `createTreeView` for custom views.
  - `activeTextEditor` for the current editor.
- **`vscode.workspace`**:
  - `getConfiguration` for settings.
  - `workspaceFolders` for open folders.
  - `fs` for file system operations (use this over Node's `fs` when possible for remote support).
- **`vscode.languages`**: Register completion providers, hover providers, diagnostics, etc.

## 4. Best Practices

- **Lazy Activation**: Only activate your extension when necessary. Avoid using `*` activation unless absolutely required.
- **Disposables**: Always push created resources (commands, listeners) to `context.subscriptions` to ensure they are cleaned up when the extension is deactivated.
  ```typescript
  context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
  ```
- **Webviews**: Use strict Content Security Policy (CSP). Use `asWebviewUri` to load local resources.
- **Performance**: Do not block the main thread. Use `async/await` for I/O and heavy operations.

## 5. Testing

- Use `@vscode/test-electron` or `@vscode/test-cli` for integration tests.
- Tests run inside a special instance of VS Code.

## 6. Packaging and Publishing

- **Tool**: `vsce` (Visual Studio Code Extensions CLI).
- **Install**: `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`.
- **Package**: `vsce package` creates a `.vsix` file.
- **Publish**: `vsce publish` uploads to the Marketplace (requires a Personal Access Token).
- **Files**: Ensure `.vscodeignore` is configured to exclude development files (src, tsconfig.json, etc.) from the package.

## 7. Common Tasks

### Registering a Command

```typescript
import * as vscode from "vscode";

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand(
    "myExtension.helloWorld",
    () => {
      vscode.window.showInformationMessage("Hello World!");
    },
  );

  context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
}
```

### Tree View Provider

Implement `vscode.TreeDataProvider<T>`.

- `getTreeItem(element: T): vscode.TreeItem`
- `getChildren(element?: T): ProviderResult<T[]>`

### Configuration

Access settings defined in `package.json`:

```typescript
const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("myExtension");
const value = config.get("mySetting");
```
