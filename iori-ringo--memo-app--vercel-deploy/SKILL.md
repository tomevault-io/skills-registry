# Vercel Deploy

Deploy any project to Vercel instantly. No authentication required.

## How It Works

1. Packages your project into a tarball (excludes `node_modules` and `.git`)
2. Auto-detects framework from `package.json`
3. Uploads to deployment service
4. Returns **Preview URL** (live site) and **Claim URL** (transfer to your Vercel account)

## Usage

```bash
# Use run_command tool:
# CommandLine: bash deploy.sh [path]
# Cwd: /Users/IORIK1001/coding/MyPortfolio/.agent/skills/vercel-deploy/scripts
```

**Arguments:**
- `path` - Directory to deploy, or a `.tgz` file (defaults to current directory). If deploying a specific path, ensure it is an absolute path or relative to the Cwd.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Deploy current project root (assuming Cwd is set to scripts dir, and referencing project root)
# It's better to pass the absolute path to the project root.
CommandLine: bash deploy.sh /Users/IORIK1001/coding/MyPortfolio
Cwd: /Users/IORIK1001/coding/MyPortfolio/.agent/skills/vercel-deploy/scripts
```

## Output

```
Preparing deployment...
Detected framework: nextjs
Creating deployment package...
Deploying...
✓ Deployment successful!

Preview URL: https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app
Claim URL:   https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...
```

The script also outputs JSON to stdout for programmatic use:

```json
{
  "previewUrl": "https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app",
  "claimUrl": "https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...",
  "deploymentId": "dpl_...",
  "projectId": "prj_..."
}
```

## Framework Detection

The script auto-detects frameworks from `package.json`. Supported frameworks include:

- **React**: Next.js, Gatsby, Create React App, Remix, React Router
- **Vue**: Nuxt, Vitepress, Vuepress, Gridsome
- **Svelte**: SvelteKit, Svelte, Sapper
- **Other Frontend**: Astro, Solid Start, Angular, Ember, Preact, Docusaurus
- **Backend**: Express, Hono, Fastify, NestJS, Elysia, h3, Nitro
- **Build Tools**: Vite, Parcel
- **And more**: Blitz, Hydrogen, RedwoodJS, Storybook, Sanity, etc.

For static HTML projects (no `package.json`), framework is set to `null`.

## Static HTML Projects

For projects without a `package.json`:
- If there's a single `.html` file not named `index.html`, it gets renamed automatically
- This ensures the page is served at the root URL (`/`)

## Present Results to User

Always show both URLs:

```
✓ Deployment successful!

Preview URL: https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app
Claim URL:   https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...

View your site at the Preview URL.
To transfer this deployment to your Vercel account, visit the Claim URL.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Network Egress Error

If deployment fails due to network restrictions (common on claude.ai), tell the user:

```
Deployment failed due to network restrictions. To fix this:

1. Go to https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities
2. Add *.vercel.com to the allowed domains
3. Try deploying again
```
