# Apple Wallet Passes

This skill helps you guide users through the full lifecycle of Apple Wallet passes — from choosing
the right pass style, through design and development, to signing, distribution, and updates.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill for any of these scenarios:

- Creating a new Wallet pass (boarding pass, coupon, event ticket, store card, generic pass)
- Designing pass layouts and choosing the right pass style
- Setting up pass signing with Apple-issued certificates
- Distributing passes via app, email, or web
- Implementing pass updates with push notifications
- Working with NFC readers or barcode scanning
- Adding "Add to Apple Wallet" badges
- Implementing the Verify with Wallet API or ID Verifier
- Questions about PassKit framework or WalletPasses documentation

## Pass Styles Overview

Apple Wallet supports five pass styles. Choosing the correct style is critical because it determines
the visual layout, the information hierarchy, and how time/location relevance works.

| Style | Use Case | Examples |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Boarding Pass** | Travel & transit | Flight, train, bus passes |
| **Coupon** | Promotions & discounts | Store coupons, promotional offers |
| **Event Ticket** | Time-bound events | Concert, movie, sports tickets |
| **Store Card** | Loyalty & rewards | Loyalty cards, gift cards, membership |
| **Generic Pass** | Everything else | Membership cards, claim tickets, insurance cards |

The style affects how relevance (time window and location radius) is interpreted. A boarding pass
relevance window is very different from a movie ticket — always match the style to the actual use case.

## Development Workflow

Walk the user through these steps in order, adapting to where they are in the process:

### 1. Choose the Pass Style

Ask the user what kind of pass they're building. Help them pick the right style based on
their use case. If it's ambiguous (e.g., a gym membership), explain the tradeoffs between
Store Card and Generic Pass.

### 2. Design the Pass

- Passes should be clear, optimized, and look great on all devices
- Point users to the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/wallet/) for design best practices
- Key design considerations: logo, strip image, icon, relevant text fields, barcode placement

### 3. Build the Pass with PassKit

- Use the PassKit framework for creating, distributing, and updating passes
- A pass is a signed bundle (`.pkpass` file) containing a `pass.json` manifest and assets
- Point to [PassKit documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/) for API details
- For web distribution, see [WalletPasses documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/walletpasses/)

### 4. Sign the Pass

Passes must be signed with an Apple-issued certificate tied to the developer's Apple Developer account.

Key points to communicate:
- Certificates are managed in [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/create-certificates/certificates-overview/)
- Only apps from the same team with proper entitlements can access the passes
- **Expired certificate**: Existing passes on devices still work, but no new passes can be signed and no updates sent
- **Revoked certificate**: Passes stop functioning — this is a critical distinction to highlight

### 5. Distribute the Pass

Three distribution channels:
1. **In-app** — Use PassKit API to present the pass with the "Add to Wallet" badge
2. **Email** — Attach the `.pkpass` file; recipients tap to add
3. **Web** — Host the pass for download; use the "Add to Wallet" badge

Important details:
- Users can add passes without installing a related app
- If there is a related app, users can install it directly from the pass
- iCloud syncs passes across all of a user's devices
- Use the [Add to Apple Wallet badge guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/wallet/add-to-apple-wallet-guidelines/) for branding

### 6. Update Passes

Two update mechanisms:
- **Push notifications** — Server sends update notification; user taps to see changes
- **Pull-to-refresh** — User manually refreshes on the back of the pass

Common update scenarios: gate changes, balance adjustments, schedule changes.

### 7. Accept / Redeem Passes

Three redemption methods:

| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **NFC** | Contactless redemption; user holds device near reader. No barcode needed. For Apple Pay loyalty, see [loyalty passes docs](https://developer.apple.com/wallet/loyalty-passes/). |
| **Barcode** | Supports QR, Aztec, PDF417 formats. Screen locks to portrait and boosts backlight. Optical scanners work better than laser scanners for iPhone screens. |
| **Text fallback** | Membership/account number displayed below barcode for manual entry. |

### 8. Identity Verification (Optional)

Two APIs for identity verification:
- **Verify with Wallet API** — Age or identity verification using ID stored in Wallet. [Learn more](https://developer.apple.com/wallet/get-started-with-verify-with-wallet/)
- **ID Verifier** — Use iPhone as a mobile ID reader for in-person verification, no external hardware needed. [Learn more](https://developer.apple.com/wallet/id-verifier/)

## Common Questions

When users ask these, here's how to respond:

**"What happens if my certificate expires?"**
→ Existing passes on devices continue to work. You just can't sign new passes or push updates.

**"What barcode format should I use?"**
→ QR is the most universal. Aztec is compact and used by airlines. PDF417 is used for some legacy systems. Test with your actual scanning hardware.

**"Can users add passes without my app?"**
→ Yes. Passes can be added via email or web without any app installed.

**"How do I test pass scanning?"**
→ Always test with the actual hardware you'll use. Optical scanners handle iPhone screens much better than laser scanners.

structure, server-side update flow, and code examples.
