description: Keep the UI synchronized with GA algorithm changes. Use when you modify genetic algorithm logic (genes, gates, libraries, injection, telemetry) and need to identify and update affected UI components across tabs (Dashboard, DNA, Genes, Library, Analysis, etc.) and shared surfaces (ControlPanel, SimulationStatusSidebar). Maps algorithm state to UI representations. Use when this capability is needed.

# GA Algorithm UI Sync

When you change the genetic algorithm (GA) implementation—whether adding new gene types, introducing injection mechanisms, modifying telemetry, or refactoring selection logic—the UI must be updated to reflect these changes. This skill identifies which UI components need updates and provides specific, actionable guidance for each.

## When to Use This Skill

- You modify `src/algorithm/` core logic
- You change gene types, gate definitions, or node operations
- You implement new telemetry (e.g., injection stats, eligibility diagnostics)
- You adjust mutation strategies or population dynamics
- You add/modify worker messages or state structures
- You want to ensure UI consistency across all tabs after algorithm changes
- You're unsure which components are affected by a GA change

**Keywords:** algorithm, GA, genes, gates, injection, library, mutation, population, telemetry, UI sync, components, tabs

## How This Skill Works

This skill maps GA algorithm changes to UI surfaces in your application:

### 1. Identify the Change Type
Determine what part of the algorithm changed:
- **Gene/Gate definitions** (types, parameters, logic)
- **Library system** (injection, elite/protected status, tenure)
- **Mutation strategy** (structural, parametric, smart injection)
- **Telemetry** (new stats, logs, diagnostic data)
- **Population dynamics** (selection, crossover, reproduction)
- **Worker communication** (new messages, state payloads)

### 2. Map to Affected Components
Use the component matrix below to identify all affected surfaces.

### 3. Apply Recommendations
For each affected component, apply the specific update recommendations provided.

## UI Component Architecture

### Shared / Always-Visible Components
These appear in **all tabs** and should be updated first:

#### `src/components/SimulationStatusSidebar.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Main configuration panel + live status display
- **Affected by:** mutation rates, injection config, real-time stats
- **Update trigger:** telemetry changes, config additions, status updates
- **Key props:** population size, mutation rate, injection rate, library stats

#### `src/components/ControlPanel.tsx`
- **Purpose:** GA parameter tuning (in sidebar tabs: GENERAL, GENERATION, DNA)
- **Affected by:** new GA parameters, library configuration
- **Tabs:**
  - `GENERAL`: symbol, run/stop, data sync, exports
  - `GENERATION`: population, mutation, time step, tournament
  - `DNA`: action threshold, genes per DNA, tree configuration
  - *Implicit:* Gene Library section (injection rate slider)
- **Update trigger:** new configurable parameters, slider ranges, slider labels

#### `src/components/LoadingOverlay.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Show blocking loading states
- **Affected by:** new long-running initialization phases (e.g., library warmup)
- **Update trigger:** new status strings like "Library warmup", "Calculating eligibility"

### Tab-Specific Components

  - Local view: per-generation stats (current behavior)
  - Global view: links to Library tab
- Add status badges (Elite, Protected, Blacklisted)
- Consider **deprecation** if Library tab becomes the primary gene insight surface
- If kept, position as a "generation snapshot" complement to Library

---

#### 5) Library

  - Scatter: activations vs quality score per node
- Explain what each metric means:
  - "Library warmup": low eligible count early is normal
  - "High miss rate": library is too restrictive
  - "Elite threshold too high": adjust eliteQualityThreshold config

**Update recommendations:**
- Add **"Library Lineage"** section showing:
  - Which genes/gates in this DNA came from library vs random
  - Source tag for each node
  - Status of each injected gene
- Add **"Lock to Library"** toggle for successful runs:
  - Allow users to force-include winning genes in library
  - Archive this execution's DNA to hall of fame (optional)
- Show how nodes' individual performance compared to global stats

---

## Telemetry / Log Mapping

The worker logs gene library stats at each generation:

```
[GeneLib][Gen X] library=1247 nodes genes=850 gates=397 elite=42 protected=156 eligible=203 highConf=89 elitePool=31 highQ=45 act10+=203 act30+=89 avgQ=0.156 eliteQ=0.250 injected=47(63%) random=28 geneInj=42 gateInj=5 misses=3
```

**Map these fields to UI:**
- `library=`, `genes=`, `gates=`: Summary cards (Dashboard, Sidebar)
- `elite=`, `protected=`: Status breakdown
- `eligible=`, `highConf=`, `elitePool=`, `highQ=`: Eligibility diagnostics (Investigate)
- `avgQ=`, `eliteQ=`: Quality threshold charts
- `injected=`, `random=`, `*Inj=`: Injection stats panel (Library tab)
- `misses=`: Miss rate indicator

## Step-by-Step: Updating for a New Algorithm Feature

### Example: Adding a New Telemetry Metric (e.g., "diversityIndex")

1. **Implement in algorithm:**
   - Add `diversityIndex` to `LibrarySummary` type
   - Log it in worker: `diversity=0.73`
   - Send in `genComplete` payload

2. **Update Sidebar:**
   - Add to library status strip in `SimulationStatusSidebar.tsx`
   - Display as a metric with tooltip

3. **Update Dashboard:**
   - Add to `GenePoolHealthWidget`
   - Show as a gauge or mini chart

4. **Update Investigate:**
   - Add line chart for diversity over generations
   - Explain what "good diversity" looks like

5. **Update Academy:**
   - Add explanation of diversity metric

6. **Wire state:**
   - Ensure `useEvolution` hook parses and memoizes the metric
   - Pass to all affected components

### Example: Adding a New Configuration Parameter (e.g., "draftPickRatio")

1. **Add to ControlPanel:**
   - Add slider to DNA tab or new LIBRARY tab
   - Range: 0% (always elite) to 100% (always untested)
   - Update label: "Draft Pick Ratio" with helpful description

2. **Update SimulationStatusSidebar:**
   - Show current value in library status strip
   - Optional: show impact on injection behavior

3. **Update Academy:**
   - Explain draft pick strategy and when to adjust

4. **Wire to worker:**
   - Pass in `StartPayload` and `UpdateConfigPayload`
   - Set in `SmartInjector` config

### Example: Adding a New Gene Type

1. **Register gene:**
   - Implement in `src/algorithm/indicators/`
   - Register in gene registry

2. **Update Strategy Lab:**
   - Gene appears in manual selection UI
   - Auto-detect category (Trend, Oscillator, etc.)

3. **Update Analysis:**
   - Show new gene type if used in selected DNA
   - Display its global stats from library

4. **Update Dashboard:**
   - Adjust category breakdown to include new type
   - Show in library health widget category distribution

5. **Update Academy:**
   - Explain new gene type and use cases

## Prerequisites

- Access to `src/algorithm/` to understand the GA change
- Familiarity with `src/components/` structure
- Understanding of `useEvolution` hook and worker state
- Knowledge of telemetry fields logged by worker

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Component doesn't see new library data | Ensure `useEvolution` hook is updated to parse worker payload. Check `genComplete` listener. |
| UI shows stale library stats | Memoization issue. Verify `useMemo` dependencies include library summary. |
| Slider doesn't affect GA behavior | Check that `StartPayload` includes the new config and worker reads it. |
| Library widgets show no data | Ensure worker has initialized library. Check `GeneLibraryWorkerIntegration` is instantiated in `handleStart`. |
| Gene not appearing in Library tab | Node key generation may differ. Check `nodeToKey()` function and quantization rules match. |
