# PR Review Comment Triage

This skill automates end-to-end handling of PR review comments for the current branch: detect a PR, fetch open review comments, evaluate each, fix issues when appropriate, resolve threads after fixes, and reply when comments are not applicable or need clarification.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Explicitly asks to "check PR review comments", "triage review comments", "fix review comments", or "resolve PR comments"
- Mentions they "got comments" or "received feedback" on a PR
- Says things like "please review them" (referring to PR comments)
- Asks to "handle PR feedback", "address review comments", or "look at the PR comments"
- Mentions "Copilot reviewed" or "reviewer left comments"
- Asks to "fix what the reviewer said" or "address the review"
- References PR comments implicitly with phrases like "there are comments on our PR"

**Key trigger phrases:**
- "got some comments on our PR"
- "please review them" (in PR context)
- "review comments need addressing"
- "PR has feedback"
- "check the comments"
- "fix review comments"
- "triage PR comments"
- "handle the review"

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated.
- Repository has a PR associated with the current branch.
- You can run tests/builds if needed to validate fixes.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1) Identify the PR for the current branch
1. Determine the current branch name.
2. Use `gh pr view` to locate a PR for the branch.
3. If no PR exists, stop and report: “No PR found for current branch.”

### 2) Fetch open review comments and threads
1. Use proper GraphQL syntax with `-f` and `-F` flags (single quotes, no double quotes around query).
2. Use the **reviews GraphQL endpoint** to fetch all review comments with their thread status:
   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='query($owner:String!,$name:String!,$number:Int!){repository(owner:$owner,name:$name){pullRequest(number:$number){reviews(last:100){nodes{id author{login} body state comments(last:50){nodes{id body author{login} path line}}}}}}}' -F owner="OWNER" -F name="REPO" -F number=PR_NUMBER
   ```
3. **Filter to unresolved threads only**:
   - For each review, check if it already has a reply from the PR author (you) in a subsequent review.
   - Skip review comments where the author is **not** the reviewer bot (e.g., `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`).
   - A thread is considered **resolved** if:
     - There is a reply from the PR author addressing it, OR
     - The thread was explicitly marked as resolved via GitHub UI/GraphQL.
   - To check explicit resolution status, use the `reviewThreads` query (if available) and filter by `isResolved: false`.
4. Group remaining **unresolved** comments by file and thread for context.
5. **Identify new comments** by comparing timestamps: comments created after the last commit on the branch are likely new and need attention.

### 3) Evaluate each comment (Critical: Be skeptical)
For each comment or thread:
- **Do NOT accept comments at face value** — critically evaluate whether it is valid and truly requires a code change.
- Ask: "Is this a real issue or just a style preference? Does this comment target a symptom or the root cause?"
- If valid:
  - Identify required files/logic.
  - **Check for deeper issues**: If the fix seems like a patch, consider if a more fundamental refactor is needed.
  - If a patch would only mask the real problem, escalate the approach decision (ask in chat, don't just patch).
  - Make targeted changes aligned with the actual root cause.
  - Run relevant tests if needed (unit/integration/e2e where applicable).
- If not valid:
  - Draft a clear response explaining why it does not apply.
  - Provide evidence (links, reasoning, or test results).
- If ambiguous or suggests root refactor:
  - Ask focused clarification questions in the PR thread.
  - **Explain the generalized fix** vs. the patch approach and ask which is preferred.

### 4) Apply fixes (if needed)
- Implement code changes.
- Re-run appropriate tests.
- Capture outputs relevant to the comment.

### 4.5) Commit and push (when authorized)
- If the user has authorized commits/pushes, commit the fixes and push them to the PR branch **before** replying/resolving.
- This ensures your thread replies can reference an actual commit SHA and reviewers can immediately see the updated code.

### 5) Respond and resolve each thread
**Critical**: For **each unresolved comment thread**, you must:
1. **Post a reply** to the specific comment thread explaining the fix or reasoning
   - Use `gh pr review --comment-id COMMENT_ID` to reply directly to the comment thread
  - OR use GraphQL `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` mutation to add a reply
   - OR use `gh pr comment 11` to post a general comment first, then resolve threads
2. **Resolve the thread** after replying
   - Fetch the thread ID: `gh api graphql -f query='query($owner:String!,$name:String!,$number:Int!){repository(owner:$owner,name:$name){pullRequest(number:$number){reviewThreads(first:10){nodes{id isResolved}}}}}' -F owner="OWNER" -F name="REPO" -F number=PR_NUMBER`
   - Resolve using GraphQL mutation: `gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){thread{id isResolved}}}' -F id="THREAD_ID"`

Process flow:
- **If fixed**: Commit + push (if authorized) → Reply in thread with fix summary (include commit/tests) → Resolve thread
- **If not applicable**: Reply with explanation → Do not resolve (let reviewer decide)
- **If needs clarification**: Reply with questions → Keep thread open for response

## Decision Rules

- **Fix** if it affects correctness, safety, user experience, or maintainability.
- **Defer** if it’s a style preference without project-wide standard.
- **Reject** only with clear evidence or intent mismatch.
- **Ask** if the requested change conflicts with current architecture or is unclear.
- **Escalate for broader refactor** if the fix would be a patch that masks a deeper architectural or design issue—describe both the patch and root-cause approach in chat and ask before proceeding.

## Handling Duplicate or Already-Addressed Comments

When a comment appears to be a duplicate of a previously addressed issue:
1. **Verify**: Check if the underlying issue was already fixed in a previous commit or is no longer relevant due to code changes.
2. **Reply**: Post a brief reply noting the status:
   - "This was addressed in commit [hash] / previous review round."
   - "This code was removed/changed - comment no longer applies."
3. **Resolve**: Mark the thread as resolved after replying.

**Important**: Every comment must receive either a reply + resolution (if addressed) or a reply without resolution (if needs discussion). Never skip comments or leave them in limbo.

## Checklist Before Completing Triage

- [ ] All unresolved threads have been evaluated
- [ ] Each comment has either been: fixed + resolved, rejected with reply, or left open with clarifying question
- [ ] No comment was silently skipped or marked as "duplicate" without a reply
- [ ] Tests pass after all fixes
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed
## Recommended GitHub CLI Commands

- Find PR for current branch:
  - `gh pr view --json number,headRefName,title,url`
- **Fetch all reviews with comments** (preferred for detecting new comments):
  ```bash
  gh api graphql -f query='query($owner:String!,$name:String!,$number:Int!){repository(owner:$owner,name:$name){pullRequest(number:$number){reviews(last:100){nodes{id author{login} body state submittedAt comments(last:50){nodes{id body author{login} path line}}}}}}}' -F owner="OWNER" -F name="REPO" -F number=PR_NUMBER
  ```
- **Identify unresolved comments**:
  - Look for reviews from `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` (or other reviewers).
  - Check if a subsequent review from the PR author (you) replies to the same file/line.
  - If no reply exists, the comment is unresolved.
- Reply to a thread:
  - `gh pr review --comment-id COMMENT_ID` (reply to specific comment)
  - `gh api graphql` (post comment via GraphQL mutation)
  - `gh pr comment` (post general comment on PR)
- Resolve thread:
  - Fetch thread IDs: `gh api graphql -f query='query($owner:String!,$name:String!,$number:Int!){repository(owner:$owner,name:$name){pullRequest(number:$number){reviewThreads(first:10){nodes{id isResolved}}}}}' -F owner="OWNER" -F name="REPO" -F number=PR_NUMBER`
  - Resolve with mutation: `gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){thread{id isResolved}}}' -F id="THREAD_ID"`

## Response Templates

### Fixed
“Fixed in [commit/changes]. Re-ran relevant tests: [tests]. Resolving.”

### Not Applicable
“Thanks! I reviewed this and it’s not applicable because [reason]. If you’d like a different approach, happy to adjust.”

### Needs Clarification
“Can you clarify [specific point]? I want to make sure the fix aligns with your intent.”

## Troubleshooting

- **No PR found**: Ensure branch is pushed and has an open PR.
- **No open threads**: Report that there are no unresolved comments.
- **Permission errors**: Confirm `gh auth status` and repository access.
- **Cannot resolve threads**: Ensure the token has `pull_request:write` permissions.
- **GraphQL syntax errors** (`Expected VAR_SIGN, actual: BANG...`):
  - **Root cause**: Double quotes around the query string cause shell escaping issues with GraphQL variable syntax (`$var!`).
  - **Solution**: Use the `-f` flag for inline query strings, NOT double quotes. Example:
    ```bash
    gh api graphql -f query='query($owner:String!,$name:String!){...}' -F owner="iradkot" -F name="genetic-algorithm-stock-academy"
    ```
  - The `-F` flag automatically quotes string variables, avoiding shell interpretation of `!` characters.
  - If using `-f query="..."` instead of `-f query='...'`, the shell interprets `!` as history expansion, breaking the query.
