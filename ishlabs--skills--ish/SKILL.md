description: "Use this skill whenever the user mentions ish, a study, a person, a simulation run, an \"ask\", a group of people, a chatbot probe, wants to dispatch tests against AI participants, or wants to rehearse a conversation between two AI personas (e.g. sales rep vs. skeptical buyer). Covers both the `ish` CLI (via Bash) and the hosted ish MCP server (`mcp__claude_ai_ish__*` on claude.ai) — same operations, pick whichever your environment has. Read this skill first to orient on the mental model, then trust `ish docs` (CLI) or the MCP tool descriptions for argument details."

# ish

ish runs user-research simulations: simulated people experience your draft (page, copy, ad, pitch, chatbot, video, document) and report what they noticed, where they stalled, what they would do next. Use before shipping, when you need a fast reaction round, or to rehearse a conversation between two AI personas.

## When to invoke

The user mentioned `ish`, a study, an "ask", a person, a group of people, a simulation, "rehearse", "compare variants", "test before shipping", "probe a chatbot".

## Drivers

ish has two surfaces; pick whichever your environment has:

- **MCP** — `mcp__claude_ai_ish__*` on claude.ai. Tool descriptions are authoritative for argument schemas.
- **CLI** — the `ish` binary. `ish --help` per command; `ish docs overview` / `ish docs list` / `ish docs search` / `ish docs get-page <slug>` for concept docs.

Both wrap the same operations. If neither is present, tell the user: `npm i -g @ishlabs/cli`, or enable the ish connector on claude.ai. Don't try to drive ish without a driver.

**Bridging CLI → MCP for the user's editor / desktop agent**: if the user has the CLI but their editor or desktop agent (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Windsurf) isn't yet wired to call ish, one command does it: `ish mcp add --all --yes`. Writes the per-client MCP config block, never embeds a token (OAuth on first connect), idempotent. See `ish docs get-page guides/mcp-add`.

**When both are available, pick by op:**
- Streaming results to a watching user → **CLI** with `--wait` (per-participant output as participants complete).
- Structured one-shot reads or run dispatch → **MCP** (JSON in, JSON out, no shell).
- Idempotent setup (e.g. cold-start workspace) → **CLI** has `--ensure`; MCP doesn't.
- Local file uploads (images, video, docs) → **CLI** only — MCP doesn't accept binaries.

**Naming convention in this skill**: shapes below use MCP tool names (`ask_run`, `study_create`, `chat_endpoint_init`, …). The CLI equivalents are the same names kebab-cased under a noun group (`ish ask run`, `ish study create`, `ish chat endpoint init`, …). When in doubt: `ish --help` or `ish <noun> --help`.

## Mental model

```
Workspace (= product)
├── Person (p-…)    reusable AI persona
├── Study (s-…)              persistent artifact for testing a real surface
│   └── Iteration (i-…)      one configured run; carries the URL or media
├── Ask (a-…)                lightweight artifact for reactions to text/image variants
│   └── Round                unit of execution; participants fixed at ask creation
└── Chat Endpoint            workspace-level definition of an external chatbot
                              (referenced by study modality: chat, mode: external_chatbot)
```

**Audience is a query, not an entity.** Both `ask_run` and `study_run` take an `audience` argument shaped as `{ person_ids: [...] }` (explicit) or `{ sample: N, filters: {...} }` (sampled from an existing pool). There is no `audience` resource to create — you build profiles via `group_build` (or reuse existing ones via `profile_list`) and pass them in.

Two run verbs:
- **study run** — simulate on a real surface (URL, media, document, chat endpoint).
- **ask run** — react to text or image variants.

Heuristic: **study** for "test this prototype/page/flow"; **ask** for "which copy/image lands better".

## Workflow shapes

Each shape names the verb, the *required precursors*, and the **load-bearing knobs** — the arguments that change output quality, not just behavior. Look up the full schema in the MCP tool description or `ish <command> --help` once you've picked the shape.

Examples below use MCP shape; for CLI, kebab-case the tool name (`ask_run` → `ish ask run`) and pass equivalent flags (`person_ids: [...]` → `--person-id p-… --person-id p-…`).

### Compare text or image variants → `ask_run`

- **Precursor**: a group of people (see "Audience is a query" above). If you don't already have suitable people, build them first via `group_build`; reuse via `profile_list` when possible.
- **Load-bearing knobs**:
  - `wants_pick: true` — adds an aggregate winner verdict. Without it you get prose reactions but no clear answer.
  - `wants_ratings: true` — adds per-variant numeric scores.
  - `wait: true` — block until done. Without it you get a round id and have to poll.
  - `variants` — array of `{ label, content }` for text, or `{ label, image_url }` for hosted images. Two or more variants required for `wants_pick` to be meaningful (with N=1 it degrades to a prose reaction round). **Local image files**: only the CLI accepts them. Use `--variant LABEL:@./path.png` per file (the `@` prefix triggers upload); MCP requires a hosted URL.
  - `ask_id` (optional) — passing an existing `a-…` id re-runs against that ask. Omit (or pass `--new` on the CLI) to create a new ask in one shot.
- **Shape**:
  ```
  ask_run({
    variants:  [ { label: "A", content: "..." }, { label: "B", content: "..." } ],
    audience:  { person_ids: ["p-…", ...] },   // or { sample: 10 }
    wants_pick: true,
    wants_ratings: true,
    wait: true,
  })
  ```
- **Output**: per-participant reasoning + (if `wants_pick`) aggregate winner with confidence.

### Test a live page or prototype → `study_run` (modality: interactive)

- **Precursor**: a study with a URL. Either inline at create-time (`study_create({ modality: "interactive", url: "..." })`) or as a separate iteration (`iteration_create({ study_id, url })`) when you want to A/B iterations later or upload local files. An **assignment** is required — what the participant is supposed to attempt.
- **Audience**: pass `audience: { person_ids: [...] }` or `{ sample: N }` to `study_run`, same contract as `ask_run`. Audience is set on the *run*, not the study.
- **Load-bearing knobs**:
  - `assignment` (on `study_create`) — what the participant is supposed to do. Format: `"<label>:<instruction>"`. The whole run hinges on this being clear.
  - **steps (optional checklist)** — an assignment can carry an ordered `steps` list of atomic actions (`{name, description?}`), authored via the CLI JSON forms (`--assignments-file` / `--assignments`) — not the `"<label>:<instruction>"` shorthand. Honored for **interactive** and **external_chatbot chat** only. After a run, `study get` reports a per-step `step_completion` rollup (pass rate + sample failures). Use steps when "did they finish?" is a checklist, not a single yes/no.
  - `wait` (MCP) / `--wait` (CLI) — streams per-participant results as they complete. CLI streams to stdout in real-time; MCP blocks until the whole run finishes. For a watching user, prefer the CLI here.
  - `count` (on `study_run`) — how many participants.
- **Shape**:
  ```
  study_create({
    modality: "interactive",
    url: "https://staging.acme.io/welcome",
    assignment: "Complete signup:Go through the 4-step wizard end-to-end",
  })
  study_run({ study_id: "s-…", audience: { person_ids: [...] }, count: 15, wait: true })
  ```
- **Output**: per-participant journey transcripts + aggregate friction / blocker / positive-moment counts.
- **Local web app?** Prefer `ish study run --local` (CLI) — it runs the browser ON your machine (Playwright) against the iteration URL, including a plain `http://localhost:3000`, **no tunnel needed**. `ish connect <port>` (a Cloudflare tunnel) is only for letting the **remote** cloud fleet reach your localhost. See workflow §7.

### Test a native iOS / Android app on a local device → `study_run --local` (interactive, CLI-only)

- **Precursors**:
  1. Local toolchain ready: `ish check ios` / `ish check android` (Xcode + simulators / adb + an AVD); `ish setup` installs the missing local-sim deps. These gate the run — `ish check ios || ish setup`.
  2. A study (`study_create({ modality: "interactive", assignment: "..." })`) — platform-agnostic; the **iteration** names the platform + app.
  3. A native iteration: `ish iteration create --platform ios|android --app <bundle-id | ./Build.app | ./app.apk>` (stored as `app_artifact`; **no `--url`**; `screen_format` defaults to mobile_portrait). `--app` is optional at create time — supply it on the run instead for "chosen at run time".
- **CLI-only**: native local runs are a CLI feature; there is no MCP `*_run --local` path.
- **Load-bearing knobs** (on `ish study run`):
  - `--local` — run on your machine (vs the remote cloud fleet). Required for native device runs.
  - `--platform ios|android` — defaults to the iteration's; override per run.
  - `--app <path>` — override the stored target with a fresh local build, or supply one when the iteration stored none.
  - `--parallel N` — drive a pool of N devices at once (auto-sized to host RAM, default 1, max 5); one participant per device, torn down after.
  - `--max-interactions <n>` — cap the per-participant on-device loop (default 20). The lever that bounds runtime + cost.
  - `--wait` — block until participants are terminal and return per-participant results (same as remote `--wait`).
- **State reset between participants**: with a local `.app`/`.apk` the runner uninstall+reinstalls before each participant (no state leak); a bare bundle-id / system app can't be reinstalled and warns once that earlier state may persist.
- **Shape**:
  ```bash
  ish check ios || ish setup
  ish study create --name "Onboarding" --modality interactive \
      --assignment "Explore:Open the app and look around" --question "How clear was it?"
  ish iteration create --platform ios --app ./Build/MyApp.app
  ish study run --local --platform ios --max-interactions 15 --all -y --wait
  ```
- **Output**: per-participant journey + sentiment + per-interaction screenshots (`ish study get <id>`, each interaction carries `screenshot_url`). Full walkthrough: `ish docs get-page guides/native-app`.

### Probe a customer chatbot → `study_run` (modality: chat, mode: external_chatbot)

- **Precursors**:
  1. A **chat endpoint** definition at the workspace level. `chat_endpoint_init` from a curl spec (handles auth headers, request/response shape; **upsert-by-name** — safe to re-call with the same `name` to rotate auth or change the request shape) → `chat_endpoint_test` to confirm it responds correctly before dispatching simulated participants.
  2. A study with `modality: "chat"`, `mode: "external_chatbot"`, the endpoint reference, and an `assignment`.
- **Audience**: same `{ person_ids } | { sample }` contract; pass to `study_run`. For custom personas (e.g. "frustrated vs polite"), `group_build` first.
- **Load-bearing knobs**:
  - `assignment` — what the participant tries to do (`"Cancel:Try to cancel your subscription"`).
  - `count` on the run.
- **Shape**:
  ```
  chat_endpoint_init({ name: "support-bot", from_curl: "..." })  // or describe request shape directly
  chat_endpoint_test({ endpoint: "support-bot", message: "hi" })
  study_create({ modality: "chat", mode: "external_chatbot", endpoint: "support-bot",
                 assignment: "Cancel:Try to cancel your subscription" })
  study_run({ study_id: "s-…", audience: { person_ids: [...] }, count: 8, wait: true })
  ```
- **Output**: full conversation transcripts per participant + aggregate success / blocker analysis.

### Test a media artifact (document, image, video, audio) → `study_run`

- **Precursors**:
  1. A study with the chosen modality: `study_create({ modality: "document" | "image" | "video" | "audio", assignment: "..." })`.
  2. An **iteration** carrying the media. For local files, **CLI only** — `ish iteration create --study s-… --media @./deck.pdf` (the `@` prefix triggers upload). For hosted URLs, either driver works: `iteration_create({ study_id, content_url: "https://..." })`.
- **Audience**: same `{ person_ids } | { sample }` contract; pass to `study_run`. Reusable across runs (see "Lifecycle" below).
- **Load-bearing knobs**:
  - `assignment` on `study_create` — for review-style media (decks, ad creative), frame as decision: `"Take a first meeting:Review this Series A deck and decide whether you'd take a first meeting"`. Page/timestamp-level attribution depends on the assignment asking for it explicitly.
  - `wait` / `--wait` — same streaming story as interactive.
  - `count` on `study_run`.
- **Iterating on the artifact** (v2 deck, v3 deck): create a **new iteration** on the same study (`iteration_create`), reuse the people's `person_ids`. See "Lifecycle".
- **Output**: per-participant reactions to the artifact + aggregate themes.

### Rehearse a conversation between two AI personas → `study_run` (modality: chat, mode: participant_pair)

**If the user might want the same persona across multiple turns, pin profiles up-front — you can't retro-pin after a run.** Without pinning, personas are re-synthesized from the assignment text each time, so "the same VC from earlier" becomes prose-only continuity.

- **Precursor**: a workspace and (optionally) one or two people for persona pinning. If you skip the people, ish synthesizes both personas from the `assignment` text per-run — fine for one-shot rehearsals, drifts between iterations.
- **Audience**: optional. For persona continuity across iterations, build profiles via `group_build` (or reuse via `profile_list`) and pass `audience: { person_ids: [...] }` to `study_run` — the same profiles play the same roles each time.
- **Load-bearing knobs**:
  - `assignment` — encodes BOTH personas and what each is trying to do. More prose-heavy than other assignments; be specific. Example: `"Founder pitches Series A to skeptical VC. Founder: defends AI customer-support startup, $2M ARR, 15% MoM. VC: thinks SaaS-for-SaaS is saturated, probes moat and unit economics."`
  - `count` — typically 1 per run; set higher to generate variations.
- **Iterating the scenario** (turn-by-turn refinement): create a **new iteration** with a revised assignment; reuse the same `person_ids` if you pinned personas. See "Lifecycle".
- **Output**: a full transcript per rehearsal.

### Generate a fresh group → `group_build`

- **Input**: a `description`, a `count`, and optionally `sources` (transcripts / audio / images / docs that seed persona generation — for "make profiles that feel like these real customers"). Local files force CLI (binary upload constraint).
- **Output**: a list of `person_ids` to pass into `ask_run` or `study_run`.
- **Usage**: slow (~30-120s) + draws credits. Reuse profiles via `profile_list` when possible. Sensible defaults: `count: 5-10` for ad-hoc tests, `count: 20+` for studies where you want statistical signal.
- **Growing a group of people**: build only the delta — don't rebuild. Concat the new `person_ids` with the existing ones for the next run. The "audience is a query" framing means there's no audience entity to update.
- **Shapes**:
  ```
  // Simple — description only
  group_build({
    description: "Parents of toddlers (ages 1-3), US, evening-routine focused",
    count: 8,
  })
  // → { person_ids: ["p-…", ...] }

  // Seeded from real transcripts (CLI only for local files)
  // ish person generate --description "..." --count 10 \
  //   --source @./interviews/customer-1.md \
  //   --source @./interviews/customer-2.md
  ```

## Lifecycle (what to re-use vs create anew)

The most common multi-turn question: "user wants to change X — re-use the existing thing or create a new one?"

| Change you want | What to do |
|---|---|
| Same ask, **same participants**, new variants | Pass `ask_id` (MCP) or `--ask` (CLI) on `ask_run` — re-uses the locked participants. |
| Same ask, **different participants** | New ask: omit `ask_id` (MCP) or pass `--new` (CLI). Participants are locked at ask creation. |
| Same study, **new media** (v2 deck, new image) | New **iteration** on the same study (`iteration_create({ study_id, content_url \| --media @path })`). Iterations are immutable once they have results — never edit. |
| Same study, **new assignment** | **New study.** Assignment lives on the study; there's no in-place edit. Keep the old study's id for side-by-side comparison. *(Participant-pair exception: the assignment IS the content there — use a new **iteration** on the same study, not a new study.)* |
| Same people across multiple runs / studies | Reuse the `person_ids` array. Profiles are workspace-scoped resources (`p-…`) — they live independently of any ask or study. |
| Chat endpoint definition needs to change (auth rotate, URL change) | `chat_endpoint_init` is **upsert-by-name** — re-init with the same `name` and a new `from_curl` spec. Re-run `chat_endpoint_test` to confirm. |
| Persona reuse in participant-pair | Pin via `person_ids` on the first `study_run`; pass the same ids on subsequent runs. Without pinning, personas are re-synthesized from the assignment per run. |

When in doubt: side-by-side comparison usually beats in-place edits. Ids are cheap; result history isn't.

## Sharing results (no-login link)

To hand a study to someone **without an ish account** — a prospect, a stakeholder — create a public share link. `ish study share [study]` prints a no-login `share_url` to the web viewer (summary, key insights, participant journeys, interactive frames, segment breakdowns). `ish study share --list` lists your links; `ish study unshare <token>` revokes one (takes the **raw token**, not a study id/alias). `--expires <days>` auto-expires the link. Brand the link by setting a workspace logo first: `ish workspace update <id> --logo <url>` — the logo shows on the shared page. Share **after** the study has run + been analyzed, so the viewer renders the summary + insights. Deep dive: `ish docs get-page concepts/sharing`. (CLI-only — the MCP has no share tool yet.)

## Pitfalls

The traps that fail *silently* — wrong/empty results or wasted credits with no error explaining why. The fuller catalog (output-shape quirks, per-flag edge cases, idempotency and CLI-convenience notes) is `ish docs get-page reference/pitfalls`; skim it once before a long session.

- **Billing & the `--yes` gate**: billable verbs (`study run`, `study analyze`, `study extend`, `ask run`/`create`/`dispatch`/`add-round`/`add-questions`/`retry`) AND destructive deletes refuse without `--yes` in `--json`/piped/non-TTY context — the agent default — exiting 2 with `error_kind: "ConfirmationRequired"` and a copy-pasteable `example`. Just pass `-y`, or set `ISH_ASSUME_YES=1` ONCE to pre-authorize spending for the whole session. Credits are an allowance (paid plans refill monthly; the free tier is a one-time grant), not a per-call bill — spend them without hesitation; the gate is for human review, not frugality. The ONE exempt billable path is `ish ask create --no-dispatch` (a draft spends nothing). Quota walls (`usage_limit_reached` / `insufficient_credits`) are exit **1**, NOT exit 3 — don't re-login; the user must upgrade or free credits.
- **Cold start — the free plan caps at 1 workspace**: `workspace_create` returns `usage_limit_reached` at the cap. CLI shortcut: `ish workspace create --name <x> --ensure` (idempotent by name). MCP (no `--ensure`): `workspace_list` first; if `workspace_create` still hits the cap, re-list — another session may have created one you didn't see. Full recipe: `ish docs get-page guides/cold-start`.
- **Chat endpoints pass shallowly — validate before you trust transcripts**: `chat_endpoint_test` succeeds if the bot responds *at all*, but a wrong response path (`{data:{reply}}` vs `{reply}`) yields empty transcripts, expired `--from-curl` auth yields identical short error strings, and a 401 surfaces as "participant got stuck on the auth screen" — a config bug wearing a UX-finding costume. Inspect one full `chat_endpoint_test` response before dispatching, and never read auth/empty-reply failures as user-research data. A chat **study** also needs a default chat config first (`ish chat config set --endpoint <ep> --default`) — the endpoint says *which* bot, the config says *how* to converse; `study create --modality chat` errors without it.
- **`group_build` may return fewer profiles than requested** when the description is over-constrained. Read the returned `person_ids` count — don't trust the requested `count`.
- **Variants of wildly different length skew the pick** toward the longer one. Keep variants comparable in shape, or the winner reflects length, not preference.
- **No per-slide / per-timestamp media scoping**: there's no "evaluate just slide 14" or "react to seconds 0-30" API. State the focus in the `assignment` text, or pre-stitch the artifact (swap one slide, upload as a new iteration).
- **Don't poll a stuck run forever**: a dead worker sits in `status: running` until the backend reaper flips it to `failed` (`error_kind: stale_worker`, ~15 min). The per-participant payload exposes `age_seconds`; above ~900s on a non-terminal row the run is almost certainly dead, and the `--wait` envelope says so ("the worker likely died") — surface the failure, don't retry.

## When in doubt

`ish docs` (deep concept references, CLI-side) and live MCP tool descriptions (argument schemas, MCP-side) are closer to source-of-truth than this skill. **Trust them over this skill if they conflict.**

- **CLI present**: `ish docs overview`, `ish docs get-page concepts/run-verbs`, `ish docs get-page guides/cold-start`, `ish docs search <keyword>`.
- **MCP only**: read the tool description of the MCP tool you're about to call; cross-reference against this skill's "Shape" blocks. The MCP server's own `instructions` block (delivered automatically with the tool list) covers vocabulary and posture and is authoritative.
