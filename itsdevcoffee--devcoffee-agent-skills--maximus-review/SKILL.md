# Maximus Review Analyzer

Post-run analysis and intelligent status checking for Maximus Loop executions. Provides two modes: full review (default) for comprehensive analysis, and quick status (--quick flag) for fast progress checks.

**Announce:** "I'll analyze the Maximus Loop execution for you."

## Supporting Documentation

Load these reference files as needed:
- **Run Summary Schema:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/run-summary-schema.md` — Task outcome, cost, and performance field reference
- **Cost Estimation:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/cost-estimation.md` — Cost benchmarks and optimization analysis
- **Task API:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/task-api.md` — Visual progress tracking with TaskCreate/TaskUpdate

---

## Operating Modes

### Full Review Mode (Default)

Use when: User wants comprehensive analysis of completed or in-progress runs.

Triggers: "review the run", "analyze results", "/maximus-review"

Process: Complete 6-phase analysis with visual progress tracking.

### Quick Status Mode (--quick)

Use when: User wants fast progress check without deep analysis.

Triggers: "check status", "how is it going", "quick status", "--quick flag"

Process: Read-only snapshot with concise terminal output.

---

## Full Review Mode: 6-Phase Analysis

Create all phase tasks upfront with Task API, then execute sequentially.

### Phase 1: Read Progress

**Create Task:**
```
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Read progress metadata"
  description: "Parse .maximus/progress.md frontmatter and iteration history"
  activeForm: "Reading progress metadata"
```

**Actions:**
1. Read `.maximus/progress.md`
2. Parse YAML frontmatter: `current_iteration`, `total_tasks`, `completed_tasks`, `status`
3. Extract latest iteration entry for current state
4. Note any blockers or errors in recent iterations

**Mark completed:** `TaskUpdate: taskId "task-1", status "completed"`

---

### Phase 2: Read Run Summary

**Create Task:**
```
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Load run summary data"
  description: "Parse .maximus/run-summary.json for per-task outcomes and costs"
  activeForm: "Loading run summary data"
```

**Actions:**
1. Read `.maximus/run-summary.json`
2. Parse TaskSummaryEntry fields: `taskId`, `phase`, `feature`, `model`, `costUsd`, `durationMs`, `numTurns`, `outcome`, `timestamp`, `errorMessage`
3. Load reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/run-summary-schema.md` for field definitions
4. Build in-memory summary of outcomes: completed, failed, blocked, timeout, skipped

**Mark completed:** `TaskUpdate: taskId "task-2", status "completed"`

---

### Phase 3: Analyze Patterns

**Create Task:**
```
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Identify failure patterns and anomalies"
  description: "Detect failures, retries, timeouts, cost outliers, complexity mismatches"
  activeForm: "Analyzing patterns and anomalies"
```

**Actions:**
1. **Failure analysis:**
   - Count by `outcome`: completed, failed, blocked, timeout
   - Identify tasks with `errorMessage` and group by error type
   - Detect retry patterns (same feature name, multiple attempts)

2. **Cost analysis:**
   - Load reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/cost-estimation.md` for benchmarks
   - Calculate cost per complexity level, compare to expected:
     - Simple (haiku): Expected ~$0.32, flag if >$0.50
     - Medium (sonnet): Expected ~$2.27, flag if >$3.50
     - Complex (opus): Expected ~$5.00, flag if >$8.00
   - Identify top 5 most expensive tasks

3. **Complexity mismatch detection:**
   - Haiku tasks with >5 files changed → should be medium
   - Haiku tasks with `numTurns` >8 → likely too complex
   - Timeout tasks (durationMs = 900,000ms) → should be split

4. **Performance patterns:**
   - Average `durationMs` per complexity level
   - Outlier detection: tasks >2x average duration for their complexity
   - High turn count (numTurns >15) indicates task complexity underestimation

**Mark completed:** `TaskUpdate: taskId "task-3", status "completed"`

---

### Phase 4: Review Code (Optional)

**Create Task:**
```
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Review code changes"
  description: "Optionally check files changed during the run via git diff"
  activeForm: "Reviewing code changes"
```

**Actions:**
1. Ask user: "Would you like me to review the code changes made during this run?"
2. If yes:
   - Run `git diff <starting-commit>..HEAD --stat` to see changed files
   - For critical files, run `git diff <starting-commit>..HEAD <file-path>` to see changes
   - Check for common issues: missing tests, hardcoded values, security concerns
3. If no: Skip to Phase 5

**Mark completed:** `TaskUpdate: taskId "task-4", status "completed"`

---

### Phase 5: Generate Report

**Create Task:**
```
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Generate structured findings report"
  description: "Create report with severity levels and actionable insights"
  activeForm: "Generating findings report"
```

**Report Structure:**

```markdown
# Maximus Loop Run Review

## Summary
- Total Tasks: X
- Completed: X (Y%)
- Failed: X
- Blocked: X
- Timeout: X
- Total Cost: $X.XX
- Total Duration: Xm Ys
- Success Rate: Y%

## Cost Breakdown
| Complexity | Count | Total Cost | Avg Cost | Expected Avg |
|-----------|-------|------------|----------|--------------|
| Simple    | X     | $X.XX      | $X.XX    | $0.32        |
| Medium    | X     | $X.XX      | $X.XX    | $2.27        |
| Complex   | X     | $X.XX      | $X.XX    | $5.00        |

## Issues

- [List critical issues: timeouts, repeated failures, major cost overruns]

### 🟡 Warning
- [List warnings: minor cost outliers, complexity mismatches, high turn counts]

### 🔵 Info
- [List informational findings: performance trends, optimization opportunities]

## Top 5 Most Expensive Tasks
1. Task #X ($X.XX): [feature] — [reason if outlier]
2. ...

## Failed Tasks Detail
[For each failed task, show: taskId, feature, error message, cost wasted]

## Recommendations
- [Actionable suggestions based on patterns]
- [Complexity level adjustments for future runs]
- [Task splitting recommendations for timeouts]
```

**Severity Levels:**
- **Critical (🔴):** Blocking issues that prevent completion
  - Timeouts (durationMs = 900,000ms)
  - Repeated failures on same task (>2 attempts)
  - Cost >3x expected for complexity level
- **Warning (🟡):** Issues that reduce efficiency
  - Cost >1.5x expected
  - High turn counts (numTurns >10 for simple, >15 for medium)
  - Complexity mismatches (haiku failing multi-file)
- **Info (🔵):** Optimization opportunities
  - Tasks that could be simpler complexity
  - Performance trends worth noting

**Mark completed:** `TaskUpdate: taskId "task-5", status "completed"`

---

### Phase 6: Propose Follow-up

**Create Task:**
```
TaskCreate:
  subject: "Propose follow-up actions"
  description: "Suggest plan extensions or task fixes with user approval"
  activeForm: "Proposing follow-up actions"
```

**Actions:**
1. Based on findings, propose:
   - Retry failed tasks with complexity adjustments
   - Split timeout tasks into smaller subtasks
   - Extend plan with missing test coverage
   - Add documentation tasks for undocumented features

2. Present as actionable commands:
   ```
   Suggested next steps:

   1. Retry Task #X with medium complexity:
      maximus retry 5 --complexity medium

   2. Split Task #Y (timeout) into 3 subtasks:
      Use /maximus-plan to add:
        - Task A: [specific subtask]
        - Task B: [specific subtask]
        - Task C: [specific subtask]

   3. Extend plan with test coverage:
      Use /maximus-plan to add Phase N+1 testing tasks
   ```

3. Ask: "Would you like me to help implement any of these suggestions?"

4. If user approves, use `/maximus-plan` skill to extend the plan

**Mark completed:** `TaskUpdate: taskId "task-6", status "completed"`

---

## Quick Status Mode

When user triggers with "--quick" flag or status phrases ("check status", "how is it going"):

**Process (No Task API):**

1. **Read Progress:**
   - Parse `.maximus/progress.md` frontmatter only
   - Get: `current_iteration`, `total_tasks`, `completed_tasks`, `status`

2. **Read Run Summary:**
   - Parse `.maximus/run-summary.json`
   - Count outcomes, sum costs, calculate duration

3. **Calculate Metrics:**
   - Completion percentage: `(completed_tasks / total_tasks) * 100`
   - Total cost so far: sum of all `costUsd`
   - Average task duration: sum(`durationMs`) / count
   - ETA: `(total_tasks - completed_tasks) * avg_duration`
   - Warnings: count of failed, blocked, timeout outcomes

4. **Output Concise Summary:**
   ```
   Maximus Loop Status

   Progress: 7/10 tasks (70%)
   Cost: $12.45 (Est. total: ~$17.50)
   ETA: ~8 minutes remaining

   Status: ✓ Running smoothly

   Warnings:
   - 1 task timed out (Task #5)
   - 1 task blocked (Task #8)

   Use '/maximus-review' for full analysis.
   ```

**No follow-up actions** — this mode is read-only and concise.

## Task API Integration

### Full Review Setup (Before Phase 1)

Create all 6 phase tasks upfront:

```
Announce: "Running 6-phase analysis: Progress → Summary → Patterns → Code Review → Report → Follow-up"

TaskCreate:
  subject: "Read progress metadata"
  description: "Parse .maximus/progress.md frontmatter and iteration history"
  activeForm: "Reading progress metadata"

TaskCreate:
  subject: "Load run summary data"
  description: "Parse .maximus/run-summary.json for per-task outcomes"
  activeForm: "Loading run summary data"

TaskCreate:
  subject: "Identify failure patterns"
  description: "Detect failures, retries, timeouts, cost outliers"
  activeForm: "Analyzing patterns and anomalies"

TaskCreate:
  subject: "Review code changes"
  description: "Optionally check files changed via git diff"
  activeForm: "Reviewing code changes"

TaskCreate:
  subject: "Generate findings report"
  description: "Create structured report with severity levels"
  activeForm: "Generating findings report"

TaskCreate:
  subject: "Propose follow-up actions"
  description: "Suggest plan extensions or task fixes"
  activeForm: "Proposing follow-up actions"
```

### Execution Pattern

For each phase:
1. `TaskUpdate: taskId "task-N", status "in_progress"`
2. Execute phase work
3. `TaskUpdate: taskId "task-N", status "completed"`
4. Move to next phase

### Quick Status Mode (No Task API)

Quick mode skips Task API entirely — no TaskCreate or TaskUpdate calls. Just read files, calculate metrics, and output concise summary.

---

## Reference File Usage

### When to Load References

- **run-summary-schema.md:** Load during Phase 2 (Read Run Summary) to understand TaskSummaryEntry fields
- **cost-estimation.md:** Load during Phase 3 (Analyze Patterns) for cost benchmarks and complexity expectations
- **task-api.md:** Reference during setup for Task API usage patterns (already loaded in this skill)

### How to Reference

Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/` path prefix:
```
Read: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/run-summary-schema.md
```

---

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Create all 6 tasks upfront in Full Review mode
- Mark tasks `in_progress` immediately before starting
- Mark tasks `completed` immediately after finishing
- Use Quick Status for fast checks without deep analysis
- Load cost-estimation.md to validate expected vs actual costs
- Provide actionable recommendations, not just observations

**Don't:**
- Skip Task API in Full Review mode
- Create tasks incrementally (create all upfront)
- Batch multiple phase completions (mark each immediately)
- Modify `.maximus/plan.json` or `.maximus/progress.md` (engine-managed)
- Generate reports in Quick Status mode (concise terminal output only)

---

## Common Use Cases

### "How's my run going?"
→ Use Quick Status mode (phases 1-3 only, concise output)

### "Review the completed run"
→ Use Full Review mode (all 6 phases, detailed report)

### "What went wrong?"
→ Use Full Review mode, focus on Phase 3 (patterns) and Phase 5 (report)

### "Should I retry failed tasks?"
→ Use Full Review mode through Phase 6 (propose follow-up)

### "How much did this cost?"
→ Use Quick Status for fast answer, or Full Review Phase 5 for detailed breakdown

---

## Error Handling

**If `.maximus/progress.md` is missing:**
- Inform user: "No progress file found. Has the engine run yet?"
- Suggest: "Use '/maximus-plan' to create a plan first."

**If `.maximus/run-summary.json` is missing:**
- Inform user: "No run summary found. The engine may not have started yet."
- Can still read progress.md for basic status

**If run is currently active:**
- Check `.maximus/.heartbeat` timestamp
- If <30 seconds old: "Engine is currently running. Status may be incomplete."
- Proceed with available data, note incompleteness

---

## Example Workflows

### Full Review After Completion

1. User: "Review the run results"
2. Create 6 phase tasks
3. Execute phases 1-6 sequentially
4. Generate detailed report
5. Propose follow-up actions
6. Ask if user wants help implementing suggestions

### Quick Status During Execution

1. User: "Check status"
2. Read progress.md (current state)
3. Read run-summary.json (completed tasks)
4. Calculate completion %, cost, ETA
5. Output concise 5-line summary
6. Done (no follow-up)

### Cost Analysis Focus

1. User: "Why was this so expensive?"
2. Create 6 phase tasks
3. Execute Phase 1-3 (focus on Phase 3 cost analysis)
4. Load cost-estimation.md for benchmarks
5. In Phase 5 report, highlight cost outliers with explanations
6. In Phase 6, suggest complexity adjustments for future runs
