description: Validate a Maximus Loop project configuration. Run deterministic CLI checks and provide project-aware advisories. Use when the user asks to "validate maximus", "check maximus config", "verify maximus setup", "is my maximus config correct", "is my project ready to run", "lint my config", or before running the engine. Use when this capability is needed.

# Maximus Validate — Configuration Validator

Validate the Maximus Loop project configuration by running deterministic CLI checks and providing project-aware advisories.

**Announce:** "I'll validate your Maximus Loop configuration and check for potential issues."

## Phase 1: Run CLI Validation

Run the `maximus validate` CLI command with JSON output:

```bash
maximus validate --json
```

Parse the JSON result. The output has this structure:
```json
{
  "valid": true|false,
  "checks": [{ "name": "...", "status": "pass|fail|warn", "message": "..." }],
  "config_summary": { "project_name": "...", "default_model": "...", ... } | null
}
```

**If all checks pass with no failures:** Proceed to Phase 2 for advisories.

**If any checks fail:** Present the failures clearly:
```
Validation Failures:
  ✗ [check.message for each failed check]
```

If the user asks to fix issues, apply targeted fixes. Otherwise, report only.

---

## Phase 2: Project-Aware Analysis

This phase adds intelligence on top of the CLI's deterministic checks. Read project files and compare against the config.

### Advisories to check (only report if relevant):

1. **Timeout vs project size:**
   - Count files: `find . -type f -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './.git/*' -not -path './dist/*' -not -path './build/*' -not -path './.next/*' -not -path './vendor/*' | wc -l`
   - Small (<100 files): 600s is fine, 900+ may be excessive
   - Medium (100–500): 900s recommended
   - Large (500+): 1200s recommended
   - Report if timeout seems mismatched

2. **Context files:**
   - Check if `context.files` includes `CLAUDE.md` (if one exists in the project)
   - Check if referenced context files actually exist

3. **Escalation status:**
   - If escalation is disabled but plan has tasks with `complexity_level`, note the mismatch

4. **Commit prefix vs git log:**
   - First check `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` — skip this advisory if not a git repo or has no commits
   - Run `git log --oneline -5` and compare against `git.commit_prefix`
   - If prefix doesn't match recent commit style, note it (informational only)

5. **Plan health:**
   - If plan has tasks, report completion status (X/Y completed, Z pending)
   - If all tasks are complete, suggest creating a new plan

### Output format:

**If advisories found:**
```
Advisories:
  • [advisory description]
  • [advisory description]
```

**If no advisories:** Skip this section entirely. Don't pad the output.

## Phase 3: Present Findings

Combine CLI results and advisories into a clear summary.

**Valid with no advisories:**
```
✓ Configuration is valid

Configuration:
  Project:      [name]
  Model:        [model] (escalation: [status])
  Timeout:      [N]s
  Iterations:   [N]
  Auto-commit:  [yes/no] (prefix: "[prefix]")
  Auto-push:    [yes/no]

Ready to run: maximus run
```

**Valid with advisories:**
```
✓ Configuration is valid (with advisories)

[Config summary as above]

Advisories:
  • [list]
```

**Invalid:**
```
✗ Configuration has errors

Failures:
  ✗ [list]

[Advisories if any]

Fix the failures above, then re-run /maximus-validate.
```

---

## Constraints

- **Read-only by default.** Do NOT write files unless the user explicitly asks to fix something.
- **CLI facts vs skill advisories:** Always distinguish between what the CLI reported (deterministic) and what you observed (advisory). Never mix them.
- **Short output when valid:** If everything passes with no advisories, keep it brief. Don't pad.
- **Config schema reference:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/maximus-validate/references/config-schema.md`
