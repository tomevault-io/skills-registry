# Beads Integration Skill

## Overview

Beads is a git-backed issue tracker for multi-session work with dependencies and persistent memory. All tasks stored in `.beads/` directory as markdown files, committed to git, surviving conversation compaction.

**Key Capabilities:** Task creation/management, status transitions, comments, dependencies, git worktree integration, synchronization.

**Reference:** See k2-dev-reference.md#beads-cli-commands for complete command syntax.

## Core Concepts

### Task Structure
- **ID**: beads-{number}
- **Title**: Short description
- **Description**: Detailed requirements and context
- **Status**: open, in_progress, blocked, closed
- **Priority**: P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low)
- **Comments**: Discussion and updates
- **Dependencies**: Relationships between tasks

### Git-Backed Storage
- Stored in `.beads/` as markdown
- Committed to git for persistence
- Survives conversation compaction
- Shareable across team
- Full history via git log

## K2-Dev Workflow Integration

### Reading Task Context (Before Implementation)

```bash
bd show beads-123              # Task details
bd comments beads-123          # All comments for context
bd dep list beads-123          # Check dependencies
```

**Parse output for:**
- Title and description (requirements)
- Current status and priority
- Plan and implementation notes in comments
- Blocking dependencies

### Creating Tasks from Plans (Planner Agent)

```bash
# Epic
bd create "User Authentication System" -d "Epic description" -p P1

# Stories under epic
bd create "JWT Token Implementation" -d "Story" -p P1 --parent=beads-{epic}

# Subtasks
bd create "Auth middleware" -d "Subtask" -p P2 --parent=beads-{story}

# Dependencies (B blocks on A - A must complete before B)
bd dep add beads-{B} --blocks-on=beads-{A}
```

### Adding Implementation Context (Technical Lead)

```bash
bd comments beads-123 add "Implementation Plan:
1. Create middleware in src/auth/
2. Use existing JWT library
3. Follow patterns in AGENTS.md
4. Add tests in tests/auth/"
```

### Status Transitions

**Proper workflow:**
```bash
# Technical Lead assigns to Engineer
bd update beads-123 --status in_progress --assignee engineer

# After implementation
bd update beads-123 --status closed

# If blocked
bd update beads-123 --status blocked
bd comments beads-123 add "Blocked by: beads-120 needs merge first"
```

### Creating Follow-Up Tickets (After Review)

When review identifies issues beyond 2 iterations:

```bash
# Critical issues
bd create "Fix authentication bypass vulnerability" \
  -d "Critical security issue from PR #456 review. Details: [...]" \
  -p P0

# Link to original
bd comments beads-789 add "Follow-up ticket created: beads-790 (P0)"
bd comments beads-790 add "Follow-up from: beads-789"
```

## Best Practices

### Task Descriptions

**Good:**
```
Implement JWT authentication middleware

Acceptance Criteria:
- Validates JWT tokens on protected routes
- Returns 401 for invalid/expired tokens
- Follows patterns in src/auth/oauth.ts
- Test coverage >80%

Related: beads-120 (API refactor)
```

**Bad:**
```
Add auth stuff
```

### Comments

Use comments for:
- Implementation plans and notes
- Progress updates
- Blockers and resolutions
- Review feedback summary
- Links to PRs and commits

### Dependencies

Set dependencies to:
- Prevent starting work too early
- Show task relationships
- Enable parallel work where possible
- Communicate workflow order

### Synchronization

Always sync after:
- Creating or closing tasks
- Session end (automated via hook)
- Before generating reports
- After significant updates

```bash
bd sync
```

## Task Hierarchies

**Epic** (1-2 weeks): `bd create "User Management System" -d "Complete user CRUD with roles" -p P1`
**Story** (2-5 days): `bd create "User Profile Editing" -d "Users can edit profile" -p P1 --parent=beads-{epic}`
**Subtask** (0.5-2 days): `bd create "Profile API endpoint" -d "Create PUT /api/users/:id" -p P2 --parent=beads-{story}`

Link with dependencies to show hierarchy.

## Troubleshooting

**Task Not Found:**
```bash
bd sync                    # Sync first
bd list                    # List all
bd search "keyword"        # Search
```

**Status Not Updating:**
- Check for unsaved changes in editor
- Check git conflicts in .beads/
- Run bd sync

**Dependency Cycles:**
```bash
# Check before adding to avoid cycles
bd dep list beads-123
bd dep list beads-456
```

## Git Worktree Integration

```bash
bd worktree create beads-123    # Creates ../beads-123/, branch feature/beads-123
bd worktree list                # List worktrees
bd worktree remove beads-123    # Remove worktree
```

**Reference:** See git-worktree-workflow skill for detailed patterns.

## Agent-Specific Usage

**Technical Lead:**
- Validates tickets exist and are open
- Reads task context for planning (bd show, bd comments)
- Adds architectural notes as comments
- Closes tasks after merge
- Syncs beads at end

**Engineer:**
- Reads task description and comments for requirements
- Checks dependencies before starting
- Updates status during implementation
- Creates follow-up tickets when needed

**Planner:**
- Creates hierarchical task structures
- Sets up dependencies
- Writes detailed descriptions
- Links related tasks

**Reviewer:**
- Reads task context for review
- Does NOT add comments to beads (uses GitHub PR instead)
- May recommend follow-up tickets

**Tester:**
- Reads requirements from beads
- Adds test plan as comment
- References beads ticket in test documentation

**Reference:** See k2-dev-reference.md for complete command syntax, priority levels, and task granularity guidelines.
