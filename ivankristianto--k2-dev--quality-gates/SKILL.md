# Quality Gates Skill

## Overview

Quality gates are project-defined standards that all code changes must meet. In k2-dev, gates are defined in three configuration files at project root and enforced throughout the development workflow.

**Configuration Files:**
- **AGENTS.md** - Quality standards, file validation patterns, agent guidelines
- **constitution.md** - Core principles and immutable constraints

**Reference:** See k2-dev-reference.md#quality-standards-files for overview.

## Core Concepts

### What are Quality Gates?

Checkpoints code must pass before progressing:
- **Type checking:** No TypeScript errors
- **Test coverage:** Minimum percentage coverage
- **Linting:** Code style compliance
- **Security:** No known vulnerabilities
- **Performance:** Acceptable metrics
- **Documentation:** Required comments/docs

### Why Quality Gates?

**Consistency:** Uniform code quality across team
**Standards:** Enforce project-specific patterns
**Prevention:** Catch issues before review
**Automation:** Reduce manual review burden
**Documentation:** Codify team agreements

### Enforcement Points

1. **Engineer self-review** before creating PR
2. **PreToolUse hook** before file changes
3. **Reviewer validation** during code review
4. **CI/CD pipeline** automated checks

## Configuration Files

### AGENTS.md Structure

Located at project root, defines:
- Quality gate thresholds (type checking, test coverage, linting)
- File validation patterns (which files trigger validation)
- Coding standards and review criteria
- Agent behavioral guidelines

**Example sections:**
```markdown
## Quality Gates
- Type Checking: All TypeScript files must pass `tsc --noEmit`
- Test Coverage: Minimum 80% line coverage
- Linting: ESLint must pass
- Security: OWASP Top 10 compliance

## File Validation Patterns
Validate: `src/**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.tsx`, `lib/**/*.js`
Skip: `**/*.test.ts`, `docs/**/*`, `*.md`

## Code Review Standards
Blocking: Security vulnerabilities, logic errors, performance regressions
Non-Blocking: Style preferences, naming suggestions, refactoring opportunities
```

### AGENTS.md Structure

Located at project root, defines all quality standards:
- Quality gate thresholds (type checking, test coverage, linting)
- File validation patterns (which files trigger validation)
- Coding standards and review criteria
- Agent behavioral guidelines
- Project-specific patterns and conventions

**Example sections:**

Defines immutable principles:
- Core project values
- Non-negotiable constraints
- Architectural decisions
- Security policies
- Compliance requirements

**Example:**
```markdown
## Core Principles
- Security First: Never compromise security for convenience
- User Privacy: GDPR compliance mandatory
- Performance: API response time <200ms (p95)

## Non-Negotiable Constraints
1. All passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor ≥12)
2. HTTPS only in production
3. Rate limiting on all public endpoints
```

## Reading Configuration Files

### Before Starting Work

All agents must read configuration:

```bash
# Check files exist
ls -la AGENTS.md constitution.md

# Read files
cat AGENTS.md
cat constitution.md
```

**Parse for:**
- Quality gate thresholds
- File validation patterns
- Required checks
- Architectural patterns
- Security requirements
- Testing standards

### During Implementation

Reference configuration throughout:
- Check patterns before implementing
- Validate approach against architecture
- Ensure compliance with constraints
- Follow coding standards

### Before Self-Review

Engineer validates against both files:
- AGENTS.md quality gates and patterns
- constitution.md principles

## Validation Workflow

### Engineer Self-Review Checklist

**From AGENTS.md:**
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Test coverage meets threshold
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Security checks pass
- [ ] File patterns match
- [ ] Follows project architecture
- [ ] Uses preferred libraries
- [ ] Matches coding patterns
- [ ] Proper file organization

**From constitution.md:**
- [ ] Upholds core principles
- [ ] Respects constraints
- [ ] Security policies followed
- [ ] Performance requirements met

### Reviewer Validation

Reviewer checks compliance:

```bash
# Read configuration
cat AGENTS.md constitution.md

# Review changes
git diff main...feature/beads-123

# Validate specific checks
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm test -- --coverage
```

**Validation categories:**
- **P0 (Critical):** Security, data loss, breaking changes
- **P1 (Important):** Quality gates, architecture violations
- **P2 (Minor):** Style issues, optimization opportunities

**Reference:** See k2-dev-reference.md#review-severity-levels

### PreToolUse Hook Validation

Hook validates before Write/Edit operations:

```bash
# Check if file matches validation patterns from AGENTS.md
# If match, run quality checks
# Block operation if checks fail
```

Validates:
- File matches pattern (e.g., `src/**/*.ts`)
- Type checking passes
- Linting passes
- No security violations

## Quality Gate Examples

### Type Checking

**Standard:** All TypeScript must type-check
**Validation:** `tsc --noEmit`
**Pass:** No errors | **Fail:** Any type errors

### Test Coverage

**Standard:** Minimum 80% coverage (from AGENTS.md)
**Validation:** `npm test -- --coverage`
**Pass:** ≥80% line coverage | **Fail:** <80%

### Linting

**Standard:** ESLint must pass
**Validation:** `npm run lint`
**Pass:** No errors | **Fail:** Any linting errors

### Security

**Standard:** No hardcoded secrets (constitution.md), input validation required (AGENTS.md)
**Validation:**
```bash
git diff | grep -E '(api_key|password|secret)'  # Check for secrets
grep -r "req.body" src/api/                     # Review for input validation
```
**Pass:** No secrets, all inputs validated | **Fail:** Secrets found, missing validation

## Handling Quality Gate Failures

### During Self-Review

If quality gates fail:
1. Identify which check failed
2. Fix root cause
3. Re-validate
4. Repeat until all gates pass
5. Document any challenges in PR

### During Review

If Reviewer finds issues:

**Iteration 1:**
- Reviewer provides specific feedback
- Engineer fixes issues
- Re-review

**Iteration 2:**
- Reviewer re-checks fixes
- If passes, approve
- If fails, create follow-up tickets

**Follow-up tickets:**
- P0: Critical issues blocking merge
- P1: Important issues for next sprint
- P2: Minor improvements for backlog

### PreToolUse Hook Blocks

If hook blocks operation:
1. Read error message (understand what failed)
2. Check AGENTS.md (review validation patterns)
3. Fix issue (address root cause)
4. Retry operation (should now pass)

**Example:**
```bash
# Hook blocks Write operation
Error: Type checking failed for src/auth.ts

# Fix type errors
vi src/auth.ts

# Retry - should succeed now
```

## Best Practices

### DO
✅ Read configuration first: `cat AGENTS.md constitution.md`
✅ Validate early and often during implementation
✅ Understand rationale for each standard
✅ Ask for clarification if standard is unclear
✅ Document exceptions with rationale and mitigation

### DON'T
❌ Skip reading AGENTS.md, constitution.md
❌ Bypass quality gates (disable checks, commit --no-verify, merge failing PRs)
❌ Ignore warnings (address linting warnings, test failures, type errors)
❌ Negotiate immutable constraints (constitution.md is non-negotiable)

## Project Configuration Templates

If AGENTS.md doesn't exist, suggest creating:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md Template

## Quality Gates
- Type Checking: `npm run type-check` - Must pass
- Test Coverage: `npm test -- --coverage` - Threshold: 80%
- Linting: `npm run lint` - Must pass

## File Validation Patterns
Validate: `src/**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.tsx`
Skip: `**/*.test.ts`, `docs/**/*`

## Review Standards
Blocking: Security vulnerabilities, logic errors
Non-Blocking: Style preferences
```

## Integration with K2-Dev Workflow

**Technical Lead:**
- Reads configuration before planning
- Validates approach against architecture
- Ensures quality gates are clear

**Engineer:**
- Reads configuration at start
- Validates during implementation
- Self-reviews against both files
- Only creates PR when all gates pass

**Reviewer:**
- Validates against AGENTS.md standards
- Ensures constitution.md principles upheld
- Categorizes issues by severity (P0/P1/P2)

**Planner:**
- References configuration during planning
- Ensures plans comply with architecture
- Considers quality gate requirements

Follow quality gates rigorously to maintain code quality and project standards throughout the k2-dev development lifecycle.
