# Material Thinking

Apply Material Design 3 and M3 Expressive principles to create accessible, consistent, and engaging user interfaces.

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for implementing Material Design 3 (M3) and M3 Expressive across all platforms. Material Design 3 is Google's open-source design system that provides UX guidance, reusable components, and design tools for creating beautiful, accessible interfaces.

**Key capabilities:**
- Design new products with M3 principles
- Review existing designs for M3 compliance
- Generate design tokens (colors, typography, shapes)
- Apply M3 Expressive for engaging, emotionally resonant UIs
- Select appropriate components for specific use cases
- Ensure accessibility and responsive design

## Core Resources

This skill includes four comprehensive reference documents. Read these as needed during your work:

### 1. Foundations (`references/foundations.md`)
Read when working with:
- Accessibility requirements
- Layout and responsive design (window size classes, canonical layouts)
- Interaction patterns (states, gestures, selection)
- Content design and UX writing
- Design tokens and adaptive design

### 2. Styles (`references/styles.md`)
Read when working with:
- Color systems (dynamic color, color roles, tonal palettes)
- Typography (type scale, fonts)
- Elevation and depth
- Shapes and corner radius
- Icons (Material Symbols)
- Motion and transitions

### 3. Components (`references/components.md`)
Read when selecting or implementing:
- Action components (buttons, FAB, segmented buttons)
- Selection and input (checkbox, radio, switch, text fields, chips)
- Navigation (nav bar, drawer, rail, app bars, tabs)
- Containment and layout (cards, lists, carousel, sheets)
- Communication (dialogs, snackbar, badges, progress, tooltips, menus)

### 4. M3 Expressive (`references/m3-expressive.md`)
Read when creating more engaging experiences:
- Expressive motion tactics
- Shape morphing
- Dynamic animations
- Brand expression
- Balancing expressiveness with usability

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Designing a New Interface

When designing a new product or feature with Material 3:

1. **Define layout structure**
   - Read `references/foundations.md` → Layout section
   - Determine window size classes (compact/medium/expanded)
   - Choose canonical layout if applicable (list-detail, feed, supporting pane)

2. **Select components**
   - Read `references/components.md`
   - Use Component Selection Guide to choose appropriate components
   - Review specific component guidelines for usage and specs

3. **Establish visual style**
   - Read `references/styles.md`
   - Define color scheme (dynamic or static)
   - Set typography scale
   - Choose shape scale (corner radius values)
   - Plan motion and transitions

4. **Apply M3 Expressive (optional)**
   - Read `references/m3-expressive.md`
   - Identify key moments for expressive design
   - Apply emphasized easing and extended durations
   - Consider shape morphing for transitions
   - Follow 80/20 rule (80% standard, 20% expressive)

5. **Validate accessibility**
   - Read `references/foundations.md` → Accessibility section
   - Check color contrast (WCAG compliance)
   - Verify touch targets (minimum 48×48dp)
   - Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Workflow 2: Reviewing Existing Designs

When reviewing designs for Material 3 compliance:

1. **Component compliance**
   - Read `references/components.md` for relevant components
   - Check if components follow M3 specifications
   - Verify proper component usage (e.g., not using filled buttons excessively)
   - Validate component states (enabled, hover, focus, pressed, disabled)

2. **Visual consistency**
   - Read `references/styles.md`
   - Verify color roles are used correctly
   - Check typography matches type scale
   - Validate elevation levels
   - Review shape consistency (corner radius)

3. **Accessibility audit**
   - Read `references/foundations.md` → Accessibility section
   - Test color contrast ratios
   - Check touch target sizes
   - Verify text resizing support
   - Review focus indicators

4. **Interaction patterns**
   - Read `references/foundations.md` → Interaction section
   - Verify state layers are present
   - Check gesture support for mobile
   - Validate selection patterns

### Workflow 3: Generating Design Tokens

When creating design tokens for a new theme:

1. **Color tokens**
   - Read `references/styles.md` → Color section
   - Choose color scheme type (dynamic or static)
   - Define source color(s)
   - Generate tonal palette (13 tones per key color)
   - Map color roles (primary, secondary, tertiary, surface, error)
   - Create light and dark theme variants

2. **Typography tokens**
   - Read `references/styles.md` → Typography section
   - Select font family
   - Define type scale (display, headline, title, body, label × small/medium/large)
   - Set letter spacing and line height

3. **Shape tokens**
   - Read `references/styles.md` → Shape section
   - Define corner radius scale (none, extra-small, small, medium, large, extra-large)
   - Map shapes to component categories

4. **Motion tokens**
   - Read `references/styles.md` → Motion section
   - Define duration values (short, medium, long)
   - Set easing curves (emphasized, standard)
   - For M3 Expressive, read `references/m3-expressive.md` → Expressive Motion

### Workflow 4: Implementing M3 Expressive

When adding expressive elements to enhance engagement:

1. **Identify key moments**
   - Onboarding flows
   - Primary user actions (FAB, main CTAs)
   - Screen transitions
   - Success/completion states

2. **Apply expressive tactics**
   - Read `references/m3-expressive.md` → Design Tactics
   - Use emphasized easing for important transitions
   - Extend animation durations (400-700ms)
   - Add exaggerated scale changes
   - Implement layered/staggered animations
   - Consider shape morphing

3. **Balance with usability**
   - Follow 80/20 rule (most interactions remain standard)
   - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
   - Avoid excessive motion in productivity contexts
   - Test on lower-end devices

- Level 1: 1dp (cards)
- Level 2: 3dp (search bars)
- Level 3: 6dp (FAB)
- Level 5: 12dp (modals, dialogs)

## Best Practices

### General Principles

1. **Consistency**: Use design tokens consistently across the product
2. **Hierarchy**: Establish clear visual hierarchy through size, color, and spacing
3. **Accessibility**: Always meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (minimum)
4. **Responsiveness**: Design for all window size classes
5. **Platform conventions**: Respect platform-specific patterns when appropriate

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too many filled buttons**: Use only one filled button per screen for primary action
- **Ignoring window size classes**: Design must adapt to different screen sizes
- **Poor color contrast**: Always validate contrast ratios
- **Inconsistent spacing**: Use 4dp grid system throughout
- **Overusing M3 Expressive**: Keep 80% standard, 20% expressive
- **Small touch targets**: Minimum 48×48dp for all interactive elements
- **Unclear component states**: All components must show hover, focus, pressed states

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Flutter:**
- Use Material 3 theme in `ThemeData(useMaterial3: true)`
- Access design tokens via `Theme.of(context)`
- Official documentation: https://m3.material.io/develop/flutter

**Android (Jetpack Compose):**
- Use Material3 package
- MaterialTheme provides M3 components and tokens
- Official documentation: https://m3.material.io/develop/android/jetpack-compose

**Web:**
- Use Material Web Components library
- CSS custom properties for design tokens
- Official documentation: https://m3.material.io/develop/web

**Platform-agnostic:**
- Export design tokens from Material Theme Builder
- Apply M3 principles manually to any framework
