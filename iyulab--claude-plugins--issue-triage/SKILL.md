# Issue & PR Triage Framework

Evaluate external Issues/PRs against project philosophy. The goal is not just to decide on the request — it's to **discover latent work** the request reveals.

## Core Philosophy

- **"Every issue is an opportunity"** — Even declines improve documentation or reveal API gaps.
- **"Think 10 from 1"** — One request implies ten insights. What's missing? What should change?
- **"Every contribution is a gift"** — Honor the contributor's time.
- **"Mentor, not gatekeeper"** — Help them succeed.

## Philosophy Alignment

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Core Mission Fit | Serves project's core purpose? |
| Scope Alignment | Library vs application responsibility? |
| Pattern Consistency | Consistent with existing architecture? |
| User Base Impact | Benefits majority or niche? |

**Overall**: High (4-5 avg) / Medium (3-3.9) / Low (1-2.9)

## Issue Decision Matrix

```
                 | Philosophy HIGH | Philosophy LOW  |
-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
Feasibility HIGH | ACCEPT          | REDIRECT        |
Feasibility MED  | ADAPT           | DEFER/REDIRECT  |
Feasibility LOW  | DEFER           | DECLINE         |
```

## PR Decision Matrix

```
                 | Quality HIGH         | Quality LOW          |
-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
Philosophy HIGH  | APPROVE              | MERGE_WITH_FIXES     |
Philosophy MED   | APPROVE_WITH_NOTES   | REQUEST_CHANGES      |
Philosophy LOW   | REDIRECT             | DECLINE              |
```
