description: Use this skill when refactoring Rust code in the koan repo — renaming symbols across the crate, moving items between files/modules, extracting a function or sub-module, applying batch structural search-and-replace, pruning unused code, or auto-fixing compiler/clippy diagnostics. Pairs `ast-grep` for structural rewrites, `cargo clippy --fix` / `cargo fix` for lint-driven cleanup, and `cargo build` as the verification step.

# rust-refactor

Command-line workflow for Rust refactors in the koan repo. Three tools, in order of trust:

1. **`cargo build` / `cargo clippy`** — the compiler is the source of truth.
2. **`cargo fix` / `cargo clippy --fix`** — auto-apply suggestions the compiler already knows about.
3. **`ast-grep`** — pattern-based structural rewrites for things the compiler can't do alone (renames, moves, signature reshapes).

Assumes `ast-grep` and `cargo clippy` are on PATH. For *scoring* a proposed module reshuffle (partition / rename / split) before doing it, see the dedicated `modgraph` skill. For deciding *what to extract* and *what shape it should take* before performing the move — recognizing seams, choosing between a struct/enum/iterator/classifier, and avoiding empty wrapper types — see the dedicated `rust-abstraction` skill. When the refactor is done, run the `verify` skill to confirm tests + clippy are clean and to record the new modgraph score against the prior baseline — that's the single check that proves the refactor didn't regress anything.

## When to reach for which tool

| Situation | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Compiler or clippy emitted a fixable suggestion | `cargo fix` / `cargo clippy --fix` |
| Same syntactic pattern appears in many places | `ast-grep` (with `--rewrite` for SSR) |
| Renaming a symbol across the crate | `ast-grep` + `cargo build` |
| Moving an item between files/modules | move by hand, then `cargo build` + `cargo fix` |
| Anything touching types, lifetimes, or trait bounds | finish with `cargo build` to verify |
| Considering a module split / merge / rename, or scoring a partition reshuffle | see the `modgraph` skill |

## Recipes

### 1. Apply compiler and lint suggestions

```sh
cargo fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged           # rustc suggestions
cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged  # clippy suggestions
cargo build                                       # verify
```

Commit between the two `--fix` passes so each diff is reviewable on its own.

### 2. Find every call site of a symbol

```sh
ast-grep --lang rust --pattern 'foo($$$ARGS)'    # function calls
ast-grep --lang rust --pattern '$X.foo($$$ARGS)' # method calls
ast-grep --lang rust --pattern 'use $$$::foo'    # imports
```

`$$$NAME` matches a list of nodes (zero or more); `$NAME` matches a single node. Scope with a path (e.g. `ast-grep ... src/parse/`) when the same name might mean different things in different modules.

### 3. Rename a symbol across the crate

```sh
# Preview first — no --update-all means no writes.
ast-grep --lang rust --pattern 'old_name' --rewrite 'new_name'

# Apply.
ast-grep --lang rust --pattern 'old_name' --rewrite 'new_name' --update-all
cargo build
```

For renames that also reshape args, use metavariables: `--pattern 'old_name($A, $B)' --rewrite 'new_name($B)'`.

### 4. Move an item from one file to another

1. Confirm the definition: `ast-grep --lang rust --pattern '<item-signature>'`.
2. Find references using the patterns from recipe 2.
3. Cut the item, paste it into the new file. Add `pub` if it now crosses a module boundary.
4. `cargo build`. The "unresolved import" / "cannot find … in this scope" errors are the worklist.
5. `cargo fix --allow-dirty` resolves many of those automatically.
6. Re-run `cargo build` and `cargo clippy` to confirm clean.

### 5. Structural pattern rewrite

Example: convert free-function `foo(x, y)` into method-call `x.foo(y)` across the crate.

```sh
ast-grep --lang rust \
  --pattern 'foo($X, $Y)' \
  --rewrite '$X.foo($Y)' \
  --update-all
cargo build
```

Always preview without `--update-all` first — `ast-grep` doesn't know types, so a rewrite that's correct for one `foo` may be wrong for another.

### 6. Extract a function or sub-module

**Function.** Copy the block into a new `fn` with explicit params for every captured local. `cargo build`; the compiler reports any captured names you missed. Replace the original block with a call to the new `fn`.

**Sub-module.** Create the new file (e.g. `src/parse/foo.rs`), add `mod foo;` to the parent (`src/parse.rs` or `src/parse/mod.rs`). Move items, mark `pub` whatever crosses the boundary. `cargo build`; the compiler lists every now-unresolved import; `cargo fix --allow-dirty` auto-adds many of them. Commit before `cargo fix` so the auto-edit diff is reviewable.

### 7. Prune unused code

```sh
cargo build 2>&1 | grep -E 'warning: (unused|never used|dead_code)'
cargo clippy -- -W dead_code -W unused
```

Then delete what's truly dead, or mark `#[allow(dead_code)]` deliberately for things kept on purpose. If `cargo machete` is on PATH, run it for unused-dependency detection.

## Pitfalls

- `ast-grep` is syntactic, not type-aware. It cannot disambiguate two `foo`s in different modules — scope by path or do the rewrite in stages.
- Don't stack `cargo clippy --fix` on top of uncommitted `ast-grep` rewrites in the same pass. Commit between phases so a bad rewrite is easy to revert.
- `cargo build` alone doesn't catch test regressions or new clippy issues introduced by a rewrite. Run the `verify` skill before declaring the refactor done.
