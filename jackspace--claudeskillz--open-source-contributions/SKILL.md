## Pre-PR Cleanup Process

### Step 1: Run Pre-PR Check Script

Use the bundled `scripts/pre-pr-check.sh` to scan for artifacts:

```bash
./scripts/pre-pr-check.sh
```

**What it checks:**
- Personal documents (SESSION.md, planning/*, NOTES.md)
- Screenshots not referenced in PR description
- Temporary test files
- Large files (>1MB)
- Potential secrets in file content
- PR size (warns if >400 lines)
- Uncommitted changes

### Step 2: Review Git Status

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
```

**Ask yourself:**
- Is every file change necessary for THIS feature/fix?
- Are there any unrelated changes?
- Are there files I added during development but don't need?

### Step 3: Clean Personal Artifacts

**Manual removal:**
```bash
git rm --cached SESSION.md
git rm --cached -r planning/
git rm --cached screenshots/debug-*.png
git rm --cached test-manual.js
```

**Or use the clean script:**
```bash
./scripts/clean-branch.sh
```

### Step 4: Update .gitignore

Add personal patterns to `.git/info/exclude` (affects only YOUR checkout):
```
# Personal development artifacts
SESSION.md
NOTES.md
TODO.md
planning/
screenshots/debug-*.png
test-manual.*
scratch.*
```

## Writing Effective PR Descriptions

### Use the What/Why/How Structure

**Template** (see `references/pr-template.md`):

```markdown
## What?
[Brief description of what this PR does]

## Why?
[Explain the reasoning, business value, or problem being solved]

## How?
[Describe the implementation approach and key decisions]

## Testing
[Step-by-step instructions for reviewers to test]

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CI passing
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

## Related Issues
Closes #123
Relates to #456
```

### Example Good PR Description

```markdown
## What?
Add OAuth2 authentication support for Google and GitHub providers

## Why?
Users have requested social login to reduce friction during signup.
This implements Key Result 2 of Q4 OKR1.

## How?
- Implemented OAuth2 flow using passport.js
- Added provider configuration in environment variables
- Created callback routes for each provider
- Updated user model to link social accounts

## Testing
1. Set up OAuth apps in Google/GitHub developer consoles
2. Add credentials to `.env` (see `.env.example`)
3. Run `npm start`
4. Click "Login with Google" and verify flow
5. Verify user profile merges correctly

## Breaking Changes
None - this is additive functionality

## Related Issues
Closes #234
Relates to #156 (social login epic)
```

### Titles: Follow Conventional Commits

**Format**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only
- `style:` - Formatting (no code change)
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- `perf:` - Performance improvement
- `test:` - Adding/updating tests
- `build:` - Build system changes
- `ci:` - CI configuration changes
- `chore:` - Other changes (no src/test changes)

**Examples:**
```
✅ feat(auth): add OAuth2 support for Google and GitHub
✅ fix(api): resolve memory leak in worker shutdown
✅ docs(readme): update installation instructions for v2.0
✅ refactor(utils): extract validation logic to separate module

❌ Fixed stuff
❌ Updates
❌ Working on authentication (too vague)
```

---

## Commit Message Best Practices

### Structure

See `references/commit-message-guide.md` for complete guide.

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Subject line rules:**
- 50 characters max
- Imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
- Capitalize first word
- No period at end
- Describe WHAT changed

**Body rules (optional):**
- 72 characters per line
- Explain WHY (code shows WHAT)
- Separate from subject with blank line

**Footer (optional):**
- Reference issues: `Closes #123`
- Note breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: ...`

### Examples

**Good:**
```
fix: prevent race condition in cache invalidation

The cache invalidation logic wasn't thread-safe, causing
occasional race conditions when multiple workers tried to
invalidate the same key simultaneously.

Added mutex locks around the critical section and tests
to verify thread-safety.

Fixes #456
```

**Bad:**
```
Fixed bug                          # Too vague
WIP                               # Not descriptive
asdf                              # Meaningless
Updated auth.js                   # Describes file, not change
Fixed the issue with the thing    # No specifics
```

---

## PR Sizing Best Practices

### Ideal Sizes

**Research-backed guidelines:**
- **Ideal**: 50 lines of code
- **Good**: Under 200 lines
- **Maximum**: 400 lines
- **Beyond 400**: Defect detection drops significantly

**Why small PRs matter:**
- Faster reviews (maintainers can review in one sitting)
- Easier to find bugs
- Simpler to revert if needed
- Reduced merge conflicts
- More focused discussions

### How to Keep PRs Small

**1. One Change = One PR**
```
❌ BAD: Refactor auth module + add OAuth + fix bug + update docs (800 lines)

✅ GOOD:
  PR #1: Refactor auth module (150 lines)
  PR #2: Add OAuth support (200 lines)
  PR #3: Fix authentication bug (50 lines)
  PR #4: Update authentication docs (80 lines)
```

**2. Separate Refactoring from Features**
```
❌ BAD: Add feature X + refactor related code (500 lines)

✅ GOOD:
  PR #1: Refactor to prepare for feature X (200 lines)
  PR #2: Add feature X (150 lines)
```

**3. Use Feature Flags**
Ship incomplete features behind flags, merge early and often:
```typescript
if (featureFlags.newAuth) {
  // New OAuth flow (incomplete but behind flag)
} else {
  // Existing flow
}
```

**4. Break Down by Layer**
```
For "User Authentication" feature:
  PR #1: Database schema + migrations (100 lines)
  PR #2: API endpoints (150 lines)
  PR #3: Frontend components (200 lines)
  PR #4: Tests + documentation (150 lines)
```

### When Large PRs Are Acceptable

- Initial project scaffolding
- Generated code (clearly marked as such)
- Large refactors that can't be split (explain why in description)
- Documentation rewrites
- Dependency updates (automated)

**If unavoidable**: Add clear section headers in PR description to guide review.

---

## Following Project Conventions

### Step 1: Read CONTRIBUTING.md

**Always read this FIRST** - it's the project's law. Common locations:
- `/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Key sections to check:**
- Development setup
- Testing requirements
- Code style guidelines
- Commit message format
- PR process
- Review expectations

**Tip**: Add `/contribute` to repository URL to find beginner-friendly issues.

### Step 2: Check for Style Guides

**Files to look for:**
- `.eslintrc`, `.eslintrc.js` (JavaScript/TypeScript linting)
- `.prettierrc` (Code formatting)
- `.editorconfig` (Editor settings)
- `STYLE.md` (Style guide documentation)
- `rustfmt.toml` (Rust formatting)
- `pyproject.toml` (Python formatting)

**Run formatters before committing:**
```bash
npm run lint                # Check for style issues
npm run lint:fix            # Auto-fix style issues
npm run format              # Format code (Prettier, Black, etc.)
```

### Step 3: Match Existing Patterns

**Look at recent merged PRs:**
- How are files organized?
- What naming conventions are used?
- How verbose are comments?
- What testing patterns exist?
- How are imports ordered?

**The Golden Rule**: "Do things the way the project maintainers would want it done."

### Step 4: Test Requirements

**Before submitting:**
```bash
# Run full test suite
npm test                    # Node projects
cargo test                  # Rust projects
pytest                      # Python projects
go test ./...               # Go projects

# Check coverage (if required)
npm run test:coverage

# Run linters
npm run lint

# Build the project
npm run build
```

**Never submit a PR with:**
- Failing tests
- Failing lints
- Build errors
- Untested new code (if tests are required)

---

## Communication Best Practices

### Before Starting Work

**Comment on the issue:**
```
Hi! I'd like to work on this issue. My approach would be to:
1. [Brief outline of approach]
2. [Key implementation detail]

Does this sound good? Any guidance before I start?
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents duplicate work
- Gets early feedback on approach
- Shows respect for maintainers' time
- Establishes communication

**Wait for acknowledgment** on significant changes before investing time.

### Writing PR Comments

**When submitting:**
```
@maintainer I've implemented the feature as discussed in #123.
I went with approach A instead of B because [reason].

Ready for review when you have time. Happy to make changes!
```

**When responding to feedback:**
```
Good catch! I've updated this in commit abc1234.
```

```
I considered that approach, but went with X because Y.
Happy to discuss alternatives if you prefer a different direction.
```

```
Could you elaborate on what you mean by Z?
I want to make sure I understand correctly.
```

### Responding to Review Comments

**Key principles:**
1. **Address every comment** - Even if just "Done" or "Acknowledged"
2. **Never respond in anger** - Walk away if needed, respond when calm
3. **Use GitHub's review tools**:
   - Mark conversations as resolved when addressed
   - Request re-review after changes
   - Use "suggestion" feature for quick fixes
4. **Keep discussion on-topic** - Take tangents elsewhere
5. **Be thankful** - Reviews are valuable, time-consuming work

**Response templates:**
- Implemented: "Good idea! Implemented in [commit hash]"
- Question: "Thanks for asking - I did X because Y. Thoughts?"
- Disagreement: "I see your point. I went with X because Y. Open to alternatives if you feel strongly."
- Clarification needed: "Could you help me understand what you mean by Z?"

### Handling PR Rejections

**Mental framework:**
- It's a learning experience, not a personal failure
- Rejection is normal and happens to everyone
- The project's vision might differ from your approach

**Steps to take:**
1. **Seek clarification** - Ask why the PR was rejected politely
2. **Review feedback carefully** - Identify specific concerns
3. **Learn from it** - What would you do differently next time?
4. **Options**:
   - Rework based on feedback
   - Fork and maintain your changes
   - Move on to other contributions

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't keep commenting on declined PRs
- Don't take it personally
- Don't argue aggressively
- Don't abandon the project entirely (unless it's truly not a fit)

### Be Patient (But Know When to Ping)

**Maintainers are often volunteers:**
- They have day jobs, families, lives
- They may be reviewing dozens of PRs
- They may be dealing with complex project issues

**Timeline expectations:**
- Small PRs: 1-7 days
- Large PRs: 1-2 weeks
- Complex/controversial: Weeks to months

**When to ping:**
- After 1 week for small PRs
- After 2 weeks for larger PRs
- When CI is failing due to external changes (rebase needed)

**How to ping:**
```
Hi! Just wanted to gently ping this PR.
No rush at all, just making sure it's on your radar.
Happy to answer any questions or make changes!
```

## Common Mistakes That Annoy Maintainers

### The Top 16 Mistakes

**See Critical Workflow Rules section for detailed guidance on Rules 1-3**

**1. Not Reading CONTRIBUTING.md**
- Impact: Wasted effort, rejected PRs, frustrated maintainers
- Fix: ALWAYS read this file first, follow instructions exactly

**2. Including Personal Development Artifacts**
- Impact: Messy PRs, reveals internal workflow, unprofessional
- Fix: Use pre-PR check script, clean artifacts before submission
- Examples: SESSION.md, planning/*, screenshots, temp test files

**3. Submitting Massive Pull Requests**
- Impact: Overwhelming to review, harder to find bugs, delays merge
- Fix: Break into smaller PRs (<200 lines ideal)

**4. Not Testing Code Before Submitting (Violates RULE 2)**
- Impact: CI failures, bugs in production, maintainer has to fix, loss of trust
- Fix: See **RULE 2** - Run full test suite, test manually, capture evidence (screenshots/videos), verify CI will pass

**5. Working on Already Assigned Issues**
- Impact: Duplicate work, wasted time for both contributors
- Fix: Check issue assignments, comment to claim work

**6. Not Discussing Changes First (for large changes)**
- Impact: Unwanted features, rejected PRs, wasted development time
- Fix: Open issue or comment to discuss before coding

**7. Being Impatient or Unresponsive**
- Impact: PRs stall, maintainers move on, contributions abandoned
- Fix: Be responsive but patient, ping respectfully after 1-2 weeks

**8. Not Updating Documentation**
- Impact: Users and developers confused by undocumented changes
- Fix: Update README, API docs, inline comments as needed

**9. Ignoring Code Style Standards**
- Impact: Messy codebase, maintainer has to fix formatting
- Fix: Use project's linters/formatters, match existing style

**10. Ignoring CI Failures**
- Impact: Can't merge, blocks progress, maintainer has to investigate
- Fix: Monitor CI, fix failures immediately, ask for help if stuck

**11. Including Unrelated Changes (Violates RULE 3)**
- Impact: Difficult review, harder to revert, scope creep, confusing git history
- Fix: See **RULE 3** - One PR = One Feature. Keep focused, split unrelated changes into separate branches/PRs

**12. Not Linking Issues Properly**
- Impact: Lost context, manual issue closing, harder to track
- Fix: Use "Closes #123" or "Fixes #456" in PR description

**13. Committing Secrets or Sensitive Data**
- Impact: Security risk, requires emergency response, potential breach
- Fix: Use .gitignore, scan for secrets, never commit .env files

**14. Force-Pushing Without Warning**
- Impact: Breaks reviewer's local copies, loses comments
- Fix: Avoid force-push after review starts, warn if necessary

**15. Not Running Build/Tests Locally**
- Impact: CI failures for obvious issues, wastes CI resources
- Fix: Always run `npm run build` and `npm test` before pushing

**16. Working Directly on main/master Branch (Violates RULE 1)**
- Impact: Messy git history, conflicts with upstream, can't work on multiple features, difficult to sync fork
- Fix: See **RULE 1** - ALWAYS create feature branches (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`), NEVER commit to main

---

## GitHub-Specific Best Practices

### Fork Workflow (Standard for Open Source)

**Initial setup:**
```bash
# 1. Fork repository on GitHub (click Fork button)

# 2. Clone YOUR fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/project-name.git
cd project-name

# 3. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/project-name.git

# 4. Verify remotes
git remote -v
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/project-name.git (fetch)
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/project-name.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/project-name.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/project-name.git (push)
```

**Creating feature branch:**
```bash
# NEVER work on main/master directly!
git checkout -b feature/add-oauth-support

# Make changes...
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 support"

# Push to YOUR fork
git push origin feature/add-oauth-support
```

**Keeping fork in sync:**
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

---

### Critical Workflow Rules (NEVER SKIP)

**RULE 1: ALWAYS Work on a Feature Branch**

```bash
# ❌ NEVER DO THIS
git checkout main
# make changes directly on main
git commit -m "add feature"  # BAD!

# ✅ ALWAYS DO THIS
git checkout main
git pull upstream main  # Sync first
git checkout -b feature/add-oauth-support  # Descriptive branch name
# make changes on feature branch
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth support"
```

**Why this matters:**
- Keeps main clean and in sync with upstream
- Allows working on multiple features simultaneously
- Makes it easy to abandon or restart work
- Required by most open source projects
- Prevents conflicts and messy git history

**Branch naming conventions:**
```
feature/descriptive-name    # New features
fix/issue-123               # Bug fixes
docs/update-readme          # Documentation
refactor/extract-utils      # Refactoring
test/add-unit-tests         # Test additions
```

---

**RULE 2: Test Thoroughly BEFORE Submitting PR**

Never submit a PR without:

1. **Running the full test suite locally:**
   ```bash
   npm test              # Node.js
   cargo test            # Rust
   pytest                # Python
   go test ./...         # Go
   ```

2. **Testing manually** (hands-on verification):
   - Run the application
   - Test the specific feature you added
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Verify it works as intended

3. **Capturing evidence** (for visual/UI changes):
   - Take screenshots showing the feature working
   - Record a short demo video if complex
   - Include in PR description to demonstrate functionality

4. **Checking CI will pass:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint          # Linting
   npm run build         # Build succeeds
   npm run type-check    # TypeScript checks
   ```

**Example testing checklist for a new OAuth feature:**
```markdown
## Testing Performed

### Automated Tests
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ Added 12 new tests for OAuth flow
- ✅ Coverage increased from 85% to 87%

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Tested Google OAuth flow end-to-end
- ✅ Tested GitHub OAuth flow end-to-end
- ✅ Verified error handling (invalid tokens, network failures)
- ✅ Confirmed user profile merging works correctly
- ✅ Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### Evidence
See screenshots below showing successful login flow.
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents CI failures that waste maintainer time
- Shows you care about code quality
- Demonstrates the feature actually works
- Builds trust with maintainers
- Catches bugs before review

**Screenshots for PR descriptions:**
```
✅ Include: Working feature demonstration
✅ Include: Before/after comparisons for changes
✅ Include: Error state handling

❌ Don't include: Debug screenshots in code commits
❌ Don't include: Personal testing screenshots in repo
❌ Don't include: Unrelated screenshots

Location: Add to PR description on GitHub, NOT as files in commits
```

---

**RULE 3: Keep PRs Focused and Cohesive**

**One PR = One Feature/Fix**

```
✅ GOOD: Single PR adding OAuth support
  - OAuth provider configuration
  - Login/callback routes
  - User model updates
  - Tests for OAuth flow
  - Documentation for setup

❌ BAD: PR with multiple unrelated changes
  - OAuth support
  - + Unrelated bug fix in validation
  - + Random formatting changes
  - + Update to README for different feature
```

**Why cohesive PRs matter:**
- Easier to review and understand
- Can be merged/rejected independently
- Simpler to revert if issues found
- Faster review cycles
- Clear git history

**How to keep PRs focused:**

1. **Plan before coding:**
   - What is the ONE thing this PR does?
   - What files MUST be changed for this feature?
   - What's the minimal set of changes needed?

2. **During development:**
   - If you notice an unrelated bug, create a separate branch
   - If you're tempted to fix formatting, do it in a separate PR
   - Stay focused on the single goal

3. **Before committing:**
   - Review your changes: `git diff`
   - Ask: "Is this file change necessary for THIS feature?"
   - Move unrelated changes to stash: `git stash`

4. **Size guidelines:**
   - Ideal: <200 lines changed
   - Acceptable: 200-400 lines
   - Large: 400-800 lines (needs justification)
   - Too large: >800 lines (should be split)

**Breaking up large features:**

If a feature is naturally large, break it into phases:

```
PR #1: Database schema and models
PR #2: API endpoints
PR #3: Frontend components
PR #4: Integration and tests
```

Each PR:
- Builds on the previous
- Is independently reviewable
- Adds working functionality (or is clearly marked as WIP/foundational)

**Handling accidental scope creep:**

```bash
# You added OAuth + accidentally fixed a bug
# Split them into separate commits and PRs:

# 1. Create bug fix branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b fix/validation-bug

# 2. Cherry-pick just the bug fix commits
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-of-bug-fix>

# 3. Submit bug fix PR separately
git push origin fix/validation-bug

# 4. Continue with OAuth PR
git checkout feature/add-oauth-support
# Remove bug fix commits if needed
git rebase -i main
```

---

### Using Draft PRs

**When to use:**
- Code is work-in-progress, not ready for review
- You want early feedback on approach
- Starting conversation about implementation
- Sharing incomplete code for collaboration

**Benefits:**
- Prevents accidental merging
- Suppresses reviewer notifications
- Clearly signals "not ready yet"

**Create draft PR:**
```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "WIP: Add OAuth support"
```

**Mark ready when:**
- Code is complete and tested
- CI is passing
- Documentation is updated
- Ready for formal review

```bash
gh pr ready
```

### Linking Issues Properly

**Automatic closing keywords** (in PR description or commits):
```markdown
Closes #123
