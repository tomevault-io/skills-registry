# Content Bank

Bank and retrieve reusable content for writing and coding—ideas, snippets, outlines, and code patterns—organized by topic.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Details |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Store** | Save reusable content into the bank | See [storing.md](storing.md) |
| **Retrieve** | Search and get previously banked content | See [retrieving.md](retrieving.md) |
| **List** | Browse topics and content | See [listing.md](listing.md) |

## When to Use

**Proactively offer to store** when detecting:
- Well-crafted paragraphs with standalone value
- Structural patterns that could template future writing
- Useful code patterns worth preserving
- Legacy code being replaced that has reuse value

**Proactively offer to retrieve** when:
- Starting a new piece where relevant banked content may exist
- Facing a problem that might have a banked solution

## Auto-Initialization

**Before any store/retrieve/list operation**, check if `content-bank/topics.md` exists. If not, create it with the initial template to set up the content bank structure.

## Content Bank Structure

```
content-bank/
├── topics.md           # Topic index
└── {topic}/            # One folder per topic (kebab-case)
    ├── ideas.md        # Concepts and themes
    ├── snippets.md     # Reusable fragments
    └── outlines.md     # Structural frameworks
```

## Entry Format

```markdown
### {Title}
- **Type**: writing | code
- **Source**: {file path, URL, or "original"}
- **Why useful**: {one sentence on reuse value}
- **Tags**: {comma-separated keywords}
- **Content**:
  > {text content or code block}
```

## Quick Reference

- **Store**: `Bank this about {topic}`
- **Retrieve**: `Find {topic}` or `What do I have on {keywords}?`
- **List**: `Show topics` or `Browse {topic}`
