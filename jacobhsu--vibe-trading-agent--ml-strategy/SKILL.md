# Machine-Learning Predictive Strategy

## Purpose

Use sklearn machine-learning models (`RandomForest` / `GradientBoosting` / `Ridge`) to predict the direction of future returns and generate trading signals. Walk-forward training is used to avoid future data leakage, and feature engineering extracts useful factors from OHLCV data.

## Signal Logic

1. **Feature engineering**: build multi-dimensional factors from raw OHLCV data (momentum, volatility, RSI, moving-average ratios, volume ratio, and more)
2. **Label construction**: future N-day return > 0 is the positive class (`1`), < 0 is the negative class (`0`)
3. **Walk-forward training**: use an expanding window (not a fixed window), train on historical data only, and roll forward day by day for prediction
4. **Signal generation**: map `predict_proba[:, 1]` to `[-1.0, 1.0]`, or use discrete signals from `predict` in `{-1, 0, 1}`

## Feature Engineering Template

The following are commonly used features, all computed with pandas:

| Feature Name | Formula | Meaning |
|--------|---------|------|
| ret_5d | `close.pct_change(5)` | Past 5-day return (short-term momentum) |
| ret_20d | `close.pct_change(20)` | Past 20-day return (medium-term momentum) |
| vol_20d | `returns.rolling(20).std()` | 20-day volatility |
| rsi_14 | See the RSI formula below | Relative Strength Index |
| ma_ratio | `close / close.rolling(20).mean()` | Degree of deviation from the 20-day moving average |
| volume_ratio | `volume / volume.rolling(20).mean()` | Volume ratio (current volume vs 20-day average) |
| bb_position | `(close - bb_lower) / (bb_upper - bb_lower)` | Bollinger Band position (`0`=lower band, `1`=upper band) |
| high_low_ratio | `(high - low) / close` | Intraday range ratio |
| close_open_ratio | `(close - open) / open` | Intraday return |
| skew_20d | `returns.rolling(20).skew()` | Return skewness |

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def build_features(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Build a machine-learning feature matrix from OHLCV data.

    Args:
        df: DataFrame containing open, high, low, close, and volume columns.

    Returns:
        DataFrame with added feature columns prefixed by 'f_'.
    """
    c = df["close"]
    v = df["volume"]
    ret = c.pct_change()

    features = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
    features["f_ret_5d"] = c.pct_change(5)
    features["f_ret_20d"] = c.pct_change(20)
    features["f_vol_20d"] = ret.rolling(20).std()
    features["f_ma_ratio"] = c / c.rolling(20).mean()
    features["f_volume_ratio"] = v / v.rolling(20).mean()

    # RSI(14)
    delta = c.diff()
    gain = delta.clip(lower=0).rolling(14).mean()
    loss = (-delta.clip(upper=0)).rolling(14).mean()
    rs = gain / loss
    features["f_rsi_14"] = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))

    # Bollinger Band position
    ma20 = c.rolling(20).mean()
    std20 = c.rolling(20).std()
    bb_upper = ma20 + 2 * std20
    bb_lower = ma20 - 2 * std20
    features["f_bb_position"] = (c - bb_lower) / (bb_upper - bb_lower)

    # Intraday features
    features["f_high_low_ratio"] = (df["high"] - df["low"]) / c
    features["f_close_open_ratio"] = (c - df["open"]) / df["open"]
    features["f_skew_20d"] = ret.rolling(20).skew()

    return features
```

## Model Selection Guide

| Model | Advantages | Disadvantages | Applicable Scenario |
|------|------|------|---------|
| RandomForestClassifier | Hard to overfit, robust to hyperparameters, can output feature importance | Weaker at capturing trend-style features | Default first-choice model, medium data size |
| GradientBoostingClassifier | High accuracy, captures complex nonlinear relationships | Easy to overfit, slow to train, requires careful tuning | Sufficient data and tuning experience |
| Ridge / LogisticRegression | Fast training, interpretable, difficult to overfit | Captures only linear relationships | Fast baseline, few features, small dataset |

## Walk-Forward Training Template (Critical)

**Core principle: it is strictly forbidden to train on the full dataset and then predict the full dataset. That is future data leakage.**

- You must use an expanding window or rolling window
- `StandardScaler` must be `fit` on the training set only, then `transform` the test set
- Predict only the current day (or a small forward slice) each time, then roll the window forward

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def walk_forward_predict(
    features: pd.DataFrame,
    labels: pd.Series,
    min_train_size: int = 252,
    retrain_freq: int = 20,
    model_type: str = "random_forest",
) -> pd.Series:
    """Walk-forward training and prediction to avoid future data leakage.

    Args:
        features: Feature matrix aligned with labels by row index.
        labels: Binary labels (0/1), representing the direction of future N-day returns.
        min_train_size: Minimum training-set size in trading days.
        retrain_freq: Retrain the model every N days.
        model_type: Model type, one of "random_forest" / "gradient_boosting" / "ridge".

    Returns:
        Predicted signal series with range [-1.0, 1.0].
    """
    predictions = pd.Series(0.0, index=features.index)
    model = None
    scaler = None

    for i in range(min_train_size, len(features)):
        # Retrain every retrain_freq days
        if model is None or (i - min_train_size) % retrain_freq == 0:
            # Expanding window: train on [0, i)
            X_train = features.iloc[:i].values
            y_train = labels.iloc[:i].values

            # Drop rows with NaN
            valid = ~(np.isnan(X_train).any(axis=1) | np.isnan(y_train))

                continue

            # Standardization: fit only on training set
            scaler = StandardScaler()
            X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

            # Build the model

                model = RandomForestClassifier(
                    n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, random_state=42
                )
            elif model_type == "gradient_boosting":

            else:

            model.fit(X_train, y_train)

        # Predict today
        X_today = features.iloc[i : i + 1].values
        if np.isnan(X_today).any():
            predictions.iloc[i] = 0.0
            continue

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|------|--------|------|
| model_type | `"random_forest"` | Model type: `random_forest` / `gradient_boosting` / `ridge` |
| min_train_size | 252 | Minimum training-set size (starting length of the expanding window) |
| retrain_freq | 20 | Retraining frequency (every N trading days) |
| prediction_horizon | 5 | Prediction horizon (future N-day return) |
| n_estimators | 100 | Number of trees for tree-based models |
| max_depth | 5 | Maximum tree depth (prevents overfitting) |
| threshold | 0.0 | Signal filtering threshold (`abs(signal) < threshold` is set to 0) |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Data leakage (most fatal)**: running `fit_transform` on the full dataset before backtesting means future information was used. Walk-forward is mandatory, and the training set must contain history only
2. **Standardization leakage**: using `StandardScaler` on the full dataset to compute means and standard deviations, then transforming everything. The correct approach is `fit_transform` on the training set, then `transform` only on the test set
3. **Overfitting**: trees that are too deep (`max_depth > 10`), too many features, or too small a training set. Keep `max_depth=3~5` and feature count `< 15`
4. **Class imbalance**: in bull markets the up/down ratio may be 7:3, so the model may prefer predicting the majority class. Use `class_weight="balanced"` or SMOTE if needed
5. **Feature noise**: irrelevant features add noise and reduce performance. Check `feature_importances_` after training and remove features with importance below 1%
6. **Look-ahead bias (non-leakage form)**: computing features from today's close and predicting today's signal. Make sure features use only data from T-1 and earlier
7. **Retraining frequency**: too frequent (daily) makes training slow and overfits recent data; too sparse (yearly) makes the model stale. Recommended `retrain_freq=20` (about one month)

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install scikit-learn joblib pandas numpy
```

## Signal Convention

- `predict_proba[:, 1]` mapped through `prob * 2 - 1` to `[-1.0, 1.0]` (continuous-strength signal)
- Or discrete signals from `predict()` in `{-1, 0, 1}` (short, neutral, long)
- Positive values = bullish direction, negative values = bearish direction, absolute value = confidence strength
