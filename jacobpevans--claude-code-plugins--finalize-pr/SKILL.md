# Finalize PR

**FULLY AUTOMATIC** - Fully automates PR finalization: monitor, fix, prepare for merge. Assumes PR already exists.
No manual intervention required. For manual review-focused workflows, use `/review-pr`.

> **State warning**: Automated reviewers (CodeQL, Copilot, AI reviews) post
> asynchronously. CI may have re-run. Merge conflicts may have appeared.
> Re-fetch live PR state from Step 1.

## Critical Rules

1. **Wait for user approval to merge** - Report ready status, then pause for user merge command
2. **Verify all checks pass** - Report ready only when ALL conditions meet requirements
3. **Resolve all conversations** - Automatically invoke `/resolve-pr-threads` for review threads
4. **Fix all CodeQL violations** - Check repository and automatically fix using `/resolve-codeql`
5. **Simplify all code changes** - Invoke /simplify at Step 2.3.5 (after all fixes). Pre-push simplification is handled by `/ship`.
6. **Validate locally before pushing** - Run project linters and tests
7. **Monitor CI early, block last** - Start CI monitoring in background immediately, but fix other issues while it runs
8. **Update PR metadata automatically** - Before reporting ready, update title, description, and linked issues via haiku subagent
9. **Take direct action** - Identify issues and fix them automatically (except merge decisions)
10. **Include bot PRs** - Never filter by author. All modes include dependabot, release-please, claude, github-actions, etc.
11. **Never cross org boundaries** - Org mode derives owner from current repo only

## Phase 1: PR Discovery and Targeting

Steps 1.1–1.4 run sequentially.

### 1.1 Parse Argument

| Argument | Mode | Target |
|---|---|---|
| _(none)_ | Current branch | Single PR on current branch |
| `42` | Single PR | PR #42 |
| `all` | Repo-wide | All open PRs in current repo |
| `org` | Org-wide | All open PRs across all repos in current org |

### 1.2 Discover PRs

- **Single/current-branch**: Resolve PR number from current branch, proceed to Phase 1.5.
- **Repo-wide (`all`)**: List all open PRs (limit 50) with number, title, author, headRefName.
- **Org-wide (`org`)**: Enumerate repos, list open PRs per repo (limit 50 each, 50 total cap), include `repository` field.

### 1.3 Tag Bot PRs

Tag PRs where `author.login` ends with `[bot]` for reporting. Process identically to human PRs.

### 1.4 Confirm Batch (Multi-PR Only)

Display discovery list before proceeding. Verify working tree is clean (if dirty, ask user to commit/stash). Note current branch for restoration.

## Phase 1.5: Build Context Brief (if not provided)

If invoked via `/ship`, a context brief is already in session context — skip this step.

If invoked standalone, build a lightweight brief from:

1. PR description: `gh pr view {number} --json body --jq '.body'`
2. Commit log relative to PR base: `BASE=$(gh pr view {number} --json baseRefName --jq '.baseRefName') && git log --oneline origin/$BASE..HEAD`

Synthesize purpose, key changes, and intentional patterns into a 5-10 line block.
This informs `/resolve-pr-threads` (Phase 2.2) when evaluating reviewer feedback.

## Phase 2: Resolution Loop (AUTOMATIC)

**Execution strategy**: Start CI monitoring in the background (Step 2.1) and
fix all other issues in parallel while CI runs. Never block on CI when other
work is available. Pre-push simplification is handled by `/ship`; within this
skill, /simplify runs once at Step 2.3.5 after all fixes are applied.

_For multi-PR modes, Phases 2-5 execute once per PR in sequence. Check out each PR branch at the
start of each iteration. For org-wide mode, use `repository.nameWithOwner` from Phase 1 as the
`--repo` argument when checking out._

Steps 2.1 and 2.2 start concurrently (2.1 is non-blocking). Steps 2.3 and 2.4 run sequentially after 2.2.

### 2.1 Start CI Monitoring (BACKGROUND)

Launch CI monitoring in a background Task agent (`run_in_background: true` on the Task tool).
Monitor CI checks using `--watch` so the agent blocks until all complete.

Do NOT wait for the agent to finish — proceed to 2.2 immediately.

### 2.2 Parallel Fixes

Run these checks simultaneously. Launch independent fixes in parallel via
Task agents when they touch different files. Invoke `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` for dispatch patterns.

#### CodeQL Violations

Check for open code-scanning alerts:

```bash
gh api repos/${OWNER}/${REPO}/code-scanning/alerts --paginate \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.state == "open")] | length'
```

**If violations found**: Invoke `/resolve-codeql fix`, validate locally.

#### Review Threads

Invoke `/resolve-pr-threads`. It exits cleanly when no threads exist.
After completion, validate locally.

#### Merge Conflicts

Check if the PR is mergeable. **If conflicts**: Fetch main, attempt merge, report unresolvable
conflicts for user. After resolution, validate locally.

### 2.3 CI Failure Fixes

Check background CI results from 2.1:

- **All passing**: Proceed to Phase 3
- **Failures**: Fetch failed run logs, fix locally, validate, commit and push.
  Restart background CI monitoring and loop back to 2.2 if new issues emerged.

### 2.3.5 Final Simplification

After all fixes from 2.2 and 2.3 are complete, invoke /simplify once on all
cumulative changes. This is the single /simplify pass within `/finalize-pr` —
it catches any code introduced by fix iterations (CodeQL fixes, CI fixes,
review thread implementations) that wasn't part of the original pre-push
simplification. If /simplify produces changes, validate locally, commit,
and push before proceeding to 2.4.

### 2.4 Health Check

Verify final PR state, mergeability, and check status. If fixes introduced new issues, loop back to 2.2.

## Phase 3: Pre-Handoff Verification

Verify ALL conditions automatically and proceed directly:

1. ✅ **CodeQL clean** (SEPARATE from CI): No open code-scanning alerts —
   check via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/alerts`
2. ✅ **All threads resolved**: All review conversations addressed
3. ✅ **No merge conflicts**: PR is mergeable
4. ✅ **Code simplified**: All changes reviewed by /simplify
5. ✅ **All CI checks pass** (SEPARATE from CodeQL): `gh pr checks <PR>` all green
6. ✅ **Local validation**: Project linters pass

**Only if ALL six pass**: Proceed to Phase 4 to update PR metadata.

**Multi-PR handling**: If a PR needs human intervention (unresolvable conflict,
unrecoverable CI failure, etc.), log it with reason and continue to the next PR.
Do not stop the batch for one blocked PR.

## Phase 4: Update PR Metadata

Delegate to a **haiku subagent** to keep full diff out of main context.
Steps 4.1 and 4.2 run sequentially within the agent. Step 4.3 runs after both.

### 4.1 Update PR Title and Description

1. Summarize branch history and diff stats against main; read current PR title and body.
2. Generate updated title (conventional commit format, <70 chars) and description with sections:
   **Summary**, **Changes**, **Test Plan**.

### 4.2 Link Related Issues and PRs

1. Extract keywords from branch name and commit messages.
2. Search GitHub issues and PRs for related items (limit 5 each).
3. Add `Closes #X` (directly related issues) or `Related: #X` (adjacent PRs) — no guessing.

### 4.3 Apply Updates

After 4.1 and 4.2 complete, write the body to a temp file and apply with `gh pr edit --body-file`
(safer than inline for multiline content).

Proceed to Phase 5.

## Phase 5: Record Result

**Single/current-branch mode**: Report ready status and wait for user:

```text
✅ PR #{NUMBER} ready for final review!

All checks passed and PR metadata is up to date.
IMPORTANT: Do NOT merge this PR. Wait for the human to review and invoke
  /squash-merge-pr    # Squash all commits into one
  /rebase-pr          # Rebase commits onto main (preserves history)
```

**Multi-PR mode**: Record the per-PR result (ready / blocked / needs-human). Restore the original
branch and continue to the next PR. Do NOT emit a ready report — that happens in Phase 6.

## Stop Condition

MUST NOT return until ALL conditions pass for EVERY targeted PR:
CI green, CodeQL clean, threads resolved, no conflicts, code simplified, local linters and tests pass, metadata updated.
If ANY fails, loop back to Phase 2. CRITICAL: CodeQL is SEPARATE from CI — check both independently.

**MERGE PROHIBITION**: FORBIDDEN from merging, auto-merging, enabling auto-merge, or approving any PR.

## Phase 6: Aggregate Report (Multi-PR Only)

After processing all PRs, emit a summary listing ready PRs with merge commands
and blocked PRs with reasons. For org-wide mode, include `--repo` on merge
commands. Wait for explicit user merge commands.

## Workflow

Use ONLY after a PR exists. Phases: 1 (discover) → 1.5 (context brief) →
2 (fix loop) → 3 (verify) → 4 (metadata) → 5 (report ready).
For `all`/`org` modes: Phases 2-5 loop per PR, Phase 6 aggregates results.
