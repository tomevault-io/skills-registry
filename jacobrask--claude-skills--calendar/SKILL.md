# Calendar

Apple Calendar management via AppleScript.

## Key Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `list_calendars.sh` | List all available calendars (TSV/JSON) |
| `get_events.sh` | Get events with date range filtering (TSV/markdown/JSON) |
| `create_event.sh` | Create new calendar event |
| `search_events.sh` | Search events by keyword |

## List Calendars

```bash
list_calendars.sh           # Simple list
list_calendars.sh json      # JSON format
```

## Getting Events

```bash
get_events.sh                    # Today's events as TSV
get_events.sh markdown           # Today's events as markdown
get_events.sh --today            # Today's events (TSV)
get_events.sh --week markdown    # Next 7 days
get_events.sh --days 14 json     # Next 14 days
get_events.sh -c "Work"          # Filter by calendar
```

## Creating Events

```bash
create_event.sh "Meeting Title" "2025-12-26 14:00" "2025-12-26 15:00"
create_event.sh "Lunch" "2025-12-27 12:00" "2025-12-27 13:00" "Work"
create_event.sh "Conference" "2025-12-28 09:00" "2025-12-28 17:00" "Work" "San Francisco" "Annual conference"
```

Parameters: `title startDate endDate [calendar] [location] [description]`

## Search Events

```bash
search_events.sh "meeting"
search_events.sh "dentist" markdown
search_events.sh -c "Work" "standup"
```

## Output Formats

- **TSV**: Tab-separated (calendar, title, start, end, location, description)
- **Markdown**: Formatted list with dates and times
- **JSON**: Structured data for processing

**Privacy**: Event data stays local. Calendar.app data accessed via AppleScript only.

## Important Notes

**NEVER delete calendar events without explicit user confirmation.** This skill currently does not include a delete script - if the user requests deletion, always ask for confirmation first and warn about the permanent nature of the action.
