# Flutter Kiwi NLP

## Overview

Use a parity-first workflow.
Keep `KiwiAnalyzer` behavior aligned across native and web.
Preserve public API compatibility unless a breaking change is requested.

## Workflow

1. Collect context.
- Read `README.en.md`, `lib/flutter_kiwi_nlp.dart`, and the affected files
  under `lib/src/`.
- If API contracts change, inspect `lib/src/kiwi_options.dart` and
  `lib/src/kiwi_types.dart`.

2. Implement change.
- Apply equivalent behavior in native and web backends when feasible.
- Keep unsupported targets explicit in `lib/src/kiwi_analyzer_stub.dart`
  (`KiwiException`).
- Preserve clear runtime errors for integration debugging.

3. Validate.
- Run `skills/flutter-kiwi-nlp/scripts/verify_plugin.sh`.
- If platform scripts changed, validate the related script under `tool/` and
  the platform hook (`android/build.gradle`, `ios/*.podspec`,
  `macos/*.podspec`, `linux/CMakeLists.txt`, `windows/CMakeLists.txt`).

4. Document.
- Update `README.en.md` and `README.ko.md` for behavior/config changes.
- Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry for user-visible changes.
- Keep `llms.txt` links aligned with newly added or moved docs.

## Decision rules

- Treat API parity as required for:
  `create`, `nativeVersion`, `analyze`, `addUserWord`, and `close`.
- For model loading bugs, verify precedence and fallback logic before changing
  defaults.
- For platform build issues, prefer fixing auto-prepare scripts before adding
  manual steps.

## Resources

- API and parity contract: `references/api-surface.md`
- Runtime/build references: `references/runtime-and-build.md`
- Reusable checks runner: `scripts/verify_plugin.sh`
