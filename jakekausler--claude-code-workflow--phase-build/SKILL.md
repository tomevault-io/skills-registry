# Build Phase

## Purpose

The Build phase implements the selected approach from Design. It creates working code that can be tested in Refinement.

## Entry Conditions

- Design phase is complete (approach selected, tracking docs updated)
- `epic-stage-workflow` skill has been invoked (shared rules loaded)

## Spec Handoff Protocol (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Planner output doesn't automatically transfer to implementer subagents. Main agent context is NOT inherited by subagents.

**Required workflow:**

1. **Planner/planner-lite agents MUST:**
   - Get timestamp using bash: `TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S)` - NEVER estimate
   - Save spec to `/tmp/spec-$TIMESTAMP.md`
   - Include "Spec saved to: [filepath]" at END of response
   - Example: "Spec saved to: /tmp/spec-2026-01-12-15-30-45.md"

2. **Main agent MUST:**
   - Extract spec file path from planner response
   - Pass file path explicitly to implementer agents
   - NEVER say "use the spec above" or "from planner-lite above"
   - Template: "Read and implement the spec from: /tmp/spec-2026-01-12-15-30-45.md"

3. **Implementer agents (scribe/fixer) MUST:**
   - Read spec file FIRST before any implementation
   - Confirm spec contents in response
   - Example: "Read spec from [filepath]. Spec defines [summary]. Implementing now..."

### "Obvious Steps" Still Require Written Spec

**CRITICAL: "I can describe the steps clearly" ≠ "Skip planner"**

IF you can articulate the implementation steps:
→ Those steps ARE the spec
→ Write them to `/tmp/spec-*.md` via planner-lite
→ Takes 60 seconds, ensures scribe has written reference

ONLY skip spec file for:

- Single-line config changes
- Typo fixes
- Changes requiring zero verification testing

**Test**: If scribe will use Read/Edit tools → Write a spec file first

### Spec-First Sequencing (NO Retroactive Specs)

**CRITICAL: Spec BEFORE implementation. NO exceptions.**

```
CORRECT: planner-lite → spec file → scribe implements spec
WRONG:   scribe implements → write spec after "for documentation"
```

**Why this matters:**

- Specs force you to THINK before acting
- Retroactive specs describe what you did, not what you should do
- Writing spec after defeats the planning purpose entirely

**If you already implemented before reading this:**

- See "Out-of-Sequence Recovery" section above
- DO NOT write a retroactive spec to "comply" - that's not compliance
- The time is already spent; use the recovery workflow

**Rationalizations that don't work:**

- "I'll write the spec after, it's faster" → Spec-after is not a spec
- "The implementation is the spec" → Code is not documentation
- "I know what I'm doing" → Everyone thinks this; spec anyway

### Mid-Implementation Complexity Discovery

**Scenario:** You started with what seemed trivial (no spec needed), but halfway through you realize it's complex.

**This is NOT retroactive spec-writing.** You're writing a PROSPECTIVE spec for remaining work.

**Resolution workflow:**

1. STOP implementation immediately
2. Document what you've learned so far (this is reconnaissance, not retroactive spec)
3. Call planner-lite to write spec for REMAINING work
4. Mark already-completed work as "exploratory spike" in stage file
5. Continue with spec-driven development for remaining work

**Key distinction:**

- ❌ Retroactive = Writing spec for COMPLETED work ("I did X, here's the spec for X")
- ✅ Prospective = Writing spec for REMAINING work after learning ("I learned X, here's spec for remaining Y")

**Escalation triggers (any of these → STOP and write spec):**

- Started as <3 files → Now touching 3+ files
- Started as single component → Now requires state/API changes
- Started as "copy existing pattern" → Now deviating from pattern
- Estimated 10 minutes → Already spent 30+ minutes

**"Almost done" is NOT an exception:**

There is NO completion percentage where you're "too far along" to need a spec.

- "I'm 90% done" / "99% done" / "almost finished" → STOP. Write spec for remaining work
- "Just one more function" / "just one more line" → STOP. If you're rationalizing, you need a spec
- "Writing spec takes longer than finishing" → STOP. Spec documents complexity for future developers

**Explicit examples that do NOT exempt you:**

- ❌ "Remaining 1% is trivial"
- ❌ "It's just a closing brace"
- ❌ "The overhead isn't worth it for this little"

**Why late-stage specs matter:** A spec written at 99% documents the complexity you discovered. It's a "complexity warning label" preventing future developers from assuming the task was trivial.

## Out-of-Sequence Recovery

**IF YOU ALREADY IMPLEMENTED BEFORE READING THIS SKILL:**

This is a sunk cost situation. The time spent is gone whether you keep or redo the code.

**Correct recovery path:**

1. Acknowledge: "Implementation happened out-of-sequence"
2. Delegate to code-reviewer (Opus) to review existing implementation
3. If major issues found: Redo with proper workflow (brainstormer → planner → scribe)
4. If minor issues only: Apply fixes via fixer and continue Build workflow from verification step
5. Document in stage file: "Implementation preceded workflow on [date], recovered via [action]"

**DO NOT:**

- Rationalize skipping remaining workflow steps
- Assume the premature implementation is correct
- Skip code review because "it's already written"
- Treat sunk cost as justification for shortcuts

---

## Phase Workflow

```
1. [CONDITIONAL: Planning]
   IF complex multi-file feature OR architectural change:
     → Delegate to planner (Opus) for detailed implementation spec
     → Planner MUST save spec to /tmp/spec-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md
   ELSE IF simple single-file OR straightforward change:
     → Delegate to planner-lite (Sonnet) for simple spec
     → Planner-lite MUST save spec to /tmp/spec-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md
   ELSE (trivial change):
     → Skip planner, main agent instructs scribe directly (no spec file needed)

2. Delegate to scribe (Haiku) to write code from spec file
   → Pass spec file path explicitly: "Read and implement: /tmp/spec-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md"

3. Add seed data if agreed in Design phase

4. Add placeholder stubs for related future features

5. Verify dev server works - feature must be testable

6. [PARALLEL] Delegate to verifier (Haiku) + tester (Haiku)
   Run build/lint/type-check AND tests in parallel

7. [IF verification fails] → Error handling flow (see epic-stage-workflow)

8. [LOOP steps 2-7 until green]

9. Delegate to doc-updater (Haiku) to update tracking documents:
   - Mark Build phase complete in STAGE-XXX-YYY.md
   - Update stage status in epic's EPIC-XXX.md table (MANDATORY)
```

## Planner Selection Criteria

**Use planner (Opus) when ANY of these apply:**

- Changes span 3+ files across packages (backend + frontend)
- Integration between systems (WebSocket, GraphQL, external APIs)
- Real-time features (WebSocket, SSE, polling)
- State management changes (Zustand stores, cache patterns)
- Database schema changes + service layer + resolvers
- New architectural patterns for the codebase

**CRITICAL: "Requirements are clear" does NOT mean "use planner-lite"**

- Requirements clarity is about WHAT to build
- Planner tier is about HOW MANY moving parts coordinate

**Example of Opus-level complexity:**

- "Add WebSocket notifications" touches 7+ files across backend/frontend with real-time state sync
- Even if requirements are crystal clear, the integration coordination requires Opus

**Example of Sonnet-level simplicity:**

- "Add loading spinner to existing button" is 1-2 files with no integration

**Skip planner when:**

- Single-file change with clear requirements
- Bug fix with known solution
- Simple config or documentation change

## "Trivial" Means Literally Trivial

Trivial ONLY includes:

- [ ] Single-line changes (typo, constant value)
- [ ] Documentation-only edits
- [ ] Config file tweaks with no code impact

**NOT trivial (requires planner-lite at minimum):**

- Adding UI elements (even "just" a spinner)
- CSS changes affecting layout or spacing
- Any change requiring verification testing
- "Quick" features (if it needs testing, it needs planning)

**Test**: Would verifier/tester need to run? → Not trivial → Write spec

## Scaffolding and Stub Stages

When implementing scaffolding or stub stages (stages that create structure for future work):

### Forward-Looking Code Requires Explanation

If you're adding code that will be used in a **future stage**, add an explicit comment:

```typescript
// SCAFFOLDING: Used in STAGE-003-002 for entity selection
onSelect?: (entity: Entity) => void;

// STUB: Real implementation in STAGE-006-001
export function processRequest(): void {
  // Placeholder - validates integration shape only
  return;
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- Code reviewers see "unused" code and flag for removal
- Future implementers don't understand intent
- Premature deletion breaks future stages

### Comment Patterns

**For props/parameters needed later:**
```typescript
// Used in [STAGE-ID]: [brief purpose]
onSelect?: (id: string) => void;
```

**For stub implementations:**
```typescript
// STUB: Real implementation in [STAGE-ID]
// Current behavior: [what it does now]
// Future behavior: [what it will do]
```

**For scaffolding structure:**
```typescript
// SCAFFOLDING: Framework for [feature] implemented in [STAGE-ID]
```

### When Implementing Stubs

1. **Validate shape, not behavior**: Tests should verify function signature, not logic
2. **Comment test intent**:
   ```typescript
   // SCAFFOLD TEST: Validates integration shape only
   // Real behavior tests added in STAGE-006-001
   ```
3. **Reference future stage** in implementation and tests

### Code Review Awareness

Code reviewers should:
- Check stage docs for forward references before flagging "unused" code
- Verify scaffolding comments reference valid future stages
- Ensure stub tests clearly indicate they're testing shape, not behavior

## Phase Gates Checklist

Before completing Build phase, verify:

- [ ] Implementation spec created (planner OR planner-lite OR direct for trivial)
- [ ] Code written via scribe
- [ ] Seed data added (if agreed in Design)
- [ ] Placeholder stubs added for related future features
- [ ] Dev server verified working
- [ ] **Verification fully green** (zero errors, zero warnings, all tests passing)
- [ ] Tracking documents updated via doc-updater:
  - Build phase marked complete in stage file
  - Epic stage status updated (MANDATORY)

## Time Pressure Does NOT Override Exit Gates

**IF USER SAYS:** "We're behind schedule" / "Just ship it" / "Go fast" / "Skip the formality"

**YOU MUST STILL:**

- Complete ALL exit gate steps in order
- Invoke lessons-learned skill (even if "nothing to capture")
- Invoke journal skill (even if brief)
- Update ALL tracking documents via doc-updater

**Time pressure is not a workflow exception.** Fast delivery comes from efficient subagent coordination, not from skipping safety checks. Exit gates take 2-3 minutes total.

---

## Pre-Flight Verification

Before exiting Build phase, run full test suite to detect pre-existing failures:

**Why this matters:**
- Incremental testing during Build catches new bugs, not pre-existing ones
- Pre-existing failures discovered in Finalize cause cascading fix-verify cycles
- Pattern from game-master: "What should have been 'fix 3 issues → verify → done' became 30+ minute debugging session"

**Workflow:**
1. Run full test suite: `npm test` (or project equivalent)
2. Categorize failures:
   - New failures (from your implementation) - already fixed during Build
   - Pre-existing failures (existed before your work)
3. **MANDATORY: Fix ALL pre-existing failures before exiting Build**
   - Per CLAUDE.md: "Pre-existing failures that block verification are your responsibility"
   - Do NOT defer to Finalize - fix now while context is fresh

**Common rationalizations (and counters):**

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "Tests passed incrementally, no need for full run" | Incremental tests only cover changed code. Pre-existing failures in other areas remain hidden. |
| "Pre-existing failures can be fixed in Finalize" | Finalize is for verification, not debugging. Discovering 8+ failures during Finalize causes cascading fix-verify cycles. |
| "Not my code, not my problem" | Per CLAUDE.md: "Pre-existing failures that block verification are your responsibility to fix." |
| "This will delay Build completion" | Fixing now (5-10 minutes) prevents Finalize thrash (30+ minutes). Net time savings. |

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Full test suite executed
- [ ] All failures investigated and categorized
- [ ] All pre-existing failures fixed (no deferrals)
- [ ] Test suite passing (or only expected failures documented in KNOWN_ISSUES.md)

**Expected outcome:**

Finalize phase becomes pure verification (run tests, commit, done) instead of debugging session. Pattern: "Finalize takes 5 minutes, not 30+."

---

## Phase Exit Gate (MANDATORY)

### Verification Gate (REQUIRED FIRST)

**CRITICAL: Before ANY exit gate steps, verification MUST be fully green.**

Run verifier (Haiku) and confirm:

- [ ] **Zero errors** (type errors, lint errors, build errors)
- [ ] **Zero warnings** treated as acceptable
- [ ] **All tests passing** (unit, integration, e2e as applicable)

### Schema Change Verification (REQUIRED)

**If this stage or any recent stage modified:**

- Prisma schema (new fields, changed types, new models)
- TypeScript type definitions (interfaces, types)
- Shared interfaces/types used across packages
- GraphQL schema definitions

**BEFORE declaring Build complete, you MUST:**

1. **Run `pnpm type-check` across ALL packages** (not just packages you touched)
   - Schema changes cascade to packages you didn't modify
   - Tests in other packages may reference changed types via mocks

2. **Search for stale test mocks/fixtures:**
   ```bash
   # Find mock objects that may reference the changed type
   grep -r "mockEntity\|entityMock\|createEntity" packages/*/src/**/*.test.* --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
   ```

3. **Verify mocks include new required fields:**
   - Optional fields (e.g., `field?: Type`) may still type-check with old mocks
   - But mocks missing the field don't reflect production behavior
   - Update mocks to include new fields for realistic test data

**Why this matters:**

- Schema changes in Stage N break mocks in Stage N+2
- "All tests passing" with stale mocks = false confidence
- Catching this at Build exit prevents blocked downstream stages

**Common Rationalizations (All Invalid):**

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "Verifier returned green" | Verifier checks touched packages. Other packages may have stale mocks. |
| "It's an optional field" | Optional fields type-check, but mocks should reflect realistic data. |
| "Tests are passing" | Tests pass with incomplete mock data. Doesn't mean mocks are correct. |
| "I only touched backend" | Frontend tests may mock backend types. Check ALL packages. |
| "This is a documentation-only stage" | Schema changes from recent stages affect all packages. Run full verification. |

**If verifier returns ANY errors or warnings:**

1. **Stop immediately** - Do NOT proceed to exit gate steps
2. **Categorize errors**: New (your work) vs pre-existing (inherited)
3. **Apply Pre-existing Error Protocol** (see below)
4. **Fix ALL errors** - new AND pre-existing
5. **Re-run verifier** until fully green
6. **Only then proceed** to exit gate steps below

**Type errors accumulate exponentially. 1 skipped verification = 9x cleanup in next stage.**

There is NO "override" status. Either fully green or phase is blocked.

### Debugger Agent Escalation

When encountering errors during Build phase, select the appropriate debugger:

| Error Type | Start With | Escalate To |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Runtime errors (null ref, type errors at runtime) | debugger-lite (Sonnet) | - |
| Test failures with clear stack traces | debugger-lite (Sonnet) | debugger if 2+ attempts fail |
| Build/compilation errors | debugger (Opus) | - |
| Toolchain issues (bundler, transpiler, loader) | debugger (Opus) | - |
| Module resolution / import errors | debugger (Opus) | - |
| CI/environment configuration | debugger (Opus) | - |

**Escalation trigger**: If debugger-lite fails to identify root cause after 2 attempts, escalate to debugger (Opus).

**Common Rationalizations (All Invalid):**

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "Config errors are straightforward" | Toolchain subtleties (path resolution, loader config) need Opus-level reasoning |
| "Module resolution is just config" | Bundler/transpiler interactions are complex - use Opus |
| "I'll try debugger-lite one more time" | After 2 failures, escalate - more of the same won't work |
| "Opus is overkill" | Wasted cycles with wrong agent costs more than using Opus upfront |

**Pattern from journal**: debugger-lite missed compiler/tooling issues that required Opus-level analysis.

### Pre-existing Error Protocol

**Discovery:** You run verifier and find errors that existed before your work started.

**Identification:** Use `git blame` on error locations to confirm they pre-date your branch.

**Options (choose ONE):**

1. **Fix now** (recommended):
   - Fix the pre-existing error as part of this stage
   - Document fix in commit message: "Fixed inherited error: [description]"
   - Proceed when verifier is green

2. **Document + Block** (if fix requires architectural changes):
   - Add TODO comment at error location:
     ```
     // TODO: [ERROR] Inherited from STAGE-XXX-XXX [brief description]
     // Requires [architectural change] - blocked on [dependency]
     ```
   - Create follow-up stage/task for the fix
   - Notify previous stage owner via tracking docs
   - **Block current stage completion** until decision made with user

**NOT an option:**

- ❌ Mark stage complete with "documented override"
- ❌ Treat warnings as acceptable because "they're not errors"
- ❌ Ignore pre-existing errors as "not my responsibility"
- ❌ Defer all errors to future stages without explicit approval
- ❌ Add @ts-ignore/@ts-expect-error to suppress errors
- ❌ Add files to .eslintignore to hide lint errors
- ❌ Add .skip to failing tests

**Reality:** You inherit the debt when you touch the code. Fix it or block completion.

### Common Rationalizations (All Invalid)

Watch for these thought patterns - they ALL lead to technical debt:

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "These are just test errors" | Test errors become production errors. Fix tests. |
| "Pre-existing, not my problem" | You inherited the debt. Fix it or block completion. |
| "Feature works, verification is bureaucracy" | 1 skip = 9x cleanup in next stage. Verification saves time. |
| "Warnings aren't errors" | Warnings accumulate. Treat as errors or they multiply. |
| "Authority says it's fine" | Authority can defer technical debt, not override it. Still needs TODO + tracking. |
| "I'm 90% done, verification would restart me" | Incomplete work + broken verification = 0% done. Run verifier. |
| "My code passes, these are someone else's errors" | Your stage, your responsibility. Fix or block. |
| "I can add @ts-ignore to make it green" | Suppression hides bugs. Fix the error, don't silence it. |
| "I'll .skip the failing tests" | Skipped tests don't pass. They hide failures. Fix or block. |

### Exit Gate Steps (After Green Verification)

Once verification is **fully green** with zero errors and warnings, complete these steps IN ORDER:

1. Update stage tracking file (mark Build phase complete)
2. Update epic tracking file (update stage status in table)
3. Use Skill tool to invoke `lessons-learned`
4. Use Skill tool to invoke `journal`

**Why this order?**

- Steps 1-2: Establish facts (phase done, status updated)
- Steps 3-4: Capture learnings and feelings based on the now-complete phase

Lessons and journal need the full phase context, including final status updates. Running them before status updates means they lack complete information.

After completing all exit gate steps, use Skill tool to invoke `phase-refinement` to begin the next phase.

**DO NOT skip any exit gate step. DO NOT proceed until all steps are done.**

**DO NOT proceed to Refinement phase until exit gate is complete.** This includes:

- Announcing "proceeding to Refinement"
- Starting user testing discussions
- Thinking about what to test
- Invoking phase-refinement skill

**Complete ALL exit gate steps FIRST. Then invoke phase-refinement.**
