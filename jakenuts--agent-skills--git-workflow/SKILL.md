# Git Workflow Automation

Automated helpers for common git workflows and branch management tasks.

## No Setup Required

This skill uses native git commands and bash scripts - no additional tools or SDKs needed. Works immediately in any environment with git installed.

## Quick Start

### Create Feature Branch

Create a new feature branch following naming conventions:

```bash
# Interactive: prompts for feature name
cd /path/to/repo
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/create-feature-branch.sh

# Non-interactive: specify feature name
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/create-feature-branch.sh "add-user-auth"
# Creates: feature/add-user-auth
```

### Clean Up Merged Branches

Remove local branches that have been merged to main/master:

```bash
cd /path/to/repo

# Preview what would be deleted (dry run)
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/cleanup-merged-branches.sh --dry-run

# Actually delete merged branches
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/cleanup-merged-branches.sh

# Force cleanup (skip confirmations)
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/cleanup-merged-branches.sh --force
```

### Interactive Rebase Helper

Simplified interactive rebase with common options:

```bash
cd /path/to/repo

# Rebase last 3 commits
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/interactive-rebase.sh 3

# Rebase since a specific commit
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/interactive-rebase.sh abc123

# Rebase onto main
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/interactive-rebase.sh main
```

## Available Scripts

All scripts are located in the skill's `scripts/` directory and can be run with bash.

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `create-feature-branch.sh` | Create feature branches with naming conventions | `bash script.sh [feature-name]` |
| `cleanup-merged-branches.sh` | Clean up merged branches | `bash script.sh [--dry-run\|--force]` |
| `interactive-rebase.sh` | Interactive rebase helper | `bash script.sh <commit-count\|ref>` |

## Workflow Examples

### Starting a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Ensure main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/create-feature-branch.sh "user-authentication"

# 3. Work on feature...
# (make commits)

# 4. Push when ready
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication
```

### Cleaning Up After PR Merge

```bash
# 1. Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Preview what will be deleted
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/cleanup-merged-branches.sh --dry-run

# 3. Clean up merged branches
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/cleanup-merged-branches.sh
```

### Squashing Commits Before PR

```bash
# Squash last 5 commits into one
bash ~/.claude/skills/git-workflow/scripts/interactive-rebase.sh 5

# In the editor that opens:
# - Change 'pick' to 'squash' (or 's') for commits 2-5
# - Keep first commit as 'pick'
# - Save and close

# Then edit the combined commit message
```

## Safety Features

All scripts include:
- **Dry run mode** - Preview changes before applying
- **Confirmation prompts** - Ask before destructive operations
- **Current branch protection** - Won't delete the branch you're on
- **Main/master protection** - Won't delete main branches
- **Uncommitted changes check** - Warns if working directory is dirty

## Prerequisites

- **git** - Installed and configured (available in most dev environments)
- **bash** - Standard shell (available on Linux, macOS, and Git Bash on Windows)

No additional tools, SDKs, or environment variables required.
