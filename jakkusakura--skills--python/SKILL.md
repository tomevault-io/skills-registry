# Python (Strict)

Use this skill when the user wants strict, explicit Python code with low ambiguity and fail-fast behavior.

## Core Rules
- Put all imports at the top of the file.
- Never use `getattr` or `hasattr`.
- Never use `isinstance` type checks.
- Do not introduce implicit defaults for required data paths.
- Avoid unnecessary `try/except`; only keep exception handling for a clearly required fallback or boundary.

## Implementation Pattern
1) Validate required keys/attributes explicitly.
2) Use direct indexing/attribute access for required fields.
3) For optional branches, use explicit `if "key" in obj` checks.
4) Prefer fail-fast errors over silent fallback behavior.
5) Keep control flow straightforward; avoid defensive swallowing of errors.

## Review Checklist
- Imports are module-level and grouped at file top.
- No reflective access helpers (`getattr`, `hasattr`).
- No runtime type filtering with `isinstance`.
- No hidden default values for required fields.
- Exception blocks are minimal and justified.
- Errors are explicit and actionable.
