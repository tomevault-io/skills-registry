# Rust Coding Style

Apply these rules when writing or reviewing Rust code. Keep decisions consistent and terse.

## Examples
- "Pick an error strategy for this new Rust binary."
- "Decide API shape and module layout for this Rust crate."

## Guidelines

## Control flow and logging
- Never use a fallback branch unless explicitly instructed.
- Never ignore a `match` branch unless explicitly instructed. For unhandled events, use `tracing` with at least `warn!` and include a `{:?}` debug of the event.

## Placeholders and stubs
- When placing placeholders or stubs, use `todo!()`. Do not create empty files.

## Language
- Do not use the word "plumbing".

## Error handling
- New app: prefer `thiserror`.
- IO-only code: prefer `std::io::Result`.
- Existing `eyre`/`anyhow`: stick with it.
- New library: prefer `thiserror`.
- Within a codebase, keep the existing error crate unless you have a strong reason to change.

## API design
- Public API: return `Result<T, E>` and avoid panics.
- Prefer newtypes over type aliases for invariants.
- Use `impl Trait` in return position for iterator APIs.
- For many optional params: use a builder.
- Config load API: prefer free function `fn load(path: impl AsRef<Path>) -> Result<Config, Error>`.
- Iterator exposure: prefer `fn iter(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &Item>`.
- Optional config fields: use `#[serde(default)]` and concrete fields; avoid `Option<T>` in the struct.
- Validation on construction: prefer builder with `build() -> Result<Self, Error>`.
- Never implement From/TryFrom for wrapper newtypes. Unless they are Error types.

## Code structure
- Small module: use `mod.rs`; large module: use `mod/` with `mod.rs`.
- Default to feature-based grouping in Rust (e.g., `src/foo/mod.rs`).
- Only use layer-based grouping for legacy or mandated layouts.
- Use `mod.rs` to curate public APIs rather than re-exporting entire trees, unless the mods are private.

## Naming
- Use singular for a thing/type, plural for a collection/module.
- File naming: `client.rs` for a single client type, `clients/` for a collection.

## API style: free functions vs structs
- Prefer `struct` + `impl` when there is shared state, configuration, or invariants.
- Prefer struct if a function has only the struct as parameter, and tie closely to the struct's purpose.
- Prefer free functions for stateless operations.
- Avoid OOP-style class hierarchies; use traits for behavior and composition.
- Use a builder when construction has multiple stages or invariant checks.

## Ownership and lifetimes
- Prefer owning types in public APIs; borrow internally where possible.
- Avoid exposing explicit lifetimes unless they simplify the API.

## Async boundaries
- Keep async at the edges; core logic stays sync when possible.
- Prefer explicit `async fn` in public APIs; avoid boxed futures unless needed.
- Use `tokio` only when async IO or concurrency pays for the complexity.

## Performance
- Prefer `cargo criterion` over `cargo bench`.
- Use `cargo flamegraph` for CPU hotspots.
- Use `perf` + flamegraph for low-level profiling on Linux.
- Use `samply` for sampling + flamegraphs on macOS/Linux.
- Use `tokio-console` for async task/latency insight.
- Use `cargo llvm-lines` for codegen size hotspots.
- Use `cargo bloat` for binary size breakdown.

## Testing
- In-file unit tests for local behavior and edge cases.
- `tests/` for integration tests across modules/crates.
- Shell integration tests for CLI workflows.
- Smoke tests for minimal end-to-end coverage.
- Mock tests when dependencies are expensive or flaky.
- Fuzz tests for parsers, serializers, and input handling.
- Use Podman Compose for containerized integration tests.
