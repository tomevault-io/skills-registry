# jal-co/ui Component Docs Skill

Use this skill when creating, editing, or reviewing component documentation in jalco ui.

## Canonical reference

The single source of truth for docs page structure, section order, and formatting rules is:

**`.pi/references/docs-component-format-spec.md`**

The agent MUST read it before writing or updating any component docs. This skill provides workflow guidance and review steps, not a parallel format definition.

</overview>

<context>

## Required reading before changes

1. `.pi/references/docs-component-format-spec.md` — page anatomy, section order, writing rules
2. `AGENTS.md` — project conventions, quality bar, comment style
3. `.pi/skills/jalco-shadcn-registry/SKILL.md` — for registry-backed items

The agent MUST also inspect:
- similar component docs already in the repo
- the source component and its example/demo files
- any related registry metadata

## What this skill covers

- writing new component docs
- revising existing component docs
- reviewing docs for clarity and consistency
- writing or refining descriptions
- keeping registry-backed descriptions in sync

</context>

<workflow>

## Workflow

1. Read `.pi/references/docs-component-format-spec.md` and this skill.
2. Inspect similar docs pages in `app/docs/components/`.
3. Review the component source, public API, and demo files.
4. Create or update the page using `ComponentDocsPage` from `components/docs/component-docs-page.tsx`.
5. Supply: `title`, `description`, `registryName`, `sourceFiles`, `preview`, `usage`.
6. Add Examples, API Reference, Notes, or When to use sections as children — only when justified.
7. Sync description and naming with `registry.json` and `lib/docs.ts`.
8. Ensure a catalog card preview exists at `components/docs/previews/<registry-name>.tsx` with key variants.
9. Ensure the sidebar nav entry exists in `lib/docs.ts` with `badge: "New"` and `badgeAdded` set for new components.
10. Run `pnpm previews:generate` if the card preview file was created or renamed.
11. Ensure screenshots exist at `public/previews/<name>-dark.png` and `<name>-light.png`.
12. Review using the checklist in `.pi/references/docs-component-format-spec.md`.

</workflow>

<rules>

## Quick rules

These are the rules most frequently needed during docs work. For full details, see the format spec.

### Descriptions

- MUST be one sentence, capability-first
- MUST NOT start with "A", "An", or "A React component for..."
- MUST NOT contain subjective adjectives
- MUST match across: page metadata, ComponentDocsPage props, registry.json

### Usage section

- MUST include import and minimal usage snippets via `CodeLine`
- Server/client rendering context MUST go here, not in Notes
- The first example SHOULD be minimal — layer complexity in Examples

### Examples

- MUST use `VariantGrid` with labeled items
- MUST group by meaning: Variants, Sizes, Languages, etc.
- MUST NOT call everything a variant
- SHOULD use realistic content

### Notes

- MUST contain only caveats, limitations, and external service behavior
- MUST NOT include architecture decisions, feature highlights, or rendering context
- SHOULD be brief

### Bundled exports

- MUST use `installNote` to explain the relationship
- MUST set `bundledIn` on the nav item in `lib/docs.ts`

</rules>

<quality-checklist>

## Review checklist

Use the checklist in `.pi/references/docs-component-format-spec.md` before shipping any docs page.

Key things to verify:
1. Page uses `ComponentDocsPage`
2. Description matches across all surfaces
3. Preview is realistic
4. Usage includes runtime context
5. Examples are labeled correctly
6. Notes contains only caveats
7. Sidebar entry is correct (title, order, bundledIn)
8. Catalog card preview exists at `components/docs/previews/<registry-name>.tsx`

</quality-checklist>
