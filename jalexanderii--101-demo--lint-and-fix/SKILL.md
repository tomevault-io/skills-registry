# Lint and Fix

Run linters for both backend and frontend, inspect issues, and fix any auto-fixable problems.

## Workflow

1. **Run backend linter** (ruff)
2. **Run frontend linter** (eslint)
3. **Inspect output** for errors and warnings
4. **Fix auto-fixable issues** automatically
5. **Report remaining issues** that require manual fixes

## Backend Linting

The backend uses `ruff` for linting and formatting.

**Commands:**
```bash
cd backend
ruff check --fix src
ruff format src
```

**What it does:**
- `ruff check --fix`: Checks for linting issues and automatically fixes what it can
- `ruff format`: Formats code according to project standards

**Expected output:**
- If issues are fixed: Shows what was fixed
- If issues remain: Lists remaining issues that need manual attention
- If clean: No output or "All checks passed"

## Frontend Linting

The frontend uses `eslint` for linting.

**Commands:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint -- --fix
```

**What it does:**
- Runs eslint with auto-fix enabled
- Fixes formatting and simple rule violations automatically

**Expected output:**
- If issues are fixed: Shows what was fixed
- If issues remain: Lists remaining issues with file paths and line numbers
- If clean: "✔ No ESLint warnings or errors"

## Execution Steps

1. **Run backend linter:**
   ```bash
   cd backend && ruff check --fix src && ruff format src
   ```

2. **Run frontend linter:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run lint -- --fix
   ```

3. **Inspect results:**
   - Review any remaining errors or warnings
   - Note which files have issues
   - Identify patterns in remaining issues

4. **Fix remaining issues:**
   - For backend: Manually address any ruff errors that couldn't be auto-fixed
   - For frontend: Manually address any eslint errors that couldn't be auto-fixed
   - Use `read_lints` tool to get detailed diagnostics if needed

5. **Verify fixes:**
   - Re-run linters to confirm all issues are resolved
   - Check that no new issues were introduced

## Handling Remaining Issues

If linters report issues that can't be auto-fixed:

1. **Read detailed diagnostics:**
   ```bash
   read_lints paths/to/problematic/files
   ```

2. **Fix systematically:**
   - Address one file at a time
   - Fix errors before warnings
   - Re-run linter after each fix to verify

3. **Common fixes:**
   - **Backend (ruff)**: Import sorting, unused imports, line length, type hints
   - **Frontend (eslint)**: Unused variables, missing dependencies in hooks, TypeScript errors

## Notes

- Always run from the project root or navigate to the appropriate directory
- Both linters support auto-fix, so most issues should be resolved automatically
- If a linter reports many issues, fix them incrementally and re-run
- Some issues may require code changes beyond formatting (e.g., logic fixes for TypeScript errors)
