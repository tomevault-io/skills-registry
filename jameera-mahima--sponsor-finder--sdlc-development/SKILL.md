# SDLC Development Skill

## When to Use This Skill
- Implementing new features
- Writing code
- Building functionality
- Refactoring existing code
- Adding new components

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setup
- **Review specification:** Understand what to build
- **Create feature branch:** \git checkout -b feature/name\
- **Set up environment:** Install dependencies
- **Review existing code:** Understand current patterns

### 2. Implementation
Follow these principles:

**Code Quality:**
- Write clean, readable code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow project conventions
- Add comments for complex logic

**Error Handling:**
- Handle expected errors gracefully
- Provide helpful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Don't crash on edge cases

**Project Patterns:**
- Match existing code style
- Reuse existing components
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Keep functions small and focused

### 3. Testing
- **Write unit tests:** Test individual functions
- **Test edge cases:** Empty inputs, null values, large datasets
- **Manual testing:** Actually try the feature
- **Integration testing:** Test with other components

### 4. Documentation
- **Update README:** Add new feature to docs
- **Add code comments:** Explain why, not what
- **Document API changes:** Update interface docs
- **Create examples:** Show how to use the feature

## Code Quality Checklist

Before committing:
- [ ] Code follows style guide
- [ ] Has error handling
- [ ] Includes tests
- [ ] Documented (README + comments)
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use config)
- [ ] No console.log / debug code
- [ ] Tested manually
- [ ] Git commit message is clear

## Example Usage

Input: "Implement CSV export for sponsor results"

Output:
- Complete implementation
- Unit tests
- Documentation
- Usage examples
