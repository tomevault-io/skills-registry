# Feature PRD Workflow

Guide the user through creating a well-defined feature PRD (Product Requirements Document) before implementation.

**Important:** A PRD describes **one feature** — a single, buildable piece of work. If the user's idea is bigger than one feature (multiple epics, many capabilities), they should run `/agentic-coding:writing-vision-briefs` first to break it down. This skill takes one feature as input, not an entire vision.

## When to Use This Skill

- User wants to build a new feature
- User mentions "create a spec", "create a PRD", "new feature", or "feature PRD"
- User wants to define requirements before coding
- User has completed a Vision Brief and is ready to spec out one of the features from the breakdown

## Workflow Overview

| Phase | Goal |
|-------|------|
| 1. Define | Create PRD in a `specs/` directory |
| 2. Stress-test | Review for gaps and ambiguities |
| 3. Track | GitHub issue with `type:feature` label |
| 4. Handoff | Move to plan mode for implementation planning |

---

## Phase 1: Define the Feature

**First, figure out where the user is coming from:**

**Path A — Coming from a Vision Brief (recommended flow):**
If the user references a Vision Brief or a specific feature from a breakdown (e.g., "Write a PRD for email verification from specs/onboarding-vision.md"):

1. Read the Vision Brief
2. Find the specific feature in the Feature Breakdown section
3. Systematically translate each Vision Brief section into PRD content using this mapping:

| Vision Brief Section | PRD Section | How to Translate |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| The Problem | Motivation | Scope the problem to this specific feature. Keep quantification from the brief. |
| Who Feels It | User Stories | Use as the user type(s) in story format. |
| Stakeholders | (note in issue) | Carry over to the GitHub issue body for review assignments. |
| Current State | Motivation | Add as context for why the current state is insufficient. |
| Alternatives Considered | Design Constraints | Note what was ruled out and why — these become constraints. |
| Strategic Context | Motivation | Include urgency signals that apply to this feature. |
| The Vision | Summary | Scope the vision statement down to this one feature. |
| Key Capabilities | User Stories + AC | Map relevant capabilities to stories with `[MUST]`/`[SHOULD]`/`[COULD]` criteria. |
| Inspiration | UI/UX Requirements | Pull in relevant design references for user-facing features. |
| What Success Looks Like | Success Metrics | Translate early signals and real outcomes into measurable metrics for this feature. |
| Risks & Assumptions | Open Questions | Surface risks that apply to this feature as questions to resolve. |
| Dependencies | Dependencies & Prerequisites | Carry over dependencies relevant to this feature. |
| Constraints & Context | Design Constraints + NFRs | Split into design constraints and non-functional requirements. |
| Future Considerations | Future Considerations | Carry over items relevant to this feature's domain. |

4. Confirm with the user: "I'm writing the PRD for **[Feature Name]** from your Vision Brief. I've pulled in the problem, users, and relevant capabilities. Anything you'd change before I draft the full PRD?"

**Path B — Starting fresh (no Vision Brief):**
If the user doesn't mention a Vision Brief:

1. Ask: "Do you have a Vision Brief for this idea? If so, point me to it and I'll use it as a head start. If not, no worries — I'll walk you through the questions."
2. If they provide one, follow Path A above
3. If they don't have one, check the scope: does their idea sound like one feature, or something bigger?
    - If it sounds like one feature, proceed with the questions below
    - If it sounds bigger (multiple capabilities, multiple user types, multiple workflows), suggest they start with a Vision Brief first: "This sounds like it might be bigger than one feature. Want to run `/agentic-coding:writing-vision-briefs` first to break it into pieces? That way we can spec each piece clearly."

Ask the user these questions to understand the feature:

1. **What feature are you building?** (one sentence)
2. **What problem does it solve?** (why does this need to exist?)
3. **Who are the users?** (user type for user stories)
4. **What should happen?** (key behaviors/requirements)
5. **What is explicitly NOT part of this feature?** (scope boundaries — prevents scope creep)
6. **Are there performance, security, or accessibility requirements?** (e.g., response time targets, auth requirements, WCAG compliance). If the user says "nothing special," that's fine — note defaults and move on.
7. **What should happen when things go wrong?** (error states — invalid input, network failure, missing data, permission denied). If this is a simple feature, a brief answer is fine.
8. **Does this change existing behavior, data, or URLs?** (migration needs — if yes, we'll need a migration and rollback plan). If no, skip the Migration section in the PRD.
9. **What does this depend on?** (other features, data sources, APIs, tools that must exist first). If nothing, skip the Dependencies section.
10. **How will you measure success after launch?** (primary metric, what to track, when to evaluate). If the user isn't sure, help them define at least one leading indicator.

Then create a PRD file. Use this structure for the PRD:

### PRD Template

```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

**Epic:** [Epic Name] (issue #XX) — omit if standalone feature
**Vision Brief:** specs/[name]-vision.md — omit if no Vision Brief exists

## Summary
One-sentence description of the feature.

> *Example: "Add email verification to the signup flow so new accounts are confirmed before accessing the workspace."*

## Motivation
Why this feature needs to exist. What problem it solves. Include quantification where available.

> *Example: "12% of new accounts are created with invalid or disposable email addresses, generating ~40 bounced welcome emails per week and inflating our active user count. This wastes marketing spend on unreachable users and skews our activation metrics."*

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 1: [Short title]
**As a** [user type], **I want** [goal] **so that** [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `[MUST]` [Yes/no verifiable statement]
2. `[MUST]` [Another verifiable statement]
3. `[SHOULD]` [A desirable but non-blocking criterion]

> *Example:*
> ### Story 1: Email verification on signup
> **As a** new user, **I want** to verify my email during signup **so that** my account is secured and I receive important notifications.
>
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
> 1. `[MUST]` Verification email is sent within 30 seconds of form submission
> 2. `[MUST]` Clicking the verification link activates the account and redirects to the dashboard
> 3. `[MUST]` Unverified accounts cannot access workspace features
> 4. `[SHOULD]` "Resend verification" button is available on the pending screen
> 5. `[COULD]` Verification link includes the user's name in the email greeting

### Story 2: [Short title]
**As a** [user type], **I want** [goal] **so that** [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `[MUST]` [Yes/no verifiable statement]

### Global Acceptance Criteria
_Criteria that apply across all stories (e.g., performance, accessibility). Omit if none._
1. `[MUST]` [Yes/no verifiable statement]

## Scope

### In Scope
- [What this feature includes]

### Out of Scope
- [What this feature explicitly does NOT include]

## Approach
High-level technical approach and key design decisions. Keep this brief — detailed implementation planning happens in plan mode.

## Non-Functional Requirements
_Include only categories that are relevant to this feature. Omit categories that don't apply._

- **Performance:** [Response time targets, throughput requirements, resource limits]
- **Security:** [Authentication, authorization, data protection, input validation]
- **Accessibility:** [WCAG level, keyboard navigation, screen reader support]
- **Scalability:** [Expected load, growth projections, scaling approach]
- **Reliability:** [Uptime targets, graceful degradation, retry behavior]
- **Compatibility:** [Browsers, devices, OS versions, API versions]

## Error States
_What should happen when things go wrong? Cover the most likely failure scenarios._

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| [Error scenario 1] | [What the user sees/what happens] |
| [Error scenario 2] | [What the user sees/what happens] |

> *Example:*
> | Scenario | Expected Behavior |
> |----------|-------------------|
> | Invalid email format entered | Inline validation message: "Please enter a valid email address." Form does not submit. |
> | Verification link expired (>24h) | Landing page shows "Link expired" with a "Resend verification" button. |
> | Email delivery fails | System retries once after 5 minutes. If still failed, logs error and shows "Didn't receive it?" prompt. |

## Success Metrics & Instrumentation
_How will you know this feature is working? Define what to measure and when to evaluate._

- **Primary metric:** [The one number that tells you this worked]
- **Secondary metrics:** [Supporting indicators]
- **Events to track:** [Specific user actions or system events to instrument]
- **Evaluation timeline:** [When to check — e.g., "2 weeks post-launch for early signal, 6 weeks for full assessment"]

## Dependencies & Prerequisites
_Omit this section if there are no dependencies._

- [Feature, data source, API, or tool that must exist first]
- [Decision that must be made before implementation]

## Migration & Rollback
_Omit this section if the feature doesn't change existing behavior, data, or URLs._

- **Migration plan:** [How existing users/data transition to the new behavior]
- **Rollback plan:** [How to revert if something goes wrong]
- **Backwards compatibility:** [What stays the same for existing users during transition]

## UI/UX Requirements
_Omit this section for non-user-facing features (APIs, background jobs, infrastructure)._

- **Key interactions:** [Primary user flows and interaction patterns]
- **Copy & messaging:** [Key labels, error messages, confirmation text]
- **Responsive behavior:** [How it adapts across screen sizes, if applicable]
- **Design references:** [Links to wireframes, mockups, or inspiration screenshots]

## Design Constraints
Constraints the implementation must respect — technical boundaries, conventions, and decisions that limit how the feature can be built. This is NOT an implementation plan.

- [Constraint 1 — e.g., "Must use the existing auth middleware, not a custom solution"]
- [Constraint 2 — e.g., "Must work without JavaScript for core functionality"]
- [Constraint 3 — e.g., "Must not introduce new runtime dependencies"]

## Verification
Step-by-step instructions to verify the feature works end-to-end after implementation. Cover the happy path and at least one error/edge case.

## Open Questions
- [Any unresolved decisions or questions]

## Future Considerations
_Ideas that came up during requirements gathering but are out of scope for this feature. A parking lot for good ideas worth remembering._

- [Future idea 1]
- [Future idea 2]

## Revision History
_Track significant changes to this PRD after initial draft._

| Date | Change | Author |
|------|--------|--------|
| [date] | Initial draft | [name] |
```

### Output Location

Choose the PRD location based on what exists in the repo:
1. If a `specs/` directory exists, use `specs/[feature-name]-prd.md`
2. If a `docs/specs/` directory exists, use `docs/specs/[feature-name]-prd.md`
3. If the repo's CLAUDE.md specifies a spec output location, use that
4. Otherwise, create `specs/[feature-name]-prd.md`

### Writing User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

Each user story gets its own acceptance criteria directly beneath it. This keeps requirements traceable — you can verify which criteria map to which user goal without jumping between sections.

**Story guidelines:**
- Write one story per distinct user goal (not one per persona doing the same thing)
- Different personas with different goals get separate stories
- A story without acceptance criteria is incomplete
- If a single requirement covers all stories (e.g., "Page loads in under 2 seconds"), place it in the **Global Acceptance Criteria** subsection after the last story

**Acceptance criteria rules:**
- Use numbered list (not checkboxes)
- Write yes/no verifiable statements
- Tag each criterion with priority: `[MUST]` (required for launch), `[SHOULD]` (important but not blocking), or `[COULD]` (nice to have, build if time permits)
- Focus on *what*, not *how*
- Use active voice ("Error message is displayed" not "User sees error")
- Include concrete expected values when possible
- Each criterion must be testable by running a specific command, visiting a URL, or checking a specific output

---

## Phase 2: Stress-Test the PRD

After drafting the PRD, review it critically:

> "Let me review this PRD critically. What edge cases are missing? Which acceptance criteria are ambiguous?"

Check for:

1. **Story-criteria alignment** — Is every user story covered by at least one acceptance criterion? Is there an acceptance criterion that doesn't map to any story? (Orphaned criteria signal possible scope creep.)
2. **Testability** — Can each acceptance criterion be verified with a specific command, URL visit, or observable output? If not, make it more concrete.
3. **Scope boundaries** — Are the "Out of Scope" items specific enough to reject future feature requests? Would a new team member know where this feature stops?
4. **Edge cases** — What happens with empty inputs, unauthorized users, network failures, or concurrent actions?
5. **Verification completeness** — Does the Verification section cover the happy path AND at least one error case?
6. **Open questions** — Are all open questions truly unresolved, or can any be decided now?
7. **Non-functional requirements** — Are performance, security, and accessibility needs captured? Even a simple "no special requirements" is better than silence.
8. **Dependencies** — Are all prerequisites listed? Would someone picking this up cold know what needs to exist first?
9. **Instrumentation** — Are success metrics defined with specific events to track? Can you actually measure whether this feature worked?
10. **Migration needs** — If existing behavior changes, is there a migration plan and rollback strategy? Are URL redirects needed?

Iterate with the user until the PRD is solid.

---

## Phase 3: Create GitHub Issue

Once the PRD is finalized, create a GitHub issue to track the feature. A GitHub issue is a to-do item in your project that links back to the PRD so you can track progress, leave comments, and close it when the feature ships.

```bash
gh issue create --title "[Feature] Feature Name" --label "type:feature" --body "..."
```

The issue body should include:
- Link to the PRD file
- Summary of the feature
- Key acceptance criteria (can reference PRD for full list)
- **If this feature belongs to an epic:** Reference the epic issue (e.g., "Part of #XX") so the feature is linked to the bigger picture

---

## Phase 4: Handoff to Planning

The PRD defines *what* to build. The next step is planning *how* to build it — Claude will enter **plan mode** to explore the codebase, design the approach, and break the work into implementation tasks before writing any code.

Tell the user:

> "Your PRD and issue are ready. The next step is planning the implementation. Tell Claude:
>
> *'Plan the implementation for specs/[feature-name]-prd.md (tracked in issue #XX)'*
>
> Claude will enter plan mode — it'll explore your codebase, design the approach, and present an implementation plan for your approval before writing any code."
