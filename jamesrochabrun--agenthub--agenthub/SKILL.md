# AgentHub Task Manager

Use this workflow only because the user explicitly invoked this skill to plan and delegate work to parallel AgentHub agent sessions.

## Plan And Create Task Sessions

1. Read the user's request and infer the independent subtasks yourself. Preserve explicit numbered or bulleted work streams as separate subtasks; do not split ordinary prose just because of punctuation, commas, semicolons, or conjunctions.
2. Call `agent_hub_planning`, passing the original prompt and the subtasks you inferred as `subtasks`. AgentHub does not split for you — with no `subtasks` it plans the whole prompt as a single task.
3. Review the returned assignments and the `harnessCapabilities` block — each harness's **real installed skills and MCP servers**. AgentHub launches a **harness** (Claude Code or Codex), not a model, so present only the harness, never a model name. When multiple harnesses are installed, each subtask comes with a *suggested* harness plus the `matchedCapabilities` that drove it. Confirm or override every suggestion by matching the subtask to the harness whose **actual tools** fit — e.g. a profiling subtask → the harness that has an xctrace/profiler tool; a SwiftUI subtask → the harness with a swiftui skill. Decide from the listed capabilities, never from a harness's general reputation, and cite the matching skill/tool in your rationale.
4. Present the final assignments (task, chosen harness + why, branch, launch prompt) and wait for explicit user approval.
5. Call `agenthub_create_worktree_sessions` only for approved assignments. Pass one task per assignment with explicit `provider`, `branch`, and `prompt`. Include `startPath` when the task belongs to a subdirectory; AgentHub uses nearby project markers to infer a sparse worktree and then launch the agent from that same relative path. Use `sparseProfile` only for extra required paths and `fullCheckout: true` only when the task genuinely needs the whole repository materialized.

For a single-task request, still call `agent_hub_planning` with one subtask so the agent and branch are explicit before approval.

## List Or Delete Task Sessions

Use `agenthub_list_worktrees` before destructive cleanup when the target or session impact is unclear. Use `agenthub_delete_worktree` only after the user identifies the session to delete.

## Boundaries

Do not use these AgentHub task tools for generic planning, fan-out, background work, or subagent requests unless the user explicitly invoked this skill. Preserve the current harness's native subagent and background-task capabilities.
