# Design Brief Generator

## Overview

Generate comprehensive, well-structured design briefs that align stakeholders and guide design projects. This skill helps designers create clear project briefs that define scope, goals, constraints, and success criteria.

**Built for:**
- UX/UI designers
- Product designers
- Design leads
- Design systems teams
- Brand designers

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate Design Brief

Run the interactive script:

```bash
scripts/generate_brief.sh
```

This will guide you through creating a comprehensive design brief covering:
- Project goals and objectives
- Target users and personas
- Design constraints
- Success criteria
- Timeline and deliverables

### 2. Validate Brief

Check brief completeness:

```bash
scripts/validate_brief.sh <brief_file.md>
```

Ensures all critical sections are included.

---

## Core Workflow

### When to Create a Design Brief

**Use a design brief for:**
- New product/feature design projects
- Design system initiatives
- Redesign projects
- Brand identity projects
- UX research initiatives

**Skip for:**
- Minor UI tweaks
- Bug fixes
- Small iterations on existing designs

---

## Design Brief Components

### 1. Project Overview

**What it includes:**
- Project name and description
- Background and context
- Why this project matters now
- Business objectives
- User problems being solved

**Example:**
```markdown
## Project Overview

**Project:** Mobile app redesign
**Background:** Current app has 2.8 star rating with users citing confusing navigation
**Business Goal:** Increase app retention from 15% to 40% (Day 30)
**User Problem:** Users can't find key features, leading to frustration and abandonment
```

---

### 2. Design Goals & Objectives

**Define what success looks like:**
- Primary design goal
- Secondary goals
- Success metrics
- Must-haves vs. nice-to-haves

**Example:**
```markdown
## Design Goals

**Primary Goal:** Create intuitive navigation that helps users complete core tasks in < 3 taps

**Secondary Goals:**
- Reduce visual clutter by 40%
- Improve accessibility (WCAG AA compliance)
- Establish reusable component library

**Success Metrics:**
- Task success rate: 90%+
- Time on task: -50%
- SUS score: 75+
```

---

### 3. Target Users & Personas

**Who are we designing for:**
- Primary user personas
- User needs and pain points
- User goals and motivations
- Technical proficiency
- Context of use

**Example:**
```markdown
## Target Users

**Primary Persona:** Sarah, Marketing Manager
- **Age:** 32-45
- **Tech Savvy:** Medium
- **Goals:** Create campaigns quickly, track performance
- **Pain Points:** Current tool too complex, takes too long
- **Context:** Uses on desktop during work hours, sometimes mobile
```

---

### 4. Design Principles & Direction

**Guiding principles for the project:**
- Core design principles
- Visual direction
- Interaction patterns
- Content strategy
- Accessibility requirements

**Example:**
```markdown
## Design Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Users should never wonder what to do next
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Show what's needed, hide complexity
3. **Consistent patterns** - Use established design system components
4. **Accessible by default** - WCAG AA minimum, aim for AAA
```

---

5. What are the constraints?
6. How will we measure success?
7. Who needs to approve?

### Stakeholder Review Process

**Brief review checklist:**
- [ ] Product Manager reviewed
- [ ] Engineering lead reviewed (feasibility)
- [ ] Design lead approved
- [ ] Key stakeholders aligned
- [ ] Success metrics agreed upon
- [ ] Timeline confirmed
- [ ] Resources allocated

---

## Design Brief Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ **Start with "why"** - Clearly state the problem
- ✅ **Define success** - Specific, measurable criteria
- ✅ **Include constraints** - Technical, time, resource
- ✅ **Show examples** - Inspiration, references
- ✅ **Get buy-in early** - Review draft with stakeholders
- ✅ **Keep it concise** - 2-3 pages maximum
- ✅ **Make it visual** - Include diagrams, mockups, references

### DON'T:
- ❌ **Jump to solutions** - Focus on problem first
- ❌ **Be vague** - "Make it better" isn't helpful
- ❌ **Ignore constraints** - They shape the solution
- ❌ **Work in isolation** - Involve PM, Engineering early
- ❌ **Skip research** - Base decisions on data
- ❌ **Forget accessibility** - Consider from the start

## Tips for Designers

### Before Creating the Brief

1. **Talk to stakeholders** - Understand the real problem
2. **Review existing research** - Don't start from scratch
3. **Check technical constraints** - Talk to engineering
4. **Understand the timeline** - Be realistic

### During Brief Creation

1. **Start with template** - Don't reinvent the wheel
2. **Be specific** - Vague briefs lead to vague designs
3. **Include visuals** - Mood boards, references, examples
4. **Define success** - How will you know it worked?

### After Brief Creation

1. **Review with PM** - Align on goals and scope
2. **Review with Engineering** - Validate feasibility
3. **Get stakeholder sign-off** - Explicit approval
4. **Treat it as living doc** - Update as you learn

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Too Broad

**Problem:** "Redesign the entire app"
**Solution:** Break into phases, prioritize

### Pitfall 2: Solution-First

**Problem:** "Make it look like Apple"
**Solution:** Start with user problems, not aesthetics

### Pitfall 3: No Constraints

**Problem:** Ignoring technical/time limits
**Solution:** Document and respect constraints

### Pitfall 4: Skipping Research

**Problem:** Designing based on assumptions
**Solution:** At minimum, review existing data

### Pitfall 5: Vague Success Criteria

**Problem:** "Make it better" isn't measurable
**Solution:** Define specific, testable criteria

---

## Summary

A great design brief:

1. **Defines the problem** clearly
2. **Sets goals** and success criteria
3. **Identifies users** and their needs
4. **Documents constraints** (time, tech, budget)
5. **Aligns stakeholders** early
6. **Guides the work** without being prescriptive
7. **Evolves** as you learn

**Get started:**
```bash
scripts/generate_brief.sh
```

This creates a solid foundation for successful design projects.
