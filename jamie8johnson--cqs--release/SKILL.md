# Release

Release a new version of cqs.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — version bump type: `major`, `minor`, or `patch` (default: `patch`)

## Process

1. **Pre-flight checks**:
   - `git status` — must be clean (no uncommitted changes)
   - `gh pr list --state open` — review any open PRs. Merge or close before releasing.
   - `cargo test` — all tests must pass
   - `cargo clippy` — no warnings
   - Confirm on `main` branch

2. **Version bump**:
   - Read current version from `Cargo.toml`
   - Calculate new version based on bump type
   - Update `Cargo.toml` version field
   - Run `cargo check` to update `Cargo.lock`

3. **Docs review**:
   Run `/docs-review`. Fix anything stale before cutting the release.

4. **Changelog**:
   - Read `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Add new section with version and date
   - Summarize changes since last release using `git log` since last tag
   - Categorize: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed

5. **Commit and tag**:
   - Create branch: `release/vX.Y.Z`
   - Commit: `chore: Release vX.Y.Z`
   - Create PR via PowerShell (WSL): `powershell.exe -Command 'gh pr create ...'`
   - Use `--body-file` for PR body (never inline heredocs)
   - Wait for CI: `powershell.exe -Command 'gh pr checks N --watch'`

6. **After PR merge**:
   - Sync main: `git checkout main && git pull`
   - Tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z`
   - Push tag via PowerShell: `powershell.exe -Command 'cd C:\Projects\cqs; git push origin vX.Y.Z'`
   - GitHub Release with pre-built binaries is created automatically by `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - Publish to crates.io: `cargo publish`

7. **Post-release**:
   - Update PROJECT_CONTINUITY.md with new version
   - Update ROADMAP.md if phase milestones changed

## WSL notes

- All `git push` and `gh` commands go through PowerShell (Windows has credentials)
- Always use `--body-file` for PR/release bodies — never inline heredocs
- Write body content to `/mnt/c/Projects/cqs/pr_body.md`, use it, then delete
