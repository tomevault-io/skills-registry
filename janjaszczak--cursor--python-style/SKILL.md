description: Enforce consistent Python typing (type hints + return types), concise Google-style docstrings, PEP 8/Black formatting, and unit tests when creating or editing Python code. Use when working on .py files, Python APIs, refactors, or bug fixes where maintainability and correctness matter. Use when this capability is needed.

# Python Style & Quality Gate (Typing • Docstrings • PEP 8/Black • Tests)

## Purpose
When writing or modifying Python, apply a “quality gate” aligned to this rule-set:
- Use type hints consistently (including return types), prefer `from __future__ import annotations`.
- Write concise docstrings for public modules/classes/functions (one-line summary + key params/returns/raises) in Google style.
- Follow PEP 8; Black formatting; keep functions small and cohesive.
- Provide unit tests that exercise the documented behavior and typed signatures.

## When to activate
Activate this skill when:
- Editing/creating `**/*.py`, or
- The user requests: typing, annotations, docstrings, PEP 8, Black, refactor-for-clarity, unit tests, pytest.

## Guardrails
- Minimize blast radius: do NOT reformat or refactor unrelated files unless the user asks.
- Preserve runtime behavior unless explicitly asked to change it.
- Prefer repo conventions over personal preference:
  - If the repo already uses ruff/mypy/pytest/unittest/isort/black settings, follow those.
  - If no tooling is present, default to Black-compatible formatting and pytest-style tests.

## Workflow (agent-operational)
1) **Clarify (0–3 questions max)** only if needed:
   - Target Python version? (or infer from `pyproject.toml`, `tox.ini`, CI)
   - Test framework in use (pytest vs unittest)?
   - Any strict typing expectations (mypy strict, pyright, etc.)?

2) **Dynamic context discovery**
   - Locate and follow existing style/tooling:
     - `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini`, `.ruff.toml`, `mypy.ini`, CI config.
   - Find canonical patterns in-code (similar modules, existing docstring style, existing test structure).

3) **Plan before large edits**
   - For multi-file refactors or public API changes, write a short plan with:
     - Files to touch
     - Small incremental steps
     - Verification steps (commands to run)

4) **Implement (incremental)**
   - Add/fix annotations for all params and return types.
     - Avoid `Any` unless truly unavoidable; if used, explain why and consider narrower types.
     - Prefer precise unions, protocols, generics, and typed collections.
   - Add `from __future__ import annotations` in new modules; in existing modules, follow repo pattern.
   - Ensure functions are small and cohesive; if a function is multi-purpose, propose (or perform) a small refactor into smaller units.

5) **Docstrings (public surfaces)**
   - Public module/class/function docstrings should be concise:
     - One-line summary (imperative mood)
     - Google style sections as needed:
       - Args / Returns / Raises
   - Keep docstrings aligned with real behavior and current signature.

6) **Tests**
   - Add or update unit tests to cover:
     - Core behavior
     - Edge cases implied by types/docs
     - Error paths (especially documented `Raises`)
   - Prefer targeted tests (fast, deterministic). Mirror existing repo testing patterns.

7) **Verification**
   - Run the most relevant checks available in the repo (in this order if present):
     - Formatter/linter (black/ruff)
     - Type checker (mypy/pyright)
     - Unit tests (pytest/unittest)
   - If tools are missing, state what you *would* run and why.

## Output expectations (what “done” looks like)
- All touched Python functions have explicit param + return annotations.
- Public API surfaces have up-to-date concise Google-style docstrings.
- Formatting is Black/PEP8-consistent (or consistent with repo tooling).
- Tests exist/updated and meaningfully cover the changed behavior.

## Common edge cases
- Legacy codebases without typing:
  - Add types incrementally; prioritize touched surfaces and high-value boundaries.
- Dynamic/duck-typed areas:
  - Prefer `Protocol`, `TypedDict`, `Mapping[str, Any]` (as last resort), or narrow `Any` usage with justification.
- Performance-sensitive paths:
  - Avoid heavy runtime validation; keep typing mostly static.

## Examples

### Example: function update
**Input request:** “Add a helper to parse an ISO date string and update callers.”

**Expected actions:**
- Create `parse_iso_date(value: str) -> datetime.date`
- Add docstring documenting accepted formats and raises
- Add tests for valid date, invalid date, boundary cases
- Update callers with correct types

### Example: refactor prompt
If a function violates cohesion (multiple responsibilities), propose:
- Extract 1–3 smaller helpers with tight types
- Keep behavior identical
- Add tests around the original public entrypoint
