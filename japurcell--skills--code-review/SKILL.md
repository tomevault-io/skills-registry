# Code Review

Review only the requested change scope. Anchor every finding to that change. Prefer behavior-preserving simplification: smaller, clearer, more direct code over cleverness or incidental complexity.

## When to use

- Review a pull request before merge
- Review a branch, work-in-progress changes, staged or unstaged changes, recent commits, or AI-generated code
- Review since a fixed point such as a commit, branch, tag, `main`, or `HEAD~N`
- Compare changes against repo standards or a spec / issue / PRD
- Request a thermo-nuclear / thermonuclear / deep code quality / especially harsh maintainability review
- Produce machine-readable findings for another model or script

## Scope

Review for:

- correctness
- readability
- architecture
- security
- performance
- standards adherence
- spec adherence, if a spec exists
- maintainability

Report only issues introduced by, exposed by, or clearly reachable through the reviewed change.

## Required-agent rule

If this skill requires a dedicated agent, run it. Do not merge, combine, substitute, skip, or manually emulate required agents.

## Process

1. Invoke `subagent-model-router` and `addy-code-review-and-quality`.
2. Make a todo list.
3. Set the review target only; do not read PR or issue content directly in this step.
   - PR review: target the PR.
   - Fixed-point review: use exactly the user-provided target.
   - If the user says "review since X" but X is not a fixed point, ask: `Review against what — a branch, a commit, or main?` Stop until answered.
4. Main-agent GitHub intake rule:
   - The main agent must not read PR or GitHub issue content directly.
   - All GitHub PR/issue intake must be done by a fast-tier subagent using `gh`, not web fetch.
   - The main agent may use only the subagent summary unless a later required agent needs more detail.
5. Capture inputs via fast-tier subagents:
   - Fixed-point reviews:
     - `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD`
     - `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`
   - PR reviews: fetch and summarize:
     - PR status and early-stop recommendation: open / closed / draft / review not needed / already reviewed by you
     - title, body summary, branch info, changed files, linked issues, referenced specs, notable metadata
     - compact summary of linked or referenced GitHub issues relevant to scope or spec
     - likely spec-source candidates in priority order
   - If not reviewing a PR but GitHub issues are referenced, fetch and summarize them.
6. Stop early if intake says a PR is closed, draft, does not need review, or already has a review from you.
7. Gather only relevant standards/context files via a fast-tier subagent, checking repo root and touched paths as applicable:
   - `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, `STYLE.md`, `STANDARDS.md`, `STYLEGUIDE.md`, `docs/adr/*`, `.editorconfig`, `eslint.config.*`, `biome.json`, `prettier.config.*`, `tsconfig.json`
8. Identify the spec source in this order:
   1. issue references from commit messages or PR metadata
   2. user-supplied path
   3. matching spec / PRD under `docs/`, `specs/`, `.scratch/`, or `.agents/scratchpad/**`
   4. if none is found, ask where the spec is; if there is no spec, record `no spec available` and skip the Spec agent
9. Preflight required agents. Hard stop if any required agent is missing.
   - Always required:
     - `addy-code-reviewer`
     - `addy-security-auditor`
     - `addy-test-engineer`
     - Maintainability agent
     - Standards agent
   - Required only if a spec exists:
     - Spec agent
   - Required only for PR reviews:
     - History agent
     - Related-PR agent
     - Code-comment agent
10. Spawn required agents in parallel.

- PR-only:
  - History agent: use `git blame` and modified-code history to identify historically supported issues.
  - Related-PR agent: review prior PRs touching the same files for comments that still apply.
  - Code-comment agent: check whether the change violates guidance in comments within modified files.
- All reviews:
  - `addy-code-reviewer`: correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance
  - `addy-security-auditor`: OWASP Top 10, secrets, auth/authz, threat model, dependency CVEs
  - `addy-test-engineer`: test gaps in happy path, edge cases, error paths, concurrency
  - Spec agent if a spec exists: missing or partial requirements, scope creep, incorrect implementation
  - Maintainability agent: do a strict maintainability review. Prefer deleting complexity over rearranging it. Aggressively flag:
    - file growth from under 1000 lines to over 1000 without strong justification
    - new ad-hoc conditionals, spaghetti growth, one-off booleans, nullable modes, or flags that complicate control flow
    - unnecessary wrappers, casts, optionality, indirection, `any`, `unknown`, ad-hoc object shapes, or cast-heavy contracts that obscure invariants
    - hacky or magical behavior, generic mechanisms hiding simple data-shape assumptions
    - logic in the wrong layer, duplication of canonical helpers, copy-pasted logic instead of extracted helpers
    - narrow edge-case handling inserted into an already busy function
    - sequential orchestration or non-atomic updates when a cleaner structure is obvious
    - Treat unjustified file-size explosions, spaghetti growth, unnecessary abstraction layers, wrong-layer logic, and obvious duplication of canonical helpers as presumptive blockers unless clearly justified. Prefer a small number of high-conviction structural findings over cosmetic notes.
  - Standards agent: report only documented standards violations; cite file and rule; skip anything tooling enforces.

11. Filter false positives.

- For each issue, spawn a parallel fast-tier subagent to score whether it is real or a false positive using the issue, reviewed change, and relevant standards files.
- Use this rubric verbatim:
  - 0: Not confident at all. This is a false positive that doesn't stand up to light scrutiny.
  - 25: Somewhat confident. This might be a real issue, but may also be a false positive. The agent wasn't able to verify that it's a real issue. If the issue is stylistic, it is one that was not explicitly called out in the relevant standards file.
  - 50: Moderately confident. The agent verified this is real, but it may be minor or uncommon.
  - 75: Highly confident. The agent verified it is very likely real and important, will be hit in practice, or is directly mentioned in the relevant standards file.
  - 100: Absolutely certain. The agent confirmed it is definitely real and will happen frequently in practice; the evidence directly confirms this.
- For standards findings, confirm the standards file explicitly supports the finding.
- Filter out issues with score below 75.

## Exclusions

- Do not report speculative bugs that do not survive light scrutiny.
- Do not report pedantic nitpicks.
- Do not report issues tooling should catch.
- Do not make generic requests for more tests, docs, or security review unless explicitly required by a standards file or clearly broken in the change.
- Do not report likely intentional functional changes tied to the broader change.
- Do not report issues on unchanged lines unless the change clearly exposes or activates them.
- Do not run builds, typechecks, linters, or benchmarks unless the user explicitly asks.

## Primary review questions

- Is there a code-judo move that would make this dramatically simpler?
- Did the diff add branching complexity where a better abstraction should exist?
- Is this logic in the right file and layer?
- Is this abstraction earning its keep, or is it just a wrapper?
- Did the diff introduce casts, optionality, or ad-hoc object shapes that obscure the real invariant?

## Output modes

### A. PR comment mode

If reviewing a PR, repeat the PR eligibility check before commenting. If still eligible, post with `gh pr comment`.

If qualifying findings remain, use this format exactly:

```text
### Code review
Found <N> issues:
1. <brief description>
   <link to file and line with full sha and line range>
2. <brief description>
   <link to file and line with full sha and line range>
3. <brief description>
   <link to file and line with full sha and line range>
   <sub>- If this code review was useful, please react with 👍. Otherwise, react with 👎.</sub>
...
```

If no qualifying findings remain, use:

```text
### Code review
## No issues found. Checked for bugs, standards compliance, and maintainability.
```

PR comment requirements:

- keep it brief
- no emojis except the required footer line
- cite and link relevant files, code, standards, and URLs
- for code links, use full Git SHA and line ranges
- provide at least 1 line of context before and after when possible

Link format must be exactly:
`https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/blob/FULL_SHA/path/to/file.ext#L10-L15`

Requirements:

- full git sha only
- repository name must match the reviewed repo
- line format `#L[start]-L[end]`

### B. Machine-readable mode

Categorize findings as Critical, Important, or Suggestion. Output a structured review with specific file:line references and fix recommendations.

## Review priorities

1. correctness bugs
2. documented repo standards violations
3. spec mismatches
4. structural maintainability regressions
5. missed opportunities for dramatic simplification when a clear path is visible
6. architecture boundary problems
7. security and performance issues supported by the change
8. readability issues that materially affect comprehension

## Tone

Be direct, serious, and brief. Do not be rude. Do not soften major maintainability or correctness problems into mild suggestions. Do not treat a change as no-issue merely because behavior seems correct if it clearly makes the codebase structurally worse.

## Final checks

Before returning or commenting, verify:

- [ ] every required dedicated agent for this review type was run
- [ ] no required agent was merged, combined, substituted, skipped, or manually emulated
- [ ] every finding is tied to the reviewed change
- [ ] every finding has a concrete file reference
- [ ] every standards-based finding is explicitly supported by a standards file
- [ ] no excluded false positives are included
- [ ] if a plausible restructuring would delete substantial incidental complexity, call it out
- [ ] if a major maintainability problem is present, do not hide it behind minor wording
- [ ] output matches the requested mode exactly
