# Google Account Setup

Interactive workflow to set up a Gmail account for sync and triage.

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains executable wrappers for all API endpoints. **Always use these scripts** instead of raw curl commands.

Run scripts using their full path relative to this skill's base directory (provided when the skill is loaded). For example: `<skill-base-dir>/scripts/get-account 1`

All scripts default to `http://localhost:2529`. Override with `CLAUDE_ASSIST_SERVER` env var.

Available scripts: `create-account`, `get-account`, `update-account`, `add-alias`, `sync-emails`

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Account Details

Ask the user:

- **Identifier**: Short name like "work" or "personal"
- **Email**: Their Gmail address
- **Display name**: Their full name (optional)

### 2. Confirm Test User Setup

Before generating the OAuth URL, ask the user:

> "If this email is not part of your Google Cloud organization, please confirm you've added it as a test user at <https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience> (the app must also be set to 'External' rather than 'Internal'). Have you done this?"

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

### 3. Create Account

```bash
scripts/create-account --identifier "<identifier>" --email "<email>" --display-name "<name>"
```

Response includes `authUrl` - present this to the user.

### 4. OAuth Authorization

Tell the user to open the `authUrl` in their browser and complete Google authorization. Wait for them to confirm completion.

### 5. Verify Credentials

```bash
scripts/get-account <id>
```

Confirm `has_credentials: true`. If false, offer to generate a new auth URL via `POST /google/accounts/<id>/reauth`.

### 6. Configure Settings

Ask the user:

- **email_sync_start_date**: "From what date should I sync emails? (YYYY-MM-DD format, or leave blank to sync all)"
- **email_label_prefix**: "What prefix for Gmail labels? (default: AI)"

Apply settings:

```bash
scripts/update-account <id> --sync-start-date "<date>" --label-prefix "<prefix>"
```

#### Triage System Instructions

The `email_triage_instructions` field lets you customize the AI triage behavior with account-specific rules. This plain text gets injected directly into Haiku's system prompt during email analysis.

**When to use:**

- **Name disambiguation**: When names in emails could be confused with the account owner
- **Custom extraction rules**: Account-specific patterns for commitments, action items, etc.
- **Context about roles/relationships**: Help the AI understand the user's work context

**Example - Name disambiguation:**

```bash
scripts/update-account <id> --triage-instructions "NAME DISAMBIGUATION:
- \"Christopher\" in emails refers to teammate Christopher Yamas, NOT the account owner
- The account owner goes by \"Chris\" or \"Chris Alfano\" only"
```

**Developing triage instructions:**

1. Start with common confusion points (similar names, nicknames)
2. Add context about the user's role and typical email interactions
3. Include any domain-specific terminology or patterns
4. Test by running triage on sample emails and reviewing results
5. Iterate based on extraction accuracy

### 7. Add Name Aliases

Ask the user what names refer to them (for commitment extraction). Only add names the user actually uses - don't assume variations.

**Important**: Names that refer to other people (teammates, etc.) should NOT be added as aliases. Instead, document these in `email_triage_instructions` for disambiguation.

For each alias:

```bash
scripts/add-alias <id> --alias "<name>"
```

### 8. Complete

Summarize the configured account and ask: "Would you like me to trigger an initial sync now?"

If yes, trigger a full sync:

```bash
scripts/sync-emails --account "<identifier>" --full
```

This will fetch untriaged inbox emails and queue them for triage.
