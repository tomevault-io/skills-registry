# Publish Code

Guide a repository from private to public. Adapts to user intent - from "just make it public" to "want contributors."

## Requirements

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) | Secrets detection (scans git history) | `brew install gitleaks` |
| [typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos) | Spell checking for code | `brew install typos-cli` |
| [lychee](https://lychee.cli.rs/) | Link checking | `brew install lychee` |
| [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) | Markdown formatting (autofix) | `brew install markdownlint-cli` |
| [gh](https://cli.github.com/) | GitHub CLI | `brew install gh` |

## Workflow

```
1. QUICK SCAN     (2-3s) → Gather context
2. SMART QUESTION        → What's your goal?
3. TARGETED WORK         → Based on intent
4. PUBLISH               → Make public, optional announcements
```

## Phase 1: Quick Scan

Run these checks synchronously (~2-3 seconds total):

```bash
# Git state - dirty?
git status --porcelain | head -5

# Remote exists?
git remote -v

# Already public? What is it?
gh repo view --json visibility,description,url 2>/dev/null || echo "No GitHub remote"

# What files exist?
ls -la LICENSE* README* CONTRIBUTING* 2>/dev/null
ls pyproject.toml package.json Cargo.toml go.mod 2>/dev/null
```

**Parse results into context:**

- `is_dirty`: Has uncommitted changes?
- `has_remote`: Connected to GitHub?
- `is_public`: Already visible to world?
- `has_license`: LICENSE file exists?
- `has_readme`: README exists?
- `language`: Python/Node/Rust/Go/other
- `description`: One-line summary from GitHub or README first line

## Phase 2: Smart Question

Use AskUserQuestion with context baked into the question:

**Example (adapt based on scan results):**

> "This is a Python CLI tool, currently private, has README but no license.
> What's your goal?"

Options:

1. **Just make it public** - Minimal: add license, quick sanity check, flip visibility
2. **Make it usable by others** - Standard: license, README polish, install docs, portability check
3. **Want community/contributors** - Full: above + CONTRIBUTING.md, issue templates, CI

**Adapt the question:**

- If already public: "Already public. Want to improve discoverability?"
- If dirty state: "You have uncommitted changes. Commit first, or proceed anyway?"
- If no remote: "No GitHub remote. Want to create one?"

## Phase 3: Targeted Work

### Path A: Minimal ("just make it public")

**1. Add LICENSE if missing**

Ask which license:

- **MIT** - Simple, permissive. Best for utilities/libraries.
- **Apache-2.0** - Adds patent protection. Better for applications.

Fetch from GitHub API, substitute placeholders using git config:

```bash
# Get author name from git config
AUTHOR=$(git config user.name)

# MIT license
gh api /licenses/mit --jq '.body' | sed "s/\[year\]/$(date +%Y)/g" | sed "s/\[fullname\]/$AUTHOR/g" > LICENSE

# Apache-2.0 (no placeholders in template)
gh api /licenses/apache-2.0 --jq '.body' > LICENSE
```

**Verify the LICENSE file:**

- Check it exists and has content: `wc -l LICENSE` (should be 20+ lines)
- For MIT: `grep '\[year\]\|\[fullname\]' LICENSE || true` (no output = placeholders substituted)
- Quick sanity check: `head -3 LICENSE` (should show license name and copyright)

**2. Quick sanity check**

Read README and any config files. Look for:

- Hardcoded user paths (`/Users/xxx/`, `/home/xxx/`)
- Organization-specific references that should be generalized
- API keys or secrets (STOP if found)
- Hardcoded service IDs (Notion, Discord, Slack, etc.)

This is Claude reading files, not mechanical grep. Use judgment.

**3. Make public**

```bash
gh repo edit --visibility public --accept-visibility-change-consequences
```

**Verify it worked:**

```bash
gh repo view --json visibility,url --jq '"Visibility: \(.visibility), URL: \(.url)"'
```

Confirm output shows `PUBLIC` before proceeding. Done for minimal path.

---

### Path B: Standard ("usable by others")

Everything in Minimal, plus:

**1. README quality check**

Read full README. Verify it has:

- [ ] One-line description at top
- [ ] Installation instructions (with actual commands)
- [ ] Usage example (working code or CLI invocation)
- [ ] License mention

**Also check for implicit dependencies** - list ALL tools needed, including "obvious" ones:

- curl, jq, grep - not installed everywhere
- Language runtimes (python3, node)
- Package managers (brew, apt)

If missing sections, offer to add them. Keep it concise.

**2. Portability audit**

Run the audit script (in the same directory as this SKILL.md):

```bash
./audit.py [repo-path]
```

The script uses external tools (exit codes: 0=clean, 1+=issues found - this is expected):

- **Secrets**: gitleaks - scans git history for leaked credentials
- **Typos**: typos - spell checking for code and documentation
- **Broken links**: lychee - fast async link checker
- **Markdown**: markdownlint --fix - autofixes formatting, reports unfixable
- **Hardcoded paths**: `/Users/xxx/`, `/home/xxx/`, `C:\Users\xxx\`
- **Personal refs**: Scans for git user.name/user.email in tracked files

**Limits**: Scans first 300 tracked files, skips files >200KB. Large repos may have unscanned files.

**JSON output schema:**

```json
{
  "repo_path": "/path/to/repo",
  "repo_name": "repo",
  "files_checked": 42,
  "basics": {
    "has_license": true,
    "has_readme": true,
    "has_contributing": false,
    "has_gitignore": true
  },
  "has_blockers": true,       // secrets found - STOP
  "needs_review": true,       // non-blocking issues found
  "secrets": [...],           // HIGH severity
  "typos": [...],
  "broken_links": [...],
  "markdown_unfixable": [...],
  "hardcoded_paths": [...],
  "personal_refs": [...]      // username/email found in files
}
```

Review output for:

- `has_blockers: true`: STOP - secrets found, address immediately
- `hardcoded_paths`: Fix or document
- `broken_links`: Update or remove
- `typos`: Review suggestions and fix
- `markdown_unfixable`: Manual fixes needed
- `personal_refs`: Review if expected (LICENSE ok, README probably not)

**3. Check tracked files that should be gitignored**

Run `git ls-files` and flag files that typically shouldn't be tracked:

- `*.local.*` (personal settings)
- `.env*` (even empty templates can be risky)
- `*_cache/`, `__pycache__/`, `node_modules/`
- `*.log`, `*.bak`, `*.tmp`
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`

If found, untrack with `git rm --cached` and add to `.gitignore`.

**4. README quality review**

Check README.md manually for:

- **Length**: If >300 lines, suggest splitting into docs/
- **Structure**: Should have Install, Usage, License sections at minimum
- **Examples**: Should be generic, not personal projects/data
- **Links**: Verify they're useful for external users

**5. Claude review of key files**

Read these files and flag anything that assumes personal/org context:

- README.md (intro and examples)
- Config files (config.toml, settings.py, etc.)
- Example files

Look for:

- Personal examples that should be generic (names, interests, projects)
- Organization-specific terminology or internal jargon
- Hardcoded service IDs (Notion, Discord, Slack, etc.)
- Location-specific content (flag - might be intentional)

**6. GitHub topics**

If no topics set, suggest relevant ones:

```bash
gh repo edit --add-topic python --add-topic cli-tool
```

**7. Make public + optional announcement**

Make public, then offer to draft a tweet:

```
🚀 Just open-sourced [name]!

[One-line description]

GitHub: [url]
```

Keep it simple. User can embellish.

---

### Path C: Full ("want contributors")

Everything in Standard, plus:

**1. CONTRIBUTING.md**

Create if missing:

```markdown
# Contributing

## Setup

[Clone and install instructions]

## Development

[How to run tests, lint, etc.]

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch
3. Make changes
4. Submit PR
```

Keep it short. Long CONTRIBUTING.md files go unread.

**2. Issue templates**

Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`:

```markdown
---
name: Bug Report
about: Report a bug
labels: bug
---

**What happened?**

**Steps to reproduce**

**Expected behavior**

**Environment**
- OS:
- Version:
```

Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`:

```markdown
---
name: Feature Request
about: Suggest an idea
labels: enhancement
---

**Problem**

**Proposed solution**
```

**3. Announcements**

Offer to draft for multiple platforms:

**Hacker News (Show HN):**

```
Show HN: [Name] – [description]

[2-3 sentences: what it does, why it exists]

GitHub: [url]

Looking for feedback on [specific aspect].
```

**Reddit:**

```
[Name] - [description] [open source]

Just open-sourced this tool that [solves X].

Quick start: [install command]

GitHub: [url]
```

Present drafts for user approval. Never post without explicit confirmation.

---

## Important Rules

- **NEVER make public without explicit user confirmation**
- **NEVER post announcements without user approval**
- **STOP immediately if real secrets found** (API keys, tokens)
- **Ask, don't assume** - if unsure whether something is personal/sensitive, ask
- **80/20** - Don't over-polish. Ship it.

## Quick Reference

**License cheat sheet:**

| License | Best for |
|---------|----------|
| MIT | Libraries, utilities, quick tools |
| Apache-2.0 | Applications, anything with patent concerns |

**Announcement priority (for dev tools):**

1. Twitter/X (quick, low friction)
2. Hacker News (high impact if it lands)
3. Reddit (targeted subreddits)
