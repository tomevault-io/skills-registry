# AWS Well-Architected Framework

## Purpose

This skill encodes the AWS Well-Architected Framework's six pillars as heuristics and checklists for planning and reviewing AWS interactions. Use it to ensure architectural decisions align with AWS best practices.

## When to Use

- Planning new AWS resources or architectures
- Reviewing existing infrastructure
- Validating proposed changes
- Assessing compliance with best practices
- Identifying improvement opportunities

## When NOT to Use

- Emergency fixes (address immediate issue, then review)
- Cost-only analysis (use `aws-cost-optimizer` for detailed cost work)
- Compliance-only validation (use `aws-governance-guardrails`)

---

## The Six Pillars

| Pillar | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Operational Excellence | Operations, automation, improvement |
| Security | Protection, detection, response |
| Reliability | Recovery, resilience, availability |
| Performance Efficiency | Right resources, optimization |

## Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA)

### Concept

MVA defines what the Well-Architected Framework says you **should** have for a service at a given environment tier. It sits above MNA (Minimum Needed Architecture), which is what's technically required for a service to function at all.

| Term | Definition | Example (CloudFront) |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| **MNA** | What's technically required to function | An origin and a domain |
| **MVA** | What Well-Architected says you should have | Access logging, TLS 1.2+, custom error pages, WAF integration, OAC for S3 |

**The gap between MNA and MVA is where informed decisions live.** For a test deployment, the user might accept the gap. For production, they should not.

### MVA Baseline Structure

MVA baselines are defined per service in `mva-baselines/{service}.md`. Each file contains environment tiers as sections, with production as the superset:

```
mva-baselines/
├── _TEMPLATE.md        # Reference template for adding new services
├── cloudfront.md       # CloudFront MVA baseline
├── ec2.md              # EC2 MVA baseline
└── s3.md               # S3 MVA baseline
```

Each baseline file follows this structure:
- **Common (All Environments)** — Items required regardless of tier
- **Sandbox** — Additional items (typically none)
- **Development** — Additional items beyond Common
- **Staging** — Additional items beyond Development (enforcement-gated)
- **Production** — Additional items beyond Staging (ALL mandatory)
- **Gap Detection Guide** — How to check, what constitutes a gap, severity, remediation

### MVA Extensibility

MVA baselines follow a layered model. Higher layers can ADD requirements but CANNOT lower core safety:

```
Core MVA (per service)        ← Defined here in skills/aws/aws-well-architected/mva-baselines/
        ↓
Org MVA extensions            ← Defined in skills/org/aws-mva-extensions/ (can ADD items)
        ↓
BU MVA extensions             ← Defined in skills/bu/{bu}/mva-extensions/ (can ADD further)
```

Only the user can accept gaps below core MVA, and only for non-production environments.

---

## Service Appropriateness Check

Before evaluating MVA compliance, the orchestrator MUST evaluate whether the **service choice itself** is appropriate for the use case. This catches architectural failures that per-service MVA cannot detect.

### Why This Matters

A perfectly configured EC2 instance is still the wrong architecture for hosting a static HTML file. The original WAR gave a pass for Cost Optimization on EC2 hosting a static game because it only evaluated the *configuration* of the chosen service, not whether the *choice of service* was appropriate.

### How to Evaluate

Ask: **"Given what the user wants to achieve, is this the right AWS service?"**

| User Goal | Wrong Service | Right Service | Why |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| Host static HTML/CSS/JS | EC2 | S3 + CloudFront | No compute needed; CDN is cheaper, faster, more reliable |
| Run a scheduled script once/day | EC2 (24/7) | Lambda + EventBridge | Pay-per-execution vs always-on |
| Simple key-value store | RDS | DynamoDB | Relational DB overhead for non-relational data |
| Host a container with no scaling | ECS + ALB | App Runner | Managed container runtime, no ALB needed |
| Deploy an AI agent with session state | EC2 / ECS | Bedrock AgentCore | Purpose-built: session isolation, identity, tool gateway, up to 8-hour sessions |
| Simple API proxy to Bedrock | AgentCore | API Gateway + Bedrock | AgentCore overhead unnecessary for stateless pass-through |
| Batch inference (no agent loop) | AgentCore | Bedrock Batch Inference | Batch is cheaper and simpler for non-interactive workloads |

### Severity

Service inappropriateness is always **High** severity for the **Cost Optimization** pillar. It may also affect **Performance Efficiency** and **Operational Excellence**.

### Output Format

```markdown
### Service Appropriateness
- Use case: {what the user wants to achieve}
- Proposed service: {service}
- Assessment: {APPROPRIATE / INAPPROPRIATE}
- If inappropriate: Recommended alternative: {service} — {reason}
```

## WAR Evaluation Instructions (For Orchestrator)

**IMPORTANT:** WAR evaluation is performed by the **primary orchestrator (Opus) inline during planning** — NOT delegated to a sub-agent. The orchestrator already has the user's request, discovery results, and skill context. WAR assessment is a reasoning task that belongs at the orchestration layer.

### Evaluation Procedure

When evaluating a proposed change or deployment, follow these steps in order:

1. **Identify service(s)** being deployed or modified
2. **Check service appropriateness** — Is this the right service for the use case? (see above)
3. **Identify environment tier** from the target profile/account classification
4. **Read enforcement level** from `config/environments/environments.yaml` → `well_architected.enforcement`
5. **Load MVA baseline** from `skills/aws/aws-well-architected/mva-baselines/{service}.md`
6. **Load org/BU extensions** if they exist in `skills/org/aws-mva-extensions/` or `skills/bu/`
7. **Compare proposed architecture** against each MVA item for the target environment tier
8. **Generate findings** using the WAR Findings Format below
9. **Apply execution gate** based on enforcement level

### Enforcement Levels

| Level | Behavior | Blocking threshold | What's flexible |
|-------|----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| `optional` | Informational only | Nothing blocked | All gaps acceptable |
| `warn` | Present and acknowledge | Nothing blocked | All gaps (with warning) |
| `strict` | Block on critical/high/medium | Critical, High, and Medium **block execution** | Low only |
| `enforce` | Block on all gaps | All severities **block execution** | Nothing — no override path |

### What NOT to Do

- **DO NOT** skip WAR evaluation for any deployment
- **DO NOT** self-certify with green checkmarks — evaluate against actual MVA baselines
- **DO NOT** allow the planner to generate its own WAR assessment — the orchestrator evaluates
- **DO NOT** proceed past a block without the user modifying the proposed architecture
- **DO NOT** gate sandbox/test deployments — optional/warn enforcement means inform, never block
- **DO NOT** defer WAR to execution time — assess during planning, before plan is finalized

---

## WAR Findings Format

All WAR assessments MUST use this structured format. Emoji-only assessments without detail are prohibited.

```markdown
## Well-Architected Assessment

### Summary
- Service(s): {list of services being deployed/modified}
- Environment: {tier}
- Enforcement: {level from environments.yaml}
- Overall: COMPLIANT | GAPS_NOTED | CRITICAL_GAPS

### Service Appropriateness
- Use case: {what the user wants to achieve}
- Proposed service: {service}
- Assessment: APPROPRIATE | INAPPROPRIATE
- If inappropriate: Recommended alternative: {service} — {reason}

### MVA Baseline Comparison

Use the status set that matches the WAR context (see MVA Status Definitions below).

**For plans (new or modified infrastructure):**

| Pillar | MVA Item | Status | Detail | Severity | Remediation |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Security | Access logging enabled | REMEDIATE / ACCEPTABLE / BLOCKED | {what the plan does or why it's acceptable/blocked} | Critical/High/Medium/Low | {how the plan fixes it, or how user could fix it} |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**For reviews (existing infrastructure):**

| Pillar | MVA Item | Status | Detail | Severity | Remediation |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Security | Access logging enabled | PASS / FAIL | {current state} | Critical/High/Medium/Low | {how to fix if FAIL} |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### User Overrides (Plans Only)
After presenting the plan, the user can adjust dispositions:
- **REMEDIATE → skip**: "Don't bother with {item}" — becomes ACCEPTABLE if enforcement allows, stays BLOCKED if enforcement requires it
- **ACCEPTABLE → add**: "Add {item} to the plan" — becomes REMEDIATE
- **BLOCKED → cannot downgrade**: To change enforcement rules, modify `config/environments/environments.yaml` (tracked git change)

### Execution Gate
- Gate: PROCEED | WARN_AND_PROCEED | BLOCKED
- If BLOCKED: The following items must be resolved before execution:
  1. {item + required remediation}
  2. ...
- If WARN_AND_PROCEED: The following ACCEPTABLE gaps were noted:
  1. {item + why acceptable at this tier}
  2. ...
```

### MVA Status Definitions

WAR uses two different status sets depending on context. Planning and reviewing are fundamentally different operations — planning assesses what *will be*, reviewing assesses what *is*.

**Planning context (new or modified infrastructure):**

Everything starts as a gap — nothing exists yet. The status reflects what the plan does about each gap.

| Status | Meaning | Affects Execution Gate? |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| **REMEDIATE** | Gap — plan includes the fix. User sees what's being added on their behalf. | No |
| **ACCEPTABLE** | Gap — plan doesn't address it, acceptable at this tier per enforcement rules. User can request remediation. Also used when the default state inherently satisfies the requirement (e.g., "no wildcard principals" on a bucket with no policy — no gap exists). | No (user is warned at `warn`+ tiers) |
| **BLOCKED** | Gap — plan doesn't address it, enforcement rules require resolution. User must modify the plan. | Yes — must resolve before execution |

**Review context (existing infrastructure):**

Binary assessment of current state.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **PASS** | Item is compliant |
| **FAIL** | Item is non-compliant |

**How enforcement determines ACCEPTABLE vs BLOCKED (for plans):**

| Enforcement | BLOCKED threshold | User can accept... |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| `optional` | Nothing blocked | All gaps |
| `warn` | Nothing blocked | All gaps (with warning) |
| `strict` | Critical/High/Medium blocked | Low only |
| `enforce` | All blocked | Nothing |

**The agent's default behavior is to REMEDIATE everything the enforcement level requires.** BLOCKED occurs when a required item is not addressed in the plan — whether the user asked to skip it in their initial request or after the plan was presented. The user's initial request preferences (e.g., "don't configure CloudWatch logging") do NOT override enforcement. Examples at strict enforcement:
- CloudWatch logging is Medium severity → user asks to skip → **BLOCKED** (Medium is at or above the strict threshold)
- Flow logs are High severity → user asks to skip → **BLOCKED** (High is at or above the strict threshold)
- Optional tags are Low severity → user asks to skip → **ACCEPTABLE** (Low is below the strict threshold)

The user's request triggers the gate, it does not bypass it. To change what enforcement requires, modify `config/environments/environments.yaml` — a tracked, reviewable git change.

**DO NOT** offer "accept gaps" or "proceed with gaps" options at `strict` or `enforce` enforcement levels for items at or above the blocking severity threshold. If enforcement blocks it, the only path forward is remediation or changing the config.

**DO NOT** apply different statuses to MVA items at the same severity level within the same enforcement tier. Enforcement is mechanical, not discretionary — if encryption (Critical) is BLOCKED, then every other Critical item must also be BLOCKED. If CloudWatch logging (Medium) is BLOCKED, then every other Medium item must also be BLOCKED. The agent does not get to choose which items at a given severity to enforce.

**DO NOT** invent item-specific exceptions to enforcement rules. There is no category of items (logging, monitoring, operational, etc.) that gets special treatment. Enforcement is purely severity-based. If the severity is at or above the blocking threshold, the item is BLOCKED — regardless of what the item is, what pillar it belongs to, or whether the user requested it be skipped.

**Why two contexts matter:** A WAR on a plan evaluates what *will be built*. A WAR on existing infrastructure evaluates what *is there today*. PASS makes no sense for things that don't exist yet. REMEDIATE makes no sense for things that are already deployed. Using one status set for both produces contradictions (e.g., "PASS — Configured in plan" for a bucket that doesn't exist).

### Severity Definitions

| Severity | Definition | Examples |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Critical** | Security vulnerability or data loss risk | No encryption, public access to sensitive data, no backup |
| **High** | Significant operational or compliance risk | No logging, no monitoring, wide-open security groups |
| **Medium** | Best practice violation with moderate impact | No lifecycle policy, suboptimal instance type |
| **Low** | Minor improvement opportunity | Missing optional tags, no compression |

---

## Using This Skill

### For Planning (Orchestrator-Inline WAR)

The orchestrator performs WAR evaluation during Step 4a of the plan command, BEFORE constructing the plan. This ensures the plan already incorporates WAR findings.

The old template-based assessment is **DEPRECATED** and must not be used:

```
DEPRECATED — DO NOT USE:
| Pillar | Score | Notes |
| ... | emoji-only | |
```

Instead, use the structured WAR Findings Format above with MVA baseline comparisons.

### For Reviews

Use pillar checklists to validate existing infrastructure, then compare against MVA baselines for the environment tier.
