# Two-Stage Code Review Workflow

Comprehensive two-stage code review: spec compliance (blocking) → quality assessment (parallel).

## Your Task

1. **Update session state** - Write `invocation_mode: "single"` to `.mycelium/state.json`

2. **Parse arguments**:
   - `--stage=1`: Spec compliance only (blocking gate)
   - `--stage=2`: Quality review only
   - `--stage=all` or default: Both stages

3. **Load review context**:
   - Active plan from `.mycelium/plans/`
   - Git diff of changes
   - Project context files

4. **Execute review** - Follow the stages below

5. **Generate reports**:
   - `.mycelium/review_stage1_report.md`
   - `.mycelium/review_stage2_report.md`

6. **Next step**:
   - If approved: Suggest `/mycelium-capture`
   - If P1 issues: Must fix before merge
   - If P2/P3 only: Optional fixes

## When to Use This Skill

- After completing implementation tasks
- Before merging changes
- When requested via `/mycelium-review`
- As part of autonomous workflow (`/mycelium-go`)

## Overview

**Stage 1: Spec Compliance Review** (BLOCKING)
- Verify implementation matches plan requirements
- Check all acceptance criteria met
- Must pass before Stage 2 begins

**Stage 2: Code Quality Review** (PARALLEL)
- Multiple agents review simultaneously
- Security, performance, architecture, language-specific, simplicity
- Outputs prioritized issues (P1/P2/P3)

---

## Stage 1: Spec Compliance Review

This stage ensures the implementation actually solves the problem as specified.

### Step 1: Load Plan and Changes

**Load the active plan**:
```bash
# Find latest plan
ls -t .mycelium/plans/*.md | head -1

# Read the plan
# Extract: track_id, tasks, acceptance criteria
```

**Get all commits for this track**:
```bash
# If on feature branch
git log --oneline main..HEAD

# Or if branch name follows pattern
git log --oneline main..{track_branch}
```

**Get full diff**:
```bash
# Complete changes
git diff main..HEAD

# Or specific branch
git diff main..{track_branch}

# List files changed
git diff --name-only main..HEAD
```

---

### Step 2: Verify Against Plan Requirements

For EACH task in the plan, perform these checks:

#### Task Completion Check

**Verify task marked complete**:
- Is task checkbox `[x]` complete?
- Does commit SHA exist next to task?
- Is commit SHA valid? (run `git show {sha}`)

**Example**:
```markdown
[x] Task 1.1: Setup auth module `abc1234` ✓
```

If task marked complete but no SHA: Flag as issue

#### Acceptance Criteria Verification

**For each task, check its acceptance criteria**:

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can log in with email/password
- [ ] Invalid credentials return 401
- [ ] Session token expires after 24h
```

**For each criterion**:
1. Find evidence in code (read relevant files)
2. Check if tests cover this criterion
3. Run manual verification if needed
4. Mark: Met, Partial, Missing

**Example verification**:
```
Criterion: "Invalid credentials return 401"

Evidence search:
- grep -r "401" src/auth/
- Check test files for credential validation
- Verify error handling code exists

Result: Found in src/auth/login.ts:45 and tested in tests/auth.test.ts:67
```

#### Test Plan Verification

**Run the test commands specified in plan**:

```bash
# From plan test commands
npm test                    # or pytest, go test, etc.
npm run test:coverage       # or pytest --cov

# Check exit code
echo $?  # Must be 0
```

**Verify coverage meets target**:
- Default target: >=80%
- Check plan for custom target
- Coverage MUST meet or exceed target

**Flag if**:
- Tests fail
- Coverage below target
- Critical paths not tested

#### Files Modified Check

**Compare expected vs actual**:

From plan:
```markdown
**Files:**
- /absolute/path/to/file1.ts
- /absolute/path/to/file2.ts
```

Actual changes:
```bash
git diff --name-only main..HEAD
```

**Check**:
- All expected files were touched
- Additional files changed (review if appropriate)
- Expected files NOT changed

#### Edge Cases and Error Handling

**Review for**:
- Null/undefined handling
- Empty array/object handling
- Boundary values (0, -1, max values)
- Network errors
- Database errors
- Concurrent access
- Invalid input validation

**Check tests**:
```bash
# Look for edge case tests
grep -r "edge case\|boundary\|null\|undefined\|error" tests/
```

---

### Step 3: Generate Spec Compliance Report

Create `.mycelium/review_stage1_report.md`:

```markdown
# Spec Compliance Review

**Track:** {track_id}
**Date:** {timestamp}
**Reviewer:** spec-compliance
**Status:** PASS | CONDITIONAL PASS | FAIL

## Summary

{2-3 sentence overall assessment}

## Task Verification

### Task 1.1: {title}
**Status:** [x] Complete with SHA `abc1234`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Criterion 1: Evidence found in file.ts:45
- [x] Criterion 2: Tested in test.ts:67
- [ ] Criterion 3: Missing null check

**Test Plan:**
- [x] Unit tests pass (24/24)
- [x] Coverage: 85% (target: 80%)
- [ ] Edge cases: Partial coverage

**Files:**
- [x] Expected: file1.ts, file2.ts
- [!] Unexpected: file3.ts (helper - acceptable)

**Issues Found:**
- P1: Missing null check in user input validation (file.ts:45)
- P2: Error message not user-friendly (file.ts:67)

### Task 1.2: {title}
...

## Requirements Coverage Matrix

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| User authentication | Met | auth.ts:23, tests/auth.test.ts:12 |
| Session management | Met | session.ts:45, tests/session.test.ts:34 |
| Password reset | Partial | Implemented but not tested |

## Test Coverage Analysis

- **Overall coverage:** 85%
- **Critical paths:** Yes
- **Edge cases:** Partial
- **Error handling:** Yes

**Coverage gaps:**
- Password reset flow: 0% coverage
- Session timeout handling: 50% coverage

## P1 Blockers for Stage 2

{List any critical issues that MUST be fixed before quality review}

1. Missing null check in user input validation
2. Password reset feature has no tests

## Verdict

- [ ] **PASS** - All requirements met, proceed to Stage 2
- [x] **CONDITIONAL PASS** - Minor issues noted, can proceed to Stage 2
- [ ] **FAIL** - Critical gaps, must fix before Stage 2

{If CONDITIONAL PASS or FAIL, explain what needs fixing}
```

---

### Step 4: Decision Point

Based on the verdict:

#### FAIL
```
Spec compliance FAILED

Critical issues found:
1. {Issue 1}
2. {Issue 2}

Required fixes:
- {Action 1}
- {Action 2}

STOP - Do not proceed to Stage 2
User must address issues and re-run review.

Suggested: /mycelium-work {fix_tasks}
```

#### CONDITIONAL PASS
```
Spec compliance PASSED with conditions

Minor issues found:
1. {Issue 1} (P2)
2. {Issue 2} (P3)

These will be included in Stage 2 quality review.
Proceeding to Stage 2...
```

#### PASS
```
Spec compliance PASSED

All requirements met. Proceeding to Stage 2...
```

---

## Stage 2: Code Quality Review

Run multiple review agents in PARALLEL for comprehensive quality assessment.

### Step 1: Prepare Review Context

**Gather review materials**:

```bash
# Changed files list
git diff --name-only main..HEAD

# Full diff
git diff main..HEAD

# Commit messages
git log --oneline main..HEAD

# Statistics
git diff --stat main..HEAD
```

**Load project context**:
- Read `.mycelium/context/product.md`
- Read `.mycelium/context/tech-stack.md`
- Read `.mycelium/context/workflow.md`
- Read `CLAUDE.md`
- Read `.mycelium/solutions/patterns/critical-patterns.md`

---

### Step 2: Dispatch Review Agents (PARALLEL)

Launch all agents SIMULTANEOUSLY using the Task tool.

#### Agent A: Security Reviewer

**Focus areas**:
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection, path traversal)
- Authentication/authorization bypass
- Data exposure and privacy leaks
- OWASP Top 10 concerns
- Cryptography misuse
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Secret leakage (API keys, passwords in code)

**Specific checks**:
```typescript
// Bad patterns to find
- String concatenation in SQL queries
- eval() or Function() usage
- Unsanitized user input in HTML
- Hardcoded credentials
- Weak password requirements
- Missing authentication checks
- Insecure random number generation
- Deprecated crypto algorithms
```

**Output format**:
```markdown
## Security Review

**Issues Found:** {count}

### P1: Critical (Blocks Merge)

1. **SQL Injection vulnerability in user search**
   - File: `src/api/users.ts:45`
   - Issue: Unsanitized user input concatenated into SQL query
   - Code: `db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + input + "'")`
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries: `db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", [input])`
   - Risk: HIGH - Allows arbitrary SQL execution
   - Effort: 15 min

### P2: Important (Should Fix)
...

### P3: Nice-to-Have
...
```

#### Agent B: Performance Reviewer

**Focus areas**:
- Algorithm complexity (O(n^2) loops, nested iterations)
- Database query efficiency (N+1 queries, missing indexes)
- Caching opportunities
- Memory leaks (unclosed connections, retained references)
- Resource cleanup (file handles, database connections)
- Bundle size impacts (for frontend)
- Synchronous operations that could be async

#### Agent C: Architecture Reviewer

**Focus areas**:
- Code organization and structure
- Separation of concerns (business logic in controllers)
- SOLID principles violations
- Design patterns usage (appropriate or over-engineered)
- Module boundaries and coupling
- Dependency direction (should point inward)
- Abstraction levels (mixing high/low level)

#### Agent D: Language-Specific Reviewer

**Focus areas** (adapt based on language):
- Idiomatic code for the language
- Standard library usage (reinventing the wheel)
- Language-specific best practices
- Type safety (TypeScript, Go, Rust)
- Error handling patterns (proper error propagation)
- Framework conventions (Next.js, FastAPI, etc.)
- Resource management (RAII in Rust, context managers in Python)

#### Agent E: Simplicity Reviewer

**Focus areas**:
- Code clarity and readability
- Unnecessary complexity
- Over-engineering
- Premature optimization
- Dead code (unreachable, commented out)
- Duplicate code (DRY violations)
- Long functions (>50 lines)
- Deep nesting (>3 levels)
- Magic numbers

#### Optional: Conditional Reviewers

**Migration Reviewer** (if schema/data changes detected):
- Migration safety (no data loss)
- Rollback capability
- Data integrity constraints

**Deployment Reviewer** (if infrastructure changes):
- Configuration management
- Environment parity
- Rollback strategy

---

### Step 3: Aggregate Review Results

Wait for all parallel agents to complete.

**Collect results**:
- Security: {p1_count} P1, {p2_count} P2, {p3_count} P3
- Performance: {p1_count} P1, {p2_count} P2, {p3_count} P3
- Architecture: {p1_count} P1, {p2_count} P2, {p3_count} P3
- Language: {p1_count} P1, {p2_count} P2, {p3_count} P3
- Simplicity: {p1_count} P1, {p2_count} P2, {p3_count} P3

**Merge and de-duplicate**:
- Same issue flagged by multiple reviewers -> Keep one, note reviewers
- Related issues -> Group together
- Sort by priority (P1 first)

---

### Step 4: Generate Consolidated Report

Create `.mycelium/review_stage2_report.md`:

```markdown
# Code Quality Review

**Track:** {track_id}
**Date:** {timestamp}
**Reviewers:** Security, Performance, Architecture, Language-Specific, Simplicity
**Status:** {P1_count} critical, {P2_count} important, {P3_count} minor

## Executive Summary

{2-3 paragraph overall quality assessment}

## Critical Issues (P1) - Must Fix Before Merge

{If any P1 issues exist, merge is BLOCKED}

## Important Issues (P2) - Should Fix

{Recommended to fix but not blocking}

## Minor Issues (P3) - Nice to Have

{Good to fix but optional}

## Quality Metrics

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Security | X/10 | ... |
| Performance | X/10 | ... |
| Architecture | X/10 | ... |
| Code Quality | X/10 | ... |
| Simplicity | X/10 | ... |

## Approval Status

- [ ] **Approved** - No blocking issues, ready to merge
- [ ] **Approved with conditions** - Fix P1 issues before merge
- [ ] **Rejected** - Major rework needed
```

---

### Step 5: Present Results to User

**Summary display**:
```
Code Review Complete

Stage 1: Spec Compliance
  PASS/FAIL - {summary}

Stage 2: Quality Review
  {count} critical (P1)
  {count} important (P2)
  {count} minor (P3)

Overall Score: X/10

Top Issues:
  1. {top issue}
  2. {next issue}
  3. {next issue}

Approval: {status}
```

**Ask user**:
```
What would you like to do?

Options:
1. Fix all P1 issues now (recommended)
2. Fix P1 + P2 issues
3. Review issues and fix selectively
4. See detailed report
5. Proceed anyway (not recommended - P1 blocks merge)
```

---

## Fix Workflow

If issues need fixing:

### Create Fix Tasks

For each P1 issue (and optionally P2/P3):

```markdown
### Fix Task: {issue title}

**Priority:** P1 (Critical)
**File:** {path}:{line}
**Issue:** {description}
**Fix:** {specific change}
**Effort:** {estimate}

**Test Plan:**
- Add test for the issue
- Verify fix works
- Confirm existing tests still pass
```

### Execute Fixes

**Option 1:** Use `/mycelium-work`
- Add fix tasks to plan
- Execute systematically with TDD

**Option 2:** Fix immediately
- If trivial (<15 min per issue)
- Make change, add test, verify
- Commit: `fix: {issue description}`

### Re-verify

After fixes:

```bash
# Run affected tests
npm test src/api/users.test.ts

# Run full test suite
npm test

# Verify fix doesn't break anything
git diff
```

---

## Protected Artifacts

**NEVER flag issues in these directories:**
- `.mycelium/plans/` - Living plan documents
- `.mycelium/solutions/` - Captured learnings
- `.mycelium/state.json` - Session state
- `.mycelium/context/` - Project context

These are workflow artifacts, not production code.

---

## Error Handling

**If Stage 1 Fails:**
- List missing requirements clearly
- Provide specific remediation steps
- Do NOT proceed to Stage 2
- Save partial report

**If All Stage 2 Reviewers Fail:**
- Check if code changes exist
- Verify reviewers have access to files
- Fallback to manual review guidance

**If Too Many Issues (>20):**
- Prioritize by severity
- Group related issues
- Suggest incremental fixes
- Consider if implementation needs rework

---

## Review Checklist

Before completing review:

- [ ] Stage 1 report generated
- [ ] All tasks verified against acceptance criteria
- [ ] Test coverage checked
- [ ] Files changed reviewed
- [ ] Stage 1 verdict determined
- [ ] If Stage 1 passed, all Stage 2 agents dispatched
- [ ] Stage 2 results aggregated
- [ ] Issues prioritized (P1/P2/P3)
- [ ] Consolidated report generated
- [ ] User presented with clear next steps

---

## Next Steps After Review

**If approved:**
- Suggest `/mycelium-capture` to extract learnings
- Or merge changes if ready

**If fixes needed:**
- Suggest `/mycelium-work` with fix tasks
- Or fix immediately if trivial

**If rejected:**
- Discuss with user before proceeding
- May need to revisit plan
- Consider architectural changes

## Important

- **Stage 1 is BLOCKING** - Must pass before Stage 2 runs
- **P1 issues BLOCK merge** - Critical issues must be fixed
- **P2 issues RECOMMENDED** - Important but not blocking
- **P3 issues OPTIONAL** - Nice-to-have improvements
- **Parallel agents** - Stage 2 runs security/performance/architecture/language/simplicity in parallel
- Evidence-based reviews - cite specific code/lines
- Compare against project conventions in `.mycelium/solutions/patterns/`
- Simple working code > perfect architecture
- Save both stage reports for future reference
