# Single-Session AI Optimization Audit

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
**Document Version:** 1.1
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** ACTIVE
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This audit evaluates the AI-related infrastructure for efficiency: token waste,
skill overlap, hook latency, context management, and automation gaps. It covers
**12 domains** across **3 stages** with parallel agent execution.

---

## When to Use

- Tasks related to audit-ai-optimization
- User explicitly invokes `/audit-ai-optimization`

## When NOT to Use

- When the task doesn't match this skill's scope -- check related skills
- When a more specialized skill exists for the specific task

## Quick Reference

| Stage | Name              | Parallel Agents | Output                           |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1     | Core Efficiency   | 3               | `stage-1-*.jsonl`                |
| 2     | Extended Analysis | 5 (2 waves)     | `stage-2-*.jsonl`                |
| 3     | Synthesis         | 3               | `stage-3-*.jsonl` + final report |

**Total: 11 agents across 3 stages**

---

## Persistence Rules

See Agent Return Protocol in `.claude/skills/_shared/AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md`.
Additionally: verify all output files exist after each stage before proceeding
(`wc -l ${AUDIT_DIR}/*.jsonl`). Re-run any agent that fails to write its file.

---

## Pre-Audit Setup

### Step 0: Episodic Memory Search

Search for: `["ai-optimization", "token waste", "hook performance"]`

### Step 1: Check Thresholds

```bash
npm run review:check
```

### Step 2: Create Audit Directory

```bash
AUDIT_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
AUDIT_DIR="docs/audits/single-session/ai-optimization/audit-${AUDIT_DATE}"
mkdir -p "${AUDIT_DIR}"
```

### Step 3: Verify Output Directory Variable (CRITICAL)

Verify `AUDIT_DIR` is set, exists, and is a proper subdirectory (not root).

### Step 4: Load Baselines

Load `FALSE_POSITIVES.jsonl`, prior audit results, and count baseline metrics
(skill lines, hook lines, script count).

---

## Stage 1: Core Efficiency (3 Agents, Parallel)

**Goal:** Identify dead assets, fragile parsing, and token waste. All Stage 1
agents are independent. Stage 2 depends on Stage 1; Stage 3 depends on both.

### Agent 1A: Dead Assets

```
Task(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="""
Audit dead/orphaned documentation and scripts in this codebase:

**Dead Documentation:**
- Find .md files not referenced by any other file (grep for filename)
- Check docs/ for files with "DEPRECATED" or "ARCHIVED" that aren't in archive/
- Find docs with last-modified date >60 days old that aren't reference docs
- Check DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md for entries pointing to missing files

**Dead Scripts:**
- Find scripts/*.js files not referenced in package.json, hooks, or other scripts
- Check npm scripts in package.json for commands that reference missing files
- Find scripts with no callers (grep for filename across repo)
- Check .claude/hooks/*.js for unused hook scripts

**Output Format:** JSONL with one finding per line:
{"category":"ai-optimization","title":"...","fingerprint":"ai-optimization::FILE::dead-TYPE","severity":"S2|S3","effort":"E0|E1","confidence":0-100,"files":["path"],"why_it_matters":"...","suggested_fix":"...","acceptance_tests":["..."]}

CRITICAL: Write findings to: ${AUDIT_DIR}/stage-1a-dead-assets.jsonl
Use the Write tool. Return ONLY: COMPLETE: 1A wrote N findings to ${AUDIT_DIR}/stage-1a-dead-assets.jsonl
""")
```

### Agent 1B: Fragile Parsing & Format Waste

```
Task(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="""
Audit fragile parsing patterns and format waste:

**Fragile Parsing (Domains 3-4):**
- Find regex-heavy markdown parsing that could use a library or line-split
- Check for multi-line regex with greedy quantifiers (ReDoS risk)
- Find scripts parsing JSON with regex instead of JSON.parse
- Check for string manipulation where path.join/path.resolve should be used

**Format Waste:**
- Find verbose console.log output in hooks (token cost per session)
- Check for redundant status messages that repeat information
- Find scripts generating human-readable output that's only machine-consumed
- Check JSONL files for fields that are always null/empty

**Output Format:** JSONL per finding:
{"category":"ai-optimization","title":"...","fingerprint":"ai-optimization::FILE::ISSUE","severity":"S1|S2|S3","effort":"E0|E1|E2","confidence":0-100,"files":["path"],"why_it_matters":"...","suggested_fix":"...","acceptance_tests":["..."]}

CRITICAL: Write findings to: ${AUDIT_DIR}/stage-1b-parsing-format.jsonl
Return ONLY: COMPLETE: 1B wrote N findings to ${AUDIT_DIR}/stage-1b-parsing-format.jsonl
""")
```

### Agent 1C: AI Instruction Bloat

```
Task(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="""
Audit AI instruction efficiency (Domain 5):

**SKILL.md Bloat:**
- Measure line counts of all .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md files
- Flag skills >500 lines — check for duplicated boilerplate
- Compare skills that share >50% content (should reference shared base)
- Check for example code blocks >20 lines (should be external files)

**CLAUDE.md Efficiency:**
- Check CLAUDE.md for content that could be in on-demand reference docs
- Verify the progressive disclosure model is working (Tier 1-4)
- Check if any Tier 1 content exceeds the ~120 line budget

**Hook Prompt Bloat:**
- Check .claude/hooks/*.js for inline prompts >10 lines
- Find hooks that read large files into prompt context unnecessarily
- Check SessionStart output size (tokens consumed per session start)

**Output Format:** JSONL per finding:
{"category":"ai-optimization","title":"...","fingerprint":"ai-optimization::FILE::ISSUE","severity":"S2|S3","effort":"E0|E1|E2","confidence":0-100,"files":["path"],"why_it_matters":"...","suggested_fix":"...","acceptance_tests":["..."]}

CRITICAL: Write findings to: ${AUDIT_DIR}/stage-1c-instruction-bloat.jsonl
Return ONLY: COMPLETE: 1C wrote N findings to ${AUDIT_DIR}/stage-1c-instruction-bloat.jsonl
""")
```

### Stage 1 Checkpoint

```bash
# Verify all Stage 1 outputs exist
for f in stage-1a-dead-assets.jsonl stage-1b-parsing-format.jsonl stage-1c-instruction-bloat.jsonl; do
  if [ ! -s "${AUDIT_DIR}/$f" ]; then
    echo "MISSING: $f — re-run agent"
  else
    echo "OK: $f ($(wc -l < "${AUDIT_DIR}/$f") findings)"
  fi
done
```

**Subprocess Overhead:**
- Find hooks that call `node scripts/...` for simple checks
- Check for redundant process spawning (same script called by multiple hooks)
- Find hooks that read large files (>10KB) synchronously

- Verify progressive disclosure tiers work (Tier 1 always, Tier 2-4 on-demand)
- Find skills that read entire large files when they only need a section
- Check for hooks that inject large blocks into conversation context

**Unnecessary Reads:**
- Find patterns where the same file is read multiple times in a skill
- Check for skills that read files not relevant to their domain

""")
```

### Stage 2 Checkpoint

Verify all 5 stage-2 JSONL files exist and are non-empty before proceeding.

---

## Stage 3: Synthesis (3 Agents, Parallel)

**Goal:** Identify automation gaps, cross-cutting patterns, and priority
ranking.

### Agent 3A: Automation Gaps

```
Task(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="""

Read ALL Stage 1 and Stage 2 findings from ${AUDIT_DIR}/stage-*.jsonl.

**Identify:**
- Manual processes that should be automated
- Checks that exist but aren't wired into hooks/CI

""")
```

### Agent 3B: Cross-Cutting Patterns

```
Task(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="""
Analyze cross-cutting patterns across all audit findings:

Read ALL Stage 1 and Stage 2 findings from ${AUDIT_DIR}/stage-*.jsonl.

**Identify:**
- Patterns that appear across multiple domains (e.g., same issue in hooks AND skills)
- Systemic issues (e.g., all scripts missing error handling)
- Root causes that explain multiple findings
- Cascading issues (fixing A would also fix B, C)

**Output Format:** JSONL per pattern:
{"category":"ai-optimization","title":"Cross-cutting: ...","fingerprint":"ai-optimization::cross-cutting::PATTERN","severity":"S1|S2","effort":"E1|E2|E3","confidence":0-100,"files":["file1","file2"],"why_it_matters":"...","suggested_fix":"...","acceptance_tests":["..."]}

CRITICAL: Write findings to: ${AUDIT_DIR}/stage-3b-cross-cutting.jsonl
Return ONLY: COMPLETE: 3B wrote N findings to ${AUDIT_DIR}/stage-3b-cross-cutting.jsonl
""")
```

### Agent 3C: Synthesis & Priority Ranking

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="""
Synthesize all findings into a prioritized report:

Read ALL findings from ${AUDIT_DIR}/stage-*.jsonl.

**Create two outputs:**

1. **Deduplicated findings JSONL** — Merge all stage findings, remove duplicates
   (same fingerprint), merge related findings into composite items where appropriate.
   Write to: ${AUDIT_DIR}/all-findings-deduped.jsonl

2. **Executive summary report** with:
   - Total findings by severity (S0/S1/S2/S3)
   - Top 10 highest-impact items (sorted by severity then effort)
   - Domain heatmap: which of the 12 domains has most findings
   - Quick wins: S2+ items with E0 effort
   - Recommended action plan (grouped by sprint/phase)

   Write to: ${AUDIT_DIR}/AI_OPTIMIZATION_AUDIT_REPORT.md

CRITICAL: Write BOTH files. Return ONLY: COMPLETE: 3C wrote N deduped findings + report
""")
```

### Stage 3 Checkpoint

```bash
for f in stage-3a-automation-gaps.jsonl stage-3b-cross-cutting.jsonl all-findings-deduped.jsonl AI_OPTIMIZATION_AUDIT_REPORT.md; do
  if [ ! -s "${AUDIT_DIR}/$f" ]; then
    echo "MISSING: $f — re-run agent"
  else
    echo "OK: $f"
  fi
done
```
