# Form System Skill

## Purpose

This skill enforces the project form system conventions automatically during form development. It ensures consistent patterns for form hooks, field components, focus management, validation, server action integration, and accessibility.

## Activation

This skill activates when:

- Creating forms with `useAppForm` hook
- Using field components (`TextField`, `TextareaField`, `SelectField`, `SwitchField`, `CheckboxField`, `ComboboxField`, `TagField`)
- Implementing focus management with `withFocusManagement`
- Setting up form validation with Zod schemas
- Creating custom form dialogs or form-based features
- Using `form.AppField` for field rendering
- Using `form.SubmitButton` or `form.AppForm` wrappers
- Using `useStore` from `@tanstack/react-form` for form value access
- Using `formOptions` from `@tanstack/form-core` for reusable form configurations
- Implementing field listeners or programmatic field operations
- Integrating forms with `useServerAction` hook

## Workflow

1. Detect form work (imports from `@/components/ui/form` or `useAppForm`)
2. Load `references/Form-System-Conventions.md`
3. Generate/modify code following all conventions
4. Scan for violations of form patterns
5. Auto-fix all violations (no permission needed)
6. Report fixes applied

## Key Patterns

### Form Setup

- Use `useAppForm` hook from `@/components/ui/form`
- Wrap form components with `withFocusManagement` HOC
- Configure validation with `validators: { onSubmit: zodSchema }`
- Use `revalidateLogic` for validation timing
- Handle invalid submissions with `onSubmitInvalid` and `focusFirstError`
- Always set `canSubmitWhenInvalid: true`

### Field Rendering

- Use `form.AppField` with field components (`TextField`, etc.)
- Each field supports `label`, `description`, `isRequired`, `focusRef`, and `testId` props
- Use field `listeners` for side effects (onChange, onBlur)

### Form Submission

- Wrap `form.handleSubmit()` in event handler with `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()`
- Integrate with `useServerAction` hook for server actions
- Use `form.SubmitButton` wrapped in `form.AppForm` for automatic loading state

### Accessing Form Values

- Use `useStore` from `@tanstack/react-form` for reactive access
- Access via `useStore(form.store, (state) => state.values.fieldName)`
- Never access form values directly during render

### Programmatic Operations

- Use `form.setFieldValue()` to update field values
- Use `form.validateField()` to trigger validation
- Use field listeners for dependent field updates

### Server Action Options

- `toastMessages` for loading/success/error toasts
- `isDisableToast: true` for background operations
- `onSuccess` callback for post-submission logic
