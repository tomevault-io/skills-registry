# ML Vulnerabilities — Skill Entry

This `SKILL.md` is the **entrypoint** for the ML Vulnerabilities skill.

The skill encodes the **OWASP Machine Learning Security Top 10** as structured, machine-readable references
that an agent can query to identify, assess, and remediate machine learning security risks.

## Normative references (ML Top 10)

1. [00 Vulnerability Index](references/00-vulnerability-index.md)
2. [01 Input Manipulation Attack](references/01-input-manipulation-attack.md)
3. [02 Data Poisoning Attack](references/02-data-poisoning-attack.md)
4. [03 Model Inversion Attack](references/03-model-inversion-attack.md)
5. [04 Membership Inference Attack](references/04-membership-inference-attack.md)
6. [05 Model Theft](references/05-model-theft.md)
7. [06 AI Supply Chain Attacks](references/06-ai-supply-chain-attacks.md)
8. [07 Transfer Learning Attack](references/07-transfer-learning-attack.md)
9. [08 Model Skewing](references/08-model-skewing.md)
10. [09 Output Integrity Attack](references/09-output-integrity-attack.md)
11. [10 Model Poisoning](references/10-model-poisoning.md)
