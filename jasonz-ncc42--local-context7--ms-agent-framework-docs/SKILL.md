# Microsoft Agent Framework Documentation

Microsoft Agent Framework is a comprehensive SDK for building AI agents in .NET and Python. It provides abstractions for AI integration (Azure AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama), tool execution, Model Context Protocol (MCP), durable agents with state persistence, workflows, and multi-channel adapters (Teams, WebChat, DirectLine).

## Quick Reference

| FAQ & nightly builds | `references/docs/FAQS.md` |
| .NET samples | `references/dotnet/samples/README.md` |
| .NET getting started | `references/dotnet/samples/GettingStarted/README.md` |
| Python samples | `references/python/samples/README.md` |
| Architecture decisions | `references/docs/decisions/README.md` |
| Durable agents TTL | `references/docs/features/durable-agents/durable-agents-ttl.md` |
| Azure Functions hosting | `references/dotnet/samples/AzureFunctions/README.md` |
| Workflows | `references/dotnet/samples/GettingStarted/Workflows/README.md` |

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks about:
- Building AI agents with Microsoft Agent Framework
- .NET or Python agent development
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and clients
- Durable agents and session state management
- Agent tools and tool execution
- Teams, WebChat, or DirectLine adapters
- Agent-to-agent (A2A) communication
- Azure AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, or Ollama integration
- AG-UI (Agent UI) protocol implementation
- Workflows and orchestration patterns
- Azure Functions agent hosting

## How to find information

1. **First**, read `references/STRUCTURE.md` to see all available documentation files
2. Identify the relevant section/files based on the user's question
3. Read specific files for detailed information

**STRUCTURE.md contains a complete file listing organized by directory - always check it first before searching.**
