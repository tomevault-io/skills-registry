# @tank/node-express

Purpose: deliver actionable patterns for production Express APIs with predictable middleware, validation, auth, and operations.

Core Philosophy

- Fail loud, fail fast: reject invalid input at the edge, do not guess.
- Middleware is the architecture: cross-cutting behavior lives in ordered middleware, not in handlers.
- Types at the boundary: validate external data with schemas, then trust internal types.
- Observable by default: logs, request IDs, and errors are first-class outputs.
- Production-friendly defaults: graceful shutdown and safe timeouts are non-optional.

Project Structure

- `src/app.ts`
- `src/server.ts`
- `src/routes/index.ts`
- `src/routes/users.routes.ts`
- `src/middleware/auth.ts`
- `src/middleware/error.ts`
- `src/middleware/rateLimit.ts`
- `src/middleware/requestId.ts`
- `src/middleware/validate.ts`
- `src/controllers/users.controller.ts`
- `src/services/users.service.ts`
- `src/db/client.ts`
- `src/schemas/users.schema.ts`
- `src/config/env.ts`
- `src/logging/logger.ts`
- `src/health/health.routes.ts`
- `test/api/users.test.ts`

Operating Workflow

- Boot `app.ts` with middleware order, then mount routes.
- Keep handlers thin: parse, call service, return response.
- Push domain logic into services/ with explicit inputs/outputs.
- Centralize errors in `middleware/error.ts`.
- Export `server.ts` to control listening and shutdown.

Quick Decision Trees

- Middleware vs Route Handler
  - Cross-cutting across routes: middleware (request IDs, auth)
  - Per-resource behavior: handler (create user)
  - Transform input/output: middleware (validation, response envelopes)
  - Business logic: handler/service (billing, scheduling)

Error Handling Strategy

- Expected client errors: throw typed error + map in error middleware.
- Async handler failures: async wrapper + error middleware.
- Downstream dependency failures: translate to 503/504 with retry metadata.
- Unknown exceptions: log with request ID, return 500.

Authentication Method Selection

- Stateless API, mobile clients: JWT.
- Server-rendered web app: session cookie.
- Third-party login: OAuth exchange for session/JWT.

Capability Map

- Middleware ordering, error boundaries, and async wrappers.
- Request validation with Zod at the edge.
- Auth strategies: JWT, session, OAuth handoff.
- API design: routes, envelopes, pagination, DTOs.
- Production ops: shutdown, logging, health checks, Docker.

Input Expectations

- Provide existing routes or controllers if they must be preserved.
- State persistence layer (Prisma, Drizzle, raw SQL) and DB type.
- Identify auth mode and token/session storage.
- Share operational constraints (K8s, PM2, Docker).

Output Format

- Provide middleware order and placement guidance.
- Provide code snippets in TypeScript by default.
- Return explicit error and response formats.
- Note tradeoffs and safe defaults.

Activation Triggers

- node, node.js, express, express.js, api server, rest api, backend, middleware, route handler, router, endpoint, request validation, zod, jwt, session auth, oauth, rate limiting, error handling, graceful shutdown, structured logging

Non-Goals

- Do not design UI or front-end components.
- Do not prescribe ORM choice unless asked.
- Do not embed secrets or credentials.
- Do not skip validation in favor of speed.

Common Tasks

- Add request validation middleware with Zod schemas.
- Build error mapping for typed errors and unknowns.
- Add JWT verification and role gating.
- Add rate limiting and request ID logging.
- Set up graceful shutdown with connection draining.
- Define response envelope and pagination.

Operational Standards

- Enforce request validation with Zod at every entry route.
- Standardize error envelope and problem details.
- Add correlation IDs, log latency, and response status.
- Use graceful shutdown with connection draining.
- Prefer cursor pagination for large collections.

Anti-Patterns

- Don't put auth logic inside handlers; use centralized auth middleware.
- Don't swallow errors with empty catch; throw typed errors, map centrally.
- Don't accept unknown request bodies; validate with Zod and strip unknowns.
- Don't build responses ad hoc; use `{ data, error, meta }` envelope.
- Don't use global mutable singletons; inject dependencies per app instance.
- Don't skip shutdown handlers; implement SIGTERM/SIGINT with drain.
- Don't log plain strings; use structured JSON with requestId.
