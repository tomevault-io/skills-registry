# Tailor CV and Cover Letter

Adapt Javier Aguilar's CV and generate a cover letter tailored to a specific role.

## Inputs

One of:
- **Job URL** - fetched and analyzed via WebFetch
- **Job description text** - pasted directly by user
- **Recruiter message** - extracted requirements from informal message

Plus optional user instructions (e.g., "emphasize Langfuse experience", "focus on Python").

## Workflow

1. **Read portfolio context**
   - Read `src/data/projects.ts` for project list
   - Read `src/i18n/en.json` for project descriptions and outcomes
   - If user provides additional context about unlisted experience, incorporate it

2. **Analyze job requirements**
   - If URL: fetch with WebFetch and extract requirements
   - If text/message: parse directly
   - Extract: role title, company, must-have skills, nice-to-have skills, domain, language requirements, location constraints

3. **Match and strategize**
   - Rank top 3-4 projects by relevance to the role
   - Identify which skills to highlight (e.g., Python vs TypeScript, AWS vs GCP)
   - Determine the CV "angle" (e.g., "Agentic AI Engineer", "MLOps Engineer", "Full-Stack AI")
   - Note any user-specific instructions for emphasis

4. **Generate CV** as `docs/cvs/Javier_Aguilar_[Role]_[Company].md`
5. **Generate Cover Letter** as `docs/cvs/Cover_Letter_[Role]_[Company].md`
6. **Convert to DOCX and PDF** using pandoc

```

## Tailoring Rules

- **Mirror job language**: Use their exact terminology (e.g., "observability" not "monitoring" if that's what they say)
- **Lead with matches**: First bullet under Sapira AI should directly address the #1 job requirement
- **Quantify outcomes**: Use metrics from project outcomes (">95% accuracy", "40% cost reduction", "processing under 2 min/doc")
- **Bold matching tech**: If job says "Langfuse", bold **Langfuse** in skills and bullets
- **Adapt title**: Match role title to job (AI Engineer, MLOps, GenAI Consultant, etc.)
- **Location**: Show "London, UK (EU/Schengen)" when EU location is relevant
- **Languages section**: Move up if multilingual requirement mentioned

## Document Conversion

### DOCX

```bash
cd docs/cvs && pandoc "Javier_Aguilar_[Role]_[Company].md" -o "Javier_Aguilar_[Role]_[Company].docx" && pandoc "Cover_Letter_[Role]_[Company].md" -o "Cover_Letter_[Role]_[Company].docx"
```

### PDF

Uses xelatex for proper font rendering and link styling. CV uses tighter margins (1.5cm), cover letter uses wider margins (2cm).

```bash
cd docs/cvs && pandoc "Javier_Aguilar_[Role]_[Company].md" -o "Javier_Aguilar_[Role]_[Company].pdf" --pdf-engine=xelatex -V geometry:margin=1.5cm -V fontsize=11pt -V mainfont="Helvetica" -V colorlinks=true -V linkcolor=blue -V urlcolor=blue && pandoc "Cover_Letter_[Role]_[Company].md" -o "Cover_Letter_[Role]_[Company].pdf" --pdf-engine=xelatex -V geometry:margin=2cm -V fontsize=11pt -V mainfont="Helvetica" -V colorlinks=true -V linkcolor=blue -V urlcolor=blue
```
