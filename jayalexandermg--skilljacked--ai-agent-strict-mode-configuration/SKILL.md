# AI Agent Strict Mode Configuration

Enable strict compilation modes to shift error burden from runtime to build-time for AI-generated code.

## Quick Start
```typescript
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Core Workflow

**When setting up AI agent development environments:**
1. Enable strict mode in your primary language's compiler configuration
2. Configure null value checking
3. Enable implicit type detection and enforcement
4. Set strict typing requirements
5. Verify build-time error catching is active

**When agents generate code:**
1. Run strict compilation before execution
2. Fix all compiler errors before runtime
3. Let compiler handle type safety instead of runtime checks

## Techniques

### TypeScript Configuration
```typescript
// tsconfig.json - Essential settings
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,           // Enable all strict checks
    "noImplicitAny": true,    // Catch implicit any types
    "strictNullChecks": true, // Enforce null/undefined handling
    "strictFunctionTypes": true
  }
}
```

### Multi-Agent Isolation Pattern
- Use separate work trees for each agent when implementing multiple features
- Implement features in isolation on separate branches
- Merge agent outputs after individual completion
- Apply strict mode to each isolated implementation

## Anti-Patterns

**NEVER rely on runtime error checking for AI agents** - They lack built-in runtime error handling mechanisms.

**NEVER skip strict mode configuration** - Runtime failures are harder to debug than build-time errors.

**NEVER merge agent code without strict compilation** - Unverified merges introduce runtime vulnerabilities.

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

**Overlapping Task Descriptions:** When multiple agents have overlapping responsibilities, maintain strict mode across all implementations to catch conflicts early.

**Legacy Code Integration:** Apply strict mode incrementally when integrating with existing codebases that lack strict configuration.

**Multi-Language Projects:** Configure equivalent strict modes for each language in the stack (TypeScript strict, Python mypy, etc.).
