# Roast Review Skill

This skill performs a code review by asking Gemini to "roast" the codebase, then translating the roast into actionable feedback.

## Why This Works

When asked to "roast" code, LLMs surface the most glaring issues - the things that would stand out to any developer. This is a useful heuristic for finding high-priority problems.

## Configuration

### Supported Models

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| `gemini-3-pro-preview` | Most thorough analysis (recommended) |
| `gemini-3-flash-preview` | Fast, good quality |
| `gemini-2.5-pro` | High quality, large context |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Default, balanced |

### Repomix Caching

The script caches repomix output in `{tempdir}/repomix-{hash}.txt`. Use `--no-cache` to regenerate.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Determine Scope

Ask the user what to roast:
- Entire repository (default)
- Specific directory (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`)

### Step 2: Run the Roast

```bash
# Set target and output paths
TARGET_DIR="$(pwd)"  # or "$(pwd)/src" for specific directory
ROAST_OUTPUT="/tmp/roast-$(echo -n "$TARGET_DIR" | md5sum | cut -c1-12).md"

# Run the roast (use --repo for subdirectory)
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/repo_query.py --quiet --model gemini-3-pro-preview --output "$ROAST_OUTPUT" \
  "Roast this repo. Be brutally honest about what's wrong. For EVERY issue, include the specific file path and line number(s) in the format 'file.py:123' or 'file.py:100-150'. Point out bad practices, code smells, missing features, poor organization, security issues, and anything else problematic."
```

### Step 3: Report Token Usage

The script outputs token usage and cost. Report this to the user:
```
Token usage: X input, Y output, Z total
Estimated cost: $0.XXXX (model-name)
```

### Step 4: Read and Present Results

1. Use Read tool to get the roast from `$ROAST_OUTPUT`
2. Present the roast to the user
3. Translate each issue into constructive feedback with this format:

```
## Code Review Summary

### Critical Issues
- **[file:line]** Issue description → Recommendation

### High Priority
- **[file:line]** Issue description → Recommendation

### Medium Priority
- **[file:line]** Issue description → Recommendation

### Low Priority
- **[file:line]** Issue description → Recommendation

### Positive Observations
- What's good about the codebase
```

For each roasted issue:
- Extract the file:line reference
- Rewrite harshly-worded criticism as constructive feedback
- Add specific, actionable recommendation
- Prioritize by severity

### Step 5: Validate Flagged Issues

**IMPORTANT**: Gemini may hallucinate file paths, line numbers, or issues that don't exist. You MUST validate each flagged issue.

For each issue with a `file:line` reference:

1. Use the Read tool to read the flagged file at the specified line(s)
2. Verify the issue actually exists in the code
3. Mark each issue with a validation status:

```
## Validated Issues

### Critical Issues
- **[file:line]** ✅ VERIFIED - Issue description → Recommendation
- **[file:line]** ❌ NOT FOUND - Gemini claimed X but the code shows Y

### Unverified Issues
- Issues where file/line couldn't be located or code differs significantly
```

Validation criteria:
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: The code at that location clearly shows the described issue
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL**: The issue exists but at a different line or in modified form
- ❌ **NOT FOUND**: File doesn't exist, line is out of range, or code doesn't match the claim
- 🤔 **SUBJECTIVE**: The "issue" is a style/opinion matter, not an objective problem

If more than 30% of issues fail validation, warn the user that the roast may be unreliable and suggest re-running with a different model.

## Examples

**User**: "Roast this repo"
**Action**: Run on current directory, read output, present with recommendations

**User**: "Roast the src directory"
**Action**: Run with `--repo src/`, read output, present with recommendations

**User**: "Quick roast"
**Action**: Use `--model gemini-2.5-flash` for faster results

## Requirements

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
- `google-genai`: `pip install google-genai`
- `repomix`: `npm install -g repomix` (or via npx)
