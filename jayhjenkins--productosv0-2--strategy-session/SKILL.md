# Strategy Session

## Purpose

Conduct systematic strategic decision-making with:
- Auto-context assembly (research + meetings)
- Rigorous framework application with specific findings
- Concrete scenario analysis and quantitative grounding
- Stakeholder mapping when relevant
- Risk assessment with likelihood/impact ratings
- Structured session artifacts for memo generation

## When to Use

Activate when:
- User invokes `/strategy:session`
- Strategic decision needed
- Multiple options require systematic evaluation

## Workflow

### 1. Define Session Topic

**Ask user:**
- Topic (competitive-analysis, pricing-strategy, product-strategy, market-positioning, etc.)
- Specific decision question to address
- Time horizon (tactical: 3-6 months, strategic: 12+ months)
- Key stakeholders (optional)

**Document:**
- Create session folder: `/datasets/strategy/sessions/{YYYY}/{MM-DD}_{topic}/`
- Initialize `session-log.md` with metadata

### 2. Gather Research Context

**Invoke:** `research-gathering` skill

**Parameters:**
- Topic matching session focus
- Exclude expired sources (default)
- Include related topics if relevant

**Output to:** `{session-folder}/context.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown

### 9. Offer Memo Generation

**Ask user:** "Generate formal strategy memo from this session?"

**If yes:**
- Announce: "I'm using strategy-memo to create formal documentation"
- **Invoke:** `strategy-memo` skill
- Provide session folder path

**If no:**
- Confirm session artifacts saved
- Note memo can be generated later with `/strategy:memo`

## Session Quality Checklist

**Before marking session complete:**

- [ ] Context assembled with research sources (citations ready)
- [ ] Customer/meeting signals synthesized
- [ ] Framework selected and applied rigorously
- [ ] Framework findings documented with specific insights
- [ ] Options developed with concrete scenarios
- [ ] Each option includes pros/cons with evidence
- [ ] Quantitative analysis where appropriate
- [ ] Trade-offs analyzed systematically
- [ ] Recommendation clear with multi-point rationale
- [ ] Success metrics specific and measurable
- [ ] Risks assessed with likelihood/impact
- [ ] Risk mitigations documented
- [ ] All session artifacts written to folder

**Quality flags - need more work if:**
- Vague recommendations without concrete action
- Missing quantitative grounding for quantifiable decisions
- Options lack concrete scenarios or examples
- Framework applied superficially without specific findings
- Success metrics not measurable or no timeline
- Risks identified without mitigation strategies
- Unsupported projections or speculation

## File Structure

**Session folder:** `/datasets/strategy/sessions/{YYYY}/{MM-DD}_{topic}/`

**Required files:**
- `context.md` - Research and meeting context
- `framework.md` - Framework application and findings
- `session-log.md` - Interactive discussion and option analysis
- `recommendations.md` - Final recommendation with rationale

**Optional files:**
- `scenarios.md` - If extensive scenario modeling
- `stakeholders.md` - If detailed stakeholder analysis
- `data.csv` or `analysis.xlsx` - If quantitative modeling

## Success Criteria

- Context systematically assembled from research and meetings
- Framework applied rigorously with specific findings
- Options analyzed with concrete scenarios
- Quantitative data included where decision benefits from it
- Trade-offs analyzed explicitly
- Recommendation backed by framework and evidence
- Success metrics measurable with timelines
