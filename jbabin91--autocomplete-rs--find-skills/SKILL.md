# Find Skills

## Overview

Searches the open agent skills ecosystem and installs matching skills via the Skills CLI (`pnpm dlx skills`). Includes an enrichment script that fetches descriptions from skills.sh for each result, giving users context beyond raw skill names.

**When to use:** User asks for help with a domain that might have existing skills, wants to browse available skills, or asks to extend agent capabilities.

**When NOT to use:** User already knows the exact skill and install command, or the task has nothing to do with skill discovery.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                              | Correct Pattern                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using `npx skills`                   | Use `pnpm dlx skills` for consistent package management  |
| Forgetting `-y` on install           | Add `-y` to skip interactive confirmation prompts        |
| Vague search terms like "help"       | Use specific keywords: "react testing", "pr review"      |
| Not checking skills.sh first         | Browse `https://skills.sh/` for curated listings         |
| Installing without reviewing         | Check the skill page on skills.sh before installing      |
| Installing without `-a claude-code`  | Always specify agent: `-a claude-code` (or target agent) |
| Using `owner/repo` for private repos | Use SSH URL: `git@github.com:Org/repo.git`               |
| Running enrichment without Node.js   | Script requires Node.js with `https` module (built-in)   |

## Delegation

- **Skill search execution**: Run `pnpm dlx skills find` or the enrichment script directly
- **Skill installation**: Run `pnpm dlx skills add` after user confirms
- **Detailed skill info**: Browse the skill page on skills.sh before recommending

> If the `skill-management` skill is available, delegate skill creation, auditing, and validation to it.
> Otherwise, recommend: `pnpm dlx skills add oakoss/agent-skills -s skill-management -a claude-code -y`

If no matching skill is found, offer to help directly and suggest `pnpm dlx skills init` to create a custom skill.
