# Mermaid Diagrams

## Overview

Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions into SVG diagrams. It supports flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ER diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, Gantt charts, pie charts, mindmaps, and git graphs directly inside Markdown files.

**When to use:** Documenting system architecture, visualizing data models, illustrating request flows, creating project timelines, embedding diagrams in GitHub/GitLab READMEs or docs sites.

**When NOT to use:** Pixel-perfect design mockups, interactive dashboards, diagrams requiring custom artwork or complex spatial layouts beyond hierarchical/relational structures.

## Quick Reference

| Diagram        | Declaration          | Key Points                                           |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Flowchart      | `flowchart TD`       | Directions: TB, TD, BT, RL, LR. Supports subgraphs   |
| Sequence       | `sequenceDiagram`    | Participants, messages, loops, alt/opt/par blocks    |
| ER Diagram     | `erDiagram`          | Crow's foot notation, PK/FK/UK attributes            |
| Class Diagram  | `classDiagram`       | UML relationships, visibility modifiers, annotations |
| State Diagram  | `stateDiagram-v2`    | Transitions, composite states, forks/joins, choice   |
| Gantt Chart    | `gantt`              | Sections, tasks with dates/durations, milestones     |
| Pie Chart      | `pie`                | Labels with numeric values, optional title           |
| Mindmap        | `mindmap`            | Indentation-based hierarchy, multiple node shapes    |
| Git Graph      | `gitGraph`           | Commits, branches, merges, cherry-picks, tags        |
| Architecture   | `architecture-beta`  | Services in groups, directional edges (T/B/L/R)      |
| Block Diagram  | `block-beta`         | Column layout, block arrows, nested blocks           |
| Timeline       | `timeline`           | Time periods with events, sections for grouping      |
| Sankey         | `sankey-beta`        | Flow quantities between nodes, CSV-like data format  |
| XY Chart       | `xychart-beta`       | Bar and line charts with x/y axes                    |
| Quadrant Chart | `quadrantChart`      | Four-quadrant plot with labeled axes and data points |
| Kanban         | `kanban`             | Columns with task cards, assignees, priorities       |
| Packet         | `packet-beta`        | Network packet structure with bit-range fields       |
| Requirement    | `requirementDiagram` | Requirements, elements, and verification links       |
| C4 Diagram     | `C4Context`          | C4 model: Context, Container, Component, Deployment  |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                   | Correct Pattern                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using `graph` instead of `flowchart`      | Use `flowchart` for subgraph edges and newer features      |
| Missing space after arrow in sequences    | `Alice->>Bob: msg` not `Alice->>Bob:msg`                   |
| Wrong cardinality order in ER diagrams    | Left cardinality, then line, then right cardinality        |
| Forgetting `end` after subgraph/loop/alt  | Every block keyword requires a matching `end`              |
| Using reserved words as node IDs          | Wrap reserved words in quotes or use aliases               |
| Bare code blocks without language tag     | Always use ` ```mermaid ` as the language specifier        |
| Mixing v1 and v2 state diagram syntax     | Use `stateDiagram-v2` consistently for current features    |
| Unquoted labels with special characters   | Wrap labels containing special characters in double quotes |
| Missing `dateFormat` in Gantt charts      | Always declare `dateFormat` before task definitions        |
| Using tabs instead of spaces for mindmaps | Mindmap indentation requires spaces, not tabs              |

## Delegation

- **Diagram discovery and exploration**: Use `Explore` agent to find existing diagrams in the codebase
- **Diagram review**: Use `Task` agent to verify diagram accuracy against code
- **Architecture documentation**: Use `code-reviewer` agent for doc quality checks
