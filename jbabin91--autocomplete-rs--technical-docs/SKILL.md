description: Technical documentation writing and diagram generation. Use when creating docs, syncing documentation with code changes, building Mermaid diagrams, running doc coverage audits, or establishing writing style guides. Use for doc-as-code workflows, ERD generation, sequence diagrams, documentation gap analysis, and AI-assisted drafting. Use when this capability is needed.

# Documentation

Technical writing, diagram-as-code, and documentation lifecycle management. Treats docs as code: version-controlled, linted, and CI-verified.

**When to use**: Creating or updating technical documentation, generating Mermaid diagrams (flowcharts, ERDs, sequence diagrams), auditing documentation coverage against code, or establishing style guides.

**When NOT to use**: Writing marketing copy, blog posts, or content that does not live alongside code.

## Quick Reference

| Task                 | Approach                                        | Key Point                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Doc sync audit       | `git diff main...HEAD` + export scan            | Compare symbols against doc coverage         |
| Sequence diagram     | Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` + `autonumber`        | Map messages to function calls               |
| ERD                  | Mermaid `erDiagram` + Crow's Foot               | Derive from Drizzle/Prisma schemas           |
| Gitgraph             | Mermaid `gitGraph`                              | Standardize on main/develop/feature branches |
| Feature release doc  | Overview + Config + Examples + Troubleshooting  | Checklist for every new feature              |
| API reference        | Generate from JSDoc/TSDoc annotations           | Never write API refs manually                |
| Style guide          | Active voice + present tense + direct address   | Conversational but precise                   |
| AI-assisted drafting | Inventory + gap analysis + draft + human review | AI drafts, humans verify accuracy            |
| Markdown standard    | YAML frontmatter + language-tagged code blocks  | Always specify code block language           |
| Complex diagrams     | Split into focused sub-diagrams + subgraphs     | Limit to 15-20 nodes per diagram             |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                     | Correct Pattern                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Using static images for technical diagrams  | Write Mermaid syntax inline in Markdown                      |
| Generic participant names like `Agent1`     | Use specific service or role names matching the architecture |
| Manually writing API reference docs         | Generate from JSDoc/TSDoc annotations in source code         |
| Diagrams with 20+ nodes and no grouping     | Use subgraphs to group related nodes; limit to 15-20         |
| Documentation referencing outdated defaults | Run doc sync audit comparing exports against coverage        |
| Using "Click here" link text                | Use descriptive anchor text for accessibility and clarity    |
| Skipping heading hierarchy levels           | Never go from H2 to H4; keep hierarchy sequential            |
| Mixing wall-of-text paragraphs              | Use bullet points, tables, and diagrams for scannability     |

## Delegation

- **Scan codebase for undocumented exports and documentation gaps**: Use `Explore` agent
- **Generate a full documentation site with diagrams from an existing codebase**: Use `Task` agent
- **Plan documentation architecture and information hierarchy for a new project**: Use `Plan` agent

> If the `mermaid-diagrams` skill is available, delegate complex diagram creation and advanced Mermaid syntax questions to it.
> Otherwise, recommend: `pnpm dlx skills add oakoss/agent-skills -s mermaid-diagrams -a claude-code -y`
