# Agent Creator

Generate specialized agents for autonomous task handling in Claude Code.

## When to Use

- Creating task-specific agents (code review, testing, research)
- Building autonomous workflows
- Specialized analysis agents
- Multi-step task automation
- Agent-driven development patterns

## Agent System Overview

Agents are specialized Claude instances with:

- **Focused purpose**: Specific task or domain
- **Autonomy**: Can make decisions and use tools
- **Context**: Loaded with relevant skills and knowledge
- **Model selection**: Choose appropriate model (haiku, sonnet, opus)

## Core Workflow

### 1. Gather Requirements

Ask the user:

- **Purpose**: What specific task does this agent handle?
- **Model**: Which model? (haiku=fast/cheap, sonnet=balanced, opus=complex)
- **Skills**: Which skills should the agent have access to?
- **Tools**: Which tools can the agent use?
- **Constraints**: Any limitations or guardrails?
- **Location**: Project-local or global?

### 2. Generate Agent Definition

**Location:**

- Global: `~/.claude/skills/super-claude/plugins/[plugin]/agents/agent-name.md`
- Project: `/path/to/project/.claude/agents/agent-name.md`

**Format:**

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
model: sonnet|haiku|opus
description: Clear description of agent's purpose
---

# Agent Name

## Purpose

3. Principle 3 (e.g., "Provide detailed reports")

## Workflow

1. Step 1: Action
2. Step 2: Action
3. Step 3: Action

## Quality Standards

- performance-optimizer

## Model Selection Guide

### Haiku (Fast & Cheap)

- Simple, repetitive tasks
- Quick analysis
- High-volume operations
- Examples: formatter, simple validators

### Sonnet (Balanced)

- Most common choice
- Code review
- Test generation
- Refactoring
- Examples: code-reviewer, test-generator

### Opus (Complex Reasoning)

- Deep analysis
- Research tasks
- Architecture decisions
- Complex problem-solving
- Examples: researcher, architect

## Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility**: One clear purpose per agent
2. **Clear Constraints**: Define what agent can/cannot do
3. **Quality Standards**: Specific success criteria
4. **Appropriate Model**: Match model to task complexity
5. **Tool Access**: Only tools needed for the task

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Multi-purpose agents (do one thing well)
- ❌ Vague purpose or workflow
- ❌ No quality standards
- ❌ Wrong model choice (opus for simple tasks)
- ❌ Too many tool permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Performing Well

**Solution**:

- Check model selection (may need upgrade/downgrade)
- Refine operational principles
- Add more specific skills
- Clarify success criteria

### Agent Taking Too Long

**Solution**:

- Use faster model (sonnet → haiku)
- Narrow scope
- Add time constraints
- Break into smaller agents
