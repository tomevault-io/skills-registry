# Skill Creator

A meta-skill for generating new Claude Code skills with proper structure and validation.

## When to Use

- Creating project-specific skills (e.g., "Odyssey design system components")
- Building work-related skills (e.g., "SD API client generation")
- Generating custom workflow automations
- Standardizing team practices into reusable skills
- Converting manual processes into automated skills

## Core Workflow

### 1. Gather Requirements

Ask the user:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this skill solve?
- **Triggers**: What keywords/phrases should activate it?
- **Context**: When should it be used (file types, project types)?
- **Location**: Where to save (global or project-local)?
- **Dependencies**: Required tools, packages, or other skills?

### 2. Generate Skill Structure

**Template Reference:** See `templates/skill_template.md` for the complete skill template with all available fields and examples.

Create a properly formatted SKILL.md with:

```yaml
---
# OFFICIAL CLAUDE CODE FIELDS (recognized by Claude Code)
name: skill-identifier                    # Required: kebab-case
description: |                            # Required: What it does AND when to activate
  Clear description of what it does and when to use it.
  IMPORTANT: Include activation triggers in the description itself.
  Example: "Generate React components. Use when creating new UI components."
allowed-tools: []                         # Optional: Restrict to specific tools

# EXTENDED METADATA (ignored by Claude Code, useful for organization)
version: 1.0.0                           # Track changes (skills are files, not packages)
---

# Skill Name

Brief overview (1-2 sentences).

```

### 3. Validate Against Specifications

Ensure the skill follows:

**Anthropic Best Practices:**

- ✅ Clear, actionable instructions
- ✅ Specific triggers (not generic)
- ✅ Real examples (not placeholders)
- ✅ Token-efficient (< 500 lines for core content)
- ✅ Progressive disclosure (link to API_REFERENCE.md if needed)

**RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Ready:**

- ✅ Can be tested without the skill (RED phase)
- ✅ Verifiable compliance (GREEN phase)
- ✅ Hardened against rationalizations (REFACTOR phase)

**Community Patterns:**

- ✅ No TODOs or placeholders in production
- ✅ No "YOUR_KEY_HERE" style configs
- ✅ Specific, not generic labels
- ✅ Context-aware activation

### 4. Save to Appropriate Location

**Global Skills** (general use across all projects):

```txt
~/.claude/skills/super-claude/plugins/[category]/skills/skill-name.md
```

**Project-Local Skills** (specific to one project):

```txt
/path/to/project/.claude/skills/skill-name.md
```

**Note**: Project-local skills are perfect for work-specific or proprietary patterns that shouldn't be shared globally.

### 5. Test the Skill

Provide testing guidance:

- RED: Try the workflow WITHOUT the skill, note failures
- GREEN: Enable the skill, verify it works
- REFACTOR: Identify edge cases, harden the skill

## Skill Types

### Standard Skill (Most Common)

General-purpose automation or guidance for specific tasks.

### Component Generator

Creates code/files following specific patterns.

### Workflow Orchestrator

Coordinates multiple steps or tools.

### Validation/Checker

Ensures code/config meets standards.

### Migration Helper

Assists in moving between technologies.

## Advanced Features

### Progressive Disclosure

If skill exceeds 500 lines, split into:

- **SKILL.md**: Core instructions (< 500 lines)
- **API_REFERENCE.md**: Advanced topics (loaded on-demand)

Link from SKILL.md:

```markdown
For advanced usage, see [API_REFERENCE.md](./API_REFERENCE.md)
```

### Context-Aware Activation

Make skills activate automatically:

```yaml
triggers:
  keywords: [specific, technical, terms]
  patterns: ['regex.*patterns']
  contexts: [file-types, project-types]
```

### Dependencies

Declare requirements:

```yaml
requires:
  tools: [git, npm, docker]
  skills: [typescript/tsc-validation]
  packages: ['@types/node']
```

## Auto-Activation System

### Overview

Skills can auto-activate based on user prompts using the skill-rules.json system. This enables Claude to proactively suggest relevant skills before responding.

**For complete details, see:** [SKILL_ACTIVATION_GUIDE.md](../../docs/SKILL_ACTIVATION_GUIDE.md)

### When to Add Activation Rules

Add skill-rules.json entries when:

- Skill is part of a plugin (not project-local)
- Skill should auto-activate from specific keywords
- Skill addresses a common workflow pattern
- Skill is high-value and frequently needed

**Skip activation rules for:**

- One-off project-specific skills
- Rarely-used experimental skills
- Skills that should only run on explicit user request

### Creating skill-rules.json Entries

**For plugin developers:** Add entries to `plugins/{plugin}/skills/skill-rules.json`

**Schema:**

```json
{
  "plugin": {
    "name": "plugin-name",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "namespace": "namespace"
  },
  "skills": {
    "skill-name": {
      "type": "domain",
      "enforcement": "suggest",
      "priority": "high",
      "description": "Brief description of what the skill does",
      "promptTriggers": {
        "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
        "intentPatterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Writing Good Keywords

**✅ Good Keywords** (specific, unambiguous):

```json
"keywords": [
  "create skill",
  "new skill",
  "skill template",
  "generate skill",
  "skill development"
]
```

**❌ Bad Keywords** (too generic):

```json
"keywords": [
  "create",
  "new",
  "help",
  "build"
]
```

**Rules for keywords:**

- Minimum 2 words for specificity
- Include the domain (e.g., "skill", "hook", "component")
- Match how users naturally ask for help
- Case-insensitive literal matching
- No regex needed for keywords

### Writing Good Intent Patterns

**✅ Good Patterns** (capture intent, not exact wording):

```json
"intentPatterns": [
  "(create|add|generate|build).*?skill",
  "how to.*?(create|add|build).*?skill",
  "skill.*?(template|generator|builder)",
  "need.*?skill.*?(for|to)",
  "(make|write).*?skill"
]
```

**❌ Bad Patterns** (too broad or too narrow):

```json
"intentPatterns": [
  ".*skill.*",
  "^create exactly this specific phrase$"
]
```

**Rules for patterns:**

- Use regex with case-insensitive flag (`i`)
- Include action verbs: create, add, generate, build, make
- Include domain terms: skill, hook, component, etc.
- Use `.*?` for flexible matching between keywords
- Capture natural variations of the same intent

### Priority Guidelines

**critical** - Must run for safety/correctness:

```json
"priority": "critical"
// Examples: security validators, syntax checkers
```

**high** - Highly recommended:

```json
"priority": "high"
// Examples: skill-creator, component-generator
```

**medium** - Useful but optional:

```json
"priority": "medium"
// Examples: documentation generators, formatters
```

**low** - Nice-to-have:

```json
"priority": "low"
// Examples: experimental features, rarely-used tools
```

### Example: skill-creator Activation Rules

```json
{
  "plugin": {
    "name": "meta",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "namespace": "claude"
  },
  "skills": {
    "skill-creator": {
      "type": "domain",
      "enforcement": "suggest",
      "priority": "high",
      "description": "Generate new Claude Code skills with proper structure and validation",
      "promptTriggers": {
        "keywords": [
          "create skill",
          "new skill",
          "skill development",
          "generate skill",
          "skill template"
        ],
        "intentPatterns": [
          "(create|add|generate|build).*?skill",
          "how to.*?(create|add|build).*?skill",
          "skill.*?(template|generator|builder)",
          "need.*?skill.*?(for|to)",
          "(make|write).*?skill"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Migration Tool

Use `/generate-skill-rules` to auto-generate entries from existing SKILL.md YAML frontmatter:

```sh
# Preview generated rules
/generate-skill-rules --plugin plugins/tanstack-tools --namespace tanstack

# Write to skill-rules.json
/generate-skill-rules --plugin plugins/api-tools --namespace api --write
```

### Testing Activation Rules

**Test in isolated project:**

```sh
# 1. Create test project
mkdir test-activation && cd test-activation

# 2. Copy hook and rules
mkdir -p .claude/hooks .claude/skills/your-plugin
cp {hook-path}/skill-activation-prompt.ts .claude/hooks/
cp {plugin-path}/skill-rules.json .claude/skills/your-plugin/

# 3. Test with prompts
echo '{"prompt":"create a new skill","cwd":"'$(pwd)'"}' | \
  bun run .claude/hooks/skill-activation-prompt.ts
```

**Expected output:**

```txt
============================================================
SKILL ACTIVATION CHECK
============================================================

[RECOMMENDED] SKILLS:
  -> skill-creator

ACTION: Use Skill tool BEFORE responding
============================================================
```

### Workflow: Adding Auto-Activation to New Skills

When creating a skill that should auto-activate:

1. **Create the SKILL.md** (as normal)

2. **Identify triggers** by asking:
   - What keywords would users type to need this skill?
   - What questions or requests indicate this intent?
   - How do users naturally express this need?

3. **Add to skill-rules.json**:

   ```json
   {
     "skills": {
       "new-skill": {
         "type": "domain",
         "enforcement": "suggest",
         "priority": "high",
         "description": "What the skill does",
         "promptTriggers": {
           "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
           "intentPatterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Test the triggers**:
   - Try prompts that SHOULD activate it
   - Try prompts that should NOT activate it
   - Refine keywords/patterns based on results

5. **Document in SKILL.md**:

   ```markdown
   ## Auto-Activation

   This skill auto-activates when you mention:

   - Creating/generating {domain objects}
   - Specific workflow requests
   - Related keywords

   Triggered by: create skill, new skill, generate skill
   ```

### Project-Level Overrides

Users can customize activation in their projects via `.claude/skills/skill-rules.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "overrides": {
    "claude/skill-creator": {
      "priority": "critical"
    }
  },
  "disabled": ["claude/skill-validator"],
  "global": {
    "maxSkillsPerPrompt": 3,
    "priorityThreshold": "medium"
  }
}
```

**Command for users:** `/workflow:configure`

## Example: Creating a Project-Specific Skill

**User Request:**
"Create a skill for generating Odyssey design system components"

**Generated Skill:**

Location: `/path/to/odyssey-project/.claude/skills/odyssey-components.md`

```yaml
---
name: odyssey-components
version: 1.0.0
description: |
  Generate components following Odyssey design system guidelines.
  Ensures consistency with design tokens, patterns, and accessibility standards.
category: design-system
tags: [odyssey, components, design-system, react]
model: sonnet
requires:
  tools: [npm]
  packages: ["@odyssey/design-tokens", "@odyssey/components"]
triggers:
  keywords: [odyssey, odyssey component, design system]
  patterns: ["create.*odyssey", "generate.*odyssey"]
---

# Odyssey Components

Generate React components that follow Odyssey design system standards.

## When to Use

- Creating new Odyssey components
- Ensuring design system compliance
- Maintaining consistency across products

## Component Structure

All components follow this pattern:

\`\`\`
components/
  └── ComponentName/
      ├── ComponentName.tsx
      ├── ComponentName.stories.tsx
      ├── ComponentName.test.tsx
      └── index.ts
\`\`\`

## Design Token Usage

Always use design tokens from `@odyssey/design-tokens`:

\`\`\`typescript
import { tokens } from '@odyssey/design-tokens'

const styles = {
  color: tokens.color.primary.base,
  spacing: tokens.spacing.md,
  borderRadius: tokens.borderRadius.md
}
\`\`\`

## Accessibility Requirements

All components must:
- Meet WCAG AAA standards
- Include proper ARIA labels
- Support keyboard navigation
- Provide focus indicators

## Example: Button Component

[Detailed example following Odyssey patterns]
```

## Common Skill Patterns

### API Client Generator

```yaml
name: project-api-client
purpose: Generate type-safe API clients from OpenAPI schemas
includes: OpenAPI schema parsing, type generation, RPC helpers
location: project-local (for proprietary APIs)
```

### Component Library Helper

```yaml
name: design-system-components
purpose: Generate components following project design system
includes: Component patterns, theme support, testing
location: project-local (for proprietary design systems)
```

### Database Schema Generator

```yaml
name: drizzle-schema-from-db
purpose: Generate Drizzle schemas from existing Postgres database
includes: Type inference, relationship mapping, migration helpers
location: global (reusable across projects)
```

### Deployment Automation

```yaml
name: coolify-deployment
purpose: Automate deployment to Coolify platform
includes: Docker config, environment setup, rollback procedures
location: global (reusable deployment pattern)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Don't create "helper" or "utility" skills - be explicit about what they do
2. **Include Examples**: Real, working examples - not placeholders
3. **Test First**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology ensures quality
4. **Token Efficiency**: Keep core content under 500 lines
5. **Clear Triggers**: Specific keywords that clearly indicate when to activate
6. **Validate**: Always check against Claude Code and Anthropic specs

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Generic names ("helper", "utils", "tool")
- ❌ TODOs or placeholders in production
- ❌ Narrative examples tied to specific sessions
- ❌ Code embedded in flowcharts
- ❌ Missing activation triggers
- ❌ Over 500 lines without progressive disclosure
- ❌ Untested skills

## Integration with Other Tools

### shadcn CLI Integration

```bash
# Generate skill that wraps shadcn commands
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component]
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @coss/[component]
```

### Registry Support

Skills can integrate with component registries:

- shadcn/ui registry
- coss.com/ui registry
- Custom private registries

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating

**Symptom**: Skill exists but doesn't trigger
**Solution**:

- Check triggers section in YAML frontmatter
- Ensure keywords are specific enough
- Verify file is in correct location
- Check Claude Code loaded the skill (restart if needed)

### Skill Too Generic

**Symptom**: Skill triggers too often or in wrong contexts
**Solution**:

- Make keywords more specific
- Add context restrictions
- Use regex patterns to narrow activation

### Skill Too Large

**Symptom**: Skill exceeds 500 lines
**Solution**:

- Implement progressive disclosure
- Move advanced content to API_REFERENCE.md
- Keep core workflow in SKILL.md
