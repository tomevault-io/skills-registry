name: buyer-persona
description: Build and refine ideal customer profiles (ICPs) and buyer personas with pain points, motivations, and messaging guidance. Use this skill whenever someone needs to define their target buyer, create buyer personas, refine their ICP, understand a specific buyer type, says "who should we be selling to", "build a buyer persona for [role]", "define our ICP", "what does a [title] care about", or when developing messaging for a specific audience. Also trigger when someone mentions ideal customer profile, buyer journey, persona development, customer segmentation, or target market definition. Use when this capability is needed.

# Buyer Persona

Build detailed, actionable buyer personas that help reps understand who they're selling to and what those people actually care about. Good personas aren't demographic profiles — they're empathy tools that help your team see the world through your buyer's eyes.

## Why Personas Matter for Sales

- Reps who understand their buyer's daily reality build stronger rapport
- Messaging that speaks to specific pain points converts better than generic pitches
- Discovery is more productive when you know what questions to ask each persona
- Proposals land harder when they address the buyer's specific priorities
- Objection handling improves when you understand the buyer's real concerns

## Getting Started

- "Build a buyer persona for VP of Engineering at a mid-market SaaS company"

- "Map the typical buying committee for our product"
- "What does a Chief Revenue Officer care about?"
- "Help me create messaging that resonates with [persona]"
- "Map the buyer journey for our ICP"

## Execution Flow

### Step 0: Automatic Data Pull (Before Asking the User Anything)

**CRITICAL:** Before asking the user to describe their buyer, check what MCP tools are available and ground the persona in real data. Personas built from data beat personas built from assumptions.

#### CRM Data Pull

Check if you have access to CRM tools (look for tools containing `search_crm_objects`, `get_crm_objects`, or similar).

If CRM tools ARE available:

1. **Pull won deals to profile real buyers.** Search `deals` with `dealstage` = Closed Won stages, last 180 days.
   - Properties: `dealname`, `amount`, `dealstage`, `closedate`, `pipeline`, `hubspot_owner_id`, `dealtype`, `createdate`
   - Get associated `contacts` for these deals — their titles, roles, and seniority ARE your persona data
   - Get associated `companies` — industry, size, revenue = your ICP data

2. **Analyze contact titles.** From won deal contacts:
   - Group by `jobtitle` to find the most common buyer titles
   - Map titles to persona roles (Economic Buyer, Champion, Technical Evaluator)
   - Identify which titles appear in the most won deals (high-correlation personas)

3. **Build ICP from company data.** From won deal companies:
   - Calculate distributions: most common `industry`, `numberofemployees` ranges, `annualrevenue` ranges
   - These become the "Ideal" column in the ICP table — backed by real data, not guesses

#### Sales Intelligence Data Pull

Check if you have access to sales intelligence tools (look for tools prefixed with `zoominfo_`, `clay_`, `linkedin_`).

**ZoomInfo** (if available):
1. **Search contacts by target title.** Use `zoominfo_search_contact` with the target persona title, filtered by relevant industries.
   - Get: typical management level, department, seniority patterns
   - This validates whether the target title is common enough to be a real persona
2. **Search companies matching ICP.** Use `zoominfo_search_company` to validate ICP criteria.
   - Confirm company size, revenue ranges, and industry segments match real market data

**Clay** (if available):
1. **Enrich sample contacts.** Use `clay_enrich_person` on 2-3 real contacts from won deals.
   - Get enriched profiles: background, tenure, career path, social presence
   - These real profiles ground the "Professional Profile" section of the persona

**LinkedIn** (if available):
1. **Search leads by title and seniority.** Use `linkedin_search_leads` with the target persona title.
   - Validate typical seniority levels, geographic distribution
   - Identify common career paths for this persona type
2. **Get sample profiles.** Use `linkedin_get_profile` on 1-2 real contacts from won deals.
   - Career progression, skills, endorsements reveal what this persona values

#### Gong Data Pull

Check if you have access to Gong tools (look for tools prefixed with `gong_`).

If Gong tools ARE available:
1. **Search calls with this persona type.** Use `gong_search_calls` to find calls where contacts with this title participated.
2. **Analyze call patterns.** Use `gong_get_call_details` on 3-5 calls:
   - What topics do they raise? (reveals real pain points)
   - What questions do they ask? (reveals decision criteria)
   - What objections do they voice? (reveals real concerns)

#### Chat Data Pull

If chat tools are available (`slack_search_public`, `slack_search_public_and_private`):
1. Search for the persona title/role in sales channels
2. Look for observations about this buyer type from the field team
3. Surface win/loss stories involving this persona

#### Present What You Found

> "I analyzed **[N] won deals** from your CRM and found the most common buyer title is **[Title]** (appeared in [X]% of wins). Your best customers are **[Industry]** companies with **[N]-[N] employees**. I enriched [N] real contact profiles via ZoomInfo/Clay and found [N] Gong calls with this persona type. Building the persona from this data..."

### Step 1: Gather Remaining Context

After the auto-pull, ask ONLY for what the data doesn't tell you:

1. **Your product** — What you sell and what problem it solves (if not in memory/product.md)
2. **Your experience** — Qualitative observations about this buyer type that data can't capture
3. **Framework preference** — What mode do you want? (Persona, ICP, Buying Committee, Messaging, Journey)

When tools ARE connected, skip questions about company size, industry, and buyer titles — you already have that from CRM data.

### Step 2: Build the Persona

Combine ALL evidence: CRM deal patterns, enrichment profiles, Gong call insights, Slack observations, web research, and user input. Cite sources: "Per CRM (N=47 won deals):", "Per ZoomInfo:", "Per Gong:", "User reported:"

### Step 3: Store Insights

- Update `memory/icp.md` with validated ICP attributes from CRM data
- Update `memory/deal-patterns.md` with persona-to-outcome correlations
- Register the persona in `memory/content-registry.md`
