name: campaign-to-field
description: Bridge between marketing campaigns and field-ready sales materials — translate launches, campaigns, and messaging into talk tracks, email templates, and discovery angles that reps can actually use. Use this skill whenever marketing launches a campaign and sales needs to know how to leverage it, when there's a product launch and reps need positioning materials, when a rep says "marketing just launched X — how do I use this?", "what's the messaging for [campaign]?", or when aligning sales and marketing on go-to-market motions. Also trigger when someone mentions sales-marketing alignment, campaign enablement, field readiness, or launch readiness. Use when this capability is needed.

# Campaign to Field

Turn marketing campaigns into field-ready sales tools. Marketing creates campaigns, messaging, and content — but reps need specific guidance on how to use that in their conversations, emails, and deals. This skill bridges that gap.

## The Alignment Problem

Marketing launches a campaign: new positioning, new content, new ads. What happens next?

**Without this skill:** Reps get a Slack message saying "check out our new campaign!" and then... nothing changes in how they sell. Campaign ROI drops because the field doesn't adopt the messaging.

**With this skill:** The campaign is instantly translated into: talk tracks for each persona, email templates reps can send today, discovery questions that tie into campaign themes, objection responses that leverage new proof points, and a guide for which deals the campaign is most relevant to.

## Getting Started

- "Marketing just launched a new campaign around [theme] — make it field-ready"
- "We have a new case study — turn it into sales ammunition"
- "New feature launching next week — build the sales enablement kit"
- "Here's our updated messaging — translate it for the field"
- "New whitepaper dropped — how should reps use this in deals?"

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 0: Automatic Data Pull (Before Asking the User Anything)

**CRITICAL:** After receiving the campaign brief/materials from the user, immediately check what MCP tools are available and pull data to auto-generate the Deal Targeting section.

#### CRM Data Pull

Check if you have access to CRM tools (look for tools containing `search_crm_objects`, `get_crm_objects`, or similar).

If CRM tools ARE available:

1. **Pull active pipeline deals.** Search `deals` for open pipeline.
   - Properties: `dealname`, `amount`, `dealstage`, `closedate`, `pipeline`, `hubspot_owner_id`, `dealtype`, `description`, `createdate`
   - Assess which deals align with the campaign theme based on deal type, stage, and description

2. **Pull associated contacts and companies.** For high-relevance deals, get contacts and companies.
   - Match contact titles to campaign personas
   - Match company profiles to campaign ICP criteria

3. **Map rep names.** Use `search_owners` to identify which reps have deals that match the campaign target.

4. **Auto-populate the Deal Targeting table.** Instead of a generic template, list actual deals that should leverage this campaign:
   - High priority: Deals in Discovery/Demo stage matching campaign theme
   - Medium priority: Early-stage deals that could benefit from campaign content
   - Cite: "Per CRM: [Deal Name] is in [Stage] and matches campaign ICP"

#### Sales Intelligence Data Pull

**LinkedIn** (if available):
1. **Search for prospect profiles matching campaign ICP.** Use `linkedin_search_leads` with campaign persona titles.
   - Identify prospects in active pipeline deals who match campaign personas
   - This helps reps personalize campaign outreach to specific contacts

#### Calendar/Email Data Pull

If calendar/email tools are available (`outlook_calendar_search`, `outlook_email_search`):
1. Search for upcoming meetings with prospects matching campaign themes
2. Flag meetings in the next 2 weeks where reps could leverage new campaign materials
3. Add to Deal Targeting section: "Per Calendar: Meeting with [Company] on [Date] — use new talk track"

#### Chat Data Pull

If chat tools are available:
1. Search for any existing discussion about this campaign or launch
2. Identify which channels to distribute field-ready materials to
3. Surface rep questions or confusion about prior campaigns (to proactively address in FAQ)

#### Present What You Found

> "I analyzed your pipeline and found **[N] deals worth $[X]** that align with this campaign. **[N] of those have meetings in the next 2 weeks** where reps can use these materials. I've built the deal targeting list and identified the reps who should prioritize this. Here's your field enablement kit..."

### Step 1: Generate Field Enablement Kit

Build the complete kit using all evidence. Cite tool-sourced data: "Per CRM:", "Per Calendar:", "Per Slack:"

### Step 2: Store and Distribute

- Register new campaign content in `memory/content-registry.md`
- Update `memory/product.md` if the campaign reflects a positioning change
- Trigger content-health checks on related assets (battle cards, playbooks) that may need updating

| [Deal B] | Proposal | [Connection] | [Reference new case study] |
