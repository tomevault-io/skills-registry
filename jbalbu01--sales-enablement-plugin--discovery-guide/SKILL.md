name: discovery-guide
description: Run structured discovery calls using SPIN, Sandler, or Challenger frameworks with tailored question sets and call guides. Use this skill whenever a rep needs help preparing discovery questions, is about to do a first call with a new prospect, wants a discovery call template, says "what questions should I ask", "help me prepare for a discovery call", "I need a call guide", or is working on improving their discovery process. Also trigger when someone mentions SPIN selling, Sandler, Challenger, or gap selling in a sales context. Use when this capability is needed.

# Discovery Guide

Help reps run better discovery calls by asking the right questions in the right order. Discovery is the most important part of the sales process — everything downstream (demo, proposal, close) depends on how well you understand the prospect's situation.

## Why Discovery Matters

Bad discovery leads to generic demos, weak proposals, and lost deals. Good discovery:
- Uncovers the real problem (not just the stated one)
- Identifies all stakeholders and their priorities
- Quantifies the impact of the problem (sets up ROI conversations)
- Establishes urgency and timeline
- Gives you everything you need for a compelling demo and proposal

## Getting Started

- "Prepare discovery questions for my call with [Company]"
- "Give me a SPIN framework call guide for [industry/persona]"
- "What questions should I ask a VP of Engineering about [topic]?"
- "Build a discovery question library for our SDR team"
- "Review my discovery call transcript — did I miss anything?"

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 0: Automatic Data Pull (Before Asking the User Anything)

**CRITICAL:** Before asking for prospect context, pull everything available from connected tools. The best discovery calls start with thorough pre-call research — and tools can do that research in seconds.

#### CRM Data Pull

Check if you have access to CRM tools (look for tools containing `search_crm_objects`, `get_crm_objects`, or similar).

If CRM tools ARE available:

1. **Find the deal.** Search `deals` for the company/prospect name the user mentioned.
   - Properties: `dealname`, `amount`, `dealstage`, `closedate`, `pipeline`, `hubspot_owner_id`, `dealtype`, `description`, `notes_last_contacted`, `num_notes`
2. **Pull contacts.** Get associated contacts for the deal.
   - Properties: `firstname`, `lastname`, `jobtitle`, `email`, `phone`, `company`, `lifecyclestage`
   - Identify which contact the rep is meeting
3. **Pull company.** Get associated company data.
   - Properties: `name`, `domain`, `industry`, `numberofemployees`, `annualrevenue`, `description`, `about_us`, `founded_year`, `country`
   - Use this to pre-fill the "Pre-Call Context" and skip Situation Questions you already know answers to

#### Sales Intelligence Data Pull

Check if you have access to sales intelligence tools (look for tools prefixed with `zoominfo_`, `clay_`, `linkedin_`).

**ZoomInfo** (if available):
1. **Research the company.** Use `zoominfo_search_company` with the prospect company name/domain.
   - Company size, revenue, funding, tech stack, industry
2. **Get org chart.** Use `zoominfo_get_org_chart` to understand the prospect's reporting structure.
   - Who does your contact report to? (potential Economic Buyer)
   - Who reports to your contact? (potential users/influencers)
3. **Get tech stack.** Use `zoominfo_get_tech_stack` for the prospect company.
   - Know what tools they use today — feeds Situation Questions and competitive context

**Clay** (if available):
1. **Enrich the contact.** Use `clay_enrich_person` with the attendee's email or name+company.
   - Background, tenure, career path — personalization gold for building rapport

**LinkedIn** (if available):
1. **Get prospect profile.** Use `linkedin_get_profile` for the meeting attendee.
   - Career history, education, shared connections, recent activity
   - Feeds the "Build Rapport" section of the call guide
2. **Search the company.** Use `linkedin_search_companies` for company updates, hiring trends.

#### Gong Data Pull

Check if you have access to Gong tools (look for tools prefixed with `gong_`).

If Gong tools ARE available:

**For Call Prep mode:**
1. **Search for prior calls with this prospect.** Use `gong_search_calls` with company name or contact email.
2. **If prior calls exist,** pull transcripts and analytics:
   - What was discussed previously? (don't repeat questions they already answered)
   - What pain points were uncovered? (go deeper this time)
   - Were there any unresolved objections? (prepare for these)
   - What next steps were agreed? (follow up on commitments)

**For Call Review mode:**
1. **Pull the call transcript.** Use `gong_get_transcript` with the call ID.
2. **Pull call analytics.** Use `gong_get_call_details` for talk ratio, question count, topics.
3. Pre-fill the evaluation metrics with actual data.

#### Calendar/Email Data Pull

If calendar/email tools are available (`outlook_calendar_search`, `outlook_email_search`):
1. Search for the meeting details — attendees, agenda, any prep notes
2. Search email history with the prospect — prior correspondence reveals context
3. Check for any materials shared by or to the prospect

#### Present What You Found

> "I pulled context for your call with **[Name], [Title]** at **[Company]**: a **[industry]** company with **[N] employees** and **$[X] revenue**. Per ZoomInfo, they use [Tech Stack]. Per LinkedIn, [Name] has been in this role for [N] years, previously at [Company]. Per CRM, this is a **$[X] deal** in **[Stage]** stage. [If prior calls exist:] I found **[N] prior Gong calls** — last call covered [topics]. Building your discovery guide now..."

### Step 1: Gather Remaining Context

After the auto-pull, ask ONLY for what couldn't be found:
- **Framework preference** — SPIN, Sandler, Challenger, or "whatever works"
- **Your goal for this call** — What specific things do you need to learn?
- **What you sell** — If not in memory/product.md

When tools are connected, you already have prospect context, company data, and prior interaction history.

### Step 2: Generate the Call Guide

Build using ALL evidence. Mark Situation Questions as "SKIP — already known from research" when the answer is in the tool data. Cite: "Per CRM:", "Per ZoomInfo:", "Per Gong:", "Per LinkedIn:"

### Step 3: Store Insights

- After the call, update `memory/deal-patterns.md` with discovery findings
- Note the prospect's qualification status for the deal-qualification skill

## What I Need From You (When Tools Aren't Connected)

For a tailored call guide:

1. **Who are you meeting?** — Name, title, company
2. **What do you sell?** — Your product and key value propositions
3. **What do you know already?** — Any context from prior conversations or research
4. **What's the goal?** — First meeting? Follow-up? What do you need to learn?
5. **Framework preference?** — SPIN, Sandler, Challenger, or "whatever works"

---

## The SPIN Framework

The most universally applicable discovery framework. Questions progress through four stages, each building on the last:

### S — Situation Questions
Understand their current state. Keep these brief — don't interrogate. You should know most of this from research.

Purpose: Establish context without wasting the prospect's time.

### P — Problem Questions
Identify pain points, challenges, and gaps in their current approach.

Purpose: Get the prospect to articulate what's not working.

### I — Implication Questions
Explore the consequences of the problem. This is where deals are won or lost — most reps skip this entirely.

Purpose: Help the prospect realize the problem is bigger than they thought.

### N — Need-Payoff Questions
Get the prospect to describe how a solution would improve their situation. Let them sell themselves.

Purpose: The prospect articulates the value, not you.

## Question Library

When building a reusable question library, I'll organize questions by:

2. **Buyer persona** (C-suite, VP, Director, IC)
3. **Industry vertical** (SaaS, Healthcare, Financial Services, etc.)
4. **Topic area** (Budget, Timeline, Decision Process, Technical Requirements, etc.)

---

## Call Review Mode

Paste a transcript or notes from a discovery call, and I'll evaluate:

1. **Coverage** — Did you hit all four SPIN stages?
2. **Depth** — Did you go deep enough on implications?
3. **Balance** — Prospect talk time vs. rep talk time (aim for 60/40 prospect)
4. **Missed Opportunities** — Questions you should have asked
5. **Next Steps** — What to follow up on based on what was uncovered
