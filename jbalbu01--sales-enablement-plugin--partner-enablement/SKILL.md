description: Create enablement materials for channel partners, co-sell partners, and technology partners — partner playbooks, co-sell guides, joint value propositions, and partner onboarding kits. Use this skill when building partner sales materials, co-selling strategies, channel partner programs, joint go-to-market motions, or when someone says "enable our partners", "partner playbook", "co-sell guide", "channel partner kit", or "help partners sell our product". Also trigger when someone mentions partner ecosystem, alliance management, channel strategy, or co-marketing. Use when this capability is needed.

# Partner Enablement

Help channel, co-sell, and technology partners sell your product effectively. Partners are an extension of your sales team — but they have less context, less training, and less urgency. The materials need to be simpler, more self-serve, and more opinionated than internal enablement.

## Partner Types

- **Channel Partners / Resellers:** Sell your product as part of their portfolio
- **Co-sell Partners:** Sell alongside you into shared accounts
- **Technology Partners:** Integrate with your product and bring joint solutions to market
- **Referral Partners:** Send leads your way for a commission
- **Services Partners:** Implement your product for customers

Each type needs different enablement — a reseller needs a full playbook; a referral partner needs a one-pager.

## Execution Flow

### Step 0: Automatic Data Pull (Before Asking the User Anything)

**CRITICAL:** Before asking for partner context, pull data from connected tools. Partner materials are strongest when grounded in real deal data from the partner channel.

#### CRM Data Pull

Check if you have access to CRM tools (look for tools containing `search_crm_objects`, `get_crm_objects`, or similar).

If CRM tools ARE available:

1. **Pull partner-sourced deals.** Search `deals` for deals associated with the partner (by partner name, source, or deal type).
   - Properties: `dealname`, `amount`, `dealstage`, `closedate`, `createdate`, `pipeline`, `hubspot_owner_id`, `dealtype`, `description`, `closed_won_reason`, `closed_lost_reason`
   - Compute: partner channel win rate, avg deal size, avg cycle length
2. **Identify partner ICP from won deals.** Pull companies associated with partner-sourced won deals.
   - Properties: `name`, `industry`, `numberofemployees`, `annualrevenue`
   - Pattern: Which company profiles win through the partner channel? → Feeds "Who To Sell This To"
3. **Pull buying committee from partner wins.** Get contacts from partner-sourced won deals.
   - Properties: `firstname`, `lastname`, `jobtitle`, `email`
   - Pattern: Which titles appear in partner-closed deals? → Feeds "Best-Fit Personas"
4. **Analyze partner losses.** Pull closed-lost deals from partner channel.
   - Common loss reasons → Feeds "Common Objections" and training focus areas
5. **Check partner pipeline.** Pull open deals from partner channel.
   - Stage distribution → Shows where partners get stuck (enablement gap)

#### Sales Intelligence Data Pull

**ZoomInfo** (if available):
1. **Research the partner company.** Use `zoominfo_search_company` with the partner's company name.
   - Company size, focus areas, customer base → Tailor materials to partner's context
2. **Get partner customer tech stacks.** Use `zoominfo_get_tech_stack` on partner's existing customer base.
   - Common tech stacks → Integration positioning for the partner playbook

**Clay** (if available):
1. **Enrich the partner company.** Use `clay_enrich_company` with the partner domain.
   - Growth signals, recent changes, market positioning → Partner context

**LinkedIn** (if available):
1. **Get partner contact profiles.** Use `linkedin_get_profile` for partner sales leadership.
   - Background, priorities, communication style → Tailor materials to partner audience
2. **Search partner company updates.** Use `linkedin_search_companies` for partner company.
   - Recent initiatives, focus areas, market positioning → Align materials to partner strategy

#### Gong Data Pull

Check if you have access to Gong tools (look for tools prefixed with `gong_`).

If Gong tools ARE available:

1. **Find partner co-sell calls.** Use `gong_search_calls` with the partner company name.
   - How do partner reps currently position your product?
2. **Analyze joint call patterns.** Use `gong_get_call_stats` on partner-involved calls.
   - Talk-to-listen ratios, topics covered → Where do partners struggle?
3. **Extract positioning gaps.** Use `gong_get_transcript` on partner-led calls.
   - Where do partners misspeak about features or value props? → Training focus

#### Chat Data Pull

If chat tools are available (`slack_search_public`, `slack_search_public_and_private`):
1. Search for the partner name in partner/channel channels
2. Surface partner feedback, deal questions, and enablement requests
3. Look for common questions partners ask — these reveal enablement gaps

#### Present What You Found

> "I pulled data for the **[Partner]** channel: **[N] partner-sourced deals** in the last [period] — **[X]% win rate** with **$[X] avg deal size**. Per CRM, partners win most with **[company profile]** companies, and common loss reasons include **[reasons]**. [If Gong:] Found **[N] joint calls** — partners tend to [positioning pattern]. [If ZoomInfo:] Partner focuses on **[market/industry]** with **[N] customers**. Building partner materials now..."

### Step 1: Gather Remaining Context

After the auto-pull, ask ONLY for what the tools couldn't provide:
- **Partner type** — Channel, co-sell, technology, referral, or services?
- **Deliverable** — Playbook, co-sell guide, joint value prop, onboarding kit, or battle card?
- **Partner-specific context** — Margin structure, deal registration process, support SLA
- **Relationship nuance** — What the partner cares about, their competitive landscape

### Step 2: Generate Partner Materials

Build using ALL evidence. Use partner-channel deal data as primary evidence. Cite sources: "Per CRM (partner deals):", "Per Gong (joint calls):", "Per ZoomInfo:", "Per Slack:". Keep materials simpler than internal equivalents — partners have less time and context.

### Step 3: Store Insights

- Update `memory/deal-patterns.md` with partner channel patterns discovered
- Update `memory/content-registry.md` with new partner enablement assets
- Log in `memory/changelog.md`

## Design Principles for Partner Content

1. **Shorter is better.** Partners won't read 20 pages. Keep it under 5.
2. **Decision-ready, not information-rich.** "Sell this to companies with 50-500 employees" not "our product scales from SMB to enterprise."
3. **Scripted, not conceptual.** Give them exact words to say, not messaging frameworks.
4. **Self-serve.** Partners won't attend your training. Make materials that work without explanation.
5. **Focus on WIIFM.** What's in it for the partner? Lead with their margin, their customer value, their competitive advantage.
