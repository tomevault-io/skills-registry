description: Create comprehensive sales playbooks for products, segments, or sales motions. Use this skill whenever someone needs to build a sales playbook, create a new hire onboarding guide, document a sales process, standardize a sales motion, says "build a playbook for [product/segment]", "document our sales process", "create a selling guide", or when systematizing tribal knowledge into repeatable processes. Also trigger when someone mentions sales methodology documentation, go-to-market playbooks, vertical playbooks, or rep enablement guides. Use when this capability is needed.

# Playbook Builder

Create structured, actionable sales playbooks that turn your best reps' knowledge into a repeatable system the whole team can follow. A playbook isn't a PDF that sits on a shelf — it's a living reference that reps actually use in their day-to-day work.

## What Makes a Good Playbook

- **Actionable** — Every section answers "what do I do?" not just "what should I know?"
- **Scannable** — Reps look things up mid-conversation, not during study hall
- **Opinionated** — It takes a position on what works. "It depends" is useless guidance.
- **Evidence-based** — Grounded in what actually wins deals, not theory
- **Maintained** — Updated as the product, market, and competition evolve

## Getting Started

- "Create a vertical playbook for selling into healthcare"
- "Document our outbound sales motion"
- "Build an onboarding playbook for new AEs"
- "Help me systematize how our top reps sell"

## Execution Flow

### Step 0: Automatic Data Pull (Before Asking the User Anything)

**CRITICAL:** Before asking for tribal knowledge, pull every data point from connected tools. The best playbooks are grounded in actual win patterns, not theory.

#### CRM Data Pull

Check if you have access to CRM tools (look for tools containing `search_crm_objects`, `get_crm_objects`, or similar).

If CRM tools ARE available:

1. **Pull all closed deals (Won + Lost) for the last 6-12 months.**
   - Properties: `dealname`, `amount`, `dealstage`, `closedate`, `createdate`, `pipeline`, `hubspot_owner_id`, `dealtype`, `description`, `closed_lost_reason`, `closed_won_reason`
2. **Compute win metrics for the playbook:**
   - Win rate, avg deal size, avg cycle length
   - Win rate by deal type, pipeline, and company size
   - Most common loss reasons → feeds "Common Mistakes" sections
   - Stage conversion rates → feeds "Sales Process" exit criteria
3. **Identify ICP from won deals.** Pull companies associated with won deals:
   - Properties: `name`, `industry`, `numberofemployees`, `annualrevenue`
   - Cluster: What company size/industry/profile wins most? → feeds "Ideal Customer Profile"
4. **Identify buying committee from won deals.** Pull contacts from won deals:
   - Properties: `firstname`, `lastname`, `jobtitle`, `email`
   - Pattern: What titles are most common in won deals? → feeds "Buying Committee"
5. **Segment by rep.** Use `search_owners` to identify top performers.
   - What do top reps do differently? (deal size, cycle length, stage velocity)

#### Gong Data Pull

Check if you have access to Gong tools (look for tools prefixed with `gong_`).

If Gong tools ARE available:

1. **Pull call patterns for top performers.** Use `gong_search_calls_by_participant` + `gong_get_call_stats` for reps with highest win rates.
   - Talk-to-listen ratios → feeds "Discovery" best practices
   - Avg questions per call → feeds "Discovery Question Bank"
   - Topics covered → feeds "Key Value Drivers"
2. **Extract discovery questions.** Use `gong_get_transcript` on 3-5 top-performer discovery calls.
   - What questions do they consistently ask? → feeds "Discovery Question Bank"
3. **Extract objection patterns.** Use `gong_search_calls` with objection keywords.
   - Most frequent objections → feeds "Objection Handling Quick Reference"
   - How top reps handle them → feeds response scripts
4. **Extract competitive mentions.** Use `gong_get_call_details` to find competitor mentions.
   - What competitors come up? → feeds "Competitive Positioning"
   - How do top reps respond? → feeds competitive talk tracks

#### Sales Intelligence Data Pull

**ZoomInfo** (if available):
1. **Validate ICP.** Use `zoominfo_search_company` on won deal companies to verify company profiles.
   - Industry, size, tech stack patterns across wins
2. **Map competitor tech stacks.** Use `zoominfo_get_tech_stack` on won and lost deal companies.
   - What tools do your best customers use? → integration positioning

**LinkedIn** (if available):
1. **Validate buyer personas.** Use `linkedin_search_leads` for champion titles from won deals.
   - Career paths, backgrounds, common traits of your best buyers

#### Chat Data Pull

If chat tools are available:
1. Search for playbook-related discussions, win stories, and best practices shared by reps
2. Surface tribal knowledge that hasn't been formally documented

#### Present What You Found

> "I analyzed **[N] deals** from the last [period] — **[N] won** at **[X]% win rate** with **$[X] avg deal size** and **[X]-day avg cycle**. Top loss reasons: **[reason 1]**, **[reason 2]**. Per CRM, your best customers are **[size] [industry]** companies, and your typical buying committee includes **[titles]**. [If Gong:] Top performers have a **[X:Y] talk ratio** and ask **[N] questions per call**. Building your data-driven playbook now..."

### Step 1: Gather Remaining Context

After the auto-pull, ask ONLY for what the tools couldn't provide:
- **Playbook type** — Product, segment, motion, competitive, or new hire?
- **Product details** — Pricing, packaging, key differentiators (if not in memory/product.md)
- **Team insights** — What do your best reps do that isn't captured in data?
- **Known gaps** — What does the team struggle with most?

### Step 2: Generate the Playbook

Build using ALL evidence. Mark data-sourced sections: "Per CRM ([N] deals):", "Per Gong (top 5 reps):", "Per ZoomInfo:", "Per Slack:" The playbook should be grounded in what actually works, not generic frameworks.

### Step 3: Store Insights

- Update `memory/product.md` with product positioning documented in the playbook
- Update `memory/deal-patterns.md` with patterns discovered during analysis
- Update `memory/competitors.md` with competitive intelligence surfaced
- Register the playbook in `memory/content-registry.md`
- Log in `memory/changelog.md`

## What I Need From You (When Tools Aren't Connected)

The more context you provide, the more specific and useful the playbook:

1. **What you sell** — Product, pricing, key differentiators
2. **Who you sell to** — ICP, personas, typical buying committee
3. **How you sell** — Current process, sales stages, typical cycle length
4. **What works** — Your top reps' best practices, winning patterns
5. **What doesn't work** — Common mistakes, lost deal patterns
6. **Competitive landscape** — Who you compete against and how you differentiate

I'll supplement with research and proven frameworks, but your team's actual experience is the most valuable input.

## Tips for Building Great Playbooks

1. **Interview your top reps** — Their instincts contain gold that needs to be documented
2. **Include what NOT to do** — Failure patterns are as valuable as success patterns
3. **Keep it modular** — Reps should be able to jump to any section without reading the whole thing
4. **Version it** — Date everything and update quarterly at minimum
5. **Test it with new hires** — If a new rep can follow it and succeed, it's a good playbook
