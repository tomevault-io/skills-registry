description: Generate customized sales proposals, business cases, and executive summaries tailored to the prospect's situation. Use this skill whenever a rep needs to create a proposal, write a business case, build an executive summary for a deal, draft a commercial proposal, or says "write a proposal for [company]", "help me build a business case", "I need a proposal document", or "create an executive summary for this deal".

# Proposal Builder

Create compelling, customized proposals that speak directly to the prospect's situation, pain points, and desired outcomes. A great proposal isn't a product brochure — it's a mirror that shows the prospect their own problems and a clear path to solving them.

## Philosophy

The best proposals follow this structure: "Here's what you told us is broken → Here's what it's costing you → Here's how we fix it → Here's what success looks like → Here's the investment." Every section connects back to what the prospect said during discovery.

## Getting Started

- "Write a proposal for [Company] — here's what I know..."
- "Build a business case for the VP of Finance at [Company]"
- "Create an executive summary for this deal"
- "Help me outline a mutual action plan"
- "Draft an SOW for our [product] implementation"

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 0: Automatic Data Pull (Before Asking the User Anything)

**CRITICAL:** Before asking for deal context, pull everything from connected tools. The best proposals are grounded in real deal data and the prospect's own words from discovery.

#### CRM Data Pull

Check if you have access to CRM tools (look for tools containing `search_crm_objects`, `get_crm_objects`, or similar).

If CRM tools ARE available:

1. **Find the deal.** Search `deals` for the company/deal name the user mentioned.
   - Properties: `dealname`, `amount`, `dealstage`, `closedate`, `createdate`, `pipeline`, `hubspot_owner_id`, `dealtype`, `description`, `notes_last_contacted`, `num_notes`
2. **Pull contacts.** Get associated contacts for the deal.
   - Properties: `firstname`, `lastname`, `jobtitle`, `email`, `phone`, `company`, `lifecyclestage`
   - Map roles: Who is the champion? Economic buyer? Technical evaluator? Who will read this proposal?
3. **Pull company.** Get associated company data.
   - Properties: `name`, `domain`, `industry`, `numberofemployees`, `annualrevenue`, `description`, `about_us`, `founded_year`, `country`
   - Use this for the "Understanding Your Situation" section
4. **Pull deal notes.** If notes exist, extract discovery context, pain points, and decision criteria.

#### Sales Intelligence Data Pull

**ZoomInfo** (if available):
1. **Research the company.** Use `zoominfo_search_company` with the prospect company name/domain.
   - Revenue, funding, employee count, industry — feeds the "Understanding Your Situation" section
2. **Get tech stack.** Use `zoominfo_get_tech_stack` for the prospect company.
   - Current tools → feeds competitive positioning and integration sections

**Clay** (if available):
1. **Enrich the company.** Use `clay_enrich_company` with the prospect company domain.
   - Additional company context, signals, and enrichment data

**LinkedIn** (if available):
1. **Get prospect profiles.** Use `linkedin_get_profile` for key stakeholders who will read the proposal.
   - Titles, tenure, background — personalize the proposal for each reader
2. **Search company updates.** Use `linkedin_search_companies` for recent company news.
   - Recent events, initiatives, and strategic moves to reference in the proposal

#### Gong Data Pull

Check if you have access to Gong tools (look for tools prefixed with `gong_`).

If Gong tools ARE available:

1. **Find discovery calls.** Use `gong_search_calls` with the company name and deal date range.
2. **Pull transcripts.** Use `gong_get_transcript` on discovery and demo calls.
   - Extract: prospect's own words about pain points, goals, and desired outcomes
   - Extract: specific metrics, costs, and numbers the prospect mentioned
   - Extract: decision criteria discussed
   - Extract: objections or concerns raised
3. **Use prospect quotes directly** in the proposal — nothing is more powerful than their own words reflected back.

#### Calendar/Email Data Pull

If calendar/email tools are available (`outlook_calendar_search`, `outlook_email_search`):
1. Search email history with the prospect for shared materials, requirements, or follow-up notes
2. Check for any RFP or evaluation criteria documents exchanged

#### Chat Data Pull

If chat tools are available (`slack_search_public`, `slack_search_public_and_private`):
1. Search for the deal/company name in sales channels
2. Surface internal insights about competitive situation, pricing discussions, or stakeholder dynamics

#### Present What You Found

> "I pulled deal context for **[Company]**: a **$[X] deal** in **[Stage]** stage. Per CRM, the key contacts are **[Name, Title]** and **[Name, Title]**. Per ZoomInfo, they're a **[industry]** company with **[N] employees** and **$[X]M revenue**. [If Gong:] I found **[N] call transcripts** — key pain points include [topics]. Building your proposal now..."

### Step 1: Gather Remaining Context

After the auto-pull, ask ONLY for what the tools couldn't provide:
- **Pricing structure** — If not in CRM deal data
- **Specific solution components** — What exactly are you proposing?
- **Document type preference** — Full proposal, executive summary, business case, or MAP?
- **Qualitative context** — Anything not captured in CRM/Gong (personal dynamics, unofficial concerns)

### Step 2: Generate the Proposal

Build using ALL evidence. Cite sources when referencing data: "Per CRM:", "Per Gong:", "Per ZoomInfo:", "Per LinkedIn:". Use prospect quotes from Gong transcripts throughout.

### Step 3: Store Insights

- Update `memory/deal-patterns.md` with proposal themes that resonate
- Log the proposal in `memory/changelog.md`

## What I Need From You (When Tools Aren't Connected)

The quality of the proposal is directly proportional to the discovery context you provide:

**Must have:**
1. **Company name and context** — Who they are and what they do
2. **The problem** — What's broken, in their words if possible
3. **Your solution** — What you're proposing and why it fits
4. **Key stakeholders** — Who will read this, what they care about
5. **Pricing** — Investment amount and structure

**Makes it much better:**
- Discovery call notes or transcript
- Their stated decision criteria
- Competitor they're evaluating
- Timeline and urgency drivers
- Specific ROI metrics or goals they mentioned
- Their current solution/process and its shortcomings

[One or two short examples of similar customers and their results]

---

## Next Steps

1. [Specific action with date]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action]

---

## Appendix (if needed)

```

---

## Document Variations

### Executive Summary (1-2 pages)
For senior stakeholders who won't read the full proposal. Hits: problem, solution, outcomes, investment, next steps. Everything in one or two pages.

### Business Case
ROI-focused document for financial stakeholders. Heavy on metrics, cost analysis, payback period, and risk mitigation. Less about the product, more about the investment thesis.

### Mutual Action Plan
Shared document between you and the prospect outlining every step from now to close. Includes owners, dates, and dependencies. Creates accountability on both sides.

### SOW Outline
Implementation-focused document with scope, deliverables, timeline, responsibilities, and acceptance criteria. Used when the prospect is ready to move forward and needs the "how."

---

## Personalization Rules

The proposal should feel like it was written specifically for this prospect because it was:

1. **Use their company name** throughout — not generic "the customer"
2. **Quote their words** — reference specific things they said in discovery
3. **Match their priorities** — lead with what matters most to them
4. **Address their concerns** — proactively respond to known objections
5. **Speak their language** — match industry terminology and tone
