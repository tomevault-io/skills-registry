1. Check if `.github/dependabot.yml` already exists in the project.
2. If `.github/dependabot.yml` does not already exist, create it.
   - For your reference, here is a minimal dependabot.yml file that monitors npm dependencies daily:
   ```yaml
   version: 2
   updates:
   - package-ecosystem: "npm"
      directory: "/"
      schedule:
         interval: "daily"
   ```
3. Populate `.github/dependabot.yml` with the correct configuration for the project's dependencies. Here is a common use cases you will encounter (but this is listed just as an example, it is not exhaustive so refer to the "Additonal resources" if other dependencies are in scope):
   - Search the root of the project, and all subdirectories recursively, for `package.json` files. For each `package.json` file found, add an entry for `npm` dependencies in the `.github/dependabot.yml` file with the correct directory path to the `package.json` file. For example, if a `package.json` file is found in the root of the project, in a `client` directory, and in a `cdk` directory, the dependabot.yml file should have 3 entries for npm dependencies with the correct directory paths:

   ```yaml
   updates:
     - package-ecosystem: 'npm'
       directory: '/'
       schedule:
         interval: 'daily'
     - package-ecosystem: 'npm'
       directory: '/cdk'
       schedule:
         interval: 'daily'
     - package-ecosystem: 'npm'
       directory: '/client'
       schedule:
         interval: 'daily'
   ```

   - As of 02/08/2026, the full list of languages/technologies supported are: Bazel, Bundler, Bun, Cargo, Composer, Devcontainers, Docker, Docker Compose, Dotnet SDK, Elm, GitHub Actions, Gitsubmodule, Gomod (Go Modules), Gradle, Helm, Hex (Hex), Julia, Maven, NPM and Yarn, NuGet, OpenTofu, Pip, Pub, Swift, Terraform, UV. But you should always double check the "Additional resources" link below via WebSearch for the most up to date list of supported languages and technologies. Do not skip the WebSearch when confirming this.

4. Explain to the user why you chose the specific `directory` path for each entry in the dependabot.yml file and give links to specific documentation if available to further help them understand it's truly correct.
