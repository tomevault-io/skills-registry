# Context Optimization for Claude Code

## Overview

Claude Code sessions have a finite context window. Understanding what consumes context and how to minimize waste keeps sessions productive longer. This skill provides patterns and strategies for context-efficient workflows.

## What Consumes Context

Every interaction in a Claude Code session adds to context. The main consumers, ranked by typical impact:

### 1. Message Metadata Overhead (30-40%)
Every message carries a JSON envelope with sessionId, uuid, cwd, gitBranch, version, and other fields. This is not directly controllable but is the largest single category.

### 2. Progress/Streaming Messages (20-30%)
Hook progress events and streaming data accumulate significantly in long sessions. Not directly controllable.

### 3. User-Pasted Images (10-20%)
Screenshots pasted into chat are encoded as base64 PNG, inflating size ~33% over raw bytes. A single full-screen PNG screenshot can consume 500 KB to 2 MB of context.

### 4. File Read Results (5-10%)
Every `Read` tool invocation returns the full file content into context. Re-reading the same file multiple times multiplies its impact.

### 5. Browser Screenshots (3-5%)
Claude-in-Chrome screenshots are JPEG (~50-80 KB each) but accumulate in browser-heavy sessions.

### 6. Edit/Write Payloads (2-3%)
File content included in Edit and Write operations.

### 7. Bash Output (1-3%)
Command output returned to context. Usually small per-call but adds up with heavy Bash usage.

## Optimization Strategies

### Compress Screenshots Before Pasting
- Resize to ~800px wide before pasting
- Use JPEG format instead of PNG where possible
- Consider using Claude-in-Chrome's screenshot tool (produces ~50-70 KB JPEG) instead of pasting full-screen PNGs (500 KB-2 MB)
- On macOS, use Preview or a keyboard shortcut to downscale clipboard images

### Reduce File Re-Reads
- Add structural summaries of frequently-referenced files to the project's `CLAUDE.md`
- For infrastructure files (CloudFormation, Terraform, etc.), document resource names and relationships in `CLAUDE.md`
- Keep documentation files (DEVLOG.md, CHANGELOG.md) concise; archive old content

### Use /compact Proactively
- Run `/compact` after browser automation sequences with many screenshots
- Run `/compact` after completing a distinct phase of work
- Run `/compact` when switching between different parts of the codebase

### Optimize Bash Usage
- Pipe verbose output through `head` or `tail` when full output is unnecessary
- Redirect large outputs to files and read selectively
- Use `--quiet` or `--silent` flags where available

### Use .claudeignore
- Add build artifacts, node_modules, and generated files
- Add large data files that should not be searched
- Add log files and temporary outputs

### Prefer Edit Over Write
- `Edit` replaces specific strings (small payload)
- `Write` sends the entire file content (large payload)
- For modifications to existing files, Edit is more context-efficient

### Consolidate Subagent Usage
- Each Task/subagent invocation adds its result to context
- Combine related queries into a single subagent call when possible
- Use targeted prompts that return concise results

## Diagnosing Context Issues

To analyze what's consuming context in a specific project, run:

```
/context-analyzer:analyze-context
```

This parses the project's JSONL chat history files in `~/.claude/projects/` and produces a detailed breakdown with per-category sizes, most re-read files, and targeted recommendations.

For programmatic access, the analysis script supports JSON output:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/analyze_context.py --json
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Re-Reading the Same File Every Turn
**Problem**: Claude reads `types.ts` or `api.ts` every time it needs to reference types.
**Fix**: Add key type definitions or API surface to `CLAUDE.md`.

### Pasting Full-Screen Screenshots
**Problem**: Each PNG screenshot is 500 KB-2 MB in base64.
**Fix**: Crop to the relevant area and resize before pasting.

### Long Browser Automation Sequences Without Compacting
**Problem**: 20+ screenshots from scroll-screenshot-click sequences fill context.
**Fix**: Run `/compact` after browser testing. Use `read_page` (accessibility tree) instead of screenshots when visual verification isn't needed.

### Verbose Build/Test Output
**Problem**: Full test suite output or build logs dumped to context.
**Fix**: Pipe through `tail -20` or grep for failures only.

### Large Documentation Files Read on Every Session
**Problem**: DEVLOG.md or similar grows over time and is read at session start.
**Fix**: Keep it under 5 KB or move to Claude Code memory (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`).
