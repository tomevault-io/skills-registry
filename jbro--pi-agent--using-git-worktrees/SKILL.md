# Using Git Worktrees

## Overview

Git worktrees create isolated workspaces sharing the same repository, allowing work on multiple
branches simultaneously without switching.

**Core principle:** Systematic directory selection + safety verification = reliable isolation.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace."

## Directory Selection Process

Follow this priority order:

### 1. Check Existing Directories

```bash
ls -d .worktrees 2>/dev/null     # Preferred (hidden)
ls -d worktrees 2>/dev/null      # Alternative
```

If found: use it. If both exist, `.worktrees` wins.

### 2. Check AGENTS.md

```bash
grep -i "worktree.*director" AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null
```

If preference specified: use it without asking.

### 3. Ask User

```
No worktree directory found. Where should I create worktrees?

1. .worktrees/ (project-local, hidden)
2. ~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/<project-name>/ (global location)

Which would you prefer?
```

## Safety Verification

### For Project-Local Directories

**MUST verify before creating worktree:**

```bash
git check-ignore -q .worktrees 2>/dev/null || git check-ignore -q worktrees 2>/dev/null
```

**If NOT ignored:** add to `.gitignore`, commit, then proceed.
This prevents accidentally committing worktree contents to the repository.

### For Global Directory (`~/.config/superpowers/worktrees`)

No `.gitignore` verification needed — outside the project entirely.

## Creation Steps

### 1. Detect Project Name

```bash
project=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
```

### 2. Create Worktree

```bash
git worktree add "$path" -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
cd "$path"
```

### 3. Run Project Setup

```bash
if [ -f package.json ]; then npm install; fi
if [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then cargo build; fi
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
if [ -f pyproject.toml ]; then poetry install; fi
if [ -f go.mod ]; then go mod download; fi
```

### 4. Verify Clean Baseline

```bash
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

If tests fail: report failures, ask whether to proceed or investigate.

### 5. Report Location

```
Worktree ready at <full-path>
Tests passing (<N> tests, 0 failures)
Ready to implement <feature-name>
```

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `.worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| `worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| Both exist | Use `.worktrees/` |
| Neither exists | Check AGENTS.md → ask user |
| Directory not ignored | Add to `.gitignore` + commit |
| Tests fail at baseline | Report + ask before proceeding |
| No package.json / Cargo.toml | Skip dependency install |

## Rules

**Never:**
- Create a project-local worktree without `git check-ignore` verification
- Skip baseline test verification
- Proceed with failing tests without asking
- Assume directory location when ambiguous — always follow the priority order

**Always:**
- Priority: existing directory > AGENTS.md preference > ask user
- Auto-detect project setup from project files
- Verify clean test baseline before reporting ready

## Integration

**Called by:** executing-plans — REQUIRED before executing any tasks

**Pairs with:** finishing-a-development-branch — REQUIRED for cleanup after work is complete
