# Flutter Auto Hot Reload

This skill provides guidance for setting up automatic hot reload in Flutter projects, enabling instant UI updates when code changes without manual intervention.

## Overview

Flutter's hot reload injects updated source code into the running Dart VM, preserving app state while showing changes instantly. By default, terminal-based workflows require manually pressing 'r' after each change. This skill enables automatic hot reload across different development environments.

## Terminal-Based Workflows (Claude Code, vim, etc.)

### Method 1: PID File + File Watcher (Recommended)

Start Flutter with the `--pid-file` flag to enable signal-based hot reload:

```bash
# Start Flutter with PID tracking
flutter run -d chrome --pid-file=/tmp/flutter.pid
flutter run -d iPhone --pid-file=/tmp/flutter.pid
flutter run -d emulator-5554 --pid-file=/tmp/flutter.pid
```

Then use a file watcher to trigger reload on changes:

**Using fswatch (macOS):**
```bash
# Install if needed
brew install fswatch

# Watch lib/ and trigger hot reload on changes
fswatch -o lib/ | xargs -n1 -I{} kill -USR1 $(cat /tmp/flutter.pid)
```

**Using entr (cross-platform):**
```bash
# Install if needed
brew install entr  # macOS
apt install entr   # Linux

# Watch and reload
find lib -name '*.dart' | entr -p kill -USR1 $(cat /tmp/flutter.pid)
```

**Using inotifywait (Linux):**
```bash
while inotifywait -r -e modify lib/; do
  kill -USR1 $(cat /tmp/flutter.pid)
done
```

### Signal Reference

| Signal  | Action       | Use Case                        |
|---------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| SIGUSR1 | Hot Reload   | Dart file changes               |
| SIGUSR2 | Hot Restart  | pubspec.yaml, asset changes     |

### Method 2: flutter_hot_reload Package

Install the CLI wrapper that handles file watching automatically:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutter_hot_reload
```

Run instead of `flutter run`:
```bash
flutter_hot_reload -d chrome
flutter_hot_reload -d iPhone
```

Features:
- Watches `.dart` files automatically
- Hot restarts on `pubspec.yaml` changes
- Works with any editor or terminal
- No IDE plugin required

### Method 3: Web Experimental Hot Reload (Flutter 3.32+)

For web development specifically:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --web-experimental-hot-reload
```

This enables automatic hot reload for web without additional setup.

## Chrome DevTools MCP Integration

When using Chrome DevTools MCP to interact with Flutter web apps, use **web-server mode** instead of `-d chrome` to avoid conflicts.

### The Problem

Running `flutter run -d chrome` opens its own Chrome instance. If you also have Chrome DevTools MCP connected to a separate Chrome viewing the same app, you'll get **GlobalKey conflicts**:

```
A GlobalKey was used multiple times inside one widget's child list.
The offending GlobalKey was: [LabeledGlobalKey<NavigatorState>]
```

This happens because both Chrome instances are running the same Flutter app simultaneously.

### The Solution: Web Server Mode

Start Flutter as a web server without opening a browser:

```bash
# Start Flutter web server only (no browser opens)
flutter run -d web-server --web-port=61060 --pid-file=/tmp/flutter.pid
```

Then navigate your MCP Chrome to the app:
- URL: `http://localhost:61060`

### Hot Reload with Web Server Mode

Hot reload signals still work with web-server mode:

```bash
# Hot reload
kill -USR1 $(cat /tmp/flutter.pid)

# Hot restart
kill -USR2 $(cat /tmp/flutter.pid)
```

After sending the signal, **refresh the MCP Chrome page** to see the changes (the web server recompiles, but the browser needs to reload).

### Quick Setup for MCP

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Flutter web server
flutter run -d web-server --web-port=61060 --pid-file=/tmp/flutter.pid

# Then use Chrome DevTools MCP to navigate to http://localhost:61060
# Hot reload with: kill -USR1 $(cat /tmp/flutter.pid)
```

**Note:** Unlike `-d chrome` mode where hot reload updates instantly, with web-server + MCP you may need to refresh the browser after triggering reload.

## Multi-Device Auto Reload

Run multiple devices simultaneously with auto-reload for all:

```bash
# Terminal 1: iOS Simulator
flutter run -d iPhone --pid-file=/tmp/flutter-ios.pid

# Terminal 2: Android Emulator
flutter run -d emulator-5554 --pid-file=/tmp/flutter-android.pid

# Terminal 3: Chrome
flutter run -d chrome --pid-file=/tmp/flutter-web.pid

# Terminal 4: Watcher (reloads ALL devices)
fswatch -o lib/ | xargs -n1 -I{} sh -c 'kill -USR1 $(cat /tmp/flutter-ios.pid) $(cat /tmp/flutter-android.pid) $(cat /tmp/flutter-web.pid) 2>/dev/null'
```

## VS Code Setup

VS Code with the Flutter extension supports auto hot reload natively:

1. Open Settings (Cmd+,)
2. Search "Flutter Hot Reload On Save"
3. Set to one of:
   - `manual` - Only on manual save (Cmd+S)
   - `all` - On manual save and autosave
   - `allDirty` - When file has unsaved changes
   - `manualDirty` - Manual save only if changes exist

Recommended setting for autosave users:
```json
{
  "dart.flutterHotReloadOnSave": "all"
}
```

## Android Studio / IntelliJ Setup

1. Open **Settings > Tools > Actions on Save**
2. Enable "Save files if IDE is idle for X seconds" (recommend 2 seconds)
3. Open **Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Flutter**
4. Check "Perform hot reload on save"

## Convenience Script

Use the bundled script for easy setup:

```bash
# From skill directory
~/.claude/skills/flutter-auto-reload/scripts/flutter-watch.sh -d chrome
~/.claude/skills/flutter-auto-reload/scripts/flutter-watch.sh -d iPhone
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hot Reload Not Triggering

1. Verify PID file exists: `cat /tmp/flutter.pid`
2. Verify process is running: `ps -p $(cat /tmp/flutter.pid)`
3. Check file watcher is running and watching correct directory
4. Ensure changes are in `lib/` directory (not test/ or other)

### Hot Reload vs Hot Restart

Some changes require hot restart (SIGUSR2) instead of reload:
- Changes to `main()` function
- Changes to global/static variables initialization
- Changes to native code
- Asset changes
- pubspec.yaml changes

### State Not Preserved

Hot reload preserves state, but if state is lost:
- Check for errors in console
- Ensure no syntax errors in changed files
- Try hot restart if reload fails silently

## Quick Reference

| Environment | Command |
|-------------|---------|
| Terminal + fswatch | `fswatch -o lib/ \| xargs -n1 -I{} kill -USR1 $(cat /tmp/flutter.pid)` |
| Terminal + entr | `find lib -name '*.dart' \| entr -p kill -USR1 $(cat /tmp/flutter.pid)` |
| flutter_hot_reload | `flutter_hot_reload -d <device>` |
| Web experimental | `flutter run -d chrome --web-experimental-hot-reload` |
| VS Code | Set `dart.flutterHotReloadOnSave` to `all` |
| Android Studio | Enable in Settings > Flutter > Hot reload on save |
