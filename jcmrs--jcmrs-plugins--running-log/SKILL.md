**Name**: running-log
**Version**: 2.0
**Domain**: Process Memory, Decision Tracking, Cross-Session Learning
**Status**: Redesigned based on Phase 2 validation findings

---

## Purpose

Maintain a persistent, schema-driven running log that captures:
- **Ideas** (human quick-capture backlog)
- **Consultations** (AI-detected external sources)
- **Process Memory** (AI-detected reasoning patterns)

Creates searchable, auto-organized entry backlog across sessions through **three distinct workflows**:
1. Human quick-capture (`/idea`)
2. AI auto-detection (Consultation, Process Memory)
3. Post-processing librarian (`/review-backlog`)

**Critical Design Insight**: Human entry workflows differ fundamentally from AI auto-detection workflows. v2.0 separates these cleanly.

---

## Architecture: Three-Component System

### Component 1: `/idea` Command (Human Territory)

**Purpose**: Ultra-minimal quick capture while working

**Workflow**:
```
User: /idea Local copies of Anthropic docs in AI-optimized format
→ Entry created immediately with defaults
→ User continues work
```

**What AI fills automatically**:
- Entry ID: `#ID-YYYYMMDD-NNN` (auto-incremented)
- Timestamp: ISO 8601
- Confidence/Priority: `TBD` (To Be Determined - evaluated during backlog review)
- Status: `Backlog` (default for all ideas)
- Tags: AI-generated from description + existing tag taxonomy
- Type: `Idea/Note`
- Profile: Active profile (e.g., `DEVELOPER`)

**Entry Schema (Ideas)**:
```markdown
## Idea/Note | #ID-YYYYMMDD-NNN | [ISO 8601 Timestamp]

**Description**: [User-provided 1-line description]
**Confidence/Priority**: TBD
**Status**: Backlog
**Type**: Idea/Note
**Profile**: [Active Profile]
**Tags**: [AI-generated tags]

---
```

**Why this works**:
- Zero friction: User types one line, gets back to work
- No nonsensical prompts for confidence (ideas are captured, not evaluated)
- No status guessing (all ideas start as backlog)
- Consistent tags (AI prevents million inconsistent human tags)
- Evaluation happens later during `/review-backlog`

---

### Component 2: AI Auto-Detection (AI Territory)

**Purpose**: Monitor Claude's responses for reasoning patterns worth capturing

**Entry Types**:

#### Consultation (External Sources)
AI detects when referencing external knowledge:
- Documentation lookups
- Perplexity/research queries
- User-provided references
- Framework/library citations

**Auto-generates**:
```markdown
## Consultation | #ID-YYYYMMDD-NNN | [Timestamp]

**Description**: [What was consulted]
**Source**: [Citation/URL]
**Confidence**: [AI's confidence in source quality: High/Med/Low]
**Status**: Reviewed
**Type**: Consultation
**Profile**: [Active Profile]
**Tags**: [domain, source-type, framework]

---
```

#### Process Memory (AI Reasoning Patterns)
AI detects loggable reasoning patterns in its own responses:

**Pattern 1: Uncertainty**
```regex
/uncertainty\s+(on|about|regarding|around)\s+([^.!?]+)/i
```
→ Logs: What's uncertain, confidence level

**Pattern 2: Assumption**
```regex
/assum(e|ing|ption)\s+(that|about|the)\s+([^.!?]+)/i
```
→ Logs: Assumption made, validation status

**Pattern 3: Confidence Threshold**
```regex
/confidence\s+(less\s+than|below|<)\s*(\d+)%?/i
```
→ Logs: Low-confidence item needing validation

**Pattern 4: Decision/Fork**
```regex
/(fork|branch|decision\s+point|chose|decided|rejected)\s+(in|on)?\s*([^.!?]+)/i
```
→ Logs: Decision made, alternatives considered, rationale

**Pattern 5: Critical Signal**
```regex
/critical|blocker|blocking|must\s+(clarify|understand|verify)/i
```
→ Logs: Critical issue flagged, requires attention

**Auto-generates**:
```markdown
## Process Memory | #ID-YYYYMMDD-NNN | [Timestamp]

**Description**: [Reasoning pattern detected]
**Confidence**: [AI's certainty about this pattern: 0-100%]
**Status**: [Assumed/Validated/Rejected]
**Type**: Process Memory
**Profile**: [Active Profile]
**Tags**: [pattern-type, domain, criticality]
**Pattern Detected**: [Which regex matched]
**Raw Output**: [Exact phrase from Claude's response]

**Extended Context**:
[Why this pattern matters, implications, next steps]

---
```

**Cadence**: 3 automatic checks per session
1. **Session Start**: Continuity from previous session
2. **Mid-Toolchain**: After `floor(tool_count / 3)` tools executed
3. **Session End**: Archive session learnings

**Confidence Thresholds** (Auto-log only if >= threshold):
- DEVELOPER: 75%
- RESEARCHER: 60%
- ENGINEER: 70%
- DEFAULT: 70%

**Noise Filtering**:
1. Confidence threshold (above)
2. Entry cap per session (DEVELOPER: 8, RESEARCHER: 12, ENGINEER: 10)
3. Deduplication (Levenshtein 85% similarity suppresses duplicates)

---

### Component 3: `/review-backlog` Command (Librarian Function)

**Purpose**: Post-process entries to organize, prioritize, and link

**What it does**:
1. **Relationship Identification**: AI analyzes all entries and identifies connections
2. **Tag Refinement**: Harmonizes tags across entries, suggests taxonomy improvements
3. **Prioritization**: Reviews `TBD` priorities, suggests High/Med/Low based on context
4. **Linking**: Populates `Linked To` field by finding related entries
5. **Auto-Section Generation**: Regenerates High-Priority Ideas, Open Risks, Linked Insights

**Usage**:
```
/review-backlog                 # Review all entries, suggest actions
/review-backlog --ideas         # Review only ideas (prioritize, link)
/review-backlog --risks         # Review low-confidence items
/review-backlog --link #ID-001  # Find and link entries related to #ID-001
```

**Example Output**:
```
🔍 Backlog Review Results

Ideas Requiring Prioritization (5):
- #ID-20251222-001: Local AI-optimized docs → Suggested: High (aligns with knowledge-base work)
- #ID-20251221-003: Plugin permission system → Suggested: Med (dependent on architecture)

Suggested Links (3):
- #ID-20251222-001 ← #ID-20251221-008 (both reference documentation workflows)
- #ID-20251221-005 → #ID-20251221-003 (decision impacts idea)

Tag Harmonization:
- Rename "docs" → "documentation" (4 entries)
- Merge "anthropic-api" + "anthropic" (2 entries)

Apply changes? [Y/n]
```

**Why separate from capture**:
- Humans can't know relationships while capturing ideas mid-work
- Requires full-backlog context to identify patterns
- Deliberate activity, not real-time capture
- AI analyzes relationships humans can't see

## Migration from v1.0

**Changes**:
1. **`/log` command removed** → Use `/idea [description]` instead
2. **Interactive prompting removed** → `/idea` is one-line only
3. **Confidence/Status for ideas** → Now defaults (TBD/Backlog)
4. **Tags** → AI-generated, not human-entered
5. **Linked To** → Post-processing via `/review-backlog`, not capture-time
6. **`/review` command** → Renamed to `/review-backlog` with expanded functions

**Existing logs compatible**: v1.0 entries remain valid, new entries use v2.0 schema

---

## Design Rationale (Phase 2 Learnings)

### Problem 1: Nonsensical Fields for Ideas
**v1.0**: Asked humans for confidence/priority when capturing ideas
**Issue**: Ideas are captured for later evaluation, not evaluated at capture time
**v2.0 Fix**: Defaults to TBD/Backlog, evaluation happens during `/review-backlog`

### Problem 2: Inconsistent Human Tags
**v1.0**: Asked humans to enter free-form tags
**Issue**: Million inconsistent tags, none relevant
**v2.0 Fix**: AI auto-generates tags from description + existing taxonomy

### Problem 3: Impossible "Linked To" Field
**v1.0**: Asked humans to provide entry IDs while capturing
**Issue**: Humans don't memorize IDs mid-work
**v2.0 Fix**: AI identifies relationships during `/review-backlog` post-processing

### Problem 4: Monolithic Command
**v1.0**: Single `/log` command tried to handle all entry types
**Issue**: Human quick-capture ≠ AI auto-detection workflows
**v2.0 Fix**: Split into `/idea` (human), auto-detection (AI), `/review-backlog` (librarian)

---

## Version & Maintenance

**Current**: v2.0 (Redesigned based on Phase 2 validation)
**Previous**: v1.0 (Phase 1 spec-only)

**Expected Updates**:
- v2.1: Post-deployment tuning based on real usage
- v3.0: Multi-repository support, cross-project insights

**Schema Stability**: Core schema stable. Thresholds may adjust based on empirical data.

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement `/idea` command (minimal quick-capture)
2. Implement `/review-backlog` command (librarian functions)
3. Update existing `/running-log` command for display-only modes
4. Test with real workflows across 5+ sessions
5. Collect usage data, tune thresholds

---

**End of SKILL.md Specification v2.0**

*This specification reflects critical design learnings from Phase 2 validation. The three-component architecture (quick-capture, auto-detection, post-processing) separates human and AI workflows appropriately.*
