name: semantic-translation
description: This skill should be used when the user uses ambiguous terminology like "make it talk", "we need an api", "make it portable", "check for gaps", asks meta-questions like "am I making sense?", "does this make sense?", mentions being a "non-technical user", uses vague action verbs ("make it work", "do the thing"), mixes domain languages, uses invented terms, or when detecting semantic drift between human natural language and technical precision. Provides semantic translation, disambiguation, and domain knowledge mapping across Autogen, Langroid, MCP (Model Context Protocol), UTCP (Universal Tool Calling Protocol), FastAPI, Git/Gitflow, SRE (Site Reliability Engineering), and Memory Graphs domains. Bridges the gap between user intent and technical specificity through ontological translation. Use when this capability is needed.

# Semantic Translation & Ontological Mapping

## Purpose

Prevent miscommunication, assumptions, and hallucinations by translating ambiguous user terminology into precise technical concepts across multiple domains. Act as a semantic bridge between human natural language and technical specificity, mapping concepts across Autogen, Langroid, MCP, UTCP, FastAPI, Git/Gitflow, SRE, and Memory Graphs ecosystems.

## Supported Domains

This skill provides semantic translation and disambiguation across 8 technical domains:

1. **Autogen** - Multi-agent orchestration (ConversableAgent, AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, GroupChat)
2. **Langroid** - Agent framework (ChatAgent, ToolAgent, Task orchestration)
3. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - Server types (SSE, stdio, HTTP, WebSocket), tools, resources, prompts, sampling
4. **UTCP (Universal Tool Calling Protocol)** - Framework-agnostic tool schemas, adapters, universal tool definitions
5. **FastAPI** - Python web framework (path operations, dependency injection with Depends(), Pydantic models, APIRouter)
6. **Git/Gitflow** - Version control workflows (feature/release/hotfix branches, merge strategies, collaboration patterns)
7. **SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)** - Observability pillars (logs/metrics/traces), SLO/SLI/SLA, incident management
8. **Memory Graphs** - Knowledge graph structures (entities, relationships, embeddings, episodic/semantic/procedural memory)

## The Core Problem

Users frequently encounter the "abyss" between natural language intent and technical precision:

- **Vague terminology**: "make it talk", "we need an api", "make it work"
- **Unclear scope**: "check for gaps", "make it portable"
- **Meta-questions**: "am I making sense?", "does this make sense?"
- **Domain confusion**: Mixing business and technical terminology
- **Invented terms**: User-created words not in domain vocabulary

Without intervention, these ambiguities lead to:
- AI assumptions and hallucinations
- Misaligned implementations
- Wasted development time
- Project failures from misunderstood requirements

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger semantic validation when detecting:

1. **Ambiguous Action Verbs**
   - "make it [X]" → Multiple technical interpretations possible
   - "do the thing" → No clear referent
   - "fix it" → Unclear what or how

2. **Meta-Questions (User Seeking Validation)**
   - "am I making sense?" → User uncertain about their explanation
   - "does this make sense?" → User seeking confirmation
   - "is this right?" → User wants validation
   - "non-technical user" → User self-identifies as potentially ambiguous

3. **Domain-Crossing Language**
   - Mixing business and technical terms
   - Unclear which framework/library intended
   - Generic terms with multiple technical meanings

4. **Unclear References**
   - "that", "the previous thing", "like before"
   - References without clear antecedents

5. **Scope Ambiguity**
   - "portable" → Docker? Cross-platform? Vendoring? Executable?
   - "api" → HTTP server? API client? API design? Internal interface?
   - "gaps" → Code coverage? Documentation? Features? Security?

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Ambiguity

Analyze the user's message for ambiguity signals. Use pattern matching from `scripts/detect-ambiguity.py` or manual analysis.

**High-confidence triggers (always validate):**
- Explicit meta-questions: "am I making sense?"
- Vague action verbs with unclear objects: "make it talk"
- Domain confusion: mixing incompatible terminology
- User self-identification: "I'm a non-technical user"

**Moderate-confidence triggers (validate if >80% confidence):**
- Generic technical terms: "api", "agent", "portable"
- Unclear scope: "check for gaps", "add validation"
- Invented terminology: words not in domain vocabulary

### Step 2: Query Knowledge Sources (In Order)

Query knowledge sources in this specific order for efficiency:

**1. Static Domain Knowledge (First - Fastest)**
- Query `knowledge/ambiguous-terms.json` for known ambiguous phrases
- Check `knowledge/technical-mappings.json` for domain-specific translations
- Review `knowledge/ontology-graph.json` for conceptual relationships

**2. External Documentation (Second - Authoritative)**
- Query official documentation (Autogen, Langroid, etc.) via available tools
- Use WebFetch, context7, or deepwiki MCP for current API references
- Validate against authoritative sources when static knowledge insufficient

**3. Codebase Validation (Third - Context-Specific)**
- Use LSP to query symbol definitions in user's project
- Use Grep to search for actual usage patterns
- Identify project-specific terminology and conventions

### Step 3: Translate Ambiguous → Precise

Map ambiguous terminology to precise technical concepts using domain knowledge.

**Translation process:**
1. Identify all possible technical interpretations
2. Rank by confidence score (from knowledge files)
3. Consider user's context (recent conversation, project domain)
4. Present options if multiple interpretations viable

**Example translation:**
```
Ambiguous: "make it talk"
Domain: Autogen
Possible translations:
- ConversableAgent.send() (confidence: 0.8, context: single message)
- register ConversableAgent (confidence: 0.7, context: enable conversation)
- GroupChat setup (confidence: 0.5, context: multi-agent conversation)
```

### Step 4: Engage Conversational Clarification

**Never assume.** Always verify understanding with the user.

Present options conversationally:
```
I notice "[ambiguous term]" could mean different things:

1. [Precise interpretation 1] - [Brief context]
2. [Precise interpretation 2] - [Brief context]
3. [Precise interpretation 3] - [Brief context]

[Ask clarifying question based on context]
```

**Tone guidelines:**
- Conversational, not clinical
- Helpful, not pedantic
- Transparent about uncertainty
- Frame as collaboration, not correction

**Wait for confirmation** before proceeding with implementation.

2. Ask explicitly: "Which framework/library are you using?"
3. Once identified, load domain-specific knowledge
4. Translate with domain context

## Confidence Scoring

Use confidence scores to determine intervention:

**High confidence (>80%):** Always validate
- Explicit meta-questions
- Known highly ambiguous terms (from knowledge files)
- Domain confusion detected
- User self-identifies ambiguity

**Medium confidence (50-80%):** Validate if multiple interpretations
- Generic technical terms with context clues
- Unclear scope with partial context
- Vague references with some antecedents

**Low confidence (<50%):** Monitor but don't interrupt
- Technical terms with clear context
- Conventional usage patterns
- Recent clarification provided

## Integration with Knowledge Files

### ambiguous-terms.json

Contains user phrases mapped to ambiguity scores and contexts.

**Query pattern:**
```python
term = extract_key_phrase(user_message)
entry = load_json("knowledge/ambiguous-terms.json").get(term)
if entry and entry["ambiguity_score"] > 0.8:
    trigger_validation(term, entry["contexts"])
```

### technical-mappings.json

Contains precise technical translations organized by domain.

**Query pattern:**
```python
mappings = load_json("knowledge/technical-mappings.json")
domain_mappings = mappings.get(domain, {})
translations = domain_mappings.get(ambiguous_term, [])
present_options(translations)
```

### ontology-graph.json

Contains conceptual relationships between terms across domains.

**Query pattern:**
```python
graph = load_json("knowledge/ontology-graph.json")
related_concepts = graph.get(concept, {}).get("related", [])
cross_domain = graph.get(concept, {}).get("cross_domain_equivalents", {})
```

## Best Practices

### Always Verify, Never Assume

"Never ASSUME - it makes an ass out of u and me."

- Present options when ambiguity detected
- Ask clarifying questions before proceeding
- Confirm understanding with user
- Never proceed with interpretation alone

### Maintain Conversational Tone

- Avoid clinical language: "Ambiguity detected at 87% confidence"
- Use helpful framing: "I notice [term] could mean a few different things..."
- Frame as collaboration: "Let me make sure I understand..."
- Be transparent about uncertainty

### Respect User Triggers

Users have different patterns for expressing uncertainty. Learn from settings:
- Default triggers: "am I making sense?", "does this make sense?"
- Custom triggers from `.claude/semantic-linguist.local.md`
- Adapt to user's communication style

### Progressive Validation

Not every message needs validation:
- Start with high-confidence triggers only
- Expand to moderate-confidence as needed
- Don't interrupt clear, unambiguous requests
- Balance helpfulness with intrusiveness

## Configuration

Users can customize via `.claude/semantic-linguist.local.md`:

- **Sensitivity**: low, medium (default), high
- **Interaction style**: explicit (default), guided, silent
- **User trigger phrases**: Custom patterns to trigger validation
- **Custom terminology mappings**: Project-specific translations
- **Enabled domains**: Which domains to validate against

Respect user configuration when determining whether to trigger validation.

---

**Core principle**: Bridge the gap between human natural language and AI technical precision through systematic semantic validation and conversational clarification.
