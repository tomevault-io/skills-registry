# Skill: TODO.md Manager

## Description

Manages project TODO.md files with structured sections for task tracking. Handles adding tasks, nesting sub-tasks under existing items, and summarizing completed work.

## Instructions

### 1. Locate or Create TODO.md

**Search order:**
1. `./TODO.md` (project root)
2. `./docs/TODO.md`

**If neither exists:** Create `docs/TODO.md` with this template:

```markdown
# TODO

## In Progress

## Up Next

## Backlog

## Done
```

### 2. Task Format

**Main tasks:**
```markdown
- [ ] Task description
```

**With priority (optional):**
```markdown
- [ ] [HIGH] Fix critical auth bug
- [ ] [MED] Add user settings page
- [ ] [LOW] Update footer styling
```

**Sub-tasks (indented with 2 spaces):**
```markdown
- [ ] Implement auth flow
  - [ ] Add login endpoint
  - [ ] Add logout endpoint
  - [ ] Write tests
```

### 3. Adding New Tasks

**Workflow:**

1. **Check existing items** in the target section (usually Up Next or Backlog)
2. **Look for related tasks** the new item might belong under
3. **If clearly related:** Add as indented sub-task
4. **If ambiguous:** Ask the user: "Should this go under '[existing task]' or as a new item?"
5. **If unrelated:** Add as new top-level item

**Context clues for sub-task detection:**
- New task mentions same feature/component as existing task
- New task is a step toward completing an existing task
- Keywords overlap significantly (e.g., "auth", "login", "user")

**Example:**
```
Existing: - [ ] Implement auth flow
New task: "add password reset endpoint"

→ Clearly related, add as sub-task:
- [ ] Implement auth flow
  - [ ] Add password reset endpoint
```

### 4. Proactive Suggestions

**When to suggest tasks:**

If you notice high-priority issues while working (critical bugs, missing error handling, security concerns, broken tests), you can prompt the user:

"I noticed [issue]. Should I add '[suggested task]' to the TODO list?"

**Only suggest when:**
- Issue is genuinely important (HIGH priority level)
- It's clear the user hasn't already addressed it
- You're actively working in related code

**Don't spam suggestions:**
- Limit to 1-2 per session unless user asks for more
- Skip minor improvements or style issues
- Focus on functionality, security, or blocking problems

### 5. Moving Tasks Between Sections

**In Progress → Done:**
1. Summarize the task to a single line (drop sub-task checklists)
2. Add brief parenthetical if sub-tasks provide useful context
3. Mark as checked
4. **Insert at the top of Done section** (newest first)
5. Remove from In Progress

**Example transformation:**
```markdown
# Before (In Progress):
- [ ] Implement auth flow
  - [x] Add login endpoint
  - [x] Add logout endpoint
  - [x] Add password reset
  - [x] Write tests for auth

# After (Done):
- [x] Implement auth flow (login, logout, password reset)
```

**Other moves:**
- Up Next → In Progress: Move as-is (preserve sub-tasks and their checked state)
- Backlog → Up Next: Move as-is
- Any section → Backlog: Move as-is (demoting)

### 6. Section Order

Maintain this order in the file:

1. `## In Progress` - Currently being worked on
2. `## Up Next` - Queued for immediate attention
3. `## Backlog` - Future work, not prioritized
4. `## Done` - Completed work (summaries only, newest first)

### 7. Priority Markers

Use when specified by user or when task urgency is mentioned:

| Priority | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| `[HIGH]` | Blocking issues, critical bugs, urgent deadlines |
| `[MED]` | Important but not urgent, normal feature work |
| `[LOW]` | Nice-to-have, minor improvements, tech debt |

**Don't add priority** if the user doesn't mention urgency—keep it simple.

### 8. Error Handling

**Item not found when moving/updating:**
- Search all sections for similar text
- Suggest closest matches: "I couldn't find 'auth flow'. Did you mean 'Implement authentication'?"
- If no matches, ask user to clarify

**Item appears in multiple sections:**
- Warn user: "Found 'auth flow' in both In Progress and Up Next. Which one should I update?"
- Wait for clarification before making changes

**Ambiguous sub-task placement:**
- Ask: "Should 'add login endpoint' go under 'Implement auth flow' or as a new item?"
- Default to asking rather than guessing wrong

### 9. Common Operations

**"Add a task" / "Create todo" / "Update todo with X":**
1. Determine section (default: Up Next, or ask)
2. Check for related existing tasks
3. Add as sub-task or new item

**"Mark X as done" / "Complete X":**
1. Find item in In Progress (or other sections)
2. Summarize if it has sub-tasks
3. Move to top of Done as checked item

**"What's in progress?" / "Show me the todo":**
1. Read and display requested section(s)

**"Move X to in progress" / "Start working on X":**
1. Find item in Up Next or Backlog
2. Move to In Progress section

**"Add sub-task to X":**
1. Find parent task X
2. Add indented checkbox under it

## Examples

### Example 1: Adding a Related Task

**User:** "Add a task to write tests for the login endpoint"

**Current TODO.md:**
```markdown
## In Progress
- [ ] Implement auth flow
  - [x] Add login endpoint
  - [ ] Add logout endpoint
```

**Action:** Recognize "login endpoint" relates to "Implement auth flow"

**Result:**
```markdown
## In Progress
- [ ] Implement auth flow
  - [x] Add login endpoint
  - [ ] Add logout endpoint
  - [ ] Write tests for login endpoint
```

### Example 2: Completing a Task with Sub-tasks

**User:** "Mark auth flow as done"

**Current:**
```markdown
## In Progress
- [ ] Implement auth flow
  - [x] Add login endpoint
  - [x] Add logout endpoint
  - [x] Add password reset

## Done
- [x] Update database schema
```

**Result:**
```markdown
## In Progress

## Done
- [x] Implement auth flow (login, logout, password reset)
- [x] Update database schema
```

### Example 3: Ambiguous Task Placement

**User:** "Add task: update API documentation"

**Current:**
```markdown
## Up Next
- [ ] Refactor API endpoints
- [ ] Write user guide
```

**Response:** "Should 'update API documentation' go under 'Refactor API endpoints', under 'Write user guide', or as a new item?"

### Example 4: Item Not Found

**User:** "Mark authentication as done"

**Current TODO.md has:** `- [ ] Implement auth flow`

**Response:** "I couldn't find 'authentication'. Did you mean 'Implement auth flow'?"

### Example 5: Proactive Suggestion

**Context:** You just fixed a critical bug in the auth code and notice error logging is missing.

**Prompt:** "I noticed the auth endpoints don't have error logging. Should I add '[HIGH] Add error logging to auth endpoints' to the TODO list?"

**User response determines action.**

## Notes

- Done section grows over time (newest at top)—user can manually archive if needed
- Sub-task details are for In Progress/Up Next; Done is the summary view
- When in doubt, ask rather than assume
- Priority markers are optional—only add when user indicates urgency
- When moving tasks between sections, preserve sub-task checkbox states
