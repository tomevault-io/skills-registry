# Context Manager

Skill for managing context window and token usage in Claude Code sessions.

## Overview

Claude Code has a context budget of approximately **190,000 tokens**. This skill helps manage this budget effectively through:
- Token usage analysis and monitoring
- Context-efficient query patterns
- Strategic file loading
- Optimization strategies for large codebases

## Quick Start

### Analyze Current Token Usage

Run the token analysis script to understand context usage:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_tokens.py .
```

This provides:
- Total token count estimation
- Budget usage percentage
- Largest files by token count
- Optimization recommendations

### For Specific Directories or Files

```bash
python scripts/analyze_tokens.py /path/to/directory
python scripts/analyze_tokens.py src/large_file.py
python scripts/analyze_tokens.py . --budget 190000
```

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Starting work on a large codebase (>50 files)
- Noticing performance degradation or incomplete responses
- Planning context-heavy operations (multi-file refactoring)
- Setting up a new project for optimal Claude Code usage
- Claude mentions being near context limits

## Core Principles

### 1. Load Only What's Needed

**DO:**
- Request specific files by name
- Use line ranges for large files: `view(path, [start, end])`
- Load files sequentially for related changes
- Work on one module/component at a time

**DON'T:**
- Load entire directories without filtering
- Keep unnecessary files in context
- Load the same file multiple times
- Request vague "show me everything" queries

### 2. Use Targeted Queries

**Good queries:**
```
"Update the timeout value in config.py line 45 to 30 seconds"
"Show me the login function in auth.py"
"Fix the validation bug in user.py lines 120-135"
```

**Poor queries:**
```
"Help me with this project"
"Load all the code"
"Show me everything related to authentication"
```

### 3. Monitor and Optimize

File size guidelines:
- **Small (<1K tokens)**: Load freely
- **Medium (1-5K tokens)**: Load when needed
- **Large (5-20K tokens)**: Use line ranges
- **Very large (>20K tokens)**: Split or load sections only

Budget zones:
- **Green (<70%)**: Normal operation
- **Yellow (70-85%)**: Be selective
- **Red (>85%)**: Load essentials only, consider reset

## Progressive File Loading

Follow this pattern for efficient context usage:

```
1. Structure → "Show me the project structure"
2. Module → "Show me files in the auth module"  
3. Load → "Load auth.py"
4. Target → "Show me lines 100-150 where the login logic is"
5. Action → "Update line 120 to add validation"
```

## Working with Large Files

### Strategy 1: Line Ranges

Instead of loading entire files:

```python
# Load only relevant section
view("src/api.py", view_range=[100, 200])
view("src/models.py", view_range=[1, 50])
```

### Strategy 2: Progressive Disclosure

```
1. "What functions are in auth.py?"
2. "Show me just the validate_token function"
3. "Now show me where it's called"
```

### Strategy 3: Targeted Modifications

```python
# Precise changes without loading full file
str_replace(
    "Update timeout configuration",
    "config.py",
    old_str="TIMEOUT = 10",
    new_str="TIMEOUT = 30"
)
```

## Context Budget Management

### Understanding Token Distribution

Typical session breakdown:
- System prompts & skills: ~40K tokens (21%)
- Conversation history: ~30K tokens (16%)  
- Available for files: ~120K tokens (63%)

### Monitoring Usage

Run periodic checks:
```bash
# Quick check
python scripts/analyze_tokens.py .

# Detailed analysis with JSON output
python scripts/analyze_tokens.py . --json > token_report.json
```

### Warning Signs

Start a new session or reduce context when:
- Claude asks to see previously loaded files
- Responses become incomplete or generic
- Performance noticeably degrades
- Token usage >85% for multiple messages
- Switching to a completely different feature

## Bash Command Optimization

Commands add output to context. Minimize verbose output:

```bash
# Heavy output ❌
npm install
pip list
git log

# Optimized ✅  
npm install --silent
pip list --format=freeze | head -n 20
git log --oneline -10
```

Use output redirection:
```bash
# Suppress unnecessary output
command > /dev/null 2>&1
command --quiet
command | head -n 20
```

## Project Setup for Context Efficiency

### Step 1: Create Context Guidelines

Add a `.context-notes.md` to your project:

```markdown
## Context Management

### Key Files
- `src/api.py` (large - use line ranges)
- `src/config.py` (small - load freely)

### Context Strategy  
- Work on one module at a time
- Exclude test fixtures (context-heavy)
- Load models individually

### Exclude Patterns
- `data/` directory (large datasets)
- `legacy/` directory (old code)
```

### Step 2: Add Exclusion Patterns

Copy the `.claudeignore` template:

```bash
cp assets/claudeignore-template.txt .claudeignore
```

Edit to add project-specific exclusions.

### Step 3: Organize Code

Structure for selective loading:
```
src/
├── core/       # Core logic (load as needed)
├── api/        # API routes (load by route)
├── models/     # Data models (load individually)
└── utils/      # Utilities (load specific files)
```

Avoid flat structures with many large files.

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Component-Based Loading

Work on one component at a time:
1. Identify the component
2. Load only relevant files
3. Complete the work
4. Move to next component

### Technique 2: Reference Documentation

For large reference files, create summaries:
- Link to external documentation
- Create concise internal docs
- Use code comments for context

### Technique 3: Context Checkpoints

For long tasks:
1. Summarize progress periodically
2. Start fresh session with minimal context
3. Continue with only essential files loaded

### Technique 4: Split Large Files

When a file exceeds 500-1000 lines:
- Split by functionality
- Separate frequently changed from stable code
- Group by dependencies

Example:
```
Before: api.py (2000 lines, ~15K tokens)

After:
api/
├── routes.py (~2K tokens)
├── handlers.py (~3K tokens)  
├── validation.py (~1.5K tokens)
└── utils.py (~750 tokens)
```

- **[quick_reference.md](references/quick_reference.md)**: Quick reference cheat sheet with token budget rules, essential commands, and common patterns

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Bug Fixing
```
"What file contains the authentication logic?"
"Show me the login function in auth.py"
"Update line 45 to fix the validation check"
```

### Pattern 2: Feature Development
```
"What's the structure of the API routes?"
"Show me an example route handler"
"Create a new /users route following that pattern"
```

### Pattern 3: Refactoring
```
"List files in the models/ directory"
"Load models/user.py"
"Refactor to use dataclasses"
[Repeat for each file]
```

### Pattern 4: Code Review
```
"Review auth.py for security issues (lines 1-100)"
"Now review lines 100-200"
[Continue in sections]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Context Feels Heavy

**Solutions:**
1. Run `python scripts/analyze_tokens.py .`
2. Start new session if usage >85%
3. Load only essential files
4. Use line ranges for large files

### Issue: Claude Asks for Previously Loaded Files

**Solutions:**
1. Acknowledge context limitations
2. Start fresh session
3. Load files more selectively
4. Use explicit file references

### Issue: Slow Performance

**Solutions:**
1. Check token usage with analysis script
2. Reduce loaded file count
3. Use view ranges instead of full files
4. Exclude unnecessary directories

### Issue: Need to Work on Large File

**Solutions:**
1. Use line ranges to load sections
2. View structure first, then load relevant parts
3. Make targeted str_replace edits
4. Consider splitting if frequently modified

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Analyze first**: Run token analysis before major work
2. **Load selectively**: Request specific files, not directories
3. **Use line ranges**: For files >500 lines
4. **Query precisely**: Targeted questions get targeted responses
5. **Monitor budget**: Check usage regularly
6. **Reset when needed**: Start fresh for new features
7. **Optimize structure**: Organize code for selective loading
8. **Document strategy**: Create project context guidelines
9. **Exclude appropriately**: Use .claudeignore for vendor code
10. **Think incrementally**: One component at a time

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Daily Development
- Quick token check at start: `python scripts/analyze_tokens.py .`
- Work on one module per session
- Use line ranges for large files
- Start fresh session for new features

### Code Reviews
- Load files individually
- Review in sections for large files
- Focus on changed files only

### Refactoring
- Analyze token usage first
- Plan component-by-component approach
- One file at a time
- Test each file before moving on

### Debugging
- Identify relevant files first
- Load only those files
- Use line ranges for context
- Make precise changes
