# Apple Music API Sync

Sync a playlist from this repository to Apple Music using the [Apple Music REST API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi). No browser automation or Playwright required — all operations are pure HTTP API calls.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user:
- Wants to save a playlist to Apple Music
- Asks to sync, export, or push a playlist to their library
- Wants to create an Apple Music playlist from a markdown file
- Mentions "Apple Music," "sync," or "add to my library" in the context of a playlist
- Wants a headless/automated sync (CI, GitHub Agent tasks)

**Prefer this skill over `apple-music-sync`** when environment variables are configured. Fall back to the browser-based `apple-music-sync` skill if credentials are not available.

## Prerequisites

- **Apple Developer Program** membership
- **MusicKit private key** (.p8 file) from the Apple Developer portal
- **Apple Music subscription** for the user account
- **Node.js** (v18+)

## Environment Variables

All credentials are passed as environment variables (compatible with GitHub secrets):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `APPLE_MUSIC_TEAM_ID` | Your Apple Developer Team ID (10 characters) |
| `APPLE_MUSIC_KEY_ID` | Your MusicKit private key ID (10 characters) |
| `APPLE_MUSIC_PRIVATE_KEY` | Contents of your `.p8` private key file (including `BEGIN`/`END` lines) |
| `APPLE_MUSIC_USER_TOKEN` | Music User Token obtained via MusicKit JS authorization |

### Obtaining Your Music User Token

The Music User Token requires a one-time browser-based authorization flow using MusicKit JS. It lasts approximately 6 months.

Run the included authorization helper:

```bash
export APPLE_MUSIC_TEAM_ID="XXXXXXXXXX"
export APPLE_MUSIC_KEY_ID="XXXXXXXXXX"
export APPLE_MUSIC_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8)"
node .github/skills/apple-music-api/authorize.mjs
```

This opens a local web page where you sign in to Apple Music. The token is printed to stdout — copy it and store it as `APPLE_MUSIC_USER_TOKEN`. When it expires (~6 months), run `authorize.mjs` again.

### Setting Up Locally

```bash
# Option 1: Export directly
export APPLE_MUSIC_TEAM_ID="XXXXXXXXXX"
export APPLE_MUSIC_KEY_ID="XXXXXXXXXX"
export APPLE_MUSIC_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8)"
export APPLE_MUSIC_USER_TOKEN="your-music-user-token"

# Option 2: Use a .env file (not committed — add to .gitignore)
```

### Setting Up for GitHub Agent Tasks

Add each variable as a repository secret in GitHub Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions.

## Tools

### `sync.mjs` — Sync playlist to Apple Music

```bash
# Sync a playlist (create if needed, or recreate to match markdown order)
node .github/skills/apple-music-api/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md

# Only add tracks to library (no playlist management)
node .github/skills/apple-music-api/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md --library-only

# Rename an existing playlist
node .github/skills/apple-music-api/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md --rename-from="Old Name"
```

The script:
1. Parses the playlist name from the `# heading` and tracks from the markdown table
2. **Appends the 🤖 emoji** to the playlist name — all managed playlists are suffixed with this marker
3. **Creates a daily backup** before any sync operation (see Backups below)
4. Resolves all track IDs from Apple Music URLs in the markdown (or falls back to catalog search)
5. Creates a fresh playlist and adds all tracks in the correct order
6. Reports any tracks that couldn't be found or added

**Playlist safety:** The script will only ever modify playlists that end with the 🤖 suffix. User-created playlists without this marker are never touched.

### Backups

Before every sync, the script creates a backup by **renaming** the existing 🤖 playlist to `<name> 🔙 (yyyy-MM-dd)`. The sync then creates a fresh 🤖 playlist from scratch.

**⚠️ Backups are immutable.** Once created, a backup must **NEVER** be modified, renamed, or deleted by automation. The `assertManaged` guard will throw an error if any operation attempts to touch a playlist containing the 🔙 marker. Only one backup per playlist per day is created; if today's backup already exists, it is skipped.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Environment

Verify that all required environment variables are set. If any are missing, inform the user and suggest either setting them up or falling back to the browser-based `apple-music-sync` skill.

### Step 2: Identify the Playlist

Determine which playlist markdown file to sync from the `playlists/` folder.

### Step 3: Run the Sync

```bash
node .github/skills/apple-music-api/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md
```

The sync runs entirely via API calls — no browser window, no sign-in flow, no user interaction needed. It can be run headlessly in CI or GitHub Agent tasks.

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

The script outputs progress to stdout:
- Track resolution phase: shows each track being resolved from URL or search
- Sync phase: shows album-by-album progress as tracks are added

### Step 5: Verify

Ask the user to check the playlist in Apple Music. Confirm the track count and order look correct.

## Error Handling

- If a track cannot be found in the Apple Music catalog, the script reports it and continues with the remaining tracks
- If the Apple Music API returns rate-limiting errors (429), the script backs off and retries
- Server errors (5xx) are retried with exponential backoff
- The user may need to manually add tracks that the script couldn't find (e.g., region restrictions, name mismatches)
- If environment variables are missing, the script fails immediately with a clear error message

## Differences from Browser-Based Skill

| Feature | `apple-music-api` (this skill) | `apple-music-sync` (browser) |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Speed | Fast (API calls) | Slow (browser navigation) |
| Reliability | High (no DOM scraping) | Medium (virtual scrolling, HTTP/2 errors) |
| User interaction | None (fully automated) | Sign-in required on first use |
| Headless | Always headless | Optional `--headless` flag |
| Requirements | Apple Developer credentials | Just a browser |
| CI/CD compatible | Yes (via secrets) | No |
