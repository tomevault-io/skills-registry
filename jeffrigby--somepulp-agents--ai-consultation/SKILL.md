# AI Consultation Skill

Methodology and templates for effective AI consultation workflows with external AI tools like Codex and Gemini.

## When to Use

- Getting second opinions from Codex or Gemini CLI
- Code review consultations
- Architecture decision validation
- Security audits with multiple AI perspectives
- Debugging with alternative diagnostic approaches
- Performance reviews needing fresh insights

## Consultation Types

1. **Code Review / Quality Check** - Focus on quality, security, performance, best practices
2. **Architecture / Design Opinion** - Focus on structure, patterns, scalability, tradeoffs
3. **Debugging / Root Cause Analysis** - Focus on finding causes, suggesting diagnostics
4. **Security Audit** - Focus on vulnerabilities, OWASP, auth, data exposure
5. **Performance Review** - Focus on bottlenecks, algorithms, optimization opportunities

## Key Principles

### Safety First
- Always use sandbox/read-only mode for consultations
- External AI tools should not modify files
- Get user confirmation before any write operations

### Critical Thinking
- Never accept AI suggestions blindly
- Compare external AI perspective with your own analysis
- Validate recommendations before presenting
- Acknowledge when uncertain

### Effective Prompts
- Be specific about files and components to analyze
- Provide relevant context and constraints
- Specify desired output format (line numbers, severity ratings)
- Request prioritization by impact or severity

## Resources

See the reference documents for detailed guidance:

- `references/prompt-templates.md` - Ready-to-use prompt templates for all consultation types
- `references/examples.md` - 12 concrete consultation examples with workflows
- `references/decision-tree.md` - Comprehensive decision logic for choosing consultation types
- `references/consultation-checklist.md` - Quality assurance checklist for consultations
- `references/cli-options.md` - AI CLI options reference for Gemini and other tools

## Quick Start

### Basic Consultation Flow

1. **Identify consultation type** - What does the user need?
2. **Prepare the prompt** - Use templates, be specific
3. **Execute safely** - Always read-only/sandbox mode
4. **Evaluate critically** - Don't accept blindly
5. **Synthesize perspectives** - Combine AI insights with your own
6. **Present clearly** - Prioritize findings, provide action items

### Example Prompt Structure

```
[ACTION VERB] [COMPONENT] for [PURPOSE].

Focus on:
- [ASPECT 1]
- [ASPECT 2]
- [ASPECT 3]

For each finding:
- Provide line numbers
- Rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Suggest remediation steps
```

## Output Format

When presenting consultation results:

### Executive Summary
Brief overview of key findings (2-3 sentences)

### AI's Findings
Organized by priority:
- Critical issues
- High priority
- Medium priority
- Low priority

### Your Analysis
Where you agree/disagree, additional insights

### Synthesis & Recommendations
Combined recommendations with actionable next steps
