# Readwise Content Analyzer

## Overview
This skill analyzes imported Readwise source documents to extract themes, generate insights, and update or create synthesis documents. It works with your curated highlights as the primary signal, optionally fetching original content for additional context.

## When to Apply
Use this skill:
- When user says "analyze [book/article name] from Readwise"
- When user asks to "generate insights" from a Readwise item
- When user wants to identify themes in their Readwise highlights
- When user wants to update synthesis documents with new examples
- When user says "what themes are in [book/article name]?"
- After importing content with `readwise-skill` (if already imported)

**IMPORTANT**: This skill handles BOTH import and analysis in a single workflow. If the content isn't already imported, it will import it first, then analyze it.

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Just browsing/searching Readwise (use `readwise-skill` for search only)
- Analyzing non-Readwise source documents

## Inputs
1. **Item identifier** - Either:
   - Item title/name (e.g., "The Mom Test", "Atomic Habits")
   - Author name (e.g., "Tim Urban")
   - Existing source document path (if already imported)
2. **Analysis depth** (optional) - Quick overview vs. deep analysis

## Outputs
- Theme identification report
- Key insights and patterns
- Suggested synthesis document connections
- New or updated synthesis documents (with user approval)
- Git commit (automatic)

## Instructions for Claude

### Step 0: Check if Import is Needed and Fetch Article Content (CRITICAL)
Before analyzing, determine if the content needs to be imported first, and if it's an article, fetch the full content:

**A. If user provides a title/name (e.g., "analyze 'machines loving grace' from Readwise")**:
1. Search for existing source document in sources/ directory:
   ```
   Glob: /Users/jvincent/Projects/Knowledge System/notes/content notes/sources/*_Readwise.md
   ```
2. Check if any filename matches the title (case-insensitive, fuzzy match)
3. **If NOT found locally**: Search local Readwise index and import
   - Search index: `cd ~/.claude/skills/readwise-skill/scripts && python3 search.py --query "machines loving"`
   - Show results to user for confirmation
   - Get book_id and source_url from search results
   - **If article with URL**: Use WebFetch to get full article content
   - Import with content: `python3 import_item.py --book-id [id] --output-dir ".../sources"`
   - Commit the import to git
   - Then proceed to analysis (Step 1 below)
4. **If found locally**: Check if article needs content added
   - Read the source document
   - If "Full Article Content" section says "_To be fetched from..._"
   - Use WebFetch to get article content
   - Edit document to add full content
   - Commit the update
   - Then proceed to analysis (Step 1 below)

**B. If user provides a file path**: Skip to Step 1 (already imported)

**Example - New Article**:
```
User: "analyze 'machines of loving grace' from readwise"

Claude:
1. Searches sources/ directory - not found
2. Searches local index: python3 search.py --query "machines loving"
3. Shows: "Found: Machines of Loving Grace by Dario Amodei (15 highlights, URL: https://...)"
4. User confirms
5. WebFetch: Retrieves full article from URL
6. Imports: python3 import_item.py --book-id 12345 ... (with article content)
7. Creates: sources/2026-02-25_Dario-Amodei_Machines-Loving-Grace_Readwise.md
8. Commits import
9. Proceeds to analysis with FULL article text + 15 highlights
```

**Example - Already Imported**:
```
User: "analyze machines of loving grace"

Claude:
1. Finds: sources/2026-02-25_Dario-Amodei_Machines-Loving-Grace_Readwise.md
2. Reads file - sees full article content already present
3. Proceeds directly to analysis
```

### Step 1: Read the Source Document
Use the Read tool to load the Readwise source document:
```
Read: /Users/jvincent/Projects/Knowledge System/notes/content notes/sources/YYYY-MM-DD_Author_Title_Readwise.md
```

Extract:
- Title, author, and type (book, article, podcast)
- Source URL (if available)
- All highlights with their locations
- All annotations/notes
- Existing Readwise tags

### Step 2: Fetch Original Content (If Applicable)
For articles, blog posts, videos, and podcasts with URLs:
- Use WebFetch tool to retrieve the original content
- This provides additional context beyond just highlights
- For videos: extract key concepts from the description/transcript if available
- For podcasts: look for show notes or episode descriptions

**Example**:
```
WebFetch:
  url: [source URL from metadata]
  prompt: "Extract the main arguments, key points, and overall thesis of this content.
          Provide a comprehensive summary that complements the user's highlights."
```

Skip this step for books (no URL) or if user's highlights are sufficient.

### Step 3: Analyze Highlights and Identify Themes
Analyze all highlights to identify:

**A. Core Themes**
- What recurring concepts appear across highlights?
- What patterns emerge?
- Group related highlights by theme

**B. Key Insights**
- What are the most powerful ideas?
- What actionable takeaways exist?
- What surprising or counterintuitive points appear?

**C. Connections to Existing Synthesis Documents**
Read existing synthesis documents to find connections:
```
Glob: /Users/jvincent/Projects/Knowledge System/notes/content notes/syntheses/*.md
```

For each existing synthesis:
- Does this source provide examples or quotes?
- Does it reinforce, challenge, or extend existing themes?
- Identify 2-3 most relevant synthesis documents

### Step 4: Present Analysis to User
Create a comprehensive report:

```markdown
## Analysis: [Title] by [Author]

### Content Overview
[2-3 sentence summary based on highlights and/or original content]

### Identified Themes

#### 1. [Theme Name]
**Definition**: [What this theme is about]

```

**D. Create New Synthesis Documents (If Needed)**
If a new theme emerges:
1. Check existing synthesis structure and templates
2. Create new synthesis document following the pattern
3. Include core concept, examples, and sources
4. Add cross-references to related themes

### Step 6: Update Source Document

## Analysis Best Practices

### For Books
- Focus on user's highlights (they've already done the curation)
- Group highlights by chapter/section if location data available
- Look for progression of ideas across the book
- Identify author's main thesis and supporting arguments

### For Articles
- Fetch original content for full context
- Compare what user highlighted vs. full article
- Extract author's main argument
- Note any counterarguments or nuances

### For Podcasts
- Highlights are key moments/quotes
- Fetch show notes or episode description if available
- Note guest name and background
- Identify actionable advice or mental models shared

### For Videos
- Similar to podcasts
- Fetch video description/transcript if possible
- Note timestamps in highlights
- Identify visual concepts that were demonstrated

## Quality Checks
- [ ] All themes have supporting quotes from highlights
- [ ] Synthesis updates maintain existing document structure
- [ ] Source attributions are accurate (author, location)
- [ ] Cross-references use correct wiki-link format `[[filename]]`
- [ ] New synthesis documents follow existing template patterns
- [ ] Git commit message accurately describes changes
- [ ] No duplicate quotes in synthesis documents

## Error Handling
- If source URL is dead/inaccessible: analyze highlights only
- If WebFetch fails: continue with highlights-based analysis
- If synthesis document structure is unclear: ask user for guidance
- If theme doesn't fit existing syntheses: propose new synthesis document
