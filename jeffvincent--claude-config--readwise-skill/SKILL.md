# Readwise Import Skill

## Overview
This skill imports books, articles, podcasts, and other content from your Readwise library into Content Notes as source documents. It fetches all highlights, annotations, and metadata, creating a properly formatted markdown document that can be analyzed later.

## When to Apply
Use this skill when:
- User wants to **only import** without analysis (rare)
- User explicitly says "just import" or "import only"
- User wants to sync/update existing Readwise imports with new highlights
- User asks to search their Readwise library without importing

**IMPORTANT**: Most users want to analyze content after importing. If user says:
- "analyze [item] from Readwise"
- "generate insights from [item]"
- "what themes are in [item]?"

Use `readwise-content-analyzer` skill instead - it will handle BOTH import and analysis automatically.

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Bulk importing entire Readwise library (use on-demand only)
- Reading Readwise content without importing to Content Notes
- Managing Readwise account settings
- Analysis requests (use readwise-content-analyzer instead)

## Inputs
1. **Item identifier** - Either:
   - Item title/name (e.g., "Atomic Habits", "The Mom Test")
   - Author name (e.g., "Tim Urban", "Rob Fitzpatrick")
   - Readwise book ID (if known)
2. **Action** - import (new) or sync (update existing)

## Outputs
- Source document in `/sources/` directory
- Filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD_Author_Title_Readwise.md`
- Includes: metadata, all highlights in chronological order, annotations, tags
- Git commit (automatic)
- Summary of what was imported

## Setup Instructions

### First Time Setup
1. **Get Readwise API Token**:
   - Visit: https://readwise.io/access_token
   - Copy your token

2. **Configure Credentials**:
   ```bash
   echo "READWISE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here" > ~/.claude/secrets/readwise/.env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.claude/skills/readwise-skill
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Test Authentication**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.claude/skills/readwise-skill/scripts
   python3 auth.py
   ```

## Instructions for Claude

### Step 1: Validate Setup
- Check that `~/.claude/secrets/readwise/.env` exists with `READWISE_API_TOKEN`
- If not configured, provide setup instructions to user
- Test authentication:
  ```bash
  cd ~/.claude/skills/readwise-skill/scripts
  python3 auth.py
  ```

### Step 2: Search for Content
If user provides a title or author name (not book ID):
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/readwise-skill/scripts
python3 search.py --query "atomic habits"
```

For specific categories:
```bash
python3 search.py --query "tim urban" --category articles
```

Show results to user and ask which one to import.

### Step 3: Import Content
Once you have the book ID:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/readwise-skill/scripts
python3 import_item.py --book-id 12345 --output-dir "/Users/jvincent/Projects/Knowledge System/notes/content notes/sources"
```

The script outputs JSON with:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "filename": "2026-02-10_James-Clear_Atomic-Habits_Readwise.md",
  "filepath": "/full/path/to/file.md",
  "title": "Atomic Habits",
  "author": "James Clear",
  "category": "books",
  "num_highlights": 47,
  "book_id": "12345"
}
```

### Step 4: Report Results
Tell the user:
- ✅ Successfully imported [Title] by [Author]
- 📝 [N] highlights imported
- 📂 Saved to: `sources/[filename]`
- 🔗 Book ID: [id] (for future syncing)

### Step 5: Auto-Commit to Git
After successful import, automatically commit to git:
```bash
cd "/Users/jvincent/Projects/Knowledge System/notes/content notes"
git add .
git commit -m "Add Readwise import: [Title] by [Author]

Imported [N] highlights from Readwise

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push
```

### Step 6: Suggest Next Steps
After import, ask:
- "Would you like me to analyze this content and generate insights?"
- This leads to the `readwise-content-analyzer` skill

## Syncing Updates

To update an existing import with new highlights:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/readwise-skill/scripts
python3 sync.py --filepath "/Users/jvincent/Projects/Knowledge System/notes/content notes/sources/2026-02-10_James-Clear_Atomic-Habits_Readwise.md"
```

The script:
- Extracts book ID from the existing file
- Fetches latest highlights from Readwise
- Regenerates the entire document with all highlights
- Reports how many new highlights were added

After syncing, commit the changes to git.

## Output Format

Generated source documents have this structure:

```markdown
