## Overview
This Skill takes a User Experience Research (UXR) report in PDF format, extracts and analyzes its content, and generates a comprehensive structured analysis document. The analysis follows a consistent framework designed for strategic planning and cross-research synthesis, with sections covering metadata, big picture insights, key findings, metrics, recommendations, and connections to related research.

## When to Apply
Use this Skill when:
- User provides a UXR report PDF that needs analysis
- User requests analysis of research documents for strategic planning
- User asks to process reports in the "Reports to Review" folder
- A new research document needs to be catalogued and summarized

Do NOT use this Skill when:
- User wants to read an existing analysis (just use Read tool)
- User is asking general questions about research (use existing analyses)
- Report is not a UXR/research document

## Inputs
- **PDF Report Path**: Absolute path to the UXR report PDF file
- **Original URL**: URL of the source document (will prompt user if not provided)
- **Project Context**: Information about HubSpot's Overall Data Strategy and strategic objectives (available in project resources)

## Outputs
- Structured markdown analysis file saved to `~/Projects/writing/resources/UXR Reports/Analysis/`
- Filename format: `[Report_Name]_Analysis_[MM-YYYY].md`
- HTML comment summary at top for quick reference
- Original PDF moved to `Reviewed Reports/` folder after analysis

## Instructions for Claude

### 1. Initial Setup and Information Gathering
1. Use `mcp__prometheus__prometheus_info` to assess the PDF structure and complexity
2. Ask user for the original URL of the report using AskUserQuestion tool:
   - Question: "What is the URL of the original research report?"
   - Header: "Source URL"
   - Provide option to skip if URL doesn't exist
3. Determine current month and year for filename (format: MM-YYYY)

### 2. Extract Report Content
1. Use `mcp__prometheus__prometheus_extract_text` with appropriate settings:
   - `max_tokens_per_chunk`: 8000 (adjust based on prometheus_info recommendations)
   - `include_page_numbers`: true
   - `clean_text`: true
2. If report is very large (>50 pages), consider using `prometheus_split` first
3. Review all extracted chunks to understand full report scope

### 3. Analyze Report Using Master Framework
Read the project context from `~/Projects/writing/resources/CLAUDE.md` to understand HubSpot's Overall Data Strategy and strategic objectives.

Apply deep analysis to identify:
- **Core research questions and methodology**
- **Key findings that challenge assumptions or reveal gaps**
- **Quantitative metrics and data points (specific numbers, percentages, correlations)**
- **Customer pain points and unmet needs**
- **Strategic implications for product/business strategy**
- **Connections to other research in the catalog**
- **Contradictions with existing research**

### 4. Structure the Analysis Document
Use the template in `resources/ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE.md` to create a comprehensive analysis with these sections:

#### HTML Comment Summary (Lines 1-9)
```markdown
<!-- SUMMARY
Title: [Report Title]
Type: [Research Type - e.g., Qualitative UXR Study, Market Analysis, JTBD Framework]
Key Themes: [3-5 core themes, comma-separated]
Core Insights: [2-3 sentences capturing the most critical findings]
Relevance: [How this connects to strategic objectives - SO1-SO5]
Quality: [Assessment: High/Medium/Low - methodology rigor, sample size, actionability]
Last Reviewed: [YYYY-MM-DD]
-->
```

#### Main Document Structure
1. **Title**: `# [Report Name] Analysis`

2. **Metadata**
   - Study Name
   - Created By (researchers/team)
   - Study URL (from user input or "URL not available")

3. **The Big Picture**
   - 2-3 paragraph summary of findings
   - Explicit connection to HubSpot Overall Data Strategy
   - How findings align with or challenge current strategic direction

4. **Key Findings**
   - Itemized list with descriptive headers
   - Each finding includes quick description
   - Group related findings under themes when appropriate

5. **Interesting Metrics** (if applicable)
   - Bullet list of critical data points
   - Format: "X% of Y do Z" or "Metric shows correlation with outcome"
   - Only include if highly significant numbers surface in research

6. **Recommendations**
   - Split into "Strategic Initiatives" and "Tactical Actions"
   - Each recommendation should be actionable and specific
   - Connect to findings explicitly

7. **Connected Research**
   - List 3-5 related studies from the catalog
   - For each: title, brief description of connection
   - Use actual research from `~/Projects/writing/resources/UXR Reports/Analysis/claude.md`

8. **Disconnected Research** (if applicable)
   - Highlight contradictions or challenges aligning with previous research
   - Explain the nature of the contradiction
   - Only include if genuine conflicts exist

9. **Slide/Section Index**
   - Create searchable index of major sections/slides
   - Format: "Slide X: [Key concept]" or "Section: [Key concept]"

### 5. Quality Standards
- **Be Specific**: Use exact numbers, percentages, quotes from the research
- **Be Strategic**: Connect every insight to business implications
- **Be Honest**: Note research limitations, sample size issues, methodology gaps
- **Be Connected**: Reference other research; build knowledge graph
- **Use Clear Language**: Avoid jargon; explain frameworks simply
- **Quote Customers**: When research includes customer quotes, use them to add authenticity

### 6. Save Analysis and Move Original PDF

**Step 1: Generate filename**
- Format: `[Report_Name]_Analysis_[MM-YYYY].md`
- Remove special characters, use underscores
- Include current month-year (e.g., `11-2025`)

**Step 2: Save analysis file**
- Location: `~/Projects/writing/resources/UXR Reports/Analysis/`
- Use Write tool to create the analysis markdown file

**Step 3: Move original PDF to archive**
After successfully creating the analysis, move the original PDF:
- Source: `~/Projects/writing/resources/UXR Reports/Reports to Review/[original_filename].pdf`
- Destination: `~/Projects/writing/resources/UXR Reports/Reviewed Reports/[original_filename].pdf`
- Use Bash tool with `mv` command:
  ```bash
  mv "~/Projects/writing/resources/UXR Reports/Reports to Review/[original_filename].pdf" "~/Projects/writing/resources/UXR Reports/Reviewed Reports/[original_filename].pdf"
  ```
- Confirm the move was successful before proceeding
- Report to user: "Original PDF moved to Reviewed Reports folder"

### 7. Update Catalog
After creating analysis:
1. Add entry to `~/Projects/writing/resources/UXR Reports/Analysis/claude.md`
2. Include in appropriate category
3. Update resource count and statistics

## Reference Materials
