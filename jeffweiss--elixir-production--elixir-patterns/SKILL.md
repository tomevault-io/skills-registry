# Elixir Patterns

## Overview

Start with pure functions. Escalate to processes only when you need runtime concerns — fault isolation, parallelism, or state across calls. Separate domain logic from temporal logic.

## Pattern Escalation

| Level | What | Reach For |
|-------|------|-----------|
| L0 | Pure functions, pipes, Enum | Data transformation with no side effects |
| L1 | Tagged tuples, `with` | Operations that can fail |
| L2 | Ecto.Changeset | Validating external input at boundaries |
| L3 | GenServer (or ETS) | State that persists across calls |
| L4 | Supervisors | Automatic crash recovery |
| L5 | Registry, Task, DynamicSupervisor | Dynamic process pools, concurrent work |
| L6 | Phoenix Contexts, Protocols | Domain architecture boundaries |

```
What are you solving?
  Transform data, no side effects      → Level 0 (pure functions)
  Operations that can fail              → Level 1 (tagged tuples, with)
  Validating external input             → Level 2 (Ecto.Changeset)
  Need state across calls               → Level 3 (GenServer, consider ETS first)
  Process might crash                   → Level 4 (Supervision)
  Many dynamic processes to coordinate  → Level 5 (Registry, Task, DynamicSupervisor)
  Organizing modules into domains       → Level 6 (Contexts, Protocols, Behaviours)
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Reaching for GenServer too early**: Most business logic is pure functions. A GenServer adds memory, serialization, and complexity. Only justified by runtime benefits.
- **Single Global Process on multiple nodes**: GenServer-as-cache diverges silently across nodes. Default to the database for consistency.
- **Unbounded queues**: Every queue must be bounded. Unbounded queues are a latent memory leak.
- **Circuit breakers as default resilience**: They convert partial failures into complete failures. Prefer token bucket retries.
- **Returning error tuples nobody can act on**: If nothing actionable exists, raise instead.

**Read the file that matches your current problem:**

- `escalation-ladder.md` — **When**: Deciding which pattern level to use. Full Pattern Escalation Ladder (Levels 0-6 with code examples and decision triggers)
- `otp-patterns.md` — **When**: Building GenServers, supervisors, or registries. GenServer, Supervisor, Registry, Task, Protocol, SGP anti-pattern, init guarantees, BEAM nuances
- `state-machines.md` — **When**: Modeling workflows with defined states. :gen_statem vs GenServer decision, state timeouts, postpone, state enter callbacks, why not :gen_event
- `overload-management.md` — **When**: System is slow or queues are growing. Back-pressure, load-shedding, circuit breaker critique, token bucket retries, adaptive concurrency
- `domain-patterns.md` — **When**: Organizing business logic code. Phoenix contexts, code quality patterns, pattern matching, tagged tuples, changesets
- `references/contexts.md` — **When**: Designing module boundaries. Full context design patterns, boundaries, anti-patterns, testing
- `async-processing.md` — **When**: Choosing between GenServer, Oban, and Broadway. GenServer vs Oban vs Broadway decision framework, Oban worker patterns, Broadway pipeline architecture, testing
- `metaprogramming.md` — **When**: Considering macros (last resort). When to use macros (last resort), how `use` works, quote/unquote, DSL patterns, hygiene, debugging, common mistakes
- `web-api-design.md` — **When**: Building any external API. API design philosophy: error contracts, pagination, auth boundaries, versioning, input validation
- `web-api-rest-vs-graphql.md` — **When**: Choosing between REST and GraphQL. Decision framework: when to choose REST, GraphQL, or both, with comparison table
- `web-api-rest.md` — **When**: Building REST endpoints. REST with Phoenix: thin controllers, router organization, fallback controllers, param validation, testing
- `web-api-graphql.md` — **When**: Building GraphQL with Absinthe. GraphQL with Absinthe: Dataloader (required), thin resolvers, schema organization, auth middleware, complexity limits, subscriptions, testing
- `boundary-enforcement.md` — **When**: Enforcing architectural invariants mechanically. Structural tests for context boundaries, custom credo rules, cross-context join detection, agent-readable error messages
