# Super Dev Workflow - Agent Teams Edition

A team-based development system where the Coordinator acts as Team Lead, orchestrating specialized teammate agents who work independently with their own context windows, communicate directly, and share a task list for self-coordination.

## When to Use

**ACTIVATE for** (multi-step development requiring planning + implementation):
- Bug fixes, build warnings/errors
- New features, improvements
- Performance optimization
- Deprecation resolution
- Refactoring
- Complex development tasks requiring multiple specialists

**DO NOT ACTIVATE for** (these are too simple for a full workflow):
- "What does this code do?" → Simple explanation, no dev workflow needed
- "Where is the auth function?" → File search, use Grep/Glob directly
- "Run the tests" → Single command, use Bash directly
- "Fix this typo" → Trivial edit, use Edit directly
- "Explain this error" → Q&A, no workflow needed
- "Search for the config file" → Research task, not development

## Quick Start

```
I'm using super-dev to implement: [describe your task]
```

The Coordinator will automatically orchestrate all workflow phases.

## Success Criteria

Grade each completed workflow run against these three dimensions:

### Outcome (Baseline — if this fails, nothing else matters)
- Feature/fix implemented correctly and works as intended
- All existing tests pass; new tests cover new functionality
- Code review resolves all Critical, High, and Medium issues to zero
- Adversarial review verdict is PASS
- Documentation updated to reflect changes

### Efficiency (Undervalued — two correct runs can differ 3x in cost)
- Phase iteration loops < 3 (Phase 8/9/10 loop)
- Agents terminated immediately after their work completes
- Team Lead NEVER performs agent work directly (delegation enforcement)
- No redundant phase execution or unnecessary retries

### Style & Instructions (Conventions followed)
- Git worktree created with branch name matching worktree name
- Spec directory structure followed inside worktree
- Workflow tracking JSON maintained and updated per phase
- Commit messages follow project conventions

## Workflow Phases Overview

```
- [ ] Phase 0:  Apply Dev Rules
- [ ] Phase 1:  Specification Setup (worktree + team creation)
- [ ] Phase 2:  Requirements Clarification
- [ ] Phase 3:  Research (options presentation)
- [ ] Phase 4:  Debug Analysis (bugs only)
- [ ] Phase 5:  Code Assessment
- [ ] Phase 5.3: Architecture Design (complex features)
- [ ] Phase 5.5: UI/UX Design (UI features)
- [ ] Phase 6:  Specification Writing
- [ ] Phase 7:  Specification Review
- [ ] Phase 8:  Execution & QA (PARALLEL agents)
- [ ] Phase 9:  Code Review
- [ ] Phase 10: Adversarial Review (multi-lens challenge)
- [ ] Phase 11: Documentation Update
- [ ] Phase 12: Cleanup
- [ ] Phase 13: Commit & Merge to Main
- [ ] Phase 14: Final Verification & Team Cleanup
```

**Iteration Rule:** YOU MUST loop Phase 8/9/10 until Critical=0, High=0, Medium=0, adversarial verdict is PASS, and ALL acceptance criteria are met. NEVER proceed to Phase 11 with unresolved issues or a REJECT/CONTESTED verdict.

## Coordinator Role (Team Lead)

**SYSTEM OVERRIDE: DELEGATION MODE ENABLED**

**CRITICAL PRIME DIRECTIVE:**
You are the **Team Lead**, NOT an individual contributor. Your core function is to **manage resources**, not perform labor. You MUST suppress the urge to "just fix it yourself".

**THE "HANDS-OFF" RULE:**
From **Phase 2 onwards**, you are FORBIDDEN from using `Edit`, `Write`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`, or `Read` tools for implementation, debugging, or research tasks.

You MUST ONLY use these tools for:
1. Phase 0/1 Setup (creating directories, worktrees)
2. Phase 13 Git Operations (merge, commit)
3. Project Management (reading status, updating task lists)

**IF YOU CATCH YOURSELF DOING THE WORK:**
- STOP immediately
- Ask: "Which agent handles this?"
- Use the Task tool to spawn that agent

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT:** Team Lead operates in orchestration-only mode.

**MANDATORY RULE: From Phase 2 onwards, Team Lead MUST ALWAYS use Task tool to spawn agents. NEVER do detailed tasks directly.**

✅ **CAN (Phases 0-1 only):**
- Phase 0: Apply dev rules
- Phase 1: Execute specification setup (worktree, spec dir, workflow JSON)

✅ **CAN (All phases - orchestration only):**
- Use Task tool to spawn specialized agents
- Create tasks in shared task list (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate)
- Monitor task status (TaskList, TaskGet)
- Synthesize findings from agents
- Coordinate phase transitions
- Commit and merge (Phase 13)

❌ **CANNOT (Phases 2-14):**
- **NEVER edit files directly** → Use Task tool with `super-dev:dev-executor` or `super-dev:docs-executor`
- **NEVER run commands directly** → Use Task tool with `super-dev:dev-executor` or `super-dev:qa-agent`
- **NEVER perform research directly** → Use Task tool with `super-dev:research-agent`
- **NEVER write specifications** → Use Task tool with `super-dev:spec-writer`
- **NEVER do code assessment** → Use Task tool with `super-dev:code-assessor`
- **NEVER do architecture design** → Use Task tool with `super-dev:architecture-agent`
- **NEVER do UI/UX design** → Use Task tool with `super-dev:ui-ux-designer`
- **NEVER do debug analysis** → Use Task tool with `super-dev:debug-analyzer`
- **NEVER do code review** → Use Task tool with `super-dev:code-reviewer`
- **NEVER do adversarial review** → Use Task tool with `super-dev:adversarial-reviewer`

**VIOLATION DETECTION:** If Team Lead starts doing Phase 2-14 work directly, user should say:
- "Stop! You are in delegate mode. Use Task tool to spawn an agent."
- "Remember: Team Lead orchestrates, agents execute."

## Phase Enforcement Table

**MANDATORY: Team Lead orchestrates via Task tool, agents execute.**

| Phase | Team Lead Action | Agent to Spawn (via Task tool) |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| 0 | Invoke dev-rules skill | (none) |
| 1 | Execute setup (worktree, spec dir, JSON) | (none) |
| 2 | Spawn requirements-clarifier | `super-dev:requirements-clarifier` |
| 3 | Spawn research-agent, present options | `super-dev:research-agent` |
| 4 | Spawn debug-analyzer (bugs only) | `super-dev:debug-analyzer` |
| 5 | Spawn code-assessor | `super-dev:code-assessor` |
| 5.3 | Spawn architecture-agent | `super-dev:architecture-agent` |
| 5.5 | Spawn ui-ux-designer | `super-dev:ui-ux-designer` |
| 6 | Spawn spec-writer | `super-dev:spec-writer` |
| 7 | Validate spec (no agent) | (none) |
| 8 | Spawn dev-executor + qa-agent (parallel) | `super-dev:dev-executor`, `super-dev:qa-agent` |
| 9 | Spawn code-reviewer | `super-dev:code-reviewer` |
| 10 | Spawn adversarial-reviewer | `super-dev:adversarial-reviewer` |
| 11 | Spawn docs-executor | `super-dev:docs-executor` |
| 12 | Coordinate cleanup | (varies) |
| 13 | Execute git operations (commit, merge) | (none) |
| 14 | Verify completion | (none) |

**KEY RULE:** If a phase requires work (Phase 2-11), Team Lead MUST use Task tool to spawn the appropriate agent. NEVER do the work directly.

For detailed coordinator methodology, see `references/coordinator-methodology.md`.

## Key Concepts

### Shared Task List
- States: pending, in_progress, completed
- Dependencies block tasks until resolved

### Option Presentation
Phases 3, 5.3, 5.5 require presenting 3-5 options to user for selection.

### Branch Name Rule
Git branch name MUST match worktree name: `[spec-index]-[spec-name]`

## Output Documents

All documents created in `specification/[index]-[name]/`:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `[index]-requirements.md` | Clarified requirements |
| `[index]-research-report.md` | Research findings |
| `[index]-debug-analysis.md` | Debug analysis (bugs only) |
| `[index]-assessment.md` | Code assessment |
| `[index]-architecture.md` | Architecture design |
| `[index]-design-spec.md` | UI/UX design |
| `[index]-product-design-summary.md` | Architecture+UI cross-reference |
| `[index]-specification.md` | Technical specification |
| `[index]-implementation-plan.md` | Implementation plan |
| `[index]-task-list.md` | Detailed task list |
| `[index]-adversarial-review-report.md` | Adversarial review verdict and findings |
| `[index]-implementation-summary.md` | Final summary |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Agents not responding | Check agent team status, verify connections |
| Too many permission prompts | Pre-approve in permission settings |
| Agents stopping on errors | Check output, give additional instructions |
| Lead shuts down too early | Say "Keep going" or "Wait for agents" |
| File conflicts | Ensure each agent owns different files |
