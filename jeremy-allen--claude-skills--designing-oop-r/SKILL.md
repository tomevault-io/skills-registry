# Designing OOP R

This skill covers object-oriented programming in R, including S7, S3, S4, and vctrs-based classes.

## Decision Tree: What Are You Building?

### 1. Vector-like objects (behave like atomic vectors)

**Use vctrs when:**
- Need data frame integration (columns/rows)
- Want type-stable vector operations
- Building factor-like, date-like, or numeric-like classes
- Need consistent coercion/casting behavior
- Working with existing tidyverse infrastructure

Examples: custom date classes, units, categorical data

### 2. General objects (complex data structures, not vector-like)

**Use S7 when:**
- NEW projects that need formal classes
- Want property validation and safe property access (`@`)
- Need multiple dispatch (beyond S3's double dispatch)
- Converting from S3 and want better structure
- Building class hierarchies with inheritance
- Want better error messages and discoverability

**Use S3 when:**
- Simple classes with minimal structure needs
- Maximum compatibility and minimal dependencies
- Quick prototyping or internal classes
- Contributing to existing S3-based ecosystems
- Performance is absolutely critical (minimal overhead)

**Use S4 when:**
- Working in Bioconductor ecosystem
- Need complex multiple inheritance (S7 doesn't support this)
- Existing S4 codebase that works well

## S7 vs S3 Comparison

| Feature | S3 | S7 | When S7 wins |
|---------|----|----|---------------|
| **Class definition** | Informal (convention) | Formal (`new_class()`) | Need guaranteed structure |
| **Property access** | `$` or `attr()` (unsafe) | `@` (safe, validated) | Property validation matters |
| **Validation** | Manual, inconsistent | Built-in validators | Data integrity important |
| **Method discovery** | Hard to find methods | Clear method printing | Developer experience matters |
| **Multiple dispatch** | Limited (base generics) | Full multiple dispatch | Complex method dispatch needed |
| **Inheritance** | Informal, `NextMethod()` | Explicit `super()` | Predictable inheritance needed |
| **Migration cost** | - | Low (1-2 hours) | Want better structure |
| **Performance** | Fastest | ~Same as S3 | Performance difference negligible |
| **Compatibility** | Full S3 | Full S3 + S7 | Need both old and new patterns |

## S7: Modern OOP

S7 combines S3 simplicity with S4 structure. See [s7-examples.md](references/s7-examples.md) for:
- Class definitions with `new_class()`
- Property validation
- Generic and method definition
- Inheritance with `parent`

## S3: Simple Classes

See [s3-examples.md](references/s3-examples.md) for:
- Constructor functions
- Print and format methods
- Simple class patterns

## Practical Guidelines

### Choose S7 when you have:

See [when-s7.md](references/when-s7.md) for:
- Complex validation needs
- Multiple dispatch needs
- Class hierarchies with clear inheritance

### Choose vctrs when you need:

See [when-vctrs.md](references/when-vctrs.md) for:
- Vector-like behavior in data frames
- Type-stable operations

### Choose S3 when you have:

See [when-s3.md](references/when-s3.md) for:
- Simple classes without complex needs
- Maximum performance needs (rare)
- Existing S3 ecosystem contributions

## Migration Strategy

1. **S3 → S7**: Usually 1-2 hours work, keeps full compatibility
2. **S4 → S7**: More complex, evaluate if S4 features are actually needed
3. **Base R → vctrs**: For vector-like classes, significant benefits
4. **Combining approaches**: S7 classes can use vctrs principles internally
