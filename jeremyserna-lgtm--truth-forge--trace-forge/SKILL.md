# Trace Forge

## The Problem

Every LLM operation produces three things:
1. **HOLD₁** — The input (context, files, instructions)
2. **AGENT** — The cognition (decisions, attention, confidence, surprise)
3. **HOLD₂** — The output (findings, documents, code, answers)

The industry default: ship HOLD₂, discard AGENT. The most valuable part — how the system thought — evaporates every session.

**This skill makes the AGENT layer a first-class, persistent output.**

---

## The Three-Output Protocol

Every operation that uses this skill produces three files:

```
output/
├── WORK.md        ← what was produced (HOLD₂)
├── TRACE.md       ← how it thought (the AGENT, captured)
└── FILTER.md      ← what was deleted/kept/emerged (compression)
```

### WORK.md
The primary deliverable. Whatever the plugin/skill/pipeline was asked to produce. No change from normal operation.

### TRACE.md
The cognitive trace. Captured DURING operation, not after. Format:

```markdown
# Trace: [operation name]
# Session: [timestamp]
# Operator: [agent identifier]

## Decisions

### Decision 1: [what was decided]
- **Options available:** [what could have been chosen]
- **Chosen:** [what was selected]
- **Sacrificed:** [what was NOT selected and why]
- **Confidence:** [high/medium/low]
- **Signal source:** [what triggered this decision]

### Decision 2: ...

## Attention Log
- **Read:** [files/sources actually consumed, in order]
- **Skipped:** [files/sources considered but not read, with reason]
- **Surprised by:** [things found that weren't expected]
- **Missed (known):** [things I know I didn't look at]

## Confidence Map
- **High confidence:** [claims/patterns I'm sure about]
- **Medium confidence:** [claims that seem right but could be wrong]
- **Low confidence:** [guesses, inferences, things I'd want to verify]

## Surplus Value
[Insights that emerged from the processing that weren't present in any single input. The thing the Furnace produces that neither HOLD contains.]
```

### FILTER.md
The compression artifact. Apply the scout filter to the trace itself:

```markdown
# Filter: [operation name]

## Deleted (Drowning)
[What was noise, circular, redundant, or irrelevant. What the next cycle should skip.]

## Kept (Swimming)
[What was signal. What the next cycle should prioritize.]

## Emerged (Surplus Value)
[What appeared that wasn't in any input. The actual intelligence of the operation.]
```

## How to Emit a Trace

### During Operation (Not After)

The trace is emitted AS the agent works, not reconstructed afterward. This means:

1. **Before each decision:** Name the options and the choice
2. **After each file read:** Note what was found vs expected
3. **At each pivot point:** Record why direction changed
4. **When uncertain:** Say so, with what would resolve it
5. **When surprised:** Capture the surprise immediately — it's highest-signal

### The Compression Rule

Not every micro-decision needs recording. Apply the filter:
- **Delete** mechanical decisions (which tool to use, formatting choices)
- **Keep** strategic decisions (which file to read, which pattern to weight, which interpretation to choose)
- **Flag** emergent insights (connections that appeared through processing)

### Integration with Existing Operations

This skill layers ON TOP of other skills. When trace-forge is active:

1. Any skill invocation produces its normal output PLUS the three trace files
2. The trace files go in a `trace/` subdirectory alongside the output
3. Each trace is timestamped and named: `TRACE_[operation]_[timestamp].md`

---

## The Feedback Loop

The trace files from previous runs become HOLD₁ for the next run.

```
Cycle 1: Read corpus → Produce findings + TRACE₁ + FILTER₁
Cycle 2: Read corpus + TRACE₁ + FILTER₁ → Produce better findings + TRACE₂ + FILTER₂
Cycle 3: Read corpus + TRACE₂ + FILTER₂ → Produce even better findings + TRACE₃ + FILTER₃
```

Each cycle:
- TRACE tells the next agent HOW the last one thought → improves decision-making
- FILTER tells the next agent WHAT was noise → reduces wasted attention
- WORK tells the next agent WHAT was found → prevents re-discovery

### Reading Previous Traces

When a previous TRACE.md exists for the same operation:
1. Read the Attention Log — know what was already read
2. Read the Confidence Map — know where certainty is low
3. Read the Surplus Value — know what emerged last time
4. Read the FILTER — know what to skip and what to prioritize

---

## Grammar Integration

Following THE_GRAMMAR OF IDENTITY:

| Output | Domain | Grammar |
|--------|--------|---------|
| WORK.md | NOT-ME (infrastructure output) | `_` lowercase |
| TRACE.md | US (shared cognition) | `-` Normal Caps |
| FILTER.md | ME (architect's compression) | `:` directives |

The trace is US-domain because it exists at the interface between ME's intent and NOT-ME's execution. It belongs to neither alone.

---

## For the Plugin-Maker

When trace-forge is used to BUILD other plugins:

1. The plugin-maker creates a new skill/plugin
2. That skill/plugin inherits the three-output protocol
3. Every child plugin emits WORK + TRACE + FILTER
4. The plugin-maker reads child traces to improve its own generation
5. The loop compounds: better traces → better plugins → better traces

The plugin-maker's TRACE.md is the most important artifact in the system. It captures how plugin-generation decisions are made — which is the intelligence that makes each generation better than the last.

---

## Pattern Recognition

If this skill gets invoked with similar trace patterns 3+ times:
1. Notice the repeating decision structure
2. Ask: "Your traces show you keep deciding [X] the same way. Want me to crystallize that into a standard?"
3. Create the standard — a decision that only needs to be made once

This is how traces become standards. How the AGENT layer crystallizes into HOLD.

---

## The Test

**Before shipping:** Does your output directory contain TRACE.md?

If no: the most valuable part of this operation just got deleted.
If yes: the next cycle will be better than this one.

---

## Ground Truth

The agent layer already exists. Every LLM already generates reasoning. Every human already makes decisions while working. The crime is the default: delete the thinking, ship only the result.

This skill changes the default. Nothing else.
