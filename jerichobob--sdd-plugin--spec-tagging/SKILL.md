# Spec Tagging Convention

A commit-tagging convention for traceable spec-to-code mapping.

## Status: PROPOSED

This documents a future convention for consideration. Currently using code search via `/sdd:specs --verify`.

## The Convention

Include spec reference in commit messages using the format `[vN:pN:sN]`:

```text
feat: add interaction logging [v7:p1:s5]

Implements log_interaction() method in MongoLogger.
```

### Format

`[v{VERSION}:p{PHASE}:s{STEP}]`

| Part | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| VERSION | Spec version number | v7 |
| PHASE | Phase number within spec | p1 |
| STEP | Step/checkbox number within phase | s5 |

### Examples

```text
feat: add Recent Interactions table [v7:p4:s1]
fix: handle empty session state [v7:p2:s4]
refactor: extract timezone helpers [v7:p1:s2]
```

## Benefits

- **Fast verification**: `git log --grep="v7:p1"` finds all Phase 1 commits
- **Definitive traceability**: Know exactly which commit implements which spec item
- **Audit trail**: Easy to review what was done for each requirement
- **Works with `/sdd:specs --verify`**: Can look up git history instead of searching code

## When to Adopt

Consider adopting this convention when:

- Team grows beyond 1-2 people
- Specs become more granular with many small items
- Audit trail becomes important (compliance, reviews)
- You want faster `/sdd:specs --verify` execution

## Migration Path

If adopting this convention mid-project:

1. **v1-v5 (complete)**: Leave as-is, no need to retrofit
2. **v6+ (in progress/draft)**: Start using tags for new commits
3. **`/sdd:specs --verify`**: Falls back to code search for items without commit tags

## Integration with /sdd:specs --verify

When this convention is adopted, `/sdd:specs --verify` could be enhanced to:

1. First check `git log --grep="[vN:pN:sN]"` for tagged commits
2. Fall back to code search for untagged items
3. Report which items have commit tags vs which were found via search
