# Note to Video Transcript

## Overview

This skill transforms study notes (Markdown or PDF format) into a ready-to-record video transcript. The output is a 5–8 minute spoken script with natural pacing, smooth transitions, and a clear structure suitable for educational video content.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- You have study notes in Markdown or PDF format
- You want to create a video script from written content
- You need a spoken-language transcript (not just reformatted text)
- Target video duration is 5–8 minutes
- Content should maintain educational fidelity while being conversational

## Input Requirements

**Supported Formats:**
- Markdown files (.md)
- PDF documents (.pdf)

**Content Expectations:**
- Structured with headings (# ## ###)
- Contains educational or explanatory content
- Includes concepts, definitions, or step-by-step explanations

## Output Contract

The skill produces `transcript.md` with the following structure:

1. **Title** - Clear, engaging video title
2. **Hook** (10–20 seconds) - Attention-grabbing opening
3. **Intro** - Context + what viewers will learn
4. **Main Sections** (2–5 chapters) - Core content broken into digestible parts
5. **Recap** - Concise bullet summary of key points
6. **CTA** - Call-to-action (follow/like/comment prompt)

**Quality Guarantees:**
- Coverage: All major headings addressed or explicitly marked as omitted
- Length: Target duration ±15% (estimated via words-per-minute)
- Accuracy: No new facts unless clearly labeled as expansions
- Tone: Spoken language, short sentences, smooth transitions

## Deterministic Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Input Format

Determine if input is Markdown or PDF.

### Step 2: Extract Content (PDF only)

If input is PDF:
- Run `scripts/extract_pdf_text.py`
- Convert PDF to Markdown-like text format
- Preserve structure and headings

### Step 3: Normalize Content

Run `scripts/normalize_notes.py` to:
- Preserve headings, code blocks, definitions
- Remove navigation sections, TOC, footers
- Normalize whitespace
- Convert bullet points to speakable sentences when needed

### Step 4: Build Outline

- Map input headings to transcript sections
- Allocate word budget per section based on target duration
- Ensure balanced coverage across topics
- Identify sections to expand or condense

### Step 5: Generate Transcript

Run `scripts/build_transcript.py` with:
- Input: normalized markdown
- Preset: neutral | xiaohongshu | professional
- Target duration: 5-8 minutes

The script will:
- Apply spoken tone transformation
- Create short, natural sentences
- Add explicit transitions between sections
- Insert hook, intro, recap, and CTA

### Step 6: Quality Pass

Perform automated checks:
- **Coverage Check**: Verify all major headings are addressed
- **Length Check**: Estimate duration (150 words/minute for spoken content)
- **Repetition Trimming**: Detect and remove excessive repeated phrases
- **Coherence**: Ensure smooth flow between sections

### Step 7: Write Output

Generate final files:
- `transcript.md` - Main deliverable
- `outline.md` (optional) - Section breakdown with word counts

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Markdown Input

**Input:** `notes/day10.md`
```markdown

### Example 2: PDF with Style Preset

**User Prompt:**
```
Convert notes/research.pdf into a 5–6 minute spoken script using 
the professional preset.
```

The skill will:
1. Extract text from PDF
2. Normalize content structure
3. Apply professional tone preset
4. Generate transcript targeting 5.5 minutes (825 words)

## Style Presets

### Neutral
- Balanced tone
- Medium sentence length (12-18 words)
- Minimal jargon
- General audience
- Simple transitions

### Xiaohongshu
- Conversational, friendly
- Short sentences (8-12 words)
- Emoji usage allowed
- Personal pronouns (we, you, I)
- Engaging hooks and CTAs

### Professional
- Formal but accessible
- Longer sentences (15-20 words)
- Technical terminology welcome
- Industry-standard transitions
- Authoritative tone

## Configuration Options

When invoking the skill, you can specify:

- **Target Duration**: 5-8 minutes (default: 6 minutes)
- **Style Preset**: neutral | xiaohongshu | professional (default: neutral)
- **Output Directory**: Where to save transcript.md (default: current directory)

## Success Criteria

A successful transcript must meet:

1. **Coverage**: Every major heading addressed or omission explained
2. **Length Accuracy**: Within ±15% of target duration
3. **Fact Accuracy**: No invented information (unless clearly marked)
4. **Spoken Quality**: Sounds natural when read aloud
5. **Structure Adherence**: Follows Title > Hook > Intro > Sections > Recap > CTA

## Limitations

- Optimal for 5-8 minute videos (shorter/longer may require manual adjustment)
- Best for educational/explanatory content (not suitable for narrative stories)
- Code-heavy content requires manual review for spoken clarity
- Image/diagram references need manual description

## Error Handling

The skill will warn if:
- Input file is empty or unreadable
- PDF extraction produces minimal text
- Estimated duration far exceeds target (>30% difference)
- Critical headings are missing

## Testing

Run golden file tests:
```bash
python tests/test_golden_output.py
```

This validates:
- Structure compliance
- Coverage completeness
- Length estimation accuracy

## Resources

- Template: `resources/transcript-template.md`
- Style presets: `resources/style-presets/*.md`
- Examples: `examples/`

## Future Enhancements

Planned additions:
- Multi-output pack (shotlist, captions, titles)
- Fidelity modes (strict vs. expanded)
- Long PDF chunking and hierarchical summarization
