# Knowledge Construction

Use this skill when `docmason sync` has prepared staged evidence and the agent must write `knowledge.json`, `summary.md`, or additive `semantic_overlay/<unit-id>.json` sidecars.

This is an internal follow-on workflow behind `knowledge-base-sync`.
In the normal path, the main agent hands this workflow a bounded governed follow-up packet from the latest sync result before any source-level authoring starts.
Ordinary users should not need to invoke it by name.

## Required Capabilities

- local file access
- shell or command execution
- ability to inspect rendered images and extracted artifacts

If the agent cannot inspect rendered images, stop and explain that the environment is not capable enough for multimodal knowledge construction.

## Procedure

1. If the current sync result or workflow handoff provides a governed follow-up packet path such as `lane_b_follow_up.work_path`, open that packet first.
   - prefer the bounded packet path handed off by `knowledge-base-sync`
   - treat that packet as the authoritative source and unit selection scope for this pass
   - do not scan shared-job directories to invent a job id when the bounded packet path is already available
2. Read `knowledge_base/staging/pending_work.json`.
3. If `knowledge_base/staging/hybrid_work.json` exists, treat that file as the authoritative hard-artifact overlay queue inside the current bounded scope.
4. Work only on the staged items selected by the governed packet when one exists; otherwise work only on the staged items listed in `pending_work.json`. Treat each pending source or interaction memory as an independent bounded write scope.
   - when both a governed packet and `hybrid_work.json` are present, use the packet's selected sources and units as the outer boundary and the queued hybrid targets as the inner overlay queue
5. For each assigned pending item, open:
   - `work_item.json`
   - `source_manifest.json`
   - `evidence_manifest.json`
   - `knowledge_base/staging/hybrid_work.json` when the current sync result reported `candidate-prepared`
   - `artifact_index.json` when present
   - `pdf_document.json` when present
   - `spreadsheet_workbook.json` when present
   - `spreadsheet_sheet/*.json` when present
   - `visual_layout/*.json` when present
   - `derived_affordances.json` when it already exists
   - extracted text and structure files
   - rendered assets referenced by the evidence manifest
   - when present, the staged interaction-specific context file such as `interaction_context.json`
6. Build the source semantics from the richest published evidence available instead of defaulting to flattened text:
   - for spreadsheets, prefer workbook, sheet, table, chart, metric, dimension, time-axis, hidden-sheet, and formula summaries over raw cell dumps
   - for PDF and PPTX, prefer section paths, captions, continuation links, procedure spans, region roles, charts, tables, pictures, connectors, groups, and major regions over page-level text alone
   - when the real support is artifact-level, include `artifact_id` in the citation instead of citing only the parent `unit_id`
7. Write `knowledge.json` with the required bilingual fields and only cite real evidence-unit IDs from the matching source.
8. Write `summary.md` with:
   - `# <title>`
   - a line that mentions the source ID
   - `## English Summary`
   - `## Source-Language Summary`
9. When the staged source includes high-value hybrid candidates and the environment can inspect renders, write additive `semantic_overlay/<unit-id>.json` sidecars only for units that are inside the current bounded scope and queued in `hybrid_work.json`.
   - prefer overlay work where deterministic structure is already rich but cross-region or multimodal semantics are still missing
   - keep the hard-artifact boundary intact:
     - use the queued `target_artifact_ids`
     - use the queued `target_focus_render_assets` first
     - use the queued `target_render_assets` and `target_render_page_span`
     - for image-only or scanned PDF pages, treat the published `page-image` artifact as the first-class target instead of pretending the text layer is enough
     - if the baseline focus render is still not legible enough, use the targeted hi-res focus-render helper for that artifact instead of rerendering the whole source
   - overlays must remain additive
   - do not rewrite deterministic sidecars such as `artifact_index.json`, `visual_layout/*.json`, `spreadsheet_*`, or `pdf_document.json`
   - bind overlay claims to consumed inputs, artifact ids when available, explicit uncertainty notes, and the current freshness contract:
     - `origin`
     - `source_fingerprint`
     - `unit_evidence_fingerprint`
     - `covered_slots`
     - `blocked_slots`
10. Avoid placeholders, speculative citations, and unsupported related-source links.
11. Treat `derived_affordances.json` as a published sidecar rather than scratch output.
   - the baseline affordance sidecar is generated deterministically by the repo
   - if you enrich it, keep descriptors compact, evidence-backed, grouped by channel, and explicitly derived rather than source-authored fact
12. When evidence is weak, say so explicitly in `known_gaps`, `ambiguities`, confidence notes, or overlay uncertainty notes instead of inventing certainty.
13. After all assigned staged sources are complete, return control to the main agent so it can rerun `docmason sync --json` or `docmason validate-kb --json`.

## Escalation Rules

- If a staged source or interaction memory requires render inspection and the environment cannot inspect renders, stop that item and report the blocker directly.
- If a cross-source relation is uncertain, omit it rather than guessing.
- If a chart, table, diagram, or region claim cannot be supported by the published artifacts, write the uncertainty explicitly rather than laundering it through a source-level summary.
- If `hybrid_work.json` says a source is `candidate-prepared`, do not declare the governed follow-up complete merely because deterministic publication already succeeded.
- Do not publish, validate, or sign off the final sync result from inside this workflow. That judgment belongs to the main agent.

## Completion Signal

- The workflow is complete when every assigned staged source in the current bounded scope has updated `knowledge.json` and `summary.md`, or when a concrete capability blocker has been surfaced to the main agent.

## Notes

- `summary_source` may equal `summary_en` when the source itself is English.
- `related_sources` should stay light in Phase 3. Only add a relation when the source evidence clearly supports it.
- `semantic_overlay` is for cross-region or multimodal semantics that add value beyond the deterministic substrate. It is not a second primary truth surface.
- If extraction is weak, record that weakness explicitly in `known_gaps` or `ambiguities`. Do not invent certainty.
- Interaction memories should remain explicit about lower trust tier, interaction-derived provenance, and the distinction from authored source documents.
