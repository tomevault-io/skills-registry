# Writing Skills

Create skill files with proper frontmatter + imperative
step-by-step instructions.

## Arguments

- `<skill-name>` — name for the new skill (kebab-case)
- `<description>` — what the skill does

## Steps

### 1. Parse Arguments

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- Skill name (kebab-case)
- Brief description

Ask user if either is missing.

### 2. Gather Requirements

If unclear from description, ask:

- Trigger phrases for description field
- Orchestration (delegates to Task subagents) or direct
  (edits files itself)?
- Arguments accepted?

### 3. Reference Existing Skills

Read 2-3 existing skills for current conventions:

```
ls skills/*/SKILL.md
```

Match the frontmatter style, heading structure, and tool
lists used in the codebase.

### 4. Create Skill File

```bash
mkdir -p skills/{skill-name}
```

Write `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` with this structure:

```markdown
---
name: {skill-name}
description: >
  {What it does + when to use.}
  Triggers: '{trigger1}', '{trigger2}'.
allowed-tools: {Tool1}, {Tool2}
argument-hint: "{args}"
---

# {Skill Title}

{One-line summary.}

## Arguments

- `<arg>` — description
- `--flag` — description

## Steps (or ## Workflow)

### 1. {First Step}

{Imperative instructions.}
```

### 5. Verify

- `name` matches directory name
- `description` uses `>` (folded scalar), not `|`
- `description` includes trigger phrases
- `allowed-tools` is comma-separated on one line, minimal
  for the task
- Title is the skill name only — no suffixes ("Workflow",
  "Skill") or elaboration
- One-line summary uses imperative voice ("Create...", not
  "Creates...")
- `## Arguments` section present when `argument-hint` exists
- Instructions use imperative voice
- Prose wrapped at 80 characters

### 6. Tool Selection Reference

Pick minimal tool set based on skill type:

| Type | Tools |
|------|-------|
| Orchestration | Bash, Read, Task |
| Direct-action | Bash, Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep |
| Team | + SendMessage, TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskList, TaskGet, TeamCreate, TeamDelete |
| Plan-mode | + EnterPlanMode, ExitPlanMode |
| Git-only | Bash |

Notes:
- Orchestration skills use Task to spawn subagents for
  heavy work (see research, review, implement)
- Direct-action skills edit files themselves
- Team tools only needed for multi-agent swarm coordination
- Most skills also include Glob and Grep for search

## Task Integration

Skills that create or track work should use native Claude
Code task tools instead of filesystem documents.

### Common Patterns

- **Create a task**: `TaskCreate` with `subject`,
  `description`, and `activeForm`
- **Store structured data**: use `metadata` field on
  `TaskCreate` or `TaskUpdate` for plans, findings, notes
- **Track status**: `TaskUpdate(taskId, status)` — pending,
  in_progress, completed
- **Read context**: `TaskGet(taskId)` to retrieve full details
- **List work**: `TaskList()` to see all tasks and status

### When to Integrate Tasks

- Skill creates trackable work → create a task
- Skill produces structured output → store in `metadata`
- Skill needs to resume across sessions → use tasks as
  state store
- Skill is fire-and-forget (e.g., git-only) → skip tasks
