description: Generate architecture documentation for Laravel packages. Use when the user asks to create, update, or define the system architecture, technical organization, folder structure, class responsibilities, or architectural decisions. This skill creates structured documentation in docs/architecture/ based on PRD requirements, code standards, and tech stack constraints. Use when this capability is needed.

# Architecture Documentation Generator

Generate comprehensive architecture documentation that defines the technical organization and structure of the Laravel package.

---

## 1. Load Context

Read the following files in order to understand the project:

1. **Product Requirements**: `docs/PRD.md`
    - Understand what needs to be built (functional requirements)
    - Identify scope boundaries (in/out of scope)
    - Note non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)

2. **Code Standards**: `docs/engineering/CODE_STANDARDS.md`
    - Development philosophy (No DDD, pragmatic SOLID, etc.)
    - Architecture goals (extensible, pluggable, testable)
    - Refactoring and autonomy boundaries

3. **Tech Stack**: `docs/engineering/STACK.md`
    - Runtime requirements (PHP 8.4+, Laravel 12)
    - Available dependencies
    - Testing environment (Orchestra Testbench)

4. **Existing Architecture** (if any): `docs/architecture/*.md`
    - Check what architecture documentation already exists
    - Update rather than recreate when possible

---

## 2. Clarify Missing Information

If critical architectural decisions are ambiguous:

- Identify the specific decision point
- Ask **up to five clear questions** in Portuguese (pt-BR)
- Do **not** guess or assume architectural patterns
- Do **not** introduce layers, patterns, or abstractions without asking

---

## 3. Architecture Documentation Structure

Generate architecture documents covering these aspects:

### Core Areas

1. **Package Structure** (`STRUCTURE.md`)
    - Directory organization
    - Namespace mapping
    - File placement rules
    - Where to add new features

2. **Component Architecture** (`COMPONENTS.md`)
    - Core classes and their responsibilities
    - Service Provider role
    - Facade pattern usage
    - Extension points (custom tracing sources)

3. **Data Flow** (`DATA_FLOW.md`)
    - Request lifecycle (incoming → tracing → response)
    - Job dispatch and execution flow
    - HTTP client integration flow
    - Session persistence mechanism

4. **Configuration Architecture** (`CONFIGURATION.md`)
    - Config file structure
    - Environment variable mapping
    - How to add new config options
    - Default values strategy

5. **Extension Architecture** (`EXTENSIONS.md`)
    - How to add custom tracing sources
    - How to replace built-in tracings
    - Contract/interface definitions
    - Pluggability mechanism

### Optional Areas (create only if needed)

- **Security Considerations** (`SECURITY.md`) - If security is critical (e.g., input validation, sanitization)
- **Performance Architecture** (`PERFORMANCE.md`) - If performance optimization is complex
- **Testing Architecture** (`TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md`) - If test organization is non-trivial

---

## 4. File Output Rules

### Naming Convention

Use semantic slugs:

- `docs/architecture/STRUCTURE.md`
- `docs/architecture/COMPONENTS.md`
- `docs/architecture/DATA_FLOW.md`
- etc.

Use **UPPERCASE.md** for architecture documents to distinguish from other docs.

### Content Guidelines

Each architecture document must:

1. **Be implementation-focused**
    - Show actual class names, namespaces, file paths
    - Include directory trees where helpful
    - Reference specific files from the codebase

2. **Be developer-oriented**
    - Answer "where do I add X?" questions
    - Explain "why" architectural decisions were made
    - Document constraints and trade-offs

3. **Be concise**
    - Use bullet points and diagrams (Mermaid)
    - Avoid repeating information from other docs
    - Link to other docs rather than duplicating

4. **Be maintainable**
    - Don't describe every class in detail
    - Focus on patterns and key components
    - Keep synchronized with code changes

---

## 5. Document Template

Use this template for each architecture document:

```markdown
# [Area Name]

**Purpose**: [One sentence describing what this document covers]

---

## Overview

[2-3 paragraphs explaining the high-level architecture of this area]

---

## [Section 1]

[Details, code examples, directory trees, etc.]

---

## [Section 2]

[Continue with logical sections]

---

## Key Decisions

[Document important architectural decisions and rationale]

---

## Extension Points

[If applicable: where and how developers can extend this area]

---

## Related Documentation

- Link to other relevant architecture docs
- Link to PRD requirements this architecture addresses
- Link to code standards that influenced this design
```

---

## 6. Mermaid Diagrams

Use Mermaid diagrams for:

- **Class relationships**: `classDiagram`
- **Data flow**: `flowchart` or `sequenceDiagram`
- **Component organization**: `graph`

Example:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Incoming Request] --> B[TracingMiddleware]
    B --> C{Has Correlation ID?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Use Existing]
    C -->|No| E[Generate New]
    D --> F[Attach to Response]
    E --> F
```

Keep diagrams simple and focused on one concept.

---

## 7. Architecture Principles (from CODE_STANDARDS.md)

Ensure all architectural decisions follow:

- ✅ No DDD (no aggregates, repositories)
- ✅ No unnecessary abstraction
- ✅ Configuration over hard-coded logic
- ✅ Extensible and pluggable by default
- ✅ Clear, single responsibility per class
- ✅ Pragmatic application of SOLID

---

## 8. Validation Checklist

Before completing, verify:

- [ ] All functional requirements from PRD are addressed architecturally
- [ ] Architecture follows code standards (no DDD, pragmatic SOLID)
- [ ] Architecture is compatible with tech stack (Laravel 12, PHP 8.4+)
- [ ] Extension points are clearly documented
- [ ] Directory structure is explicit and clear
- [ ] Key classes and their responsibilities are defined
- [ ] Data flows are documented
- [ ] No unnecessary architectural layers introduced

---

## 9. Output Location

Write all architecture documentation to:

```
docs/architecture/
├── STRUCTURE.md
├── COMPONENTS.md
├── DATA_FLOW.md
├── CONFIGURATION.md
└── EXTENSIONS.md
```

---

## 10. Updating Existing Architecture

When architecture documents already exist:

1. Read existing docs first
2. Identify what needs updating
3. Update specific sections rather than rewriting
4. Maintain consistency with existing style
5. Note breaking changes if architecture evolves

---

## 11. Cross-References

After creating/updating architecture docs:

1. Update `CLAUDE.md` if needed (add references to architecture docs)
2. Ensure PRD requirements trace to architectural components
3. Link architecture docs to relevant code standard sections

---

## Completion Criteria

Architecture documentation is complete when:

1. ✅ All core areas are documented
2. ✅ Developers can answer "where do I add X?" questions
3. ✅ Key architectural decisions are explained with rationale
4. ✅ Extension points are clearly defined
5. ✅ Documents are cross-referenced properly
6. ✅ No architectural violations of code standards exist
