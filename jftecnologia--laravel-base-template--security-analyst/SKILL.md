## 2. Analysis Scope

### OWASP Top 10 (2021)

| ID  | Category                  | What to Look For                                         |
| --- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| A01 | Broken Access Control     | Missing authorization checks, IDOR, privilege escalation |
| A02 | Cryptographic Failures    | Weak encryption, exposed secrets, insecure random        |
| A03 | Injection                 | SQL injection, XSS, command injection, LDAP injection    |
| A04 | Insecure Design           | Missing security controls, business logic flaws          |
| A05 | Security Misconfiguration | Debug mode, default credentials, verbose errors          |
| A06 | Vulnerable Components     | Outdated dependencies with known CVEs                    |
| A07 | Auth Failures             | Weak passwords, session fixation, brute force            |
| A08 | Integrity Failures        | Insecure deserialization, unsigned updates               |
| A09 | Logging Failures          | Missing audit logs, sensitive data in logs               |
| A10 | SSRF                      | Unvalidated URLs, internal network access                |

### Laravel-Specific Concerns

- Mass assignment vulnerabilities (`$fillable` / `$guarded`)
- Blade XSS (unescaped `{!! !!}` output)
- CSRF token validation
- Authentication middleware usage
- Policy and Gate authorization
- Eloquent query injection (raw queries, `whereRaw`)
- File upload validation
- Session security configuration
- Environment variable exposure

---

## 3. Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify Changed Files

Determine which files need security review:

```bash
# If working on a specific task, check files listed in task definition
# If general review, check recently modified files
git diff --name-only HEAD~5
```

Focus on files that handle:

- User input (controllers, requests, middleware)
- Database operations (models, repositories, queries)
- Authentication/authorization (guards, policies, gates)
- External communication (HTTP clients, APIs)
- File operations (uploads, downloads, storage)
- Configuration (config files, environment)

### Step 2: Static Analysis

For each file, check for vulnerability patterns documented in [references/laravel-vulnerabilities.md](references/laravel-vulnerabilities.md).

**Key areas to analyze:**

- **Input Handling**: Unvalidated request input
- **SQL Injection**: Raw queries with user input
- **XSS**: Unescaped Blade output with `{!! !!}`
- **Mass Assignment**: Models without `$fillable` or `$guarded`
- **Authorization**: Missing `authorize()` or policy checks
- **Command Injection**: Unescaped shell commands
- **File Uploads**: Missing type/size validation
- **SSRF**: Unvalidated external URLs

### Step 3: Classify Findings

Rate each finding by severity:

| Severity        | Description                                   | Action                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Exploitable vulnerability, immediate risk     | Must fix before task completion   |
| 🟠 **HIGH**     | Significant vulnerability, likely exploitable | Should fix before task completion |
| 🟡 **MEDIUM**   | Potential vulnerability, context-dependent    | Recommend fixing                  |
| 🔵 **LOW**      | Minor issue, defense in depth                 | Consider fixing                   |
| ⚪ **INFO**     | Best practice recommendation                  | Optional improvement              |

---

## 4. Report Format

Generate a security report with this structure:

````markdown
# Security Analysis Report

**Analyzed**: [Date and time]
**Scope**: [Files or task reviewed]
**Result**: [PASS / PASS WITH WARNINGS / FAIL]

---

## Summary

| Severity    | Count |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 🔴 Critical | 0     |
| 🟠 High     | 1     |
| 🟡 Medium   | 2     |
| 🔵 Low      | 0     |
| ⚪ Info     | 1     |

**Blocking Issues**: [Yes/No - Critical or High findings block task completion]

---

## Findings

### [SEC-001] 🟠 HIGH: SQL Injection in UserController

**Location**: `src/Controllers/UserController.php:45`
**Category**: A03 - Injection
**Description**: User input is concatenated directly into SQL query without sanitization.

**Vulnerable Code**:

```php
$users = DB::select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%" . $request->search . "%'");
```
````

**Recommended Fix**:

```php
$users = DB::select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE ?", ['%' . $request->search . '%']);
```

**References**:

- [OWASP SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)
- [Laravel Database Security](https://laravel.com/docs/queries#raw-expressions)

---

### [SEC-002] 🟡 MEDIUM: Missing CSRF Protection

[Continue for each finding...]

---

## Recommendations

1. [Prioritized list of actions]
2. [...]

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Fix all CRITICAL and HIGH issues
- [ ] Review and address MEDIUM issues
- [ ] Consider LOW and INFO recommendations
- [ ] Re-run security analysis after fixes

```

---

## 5. Integration with Development Workflow

### Before Task Completion

When a development task is about to be marked as `DONE`:

1. **Run security analysis** on files created/modified by the task
2. **Check for blocking issues** (Critical or High severity)
3. **Report findings** to user

**If CRITICAL or HIGH findings exist:**
```

⚠️ Security Analysis: BLOCKING ISSUES FOUND

Task cannot be marked as DONE until the following issues are resolved:

[SEC-001] 🔴 CRITICAL: SQL Injection in TracingMiddleware
[SEC-002] 🟠 HIGH: Missing authorization check

Do you want me to show detailed fix recommendations?

```

**If only MEDIUM/LOW/INFO findings:**
```

✅ Security Analysis: PASS WITH WARNINGS

No blocking issues found. The following recommendations are optional:

[SEC-003] 🟡 MEDIUM: Consider adding rate limiting
[SEC-004] 🔵 LOW: Verbose error message in catch block

Task can be marked as DONE. Do you want to address these recommendations first?

```

**If no findings:**
```

✅ Security Analysis: PASS

No security issues found in the analyzed code.
Task can be marked as DONE.

```

### Relationship with Code Quality

| Concern | Handled By | Examples |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Code formatting | `composer format` (Pint) | PSR-12, indentation |
| Static analysis | `composer analyze` (PHPStan) | Type errors, undefined variables |
| Code style | `composer lint` | Combined quality checks |
| **Security** | **security-analyst skill** | OWASP Top 10, Laravel security |

Security analysis is **separate** from code quality but can be run together before task completion.

## 6. Action Policy

### What This Skill Does

✅ **Analyzes** code for security vulnerabilities
✅ **Reports** findings with severity and location
✅ **Recommends** specific fixes with code examples
✅ **Blocks** task completion for critical issues
✅ **Educates** by linking to security resources

### What This Skill Does NOT Do

❌ **Does NOT automatically modify code**
❌ **Does NOT make security decisions for the user**
❌ **Does NOT replace manual security review**
❌ **Does NOT guarantee code is 100% secure**

### Why No Automatic Fixes?

1. **Context matters**: A finding might be a false positive in specific contexts
2. **Business logic**: Security fixes may affect intended functionality
3. **User ownership**: Developer should understand and validate fixes
4. **Auditability**: Changes should be intentional and traceable

### After Reporting

The user can:
1. **Ask for fix implementation**: "Implemente o fix para SEC-001"
2. **Dismiss finding**: "Ignore SEC-002, é um false positive porque..."
3. **Request more details**: "Explique melhor o SEC-003"
4. **Proceed anyway**: "Prossiga mesmo com os warnings"

## 7. Common Laravel Security Patterns

For detailed secure coding patterns with code examples, see [references/laravel-vulnerabilities.md](references/laravel-vulnerabilities.md).

**Quick Summary:**
- Use FormRequest classes for input validation
- Use Policy classes for authorization
- Use Eloquent or parameterized queries (never concatenate user input)
- Use `{{ }}` for output (never `{!! !!}` with user input)
- Use `@json()` for JavaScript data serialization

---

## 8. Checklist for Manual Review

Quick checklist for security review:

### Input/Output

- [ ] All user input is validated
- [ ] Output is properly escaped
- [ ] File uploads are validated (type, size, name)
- [ ] JSON responses don't leak sensitive data

### Authentication/Authorization

- [ ] Routes have appropriate middleware
- [ ] Actions check user permissions
- [ ] Sensitive operations require re-authentication
- [ ] Session is properly managed

### Database

- [ ] No raw SQL with user input
- [ ] Mass assignment is protected
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted
- [ ] Queries are parameterized

### Configuration

- [ ] Debug mode is off in production
- [ ] Error messages don't leak info
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] CORS is properly configured

### Dependencies

- [ ] No known vulnerable packages
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Unused dependencies removed

## 9. Triggering Security Analysis

Use these phrases to trigger analysis:

- "Analise a segurança do código"
- "Faça uma revisão de segurança"
- "Verifique vulnerabilidades"
- "Security review antes de finalizar"
- "Check OWASP Top 10"

---

## 10. Language Rules

- **Security reports**: English (technical terms, code examples)
- **Conversation with user**: Portuguese (pt-BR)
- **Finding IDs**: SEC-XXX format (e.g., SEC-001, SEC-002)

---

2. ✅ Findings are classified by severity
3. ✅ Each finding has location, description, and fix recommendation
4. ✅ Report is generated with summary
5. ✅ User is informed of blocking issues (if any)
6. ✅ User can make informed decision about proceeding
