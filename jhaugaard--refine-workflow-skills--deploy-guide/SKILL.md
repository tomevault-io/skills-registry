   {domain} {
       reverse_proxy localhost:{port}
   }
   ```

5. Reload Caddy:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload caddy
   ```

2. Cloudflare automatically deploys
3. Monitor build in Cloudflare dashboard

**Option B: Direct Deploy (Manual)**

Using Wrangler CLI:
```bash
# Install/update Wrangler
npm install -g wrangler

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Build project
{build_command}

# Deploy

```
</deployment-process>

<first-deployment-extras>
For first-time deployment:

1. Create project in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Connect to GitHub repository (recommended)
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `out` or `dist` or `.next`
4. Set environment variables in dashboard

</cloudflare-pages>

<fly-io>
<name>Fly.io</name>

<pre-steps>
1. Ensure fly.toml exists
2. Verify Fly CLI installed and authenticated
3. Confirm app created
</pre-steps>

<deployment-process>
**Step 1: Verify fly.toml**
Ensure fly.toml is configured correctly.

**Step 2: Deploy**
```bash
flyctl deploy
```

**Step 3: Monitor deployment**
```bash
flyctl logs
```

**Step 4: Verify running**
```bash
flyctl status
```

**Step 5: Open application**
```bash
flyctl open
```
</deployment-process>

<first-deployment-extras>
For first-time deployment:

   ```

2. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   flyctl auth login
   ```

3. Create app:
   ```bash
   flyctl apps create {app_name}
   ```

4. Create fly.toml (or use `flyctl launch`)

5. Set secrets:
   ```bash
   flyctl secrets set DATABASE_URL="..."
   flyctl secrets set SECRET_KEY="..."
   ```

6. Create database (if needed):
   ```bash
   flyctl postgres create
   flyctl postgres attach
   ```
</first-deployment-extras>
</fly-io>

<hostinger-shared>
<name>Hostinger Shared Hosting</name>

<pre-steps>
1. Ensure FTP/SSH credentials available
2. Verify remote path
3. Confirm PHP version compatibility
</pre-steps>

<deployment-process>
**Option A: Using Git (if SSH available)**

```bash

```bash
rsync -avz --delete \
  --exclude='.git' \
  --exclude='.env' \
  --exclude='node_modules' \
  ./ {username}@{host}:~/public_html/{subdirectory}/
```

**Option C: Using FTP**

Use FileZilla or similar:
1. Connect to FTP server
2. Navigate to public_html
3. Upload files (excluding .env, node_modules, .git)
</deployment-process>

<first-deployment-extras>
For first-time deployment:

1. Create subdirectory (if not root):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/public_html/{subdirectory}
   ```

2. Create .htaccess (for PHP routing):
   ```
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
   ```

3. Configure database in cPanel
4. Create production .env on server
5. Set correct file permissions:
   ```bash
   find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
   find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
   ```
</first-deployment-extras>
</hostinger-shared>

</deployment-targets>

<execution-approach>
For each deployment step:
1. Show the command about to run
2. Ask for confirmation before executing
3. Show output
4. Verify success before proceeding
5. Offer to stop if errors occur
</execution-approach>

### Deployment Record

Created: .docs/deployment-log.md

This file contains:
- Deployment runbook for future deployments
- Rollback procedure
- Environment variables reference
- Troubleshooting guide

---

### Workflow Status

**TERMINATION POINT - MANUAL DEPLOYMENT**

Your application is deployed. You can stop here if you don't need CI/CD automation.

**Next Options:**
1. **Stop here** - Use .docs/deployment-log.md for future manual deployments
2. **Add CI/CD** - Use **ci-cd-implement** skill to automate deployments

---

### For Future Deployments

Quick deployment:
```bash
{quick_deploy_command}
```

See .docs/deployment-log.md for full runbook.

---

### Monitoring Recommendations

- Check logs regularly: `{log_command}`
- Monitor uptime with external service
- Set up alerts for errors

Congratulations on your deployment!

<troubleshooting>

<common-issues>

<docker-issues>
**Container won't start:**
```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs {service_name}

# Rebuild from scratch
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Find process using port
sudo lsof -i :{port}

# Kill process or change port in docker-compose.yml
```

**Out of disk space:**
```bash
# Clean up Docker
docker system prune -a --volumes
```
</docker-issues>

<networking-issues>
**Application not accessible:**
1. Check if container is running: `docker compose ps`
2. Test locally: `curl localhost:{port}`
3. Check Caddy/reverse proxy logs
4. Verify firewall allows traffic: `sudo ufw status`

**SSL certificate not working:**
1. Verify DNS points to server
2. Check Caddy logs: `sudo journalctl -u caddy -f`
3. Wait for certificate propagation (up to 15 minutes)
</networking-issues>

<database-issues>
**Connection refused:**
1. Check database container: `docker compose ps db`
2. Verify DATABASE_URL format
3. Check network: containers must be on same Docker network

**Permission denied:**
1. Verify user credentials in .env
2. Check database user has required permissions
</database-issues>

<cloudflare-issues>
**Build failed:**
1. Check build command matches local
2. Verify Node.js version in dashboard
3. Check build logs in Cloudflare dashboard

**Environment variables:**
1. Set in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Redeploy after changing
</cloudflare-issues>

<fly-issues>
**Deploy failed:**
1. Check fly.toml configuration
2. Verify app name matches
3. Check resource limits (memory, CPU)

**App crashing:**
1. Check logs: `flyctl logs`
2. Verify health check endpoint
3. Check memory usage: `flyctl status`
</fly-issues>

</common-issues>

<integration-notes>

<workflow-position>
Phase 5 of 7 in the Skills workflow chain.
Expected input: Deployable project, .docs/deployment-strategy.md (gathered conversationally if missing)
Produces: Deployed application, .docs/deployment-log.md

This is a TERMINATION POINT for projects not needing CI/CD automation.
</workflow-position>

<flexible-entry>
This skill can be invoked standalone on any deployable project. It gathers deployment target information conversationally if not available in handoff documents.
</flexible-entry>

<when-to-invoke>
- When project development is complete (or MVP ready)
- When user is ready to deploy to production
- For subsequent deployments (use deployment-log.md as runbook)
</when-to-invoke>

<status-utility>
Users can invoke the **workflow-status** skill at any time to:
- See current workflow progress
- Check which phases are complete
- Get guidance on next steps
- Review all handoff documents

Mention this option when users seem uncertain about their progress.
</status-utility>
