# Scribere Ops

## Overview

This skill covers day‑to‑day operations for Scribere and the Semantic Scroll instance, with a focus on safe updates, predictable builds, and instance ownership of templates, assets, and content. It avoids destructive Git actions and keeps changes aligned with the repository specs.

## Workflow

Confirm which repo is in scope (`scribere` engine or an instance), then read `AGENTS.md` and the relevant specs (`docs/build.md`, `docs/ops.md`, `docs/templating.md`, `docs/queries.md`) before proposing changes.
Treat `AGENTS.md` as mandatory. It is the entry point for any work in this repo and must be followed throughout.

For first‑time setup, use `npx --yes github:jhlagado/scribere#main` in a fresh folder. This creates the repo, installs Scribere, and copies `/example/` into `/content/`. Do not re‑copy content if `/content/` already exists.

For updates, run `npm run update`. This refreshes the Scribere dependency, syncs the required npm scripts, and ensures `.gitignore` and `AGENTS.md` match current defaults.

For local work, use `npm start` to build, serve, and watch. This writes the lint report to `temp/lint-report.json` without blocking the dev server. Use `npm run build` for a clean one‑shot build, and `npm run lint -- --all` when a full lint sweep is needed.

If a site switches to a custom domain, update `content/site.json` with:

```
npm run domain
```

Instance ownership is strict: templates, assets, client JS, content, and instance queries live under `/content/` in the instance repo. Engine scripts stay at the repo root. Avoid moving templates into the engine unless explicitly requested.

## Output checks

Ensure builds read from `/content/` (falling back to `/example/` only in the engine repo), and that no instance files are overwritten by updates. Verify that template changes remain pure HTML and that queries remain JSON‑only.
