# ClickUp

Interact with ClickUp using their REST API.

## Setup

1. **Check existing credentials:**
   ```
   vault_get clickup_api_token
   ```

2. **If not configured:**
   - Go to https://app.clickup.com/settings/apps
   - Generate an API Token
   - Save to vault:
     ```
     vault_save clickup_api_token "pk_xxx"
     ```
   The token is auto-injected as `$CLICKUP_API_TOKEN`.

    "priority": 2,
    "due_date": 1735689600000,
    "assignees": [USER_ID]
  }' | jq '.'
```
