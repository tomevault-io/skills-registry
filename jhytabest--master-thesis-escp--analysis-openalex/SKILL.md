# Analysis OpenAlex Skill

Use this command surface:

```bash
python <repo_root>/tools/repo_admin.py analysis literature --help
```

Or use the wrapper:

```bash
<repo_root>/skills/analysis-openalex/scripts/run_literature.sh --max-findings 8 --works-per-finding 5
```

Or run the full curation loop:

```bash
<repo_root>/skills/analysis-openalex/scripts/run_foundation_cycle.sh --max-findings 8 --works-per-finding 5
```

## Workflow

- Confirm analysis markdown outputs exist (`NORTHSTAR.md` and/or `jobs/analysis/output/*.md`).
- Run `analysis literature` to extract findings and query OpenAlex.
- Ingest results into the thesis foundation DB with `research ingest-openalex` (quality-filtered + relationship classification).
- Generate a NORTHSTAR-linked snapshot with `research snapshot`.
- Generate a clean curation summary with `research overview`.

## Command patterns

- Default source discovery:
  - `analysis literature --max-findings 8 --works-per-finding 5`
- Explicit sources:
  - `analysis literature --finding-source NORTHSTAR.md --finding-source jobs/analysis/output/regression_report.md`
- Query planning only:
  - `analysis literature --dry-run`
- Foundation ingestion with quality gate + richer metadata:
  - `research ingest-openalex --latest --min-citations 50`
- Snapshot generation:
  - `research snapshot`
- Overview:
  - `research overview`

## Outputs

- JSON report: `local_store/reports/literature/openalex_<run_id>.json`
- Markdown report: `local_store/reports/literature/openalex_<run_id>.md`
- Foundation database: `local_store/research/*.jsonl`
- Derived query DB: `local_store/research/research.db`
- Overview snapshot: `local_store/research/foundation_overview.md`

## Rules

- Prefer `--dry-run` first when changing source selection logic.
- Keep outputs local and commit them if they are part of a reproducible research checkpoint.
- Use `OPENALEX_EMAIL` env var when available for OpenAlex polite pool routing.
- `research ingest-openalex` now supports `--min-citations` (default 50) and relationship classes: `supports`, `challenges`, `contextualizes`, `methodological`, `level-2`.
- `research snapshot` can be re-run independently from existing local JSONL state (no fresh OpenAlex queries required).
