# RenderDoc MCP

Use renderdoc-mcp to analyze GPU frame captures and debug rendering problems.

Always use the MCP server named `renderdoc-mcp` for tool calls.

When you need shell-based or batch workflows outside the MCP tool surface, use `renderdoc-cli` from `PATH`.

## Analysis Framework

Every analysis task follows this flow:

```text
1. Understand goal -> what does the user want to know?
2. Open and gather -> load the capture and collect context in parallel
3. Route -> pick the right diagnostic workflow
4. Execute -> drill down with verification at each step
5. Summarize -> present findings with evidence
```

## Phase 1: Open and Gather Context

### Opening a Capture

From file: call `open_capture` with the `.rdc` path.

From app: call `capture_frame` to launch the app, inject RenderDoc, capture a frame, and auto-open it.

Verification: check the returned event count. If it is `0`, the capture is empty and you should report that immediately.

Error recovery:
- If `open_capture` fails, verify the path exists and points to a valid `.rdc` file.
- If `capture_frame` fails, check the executable path, whether the app needs admin privileges, whether it exits immediately, and whether `delayFrames` should be increased.

### Initial Context Gathering

After a capture is open, call these tools in parallel because they are independent:

| Tool | What it tells you |
|------|-------------------|
| `get_capture_info` | API, GPU, driver, event count |
| `get_stats` | Per-pass draw and triangle counts, top draws, largest resources |
| `get_log` | Validation errors and debug messages; check HIGH severity first |
| `list_passes` | Frame structure: pass names and draw counts |

Before moving on, summarize:
- Which graphics API is in use?
- How many passes and draws are present?
- Are there any HIGH-severity validation errors?
- Which passes or draws look most expensive?

Use that summary as the working context for the rest of the analysis.

## Phase 2: Route to a Workflow

Choose a workflow based on the user's goal:

| User goal | Workflow |
|-----------|----------|
| "Screen is black" or "nothing renders" | Black Screen Diagnosis |
| "Colors are wrong" or "there are artifacts" | Visual Artifact Diagnosis |
| "Performance is bad" or "too slow" | Performance Analysis |
| "Explain what this frame does" | Frame Walkthrough |
| "Debug this specific draw call" | Targeted Draw Inspection |
| "Compare two captures" or "what changed between frames" | Frame Regression Diagnosis |
| General or unclear request | Ask the user what they want to investigate |

## Diagnostic Workflows

### Black Screen Diagnosis

```text
list_draws
  draws = 0?
    -> No geometry submitted. Check:
       - list_events for Clear or Dispatch events
       - get_log for pipeline creation or binding errors
       - report "No draw calls found" with likely causes
  draws > 0?
    -> goto_event for the last draw and get_pipeline_state in parallel
       no render target bound?
         -> report that output goes nowhere
       render target bound?
         -> export_render_target
            render target has content?
              -> likely a present or swapchain issue; inspect Present-related events
            render target is black?
              -> inspect bindings and shaders:
                 - get_bindings
                 - get_shader ps
                 - get_shader vs
```

Parallel opportunity: `goto_event` and `get_pipeline_state` can run in parallel when they target the same `eventId`.

### Visual Artifact Diagnosis

```text
Identify the problematic draw, either from the user or by exporting render targets
  -> goto_event for that draw
  -> get_pipeline_state and get_bindings in parallel
     - inspect blend state
     - inspect render target format
     - inspect bound textures
     - export suspicious textures when needed
     - inspect shaders:
       - get_shader ps mode=disasm
       - get_shader ps mode=reflect
       - search_shaders if you need similar shader matches
```

If multiple draws look suspicious, show the candidate event IDs and names, export their render targets, and ask the user which one looks wrong.

### Performance Analysis

```text
Start from get_stats
  -> inspect top draws by triangle count
  -> goto_event and get_draw_info for heavy draws
  -> inspect pipeline complexity with get_pipeline_state
  -> inspect shader reflection with get_shader vs/ps mode=reflect
  -> inspect oversized resources with get_resource_info
  -> inspect the heaviest pass with get_pass_info
  -> look for redundant draws with similar shaders and resources
```

Report issues by impact. For each one, state what it is, where it occurs, how severe it is, and what the likely improvement is.

### Frame Walkthrough

```text
list_passes
  -> for each important pass:
     - get_pass_info
     - goto_event for the first draw and get_pipeline_state in parallel
     - describe the pass inputs, shaders, and outputs
     - export_render_target to show the pass result
  -> end with a narrative from start to finish
```

Parallel opportunity: when passes are independent analysis tasks, inspect two or three in parallel.

### Pixel-Level Diagnosis

When investigating why a pixel has the wrong color or is missing:

1. **pick_pixel** — Read the current pixel color to confirm the issue
2. **pixel_history** — Find which draws modified this pixel, check if any were culled/discarded
3. **debug_pixel** — Trace the fragment shader execution to find where the wrong value comes from
4. **get_texture_stats** — Check if input textures have unexpected ranges (NaN, all-zero, etc.)

### Shader Debugging

When a draw produces wrong output:

1. **debug_vertex** / **debug_pixel** — Trace shader execution with mode="summary" first
2. If inputs look wrong, check bindings with **get_bindings**
3. If logic seems wrong, re-run with mode="trace" for step-by-step execution

### Frame Regression Diagnosis

When comparing two captures to find rendering differences:

1. `diff_open` captureA captureB → Load both captures
2. `diff_summary` → Quick overview: any differences? Check `divergedAt` field
3. `diff_draws` → Which draws changed/added/removed?
4. `diff_pipeline "MarkerPath"` → What pipeline state changed at that draw?
5. `diff_framebuffer` with `diffOutput` → Pixel-level visual comparison
6. `diff_close` → Clean up

### Targeted Draw Inspection

When the user specifies an event ID or draw name:

```text
goto_event + get_pipeline_state + get_bindings in parallel
  -> describe:
     - vertex shader with get_shader vs mode=reflect
     - pixel shader with get_shader ps mode=reflect
     - bound textures from bindings
     - render targets from pipeline state
     - viewport from pipeline state
  -> go deeper when needed:
     - get_shader vs/ps mode=disasm
     - export_render_target
     - export_texture
     - get_draw_info
```

## Verification Checkpoints

Apply these checks throughout the analysis:

| After this step | Verify |
|----------------|--------|
| `open_capture` or `capture_frame` | Event count is greater than 0 |
| `get_log` | HIGH severity messages are investigated first |
| `list_draws` | Draw count matches expectations |
| `get_pipeline_state` | Shaders are bound and a render target exists |
| `get_bindings` | Expected resources are bound and not null |
| `get_shader` returns empty | The stage may not be bound at this event; try a different stage or event |
| `export_render_target` | The image is not unexpectedly all black or all white |
| Each phase | Summarize what was found, ruled out, and what comes next |

## Error Recovery

| Error | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| `open_capture` file not found | Verify the path and ask for the correct file if needed |
| `open_capture` invalid file | The file may be corrupted or not be an `.rdc`; ask for a new capture |
| `capture_frame` app exits immediately | Check `cmdLine`, `workingDir`, and startup requirements |
| `capture_frame` no frame captured | Increase `delayFrames` and verify the app actually renders to a window |
| `get_shader` empty result | No shader is bound for that stage at this event; try another stage or event |
| `get_pipeline_state` no render target | Some draws do not output to render targets; inspect draw flags |
| `export_render_target` index out of range | Check how many render targets are bound and use a valid index from `0` to `7` |
| `get_resource_info` invalid `ResourceId` | Call `list_resources` first to find a valid ID |
| Any tool says no capture is open | Call `open_capture` first |

## When to Ask the User

Ask before proceeding when:
- Multiple draw calls could be the source of the problem.
- The analysis is ambiguous and you need the user to confirm the most likely hypothesis.
- The user's goal is still unclear after initial context gathering.
- You found a likely root cause but need confirmation before narrowing further.

Do not ask when:
- The next diagnostic step is obvious.
- More data will clearly narrow the problem.
- Exporting an image or texture will give better evidence.
