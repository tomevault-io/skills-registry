# gpt-image-2

GPT Image 2 — released April 2026 — is the first generation that handles long instructional prompts cleanly, renders text correctly (Chinese / Japanese / Korean too), supports custom resolutions (max side < 3840px, ratio ≤ 3:1), and does precise local edits via the `change ONLY X / keep Y exactly` pattern.

This skill teaches you the prompt grammar, the workflow, and gives you a zero-dep CLI that handles auth, parallel batching, retries, and file IO.

## The contract

Always go through `scripts/gpt_image.py`. Don't curl the API directly — the script handles auth, retries, b64-vs-URL responses, multipart for edits, parallel single-image calls when batching, and writes files to disk for you. The user can't see images that only exist in the API response.

## Setup (once per machine)

Two environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_IMAGE_API_KEY="sk-..."                  # required
export OPENAI_IMAGE_BASE_URL="https://jmrai.net/v1"   # default; override only if user has a different host
```

If `OPENAI_IMAGE_API_KEY` is missing, the script exits with a clear message — ask the user for it, then suggest they add the export to `~/.zshrc`.

## Calling the script

Use the absolute path so it works from any working directory:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills/gpt-image-2"   # adjust if installed elsewhere
GPT_IMG="python3 $SKILL_DIR/scripts/gpt_image.py"
```

### Env vars in Claude Code's Bash subshell

Claude Code's Bash tool runs **non-interactive shells that do NOT auto-source `~/.zshrc`**. If the user has the credentials in their shell rc and you get `ERROR: set OPENAI_IMAGE_API_KEY`, prefix every call with a source:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc 2>/dev/null && python3 $SKILL_DIR/scripts/gpt_image.py generate -p "..." -o ./out.png
```

Or, if the user provided the key in-conversation, pass it inline (don't write it to disk yourself):

```bash
OPENAI_IMAGE_API_KEY="sk-..." OPENAI_IMAGE_BASE_URL="https://jmrai.net/v1" \
  python3 $SKILL_DIR/scripts/gpt_image.py generate -p "..." -o ./out.png
```

Test once at the start of a session: `source ~/.zshrc && echo "${OPENAI_IMAGE_API_KEY:0:10}"`. If that prints a key prefix, you can safely use the source-prefix pattern for the rest of the session.

### Generate

```bash
$GPT_IMG generate \
  -p "<prompt>" \
  --size 1536x864 \
  -o ./hero.png
```

Defaults: `--quality high` (cost is identical across tiers on this host), `--size 1024x1024`.

### Edit (precise local change)

```bash
$GPT_IMG edit \
  -i ./input.png \
  -p "Edit the input image: change ONLY <X>. Preserve exactly: <Y>. Do not: <Z>." \
  -o ./edited.png
```

### Inpaint (mask-based)

White pixels in the mask = region to regenerate; transparent = keep.

```bash
$GPT_IMG edit -i ./photo.png --mask ./mask.png \
  -p "Fill the masked area with continuation of the cobblestone street, matching perspective and lighting." \
  -o ./inpainted.png
```

### Multiple variants in parallel

`-n N` fires N **parallel** single-image requests. Faster wall-clock than serial, and works regardless of host n>1 support.

```bash
$GPT_IMG generate -p "..." -n 4 --concurrency 4 -o ./out
# writes out-1.png … out-4.png
```

### What the host does NOT support

- **Multi-image input** (composing two source images in one /edits call). For composition, do it in two steps: generate or edit a base, then edit again with the next layer described. The script errors if you pass `-i` more than once.
- **Transparent backgrounds** (`--background transparent` returns HTTP 400). For sprites / icons / cutouts, use a **chroma-key color in the prompt** (`solid magenta #FF00FF background`) and remove it client-side after with `rembg` or ImageMagick (see `references/post-process.md`).
- Aspect ratios above 3:1 or sides ≥ 3840px. The script validates upfront.

Run `python3 $SKILL_DIR/scripts/gpt_image.py --help` (or `<subcommand> --help`) for every flag.

## Sizes — pick deliberately

| Use case | Size | Aspect |
|----------|------|--------|
| PPT slide / web hero / YouTube thumbnail | `1536x864` (true 16:9) or `1792x1024` | 16:9 / 7:4 |
| Square: app icon, social, logo, character portrait | `1024x1024` | 1:1 |
| High-res square / print poster | `2048x2048` | 1:1 |
| Mobile poster, story, vertical infographic, book cover | `1024x1536` | 2:3 |
| Tall mobile-first hero | `1024x1792` | 9:16ish |
| Wide cinematic banner | `1792x1024` | 16:9ish |

Wrong aspect ratio = wasted generation. Decide BEFORE writing the prompt.

## The workflow for any image task

1. **Clarify intent** only if truly ambiguous. Otherwise infer — auto mode means ship.
2. **Pick the right reference** for the use case (table below).
3. **Write the prompt** following the structure: *Intent → Scene → Subject → Details → Text → Style → Constraints*. See `references/prompting.md`.
4. **Pick size** from the table above.
5. **Call the script.** Save to a sensible path next to the user's project, not `/tmp`.
6. **VISUALLY VERIFY** — Read the saved PNG yourself. Check: does the text render correctly? Is the composition what you asked for? Did the style land? See § "Visual self-verification" below.
7. **Iterate** if the verification fails. Change ONE dimension and regenerate.
8. **Show the user** — Read the final PNG so it appears inline. Tell them the path.

## Visual self-verification (use your vision)

After every generation, before reporting success to the user, **Read the PNG yourself** and verify against the prompt:

- **Text:** Does each quoted string render exactly? No invented characters? Right font weight?
- **Layout:** Is the negative space where you asked for it? Is the subject on the right side of the frame if you said so?
- **Composition:** Right camera angle? Right framing? Centered if you said centered?
- **Style:** Did the named reference land, or did the model default to generic AI-soup?
- **Negatives obeyed:** No extra hands, no watermarks, no rogue text, no clutter you forbade?

If anything fails, iterate. **Change ONE dimension** (per `references/prompting.md` §6) and regenerate. Don't ship the user a bad result and ask them to verify — your vision is faster than their patience.

If you fired multiple variants (`-n 4`), pick the best one yourself before showing the user. Don't dump four files on them and ask them to choose unless they explicitly want options.

## When to load deeper references

Read these on demand — don't preload them.

| User wants | Read this |
|------------|-----------|
| Prompt-writing technique, style vocabulary, intent-first framework, anti-patterns to avoid | `references/prompting.md` |
| Concrete templates: pitch decks, UI mockups, posters, character sheets, infographics, logos, photoreal, edits | `references/use-cases.md` |
| Compress, resize, convert, combine, add text post-hoc | `references/post-process.md` |
| Full parameter list, error codes, custom-resolution constraints | `references/api.md` |

## Core prompt principles (cheat sheet)

The full guide is in `references/prompting.md`; the irreducible minimum:

1. **Open with intent**, not subject. *"Create a pitch-deck slide titled…"* beats *"A chart and some KPIs"*.
2. **Quote every character** that should appear, exactly once. For Chinese, name the script flavor (`黑体`, `楷书`, `思源黑体`).
3. **Use spec language, not praise language.** *"50mm f/2.8, soft north-window light from the left"* beats *"beautiful professional lighting"*.
4. **For edits: change ONLY X / preserve Y exactly.** Always state both.
5. **One style anchor**, not five. Name an artist, film, movement, or game.
6. **Drop the magic words.** *4K, 8K, ultra detailed, masterpiece, trending on artstation* — pre-GPT-Image-2 noise. Useless or harmful now.
7. **Default `--quality high`** (cost is the same on this host). Use lower tiers only for fast throwaway iteration.
8. **Iterate, don't stack.** One dimension change per regen.

## Self-check before calling the API

- [ ] Does the prompt open with intent (slide / poster / mockup / photograph / illustration)?
- [ ] Right aspect ratio for the use case?
- [ ] Did I quote every text string the user wants in the image?
- [ ] If this is an edit, am I describing the change AND what to preserve?
- [ ] Is the output path meaningful and discoverable?
- [ ] Am I about to type any of: `4K, 8K, masterpiece, trending on artstation, ultra detailed`? If yes — delete them.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "Make me an image of a cat" | Open with intent, add style, composition, lighting. See prompting.md. |
| Generating in `/tmp` | Save next to user's project so they can find it. |
| Not Reading the result yourself | Visual self-verify EVERY time before showing the user. |
| Showing all `-n 4` variants without picking | Pick the best one yourself unless user asked for options. |
| Asking "what style?" when the user said "a poster" | Make a strong first attempt, then iterate. |
| Curl-ing the API directly | Use the script — handles retries, b64, multipart, parallel. |
| Forgetting Chinese text in quotes | Quote it exactly or model writes nonsense. |
| Stacking magic words | "Ultra detailed 8K masterpiece" makes outputs WORSE on GPT Image 2. |
| Re-describing the whole image in an edit | Describe ONLY the change + what to preserve. |
| Trying to compose two input images in one /edits call | Not supported on this host — chain two edit calls. |

## Freedom to be creative

These rules guide quality, not creativity. When the user says "surprise me" or leaves room:
- Pick a distinctive style with conviction (don't default to "modern minimalist")
- Push compositions: low angles, dutch tilts, asymmetric layouts, generous negative space
- Fire 3–4 parallel variants when exploring (`-n 4 --concurrency 4`) — same wall-clock as one
- For art briefs, propose a style direction in one sentence before generating, so the user can redirect cheaply

## Ship-quality bar

A result is ready to show the user when:

- ✅ Read-and-judged by you, not just generated
- ✅ Text (if any) renders exactly the quoted string
- ✅ Composition matches the prompt (subject placement, negative space, camera)
- ✅ Style landed (named reference is recognizable)
- ✅ No obvious AI failures (warped hands, melted text, ghost limbs)
- ✅ Saved at a path the user can find
