# Surge Configuration Assistant

## Documentation Priority

When answering Surge questions, always follow this source priority:

1. **Release Log** (appcast): Most up-to-date, overrides others on conflicts
   - `https://nssurge.com/mac/latest/appcast-signed-beta.xml`
2. **Surge Manual** (authoritative reference): Exact option definitions
   - `https://manual.nssurge.com/` | LLM: `https://manual.nssurge.com/llms.txt`
3. **Surge Knowledge Base** (guides & FAQs): Tutorials, troubleshooting, best practices
   - `https://kb.nssurge.com/surge-knowledge-base/zh` | LLM: `https://kb.nssurge.com/llms.txt`

**Always use Context7 MCP tools** to fetch latest docs when generating config or setup steps.

## Profile Structure

Surge config is INI format with `[Section]` segments:

```ini
[General]        # Global settings (key = value)
[Ponte]          # Surge Ponte private network
[Proxy]          # Proxy server definitions
[Proxy Group]    # Policy groups (select, smart, fallback, url-test, subnet, load-balance)
[Rule]           # Traffic routing rules (ORDER MATTERS)
[Host]           # Local DNS mapping
[URL Rewrite]    # URL rewrite rules
[Header Rewrite] # Header modification
[Map Local]      # Mock local responses
[SSID Setting]   # Per-network settings
[MITM]           # HTTPS decryption config
[WireGuard xxx]  # WireGuard interface definitions
```

### Detached Profile (Config Separation)

Use `#!include` to split config into modules:

```ini
[Proxy]
#!include config/proxy-cloud.dconf, config/proxy-home.dconf

[Rule]
#!include config/vpn.dconf, surge.conf
```

- `#!include` cannot be mixed with regular content: If a section uses `#!include`, it can only contain `#!include` directives (and comments), and cannot contain regular rule/definition lines at the same time. If additional content needs to be added, it should be placed in the referenced dconf file.
- Referenced file MUST contain corresponding `[Section]` declaration
- Suffix convention: `.conf` for complete configs, `.dconf` for partial segments
- One level of include only (no nested includes)
- Multiple includes in one section → section becomes read-only in UI
- Can include managed profile URLs directly (Linked Profile, Mac 6.0+)

## Key Policy Groups

### Smart Group (Recommended over url-test/fallback)

```ini
Proxy = smart, ProxyA, ProxyB, ProxyC, interval=600, timeout=5
```

- Real-time dynamic optimization with per-site tuning
- Adaptive retry: failover mid-connection without user noticing
- Weight tuning: `policy-priority="Premium:0.9;SG:1.3"` (<1 = higher priority)
- Cannot use other groups as sub-policies
- Cannot handle geo-lock detection
- Snell reuse conflict resolved in Mac 6.0+

### Subnet Group

```ini
VPN跳板 = subnet, default = Home, "SSID:MyWiFi" = DIRECT, "ROUTER:192.168.2.1" = DIRECT
```

Auto-switch based on network environment. Match types: `SSID:`, `BSSID:`, `ROUTER:`, `TYPE:` (CELLULAR/WIFI/WIRED), `DEVICE-NAME:`.

### Fallback / URL-Test

```ini
可用切换 = fallback, ProxyA, ProxyB, interval=600, timeout=5
自动测速 = url-test, ProxyA, ProxyB, interval=600, tolerance=100, timeout=5
```

- `tolerance` (url-test only, default 100ms): prevents unnecessary switching
- `evaluate-before-use=true`: block requests until first test completes
- Error classification (A-E) determines auto-retest triggers

## Rule Writing Best Practices

Rules are matched top-to-bottom. First match wins.

```ini
[Rule]
# Domain rules first (no DNS needed)
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,google.com,Proxy
DOMAIN,specific.example.com,DIRECT

# Then IP rules (trigger DNS resolution)
IP-CIDR,192.168.0.0/16,DIRECT,no-resolve
GEOIP,CN,DIRECT

# Final catch-all
FINAL,Proxy,dns-failed
```

### Key principles:
1. **Put non-DNS rules before DNS-triggering rules** to avoid unnecessary resolution
2. **Add `no-resolve`** to IP rules when possible to skip DNS
3. **Use `dns-failed`** on FINAL with proxy policy to handle DNS failures gracefully
4. **Use `extended-matching`** for rules that should also match via SNI/Host sniffing

### Accessing home network from outside:

```ini
# Only route home network when NOT at home
AND,((NOT,((SUBNET,ROUTER:192.168.2.1))), (IP-CIDR,192.168.2.0/24,no-resolve)),Home
```

## DNS Configuration

### General DNS setup:

```ini
[General]
dns-server = 223.5.5.5, 114.114.114.114           # Traditional DNS
encrypted-dns-server = tls://223.5.5.5             # DoT/DoH
hijack-dns = 8.8.8.8:53, 8.8.4.4:53               # Hijack hardcoded DNS
always-real-ip = *.srv.nintendo.net, *.stun.playstation.net  # Preserve NAT type
```

### DNS resolution flow:
- Surge triggers local DNS only for: IP-type rules (without `no-resolve`), proxy server hostname, DIRECT policy
- With proxy policy, DNS resolves on proxy server side (optimal)
- `use-local-host-item-for-proxy = true`: use local Host mapping for proxy connections

### Per-network DNS (SSID Setting):

```ini
[SSID Setting]
SSID:HomeWiFi dns-server="192.168.2.1", encrypted-dns-server="off"
```

## Gateway Mode (Mac as Router)

### Two modes:
1. **Enhanced Mode (Surge VIF)**: Also handles local device traffic
2. **Surge VM Gateway** (Mac 6.0+): Better performance, Layer 2, but conflicts with VM bridging

### Client setup:
- Gateway: Surge Mac's IP (or VM Gateway IP)
- DNS: `198.18.0.2` (IPv4) / `fd00:6152::2` (IPv6)

### DHCP auto-config:
- Disable router's DHCP first
- Surge Mac must use wired connection + static IP
- IPv6 RA Override for complete IPv6 takeover

### Performance notes:
- P2P apps can overwhelm Surge (works at L7, not L3)
- VM UDP Fast Path: auto-activates for UDP-heavy clients (≥10/1s or ≥30/10s)
- PS Portal workaround: `IP-CIDR,<PS5-IP>/32,REJECT-DROP,pre-matching,no-resolve`

## Surge Ponte (Private Network)

### Server setup (Mac):
```ini
[Ponte]
server-proxy-name = ProxyForNAT  # or omit for direct NAT traversal
```

### Client usage:
```ini
[Ponte]
server-proxy-name = "🏡 Home"     # As Ponte server
# OR
client-proxy-name = Home           # As Ponte client only
```

### Access patterns:
- Domain: `ponte-name.sgponte` (e.g., `mymacmini.sgponte:8080`)
- Policy: `DEVICE:PONTE-NAME` as proxy to use that device as gateway
- Rule: `IP-CIDR,192.168.30.0/24,DEVICE:MyMacMini`

### Requirements:
- Same iCloud account across devices
- Full Cone NAT (A-type) for direct traversal, or use proxy for NAT traversal
- Mac 6.0+: Multiple channels, IPv6 direct, auto-select fastest

## REJECT Policies

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `REJECT` | Return error page (HTTP) or close connection |
| `REJECT-TINYGIF` | Return 1px GIF (for web ad blocking) |
| `REJECT-DROP` | Silent drop (prevents retry storms) |
| `REJECT-NO-DROP` | Same as REJECT but never auto-upgrades to DROP |

Auto-upgrade: 10+ REJECTs in 30s → automatically becomes REJECT-DROP.

## MITM Configuration

```ini
[MITM]
skip-server-cert-verify = true
tcp-connection = true
h2 = true                    # Enable HTTP/2 for MITM
hostname = *.example.com     # Domains to decrypt
hostname-disabled = ...      # Temporarily disabled domains
```

- SSL Pinning apps (Apple, Facebook, Instagram, X) cannot be MITM'd
- iOS 15+: UA not visible in CONNECT requests without MITM

## Proxy Provider Integration

### Three modes:
1. **Managed profile**: Full config from provider (read-only)
2. **Linked profile**: Track `[Proxy]` + `[Proxy Group]` from managed, edit rest locally
3. **External policy group** (recommended for advanced users):

```ini
Provider = select, policy-path=https://airport.com/surge.conf, hidden=true
US-Nodes = smart, include-other-group=Provider, policy-regex-filter=US|美国
```

### Multi-provider fusion:

```ini
Awesome = select, policy-path=https://a.com/surge.conf, hidden=true, external-policy-name-prefix=A-
Fantastic = select, policy-path=https://b.com/surge.conf, hidden=true, external-policy-name-prefix=B-
All-US = smart, include-other-group="Awesome,Fantastic", policy-regex-filter=US|美国
```

### Relay (chain proxy):

```ini
Provider = select, policy-path=https://provider.com/surge.conf, external-policy-modifier="underlying-proxy=JumpProxy"
```

## Snell v5 Protocol

- Dynamic Record Sizing: better latency under packet loss
- QUIC Proxy Mode: UDP-over-UDP for QUIC traffic (avoids TCP-over-UDP issues)
- Shadow TLS v3 support
- Server download: check KB release notes

```ini
Proxy = snell, server.com, 8443, psk=xxx, version=5, reuse=true, tfo=true, shadow-tls-password=xxx, shadow-tls-sni=www.microsoft.com, shadow-tls-version=3
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Request not in Dashboard | Takeover issue: check system proxy (`scutil --proxy`) or enhanced mode (`ping apple.com` → `198.18.x.x`) |
| Request appears but fails | Forwarding issue: check Notes tab for error (Connection refused/timeout/No DNS) |
| Only IPs, no domains | DNS not pointing to `198.18.0.2`; or encrypted DNS bypassing Fake IP |
| High battery on iOS | Normal: all network traffic counted under Surge; actual extra <2%/24h |
| QUIC blocked | Expected: TCP proxy + QUIC = double retransmission; use Snell v5 QUIC mode if needed |
| NAT type degraded | Configure `always-real-ip` for STUN domains |
| "Network quality poor" | Check DNS servers (avoid 8.8.8.8 in mainland China) |
