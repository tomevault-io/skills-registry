# Terraform State Manager

This skill guides you through safe Terraform state manipulation operations.

## When to Use

- Importing existing cloud resources into Terraform management (`terraform import`)
- Renaming resources or moving them into/out of modules (`terraform state mv`)
- Removing resources from Terraform control without destroying them (`terraform state rm`)
- Migrating state between backends (e.g., local to GCS/S3)
- Fixing state locks or corruption

## Critical Safety Rules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ALWAYS** follow these rules to prevent data loss or service downtime.

1.  **Backup First**: Create a backup of your state file (`.tfstate`) before ANY operation.
    ```bash
    terraform state pull > backup.tfstate
    ```
2.  **Plan After**: Run `terraform plan` immediately after any state change to verify the result is a "no-op" (no changes detected) or matches expectation.
3.  **One by One**: Perform operations incrementally rather than in bulk.
4.  **Communicate**: Ensure no one else is running Terraform during maintenance.

## Common Operations

### 1. Importing Resources

Use when you have a resource in the cloud but not in Terraform state.

1.  **Write Config**: Create the `resource` block in your `.tf` files.
2.  **Import**:
    ```bash
    terraform import <resource_address> <cloud_id>
    # Example: terraform import google_storage_bucket.my_bucket my-project-bucket-name
    ```
3.  **Verify**: Run `terraform plan`. It should be empty or show only minor metadata updates.

### 2. Moving Resources (Refactoring)

Use when renaming resources or moving them into modules.

```bash
terraform state mv <source_address> <destination_address>
# Example: terraform state mv google_storage_bucket.old_name module.storage.google_storage_bucket.new_name
```

### 3. Removing Resources

Use when you want to stop managing a resource with Terraform but keep it running.

```bash
terraform state rm <resource_address>
```

### 4. Migrating Backend

Use to change where state is stored.

1.  **Update Config**: Change the `backend` block in `versions.tf` or `backend.tf`.
2.  **Migrate**:
    ```bash
    terraform init -migrate-state
    ```
    Answer "yes" to copy the state to the new location.

## Troubleshooting

- **State Lock**: If a process crashed and left a lock:
    ```bash
    terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
    ```
    *Warning: Be absolutely sure no other process is running.*
