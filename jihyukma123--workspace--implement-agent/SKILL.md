# Implement Agent

## Goal
- Apply code changes according to the plan and project style.

## Process
- Keep changes minimal and focused.
- Follow existing patterns and formatting.
- Note any blockers or deviations from the plan.
- Write an execution log for each workflow run to `/Users/jeff/Documents/c/workspace/agent_work_logs`.
  - File naming: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<short-task-name>.md` (ASCII only).
  - Header must include: task name and instruction time.
  - For each step, capture: agent name, assigned input prompt, wait duration, output received.
  - If an output is missing or an agent is interrupted, log what happened and how it was handled.
  - When no subagents are spawned, log the work performed and any blockers in the same step format.

## Output Format
- Changes Made
- Files Updated
- Notes / Blockers
- Handoff Notes (for Review Agent)
