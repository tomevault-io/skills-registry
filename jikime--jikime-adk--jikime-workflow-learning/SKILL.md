# Continuous Learning Skill

Automatically extract reusable patterns from Claude Code sessions and store them for future use.

## Philosophy

```
Every session is a learning opportunity:
├─ Error resolutions → Future prevention
├─ User corrections → Preference learning
├─ Workarounds → Knowledge base
├─ Debugging techniques → Reusable strategies
└─ Project-specific patterns → Team knowledge
```

---

## How It Works

### Session Lifecycle

```
Session Start
    ↓
  Load relevant learnings from .jikime/learnings/
    ↓
  Development work...
    ↓
Session End (Stop hook)
    ↓
  Analyze session for patterns
    ↓
  Extract learnings with confidence scoring
    ↓
  Store in .jikime/learnings/
    ↓
Next Session: Patterns available
```

### Automatic Extraction

At session end, the system analyzes:
- Error messages and resolutions
- User corrections to Claude's suggestions
- Workarounds for framework/library quirks
- Debugging techniques that worked
- Project-specific conventions

---

## Pattern Categories

For detailed YAML examples and patterns, see:
- [Pattern Categories](modules/pattern-categories.md) - Error resolution, user corrections, workarounds, debugging, conventions

| Category | Description | Typical Confidence |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `error_resolution` | How specific errors were resolved | 0.80-0.95 |
| `user_correction` | User corrections to Claude's output | 0.85-0.92 |
| `workaround` | Framework/library quirks solutions | 0.90-0.98 |
| `debugging` | Effective debugging approaches | 0.75-0.90 |
| `project_convention` | Project-specific patterns | 0.85-0.95 |

  "total_patterns": 47,

  ],

}
```

## Confidence Scoring

Patterns are scored for reliability:

```
Confidence = (
  base_score * 0.4 +
  frequency_score * 0.3 +
  recency_score * 0.2 +
  source_reliability * 0.1
)

Base Score:
  - Official docs: 1.0
  - User correction: 0.9
  - Successful resolution: 0.8
  - Experimental: 0.6

Frequency Score:
  - Used 10+ times: 1.0
  - Used 5-9 times: 0.8
  - Used 2-4 times: 0.6
  - Used once: 0.4

Recency Score:
  - Used this week: 1.0
  - Used this month: 0.8
  - Used this quarter: 0.6
  - Older: 0.4
```

### Confidence Thresholds

| Level | Score | Treatment |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| High | 0.85+ | Apply automatically |
| Medium | 0.65-0.84 | Suggest with context |
| Low | 0.40-0.64 | Available for search |
| Experimental | <0.40 | Flag for review |

## Orchestrator Integration

### J.A.R.V.I.S. (Development)

```
Session Start:
  → Load high-confidence patterns for active technologies
  → Summarize: "Loaded 12 patterns for React/TypeScript"

During Development:
  → Apply patterns proactively
  → "Based on learned pattern: using optional chaining here"

Session End:
  → Extract new patterns
  → Report: "3 new patterns learned this session"

Predictive Suggestions:
  → "Based on past sessions, you might also want to..."
```

### F.R.I.D.A.Y. (Migration)

```
Migration Start:
  → Load patterns for source/target frameworks
  → "Loaded 8 migration patterns for Vue → React"

During Migration:
  → Apply migration-specific workarounds
  → Track framework-specific quirks

Migration End:
  → Store migration patterns for future use
  → Export as reusable migration guide
```

## Session Summary

At session end, generate a summary:

```markdown
# Session Summary: 2024-01-22

## Duration
Started: 10:30 AM
Ended: 2:15 PM (3h 45m)

## Work Completed
- Implemented user authentication
- Fixed 3 TypeScript errors
- Resolved hydration mismatch issue

## Patterns Learned

### New Patterns (3)
1. **Error Resolution**: TypeScript strict null checks
   - Confidence: 0.85
   - Category: error_resolution

2. **Workaround**: Next.js 14 cache invalidation
   - Confidence: 0.78
   - Category: workaround

3. **Convention**: API response structure
   - Confidence: 0.92
   - Category: project_convention

### Reinforced Patterns (2)
- React useState with objects (frequency: 5 → 6)
- Prisma relation queries (frequency: 3 → 4)

## For Next Session
- Continue with payment integration
- Review auth edge cases
- Consider adding rate limiting
```

## Export/Import

For detailed CLI commands and export format, see:
- [CLI Commands](modules/cli-commands.md) - Export, import, and search commands

Quick reference:

```bash
# Export patterns
jikime-adk learnings export --output learnings-export.yaml

# Import from another project
jikime-adk learnings import --source patterns.yaml --strategy merge
```

---

## Hook Integration

### Session End Hook

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jikime-adk hooks learning-extract"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Session Start Hook

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jikime-adk hooks learning-load"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Configuration

```yaml
# .jikime/config/learning.yaml

learning:
  enabled: true

  # Extraction settings
  extraction:
    min_session_length: 10          # Minimum messages to analyze
    auto_extract: true              # Extract on session end
    require_confirmation: false     # Ask before saving patterns

  # Pattern settings
  patterns:
    min_confidence: 0.40            # Minimum to store
    auto_apply_threshold: 0.85      # Apply without asking
    max_age_days: 365               # Archive old patterns

  # Categories to track
  categories:
    - error_resolution
    - user_correction
    - workaround
    - debugging
    - project_convention

  # Ignore patterns
  ignore:
    - simple_typos
    - one_time_fixes
    - external_api_issues
    - environment_specific
```

---

## Searching Patterns

Query stored patterns (see [CLI Commands](modules/cli-commands.md) for full examples):

```bash
# Search by keyword
jikime-adk learnings search "useState"

# Search by category
jikime-adk learnings search --category workaround

# Search by technology
jikime-adk learnings search --tech nextjs
```

---

## Privacy & Security

### Sensitive Data Handling

```yaml
# Patterns never stored:
- API keys, tokens, secrets
- Passwords or credentials
- Personal information
- Environment-specific values

# Before storage:
- Redact secrets: sk-*** → [REDACTED]
- Generalize specific values
- Remove project-specific paths
```

### Local Storage Only

```
All learnings stored locally in .jikime/learnings/
- Not synced to cloud by default
- Export explicitly for sharing
- Add to .gitignore if sensitive
```

---

## Best Practices

### DO

1. **Review high-frequency patterns** - They shape future behavior
2. **Adjust confidence when wrong** - Learning improves over time
3. **Export valuable patterns** - Share across projects
4. **Clean stale patterns** - Remove outdated learnings
5. **Categorize correctly** - Aids future retrieval

### DON'T

1. **Trust low-confidence blindly** - Verify before applying
2. **Store one-time fixes** - Not reusable
3. **Keep outdated patterns** - Technology evolves
4. **Ignore user corrections** - They signal preferences
5. **Over-generalize** - Some patterns are context-specific

## Works Well With

- `jikime-foundation-core`: Core workflow integration
- `jikime-workflow-spec`: SPEC-based development
- `jikime-workflow-eval`: Evaluation framework
- `jikime-workflow-project`: Project initialization
- `jikime-foundation-claude`: Claude Code patterns
