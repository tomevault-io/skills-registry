## Implementation Guide

### Module Architecture

Documentation Management Capabilities:

- Template-based documentation generation
- Project type detection for web, mobile, CLI, library, and ML projects
- Multilingual support with localized content
- SPEC data integration for automatic updates
- Multi-format export capabilities

Language Initialization Capabilities:

- Automatic language detection from project content
- Comprehensive language configuration management
- Agent prompt localization with cost optimization
- Domain-specific language support
- Locale management and cultural adaptation

Template Optimization Capabilities:

- Advanced template analysis with complexity metrics
- Performance optimization with size reduction
- Intelligent backup and recovery system
- Benchmarking and performance tracking
- Automated optimization recommendations

### Core Workflows

Complete Project Initialization Workflow:

Step 1: Initialize the project management system by specifying the project directory path

Step 2: Execute complete setup with the following configuration parameters:

- Language setting: Specify the primary language code such as "en" for English or "ko" for Korean
- User name: Provide the developer or team name for personalization
- Domains: List the project domains such as backend, frontend, and mobile
- Project type: Specify the project type such as web_application
- Optimization enabled: Set to true to enable template optimization during initialization

Step 3: Review initialization results which include:

- Language configuration with token cost analysis
- Documentation structure creation status
- Template analysis and optimization report
- Multilingual documentation setup confirmation

Documentation Generation from SPEC Workflow:

Step 1: Prepare SPEC data with the following structure:

- Identifier: Unique SPEC ID such as SPEC-001
- Title: Feature or component title
- Description: Brief description of the implementation
- Requirements: List of specific requirements
- Status: Current status such as Planned, In Progress, or Complete
- Priority: Priority level such as High, Medium, or Low
- API Endpoints: List of endpoint definitions including path, method, and description

Step 2: Generate comprehensive documentation from the SPEC data

Step 3: Review generated documentation which includes:

- Feature documentation with requirements
- API documentation with endpoint details
- Updated project documentation files
- Multilingual versions if configured

Template Performance Optimization Workflow:

Step 1: Analyze current templates to gather metrics

Step 2: Configure optimization options:

- Backup first: Set to true to create backup before optimization
- Apply size optimizations: Enable to reduce file sizes
- Apply performance optimizations: Enable to improve loading times
- Apply complexity optimizations: Enable to simplify template structures
- Preserve functionality: Ensure all features remain intact

Step 3: Execute optimization and review results:

- Size reduction percentage achieved
- Performance improvement metrics
- Backup creation confirmation
- Detailed optimization report

### Language and Localization

Automatic Language Detection Process:

The system analyzes the project for language indicators using the following methods:

- File content analysis examining comments and strings
- Configuration file examination for locale settings
- System locale detection
- Directory structure patterns

Multilingual Documentation Structure:

When creating documentation for multiple languages, the system generates:

- Language-specific documentation directories such as docs/ko for Korean and docs/en for English
- Language negotiation configuration
- Automatic redirection setup between language versions

Agent Prompt Localization:

The localization system provides:

- Language-specific instructions for agents
- Cultural context adaptations
- Token cost optimization recommendations for multilingual prompts

### Configuration Management

Integrated Configuration Status:

The project status includes:

- Project metadata and type classification
- Language configuration and associated costs
- Documentation completion status
- Template optimization results
- Module initialization states

Language Settings Update Process:

When updating language settings, configure the following parameters:

- Conversation language: The language for user-facing responses
- Agent prompt language: The language for internal agent instructions, often kept as English for cost optimization
- Documentation language: The language for generated documentation

Updates trigger the following automatic changes:

- Configuration file modifications
- Documentation structure updates
- Template localization adjustments
