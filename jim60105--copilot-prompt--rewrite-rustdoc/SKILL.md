# Rewrite Rustdoc

Ensure all Rust documentation and comments are exclusively written in English, following rustdoc guidelines.

## Steps

0. Determine which files to process:
   - If the user provides a method to find files, use that method.
   - Otherwise, assume files are in the `src/` directory.
   - Proceed immediately to the next steps after acquiring file information.

1. Conduct a comprehensive review to ensure all documentation and comments are in English.
   - Any Chinese text in documentation or code comments must be identified and corrected.
   - Chinese characters in test case strings are permissible and do not require modification.
   - Chinese report files should not be modified — focus on Rust source code files only.

2. Search for Chinese characters in the source code:
   ```bash
   rg -n "[\u4e00-\u9fff]" src/
   ```
   Check for missing documentation:
   ```bash
   cd src/ && cargo clippy -- -W missing_docs
   ```
   Replace `src/` with the user-specified location if provided.

3. Refer to `./docs/rustdoc-guidelines.md` for documentation structure and style standards.

4. Ensure all corrections adhere strictly to the documentation guidelines.

5. Repeat the search and revision process iteratively until no further occurrences require modification.
   - Do not prompt for confirmation before proceeding to the next item.
   - Complete all necessary changes before reporting back.
