# Update GitHub Actions Version

Update action versions in GitHub Actions workflow files, focusing on major version changes only.

## Important Principles: Explanation of GitHub Actions Version Tagging System

- Using a major version number (e.g., `v4`) automatically fetches the latest minor and patch versions.
- For example, `actions/checkout@v4` will automatically get versions like `v4.2.2`, `v4.3.0`.
- **Do not** update from `v4` to a specific version like `v4.2.2` — this is unnecessary.
- **Only update when the major version changes** (e.g., from `v5` to `v6`).

> **Note:** Skip `fatjyc/update-submodule-action@v6.0` updates as the new version is broken.

## Steps

### 0. Find Workflow Files
Look for files in `.github/workflows/` recursively. Note that composite actions may be used — read both the composite action and the calling workflow simultaneously.

### 1. Check Current Versions
Analyze the action versions used in the workflow files.

### 2. Query Latest Versions
Query each action's latest version:
```
https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest
```

### 3. Identify Actions Needing Updates
Only update actions where the major version has changed:
- ✅ Update: `docker/build-push-action@v5` → `@v6`
- ❌ Skip: `actions/checkout@v4` → `@v4.2.2`

> **Note:** Skip `fatjyc/update-submodule-action@v6.0` updates as the new version is broken and v6.0 is fine.

### 4. Obtain Changelogs
For actions requiring updates, retrieve changelogs to understand breaking changes.

### 5. Update Files
Update version numbers and make adjustments for any breaking changes.

### 6. Commit Changes
Git add and commit your changes with a clear message indicating the updates made.

## Example Illustration

### ✅ Correct Update

```yaml
# From
uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
# Update to 
uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
```

### ❌ Incorrect Update (Unnecessary)

```yaml
# From 
uses: actions/checkout@v4 
# Incorrectly updated to 
uses: actions/checkout@v4 .2 .2  
```

### ✅ Correct Practice (Keep Unchanged)

```yaml
# Keep unchanged 
uses :actions / checkout @ v 4  
GitHub will automatically use the latest v 4.x.x release   
```
