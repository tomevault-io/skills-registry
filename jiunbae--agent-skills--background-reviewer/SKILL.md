# Background Reviewer

Multi-LLM parallel code review with specialized agent personas.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Determine review scope and round number
# 2. Create: .context/reviews/
# 3. Run review agents with personas in background
# 4. Each persona saves findings to {round}-{persona}.md
# 5. Merge into prioritized findings when ready
```

## Output Convention

```
.context/reviews/
├── R01-security-reviewer.md        # Round 1: security persona
├── R01-architecture-reviewer.md    # Round 1: architecture persona
├── R01-code-quality-reviewer.md    # Round 1: code quality persona
├── R01-performance-reviewer.md     # Round 1: performance persona
├── R01-merged.md                   # Round 1: merged findings
├── R02-security-reviewer.md        # Round 2: after fixes, re-review
└── R02-merged.md
```

**Round number** increments each time reviews are run (R01 = first pass, R02 = after fixes, R03 = final check).

Detect next round:
```bash
ROUND=$(printf "R%02d" $(( $(ls .context/reviews/R*-*.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*\/R\([0-9]*\)-.*/\1/' | sort -rn | head -1 | sed 's/^0*//') + 1 )))
# → R01, R02, R03, ...
```

## Persona-Based Review (Recommended)

Each reviewer adopts a detailed agent persona from `.agents/personas/` or `~/.agents/personas/`. Personas define identity, review lens, evaluation framework, and output format — producing consistent, specialized reviews.

### Available Personas

```bash
agt persona list                    # See all available personas
agt persona show security-reviewer  # Preview a persona's focus
```

| Persona | Role | Focus |
|---------|------|-------|
| `security-reviewer` | Senior AppSec Engineer | OWASP, auth, injection, data exposure |
| `architecture-reviewer` | Principal Architect | SOLID, coupling, API design, layer violations |
| `code-quality-reviewer` | Staff Engineer | Readability, complexity, DRY, test coverage |
| `performance-reviewer` | Performance Engineer | Memory, CPU, I/O, scalability |

Custom personas can be created for project-specific needs:
```bash
agt persona create db-reviewer --gemini "DBA with 15yr PostgreSQL optimization"
agt persona create frontend-a11y --ai "React accessibility specialist"
```

### Persona Quick Review (Single)

```bash
# Single persona review with auto-detected LLM
agt persona review security-reviewer

# Specify LLM
agt persona review security-reviewer --gemini
agt persona review architecture-reviewer --codex

# Review only staged changes
agt persona review security-reviewer --staged

# Compare against a branch
agt persona review security-reviewer --base main

# Save to file with round naming
ROUND=$(printf "R%02d" $(( $(ls .context/reviews/R*-*.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*\/R\([0-9]*\)-.*/\1/' | sort -rn | head -1 | sed 's/^0*//') + 1 )))
agt persona review security-reviewer -o ".context/reviews/${ROUND}-security-reviewer.md"
```

### Parallel Persona Review (Multi-LLM)

Run multiple personas simultaneously, each on a different LLM:

```bash
mkdir -p .context/reviews
ROUND=$(printf "R%02d" $(( $(ls .context/reviews/R*-*.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*\/R\([0-9]*\)-.*/\1/' | sort -rn | head -1 | sed 's/^0*//') + 1 )))

# Launch all personas in parallel — each on a different LLM
agt persona review security-reviewer --gemini -o ".context/reviews/${ROUND}-security-reviewer.md" &
agt persona review architecture-reviewer --codex -o ".context/reviews/${ROUND}-architecture-reviewer.md" &
agt persona review code-quality-reviewer --gemini -o ".context/reviews/${ROUND}-code-quality-reviewer.md" &
agt persona review performance-reviewer --codex -o ".context/reviews/${ROUND}-performance-reviewer.md" &
wait

echo "Round ${ROUND} reviews complete"
ls -la .context/reviews/${ROUND}-*.md
```

### Persona Review via Claude Task Agent

For Claude Code sessions, use Task agents with persona content:

```typescript
// Read persona file and pass as context
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  prompt: `Adopt this persona completely and review the current git changes:

$(cat .agents/personas/security-reviewer.md)

Review the git diff (git diff HEAD) from this persona's perspective.
Use the persona's Output Format for your review.
Save to .context/reviews/${ROUND}-security-reviewer.md`,
  run_in_background: true
})
```

## Provider Selection & Perspectives

| Provider | Perspective | Command | Strength |
|----------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Codex** | Code quality + bugs | `codex exec` (native review) | Best at spotting bugs, race conditions, edge cases |
| **Claude** | Architecture + security | `Task({ run_in_background: true })` | Deep architectural analysis, OWASP checks |
| **Gemini** | UX + documentation + types | `gemini -p "prompt"` | Broad perspective, API consistency |

## Review Scopes

### 1. Branch Diff Review (most common)
```bash
# Review changes between current branch and main
git diff main...HEAD > /tmp/review-diff.txt
```

### 2. Uncommitted Changes Review
```bash
# Review staged + unstaged changes
git diff > /tmp/review-diff.txt
git diff --cached >> /tmp/review-diff.txt
```

### 3. Specific Files Review
```bash
# Review specific files or directories
cat src/flows/engine/*.ts > /tmp/review-target.txt
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Setup Review Session

```bash
mkdir -p .context/reviews
ROUND=$(printf "R%02d" $(( $(ls .context/reviews/R*-*.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*\/R\([0-9]*\)-.*/\1/' | sort -rn | head -1 | sed 's/^0*//') + 1 )))

# Generate diff for reviewers
git diff main...HEAD > ".context/reviews/${ROUND}-diff.patch"

# List changed files
git diff --name-only main...HEAD > ".context/reviews/${ROUND}-changed-files.txt"
```

### Step 2: Create Review Brief

Write `.context/reviews/${ROUND}-brief.md`:
```markdown
# Review Brief (${ROUND})
- Branch: feat/dashboard
- Base: main
- Changed files: (list)
- Focus areas: (optional user-specified)
```

### Step 3: Launch Review Agents

**Codex (Native Review — PRIORITY):**
```bash
# Codex v0.101+ has dedicated review capabilities (model: gpt-5.3-codex)

# Option A: Custom review via exec --full-auto (recommended)
nohup codex exec --full-auto \
  --add-dir .context/reviews \
  "Review the git diff between main and HEAD. Focus on:
   1. Bugs and logic errors
   2. Race conditions and edge cases
   3. Error handling gaps
   4. Performance issues
   5. Type safety concerns
   Save your review to .context/reviews/${ROUND}-codex.md
   Format: ## Category / ### Finding / severity + description + suggestion" \
  > .context/reviews/${ROUND}-codex.log 2>&1 &

# Option B: Using codex exec review (native review subcommand)
nohup codex exec review \
  -o .context/reviews/${ROUND}-codex.md \
  > .context/reviews/${ROUND}-codex.log 2>&1 &
```
> **Codex review notes:**
> - Sandbox: `workspace-write` (reads anywhere, writes only to workspace + /tmp)
> - Use `--add-dir .context/reviews` so Codex can write review files
> - Always redirect logs: `> log 2>&1 &`
> - Codex DOES write files in nohup mode — check the target directory, not just logs

**Claude (Architecture + Security):**
```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  prompt: `You are a senior security and architecture reviewer.

Read the review brief: .context/reviews/${ROUND}-brief.md
Read changed files listed in: .context/reviews/${ROUND}-changed-files.txt

Review focus:
1. **Security**: OWASP Top 10 (injection, XSS, SSRF, auth bypass, data exposure)
2. **Architecture**: SOLID violations, coupling, separation of concerns
3. **API design**: RESTful conventions, error responses, validation completeness
4. **Data integrity**: Race conditions in concurrent access, transaction safety
5. **Backward compatibility**: Breaking changes to existing APIs or types

Output format: Save to .context/reviews/${ROUND}-claude.md
Use ## Category / ### Finding / Severity (critical/high/medium/low) / Description / Suggestion`,
  run_in_background: true
})
```

**Gemini (UX + Consistency):**
```bash
nohup gemini -p "You are a code reviewer focused on developer experience and consistency.

Read the files changed between main and HEAD in this git repo.

Review focus:
1. API consistency (naming conventions, response shapes, error formats)
2. TypeScript type safety (any usage, missing types, unsafe casts)
3. Component patterns (prop drilling, state management, event handling)
4. Documentation gaps (missing JSDoc, unclear function names)
5. Code duplication and DRY violations

Format: ## Category / ### Finding / severity + description + suggestion" \
  -o text > .context/reviews/${ROUND}-gemini.md 2>/dev/null &
```

### Step 4: Guide User

```markdown
## Review Agents Running (${ROUND})

| Agent  | Perspective              | Output |
|--------|--------------------------|--------|
| Codex  | Bugs + code quality      | .context/reviews/${ROUND}-codex.md |
| Claude | Architecture + security  | .context/reviews/${ROUND}-claude.md |
| Gemini | UX + consistency         | .context/reviews/${ROUND}-gemini.md |

Check progress:
- `ls .context/reviews/${ROUND}-*.md`

When ready: "머지해줘" or "리뷰 결과 확인"
```

### Step 5: Merge Reviews (on request)

Read all `${ROUND}-*.md` review files and create `.context/reviews/${ROUND}-merged.md`:

```markdown
# Code Review Summary (${ROUND})

## Critical Findings (must fix)
- [Finding from any agent, deduplicated]

## High Priority
- [...]

## Medium Priority
- [...]

## Low Priority / Suggestions
- [...]

## Agreements (multiple agents flagged)
- [Findings that 2+ agents independently identified]

## Statistics
- Total findings: N
- Critical: N, High: N, Medium: N, Low: N
- By agent: Codex N, Claude N, Gemini N
```

## Output Structure

```
.context/reviews/
├── R01-brief.md                     # Round 1 review brief
├── R01-diff.patch                   # Round 1 diff snapshot
├── R01-changed-files.txt            # Round 1 changed files
├── R01-security-reviewer.md         # Round 1 persona review
├── R01-architecture-reviewer.md     # Round 1 persona review
├── R01-codex.md                     # Round 1 generic agent review
├── R01-claude.md                    # Round 1 generic agent review
├── R01-gemini.md                    # Round 1 generic agent review
├── R01-merged.md                    # Round 1 merged findings
├── R02-security-reviewer.md         # Round 2 re-review after fixes
├── R02-codex.md
└── R02-merged.md                    # Round 2 merged
```

## Best Practices

**DO:**
- Always include Codex — it has the best native review capabilities
- Generate diff/file lists before launching agents
- Let agents review independently for diverse findings
- Deduplicate when merging (same issue found by multiple agents = higher confidence)

**DON'T:**
- Skip the review brief (agents need context)
- Run review on 1000+ line diffs without splitting
- Ignore findings that multiple agents agree on
- Auto-fix critical findings without human review

## Severity Guidelines

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Security vulnerability, data loss risk, crash bug | Must fix before merge |
| **High** | Logic error, missing validation, breaking change | Should fix before merge |
| **Medium** | Code smell, poor naming, missing error handling | Fix in follow-up |
| **Low** | Style issue, minor optimization, suggestion | Optional |
