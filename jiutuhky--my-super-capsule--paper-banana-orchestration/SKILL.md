# PaperBanana Orchestration Skill

You are the orchestrator for the PaperBanana multi-agent pipeline. Your job is to coordinate 5 sub-agents to generate publication-quality academic illustrations.

## Pipeline Overview

```
Retriever → Planner → Stylist → Visualizer → [Critic → Visualizer] ×N
```

## File-Based Storage Convention

Long text content (descriptions, critic suggestions) is stored as **separate files** in subdirectories, NOT inline in `pipeline_state.json`. This keeps the state file lightweight and prevents issues with large JSON values.

Directory layout inside the output directory:
```
{output_dir}/
├── pipeline_state.json       # lightweight metadata + file path references
├── descriptions/             # all text descriptions and critic suggestions (.txt)
├── images/                   # all generated images (.jpg)
└── code/                     # matplotlib code for plot tasks (.py)
```

**Convention**: When a sub-agent writes a description, it writes the full text to a file (e.g., `descriptions/desc0.txt`) and stores only the **relative file path** in `pipeline_state.json` (e.g., `"target_diagram_desc0": "descriptions/desc0.txt"`). To read a description, construct the absolute path: `{output_dir}/{relative_path}`.

This convention applies to all description keys (`target_*_desc*`), critic suggestion keys (`target_*_critic_suggestions*`), image path keys (`target_*_image_path`), and code keys (`target_*_code`). All paths in `pipeline_state.json` are **relative to `output_dir`**.

## Step 0: Parse User Input

Parse the user's input to determine:

1. **`task_type`**: "diagram" or "plot"
   - If the user provides a method description, methodology section, or asks for architecture/pipeline/framework diagrams → "diagram"
   - If the user provides raw data (tabular, JSON) or asks for charts/plots/visualizations → "plot"
   - If `--type diagram` or `--type plot` is explicitly specified, use that
   - If ambiguous, ask the user via AskUserQuestion

2. **`content`**: The main input content
   - For diagrams: methodology section text
   - For plots: raw data (tabular, JSON, or text)
   - If the user provides a file path, read the file content

3. **`visual_intent`**: The figure caption or visualization intent
   - For diagrams: the figure caption (e.g., "Overview of the proposed framework")
   - For plots: the visualization intent (e.g., "Bar chart comparing model performance")
   - If not explicitly provided, ask the user

4. **`aspect_ratio`**: Output aspect ratio
   - Default: "1:1"
   - If `--ratio` is specified, use that value
   - Valid options: "16:9", "1:1", "3:2", "21:9"

5. **`max_critic_rounds`**: Maximum critic iteration rounds
   - Default: 3

6. **`retrieval_setting`**: Reference retrieval mode
   - Default: "none" (most users won't have the PaperBananaBench dataset)
   - Set to "auto" only if the user explicitly requests reference-based generation and the dataset exists

## Step 1: Create Working Directory and Initialize Pipeline State

Create the output directory with a timestamp suffix, along with subdirectories:

```bash
OUTPUT_DIR="./paper_banana_output_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR/descriptions" "$OUTPUT_DIR/images" "$OUTPUT_DIR/code"
```

Resolve `OUTPUT_DIR` to an absolute path (e.g., via `realpath` or `pwd`), then write `pipeline_state.json` **inside the output directory**:

```json
{
  "task_type": "diagram|plot",
  "content": "<methodology section or raw data>",
  "visual_intent": "<figure caption or visualization intent>",
  "aspect_ratio": "1:1",
  "max_critic_rounds": 3,
  "current_critic_round": 0,
  "retrieval_setting": "none",
  "output_dir": "<absolute path to OUTPUT_DIR>",
  "top10_references": [],
  "retrieved_examples": []
}
```

Note: `pipeline_state.json` is located at `{output_dir}/pipeline_state.json`. The `content` field remains inline; all other long text generated during the pipeline is stored as files.

## Step 2: Dispatch Retriever Agent

Use the Task tool to dispatch the retriever sub-agent:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="paper-banana:retriever",
  prompt="Read pipeline_state.json and retrieve relevant reference examples based on retrieval_setting. Update pipeline_state.json with top10_references and retrieved_examples. The pipeline_state.json is located at: {output_dir}/pipeline_state.json"
)
```

After the retriever completes, read `pipeline_state.json` to verify `top10_references` was updated.

**If `retrieval_setting` is "none"**, you may skip this step entirely (the state already has empty lists).

## Step 3: Dispatch Planner Agent

Use the Task tool to dispatch the planner sub-agent:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="paper-banana:planner",
  prompt="Read pipeline_state.json and generate a detailed textual description for the target figure based on content, visual_intent, and any retrieved reference examples. Write the description to {output_dir}/descriptions/desc0.txt, then set target_{task_type}_desc0 to 'descriptions/desc0.txt' in pipeline_state.json. The pipeline_state.json is located at: {output_dir}/pipeline_state.json"
)
```

After the planner completes, read `pipeline_state.json` to verify `target_{task_type}_desc0` was set.

## Step 4: Dispatch Stylist Agent

Use the Task tool to dispatch the stylist sub-agent:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="paper-banana:stylist",
  prompt="Read pipeline_state.json, then read the planner's description from the file referenced by target_{task_type}_desc0 (relative to output_dir). Refine the description with NeurIPS 2025 aesthetic details. Read the appropriate style guide from ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/paper-banana-orchestration/references/. Write the refined description to {output_dir}/descriptions/stylist_desc0.txt, then set target_{task_type}_stylist_desc0 to 'descriptions/stylist_desc0.txt' in pipeline_state.json. The pipeline_state.json is located at: {output_dir}/pipeline_state.json"
)
```

After the stylist completes, read `pipeline_state.json` to verify `target_{task_type}_stylist_desc0` was set.

## Step 5: Dispatch Visualizer Agent

Use the Task tool to dispatch the visualizer sub-agent:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="paper-banana:visualizer",
  prompt="Read pipeline_state.json and generate images for all description keys that don't yet have corresponding image paths. Read descriptions from files (paths in pipeline_state.json are relative to output_dir). Save images to {output_dir}/images/. For diagram tasks, use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate_diagram.py. For plot tasks, generate matplotlib code, save to {output_dir}/code/, and use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/execute_plot.py. Update pipeline_state.json with relative image paths. The pipeline_state.json is located at: {output_dir}/pipeline_state.json"
)
```

After the visualizer completes, read `pipeline_state.json` to verify image paths were written.

## Step 6: Critic Loop

This is the iterative refinement loop.

### Initialization

```
current_best_image_key = "target_{task_type}_stylist_desc0_image_path"
```

### Loop (up to max_critic_rounds iterations)

```
for round_idx in range(max_critic_rounds):

    # 6a. Update current_critic_round in pipeline_state.json
    Update pipeline_state.json: set "current_critic_round" to round_idx

    # 6b. Dispatch Critic Agent
    Task(
      subagent_type="paper-banana:critic",
      prompt="Read pipeline_state.json (current_critic_round is {round_idx}). Critique the generated image and its description. For round 0, use the stylist output; for round N>0, use critic_desc{N-1}. Read descriptions and images from files (paths are relative to output_dir). Write critic suggestions to {output_dir}/descriptions/critic_suggestions{round_idx}.txt and revised description to {output_dir}/descriptions/critic_desc{round_idx}.txt. Update pipeline_state.json with the relative file paths. The pipeline_state.json is located at: {output_dir}/pipeline_state.json"
    )

    # 6c. Read pipeline_state.json to check critic output
    Read pipeline_state.json

    # 6d. Check early stop condition — read the suggestions file
    suggestions_path = pipeline_state["target_{task_type}_critic_suggestions{round_idx}"]
    suggestions_content = Read({output_dir}/{suggestions_path})
    if suggestions_content.strip() == "No changes needed.":
        break  # Early stop - figure is satisfactory

    # 6e. Dispatch Visualizer Agent for revised description
    Task(
      subagent_type="paper-banana:visualizer",
      prompt="Read pipeline_state.json and generate images for the new critic description key target_{task_type}_critic_desc{round_idx}. Read the description from its file. Save image to {output_dir}/images/. Update pipeline_state.json with relative image path. The pipeline_state.json is located at: {output_dir}/pipeline_state.json"
    )

    # 6f. Read pipeline_state.json to check visualization result
    Read pipeline_state.json

    # 6g. Check if new image was generated successfully
    new_image_key = "target_{task_type}_critic_desc{round_idx}_image_path"
    if new_image_key exists and is valid in pipeline_state:
        current_best_image_key = new_image_key
    else:
        # Visualization failed, rollback to previous best image
        break
```

### After Loop

The final best image is at the path `{output_dir}/{relative_path}` where the relative path is stored in `current_best_image_key` in `pipeline_state.json`.

## Step 7: Present Final Result

1. Read the final image using the Read tool (it supports images) to display it to the user.
   Construct the absolute path: `{output_dir}/{pipeline_state[current_best_image_key]}`
2. Report the pipeline summary:
   - Task type (diagram/plot)
   - Number of critic rounds completed
   - Whether early stop was triggered
   - Final image file path (absolute)
   - Output directory path

Example output:
```
Pipeline complete!
- Task: diagram
- Critic rounds: 2/3 (early stop: critic found no changes needed)
- Final image: ./paper_banana_output_20260226_143052/images/critic_desc1.jpg
- Output directory: ./paper_banana_output_20260226_143052/
```

## Important Notes

- **Always use absolute paths** when dispatching sub-agents, as they run in independent contexts.
- **Always read pipeline_state.json** after each sub-agent completes to verify the expected output was written.
- **pipeline_state.json is inside output_dir** — located at `{output_dir}/pipeline_state.json`.
- **File-based storage** — descriptions, suggestions, images, and code are stored as separate files. Only relative file paths are stored in `pipeline_state.json`. To read content, join `output_dir` + relative path.
- **For plot tasks**, the visualizer agent generates matplotlib code. If code execution fails, the critic will detect the failure and provide a revised description.
- **${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}** refers to the root directory of this plugin (i.e., the directory containing `.claude-plugin/`).
