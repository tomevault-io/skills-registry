# FlowSpec Architect (Web / Chrome)

Same three workflows as `architect`, but uses Chrome browser tools instead of MCP — for users without the desktop app.

**Core pattern:** Generate JSON locally in Claude Code -> inject into flowspec.app via Chrome tools -> iterate.

**Requires:** Claude in Chrome extension (`mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools).

---

## Prerequisites & Auth Check

1. Call `mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp` to find an existing flowspec.app tab.
2. If no tab exists:
   ```
   mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_create_mcp(url: "https://flowspec.app/projects")
   ```
   Navigate to https://flowspec.app/projects to browse and create projects from the dashboard, or go directly to https://flowspec.app/editor to open the canvas.
3. Use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__read_page` to check for auth state:
   - Look for `.signout-btn` or user email display to confirm signed-in state
   - If not signed in: instruct user to sign in manually at flowspec.app/sign-in
4. Wait for the dashboard or editor to fully load before proceeding.

## Interaction Model

| Action | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Generate JSON | Locally in Claude Code (same logic as `architect`) |
| Import JSON into project | `javascript_tool` with synthetic file injection (see [chrome-recipes.md](references/chrome-recipes.md)) |
| Export JSON from project | Click Export button via `javascript_tool`, then `read_page` |
| Create new project | Click "New Project" button via browser tools |
| Upload wireframe images | **User does manually** (browser file picker security) |
| Annotate screen regions | **User does manually** (drag-to-create is more ergonomic) |
| Auto-layout | Click toolbar button via browser tools |

**Fallback:** If any automation step fails, always provide manual instructions so the user can complete the step themselves.

## UC1: Wireframe -> Dataflow (Web)

### Step 1: Analyse wireframe images
Use Claude vision to examine wireframe images the user provides:
- Identify UI regions, data elements, forms, displays
- Note interactive elements and data relationships

### Step 2: Interview user
Ask about data types, sources, business logic, constraints — same as `architect` UC1 Step 4.

### Step 3: Build JSON spec
Assemble the JSON following the [v1.2.0 schema](../architect/references/json-schema.md).

### Step 4: Navigate to flowspec.app
Ensure we have a flowspec.app tab open (preferably at `/projects` for the dashboard):
```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp
```
If needed, navigate to https://flowspec.app/projects and create a new project from the dashboard, or go directly to https://flowspec.app/editor.

### Step 5: Import JSON
Use the synthetic file injection recipe from [chrome-recipes.md](references/chrome-recipes.md) to inject the JSON into the web app's import handler.

### Step 6: Guide wireframe upload
Instruct the user to:
1. Open the Screens section in the sidebar
2. Click "Create Screen" or use the image dropzone
3. Upload their wireframe image files
4. Name each screen

### Step 7: Guide region annotation
Instruct the user to:
1. Open a screen in the editor
2. Draw regions over the wireframe by clicking and dragging
3. Name each region and link data elements using the region panel

### Step 8: Export and iterate
Use browser tools to click "Export JSON" and read the result. Review and refine the spec, then re-import if needed.

---

## UC2: Codebase -> Dataflow (Web)

### Steps 1-7: Analyse locally
All codebase analysis happens locally in Claude Code — identical to `architect` UC2 Steps 1-7. See the architect skill's [codebase-analysis.md](references/codebase-analysis.md) methodology (which is the same reference used by the MCP-powered skill).

### Step 8: Create project and import
Navigate to https://flowspec.app/projects, create a new project from the dashboard, and import the JSON via Chrome tools.

### Step 9: Guide auto-layout
Instruct the user to click the Auto Layout button in the toolbar, or use `javascript_tool` to trigger it.

### Step 10: Export and validate
Export JSON via browser tools and validate the spec locally.

---

## UC3: Design New Screens (Web)

### Step 1: Obtain screen image
User designs in an external tool and provides screenshots, or starts with an empty screen.

### Step 2: Guide screen creation
Instruct the user to create screens and upload images via the web UI.

### Step 3: Build JSON for data architecture
Create dataPoints, components, transforms for the screen's data needs.

### Step 4: Import JSON
Import via Chrome tools using the synthetic file injection recipe.

### Step 5: Guide region annotation
Same as UC1 Step 7 — user annotates regions manually in the web UI.

---

## Limitations

- **Cannot automate authentication** — user must sign in manually
- **Image upload requires user interaction** — browser file picker security prevents automation
- **Region annotation is best done manually** — the web UI's drag-to-create is more ergonomic than coordinate-based automation
- **Large JSON files** may need manual file import as fallback — copy JSON to clipboard, user pastes or uses file dialog
- **DOM selectors may change** — if the web app UI updates, the Chrome recipes in `references/chrome-recipes.md` need updating
