# FlowSpec Architect (Orchestrated)

Creates FlowSpec projects — the reverse direction of `spec`/`wireframe`. This skill produces FlowSpec projects from wireframes, codebases, or design sessions using a **state-based orchestration workflow** with quality gates and interview loops.

**Core pattern:** INIT → ROUTE → GATHER → INTERVIEW → GENERATE → VALIDATE → REFINE → FINALIZE → **CONFIRM**

**Requires:** `flowspec_*` MCP tools (FlowSpec desktop app or standalone MCP server).

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke `/spec`, `/flowspec:spec`, or any implementation skill, write any implementation code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until:
1. The FlowSpec spec has been exported and presented to the user
2. The user has explicitly confirmed the spec is complete and correct
3. You have received unambiguous approval (e.g. "yes", "approved", "looks good", "go ahead")

This gate applies regardless of how simple the project seems. A tech spec markdown document is NOT confirmation — the user must review the actual FlowSpec project and approve it.
</HARD-GATE>

**Key Features:**
- Screen-by-screen interview loops with user confirmation
- Progressive JSON assembly (mini-specs → merged spec)
- Quality gates with enhanced analysis (naming, fuzzy duplicates, subgraphs)
- Semantic positioning with natural language commands
- Resume capability for interrupted workflows

---

## State Machine Overview

```
INIT (verify MCP, select project)
  ↓
ROUTE (detect use case: UC1/UC2/UC3)
  ↓
GATHER (collect inputs: images/codebase/designs)
  ↓
INTERVIEW (iterative user clarification, screen-by-screen)
  ↓
GENERATE (build JSON, progressive assembly)
  ↓
VALIDATE (enhanced analysis, quality checks)
  ↓
REFINE (layout, regions, smart positioning)
  ↓
FINALIZE (export JSON, generate tech spec)
  ↓
CONFIRM (user reviews & approves spec — HARD GATE before implementation)
```

**State Persistence:** Use Task system (TaskCreate/TaskUpdate) to track state and enable resume.

---

## Phase 1: INIT (Setup & Verification)

### Checkpoint 1.1: Verify MCP Connection
```
1. Call flowspec_list_projects()
2. If error → tell user to open FlowSpec desktop app or start MCP server
3. Display available projects (name, updated_at)
```

If MCP connection fails, use the 'Setup' button on the desktop dashboard to re-run the MCP configuration wizard.

> **Sync status:** After creating or modifying projects via MCP, check the SyncIndicator in the desktop dashboard toolbar to verify changes synced to the cloud. The indicator shows: green (synced), amber (syncing), red (error with retry option).

### Checkpoint 1.2: Project Selection
Ask user:
- **Create new project?** → `flowspec_create_project(name)`
- **Use existing project?** → user selects from list
- **Clone for safety?** → `flowspec_clone_project(projectId)` (recommended)

Save `projectId` to state.

### Checkpoint 1.3: State Transition
```
✓ Project ready → state: ROUTE
```

---

## Phase 2: ROUTE (Determine Use Case)

Analyse user input to determine workflow:

| User provides | Route |
|---------------|-------|
| Wireframe images (PNG/JPG) | **UC1: Wireframe → Dataflow** |
| Codebase path (directory) | **UC2: Codebase → Dataflow** |
| "Design screens" / "new project" | **UC3: Design New Screens** |
| JSON file | Direct import (skip to VALIDATE) |

Save `useCase` to state.

### Checkpoint 2.1: State Transition
```
✓ Use case determined → state: GATHER
```

---

## UC1: Wireframe → Dataflow (Interview-Driven)

**Goal:** Overlay wireframes with data architecture through screen-by-screen interviews.

### Phase 3: GATHER (Upload & Create Screens)

For each wireframe image:

**Step 3.1:** Upload image
```
result = flowspec_upload_image(filePath: "/path/to/wireframe.png")
→ { url, width, height, filename }
```

**Step 3.2:** Create screen
```
screen = flowspec_create_screen(
  projectId,
  name: "Login Page",
  imageUrl: result.url,
  imageWidth: result.width,
  imageHeight: result.height,
  imageFilename: result.filename
)
→ { id, name }
```

Save `screenId` for later region linking.

**Checkpoint 3.1:** All screens created
```
✓ Screens: ${screenIds.length} created → state: INTERVIEW
```

---

### Phase 4: INTERVIEW (Screen-by-Screen)

**Critical:** Interview each screen individually with user confirmation loops.

For each screen:

**Step 4.1:** Show wireframe via vision
- Display the wireframe image (use Read tool if needed)
- Identify distinct UI regions:
  - Headers, sidebars, navigation
  - Forms (input fields, buttons)
  - Data displays (tables, cards, charts)
  - Interactive elements (dropdowns, toggles)

**Step 4.2:** Region-by-region interview
For each identified region, ask user:

```
Q1: "What data elements are in this region?"
   → List field names, labels, values

Q2: "What are the data types?"
   → string, number, boolean, object, array

Q3: "Is this data captured (user input) or inferred (computed/fetched)?"
   → captured: form inputs, selections
   → inferred: calculations, API responses, database queries

Q4: "What constraints apply?"
   → required, enum, range, format, uniqueness

Q5: "What business logic affects this data?"
   → validations, calculations, workflows
```

**Step 4.3:** Build mini-spec for this screen
Assemble a mini-spec fragment:

```json
{
  "screenName": "Login Page",
  "dataPoints": [
    {
      "id": "email_input",
      "label": "Email Address",
      "type": "string",
      "source": "captured",
      "constraints": ["required", "email-format"]
    },
    {
      "id": "auth_token",
      "label": "Auth Token",
      "type": "string",
      "source": "inferred",
      "sourceDefinition": "API /auth/login response"
    }
  ],
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "login_page",
      "label": "Login Page",
      "displays": ["auth_token"],
      "captures": ["email_input", "password_input"]
    }
  ],
  "transforms": [
    {
      "id": "validate_email",
      "label": "Validate Email Format",
      "type": "validation",
      "inputs": ["email_input"],
      "outputs": ["email_valid"],
      "logic": {
        "type": "formula",
        "content": "regex match @example.com"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 4.4:** User confirmation checkpoint
```
ASK: "Screen '${screenName}' complete? [yes / no / refine]"

- yes → save mini-spec, move to next screen
- no → re-interview this screen (go back to Step 4.2)
- refine → ask specific clarifications, update mini-spec
```

**Checkpoint 4.1:** All screens interviewed
```
✓ Mini-specs collected: ${miniSpecs.length} → state: GENERATE
```

---

### Phase 5: GENERATE (JSON Assembly)

**Step 5.1:** Merge mini-specs
- Combine all screen mini-specs into full spec
- Deduplicate node IDs (same label + type → single node)
- Merge constraints and references

**Step 5.2:** Add cross-screen dataFlow edges
Trace data paths between screens — all edges use `flows-to` type:
- Component A captures → Component B displays (flows-to)
- Transform produces → Component displays (flows-to)
- Validation checks → DataPoint (flows-to)

**Step 5.3:** Add tables (if applicable)
If database tables or API endpoints were mentioned:
```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "id": "users_table",
      "label": "Users",
      "columns": [
        { "name": "email", "type": "string" },
        { "name": "created_at", "type": "string" }
      ],
      "sourceType": "database",
      "endpoint": "postgresql://users"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 5.4:** Add screens metadata
Include screen IDs from Phase 3 (regions added in REFINE):
```json
{
  "screens": [
    {
      "id": "screen_1",
      "name": "Login Page",
      "imageUrl": "https://...",
      "imageWidth": 1920,
      "imageHeight": 1080,
      "regions": []
    }
  ]
}
```

**Checkpoint 5.1:** JSON generated
```
✓ Full JSON spec assembled → state: VALIDATE
```

---

### Phase 6: VALIDATE (Quality Checks)

**Step 6.1:** Import spec with auto-layout
```
flowspec_import_json(
  projectId,
  json: fullSpec,
  autoLayout: true,
  layoutDirection: "TB"
)
```

**Step 6.2:** Run enhanced analysis
```
analysis = flowspec_analyse_project(projectId)
```

Check for:
- ✅ Orphan nodes (no edges)
- ✅ Exact duplicate labels
- ✅ **TBD / unresolved types** (DataPoints still set to `TBD`)
- ✅ **Naming convention violations** (mixed-case, special chars, inconsistent prefixes)
- ✅ **Fuzzy duplicates** (near matches via Levenshtein/cosine)
- ✅ **Unreachable subgraphs** (isolated clusters)
- ✅ **Consolidation opportunities** (same type + constraints)

**Step 6.3:** Quality gate decision
```
IF issues found:
  → Display analysis results
  → Ask user: "Fix automatically [auto] or manually [manual] or skip [skip]?"

  - auto → apply suggested fixes, re-import spec, re-validate
  - manual → prompt specific fixes, user edits, re-import
  - skip → proceed with warnings

  → state: REFINE (on success) or VALIDATE (retry)

ELSE:
  → state: REFINE
```

**Checkpoint 6.1:** Validation passed
```
✓ Quality checks passed → state: REFINE
```

---

### Phase 7: REFINE (Regions & Layout)

**Step 7.1:** Add regions to screens
For each screen and identified UI region from INTERVIEW phase:

```
flowspec_add_region(
  projectId,
  screenId,
  label: "Login Form",
  position: { x: 10, y: 20 },  # percentage (0-100)
  size: { width: 80, height: 60 },
  elementIds: [nodeId1, nodeId2]  # node IDs from canvas
)
```

**Position guidelines:**
- Use percentage coordinates (0-100) relative to wireframe
- Top-left = (0, 0), bottom-right = (100, 100)
- Typical sizes: header (100, 10), sidebar (20, 80), form (60, 40)

**Step 7.2:** Semantic layout (optional)
Offer smart positioning commands:

```
ASK: "Apply semantic layout? Examples:
- 'move auth nodes to top-right'
- 'arrange payment flow vertically on left'
- 'cluster validation transforms in bottom-left'
"

IF user provides command:
  flowspec_smart_layout(projectId, command)
```

**Step 7.3:** Manual layout adjustment (optional)
```
ASK: "Re-run auto-layout with different direction? [TB/BT/LR/RL/skip]"

IF user selects direction:
  flowspec_auto_layout(projectId, direction)
```

**Checkpoint 7.1:** Refinement complete
```
✓ Regions linked, layout optimized → state: FINALIZE
```

---

### Phase 7.5: DECISION TREES (Optional — Workflow Analysis)

If the project contains Transform nodes with `type: workflow` or `type: validation`, offer to generate decision trees for deeper analysis.

**Step 7.5.1:** Identify candidate transforms
```
Search for transforms with type "workflow" or "validation" in the project.
If none found → skip to Phase 8.
```

**Step 7.5.2:** Check for existing trees
```
flowspec_list_decision_trees(projectId)

If trees exist, offer analysis:
  flowspec_analyse_decision_tree(projectId, treeId)

If no trees exist, inform user they can generate them
from the FlowSpec UI (click tree icon on transform node).
```

**Step 7.5.3:** Include in tech spec
```
If decision trees exist, add a "Decision Trees" section to the
tech spec listing each tree with its root transform, depth,
branch count, and analysis summary.
```

**Checkpoint 7.5.1:** Decision tree review complete
```
✓ Decision trees reviewed → state: FINALIZE
```

---

### Phase 8: FINALIZE (Export & Tech Spec)

**Step 8.1:** Export final JSON
```
spec = flowspec_get_json(projectId)
```

Save to file: `{projectName}_flowspec.json`

**Step 8.2:** Generate tech spec markdown
Create structured implementation guide:

```markdown
# {Project Name} - Technical Specification

Generated: {timestamp}

## DataPoints (${dataPoints.length})

| Label | Type | Source | Constraints |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| Email Address | string | captured | required, email-format |
| Auth Token | string | inferred | - |

## Components (${components.length})

| Label | Displays | Captures | Wireframe |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Login Page | auth_token | email_input, password_input | Login Page |

## Transforms (${transforms.length})

| Label | Type | Inputs | Outputs | Logic |
|-------|------|--------|---------|-------|
| Validate Email | validation | email_input | email_valid | regex match |

## Tables (${tables.length})

| Label | Source | Columns |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Users | postgresql | email, created_at |

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Database Schema**: Create tables with listed columns and types
2. **API Contracts**: Build endpoints for inferred DataPoints (auth_token, etc.)
3. **Component Structure**: Implement UI components with listed displays/captures
4. **Validation Rules**: Apply constraints at both client and server
5. **Data Flow**: Follow edges for state management and data passing

## Quality Metrics

- Total nodes: ${totalNodes}
- Connected nodes: ${connectedNodes}
- Orphans: ${orphans}
- Duplicate labels: ${duplicates}
- Naming violations: ${namingViolations}
- Fuzzy duplicates: ${fuzzyDuplicates}

✅ Ready for implementation in Claude Code via `/spec` skill
```

**Step 8.3:** Completion summary
```
✅ FlowSpec project created — awaiting your review.

- Project: ${projectName}
- Screens: ${screenCount}
- Nodes: ${nodeCount} (DataPoints: ${dp}, Components: ${comp}, Transforms: ${tf})
- Edges: ${edgeCount}
- JSON: ${jsonFilePath}
- Tech Spec: ${specFilePath}
```

**Checkpoint 8.1:** Export complete
```
✓ FINALIZE done → state: CONFIRM
```

---

### Phase 9: CONFIRM (User Approval — HARD GATE)

**This phase is mandatory. Do NOT skip it.**

The FlowSpec spec must be reviewed and explicitly approved by the user before any implementation work begins. This prevents wasted effort from building against an incomplete or incorrect spec.

**Step 9.1:** Present the spec for review
```
ASK: "Please review the FlowSpec project in the desktop app (or the exported JSON).

Check:
1. All screens and data elements are represented
2. Data flows between components are correct
3. Transform logic matches your requirements
4. No missing or duplicate nodes

When you're satisfied, confirm and I'll proceed to implementation.
Is the spec complete and correct? [yes / needs changes]"
```

**Step 9.2:** Handle response
```
IF "needs changes":
  → Ask what needs changing
  → Apply changes via MCP tools
  → Re-export JSON
  → Re-run VALIDATE (quality checks)
  → Return to Step 9.1 (re-present for review)

IF "yes" / confirmed:
  → Record confirmation timestamp
  → state: DONE
```

**Step 9.3:** Post-confirmation next steps
```
✅ FlowSpec spec confirmed by user.

Ready for implementation. You can now:
1. Generate code with: /spec ${jsonFilePath}
2. Use the tech spec for manual implementation planning
```

**Checkpoint 9.1:** Spec confirmed
```
✓ User confirmed spec → state: DONE
```

> **IMPORTANT:** Only after reaching DONE with user confirmation should you invoke `/spec` or begin any implementation. If the user asks to implement during FINALIZE or earlier phases, remind them the spec needs review and confirmation first.

---

## UC2: Codebase → Dataflow (AST-Driven)

**Goal:** Reverse-engineer existing codebase into FlowSpec architecture.

See [codebase-analysis.md](references/codebase-analysis.md) and [ast-parsing.md](references/ast-parsing.md) for detailed AST parsing strategies.

### Phase 3: GATHER (Codebase Analysis)

**Step 3.1:** Scope assessment
```
1. Detect framework (check package.json, directory structure)
   - SvelteKit: src/routes/, +page.svelte
   - Next.js: pages/ or app/, React
   - Express: server.js, routes/
   - Remix: app/routes/

2. Count routes/pages (determine granularity)
   - < 10 pages → single JSON spec
   - 10-30 pages → split by domain (auth, admin, public)
   - > 30 pages → per-module JSON specs

3. Identify database/API access
   - SQL queries, ORM models
   - API fetch calls, endpoints
```

**Step 3.2:** Check for `@flowspec` annotations
```
1. Scan source files for @flowspec comments left by the codebase-indexer skill:
   grep -r "// @flowspec" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.svelte" --include="*.jsx"

2. IF annotations found:
   - Parse each: // @flowspec dp-name: type, source, constraints
   - Build initial node list from annotations (already validated by indexer)
   - Report: "Found ${count} pre-indexed elements in ${fileCount} files"
   - Use these as the BASE for the spec — skip re-discovering them in INTERVIEW

3. IF no annotations found:
   - Proceed with full AST parsing in INTERVIEW phase
```

> **Why check annotations?** The `/flowspec:annotate` skill (codebase-indexer) may have already analysed this codebase and left `@flowspec` comments marking datapoints, components, transforms, and edges. Using these avoids duplicate work and ensures consistency with prior analysis.

**Step 3.3:** Check existing specs
```
projects = flowspec_list_projects()
existingNodes = flowspec_search_nodes(query: "codebase-relevant-term")

IF existing project found:
  ASK: "Update existing project or create new?"
```

**Checkpoint 3.1:** Scope defined
```
✓ Framework: ${framework}, Routes: ${routeCount}, Annotations: ${annotationCount} → state: INTERVIEW
```

---

### Phase 4: INTERVIEW (AST Guidance)

**Step 4.1:** AST parsing strategy
Explain to user what will be analysed:

```
"I'll parse your ${framework} codebase using AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis:

1. **Type Definitions** → DataPoints
   - Interfaces, types, Zod schemas
   - Extract properties, types, constraints

2. **Routes/Pages** → Components
   - Each route file → one Component
   - Identify load functions (data fetching)
   - Identify form actions (data capture)

3. **Utilities** → Transforms
   - Functions in lib/utils, lib/services
   - Calculate, validate, workflow logic

4. **Data Flow** → Edges
   - Trace imports, function calls
   - Follow data dependencies

Is this approach okay? [yes / customize]"
```

**Step 4.2:** AST parsing execution
Use AST parsing techniques from [ast-parsing.md](references/ast-parsing.md):

- **TypeScript:** `typescript` compiler API
- **Svelte:** `svelte/compiler` + regex for runes
- **React:** `@babel/parser` + `@babel/traverse`

**Step 4.3:** Progressive mini-spec generation
For each module/route:
1. Parse file → extract entities
2. Build mini-spec fragment
3. **User confirmation:** "Module '${moduleName}' mapped. Correct? [yes/no/refine]"
4. Save mini-spec

**Checkpoint 4.1:** All modules parsed
```
✓ Mini-specs: ${miniSpecs.length} → state: GENERATE
```

---

### Phase 5-8: Same as UC1
Follow GENERATE → VALIDATE → REFINE → FINALIZE phases.

**Additional Step in REFINE (UC2-specific):**
```
ASK: "Capture screenshots of running app for screen overlay? [yes/no]"

IF yes:
  - User provides localhost URL or deployed URL
  - Use Playwright capture (if P1 tool available):
    flowspec_capture_screen(url, selector, viewport)
  - Or user uploads screenshots manually:
    flowspec_upload_image(filePath)

  - Create screens + add regions (same as UC1 Phase 7)
```

---

## UC3: Design New Screens (Collaborative)

**Goal:** Design new screens from scratch or extend existing project.

### Phase 3: GATHER (Design Input)

**Step 3.1:** Obtain screen design
```
ASK: "How would you like to design the screen?
1. Upload image from Figma/Sketch/Pencil
2. Start with blank screen (text description)
3. Use existing screen as template
"
```

**Step 3.2:** Upload or create
- **If image:** Same as UC1 Phase 3 (upload → create screen)
- **If blank:** Skip image, create screen with placeholder
- **If template:** Clone existing screen

**Checkpoint 3.1:** Screen created
```
✓ Screen: ${screenName} → state: INTERVIEW
```

---

### Phase 4: INTERVIEW (Collaborative Design)

**Step 4.1:** Region definition
Walk through screen with user:

```
"Let's define UI regions for '${screenName}':

For each region (header, form, table, sidebar, etc.):
1. Region name: _____
2. Position (x%, y%): _____, _____
3. Size (width%, height%): _____, _____
4. Data elements: [list]
5. Interactions: [buttons, links, inputs]
"
```

**Step 4.2:** Data element specification
For each data element in region:
```
Q1: Label? → _____
Q2: Type? → string/number/boolean/object/array
Q3: Source? → captured/inferred
Q4: Constraints? → required, enum, range, format
Q5: Related transforms? → validation, calculation, workflow
```

**Step 4.3:** Build mini-spec
Same as UC1 Phase 4 Step 4.3.

**Step 4.4:** Confirmation
```
ASK: "Screen design complete? [yes/no/add-more-regions]"
```

**Checkpoint 4.1:** Design complete
```
✓ Regions defined → state: GENERATE
```

---

### Phase 5-8: Same as UC1
Follow GENERATE → VALIDATE → REFINE → FINALIZE phases.

**Merge mode in GENERATE (UC3-specific):**
```
IF extending existing project:
  flowspec_import_json(projectId, json: miniSpec, merge: true)
  # Merges new nodes with existing, preserves structure
```

---

## Quality Gate Checklist

Run at **every VALIDATE checkpoint**:

```yaml
VALIDATE_CHECKLIST:
  - orphans.length === 0
    → Every node must have at least one edge

  - duplicates.length === 0
    → No exact duplicate labels

  - namingViolations.length === 0
    → Consistent naming convention (snake_case or camelCase, not mixed)

  - fuzzyDuplicates.length === 0
    → No near-duplicates (orderTotal vs order_total)

  - isolatedSubgraphs.length === 0
    → All nodes connected to main graph

  - capturedDataPoints.every(dp =>
      components.some(c => c.captures.includes(dp.id))
    )
    → Every captured DataPoint has capturing Component

  - inferredDataPoints.every(dp =>
      transforms.some(t => t.outputs.includes(dp.id)) ||
      components.some(c => c.displays.includes(dp.id))
    )
    → Every inferred DataPoint has producing Transform or fetching Component

IF any check fails:
  → state: REFINE
  → Display specific failures
  → Suggest fixes
  → Re-validate after fixes
```

---

## State Machine Error Recovery

**Interrupted workflow?** Resume from last checkpoint:

```
1. Check Task list for latest state
2. Retrieve saved context (projectId, useCase, miniSpecs, screenIds)
3. Resume from last completed phase:
   - INIT → start over (quick)
   - ROUTE → start over (quick)
   - GATHER → resume uploads/parsing
   - INTERVIEW → resume from last confirmed screen
   - GENERATE → regenerate from saved mini-specs
   - VALIDATE → re-run analysis
   - REFINE → continue layout/regions
   - FINALIZE → re-export
   - CONFIRM → re-present spec for user review
```

**State transition failure?**
```
IF state transition blocked:
  1. Display error details
  2. Suggest corrective action
  3. Allow manual state override (with confirmation)
  4. Offer rollback to previous checkpoint
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Semantic Positioning Examples
```
# Move specific node types to regions
"move all validation transforms to bottom-left"
"arrange payment flow vertically on right side"
"cluster auth-related nodes in top-right"

# Organize by relationship
"group captured DataPoints near their Components"
"stack transforms between their inputs and outputs"
```

### Progressive Refinement
```
1. Import initial JSON spec (coarse-grained)
2. Run analysis → identify gaps
3. Add missing nodes/edges incrementally
4. Re-import with merge: true
5. Validate again → iterate
```

### Multi-spec Projects
```
# For large codebases
1. Generate per-domain JSON specs (auth.json, admin.json, public.json)
2. Import each with merge: true
3. Deduplicate shared DataPoints
4. Consolidate cross-domain edges
```

## Success Criteria

A FlowSpec project is **complete** when:

✅ All phases reached CONFIRM state
✅ Quality gate passed (0 issues) — in strict mode, aim for zero errors and zero warnings
✅ JSON exported to file
✅ Tech spec generated
✅ Regions linked to screens (if wireframes used)
✅ Layout optimized (auto-layout or smart layout applied)
✅ **User explicitly confirmed the spec is correct** (HARD GATE)

**Output artifacts:**
- `${projectName}_flowspec.json` (importable spec)
- `${projectName}_tech_spec.md` (implementation guide)
- FlowSpec project (viewable in desktop app)

**Next step:** Only after user confirmation → `/spec ${projectName}_flowspec.json`
