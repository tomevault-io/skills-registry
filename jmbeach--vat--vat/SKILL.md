description: Manage a VAT backlog — assign IDs to new bullets (sync), claim tasks (start), block/unblock, mark done, and read/write project & user config. Use whenever the user says "vat sync", "claim foo-7k2", "mark X done", "ID that bullet", "extract notes", or otherwise asks for any operation on `backlog/backlog.md`, `backlog/items/`, `backlog/vat.toml`, `backlog/.used-ids`, or `~/.config/vat/config.toml`. First-class implementation — delegates to the installed `vat` binary when present, and otherwise operates the backlog zero-install with only file edits and git; when the backlog is its own git repo it claims tasks atomically against the shared remote. Use when this capability is needed.

# VAT skill

VAT (Versioned Addressable Tasks) is a tiny per-project backlog tool. State is plain markdown in the repo. This skill is a first-class implementation — it performs the same operations as the Rust binary, and unlike the binary it needs no install, so a remote agent can operate a backlog with only file edits and `git`. **When the `vat` binary is installed, the skill delegates each operation to it** rather than editing files by hand; the prose procedures below are the fallback for when the binary is absent (see [§ Binary-first delegation](#binary-first-delegation)). When the backlog is its own git repository, the skill claims tasks atomically against the shared remote (see [§ Nested-repo backlogs](#nested-repo-backlogs-atomic-claim-loop)) — and it owns that git loop whether the mutation came from the binary or the prose path, because the binary is git-agnostic.

## Invocation

The user's request is: **$ARGUMENTS**

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, the request is in the surrounding conversation (e.g., the user said "claim foo-7k2" or hand-edited `backlog/backlog.md` and asked you to tidy it). Map the request to one of the procedures below.

## What VAT is

A backlog file at `backlog/backlog.md` holds a flat list of `-` bullets. The user jots bullets as they think of them, then runs `vat sync` to assign each bullet a short stable ID (`foo-7k2`) and move any indented notes into `backlog/items/<id>.md`. Once a bullet has an ID, it's *addressable*: `vat start foo-7k2` claims it, `vat done foo-7k2` removes it. Concurrency across collaborators is delegated to git merge.

Files VAT owns:

```
backlog/
  backlog.md          # flat list of bullets (canonical state)
  vat.toml            # project config — project.id (3-char prefix)
  .used-ids           # newline-delimited tombstone list of every id ever issued
  README.md           # one-shot human explainer (written by `vat init` only)
  items/
    <id>.md           # per-task notes (only when notes exist)
~/.config/vat/config.toml   # user config — user.name (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vat/config.toml)
```

Nothing outside this set is ever written.

## When to invoke

- `vat sync` / "sync the backlog" / "assign IDs to new bullets" / "extract notes for that bullet"
- `vat start <id>` / "claim foo-7k2" / "I'll take foo-7k2"
- `vat block <id> <blocker-id>` / `vat unblock <id>`
- `vat done <id>` / "mark foo-7k2 done"
- `vat init [<prefix>]` / "set up vat in this repo"
- `vat config get|set <key> [<value>]`

If the user hand-edited `backlog/backlog.md` and asks you to "tidy" or "commit" it, run `sync` first.

## Binary-first delegation

VAT ships as both a Rust binary and this prose skill (HLD § Implementations). When the `vat` binary is installed it is the authoritative mutation engine, so the skill **delegates to it** instead of editing files by hand. The prose § Procedures are the fallback for when the binary is absent — a fresh remote container with no `cargo` and no release binary, which is the skill's reason for existing.

**Decision — evaluate once, before performing any requested operation.** Test whether the binary is on `PATH`:

```
command -v vat
```

- **Found** → **delegate**: perform the operation by running the matching `vat <command>` (table below) and report the binary's result — its stdout/stderr, with a non-zero exit surfaced as the error. Because the binary implements the same `FMT-*`/`SYNC-*`/`CMD-*` specs, the resulting backlog mutation is byte-for-byte equivalent to the prose procedure.
- **Not found** → **fall back**: execute the prose procedure for the command exactly as written below. This is the skill's prior behavior, unchanged.

**Command mapping.** The requested operation maps to exactly one binary invocation:

| Requested operation | Binary invocation |
|---|---|
| `sync` | `vat sync` |
| `start <id>` | `vat start <id>` |
| `block <id> <blocker-id>` | `vat block <id> <blocker-id>` |
| `unblock <id>` | `vat unblock <id>` |
| `done <id>` | `vat done <id>` |
| `init [<prefix>]` | `vat init [<prefix>]` |
| `config get <key>` | `vat config get <key>` |
| `config set <key> <value>` | `vat config set <key> <value>` |

**Nested-repo backlogs: the skill still owns git.** The binary is git-agnostic — it mutates the markdown and never fetches, commits, or pushes (HLD Decision #1). So delegation replaces **only the local file-mutation step**; nested-repo detection (§ Nested-repo backlogs), the atomicity guard, the atomic claim loop, the terminal-precondition checks, and the commit/push are still the skill's, exactly as for the prose path. Concretely:

- **Ordinary backlog** (no `backlog/.git`) → run `vat <command>` directly; no git.
- **Nested-repo backlog** (`backlog/.git` present) → run the claim loop unchanged, but wherever the prose path would mutate files locally — the loop's **mutate** step, and the guard's **local-edit-only fallback** — run `vat <command>` instead. The skill still evaluates terminal preconditions and drives `fetch`/`reset`/`commit`/`push`; the binary never runs git.

Everything downstream of this decision — the file boundary, exit-code semantics, and output wording — is identical whether the mutation came from the binary or from the prose path.

## File formats

### `backlog/backlog.md`

**Optional YAML frontmatter** at the very top, delimited by lines that consist solely of `---`:

```
---
version: 1
---
```

- `version` (integer): schema major version. `vat init` writes `1`. If the file's `version` exceeds `1`, abort every command with: `backlog file is version <N>; this skill supports up to version 1. Please upgrade vat.`
- Missing/empty frontmatter is treated as version 1.
- Unknown frontmatter keys are preserved on rewrite.

**Body regions.** After any frontmatter, the body has two regions separated by the **first** standalone `---` line (the line consists solely of `---`, optionally surrounded by whitespace). Other CommonMark thematic-break forms (`***`, `___`) are NOT recognized.

- **Parsed region**: above the separator. VAT reads, mutates, and writes only this region.
- **Freeform region**: from the separator onward (including the separator line itself). Preserve byte-for-byte.
- If no separator exists, the entire file is the parsed region.

**Parsed region grammar.** A preamble (any content — blank lines, headings, paragraphs — before the first bullet) followed by a sequence of task entries.

A **task entry** is:
1. A **bullet line**: starts at column 0 with `- ` (hyphen + single space).
2. Optional **note lines**: any subsequent lines that aren't a bullet line, up to the next bullet at column 0 or end of parsed region.

Only `-` is a bullet marker. Lines starting with `*` or `+` are notes (or preamble if no bullet has appeared yet). A paragraph at column 0 between two bullets attaches to the *first* bullet, not the second.

Preamble is preserved byte-for-byte and emitted at the top of the parsed region on rewrite.

### Bullet line canonical form

```
- [<id>] [in-progress] [by:<name>] [blocked-by:<id>] <title>
```

- `[<id>]` — required after `vat sync`. Format `<project>-<suffix>`: 3-char alphanumeric prefix from `vat.toml` (letters + digits) + `-` + 3 chars Crockford base32 suffix. Pre-sync, may be absent.
- `[in-progress]` — literal, optional.
- `[by:<name>]` — `<name>` matches `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+`. Optional.
- `[blocked-by:<id>]` — `<id>` matches the project ID format. Optional. Multiple `[blocked-by:...]` markers not supported in v1; preserve only the first.
- `<title>` — rest of the line, trimmed. Required, non-empty. When the bullet has a corresponding `backlog/items/<id>.md`, the title ends with the literal suffix ` (see ./items/<id>.md)` (single leading space, `./` prefix). The suffix is part of the title — round-tripped verbatim, managed by `vat sync`. NOT a marker.

Markers are always front-loaded in the order shown. `vat sync` normalizes order and spacing; other commands write markers in canonical position directly.

**Bullet parsing rules:**
- Markers matched left-to-right. As soon as the parser hits a `[...]` token that doesn't match a known marker pattern, the rest of the line is the title.
- Unknown bracketed tokens at the front are part of the title (so `- [TODO] thing` keeps `[TODO]` in the title).
- Whitespace between markers normalized to a single space on serialize. Trailing whitespace stripped.
- Empty bullet (`-` with nothing after) → warning, leave line untouched, skip the entry.

**Notes** are the lines between a bullet and the next bullet (or end of parsed region). On `vat sync`, notes are extracted into `backlog/items/<id>.md` and the bullet collapses to one line.

### `backlog/items/<id>.md`

```
---
id: <full-id>
---

<body>
```

- Frontmatter `id` MUST equal the filename stem (not validated on append — filename is the source of truth).
- Body is the verbatim notes, with the minimum common leading whitespace stripped, leading/trailing blank lines trimmed.
- On re-sync with new notes appended: append a single blank line, then the new notes (indentation-stripping applied to the new notes alone). Frontmatter untouched.
- Created lazily; deleted on `vat done`.

### `backlog/.used-ids`

Plain text, newline-delimited, one full ID per line (e.g., `foo-7k2`). Append-order. No comments or blank lines. Dedup on read. Append on every new ID assignment and on every `vat done`. If missing, treat as empty.

### `backlog/vat.toml`

```toml
[project]
id = "foo"   # exactly 3 ASCII alphanumeric characters (letters + digits)
```

- `project.id` is required. Validate on every command; missing/invalid is a hard error pointing at `vat init`.
- Preserve unknown sections/keys on rewrite.

### `~/.config/vat/config.toml`

```toml
[user]
name = "jared"
```

- Path: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vat/config.toml` if set, else `~/.config/vat/config.toml`.
- `user.name` is optional in the file; commands that require it (`vat start`) error with a pointer to `vat config set user.name <name>`.

## ID alphabets

An ID is `<prefix>-<suffix>`, and the two segments use **different** validators:

**Suffix — Crockford base32.** `0123456789abcdefghjkmnpqrstvwxyz` — 32 chars, no `i`/`l`/`o`/`u`. The auto-generated suffix is restricted to this set for readability (no ambiguous glyphs). Inputs accepted in either case; everything VAT writes is lowercase. Reject any character outside the alphabet, including ambiguous `I`/`L`/`O`/`U`; do NOT silently fold `I/L → 1` or `O → 0` per Crockford's lenient decoder hint — for a short suffix, a hard error pointing at the bad character is more helpful than a quiet rewrite.

**Prefix — alphanumeric.** The user-chosen `project.id` prefix accepts any 3 ASCII alphanumeric characters (letters `a`–`z` case-insensitive, digits `0`–`9`), so natural choices like `lib`, `ui0`, `io`, `sql` are allowed — the Crockford `i`/`l`/`o`/`u` exclusion does **not** apply to the prefix, since it is a one-time human choice, not a generated value. Still reject the `-` separator, whitespace, and `[`/`]` brackets so `[<prefix>-<suffix>]` tokens keep parsing. Stored lowercase.

VAT never decodes either segment to bytes — IDs are opaque tokens.

## Common machinery

Before reading `backlog/backlog.md`:

1. Detect optional YAML frontmatter at the very top.
2. If `version > 1`, abort with no writes.
3. Split body at the first standalone `---` line (after frontmatter) into parsed / freeform regions.
4. Parse parsed region into preamble + entries.

All writes are whole-file rewrites. Normalize CRLF → `\n` on read. Output always ends with a single trailing `\n`.

All-or-nothing: if any error occurs during parsing/ID-generation/validation, no files are mutated.

## Nested-repo backlogs (atomic claim loop)

VAT's state is plain markdown, so normally you just edit files and leave git to the human (exactly what the binary does). But a `backlog/` is sometimes its **own git repository** — a submodule, or a standalone clone an agent pulled — and then an autonomous agent has no human to commit, push, and resolve a rejected push. So when you detect a nested-repo backlog, **you** drive git: claim tasks against the shared backlog remote with a first-push-wins loop.

**Detection.** Before running any *mutating* command (`sync`, `start`, `block`, `unblock`, `done`, `config set project.id`), test for `backlog/.git`:

- **Absent** → ordinary backlog. Apply the change in place using the binary if installed (§ Binary-first delegation), and run no git.
- **Present** (a directory, or a *file* in the submodule/worktree case) → nested-repo backlog. Run the command through the machinery below. **All `git` runs from inside `backlog/`** (`git -C backlog ...`).

Non-mutating commands (`config get`, and `init`, which runs before `backlog/` exists) never run git, regardless. The **claim-loop commands** are `sync`, `start`, `block`, `unblock`, `done`; `config set project.id` is handled separately (single push — end of this section).

### The atomicity guard (evaluate once, at entry)

The loop's `git reset --hard` is destructive, so it may only run when nothing inherited would be lost. From inside `backlog/`:

```
git status --porcelain                  # any output → tree is dirty
git fetch                               # updates the remote-tracking branch @{u}
git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD @{u}  # exit 0 → HEAD is an ancestor of upstream
```

- **Clean AND synced** (no porcelain output AND `merge-base` exit 0) → run the loop. **Reuse this `fetch`** as the loop's first refresh — don't fetch twice.
- **Dirty OR ahead** (porcelain output, or `merge-base` exit 1 = local commits the remote lacks) → **local-edit-only fallback**: make the change on disk exactly as for an ordinary backlog (§ Binary-first delegation), do **no** commit/reset/push, and say so — e.g. `started foo-7k2 (not pushed; backlog/ has uncommitted changes)` or `... (not pushed; backlog/ has unpushed local commits)`. Never touch inherited in-flight work; the user syncs that batch themselves.
- **`@{u}` does not resolve** (no upstream configured, or detached HEAD) → **fail fast** with the raw git error; mutate nothing. A nested-repo backlog with no wired remote is a misconfiguration to surface, not to treat as ordinary.
- **`git fetch` fails** (unreachable remote, auth) → **fail fast** with the raw git error; mutate nothing.

Why clean-**and**-synced, not just clean: a clean tree can still sit on an unpushed local commit that `reset --hard` would destroy. You only ever commit *inside* the loop and immediately push it (or reset it away on contention), so any commit already present at entry is foreign work and must be preserved.

### The loop (claim-loop commands)

Constants: `MAX = 5` attempts; backoff `sleep = 0.5 * 2^(attempt-1)` seconds plus random jitter in `[0, 0.5]s` — i.e. the waits before attempts 2..5 are ≈ 0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s (`attempt` is incremented before the sleep, so the first retry uses `attempt = 1`). With the guard satisfied, from inside `backlog/`:

```
attempt = 0
loop:
  1. refresh:  git fetch (the entry fetch counts as the first), then git reset --hard @{u}
  2. re-read:  re-parse the now-fresh backlog files (§ Common machinery)
  3. terminal precondition (per command — see table):
        success → report success, stop (no mutation, no push)
        loss    → report the loss, stop
        none    → continue
  4. decide + mutate:  run the command's § Procedure against the fresh state,
                       using the binary if it was found at the top of this operation
                       (§ Binary-first delegation); if the binary exits non-zero →
                       surface its stdout/stderr as the error, stop (no commit,
                       no push, no retry)
                       (normal local validation still applies — e.g. unknown id aborts this way)
  5. no-op check:  if the tree is now byte-identical to fresh state → report `unchanged`, stop
  6. commit:   git add -A && git commit -m "<fixed message>"
  7. push:     git push
        ok                           → report success, stop          (first push wins)
        rejected / non-fast-forward  → contention: git reset --hard @{u}; attempt += 1;
                                        if attempt >= MAX → report lost race (exit 1), stop;
                                        else sleep backoff, loop
        any other failure            → fail fast: raw git error (exit 1), stop
```

**First push wins.** On a `rejected` / `non-fast-forward` push the loser does **not** merge or rebase — it resets to the winner and re-runs the whole decision (steps 1–7) on fresh state. So there's never a textual merge conflict, not even a false one between two unrelated tasks edited on nearby lines.

**Fail fast, don't mislead.** Only `rejected` / `non-fast-forward` is contention. Network / auth / quota / unreachable failures surface the raw git error immediately (exit 1) and do **not** consume a retry — a "lost race" report must mean a real lost race.

**Terminal preconditions** (checked on fresh state, step 3):

| Command | On fresh state | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `start <id>` | already claimed by anyone (`[by:...]` or `[in-progress]`) | loss → `lost claim: <id> already claimed by <name>` |
| `done <id>` | absent **and** `<id>` in `.used-ids` | success → already done |
| `done <id>` | absent **and** `<id>` **not** in `.used-ids` | error → `unknown id: <id>` |
| `unblock <id>` | no `[blocked-by:...]` | success (no-op) |
| `block <id> <b>` | already `[blocked-by:<b>]` (same blocker) | success (no-op) |
| `sync` | — | none — always proceed |

There is no "already mine, success" case for `start`: a rejected claim is reset away before re-read, so any claim seen on fresh state is someone else's (or your own from a *prior* completed `start`, which is still a refusal). Terminal preconditions end the loop early; they don't replace normal validation — a fresh-state `unknown id` / `unknown blocker` still aborts (exit 1, no retry).

**Fixed commit messages** (auditable remote history):

| Command | Commit message |
|---|---|
| `sync` | `vat sync` |
| `start <id>` | `vat start <id>` |
| `block <id> <b>` | `vat block <id> <b>` |
| `unblock <id>` | `vat unblock <id>` |
| `done <id>` | `vat done <id>` |

`sync` re-run after contention recomputes ids against the refreshed `backlog.md` + `.used-ids`; ids from a discarded attempt impose no constraint (they were never pushed).

### `config set project.id` (single push, no loop)

Concurrent re-prefixing isn't a real scenario, and re-deciding a re-prefix against a winner's fresh state would be destructive — so this command does **not** loop. With the guard satisfied: edit `vat.toml` (by running `vat config set project.id <v>` when the binary is installed, otherwise the prose procedure) → `git commit -m "vat config set project.id <v>"` → `git push`, **once**. No refresh, no reset, no re-decide. A rejected or failed push fails fast with the raw git error (exit 1); the user pulls and re-runs. If `project.id` already equals `<v>`, succeed without writing, committing, or pushing. (Dirty-or-ahead still falls back to local-edit-only, like any mutating command.)

## Procedures

These prose procedures are the **fallback path**: follow them directly when the `vat` binary is not installed (§ Binary-first delegation). When the binary *is* installed, you run `vat <command>` instead of the steps below — but the binary produces the same file state, so these procedures remain the authoritative description of what each command does.

### `vat sync`

The only command that mutates the structure of `backlog.md`. Idempotent.

1. Load `backlog/vat.toml`; require `project.id`. Missing/invalid → abort with init pointer.
2. Read `backlog.md` (missing → abort with init pointer). Run version check. Split frontmatter / parsed / freeform.
3. Parse parsed region into preamble + entries.
4. Read `.used-ids` (missing → empty). Build `used` = those ids ∪ every id present on a bullet in the parsed region.
5. Two bullets sharing the same `[id]` → abort with no writes; message points at the offending lines.
6. For each entry in order:
   - **No `[id]`**: generate `<project.id>-<3 random Crockford chars>`; retry while in `used`; cap 100 retries (else abort with no writes). Add to `used` and to a `to_append` list. Insert `[id]` at the front of the bullet.
   - **`[id]` with prefix ≠ `project.id`**: warn, leave marker as-is.
   - Normalize markers to canonical order with single-space separators.
   - **Notes handling**:
     - Strip the minimum common leading whitespace across note lines; trim leading/trailing blank lines.
     - If the result is non-empty:
       - If `backlog/items/<id>.md` does not exist: create it with frontmatter `---\nid: <id>\n---\n` then a blank line then the stripped notes then a trailing newline.
       - Else: append `\n<stripped>\n` to the existing body, leaving frontmatter untouched.
     - Drop the note lines from the entry regardless (so the entry serializes as one line).
     - If notes were only whitespace, drop them but do NOT create or modify any item file.
   - **Pointer suffix**:
     - If `backlog/items/<id>.md` exists (pre-existing or just written) and the title doesn't already end with ` (see ./items/<id>.md)`, append it.
     - If the file does NOT exist, do not add the suffix and do not strip an existing one. Sync never removes information.
7. Serialize: original frontmatter (preserve unknown keys verbatim) + preamble (verbatim) + one normalized line per entry + freeform region (verbatim, including the `---` separator line).
8. **No-op**: if serialized output is byte-identical to input, skip the write to `backlog.md`.
9. Otherwise write `backlog.md`. Then append each new id (from `to_append`) on its own line to `.used-ids`. Create `backlog/items/` lazily if any item-file write needs it.

**Idempotence.** After one successful sync: every entry has an `[id]`; no entry has note lines; markers are canonical; assigned ids are in `.used-ids`; entries whose id has an item file end with the pointer suffix. A second run finds nothing to do and skips the write.

**Edge behaviors:**
- Bullet has id, no notes → pass-through (only marker reorder).
- Bullet has id, with notes → append to existing item file (or create); collapse to one line.
- Bullet without id, with notes → assign id; create item file.
- Bullet has id but its `(see ./items/<id>.md)` suffix is missing/hand-edited away → re-append (only if the item file exists).
- Item file does not exist but a `(see ...)` suffix is present (user manually deleted file) → leave suffix alone.
- Empty bullet (`-` alone) → warn, skip, do NOT consume the lines after it as notes.
- Item file exists but no bullet references it → leave alone (no GC in v1).
- Two bullets with the same id → abort, no writes.
- No `---` separator → entire file is parsed; do NOT add one.
- Dangling `[blocked-by:X]` whose X isn't present → leave alone. (Only `vat done` strips blockers.)
- Trailing whitespace on bullet lines → stripped on serialize.

### `vat start <id>`

1. Load user config. Require `user.name`. If missing: `set user.name first: vat config set user.name <name>`.
2. Run version check; locate the entry by `[id]`. Not found → `unknown id: <id>`.
3. If bullet has `[in-progress]` or `[by:...]` → `<id> already claimed by <name>` (or `... already in progress` if only `[in-progress]` present from a hand-edit). Both forms count as "claimed".
4. Insert `[in-progress]` and `[by:<user.name>]` in canonical position.
5. Re-serialize the parsed region and write.

### `vat block <id> <blocker-id>`

1. Locate entry. Refuse if `id == blocker-id`.
2. `<blocker-id>` must appear somewhere in the parsed region (any bullet). Else `unknown blocker: <blocker-id>`.
3. Already `[blocked-by:<blocker-id>]` (same blocker) → no-op success.
4. Existing `[blocked-by:<other>]` → replace.
5. Else insert in canonical position. Write.

(v1 supports a single blocker per task. No cycle detection.)

### `vat unblock <id>`

1. Locate entry. If no `[blocked-by:...]`, no-op success (exit 0).
2. Strip the marker. Write.

### `vat done <id>`

1. Locate entry.
2. Remove the bullet line. If removing it would leave a double blank, also drop one of the surrounding blank lines.
3. If `backlog/items/<id>.md` exists, delete it.
4. Append `<id>` to `.used-ids` if not already present.
5. Walk remaining entries; strip `[blocked-by:<id>]` from any that reference this id. (Auto-unblock.)
6. Write `backlog.md`.

`vat done` on a blocked task is allowed (no warning).

### `vat init [<prefix>]`

1. If `backlog/` exists → `backlog/ already exists; vat is initialized`.
2. Resolve prefix: argument takes precedence; otherwise prompt the user.
3. Validate prefix: exactly 3 ASCII alphanumeric chars (letters + digits, case-insensitive); store lowercase.
4. Create `backlog/` and write:
   - `backlog/vat.toml` containing `[project]\nid = "<prefix>"\n`.
   - `backlog/backlog.md` containing only:
     ```
     ---
     version: 1
     ---
     ```
   - `backlog/.used-ids` empty.
   - `backlog/README.md` from the template below.

**`backlog/README.md` template** (substitute `<prefix>`):

```markdown
# Backlog

This directory is managed by [VAT](https://github.com/) (Versioned Addressable Tasks) — a tiny tool for capturing tasks as plain markdown.

## Files

- `backlog.md` — the flat list of tasks. Jot bullets here as you think of them.
- `vat.toml` — project config (the 3-char ID prefix for this repo: `<prefix>`).
- `.used-ids` — tombstone list of every ID ever issued. Committed. Don't hand-edit.
- `items/<id>.md` — per-task notes; created when a task has notes, deleted when the task is `done`.

## Workflow

1. Type new bullets into `backlog.md`:
   ```
   - rewrite the cache layer
       why: the LRU is thrashing on hot keys
   ```
2. Run `vat sync` to assign IDs and tuck notes into `items/<id>.md`.
3. Claim a task with `vat start <id>`. Mark it complete with `vat done <id>`.

This README is written once at init time. VAT never reads or rewrites it — feel free to edit or delete.
```

This README is written once at init and never read or rewritten by VAT after that.

### `vat config get <key>`

Supported keys: `user.name`, `project.id`. Print the value to stdout, or print nothing and exit non-zero if unset.

### `vat config set <key> <value>`

- `user.name`: writes to global config (creating `~/.config/vat/config.toml` and parent dirs as needed). Format `[user]\nname = "<value>"\n`. Preserve unknown sections/keys.
- `project.id`: writes to `backlog/vat.toml`. Validate (3 ASCII alphanumeric chars). **Refuse** if any id in `backlog.md` or `.used-ids` uses the old prefix — changing prefix mid-project would orphan ids. No `--force`. Users with a real need can edit `vat.toml` directly.
- Other keys → `unknown config key: <key>`.

## Files this skill is allowed to touch

Exactly these — never anything else:

- `backlog/backlog.md`
- `backlog/items/<id>.md`
- `backlog/items/` (created lazily)
- `backlog/.used-ids`
- `backlog/vat.toml`
- `backlog/README.md` (init only)
- `~/.config/vat/config.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vat/config.toml`)

## Output

- Success: one terse line, e.g.:
  - `assigned 3 ids: foo-7k2, foo-9hf, foo-b2x`
  - `started foo-7k2`
  - `done foo-7k2 (cleared 2 blockers)`
  - `unchanged` (sync no-op)
- Warnings (empty bullet, foreign-prefix id) — surface to the user but do not abort.
- Errors → terse message + no writes. Use the exact wording specified above where given (e.g., `unknown id: <id>`).

## Exit-code semantics (for parity with the binary)

- `0` — success (including no-op / `unchanged` cases, and a clean local-edit-only fallback).
- `1` — user-facing error (unknown id, missing config, validation failure) **and** every git failure in a nested-repo backlog: lost race after `MAX` attempts, a non-contention push/fetch failure (network, auth, quota, unreachable remote), or no configured upstream / detached HEAD. Carry the raw git message.
- `2` — internal error (file IO, parse failure that shouldn't happen).

Note: in a nested-repo backlog a *rejected / non-fast-forward* push is **not** an error — it's contention, handled by the loop's reset-and-retry, and only becomes a `1` (lost race) once `MAX` attempts are exhausted.
