# PRD Planner

Generate structured planning documents that optimize AI-assisted development by breaking work into discrete, context-efficient conversation threads.

## Core Principles

1. **Thread Isolation** - Each task is scoped for a single conversation to minimize context carryover
2. **Reasoning Economy** - Match model capability to task complexity (don't waste high reasoning on low tasks)
3. **Self-Contained Context** - Every thread has all information needed to execute without external reference
4. **Progressive Tracking** - Checklist format enables clear progress visibility and serves as context for subsequent threads
5. **Goal-Backwards Design** - Start from the end state and work backward to determine thread sequence

## PRD Creation Process

1. **Discuss phase (if needed)** - Clarify requirements before planning (see below)
2. **Define done** - Write the end state before any threads
3. **Work backwards** - Identify dependencies from goal to starting point
4. **Analyze complexity** - Identify discrete work units and assign reasoning levels
5. **Generate the PRD** - Use the template structure from [references/prd-template.md](references/prd-template.md)
6. **Assess risk** - Document blast radius and rollback plan
7. **Validate completeness** - Ensure each thread is self-contained
8. **Optionally emit an execution manifest** - For plans with 3+ threads, dependencies, or intended subagent execution, also produce a compact manifest using [references/execution-manifest-template.json](references/execution-manifest-template.json)

## Discuss Phase (Pre-Planning)

Before creating threads, run a discuss phase when ANY of these are true:
- Requirements are ambiguous or came from someone other than the executor
- Multiple valid approaches exist with significant tradeoffs
- The change touches unfamiliar parts of the codebase
- Novel problem domain you haven't solved before
- High-stakes change (production data, auth, payments)

### When to Skip Discuss Phase

Skip directly to planning when:
- User says "skip discuss" or "I know what I want"
- Requirements are crystal clear with specific acceptance criteria
- Following an established pattern with no decisions to make
- Small scope (1-2 threads, single service)

### Discuss Phase Questions

Ask these to surface assumptions:

1. **Success definition**: "What does done look like? How will you know this worked?"
2. **Constraints**: "Are there approaches that are off the table? Performance/cost/timeline limits?"
3. **Stakeholders**: "Who else touches this code or cares about this change?"
4. **Risk tolerance**: "What's the worst thing that could happen? How bad would that be?"
5. **Prior art**: "Has something similar been tried before? What happened?"

### Discuss Phase Output

```markdown
## Discuss Phase Summary

**Assumptions confirmed**:
- [What the user validated]

**Assumptions made** (user didn't specify):
- [What you're assuming - flag for review]

**Risks identified**:
- [What could go wrong]

**Approach selected**:
- [Brief description of chosen direction and why]

**Open questions** (to resolve during execution):
- [What still needs answers]
```

---

## Debug-First Pattern (Thread 0)

For bugs, performance issues, or unclear problems, insert an investigation thread BEFORE implementation threads.

### When to Use Thread 0

- Bug reports without clear reproduction steps
- Performance issues without profiling data
- Errors in production logs you haven't traced
- Feature requests that might already be partially implemented
- "It's broken" without specifics

### Thread 0 Template

```markdown
### Thread 0 — Investigation — Reasoning Effort: medium-high

- **Purpose**: Gather information and document findings. DO NOT fix anything.
- **Actions**:
  - Reproduce the issue (or document why it can't be reproduced)
  - Read relevant logs, trace code paths
  - Identify root cause or narrow down candidates
  - Document what you found
- **Reference material**: [logs, error messages, user reports]
- **Deliverables**: Investigation report with:
  - Steps to reproduce (if possible)
  - Root cause (confirmed or candidates)
  - Recommended fix approach
  - Files that will need changes
- **Reasoning effort**: Medium-High (Sonnet or Opus)
- **Output feeds**: Thread 1 design decisions

**Important**: Thread 0 produces a REPORT, not code. Implementation starts in Thread 1.
```

## Reasoning Level Guidelines

Assign reasoning levels based on task characteristics. See [references/reasoning-levels.md](references/reasoning-levels.md) for detailed guidance.

`Reasoning effort` is the canonical planning field. Vendor model names are only hints for the environment that will execute the thread.

| Level | Characteristics | Claude Hint | OpenAI Hint |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Minimal** | Procedural, well-documented, single-file | Haiku | GPT-5.4 low |
| **Low** | Clear patterns, limited decisions, 2-3 files | Haiku or Sonnet | GPT-5.4 low |
| **Medium** | Code comprehension, refactoring, integration | Sonnet | GPT-5.4 medium |
| **Medium-High** | Architecture decisions, test orchestration, investigation | Sonnet or Opus | GPT-5.4 high |
| **High** | Novel problems, system design, complex debugging | Opus | GPT-5.4 high |

### Context Volume Tag

In addition to reasoning level, every thread should be tagged with its **context volume** -- the estimated total size of reference material the executing agent must read. This drives model selection during execution.

| Tag | Meaning | Execution Implication |
|-----|---------|----------------------|
| **Light** (under 50KB) | Reads a few focused files | Any model handles this |
| **Heavy** (50-100KB) | Reads several reference docs or upstream deliverables | Prefer larger context model |
| **Synthesis** (over 100KB or reads all upstream deliverables) | Must hold entire prior work in context to integrate | **Require largest context model or execute in orchestrator session** |

**When to apply the Synthesis tag:** A thread is a synthesis thread if it reads 4+ upstream deliverables, integrates or reconciles prior work, or is the capstone/final thread in a multi-thread plan. Always flag these explicitly -- they are the most likely to fail when delegated to a standard-context agent.

Format in the PRD: append the context tag after reasoning effort, e.g.:
- `Reasoning effort: Medium (Sonnet) | Context: Light`
- `Reasoning effort: High (Opus) | Context: Synthesis`

---

## Thread Structure Requirements

Every thread in the PRD MUST include:

1. **Thread identifier** - Numbered for tracking (e.g., "Thread 3" or "Step 15")
2. **Purpose statement** - Clear goal in one sentence
3. **Actions with inline verification** - Specific work with verify steps (see below)
4. **Reference material** - File paths to read first (use `file.py:1` format for line hints)
5. **Deliverables** - Expected outputs
6. **Reasoning effort** - Vendor-neutral level with context volume tag

### Inline Verification (New Pattern)

Instead of listing validation targets at the end, embed verification after each action:

```markdown
- **Actions**:
  - Add `platform` column to posts table
    - *Verify*: `\d posts` shows platform column with TEXT type
  - Update Post ORM model with platform field
    - *Verify*: `python -c "from shared.db.models import Post; print(Post.platform)"`
  - Create Alembic migration
    - *Verify*: `alembic history` shows new migration at head
  - Run migration on dev database
    - *Verify*: `alembic current` matches head revision
```

**Why inline verify matters**: If step 2's verify fails, you stop before doing steps 3-4. Catches problems earlier.

### Optional Thread Fields (include when applicable)

- **Key decisions** - Choices with options and recommendations
- **Acceptance criteria** - Testable success metrics
- **Dependencies** - Prerequisite threads
- **Blocks** - Threads that depend on this one
- **Claude hint** - Suggested Claude model family for this thread
- **OpenAI hint** - Suggested OpenAI reasoning level or model tier for this thread
- **Ownership hint** - Suggested owner such as orchestrator, `worker`, or `explorer`
- **Output artifact** - File or artifact the thread should produce if execution tracking will be automated

---

## Optional Execution Manifest

When the plan is likely to be executed by `prd-executor`, emit a compact JSON manifest next to the PRD.

Use a manifest when any of these are true:

- 3 or more threads
- explicit dependencies between threads
- planned subagent delegation
- wave-based execution
- non-trivial verification or rollout

Do not emit a manifest for tiny 1-2 thread plans unless the user asks for it.

The PRD remains the human-readable source of truth. The manifest is only a machine-friendly execution view.

Use [references/execution-manifest-template.json](references/execution-manifest-template.json).

## PRD Document Structure

Use this structure for all PRDs. See [references/prd-template.md](references/prd-template.md) for full template.

```markdown
# [Feature/Project Name] Plan

## Objective
[1-2 sentence goal]

## Definition of Done
[End state written in present tense, as if already complete]

## Risk Assessment
[Blast radius, rollback complexity - see template]

## Current State Snapshot
[What exists today, pain points]

## Architecture Decisions
[Key choices made, with rationale]

## Sequential Thread Plan

### Thread 0 — Investigation — Reasoning Effort: medium-high
[If needed - for bugs/unclear problems]

### Thread 1 — [Name] — Reasoning Effort: [level] | Context: [Light/Heavy/Synthesis]
- **Purpose**: [goal]
- **Actions**:
  - [action 1]
    - *Verify*: [how to check it worked]
  - [action 2]
    - *Verify*: [check]
- **Reference material**: [file paths]
- **Deliverables**: [outputs]
- **Claude hint**: [Haiku/Sonnet/Opus or N/A]
- **OpenAI hint**: [GPT-5.4 low/medium/high or strongest available model]
- **Reasoning effort**: [level] | **Context volume**: [Light/Heavy/Synthesis]

### Thread 2 — [Name] — Reasoning Effort: [level] | Context: [Light/Heavy/Synthesis]
[...]

## Acceptance Criteria
[Overall success metrics]

## Completion Checklist
Thread 0 — Investigation — [ ] PENDING (if applicable)
Thread 1 — [Name] — [ ] PENDING
Thread 2 — [Name] — [ ] PENDING
[...]
```

When emitting a manifest, store it beside the PRD using a matching basename, for example:

- `docs/plans/feature-x-plan.md`
- `docs/plans/feature-x-plan.execution-manifest.json`

---

## Completion Log Format

When a thread is completed, the PRD should be updated with implementation details:

```markdown
### Thread 3 — [Name] — Reasoning Effort: medium

[thread details...]

**Completion Log — Thread 3** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-15)
- ✅ [What was implemented with specifics]
- ✅ [Files modified with line references]
- ✅ [Tests added/passed]
- ✅ [All verify steps passed]
- **Notes**: [Any deviations, decisions made, follow-ups identified]
- **Next**: Thread 4
```

---

## Instructing the Executor

Include these instructions in the PRD so that executing agents know how to work:

```markdown
## How to Execute Threads

1. Read this PRD fully before starting
2. Execute ONE thread per conversation
3. Start your thread by stating: "Executing Thread N: [Name]"
4. Read all reference material listed for the thread
5. For each action:
   a. Perform the action
   b. Run the verify step immediately
   c. If verify fails, stop and troubleshoot before continuing
6. Update the PRD with completion log before ending
7. State: "Thread N complete. Next: Thread N+1"
```

For plans intended for `prd-executor`, also include a delegation visibility block so the user can tell from terminal commentary when work is actually being delegated:

```markdown
## Delegation Visibility Rules

- Whenever you spawn a subagent, announce it in commentary with the thread number, agent type, and owned files or output artifact.
- When a subagent returns, announce that too and summarize what it produced.
- If no subagent is used for a thread, say that the orchestrator is handling it locally.
```

## Key Patterns from Effective PRDs

### Pattern: Decision Documentation

When threads involve choices, document options with recommendations:

```markdown
**Key Decision**: Sequence numbering
- **Option A**: Restart per platform (LinkedIn_1, LinkedIn_2; YouTube_1, YouTube_2) ✅ RECOMMENDED
- **Option B**: Continuous across platforms (LinkedIn_1, LinkedIn_2; YouTube_3, YouTube_4)
- **Rationale**: Option A keeps each platform's batch self-contained
```

### Pattern: Migration Safety

For changes affecting production systems:

```markdown
## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing records: [How handled]
- Transition period: [Strategy]

### Rollback Plan
1. [Step to revert]
2. [Verification after rollback]
```

### Pattern: Thread Dependencies

When threads must be executed in order:

```markdown
### Thread 5 — Database Migration — Reasoning Effort: low
- **Depends on**: Thread 4 (schema design must be finalized)
- **Blocks**: Threads 6, 7, 8 (all require new schema)
```

## Self-Contained Thread Checklist

Before finalizing a thread, verify:

- [ ] Can someone start a fresh conversation and execute this thread with ONLY the PRD?
- [ ] Are all file paths specified (not "the config file" but `config/settings.py:45`)?
- [ ] Is the reasoning level justified by the task complexity?
- [ ] Does each action have an inline verify step?
- [ ] Does the thread avoid scope creep (one focused outcome)?
