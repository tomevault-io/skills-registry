# Implement Mode

**Recommended model tier:** smart (opus) - this skill requires complex reasoning

Focused TDD implementation: make failing tests pass with minimal code.

## Purpose

This is the DEV stage of the SDLC pipeline. Tests already exist from the TEST stage. Your job is to write the minimal implementation that makes them pass.

## Prerequisites

Before starting:

- Tests exist and are failing (from TEST stage)
- Design/spec is available (from DESIGN stage)
- You know which files to create/modify

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Tests Exist and Fail

```bash
# Run the tests - they MUST fail initially
npm test -- path/to/feature.test.ts
# or
go test ./pkg/feature/...
```

**If tests pass**: The work is already done. Mark complete and move on.

**If tests don't exist**: This is wrong - go back to TEST stage.

### Step 2: Read the Tests

Understand what the tests expect:

- What functions/methods need to exist?
- What are the expected inputs and outputs?
- What edge cases are covered?

```bash
# For large test files, get the structure first
mcp__plugin_aide_aide__code_outline file="path/to/feature.test.ts"

# Then read specific test sections with offset/limit
Read path/to/feature.test.ts offset=<start> limit=<count>

# For small test files (<100 lines), reading the full file is fine
Read path/to/feature.test.ts
```

When implementing, use `code_outline` on adjacent/related source files to understand
their structure before reading them fully. This preserves context for the implementation work.

### Step 3: Check Design Decisions

Use `mcp__plugin_aide_aide__decision_get` with the feature topic to review decisions from DESIGN stage.
Use `mcp__plugin_aide_aide__decision_list` to see all project decisions.

### Step 4: Implement Incrementally

Write code to make tests pass **one at a time**:

1. Pick the simplest failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass it
3. Run tests
4. If passing, move to next test
5. If failing, fix before proceeding

```bash
# Run specific test
npm test -- --grep "should create user"
# or
go test -run TestCreateUser ./pkg/...
```

### Step 5: Backpressure Checkpoint (REQUIRED)

**You CANNOT proceed until ALL tests pass.**

```bash
# Full test run
npm test -- path/to/feature.test.ts
# or
go test -v ./pkg/feature/...
```

**BLOCKING RULE**: If any test fails:

1. Analyze the failure
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run tests
4. Repeat until ALL pass

**DO NOT skip failing tests. DO NOT proceed with red tests.**

### Step 6: Verify Build

```bash
# Ensure it compiles
npm run build
# or
go build ./...
```

### Step 7: Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: implement <feature> - tests passing"
```

## Rules

1. **Tests First**: Never write code without a failing test
2. **Minimal Code**: Only write what's needed to pass tests
3. **No Gold Plating**: Don't add features not covered by tests
4. **Red → Green**: Tests must fail before they pass
5. **Atomic Commits**: One logical change per commit
6. **No Skipping**: Every test must pass

## Common Patterns

### TypeScript/JavaScript

```typescript
// Read test expectations
describe("UserService", () => {
  it("should create user with email and name", async () => {
    const user = await service.createUser({
      email: "test@example.com",
      name: "Test",
    });
    expect(user.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(user.email).toBe("test@example.com");
  });
});

// Implement to match
export class UserService {
  async createUser(input: CreateUserInput): Promise<User> {
    return {
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      email: input.email,
      name: input.name,
      createdAt: new Date(),
    };
  }
}
```

### Go

```go
// Read test expectations
func TestCreateUser(t *testing.T) {
    svc := NewUserService()
    user, err := svc.CreateUser(context.Background(), CreateUserInput{
        Email: "test@example.com",
        Name:  "Test",
    })
    require.NoError(t, err)
    assert.NotEmpty(t, user.ID)
    assert.Equal(t, "test@example.com", user.Email)
}

// Implement to match
func (s *UserService) CreateUser(ctx context.Context, input CreateUserInput) (*User, error) {
    return &User{
        ID:        uuid.New().String(),
        Email:     input.Email,
        Name:      input.Name,
        CreatedAt: time.Now(),
    }, nil
}
```

## Failure Handling

### Test Won't Pass After Multiple Attempts

1. Re-read the test - is the expectation correct?
2. Check if test has a bug (it happens)
3. Check design decisions - is implementation matching spec?
4. Record blocker:
   ```bash
   ./.aide/bin/aide memory add --category=blocker --tags=project:<name>,session:<id>,source:discovered "Cannot pass test X: <reason>"
   ```
5. **If you abandon the approach**, record it so future sessions don't repeat it:
   ```bash
   ./.aide/bin/aide memory add --category=abandoned \
     --tags=reason:<why>,approach:<what>,project:<name>,session:<id>,source:discovered \
     "ABANDONED: <what was tried>. REASON: <why>. ALTERNATIVE: <new direction>. CONTEXT: <details>"
   ```
6. If stuck after 3 attempts, ask for help

### Build Fails

1. Read error message carefully
2. Check for missing imports
3. Check for type mismatches
4. Fix and re-run build
5. Then re-run tests

### Test Passes But Implementation Feels Wrong

1. If tests pass, the contract is met
2. Don't refactor during implement stage
3. Note concerns for future:
   ```bash
   ./.aide/bin/aide memory add --category=issue --tags=project:<name>,session:<id>,source:discovered "Implementation of X could be improved: <how>"
   ```
4. Proceed - refactoring is a separate concern

**Binary location:** The aide binary is at `.aide/bin/aide`. If it's on your `$PATH`, you can use `aide` directly.

## Verification Checklist

Before completing:

- [ ] All tests pass (not just some)
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Changes are committed
- [ ] No debug code left (console.log, fmt.Println for debugging)

## Completion

When all tests pass:

```bash
# Final verification
npm test -- path/to/feature.test.ts && npm run build

# Or Go
go test -v ./pkg/feature/... && go build ./...
```

Output: "Implementation complete. All tests passing. Ready for VERIFY stage."

## Memory Hygiene

When storing memories from this skill (blockers, issues, abandoned approaches), always:

1. **Include `source:` tag** — Use `source:discovered` for things you found, `source:inferred` for deductions
2. **Include scope tags** — Add `project:<name>,session:<id>` (get project name from git remote or directory; session ID from `$AIDE_SESSION_ID` or `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`)
3. **Verify codebase claims** before storing — If a memory references a file, function, or path, confirm it exists first. See the `memorise` skill for the full verification workflow.
4. **Never use `scope:global`** unless storing a user preference

## Integration with SDLC Pipeline

This skill is designed for the DEV stage:

```
[DESIGN] → [TEST] → [DEV/IMPLEMENT] → [VERIFY] → [DOCS]
                         ↑
                    YOU ARE HERE
```

- **Input**: Failing tests from TEST stage
- **Output**: Passing tests, working implementation
- **Next**: VERIFY stage runs full validation
