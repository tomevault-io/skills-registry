# Context7 Documentation Retrieval

This skill fetches fresh documentation snippets from Context7. Use it instead of relying on possibly outdated training data.

## When to use
- The user asks for docs, API signatures, configuration options, or examples for a library/framework.
- You need to verify correct usage or behavior in a recent version.
- The question is specific to a feature, function, or component.

## Inputs to gather
- **Library name** (required): e.g., react, nextjs, fastapi, axios
- **Topic** (required): e.g., "useState", "app router", "dependency injection"
- **Version** (optional): e.g., "v5", "React 19", "Next 14" (append to query)
- **Output preference** (optional): examples, migration notes, configuration, etc.

If the user does not provide a topic, ask for the exact feature, API, or task.

## Workflow

### 1) Find the library ID
Search for the best matching library. Use a narrow topic to improve ranking.

```bash
curl -sS "https://context7.com/api/v2/libs/search?libraryName=react&query=hooks" | jq '.results[0]'
```

If `jq` is unavailable, use Python:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json,sys
import urllib.request
url = "https://context7.com/api/v2/libs/search?libraryName=react&query=hooks"
data = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen(url))
print(json.dumps(data.get("results", [None])[0], indent=2))
PY
```

**Disambiguation tips**
- Prefer results with titles that match the official docs.
- Use `description` and `totalSnippets` to confirm relevance.
- If unclear, inspect `.results[0..3]` and pick the closest match.
- If still ambiguous, present top options and ask the user to choose.

### 2) Fetch documentation
Use the chosen `libraryId` and a focused query. Default to `type=txt` for readability.

```bash
curl -sS "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=/websites/react_dev_reference&query=useState&type=txt"
```

If the user mentions a version, add it to the query:

```bash
curl -sS "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=/vercel/next.js&query=app+router+next+14&type=txt"
```

If you need structured output, use `type=json` and extract snippets.

### 3) Answer with evidence
Provide a concise summary and quote the relevant lines from the snippet. Do not invent APIs.

Recommended output structure:
- 2-5 bullet summary of what the docs say
- short quoted snippet(s) as evidence
- minimal code example if the user asked for one
- note any uncertainty or missing details

### 4) If results are empty or off-topic
- Broaden or rephrase the query (e.g., add the component name).
- Try alternate library names (reactjs vs react, next vs nextjs).
- Check additional search results and pick a better libraryId.
- Ask a focused follow-up question only if necessary.

## Examples

**React hooks documentation**

```bash
curl -sS "https://context7.com/api/v2/libs/search?libraryName=react&query=hooks" | jq '.results[0].id'
curl -sS "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=/websites/react_dev_reference&query=useState&type=txt"
```

**Next.js app router**

```bash
curl -sS "https://context7.com/api/v2/libs/search?libraryName=nextjs&query=app%20router" | jq '.results[0].id'
curl -sS "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=/vercel/next.js&query=app%20router&type=txt"
```

**FastAPI dependency injection**

```bash
curl -sS "https://context7.com/api/v2/libs/search?libraryName=fastapi&query=dependency%20injection" | jq '.results[0].id'
curl -sS "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=/fastapi/fastapi&query=dependency%20injection&type=txt"
```

## Optional CLI helpers

If you want a single command to search/fetch, use the bundled scripts:

```bash
./scripts/context7.py search react hooks
./scripts/context7.py fetch /websites/react_dev_reference useState
```

```bash
./scripts/context7.sh search react hooks
CONTEXT7_TYPE=txt ./scripts/context7.sh fetch /websites/react_dev_reference useState
```

- Optional helper scripts: `scripts/context7.sh`, `scripts/context7.py`
