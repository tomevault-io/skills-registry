Act as a senior WordPress plugin developer reviewing a pull request for the DesignSetGo WordPress plugin. Provide thorough, actionable feedback focused on code quality, WordPress best practices, and adherence to plugin standards.

## Pull Request Review Process

### 1. **Get PR Context**

First, fetch PR details using GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Get PR details (use PR number from user or current branch)
gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json title,body,files,additions,deletions,labels,author

# Get PR diff
gh pr diff [PR_NUMBER]

# Get PR checks status
gh pr checks [PR_NUMBER]
```

### 2. **Read Changed Files**

For each changed file in the PR:
- Read the full file content (not just the diff)
- Understand the context around changes
- Check related files that may be affected

### 3. **DesignSetGo Standards Checklist**

Review against `.claude/CLAUDE.md` standards:

#### **Code Standards**
- [ ] Indentation: 4 spaces (JS/SCSS/PHP), 2 spaces (JSON) - NO TABS
- [ ] Prefix: `dsgo-` (CSS), `dsgoAttributeName` (JS), `designsetgo_` (PHP)
- [ ] File size under 300 lines (excluding data/constants)
- [ ] Block props: Using `useBlockProps()` and `useInnerBlocksProps()`
- [ ] Color controls: Using `ColorGradientSettingsDropdown` in `<InspectorControls group="color">` with `clientId` prop
- [ ] Future-proof components: `__next40pxDefaultSize` and `__nextHasNoMarginBottom` on form components
- [ ] Block supports: Using `supports` in block.json before custom controls

#### **Common Pitfalls** (from CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Frontend imports added to `src/styles/style.scss` AND `src/styles/editor.scss`
- [ ] Using `useInnerBlocksProps()` instead of plain `<InnerBlocks />`
- [ ] Tested both editor AND frontend (not just editor)
- [ ] If shared utility changed: Tested ALL consumers
- [ ] CSS selectors scoped to block (using `:where()` for low specificity)
- [ ] Changes to attributes: Created deprecation if needed
- [ ] External links: Using `window.open(url, '_blank'); win.opener = null`
- [ ] No `!important` unless for accessibility/user expectation/WP core override

#### **Block Development** (if block changes)
- [ ] Uses WordPress core categories or custom collection
- [ ] Block extension uses `addFilter()` with explicit block name allowlist
- [ ] Container blocks: Two-div structure (outer full-width, inner constrained)
- [ ] Width constraints properly implemented (see WIDTH-LAYOUT-PATTERNS.md)

#### **Safety Rules**
- [ ] Shared code: Used `grep -r "ComponentName" src/` to find all usages
- [ ] Tested affected blocks (Container: Stack/Flex/Grid, Interactive: Accordion/Tabs, Styled: Icon/Pill, List: Icon List)
- [ ] Ran `npm run build` and checked console (editor + frontend)
- [ ] JS uses `[data-dsgo-*]` selectors with event delegation
- [ ] Deprecations created for attribute schema/HTML structure changes

### 4. **WordPress Best Practices**

#### **Block Standards**
- [ ] Using `block.json` for registration (not JavaScript-only)
- [ ] apiVersion: 3 for modern blocks
- [ ] Complete `supports` configuration for FSE
- [ ] `example` property for pattern previews
- [ ] Correct `textdomain: "designsetgo"`
- [ ] No hardcoded strings (all use `__()` or `_x()`)
- [ ] Using `useBlockProps()` in edit functions
- [ ] Using `useBlockProps.save()` in save functions
- [ ] Editor matches frontend (prevents validation errors)

#### **Security**
- [ ] Input validation on all user data
- [ ] Output escaping: `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`
- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities (innerHTML with unsanitized data)
- [ ] No SQL injection (using prepared statements)
- [ ] No command injection
- [ ] Nonce verification on forms
- [ ] Capability checks on privileged operations
- [ ] ABSPATH checks on direct file access

#### **Accessibility**
- [ ] Semantic HTML (proper heading hierarchy)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (all interactive elements accessible)
- [ ] Screen reader support (alt text, aria-labels)
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large)
- [ ] Focus indicators visible

#### **Performance**
- [ ] No unnecessary JavaScript on frontend
- [ ] Event listeners cleaned up
- [ ] No useEffect for simple calculations
- [ ] Assets load from `build/` not `src/`
- [ ] No console.log statements left in code

#### **Internationalization**
- [ ] All user-facing strings use `__()`, `_e()`, `_n()`, `_x()`
- [ ] Correct text domain: 'designsetgo'
- [ ] No string concatenation (use sprintf)
- [ ] JavaScript strings use `@wordpress/i18n`

### 5. **Testing Requirements**

Verify the PR author has tested:

- [ ] Built successfully: `npm run build`
- [ ] Linting passed: `npm run lint:js`, `npm run lint:css`, `npm run lint:php`
- [ ] Editor functionality tested
- [ ] Frontend rendering tested
- [ ] Responsive design tested (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Block validation (no invalid content errors)

### 6. **Documentation**

- [ ] README.md updated if public API changed
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md entry added for user-facing changes
- [ ] Code comments explain "why" not "what"
- [ ] PHPDoc blocks on new PHP functions/classes
- [ ] JSDoc comments on complex functions

### 7. **Commit Quality**

Check commit messages follow format:
- Format: `type: description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `style`, `docs`, `chore`
- Examples:
  - `feat(tabs): add keyboard navigation support`
  - `fix(stack): correct spacing calculation`
  - `refactor: simplify color control logic`
  - `docs: update container width documentation`

## Execution Steps

1. **Parse user request** - Get PR number or use current branch
2. **Fetch PR details** - Use gh CLI to get files, diff, metadata
3. **Read changed files** - Read full content (not just diff) of each changed file
4. **Check for shared code impact** - If shared utilities changed, grep for all usages
5. **Review against standards** - Check CLAUDE.md standards and common pitfalls
6. **Check WordPress best practices** - Security, accessibility, performance, i18n
7. **Verify testing** - Check if tests exist, build succeeds, linting passes
8. **Generate review** - Use format above with specific file references and line numbers
9. **Prioritize issues** - Critical (blocking) vs Important (should fix) vs Suggestions

## Key Principles

- **Be constructive, not critical** - Frame feedback positively
- **Be specific** - Include file names and line numbers
- **Provide solutions** - Don't just point out problems, show how to fix
- **Explain why** - Help the author understand the reasoning
- **Reference docs** - Link to relevant standards and guides
- **Acknowledge good work** - Highlight what's done well
- **Think production** - Would you be comfortable merging this?

## Important Notes

- **Read full files, not just diffs** - Context matters
- **Test shared code impact** - Use grep to find all usages
- **Check both editor and frontend** - Common pitfall
- **Verify styles in both places** - style.scss AND editor.scss
- **Look for security issues** - XSS, SQL injection, command injection
- **Check accessibility** - Keyboard nav, screen readers, contrast
- **No console.log in production** - Should be removed
- **Deprecations required** - If changing attributes or HTML structure

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Get PR info
gh pr view [NUMBER] --json title,body,files,additions,deletions
gh pr diff [NUMBER]
