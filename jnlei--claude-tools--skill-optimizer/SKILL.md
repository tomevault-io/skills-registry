# Skill Optimizer

## Purpose

Optimize existing Claude Code skills to minimize token consumption by leveraging the three-level content loading architecture and progressive disclosure patterns.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Analyzing existing skills for optimization opportunities
- Skills are too large (approaching or exceeding 500 lines)
- Need to reduce context consumption
- Restructuring skills for progressive disclosure
- Converting monolithic skills to multi-file architecture
- Optimizing YAML frontmatter for better discovery
- Improving skill performance and load times
- Auditing skills for token efficiency
- Creating new skills with optimization in mind

---

## Content Loading Architecture

### Three-Level Loading System

**Level 1: Metadata (Always Loaded - ~100 tokens/skill)**
- YAML frontmatter in SKILL.md
- Loaded at startup into system prompt
- Enables skill discovery without context overhead
- **Optimization Target**: Description field (max 1024 chars)

**Level 2: Instructions (Loaded When Triggered - <5,000 tokens)**
- Main SKILL.md content
- Loads dynamically when skill is relevant
- Contains workflows, best practices, guidance
- **Optimization Target**: Keep under 500 lines

**Level 3: Resources (Loaded As Needed - Variable)**
- Additional markdown files (REFERENCE.md, EXAMPLES.md, etc.)
- Code scripts in scripts/ directory
- Templates, schemas, documentation
- **Optimization Target**: No penalty until accessed

### Key Principle

**"Files don't consume context until accessed"** - Bundle comprehensive documentation in reference files without context penalty.

---

## Quick Optimization Workflow

### 1. Analyze Current State

**Check skill size:**
```bash
wc -l .claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
```

**Identify optimization opportunities:**
- [ ] SKILL.md > 500 lines?
- [ ] Detailed API docs in main file?
- [ ] Extensive examples in main file?
- [ ] Long reference tables or schemas?
- [ ] Code snippets that could be scripts?
- [ ] Multiple distinct topics/sections?

### 2. Apply 500-Line Rule

**If SKILL.md > 500 lines:**

✅ **Keep in main file:**
- Purpose and when to use
- Quick start / common workflows
- Critical best practices
- Brief examples (5-10 lines)
- Cross-references to detailed files

❌ **Move to reference files:**
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Extensive code examples (>20 lines)
- Detailed troubleshooting guides
- Pattern libraries
- Schema definitions
- Long reference tables

### 3. Structure Reference Files

**Create organized reference hierarchy:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # <500 lines, workflows & quick ref
├── REFERENCE.md          # Comprehensive documentation
├── EXAMPLES.md           # Detailed code examples
├── PATTERNS.md           # Pattern library
├── TROUBLESHOOTING.md    # Debug guide
└── scripts/              # Executable utilities
    └── helper.sh
```

**Add table of contents to files >100 lines**

### 4. Optimize YAML Frontmatter

**Description optimization (max 1024 chars):**

✅ **Include:**
- All trigger keywords and phrases
- Use cases and scenarios
- File types and technologies
- Common action verbs
- Related concepts

❌ **Avoid:**
- Generic descriptions
- Missing key terms
- Overly verbose explanations

**Example:**
```yaml
---
name: database-development
description: Database development guidance for PostgreSQL including schema design, migrations, RLS policies, indexing strategies, privacy-preserving patterns, query optimization, and Prisma ORM. Use when working with tables, columns, indexes, migrations, RLS, Row-Level Security, database schema, SQL queries, Prisma schema, database optimization, privacy architecture, or PostgreSQL best practices.
---
```

### 5. Implement Progressive Disclosure

**Pattern:**
```markdown
## Topic Overview

Brief explanation (2-3 sentences).

**Key Points:**
- Important consideration 1
- Important consideration 2

**For detailed information**: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#topic-details)

**Quick Example:**
\`\`\`typescript
// Minimal working example (5-10 lines)
\`\`\`

**For more examples**: [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md#topic-examples)
```

## Optimization Patterns Summary

### Pattern 1: Extract API Documentation

**Strategy**: Move detailed API docs to REFERENCE.md

**Before**: 80+ lines of API documentation in SKILL.md
**After**: 10-line summary with link to complete docs
**Savings**: ~70 lines (~1,400 tokens)

**For complete pattern details**: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#pattern-1-extract-api-documentation)

### Pattern 2: Extract Pattern Libraries

**Strategy**: Move code patterns to PATTERNS.md

**Before**: 200+ lines of pattern code in SKILL.md
**After**: 18-line summary with quick example
**Savings**: ~182 lines (~3,640 tokens)

**For complete pattern details**: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#pattern-2-extract-pattern-libraries)

### Pattern 3: Extract Troubleshooting

**Strategy**: Move debug guides to TROUBLESHOOTING.md

**Before**: 300+ lines of troubleshooting in SKILL.md
**After**: 18-line summary with quick diagnostics
**Savings**: ~282 lines (~5,640 tokens)

**For complete pattern details**: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#pattern-3-extract-troubleshooting)

### Pattern 4: Convert Code to Scripts

**Strategy**: Move executable code to scripts/ directory

**Before**: 55+ lines of bash script in SKILL.md
**After**: 7-line reference to executable script
**Savings**: ~48 lines (~960 tokens) + script code never enters context

**For complete pattern details**: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#pattern-4-convert-code-to-scripts)

## Common Anti-Patterns

Avoid these common mistakes when creating or optimizing skills:

❌ **Anti-Pattern 1: Monolithic Skills**
- Single SKILL.md with 1000+ lines
- Solution: Split into main + reference files

❌ **Anti-Pattern 2: Incomplete References**
- Reference files exist but not linked
- Solution: Link all reference files from SKILL.md

❌ **Anti-Pattern 3: Nested References**
- References pointing to other references (>1 level)
- Solution: Keep hierarchy flat (max 1 level)

❌ **Anti-Pattern 4: Sparse Frontmatter**
- Minimal YAML description missing keywords
- Solution: Rich description with all triggers

❌ **Anti-Pattern 5: Code as Documentation**
- 100+ line scripts embedded in markdown
- Solution: Move to scripts/ directory

**For detailed anti-patterns and solutions**: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#common-anti-patterns)

## Migration Workflow

### Quick Migration Steps

**Phase 1: Discovery**
```bash
# Check skill size
wc -l .claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md

# Identify sections to extract
grep "^##" .claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
```

**Phase 2: Planning**
- Design file hierarchy (SKILL.md + reference files)
- Plan content distribution
- Identify scripts to extract

**Phase 3: Implementation**
```bash
# Create reference files
touch REFERENCE.md EXAMPLES.md
mkdir -p scripts

# Extract content systematically
# 1. Copy section to reference file
# 2. Replace in SKILL.md with summary + link
# 3. Verify link works
# 4. Remove detailed content from SKILL.md
```

**Phase 4: Optimization**
- Trim remaining content
- Optimize frontmatter with trigger keywords
- Add navigation aids (table of contents)

**Phase 5: Validation**
```bash
# Verify under 500 lines
wc -l .claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md

# Test links work
grep -o '\[.*\](.*\.md#.*)' SKILL.md
```

## Advanced Techniques

Quick reference to advanced optimization strategies:

**Technique 1: Conditional Content Loading**
- Structure content so advanced sections load only when needed
- Benefits: Most users don't load advanced content

**Technique 2: Layered Examples**
- Progressive complexity: minimal → production → enterprise
- Benefits: Beginners see simple examples, advanced users access complex ones

**Technique 3: Executable Documentation**
- Scripts that both execute and document
- Benefits: Zero token cost, self-documenting output

**Technique 4: Tabular Compression**
- Use tables to compress structured data
- Benefits: 60%+ space reduction for configurations/options

**Technique 5: Smart Chunking**
- Group related small sections instead of individual extraction
- Benefits: Better narrative flow, fewer cross-references

**For detailed advanced techniques**: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#advanced-optimization-techniques)

tokens=$((lines * 20))  # Conservative: 20 tokens/line
echo "Estimated tokens: ~$tokens"
```

**Target**: Keep SKILL.md under 10,000 tokens (~500 lines)

### Before/After Comparison

```bash
# Calculate savings
BEFORE=850  # lines before optimization
AFTER=420   # lines after optimization
SAVINGS=$((BEFORE - AFTER))
TOKEN_SAVINGS=$((SAVINGS * 20))

echo "Reduced by $SAVINGS lines"
echo "Estimated token savings: ~$TOKEN_SAVINGS tokens"
```

### Quality Checks

- [ ] All original information preserved
- [ ] Links work correctly
- [ ] Main file comprehensive for common cases
- [ ] Reference files well-organized
- [ ] Navigation intuitive

**For detailed measurement methods**: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#measurement--validation)

## Best Practices Summary

✅ **DO:**
- Keep SKILL.md minimum but use other reference files to keep the full and detailed knowledge base
- Use progressive disclosure (overview → details)
- Include all trigger keywords in description
- Create clear cross-references to detailed docs
- Add table of contents to reference files >100 lines
- Convert reusable code to scripts
- Test optimization with real usage

❌ **DON'T:**
- Exceed 500 lines in SKILL.md
- Nest references more than 1 level deep
- Include API docs in main file
- Embed long code examples in main file
- Create reference files without linking them
- Use sparse YAML descriptions
- Optimize without preserving critical info

---

## Quick Reference

**File size limits:**
- SKILL.md: <500 lines (strict)
- Reference files: No limit (loaded on-demand)
- YAML description: 1024 chars max

**Optimization priority:**
1. Apply 500-line rule to SKILL.md
2. Extract API docs to REFERENCE.md
3. Move examples to EXAMPLES.md or PATTERNS.md
4. Convert scripts to scripts/ directory
5. Enrich YAML frontmatter description

**Common extractions:**
- API documentation → REFERENCE.md
- Code examples → EXAMPLES.md
- Troubleshooting → TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- Pattern library → PATTERNS.md
- Scripts → scripts/ directory

**Typical token savings:**
- API extraction: ~1,400 tokens
- Pattern library: ~3,640 tokens
- Troubleshooting: ~5,640 tokens
- Scripts: ~960 tokens + no code in context

**For comprehensive optimization patterns and detailed workflows**: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

## Real-World Example

**Before optimization:**
```
skill-example/
└── SKILL.md  (850 lines, ~17,000 tokens)
```

**After optimization:**
```
skill-example/
├── SKILL.md              (420 lines, ~8,400 tokens)
├── REFERENCE.md          (350 lines, loaded on-demand)
├── EXAMPLES.md           (180 lines, loaded on-demand)
└── scripts/
    ├── validate.sh       (code never enters context)
    └── setup.sh          (code never enters context)
```

**Result**: 50% token reduction on initial load, comprehensive docs still available on-demand

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Audit existing skills: `wc -l .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
2. Identify candidates for optimization (>500 lines)
3. Apply optimization workflow
4. Measure token savings
5. Validate with real usage

**For detailed guidance**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for complete optimization patterns, anti-patterns, migration workflows, and advanced techniques.
