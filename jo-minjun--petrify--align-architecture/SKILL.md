# Align Architecture

Audit the codebase against AGENTS.md and fix all discrepancies.

## Process

### 1. Load Rules

Read AGENTS.md (or CLAUDE.md) to extract the full rule set. Parse and categorize every rule into:
- Architecture constraints
- DO rules
- DON'T rules

### 2. Audit

For each extracted rule, use the Explore agent to verify compliance across the codebase. Report each rule as PASS or FAIL with specific file paths and line numbers.

### 3. Plan Fixes

For each FAIL, create actionable fix items using TodoWrite.

### 4. Implement

- Remove violating tests entirely (no commenting out)
- Fix import patterns, configuration, or dependency violations
- Sync documentation with actual state
- Never introduce new violations while fixing

### 5. Verify

Run `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` (if available). All tests must pass.

### 6. Summary

Report: total rules checked, pass/fail counts, fixes applied, test results.
