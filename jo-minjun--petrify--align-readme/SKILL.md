# Align README

Scan the codebase and interactively synchronize README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with code reality.

**Code is the source of truth.** AGENTS.md is read-only reference (use `align-architecture` to audit code against AGENTS.md — this skill does the reverse).

## Process

### 1. Scan Codebase

Collect current state from code:

**Packages** — Read `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to get package globs, then find all matching `package.json` files. Extract each `name` field. Build the directory tree.

**Ports & Adapters** — Read `packages/core/src/ports/*.ts` for port interface names. Search adapter `src/` dirs for `implements <PortName>` to build the mapping. Note supported file extensions per adapter.

**Plugin Settings** — Read `packages/obsidian-plugin/src/settings-tab.ts`. Extract setting names and descriptions from the UI registration code.

**Plugin Features** — Read `packages/obsidian-plugin/src/main.ts` and related files. Identify registered commands, event handlers, and capabilities.

### 2. Parse Documents

Read README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md. Split into auditable sections:

**README.md:**
- Supported list (Parser, OCR, Output, Watcher)
- Planned items
- Features list
- Settings table
- Requirements

**CONTRIBUTING.md:**
- Package structure tree
- Port-Adapter mapping table
- Data flow diagram
- New adapter checklist

### 3. Compare & Update (Section by Section)

Process each section in order (README first, then CONTRIBUTING):

1. Compare code-collected data against document content
2. If **matching** → report `PASS`, move on
3. If **discrepancy found**:
   - Show what the document says vs what the code shows
   - Propose specific edits
   - Ask user: approve / modify / skip
   - Apply on approval

Preserve existing document formatting and style. Change only what is necessary.

### 4. Report

After all sections are processed, print a summary:

```
## align-readme Results

| Document | Section | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| README.md | Supported list | PASS / UPDATED / SKIPPED |
| ... | ... | ... |

Checked: N sections | Passed: N | Updated: N | Skipped: N
```
