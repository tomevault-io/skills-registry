# Frontend Development

Universal frontend workflow guiding componentization, state management, testing, and deployment. Technology-agnostic, orchestrates technical skills (react, typescript, a11y) without duplicating patterns.

## When to Use

- Building, refactoring, or scaling frontend apps
- Managing state, side effects, or data flow
- Preparing for deployment or CI/CD
- Reviewing code quality

Don't use for:

- Technology-specific code (use react, typescript skills)
- Backend development (use backend-dev skill)

## Critical Patterns

### ✅ REQUIRED: Componentization with Single Responsibility

Build small, reusable components that do one thing well.

**Decision Tree**:

- Component doing >1 thing? → Split into focused components
- Logic mixed with presentation? → Extract custom hooks
- Component >100 lines? → Decompose into smaller units

**Implementation**: Delegate to [react](../react/SKILL.md) for component patterns

**Example Decomposition**:

```
Monolithic UserDashboard (200 lines)
  ↓
UserDashboard (layout coordinator, 20 lines)
  → UserList (renders list, 15 lines)
    → UserCard (single user, 25 lines)
      → Avatar (image display, 10 lines)
      → Button (action trigger, 8 lines)
  → LoadingSpinner (loading state, 5 lines)
```

**When to Stop Decomposing**:

- Component <30 lines AND single responsibility
- No reusable parts remain
- Further splitting hurts readability

### ✅ REQUIRED: State Management with Colocated State

Keep state as local as possible. Lift to global only when necessary.

**Decision Tree**:

```
Need state?
  → Used by 1 component? → Local state (useState)
  → Used by 2-3 sibling components? → Lift to parent
  → Used across component tree? → Context API
  → Shared across entire app + complex updates? → Redux/Zustand

Data from server?
  → Use React Query/SWR (NOT Redux for server state)

Derived state?
  → Compute during render (NOT useState)
  → Expensive computation? → useMemo
```

**Implementation**: Delegate to [react](../react/SKILL.md) for state patterns

### ✅ REQUIRED: Testing with User-Centric Approach

Test behavior, not implementation. Simulate real user interactions.

**Decision Tree**:

```
What to test?
  → User flows (registration, checkout)? → Integration tests (react-testing-library)
  → Edge cases + error states? → Unit tests (jest)
  → Full app workflows? → E2E tests (playwright)

How to query elements?
  → Prefer: getByRole, getByLabelText (accessible queries)
  → Avoid: getByTestId (implementation detail)
```

**Implementation**: Delegate to [react-testing-library](../react-testing-library/SKILL.md) and [unit-testing](../unit-testing/SKILL.md)

**Testing Priorities**:

1. Critical user flows (login, checkout, payment)
2. Error states (network failure, validation errors)
3. Edge cases (empty state, loading, no permissions)
4. Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader)

### ✅ REQUIRED: Environment-Based Configuration

Use environment variables for configuration. Never hardcode.

**Decision Tree**:

```
Need configuration?
  → API URL? → VITE_API_URL / NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
  → Feature flags? → VITE_ENABLE_FEATURE=true/false
  → Environment detection? → import.meta.env.MODE / process.env.NODE_ENV

Sensitive data (API keys)?
  → NEVER in frontend code
  → Use backend proxy for API calls
```

**Implementation**: Delegate to framework-specific skills ([next](../next/SKILL.md), [vite](../vite/SKILL.md))

**Configuration Pattern**:

```
config.ts
  → apiUrl (from env var, fallback to localhost)
  → environment (development | production)
  → features (object with boolean flags)

.env.example
  → Documents all required env vars
  → Committed to repo

.env.local
  → Actual values (NOT committed)
```

### ✅ REQUIRED: Component Hierarchy

**When designing component tree**:

1. **Identify data flow**: Where does data originate? Where is it consumed?
2. **Find common ancestor**: Lowest component that can own state
3. **Minimize prop drilling**: If passing props >2 levels, consider context
4. **Separate concerns**: Layout components (div, flex) vs logic components (data fetching, state)

**Red Flags**:

- Props passed through 3+ levels without being used
- Parent component knowing too much about child internals
- Component receiving >8 props (too many responsibilities)

### ✅ REQUIRED: Data Fetching Strategy

**Decision Tree**:

```
Fetching data?
  → Static content (marketing page)? → SSG (Static Site Generation)
  → Dynamic content + SEO critical? → SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
  → Dynamic content + NOT SEO critical? → CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

Which library?
  → REST API? → React Query / SWR
  → GraphQL? → Apollo Client / urql
  → Real-time updates? → WebSockets + React Query
```

**Implementation**: Delegate to framework skills ([next](../next/SKILL.md), [react](../react/SKILL.md))

### ✅ REQUIRED: Performance Optimization

**When to optimize**:

1. Measure FIRST (React DevTools Profiler, Lighthouse)
2. Identify bottlenecks (slow renders, large bundles)
3. Apply targeted fixes (NOT premature optimization)

**Common Optimizations**:

- Lazy load routes → React.lazy + Suspense
- Lazy load images → Intersection Observer
- Memoize expensive calculations → useMemo
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders → React.memo, useCallback
- Code splitting → Dynamic imports

**Red Flags (Premature Optimization)**:

- Using React.memo everywhere "just in case"
- useCallback for simple functions
- Optimizing before measuring

---

## Decision Tree

```
New feature?
  → Create isolated, testable component

State needed?
  → Local state first; global store only when shared across components

Deployment?
  → Automate with CI/CD (lint → test → build → deploy)

Bug found?
  → Add/expand test coverage before fixing
```

---

## Example

Building a product list page: component decomposition, state, data fetching, and testing.

```typescript
// 1. Component decomposition — each piece has one responsibility
// ProductListPage.tsx (layout coordinator, ~25 lines)
function ProductListPage() {
  const { data: products, isLoading, error } = useProducts(); // React Query: server state
  const [search, setSearch] = useState("");                   // local state: UI only

  if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (error)     return <ErrorBanner message={error.message} />;

  const filtered = products.filter(p => p.name.includes(search)); // derived — no useState
  return (
    <>
      <SearchInput value={search} onChange={setSearch} />
      <ProductGrid products={filtered} />
    </>
  );
}

// ProductGrid.tsx — renders list, no data fetching concern
// ProductCard.tsx — single product display, receives data via props

// 2. Data fetching — React Query manages caching + loading/error states
function useProducts() {
  return useQuery({ queryKey: ["products"], queryFn: () => api.get("/products") });
}

// 3. Test — user-centric, tests behavior not implementation
it("filters products by search input", async () => {
  render(<ProductListPage />);
  await screen.findByRole("list");                          // wait for data
  await userEvent.type(screen.getByRole("searchbox"), "shoe");
  expect(screen.getByText("Running Shoe")).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.queryByText("Blue T-Shirt")).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Patterns applied: component decomposition by responsibility, local state for UI, React Query for server state, derived state computed during render, `getByRole` accessible queries.

## Edge Cases

- **State sync bugs**: Race conditions occur when async operations complete out of order. Use cleanup functions in useEffect. Consider using state management libraries (Redux, Zustand) for complex async flows.

- **Build pipeline failures**: Environment variables not set cause production builds to fail. Validate required env vars at build time. Use .env.example to document required variables.

- **Cross-browser or device-specific issues**: Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). Use feature detection instead of browser detection. Polyfill missing APIs.

- **Memory leaks**: Event listeners, subscriptions, and timers not cleaned up cause memory leaks. Always return cleanup function from useEffect. Unsubscribe from observables.

- **Bundle size bloat**: Importing entire libraries increases bundle size. Use tree-shaking compatible libraries. Import only what you need (import { Button } from 'library' not import * as Library).

## Workflow

**E2E Development Workflow**:

1. **brainstorming** → Evaluate alternatives, high-level planning
2. **writing-plans** → Break into executable tasks (2-5 min, file paths)
3. **frontend-dev** (this skill) → Apply Frontend Developer thinking and architecture
4. **plan-execution** → Execute in batches of 3 with checkpoints
5. **verification-protocol** → Verify each task (IDENTIFY → RUN → READ → VERIFY → CLAIM)
6. **code-review** → Two-stage review (spec compliance → code quality)
