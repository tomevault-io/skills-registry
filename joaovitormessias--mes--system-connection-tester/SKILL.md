# System Connection Tester Skill

This skill provides a Python-based utility to verify that all critical components of the MES and Digital Twin infrastructure are reachable and responding correctly. It checks connections to databases, message brokers, and API endpoints.

## When to use this skill

Invoke this skill when:
1.  **Troubleshooting**: Investigating why parts of the system are not communicating.
2.  **Post-Deployment Verification**: Confirming that a new deployment (local or remote) is fully operational.
3.  **Health Checks**: Periodically checking the status of the integrated environment.

## Skill contents

| Resource | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| scripts/check_connections.py | Python script that attempts to connect to Postgres, Redis, MQTT, and HTTP endpoints |
| scripts/requirements.txt | Dependencies for the testing script |

## Usage

### 1. Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration
The script looks for environment variables to know where to connect. It can load from a `.env` file if present, or use defaults suitable for the docker-compose environment.
Crucially, if running from *outside* docker (e.g. your local terminal), ensure mapped ports match.

Defaults used if vars not set:
- **MES Backend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Postgres**: localhost:5433 (MES), localhost:5432 (DT)
- **Redis**: localhost:6379
- **MQTT**: localhost:1884 (Mosquitto), localhost:1885 (ThingsBoard)

### 3. Running the check
Execute the script:
```bash
python scripts/check_connections.py
```
Or with specific env vars:
```bash
MES_BASE_URL=http://myapp.local python scripts/check_connections.py
```

## Output
The script prints a report of PASS/FAIL status for each component:
```
[PASS] MES Postgres Connection (localhost:5433)
[PASS] MES Redis Connection (localhost:6379)
[FAIL] MQTT Broker (localhost:1884) - Connection Refused
...
```
