# Session Ready for PR & Merge Skill

Comprehensive workflow for preparing a development branch for pull request submission and eventual merge into main. Ensures quality gates, proper documentation, and smooth integration.

## Auto-Trigger Keywords

The skill activates when messages contain PR/merge readiness keywords:
- **PR Readiness**: "ready for PR", "create PR", "submit PR", "open PR"
- **Merge Readiness**: "ready to merge", "ready for merge", "prepare for merge"
- **Completion**: "finished feature", "work complete", "done with changes"
- **Final Check**: "final check", "before submitting", "before merge"

---

## PR Preparation Workflow (7 Phases)

### Phase 1: Pre-PR Validation Checklist ✓

**Objective**: Verify all prerequisites met before starting PR process

1. **Code Hygiene Check**
   ```bash
   # Look for debug code, console logs, temporary files
   grep -r "Logger.log" *.gs | grep -v "test\|Test\|AuditLogger"
   grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX" *.gs
   grep -r "debugger\|console.log" *.gs
   ls -la *.backup *.tmp 2>/dev/null
   ```
   - Remove debug logs (unless intentional error tracking)
   - Address TODOs or document as future work
   - Remove temporary files and backups
   - Clean up commented-out code (unless historically useful)

2. **Git State Verification**
   ```bash
   git status
   git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD  # Shows commits ahead
   ```
   - No uncommitted changes (all work staged and committed)
   - Branch ahead of main (has commits to merge)
   - No merge conflicts
   - Working directory clean

3. **Commit Structure Review**
   - Each commit is logical and self-contained?
   - No WIP (Work In Progress) commits?
   - No duplicate fixes or reversions?
   - Commit messages follow Angular style?

4. **Test Status**
   - All unit tests pass?
   - All integration tests pass?
   - No failing test cases?
   - Test coverage adequate for changes?

5. **Documentation**
   - CLAUDE.md updated if architecture changed?
   - README.md updated if features added?
   - Code comments added for complex logic?
   - Module responsibilities clear?

**Checklist**:
- [ ] No debug logs or temporary code
- [ ] No uncommitted changes
- [ ] Branch has commits ahead of main
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventions
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No merge conflicts

---

### Phase 2: Branch Cleanup & Optimization ✓

**Objective**: Ensure clean, properly structured commit history

1. **Identify Issues**
   - Any WIP commits? (work in progress)
   - Any revert commits? (indicate rework)
   - Any empty commits?
   - Any commits with duplicate changes?

2. **Rebase/Squash Recommendations**
   - Multiple commits fixing same issue? → Consider squashing
   - Small cleanup after main commit? → Squash into original
   - Multiple phases of same feature? → Keep separate with clear messages
   - Bug fix after commit? → Squash into original fix

3. **Interactive Rebase (If Needed)**
   ```bash
   # Only if commits need consolidation
   git rebase -i origin/main
   # Then: squash, reorder, edit as needed
   ```

4. **Verify Final Commit List**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
   ```
   - Each commit is meaningful
   - Commits are in logical order
   - No WIP or temporary commits
   - Messages are clear and descriptive

**Decision Tree**:
- Do you have 1-2 commits? → Keep as is, good for PR
- Do you have 3-5 focused commits? → Keep separate, each tells story
- Do you have 10+ commits with fixes? → Consider squashing related ones
- Do you have WIP or revert commits? → These must be cleaned up

---

### Phase 3: Full Test Suite Execution ✓

**Objective**: Verify all code changes work correctly

1. **Run Comprehensive Tests**
   ```bash
   # From Script Editor, run all test suites
   runAllPaymentManagerTests()
   runAllCacheManagerTests()
   runAllInvoiceManagerTests()
   testInvoiceManager()
   runIntegrationTests()
   testMasterDatabaseConnection()  # If Master DB involved
   ```

2. **Test Results Analysis**
   - All tests passing? (0 failures)
   - No performance regressions? (compare with baseline)
   - Test coverage adequate for new code?
   - Edge cases tested?

3. **Document Test Results**
   ```
   TEST RESULTS SUMMARY
   ════════════════════════════════════════
   ✅ PaymentManager Tests: 45 passed, 0 failed
   ✅ CacheManager Tests: 38 passed, 0 failed
   ✅ InvoiceManager Tests: 52 passed, 0 failed
   ✅ Integration Tests: 28 passed, 0 failed
   ✅ Master Database Tests: 12 passed, 0 failed

   Total: 175 passed, 0 failed (100% pass rate)
   ```

4. **Performance Validation** (If performance changes)
   - Run benchmark suite
   - Compare metrics with baseline
   - Document improvement (if any)
   - Check for regressions

---

### Phase 4: Commit Message Validation ✓

**Objective**: Ensure all commits follow Angular conventions

1. **Review Each Commit**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
   # For each commit, verify:
   # - Type: feat, fix, refactor, perf, docs, test, chore
   # - Scope: (optional but recommended)
   # - Subject: max 50 chars, imperative mood, clear
   ```

2. **Use Commit Helper Skill**
   - Review each commit message
   - Ensure format consistency
   - Verify type/scope match actual changes
   - Check subject clarity

3. **Common Commit Issues**
   - ❌ "Updated some stuff" → ✅ "refactor(cache-manager): improve clarity"
   - ❌ "Fixed bug" → ✅ "fix(payment-manager): correct cache invalidation timing"
   - ❌ "stuff" → ✅ "feat(api): add invoice lookup endpoint"

4. **Validation Checklist**
   - [ ] All commits follow Angular style
   - [ ] Types are correct (feat, fix, refactor, etc.)
   - [ ] Scopes are consistent
   - [ ] Subjects are under 50 characters
   - [ ] Subjects use imperative mood
   - [ ] No vague commit messages

---

### Phase 5: Code Quality & Risk Assessment ✓

**Objective**: Identify code quality issues and potential risks

1. **Use Code-Reviewer Agent**
   - Run code review on changed files
   - Check for security vulnerabilities
   - Identify code duplication
   - Verify error handling
   - Check test coverage

2. **Identify Affected Modules**
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD
   # Maps files to modules:
   # PaymentManager.gs → Payment processing
   # CacheManager.gs → Caching system
   # Code.gs → Event handlers
   # etc.
   ```

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Critical modules changed? (Cache, Payment, Lock)
   - Breaking changes introduced?
   - Data migration needed?
   - Backwards compatibility maintained?
   - Master Database mode affected?

4. **Review Focus Areas**
   - What areas need careful review?
   - What could break with this change?
   - What edge cases might exist?
   - What's the rollback plan if issues?

---

### Phase 6: PR Title & Description Generation ✓

**Objective**: Auto-generate comprehensive PR documentation

1. **Extract PR Information**
   ```bash
   # Analyze commits to determine PR purpose
   git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
   git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD
   ```

2. **Determine PR Type**
   - **Feature**: New functionality added
   - **Bugfix**: Defects corrected
   - **Performance**: Speed/efficiency improvements
   - **Refactoring**: Code improvement without behavior change
   - **Mixed**: Multiple types of changes

3. **Draft PR Title** (Examples)
   ```
   ✅ GOOD:
   - feat: add performance profiling & optimization skill
   - fix: correct cache invalidation timing in payment processing
   - perf: implement 75% lock scope reduction in PaymentManager
   - refactor: consolidate duplicate constants to CONFIG

   ❌ BAD:
   - Updates
   - Stuff
   - Multiple changes
   - Random fixes
   ```

## Commit Review Guidelines

When validating commit messages:

✅ **GOOD Examples**
```
feat(agents): add code-reviewer agent for quality assurance

perf(payment-manager): implement 75% lock scope reduction

fix(cache-manager): correct timing in incremental updates

docs: add Master Database setup instructions

refactor(test-suite): standardize naming and add coverage
```

❌ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT Examples**
```
Update stuff              → Be specific about what changed
Fixed bugs                → Which bugs? What was broken?
Changes to multiple files → Too vague, break into logical commits
WIP                       → Incomplete work shouldn't be committed
Merge main               → Document what merge accomplished
```
