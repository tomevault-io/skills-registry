# Accessibility Issue Writer

Format accessibility violations into standardized issue reports using the accessibility-issues-template-mcp.

## Prerequisites

Requires the **accessibility-issues-template-mcp** server configured in your IDE.

**Repository:** [github.com/joe-watkins/accessibility-issues-template-mcp](https://github.com/joe-watkins/accessibility-issues-template-mcp)

Verify these tools are available:
- `format_axe_violation`
- `list_issue_templates`
- `get_issue_template`
- `validate_issue`

## Workflow

1. **Receive violations** - Accept axe-core violations array or individual violation objects
2. **Format each violation** - Call `format_axe_violation` with violation data and context
3. **Output formatted issues** - Present issues in requested format (markdown, JIRA, etc.)

## Issue Quality Checklist (Make It Actionable)

Every issue should answer, in plain language:

- **Expected result:** What should happen for an accessible experience
- **Actual result:** What currently happens (observable failure)
- **User impact:** Who is impacted and how (keyboard-only, screen reader, low vision, cognitive, etc.)
- **Evidence:** One or more of:
  - Failing DOM snippet + selector
  - Count of instances / pages affected
  - Screenshot (if available) or SR output transcript (if provided)
- **Acceptance criteria (Definition of Done):**
  - Concrete pass/fail statements (e.g., “Control has an accessible name exposed to AT”)
  - Include regression-safe constraints (don’t break visible label, don’t change focus order unexpectedly)
- **How to verify:** Minimal steps for QA to confirm the fix (automated + manual)

## MCP Tools

### format_axe_violation

Convert a single axe-core violation to a formatted issue report.

```
format_axe_violation(
  violation: {
    id: "color-contrast",
    impact: "serious",
    tags: ["wcag2aa", "wcag143"],
    description: "Ensures contrast between foreground and background colors meets WCAG 2 AA thresholds",
    help: "Elements must have sufficient color contrast",
    helpUrl: "https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.8/color-contrast",
    nodes: [{ html: "<p class='low-contrast'>...</p>", target: [".low-contrast"] }]
  },
  context: {
    url: "https://example.com",
    browser: "Chromium",
    operatingSystem: "Windows"
  }
)
```

### list_issue_templates

List all 28+ available issue templates.

```
list_issue_templates()
```

### get_issue_template

Retrieve a specific template by axe rule ID.

```
get_issue_template(templateName: "color-contrast")
```

### validate_issue

Check formatted issue for completeness.

```
validate_issue(issue: { /* formatted issue object */ })
```

## Input Formats

### Full axe-core Results

When receiving complete axe-core output, iterate over the `violations` array:

```javascript
// From axe.run() results
results.violations.forEach(violation => {
  format_axe_violation(violation, context)
})
```

### Single Violation

Format individual violations as received:

```
format_axe_violation(violation: singleViolation, context: contextObject)
```

### Manual Input

For manually reported issues, use `get_issue_template` to get the appropriate template structure:

```
get_issue_template(templateName: "button-name")
```

## Output Format

Each formatted issue includes:

- **Title**: Rule name and brief description
- **Severity**: Mapped from axe impact (critical/serious/moderate/minor)
- **URL/Path**: Where the issue was found
- **Steps to reproduce**: Navigation instructions
- **Element**: Description and location
- **What is the issue**: Specific failure description
- **Why it is important**: User impact explanation
- **Code reference**: Failing HTML snippet
- **How to fix**: Remediation guidance
- **Compliant code example**: Fixed HTML snippet
- **How to test**: Automated and manual verification steps
- **Resources**: Deque University link, WCAG reference

### Environment + AT Matrix (when relevant)

If the failure is AT- or browser-dependent (or likely to be), include:

- **Test environment (if known):** OS, browser, assistive technology + version
- **AT/Browser matrix (template):**

| OS | Browser | Assistive Tech | Result | Notes |
|----|---------|----------------|--------|------|
| Windows | Chrome/Edge | NVDA/JAWS | [Pass/Fail/Untested] | |
| macOS | Safari/Chrome | VoiceOver | [Pass/Fail/Untested] | |
| iOS | Safari | VoiceOver | [Pass/Fail/Untested] | |
| Android | Chrome | TalkBack | [Pass/Fail/Untested] | |

Guidance:
- If you only have axe output and no manual testing, mark rows as **Untested** and do not invent results.
- Still include the matrix when you suspect AT differences (custom widgets, ARIA heavy UI, focus management, dialogs/menus/tabs).

### Severity Mapping

| axe Impact | Issue Severity | Priority |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| critical | Critical | Blocker |
| serious | Severe | High |
| moderate | Average | Medium |
| minor | Low | Low |

## WCAG Mapping Guidance (Keep It Precise)

When including WCAG references:

- Prefer **one primary Success Criterion** that best represents the failure.
- Add **secondary SCs** only when clearly applicable (avoid “SC spam”).
- Common mappings:
  - Missing accessible name for interactive control → **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value** (often primary)
  - Missing programmatic label/relationships → **1.3.1 Info and Relationships**
  - Keyboard inoperable interactions → **2.1.1 Keyboard**
  - Focus not visible due to CSS → **2.4.7 Focus Visible**
  - Duplicate IDs / broken ARIA references / invalid markup impacting parsing → **4.1.1 Parsing**
  - Non-text alternative missing → **1.1.1 Non-text Content**

If axe provides tags like `wcag143`:
- Preserve them, but also translate to the human-readable SC name/number in the final issue.

## Batch Processing

When processing multiple violations:

1. **Group by rule** - Combine similar violations
2. **Order by severity** - Critical first, then serious, moderate, minor
3. **Number sequentially** - Issue #1, Issue #2, etc.
4. **Prefer one root cause per ticket**:
   - If multiple nodes share the same underlying fix, keep them together.
   - If nodes differ materially (different components, different fixes), split into separate issues.
5. **Include instance count + sampling**:
   - Provide total occurrences if known (e.g., “12 instances across 3 pages”)
   - Include 1–3 representative selectors/snippets, not an overwhelming dump

Example output structure:

```markdown
# Accessibility Issues Report

**URL:** https://example.com
**Total Issues:** 12

## Critical (2 issues)

### Issue #1: color-contrast - Insufficient contrast ratio
[formatted issue content]

### Issue #2: button-name - Button missing accessible name
[formatted issue content]

## Serious (5 issues)
...
```

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill is called by `a11y-tester` after running axe-core tests. It can also be invoked directly with violations from any source.

**From a11y-tester:**
```
1. a11y-tester runs axe-core → collects violations
2. a11y-tester delegates to a11y-issue-writer → formats issues
3. Output: Summary + formatted issues
```

**Standalone usage:**
```
User provides violations → a11y-issue-writer formats → Output issues
```
