# Nostr workflows

Use this skill for Nostr identifiers, events, and reference resolution.

## Workflow

- Read `references/ids-and-api.md` for identifier and API contract rules.
- Read `references/references.md` for tag/mention resolution behavior.
- Consult `references/identity-resolution.md` for NIP-05 flows.

## Guardrails

- Accept `nostr:`-prefixed identifiers and multiple bech32 types.
- Enforce relay caps, timeouts, and cache TTLs from config.
- Keep all rendered content safe and link references to `/nostr/<id>`.
