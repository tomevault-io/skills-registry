# UI Development Workflow

## Core Loop

1. Implement changes
2. Start dev server in background: `npm run dev &` (check output for port)
3. Take screenshots: `npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size=1280,720 --full-page http://localhost:PORT/path scratch/name.png`
4. Read screenshots yourself
5. Iterate 2-3 times (Anthropic guidance: first pass is good, 2-3 iterations much better)
6. Commit only after visual verification

## Standard Screenshots for This Project

Light and dark mode for:
- Menu page (`/`)
- Game page (`/game`)
- Post-game page (`/post-game`)
- Tutorial modal (first visit to `/`)

## Dark Mode Testing

This project uses class-based dark mode (`<html class="dark">`), not `prefers-color-scheme`.

The `--color-scheme=dark` flag won't work. To test dark mode, navigate and click the toggle button, or use localStorage injection.

## Project-Specific Context

**Stack**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS (class-based dark mode)

**Colors**: Beige/warm palette (beige-50 through beige-300), amber accents, NOT generic white/gray

**Common issues**:
- Modals missing `dark:` variants
- Focus indicators invisible in dark mode
- Components reverting to white backgrounds

## Detailed Review Criteria

See [references/review-criteria.md](references/review-criteria.md) for accessibility, contrast, typography, and visual consistency checklists.
