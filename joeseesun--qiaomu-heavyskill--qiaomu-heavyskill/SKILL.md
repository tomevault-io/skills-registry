# HeavySkill

Multi-agent reasoning pipeline. K isolated subagents reason independently → Codex hosts deliberation → Claude renders a readable Markdown + HTML report.

Based on arXiv:2605.02396. Key finding: deliberation is generative — the synthesizer produces correct answers absent from every individual trace.

## Two Modes

Choose based on whether the question has a correct answer:

| Mode | When | Subagent type | Example |
|------|------|---------------|---------|
| **Verification** | Has a correct/better answer | Reasoning approaches | Code bug, math, logic, factual analysis |
| **Deliberation** | No single correct answer; multiple valid views | Stakeholder perspectives | Tech stack choice, social topic, product decision, strategy |

## Roles

| Role | Implementation | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Parallel Thinkers | K independent subagents (Agent tool, parallel) | One trace each, isolated context |
| Deliberation Host | Codex via `/codex:rescue` | Critical evaluation → synthesized conclusion |
| Report Author | Claude (main context) | Render Markdown + HTML from Codex output |

## Why Subagents

Sequential traces in the same context window are architecturally wrong — the model's attention sees prior traces even when instructed to ignore them. Each subagent gets a fresh isolated context: true independence, not instructed independence.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify** — identify mode (Verification / Deliberation), question, success criteria, K (3 = standard / 4 = complex / 5 = high stakes).
2. **Launch K subagents in parallel** — Agent tool, K simultaneous calls, each with isolated context and one assigned approach type or perspective lens.
3. **Collect** — gather all outputs, identify convergence cluster, flag outliers, shuffle order (prevents Codex position bias).
4. **Codex deliberation** — format traces into structured prompt, invoke `/codex:rescue`. Codex runs: classify → evaluate per-trace → re-derive if all flawed → synthesize.
5. **Render report** — Claude generates:
   - `heavyskill-report.md` — structured Markdown report
   - `heavyskill-report.html` — single-page readable HTML report
   - `heavyskill-report.pdf` — combined PDF (traces overview + deliberation + final verdict), exported from HTML via Chrome headless
6. **Iterate** (optional) — if Codex confidence is Low/Medium, one more deliberation round. Max 2 total.

See [Framework](references/framework.md) for subagent prompts, approach types, perspective lenses, Codex prompt template, and HTML template.

## Output Contract

- Create folder `~/Downloads/heavyskill-reports/{question-slug}-{date}/` before writing any files.
- Write each subagent trace to `traces/trace-{letter}-{approach}.md` as it arrives.
- Write Codex raw output to `deliberation.md`.
- Write final Markdown report to `{slug}.md`.
- Write final HTML report to `{slug}.html` — Medium-style (off-white bg, near-black text, large readable type, generous whitespace, editorial feel), self-contained, no external dependencies.
- After writing HTML, export `{slug}.pdf` via Chrome headless (see framework.md Step 3 for command). PDF is the primary shareable artifact — it combines the traces overview, deliberation process, and final verdict in one document.
- Present Codex output verbatim in the conversation. No paraphrasing.
- Report name is generated from the question — never a generic filename.
