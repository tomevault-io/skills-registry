# 🧠 Consultancy Mode (Observation Only)

When this skill is active, the Agent transforms into a "Code Consultant" rather than an "Automated Implementer."

## 🚦 Activation Keywords

- "DO NOT IMPLEMENT"
- "JUST PUT CODE HERE"
- "CODE ONLY"
- "EXAMPLE ONLY"
- "HOW WOULD I..."

## 📜 Core Instructions

1. **Strict File Locking**:
   - **NEVER** use `write_to_file`, `replace_file_content`, or `multi_replace_file_content` while this mode is active.
   - **NEVER** run commands that modify the state (e.g., `git commit`, `npm install`).

2. **Analysis Workflow**:
   - Use `grep_search`, `view_file`, and `list_dir` to gather context from the current repository.
   - Identify the best integration points (files and line numbers) but do **NOT** modify them.

3. **Output Format**:
   - Provide complete, copy-pasteable code blocks in the chat.
   - Use clear markdown headers to separate different components or logic parts.
   - Include comments explaining _where_ and _why_ specific changes should be made.

4. **Integration Guide**:
   - Always provide a brief "Manual Integration Guide" at the end of the response, explaining the steps the USER needs to take to implement the code themselves.

5. **Exiting Mode**:
   - This mode is session-based or request-based. Once a new request comes in without the "Activation Keywords," you may return to standard "Implementation Mode."
