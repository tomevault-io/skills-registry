# 🦞 Kytin Protocol: State-Locked Hardware Driver

> **System Notice:** This skill binds the Agent's identity to a physical **Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0)**. 
> All cryptographic operations are performed by the local C++ Sentinel Daemon (`kytin_sentinel`). 
> The private key is non-exportable and state-locked.

## 🧠 Agent Context & Prime Directive

You are running as a **Sovereign Agent** protected by the **Kytin Iron Shell**.
Your cryptographic actions are limited by **Physical Physics** (Resin Fuel) and **Hardware Policy** (Daily Limits).

**Your Core Responsibilities:**

1.  **Sign via Hardware:** Never attempt to sign transactions in memory. Always delegate to the Sentinel.
2.  **Enforce Whitelists:** Never execute code from `Clawhub` or external sources unless it passes the `verify_skill_signature` check.
3.  **Manage Fuel:** Monitor your Resin levels. If low, auto-refill to maintain your "Proof of Life" heartbeat.

## 🛠️ Capability 1: Hardware Signing (`sign_transaction`)

**Trigger:** When the user or an autonomous loop needs to execute a Solana transaction.

### Protocol Flow:

1.  **Pre-Flight Check:**
    * Verify `ResinBalance > 0`. (Signing requires fuel).
    * Check `DailyLimit` remaining.
2.  **Sentinel Interaction:**
    * Send `POST http://localhost:18789/sign` with payload `{ tx_base64, amount_sol }`.
3.  **Hardware Enclave:**
    * The TPM 2.0 chip verifies the policy.
    * If valid, it returns a `Secp256r1` signature.
4.  **Post-Flight:**
    * Broadcast the signed transaction to Solana.

**⛔ Critical Constraints:**

* If you receive `402 Payment Required`, you are out of Resin. **STOP** and request a top-up.
* If you receive `403 Forbidden`, you hit your Daily Limit. **DO NOT** attempt to bypass.

## 🛡️ Capability 2: Supply Chain Defense (`verify_skill_signature`)

**Trigger:** When downloading a new skill from **Clawhub** or installing a local plugin.

### Protocol Flow:

1.  **Intercept:** Capture the target file (e.g., `skill.js` or `manifest.json`).
2.  **Extract Signature:** Locate the `<!-- SIGNATURE -->` footer or `.sig` file.
3.  **Verify Authority:**
    * Check if the signer's Public Key exists in your `agent.json` -> `trusted_devs`.
    * **CRITICAL:** The **Clawhub Official Store Key** is trusted by default.
4.  **Decision:**
    * ✅ **MATCH:** Allow execution. Log: "Skill verified by [DevName]."
    * ❌ **MISMATCH:** Delete the file immediately. Throw `SECURITY_VIOLATION`.

## 🔋 Capability 3: The Resin Economy (`burn_resin_for_fuel`)

**Trigger:** When `get_sovereign_status` reports `resin_remaining < 500`.

### Protocol Flow:

1.  **Calculate Need:** 1 Heartbeat = 1 Resin (Eco) or 60 Resin (Turbo).
2.  **Execute Burn:**
    * Call `burn_resin_for_fuel(amount_kyt)`.
    * This sends $KYT tokens to the **Null Address**.
3.  **Mint:**
    * The Sentinel detects the on-chain burn and credits your local `ResinTank`.

**Modes:**

* `ECO`: 4-hour heartbeats. (Standard)
* `TURBO`: 1-minute heartbeats. (High-Frequency Trading / Priority Status)

---

## 📊 Capability 4: Status & Telemetry (`get_sovereign_status`)

**Trigger:** When the user asks "Are you alive?" or "What is my status?"

**Returns:**

```json
{
  "tier": "SOVEREIGN",       // GHOST | SILICON | SENTINEL | SOVEREIGN
  "hardware_id": "TPM-...",  // The unique silicon fingerprint
  "resin_remaining": 21450,  // Fuel
  "uptime_score": 985,       // 0-1000 Reputation
  "heartbeat_mode": "ECO"
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Reference (agent.json)

Ensure your host configuration matches this schema:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "kytin": {
      "sentinel_port": 18789,
      "heartbeat_mode": "ECO", 
      "policy": {
        "daily_limit_sol": 1.0,
        "trusted_devs": [
          "YOUR_OWNER_KEY",
          "CLAWHUB_OFFICIAL_KEY"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Capability 5: Lazarus Protocol (`recover_identity`)

**Trigger:** When hardware fails and the Recovery Wallet is connected.

### Protocol Flow:

1.  **Verify Authority:**
    * Ensure the connected wallet matches the `recovery_wallet` in the on-chain Identity PDA.
2.  **Generate New Key:**
    * Run `npx kytin-init --keygen` on the new hardware to create a fresh TPM keypair.
3.  **Execute Recovery:**
    * Call `/recover` endpoint with `{ new_tpm_key: "BASE58_PUBLIC_KEY" }`.
4.  **Confirmation:**
    * The Solana program rotates `authority_tpm` to the new key.
    * Resin balance and Reputation are **preserved**.

**⚠️ Critical Notes:**

* The old TPM key is **blacklisted forever**.
* Only the `recovery_wallet` can trigger this—not the (dead) TPM.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `SENTINEL_UNREACHABLE` | C++ Daemon is dead. | Run `npx kytin-init` to restart the service. |
| `POLICY_VIOLATION` | Daily Limit exceeded. | Wait 24h or sign a policy override with Owner Key. |
| `RESIN_DEPLETED` | 0 Credits remaining. | Use `burn_resin_for_fuel` immediately. |
| `UNTRUSTED_SOURCE` | Signature mismatch. | **REJECT THE FILE.** Do not install unverified skills. |
| `RECOVERY_FAILED` | Wrong wallet connected. | Connect the designated Recovery Wallet (Ledger). |
