# Terraform for Konnect

## Goal

Author and maintain Konnect resources in HCL using the official Terraform
provider while preserving the repository's existing module, state, and CI
conventions.

Use this skill for Terraform-managed Konnect work. Do not turn a `kongctl` or
`decK` repository into Terraform unless the user asks for that migration. Do
not treat this skill as the owner for generic backend, state-locking, or
provider-install issues unless they directly block Konnect resource work.

## Tool Positioning

- Use the shared `kong-konnect` MCP server first for live Konnect inspection
  when the requested change depends on current state and MCP is available.
- Use this skill when the repository already uses Terraform for Konnect or the
  user explicitly asks for HCL, Terraform Cloud, plan/apply, or provider-based
  management.
- Preserve existing Terraform layout, backend configuration, module structure,
  and variable conventions.
- Prefer the official `kong/konnect` provider by default and treat
  `kong/konnect-beta` as an explicit exception for missing coverage.
- Hand off to `deck-gateway` when the user wants file-based Gateway GitOps or
  `decK` export/diff workflows.
- Hand off to `kongctl-declarative` when the repository already uses `kongctl`
  YAML instead of HCL.
- Hand off to the relevant Konnect domain skill when the main problem is access,
  publication, runtime health, or another product diagnosis rather than HCL
  ownership.

## References To Load

Load only the reference file that matches the active branch:

- `references/provider-selection.md`
  - Load when deciding whether the official `kong/konnect` provider is enough
    or whether the user explicitly needs `kong/konnect-beta`.
- `references/import-moved-and-adoption.md`
  - Load when existing Konnect resources must be normalized into Terraform
    state rather than recreated.
- `references/module-boundaries.md`
  - Load when the main question is where a new Konnect resource belongs in an
    existing Terraform layout.
- `references/gateway-entities-inside-konnect.md`
  - Load when the task mixes Konnect platform resources with Gateway entities
    inside a Konnect control plane.
- `references/provider-schema-debugging.md`
  - Load when nested resource shape is unclear, validation reports
    object-vs-string or similar type mismatches, or provider behavior does not
    line up cleanly with docs or example HCL.

## Validation Contract

### Preflight

Before writing HCL or proposing a plan:

- Confirm Terraform is installed and runnable: `terraform version`
- Confirm the repo's backend and workspace expectations before editing files
- Confirm Konnect auth is already supplied through secure variables, not
  checked-in literals
- Inspect existing provider blocks, modules, and variable names before writing
  new HCL
- Confirm which module, workspace, and resource addresses own the target
  Konnect slice
- Confirm whether existing live resources must be imported before planning
- Use `terraform providers schema -json` as the default source of truth when
  nested resource shape is unclear before guessing from docs or examples

### Preview

Use Terraform's native preview surface before apply:

- run `terraform fmt -check` only when the repository uses that convention for
  validation
- run `terraform validate`
- run `terraform plan`
- import first when live resources already exist in scope and should be brought
  under state instead of recreated
- check the exact addresses, module boundaries, and create-update-destroy shape
  before considering apply

### Execute

- Describe the intended effect before any mutating command.
- Run `terraform apply` only when the user explicitly asked for live mutation.
- Apply the same workspace, variable set, and module boundary already previewed
  in `plan`.

### Prove

After a requested apply:

- confirm the planned addresses match the intended ownership boundary
- use Terraform-native proof such as `terraform state list`,
  `terraform state show <address>`, relevant outputs, or a follow-up
  `terraform plan` that shows no remaining intended changes
- prove the exact resources touched rather than treating apply success as proof

## Operating Rules

- Preserve the repo's existing Terraform style: root-module layout, child
  modules, variable files, naming, and output shape.
- Keep Konnect credentials in the repo's existing secret path such as
  `KONNECT_TOKEN`, `KONNECT_SPAT`, or workspace-managed variables; never add
  committed literals to `.tf` files.
- Use `terraform providers schema -json` as the default source of truth for
  unknown nested resource shape before guessing HCL from docs or examples.
- Prefer `terraform plan` before `terraform apply` unless the user explicitly
  requests direct execution.
- If `terraform providers schema -json`, provider startup, `terraform validate`,
  or `terraform plan` fails in a way that suggests sandbox interference,
  retry outside the sandbox with approval before treating it as a provider,
  auth, or schema problem.
- Treat Terraform state as authoritative for what it manages. Do not recreate
  resources that should be imported or adopted.
- Keep Gateway entities and surrounding Konnect platform resources in the same
  Terraform approach only when the repository already does so or the user wants
  that composition.
- When the repository already manages only part of Konnect in Terraform, follow
  that boundary instead of broadening scope casually.
- Preserve imports, `moved` blocks, and module addresses when refactoring.
- Avoid mixing one-off UI edits with Terraform-managed resources without
  calling out drift.
- Do not treat a successful `terraform apply` as proof by itself; follow with
  state or plan-based verification of the touched addresses.

## Workflow

### 1. Inspect the Terraform shape

Identify:

- root modules and child modules
- provider aliases and version constraints
- backend configuration and workspace selection
- variable conventions and secrets handling
- whether Konnect resources are already organized by environment, team, or
  control plane

Match the existing shape before adding resources.

### 2. Confirm the Konnect scope

Pin down:

- which Konnect product surface is in scope
- whether the task concerns platform resources, Gateway entities inside a
  Konnect control plane, or both
- whether the request is create, update, import, or drift correction
- whether the repo already manages this Konnect slice in Terraform or the user
  is explicitly choosing Terraform as the implementation path

Do not assume every requested resource belongs in the same module.

Load `references/module-boundaries.md` if ownership between modules,
environments, or product slices is unclear.
Load `references/provider-schema-debugging.md` when resource shape is the main
uncertainty.

### 3. Preview the intended change

Default paths:

- new managed resource: author HCL in the existing module layout
- existing unmanaged resource: prefer import or adoption over recreation
- repo migration from live Gateway entities: use `deck file kong2tf` as the
  default starting point when Gateway config already exists in `decK` or live
  Gateway state
- beta-only feature: use `kong/konnect-beta` only when explicitly required

Use `references/provider-selection.md` for provider choice and
`references/import-moved-and-adoption.md` for state-normalization work.
When HCL shape is unclear, inspect `terraform providers schema -json` before
guessing block or attribute structure.

Preview expectations:

- use `terraform fmt -check` only when the repo expects it
- run `terraform validate`
- run `terraform plan`
- inspect whether the plan touches only the intended module and addresses
- import first if the plan would recreate something that already exists live

### 4. Author HCL with stable ownership boundaries

When writing HCL:

- keep related resources grouped by the repository's current convention
- reuse variables and locals rather than duplicating environment-specific
  literals
- preserve stable names and identifiers where the repo already has them
- add outputs only when downstream modules or CI actually need them

Load `references/gateway-entities-inside-konnect.md` when Gateway entities and
platform resources might belong in different parts of the repo.

### 5. Execute only when requested

- Describe the intended live effect before presenting or running
  `terraform apply`.
- Use the same workspace, variable set, and directory that produced the
  reviewed plan.
- Run `terraform apply` only when the user explicitly asked to mutate live
  Konnect state.

### 6. Prove the result with Terraform-native checks

After any requested `terraform apply`:

- confirm the touched resource addresses now appear in `terraform state list`
- inspect key addresses with `terraform state show <address>` or the repo's
  normal output surface
- when practical, run a follow-up `terraform plan` and expect no remaining
  intended changes for the touched slice
- call out any drift or ownership mismatch instead of hiding it behind apply
  success

### 7. Report both config and state impact

State:

- which files or modules changed
- which Konnect resources are managed or updated
- whether import is required
- whether the next step is `plan`, `apply`, or a separate verification step

## Kong-Specific Gotchas

- `kong/konnect` is the default supported provider; beta coverage should be an
  explicit exception, not the baseline.
- Recreating an existing Konnect resource in Terraform instead of importing it
  can cause avoidable churn and broken references.
- A repository may manage Gateway entities in Terraform while still inspecting
  live state through MCP or `kongctl`; those are complementary, not conflicting.
- Generated `kong2tf` output is a starting point, not a guarantee that the HCL
  matches repo style or ownership boundaries.
- If the repo already standardizes on `kongctl` YAML or `decK`, forcing HCL is
  usually the wrong move unless migration is the task.

## Validation Checklist

Before answering, verify that you can state:

- why Terraform is the right tool for this repository or request
- whether `kong/konnect` or `kong/konnect-beta` is actually needed
- which module or file owns the target resources
- whether import or adoption is required
- which preview commands prove the intended change before mutation
- whether provider schema inspection is needed before guessing nested HCL shape
- whether the change should stop at HCL authoring or continue to `plan/apply`
- how the exact resource addresses will be proved after apply
- whether another tool skill should own the implementation instead

## Handoffs

- Use `deck-gateway` when the user wants Gateway-entity GitOps through `decK`
  rather than Terraform state.
- Use `kongctl-declarative` when the repository already uses `kongctl` YAML for
  Konnect changes.
- Use `konnect-access-scope`, `konnect-api-publish`, `konnect-gateway-triage`,
  or other domain skills when the user first needs diagnosis of the Konnect
  problem rather than HCL authoring.
