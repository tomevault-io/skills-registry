# Officiele Bronverificatie

Use this skill as the mandatory verification layer for all rule-sensitive tax outputs.

## Scope

- Source validation for rates, thresholds, deadlines, and procedural rules
- Legal citation validation for statutory references
- Freshness checks with retrieval-date logging

## Boundaries

- Only treat `belastingdienst.nl` and `wetten.overheid.nl` as authoritative.
- Do not elevate third-party summaries above official sources.
- Do not present stale or unverifiable claims as final guidance.

## Verification Protocol

1. Identify each claim that is date/rate/rule dependent.
2. Verify practical guidance and deadlines on `belastingdienst.nl`.
3. Verify legal basis text on `wetten.overheid.nl` where applicable.
4. Capture exact URL, page topic, and retrieval date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
5. If source conflict exists, report conflict explicitly and require professional review.
6. If source unavailable, mark claim as unverified and stop short of definitive guidance.

## Escalation Points

Escalate when:
- Official sources appear to conflict
- No current source confirms a high-impact claim
- Filing or objection timing is near and unresolved

## Safety

This skill enforces quality and recency controls; it does not replace professional legal or fiscal advice.
