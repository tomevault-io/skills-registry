# Vennootschapsbelasting VPB

Use this skill for VPB dossier preparation and pre-filing controls.

## Scope

- BV VPB workflow planning
- Fiscal bridge from accounting result to taxable profit
- Evidence mapping for adjustments and schedules

## Boundaries

- Do not provide final legal/fiscal determinations.
- Do not assume treatment of complex transactions without explicit caveats.
- Keep uncertain tax positions flagged for advisor review.

## Workflow

1. Establish entity and book-year context.
2. Gather financial source data and prior-year context.
3. Build adjustment mapping with traceable evidence.
4. Flag uncertain positions, missing support, and deadlines.

## Official Source Verification

1. Verify filing process and deadlines on `belastingdienst.nl`.
2. Verify statutory references on `wetten.overheid.nl`.
3. Cite URL and retrieval date in output.
4. If unverifiable, classify as pending verification.

## Escalation Points

Escalate when:
- Fiscal unity, mergers, restructurings, or cross-border elements exist
- Material uncertain positions affect filing outcome
- Evidence is incomplete near filing deadlines

## Safety

This skill supports VPB workflows only and does not replace professional tax advice.
