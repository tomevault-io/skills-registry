# Using GitHub API with gh CLI

The `gh` CLI doesn't have first-class support for inline/in-code pull request review comments (the line/thread comments on the "Files changed" tab). This skill shows how to access these and other GitHub data programmatically using `gh api`.

## What This Skill Does

- Access inline PR review comments
- Get review thread status (resolved/unresolved)
- Reply to inline review comments
- Resolve and unresolve review threads
- Use GitHub's REST API via gh api
- Use GitHub's GraphQL API via gh api
- Extract owner/repo/PR number from URLs
- Filter and query PR review data

## When You Need This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Standard `gh pr view` doesn't show the data you need
- You need inline/line-specific review comments from "Files changed" tab
- You need to check if review threads are resolved/unresolved
- You need to programmatically process review data

For day-to-day gh usage (viewing PRs, creating PRs, finding branch names), see the gh CLI section in CLAUDE.md.

## Prerequisites

1. **gh CLI installed** - Already available as `gh`
2. **Authenticated with GitHub** - Run `gh auth status` to verify
3. **jq** - For parsing JSON output (optional but recommended)

## Core Concepts

### What gh Commands Show vs Don't Show

**`gh pr view` shows:**
- PR conversation comments
- Review summaries
- Overall PR metadata

**`gh pr view` does NOT show:**
- Inline review comments (line-specific comments)
- Review thread resolved/unresolved status
- Code diff context for comments

**Use `gh api` when you need** the data that `gh pr view` doesn't provide.

### REST API vs GraphQL API

**REST API:**
- Simple for basic inline comment retrieval
- Returns arrays of comment objects
- Good for straightforward queries

**GraphQL API:**
- Better for complex queries
- Returns thread structure with resolved status
- Can fetch everything in one query
- Provides `isResolved` and `isOutdated` fields

## REST API Usage

### Get All Inline Review Comments for a PR

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments \
  -q '.[] | {id, path, line, body: .body, user: .user.login, created_at}'
```

**Endpoint:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments`

**Returns:** Array of comment objects with:
- `id` - Comment ID
- `path` - File path
- `line` - Line number
- `body` - Comment text
- `user.login` - Author username
- `created_at` - Timestamp

**Reference:** [REST API endpoints for pull request review comments](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/comments)

### Get Inline Comments for a Specific Review

```bash
# First get reviews for the PR to find REVIEW_ID
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/reviews -q '.[].id'

# Then list the inline comments for one review
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/reviews/REVIEW_ID/comments \
  -q '.[] | {id, path, line, body: .body, author: .user.login}'
```

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/reviews` (list reviews)
- `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/reviews/{review_id}/comments` (list comments)

**Reference:** [REST API endpoints for pull request reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/reviews)

### Get PR Conversation Comments (Non-Inline)

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/PR_NUMBER/comments \
  -q '.[] | {id, body: .body, author: .user.login}'
```

**Note:** PR conversation comments use the Issues API endpoint, not Pulls.

**Endpoint:** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}/comments`

**Reference:** [REST API endpoints for issue comments](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/comments)

## GraphQL API Usage

### Get All Review Threads with Resolved Status

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $number:Int!, $n:Int=100) {
    repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
      pullRequest(number:$number) {
        reviewThreads(first:$n) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            isOutdated
            comments(first:$n) {
              nodes {
                databaseId
                bodyText
                path
                diffHunk
                author { login }
                createdAt
                url
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }' -F owner=OWNER -F repo=REPO -F number=PR_NUMBER
```

**Key Fields:**
- `isResolved` - Whether the thread is marked as resolved
- `isOutdated` - Whether the thread is outdated due to code changes
- `diffHunk` - The code context for the comment
- `path` - File path
- `bodyText` - Comment content

**Reference:** [GraphQL API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql)

## When to Use REST vs GraphQL

### Use REST when:

- You just need inline comments (body, path/line, author, timestamps)
- You want simplicity and speed
- You're fetching data from a single PR
- You don't need resolved/unresolved status

### Use GraphQL when:

- You need thread structure and resolved/unresolved status
- You need `isOutdated` flags
- You want to fetch everything in one query
- REST doesn't expose the metadata you need
- You're building complex queries across related data

## Responding to Review Comments

### Reply to an Inline Comment

```bash
# Get comment IDs first
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments --jq '.[] | "\(.id) \(.path):\(.line)"'

# Reply to a specific comment
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments/COMMENT_ID/replies \
  -X POST -f body="Done. Fixed in latest commit."
```

**Endpoint:** `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies`

**Reference:** [Create a reply for a review comment](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/comments#create-a-reply-for-a-review-comment)

### Resolve a Review Thread

Review threads can only be resolved via GraphQL. First get the thread ID, then resolve it:

```bash
# Get thread IDs (note: these start with PRRT_)
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 10) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes {
              body
              path
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'

# Resolve the thread
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "PRRT_kwDOxxxxxx"}) {
    thread {
      isResolved
    }
  }
}'
```

**Note:** The `threadId` is the GraphQL node ID (starts with `PRRT_`), not the REST API comment ID.

### Unresolve a Review Thread

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  unresolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "PRRT_kwDOxxxxxx"}) {
    thread {
      isResolved
    }
  }
}'
```

### Reply and Resolve in Sequence

A common workflow is to reply to feedback explaining what you did, then resolve the thread:

```bash
# 1. Reply to the comment (REST)
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments/COMMENT_ID/replies \
  -X POST -f body="Done. Created shared BigQuery bean."

# 2. Resolve the thread (GraphQL)
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "PRRT_kwDOxxxxxx"}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}'
```

## Common Use Cases

### List All Unresolved Review Threads

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $number:Int!) {
    repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
      pullRequest(number:$number) {
        reviewThreads(first:100) {
          nodes {
            isResolved
            comments(first:1) {
              nodes {
                path
                bodyText
                author { login }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }' -F owner=OWNER -F repo=REPO -F number=PR_NUMBER \
  | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false)'
```

### Get All Comments by a Specific Reviewer

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments \
  | jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "username") | {path, line, body: .body}'
```

### Count Total Inline Comments

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments | jq '. | length'
```

### Get Comments with Specific Text

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments \
  | jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("TODO")) | {path, line, body: .body}'
```

## Extracting URL Components

### From PR URL

```bash
# From: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
PR_URL="https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123"

# Extract owner
OWNER=$(echo "$PR_URL" | cut -d'/' -f4)

# Extract repo
REPO=$(echo "$PR_URL" | cut -d'/' -f5)

# Extract PR number
PR_NUMBER=$(echo "$PR_URL" | cut -d'/' -f7)
```

### Using gh to Parse URL

```bash
gh pr view "$PR_URL" --json number,repository \
  -q '{number: .number, owner: .repository.owner.login, repo: .repository.name}'
```

This is more robust as it handles different URL formats.

## Examples

### Example 1: Get All Inline Comments for a PR

```bash
# User: "Show me all inline review comments on PR #123"

OWNER="food-truck"
REPO="mono"
PR_NUMBER="123"

gh api repos/${OWNER}/${REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/comments \
  -q '.[] | "[\(.path):\(.line)] @\(.user.login): \(.body)"'
```

### Example 2: Find Unresolved Comments

```bash
# User: "What review comments are still unresolved on that PR?"

PR_URL="https://github.com/food-truck/mono/pull/123"

# Parse URL
OWNER=$(echo "$PR_URL" | cut -d'/' -f4)
REPO=$(echo "$PR_URL" | cut -d'/' -f5)
PR_NUMBER=$(echo "$PR_URL" | cut -d'/' -f7)

# Get unresolved threads
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $number:Int!) {
    repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
      pullRequest(number:$number) {
        reviewThreads(first:100) {
          nodes {
            isResolved
            comments(first:1) {
              nodes {
                path
                bodyText
                author { login }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }' -F owner=${OWNER} -F repo=${REPO} -F number=${PR_NUMBER} \
  | jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false) | .comments.nodes[0] | "[\(.path)] @\(.author.login): \(.bodyText)"'
```

### Example 3: Get My Comments on a PR

```bash
# User: "What comments did I leave on PR #123?"

MY_USERNAME=$(gh api user -q '.login')

gh api repos/food-truck/mono/pulls/123/comments \
  | jq --arg user "$MY_USERNAME" '.[] | select(.user.login == $user) | {path, line, body: .body}'
```

### Example 4: Summary of Review Activity

```bash
# User: "Give me a summary of review activity on PR #123"

PR_NUMBER="123"
OWNER="food-truck"
REPO="mono"

# Total comments
TOTAL=$(gh api repos/${OWNER}/${REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/comments | jq '. | length')

# Comments by reviewer
echo "Total inline comments: $TOTAL"
echo ""
echo "By reviewer:"
gh api repos/${OWNER}/${REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/comments \
  | jq -r '.[] | .user.login' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

## Verification

### Check gh Authentication

```bash
# Verify you're authenticated
gh auth status

# Expected output shows authenticated user and scopes
```

### Test API Access

```bash
# Test REST API access
gh api user -q '.login'

# Should return your GitHub username
```

### Verify Repository Access

```bash
# Check if you can access a repo
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO -q '.name'

# Should return the repo name
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Could not resolve to a Repository"

**Cause**: Incorrect owner/repo, or no access to repository

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify owner and repo names
gh repo view OWNER/REPO

# Check if you have access
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO -q '.name'

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

### Issue: "Resource not accessible by integration"

**Cause**: Missing scopes in authentication token

**Solution**:
```bash
# Re-authenticate with required scopes
gh auth login --scopes repo,read:org

# Check current scopes
gh auth status
```

### Issue: Empty results for inline comments

**Cause**: PR has no inline comments, or querying wrong endpoint

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify PR has inline comments by viewing in browser

# Check you're using pulls endpoint, not issues
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments

# For conversation comments, use issues endpoint
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/PR_NUMBER/comments
```

### Issue: GraphQL query syntax error

**Cause**: Malformed GraphQL query

**Solution**:
```bash
# Test query structure with simpler query first
gh api graphql -f query='
  query {
    viewer { login }
  }'

# Add complexity incrementally
# Check GitHub GraphQL Explorer for query validation
```

### Issue: Rate limiting

**Cause**: Too many API requests

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check rate limit status
gh api rate_limit

# Wait for rate limit reset
# Or use GraphQL (higher rate limits)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Parse URLs with gh when possible**
   - `gh pr view URL --json` is more robust than string parsing
   - Handles different URL formats automatically

2. **Use GraphQL for complex queries**
   - Single query vs multiple REST calls
   - Better for resolved/unresolved status
   - Higher rate limits

3. **Cache results locally**
   - API calls count against rate limits
   - Save results to file for repeated analysis

4. **Use jq for filtering**
   - Filter on client side to reduce API calls
   - Build up complex jq queries incrementally

5. **Check authentication first**
   - Always verify `gh auth status` before debugging
   - Saves time troubleshooting permission issues

6. **Use -q flag with gh api**
   - Provides cleaner output
   - Can extract specific fields directly

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Get inline PR comments (REST)
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments

# Get comment IDs with file/line info
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments --jq '.[] | "\(.id) \(.path):\(.line)"'

# Reply to a comment (REST)
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments/COMMENT_ID/replies -X POST -f body="Done."

# Get thread IDs and resolved status (GraphQL)
gh api graphql -f query='query { repository(owner:"OWNER", name:"REPO") { pullRequest(number:PR_NUMBER) { reviewThreads(first:10) { nodes { id isResolved } } } } }'

# Resolve a thread (GraphQL)
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:"PRRT_xxx"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'

# Unresolve a thread (GraphQL)
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { unresolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:"PRRT_xxx"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'

# Parse PR URL
gh pr view URL --json number,repository

# Count comments
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments | jq '. | length'

# Filter by author
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments | jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "username")'

# Check rate limits
gh api rate_limit
```
