# pptx-azure

Azure-specific assets for PowerPoint presentations.

**Prerequisite:** Use in conjunction with the [pptx skill](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/pptx/SKILL.md) for core PowerPoint workflows (reading, editing, creating presentations).

## Recommended Workflow

**Start here:** Before creating a PowerPoint, use the `/doc-coauthoring` skill to create a markdown spec first.

```
Phase 1: Context Gathering    →  /doc-coauthoring skill
         (Back-and-forth to gather requirements, create markdown spec)
                              ↓
Phase 2: Validation           →  Review against slides/ guides
         (Ensure each slide follows best practices)
                              ↓
Phase 3: Slide-by-Slide       →  Build PPTX incrementally
         (Create one slide at a time, user reviews each)
```

See [workflow.md](workflow.md) for the complete process.

**Key principle:** Create the markdown spec FIRST, validate it, THEN build the PPTX slide-by-slide with user collaboration.

### Template

Use [templates/presentation-spec.md](templates/presentation-spec.md) for the markdown spec:

```markdown
## Slide N: [Action Title]

**Type:** [Title | Section header | Content | Architecture | Data/Chart | Comparison | Summary]

**Key Message:** [One sentence takeaway]

**Content:**
- [Verbose content - will be trimmed later]

**Visuals:**

Description: [What the visual shows]

```mermaid
[Mermaid diagram representing the visual]
```

**Speaker Notes:** [Detailed notes on what presenter will say]
```

### Agent Responsibilities During Co-authoring

When using `/doc-coauthoring` to create the markdown spec, the agent should:

1. **Ask clarifying questions** - Understand audience, goals, key messages
2. **Proactively draft speaker notes** - Don't wait for the user to write these; propose them based on context
3. **Create Mermaid diagrams** - For any visual (architecture, flowchart, sequence), create a Mermaid representation
4. **Iterate collaboratively** - Refine content, visuals, and speaker notes with the user

The agent generates the speaker notes and Mermaid diagrams based on user requirements - the user provides the ideas, the agent drafts the details.

### Slide-by-Slide Creation

When building the PPTX:

1. **Always re-read the PPTX before editing** - user may have manually edited
2. Create/update one slide at a time
3. Present to user for review
4. Iterate until approved, then move to next slide
5. Handle additions, removals, and reordering as needed

### Per-Slide Checklist

For each slide, ensure:

- [ ] **Title** matches the action title from the markdown spec
- [ ] **Key message** is clear and matches the spec
- [ ] **Content** is trimmed down from verbose spec to concise slide
- [ ] **Visuals** are included and aligned (icons, diagrams, charts)
- [ ] **Speaker notes** are added to the slide (from the spec's Speaker Notes field)
- [ ] **Layout** follows visual hierarchy principles
- [ ] **Colors** use Azure palette consistently
- [ ] **Icons** are from the official Azure icon set

**Speaker notes are critical** - they contain what the presenter will say verbally. Always transfer speaker notes from the markdown spec to the actual PPTX slide.

| Creating an Azure architecture diagram | [architecture/diagrams.md](architecture/diagrams.md) |
| Presenting to executives or leadership | [slides/executive-communication.md](slides/executive-communication.md) |
| Building a pitch deck or persuasive presentation | [slides/storytelling-structure.md](slides/storytelling-structure.md) |
| Reviewing slides that feel cluttered or wordy | [slides/less-is-more.md](slides/less-is-more.md) |

## Quick Reference

### Icons

**Path:** `icons/Azure_Public_Service_Icons/Icons/<category>/<icon>.svg`

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| ai + machine learning | Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services, Machine Learning |

**Using SVG icons in PowerPoint:**
- PowerPoint 2019+ supports SVG directly: Insert > Pictures > select SVG file
- For older versions, convert SVG to PNG or EMF first
- Recommended size: 64x64 px for inline icons, larger for featured elements
- Do not stretch, distort, or recolor official Azure icons

## Slide Design Guides

Based on established frameworks: McKinsey/BCG consulting style, Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle, Garr Reynolds' Presentation Zen, Nancy Duarte's Slide:ology and Resonate.

| Guide | When to Use | Key Principle |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| [one-idea-per-slide.md](slides/one-idea-per-slide.md) | Slide feels overloaded or confusing | Each slide conveys exactly one message |
| [action-titles.md](slides/action-titles.md) | Writing or reviewing slide titles | Titles state the takeaway, not just the topic |
| [visual-hierarchy.md](slides/visual-hierarchy.md) | Laying out slide content | Guide the eye with size, contrast, white space |
| [less-is-more.md](slides/less-is-more.md) | Slides have too much text | Cut ruthlessly; apply 10/20/30 rule |
| [storytelling-structure.md](slides/storytelling-structure.md) | Building a persuasive narrative | Create story arc, not information dump |
| [executive-communication.md](slides/executive-communication.md) | Presenting to leadership | Lead with conclusion (Pyramid Principle) |

## Architecture Diagrams

When creating Azure architecture diagrams, read [architecture/diagrams.md](architecture/diagrams.md). Key points:

- **Always use directional arrows** - lines without arrows are ambiguous
- **Label everything** - icons, containers, relationships
- **Be accurate** - don't show PaaS in a subnet if it uses private endpoint
- **Layer, don't overload** - use multiple diagrams at different detail levels
- **Include metadata** - title, date, author, version
