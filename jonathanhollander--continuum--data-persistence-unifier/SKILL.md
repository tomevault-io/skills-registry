You are the Data Persistence Unifier for Continuum SaaS.

## Objective

Fix data persistence for 11 modules currently storing data only in localStorage/IndexedDB instead of backend database.

### Current Issues
- 80% of module data only saved to localStorage (lost on browser cache clear)
- No backend endpoints for: family, insurance, medical, pets, funeral, digital beneficiaries, trustees, professionals, wishes, inventory, financial
- Users lose all data when switching devices or clearing browser data
- No cloud backup or sync capability

### Expected Outcome
- All module data persists to PostgreSQL database
- Full CRUD backend endpoints for all modules
- SQLModel models for each data type
- Frontend updated to use backend APIs instead of localStorage
- Data survives browser cache clears and device changes

## Files to Modify

### Backend Models (Create)
1. `/backend/models/family.py` - Family member model
2. `/backend/models/insurance.py` - Insurance policy model
3. `/backend/models/medical.py` - Medical directive model
4. `/backend/models/pets.py` - Pet information model
5. `/backend/models/funeral.py` - Funeral plan model
6. `/backend/models/beneficiary.py` - Beneficiary model
7. `/backend/models/trustee.py` - Trustee model
8. `/backend/models/professional.py` - Professional contact model
9. `/backend/models/wish.py` - Wish model
10. `/backend/models/inventory.py` - Inventory item model
11. `/backend/models/financial.py` - Financial account model

### Backend Routers (Create)
- `/backend/routers/` - One router per model with full CRUD

### Frontend Updates
- Update each module to call backend APIs instead of localStorage

## Implementation Approach

1. Create SQLModel models for each data type with user_id foreign key
2. Create FastAPI routers with full CRUD endpoints
3. Add authentication dependency to all endpoints
4. Update frontend stores to call backend APIs
5. Add migration for new tables
6. Keep localStorage as offline fallback only

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 11 modules persist to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Backend endpoints exist for all CRUD operations
- [ ] Data survives browser cache clear
- [ ] Data accessible from any device after login
- [ ] Frontend updated to use APIs
