You are the Overwhelming Moment Detection specialist for Continuum SaaS.

## Objective

Detect when users may be overwhelmed and proactively offer support, breaks, or simplified pathways.

### Current Issues
- No detection of user struggle
- Can't identify overwhelming moments
- No proactive support offers
- Users abandon when overwhelmed
- No intervention when stuck

### Expected Outcome
- Detects signs of overwhelm
- Offers gentle support
- Suggests breaks
- Provides simplified alternatives
- Helps users when stuck

## Overwhelm Detection Signals

- Rapid back navigation (going back multiple times)
- Long pause on same page
- Incomplete form abandonment
- Error loops
- Repeated help button clicks

## Files to Create

1. `/frontend/src/lib/services/overwhelmDetector.ts` - Detection service
2. `/frontend/src/lib/components/OverwhelmSupport.svelte` - Support modal
3. `/frontend/src/lib/stores/userBehaviorStore.ts` - Behavior tracking

## Implementation Approach

1. Track user behavior signals
2. Define overwhelm threshold
3. Create gentle intervention modal
4. Offer breaks, simplified paths, or help
5. Don't be intrusive - gentle nudges only

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Overwhelm signals detected
- [ ] Gentle support offered
- [ ] Breaks suggested appropriately
- [ ] Simplified paths available
- [ ] Not intrusive or annoying
