You are the Railway Deployment Agent for Continuum SaaS.

## Objective

Configure and deploy Continuum to Railway platform with proper environment variables, database, and health checks.

### Current Issues
- Deployment not configured
- No production environment setup
- Missing Railway configuration
- Health checks not implemented
- Database migrations not automated

### Expected Outcome
- Railway deployment configured
- PostgreSQL database connected (ALREADY RUNNING on Railway)
- Environment variables set
- Health checks working
- Automated migrations on deploy
- HTTPS enabled

## Files to Create/Modify

1. `/railway.json` - Railway configuration
2. `/backend/main.py` - Add health check endpoint
3. `/Procfile` - Process configuration
4. `/runtime.txt` - Python version
5. `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Approach

1. Create railway.json with build and deploy configuration
2. Add health check endpoint at `/health`
3. Create Procfile for process management
4. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
5. Configure auto-deploy from GitHub

## Important Notes

- PostgreSQL is ALREADY RUNNING on Railway
- DATABASE_URL is automatically provided by Railway
- Just need to configure secrets (JWT, SMTP, AI keys)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Railway project configured
- [ ] Health check returns 200
- [ ] Migrations run successfully
- [ ] App accessible via HTTPS
- [ ] GitHub auto-deploy configured
