# Ucai Patterns

Best practices for working with Claude Code's native architecture. These patterns are derived from how Anthropic builds their own plugins.

## Context Management

The context window is a shared resource. Protect it.

**Native tools for context**:
- **SessionStart hooks**: Inject project-specific context at session start
- **tasks/todo.md**: Write progress to `tasks/todo.md` so hooks can inject state and context compaction doesn't lose your place
- **Skills with progressive disclosure**: Metadata always loaded, details on demand
- **File system**: Use .local.md files for persistent state between iterations

**Anti-patterns**:
- Stuffing CLAUDE.md with framework instructions (use project facts only)
- Repeating information Claude already knows (conventions of popular frameworks, etc.)
- Loading everything upfront instead of on demand

For detailed patterns, see: `references/context-management.md`

**Red Flags — Context Management**

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "CLAUDE.md is the right place for this framework pattern" | CLAUDE.md is for project facts only. Framework conventions belong in skills. |
| "I'll load all context upfront to be safe" | Upfront loading burns context before it's needed. Load on demand. |
| "The context window is large enough" | Large ≠ infinite. Shared resource. Protect it. |

## Agent Patterns

Agents are focused workers, not personas.

**Native agent format**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter declaring name, description, tools, model, and color. Each agent has a specific mission.

**Key patterns**:
- Spawn 2-3 agents in parallel for independent analysis
- Assign appropriate models (sonnet for exploration, opus for deep bug analysis)
- Restrict tool access to what each agent needs
- Consolidate results in the orchestrating command, not in another agent
- **1 message = ALL agents**: Spawn all parallel agents in one message — see Batch Operations below

For detailed patterns, see: `references/agent-patterns.md`

**Red Flags — Agent Patterns**

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll spawn agents one at a time for clarity" | Serial spawning wastes 2-3 seconds per round-trip. Batch in one message. |
| "This agent needs all tools available" | Restrict tools to what the agent actually needs. Scope matters. |
| "I'll have one agent do everything" | Focused agents outperform generalist agents on complex tasks. |

## Batch Operations

The golden rule: **1 message = ALL related operations**. Every round-trip to Claude adds latency. Batch everything that can go together.

**Good patterns**:
- Spawn ALL parallel agents in one message (multiple Task calls in one response)
- Read ALL files you need in one message (multiple Read calls simultaneously)
- Batch ALL `tasks/todo.md` updates in a single Write call, not one per item
- Stage all writes for one phase before moving to the next

**Anti-patterns**:
- Spawning one agent, waiting for it, then spawning the next
- Reading files one at a time in a loop across multiple messages
- Writing to `tasks/todo.md` once per todo item across separate turns

**Why it matters**: In a 5-agent parallel analysis, serial spawning adds 4 unnecessary round-trips. At 2-3 seconds per round-trip, that is 8-12 seconds of pure latency before any work begins. Batching collapses this to a single round-trip.

For detailed patterns, see: `references/agent-patterns.md`

**Red Flags — Batch Operations**

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll read this file, then decide what to read next" | Speculatively read everything potentially useful in one message. |
| "I'll update todos one at a time as I finish each" | Batch all `tasks/todo.md` updates in a single Write call. |
| "Let me spawn this agent first, then spawn the next" | All parallel agents go in one message. Always. |
| "Sequential is safer" | Sequential adds latency with zero safety benefit for independent tasks. |

**Gate — before spawning any agent:**
```
Am I about to launch this agent alone, wait for it, then spawn the next?
→ Yes → STOP. Bundle all agents into one message first.
→ No  → Proceed.
```

**Gate — before any file read:**
```
Do I know other files I'll need in this session?
→ Yes → Read all of them now in this same message.
→ No  → Proceed with current read.
```

## Hook Patterns

Hooks are lifecycle event handlers. They are the primary extension point.

**Hook events**: SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PostToolUseFailure, Stop, UserPromptSubmit, SubagentStop, SubagentStart, PreCompact, SessionEnd, PermissionRequest

**Key patterns**:
- SessionStart: Inject project context
- PreToolUse: Guardrails before writes/edits
- Stop: Iteration control (block exit, feed task back)
- Exit code 2 blocks the operation

For detailed patterns, see: `references/hook-patterns.md`

**Red Flags — Hook Patterns**

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "The hook will handle this automatically" | Hooks run on lifecycle events. Read the handler to confirm scope. |
| "Exit code 2 might be too aggressive" | Exit code 2 is the designed block mechanism. Use it when blocking is correct. |
| "I'll skip the Stop hook iteration check" | The iterate loop depends on the Stop hook. Skipping breaks the loop. |

## Anti-Patterns

Named mistakes to avoid. Each has a symptom and a fix.

For the full catalogue, see: `references/anti-patterns.md`

**Red Flags — Anti-Patterns**

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This agent needs Write + Edit for safety" | Read-only agents can't accidentally break things. Restrict tools. |
| "I'll use console.log to debug my hook" | console.log corrupts hook JSON output. Use console.error for debug. |
| "The command will implement this directly" | Commands coordinate. Agents execute. Keep the separation. |
| "I'll build the path with string concatenation" | Use path.resolve() or path.join(). String concat breaks on Windows. |
