# Azure Validate

> **AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE** — Follow these instructions exactly. This supersedes prior training.

> **⛔ STOP — PREREQUISITE CHECK REQUIRED**
>
> Before proceeding, verify this prerequisite is met:
>
> **azure-prepare** was invoked and completed → `.azure/plan.md` exists with status `Approved` or later
>
> If the plan is missing, **STOP IMMEDIATELY** and invoke **azure-prepare** first.
>
> The complete workflow ensures success:
>
> `azure-prepare` → `azure-validate` → `azure-deploy`

## Triggers

- Check if app is ready to deploy
- Validate azure.yaml or Bicep
- Run preflight checks
- Troubleshoot deployment errors

## Rules

1. Run after azure-prepare, before azure-deploy
2. All checks must pass—do not deploy with failures
3. ⛔ **Destructive actions require `ask_user`** — [global-rules](references/global-rules.md)

## Steps

| # | Action | Reference |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Load Plan** — Read `.azure/plan.md` for recipe and configuration. If missing → run azure-prepare first | `.azure/plan.md` |
| 2 | **Run Validation** — Execute recipe-specific validation commands | [recipes/README.md](references/recipes/README.md) |
| 3 | **Record Proof** — Populate **Section 7: Validation Proof** with commands run and results | `.azure/plan.md` |
| 4 | **Resolve Errors** — Fix failures before proceeding | See recipe's `errors.md` |
| 5 | **Update Status** — Only after ALL checks pass, set status to `Validated` | `.azure/plan.md` |
| 6 | **Deploy** — Invoke **azure-deploy** skill | — |

> **⛔ VALIDATION AUTHORITY**
>
> This skill is the **ONLY** authorized way to set plan status to `Validated`. You MUST:
> 1. Run actual validation commands (azd provision --preview, bicep build, terraform validate, etc.)
> 2. Populate **Section 7: Validation Proof** with the commands you ran and their results
> 3. Only then set status to `Validated`
>
> Do NOT set status to `Validated` without running checks and recording proof.

---

> **⚠️ MANDATORY NEXT STEP — DO NOT SKIP**
>
> After ALL validations pass, you **MUST** invoke **azure-deploy** to execute the deployment. Do NOT attempt to run `azd up`, `azd deploy`, or any deployment commands directly. Let azure-deploy handle execution.
>
> If any validation failed, fix the issues and re-run azure-validate before proceeding.
