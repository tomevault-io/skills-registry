# PR Review Skill

Provide a clear, concise, and actionable review of Pull Requests. Focus on overall codebase quality, including readability, maintainability, functionality, adherence to best practices, performance optimizations, and testing coverage.

## Focus Areas

1. **Code Quality:** Assess readability, organization, and maintainability.
2. **Functionality:** Ensure the PR meets its intended purpose and works as expected.
3. **Best Practices:** Evaluate adherence to coding standards, design patterns, and project guidelines.
4. **Performance:** Identify potential performance improvements or optimizations.
5. **Testing:** Review the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of test coverage.
6. **Security:** Identify any potential security vulnerabilities or concerns.
7. **Bugs Found:** List any bugs identified in the PR.

## Critical Instructions

- If you have nothing to say about a particular section, omit it from the review.
- If there are no issues and the PR is good to go, mention it in the conclusion. No unnecessary feedback.
- Avoid minor nitpicks and repetitive feedback.

## Scoring Criteria
