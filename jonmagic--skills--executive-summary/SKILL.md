name: executive-summary
description: Create formal executive summaries from GitHub conversations or meeting transcripts. Use when generating leadership-ready summaries that distill key decisions, alternatives, outcomes, and next steps from complex conversations or meetings. Supports GitHub issues/PRs and transcript URIs (Zoom, Teams, etc.). Outputs are saved to Executive Summaries/ with date-organized structure, and source inputs are archived to Transcripts/ with matching naming. Use when this capability is needed.

# Executive Summary Skill

Create formal, narrative-driven executive summaries for leadership and stakeholders. This skill handles two primary workflows: synthesizing GitHub conversations (issues, pull requests, discussions) and distilling meeting transcripts (Zoom, Teams, etc.) into concise, decision-focused summaries.

## Related Skills

**Use `brain-operating-system` skill** for:
- Output directory structure and naming conventions (`Executive Summaries/YYYY-MM-DD/`, `Transcripts/YYYY-MM-DD/`)
- Date folder creation patterns and file numbering

**Use `voice-and-tone` skill** for:
- Narrative construction and paragraph patterns
- First-person framing when appropriate
- Crediting collaborators and showing impact

**Use `github-interaction` skill** for:
- Fetching complete GitHub conversations (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Comment and review retrieval patterns
- Pagination handling

## Core Principles

All executive summaries follow these unifying principles, regardless of source:

### Narrative-Driven Prose

- Structure content as **dense, logically-connected paragraphs** in formal, authoritative tone
- Avoid bullet points, subheaders, or lists
- Each paragraph builds on the previous, conveying a cohesive narrative of evolution from initial topic through decisions and next steps
- Limit length to **3–5 structured paragraphs** (GitHub summaries may run longer for complex decisions)

### Impact & Decision Focus

- Include **only details that significantly influenced direction, decisions, or outcomes**
- Omit administrative commentary, routine pleasantries, subscription messages, procedural remarks, superficial technical minutiae (code diffs, exact timestamps), or automation events
- Center on **key debates, decisions, constraints, resolutions, and business/user impact**
- Clearly articulate **alternatives explored, current status, next steps, and individual responsibilities**

### Contextual Linking

- Every piece of cited information must link to its source
- Attribute statements to individuals by name (no @ symbol on names themselves)
- Links follow the statement or are integrated into sentences
- Ensure readers can drill into source material for deeper context

### Formal Tone & Authority

- Use complete, well-structured sentences
- Integrate all references and links seamlessly without extraneous formatting
- Write for educated, time-constrained readers

## Workflow: GitHub Conversations

For GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions:

1. **Fetch the complete conversation** using the [`github-interaction` skill](../github-interaction/SKILL.md). This ensures you capture all comments, reviews, and state changes necessary for context.

2. **Identify the narrative arc**: What was the initial problem/request? How did the conversation evolve? What decisions were made?

3. **Apply the rules from [references/github-conversations.md](references/github-conversations.md)**, which details:
   - How to structure GitHub-specific summaries
   - Linking patterns for comments, events, and status changes
   - Handling alternative solutions and partial resolutions
   - Ignoring bot-generated events

4. **Archive the source conversation** to `Transcripts/YYYY-MM-DD/##.md` (use today's date; sequential numbering within each date folder). Format as markdown with the issue/PR title, metadata, body, and all comments preserved.

5. **Save the summary** to `Executive Summaries/YYYY-MM-DD/##.md` (use today's date; sequential numbering within each date folder)

## Workflow: Meeting Transcripts

For Zoom, Teams, or other meeting transcripts:

1. **Fetch the transcript** from the provided URI using HTTP or platform-specific tools

2. **Parse and prepare the transcript**: Extract speaker attributions, timestamps, and key discussion points

3. **Apply the rules from [references/transcript-summaries.md](references/transcript-summaries.md)**, which details:
   - Attribution patterns for named participants
   - How to reference shared documents or screens
   - Handling decisions and action items
   - Appropriate scope and constraints for transcript summaries

4. **Archive the source transcript** to `Transcripts/YYYY-MM-DD/##.md` (use today's date; sequential numbering within each date folder). Preserve the full transcript text with speaker attributions.

5. **Save the summary** to `Executive Summaries/YYYY-MM-DD/##.md` (use today's date; sequential numbering within each date folder)

## Quick Reference: Which Workflow?

| Source | Use This Workflow | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub issue, PR, discussion URL | GitHub Conversations | Fetch using `github-interaction` skill; apply GitHub-specific rules |
| Zoom/Teams transcript or recording URI | Meeting Transcripts | Fetch transcript; parse for speakers; apply transcript-specific rules |
| Email thread, Slack conversation | GitHub Conversations (adapted) | If available as a GitHub discussion or converted to one, use GitHub workflow; otherwise, treat as narrative text input |

## Tips for Quality Summaries

- **Start by understanding the arc**: Skim the conversation or transcript to understand the trajectory before drafting
- **Prioritize decision impact**: What changed as a result of this conversation? Lead with that
- **Use participant names strategically**: Name decision-makers and key contributors; anonymize or skip minor commenters
- **Link judiciously but comprehensively**: Every claim should be traceable; avoid standalone links
- **Edit for density**: Remove connecting words, tighten sentences, but preserve clarity

## Source Archival

Source materials (GitHub conversations, meeting transcripts) are archived to `Transcripts/YYYY-MM-DD/##.md` for future reference. These archives:

- **Follow the same naming pattern** as executive summaries (`YYYY-MM-DD/##.md`) but are stored independently
- **Are not necessarily paired 1:1** with executive summaries - a transcript may exist without a summary, or vice versa
- **Can be referenced from anywhere** in the brain: Meeting Notes, Weekly Notes, Daily Projects, or other documents via wikilinks

### Naming Convention

Both folders use sequential numbering within each date:

| Folder | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `Executive Summaries/2026-01-10/01.md` | First summary of the day |
| `Executive Summaries/2026-01-10/02.md` | Second summary of the day |
| `Transcripts/2026-01-10/01.md` | First transcript of the day |
| `Transcripts/2026-01-10/02.md` | Second transcript of the day |

### Frontmatter

All output files must include YAML frontmatter. Generate a TID for each file:

```bash
node ~/.copilot/skills/frontmatter-add/scripts/generate-tid.js
```

**Executive summary frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
uid: <TID>
type: executive.summary
created: <ISO 8601>
tags: []
links:
  source: [<transcript TID if archived>]
  related: []
---
```

**Transcript archive frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
uid: <TID>
type: transcript
created: <ISO 8601>
tags: []
links:
  related: []
---
```

The `links.source` field in the executive summary connects it to the archived transcript.

### Archive Format

**For GitHub conversations**: Include title, URL, author, state, creation date, body, and all comments with author attribution and timestamps.

**For meeting transcripts**: Preserve the full transcript text with speaker names and timestamps as provided by the source platform.
