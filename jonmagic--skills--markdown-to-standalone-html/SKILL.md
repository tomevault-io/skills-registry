# Markdown → Standalone HTML (Embedded Images)

## Overview

Convert any Markdown file into a **single self-contained HTML document** with all images embedded as base64 data URIs. No external hosting required—the output is a single `.html` file that works offline.

## Requirements

- `pandoc` — Markdown → HTML conversion
- `ruby` — Script execution

Both must be on your `PATH`. The script checks and exits with a clear error if missing.

## Workflow

1. **Prepare your Markdown** — Any `.md` file with images (local paths or public URLs)
2. **Run the conversion script** with the Markdown file, title, and output path
3. **Resolve images** — If images can't be found locally, you'll be prompted for a file path or URL
4. **Get your HTML** — A single `.html` file with all images embedded, ready to share

## Image Resolution

For each image in your Markdown:

1. **Relative path** — Resolved relative to the Markdown file's directory
2. **Absolute path** — Used as-is if it exists
3. **Public URL** (`http://` or `https://`) — Downloaded to temp directory, embedded, then cleaned up
4. **Unresolved** — You're prompted to provide a local file path or URL

All images in the final HTML are base64-encoded and embedded directly—no external dependencies.

## Limitations

- Only rewrites `<img src="">` tags (not CSS `background-image` URLs)
- Does not guess missing images; prompts interactively instead
- Untrusted SVG can contain scripts—review embedded SVG carefully

## Script Reference

**Script:** `scripts/markdown_to_standalone_html.rb`
