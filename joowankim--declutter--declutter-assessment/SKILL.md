# Codebase Assessment

## Purpose

Systematically evaluate a codebase to understand its current state, identify quality issues, and prioritize refactoring opportunities.

## The Assessment Rule

```
NO REFACTORING WITHOUT COMPLETE ASSESSMENT FIRST
```

Rushing into refactoring without understanding the codebase leads to:
- Fixing symptoms instead of root causes
- Missing critical dependencies
- Breaking hidden functionality
- Wasted effort on low-value changes

## Assessment Phases

### Phase 1: Structural Analysis

**Objective:** Understand the codebase architecture.

```markdown
1. Map the directory structure
2. Identify entry points
3. Trace dependencies between modules
4. Document build and test configuration
```

**Output:**
- Architecture diagram
- Module dependency graph
- Build/test commands

### Phase 2: Complexity Hotspots

**Objective:** Find the most problematic areas.

**Metrics to collect:**
| Metric | Tool | Threshold |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Cyclomatic Complexity | radon/escomplex | >10 = high |
| Lines per file | wc -l | >500 = review |
| Lines per function | AST analysis | >50 = extract |
| Nesting depth | AST analysis | >4 = flatten |
| Import count | grep/AST | >15 = god module |

**Output:**
- Ranked list of complexity hotspots
- Visualization of problem areas

### Phase 3: Code Smell Detection

**Objective:** Identify specific quality issues.

Invoke `declutter:smell-detection` skill and document findings:

```markdown
- [ ] Bloaters identified
- [ ] OO Abusers identified
- [ ] Change Preventers identified
- [ ] Dispensables identified
- [ ] Couplers identified
```

**Output:**
- Smell report with severity levels

### Phase 4: Test Coverage Analysis

**Objective:** Understand existing test safety net.

```markdown
1. Run coverage tool (pytest-cov, istanbul, etc.)
2. Identify untested critical paths
3. Map coverage to complexity hotspots
4. Flag high-complexity + low-coverage areas
```

**Output:**
- Coverage report
- Risk matrix (complexity vs coverage)

### Phase 5: Change History Analysis

**Objective:** Find areas that change frequently.

```bash
# Most frequently changed files
git log --pretty=format: --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -rg | head -20

# Files with most authors (potential knowledge gaps)
git log --pretty=format:'%an' --name-only | ...

# Recent churn (files changed in last month)
git log --since="1 month ago" --pretty=format: --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -rg
```

**Output:**
- Change frequency analysis
- Knowledge distribution map

## Prioritized Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Block development)
1. [Issue] - [Location] - [Suggested fix]

### High Priority (Next sprint)
1. [Issue] - [Location] - [Suggested fix]

### Medium Priority (Scheduled refactoring)
1. [Issue] - [Location] - [Suggested fix]

### Low Priority (Opportunistic)
1. [Issue] - [Location] - [Suggested fix]

## Next Steps
1. Review this assessment with the team
2. Approve refactoring priorities
3. Begin with `declutter:planning` for approved items
```
