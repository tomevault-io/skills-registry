# K8s Resource Optimizer

## Purpose and Intent
The `k8s-resource-optimizer` helps teams balance performance and cost. It identifies containers that are either "starving" (causing crashes) or "bloated" (wasting money) by comparing their configuration against actual usage patterns.

## When to Use
- **Cloud Cost Optimization**: Run monthly to identify waste in your clusters.
- **Reliability Engineering**: Use after a production incident involving OOMKills to find the correct memory threshold.
- **Pre-production Scaling**: Set realistic requests/limits before a major launch.

## When NOT to Use
- **Initial Development**: Don't over-optimize before you have real traffic patterns.
- **Real-time Autoscaling**: This tool is for "right-sizing" configuration; use a HPA/VPA for real-time adjustments.

## Security and Data-Handling Considerations
- No live cluster interaction required if metrics are passed as text/json.
- Safe to run on infrastructure-as-code files.
