# Skill Validator

## Purpose and Intent
The `skill-validator` is the primary quality control tool for this repository. It ensures that every AI Agent Skill is "machine-consumable" by validating it against the `agentskills.io` standard and the repository's `AGENTS.md` rules.

## When to Use
- **During Development**: Run this skill every time you create or modify a skill.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automatically block Pull Requests that contain non-compliant skill definitions.
- **Repository Audits**: Periodically scan the entire `agent-skills/` directory to ensure long-term compliance as specifications evolve.

## When NOT to Use
- **Code Logic Validation**: This tool does not "run" the skills or verify their internal logic; it only validates the "contract" (the YAML and Markdown).

## Error Conditions and Edge Cases
- **Invalid YAML**: If `skill.yaml` cannot be parsed, the validator will fail immediately with a syntax error.
- **Missing Required Fields**: Any missing field defined in the `agentskills.io` specification will result in `is_valid: false`.
- **Empty Directories**: Folders in `agent-skills/` that do not contain a `skill.yaml` will be flagged as invalid skills.

## Security and Data-Handling Considerations
- **ReadOnly Access**: The skill only requires read permissions for the target directory.
- **No External Calls**: Validation is performed locally using the embedded schema rules.
