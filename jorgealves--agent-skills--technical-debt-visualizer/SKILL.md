name: technical-debt-visualizer
description: Generates a heat-map and metrics report of a repository based on code complexity, lack of tests, and 'TODO/FIXME' density. Use when you need to identify high-risk areas for refactoring or when planning technical debt reduction sprints.

# Technical Debt Visualizer

## Purpose and Intent
The `technical-debt-visualizer` provides a data-driven view of software quality. It helps engineering leaders and developers prioritize refactoring work by identifying files that are both complex and frequently changed—the "high-interest" technical debt.

## When to Use
- **Sprint Planning**: Run this before a dedicated refactoring sprint to identify the best "ROI" targets.
- **Architectural Reviews**: Use to visualize the impact of legacy systems on the overall codebase health.
- **Due Diligence**: Quickly assess the health of a new or acquired repository.

## When NOT to Use
- **Performance Benchmarking**: This tool measures code *structure* and *maintainability*, not runtime performance.
- **Absolute Complexity Rating**: Metrics like cyclomatic complexity are indicators, not absolute rules; some complex logic is unavoidable.

## Input and Output Examples

### Input
```yaml
source_path: "./src"
output_format: "markdown"
```

### Output
A markdown report highlighting "Hotspots"—files that have high complexity and low test coverage.

## Error Conditions and Edge Cases
- **No Git History**: If run on a non-git directory, the "change frequency" metric will be unavailable.
- **Unsupported Languages**: Complexity analysis is language-dependent; unknown extensions will be reported with a lower confidence score.

## Security and Data-Handling Considerations
- **Local Scan**: The analysis is performed entirely in memory on the local machine.
- **No Execution**: The tool uses static analysis; it never runs the code it is analyzing.
