# Code Analysis

A comprehensive code analysis skill that helps evaluate code quality, identify potential issues, and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Quick Start

Basic code analysis workflow:

```python
# Read the code file
with open("target_file.py", "r") as f:
    code = f.read()

# Run an LLM code review following code-review-instructions/copilot-instructions.md
# Summarize findings by severity with clear, actionable recommendations
```

## LLM Code Review Mode (Preferred)

Use the LLM (no scripts) to perform reviews guided by [`code-review-instructions/copilot-instructions.md`](code-review-instructions/copilot-instructions.md):
- Keep the instructions open; follow the severity model (Blocking, Important, Suggestions) and priority order (Security → Reliability → Performance/Cost → Testing → Observability → Readability).
- Make the review scope explicit (files/diff) and skip excluded assets like generated/vendor/lock files unless instructed otherwise.
- Pull the relevant stack rules and checklists referenced in the instructions; cite them when flagging issues.
- Report findings first with file:line, impact, and the specific fix or test to add before closing with positives.

## Review Checklists and Stack Rules

- **Start with general review lists**: `docs/review/code-conventions.md`, `docs/review/readability-checklist.md`, `docs/review/reliability-checklist.md`, `docs/review/security-checklist.md`, `docs/review/performance-checklist.md`, `docs/review/testing-checklist.md`.
- **Apply stack-specific rules**: `docs/stack-rules/react-typescript-rules.md`, `docs/stack-rules/angular-rules.md`, `docs/stack-rules/python-rules.md`, `docs/stack-rules/java-rules.md`, `docs/stack-rules/java-kotlin-rules.md`, `docs/stack-rules/scala-rules.md`, `docs/stack-rules/go-rules.md`.
- **Report with references**: Link findings to the checklist/rule anchor that was violated for fast remediation.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Code Quality Assessment

Evaluate overall code quality across multiple dimensions:

- **Readability**: Variable naming, function clarity, code organization
- **Maintainability**: Code complexity, coupling, cohesion
- **Performance**: Potential bottlenecks, inefficient patterns
- **Security**: Common vulnerabilities, input validation
- **Best Practices**: Language-specific conventions and idioms

### 2. Code Smell Detection

Identify common code smells:

- **Long Method**: Functions exceeding reasonable length
- **Large Class**: Classes with too many responsibilities
- **Duplicate Code**: Similar code patterns across files
- **Dead Code**: Unused variables, functions, imports
- **Magic Numbers**: Hardcoded values without explanation
- **Deep Nesting**: Excessive indentation levels
- **God Object**: Classes doing too much

### 3. Complexity Metrics

Calculate and interpret:

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Number of independent paths
- **Cognitive Complexity**: How difficult code is to understand
- **Lines of Code**: Total, comment, and blank lines
- **Function/Method Count**: Per class or module
- **Dependency Analysis**: Import structure and coupling

## Workflows

### Workflow 0: LLM Code Review (Copilot Instructions)

1. **Open the instructions**: Keep [`code-review-instructions/copilot-instructions.md`](code-review-instructions/copilot-instructions.md) in view.
2. **Identify scope**: List files/diffs included; skip excluded files noted in the instructions.
3. **Assess critical paths first**: Security → reliability → performance/cost → tests → observability → readability/UX.
4. **Apply stack rules**: Pull the relevant concise or full stack rule docs referenced by the instructions.
5. **Report findings**: Start with blocking/important issues, cite file:line, describe impact, and propose the fix.
6. **Close with next steps**: Tests to add/run and any follow-ups required to de-risk.

### Workflow 1: Comprehensive File Analysis

1. **Read the target file**
2. **Parse code structure**: Functions, classes, imports
3. **Calculate metrics**: Complexity, LOC, depth
4. **Detect issues**: Code smells, anti-patterns
5. **Generate report**: Structured findings with priorities
6. **Provide recommendations**: Specific, actionable improvements

### Workflow 2: Multi-File Project Analysis

1. **Scan project structure**
2. **Identify dependencies**
3. **Analyze each file**: Apply single-file workflow
4. **Cross-reference issues**: Duplicate code, circular dependencies
5. **Aggregate findings**: Project-wide statistics
6. **Prioritize improvements**: Impact vs effort matrix

### Workflow 3: Focused Issue Investigation

1. **Receive specific concern**: Performance, security, readability
2. **Deep dive analysis**: Targeted inspection
3. **Identify root causes**
4. **Suggest solutions**: Multiple options with trade-offs
5. **Provide examples**: Before/after code snippets

## Analysis Output Format

Structure your analysis as follows:

```markdown
## Code Analysis Report

### Summary
- File: [filename]
- Language: [language]
- Lines of Code: [total]
- Overall Quality: [High/Medium/Low]

### Metrics
- Cyclomatic Complexity: [average] (functions: [list high-complexity ones])
- Maintainability Index: [score]
- Code Smells Detected: [count]

### Critical Issues (Priority: High)
1. [Issue description]
   - Location: Line [X]
   - Impact: [explanation]
   - Recommendation: [specific fix]

### Moderate Issues (Priority: Medium)
[Similar structure]

### Minor Improvements (Priority: Low)
[Similar structure]

### Positive Aspects
- [What's done well]
- [Good patterns observed]

### Actionable Recommendations
1. [Priority 1 action]
2. [Priority 2 action]
3. [Priority 3 action]
```

## Best Practices for Analysis

1. **Be Specific**: Point to exact line numbers and code sections
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why something is an issue
3. **Offer Solutions**: Don't just identify problems, suggest fixes
4. **Show Examples**: Include code snippets when helpful
5. **Consider Trade-offs**: Acknowledge when recommendations have costs
6. **Prioritize**: Not all issues are equal importance
7. **Be Constructive**: Focus on improvement, not criticism

## Common Patterns to Check

### Anti-Patterns

```python
# Anti-pattern: God Object
class UserManager:
    def authenticate(self): pass
    def send_email(self): pass
    def generate_report(self): pass
    def process_payment(self): pass
    # Too many responsibilities!

# Better: Single Responsibility
class Authenticator:
    def authenticate(self): pass

class EmailService:
    def send_email(self): pass
```

### Performance Issues

```python
# Inefficient: Multiple iterations
data = [process(x) for x in items]
filtered = [x for x in data if x > 0]
result = [transform(x) for x in filtered]

# Efficient: Single pass
result = [transform(process(x)) for x in items if process(x) > 0]
```

### Security Concerns

```python
# Vulnerable: SQL Injection
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# Safe: Parameterized query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

## Integration with Other Tools

This skill can reference:

- **Linting tools**: pylint, eslint, golangci-lint
- **Testing**: pytest, jest, JUnit results
- **Coverage**: Code coverage reports
- **Profiling**: Performance profiler output

For detailed language-specific guidelines, see [LANGUAGE_GUIDES.md](LANGUAGE_GUIDES.md).

- Prefer LLM-driven review; do not call scripts like `scripts/analyze.py` unless explicitly requested.

## Limitations

- Cannot execute code for dynamic analysis
- Limited to static code analysis
- May miss runtime-only issues
- Context-dependent recommendations require human judgment

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Reviewing pull requests
- Auditing legacy code
- Planning refactoring efforts
- Conducting code quality assessments
- Training team members on best practices
- Investigating specific code issues
- Preparing for production deployment

## Examples

See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for detailed analysis examples across different languages and scenarios.

See [EXAMPLES_STACK.md](EXAMPLES_STACK.md) for comprehensive examples with React, TypeScript, Angular, Python, Java, and Kotlin.
