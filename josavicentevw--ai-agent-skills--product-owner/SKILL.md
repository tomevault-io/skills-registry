# Product Owner

A comprehensive skill designed to assist Product Owners in managing product development, defining requirements, prioritizing features, and communicating with stakeholders.

## Quick Start

Basic Product Owner workflow:

```
# Define product vision
# Gather requirements
# Create user stories
# Prioritize backlog
# Plan sprints
# Communicate with stakeholders
```

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Product Vision & Strategy

Define and communicate product direction:

- **Vision Statement**: Articulate the product's purpose and goals
- **Product Goals**: Set measurable objectives (OKRs, KPIs)
- **Value Proposition**: Define what makes the product valuable
- **Market Analysis**: Understand competitors and market position
- **Roadmap Planning**: Strategic feature planning over time

### 2. Requirements Gathering

Collect and document requirements:

- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Extract needs from users and stakeholders
- **User Research**: Conduct surveys, interviews, usability tests
- **Feature Requests**: Capture and evaluate feature ideas
- **Business Requirements**: Document business needs and constraints
- **Technical Constraints**: Understand technical limitations

### 3. User Story Creation

Write effective user stories:

**User Story Format:**
```
As a [type of user]
I want [goal/desire]
So that [benefit/reason]
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [expected outcome]
```

**INVEST Principles:**
- **I**ndependent: Stories should be self-contained
- **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed
- **V**aluable: Provides value to users
- **E**stimable: Team can estimate effort
- **S**mall: Fits in one sprint
- **T**estable: Clear acceptance criteria

### 4. Backlog Management

Maintain a healthy product backlog:

- **Backlog Grooming**: Regular refinement sessions
- **Prioritization**: Order items by value and urgency
- **Estimation**: Support team in sizing work
- **Dependencies**: Identify and manage dependencies
- **Technical Debt**: Balance features with tech debt

### 5. Sprint Planning

Plan effective sprints:

- **Sprint Goals**: Define clear objectives
- **Capacity Planning**: Match work to team capacity
- **Story Selection**: Choose right stories for sprint
- **Definition of Done**: Ensure shared understanding
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential blockers

### 6. Stakeholder Communication

Keep stakeholders informed:

- **Status Updates**: Regular progress reports
- **Demo Preparation**: Showcase completed work
- **Expectation Management**: Align on timelines
- **Feedback Collection**: Gather stakeholder input
- **Change Communication**: Explain scope or priority changes

## User Story Templates

### Feature Story

```
TITLE: User Login with Email

As a registered user
I want to log in using my email and password
So that I can access my personalized dashboard

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I'm on the login page
  When I enter valid credentials
  Then I should be redirected to my dashboard

- Given I'm on the login page
  When I enter invalid credentials
  Then I should see an error message "Invalid email or password"

- Given I'm logged in
  When I close and reopen the app within 7 days
  Then I should remain logged in

Technical Notes:
- Use JWT tokens for session management
- Implement rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Support OAuth as future enhancement

Dependencies:
- User registration must be completed first

Story Points: 5
Priority: High
Sprint: Sprint 12
```

### Bug Story

```
TITLE: Shopping cart total shows incorrect amount

As a customer
I want the cart total to accurately reflect my items
So that I know exactly how much I'll be charged

Current Behavior:
When adding items to cart, the total sometimes shows $0.00

Expected Behavior:
Total should update immediately and show correct sum

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add item A ($20) to cart
2. Add item B ($15) to cart
3. Observe total shows $0.00 instead of $35.00

Impact: High (blocks purchases)
Frequency: Intermittent (30% of the time)
Browser: Chrome 120, Firefox 115

Story Points: 3
Priority: Critical
Sprint: Sprint 12
```

### Technical Story

```
TITLE: Migrate user database to PostgreSQL

As a development team
We want to migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL
So that we can use advanced features and improve performance

Acceptance Criteria:
- All user data migrated without loss
- Application works with new database
- Rollback plan tested and documented
- Performance benchmarks show improvement

Technical Approach:
1. Set up PostgreSQL instance
2. Create migration scripts
3. Test in staging environment
4. Schedule maintenance window
5. Execute migration
6. Verify data integrity

Dependencies:
- DevOps team availability
- Stakeholder approval for downtime

Story Points: 13
Priority: Medium
Sprint: Sprint 14
```

## Prioritization Frameworks

### 1. MoSCoW Method

```
Must Have: Critical for release
Should Have: Important but not vital
Could Have: Nice to have if time permits
Won't Have: Not in this release
```

### 2. RICE Score

```
RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach: How many users affected (per quarter)
Impact: Scale 0.25 (minimal) to 3 (massive)
Confidence: Percentage (100% = high confidence)
Effort: Person-months of work

Example:
Feature A: (1000 × 2 × 80%) / 2 = 800
Feature B: (500 × 3 × 90%) / 1 = 1350
→ Prioritize Feature B
```

### 3. Value vs Effort Matrix

```
High Value, Low Effort → Do First (Quick Wins)
High Value, High Effort → Plan Carefully (Major Projects)
Low Value, Low Effort → Do Later (Fill-ins)
Low Value, High Effort → Avoid (Money Pits)
```

## Best Practices

### User Story Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Write from user's perspective
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Keep stories small (completable in 1 sprint)
- Focus on value, not implementation
- Use consistent format
- Include testable criteria

❌ **DON'T:**
- Write technical tasks as stories
- Mix multiple features in one story
- Skip acceptance criteria
- Use vague language ("improve", "enhance")
- Forget to estimate
- Create dependencies between stories in same sprint

### Backlog Management Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Groom backlog weekly
- Keep top 2 sprints detailed and estimated
- Archive old/irrelevant stories
- Use labels for categorization
- Document decisions in story comments
- Involve team in estimation

❌ **DON'T:**
- Let backlog grow over 3-4 sprints
- Estimate too far ahead
- Change priorities mid-sprint
- Skip refinement sessions
- Prioritize by who asked loudest

2. Explain sprint commitment
3. Add to backlog with high priority
4. Offer to discuss in next planning
5. Provide timeline estimate

**Template:**
```
"Thanks for the suggestion! I've added this to our backlog 
with high priority. We're currently committed to Sprint X goals,
but we'll evaluate this in our planning session next Tuesday.

Based on initial assessment, this would likely be a 2-3 sprint effort.
Let's schedule 30 minutes to discuss requirements in detail."
```

### Scenario 2: Team Velocity Drops

**Actions:**
1. Review sprint retrospectives for patterns
2. Check for scope creep or unclear stories
3. Identify blockers (tech debt, dependencies, etc.)
4. Adjust capacity planning
5. Focus on removing impediments

### Scenario 3: Conflicting Priorities from Multiple Stakeholders

**Actions:**
1. Document all requests with business value
2. Use RICE or similar framework for objective scoring
3. Present analysis to stakeholders
4. Facilitate decision-making meeting
5. Communicate final decision with rationale
