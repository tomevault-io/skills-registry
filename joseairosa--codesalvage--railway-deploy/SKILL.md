# Railway Production Deployment

## Problem

Deploying to Railway requires coordinating multiple steps: environment variables, database migrations, health checks, and external service configuration (Stripe, SendGrid, GitHub OAuth). Missing any step can cause production failures.

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:
- User asks to "deploy to production" or "deploy to Railway"
- Completing a feature and ready for production release
- Initial production launch setup
- Updating production after bug fixes

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation (30 min)

**Run locally before deploying:**

```bash
# 1. Validate environment variables
npm run validate:env

# 2. Run all tests
npm test
# Expected: ✓ 507 passed

# 3. Lint and type-check
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit

# 4. Build verification
npm run build

# 5. Verify clean working directory
git status
git log -5
```

**Stop if any validation fails. Fix issues before proceeding.**

### Phase 2: Railway Configuration

**Critical environment variables to set in Railway dashboard:**

| Variable | Source | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Auto-set by Railway Postgres | - |
| `REDIS_URL` | Auto-set by Railway Redis | - |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | `openssl rand -base64 32` | - |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe Dashboard (live mode) | `sk_live_...` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Stripe Dashboard | `pk_live_...` |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe webhook config | `whsec_...` |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Generate random | - |
| `HONEYBADGER_API_KEY` | Honeybadger dashboard | - |

**See PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md for full list (30+ variables).**

**External service updates:**
- Stripe: Configure webhook `https://codesalvage.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
- GitHub OAuth: Update callback URL to production domain
- Configure custom domain in Railway → Settings → Domains

### Phase 3: Deploy

```bash
# Auto-deploy on push to main
git push origin main

# OR manual deploy via Railway CLI
railway up

# Monitor deployment
railway logs
```

### Phase 4: Database Migrations

```bash
# CRITICAL: Run after deployment succeeds
railway run npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

### Phase 5: Post-Deployment Verification (15 min)

```bash
# 1. Automated health check
bash scripts/post-deployment-check.sh https://codesalvage.com YOUR_CRON_SECRET

# 2. Detailed health check
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" \
  "https://codesalvage.com/api/health?detailed=true" | jq

# 3. Manual checks
# - Homepage loads: https://codesalvage.com
# - GitHub OAuth login works
# - Browse projects: /projects
# - Health endpoint: /api/health returns 200
```

### Phase 6: Monitoring (First 24-48 Hours)

**Check every 2 hours:**
- Honeybadger (no critical errors)
- Railway metrics (CPU, memory normal)
- Stripe Dashboard (webhooks delivering)
- SendGrid Activity (emails sending)

## Success Criteria

Deployment successful when:
- ✅ All health checks pass
- ✅ No errors in Honeybadger
- ✅ Railway metrics normal
- ✅ Stripe webhooks delivering
- ✅ DNS resolving correctly
- ✅ HTTPS certificate valid

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues found:

```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
# Deployments → Click previous successful deployment → Redeploy
```

Then investigate with `railway logs` and Honeybadger.

## Common Issues

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Database connection errors | Check `DATABASE_URL`, verify Postgres running |
| Redis connection errors | Check `REDIS_URL`, verify Redis running |
| Stripe webhook failures | Verify webhook URL and signing secret in Stripe Dashboard |
| Email not sending | Check SendGrid API key, verify domain authentication |
| GitHub OAuth fails | Verify callback URL: `https://codesalvage.com/api/auth/callback/github` |

## Example

**Typical deployment session:**

```bash
# Local validation
npm run validate:env && npm test && npm run lint && npm run build

# Deploy
git push origin main

# Monitor
railway logs

# Migrate
railway run npm run db:migrate:deploy

# Verify
bash scripts/post-deployment-check.sh https://codesalvage.com $CRON_SECRET

# Success! Monitor Honeybadger and Railway metrics
```
