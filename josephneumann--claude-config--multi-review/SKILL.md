# Multi-Review: Parallel Specialized Code Review

You are orchestrating a comprehensive code review using multiple specialized review agents in parallel.

## Argument Parsing

Check if `--plan <path>` was passed in arguments. If present:
- Set `$PLAN_MODE = true` and `$PLAN_PATH = <path>`
- Verify the plan file exists. If not, error: "Plan file not found: `<path>`"
- In plan mode, you are reviewing an **implementation plan** (not code). The goal is to catch issues that would surface during code review if the plan is implemented as written.

Check if `--codex` was passed. If present: `$CODEX_ENABLED = true`.
Check if `--codex-adversarial` was passed. If present: `$CODEX_ENABLED = true`, `$CODEX_ADVERSARIAL = true`.

If `--plan` is not present: `$PLAN_MODE = false`. Proceed with normal code review mode.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Changes

**If `$PLAN_MODE`:** Read the plan file at `$PLAN_PATH`. The full plan text is the content under review. Skip to Step 2.

**Otherwise (code mode):**

Determine what code to review:

```bash
# If in a PR/branch context
git diff main...HEAD --name-only

# Or for staged changes
git diff --cached --name-only

# Or recent changes
git diff HEAD~5 --name-only
```

List the changed files and their types (e.g., `.py`, `.ts`, `.go`).

### Step 1.5: Load Review Configuration

**If `$PLAN_MODE`:** Skip this step (review config applies to code, not plans).

Check for a project-level review configuration:

```bash
# Prefer review.json, fall back to risk-tiers.json for backward compatibility
cat .claude/review.json 2>/dev/null || cat .claude/risk-tiers.json 2>/dev/null || echo "No review config found"
```

If found, parse the configuration:
- `tiers`: Maps risk levels (critical, high, medium, low) to file glob patterns
- `reviewers` (v2): Optional object with `exclude` and `include` arrays for reviewer control

**Codex config:** If the config contains a `codex` key, parse it:
- `"codex": { "enabled": true }` → set `$CODEX_ENABLED = true` (unless already set by `--codex` flag)
- `"codex": { "adversarial": true }` → set `$CODEX_ADVERSARIAL = true` (unless already set by `--codex-adversarial` flag)
- CLI flags override config values.

**Backward compatibility:** If the config contains a v1 `frameworks` key, honor it as a gate for framework reviewers and log a deprecation note: "Deprecation: `frameworks` array in risk-tiers.json is deprecated. Framework reviewers now auto-detect. Migrate to review.json v2 schema."

**Risk tier resolution:** For each changed file, match against tier patterns (most specific match wins). If a file matches multiple tiers, use the highest tier. If no match, default to `medium`.

Determine the **overall PR risk tier** = the highest tier among all changed files.

If no review config exists, fall back to the keyword-based behavior in Step 2.

### Step 2: Analyze Change Types

**If `$PLAN_MODE`:** Keyword-scan the plan content to determine which reviewers are relevant:

| Plan Content Keywords | Relevant Reviewers |
|---|---|
| auth, permissions, user data, API keys, tokens, secrets | security-sentinel |
| queries, caching, large datasets, real-time, N+1, batch, async | performance-oracle |
| architecture, modules, services, boundaries, interfaces | architecture-strategist |
| migrations, schema, data models, database, tables | data-integrity-guardian |
| API endpoints, routes, rate limiting, CORS | api-security-reviewer |
| UI components, user flows, forms, pages, modals | ux-reviewer |
| user-facing features, actions, agent capabilities | agent-native-reviewer |

Skip to Step 3 after scanning.

**Otherwise (code mode):**

Categorize the changes to select appropriate reviewers:

| Change Type | Indicators | Relevant Reviewers |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| Auth/Security | login, auth, password, token, jwt, permission | security-sentinel |
| Performance | query, cache, loop, batch, async, database | performance-oracle |
| Architecture | new files, interface, refactor, module | architecture-strategist |
| Patterns | any code change | pattern-recognition-specialist |
| Complexity | any code change | code-simplicity-reviewer |
| Agent/Tool systems | agent definitions, skills, prompts, tool configs, UI actions, API endpoints, forms, routes, new entity models, system prompt templates, context injection code | agent-native-reviewer |
| Database migrations | db/migrate/*, schema changes, data backfills | data-integrity-guardian, data-migration-expert |
| UX/Interaction | components, forms, modals, flows, navigation | ux-reviewer |
| Frontend Perf  | images, imports, dependencies, animations     | frontend-performance-reviewer |
| Frontend/UI | .tsx, .jsx, .vue, .svelte, .html, .css, templates | (browser testing — see Step 9) |

### Step 2.5: Framework Auto-Detection

**If `$PLAN_MODE`:** Skip this step (framework detection is file-based, not applicable to plans).

Map changed files to framework reviewers. A framework reviewer is activated when at least one changed file matches its patterns. No config required.

| File Patterns | Framework | Agent |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `next.config.*`, `middleware.ts` | `nextjs` | `nextjs-reviewer` |
| `*.css`, `tailwind.*`, `components/ui/**` | `tailwind` | `tailwind-reviewer` |
| `*.py`, `alembic/**` | `python-backend` | `python-backend-reviewer` |
| `routes/**`, `api/**`, `endpoints/**`, `controllers/**` | `api` | `api-security-reviewer` |
| `**/tools/**`, `**/agents/**`, `**/prompts/**`, `**/skills/**`, `*.tool.*` | `agent-native` | `agent-native-reviewer` |
| `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte`, `components/**`, `pages/**` | `ux` | `ux-reviewer` |
| `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `*.css`, `next.config.*`, `package.json` | `frontend-perf` | `frontend-performance-reviewer` |

**Reviewer overrides (v2 config):**
- `reviewers.exclude`: Suppress auto-detected reviewers (e.g., `["tailwind-reviewer"]` to prevent false positives)
- `reviewers.include`: Force always-on reviewers regardless of changed files (e.g., `["security-sentinel"]`)

**Backward compatibility:** If a v1 config with a `frameworks` key is loaded, use it as a gate — only activate framework reviewers that are both listed in `frameworks` AND matched by changed files (preserves old behavior).

### Step 3: Select Reviewers

**If `$PLAN_MODE`:**

Always include:
- `architecture-strategist` — structural gaps, boundary violations
- `pattern-recognition-specialist` — anti-patterns in proposed approach

Conditionally include based on keyword scan from Step 2. Select 3-7 reviewers total. Skip to Step 4.

**Otherwise (code mode):**

**Always include:**
- `code-simplicity-reviewer` (YAGNI, complexity)
- `pattern-recognition-specialist` (anti-patterns, conventions)

**Conditionally include (keyword-based):**
- `security-sentinel` — if auth, input handling, secrets, or user data
- `performance-oracle` — if database queries, loops, caching, or data operations
- `architecture-strategist` — if structural changes, new modules, or interface changes
- `agent-native-reviewer` — if agent definitions, skill files, system prompts, tool configurations, new UI actions/views, API endpoints, forms, routes, new entity models/schemas, or context injection code (any change that adds user-facing capabilities, new data entities, or modifies agent context)
- `data-integrity-guardian` — if database migrations, schema changes, or data model modifications
- `data-migration-expert` — if data backfills, ID mappings, enum conversions, or column renames

**Tier-based reviewer selection (when review config exists):**

Use the overall PR risk tier from Step 1.5 to adjust reviewer selection:

| Tier | Reviewers |
|------|-----------|
| **critical** | All conditional reviewers that match + ALL matched framework agents |
| **high** | `security-sentinel` + `performance-oracle` + matched framework agents |
| **medium** | `code-simplicity-reviewer` + `pattern-recognition-specialist` + matched framework agents |
| **low** | `code-simplicity-reviewer` + up to 1 matched framework agent |

Always include `code-simplicity-reviewer` and `pattern-recognition-specialist` regardless of tier.

**Select 3-7 reviewers** based on the change types identified.

### Step 3b: Conditional Migration Reviewers

**If `$PLAN_MODE`:** Skip this step (migration reviewers are triggered by file patterns, not plan content). If the plan mentions migrations, `data-integrity-guardian` is already included via Step 2 keyword scan.

**Run migration-specific agents when the PR matches ANY of these criteria:**

- Files matching `db/migrate/*`, `migrations/*`, or `alembic/versions/*`
- Modifications to columns that store IDs, enums, or mappings
- Data backfill scripts or management commands
- Changes to how data is read/written (e.g., FK to string column)
- PR title/body mentions: migration, backfill, data transformation, ID mapping

**What these agents check:**
- `data-integrity-guardian`: Transaction boundaries, reversibility, constraint safety, ACID compliance, regulatory considerations (GDPR/CCPA)
- `data-migration-expert`: Verifies hard-coded mappings match production reality (prevents swapped IDs), checks for orphaned associations, validates dual-write patterns, provides SQL verification queries

### Step 3c: Codex Prerequisites Check

**If `$CODEX_ENABLED` and not `$PLAN_MODE`:**

Verify the codex CLI is available:

```bash
which codex && codex --version
```

If the command fails:
- Log: "Codex CLI not found — skipping codex review. Install: `npm install -g @openai/codex`"
- Set `$CODEX_ENABLED = false`
- Continue with remaining reviewers

**If `$PLAN_MODE`:** Set `$CODEX_ENABLED = false` — `codex review` reviews code diffs, not plan documents.

### Step 4: Read Agent Definitions

For each selected reviewer, read the agent definition:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/agents/review/<agent-name>.md
```

### Step 4.5: SAST Artifact Consumption (Hybrid Verification)

**If `$PLAN_MODE`:** Skip this step (SAST results come from CI on code, not plans).

Before launching reviewers, check if CI/CD SAST results are available:

```bash
# Check for SARIF artifacts from the security-checks workflow
gh run download --name semgrep-sarif --dir /tmp/sarif 2>/dev/null
```

If SARIF results are found, parse them and include in the `security-sentinel` prompt:

> "The following SAST findings were reported by Semgrep. For each finding, verify it in context: **confirm** as a real vulnerability, **dismiss** as a false positive with explanation, or **escalate** with additional context that amplifies the severity. Do not simply repeat SAST output — add the reasoning that automated tools cannot."

Append the SARIF finding summaries (file, rule ID, message) to the security-sentinel agent's prompt. This creates the hybrid approach: deterministic tools catch patterns, the AI agent reasons about whether they are real vulnerabilities in this specific codebase.

If no SARIF artifacts exist (CI hasn't run, or the project doesn't use the security-checks workflow), skip this step silently.

### Step 5: Launch Parallel Reviews

**If `$PLAN_MODE`:** Each reviewer prompt must include: "You are reviewing an implementation PLAN (not code). Identify issues that would surface during code review if this plan is implemented as written. Focus on: missing considerations, architectural risks, security gaps, performance concerns, and design oversights. Return findings as plan-level concerns (section references, missing elements) not code-level issues (line numbers)." Include the full plan text in each prompt.

Use the Task tool to spawn parallel review agents.

**Model selection:** Default to Sonnet for efficiency. When review config exists and the PR risk tier is **critical**, use Opus for `security-sentinel` and `architecture-strategist` (these benefit most from deeper reasoning on critical code). All other reviewers use Sonnet regardless of tier.

```
Launch these agents in parallel:

1. Task: code-simplicity-reviewer
   - Subagent type: general-purpose
   - Model: sonnet
   - Prompt: [agent definition] + [files to review]

2. Task: pattern-recognition-specialist
   - Subagent type: general-purpose
   - Model: sonnet
   - Prompt: [agent definition] + [files to review]

3. Task: security-sentinel (if critical tier)
   - Subagent type: general-purpose
   - Model: opus (critical tier) or sonnet (other tiers)
   - Prompt: [agent definition] + [files to review]

4. Task: [additional selected reviewer]
   ...
```

**Codex reviewer (if `$CODEX_ENABLED`):**

Launch an additional Agent in parallel with the Claude reviewers above:

```
N+1. Agent: codex-reviewer
   - Subagent type: general-purpose
   - Model: sonnet
   - Prompt:
     You are a review output normalizer. Your job:
     1. Run codex to perform a code review via Bash (timeout: 300000ms):
        codex review --base <base-branch> "<review prompt>"
        (use --uncommitted if reviewing staged/unstaged changes with no branch comparison)
     2. Capture the stdout output.
     3. Parse each finding and normalize into this exact format:

        ## Codex Reviewer Findings

        ### Critical Issues
        - [file:line] [CODEX] Issue description - Confidence: X%

        ### Important Issues
        - [file:line] [CODEX] Issue description - Confidence: X%

        ### Suggestions
        - [file:line] [CODEX] Issue description - Confidence: X%

     4. Map codex severity to the standard format:
        - Critical/Blocker/Bug/Security → Critical Issues
        - Warning/Should-fix/Improvement → Important Issues
        - Suggestion/Nit/Style/Nice-to-have → Suggestions
     5. If codex does not provide confidence percentages, assign:
        Critical: 90%, Important: 80%, Suggestions: 70%
     6. If codex does not provide file:line references, use file path only.
     7. Return ONLY the normalized findings.
```

If `$CODEX_ADVERSARIAL`, use this review prompt:
> "Perform an adversarial review. Challenge design decisions, surface hidden assumptions, question tradeoffs, and pressure-test the approach. Don't just find bugs — challenge whether this is the right solution."

Otherwise use a standard review prompt:
> "Review for security vulnerabilities, correctness bugs, performance issues, and code quality. Format findings by severity."

Each agent should return findings in this format:
```markdown
## [Agent Name] Findings

### Critical Issues
- [Issue with file:line] - Confidence: X%

### Important Issues
- [Issue with file:line] - Confidence: X%

### Suggestions
- [Issue with file:line] - Confidence: X%
```

### Step 5.5: Checklist Augmentation

When constructing prompts for review agents in Step 5, append the following checklist categories as additional review guidance. These supplement each agent's core focus area.

**For all agents — check these universal categories:**

*LLM-specific (high priority if PR touches prompts, tools, or AI integrations):*
- 0-indexed lists in prompts (LLMs reliably return 1-indexed)
- Prompt text listing available tools/capabilities that don't match what's actually wired up
- LLM trust boundary: hallucinated values (emails, URLs, names) persisted without format validation
- Structured tool output accepted without type/shape checks before DB writes
- Word/token limits stated in multiple places that could drift

*Race conditions (include for security-sentinel and performance-oracle):*
- TOCTOU: check-then-set without atomic operation
- find-or-create without unique constraint (concurrent duplicates)
- Non-atomic status transitions (concurrent updates skip/double-apply)

*Niche categories (include for pattern-recognition-specialist):*
- Conditional side effects: branch that forgets a side effect on one path
- Type coercion at language boundaries (cross-language type changes, hash input normalization)
- Time window safety: mismatched windows between related features
- Crypto entropy: truncation vs hashing, rand() for security values, non-constant-time comparisons

### Step 6: Aggregate Findings

Combine results from all reviewers, sorted by severity:

```markdown
## Multi-Review Summary

### Reviewers
- [x] reviewer-name
- [x] codex-reviewer (if enabled)
...

### CRITICAL Findings (blocking — require action)
Security, data safety, race conditions, correctness bugs.
| File:Line | Issue | Reviewer | Confidence | Gate |
|-----------|-------|----------|------------|------|
| ... | ... | ... | ...% | CRITICAL |

### IMPORTANT Findings (should fix — non-blocking but significant)
Performance issues, error handling gaps, non-trivial anti-patterns, meaningful code quality issues.
| File:Line | Issue | Reviewer | Confidence | Gate |
|-----------|-------|----------|------------|------|
| ... | ... | ... | ...% | IMPORTANT |

### INFORMATIONAL Findings (surface, don't block)
Style, suggestions, minor improvements, nice-to-haves.
| File:Line | Issue | Reviewer | Confidence | Gate |
|-----------|-------|----------|------------|------|
| ... | ... | ... | ...% | INFO |
```

**Gate classification rules:**
- **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, race conditions, correctness bugs, missing error handling on critical paths, broken functionality
- **IMPORTANT**: Performance issues, error handling gaps on non-critical paths, non-trivial anti-patterns, meaningful code quality issues
- **INFORMATIONAL**: Code style, naming, minor refactoring opportunities, test coverage suggestions, documentation gaps, performance micro-optimizations

Note: Reviewer agents already output in `Critical Issues / Important Issues / Suggestions` format (Step 5 output template). Map these directly: Critical → CRITICAL, Important → IMPORTANT, Suggestions → INFORMATIONAL.

**Resolution Ledger**: Every finding that enters aggregation (post-suppression) must end the review in one of: `fixed[]`, `dropped[]` (with reason), or `deferred[]` (with reason meeting strict criteria). No finding may remain unresolved when the review concludes.

### Step 6.5: Suppressions

When aggregating findings in Step 6, suppress (do not surface) these categories of findings:

- **"X is redundant with Y"** when the redundancy is harmless and aids readability
- **"Add a comment explaining why this threshold/constant was chosen"** — thresholds change during tuning, comments rot
- **"This assertion could be tighter"** when the assertion already covers the behavior
- **Consistency-only changes** (wrapping a value to match how another is guarded)
- **"Regex doesn't handle edge case X"** when the input is constrained and X never occurs in practice
- **Anything already addressed in the diff being reviewed** — agents must read the FULL diff before commenting

These suppressions reduce noise from low-value suggestions that waste review cycles.

### Step 7: Filter Results

Only surface findings with **confidence >= 80%**. Findings below 80% confidence are entered into the resolution ledger as `dropped[reason: "below confidence threshold (N%)"]` — they do not silently vanish.

**Security exception:** All `security-sentinel` and `api-security-reviewer` findings appear in the main severity tables regardless of confidence level — never collapse them into "Low-Confidence Findings." Tag each with a `[SEC]` prefix in the Issue column to distinguish them from other reviewer findings. Security issues at any confidence level warrant human review.

### Step 8: Resolve Findings

**If `$PLAN_MODE`:** Resolution means amending the plan document (via Edit tool on `$PLAN_PATH`), not fixing code. "Auto-fix" = update the plan section. "Verification" = re-read the plan section to confirm the gap exists. Skip code-specific steps (git blame, etc.).

> **Verification discipline** (from `/verify`): Before proposing any fix, read the actual code at the file:line the reviewer flagged. Reviewers hallucinate. Confirm the issue exists, then fix. If it doesn't exist, drop it — don't implement phantom fixes.

This step resolves ALL findings through a 5-phase process. No finding may remain unresolved.

#### Phase 1: Verify and Classify (agent acts alone)

For each CRITICAL and IMPORTANT finding, before presenting anything:

1. Read actual code at file:line (verification discipline — keeps this)
2. False positive or speculative → `dropped[]` with reason
3. Clear fix exists → `auto-fixable` (agent will apply)
4. Genuinely requires human decision → `deferred`

**Strict defer criteria:**

> The bar for `deferred` is HIGH. These are NOT valid reasons to defer:
> - "This is complex" — complexity isn't a reason to punt
> - "This might have side effects" — verify whether it does, then fix or drop
> - "This could be done multiple ways" — pick the approach matching existing codebase patterns
> - "I'm not sure about the intent" — read surrounding code and git blame
> - "This is a style/taste issue" — match existing patterns, or drop
>
> These ARE valid reasons to defer:
> - Fix requires choosing between two valid architectural approaches with real tradeoffs
> - Fix involves a product/business decision (e.g., "should this error be user-visible or silent?")
> - Fix requires production knowledge the agent cannot verify (e.g., "is this table too large for this migration?")

#### Phase 2: Auto-fix with preview (agent acts, does NOT ask permission)

Present the resolution plan, then apply fixes:

```
## Resolution Plan

### Auto-fixing (N findings):
1. [file:line] - [issue] - [fix description]
2. ...

### Dropped (M findings):
3. [file:line] - [issue] - DROPPED: [reason]
4. ...

### Deferred — requires your decision (P findings):
5. [file:line] - [issue] - DEFERRED: [specific decision needed]
6. ...

Applying auto-fixes...
```

The agent applies all auto-fixable changes to the working tree without asking. It does NOT commit — that's the caller's job (finish-task commits, or the user commits manually). The user can review the diff afterward.

#### Phase 3: Mandatory adjudication of deferred items

After auto-fixes are applied, present ALL deferred findings in a SINGLE `AskUserQuestion` (not one question per finding):

```
## N Deferred Findings Require Your Decision

1. **[file:line]** - [issue] — [reviewer]
   Decision needed: [specific question, e.g., "extract to service vs inline guard?"]
   Options: (a) approach A, (b) approach B, (c) dismiss, (d) create task

2. **[file:line]** - [issue] — [reviewer]
   Decision needed: [specific question]
   Options: (a) approach A, (b) approach B, (c) dismiss, (d) create task

Reply with your choices (e.g., "1a, 2c"):
```

Each response moves the finding to `fixed[]` (agent implements chosen approach), `dropped[]` (dismissed), or `deferred[task: <id>]` (task created for follow-up). The review does NOT proceed to re-review until all deferred items are resolved.

**Autonomous context** (when multi-review runs inside `/finish-task` as a dispatched worker with no human available): skip `AskUserQuestion`. Do NOT create Linear issues. Instead, log all deferred items in the session summary's DISCOVERED WORK section for orchestrator review during reconciliation. Use the structured format (Problem/Approach/Acceptance Criteria/Priority/Label/Target Files). Detection: if the session is a dispatched worker (running in a worktree), treat as autonomous.

#### Phase 4: INFORMATIONAL batch resolution

Present INFORMATIONAL findings as a batch:

```
## Informational Findings (N items)

1. [file:line] - [issue]
2. [file:line] - [issue]
...

Options:
1. Fix all informational items
2. Fix specific items (provide numbers)
3. Acknowledge all (mark as reviewed, no action)
```

User must pick one. "Acknowledge all" is fine — the point is explicit accounting, not forced action. All items move to `fixed[]` or `dropped[acknowledged]`.

**Autonomous context**: auto-fix INFORMATIONAL items that have clear fixes, drop the rest as `dropped[informational — auto-acknowledged]`.

#### Phase 5: Re-review cycles (refined)

After fixes are applied, re-review modified files with escalating thresholds:

- Previous-cycle ledger entries are DONE — never re-evaluated
- Escalating thresholds apply only to NET-NEW findings from re-review of modified files:
  - **Cycle 2**: Re-run only affected reviewers on fix-modified files. Net-new findings >= 85% confidence only.
  - **Cycle 3**: Only Critical findings >= 90% confidence on fix-modified files.
- New findings from Cycle 2/3 enter the ledger and go through the same Verify → Classify → Fix → Adjudicate flow
- The ledger accumulates across cycles

**Exit conditions** (stop the loop when ANY is met):
- **Clean**: Zero findings this iteration → EXIT
- **Diminishing returns**: <3 net-new findings AND zero Critical → EXIT
- **Plateau**: Net-new count >= previous iteration (not converging) → EXIT
- **Limit**: 3 iterations → EXIT

Log exit reason so the final report explains why the loop stopped.

#### Final Report

After all phases complete, output the resolution ledger summary:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
MULTI-REVIEW COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════
Reviewers: [list]
Cycles: N (exit reason: [reason])
Findings: X | Fixed: Y | Dropped: Z | Deferred: W

FIXED:
- [file:line] issue — fix applied

DROPPED:
- [file:line] issue — [reason]

DEFERRED (tasks created):
- [file:line] issue — task <id>

INFORMATIONAL (acknowledged):
- [file:line] issue
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Step 9: Browser Workflow Testing

**If `$PLAN_MODE`:** Skip this step entirely. Browser testing applies to running code, not plans.

**When the PR includes frontend/UI changes**, run workflow-based browser testing.

Detect frontend changes by checking for files matching:
- `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte`, `*.html`
- `*.css`, `*.scss`, `*.less`
- `templates/**`, `views/**`, `components/**`, `pages/**`

If no frontend changes detected, skip this step.

**Read `docs/browser-testing-protocol.md` and follow Phases 1-6:**

1. Pre-flight checks — verify Playwright MCP available, dev server running (Phase 1)
2. Infer workflows from diff — classify changed files, propose to user via `AskUserQuestion` for confirmation (Phase 2)
3. Navigate → clear cache/storage → reload — ensures fresh state, not stale cache (Phase 3)
4. Handle auth if page redirects to login (Phase 4)
5. Execute workflow-type checklists — interact, verify outcomes, verify persistence via reload (Phase 5)
6. Responsive check at desktop (1280x800) + mobile (375x812) and report findings (Phase 6)

**Multi-review specific:** Browser findings enter the same aggregation pipeline as code review findings (Step 6). Classify as Critical/Important/Minor per the protocol's Phase 6 severity table.

### External Reviewers (Optional, CLI-based)

#### codex-reviewer
**Focus**: Second-opinion code review via OpenAI Codex CLI. Provides a review from a different AI model.
**Requires**: `codex` CLI installed (`npm install -g @openai/codex`), OpenAI authentication (`codex login`)
**Enable**: `--codex` flag or `"codex": { "enabled": true }` in review.json
**Adversarial mode**: `--codex-adversarial` flag or `"codex": { "adversarial": true }` in review.json
**Note**: This reviewer runs the codex CLI via Bash, not a Claude agent definition. Output is normalized to the standard findings format by a wrapper agent. Skipped in plan mode.

## Important Notes

- Parallel execution is key — don't run reviewers sequentially
- Filter to >= 80% confidence to reduce noise
- Security findings should always be surfaced even at lower confidence
- Maximum 3 review cycles for auto-fix iterations
- Migration reviewers should always run together (integrity + migration expert)
- Browser testing uses workflow-based verification (not just screenshots) and requires user consent
- Framework reviewers auto-detect from changed files. Use `reviewers.exclude` in `review.json` to suppress false positives.
