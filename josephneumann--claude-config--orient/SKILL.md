# Project Orientation

You are an orchestrating agent orienting to this project. Your goal is to build comprehensive context and identify parallelizable work streams.

**IMPORTANT**: Use extended thinking (ultrathink) throughout this process. Take your time to deeply analyze the project state.

## Phase 1: Project Discovery

### 1.1 Identify Project Root and Type

```bash
pwd
ls -la
git remote -v 2>/dev/null || echo "Not a git repo"
```

Determine:
- Project name
- Primary language/framework
- Monorepo vs single project

### 1.2 Read Core Documentation

Read these files IN ORDER (skip if not found):

1. **CLAUDE.md** - AI assistant guidelines (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
2. **AGENTS.md** - Multi-agent workflow documentation
3. **PROJECT_SPEC.md** - Project specification and requirements
4. **README.md** - Project overview and setup

For each file found, extract:
- Project purpose and goals
- Key architectural decisions
- Development workflow and commands
- Patterns and conventions to follow

### 1.3 Understand Project Structure

```bash
# Get directory structure (2 levels deep)
find . -type d -maxdepth 2 -not -path '*/\.*' -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './.venv/*' -not -path './venv/*' | head -50

# Identify key source directories
ls -la src/ app/ lib/ moneyprinter/ fastapi_backend/ nextjs-frontend/ 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

Map out:
- Source code locations
- Test locations
- Configuration files
- Build/deployment setup

## Phase 1.5: Deep Research (Parallel)

When the project has significant complexity or unfamiliar patterns, run these research agents in parallel using the Task tool to build deeper context:

### Research Agents

1. **repo-research-analyst**
   - Read agent definition: `~/.claude/agents/research/repo-research-analyst.md`
   - Input: Project root path, file structure from Phase 1
   - Output: Convention guide, architecture map, code style patterns
   - Use when: New to the codebase, unfamiliar framework, or complex architecture

2. **git-history-analyzer**
   - Read agent definition: `~/.claude/agents/research/git-history-analyzer.md`
   - Input: Git repository path
   - Output: Contributor expertise areas, decision patterns, hot spots
   - Use when: Need to understand who knows what, or why decisions were made

### Launch Pattern

```
Use Task tool with subagent_type=general-purpose to run research agents in parallel:

Task 1: repo-research-analyst
- Read ~/.claude/agents/research/repo-research-analyst.md
- Analyze project structure and conventions
- Return: architecture summary, conventions guide

Task 2: git-history-analyzer
- Read ~/.claude/agents/research/git-history-analyzer.md
- Analyze git history for patterns
- Return: contributor map, decision patterns
```

### Incorporate Findings

Add research findings to the "CONTEXT FOR NEW SESSIONS" section of the orientation report:
- Key conventions discovered
- Architecture patterns identified
- Expert contributors for different areas
- Historical decisions that inform current work

### Skip Research If

- Already familiar with the codebase
- Small/simple project with clear structure
- Time-sensitive orientation (defer to later)

---

## Phase 1.7: Investigation Recommendation (Optional)

When the project state suggests ambiguity — multiple possible root causes, unclear architecture, or conflicting evidence — consider recommending an investigative dispatch before implementation.

**Indicators:**
- Tests failing with unclear cause
- Recent reverts or fix-on-fix commits in git log
- Task descriptions reference "investigate", "debug", "figure out"
- Stale branches from abandoned parallel work

**If investigation is warranted** and Linear MCP is available, create investigation tasks with quality gate:

```
save_issue(
  title="Investigate: <hypothesis description>",
  team=<team>,
  project=<project>,
  priority=1,
  labels=["Bug"],
  description="## Problem\n<what evidence suggests this hypothesis>\n\n## Approach\n<specific investigation steps>\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Hypothesis confirmed or ruled out\n- [ ] Fix applied or follow-up task created\n\n## Target Files\n- <files to investigate>"
)
```

After creation, run post-write validation: `get_issue(id=<created-id>)` — check for formatting artifacts (literal `\n`, XML tags, trailing `")`) and rewrite if needed.

Then recommend in Phase 5:

"Investigation recommended before implementation dispatch.
Run `/dispatch --plan-first <task-A> <task-B>` to spawn investigators
who will plan their approach before diving in."

**Skip if:** Task board is clear, all ready tasks are straightforward, or user wants to proceed directly.

---

## Phase 2: Task State Analysis

### 2.1 Task Tracker Detection

Check if Linear MCP is available by attempting to call `list_teams`. If available, use Linear for all task state analysis. If not, skip to Phase 3 — report on git state and plan files only.

### 2.2 Recently Completed Work

```bash
# Recent git activity
git log --oneline -15
```

If Linear MCP is available, call `list_issues(state=Done, limit=10, orderBy=updatedAt)` to see recently closed tasks.

Understand:
- What was just completed
- Patterns in recent work
- Momentum and direction

### 2.3 Project Landscape

Gather project-level data. This is the primary strategic view.

If Linear MCP is available:
- Call `list_projects(team=<team>)` to get all projects
- For each project, call `list_issues(project=<project>)` to get issue counts by status
- Compute completion percentage: Done count / total count

Classify projects into two tiers based on priority:
- **FOCUS** (Urgent/High): Projects to actively progress this session
- **DEFERRED** (Normal/Low): Projects acknowledged but not for now

**If no projects exist**, skip sections 2.4-2.5. Instead query all ready tasks directly, then proceed to Phase 3.

### 2.4 Primary Project Drill-Down

Pick the single highest-priority FOCUS project that has ready tasks. Drill into it:

If Linear MCP is available:
- Call `list_issues(project=<project>)` to get all issues in this project
- For each issue, call `get_issue(id, includeRelations=true)` to get dependency data
- Build the dependency graph from `blocks`/`blockedBy` relations
- Identify ready tasks (state=Todo + empty blockedBy)

From the output, identify:
- Critical path tasks (block the most downstream work)
- Independent tasks (can run in parallel)
- What each blocked task is waiting on
- What is already In Progress and who is assigned

**If no project has ready tasks**, note that all focus projects are blocked and show what they're waiting on.

### 2.5 Standalone Tasks

Identify ready tasks not belonging to any project:

If Linear MCP is available, call `list_issues(state=Todo)` and filter to those with no `project` field. These should still appear in dispatch recommendations.

### 2.6 Task Board Health Check

**File-Conflict Risk**: For each pair of ready tasks, read their descriptions. If both mention the same file paths and have no dependency between them, flag a conflict risk.

Report format:
```
FILE CONFLICT RISK: <task-A> and <task-B> both target <file>
  No dependency between them — parallel dispatch may cause merge conflicts.
  Fix: save_issue(id=<lower-priority-task>, blockedBy=[<higher-priority-task>])
```

If no tasks document target files: "Target files not documented in issue descriptions — cannot detect file conflicts."

## Phase 3: Codebase Health Check

### 3.1 Test Status

```bash
# Quick test run to verify health
uv run pytest --tb=no -q 2>&1 | tail -10  # Python
pnpm test 2>&1 | tail -10                  # Node
```

### 3.2 Git State

```bash
git status
git branch -a | head -20
git worktree list
git stash list
```

Check for:
- Uncommitted changes
- Active worktrees/branches (parallel work in progress)
- Stashed work that needs attention

## Phase 4: Synthesis & Recommendations

After gathering all information, provide a structured orientation report. The report is organized as a **layered drill-down**: strategic overview → focused project → actionable tasks.

END ORIENTATION REPORT

```

### Report Edge Cases

Handle these gracefully:

- **No projects exist**: Skip the PROJECT LANDSCAPE and PRIMARY PROJECT sections. Show a flat task overview instead, then proceed directly to DISPATCH RECOMMENDATION.
- **No dependencies defined**: Show the DEPENDENCY MAP section but write "No cross-project dependencies defined."
- **No ready tasks in primary project**: Show the PRIMARY PROJECT section with only IN PROGRESS and BLOCKED TASKS. Note what needs to complete before work can proceed.
- **No task tracker**: Show only git state, plan files, and code health. Skip all task board sections.

## Phase 4.5: Task Visualization

If Linear MCP is available and tasks exist, note: "View your task board in Linear's UI for interactive dependency visualization."

Skip if no task tracker is configured.

## Phase 5: Ready for Action

After presenting the orientation report, **ALWAYS offer `/dispatch` as the primary action when there are 2+ ready tasks.**

Present the following call-to-action:

---

"Orientation complete. **Recommended next step:**

```
/dispatch
```

This will spawn parallel Claude Code workers for the ready tasks. Each worker will:
1. Auto-receive their task assignment via the handoff queue
2. Create a task-specific branch for isolation
3. Run `/start-task <task-id>` automatically
4. Work autonomously until completion

You stay in THIS session as the orchestrator to coordinate as workers complete.

---

**Alternative options:**

1. **Dispatch workers** - Run `/dispatch` to spawn parallel workers (RECOMMENDED)
2. **Manual parallel** - Open separate terminals and run `/start-task <id>` in each
3. **Work solo** - Pick one task with `/start-task <id>` in this session
4. **Deep dive** - Explore a specific task or area in more detail
5. **Coordinate** - Help manage existing parallel work as tasks complete

What would you like to do?"

---

**CRITICAL**: You MUST present `/dispatch` prominently. Do not bury it in a list of options. The whole point of orientation is to enable parallel execution via dispatch.

Await user direction before taking action.
