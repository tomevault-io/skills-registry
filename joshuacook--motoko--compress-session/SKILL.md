# Compress Session

Compress active session into structured summary. Capture decisions, tools built, breakthroughs - the "why" and "how" that git commits don't preserve.

## When to Activate

- User says: "compress", "compress session"
- After significant milestones
- Every ~10 messages in long sessions
- Before ending major work

## Process

### 1. Determine Sequence Number

```bash
ls -t inbox/session-summaries/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

- If files exist: increment (seq2, seq3...)
- If none: this is seq1

### 2. Review Conversation

Identify signal vs. noise:
- **INCLUDE:** Decisions, tools built, breakthroughs, key quotes, context
- **SKIP:** Pleasantries, process discussion without outcome, redundant info

### 3. Write Summary

Create: `inbox/session-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-seqN.md`

```markdown
# Session Capture: YYYY-MM-DD [Sequence N]

**Time:** [Start] - [Current]
**Roles Active:** [List or "general"]
**Messages:** [Approximate range]
**Branch:** [git branch]

---

## Context

[1-3 sentence narrative of what happened this sequence]

---

## Decisions Made

- [Decision 1]
  - Reason: [Why]
- [Decision 2]

---

## Tools/Workflows Built

- **[Name]:** [Description and purpose]

[Or: None this sequence]

---

## Breakthroughs/Insights

- [Insight] - [Significance]

---

## Key Quotes

- "[Quote]" ([Context])

---

## Files Created/Modified

[From git status]
- New: [files]
- Modified: [files]

---

## Next Steps

- [What's coming]

---

**Session compressed. Sequence [N] captured.**
```

### 4. Confirm

```
Session compressed. Sequence [N] captured.
Stored: inbox/session-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-seqN.md
```

## What to Include

- Decisions affecting work/strategy/direction
- Tools/workflows built or planned
- Breakthroughs (creative, technical, conceptual)
- Context explaining *why* decisions were made
- Key quotes revealing intent

## What to Skip

- Conversational filler
- Detailed implementation (git shows that)
- Process discussion without decision
- Speculation that didn't become action

## Tone

- Concise, structured
- Bullet points over paragraphs
- Searchable and scannable
- Neutral observation
