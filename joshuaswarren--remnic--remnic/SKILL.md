description: Shared memory workflow for Claude Code agents connected to Remnic — recall before acting, observe during work, remember at the end. Trigger phrases include "what do you remember about", "save this for later", "any context from last time". Use when this capability is needed.

## When to use

Use this skill as the default playbook whenever Claude Code picks up a task that could benefit from prior context, or when the user explicitly asks the agent to remember or recall something. The individual `remnic-recall`, `remnic-remember`, `remnic-search`, `remnic-entities`, and `remnic-status` skills implement the detailed steps.

Triggers:

- New ticket, branch, or task begins.
- "What do you remember about …"
- "Save this for later."
- Long-running turn produces a durable outcome worth capturing.

## Inputs

- Current user request (natural language).
- Optional: active project path, ticket number, branch name.
- Optional: topic keywords surfaced earlier in the session.

## Procedure

1. **Recall first.** Call `remnic_recall` with a concise natural-language query built from the user's request. Pull 3–8 results and filter for relevance.
2. **Mention relevant memories briefly** to the user when they change the plan; otherwise use them as quiet context.
3. **Observe during work.** For significant tool results (Write/Edit/MultiEdit, Bash exits, test output) call `remnic_observe` so Remnic keeps its ambient context fresh.
4. **Deep search on demand.** If `remnic_recall` missed something the user insists exists, fall back to `remnic_lcm_search` with a more literal phrase.
5. **Browse entities.** When the user names a project, person, or concept, call `remnic_entity_get` to pull facts and relations.
6. **Remember at the end.** Before ending the turn, store durable decisions, preferences, and findings via `remnic_memory_store`.

## Efficiency plan

- One broad recall beats several narrow ones.
- Skip recall for trivially local tasks (formatting, arithmetic, mechanical refactors).
- Reuse recall results within the same turn.
- Store each memory once; update rather than duplicate.

## Pitfalls and fixes

- **Pitfall:** Storing transient state. **Fix:** Only store facts with durable value.
- **Pitfall:** Leaking secrets. **Fix:** Redact credentials and tokens before calling `remnic_memory_store`.
- **Pitfall:** Flooding the user with recalled context. **Fix:** Summarize in 1–3 bullet points.
- **Pitfall:** Forgetting the final write. **Fix:** Make "remember the decision" the last step of any non-trivial turn.

## Verification checklist

- [ ] Recall was attempted before the agent committed to a plan.
- [ ] User-facing mentions of recalled context were concise and relevant.
- [ ] Durable decisions and findings were stored via `remnic_memory_store`.
- [ ] No secrets, credentials, or transient state were written.
- [ ] Canonical `remnic_*` tool names were used over legacy aliases.

> Tool names: this skill uses the canonical `remnic_*` MCP tools. Legacy `engram_*` aliases remain accepted during v1.x for backward compatibility.
