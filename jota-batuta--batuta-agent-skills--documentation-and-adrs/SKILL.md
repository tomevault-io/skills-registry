# Documentation and ADRs

## Per-Slice Mandate

Update PRD, SPEC, and/or ADR **in the same commit** as the code change. Not after the PR merges, not in a follow-up -- in the same commit.

## ADR Status Lifecycle

`PROPOSED` -> `ACCEPTED` -> `SUPERSEDED` | `DEPRECATED`

Don't delete old ADRs. When a decision changes, write a new ADR that references and supersedes the old one.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The code is the documentation" | Code describes what was built; PRD/SPEC/ADR describes why, what was decided, and what was rejected. Code does not replace decisions. |
| "I'll update the docs after the PR is merged" | After merge, no one remembers the trade-offs. The docs update must happen in the same slice commit. |
| "The SPEC is a draft, I'll formalize it when the feature is done" | The SPEC is the contract. If not updated as you implement, it drifts from code and becomes misleading for the next session. |
