# Scan

Automatically discovers and installs Claude skills from SkillsMP.com, official sources, and third-party marketplaces based on project context.

## When to Use

This skill is invoked when:
- `/auto-skills` command is run

## Skill Sources

### 1. SkillsMP.com

Uses AI semantic search to find relevant skills.

**API**: `GET https://skillsmp.com/api/v1/skills/ai-search`

**Queries based on context**:

| Detected Tech | AI Search Query |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Go | `best practices for Go development performance and testing` |
| GraphQL | `GraphQL schema design and resolver patterns` |
| Next.js | `Next.js server components and performance optimization` |
| Playwright | `Playwright testing best practices and page objects` |
| React | `React component patterns and state management` |
| TypeScript | `TypeScript type safety and utility patterns` |
| Database | `database modeling and query optimization` |

### 2. Official Anthropic Skills

**Source**: `https://github.com/anthropics/skills`

### 3. Compound Engineering (Every Marketplace)

Already installed via `compound-engineering@every-marketplace`

## Installation Process

1. **Check `SKILL_INSTALL_LOCATION` env var** for target location
   - `workspace` → install to `~/.claude/skills/` (default)
   - `project` → install to `.claude/skills/`
2. **Search SkillsMP** using AI semantic queries
3. **Review top 3 results** per technology detected
4. **Check for duplicates** - skip if already installed
5. **Install to configured location**
6. **Log installations** for transparency

## Commands Used

```bash
# Determine installation location
SKILL_DIR="${SKILL_INSTALL_LOCATION:-workspace}"
if [ "$SKILL_DIR" = "workspace" ]; then
  TARGET="$HOME/.claude/skills"
else
  TARGET=".claude/skills"
fi

# Check for existing skills in BOTH locations
get_installed_skills() {
  # Check workspace skills
  if [ -d "$HOME/.claude/skills" ]; then
    for dir in "$HOME/.claude/skills"/*; do
      if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
        basename "$dir"
      fi
    done
  fi

  # Check project skills
  if [ -d ".claude/skills" ]; then
    for dir in ".claude/skills"/*; do
      if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
        basename "$dir"
      fi
    done
  fi
}

INSTALLED_SKILLS=$(get_installed_skills)

# Search SkillsMP API
curl -X GET "https://skillsmp.com/api/v1/skills/ai-search?q=<encoded_query>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SKILLSMP_API_KEY"

# Check if skill already exists before installing
skill_name="example-skill"
if echo "$INSTALLED_SKILLS" | grep -qx "$skill_name"; then
  echo "✓ $skill_name already installed, skipping"
else
  mkdir -p "$TARGET"
  git clone <repo_url> "$TARGET/$skill_name"
fi
```

## Example Workflow

Given project context:
```json
{
  "languages": ["go"],
  "frameworks": ["graphql"]
}
```

Actions:
1. Search SkillsMP: `Go development best practices performance testing`
2. Search SkillsMP: `GraphQL schema design resolver patterns`
3. Review top 3 results from each search
4. Filter out already installed skills
5. Install up to 5 most relevant skills
6. Report what was installed

## Skill Selection Criteria

When reviewing search results, prioritize skills with:
- **High star count** on GitHub (community approval)
- **Recent updates** (actively maintained)
- **Clear descriptions** matching the use case
- **Relevant tags** to detected technologies
- **Good documentation** (README, examples)

## Safety Rules

- **Max 5 new skills per auto-skills run** (avoid bloat)
- **Never overwrite existing skills**
- **Always report what was installed and why**
- **Skip if `SKILLSMP_API_KEY` is not set**
- **Validate skill structure** before installing (must have SKILL.md)
- **Check for malware** in skill code before installing

## Transparency

After installing, always output:

```markdown
## Auto Skills Complete

Skills installed to: ~/.claude/skills/ (workspace)

Installed 3 new skills:

1. **go-performance** (⭐ 234)
   - Go performance optimization patterns
   - Source: github.com/user/go-performance

3. **testing-patterns** (⭐ 89)
