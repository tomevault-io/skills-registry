# Skill Architect

## Purpose

Meta-orchestrator for the complete Claude Code skill lifecycle. Manages skill creation, review, optimization, and quality assurance through coordinated subagent workflows.

## When to Use

- User asks to "manage skills" or "oversee skill development"
- Complete skill lifecycle management
- Quality assurance for skill libraries
- Team skill development workflows
- Comprehensive skill audits

## Available Subagents

This orchestrator coordinates three specialized skills:

1. **@skill-generator** - Creates new skills from descriptions
2. **@skill-reviewer** - Reviews skills for quality and best practices
3. **@skill-optimizer** - Refactors skills using PDA

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create and Review

**Use when:** Creating a new skill with quality assurance

```
1. @skill-generator
   - Generate SKILL.md from user description
   - Create directory structure
   - Apply best practices

2. @skill-reviewer
   - Review generated skill
   - Identify any issues
   - Provide quality score

3. Report and Iterate (if needed)
   - Present skill to user
   - Address review feedback
   - Finalize skill
```

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Create a skill for X and review it"
- "Generate and check a new skill"
- "Make a skill for X with quality check"

### Workflow 2: Audit and Optimize

**Use when:** Improving existing skills

```
1. @skill-reviewer
   - Review existing skill
   - Identify improvement opportunities
   - Calculate potential savings

2. @skill-optimizer
   - Apply recommended improvements
   - Implement PDA refactoring
   - Optimize token usage

3. Validation
   - Compare before/after
   - Verify functionality preserved
   - Report improvements
```

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Audit this skill and optimize it"
- "Review and improve this skill"
- "Check and fix this skill"

### Workflow 3: Complete Lifecycle

**Use when:** End-to-end skill development

```
1. Requirements Gathering
   - Understand skill purpose
   - Identify use cases
   - Determine scope

2. @skill-generator
   - Create initial skill
   - Structure content
   - Add examples

3. @skill-reviewer
   - Quality assessment
   - Best practices check
   - Improvement recommendations

4. @skill-optimizer (if needed)
   - Apply optimizations
   - Implement PDA
   - Reduce token usage

5. Final Review
   - Validate improvements
   - Confirm quality standards
   - Deliver production-ready skill
```

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Create a production-ready skill for X"
- "Develop a complete skill from scratch"
- "Build and validate a skill"

### Workflow 4: Skill Library Audit

**Use when:** Reviewing multiple skills

```
1. Discover Skills
   - Find all skills in .claude/skills/
   - List each skill with metadata

2. @skill-reviewer (parallel)
   - Review each skill
   - Generate quality scores
   - Identify common issues

3. Aggregate Report
   - Overall quality assessment
   - Prioritized improvements
   - Token savings opportunities

4. Recommendations
   - Which skills need optimization
   - Which skills are excellent
   - Best practices to share
```

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Audit all my skills"
- "Review my skill library"
- "Check all skills for quality"

**User:** "Create a production-ready skill for processing JSON files with validation and transformation"

**Workflow:**
```
1. @skill-generator
   Creates: json-processor/
   ├── SKILL.md (4KB orchestrator)
   ├── reference/
   │   ├── json-schema.md
   │   ├── transformations.md
   │   └── validation.md
   └── scripts/
       ├── validate.py

**Workflow:**
```
1. @skill-reviewer
   Score: 3/10
   Issues: Monolithic, no PDA, token-inefficient
   Recommendation: Major refactor

2. @skill-optimizer
