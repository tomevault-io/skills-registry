# LinkedIn Stats Extractor

Extracts statistics from LinkedIn recent activity page and displays them in a table format.

**IMPORTANT**:
- This skill uses a bash shell script (`linkedin_stats.sh`), not a TypeScript file
- When running this skill, only display the markdown table output from the script
- Do NOT add any summary, analysis, or commentary about the results
- The output MUST be a properly formatted markdown table with adequate cell padding
- Simply run: `./linkedin_stats.sh <username>` (or just `./linkedin_stats.sh` for default)

## Usage

Simply invoke the skill and provide your LinkedIn profile username:

```
/linkedin-stats jovezhong
```

Or use the default (configured for Jove Zhong):

```
/linkedin-stats
```

## What it does

1. Connects to Arc browser via CDP on port 9222
2. Navigates to your LinkedIn recent activity page
3. Extracts post data including:
   - Post date (exact dates for hours/days, relative format like "1w ago" for weeks/months)
   - First few words of post content
   - Impression count
   - Reaction count (likes/emojis)
   - Comment count
   - Repost count
4. Displays the most recent 10 posts in a markdown table

## Requirements

- Arc browser must be running with remote debugging enabled on port 9222
- The LinkedIn page must be accessible (user must be logged in)
- `agent-browser` command must be available

## Example Output

The output is a properly formatted markdown table with adequate cell padding:

```
| # | Date       | Content                                      | Impressions | Reactions | Comments | Reposts |
|---|------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | 2026-01-17 | Some of my recent posts about #Claude...     | 2,018       | 27        | 3        | 0       |
| 2 | 2026-01-16 | Langfuse joins ClickHouse! "You can check... | 6,534       | 58        | 7        | 1       |
| 3 | 2026-01-16 | 🎉 Cresta hit 50k followers on LinkedIn...   | 482         | 5         | 0        | 0       |
| 4 | 1w ago     | You probably saw the recent drama: Claud...  | 42,319      | 35        | 11       | 1       |
```

**Important**: Only display the table portion, not the progress messages or completion status.

## Technical Details

- **Implementation**: Bash shell script (`linkedin_stats.sh`) that orchestrates the extraction
- **Extraction**: Python script (`scripts/extract_linkedin_posts.py`) processes the snapshot
- **Output format**: Markdown table with properly padded cells for visual alignment
- Uses text-based extraction (not screenshots) to minimize token usage
- Date handling:
  - Exact dates for recent posts: "9 hours ago" → 2026-01-17, "1 day ago" → 2026-01-16
  - Relative format for older posts: "1 week ago" → "1w ago", "2 months ago" → "2mo ago"
  - This approach avoids incorrect date assumptions for posts older than a week
- Handles LinkedIn's lazy loading by scrolling through the page multiple times
- Extracts data from accessibility tree snapshot (agent-browser snapshot -c)
- Captures reaction counts (likes/emoji reactions) in addition to comments and reposts
- Content field is left-justified with padding to ensure table alignment

## Notes

- LinkedIn may not load all posts due to lazy loading (posts 6-8 are sometimes skipped)
- Impression counts update in real-time
- Works best with the "All activity" → "Posts" filter selected
