# CodeCompanion Memory Skill

This skill provides access to a searchable history of previous conversations stored in a ChromaDB vector database. It supports both **retrieving** past conversations via semantic search and **saving** new conversation summaries.

The same database is shared between:
- **Neovim** (via codecompanion-history.nvim plugin)
- **OpenCode** (via this skill and the `/sum` command)

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:

- **User references past conversations**: Phrases like "we discussed this before", "remember when", "last time we talked about"
- **Recurring problems**: The user encounters an issue that might have been solved previously
- **Context would be helpful**: Previous solutions, decisions, or architectural discussions could inform the current task
- **User asks about their codebase**: Questions about past work, project history, or previous implementations
- **Building on previous work**: Extending or modifying solutions from past conversations

## Querying Memories

```bash
~/.config/opencode/skills/codecompanion-memory/query.sh --query "your search query"
```

### Query Parameters

- `--query TEXT` or `-q TEXT`: The search query (required)
  - Use natural language
  - Be specific but not too narrow
  - Examples: "fixing Docker networking", "Go error handling patterns", "setting up ChromaDB"

- `--count NUMBER` or `-n NUMBER`: Number of results to return (default: 5)
  - More results = more context but also more noise
  - Recommended: 3-5 for focused queries, 10+ for exploratory searches

- `--verbose` or `-v`: Show full document content
  - Without this flag, only previews (first 200 chars) are shown
  - Use when you need to read the full conversation summary

- `--project PATH` or `-p PATH`: Override default project root (default: ~/codecompanion-history/summaries)

- `--help` or `-h`: Show help message

## Saving Memories

To save a new conversation summary:

```bash
echo 'YOUR_SUMMARY_MARKDOWN' | ~/.config/opencode/skills/codecompanion-memory/save-summary.sh --title "Title"
```

### Save Parameters

- `--title TEXT` or `-t TEXT`: Title for the summary (optional but recommended)
- `--dir PATH` or `-d PATH`: Override summaries directory (default: ~/codecompanion-history/summaries)
- `--help` or `-h`: Show help message

The summary should be passed via stdin as markdown content.

### Summary Format

When saving a summary, use this structure:

```markdown
# Descriptive Title

## Date
YYYY-MM-DD

## Project Context
- **Working Directory**: /path/to/project
- **Project Root**: /path/to/project

## Summary
2-3 paragraph summary of what was discussed and key decisions made.

## Key Topics
- Topic 1
- Topic 2

## Technical Details
Important technical information, code patterns, or solutions.

## Code Changes
List of files modified with brief descriptions.

## Outcome
What was the result? Was the problem solved?

## Tags
python, docker, authentication, bug-fix
```

## Example Queries

### Finding Past Solutions

```bash
# User: "I'm getting a CORS error, have we dealt with this before?"
~/.config/opencode/skills/codecompanion-memory/query.sh \
  --query "CORS error HTTP request" \
  --count 3
```

### Architectural Decisions

```bash
# User: "What database did we choose for the user service?"
~/.config/opencode/skills/codecompanion-memory/query.sh \
  --query "database choice user service" \
  --count 5 \
  --verbose
```

### Code Patterns

```bash
# User: "How did I implement authentication last time?"
~/.config/opencode/skills/codecompanion-memory/query.sh \
  --query "authentication implementation pattern" \
  --count 3 \
  --verbose
```

## Output Format

Query results are displayed in order of relevance:

```
Searching in: /home/user/codecompanion-history/summaries
Query: Arduino

--- Result 1 ---
Path: 1759511459.md
Preview: ## Code Context
**Files Modified**: ardoise.ino (main focus: refactoring BLE write logic)...

--- Result 2 ---
Path: 1759512219.md
Preview: ## Code Context
**Files Modified**: ardoise.ino (main Arduino sketch)...
```

Each result includes:
- **Path**: The markdown file containing the full conversation summary
- **Preview/Document**: Either a short preview or full content (with `--verbose`)

You can read the full conversation summary files at:
`~/codecompanion-history/summaries/<chat_id>.md`

## How It Works

```
User Query
    |
Bash Script (query.sh)
    |
VectorCode CLI
    |
ChromaDB (local instance)
    |
Semantic Search Results
```

The skill:
1. Wraps the VectorCode CLI tool
2. Queries a local ChromaDB database
3. Uses semantic embeddings (SentenceTransformer)
4. Returns results sorted by relevance

## Database Information

- **Database Location**: `~/.local/share/vectorcode/chromadb/chroma.sqlite3`
- **Summaries**: `~/codecompanion-history/summaries/*.md`
- **Embedding Model**: SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

The database uses **semantic embeddings**, meaning:
- Queries find conceptually similar content, not just keyword matches
- Synonyms and related terms are automatically understood
- Context and meaning are preserved across different phrasings

## Shared Between Neovim and OpenCode

Summaries from both sources are stored in the same location:
- **Neovim (codecompanion-history.nvim)**: Uses the `gcs` keymap to generate summaries
- **OpenCode**: Uses the `/sum` command to generate summaries

Both are indexed by VectorCode and searchable from either environment.

## Dependencies

- `bash`: Shell interpreter
- `python3`: For JSON parsing in the query script
- `vectorcode`: CLI tool for querying/indexing ChromaDB

### Installing VectorCode

If VectorCode is not installed:

```bash
# Using pipx (recommended)
pipx install vectorcode

# Or using uv
uv tool install vectorcode

# Or using pip
pip install --user vectorcode

# Verify installation
which vectorcode
```

## Troubleshooting

### "vectorcode command not found"

```bash
# Install VectorCode
pipx install vectorcode

# Or check installation
which vectorcode
```

### "No results found"

- Try broader queries: "Docker" instead of "Docker Compose networking with custom bridge"
- Check if conversations are indexed: `ls ~/codecompanion-history/summaries/`
- Verify database exists: `ls ~/.local/share/vectorcode/chromadb/`
- Re-index summaries: `cd ~/codecompanion-history/summaries && vectorcode vectorise --pipe *.md`

### VectorCode configuration

If you have a ChromaDB Docker container and want VectorCode to use it, create:

```bash
# ~/codecompanion-history/summaries/.vectorcode.toml
[default]
db_url = "http://localhost:8001"
db_path = ""
```

Note: The skill works fine with VectorCode's default local database.

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with general queries, then refine based on results
2. **Use verbose mode selectively**: Only when you need full context to answer the user's question
3. **Combine with code search**: This skill finds conversations; use code search tools to find actual implementations
4. **Cite your sources**: Tell the user which conversation(s) you found the information in
5. **Verify information**: Past solutions might be outdated; always validate before applying

## Example Workflow

```
User: "I'm stuck on the same authentication bug we had last month"

Step 1: Search for relevant conversations
$ ./query.sh --query "authentication bug fix" --count 5

Step 2: Review results, identify the most relevant conversation
> Result 3 seems most relevant (Path: 1763841695.md)

Step 3: Read full summary if needed
$ cat ~/codecompanion-history/summaries/1763841695.md

Step 4: Apply the solution or adapt it to current context

Step 5: Inform user
> "I found a similar issue we solved in conversation 1763841695. 
   The problem was related to session token expiration. 
   Here's what we did..."
```
