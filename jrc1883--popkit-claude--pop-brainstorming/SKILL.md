# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the brainstorming skill to refine this idea into a design."

## Step 0: GitHub-First Check (Required)

**BEFORE brainstorming**, verify this work hasn't been done or planned:

### 1. Search GitHub Issues

```bash
# Search for existing/related issues
gh issue list --search "<topic keywords>" --state all --json number,title,state --limit 10
```

### 2. Search Existing Skills and Code

```bash
# Search for related skills
grep -r "<keywords>" packages/plugin/skills/ --include="SKILL.md" -l

# Search for related utilities
grep -r "<keywords>" packages/plugin/hooks/utils/ --include="*.py" -l
```

### 3. Check Upstream Context

```python
# Check if another skill passed context to us
from popkit_shared.utils.skill_context import load_skill_context

ctx = load_skill_context()
if ctx and ctx.previous_output:
    # Use existing context instead of re-asking
    topic = ctx.previous_output.get("topic")
    existing_decisions = ctx.shared_decisions
```

### 4. Present Findings via AskUserQuestion

If related issues or code found:

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool with:
- question: "Found existing work related to '<topic>'. How should we proceed?"
- header: "Existing"
- options:
  - label: "Use existing"
    description: "Build on what's already there"
  - label: "Enhance"
    description: "Extend existing with new features"
  - label: "Start fresh"
    description: "Create new (explain why existing doesn't fit)"
- multiSelect: false
```

**Only proceed to brainstorming after completing this check.**

## User Interaction Pattern

**ALWAYS use AskUserQuestion** for decisions and clarifications:

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool with:
- question: Clear, specific question ending with "?"
- header: Short label (max 12 chars): "Approach", "Auth", "Database"
- options: 2-4 choices with labels and descriptions
- multiSelect: false (unless multiple selections make sense)
```

**NEVER present options as plain text** like "1. Option A, 2. Option B - type 1 or 2".

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea using AskUserQuestion
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs using AskUserQuestion
- Each option should have a clear label and description explaining trade-offs
- Lead with your recommended option by listing it first

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- Write the validated design to `.claude/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Commit the design document to git

**Context Handoff (for downstream skills):**

```python
# Save context for pop-writing-plans or other downstream skills
from popkit_shared.utils.skill_context import save_skill_context, SkillOutput, link_workflow_to_issue

# Save design output
save_skill_context(SkillOutput(
    skill_name="pop-brainstorming",
    status="completed",
    output={
        "topic": "<topic>",
        "approach": "<chosen approach>",
        "design_summary": "<brief summary>"
    },
    artifacts=[".claude/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md"],
    next_suggested="pop-writing-plans",
    decisions_made=[<list of AskUserQuestion results>]
))

# If GitHub issue exists, link it
if issue_number:
    link_workflow_to_issue(issue_number)
```

**Create or Link GitHub Issue:**

```bash
# If no issue exists, offer to create one
gh issue create --title "[Design] <topic>" --body "Design document: .claude/plans/..."
```

**Implementation (if continuing):**

- Use AskUserQuestion: "Design complete. What's next?"
- Options: "Create implementation plan", "Create issue only", "Done for now"
- Use pop:writing-plans skill to create detailed implementation plan (receives context automatically)

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Always use AskUserQuestion** - Interactive prompts, never plain text options
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## PDF Input Support

When provided with a PDF file path (design doc, spec, or requirements), read it first:

```
User: Here's the design doc: /path/to/design.pdf
```

**Process PDF input:**

1. Use Read tool to analyze the PDF content
2. Extract key requirements, constraints, and goals
3. Identify areas that need clarification
4. Use extracted context to inform the brainstorming process

**When reading design PDFs:**

- Look for: objectives, user stories, constraints, success criteria
- Note gaps: missing acceptance criteria, unclear requirements
- Identify: dependencies, technical constraints, timeline pressures
- Flag: ambiguities that need clarification during brainstorming

This allows brainstorming to start from existing documentation rather than from scratch.
