# Code Review with Confidence Filtering

## Overview

Review code for bugs, quality issues, and project conventions with confidence-based filtering. Only reports HIGH confidence issues to reduce noise.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often. Filter out false positives.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**

- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**

- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## Confidence Scoring

Each identified issue receives a confidence score (0-100):

| Score | Meaning              | Action             |
| ----- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0     | Not a real problem   | Ignore             |
| 25    | Possibly valid       | Ignore             |
| 50    | Moderately confident | Note for reference |
| 75    | Highly confident     | Report             |
| 100   | Absolutely certain   | Report as critical |

**Threshold: 80+** - Only issues scoring 80 or higher are reported.

## Filter Out

- Pre-existing problems (not introduced in this change)
- Linter-catchable issues (let the linter handle it)
- Pedantic nitpicks (style preferences without substance)
- Hypothetical edge cases (unlikely to occur in practice)

## Review Categories

### 1. Simplicity/DRY/Elegance

- Code duplication
- Unnecessary complexity
- Missed abstractions
- Overly clever code

### 2. Bugs/Correctness

- Logic errors
- Edge case handling
- Type safety issues
- Error handling gaps

### 3. Conventions/Abstractions

- Project pattern compliance
- Naming conventions
- File organization
- Import patterns

## Output Format

```markdown

- **Fix**: How to fix it

### Assessment

**Ready to merge?** Yes / No / With fixes

**Reasoning**: [1-2 sentences explaining the assessment]

### Quality Score: [X/10]
```

## How to Request Review

**1. Get git SHAs:**

```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**2. Dispatch code-reviewer subagent:**

- What was implemented
- Plan or requirements reference
- Base and head commits
- Brief description

**3. Act on feedback:**

- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Parallel Review

Launch 3 code-reviewer agents in parallel with different focuses:

1. **Simplicity Focus**: DRY, elegance, unnecessary complexity
2. **Correctness Focus**: Bugs, edge cases, error handling
3. **Conventions Focus**: Project patterns, naming, organization

Consolidate findings and filter by confidence threshold.

## Red Flags

**Never:**

- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer wrong:**

- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
- Request clarification

## Key Principle

"Ask what you want to do" - After presenting issues, ask the user how to proceed rather than making assumptions.

## Receiving Code Review Feedback

This section covers how to **respond** to review feedback, not how to give it.

### The Process

```
Feedback Received → Read ALL → Verify → Evaluate → Implement → Respond
```

**Step 1: Read ALL Comments Before Implementing ANY**

Items may be related. Partial understanding = wrong implementation.

- Read every comment completely
- Note dependencies between suggestions
- Understand the reviewer's overall intent
- Don't react until you've read everything

**Step 2: Verify Against Actual Code**

Don't assume the reviewer is right. Check:

```
For each suggestion:
  - Does this code path actually exist?
  - Does the suggested fix compile/work?
  - Will it break existing functionality?
  - Is the edge case real or hypothetical?
```

**Step 3: Evaluate Technical Soundness**

Push back on technically questionable suggestions:

| Reviewer Says                          | Your Response                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| "This could fail if..." (hypothetical) | "Is this edge case actually reachable? Show me the path." |
| "Use pattern X instead"                | "Does X fit our architecture? What's the trade-off?"      |
| "This is inefficient"                  | "Is this a hot path? Premature optimization?"             |
| "Add validation for Y"                 | "Is Y possible given our type system?"                    |

**Disagree with technical reasoning, not emotion.** If you're right, show evidence.

**Step 4: Implement Strategically**

Order matters:

1. **Blocking issues first** - Things that prevent merge
2. **Simple fixes next** - Quick wins to show progress
3. **Complex refactoring last** - Needs more thought

**One commit per logical change.** Makes it easier for re-review.

**Step 5: Respond to Each Comment**

| Situation          | Response                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Fixed the issue    | "Fixed in [commit]" or just resolve the comment    |
| Disagree           | Technical reasoning why, ask for their perspective |
| Need clarification | Ask specific question, don't guess                 |
| Won't fix          | Explain why (tech debt ticket? out of scope?)      |

### What NOT to Do

**Performative Agreement:**

```
BAD: "Great point! You're absolutely right! I'll fix that immediately!"
GOOD: "Fixed" or "Good catch" or just the fix itself
```

Actions demonstrate engagement better than words.

**Blind Implementation:**

```
BAD: Immediately implementing every suggestion without verification
GOOD: Verify suggestion makes sense for YOUR codebase, then implement
```

**Defensive Reactions:**

```
BAD: "Well actually, I wrote it this way because..."
GOOD: "Here's why I chose this approach: [technical reason]. Does that change your recommendation?"
```

### When Reviewer is Wrong

It happens. Handle professionally:

1. **Verify you understand** - Restate their concern
2. **Show evidence** - Code, tests, docs that support your approach
3. **Offer alternative** - "Would X address your concern while keeping Y?"
4. **Escalate if needed** - Get another opinion

Don't:

- Silently ignore feedback
- Implement something you know is wrong
- Get emotional or defensive

### Red Flags in Your Own Behavior

Stop if you're:

- Implementing without understanding
- Agreeing to avoid conflict
- Skipping comments you don't like
- Getting frustrated at reviewer
- Thinking "they don't understand the code"

---

## Cross-References

- **Testing feedback:** Review tests as rigorously as code (see `pop-test-driven-development`)
- **Debugging from feedback:** If review reveals bug, use `pop-systematic-debugging`
- **Root cause:** Don't just fix symptoms reviewer points out, trace to root cause
