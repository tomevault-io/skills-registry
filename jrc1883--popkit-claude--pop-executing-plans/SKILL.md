# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## Workflow

See [examples/workflow-definition.yml](examples/workflow-definition.yml) for complete workflow.

**Key phases:**

1. Load and critically review plan
2. Execute batch (default: 3 tasks)
3. Report results and get feedback
4. Continue, revise, or pause based on feedback
5. Complete with finishing-a-development-branch
6. Present next action options (Issue #118)

## Execution Process

See [examples/batch-execution-guide.md](examples/batch-execution-guide.md) for detailed process.

**Key points:**

- **Default batch size**: 3 tasks
- **Checkpoint after each batch**: Report and wait for feedback
- **TodoWrite integration**: Track progress through tasks
- **Verification**: Run all verification steps as specified in plan
- **Stop when blocked**: Ask for help, don't guess

## PDF Plan Support

Plans can be provided as Markdown or PDF format.

See [examples/pdf-plan-support.md](examples/pdf-plan-support.md) for PDF processing details.

**Supported formats:**

- Markdown implementation plans
- PDF implementation plans
- PDF PRDs (for context)

## Quality Gates

**Stop and ask for help when:**

- Plan has concerns or gaps before starting
- Hit blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, failing test, unclear instruction)
- Verification fails repeatedly
- Don't understand an instruction

**Don't force through blockers** - ask for clarification.

## Batch Feedback

After each batch, use AskUserQuestion with options:

- **Continue**: Proceed to next batch
- **Revise**: Apply feedback to current batch
- **Pause**: Stop and save progress

See [examples/batch-execution-guide.md](examples/batch-execution-guide.md) for templates.

## Next Action Loop (Issue #118)

**CRITICAL**: After completion, ALWAYS present next actions:

- Work on another issue
- Run tests/checks
- Session capture and exit

**NEVER end without presenting next step options.**

See [examples/batch-execution-guide.md](examples/batch-execution-guide.md#step-6-next-action-loop-critical---issue-118) for implementation.

## Integration

**Upstream skills:**

- **pop-writing-plans**: Provides implementation plan
- **pop-brainstorming**: Provides design context

**Downstream skills:**

- **pop-finishing-a-development-branch**: Called after all tasks complete
- **pop-session-capture**: Called when pausing execution

**Internal agents:**

- **code-explorer**: Loads and parses plans
- **code-architect**: Reviews plans and implements tasks
- **test-writer-fixer**: Runs verification steps

## Related Skills

- **pop-writing-plans**: Create the implementation plan
- **pop-finishing-a-development-branch**: Complete development after tasks done
- **pop-session-capture**: Save progress when pausing
- **pop-subagent-driven**: Alternative execution with fresh subagent per task

## Remember

- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
