# Automated Inbox Processing

Process inbox items: read intent, classify, file, rename, connect, and update living docs. Designed for the librarian agent but usable standalone.

## Input

- **Specific file(s)**: Process only the named files in `0-Inbox/`
- **No argument**: Process all files in `0-Inbox/`

## Process Per Item

### 1. Read and Understand Intent

Read the note. Check frontmatter for intent signals left by the writer or thinker:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `filing-hint` | Suggested destination (area name, project name, "resource", "unsure") |
| `context` | Freeform context — what prompted this, what it relates to |
| `source: thinker` | Came from a synthesis session — handle with care |
| `type` | dump, note, clip, edit |
| `tags` | Knowledge role: seed, thread, tool, question, insight |

If no intent signals, classify from content.

### 2. Determine Destination

Filing cascade (first match wins):

1. **Project?** → Does this help an active project? Check project briefs for goal alignment.
2. **Area?** → Does this relate to an ongoing area? Match against area scopes.
3. **Resource?** → Is this reference material? Route to correct sub-folder (clips/short-form/long-form/books/videos).
4. **None?** → Archive or flag for user.

When `filing-hint` exists, treat as strong signal but verify.

### 3. Confirm with Semantic Search

```bash
qmd vsearch "key content from the note" --files
```

**Auto-file** when:
- Semantic search confirms (3+ top results in same location)
- Content clearly matches one area/project's scope
- `filing-hint` aligns with search results

**Ask the user** when:
- Top matches span multiple areas
- Content is vague or multi-topic
- `filing-hint: unsure` or missing with no clear match

### 4. Archive Original

Preserve the raw capture before modifying. Rename to `YYYY-MM-DD_descriptive-slug.md` but keep frontmatter and content as-is — naming is the one thing we always enforce, even on raw archives:

```bash
mkdir -p "04-archive/inbox"
cp "0-Inbox/original-name.md" "04-archive/inbox/YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md"
```

### 5. Fix Frontmatter

- Set `type: note` if missing (keep original type if appropriate)
- Set `created: YYYY-MM-DD` using today's date if missing
- Validate tags against the 5-tag vocabulary (`#seed`, `#thread`, `#tool`, `#question`, `#insight`)
- Set appropriate `status` (draft, refining, or omit for stable)
- **Remove intent fields**: Strip `filing-hint`, `context`, `source` — they served their purpose

### 6. Rename and Move

Rename to `YYYY-MM-DD_descriptive-slug.md`, then move to destination:

```bash
mv "0-Inbox/original-name.md" "2-Areas/area-name/YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md"
```

### 7. Update Living Docs

Read the parent MOC or project brief. Add the note with annotation:

```markdown
- [[YYYY-MM-DD_slug]] — brief description of what the note covers
```

For **thinker synthesis** (`source: thinker`):
- Check if the synthesis updates the MOC's thesis paragraph
- Check if it resolves any Open Questions
- Update source notes' `## Related` sections

### 8. Build Connections

Find related notes via semantic search and structural analysis. Add `## Related` section if strong connections exist. Only add connections that are clear and useful.

## Special: Edit Notes

For notes with `type: edit`:
1. Read the `targets` array from frontmatter
2. Read each target file
3. Apply the described edits
4. Archive the edit note

## Processing Report

After processing, show summary:

```
## Inbox Processing Report

### Filed
- "Raw thoughts on agents" → 2-Areas/ai-dev-ecosystem/2025-02-07_agent-thoughts.md
- "Market data notes" → 1-Projects/polymarket-framework/2025-02-07_market-data.md

### Living Docs Updated
- 00_ai-dev-ecosystem.md — added link to agent-thoughts
- 00_polymarket-framework.md — added link to market-data

### Connections Found
- agent-thoughts ↔ agentic-primitives (shared concepts)

### Needs Attention
- "Ambiguous note" — couldn't determine destination, left in inbox
```

## After Batch Processing

Reindex semantic search:
```bash
qmd update
```
