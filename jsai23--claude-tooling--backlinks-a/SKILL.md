> **Action skill** — Backlink suggestion workflow: structural search, semantic search, cross-area scan, strength grouping.

# Backlink Discovery

Find and suggest appropriate `[[wikilinks]]` for a note using structural analysis and semantic search.

## Process

Given a file path:

### 1. Read the Target Note

Read the note's content. Identify its area/project, key concepts, tags, and existing links.

### 2. Structural Search

- **Inbound links**: Grep the vault for `[[note-name]]` to find all notes that already link TO this note.
- **Parent MOC**: Read the area/project MOC (`00_` file) to see what's linked and how sections are organized.
- **Sibling notes**: List other notes in the same folder to find potential connections.

### 3. Semantic Search

Run `qmd vsearch` with the note's key sentences or title to find semantically similar notes across the vault.

```bash
qmd vsearch "the key concept from the note" --files
```

Use 2-3 queries with different phrasings for better coverage.

### 4. Cross-Area Scan

Check MOCs in related areas for potential cross-links. Read MOCs from areas that share concepts with the target note.

For example, if the note is in `ai-dev-ecosystem` and mentions statistical concepts, check `00_math-stats.md`.

### 5. Tag-Based Discovery

Look for notes with the same knowledge-role tags that might be conceptually related:
- `#thread` notes in the same area → likely part of the same developing narrative
- `#question` notes → might pose questions this note answers (or vice versa)
- `#tool` notes → frameworks that apply to this note's topic
- `#insight` notes → crystallized understanding related to this note's seeds/threads

### 6. Present Suggestions

Group suggestions by strength:

**Strong matches** — Same area, high semantic similarity, shared concepts:
```
- [[2025-01-21_agentic-primitives]] — shares agent architecture concepts
  → Add to note's ## Related section
```

**Cross-area connections** — Different area, meaningful overlap:
```
- [[00_modeling]] (modeling area) — note discusses model capabilities
  → Add cross-link in note's ## Related section
```

**MOC links** — MOCs that should reference this note:
```
- [[00_ai-dev-ecosystem]] — note not yet linked in area MOC
  → Add to MOC's appropriate section with annotation
```

### 7. Apply on Confirmation

For each accepted suggestion:

- **Note → Note links**: Add to the target note's `## Related` section at the bottom. Create the section if it doesn't exist.
- **MOC links**: Add the note to the parent MOC in the appropriate section with annotation.

## Backlink Rules

- Link when the connection is clear and useful — don't force it
- Prefer linking to MOCs for high-level connections
- Bidirectional by nature — Obsidian shows backlinks automatically, only write the link in one direction
- Cross-area links are encouraged

## Related Section Format

```markdown
## Related

- [[2025-01-21_agentic-primitives]] — agent building blocks
- [[00_modeling]] — model capabilities that enable agentic workflows
```

Keep annotations brief. One phrase describing why the link matters.
