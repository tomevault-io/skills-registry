# Living Documents

Living docs evolve as understanding shifts. They synthesize — not just list. Two types exist in the vault: **MOCs** and **Project Briefs**.

## Types of Living Documents

### MOC (Map of Content)

**Purpose**: Synthesize an area's knowledge into navigable structure.

**Not an index.** A MOC tells you what you know about a topic and how it fits together.

```markdown
---
type: moc
level: 0
created: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Area Name

{Thesis paragraph: current understanding. Updated when understanding shifts.}

## Section Name
- [[note-name]] — what it covers, why it matters
- [[other-note]] — key insight from this note

## Another Section
- [[yet-another]] — brief annotation

## Open Questions
- What you don't know yet
- Gaps in understanding

---
Sources cross-linked from: [[00_related-area]], [[00_another-area]]
```

**What makes it living:**
- Thesis paragraph evolves as understanding deepens
- Sections reorganize as the area's structure becomes clearer
- Annotations get refined (not "see this" but "key insight: X")
- Open Questions get resolved, new ones added
- Cross-links grow as connections are discovered

**L0 vs L1:**
- `00_area-name.md` (L0) — one per area, always exists, synthesizes broadly
- `01_subtopic.md` (L1) — only when 15+ notes cluster. L0 references L1; L1 goes deep.
- Never L2. If L1 needs splitting, scope is wrong.

### Project Brief

**Purpose**: Track a project's state, resources, decisions, and next actions.

```markdown
---
type: project
status: active
created: YYYY-MM-DD
goal: "One-sentence objective"
deadline: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Project Name

{Current status paragraph: what's done, what's in progress, what's blocked.}

## Resources
- [[00_area-moc]] — area knowledge feeding this project
- [[resource-note]] — specific reference material

## Backlog
- [ ] Concrete task
- [ ] Another task

## Decisions
- Decision made and why
- Another decision with rationale
```

**What makes it living:**
- Status paragraph reflects current reality, not aspirational state
- Backlog is actual next steps, maintained as items complete
- Resources grow as relevant notes and references are discovered
- Decisions capture rationale so future-you understands past choices

## Signals a Living Doc Needs Updating

- New notes filed in the area/project that aren't linked yet
- An Open Question now has an answer in a recent note
- Thesis paragraph no longer reflects what the notes actually say
- Project status paragraph is stale (work happened but brief wasn't updated)
- Sections don't match actual note clustering (structural drift)
- Cross-links missing to areas that have grown relevant

## When to Create vs Update

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Filing a new note | Update parent MOC — add link with annotation |
| Understanding shifted | Update MOC thesis paragraph |
| New notes cluster on subtopic (15+) | Create L1 sub-MOC |
| Starting a new project | Create project brief |
| Project milestone hit | Update project brief status + decisions |
| Area has no MOC | Create L0 MOC |

## Anti-Patterns

- Flat bullet list of links with no annotations → not synthesized
- Thesis unchanged in months → probably stale
- No Open Questions → either perfect understanding (unlikely) or not used for thinking
- Project brief with aspirational backlog → not reflecting reality
- Sections that don't match note clustering → structural drift

## Updating a Living Doc

When invoked with an area name or file path:

### 1. Read the Target
Read the MOC or project brief.

### 2. Scan the Area/Project
List all notes. Read frontmatter and first few paragraphs of each.

### 3. Identify Gaps
- **Unlinked notes**: Notes not referenced in the living doc
- **Outdated sections**: Don't reflect current notes
- **Stale Open Questions**: Now answered by existing notes
- **Missing cross-links**: Related area MOCs that should be referenced
- **Annotation gaps**: Links with vague or missing annotations

### 4. Propose Updates
Present specific edits:

```
## Proposed Updates to 00_ai-dev-ecosystem.md

1. ADD to "Agent Architecture" section:
   - [[2025-02-05_agent-note]] — multi-agent orchestration patterns

2. UPDATE thesis paragraph:
   Add sentence about multi-agent patterns emerging as dominant architecture

3. RESOLVE Open Question:
   "How does memory continuity work?" → answered in [[2025-02-01_memory-patterns]]
```

### 5. Execute on Confirmation
Apply edits. Only modify the living doc — never the notes themselves.
