> **Knowledge skill** — Tag vocabulary and rules: the 5-tag system, design principles, lifecycle, valid combinations.

# Tag Management

Manage the vault's intent-based tag vocabulary. Tags express the **role a note plays in your thinking** — orthogonal to PARA (which handles location) and `type` (which handles what it is).

## Tag Vocabulary

5 tags. Each describes the note's role in your knowledge system:

| Tag | Role | When to Use |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `#seed` | Raw spark | Early idea, observation, unprocessed thought. Needs development. |
| `#thread` | Developing narrative | Part of a bigger picture, connects to ongoing thinking. Being actively developed. |
| `#tool` | Applicable method | Framework, technique, mental model, methodology. Something to apply. |
| `#question` | Open gap | Unresolved question, gap in understanding, thing to figure out. |
| `#insight` | Crystallized understanding | Key takeaway, "aha" moment, settled understanding. |

### Design Principles

- **Cross-cutting**: A `#seed` in math-stats and a `#seed` in ai-dev-ecosystem both mean "needs development"
- **Intent-based**: Tags express what you want to DO with the knowledge
- **Orthogonal to PARA**: Areas handle topics, tags handle knowledge roles
- **Not status**: Note maturity lives in the `status` frontmatter field (`draft`, `refining`, or omitted for stable)

### Tag Combinations

Tags can combine: `[seed, question]` (a question that's still raw), `[tool, insight]` (a framework you've crystallized). Keep to 1-2 tags. If you need 3+, the note probably needs splitting.

### Tag Lifecycle

Notes naturally move through tags as understanding develops:
```
#seed → #thread → #insight (ideas that crystallize)
#seed → #question → #insight (questions that get answered)
#tool stays #tool (methods are stable once captured)
```

## Mode 1: Tag a Note

**Trigger**: `/tags path/to/note.md`

1. Read the note's content and frontmatter
2. Determine the note's role:
   - Is it a raw, undeveloped thought? → `#seed`
   - Is it part of a developing line of thinking? → `#thread`
   - Is it a framework/method/technique? → `#tool`
   - Does it pose or explore an unanswered question? → `#question`
   - Has it crystallized a clear understanding? → `#insight`
3. Show current tags vs. suggested tags
4. On confirmation, edit the frontmatter `tags:` field

## Mode 2: Audit Tags

**Trigger**: `/tags --audit`

Scan all notes and report:

1. **Invalid tags**: Tags outside the 5-tag vocabulary
2. **Missing tags**: Notes with no `tags` field (exclude MOCs, project briefs)
3. **Stale seeds**: Notes tagged `#seed` older than 30 days — develop or archive
4. **Open questions**: All `#question` notes — any answered? Any resolvable?
5. **Tag distribution**: Count per tag across the vault

Exclude `_System/`, `.obsidian/`, `04-archive/` from scan.

## Mode 3: List by Tag

**Trigger**: `/tags --list`

Group all notes by tag:

```
## #seed (N notes)
- path/to/note.md

## #thread (N notes)
...

## #insight (N notes)
...

## #tool (N notes)
...

## #question (N notes)
...

## Untagged (N notes)
...
```
