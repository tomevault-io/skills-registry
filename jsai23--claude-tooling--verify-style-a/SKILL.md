# Code Style and Cleanliness

Line-level code quality without changing behavior.

## Slop (AI-Generated Cruft)

**Defensive code** — Try/catch around code that can't fail. Null checks on values that are never null. Fallbacks for impossible cases. Validation of internal values guaranteed by the type system.

**Over-engineering** — Abstractions for one-time operations. Interfaces with single implementations. Factory patterns for simple construction. Configuration for things that will never be configured.

**Verbosity** — Multiple lines that could be one. Intermediate variables that add nothing. Obvious comments that restate the code.

## Messy Code

**Naming** — Unclear names. Inconsistent naming across similar modules. Abbreviations that aren't obvious. Names that lie.

**Structure** — Functions doing multiple things. Files with mixed responsibilities. Duplicated logic. Complex conditionals that could be simplified.

**Dead code** — Unused imports. Unreachable branches. Functions nothing calls. Commented-out code.

## Fix Protocol

Find, fix, test. One issue at a time. If tests fail, revert and note why.

Not architecture review, not larp detection. Don't change behavior. "No issues found" is valid.

## Output Format

```
## Fixes Applied

### 1. {path}:{line} - {category}
BEFORE: {old code}
AFTER: {new code}
REASON: Why this was changed

## Skipped (tests failed)
- {path}:{line} - what you tried, why it broke tests

## Summary
- Fixed: N issues
- Skipped: M issues (would break tests)
- Lines removed: K
```
