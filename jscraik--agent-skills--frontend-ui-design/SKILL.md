## Standards snapshot (March 2026)
- Use React 19 guidance for client UI patterns and Next.js 16 guidance when the surface is a Next.js app.
- Treat Tailwind CSS v4 tokens and utilities as the baseline styling system unless the host project says otherwise.
- Hold web UI work to WCAG 2.2 AA, explicit focus behavior, and token-referenced measurements.
- Keep design-system outputs grounded in DTCG/W3C token structure and repo-native component conventions.

## Design-system integration
- Apply `frontend/ui/references/design-system-integration-contract.md` to keep typography, spacing, iconography, and semantic token usage consistent.
- Route token architecture, aliasing, and theme-slot governance changes to `design-system`; keep this skill focused on screen and component implementation.
- Use `frontend/ui/references/skill-routing-matrix-2026.md` to resolve overlap with `frontend-design`, `design-system`, and `ui-ux-creative-coding`.

## When to use
- Design or review standard product UI systems and components.
- Specify accessible screens, flows, states, and design-system changes.
- Plan or patch production UI for React, Apps SDK widgets, or Tauri web UI when the work is standard product design rather than experimental creative coding.
- Adapt an existing interface across mobile, tablet, desktop, print, or email contexts while keeping behavior and information architecture coherent.
- Shape visually led landing pages, websites, prototypes, or demos when art direction matters but the result still needs production-ready hierarchy and accessibility.
- Audit existing UI for accessibility, token use, state coverage, or implementation readiness.

## When not to use
- Motion-first or experimental creative-coding work. Use [`ui-ux-creative-coding`](/frontend/ui/ui-ux-creative-coding/SKILL.md).
- Backend or infra-only work with no UI surface.
- Brand-only exploration with no product UI deliverable.
- Broad ambiguous frontend-design requests that do not yet declare implementation intent. Start with [`frontend-design`](/frontend/ui/frontend-design/SKILL.md).

## Routing boundary contract
- Own requests with explicit implementation or redesign intent, including verbs like `build`, `implement`, `redesign`, `fix layout`, and `create screen`.
- Route to `design-system` when the primary outcome is shared token/alias/theme governance.
- Route to `ui-ux-creative-coding` when the visual direction is already set and the ask is motion polish only.
- Defer broad ambiguous asks to `frontend-design`, then accept handoff once scope is implementation-ready.

## Required inputs
- Target surface and stack.
- User goal, task-critical path, and constraints.
- Existing token, component, and layout conventions.
- Source assumptions and target-context constraints when adaptation is requested:
  - device class and orientation,
  - input model (touch, keyboard, pointer),
  - connectivity/performance expectations,
  - non-screen outputs like print/email when relevant.
- Visual direction inputs when relevant: brand posture, imagery constraints, and whether the surface is utility-first product UI or a visually led marketing/demo surface.
- Definition of done: accessibility, performance, visual review, or implementation depth.

## Deliverables
- UI brief and scope.
- For visually led surfaces: one visual thesis, one content plan, and one interaction thesis before component planning.
- Component or screen plan with states and accessibility behavior.
- Token-referenced implementation guidance.
- For adaptation work: a compact adaptation matrix covering what to keep, adapt, or redesign for each target context (layout, interaction, content density, and navigation).
- For recursive-learning runs: rubric-bound observations recorded against `references/learning-rubric.yaml` before any lesson is considered promotable.
- Verification checklist covering a11y, responsiveness, and state completeness.
- File plan or handoff path when code changes are in scope.

## Design Context Minimum
- Before proposing a visual direction, confirm three things:
  - who the interface is for,
  - what job they are trying to complete,
  - how the interface should feel while they do it.
- Treat existing code as evidence of current implementation, not definitive evidence of audience or brand intent.
- If the user request or repo docs already establish these points, proceed without extra questions.
- If not, ask only the smallest missing set of questions needed to avoid inventing the wrong tone or hierarchy.
- For recurring design work, suggest persisting a short design-context note in the repo's normal docs or instructions path when that would reduce repeated clarification.

## Copy and Tone
- Treat UX copy as part of the interface, not post-hoc decoration.
- Labels, buttons, errors, empty states, and success/loading text should all answer the user's immediate question:
  - what is this,
  - what happened,
  - what do I do next.
- Prefer object-action phrasing for actions and controls.
- Do not use placeholders as the only label.
- Avoid jargon unless the audience clearly expects it; when domain language is necessary, make the surrounding context plain.
- Error copy should explain the issue and the next step without blaming the user.

## Intensity Tuning
- When a surface feels bland, make one or two core elements more distinctive instead of turning everything up at once.
- When a surface feels loud, reduce intensity selectively:
  - desaturate secondary elements,
  - reduce competing weights,
  - remove decorative noise before muting the core signal.
- Quiet design should still have anchors. Bold design should still preserve hierarchy.
- Avoid the trap of making everything equally colorful, equally muted, equally large, or equally emphatic.

## Philosophy
- Design is a system: tokens to components to patterns to verification.
- Clarity and accessibility are default quality bars, not optional polish.
- Favor production-ready structure over abstract inspiration.
- Distinctive design is welcome, but trust and usability win ties.
- Use a practical framework: define task-critical states first, then tune visual expression.
- Make tradeoff calls explicit so we understand why usability decisions win under delivery pressure.
- Ask: "Why would this hierarchy help the user complete the core task faster?"
- Ask: "Can we implement this with existing patterns before inventing a new structure?"
- Ask: "What would break for keyboard and reduced-motion users if this choice is wrong?"

## Variation
- Vary output depth by request type:
  - implementation request: prioritize concrete component and state contracts;
  - redesign request: prioritize hierarchy, composition rhythm, and trust cues first.
- Adapt recommendations to context-specific constraints:
  - existing system: preserve token and component conventions unless there is a clear defect;
  - new surface: explore different hierarchy anchors before locking implementation details.
- Avoid repetitive templates; use different framing for utility-first product surfaces and visually led landing pages.

## Workflow
1. Frame the surface, user task, success condition, and design-context minimum.
2. If the surface is visually led, write three things before components:
   - visual thesis: one sentence for mood, material, and energy;
   - content plan: hero, support, detail, final CTA;
   - interaction thesis: 2-3 motions that materially change the feel of the page.
3. Map the key states: default, loading, empty, error, permission, and edge cases that matter.
4. If the task is adaptation-focused, run the cross-context pass in `references/cross-context-adaptation.md`:
   - capture source assumptions,
   - map target constraints,
   - decide what to keep, adapt, or redesign.
5. Anchor measurements to tokens instead of ad hoc values.
6. Define focus order, keyboard behavior, labels, contrast, and reduced-motion handling explicitly.
7. Align implementation guidance to the host stack: React 19 patterns, Next.js 16 where relevant, Tailwind v4 utilities/tokens, and Tauri/App SDK constraints when present.
8. For redesign requests, run the anti-generic audit pass in `references/redesign-audit-lens.md` before proposing visual polish.
9. Reuse bundled `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/FEATURE_DESIGN.template.md` when producing handoff structure or audit output.
10. Verify the proposed UI is implementable, accessible, and stable before calling it done.

## Cross-Context Adaptation
- Adaptation is not simple scaling. Treat it as a context shift in device constraints, interaction model, and user intent.
- Preserve core information architecture and primary actions across contexts; adapt presentation and interaction patterning, not product meaning.
- For adaptation-heavy requests, use `references/cross-context-adaptation.md` to build a source-to-target matrix covering:
  - layout strategy,
  - interaction/touch strategy,
  - content-priority strategy,
  - navigation strategy,
  - verification requirements on real devices and orientations.

## Visually Led Surfaces
- Use this track for branded landing pages, websites, prototypes, and demos where hierarchy, imagery, and restraint matter as much as correctness.
- Start with composition, not components. The first viewport should feel like a poster, not a document.
- Prefer one dominant visual anchor per section and one primary takeaway or action.
- Keep the brand or product name unmistakable in the first screen on branded surfaces.
- Use sparse copy, strong spacing, and image-led hierarchy before adding cards, badges, or decorative chrome.
- Distinguish branded surfaces from product surfaces:
  - branded landing pages may justify a full-bleed hero and stronger atmosphere;
  - utility-first product UI should default to orientation, status, and action rather than mood-setting copy.
- Treat cards as opt-in, not default. If a layout still works without the card treatment, remove it unless the card itself is the interaction.
- Motion should reinforce presence, hierarchy, or affordance. Do not add motion that only decorates.
- If imagery is present, it must do narrative work and leave a calm region for text. Decorative texture alone is not enough.

## Redesign Audit Lens
- Use this lens when modernizing an existing product surface that feels generic or inconsistent.
- Prioritize structural fixes before polish: hierarchy, state coverage, trust cues, and interaction clarity.
- Enforce realism in example content: avoid placeholder names, fake round metrics, and dead actions that point to `#`.
- Reference: `references/redesign-audit-lens.md`.

## Validation
- Confirm responses begin with `## When to use`, `## Inputs`, and `## Outputs` when the skill is used interactively.
- Confirm recursive-learning reviews record structured observations in `lesson_observations.json` and do not rewrite the skill from a single run.
- Confirm the audience, job to be done, and intended feel are explicit before visual-direction recommendations.
- Confirm primary-flow copy is specific, actionable, and tone-appropriate instead of generic filler.
- Confirm accessibility coverage includes focus, keyboard behavior, semantic naming, contrast, and reduced-motion parity.
- Confirm measurements and spacing decisions map back to tokens or documented exceptions.
- Confirm layout-first requests include explicit spacing/hierarchy/rhythm/density findings instead of generic "looks cleaner" statements.
- Confirm UI states are complete enough for real implementation, not just the happy path.
- Confirm adaptation requests include source assumptions, target constraints, and explicit keep/adapt/redesign decisions rather than a generic "make it responsive" answer.
- Confirm visually led work distinguishes branded landing pages from utility-first product UI and does not collapse both into the same layout language.
- Confirm the first viewport has a clear dominant visual or hierarchy anchor and that any card treatment is justified instead of habitual.
- Confirm intensity tuning preserves a small number of clear anchors rather than making the whole surface uniformly loud or uniformly flat.
- Confirm Storybook or equivalent visual review coverage is called out when components change materially.
- Confirm generated examples avoid generic AI fingerprints (placeholder copy/data, dead actions, repetitive card-grid defaults) unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Confirm typography, spacing, and icon usage decisions stay compliant with `frontend/ui/references/design-system-integration-contract.md`.
- Confirm routing decisions remain aligned with `frontend/ui/references/skill-routing-matrix-2026.md`.

## Constraints
- Do not add new heavy UI dependencies without approval.
- Do not trade away accessibility or reduced-motion parity for novelty.
- Keep outputs frontend-scoped unless the user explicitly asks for backend wiring that is necessary for UI state.
- Never expose secrets, private URLs, or internal tokens in examples or handoff artifacts.

## Anti-patterns
- Designing only the default state and leaving failure states implicit.
- Using raw ad hoc spacing, radius, or color values when tokens should exist.
- Treating accessibility as a QA afterthought instead of part of the design contract.
- Returning generic “nice UI” advice with no state model or implementation path.
- Using hero-card mosaics, logo-cloud filler, or split attention layouts when one strong composition would communicate more clearly.
- Letting a headline overpower the brand on branded surfaces or using weak imagery that could be removed without changing the page.
- Polishing visuals while leaving core redesign issues unresolved (weak hierarchy, unclear primary action, missing edge states, or trust-critical context buried).

## Examples
- "Design a settings flow for a React app with accessible tabs and inline validation."
- "Design a visually strong landing page for a product launch with one dominant hero composition and restrained motion."
- "Adapt this desktop analytics workspace for mobile and tablet while preserving core tasks and avoiding hover-only interactions."
- "Review this component set for token drift, focus behavior, and responsive gaps."
- "Redesign this existing settings page to remove generic patterns while preserving stack constraints and accessibility."

## Remember
- Standard UI design work should feel production-ready, not pitch-deck-ready.
- A complete state model is part of quality.
- The best output makes implementation easier and regressions less likely.
- If the skill is running in learning mode, preserve repeated good and bad signals as structured observations first, then let `skill-builder` decide what is safe to promote.

## Gotchas
- None yet. Capture recurring failures here as symptom -> cause -> do instead -> check.

## Failure mode
- If the target surface, design constraints, or implementation boundaries are unclear, stop, surface the missing context, and fall back to a narrower component review before editing UI code.
