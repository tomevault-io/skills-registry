# Systematic Debugging

## When to use
- User reports failure, regression, test failure, instability, or unexpected behavior.
- The user needs a reproducible diagnosis before any code fix.

## Required inputs
- Observable symptoms (errors, stack traces, repro steps).
- Recent changes and recent deploy context.
- Environment details and execution constraints.
- Whether execution changes are allowed.

## Deliverables
- A structured diagnostic plan and prioritized root-cause hypothesis.
- Evidence list (commands, logs, file paths, and observed outputs).
- Recommended fix plan only after root cause confirmation.
- Explicit partial/blocked status when data is insufficient.
- Include `schema_version` in machine-readable output contracts.

## Procedure
### 1) Stabilize scope
- Reproduce consistently and collect error signatures first.
- Avoid speculative fixes before evidence.

### 2) Layered investigation
- Isolate component boundaries (client/server, CI/tooling/runtime, external dependencies).
- Confirm where signals drop and gather targeted evidence.

### 3) Hypothesis and verification
- Propose a narrow hypothesis linked to observed data.
- Add a minimal check for each hypothesis before change.

### 4) Fix only after confirmation
- Apply one minimal change at a time.
- Re-run checks to confirm the causal hypothesis.

## Constraints
- Redact secrets, tokens, credentials, and user identifiers in output.
- Prefer non-destructive commands; require explicit confirmation for risky commands.
- Respect user-defined execution limits and approval gates.

## Anti-patterns
- Guessing without reproducible evidence.
- Multiple speculative edits in one cycle.
- Declaring completion from partial checks.
- Skipping regression checks after a fix.

## Validation
- Stop and confirm at the first hard blocker.
- Include clear "blocked", "partial", or "complete" status with verification evidence.
- If no reproducible command can confirm the fix, return partial + next required data.
- Validation is fail-fast: if any blocking check fails or evidence is insufficient, stop and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

## Variation
- Vary investigation depth by incident criticality: start with one narrow, high-confidence hypothesis path and only add additional branches when the first set of checks is inconclusive.

## Examples
- "The test suite started failing after yesterday's refactor; can you inspect the first regression point and validate the blast radius?"
- "I see intermittent timeouts in CI; help me identify the root-cause path before proposing a fix."
- "Please debug a 500 error that only appears when feature flags are enabled."

## Failure mode
- If key logs, config, or context is missing, ask concise follow-up questions and pause execution.
- If an investigation path is blocked by permissions or missing tooling, provide a safe fallback plan.

## Philosophy
- Keep the workflow evidence-driven and reversible.
- Root cause comes before remediation.
- One proven change is better than a chain of speculative fixes.

## Gotchas
- None yet. Capture recurring failures here as symptom -> cause -> do instead -> check.
