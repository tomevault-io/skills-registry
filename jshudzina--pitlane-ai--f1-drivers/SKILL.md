# F1 Driver Information

You have access to F1 driver information via the workspace-based PitLane CLI which uses FastF1's Ergast API. Answer questions about F1 drivers past and present with accurate reference data.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users ask about:
- **Driver codes**: "What's Verstappen's driver code?" or "What is VER's full name?"
- **Driver details**: "Tell me about Lewis Hamilton" or "When was Max Verstappen born?"
- **Season rosters**: "Who drove in 2024?" or "List all drivers from the 2023 season"
- **Driver search**: "Find Dutch drivers" or "Show me all drivers"
- **Wikipedia links**: "Show me Max Verstappen's Wikipedia page"

**Complementary with f1-analyst**: This skill provides driver reference data. Use f1-analyst for performance analysis (lap times, race results).

## Step 1: Identify Query Parameters

Extract from the user's question:
- **Driver Code**: 3-letter abbreviation (e.g., "VER", "HAM", "LEC")
- **Season**: Year (e.g., 2024, 2023) to get all drivers from that season
- **Limit**: Number of results (default: 100)
- **Offset**: Pagination offset (default: 0)

## Step 2: Get Driver Data Using PitLane CLI

### Search by Driver Code
```bash
pitlane fetch driver-info --driver-code VER
```
Returns information for Max Verstappen and saves to workspace.

### Get All Drivers from a Season
```bash
pitlane fetch driver-info --season 2024
```
Returns all drivers who participated in the 2024 season (~20 drivers).

### Get All F1 Drivers in History
```bash
pitlane fetch driver-info --limit 50
```
Returns up to 50 drivers from F1 history (1950-present).

### Pagination for Large Results
```bash
pitlane fetch driver-info --limit 100 --offset 100
```
Gets drivers 101-200 from the complete dataset.

The CLI returns a JSON result with a `data_file` path. Use the Read tool to read that file for the full driver data.

## Step 3: Format Your Response

### For Single Driver Queries
```markdown
## Max Verstappen (VER)

**Full Name**: Max Verstappen
**Nationality**: Dutch
**Born**: September 30, 1997
**Driver Number**: 1
**Driver Code**: VER

[Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen)
```

### For Season Roster Queries
Present as a table:
```markdown
## 2024 F1 Drivers

| Code | Name | Number | Nationality |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| VER | Max Verstappen | 1 | Dutch |
| HAM | Lewis Hamilton | 44 | British |
| LEC | Charles Leclerc | 16 | Monegasque |
...
```

### For Driver Code Lookups
When users ask "what's the driver code for X?":
- Provide the 3-letter code prominently (e.g., "VER")
- Clarify it's used in f1-analyst commands
- Show example: `pitlane lap-times --drivers VER`

## Data Field Reference

The script returns drivers with these fields:
- **driver_id**: Unique identifier (e.g., "verstappen")
- **driver_code**: 3-letter code (e.g., "VER") - used by f1-analyst
- **driver_number**: Car number (e.g., 1) - may be null for historical drivers
- **given_name**: First name
- **family_name**: Last name
- **full_name**: Combined full name
- **date_of_birth**: Birth date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **nationality**: Driver nationality
- **url**: Wikipedia page URL

## Example Questions and Approaches

**"What's Verstappen's driver code?"**
1. Run: `driver_info --driver-code VER`
2. Return "VER" prominently
3. Note this code is used in f1-analyst commands

**"Who drove in 2024?"**
1. Run: `driver_info --season 2024`
2. Present as a table with codes, names, numbers, nationalities
3. Include total count

**"Tell me about Lewis Hamilton"**
1. Run: `driver_info --driver-code HAM`
2. Present full details with Wikipedia link
3. Include biographical information

**"List all Dutch drivers"**
1. Run: `driver_info --limit 1000` (get all drivers)
2. Filter results by nationality = "Dutch"
3. Present as list or table

## Notes

- Driver codes are 3-letter abbreviations used by f1-analyst
- Data sourced from Ergast API via FastF1
- Historical data available back to 1950
- Not all historical drivers have driver numbers
- Wikipedia links are official URLs from Ergast database
