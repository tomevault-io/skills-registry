description: Generate a concise TLDR.md summary of the current session's key findings, decisions, and outcomes. Use when the user says "/tldr", "write a tldr", "summarize this session", "create a summary", or wants a shareable document capturing what happened in this conversation. Produces a clean, engineer-friendly markdown file ready to share before diving into full analysis. Use when this capability is needed.

# TLDR

Generate a `TLDR.md` file summarizing the current session for sharing with other engineers.

> **Archive root:** Resolve `$SESSION_KIT_ROOT` (default: `~/.stoobz`). All `~/.stoobz/` paths below use this root.

## Session Check-In (silent — before main process)

On first invocation of any session-kit skill in this session, register the active session in the manifest. See [session-checkin.md](../session-checkin.md) for the full protocol. Summary:

1. Detect session ID from most recently modified `.jsonl` in `~/.claude/projects/$(pwd | tr '/' '-')/` (fallback: git root encoding). If detection fails, skip silently.
2. Read `$SESSION_KIT_ROOT/manifest.json` (create if missing).
3. If no entry with this `session_id` exists → create active registration (`status: "active"`, `session_id`, `return_to`, `started_at`, `last_activity`, `last_exchange`, `skills_used`, nulls for label/summary/archive_path).
4. If entry exists → update `last_activity`, `last_exchange`, append this skill to `skills_used`.
5. Write manifest. Proceed to main process. No output about check-in.

## Process

1. **Check for existing file** — Read `./.stoobz/TLDR.md` if it exists. If found:
   - Preserve previous content under a `## Previous Session` heading
   - Add new content as the primary (top) section with updated timestamp
   - This creates a rolling history — latest session first

2. Review the full conversation to extract:
   - **What was investigated/built** — the problem or task
   - **Key findings** — discoveries, root causes, data points
   - **Decisions made** — choices and their rationale
   - **Actions taken** — code changes, config updates, commands run
   - **Open items** — unresolved questions, next steps, follow-ups

3. Write `.stoobz/TLDR.md` in the current working directory using the format below.

4. Confirm the file path and offer to adjust if needed.

## Output Format

```markdown
# TLDR: {One-line title}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}

## Rules

- **Brevity over completeness** — if it takes more than 2 minutes to read, it's too long
- **Specifics over generalities** — include actual file names, numbers, error messages, not vague descriptions
- **Skip sections with no content** — if no decisions were made, omit the Decisions table
- **No jargon expansion** — engineers reading this know the stack; don't explain what Oban or Ecto are
- **One file, flat structure** — no subdirectories, no companion files
- Write to `./.stoobz/TLDR.md` in the current working directory unless the user specifies a different path
