This skill automates the maintenance of a `CHANGELOG.md` file by adding changes **before** they are committed. It groups changes by date and uses emojis to represent different commit types, following a premium visual style.

## Key Features

- **Date Grouping**: Automatically groups entries under `## [YYYY-MM-DD]` headers.
- **Emoji Support**: Maps conventional commit types to corresponding emojis (e.g., ✨ for `feat`, 🐛 for `fix`, ♻️ for `refactor`).
- **Detailed Entries**: Supports multi-line commit messages, using the body as the entry description.

## Workflow

To ensure the `CHANGELOG.md` is included in the same commit as your changes, follow these steps:

### 1. Stage your changes

Stage the files you want to commit.

### 2. Determine your commit message

Construct a full conventional commit message with a detailed body (required for `commiter` skill).

### 3. Update the Changelog (PRE-COMMIT)

Run the script passing your intended full commit message as an argument:

```bash
py .agents/skills/changelogger/scripts/update_changelog.py "feat: Added premium styling

Implemented a new design system for the CHANGELOG.md. It now uses date headers, emojis for commit types, and supports detailed descriptions for each entry."
```

### 4. Stage and Review

The script updates `CHANGELOG.md`. You must now stage the changelog as well:

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md
```

### 5. Finalize the Commit

Commit all staged changes using the EXACT same message.
