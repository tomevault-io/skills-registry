# Claude Code Plugin Development Skill

Expert knowledge for building Claude Code plugins with up-to-date 2025 standards.

## When Claude Should Use This Skill

Activate this skill automatically when the user:
- Asks to create/build a Claude Code plugin
- Wants to write slash commands or Agent Skills
- Needs to implement MCP servers or custom tools
- Wants to configure hooks or event handlers
- Asks about plugin architecture or structure
- Needs help with plugin.json manifest
- Wants to publish to a marketplace
- Asks about debugging plugin components
- Mentions keywords: plugin, skill, command, MCP, hook, marketplace, subagent

## Quick Overview

Claude Code plugins consist of **five component types** that extend functionality:

1. **Slash Commands** - User-triggered shortcuts (`/command`)
2. **Agent Skills** - Model-invoked capabilities (auto-activated)
3. **Subagents** - Specialized task handlers
4. **MCP Servers** - External tool/data integrations
5. **Hooks** - Event-driven automations

## Documentation Structure

This skill is organized into focused modules for easy reference:

### Core References

- **[Plugin Structure](reference/plugin-structure.md)** - Architecture, file organization, component types, scope hierarchy
- **[Plugin Manifest](reference/plugin-manifest.md)** - plugin.json schema, validation, configuration
- **[Slash Commands](reference/slash-commands.md)** - Command creation, arguments, tool permissions, namespacing
- **[Agent Skills](reference/agent-skills.md)** - 2025 schema, activation patterns, descriptions that work
- **[MCP Servers](reference/mcp-servers.md)** - Custom tools, TypeScript/Python implementations, tool naming
- **[Hooks](reference/hooks.md)** - Event handlers, available events, matchers, environment variables

### Practical Guides

- **[Development Workflow](guides/development-workflow.md)** - Local testing, debugging, validation checklist
- **[Publishing & Distribution](guides/publishing.md)** - GitHub setup, versioning, marketplace creation
- **[Best Practices](guides/best-practices.md)** - Security, performance, maintainability, design principles

### Examples & Troubleshooting

- **[Complete Plugin Examples](examples/complete-plugins.md)** - Full working examples for common use cases
- **[Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions

## Getting Started

### For First-Time Plugin Creators

1. Read **[Plugin Structure](reference/plugin-structure.md)** to understand architecture
2. Create **[Plugin Manifest](reference/plugin-manifest.md)** (required `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`)
3. Choose component type(s) to implement:
   - Commands? → See **[Slash Commands](reference/slash-commands.md)**
   - Skills? → See **[Agent Skills](reference/agent-skills.md)**
   - Tools? → See **[MCP Servers](reference/mcp-servers.md)**
   - Automation? → See **[Hooks](reference/hooks.md)**
4. Follow **[Development Workflow](guides/development-workflow.md)** for local testing
5. Use **[Publishing Guide](guides/publishing.md)** to distribute

### For Specific Tasks

**"I want to create a slash command"**
→ See [Slash Commands](reference/slash-commands.md)

**"How do I make a skill that auto-activates?"**
→ See [Agent Skills](reference/agent-skills.md) - especially the "Activation Patterns" section

**"I need to build custom tools/MCP server"**
→ See [MCP Servers](reference/mcp-servers.md)

**"How do I auto-format code after edits?"**
→ See [Hooks](reference/hooks.md) - PostToolUse event

**"My skill isn't activating"**
→ See [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) - "Skills Not Activating" section

**"What are the best practices?"**
→ See [Best Practices](guides/best-practices.md)

## Quick Reference

### Minimal Plugin Structure

```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json              # REQUIRED
├── commands/                    # Optional
│   └── my-command.md
├── skills/                      # Optional
│   └── my-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── mcp/                         # Optional
│   └── server.ts
└── README.md
```

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Local testing
/plugin marketplace add ~/.claude/marketplaces/local
/plugin install my-plugin

# Management
/plugin list
/plugin update my-plugin
/help | grep my-command

# Validation
jq . .claude-plugin/plugin.json
```

### Key 2025 Updates

- ✅ `allowed-tools` field for tool permissions in skills
- ✅ Version tracking required
- ✅ Enhanced activation triggers with specific keywords
- ✅ 240+ community plugins available

## When to Reference Each Module

| User Question | Read This |
|--------------|-----------|
| "How do I structure a plugin?" | [Plugin Structure](reference/plugin-structure.md) |
| "What goes in plugin.json?" | [Plugin Manifest](reference/plugin-manifest.md) |
| "Create a command that..." | [Slash Commands](reference/slash-commands.md) |
| "Build a skill that activates when..." | [Agent Skills](reference/agent-skills.md) |
| "Implement custom tools/API integration" | [MCP Servers](reference/mcp-servers.md) |
| "Auto-run something after tool use" | [Hooks](reference/hooks.md) |
| "How do I test locally?" | [Development Workflow](guides/development-workflow.md) |
| "How do I publish my plugin?" | [Publishing](guides/publishing.md) |
| "My plugin component isn't working" | [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) |
| "Show me a complete example" | [Examples](examples/complete-plugins.md) |

## Important Notes

- **2025 Schema**: All documentation follows the latest 2025 plugin schema
- **Activation Keywords**: Skill descriptions must be specific with file types, actions, and tools
- **Tool Permissions**: Use `allowed-tools` to restrict access appropriately
- **Testing First**: Always test locally before publishing
- **No Secrets**: Never commit API keys or credentials
