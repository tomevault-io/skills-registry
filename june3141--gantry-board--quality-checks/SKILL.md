# Quality Checks

## Commands

| Check | Command | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| Format (fix) | `task fmt` | After writing code |
| Format (check) | `task fmt:check` | CI / verify only |
| Lint | `task lint` | After completing a feature |
| Build | `task build` | Before commit |
| Test | `task test` | After implementation passes lint |
| Full check | `task check` | Before commit (auto by L3 hook) |
| API export | `task api:export` | After modifying utoipa annotations |
| API generate | `task api:generate` | After OpenAPI spec changes |
| API diff | `task api:diff` | CI — verify generated code is up to date |
| Security audit | `task audit` | Before release / periodic |
| Coverage | `task coverage` | After major changes |
| Dep health | `task deps:check` | Periodic maintenance |

## Layer-specific Commands

| Layer | Format | Lint | Build | Test |
|-------|--------|------|-------|------|
| Backend | `task backend:fmt` | `task backend:lint` | `task backend:build` | `task backend:test` |
| Frontend | `task frontend:fmt` | `task frontend:lint` | `task frontend:build` | `task frontend:test` |

## Security & Maintenance Commands

| Check | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| cargo-deny | `task backend:deny` | Advisories, licenses, bans, sources |
| npm audit | `task frontend:audit` | Frontend dependency vulnerabilities |
| Security (all) | `task audit` | Both backend + frontend security |
| Backend coverage | `task backend:coverage` | HTML report (opens in browser) |
| Backend coverage (CI) | `task backend:coverage:lcov` | lcov output for CI |
| Frontend coverage | `task frontend:coverage` | Vitest with v8 coverage |
| Coverage (all) | `task coverage` | Both backend + frontend coverage |
| Outdated deps | `task backend:outdated` | Check for outdated Rust deps |
| Unused deps | `task backend:machete` | Detect unused Rust deps |
| Dep health (all) | `task deps:check` | Outdated + unused check |

## Automated Hooks

Quality is enforced automatically via 3 layers of Claude Code hooks:

- **L1 (PostToolUse)**: Auto-formats files after every Write/Edit (`cargo fmt` / `biome format --write`)
- **L2 (Stop)**: Runs lint on modified layers when Claude completes a response
- **L3 (PreToolUse)**: Blocks `git commit` unless commit message format, commit size, and `task check` all pass
