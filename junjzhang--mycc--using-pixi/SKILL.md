description: Guidance for developing under a projects managed by pixi. Always use when workspace managed by pixi (have pixi.toml or pixi.lock in root directory.) Covers all you should know while developing under a pixi-based project: pixi environment commands (install, run, shell, add, task), multi-environment management (-e flag, features), task configuration in pixi.toml, dependencies (conda vs PyPI), lock files, and development workflows. Helps with environment setup, package management, running tasks, debugging pixi.toml errors, and production deployment patterns. Use when this capability is needed.

# Pixi Helper

Expert guidance for using Pixi, a fast conda-based package manager for Python projects.

## Purpose

Help developers effectively use Pixi for managing conda/PyPI dependencies, running commands in isolated environments, and configuring multi-environment projects.

## When to Use

- Working with `pixi.toml` or `pixi.lock` files
- Installing or managing packages
- Running commands or tasks in pixi environments
- Setting up development/production environments
- Debugging pixi configuration errors

---

## Quick Command Reference

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Initialize & install
pixi init [project-name]
pixi install                         # install default environment
pixi install -e dev                  # install dev environment

# Add dependencies
pixi add python=3.11 pytorch pandas  # conda packages
pixi add --pypi transformers         # PyPI packages
pixi add --feature dev pytest ruff   # to dev feature

# Run commands
pixi run python script.py            # use default env
pixi run -e dev pytest               # use dev env
pixi shell                           # interactive shell
pixi shell -e dev                    # dev shell

# Tasks
pixi task add lint "ruff check ."
pixi task list
pixi run lint

# Production
pixi run --frozen --no-install train.py
```

### Key Flags

- `-e <env>`: Use specific environment
- `--frozen`: Don't update lock file (reproducible)
- `--no-install`: Skip installation
- `--feature <name>`: Target specific feature

---

## Core Concepts

### Workspace
Directory with:
- `pixi.toml`: Configuration (commit this)
- `pixi.lock`: Lock file (commit this)
- `.pixi/`: Environment cache (DON'T commit)

### Environments
Named dependency sets. Use `-e` flag to select:

```bash
pixi run python script.py       # default
pixi run -e dev pytest           # dev
pixi run -e prod train.py        # prod
```

### Features
Reusable dependency groups that compose into environments.

### Tasks
Predefined commands in pixi.toml. Run with `pixi run <task-name>`.

---

## Command Patterns

### When to Use What

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| First-time setup | `pixi install` |
| Add package | `pixi add <pkg>` |
| Run one command | `pixi run <cmd>` |
| Interactive work | `pixi shell` |
| Execute task | `pixi run <task>` |
| Production | `pixi run --frozen --no-install` |

### Adding Dependencies

**Prefer conda first** (better compatibility, faster):
```bash
pixi add numpy pytorch
```

**Use PyPI when needed**:
```bash
pixi add --pypi transformers
```

**Why conda first?** Pixi resolves conda deps first, then PyPI.

## pixi.toml Configuration

### Project Metadata

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
channels = ["conda-forge", "pytorch"]  # order matters
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64"]
```

### Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
python = ">=3.10"
numpy = "*"
pytorch = ">=2.0,<3"

[pypi-dependencies]
transformers = "*"
my-pkg = { path = "./local", editable = true }
```

### Tasks

**Simple**:
```toml
[tasks]
test = "pytest tests/"
```

**With environment variables**:
```toml
[tasks.train]
cmd = "python train.py"
env = { CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES = "0,1" }
```

**With dependencies**:
```toml
[tasks]
clean = "rm -rf __pycache__"
test = { cmd = "pytest", depends-on = ["clean"] }
```

**Multi-line**:
```toml
[tasks.submit]
cmd = """
python train.py \
  --config config.yaml \
  --output results/
"""
```

### Features

```toml
[feature.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "*"
ruff = "*"

[feature.cuda.dependencies]
pytorch-cuda = "12.1"

[environments]
default = []
dev = ["dev"]
gpu = ["cuda"]
dev-gpu = ["dev", "cuda"]
```

### Activation Environment

```toml
[activation.env]
CUDA_HOME = "/usr/local/cuda"
PROJECT_ROOT = "$PIXI_PROJECT_ROOT"
```

---

## Common Workflows

### Your Patterns (susser-tod)

**Dev testing**:
```bash
pixi run -e dev pytest ./tests
```

**Type checking**:
```bash
pixi run typecheck
```

**Profiling**:
```bash
pixi run -e dev nsys profile python train.py
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Package Not Found

**Checks**:
1. Channel specified in `channels = [...]`?
2. Package name correct? Try: `pixi search <pkg>`
3. Try PyPI: `pixi add --pypi <pkg>`

### 2. Environment Not Activated

❌ **Wrong**: `python script.py` (bare python)
✅ **Correct**: `pixi run python script.py`

### 4. Lock File Conflicts

After merge conflicts:
```bash
pixi install              # regenerate lock
# or
rm pixi.lock && pixi install
```

### 5. Environment Variables Not Set

Variables from `[activation.env]` only work with:
- `pixi run <cmd>`
- Inside `pixi shell`

NOT with bare `python` outside pixi.

### 6. Dependency Version Conflicts

Use `solve-group` to isolate environments:

```toml
[environments]
default = { solve-group = "group1" }
dev = { features = ["dev"], solve-group = "group1" }  # shared
prod = { solve-group = "group2" }                     # isolated
```

---

## Best Practices

### Dependencies
✅ Conda first, PyPI when needed
✅ Pin critical versions: `pytorch = "2.1.*"`
✅ Version constraints: `python = ">=3.10,<3.12"`
❌ Don't mix conda + PyPI for same package

### Lock Files
✅ Commit `pixi.lock`
✅ Use `--frozen` in CI/production

### Environments
✅ Use features to organize deps
✅ Share solve-groups when possible
✅ 2-4 environments is ideal
