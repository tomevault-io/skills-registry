# Website Audit Skill

This skill provides a complete auditing toolkit for the JupitLunar website. It combines internal unit tests with a dynamic crawler to ensure the site is healthy, performant, and error-free.

## Capabilities

1.  **Dynamic Crawler (`audit-scout.js`)**:
    *   🕷️ **Link Checking**: Crawls the entire site to find broken internal and external links.
    *   🚨 **Error Detection**: Captures runtime console errors and unhandled exceptions on every page.
    *   🖼️ **Asset Validation**: Checks for missing images and broken media.
    *   ⚡ **Performance**: specific page load checks.

2.  **System Health Suite (Existing Tests)**:
    *   Utilization of the robust `npm run test:all` suite covering SEO, API, Admin, and Search.

## How to Use

### 1. The Full "Deep" Audit

This is the recommended command for a complete checkup. It runs the system tests AND the dynamic crawler.

**Prerequisite**: Ensure the local development server is running on `http://localhost:3001`.

```bash
# Start the server in a separate terminal if not running
# npm run dev -- -p 3001

# Run the full audit
cd nextjs-project
node ../.agent/skills/website-audit/scripts/audit-scout.js
```

### 2. Audit specific features

If you only want to check specific aspects:

**Check SEO Rules:**
```bash
node scripts/test-seo.js
```

**Check API Endpoints:**
```bash
node scripts/test-api.js
```

**Check Analytics:**
```bash
node scripts/test-analytics.js
```

### 3. Browser Verification (Final Step)

After automated tools accept the build, use the `browser_subagent` to perform a "sanity check" that mimics real user behavior. Automated crawlers can miss visual bugs or interaction issues.

**Instructions for the Agent:**

1.  **Launch Browser**: Open `http://localhost:3001`.
2.  **Navigation Check**: Click through the main navigation menu items (Home, Features, Pricing, About, etc.) to ensure pages render visually correct.
3.  **Interaction Check**:
    -   Click a few "Call to Action" buttons.
    -   Test a simple form (e.g., newsletter signup) if safe/idempotent.
    -   Verify that no "Application Error" overlays appear.
4.  **Visual Confirmation**: Take a screenshot if something looks suspicious.

## Interpreting Results

The `audit-scout.js` will generate a report in the console (and optionally a JSON file).

- **🔴 CRITICAL**: 404s on internal pages, 500 API errors, React hydration errors.
- **🟡 WARNING**: Slow page loads, missing alt text, non-critical console warnings.
- **🟢 PASS**: All checks passed.
