# Reddit Fetch via Gemini CLI

When WebFetch fails to access Reddit (blocked, 403, etc.), use Gemini CLI 

Pick a unique session name (e.g., `gemini_abc123`) and use it consistently throughout.

## Setup


## How to tell if Enter was sent

Look for YOUR QUERY TEXT specifically. Is it inside or outside the bordered box?

**Enter NOT sent** - your query is INSIDE the box:
```
╭─────────────────────────────────────╮
│ > Your actual query text here       │
╰─────────────────────────────────────╯
```

**Enter WAS sent** - your query is OUTSIDE the box, followed by activity:
```
> Your actual query text here

⠋ Our hamsters are working... (processing)

╭────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ >   Type your message or @path/to/file     │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Note: The empty prompt `Type your message or @path/to/file` always appears in the box - that's normal. What matters is whether YOUR query text is inside or outside the box.

If your query is inside the box, run `tmux send-keys -t <session_name> Enter` to submit.
