# Firebase App Hosting Configuration Guide

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for working with Firebase App Hosting - a modern hosting solution for dynamic web apps with built-in GitHub integration, Cloud Run backend, and Cloud CDN caching.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Setting up or configuring `apphosting.yaml` for the first time
- Debugging build or deployment failures
- Encountering errors that work in dev but fail in production
- Configuring environment variables and secrets
- Adjusting Cloud Run service settings (CPU, memory, concurrency)
- Converting dependencies between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`
- Optimizing app for App Hosting production environment

## Quick Start Checklist

Before deploying to Firebase App Hosting:

1. **Project Requirements**
   - Firebase project with Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan
   - GitHub repository connected to Firebase
   - Next.js 13.5.x+ or Angular 18.2.x+ (or community-supported framework)
   - Next.js 15.x is now in active support (as of 2025)
   - Node.js 20+

2. **Essential Files**
   - `apphosting.yaml` in project root
   - `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml` (lock file required)
   - Valid `package.json` with correct dependency classifications

3. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Initialize apphosting.yaml
   firebase init apphosting
   
   # Create backend
   firebase apphosting:backends:create --project PROJECT_ID
   ```

## Core Configuration Workflow

### Step 1: Create apphosting.yaml

Start with the basic structure. See `assets/apphosting.yaml.template` for a complete working example.

**Minimal configuration:**
```yaml
runConfig:
  cpu: 1
  memoryMiB: 512
  minInstances: 0
  maxInstances: 10

env:
  - variable: NODE_ENV
    value: production
```

**Key sections:**
- `runConfig` - Cloud Run service settings (CPU, memory, scaling)
- `env` - Environment variables and secrets
- `scripts` - Optional build/run command overrides
- `outputFiles` - Optional deploy optimization

For detailed configuration options, see `references/apphosting-yaml-reference.md`.

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

**Rules for environment variables:**

1. **Build-time vs Runtime availability:**
   ```yaml
   env:
     # Available in both build and runtime (default)
     - variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
       value: https://api.example.com
     
     # Build-time only
     - variable: NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED
       value: "1"
       availability:
         - BUILD
     
     # Runtime only (server-side secrets)
     - variable: DATABASE_URL
       secret: database-url-secret
       availability:
         - RUNTIME
   ```

2. **Next.js public variables:**
   - Prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for browser access
   - These must be available at BUILD time to be embedded

3. **Secrets management:**
   - Store sensitive data in Cloud Secret Manager
   - Reference secrets in apphosting.yaml (safe for source control)
   - Never set secrets with BUILD availability - this can cause runtime initialization errors

**Common mistake to avoid:**
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - Admin SDK credentials at BUILD time causes errors
- variable: FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
  value: "..."
  availability:
    - BUILD
    - RUNTIME

# ✅ CORRECT - Admin SDK credentials at RUNTIME only
- variable: FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
  value: "..."
  availability:
    - RUNTIME
```

### Step 3: Validate package.json Dependencies

**Critical distinction:**
- `dependencies` - Required at runtime in production
- `devDependencies` - Only needed during development/build

**Common issues:**

1. **Build tools in wrong section:**
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "next": "15.5.6",        // ✅ Needed at runtime
       "react": "^19",          // ✅ Needed at runtime
       "typescript": "^5"       // ❌ Should be devDependency
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       "@types/node": "^20",    // ✅ Build-time only
       "eslint": "^9"           // ✅ Build-time only
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Missing runtime dependencies:**
   If a package is used in production code, it must be in `dependencies`:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "firebase-admin": "^12",     // ✅ Used in API routes
       "stripe": "^14"              // ✅ Used server-side
     }
   }
   ```

For detailed guidance, see `references/package-json-guide.md`.

### Step 4: Deploy and Monitor

```bash
# Push to live branch triggers automatic deployment
git push origin main

# Or manually create rollout
firebase apphosting:rollouts:create BACKEND_ID --project PROJECT_ID

# Monitor deployment
firebase apphosting:backends:get BACKEND_ID --project PROJECT_ID
```

## Common Production Issues

### Issue 1: "Module not found" in Production

**Symptom:** Works locally, fails in App Hosting with module import errors.

**Causes:**
1. Package in `devDependencies` but needed at runtime
2. Missing lock file
3. Case-sensitive imports (Linux production vs case-insensitive dev)

**Solution:**
1. Move package to `dependencies`
2. Ensure lock file exists and is committed
3. Check import statement casing matches actual file names

### Issue 2: Environment Variable Not Available

**Symptom:** `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` is undefined in production.

**Causes:**
1. Variable not in `apphosting.yaml`
2. Wrong `availability` setting
3. Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side variables

**Solution:**
1. Add to `apphosting.yaml` env section
2. Set correct availability (BUILD, RUNTIME, or both)
3. Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for browser-accessible variables

### Issue 3: Firebase Admin SDK Initialization Error

**Symptom:** "Neither apiKey nor config.authenticator" error.

**Cause:** Admin SDK credentials available at BUILD time.

**Solution:** Set credentials to RUNTIME only:
```yaml
env:
  - variable: FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
    value: "..."
    availability:
      - RUNTIME
  
  - variable: FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
    value: "..."
    availability:
      - RUNTIME
```

### Issue 4: Build Succeeds but Deploy Fails

**Symptom:** Cloud Build completes, but Cloud Run deployment fails.

**Common causes:**
1. Port binding issues (App Hosting manages PORT automatically)
2. Health check failures
3. Memory/CPU limits too low

**Solution:**
1. Don't override PORT in your app
2. Increase `memoryMiB` and/or `cpu` in runConfig
3. Check Cloud Run logs for specific errors

For comprehensive troubleshooting, see `references/common-errors.md`.

## Framework-Specific Guidance

### Next.js Configuration

See `references/nextjs-specific.md` for detailed Next.js guidance including:
- Image optimization setup
- Middleware caching considerations
- Server actions configuration
- Parallel routing limitations

**Key Next.js tips:**
1. Use App Router (recommended) or Pages Router
2. Don't override default build command unless necessary
3. Image optimization requires explicit configuration
4. Middleware may affect caching

### Angular Configuration

- Angular 18.2.x+ supported
- Use Application builder
- SSR pages work with proper configuration
- Limited i18n support (check limitations)

## Advanced Configuration

### Cloud Run Service Tuning

Adjust performance and cost with `runConfig`:

```yaml
runConfig:
  # Processing power
  cpu: 2                    # 0-8 CPUs
  memoryMiB: 2048          # 128-32768 MiB
  
  # Scaling behavior
  minInstances: 0          # Minimum always-on instances
  maxInstances: 100        # Maximum instances
  concurrency: 80          # Requests per instance
```

**Memory/CPU relationship:**
- **1 vCPU**: Up to 4 GiB (4096 MiB)
- **2 vCPU**: Up to 8 GiB (8192 MiB)
- **4 vCPU**: 2 GiB to 16 GiB (minimum 2 GiB required)
- **6 vCPU**: 4 GiB to 24 GiB (minimum 4 GiB required)
- **8 vCPU**: 4 GiB to 32 GiB (minimum 4 GiB required)

**Important:** Higher memory allocations require higher CPU counts:
- Over 4 GiB → requires 2+ vCPUs
- Over 8 GiB → requires 4+ vCPUs
- Over 16 GiB → requires 6+ vCPUs
- Over 24 GiB → requires 8 vCPUs

### VPC Network Access

Connect to private resources:

```yaml
runConfig:
  vpcAccess:
    egress: PRIVATE_RANGES_ONLY
    networkInterfaces:
      - network: my-network-id
        subnetwork: my-subnetwork-id
```

### Build Command Override

Only override if framework adapters don't work:

```yaml
scripts:
  buildCommand: next build --no-lint
  runCommand: node dist/index.js
```

**Warning:** Overriding disables framework-specific optimizations.

## Best Practices

1. **Start minimal** - Begin with basic config, add complexity as needed
2. **Test locally** - Use App Hosting emulator before deploying
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start --only apphosting
   # Uses apphosting.emulator.yaml for local overrides
   # Your app runs with same environment variables as production
   ```
3. **Version control** - Commit apphosting.yaml (safe with secrets as references)
4. **Monitor builds** - Check Firebase console for build/deploy status
5. **Iterate carefully** - Make one change at a time when debugging
6. **Use secrets** - Store sensitive data in Cloud Secret Manager
7. **Review dependencies** - Ensure correct classification in package.json
8. **Check lock files** - Always commit your package manager's lock file
