# Data Engineering: Data Quality

Comprehensive data quality validation, monitoring, and observability patterns for production data pipelines.

## Core Principles

1. **Validate early, validate often** -- Catch data issues at ingestion before they propagate downstream. Every pipeline stage should have quality gates.
2. **Schema contracts are APIs** -- Treat your data schemas as versioned contracts between producers and consumers. Breaking changes require coordination.
3. **Measure the six dimensions** -- Track completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, and validity as quantifiable metrics with thresholds.
4. **Observability over monitoring** -- Move beyond threshold alerts to understanding data behavior through freshness, volume, schema, and lineage tracking.
5. **Quality is a pipeline, not a step** -- Data quality is not a single validation checkpoint; it is a continuous process woven into every stage of your data lifecycle.

## Great Expectations Fundamentals

Define expectations as declarative rules, organize them into suites, and run checkpoints in your pipeline.

```python
import great_expectations as gx

context = gx.get_context()
ds = context.data_sources.add_pandas("customer_source")
asset = ds.add_dataframe_asset(name="customers")
batch_def = asset.add_batch_definition_whole_dataframe("full_batch")

suite = context.suites.add(gx.ExpectationSuite(name="customer_ingestion_suite"))
suite.add_expectation(gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull(column="customer_id"))
suite.add_expectation(gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToBeUnique(column="customer_id"))
suite.add_expectation(gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToMatchRegex(
    column="email", regex=r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$"
))
suite.add_expectation(gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween(
    column="account_balance", min_value=0, max_value=10_000_000
))

val_def = context.validation_definitions.add(
    gx.ValidationDefinition(name="customer_validation", data=batch_def, suite=suite)
)
checkpoint = context.checkpoints.add(
    gx.Checkpoint(name="customer_checkpoint", validation_definitions=[val_def])
)
result = checkpoint.run()
if not result.success:
    raise ValueError(f"Quality failed: {sum(1 for r in result.run_results.values() if not r.success)} checks")
```

- Multi-datasource checkpoint orchestration
- Conditional and parameterized expectations

## Soda Core Checks

Define data quality checks in YAML and run them with Soda Core for lightweight, configuration-driven validation.

```yaml
checks for customers:
  - row_count > 0
  - missing_count(customer_id) = 0
  - duplicate_count(customer_id) = 0
  - invalid_count(email) = 0:
      valid regex: "^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$"
  - freshness(updated_at) < 2d
  - schema:
      fail:
        when required column missing: [customer_id, email, created_at]
        when wrong type:
          customer_id: integer
  - anomaly detection for row_count:
      warn: only
```

- Anomaly detection configuration
- Cross-dataset reference checks
- Soda Cloud integration and alerting

## Schema Contracts and Evolution

Enforce schema contracts at pipeline boundaries to prevent breaking changes from propagating silently.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum

class Compat(Enum):
    BACKWARD = "backward"   # New schema can read old data
    FORWARD = "forward"     # Old schema can read new data
    FULL = "full"           # Both directions

@dataclass
class SchemaContract:
    name: str
    version: int
    required_columns: dict[str, str]    # column_name -> data_type
    optional_columns: dict[str, str]
    compatibility: Compat

    def validate_dataframe(self, df) -> list[str]:
        violations = []
        for col, dtype in self.required_columns.items():
            if col not in df.columns:
                violations.append(f"Missing required column: {col}")
            elif str(df[col].dtype) != dtype:
                violations.append(f"Column {col}: expected {dtype}, got {df[col].dtype}")
        return violations

    def check_evolution(self, new_contract: "SchemaContract") -> list[str]:
        issues = []
        removed = set(self.required_columns) - set(new_contract.required_columns)
        if removed and self.compatibility in (Compat.FORWARD, Compat.FULL):
            issues.append(f"Removing columns breaks forward compat: {removed}")
        added = set(new_contract.required_columns) - set(self.required_columns)
        if added and self.compatibility in (Compat.BACKWARD, Compat.FULL):
            issues.append(f"Adding required columns breaks backward compat: {added}")
        return issues
```

## Anomaly Detection Patterns

Detect unexpected changes in data volume, distributions, and value ranges using statistical methods.

```python
import numpy as np

class VolumeAnomalyDetector:
    def __init__(self, z_threshold: float = 3.0):
        self.z_threshold = z_threshold

    def check(self, current: int, history: list[int]) -> dict:
        if len(history) < 7:
            return {"is_anomaly": False, "reason": "insufficient_history"}
        mean, std = np.mean(history), np.std(history)
        if std == 0:
            return {"is_anomaly": current != mean}
        z = (current - mean) / std
        return {"is_anomaly": abs(z) > self.z_threshold, "z_score": round(z, 3),
                "expected_range": (round(mean - self.z_threshold * std), round(mean + self.z_threshold * std))}
```

- Alert fatigue reduction strategies

## Data Observability

Track freshness, volume, schema changes, and lineage across your entire data platform.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from enum import Enum

class Status(Enum):
    HEALTHY = "healthy"
    WARNING = "warning"
    CRITICAL = "critical"

@dataclass
class TableHealthCheck:
    table_name: str
    freshness_threshold: timedelta
    expected_schema: dict[str, str]

    def check_freshness(self, last_updated: datetime) -> Status:
        age = datetime.utcnow() - last_updated
        if age > self.freshness_threshold * 2:
            return Status.CRITICAL
        return Status.WARNING if age > self.freshness_threshold else Status.HEALTHY

    def check_schema(self, actual: dict[str, str]) -> tuple[Status, list[str]]:
        diffs = [f"Missing: {c}" for c in self.expected_schema if c not in actual]
        diffs += [f"{c}: expected {t}, got {actual[c]}"
                  for c, t in self.expected_schema.items()
                  if c in actual and actual[c] != t]
        status = Status.CRITICAL if any("Missing" in d for d in diffs) \
            else Status.WARNING if diffs else Status.HEALTHY
        return status, diffs
```

## Quality Metrics and SLAs

Define measurable quality dimensions and enforce them through SLAs with automated scoring.

```python
@dataclass
class QualityDimension:
    name: str                       # "completeness", "accuracy", "timeliness"
    weight: float                   # weights must sum to 1.0
    threshold_warn: float
    threshold_fail: float
    current_score: float = 0.0

def composite_score(dims: list[QualityDimension]) -> dict:
    score = sum(d.current_score * d.weight for d in dims)
    fails = [d.name for d in dims if d.current_score < d.threshold_fail]
    warns = [d.name for d in dims if d.threshold_fail <= d.current_score < d.threshold_warn]
    return {"score": round(score, 4), "status": "fail" if fails else "warn" if warns else "pass"}
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| Validating only at pipeline end | Quality gates at each stage (ingestion, transform, load) |
| Hardcoded thresholds without history | Adaptive thresholds from rolling statistics |
| Silent failures writing bad data downstream | Fail-fast with circuit breakers and dead-letter queues |
| Schema-on-read with no contracts | Explicit schema contracts between producers and consumers |
| Single global quality score | Per-dimension scores with independent thresholds |
| Manual checks after incidents | Automated continuous validation in pipelines |
| Alerting on every anomaly | Tiered alerting (info/warn/critical) with escalation policies |
| Testing quality only in production | Contract tests in CI/CD before deployment |

## Performance

- **Sample large datasets** -- Use `TABLESAMPLE` or partition-level checks on multi-billion row tables.
- **Parallelize checks** -- Run column-level expectations concurrently; Soda checks are independent by default.
- **Partition-aware validation** -- Only validate changed partitions, not the entire table.
- **Cache historical metrics** -- Store rolling statistics in a metrics table rather than recomputing each run.
- **Approximate aggregations** -- HyperLogLog for cardinality, t-digest for percentiles on terabyte tables.
- **Schedule strategically** -- Freshness/volume every 15 min; distribution checks daily off-peak.
