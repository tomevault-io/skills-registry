# Git Advanced Operations

Power-user Git workflows for rewriting history, recovery, automation, and large repo management.

## Core Principles

1. **Understand the object model** - Commits are immutable snapshots; branches are movable pointers; HEAD tracks your current position
2. **Reflog is your safety net** - Every HEAD movement is recorded for 90 days; almost nothing in Git is truly lost
3. **Non-destructive by default** - Prefer operations that create new commits over those that destroy history
4. **Never rewrite shared history** - Only rebase or amend commits that have not been pushed to a shared branch
5. **Automate repetitive checks** - Use hooks to enforce standards before code leaves your machine

## Interactive Rebase

**Rewrite, reorder, squash, and clean up commit history before sharing**

```bash
# Rebase last 5 commits interactively
git rebase -i HEAD~5

# In the editor, change pick to the desired action:
# pick   abc1234 Add user model
# squash abc1235 Fix typo in user model
# reword abc1236 Add auth middleware
# edit   abc1237 Add login endpoint
# drop   abc1238 WIP debugging

# Autosquash: auto-arrange fixup/squash commits
git commit --fixup=abc1234
git rebase -i --autosquash HEAD~5

# Rebase onto a different base branch
git rebase --onto main feature-base feature-branch
```

See [interactive-rebase.md](references/interactive-rebase.md) for:
- Squash vs fixup vs reword workflows
- Edit mode for splitting commits
- Autosquash with `--fixup` and `--squash` commits
- Rebase onto for transplanting branches
- Handling rebase conflicts

## Reflog and Recovery

**Recover lost commits and undo destructive operations**

```bash
# View recent HEAD movements
git reflog --date=relative

# Recover a commit after accidental reset
git reflog
# abc1234 HEAD@{2}: commit: important work
git checkout -b recovery-branch abc1234

# Undo a rebase by resetting to pre-rebase state
git reflog
# abc1234 HEAD@{5}: rebase (start): checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD@{5}

# Recover a deleted branch
git reflog | grep "checkout: moving from deleted-branch"
git checkout -b restored-branch abc1234
```

See [reflog-recovery.md](references/reflog-recovery.md) for:
- Reflog navigation and time-based references
- Recovering commits after reset, rebase, or amend
- Restoring deleted branches and stashes
- Using `git fsck` for dangling objects

## Git Hooks

**Automate checks and enforce standards at key Git events**

```bash
# Pre-commit hook: lint and format before committing
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'HOOK'
#!/bin/sh
# Run linter on staged files only
STAGED_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '\.py$')
if [ -n "$STAGED_FILES" ]; then
    ruff check $STAGED_FILES || exit 1
    ruff format --check $STAGED_FILES || exit 1
fi
HOOK
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Commit-msg hook: enforce conventional commit format
cat > .git/hooks/commit-msg << 'HOOK'
#!/bin/sh
PATTERN='^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .{1,72}$'
if ! head -1 "$1" | grep -qE "$PATTERN"; then
    echo "ERROR: Commit message must follow Conventional Commits format"
    echo "Example: feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow"
    exit 1
fi
HOOK
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

See [git-hooks.md](references/git-hooks.md) for:
- Pre-push hooks for test enforcement
- Husky and lint-staged setup for team projects
- Sharing hooks via a committed `.githooks/` directory
- All available hook types and their arguments

## Worktrees

**Work on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing or cloning**

```bash
# Create a worktree for reviewing a PR
git worktree add ../review-pr-42 pr-42-feature

# Create a worktree with a new branch
git worktree add -b hotfix/login-bug ../hotfix main

# List active worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree when done
git worktree remove ../review-pr-42

# Prune stale worktree references
git worktree prune
```

See [worktree-patterns.md](references/worktree-patterns.md) for:
- PR review workflow with worktrees
- Parallel development across features
- Worktree cleanup and maintenance
- Bare repo with worktree-only workflow

## Stash Management

**Save and restore work-in-progress without committing**

```bash
# Stash with a descriptive message
git stash push -m "WIP: refactoring auth middleware"

# Stash only specific files
git stash push -m "partial save" -- src/auth.py src/config.py

# Stash including untracked files
git stash push --include-untracked -m "with new files"

# List stashes and inspect contents
git stash list
git stash show -p stash@{0}

# Apply without removing from stash stack
git stash apply stash@{1}

# Create a branch from a stash
git stash branch new-feature stash@{0}
```

See [stash-lfs-patterns.md](references/stash-lfs-patterns.md) for:
- Partial stash with `--patch`
- Recovering dropped stashes from reflog
- Stash-based workflow patterns

## Git LFS

**Track large binary files without bloating the repository**

```bash
# Install and initialize LFS
git lfs install

# Track file patterns
git lfs track "*.psd" "*.zip" "datasets/*.parquet"

# Verify tracked patterns
cat .gitattributes

# Check LFS status
git lfs status
git lfs ls-files

# Migrate existing large files to LFS
git lfs migrate import --include="*.bin" --everything
```

See [stash-lfs-patterns.md](references/stash-lfs-patterns.md) for:
- LFS setup and migration workflow
- Handling LFS in CI/CD
- Storage and bandwidth considerations

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| `git push --force` on shared branches | `git push --force-with-lease` to prevent overwriting others' work |
| Rebasing commits already pushed to shared branches | Merge or revert to preserve shared history |
| Giant squash of entire feature branch | Squash related commits into logical units |
| Stashing without messages | `git stash push -m "description"` for identifiable stashes |
| Committing large binaries directly | Git LFS for files over 1 MB |
| Copy-pasting hook scripts between repos | Husky + lint-staged or a shared `.githooks/` directory |
| `git checkout` for everything | `git switch` for branches, `git restore` for files |
| `git reset --hard` without checking reflog | Note the current HEAD hash first, then reset |

## Performance

**Optimizations for large repositories**

```bash
# Partial clone: skip downloading all blobs upfront
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/org/large-repo.git

# Sparse checkout: only materialize needed directories
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set src/my-module tests/my-module

# Shallow clone: limit history depth
git clone --depth=1 --single-branch https://github.com/org/repo.git

# Speed up status in large repos
git config core.fsmonitor true
git config core.untrackedCache true

# Maintenance: schedule background optimization
git maintenance start

# Commit graph: speed up log and merge-base operations
git commit-graph write --reachable
```
