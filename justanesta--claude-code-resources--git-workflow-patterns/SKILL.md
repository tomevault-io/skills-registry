# Git Workflow Patterns

Practical git workflow patterns for teams emphasizing clean history, safe collaboration, and reliable releases.

## Core Principles

1. **Atomic commits** - Each commit represents one logical change that compiles and passes tests
2. **Clear history** - Commit messages explain why, not what; diffs explain what
3. **Branch hygiene** - Short-lived feature branches, deleted after merge
4. **Linear history where possible** - Rebase feature branches before merging to main
5. **Automate the boring parts** - CI checks, changelog generation, version bumps

## Branching Strategies

**Use trunk-based development for most teams**

```bash
# Create a short-lived feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/add-user-auth

# Work on the feature (keep branch lifetime under 2 days)
git add src/auth.py src/middleware.py
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT-based user authentication"

# Update from main before pushing
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
git push -u origin feat/add-user-auth
```

Key strategy comparison:
- **Trunk-based**: Everyone commits to main (or short branches). Best for CI/CD and small teams.
- **GitHub Flow**: Feature branches + pull requests into main. Best for open source and mid-size teams.
- **GitFlow**: develop/release/hotfix branches. Best for scheduled releases with strict versioning.

See [branching-strategies.md](references/branching-strategies.md) for:
- Detailed trunk-based development workflow
- GitHub Flow step-by-step
- GitFlow branch naming and lifecycle
- Release branch management

## Commit Message Conventions

**Follow Conventional Commits format**

```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>
#
# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore
# Breaking changes: add ! after type or BREAKING CHANGE in footer

git commit -m "feat(api): add pagination to /users endpoint"
git commit -m "fix(auth): prevent token refresh race condition"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(api)!: change response format to JSON:API spec

BREAKING CHANGE: All API responses now follow JSON:API format.
Clients must update their parsers accordingly."
```

Rules:
- Subject line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- No period at the end of the subject
- Blank line between subject and body
- Body explains why, not what

See [commit-conventions.md](references/commit-conventions.md) for:
- Full Conventional Commits specification
- Semantic commit messages and changelog generation
- Squashing and fixup commit workflows
- Commit message templates

## Pull Request Best Practices

**Keep PRs small and focused on a single concern**

```bash
# Create a PR with a structured description
gh pr create --title "feat(auth): add JWT authentication" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Add JWT token generation and validation
- Add authentication middleware for protected routes
- Add refresh token rotation

## Test Plan
- [ ] Unit tests for token generation/validation
- [ ] Integration tests for middleware
- [ ] Manual test: login flow end-to-end

## Related
Closes #142
EOF
)"

# Request specific reviewers
gh pr edit 155 --add-reviewer alice,bob

# Enable auto-merge after CI passes
gh pr merge 155 --auto --squash
```

Guidelines:
- Target under 400 lines changed per PR
- One PR per feature or fix
- Use draft PRs for work-in-progress
- Require at least one approval before merge
- Run CI checks before review

See [pr-best-practices.md](references/pr-best-practices.md) for:
- PR description templates
- Review checklists and guidelines
- Draft PR workflows
- Auto-merge and CI integration

## Rebasing vs Merging

**Rebase feature branches, merge to main**

```bash
# Rebase your feature branch onto latest main
git checkout feat/new-feature
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts arise during rebase
# Fix each conflict, then continue
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue

# Force-push rebased branch (only your own feature branch)
git push --force-with-lease origin feat/new-feature

# Merge to main with a merge commit (preserves branch context)
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff feat/new-feature
```

When to use each:
- **Rebase**: Updating feature branch from main, cleaning up local commits
- **Merge --no-ff**: Integrating feature branch into main (preserves branch history)
- **Squash merge**: When feature branch has messy WIP commits
- **Fast-forward**: Only for trivial single-commit changes

See [rebase-merge-patterns.md](references/rebase-merge-patterns.md) for:
- Interactive rebase for history cleanup
- Merge strategies and when to use each
- Handling rebase conflicts safely
- Squash merge workflows

## Release Management

**Use semantic versioning with automated changelogs**

```bash
# Tag a release following semver
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0: Add user authentication"
git push origin v1.2.0

# Create a GitHub release with auto-generated notes
gh release create v1.2.0 --generate-notes --title "v1.2.0"

# Hotfix workflow
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.1 v1.2.0
# ... apply fix ...
git commit -m "fix(auth): patch token expiry vulnerability"
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix v1.2.1: Patch token expiry"
git push origin hotfix/v1.2.1 --tags
```

Versioning rules (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes that require client updates
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

See [release-management.md](references/release-management.md) for:
- Semantic versioning deep dive
- Automated changelog generation
- GitHub Releases and CI/CD automation
- Release branch strategies

## Merge Conflict Resolution

**Resolve conflicts methodically, not hastily**

```bash
# See which files have conflicts
git status

# Use a merge tool for complex conflicts
git mergetool

# For simple conflicts, edit manually
# Look for conflict markers:
#   <<<<<<< HEAD
#   (your changes)
#   =======
#   (incoming changes)
#   >>>>>>> feat/other-branch

# After resolving all conflicts
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue   # if rebasing
git merge --continue    # if merging

# Abort if things go wrong
git rebase --abort
git merge --abort
```

Prevention strategies:
- Keep branches short-lived (under 2 days)
- Rebase frequently from main
- Communicate with teammates about shared files
- Break large changes into smaller PRs

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| `git push --force` on shared branches | `git push --force-with-lease` on your own branch |
| Long-lived feature branches (weeks) | Short-lived branches merged within 1-2 days |
| Merge commits from main into feature branch | `git rebase origin/main` |
| Vague commit messages ("fix stuff") | Conventional Commits ("fix(auth): resolve token expiry") |
| Giant PRs with 1000+ lines | Small focused PRs under 400 lines |
| Committing directly to main | Feature branches with PR review |
| Manual version bumps | Automated versioning from commit history |
| Resolving conflicts by accepting all theirs/ours | Reviewing each conflict individually |

## Performance

- **Shallow clones for CI**: `git clone --depth 1` speeds up CI pipelines
- **Sparse checkout**: `git sparse-checkout set src/ tests/` for monorepos
- **Git LFS**: Track large binaries with `git lfs track "*.psd"` to keep repo small
- **Commit signing**: Use `git config commit.gpgsign true` without impacting speed
- **Ref cleanup**: Run `git remote prune origin` to remove stale remote branches
- **Garbage collection**: `git gc --aggressive` reclaims space in bloated repos
- **Partial clone**: `git clone --filter=blob:none` for faster initial clone of large repos
- **Fsmonitor**: Enable `git config core.fsmonitor true` for faster status on large worktrees
