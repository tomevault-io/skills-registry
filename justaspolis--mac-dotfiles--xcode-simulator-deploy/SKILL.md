# Xcode Simulator Deploy

Build an Xcode project and deploy to iOS Simulator.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get Xcode Tab Identifier

```
mcp_xcode_XcodeListWindows
```

Extract `tabIdentifier` from the response (e.g., `windowtab2`).

### Step 2: Build the Project

```
mcp_xcode_BuildProject with tabIdentifier
```

Wait for successful build.

### Step 3: Find the Built App

```bash
find ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData -name "AppName.app" -path "*Debug-iphonesimulator*" 2>/dev/null
```

Use the path from `Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/` (NOT `Index.noindex/Build/Products/`).

### Step 4: Find Target Simulator

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices | grep -i "device name"
```

Extract the UUID (e.g., `F574B0CD-C866-483C-BB1B-1B85E2B7BAE0`).

### Step 5: Install and Launch

```bash
xcrun simctl install <SIMULATOR_UUID> "<PATH_TO_APP>"
```

Get bundle identifier from Info.plist if unknown:

```bash
plutil -p "<PATH_TO_APP>/Info.plist" | grep -i bundleidentifier
```

Launch the app:

```bash
xcrun simctl launch <SIMULATOR_UUID> <BUNDLE_ID>
```

## Combined Command

After initial setup, combine install and launch:

```bash
xcrun simctl install <UUID> "<APP_PATH>" && xcrun simctl launch <UUID> <BUNDLE_ID>
```

## Notes

- Always use `mcp_xcode_BuildProject` instead of `xcodebuild` CLI for building
- The correct `.app` path is in `Build/Products/`, not `Index.noindex/Build/Products/`
- Boot simulator first if not already booted: `xcrun simctl boot <UUID>`
