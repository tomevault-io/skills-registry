# Session orientation

Action prompt for session start.
Run the commands below, synthesize results, and present project state to the user.

This command assumes the issue graph is healthy.
If you discover structural problems (cycles, broken references, inconsistent states), use beads-evolve instead.
If you need to validate graph health, use beads-audit first.

## Run orientation commands

Execute these commands now:

```bash
# First, ensure local DB is current
bd sync --import-only

# Quick human-readable summary (~20 lines)
bd status

# Recent activity (last 100 events)
bd activity

# Stale issues that may need attention
bd stale

# Epic progress
bd epic status
```

For structured data when needed (redirect to avoid context pollution):

```bash
# Create repo-specific temp file — bv JSON outputs can be thousands of lines
REPO=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
TRIAGE=$(mktemp "/tmp/bv-${REPO}-triage.XXXXXX.json")
bv --robot-triage > "$TRIAGE"

# Extract specific fields
jq '.quick_ref' "$TRIAGE"              # summary counts and top picks
jq '.recommendations[:3]' "$TRIAGE"    # top 3 recommendations
jq '.project_health.graph_metrics.cycles' "$TRIAGE"  # circular deps

# Clean up when done
rm "$TRIAGE"
```

For minimal structured output (safe for direct consumption):

```bash
# Just the single top pick — small JSON output
bv --robot-next

# Additional diagnostic tools
bv --robot-alerts           # drift + proactive alerts
bv --robot-drift            # detect configuration drift
```

For drift detection with exit codes (useful for automation):

```bash
# Exit codes: 0=OK, 1=critical drift, 2=warning
bv --check-drift
```

## Run execution planning commands

Extract three complementary perspectives on work prioritization:

```bash
# Parallel entry points (independent roots with no blockers)
bv --robot-plan | jq '[.plan.tracks[] | select(.reason == "Independent work stream") | .items[]] | map({id, title, unblocks})'

# Critical path (serialization bottleneck)
bv --robot-capacity | jq '{critical_path, critical_path_length}'

# Top 3 high-impact items (PageRank-based)
bv --robot-triage | jq '.triage.recommendations[:3] | map({id, title, score, action})'
```

For additional topological context:

```bash
# Full execution order respecting dependencies
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Stats.TopologicalOrder'
```

## Interpret results

From `bd status`:
- Total/Open/Blocked/Ready counts at a glance
- Recent activity from git history
- Human-readable, context-efficient

From `bd activity`:
- Real-time feed of issue mutations (create, update, delete)
- Event symbols: + (created), → (in_progress), ✓ (completed), ✗ (failed), ⊘ (deleted)
- Shows workflow progress and recent changes

From `bd stale`:
- Issues not updated in last 30 days (configurable with --days)
- Identifies potentially abandoned in_progress items
- Highlights forgotten or outdated issues

From `bv --robot-triage` (via jq extraction):
- `quick_ref` = at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations` = ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins` = low-effort high-impact items
- `stale_alerts` = issues needing attention
- `project_health` = status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics, cycles

From `bd epic status`:
- Progress percentages show which epics are advancing
- Stalled epics (0%) may indicate blocked critical paths

From execution planning commands:

**Parallel entry points** (from `--robot-plan` Track-B items):
- Issues with no blockers that can start immediately
- Multiple entry points can be worked in parallel by different sessions or agents
- The `unblocks` field shows downstream impact of completing each

**Critical path** (from `--robot-capacity`):
- The longest chain of dependent issues in the graph
- Completing critical path items reduces total project duration
- Items not on critical path have slack — delays there do not extend the project

**High-impact items** (from `--robot-triage` recommendations):
- PageRank-based scoring identifies issues that unlock the most downstream work
- Score reflects influence in the dependency graph, not urgency or effort
- Optimizes for "maximum downstream unlock" rather than "what to do first"

These three perspectives answer different questions:
- *"What can I start now?"* → Parallel entry points
- *"What reduces total duration?"* → Critical path
- *"What has the most influence?"* → High-impact items

### Implementation vs verification readiness

The dependency graph models *code/logical dependencies*, not *environment prerequisites*.
All graph roots (parallel entry points) are **implementation-ready** — you can write code now.
A subset of these are also **verification-ready** — you can test and validate immediately.

Distinguishing heuristics:

**Pure code modules** — usually verification-ready:
- Nix modules verifiable with `nix eval`, `nix build --dry-run`, or `nix-unit`
- Library code verifiable with type checking, unit tests, or static analysis
- These can be implemented AND verified in any order

**Infrastructure-creating issues** — verification-ready once dependencies complete:
- VM images, cluster provisioning, environment setup
- Once created, they establish the environment for downstream verification
- Example: k3s NixOS module → VM image → Colima profile → cluster exists

**Infrastructure-deploying issues** — verification-blocked until target exists:
- Kubernetes manifests, CNI plugins, certificates, operators
- Implementation-ready (can write the code) but verification requires the target environment
- Example: Cilium CNI module can be written now, but only verified after cluster exists

The **foundation chain** is the sequence of infrastructure-creating issues that establishes verification environments.
Completing the foundation chain unblocks verification for all infrastructure-deploying issues.

## Present synthesis

Determine presentation depth based on graph scale, then provide the user a concise summary with three prioritization perspectives.

### Scale-aware presentation

Tailor output verbosity to issue count to avoid overwhelming users with large graphs while providing complete information for small ones.

**Small graphs (< 30 open issues)**:
- Enumerate all parallel entry points with full details
- Show complete critical path with all nodes
- Full detail on all ready issues including descriptions
- Show complete dependency chains for recommendations

**Medium graphs (30-100 open issues)**:
- Show top 10 parallel entry points sorted by unblock count descending
- Show critical path with length and key milestones
- Group ready issues by epic with counts
- Summarize recommendations with links to full details

**Large graphs (> 100 open issues)**:
- Show top 5 parallel entry points by unblock count descending
- Show critical path length and first/last 3 nodes only
- Epic-level aggregation mandatory (see below)
- Per-epic top picks: best ready issue per major epic
- Partially-complete epic analysis for epics with progress > 0%

Determine scale tier at session start:

```bash
# Extract open count to determine tier
bd status | grep "Open:"
```

### Selection criteria

When showing a subset of issues at medium/large scale, apply these selection criteria:

**Parallel entry points**: sorted by unblock count (descending), then by PageRank score as tiebreaker. This prioritizes issues that unlock the most downstream work.

```bash
# Extract parallel entry points sorted by unblock count
bv --robot-plan | jq '[.plan.tracks[] | select(.reason == "Independent work stream") | .items[]] | sort_by(-.unblocks | length) | .[:10]'
```

**High-impact items**: sorted by PageRank score from `--robot-triage` recommendations. Score reflects influence in the dependency graph.

**Critical path**: computed by `bv --robot-capacity`, representing the longest dependency chain. Items on this path determine minimum project duration.

### Epic-level aggregation

For medium and large graphs, aggregate ready issues by epic to help users select a workstream:

```
Ready issues by epic:
- Domain layer (ironstar-abc): 12 ready, 8 blocked
- Frontend pipeline (ironstar-xyz): 5 ready, 15 blocked
- Event sourcing (ironstar-def): 3 ready, 10 blocked
```

Extract epic-level counts:

```bash
# Epic progress with ready/blocked breakdown
bd epic status

# Ready issues with hierarchy (shows parent epic)
bd list --ready --pretty
```

For large graphs, this aggregation is mandatory — show epic-level summaries before individual issue recommendations.

### Per-epic top picks

For large graphs, identify the best entry point for each major epic rather than only global recommendations:

```
Top pick per epic:
- Domain: ironstar-abc.5 (unblocks 4, verification-ready)
- Frontend: ironstar-xyz.1 (on critical path, unblocks 3)
- Event sourcing: ironstar-def.2 (unblocks 2, starts foundation chain)
```

This provides entry points into each workstream. Users can then focus on a specific epic without reviewing all 72+ ready issues.

Selection within each epic uses the same criteria: unblock count descending, PageRank as tiebreaker.

### Partially-complete epic analysis

For large graphs with epics showing progress > 0%, provide completion context:

```
Domain layer (42% complete):
- 12 issues closed, 8 ready, 12 blocked
- Next milestone: Complete aggregate implementations
- Blocking: ironstar-abc.7 (waiting on infrastructure)
```

This answers "why is X at Y%?" and "what's next for this epic?" without requiring users to drill into individual issues.

Extract progress data:

```bash
# Epic completion percentages
bd epic status

# Blocked issues within an epic
bd list --blocked | grep "ironstar-abc"
```

### Parallel track expansion

For parallel work recommendations at medium/large scale, show 2-3 issues per track rather than just the first:

```
Parallel tracks:
- Track 1 (foundation): A → B → C (creates environment)
- Track 2 (domain): D → E → F (core business logic)
- Track 3 (frontend): G → H (UI components)
```

This shows the next few issues in sequence, helping users understand what follows their immediate work item.

Extract track sequences:

```bash
# Full track sequences from robot-plan
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.tracks[] | {reason, items: [.items[] | {id, title}]}'
```

### Prioritization perspectives

Provide the user a concise summary with three prioritization perspectives:

**Health overview**:
- Use `quick_ref` counts — open/ready/blocked ratio assessment
- Epic progress — which epics are advancing vs stalled
- Alerts (if any) — stale issues, cycles, or health warnings from `project_health`

**Start here** (parallel entry points):
- List N issues that have no blockers and can be worked in parallel
- Show what each unblocks downstream
- Classify each as *verification-ready* (pure code, can test now) or *verification-blocked* (needs environment first)
- Identify the foundation chain if infrastructure-creating issues exist among roots
- Example: "These 3 issues are independent roots: nix-50f.2 (verification-ready), nix-50f.5 (needs cluster), nix-l2a.1 (needs credentials)"

**Critical path** (serialization bottleneck):
- Show the chain that determines minimum project duration
- Highlight which items on the path are ready vs blocked
- Example: "6-issue critical path: nix-50f → nix-50f.5 → ... → nix-50f.12"

**High impact** (PageRank recommendations):
- First 2-3 from `recommendations` with scores and what they unblock
- Quick wins from `quick_wins` that could be knocked out rapidly
- Note overlap or divergence with critical path items

### Example interpretation

Given parallel entry points `[A, B, C]` where:
- A creates an environment (k3s module, VM image)
- B deploys to that environment (CNI, operators)
- C is pure code (library, Nix module testable with `nix eval`)

The foundation chain might be: `A → D → E → ENVIRONMENT_EXISTS`

**Solo recommendation**:
1. Start with A (verification-ready) — implement and verify
2. Complete D and E (each verification-ready after predecessor) — verify environment exists
3. Now B and C can both be implemented AND verified
4. C could have been done earlier but verification order doesn't matter for pure code

**Parallel recommendation**:
- Track 1: A → D → E (foundation chain — creates environment)
- Track 2: B (implement now, verify after Track 1 completes)
- Track 3: C (implement and verify immediately — no environment dependency)

The key insight: all three roots (A, B, C) are *implementation-ready*, but only A and C are *verification-ready* at session start.

## Prompt work selection

Ask the user:
- Are you working solo (optimize for verification sequence) or parallel (maximize implementation throughput)?
- Which area would you like to focus on?
- Should we drill into a specific issue? (offer to run `bd dep tree <id> --direction both` and `bd show <id>`)
- Any context about priorities or constraints for this session?

**For solo work**: Recommend the foundation chain first — the sequence of infrastructure-creating issues that establishes environments.
Complete and verify each step before moving to the next, then branch to parallel implementation of deployment modules.

**For parallel work**: Recommend distributing across all implementation-ready roots.
Assign foundation chain to one track and pure code / deployment modules to others.
Verification will happen in waves as environments come online.

## Pre-work validation

Once an issue is selected, before starting implementation:

```bash
# Full dependency context
bd dep tree <selected-id> --direction both

# Detailed description (choose format based on needs)
bd show <selected-id>              # detailed view
bd show <selected-id> --refs       # show issues that reference this issue
bd show <selected-id> --short      # compact one-line output
bd show <selected-id> --thread     # show full conversation thread
```

Review with user:
- Is the description still accurate?
- Are listed dependencies still relevant?
- Is scope appropriate or should it be split first?

Update the issue if anything is stale before beginning work.
If updates were made, commit the database:

```bash
git add .beads/issues.jsonl && git commit -m "chore(beads): sync issues"
```
