# Engineer Expertise Extractor

Extract and document an engineer's coding expertise by analyzing their GitHub contributions, creating a structured knowledge base that captures their coding style, patterns, best practices, and architectural decisions.

## What This Skill Does

Researches an engineer's work to create a "digital mentor" by:

- **Analyzing Pull Requests** - Extract code patterns, review style, decisions
- **Extracting Coding Style** - Document their preferences and conventions
- **Identifying Patterns** - Common solutions and approaches they use
- **Capturing Best Practices** - Their quality standards and guidelines
- **Organizing Examples** - Real code samples from their work
- **Documenting Decisions** - Architectural choices and reasoning

## Why This Matters

**Knowledge Preservation:**

- Capture expert knowledge before they leave
- Document tribal knowledge
- Create mentorship materials
- Onboard new engineers faster

**Consistency:**

- Align team coding standards
- Replicate expert approaches
- Maintain code quality
- Scale expertise across team

**Learning:**

- Learn from senior engineers
- Understand decision-making
- See real-world patterns
- Improve code quality

## How It Works

### 1. Research Phase

Using GitHub CLI (`gh`), the skill:

- Fetches engineer's pull requests
- Analyzes code changes
- Reviews their comments and feedback
- Extracts patterns and conventions
- Identifies their expertise areas

### 2. Analysis Phase

Categorizes findings into:

- **Coding Style** - Formatting, naming, structure
- **Patterns** - Common solutions and approaches
- **Best Practices** - Quality guidelines
- **Architecture** - Design decisions
- **Testing** - Testing approaches
- **Code Review** - Feedback patterns
- **Documentation** - Doc style and practices

### 3. Organization Phase

Creates structured folders:

```
engineer_profiles/
└── [engineer_name]/
    ├── README.md (overview)
    ├── coding_style/
    │   ├── languages/
    │   ├── naming_conventions.md

## Output Structure

### Engineer Profile README

**Contains:**

- Engineer overview
- Areas of expertise
- Languages and technologies
- Key contributions
- Coding philosophy
- How to use this profile

### Coding Style Documentation

**Captures:**

- Naming conventions (variables, functions, classes)
- Code structure preferences
- File organization
- Comment style
- Formatting preferences
- Language-specific idioms

**Example:**

```markdown
# Coding Style: [Engineer Name]

## Naming Conventions

### Variables

- Use descriptive names: `userAuthentication` not `ua`
- Boolean variables: `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `canEdit`
- Collections: plural names `users`, `items`, `transactions`

### Functions

- Verb-first: `getUserById`, `validateInput`, `calculateTotal`
- Pure functions preferred
- Single responsibility

### Classes

- PascalCase: `UserService`, `PaymentProcessor`
- Interface prefix: `IUserRepository`
- Concrete implementations: `MongoUserRepository`

## Code Structure

### File Organization

- One class per file
- Related functions grouped together
- Tests alongside implementation
- Clear separation of concerns

### Function Length

- Max 20-30 lines preferred
- Extract helper functions
- Single level of abstraction
```

### Patterns Documentation

**Captures:**

- Recurring solutions
- Design patterns used
- Architectural patterns
- Problem-solving approaches

**Example:**

```markdown
# Common Patterns: [Engineer Name]

## Dependency Injection

Used consistently across services:

\`\`\`typescript // Pattern: Constructor injection class UserService { constructor( private readonly userRepo: IUserRepository, private readonly logger: ILogger ) {} } \`\`\`

**Why:** Testability, loose coupling, clear dependencies

## Error Handling

Consistent error handling approach:

\`\`\`typescript // Pattern: Custom error types + global handler class ValidationError extends Error { constructor(message: string) { super(message); this.name = 'ValidationError'; } }

// Usage if (!isValid(input)) { throw new ValidationError('Invalid input format'); } \`\`\`

**Why:** Type-safe errors, centralized handling, clear debugging
```

### Best Practices Documentation

**Captures:**

- Quality standards
- Testing approaches
- Performance guidelines
- Security practices
- Documentation standards

**Example:**

```markdown
# Best Practices: [Engineer Name]

## Testing

### Unit Test Structure

- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- One assertion per test preferred
- Test names describe behavior
- Mock external dependencies

\`\`\`typescript describe('UserService', () => { describe('createUser', () => { it('should create user with valid data', async () => { // Arrange const userData = { email: 'test@example.com', name: 'Test' }; const mockRepo = createMockRepository();

      // Act
      const result = await userService.createUser(userData);

      // Assert
      expect(result.id).toBeDefined();
      expect(result.email).toBe(userData.email);
    });

}); }); \`\`\`

### Test Coverage

- Aim for 80%+ coverage
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- Integration tests for APIs
- E2E tests for user flows

## Code Review Standards

### What to Check

- [ ] Tests included and passing
- [ ] No console.logs remaining
- [ ] Error handling present
- [ ] Comments explain "why" not "what"
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
```

### Architecture Documentation

**Captures:**

- Design decisions
- Technology choices
- Trade-offs made
- System design approaches

**Example:**

```markdown
# Architectural Decisions: [Engineer Name]

## Decision: Microservices vs Monolith

**Context:** Scaling user service **Decision:** Start monolith, extract services when needed **Reasoning:**

- Team size: 5 engineers
- Product stage: MVP
- Premature optimization risk
- Easier debugging and deployment

**Trade-offs:**

- Monolith pros: Simpler, faster development
- Monolith cons: Harder to scale later
- Decision: Optimize for current needs, refactor when hitting limits

## Decision: REST vs GraphQL

**Context:** API design for mobile app **Decision:** REST with versioning **Reasoning:**

- Team familiar with REST
- Simple use cases
- Caching easier
- Over-fetching not a problem yet

**When to reconsider:** If frontend needs complex queries
```

### Code Review Documentation

**Captures:**

- Feedback patterns
- Review approach
- Common suggestions
- Communication style

**Example:**

```markdown
# Code Review Style: [Engineer Name]

## Review Approach

### Priority Order

1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Logic errors
3. Test coverage
4. Code structure
5. Naming and style

### Feedback Style

- Specific and constructive
- Explains "why" behind suggestions
- Provides examples
- Asks questions to understand reasoning

### Common Suggestions

**Security:**

- "Consider input validation here"
- "This query is vulnerable to SQL injection"
- "Should we rate-limit this endpoint?"

**Performance:**

- "This N+1 query could be optimized with a join"
- "Consider caching this expensive operation"
- "Memoize this pure function"

**Testing:**

- "Can we add a test for the error case?"
- "What happens if the API returns null?"
- "Let's test the boundary conditions"

**Code Quality:**

- "Can we extract this into a helper function?"
- "This function is doing too many things"
- "Consider a more descriptive variable name"
```

### Profile Maintenance

**Regular Updates:**

- Refresh every quarter
- Add new significant PRs
- Update with latest patterns
- Archive outdated practices

**Quality Control:**

- Verify extracted patterns
- Review examples for relevance
- Update documentation
- Remove deprecated practices

### Effective Usage

**For Learning:**

- Study patterns with context
- Understand reasoning behind choices
- Practice applying techniques
- Ask questions when unclear

**For Replication:**

- Start with style guide
- Reference patterns for similar problems
- Adapt to current context
- Don't blindly copy

## Limitations

**What This Extracts:**
