# Agent Coordination for Zero-Day Attack

This skill provides guidance for selecting and coordinating agents and skills when working on Zero-Day Attack. For structured planning workflows, use the `/start-planning` command.

## Available Agents

## Agent Selection by Context

Agents trigger automatically based on context:

| When Working On              | Primary Agent         | Supporting Agents                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Architecture decisions       | code-architect        | game-designer                    |
| Game rules or mechanics      | game-designer         | code-architect                   |
| Token or tile implementation | code-architect        | input-developer, ui-ux-developer |
| Touch/glyph handling         | input-developer       | code-architect                   |
| Layout or positioning        | ui-ux-developer       | code-architect                   |
| Unity scene hierarchy        | scene-builder         | mcp-advisor                      |
| Writing tests                | test-engineer         | code-architect                   |
| Build or deployment          | deployment-specialist | -                                |
| MCP issues or tool selection | mcp-advisor           | -                                |
| Documentation updates        | project-producer      | -                                |

**Note:** For any implementation work, include `code-architect` to ensure proper layer separation and architectural consistency.

## Skill and Agent Pairing Examples

**Bug in token placement:**

- Load: `board-sdk`, `project-architecture`
- Agents: `input-developer` (SDK behavior), `code-architect` (state flow)

**New game feature:**

- Load: `zero-day-rules`, `project-architecture`
- Agents: `game-designer` (rules), `code-architect` (implementation)

**Visual/layout issue:**

- Load: `layout-sizing`, `visual-style-guide`
- Agents: `ui-ux-developer` (visuals), `code-architect` (if code changes needed)

**Unity scene work:**

- Load: `unity-mcp-tools`
- Agents: `scene-builder` (hierarchy), `mcp-advisor` (tool selection)
- Enable MCP tools first: `/unity-mcp-enable scene-read gameobject`

**Writing tests:**

- Load: `unity-testing`, `project-architecture`
- Agents: `test-engineer`

## Technical Notes

### Subagent Capabilities

**Subagents CAN:**

- Use MCP tools directly when enabled by orchestrator
- Access skills declared in their frontmatter
- Use standard Claude Code tools (Read, Edit, Bash, etc.)

**Subagents CANNOT:**

- Execute slash commands
- Enable/disable MCP tools

### MCP Tool Workflow

1. Orchestrator enables tools with this command: `/unity-mcp-enable [groups]`
2. Spawn agent with MCP-related task
3. Agent uses MCP tools directly
4. Orchestrator resets toools with this commmand: `/unity-mcp-reset`

### Agent Results

After agents complete, consider:

- Which agent provided which insight (attribution)
- Agent IDs for potential resumption
- Consensus or conflicts among findings

## Commands

| Command                      | Purpose                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `/start-planning [task]`     | Structured planning workflow   |
| `/unity-mcp-enable [groups]` | Enable MCP tools before agents |
| `/unity-mcp-reset`           | Disable MCP tools after work   |
| `/update-documentation`      | Document changes               |
