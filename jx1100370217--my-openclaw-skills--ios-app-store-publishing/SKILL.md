### Screenshots
| Device | Size | Slots |

4. Use device frames (optional)
5. Localize for major markets

### App Preview Videos
- 15-30 seconds optimal
- No hands/devices in frame
- Start with impact moment
- Include captions (often muted)

## Common Rejection Reasons

### Guideline 2.1 - App Completeness
**Issue:** Crashes, placeholder content, incomplete features
**Fix:** Thorough testing, remove "Coming Soon" features

### Guideline 2.3 - Accurate Metadata
**Issue:** Screenshots don't match app, misleading description
**Fix:** Update screenshots, honest descriptions

### Guideline 4.2 - Minimum Functionality
**Issue:** App is too simple, web wrapper, template
**Fix:** Add unique features, native functionality

### Guideline 5.1.1 - Data Collection
**Issue:** Missing privacy disclosures
**Fix:** Complete App Privacy section accurately

### Guideline 3.1.1 - In-App Purchase
**Issue:** Linking to external payment
**Fix:** Use StoreKit for digital goods

## Privacy Requirements

### App Privacy Labels
Must disclose in App Store Connect:
- Data collected (contact, location, etc.)
- How data is used (analytics, advertising, etc.)
- Whether data is linked to user
- Whether data is used for tracking
