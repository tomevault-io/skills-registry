# Context Doctor

Diagnose and visualize how the context window budget is allocated.

## Quick Start

Run the visualization script:

```bash
python3 scripts/context-doctor.py
```

The script auto-detects:
- Workspace path (`~/.openclaw/workspace` or `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE` env)
- OpenClaw version (via `openclaw --version`)
- Installed skills (system + workspace)
- Bootstrap file sizes and status

## Output Sections

### 1. Workspace Files
Shows each bootstrap file with:
- **Status**: ✓ OK / ✗ MISSING / ⚠ TRUNCATED (symlink target missing = MISSING)
- **Characters & Tokens**: Raw size and estimated token count (chars/4)
- **Visual bar**: Proportional to file size

### 2. Installed Skills
Lists all discovered SKILL.md files from system and workspace skill directories.
Skills are loaded on-demand, not in bootstrap — shown for awareness only.

### 3. Token Budget
Breaks down bootstrap overhead:
- System Prompt (framework)
- Workspace Files (from scan)
- Skills List (metadata descriptions)
- Tool Schemas + Summaries

Shows total bootstrap % vs free conversation space.

## Diagnostic Signals

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 🔴 TRUNCATED | File exceeded max chars, silently cut | Reduce file size or split content |
| 🟡 MISSING | File not found or broken symlink | Check path, fix symlink target |
| 🟢 Bootstrap <10% | Healthy | No action needed |
| 🟠 Bootstrap >15% | Heavy | Review workspace files for bloat |

## Image Output (for chat / sharing)

Generate a PNG image directly — no terminal screenshot needed:

```bash
python3 scripts/context-doctor.py --png /tmp/context-doctor.png
```

The script renders a colored terminal-style image via Rich SVG export.
Requires: `rich` (pip3 install rich) + one of: `rsvg-convert` (brew install librsvg) or `cairosvg` (pip3 install cairosvg).

**Agent workflow**: When a user asks about context health in chat, run with `--png` and send the image directly. The output path is printed to stdout on success.
