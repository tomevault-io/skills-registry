## When to use

Use this skill whenever you are dealing with Remotion code to obtain the domain-specific knowledge.

## Prerequisites

Before starting a new Remotion project, run `scripts/check-prereqs.sh` (in this skill directory).

**Interpreting results:**
- `"status":"ok"` → proceed
- `"status":"missing"` or `"status":"outdated"` → help user install/upgrade

**Installation guidance by status:**

| Dependency | If missing/outdated |
|------------|---------------------|
| node | Link to https://nodejs.org/ or suggest `nvm install 20` |
| npm | Comes with Node; if missing, Node install is broken |
| ffmpeg | macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`. Linux: `apt install ffmpeg`. Windows: https://ffmpeg.org/. Note: Remotion auto-installs if missing during render, so this is soft-fail |

**When to skip checks:**
- User already has a working Remotion project (check for `package.json` with `remotion` dependency)
- User explicitly says they have prerequisites

## Quick start commands

```bash
# New project
npx create-video@latest my-video

# Add to existing React project
npm install --save-exact remotion @remotion/cli

# Run studio (dev server)
npx remotion studio

# Render video
npx remotion render src/index.ts CompositionId out/video.mp4
```

## After Execution

After completing the skill output, log feedback to track quality over time.

**Priority cascade:**
1. If `scripts/evaluate.sh` exists in this skill directory, run it and use the JSON result
2. Otherwise, self-assess using the scale below

**Self-assessment scale:** 1=failed, 2=poor, 3=acceptable, 4=good, 5=excellent

**To log feedback**, append one JSON line to `FEEDBACK.jsonl` in this skill directory:

```json
{"ts":"<UTC ISO 8601>","skill":"remotion","version":"<from CONFIG.yaml>","prompt":"<user's original request>","outcome":<1-5>,"note":"<brief note if not 4>","source":"llm","schema_version":1}
```

Then increment `iteration_count` under `compaction` in `CONFIG.yaml`.
