# Hue Instant Control (Hue Gateway v2)

You control Philips Hue **only** via the already-running Hue Gateway service.

You translate fuzzy user requests into **specific** actions on **specific** Hue entities (rooms/zones/lights).
Keep the interaction short, confident, and “assistant-y”.

## Preferred execution path (when available)

If you have access to the server-side tool **`hueGateway`**, use it.

- It calls Hue Gateway **v2** (`POST /v2/actions`) directly from the server (no bash/curl).
- It applies safe defaults and deterministic correlation/idempotency keys.
- Use it for: `inventory.snapshot`, `room.set`, `zone.set`, `light.set`, `grouped_light.set`, `scene.activate`, `resolve.by_name`, `actions.batch`.
- `clipv2.request` is an escape hatch but should be **GET/HEAD/OPTIONS only**.

**Read-only rule (important):**
- For “list/what’s in …” requests, do **exactly 1** `hueGateway` call: `inventory.snapshot`, then answer from the snapshot.
- Avoid chaining `resolve.by_name` for simple listing; you can match names directly in `result.rooms[]` / `result.zones[]` and filter `result.lights[]`.

Only use Bash/curl when:
- the user explicitly asks for bash/curl,
- tool calling is unavailable, or
- Hue Gateway tooling is disabled by config / access policy.

## Performance goal (always)

- **Goal:** operate the Hue Gateway with near-zero errors and minimal latency.
- **Default:** 1 tool call per user request (prefer `hueGateway`; otherwise 1 Bash tool call bundling all curl calls).
- **Do not waste time:** avoid repeated health/discovery work once the gateway is known reachable.
- **Always use tight timeouts** on curl so fallbacks are instant.

## Safety + UX rules (always)

1) **Never guess the target.**
   - If the room/zone/light is unclear or ambiguous, ask a quick follow-up.
2) **Avoid “whole house” surprises.**
   - If the request affects more than 2 rooms, or uses words like “all”, “everywhere”, “house”, “downstairs”, ask for confirmation.
3) **Do what the user meant, not what they said literally.**
   - Example: “make it cozy” → turn on + dim + warm color temp.
4) **Be honest about execution.**
   - Only claim lights changed if you actually executed the API call (via Bash), or the user confirms they ran your curl.
5) **Prefer room-level control** (`grouped_light`) unless the user asks for a specific individual light.

## Rooms vs zones (do not confuse these)

Hue has **rooms** and **zones**:
- A **room** contains lights.
- A **zone** groups multiple rooms (often “Downstairs/Upstairs/Beneden/Boven”), and zone lighting affects all its rooms.

Users often say “room” or “in <name>” when they really mean an **area** that could be either a room or a zone. Treat room/zone naming as interchangeable user language.

When the user gives a name (e.g. “Keuken”):
1) Call `inventory.snapshot` (one tool call).
2) Normalize-match the name against **both** `result.rooms[].name` and `result.zones[].name`.
3) If it matches exactly one → proceed using the correct concept:
   - room match → filter lights by `light.roomRid == room.rid`
   - zone match → collect `zone.roomRids[]`, then filter lights where `light.roomRid` is in that set
4) If it matches **both** a room and a zone → ask which they meant.
5) If it matches **neither** → ask a quick follow-up and show a few candidates from rooms + zones.

## Gateway connection (defaults)

- Base URL (default): `http://hue-gateway:8000` (recommended when using docker sandboxd + shared network)
- Auth header (either works for `/v2/*`):
  - `Authorization: Bearer dev-token`
  - `X-API-Key: dev-key`

Environment override knobs:
- `BASE_URL`: Hue Gateway base URL.
- `HUE_AUTH_HEADER`: full header line to use for auth (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer ...` or `X-API-Key: ...`).
- `HUE_TOKEN`: bearer token value (used if `HUE_AUTH_HEADER` is unset).
- `HUE_API_KEY`: API key value (used if `HUE_AUTH_HEADER` is unset).

Important: if you execute via a sandboxed Bash tool, `localhost` refers to the **sandbox**, not the host machine running Hue Gateway.
Important: Bash tool calls do **not** preserve shell state between tool invocations; keep base URL selection + actions in the same Bash call, or set `BASE_URL` explicitly each time.

### Base URL selection (do this first)

If `BASE_URL` is not provided, try these in order until health succeeds:

1) `http://hue-gateway:8000` (recommended when Hue Gateway is attached to the sandbox network)
2) `http://host.docker.internal:8000` (common for Docker Desktop on macOS/Windows)
3) `http://localhost:8000` (only works when executing on the same host/network namespace as the gateway)

## Common mistakes (avoid)

- Do not use `localhost:8000` from a sandboxed Bash tool unless you know the gateway is in the same network namespace.
- Do not parse `result.data` for `clipv2.request`; Hue resources are at `result.body.data`.
- Do not use `curl -f` for `/v2/actions` calls (it hides useful JSON error bodies); use `curl -sS`.
- Prefer RID-based `grouped_light.set` (names are often missing/ambiguous for grouped lights).
- Do not try to parse curl JSON with `python3 - <<'PY' ... json.load(sys.stdin) ... PY` (stdin is already used for the
  Python program). Use `python3 -c ... <<<"$JSON"` (or `jq`) instead.

## Quick start (recommended path)

1) **Select `BASE_URL` + ensure ready** (fast; put this at the top of the same Bash tool call where you run actions):

```bash
set -euo pipefail

CURL_HEALTH='curl -fsS --connect-timeout 1 --max-time 2'

BASE_URL="${BASE_URL:-}" # optional: user/environment provided
if [ -z "$BASE_URL" ]; then
  for base in "http://hue-gateway:8000" "http://host.docker.internal:8000" "http://localhost:8000"; do
    if $CURL_HEALTH "$base/healthz" >/dev/null; then
      BASE_URL="$base"
      break
    fi
  done
fi

[ -n "$BASE_URL" ] || { echo "Hue Gateway not reachable from this environment. Set BASE_URL to a reachable base URL."; exit 1; }
BASE_URL="${BASE_URL%/}"
echo "Using BASE_URL=$BASE_URL"

READY_JSON="$($CURL_HEALTH "$BASE_URL/readyz")"
case "$READY_JSON" in
  *'"ready":true'*|*'"ready": true'*) : ;;
  *) echo "Hue Gateway is not ready (ready=false)."; exit 1 ;;
esac

AUTH_HEADER="${HUE_AUTH_HEADER:-}"
if [ -z "$AUTH_HEADER" ]; then
  if [ -n "${HUE_API_KEY:-}" ]; then
    AUTH_HEADER="X-API-Key: $HUE_API_KEY"
  else
    AUTH_HEADER="Authorization: Bearer ${HUE_TOKEN:-dev-token}"
  fi
fi
```

2) **Discover inventory** (normalized read model; preferred over raw CLIP resources):

```bash
curl -sS --connect-timeout 1 --max-time 8 -X POST "$BASE_URL/v2/actions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-Id: demo-rooms-1" \
  -H "$AUTH_HEADER" \
  -d '{"requestId":"demo-rooms-1","action":"inventory.snapshot","args":{}}'
```

Optional helper: if this skill is installed under `./.skills` (RemcoChat default), you can get a parsed list as:

```bash
bash ./.skills/hue-instant-control/scripts/list_rooms.sh
```

This prints: `<room-name>\t<grouped_light_rid>\t<room_rid>`.

3) **Set a named room (fast + verified)** using a single v2 action:

```bash
bash ./.skills/hue-instant-control/scripts/room_set_by_name.sh --room "Woonkamer" --brightness 35 --color-temp-k 2400
```

4) (Optional) **Set a room by grouped-light RID** using `grouped_light.set` (RID-based; no guessing):

```bash
curl -sS --connect-timeout 1 --max-time 8 -X POST "$BASE_URL/v2/actions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-Id: demo-gl-1" \
  -H "$AUTH_HEADER" \
  -d '{"requestId":"demo-gl-1","action":"grouped_light.set","args":{"rid":"<GROUPED_LIGHT_RID>","state":{"on":true,"brightness":35,"colorTempK":2400}}}'
```

Note: for `clipv2.request` responses, Hue resources are at `result.body.data` (not `result.data`).

5) **Set a named lamp / plug** using `light.set` (fast; no discovery needed):

```bash
curl -sS --connect-timeout 1 --max-time 8 -X POST "$BASE_URL/v2/actions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-Id: demo-light-1" \
  -H "$AUTH_HEADER" \
  -d '{"requestId":"demo-light-1","action":"light.set","args":{"name":"Vibiemme","state":{"on":true}}}'
```

Optional helper script (handles base URL selection + readiness + auth):

```bash
bash ./.skills/hue-instant-control/scripts/light_set_by_name.sh --name "Vibiemme" --on true
```

6) **Apply a deterministic “vibe” preset** (reduces LLM variability):

```bash
bash ./.skills/hue-instant-control/scripts/room_vibe.sh --room "Woonkamer" --vibe cozy
```

7) **Set a named zone** (safe by default; requires `--confirm` when it affects >2 rooms):

```bash
bash ./.skills/hue-instant-control/scripts/zone_set_by_name.sh --zone "Downstairs" --on false
bash ./.skills/hue-instant-control/scripts/zone_set_by_name.sh --zone "Downstairs" --on false --confirm
```

8) **List all lights in a named zone (read-only; first-time-right)**:

```bash
bash ./.skills/hue-instant-control/scripts/zone_list_lights.sh --zone "Beneden" --print-ok
```

9) **List lights in a named room (read-only; first-time-right)**:

```bash
bash ./.skills/hue-instant-control/scripts/room_list_lamps.sh --room "Woonkamer" --print-ok
```
