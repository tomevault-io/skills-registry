description: Review the current session and propose new skills that could be created. Use when the user says "propose skills", "what skills could help", "find skill opportunities", "learn-skill", or after a long session to identify reusable patterns worth codifying into skills. Use when this capability is needed.

Review this session and identify patterns that would benefit from being codified as reusable skills.

Look for:

- **Repeated workflows**: Multi-step procedures performed more than once or likely to recur
- **Domain expertise applied**: Specialized knowledge about tools, APIs, or systems that had to be recalled or looked up
- **Workarounds**: Non-obvious solutions to tool limitations or environment quirks
- **Complex procedures**: Multi-step processes where ordering, flags, or edge cases matter
- **Tool orchestration**: Patterns combining multiple tools in a specific way

For each candidate skill, determine:

1. **Name**: Hyphen-case identifier
2. **Description**: What the skill would do and when it triggers (this becomes frontmatter)
3. **What it would contain**: Instructions, scripts, references, or assets
4. **Placement**: Project-level (`.claude/skills/`) or user-level (`~/.claude/skills/`)
   - Project-level: Tied to this specific codebase, tech stack, or repo conventions
   - User-level: Generally useful across projects
   - If unclear, ask the user

Skip patterns that:

- Are already covered by an existing skill
- Are standard language/framework usage Claude already knows
- Would be used only once
- Are better captured as an AGENTS.md learning (use `/learn` for those)

Present each proposal in this format:

```
## <skill-name>

**Description:** <frontmatter description — what it does and when to trigger>
**Contains:** <brief list: instructions only, or scripts/references/assets needed>
**Placement:** <user-level | project-level> — <one-line rationale>
**Rationale:** <why this is worth a skill — what pain it prevents>
```

After presenting proposals, ask the user which (if any) they want to create, then hand off to `/skill-creator` with the relevant context.
