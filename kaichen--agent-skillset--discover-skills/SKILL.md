# Discover Skills

Help users explore and understand available Claude Code skills.

## Instructions

When invoked, search for and present all available skills in an organized manner.

### Steps

1. **List Loaded Skills**

   Skills from `~/.claude/skills/` and installed plugins are **already loaded** - check the Skill tool's "Available skills" list first.

2. **Search for Additional Skills**

   Use Glob tool to find uninstalled skills in the current project:

   ```
   # Plugin skills in workspace
   Glob: pattern="**/plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md"
   ```

3. **Search from Github via preset awesome list and Search using keyword**

   Dicovery skills via networking github colleciton repo, request to view readme for discovery more.

4. **Parse Skill Metadata**

   Extract from each SKILL.md frontmatter:
   - `name`: Skill identifier
   - `description`: What the skill does

5. **Present Results**

   ```markdown
   ## Available Skills

   | Skill | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | /skill-name | Brief description |

   ---

   **Tips:**
   - Use `/skill-name` to invoke a skill directly
   - Create custom skills in `.claude/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md`
   - Project skills (`.claude/skills/`) override global ones (`~/.claude/skills/`)
   ```

### Skill Locations

| Location | Scope | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `.claude/skills/` | Project | Highest |
| Plugin bundles | Plugin | Medium |
| `~/.claude/skills/` | User (global) | Lowest |

### Handling No Skills Found

If no skills are discovered:
1. Inform the user that no custom skills were found
2. Mention built-in skills from Claude Code (commit, code-review, etc.)
3. Provide guidance on creating custom skills
4. Recommend exploring skill collections (see below)

# Search for SKILL.md files (most accurate)
gh search repos "SKILL.md in:path" --limit 30 --json fullName,description,stargazersCount,defaultBranch,createdAt,updatedAt

# Search agent-skills repos
gh search repos "skills" --limit 30 --match readme --json fullName,description,stargazersCount,defaultBranch,createdAt,updatedAt
```

### Get Repository Details

```bash
# Get README content for skill overview
gh repo view owner/repo

# Download specific SKILL.md file
gh repo view owner/repo --raw path/to/SKILL.md > skill.md
```

### Explore Skill Contents

```bash
# List skills directory structure
gh api repos/owner/repo/contents/skills --jq '.[].name'

# Get specific SKILL.md content (use --decode on macOS, -d on Linux)
gh api repos/owner/repo/contents/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md --jq '.content' | base64 --decode

# List all SKILL.md files in repo
gh api repos/owner/repo/git/trees/main?recursive=1 --jq '.tree[] | select(.path | endswith("SKILL.md")) | .path'
```

### Quick Install from GitHub

```bash
# Clone entire skills repo as plugin
gh repo clone owner/repo ~/.claude/plugins/repo-name

# Download single skill
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/skill-name
gh repo view owner/repo --raw skills/skill-name/SKILL.md > ~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
