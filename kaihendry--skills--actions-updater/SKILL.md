# GitHub Actions Version Updater

Update GitHub Actions in workflow files to their latest released versions. This replaces Dependabot's `package-ecosystem: "github-actions"` functionality.

## Process

### Step 1: Check for Updates

Run the bundled script to parse all `uses:` lines and query each action's latest release:

    uv run actions-updater/scripts/check_updates.py

With no arguments, the script scans `.github/workflows/*.yml` and `*.yaml`. To check specific files:

    uv run actions-updater/scripts/check_updates.py path/to/workflow.yaml

The script parses workflow YAML, recursively extracts all `uses: owner/repo@version` entries, queries `gh release view --repo owner/repo` for each, and outputs a comparison table showing the current and latest major versions. It skips local actions (`./...`) and Docker actions (`docker://...`).

### Step 2: Update Workflow Files

For each action with an available update, edit the workflow file using the Edit tool.

**Version format rules:**
- If the current pin is a major version tag (e.g., `@v3`), extract the major version from the latest release tag and update to that (e.g., `v4.2.1` becomes `@v4`)
- If the current pin is an exact version (e.g., `@v3.1.0`), update to the full latest release tag
- If the current pin is a SHA, flag it for the user but do not auto-update

### Step 3: Summarize

Present a table of all updates applied, showing the action, old version, and new version.

## Scripts

### `scripts/check_updates.py`

Check all workflow actions for available updates. Requires authenticated `gh` CLI.

    uv run scripts/check_updates.py                      # scans .github/workflows/
    uv run scripts/check_updates.py path/to/ci.yaml      # specific file(s)
