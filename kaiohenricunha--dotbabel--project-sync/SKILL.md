# project-sync — Repo-local cross-CLI fan-out

Thin wrapper around `dotbabel project-sync`. The binary owns all writes; this
skill maps natural-language requests to the right invocation and surfaces
dry-run output before mutating the repo.

## When to invoke

- The user wants to adopt cross-CLI workflows in a repo that already has
  `.claude/commands/*` or `.claude/skills/*`, but no `AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md`/
  `.github/prompts/`/`.github/instructions/` wiring.
- A new command or skill was just added to `.claude/`, and the user wants
  Codex/Gemini/Copilot to see it without leaving the editor.
- The user asks for "drift check" or "is this repo synced" — run
  `dotbabel check-project-sync` instead and surface the diff.
- First-time setup: if `.dotbabel.json` is missing, suggest
  `dotbabel project-init` first.

## Workflow

1. **Pre-flight.** Confirm cwd is a git repo and contains `CLAUDE.md` (with or
   without rule-floor markers) plus at least one of `.claude/commands/` or
   `.claude/skills/`. If `.dotbabel.json` is absent, mention that defaults will
   apply (no `cli_substitutions`, full fan-out to codex/gemini/copilot,
   gating on each CLI's `command -v` check).
2. **Dry-run first.** Always run `dotbabel project-sync --dry-run` before
   mutating. Summarize the planned actions to the user (count of instruction
   files, count of new symlinks per CLI). Pause for confirmation **unless**
   the user already said "do it" or "go ahead" in the same turn.
3. **Apply.** Run `dotbabel project-sync` (no `--dry-run`). If the user passed
   `--all`, propagate it.
4. **Verify.** Run `dotbabel check-project-sync` and report `ok` /
   `missing` / `stale` counts. Exit non-zero output should be surfaced.

## Triggers and invocations

| Trigger phrase                                        | Invocation                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| "sync this repo", "project sync", "fan out commands"  | `dotbabel project-sync --dry-run` then apply               |
| "wire up gemini for this project"                     | `dotbabel project-sync --all` (covers all)                 |
| "is this repo synced", "drift check the project sync" | `dotbabel check-project-sync` (read-only)                  |
| "regenerate AGENTS.md for this project"               | `dotbabel project-sync` (instructions are part of the run) |
| "set up project sync here", "first-time project sync" | `dotbabel project-init` then project-sync                  |

## Reference: Copilot mapping

The Copilot CLI fan-out targets `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` (commands) and
`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` (skills) inside the target repo.
See [`references/copilot-mapping.md`](references/copilot-mapping.md) for the
full layout and rationale.

## Boundaries

- Always operate on the user's current working directory unless they pass an
  explicit `--repo <path>`. Never silently target a different repo.
- Never run `--force`. The plan reserves it for collision overrides; defer
  to the binary's existing collision warnings.
- For consumer repos with no `.dotbabel.json`, the convention path applies
  (entire `CLAUDE.md` becomes the rule floor when markers are absent).
- This skill is for **project-scope** sync. For user-scope (`~/.claude/`,
  `~/.codex/`, `~/.gemini/`) bootstrap, use `dotbabel bootstrap` instead.
