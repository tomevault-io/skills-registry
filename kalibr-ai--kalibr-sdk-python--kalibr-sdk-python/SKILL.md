# Kalibr — agents that fix themselves

Kalibr lets agents choose the optimal model + tools for any task, across any modality, as they run in production.

You define candidate execution paths — model + tools + parameters. Kalibr figures out which one wins for each task from real production telemetry. When a path degrades at 3am, your agents are already on the next best path. No alerts. No debugging. No you.

## When to use this

- User is building agents and asks about reliability, failover, or model selection
- User's agent is failing because a model provider is degraded or down
- User wants different tasks routed to different models automatically
- User is hardcoding `model="gpt-4o"` and wants something that adapts
- User asks about production monitoring, cost optimization, or agent routing
- User asks how to stop agents from breaking when a provider has an outage
- User is building multimodal agents and wants unified optimization across text, voice, and image
- User wants to route HuggingFace models based on production outcomes

## Install

```bash
pip install kalibr
```

Get credentials at https://dashboard.kalibr.systems/settings

```bash
export KALIBR_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export KALIBR_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
```

### Install via OpenClaw

```bash
openclaw plugins install @kalibr/openclaw
```

## Quick start

```python
from kalibr import Router

router = Router(
    goal="extract-emails",
    paths=[
        {"model": "gpt-4o", "tools": ["web_search"]},
        {"model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"},
        {"model": "gemini-2.0-flash", "params": {"temperature": 0.2}},
    ]
)

response = router.completion(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Extract emails from this page..."}]
)

# This is how Kalibr learns — tell it what worked
router.report(success="@" in response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Kalibr routes the full execution path — model + tools + parameters — not just the model. After ~20 outcomes it knows what's winning. After 50 it's locked in and adapting.

## Auto-reporting

Skip manual reporting — define success inline:

```python
router = Router(
    goal="extract-emails",
    paths=["gpt-4o", "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "gemini-2.0-flash"],
    success_when=lambda output: "@" in output,
)

# Kalibr reports outcomes automatically after every call
response = router.completion(messages=[...])
```

## How it's different

**OpenRouter / LiteLLM routing**: Model proxy. Routes based on price, speed, availability. Doesn't know if the response was actually good for your task.

**Fallback systems** (LangChain ModelFallbackMiddleware): Reactive. Waits for a failure, then tries the next model. You already lost that request.

**Kalibr**: Learns from your actual production telemetry — per task, per path. Routes to what's working before anything breaks. 10% canary traffic keeps testing alternatives so Kalibr catches degradation before your users do.

## Works with

- **LangChain / LangGraph**: `pip install langchain-kalibr` — drop-in ChatModel
- **CrewAI**: Pass `ChatKalibr` as any agent's `llm`
- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: Drop-in replacement
- **Any Python code that calls an LLM**
- **HuggingFace**: Any of 17 task types across every modality

## How it works

Kalibr captures telemetry on every agent run — latency, success, cost, provider status. It uses Thompson Sampling to balance exploration (trying paths) vs. exploitation (using the best). 10% canary traffic keeps testing alternatives so Kalibr catches degradation before your users do.

Success rate always dominates. Kalibr never sacrifices quality for cost.
