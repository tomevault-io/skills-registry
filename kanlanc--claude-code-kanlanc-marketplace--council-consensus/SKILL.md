# Council Consensus Skill

Multi-perspective analysis with both Codex and Gemini, each exploring for/against/neutral viewpoints for comprehensive evaluation.

## When to Use

- Evaluating technology choices
- Architecture decisions
- Trade-off analysis
- When user needs pros and cons
- Comparing different approaches
- Decision-making support

## Reasoning Level

**high** (default for balanced analysis)

## Execution

1. Identify the topic/question for consensus
2. Gather relevant context

3. For each model, request stance-based analysis:
   ```
   Analyze this topic from multiple perspectives:

   Topic: <topic or decision>

   Please provide:
   1. **FOR** arguments - Best case for this approach
   2. **AGAINST** arguments - Concerns and risks
   3. **NEUTRAL** assessment - Objective analysis
   4. **Recommendation** - Your balanced conclusion
   ```

4. Run **BOTH** commands in parallel:

   **Codex:**
   ```bash
   codex exec --sandbox read-only -c model_reasoning_effort="high" "<prompt>"
   ```

   **Gemini:**
   ```bash
   gemini -s -y -o json "<prompt>"
   ```

5. Synthesize multi-model, multi-perspective analysis
