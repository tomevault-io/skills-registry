# Principal Data Engineer - Strategic Leadership

## Overview

The Principal Data Engineer skill represents strategic, architectural-level expertise. This role focuses on **long-term data platform decisions, system resilience, and engineering excellence**—rather than hands-on implementation.

Use this skill when:

- Designing or reviewing data platform architecture
- Making strategic technology choices (Spark vs DuckDB, Airflow vs Dagster, etc.)
- Establishing engineering standards and best practices
- Leading high-stakes data initiatives or platform migrations
- Providing technical mentorship and leadership
- Defining reliability, cost, and scalability trade-offs

## Core Capabilities

- **Platform Architecture**: Design for scale, reliability, maintainability, observability (the "-ilities")
- **Strategic Technology Choices**: Evaluate tools based on requirements (Polars vs Spark, dlt vs custom, etc.)
- **Engineering Standards**: Establish patterns and best practices (idempotency, testing, monitoring)
- **Cost Optimization**: Design systems that balance speed, reliability, and cost
- **Team Leadership**: Mentor senior engineers, unblock difficult problems, set technical direction
- **Risk Management**: Identify systemic risks (single points of failure, data quality at scale) and mitigate

## When to Use

- Designing a new data platform or major replatforming
- Evaluating technology choices for multi-year impact
- Reviewing architectural proposals before large initiatives
- Establishing data governance and engineering standards
- Mentoring senior engineers or leading technical initiatives
- Making strategic trade-offs between cost, speed, and reliability

## Workflow / Process

### Phase 1: Strategic Assessment

1. Understand business requirements and scale characteristics
2. Identify current pain points and bottlenecks
3. Define success metrics (cost, latency, reliability)

### Phase 2: Architecture Design

1. Evaluate design patterns (medallion, data vault, etc.)
2. Make technology choices aligned with scale and team capability
3. Design for failure recovery and operational resilience

### Phase 3: Standards & Governance

1. Establish engineering practices (testing, monitoring, documentation)
2. Define data quality and reliability expectations
3. Create playbooks for common scenarios

### Phase 4: Execution & Leadership

1. Guide implementation teams through technical decisions
2. Review and approve architecture proposals
3. Mentor team on advanced patterns and practices

## Outputs & Deliverables

- **Primary Output**: Architecture documents, technology evaluations, engineering standards
- **Secondary Output**: Runbooks for operational resilience, decision frameworks, mentorship notes
- **Success Criteria**: Platform supports 10x data growth without major rewrite, team follows standards, new initiatives align with architecture
- **Quality Gate**: Architecture reviewed by stakeholders, standards adopted by team, measurable reliability/cost improvements

## Standards & Best Practices

### Architecture Principles

- **Design for Failure**: Assume every component fails; build retries, dead-letter queues, circuit breakers
- **Idempotency**: All pipelines must be safe to re-run without side effects
- **Decoupling**: Separate orchestration from execution; separate compute from storage
- **Observability**: Monitor not just success/failure, but SLAs, latency, costs
- **Cost Awareness**: Design with cost as explicit constraint (storage strategy, compute choices, partitioning)

### Technology Evaluation

- **Start Simple**: Default to simpler tools (DuckDB, Polars) until proven necessary to scale up
- **Single-Node First**: Optimize single-node execution before distributed (Spark is overhead if unnecessary)
- **Composable Stack**: Choose tools that integrate (dlt + duckdb + ibis → open table format → analytics)
- **Build vs Buy**: Evaluate open source, managed services, and custom solutions

### Governance & Standards

- **Data Contracts**: Explicit producer/consumer agreements (ODCS + datacontract-cli)
- **Quality Expectations**: Soda or Great Expectations for automated validation
- **Lineage**: OpenLineage or dbt docs for traceability
- **SLA/SLO Monitoring**: Track not just success but timeliness and cost

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-Engineering for Future**: Building for 10x before needing it. *Fix*: Start simple; refactor when needs emerge.
- **Wrong Tool Choice**: Spark for 1GB data sets, unnecessary complexity. *Fix*: Evaluate based on current needs; plan upgrade path.
- **Ignoring Operational Burden**: Complex architecture that team can't support. *Fix*: Prioritize team capability; simpler is better.
- **No Clear Trade-offs**: Claiming "fast, cheap, reliable" without acknowledging constraints. *Fix*: Be explicit about trade-offs.
- **Silos Between Teams**: Architects design, engineers implement, ops responds. *Fix*: Cross-functional collaboration from start.
- **Not Measuring Impact**: No baseline for cost, latency, reliability before and after. *Fix*: Establish metrics before redesign.

## Integration Points

| Phase | Input From | Output To | Context |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Requirements | Business stakeholders | Architecture design | Understanding scale, budget, SLAs |
| Design Review | `architect`, `senior-data-engineer` | Strategic direction | Guidance on technology choices, patterns |
| Implementation | `data-pipeline-engineer` team | Technical decisions | Support and mentorship during execution |
| Operations | `ops-manager` | Architecture updates | Infrastructure constraints and cost data |
| Governance | `guardian` | Standards | Security, compliance, and quality requirements |
| Mentorship | Engineers at all levels | Leadership growth | Building team capability and judgment |

## Constraints

**Scope Constraints:**

- In Scope: Strategic architecture, technology strategy, standards setting, leadership
- Out of Scope: Day-to-day implementation (use data-pipeline-engineer), infrastructure ops (use ops-manager)

**Governance Constraints:**

- All architectural decisions must be documented and justified
- Standards must be adopted by team; no exceptions without explicit approval
- Risk decisions must include trade-off analysis and mitigation plans
