# Spark Optimization - Performance Tuning

## Overview

The Spark Optimization skill focuses on diagnosing and fixing performance bottlenecks in Apache Spark jobs. This is a specialized, deep-focus skill for when you have a Spark job that's slow, consuming too much memory, or not scaling efficiently.

Use this skill when:

- A Spark job exceeds its SLA or budget
- You need to debug why a job is slower than expected
- You're optimizing for large-scale data processing
- Shuffles, skew, or memory pressure are causing failures
- You need to choose between partitioning strategies or join algorithms

## Core Capabilities

- **Performance Profiling**: Read Spark UI, identify bottlenecks (shuffle, GC, serialization, I/O)
- **Partitioning Optimization**: Right-size partitions, implement skew handling, partition pruning
- **Join Optimization**: Choose between broadcast, sort-merge, and bucket joins based on data characteristics
- **Memory Tuning**: Optimize executor memory, cache strategy, and GC behavior
- **Serialization**: Configure Kryo, choose columnar formats for large data
- **Caching Strategy**: Identify what to cache, when to cache, and when to spill

## When to Use

## Workflow / Process

### Phase 1: Diagnosis

1. Enable Spark UI and run job to completion
2. Analyze executor usage, task durations, and shuffle size
3. Identify bottleneck: CPU, memory, I/O, or scheduling

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis

1. Check for data skew (uneven task durations)
2. Review join strategy (broadcast vs sort-merge vs bucket)
3. Analyze partition count and size
4. Evaluate serialization and format choices

### Phase 3: Optimization

1. Apply targeted fix (e.g., repartition, broadcast join, caching)
2. Measure impact: runtime, memory, cost
3. Iterate if improvements insufficient

### Phase 4: Validation

1. Test with production data volume and characteristics
2. Monitor side effects (new bottlenecks, memory pressure)
3. Document optimization in runbook for future engineers

## Constraints

**Technical Constraints:**

- Cannot fundamentally change data or algorithm (that's architect/pipeline-engineer role)
- Optimizations must not sacrifice correctness or data consistency

**Scope Constraints:**

- In Scope: Spark configuration tuning, query optimization, serialization, caching strategy
- Out of Scope: Infrastructure provisioning, algorithm redesign, non-Spark systems

## Reference Examples

See `examples/` directory for:

- Partitioning strategies and skew handling
- Join algorithm comparisons (broadcast, sort-merge, bucket)
- Memory tuning and caching patterns
- Serialization and format optimization
- Detailed Spark UI analysis walkthroughs

- 1.0 (2026-01-24): Spark-focused optimization skill

    skew_ratio = stats["max"] / stats["avg"]
    print(f"Skew ratio: {skew_ratio:.2f}x (>2x indicates skew)")

```

## Configuration Cheat Sheet

```python
# Production configuration template
spark_configs = {
    # Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)
    "spark.sql.adaptive.enabled": "true",
    "spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled": "true",
    "spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled": "true",

    # Memory
    "spark.executor.memory": "8g",
    "spark.executor.memoryOverhead": "2g",
    "spark.memory.fraction": "0.6",
    "spark.memory.storageFraction": "0.5",

    # Parallelism
    "spark.sql.shuffle.partitions": "200",
    "spark.default.parallelism": "200",

    # Serialization
    "spark.serializer": "org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer",
    "spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled": "true",

    # Compression
    "spark.io.compression.codec": "lz4",
    "spark.shuffle.compress": "true",

    # Broadcast
    "spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold": "50MB",

    # File handling
    "spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes": "128MB",
    "spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes": "4MB",
}
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Enable AQE** - Adaptive query execution handles many issues
- **Use Parquet/Delta** - Columnar formats with compression
- **Broadcast small tables** - Avoid shuffle for small joins
- **Monitor Spark UI** - Check for skew, spills, GC
- **Right-size partitions** - 128MB - 256MB per partition

### Don'ts

- **Don't collect large data** - Keep data distributed
- **Don't use UDFs unnecessarily** - Use built-in functions
- **Don't over-cache** - Memory is limited
- **Don't ignore data skew** - It dominates job time
- **Don't use `.count()` for existence** - Use `.take(1)` or `.isEmpty()`
