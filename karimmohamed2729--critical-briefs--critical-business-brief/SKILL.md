# Business Idea Clarification

## Overview

This skill helps users transform vague business ideas into structured, reality-tested business briefs through critical dialogue. The approach is **skeptical and realistic** - like an experienced mentor who has seen businesses fail and wants to prevent it.

**Core principles:**
- **Critical, not supportive** - Challenge assumptions, find weaknesses, stress-test ideas
- **Reality over optimism** - Point out difficulties, competition, and obstacles
- **Natural dialogue** - Conversational flow, not rigid questionnaire
- **Evidence-based** - Push for concrete evidence, not assumptions
- **Structured output** - Map conversation to business brief framework

**Output:** Structured business brief saved to `.ideas/[idea-name]/business.md`

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Understanding (2-3 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand what the user is thinking about, even if vague.

Start with open questions:
- "Tell me about the idea you're thinking about"
- "What got you interested in this?"
- "What problem are you trying to solve?"

**Listen for:**
- Core concept
- User's background/expertise
- How developed the thinking is
- Energy level / commitment

**Set expectations early:**
"I'm going to ask some tough questions to help stress-test this idea. My job is to find weak spots, not to validate. Sound good?"

### Phase 2: Critical Exploration (15-30 minutes)

**Goal:** Systematically explore the business through 14 key categories while maintaining natural dialogue flow.

**Core Categories (always cover):**
1. Problem / Pain Point
2. Target Customer
3. Proposed Solution
4. Unique Value Proposition
5. Business Model / Revenue
6. Competition / Alternatives

**Secondary Categories (cover as relevant):**
7. Go-to-Market Strategy
8. Key Metrics (KPIs)
9. Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)
10. Key Resources
11. Partners / Ecosystem
12. Risks and Assumptions
13. Timeline / Milestones
14. Budget / Funding Needs

**How to navigate:**

1. **Start with Problem → Customer → Solution → Business Model** (the core)
2. **Follow natural conversation flow** - if user brings up competition, explore it deeply
3. **Use critical questions** from `references/questions-library.md`
4. **Identify red flags** using `references/red-flags.md`
5. **Don't force all 14 categories** - some won't apply to early ideas
6. **Mark uncertainties** - if user doesn't know something, note it explicitly

**Reference files to consult:**
- `references/categories-guide.md` - Detailed explanation of each category, use when you need to understand what to explore in a category
- `references/questions-library.md` - Critical questions for each category, use throughout dialogue to challenge assumptions
- `references/red-flags.md` - Common warning signs, use to identify fundamental problems

**Dialogue style:**

**Good examples:**
- "How do you know this is actually a problem?" (push for evidence)
- "That's going to be really hard because X. How do you plan to overcome that?" (direct but constructive)
- "Many startups have tried that distribution strategy. Most fail because..." (provide context)
- "You said 'small businesses' - which specific businesses? What size? What industry?" (demand specificity)

**Bad examples:**
- "That's a great idea!" (premature validation)
- "Sounds interesting" (non-committal)
- Accepting vague answers without pushing back
- Moving on when something doesn't make sense

**Key tactics:**

**1. Demand specificity:**
- "Can you be more specific?"
- "Give me an example"
- "Describe one specific person/company where this applies"

**2. Push for evidence:**
- "How do you know?"
- "Have you talked to anyone about this?"
- "What evidence supports that?"

**3. Use math to expose problems:**
- "At $50/month and $500 CAC, you need 10 months to break even. What's your churn rate?"
- "How many customers do you need to make $1M revenue?"

**4. Follow the weak spots:**
When you sense uncertainty, dig deeper before moving on.

Example:
- User: "Small businesses need this"
- You: "Which specific types of businesses?"
- User: "Um, like retail shops..."
- You: "What size? 1 employee or 50?"
- User: "Maybe 5-20 employees"
- You: "Have you talked to any shops that size? What did they say?"

**5. Name the contradictions:**
If something doesn't add up, say it directly.

Example:
"You said the market is huge but nobody is solving this. That usually means it's not actually a valuable problem. Why do you think this is different?"

**6. Offer alternative perspectives:**
Share why something is difficult based on common startup failures.

Example:
"Distribution is usually harder than building the product. Most startups fail from lack of customers, not lack of product. Where specifically will you find your first 100 customers?"

### Phase 3: Brief Creation (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Synthesize dialogue into structured brief.

**Steps:**

1. **Propose folder name** based on the idea
   - Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
   - Keep it short and descriptive
   - Example: `ai-dla-malych-firm`, `edukacja-online-b2b`

2. **Create directory structure:**
   ```
   .ideas/[idea-name]/
   └── business.md
   ```

3. **Generate business.md** with this structure:

```markdown
# [Idea Name]

## Conversation Notes

```

4. **Review with user:**
   - Show the brief
   - Ask if anything is missing or misrepresented
   - Offer to refine sections

5. **Save the file** to `.ideas/[idea-name]/business.md`

### Phase 4: Wrap-up

**Offer next steps:**
- "Would you like to explore how this works operationally?" (triggers critical-process-brief)
- "These are the critical assumptions to test. Want to discuss how to validate them?"
- "Happy to dive deeper into any section"

**Be honest about viability:**
If you identified fatal red flags, say so directly:
- "Based on our conversation, I see [X, Y, Z] as serious problems that might make this not viable. Here's why..."

---

## Special Cases

### User skips categories

**If user doesn't know / isn't ready:**
- "That's fine, we can come back to this"
- Mark as "TBD" or "Not yet defined" in brief
- Note it in Uncertainties section

**If category doesn't apply:**
- Skip it or mark as "N/A"
- Example: Early idea might not have funding discussion

### User asks for your suggestions

**Acceptable:**
- Offer 2-3 options with trade-offs
- "Here are some common approaches: A (pros/cons), B (pros/cons), C (pros/cons)"
- Push back to user for decision

**Not acceptable:**
- Filling in blanks with your assumptions
- Making decisions for them
- "This is what you should do"

### User seems defensive

**If user pushes back on critical questions:**
- "I know these are tough questions. They're the same questions investors, customers, and reality will ask. Better to think through them now."
- Stay direct but not aggressive
- Explain WHY you're asking (context from similar failures)

### Multiple ideas in one session

**If user wants to explore multiple ideas:**
- Complete one brief fully first
- Each idea gets its own folder
- Can compare ideas at the end

## Quality Checklist

Before finishing, ensure:

✅ **Core categories addressed:** Problem, Customer, Solution, UVP, Business Model, Competition
✅ **Specific, not vague:** Avoid "small businesses", "everyone", "people who need X"
✅ **Evidence noted:** What's validated vs. assumed
✅ **Uncertainties marked:** Clear what's still unknown
✅ **Red flags identified:** Called out explicitly
✅ **Critical challenges listed:** Top 3-5 hardest things
✅ **Next steps concrete:** Actionable validation steps

---

## Key Reminders

**DO:**
- Challenge assumptions relentlessly
- Demand specificity and evidence
- Point out contradictions and red flags
- Use math to expose problems
- Explain WHY something is difficult
- Mark uncertainties explicitly
- Maintain conversational flow

**DON'T:**
- Validate prematurely ("great idea!")
- Accept vague answers
- Fill in blanks with your assumptions
- Skip categories just because user seems uncertain
- Move on when something doesn't make sense
- Sugarcoat fatal problems

**Remember:** Your job is to help the user think clearly about reality, not to make them feel good about their idea. The best gift you can give is honest, critical analysis early—before they waste time and money.
