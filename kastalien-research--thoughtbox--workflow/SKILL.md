Orchestrate the development workflow for: $ARGUMENTS

## Overview

You are the **workflow conductor**. You sequence 8 stages, enforce gates between them, dispatch to stage skills, and maintain a state file. You do NOT perform stage-specific work yourself — you delegate to the appropriate skill or sub-agent at each stage.

## Stages and Dispatch

| # | Stage | Skill/Command | Gate (must pass before advancing) |
|---|-------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1 | Ideation | `/workflow-ideation` | User confirms proceed (question 3d is not "confident no") |
| 2 | Dev-Time Docs | `/hdd --phases=1-2` | Spec exists in `specs/`, ADR exists in `.adr/staging/` |
| 3 | Planning | `/workflows-plan` | Plan file exists and user has approved it |
| 4 | Implementation | `/workflows-work` | All sub-agent summaries persisted to disk, all tests pass |
| 5 | Review | `/workflows-review` | All claims verified, no blocking findings |
| 6 | Revision | `/workflow-revision` | Review passes OR max iterations reached + user accepts |
| 7 | Compound | `/workflows-compound` | Learning captured |
| 8 | Reflection | `/workflow-reflection` | ADR moved, issues closed, branch merged or marked ready |

## Initialization

When invoked, first check for an existing workflow state:

```bash
cat .workflow/state.json 2>/dev/null
```

**If state exists and is not completed**: Resume from `currentStage`. Show the dashboard and ask the user whether to continue or restart.

**If no state exists**: Initialize a new workflow:

1. Generate a short ID: `workflow-$(date +%s | tail -c 5)`
2. Create or confirm the feature branch (per AGENTS.md branch rules)
3. Write the initial state file (see State Schema below)
4. Begin at Stage 1: Ideation

## State Schema

Write to `.workflow/state.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "workflow-<short-id>",
  "title": "<feature name from $ARGUMENTS>",
  "branch": "<type>/<branch-name>",
  "startedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "updatedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "currentStage": "ideation",
  "stages": {
    "ideation": { "status": "pending", "completedAt": null, "notes": "" },
    "dev-docs": { "status": "pending", "artifacts": { "spec": null, "adr": null } },
    "planning": { "status": "pending", "artifacts": { "plan": null } },
    "implementation": { "status": "pending", "artifacts": { "summaries": [], "issues": [] } },
    "review": { "status": "pending", "artifacts": { "findings": [] } },
    "revision": { "status": "pending", "iterations": 0, "maxIterations": 3 },
    "compound": { "status": "pending", "artifacts": { "solution": null } },
    "reflection": { "status": "pending" }
  }
}
```

## Stage Execution Protocol

For each stage:

1. **Update state**: Set `currentStage` and stage status to `"in_progress"`, update `updatedAt`
2. **Show dashboard** (see Dashboard section below)
3. **Dispatch**: Invoke the stage skill/command
4. **Check gate**: Verify the gate conditions for the current stage
5. **Record artifacts**: Update the stage's `artifacts` in state with file paths
6. **Advance**: Set stage status to `"completed"` with `completedAt`, move `currentStage` to next stage
7. **Loop**: Return to step 1 for the next stage

### Gate Enforcement

If a gate condition is not met after the stage skill returns:

- Tell the user which gate conditions failed and why
- Ask whether to retry the stage or skip (with acknowledgment of risk)
- Do NOT silently advance past a failed gate

### Stage Transitions with Special Logic

**Stage 4 → 5 (Implementation → Review)**: Before dispatching review, run the between-stage check:
```bash
git fetch origin && git log origin/main --oneline -5
```
If `main` has advanced, classify the conflict (no overlap / mechanical / semantic) before proceeding.

**Stage 5 → 6 (Review → Revision)**: Only enter Revision if review found issues. If review is clean, skip directly to Stage 7 (Compound).

**Stage 6 → 5 (Revision loop)**: Revision dispatches back to Review. This loop continues until review passes or `maxIterations` (3) is reached.

## Sub-Agent Structured Output Format

When dispatching implementation sub-agents (Stage 4), each must return its summary in this format. Persist each summary to disk immediately upon receipt:

```markdown
## Sub-Agent Work Summary

### Task
- Branch: <current branch>
- Spec: specs/<spec-file>.md
- ADR: .adr/staging/<adr-file>.md (if applicable)

### Changes
- Files modified: [list with paths]
- Files created: [list with paths]
- Files deleted: [list with paths]
- Lines: +N / -N

### Claims
Specific, testable statements about what the implementation does.
Review sub-agents verify these claims rather than reading all the code.

1. "[Function/module X] handles [case Y] by [doing Z]"
   - Verifiable by: [test name or command]
2. "[Component A] now [behaves in way B] when [condition C]"
   - Verifiable by: [test name or command]

### Hypothesis Alignment
For each ADR hypothesis that this unit of work touches:

- H1 "[hypothesis text]": [SUPPORTS | REFUTES | NO EVIDENCE] -- [brief evidence]
- H2 "...": ...

### Tests
- Tests written: N
- Tests passing: N/N
- Commands: `[exact test command to reproduce]`
- Coverage: [files/functions covered by tests]

### Known Gaps
- [anything not completed, deferred, or uncertain]
- [any divergence from spec with justification]

### Accepted ADR Conflicts
- [any previously accepted ADR whose reasoning is contradicted or undermined by this work]
- [leave empty if none found]

### Risks
- [anything that could break other parts of the system]
- [any assumptions made that should be verified]
```

Save summaries to: `.adr/staging/<NNN>-<name>-summary.md`

## Operational Rules

1. **1 sub-agent = 1 commit**: Each sub-agent's unit of work is exactly one commit, made after review validates the work — not during implementation.
2. **Summaries to disk**: Persist sub-agent summaries immediately. Without this, orchestrator crashes lose all work.
3. **Orchestrators delegate**: You do NOT read implementation code or write production code. You dispatch sub-agents and validate their summaries.
4. **Atomic commits**: The commit includes both code changes AND any spec updates in the same commit.
5. **Conventional commits**: All commits follow `<type>[scope]: <description>` format.

## Dashboard

After each stage transition, render this dashboard:

```
WORKFLOW: <title>
Branch: <branch>
Started: <startedAt>

Stage                 Status        Artifacts
-------               ------        ---------
1. Ideation           [status]      [notes excerpt]
2. Dev-Time Docs      [status]      spec: [path], adr: [path]
3. Planning           [status]      plan: [path]
4. Implementation     [status]      summaries: N, issues: N
5. Review             [status]      findings: N
6. Revision           [status]      iterations: N/3
7. Compound           [status]      [solution path]
8. Reflection         [status]

Current: Stage N - <stage name>
Next action: <what to do next>
```

Status symbols: `[ ]` pending, `[~]` in_progress, `[x]` completed, `[-]` skipped

## Completion

When Stage 8 (Reflection) completes:
1. Set all stage statuses to reflect final state
2. Update `updatedAt`
3. Report the final dashboard
4. The state file remains for archaeological reference but is gitignored

## Error Recovery

If you are resuming a workflow after a crash or context loss:
1. Read `.workflow/state.json` to determine where you were
2. Check for persisted summaries: `ls .adr/staging/*-summary-*.md`
3. Check working tree: `git status`
4. Determine which recovery case applies (see WMD incident response) and resume accordingly

## Reference

The rationale, failure modes, and detailed process descriptions that inform this workflow are documented in `docs/WORKFLOW-MASTER-DESCRIPTION.md`. Consult it when you need to understand WHY a rule exists, not just WHAT the rule is.
