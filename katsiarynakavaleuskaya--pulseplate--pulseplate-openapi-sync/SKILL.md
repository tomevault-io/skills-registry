# PulsePlate OpenAPI Sync

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

## When to use

- Backend schema or route contracts changed.
- Frontend API types are stale or mismatched.
- PR includes API contract updates.

## Inputs required

- Target branch/base for diff comparison.
- Confirmation that backend app imports successfully.
- Whether frontend build/test should be run after sync.

## Procedure (commands)

1. Generate canonical OpenAPI:

   ```bash
   make openapi
   ```

2. Verify OpenAPI determinism and checks:

   ```bash
   make openapi-check
   pytest tests/test_openapi_determinism.py
   ```

3. Regenerate frontend types:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run generate-types
   cd ..
   ```

4. Inspect resulting diff:

   ```bash
   git status --short
   git diff -- frontend/src/api/openapi.json frontend/src/api/schema.ts
   ```

5. Validate frontend compile/test path:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm test
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```

## Output format

- `Regeneration status`: openapi/types commands with exit codes.
- `Changed artifacts`: list changed contract files.
- `Contract notes`: notable API shape changes.
- `Validation`: frontend test/build outcome.
- `Rerun commands`: exact commands for reviewers.

Include on failure:

- Raw failing lines.
- `file:line:error` pointers.
- Minimal fix steps.

## Guardrails

- Do not edit generated files manually.
- Do not skip type regeneration after OpenAPI changes.
- Do not merge API contract changes without frontend validation.
- Keep backend schema generation on canonical entrypoint only.
- Always run `make openapi-check` and `pytest tests/test_openapi_determinism.py` before merge.
