# Chrome DevTools (MCP)

Use this skill when you need browser-grounded evidence (UI screenshots, console errors, network failures, perf traces) or when a task requires real page interaction.

## Preflight

- Ensure the MCP server is configured: `codex-orchestrator devtools setup --yes`.
- If tools are missing in the current run, enable the server and restart the run:
  - `codex -c 'mcp_servers.chrome-devtools.enabled=true' ...`

## Default Workflow

1. Open a new page and navigate to the target URL.
2. Wait for the page to be stable (avoid racing async renders).
3. Interact with the UI (click/fill/press) to reproduce the behavior.
4. Collect evidence:
   - Screenshot(s) for visual state
   - Console messages for runtime errors
   - Network requests for failed/slow calls
5. Close pages when finished.

## Evidence Discipline

- Always capture at least one screenshot when validating UI behavior.
- When debugging, always include:
  - `list_console_messages`
  - `list_network_requests` (and fetch details for failures)

## Related skills

- `standalone-review`: route ad-hoc review checks through a manifest-backed review loop when findings need auditability.
- `collab-subagents-first`: isolate heavy browser exploration in a dedicated subagent stream to protect parent context.
- `frontend-design-review`: optional global skill (not bundled in CO release); use when the task emphasis is structured UI/UX critique with evidence-backed recommendations.
- `long-poll-wait`: monitor long-running browser-driven checks or CI replay loops to terminal state.
