# Sync with Remote

Fetches from origin and integrates changes from a source branch. Automatically chooses rebase (for unpushed branches) or merge (for pushed branches) strategy.

## Usage

```
/bkff:git-sync [source-branch]
```

## Strategy Selection

| Condition | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Branch not pushed to origin | Rebase (clean history) |
| Branch already pushed to origin | Merge (preserve history) |

## Example Output

```
## Sync Complete (Rebase)

### Fetch
- ✓ Fetched from origin

### Strategy
- **Mode**: Rebase (branch not yet pushed)
- **Source**: main

### Result
- **Status**: Up to date with main
```

## Requirements

- Must be run inside a git worktree
- `git` CLI with rerere enabled recommended
- No uncommitted changes

## Implementation

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
PLUGIN_DIR="$(dirname "$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")")"
source "$PLUGIN_DIR/lib/common.sh"
