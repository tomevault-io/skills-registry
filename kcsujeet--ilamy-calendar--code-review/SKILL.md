# Code Review

Review a pull request or local diff thoroughly, draft findings as Conventional Comments anchored to specific lines, and present the draft to the user. Never post to GitHub without explicit approval.

## Hard Rules

These are non-negotiable. Violating any of these is a defect in the review.

- **Never post to GitHub before the user says to post.** Showing the draft is not approval; "looks good" is not approval. Wait for explicit "post it" or equivalent.
- **Decide yourself whether a comment needs a decoration at all.** Most don't. Only ask the user about the choice of decoration (`blocking` vs `non-blocking` vs `if-minor`) for the small subset where one is actually needed AND severity is genuinely ambiguous. Never silently add `(blocking)` yourself.
- **Never use em dashes (—).** Use periods, commas, parentheses, or rewrite. The user has corrected this multiple times. This applies to the chat reply you send the user too, not only the posted comment.
- **Never add pleasantries or preamble.** No "well-scoped PR", "nice work", "tests pass" summaries. The inline comments speak for themselves. The reader can see the PR is well-scoped without being told.
- **No movie-narration prose. Plain language only.** Phrases like "demonstrably closed", "worth shipping on its own", "a real bug fix", "the locale-on-mount fix is a real bug fix worth shipping" are corporate filler the user has called "cringy" and "robotic". Direct: "fixes the bug", "right fix", "broken". Read the draft aloud. If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it.
- **Never add a top-level review body unless it says something the inline comments do not already say.** Summary lines like "All N issues are closed and the X fix is correct" only restate inlines. Even when the GitHub API requires a body (e.g. `REQUEST_CHANGES`), the rule is: either the body adds unique structural context (workflow feedback, "this PR is stacked on #N"), or you skip the review wrapper entirely and post individual inline comments via `/pulls/{N}/comments`.
- **Never make claims about external APIs from cached knowledge.** Before citing behavior of dayjs, rrule, React, Intl, Tailwind, or any other library, WebFetch the canonical docs and cite the source inline. Past sessions shipped fabricated method names.
- **Never make the review about pre-existing problems.** Flag them once briefly if they intersect the change, then move on. The PR author didn't write that code.
- **Never create follow-up commits on the user's behalf during review.** If the user asks for fixes after the review, make them but ask before committing.
- **Trust but verify.** When a sub-agent says "line 42 has a bug", open line 42 and confirm before putting it in the draft.
- **When you flag one instance of a pattern, scan the diff for the same pattern elsewhere.** If you call out a useless `useMemo` in one file, grep the diff for other `useMemo` blocks and check each. If you call out a manual `Intl`-based helper, look for siblings. The user explicitly asked "look for other such options" when a single instance was flagged and other instances existed nearby.
- **Treat author defiance of a prior review as blocking.** If the prior review explicitly asked the author to remove or refactor pattern X, and the new revision renamed or relocated pattern X instead of removing it, that is still the same architectural issue. Flag it as `(blocking)` and reference the prior review comment.

## Phase 0: Scope Check

Before reading the diff for content, check the structure. Two problems are common in this repo's PRs and need to be surfaced before drafting line-level comments:

### Stacked branches

Run `gh pr list --author <author> --state open --json number,headRefName` to see the author's other open PRs. If multiple PRs exist and the diff for the current PR has 30+ files, the branches are probably stacked on top of each other rather than branched off `main`. Confirm by checking commits:

```bash
gh pr view <N> --json commits -q '.commits | length'
gh pr view <N-1> --json commits -q '.commits | length'
```

If PR N includes most of PR N-1's commits, the branches are stacked. **Stop and flag this to the user before drafting line-level reviews.** A stacked branch's diff cannot be reviewed in isolation. Suggest one of: (a) ask author to rebase each branch off main, (b) post a per-PR one-liner explaining the problem, or (c) close and reopen.

### Title vs. scope mismatch

Read the PR title against the diff. If the title says "fix X" but the diff also rewrites Y, deletes public-API surface area, or introduces a new abstraction unrelated to X, that is out-of-scope. Flag it. The right move is to ask the author to split the PR, not to silently review a scope-creep PR as if the title were honest.

Examples of out-of-scope you've seen in this repo:
- "Fix missing translations" that also removes 38 public translation keys and rewrites the date-formatting layer with `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
- Bug-fix PRs that also delete unrelated dev logs.
- Single-fix PRs that also bundle a feature flag, a new prop, or a refactor.

When you find this, your draft becomes: "this PR is doing 4 things; the original problem is fixed by commits A and B; commits C-D should be split into PR #2; commit E into PR #3."

## Phase 1: Gather the Diff

Determine the review target from the user's request:

- **PR number or URL** → `gh pr view <N> --json title,body,state,author,files,commits,headRefOid` plus `gh pr diff <N>`. Save `headRefOid` (you need it later for inline comments).
- **Local changes** → `git diff` or `git diff main...HEAD`.
- **Specific commit** → `git show <sha>`.

If the diff is large (>35KB), save to a file and read it with `Read` using offset/limit. Don't skim. Actually read the changed lines.

Read the surrounding context of any non-trivial change. A diff hunk alone hides what was removed or why a field exists. Open the full file when the hunk touches shared components, context, or public APIs.

For PRs, also read the linked issue (`gh issue view <N>`). Issues often contain constraints ("no public-API changes", "must work for X") that the PR may have silently violated.

## Phase 2: Review in Parallel

For diffs >300 lines or >5 files, spawn three `Explore` agents in a single message. For smaller diffs, do this inline. Each agent gets the full diff so they work from the same source.

### Agent 1: Bugs & Correctness

- **Logic bugs**: off-by-one, wrong operator, inverted conditions, stale state.
- **Leftover code**: duplicate JSX from incomplete refactors, dead imports, props threaded through that aren't used.
- **Breaking changes**: modified shared components, changed prop shapes, removed exports. Grep for who imports them. Removing or making-required a field on a public type is a breaking change even if the PR description says it isn't.
- **Data shape mismatches**: API contract drift, type assertions that hide real errors.
- **Edge cases**: empty arrays, null/undefined, timezone issues. This codebase uses dayjs with a configured `timezone` prop. `Intl.DateTimeFormat` without a `timeZone` option formats in the system timezone, which is wrong for this calendar. The previous fix is documented in `docs/logs/2026-03-29.md` style entries.
- **Regressions of previously-fixed bugs**: check if the dev logs (`docs/logs/`) describe a fix that this PR re-introduces. Don't trust the PR author's description; check the logs.

### Agent 2: Simplification Opportunities

**DRY is the guiding principle here.** Actively hunt for repetition: any time the same shape of code (same boilerplate in tests, same condition, same JSX wrapper, same setup block) appears 2-3+ times, propose extracting it. Repetition is the single most common review finding and the easiest to undervalue. Look for it everywhere: production code, tests, demo code, documentation snippets. Test files in particular accumulate repetitive setup that begs for helpers like `renderXyzView`, `buildEvent`, `at(hour, minute)`.

Specific patterns to flag:

- **Repeated test setup**: multiple tests calling the same `render(<Provider>...<X /></Provider>)` boilerplate with one varying prop. Extract a `renderX(overrides?)` helper.
- **Scope creep**: props added to shared components for a single use case. Should it live closer to the caller instead?
- **Repeated inline checks**: the same condition appearing 3+ times. Extract to a boolean const.
- **Over-parameterized components**: 6+ props where 4 could be derived from context.
- **Duplicate computation** across sibling components. Extract to a shared hook.
- **Repeated `locale = currentLocale || currentDate.locale()`-style patterns** across multiple files. Extract to a small hook so future changes (like adding `timeZone`) are one-line.
- **Template literal classNames** where `cn()` is the codebase convention.
- **JSX blocks** >30 lines that could be standalone components.
- **Useless wrapper divs** that duplicate parent styling.
- **Over-engineering relative to alternatives**: if the PR introduces a custom utility module (e.g., `formatLocaleDate.ts`) when a one-line plugin call would do (`dayjs.extend(localizedFormat)` + `format('LL')`), call it out with the comparison. Verify both produce identical output before claiming equivalence. **For every new helper function in the diff, ask: "what does this do that the underlying library / plugin / standard token does not already do?"** If the answer is "nothing meaningful" or "a stylistic preference", recommend deleting it.
- **Useless `useMemo` blocks**. Two common shapes to flag:
  - **Empty deps + no inputs from component scope.** It's a module constant in disguise. Move it out of the component as a top-level `const`.
  - **Deps that change every render** (e.g. `[currentDate]` where `currentDate` updates on every navigation, or `[firstDayOfWeek]` where the body is 7 cheap dayjs ops). The cache never hits, the hook bookkeeping costs more than the work. Drop the memo, inline the expression.
  - When you suggest dropping a `useMemo`, the comment must include a brief reason: "empty deps", "deps change every render", "7 cheap ops, no benefit", etc. Do not just say "drop the useMemo" without explaining why.

The goal is not zealous deduplication. Three similar lines is sometimes better than a premature abstraction. But when the same shape appears with no real variance, name it once.

### Agent 3: Code Quality & Efficiency

- **Project conventions** (defined in `.agents/rules/code-style.md` and `.agents/rules/coding-patterns.md`):
  - `.at(0)` / `.at(-1)` over `[0]` / `[length - 1]` for first/last array access.
  - No `!` non-null assertions. Use guards, optional chaining, or default values.
  - `Boolean(x)` over `!!x` for coercion.
  - No `any`. Use `unknown` with type guards, specific interfaces, or generics.
  - No `export default`. Named exports only.
  - For `cn(...)` with multi-clause conditions, extract each conditional class to a named const, don't inline.
- **Readability conventions** (the user has stated these explicitly; reviews should flag violations):
  - **Colocation (Bulletproof React).** Tests live next to components (`foo.tsx` + `foo.test.tsx`). Hooks and utils live with the feature that owns them. Shared code sits at the lowest common ancestor in the tree. A PR that moves a feature-specific util into a global `lib/` should be questioned.
  - **Named variables over inline expressions.** When a condition has 2+ clauses (`a && b && c`), extract to a named const that describes what the combined condition represents. Example: `const canShowFeature = featureAvailable && featureEnabled && !userOptedOut` then `if (canShowFeature)`. Flag inline multi-clause conditions in `if`, `&&` JSX gates, ternary tests, and `cn(...)` calls.
  - **No multi-level ternaries.** Single-level ternaries are fine (`isActive ? 'on' : 'off'`). Two or more nested levels (`a ? b : c ? d : e`) are not. Suggest converting to `if/else if/else`, early returns, or a key-value lookup object.
  - **No nested `if` or `switch` blocks.** Suggest flattening with early returns, guard variables, or key-value object lookups. Nested control flow is almost always a sign that the logic can be expressed more clearly.
  - **No ternaries in JSX.** Prefer single-level boolean conditionals (`{condition && <X />}`) or early returns from the component. `{isLoading ? <Spinner /> : <Content />}` should become an early return for the loading branch or two consecutive `&&` gates.
  - **No code the reader can't understand at a glance.** If a line takes more than a few seconds to parse, that is a defect, not cleverness. A comment explaining mechanics is a smell; rewrite the code instead. Comments should explain WHY, not WHAT.
  - **Don't prop-drill what context already provides.** If a hook, function, or component already has access to a value via context (e.g. `useSmartCalendarContext`, `useEffectiveBusinessHours`), it should read it there directly instead of accepting it as a prop or argument and having every caller plumb it through. Flag any case where a caller pulls a value out of context only to pass it back into a callee that could pull it itself. Same rule for refs, settings, callbacks, and any other context-derived data. Tests can wrap the callee in a minimal provider.
- **Unnecessary work**: `useMemo` / loops that run in modes where the result is unused. Guard with `if (!isActive) return []`.
- **Missed memoization**: inline object/callback creation inside `useMemo` deps that breaks child memoization.
- **Stale deps**: function refs used in dep arrays instead of the underlying data.
- **Redundant recomputation**: a value already memoized by a shared hook being recomputed inline.
- **Repeated call shapes inside a memo** with only one argument varying: extract to a `useCallback` and invoke at each site.
- **Conditional memos that throw away cached work**: `useMemo(() => flag ? A() : B(), [...allDeps])` recomputes on every change. Split into two memos with narrower deps + a tiny selector.
- **Test coverage gaps**: new prop or feature added without tests. Tests that assert CSS classes (brittle in JSDOM).
- **Integration test gaps for gating logic**: if a feature is gated on a condition (e.g., `gridType === 'hour'`), there should be a test that the feature mounts under the condition and not otherwise. Component-level tests in isolation don't catch a regressed gate.
- **Naming**: file name must uniquely identify the file across the whole codebase. `day-header.tsx` inside `resource-calendar/components/week-view/horizontal/` is wrong (too generic without path context). Use `resource-week-horizontal-day-header.tsx`. Names appear path-less in IDE tabs, grep, imports, stack traces.
- **Unnecessary comments**: narrating what the code does, referencing the current task, TODO without a ticket.

## Phase 3: Triage

When agents return, filter findings:

- **Real issues**: bugs, breaking changes, missing tests, regressions of known fixes.
- **Real suggestions**: repeated patterns, scope creep, over-engineering with a simpler alternative.
- **Nitpicks**: style, naming preferences, micro-optimizations.
- **Out of scope**: pre-existing issues this PR didn't touch. Drop or mention once and move on.

Skip false positives silently. Don't pad the review with weak observations. A 2-comment review is better than an 8-comment review where 6 are fluff.

## Phase 4: Draft (Conventional Comments)

Follow the [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) format strictly.

**Format:**

```
<label> [decoration]: <one-line subject>

<optional body, 2-3 sentences default>
```

**A blank line between subject and body is mandatory.** GitHub renders the entire JSON `body` field as markdown; a missing blank line collapses everything into one paragraph and visually merges the subject with the body. When you write the JSON, that means two `\n` characters: `"body": "praise: Right fix.\n\nuseRef(locale) matched the prop..."`. The single-`\n` form `"praise: Right fix. useRef(locale) matched..."` is broken even when it looks correct in your draft preview, because the chat preview folds whitespace.

Subject ends with a period. No em dashes anywhere.

**Right:**
```json
"body": "praise: Right fix.\n\nuseRef(locale) matched the prop immediately on mount, so the effect skipped and dayjs.locale() never ran. useRef(undefined) forces the first run."
```

**Wrong (renders as one paragraph, subject merges into body):**
```json
"body": "praise: Right fix. useRef(locale) matched the prop immediately on mount, so the effect skipped and dayjs.locale() never ran."
```

This is the failure mode you've shipped most recently. The subject and body looked separated in your draft preview but the JSON had a single space, not `\n\n`. Always check the JSON literally.

**Labels** (pick the one that matches):
- `praise`: positive highlights. Only use if it's a specific, non-generic observation worth noting. Skip generic praise.
- `nitpick`: trivial preference. Inherently non-blocking, so the decoration is usually redundant.
- `suggestion`: proposed improvement with a clear reason.
- `issue`: a specific defect that needs attention.
- `todo`: small required change.
- `question`: you're uncertain and need clarification.
- `thought`: a reflection that may or may not need action.
- `chore`: required tasks before merging.
- `note`: informational only.

**Decorations** are optional. Most comments do not need one. The default is no decoration.
- `(blocking)`: should prevent merge until resolved.
- `(non-blocking)`: should not prevent merge.
- `(if-minor)`: resolve only if the fix is trivial.

Decide for yourself whether each comment needs a decoration at all, using this rubric:

- `nitpick`, `praise`, `note`, `question`, `thought`: **no decoration**. The label already conveys severity. Don't add one. Don't ask.
- `suggestion`, `issue`, `todo`, `chore`: usually no decoration either. Add a decoration only when the comment's severity is materially different from what the label alone suggests, and a reader could plausibly misread it. Example: a `suggestion` that you believe must be addressed before merge becomes `(blocking)`. A `suggestion` that is fine to defer needs no decoration. Use `(if-minor)` when the fix is worth doing only if it's cheap.

Only ask the user about the choice of decoration when (a) a decoration is needed and (b) you genuinely cannot tell which one fits. Skip the ask when the user already signaled severity in conversation. If asking for multiple comments, batch them into a single `AskUserQuestion` call with one question per comment.

### Draft each comment without a decoration first

Body length: default to 2-3 sentences. Longer is fine when the context demands it (e.g., explaining why a refactor breaks consumers, or citing a previous fix's log entry). Shorter is fine when the subject is self-explanatory.

### Anchor every comment to a specific line

Inline review comments are the default in this repo, not top-level PR comments. Use the full file path and line number (or line range for multi-line context). The format the user sees:

```
**Inline N** at `<full file path>:<line>` (or `<start>-<end>` for ranges)

<conventional comment body>
```

### Top-level review body

Default to none. The body must add information that no inline comment carries. Two valid use cases:

- **Workflow / structural feedback.** "Thanks for creating the issues, much clearer what this PR fixes. Would have been better one PR per issue but fine for this time." Or "this PR is stacked on #124 and cannot be reviewed in isolation."
- **Required by the API.** GitHub's `REQUEST_CHANGES` and `COMMENT` review events both require a non-empty body. If you have no unique structural content, do not use a review wrapper at all. Post individual inline comments via `/pulls/{N}/comments` (Phase 5, Strategy 1).

Things that are **not** valid top-level bodies, even though they look summary-shaped:
- "All 8 linked issues are closed and the locale-on-mount fix is a real bug fix." (Restates inlines + corporate filler.)
- "Blocking on the public-API change and the missing test." (Restates the inline's `(blocking)` decoration.)
- "Inline comments below." / "See inline." (Achieves nothing.)
- Anything that reads like a press release or movie-trailer voiceover.

If you cannot point at a sentence that says something no inline says, drop the body.

### Decide decorations yourself, ask only when stuck

For each comment, decide whether a decoration is needed using the rubric in the previous section. The default is no decoration. Add `(blocking)`, `(non-blocking)`, or `(if-minor)` only when the comment's true severity is materially different from what the label alone implies.

If after applying the rubric you still cannot tell which decoration fits a comment, ask the user. Batch any asks into a single `AskUserQuestion` call (one question per still-ambiguous comment, up to four). Skip the ask entirely if every comment's decoration is already decided.

### Show the final draft

Present the decorated comments in order. End with: "Say 'post it' to submit as a single review on commit `<sha>`. Or tell me what to tweak."

## Verification Checklist

Before showing the final decorated draft to the user, run through this checklist. Use `TaskCreate` to add one task per item and `TaskUpdate` to mark it completed only after verification. Do not skip items. Do not batch-mark. If an item cannot be checked off honestly, the draft is not ready.

### Scope and intent

- [ ] **Author's other open PRs checked** for stacking. If multiple PRs exist and this one's diff is >30 files, confirmed it is not stacked on top of another branch.
- [ ] **PR title matches the diff's scope.** If the diff does more than the title promises, the out-of-scope work has been called out separately rather than silently reviewed.
- [ ] **Linked issue (if any) read in full.** Constraints from the issue ("no public-API changes", etc.) are reflected in the review.

### Sources of truth

- [ ] **Diff read in full, not skimmed.** For diffs over 35KB, read in chunks with offset/limit.
- [ ] **Each finding verified against the actual file at the actual line.** Open the file, read the line, confirm the issue exists. No findings based purely on sub-agent reports.
- [ ] **External API claims verified.** Any statement about behavior of dayjs, React, Intl, rrule, Tailwind, GitHub API, etc. has a WebFetch backing it, and the source is cited inline in the comment body when relevant.
- [ ] **Dev logs (`docs/logs/`) checked for previously-fixed bugs** that the PR might re-introduce.

### Comment quality

- [ ] **Every comment follows Conventional Comments format**: `<label>: <subject>` on one line, blank line, then optional body. Decorations added in a separate step (see below).
- [ ] **Every comment with a body has a literal `\n\n` between the subject line and the body in the JSON.** Grep the review JSON for `": "` followed by `<label>: ` patterns and confirm the next characters before the body are `\n\n`, not a single space. A missing blank line renders the whole comment as one paragraph on GitHub and the subject visually merges with the body. Verified by opening the posted review URL after submission and confirming the subject sits on its own line.
- [ ] **No em dashes anywhere.** `grep "—"` on the draft returns nothing.
- [ ] **No pleasantries or preamble.** No "well-scoped PR", "nice work", "tests pass" summaries. Top-level body is empty unless there is a structural observation.
- [ ] **Each comment is 2-3 sentences in the body.** Longer is fine when context demands it (citing a prior fix, explaining a breaking-change implication). No padding.
- [ ] **Every comment is anchored to a specific file path and line or line range.** No vague "somewhere in the recurrence module."
- [ ] **No false positives or weak observations.** If a finding is shaky, it is dropped, not softened. A 2-comment review beats an 8-comment review with 6 fluffy ones.
- [ ] **Variables and intermediates that aid readability are not suggested for removal** just because they create a TS narrowing tax or look "redundant."
- [ ] **Readability conventions checked.** Inline multi-clause conditions, multi-level ternaries, nested if/switch blocks, ternaries in JSX, and code that is hard to understand at a glance have been flagged where present.
- [ ] **No movie-narration prose.** No "demonstrably", "worth shipping on its own", "a real X", or any sentence that sounds like a press release. Read the draft aloud as a sanity check.
- [ ] **Each `suggestion` includes a brief reason.** "Drop this `useMemo`" is not enough; "Drop this `useMemo`. Empty deps and no inputs from component scope means it's a module constant in disguise." is.
- [ ] **Pattern sweep done.** For every flagged pattern (useless memo, manual locale helper, hardcoded label, etc.), the diff has been scanned for other instances of the same pattern and either flagged or confirmed absent.
- [ ] **For every new helper introduced by the diff**, asked: "what does this do that the existing library / plugin / standard token does not already do?" Helpers whose answer is "nothing" are flagged for deletion.
- [ ] **Prior review compliance checked.** If a previous review on this PR asked the author to remove or refactor pattern X, and the new revision renamed or relocated it instead of removing it, that is flagged as `(blocking)` with a link to the prior comment.

### Decoration and approval

- [ ] **Decoration decided per comment.** Default is no decoration. Decorations added only where the comment's true severity differs materially from what its label suggests. User asked only for the still-ambiguous subset, batched into one `AskUserQuestion` call. Never silently self-decide `(blocking)`.
- [ ] **Final decorated draft shown to user.**
- [ ] **Explicit "post it" or equivalent approval received.** "Looks good" is not approval.
- [ ] **Commit SHA captured from `headRefOid`** ready to pass as `commit_id` in the API call.
- [ ] **Posting strategy chosen.** No filler top-level body. If there are no blocking comments and no real structural observation, individual inline comments are used instead of a review wrapper. If the only reason to use the review wrapper is "the API needs a body field," the answer is: fall back to individual inline comments instead.

## Phase 5: Post (only after approval)

After explicit user approval, choose the posting strategy based on whether any comment is `(blocking)` and whether you have a real structural observation for a top-level body.

### Decision tree

The key question is **"does my top-level body say something the inlines do not already say?"** That decides the strategy, not the blocking status.

1. **No body content beyond what's in the inlines.** Post each comment as an individual inline review comment via `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{N}/comments`. No review wrapper, no top-level body, no clutter. Works whether or not any comment is `(blocking)`. The GitHub UI loses the "Changes requested" status flag, but each `(blocking)` decoration in the comment body still communicates severity to the author.

2. **Real structural observation + blocking comments.** Single `REQUEST_CHANGES` review via `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{N}/reviews`. Top-level body is the structural observation (workflow feedback, prior-review reference, stacked-branch note). Do not summarize the inlines.

3. **Real structural observation + no blocking comments.** Single `COMMENT` review. Top-level body is the structural observation only.

### Verify the API shape (once per session)

If you haven't fetched the docs this session, WebFetch `https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/reviews` and confirm the request body. The verified shapes:

**Strategy 1 (individual inline comments), per comment:**

```json
{
  "commit_id": "<headRefOid>",
  "path": "<relative file path>",
  "line": <int>,
  "side": "RIGHT",
  "body": "<conventional comment body>"
}
```

For multi-line range, replace `line` with `start_line` + `line` + `start_side` + `side`.

Post each via:
```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments -X POST --input /tmp/pr<N>-cmt-<i>.json
```

**Strategy 2 or 3 (review with comments):**

```json
{
  "commit_id": "<headRefOid>",
  "event": "REQUEST_CHANGES" | "COMMENT",
  "body": "<structural observation, never filler>",
  "comments": [
    { "path": "...", "line": 81, "side": "RIGHT", "body": "..." },
    { "path": "...", "start_line": 45, "start_side": "RIGHT", "line": 50, "side": "RIGHT", "body": "..." }
  ]
}
```

Post via:
```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/reviews -X POST --input /tmp/pr<N>-review.json
```

Return the `html_url` from the response.

### One-off cases

- **Stacked-branch note** that applies the same to multiple PRs: write the body to a single file and `gh pr comment <N> --body-file <file>` per PR. Acceptable as a top-level comment because there is no specific line to anchor to.
- **Single comment on a linked issue**: `gh issue comment <N> --body-file <file>`.

## Project Context

- Repo: `kcsujeet/ilamy-calendar` (default).
- Branch hygiene: feature branches off `main`. PRs to `main`. Stacked branches are a recurring anti-pattern.
- Dev log hook: `.claude/hooks/check-dev-log.sh` blocks session exit when `src/` mtime is newer than today's `docs/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. `git checkout` between branches updates mtimes as a side effect. If the hook fires after a review-only session, `touch docs/logs/<today>.md` (creating it with a brief "review-only" entry if absent) is enough.
- Tests run with `bun test`. CI is `bun run ci`.

## Example: a clean draft

For PR #122 (closes #121, adds now-line to horizontal grids):

```
**Inline 1** at `src/features/calendar/types/index.ts:81`

suggestion: Make `axis` optional rather than required.

Issue #121 explicitly states "No public-API changes." Optional gives the same UX (the library always passes the value), aligns with the issue's intent, and avoids a hard compile break for TS strict-mode consumers who construct the props as a literal. The component already defaults to `'vertical'` at `current-time-indicator.tsx:36`.

**Inline 2** at `src/components/horizontal-grid/horizontal-grid-events-layer.tsx:45-50`

issue: No integration test locks in the `gridType === 'hour'` gate.

Component-level tests verify axis behavior in isolation, but nothing asserts the indicator mounts here when `gridType === 'hour'` and not when `gridType === 'day'`. One render with `data-testid='current-time-indicator'` assertions per gridType would catch a future regression.
```

Apply the rubric: most comments stay un-decorated. For this PR, the public-API change in #1 may be `(blocking)` if the issue's "no public-API changes" constraint is authoritative; the missing test in #2 is `(blocking)` because untested gates regress silently. If those calls feel uncertain, batch them into one `AskUserQuestion`. Otherwise pick directly, show the final, and post.
