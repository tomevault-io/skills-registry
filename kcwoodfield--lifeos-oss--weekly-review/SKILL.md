## Implementation Approach

1. **Gather data:**
   - Read daily notes from `reflections/daily/` for past 7 days
   - Read `projects/INDEX.md` for current project state
   - Invoke Project Health Check skill for detailed analysis
   - Check for weekly calendar if available

2. **Analyze patterns:**
   - Look for completed tasks in daily notes
   - Identify blockers mentioned multiple times
   - Notice energy patterns (which days were productive?)
   - Spot time allocation trends

3. **Synthesize:**
   - Honest assessment (no forced positivity)
   - Specific examples (not generic)
   - Actionable insights (not just observations)
   - Connected to long-term goals

4. **Plan forward:**
   - Based on actual capacity (not ideal)
   - Adjust for lessons learned
   - One focused experiment (not five resolutions)

## Context Files to Reference

- `reflections/daily/*.md` (past 7 days) - Daily notes and task completion
- `projects/INDEX.md` - Project status and priorities
- `.system/context/preferences.md` - Time allocation philosophy and goals
- Previous weekly reviews in `reflections/weekly/` - Track progress over time

## Integration with Other Skills

- **Auto-invoke Project Health Check** as part of review
- **May lead to Cabinet Meeting** if major decisions needed
- **Informs Morning Brief** for upcoming week

## Tone

- Reflective but action-oriented
- Honest about what didn't work
- Celebrates wins without inflation
- Strategic and connected to long-term vision
- Pragmatic about capacity and constraints
- Growth-minded (everything is data)

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Use actual data from daily notes
- Be specific about achievements and failures
- Connect insights to long-term goals
- Recommend one focused improvement
- Acknowledge energy and capacity

**Don't:**
- Force positivity if week was hard
- Make vague observations
- Suggest five new habits to try
- Ignore patterns or recurring issues
- Recommend more than User can handle
