name: change-verification
description: Use for code-change verification: diff review, smoke tests, regression checks, and pre-merge confidence on modified code. Trigger on prompts like 'check my changes', 'review this diff', 'verify this fix', or any request to validate recent edits instead of implementing new code. Use when this capability is needed.

# Change Verification

Verify changed code with high signal, low waste. Start from actual diff, run smallest checks that can prove or disprove safety, then report findings and remaining risk.

## Workflow

1. Inspect worktree first with `git status` and relevant diff.
2. Read changed files and nearby tests before choosing commands.
3. Infer blast radius: docs-only, local behavior, shared abstraction, or public API.
4. Run smallest useful validation first; widen only if risk is broader.
5. Report findings first, then commands run and residual risk.

## Rules

- Never guess what changed. Read diff first.
- Ignore unrelated dirty files unless they affect verification.
- For review requests, prioritize bugs, regressions, and missing tests over summary.
- If nothing fails, say `No findings.` and still note untested risk.
- Do not modify code during pure verification unless user asked for fixes too.

## Validation Ladder

Choose lowest rung that gives real confidence.

- Inspect only: docs, comments, tiny non-executable changes.
- Targeted checks: default for most edits. Prefer touched tests, path-scoped lint, narrow type checks.
- Broad checks: use for shared abstractions, config, public API, or prompt/cache/judge/provider flow.

## IntentGuard Notes

Keep normal work focused on runtime package unless user asks otherwise.

- Main code: `intentguard/`
- Main tests: `tests/`
- Usually out of scope: `validation/`, `ai_research/`

High-risk changes:

- Public API surface: `IntentGuard`, `IntentGuardOptions`
- Runtime flow across prompt factory, cache, inference provider, and judge
- `Judge` uses strict majority, so ties must evaluate false
- Cache keys and cache versioning must stay compatible

Useful commands when scope fits:

```bash
uv run ruff check <changed-paths>
uv run ruff format --check <changed-paths>
uv run mypy intentguard
uv run python -m unittest discover tests
make test
```

## Reporting

Keep response short, concrete, evidence-based.

For review tasks, use:

```markdown
Findings:
1. [severity] `path:line` - issue and impact

Open Questions:
1. ...

Verification:
1. `command` - result

Residual Risk:
1. ...
```

If no issues found:

```markdown
No findings.

Verification:
1. `command` - result

Residual Risk:
1. ...
```
