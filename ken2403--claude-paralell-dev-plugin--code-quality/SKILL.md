# Code Quality Standards

Apply these quality criteria when reviewing or writing code.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand Existing Patterns

Before reviewing or writing code, explore the codebase to understand existing conventions.

- Use Glob to find files with similar patterns (e.g., `Glob("**/*Service.ts")` to find all service files).
- Use Grep to search for usage of specific functions, types, or patterns across the codebase.
- Use Read to examine key files and understand the established coding style, error handling approach, and module structure.

### Step 2: Apply Quality Criteria

Evaluate against: readability, maintainability, simplicity, error handling, type safety.

For detailed criteria, consult `references/checklist.md`.

### Step 3: Check for Code Smells

Flag these common issues:

- Long methods -> break into smaller functions
- Deep nesting -> flatten with early returns
- Magic numbers -> use named constants
- God classes -> split responsibilities
- Dead code -> remove unused code

For naming conventions and style patterns, consult `references/patterns.md`.

### Step 4: Verify Consistency

| Aspect | Check |
|--------|-------|
| Naming | Match existing variable/function naming conventions |
| Structure | Follow established file/directory organization |
| Patterns | Use same design patterns as existing code |
| Formatting | Match indentation, spacing, line breaks |
| Imports | Match import ordering and grouping |
| Error handling | Use same error handling patterns |

### Step 5: Final Review Checklist

- [ ] Logic is correct
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Error handling appropriate
- [ ] Types are correct
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Tests adequate
- [ ] Code is readable
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Consistent with existing codebase style
- [ ] Follows established patterns (verified with Grep/Glob exploration)

### Step 6: Verify Findings Against Codebase

After flagging an issue, use Grep to verify the pattern is consistent across the codebase before reporting. The existing codebase convention takes precedence over general best practices.

## Report Format

For each finding:
- **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Location**: file:line
- **Issue**: Brief description
- **Suggestion**: Specific fix or improvement

## Examples

### Example 1: N+1 Query Detection

When reviewing database access code, watch for queries inside loops:

```python
# Bad - N+1 query
for user in users:
    posts = db.query(Post).filter(Post.user_id == user.id).all()

# Good - Eager loading
users = db.query(User).options(joinedload(User.posts)).all()
```

### Example 2: Early Return for Deep Nesting

```python
# Bad - Deep nesting
def process(data):
    if data:
        if data.is_valid():
            if data.has_permission():
                return do_work(data)

# Good - Early returns
def process(data):
    if not data:
        return None
    if not data.is_valid():
        raise ValueError("Invalid data")
    if not data.has_permission():
        raise PermissionError("Access denied")
    return do_work(data)
```

## Common Issues

### Skill Not Catching Issues

If code quality problems are missed:
1. Verify the codebase was explored first with Grep and Glob
2. Consult the detailed checklist in `references/checklist.md`
3. Check if the issue is language-specific

### Inconsistent Style Feedback

If style suggestions conflict with the existing codebase:
1. Existing codebase patterns always take precedence
2. Use Grep to confirm the established convention
3. Only suggest style changes if the existing pattern is clearly problematic
