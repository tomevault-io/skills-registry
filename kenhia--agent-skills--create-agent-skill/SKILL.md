# Create Agent Skill

## Purpose
Assist in creating new Agent Skills that follow the Agent Skills open standard specification and VS Code conventions.

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- Creating a new Agent Skill for the repository
- Need guidance on Agent Skills structure and format
- Updating or refactoring existing skills

## Agent Skills Structure

### Directory Layout
```
.github/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md
```

**Requirements**:
- Skills must be in `.github/skills/` directory
- Each skill gets its own subdirectory with a descriptive kebab-case name
- Skill content must be in a file named `SKILL.md` (all caps)

### File Format

**YAML Frontmatter** (required):
```yaml
---
name: Human-Readable Skill Name
description: Brief one-line description of what the skill does
---
```

**Markdown Content**:
- Clear heading with skill name
- Purpose/overview section
- When to use this skill
- Step-by-step instructions
- Examples and code blocks
- Success criteria
- Related resources

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Clear and actionable**: Each instruction should be unambiguous
- **Command-focused**: Include actual commands that can be run
- **Context-aware**: Explain when and why to use each step
- **Complete**: Don't assume prior knowledge

### Structure Best Practices
1. **Purpose**: One sentence explaining what the skill does
2. **When to Use**: Specific triggers or scenarios
3. **Prerequisites**: What needs to be in place first (if any)
4. **Steps**: Numbered or sectioned workflow
5. **Expected Results**: What success looks like
6. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
7. **Quick Reference**: Copy-paste friendly commands

### Code Blocks
- Use proper syntax highlighting (```bash, ```python, etc.)
- Include expected output when helpful
- Provide full commands, not fragments
- Add comments for complex operations

## Example Structure

```markdown
---
name: My Skill Name
description: What this skill accomplishes in one line
