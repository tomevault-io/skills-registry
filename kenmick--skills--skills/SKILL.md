# Web Fetcher

Extract web page content as clean text/markdown from a given URL.

## Usage

Run the fetch script:

```bash
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/fetch.py <url>
```

Save to file:

```bash
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/fetch.py <url> -o output.md
```

## Fallback Chain

The script tries these sources in order, falling back on failure:

1. **Jina Reader** (`https://r.jina.ai/{url}`) — best markdown quality
2. **defuddle.md** (`https://defuddle.md/{url}`)
3. **markdown.new** (`https://markdown.new/{url}`)
4. **Raw HTML** — direct fetch as last resort

Progress and errors are printed to stderr. Only the final content goes to stdout.
