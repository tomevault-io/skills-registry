description: Design and review container runtime basics for reproducible local/service execution using Docker. Use when container build/run behavior, networking, volumes, and runtime isolation need explicit decisions; do not use for API contract or requirement prioritization tasks. Use when this capability is needed.

# Docker Basics

## Overview
Use this skill to ensure containerized workloads are reproducible, debuggable, and operationally safe.

## Scope Boundaries
- Use this skill when the task matches the trigger condition described in `description`.
- Do not use this skill when the primary task falls outside this skill's domain.

## Shared References
- Runtime risk catalog:
  - `references/docker-runtime-risk-catalog.md`

## Templates And Assets
- Runtime contract template:
  - `assets/container-runtime-contract-template.md`
- Runtime checklist:
  - `assets/docker-runtime-checklist.md`

## Inputs To Gather
- Application runtime requirements and dependencies.
- Local/dev/prod run differences.
- Required network ports, volumes, and environment variables.
- Security constraints (user, capabilities, filesystem access).

## Deliverables
- Container run policy (entrypoint, env, ports, volumes, user).
- Local reproducibility checklist.
- Runtime risk list (permissions, secrets, mutable state).
- Verification steps for startup and health checks.

## Quick Example
- Run as non-root user.
- Mount only required volume paths.
- Fail fast if required env vars are missing.
- Expose health endpoint and readiness check.

## Quality Standard
- Runtime config is minimal and explicit.
- Container behavior is reproducible across environments.
- Security posture follows least-privilege defaults.
- Health and failure signals are observable.

## Workflow
1. Define container runtime contract using `assets/container-runtime-contract-template.md`.
2. Configure networking, storage, and environment boundaries.
3. Validate startup/health behavior.
4. Verify security constraints and secret handling using `assets/docker-runtime-checklist.md`.
5. Document reproducible run commands.

## Failure Conditions
- Stop when required runtime dependencies are implicit.
- Stop when container requires unnecessary privileged execution.
- Escalate when runtime differences make behavior non-reproducible.
