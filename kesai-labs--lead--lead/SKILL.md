# Project Q&A

Answer the user's question about this project. Use the general lookup order first, then the topic-specific maps below for deeper dives.

## General lookup order

Read these in order:

1. `.claude/docs/project_structure.md` — directory layout and component overview.
2. `README.md` — high-level project description, setup, and usage.
3. `DEVELOPING.md` — development workflow, testing, and contribution guide.
4. `docs/source/` — detailed Sphinx documentation pages.

## Rules

1. **Read in order.** Start with general docs, then dive into topic-specific files.
2. **Be specific.** Point the user to the exact file, section, or line.
3. **Don't guess.** If none of the sources answer the question, say so and suggest where else to look.
