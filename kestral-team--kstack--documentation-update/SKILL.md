# Documentation Update

Update or create documentation to match code changes. This skill maps documentation types in the repo, when each
applies, and how to keep indexes in sync.

---

## Documentation Types

<!-- Customize this table for your project's doc structure -->

| # | Type | Location | Update when |
| - | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Long-form docs | `docs/` subdirectories | New features, architecture, processes |
| 2 | README indexes | Each major directory | Adding/removing doc files |
| 3 | Architecture diagrams | `docs/` (`.d2`, mermaid, etc.) | Adding/removing services, changing data flows |
| 4 | AI coding rules | `.cursor/rules/` | New coding patterns, framework usage changes |
| 5 | AI agent skills | `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Skill workflow changes, new tools/patterns |
| 6 | Agent config | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | Adding/removing rules, skills, commands |
| 7 | Inline JSDoc | Source files | When signature alone doesn't convey intent |

## Writing Style Rules

1. **Link aggressively, never duplicate.** When a concept is documented elsewhere, link to it.
2. **End docs with "See Also" or "References".** Cross-link related docs and source files.
3. **Include a "Code Pointers" table** at the end of feature docs mapping areas to file paths.
4. **Follow this skeleton:** Title → Overview → Body sections → Decision tables → Code Pointers → See Also.
5. **Use tables for structured data** (enums, states, columns, config, decision matrices).
6. **Be concise.** Current state only (not history). Minimal code examples.

## Decision Matrix: What to Update

<!-- Customize these rows for your project -->

| Change type | Required docs | Recommended docs |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| **Infrastructure** (deploy, cloud) | `docs/infrastructure/` + diagrams | Main README index |
| **New feature** | `docs/app/` or `docs/features/` | README index |
| **API / schema changes** | N/A (codegen handles types) | Feature docs if user-facing |
| **Database migration** | N/A unless architecturally significant | Dev process docs for new patterns |
| **New integration** | `docs/integrations/<name>.md` | README index, config docs |
| **Dev workflow changes** | `docs/development_process/` | `CLAUDE.md` commands section |
| **New coding convention** | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | `AGENTS.md` rules index |
| **New AI skill** | `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `AGENTS.md` skills section |

---

## Workflow

1. **Identify affected doc types** — use the decision matrix. Most changes affect 1-2 types.
2. **Create or update the doc** — follow your project's naming convention.
3. **Update indexes** — main README, folder READMEs, `AGENTS.md` as applicable.
4. **Commit docs with code** — documentation is part of the deliverable.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] No content duplicated from another doc — linked instead
- [ ] Cross-doc links use relative paths
- [ ] "See Also" or "References" section at the end
- [ ] Follows skeleton: Title → Overview → Body → Code Pointers → See Also
- [ ] Tables used for structured data
- [ ] Content is concise — current state, not history
- [ ] README index updated if files were added/removed
- [ ] No broken internal links
