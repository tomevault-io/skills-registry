## Key Concepts

### Core NicheCompass Concepts

- **Gene Programs (GPs)**: Biological pathways that NicheCompass uses to make its latent feature space interpretable through linear masked decoders
- **Spatial Multi-omics**: Integration of spatial transcriptomics with other omics modalities like ATAC-seq
- **VGPGAE (Variational Gene Program Graph Autoencoder)**: The core neural architecture that learns spatially consistent cell niches
- **Prior Knowledge GPs**: Gene programs derived from databases like OmniPath, MEBOCOST, CollecTRI, and NicheNet
- **De Novo GPs**: New gene programs discovered by the model beyond prior knowledge
- **Niche Identification (NID)**: Process of identifying spatially consistent cell niches from latent representations
- **Gene Program Recovery (GPR)**: Ability of the model to reconstruct known gene programs
- **Spatial Neighborhood Graph**: KNN graph connecting spatially proximal cells/spots
- **Multimodal Masks**: Gene-peaks mapping for integrating RNA and ATAC-seq data

### Technical Terms

- **Active GP Threshold Ratio**: Parameter determining which gene programs are considered active (default: 0.03)
- **Edge Reconstruction Loss**: Loss component preserving spatial colocalization information
- **Gene Expression Reconstruction Loss**: Loss component ensuring interpretable gene programs
- **Categorical Covariates Contrastive Loss**: Loss for handling batch effects and sample differences
- **GATv2 vs GCNConv**: Different graph neural network layers for the encoder
- **Leiden Clustering**: Community detection algorithm used for niche identification
