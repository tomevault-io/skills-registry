## Quick Reference

### Essential Imports and Setup
```python
import scanpy as sc
import torch
import scarches as sca
from scarches.dataset.trvae.data_handling import remove_sparsity
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import gdown

# Configure scanpy settings
sc.settings.set_figure_params(dpi=200, frameon=False)
sc.set_figure_params(figsize=(4, 4))
torch.set_printoptions(precision=3, sci_mode=False, edgeitems=7)
```

### Data Preparation for scARCHES
```python
# Ensure count data is in adata.X for models using 'nb' or 'zinb' loss
# Remove sparsity for memory efficiency
adata = remove_sparsity(adata)

# Remove obsm and varm matrices to prevent downstream errors
adata.obsm = {}
adata.varm = {}

# Check for integer count data
print(f"Data type: {adata.X.dtype}")
```

### Model Configuration Examples
```python
# TRVAE model with early stopping
condition_key = 'study'
cell_type_key = 'cell_type'
target_conditions = ['Pancreas CelSeq2', 'Pancreas SS2']

trvae_epochs = 500
surgery_epochs = 500

early_stopping_kwargs = {
    "early_stopping_metric": "val_unweighted_loss",
    "threshold": 0,
    "patience": 20,
    "reduce_lr": True,
    "lr_patience": 13,
    "lr_factor": 0.1,
}

# Create TRVAE model with NB loss (default)
trvae_model = sca.models.TRVAE(
    adata=adata,
    condition_key=condition_key,
    recon_loss='nb',  # Use 'mse' for normalized data, 'zinb' for zero-inflated
    beta=1.0,  # MMD regularization strength
    hidden_layers=[128, 128],
    latent_dim=10
)
```

### SCVI Model for Integration
```python
# Create SCVI model with ZINB loss (default)
scvi_model = sca.models.SCVI(
    adata=adata,
    gene_likelihood='zinb'  # Use 'nb' for negative binomial loss
)

# Train the model
scvi_model.train(max_epochs=400)

# Save for later use
scvi_model.save("scvi_model")
```

### Model Surgery for Query Data
```python
# Load pretrained model
scvi_model = sca.models.SCVI.load("scvi_model")

# Perform surgery to adapt to query data
query_model = sca.models.SCVI.load_query_data(
    scvi_model,
    adata_query,
    freeze_classifier=True  # Keep reference embeddings stable
)

# Train on query data with fewer epochs
query_model.train(max_epochs=200)

# Get latent representations
latent = query_model.get_latent_representation()
adata_query.obsm["X_scVI"] = latent
```

### Setting Up Model Variables for Reference Mapping
```python
# For HLCA (Human Lung Cell Atlas) mapping
batch_key = 'batch'           # How batches are identified
labels_key = 'cell_type'      # Cell type annotations
unlabeled_category = 'unlabeled'  # Category for unknown cells

# Set query batch (usually single batch per dataset)
adata_query.obs[batch_key] = 'my_dataset'

# Set all query cells as unlabeled for mapping
adata_query.obs[labels_key] = unlabeled_category
```

### KNN Classification for Label Transfer
```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

# Train KNN on latent representations
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=15)
knn.fit(reference_latent, reference_labels)

# Predict labels for query data
predicted_labels = knn.predict(query_latent)
adata_query.obs['predicted_cell_type'] = predicted_labels

# Calculate prediction confidence
confidence_scores = knn.predict_proba(query_latent)
adata_query.obs['prediction_confidence'] = np.max(confidence_scores, axis=1)
```

### Training Tips and Hyperparameters
```python
# Model architecture recommendations
hidden_layers = [128, 128]  # Default, good for most datasets
latent_dim = 10             # Default (10-20 recommended)
beta = 1.0                  # MMD strength for TRVAE

# Loss function selection
if has_raw_counts:
    recon_loss = 'nb' or 'zinb'  # For count data
else:
    recon_loss = 'mse'           # For normalized data

# Early stopping for TRVAE
early_stopping_kwargs = {
    "early_stopping_metric": "val_unweighted_loss",  # Best for TRVAE
    "threshold": 0,
    "patience": 20,
    "reduce_lr": True,
    "lr_patience": 13,
    "lr_factor": 0.1,
}
```

## Key Concepts

### Model Types
- **SCVI**: Single-cell Variational Inference for count data integration
- **SCANVI**: Semi-supervised extension with cell type labels
- **TRVAE**: Transfer VAE with MMD regularization for cross-dataset integration
- **totalVI**: Multi-modal model for RNA + protein data
- **mvTCR**: Multi-modal model for transcriptome + TCR data

### Model Surgery
A technique to adapt pre-trained reference models to new query data by:
1. Loading the reference model
2. Adding new query-specific parameters
3. Freezing reference embeddings
4. Training only query adaptation layers

### Loss Functions
- **nb (Negative Binomial)**: Good for count data with overdispersion
- **zinb (Zero-Inflated NB)**: Handles excess zeros in scATAC-seq
- **mse (Mean Squared Error)**: Use for normalized/log-transformed data

### Key Hyperparameters
- **beta**: MMD regularization strength (higher = more integration, lower = preserve biology)
- **alpha_kl**: KL divergence weight for SCVI/SCANVI
- **latent_dim**: Dimensionality of the latent space (10-20 recommended)
- **early_stopping_metric**: 'val_unweighted_loss' for TRVAE, 'elbo_validation' for SCVI

## Notes

### Data Requirements
- **Raw counts** are required for 'nb' and 'zinb' loss functions
- **Highly variable genes** (2000-5000) recommended for model training
- **Batch information** should be stored in adata.obs columns
- **Cell type labels** needed for SCANVI training in semisupervised mode

### Performance Considerations
- Use **remove_sparsity()** for better memory efficiency
- Implement **early stopping** to prevent overfitting
- Monitor **training loss curves** for convergence issues
- Adjust **beta parameter** based on integration quality vs. biological variation

### Common Pitfalls
- Using normalized data with count-based loss functions (nb, zinb)
- Forgetting to set query cells to 'unlabeled' category for mapping
- Not checking that gene symbols/match between reference and query
- Overfitting when using too many latent dimensions (>50)
