# Git Commit

Create properly formatted git commit messages following conventional commit standards.

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format: `{type}({scope}): {description}`

The scope is optional but encouraged when the change is scoped to a specific component, module, or package.

### Valid Types

- **feat** - New feature or functionality
- **fix** - Bug fix
- **chore** - Maintenance tasks (dependencies, config, etc.)
- **docs** - Documentation changes
- **style** - Code style/formatting (no logic changes)
- **refactor** - Code restructuring (no behavior changes)
- **test** - Adding or updating tests
- **perf** - Performance improvements
- **ci** - CI/CD pipeline changes
- **build** - Build system or external dependencies

### Breaking Changes

Append `!` after the type/scope to signal a breaking change:

```
feat!: remove deprecated API endpoints
feat(auth)!: change token format from JWT to opaque
```

Or include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the commit body:

```
feat(api)!: rename user endpoint

BREAKING CHANGE: /api/user is now /api/users — update all clients
```

### Examples

```
feat: add new authentication endpoint
feat(auth): implement JWT-based login flow
fix: resolve null pointer exception in API handler
fix(payments): handle declined card response correctly
chore: update dependencies
chore(deps): upgrade Spring Boot to 3.2.0
docs: update README with deployment instructions
refactor(validation): extract logic into separate service
test(user-service): add unit tests for registration flow
perf(db): optimize user query with index
ci: add automated deployment workflow
```

### Multi-line Commits

When a single-line description isn't enough, add a blank line then a body:

```
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 PKCE flow

Replaces the implicit grant flow with PKCE for better security.
Refresh tokens are now rotated on each use.

## Best Practices

- Keep the subject line concise (72 chars or fewer)
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Start description with lowercase after the colon
- No period at the end of the subject line
- Put the "why" and context in the body, not the subject
- Always include `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>` trailer when Copilot assisted
