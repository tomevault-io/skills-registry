description: Context for Kevin's Obsidian vault structure, organization, and search strategies. Use whenever working with Obsidian notes — searching for past meetings, finding what was decided about a topic, looking up a colleague, navigating daily notes, creating new meeting notes or people profiles, or any question about the HPE vault. Invoke this skill before searching the vault so you use the correct paths, naming conventions, and search strategies rather than guessing. Use when this capability is needed.

# Obsidian Vault Context Skill

## Purpose
This skill provides comprehensive context about Kevin's Obsidian vault structure, file organization, naming conventions, and search strategies. It helps GitHub Copilot quickly locate and work with Obsidian notes without searching through random directories.

## When to Use This Skill
Invoke this skill when the user asks questions about:
- **People and meetings**: "When was the last time I met with [person]?", "What did we discuss with [person]?"
- **Topics and decisions**: "What did we decide about [topic]?", "When did we talk about [subject]?"
- **Creating new content**: "Create a meeting note", "Add a person profile"
- **Vault navigation**: Finding specific types of notes or understanding file locations
- **Obsidian configuration**: Plugin settings, templates, daily notes setup

- `#note` - Applied to general notes
- `#HPE` - Used in Todoist filters for work tasks

## Dataview Queries

### Meeting List in Daily Notes
```dataview
LIST
WHERE when=date(this.file.name) AND contains(tags, "meeting")
```

### Note List in Daily Notes
```dataview
LIST
WHERE when=date(this.file.name) AND contains(tags, "note")
```

## Search Strategies

### Finding Meetings with a Person
1. **Check People profile**: `/People/[Last], [First].md` may have backlinks
2. **Search Meetings directory**: 
   ```bash
   grep -r "[Person Name]" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Meetings/ --include="*.md"
   ```
3. **Look for wiki links**: Search for `[[Last, First]]` or `[[First Last]]`

### Finding Discussions About a Topic
1. **Check SIC directory**: Topic-specific notes in `/SIC/`
2. **Search Meetings**: 
   ```bash
   grep -ri "[topic]" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Meetings/ --include="*.md"
   ```
3. **Search Daily Notes**: May contain brief mentions
4. **ALWAYS Check Notes directory**: Standalone documentation, schedules, and reference material
   ```bash
   grep -ri "[topic]" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Notes/ --include="*.md"
   ```

**IMPORTANT**: When searching for information in the Obsidian vault, ALWAYS include the `/Notes/` directory in your search. This directory contains critical standalone documentation, schedules (like PTP/P2P release schedules), and reference material that may not be found in Meetings or Daily Notes.

### Finding Decisions
1. **Search for "decide"/"decided"** in Meetings:
   ```bash
   grep -ri "decide" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Meetings/ --include="*.md" | grep -i "[topic]"
   ```
2. **Check "Take Aways" sections**: Meeting notes have Take Aways section
3. **Check "Actions" sections**: Action items from meetings
4. **Search Notes directory**: May contain decision documentation:
   ```bash
   grep -ri "decide" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Notes/ --include="*.md"
   ```

## Quick Reference Commands

### Search by Person
```bash
# Find all meetings with a person
grep -ri "kashish" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Meetings/ --include="*.md"

# Find person's profile
ls /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/People/ | grep -i kashish
```

### Search by Topic
```bash
# Find topic in meetings
grep -ri "juniper" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Meetings/ --include="*.md"

# Find topic in SIC notes
grep -ri "horizontal.*scaler" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/SIC/ --include="*.md"

# ALWAYS search Notes directory too
grep -ri "[topic]" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Notes/ --include="*.md"
```

### Search by Date Range
```bash
# Find meetings in January 2024
ls /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Meetings/ | grep "^2024-01-"

# Find daily notes in a date range
ls /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Daily\ Notes/ | grep "^2024-01-"
```

### Find Recent Meetings
```bash
# List meetings sorted by date (most recent last)
ls -t /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Meetings/ | head -20
```

## Common Workflows

### Answer "When was the last meeting with [Person]?"
1. Search Meetings directory for person's name
2. Look at filenames to get dates (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
3. Sort by date to find most recent
4. Can also check person's profile for backlinks

### Answer "What did we discuss/decide about [Topic]?"
1. Search Meetings directory for topic keyword
2. Search SIC directory if topic is SIC-related
3. **ALWAYS search Notes directory** for standalone documentation and reference material
4. Look in relevant sections: Subject, Notes, Take Aways, Actions
5. Check Daily Notes for brief mentions

### Create New Meeting Note
1. Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD - [Meeting Name].md`
2. Place in `/Meetings/` directory
3. Apply Meeting Notes template
4. Add frontmatter with date and meeting tag
5. Link to attendees' People profiles

### Create New Person Profile
1. Use format: `[Last], [First].md`
2. Place in `/People/` directory
3. Add frontmatter with aliases

5. Link to relevant projects

## Team Context

### Teams Mentioned
- **Green Team**: Has daily standups, planning meetings
- **Magenta Team**: Has daily standups
- **SIC Team**: Sustainability Insight Center project team

### Common Meeting Types
- Daily standups (Green, Magenta)
- Weekly syncs (Aruba, Istanbul)
- Planning meetings

- 1-1 meetings

## Best Practices

1. **Always check exact directories first** - Don't search randomly
2. **Use grep with specific paths** - More efficient than broad searches
3. **ALWAYS include the Notes directory in searches** - Contains schedules, documentation, and reference material not found elsewhere
4. **Look for wiki link patterns** - `[[Name]]` for finding references
5. **Check Meetings, Daily Notes, AND Notes directories** - Information may be in any of these
6. **Use date-based sorting** - Files are date-prefixed for easy sorting
7. **Check People profiles for context** - May have role/project information
8. **Search multiple forms of names** - "Kashish", "Pahwa", "Pahwa, Kashish"

## Example Queries and Responses

### Query: "When was the last time I was in a meeting with Kashish?"
**Strategy**:
1. Search: `grep -ri "kashish" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Meetings/ --include="*.md"`
2. Extract dates from filenames
3. Sort and return most recent

### Query: "When was the last time we talked about integrating with Juniper?"
**Strategy**:
1. Search: `grep -ri "juniper" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Meetings/ --include="*.md"`
2. Also search: `/SIC/` directory if SIC-related
3. Extract dates and contexts

### Query: "What did we decide to do about the horizontal auto scaler for SIC?"
**Strategy**:
1. Search SIC directory: `grep -ri "horizontal.*scaler" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/SIC/ --include="*.md"`
2. Search Meetings: `grep -ri "horizontal.*scaler" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Meetings/ --include="*.md"`
3. Search Notes directory: `grep -ri "horizontal.*scaler" /Users/kevin/Documents/Obsidian/HPE/Notes/ --include="*.md"`
4. Look for "decide" or "decision" near mentions
5. Check Take Aways and Actions sections
