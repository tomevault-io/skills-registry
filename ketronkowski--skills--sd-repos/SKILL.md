# SD/SIC Repository Finder

## Overview

Quickly locate and identify SD/SIC repositories both locally and remotely. Understand the equivalence between SD (Sustainability Dashboard) and SIC (Sustainability Insight Center) terminology, and distinguish ADS applications from other infrastructure repositories.

## Key Terminology

**SD = Sustainability Dashboard = SIC = Sustainability Insight Center**

These terms are completely interchangeable and refer to the same product.

**ADS = Application Deployment Service**

ADS refers to applications tagged with the `ads-app` GitHub topic. NOT "Anomaly Detection Service" or "Application Delivery Service".

## Quick Repository Locations

- **Local:** `/Users/kevin/git/glcp/sd/`
- **Remote:** GitHub organization `glcp` (https://github.com/glcp/)

## Finding Repositories

### Check if a Repository is an ADS App

```bash
# Single repository check
gh api "repos/glcp/{repo_name}/topics" --jq '.names[]' | grep -q "ads-app"

# Using bundled script
bash scripts/check_ads_app.sh sd-data-service
```

### List All Remote SD Repositories

```bash
# Most efficient method - all SD repos
gh search repos --owner glcp --topic sustainability-dashboard --limit 100 --json name,description,language

# Only ADS-tagged repos
gh search repos --owner glcp --topic ads-app sd- --limit 100 --json name,description,language
```

### List All Local ADS Apps

```bash
# Manual check in SD directory
cd /Users/kevin/git/glcp/sd
for repo in sd-*/; do 
  repo_name=$(basename "$repo")
  topics=$(gh api "repos/glcp/$repo_name/topics" --jq '.names[]' 2>/dev/null)
  if echo "$topics" | grep -q "ads-app"; then 
    echo "$repo_name"
  fi
done

# Using bundled script
bash scripts/list_all_ads_apps.sh
```

## Repository Categories

**14 ADS Applications** - Tagged with both `sustainability-dashboard` AND `ads-app`:
- Backend Services (Kotlin): 11 microservices
- Frontend (TypeScript): sd-frontend
- ML/Data Science (Python): sd-ad-*, sd-ml-forecasting

**Non-ADS Repositories** - Tagged with `sustainability-dashboard` only:
- Infrastructure: sd-deploy-repo, sd-ops, sd-terraform-alerts
- Frontend: sd-ops-frontend

For the complete repository list with descriptions, see [repository-catalog.md](references/repository-catalog.md).

## Management Scripts

Located in the local SD directory `/Users/kevin/git/glcp/sd/` (not in this skill):
- `create_*_prs.sh` - PR creation automation
- `update_*.sh` - Repository update scripts
- `check_*.sh` - Verification scripts
- `merge_all_prs.sh` - PR merge automation

## Deployment & Kubernetes

For comprehensive cluster access and deployment information:
```bash
cat /Users/kevin/git/glcp/sd/sd-ops/copilot/comprehensive-cluster-guide.md
```

## Bundled Resources

### scripts/
- `check_ads_app.sh` - Check if a repository has the ads-app topic
- `list_all_ads_apps.sh` - List all ADS apps in local SD directory

### references/
- `repository-catalog.md` - Complete repository list with descriptions, categories, and locations
