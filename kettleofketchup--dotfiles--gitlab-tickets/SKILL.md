# GitLab Tickets

Create well-structured GitLab issues through natural conversation using `glab` CLI.

## Prerequisites

- `glab` CLI installed and authenticated
- Run `glab auth status` to verify

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Idea

Ask clarifying questions **one at a time** to understand:
- What type of work (feature, bug, chore, docs)
- The core problem or need
- Key requirements and constraints
- Acceptance criteria

Prefer multiple-choice questions when possible.

### 2. Summarize Before Creating

Present a brief summary of the ticket before creating:
```
**[Title]**
- Bullet points of key details
- Scope and acceptance criteria
```

Ask: "Does this capture what you want, or should I change something?"

### 3. Create the Issue

Use `glab issue create` with structured description:

```bash
glab issue create \
  --title "Descriptive title" \
  --label "feature" \
  --description "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
Brief description of the work.

## Details
- Key requirements
- Technical approach (if known)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criteria 1
- [ ] Criteria 2
EOF
)"
```

### 4. Link Related Issues

When issues are related, add links in the description:
- `Related to #N` - general relationship
- `Blocks #N` - this must be done first
- `Depends on #N` - this needs another issue done first

## Label Management

Check existing labels: `glab label list`

Create labels if needed:
```bash
glab label create -n "label-name" -c "#hex-color" -d "Description"
```

Standard labels:
| Label | Color | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| feature | #28a745 | New functionality |
| bug | #dc3545 | Something broken |
| chore | #6c757d | Maintenance, CI/CD |
| docs | #0366d6 | Documentation |

## Breaking Down Work

If an issue is large, offer to break it into smaller tickets:
- Create an epic/parent issue for the overall feature
- Create child issues for individual tasks
- Link children to parent with "Part of #N"

## Resuming a Session

To get context when resuming a ticketing session, run `scripts/context.sh` to see:
- Current repository
- Existing labels
- Recent issues

## Commands Reference

```bash
glab issue list                    # List open issues
glab issue view <id>               # View issue details
glab issue create                  # Interactive create
glab issue update <id> --label X   # Add label
glab label list                    # List labels
```
