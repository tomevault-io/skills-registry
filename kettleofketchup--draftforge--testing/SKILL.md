description: DraftForge test infrastructure for writing backend unit tests, Playwright E2E tests, and managing test data population. This skill should be used when writing new tests, adding test fixtures, creating populate functions for new features, adding Playwright E2E specs, using login/auth fixtures, creating test users/orgs/leagues/tournaments, or understanding the test data architecture. Covers backend Django tests via Docker, Playwright config (projects, workers, sharding), test auth endpoints that expose backend login to frontend, and feature-isolated test data patterns. Use when this capability is needed.

# DraftForge Testing Infrastructure

## Self-Updating

This skill documents live code. When modifying test infrastructure, update the relevant reference file.
To verify current state, read the source files referenced in each section.

## Critical Rules

1. **Always use `data-testid` selectors** in Playwright tests and demos. Never use `getByLabel`, `getByText`, or `getByRole('combobox')` for element interaction. See [playwright-fixtures.md](references/playwright-fixtures.md) for the full policy and exceptions.
2. **Use `postWithCsrf`/`patchWithCsrf`** for all POST/PATCH calls to DRF ViewSet endpoints (not test endpoints). See [playwright-fixtures.md](references/playwright-fixtures.md) for CSRF handling.

## Architecture Overview

Two-layer test data system:
1. **Data definitions** (`backend/tests/data/`) - Pydantic models (TestUser, TestOrganization, TestLeague, TestTeam, TestTournament)
2. **Populate functions** (`backend/tests/populate/`) - Create DB records from data definitions

Backend exposes `/api/tests/*` endpoints (TEST=true only) so Playwright can login, reset state, and create test-specific data.

## Key Principle: Feature-Isolated Test Data

Each feature's E2E tests MUST use dedicated test data. Never reuse another feature's org/league/tournament.

See [references/feature-isolation.md](references/feature-isolation.md) for the full pattern.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Backend (Docker - use --entrypoint "" to bypass daphne)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yaml run --rm --entrypoint "" backend \
  python manage.py test app.tests.test_csv_import -v 2

# Playwright
just test::pw::headless              # All tests
just test::pw::spec csv-import       # Specific suite
just test::pw::ui                    # Interactive UI mode

# Full setup (down, update, build, populate, up)
just test::setup

# Repopulate test data only
just db::populate::all
```

## Cacheops and Test State Resets

Django cacheops is active in the test environment (1-hour TTL for Organization, League, etc.). **M2M changes (`.add()`, `.remove()`, `.clear()`) do NOT auto-invalidate cacheops cache.**

When writing test reset endpoints or backend views that modify M2M fields:

```python
from cacheops import invalidate_obj

org.admins.clear()
org.admins.add(admin_user)
invalidate_obj(org)  # REQUIRED after M2M changes
```

Without `invalidate_obj()`, subsequent GET requests return stale cached data — a common cause of flaky E2E tests where state resets appear to not take effect.

See [references/backend-test-endpoints.md](references/backend-test-endpoints.md) for the full pattern.
