# Angular Expert

Expert guidance for enterprise Angular v21+ development. Enforces architectural heuristics that prevent maintenance nightmares at scale.

## Core Architectural Imperatives

These rules apply to ALL Angular code. Violations create technical debt.

### 1. Standalone Components Only
All components, directives, and pipes MUST be standalone. `SharedModule` pattern is prohibited.
```typescript
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, RouterLink], // Explicit imports
})
```

### 2. Dependency Ladder (Strict)
Dependencies flow downward ONLY: `Feature → UI → Data-Access → Utility`
- **Feature**: Smart components, routing, orchestration
- **UI**: Dumb/presentational components (NO service injection)
- **Data-Access**: Stores, facades, HTTP services, entities
- **Utility**: Pure functions, validators, types

### 3. Component-Service Firewall
Smart components NEVER inject `HttpClient`, `Router`, or raw stores directly. Inject domain-specific Facades.
```typescript
// ❌ VIOLATION
constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

// ✅ COMPLIANT
constructor(private userFacade: UserFacade) {}
```

### 4. Humble Components
Extract ALL complex logic to services/facades. Components should be thin glue with minimal branching.

### 5. Signals for State, RxJS for Events
- **Signals**: Hold data, derive values, render to view (synchronous)
- **RxJS**: Streams of actions, HTTP requests, complex timing coordination
- Use `toSignal()` to convert final Observable stage for templates

### 6. Push State Down
```
Global State  → User session, theme, language (Root store/service)
Feature State → Filters, pagination, form data (SignalStore in route)
Component State → UI toggles, ephemeral input (signal() on component)
```

### 7. Zoneless-Ready Code
Never mutate state expecting Angular to "magically" detect it. Always use Signals or AsyncPipe. No relying on Zone.js patches for `setTimeout`/`setInterval`.

## Testing Philosophy: Sociable Tests

Reject the Mockist approach. Test behavior, not implementation.

### The No-Mock Policy
- ✅ Provide REAL services in TestBed
- ✅ Mock ONLY at system boundaries: Network (MSW), Time, Browser APIs
- ❌ Never use `jasmine.createSpyObj` or `vi.fn()` for services
- ❌ Never spy on internal methods

### Verification Pattern
```typescript
// ❌ MOCKIST (Banned)
expect(spy.getUsers).toHaveBeenCalled();

// ✅ SOCIABLE (Required)
expect(screen.getByText('John')).toBeVisible();
```

### Zoneless Testing
```typescript
it('should work', async () => {
  await component.doSomething();
  await fixture.whenStable(); // Wait for framework tasks
  fixture.detectChanges();    // Explicit view update
  expect(...).toBe(...);
});
```

Use `TestBed.tick()` after setting signals that drive effects.

## Reference Guides

Load these when working on specific concerns:

- **[Architecture & Boundaries](references/architecture.md)**: Module boundaries, Nx constraints, Hexagonal architecture, circular dependency prevention. Load when designing new features or restructuring.

- **[Testing Strategy](references/testing.md)**: Vitest configuration, MSW setup, Harness patterns, VRT. Load when writing tests or setting up test infrastructure.

- **[Signal Patterns](references/signal-patterns.md)**: SignalStore, Signal Forms, computed patterns, effect synchronization. Load when implementing state management or forms.

- **[Code Templates](references/code-templates.md)**: Ready-to-use templates for components, stores, tests, harnesses. Load when scaffolding new files.

**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.
