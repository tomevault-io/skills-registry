description: Orchestrate sprint implementation by managing branches, PRs, and CI while delegating coding to the sprint-implement agent. Use when implementing PRs from a sprint plan. Triggers on commands like "/sprint-orchestration sprint 1" or requests to "implement the sprint" or "work on sprint PRs". Also triggers on "perform the final review for sprint N" or "do the sprint final review" for cross-cutting code review after all PRs are drafted. This skill manages the process but does NOT write code - it delegates to sprint-implement for implementation and code-simplifier for reviews. Use when this capability is needed.

# Sprint Orchestration

Coordinate the implementation of PRs defined in a sprint plan. Delegate all code writing to `sprint-implement` while handling branch management, Pull Request lifecycle, and CI monitoring.

**You do NOT write code. You manage the process.**

## CRITICAL SAFETY RULE

### NEVER MERGE A PR WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL

This is the **MOST IMPORTANT RULE**. Violation is a **CRITICAL FAILURE**.

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:**
- NEVER merge any PR without explicit user approval
- NEVER assume approval is implied
- NEVER interpret silence as consent to merge
- NEVER auto-merge after CI passes

**MANDATORY APPROVAL FLOW:**
1. Complete all PRs and present them for review
2. **STOP COMPLETELY** and wait for user response
3. User MUST explicitly say: "approved", "lgtm", "merge it", "go ahead", or similar
4. **ONLY AFTER** receiving explicit approval, proceed with merging

**IF IN DOUBT, DO NOT MERGE. ASK FOR CLARIFICATION.**

---

## Version Control Requirement

**Load the `jujutsu` skill before any VCS operation.** This project uses Jujutsu (jj) exclusively.

See `.claude/skills/jujutsu/` for all VCS workflows including:
- Working copy management
- Stack management (bookmarks)
- Pushing to remote
- Conflict resolution
- **Quality gates** (`jj fix`, `jj quality`, `jj secure-push`)

---

## Reference Documents

Load these references when needed:

- **[Merge Process](references/merge-process.md)** - **MUST READ before merging any PR.** Contains critical steps to prevent GitHub from auto-closing child PRs. Do NOT merge from memory.
- **[Sprint Final Review](references/sprint-final-review.md)** - Cross-cutting review of all sprint PRs after first drafts are complete. Load when user asks to "perform the final review" for a sprint.

---

## Input

- **Sprint Number** (required): Which sprint to work on (e.g., "sprint 1", "S1")
- **PR Scope** (optional): Which PRs to process (e.g., "S1PR1", "all", "next 2")
  - Default: Process all remaining PRs in the sprint

---

## Pre-Flight Checks

### 1. Locate Sprint Plan

```bash
ls mddocs/frontend/sprints/sprint*.md
```

If not found: STOP with "Sprint plan not found. Run `/frontend-sprint-plan` first."

### 2. Verify Tools

```bash
jj version
gh auth status
```

- If jj not installed: STOP with error
- If GitHub CLI not authenticated: provide setup instructions

### 3. Parse Sprint Plan

Extract from sprint plan:
- Sprint goal and scope
- List of PRs with details
- Which PRs are already complete (check "Definition of Done" section)

---

## Main Orchestration Loop

For each PR in scope (in dependency order):

### Phase 1: PR Analysis

1. **Extract PR details**: ID, goal, files, background reading, acceptance criteria, dependencies, estimated lines
2. **Determine bookmark name**: `sprint-<N>/<pr-id>/<brief-description>`
3. **Check dependencies**: Verify dependent PRs exist or are merged; skip if not met
4. **Log scope** (no pause): Display PR ID, goal, estimated LOC

### Phase 2: Branch Setup

**Load the `jujutsu` skill** and follow its workflows for:

1. **Check working copy state**: Use jujutsu skill's state verification protocol
2. **Create bookmark for PR**: Use jujutsu skill's bookmark management workflow
3. **Verify setup**: Check `jj status` and `jj log`

Bookmark naming convention: `sprint-<N>/<pr-id>/<description>`

### Phase 3: Delegate to Implementation Agent

1. **Prepare context**:
   - PR goal and acceptance criteria
   - Files to create/modify
   - **Background reading links** (critical)
   - Any error logs from previous CI failures

2. **Invoke `sprint-implement` agent** using the Task tool:
   ```
   Task tool with subagent_type="sprint-implement"
   ```
   Pass full PR details including background reading. **WAIT** for completion.

3. **Verify implementation**: Check `jj status`, verify changes align with PR goal

### Phase 3b: Code Simplification

After the implementation agent completes, invoke the code-simplifier to review and potentially simplify the changes.

1. **Determine diff scope** using jj:
   ```bash
   jj diff --stat
   ```

2. **Invoke `code-simplifier` agent** using the Task tool:
   ```
   Task tool with subagent_type="code-simplifier:code-simplifier"
   ```

   **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS TO PASS TO CODE-SIMPLIFIER:**

   ```markdown
   ## Scope Constraint (MANDATORY)

   You MUST only review and modify code that is part of THIS PR's changes.

   **Determine the diff scope:**
   - Run: `jj diff --stat` to see files in scope
   - Run: `jj diff` to see the actual changes

   **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:**
   - DO NOT modify any code outside the files listed in the diff
   - DO NOT modify any lines within those files that weren't changed by this PR
   - DO NOT "improve" code in other areas of the codebase, even if you see obvious improvements
   - DO NOT touch code from parent PRs in the stack

   **Your scope is ONLY:**
   - Code added or modified in this PR (current working copy changes)
   - Simplifications that maintain the same functionality
   - Clarity improvements within the PR's changed code

   ## What to Look For

   Within the PR scope, look for opportunities to:
   - Reduce code complexity without changing behavior
   - Improve readability and clarity
   - Remove unnecessary abstractions or indirection
   - Consolidate duplicate logic introduced in this PR
   - Simplify conditional logic
   - Use more idiomatic patterns for the language/framework

   ## Output

   If no meaningful simplifications are found, report that the code is already clean.
   If simplifications are made, briefly list what was changed and why.
   ```

3. **Verify simplifications** (if any were made):
   - Run `jj diff` to review the simplifier's changes
   - Ensure changes are within the PR scope

### Phase 4: Commit and Push

**Load the `jujutsu` skill** and follow its workflows:

1. **Format code**: `jj fix` (auto-applies ruff, prettier, buf format)

2. **Review changes**: `jj diff --stat` (target ~200 lines max)

3. **Describe the commit** (using jujutsu skill's describe-then-new pattern):
   ```bash
   jj describe -m "<PR-ID>: <brief description>

   <PR goal>

   Acceptance Criteria:
   - <criteria 1>
   - <criteria 2>
   "
   ```

4. **Create bookmark and push** (using jujutsu skill's GitHub sync workflow):
   ```bash
   jj bookmark create <bookmark-name> -r @
   jj git push --bookmark <bookmark-name>
   ```

### Phase 5: Create PR and Monitor CI

1. **Create Draft PR**:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --draft --title "<PR-ID>: <description>" --body "## Goal
   <PR goal>

   ## Sprint Context
   Sprint: <N>
   Sprint Plan: mddocs/frontend/sprints/sprint<N>.md

   ## Acceptance Criteria
   - [ ] <criteria>

   ## Background Reading
   - <links>
   "
   ```

2. **Monitor CI** (poll, NEVER use `gh run watch`):
   ```bash
   gh run list --branch <bookmark-name> --limit 1 --json databaseId,status
   gh run view <run-id> --json status,conclusion
   ```

3. **Handle CI Failure**:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
   ```
   Re-invoke `sprint-implement` with error context. Max 3 attempts.

4. **CI Success**: `gh pr ready`

### Phase 6: Record Progress

Log PR completion (number, URL, branch). Add to batch for review. Continue to next PR.

### Phase 7: Batch Review Gate (APPROVAL REQUIRED)

After ALL requested PRs are complete:

1. **Present summary**:
   ```markdown
   ## Sprint <N> Progress

   | PR | Branch | Status | LOC |
   |----|--------|--------|-----|
   | S1PR1 | sprint-1/pr1/scaffold | Ready | 45 |

   All PRs ready for review.

   AWAITING YOUR APPROVAL - I will NOT merge until you explicitly approve.
   ```

2. **Request explicit approval**:
   - "Reply **'approved'** to merge all PRs"
   - "Reply **'approved S1PR1'** to merge specific PRs"
   - "Reply **'changes S1PR2: <feedback>'** for revisions"

3. **MANDATORY FULL STOP**:
   - DO NOT PROCEED
   - DO NOT MERGE ANYTHING
   - WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE

### Phase 8: Merge PRs (ONLY AFTER APPROVAL)

> **MANDATORY: READ [references/merge-process.md](references/merge-process.md) BEFORE MERGING ANY PR**
>
> The merge process contains critical steps that MUST be followed exactly. Skipping steps will cause GitHub to auto-close child PRs or create orphaned branches. **DO NOT attempt to merge from memory. READ THE REFERENCE FIRST.**

**PRE-MERGE VERIFICATION**: Did user EXPLICITLY approve? If NO or UNSURE: STOP.

**BEFORE YOUR FIRST MERGE**: Read [references/merge-process.md](references/merge-process.md) in its entirety. This is not optional.

Follow the merge process reference for each approved PR (oldest/parent first):
1. Find and update all child PR bases BEFORE merging
2. Squash merge with `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`
3. Fetch and sync local state using jujutsu skill's workflows
4. Handle any conflicts using jujutsu skill's conflict resolution
5. Log completion

---
