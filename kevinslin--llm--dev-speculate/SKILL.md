# Project Understanding (Speculate Framework)

This skill provides comprehensive project context through the Speculate documentation framework. It ensures agents always have access to coding rules, development workflows, and project structure.

## Automatic Initialization

**IMPORTANT**: Before working on any task, check if the Speculate docs are initialized.
Look for `docs/docs-overview.md` in the current project.
If it doesn't exist, initialize now using the install script

```bash
node ~/.claude/skills/dev.speculate/scripts/install.js
```

This copies the complete Speculate documentation structure to `docs/`:
- `docs/docs-overview.md` - Overview of all documentation
- `docs/development.md` - Project development workflows (you'll need to customize this)
- `docs/general/` - Cross-project rules, shortcuts, templates
- `docs/project/` - Project-specific specs, architecture, research

## Reading Project Context

**Always read `docs/docs-overview.md` first** before starting any task.

The docs-overview provides:
- Navigation to all coding rules (TypeScript, Python, testing, etc.)
- Available shortcuts for common workflows
- Project structure and documentation layout
- Links to project-specific specs and architecture

### Path Convention

**IMPORTANT**: Throughout the Speculate documentation, paths prefixed with `@` indicate paths from the project root.

For example:
- `@docs/general/agent-rules/python-rules.md` → `docs/general/agent-rules/python-rules.md`
- `@shortcut:implement-spec.md` → `docs/general/agent-shortcuts/shortcut:implement-spec.md`

When you see these `@docs/...` or `@shortcut:...` references in the documentation, resolve them relative to the project root directory.

### Reading Strategy

1. **Start with overview**: Read `docs/docs-overview.md` to understand available documentation
2. **Check development setup**: Read `docs/development.md` for build/test/lint workflows
3. **Load relevant rules**: Based on the task, read specific rules from `docs/general/agent-rules/`
4. **Check active specs**: Look in `docs/project/specs/active/` for related work
5. **Use shortcuts**: Reference shortcuts from `docs/general/agent-shortcuts/` for structured workflows

## Key Documentation Files

After initialization, these files are available:

**Essential Docs:**
- `docs/docs-overview.md` - Start here! Overview of all documentation
- `docs/development.md` - Project setup, build, test, lint workflows

**General Rules** (in `docs/general/agent-rules/`):
- `general-coding-rules.md` - Universal coding standards
- `general-testing-rules.md` - Testing best practices
- `typescript-rules.md` - TypeScript-specific rules
- `python-rules.md` - Python-specific rules
- `convex-rules.md` - Convex database rules
- And more language/framework specific rules

**Shortcuts** (in `docs/general/agent-shortcuts/`):
- `shortcut:new-plan-spec.md` - Create feature planning document
- `shortcut:implement-spec.md` - Implement from specification
- `shortcut:commit-code.md` - Pre-commit validation workflow
- `shortcut:create-pr-*.md` - Pull request workflows
- And more task-specific shortcuts

**Project Docs** (in `docs/project/`):
- `specs/active/` - Current feature specifications
- `specs/done/` - Completed specs (historical reference)
- `architecture/` - System design documentation
- `flows/` - System flows documentation
- `research/` - Technical research notes

A note on flows. A flow is a like a mini architecture doc that describes the lifecycle of a behavior in the code base. For example, bootstraping a system could be a flow. The lifecylce of a particular API request could be another. Flows are meant to help llms and humans quickly recapture context on a particular part of the code. 

## Updating Documentation

To sync with the latest Speculate documentation:

```bash
node ~/.claude/skills/dev.speculate/scripts/update.js
```

This updates the `docs/general/` folder while preserving:
- Your `docs/development.md`
- Your project-specific docs in `docs/project/`
- Any local customizations

## Workflow Integration

### Before Every Task

1. Check if docs are initialized (run install.js if needed)
2. Read `docs/docs-overview.md` for context
3. Read `docs/development.md` for build/test workflows
4. Identify relevant rules and shortcuts for the task

### During Development

- Follow coding rules from `docs/general/agent-rules/`
- Use shortcuts for structured workflows (planning, implementation, commits, PRs)
- Create specs in `docs/project/specs/active/` for new features
- Document architecture decisions in `docs/project/architecture/`
- Document new flows in `docs/project/flows/`

### For Spec-Driven Development

Use the structured workflow:
1. **Plan**: Use `@shortcut:new-plan-spec.md` to create a feature plan
2. **Design**: Use `@shortcut:new-implementation-spec.md` for implementation details
3. **Implement**: Follow `@shortcut:implement-spec.md` with TDD approach
4. **Validate**: Use `@shortcut:precommit-process.md` before committing
5. **Commit**: Use `@shortcut:commit-code.md` for structured commits
6. **PR**: Use `@shortcut:create-pr-*.md` for pull requests

## Customizing for Your Project

After initialization:

1. **Edit `docs/development.md`**: Update with your project's specific:
   - Build commands
   - Test commands
   - Lint/format commands
   - Deployment workflows

2. **Add project specs**: Create specifications in `docs/project/specs/active/`

3. **Document architecture**: Add design docs to `docs/project/architecture/`

4. **Research notes**: Store technical investigations in `docs/project/research/`

## Benefits

This framework ensures:
- **Consistent quality** - Agents follow defined coding standards
- **Structured workflows** - Clear processes for planning, implementing, validating
- **Project context** - Agents understand your codebase and workflows
- **Sustainable code** - Avoid "slop code" through spec-driven development
- **Knowledge retention** - Specs and architecture docs preserve decisions

## Notes

- The install/update scripts preserve your customizations in `docs/development.md` and `docs/project/`
- If you don't have a `docs/development.md`, create one from the sample template
- The `docs/general/` folder gets updated when you run update.js
