# Hacker News Title Skill

## Overview

This skill helps create compelling, HN-appropriate blog titles that maximize your chances of reaching the front page. It analyzes titles using proven HN best practices, generates alternatives, and provides concrete suggestions for improvement.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Asks for help creating an HN title
- Wants to improve an existing blog title for HN submission
- Mentions "Hacker News" or "HN" in context of title creation
- Wants to analyze if their title would perform well on HN
- Asks what makes a good HN title

## HN Title Best Practices

### Core Principles

1. **Be Clear and Direct**
   - State exactly what the article is about
   - Avoid mystery, intrigue, or clickbait
   - Front-load the most interesting part
   - Use concrete nouns over vague concepts

2. **Be Concise**
   - Aim for 8-12 words (50-80 characters)
   - Every word should add information
   - Remove filler words and adjectives
   - Get to the point immediately

3. **Show Technical Depth**
   - Indicate specific technologies, algorithms, or concepts
   - Use technical terminology appropriately
   - Suggest complexity without being obscure
   - Show you've done something non-trivial

4. **Be Authentic**
   - Avoid superlatives (amazing, incredible, revolutionary)
   - Don't oversell or hype
   - Be honest about limitations
   - Match the HN community's skeptical mindset

### What Works on HN

**Strong patterns:**
- Technical deep dives: "How SQLite scales to 4M QPS on a single server"
- Contrarian insights: "Why I rewrote my app in vanilla JavaScript"
- Problem-solving: "Building a distributed task queue with Redis"
- Learning narratives: "What I learned optimizing PostgreSQL for 100TB"
- Show HN projects: "Show HN: I built a compiler in Rust"
- Technical postmortems: "How we debugged a memory leak in production"
- Numbers and specifics: "Reducing Docker image size from 1.2GB to 30MB"
- Year tags for older content: "Understanding Unix pipes (2018)"

**Weak patterns:**
- Clickbait: "You won't believe what happened when..."
- Vague promises: "The secret to writing better code"
- Hype: "The amazing tool that will change everything"
- Overly broad: "Thoughts on programming"
- Listicles: "10 ways to improve your code"
- Personal appeals: "Please check out my project"

### Title Structure Templates

#### Pattern 1: Technical Achievement
Format: `[Action] [Technology/Domain] [Specific Result/Scale]`
- "Implementing ray tracing in 100 lines of C"
- "Building a Redis clone in Rust"
- "Scaling to 1M concurrent WebSocket connections"

#### Pattern 2: Learning/Discovery
Format: `[What I learned/discovered] [doing specific thing]`
- "What I learned building a database from scratch"
- "Lessons from parsing 10TB of JSON"
- "Understanding memory allocation in Go"

#### Pattern 3: Contrarian/Controversial
Format: `Why [controversial opinion about technology]`
- "Why I ditched React for vanilla JavaScript"
- "Why we moved from microservices back to a monolith"

#### Pattern 4: Problem-Solution
Format: `[Problem] and how we solved it`
- "Our API was too slow, here's how we fixed it"
- "Debugging a race condition in production"
- "How we reduced AWS costs by 90%"

#### Pattern 5: Show HN
Format: `Show HN: [Project name] – [concise description]`
- "Show HN: A terminal-based Git client in Go"
- "Show HN: Self-hosted analytics alternative to Google Analytics"
- "Show HN: I built a visual regex debugger"

#### Pattern 6: Technical Explanation
Format: `[How X works] or [Understanding X]`
- "How Git stores data internally"
- "Understanding TCP congestion control"
- "How modern JavaScript bundlers work"

## Process

### Phase 1: Analyze Context

1. **Understand the Content**
   - Read the blog post or ask the user to describe it
   - Identify the core technical contribution
   - Note specific technologies, numbers, or results
   - Determine the target audience

2. **Identify Key Elements**
   - What problem does this solve?
   - What's technically interesting?
   - What's surprising or counterintuitive?
   - What specific results can be quantified?
   - What technologies are involved?

### Phase 2: Generate Title Candidates

Create 5-8 title variations using different patterns:

1. **Direct approach**: State the main point clearly
2. **Technical depth**: Emphasize specific technologies
3. **Contrarian angle**: Highlight unconventional choices
4. **Results-focused**: Lead with impressive numbers
5. **Learning narrative**: Frame as knowledge sharing
6. **Problem-solution**: Present the challenge and outcome

For each candidate:
- Aim for 8-12 words
- Use specific technical terms
- Include numbers when relevant
- Avoid hype and superlatives
- Front-load the most interesting part

### Phase 3: Evaluate and Rank

Score each title on these criteria (1-5 scale):

**Clarity (weight: 2x)**
- Is it immediately clear what the article is about?
- Would a technical reader understand the topic?

**Specificity (weight: 2x)**
- Does it include specific technologies or numbers?
- Is it concrete rather than abstract?

**Interest (weight: 1.5x)**
- Is there something surprising or non-obvious?
- Would an engineer find this technically interesting?

**Authenticity (weight: 1.5x)**
- Does it avoid hype and clickbait?
- Is it honest about what the article delivers?

**Conciseness (weight: 1x)**
- Is every word necessary?
- Is it under 80 characters?

Calculate weighted scores and rank titles.

### Phase 4: Refine Top Candidates

For the top 2-3 titles:
1. Remove any unnecessary words
2. Replace vague terms with specific ones
3. Move the most interesting part to the front
4. Check character count (aim for 50-80)
5. Read aloud to check flow
6. Verify technical accuracy

### Phase 5: Present Recommendations

Provide:
1. **Top 3 recommended titles** with rationale
2. **Scoring breakdown** for each
3. **Specific improvements** made from original
4. **HN submission tips** for the chosen title
5. **Alternative angles** if the user wants more options

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Immediate Disqualifiers
- Clickbait phrasing ("you won't believe", "this one trick")
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
- Emoji (unless showing emoji-related content)
- Questions in the title (usually)
- "How to" for basic topics
- Superlatives without evidence ("best", "fastest" without numbers)

### Warning Signs
- Starting with "A" or "An" (often removable)
- Using "just" or "simply" (condescending)
- Vague adjectives ("great", "awesome", "interesting")
- Missing technical specifics
- Over 15 words or 100 characters
- Generic industry buzzwords

## Special Cases

### Show HN Posts
- Must start with "Show HN:"
- Include project name and brief description
- Focus on what it does, not why it's great
- Example: "Show HN: Terminal-based Markdown editor in Rust"

### Older Content
- Add (YYYY) to indicate year for content over 2 years old
- Example: "How Dropbox stores billions of files (2018)"
- Helps set expectations and context

### Academic/Research Papers
- Keep the original title if it's clear
- Or: "Paper: [Short title] – [key finding]"
- Example: "Paper: Raft consensus algorithm – easier than Paxos"

### Ask HN Posts
- Start with "Ask HN:"
- Be specific about what you're asking
- Example: "Ask HN: How do you debug production memory leaks?"
