# ImageKit Upload

This skill enables uploading images to ImageKit CDN from either local file paths or clipboard contents. The skill returns the uploaded image URL for immediate use.

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, configure your ImageKit credentials. Create a `.env` file in the scripts directory:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/imagekit-upload/scripts
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your credentials:

- `IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your ImageKit public key
- `IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your ImageKit private key
- `IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT`: Your ImageKit URL endpoint (e.g., `https://ik.imagekit.io/your_id`)

Find these in your ImageKit dashboard under Developer Options → API Keys.

## Setup

Install Node.js dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/imagekit-upload/scripts
npm install
```

This installs ImageKit SDK, dotenv for configuration, and clipboardy for clipboard support on macOS.

## Usage

### Upload from File Path

When the user provides a file path to an image, use the upload script:

```bash
node ~/.claude/skills/imagekit-upload/scripts/upload.js --file "/path/to/image.jpg"
```

Optional parameters:
- `--name "custom-name"`: Custom file name (default: original filename)
- `--folder "/images"`: Upload to specific folder in ImageKit
- `--tags "tag1,tag2"`: Add comma-separated tags

### Upload from Clipboard

When the user wants to upload an image from their clipboard:

```bash
node ~/.claude/skills/imagekit-upload/scripts/upload.js --clipboard
```

This reads image data directly from the system clipboard.

## Output

The script outputs a JSON object containing:
- `url`: The full CDN URL of the uploaded image
- `fileId`: The ImageKit file ID
- `name`: The file name
- `size`: File size in bytes

Display the URL prominently to the user for easy copying.

## Error Handling

Common errors:
- **Missing credentials**: Verify `.env` file exists with all required variables
- **File not found**: Check the file path is correct and accessible
- **Invalid file type**: ImageKit supports common image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG)
- **Clipboard empty**: Ensure an image is copied to the clipboard before upload

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User requests to upload an image to ImageKit
- User wants to get a CDN URL for an image
- User says "upload this image" or "put this on ImageKit"
- User provides an image path and mentions ImageKit or CDN
- User wants to upload from clipboard/copy buffer

## Examples

**Example 1: Upload screenshot**
```
User: Upload this screenshot to ImageKit: /tmp/screenshot.png
Assistant: [Uses this skill to upload the file and returns the CDN URL]
```

**Example 2: Upload from clipboard**
```
User: I just copied an image, can you upload it to ImageKit?
Assistant: [Uses this skill with --clipboard flag to upload and returns the CDN URL]
```

**Example 3: Organized upload**
```
User: Upload logo.png to ImageKit in the /brand folder
Assistant: [Uses this skill with --folder "/brand" parameter]
```
