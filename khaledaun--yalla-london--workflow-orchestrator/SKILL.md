## Agent Coordination Protocol

### Agent Hierarchy
```
workflow-orchestrator (this skill — master coordinator)
├── seo-growth-agent          → SEO Domain (8 skills)
├── content-pipeline-agent    → Content Domain (7 skills) + Research Domain (5 skills)
├── analytics-agent           → Analytics Domain (3 skills)
├── frontend-agent            → Frontend Domain (9 skills)
├── conversion-agent          → CRO Domain (3 skills) + Analytics feedback
└── multi-tenant-platform     → Platform Domain (4 skills) — foundation for all
```

### Cross-Agent Communication Rules

1. **Content → SEO**: Every published article triggers SEO audit-on-publish gate
2. **SEO → Content**: Low-performing content (CTR < 1% after 30 days) triggers auto-rewrite
3. **Analytics → CRO**: Drop-off data feeds conversion optimization priorities
4. **CRO → Frontend**: A/B test winners trigger component updates
5. **Frontend → SEO**: Performance improvements feed Core Web Vitals scores
6. **Research → Content**: Discovered topics feed weekly content calendar
7. **All → Analytics**: Every agent action must be trackable in GA4/CronJobLog

### Conflict Resolution

| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|
| SEO vs. Design (e.g., keyword stuffing vs. clean copy) | SEO sets minimum requirements, Design has creative freedom above that |
| Speed vs. Features (e.g., heavy components vs. fast LCP) | Core Web Vitals thresholds are non-negotiable; find lighter implementations |
| Volume vs. Quality (e.g., more articles vs. better articles) | Pre-publication gate enforces minimum SEO score of 70 before publishing |
| EN vs. AR priority | English first for generation, Arabic mirrors with cultural adaptation |
| Multi-site conflicts (same keyword different sites) | Primary site for keyword wins; others use long-tail variants |

---

## Orchestration Decision Tree

When receiving a task, follow this routing logic:

```
1. Is this a multi-domain task?
   YES → Identify all domains involved → Chain skills in dependency order
   NO  → Route to single domain agent

2. Does this affect multiple sites?
   YES → Loop through sites with timeout guard (53s budget for 5 sites = ~10s/site)
   NO  → Target specific site

3. Does this need real-time data?
   YES → Start with research/analytics skills → Feed into action skills
   NO  → Proceed with existing data

4. Is this content-related?
   YES → Always end with: seo-optimizer → schema-markup → pre-publication gate
   NO  → Skip content pipeline

5. Does this touch the frontend?
   YES → Always validate with: accessibility → core-web-vitals → playwright-skill
   NO  → Skip frontend pipeline

6. Is this measurable?
   YES → Ensure analytics-tracking is in the chain
   NO  → Add measurement requirements before starting
```

## Quality Gates

Every workflow must pass these gates before completion:

| Gate | Threshold | Blocking? |
|------|----------|-----------|
| SEO Score | >= 70/100 | Yes — content cannot publish below this |
| Lighthouse Performance | >= 80/100 | Yes — frontend changes blocked below this |
| Accessibility Score | >= 90/100 | Yes — UI changes blocked below this |
| Content Length | >= 1,200 words (EN), >= 800 words (AR) | Yes |
| Schema Validation | Valid JSON-LD, no errors | Yes |
| Internal Links | >= 3 per article | Yes |
| Meta Description | 120-160 characters, includes target keyword | Yes |
| OG Image | Present and valid URL | Warning only |
| Analytics Events | Tracked in GA4 | Warning only |
| Cross-browser | Renders on Chrome, Safari, Firefox | For frontend changes |

---

## Multi-Tenant Awareness

Every skill activation must consider:

1. **Site Context**: Which of the 5 sites? Check `x-site-id` header
2. **Locale**: EN or AR? Check `x-site-locale` header
3. **Brand Voice**: Each site has distinct system prompts in `config/sites.ts`
4. **Keywords**: Each site has unique `primaryKeywordsEN/AR` and `topicsEN/AR`
5. **Design**: Each site has unique colors (`primaryColor`, `secondaryColor`) and aesthetic
6. **Type**: Is it `native` (Next.js) or `wordpress` (WP REST API)?

Never apply a blanket change across sites without verifying per-site compatibility.
