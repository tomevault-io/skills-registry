description: Safe, practical workflows for using Jujutsu (`jj`) in colocated repositories (`.git` + `.jj`) and parallel-agent environments. Use when planning, editing, splitting, recovering, coordinating, isolating parallel agents with workspaces, or publishing changes with `jj`, especially when avoiding destructive history/state operations. Use when this capability is needed.

# Jujutsu Colocated Workflow

Use this skill to execute `jj`-first workflows safely in repositories where `git` and `jj` coexist.

## Detect VCS First

Run this before any VCS command:

```bash
if jj root &>/dev/null; then echo "jj"
elif git rev-parse --show-toplevel &>/dev/null; then echo "git"
else echo "none"
fi
```

Interpretation:

- `jj`: continue with this skill (also covers colocated repos).
- `git`: stop and report that this is a Git-only repository. Ask the user to colocate before continuing with this skill (for example, run `jj git init --git-repo .` from the repo root, then verify with `jj git colocation status`).
- `none`: stop and report no repository detected.

Default to `jj help <command>` for command syntax to keep context lean. Use `Context7` selectively for nuanced or best-practice questions (for example colocation caveats, safety guidance, and version-migration differences).

In colocated repositories, prefer read-only `git` commands and use `jj` for mutating operations.

## Follow Non-Negotiable Safety Rules

- Treat working copy `@` as a real commit, not a staging area.
- Use one workspace per agent for parallel work; never share a workspace path across active agents.
- Refer to work using change IDs when coordinating; commit IDs can change after rewrites.
- Use `jj op log` as the recovery source of truth.
- Treat bookmarks as publication pointers, not a current-branch model.
- Never run destructive history/state operations without explicit written approval in-thread.
- Never edit `.env` or environment variable files.
- Never revert or delete other agents' work without coordination.

## Workspace and Worktree Naming Convention

Use one canonical token for JJ workspace names and Git worktree directory names:

```text
<repo>-<agent>-<task>
```

Rules:

- `repo`: short repository slug (for example `billing-api`).
- `agent`: stable agent identifier (for example `hephaestus`, `reviewer-2`).
- `task`: short kebab-case task slug (for example `token-refresh`).
- Keep names lowercase and ASCII; avoid spaces and punctuation beyond `-`.
- If the same agent repeats the same task, append a short disambiguator (for example `-v2`, `-2`, `-20260210`).

Example:

```text
billing-api-hephaestus-token-refresh
```

Cross-tool policy:

- JJ: pass `--name <repo>-<agent>-<task>` explicitly so workspace identity does not depend on path basename inference.
- Git worktree: pass `-b <branch>` explicitly; do not rely on `git worktree add <path>` default branch-from-path behavior.
- Recommended Git branch shape for agent worktrees: `wip/<agent>/<task>`.

Forbidden without explicit written approval:

- `jj op restore ...`
- `jj op abandon ...`
- `jj util gc`
- `jj bookmark set --allow-backwards ...`
- `jj abandon <shared-change>`
- `jj bookmark delete <shared-bookmark>`
- destructive Git fallbacks (`git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, broad `git restore`, rollback `rm`)

## Use Conventional Commit Descriptions

In `jj`, the `-m` value is the change description (commit message equivalent). Require Conventional Commit format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Allowed types:

- `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

Examples:

- `feat(auth): add token refresh flow`
- `fix(sync): avoid duplicate bookmark tracking`
- `chore(integration): merge parallel agent changes`

## Core Workflow

1. Sync first:

```bash
jj git fetch --remote origin
```

2. Create a dedicated workspace for this agent from mainline, with the first scoped change already described:

```bash
jj workspace add --name <repo>-<agent>-<task> --revision main@origin \
  -m "<type(scope): description>" ../<repo>-<agent>-<task>
cd ../<repo>-<agent>-<task>
jj workspace list
```

3. Create additional scoped changes in that workspace only when needed:

```bash
jj new -m "<type(scope): description>"
```

4. Keep one logical concern per change:

```bash
jj split -i
jj squash --into <target-change>
```

5. Inspect and pick publish targets (plain English):

```bash
jj status
jj diff
jj log -r "main@origin..@" --reversed --no-graph \
  -T 'change_id.short() ++ " | " ++ description.first_line() ++ "\n"'
```

6. Publish selected change(s) explicitly (single PR or stack):

```bash
# Single PR in this workspace
jj bookmark set pr/<agent>/<task> -r <change-id>
jj git push --bookmark pr/<agent>/<task> --remote origin

# Stacked PRs in this workspace
jj bookmark set pr/<agent>/<task>/01 -r <change-id-1>
jj bookmark set pr/<agent>/<task>/02 -r <change-id-2>
jj git push --bookmark pr/<agent>/<task>/01 --bookmark pr/<agent>/<task>/02 --remote origin
```

CI guardrails:

- Push only selected bookmarks. Never use broad push patterns for publish.
- Reuse stable bookmark names with `jj bookmark set` to avoid creating extra CI-triggering branches.

7. Resolve conflicts intentionally (never by deleting peers' edits):

```bash
jj resolve --list
jj resolve
```

8. Retire temporary workspaces after integration:

```bash
jj workspace list
jj workspace forget <workspace-name>
```

## Recovery Ladder

1. Use `jj undo` for immediate local mistakes.
2. Use `jj op log` and inspect prior states.
3. Use operation-level restore only with explicit approval.
