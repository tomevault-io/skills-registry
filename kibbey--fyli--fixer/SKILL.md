# Fixer Skill

Systematically debug issues, implement fixes, and document bugs to prevent recurrence.

## Debugging Process

### Phase 1: Gather Information

1. **Check error logs** in order of priority:
   - `docs/issue.md` - User-reported issues if logs are empty
   - Application logs - Recent errors with stack traces
   - Server logs are in cimplur-core/Memento/logs
   - Combined log output including info/debug

2. **Identify the error pattern**:
   - Error message and error code
   - Stack trace (file paths, line numbers)
   - Timestamp and frequency (how often does it occur?)
   - Request context (URL, method, user action)

3. **Check if this is a known bug** - Review `common_bugs.md` for similar errors

```
Information Gathering Checklist:
[ ] Read error.log for recent errors
[ ] Identify the error message and stack trace
[ ] Note the file(s) and line number(s) involved
[ ] Check common_bugs.md for existing documentation
[ ] Understand what user action triggered the error
```

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Read the code** at the locations identified in the stack trace
2. **Trace the data flow** - Follow the path from request to error
3. **Identify the root cause** - Not just the symptom, but WHY it happened
4. **Verify understanding** - Explain the bug before attempting to fix

Common root causes to check:
- **Data issues**: Null values, type mismatches, invalid formats
- **Schema mismatches**: Code expects columns/tables that don't exist
- **Race conditions**: Async operations completing out of order
- **State issues**: Stale data, missing updates, cache inconsistency
- **External dependencies**: API changes, missing environment variables
- **Migration gaps**: FK constraints, missing indexes, schema drift

### Phase 3: Implement Fix

1. **Fix the root cause** - Not just the symptom
2. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the codebase style
3. **Keep changes minimal** - Only change what's necessary
4. **Handle edge cases** - Consider what else could go wrong

```
Fix Implementation Checklist:
[ ] Root cause identified and understood
[ ] Fix addresses the root cause (not just symptom)
[ ] Changes follow existing code patterns
[ ] Edge cases considered and handled
[ ] No new security vulnerabilities introduced
```

### Phase 4: Add Tests

Add regression tests to prevent the bug from recurring:

1. **Unit test** - Test the specific function that was fixed
2. **Edge case tests** - Cover the scenario that caused the bug
3. **Run existing tests** - Ensure fix doesn't break other functionality

```bash
# Run backend tests to verify fix
cd cimplur-core/Memento && dotnet test

# Run frontend tests to verify fix
cd fyli-fe-v2 && npm run test:unit -- --run
```

> **Full testing standards:** See `docs/TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

### Phase 5: Document the Bug

Update `common_bugs.md` following the established format:

**If this is a NEW bug type**, add a new section:
```markdown
## [N]. [Brief Bug Title]

**Count:** 1

**Error Message:**
```
[Exact error message from logs]
```

**Root Cause:**
[Clear explanation of why this happened]

**Location:**
- `[file-path]` - `[method-name]` (line X)

**Fix:**
[Description and code example of the fix]

**Prevention:**
- [How to avoid this in the future]
- [What patterns to follow]
```

**If this bug already exists**, increment the Count field only.

### Phase 6: Verify and Review

1. **Run the designer skill** (if frontend changes were made):
   ```
   /designer
   ```
   Make changes based on feedback to ensure design compliance.

2. **Run the code-review skill**:
   ```
   /code-review
   ```
   Address any critical issues or improvements identified.

### Phase 7: Restart and Verify

Clear logs and restart the server to verify the fix:

```bash
dotnet run
```

This restarts the application to verify the fix works.

## Log Interpretation Guide

### error.log format
```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "message": "Error description",
  "stack": "Error: ...\n    at functionName (file:line:col)",
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "/api/endpoint",
  "statusCode": 500,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-24 10:00:00"
}
```

Key fields to examine:
- `message` - What went wrong
- `stack` - Where it happened (read bottom-to-top for call chain)
- `url` - Which endpoint was called
- `statusCode` - HTTP response code

### Common Error Patterns

| Error Type | Typical Cause | Where to Look |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| `foreign key constraint` | FK references wrong/missing table | Migrations, schema |
| `column does not exist` | Query uses non-existent column | Repository, DATA_SCHEMA.md |
| `invalid input syntax` | Bad data format (dates, UUIDs) | Service layer, input validation |
| `ECONNREFUSED` | Database/service not running | Docker, connection config |
| `NullReferenceException` | Null access | Add null checks |

## Pre-Completion Checklist

Before marking the fix complete:

```
[ ] Root cause identified and documented
[ ] Fix implemented and tested locally
[ ] Regression test added (if applicable)
[ ] common_bugs.md updated
[ ] All tests passing
[ ] Code review completed (via /code-review)
[ ] Designer review completed (if frontend changes)
[ ] Server restarted with dotnet run
[ ] Verified fix works in running application
```

## Output Format

When reporting a fix, provide:

```markdown
## Bug Fix Summary

**Error:** [Brief description]

**Root Cause:** [Why it happened]

**Fix:** [What was changed]

**Files Modified:**
- [File1.cs] - [what changed]
- [File2.cs] - [what changed]

**Tests Added:**
- [TestFile.cs] - [what it tests]

**Verified:** [How you confirmed the fix works]
```
