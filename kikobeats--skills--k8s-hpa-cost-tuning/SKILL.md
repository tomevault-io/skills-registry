description: Tune Kubernetes HPA scale-up/down behavior, topology spread, and resource requests to reduce idle cluster capacity. Use when users need to audit cluster costs on a schedule, analyze post-incident scaling behavior, investigate why replicas or nodes do not scale down, or reduce over-reservation and wasted compute resources. Use when this capability is needed.

# Kubernetes HPA Cost & Scale-Down Tuning

## Mode selection (mandatory)

Declare a mode before executing this skill. All reasoning, thresholds, and recommendations depend on this choice.

```text
mode = audit | incident
```

If no mode is provided, refuse to run and request clarification.

## When to use

### `mode = audit` — Periodic cost-savings audit

Run on a schedule (weekly or bi-weekly) to:

* Detect over-reservation early
* Validate that scale-down and node consolidation still work
* Identify safe opportunities to reduce cluster cost

This mode assumes no active incident and prioritizes stability-preserving recommendations.

### `mode = incident` — Post-incident scaling analysis

Run after a production incident or anomaly, attaching:

* Production logs
* HPA events
* Scaling timelines

This mode focuses on:

* Explaining *why* scaling behaved the way it did
* Distinguishing traffic-driven vs configuration-driven incidents
* Preventing recurrence without overcorrecting

This skill assumes **Datadog** for observability and standard Kubernetes HPA + Cluster Autoscaler.

## Core mental model

Kubernetes scaling is a **three-layer system**:

1. **HPA** decides *how many pods* (based on usage / requests)
2. **Scheduler** decides *where pods go* (based on requests + constraints)
3. **Cluster Autoscaler** decides *how many nodes exist* (only when nodes can empty)

> Cost optimization only works if **all three layers can move downward**.

Key takeaway: HPA decides *quantity*, scheduler decides *placement*, autoscaler decides *cost*. Scale-up can be aggressive; scale-down must be **possible**. If replicas drop but nodes do not, the scheduler is the bottleneck.

## Key Datadog metrics

The utility scripts query three metric families:

- **CPU used %** — real utilization (`kubernetes.cpu.usage.total` / `node.cpu_allocatable`)
- **CPU requested %** — reserved on paper (`kubernetes.cpu.requests` / `node.cpu_allocatable`)
- **Memory used vs requests** — HPA-relevant ratio

> CPU requested % **must go down after scale-down** for cost savings to be real.
> If memory usage stays above target, memory drives scale-up even when CPU is idle.

## Scale-down as a first-class cost control

When scale-down is slow or blocked:

* Replicas plateau
* Pods remain evenly spread
* Nodes never empty
* Cluster Autoscaler cannot remove nodes

Result: **permanent over-reservation**.

### Recommended HPA scale-down policy

```yaml
scaleDown:
  stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
  selectPolicy: Max
  policies:
    - type: Percent
      value: 50
      periodSeconds: 30
```

Effects: fast reaction once load drops, predictable replica collapse, low flapping risk.

## Topology spread: critical cost lever

> Topology spread must never prevent pod consolidation during scale-down.

Strict constraints block scheduler flexibility and freeze cluster size.

### Anti-pattern (breaks cost optimization)

```yaml
maxSkew: 1
whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
```

Pods cannot collapse onto fewer nodes. Nodes never drain. Reserved CPU/memory never decreases.

### Recommended default (cost-safe)

```yaml
topologySpreadConstraints:
- topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  maxSkew: 2
  whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
```

Strong preference for spreading while allowing bin-packing during scale-down and enabling node removal.

### Strict isolation (AZ-level only)

When hard guarantees are required:

```yaml
topologySpreadConstraints:
- topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
  maxSkew: 1
  whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
```

Do **not** combine this with strict hostname-level spread.

## Anti-affinity as a soft alternative

To avoid hot nodes without blocking scale-down:

```yaml
podAntiAffinity:
  preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
  - weight: 100
    podAffinityTerm:
      topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: your-app
```

Anti-affinity is advisory and cost-safe.

## Resource requests tuning

* Over-requesting CPU = slower scale-down
* Over-requesting memory = unexpected scale-ups

Practical defaults:

* `targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 70`
* `targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 75–80`

Adjust **one knob at a time**.

## Validation loop

Run weekly (or after changes):

1. Check HPA `current/target` values
2. Compare CPU used % vs CPU requested %
3. Observe replica collapse after load drops
4. Verify nodes drain and disappear
5. Re-check latency, errors, OOMs

### Quick validation commands

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get hpa <deployment>
kubectl -n <namespace> describe hpa <deployment>
kubectl -n <namespace> top pod --containers
kubectl top node
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o wide | sort -k7
```

## Utility scripts

Both scripts require Datadog credentials:

```bash
export DD_API_KEY=...
export DD_APP_KEY=...
export DD_SITE=datadoghq.com   # optional, defaults to datadoghq.com
```

### `audit-metrics.mjs` — Cost-savings discovery

Scan a cluster over a wide window (default 24 h) to find over-reservation and waste.

```bash
# Cluster-wide audit
node scripts/audit-metrics.mjs --cluster <cluster>

# With deployment deep-dive
node scripts/audit-metrics.mjs \
  --cluster <cluster> \
  --namespace <namespace> \
  --deployment <deployment>
```

Reports:

- **Cluster**: CPU/memory used %, requested %, and **waste %** (requested minus used)
- **Deployment** (when provided): CPU/memory usage vs requests, HPA replica range
- **Savings opportunities**: actionable recommendations based on thresholds

### `incident-metrics.mjs` — Post-incident analysis

Collect metrics for a narrow incident window and get a tuning recommendation.

```bash
node scripts/incident-metrics.mjs \
  --cluster <cluster> \
  --namespace <namespace> \
  --deployment <deployment> \
  --from <ISO8601> \
  --to <ISO8601>
```

Reports:

- **Cluster**: CPU used % and requested % of allocatable
- **Deployment**: CPU/memory usage vs requests, unavailable %
- **HPA**: current / desired / max replicas
- **Capacity planning**: required allocatable cores for 80 % and 70 % reservation ceilings
- **Tuning order**: step-by-step recommendation (one knob at a time)

### Interpretation notes

- Keep `limits.memory` unchanged unless OOMKills or near-limit memory usage are confirmed
- Use `--out <path>` to save full JSON for deeper analysis or diffing across runs
- Run `--help` on either script for all options (relative windows, custom HPA name, pretty JSON)
