# China Marketing Copilot

Use this skill to produce China-market 3C marketing work grounded in the bundled knowledge base. Treat the repository as a controlled context pack, not as general world knowledge.

## Operating Rules

1. Do not invent numbers, rankings, product features, sources, KOL names, or prices.
2. Mark unsupported claims as `知识库暂无此数据` or `[推测]`.
3. For any product comparison, prefer same-source data. If sources differ, state the difference before judging.
4. Check data freshness before making current claims. Prices, rankings, market share, and new-product specs require fresh verification when external search is available.
5. Keep China 3C audience language sharp and concrete. Avoid corporate press-release wording and generic AI phrasing.
6. Before final delivery, run the quality checklist in `docs/templates/quality-check-tools.md`.

## Resource Map

- `docs/data-index.md`: first stop for data coverage, freshness, and file selection.
- `knowledge-base/{category}/_index.md`: category-level brand matrix, price bands, conclusions, and risk notes.
- `docs/templates/creative-output.md`: campaign ideas, social posts, video scripts, topic plans.
- `docs/templates/insight-output.md`: competitor analysis, data insight, product comparison.
- `docs/templates/risk-assessment.md`: launch, copy, KOL, and comment-section risk checks.
- `docs/templates/new-category-playbook.md`: new-category education and breakout strategy.
- `docs/templates/quality-check-tools.md`: anti-AI-tone rules, fact checklist, confidence footer.
- `docs/references/comment-personas.md`: comment-section persona simulation.
- `docs/references/industry-ecosystem.md`: platform propagation patterns.
- `docs/ecosystem/industry-memes.md`: jargon, memes, overused claims, and avoidance notes.
- `docs/ecosystem/kols.md`: KOL ecosystem and cooperation risk notes.
- `scripts/preprocess.py`: deterministic first-pass cleaning for imported review/comment/spec/risk files.

## Task Routing

### Creative Campaigns

Use when the user asks for ideas, campaign concepts, social copy, seeding, topic planning, or launch communication.

1. Identify category, product, target user, platform, budget level, and forbidden claims. Ask only when a missing input changes the risk materially.
2. Read `docs/data-index.md`, the relevant `knowledge-base/{category}/_index.md`, `docs/templates/creative-output.md`, `docs/templates/quality-check-tools.md`, and platform/persona references as needed.
3. Generate ideas from data-backed advantages, user pain points, comment reactions, competitor gaps, and platform mechanics.
4. Check `docs/templates/used-ideas.md` and avoid repeated hooks.
5. Include quick risk notes and comment-section simulation.

### Competitor Analysis, Product Comparison, and Market Insight

Use when the user asks who is stronger, what threat a launch creates, which product is worth buying, or what position to take.

1. Read `docs/templates/insight-output.md` and the relevant category file.
2. Build a source-aware matrix for quantitative claims.
3. Separate measured data, subjective evaluation, and inference.
4. Return a one-line conclusion, key findings, data support, audience views, actionable recommendations, and confidence.

### Risk Assessment

Use when the user asks whether a claim, creative, launch, KOL plan, or comparison will backfire.

1. Read `docs/templates/risk-assessment.md`, `docs/references/comment-personas.md`, and `docs/ecosystem/industry-memes.md`.
2. Score technical facts, competitor counterattack, platform compliance, comment-section risk, and KOL risk when applicable.
3. Simulate at least one skeptical/拆解 comment, one parameter-driven comment, and one normal-user reaction.
4. End with `直接执行`, `调整后执行`, or `暂停重做`.

### Data Import

Use when the user provides review subtitles, comment exports, specs, or risk notes.

1. Read `docs/references/subagent-dataprocessor.md`.
2. Run `scripts/preprocess.py` when working with a local file.
3. Preserve original wording for user comments and subjective review phrases.
4. Extract findings with source labels and update only the relevant category files.
5. Mark uncertain facts as `[待验证]`.

### Formal Material Review

Use when output may be used in ads, official copy, launch decks, product pages, or KOL briefs.

1. Read `docs/references/subagent-factchecker.md`.
2. Audit every number, product claim, absolute phrase, and comparison.
3. Flag unverified items instead of smoothing them over.
4. Prefer a shorter, safer wording when a claim cannot be proven.

## Output Contract

End substantive outputs with:

```text
自检: {N}个数值已核 | {N}个产品已核 | {N}个来源已标注 | 置信度:{高/中/低}
```

Use `置信度:低` when the answer depends on missing, stale, or externally unverified information.
