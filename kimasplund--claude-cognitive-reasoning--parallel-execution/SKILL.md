# Parallel Execution Patterns for Cognitive Reasoning

**Purpose**: Accelerate and improve cognitive reasoning by executing independent tasks simultaneously. Parallel execution can achieve 2-4x efficiency gains and 70% faster convergence when applied appropriately to reasoning patterns like ToT, BoT, HE, and AT.

## When to Use Parallel Execution

**Use parallel execution when:**
- Problem decomposes into independent sub-problems
- Multiple solution approaches need exploration (BoT, ToT branching)
- High confidence required (ensemble methods)
- Multiple hypotheses need simultaneous testing (HE)
- Time permits depth but sequential execution is unnecessary
- Cross-domain analogies need parallel investigation (AT)

**Do not parallelize when:**
- Steps have sequential dependencies (use SRC instead)
- Each step depends on previous results
- Problem is inherently linear (debugging traces)
- Resource constraints limit concurrent execution
- Merge strategy is undefined

**Parallelization Decision Matrix:**

| Problem Characteristic | Parallelize? | Rationale |
|------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Independent sub-problems | Yes | No dependencies, safe to parallelize |
| Multiple valid approaches | Yes | BoT/ToT branches are independent |
| Hypothesis testing | Yes | HE hypotheses can test in parallel |
| Sequential reasoning | No | SRC chains have dependencies |
| Cause-effect tracing | No | Effects depend on causes |
| Resource gathering | Yes | Independent evidence sources |

## Core Patterns

### Pattern 1: Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS)

**Efficiency**: 2-4x improvement, 70% faster convergence

**Description**: Adaptive parallel exploration that dynamically allocates resources to promising branches while pruning unpromising ones. Unlike static parallel search, DPTS reallocates workers as branches are evaluated.

**Key Mechanisms:**
- **Dynamic worker allocation**: More workers on promising branches
- **Adaptive pruning thresholds**: Thresholds adjust based on best-found confidence
- **Early termination**: Stop exploring when confidence exceeds threshold
- **Resource rebalancing**: Move workers from exhausted/pruned branches

**Integration with ToT:**

```markdown
## DPTS + Tree of Thoughts

### Phase 1: Initial Parallel Expansion
- Spawn N workers for Level 0 branches (N = 5-10)
- Each worker explores one branch independently
- Workers report confidence scores as they complete

### Phase 2: Dynamic Reallocation
- As Level 0 completes, rank branches by score
- Top 2 branches get 3 workers each for Level 1
- Remaining branches get 1 worker each
- Prune branches below dynamic threshold

### Phase 3: Convergence
- Continue reallocation until:
  - Winning branch confidence > 85%
  - OR all branches at Level 4+
  - OR diminishing returns detected

### Pruning Threshold Formula
dynamic_threshold = max(0.40, best_confidence - 0.30)
```

**Example DPTS Execution:**

```
Level 0: 5 branches, 5 workers (parallel)
├─ Branch A: 75% confidence (3 workers assigned for L1)
├─ Branch B: 68% confidence (2 workers assigned for L1)
├─ Branch C: 52% confidence (1 worker, threshold = 45%)
├─ Branch D: 48% confidence (1 worker, threshold = 45%)
└─ Branch E: 35% confidence (PRUNED, below threshold)

Level 1: 8 workers reallocated
├─ A.1, A.2, A.3: parallel (3 workers)
├─ B.1, B.2: parallel (2 workers)
├─ C.1: sequential (1 worker)
└─ D.1: sequential (1 worker)

Best found: A.2 at 82% → New threshold: 52%
→ Branch D PRUNED (48% < 52%)
→ 1 worker reallocated to Branch A
```

---

### Pattern 2: Branch-Solve-Merge (BSM)

**Description**: Three-phase pattern that decomposes problems, solves sub-problems in parallel, then merges results. Ideal for problems that can be cleanly partitioned.

**Phases:**

```markdown
## Branch Phase (Decomposition)
1. Analyze problem structure
2. Identify independent sub-problems
3. Define interfaces between sub-problems
4. Create sub-problem specifications

## Solve Phase (Parallel Execution)
1. Spawn worker per sub-problem
2. Each worker solves independently
3. Workers report partial solutions
4. Monitor for blocking dependencies

## Merge Phase (Aggregation)
1. Collect all partial solutions
2. Apply merge strategy (see below)
3. Resolve conflicts
4. Synthesize final solution
```

**Merge Strategies:**

| Strategy | When to Use | Method |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Consensus** | Multiple workers on same problem | Majority agreement |
| **Voting** | Competing approaches | Weighted score aggregation |
| **Aggregation** | Complementary results | Union with deduplication |
| **Synthesis** | Conflicting valid results | Dialectical resolution |

**BSM Example - Architecture Decision:**

```markdown
## Branch: "Design authentication system"
Sub-problems:
1. Token format selection (JWT vs Session vs API Key)
2. Storage strategy (Redis vs DB vs Memory)
3. Security requirements (MFA, encryption, audit)
4. Performance requirements (latency, throughput)

## Solve: 4 parallel workers
Worker 1: Evaluates token formats → JWT (85%)
Worker 2: Evaluates storage → Redis (78%)
Worker 3: Analyzes security → MFA required (92%)
Worker 4: Benchmarks performance → < 50ms needed (88%)

## Merge: Aggregation strategy
- JWT + Redis + MFA + 50ms latency
- Check compatibility: All compatible
- Synthesize: "JWT tokens stored in Redis with MFA, target 50ms"
```

### Pattern 3: Mixture of Agents (MoA)

**Description**: Layered architecture where proposer agents generate solutions and aggregator agents synthesize them. Mimics ensemble learning for improved robustness.

**Architecture:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 Aggregator Layer                 │
│  (Synthesizes proposals, resolves conflicts)    │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                     │ Proposals flow up
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 Proposer Layer                   │
│  ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐           │
│  │Proposer1│ │Proposer2│ │Proposer3│  ...      │
│  │ (ToT)   │ │ (BoT)   │ │ (AT)    │           │
│  └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**MoA Configuration:**

```markdown
## Proposer Configuration

### Proposer 1: Optimization Focus (ToT)
- Objective: Find optimal solution
- Evaluation: Score-based ranking
- Output: Single best path with confidence

### Proposer 2: Exploration Focus (BoT)
- Objective: Map solution space
- Evaluation: Coverage-based
- Output: Top 5 viable options

### Proposer 3: Analogy Focus (AT)
- Objective: Cross-domain insights
- Evaluation: Structural mapping quality
- Output: Transferred principles

## Aggregator Configuration

### Aggregation Method: Weighted Synthesis
- Weight by proposer confidence
- Identify common themes across proposers
- Flag disagreements for explicit resolution

### Conflict Resolution
- If proposers agree: Boost confidence +5%
- If 2/3 agree: Use majority, document minority
- If no agreement: Escalate to DR (Dialectical Reasoning)
```

**MoA for Multi-Perspective Analysis:**

```markdown
## Problem: "Choose database for new microservice"

### Proposer 1 (ToT): Score-optimized
→ PostgreSQL (Score: 87/100)
  - Best for ACID compliance
  - Strong query performance

### Proposer 2 (BoT): Option-mapped
→ Top 3: PostgreSQL (72%), MongoDB (68%), DynamoDB (65%)
  - PostgreSQL: Relational, ACID
  - MongoDB: Flexible schema
  - DynamoDB: Serverless scale

### Proposer 3 (AT): Analogy-based
→ Recommendation: PostgreSQL
  - Analogy: Banking systems use relational for audit trails
  - Our use case: Financial transactions need same guarantees

### Aggregator Synthesis
Agreement Level: FULL (3/3 on PostgreSQL)
Combined Confidence: max(87%, 72%, 75%) + 5% = 92%

Final Recommendation: PostgreSQL with high confidence
- Optimization confirms performance
- Exploration confirms no better alternatives
- Analogy confirms domain fit
```

### Pattern 4: Graph of Thoughts (GoT)

**Description**: Arbitrary graph-structured reasoning where thoughts can merge, split, and form cycles. More flexible than tree-structured ToT.

**Graph Operations:**

| Operation | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Branch** | Split one thought into multiple | Generate alternatives |
| **Merge** | Combine multiple thoughts into one | Synthesize findings |
| **Refine** | Iterate on a single thought | Improve solution |
| **Backtrack** | Return to previous thought | Error correction |
| **Cycle** | Re-evaluate with new information | Iterative improvement |

**GoT Structure:**

```
     [Problem]
        │
    ┌───┴───┐
    ▼       ▼
  [A]     [B]
    │       │
    ▼       ▼
  [A.1]   [B.1]
    │       │
    └───┬───┘
        ▼
    [Merged]──────┐
        │         │
        ▼         │ Cycle
    [Refined] ◄───┘
        │
        ▼
    [Solution]
```

**GoT Implementation:**

```markdown
## GoT Reasoning Session

### Step 1: Branch (Problem → A, B, C)
Generate three distinct approaches in parallel

### Step 2: Refine (A → A', B → B')
Improve promising approaches through iteration

### Step 3: Merge (A' + B' → AB)
Combine best elements of top approaches

### Step 4: Cycle (AB → AB')
Re-evaluate merged solution with fresh perspective

### Step 5: Converge (AB' → Solution)
Finalize when confidence threshold met
```

**GoT vs ToT Comparison:**

| Aspect | ToT | GoT |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Structure | Tree (no merges) | Arbitrary graph |
| Merging | Not supported | Core operation |
| Cycles | Not allowed | Allowed (iterative) |
| Flexibility | Fixed branching | Dynamic |
| Complexity | Lower | Higher |
| Best for | Clear evaluation criteria | Complex, iterative problems |

### Pattern 5: Self-Consistency with RASC

**Efficiency**: 70% compute reduction vs naive self-consistency

**Description**: Rationalized Self-Consistency (RASC) generates multiple reasoning paths, clusters by rationale similarity, then uses representative answers. Reduces redundant computation while maintaining ensemble benefits.

**RASC Process:**

```markdown
## Phase 1: Parallel Path Generation
- Generate K reasoning paths (K = 5-10)
- Each path solves problem independently
- Collect both answer AND rationale

## Phase 2: Rationale Clustering
- Cluster paths by rationale similarity
- Identify distinct reasoning approaches
- Group paths with similar logic

## Phase 3: Representative Selection
- Select representative from each cluster
- Weight by cluster size (more paths = more weight)
- Eliminates redundant similar paths

## Phase 4: Aggregation
- Combine representatives (not all K paths)
- Apply weighted voting
- Confidence = agreement level among representatives
```

**RASC Example:**

```markdown
## Problem: "Should we use microservices or monolith?"

### Generated Paths (K=10):
Path 1: Microservices - "team autonomy" rationale
Path 2: Microservices - "scalability" rationale
Path 3: Microservices - "team autonomy" rationale (similar to 1)
Path 4: Monolith - "simplicity" rationale
Path 5: Microservices - "scalability" rationale (similar to 2)
Path 6: Microservices - "team autonomy" rationale (similar to 1)
Path 7: Monolith - "simplicity" rationale (similar to 4)
Path 8: Microservices - "tech diversity" rationale (new cluster)
Path 9: Monolith - "performance" rationale (new cluster)
Path 10: Microservices - "scalability" rationale (similar to 2)

### Clusters:
Cluster A (size 3): "team autonomy" → Path 1 representative
Cluster B (size 3): "scalability" → Path 2 representative
Cluster C (size 2): "simplicity" → Path 4 representative
Cluster D (size 1): "tech diversity" → Path 8 representative
Cluster E (size 1): "performance" → Path 9 representative

### Weighted Vote:
Microservices: Clusters A(3) + B(3) + D(1) = 7 weight
Monolith: Clusters C(2) + E(1) = 3 weight

### Final: Microservices (70% weighted agreement)
Rationales: Team autonomy, Scalability, Tech diversity
```

## Integration with Cognitive Skills

### BoT Integration: Parallel Branch Exploration

```markdown
## BoT + Parallel Execution

### Standard BoT (Sequential):
Explore Approach 1 → Explore Approach 2 → ... → Explore Approach 8
Total time: 8 × T(explore)

### Parallel BoT:
Explore Approaches 1-8 simultaneously
Total time: 1 × T(explore) (with parallelism)

### Implementation:
1. Level 0: Spawn 8-10 parallel workers
2. Each worker explores one approach independently
3. Workers share evidence repository (./reasoning/evidence/)
4. Pruning happens after ALL Level 0 complete
5. Level 1: Spawn workers for retained approaches

### Pruning Threshold (BoT-specific):
Keep approaches with confidence > 40%
Do NOT dynamically adjust (conservative breadth philosophy)
```

### ToT Integration: MCTS-Style Search

```markdown
## ToT + Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

### MCTS Integration:
1. **Selection**: UCB1 formula to balance explore/exploit
2. **Expansion**: Parallel branch generation
3. **Simulation**: Parallel rollouts to estimate branch value
4. **Backpropagation**: Update ancestor scores

### UCB1 Formula:
UCB1(branch) = avg_score + C × sqrt(ln(N) / n_branch)
- avg_score: Average score from simulations
- C: Exploration constant (typically 1.41)
- N: Total simulations across all branches
- n_branch: Simulations for this branch

### Parallel MCTS for ToT:
1. Run parallel rollouts from each Level 0 branch
2. Use UCB1 to decide which branches get more rollouts
3. After budget exhausted, select best-scoring branch
4. Recurse with same strategy for Level 1, 2, 3...

### Configuration:
- Rollouts per branch: 10-20
- Exploration constant: 1.41
- Minimum rollouts before pruning: 5
```

### HE Integration: Parallel Hypothesis Testing

```markdown
## HE + Parallel Execution

### Sequential HE (Standard):
Test H1 → Test H2 → Test H3 → ...
Each test may affect others (evidence dependencies)

### Parallel HE (Accelerated):
Phase 1: Generate all hypotheses (8-15)
Phase 2: Identify INDEPENDENT evidence gathering
  - Evidence that affects only one hypothesis → parallelize
  - Evidence that affects multiple → sequence based on discrimination power
Phase 3: Parallel evidence gathering
Phase 4: Synchronized hypothesis update

### Evidence Parallelization Rules:
- Log analysis: Usually parallelizable (independent sources)
- Metrics queries: Parallelizable (independent systems)
- Reproduction tests: May conflict (shared test environment)
- Code tracing: Parallelizable (read-only)

### Synchronization Points:
After each parallel batch, synchronize to:
1. Update ALL hypothesis probabilities
2. Check for eliminations
3. Decide next evidence batch
```

### AT Integration: Multi-Perspective via MoA

```markdown
## AT + Mixture of Agents

### Standard AT:
Investigate Analogy 1 → Investigate Analogy 2 → ... → Synthesize

### MoA-Enhanced AT:
Layer 1 (Proposers): Parallel analogy investigation
  - Worker 1: Technology domain analogies
  - Worker 2: Nature/biology analogies
  - Worker 3: Business/economics analogies
  - Worker 4: Historical analogies

Layer 2 (Aggregator): Cross-analogy synthesis
  - Identify common principles across domains
  - Weight by structural mapping quality
  - Synthesize unified transferable insights

### Aggregation Strategy for AT:
- Principles appearing in 3+ analogies: High confidence
- Principles appearing in 2 analogies: Medium confidence
- Principles appearing in 1 analogy: Low confidence (needs validation)
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Fan-Out/Fan-In Pattern

```markdown
## Fan-Out/Fan-In Structure

### Fan-Out Phase:
1. Identify parallelizable work units
2. Create work unit specifications
3. Spawn workers (one per work unit)
4. Track worker status (pending/running/complete/failed)

### Fan-In Phase:
1. Wait for all workers OR timeout
2. Collect results from completed workers
3. Handle failed workers (retry/skip/abort)
4. Apply merge strategy

### Implementation with Task Tool:

# Fan-out
for approach in approaches:
    spawn_task(
        description=f"Explore {approach.name}",
        input=approach.specification,
        pattern="BoT-L1"
    )

# Fan-in
results = await_all_tasks(timeout=30min)
merged = apply_merge_strategy(results, strategy="aggregation")
```

### Checkpoint Integration

```markdown
## Parallel Execution + Handover Protocol

### Checkpoint Timing:
- Before fan-out: Checkpoint work unit specifications
- After fan-out: Checkpoint spawned worker IDs
- During execution: Workers checkpoint individually
- After fan-in: Checkpoint merged results

### Recovery from Parallel Failure:
1. Load checkpoint with worker states
2. Identify failed workers
3. Retry failed workers only
4. Resume fan-in when complete

### State File Structure:
.reasoning/session-{id}/
├── parallel/
│   ├── fan-out-spec.json      # Work unit specifications
│   ├── worker-status.json     # Worker states
│   ├── worker-001/            # Individual worker state
│   ├── worker-002/
│   └── fan-in-result.json     # Merged result
```

### Pruning Strategies

| Pattern | Threshold | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **BoT** | Static 40% | Conservative breadth, never miss viable option |
| **ToT** | Static top-1/top-2 | Find single best, aggressive pruning OK |
| **DPTS** | Dynamic (best - 30%) | Adaptive to discovered landscape |
| **HE** | Evidence-based | Prune when evidence eliminates |
| **MoA** | Agreement-based | Prune minority positions after consensus |

---

## When to Parallelize: Decision Framework

### Parallelization Checklist

Before parallelizing, verify:

- [ ] **Independence**: Can work units execute without sharing state?
- [ ] **Merge Strategy**: Is there a clear way to combine results?
- [ ] **Resource Availability**: Are sufficient workers available?
- [ ] **Benefit Justification**: Will parallel execution actually save time?
- [ ] **Failure Handling**: What happens if some workers fail?

### Decision Tree

```
Is the task decomposable?
├─ NO → Use sequential execution
└─ YES → Are sub-tasks independent?
    ├─ NO → Use sequential with checkpoints
    └─ YES → Is merge strategy clear?
        ├─ NO → Define merge strategy first
        └─ YES → Is parallelization worth the overhead?
            ├─ NO (< 3 sub-tasks) → Sequential may be simpler
            └─ YES → Parallelize with fan-out/fan-in
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Parallelizing Sequential Dependencies

**Bad:**
```markdown
Step 1: Get user input (parallel) ─┐
Step 2: Validate input (parallel) ─┼─ WRONG: Step 2 needs Step 1!
Step 3: Process input (parallel) ──┘
```

**Good:**
```markdown
Step 1: Get user input
  └─→ Step 2: Validate input
      └─→ Step 3: Process input
```

### 2. Too Many Branches (Diminishing Returns)

**Bad:**
```
Level 0: 20 branches (overwhelming, redundant)
Level 1: 100 sub-branches (unmanageable)
```

**Good:**
```
Level 0: 5-10 branches (diverse, manageable)
Level 1: 5 sub-branches per retained branch
```

**Rule of Thumb**: Total branches = 5^depth is reasonable. 5^4 = 625 is the practical maximum.

### 3. No Merge Strategy Defined

**Bad:**
```markdown
Fan-out: Spawn 5 workers to explore approaches
Fan-in: ??? (no plan to combine results)
```

**Good:**
```markdown
Fan-out: Spawn 5 workers to explore approaches
Fan-in: Apply weighted voting based on confidence scores
        If disagreement > 30%, escalate to DR pattern
```

### 4. Ignoring Shared State

**Bad:**
Workers write to same file simultaneously → Race condition

**Good:**
- Workers write to isolated directories
- Fan-in phase merges results
- Use evidence repository with indexed access

### 5. Parallel Everything

**Bad:**
"I'll parallelize to go faster!" (on a sequential problem)

**Good:**
- Analyze problem structure first
- Parallelize only independent work
- Accept that some problems are inherently sequential

## Quick Reference: Pattern Selection

| Situation | Pattern | Why |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Explore unknown space fast | DPTS + BoT | Dynamic pruning, parallel breadth |
| Find optimal among known options | MCTS + ToT | Simulation-guided depth |
| Multi-source problem decomposition | BSM | Clean partition and merge |
| Need ensemble confidence | MoA or RASC | Multiple perspectives |
| Iterative refinement needed | GoT | Merge and cycle support |
| Test multiple hypotheses | Parallel HE | Independent evidence gathering |
| Cross-domain insights | MoA + AT | Multi-domain proposers |

---

## Summary

Parallel execution patterns provide 2-4x efficiency gains when applied appropriately:

1. **DPTS**: Dynamic worker allocation with adaptive pruning (best for ToT)
2. **BSM**: Decompose, parallel solve, merge (best for partitionable problems)
3. **MoA**: Layered proposer/aggregator (best for ensemble confidence)
4. **GoT**: Graph-structured reasoning with merge/cycle (best for iterative problems)
5. **RASC**: Rationalized self-consistency (best for reducing redundant computation)

**Key Integration Points:**
- BoT: Parallel branch exploration with static 40% pruning
- ToT: MCTS-style search with UCB1 selection
- HE: Parallel hypothesis testing with evidence synchronization
- AT: Multi-perspective investigation via MoA

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Verify task independence before parallelizing
- Define merge strategy before fan-out
- Use checkpoint integration for recovery
- Avoid parallelizing sequential dependencies
- Watch for diminishing returns with too many branches

**Reference**: See `reasoning-handover-protocol` for parallel branch merge protocol and checkpoint integration details.
