name: goal
description: Creates and maintains an agent-owned goal ledger that pairs with long-running coding work, compaction recovery, chained engineering goals, or codebase status tracking. Use when the user says "$goal", "/goal mode", "start a goal", "continue this goal", "chain goals", "agent progress ledger", "flight recorder", "implementation notes", or asks the agent to save progress separately from a PRD. When the runtime exposes a native goal tool (for example Codex `/goal`), couple the file ledger to the runtime goal objective. Keeps `GOAL.md` as the contract and `implementation-notes.html` as the canonical readable state for progress, decisions, validation, compaction resume, blockers, and next-goal links.

# Goal Ledger

Use this skill as durable execution memory beside `/goal` mode.

The PRD says what should become true. The goal ledger records what is currently true during execution. Keep the ledger small and navigable so compaction, interruption, or chained goals preserve execution reality.

## Core Rule

Use one canonical readable state file: `implementation-notes.html`.

Keep current truth in `implementation-notes.html`. A single source of readable state is stronger than several partial state files.

The HTML file embeds its own progress timeline directly inside the page. There is no separate JSONL log to keep in sync. The HTML is the canonical state and the canonical history in one self-contained artifact that opens cleanly as a local file.

Default layout:

```text
.agent/
  GOALS.md
  runs/
    <goal-id>/
      GOAL.md
      implementation-notes.html
      evidence/             # optional bulky proof files linked from implementation-notes.html
```

## File Roles

`GOAL.md` is the contract:

- objective
- finishing criteria
- parent goal, if any
- runtime goal coupling line
- escape hatch

`implementation-notes.html` is the canonical live state:

- top `Resume Here` section for compaction and interruption recovery
- current phase, completed work, active work, blockers, and next exact action
- decisions made because the spec was silent
- changes made because the repo disagreed with the spec
- tradeoffs, shortcuts, and sequencing choices the next reader should know
- validation status and links to bulky proof files
- protected paths and user-owned work
- next-goal candidates
- an inline progress timeline rendered from a `progressEvents` array inside the page itself

`evidence/` is optional attachment storage. Use it only for large logs, screenshots, command output, reports, or artifacts that would make the HTML hard to read. Link every evidence file from `implementation-notes.html`.

## Native Goal Tool Coupling

When the user explicitly asks for `$goal`, `/goal mode`, `start a goal`, `continue this goal`, `goal ledger`, or equivalent goal-mode language, and the runtime exposes a native goal tool (for example Codex `/goal`), use it.

Default sequence:

1. Create or locate the file ledger first so the ledger path is known.
2. Call the native goal tool to create the runtime goal if no active native goal exists.
3. Put the absolute ledger path directly in the native goal objective using the wording from `Goal Mode Coupling`.
4. Keep `implementation-notes.html` current at checkpoints, before compaction, and before final handoff.
5. Append a new event into the `progressEvents` array inside the HTML at each checkpoint.
6. Mark the native goal complete only when the objective is actually finished and verified.

Create a native runtime goal only when the user asks for goal mode. When a native runtime goal already exists, keep that goal and update the file ledger. When native goal tools are unavailable, continue with the file ledger and report that runtime coupling could not be created.

## Starting A Goal

1. Define finishing criteria before implementation.
2. Pick a stable `goal-id`: lowercase words, date when useful, no spaces.
3. Create the ledger with `scripts/init_goal_ledger.py`:

```bash
uv run scripts/init_goal_ledger.py \
  --root . \
  --goal-id "<goal-id>" \
  --title "<short title>" \
  --objective "<one sentence objective>" \
  --mode light
```

Use `--mode full` for multi-step goals. Full mode uses the same simplified file layout. Add `--parent "<previous-goal-id>"` when this goal became possible because another goal completed.

When the script is unavailable, create the same files manually.

## Goal Mode Coupling

When creating or updating the matching `/goal`, include this ledger pointer in the goal objective:

```text
Maintain the agent-owned ledger at <absolute-or-project-relative-ledger-path> and keep implementation-notes.html current at checkpoints, before compaction, and before final handoff.
```

Why: compaction and resumes may preserve the active goal text while dropping conversation context. The active goal must tell the next agent where the ledger lives and that updating the canonical state file is part of the goal.

The helper script writes a `Goal Mode Coupling` section into `GOAL.md`. Copy that line into the actual runtime goal objective when creating or updating the native goal.

## Implementation Notes

When the user uses wording like this:

```text
implement <SPEC> and while you do, keep a running implementation-notes.html file with decisions you had to make that weren't in the spec, things you had to change, tradeoffs you had to make or anything else I should know
```

Create or update the goal ledger, create or update `implementation-notes.html`, and make the notes part of the finishing criteria. Prefer HTML when the user wants a viewable artifact; use Markdown only when the project or user asks for Markdown.

Keep the top section named `Resume Here`. It should be short enough to read in under a minute and concrete enough to resume work immediately.

Recommended `Resume Here` content:

- status
- current phase
- completed work
- active work
- blockers
- next exact action
- last validation
- protected paths and user-owned work

Keep a section named `Progress Timeline`. It renders directly from the inline `progressEvents` array embedded in the page. Append one entry to that array whenever execution reality changes meaningfully.

Recommended event object (appended directly into the inline `progressEvents` array in the HTML):

```js
{
  ts: "2026-05-19T10:00:00Z",
  status: "done",
  phase: "database-hardening",
  actor: "agent",
  summary: "Migration 0025 applied and database types regenerated.",
  evidence: ["evidence/db-reset.log"]
}
```

## Compaction

Before compaction, interruption, or a long handoff:

1. Update the top `Resume Here` section of `implementation-notes.html`.
2. Append a checkpoint event into the inline `progressEvents` array.
3. Record current phase, completed work, active work, blockers, next exact action, validation state, and protected paths.
4. Link any bulky proof files from `evidence/`.
5. If native goal mode is active, make sure the runtime objective still points at this ledger path.

The next agent should be able to resume from `GOAL.md` and `implementation-notes.html` without needing the full conversation.

## Chained Goals

When one goal unlocks another, link them explicitly:

- In the new `GOAL.md`, set `Parent goal: <goal-id>`.
- In the old `implementation-notes.html`, add `Next goal candidate: <goal-id>`.
- In `.agent/GOALS.md`, append both goals with status and relationship.

Why: chained work loses context fast. The relationship is often more important than the individual tasks because it explains why the next goal exists now.

## Status States

Use these states in `implementation-notes.html`:

- `[todo]` - known and not started
- `[doing]` - currently active
- `[done]` - completed and validated
- `[blocked]` - waiting on external input or dependency
- `[incomplete]` - attempted, not fully solvable inside current constraints
- `[abandoned]` - intentionally stopped because the goal changed or no longer pays rent

Use `[incomplete]` only with this full explanation:

```md
- [incomplete] <item>
  - reason:
  - proof:
  - attempted:
  - impact:
  - next human/agent decision:
```

This gives the agent a clean honesty path when a checkpoint is impossible inside the current constraints.

## Escape Hatch

Every serious goal must include an escape hatch in `GOAL.md`:

```md
## Escape Hatch

Pause, ask the user, or mark a scoped item `[blocked]` / `[incomplete]` if:
- validation contradicts the goal
- the goal requires a scope change
- the agent is looping without measurable progress
- the next step risks deleting or rewriting durable memory
- the PRD and actual repo disagree
- the ledger itself contaminates validation
```

The escape hatch is the honesty path for impossible, contradictory, or scope-changing checkpoints.

## During Work

Update `implementation-notes.html` when reality changes:

- after a validation command
- after a meaningful implementation checkpoint
- before handing off to another agent
- before compaction
- when a blocker or incomplete item appears
- when the next goal becomes obvious

Append a single event into the inline `progressEvents` array at the same checkpoints. Write compact events. The ledger is a state surface plus a durable progress log, not a transcript.

## Finishing A Goal

Before reporting completion:

1. Re-read `GOAL.md` finishing criteria.
2. Run the stated validation or explain why it cannot run.
3. Save bulky proof under `evidence/` only when needed, and link it from `implementation-notes.html`.
4. Mark completed items `[done]`, and any scoped misses `[blocked]` or `[incomplete]` with evidence.
5. Update `implementation-notes.html` with final status, decisions, tradeoffs, validation, and next-goal candidates.
6. Append a final event into the inline `progressEvents` array with validation and outcome.
7. Update `.agent/GOALS.md` with final status.

Report the ledger path in the final answer.
