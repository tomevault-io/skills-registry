  Captures session state at context compression. Prompts the agent to summarize

## What I do

I provide a structured prompt for agents when context compression is triggered
mid-session. This creates a handoff document that becomes the foundation for
continuing work in the same session with reduced context.

This is for **continuation**, not **completion**. The agent's work isn't done—
they're just hitting a context limit and need to compress before continuing.

## When to use me

Use when:

- Context compression is triggered (opencode `session.compaction` event)
- Token limit is approaching and work needs to continue
- The agent needs to "pass the baton" to their future self within the same session

Do not use for:

- End of session summaries (use `down-cycle-agent-summarise`)
- Reflection rituals (use `personal-reflection` or `professional-reflection`)
- Memory distillation (that's Anam's domain)

## Output Format

The agent should produce a markdown document with the following structure:

```markdown
# Session Handoff

## Remaining Work

[What's left to do on the current task. Be specific about:
- What was the original goal
- What has been completed
- What concrete steps remain
- Any dependencies or ordering constraints]

## Blockers & Friction

[If stuck on anything, describe:
- What specifically is blocking progress
- What was tried
- What information or access would unblock it
- Any hunches about the root cause]

If nothing blocked you, write: "No blockers encountered."

## Advice for Next Context

### Approach

[Guidance about how to continue:
- Pace recommendations ("go slow, these changes touch critical paths")
- Warnings about complexity ("the auth flow has hidden state, trace carefully")
- What's working well that should continue
- What to avoid]

### Key Locations

[Files and locations relevant to continuing work:
- Current working file(s)
- Related files discovered
- Test files to run]

## Context Summary

[One paragraph capturing the essential state: what you're working on, where
you are in the process, and what the immediate next step should be. This is
what your future self reads first.]
```

## Process

When this skill is triggered:

1. **Pause active work** — This is a compression moment, not a stopping point.

2. **Assess progress** — What was the goal? What's done? What's next?

3. **Surface blockers** — If stuck, document it now. Your future self needs to
   know what was tried.

4. **Note approach advice** — What would help you continue smoothly? Any traps
   to avoid?

5. **List key locations** — File paths, line numbers. Your future context won't
   remember what's open.

6. **Write the context summary** — This is your compressed state. Make it
   actionable.

## Guidance

- **Actionable over comprehensive** — You're continuing work, not archiving it.
  Focus on what helps you move forward.

- **Immediate next step** — End the summary with what to do first when context
  resumes.

- **File paths matter** — Your future context starts fresh. Include paths.

- **Keep it tight** — This replaces your full context. Don't pad it.

## Example Output

```markdown
# Session Handoff

## Remaining Work

Original goal: Implement PUT /preferences endpoint.

Completed:
- Request handler skeleton
- Zod schema for preference updates
- Database query for upsert

Remaining:
1. Wire up validation middleware (current blocker)
2. Add response serialization
3. Write integration test

## Blockers & Friction

Stuck on validation middleware. The `validateBody` middleware expects static
Zod schemas, but preferences are dynamic per-user.

Tried:
- `z.record()` — type system rejects it
- Bypassing validation — works but wrong

Hunch: Check `src/middleware/validation.ts` for a dynamic variant.

## Advice for Next Context

### Approach

Start by resolving the validation issue before writing more code. Either find
the dynamic pattern or decide to handle preferences differently.

### Key Locations

- `src/api/preferences/put.ts:45` — current work
- `src/middleware/validation.ts` — need to check for dynamic option
- `tests/api/preferences.test.ts` — test file to update

## Context Summary

Implementing PUT /preferences. Handler and schema done, blocked on validation
middleware not supporting dynamic schemas. Next step: check validation.ts for
a dynamic validation helper, or decide on alternative approach.
```

## Integration Notes

This skill is invoked by the opencode `session.compaction` hook when context
limits are reached. The output replaces the default summarization, giving the
agent authorship over their compressed context.

**This is NOT the end-of-session summary.** For full session completion with
reflections and repo memory, use `down-cycle-agent-summarise` instead.

```
Context compression flow:

agent working → token limit approaching
                       ↓
         session.compaction event
                       ↓
         final-session-prompt invoked
                       ↓
         agent writes handoff document
                       ↓
         context compressed to handoff
                       ↓
         agent continues working
```
