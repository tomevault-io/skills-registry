description: Synchronize, audit, or repair vendor-neutral agent-workbench files in a project. Use when a user wants every project to carry canonical AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md, thin Claude/Codex/Gemini/OpenCode entrypoints, portable prompts, and portable Agent Skills without depending on a vendor marketplace, plugin, global config, or submodule. Use when this capability is needed.

# Sync Agent Workbench

## Workflow

1. Read `AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md` and `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` if present.
2. Choose the requested workflow:
   - Sync: follow `.agents/prompts/sync-agent-workbench.md` when present, otherwise use the upstream `prompts/sync-agent-workbench.md`.
   - Audit: follow `.agents/prompts/audit-agent-workbench.md` when present.
   - Repair: follow `.agents/prompts/repair-agent-workbench.md` when present.
3. Modify only the files allowed by the selected prompt.
4. Keep `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` manual after initial creation.
5. Keep vendor entrypoints thin and canonical content under `AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md`, `.agents/prompts/`, and `.agents/skills/`.
6. Treat install as first sync: `.agent-workbench.yaml` is human-owned desired config and `.agent-workbench.lock.json` is the agent-owned provenance/baseline ledger.
7. Use lockfile + current desired set to classify removal drift as confirmed upstream removal, confirmed removal with local edits, suspected legacy removal, deselected by local config, source changed / migration required, or local unmanaged. Never delete without explicit user confirmation; record kept removals in `retainedRemovals`.
8. Verify with `git status --short`, `git diff --stat`, and manifest path checks when working in the workbench repository.

## Guardrails

- Do not install marketplace plugins, extensions, global/user-scope settings, or git submodules.
- Do not modify application source code during sync unless the user separately requested application changes.
- Do not create `AGENT.md`; use `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not delete downstream artifacts silently; deletion candidates must be normalized, allowlisted workspace-overlay paths and user-confirmed.
