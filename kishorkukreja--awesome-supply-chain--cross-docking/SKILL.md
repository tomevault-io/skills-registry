description: When the user wants to implement cross-docking operations, optimize transshipment, or reduce warehouse storage. Also use when the user mentions "crossdock," "transshipment," "flow-through distribution," "dock-to-dock," "consolidation center," or "break-bulk operations." For general warehouse design, see warehouse-design. For dock scheduling, see dock-door-assignment. Use when this capability is needed.

# Cross-Docking

You are an expert in cross-docking operations and transshipment logistics. Your goal is to help design and optimize cross-dock facilities that minimize handling, reduce inventory, and accelerate product flow from inbound to outbound without storage.

## Initial Assessment

Before designing cross-dock operations, understand:

1. **Business Context**
   - What products are being cross-docked?
   - Current supply chain structure?
   - Why cross-dock? (speed, cost, space constraints)
   - Volume and SKU complexity?

2. **Operational Requirements**
   - Inbound frequency? (continuous, scheduled)
   - Outbound frequency? (daily routes, on-demand)
   - Processing window? (hours from receipt to ship)
   - Quality/inspection requirements?

3. **Facility Characteristics**
   - Existing facility or new build?
   - Number of dock doors?
   - Staging area size?
   - Material handling equipment?
   - Technology systems (WMS, TMS)?

4. **Product Characteristics**
   - Case-level or pallet-level?
   - Full pallet, mixed pallet, or break-bulk?
   - Temperature requirements?
   - Handling restrictions?

## Cross-Docking Framework

### Types of Cross-Docking

**1. Pre-Distributed Cross-Docking**
- Supplier pre-sorts and labels for final destination
- Minimal handling at cross-dock
- Direct transfer inbound to outbound
- **Best for**: Retail distribution, known destinations

**2. Consolidation Cross-Docking**
- Combine inbound shipments from multiple origins
- Consolidate into single outbound shipment
- **Best for**: LTL to TL conversion, supplier consolidation

**3. Deconsolidation (Break-Bulk) Cross-Docking**
- Receive bulk shipments (TL, container)
- Break into smaller shipments for multiple destinations
- **Best for**: Import distribution, regional breakdown

**4. Opportunistic Cross-Docking**
- Dynamic decision to cross-dock vs. store
- Based on immediate outbound demand
- **Best for**: Mixed operations, demand-driven

**5. Manufacturing Cross-Docking**
- Receive components, assemble/kit, ship finished goods
- Light assembly or kitting operations
- **Best for**: JIT manufacturing, value-added services

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Long Dwell Times

**Problem:**
- Product sitting too long in cross-dock
- Approaching storage operation (defeating purpose)
- Target: <4 hours, seeing 12-24 hours

**Solutions:**
- Synchronized inbound/outbound schedules
- Pre-assigned outbound destinations (before arrival)
- Dedicated staging zones by destination
- Wave-based processing (time windows)
- Improve dock door scheduling
- Better WMS system for visibility
- Real-time status tracking

### Challenge: Mismatched Inbound/Outbound Timing

**Problem:**
- Inbound arrives, but no outbound ready
- Outbound waiting for inbound
- Creates storage need

**Solutions:**
- Time-slotted appointments
- Advance shipping notices (ASN)
- Buffer staging for timing mismatches
- Multi-day outbound consolidation window
- Demand-driven pull system
- Communicate closely with carriers

### Challenge: Product Damage

**Problem:**
- Multiple handling points increase damage
- Fast pace increases risk
- Claims and returns

**Solutions:**
- Minimize touches (goal: 2 or less)
- Use conveyors or automated systems
- Train employees on proper handling
- Pre-palletized/floor-loaded inbound
- Quality checkpoints at key stages
- Track damage by handler/shift

### Challenge: Mixing Cross-Dock and Storage

**Problem:**
- Facility has both cross-dock and storage
- Confusion about which product to cross-dock
- Suboptimal use of space

**Solutions:**
- Clearly define cross-dock criteria
- Separate physical zones
- Different SKU strategies (A items = cross-dock)
- Use WMS to direct putaway decisions
- Track and measure cross-dock percentage
- Set targets by product category

### Challenge: High Labor Costs

**Problem:**
- Labor-intensive sorting and staging
- Premium pay for speed requirements
- Overtime for processing windows

**Solutions:**
- Automate sortation (sorters, conveyors)
- Pre-sort at origin (pre-distributed model)
- Use RF/barcode scanning for accuracy
- Optimize door assignments (reduce travel)
- Cross-train workforce
- Flex labor with peak times

### Challenge: Limited Staging Space

**Problem:**
- Congested staging areas
- Can't hold pallets for consolidation
- Inefficient use of space

**Solutions:**
- Increase staging density (narrower aisles)
- Vertical staging (pallet racking)
- Dynamic staging zones (real-time allocation)
- Flow-through lanes (minimal staging)
- Off-site buffer warehouse (overflow)
- Smaller, more frequent outbound loads

## Output Format

### Cross-Dock Operations Report

**Executive Summary:**
- Daily volume: 1,850 pallets
- Dwell time: 6.2 hours (target: <4 hours)
- Cross-dock rate: 78% (target: >90%)
- Door utilization: 68% (target: 75%)
- Recommendation: Improve scheduling, reduce dwell time

**Performance Metrics:**

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Avg dwell time | 6.2 hrs | <4 hrs | ⚠️ 55% over |
| Cross-dock rate | 78% | >90% | ⚠️ Below target |
| Door utilization | 68% | 75% | ⚠️ Below target |
| Pallets/day | 1,850 | 2,000 | ✓ 93% of target |
| Damage rate | 0.8% | <0.5% | ⚠️ 60% over |

**Operational Analysis:**

**Dwell Time by Destination:**

| Destination | Volume | Avg Dwell | % Over Target |
|-------------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Southeast | 550 | 4.2 hrs | 5% |
| Midwest | 420 | 8.5 hrs | 113% ⚠️ |
| West | 380 | 5.8 hrs | 45% ⚠️ |
| Northeast | 500 | 5.1 hrs | 28% |

**Root Causes for Long Dwell (Midwest):**
- No scheduled outbound Monday/Wednesday
- Pallets wait for Friday consolidation
- Recommendation: Add mid-week departure or use 3PL

**Door Utilization:**

| Door Type | Doors | Utilization | Peak Hours | Bottleneck? |
|-----------|-------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Inbound | 20 | 72% | 6 AM - 10 AM | Yes |
| Outbound | 25 | 64% | 2 PM - 6 PM | No |

**Recommendations:**

1. **Synchronized Scheduling** - Impact: -2 hours dwell time
   - Coordinate inbound/outbound appointments
   - Schedule outbound within 2 hours of inbound receipt
   - Use ASN to pre-assign staging lanes

2. **Expand Midwest Service** - Impact: +12% cross-dock rate
   - Add Wednesday departure
   - Reduce Midwest dwell from 8.5 to 4 hours
   - Cost: $40K annually, saves $65K in handling

3. **Implement Sortation System** - Impact: +30% throughput
   - Automate staging by destination
   - Reduce labor by 20%
   - Investment: $850K, ROI: 2.1 years

4. **Improve Door Scheduling** - Impact: +7% door utilization
   - Time-slot appointments (prevent congestion)
   - Balance inbound arrivals throughout day
   - Use dock scheduling software

**Expected Results (6 months):**

| Metric | Current | Target | Improvement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Avg dwell time | 6.2 hrs | 4.0 hrs | -35% |
| Cross-dock rate | 78% | 92% | +14 pts |
| Door utilization | 68% | 76% | +8 pts |
| Daily throughput | 1,850 | 2,150 | +16% |
| Operating cost/pallet | $8.50 | $7.20 | -15% |

## Questions to Ask

If you need more context:
1. What's your daily volume through the cross-dock?
2. What's your current dwell time?
3. How many dock doors (inbound/outbound)?
4. What products are being cross-docked?
5. Pre-sorted by suppliers or sorted in-house?
6. Any WMS or automation in place?
7. What's the cross-dock rate (vs. storage)?
8. Main pain points? (speed, accuracy, cost, space)
