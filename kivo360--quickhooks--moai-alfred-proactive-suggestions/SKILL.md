## Risk Pattern Details

### Pattern 1: Database Migration

**Detection**:
- SPEC contains "migration", "schema", "database"
- SQL files modified
- ORM model changes detected

**Suggestion**:
```
High-risk operation detected: Database migration

Recommended safeguards:
1. Create database backup
2. Test on staging environment
3. Prepare rollback script
4. Schedule maintenance window
5. Verify migration in dry-run mode

Proceed?
  [Yes, precautions taken] [No, cancel] [Show checklist]
```

---

### Pattern 2: Destructive Operations

**Detection**:
- Commands: `rm`, `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`
- File deletion requests
- Irreversible data changes

**Suggestion**:
```
Destructive operation detected: Force push to main branch

Risks:
- Rewrites shared git history
- Breaks collaborator branches
- Potential data loss

Alternatives:
- Use regular push if possible
- Create new branch instead
- Discuss with team before force push

Are you absolutely sure?
  [Cancel] [Proceed with force push]
```

---

### Pattern 3: Breaking Changes

**Detection**:
- API endpoint signature changes
- Public function parameter changes
- Dependency major version update

**Suggestion**:
```
Breaking change detected: API endpoint signature modified

Impact analysis:
- 3 frontend clients affected
- 5 external integrations impacted
- Migration guide required

Recommended actions:
1. Create deprecation notice (v1 → v2)
2. Maintain backward compatibility for 2 versions
3. Document migration path
4. Notify stakeholders

Proceed with breaking change?
  [Yes, create migration plan] [No, use non-breaking approach]
```

---

### Pattern 4: Production Operations

**Detection**:
- Deployment target: production
- No staging test recorded
- Critical infrastructure change

**Suggestion**:
```
Production deployment without staging verification

Checklist:
- [ ] Tested on staging environment
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Team notified
- [ ] Backup created

Deploy to production?
  [Yes, checklist complete] [No, test on staging first]
```

---

### Pattern 5: Security Concerns

**Detection**:
- Credentials in code
- API keys in environment files
- Public S3 bucket configuration
- Insecure HTTP endpoints

**Suggestion**:
```
Security concern detected: API key in code

Risk: Exposed credentials if committed to git

Recommended fix:
1. Move to environment variable (.env)
2. Add .env to .gitignore
3. Use secret management (AWS Secrets, Vault)
4. Rotate compromised key

Fix automatically?
  [Yes, move to .env] [I'll fix manually]
```

---

### Pattern 6: Large File Operations

**Detection**:
- Editing file >100 lines
- No test coverage for file
- Complex logic modification

**Suggestion**:
```
Large file edit detected: 250 lines modified

Risk: Regression without test coverage

Recommendation:
1. Write tests before refactoring (TDD)
2. Break into smaller changes
3. Use /alfred:2-run for TDD workflow

Proceed?
  [Pause, write tests first] [Continue without tests]
```

---

## Optimization Pattern Details

### Pattern 1: Repetitive Tasks

**Detection**:
- Same operation on 3+ files
- Similar edits detected
- Pattern recognition threshold reached

**Suggestion**:
```
Repetitive pattern detected: Updating import statements in 5 files

Automation opportunity:
- Analyze your last 2 edits
- Generate batch script
- Apply to remaining 3 files
- Estimated time saved: 10 minutes

Create automation?
  [Yes, generate script] [No, continue manually]
```

---

### Pattern 2: Parallel Execution

**Detection**:
- Sequential tasks with no dependencies
- Independent test suites
- Multiple API calls in sequence

**Suggestion**:
```
Parallel execution opportunity detected

Current workflow:
1. Run unit tests (2 min)
2. Run integration tests (3 min)
3. Run E2E tests (5 min)
Total: 10 minutes sequential

Optimized workflow:
1. Run all test suites in parallel
Total: 5 minutes (max of 3 durations)

Time saved: 5 minutes (50%)

Enable parallel execution?
  [Yes, run in parallel] [No, keep sequential]
```

---

### Pattern 3: Manual Workflows

**Detection**:
- Performing git operations manually

## Suggestion Frequency Limits

**Non-intrusive constraint**: Max 1 suggestion per 5 minutes

**Rationale**:
- Avoid alert fatigue
- Maintain user flow state
- Prioritize high-value suggestions

**Priority ranking** (when multiple suggestions eligible):

1. **High-risk warnings** (always shown)
2. **Medium-risk warnings** (shown if no high-risk)
3. **Optimization patterns** (shown if no risks)
4. **Learning opportunities** (lowest priority)

---

## Integration with Expertise Detection

**Suggestion threshold by expertise level**:

| Expertise | Suggestions/Session | Focus Area |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| **Beginner** | 3-5 | Learning opportunities + risks |
| **Intermediate** | 2-3 | Optimizations + medium risks |
| **Expert** | 1-2 | Advanced techniques + high risks |

---

## Key Principles

1. **User Retains Control**: All suggestions are optional
2. **Non-Intrusive**: Limited frequency prevents alert fatigue
3. **Contextual**: Suggestions based on current workflow state
4. **Actionable**: Every suggestion includes clear next steps
5. **Educational**: Explain rationale and benefits
