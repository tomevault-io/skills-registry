# CI Code Reviewer

Automated code review for CI pipelines. Designed to run inside GitHub Actions
via `openai/codex-action`, producing a single structured PR comment.

This skill extends `.skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md` with CI-specific
adaptations: no interactive prompts, PR description validation, manifest
pre-checks, and concise output formatting for automated comments.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Running automated code review in GitHub Actions (Codex CI pipeline)
- Reviewing PRs that transition from draft to ready-for-review
- Performing non-interactive, autonomous code review

Do NOT use for:
- Interactive human-guided code review (use `code-reviewer` skill instead)
- Reviewing plans/specs (use `plan-reviewer` skill)
- Implementation tasks

---

## Required Context

Before starting the review, read:
1. `AGENTS.md` -- architecture boundaries and coding conventions
2. `.skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md` -- severity model and review baseline

If any file is missing, note it in the output and continue with available context.

---

## Severity Model (Use in PR Comments)

Classify findings using these levels, and include the level in each finding:

- **Blocker:** Merge must not proceed
- **Must fix:** Should be fixed before merge unless explicitly accepted as debt
- **Should fix:** Important, but can be deferred with clear rationale
- **Nit:** Ignore by default; mention only if specifically requested

Rule: avoid comment-only style polish and trivial corrections. Prefer high signal.

---

## Review Process

### Step 0: PR Description Validation (Mandatory)

This step is mandatory and must appear first in the output.

Check the PR description for:

1. **Good explanation**: WHAT changed and WHY it is needed.
2. **OR link/path to plan file**: for example `.quest/*/phase_01_plan/plan.md`
   or `docs/implementation/...`.

If neither condition is met:
- **Must fix**: "PR description is missing. Add what/why context or link to a readable implementation plan."

If description exists but is very thin (fewer than ~20 words, little context):
- **Should fix**: "PR description is sparse. Add more context about purpose and approach."

### Step 0.1: Manifest Validation (Mandatory)

Run `./scripts/validate-manifest.sh`.

- If it fails, flag **Must fix** with the failing file/path details.
- If PR adds or renames files under Quest-managed paths, verify `.quest-manifest`
  is updated in the diff.

### Step 0.5: Implementation Alignment

Verify that what the PR implements matches what it claims to do.
Use the best available source of intent, in priority order:

1. **Plan file** referenced in PR description (preferred)
2. **Acceptance criteria** listed in PR description
3. **PR description intent** (what + why) if no explicit AC

Missing plan file is not a reason to skip alignment. Fall back to description.

Compare expectations vs diff:
- Expected deliverable missing from diff -> **Must fix**
- Out-of-scope file changes not justified by tests/docs/config support -> **Should fix**
- Missing explicit acceptance criteria in PR description -> **Should fix**

For each acceptance criterion:
- Automated criterion missing code/test evidence -> **Must fix**
- Manual-only criterion -> mark `manual - not verified`
- Unclear from diff -> mark `unclear - needs human review`

If all criteria align, stay silent on this section.

### Step 1: Identify Changed Files and Scope

1. Run `git diff --name-only <base>...<head>`.
2. Run `git diff --stat <base>...<head>`.
3. Categorize changed files into:
   - Skills (`.skills/`, including `.skills/quest/`)
   - AI roles/config (`.ai/`)
   - Scripts (`scripts/`)
   - Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
   - Documentation (`docs/`, `AGENTS.md`, quest markdown artifacts)

Use these categories to decide which boundary checks and quality checks apply.

### Step 2: Architecture Boundaries

Apply Quest boundaries from `AGENTS.md`:

- `.skills/`: skill definitions, review protocols, delegation docs
- `.ai/`: agent roles, templates, schemas, allowlist/context config
- `scripts/`: validation and utility shell scripts
- `.github/`: CI and repository automation config (especially workflow orchestration)
- `docs/`: documentation and guidance, no executable logic

For each changed file, verify:
- Changes stay within directory responsibility
- No cross-layer leakage (for example: embedding workflow logic into docs)
- Dependencies and references are appropriate to the layer

Boundary violations are **Must fix** or **Blocker** depending on severity.

### Step 3: Correctness and Contracts

Review for:
- Correct trigger/behavior semantics
- Config contract compatibility
- Data/config invariants
- Edge cases and failure semantics

Focus on behavior correctness, not style preferences.

### Step 4: Security Hygiene

PR-focused checks:
- No secrets in code, logs, or responses
- No sensitive data in errors
- Input/path validation at trust boundaries
- No hardcoded API keys or long-lived tokens

Secret leakage is always **Blocker**.

### Step 5: Test Coverage (Map to Acceptance Criteria)

If acceptance criteria are available from Step 0.5:
1. Map each automated criterion to tests or validation evidence.
2. If missing, flag as **Must fix**.

For workflow/config/skill-only changes, acceptable evidence can include:
- `./scripts/validate-manifest.sh`
- `./scripts/validate-quest-config.sh`
- Manual GitHub runtime verification steps when CI event behavior is required

If no criteria are available:
- Check that meaningful logic/config changes include corresponding validation
  updates or explicit rationale. Missing validation -> **Should fix**.

### Step 6: Code Quality and Maintainability

Review for clarity, maintainability, and consistency with existing patterns.

Markdown and YAML:
- Valid, consistent structure and headings
- Stable key names/ordering when convention exists
- No ambiguous indentation or malformed frontmatter

Shell scripts:
- Safe quoting and robust conditionals
- Avoid unsafe globbing and unbounded command behavior
- Portability and clear error handling

JSON/schema/config integrity:
- Schema references and paths are valid
- Config keys are spelled correctly and supported
- New files are registered where required (`.quest-manifest`, skill index)

Apply minimal diff principle: smallest correct change, no speculative refactors.

## Output Format

Keep output concise. Omit sections with no findings.

```
**PR Description:** PASS | FAIL - one-line explanation

**Summary:** 1-3 bullets. Recommendation: APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES

**Findings** (only sections with issues):

**Blocker** - [path] Description and suggested fix
**Must fix** - [path] Description and suggested fix
**Should fix** - [path] Description and suggested fix

**Plan alignment** (only if gaps/scope creep found): list issues
**Test gaps** (only if gaps found): list missing coverage
**Architecture** (only if violations found): list violations
```

Line number guidance:
- Include `path:line` when the line comes from the diff.
- Otherwise use `path` alone.
- Do not guess line numbers.

Brevity rules:
- Clean review output should be short (PR description line + summary + APPROVE).
- Do not pad with empty PASS sections.
- Keep total output under 30 lines when possible.

## Signature

Append this block at the end of every PR review comment:

```html
<pre>
     ▐▛███▜▌
    ▝▜█████▛▘
      ▘▘ ▝▝
<agent name and model> in Collaboration with <github username>
</pre>
```

Replace agent name/model and github username with the actual values.

## Principles

1. Correctness over style
2. Boundaries are enforced
3. Tests map to acceptance criteria
4. Security hygiene is non-negotiable
5. Minimal diff and high signal feedback
6. Autonomous operation (no interactive prompts)
7. Explicit severity on every finding
