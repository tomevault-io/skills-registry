# Google Drive Document Access

## Overview

Search for and download documents from Google Drive using rclone. Google Docs are automatically exported as Markdown for easy reading and processing.

Scripts are located at `scripts/`.

**Reference Documentation:**
- [scripts/](scripts/) — Shell scripts for search, download, and sync operations
- [digital-science-reference.md](digital-science-reference.md) — Digital Science documentation links

**Authentication:** See the Authentication section in [digital-science-reference.md](digital-science-reference.md) for rclone setup. The remote must be named `gdrive`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check rclone is configured
./scripts/check_rclone.sh

# Search for files
./scripts/search_gdrive.sh "meeting notes"

# Search shared files
./scripts/search_gdrive.sh "standup" --shared

# Download a file (exports Google Docs as Markdown)
./scripts/download_gdrive.sh "Documents/Report" ./output

# Download by file ID
./scripts/download_gdrive.sh --id "FILE_ID" ./output

# Download matching shared files
./scripts/download_gdrive.sh --shared --include "pattern*" ./output
```

## Common Tasks

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Check setup | `./scripts/check_rclone.sh` |
| Search files | `./scripts/search_gdrive.sh "pattern"` |
| Search shared files | `./scripts/search_gdrive.sh "pattern" --shared` |
| Download file | `./scripts/download_gdrive.sh "path/to/file" ./output` |
| Download by ID | `./scripts/download_gdrive.sh --id "FILE_ID" ./output` |
| Download folder | `./scripts/download_gdrive.sh "Folder" ./output --bulk` |
| Download shared files | `./scripts/download_gdrive.sh --shared --include "pattern*" ./output` |
| Limit downloads | `./scripts/download_gdrive.sh --shared --include "pattern*" ./output --limit 20` |

## Export Formats

Google Docs can be exported in different formats:

| Format | Flag | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|
| Markdown | `--format md` (default) | Easy reading and processing |
| Word | `--format docx` | Office compatibility |
| PDF | `--format pdf` | Final documents |
| Plain text | `--format txt` | Minimal formatting |
| HTML | `--format html` | Web content |

Example: `./scripts/download_gdrive.sh "Report" ./output --format docx`

## File ID Extraction

Extract file IDs from Google Drive URLs:
- `https://docs.google.com/document/d/FILE_ID/edit` → use FILE_ID
- `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view` → use FILE_ID

## Preview Before Download

Use dry-run to see what would be downloaded:
```bash
./scripts/download_gdrive.sh "Large Folder" ./output --bulk --dry-run
```

## Direct rclone Commands

For advanced use cases:
```bash
rclone ls gdrive:"Documents"           # List files
rclone lsjson gdrive:"path" --no-traverse  # Get file info as JSON
rclone sync gdrive:"Source" ./local --drive-export-formats md  # Sync folder
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "remote not configured" | Run `rclone config` to set up gdrive remote |
| "Cannot connect" | Run `rclone config reconnect gdrive:` |
| Empty search results | Check path spelling; try searching from root |
| File not downloading | Verify file permissions; check if file is in Trash |
| Shared files not found | Use `--shared` flag |
| Too many files | Use `--limit N` to download only N most recent |
