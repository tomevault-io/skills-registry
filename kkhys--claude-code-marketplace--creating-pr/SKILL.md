# Creating PR

## Title Format

```
[base-branch] type: description
```

The base branch name goes in brackets, followed by a Conventional Commits type and a lowercase description. This format makes it immediately clear where the PR targets and what kind of change it is when scanning a PR list.

**Examples:**
- `[main] feat: add user authentication system`
- `[develop] fix: resolve null pointer in login handler`
- `[main] refactor: extract validation logic`

## Type Selection

When changes span multiple types, select by primary purpose:

feat > fix > perf > refactor > test > docs > style > ci > build > chore

A feature branch that includes bug fixes and tests is still `feat`. A bug fix with some refactoring is still `fix`. Choose the type that captures the main intent.

## PR Template

Before generating a description, check if the repository has a PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md` or similar standard locations). If found, use it as the body structure and fill in sections based on the actual changes. If multiple templates exist, ask the user which to use.

## Body

When no template exists, write a flat bullet-point list in English. Each bullet uses imperative mood ("Add", "Fix", "Remove", "Update") and describes one concrete change. No headings, no "Summary" / "Test plan" sections, no sub-bullets — just a plain list. Aim for 3-5 bullets that capture the meaningful changes; omit trivial ones.

Good:
```
- Switch image discovery from frontmatter field to directory-based auto-detection
- Consolidate getImage/getImages into getImagesForMemo
- Remove images field from content schema
```

Bad (too verbose, has sections):
```
## Summary
画像取得をフロントマターの images フィールドによる明示的なリスト指定から、ディレクトリベースの自動検出方式に変更

## Test plan
- ローカルで pnpm dev を実行し、画像付きメモが正しく表示されることを確認
```

## Base Branch

Use `--base <branch>` to explicitly set the merge target. Determine the base branch from:
1. User's explicit instruction (e.g., "develop にマージ")
2. The branch the current branch was created from
3. Default to `main`

The base branch name also goes into the title brackets: `[develop] fix: ...`

## Required Flags

Always use these flags with `gh pr create`:

- `--draft` — All PRs start as drafts. This gives the author a chance to self-review before requesting reviews.
- `--assignee kkhys` — Always assign to kkhys.

## After Creation

Print the PR URL returned by `gh pr create` so the user can open it directly.
