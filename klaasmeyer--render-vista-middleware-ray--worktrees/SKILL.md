# Git Worktrees

Git worktrees create isolated workspaces sharing the same repository, allowing work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching.

**Primary tool:** `bd worktree` - handles git worktree + beads integration automatically.

---

## When to Use

- Parallel subagents need filesystem isolation
- Feature work that shouldn't affect current workspace
- Separate builds/servers running simultaneously
- Before executing implementation plans

---

## Creating a Worktree

Use `bd worktree create` - it handles everything:

```bash
bd worktree create feature-auth
```

**What it does automatically:**
1. Creates git worktree at `./<name>` (or `.worktrees/<name>` if configured)
2. Sets up `.beads/redirect` pointing to main repo's database
3. Adds worktree path to `.gitignore`

**With custom branch name:**
```bash
bd worktree create bugfix --branch fix-123
```

**At specific path:**
```bash
bd worktree create .worktrees/feature-auth
```

---

## After Creation

### 1. Enter Worktree

```bash
cd feature-auth  # or .worktrees/feature-auth
```

### 2. Verify Baseline

```bash
cabal test  # Verify tests pass
```

**If tests fail:** Report failures, ask whether to proceed.

### 3. Verify Beads Shared

```bash
bd ready  # Should show same beads as main workspace
```

---

## Listing Worktrees

```bash
bd worktree list
```

Or standard git:
```bash
git worktree list
```

---

## Removing a Worktree

Use `bd worktree remove` - includes safety checks:

```bash
bd worktree remove feature-auth
```

**Safety checks (automatic):**
- Uncommitted changes
- Unpushed commits
- Stashes

**Skip checks (not recommended):**
```bash
bd worktree remove feature-auth --force
```

---

## Worktree Info

Check current worktree status:

```bash
bd worktree info
```

---

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Create worktree | `bd worktree create <name>` |
| Create with branch | `bd worktree create <name> --branch <branch>` |
| List worktrees | `bd worktree list` |
| Remove worktree | `bd worktree remove <name>` |
| Check status | `bd worktree info` |
| Verify beads sync | `bd ready` (in worktree) |

---

## Why bd worktree?

| Manual git worktree | bd worktree |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Separate commands for git + beads | Single command |
| Manual .gitignore management | Automatic |
| No beads redirect setup | Automatic redirect to main DB |
| No safety checks on remove | Checks for uncommitted/unpushed |

---

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Create isolated workspace
bd worktree create .worktrees/feature-auth

# Enter and verify
cd .worktrees/feature-auth
cabal test  # Verify baseline

# Verify beads shared
bd ready  # Shows same issues as main

# Work on feature...
bd claim auth-001

# When done
cd ../..
bd worktree remove .worktrees/feature-auth
```

---

## Fallback (No Beads)

If beads isn't installed, use manual git worktree:

```bash
# Verify ignored
git check-ignore -q .worktrees || echo '.worktrees/' >> .gitignore

# Create
git worktree add .worktrees/feature-auth -b feature-auth

# Remove
git worktree remove .worktrees/feature-auth
```

But you lose: automatic gitignore, beads sync, and safety checks.
