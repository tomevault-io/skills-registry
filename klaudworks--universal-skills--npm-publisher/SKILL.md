# NPM Publisher

## Overview

This skill provides a complete workflow for publishing npm packages with automated CI/CD. It handles version bumping, git tagging, and triggering automated npm publishing through GitHub Actions.

## Release Workflow

Follow this workflow when releasing a new version with unstaged changes:

### Step 1: Stage All Changes

Stage all pending changes:

```bash
git add .
```

### Step 2: Commit the Changes

Commit with a meaningful message describing what changed:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<Description of changes>

<Optional: more details>
EOF
)"
```

**Important:** Never add attributions to a coding agent in commit messages.

### Step 3: Determine Version Type

Ask the user which type of version bump is appropriate, or infer from the changes:

- **patch** - Bug fixes (3.0.2 → 3.0.3)
- **minor** - New features (3.0.3 → 3.1.0)
- **major** - Breaking changes (3.1.0 → 4.0.0)

If unclear, analyze the git diff to determine the appropriate version type based on:

- Bug fixes only → patch
- New features without breaking changes → minor
- Breaking changes or major refactors → major

### Step 4: Bump Version

Bump the version using npm:

```bash
npm version <patch|minor|major>
```

This command will:

- Increment the version in package.json
- Create a git commit with the version bump
- Create a git tag (e.g., v3.0.3)

### Step 5: Push Commits and Tags

Push both commits and tags to the remote repository:

```bash
git push && git push --tags
```

### Step 6: Verify Publishing

After pushing, publishing happens automatically through CI/CD:

1. GitHub Actions automatically publishes to npm when a new tag is pushed
2. Wait approximately 30 seconds for CI to complete
3. Verify the release succeeded:

```bash
gh run list --limit 1
```

### Step 7: Test the New Version

After CI completes successfully, verify the published version:

```bash
# Clear npx cache if needed
npx clear-npx-cache

# Test the new version (replace 'universal-skills' with the actual package name)
npx <package-name> --version
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

**Uncommitted changes error:**

- Ensure all changes are committed before running `npm version`
- Use `git status` to check for uncommitted changes

**Push rejected:**

- Pull latest changes with `git pull --rebase`
- Resolve any conflicts
- Retry the push

**CI/CD failure:**

- Check GitHub Actions logs: `gh run view --log`
- Common causes: failing tests, missing credentials, npm registry issues
- Fix the issue and create a new patch release if needed

**Version already exists:**

- Check if the version was already published: `npm view <package-name> versions`
- Bump to the next version if needed

## Best Practices

1. **Always review changes** before publishing with `git status` and `git diff`
2. **Run tests** before publishing to catch issues early
3. **Write meaningful commit messages** that explain the "why" not just the "what"
4. **Use semantic versioning** consistently to manage user expectations
5. **Verify the release** by testing the published package

## Pre-Release Checklist

Before starting the release workflow, ensure:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] Breaking changes are documented
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No sensitive information in commits
