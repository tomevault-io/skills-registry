2. [Step 2]

### Reused Instructions
*[Reference to shared instructions]*
```

### Tool Selection

**Read-Only Tools** (planning, analysis):
- `search`, `search/codebase` - Code search
- `changes` - Git diff viewing
- `problems` - Diagnostics viewing

**Write Tools** (implementation):
- `edit` - File modification
- `new` - File creation
- `terminal` - Command execution

**Specialized Tools**:

- `fetch` - Web content retrieval
- `githubRepo` - GitHub API access

**Security Principle**: Grant minimum necessary tools for agent role.

### Handoff Patterns

**Manual Handoff** (user approval):
```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: 'Execute Plan'
    agent: 'Editor'
    prompt: 'Implement the plan above.'
    send: false    # User must click button
```

**Automatic Handoff** (workflow continuation):
```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: 'Validate Changes'
    agent: 'VerificationAgent'
    prompt: 'Verify changes meet requirements.'
    send: true     # Auto-submit
```

**Quality Gate Placement**:
- Before destructive operations (editing, deleting)
- After analysis/planning phases
- Before external tool execution
- When user decision needed

### Quality Checklist

## Orchestration Decision Framework

### When to Create Each System Type

| Approach | When to Use | Agent Count | Coordination |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Standalone Agent** | Single-purpose task, no coordination needed | 1 | None |
| **Handoff Chain** | Linear workflow, sequential steps (plan → implement → review) | 2-4 | Sequential handoffs |
| **Orchestra System** | Structured multi-phase projects, TDD required, quality gates needed | 3-5 | Conductor-managed |
| **Atlas System** | Large codebases (50+ files), parallel work opportunities, context conservation critical | 5-10 | Conductor + parallel |

### Pattern Selection Matrix

| Criteria | Standalone | Handoff Chain | Lightweight Conductor | Orchestra | Atlas |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-----------|-------|
| Agent count | 1 | 2 | 3+ | 4-5 | 6-10 |
| Files affected | <10 | <20 | <50 | <50 | 50+ |
| TDD enforcement | Manual | Per-agent | Simplified | Per-phase | Per-phase + parallel |
| Quality gates | None | Optional | 2-3 | 3+ mandatory | 3+ mandatory |
| Parallel execution | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| Plan file tracking | No | No | Yes (simplified) | Yes | Yes |
| Context conservation | N/A | Prompt transfer | Plan file | Plan file | Plan file + scoped |
| Complexity | Low | Low-Medium | Medium | Medium-High | High |

### Decision Flow
```
Q1: Does the task need multiple specialized roles?
  → NO: Create a standalone agent
  → YES: Go to Q2

Q2: Is the workflow strictly sequential (A → B → C) with only 2 agents?
  → YES: Create a handoff chain
  → NO: Go to Q2b

Q2b (Bootstrap context): Are 3+ agents being generated?
  → YES: Auto-include lightweight conductor (minimum orchestration tier)
  → NO: Standalone agent or handoff chain

Q3: Does the project need TDD enforcement, quality gates, or plan tracking?
  → YES: Go to Q4
  → NO: Lightweight conductor is sufficient

Q4: Does the codebase have 50+ files or need parallel execution?
  → YES: Create an Atlas system (spec inline; /NewOrchestratedSystem for advanced customization only)
  → NO: Create an Orchestra system (spec inline; /NewOrchestratedSystem for advanced customization only)
```

### Orchestrated System Integration
```
Orchestrated System
├── Conductor (.agent.md) — manages phases, quality gates, plan files
├── Subagents (.agent.md) — specialized roles (planner, implementer, reviewer)
├── Plan Files (plans/) — PLAN.md, phase completion records
└── VS Code Config (.vscode/settings.json) — enables subagent invocation
```

**Reference**: [orchestration skill](../orchestration/SKILL.md) for complete methodology

## Integration Patterns

### Skills + Agents
**Pattern**: Skill provides methodology, Agent uses VS Code tools to execute

```yaml
# In agent file
---
description: 'Testing specialist that uses test-automation skill'
tools: ['terminal', 'edit', 'new']
---

Use the `test-automation` skill for test structure patterns,
then execute tests using terminal tools.
```

### Skills + Instructions
**Pattern**: Skill references project-specific instructions

```markdown
# In SKILL.md
## Project Integration
Follow coding standards defined in [project-standards](../../instructions/Standards.instructions.md)
```

### Agent + Instructions
**Pattern**: Agent reuses shared instruction workflows

```markdown
# In agent file
### Reused Instructions
*Framework: [Framework.instructions.md](../../instructions/Framework.instructions.md)*
```

### Prompt + Agent
**Pattern**: Prompt targets specific agent for execution

```yaml
# In prompt file
---
agent: APIExpert
description: 'Generate API endpoint using APIExpert agent'
---
```

### Workflow Chain
**Pattern**: Multiple agents with handoffs

```
PlannerAgent (analysis)
  ↓ handoff: send=false (user approval)
ExecutorAgent (implementation)
  ↓ handoff: send=true (automatic)
ValidatorAgent (verification)
```

## Validation Methodology

### Schema Validation

**Agent Files**:
```yaml
Required:
  - description field (YAML frontmatter)
  - Markdown body with instructions

Optional but recommended:
  - tools array
  - handoffs array
  - model specification
```

**Skill Files**:
```yaml
Required:
  - name (≤64 chars, lowercase-hyphens)
  - description (≤1024 chars)
  - Markdown body with instructions

Directory Structure:
  - SKILL.md is required
  - examples/, scripts/, resources/ are optional
```

**Instruction Files**:
```yaml
Recommended:
  - applyTo glob pattern
  - Clear section structure
  - Examples included

Not required but improves usability
```

### Quality Dimensions

**Completeness**:
- [ ] All required fields present
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] Documentation clear

**Correctness**:
- [ ] YAML valid
- [ ] Glob patterns work
- [ ] Tool names are valid

**Consistency**:
- [ ] Naming conventions followed
- [ ] Structure matches patterns
- [ ] Cross-references valid

**Maintainability**:
- [ ] No duplication
- [ ] Clear organization
- [ ] Version noted

### Cross-Reference Validation

**Check for**:
- Broken file references
- Invalid agent names in handoffs
- Missing instruction files
- Circular dependencies in handoffs

**Tools**:
```bash
# Find Markdown links (note: pattern uses regex, not actual file paths)
grep -r 'LINK_PATTERN' .github/

# Validate handoff targets
grep -A5 'handoffs:' .github/agents/*.agent.md
```

## Common Patterns

### Testing Assets
```
Skill: test-automation (patterns, methodology)
Agent: TestOrchestrator (executes tests, creates files)
Instructions: TestingStandards (project-specific rules)
Prompt: GenerateTests (quick test generation)
```

### API Development
```
Skill: api-development (REST patterns)
Agent: APIExpert (endpoint creation)
Instructions: APIPatterns (project conventions)
Prompt: NewEndpoint (scaffold endpoint)
```

### Security Review
```
Skill: security-audit (review methodology)
Agent: SecurityReviewer (analysis + reporting)
Instructions: SecurityPatterns (requirements)
Prompt: SecurityScan (trigger review)
```

## Best Practices

### Design Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: One asset = one focused purpose
2. **DRY**: Share common patterns via instructions
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Skills load resources on-demand
4. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary tools
5. **Clear Handoffs**: Explicit workflow transitions

### Naming Conventions
```
Skills:        lowercase-with-hyphens (api-testing)
Agents:        PascalCase (APIExpert, TestOrchestrator)
Instructions:  PascalCase (CodingStandards, APIPatterns)
Prompts:       PascalCase (GenerateEndpoint, NewAgent)
```

### Documentation Standards
- Start with purpose and when-to-use
- Provide concrete examples
- Document integration points
- Include success criteria
- Note any prerequisites

### Security Considerations
- Validate tool permissions
- Review terminal command approvals
- Audit external API access
- Check for hardcoded secrets
- Verify input sanitization

## Integration with Other Skills

**Works well with**:
- **repo-analysis** — Understand codebase context before designing customization architecture
- **orchestration** — When asset design requires conductor/subagent orchestrated systems
- **planning** — Create phased implementation plans for complex customization deployments
- **documentation** — Generate comprehensive documentation for designed asset ecosystems

**Typical workflow**: repo-analysis provides context → this skill designs asset architecture → orchestration structures multi-agent systems (if needed) → planning creates implementation roadmap → documentation generates artifact guides

## Success Criteria

Well-designed Copilot customization provides:
- ✅ Clear asset roles and boundaries
- ✅ Appropriate tool permissions
- ✅ Smooth integration between assets
- ✅ Cross-platform portability (where applicable)
- ✅ Comprehensive validation coverage
- ✅ Maintainable architecture

---

**Skill Type**: Architecture and Design  
**Complexity**: High  
**Typical Duration**: Varies by scope  
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of VS Code Copilot customization, agentskills.io standard

**Cross-Platform**: Design methodology works across all platforms; validation requires VS Code for agent testing.
