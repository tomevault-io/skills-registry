## Documentation Best Practices

### Clarity
- **Use clear language**: Avoid jargon unless necessary
- **Be specific**: Use concrete examples
- **Structure logically**: Organize information hierarchically
- **Use formatting**: Bold, italics, lists, tables for readability

### Completeness
- Document WHY, not just WHAT
- Include examples for all key concepts
- Cover error scenarios and edge cases
- Provide troubleshooting guidance

### Maintainability
- Keep documentation close to code (co-located docs)
- Update docs with code changes
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Version documentation with releases

### Audience Awareness
- **Technical documentation**: Assumes technical knowledge
- **User guides**: Accessible to non-technical users
- **API docs**: Reference format, complete and precise
- **ADRs**: For architects and senior developers

## Formatting Standards

### Code Blocks
````markdown
```language
// Always specify language for syntax highlighting
const example = "code";
```
````

### Tables
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data | Data | Data |
```

### Lists
```markdown
**Ordered** (when sequence matters):
1. First step
2. Second step

**Unordered** (items without order):
- Item A
- Item B

**Checklists**:
- [x] Completed item
- [ ] Pending item
```

### Links

**External links**: Use standard markdown syntax with URLs  
**Internal links**: Use relative paths to workspace files (e.g., `docs/`, `src/`, `README.md`)

### Callouts
```markdown
> **Note**: Important information
> **Warning**: Caution required
> **Tip**: Helpful suggestion
```

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing documentation:
- [ ] Purpose is clear in first paragraph
- [ ] Structure is logical and consistent
- [ ] All code examples are tested and working
- [ ] Links are valid (no broken references)
- [ ] Spelling and grammar reviewed
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified
- [ ] Audience-appropriate language
- [ ] Examples demonstrate key concepts
- [ ] Error scenarios documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guidance included

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Don't**:
- Write documentation after the fact (document as you go)
- Use ambiguous language ("might", "should", "probably")
- Assume prior knowledge without stating prerequisites
- Forget to update docs when code changes
- Include outdated screenshots or examples

✅ **Do**:
- Write documentation concurrently with code
- Be specific and concrete
- State prerequisites explicitly
- Maintain docs as first-class artifacts
- Keep examples current

## Integration with Other Skills

**Works well with**:
- **planning** — Document implementation plans and strategies
- **repo-analysis** — Generate comprehensive repository analysis reports and context gathering
- **asset-design** — Create architecture documentation for customization assets
- **orchestration** — Document orchestrated system workflows and patterns

**Typical workflow**: Implementation complete → this skill generates documentation → assets become maintainable and discoverable

**Workflow Example**:
```
repo-analysis (gather context)
  ↓
planning (create plan)
  ↓
Implementation (code changes)
  ↓
documentation (document changes) ← THIS SKILL
  ↓
Code review (include doc review)
```

## Success Criteria

Good technical documentation should:
- ✅ Be discoverable (easy to find)
- ✅ Be comprehensive (covers all key aspects)
- ✅ Be accurate (matches current implementation)
- ✅ Be maintainable (easy to update)
- ✅ Be accessible (appropriate for audience)
- ✅ Provide value (answers common questions)

**Skill Type**: Documentation and Communication  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Typical Duration**: 15-60 minutes (varies by scope)  
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of what was implemented

**Cross-Platform**: Documentation methodology works across all platforms and tools.
