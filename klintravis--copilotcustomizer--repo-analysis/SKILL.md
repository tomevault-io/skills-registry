# Repository Analysis Skill

```
✨ SKILL ACTIVATED: repo-analysis
   Purpose: Deep repository analysis methodology
   Functionality: Structure discovery, tech stack detection, pattern recognition, dependency analysis
   Output: Structured analysis report with actionable insights
   Scope: Portable across VS Code, CLI, Claude, Cursor, and compatible agents
```

## Purpose
Provides systematic methodology for comprehensive repository analysis including structure mapping, dependency identification, pattern recognition, and impact assessment. Essential for informed decision-making before making changes.

## When to Use This Skill
- Analyzing repositories for Copilot customization opportunities
- Understanding codebase architecture before refactoring
- Assessing impact of proposed changes
- Identifying existing patterns and conventions
- Planning new feature implementation
- Evaluating tech stack and dependencies

## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Structure Discovery
**Objective**: Map repository organization and key components

**Steps**:
1. **Root Analysis**
   - Identify project type (API, CLI, library, web app)
   - Locate configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
   - Scan for monorepo vs single-project structure

2. **Directory Mapping**
   - Source code organization (src/, lib/, app/)
   - Test structure (tests/, __tests__, spec/)
   - Documentation location (docs/, README files)
   - Build artifacts and configuration

3. **File Patterns**
   - Naming conventions (kebab-case, PascalCase, snake_case)
   - File organization by feature vs by type
   - Module structure and imports

**Output**: Repository structure map with key directories and file patterns

### Phase 2: Tech Stack Detection
**Objective**: Identify languages, frameworks, and tools

**Detection Criteria**:
```yaml
Languages:
  - File extensions (.ts, .py, .rs, .go, .cs)
  - Shebang lines in scripts
  - Language-specific patterns

Frameworks:
  - Package dependencies (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml)
  - Import statements (import React, from flask, use actix_web)
  - Configuration files (next.config.js, vue.config.js)

Tools:
  - Build systems (webpack, vite, cargo, dotnet)
  - Test frameworks (jest, pytest, xunit)
  - Linters/formatters (eslint, black, rustfmt)
```

**Output**: Complete tech stack inventory with versions

### Phase 2b: Standards Resolution
**Objective**: Discover and match enterprise coding standards

**Steps**:
1. **Scan** `.github/standards/` recursively for `*.md` files (skip `README.md`)
2. **Parse** YAML frontmatter from each file — extract `name`, `technologies`, `scope`, `priority`
3. **Match** standards against detected tech stack:
   - Collect all `scope: always` standards
   - For `scope: tech-match`, compare `technologies[]` against detected stack (case-insensitive)
4. **Sort** matched standards by priority (`high` > `medium` > `low`)
5. **Bundle** as `standardsContext` for downstream agents

**Edge Cases**:
- Empty or missing `.github/standards/` → skip this phase, proceed normally
- No technology matches → only `scope: always` standards apply
- Conflicting guidance → higher-priority standard wins

**Output**: Matched standards summary with key principles per standard

**Reference**: [Standards.instructions.md](../../instructions/Standards.instructions.md)

### Phase 3: Pattern Recognition
**Objective**: Identify architectural patterns and conventions

**Pattern Categories**:

1. **Architectural Patterns**
   - MVC, MVP, MVVM structure
   - Repository pattern usage
   - Dependency injection
   - Middleware chains
   - Plugin/extension systems

2. **Code Organization**
   - Feature folders vs layer folders
   - Module boundaries
   - Separation of concerns
   - Code splitting strategies

3. **Naming Conventions**
   - Function naming (camelCase, snake_case, descriptive)
   - Variable naming patterns
   - File naming standards
   - API endpoint naming

4. **Testing Patterns**
   - Test file co-location vs separation
   - Unit vs integration test organization
   - Test naming conventions
   - Mock/stub patterns

**Output**: Pattern catalog with examples from codebase

### Phase 4: Dependency Analysis
**Objective**: Map internal and external dependencies

**Internal Dependencies**:
- Module import chains
- Cross-feature references
- Shared utility usage
- Common types/interfaces

**External Dependencies**:
- NPM/pip/cargo packages
- Version constraints
- Deprecated dependencies
- Security vulnerabilities

**Dependency Mapping**:
```
Component A
  ├─→ Internal: UtilityB, ServiceC
  └─→ External: express@4.18, axios@1.6

Component B
  ├─→ Internal: SharedTypes, ConfigD
  └─→ External: lodash@4.17, winston@3.11
```

**Output**: Dependency graph with risk assessment

### Phase 5: Impact Assessment
**Objective**: Evaluate change risk and affected areas

**Impact Analysis**:

1. **Direct Impact**
   - Files that would be modified
   - Functions/classes that would change
   - API contracts affected

2. **Indirect Impact**
   - Files that import changed modules
   - Tests that cover changed code
   - Documentation requiring updates

3. **Risk Levels**
   ```
   LOW: Isolated changes, good test coverage
   MEDIUM: Cross-module changes, partial test coverage
   HIGH: Core infrastructure, API contracts, low test coverage
   ```

**Risk Factors**:
- Number of dependents
- Test coverage percentage
- Public API surface changes
- Breaking change potential
- Backward compatibility concerns

**Output**: Impact report with risk classification

### Phase 6: Existing Customization Audit
**Objective**: Identify current Copilot customizations

**Discovery**:
```bash
Check for:
  .github/agents/*.agent.md
  .github/instructions/*.instructions.md
  .github/prompts/*.prompt.md
  .github/skills/*/SKILL.md
  AGENTS.md
```

**Asset Inventory**:
- Count of each asset type
- Coverage analysis (what domains are customized)
- Gaps identification (what's missing)
- Quality assessment (schema compliance, completeness)

**Output**: Customization state report with recommendations
