# CBDB API

Query the China Biographical Database (~500K historical Chinese figures, 7th c. BCE–19th c. CE).

## Critical: Things Claude Won't Know Without This Skill

**API endpoint:**
```
https://cbdb.fas.harvard.edu/cbdbapi/person.php
```

**Response structure is deeply nested:**
```
response["Package"]["PersonAuthority"]["PersonInfo"]["Person"]
```
The Person object contains: `BasicInfo`, `AltNameInfo`, `AddrInfo`, `EntryInfo`, `PostingInfo`, `SocialAssocInfo`, `KinshipInfo`.

**Encoding:** Pass Chinese characters as UTF-8 directly — do not URL-encode into hex.

## Python Script

Use `scripts/cbdb_api.py` for programmatic access (zero dependencies):

```python
from scripts.cbdb_api import CBDBAPI
api = CBDBAPI()

# By name (Chinese or Pinyin)
person = api.query_by_name("蘇軾")
person = api.query_by_name("Wang Anshi")

# By ID (most precise)
person = api.query_by_id(1762)

# Extract structured data
basic = api.get_basic_info(person)      # name, dates, dynasty
postings = api.get_postings(person)     # official positions
assocs = api.get_social_associations(person)  # social network
kinship = api.get_kinship(person)       # family relations
alt_names = api.get_alt_names(person)   # courtesy name, pen name, etc.

# Formatted summary
print(api.summarize(person))
```

The script handles rate limiting, retries, and the nested JSON navigation automatically.

## Quick Reference

**Query by Chinese name:**
```
https://cbdb.fas.harvard.edu/cbdbapi/person.php?name=蘇軾&o=json
```

**Query by Pinyin:** (URL-encode spaces only)
```
https://cbdb.fas.harvard.edu/cbdbapi/person.php?name=Wang%20Anshi&o=json
```

**Query by ID:** (most precise)
```
https://cbdb.fas.harvard.edu/cbdbapi/person.php?id=1762&o=json
```

**Priority:** ID > Chinese characters > Pinyin (Pinyin may return multiple matches).

## Handling Results

**Multiple results from Pinyin queries:** Check dynasty, dates, or other context to identify the correct person. If ambiguous, present options to the user.

**Error response:**
```json
{"error": {"code": 404, "message": "Person not found."}}
```
Try alternative name forms (Chinese vs Pinyin), check spelling, or try courtesy names (字, 號).

**BasicInfo fields:** `PersonId`, `EngName`, `ChName`, `IndexYear`, `Gender`, `YearBirth`, `YearDeath`, `Dynasty`, `Notes`
