# Code Enhancer

This skill enables the agent to perform a comprehensive, multi-domain "Code Enhancement Review"
of any codebase. It produces a prettified, graded report with standardized 0–100 scoring across
23 analysis domains, actionable TODOs prioritized by impact and risk, and structured SDD handoff
for implementation.

Supports **language-agnostic** analysis for Python, Go, Node/TypeScript, Rust, and Java projects.
Can run against **multiple projects in parallel** for cross-repository integration analysis.

## Capabilities

1.  **Project Analysis** — Scan for architectural patterns, externalized prompts, and observability integrations.
2.  **Dependency Audit** — Scan `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`, check for latest versions on PyPI, flag outdated/deprecated/yanked packages.
3.  **Codebase Optimization** — Apply industry-proven methodologies: system discovery, structural smell identification, feature classification, duplication analysis, dependency boundary establishment, and incremental optimization patterns.
4.  **Security Analysis** — Conduct defensive security analysis: attack surface discovery, dependency/CVE exposure assessment, CWE-centric codebase analysis, threat modeling, input flow analysis, authentication/authorization review, and operational security hardening.
5.  **Test Coverage Analysis** — Perform pytest use-case coverage analysis: test inventory, use-case mapping, coverage dimension analysis (line, feature, risk), test intent classification, and drift detection between docs and tests.
6.  **Documentation & Governance** — Audit README.md (industry-standard grading), AGENTS.md, and `/docs`: validation techniques, taxonomy establishment, lifecycle management, and automated drift detection.
7.  **Brainstorming** — Provide structured ideation for UI/UX enhancements and architectural upgrades.
8.  **Concept Traceability** — Implement executable documentation with bidirectional traceability using stable concept IDs embedded in code docstrings, docs, and pytest markers (including `@pytest.mark.concept()` decorators), with drift detection, registry cross-reference, and missing-marker detection.
9.  **Linting & Formatting** — Execute language-appropriate linters (ruff/mypy/bandit for Python, go vet for Go, eslint for Node). Parse and categorize findings.
10. **Vulnerability Scanning** — Integrate bandit, pip-audit, and repository-manager validation. Consolidate into unified vulnerability register.
11. **Architecture & Design Patterns** — Evaluate against industry patterns (hexagonal/clean architecture, SOLID principles, event-driven orchestration) and find deepening opportunities to turn shallow modules into deep ones. Conduct conversational architectural reviews based on ADRs and domain glossary.
12. **Actionable Reporting** — Generate consolidated report with specific TODOs, prioritized by impact and risk, with SDD handoff for implementation.
13. **Pre-Commit Compliance** — Run `pre-commit run --all-files`, detect outdated hooks, parse per-hook pass/fail. Smart pytest deduplication (pytest hooks skipped → CE-016 handles them).
14. **Test Execution** — Detect test framework (pytest, go test, npm test, cargo test, maven, gradle), execute tests with 300s timeout, grade based on pass/fail ratio.
15. **Directory Organization** — Measure files-per-directory density, detect crowded/monolithic structures, suggest logical reorganization into subdirectories.
16. **Language Ecosystem Detection** — Auto-detect primary/secondary languages, build system, available linters, and test frameworks. Adapts all downstream analysis.
17. **UI/UX Quality** — Grade web and terminal UIs using Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics via static file analysis. WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility checks for web projects.
18. **Multi-Project Orchestration** — Run all analysis domains across multiple projects in parallel with configurable concurrency. Per-project reports + unified cross-project summary.
19. **Cross-Project Integration** — Analyze inter-project dependency graphs, detect version conflicts, circular dependencies, and unused internal dependencies.
20. **README Grading** — Industry best-practice scoring for README.md: title, badges, description, ToC, installation, usage, architecture, contributing, license, code blocks, docs references, broken links, length, env var docs, MCP tool tables, deployment docs.
21. **Changelog Audit** — Validate CHANGELOG.md against Keep a Changelog standard using `keepachangelog` library. Check version drift against pyproject.toml, analyze dependency changelogs for version deltas (new features, breaking changes, deprecations, security fixes).
22. **Pytest Quality Grading** — Grade pytest suites against F.I.R.S.T. rubric: naming quality, structure/organization, fixture/parametrize usage, assertion quality, and AI slop detection (duplicate bodies, over-mocking, generic names).
23. **Environment Variable Scanning** — Scan Python source, Dockerfiles, compose.yml, .env/.env.example for all env var usage. Cross-reference against README documentation to identify undocumented variables.
24. **Agent Skill Quality** — Auto-detect SKILL.md files in any repository and grade them using a rule engine ported from skill-check: frontmatter validation, description quality, body structure, link resolution, and duplicate detection. Contextual — only activates when skills are present.
25. **Engineering Heuristics** — Evaluate codebase against battle-tested principles synthesized from 13 industry-standard software engineering books (Clean Code, Clean Architecture, Refactoring, The Pragmatic Programmer, Release It!, DDIA, DDD, and more). Uses contextual activation — domain modeling rules only fire when DDD patterns are detected; production resilience rules only fire for service/API projects.

## Grading System

All domains are scored 0–100 using standardized criteria:

| Grade | Score | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| A | 90–100 | Excellent — meets or exceeds industry standards |
| B | 80–89 | Good — minor improvements possible |
| C | 70–79 | Acceptable — notable gaps exist |
| D | 60–69 | Below standard — significant issues |
| F | 0–59 | Failing — critical problems require immediate attention |

Every grade includes a justification with specific file paths and evidence citations.

## Agentic Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery & Baseline
- **Detect Language**: Run `detect_language.py` to identify project ecosystem (Python/Go/Node/Rust/Java).
- **Assess Structure**: Identify if the project is an MCP server, Pydantic-AI agent, library, or web application.
- **Run `analyze_project.py`**: Detect architectural patterns and score against ecosystem standards.
- **Run `audit_dependencies.py`**: Compare current dependency versions against latest stable PyPI releases.
- **Run `run_linters.py`**: Execute language-appropriate linters against the target codebase.

### Phase 1.5: Tooling Execution
- **Run `run_precommit.py`**: Execute pre-commit hooks, detect outdated revs. Pytest hooks automatically skipped.
- **Run `run_tests.py`**: Execute detected test framework with 300s timeout. Grade pass/fail ratio.

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis
- **Run `analyze_codebase.py`**: Measure cyclomatic complexity, function length, nesting depth, duplication, monolithic files, and module coupling.
- **Run `analyze_security.py`**: Discover attack surface, scan for CWE patterns, parse vulnerability reports.
- **Run `analyze_tests.py`**: Inventory tests, map to use-cases, classify intent, detect doc-test drift, find missing concept markers.
- **Run `audit_documentation.py`**: Validate docs completeness, README industry grading, detect staleness, check drift against code.
- **Run `analyze_architecture.py`**: Evaluate against SOLID, hexagonal, clean architecture patterns.

### Phase 2.5: Structure Analysis
- **Run `analyze_directory_density.py`**: Measure files-per-directory, detect crowded/flat/deep structures, rogue scripts, suggest reorganizations.

### Phase 2.6: Changelog & Environment
- **Run `audit_changelog.py`**: Validate CHANGELOG.md format, check version drift, analyze dependency changelogs for version deltas.
- **Run `scan_env_vars.py`**: Scan all sources for env var usage, cross-reference against README documentation.
- **Run `grade_pytest.py`**: Grade pytest suite against F.I.R.S.T. rubric with AI slop detection.

### Phase 2.7: Skill Quality & Engineering Heuristics
- **Run `grade_skills.py`**: Discover and grade agent skills (if detected in Phase 1). Uses skill-check rule engine.
- **Run `evaluate_heuristics.py`**: Assess codebase against engineering book heuristics with contextual activation.

### Phase 2.8: Knowledge Graph Discovery (Innovation Extraction)
- **Ingest Target Codebase**: Use the `kg_ingest` MCP tool to ingest the local repository into the unified Knowledge Graph.
- **Analogy Search**: Use the `kg_analogy_search` MCP tool to find structural analogues or overlapping architectural patterns from previously ingested research papers and external codebases.
- **Query & Discover**: Use `kg_query` to look up cross-repository architectural integrations and propose new features based on the knowledge graph's existing taxonomy.

### Phase 3: Traceability & Governance
- **Run `trace_concepts.py`**: Scan for `CONCEPT:CE-XXX` markers in code docstrings, docs, pytest markers and decorators. Detect orphans, drift, and missing markers. Cross-reference against AGENTS.md concept registry.

### Phase 3.5: UI Analysis
- **Run `analyze_ui.py`**: Detect web/terminal UI, run Nielsen's 10 heuristic checks, WCAG accessibility audit for web.

### Phase 4: Brainstorming & Ideation
- **Reference Guidelines**: Read `references/` documents to identify gaps in performance, security, and DX.
- **Brainstorm Design**: Evaluate interfaces against contemporary design aesthetics.
- **Evaluate Architecture**: Suggest improvements based on industry patterns.

### Phase 5: Reporting & Handoff
- **Run `generate_report.py`**: Create prettified `code_enhancement_report.md` in `.specify/reports/`.
- **Run `generate_sdd_handoff.py`**: Produce structured TODO items compatible with `spec-generator` → `task-planner` → `sdd-implementer` pipeline. Output to `.specify/specs/`.
- **Categorize Findings**: Group by domain with graded scorecards.
- **Prioritize**: Sort action items by impact × risk composite score.

### Phase 6: Multi-Project (Optional)
- **Run `run_multi_project.py`**: Execute all phases across multiple projects in parallel.
- **Run `analyze_integration.py`**: Build inter-project dependency graph, detect version conflicts and circular ## Best Practices
- **Read-Only First**: Always provide the report and wait for user approval before applying destructive changes or major refactors.
- **Evidence-Backed Findings**: Every recommendation, finding, or proposed change MUST be backed by hard evidence retrieved from the Knowledge Graph using the `agent-utilities-kg` MCP server (e.g., `kg_query`, `kg_search`). You must cite specific file paths, exact line numbers, and existing graph topologies. Never hallucinate recommendations; the KG is your source of truth.
- **Extend-Before-Invent**: When suggesting new features or modules, first use `kg_analogy_search` or `kg_search` to verify if a relevant concept already exists. Always prefer extending an existing conceptual module over inventing a duplicate.
- **Wire or Discard**: Implementations must adhere to the Wire-First heuristic (≤3 hops from an entry point). If a feature cannot be wired directly into a hot path or duplicates an existing concept (Similarity ≥ 0.7), it must be extended or discarded. Dead code is prohibited. When recommending architectural changes or creating implementation handoffs, ensure that the proposed code is fully wired into the system architecture's run path (the "hot path") and does not remain a disconnected stub.
- **Holistic Documentation & Testing**: All SDD handoffs and generated TODOs MUST explicitly require updates to `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, codebase docstrings, `/docs` (including overview pages and architectural diagrams), and `pytests`. Architecture diagrams are critical for building agent context.
- **Ecosystem Focus**: Prioritize standards defined in `agent-utilities` (e.g., loading prompts from `prompts/*.md`).
- **Context Awareness**: Scale recommendations to project size. Do not suggest complex graph architectures for small projects.
- **Assumption Validation**: Validate all assumptions before taking them at face value. Check actual file contents, run commands, verify paths.
- **SDD Dual-Write Integration**: Output reports, TDD specs, and domain designs to the `.specify/` directory structure for compatibility with the SDD toolset. The repository's `.specify/` folder MUST be treated as the **Single Source of Truth**. After generating or modifying any files in the `.specify/` folder, you MUST immediately invoke the `kg_ingest` MCP tool against the `.specify/` directory to sync these changes into the unified Knowledge Graph. This dual-write ensures complete ecosystem parity.
- **XDG Standard Compliance**: For any repository that writes files (logs, configuration, data), automatically verify that it stores these files in the XDG recommended standard locations (`~/.local/share/<app>`, `~/.config/<app>`, `~/.cache/<app>`). Report any violations (e.g. `~/.appname/`) as codebase optimization action items and patch them when permitted.
- **Smart Deduplication**: Pytest hooks in pre-commit are automatically skipped — CE-016 provides richer test analysis.
- **Language Awareness**: Always run `detect_language.py` first to adapt analysis to the project's ecosystem.
- **Per-Project .specify**: When running multi-project analysis, SDD handoffs go to each individual project's `.specify/` folder (e.g., `agents/github-agent/.specify/`), NOT the parent directory. Remember to `kg_ingest` each project's `.specify/` folder after updates.
