# Qbittorrent Download Adder Workflow

**CONCEPT:INFRA-001**

Prompts the user for a torrent/magnet download link and custom save parameters, then schedules and starts the download on qBittorrent.

## Steps

### Step 0: User Interaction
**Agent**: `discovery-agent`
**Tools**: `tun_tm_system, tun_tm_hosts`

Prompt the user for the magnet link, torrent URL, custom save path category, and queue priorities.
Expected: `download_link, save_category, start_immediately`

### Step 1: Qbittorrent Agent
**Agent**: `deployer-agent`
**Tools**: `pt_stack, cnt_cm_compose_operations`

Schedule the new download by calling qbittorrent_torrents with the add_new_torrent action, passing the target link and parameters.
Expected: `addition_result`

### Step 2: KG Persistence [depends_on: qbittorrent-agent]
**Agent**: `deployer-agent`
**Tools**: `graph_write`

Persist workflow results as nodes and edges in the Knowledge Graph.
Create appropriate typed nodes with metadata and link to existing domain entities.

## Output
- Qbittorrent Download Adder results persisted in KG
- Structured report (MD/PDF)
- Audit trail with timestamps and agent attributions
