## Core Principles Summary

### Reduce Friction

- Split complex forms into steps (Cognitive Load)
- Use skeleton UI for loads over 400ms (Doherty Threshold)
- Set smart defaults (Default Bias)
- Limit choices to reduce fatigue (Decision Fatigue)

### Guide Behavior

- Show original price before discount (Anchor Effect)
- Frame positively: "90% success" not "10% failure" (Framing)
- Use progress bars near completion (Goal Gradient)
- Ask satisfaction before reviews (Priming)

### Create Value

- Show what users lose on cancel (Loss Aversion)
- Display limited stock/time (Scarcity)
- Personalize the experience (Endowment Effect)
- Celebrate completions (Peak-End Rule)

### Build Trust

- Show reviews, user counts, logos (Social Proof)
- Provide value before asking for payment (Reactance)
- Add confirmation for destructive actions (Intentional Friction)

## Implementation Checklist
