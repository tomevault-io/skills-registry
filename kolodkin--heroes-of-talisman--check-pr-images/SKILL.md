You are a PR screenshot reviewer that helps analyze E2E test screenshots from GitHub Pages.

## Installation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Checking GitHub CLI (gh)..."

# Check if gh is already installed
if command -v gh &> /dev/null; then
    echo "✓ GitHub CLI is already installed"
    gh --version
    exit 0
fi

echo "GitHub CLI is required but not installed."
echo "Please install it using the check-pr skill first."
exit 1
```

## How to Use This Skill

When the user asks to review PR images or screenshots:

1. **Download and Extract Screenshots**:
   Execute the automated script (it will auto-detect the latest run from the current branch):

   ```bash
   .claude/skills/check-pr-images/download-screenshots.sh
   ```

   Or specify a run ID manually:

   ```bash
   .claude/skills/check-pr-images/download-screenshots.sh <run-id>
   ```

   This script will:
   - Auto-detect the repository from git remote (no hardcoded repo names)
   - Auto-detect the latest workflow run for the current branch (if no run ID provided)
   - Download the playwright report from GitHub Pages
   - Save files to `./tmp/playwright-report/`
   - Extract all screenshots to `./tmp/report/screenshots/`
   - Convert `.dat` files to `.png` format
   - Parse test context from `results.json` for enhanced reporting
   - Generate a detailed summary report with test information
   - Run duplicate detection to identify redundant screenshots

2. **View and Analyze Screenshots**:
   - Use the Read tool to view individual screenshots
   - Compare different screenshots
   - Look for layout issues, visual regressions, or UI improvements
   - Provide detailed analysis of what you see

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Download screenshots (auto-detect latest run)
.claude/skills/check-pr-images/download-screenshots.sh

# Step 2: View the summary (includes test context and duplicate detection results)
cat ./tmp/report/summary.txt

# Step 3: View specific screenshots
ls ./tmp/report/screenshots/
# Then use Read tool to view: ./tmp/report/screenshots/<hash>.png
```

## Enhanced Features

### Repository Auto-Detection

The skill automatically detects your repository from `git remote`, so it works with any GitHub repository without hardcoded values.

### Test Context Extraction

When `results.json` is available, the summary report includes:

- Test titles and file paths
- Test status (passed/failed)
- Test duration
- Screenshots grouped by test
- Mapping between screenshot names and files

### Duplicate Detection

Automatically runs consecutive duplicate screenshot detection using perceptual hashing:

- Identifies back-to-back identical screenshots within the same test
- Uses visual comparison (tolerates minor pixel differences)
- Reports which screenshots are redundant and should be removed
- Helps maintain clean, efficient test suites

## What to Look For

When analyzing screenshots:

1. **Layout Verification**:
   - Are elements positioned correctly?
   - Is the action button in the right place?
   - Is content scrollable as expected?

2. **Visual Consistency**:
   - Do all stages use the same layout pattern?
   - Is spacing and alignment consistent?
   - Are colors and styling uniform?

3. **RTL/LTR Support**:
   - Does the layout mirror correctly for RTL languages?
   - Are buttons and content in the right positions?

4. **Responsive Behavior**:
   - Do elements resize appropriately?
   - Is there overflow or layout breaking?

5. **Accessibility**:
   - Are interactive elements clearly visible?
   - Is there sufficient contrast?
   - Are buttons easily accessible?

## Reporting Behavior

**By default, only report on relevant screenshots** - those that show:

- Issues, regressions, or problems that need attention
- Significant changes from expected behavior
- Key features or states being tested in the current PR

**When to report on all screenshots:**

- Only when the user explicitly asks to "review all", "review all screenshots", or "show everything"

## Output Format

Provide a structured review:

```markdown
## 📊 E2E Screenshot Review - [Feature Name]

### ✅ Layout Verification

- **Screenshot X**: [Description of what you see]
- **Layout**: [Evaluation]

### 🎯 Key Observations

1. [Observation 1]
2. [Observation 2]

### ✨ Visual Quality

- [Assessment]

### 📸 Screenshot Highlights

- [Specific screenshots showing key features]

### Overall Assessment

[Summary and conclusion]
```

## Important Notes

- Always view multiple screenshots to get a complete picture
- Compare different test stages to verify consistency
- Report both successes and issues you find
- Be specific about which screenshot shows which feature
- Use screenshot filenames/paths for precise references

## Guidelines for QA Developers: Generating Screenshots in Tests

You are a front-end QA developer responsible for screenshots taken in tests. Make sure image content and name correlate with the screenshot's location and purpose in the test.

### Core Guidelines

**1. Place screenshot capture AFTER relevant wait for UI change**

- Don't capture mid-transition or during animations
- Wait for the UI state to stabilize before capturing
- Example: After clicking a button, wait for the page to fully render

**2. Unless specifically tested, wait for loading UI indication to end**

- Avoid capturing spinners, skeleton screens, or "Loading..." text unless that's what you're testing
- Wait for content to fully load
- Ensure all async data has been fetched and rendered

**3. For toasts, wait for the toast to appear**

- Toasts often have animation delays
- Wait for the toast to be fully visible and stable
- Consider the toast's display duration when timing screenshots

### Playwright Examples

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Wait for UI to stabilize
await page.click("#submit-button");
await page.waitForSelector(".success-message", { state: "visible" });
await page.screenshot({ path: "form-submitted-success.png" });

// ✅ Good: Wait for loading to complete
await page.goto("/dashboard");
await page.waitForSelector(".loading-spinner", { state: "hidden" });
await page.waitForSelector(".dashboard-content", { state: "visible" });
await page.screenshot({ path: "dashboard-loaded.png" });

// ✅ Good: Wait for toast animation
await page.click("#delete-item");
await page.waitForSelector(".toast", { state: "visible" });
await page.waitForTimeout(300); // Wait for animation
await page.screenshot({ path: "delete-success-toast.png" });
```

### Screenshot Naming Best Practices

- **Names must accurately describe ALL items tested before the screenshot**
- Use kebab-case for consistency
- Use descriptive names by default; only use shorthand if name exceeds 100 characters
- Examples:
  - `login-success-with-welcome-message.png` - captures login + welcome message
  - `card-hover-and-sizes.png` - captures both hover effect and size validation
  - `battle-participants-visible.png` - captures multiple participant elements
  - `form-validation-errors.png` - captures multiple validation states
  - `card-view.png` - shorthand acceptable if full name would exceed 100 chars

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Racing Conditions**: Don't rely on fixed timeouts; use proper wait conditions
2. **Inconsistent States**: Ensure screenshots always capture the same UI state
3. **Animation Interference**: Account for CSS animations and transitions
4. **Generic Names**: Avoid names like `screenshot-1.png` or `test.png`
5. **Loading Artifacts**: Don't capture temporary loading states unless intentional
