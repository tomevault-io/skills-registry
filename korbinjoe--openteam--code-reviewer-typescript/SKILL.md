## Positioning

Focused on **TypeScript language-level** type system and code structure review. Checks whether types are rigorous, designs are sound, and modules are clear.

Difference from `code-reviewer-react`: React skill focuses on component design and Hooks; this skill focuses on TS type gymnastics and module design.
Difference from `code-reviewer-nodejs`: Node.js skill focuses on runtime behavior; this skill focuses on compile-time type safety.

**Execution timing**: When reviewing `.ts` files (non-React components)
**Scan scope**: Specified files, or file list obtained via `git diff`

## Review Process

### Step 1: Determine Review Scope

Determine files to review by priority:

1. Files or directories explicitly specified by user
2. User mentions PR or branch → run `git diff --name-only <base>..HEAD` to get changed files
3. User says "look at recent changes" → run `git diff --name-only HEAD~1`
4. None of the above → ask user which files to review

Only review `.ts` files. Skip test files (`*.test.*` / `*.spec.*`), type declaration files (`*.d.ts`), and config files.
For `.tsx` files, use the `code-reviewer-react` skill instead.

### Step 2: Per-file Review

Read the complete file content first, understand context, then check each item. Execute the following review items for each file.

### Step 3: Summary Report

Generate a structured report using the output template at the bottom.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Type Safety

The type system is TypeScript's core value — loose types mean giving up compile-time protection.

**Check items**:
- Using `any` type → replace with specific type or `unknown`
- Using non-null assertion `!` → use optional chaining `?.` or type guards instead
- Using type assertion `as` to bypass checks → check if there's a safer type narrowing approach
- Whether `unknown` is properly narrowed after use (typeof / instanceof / custom type guards)
- Function parameters and return values have explicit types (exported functions must have explicit annotations)
- Whether implicit `any` exists (e.g., unannotated callback parameters, destructured assignments)

### 2. Generics Design

Generics are a powerful tool for code reuse, but overuse increases comprehension cost.

**Check items**:
- Whether generic parameters have reasonable constraints (`extends` restrictions)
- Whether unnecessary generics exist (a generic parameter used only once can be replaced with a concrete type)
- Whether conditional types are overly complex (more than 3 levels of nesting should be simplified or split)
- Whether generic parameter naming is semantic (`T` is fine, but `T, U, V, W` — four of them — need meaningful names)
- Whether utility types (Partial/Pick/Omit/Record) are used appropriately
- Whether runtime type information is needed but generics can't provide it (type erasure issue)

### 3. Interface & Type Design

Good type definitions are the foundation of code maintainability.

**Check items**:
- Whether `interface` vs `type` usage is appropriate (interface for object shapes and inheritance, type for union/intersection/mapped types)
- Whether discriminated unions are used for polymorphic scenarios
- Whether enums are reasonable → prefer `const enum` or string union types
- Whether optional properties `?` are truly optional (or just avoiding handling undefined)
- Whether interfaces are too large → consider splitting into smaller composable interfaces
- Whether type naming is semantic (avoid meaningless names like `IData`, `DataType`)

### 4. Module System

Clear module boundaries are the lifeline of large TypeScript projects.

**Check items**:
- Whether barrel exports (`index.ts` unified exports) are reasonable → avoid exporting internal implementation details
- Whether circular dependencies exist → check import chains
- Whether re-export depth is too deep (more than 2 levels of re-export increases tracing difficulty)
- Whether side-effect imports exist (`import './setup'`) → confirm necessity and add comments
- Whether path alias configuration matches actual directory structure
- Whether unused imports exist

### 5. Error Handling

TypeScript's type system can help build more robust error handling.

**Check items**:
- Whether async functions have try-catch or `.catch()` handling
- Whether Result pattern (`{ ok: true, data } | { ok: false, error }`) is used for predictable failures
- Whether custom error classes extend Error and have meaningful messages
- Whether Promise chains have complete error handling (no dangling Promises)
- Whether type guard functions (`is` assertions) correctly cover all cases
- Whether `never` type is used for exhaustiveness checking (switch default branch)

### 6. Code Standards & Readability

Readable TypeScript code makes types serve as documentation rather than burden.

**Check items**:
- Whether functions use early return to avoid deep nesting
- Whether variable/function naming is semantically clear
- Whether `const` assertions are used in appropriate places (`as const`)
- Whether `satisfies` operator is used where needed (type checking while preserving type inference)
- Whether magic numbers/strings are extracted as named constants
- Whether in-file code organization is logical (type definitions → constants → functions → exports)
- Whether complex types have comments explaining their purpose

### 7. Security

When external data enters a TypeScript system, compile-time types don't equal runtime safety.

**Check items**:
- Whether API response data has runtime validation (zod/io-ts/ajv etc.) rather than just `as` assertions
- Whether user input is validated and sanitized at system boundaries
- Whether sensitive data (tokens, passwords) has branded type marking to prevent misuse
- Whether `eval()` or `new Function()` is used → almost always a security risk
- Whether `JSON.parse` results are type-validated
- Whether external library type declarations (`@types/*`) versions match the library versions

## Review Output Format

```markdown
## Code Review Report — TypeScript

### Review Scope
- `path/to/file1.ts` (new / modified)
- `path/to/file2.ts` (modified)

### Review Summary
> One or two sentences summarizing overall code quality and main issues

### Issues Found

#### [P0] Must Fix (affects correctness or security)
1. **[Type safety]** `api.ts:47` — response data uses `as any` to bypass type checks,
   should use zod schema for runtime validation
2. **[Error handling]** `service.ts:23` — async function has no try-catch,
   Promise rejection becomes unhandled rejection

#### [P1] Suggested Improvements (affects maintainability or performance)
1. **[Generics design]** `utils.ts:12` — generic parameter `T` has no constraints,
   callers can pass any type, suggest adding `extends Record<string, unknown>`
2. **[Module]** `index.ts:5` — barrel export exposes internal implementation functions,
   should only export public API

#### [P2] Nice to Have (polish)
1. **[Naming]** `types.ts:8` — `IUserData` uses I prefix,
   TypeScript community convention doesn't use Hungarian notation

### Highlights
> List what's done well in the code (optional)
- Discriminated unions used properly, state branch handling is complete
- Custom type guards are cleanly encapsulated
