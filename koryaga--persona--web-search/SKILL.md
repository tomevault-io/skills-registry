# Web Search

## Quick Start

Search the web using the included script:

```bash
python3 /skills/web-search/scripts/web_search.py "your search query" [max_results]
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 /skills/web-search/scripts/web_search.py "latest AI research" 5
```

## Search Methods

### DuckDuckGo API (Default)
- **No setup required** - works out of the box
- Uses DuckDuckGo's Instant Answer API
- Returns structured results with titles and URLs
- Good for general searches and research

### Tavily API (Premium)
- **Setup required** - set `TRAVILY_TOKEN` environment variable
- Higher quality results with direct answers
- Better for complex queries and research
- Structured JSON response with content snippets

**To use Tavily:**
```bash
export TRAVILY_TOKEN="your-tavily-api-token"
python3 /skills/web-search/scripts/web_search.py "your query"
```

## Output Format

Both methods return JSON:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Result Title",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "content": "Optional content (Tavily only)"
  }
]
```

## Use Cases

- **Research**: Find current information on topics
- **URL Discovery**: Find relevant websites and resources
- **Fact Checking**: Verify information from multiple sources
- **Technical Documentation**: Find official docs and references
- **News & Updates**: Get current events and developments

## Integration with Scripts

The web search can be integrated into other scripts:

```python
import subprocess
import json

def search_and_extract(query, max_results=5):
    result = subprocess.run(
        ['python3', '/skills/web-search/scripts/web_search.py', query, str(max_results)],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    return json.loads(result.stdout)
```
