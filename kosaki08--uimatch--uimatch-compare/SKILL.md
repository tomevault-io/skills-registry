# uiMatch Visual Compare Skill

## Purpose

Run a **single visual comparison** between a Figma design node and an implementation URL  
(local app, Storybook iframe, or deployed page), then interpret the result.

Use this skill to:

- check how closely one component/page matches a Figma design
- get a Design Fidelity Score (DFS) and visual diff images
- enforce quality gates in local workflows before CI

---

## Environment / assumptions

- Run commands from the repository root.
- `@uimatch/cli` is installed as a devDependency.
- Playwright is installed and Chromium is available:
  - `npx playwright install chromium` has already been run.
- Node.js 20+ is available.

### Figma token (IMPORTANT)

The uiMatch CLI does **not** load `.env` files automatically.  
Before running any `uimatch compare` command, ensure:

```bash
export FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN="figd_..."
```

If the user mentions Figma API errors, check this first.

### Figma reference and shell quoting (IMPORTANT)

- Prefer `FILE_KEY:NODE_ID` format to avoid shell escaping issues:

  ```bash
  figma=AbCdEf123:1-2
  ```

- If you must use a full Figma URL, **always quote it**:

  ```bash
  figma='https://www.figma.com/file/AbCdEf123/MyDesign?type=design&node-id=1-2&mode=design'
  ```

Unquoted `?`, `&`, `=` may cause the shell to split the URL into multiple arguments and fail.

For more shared environment notes, see:

- `../_shared/uimatch-common-env.md`

For advanced tuning (viewport, dpr, size, contentBasis), see:

- `../_shared/uimatch-advanced-settings.md`

## How to run a comparison

### Recommended basic command

```bash
npx uimatch compare \
  figma=<FILE_KEY>:<NODE_ID> \
  story=<URL> \
  selector=<CSS_SELECTOR> \
  profile=component/dev \
  size=pad contentBasis=intersection \
  outDir=./uimatch-reports/<short-name>
```

Required parameters:

- `figma`: Figma file reference (`FILE_KEY:NODE_ID` or quoted full URL)
- `story`: implementation URL
  - Local app: `http://localhost:3000/your-page`
  - Storybook: `http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?id=button--primary`

- `selector`: CSS selector or data-testid for the element to capture

Recommended defaults:

- `profile=component/dev` – good balance for daily development
- `size=pad contentBasis=intersection` – handles page-vs-component cases well
- `outDir=./uimatch-reports/<short-name>` – per-comparison output folder

Examples:

```bash
# Storybook component vs Figma
npx uimatch compare \
  figma=AbCdEf123:1-2 \
  story=http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?id=button--primary \
  selector="#storybook-root button" \
  profile=component/dev \
  size=pad contentBasis=intersection \
  outDir=./uimatch-reports/button-primary
```

If layout depends on viewport or HiDPI, and you need to tweak them explicitly, add `viewport=` and/or `dpr=` as described in `../_shared/uimatch-advanced-settings.md`.

---

## Interpreting results

After `compare` finishes, open `<outDir>/report.json`.
Claude Code should:

1. Read `metrics.dfs` (Design Fidelity Score, 0–100).
2. Check `qualityGate.pass` (true/false).
3. If `pass` is false, inspect:
   - `qualityGate.reasons`
   - other metrics or style diffs if present.

Then:

- Summarize DFS and pass/fail status.
- Explain the main reasons in plain language (colors, spacing, layout, etc.).
- Suggest concrete changes (e.g. update CSS to match Figma, adjust padding, fix font size).

---

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when:

- The user is focusing on a **single component or page**.
- They want a detailed visual diff and numeric score.
- They are debugging one specific Figma node vs one URL.

If they want to run many comparisons at once, prefer the `uimatch-suite` skill.
If they only care about text/copy differences, prefer the `uimatch-text-diff` skill.
