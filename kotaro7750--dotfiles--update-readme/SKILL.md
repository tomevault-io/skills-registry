# Update README

## Goals

- Keep every README in the repo accurate for the current codebase.
- Ensure README explains the nix directory layout for common packages/settings and host-specific configuration placement.
- Remove outdated or no-longer-true statements.
- Write in concise English.

## Workflow

1) Discover README targets

- List README files with `rg --files -g 'README*'` from the repo root.
- Only the top-level `README.md` is permitted; subdirectory READMEs are not allowed.
- If any subdirectory README files exist, remove them and consolidate their content into the top-level README.

2) Determine scope for the README

- The top-level `README.md` must be the only README in the repo.
- Use the filesystem to confirm what exists before writing.

3) Rewrite the README

- Keep content minimal; include `## Setup` and `## Nix layout`.
- `## Setup`
  - Describe the exact setup steps required now.
  - Include copy-pasteable commands in Markdown code blocks so the setup can be executed directly.
  - Remove deprecated steps or tooling references.
- `## Nix layout`
  - Explain where common packages/settings live and where host-specific configuration lives inside `nix/`.
  - Use short sentences or bullets; avoid excessive detail.

4) Remove obsolete content

- Delete any badges, deprecated sections, or instructions that are no longer true.
- If a section cannot be substantiated from current files, remove it.

## Output expectations

- English only.
- No extra sections beyond the required two.
- For the root README, never mention deprecated folders (like `init/`) or non-active folders unless instructed.
- Only `README.md` at repo root may exist; delete any others.

## Notes

- This repo treats `git/`, `nvim/`, `wezterm/`, and `zsh/` as the active configuration roots.
- If a README claims to manage files or scripts that no longer exist, remove those claims.
