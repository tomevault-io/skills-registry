## Core Web Vitals Optimization Guide

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) - Target: Under 2.5 seconds

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Slow server response | CDN implementation, cache optimization, server upgrades |
| Render-blocking resources | Defer CSS/JS loading, inline Critical CSS |
| Slow image loading | Use WebP/AVIF, specify proper sizes, preload settings |
| Client-side rendering | Implement SSR/SSG, pre-render critical content |

**Example: Image Preloading**
```html
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="hero-image.webp" fetchpriority="high">
```

### INP (Interaction to Next Paint) - Target: Under 200ms

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Heavy JavaScript | Code splitting, remove unnecessary JS, defer execution |
| Long tasks | Split tasks (yield to main thread) |
| Large DOM size | Reduce DOM elements, implement virtual scrolling |
| Third-party scripts | Lazy load, review necessity |

**Example: Splitting Long Tasks**
```javascript
async function processLargeArray(items) {
  for (const item of items) {
    processItem(item);
    // Yield to main thread
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
  }
}
```

### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) - Target: Under 0.1

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Images/videos without dimensions | Specify width/height attributes, use aspect-ratio CSS |
| Dynamically inserted content | Reserve space in advance, use skeleton UI |
| Web fonts (FOUT/FOIT) | font-display: swap, preload fonts |
| Ads/embeds | Pre-position fixed-size containers |

**Example: Image Aspect Ratio**
```html
<img src="image.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Description"
     style="aspect-ratio: 4/3; width: 100%; height: auto;">
```

## Site Audit Workflow

### Phase 1: Crawl Diagnosis

```bash
# Check robots.txt
curl -s https://example.com/robots.txt

# Check sitemap
curl -s https://example.com/sitemap.xml | head -50

# Index status (site: search)
# Search "site:example.com" on Google
```

**Check Items:**
1. Are important pages blocked by robots.txt?
2. Does sitemap.xml exist and include main pages?
3. Does index count match expectations?

### Phase 2: Page-Level Diagnosis

**HTML Head Elements:**
```bash
# Extract meta information
curl -s https://example.com/ | grep -E '<title>|<meta name="description"|<link rel="canonical"'
```

**Check Items:**
1. Title tag (under 60 characters, includes keywords)
2. Meta description (under 160 characters)
3. Canonical URL
4. OGP / Twitter Card tags
5. Structured data presence

### Phase 3: Performance Diagnosis

**Lighthouse CLI:**
```bash
npx lighthouse https://example.com --output=json --output-path=./report.json
```

**Check Items:**
1. Core Web Vitals scores
2. Accessibility score
3. SEO score
4. Performance improvement suggestions

### Phase 4: Competitive Analysis

1. Content volume/structure of top-ranking sites
2. Backlink profiles
3. Structured data usage
4. Page speed comparison

### Phase 5: Improvement Priority Matrix

| Priority | Impact | Difficulty | Examples |
|----------|--------|------------|----------|
| Critical | High | Low | Remove noindex, fix 404s |
| High | High | Medium | Add structured data, optimize meta tags |
| Medium | Medium | Medium | Core Web Vitals improvements |
| Low | Low | High | Major site structure changes |
