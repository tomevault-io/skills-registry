# Julia GitHub Workflow

Use Git and the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for version control and pull request workflows
in Julia package development.

## Start Clean

- Keep `upstream` as source of truth and `origin` as your fork.
- Start from the current upstream default branch (`master` or `main`), not an
  old feature branch.
- Pull upstream first, then create a new branch from that tip.

```bash
git checkout master  # or main
git pull upstream master  # or main
git checkout -b descriptive-branch-name
```

## Basic Flow

```bash
git add file1.jl file2.jl
git commit -m "Add feature X that does Y"
git push -u origin descriptive-branch-name
```

## Creating Pull Requests

```bash
gh pr create \
    --title "Your PR Title" \
    --body "Description of changes" \
    --repo OriginalOrg/PackageName.jl
```
