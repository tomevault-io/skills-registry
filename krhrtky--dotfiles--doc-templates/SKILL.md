# Document Templates

Generate structured documents based on best practices and industry standards.

## Quick Start

Ask for a template by type:
- "Generate a meeting prep sheet"
- "Create an ADR for [decision]"
- "Generate a Design Doc for [feature]"

Templates are self-contained - no external files needed.

## Available Templates

**When to use**: Planning decision meetings, consultations, or information sharing sessions

**What it includes**:
- Meeting purpose classification
- Decision materials (background, problem, constraints)
- Options comparison table
