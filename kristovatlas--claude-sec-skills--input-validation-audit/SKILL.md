# Security Audit Skill

Perform comprehensive security audits of web applications with focus on input validation, sanitization, and encoding vulnerabilities.

## Audit Workflow

The security audit follows this bidirectional analysis approach:

1. **Codebase Discovery** - Map application structure and identify technologies
2. **Architecture Mapping** - Create visual diagrams of data flow and trust boundaries
3. **Input Enumeration** - Identify ALL potential untrusted data sources (broad interpretation)
4. **Sink Identification** - Find all security-sensitive operations
5. **Forward Flow Analysis** - Trace inputs → sinks for vulnerabilities
6. **Backward Flow Analysis** - Trace sinks → inputs for missed cases
7. **Sub-Agent Validation** - Validate findings with confidence scoring
8. **Report Generation** - Create audit-ready report with findings and remediation

## Input Classification (Broad Interpretation)

Treat the following as untrusted or semi-trusted inputs:

**Untrusted Inputs (Highest Risk):**
- User-supplied data: query parameters, POST data, cookies, headers
- File uploads: filename, content, metadata
- WebSocket/SSE messages
- Third-party API responses
- External service data (payment processors, analytics, etc.)
- Data from uncontrolled domains/origins

**Semi-Trusted Inputs (Compromise Risk):**
- Database content (could be compromised via SQLi or direct DB access)
- Cache/session storage (could be tampered)
- Configuration files from untrusted sources
- Environment variables in shared hosting
- Data from internal APIs outside current project scope
- Logs or audit trails (could contain injected content)

Unless documentation explicitly designates specific inputs as trusted, apply broad interpretation.

## Architecture Mapping and Diagrams

Create visual diagrams to illustrate the application's data flow and security boundaries. These diagrams help stakeholders understand the attack surface and data flow paths.

### Required Diagrams

**1. Data Flow Diagram**
Show how data moves through the application:
- External inputs (user browsers, APIs, third parties)
- Application components (frontend, backend, database, cache)
- Data transformations (validation, sanitization, encoding)
- Output destinations (rendered pages, API responses, logs)

Use Mermaid for creating diagrams:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Browser] -->|HTTP Request| B[Web Server]
    B -->|Query Params| C[Controller]
    C -->|Raw Input| D{Validation?}
    D -->|No| E[Database]
    E -->|Stored Data| F[Template Engine]
    F -->|Unescaped| G[HTML Response]
    G -->|XSS Risk| A
```

**2. Trust Boundary Diagram**
Identify trust boundaries and data crossing them:
- External trust boundary (internet → application)
- Internal boundaries (database → application code)
- Component boundaries (frontend ← backend API)
- Mark each boundary with validation/sanitization status

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Untrusted Zone"
        U[User Input]
        T[Third-Party API]
    end
    
    subgraph "Semi-Trusted Zone"
        DB[(Database)]
        Cache[(Redis Cache)]
    end
    
    subgraph "Application Zone"
        API[API Server]
        FE[Frontend]
    end
    
    U -.->|Needs Validation| API
    T -.->|Needs Validation| API
    DB -.->|Needs Encoding| FE
    API --> DB
```

**3. Attack Surface Map**
Visualize all entry points and potential attack vectors:
- List all inputs with their risk levels
- Show which sinks each input can reach
- Highlight unprotected paths

Create these diagrams and include them in the final report to help non-technical stakeholders understand the security posture.

## Critical Security Sinks

Identify these vulnerability classes and their sinks:

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
- Direct DOM manipulation: `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `document.write()`
- Template injection: unescaped template variables
- JavaScript execution: `eval()`, `Function()`, `setTimeout(string)`
- URL sinks: `href`, `src` attributes with user data
- Event handlers: `onclick`, `onerror`, etc. with dynamic content

**SQL Injection:**
- String concatenation in queries
- Unparameterized queries
- ORM raw queries without sanitization
- Dynamic table/column names from user input

**Command Injection:**
- `exec()`, `system()`, `shell_exec()`, `spawn()`
- Template command execution
- Unsafe subprocess calls

**Path Traversal:**
- File operations with user-controlled paths
- `include`, `require` with dynamic paths
- Archive extraction without validation

**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
- HTTP requests with user-controlled URLs
- DNS lookups with user input
- Internal API calls with dynamic endpoints

**Additional Sinks:**
- LDAP queries, XPath queries, XML parsing
- Deserialization of untrusted data
- File uploads without validation
- Redirect locations from user input

Consult `references/vulnerability-patterns.md` for detailed patterns.

## Bidirectional Analysis Approach

### Forward Analysis (Input → Sink)
For each identified input:
1. Trace data flow through the application
2. Track transformations (encoding, sanitization, validation)
3. Identify if data reaches security sinks without proper protection
4. Note validation/sanitization applied at each step

### Backward Analysis (Sink → Input)
For each identified sink:
1. Trace data origin backward
2. Identify all possible data sources
3. Check if ANY path lacks proper validation
4. Cross-reference with input enumeration to find missed inputs

**Both analyses must be performed** to achieve comprehensive coverage.

## Sub-Agent Validation Framework

For each potential finding, spawn a validation sub-agent to:

1. **Verify the vulnerability path exists**
2. **Assess exploitability**
3. **Check for framework protections** (auto-escaping, prepared statements, etc.)
4. **Assign confidence score** (0-100)

### Confidence Scoring Criteria

**High Confidence (80-100):**
- Clear direct path from untrusted input to dangerous sink
- No sanitization/encoding present
- No framework protection
- Easily exploitable

**Medium Confidence (50-79):**
- Path exists but includes some validation (insufficient/bypassable)
- Partial framework protection
- Requires specific conditions to exploit

**Low Confidence (20-49):**
- Indirect path or multiple assumptions required
- Strong validation present but potentially incomplete
- Framework provides partial protection

**False Positive (0-19):**
- Proper validation/encoding confirmed
- Framework fully protects against this vector
- Input cannot reach sink, or sink is not actually dangerous

**Confidence Threshold:** Report findings with confidence ≥ 50 as primary findings. List 20-49 scores separately as "low confidence / potential false positives".

Use `scripts/validate_finding.py` to systematically validate findings.

## Best Practices Recommendations

For each finding, recommend specific mitigations:

**General Principles:**
- Input validation: whitelist > blacklist
- Use framework-provided security features
- Apply defense in depth (validate at multiple layers)
- Encode/escape at output context, not input
- Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Context-Specific Encoding:**
- HTML context: HTML entity encoding
- JavaScript context: JavaScript escaping
- URL context: URL encoding
- SQL context: parameterized queries
- Command context: avoid shell execution, use safe APIs

Consult `references/secure-coding-practices.md` for framework-specific guidance.

## Output Format

- 20-49: Potential issue requiring manual investigation
- 0-19: Protected by existing controls

**Limitations:**
- Static analysis cannot detect all runtime vulnerabilities
- Some framework protections may not be fully recognized
- Complex data flows may require manual tracing
- Actual exploitability may vary based on deployment environment
