# Remembering Conversations

**Core principle:** Search before reinventing. Searching costs nothing; reinventing or repeating mistakes costs everything.

## Mandatory: Use the Search Agent

**YOU MUST dispatch the search-conversations agent for any historical search.**

Announce: "Dispatching search agent to find [topic]."

Then use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "search-conversations"`:

```
Task tool:
  description: "Search past conversations for [topic]"
  prompt: "Search for [specific query or topic]. Focus on [what you're looking for - e.g., decisions, patterns, gotchas, code examples]."
  subagent_type: "search-conversations"
```

The agent will:
1. Search with the `search` tool
2. Read top 2-5 results with the `show` tool
3. Synthesize findings (200-1000 words)
4. Return actionable insights + sources

**Saves 50-100x context vs. loading raw conversations.**

## When to Use

Search proactively:
- Before implementing features
- Before making architectural decisions
- When debugging (especially familiar-seeming issues)
- When partner mentions past work
- At the start of ANY non-trivial task

Don't search:
- For info in current conversation
- For current codebase structure (use Grep/Read)

## Direct Tool Access (Discouraged)

You CAN use MCP tools directly, but DON'T:
- `mcp__plugin_episodic-memory_episodic-memory__search`
- `mcp__plugin_episodic-memory_episodic-memory__show`

Using these directly wastes your context window. Always dispatch the agent instead.

See MCP-TOOLS.md for complete API reference if needed for advanced usage.
