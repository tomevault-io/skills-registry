# GCP Pub/Sub

Pub/Sub is a core building block for event-driven systems on Google Cloud, allowing loose coupling and horizontal scale. This skill helps the agent implement reliable publishing and consumption patterns with clear operational guardrails.

## How to model topics and subscriptions

1. Design topics around stable business events, not temporary implementation details.
2. Use separate subscriptions per consumer responsibility.
3. Choose pull vs push based on runtime and backpressure control needs.
4. Define naming conventions that encode domain and environment.

## How to publish messages safely

1. Include schema version and trace metadata in attributes.
2. Keep payloads compact and contract-oriented.
3. Enable batching for throughput-sensitive publishers.
4. Handle publish futures/errors and add retry with jitter for transient failures.

## How to consume with strong delivery guarantees

1. Acknowledge only after durable processing is complete.
2. Extend ack deadline for long-running handlers when required.
3. Make handlers idempotent to tolerate at-least-once delivery.
4. Define poison-message strategy with dead-letter topics.

## How to use ordering, retry, and exactly-once options

1. Use ordering keys only where strict sequence is business-critical.
2. Configure retry policy and max delivery attempts per subscription.
3. Use exactly-once delivery only when trade-offs are justified.
4. Keep failure handling observable and deterministic.

## How to tune throughput and flow control

1. Set flow-control limits by CPU/memory profile.
2. Tune max outstanding messages and bytes.
3. Scale consumers horizontally with partition-friendly processing.
4. Monitor publish latency, backlog, and redelivery trends.

## Common Warnings & Pitfalls

- Treating Pub/Sub as exactly-once by default.
- No schema evolution strategy for event contracts.
- Missing idempotency in consumers.
- Dead-letter policy configured but not monitored.
- Large message payloads causing processing and cost issues.

## Common Errors and Fixes

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Duplicate side effects in consumer | Non-idempotent handler with redelivery | Add idempotency key/state check before applying side effects |
| Growing backlog with stable traffic | Consumer throughput lower than publish rate | Scale workers, tune flow control, optimize handler time |
| Messages sent to DLQ unexpectedly | Retry policy too aggressive or permanent handler error | Adjust retries and fix deterministic handler failures |
| Ordering breaks under load | Missing/incorrect ordering key strategy | Apply stable ordering keys only where required |

## Advanced Tips

- Combine outbox pattern with Pub/Sub for transactional event publishing.
- Add contract tests for event schemas and compatibility checks in CI.
- Separate high-priority and bulk topics to isolate latency-sensitive flows.
- Build replay tools for controlled backfill and incident recovery.

## How to use extended references

- Read [Version History](references/version-history.md) before upgrades, migrations, or compatibility decisions.
- Read [Java and Kotlin Examples](references/java-kotlin-examples.md) for implementation-ready snippets and language-specific guidance.
- Read [Advanced Techniques](references/advanced-techniques.md) for specialist playbooks, incident tactics, and performance patterns.
