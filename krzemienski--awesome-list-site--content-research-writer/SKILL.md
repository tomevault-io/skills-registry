# Content Research Writer

Research topics and create compelling content for blogs, articles, and marketing materials.

## When NOT to Use

- Personal voice blog posts in a specific author's style (use `blog-post-writer` for Nick Nisi's voice)
- Pure technical documentation or API references (use `docs` or `technical-content-creator`)
- Conversion-focused landing page copy (use `copywriting` for persuasion formulas)
- Content that requires Story Circle narrative structure (use `blog-post-writer` or `conference-talk-builder`)

## Anti-Patterns

| NEVER | WHY | Fix |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Publish statistics without verifying sources | Outdated or fabricated stats destroy credibility; readers fact-check | Always note "Statistics should be verified" and cite specific sources with years |
| Use keyword density above 2% | Search engines penalize keyword stuffing; reads as spam to humans | Target 1-2% keyword density; use LSI/related terms naturally |
| Write generic introductions ("In today's fast-paced world...") | Readers bounce within 3 seconds if the hook is generic; wastes the most valuable real estate | Open with a specific data point, question, or scenario that creates tension |
| Skip the research brief and jump straight to writing | Content without research is shallow opinion; lacks data, quotes, and differentiation | Always complete the Topic Research Brief template before drafting |

## Conflicts

- **`blog-post-writer`**: Focuses on Nick Nisi's personal voice and Story Circle narrative. This skill is voice-agnostic and format-flexible.
- **`copywriting`**: Focuses on conversion and persuasion. This skill focuses on informational content and SEO.
- **`technical-content-creator`**: Creates publish-ready technical posts with diagrams. This skill covers broader content types (listicles, how-tos, marketing).

## Overview

This skill helps you:
- Research topics thoroughly
- Write engaging blog posts and articles
- Create SEO-optimized content
- Develop various content formats
- Maintain brand voice consistency

## Style Guidelines

### Tone Options

|------|-------------|---------|
| Professional | Formal, authoritative | "Research indicates that..." |
| Conversational | Friendly, relatable | "You know that feeling when..." |
| Educational | Clear, instructive | "Let's break this down..." |
| Persuasive | Compelling, action-oriented | "Imagine achieving..." |
| Playful | Fun, engaging | "Here's the plot twist..." |

### Best Practices
1. **Hook early**: First sentence should grab attention
2. **Be specific**: Data > vague claims
3. **Use examples**: Make abstract concrete
4. **Break it up**: Headers, bullets, images
5. **End strong**: Clear takeaway or CTA

## Cover Image Generation

After writing a blog post, generate a cover image using the `generate_cover` tool:

```
generate_cover(prompt="A detailed description of the image...", slug="your-blog-slug")
```

Save to `blogs/<slug>/hero.png`.

### Writing Effective Image Prompts

Structure your prompt with:
1. **Subject**: Main focus, specific and concrete
2. **Style**: Art direction (minimalist, isometric, flat design, 3D render, watercolor)
3. **Composition**: Element arrangement (centered, rule of thirds, symmetrical)
4. **Color palette**: Specific colors or mood (warm earth tones, cool blues and purples)
5. **Lighting/Atmosphere**: Soft diffused, dramatic shadows, golden hour, neon glow
6. **Technical details**: Aspect ratio, negative space for text overlay

### Example Prompts

**Technical post:**
```
Isometric 3D illustration of interconnected glowing cubes representing AI agents, each cube has subtle circuit patterns. Deep navy background (#0a192f) with electric blue (#64ffda) accents. Clean minimal style, lots of negative space at top for title.
```

**Tutorial/how-to:**
```
Clean flat illustration of hands typing on a keyboard with abstract code symbols floating upward, transforming into lightbulbs and gears. Warm gradient background from soft coral to light peach. Friendly, approachable style.
```

**Thought leadership:**
```
Abstract visualization of a human silhouette profile merging with geometric neural network patterns. Muted sage green and warm terracotta color scheme. Contemplative, forward-thinking mood.
```

### Blog Post Output Structure

Every blog post should produce both a post and a cover image:
```
blogs/<slug>/
├── post.md        # The blog post content
└── hero.png       # Generated cover image
```
