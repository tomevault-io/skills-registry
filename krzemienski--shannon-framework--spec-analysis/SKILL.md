# Specification Analysis

## Overview

**Purpose**: Shannon's signature 8-dimensional quantitative complexity analysis transforms unstructured specifications into actionable, quantitative project intelligence with objective scoring, domain detection, MCP recommendations, and 5-phase execution plans.

---

## Anti-Rationalization (From Baseline Testing)

**CRITICAL**: Agents systematically rationalize skipping or adjusting the spec-analysis algorithm. Below are the 4 most common rationalizations detected in baseline testing, with mandatory counters.

### Rationalization 1: "User's assessment seems reasonable"
**Example**: User says "I think this is 60/100 complexity" → Agent responds "Your assessment of 60/100 seems reasonable..."

**COUNTER**:
- ❌ **NEVER** accept user's subjective score without running the algorithm
- ✅ User intuition is a data point, not the answer
- ✅ ALWAYS calculate the 8D score objectively
- ✅ If user score differs from calculated score by >0.15, report both and explain why algorithm is more reliable

**Rule**: Apply algorithm. User intuition doesn't override calculation.

### Rationalization 2: "This spec is simple, skip analysis"
**Example**: User says "Just a simple CRUD app, no need for formal analysis" → Agent proceeds directly to implementation

**COUNTER**:
- ❌ **NEVER** skip analysis because spec "seems simple"
- ✅ Human intuition under-estimates complexity by 30-50%
- ✅ "Simple" specs often score 0.45-0.65 (Moderate-Complex) when analyzed objectively
- ✅ Analysis takes 30 seconds; rebuilding from missed complexity takes hours
- ✅ Even trivial specs get scored (minimum 0.10)

**Rule**: Even "simple" specs get analyzed. Takes 30 seconds. No exceptions.

### Rationalization 3: "Obviously frontend-heavy, skip domain counting"
**Example**: User says "It's a React app, so probably 80% frontend, 20% backend" → Agent accepts without validation

**COUNTER**:
- ❌ **NEVER** accept domain guesses without counting keywords
- ✅ "Obviously" is subjective; counting is objective
- ✅ Specs that "sound frontend" often have 40% backend when counted
- ✅ Use domain keyword algorithm: count all indicators, calculate percentages, normalize to 100%

**Rule**: Count indicators. Never guess domain percentages.

### Rationalization 4: "Score feels wrong, adjust it"
**Example**: Agent calculates 0.72, thinks "that seems too high", adjusts to 0.60

**COUNTER**:
- ❌ **NEVER** adjust calculated scores based on intuition
- ✅ If the score feels wrong, the algorithm is right
- ✅ "Feels high" often means you're underestimating hidden complexity
- ✅ Trust the math: 8 dimensions × weighted contribution = objective result
- ✅ Only recalculate if you find a calculation ERROR (wrong formula, wrong weights)

**Rule**: Algorithm is objective. If score feels wrong, algorithm is right.

### Detection Signal
**If you're tempted to**:
- Skip analysis for "simple" specs
- Accept user's score without calculating
- Guess domain percentages
- Adjust calculated scores

**Then you are rationalizing.** Stop. Run the algorithm. Report the results objectively.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User provides specification, requirements document, or project description (3+ paragraphs, 5+ features)
- Starting new project or feature requiring complexity assessment
- Planning resource allocation and timeline estimation
- Need objective, reproducible complexity metrics to guide execution strategy
- Determining whether to use wave-based execution (complexity >=0.50)

DO NOT use when:
- Casual conversation without specification
- User asking questions about existing code (use code analysis instead)
- Simple one-line requests ("change button color")

   - Apply qualifier multipliers ("entire" ×1.5, "all" ×1.3, "comprehensive" ×1.2)
   - Calculate: `structural_score = (file_factor × 0.40) + (service_factor × 0.30) + (module_factor × 0.20) + (component_factor × 0.10)`

2. **Cognitive Score**:
   - Count analysis verbs: ["analyze", "understand", "study"] (+0.20 per occurrence, max 0.40)

   - External dependencies: "third-party approval", "vendor" (+0.20 each, max 0.50)

9. **Weighted Total**:
   ```
   total = (0.20 × structural) + (0.15 × cognitive) + (0.15 × coordination) +
           (0.10 × temporal) + (0.15 × technical) + (0.10 × scale) +
           (0.10 × uncertainty) + (0.05 × dependencies)
   ```

**Output**:
- 8 individual dimension scores (0.0-1.0)
- Weighted total complexity score (0.0-1.0)
- Interpretation band (Simple/Moderate/Complex/High/Critical)
- Resource recommendations (agent count, wave count, timeline)

**Duration**: 1-2 minutes

### Step 3: Domain Identification
**Input**: Specification text (string)

**Processing**:
1. **Count Keywords per Domain**:
   - Frontend: ["React", "Vue", "component", "UI", "dashboard", "responsive", "CSS"] → count occurrences
   - Backend: ["API", "endpoint", "Express", "server", "microservice", "authentication"] → count
   - Database: ["PostgreSQL", "schema", "migration", "SQL", "ORM", "Prisma"] → count
   - Mobile: ["iOS", "Swift", "mobile app", "native", "Xcode"] → count
   - DevOps: ["Docker", "deployment", "CI/CD", "Kubernetes", "AWS"] → count
   - Security: ["authentication", "encryption", "OAuth", "HTTPS", "vulnerability"] → count

2. **Calculate Raw Percentages**:
   ```
   total_keywords = sum(all domain counts)
   frontend_percentage = (frontend_count / total_keywords) × 100
   backend_percentage = (backend_count / total_keywords) × 100
   ...
   ```

3. **Round and Normalize**:
   - Round each percentage to nearest integer
   - Calculate sum of rounded percentages
   - If sum ≠ 100%, distribute difference to largest domain(s)
   - **Verification**: Sum MUST equal 100%

4. **Generate Domain Descriptions**:
   - For each domain >0%, extract 2-3 characteristics from specification
   - Example: "Frontend (38%): React UI framework, dashboard components, responsive design"

**Output**:
- Domain percentages summing to 100%
- Domain characteristics (2-3 bullets per domain)
- Sorted by percentage (descending)

**Duration**: 30 seconds

### Step 4: MCP Server Recommendations
**Input**: Domain percentages, specification text

**Processing**:
1. **Tier 1 (MANDATORY)**:

3. **Tier 3 (SECONDARY)** - Supporting:
   - GitHub MCP (if not already suggested, for any project)
   - Stripe/PayPal MCP (if payment integration mentioned)

4. **Tier 4 (OPTIONAL)** - Keyword-triggered:
   - Tavily/Firecrawl MCP (if "research", "investigate" mentioned)
   - Monitoring MCPs (if "monitoring", "observability" mentioned)

5. **Generate Rationale**:
   - For each MCP: Purpose, usage patterns, when to use, fallback options, priority level
   - Include examples where applicable

**Output**:
- Tiered MCP list (Mandatory → Primary → Secondary → Optional)
- Each with: name, tier, priority, rationale, usage, alternatives
- Summary counts per tier

**Duration**: 1 minute

### Step 5: 5-Phase Plan Generation

**Output**:
- 5 phases with objectives, deliverables, validation gates, durations
- Domain-customized objectives per phase
- Testing requirements enforcing NO MOCKS philosophy
- Timeline breakdown (percentages and absolute times)

**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

### Step 6: Save to Serena MCP

---

## Agent Activation

**Agent**: SPEC_ANALYZER (optional, for complex specs)

**Context Provided**:
- System prompt: "You are Shannon's Specification Analyzer. Apply the 8-dimensional complexity framework systematically. Extract quantitative metrics, detect domains, recommend MCPs, generate 5-phase plans. Be objective and reproducible."
- Tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Sequential (if complex), Serena
- Domain knowledge: Complete SPEC_ANALYSIS.md algorithm, domain patterns, MCP matrix

**Activation Trigger**:
- Complexity preliminary estimate >=0.60 (requires deep analysis)
- Specification >2000 words (too large for single-pass analysis)
- User explicitly requests "/shannon:spec --deep"

**Behavior**:
- Uses Sequential MCP for 100-500 step systematic analysis
- Breaks down analysis into sub-problems per dimension
- Validates each dimension score independently
- Cross-checks domain percentages for consistency
- Generates detailed rationale for all recommendations

---

## MCP Integration

### Required MCPs

**Serena MCP** (MANDATORY)
- **Purpose**: Save complete analysis for cross-session context preservation, enable zero-loss restoration, share context across all waves and sub-agents
- **Usage**:
  ```javascript
  // Save analysis
  write_memory("spec_analysis_20250103_143022", {
    complexity_score: 0.68,
    domain_percentages: {...},
    mcp_recommendations: [...],
    phase_plan: [...]
  })

  // Retrieve later
  const analysis = read_memory("spec_analysis_20250103_143022")
  ```
- **Fallback**: Local file storage (degraded - no cross-session persistence)
- **Degradation**: MEDIUM (can continue with local storage, but lose cross-session context)
- **Verification**: Test with `list_memories()` - should return saved analyses

### Recommended MCPs

**Sequential MCP** (for complexity >=0.60)
- **Purpose**: Deep systematic thinking for complex specifications requiring 100-500 reasoning steps, hypothesis generation and testing, multi-faceted analysis
- **Trigger**: Preliminary complexity estimate >=0.60 (Complex-High or higher)
- **Usage**:
  ```javascript
  // Activate for deep analysis
  invoke_sequential({
    thought: "Analyzing structural complexity dimension...",
    thoughtNumber: 1,
    totalThoughts: 120,
    nextThoughtNeeded: true
  })
  ```
- **Fallback**: Native Claude reasoning (less structured, no hypothesis tracking)
- **Degradation**: LOW (native reasoning adequate for most specs)
- **When**: Complex specs with ambiguity, conflicting requirements, or high uncertainty scores

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Todo App (Score: 0.28-0.35)
**Input**:
```
Build a simple todo app with React. Users can:
- Add new tasks with title and description
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Filter by complete/incomplete

Store data in localStorage. Responsive design for mobile.
```

**Execution**:
```
Step 1: Detect activation → ✅ (5 feature items, explicit keywords "Build", "users can")
Step 2: 8D Scoring:
  - Structural: 1 file (React app) → 0.10
  - Cognitive: "design" mentioned → 0.20
  - Coordination: No teams → 0.10
  - Temporal: No deadline → 0.10
  - Technical: React (standard) → 0.20
  - Scale: localStorage (small) → 0.10
  - Uncertainty: Clear requirements → 0.10
  - Dependencies: None → 0.10
  - Weighted Total: 0.33

Step 3: Domain Detection:
  - Frontend: React(1), design(1), responsive(1), mobile(1) = 4 keywords
  - Backend: 0
  - Database: localStorage(1) = 1 keyword (counts as Database)
  - Total: 5 keywords
  - Frontend: 80%, Database: 20%

Step 4: MCP Recommendations:
  - Tier 1: Serena MCP (mandatory)
  - Tier 2: Magic MCP (Frontend 80%), Puppeteer MCP (Frontend testing)
  - Tier 3: GitHub MCP (version control)

Step 5: 5-Phase Plan:
  - Timeline: 4-6 hours (Simple)
  - Phase 1: 36 min (spec analysis)
  - Phase 2: 48 min (component design)
  - Phase 3: 2.4 hrs (implementation)
  - Phase 4: 36 min (Puppeteer tests)
  - Phase 5: 24 min (deployment)

Step 6: Save to Serena → spec_analysis_20250103_143022

Step 7: Output report generated

Step 8: Sub-skills: phase-planning invoked

Step 9: Validation: ✅ All checks passed, quality score: 1.0
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Specification Analysis ✅

**Recommended Waves**: 5-8 waves
**Timeline**: 20-25 days (EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE - HIGH RISK)
**Analysis ID**: spec_analysis_20250103_150015

⚠️  **WARNINGS**:
- Complexity 0.92 is in CRITICAL band (top 5% of all projects)
- 4-week deadline with 0.92 complexity = VERY HIGH RISK
- Uncertainty score 0.80 + Dependencies 0.75 = significant blockers
- Consider timeline extension or scope reduction

## Complexity Breakdown
| Dimension | Score | Weight | Contribution | RISK LEVEL |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------------|------------|
| Structural | 0.90 | 20% | 0.18 | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Cognitive | 0.85 | 15% | 0.13 | 🔴 HIGH |

| Dependencies | 0.75 | 5% | 0.04 | 🔴 HIGH |
| **TOTAL** | **0.92** | | **CRITICAL** |

## Domain Breakdown
- Backend (38%): Rust/C++ HFT engine, sub-millisecond latency, Kafka streaming, multi-exchange APIs
- Database (21%): TimescaleDB time-series (billions), Redis cluster order book, in-memory operations
- DevOps (17%): Distributed 5+ data centers, Kubernetes custom scheduling, 99.999% uptime
- Security (13%): SEC/FINRA compliance, regulatory reporting, security audit requirements
- ML (11%): LSTM price prediction, model architecture research, real-time inference

## Recommended MCPs (13 total)
### Tier 1: MANDATORY
1. **Serena MCP** - CRITICAL for context preservation across 5-8 waves

### Tier 2: PRIMARY (8 MCPs)
2. **Context7 MCP** - Rust/Kafka/TimescaleDB/Redis documentation
3. **Sequential MCP** - CRITICAL 200-500 step analysis for HFT architecture decisions
4. **PostgreSQL MCP** - TimescaleDB operations (time-series optimizations)

## 5-Phase Plan (20-25 days - CRITICAL TIMELINE)
[Phases with RISK MITIGATION strategies for each...]

## Risk Assessment
🔴 **CRITICAL RISKS**:
1. **Timeline Risk**: 0.92 complexity with 4-week deadline = 60% probability of delay
2. **Dependency Risk**: Blocked by vendor approvals (1 week) + security audit (2 weeks) = 3 weeks consumed before implementation
3. **Uncertainty Risk**: ML model unclear, disaster recovery undefined = potential architecture rework
4. **Technical Risk**: Sub-millisecond latency requirement with distributed system = extremely challenging
5. **Coordination Risk**: 5+ teams (Backend, ML, DevOps, Security, Legal) = high communication overhead

**RECOMMENDATION**:
- Extend deadline to 6-8 weeks (50% timeline buffer)
- Parallel-track vendor approvals NOW (don't wait)
- Dedicate 1-2 agents to ML research in Phase 1
- Use Sequential MCP for ALL critical architecture decisions
- Daily SITREP coordination meetings

## Next Steps
1. 🚨 **IMMEDIATE**: Escalate timeline risk to stakeholders
2. Configure ALL 13 recommended MCPs (no optional - all needed for CRITICAL)
3. Run /shannon:wave with --critical flag (expect 15-25 agents, 5-8 waves)
4. Use Sequential MCP for Phase 1 risk analysis (200-500 reasoning steps)
5. Establish SITREP daily coordination protocol
6. Begin vendor approval process IMMEDIATELY (parallel to analysis)
```

## Success Criteria

**Successful when**:
- ✅ Complexity score valid (0.0-1.0 range, not exactly 0.0 or 1.0)
- ✅ Domain percentages sum to exactly 100%
- ✅ Serena MCP included in Tier 1 (mandatory)
- ✅ At least 1 domain-specific MCP in Tier 2 (based on >=20% domain)
- ✅ 5-phase plan generated with validation gates for all phases
- ✅ Testing requirements enforce NO MOCKS philosophy (Puppeteer, real DBs)
- ✅ Analysis saved to Serena MCP with unique ID
- ✅ Execution strategy matches complexity (sequential <0.50, wave-based >=0.50)
- ✅ Timeline estimate aligns with complexity interpretation band
- ✅ Quality validation score >=0.80 (4/5 checks passed)

Validation:
```python
def validate_spec_analysis(result):
    assert 0.10 <= result["complexity_score"] <= 0.95
    assert sum(result["domain_percentages"].values()) == 100
    assert any(mcp["tier"] == 1 and mcp["name"] == "Serena MCP"
               for mcp in result["mcp_recommendations"])
    assert len(result["phase_plan"]) == 5
    assert all(phase.get("validation_gate") for phase in result["phase_plan"])
    assert result["analysis_id"].startswith("spec_analysis_")
```

**Fails if**:
- ❌ Complexity score is 0.0 or 1.0 (calculation error)
- ❌ Domain percentages sum to ≠100% (normalization failed)
- ❌ Serena MCP missing from recommendations (violates Shannon requirement)
- ❌ No domain-specific MCPs suggested (failed domain detection)
- ❌ <5 phases in plan (incomplete planning)
- ❌ Testing allows mocks or unit tests (violates NO MOCKS Iron Law)
- ❌ Analysis not saved to Serena (context loss risk)
- ❌ Execution strategy mismatches complexity (e.g., sequential for 0.70)
- ❌ Wave-based recommended for Simple/Moderate projects (over-engineering)

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Subjective "Simple" Bias
**Problem**: Developer looks at specification, thinks "this is simple," skips 8D analysis, estimates 2-3 hours

**Why It Fails**:
- Human intuition systematically under-estimates complexity by 30-50%
- "Simple" often scores 0.45-0.65 quantitatively (Moderate to Complex)
- Missing hidden complexity: auth, error handling, deployment, testing, docs
- Example: "Build a task manager" → Seems simple → Actually 0.55 (Complex) when scored

**Solution**: ALWAYS run spec-analysis, let quantitative scoring decide. 3-5 minutes investment prevents hours of rework.

**Prevention**: using-shannon skill makes spec-analysis mandatory first step

### Pitfall 2: Domain Detection Errors
**Problem**: Analysis shows "Frontend 100%, Backend 0%" for full-stack app → Frontend MCP overload, no Backend MCPs suggested

**Why It Fails**:
- Keyword counting biased toward verbose descriptions
- Example: "Build React app with Node.js backend" → "React" mentioned 8 times, "Node.js" once → 89% Frontend, 11% Backend
- Should be more balanced (40% Frontend, 40% Backend, 20% Database)

**Solution**: Normalize keyword counts by section, not raw occurrences. If spec mentions multiple domains explicitly, ensure each >=15%.

**Prevention**: Validation step checks for domain imbalance (warn if single domain >80%)

### Pitfall 3: MCP Recommendation Overkill
**Problem**: Suggests 15 MCPs for Simple (0.28) project → User overwhelmed, setup takes longer than implementation

**Why It Fails**:
- Tier thresholds too low (suggesting Primary MCPs for <20% domains)
- Including too many Optional MCPs
- Not considering setup overhead vs project duration

**Solution**:
- Strict tier thresholds: Tier 2 (PRIMARY) only for >=20% domains
- Limit Tier 4 (OPTIONAL) to 2-3 max
- For Simple/Moderate (<0.50), suggest 3-5 MCPs total
- For Complex (0.50-0.70), suggest 5-8 MCPs
- For High/Critical (>0.70), suggest 8-13 MCPs

**Prevention**: Validation checks MCP count vs complexity (warn if >10 MCPs for Simple project)

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Preliminary Estimate
**Problem**: Spec shows "URGENT", "ASAP", "critical deadline" → Temporal score calculated → Ignored when estimating timeline

**Why It Fails**:
- Timeline estimate based only on Structural/Technical dimensions
- Temporal dimension impacts resource allocation, not just timeline
- High Temporal (>0.60) should increase agent count, decrease per-agent timeline

**Solution**: High Temporal score → Recommend more parallel agents (2x normal), tighter wave coordination

**Prevention**: Timeline estimation formula includes Temporal as multiplier

### Pitfall 5: Phase Plan Generic (Not Domain-Customized)
**Problem**: Generated 5-phase plan identical for Frontend-heavy (Frontend 80%) vs Backend-heavy (Backend 70%) projects

**Why It Fails**:
- Phase objectives should reflect dominant domains
- Frontend-heavy needs UI design, component architecture in Phase 2
- Backend-heavy needs API design, database schema in Phase 2
- Generic plan misses domain-specific validation gates

**Solution**: Phase 2/3/4 objectives dynamically customized based on domain percentages >=40%

**Prevention**: Validation checks if Phase 2 includes domain-specific objectives (e.g., "component hierarchy" for Frontend >=40%)

### Pitfall 6: Testing Requirements Vague
**Problem**: Phase 4 says "Write tests" without specifying functional testing, NO MOCKS enforcement

**Why It Fails**:
- Developers default to unit tests with mocks (violates Shannon Iron Law)
- Vague testing requirements = inconsistent quality
- Shannon mandates: Puppeteer for Frontend, real HTTP for Backend, real DB for Database

**Solution**: Phase 4 testing requirements explicitly state:
- Frontend: "Puppeteer functional tests (real browser, NO MOCKS)"
- Backend: "API tests with real HTTP requests (NO MOCKS)"
- Database: "Database tests on test instance (real DB, NO MOCKS)"

**Prevention**: functional-testing skill enforces NO MOCKS, but spec-analysis should set expectations upfront

### Pitfall 7: Serena Save Fails Silently
**Problem**: Analysis completes, report generated, but Serena MCP write_memory() fails → No error shown → Context lost on next wave

**Why It Fails**:
- Network issues, Serena MCP disconnected, memory quota exceeded
- Analysis not re-saved
- Wave 2 starts without Wave 1 context

**Solution**: Verify Serena save with read-back test:
```javascript
write_memory(analysis_id, analysis_data)
const verify = read_memory(analysis_id)
if (!verify) throw Error("Serena save failed - analysis not persisted")
```

**Prevention**: Step 6 includes save verification, reports error if save fails

### Pitfall 8: Complexity Ceiling/Floor Violations
**Problem**: Specification is trivial (change button color) → Score calculated as 0.05 → Reported as 0.00

**Why It Fails**:
- Scores <0.10 rounded to 0.00 → Looks like calculation error
- Scores >0.95 capped at 1.00 → Loses granularity for "impossible" projects
- Users distrust perfect scores (0.00 or 1.00)

**Solution**:
- Minimum floor: 0.10 (even trivial tasks have some complexity)
- Maximum cap: 0.95 (leave room for "truly impossible")
- Report 0.10 as "Trivial (minimal complexity)" instead of 0.00

**Prevention**: Validation rejects scores <0.10 or >0.95 with warning

## Validation

**How to verify spec-analysis executed correctly**:

1. **Check Complexity Score**:
   - Score in range [0.10, 0.95] ✅
   - Not exactly 0.00 or 1.00 ✅
   - Matches expected interpretation band (e.g., 0.68 → "Complex-High") ✅

2. **Check Domain Percentages**:
   - Sum equals exactly 100% ✅
   - No single domain >95% (unless truly single-domain project) ✅
   - Dominant domains (>=20%) align with specification content ✅

3. **Check MCP Recommendations**:
   - Serena MCP in Tier 1 (mandatory) ✅
   - At least 1 domain-specific MCP in Tier 2 for dominant domain ✅
   - Total MCP count reasonable for complexity (<10 for Simple, <15 for Critical) ✅
   - Each MCP has rationale, usage, fallback ✅

4. **Check 5-Phase Plan**:
   - Exactly 5 phases present ✅
   - Each phase has objectives, deliverables, validation gate ✅
   - Phase 2/3 objectives customized for dominant domains ✅
   - Phase 4 testing requirements enforce NO MOCKS ✅
   - Timeline percentages sum to 100% (15% + 20% + 40% + 15% + 10%) ✅

5. **Check Serena Save**:
   - Analysis ID format: `spec_analysis_{timestamp}` ✅
   - Serena write_memory() successful ✅
   - Verify with read_memory(analysis_id) ✅

6. **Check Execution Strategy**:
   - Complexity <0.50 → Sequential execution ✅
   - Complexity >=0.50 → Wave-based execution ✅
   - High/Critical (>=0.70) → SITREP protocol recommended ✅

7. **Run Validation Script** (if available):
   ```bash
   python3 shannon-plugin/tests/validate_skills.py
   # Expected: ✅ spec-analysis: All validation checks passed
   ```

## Performance Benchmarks

**Expected Performance** (measured on Claude Sonnet 3.5):

| Specification Size | Analysis Time | Quality Score | Recommended Depth |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| <500 words | 30-60 seconds | 0.95+ | standard |
| 500-2000 words | 1-3 minutes | 0.90+ | standard |
| 2000-5000 words | 3-8 minutes | 0.85+ | deep (if complexity >=0.60) |
| >5000 words | 8-15 minutes | 0.80+ | deep (mandatory) |

**Performance Indicators**:
- ✅ **Fast**: <2 minutes for typical specs (<1000 words)
- ⚠️ **Acceptable**: 2-5 minutes for complex specs (1000-3000 words)
- 🔴 **Slow**: >8 minutes (check: is Sequential MCP needed? Is spec ambiguous requiring research?)

**Quality Validation**:
- Analysis quality score >=0.80 (4/5 validation checks passed)
- Domain percentages sum to exactly 100%
- Serena save verified with read-back test

**When Analysis Takes Longer**:
- Large specifications (>3000 words) → Expected, use --deep flag
- High uncertainty score (>0.60) → Research needed, acceptable delay
- Sequential MCP deep reasoning → 100-500 thoughts for complex specs, 5-15 minutes

  → Round to 0.32

Interpretation: 0.32 → MODERATE (0.30-0.50 band)
```

**Step 3: Domain Detection**
```
Count Keywords:
  Frontend: React(1), dashboard(1), filtering(1), view(1), real-time(1), updates(1) = 6
  Backend: Express(1), API(1), TypeScript(1), Authentication(1), REST(1), endpoints(1),
           CRUD(1), WebSocket(1), email(1), integration(1), SendGrid(1) = 11
  Database: PostgreSQL(1), Schema(1), tables(3), full-text(1), search(1) = 7
  DevOps: Docker(1), Deploy(1), AWS(1) = 3
  Total: 27 keywords

Calculate Percentages:
  Frontend: (6/27) × 100 = 22.2% → round to 22%
  Backend: (11/27) × 100 = 40.7% → round to 41%
  Database: (7/27) × 100 = 25.9% → round to 26%
  DevOps: (3/27) × 100 = 11.1% → round to 11%

Normalize (sum = 100%):
  22 + 41 + 26 + 11 = 100% ✅

Result:
  - Backend: 41%
  - Database: 26%
  - Frontend: 22%
  - DevOps: 11%
```

**Step 4: MCP Recommendations**
```
Tier 1 (MANDATORY):
  - Serena MCP → Always required

Tier 2 (PRIMARY) - Domain >=20%:
  - Backend 41% >=20% → Context7 MCP (Express/TypeScript docs)
  - Database 26% >=20% → PostgreSQL MCP
  - Frontend 22% >=20% → Magic MCP (component generation), Puppeteer MCP (testing)

Tier 3 (SECONDARY):
  - GitHub MCP (version control)
  - AWS MCP (deployment)
  - SendGrid MCP (email integration)

Tier 4 (OPTIONAL):
  - None (project well-defined, no research needed)

Result: 8 MCPs recommended
```

**Step 5: 5-Phase Plan**
```
Base Timeline: 1-2 days (MODERATE 0.32, user requested 1 week → achievable)

Phase 1 (15% = 2.4 hours):
  - Objectives: Complete spec analysis, task breakdown, risk assessment
  - Deliverables: Task list, complexity validated, MCP configuration
  - Validation Gate: All requirements understood, no ambiguities

Phase 2 (20% = 3.2 hours):
  - Objectives: System design, API design (Backend 41%), Database schema (Database 26%)
  - Deliverables: API spec, database schema, component hierarchy
  - Validation Gate: Design approved, patterns established

Phase 3 (40% = 6.4 hours):
  - Objectives: Backend API implementation (41%), Database setup (26%), Frontend components (22%)
  - Deliverables: REST endpoints, PostgreSQL schema, React dashboard
  - Validation Gate: Features complete, NO MOCKS tests passing

Phase 4 (15% = 2.4 hours):
  - Objectives: Integration testing (Puppeteer for Frontend, real HTTP for Backend, real DB)
  - Deliverables: Functional test suite (NO MOCKS), integration validated
  - Validation Gate: All tests passing (Puppeteer, API, Database)

Phase 5 (10% = 1.6 hours):
  - Objectives: Docker containerization, AWS deployment, documentation
  - Deliverables: Deployed system, technical docs
  - Validation Gate: System deployed, docs complete

Total: 16 hours ≈ 2 days (fits 1 week timeline comfortably)
```

**Step 6: Save to Serena MCP**
```javascript
const analysis_id = "spec_analysis_20251108_194500"
const analysis = {
  analysis_id: "spec_analysis_20251108_194500",
  complexity_score: 0.32,
  interpretation: "Moderate",
  dimension_scores: {
    structural: 0.27,
    cognitive: 0.15,
    coordination: 0.65,
    temporal: 0.30,
    technical: 0.50,
    scale: 0.15,
    uncertainty: 0.10,
    dependencies: 0.20
  },
  domain_percentages: {
    Backend: 41,
    Database: 26,
    Frontend: 22,
    DevOps: 11
  },
  mcp_recommendations: [...],
  phase_plan: [...],
  execution_strategy: "sequential",
  timeline_estimate: "1-2 days"
}

// Save
mcp__serena__write_memory(analysis_id, JSON.stringify(analysis))

// Verify
const verify = mcp__serena__read_memory(analysis_id)
if (!verify) throw Error("Serena save failed")
```

**Step 7: Format Output**
```markdown
# Specification Analysis ✅

**Complexity**: 0.32 / 1.0 (MODERATE)
**Execution Strategy**: Sequential (no waves needed)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days (16 hours)
**Analysis ID**: spec_analysis_20251108_194500
