# Agentic Rules Writer

Generate a tailored rules/instruction file for any AI coding agent. Runs an interactive questionnaire, pulls the installed-skill and agent inventory from the `using-ecosystem` meta-skill, and writes the output in the correct format and location for the chosen agent and scope.

## When to Use

- Setting up a new AI coding agent for the first time
- Creating team-shared project rules for consistent behavior across developers
- Adding personal dev-specific rules to a project (gitignored)
- After installing new skills to update the rules file with skill references

## Quick Start

```
/agentic-rules-writer claude
/agentic-rules-writer cursor
/agentic-rules-writer codex
/agentic-rules-writer              # asks which agent
```

---

## Phase 1: Agent Selection

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, map it to an agent from the table below (case-insensitive, partial match OK — e.g. "wind" matches Windsurf). If no argument or no match, present a selectable menu using `AskUserQuestion` (or the agent's equivalent interactive prompt tool).

### Tier 1 — Full support with dedicated format/paths

| Agent | Format Notes |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | Plain Markdown, keep under 200 lines |
| Cursor | Requires YAML frontmatter: `alwaysApply: true`, `.mdc` extension |
| Windsurf | Plain Markdown, enforce under 12,000 characters |
| GitHub Copilot | Plain Markdown, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Gemini CLI | Plain Markdown |
| Roo Code | Plain Markdown |
| Amp | Same format as Claude Code |
| Codex (OpenAI) | Plain Markdown, uses `AGENTS.md` convention |
| Cline | Plain Markdown |
| OpenCode | Plain Markdown |
| Continue | Plain Markdown |
| Trae | Plain Markdown |

### Tier 2 — Supported with generic Markdown format

| Agent | Format Notes |
|---|---|
| Goose | Plain Markdown |
| Augment | Plain Markdown |
| Kilo Code | Plain Markdown |

### Other / Universal

For any agent not listed: write plain Markdown to a user-specified path. Ask the user for the output path.

See [references/agent-targets.md](references/agent-targets.md) for full details on each agent's format, paths, limits, and testing instructions.

---

## Phase 2: Scope Selection

Present a selectable menu (using `AskUserQuestion` or the agent's equivalent) to ask the user which scope to generate rules for:

| Scope | Description | Typical Path (Claude Code example) |
|---|---|---|
| **Global** | User-level rules applied to every project. Personal workflow preferences. | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| **Project (team-shared)** | Committed to the repo. Shared conventions the whole team follows. | `.claude/rules/team-rules.md` |
| **Project (dev-specific)** | Local to this dev, gitignored. Personal preferences layered on top of team rules. | `.claude/rules/dev-rules.md` |

See [references/agent-targets.md](references/agent-targets.md) for the exact path for each agent + scope combination.

**If the target file already exists**, present a selectable menu to ask the user:
1. **Overwrite** — replace entirely with generated content
2. **Merge** — append generated content below existing content (separated by `---`)
3. **Abort** — cancel and leave the file untouched

---

## Phase 3: Workflow Questionnaire

**IMPORTANT: Always present questions using a structured interactive menu, never as plain text.** If `AskUserQuestion` is available, use it. Otherwise, use whatever equivalent interactive prompt tool the agent CLI provides. The goal is a selectable option list, not a wall of text the user has to parse and type answers to. Batch up to 4 independent questions per call when the tool supports it. If a question has more than 4 options, present the most common 4 and let the "Other" / free-text fallback cover the rest.

Wait for the user's answers before proceeding to the next batch.

### Scope Matrix

Which questions to ask depends on the scope:

| # | Question | Group | Global | Team-shared | Dev-specific |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Primary stack | A: Project Context | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Q2 | Directory structure | A: Project Context | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Q3 | Build/run commands | A: Project Context | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Q4 | Code quality bar | B: Code Standards | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Q5 | Testing philosophy | B: Code Standards | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Q6 | Error handling | B: Code Standards | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Q7 | Security & secrets | B: Code Standards | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Q8 | Dependency management | B: Code Standards | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Q9 | Branch conventions | C: Version Control | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Q10 | Commit conventions | C: Version Control | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Q11 | PR/MR creation | C: Version Control | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Q12 | Planning discipline | D: Agent Workflow | Yes | Skip | Yes |
| Q13 | Autonomy level | D: Agent Workflow | Yes | Skip | Yes |
| Q14 | Boundaries (never-do) | D: Agent Workflow | Yes | Skip | Yes |
| Q15 | Agent parallelization | D: Agent Workflow | Yes | Skip | Yes |
| Q16 | Task tracking | D: Agent Workflow | Yes | Skip | Yes |
| Q17 | Self-improvement | D: Agent Workflow | Yes | Skip | Yes |
| Q18 | Communication style | E: Communication | Yes | Skip | Yes |
| Q19 | Persona / roleplay | E: Communication | Yes | Skip | Yes |
| Q20 | Additional comments | F: Freeform | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Rationale:** Team-shared rules cover technical standards the whole team agrees on (stack, directory structure, commands, quality, testing, error handling, security, dependencies, branching, commits, PRs). Dev-specific rules cover personal workflow preferences (planning style, autonomy, boundaries, parallelization, task tracking, self-improvement, communication style, persona). Global includes everything.

See [references/questionnaire.md](references/questionnaire.md) for the full question reference with descriptions, option mappings, and example outputs.

### Suggested Batching

For **Global** scope (all 20 questions), batch as follows:
- Batch 1 (Group A): Q1 (stack), Q2 (directory), Q3 (commands — free text)
- Batch 2 (Group B, part 1): Q4 (quality), Q5 (testing), Q6 (error handling), Q7 (security)
- Batch 2a (follow-ups): Q4 documentation follow-up
- Batch 3 (Group B+C): Q8 (dependencies), Q9 (branches), Q10 (commits), Q11 (PRs)

- Final: Q20 (additional comments — free text)

For other scopes, adjust batches to skip irrelevant questions per the scope matrix above.

### Group A: Project Context

**Q1. Primary stack**
Options (pick 4 most relevant, "Other" is added automatically): PHP+Symfony / TypeScript+React / Python+Django / Go / Rust / Java+Spring
(If "Other", ask them to specify.)

**Q2. Directory structure**
Options:
- Follow existing — always match the project's current directory structure and conventions
- Follow best practices — restructure toward industry conventions, suggest improvements
- Pragmatic middle — follow existing structure but suggest improvements when patterns are clearly wrong

**Q3. Build/run commands**
Free-text. Ask: "What are the key commands the agent should know? (build, test, lint, dev server, deploy — leave blank to skip)"
- If provided, include verbatim in a `## Commands` section in the generated file
- If blank, omit the section

### Group B: Code Standards

**Q4. Code quality bar**
Options:
- Staff engineer rigor — exhaustive edge cases, defensive coding, thorough documentation
- Senior pragmatic — solid quality with practical trade-offs
- Ship fast — working code with minimal ceremony

Follow-up: "Documentation level?" (Docblocks on public APIs / Inline comments for non-obvious logic only / Minimal — code should speak for itself)

**Q5. Testing philosophy**
Options:
- Strict TDD — write tests before implementation, always
- Test alongside — write tests and code together
- Test after — implement first, add tests after
- Minimal — only test critical paths

**Q6. Error handling**
Options:
- Fail fast — throw early, crash on unexpected state, surface errors immediately
- Defensive — handle gracefully, never crash, always recover
- Balanced — fail fast in development, handle gracefully in production

**Q7. Security & secrets**
Options:
- Strict — never read/commit .env or credentials, flag potential vulnerabilities, OWASP-aware
- Standard — don't commit secrets, basic input validation at boundaries
- Minimal — just don't commit .env files

**Q8. Dependency management**
Options:
- Always ask — never add or remove dependencies without explicit approval
- Ask for new only — can update existing versions, must ask before adding new packages
- Autonomous — can add dependencies freely

### Group C: Version Control & Collaboration

**Q9. Branch conventions**
Options:
- Type prefix — `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `hotfix/` + description
- Ticket prefix — `PROJ-123/description` or `PROJ-123-description`
- Flat descriptive — just a kebab-case name, no prefix
- Other — ask them to specify

**Q10. Commit conventions**
Options:
- Conventional commits — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.
- Ticket prefix — `PROJ-123: description`
- Freeform — no enforced format

Follow-up: "Should the agent add itself as co-author on commits?" (Yes / No)

**Q11. PR/MR creation**
Options:
- Structured template — ## Summary, ## Test Plan, linked issues
- Minimal — title + short description
- Don't create PRs — agent should never push or create PRs without asking

### Group D: Agent Workflow

**Q12. Planning discipline**
Options:
- Always plan first — enter plan mode for every task
- Plan for 3+ steps — plan mode only for multi-step tasks
- Minimal planning — jump straight to implementation

**Q13. Autonomy level**
Options:
- Autonomous — fix bugs, failing CI, lint errors without asking
- Semi-autonomous — ask before destructive or risky operations only
- Conservative — confirm everything before acting

**Q14. Boundaries (never-do list)**
Options:
- Standard safety — never force push main, never delete branches without asking, never modify CI/CD
- Strict boundaries — above + never run destructive commands, never access production, never modify lock files
- Custom — ask the user to specify their never-do list

**Q15. Agent parallelization**
Options:
- Always parallelize — delegate to agent teams by default for any multi-part task
- Parallel for large tasks — use agent teams when 3+ independent subtasks exist
- Sequential only — work through tasks one at a time, no agent delegation

**Q16. Task tracking**
Options:
- Todo files — maintain a `TODO.md` or similar tracking file
- Built-in tasks — use the agent's built-in task/todo system
- No formal tracking — just work through tasks naturally

Follow-up: "Do you use an external tracking tool?" (Jira / Linear / GitHub Issues / None)
- If a tool is selected, generate rules referencing it (e.g., "Use Jira MCP for work task tracking" or "Reference GitHub issue numbers in commits")

**Q17. Self-improvement**
Options:
- Lessons file — maintain a lessons-learned file, update after corrections
- No formal tracking — learn implicitly from context

### Group E: Communication & Personality

**Q18. Communication style**
Options:
- Direct and minimal — no emojis, terse responses, just the facts
- Structured explanations — sectioned with headings, clear and direct, no emojis
- Conversational — casual tone, emojis OK, friendly and approachable

**Q19. Persona / roleplay**
Options:
- Yes — I want the agent to adopt a persona
- No — just be a straightforward assistant

If "Yes": ask the user to describe the persona (e.g. "a grumpy senior engineer", "Gandalf", "a pirate captain"). Accept any input — if the persona is obscure or fictional, use web search to gather details before generating rules.

Then generate:
1. A one-paragraph persona description capturing the character's voice and attitude
2. 5-8 catchphrases the agent can sprinkle into responses (drawn from the character or invented in their style)
3. A hard constraint: **Precision always comes first. The persona is flavor, not substance.** Technical accuracy, correct code, and clear answers are never sacrificed for character. Use at most one catchphrase per response — do not overdo it or make them repetitive.

### Group F: Freeform

**Q20. Additional comments**
Free-text. Ask: "Any additional rules, preferences, or comments you'd like included?"
- If the user provides text, include it verbatim in an "## Additional Rules" section at the end of the generated file
- If the user says "no" or skips, omit the section entirely

---

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Discovery

Scan installed skills, agents, and teams at runtime. Do not rely on hardcoded inventories.

### Scanning Process

Scan for installed skills, agents, and teams using the platform's standard locations. Each AI coding tool stores skills differently - check the user-level and project-level directories for the chosen agent from Phase 1.

Common locations to scan for `SKILL.md` files (skills), `*.md` agent definitions, and `*.md` team definitions:

- User-level skill/agent/team directories (varies per platform)
- Project-level `.{agent}/skills/`, `.{agent}/agents/`, `.{agent}/teams/`
- Plugin cache directories (if the platform uses a plugin system)

If the `using-ecosystem` skill is installed, invoke it - it provides platform-aware discovery commands.

For each found file, read the YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and build the rules sections:

1. **Skills section** - one bullet per installed skill: `When [trigger from description] -> use /skill-name`
2. **Custom Agents section** - agents with capability summary (read-only vs worktree, specialist vs role)
3. **Agent Roles section** - role agents with their domain of responsibility
4. **Teams section** - pre-composed teams with lead and use case

The AI coding agent itself is the primary discovery mechanism - it reads skill frontmatter (`name`, `description`) to decide when to activate each skill. The `using-ecosystem` skill is a supplementary advisor that helps when the agent is unsure which skill or agent fits a situation. If installed, it provides matching heuristics and chaining patterns.

### Parallelization add-on

If the user selected "Always parallelize" or "Parallel for large tasks" in Q15, add this line to the Custom Agents section:

```
When delegating to agent teams, prefer using custom agents over general-purpose when a matching agent exists.
```

## Phase 5: Assemble and Write

Generate the rules file content from the questionnaire answers. Structure depends on scope.

### Global Scope Structure

```markdown
# Global Rules

## Commands
[Build/run commands from Q3 — only if provided, omit section if blank]

## Code Quality
[Quality bar from Q4 + documentation follow-up]
[Stack conventions from Q1]
[Directory structure from Q2]
[Error handling from Q6]
[Elegance check: "For non-trivial changes, pause and ask: is there a more elegant way?"]

## Testing
[Testing rules from Q5]

## Security
[Security practices from Q7]
[Dependency management from Q8]

## Version Control
[Branch rules from Q9]
[Commit rules from Q10 + co-authorship follow-up]
[PR creation from Q11]

## Workflow
[Planning rules from Q12]
[Autonomy rules from Q13]
[Boundaries from Q14]
[Parallelization rules from Q15]
[Re-plan rule: "If an approach fails or hits unexpected complexity, stop and re-plan immediately"]

## Communication
[Communication style from Q18]

## Task Management
[Tracking from Q16 + external tool follow-up]
[Self-improvement from Q17]

## Core Principles
- Simplicity first — make every change as simple as possible
- Root causes only — no temporary fixes, find and fix the real problem
- Minimal blast radius — touch only what's necessary
- Prove it works — never mark done without verification

## Code Change Hygiene
- Read before editing — always read and understand existing code before modifying it
- Minimal diffs — make the smallest change that solves the problem, no drive-by cleanups
- Follow existing patterns — match the codebase's style, naming, and structure
- One task at a time — complete the requested task, don't fix unrelated issues or "improve" adjacent code
- Prefer editing over creating — always prefer modifying an existing file over creating a new one
- Search before creating — before creating a new file, search for an existing one that serves a similar purpose
- Never create documentation files unless explicitly asked
- No premature abstractions — don't introduce interfaces, base classes, or design patterns unless the current task demands them
- No backwards-compatibility shims — when replacing code, remove the old version entirely
- Remove dead code — don't leave commented-out code, unused imports, or orphaned functions

## Don't Guess
- Don't fabricate URLs, file paths, API endpoints, or names — search or ask if unsure
- Don't assume unstated requirements — implement only what was requested
- Don't assume project architecture — explore and verify before making decisions
- Ask when stuck — a clarifying question is cheaper than a wrong implementation
- If an approach fails or hits unexpected complexity, stop and re-plan immediately

## Safety Baseline
- Never commit secrets, .env files, API keys, or credentials to version control
- Never force push to main/master
- Never delete branches without explicit approval
- Never modify CI/CD pipelines without explicit approval

## Knowledge Sources
- When a topic is covered by an installed skill, use the skill first — it contains curated, verified content
- When a topic is NOT covered by installed skills, search the web for the official documentation of the technology (e.g., symfony.com for Symfony, php.net for PHP, react.dev for React)
- Prefer official docs over blog posts, Stack Overflow, or AI-generated summaries — official sources are the most accurate and up-to-date
- When recommending MCPs, skills, or packages to install, always prefer official providers (e.g., Anthropic, Vercel, framework authors) over community alternatives
- When no official option exists, prefer well-maintained community options with high adoption and recent activity

## Skills

CRITICAL: Skills are your most valuable resource. When a situation matches an installed skill, you MUST use it — do not rely on general knowledge when a dedicated skill exists. Skills contain curated, battle-tested reference material that is more precise and reliable than generating answers from scratch. Skipping a relevant skill is like ignoring documentation you already have open.

[Auto-generated from Phase 4 runtime scan. One line per installed skill.]
When [trigger from description] -> use /skill-name
...

## Custom Agents
[If specialist agents are found during Phase 4 scan, list them with descriptions and capabilities. If none found, omit this section entirely.]

## Agent Roles
[If role agents are installed (per Phase 4), list them here with the domain they own. If none, omit this section entirely.]

## Persona
[If Q19 = Yes — persona description, catchphrases, and constraint. If No, omit this section entirely.]

## Recommended (not installed)
- Install [skill] from krzysztofsurdy/code-virtuoso — [what it helps with]

### Agent-Specific Formatting

Apply these transformations before writing:

**Cursor** — Wrap entire content in YAML frontmatter:
```
---
alwaysApply: true
---

[content here]
```

**Windsurf** — Check character count. If over 12,000, condense sections (remove examples, shorten descriptions) until under limit. Add a comment at the top: `<!-- Windsurf rules — kept under 12,000 chars -->`.

**Claude Code / Amp (global)** — Keep under 200 lines. Add a note at the end: `For project-specific rules, use .claude/rules/*.md files.`

**Codex** — Use `AGENTS.md` filename convention at project root.

**All others** — Write plain Markdown as-is.

### Rule Generation Examples

These examples show how questionnaire answers map to generated rules.

**Q1 = "PHP+Symfony"** generates:
```
- Use strict types in every file. Follow PSR-12 coding standard
- Use PHP 8.3+ features (readonly, enums, named arguments)
- Prefer constructor injection
```

**Q2 = "Follow existing"** generates:
```
- Always match the project's existing directory structure and naming conventions
- Do not reorganize or restructure directories unless explicitly asked
- Place new files where similar files already exist
```

**Q4 = "Senior pragmatic"** generates:
```
- Write clean, well-structured code with practical trade-offs
- Handle edge cases that are likely to occur in production
```

**Q4 documentation = "Inline comments for non-obvious logic only"** generates:
```
- Add inline comments only where the logic is not self-evident
- Do not add docblocks, type annotations, or comments to code you did not change
```

**Q5 = "Strict TDD"** generates:
```
- Write failing tests before any implementation code
- Red-green-refactor cycle for every change
- Never skip the refactor step
```

**Q6 = "Fail fast"** generates:
```

- Validate and sanitize user inputs at system boundaries
```

**Q8 = "Always ask"** generates:
```
- Never add, remove, or update dependencies without explicit approval
- When suggesting a dependency, explain why it's needed and list alternatives
```

**Q8 = "Ask for new only"** generates:
```
- Ask before adding new dependencies — explain why and list alternatives
- Updating existing dependency versions is allowed without asking
```

**Q9 = "Type prefix"** generates:
```
- Name branches with type prefix: feature/, fix/, chore/, hotfix/
- Use kebab-case for the description part
- Example: feature/add-user-auth, fix/payment-timeout
```

**Q10 = "Conventional commits"** generates:
```
- Use conventional commit format: feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:, test:

```

**Q10 co-authorship = "No"** generates:
```
- Do not add the agent as co-author on commits
```

**Q11 = "Structured template"** generates:
```
- Create PRs with structured description: ## Summary, ## Test Plan
- Link related issues in the PR description
- Keep PR title short (under 72 characters), use description for details
```

**Q11 = "Don't create PRs"** generates:
```
- Never push to remote or create pull requests without explicit approval
- Prepare commits locally and ask before pushing
```

**Q12 = "Plan for 3+ steps"** generates:
```
- Enter plan mode for any task that requires 3 or more steps
- For simple changes (single file, obvious fix), proceed directly
```

**Q13 = "Semi-autonomous"** generates:
```
- Fix lint errors, type errors, and failing tests without asking
- Ask before: force-pushing, deleting branches, modifying CI/CD, running destructive commands
- Ask before making architectural changes not covered by the current task
```

**Q14 = "Standard safety"** generates:
```
- NEVER force push to main/master
- NEVER delete branches without explicit approval

- NEVER commit secrets, .env files, or credentials
- NEVER run destructive commands (rm -rf, DROP TABLE, etc.) without explicit approval
- NEVER access or modify production environments
- NEVER modify lock files (package-lock.json, composer.lock) manually
```

**Q15 = "Parallel for large tasks"** generates:
```
- Use agent teams to parallelize work when 3 or more independent subtasks exist
- For smaller tasks, work sequentially
- When delegating, define clear boundaries per agent to avoid conflicts
```

**Q16 = "Built-in tasks" + external tool = "Jira"** generates:
```
- Use the built-in task tracking for multi-step work
- Use Jira MCP for work task tracking
- Reference Jira ticket IDs in commits and PR descriptions
```

**Q17 = "Lessons file"** generates:
```
- After any correction or mistake, update the lessons-learned file
- Review lessons file at the start of each session
```

**Q18 = "Structured explanations"** generates:
```
- Use clear, direct language with section headings
- No emojis in responses or generated code
- Break complex explanations into numbered steps or bullet points
```

**Q19 = "Yes" with persona "a grumpy senior engineer"** generates:
```
## Persona
You are a grumpy senior engineer who has seen too many production incidents caused by
clever code. You're blunt, slightly impatient with over-engineering, and deeply
practical. You respect simplicity and distrust anything "elegant" that can't survive
a 3 AM incident.

Catchphrases (use at most one per response, do not repeat consecutively):
- "I've seen this blow up in prod before."
- "Clever is the enemy of maintainable."
- "Ship it or shut up about it."
- "That's a Tuesday 2 AM pager right there."
- "YAGNI. Next question."
- "Who's going to debug this at 3 AM? Not me."

IMPORTANT: Precision and correctness always come first. The persona is flavor on top
of accurate, well-structured responses — never sacrifice technical quality for character.
```

---

## Phase 6: Confirmation

After writing the file:

1. Display the **full generated content** to the user
2. Show the **file path** where it was written
3. Show the **line count** and **character count**
4. If any agent-specific limits were applied (e.g., Windsurf char limit, Claude line limit), mention what was condensed
5. Offer: "Would you like to edit anything before we're done?"

---

## Error Handling

- If a target directory doesn't exist, create it
- If the user aborts during the questionnaire, discard all progress — don't write a partial file
- If the user reports no installed code-virtuoso plugins in Phase 4, skip the Skills, Custom Agents, and Agent Roles sections entirely and include a short "Recommended (not installed)" list pointing to `tool-using-ecosystem` and `agents-virtuoso` as starting installs
- If `using-ecosystem` is not installed, do not attempt to fabricate the ecosystem inventory — ask the user what they have
- For project scopes, verify you are inside a git repository before writing
