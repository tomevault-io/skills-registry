description: SOLID principles for object-oriented design with multi-language examples (PHP, Java, Python, TypeScript, C++). Use when the user asks to review SOLID compliance, fix a SOLID violation, evaluate class design, reduce coupling, improve extensibility, or apply Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, or Dependency Inversion principles. Covers motivation, violation detection, refactoring fixes, and real-world trade-offs for each principle. Use when this capability is needed.

# SOLID Principles

Five core principles of object-oriented design that lead to systems which are simpler to maintain, test, and extend. Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) formalized these ideas, and Michael Feathers coined the SOLID acronym.

## Principle Index

| Principle | Summary | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **S** — Single Responsibility | A class should have only one reason to change | [reference](references/srp.md) |
| **O** — Open/Closed | Open for extension, closed for modification | [reference](references/ocp.md) |
| **L** — Liskov Substitution | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types | [reference](references/lsp.md) |
| **I** — Interface Segregation | Prefer many specific interfaces over one general-purpose interface | [reference](references/isp.md) |
| **D** — Dependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions, not concretions | [reference](references/dip.md) |

## Why SOLID Matters

Without SOLID, codebases gradually develop these problems:

- **Rigidity** — one change ripples through many unrelated modules
- **Fragility** — modifying one area breaks another seemingly unconnected area
- **Immobility** — components are so intertwined that extracting them for reuse is impractical
- **Viscosity** — doing things correctly is harder than hacking around the design

SOLID tackles each of these by defining clear boundaries, explicit contracts, and flexible points for extension.

## Quick Decision Guide

| Symptom | Likely Violated Principle | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Class does too many things | **SRP** | Split into focused classes |
| Adding a feature requires editing existing classes | **OCP** | Introduce polymorphism or strategy |
| Subclass breaks when used in place of parent | **LSP** | Fix inheritance hierarchy or use composition |
| Classes forced to implement unused methods | **ISP** | Break interface into smaller ones |
| High-level module imports low-level details | **DIP** | Introduce an abstraction layer |

## Quick Examples

### SRP — Before and After

```php
// BEFORE: Class handles both user data AND email sending
class UserService {
    public function createUser(string $name, string $email): void { /* ... */ }
    public function sendWelcomeEmail(string $email): void { /* ... */ }
}

// AFTER: Each class has one responsibility
class UserService {
    public function __construct(private UserNotifier $notifier) {}
    public function createUser(string $name, string $email): void {
        // persist user...
        $this->notifier->welcomeNewUser($email);
    }
}

class UserNotifier {
    public function welcomeNewUser(string $email): void { /* ... */ }
}
```

### OCP — Extend Without Modifying

```php
interface DiscountPolicy {
    public function calculate(float $total): float;
}

class PercentageDiscount implements DiscountPolicy {
    public function __construct(private float $rate) {}
    public function calculate(float $total): float {
        return $total * $this->rate;
    }
}

// Adding a new discount type requires NO changes to existing code
class FlatDiscount implements DiscountPolicy {
    public function __construct(private float $amount) {}
    public function calculate(float $total): float {
        return min($this->amount, $total);
    }
}
```

### DIP — Depend on Abstractions

```php
// High-level policy depends on abstraction, not on database details
interface OrderRepository {
    public function save(Order $order): void;
}

class PlaceOrderHandler {
    public function __construct(private OrderRepository $repository) {}
    public function handle(PlaceOrderCommand $cmd): void {
        $order = Order::create($cmd->items);
        $this->repository->save($order);
    }
}
```

## Relationships Between Principles

The five principles complement and reinforce one another:

- **SRP + ISP**: Both narrow the surface area of a class or interface to a single, focused concern
- **OCP + DIP**: Abstractions are the mechanism that enables extension without modification
- **LSP + OCP**: Correct substitutability is essential for polymorphic extension to work
- **ISP + DIP**: Well-segregated interfaces make it easier to depend on precisely the right abstraction

## Common Misconceptions

- **"One method per class"** — SRP means one *reason to change*, not one method. A class can contain many methods as long as they all serve the same responsibility.
- **"Never modify existing code"** — OCP does not prohibit bug fixes. It means *new behavior* should be introducible without changing existing working code.
- **"Always use interfaces"** — DIP calls for depending on abstractions. Sometimes a well-crafted base class is the appropriate abstraction. Do not create interfaces for classes that will never have a second implementation.
- **"Inheritance is bad"** — LSP does not discourage inheritance. It establishes rules for *correct* inheritance so that subtypes remain safely substitutable.

## Best Practices

- Adopt SOLID incrementally — do not refactor everything in one pass
- Treat SOLID as a diagnostic tool: when code resists change, check which principle is being violated
- Pair with design patterns — Strategy (OCP), Adapter (DIP), and Decorator (OCP) are direct implementations of SOLID ideas
- Write tests first — TDD naturally steers designs toward SOLID compliance
- Target PHP 8.3+ with strict typing, readonly classes, and enums
