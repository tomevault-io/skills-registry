description: Django patterns, anti-patterns, ORM gotchas, view design, migrations, settings, and review checklist for Django backend work. Use whenever the project contains `manage.py`, `settings.py`, `apps.py`, OR `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt`/`Pipfile` with `django` (or `Django`) listed as a dependency, OR the user asks about Django, Python web backend, ORM queries, models, views, forms, templates, migrations, admin, signals, middleware, or any work touching `.py` files in a Django app structure, even if Django is not mentioned by name. Use when this capability is needed.

# Django patterns

Django 5.2 LTS (extended support through April 2028). Django 6.0 is current stable (non-LTS). Baseline for this skill is 5.2 LTS. Adapt advice to the version in the project's `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or lockfile.

DRF-specific patterns load when the project includes `djangorestframework` in dependencies.

## When to load this skill

- Project contains `manage.py`, `settings.py`, `apps.py`
- `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `Pipfile` lists `django` or `Django`
- User asks about Django, models, ORM, views, forms, templates, migrations, admin, signals, middleware

## When not to load this skill

- Pure FastAPI, Flask, or other Python web frameworks without Django
- Django REST Framework questions only (DRF-specific patterns live in their own skill)
