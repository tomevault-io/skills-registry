name: javascript-patterns
description: JavaScript language patterns, modern syntax, async handling, module systems (ESM/CJS), error handling, and review checklist for JavaScript code without TypeScript. Use whenever the project contains `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, or `.jsx` files (and no `tsconfig.json`), `package.json` without TypeScript dependencies, OR the user asks about JavaScript, JS, ECMAScript, async/await, promises, modules, ESM, CommonJS, package.json, npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, or any work in JavaScript code without explicit TypeScript usage, even if "JavaScript" is not mentioned by name. Use when this capability is needed.

# JavaScript patterns

Default assumption: a project running on the current Node.js Active LTS (Node 24, "Krypton") or a modern browser baseline. If the project also uses TypeScript, the type-aware skill applies on top of these language patterns. Adapt advice to the Node version in the project's `.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`, or `engines` field in `package.json`.

## Severity rubric

- `failure`: a concrete defect or violation that should not ship.
- `warning`: a smell or pattern that compounds with other findings.
- `info`: a hardening opportunity or note, not a defect.

## When to load this skill

- Any task touching `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, or `.jsx` files.
- Any task involving `package.json`, npm / pnpm / yarn / bun workflows, or Node runtime configuration.
- Code review where the diff includes module structure, async control flow, or error handling in JavaScript.
- Migrations between ESM and CJS, or between Node major versions.

## When not to load this skill

- TypeScript projects that already load type-aware patterns (this skill still applies for the language-level rules, but `any`-vs-`unknown`, generics, and tsconfig live elsewhere).
- Projects with no JavaScript surface (pure backends in another language).

## Maintenance note

ECMAScript ships a new edition each June. New syntax tends to land in V8 and Node within a release cycle of being standardized; TC39 stage 3 proposals can sometimes land in Node behind a flag before reaching stage 4. When new syntax appears in a code review, check this skill against the current MDN page and the current Node Active LTS before relying on legacy guidance here. Dropping support for an older Node major in `engines.node` is a breaking change for downstream consumers; treat it as such.
