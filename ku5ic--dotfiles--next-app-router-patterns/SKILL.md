description: Next.js App Router patterns covering server/client boundary, data fetching and caching, server actions, streaming, parallel and intercepting routes, edge vs node runtime, and review checklist. Use whenever the project contains `next.config.js`, `next.config.mjs`, `next.config.ts`, an `app/` directory with `page.tsx`/`page.jsx`/`layout.tsx`/`layout.jsx`/`route.ts`, OR `next` in `package.json` dependencies, OR the user asks about Next.js, App Router, server components, client components, server actions, route handlers, parallel routes, intercepting routes, streaming, generateMetadata, generateStaticParams, even if Next.js is not mentioned by name. Use when this capability is needed.

# Next.js App Router patterns

Default assumption: Next.js 16 (current stable as of writing) with the App Router. Pages Router patterns are out of scope. Cache Components is the new caching model in 16 (opt-in via `cacheComponents: true`); the previous caching model is still supported when the flag is off. Verify via `package.json` or lockfile; caching model and `cacheComponents` flag differ between 15.x and 16.x.

## Severity rubric

- `failure`: a concrete defect or violation that should not ship.
- `warning`: a smell or pattern that compounds with other findings.
- `info`: a hardening opportunity or note, not a defect.

## When to load this skill

- Any task touching files under `app/` (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `route.ts`, `loading.tsx`, etc.).
- Any task involving `next.config.*`, `proxy.ts` / `middleware.ts`, or Next-specific imports (`next/cache`, `next/server`, `next/image`, `next/font`, `next/dynamic`, `next/navigation`, `next/headers`).
- Code review where the diff includes server/client boundary changes, cache directives, server actions, or route segment configuration.
- Migrations from Pages Router to App Router, or between Next.js majors.

## When not to load this skill

- Pages Router projects (`pages/` only, no `app/` directory). The patterns differ enough that this skill would mislead.
- React projects without Next.js (use the React skill alone).

## Maintenance note

Next.js ships major releases roughly yearly and minor releases monthly. File conventions, cache defaults, and directive names have shifted multiple times: PPR went from preview to stable in 16, `middleware` was renamed to `proxy` in 16, `fetch` default cache behavior changed in 15. Verify any version-sensitive claim against the current docs at https://nextjs.org/docs and the release entries at https://nextjs.org/blog before relying on it. The Pages Router still exists in 16 but is not covered here.
