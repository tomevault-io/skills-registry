description: Vue 3 Composition API patterns, reactivity, single-file components, anti-patterns, and review checklist. Use whenever the project contains `.vue` files, `vue` in `package.json` dependencies, `vite.config.*` with the Vue plugin, OR the user asks about Vue, Vue 3, Composition API, ref, reactive, computed, watch, watchEffect, defineProps, defineEmits, defineSlots, script setup, single-file components, Pinia, even if Vue is not mentioned by name. Use when this capability is needed.

# Vue patterns

Default assumption: Vue 3 with the Composition API and `<script setup>` syntax. Current stable is Vue 3.5; deltas in 3.5+ (Reactive Props Destructure, `onWatcherCleanup`, `defineModel`) are called out where they matter. Options API is acceptable for legacy code; flag as legacy when reviewed.

## Severity rubric

- `failure`: a concrete defect or violation that should not ship.
- `warning`: a smell or pattern that compounds with other findings.
- `info`: a hardening opportunity or note, not a defect.

## When to load this skill

- Any task touching `.vue` files (Single-File Components).
- Any task involving Vue Composition API primitives, custom composables, or Pinia stores.
- Code review where the diff includes reactivity, watchers, or component boundary changes.
- Migrations between Vue 3 minor versions (especially 3.4 -> 3.5 for reactive props destructure).

## When not to load this skill

- Vue 2 projects. The Options API is the default and the reactivity model is fundamentally different. Flag the project's Vue major and stop; the patterns here will mislead.
- React projects. Despite surface similarities (component tree, hooks-like primitives), the reactivity models differ.

## Maintenance note

Vue 3.5 introduced Reactive Props Destructure (replacing the `withDefaults` ergonomic) and `onWatcherCleanup`. Vue 3.4 introduced `defineModel` and watcher `once: true`. Vue 3.3 introduced `defineSlots` and tuple-style `defineEmits` types. When new syntax appears in a code review, check this skill against the current changelog before relying on legacy guidance. Vue 2 reaches end-of-life status; new projects should be Vue 3, and Vue-2-only patterns are out of scope here.
