## Writing Guidelines

Handoff summaries are high hallucination risk. Apply these constraints:

- **Distinguish completion status**: "completed" (verified working), "attempted" (may have issues), "discussed" (not implemented)
- **Quote user's exact words** for preferences, constraints, and requirements
- **Only include facts confirmed in conversation** -- do not infer unstated decisions or requirements
- **Mark uncertainty**: If unsure about a detail, write "[needs confirmation]"
- **Capture the user's actual preferences** (e.g., "no emojis", "Korean responses"), not inferred ones

## Self-Verification (Required)

Before saving the file, verify:

- [ ] Every "completed" item has evidence in the conversation
- [ ] No tasks listed as done that were only discussed or attempted
- [ ] User preferences accurately reflect stated preferences, not inferred ones
- [ ] Technical decisions include rationale from actual conversation, not fabricated reasoning
- [ ] Pending tasks distinguish user-requested from agent-suggested
- [ ] No information fabricated to "fill" template sections -- leave empty if nothing to report
