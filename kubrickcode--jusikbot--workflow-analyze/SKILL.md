# Issue Analysis Command

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

---

## Outline

1. **Parse User Input**:
   - Extract task description from $ARGUMENTS
   - Generate task name (2-4 words, English, hyphen-separated)

2. **Define Problem**:
   - Identify current situation, problem to solve, and goals

3. **Investigate Solutions**:
   - Research 2-4 approaches
   - Analyze pros/cons of each approach
   - Evaluate based on coding principles

4. **Assess Decision Confidence & Final Selection**:
   - After completing ALL analysis, assess decision confidence (see Decision Honesty rule)
   - **Decisive** → Select the approach, clarify rejection reasons
   - **Advisory** → Recommend the approach, present alternatives with deciding factors for user

5. **Generate Questions**:
   - Select **maximum 3** unclear items only
   - Use reasonable defaults + Assumptions for the rest

6. **ADR Assessment**:
   - After completing the analysis, evaluate whether the decision meets ADR criteria (PRICE)
   - If any PRICE criterion applies, add the ADR assessment section to the document

7. **Write Document**:
   - Create `docs/work/{task-name}/analysis.md` (Korean)

## Key Rules

### 📝 Documentation Language

**CRITICAL**: All documents must be written in **Korean**.

### 📝 Writing Order

**Complete the analysis body (Problem Definition through Solution Investigation) in your reasoning first.
Write the Conclusion (TL;DR) section last, even though it appears first in the document.**

### 🎯 Balanced Analysis Principles

1. **Problem Definition**: Include concrete scenarios rather than abstract descriptions
2. **Solution Approach**: Consider both user perspective and technical feasibility
3. **Implementation Method**: Keep core changes concise, specify new dependencies
4. **Completion Criteria**: Separate feature verification and technical implementation
5. **Weighted Evaluation**: Not all pros/cons are equal. Identify which criteria matter most for this problem before comparing. A single critical advantage can outweigh multiple minor ones.

### 🎭 Anti-Bias Rules (CRITICAL)

**Core Principle: Be honest. Don't hide what exists, don't invent what doesn't.**

1. **Analyze First, Conclude Later**
   - Complete ALL approach analysis BEFORE making any selection

2. **Write What's True**
   - If A has 5 pros and B has 1, write exactly that (no forced balance)
   - If side effects exist, state them; if none, say so (no hiding, no inventing)
   - When rejecting an approach, acknowledge what you're giving up

3. **Neutral Language**
   - Forbidden: "simply", "obviously", "clearly", "just", "merely"
   - Use: "may", "could", "potentially"

4. **Decision Honesty (CRITICAL)**
   - After completing all analysis, assess decision confidence before writing the conclusion
   - **Decisive** (select definitively) — ALL conditions must be met:
     - One approach is superior or equal in all evaluation dimensions, inferior in none (Pareto dominant)
     - OR a technical/project constraint eliminates other approaches
     - OR an explicit, unambiguous project convention determines the answer
     - AND the deciding factor does NOT depend on user/team preferences or business context unknown to you
   - **Advisory** (recommend, let user decide) — ANY condition is sufficient:
     - Approaches have comparable trade-off profiles with strengths in different dimensions (name the dimensions)
     - The deciding factor is a subjective preference (e.g., simplicity vs flexibility)
     - The choice requires business/product context you do not have
     - Risk tolerance or time horizon is the differentiator
     - Differences between approaches are marginal
   - **Default is Advisory.** Decisive requires proving no legitimate trade-off remains.
   - Do NOT manufacture certainty. If the honest answer is "these are close", say so.

   **Decision Type Examples**:
   - Decisive: Project uses PostgreSQL; Approach A is PostgreSQL-based, Approach B is MongoDB-only → technical constraint, Decisive
   - Advisory: Approach A is simpler but less extensible; Approach B is complex but highly extensible → depends on future scale and team preference → Advisory

   **Additional forbidden expressions when using Decisive**:
   - "no need to bother with ~" (dismissive of alternatives)
   - "practically the only choice" (unless literally one option remains)
   - "other approaches are not realistic" (requires specific evidence)

### ✅ Must Do

- Conclusion first (Executive Summary)
- **Include concrete scenarios** (Problem Definition) - 1-4 cases depending on issue
- **Explain user impact** (Solution Approach) - How will it be used?
- **Evaluate technical feasibility** (Solution Approach) - Why is it suitable?
- Evaluate solutions based on coding principles
- **NEEDS CLARIFICATION maximum 3** - use reasonable defaults for the rest

### ❌ Must Not Do

- **Only abstract problem definitions** (without concrete examples)
- **Excessive technical details** (going into implementation level)
- **Missing user perspective** (talking only about technology)
- **Listing obvious things** (e.g., React state, JSON schema)

## 🔍 Objectivity Self-Check

- [ ] Wrote what's true (no hiding, no inventing)
- [ ] Rejected approaches' lost benefits acknowledged
- [ ] Used neutral language ("may/could", not "will/obviously")
- [ ] Decision confidence honestly assessed (did not force certainty on a subjective choice)
- [ ] **If Decisive**: Would a colleague with a different opinion still find this convincing?
- [ ] **If Decisive**: Were alternative approaches' strengths not understated?
```

## Execution

Now start the task according to the guidelines above.
