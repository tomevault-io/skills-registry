# Go Coding Standards

## Basic Principles

### One Function, One Responsibility

- If function name connects with "and" or "or", it's a signal to split
- If test cases are needed for each if branch, it's a signal to split

### Conditional and Loop Depth Limited to 2 Levels

- Minimize depth using early return whenever possible
- If still heavy, extract into separate functions

### Make Function Side Effects Explicit

- Example: If `getUser` also runs `updateLastAccess()`, specify it in the function name

### Convert Magic Numbers/Strings to Constants When Possible

- Declare at the top of the file where used
- Consider separating into a constants file if there are many

### Function Order by Call Order

- Follow Go's clear conventions if they exist
- Otherwise, order top-to-bottom for easy reading by call order

### Review External Libraries for Complex Implementations

- When logic is complex and tests become bloated
- If industry-standard libraries exist, use them
- When security, accuracy, or performance optimization is critical
- When platform compatibility or edge cases are numerous

### Modularization (Prevent Code Duplication and Pattern Repetition)

- Absolutely forbid code repetition
- Modularize similar patterns into reusable forms
- Allow pre-modularization if reuse is confirmed
- Avoid excessive abstraction
- Modularization levels:
  - Same file: Extract into separate function
  - Multiple files: Separate into different package
  - Multiple projects/domains: Separate into different module

### Variable and Function Names

- Clear purpose while being concise
- Forbid abbreviations outside industry standards (id, api, db, err, etc.)
- Don't repeat context from the parent scope
- Boolean variables use `is`, `has`, `should` prefixes
- Function names are verbs or verb+noun forms
- Plural rules:
  - Pure arrays/slices: "s" suffix (`users`)
  - Wrapped struct: "list" suffix (`userList`)
  - Specific data structure: Explicit (`userSet`, `userMap`)
  - Already plural words: Use as-is

### Field Order

- Alphabetically ascending by default
- Maintain consistency in usage

### Error Handling

- Error handling level: Handle where meaningful response is possible
- Error messages: Technical details for logs, actionable guidance for users
- Error classification: Distinguish between expected and unexpected errors
- Error propagation: Add context when propagating up the call stack
- Recovery vs. fast fail: Recover from expected errors with fallback
- Use %w for error chains, %v for simple logging
- Wrap internal errors not to be exposed with %v
- Never ignore return errors from functions; handle them explicitly
- Sentinel errors: For expected conditions that callers must handle, use `var ErrNotFound = errors.New("not found")`

## File Structure

### Element Order in File

1. package declaration
2. import statements (grouped)
3. Constant definitions (const)
4. Variable definitions (var)
5. Type/Interface/Struct definitions
6. Constructor functions (New\*)
7. Methods (grouped by receiver type, alphabetically ordered)
8. Helper functions (alphabetically ordered)

## Interfaces and Structs

### Interface Definition Location

- Define interfaces in the package that uses them (Accept interfaces, return structs)
- Only separate shared interfaces used by multiple packages

### Pointer Receiver Rules

- Use pointer receivers for state modification, large structs (3+ fields), or when consistency is needed
- Use value receivers otherwise

## Context Usage

### Context Parameter

- Always pass as the first parameter
- Use `context.Background()` only in main and tests

## Testing

### Testing Libraries

- Prefer standard library's if + t.Errorf over assertion libraries like testify
- Prefer manual mocking over gomock

## Forbidden Practices

### init() Functions

- Generally forbidden. Prefer explicit initialization functions

## Package Structure

### internal Package

- Actively use for libraries, use only when necessary for applications

## Recommended Libraries

- Web: Fiber
- DB: Bun, SQLBoiler (when managing migrations externally)
- Logging: slog
- CLI: cobra
- Utilities: samber/lo, golang.org/x/sync
- Configuration: koanf (viper if cobra integration needed)
- Validation: go-playground/validator/v10
- Scheduling: github.com/go-co-op/gocron
- Image processing: github.com/h2non/bimg
