# TypeScript Coding Standards

## Basic Principles

### One Function, One Responsibility

- If function name connects with "and" or "or", it's a signal to split
- If test cases are needed for each if branch, it's a signal to split

### Conditional and Loop Depth Limited to 2 Levels

- Minimize depth using early return whenever possible
- If still heavy, extract into separate functions

### Make Function Side Effects Explicit

- Example: If `getUser` also runs `updateLastAccess()`, specify it in the function name

### Convert Magic Numbers/Strings to Constants When Possible

- Declare at the top of the file or class where used
- Consider separating into a constants file if there are many

### Function Order by Call Order

- Follow class access modifier declaration order rules if clear
- Otherwise, order top-to-bottom for easy reading by call order

### Review External Libraries for Complex Implementations

- When logic is complex and tests become bloated
- If industry-standard libraries exist, use them
- When security, accuracy, or performance optimization is critical
- When browser/platform compatibility or edge cases are numerous

### Modularization (Prevent Code Duplication and Pattern Repetition)

- Absolutely forbid code repetition
- Modularize similar patterns into reusable forms
- Allow pre-modularization if reuse is confirmed
- Avoid excessive abstraction
- Modularization levels:
  - Same file: Extract into separate function
  - Multiple files: Separate into different file
  - Multiple projects/domains: Separate into package

### Variable and Function Names

- Clear purpose while being concise
- Forbid abbreviations outside industry standards (id, api, db, err, etc.)
- Don't repeat context from the parent scope
- Boolean variables use `is`, `has`, `should` prefixes
- Function names are verbs or verb+noun forms
- Plural rules:
  - Pure arrays: "s" suffix (`users`)
  - Wrapped object: "list" suffix (`userList`)
  - Specific data structure: Explicit (`userSet`, `userMap`)
  - Already plural words: Use as-is

### Field Order

- Alphabetically ascending by default
- Maintain consistency in usage
- Also alphabetically ordered in destructuring assignment

### Error Handling

- Error handling level: Handle where meaningful response is possible
- Error messages: Technical details for logs, actionable guidance for users
- Error classification: Distinguish between expected and unexpected errors
- Error propagation: Add context when propagating up the call stack
- Recovery vs. fast fail: Recover from expected errors with fallback
- Error types: For domain-specific failures, create custom error classes extending `Error`. Never throw non-Error objects
- Async errors: Always handle Promise rejection. Use try-catch for async/await, .catch() for promise chains

## Package Management

### Package Manager

- Use pnpm as default package manager
- Forbid npm, yarn (prevent lock file conflicts)

## File Structure

### Common for All Files

1. Import statements (grouped)
2. Constant definitions (alphabetically ordered if multiple)
3. Type/Interface definitions (alphabetically ordered if multiple)
4. Main content (see below)

### Inside Classes

- Decorators
- private readonly members
- readonly members
- constructor
- public methods (alphabetically ordered)
- protected methods (alphabetically ordered)
- private methods (alphabetically ordered)

### Function Placement in Function-Based Files

- Main exported function
- Additional exported functions (alphabetically ordered, avoid many)
- Helper functions

## Function Writing

### Use Arrow Functions

- Always use arrow functions except for class methods
- Forbid function keyword entirely (exceptions: generator function\*, function hoisting etc. technically impossible cases only)

### Function Arguments: Flat vs Object

- Use flat if single argument or uncertain of future additions
- Use object form for 2+ arguments in most cases. Allow flat form when:
  - All required arguments without boolean arguments
  - All required arguments with clear order (e.g., (width,height), (start,end), (min,max), (from,to))

## Type System

### Type Safety

- Forbid unsafe type bypasses like any, as, !, @ts-ignore, @ts-expect-error
- Exceptions: Missing or incorrect external library types, rapid development needed (clarify reason in comments)
- Allow some unknown type when type guard is clear
- Allow as assertion when literal type (as const) needed
- Allow as assertion when widening literal/HTML types to broader types
- Allow "!" assertion when type narrowing impossible after type guard due to TypeScript limitation
- Allow @ts-ignore, @ts-expect-error in test code (absolutely forbid in production)

### Interface vs Type

- Prioritize Type in all cases by default
- Use Interface only for these exceptions:
  - Public API provided to external users like library public API
  - Need to extend existing interface like external libraries
  - Designing OOP-style classes where implementation contract must be clearly defined

### null/undefined Handling

- Actively use Optional Chaining (`?.`)
- Provide defaults with Nullish Coalescing (`??`)
- Distinguish between `null` and `undefined` by semantic meaning:
  - `undefined`: Uninitialized state, optional parameters, value not assigned yet
  - `null`: Intentional absence of value (similar to Go's nil)
- Examples:
  - Optional field: `{ name?: string }` → can be `undefined`
  - Intentionally cleared value: `user.profileImage = null`
  - External API responses may use either convention

## Code Style

### Maintain Immutability

- Use `const` whenever possible, minimize `let`
- Create new values instead of directly modifying arrays/objects
- Use `spread`, `filter`, `map` instead of `push`, `splice`
- Exceptions: Extremely performance-critical cases

## Recommended Libraries

- Testing: Jest, Playwright
- Utilities: es-toolkit, dayjs
- HTTP: ky, @tanstack/query, @apollo/client
- Form: React Hook Form
- Type validation: zod
- UI: Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- ORM: Prisma (Drizzle if edge support important)
- State management: zustand
- Code formatting: prettier, eslint
- Build: tsup
