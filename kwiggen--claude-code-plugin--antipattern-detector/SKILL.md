# Anti-Pattern Detector

Identifies recurring failure patterns in plans and decisions. Anti-patterns look reasonable on the surface but lead to predictable problems. Detecting them early saves months of pain.

## Anti-Pattern Categories

### 1. Architecture Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Symptoms |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Big Ball of Mud** | No clear structure, everything coupled | Can't change X without breaking Y |
| **Golden Hammer** | Using one approach for everything | "We'll use [tool] for that too" |
| **Premature Microservices** | Splitting before understanding boundaries | 3 people managing 20 services |
| **Distributed Monolith** | Microservices with tight coupling | Must deploy all services together |
| **Resume-Driven Development** | Choices for career, not product | "Let's use Rust for the admin panel" |

### 2. Timeline Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Symptoms |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Timeline Fantasy** | Optimistic estimates ignoring reality | "6 weeks if everything goes well" |
| **Scope Creep Blindness** | Not accounting for inevitable growth | Same deadline, 2x scope |
| **Parallel Path Delusion** | Assuming unlimited parallelization | "Add more people to go faster" |
| **MVP Maximalism** | MVP that's actually V3 | 47 features in "minimum" product |
| **Demo-Driven Development** | Building for demos, not production | "It works on my machine" |

### 3. Team Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Symptoms |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Hero Culture** | Reliance on key individuals | "Only Sarah can fix that" |
| **Knowledge Silos** | Critical info in one person's head | Bus factor of 1 |
| **Conway's Law Violation** | Structure doesn't match team | Boundaries don't align |
| **Understaffed Ambition** | Big plans with tiny teams | 2 people building "the platform" |
| **Absent Ownership** | No clear owner for components | Issues fall through cracks |

### 4. Process Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Symptoms |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Cargo Cult Agile** | Ceremonies without principles | Standups but no shipping |
| **Analysis Paralysis** | Over-planning, under-executing | Month 3 of "finalizing requirements" |
| **Infinite Refactoring** | Never shipping, always improving | "One more cleanup before release" |
| **Documentation Theater** | Docs that no one reads | 200-page spec, outdated day 1 |
| **Meeting Madness** | More meetings than doing | "Let's schedule a meeting" |

### 5. Technology Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Symptoms |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Shiny Object Syndrome** | Chasing latest tech without reason | "Rewrite in [new hotness]" |
| **Not Invented Here** | Building what should be bought | Custom auth, custom logging, custom everything |
| **Vendor Lock-in Denial** | Ignoring exit costs | "We can always migrate later" |
| **Premature Optimization** | Optimizing before measuring | Caching layer with 10 users |
| **Framework Overload** | Too many frameworks/libraries | 47 dependencies for a button |

## Detection Process

### Step 1: Scan for Signals

Look for phrases that indicate anti-patterns:

**Timeline signals**: "If everything goes well...", "We can do it faster if...", "Just need to hire...", "Should only take..."

**Architecture signals**: "We'll figure out boundaries later...", "Everything talks to everything...", "It's only temporary...", "We can always refactor..."

**Team signals**: "Only [person] knows...", "We'll hire for that...", "[Person] will handle all of...", "The team can absorb..."

**Process signals**: "We don't need docs...", "We'll add tests later...", "Let's discuss in the meeting...", "Requirements are evolving..."

### Step 2: Verify Pattern Match

For each suspected anti-pattern:
1. **Identify**: Which specific pattern?
2. **Evidence**: What in the plan matches?
3. **Severity**: How bad? (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
4. **Context**: Could this be a reasonable exception?

### Step 3: Check for Combinations

Certain patterns appear together and compound risk:

**Startup Death Spiral**: Timeline Fantasy + Understaffed Ambition + Hero Culture
- Result: Burnout, missed deadlines, key person leaves

**Enterprise Trap**: Analysis Paralysis + Documentation Theater + Meeting Madness
- Result: Nothing ships, team frustrated, competition wins

**Tech Debt Avalanche**: "Refactor later" + No ownership + Premature optimization
- Result: System unmaintainable, rewrite required

**Microservices Mistake**: Premature Microservices + Distributed Monolith + Understaffed
- Result: Complexity explosion, slower than monolith

## Severity Framework

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Critical** | Will cause failure if not addressed | Stop and fix before proceeding |
| **High** | Will cause significant problems | Address in planning phase |
| **Medium** | Will cause friction and delays | Include in risk mitigation |
| **Low** | Worth noting but manageable | Track and address opportunistically |

## When to Use This Skill

Use **antipattern-detector** for recognizing known failure patterns (architecture, timeline, team, process, technology). Use **assumption-challenger** for surfacing hidden assumptions treated as facts. Both run together in `/validate`.

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

Before presenting an analysis, verify:

- [ ] Every detected pattern includes a direct evidence quote from the plan
- [ ] Every pattern has a severity rating (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Pattern combinations are checked and reported
- [ ] "Patterns NOT Detected" section is included for confidence
- [ ] Fixes are specific and actionable, not generic advice

## Output Format

```markdown
# Anti-Pattern Analysis: [Plan Name]

## Summary
- **Patterns Detected**: [Count]
- **Critical**: [Count] | **High**: [Count] | **Medium**: [Count] | **Low**: [Count]
- **Overall Risk Level**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Pattern Combinations Found**: [List any compound patterns]

## Critical Issues (Must Address)

### [Pattern Name]
**Category**: [Category] | **Severity**: Critical
**Evidence**: [What triggered detection]
**Risk**: [What will go wrong]
**Fix**: [How to address]

## High-Priority Issues (Should Address)
[Same format]

## Medium-Priority Issues (Consider Addressing)
