# Assumption Challenger

Systematically surfaces and stress-tests assumptions treated as facts but never validated. Most failures trace back to invalid assumptions — catching them early prevents costly mistakes.

## Assumption Categories

### 1. Timeline Assumptions
Assumptions about how long things will take.

**Red flags**: "This should only take...", "If everything goes well...", "The team can absorb this..."

**Challenge with**:
- What's this estimate based on? Past experience or hope?
- What similar work has been done before? How long did it actually take?
- What's NOT included? (Testing, docs, deployment, iteration)
- What happens if this takes 2x longer?

### 2. Resource Assumptions
Assumptions about team capacity and availability.

**Red flags**: "We'll hire by Q2...", "The team can support this...", "Sarah can lead this while..."

**Challenge with**:
- What's the actual hiring timeline? What if you can't find the right people?
- What's the team's current utilization? Where does time come from?
- Who's the backup if the key person is unavailable?
- What happens at 50% of expected capacity?

### 3. Technical Assumptions
Assumptions about system capabilities and constraints.

**Red flags**: "The system can handle the load...", "We can integrate easily...", "Our architecture supports..."

**Challenge with**:
- Has this been tested at the required scale?
- What are the documented limits? What happens at those limits?
- What's the failure mode? How do you recover?
- Have you talked to the API provider about your usage patterns?

### 4. Business Assumptions
Assumptions about market, users, and outcomes.

**Red flags**: "Users want this...", "This will reduce churn by...", "The market will wait..."

**Challenge with**:
- What evidence supports this? Research? Data? Or intuition?
- What if users don't adopt? What's the fallback?
- What are competitors doing in this space?
- How will you know if this assumption is wrong?

### 5. External Assumptions
Assumptions about factors outside your control.

**Red flags**: "The vendor will deliver...", "Regulations won't change...", "The market stays stable..."

**Challenge with**:
- What's the contingency if this doesn't happen?
- What's the vendor's track record on commitments?
- What early warning signs would indicate this is wrong?

## Process

### Step 1: Surface Assumptions

Read the plan and flag statements treated as facts without validation:

- "We will..." (without evidence)
- "We can..." (without proof)
- "Users want..." (without data)
- "It should..." (without testing)
- "We expect..." (without basis)
- "We assume..." (at least they're honest)

### Step 2: Categorize and Assess

For each assumption, determine:

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Category** | Timeline / Resource / Technical / Business / External |
| **Stated or Implicit** | Was it acknowledged or hidden? |
| **Evidence For** | What supports it? |
| **Evidence Against** | What contradicts it? |
| **Risk if Wrong** | Impact on timeline, cost, success |
| **How to Validate** | What would prove or disprove it? |
| **Verdict** | Valid / Questionable / Invalid / Unknown |

### Step 3: Apply Challenge Patterns

For high-risk assumptions, apply these patterns:

**Reality Check** — Compare to external data:
> "You assume [X]. Industry data shows [Y]. What makes you different?"

**History Test** — Compare to past performance:
> "You assume [X]. Last time you attempted [similar], it took [Y]. What changed?"

**Stress Test** — Push to failure point:
> "You assume [X]. What happens when [stress scenario]?"

**Dependency Audit** — Trace dependencies:
> "For [assumption] to be true, what else must also be true?"

**Inverse Test** — Consider the opposite:
> "If [assumption] is wrong, what's the impact? What's Plan B?"

### Step 4: Prioritize

Focus on assumptions that are:
1. **High impact** — project fails if wrong
2. **Low evidence** — based on hope, not data
3. **Testable** — can be validated before commitment

## Wishful Thinking Indicators

Red flags that suggest hope rather than evidence:

- **Optimistic Timeline**: "Should only take...", "If we're focused..." — Reality: add 30-50% buffer
- **Magical Hiring**: "We'll just hire...", "Once we have the team..." — Reality: 3-6 months to hire senior, 2-3 months to productive
- **Simple Integration**: "It's just an API call...", "Should be straightforward..." — Reality: edge cases, rate limits, surprises always
- **Obvious Market**: "Everyone needs this...", "Users have been asking..." — Reality: "everyone" is not a segment
- **Linear Scaling**: "If we can do X, we can do 10X..." — Reality: scaling is non-linear

## When to Use This Skill

Use **assumption-challenger** for surfacing hidden assumptions and stress-testing them with evidence. Use **antipattern-detector** for recognizing known failure patterns. Both run together in `/validate`.

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

Before presenting an analysis, verify:

- [ ] Every assumption includes all 7 table fields (Category, Stated/Implicit, Evidence For, Evidence Against, Risk if Wrong, How to Validate, Verdict)
- [ ] "How to Validate" entries are executable actions, not vague suggestions
- [ ] Verdicts are assigned (Valid/Questionable/Invalid/Unknown)
- [ ] Assumptions are prioritized by impact × uncertainty
- [ ] Wishful thinking indicators are flagged with specific quotes
