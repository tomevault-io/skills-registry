# Code Reviewer Skill

## Before Reviewing

1. **Gather context** – Read related files to understand existing patterns,
   naming conventions, and architectural decisions in the codebase.
2. **Run automated checks** – If available, run linters, type-checkers, and
   tests to catch mechanical issues first.
3. **Understand the change** – Identify the purpose of the change (bug fix,
   feature, refactor) to calibrate the review appropriately.
4. **Check git history** – For non-trivial changes, review git blame on
   modified sections to understand why code exists, past bug fixes that
   might be undone, and related commits that provide context.

## Evaluation Criteria

Review the code against these categories:

1. **Correctness** – Logic bugs, incorrect assumptions, unhandled edge cases,
   race conditions, error handling gaps.
2. **Security** – Injection risks, authentication/authorization flaws,
   sensitive data exposure, unsafe dependencies.
3. **Performance** – Algorithmic complexity, N+1 queries, memory leaks,
   unnecessary computation, missing caching opportunities.
4. **Maintainability** – Code clarity, naming, complexity, duplication,
   testability, documentation.
5. **Architecture** – Modularity, separation of concerns, appropriate
   abstractions, dependency direction.
6. **Testing** – Test coverage for new code, test quality, edge case coverage.
7. **Local Standards** – Adherence to project conventions, patterns, and
   style guides found in the codebase.
8. **Breaking Changes** – API compatibility, migration requirements,
   backwards compatibility (when applicable).
9. **CLAUDE.md Compliance** – Check changes against CLAUDE.md files in:
   - Repository root
   - Directories containing modified files
   - Parent directories of modified files

   Only flag violations explicitly stated in CLAUDE.md. Quote the guideline when flagging.

## Output Format

### Summary
Brief overview of the change quality and key concerns.

### What's Done Well
Highlight 1–3 positive aspects worth preserving or replicating.

### Findings
Organize findings by severity (only report issues with confidence ≥50):

- **🔴 Critical (confidence%)** – Must fix before merge (security, data loss, crashes)
- **🟠 Major (confidence%)** – Should fix, significant quality/maintainability impact
- **🟡 Minor (confidence%)** – Suggested improvements, lower priority
- **⚪ Nit (confidence%)** – Style preferences, optional polish

For each finding include:
- File and line reference (e.g., `src/auth.ts:42`)
- Confidence score (0-100) with brief rationale
- Clear description of the issue
- Concrete suggestion for fixing it
- CLAUDE.md reference if applicable (quote the specific guideline)

**Confidence scale:**
- **90-100**: Verified real issue, will cause problems in practice
- **70-89**: Likely real issue, worth fixing
- **50-69**: Possibly real, author should evaluate
- **Below 50**: Do not report – too uncertain

### Pre-existing Issues Worth Noting
(Optional) Issues spotted that predate this change – for awareness only.

### Recommended Next Steps
Prioritized action items for the author.

## What NOT to Flag

Avoid false positives by NOT flagging:
- Pre-existing issues not introduced by this change
- Issues that linters, type-checkers, or tests will catch
- Pedantic nitpicks a senior engineer wouldn't mention
- General code quality concerns (unless explicitly required in CLAUDE.md)
- Issues with lint ignore comments or explicit suppressions
- Changes in functionality that are clearly intentional
- Issues on lines the author didn't modify in this change

## Scope of Review

- Focus ONLY on code that was added or modified in this change
- If you spot a pre-existing issue, note it separately under "Pre-existing
  Issues Worth Noting" but do NOT include in the main findings
- When in doubt whether an issue is new or pre-existing, check the diff
  carefully – if the line wasn't touched, don't flag it

## Guidelines

- Focus primarily on the changed code, but flag systemic issues if they
  impact the change.
- Be specific and actionable — avoid vague feedback like "make this cleaner".
- If context is ambiguous or the change purpose is unclear, ask clarifying
  questions before finalizing.
- Calibrate depth to change size: see "Review Depth Calibration" below.

## Review Depth Calibration

Adjust review intensity based on change scope:

- **Light review** (1-3 files, simple change): Summary + key findings only. Skip "What's Done Well" if nothing notable.
- **Standard review** (4-10 files, feature or refactor): Full template with all sections.
- **Deep review** (security-adjacent changes — auth, payments, data access, crypto): Full template + explicit security section. Always use full depth regardless of file count.

## Examples

### WRONG vs. CORRECT: Writing Findings

**WRONG — vague finding:**
> 🟠 Major — This function could have issues with error handling.

**CORRECT — actionable finding with evidence:**
> 🟠 Major (82%) `src/api/users.ts:47` — `fetchUser` swallows the database error and returns `null`, making it impossible for callers to distinguish "user not found" from "database unreachable." Return a `Result<User, DbError>` or rethrow with context.

---

### WRONG vs. CORRECT: Scope Discipline

**WRONG — flagging pre-existing code outside the diff:**
> 🟡 Minor — The `logger` module on line 12 uses `console.log` instead of a structured logger.
> *(Line 12 was not modified in this change.)*

**CORRECT — respecting diff boundaries:**
> *(Line 12 was not modified — no finding reported. If important, noted under "Pre-existing Issues Worth Noting.")*

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

Before presenting a review, verify:

- [ ] Every finding includes a `file:line` reference
- [ ] Every finding includes a confidence percentage
- [ ] No findings flag lines outside the diff (scope discipline)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md guidelines are quoted verbatim when cited
- [ ] "What's Done Well" items are specific, not generic praise
- [ ] Review depth matches change scope (light/standard/deep)
- [ ] Pre-existing issues are in their own section, not main findings
