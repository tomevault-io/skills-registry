# Gemini Dual Code Review Skill

## Before Reviewing

1. **Check Gemini availability** — Run `test -n "$GEMINI_API_KEY"` via Bash to verify
   the API key is configured. If it fails, inform the user and fall back to a
   Claude-only review using the code-reviewer skill.
2. **Gather context** — Read related files to understand existing patterns,
   naming conventions, and architectural decisions.
3. **Collect the diff** — Use the same scope resolution as code-reviewer:
   - `1` → Uncommitted changes (`git diff` + `git diff --cached`)
   - `2` → Last local commit (`git show HEAD`)
   - `3` → Unpushed local commits (`git diff @{upstream}..HEAD`)
   - `PR#` → GitHub PR diff (`gh pr diff <number>`)

## Dual Review Process

### Step 1: Send to Gemini

Pipe the diff to Gemini via Bash:

```bash
echo "<diff content>" | node {pluginDir}/dist/gemini/cli.js --prompt "Review this diff for:
1. Logic bugs, incorrect assumptions, unhandled edge cases
2. Security vulnerabilities (injection, auth, data exposure)
3. Performance issues (N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations)
4. Maintainability concerns (naming, complexity, duplication)
5. Missing test coverage

Format your response as:
## Summary
Brief overview of change quality.

## Findings
- **Critical** — Must fix (security, data loss, crashes)
- **Major** — Should fix (quality/maintainability impact)
- **Minor** — Nice to fix (lower priority improvements)

Include file:line references where possible.
Be specific and actionable. Do NOT flag pre-existing issues." --system "You are a senior code reviewer. Be thorough, specific, and actionable."
```

Capture Gemini's full response from the JSON output's `output` field.

### Step 2: Claude Review

Independently review the same diff using the code-reviewer skill evaluation
criteria. Do NOT look at Gemini's output first — form your own assessment.

### Step 3: Synthesis

Compare both reviews and present a unified report:

## Output Format

### Dual Code Review

**Scope:** [description of what was reviewed]

---

### Claude's Review
[Claude's independent findings using code-reviewer format]

---

### Gemini's Review
[Gemini's response, formatted cleanly]

---

### Synthesis

#### Agreements
Findings both reviewers identified (highest confidence).

#### Unique to Claude
Findings only Claude caught.

#### Unique to Gemini
Findings only Gemini caught.

#### Verdict
Overall assessment combining both perspectives. Note where reviewers
disagree and which assessment seems more accurate based on the code.

## Fallback Behavior

If Gemini API key is not configured or the call fails:
1. Inform the user: "Gemini API key not configured — running Claude-only review."
2. Proceed with a standard code-reviewer skill review.
3. Do NOT block the review because of Gemini unavailability.

## Guidelines

- Both reviews must be independent — do not let one influence the other.
- Present Gemini's output faithfully; do not rewrite or suppress its findings.
- If Gemini produces low-quality output, note it but still include it.
- The synthesis should add value, not just repeat findings.

## When to Use This Skill

Use **gemini-reviewer** for structured dual code reviews with synthesis (agreements, unique findings, verdict). Use **gemini-advisor** (`/ask-gemini`) for general second opinions on any topic, file, or question — not limited to code review.

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

Before presenting a dual review, verify:

- [ ] Claude's review was completed independently before reading Gemini's
- [ ] Gemini's output is presented faithfully without rewriting
- [ ] Synthesis contains all 3 sections: Agreements, Unique to Claude, Unique to Gemini
- [ ] Verdict addresses any disagreements between reviewers
- [ ] Fallback behavior was followed if Gemini was unavailable

## CLI Reference

If unsure about Gemini CLI flags, run:

```bash
node {pluginDir}/dist/gemini/cli.js --help
```
