# GitHub Insights Skill

Analyze team GitHub activity for the current repository.

## Available Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `prs-merged` | List all PRs merged in a time period |
| `leaderboard` | Rank contributors by PR count and lines changed |
| `activity` | Summary stats + leaderboard + day/hour breakdown |
| `time-to-merge` | Merge velocity per developer (avg/median) |
| `reviews` | Who reviews whose code |
| `pr-size` | Size distribution and bottleneck detection |
| `first-review` | Time to first review per developer |
| `review-balance` | Reviews given vs received ratio |
| `reverts` | Track reverts and hotfixes |
| `review-depth` | Detect rubber stamp reviews |
| `review-cycles` | Rounds of feedback before merge |
| `all` | Run all reports with visual separators |

## Usage

Run the compiled TypeScript CLI from the dist directory:

```bash
node {baseDir}/dist/insights/cli.js --action <ACTION> [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `--action` (required): One of the actions above
- `--days N`: Look back N days (default: 30)
- `--start YYYY-MM-DD`: Start date for custom range
- `--no-stats`: Skip line count fetching (faster for large repos)

### Examples

```bash
# PRs merged in last 30 days
node {baseDir}/dist/insights/cli.js --action prs-merged

# Leaderboard for last week
node {baseDir}/dist/insights/cli.js --action leaderboard --days 7

# Time to merge analysis
node {baseDir}/dist/insights/cli.js --action time-to-merge --days 30

# Review participation
node {baseDir}/dist/insights/cli.js --action reviews --days 30

# PR size analysis with bottleneck detection
node {baseDir}/dist/insights/cli.js --action pr-size --days 30

# Time to first review
node {baseDir}/dist/insights/cli.js --action first-review --days 30

# Review balance (given vs received)
node {baseDir}/dist/insights/cli.js --action review-balance --days 30

# Reverts and hotfixes tracking
node {baseDir}/dist/insights/cli.js --action reverts --days 30

# Rubber stamp detection
node {baseDir}/dist/insights/cli.js --action review-depth --days 30

# Review cycles (rounds of feedback)
node {baseDir}/dist/insights/cli.js --action review-cycles --days 30
```
