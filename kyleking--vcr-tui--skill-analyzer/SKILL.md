# Skill Analyzer - Identify Missing Skills

You are an expert at analyzing codebases to identify what Claude Skills would be most valuable. This skill helps audit existing skills and recommend new ones based on project characteristics.

## What is Skill Analysis?

Skill analysis examines a project to determine:
- What frameworks and tools are being used
- What domains require specialized knowledge
- What patterns are repeated across the codebase
- Where skills could reduce repetitive explanations
- What gaps exist in current skill coverage

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when the user:

- Asks to **analyze what skills are needed**
- Wants to **audit current skill coverage**
- Needs to **identify knowledge gaps**
- Asks **"what skills should I create?"**
- Wants to **optimize skill value for the project**
- Requests a **skill recommendation report**

## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Project Discovery

Identify key indicators of required skills:

**Dependency Analysis:**
```bash
# Python projects
cat requirements.txt pyproject.toml setup.py poetry.lock 2>/dev/null

# Node projects
cat package.json package-lock.json 2>/dev/null

# Other indicators
find . -name "*.toml" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.json" | grep -E "(config|package|project)"
```

**Framework Detection:**
```bash
# Look for framework imports
grep -r "^import\|^from" --include="*.py" | head -20

# Check for config files
ls -la | grep -E "\.(config|rc|yaml|json|toml)"
```

**Tool Detection:**
```bash
# Check for tool configs
ls -la .* | grep -E "(eslint|prettier|black|mypy|pytest|jest)"

# Check git hooks
ls -la .git/hooks/ 2>/dev/null
cat .git/config 2>/dev/null
```

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition

Look for patterns that indicate skill opportunities:

**Repeated Code Patterns:**
- Similar widget/component structures
- Common API interaction patterns
- Repeated test setups
- Standard error handling

**Domain-Specific Logic:**
- Business rules
- Data transformations
- Validation patterns
- State management

**Project Conventions:**
- File organization
- Naming conventions
- Testing strategies
- Code review patterns

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis

Compare discovered needs against existing skills:

```bash
# List current skills
ls .claude/skills/

# Check skill coverage
for skill in .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  echo "=== $(dirname $skill | xargs basename) ==="
  grep "^description:" "$skill"
done
```

**Evaluate:**
- What frameworks lack skills?
- What tools need guidance?
- What patterns are undocumented?
- What knowledge is tribal/unwritten?

## Skill Recommendation Criteria

### High Priority Skills

Create skills for:

## Analysis Techniques

### Framework Detection

**Python Projects:**

```bash
# Check imports
grep -rh "^import \|^from " --include="*.py" . | \
  cut -d' ' -f2 | cut -d'.' -f1 | sort -u | head -20

# Check dependencies
cat requirements*.txt setup.py pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null | \
  grep -E "^[a-zA-Z]" | cut -d'=' -f1 | sort -u
```

**Key frameworks to look for:**
- `textual`, `rich` - TUI frameworks
- `django`, `flask`, `fastapi` - Web frameworks
- `pytest`, `unittest` - Testing
- `sqlalchemy`, `django.db` - ORMs
- `pydantic` - Validation
- `click`, `typer` - CLI frameworks

### Tool Detection

**Look for config files:**

```bash
# Git hooks
ls -la .git/hooks/
cat hk.pkl .pre-commit-config.yaml 2>/dev/null

# Linters/formatters
ls -la .{black,ruff,pylint,mypy,eslint,prettier}* 2>/dev/null

# CI/CD
cat .github/workflows/*.yml .gitlab-ci.yml 2>/dev/null

# Container tools
ls -la Dockerfile* docker-compose*.yml 2>/dev/null
```

### Pattern Mining

**Identify repeated structures:**

```bash
# Find similar class definitions
grep -rh "^class " --include="*.py" . | \
  awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10

# Find common imports
grep -rh "^from textual" --include="*.py" . | \
  sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10

# Find repeated decorators
grep -rh "^@" --include="*.py" . | \
  sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
```

### Convention Discovery

**File organization:**
```bash
# Directory structure patterns
find . -type d -maxdepth 3 | head -20

# Naming conventions
find . -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" | \
  xargs basename -a | head -20
```

**Test patterns:**
```bash
# Test file structure
find . -name "test_*.py" -o -name "*_test.py"

# Test imports
grep -rh "^import pytest\|^from pytest" --include="test_*.py" . | \
  sort | uniq -c
```

## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Automatic Detection

Run automated analysis:

```bash
# Create analysis script
cat > analyze_skills.sh <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Project Analysis ==="
echo ""

echo "## Frameworks"
if [ -f pyproject.toml ]; then
  echo "Dependencies:"
  grep -E "^\[tool\.|dependencies" pyproject.toml -A 20
fi

echo ""
echo "## Tools"
ls -la .* 2>/dev/null | grep -E "(config|rc|yaml)"

echo ""
echo "## Patterns"
echo "Top imported modules:"
grep -rh "^from \|^import " --include="*.py" . 2>/dev/null | \
  awk '{print $2}' | cut -d'.' -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10

EOF

chmod +x analyze_skills.sh
./analyze_skills.sh
```

### Step 2: Manual Review

Examine:
- README.md and documentation
- Recent commit messages
- Issue tracker topics
- Code review comments
- Team discussions

### Step 3: Prioritization

Score potential skills:

**Impact (1-5):**
- How much would this skill help?
- How often would it be used?

**Effort (1-5):**
- How complex is the topic?
- How much content is needed?

**Priority Score = Impact / Effort**

Create high-score skills first.

### Step 4: Validation

Before creating a skill:

1. **Check existing coverage**: Does another skill overlap?
2. **Verify need**: Ask team members if this would be valuable
3. **Test scope**: Is it too broad or too narrow?
4. **Plan structure**: Sketch out main sections

3. Implement and validate
4. Maintain over time

**Workflow:**
```
skill-analyzer          →  skill-manager
  (identify needs)         (create/update skills)
```

## Reporting Formats

### Quick Audit

For rapid assessment:

```
Current Skills: 2
Missing High-Priority: 2
  - pytest-patterns (testing conventions)
  - async-patterns (async/await guidance)
Missing Medium-Priority: 1
  - project-conventions (file organization)

Next Action: Create pytest-patterns skill
```

### Comprehensive Report

For thorough analysis, use the full report template above with:
- Executive summary
- Detailed recommendations

- Prioritized roadmap

## Best Practices

### When Analyzing

**Do:**
- ✅ Examine actual code usage, not just dependencies
- ✅ Consider team pain points
- ✅ Look for repeated patterns
- ✅ Check for tribal knowledge
- ✅ Validate with team members

**Don't:**
- ❌ Recommend skills for every dependency
- ❌ Create skills for well-documented tools
- ❌ Ignore existing documentation
- ❌ Over-analyze simple projects
- ❌ Create skills no one will use

### Analysis Frequency

**Initial Setup:**
- Comprehensive analysis when starting Claude Skills

**Regular Reviews:**
- Quick audit monthly
- Full analysis quarterly
- After major dependency changes
- When new team members join

**Triggered Reviews:**
- New framework adopted
- Repeated questions on same topic
- Team requests skill for specific area

## Troubleshooting

### No Clear Skill Needs

**Problem:** Project seems too simple or too unique

**Solutions:**
- Focus on project conventions skill
- Document team patterns
- Create testing/quality skills
- Consider meta-skills (like skill-manager)

### Too Many Potential Skills

**Problem:** Everything seems like it needs a skill

**Solutions:**
- Prioritize by impact/effort
- Start with top 2-3
- Create comprehensive skills that cover multiple tools
- Focus on what's unique to your project

### Uncertain Value

**Problem:** Unclear if skill would be helpful

**Solutions:**
- Ask team members
- Try creating minimal version
- Test with actual questions
- Iterate based on usage

## Instructions for Using This Skill

When helping users analyze their project:

1. **Start with discovery**: Run automated detection scripts
2. **Examine patterns**: Look for repeated code structures
3. **Identify gaps**: Compare needs vs. existing skills
4. **Prioritize**: Use impact/effort framework
5. **Recommend**: Provide clear, actionable suggestions
6. **Create report**: Document findings and next steps

Always consider:
- What would provide most value?
- What does the team struggle with?
- What knowledge is undocumented?
- What's the right level of granularity?
