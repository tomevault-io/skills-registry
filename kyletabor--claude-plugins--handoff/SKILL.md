# Handoff Skill

Save the current session context so a fresh Claude session can pick up exactly where this one left off.

## When to Use

- User runs `/handoff` or `/handoff [notes]`
- User says they want to save context, switch sessions, or continue later
- User mentions context is getting full or compaction is losing detail

## Storage

- **Directory:** `/mnt/pi-data/claude-workspace/handoffs/`
- **Archive:** `/mnt/pi-data/claude-workspace/handoffs/archive/`
- **Backup:** Covered by pi-data Google Drive sync (backup-claude.sh)

## Instructions

When this skill activates, do the following:

### Step 1: Gather Context

Review the current conversation and identify:

1. **Session summary**: 2-3 sentence overview of what was happening this session
2. **Active goals**: What the user is trying to accomplish (the big picture)
3. **Unfinished work**: Tasks in progress, what's been done, what's left
4. **Key files**: Files that were being worked on (full absolute paths)
5. **Important decisions**: Any architectural, design, or strategic decisions made
6. **User's last intent**: What they were about to do or asked for last
7. **User notes**: If the user provided notes via `/handoff [notes]`, include them prominently

### Step 2: Generate Filename

**Convention:** `YYYY-MM-DDTHHMM-<bead-id>-<slug>.md`

1. Run `bd list --status=in_progress` to check for an active bead ID.
2. If a bead is active, include its ID (e.g., `kyle-dev-infra-234`).
3. If no bead, omit the bead portion.
4. Create a 3-5 word kebab-case slug summarizing the session's main work.

**Examples:**
- `2026-03-28T2042-kyle-dev-infra-234-fix-handoff-plugin.md`
- `2026-03-28T1530-treehouse-chat-ui-rebuild.md`
- `2026-03-29T0900-kyle-dev-infra-25j-total-recall-remote-push.md`

### Step 3: Write the Handoff Document

Format the context as a structured markdown document. Use this exact template:

```markdown
# Handoff Context

> Saved: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | Bead: <id or "none"> | Working dir: <pwd>

## Session Summary
[2-3 sentences]

## Active Goals
- [goal 1]
- [goal 2]

## Unfinished Work
- [ ] [task with status]
- [ ] [task with status]

## Key Files
- `/absolute/path/to/file1` - [what/why]
- `/absolute/path/to/file2` - [what/why]

## Important Decisions
- [decision and rationale]

## Last Intent
[What the user was about to do or asked for last]

## User Notes
[Any notes the user provided, or "None"]
```

### Step 4: Save to Two Places

**A) Save to claude-mem** for long-term searchable memory:

Use the `mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__save_memory` tool with:
- `title`: "HANDOFF: [brief summary of session]"
- `text`: The full handoff document from Step 3
- `project`: Use the current project name if known, otherwise omit

**B) Save to handoff file** for immediate injection on next startup:

Use the `Write` tool to write the handoff document to:
`/mnt/pi-data/claude-workspace/handoffs/<filename from Step 2>`

Ensure the directory exists first: `mkdir -p /mnt/pi-data/claude-workspace/handoffs`

### Step 5: Confirm

Tell the user:
- Context has been saved (include the filename)
- They can safely close Claude and start a fresh session
- The next session will automatically see pending handoffs on startup
- The context is also saved to long-term memory for future reference

Keep the confirmation brief -- 2-3 lines max.

## Important

- Be thorough in capturing context but concise in presentation
- Use absolute file paths, never relative
- If the session was short or simple, the handoff can be brief too -- don't pad it
- Handoff files are NEVER deleted -- they are archived via /handoff-clear
- Multiple handoffs can coexist -- each session gets its own file
