# Content Governance Review

Reviews content against comprehensive HMS IT content governance standards to ensure consistency, professionalism, clarity, and compliance across all communications.

## Overview

This skill analyzes content against HMS IT's comprehensive governance framework, which includes:

- **Core style guide**: Voice and tone, clarity and conciseness, formatting standards
- **Word list**: 300+ specific usage rules and terminology standards
- **Email guidelines**: Broadcast email composition, subject lines, messaging architecture
- **Knowledge base standards**: Article types, evergreen content rules, metadata requirements
- **Website and internal communications**: Page guidelines, intranet standards, policy templates

The skill identifies issues across multiple dimensions, categorizes them by severity, and can automatically fix many common violations with user approval.

## What you should do

When invoked to review content:

1. **Understand the request**:
   - Determine review mode: Quick Scan (fast, critical only), Comprehensive (complete analysis), or Targeted (specific aspect)
   - If not specified, infer from user's language: "quick check" → Quick Scan, "full review" → Comprehensive, "check word list" → Targeted
   - Identify content type: email, KB article, web page, internal doc, or general documentation

2. **Read the content**:
   - Use Read tool to load the file
   - Note file path for content type clues (/emails/, /kb/, /web/)
   - Scan for structural indicators (subject lines, article metadata, policy format)

3. **Detect content type** (if not obvious):
   - Check file path patterns
   - Look for content structure clues (email salutations, KB article types, SharePoint templates)
   - Use AskUserQuestion only if truly ambiguous after analysis

4. **Consult governance standards**:
   - Core standards: `REFERENCE.md` (style guide, word list)
   - Email-specific: `REFERENCE-EMAIL.md` (subject lines, phishing prevention)
   - KB-specific: `REFERENCE-KB.md` (evergreen content, article types)
   - Web/Internal: `REFERENCE-WEB-INTERNAL.md` (page guidelines, intranet)

5. **Perform review**:
   - **Voice/Tone**: Professional voice, active voice, present tense, no rhetorical questions
   - **Word Usage**: Check against 300+ word list entries, inclusive language, terminology
   - **Formatting**: Sentence case headings, monospace for code, straight quotes, date/time format
   - **Structure**: Paragraph length (≤6 sentences), heading quality, list formatting, parallel phrasing
   - **Platform-Specific**: Apply email/KB/web rules based on content type
   - Categorize each finding: Critical (affects meaning) → Important (consistency) → Minor (polish)
   - Flag auto-fixable issues: word replacements, capitalization, formatting

6. **Present findings**:
   - Organize by category (Voice/Tone, Word Usage, Formatting, Structure, Platform-Specific)
   - Within each category, order by severity (Critical → Important → Minor)
   - For each issue, provide:
     - Line number and context
     - Clear explanation of violation
     - Specific fix recommendation with example
     - Auto-fixable indicator (Yes/No)
   - Summarize: Total issues, breakdown by severity, auto-fixable count

7. **Offer batch fixes** (if auto-fixable issues exist):
   - List all proposed changes with before/after examples
   - Group by type (word list, capitalization, formatting)
   - Request single user approval for entire batch
   - Use AskUserQuestion only for genuinely ambiguous fixes (multiple valid options, context-dependent choices)
   - Apply approved fixes using Edit tool
   - Report summary: "Fixed 15 issues: 8 word list, 4 capitalization, 3 formatting"

8. **Handle manual fixes**:
   - For voice/tone, complex rewrites, and context-dependent issues
   - Provide guidance but don't auto-fix
   - Explain why manual review is needed

**Reference files structure**:
- `REFERENCE.md`: Core style guide and complete word list
- `REFERENCE-EMAIL.md`: Broadcast email standards
- `REFERENCE-KB.md`: Knowledge base article guidelines
- `REFERENCE-WEB-INTERNAL.md`: Website and internal communications
- `governance/`: Complete source files (38 files) for deep reference

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Review content before publication (emails, KB articles, web pages, documentation)
- Ensure compliance with HMS IT governance standards
- Check for style guide violations or inconsistencies
- Validate word usage against the official word list
- Perform quality assurance on communications
- Get editorial feedback on drafts

**Trigger phrases**: "review this content", "check against style guide", "validate governance", "content quality check", "editorial review", "style compliance"

## Content Types Supported

The skill adapts its review criteria based on content type:

1. **Broadcast emails**: Subject lines, messaging architecture, unplanned outage format
2. **Knowledge base articles**: Article type validation, evergreen content, metadata
3. **Website pages**: Page-specific guidelines, strategic initiative content
4. **Internal communications**: Intranet/SharePoint, Teams, policy documents
5. **General documentation**: Core style guide and word list compliance

## Review Modes

The skill offers flexible review depth based on user needs:

### Quick Scan
- Focuses on critical issues only
- Checks voice/tone problems, major word list violations, and serious formatting errors
- Ideal for rapid quality checks before publication
- Typical output: 5-15 high-priority findings

### Comprehensive Review
- Line-by-line analysis covering all governance standards
- Identifies critical, important, and minor issues
- Provides severity ratings and context for each finding
- Typical output: 20-100+ findings depending on content length

### Targeted Review
- Focuses on user-specified areas (e.g., just word usage, just formatting)
- Useful when specific concerns exist or time is limited
- User can request focus on: Voice/Tone, Word Usage, Formatting, Structure, or Platform-Specific

**Default behavior**: The skill automatically selects the appropriate review mode based on user request. For example:
- "Quick check" → Quick Scan
- "Full review" → Comprehensive Review
- "Check the word list" → Targeted Review (Word Usage)

## Workflow

### 1. Content Ingestion
- User provides file path or content to review
- Skill reads and analyzes content structure

### 2. Content Type Detection
- Automatically detects content type from:
  - File path patterns (e.g., `/emails/`, `/kb/`, `/web/`)
  - Content structure (subject lines, article metadata)
  - Explicit user specification

### 3. Review Execution
- Applies appropriate governance rules based on content type
- Checks against multiple dimensions:
  - **Voice and Tone**: Professional voice, appropriate formality, positive language
  - **Word Usage**: Word list compliance, terminology accuracy, inclusive language
  - **Formatting**: Capitalization, monospace/bold/italics usage, dates/times
  - **Structure**: Paragraph length, heading quality, list formatting
  - **Platform-Specific**: Email subject lines, KB article types, metadata

### 4. Present Findings
Findings are organized by:
- **Category**: Voice/Tone, Word Usage, Formatting, Structure, Platform-Specific
- **Severity**: Critical (affects meaning/professionalism) → Important (consistency) → Minor (polish)
- **Location**: Line numbers and context
- **Recommendation**: Specific fix suggestions with examples

### 5. Batch Fix Capability
After presenting findings, the skill offers to automatically fix issues:

**Auto-fixable issues** (can be batched):
- Word list replacements (e.g., "PC" → "computer", "click" → "select")
- Capitalization corrections (sentence case in headings, proper acronym casing)
- Formatting fixes (straight quotes instead of curly quotes, proper date/time format)
- Simple structure improvements (Oxford comma insertion, spacing corrections)

**Manual review required**:
- Voice and tone adjustments (requires judgment and context)
- Complex sentence rewrites (clarity, conciseness)
- Content reorganization (paragraph restructuring, heading improvements)
- Context-dependent word choices

**Batch fix process**:
1. Skill identifies all auto-fixable issues
2. Presents complete list of proposed changes with before/after examples
3. Requests single user approval for batch execution
4. Applies all approved fixes
5. Reports summary of changes made

**When AskUserQuestion is used**:
The skill uses `AskUserQuestion` **only when ambiguity exists during the fix process**, such as:
- Multiple valid fix options (e.g., "either/or" → "either and or" vs "either...or" vs rewording)
- Context-dependent choices (e.g., when "application" might be appropriate vs "app")
- Uncertain content type detection (e.g., could be both email and KB article)

The skill does **not** use `AskUserQuestion` for basic review scope selection if the user's request is clear.

## Finding Categories and Severity Levels

### Voice and Tone
**Critical**:
- Humor or unprofessional language
- Unnecessarily negative framing
- Rhetorical questions instead of statements
- Inappropriate use of "please" or "thank you" (implying optional steps)

**Important**:
- Passive voice where active is clearer
- Future tense instead of present tense/imperative
- Lack of empathy or unhelpful tone

**Minor**:
- Overly formal or stuffy phrasing
- Opportunities to be more direct

### Word Usage
**Critical**:
- Insensitive or non-inclusive terms (blacklist, master/slave, crazy, dummy)
- Incorrect product names or major terminology errors
- Jargon without definition

**Important**:
- Word list violations (PC, click, application vs app)
- Inconsistent terminology
- Latin abbreviations (e.g., i.e., etc.)

**Minor**:
- Unnecessary modifiers (absolutely, actually, basically)
- Roundabout expressions that could be condensed
- Minor redundancies

### Formatting
**Critical**:
- Title case in headings instead of sentence case
- Missing monospace for code, file paths, or commands
- Incorrect bold/italics usage that affects meaning

**Important**:
- Curly quotes instead of straight quotes
- Incorrect date/time format
- Improper acronym capitalization (2fa vs 2FA, vpn vs VPN)

**Minor**:
- Inconsistent spacing

- Minor punctuation issues

### Structure
**Critical**:
- Vague or non-descriptive headings
- Tables used for layout instead of tabular data
- Missing heading structure in long content

**Important**:
- Paragraphs longer than 6 sentences
- Lists where prose would be better (or vice versa)
- Non-parallel phrasing in lists or headings

**Minor**:
- Introductory material could be shorter
- Opportunities for better section breaks

### Platform-Specific
**Critical** (Email):
- Vague or non-action-oriented subject line
- Missing required elements (e.g., time zones in outage notifications)

**Critical** (Knowledge Base):
- Temporal/non-evergreen content (e.g., "next month", "recently")
- Incorrect article type classification

**Important**:

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Quick Scan**: For time-sensitive reviews, start with Quick Scan to catch critical issues
2. **Comprehensive for publication**: Use Comprehensive Review before final publication
3. **Targeted for specific concerns**: If you know the area of concern, request Targeted Review
4. **Review auto-fixes**: Always review the batch fix list before approving
5. **Manual fixes for voice/tone**: Accept that voice and tone improvements require manual review
6. **Iterative improvement**: Use the skill multiple times as content evolves

## Limitations

- **Context limitations**: The skill cannot fully understand domain-specific context or strategic communication goals
- **Judgment calls**: Some style decisions involve judgment that requires human expertise
- **Content quality**: The skill checks compliance, not overall content quality, accuracy, or completeness
- **Platform features**: Platform-specific features (like SharePoint metadata) may not be fully detectable from markdown
- **Updates lag**: Governance updates must be manually incorporated into the skill

## Technical Notes

- **Line number accuracy**: Line numbers refer to the file as read; editing may shift subsequent line numbers
- **Pattern matching**: Word list checking uses exact and contextual pattern matching
- **Severity algorithm**: Severity is determined by impact on meaning, professionalism, and user experience
- **Batch fix safety**: Only deterministic, safe fixes are included in batch operations
