# Creating Agent Skills

Creates or improves Agent Skills following official Claude Code documentation and best practices.

## What you should do

When invoked, help the user create or improve Agent Skills by:

1. **Understanding the goal** - Determine what the user needs:
   - Create a new skill from scratch
   - Improve an existing skill's discovery or structure
   - Evaluate a skill against best practices
   - Convert informal knowledge into a skill
   - Debug why a skill isn't being discovered

2. **Apply best practices** - Follow the official patterns:
   - Use gerund form naming ("Managing X", "Building Y", "Processing Z")
   - Write third-person descriptions with specific trigger words
   - Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines (use progressive disclosure if needed)
   - Include both what the skill does and when to use it
   - Be concise (assume Claude is already smart)

3. **Structure properly** - Ensure correct format:
   - Directory: `skill-name/SKILL.md`
   - YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
   - Clear sections and examples
   - Reference files for detailed content (if needed)

4. **Test and iterate** - Validate the skill works:
   - Check description triggers skill discovery
   - Verify structure is valid
   - Test with real scenarios
   - Iterate based on usage

## Skill structure requirements

### YAML frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: Skill Name (64 chars max, use gerund form)
description: What it does and when to use it (1024 chars max, third person)
---
```

### Naming conventions

**Use gerund form** (verb + -ing):

**Good**: "Processing PDFs", "Analyzing Spreadsheets", "Managing Databases"

**Avoid**: "Helper", "Utils", "Tools", "Documents", "Data"

### Writing effective descriptions

**Always write in third person**:

- ✅ "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
- ❌ "I can help you process Excel files"
- ❌ "You can use this to process Excel files"

**Include both what and when**:

```yaml
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills forms, merges documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Be specific** - include key trigger words that users would mention.

### Progressive disclosure

Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Move detailed content to separate files:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Overview and navigation
├── REFERENCE.md          # Detailed API docs
├── EXAMPLES.md           # Usage examples
└── scripts/
    └── helper.py         # Utility scripts
```

Reference from SKILL.md:

```markdown
**Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
**API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
```

Claude loads additional files only when needed.

## Quick skill creation workflow

When user asks to create a skill:

1. **Understand the domain**:
   - What tasks will this skill help with?
   - What context or knowledge needs to be captured?
   - What are the common patterns or workflows?

2. **Draft the structure**:

```yaml
---
name: [Gerund form name]
description: [Third person, what + when, specific triggers]
---

# [Skill Title]

[Brief overview]

## What you should do

[Step-by-step instructions for Claude]

## [Section 2: Domain-specific content]

[Examples, patterns, or references]
```

3. **Keep it concise**:
   - Challenge every paragraph: "Does Claude really need this?"
   - Remove explanations of common knowledge
   - Focus on domain-specific information

4. **Add progressive disclosure** (if needed):
   - Move detailed reference to separate files
   - Keep SKILL.md as navigation guide
   - Link to details: "See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)"

5. **Test discovery**:
   - Does the description trigger the skill when relevant?
   - Test with fresh Claude instance
   - Iterate based on actual usage

## Checklist for effective skills

Before finalizing a skill:

### Core quality
- [ ] Description uses third person voice
- [ ] Description includes both what and when
- [ ] Description has specific trigger keywords
- [ ] Name uses gerund form
- [ ] SKILL.md body under 500 lines
- [ ] No time-sensitive information
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Concrete examples (not abstract)
- [ ] File references one level deep
- [ ] Forward slashes in all paths (not backslashes)

### Testing
- [ ] Tested with real usage scenarios
- [ ] Description triggers skill appropriately
- [ ] Structure follows official format

## Common patterns by skill type

### Data analysis skills
**Pattern**: Domain-specific schemas + common queries + filters

Example: BigQuery with table schemas, naming conventions, filtering rules

### Document processing skills
**Pattern**: Workflows + validation + utility scripts

Example: PDF form filling with analyze → map → validate → fill

### Code generation skills
**Pattern**: Templates + examples + style guide

Example: Commit messages with format + examples

### Configuration skills
**Pattern**: Project-specific settings + references

Example: GitHub Projects with pre-configured IDs and field options

## Output format

When creating a skill, provide:

1. **Complete SKILL.md content** with proper frontmatter
2. **File structure** showing any additional reference files
3. **Testing suggestions** - scenarios to verify discovery
4. **Usage examples** - how to invoke naturally

Example output:

```
I'll create a skill for [domain]. Here's the structure:

```yaml
---
name: [Gerund form name]
description: [Third person, what + when, specific triggers]
---

# [Skill Title]

[Content following best practices...]
```

**File structure**:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
└── REFERENCE.md (if needed)
```

**Testing**:
Try these scenarios to verify discovery:
- "[Natural request that should trigger]"
- "[Another scenario]"
```

## Best practices reference

For complete best practices including:
- Degrees of freedom
- Content guidelines
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Evaluation strategies
- Common skill types
- Detailed examples

See [BEST-PRACTICES.md](BEST-PRACTICES.md)

## Remember

- Skills are **model-invoked** - Claude decides when to use them
- Good descriptions are critical for discovery
- Conciseness preserves context window
- Test with real usage, not just theory
- Iterate based on observed behavior
