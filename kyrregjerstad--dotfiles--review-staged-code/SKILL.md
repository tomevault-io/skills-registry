# Review Staged Code

Review Git staged changes for quality, correctness, and style compliance.

## Process

1. **Assess staged changes**
   ```bash
   git diff --cached --stat
   ```
   If no staged changes, inform user and stop.

   If diff is large (>1000 lines or >10 files):
   - Review file-by-file instead of all at once
   - Skip generated files (*.lock, *.gen.ts, dist/, node_modules, etc.)
   - Prioritize: core logic → tests → types → config
   - Maintain a running summary across file reviews

   For normal-sized diffs, get the full diff:
   ```bash
   git diff --cached
   ```

2. **Read project style guide**
   Check for CLAUDE.md in repo root. If present, read and apply its conventions.

3. **Load relevant project documentation**
   Check for `./docs/` directory. If present:
   - List available docs to understand what's documented
   - Based on the staged changes, identify which docs are relevant:
     - Changed a React component? Read UI/component docs
     - Changed API routes? Read API docs
     - Changed database code? Read data model docs
   - Only load docs that directly relate to the code being reviewed
   - Skip unrelated docs (e.g., don't read Kubernetes docs when reviewing React code)

4. **Understand the surrounding context**
   Before reviewing, gather context on how the changed code connects to the system:
   - Read the full files being modified (not just the diff hunks)
   - Find callers/consumers of modified functions/components
   - Check what the modified code calls or depends on
   - Look at related tests if they exist
   - Understand the data flow and state management around the changes

   This prevents surface-level reviews that miss integration issues.

5. **Review the code** examining:

   **Correctness**
   - Logic errors, off-by-one, null/undefined handling
   - Race conditions, async/await issues
   - Edge cases not handled

   **Security**
   - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, XSS)
   - Hardcoded secrets, credentials
   - Unsafe deserialization, eval usage

   **Best Practices**
   - DRY violations, dead code
   - Proper error handling
   - Meaningful names, clear intent
   - Appropriate abstractions (not over/under-engineered)

   **Style Guide Compliance**
   - Follow CLAUDE.md conventions if present
   - Consistent formatting, naming conventions
   - Import organization

   **Performance**
   - Unnecessary re-renders (React)
   - N+1 queries, missing indexes
   - Memory leaks, unbounded growth

   **Integration**
   - Breaking changes to public APIs or interfaces
   - Mismatched assumptions with callers/consumers
   - Missing updates to related code that should change together
   - State management inconsistencies
   - Type mismatches at boundaries

6. **Report findings**

   Format:
   ```
   ## Summary
   [1-2 sentence overview]

   ## Issues Found

   ### Critical
   1. **file:line** - Description and fix
   2. **file:line** - Description and fix

   ### Warnings
   3. **file:line** - Description and suggestion
   4. **file:line** - Description and suggestion

   ### Suggestions
   5. **file:line** - Optional improvement

   ## What Looks Good
   [Brief positive notes if applicable]
   ```

   Use continuous numbering across all sections for easy reference (e.g., "fix issue #3").

   If no issues: "Staged changes look good. No issues found."

## Guidelines

- Be specific: reference exact file and line numbers from the diff
- Explain WHY something is an issue, not just WHAT
- Provide concrete fix suggestions
- Distinguish severity: critical (must fix) vs warnings vs suggestions
- Don't nitpick style if no style guide exists
- Focus on the actual changes, not surrounding unchanged code
- Use context7 MCP server to look up latest library docs when unsure about correct API usage, best practices, or deprecations
- Use sub-agents (Task tool) liberally for parallel work: exploring callers/consumers, searching for patterns, reading related files, checking test coverage
