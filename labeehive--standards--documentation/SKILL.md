# Documentation Skill

Write and review documentation following Labee standards.

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity over completeness** - Write what is necessary, no more
2. **Consistent structure** - Follow established patterns
3. **Actionable content** - Every document should help readers accomplish something

## When Invoked

### Step 1: Identify Task Type

- **Writing new docs?** → Go to Step 2a
- **Reviewing existing?** → Go to Step 2b
- **Formatting questions?** → Load markdown-formatting.md directly

### Step 2a: Writing New Documentation

1. Load `references/content-types.md` to choose document type
2. Load `references/document-structure.md` for structure template
3. Apply writing principles from `_core-rules.md` (auto-loaded)
4. Draft document following templates

### Step 2b: Reviewing Documentation

1. `_core-rules.md` is auto-loaded with core rules
2. Check against rules, noting specific issues with line numbers

### Step 3: Provide Output

**For writing:** Provide draft following templates
**For review:** List specific issues with:
- Line number
- Issue description
- Suggested fix
