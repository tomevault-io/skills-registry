# Feature Research Skill

## Purpose

Guide interactive research and understanding of features through conversation, documentation consultation, and selective proof-of-concept (POC) creation. This skill transforms feature ideas into well-understood, documented technical specifications ready for implementation planning.

**Note:** This skill focuses on TECHNICAL research (HOW to implement). For requirement clarification (WHAT to implement), use `feature-specification` first.

## Input

This skill can receive:
- **CDC.md** (from `feature-specification`) - Provides clear, validated requirements to guide research
- **Direct feature request** - If requirements are already clear

When CDC.md exists, use it as the source of truth for requirements and focus research on technical implementation.

## IMPORTANT: User Interaction

**ALWAYS use the `AskUserQuestion` tool when asking clarifying questions.**

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "Should we create a POC to validate this approach?"
      header: "POC"
      options:
        - label: "Yes, create POC"
          description: "Validate technical feasibility before proceeding"
        - label: "No, skip POC"
          description: "Documentation is sufficient, proceed to planning"
      multiSelect: false
```

This ensures:
- Clear, structured questions
- User can choose from options or provide custom response
- Conversation stays focused on technical decisions

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- CDC.md is ready and technical research is needed
- Starting a new feature implementation with clear requirements
- Researching design patterns or architectural approaches for a feature
- Needing to understand how a feature integrates with existing codebase
- Consulting up-to-date documentation for frameworks, libraries, or APIs
- Validating technical feasibility through minimal POCs
- Gathering information before creating an implementation plan

## Research Workflow

### Phase 1: Understand the Feature Request

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Read the feature request carefully
   - Identify key requirements and constraints
   - List unknowns and areas requiring research

2. **Interactive Questioning**
   - Ask clarifying questions to the user
   - Understand the "why" behind the feature
   - Identify expected behavior and edge cases
   - Determine acceptance criteria

**Example Questions:**
- What problem does this feature solve?
- Who are the end users of this feature?
- What are the expected inputs and outputs?
- Are there performance or scalability requirements?
- Are there security or compliance considerations?

### Phase 2: Codebase Integration Research

1. **Analyze Existing Architecture**
   - Use Glob to find relevant files and patterns
   - Use Grep to search for similar implementations
   - Use Read to understand integration points
   - Identify existing patterns and conventions

2. **Identify Integration Points**
   - Where does this feature fit in the architecture?
   - What existing components will be affected?
   - What new components need to be created?
   - How will data flow through the system?

**Search Strategy:**
```bash
# Example searches (adapt to your project)
# Find similar features
grep -r "pattern:similar-feature" src/

# Find integration points
glob "**/*Controller.cs"  # For .NET APIs
glob "**/*Service.ts"     # For TypeScript services

# Understand patterns
read important-file.ts
```

### Phase 3: Documentation and Design Pattern Research

1. **Use MCP Deep Wiki for Accurate Documentation**
   - Consult MCP Deep Wiki for framework/library documentation
   - Search for design patterns applicable to your use case
   - Get up-to-date best practices and examples

**When to Use Deep Wiki:**
- Need framework-specific implementation details
- Want to understand API capabilities
- Looking for recommended design patterns
- Need examples of proper usage

**Deep Wiki Usage Tips:**
- Be specific in queries: "How to implement authentication in FastAPI"
- Ask for code examples: "Show example of React useEffect with cleanup"
- Request best practices: "Best practices for error handling in .NET Web APIs"

2. **Research Design Patterns**
   - Identify applicable design patterns (Repository, Factory, Observer, etc.)
   - Understand trade-offs of different approaches
   - Consider patterns used elsewhere in codebase

See `references/deep-wiki-usage.md` for detailed Deep Wiki guidance.

### Phase 4: Proof of Concept (POC) Creation

**When to Create a POC:**
- Technical feasibility is uncertain
- Need to validate a new library or framework
- Testing integration between components
- Exploring performance characteristics
- User wants to see a working prototype

**When NOT to Create a POC:**
- Feature is straightforward with clear implementation path
- Similar features already exist in codebase
- Documentation provides sufficient clarity
- User explicitly doesn't need a POC

**POC Creation Guidelines:**

1. **Keep It Minimal**
   - Focus on the core concept being validated
   - Don't build production-ready code
   - Use hardcoded data when possible
   - Skip error handling and edge cases

2. **Adaptive to Project Context**
   - If working within existing project: Create POC in a temporary branch or file
   - If starting from scratch: Create minimal standalone project
   - Use tools available in current environment (React, .NET, Python, etc.)

3. **POC Structure**
   ```
   poc-feature-name/
   ├── README.md           # What is being tested and why
   ├── main.* (or app.*)   # Entry point
   └── [minimal files]     # Only what's needed
   ```

4. **Document POC Results**
   - What was validated?
   - What was learned?
   - What issues were discovered?
   - Recommendations for production implementation

See `references/poc-guidelines.md` for detailed POC creation guidance.

### Phase 5: Document Findings

Create a findings document that captures all research results.

**Findings Document Structure:**
```markdown
# Feature Research: [Feature Name]

## Overview
Brief description of the feature

## Requirements
- Key requirement 1
- Key requirement 2
- ...

## Design Decisions
### Chosen Approach
Description and rationale

### Alternatives Considered
- Alternative 1: Pros/Cons
- Alternative 2: Pros/Cons

## Integration Points
- Component A: How it integrates
- Component B: How it integrates

## Technical Considerations
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Scalability concerns

## Dependencies
- External libraries needed
- Internal components required
- API endpoints to create/modify

## POC Results (if applicable)
- What was tested
- Findings
- Recommendations

## References
- Links to Deep Wiki queries
- Relevant documentation
- Similar implementations in codebase

## Next Steps
- Ready for implementation planning
- Additional research needed (if any)
```

See `references/research-template.md` for a complete template.

## Iterative Research Process

Research is iterative. The workflow above may repeat multiple times:

1. **Ask Questions** → **Get Answers** → **Refine Understanding**
2. **Research Docs** → **Find Patterns** → **Adjust Approach**
3. **Build POC** → **Learn from Results** → **Revise Design**

**Don't Rush:** Take time to understand the feature thoroughly. A well-researched feature is faster to implement and has fewer issues.

## Output

The output of this skill is a comprehensive findings document (`findings.md` or `research-notes.md`) that contains:

- Clear understanding of the feature requirements
- Documented design decisions with rationale
- Identified integration points in codebase
- Technical considerations and dependencies
- POC results (if created)
- References to documentation and research
- Clear next steps for implementation planning

This document becomes the input for the `implementation-planner` skill.

## Tips for Effective Research

1. **Ask Before Assuming** - Clarify ambiguities with the user early
2. **Search Before Creating** - Check if similar features exist
3. **Document As You Go** - Capture findings in real-time
4. **Be Thorough** - Better to over-research than under-research
5. **Validate Uncertainty** - Use POCs for technical validation
6. **Think About Integration** - Consider how the feature fits into the system
7. **Use Deep Wiki** - Leverage up-to-date documentation
8. **Communicate** - Keep the user informed throughout the research process

## Example Usage

```
User: "I want to add email notifications when a form is submitted"

Claude (using feature-research skill):
1. "Let me research this feature. A few questions first:
   - Should emails be sent immediately or queued?
   - Are there specific email templates to use?
   - Should we use an external service (SendGrid, etc.) or SMTP?"

2. [Searches codebase for existing email functionality]

3. [Consults Deep Wiki: "How to implement background job queues in .NET"]

4. "I found that we're using Hangfire for background jobs.
   I recommend queuing emails using Hangfire for reliability.
   Should I create a small POC to validate the Microsoft Graph integration?"

5. [Creates minimal POC if user agrees]

6. [Documents findings in findings.md with design decisions,
   integration points, and recommendations]

7. "Research complete! I've documented the approach in findings.md.
   Ready to create the implementation plan?"
```
