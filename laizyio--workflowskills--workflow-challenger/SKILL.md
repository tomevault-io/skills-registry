# Workflow Challenger Skill

## Purpose

Act as a critical reviewer and devil's advocate at any stage of the feature workflow. This skill performs deep analysis to:

- Challenge assumptions and decisions
- Identify gaps and missing specifications
- Surface unanswered questions
- Verify coherence between documents and codebase
- Ensure nothing has been overlooked

**Key principle:** Better to surface issues early than discover them during implementation or testing.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill:

- After completing CDC.md to verify specification completeness
- After research to challenge technical decisions
- After planning to verify plan coherence with requirements
- Before implementation to catch missing details
- After test failures to understand root causes
- Anytime something feels incomplete or uncertain
- When user wants a second opinion on approach

## IMPORTANT: User Interaction

**Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool when clarification is needed on identified gaps.**

After analysis, use AskUserQuestion to:
- Confirm critical issues need resolution
- Get user input on ambiguous findings
- Prioritize which gaps to address first

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "I found that the CDC doesn't address error handling. How should we proceed?"
      header: "Gap Found"
      options:
        - label: "Add to CDC now"
          description: "Update the specification before continuing"
        - label: "Note for later"
          description: "Document as known gap, address during implementation"
        - label: "Not needed"
          description: "This case won't occur in practice"
      multiSelect: false
```

This ensures:
- User is aware of identified issues
- Clear decision-making on how to proceed
- Gaps are explicitly acknowledged or resolved

## Analysis Sources

The challenger analyzes multiple sources to build comprehensive context:

### 1. Project Documentation
```
Look for documentation folders at project root:
- [DOC]-{ProjectName}/
- docs/
- documentation/
- .doc/
- wiki/
```

Read all relevant documentation to understand:
- Project architecture
- Business rules
- Existing conventions
- Historical decisions

### 2. Codebase Analysis
```
Analyze existing code to understand:
- Current implementation patterns
- Data models and schemas
- API contracts
- Service dependencies
- Configuration patterns
```

### 3. Workflow Deliverables
```
Review current workflow documents:
- CDC.md (specification)
- findings.md (research)
- Plan.md (implementation plan)
- test-plan.md (test strategy)
```

### 4. Obsidian/Knowledge Base
```
If Obsidian MCP is available:
- Search for related notes
- Find linked concepts
- Discover historical context
```

## Challenge Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

1. **Identify current stage** - What deliverable is being challenged?
2. **Read the deliverable** - Understand what has been documented
3. **Explore project docs** - Find [DOC]-* folders and read relevant files
4. **Analyze codebase** - Understand existing patterns and constraints
5. **Build mental model** - Synthesize all information

```
Example context gathering:
1. Read CDC.md for "email notifications" feature
2. Found [DOC]-Backend/ with architecture.md
3. Found existing NotificationService in codebase
4. Found EmailTemplate component already exists
5. Mental model: Feature partially exists, CDC doesn't mention this
```

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis

Systematically check for gaps in each category:

**2.1 Missing Requirements**
- Are all user stories covered?
- Are edge cases addressed?
- Are error scenarios defined?
- Are non-functional requirements specified?

**2.2 Unclear Specifications**
- Are there ambiguous terms?
- Are there assumptions not validated?
- Are there "TBD" or placeholder sections?
- Are acceptance criteria measurable?

**2.3 Incoherence Detection**
- Does the document contradict itself?
- Does it contradict project documentation?
- Does it contradict existing codebase?
- Does it contradict other workflow documents?

**2.4 Missing Context**
- Is existing functionality acknowledged?
- Are dependencies identified?
- Are integration points clear?
- Is the scope realistic?

See `references/gap-analysis-guide.md` for detailed checklist.

### Phase 3: Challenge Formulation

For each identified issue, formulate a clear challenge:

**Structure:**
```
## Challenge: [Title]

**Type:** Gap / Ambiguity / Incoherence / Missing Context
**Severity:** Critical / Major / Minor
**Location:** [Document section or code location]

**Observation:**
[What was found or missing]

**Question:**
[Specific question to resolve the issue]

**Recommendation:**
[Suggested resolution or investigation]
```

**Example:**
```
## Challenge: Existing Email System Not Addressed

**Type:** Missing Context
**Severity:** Critical
**Location:** CDC.md Section 4 (Functional Requirements)

**Observation:**
The CDC specifies creating an EmailService, but the codebase already
has `src/services/NotificationService.ts` with email capabilities.
The CDC doesn't mention whether to extend, replace, or ignore it.

**Question:**
Should we extend the existing NotificationService or create a
separate EmailService? What happens to existing email functionality?

**Recommendation:**
Update CDC to explicitly address the existing NotificationService.
Consider extending it rather than creating parallel functionality.
```

### Phase 4: Coherence Verification

Cross-check between documents and reality:

**CDC vs Codebase:**
- Are referenced components real?
- Do proposed integrations make sense?
- Are technology choices consistent?

**CDC vs Project Docs:**
- Does it follow documented architecture?
- Does it respect documented constraints?
- Is terminology consistent?

**Findings vs CDC:**
- Does research address all CDC requirements?
- Are POC results aligned with specifications?
- Are chosen patterns appropriate?

**Plan vs Findings:**
- Does plan implement research recommendations?
- Are dependencies correctly sequenced?
- Is scope consistent?

### Phase 5: Report Generation

Compile findings into a structured report:

```markdown
# Challenge Report: [Deliverable Name]

**Date:** [Date]
**Stage:** [Specification / Research / Planning / etc.]
**Challenger:** Claude Code

## Summary

[Brief overview of findings]

- **Critical Issues:** X
- **Major Issues:** X
- **Minor Issues:** X

## Critical Issues

[Must be resolved before proceeding]

## Major Issues

[Should be resolved, but not blocking]

## Minor Issues

[Nice to address, low impact]

## Coherence Check

| Source A | Source B | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| CDC | Codebase | ⚠️ | [Issue] |
| CDC | Project Docs | ✅ | Aligned |

## Questions for User

1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]

## Recommendations

1. [Recommendation 1]
2. [Recommendation 2]

## Conclusion

[Overall assessment and suggested next steps]
```

## Challenge by Stage

### Challenging CDC.md (Specification)

Focus on:
- Requirement completeness
- Scope clarity
- Acceptance criteria measurability
- Alignment with project architecture
- Existing functionality conflicts

Key questions:
- "Is this already partially implemented?"
- "Does this conflict with existing features?"
- "Are all personas addressed?"
- "What happens in failure scenarios?"

### Challenging findings.md (Research)

Focus on:
- Technical decision rationale
- Alternative evaluation completeness
- POC validity
- Integration feasibility
- Risk identification

Key questions:
- "Why this approach over alternatives?"
- "Was the POC representative?"
- "Are performance implications understood?"
- "What could go wrong?"

### Challenging Plan.md (Implementation)

Focus on:
- Step granularity appropriateness
- Dependency correctness
- Parallelization opportunities
- Missing steps
- Validation criteria clarity

Key questions:
- "Is this step too vague to implement?"
- "What if step X fails?"
- "Can these steps run in parallel?"
- "How do we know this step is complete?"

### Challenging test-plan.md (Testing)

Focus on:
- Coverage completeness
- Test priority appropriateness
- Edge case coverage
- Performance test inclusion
- Realistic test scenarios

Key questions:
- "Are negative scenarios tested?"
- "Is this test redundant with another?"
- "What's the most likely failure mode?"
- "Are integration points tested?"

## Context Discovery Patterns

### Finding Project Documentation

```bash
# Common documentation locations
Glob: [DOC]-*/**/*.md
Glob: docs/**/*.md
Glob: documentation/**/*.md
Glob: *.md (root level)
Glob: .github/**/*.md
```

### Finding Related Code

```bash
# Based on feature name/domain
Grep: "feature-keyword"
Glob: **/*Service*.ts
Glob: **/*Controller*.cs
Glob: **/models/**/*
```

### Using Obsidian MCP

```
If Obsidian available:
- Search notes for feature keywords
- Find linked architecture decisions
- Discover related past implementations
```

## Challenge Intensity Levels

### Quick Review (5-10 min)
- Scan document structure
- Check for obvious gaps
- Verify key sections present
- Spot-check coherence

### Standard Review (15-30 min)
- Full document read
- Cross-reference with codebase
- Check project documentation
- Formulate key questions

### Deep Review (30-60 min)
- Comprehensive analysis
- Full codebase exploration
- All documentation reviewed
- Detailed challenge report

## Tips for Effective Challenging

1. **Be constructive** - Goal is improvement, not criticism
2. **Be specific** - Vague concerns aren't actionable
3. **Prioritize** - Focus on critical issues first
4. **Suggest solutions** - Don't just identify problems
5. **Consider context** - Time/resource constraints matter
6. **Trust but verify** - Check claims against reality
7. **Document findings** - Create actionable report
8. **Ask, don't assume** - Formulate questions when uncertain

## Integration with Workflow

The challenger can be invoked:

- **Explicitly:** User requests challenge review
- **At transitions:** Between workflow phases
- **On demand:** Anytime during development

```
Phase 0: Specification → [Challenge CDC] → Phase 1: Research
Phase 1: Research → [Challenge Findings] → Phase 2: Planning
Phase 2: Planning → [Challenge Plan] → Phase 3: Implementation
...
```
