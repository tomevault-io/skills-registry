# CodeRabbit CLI

Use CodeRabbit CLI to perform structured, automated code review and iterative improvement, enabling AI agents to write, review, and refine code in a tight feedback loop.

## Prerequisites

- CodeRabbit CLI installed: `npm install -g @coderabbitai/cli` or see [docs.coderabbit.ai](https://docs.coderabbit.ai)
- Authenticated: `coderabbit auth login` (one-time setup)
- Git repository: Run commands from within a git repository. CodeRabbit reviews: unstaged working-tree changes, staged-but-uncommitted changes, and local commits not yet pushed. Does not run on a clean working tree with no local changes.
- Repository context: CodeRabbit needs access to repository metadata (can be configured via `.coderabbit.yaml`)

## Quick Start

**Run review on current changes:**
```bash
coderabbit review --plain
```

**Get token-efficient summary:**
```bash
coderabbit review --prompt-only
```

**Limit scope to local changes:**
```bash
coderabbit review --plain --type uncommitted
```

**Limit scope by base branch or commit:**
```bash
coderabbit review --plain --base main
```

## AI Agent Review Workflow

### 1. Implement Code

Write the requested code or changes following project conventions and requirements.

### 2. Run CodeRabbit Review

Choose the appropriate review mode based on context:

**Detailed feedback mode** (recommended for active development):
```bash
coderabbit review --plain
```

**Token-efficient mode** (for tight token budgets):
```bash
coderabbit review --prompt-only
```

**Limit scope** (when focusing on particular changes):
- Use `--type uncommitted` to review only local changes
- Use `--base` or `--base-commit` to compare against a specific baseline

### 3. Analyze Feedback

CodeRabbit provides feedback in several categories:

- **Correctness issues**: Bugs, logic errors, type safety problems
- **Readability improvements**: Code clarity, naming, structure
- **Maintainability suggestions**: Best practices, patterns, technical debt
- **Security concerns**: Vulnerabilities, unsafe patterns
- **Performance optimizations**: Efficiency improvements

**Key principles for analyzing feedback:**
- Treat CodeRabbit as a senior reviewer: reason about suggestions, don't blindly apply them
- Prioritize correctness and security issues first
- Consider maintainability and readability improvements
- Evaluate performance suggestions in context of actual requirements
- Some suggestions may be stylistic or context-dependent

### 4. Revise Code

Apply meaningful improvements based on CodeRabbit's feedback:

- Fix correctness issues immediately
- Address security concerns
- Improve readability where it adds value
- Apply maintainability suggestions that align with project patterns
- Consider performance optimizations if they're relevant

**Document rationale** for significant changes or when choosing not to apply suggestions.

### 5. Re-review (Optional)

For significant changes or when addressing critical issues, re-run CodeRabbit to validate improvements:

```bash
coderabbit review --plain
```

This creates an iterative improvement loop until code quality meets standards.

## Usage Patterns

### After Feature Implementation

When implementing new features:

1. Complete the feature implementation
2. Run `coderabbit review --plain` for comprehensive feedback
3. Address critical and major issues
4. Re-review if significant changes were made
5. Proceed with submission when quality gates pass

### Before PR Submission

When preparing code for human review:

1. Stage all changes: `git add .`
2. Run `coderabbit review --plain` to catch issues early
3. Fix all actionable feedback
4. Re-run review to confirm fixes
5. Submit PR with confidence that basic quality checks pass

### Exploring Unfamiliar Domains

When working with new languages, frameworks, or patterns:

1. Implement initial solution
2. Run `coderabbit review --plain` to learn best practices
3. Study feedback to understand domain conventions
4. Revise code applying learned patterns
5. Use as learning tool to understand idiomatic code

### Refactoring Existing Code

When improving existing code:

1. Make refactoring changes
2. Run `coderabbit review --plain` to ensure no regressions
3. Verify feedback aligns with refactoring goals
4. Address any new issues introduced
5. Confirm code quality improved or maintained

## Command Reference

### Basic Review Commands

**Review all uncommitted changes:**
```bash
coderabbit review
```

**Plain text output (detailed):**
```bash
coderabbit review --plain
```

**Prompt-only output (token-efficient):**
```bash
coderabbit review --prompt-only
```

**Review only uncommitted changes:**
```bash
coderabbit review --type uncommitted
```

**Review changes against a base:**
```bash
coderabbit review --base main
```

**Review staged changes:**

```bash
git add .
coderabbit review
```

CodeRabbit automatically detects and reviews staged changes when they exist. The `coderabbit review` command will review all uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) by default.

> Note: the current CodeRabbit CLI does not support a `--files` option. To limit scope (or avoid file-count limits), rely on `--type`, `--base`, or `--base-commit`, or use git to stage only the changes you want reviewed.

### Authentication

**Login to CodeRabbit:**
```bash
coderabbit auth login
```

**Check authentication status:**
```bash
coderabbit auth status
```

### Configuration

CodeRabbit can be configured via `.coderabbit.yaml` in the repository root:

```yaml
language: "en-US"

reviews:
  review_status: false  # Suppress auto-generated status comments
  pre_merge_checks:
    docstrings:
      mode: "off"  # Disable docstring coverage checks
```

See [CodeRabbit Configuration](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/configuration) for full options.

## Integration with Development Workflow

### With Git Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Stage changes: `git add .`
3. Run CodeRabbit review
4. Fix issues
5. Commit with confidence: `git commit -m "feat: implement feature"`
6. Push and create PR

### With AI Agent Workflows

1. Agent implements code based on requirements
2. Agent runs `coderabbit review --plain`
3. Agent analyzes feedback and identifies actionable issues
4. Agent revises code addressing feedback
5. Agent optionally re-runs review to validate fixes
6. Agent documents changes and rationale
7. Agent proceeds with next steps (tests, documentation, etc.)

## Quality Bar

When using CodeRabbit in an agent workflow:

- **Address correctness issues**: All bugs and logic errors must be fixed
- **Consider security concerns**: Security issues should be addressed or documented
- **Evaluate maintainability**: Apply suggestions that align with project patterns
- **Reason about feedback**: Don't blindly apply all suggestions; understand intent
- **Document decisions**: When choosing not to apply suggestions, note rationale

## When Not to Use

- **Trivial changes**: Typos, formatting-only edits, simple renames
- **Rapid prototyping**: When speed is more important than quality
- **Repository not initialized**: CodeRabbit needs git context
- **No local changes**: Nothing to review if working tree is clean (no unstaged, staged, or uncommitted local changes)

## Best Practices

### Token Management

- Use `--prompt-only` when operating under tight token budgets
- Use `--plain` during active development for detailed feedback
- Focus on actionable feedback rather than reading all suggestions

### Feedback Analysis

- Prioritize critical and major issues
- Group similar suggestions for efficient addressing
- Consider context when evaluating stylistic suggestions
- Some suggestions may conflict with project conventions

### Iterative Improvement

- Don't try to address all feedback in one pass
- Focus on correctness and security first
- Re-review after significant changes
- Use feedback as learning opportunity
