# PR Review Integration

Review pull requests by integrating GitHub operations with Linear issue tracking. Validate code changes against project requirements and provide comprehensive reviews.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Linear MCP server configured and available
- Access to both GitHub repository and Linear workspace

## Complete PR Review Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Context from PR

Get PR details:
```bash
gh pr view <pr-number> --json title,body,author,state,baseRefName,headRefName
```

Get changed files:
```bash
gh pr view <pr-number> --json files --jq '.files[].path'
```

Get PR diff:
```bash
gh pr diff <pr-number>
```

Extract Linear issue references:
```bash
gh pr view <pr-number> --json body --jq '.body' | grep -oE 'LIN-[0-9]+'
```

### Step 2: Fetch Linear Issue Requirements

Get issue details:
```typescript
mcp_Linear_get_issue({
  id: "LIN-123", // extracted from PR
  includeRelations: true // get related/blocking issues
})
```

Extract requirements from issue:
- Parse issue `description` for acceptance criteria
- Check `labels` for feature tags
- Review `comments` for additional context
- Check `relatedTo` and `blocks` for dependencies

### Step 3: Analyze PR Changes

Review code changes:
```bash
gh pr diff <pr-number>
gh pr diff <pr-number> -- path/to/file
gh pr view <pr-number> --json files --jq '.files[] | "\(.path): +\(.additions) -\(.deletions)"'
```

Check PR status:
```bash
gh pr checks <pr-number>
gh pr view <pr-number> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus
```

### Step 4: Validate Against Requirements

Compare PR changes to issue requirements:

1. **Check Feature Completeness:**
   - Does PR implement all acceptance criteria?
   - Are all required features present?
   - Are edge cases handled?

2. **Check Code Quality:**
   - Follows project standards (AGENTS.md, Cursor rules)
   - Proper error handling
   - Tests included (if required)
   - Documentation updated

3. **Check Dependencies:**
   - Related issues addressed?
   - Blocking issues resolved?
   - Integration points considered?

4. **Identify Gaps:**
   - Missing requirements
   - Incomplete implementations
   - Additional work needed

### Step 5: Document Review Findings

**Option A: GitHub PR Comment**
```bash
gh pr comment <pr-number> --body "
## PR Review Summary

### ✅ Requirements Met
- [Requirement 1] - Implemented in [file]
- [Requirement 2] - Complete

### ⚠️ Gaps Identified
- [Gap 1] - Missing from issue LIN-123
- [Gap 2] - Needs additional work

### 📝 Code Quality
- Follows project standards
- [Additional notes]

### 🔗 Related Issues
- LIN-123 (main issue)
- LIN-124 (related)
"
```

**Option B: Linear Issue Comment**
```typescript
mcp_Linear_create_comment({
  issueId: "LIN-123",
  body: `
## PR Review: #${prNumber}

### Status: ${reviewStatus}

### Requirements Coverage
${requirementsChecklist}

### Code Quality
${qualityNotes}

### Next Steps
${nextSteps}
  `
})
```

**Option C: Update Linear Issue**
```typescript
mcp_Linear_update_issue({
  id: "LIN-123",
  state: "In Review", // or appropriate status
})
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always link PRs to Linear issues** for traceability
2. **Extract issue IDs early** to fetch requirements
3. **Validate against requirements first**, then code quality
4. **Document gaps clearly** with specific file/line references
5. **Update Linear issues** with review findings
6. **Use consistent review format** for readability
7. **Handle edge cases gracefully** (no issue, multiple issues, etc.)
