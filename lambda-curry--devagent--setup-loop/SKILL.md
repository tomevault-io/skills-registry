# Setup Loop (Ralph)

Set up a Ralph execution loop in Beads by converting a DevAgent plan into an epic + tasks with correct fields, dependencies, and routing labels. This skill is focused on **Beads setup and routing correctness**; the workflow defines the step-by-step process.

## When to Use
- After a plan is drafted/approved and before `start-ralph-execution`.
- When you need correct Beads metadata so Ralph can route tasks to agents reliably.

## Inputs
- Plan path (DevAgent plan markdown)
- Beads prefix (from `bd config get issue_prefix`)
- Ralph config mapping (`.devagent/plugins/ralph/tools/config.json`)

## Core Principles
- **Routing depends on labels.** Every direct epic child must have exactly one routing label from the config mapping.
- **Dependencies are edges, not fields.** You can add them after creation with `bd dep add` (default blocking edge). `bd update` cannot add deps.
- **Traceability is mandatory.** Always include the plan path in epic description and task notes.
- **Manual extraction by default.** Avoid ad-hoc parsing scripts unless explicitly requested.
- **Resumable beats "one big command".** Always use an idempotent, stepwise approach: create issues individually first, then link dependencies in a second pass. This avoids brittleness from timeouts, partial execution, or environment differences.
- **Early visibility.** For plans involving code changes, consider a first `project-manager` task to create a draft PR with a progress tracker—this surfaces work-in-progress early so reviewers can see commits as the loop progresses.
- **Role checkpoints.** Consider the natural flow of work across roles when structuring tasks. Any role can appear multiple times if complexity warrants it:
  - **PM**: Setup and closeout. The initial PM task should validate the loop is ready to run: correct base branch, task dependencies make sense, roles are assigned, acceptance criteria are clear. Also create draft PR with progress tracker. For complex epics, consider mid-loop progress checks between major phases.
  - **Design**: For UI work, review specs/mockups before engineering begins. For iterative UI, add checkpoints to review intermediate work before engineering continues.
  - **Engineering**: Implementation and tests. Can be split across foundation, features, and refinements.
  - **QA**: Verify outcomes match expectations; reopen tasks if they don't. For multi-phase work, consider QA after each major milestone rather than only at the end.

## Beads Field Mapping (Plan → Beads)

### Epic (Parent Task)
- **Title:** Plan title from `# <Task Name> Plan`
- **Description:** Must include:
  - `Plan document: <absolute-path>`
  - `Final Deliverable: <Summary or Functional Narrative>`
  - `Final Quality Gates: <detected commands>`

### Tasks (Direct Epic Children)
- **Description:** Combine objective + impacted files + references + testing criteria.
- **Design:** Capture constraints, patterns, and relevant rules (RR7, Storybook, etc.).
- **Notes:** Always include plan path and any warnings/risks.
- **Acceptance:** Semicolon-separated list from plan acceptance criteria.

### Subtasks (Optional)
- Only if the plan explicitly includes them; otherwise skip.
- Leave unlabeled unless you want separate routing.

## Routing Labels (Critical)
Ralph routes work by reading the **first matching label** on each direct epic child task.

### Label Mapping (Use Exactly One)
- `engineering`: code changes, config, scripts, Storybook setup
- `qa`: testing, validation, running checks, evidence capture
- `design`: UX or visual decision-only tasks
- `project-manager`: explicit PM checkpoints, final report task

**Policy:** Do not create epic children without one of the labels above. Use `project-manager` for coordination/doc-only tasks.

**Rule:** direct epic children must have exactly one routing label. Subtasks should be unlabeled unless you want separate routing.

**Beads CLI note (source of many drift bugs):**
- When creating issues, the correct flag is `bd create --labels <label>` (not `--label`).
- Beads supports multiple labels, but for Ralph routing you should pass exactly one label for direct epic children.
- If you need to fix labels after creation, prefer replacing them explicitly:
  ```bash
  bd update <TASK_ID> --set-labels <label> --json
  ```

## Dependencies & Parent Linkage
- **Create-first, link-second (required):**
  - Create the epic and all direct children first (IDs + fields + exactly one routing label).
  - Then add dependency edges with `bd dep add <task-id> <depends-on-id>` (defaults to a blocking dependency).
  - Rationale: `bd create` can be run reliably one task at a time, and dependency linking can be retried independently if something interrupts the session.
- **Parent linkage (safe by default):**
  - Prefer hierarchical IDs (`<epic>.<task>`) for readability.
  - **Still:** After creating each direct epic child (and the report task), explicitly set the parent so epic-scoped queries work reliably:
    ```bash
    bd update <TASK_ID> --parent <EPIC_ID> --json
    ```
  - Why: `bd ready --parent <EPIC_ID>` and other parent-scoped filters often rely on the explicit `parent` field, not just ID structure.

## Resumable Procedure (Recommended)
- **Create issues individually** (epic first, then each direct child task).
- **Link dependencies after all creates** using `bd dep add <task-id> <depends-on-id>`.
- After any interruption, rerun starting from the first missing ID; linking deps can always be retried.
- Verify at the end:
  - `bd show <epic-id> --json`
  - `bd dep tree <epic-id>`
  - `bd ready --parent <epic-id> --limit 200 --json`

## Required Final Report Task
Always add a final task: **"Generate Epic Revise Report"**.
- Depends on all top-level tasks.
- Label: `project-manager`.
- Acceptance criteria include generating the revise report and updating epic status.

## Quality Gates
- Detect from repo `package.json` using the **Quality Gate Detection** skill.
- Include them in the epic description.
- Do not invent gates that do not exist.

## Ralph Readiness Checklist
- Epic created with plan reference + deliverable summary + quality gates.
- All direct epic children present and **exactly one valid routing label** applied.
- Dependencies set correctly; `bd ready --parent <EPIC_ID> --limit 200` shows expected tasks.
- `.devagent/plugins/ralph/tools/config.json` includes valid `git` and `ai_tool` sections.
- Working branch exists and matches config before starting execution.

## Notes on Extraction
Manual extraction from the plan is the default. The setup workflow defines the process and required fields; avoid ad-hoc parsing scripts unless explicitly requested.

**Epic (Parent Task):**

The epic description must be comprehensive and include:
1. Plan document reference
2. Final deliverable summary (from plan's "Summary" section in PART 1)
3. Final quality gates that must pass

```json
{
  "id": "<epic-id>",
  "title": "<plan-title>",
  "description": "Plan document: <absolute-path-to-plan>\n\nFinal Deliverable: [extract from plan's Summary section in PART 1, or Functional Narrative if Summary is not descriptive enough]\n\nFinal Quality Gates:\n- All tests passing (npm test)\n- Lint clean (npm run lint)\n- Typecheck passing (npm run typecheck)\n- [Include any additional gates from quality-gates.json template]",
  "status": "open"
}
```

**Instructions for Epic Description:**
1. Read the plan document to extract:
   - Summary section (PART 1) - use this for "Final Deliverable" if it clearly describes the end result
   - If Summary is too high-level, use the Functional Narrative section to describe what the final output should be
2. Reference the quality gates template (`.devagent/plugins/ralph/quality-gates/typescript.json` or project-specific template) to list all quality gates that must pass
3. Format as a clear, multi-line description that agents can reference when working on tasks

**Main Tasks:**

Construct the `description` field by combining context fields.

```json
{
  "id": "<epic-id>.<number>",
  "title": "<task-title>",
  "description": "Objective: <objective>\n\nImpacted Modules/Files:\n<impacted-modules>\n\nReferences:\n<references>\n\nTesting Criteria:\n<testing-criteria>",
  "acceptance_criteria": ["<criterion-1>", "<criterion-2>", ...],
  "priority": "normal",
  "status": "open",
  "parent_id": "<epic-id>",
  "depends_on": ["<epic-id>.<dependency-number>", ...],
  "notes": "Plan document: <absolute-path-to-plan>"
}
```

**Subtasks:**

```json
{
  "id": "<epic-id>.<task-number>.<subtask-number>",
  "title": "<subtask-title>",
  "description": "",
  "acceptance_criteria": [],
  "priority": "normal",
  "status": "open",
  "parent_id": "<epic-id>.<task-number>",
  "depends_on": [],
  "notes": "Plan document: <absolute-path-to-plan>"
}
```

**Important:** Always include the absolute path to the source plan document in:
- Epic `description` field
- Each task's `notes` field (for both main tasks and subtasks)

This ensures agents can unambiguously reference the specific plan document when working on tasks.

### Labeling Rules (Routing)

Ralph routes tasks based on **labels** attached to the epic's direct child tasks.

- **Direct epic children:** Must have **exactly one** routing label from the keys in `.devagent/plugins/ralph/tools/config.json` → `agents`.
- **Subtasks:** Unlabeled by default (context-only). Only add a label if you intentionally want distinct routing.
- **Fallback:** If you cannot confidently pick a specialized label, use `project-manager`.
- **Explicit PM checkpoints:** Use `project-manager` only for phase check-ins or final reviews.

**Implementation note:** This conversion output may not embed labels directly. If labels are applied during `bd create`, ensure the one-level labeling rule is followed there.

### UI-Sensitivity Heuristic (Design Task Creation)

Use the signals below to decide when a plan is UI-sensitive and merits a design task (keep this judgment contextual).

**UI-sensitive signals (lightweight heuristic):**
- Impacted files include UI extensions: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, `.less`, `.html`
- Plan text mentions UI/UX keywords: `UI`, `UX`, `design`, `component`, `layout`, `visual`, `styling`, `page`, `screen`, `modal`, `drawer`, `navbar`, `table`, `chart`, `responsive`, `mobile`, `accessibility`, `storybook`
- Acceptance criteria describe visual states, layout changes, or component variants
- Plan involves building new components or component variants

**Design task deliverables (embed in description/design field):**
- Intent + observable acceptance (testable UI behavior)
- Component inventory/reuse list with code references
- Storybook stories when available (do not set up Storybook in the task; create a follow-up task if missing)
- Minimum artifact when Storybook is missing: lightweight mockup or annotated screenshot + acceptance bullets + component inventory

**Notes:** Design output must live in the design task comments with links to artifacts (Storybook paths, screenshots, mockups).

### Step 4: Resolve Dependencies

For each task with dependencies:

1. Parse dependency text to extract task numbers
2. Map task numbers to generated task IDs
3. Populate `depends_on` array with dependency task IDs
4. If dependencies reference tasks not yet created, ensure topological ordering

### Step 5: Append Epic Report Task (Quality Gate)

**Objective:** Ensure every Epic concludes with a mandatory revise report that runs only after all tasks are complete.

**Instructions:**

1. Determine the highest task number (N) from the parsed plan.
2. Create a final task with number N+1.
3. **ID:** `<epic-id>.<N+1>`
4. **Title:** "Generate Epic Revise Report"
5. **Label:** "project-manager" (this task uses the project-manager agent for final review)
6. **Description:** "Auto-generated epic quality gate. This task runs only after all other epic tasks are closed or blocked.

**Steps:**
1. Verify that all child tasks have status 'closed' or 'blocked' (no 'open', 'in_progress' tasks remain)
2. Generate the revise report by following `.devagent/plugins/ralph/workflows/generate-revise-report.md`
3. **Epic Status Management:**
   - If ALL tasks are closed (no blocked tasks): Close the epic with `bd update <epic-id> --status closed` and close this report task
   - If ANY tasks are blocked: **Do not block the epic.** Keep the epic `open`, leave this report task `open`, and add a comment explaining which tasks remain blocked and what to re-check on the next run"
6. **Acceptance Criteria:** ["All child tasks are closed or blocked", "Report generated in .devagent/workspace/reviews/", "Epic closed only when all tasks are closed; report task left open with blocker summary when blocked tasks remain"]
7. **Dependencies:** Array containing IDs of ALL other top-level tasks (e.g., `["<epic-id>.1", "<epic-id>.2", ...]`). This ensures the task only becomes ready when all dependencies are complete.
8. **Notes:** Include plan document path: `"Plan document: <absolute-path-to-plan>"`
9. Add this task to the `tasks` array.
10. **Manual backfill:** If an epic is missing the report task, add it using the steps above (set dependencies and parent). Do not add a router-driven auto-close backstop; the report task is the only canonical epic closer.
11. **Post-close policy:** If new tasks are added after an epic is closed, do not auto-reopen the epic (manual only).

### Step Ordering and Numbering (Important)

If you rely on string sorting, hierarchical IDs will sort incorrectly once task numbers exceed 9 (for example, `<epic-id>.10` comes before `<epic-id>.2`).

- **Always** preserve plan order by comparing hierarchical numeric segments (split on `.` and compare numbers).
- This affects both:
  - **Execution order** (when selecting the "first" ready task)
  - **UI ordering** (task boards/lists that display tasks)

### Step 6: Generate Complete Payload

**Full JSON Structure:**

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "source_plan": "<absolute-path-to-plan>",
    "generated_at": "<ISO-8601-UTC-timestamp>Z"
  },
  "ralph_integration": {
    "ready_command": "bd ready --parent <EPIC_ID> --limit 200",
    "status_updates": {
      "in_progress": "in_progress",
      "closed": "closed"
    },
    "progress_comments": true
  },
  "epics": [
    {
      "id": "<epic-id>",
      "title": "<plan-title>",
      "description": "",
      "status": "open"
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    /* array of task objects */
  ]
}
```

### Step 6: Write Output

Write the complete JSON payload to:

- Path: `<output-dir>/beads-payload.json`
- Format: Pretty-printed JSON with 2-space indentation
- Encoding: UTF-8

## Edge Cases

**Missing Sections:**

- If "Implementation Tasks" section not found, report error and stop
- If individual tasks lack required fields (Objective, Acceptance Criteria), use empty values

**Dependency Resolution:**

- If dependency references non-existent task, log warning and omit dependency
- If "None" specified for dependencies, use empty array

**Empty Lists:**

- If no subtasks, omit subtask generation
- If no acceptance criteria, use empty array
- If no dependencies, use empty array

**Special Characters:**

- Preserve markdown formatting in descriptions (can be cleaned later by Beads)
- Handle unicode characters in titles and descriptions

## Validation

Before writing output, validate:

1. At least one task exists (epic alone is invalid)
2. All task IDs are unique
3. All dependency references resolve to existing task IDs
4. All tasks have valid parent_id references
5. JSON structure matches Beads schema
