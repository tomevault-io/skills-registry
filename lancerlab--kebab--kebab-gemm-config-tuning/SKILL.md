# Kebab GEMM Config Tuning

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to change GEMM benchmark parameters
- User asks to compare layout modes (`RR`, `RC`, `CR`, `CC`)
- User asks to test precision (`float16`, `bfloat16`, `float32`) or kernel version lists
- User asks for tile-size and occupancy-oriented tuning plans

## Key Configuration Surface

Main file: `config.yaml`

Important keys under `operators.gemm`:

- `impl`
- `versions`
- `matrix_sizes`
- `modes`
- `precisions`
- `tile_sizes`
- `init_method`

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. Edit `config.yaml` with one controlled change at a time.
2. Build and run benchmark:
   - `make build`
   - `make bench-gemm`
3. For deeper analysis, run:
   - `make tune-gemm-cute` (or cuda/ref)
4. Save and compare outputs from `bench_results/`, `profiling/`, and `reports/`.

## Tuning Rules from Repository Context

- Hopper/WGMMA paths generally expect `sm_90a`.
- The documented tile constraint notes K dimension compatibility requirements for GMMA pathways.
- Keep experiment dimensions and precision explicit to ensure reproducibility.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Unexpected perf regression | Revert to previous `versions`/`tile_sizes` baseline and isolate one variable |
| Precision mismatch | Verify selected kernel path supports requested precision |
| Layout-specific anomaly | Test all `modes` and compare independently |
