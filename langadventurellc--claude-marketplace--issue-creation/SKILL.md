description: This skill should be used when the user asks to create Trellis issues including "create a project", "create epics", "create features", "create tasks", "new project", "new epic", "new feature", "new task", "break down project into epics", "break down epic into features", "break down feature into tasks", "decompose project", "decompose epic", "decompose feature", or mentions creating any type of issue in Trellis. Use when this capability is needed.

# Create Trellis Issues

Create issues in the Trellis task management system. This skill supports creating all issue types: projects, epics, features, and tasks.

## Issue Type Hierarchy

Trellis uses a hierarchical issue structure:

```
Project -> Epic -> Feature -> Task
```

- **Project**: Top-level container representing a complete initiative
- **Epic**: Major work stream within a project
- **Feature**: Implementable functionality within an epic
- **Task**: Atomic unit of work (1-2 hours) within a feature

Each type can be created standalone or within its parent hierarchy.

## Determining Issue Type

Based on the user's request, determine which issue type to create:

| User Request                                                         | Issue Type | Reference                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| "create a project", "new project", "set up project management"       | Project    | [project.md](project.md) |
| "create epics", "break down project into epics", "decompose project" | Epic       | [epic.md](epic.md)       |
| "create features", "break down epic into features", "decompose epic" | Feature    | [feature.md](feature.md) |
| "create tasks", "break down feature into tasks", "decompose feature" | Task       | [task.md](task.md)       |

## Instructions

1. **Identify the issue type** the user wants to create based on their request
2. **Read the appropriate type-specific file** for detailed creation instructions:
   - For projects: Read [project.md](project.md)
   - For epics: Read [epic.md](epic.md)
   - For features: Read [feature.md](feature.md)
   - For tasks: Read [task.md](task.md)
3. **Follow the detailed process** in that file to gather requirements and create the issue(s)

## Critical Rule: Create Only the Requested Issue Type

**STOP after creating the identified issue type.** Do not automatically create child issues.

- If the user asks to "create a project" → Create the project, then STOP
- If the user asks to "create epics for project P-123" → Create the epics, then STOP
- If the user asks to "create features for epic E-456" → Create the features, then STOP
- If the user asks to "create tasks for feature F-789" → Create the tasks, then STOP

**Do NOT continue to break down the hierarchy further.** Each level of decomposition requires a separate user request. After creating issues, report what was created and wait for further instructions.

## Common Principles

All issue types share these principles:

- **Research the codebase FIRST** - Before creating any issues, search the codebase to understand current state. Parent issues may be outdated. The codebase is the source of truth.
- **Create only what was requested** - If asked to create a project, create the project only. Do not also create epics, features, or tasks unless explicitly asked.
- **Default to coarser granularity** - Prefer fewer, larger issues that are easier for AI agents to orchestrate. Don't create many tiny issues.
- **Ask questions only when necessary** - Only ask when requirements are genuinely ambiguous, critical information is missing, or decisions have significant irreversible consequences.
- **Include acceptance criteria** - All issues should have measurable success criteria.
- **Keep it simple** - Follow KISS, YAGNI principles. Don't over-engineer the structure.
- **Create sequentially** - When creating multiple issues, do them one at a time, not in parallel.
