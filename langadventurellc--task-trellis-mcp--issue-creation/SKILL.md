# Create Trellis Issues

Create issues in the Trellis task management system. This skill supports creating all issue types: projects, epics, features, and tasks.

## Issue Type Hierarchy

Trellis uses a hierarchical issue structure:

```
Project -> Epic -> Feature -> Task
```

- **Project**: Top-level container representing a complete initiative
- **Epic**: Major work stream within a project
- **Feature**: Implementable functionality within an epic
- **Task**: Atomic unit of work (1-2 hours) within a feature

Each type can be created standalone or within its parent hierarchy.

## Determining Issue Type

Based on the user's request, determine which issue type to create:

| User Request                                                         | Issue Type | Reference                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| "create a project", "new project", "set up project management"       | Project    | [project.md](project.md) |
| "create epics", "break down project into epics", "decompose project" | Epic       | [epic.md](epic.md)       |
| "create features", "break down epic into features", "decompose epic" | Feature    | [feature.md](feature.md) |
| "create tasks", "break down feature into tasks", "decompose feature" | Task       | [task.md](task.md)       |

## Instructions

1. **Identify the issue type** the user wants to create based on their request
2. **Read the appropriate type-specific file** for detailed creation instructions:
   - For projects: Read [project.md](project.md)
   - For epics: Read [epic.md](epic.md)
   - For features: Read [feature.md](feature.md)
   - For tasks: Read [task.md](task.md)
3. **Follow the detailed process** in that file to gather requirements and create the issue(s)

## Common Principles

All issue types share these principles:

- **Ask clarifying questions** - Use AskUserQuestion when uncertain. Agents tend to be overconfident about what they can infer.
- **Search the codebase** - Look for existing patterns and conventions before creating issues.
- **Include acceptance criteria** - All issues should have measurable success criteria.
- **Keep it simple** - Follow KISS, YAGNI principles. Don't over-engineer the structure.
- **Create sequentially** - When creating multiple issues, do them one at a time, not in parallel.
