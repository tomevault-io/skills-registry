# Care Gap Identifier

## Overview

Screen a patient for preventive care gaps based on USPSTF grade A and B recommendations. Query FHIR resources for prior screenings, immunizations, and relevant observations. Compare against age, sex, and risk-factor-adjusted intervals. Generate a prioritized list of overdue and upcoming preventive care items with patient-friendly descriptions.

## FHIR Resources Used

| Resource | Purpose | Key Fields |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Patient | Demographics (age, sex, risk factors) | birthDate, gender, extension (race/ethnicity) |
| Condition | Risk factors modifying screening criteria | code, clinicalStatus, onsetDateTime |
| Observation | Screening results (labs, vital signs) | code, valueQuantity, effectiveDateTime, status |
| Procedure | Completed screenings (colonoscopy, mammogram) | code, performedDateTime, status |
| Immunization | Vaccination history | vaccineCode, occurrenceDateTime, status |
| DiagnosticReport | Imaging results (mammogram, LDCT, DEXA) | code, effectiveDateTime, conclusion |
| MedicationStatement | Medications affecting screening (e.g., statins) | medicationCodeableConcept, status |
| FamilyMemberHistory | Family risk factors (cancer, CVD) | condition, relationship |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Retrieve Patient Demographics

```
Tool: fhir_read
resourceType: "Patient"
id: "[patient-id]"
```

Extract and calculate:
- Age from `birthDate`
- Sex from `gender` (administrative gender; biological sex may differ)
- Smoking status: check Observation with LOINC 72166-2

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Observation"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&code=72166-2&_sort=-date&_count=1"
```

### Step 2: Retrieve Active Conditions (Risk Factors)

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Condition"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&clinical-status=active"
```

Identify risk-modifying conditions:
- Diabetes (SNOMED 44054006) -- affects statin, BP screening thresholds
- HIV (SNOMED 86406008) -- affects STI, cancer screening frequency
- Obesity (SNOMED 414916001) -- affects diabetes screening age
- Immunocompromised states -- affects immunization recommendations

- BRCA carrier status -- different breast cancer screening

### Step 3: Retrieve Family History

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "FamilyMemberHistory"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]"
```

Key family history items affecting screening:
- First-degree relative with colorectal cancer before age 60 -- start screening at 40 or 10 years before youngest case

```

## Troubleshooting

### Screening Dates Not Found in Expected Resources
- Mammography may be stored as Procedure (SNOMED 71651007), DiagnosticReport, or Observation. Search all three resource types.
- External screenings (done at another facility) may not be in the FHIR server. If critical screenings show as "never done" for a patient who reports otherwise, note that the record may be incomplete.

### Patient Gender Does Not Match Expected Screening Criteria
- FHIR `Patient.gender` is administrative gender. Sex-specific screenings (cervical, breast, prostate) should be based on biological sex, which may be in an extension (`http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-birthsex`). Check the extension before excluding screenings.
- If birth sex extension is unavailable, apply screenings based on administrative gender but note the limitation.

### Immunization Records Are Incomplete
- Patients vaccinated before EHR adoption may not have historical records. If Immunization search returns zero results, note "No immunization records found -- may need patient-reported history or state immunization registry query."
- Check state IIS (Immunization Information System) if FHIR server supports it.
