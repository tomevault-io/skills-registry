# Discharge Summary Writer

## Overview

Generate comprehensive discharge summaries meeting CMS Conditions of Participation (CoP) and The Joint Commission (TJC) requirements. Pull admission and discharge diagnoses, hospital course data, procedures performed, discharge medication list with changes from admission highlighted, follow-up appointments, discharge condition, and generate patient-appropriate discharge instructions. Per CMS CoP 482.24(c)(2), discharge summaries must include: reason for hospitalization, significant findings, procedures performed, treatment rendered, patient condition at discharge, patient/family instructions, and attending signature.

## FHIR Resources Used

| Resource | Purpose | Key Fields |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Encounter | Admission/discharge context, LOS | period, reasonCode, hospitalization, diagnosis |
| Patient | Demographics, language preference | name, birthDate, gender, communication |
| Condition | Admission dx, discharge dx, active problems | code, clinicalStatus, category, encounter |
| Procedure | Procedures during hospitalization | code, performedDateTime, outcome, report |
| MedicationRequest | Discharge medications vs admission meds | medicationCodeableConcept, status, intent, authoredOn, dosageInstruction |
| MedicationStatement | Pre-admission home medication list | medicationCodeableConcept, dosage, status |
| AllergyIntolerance | Allergy list for summary | code, reaction, clinicalStatus |
| DiagnosticReport | Significant findings, pathology | code, conclusion, effectiveDateTime |
| Observation | Key labs at discharge, vitals | code, value[x], effectiveDateTime |
| CarePlan | Follow-up plans, discharge instructions | activity, description, period |
| Appointment | Follow-up appointments scheduled | status, serviceType, start, participant |
| DocumentReference | Persist the discharge summary | type, content, context |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Retrieve Encounter Details

```
Tool: fhir_read
resourceType: "Encounter"
id: "[encounter-id]"
```

Extract:
- **Admission date**: `period.start`
- **Discharge date**: `period.end` (or today if discharging now)
- **Length of stay**: Calculate from period
- **Admission reason**: `reasonCode`
- **Discharge disposition**: `hospitalization.dischargeDisposition.coding[0].display`
- **Encounter diagnoses**: `diagnosis` array with `use.coding[0].code` (AD = admission, DD = discharge)

### Step 2: Retrieve Patient Demographics

```
Tool: fhir_read
resourceType: "Patient"
id: "[patient-id]"
```

Extract: name, DOB, age, gender, preferred language (for instruction readability), PCP from `generalPractitioner`.

### Step 3: Pull Admission and Discharge Diagnoses

**3a: Encounter-linked diagnoses**
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Condition"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&encounter=[encounter-id]"
```

**3b: All active conditions at discharge**
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Condition"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&clinical-status=active"
```

Separate into:
- **Principal discharge diagnosis**: Condition from encounter diagnosis list with rank=1 or use=DD
- **Secondary diagnoses**: Remaining encounter diagnoses
- **Chronic conditions**: Active conditions not linked to this encounter

### Step 4: Pull Procedures Performed During Hospitalization

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Procedure"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&encounter=[encounter-id]&status=completed"
```

For each procedure:
- Name from `code.coding[0].display`
- Date from `performedDateTime`
- Outcome from `outcome.coding[0].display` if available
- Complications from `complication` if present

### Step 5: Build Discharge Medication List with Changes

**5a: Current discharge medications**
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "MedicationRequest"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active&intent=order&_count=100"
```

**5b: Pre-admission home medications**
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "MedicationStatement"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active,on-hold,completed&_count=100"
```

**5c: Stopped medications**
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "MedicationRequest"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=stopped,cancelled&authoredon=ge[admission-date]&_count=100"
```

Compare lists and categorize each medication:
- **CONTINUE**: Same medication, same dose as home
- **NEW**: Started during hospitalization (authoredOn >= admission date, no matching home med)
- **CHANGED**: Same medication, different dose/frequency/route
- **DISCONTINUED**: On home list but stopped during admission
- **ON HOLD**: Temporarily held (e.g., metformin held for contrast)

### Step 6: Pull Significant Findings and Results

**6a: Key diagnostic reports**
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "DiagnosticReport"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&date=ge[admission-date]&_sort=-date"
```

**6b: Discharge vitals**
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Observation"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=vital-signs&_sort=-date&_count=10"
```

**6c: Discharge labs (most recent)**
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Observation"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=laboratory&_sort=-date&_count=30"
```

### Step 7: Pull Follow-Up Appointments

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Appointment"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&date=ge[discharge-date]&status=booked,proposed&_sort=date"
```

If no appointments found, flag as "No follow-up appointments scheduled -- ACTION REQUIRED."

### Step 8: Pull Care Plan and Discharge Instructions

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "CarePlan"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active&_sort=-date&_count=5"
```

### Step 9: Pull Allergies

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "AllergyIntolerance"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&clinical-status=active"
```

### Step 10: Assemble Discharge Summary

```

5. `fhir_search` Observation discharge labs. Returns: WBC 7.2 (normalized), procalcitonin 0.15 (normalized).

**Result**: Full discharge summary with antibiotic course completion instructions, return precautions for fever/dyspnea, pneumococcal and influenza vaccination status check, PCP follow-up with repeat CXR in 6 weeks.

## Troubleshooting

### Encounter diagnosis array is empty
- Search Condition resources linked to the encounter: `fhir_search` Condition with `encounter=[encounter-id]`.
- Check `Encounter.reasonCode` as a fallback for admission diagnosis.
- Some systems populate diagnoses only in the billing system. If no structured diagnoses are found, flag: "Discharge diagnoses require clinician input -- no structured diagnosis data linked to encounter."

### MedicationStatement not available for home medication comparison
- Use the earliest MedicationRequest records (those with `authoredOn` before admission) as a proxy for the pre-admission medication list.
- Check if a medication reconciliation DocumentReference exists from admission: `fhir_search` DocumentReference with `type=http://loinc.org|11503-0` (medication reconciliation note).
- Flag medications where home vs hospital comparison could not be performed.

### No follow-up appointments found in FHIR
- Appointment resources may not be created until closer to discharge. Flag prominently: "No follow-up appointments found -- SCHEDULE REQUIRED per CMS/TJC requirements."
- Check CarePlan for planned follow-up activities that may not yet have corresponding Appointment resources.
