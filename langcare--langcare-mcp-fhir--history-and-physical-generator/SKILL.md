# History and Physical Generator

## Overview

Generate a comprehensive History and Physical document from FHIR resources. Auto-populate all available structured data including past medical history, past surgical history, medication list, allergy list, family history, social history, and current vital signs/labs. Flag data gaps requiring clinician input. Support regulatory requirements for admission H&P per CMS CoP and TJC standards (must be completed within 24 hours of admission, updated within 30 days if pre-admission H&P exists).

## FHIR Resources Used

| Resource | Purpose | Key Fields |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Patient | Demographics, social determinants | name, birthDate, gender, communication, extension |
| Encounter | Admission context, reason for admission | class, reasonCode, period, hospitalization |
| Condition | PMH, current diagnoses | code, clinicalStatus, onsetDateTime, category |
| Procedure | Past surgical history | code, performedDateTime, status |
| MedicationRequest | Current and home medications | medicationCodeableConcept, dosageInstruction, status |
| AllergyIntolerance | Allergies and adverse reactions | code, reaction, clinicalStatus, criticality |
| FamilyMemberHistory | Family medical history | relationship, condition, deceasedBoolean |
| Observation | Vitals, labs, social history | code, value[x], category, effectiveDateTime |
| DocumentReference | Prior H&P documents | type, content, date |
| CarePlan | Existing care plans | status, intent, category, activity |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Retrieve Admission Encounter

```
Tool: fhir_read
resourceType: "Encounter"
id: "[encounter-id]"
```

Extract:
- **Admitting diagnosis**: `reasonCode` array
- **Admission date/time**: `period.start`
- **Encounter class**: `class.code` (IMP = inpatient, OBSENC = observation)
- **Admitting physician**: `participant` where `type.coding.code` = "ADM"
- **Source of admission**: `hospitalization.admitSource`

If no encounter ID provided:
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Encounter"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&class=IMP&status=in-progress&_sort=-date&_count=1"
```

### Step 2: Retrieve Patient Demographics

```
Tool: fhir_read
resourceType: "Patient"
id: "[patient-id]"
```

Extract: name, DOB (age), gender, preferred language, race/ethnicity from US Core extensions.

### Step 3: Pull Past Medical History (PMH)

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Condition"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&clinical-status=active,recurrence,remission&_count=100&_sort=-onset-date"
```

Categorize conditions:
- **Active chronic conditions**: clinicalStatus=active with onset > 30 days ago
- **Active acute conditions**: clinicalStatus=active with onset <= 30 days
- **Conditions in remission**: clinicalStatus=remission (e.g., cancer history)
- Include onset date for each if available from `onsetDateTime`

### Step 4: Pull Past Surgical History (PSH)

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Procedure"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=completed&_count=100&_sort=-date"
```

Filter to surgical procedures. Present chronologically with procedure date. Include:
- Procedure name from `code.coding[0].display`
- Date performed from `performedDateTime` or `performedPeriod.start`
- Relevant notes from `note`

### Step 5: Pull Current Medications

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "MedicationRequest"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active,on-hold&_count=100"
```

For each medication extract:
- Drug name (prefer RxNorm display)
- Dose and frequency from `dosageInstruction`
- Route from `dosageInstruction.route`
- Prescriber from `requester`
- Intent: distinguish `order` (active prescription) from `plan` (intended)

### Step 6: Pull Allergies

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "AllergyIntolerance"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&clinical-status=active"
```

For each allergy:
- Substance from `code.coding[0].display`
- Reaction type from `reaction[0].manifestation[0].coding[0].display`
- Severity from `reaction[0].severity` (mild, moderate, severe)
- Criticality from `criticality` (low, high, unable-to-assess)

If zero results, explicitly state "NKDA (No Known Drug Allergies)" but flag that allergy review status should be confirmed.

### Step 7: Pull Family History

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "FamilyMemberHistory"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=completed"
```

Organize by relationship:
- Parents: conditions, age of onset, deceased status
- Siblings: conditions
- Grandparents: conditions (if available)
- Flag hereditary risk factors (CAD, diabetes, cancer syndromes)

If no FamilyMemberHistory resources exist, flag as "Family history not documented in structured data."

### Step 8: Pull Social History

Search for social history Observations:
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Observation"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=social-history"
```

Key LOINC codes for social history:
- 72166-2: Tobacco smoking status
- 11367-0: History of tobacco use
- 74013-4: Alcoholic drinks per day
- 96842-0: Substance use
- 63512-8: Employment status
- 76690-7: Sexual orientation
- 71802-3: Housing status
- 82810-3: Pregnancy status (if applicable)

### Step 9: Pull Current Vital Signs

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Observation"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=vital-signs&_sort=-date&_count=10"
```

Use most recent set. Map by LOINC (same as SOAP note: 8310-5, 8867-4, 9279-1, 85354-9, 29463-7, 8302-2, 59408-5, 39156-5).

### Step 10: Pull Recent Labs

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Observation"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=laboratory&_sort=-date&_count=50"
```

Group by panel. Flag abnormal values. Include reference ranges from `referenceRange`.

### Step 11: Check for Prior H&P

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "DocumentReference"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&type=http://loinc.org|34117-2&_sort=-date&_count=1"
```

LOINC 34117-2 = History and physical note. If found within 30 days, note it as available for update rather than full rewrite (per CMS/TJC).

### Step 12: Assemble H&P Document

## Troubleshooting

### FamilyMemberHistory returns zero resources
- Family history is often not captured as structured FHIR data. Flag as "Family history not available in structured format -- obtain from patient interview."
- Some systems store family history in Observation resources with category=social-history. Check Observation search results for family-related LOINC codes (54114-4 = Family member health history).

### Condition resources lack onset dates
- Use `recordedDate` as a fallback for when the condition was first documented.
- If neither `onsetDateTime` nor `recordedDate` exists, present the condition without a date and note "onset unknown."
- Check `Condition.evidence` for linked Observations that may have dates.

### Social history Observations are missing or sparse
- Social history is variably captured across EMR systems. Flag each missing element explicitly in the DATA GAPS section.
- Check for SDOH (Social Determinants of Health) data in Observation with category=sdoh if the FHIR server supports US Core 5.0+.
