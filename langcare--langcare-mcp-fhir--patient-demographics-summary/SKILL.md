# Patient Demographics Summary

## Overview

Pull structured demographic data from FHIR Patient, RelatedPerson, and Coverage resources. Format into a consolidated summary including identifiers, contact information, emergency contacts, insurance, preferred language, communication preferences, and advance directive status. Flag missing critical data elements that may affect care delivery.

## FHIR Resources Used

| Resource | Purpose | Key Fields |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Patient | Core demographics | name, birthDate, gender, address, telecom, communication, identifier, extension |
| RelatedPerson | Emergency contacts, guarantors | name, telecom, relationship, period |
| Coverage | Insurance information | status, type, subscriberId, payor, period, class |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Retrieve Patient Resource

```
Tool: fhir_read
resourceType: "Patient"
id: "[patient-id]"
```

Extract the following fields:
- **Identifiers**: MRN (`identifier` where `type.coding.code` = "MR"), SSN (last 4 only), driver's license
- **Name**: `name` array -- use `name.use` = "official" as primary; note maiden names (`use` = "maiden")
- **Birth Date**: `birthDate` (calculate age)
- **Gender**: `gender` (administrative gender)
- **Race/Ethnicity**: US Core extensions at `extension` where URL = `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-race` and `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-ethnicity`
- **Address**: `address` array -- identify `use` = "home" vs "work" vs "temp"
- **Telecom**: `telecom` array -- phone (`system` = "phone"), email (`system` = "email"), fax
- **Preferred Language**: `communication` array where `preferred` = true
- **Marital Status**: `maritalStatus`
- **Deceased**: `deceasedBoolean` or `deceasedDateTime`
- **Managing Organization**: `managingOrganization`

### Step 2: Retrieve Emergency Contacts and Related Persons

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "RelatedPerson"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]"
```

For each RelatedPerson:
- Extract name, relationship type (`relationship.coding.code`), phone, email
- Check `period` to confirm the relationship is current (no `end` date or `end` > today)
- Identify relationship roles: emergency contact, next of kin, guarantor, power of attorney

### Step 3: Retrieve Insurance Coverage

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Coverage"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active"
```

For each active Coverage:
- Plan name from `class` where `type.coding.code` = "plan"
- Group number from `class` where `type.coding.code` = "group"
- Subscriber ID from `subscriberId`
- Payor organization from `payor` reference
- Coverage period from `period`
- Coverage order (`order` field: 1 = primary, 2 = secondary)

### Step 4: Check for Advance Directives

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Consent"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/consentcategorycodes|acd"
```

If no results, also search:
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "DocumentReference"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&type=http://loinc.org|64298-3"
```

LOINC 64298-3 = Power of attorney / Advance directive

### Step 5: Flag Missing Critical Data

Scan the collected data and flag any of the following as missing:
- No emergency contact (zero RelatedPerson resources or none with emergency contact relationship)
- No active insurance coverage
- No preferred language specified
- No allergy documentation status (check if `AllergyIntolerance` search returns zero results -- this indicates allergies have not been reviewed, not that there are none)
- No advance directive on file
- Missing phone number or email
- Missing address

### Step 6: Format Output

Present the summary in this structure:

```

MRN: [identifier]
DOB: [birthDate] (Age: [calculated])
Gender: [gender]

## Examples

### Example 1: Complete Demographics Pull

**User says:** "Pull up demographics for patient 12345"

**Actions:**
1. `fhir_read` Patient/12345 -- returns full Patient resource with name, DOB, address, telecom, US Core race/ethnicity extensions
2. `fhir_search` RelatedPerson?patient=12345 -- returns 2 entries: spouse (emergency contact), adult child (next of kin)
3. `fhir_search` Coverage?patient=12345&status=active -- returns 1 active Coverage: Blue Cross PPO, primary
4. `fhir_search` Consent?patient=12345&category=... -- returns 1 advance directive

**Result:**
```

**Actions:**
1. `fhir_read` Patient/abc-789 -- returns minimal Patient resource: name and DOB only, no telecom, no extensions
2. `fhir_search` RelatedPerson?patient=abc-789 -- returns 0 entries
3. `fhir_search` Coverage?patient=abc-789&status=active -- returns 0 entries
4. `fhir_search` Consent?patient=abc-789&category=... -- returns 0 entries

**Result:**
```
PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS

Marital Status: Unknown

CONTACT INFORMATION

```

## Troubleshooting

### No Patient Resource Found
- Verify the patient ID is correct. Try searching by name and DOB instead:
  ```
  Tool: fhir_search
  resourceType: "Patient"
  queryParams: "family=[lastname]&given=[firstname]&birthdate=[YYYY-MM-DD]"
  ```
- Check if the ID format matches the FHIR server's expectations (some use UUIDs, others use numeric IDs).

### RelatedPerson Search Returns Empty But Patient Has Emergency Contact in Record
- Some EHR systems store emergency contacts as extensions on the Patient resource rather than as separate RelatedPerson resources. Check `Patient.contact` array for embedded contact entries:
  ```
  Patient.contact[].relationship
  Patient.contact[].name
  Patient.contact[].telecom
  ```
- EPIC systems often use the `Patient.contact` array instead of RelatedPerson resources.

### Coverage Resources Missing Plan Details
- The `class` array may use different type codes depending on the payer. Check for `type.coding.code` values: "plan", "group", "subplan", "subgroup", "rxbin", "rxpcn".
- Some systems populate plan details in the `payor` referenced Organization resource. Follow the reference with `fhir_read` on the Organization.
