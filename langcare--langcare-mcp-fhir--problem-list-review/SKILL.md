# Problem List Review

## Overview

Perform a structured audit of the active problem list by pulling Condition resources and cross-referencing with MedicationRequests, recent Encounters, and Observations. Identify clinical discrepancies: conditions without active treatment, resolved conditions still listed as active, medications implying undocumented conditions, and ICD-10 coding specificity opportunities. Output actionable findings for clinical review.

## FHIR Resources Used

| Resource | Purpose | Search Parameters |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Condition | Active problem list | patient, clinical-status |
| MedicationRequest | Cross-reference treatments | patient, status=active |
| Encounter | Recent visit context | patient, date |
| Observation | Lab correlation | patient, category=laboratory, code |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Pull All Conditions

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Condition"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]"
```

Retrieve all conditions regardless of status. Categorize each by:
- `clinicalStatus`: active, recurrence, relapse, inactive, remission, resolved
- `verificationStatus`: confirmed, unconfirmed, provisional, differential, refuted, entered-in-error
- `category`: problem-list-item, encounter-diagnosis, health-concern
- `code.coding`: Extract SNOMED CT code and ICD-10-CM code if present

Build two lists:
1. **Active conditions** (clinicalStatus = active, recurrence, or relapse)
2. **Inactive/resolved conditions** (clinicalStatus = inactive, remission, or resolved)

### Step 2: Pull Active Medications

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "MedicationRequest"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active"
```

For each medication, extract:
- Drug name and RxNorm code from `medicationCodeableConcept`
- Drug class (infer from name suffix or RxNorm hierarchy)
- Dosage from `dosageInstruction`

### Step 3: Pull Recent Encounters (Last 12 Months)

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Encounter"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&date=ge[12-months-ago]&_sort=-date"
```

Extract encounter diagnoses from `reasonCode` or associated `Condition` references with `category` = encounter-diagnosis.

### Step 4: Cross-Reference Medications Against Problems

For each active medication, check if a corresponding condition exists on the active problem list. Use the medication-condition mapping reference.

**Flag Type A -- Medication Without Matching Condition (Implied Diagnosis Missing):**

| Medication / Class | Implied Condition | Check Problem List For |
|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Metformin, glipizide, insulin | Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus | SNOMED 44054006 or ICD-10 E11.x |
| Lisinopril, losartan, amlodipine | Hypertension | SNOMED 59621000 or ICD-10 I10 |
| Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin | Hyperlipidemia | SNOMED 55822004 or ICD-10 E78.x |
| Levothyroxine | Hypothyroidism | SNOMED 40930008 or ICD-10 E03.x |
| Albuterol, fluticasone inhaler | Asthma or COPD | SNOMED 195967001 or 13645005 |
| Sertraline, fluoxetine, escitalopram | Depression or Anxiety | SNOMED 35489007 or 197480006 |
| Omeprazole, pantoprazole | GERD | SNOMED 235595009 or ICD-10 K21.0 |
| Warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban | A-fib, DVT/PE, or valve condition | SNOMED 49436004 |
| Gabapentin, pregabalin | Neuropathy, seizure disorder, or chronic pain | SNOMED 386033004 |
| Methotrexate | Rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis | SNOMED 69896004 |

If medication is present but no matching condition exists on the active problem list, flag as: "Patient is on [medication] but [condition] is not on the active problem list."

### Step 5: Check for Conditions Without Active Treatment

For each active condition, check if there is at least one active medication or recent encounter addressing it.

**Flag Type B -- Untreated Active Condition:**
- Active condition with no medication from the expected drug class
- No encounter in the last 12 months with the condition as a reason code
- Exception: conditions that may not require pharmacotherapy (e.g., obesity managed with lifestyle, resolved fracture under monitoring)

### Step 6: Identify Resolved Conditions Still Listed as Active

**Flag Type C -- Potentially Resolved Conditions:**
- Condition has `clinicalStatus` = active but `abatementDateTime` is in the past
- Condition is an acute diagnosis (e.g., pneumonia, UTI, fracture) with onset > 6 months ago and no recent encounter referencing it
- Condition was treated with a medication that has been stopped

Verify with lab data where applicable:
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Observation"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&code=[relevant-LOINC]&_sort=-date&_count=1"
```

Examples:
- "Diabetes" active but latest HbA1c (LOINC 4548-4) is consistently < 5.7% for 2+ years and no diabetes medications active
- "Hypothyroidism" active but latest TSH (LOINC 3016-3) normal and no levothyroxine prescribed
- "Iron deficiency anemia" active but latest ferritin (LOINC 2276-4) and hemoglobin (LOINC 718-7) both normal

### Step 7: Assess ICD-10 Coding Specificity

For each active condition, check if the ICD-10 code can be made more specific:

**Flag Type D -- Coding Specificity Opportunities:**

| Current Code | Issue | Suggested Improvement |
|-------------|-------|----------------------|
| E11.9 (Type 2 DM without complications) | Patient has documented neuropathy or nephropathy | E11.40 (with neuropathy) or E11.22 (with CKD) |
| I10 (Essential hypertension) | Adequate but check for hypertensive heart/kidney disease | I11.x, I12.x, I13.x if applicable |
| E78.5 (Hyperlipidemia, unspecified) | Can specify type | E78.00 (pure hypercholesterolemia), E78.1 (hypertriglyceridemia) |
| J45.20 (Mild intermittent asthma, uncomplicated) | Patient on daily controller | J45.30 (mild persistent) or higher |
| M17.9 (Osteoarthritis of knee, unspecified) | Laterality missing | M17.11 (right), M17.12 (left) |
| F32.9 (Major depressive disorder, unspecified) | Can specify episode/severity | F32.0 (mild), F32.1 (moderate), F32.2 (severe) |

### Step 8: Format Output

```

## Examples

### Example 1: Routine Problem List Audit

**User says:** "Review the problem list for patient 44321"

**Actions:**
1. `fhir_search` Condition?patient=44321 -- returns 8 conditions (6 active, 2 resolved)
2. `fhir_search` MedicationRequest?patient=44321&status=active -- returns 7 active medications
3. `fhir_search` Encounter?patient=44321&date=ge2025-02-07&_sort=-date -- returns 4 encounters

**Cross-reference findings:**
- Metformin 1000mg and Glipizide 5mg on med list, "Type 2 Diabetes" IS on problem list. OK.
- Lisinopril 20mg on med list, "Hypertension" IS on problem list. OK.
- Omeprazole 20mg on med list, but NO GERD or peptic ulcer on problem list. FLAG A.
- Sertraline 100mg on med list, but NO depression or anxiety on problem list. FLAG A.
- "Acute sinusitis" (J01.90) onset 2025-01-10, still active, no recent encounter. FLAG C.
- Diabetes coded as E11.9 but patient also has documented CKD Stage 3. FLAG D: suggest E11.22.

**Result:** Formatted report with 2 missing diagnoses, 1 potentially resolved condition, 1 coding improvement.

### Example 2: Post-Discharge Problem List Reconciliation

**User says:** "Audit the problem list for patient 77890 after their hospital stay"

**Actions:**
1. `fhir_search` Condition?patient=77890 -- returns 12 conditions
2. `fhir_search` MedicationRequest?patient=77890&status=active -- returns 10 medications
3. `fhir_search` Encounter?patient=77890&date=ge2025-02-07&_sort=-date -- returns 6 encounters including inpatient stay

**Findings:**
- New medications from discharge (apixaban, metoprolol) without corresponding new diagnoses added (atrial fibrillation). FLAG A.
- Hospital-acquired pneumonia on problem list from admission, patient discharged 3 weeks ago with completed antibiotic course. FLAG C.
- "Heart failure" (I50.9, unspecified) could be I50.22 (chronic systolic, compensated) based on echo results. FLAG D.

## Troubleshooting

### Condition Resources Use Only ICD-10 Codes Without SNOMED
- Cross-reference is still possible. Use the ICD-10 code directly for matching.
- Note that some medication-condition mappings are more reliable with SNOMED codes. Use the display text as a fallback for matching.

### MedicationRequest Uses medicationReference Instead of medicationCodeableConcept
- The medication details are in a separate Medication resource. Resolve the reference:
  ```
  Tool: fhir_read
  resourceType: "Medication"
  id: "[medication-reference-id]"
  ```
- Extract the drug name from `Medication.code.coding`.

### Too Many Conditions Returned (Including Historical)
- Filter client-side by `category` = "problem-list-item" to exclude encounter-only diagnoses.
- Sort by `clinicalStatus` to prioritize active conditions.
- If the list exceeds 50 items, paginate with `_count=50` and follow `Bundle.link` where `relation` = "next".
