# Referral Generator

## Overview

Generate a complete specialist referral as a FHIR ServiceRequest resource. Automatically populate the referral with relevant clinical context: active conditions as the reason for referral, pertinent lab results, current medications, and imaging findings. Flag conditions commonly requiring prior authorization. Format the clinical question for the specialist based on referral indication.

## FHIR Resources Used

| Resource | Purpose | Key Fields |
|----------|---------|------------|
| ServiceRequest | The referral itself | status, intent, code, reasonReference, supportingInfo, note |
| Condition | Reason for referral | code, clinicalStatus, onsetDateTime |
| Observation | Supporting lab/vital data | code, valueQuantity, effectiveDateTime, interpretation |
| DiagnosticReport | Imaging and pathology findings | code, conclusion, presentedForm |
| MedicationRequest | Current medications relevant to specialty | medicationCodeableConcept, dosageInstruction, status |
| MedicationStatement | Patient-reported medications | medicationCodeableConcept, status |
| Patient | Demographics and insurance | name, birthDate, gender, identifier |
| Coverage | Insurance for prior auth determination | type, payor, class |
| Procedure | Prior relevant procedures | code, performedDateTime, status |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Patient and Referral Target

Confirm patient identity:
```
Tool: fhir_read
resourceType: "Patient"
id: "[patient-id]"
```

Extract: name, DOB, gender, MRN (from `identifier` where `type.coding.code` = "MR").

### Step 2: Gather Active Conditions

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Condition"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&clinical-status=active"
```

Identify the primary reason for referral from the user's request. Match it to an active Condition. If no matching Condition exists, the referral can still proceed but note that the referring diagnosis should be documented.

### Step 3: Retrieve Relevant Lab Results

Based on the target specialty, search for pertinent labs. Use specialty-specific LOINC codes from `references/referral-indications.md`.

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Observation"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=laboratory&code=[relevant-loinc-codes]&_sort=-date&_count=5"
```

Common specialty-relevant labs:
- **Cardiology**: Troponin (6598-7), BNP (42637-9), lipid panel (57698-3), ECG (11524-6)
- **Endocrinology**: HbA1c (4548-4), TSH (3016-3), free T4 (3024-7), cortisol (2143-6)
- **Nephrology**: Creatinine (2160-0), eGFR (33914-3), urine albumin/creatinine (9318-7), BMP
- **GI**: ALT (1742-6), AST (1920-8), bilirubin (1975-2), lipase (3040-3), albumin (1751-7)
- **Hematology**: CBC (58410-2), reticulocytes (17849-1), ferritin (2276-4), B12 (2132-9)
- **Rheumatology**: ESR (30341-2), CRP (1988-5), ANA (8061-4), RF (11572-5), anti-CCP (53027-9)
- **Pulmonology**: ABG, PFTs, chest imaging
- **Neurology**: MRI brain, EEG, nerve conduction studies
- **Oncology**: tumor markers, pathology, imaging

### Step 4: Retrieve Current Medications

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "MedicationRequest"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active&_sort=-date"
```

Filter medications relevant to the referral specialty. Include all medications if the specialist needs a complete picture (e.g., oncology, rheumatology).

### Step 5: Retrieve Relevant Imaging/Procedures

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "DiagnosticReport"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0074|RAD&_sort=-date&_count=5"
```

Also check for prior procedures relevant to the specialty:
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Procedure"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&code=[relevant-procedure-codes]&_sort=-date&_count=5"
```

### Step 6: Check Insurance and Prior Authorization Flags

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Coverage"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active"
```

Cross-reference the referral type against common prior authorization triggers (see `references/referral-requirements.md`). Flag if prior auth is likely required:
- Most specialist visits under HMO plans
- Advanced imaging (MRI, CT, PET)
- Procedures (endoscopy, biopsy, surgery)
- Infusion therapies (biologics, chemotherapy)
- Genetic testing

### Step 7: Formulate Clinical Question

Based on the referral indication, generate a specific clinical question for the specialist. Avoid vague referrals like "please evaluate."

Structure: "[Clinical context]. [Specific question]. [What has been tried]."

Examples:
- "65yo M with 3 months progressive dyspnea, BNP 890, EF unknown. Please evaluate for heart failure management. Currently on lisinopril 10mg, no diuretic therapy initiated."
- "52yo F with HbA1c 9.8% on metformin 2000mg + glipizide 10mg BID. Requesting assistance with insulin initiation and glucose management optimization."

### Step 8: Create ServiceRequest Resource

```
Tool: fhir_create
resourceType: "ServiceRequest"
resource: {
  "resourceType": "ServiceRequest",
  "status": "active",
  "intent": "order",
  "category": [{ "coding": [{ "system": "http://snomed.info/sct", "code": "3457005", "display": "Patient referral" }] }],
  "priority": "[routine|urgent|asap|stat]",
  "code": { "coding": [{ "system": "http://snomed.info/sct", "code": "[specialty-code]", "display": "[Specialty] referral" }] },
  "subject": { "reference": "Patient/[patient-id]" },
  "authoredOn": "[today-ISO-8601]",
  "reasonReference": [{ "reference": "Condition/[condition-id]" }],
  "supportingInfo": [
    { "reference": "Observation/[lab-id-1]" },
    { "reference": "Observation/[lab-id-2]" },
    { "reference": "DiagnosticReport/[imaging-id]" }
  ],
  "note": [
    { "text": "[Clinical question formulated in Step 7]" },
    { "text": "Current medications: [relevant medication list]" },
    { "text": "Prior authorization: [Required/Not required/Unknown - check with payer]" }
  ]
}
```

```

## Troubleshooting

### No Active Condition Matches the Referral Reason
- Search with broader terms: `Condition?patient=[id]&code:text=[keyword]` if the SNOMED code is unknown.
- If the condition is not yet documented, create it first with `fhir_create` on Condition, then reference it in the ServiceRequest.
- User may describe a symptom rather than a diagnosis. Map common symptoms to SNOMED: chest pain (29857009), abdominal pain (21522001), headache (25064002), dyspnea (267036007).

### Lab Results Not Found for Expected Tests
- The patient may not have had the relevant labs drawn yet. Note "recommended but not yet obtained" in the referral and suggest ordering them.
- Search with `_sort=-date&_count=1` to get the most recent result even if older than expected.
- Some labs may be stored as DiagnosticReport rather than individual Observations. Search DiagnosticReport with the relevant LOINC panel code.

### Insurance Coverage Resource Missing or Incomplete
- Not all FHIR servers store Coverage resources. If unavailable, note "Insurance information not available in FHIR -- verify prior authorization requirements with front desk."
- Self-pay patients: note "Self-pay -- no prior authorization required, discuss cost with specialist office."
