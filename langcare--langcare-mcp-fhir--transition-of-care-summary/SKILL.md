## Instructions

### Step 1: Retrieve Patient Demographics

```
Tool: fhir_read
resourceType: "Patient"
id: "[patient-id]"
```

Extract: full legal name, DOB, age, gender, MRN, address, phone, preferred language, emergency contacts (from `contact` array or RelatedPerson search).

### Step 2: Retrieve Encounter Information

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Encounter"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&_sort=-date&_count=1"
```

Extract: encounter type (inpatient, observation, ED), admission date, discharge date (if available), reason for admission from `reasonCode`, attending provider from `participant`, discharge disposition from `hospitalization.dischargeDisposition`.

### Step 3: Retrieve Active Problem List

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Condition"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&clinical-status=active"
```

Organize by:
- **Principal diagnosis**: The primary reason for the encounter
- **Active problems**: All other active conditions
- **Hospital-acquired conditions**: Conditions with onset during the encounter period
- Include SNOMED or ICD-10 codes, onset dates, and verification status

### Step 4: Retrieve Medication Lists

Discharge medications:
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "MedicationRequest"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active&intent=order"
```

Home medication list for comparison:
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "MedicationStatement"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active"
```

For each medication, extract: name, dose, route, frequency, prescriber, start date. Flag:
- **NEW**: Medications started during encounter
- **CHANGED**: Medications with dose or frequency modifications
- **DISCONTINUED**: Medications intentionally stopped (search MedicationRequest with `status=stopped` or `status=cancelled`)
- **CONTINUED**: Medications unchanged from pre-admission

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "MedicationRequest"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=stopped,cancelled&encounter=[encounter-id]"
```

### Step 5: Retrieve Allergies

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "AllergyIntolerance"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]"
```

Include: allergen, reaction type, severity, criticality. If zero results, document as "No Known Allergies (NKA)" or "Allergy status not reviewed" (these are clinically different).

### Step 6: Retrieve Procedures Performed

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Procedure"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&date=ge=[encounter-start-date]&status=completed"
```

Include: procedure name with code, date performed, performer, outcome/findings. For surgical procedures, include anesthesia type and complications if documented.

### Step 7: Retrieve Recent Results

Lab results:
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Observation"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=laboratory&date=ge=[encounter-start-date]&_sort=-date"
```

Imaging results:
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "DiagnosticReport"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&date=ge=[encounter-start-date]&_sort=-date"
```

Flag any results with status `preliminary` or `registered` as PENDING. Include interpretation flags for abnormal values.

### Step 8: Retrieve Most Recent Vitals

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Observation"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=vital-signs&_sort=-date&_count=10"
```

Extract the most recent value for: BP (85354-9), HR (8867-4), RR (9279-1), Temp (8310-5), SpO2 (2708-6), Weight (29463-7).

### Step 9: Check Advance Directives and Code Status

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Consent"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/consentcategorycodes|acd"
```

Also check for resuscitation status:
```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Consent"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/consentcategorycodes|dnr"
```

If no Consent resources found, check Condition for code status documentation (some systems store as Observation or flag).

### Step 10: Retrieve Pending Orders and Follow-up Needs

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "ServiceRequest"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active,draft"
```

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "CarePlan"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=active"
```

Identify: pending labs awaiting results, scheduled follow-up appointments, home health orders, DME orders, referrals in progress.

### Step 11: Retrieve Immunization History

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Immunization"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&status=completed&_sort=-date"
```

Include recent immunizations (administered during encounter) and relevant historical immunizations (pneumococcal, influenza, COVID-19, tetanus).

### Step 12: Retrieve Functional Status

```
Tool: fhir_search
resourceType: "Observation"
queryParams: "patient=[patient-id]&category=survey&_sort=-date&_count=5"
```

Look for: ADL assessments, mobility status, cognitive assessments (MMSE, MoCA), fall risk, Braden scale.

### Step 13: Create DocumentReference

```
Tool: fhir_create
resourceType: "DocumentReference"
resource: {
  "resourceType": "DocumentReference",
  "status": "current",
  "type": { "coding": [{ "system": "http://loinc.org", "code": "18761-7", "display": "Transfer summary note" }] },
  "category": [{ "coding": [{ "system": "http://loinc.org", "code": "18842-5", "display": "Discharge summary" }] }],
  "subject": { "reference": "Patient/[patient-id]" },
  "date": "[current-timestamp]",
  "author": [{ "reference": "Practitioner/[author-id]" }],
  "description": "Transition of Care Summary",
  "content": [{ "attachment": { "contentType": "text/plain", "data": "[base64-encoded-summary]" } }],
  "context": { "encounter": [{ "reference": "Encounter/[encounter-id]" }] }
}
```

### Step 14: Format Output

## Troubleshooting

### Encounter Resource Missing Key Fields
- Not all FHIR servers populate `hospitalization.dischargeDisposition` or `reasonCode`. Check the Condition list for the principal diagnosis and ask the user for discharge disposition if not in the Encounter resource.
- If `participant` (attending provider) is empty, check ServiceRequest or Procedure resources for a performer reference.

### Medication Reconciliation Discrepancies Between MedicationRequest and MedicationStatement
- MedicationStatement represents what the patient reports taking. MedicationRequest represents what was prescribed. Discrepancies are expected and clinically significant.
- Present both lists and flag discrepancies. The TOC should clearly indicate which list is "discharge medications" (MedicationRequest with `intent=order`, `status=active`) vs "home medications prior to admission" (MedicationStatement).

### No Advance Directive or Code Status Found
- Code status may be stored differently across systems: as Consent, as a flag on the Patient resource, as an Observation, or only in clinical notes.
- If not found in structured data, note "Code status not documented in structured data -- verify with clinical team before transfer."
- This is a Joint Commission requirement for TOC. Flag it prominently if missing.
