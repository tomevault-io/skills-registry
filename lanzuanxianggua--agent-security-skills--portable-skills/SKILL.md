# Portable Skills — Cross-Agent Skill Standard

<default_to_action>
When creating or converting skills for cross-agent compatibility:
1. VALIDATE the skill against the universal schema before packaging
2. TEST on at least 2 target agents to confirm compatibility
3. CONVERT using the appropriate adapter for each target platform
4. DOCUMENT platform-specific behaviors and limitations
5. PACKAGE with a manifest that declares compatibility

**Quick Compatibility Check:**
- Does the skill use only universal frontmatter fields?
- Are all tool references abstracted or conditionally mapped?
- Is the skill self-contained (no external deps beyond standard tools)?
- Does it include trigger descriptions for each platform?
- Is there a fallback for unsupported features?

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Write once, deploy everywhere — no manual edits per platform
- Graceful degradation — features that don't map should degrade, not break
- Backward compatibility — skills written today must work on older agent versions
- Clear manifest — declare what works and what doesn't on each platform
</default_to_action>

## When to Use

- Creating new skills that should work across multiple AI coding agents
- Converting existing Claude Code skills for use in Cursor, Windsurf, or Copilot
- Building a skill marketplace or registry that serves multiple platforms
- Establishing team-wide skill standards that work regardless of tool choice
- Publishing skills to the open Agent Skills ecosystem

## The Universal Skill Format

### Directory Structure
```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Primary skill definition (universal)
├── manifest.json         # Compatibility manifest
├── references/           # Supporting documentation
│   └── *.md
├── schemas/              # Output schemas (optional)
│   └── output.json
└── scripts/              # Tool scripts (optional)
    └── *.sh / *.json
```

### SKILL.md Universal Frontmatter
```yaml
---
# === Universal Fields (all agents) ===
name: my-skill                    # Required — kebab-case identifier

category: security                # Optional — categorization
priority: high                    # Optional — low, medium, high, critical
tags: [security, audit]           # Optional — discoverability tags

### Platform File Locations

| Platform | Skill Location | Format |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Markdown with frontmatter |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc` | Markdown with frontmatter |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` or `.windsurf/rules/<name>.md` | Markdown with frontmatter |
| Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Markdown (flat, no frontmatter) |
| Aider | `.aider.conf.yml` + conventions in `.aider/` | YAML + Markdown |
| Agent Skills (open) | `.agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Markdown with frontmatter |

## Conversion Rules

### Claude Code → Cursor
```
Transforms:
- SKILL.md → .cursor/rules/<name>.mdc
- frontmatter name → rule name header
- frontmatter triggers → .mdc globs/description fields
- references/ → inline at bottom of file
- schemas/ → drop (not supported)
- scripts/ → keep bash scripts, reference from body

CLI: ./scripts/convert.sh --input ./my-skill/ --target cursor
```

### Claude Code → Windsurf
```
Transforms:
- SKILL.md → .windsurf/rules/<name>.md
- frontmatter preserved as YAML comment block
- references/ → inline at bottom
- schemas/ → drop
- scripts/ → keep bash scripts

CLI: ./scripts/convert.sh --input ./my-skill/ --target windsurf
```

### Claude Code → Copilot
```
Transforms:
- SKILL.md → .github/copilot-instructions.md (appended)
- frontmatter → stripped, description becomes heading
- triggers → added as "When to use" section
- references/ → inline as sections
- schemas/, scripts/ → drop
- Tool-specific instructions → commented out with note

CLI: ./scripts/convert.sh --input ./my-skill/ --target copilot
```

### Universal → Any Platform
```
The universal format is a superset. Conversion to any platform:
1. Parse SKILL.md frontmatter
2. Map trigger syntax to target platform
3. Inline references into body if target doesn't support references/
4. Strip platform-incompatible sections (mark as comments)
5. Generate target file at correct location
6. Write manifest.json with conversion metadata

CLI: ./scripts/convert.sh --input ./my-skill/ --target all
```

## Manifest Schema

Every portable skill MUST include a `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-skill",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What this skill does",
  "author": "your-name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "sourceFormat": "universal",
  "compatibility": {
    "claude-code": { "status": "full", "minVersion": "1.0.0" },
    "cursor": { "status": "full", "minVersion": "0.45" },
    "windsurf": { "status": "full", "minVersion": "1.0" },
    "copilot": { "status": "partial", "notes": "No schema support" },
    "aider": { "status": "experimental", "notes": "Basic support only" }
  },
  "files": {
    "skill": "SKILL.md",
    "manifest": "manifest.json",
    "references": ["references/*.md"],
    "schemas": ["schemas/*.json"],
    "scripts": ["scripts/*"]
  },
  "conversions": {
    "cursor": { "output": ".cursor/rules/<name>.mdc", "transform": "mdc" },
    "windsurf": { "output": ".windsurf/rules/<name>.md", "transform": "windsurf" },
    "copilot": { "output": ".github/copilot-instructions.md", "transform": "append" }
  }
}
```

## Writing Portable Skills — Best Practices

### DO
- Use only universal frontmatter fields (`name`, `description`, `category`, `tags`)
- Keep the SKILL.md body as pure Markdown
- Use `<default_to_action>` blocks for behavioral instructions
- Include platform-specific sections as clearly marked blocks
- Test on at least Claude Code + one other agent before publishing
- Provide a `manifest.json` declaring compatibility
- Use Bash for scripts (universal across all agents)

### DON'T
- Use agent-specific tool calls in the main skill body without alternatives
- Rely on frontmatter features only one agent supports
- Hard-code file paths specific to one platform
- Use HTML or non-standard Markdown extensions
- Assume any specific directory structure beyond SKILL.md at root

### Graceful Degradation Pattern
```markdown
## Advanced Features

<agent:claude-code>
This skill supports parallel agent dispatch for faster scanning:
\`\`\`typescript
await Agent({ prompt: "scan code for injection", subagent_type: "Explore" })
\`\`\`
</agent:claude-code>

<agent:universal>
For advanced parallel scanning, use your agent's task delegation feature
to run multiple scan passes simultaneously.
</agent:universal>
```

## Conversion CLI (convert.sh)

The conversion tool is at `scripts/convert.sh` in the project root.

```bash
# Convert a single skill
./scripts/convert.sh --input ./skills/code-guard/ --target cursor

# Convert all skills in a directory
./scripts/convert.sh --input ./skills/ --target all --output ./converted/

# Validate a skill's portability
./scripts/convert.sh --validate ./skills/code-guard/

# Check compatibility matrix
./scripts/convert.sh --check ./skills/code-guard/ --platform windsurf
```

## Guardrails

- NEVER publish a skill as "compatible" without testing on the target platform
- ALWAYS include a fallback for platform-specific features
- ALWAYS version your skills semantically in manifest.json
- NEVER silently drop content during conversion — log what was removed
- ALWAYS validate the output of conversion against the target's expected format
- Test edge cases: empty references, missing manifest, platform-specific frontmatter
