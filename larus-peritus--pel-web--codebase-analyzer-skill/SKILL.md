# Codebase Analyzer Skill

## Purpose

You are an expert code archaeologist. Your goal is to analyze existing code in `apps/[app-name]/` and reverse-engineer complete specifications: requirements (what it does), design (how it works), and implementation status (what's done, what's missing).

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- User has existing code without documentation
- User wants to refactor legacy code with spec-driven development
- User needs to understand what has been implemented
- User mentions: "analyze code", "reverse engineer", "document existing", "understand codebase", "what's implemented"

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Scope

Ask the user:
```markdown
📊 CODEBASE ANALYSIS

I'll analyze your existing code and generate specs for spec-driven development.

What would you like me to analyze?
A) Entire app: apps/[app-name]/
B) Specific feature/module
C) Specific files (provide paths)

Do you have:
- Development logs?
- Existing documentation?
- Test files?
- Commit history to reference?

This will help me understand the implementation better.
```

### Step 2: Analyze Code Structure

**Directory Analysis**:
```bash
# List all files in the app
find apps/[app-name]/src -type f

# Identify structure
ls -R apps/[app-name]/src/

# Count files by type
find apps/[app-name] -type f | wc -l
```

**Report structure**:
```markdown
📁 Code Structure Analysis

Apps/[app-name]/
├── src/ - [X] files
│   ├── components/ - [Y] files
│   ├── services/ - [Z] files
│   ├── models/ - [N] files
│   └── utils/ - [M] files
├── tests/ - [T] test files
└── [other directories]

Languages: [TypeScript, Python, etc.]
Framework: [React, FastAPI, etc.]
Database: [PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.]
```

### Step 3: Identify Features Implemented

**Read key files**:
```
Read: apps/[app-name]/src/index.ts (or main entry point)
Read: apps/[app-name]/src/routes.ts (or routing file)
Read: apps/[app-name]/package.json (or dependencies file)
```

**Parse for features**:
- Routes/endpoints → user-facing features
- Components → UI features
- Services → business logic features
- Models → data features
- Tests → tested functionality

**Report features**:
```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 FEATURES IDENTIFIED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. User Authentication
   - Files: src/auth/, src/components/Login.tsx
   - Routes: /login, /register, /logout
   - Tests: ✅ auth.test.ts (12 tests)
   - Status: ✅ Implemented

2. Recipe Creation
   - Files: src/recipes/, src/components/RecipeForm.tsx
   - Routes: /recipes/create, /recipes/:id
   - Tests: ⚠️ Partial (6/10 tests)
   - Status: 🔶 Partially Implemented

3. Search Functionality
   - Files: src/search/, src/components/SearchBar.tsx
   - Routes: /search
   - Tests: ❌ No tests found
   - Status: 🔶 Implemented but Untested

4. Admin Dashboard
   - Files: None found
   - Routes: None
   - Tests: None
   - Status: ❌ Not Implemented (mentioned in docs)

Total Features Found: 3 implemented, 1 planned
```

### Step 4: Analyze Architecture & Design

**Read architecture-critical files**:
```
Read: apps/[app-name]/src/config.ts
Read: apps/[app-name]/src/database.ts
Read: apps/[app-name]/src/api/index.ts
```

**Identify patterns**:
- Architecture: MVC, Microservices, Layered, etc.
- Data flow: REST, GraphQL, WebSockets
- State management: Redux, Context API, Zustand
- Error handling: Try-catch, error boundaries, middleware
- Security: Authentication, authorization, validation

**Report architecture**:
```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🏗️ ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Pattern: Layered Architecture (MVC)
- Controllers: src/controllers/
- Services: src/services/
- Models: src/models/
- Views: src/components/

Technology Stack:
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript
- Backend: Express.js + Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL (pg library)
- Auth: JWT (jsonwebtoken)
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library

Data Flow:
Client → Routes → Controllers → Services → Models → Database

Key Design Decisions:
✅ Separation of concerns (good)
✅ Dependency injection in services
⚠️ Limited error handling in controllers
⚠️ No input validation middleware
❌ No API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
```

### Step 5: Read Development Logs (if provided)

If user provided logs or documentation:
```
Read: [provided-log-file]
Read: [provided-docs]
```

**Extract from logs**:
- Development timeline
- Known issues
- Incomplete features
- Technical debt
- Future plans

### Step 6: Identify Gaps & Missing Pieces

**Compare what exists vs what should exist**:
```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 GAPS IDENTIFIED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Missing Implementation:
❌ Admin Dashboard (mentioned in routes.ts but not built)
❌ Email notifications (service stub exists, not implemented)
❌ Image upload (component exists, backend missing)

Missing Tests:
⚠️ Search functionality - no tests
⚠️ Recipe creation - partial coverage (60%)
⚠️ User profiles - no integration tests

Technical Debt:
⚠️ Error handling - inconsistent patterns
⚠️ Input validation - missing in several endpoints
⚠️ API documentation - none
⚠️ Logging - minimal, needs structured logging

Security Concerns:
🔴 Password reset - no rate limiting
🔴 File upload - no size/type validation
🔴 SQL queries - potential injection risk in search

Performance Issues:
⚠️ N+1 queries in recipe listing
⚠️ No caching layer
⚠️ Large bundle size (3.2MB)
```

### Step 7: Generate Requirements Spec

**Create `apps/[app-name]/specs/[feature]-requirements.md`**:

Based on code analysis, reverse-engineer requirements using EARS format:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] - Requirements

**Status**: ✅ Implemented | 🔶 Partial | ❌ Missing

## Overview

[What the code does - inferred from implementation]

## User Stories

[Derived from routes, components, and functionality]

### Story 1: [Feature Name]

**As a** [user type inferred from code]
**I want** [functionality that exists]
**So that** [benefit inferred from context]

## Functional Requirements

[EARS format based on what code actually does]

### REQ-1: [Requirement Title]
**WHEN** [condition found in code]
**THEN** the system SHALL [behavior implemented]

**Status**: ✅ Implemented in: src/[file].ts

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
[Inferred from code patterns]

### Security
[Inferred from auth, validation, etc.]

### Usability
[Inferred from UI components]

## Testing Requirements

**Current Test Coverage**: [X]%
- Unit Tests: [coverage]
- Integration Tests: [coverage]
- E2E Tests: [coverage]

## Known Issues

[From logs, TODOs, or analysis]

## Missing Functionality

[Gap analysis results]
```

### Step 8: Generate Design Spec

**Create `apps/[app-name]/specs/[feature]-design.md`**:

Document the actual design from code:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] - Design

**Status**: Reverse-engineered from implementation

## System Overview

[Architecture diagram in text form]

## Components

### [Component Name]

**Location**: src/components/[Component].tsx

**Purpose**: [Inferred from code]

**Responsibilities**:
- [What it does]
- [How it integrates]

**Dependencies**:
- [Other components/services it uses]

**Interfaces**:
```typescript
[Actual interfaces/types from code]
```

## Data Models

[Extracted from code - actual schemas, types, models]

## API Design

### Endpoints

[Extracted from routes]

### Request/Response

[Extracted from controllers]

## Error Handling

[Patterns found in code]

## Security

[Auth mechanisms found]

## Testing Strategy

[What tests exist, what's missing]

## Technical Debt

[Issues identified during analysis]
```

### Step 9: Generate Tasks/Refactoring Plan

**Create `apps/[app-name]/specs/[feature]-tasks.md`**:

```markdown

## Best Practices

### Analysis Depth

**Quick Analysis** (30 minutes):
- Directory structure
- Main files only
- High-level features
- Critical issues

**Deep Analysis** (2-3 hours):
- All source files
- Test coverage
- Architecture patterns
- Technical debt
- Performance analysis
- Security audit

### Handling Different Codebases

**Well-Structured Code**:
- Easy to identify features
- Clear separation of concerns
- Good test coverage
→ Generate detailed, accurate specs

**Legacy/Messy Code**:
- Unclear structure
- Mixed concerns
- No tests
→ Document "as-is", mark areas needing refactoring

**Partial Implementation**:
- Some features done, some stubbed
- Mixed quality
→ Separate implemented vs planned in specs

### Working with Logs

If user provides logs:
```
Read: [log-file]

Extract:
- Development timeline
- Feature implementation order
- Known issues
- Developer notes
- TODO items
```

Use this to enrich specs with context.

## Integration with Other Skills

### After Analysis

1. **Use builder-skill** to implement missing tasks
2. **Use spec-orchestrator-skill** for new features
3. **Use worktree-manager-skill** for isolated refactoring

### Before Implementation

Always analyze first if:
- Code exists but no docs
- Refactoring needed
- Understanding legacy system

## Tips for Users

**Provide Context**:
- Development logs help immensely
- Commit history can show evolution
- Tests reveal intended behavior
- Documentation (even partial) clarifies intent

**Be Specific**:
- "Analyze entire app" vs "Analyze auth module"
- Point to specific files for focused analysis
- Mention known issues or areas of concern

**Review & Refine**:
- Generated specs are inferred, not perfect
- Review requirements for accuracy
- Correct any misunderstood functionality
- Add missing context

## Limitations

**Cannot Infer**:
- Business requirements not evident in code
- User stories beyond what's implemented
- Design rationale (only current state)
- Future plans (unless in comments/docs)

**Best Effort**:
- Test coverage calculation (approximation)
- Feature completeness (based on visible code)
- Security analysis (not a full audit)
- Performance issues (static analysis only)

## Report Format

Always provide:
1. **Structure**: What exists
2. **Features**: What's implemented
3. **Architecture**: How it works
4. **Gaps**: What's missing
5. **Specs**: Generated documentation
6. **Next Steps**: Recommended actions
