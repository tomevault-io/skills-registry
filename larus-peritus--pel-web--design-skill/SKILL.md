# Technical Design

Transform approved requirements into comprehensive technical designs that guide implementation.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Moving from requirements phase to design phase
- The user mentions "design", "architecture", "technical approach", or "components"
- Need to translate requirements into technical specifications
- Planning system architecture, data models, or APIs
- Making technology and framework decisions

## Prerequisites

**Required**:
- Completed and approved requirements document
- Clear understanding of what needs to be built

**Optional** (improves design quality):
- Existing system architecture (if extending)
- Technology stack constraints
- Performance and scale requirements
- Team skill levels and preferences

## Workflow

### Step 1: Review and Analyze Requirements

**Load the requirements document** and analyze:

1. **Functional Requirements**: What features must be built?
2. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability needs?
3. **User Interactions**: What are the user workflows?
4. **Integration Points**: What external systems are involved?
5. **Constraints**: Technical, business, or compliance limitations?

**Extract key design drivers**:
- Critical features that drive architecture decisions
- Performance requirements that affect technology choices
- Security needs that shape component design
- Scale requirements that influence infrastructure choices

### Step 2: Research and Build Context

**Identify research needs**:
- Are there unfamiliar technologies or patterns to learn?
- Do we need to understand third-party APIs?
- Should we review best practices for this type of system?
- Are there compliance or security standards to research?

**Conduct targeted research**:
- Use docs-scraper agent for official documentation
- Research architectural patterns relevant to requirements
- Investigate technology options and their trade-offs
- Review security and performance best practices

**Document key findings**:
- Summarize insights that inform design decisions
- Note pros/cons of different approaches
- Include relevant links and sources
- Keep research focused on actionable insights

### Step 3: Design System Architecture

**Create high-level architecture**:

1. **System Overview**: Describe how the system works at the highest level
2. **Component Architecture**: Identify major components and their responsibilities
3. **Data Flow**: Show how information moves through the system
4. **Integration Points**: Define how system connects to external services
5. **Technology Stack**: Choose technologies with rationale

**Architecture Pattern**:
```markdown
## Architecture

### System Overview
[Describe the overall approach and key architectural decisions]

### Component Architecture
**[Component Name]**
- Purpose: [What this component does]
- Responsibilities: [Key functions]
- Technology: [Chosen tech and why]

### Data Flow
1. [Step 1 of data flow]
2. [Step 2 of data flow]
3. [Step 3 of data flow]

### Technology Decisions
**[Technology/Framework]**: [Rationale for choosing]
```

### Step 4: Define Components and Interfaces

**For each major component**:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this component solve?
2. **Responsibilities**: What are its specific duties?
3. **Interfaces**: How do other components interact with it?
4. **Dependencies**: What does this component need?
5. **Implementation Notes**: Key technical considerations

**Component Pattern**:
```markdown
### [Component Name]

**Purpose**: [Single sentence description]

**Responsibilities**:
- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]
- [Responsibility 3]

**Public Interface**:
- `functionName(params): returnType` - [What it does]
- `anotherFunction(params): returnType` - [What it does]

**Dependencies**:
- [Dependency 1]: [Why needed]
- [Dependency 2]: [Why needed]

**Implementation Notes**:
- [Key technical consideration]
- [Important pattern or approach]
```

### Step 5: Design Data Models

**Define all data structures**:

1. **Entity Definitions**: Core data structures and their properties
2. **Relationships**: How entities relate to each other
3. **Validation Rules**: Data integrity and business rules
4. **Storage Strategy**: How data will be persisted and accessed

**Data Model Pattern**:
```markdown
### [Entity Name]

**Properties**:
- `propertyName`: `Type` - [Description, constraints]
- `anotherProperty`: `Type` - [Description, constraints]

**Validation Rules**:
- [Rule 1]: [Validation logic]
- [Rule 2]: [Validation logic]

**Relationships**:
- [Relationship to other entity]

**Storage**:
- [How this will be persisted]
- [Indexing strategy if relevant]
```

### Step 6: Plan Error Handling Strategy

**Define error handling approach**:

1. **Error Categories**: Types of errors the system might encounter
2. **Error Responses**: How system responds to each error type
3. **User Communication**: How errors are presented to users
4. **Logging Strategy**: What gets logged and where
5. **Recovery Mechanisms**: How system recovers from errors

**Error Handling Pattern**:
```markdown
## Error Handling

### Error Categories
**Validation Errors**: User input doesn't meet requirements
- Response: 400 Bad Request with specific field errors
- User Message: "Please correct the following fields..."

**Authentication Errors**: User not authenticated or authorized
- Response: 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden
- User Message: "Please log in to continue"

**System Errors**: Database, network, or service failures
- Response: 500 Internal Server Error
- User Message: "Something went wrong. Please try again"
- Logging: Full error details, stack trace, context
```

### Step 7: Define Testing Strategy

**Plan testing approach**:

1. **Unit Testing**: What components need unit tests?
2. **Integration Testing**: What integrations need testing?
3. **End-to-End Testing**: What user flows need validation?
4. **Testing Tools**: What frameworks and tools to use?
5. **Coverage Goals**: What level of coverage is needed?

**Testing Strategy Pattern**:
```markdown
## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test all business logic in service layer
- Test data validation in model layer
- Framework: Jest with 80% coverage goal

### Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints with real database
- Test external service integrations with mocks
- Framework: Supertest with test database

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflows
- Test critical paths: [list critical paths]
- Framework: Playwright for browser testing
```

### Step 8: Document Design Decisions

**For significant decisions**:

**Decision Record Pattern**:
```markdown
### Decision: [Brief title]

**Context**: [What situation requires a decision?]

**Options Considered**:
1. **[Option 1]**
   - Pros: [Benefits]
   - Cons: [Drawbacks]
   - Risk: [Implementation risks]

2. **[Option 2]**
   - Pros: [Benefits]
   - Cons: [Drawbacks]
   - Risk: [Implementation risks]

**Decision**: [Chosen option]

**Rationale**: [Why this option was selected based on requirements and constraints]

**Implications**: [What this means for implementation, performance, maintenance]

**Requirements Addressed**: [Reference specific requirements]
```

### Step 9: Validate Design Against Requirements

**Traceability check**:
- [ ] Every requirement has corresponding design element
- [ ] All user workflows are addressed in components
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are satisfied by design
- [ ] Error cases from requirements are handled in design
- [ ] Integration points match requirement specifications

**Quality check**:
- [ ] Components have clear, single responsibilities
- [ ] Interfaces are well-defined
- [ ] Data models support all required operations
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Testing strategy covers all critical functionality

**Feasibility check**:
- [ ] Design is technically achievable
- [ ] Performance requirements can be met
- [ ] Security requirements are addressed
- [ ] Design fits within constraints
- [ ] Team can implement with available skills

### Step 10: Document and Save

**Structure the design document**:
```markdown
# Design Document: [Feature Name]

## Overview
[High-level summary and approach]

## Architecture
[System architecture and components]

## Components and Interfaces
[Detailed component descriptions]

## Data Models
[Data structures and relationships]

## Error Handling
[Error strategy and responses]

## Testing Strategy
[Testing approach and tools]

## Design Decisions
[Key decisions with rationale]

## Implementation Considerations
[Notes for developers]

## Requirements Traceability
[Map design elements to requirements]
```

**Save location**: `specs/design-[feature-name].md`

### Step 11: Request Approval

Before proceeding to tasks phase:
- Present complete design document
- Highlight key architectural decisions
- Show traceability to requirements
- Ask for explicit approval: "Does this design satisfy the requirements?"
- Address any questions or concerns
- Only proceed to tasks after design is approved

## Reference Documentation

For detailed guidance, see:
- [Architecture Patterns](ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md) - Common patterns and when to use them
- [Decision Templates](DECISION_TEMPLATES.md) - Frameworks for making design decisions
- [Examples](EXAMPLES.md) - Complete design document examples
- [Kiro Design Phase](../../kiro/spec-process-guide/process/design-phase.md) - Full methodology

## Common Design Patterns

### RESTful API Design
- Resource-based endpoints
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Proper status codes
- JSON request/response format

### Service Layer Pattern
- Controller handles HTTP concerns
- Service layer contains business logic
- Repository layer handles data access
- Clear separation of concerns

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Components communicate via events
- Loose coupling between services
- Async processing for non-critical operations
- Event store for audit trail

## Best Practices

**Do**:
- ✅ Design for the requirements you have, not imagined future needs
- ✅ Keep components focused with single responsibilities
- ✅ Define clear interfaces between components
- ✅ Document rationale for major decisions
- ✅ Consider error cases and edge conditions
- ✅ Plan for testing from the start

**Don't**:
- ❌ Over-engineer or add unnecessary complexity
- ❌ Skip error handling planning
- ❌ Ignore non-functional requirements
- ❌ Choose technologies without rationale
- ❌ Create components with unclear boundaries
- ❌ Forget to trace design back to requirements

## Next Steps

After design is complete and approved:
1. **Proceed to Tasks Phase**: Use tasks-skill or tasks-agent
2. **Break Down Implementation**: Create actionable development tasks
3. **Maintain Design-Task Alignment**: Ensure tasks implement design
4. **Keep Design Updated**: Revise if tasks reveal issues
5. **Consider Worktree** (Optional): Create isolated worktree for implementation

Design provides the technical roadmap. The tasks phase will break it into actionable steps.
