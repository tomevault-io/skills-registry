# jj-hunk: Programmatic Hunk Selection

Use `jj-hunk` for non-interactive hunk selection in jj. Essential for AI agents that need to create clean, logical commits from mixed changes.

## When to Use This Skill

- Splitting a commit into multiple logical commits
- Committing only specific hunks (partial commit)
- Squashing only certain changes into parent
- Any hunk selection that would normally require `jj split -i` or `jj squash -i`

## Setup

```bash
cargo install jj-hunk
```

Add to `~/.jjconfig.toml`:
```toml
[merge-tools.jj-hunk]
program = "jj-hunk"
edit-args = ["select", "$left", "$right"]
```

## Core Workflow

### 1. List Hunks

```bash
jj-hunk list              # working copy (@)
jj-hunk list -r <rev>     # any revision
```

Output (JSON):
```json
{
  "src/foo.rs": [
    {"index": 0, "type": "replace", "removed": "old\n", "added": "new\n"},
    {"index": 1, "type": "insert", "removed": "", "added": "// added\n"}
  ],
  "src/bar.rs": [
    {"index": 0, "type": "delete", "removed": "removed\n", "added": ""}
  ]
}
```

### 2. Build a Spec

Select hunks by index or use file-level actions:

```json
{
  "files": {
    "src/foo.rs": {"hunks": [0]},
    "src/bar.rs": {"action": "keep"},
    "src/baz.rs": {"action": "reset"}
  },
  "default": "reset"
}
```

| Spec | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `{"hunks": [0, 2]}` | Include only hunks 0 and 2 |
| `{"action": "keep"}` | Include all changes |
| `{"action": "reset"}` | Discard all changes |
| `"default": "reset"` | Unlisted files are discarded |
| `"default": "keep"` | Unlisted files are kept |

### 3. Execute

```bash
# Split: selected hunks → first commit, rest → second commit
jj-hunk split '<spec>' "commit message"
jj-hunk split -r <rev> '<spec>' "commit message"  # split any revision

# Commit: selected hunks committed, rest stays in working copy
jj-hunk commit '<spec>' "commit message"

# Squash: selected hunks squashed into parent
jj-hunk squash '<spec>'
jj-hunk squash -r <rev> '<spec>'  # squash any revision into its parent
```

## Examples

### Split Mixed Changes into Logical Commits

You have refactoring and a new feature mixed together:

```bash
# 1. See what hunks exist
jj-hunk list

# 2. Split out the refactoring first
jj-hunk split '{"files": {"src/lib.rs": {"hunks": [0, 1]}}, "default": "reset"}' \
  "refactor: extract helper function"

# 3. Remaining changes become second commit
jj describe -m "feat: add new feature"
```

### Commit Only Part of Your Changes

Keep experimental code in working copy while committing the fix:

```bash
jj-hunk commit '{"files": {"src/bug.rs": {"action": "keep"}}, "default": "reset"}' \
  "fix: handle null case"
```

### Squash Specific Files into Parent

```bash
jj-hunk squash '{"files": {"src/tests.rs": {"action": "keep"}}, "default": "reset"}'
```

### Keep Everything Except One File

```bash
jj-hunk split '{"files": {"src/wip.rs": {"action": "reset"}}, "default": "keep"}' \
  "feat: complete implementation"
```

### Split a Non-Working-Copy Revision

```bash
# List hunks in a specific revision
jj-hunk list -r urx

# Split it — examples go to first commit, rest stays
jj-hunk split -r urx \
  '{"files": {"examples/README.md": {"action": "keep"}}, "default": "reset"}' \
  "examples of extensions"
```

## Direct jj --tool Usage

The commands above are wrappers. For direct control:

```bash
# Write spec to file
echo '{"files": {"src/foo.rs": {"hunks": [0]}}, "default": "reset"}' > /tmp/spec.json

# Run jj with the tool
JJ_HUNK_SELECTION=/tmp/spec.json jj split -i --tool=jj-hunk -m "message"
```

## Hunk Types

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `insert` | New lines added |
| `delete` | Lines removed |
| `replace` | Lines changed (removed + added) |

## Tips

- **Always list first**: Run `jj-hunk list` to see hunk indices before building specs
- **Use default wisely**: `"default": "reset"` is safer (explicit inclusion), `"default": "keep"` is convenient for excluding specific files
- **Combine with jj**: After splitting, use `jj describe` to refine commit messages
