**Review Scope (optional):** "$ARGUMENTS"

---

## Phase 0: Determine Scope & Context

1. Parse arguments to identify requested review aspects and target:
   - `help` — Display all available scopes and usage, then stop
   - `security` — Security-focused vulnerability assessment
   - `simplify` — Code simplification for clarity and maintainability
   - `review` — General code review for bugs, patterns, CLAUDE.md compliance
   - `debug` — Systematic debugging of a specific issue
   - `types` — Type design analysis (encapsulation, invariants, enforcement)
   - `errors` — Silent failure hunting and error handling audit
   - `architect` — Architecture analysis and implementation blueprint
   - `custom` — User-defined review focus; remaining arguments specify the
     criteria (e.g. `custom "check for N+1 queries in src/repositories/"`)
   - `all` — Run all applicable reviews (default)
   - A file path, directory, or PR number as target

   If scope is `help`, print this list and exit without running any review
   phases.

2. Gather context:

   ```
   git status
   git diff --name-only origin/HEAD... 2>/dev/null || git diff --name-only HEAD~1
   git log --oneline -10
   ```

3. Identify the language(s) in scope and apply language-specific expertise:
   - **Python**: PEP 8, type hints, dataclasses/pydantic, async patterns, pytest
     conventions
   - **Swift**: Protocol-oriented design, value types vs reference types, memory
     management, Concurrency (async/await)
   - **TypeScript**: Strict mode, discriminated unions, utility types, ES module
     patterns
   - **Dart**: Null safety, freezed/riverpod patterns, Flutter widget lifecycle
   - **Rust**: Ownership/borrowing, lifetime annotations, Result/Option
     patterns, unsafe blocks
   - **Ruby**: Duck typing discipline, Rails conventions, frozen_string_literal,
     RSpec patterns
   - **Java**: Generics, checked exceptions, concurrency (java.util.concurrent),
     Spring/Jakarta conventions, GC tuning awareness
   - **C**: Memory safety, buffer bounds, pointer arithmetic, undefined
     behavior, resource cleanup
   - **C++**: RAII, smart pointers, move semantics, template safety, STL usage

4. If cloud infrastructure code is detected (Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK,
   Bicep, ARM templates, Pulumi, serverless configs), apply cloud-specific
   expertise:
   - **GCP**: IAM bindings vs policies, service account key management, VPC
     Service Controls, Cloud Armor, audit logging, org policy constraints,
     workload identity
   - **AWS**: IAM least-privilege, S3 bucket policies, security group rules,
     Lambda concurrency/timeout, VPC design, encryption at rest/in transit,
     CloudTrail logging, resource tagging
   - **Azure**: RBAC role assignments, managed identity usage, NSG rules, Key
     Vault references, diagnostic settings, policy assignments, private
     endpoints

5. Read any CLAUDE.md files in the project root and affected directories for
   project-specific conventions.

---

## Phase 1: Code Review (Bugs, Logic, Conventions)

Launch parallel sub-agents for independent review perspectives:

### Agent 1 — CLAUDE.md Compliance

Audit changes against all applicable CLAUDE.md rules. Verify imports, naming,
framework conventions, error handling, logging, testing practices, and platform
compatibility.

### Agent 2 — Bug Detection (Shallow Scan)

Read file changes and scan for obvious bugs. Focus on:

- Logic errors and incorrect behavior
- Edge cases not handled
- Null/undefined/nil reference issues
- Race conditions or concurrency bugs
- API contract violations
- Incorrect caching (staleness, key bugs, invalid invalidation)
- Resource leaks (file handles, connections, memory)
- Off-by-one errors, integer overflow, unsigned arithmetic issues

### Agent 3 — Historical Context

Read git blame and history of modified code. Identify bugs in light of
historical context, reverted patterns, and known fragile areas.

### Agent 4 — Cross-Reference Prior PRs

Read previous PRs that touched these files. Check for recurring review comments
that apply to the current changes.

### Agent 5 — Code Comment Compliance

Read inline comments in modified files. Verify changes comply with guidance in
comments (TODOs, invariant notes, safety comments).

**Confidence Scoring** (apply to every finding):

- 0-25: Likely false positive or pre-existing — discard
- 26-50: Minor nitpick not in CLAUDE.md — discard
- 51-75: Valid but low-impact — report only if all scope
- 76-90: Important, requires attention — always report
- 91-100: Critical bug or explicit CLAUDE.md violation — always report

**Filter threshold: >= 80 confidence only.**

**False Positive Exclusions:**

- Pre-existing issues not introduced by the current changes
- Issues a linter, typechecker, or compiler would catch
- Pedantic nitpicks a senior engineer would not flag
- General quality issues (coverage, docs) unless required by CLAUDE.md
- CLAUDE.md rules explicitly silenced via lint-ignore comments
- Intentional functionality changes related to the broader change
- Issues on lines the author did not modify

---

## Phase 2: Security Audit

> Only flag issues with >80% confidence of actual exploitability. Better to miss
> theoretical issues than flood with false positives.

### Categories to Examine

**Input Validation:**

- SQL injection, command injection, XXE, template injection, NoSQL injection,
  path traversal

**Authentication & Authorization:**

- Auth bypass, privilege escalation, session management flaws, JWT
  vulnerabilities, authz logic bypasses

**Crypto & Secrets:**

- Hardcoded keys/tokens/passwords, weak algorithms, improper key storage,
  randomness issues, cert validation bypasses

**Injection & Code Execution:**

- RCE via unsafe deserialization, eval/exec injection, XSS (reflected, stored,
  DOM-based)

**Data Exposure:**

- Sensitive data logging, PII handling violations, API data leakage, debug info
  exposure

### Language-Specific Security Checks

- **C/C++**: Buffer overflows, use-after-free, double-free, format string
  vulnerabilities, integer overflow leading to memory corruption
- **Rust**: Unsafe block audit, FFI boundary safety, transmute misuse — memory
  safety issues outside unsafe are not reportable
- **Python**: Unsafe deserialization, eval/exec, subprocess with shell=True,
  YAML unsafe load
- **Swift**: Force unwraps in untrusted data paths, UnsafePointer misuse
- **TypeScript**: Unsafe innerHTML assignment, security trust bypass methods,
  prototype pollution (high-confidence only)
- **Java**: Unsafe deserialization (ObjectInputStream), JNDI injection, SpEL
  injection, XXE via DocumentBuilder, SQL injection via string concatenation
- **Ruby**: Dynamic dispatch (send/public_send) with user input, ERB injection,
  unsafe Marshal.load
- **Dart**: Platform channel injection, insecure storage on mobile

### Cloud Infrastructure Security Checks

- **GCP**: Overly permissive IAM bindings (allUsers/allAuthenticatedUsers),
  public Cloud Storage buckets, service account keys in code (use workload
  identity), missing audit logging, firewall rules open to `0.0.0.0/0`, Cloud
  Functions with unauthenticated invocation on sensitive endpoints, missing VPC
  Service Controls for sensitive projects, default service account usage with
  editor role
- **AWS**: Overly permissive IAM policies (`*` actions/resources), public S3
  buckets, unencrypted storage (EBS, RDS, S3), security groups open to
  `0.0.0.0/0` on sensitive ports, missing CloudTrail/logging, hardcoded
  credentials in CloudFormation/CDK, Lambda environment variables with secrets
  (use Secrets Manager/SSM), cross-account access without external ID, missing
  VPC endpoints for AWS services
- **Azure**: Overly permissive RBAC assignments (Owner/Contributor at
  subscription scope), storage accounts with public blob access, missing Key
  Vault for secrets (hardcoded in ARM/Bicep), NSG rules open to `Any` on
  sensitive ports, missing diagnostic settings, managed identity not used where
  available, missing private endpoints for PaaS services, Azure AD app
  registrations with excessive API permissions

### Hard Exclusions (Do NOT Report)

1. Denial of Service / resource exhaustion
2. Secrets stored on disk if otherwise secured
3. Rate limiting concerns
4. Lack of hardening measures (only flag concrete vulnerabilities)
5. Race conditions unless concretely exploitable
6. Outdated third-party library versions
7. Memory safety in memory-safe languages outside unsafe blocks
8. Test-only files
9. Log spoofing
10.   SSRF controlling only the path (not host/protocol)
11.   User content in AI prompts
12.   Regex injection/ReDoS
13.   Documentation files
14.   Environment variables and CLI flags (treated as trusted)
15.   Client-side permission checks (server is responsible)

### Severity Ratings

- **HIGH**: Directly exploitable — RCE, data breach, auth bypass (confidence >=
  0.8)
- **MEDIUM**: Requires specific conditions but significant impact (confidence >=
  0.8, must be obvious and concrete)
- **LOW**: Defense-in-depth — do not report

---

## Phase 3: Code Simplification

Analyze recently modified code and apply refinements that:

1. **Preserve Functionality**: Never change what the code does — only how it
   does it
2. **Apply Project Standards**: Follow CLAUDE.md conventions for the language in
   use
3. **Enhance Clarity**:

- Reduce unnecessary complexity and nesting
- Eliminate redundant code and abstractions
- Improve variable and function names
- Consolidate related logic
- Remove comments that describe obvious code
- Avoid nested ternary operators — prefer switch/match/if-else for multiple
  conditions
- Choose clarity over brevity — explicit is better than overly compact

4. **Maintain Balance** — Avoid over-simplification that:

- Creates overly clever solutions hard to understand
- Combines too many concerns into single functions
- Removes helpful abstractions
- Prioritizes fewer lines over readability
- Makes code harder to debug or extend

### Language-Specific Simplification

- **Python**: Replace verbose patterns with comprehensions, prefer `pathlib`
  over `os.path`, use match statements ( 3.10+)
- **Swift**: Leverage trailing closure syntax, prefer guard-let over nested
  if-let, use result builders where appropriate
- **TypeScript**: Use discriminated unions over type assertions, prefer
  satisfies for type validation, use as const for literal types
- **Rust**: Use ? operator over match chains, prefer iterator combinators over
  loops where clearer, leverage impl Trait in argument position
- **Java**: Use records for value objects (16+), prefer sealed
  classes/interfaces for restricted hierarchies (17+), leverage Optional over
  null returns, use try-with-resources for AutoCloseable
- **C**: Extract repeated patterns into well-named functions, ensure consistent
  error-code-based cleanup patterns
- **C++**: Use structured bindings, range-based for loops, std::optional over
  sentinel values, CTAD where it helps readability
- **Ruby**: Leverage then/yield_self, prefer frozen_string_literal, use pattern
  matching (3.0+)
- **Dart**: Use cascade notation, prefer `final` over `var`, leverage
  collection-if/collection-for

### Cloud Infrastructure Simplification

- **GCP Terraform**: Use `for_each` over `count` for named resources,
  consolidate repeated IAM bindings into `google_project_iam_policy` or member
  blocks, prefer workload identity over service account keys, use modules for
  repeated patterns
- **AWS CloudFormation/CDK**: Replace inline policies with managed policies
  where appropriate, use `!Sub` over `!Join`/`Fn::Join` for string
  interpolation, consolidate duplicate IAM statements, prefer CDK L2/L3
  constructs over L1 (Cfn\*) when available
- **Azure Bicep/ARM**: Prefer Bicep over raw ARM templates, use modules for
  repeated resource patterns, consolidate role assignments, use `existing`
  keyword instead of `reference()`, prefer user-assigned managed identity over
  system-assigned when shared across resources
- **General IaC**: Remove redundant default values that match provider defaults,
  extract repeated values into variables/ parameters, ensure consistent
  tagging/labeling strategy, prefer declarative over imperative patterns

---

## Phase 4: Error Handling Audit (Silent Failure Hunting)

Systematically locate and scrutinize:

### Identify All Error Handling Code

- try-catch / try-except / Result types / error callbacks
- Conditional branches handling error states
- Fallback logic and default values on failure
- Optional chaining or null coalescing hiding errors

### For Each Error Handler, Evaluate

**Logging Quality:**

- Is the error logged with appropriate severity?
- Does the log include sufficient context (operation, IDs, state)?
- Would this log help debug the issue 6 months from now?

**User Feedback:**

- Does the user receive clear, actionable feedback?
- Is the error message specific enough to be useful?

**Catch Block Specificity:**

- Does it catch only expected error types?
- Could it accidentally suppress unrelated errors?
- List every unexpected error type that could be hidden

**Fallback Behavior:**

- Is the fallback explicitly justified?
- Does it mask the underlying problem?
- Is it a fallback to a mock/stub outside test code?

**Error Propagation:**

- Should this error bubble up instead of being caught here?
- Does catching prevent proper cleanup/resource management?

### Severity Ratings

- **CRITICAL**: Silent failure, broad catch, empty catch block
- **HIGH**: Poor error message, unjustified fallback, swallowed error
- **MEDIUM**: Missing context, could be more specific

---

## Phase 5: Type Design Analysis

For every new or modified type definition:

### Analysis Framework

1. **Identify Invariants**: Data consistency, valid state transitions,
   relationship constraints, business rules, pre/postconditions
2. **Evaluate Encapsulation** (1-10): Hidden internals? Invariants violable from
   outside? Minimal interface?
3. **Assess Invariant Expression** (1-10): Clear communication through
   structure? Compile-time enforcement? Self-documenting?
4. **Judge Usefulness** (1-10): Prevents real bugs? Aligned with requirements?
   Aids reasoning?
5. **Examine Enforcement** (1-10): Checked at construction? Mutation points
   guarded? Impossible to create invalid instances?

### Anti-Patterns to Flag

- Anemic domain models with no behavior
- Types exposing mutable internals
- Invariants enforced only through documentation
- Types with too many responsibilities
- Missing validation at construction boundaries
- Types relying on external code to maintain invariants

### Language-Specific Type Concerns

- **TypeScript**: Discriminated unions over type assertions, branded types for
  domain IDs
- **Python**: Frozen dataclasses for immutable value objects, **post_init**
  validation
- **Rust**: Newtype pattern for domain primitives, non_exhaustive for
  future-proof enums
- **Swift**: Structs with let properties for value types, protocol witnesses
- **Dart**: Freezed for immutable data, sealed classes for union types
- **Java**: Records for immutable value types, sealed interfaces for sum types,
  private constructors with static factory methods for validated types
- **C++**: Strong typedefs, RAII wrappers, deleted copy/move where appropriate
- **C**: Opaque pointers for encapsulation, static assertions for struct
  invariants
- **Ruby**: Struct or Data (Ruby 3.2+) for value objects, freeze patterns

### Cloud Resource Configuration Concerns

- **GCP Terraform**: Missing `prevent_destroy` lifecycle on stateful resources,
  overly broad OAuth scopes, missing labels for cost attribution, default
  network usage
- **AWS CDK/CloudFormation**: Stack outputs exposing sensitive values, missing
  `RemovalPolicy.RETAIN` on stateful resources, Lambda permissions broader than
  needed, missing resource-based policies
- **Azure Bicep**: Missing `lock` on critical resources, overly permissive CORS
  settings, missing `minTlsVersion`, storage accounts without lifecycle
  management policies

---

## Phase 6: Architecture Analysis (On Request)

When architect scope is requested:

1. **Codebase Pattern Analysis**: Extract existing patterns, conventions, module
   boundaries, abstraction layers
2. **Architecture Design**: Make decisive choices based on patterns found.
   Design for testability, performance, maintainability
3. **Implementation Blueprint**:

- Patterns and conventions found with file:line references
- Component design with file paths, responsibilities, dependencies, interfaces
- Data flow from entry points through transformations to outputs
- Phased implementation steps as a checklist
- Error handling, state management, testing, performance, security
  considerations

---

## Phase 7: Custom Focus (On Request)

When `custom` scope is requested:

1. **Parse the user-supplied criteria** from the remaining arguments — treat
   them as a natural-language review directive (e.g. "check for N+1 queries",
   "audit thread safety", "verify no blocking I/O in async paths").
2. **Scope the review** to the files or paths implied by the directive or by
   `$ARGUMENTS`; fall back to the diff if no target is specified.
3. **Apply the same rigor as the built-in phases**: gather context, launch
   parallel sub-agents if the criteria decompose into independent checks, apply
   the >= 80 confidence filter, and exclude false positives per Phase 1 rules.
4. **Report findings** using the Code Review output format below, with the
   `[Category]` field set to a short label derived from the custom directive
   (e.g. `N+1`, `ThreadSafety`, `BlockingIO`).

Use this scope when the built-in phases do not cover the specific concern the
user wants investigated.

---

## Execution Strategy

1. **Gather context** — git status, diff, log, CLAUDE.md files (Phase 0)
2. **Launch parallel review agents** for independent analysis perspectives
   (Phase 1)
3. **Run security audit** on the diff (Phase 2)
4. **Filter all findings** through confidence scoring — discard below 80
5. **Apply simplification analysis** to surviving code (Phase 3)
6. **Audit error handling** in changed code (Phase 4)
7. **Analyze new/modified types** (Phase 5)
8. **Architecture analysis** if requested (Phase 6)
9. **Custom focus analysis** if requested (Phase 7)
10.   **Aggregate and present** results in the output format above, organized by
      severity
11.   **Generate summary table** — produce a consolidated findings table as the
      final output

Launch phases 1-5 as parallel sub-agents where possible; Phase 7 may itself
dispatch parallel sub-agents when the custom directive decomposes into
independent checks. Each sub-agent should include the full context of its phase
instructions above.

**Final reminder:** Focus on HIGH and MEDIUM findings only. Every finding should
be something a senior engineer would confidently raise. Cite specific file:line
references. Provide concrete fixes, not vague suggestions.
