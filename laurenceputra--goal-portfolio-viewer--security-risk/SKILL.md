# Security Risk

Identify security and privacy risks and propose mitigations.

## Workflow
1. Review data flows and trust boundaries.
2. Scan for injection, logging, auth, and cross-origin risks.
3. Validate privacy boundaries (what is and is not synced/stored/transmitted).
4. Summarize risks and mitigations.

## Cross-Origin Security Checks
For backend APIs called from browsers:
- Treat CORS as an explicit allowlist decision per origin.
- Verify `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is echoed from a vetted allowlist (no wildcard for credentialed/sensitive flows).
- Ensure disallowed origins receive no allow-origin header.
- Add `Vary: Origin` when origin-based responses differ.
- Confirm preflight and non-preflight responses enforce consistent origin policy.
- Confirm config docs and runtime env origins are aligned to avoid accidental exposure or outages.

## Sync Privacy Checks
For encrypted sync payload systems:
- Verify server treats encrypted payload as opaque unless schema parsing is explicitly required.
- Confirm migrations do not broaden synced data classes (e.g., no amounts/PII unless approved).
- Confirm logs/telemetry do not include sensitive payload content.

## Output Format
- Risks identified
- Mitigations
- Residual risk
