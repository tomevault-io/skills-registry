# Style Consistency Enforcer (Stil-Wachter)

Analyze multiple assets and define a unified visual style guide.

## When to Use

- Multiple images that don't match
- Assets from different sources/generators
- Need to regenerate consistent variants
- Something feels "off" but can't pinpoint it

## Process

### 1. Catalog Each Asset

For each image, document:

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Style | flat/detailed/painterly/3D |
| Line weight | thin/medium/thick/none |
| Color saturation | muted/moderate/vibrant |
| Color temperature | warm/neutral/cool |
| Shading | flat/soft gradient/hard shadows |
| Texture | smooth/grainy/noisy |
| Perspective | flat/isometric/realistic |
| Detail level | minimal/moderate/high |

### 2. Identify Conflicts

| Attribute | Asset A | Asset B | Conflict? |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Style | flat minimal | detailed realistic | YES |
| Colors | muted teal | vibrant cyan | mild |
| Line weight | none | thick outlines | YES |

### 3. Choose Target Style

Pick the asset that:
- Best represents desired vibe
- Would be hardest to regenerate
- Has most screen presence

Document as the "style anchor."

### 4. Create Style Guide

```markdown
## Unified Style Guide

**Base Style:** [e.g., Flat minimalist illustration]
**Color Palette:** [e.g., Muted teals and navy]
**Line Weight:** [e.g., None (shapes only)]
**Shading:** [e.g., Soft gradients, no hard shadows]
**Texture:** [e.g., Smooth, no grain]
**Perspective:** [e.g., Slight depth, not fully flat]

### Do's
- [specific guidelines]

### Don'ts
- [things to avoid]
```

### 5. Asset-Specific Fixes

For each non-conforming asset:

```
Asset: [name]
Current: [current style]
Target: [target style]

Fixes needed:
- [specific change 1]
- [specific change 2]

Regeneration prompt:
"[subject], [style], [colors], [atmosphere]"
```

### 6. Unified Prompt Template

```
[SUBJECT DESCRIPTION]

Style: [e.g., flat minimalist vector illustration]
Colors: [specific hex codes]
Atmosphere: [mood descriptors]
Shading: [approach]
Details: [level]
Background: [treatment]

Negative: [things to exclude]
```

## Quick Comparison Checklist

- [ ] Same illustration style?
- [ ] Matching color temperature?
- [ ] Similar saturation levels?
- [ ] Consistent line treatment?
- [ ] Compatible perspectives?
- [ ] Unified shading approach?
- [ ] Matching detail density?

## Common Style Families

| Style | Characteristics | Good For |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Flat Minimal | No shadows, bold shapes, limited colors | Modern apps |
| Soft Gradient | Gentle shading, atmospheric | Premium feel |
| Line Art | Outlines, minimal fill | Technical, playful |
| Isometric | 30° angles, consistent depth | Data viz, gaming |
