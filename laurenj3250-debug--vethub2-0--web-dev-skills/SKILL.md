## How to Use These Skills

When I detect you're working on a web development task, I'll automatically reference the relevant skill(s) from this collection.

### Manual Usage

You can also explicitly request a specific skill:

```
"Using the NextJS App Router skill, help me build a dashboard page"
"Reference the Tailwind Design System skill to style this component"
"Apply the Vitest Unit Testing skill to write tests for this function"
```

### Loading Multiple Skills

For complex tasks, I can reference multiple skills:

```
"Using the NextJS, Prisma, and NextAuth skills, help me build a user profile page"
```

## Skill Loading Strategy

I will:
1. **Detect** what technology/task you're working on
2. **Identify** which skill(s) are relevant
3. **Read** the specific skill file(s) from `~/claude-prompt-engineering-guide/skills/examples/`
4. **Apply** the patterns and best practices from those skills
5. **Load on-demand** - Only read skills when needed to avoid context bloat

## Quick Reference by Task Type

**Building a new feature:**
→ NextJS + Tailwind + Prisma + Testing

**Adding authentication:**
→ NextAuth + Security + TypeScript

**Deploying an app:**
→ Vercel + Monitoring + Performance

**Writing tests:**
→ Vitest + Playwright + Testing

**API development:**
→ API Development + Prisma + TypeScript

**Styling components:**
→ Tailwind + Accessibility + TypeScript

**Infrastructure setup:**
→ AWS/GCP + Monitoring + Security

**Code quality:**
→ Code Review + TypeScript + Testing

## Best Practices

1. **Start with architecture** - Consider NextJS patterns first
2. **Type safety** - Apply TypeScript standards throughout
3. **Test as you build** - Reference testing skills early
4. **Accessibility first** - Check accessibility guidelines
5. **Security by default** - Apply security best practices
6. **Performance matters** - Optimize as you develop
7. **Review before deploy** - Use code review checklist

## Pro Tips

- These skills work **together** - combine them for complex tasks
- Skills contain **real code examples** - patterns you can copy
- Skills enforce **best practices** - follow their guidelines
- Skills are **framework-specific** - optimized for modern stack
