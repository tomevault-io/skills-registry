# /blueprint:derive-rules

Extract project decisions from git commit history and codify them as Claude rules. Newer commits override older decisions when conflicts exist.

**Use case**: Derive implicit project patterns from git history to establish consistent AI-assisted development guidelines.

**Usage**: `/blueprint:derive-rules [--since DATE] [--scope SCOPE]`

## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use alternative when... |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Want to extract implicit decisions from git history | Creating rules from requirements (use PRDs instead) |
| Project has significant commit history | New project with little history |
| Establishing project coding standards | Quick manual rule creation |

## Context

- Git repository: !`git rev-parse --git-dir`
- Blueprint initialized: !`find docs/blueprint -maxdepth 1 -name 'manifest.json' -type f`
- Total commits: !`git rev-list --count HEAD`
- Conventional commits %: !`git log --format="%s"`
- Existing rules: !`find .claude/rules -name "*.md" -type f`

## Parameters

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

- `--since DATE`: Analyze commits from specific date (e.g., `--since 2024-01-01`)
- `--scope SCOPE`: Focus on specific area (e.g., `--scope api`, `--scope testing`)

## Execution

Execute the complete git-to-rules derivation workflow:

### Step 1: Verify prerequisites

1. If not a git repository → Error: "This directory is not a git repository"
2. If Blueprint not initialized → Suggest `/blueprint:init` first
3. If few commits (< 20) → Warn: "Limited commit history; derived rules may be incomplete"

### Step 2: Analyze git history quality

1. Calculate total commits in scope
2. Calculate conventional commits percentage
3. Report quality: Higher % = higher confidence in extracted rules
4. Parse `--since` and `--scope` flags to determine analysis range

### Step 3: Extract decision-bearing commits

Use parallel agents to analyze git history efficiently (see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#git-analysis)):

- **Agent 1**: Analyze `refactor:` commits for code style patterns
- **Agent 2**: Analyze `fix:` commits for repeated issue types
- **Agent 3**: Analyze `feat!:` and `BREAKING CHANGE:` commits for architecture decisions
- **Agent 4**: Analyze `chore:` and `build:` commits for tooling decisions

Consolidate findings by domain (code-style, testing, api-design, etc.), chronologically (newest first), and by frequency (most common wins).

### Step 4: Resolve conflicts

When multiple commits address the same topic:

1. Detect conflicts using pattern matching: `git log --format="%H|%ai|%s" | grep "{topic}"`
2. Apply resolution strategy:
   - **Newer overrides older**: Latest decision wins
   - **Higher frequency wins**: If 5 commits say X and 1 says Y, X wins
   - **Breaking changes override**: `feat!:` trumps regular commits
3. Mark overridden decisions as "superseded" with reference to newer decision
4. Confirm significant decisions with user via AskUserQuestion

### Step 5: Generate rules in `.claude/rules/`

For each decision, generate rule file using template from [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#rule-template):

1. Extract source commit, date, type
2. Determine confidence level (High/Medium/Low based on commit frequency and clarity)
3. Generate actionable rule statement
4. Include code examples from commit diffs
5. Reference any superseded earlier decisions
6. Add `paths` frontmatter when the rule is naturally scoped to specific file types (see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#rule-categories) for suggested patterns per category)

Generate separate rule files by category (see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#rule-categories)):
- `code-style.md`, `testing-standards.md`, `api-conventions.md`, `error-handling.md`, `dependencies.md`, `security-practices.md`

Path-scope rules where appropriate — e.g., `testing-standards.md` scoped to test files reduces context noise when working on non-test code.

### Step 6: Handle conflicts with existing rules

Check for conflicts with existing rules in `.claude/rules/`:

1. If conflicts found → Ask user: Git-derived overrides existing rule, or keep existing?
2. Apply user choice: Update, merge, or keep separate
3. Document conflict resolution in rule file

### Step 7: Update task registry

Update the task registry entry in `docs/blueprint/manifest.json`:

```bash
jq --arg now "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  --arg sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null)" \
  --argjson processed "${COMMITS_ANALYZED:-0}" \
  --argjson created "${RULES_DERIVED:-0}" \
  '.task_registry["derive-rules"].last_completed_at = $now |
   .task_registry["derive-rules"].last_result = "success" |
   .task_registry["derive-rules"].context.commits_analyzed_up_to = $sha |
   .task_registry["derive-rules"].stats.runs_total = ((.task_registry["derive-rules"].stats.runs_total // 0) + 1) |
   .task_registry["derive-rules"].stats.items_processed = $processed |
   .task_registry["derive-rules"].stats.items_created = $created' \
  docs/blueprint/manifest.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json docs/blueprint/manifest.json
```

### Step 8: Update manifest and report

1. Update `docs/blueprint/manifest.json` with derived rules metadata: timestamp, commits analyzed, rules generated, source commits
2. Generate completion report showing:
   - Commits analyzed (count and date range)
   - Conventional commits percentage
   - Rules generated by category
   - Confidence scores per rule
   - Any conflicts resolved
3. Prompt user for next action: Review rules, execute derived development workflow, or done

## Agentic Optimizations

| Context | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Check git status | `git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null && echo "YES" \|\| echo "NO"` |
| Count total commits | `git rev-list --count HEAD 2>/dev/null \|\| echo "0"` |
| Conventional commits % | `git log --format="%s" \| grep -c "^(feat\|fix\|refactor)" \|\| echo 0` |
| Extract decision commits | `git log --format="%H\|%s\|%b" \| grep -E "(always\|never\|must\|prefer)"` |
| Fast derivation | Use parallel agents (Explore) for multi-domain analysis |
