|------------------------|----------------------|
| Creating a new PR | Just crafting a title (`github-pr-title`) |

### Section Guidelines

| Section | Purpose | Required |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Summary | What the PR does (1-2 sentences) | Yes |
| Motivation | Why this change is needed | Yes |
| Changes | Key changes as bullet points | Yes |
| Pre-merge Checklist | Actions before merge only — never post-merge steps | If applicable |
| Follow-up Issues | Links to issues tracking post-merge actions | If post-merge work exists |
| Related Issues | Issue links at bottom | Yes |

### Issue Linking Syntax

Place at the **bottom** of the PR description:

```markdown
## Related Issues
Fixes #123              <!-- Auto-closes on merge -->
Closes #456             <!-- Auto-closes on merge -->
Resolves #789           <!-- Auto-closes on merge -->
Related: #124, #125     <!-- Links without closing -->
```

**Rules:**
- Use `Fixes`, `Closes`, or `Resolves` for issues this PR solves
- Use `Related:` for issues that are related but not solved
- Follow-up work should be created as new issues, not left in checklist

## Workflow

> **Before creating the PR**, check whether any post-merge follow-up actions are needed (migrations, deployments, config changes, runbook updates). Create a GitHub issue for each and link them in the PR description. See [Post-Merge Follow-up Issues](#post-merge-follow-up-issues).

### 1. Assess PR Readiness

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Fetch latest remote state for accurate comparison
git fetch origin main

# Check commits ahead of origin/main (always compare against remote)
ahead=$(git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
if [ "$ahead" = "0" ]; then
  echo "No commits ahead of origin/main - nothing to create PR for"
  exit 1
fi

# Check for existing PR
gh pr view --json number,state 2>/dev/null || echo "no existing PR"
```

### 2. Analyze Commits

**CRITICAL:** Always compare against `origin/main` (not local `main`) to avoid including commits that haven't been merged to the remote. Local `main` may be ahead of `origin/main` with unrelated commits.

```bash
# Fetch latest remote state
git fetch origin main

# Always use origin/main as base reference
base_ref="origin/main"

git log $base_ref..HEAD --format='%H %s'

# Extract issue references
git log $base_ref..HEAD --format='%B' | grep -oE '#[0-9]+' | sort -u

# Get diff stats
git diff $base_ref...HEAD --stat
```

### 3. Identify Post-Merge Follow-ups and Create Issues

Before creating the PR, scan for any actions required **after** the PR is merged (deployments, migrations, config changes, external docs). For each:

```bash
# Create a follow-up issue
gh issue create \
  --title "[Chore] DB: Run migration for new schema" \
  --body "Follow-up to PR that adds user_preferences.\n\nRun: rake db:migrate in production after deploy."
# Returns: https://github.com/org/repo/issues/456
```

Keep a list of created issue numbers to link in the PR body.

### 4. Create PR

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat(scope): add feature" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

EOF
)"
```

## PR Title Format

Use conventional commits format (see `github-pr-title` skill):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Examples:
- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 support`
- `fix(api): handle null response`
- `docs(readme): update installation`

## PR Options

| Option | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Draft | `gh pr create --draft` |
| Labels | `gh pr create --label "enhancement"` |
| Reviewers | `gh pr create --reviewer user1,user2` |
| Base branch | `gh pr create --base develop` |
| Assignee | `gh pr create --assignee @me` |

## Main-Branch Development

When on main, push to remote feature branch:

```bash
# Push main to remote feature branch
git push origin main:feat/feature-name

# Create PR with --head
gh pr create --head feat/feature-name --base main --title "..." --body "..."
```

## Pre-merge Checklist Guidelines

Include only actions **before** merging:
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

**Do NOT include post-merge steps in the checklist.** PR descriptions are closed and buried after merge — checklists embedded there are easily missed. Post-merge actions must be tracked as GitHub issues.

## Post-Merge Follow-up Issues

When a PR requires actions **after** it is merged, create a separate GitHub issue for each follow-up. Link all follow-up issues in the PR description under a **Follow-up Issues** section.

**Why issues, not PR checklists:** Once a PR is merged and closed, its description is rarely revisited. A GitHub issue stays open and assignable until explicitly closed, ensuring the follow-up is not lost.

### Common post-merge follow-up types

| Type | Example follow-up issue title |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Database migration | `[Chore] DB: Run schema migration for user_preferences table` |
| Deployment | `[Chore] Ops: Deploy feature-flag config to production` |
| Manual configuration | `[Chore] Config: Enable new OAuth provider in admin panel` |
| External documentation | `[Docs] Wiki: Update runbook for new deploy process` |
| Communication | `[Chore] Comms: Announce deprecation of /v1 API to customers` |
| Dependent PR | `[Feature] Next: Implement follow-on X after Y lands` |

### Workflow

1. **Identify** post-merge actions from commit messages, PR body, or conversation context.
2. **Create an issue** for each follow-up:
   ```bash
   gh issue create \
     --title "[Chore] DB: Run migration for new schema" \
     --body "After #42 merges, run: \`rake db:migrate\` in production.\n\nSee PR #42 for context." \
     --label "chore"
   ```
3. **Link** the newly created issues in the PR description:
   ```bash
   gh pr edit <pr-number> --body "$(gh pr view <pr-number> --json body -q '.body')

   ## Follow-up Issues
   - #<issue-num>: run database migration
   - #<issue-num>: update deployment runbook"
   ```
4. **Do NOT** add post-merge steps to the Pre-merge Checklist.

### Example: PR description with follow-up issues

```markdown
## Follow-up Issues
<!-- These issues track post-merge work and will stay open until completed -->
- #456: run database migration for user_preferences table
- #457: update production feature-flag config
```

## Output

On success, report:
```
Created PR #42: feat(auth): add OAuth2 support
URL: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42

Related Issues:
  Fixes #123
  Related: #456

Status: Open
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Branch not pushed | Push first or use main-branch pattern |
| PR exists | `gh pr view` or `gh pr edit` |
