# Mutation Testing

Expert knowledge for mutation testing - validating that your tests actually catch bugs by introducing deliberate code mutations.

## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use another skill instead when... |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Validating test effectiveness | Writing unit tests (use vitest-testing) |
| Finding weak/insufficient tests | Analyzing test smells (use test-quality-analysis) |
| Setting up Stryker or mutmut | Writing E2E tests (use playwright-testing) |
| Improving mutation score | Generating test data (use property-based-testing) |
| Checking if tests catch real bugs | Setting up code coverage only |

## Core Expertise

**Mutation Testing Concept**
- **Mutants**: Small code changes (mutations) introduced automatically
- **Killed**: Test fails with mutation (good - test caught the bug)
- **Survived**: Test passes with mutation (bad - weak test)
- **Coverage**: Tests execute mutated code but don't catch it
- **Score**: Percentage of mutants killed (aim for 80%+)

**What Mutation Testing Reveals**
- Tests that don't actually verify behavior
- Missing assertions or edge cases
- Overly permissive assertions
- Dead code or unnecessary logic
- Areas needing stronger tests

## TypeScript/JavaScript (Stryker)

### Installation

```bash
# Using Bun
bun add -d @stryker-mutator/core

# For Vitest
bun add -d @stryker-mutator/vitest-runner

# For Jest
bun add -d @stryker-mutator/jest-runner
```

### Running Stryker

```bash
npx stryker run                                    # Run mutation testing
npx stryker run --incremental                      # Only changed files
npx stryker run --mutate "src/utils/**/*.ts"       # Specific files
npx stryker run --reporters html,clear-text        # HTML report
open reports/mutation/html/index.html              # View report
```

### Understanding Results

```
Mutation score: 82.5%
- Killed: 66 (tests caught the mutation)
- Survived: 14 (tests passed despite mutation - weak tests!)
- No Coverage: 0 (mutated code not executed)
- Timeout: 0 (tests took too long)
```

### Example: Weak vs Strong Test

```typescript
// Source code
function calculateDiscount(price: number, percentage: number): number {
  return price - (price * percentage / 100)
}

// WEAK: Test passes even if we mutate the calculation
test('applies discount', () => {
  const result = calculateDiscount(100, 10)
  expect(result).toBeDefined() // Too weak!
})

// STRONG: Test catches mutation
test('applies discount correctly', () => {
  expect(calculateDiscount(100, 10)).toBe(90)
  expect(calculateDiscount(100, 20)).toBe(80)
  expect(calculateDiscount(50, 10)).toBe(45)
})
```

## Python (mutmut)

### Installation

```bash
uv add --dev mutmut                    # Using uv
pip install mutmut                     # Using pip
```

### Running mutmut

```bash
uv run mutmut run                                          # Run mutation testing
uv run mutmut run --paths-to-mutate=src/calculator.py      # Specific files
uv run mutmut results                                      # Show results
uv run mutmut summary                                      # Summary
uv run mutmut show 1                                       # Show specific mutant
uv run mutmut apply 1                                      # Apply mutant manually
uv run mutmut html                                         # HTML report
```

### Understanding Results

```
Status: 45/50 mutants killed (90%)
- Killed: 45 (tests caught the mutation)
- Survived: 5 (tests passed despite mutation)
```

## Mutation Score Targets

| Score | Quality | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 90%+ | Excellent | Maintain quality |
| 80-89% | Good | Small improvements |
| 70-79% | Acceptable | Focus on weak areas |
| 60-69% | Needs work | Add missing tests |
| < 60% | Poor | Major test improvements needed |

## Agentic Optimizations

| Context | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Quick TS mutation | `npx stryker run --incremental --reporters clear-text` |
| Targeted TS mutation | `npx stryker run --mutate "src/core/**/*.ts"` |
| Quick Python mutation | `uv run mutmut run --paths-to-mutate=src/core/` |
| View survived | `uv run mutmut results \| grep Survived` |
| CI mode | `npx stryker run --reporters json` |
