# Check AI Output Before It Ships

Guide the user through adding verification and guardrails so bad AI outputs never reach users. The pattern: generate, check, fix or reject.

## Step 1: Understand what to check

Ask the user:
1. **What could go wrong?** (hallucinations, wrong format, offensive content, missing info, factual errors?)
2. **How strict does it need to be?** (reject bad outputs vs. try to fix them?)
3. **What's the cost of a bad output reaching users?** (annoyance vs. legal/safety risk)

## Step 2: Quick wins — DSPy assertions

The simplest way to add checks. `dspy.Assert` is a hard stop (retry if violated), `dspy.Suggest` is a soft nudge:

```python
import dspy

class CheckedResponder(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.respond = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateResponse)

    def forward(self, question):
        result = self.respond(question=question)

        # Hard checks — will retry if these fail
        dspy.Assert(
            len(result.answer) > 0,
            "Must produce an answer"
        )
        dspy.Assert(
            len(result.answer.split()) <= 200,
            "Answer must be under 200 words"
        )

        # Soft checks — hints for improvement
        dspy.Suggest(
            "I don't know" not in result.answer.lower(),
            "Try to provide a substantive answer"
        )
        dspy.Suggest(
            not any(word in result.answer.lower() for word in ["definitely", "absolutely", "100%"]),
            "Avoid overconfident language"
        )

        return result
```

DSPy will automatically retry the LM call (with the assertion feedback) when an `Assert` fails, up to a configurable number of times.

## Step 3: Format validation

### Type-based validation (automatic)

DSPy validates typed outputs automatically:

```python
from typing import Literal
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Response(BaseModel):
    answer: str = Field(min_length=1, max_length=500)
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    category: str

class MySignature(dspy.Signature):
    question: str = dspy.InputField()
    response: Response = dspy.OutputField()
```

Pydantic catches malformed JSON, out-of-range values, and wrong types before your code ever sees them.

### Custom validation in the module

```python
import re

class ValidatedExtractor(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.extract = dspy.ChainOfThought(ExtractContact)

    def forward(self, text):
        result = self.extract(text=text)

        # Validate email format
        dspy.Assert(
            re.match(r"[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+", result.email or ""),
            "Email must be a valid email address"
        )

        # Validate phone format
        dspy.Assert(
            len(re.sub(r"\D", "", result.phone or "")) >= 10,
            "Phone must have at least 10 digits"
        )

        return result
```

## Step 4: Factual verification

### Self-check — ask the AI to verify its own output

```python
class VerifyFacts(dspy.Signature):
    """Check if the answer is supported by the given context."""
    context: list[str] = dspy.InputField(desc="Source documents")
    answer: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Generated answer to verify")
    is_supported: bool = dspy.OutputField(desc="Is the answer fully supported by the context?")
    unsupported_claims: list[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="Claims not found in context")

class GroundedResponder(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=5)
        self.answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(AnswerFromDocs)
        self.verify = dspy.Predict(VerifyFacts)

    def forward(self, question):
        context = self.retrieve(question).passages
        response = self.answer(context=context, question=question)

        # Verify the answer is grounded in sources
        check = self.verify(context=context, answer=response.answer)
        dspy.Assert(
            check.is_supported,
            f"Answer contains unsupported claims: {check.unsupported_claims}. "
            "Rewrite using only information from the context."
        )

        return response
```

### Cross-check — generate two ways, compare

```python
class CrossCheckedAnswer(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.answer_a = dspy.ChainOfThought(AnswerQuestion)
        self.answer_b = dspy.ChainOfThought(AnswerQuestion)
        self.compare = dspy.ChainOfThought(CompareAnswers)

    def forward(self, question):
        a = self.answer_a(question=question)
        b = self.answer_b(question=question)

        comparison = self.compare(
            question=question,
            answer_a=a.answer,
            answer_b=b.answer,
        )

        dspy.Assert(
            comparison.agree,
            "Two independent generations disagree — the answer may be unreliable"
        )

        return a

class CompareAnswers(dspy.Signature):
    """Check if two independently generated answers agree."""
    question: str = dspy.InputField()
    answer_a: str = dspy.InputField()
    answer_b: str = dspy.InputField()
    agree: bool = dspy.OutputField(desc="Do the answers substantially agree?")
    discrepancy: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="What they disagree on, if anything")
```

## Step 5: Safety and content filtering

### Block harmful outputs

```python
BLOCKED_PATTERNS = [
    r"\b(password|secret|api.?key)\b",
    r"\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b",  # SSN pattern
]

class SafeResponder(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.respond = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateResponse)

    def forward(self, question):
        result = self.respond(question=question)

        # Check for leaked sensitive data
        for pattern in BLOCKED_PATTERNS:
            dspy.Assert(
                not re.search(pattern, result.answer, re.IGNORECASE),
                f"Response may contain sensitive data (pattern: {pattern})"
            )

        return result
```

### AI-as-safety-judge

```python
class SafetyCheck(dspy.Signature):
    """Check if the response is safe and appropriate."""
    question: str = dspy.InputField()
    response: str = dspy.InputField()
    is_safe: bool = dspy.OutputField()
    concern: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Safety concern if not safe, empty if safe")

class SafetyCheckedResponder(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.respond = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateResponse)
        self.check = dspy.Predict(SafetyCheck)

    def forward(self, question):
        result = self.respond(question=question)

        safety = self.check(question=question, response=result.answer)
        dspy.Assert(
            safety.is_safe,
            f"Response flagged as unsafe: {safety.concern}. Regenerate."
        )

        return result
```

## Step 6: Generate → Filter → Pick best (ensemble pattern)

For high-stakes outputs, generate multiple candidates and filter:

```python
class FilteredEnsemble(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_candidates=5):
        self.generators = [dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateAnswer) for _ in range(num_candidates)]
        self.judge = dspy.ChainOfThought(RankAnswers)

    def forward(self, question):
        candidates = []
        for gen in self.generators:
            try:
                result = gen(question=question)
                # Only keep candidates that pass basic checks
                if len(result.answer) > 0 and len(result.answer.split()) < 200:
                    candidates.append(result.answer)
            except Exception:
                continue

        dspy.Assert(len(candidates) > 0, "No valid candidates generated")

        return self.judge(question=question, candidates=candidates)

class RankAnswers(dspy.Signature):
    """Pick the best answer from the candidates."""
    question: str = dspy.InputField()
    candidates: list[str] = dspy.InputField()
    best_answer: str = dspy.OutputField()
```

## How backtracking works

When `dspy.Assert` fails, DSPy doesn't just retry blindly:

1. The assertion failure is caught
2. The error message is fed back to the LM as additional context
3. The LM retries with this feedback (e.g., "your answer was 350 words, must be under 280")
4. This repeats up to `max_backtrack_attempts` times (default: 2)
5. If all retries fail, the assertion raises an error

This is why **specific error messages matter** — they're the model's self-correction instructions. "Response is 350 words, must be under 280" is much more useful than "too long."

When combined with optimization (`/ai-improving-accuracy`), the model learns to satisfy constraints on the first try, reducing retries in production.

## Key patterns

- **Assert for hard requirements** — format, length, safety. DSPy retries automatically.
- **Suggest for soft preferences** — style, tone, detail level. Won't block but nudges.
- **Pydantic for structure** — catches malformed output automatically.
- **Self-verification for facts** — ask the AI "is this grounded in the sources?"
- **Cross-checking for reliability** — generate twice independently, compare.
- **Regex for sensitive data** — block SSNs, API keys, passwords in output.
- **Ensemble for high stakes** — generate many, filter, pick the best.

## Checklist: what to check

| Check | When to use | How |
|-------|------------|-----|
| Non-empty output | Always | `dspy.Assert(len(answer) > 0, ...)` |
| Length limits | User-facing text | `dspy.Assert(len(answer.split()) < N, ...)` |
| Valid format | Structured output | Pydantic model + `dspy.Assert` |
| Grounded in sources | RAG / doc search | Verification signature |
| No sensitive data | Any user-facing output | Regex patterns |
| Safe content | Public-facing apps | AI safety judge |
| Consistent | Critical decisions | Cross-check with two generations |
| High quality | High-stakes outputs | Ensemble + ranking |
