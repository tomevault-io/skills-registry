# Decompose a Failing AI Task

Guide the user through splitting a single unreliable AI step into multiple reliable subtasks. The insight: when a single prompt fails on complex inputs, restructuring the task — not just tweaking the prompt — is often the fix.

## Step 1: Diagnose why single-step fails

Ask the user:
1. **What's the task?** (extraction, classification, generation, etc.)
2. **When does it work?** (simple inputs, short text, single items)
3. **When does it fail?** (long documents, many items, mixed formats)

### Common failure modes

Look at the errors. They usually fall into one of these patterns:

| Failure mode | What you see | Root cause |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Missed items | Extracts 3 of 7 line items | Input overwhelms the context — too much to track at once |
| Conflated fields | Mixes up sender/recipient addresses | Multiple similar things extracted simultaneously |
| Inconsistent results | Works on invoice A, fails on invoice B | Different input formats need different handling |
| Degraded accuracy | 95% on short text, 60% on long text | Input length exceeds what a single pass can reliably process |

If the task works on simple inputs but fails on complex ones, decomposition is the right lever. If it fails on *everything*, try `/ai-improving-accuracy` first.

## Step 2: Choose a decomposition strategy

Match the failure mode to a pattern:

```
What's going wrong?
|
+- Input is too long, AI loses focus
|  → Chunk-then-process (Step 3)
|
+- AI conflates multiple similar things
|  → Sequential extraction (Step 4)
|
+- AI misses items in variable-length lists
|  → Identify-then-process (Step 5)
|
+- Different input types need different handling
|  → Classify-then-specialize (see /ai-building-pipelines)
```

You can combine strategies. A long document with variable-length lists might need chunking *and* identify-then-process.

## Step 3: Chunk-then-process

Split long input into overlapping chunks, process each, then deduplicate results.

**When to use:** Input exceeds what the model can reliably process in one pass. Typical signs: accuracy drops sharply as input length grows.

```python
import dspy
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ExtractedItem(BaseModel):
    name: str
    value: str
    source_text: str = Field(description="The exact text this was extracted from")

class ExtractFromChunk(dspy.Signature):
    """Extract all relevant items from this section of the document."""
    chunk: str = dspy.InputField(desc="A section of the document")
    items: list[ExtractedItem] = dspy.OutputField(desc="All items found in this section")

class ChunkAndExtract(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, chunk_size=2000, overlap=200):
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size
        self.overlap = overlap
        self.extract = dspy.ChainOfThought(ExtractFromChunk)

    def _chunk_text(self, text: str) -> list[str]:
        """Split text into overlapping chunks at paragraph boundaries."""
        words = text.split()
        chunks = []
        start = 0
        while start < len(words):
            end = start + self.chunk_size
            chunk = " ".join(words[start:end])
            chunks.append(chunk)
            start = end - self.overlap
        return chunks

    def _deduplicate(self, all_items: list[ExtractedItem]) -> list[ExtractedItem]:
        """Remove duplicate extractions from overlapping chunks."""
        seen = set()
        unique = []
        for item in all_items:
            key = (item.name.lower().strip(), item.value.lower().strip())
            if key not in seen:
                seen.add(key)
                unique.append(item)
        return unique

    def forward(self, document: str):
        chunks = self._chunk_text(document)
        all_items = []

        for chunk in chunks:
            result = self.extract(chunk=chunk)
            all_items.extend(result.items)

        unique_items = self._deduplicate(all_items)
        return dspy.Prediction(items=unique_items)
```

Key details:
- **Overlap** prevents items at chunk boundaries from being split and missed
- **Paragraph-aware splitting** is better than raw character splitting — try to break at `\n\n` boundaries
- **Deduplication** is essential because overlapping chunks will extract the same items twice
- Include `source_text` in the output so you can trace extractions back to the document

## Step 4: Sequential extraction (the Salomatic pattern)

Extract one thing first, then use that result to constrain the next extraction. This is the pattern that took a medical report system from 40% error rate to near-zero.

**When to use:** The AI conflates multiple similar things, or extracting everything at once overwhelms it.

```python
class IdentifyPanels(dspy.Signature):
    """Identify all lab test panels in the medical report."""
    report: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Medical lab report")
    panel_names: list[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="Names of all test panels found")

class LabResult(BaseModel):
    test_name: str
    value: str
    unit: str
    reference_range: str
    flag: str = Field(description="'normal', 'high', or 'low'")

class ExtractPanelResults(dspy.Signature):
    """Extract all test results for a specific panel from the report."""
    report: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Medical lab report")
    panel_name: str = dspy.InputField(desc="The specific panel to extract results for")
    results: list[LabResult] = dspy.OutputField(desc="All test results for this panel")

class SequentialExtractor(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.identify = dspy.ChainOfThought(IdentifyPanels)
        self.extract = dspy.ChainOfThought(ExtractPanelResults)

    def forward(self, report: str):
        # Step 1: Identify what's in the report
        panels = self.identify(report=report)

        dspy.Assert(
            len(panels.panel_names) > 0,
            "No test panels found — is this a valid lab report?"
        )

        # Step 2: Extract results per panel
        all_results = {}
        for panel_name in panels.panel_names:
            result = self.extract(report=report, panel_name=panel_name)
            all_results[panel_name] = result.results

        return dspy.Prediction(
            panels=panels.panel_names,
            results=all_results,
        )
```

Why this works:
- **Step 1 is easy** — just identify panel names (low cognitive load)
- **Step 2 is focused** — extract results for *one specific panel* at a time
- The model doesn't have to juggle "find all panels AND extract all results" simultaneously
- Each extraction is scoped to a smaller, well-defined subtask

This same pattern applies beyond medical reports — any time you're extracting multiple groups of similar things (invoice sections, resume sections, contract clauses).

## Step 5: Identify-then-process

First count or name the items, then process each one individually. This prevents the "missed items" failure where the model extracts 3 of 7 items.

**When to use:** Variable-length lists where the model consistently misses items.

```python
class IdentifyLineItems(dspy.Signature):
    """Identify all line items in the invoice. List every item, even small ones."""
    invoice_text: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Raw invoice text")
    item_descriptions: list[str] = dspy.OutputField(
        desc="Brief description of each line item, in order they appear"
    )

class LineItemDetail(BaseModel):
    description: str
    quantity: int
    unit_price: float
    total: float

class ExtractLineItem(dspy.Signature):
    """Extract the details for a specific line item from the invoice."""
    invoice_text: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Raw invoice text")
    item_description: str = dspy.InputField(desc="The specific item to extract details for")
    details: LineItemDetail = dspy.OutputField()

class IdentifyThenExtract(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.identify = dspy.ChainOfThought(IdentifyLineItems)
        self.extract_item = dspy.ChainOfThought(ExtractLineItem)

    def forward(self, invoice_text: str):
        # Step 1: Identify all items (just names — low cognitive load)
        items = self.identify(invoice_text=invoice_text)

        dspy.Assert(
            len(items.item_descriptions) > 0,
            "No line items found in invoice"
        )

        # Step 2: Extract details per item
        line_items = []
        for desc in items.item_descriptions:
            result = self.extract_item(
                invoice_text=invoice_text,
                item_description=desc,
            )
            line_items.append(result.details)

        return dspy.Prediction(line_items=line_items)
```

The identify step works as an "attention anchor" — once the model has listed all items, the extraction step knows exactly what to look for and is much less likely to skip anything.

## Step 6: Compare single-step vs decomposed

Always measure the improvement. The decomposed version costs more (multiple LM calls), so you need to verify the accuracy gain justifies the cost:

```python
from dspy.evaluate import Evaluate

# Build both versions
single_step = dspy.ChainOfThought(ExtractAllItems)  # Original single-step
decomposed = IdentifyThenExtract()  # Decomposed version

def extraction_metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    """Measure recall — what fraction of gold items were extracted."""
    gold_items = set(item.lower() for item in example.item_names)
    pred_items = set(item.description.lower() for item in prediction.line_items)
    if not gold_items:
        return 1.0
    return len(gold_items & pred_items) / len(gold_items)

evaluator = Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=extraction_metric, num_threads=4, display_table=5)

# Compare
single_score = evaluator(single_step)
decomposed_score = evaluator(decomposed)

print(f"Single-step: {single_score:.1f}%")
print(f"Decomposed:  {decomposed_score:.1f}%")
```

### Stratify by complexity

The real value of decomposition shows on complex inputs. Measure separately:

```python
simple_devset = [ex for ex in devset if len(ex.item_names) <= 3]
complex_devset = [ex for ex in devset if len(ex.item_names) > 3]

simple_evaluator = Evaluate(devset=simple_devset, metric=extraction_metric)
complex_evaluator = Evaluate(devset=complex_devset, metric=extraction_metric)

print("Simple inputs:")
print(f"  Single-step: {simple_evaluator(single_step):.1f}%")
print(f"  Decomposed:  {simple_evaluator(decomposed):.1f}%")

print("Complex inputs:")
print(f"  Single-step: {complex_evaluator(single_step):.1f}%")
print(f"  Decomposed:  {complex_evaluator(decomposed):.1f}%")
```

If the decomposed version doesn't significantly outperform on complex inputs, you may not need the decomposition. Stick with the simpler single-step approach.

## Step 7: Optimize end-to-end

MIPROv2 can optimize all stages of your decomposed pipeline together. This is powerful because the identify step learns to produce outputs that help the extract step:

```python
optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=extraction_metric, auto="medium")
optimized = optimizer.compile(decomposed, trainset=trainset)

# Verify improvement
optimized_score = evaluator(optimized)
print(f"Decomposed (unoptimized): {decomposed_score:.1f}%")
print(f"Decomposed (optimized):   {optimized_score:.1f}%")
```

### Use different models per stage

The identify step (listing items) is simpler than the extract step (pulling details). Use a cheaper model for the easy step:

```python
cheap_lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
quality_lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o")

decomposed.identify.set_lm(cheap_lm)      # Cheap for listing
decomposed.extract_item.set_lm(quality_lm) # Quality for extraction
```

See `/ai-cutting-costs` for more cost strategies.

## Key patterns

- **Decompose when complexity causes failures** — if it works on simple inputs but fails on complex ones, restructure
- **Identify-then-process prevents missed items** — listing first creates an attention anchor
- **Sequential extraction prevents conflation** — extract one type of thing at a time
- **Chunking handles long documents** — overlap chunks and deduplicate results
- **Always compare against single-step** — decomposition costs more, so verify the accuracy gain
- **Stratify by complexity** — the payoff shows on complex inputs, not simple ones
- **Optimize end-to-end** — MIPROv2 tunes all stages together for best results
- **Cheap models for easy stages** — the identify step rarely needs an expensive model
