# Fine-Tune Models on Your Data

Guide the user through deciding whether to fine-tune, preparing data, running fine-tuning with DSPy, distilling to cheaper models, and deploying. Fine-tuning is powerful but expensive — always confirm prerequisites first.

## Should you fine-tune?

Before writing any code, walk through these questions with the user:

1. **Have you optimized prompts first?** If not, use `/ai-improving-accuracy` — prompt optimization is 10x cheaper and often sufficient.
2. **Do you have 500+ labeled examples?** Fine-tuning with less data usually overfits. Collect more data first.
3. **Is your baseline accuracy above 50%?** If your prompt-optimized program is below 50%, your task definition or data has problems. Fix those first.
4. **What's the goal — quality or cost?**
   - **Quality**: You've maxed out prompt optimization and need more accuracy
   - **Cost**: You want a small cheap model to match an expensive one

### When to fine-tune

- You've already optimized prompts with MIPROv2 and hit a ceiling
- You have 500+ labeled examples (1000+ is better)
- Your baseline is >50% and you need to push higher
- You want to distill an expensive model into a cheaper one (10-50x cost savings)
- Your domain has specialized vocabulary or patterns the base model doesn't know
- You need faster inference (smaller fine-tuned models are faster)

### When NOT to fine-tune

- You haven't tried prompt optimization yet — start with `/ai-improving-accuracy`
- You have fewer than 500 examples — need more data? Use `/ai-generating-data` to bootstrap synthetic examples, or use BootstrapFewShot or MIPROv2 instead
- Your baseline is below 50% — your data or task definition needs work
- You're still iterating on what the task is — fine-tuning locks you in
- You don't have a clear metric — you can't evaluate fine-tuning without one
- Your use case changes frequently — fine-tuned models don't adapt to new instructions easily

## Prerequisites checklist

Before starting, confirm:

- [ ] **Data**: 500+ labeled examples (1000+ recommended), split 80/10/10 (train/dev/test)
- [ ] **Baseline**: Prompt-optimized program with measured accuracy (use `/ai-improving-accuracy`)
- [ ] **Metric**: Clear, automated metric that scores predictions
- [ ] **Compute**: API access (OpenAI fine-tuning API) or local GPUs (for open-source models)
- [ ] **Budget**: OpenAI fine-tuning costs ~$0.008/1K tokens for GPT-4o-mini; local needs 1+ GPU

## Step 1: Prepare your data and baseline

### Build a strong baseline first

Always compare fine-tuning against a prompt-optimized baseline:

```python
import dspy

lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o")
dspy.configure(lm=lm)

# Define your program
class Classify(dspy.Signature):
    """Classify the support ticket."""
    text: str = dspy.InputField()
    category: str = dspy.OutputField()

program = dspy.ChainOfThought(Classify)

# Prepare data
import json
with open("labeled_data.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

examples = [dspy.Example(text=x["text"], category=x["category"]).with_inputs("text") for x in data]

# Split: 80% train, 10% dev, 10% test
n = len(examples)
trainset = examples[:int(n * 0.8)]
devset = examples[int(n * 0.8):int(n * 0.9)]
testset = examples[int(n * 0.9):]

# Measure baseline
def metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    return prediction.category.lower() == example.category.lower()

from dspy.evaluate import Evaluate
evaluator = Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=metric, num_threads=4, display_progress=True)
baseline_score = evaluator(program)
print(f"Baseline: {baseline_score:.1f}%")
```

### Optimize prompts first (your comparison point)

```python
optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=metric, auto="medium")
prompt_optimized = optimizer.compile(program, trainset=trainset)
prompt_score = evaluator(prompt_optimized)
print(f"Prompt-optimized: {prompt_score:.1f}%")
```

If prompt optimization gets you to your quality goal, stop here. Fine-tuning is only worth it if you need to go further.

## Step 2: BootstrapFinetune (core fine-tuning)

The main fine-tuning workflow in DSPy. It bootstraps successful reasoning traces from your training data, filters them by your metric, and fine-tunes the model weights.

```python
optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFinetune(metric=metric, num_threads=24)
finetuned = optimizer.compile(program, trainset=trainset)

# Evaluate the fine-tuned model
finetuned_score = evaluator(finetuned)
print(f"Baseline:         {baseline_score:.1f}%")
print(f"Prompt-optimized: {prompt_score:.1f}%")
print(f"Fine-tuned:       {finetuned_score:.1f}%")
```

### How it works

1. **Bootstrap traces**: Runs your program on each training example, keeping traces where the metric passes
2. **Filter by metric**: Only successful traces become training data
3. **Fine-tune weights**: Sends traces to the model provider's fine-tuning API
4. **Return optimized program**: The program now uses the fine-tuned model

### Requirements

- A fine-tunable model (OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`; or local open-source models)
- 500+ training examples (more traces bootstrapped = better fine-tuning)
- A metric that reliably identifies good outputs

## Step 3: Model distillation (expensive to cheap)

Train a small, cheap model to mimic an expensive model. This is the biggest cost saver — 10-50x reduction with 85-95% quality retention.

### Teacher-student pattern

```python
# Step 1: Teacher — expensive model, high quality
teacher_lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o")
dspy.configure(lm=teacher_lm)

# Build and optimize the teacher
teacher = dspy.ChainOfThought(Classify)
optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=metric, auto="medium")
teacher_optimized = optimizer.compile(teacher, trainset=trainset)

teacher_score = evaluator(teacher_optimized)
print(f"Teacher (GPT-4o): {teacher_score:.1f}%")

# Step 2: Student — fine-tune cheap model on teacher's outputs
student_lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.configure(lm=student_lm)

student = dspy.ChainOfThought(Classify)
ft_optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFinetune(metric=metric, num_threads=24)
student_finetuned = ft_optimizer.compile(student, trainset=trainset, teacher=teacher_optimized)

student_score = evaluator(student_finetuned)
print(f"Student (GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned): {student_score:.1f}%")
```

### Typical results

| Model | Quality | Cost per 1M tokens |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| GPT-4o (teacher) | 85% | ~$5.00 |
| GPT-4o-mini (no tuning) | 70% | ~$0.15 |
| GPT-4o-mini (fine-tuned) | 81% | ~$0.15 |

The fine-tuned student costs 33x less and retains ~95% of teacher quality.

## Step 4: BetterTogether (maximum quality)

BetterTogether alternates between prompt optimization and weight optimization, getting more out of both. Based on the BetterTogether paper (arXiv 2407.10930v2), this approach yields 5-78% gains over either technique alone.

```python
optimizer = dspy.BetterTogether(
    metric=metric,
    prompt_optimizer=dspy.MIPROv2,
    weight_optimizer=dspy.BootstrapFinetune,
)
best = optimizer.compile(program, trainset=trainset)

best_score = evaluator(best)
print(f"Prompt-only:    {prompt_score:.1f}%")
print(f"Fine-tune-only: {finetuned_score:.1f}%")
print(f"BetterTogether: {best_score:.1f}%")
```

### How it works

1. **Round 1**: Optimize prompts (instructions + few-shot examples)
2. **Round 2**: Fine-tune weights using the optimized prompts
3. **Round 3**: Re-optimize prompts for the fine-tuned model
4. Each round builds on the previous, creating synergy between prompt and weight optimization

### When to use BetterTogether

- You want the absolute best quality and have the compute budget
- Fine-tuning alone didn't close the gap to your quality target
- You have 500+ examples and a reliable metric

## Step 5: Evaluate and deploy

### Thorough evaluation

Always evaluate on the held-out **test set** (not dev set):

```python
test_evaluator = Evaluate(devset=testset, metric=metric, num_threads=4, display_progress=True)

print(f"Test set results:")
print(f"  Baseline:         {test_evaluator(program):.1f}%")
print(f"  Prompt-optimized: {test_evaluator(prompt_optimized):.1f}%")
print(f"  Fine-tuned:       {test_evaluator(finetuned):.1f}%")
```

### Save and load for production

```python
# Save
finetuned.save("finetuned_program.json")

# Load later
from my_module import MyProgram
production = MyProgram()
production.load("finetuned_program.json")
result = production(text="New support ticket...")
```

## When fine-tuning goes wrong

### Can't bootstrap enough traces

If the base model fails on most training examples, there aren't enough successful traces to fine-tune on.

**Fixes:**
- Use a stronger model for bootstrapping (GPT-4o instead of GPT-4o-mini)
- Relax your metric during bootstrapping (accept partial credit)
- Simplify your task (break multi-step into single steps)

### Model overfits (high train accuracy, low test accuracy)

**Fixes:**
- Add more training data
- Reduce fine-tuning epochs (if provider allows)
- Use a larger base model (less prone to overfitting)
- Simplify your output format

### Fine-tuning didn't improve over prompt optimization

**Fixes:**
- Check that bootstrapping produced enough successful traces (need 200+)
- Try BetterTogether instead of BootstrapFinetune alone
- Verify your metric actually correlates with quality
- Try a different base model

## Infrastructure choices

### OpenAI API (easiest)

Works with `gpt-4o-mini` and `gpt-4o`. DSPy handles the fine-tuning API calls automatically:

```python
lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")  # fine-tunable via API
```

- Pros: No GPU needed, simple setup, fast
- Cons: Data sent to OpenAI, ongoing per-token costs, limited model choices

### Local fine-tuning (own your model)

For open-source models (Llama, Mistral, etc.) using LoRA/QLoRA:

```python
lm = dspy.LM("together_ai/meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf")
```

- Pros: Data stays private, no per-token costs after training, full control
- Cons: Needs GPU(s), more setup, slower iteration

### Cloud GPU platforms

AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud, Lambda Labs, or Together AI for training:

- Pros: Scalable, no hardware to manage
- Cons: Costs vary, setup per platform
