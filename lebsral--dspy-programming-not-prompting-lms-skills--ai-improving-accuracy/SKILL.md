# Measure and Improve Your AI

Guide the user through measuring how well their AI works, then systematically improving it. This is a loop: define "good" -> measure -> improve -> verify.

## The Workflow

1. **Define what "good" means** — write a metric
2. **Measure current quality** — run an evaluation
3. **Improve** — choose an optimizer, run it
4. **Verify** — re-evaluate to confirm improvement
5. **Iterate or ship**

## Step 1: Define what "good" means (write a metric)

A metric takes an expected answer and the AI's answer, and returns a score.

### Exact match (simplest)

```python
def metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    return prediction.answer == example.answer
```

### Normalized match (handles capitalization/whitespace)

```python
def metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    return prediction.answer.strip().lower() == example.answer.strip().lower()
```

### Partial credit (for multi-field outputs)

```python
def metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    fields = ["name", "email", "phone"]
    correct = sum(
        1 for f in fields
        if getattr(prediction, f, "").lower() == getattr(example, f, "").lower()
    )
    return correct / len(fields)
```

### F1 score (for text overlap)

```python
def metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    gold_tokens = set(example.answer.lower().split())
    pred_tokens = set(prediction.answer.lower().split())
    if not gold_tokens or not pred_tokens:
        return float(gold_tokens == pred_tokens)
    precision = len(gold_tokens & pred_tokens) / len(pred_tokens)
    recall = len(gold_tokens & pred_tokens) / len(gold_tokens)
    if precision + recall == 0:
        return 0.0
    return 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
```

### AI-as-judge (for open-ended tasks)

When exact match is too strict (summaries, creative tasks, open-ended Q&A):

```python
class AssessQuality(dspy.Signature):
    """Assess if the predicted answer is correct and complete."""
    question: str = dspy.InputField()
    gold_answer: str = dspy.InputField()
    predicted_answer: str = dspy.InputField()
    is_correct: bool = dspy.OutputField()

def metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    judge = dspy.Predict(AssessQuality)
    result = judge(
        question=example.question,
        gold_answer=example.answer,
        predicted_answer=prediction.answer,
    )
    return result.is_correct
```

### Composite metric (multiple criteria)

```python
def metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    correct = float(prediction.answer.lower() == example.answer.lower())
    concise = float(len(prediction.answer.split()) < 50)
    has_reasoning = float(len(getattr(prediction, 'reasoning', '')) > 20)
    return 0.7 * correct + 0.2 * concise + 0.1 * has_reasoning
```

### Training-aware metric

The `trace` parameter is not `None` during optimization. Use it for stricter requirements during training:

```python
def metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    correct = prediction.answer == example.answer
    if trace is not None:
        # During optimization, also require good reasoning
        has_reasoning = len(prediction.reasoning) > 50
        return correct and has_reasoning
    return correct
```

## Step 2: Measure current quality (run evaluation)

### Prepare test data

If you don't have enough examples, use `/ai-generating-data` to generate synthetic training data.

```python
import dspy

# Manual creation
devset = [
    dspy.Example(question="What is DSPy?", answer="A framework for LM programs").with_inputs("question"),
    # 20-100+ examples for reliable evaluation
]

# From CSV/JSON
import json
with open("test_data.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)
devset = [dspy.Example(**x).with_inputs("question") for x in data]

# From HuggingFace
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("squad", split="validation[:100]")
devset = [
    dspy.Example(question=x["question"], answer=x["answers"]["text"][0]).with_inputs("question")
    for x in dataset
]
```

### Run evaluation

```python
from dspy.evaluate import Evaluate

evaluator = Evaluate(
    devset=devset,
    metric=metric,
    num_threads=4,
    display_progress=True,
    display_table=5,   # show 5 example results
)

baseline_score = evaluator(my_program)
print(f"Baseline: {baseline_score}")
```

## Step 3: Improve (choose an optimizer)

### Quick guide: which optimizer?

| Training examples | Recommended optimizer | Expected improvement | Typical cost |
|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| <20 | GEPA (instruction tuning) | 5-15% | ~$0.50 |
| 20-50 | BootstrapFewShot | 5-20% | ~$0.50-2 |
| 50-200 | BootstrapFewShot, then MIPROv2 | 15-35% | ~$2-10 |
| 200-500 | MIPROv2 (auto="medium") | 20-40% | ~$5-15 |
| 50+ | VizPy ContraPrompt / PromptGrad | 5-18% | ~$0 (free tier) |
| 500+ | MIPROv2 (auto="heavy") or BootstrapFinetune | 25-50% | ~$15-50+ |

```
Start here
|
+- Just getting started (<50 examples)? -> BootstrapFewShot
|   Quick, cheap, usually gives a solid boost.
|
+- Want better prompts (50+ examples)? -> MIPROv2
|   Optimizes both instructions and examples.
|   Best general-purpose prompt optimizer.
|
+- Want to tune instructions only (<50 examples)? -> GEPA
|   Good when you have few examples.
|
+- Need maximum quality (500+ examples)? -> BootstrapFinetune
|   Fine-tunes the model weights.
|   Best for production with smaller/cheaper models.
|
+- Want to combine approaches? -> BetterTogether
    Jointly optimizes prompts and weights.
```

**Stacking tip:** Run BootstrapFewShot first, then MIPROv2 on the result. This often beats either alone — bootstrap finds good examples, then MIPRO refines the instructions.

Optimized prompts are model-specific. If you change models, re-run your optimizer. See `/ai-switching-models`.

### BootstrapFewShot (start here)

Fast, cheap. Finds good examples by running your program and keeping successful traces.

```python
optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(
    metric=metric,
    max_bootstrapped_demos=4,
    max_labeled_demos=4,
)
optimized = optimizer.compile(my_program, trainset=trainset)
```

**Cost:** Minimal (one pass through trainset). **Expected improvement:** 5-20%.

### MIPROv2 (recommended for most cases)

Optimizes both instructions and examples. Best general-purpose optimizer.

```python
optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(
    metric=metric,
    auto="medium",    # "light", "medium", "heavy"
)
optimized = optimizer.compile(my_program, trainset=trainset)
```

- `"light"`: Quick, ~$1-2
- `"medium"`: Balanced, ~$5-10
- `"heavy"`: Thorough, ~$15-30

**Expected improvement:** 15-35%.

### GEPA (instruction tuning)

Good with few examples or when you want to focus on instruction quality:

```python
optimizer = dspy.GEPA()
optimized = optimizer.compile(my_program, trainset=trainset, metric=metric)
```

### VizPy (third-party alternative)

VizPy is a commercial prompt optimizer that offers ContraPromptOptimizer (classification) and PromptGradOptimizer (generation). Like GEPA, it optimizes instructions only — not few-shot demos or Pydantic field descriptions. Free tier includes 10 optimization runs/month.

For setup, usage, and a comparison with GEPA/MIPROv2, see `/dspy-vizpy`.

### BootstrapFinetune (maximum quality)

Fine-tunes model weights for the biggest accuracy gains. Requires 500+ examples and a fine-tunable model:

```python
optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFinetune(metric=metric, num_threads=24)
optimized = optimizer.compile(my_program, trainset=trainset)
```

For the full fine-tuning workflow (decision framework, prerequisites, model distillation, BetterTogether), see `/ai-fine-tuning`.

### When optimization plateaus

If your score stops improving, check these common causes:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Score stuck at 60-70% despite optimization | Task too complex for single step | `/ai-decomposing-tasks` — break into subtasks |
| Optimizer overfits (train score high, dev score flat) | Too little training data | `/ai-generating-data` — generate more examples |
| Score varies wildly between runs | Non-deterministic metric or small devset | Increase devset to 100+, set temperature=0 |
| Diminishing returns from more demos | Prompt is maxed out; model is the limit | `/ai-switching-models` — try a more capable model |
| Score high but real users complain | Metric doesn't match real quality | Rewrite metric based on actual failure patterns |

## Step 4: Verify improvement

```python
optimized_score = evaluator(optimized)
print(f"Baseline: {baseline_score:.1f}%")
print(f"Optimized: {optimized_score:.1f}%")
print(f"Improvement: {optimized_score - baseline_score:.1f}%")
```

## Step 5: Save and ship

```python
optimized.save("optimized_program.json")

# Load later
my_program = MyProgram()
my_program.load("optimized_program.json")
```

## Key patterns

- **Start simple**: exact match metric + BootstrapFewShot, then upgrade if needed
- **Validate your metric**: manually check 10-20 examples to make sure the metric scores correctly
- **More data helps**: optimizers work better with more training examples
- **Never evaluate on trainset**: always use a held-out devset
- **Use `display_table`**: looking at actual predictions reveals metric bugs
- **Iterate**: run optimization, check results, improve metric, re-optimize
