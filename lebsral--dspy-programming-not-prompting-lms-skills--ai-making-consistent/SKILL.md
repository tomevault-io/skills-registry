# Make Your AI Consistent

Guide the user through making their AI give reliable, predictable outputs. This is different from "wrong answers" — the AI might be right 80% of the time but unpredictably different each run.

## Step 1: Diagnose the inconsistency

Ask the user:
1. **What's varying?** (the answer itself, the format, the length, the level of detail?)
2. **How bad is it?** (slightly different wording vs. completely different answers)
3. **Does it matter for your use case?** (sometimes variation is fine, sometimes it breaks downstream code)

### Quick test: run the same input 5 times

```python
import dspy

lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.configure(lm=lm)

for i in range(5):
    result = my_program(question="What is the capital of France?")
    print(f"Run {i+1}: {result.answer}")
```

If outputs vary, apply the fixes below in order.

## Step 2: Set temperature to 0

The single biggest consistency fix. Temperature controls randomness — set it to 0 for deterministic outputs:

```python
lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
```

This alone fixes most consistency issues. Some providers may still have slight variation even at temperature=0 due to floating point non-determinism, but it's minimal.

## Step 3: Constrain output types

Loose output types = more room for variation. Lock them down.

### Use `Literal` for fixed categories

```python
from typing import Literal

class Classify(dspy.Signature):
    """Classify the text."""
    text: str = dspy.InputField()
    # BAD: label: str — AI can say "positive", "Positive", "pos", "POSITIVE", etc.
    # GOOD: locked to exact values
    label: Literal["positive", "negative", "neutral"] = dspy.OutputField()
```

### Use Pydantic models for structured output

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class StructuredOutput(BaseModel):
    category: str
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    tags: list[str]

class MySignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Process the input."""
    text: str = dspy.InputField()
    result: StructuredOutput = dspy.OutputField()
```

Pydantic validates the output structure, catching format inconsistencies.

### Use `bool` and `int` for simple outputs

```python
class CheckFact(dspy.Signature):
    """Is this statement true?"""
    statement: str = dspy.InputField()
    is_true: bool = dspy.OutputField()  # Only True or False — no variation
```

## Step 4: Add output constraints with assertions

Use `dspy.Assert` for hard requirements and `dspy.Suggest` for soft preferences:

```python
class ConsistentResponder(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.respond = dspy.ChainOfThought(MySignature)

    def forward(self, text):
        result = self.respond(text=text)

        # Hard constraint — retry if violated
        dspy.Assert(
            len(result.answer) < 200,
            "Answer must be under 200 characters"
        )

        # Soft constraint — hint to improve
        dspy.Suggest(
            result.answer.endswith("."),
            "Answer should end with a period"
        )

        return result
```

### Common consistency assertions

```python
# Length constraints
dspy.Assert(len(result.answer.split()) <= 50, "Keep answer under 50 words")

# Format constraints
dspy.Assert(result.answer[0].isupper(), "Answer should start with a capital letter")

# Content constraints
dspy.Assert(
    not any(word in result.answer.lower() for word in ["maybe", "perhaps", "i think"]),
    "Answer should be definitive, not hedging"
)
```

## Step 5: Optimize to lock in patterns

Optimization teaches the AI consistent patterns through examples. Even a simple `BootstrapFewShot` run dramatically improves consistency:

```python
# The few-shot examples teach the AI what "good" looks like,
# including format, length, and style
optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(
    metric=metric,
    max_bootstrapped_demos=4,
)
optimized = optimizer.compile(my_program, trainset=trainset)
```

For best consistency, make your metric penalize inconsistency:

```python
def consistency_metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    correct = prediction.answer.lower() == example.answer.lower()
    # Penalize answers that are too long or too short
    right_length = 5 <= len(prediction.answer.split()) <= 30
    # Penalize hedging language
    no_hedging = not any(w in prediction.answer.lower() for w in ["maybe", "perhaps"])
    return correct and right_length and no_hedging
```

## Step 6: Use caching for identical inputs

DSPy caches LM calls by default. For identical inputs, you'll always get the same output:

```python
# First call — hits the API
result1 = my_program(question="What is Python?")

# Second call with same input — returns cached result (instant, identical)
result2 = my_program(question="What is Python?")

# result1 and result2 are guaranteed identical
```

## Consistency checklist

1. Set `temperature=0`
2. Use `Literal` types for categorical outputs
3. Use Pydantic models for structured outputs
4. Use `bool`/`int` for simple yes/no or numeric outputs
5. Add `dspy.Assert` for format constraints
6. Optimize with BootstrapFewShot to lock in patterns
7. Rely on caching for repeated identical inputs
