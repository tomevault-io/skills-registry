# Know When Your AI Breaks in Production

Guide the user through monitoring AI quality, safety, and cost in production. The pattern: log predictions, evaluate periodically, alert on degradation.

## When you need monitoring

- Any AI feature running in production
- After launching something built with the other skills
- After any model or prompt change
- When compliance requires ongoing evidence that AI works correctly
- When you can't afford to discover problems from customer complaints

## What can go wrong (without monitoring)

| Problem | How it happens | Impact |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Silent model changes | Provider updates model behavior | Accuracy drops, nobody notices for weeks |
| Input drift | Users start asking questions you didn't train for | Quality degrades on new use cases |
| Gradual degradation | Prompts rot as data distribution shifts | Slow decline — death by a thousand cuts |
| Cost creep | Longer inputs, more retries, price increases | Budget overrun |
| Safety gaps | New attack vectors, new harmful content patterns | Compliance and reputation risk |

## Step 1: Define what to monitor

Ask the user what matters most:

| Category | What to measure | How |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Quality | Accuracy, relevance, helpfulness | Metrics from `/ai-improving-accuracy` |
| Safety | Policy violations, harmful outputs, PII leaks | LM-as-judge or rule-based checks |
| Performance | Latency, error rate, retry rate | Timing and exception logging |
| Cost | Tokens per request, cost per request, daily spend | Token counting from LM responses |

## Step 2: Build evaluation metrics

Reuse the metric patterns from `/ai-improving-accuracy`:

### Quality metric (with ground truth)

```python
import dspy

def quality_metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    return prediction.answer.strip().lower() == example.answer.strip().lower()
```

### Quality metric (without ground truth — LM-as-judge)

Most production systems don't have ground truth for every request. Use an LM to judge quality:

```python
class AssessQuality(dspy.Signature):
    """Is this a high-quality response to the question?"""
    question: str = dspy.InputField()
    response: str = dspy.InputField()
    is_high_quality: bool = dspy.OutputField()
    issue: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="what's wrong, if anything")

def quality_judge(example, prediction, trace=None):
    judge = dspy.Predict(AssessQuality)
    result = judge(question=example.question, response=prediction.answer)
    return float(result.is_high_quality)
```

### Safety metric

```python
class SafetyCheck(dspy.Signature):
    """Does this response violate any safety policies?"""
    question: str = dspy.InputField()
    response: str = dspy.InputField()
    is_safe: bool = dspy.OutputField()
    violation: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="what policy was violated, if any")

def safety_metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    judge = dspy.Predict(SafetyCheck)
    result = judge(question=example.question, response=prediction.answer)
    return float(result.is_safe)
```

## Step 3: Run batch evaluations

Periodically evaluate your program on a reference dataset:

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime
from dspy.evaluate import Evaluate

def run_evaluation(program, eval_set, metrics):
    """Run all metrics and log results."""
    results = {}
    for name, metric_fn in metrics.items():
        evaluator = Evaluate(devset=eval_set, metric=metric_fn, num_threads=4)
        score = evaluator(program)
        results[name] = score

    # Log results with timestamp
    entry = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "scores": results,
    }
    with open("monitoring_log.jsonl", "a") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(entry) + "\n")

    return results

# Define your metrics
metrics = {
    "quality": quality_judge,
    "safety": safety_metric,
}

# Run evaluation
scores = run_evaluation(my_program, eval_set, metrics)
print(scores)
# {"quality": 87.0, "safety": 99.0}
```

## Step 4: Detect degradation

Compare current scores against a baseline to catch drops early:

```python
def check_for_degradation(current_scores, baseline_scores, threshold=0.05):
    """Alert if any metric drops more than threshold below baseline."""
    alerts = []
    for metric_name, current in current_scores.items():
        baseline = baseline_scores.get(metric_name, 0)
        drop = baseline - current
        if drop > threshold:
            alerts.append(
                f"{metric_name}: dropped {drop:.1%} "
                f"(was {baseline:.1%}, now {current:.1%})"
            )
    return alerts

# Example usage
baseline = {"quality": 0.87, "safety": 0.99}
current = {"quality": 0.75, "safety": 0.98}

alerts = check_for_degradation(current, baseline)
# ["quality: dropped 12.0% (was 87.0%, now 75.0%)"]
```

Set different thresholds for different metrics:
- **Safety:** alert on any drop >1% (zero tolerance)
- **Quality:** alert on drops >5% (some variance is normal)
- **Cost:** alert on increases >20%

## Step 5: Log predictions in production

Wrap your production program to log inputs and outputs for later analysis:

```python
class MonitoredProgram(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, program, log_path="predictions.jsonl"):
        self.program = program
        self.log_path = log_path

    def forward(self, **kwargs):
        import time
        start = time.time()

        result = self.program(**kwargs)

        latency = time.time() - start

        # Log for monitoring
        entry = {
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "inputs": {k: str(v) for k, v in kwargs.items()},
            "outputs": {k: str(getattr(result, k, "")) for k in result.keys()},
            "latency_ms": round(latency * 1000),
        }
        with open(self.log_path, "a") as f:
            f.write(json.dumps(entry) + "\n")

        return result

# Wrap your production program
production = MonitoredProgram(optimized_program)

# Use it normally — logging happens automatically
result = production(question="How do I reset my password?")
```

## Step 6: Sample and evaluate production traffic

Periodically sample logged predictions and run metrics on them:

```python
import random

def sample_and_evaluate(log_path, metric_fns, sample_size=100):
    """Sample recent predictions and evaluate quality."""
    with open(log_path) as f:
        entries = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

    recent = entries[-1000:]  # last 1000 predictions
    sample = random.sample(recent, min(sample_size, len(recent)))

    # Convert to dspy.Examples for evaluation
    examples = []
    for entry in sample:
        ex = dspy.Example(
            question=entry["inputs"].get("question", ""),
            answer=entry["outputs"].get("answer", ""),
        ).with_inputs("question")
        examples.append(ex)

    # Run each metric
    results = {}
    for name, metric_fn in metric_fns.items():
        evaluator = Evaluate(devset=examples, metric=metric_fn, num_threads=4)
        # Create a passthrough program that returns the logged prediction
        score = evaluator(lambda **kw: dspy.Prediction(answer=kw.get("answer", "")))
        results[name] = score

    return results
```

## Step 7: Set up alerts

Simple threshold-based alerting that integrates with your existing tools:

```python
def monitoring_check(program, eval_set, metrics, baseline):
    """Run one monitoring cycle: evaluate, compare, alert."""
    scores = run_evaluation(program, eval_set, metrics)
    alerts = check_for_degradation(scores, baseline)

    if alerts:
        alert_message = "AI quality degradation detected:\n" + "\n".join(alerts)
        # Send to wherever your team gets alerts
        send_to_slack(alert_message)     # or email, PagerDuty, etc.
        print(f"ALERT: {alert_message}")
    else:
        print(f"All metrics healthy: {scores}")

    return scores
```

### Schedule it

Run monitoring checks on a schedule. How often depends on traffic and risk:

| Traffic | Risk level | Suggested frequency |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| High (>10K req/day) | High (safety-critical) | Every hour |
| High | Medium | Every 6 hours |
| Medium (1-10K/day) | Any | Daily |
| Low (<1K/day) | Any | Weekly |

```python
# Run as a cron job, scheduled task, or in your CI pipeline
# Example: daily check
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from my_app import production_program, eval_set

    baseline = {"quality": 0.87, "safety": 0.99}
    metrics = {"quality": quality_judge, "safety": safety_metric}

    monitoring_check(production_program, eval_set, metrics, baseline)
```

## Step 5b: Connect an observability platform

For teams that want dashboards, alerts, and collaboration beyond DIY JSONL logging:

### Quick setup

| Platform | Setup | Open source | DSPy integration |
|----------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Langtrace | `langtrace.init(api_key="...")` | Yes (self-host) + cloud | Auto-instruments all DSPy calls |
| Arize Phoenix | `px.launch_app()` + `DSPyInstrumentor().instrument()` | Yes | Auto-instruments via OpenInference |
| W&B Weave | `weave.init("project")` + `@weave.op()` decorator | No (cloud) | Manual decorator per function |

### Langtrace (best DSPy auto-instrumentation)

```bash
pip install langtrace-python-sdk
```

```python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace

langtrace.init(api_key="your-key")  # or self-host: langtrace.init(api_host="http://localhost:3000")

# All DSPy LM calls, retrievals, and module executions are traced automatically
result = production_program(question="How do refunds work?")
```

### Arize Phoenix (open-source trace viewer)

```bash
pip install arize-phoenix openinference-instrumentation-dspy
```

```python
import phoenix as px
from openinference.instrumentation.dspy import DSPyInstrumentor

px.launch_app()  # Local UI at http://localhost:6006
DSPyInstrumentor().instrument()

# Traces appear in the Phoenix UI with full prompt/response details
```

### W&B Weave (team dashboards)

```bash
pip install weave
```

```python
import weave

weave.init("my-ai-project")

@weave.op()
def monitored_predict(question):
    return production_program(question=question)

# All calls tracked with inputs, outputs, latency, and cost
# View at wandb.ai
```

### Which platform to use

| Your situation | Recommended |
|---------------|------------|
| Solo developer, want quick DSPy tracing | Langtrace |
| Team wants open-source, self-hosted | Arize Phoenix |
| Team already uses W&B for ML experiments | W&B Weave |
| Need per-request debugging (not aggregate) | See `/ai-tracing-requests` |

For in-depth guides on each platform, see: `/dspy-langtrace`, `/dspy-phoenix`, `/dspy-weave`.

## When things go wrong

Quick decision tree for common monitoring alerts:

| Alert | Likely cause | Fix with |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Quality dropped | Model provider changed behavior, or input distribution shifted | `/ai-improving-accuracy` — re-evaluate and re-optimize |
| Safety metric dropped | New attack vectors or content patterns | `/ai-testing-safety` — run adversarial audit, then fix with `/ai-checking-outputs` |
| Cost spiked | Longer inputs, more retries, or model price increase | `/ai-cutting-costs` — investigate and optimize |
| Error rate increased | API changes, schema changes, rate limits | `/ai-fixing-errors` — diagnose and fix |
| Latency increased | Model congestion, larger inputs, or added retries | Check retry rates first, then consider `/ai-switching-models` |

## Tips

- **Set up monitoring at launch, not after an incident.** The cost of monitoring is low; the cost of missing a regression is high.
- **Use LM-as-judge metrics when you don't have ground truth.** Most production cases won't have labeled answers — an LM judge is good enough to detect degradation.
- **Log everything:** inputs, outputs, latencies, token counts, costs. You can always analyze later, but you can't retroactively log what you didn't capture.
- **Separate safety from quality monitoring.** Safety alerts need lower thresholds (>1% drop) and faster response times than quality alerts (>5% drop).
- **Run the full safety audit monthly.** Periodic metric checks catch gradual degradation. Monthly `/ai-testing-safety` audits catch new attack vectors.
- **Keep your reference eval set fresh.** Add examples from real production failures. Remove examples that no longer represent your users.
- **Baseline after every optimization.** When you re-optimize your program, update the baseline scores so future comparisons are meaningful.
