# Build an AI Data Parser

Guide the user through building AI that pulls structured data out of messy text. Uses DSPy extraction — define the output shape, and the AI fills it in.

## Step 1: Define what to extract

Ask the user:
1. **What are you parsing?** (emails, invoices, resumes, transcripts, articles, forms, etc.)
2. **What fields do you need?** (names, dates, amounts, entities, etc.)
3. **Are any fields optional?** (some documents might not have every field)
4. **What's the output format?** (flat fields, list of objects, nested structure)
5. **Do you have examples of correct extractions?** (even a few help with optimization)

## Step 2: Build the parser

### Simple field extraction

For pulling a known set of fields from text:

```python
import dspy

# Configure any LM provider
lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")  # or "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", etc.
dspy.configure(lm=lm)

class ParseContact(dspy.Signature):
    """Extract contact information from the text."""
    text: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Text containing contact information")
    name: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Person's full name")
    email: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Email address")
    phone: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Phone number")

parser = dspy.ChainOfThought(ParseContact)
```

`ChainOfThought` adds reasoning before extraction, which helps the model think through which text maps to which field — typically 5-15% more accurate than bare `Predict` on ambiguous inputs.

### Structured output with Pydantic

For complex or nested output, use Pydantic models. DSPy handles the serialization automatically:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional

class Address(BaseModel):
    street: str
    city: str
    state: str
    zip_code: str

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: Optional[int] = None
    email: Optional[str] = None
    address: Address
    skills: list[str]

class ParsePerson(dspy.Signature):
    """Extract person details from the text."""
    text: str = dspy.InputField()
    person: Person = dspy.OutputField()

parser = dspy.ChainOfThought(ParsePerson)
result = parser(text="John Doe, 32, lives at 123 Main St, Springfield IL 62701. Expert in Python and SQL.")
print(result.person)  # Person(name='John Doe', age=32, ...)
```

Use `Optional` for fields that might not appear in every document — this tells the model it's OK to return `None` instead of guessing.

### List extraction

When you need to pull a variable number of items (entities, line items, experiences):

```python
class Entity(BaseModel):
    name: str
    type: str = Field(description="Type: person, organization, location, or date")

class ParseEntities(dspy.Signature):
    """Extract all named entities from the text."""
    text: str = dspy.InputField()
    entities: list[Entity] = dspy.OutputField(desc="All entities found in the text")

parser = dspy.ChainOfThought(ParseEntities)
```

## Step 3: Load your data

### From files

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Single file
text = Path("document.txt").read_text()
result = parser(text=text)

# Directory of files
documents = []
for path in Path("documents/").glob("*.txt"):
    documents.append({"file": path.name, "text": path.read_text()})
```

### From a CSV

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("emails.csv")  # column: body
results = []
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    result = parser(text=row["body"])
    results.append(result.person.model_dump())  # Pydantic → dict

# Save extracted data
pd.DataFrame(results).to_csv("extracted.csv", index=False)
```

### From transcripts (VTT, LiveKit, Recall)

Transcripts are a common parsing source — extracting caller info, action items, decisions, or structured summaries from conversations.

**WebVTT (.vtt) files:**

```python
import re

def load_vtt(path):
    """Extract text from a VTT transcript, stripping timestamps."""
    text = open(path).read()
    lines = [line.strip() for line in text.split("\n")
             if line.strip() and not line.startswith("WEBVTT")
             and not re.match(r"\d{2}:\d{2}", line)
             and not line.strip().isdigit()]
    return " ".join(lines)
```

**LiveKit transcripts:**

```python
import json

def load_livekit_transcript(path):
    """Extract text from a LiveKit transcript JSON export."""
    data = json.load(open(path))
    segments = data.get("segments", data.get("results", []))
    return " ".join(seg.get("text", "") for seg in segments)
```

**Recall.ai transcripts:**

```python
def load_recall_transcript(transcript_data):
    """Extract text from a Recall.ai transcript response."""
    return " ".join(
        entry["words"] for entry in transcript_data if entry.get("words")
    )
```

**Example: extracting structured data from a call transcript:**

```python
class CallSummary(BaseModel):
    caller_name: Optional[str] = None
    issue_summary: str
    resolution: Optional[str] = None
    follow_up_needed: bool
    action_items: list[str]

class ParseCallTranscript(dspy.Signature):
    """Extract structured information from a customer call transcript."""
    transcript: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Full call transcript text")
    summary: CallSummary = dspy.OutputField()

parser = dspy.ChainOfThought(ParseCallTranscript)
transcript = load_livekit_transcript("call_001.json")
result = parser(transcript=transcript)
```

### From Langfuse traces

Extract structured data from AI interactions logged in Langfuse:

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse

langfuse = Langfuse()
traces = langfuse.fetch_traces(limit=100).data

# Parse each trace's input/output for structured fields
for trace in traces:
    if trace.input:
        text = trace.input.get("message", str(trace.input))
        result = parser(text=text)
```

## Step 4: Handle messy data

Real-world text is messy. Use assertions to catch bad extractions and retry:

```python
class ValidatedParser(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.parse = dspy.ChainOfThought(ParseContact)

    def forward(self, text):
        result = self.parse(text=text)
        dspy.Suggest(
            "@" in result.email,
            "Email should contain @"
        )
        dspy.Suggest(
            len(result.phone.replace("-", "").replace(" ", "")) >= 10,
            "Phone number should have at least 10 digits"
        )
        return result
```

`dspy.Suggest` is a soft constraint — if the check fails, DSPy retries the extraction with the suggestion as feedback. Use `dspy.Assert` for hard constraints that should raise an error if they can't be satisfied.

### Handling missing fields

When a field genuinely isn't in the text, you want the model to say so rather than hallucinate a value. Use `Optional` types in your Pydantic model, and add a validation note in the signature docstring:

```python
class ParseContact(dspy.Signature):
    """Extract contact info from the text. Return None for fields not present — do not guess."""
    text: str = dspy.InputField()
    name: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Person's full name")
    email: Optional[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="Email address, or None if not found")
    phone: Optional[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="Phone number, or None if not found")
```

## Step 5: Evaluate quality

```python
from dspy.evaluate import Evaluate

def parsing_metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    """Score based on field-level accuracy (partial credit)."""
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    for field in ["name", "email", "phone"]:
        expected = getattr(example, field, None)
        predicted = getattr(prediction, field, None)
        if expected is not None:
            total += 1
            if predicted and expected.lower().strip() == predicted.lower().strip():
                correct += 1
    return correct / total if total > 0 else 0.0

evaluator = Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=parsing_metric, num_threads=4, display_progress=True)
score = evaluator(parser)
print(f"Baseline accuracy: {score}%")
```

For Pydantic outputs, compare field-by-field or use the model's `.model_dump()` to compare dicts. Partial credit (scoring each field independently) is better than all-or-nothing for extraction tasks — it tells you which specific fields are causing problems.

## Step 6: Optimize and deploy

```python
# Optimize
optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(metric=parsing_metric, max_bootstrapped_demos=4)
optimized = optimizer.compile(parser, trainset=trainset)

# Evaluate improvement
improved = evaluator(optimized)
print(f"Optimized accuracy: {improved}%")

# Save for production
optimized.save("parser.json")

# Load later
parser = dspy.ChainOfThought(ParseContact)
parser.load("parser.json")
```

## Batch processing

For parsing many documents at once:

```python
import json

results = []
errors = []

for doc in documents:
    try:
        result = optimized(text=doc["text"])
        results.append({
            "source": doc["file"],
            **result.person.model_dump()  # flatten Pydantic fields
        })
    except Exception as e:
        errors.append({"source": doc["file"], "error": str(e)})

# Save results
with open("extracted.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=2)

if errors:
    print(f"{len(errors)} documents failed to parse — check errors list")
```

## Gotchas

- **Pydantic models must be JSON-serializable** — avoid custom types, datetime objects, or complex validators in output models. Stick to `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, and nested Pydantic models.
- **Optional fields need explicit `None` defaults** — use `field: Optional[str] = dspy.OutputField(default=None)` or the model will hallucinate values for missing fields instead of returning None.
- **List extraction undercounts by default** — when extracting lists of items (e.g., "all people mentioned"), the LM tends to stop early. Set `max_tokens` higher and add a "be exhaustive" instruction in the signature docstring.
- **Long inputs get truncated silently** — if your input text exceeds the model's context window, DSPy doesn't warn you. Chunk long documents before parsing, or use a model with a larger context window.
- **Nested Pydantic models increase failure rate** — each level of nesting adds extraction difficulty. Flatten where possible, or break into multiple extraction steps (extract outer structure first, then fill in nested fields).
