# Put Your AI Behind an API

Guide the user through wrapping a DSPy program in a web API so other services (or a frontend) can call it over HTTP. Uses FastAPI for the web layer, with clean separation between DSPy logic and API code.

## When you need this

- You built an AI feature and need to serve it as a web endpoint
- You're adding AI capabilities to an existing backend
- Other services need to call your AI over HTTP
- You want to deploy your AI with Docker

## Step 1: Understand the setup

Ask the user:
1. **What DSPy program are you serving?** (classification, RAG, extraction, pipeline, etc.)
2. **Is it optimized?** (do you have an `optimized.json` from `/ai-improving-accuracy`?)
3. **What endpoints do you need?** (single query, batch, health check, etc.)
4. **Do you have an existing web framework?** (FastAPI, Flask, Django — default to FastAPI)

## Step 2: Project structure

Recommended layout — keep DSPy logic separate from API code:

```
project/
├── program.py       # DSPy module (already exists from /ai-kickoff)
├── server.py        # FastAPI app — routes and startup
├── models.py        # Pydantic request/response schemas
├── config.py        # Environment configuration
├── optimized.json   # Saved optimized program (if available)
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile
└── .env.example
```

## Step 3: Define request/response models

Use Pydantic models for all inputs and outputs. This gives you validation, documentation, and serialization for free.

```python
# models.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    """Request to the AI endpoint."""
    query: str = Field(..., description="The input to process", min_length=1)
    # Optional: let callers override the model per request
    model: str | None = Field(None, description="Override the default LM")
    temperature: float | None = Field(None, ge=0, le=2, description="Override temperature")

class QueryResponse(BaseModel):
    """Response from the AI endpoint."""
    answer: str
    # Include whatever your DSPy program outputs
    # reasoning: str | None = None
    # confidence: float | None = None

class HealthResponse(BaseModel):
    status: str = "ok"
    model: str
    optimized: bool
```

Adapt fields to match your DSPy program's inputs and outputs. If your program takes `question` and returns `answer` and `reasoning`, mirror that in the schemas.

## Step 4: Load the optimized program at startup

Load the DSPy program once when the server starts, not on every request. Use FastAPI's lifespan handler:

```python
# server.py
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
import dspy
from fastapi import FastAPI

from program import MyProgram
from config import settings

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    """Load DSPy program once at startup."""
    # Configure the default LM
    lm = dspy.LM(settings.model_name)
    dspy.configure(lm=lm)

    # Load the program (with optimization if available)
    app.state.program = MyProgram()
    app.state.optimized = False
    try:
        app.state.program.load(settings.program_path)
        app.state.optimized = True
        print(f"Loaded optimized program from {settings.program_path}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Running unoptimized program")

    yield  # Server runs here

app = FastAPI(title="My AI API", lifespan=lifespan)
```

**Why lifespan?** Loading a program + configuring an LM takes time. Doing it once at startup means requests are fast. The `app.state` object makes the program available to all route handlers.

## Step 5: Create endpoints

### Query endpoint

```python
# server.py (continued)
from fastapi import HTTPException
from models import QueryRequest, QueryResponse, HealthResponse

@app.post("/query", response_model=QueryResponse)
async def query(request: QueryRequest):
    """Run the AI program on input."""
    program = app.state.program

    # If caller wants a different model, use dspy.context for this request only
    if request.model or request.temperature is not None:
        lm_kwargs = {}
        if request.model:
            lm_kwargs["model"] = request.model
        if request.temperature is not None:
            lm_kwargs["temperature"] = request.temperature
        override_lm = dspy.LM(**lm_kwargs) if request.model else dspy.LM(
            settings.model_name, temperature=request.temperature
        )
        with dspy.context(lm=override_lm):
            result = program(query=request.query)
    else:
        result = program(query=request.query)

    return QueryResponse(answer=result.answer)
```

### Health check

```python
@app.get("/health", response_model=HealthResponse)
async def health():
    return HealthResponse(
        model=settings.model_name,
        optimized=app.state.optimized,
    )
```

### Batch endpoint

For processing multiple inputs at once:

```python
@app.post("/query/batch", response_model=list[QueryResponse])
async def query_batch(requests: list[QueryRequest]):
    """Process multiple inputs."""
    program = app.state.program
    results = []
    for req in requests:
        result = program(query=req.query)
        results.append(QueryResponse(answer=result.answer))
    return results
```

## Step 6: Handle errors

Map DSPy errors to appropriate HTTP status codes:

```python
from dspy.primitives.assertions import DSPyAssertionError

@app.post("/query", response_model=QueryResponse)
async def query(request: QueryRequest):
    program = app.state.program
    try:
        if request.model or request.temperature is not None:
            override_lm = dspy.LM(
                request.model or settings.model_name,
                temperature=request.temperature,
            )
            with dspy.context(lm=override_lm):
                result = program(query=request.query)
        else:
            result = program(query=request.query)
        return QueryResponse(answer=result.answer)

    except DSPyAssertionError as e:
        # AI output failed validation (from dspy.Assert)
        raise HTTPException(status_code=422, detail=f"Output validation failed: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        error_msg = str(e).lower()
        if "rate limit" in error_msg or "429" in error_msg:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=429, detail="Rate limited by AI provider")
        if "timeout" in error_msg:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=504, detail="AI provider timed out")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Internal error processing request")
```

## Step 7: Environment configuration

Use pydantic-settings to manage configuration:

```python
# config.py
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    model_name: str = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
    program_path: str = "optimized.json"
    api_key: str = ""  # Set via environment variable

    model_config = {"env_prefix": "AI_"}

settings = Settings()
```

```
# .env.example
AI_MODEL_NAME=openai/gpt-4o-mini
AI_PROGRAM_PATH=optimized.json
AI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Step 8: Run and deploy

### Run locally

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic-settings
uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for auto-generated API docs.

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "server:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### requirements.txt

```
dspy>=2.5
fastapi>=0.100
uvicorn[standard]
pydantic-settings>=2.0
```

Add provider-specific packages as needed (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`).

### Docker Compose (optional)

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - ./optimized.json:/app/optimized.json:ro
```

## Key patterns

- **Load once, serve many.** Load the program and LM at startup via lifespan, not per request.
- **Pydantic everything.** Request/response models give you validation, docs, and serialization.
- **`dspy.context()` for overrides.** Let callers switch models or temperature without affecting other requests.
- **Separate DSPy from API code.** Keep `program.py` independent — the same module runs in scripts, tests, and the API.
- **Map errors to HTTP codes.** Assertion failures → 422, rate limits → 429, timeouts → 504.

## DSPy-specific production patterns

### Saving and loading optimized programs

After optimization, save the program artifact and load it at deploy time:

```python
# After optimization
optimized_program.save("./artifacts/v1.json")

# At server startup
program = MyProgram()
program.load("./artifacts/v1.json")
```

This is the same `save()`/`load()` API used throughout DSPy — it serializes the optimized prompts, demos, and weights so you don't need the training data or optimizer at deploy time.

### Observability with MLflow

DSPy integrates with MLflow Tracing via OpenTelemetry. Enable it to get per-request traces of every LM call, retrieval, and module step:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.dspy.autolog()  # auto-traces all DSPy calls

# Optionally set an experiment for grouping
mlflow.set_experiment("production-qa-api")
```

This gives you latency breakdowns, token counts, and full prompt/response logs in the MLflow UI — useful for debugging production issues. For the full MLflow guide (experiment tracking, model registry), see `/dspy-mlflow`.

### Reproducibility

Log the configuration alongside your program so you can reproduce results:

```python
import json

config = {
    "model": settings.model_name,
    "program_path": settings.program_path,
    "dspy_version": dspy.__version__,
    "temperature": 0.0,
}
# Write to a file or log to MLflow
with open("./artifacts/config.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(config, f)
```

### Thread safety and async

`dspy.configure()` sets global state. For concurrent request handling, use `dspy.context()` to isolate per-request overrides without affecting other threads:

```python
@app.post("/query")
async def query(request: QueryRequest):
    if request.model:
        with dspy.context(lm=dspy.LM(request.model)):
            result = program(query=request.query)
    else:
        result = program(query=request.query)
    return QueryResponse(answer=result.answer)
```
