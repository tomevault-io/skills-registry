# Build AI That Takes Actions

Guide the user through building AI that reasons and takes actions — calling APIs, using tools, and completing multi-step tasks. Uses DSPy's ReAct and CodeAct agent modules.

## Step 1: Understand the use case

Ask the user:
1. **What should the AI do?** (answer questions, call APIs, perform calculations, search, etc.)
2. **What tools does it need?** (calculator, search, database, APIs, file system, etc.)
3. **How many steps might it take?** (simple tool call vs. multi-step reasoning)

## Step 2: Define tools

Tools are Python functions with type hints and docstrings. DSPy uses these to tell the AI what's available:

```python
def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web for information."""
    # Your search implementation
    return "search results..."

def calculate(expression: str) -> float:
    """Evaluate a mathematical expression."""
    return dspy.PythonInterpreter({}).execute(expression)

def lookup_database(table: str, query: str) -> str:
    """Query the database for records matching the query."""
    # Your database logic
    return "query results..."
```

**Tool requirements:**
- Type hints on all parameters and return type
- Docstring explaining what the tool does
- Return a string (or something that converts to string)

## Step 3: Build the AI

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) — start here

The standard choice. Alternates between thinking and acting:

```python
import dspy

agent = dspy.ReAct(
    "question -> answer",
    tools=[search, calculate],
    max_iters=5,  # max steps before stopping
)

result = agent(question="What is the population of France divided by 3?")
print(result.answer)
```

### CodeAct — for code-heavy tasks

For tasks where writing and executing code is more natural:

```python
agent = dspy.CodeAct(
    "question -> answer",
    tools=[search, calculate],
    max_iters=5,
)

result = agent(question="Calculate the compound interest on $1000 at 5% for 10 years")
print(result.answer)
```

### Custom AI with state

```python
class ResearchBot(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent = dspy.ReAct(
            "question, context -> answer",
            tools=[search, lookup_database],
            max_iters=8,
        )

    def forward(self, question):
        # Add initial context or pre-processing
        context = "Use search for general questions, database for specific records."
        return self.agent(question=question, context=context)
```

## Step 4: Test the quality

```python
def action_metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    # Check if the final answer is correct
    return prediction.answer.strip().lower() == example.answer.strip().lower()

# For open-ended tasks, use an AI judge
class JudgeResult(dspy.Signature):
    """Judge if the AI's answer correctly addresses the question."""
    question: str = dspy.InputField()
    expected: str = dspy.InputField()
    actual: str = dspy.InputField()
    is_correct: bool = dspy.OutputField()

def judge_metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    judge = dspy.Predict(JudgeResult)
    result = judge(
        question=example.question,
        expected=example.answer,
        actual=prediction.answer,
    )
    return result.is_correct
```

## Step 5: Improve accuracy

```python
# Optimize the AI's reasoning prompts
optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(metric=action_metric, max_bootstrapped_demos=4)
optimized = optimizer.compile(agent, trainset=trainset)
```

For action-taking AI, `MIPROv2` often works better since it can optimize the reasoning instructions:

```python
optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=action_metric, auto="medium")
optimized = optimizer.compile(agent, trainset=trainset)
```

## Using LangChain tools

LangChain has 100+ pre-built tools (search engines, Wikipedia, SQL databases, web scrapers, etc.). Convert any of them to DSPy tools with one line:

```python
import dspy
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun, WikipediaQueryRun
from langchain_community.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper

# Convert LangChain tools to DSPy tools
search = dspy.Tool.from_langchain(DuckDuckGoSearchRun())
wikipedia = dspy.Tool.from_langchain(WikipediaQueryRun(api_wrapper=WikipediaAPIWrapper()))

# Use in any DSPy agent
agent = dspy.ReAct(
    "question -> answer",
    tools=[search, wikipedia],
    max_iters=5,
)
```

**When to use LangChain tools vs writing your own:**

| Use LangChain tools when... | Write your own when... |
|------------------------------|------------------------|
| There's an existing tool for it (search, Wikipedia, SQL) | You need custom business logic |
| You want quick prototyping | You need tight error handling |
| The tool wraps a standard API | You're wrapping an internal API |

Install the tools you need:

```bash
pip install langchain-community  # DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, requests, etc.
```

For the full LangChain/LangGraph API reference, see [`docs/langchain-langgraph-reference.md`](../../docs/langchain-langgraph-reference.md).

## Key patterns

- **Start with ReAct** — it's the most general-purpose action module
- **Keep tools simple** — each tool should do one thing well
- **Set `max_iters`** to prevent infinite loops (default is usually fine)
- **Use descriptive docstrings** — the AI uses them to decide when to call each tool
- **Test without optimization first** — action AI often works well zero-shot
- **Add assertions** for safety — use `dspy.Assert` to prevent dangerous tool calls

## Additional resources

- For worked examples (calculator, search, APIs), see [examples.md](examples.md)
- Need multiple agents working together (not just one)? Use `/ai-coordinating-agents`
- Next: `/ai-improving-accuracy` to measure and improve your AI
