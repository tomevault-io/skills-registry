# Track Which Optimization Experiment Was Best

Guide the user through logging, comparing, and managing optimization experiments. The pattern: run experiments systematically, log everything, compare results, promote the winner to production.

## When you need this

- You've run 5+ optimization experiments and lost track of which was best
- "The intern ran experiments, which .json file is the good one?"
- You need to justify to stakeholders why you picked a specific approach
- You want to reproduce last week's best experiment with more data
- You're comparing optimizers, models, or hyperparameters

## How it's different from improving accuracy

| | Improving accuracy (`/ai-improving-accuracy`) | Tracking experiments (this skill) |
|---|---|---|
| Focus | Running a single optimization pass | Managing the full experimental lifecycle |
| Output | An optimized program | A comparison of all runs with the winner promoted |
| Question | "How do I make this better?" | "Which of our 8 optimization runs was best?" |

## Step 1: Understand the setup

Ask the user:
1. **How many experiments have you run?** (2-3 → file-based tracking. 10+ → consider W&B Weave or LangWatch)
2. **What varied between runs?** (optimizer, model, training data, hyperparameters?)
3. **Do you have an existing tracking tool?** (W&B, MLflow, etc.)
4. **Do multiple people run experiments?** (solo → file-based. Team → shared tool)

## Step 2: Lightweight experiment tracking (no extra tools)

A JSONL file is all you need to start. Each line records one experiment run:

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime

EXPERIMENT_LOG = "experiments.jsonl"

def log_experiment(run):
    """Log a single experiment run."""
    run["timestamp"] = datetime.now().isoformat()
    with open(EXPERIMENT_LOG, "a") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(run) + "\n")

def load_experiments(path=EXPERIMENT_LOG):
    """Load all experiment runs."""
    with open(path) as f:
        return [json.loads(line) for line in f]
```

### What to log for each run

```python
run = {
    "name": "mipro-medium-gpt4o-mini",       # Human-readable name
    "optimizer": "MIPROv2",                    # Which optimizer
    "optimizer_config": {"auto": "medium"},    # Optimizer settings
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",            # Which LM
    "trainset_size": 200,                      # Training examples used
    "devset_size": 50,                         # Evaluation examples
    "metric": "answer_quality",                # Which metric
    "score": 0.84,                             # Score on devset
    "baseline_score": 0.65,                    # Score before optimization
    "improvement": 0.19,                       # Delta
    "cost_usd": 4.50,                          # API cost for this run
    "duration_minutes": 12,                    # Wall clock time
    "artifact_path": "artifacts/mipro_medium_gpt4o_mini.json",  # Saved program
    "notes": "Best so far. Instruction quality seems high.",
}
log_experiment(run)
```

## Step 3: Run and log experiments systematically

Template function that runs one experiment end-to-end:

```python
import dspy
import time
from dspy.evaluate import Evaluate

def run_experiment(
    name,
    program_class,
    optimizer_class,
    optimizer_kwargs,
    trainset,
    devset,
    metric,
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    artifact_dir="artifacts",
):
    """Run one optimization experiment and log results."""
    import os
    os.makedirs(artifact_dir, exist_ok=True)

    # Configure
    lm = dspy.LM(model)
    dspy.configure(lm=lm)
    program = program_class()

    # Baseline
    evaluator = Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=metric, num_threads=4)
    baseline_score = evaluator(program)

    # Optimize
    start = time.time()
    optimizer = optimizer_class(**optimizer_kwargs)
    if optimizer_class == dspy.GEPA:
        optimized = optimizer.compile(program, trainset=trainset, metric=metric)
    else:
        optimized = optimizer.compile(program, trainset=trainset)
    duration = (time.time() - start) / 60

    # Evaluate optimized
    score = evaluator(optimized)

    # Save artifact
    artifact_path = f"{artifact_dir}/{name}.json"
    optimized.save(artifact_path)

    # Log
    run = {
        "name": name,
        "optimizer": optimizer_class.__name__,
        "optimizer_config": optimizer_kwargs,
        "model": model,
        "trainset_size": len(trainset),
        "devset_size": len(devset),
        "metric": metric.__name__,
        "baseline_score": baseline_score,
        "score": score,
        "improvement": score - baseline_score,
        "duration_minutes": round(duration, 1),
        "artifact_path": artifact_path,
    }
    log_experiment(run)

    print(f"[{name}] {baseline_score:.1f}% -> {score:.1f}% (+{score - baseline_score:.1f}%)")
    return optimized, run
```

### Run a batch of experiments

```python
experiments = [
    {
        "name": "bootstrap-4demos",
        "optimizer_class": dspy.BootstrapFewShot,
        "optimizer_kwargs": {"metric": metric, "max_bootstrapped_demos": 4},
    },
    {
        "name": "bootstrap-8demos",
        "optimizer_class": dspy.BootstrapFewShot,
        "optimizer_kwargs": {"metric": metric, "max_bootstrapped_demos": 8},
    },
    {
        "name": "mipro-light",
        "optimizer_class": dspy.MIPROv2,
        "optimizer_kwargs": {"metric": metric, "auto": "light"},
    },
    {
        "name": "mipro-medium",
        "optimizer_class": dspy.MIPROv2,
        "optimizer_kwargs": {"metric": metric, "auto": "medium"},
    },
]

results = []
for exp in experiments:
    optimized, run = run_experiment(
        name=exp["name"],
        program_class=MyProgram,
        optimizer_class=exp["optimizer_class"],
        optimizer_kwargs=exp["optimizer_kwargs"],
        trainset=trainset,
        devset=devset,
        metric=metric,
    )
    results.append(run)
```

## Step 4: Compare experiments

### Display comparison table

```python
def compare_experiments(path=EXPERIMENT_LOG, sort_by="score"):
    """Load experiments and display a comparison table."""
    runs = load_experiments(path)
    runs.sort(key=lambda r: r.get(sort_by, 0), reverse=True)

    # Header
    print(f"{'Name':<30} {'Optimizer':<20} {'Model':<22} {'Score':>7} {'Improve':>8} {'Cost':>7}")
    print("-" * 120)

    for r in runs:
        name = r.get("name", "?")[:29]
        opt = r.get("optimizer", "?")[:19]
        model = r.get("model", "?")[:21]
        score = r.get("score", 0)
        improvement = r.get("improvement", 0)
        cost = r.get("cost_usd", 0)

        print(f"{name:<30} {opt:<20} {model:<22} {score:>6.1f}% {improvement:>+7.1f}% ${cost:>5.2f}")

compare_experiments()
# Name                           Optimizer            Model                   Score  Improve    Cost
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# mipro-medium                   MIPROv2              openai/gpt-4o-mini       84.0%   +19.0%  $4.50
# mipro-light                    MIPROv2              openai/gpt-4o-mini       78.0%   +13.0%  $1.20
# bootstrap-8demos               BootstrapFewShot     openai/gpt-4o-mini       74.0%    +9.0%  $0.30
# bootstrap-4demos               BootstrapFewShot     openai/gpt-4o-mini       71.0%    +6.0%  $0.15
```

### Filter experiments

```python
def filter_experiments(path=EXPERIMENT_LOG, **filters):
    """Filter experiments by any field."""
    runs = load_experiments(path)

    for key, value in filters.items():
        if key == "min_score":
            runs = [r for r in runs if r.get("score", 0) >= value]
        elif key == "optimizer":
            runs = [r for r in runs if r.get("optimizer") == value]
        elif key == "model":
            runs = [r for r in runs if r.get("model") == value]

    return runs

# Only MIPROv2 runs
mipro_runs = filter_experiments(optimizer="MIPROv2")

# Runs scoring above 80%
good_runs = filter_experiments(min_score=80.0)
```

## Step 5: Promote best experiment to production

```python
import shutil

def promote_experiment(name, production_path="production/optimized.json"):
    """Copy the winning experiment's artifact to the production path."""
    import os
    runs = load_experiments()

    run = next((r for r in runs if r["name"] == name), None)
    if not run:
        print(f"Experiment '{name}' not found")
        return

    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(production_path), exist_ok=True)
    shutil.copy2(run["artifact_path"], production_path)

    # Log the promotion
    promotion = {
        "event": "promotion",
        "experiment_name": name,
        "score": run["score"],
        "source_artifact": run["artifact_path"],
        "production_path": production_path,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    }
    with open("promotions.jsonl", "a") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(promotion) + "\n")

    print(f"Promoted '{name}' (score: {run['score']:.1f}%) to {production_path}")

# Promote the best experiment
promote_experiment("mipro-medium")
# Promoted 'mipro-medium' (score: 84.0%) to production/optimized.json
```

### Load the promoted program in production

```python
# In your production code
program = MyProgram()
program.load("production/optimized.json")
```

## Step 6: Use W&B Weave (for teams)

For teams running many experiments, W&B Weave adds visual dashboards and collaboration:

```bash
pip install weave
```

```python
import weave

weave.init("my-project")

@weave.op()
def run_optimization(optimizer_name, model, trainset, devset, metric):
    """Tracked optimization run — Weave logs inputs, outputs, and cost."""
    lm = dspy.LM(model)
    dspy.configure(lm=lm)

    program = MyProgram()
    optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=metric, auto="medium")
    optimized = optimizer.compile(program, trainset=trainset)

    evaluator = Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=metric, num_threads=4)
    score = evaluator(optimized)

    return {"score": score, "optimizer": optimizer_name, "model": model}

# Weave auto-tracks everything — view at wandb.ai
result = run_optimization("mipro-medium", "openai/gpt-4o-mini", trainset, devset, metric)
```

For in-depth Weave setup, see `/dspy-weave`. For MLflow experiment tracking, see `/dspy-mlflow`.

## Step 7: Use LangWatch (for real-time optimizer progress)

LangWatch shows optimizer progress as it runs — useful for long optimization runs:

```bash
pip install langwatch
```

```python
import langwatch

langwatch.init()

# LangWatch tracks DSPy optimizer steps in real-time
optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=metric, auto="heavy")
optimized = optimizer.compile(program, trainset=trainset)
# Watch progress at app.langwatch.ai
```

For the full LangWatch guide (auto-tracing, optimizer dashboard, self-hosted), see `/dspy-langwatch`.

## Key patterns

- **Log from day one**: even if you only have 2 experiments now, you'll have 20 next month
- **Log the artifact path**: an experiment without a saved .json file is useless
- **Compare on the same devset**: scores from different devsets aren't comparable
- **Track cost**: "20% better accuracy for 10x the cost" is a real tradeoff
- **Promote explicitly**: don't just copy files — log which experiment is in production
- **Start file-based, upgrade later**: JSONL tracking works fine until you have a team
