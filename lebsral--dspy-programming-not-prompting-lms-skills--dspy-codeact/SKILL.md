description: Use when the agent's task is best solved by writing and executing Python code — data manipulation, computation, file processing, or tasks where code is more reliable than natural language reasoning. Common scenarios: data analysis tasks where the agent writes pandas code, computation-heavy tasks where natural language reasoning fails, file processing automation, tasks requiring precise calculations, or building agents that manipulate data programmatically.

# Build Agents That Write and Execute Code with dspy.CodeAct

Guide the user through building DSPy agents that solve problems by generating and running Python code, rather than calling tools through a fixed interface.

## What is CodeAct

`dspy.CodeAct` is a DSPy module that creates agents which write Python code to accomplish tasks. Instead of selecting from a predefined set of tool calls (like ReAct), CodeAct generates executable code snippets that use provided tools as Python functions.

The agent works in a loop:

1. **Generate** -- the LM writes a Python code snippet using the available tools
2. **Execute** -- the code runs in a sandboxed interpreter
3. **Observe** -- the agent sees the output and decides whether the task is done
4. **Repeat** -- if not done, writes more code incorporating previous results

CodeAct inherits from both ReAct and ProgramOfThought, combining reasoning-and-acting with code generation.

## How CodeAct differs from ReAct

| | ReAct | CodeAct |
|---|---|---|
| **How it acts** | Calls tools by name with arguments | Writes Python code that calls tools |
| **Composition** | One tool call per step | Can chain multiple tool calls, use loops, variables, conditionals in a single step |
| **Data manipulation** | Limited to what tools return | Can transform, filter, aggregate data in code |
| **Best for** | Simple tool orchestration | Complex computation, data processing, multi-step logic |
| **Overhead** | Lower -- just picks a tool | Higher -- generates and executes code |

**Rule of thumb:** If your agent needs to do math, transform data, or chain several operations together, CodeAct is a better fit. If it just needs to look things up and combine results, ReAct is simpler.

## When to use CodeAct

Use CodeAct when the agent needs to:

- **Do computation** -- math, aggregations, statistics, string processing
- **Transform data** -- reshape, filter, combine results from multiple tool calls
- **Write multi-step logic** -- loops, conditionals, variable assignment between steps
- **Solve problems programmatically** -- tasks where the approach itself needs to be figured out

Avoid CodeAct when:

- Simple tool calls are sufficient (use ReAct instead)
- You need tight control over exactly which tools are called and in what order
- The execution environment cannot support sandboxed code execution
- You need to use external libraries like numpy or pandas inside tools (CodeAct tools cannot import external libraries)

## Basic usage

```python
import dspy

lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.configure(lm=lm)

# Define tools as pure functions with type hints and docstrings
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """Calculate the factorial of n."""
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the nth Fibonacci number."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

# Create the CodeAct agent
agent = dspy.CodeAct(
    "question -> answer",
    tools=[factorial, fibonacci],
    max_iters=5,
)

result = agent(question="What is the factorial of 10 plus the 15th Fibonacci number?")
print(result.answer)
```

## Constructor parameters

```python
dspy.CodeAct(
    signature,          # str or dspy.Signature -- defines input/output fields
    tools,              # list[callable] -- pure functions the agent can call in code
    max_iters=5,        # int -- max generate-execute cycles before stopping
    interpreter=None,   # PythonInterpreter or None -- custom interpreter (creates one if None)
)
```

### Parameter details

- **`signature`** -- same as any DSPy module. Defines what the agent receives and what it should produce.
- **`tools`** -- a list of Python functions. Must be **pure functions** (not callable objects or class instances). All dependencies must be self-contained within each function -- tools cannot import external libraries or reference outside state.
- **`max_iters`** -- safety limit on how many code-generation-and-execution cycles the agent runs. Default is 5. Increase for complex multi-step tasks, decrease for simple ones.
- **`interpreter`** -- optionally pass a pre-configured `dspy.PythonInterpreter`. If `None`, CodeAct creates a fresh one. The interpreter runs code in a sandboxed Deno-based environment.

## Tool requirements

CodeAct is strict about what tools it accepts:

```python
# OK -- pure function
def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search for information."""
    return "results..."

# OK -- function with multiple parameters
def lookup(table: str, key: str) -> str:
    """Look up a value in a table."""
    return "value..."

# NOT OK -- callable object (will be rejected)
class MyTool:
    def __call__(self, query: str) -> str:
        return "results..."

# NOT OK -- tool that imports external libraries
def analyze(data: str) -> str:
    """Analyze data."""
    import pandas as pd  # This will fail in the sandbox
    return str(pd.read_csv(data))
```

**Rules for tools:**

1. Must be plain functions (not callable objects, not class methods)
2. Must have type hints and a docstring
3. Cannot import external libraries (numpy, pandas, requests, etc.) inside the function body
4. All logic must be self-contained -- no references to external classes or global state
5. Dependencies must be explicitly passed as tools if the agent needs them

## Code execution environment

CodeAct runs generated code in a **sandboxed Deno-based Python interpreter**, not your system's Python. This means:

- **Isolation** -- code cannot access your filesystem, network, or environment variables
- **No external imports** -- standard library only within generated code; no pip packages
- **Tool access** -- the agent calls your tool functions, which execute in your normal Python environment. Only the glue code between tool calls runs in the sandbox.
- **State persistence** -- variables persist across iterations within a single agent call, so the agent can build up results incrementally

The sandbox provides security boundaries, but your tool functions themselves run in your normal Python process. If a tool accesses a database or API, that access is real.

## Safety considerations

1. **Tool functions are the trust boundary.** The sandbox constrains the generated glue code, but tool functions execute with full privileges. Keep tool functions minimal and validate their inputs.

2. **Set `max_iters` appropriately.** A runaway agent burns tokens. Start with `max_iters=5` and increase only if you see the agent running out of steps on legitimate tasks.

3. **Validate outputs.** Use `dspy.Assert` or `dspy.Suggest` in a wrapper module to check that the agent's answer meets your requirements.

4. **Don't expose dangerous operations as tools.** If you pass a tool that deletes files or sends emails, the agent can and will call it. Only expose tools you're comfortable with the agent using autonomously.

```python
class SafeCodeAgent(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, tools):
        self.agent = dspy.CodeAct(
            "task -> result",
            tools=tools,
            max_iters=5,
        )

    def forward(self, task):
        result = self.agent(task=task)
        dspy.Assert(
            len(result.result.strip()) > 0,
            "Agent must produce a non-empty result",
        )
        return result
```

## Using CodeAct inside a custom module

Wrap CodeAct in a `dspy.Module` to add pre-processing, post-processing, or combine it with other DSPy modules:

```python
class AnalysisAgent(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.planner = dspy.ChainOfThought("task -> plan")
        self.executor = dspy.CodeAct(
            "task, plan -> result",
            tools=[compute_stats, format_table],
            max_iters=8,
        )
        self.summarize = dspy.ChainOfThought("task, result -> summary")

    def forward(self, task):
        plan = self.planner(task=task)
        execution = self.executor(task=task, plan=plan.plan)
        return self.summarize(task=task, result=execution.result)
```

## Optimizing CodeAct agents

CodeAct agents are optimizable like any DSPy module:

```python
def task_metric(example, prediction, trace=None):
    return prediction.answer.strip() == example.answer.strip()

# BootstrapFewShot works well -- the agent learns from successful code traces
optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(metric=task_metric, max_bootstrapped_demos=4)
optimized = optimizer.compile(agent, trainset=trainset)

# MIPROv2 can also tune the instructions for code generation
optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=task_metric, auto="medium")
optimized = optimizer.compile(agent, trainset=trainset)

# Save and load
optimized.save("optimized_codeact.json")
```

## When to use CodeAct vs ReAct

| Scenario | Use |
|---|---|
| Look up facts and combine them | ReAct |
| Calculate, aggregate, or transform data | **CodeAct** |
| Simple API calls (weather, stock price) | ReAct |
| Multi-step data processing pipeline | **CodeAct** |
| Tasks where approach varies per input | **CodeAct** |
| Quick prototype with many tools | ReAct |
| Math-heavy or logic-heavy problems | **CodeAct** |
| Tasks needing external libraries in tools | ReAct (more flexible tool format) |
