# gtasks-todo-manager

## Overview

This skill enables Claude Code agents to manage to-do items across multiple Google accounts through the Google Tasks API. It provides comprehensive task management including creating, updating, completing, and organizing tasks, as well as managing task lists and aggregating views across accounts.

The skill uses a BYOC (Bring Your Own Credentials) model where users provide their own Google Cloud OAuth credentials, ensuring security and privacy.

## CLI Location

The CLI is located in the `scripts` subdirectory of this skill's base directory. When this skill is loaded, you receive a "Base directory for this skill" path. The CLI path is:

```
{base_directory}/scripts/cli.js
```

**All CLI commands in this skill's documentation assume you are running them from the scripts directory or using the full path.**

## Before Any Operation

**IMPORTANT**: Before performing any operation with this skill, you MUST complete the following checks in order:

### 1. Verify Authentication

Always verify authentication first:

```bash
node scripts/cli.js auth validate
```

If this command fails, proceed to the **Setup** operation.

### 2. Check for Config Migrations

After authentication succeeds, check if the config needs migration:

```bash
cat ~/.config/gtasks-todo-manager/config.json | jq -r '.schemaVersion // "unversioned"'
```

**Current schema version**: `0.3.2`

If the result is `unversioned` or an older version, proceed to the **Migrations** operation before continuing with the requested operation.
