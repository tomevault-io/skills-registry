# Overview

This skill enables agents to delete or archive secrets in 1Password using the `op` CLI. It supports permanent deletion for items no longer needed and archiving for items that might need to be recovered later.

The skill assumes the `op` CLI is installed and the user is already authenticated.

# Supported Operations

| Operation | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| Delete Item | Permanently remove an item from 1Password |
| Archive Item | Move an item to Archive for potential recovery |

# Workflow

## Phase 1: Context Assessment

### Step 1: Understand the Request

Determine what the user wants to delete or archive:

1. **Identify the target item**:
   - Item name or ID
   - Vault location (if known or ambiguous)

2. **Identify the operation type**:
   - Permanent deletion (item removed completely)
   - Archive (item moved to Archive, recoverable)

3. **Assess the situation**:
   - Is the credential compromised? (permanent delete recommended)
   - Might the item be needed later? (archive recommended)
   - Is this a cleanup of test/duplicate items? (permanent delete)

4. **Clarify if needed**:
   - If item name is ambiguous, ask for vault or use item ID
   - If operation type is unclear, recommend archive as safer option

## Phase 2: Delete Execution

### Step 2: Confirm Deletion

Before executing a destructive operation, confirm with the user:

1. **For permanent deletion**:
   - Warn that this action cannot be undone
   - Confirm the correct item is targeted
   - Suggest archive as alternative if appropriate

2. **For archiving**:
   - Confirm the item will be moved to Archive
   - Explain that archived items can be restored via 1Password app

### Step 3: Execute Delete Command

Based on the context assessment, execute the appropriate `op` command.

See [op CLI Delete Command Reference](references/op-delete-commands.md) for complete command syntax.

**Permanent deletion**:
```bash
op item delete "<item-name>"
```

**Permanent deletion from specific vault**:
```bash
op item delete "<item-name>" --vault "<vault>"
```

**Archive item**:
```bash
op item delete "<item-name>" --archive
```

**Archive from specific vault**:
```bash
op item delete "<item-name>" --vault "<vault>" --archive
```

### Step 4: Handle Errors

Common errors and resolutions:

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `item not found` | Verify item name, try listing items in vault |
| `vault not found` | List available vaults with `op vault list` |
| `more than one item matches` | Use item ID instead of name, or specify vault with `--vault` |
| `permission denied` | Verify vault access permissions |
