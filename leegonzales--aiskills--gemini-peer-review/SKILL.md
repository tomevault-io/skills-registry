# Gemini Peer Review - AI Collaboration Skill

🖥️ **Claude Code Only** - Requires terminal access to execute Gemini CLI commands.

Enable Claude Code to leverage Google's Gemini CLI for collaborative AI reasoning, peer review, and multi-perspective analysis of code architecture, design decisions, and implementations.

## Core Philosophy

**Two AI perspectives are better than one for high-stakes decisions.**

This skill enables strategic collaboration between Claude Code (Anthropic) and Gemini (Google) for:
- Architecture validation and critique
- Design decision cross-validation
- Alternative approach generation
- Security, performance, and testing analysis
- Learning from different AI reasoning patterns

**Not a replacement—a second opinion.**

Gemini's massive 1M token context window allows it to process entire codebases without chunking, providing holistic analysis that complements Claude's detailed reasoning. Together, they offer comprehensive insights through different reasoning approaches.

---

## When to Use Gemini Peer Review

### High-Value Scenarios

**DO use when:**
- Making high-stakes architecture decisions
- Choosing between significant design alternatives
- Reviewing security-critical code
- Validating complex refactoring plans
- Exploring unfamiliar domains or patterns
- User explicitly requests second opinion
- Significant disagreement about approach
- Performance-critical optimization decisions
- Testing strategy validation
- Analyzing large codebases requiring massive context
- Multimodal analysis needed (diagrams, PDFs, designs)

**DON'T use when:**
- Simple, straightforward implementations
- Already confident in singular approach
- Time-sensitive quick fixes
- No significant trade-offs exist
- Low-impact tactical changes
- Gemini CLI is not available/installed

### How to Invoke This Skill

**Important:** This skill requires explicit invocation. It is not automatically triggered by natural language.

**To use this skill, Claude must explicitly invoke it using:**

```
skill: "gemini-peer-review"
```

**User phrases that indicate this skill would be valuable:**
- "Get a second opinion on..."
- "What would Gemini think about..."
- "Review this architecture with Gemini"
- "Use Gemini to validate this approach"
- "Are there better alternatives to..."
- "Get Gemini peer review for this"
- "Security review with Gemini needed"
- "Ask Gemini about this design"
- "Analyze the entire codebase with Gemini"
- "Review this architecture diagram with Gemini"

When these phrases appear, Claude should suggest using this skill and invoke it explicitly if appropriate.

---

### Codex vs Gemini: Which Peer Review Skill?

Both Codex and Gemini peer review skills provide valuable second opinions, but excel in different scenarios.

**Use Gemini Peer Review when:**
- Code size > 5k LOC (large codebase analysis)
- Need full codebase context (up to 1M tokens)
- Reviewing architecture across multiple modules
- Analyzing diagrams + code together (multimodal)
- Want research-grounded recommendations (current best practices)
- Cross-module security analysis (attack surface mapping)
- Systemic performance patterns
- Design consistency checking

**Use Codex Peer Review when:**
- Code size < 500 LOC (focused reviews)
- Need precise, line-level bug detection
- Want fast analysis with concise output
- Reviewing single modules or functions
- Need tactical implementation feedback
- Performance bottleneck identification (specific issues)
- Quick validation of design decisions

**For mid-range codebases (500-5k LOC):**
- Use **Gemini** if: Cross-module patterns, holistic view, diagram analysis, research grounding
- Use **Codex** if: Focused review, single module, speed priority, specific bugs
- Consider **Both** for: Critical decisions requiring maximum confidence

**For maximum value on high-stakes decisions:** Use both skills sequentially and apply synthesis framework (see references/synthesis-framework.md).

---

## Core Workflow

### 1. Recognize Need for Peer Review

**Assess if peer review adds value:**

Questions to consider:
- Is this a high-stakes decision with significant impact?
- Are there multiple valid approaches to consider?
- Is the architecture complex or unfamiliar?
- Does this involve security, performance, or scalability concerns?
- Has the user explicitly requested a second opinion?
- Would different AI reasoning perspectives help?
- Would Gemini's 1M token context window provide better holistic analysis?
- Are there multimodal elements (diagrams, designs, PDFs) to analyze?

**If yes to 2+ questions:** Proceed with peer review workflow

---

### 2. Prepare Context for Gemini

**Extract and structure relevant information:**

Load `references/context-preparation.md` for detailed guidance on:
- What code/files to include
- How to frame questions effectively
- Context boundaries (what to include/exclude)
- Expectation setting for output format
- Leveraging Gemini's massive context window

**Key preparation steps:**

1. **Identify core question:** What specifically do we want Gemini to review?
2. **Extract relevant code:** With 1M tokens, can include entire modules or services
3. **Provide context:** Project type, constraints, requirements, concerns
4. **Frame clearly:** Specific questions, not vague requests
5. **Set expectations:** What kind of response we need
6. **Include multimodal assets:** Architecture diagrams, UI designs, PDFs if relevant

**Context structure template:**
```
[CONTEXT]
Project: [type, purpose, stack]
Current situation: [what exists]
Constraints: [technical, business, time]
Scale considerations: [users, data volume, performance requirements]

[CODE/ARCHITECTURE]
[relevant code or architecture description - can be extensive due to 1M context]

[MULTIMODAL ASSETS]
[if applicable: architecture diagrams, design mockups, technical specs]

[QUESTION]
[specific question or review request]

[EXPECTED OUTPUT]
[format: analysis, alternatives, recommendations, etc.]
```

**Gemini-specific advantages:**
- **Large context:** Can include entire microservice or multiple related modules
- **Multimodal:** Can analyze architecture diagrams alongside code
- **Holistic view:** Sees inter-dependencies that might be missed with chunked context

---

### 3. Invoke Gemini CLI

**Execute appropriate CLI command:**

Load `references/gemini-commands.md` for complete reference.

**Common patterns:**

**Non-interactive review (recommended):**
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | gemini
[prepared context and question here]
EOF
```

**Multi-line prompt:**
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | gemini
[context for complex reasoning]
EOF
```

**With multimodal (image/diagram):**
```bash
gemini "Analyze this architecture diagram: [question]" @architecture.png
```

**Security-focused review:**
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | gemini
Security review focus:
[context and code]
EOF
```

**Key flags:**
- Positional prompt: `gemini "your prompt"` (non-interactive)
- Stdin pipe: `cat prompt.txt | gemini` (multi-line prompts)
- `--output-format`: Control output format (text/json/stream-json)
- `--yolo` / `-y`: Auto-approve all actions
- File references: Use `@file_path` or `@directory/` to include context

**Note:** The `-p`/`--prompt` flag is deprecated. Use positional prompts or stdin pipe instead.

**Common patterns:**

**Architecture review:**
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | gemini
Review this microservices architecture:

[Service definitions, API contracts, data flow]

Concerns: scalability, data consistency, deployment complexity
Question: Are the service boundaries appropriate? Any architectural risks?
EOF
```

**Security-focused review:**
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | gemini
Security review of authentication system:

[Auth code, session management, token handling]

Threat model: [attack vectors]
Question: Identify vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and hardening opportunities.
EOF
```

**Design decision with alternatives:**
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | gemini
Design decision: Event sourcing vs traditional CRUD

[Domain model, use cases, team context]

Alternatives:
A) Event sourcing with CQRS
B) Traditional CRUD with audit logs
C) Hybrid approach

Question: Analyze trade-offs for our context and recommend approach.
EOF
```

**Error handling:**
- If Gemini CLI not installed, inform user and provide installation instructions
- If API limits reached, note limitation and proceed with Claude-only analysis
- If response is unclear, reformulate question and retry once

---

- Verify security and performance

**During implementation:**
- Use peer review when stuck or uncertain
- Validate critical decisions in real-time
- Get alternative approaches when blocked

---

## Quality Signals

### Peer Review is Valuable When:

- Both perspectives identify same concerns (high confidence)
- Perspectives reveal complementary insights
- Trade-offs become clearer through different lenses
- Alternative approaches emerge that weren't initially visible
- Security or performance concerns are validated independently
- User gains clarity on decision through multi-perspective analysis
- Gemini's holistic view reveals patterns not apparent in isolated analysis
- Multimodal analysis (diagrams + code) provides visual-structural insights

### Peer Review Needs Refinement When:

- Responses are too vague or generic
- Question wasn't specific enough
- Context was insufficient
- Both perspectives say obvious things
- No new insights emerge
- Gemini response misunderstands the question

**Action:** Reformulate question with better context and specificity

### Skip Peer Review When:

- Gemini API unavailable and blocking progress
- Decision is time-sensitive and low-risk
- Approach is straightforward with no trade-offs
- User doesn't value second opinion for this decision
- API quota exhausted (though Gemini's free tier is generous)

---

## Best Practices

### Effective Peer Review

**DO:**
- Frame specific, answerable questions
- Provide sufficient context for informed analysis
- Use for high-stakes decisions where second opinion adds value
- Leverage Gemini's 1M token context for large codebase analysis
- Include architecture diagrams and design documents (multimodal)
- Be transparent about which AI provided which insight
- Acknowledge disagreements and explain them
- Synthesize perspectives rather than just concatenating them
- Give user enough context to make informed decision

**DON'T:**
- Use for every trivial decision
- Ask vague questions without context
- Force false consensus when perspectives diverge
- Hide which AI said what
- Ignore one perspective in favor of the other
- Present peer review as authoritative truth
- Over-rely on peer review for basic decisions
- Waste Gemini's large context window on tiny code snippets

### Context Preparation

**Effective context:**
- Focused on specific decision or area of code
- Includes relevant constraints and requirements
- Provides enough background without overwhelming
- Frames clear questions
- Sets expectations for output
- **For Gemini:** Leverages large context window by including entire modules/services
- **For Gemini:** Includes multimodal assets (diagrams, PDFs) when relevant

**Ineffective context:**
- Dumps code without question
- No clear question or focus
- Missing critical constraints
- Vague or overly broad
- No guidance on what kind of response is useful
- **For Gemini:** Artificially limits context when more would be helpful

### Question Framing

**Good questions:**
- "Review this microservices architecture. Are service boundaries well-defined? Any concerns with data consistency or deployment complexity? Here's the architecture diagram and all service code."
- "Compare these three caching strategies for our use case. Consider memory overhead, invalidation complexity, and cold-start performance. Our traffic pattern is [describe]."
- "Security review this authentication flow. Focus on session management, token expiration, and refresh token handling. Threat model: [describe]."
- "Analyze this entire backend codebase (40k LOC). Map the critical data flows and identify potential bottlenecks."

**Poor questions:**
- "Is this code good?" (too vague)
- "Review everything" (no focus despite large context capability)
- "What do you think?" (no specific goal)

---

EOF
```

**Synthesis:**
Combine security findings from both AIs, create prioritized remediation list.

---

### Example 3: Large Codebase Architecture Analysis

**User:** "Help me understand this unfamiliar 60k LOC codebase"

**Invoke peer review (leveraging 1M context):**
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | gemini
Analyze this complete backend codebase:

CODEBASE:
[Include entire codebase - Gemini's 1M token window can process 60k LOC!]

CONTEXT:
- E-commerce platform backend
- Microservices architecture
- New engineer onboarding perspective needed

QUESTIONS:
1. What are the major architectural patterns?
2. How does a typical request flow from API → Database?
3. What are the core abstractions/modules?
4. Where are the critical integration points?
5. What are potential scalability bottlenecks?
6. What technical debt is visible?

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- High-level architecture summary
- Request lifecycle walkthrough
- Module dependency map
- Critical code paths
- Scalability considerations
- Onboarding guide structure
EOF
```

**Gemini advantage on display:**
This is where Gemini truly shines—processing entire codebases in one context to see patterns, dependencies, and architectural decisions that would be impossible to detect with chunked analysis.

---

### Example 4: Multimodal Design-to-Implementation Review

**User:** "Does our implementation match the original architecture design?"

**Invoke peer review with diagram:**
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | gemini
Compare architecture design vs. implementation:

[Architecture diagram: @docs/architecture-v2.png]

DESIGN SPECIFICATION:
[See attached architecture diagram showing intended service structure]

IMPLEMENTATION:
[Include implementation code from src/services/*, src/api/*, infrastructure/*]

QUESTIONS:
1. Does implementation match intended architecture?
2. What deviations exist and why might they be problematic?
3. Are there missing components from the design?
4. Are there additional components not in the design?
5. Do the actual service boundaries align with designed boundaries?

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Match/deviation analysis
- Gap identification
- Risk assessment of deviations
- Recommendations for alignment
EOF
```

**Gemini advantage on display:**
Multimodal analysis—comparing visual architecture with actual code—is a unique Gemini capability that Claude cannot replicate alone.

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Don't:**
- Use peer review for every trivial decision (wastes time and quota)
- Blindly follow one AI's recommendation over the other
- Ask vague questions without context
- Expect perfect agreement between AIs
- Force implementation when both AIs raise concerns
- Use peer review as decision-avoidance mechanism
- Over-engineer simple problems by seeking too many opinions
- Underutilize Gemini's 1M context by sending tiny snippets
- Send sensitive/proprietary code without considering privacy implications

**Do:**
- Use strategically for high-stakes decisions
- Synthesize both perspectives thoughtfully
- Frame clear, specific questions with context
- Embrace disagreement as revealing trade-offs
- Use peer review to inform, not replace, judgment
- Make timely decisions based on integrated analysis
- Balance peer review with velocity
- Leverage Gemini's massive context window for large codebase analysis
- Use multimodal capabilities when visual assets are available
- Consider data privacy when sending code to external APIs

---

## Success Metrics

**Peer review succeeds when:**
- User gains clarity on decision through multi-perspective analysis
- Important trade-offs are revealed that weren't initially apparent
- Alternative approaches emerge that are genuinely valuable
- Risks are identified by at least one AI perspective
- User makes more informed decision than without peer review
- Confidence increases (when perspectives align)
- Trade-offs become explicit (when perspectives diverge)
- Large codebase patterns revealed through Gemini's holistic analysis
- Multimodal insights (diagram + code) provide unique value

**Peer review fails when:**
- No new insights emerge (obvious analysis)
- Takes too long relative to decision impact
- Perspectives are confusing rather than clarifying
- User is more confused after peer review than before
- Blocks forward progress unnecessarily
- Becomes crutch for simple decisions
- API quota exhausted without valuable insights
- Context sent was too small to leverage Gemini's strengths

## Appendix: Gemini vs. Claude Comparison

### When Gemini Excels

**Large Codebase Analysis:**
- 1M token context window vs. Claude's smaller windows
- Can process entire services/modules in single context
- Sees cross-module patterns that require holistic view

**Multimodal Analysis:**
- Process architecture diagrams alongside code
- Compare design mockups to implementation
- Analyze PDF specifications with code
- Visual-structural pattern matching

**Current Information:**
- Google Search grounding for latest best practices
- Current library versions and recommendations
- Recent security vulnerabilities and patches

**Alternative Perspective:**
- Different training data and reasoning approach
- May identify issues Claude's reasoning style misses
- Provides validation when perspectives align

### When Claude Excels

**Detailed Reasoning:**
- Step-by-step logical analysis
- Clear explanations of reasoning process
- Subtle logical flaw detection

**Native Integration:**
- Direct integration with Claude Code workflow
- No API calls or external dependencies
- Immediate response without latency

**Privacy:**
- Stays within Claude Code environment
- No code sent to external services
- Better for sensitive/proprietary code

### Optimal Collaboration Pattern

**Use both when:**
- High-stakes architectural decisions
- Security-critical code review
- Complex trade-off analysis
- Unfamiliar domains requiring multiple perspectives

**Use Gemini specifically for:**
- Entire codebase architecture analysis (leverage 1M context)
- Design-to-implementation validation (multimodal)
- Current best practice validation (Search grounding)

**Use Claude alone for:**
- Quick tactical decisions
- Detailed logical reasoning
- Sensitive code that can't be sent externally
- When Gemini API is unavailable
