Start a new feature. Gather a brief description, create the work unit, and route to the first phase.

> **⚠️ ZERO OUTPUT RULE**: Do not narrate your processing. Produce no output until a step or reference file explicitly specifies display content. No "proceeding with...", no discovery summaries, no routing decisions, no transition text. Your first output must be content explicitly called for by the instructions.

## Instructions

Follow these steps EXACTLY as written. Do not skip steps or combine them.

**CRITICAL**: This guidance is mandatory.

- After each user interaction, STOP and wait for their response before proceeding
- Never assume or anticipate user choices
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next

## Step 0: Initialisation

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Initialisation ───────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Running migrations to keep workflow files in sync.
```

Load **[casing-conventions.md](../workflow-shared/references/casing-conventions.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

**Run migrations — this is mandatory. You must complete it before proceeding.**

Invoke the `/workflow-migrate` skill and follow its instructions exactly — if it issues a STOP gate, you must stop.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
●───────────────────────────────────────────────●
  New Feature
●───────────────────────────────────────────────●

```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Starting a new feature. I'll ask what you're building, suggest
> a name, then you'll choose whether to research first or go straight
> to discussion.
```

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

---

## Step 1: Gather Feature Context

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Gather Feature Context ───────────────────────
```

#### If inbox file path was provided as positional argument (`$0`)

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Using context from your inbox item. Reading the inbox file
> to understand scope and suggest a name.
```

Read the inbox file at the provided path. Use its content as the feature description — skip the gather-context prompt. The slug from the filename (strip the `YYYY-MM-DD--` prefix, strip `.md`) becomes the suggested work unit name in Step 2.

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

#### Otherwise

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Gathering context for the feature. A brief description
> is enough to understand the scope and suggest a name.
```

Load **[gather-feature-context.md](references/gather-feature-context.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

---

## Step 2: Feature Name and Conflict Check

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Feature Name ─────────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Naming the feature and checking for conflicts. The name becomes
> the identifier used throughout the workflow.
```

Load **[name-check.md](references/name-check.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 3**.

---

## Step 3: Route to First Phase

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Choose Starting Phase ────────────────────────
```

Load **[research-gating.md](references/research-gating.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step 4**.

---

## Step 4: Invoke Entry-Point Skill

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Invoke Phase Skill ───────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Handing off to the selected phase. The next skill will load
> and guide you through the process.
```

Invoke the appropriate entry-point skill based on the selected phase:

| Phase | Invoke |
|-------|--------|
| research | `/workflow-research-entry feature {work_unit}` |
| discussion | `/workflow-discussion-entry feature {work_unit}` |

This skill ends. The invoked skill will load into context and provide additional instructions. Terminal.
