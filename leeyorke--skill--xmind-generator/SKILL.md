# XMind Generator Skill

This skill generates .xmind mind map files from standard XMind JSON format. The skill accepts structured JSON data that represents mind map content and converts it into a valid .xmind file.

## Overview

XMind files are ZIP archives containing XML files and resources. This skill handles the conversion from JSON to the proper XMind file structure.

## Input Format

The skill expects JSON input in the standard XMind JSON format. This typically includes:

- Root topic and structure
- Topics and subtopics hierarchy
- Relationships between topics
- Styling information
- Notes and labels

See [xmind-json-format.md](references/xmind-json-format.md) for detailed JSON schema documentation.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Provide the XMind JSON data as input to generate a .xmind file:

```json
{
  "rootTopic": {
    "title": "Main Topic",
    "children": [
      {
        "title": "Subtopic 1",
        "children": [...]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Advanced Features

- **Styling**: Include style properties for topics and relationships
- **Notes**: Add notes to topics
- **Markers**: Use markers for priority, flags, etc.
- **Relationships**: Define connections between topics

For advanced usage patterns, see [advanced-examples.md](references/advanced-examples.md).

## Output

The skill generates a .xmind file that can be opened in XMind or other mind mapping software that supports the XMind format.

## Scripts

Use the main conversion script:

```bash
scripts/xmind_converter.py <input.json> <output.xmind>
```

This script handles the complete conversion process from JSON to .xmind file format.
