# Initialize Project Skill

## When to use this Skill

Activate when the user:
- Mentions starting or creating a new project
- Uses keywords: "new project", "start project", "initialize project", "create project", "set up project"
- Wants to set up project management structure
- Needs to configure project documentation

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Identification

**Objective**: Understand what project we're setting up.

**Steps**:
1. **Extract project name** from user message if provided
2. **Determine target directory**:
   - If in a directory already, offer to initialize there
   - If project name given, create new directory
   - Otherwise, ask where to create the project
3. **Check for existing structure**:
   - Use `ls` to check if directory exists
   - Use `Read` to check for existing RULE.md
   - Warn if project already initialized

**Example**:
```
User: "I want to create a new project called Mobile App Redesign"

Detected:
- Project name: "mobile-app-redesign" (slugified)
- Action: Create new directory
```

### Phase 2: Interactive Q&A

**Objective**: Gather complete information about team workflow and preferences.

Use **AskUserQuestion** tool with clear, focused questions. Each question should offer specific options.

#### Question Set 1: Development Methodology

**Question**: "What development methodology does your team use?"

**Options to present**:
1. **Scrum** - Time-boxed sprints with ceremonies (planning, daily standup, review, retrospective)
2. **Kanban** - Continuous flow with WIP limits and visual board
3. **Waterfall** - Sequential phases with formal handoffs
4. **Agile (general)** - Iterative development without strict Scrum ceremonies
5. **Hybrid/Custom** - Combination of methodologies

**Follow-up questions based on choice**:

If **Scrum** selected:
- "How long are your sprints?" (1 week / 2 weeks / 3 weeks / 4 weeks)
- "Do you hold daily standups?" (Yes / No)
- "Sprint ceremonies to track?" (Planning, Review, Retrospective - multiSelect)

If **Kanban** selected:
- "What are your workflow stages?" (Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done - customizable)
- "Do you use WIP limits?" (Yes / No)
- "How often do you review the board?" (Daily / Weekly / Ad-hoc)

If **Waterfall** selected:
- "What are your project phases?" (Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment - customizable)
- "Do you need phase gate reviews?" (Yes / No)

If **Agile (general)** selected:
- "How long are your iterations?" (1 week / 2 weeks / 4 weeks / Continuous)
- "Do you have regular team meetings?" (Yes / No)

If **Hybrid/Custom** selected:
- Ask user to describe their process
- Extract key ceremonies and practices

#### Question Set 2: Team Structure

**Question**: "Tell me about your team structure"

**Information to gather**:
- Team size (Small: 2-5 / Medium: 6-10 / Large: 11+)
- Key roles present:
  - Product Owner / Product Manager
  - Scrum Master / Project Manager
  - Developers (how many?)
  - Designers
  - QA / Testers
  - Others
- Communication patterns:
  - Daily syncs
  - Weekly planning
  - Async-first
  - Real-time collaboration

**Use AskUserQuestion** with multiple questions if needed.

#### Question Set 3: Documentation Preferences

**Question**: "How does your team prefer to document work?"

**Options**:
1. **Structured with frontmatter** - YAML frontmatter with metadata, structured sections
2. **Simple markdown** - Plain markdown without strict formatting
3. **Table-based** - Information organized in markdown tables
4. **Issue-tracker style** - Similar to GitHub Issues / Jira format

**Follow-up**:
- "File naming convention preference?"
  - Date-prefixed: `2025-11-13_meeting-name.md`
  - Descriptive: `sprint-planning-sprint-5.md`
  - Numbered: `001-meeting-name.md`
  - Custom (ask user)

#### Question Set 4: Integration Requirements

**Question**: "What tools does your team integrate with?"

**Present as multiSelect options**:
- Version control: Git / GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket
- Issue tracking: GitHub Issues / Jira / Linear / Asana / Trello
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Jenkins / CircleCI
- Communication: Slack / Discord / Microsoft Teams
- Documentation: Notion / Confluence / Wiki
- None / Other

**For each selected integration**, gather specific details:
- Git: Repository URL, branch naming convention
- Issue tracker: Project key, link format
- CI/CD: Workflow names
- Communication: Webhook URLs, channel naming
- Documentation: Workspace URL, linking format

### Phase 3: Analysis & RULE.md Generation

**Objective**: Synthesize all Q&A responses into a comprehensive RULE.md.

**Steps**:

1. **Analyze responses**:
   - Identify primary methodology
   - Extract team size and structure
   - Determine documentation format
   - List integrations

2. **Generate directory structure** based on methodology:

   **For Scrum**:
   ```
   project-name/

   ├── docs/
   │   ├── README.md
   │   └── technical/
   ├── decisions/
   │   └── README.md
   └── milestones.yaml
   ```

   **For Waterfall**:
   ```

   ## Auto Workflows

   ### When Claude creates meeting notes:
   1. Extract all action items with @mentions
   2. Update README.md meeting index
   3. [If Scrum] Link to current sprint if relevant
   4. [If integrations enabled] Update external tracker
   5. Notify attendees of action items (if communication tool integrated)

   ### When Claude creates/updates [sprint|iteration|card|phase]:
   1. Update status in milestones.yaml if milestone-related
   2. Update README.md index
   3. [If version control] Suggest related branches
   4. [If issue tracker] Link to external issues
   5. Calculate velocity/progress metrics

   3. Archive related documentation
   4. Update project timeline
   5. [If communication tool] Announce completion

   ### When Claude searches project:
   1. Check README.md indexes first (fastest)
   2. Search by file patterns
   3. Full-text search as last resort
   4. Rank by relevance, recency, and location
   5. Show context (surrounding content)

   ## Integrations

   [For each integration from Q&A]

   ### [Integration Name]

   ## Notes

   - Created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   - Initialized by: ProjectMaster initialize-project Skill
   - Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   ```

4. **Generate milestones.yaml template**:

   ```yaml
   # Project Milestones
   # Managed by ProjectMaster track-milestone Skill

   project:
     name: [Project Name]
     start_date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
     target_completion: [YYYY-MM-DD or "TBD"]
     status: [planning|active|completed]

   milestones:
     # Example milestone structure:

     #     - Deliverable 2
     #   owner: "@name"
     #   notes: "Additional context"

   # Add milestones here as project progresses
   ```

### Phase 4: User Confirmation

**Objective**: Show the user what will be created and get approval.

**Steps**:

1. **Present summary** of configuration:
   ```
   📋 Project Configuration Summary

   Project: [name]
   Methodology: [methodology with key details]
   Team: [size] members ([roles])
   Documentation: [format preference]
   Integrations: [list]

   Directory structure:
   [Show tree structure]

   This will create:
   - RULE.md with your team's workflow
   - README.md project overview
   - [X] directories for [meetings/sprints/phases/etc]
   - milestones.yaml for tracking
   - Initial documentation templates

   Proceed with initialization?
   ```

2. **Wait for user confirmation**

3. **If user wants changes**:
   - Ask what to modify
   - Update configuration
   - Show summary again
   - Get confirmation

### Phase 5: Create Structure

**Objective**: Execute the initialization by creating all files and directories.

**Steps**:

1. **Create project directory** (if needed):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p [project-name]
   cd [project-name]
   ```

2. **Create all subdirectories**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p [dir1] [dir2] [dir3] ...
   ```
   Use the structure generated in Phase 3.

3. **Write RULE.md**:
   Use `Write` tool to create the RULE.md with generated content.

4. **Write milestones.yaml**:
   Use `Write` tool to create milestones.yaml template.

5. **Write project README.md**:
   ```markdown
   # [Project Name]

   > [Brief description]

   ## Project Information

   - **Status**: Planning
   - **Methodology**: [methodology]
   - **Team Size**: [number]
   - **Started**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   - **Target Completion**: TBD

   ## Quick Links

   - [RULE.md](RULE.md) - Project governance and workflows
   - [milestones.yaml](milestones.yaml) - Milestone tracking
   - [Meetings](meetings/) - Meeting notes
   - [[Sprints/Iterations/Phases]](path/) - [Work tracking]
   - [Documentation](docs/) - Technical documentation

   ## Contents

   [Will be auto-updated as content is added]

   ---

   Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   Governance maintained by: ProjectMaster
   ```

6. **Write README.md for each subdirectory**:
   Each major directory gets an index README.md:

   **meetings/README.md**:
   ```markdown
   # Meetings

   Meeting notes and minutes for [Project Name].

   ## Recent Meetings

   [Will be auto-updated]

   ## Meeting Types

   - [List types based on methodology]

   ---

   Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   ```

   **[sprints|board|phases]/README.md**:
   ```markdown
   # [Sprints/Board/Phases]

   [Work tracking] for [Project Name].

   ## [Current Sprint/Active Cards/Current Phase]

   [Will be updated as work progresses]

   ## [Backlog/Completed]

   [Will be updated]

   ---

   Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   ```

   **docs/README.md**:
   ```markdown
   # Documentation

   Technical documentation for [Project Name].

   ## Contents

   # Decisions

   Architecture and significant decisions for [Project Name].

   ## Decision Records

   [Will be auto-updated]

   ---

   Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   ```

7. **Create template files** (optional):
   If helpful, create example templates in a `templates/` directory:
   - meeting-template.md
   - sprint-template.md
   - decision-template.md

8. **Verify structure**:
   ```bash
   ls -R
   ```
   Confirm all directories and files created successfully.

### Phase 6: Report

**Objective**: Confirm successful initialization and guide next steps.

**Report format**:

```
✅ Project Initialized Successfully!

📁 Created structure for: [Project Name]
   Location: [path]

📄 Key files:
   ✓ RULE.md - Project governance
   ✓ README.md - Project overview
   ✓ milestones.yaml - Milestone tracking
   ✓ [X] directories created

⚙️ Configuration:
   - Methodology: [methodology details]
   - Team: [size] members
   - Documentation: [format]
   - Integrations: [list]

🚀 Next steps:
   [Provide 2-3 relevant suggestions based on methodology]

   Examples:
   - "Create your first sprint: 'Start sprint 1 for authentication features'"
   - "Add a milestone: 'Create milestone for beta release'"
   - "Record a meeting: 'Create meeting notes for kickoff'"
   - "Add team members to RULE.md"
   - "Define first set of user stories"

💡 Tips:
   - Your RULE.md defines how ProjectMaster works with this project
   - README.md files are auto-updated as you add content
   - All Skills respect your team's workflow from RULE.md
   - Use /project-status to see project health anytime

Ready to start building! What would you like to do first?
```

## Special Cases

### Case 1: Initializing in existing directory

If the target directory already contains files:

1. **Check for RULE.md**:
   - If exists: "This directory already has a RULE.md. Do you want to reinitialize (overwrites) or update the existing configuration?"
   - If doesn't exist: "This directory has files but no governance. Initialize ProjectMaster here?"

2. **Preserve existing structure**:
   - Don't delete existing files
   - Create missing directories only
   - Merge with existing structure if compatible

3. **Update README.md**:
   - If exists, append governance section
   - If doesn't exist, create new

### Case 2: Multiple projects in workspace

If user wants to initialize multiple projects:

1. **Create parent structure**:
   ```
   workspace/
   ├── project-1/
   │   └── RULE.md
   ├── project-2/
   │   └── RULE.md
   └── README.md (workspace index)
   ```

2. **Each project is independent**:
   - Separate RULE.md for each
   - Workspace README.md links to all projects

### Case 3: Minimal initialization

If user wants quick setup without Q&A:

1. **Use sensible defaults**:
   - Methodology: Agile (general)
   - Team: Small (unspecified roles)
   - Documentation: Structured with frontmatter
   - No integrations

2. **Create minimal structure**:
   ```
   project-name/
   ├── RULE.md (with defaults)
   ├── README.md
   ├── meetings/
   ├── work/
   ├── docs/
   └── milestones.yaml
   ```

3. **Inform user**:
   "Initialized with default configuration. Edit RULE.md to customize."

### Case 4: Template-based initialization

If user references an existing project as template:

1. **Read template RULE.md**
2. **Copy structure and configuration**
3. **Ask only for differences**:
   - Project name
   - Team members
   - Integration credentials
4. **Create with template configuration**

## Error Handling

### Error: Directory already exists

**Response**:
```
⚠️ Directory "[name]" already exists.

Options:
1. Initialize in existing directory (preserves files, adds governance)
2. Choose a different name
3. Cancel initialization

What would you like to do?
```

### Error: Invalid project name

**Response**:
```
⚠️ Project name "[name]" contains invalid characters.

Project names should:
- Use lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens
- No spaces or special characters
- Example: "mobile-app-redesign"

Please provide a valid project name.
```

### Error: Cannot write files

**Response**:
```
❌ Error: Unable to create files in [path]

Possible causes:
- Insufficient permissions
- Disk space full
- Path doesn't exist

Please check permissions and try again.
```

### Error: User cancels during Q&A

**Response**:
```
Initialization cancelled. No changes made.

You can restart initialization anytime by saying:
"Initialize a new project for [your project name]"
```

## Integration with AkashicRecords Governance

This Skill creates RULE.md files that are fully compatible with AkashicRecords:

1. **RULE.md format**: Uses natural language, readable by both systems
2. **README.md maintenance**: Both systems update README.md indexes
3. **Directory governance**: All ProjectMaster Skills respect RULE.md
4. **Workflow specifications**: Auto Workflows section defines behavior
5. **Cross-plugin compatibility**: AkashicRecords Skills can operate in ProjectMaster-initialized projects

**Example interaction**:
```
User: "Save this article about React best practices"

Claude: [AkashicRecords add-content Skill activates]
Reading RULE.md... This is a project directory.
Article is technical documentation.
Target: docs/technical/ (per RULE.md structure)
[Proceeds with adding article, updates README.md]
```

Both plugins share governance, ensuring consistency.

## Best Practices

### 1. Complete the Q&A thoroughly

Don't rush through questions. Accurate answers ensure the RULE.md matches your team's actual workflow.

### 2. Start simple, iterate

If unsure about configuration, use defaults and refine RULE.md later as the team's process becomes clearer.

### 3. Customize templates immediately

After initialization, review document templates in RULE.md and adjust to match your team's preferences.

### 4. Involve the team

Show the generated RULE.md to your team and gather feedback. Update before creating real content.

### 5. Document custom workflows

If your team has unique processes, add them to the "Auto Workflows" section in RULE.md immediately.

### 6. Test with a real item

After initialization, create one meeting note or sprint to verify the structure works as expected.

## Examples

### Example 1: Scrum Project

```
User: I want to start a new project for our e-commerce platform redesign

Claude: I'll help you set up a new project! Let me gather information about your team's workflow.

📋 Development Methodology
What development process does your team follow?

User: [Selects Scrum]

Claude: Great! A few details about your Scrum setup:
- Sprint length: 2 weeks
- Daily standups: Yes
- Ceremonies to track: All (planning, review, retrospective)

👥 Team Structure
- Team size: 6
- Roles: Product Owner (Alice), Scrum Master (Bob), 4 Developers

📝 Documentation
- Format: Structured with frontmatter
- Naming: Date-prefixed (2025-11-13_meeting-name.md)

🔗 Integrations
- Git (GitHub)
- Issue tracking (GitHub Issues)
- Communication (Slack)

[Shows summary, user confirms]

✅ Project Initialized Successfully!

📁 Created: ecommerce-redesign/
   ✓ RULE.md configured for 2-week Scrum sprints
   ✓ Directory structure with meetings/, sprints/, docs/
   ✓ milestones.yaml for tracking
   ✓ README.md with project overview

🚀 Next: "Create sprint 1 for user authentication"
```

### Example 2: Kanban Project

```
User: Set up a Kanban board for our bug fix project

Claude: I'll initialize a Kanban-based project! Let me ask a few questions...

[Q&A for Kanban workflow, team, etc.]

✅ Project Initialized: bug-fix-kanban/
   ✓ RULE.md configured for Kanban workflow
   ✓ board/ directory with backlog/, in-progress/, review/, done/
   ✓ WIP limits enabled in RULE.md
   ✓ Weekly board review meetings configured

🚀 Next: "Add a bug to the backlog"
```

### Example 3: Minimal Quick Setup

```
User: Quick project setup for prototyping, no fancy stuff

Claude: I'll create a minimal project with default settings.

✅ Project Initialized: prototype/
   ✓ RULE.md with Agile defaults
   ✓ Basic structure: meetings/, work/, docs/
   ✓ Simple markdown format

💡 You can customize RULE.md later as your needs evolve.

🚀 Ready to go! Add your first note or meeting.
```

## Notes

- This Skill only initializes the structure. Actual content is created by other Skills (track-meeting, manage-sprint, etc.).
- The generated RULE.md is a living document - teams should update it as their process evolves.
- All generated templates are customizable - edit RULE.md to change formats.
- Integration details can be added later if not known during initialization.
- The Skill creates a foundation; the team shapes it into their ideal workflow.

---
