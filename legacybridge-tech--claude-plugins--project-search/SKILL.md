# Project Search Skill

## When to use this Skill

Activate when the user:
- Asks to find or locate project content
- Uses keywords: "find", "search", "where is", "locate", "show me"
- Asks questions about project history or decisions
- Needs to find meetings, sprints, or documentation
- Wants to search by person, date, topic, or milestone
- References specific content they can't locate

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Query Analysis

**Objective**: Understand what the user is searching for and determine search strategy.

**Steps**:

1. **Parse search query** from user message:
   - Extract search terms
   - Identify search type (content, person, date, milestone, etc.)
   - Detect filters (date range, file type, status)

2. **Categorize search intent**:
   - **Content search**: "Find decisions about database"
   - **Person search**: "What has @alice worked on"
   - **Date search**: "Meetings from last week"
   - **Milestone search**: "What's in beta release milestone"
   - **Sprint search**: "Show sprint 5 stories"
   - **Topic search**: "Anything about authentication"
   - **Status search**: "Show blocked items"

3. **Extract search parameters**:
   - **Keywords**: Main search terms
   - **Person**: @mentions or names
   - **Date range**: "last week", "Q1", "after Jan 1", specific dates
   - **Content type**: meetings, sprints, docs, decisions, all
   - **Status**: completed, in-progress, blocked, planned
   - **Milestone/Sprint**: Specific milestone or sprint number

4. **Determine search scope**:
   - Project root only
   - Specific subdirectory (meetings/, sprints/, etc.)
   - Across entire workspace

**Example Analysis**:
```
User: "Find all meetings where we discussed the API design"

Parsed:
- Intent: Content search
- Keywords: ["API design"]
- Content type: meetings
- Date range: all time
- Search scope: meetings/

Strategy: README index → Content search in meetings/
```

### Phase 2: Strategy Selection

**Objective**: Choose optimal search strategy based on query type.

**Search strategies (in order of preference)**:

#### Strategy 1: README.md Index Search (Fastest)

**Use when**:
- Searching by file name, title, or general topic
- Need list of files in category
- Recent content (README indexes are up-to-date)

**Process**:
1. Read appropriate README.md file:
   - `meetings/README.md` for meeting search
   - `sprints/README.md` for sprint search
   - Project `README.md` for overview
2. Parse index entries
3. Filter by search criteria
4. Return matching entries with descriptions

**Example**:
```
Search: "Find sprint 5"
→ Read sprints/README.md
→ Find entry: "Sprint 5: Authentication Features"
→ Return: sprints/sprint-05/sprint-plan.md
```

#### Strategy 2: YAML/Structured Data Search (Fast)

**Use when**:
- Searching milestones (milestones.yaml)
- Searching by metadata (dates, owners, status)
- Need exact matches on structured fields

**Process**:
1. Read relevant YAML file (milestones.yaml)
2. Parse structure
3. Filter by criteria
4. Return matching entries

**Example**:
```
Search: "Show milestones owned by @alice"
→ Read milestones.yaml
→ Filter: owner == "@alice"
→ Return: List of alice's milestones
```

#### Strategy 3: Pattern Matching (Fast)

**Use when**:
- Searching by filename patterns
- Date-based filename search
- Type-based search (all *.md in sprints/)

**Process**:
1. Use `Glob` tool with pattern:
   - `meetings/**/*2025-11*.md` for November meetings
   - `sprints/*/sprint-plan.md` for all sprint plans
   - `docs/**/*.md` for all documentation
2. Filter results by additional criteria
3. Return matching files

**Example**:
```
Search: "Meetings from November"
→ Glob: meetings/**/*2025-11*.md
→ Return: List of November meeting files
```

#### Strategy 4: Full-Text Content Search (Slower)

**Use when**:
- Searching for specific terms in content
- Need to find mentions of topics, names, or concepts
- Other strategies insufficient

**Process**:
1. Use `Grep` tool with search terms
2. Specify scope (meetings/, sprints/, all project)
3. Extract context around matches
4. Rank results by relevance
5. Return matches with snippets

**Example**:
```
Search: "Find discussions about OAuth implementation"
→ Grep: pattern="OAuth" path=meetings/
→ Find matches in 3 meeting files
→ Return: Files with context snippets
```

#### Strategy 5: Cross-Reference Search (Comprehensive)

**Use when**:
- Need to find all related content
- Following links and references
- Building complete picture

**Process**:
1. Start with initial search (using above strategies)
2. Read found documents
3. Extract cross-references (links, mentions, related items)
4. Follow links recursively (limited depth)
5. Build relationship map
6. Return full result set with connections

**Example**:
```
Search: "Everything about beta release milestone"
→ Find milestone in milestones.yaml
→ Follow related_sprints links
→ Find meetings mentioning beta release
→ Find docs created for beta
→ Return: Complete set with relationships
```

### Phase 3: Execute Search

**Objective**: Run selected search strategy and gather results.

**Steps**:

1. **Execute primary search strategy**

2. **Collect results**:
   - File paths
   - Titles/descriptions
   - Relevant metadata (dates, owners, status)
   - Content snippets (for full-text search)

3. **Apply filters**:
   - Date range filter
   - Person filter (@mentions)
   - Status filter
   - Content type filter

4. **Check governance** (if applicable):
   - Read RULE.md for access restrictions
   - Filter out restricted content

5. **Rank results** by:
   - **Relevance**: Match quality to query
   - **Recency**: Newer content ranked higher
   - **Location**: Closer to project root ranked higher
   - **Completeness**: Fully completed items vs drafts

6. **If no results from primary strategy**:
   - Fall back to next strategy
   - Broaden search criteria
   - Suggest related searches

### Phase 4: Format and Present Results

**Objective**: Present search results in clear, actionable format.

**Steps**:

1. **Group results** by category:
   - Meetings
   - Sprints/Iterations
   - Milestones
   - Documentation
   - Decisions

2. **Format result entries**:
   ```
   📄 [Category] Title
      Path: path/to/file.md
      Date: YYYY-MM-DD
      [Relevant metadata: Owner, Status, etc.]
      [If content search: Context snippet with highlights]
   ```

3. **Include result count and search details**:
   ```
   🔍 Search Results for "{query}"

   Found {count} results in {categories}
   Search scope: {scope}
   Filters applied: {filters if any}
   ```

4. **Present results**:

Specific terms yield better results than generic ones.

### 3. Add filters to narrow results

Date ranges, content types, and person filters improve relevance.

### 4. Follow cross-references

Related content often provides fuller picture.

### 5. Search by person for team insights

Find what specific team members are working on or have created.

### 6. Use date-based search for retrospectives

"What did we do last sprint?" captures recent history.

### 7. Search by milestone for big picture

See all content contributing to major goals.

### 8. Combine search strategies

If one strategy fails, automatically try next.

## Notes

- Multi-strategy search ensures comprehensive results.
- README index search is fast and accurate for well-maintained projects.
- Full-text search is powerful but slower - use as fallback.
