# Terraform: importing existing resources

## When to use

Use this skill for importing existing resources in Terraform. This skill
specifically handles importing existing resources and nothing else in the
Terraform family.

## Procedure

Bring pre-existing un-managed resources under management with `import` blocks / `terraform import`, then generate matching config.

## Notes

This is the Terraform skill dedicated to importing existing resources.
Sibling skills cover other Terraform capabilities; this one
is the right choice only when the task is about importing existing resources.
