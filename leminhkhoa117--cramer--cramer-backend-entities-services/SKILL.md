# Cramer Backend Entities and Services

## Purpose

Align backend changes with documented entities, services, and API behavior.

## Workflow

1. Read docs first:
   - `docs/library/backend/ENTITIES.md`
   - `docs/library/backend/SERVICES.md`
   - `docs/library/backend/API_REFERENCE.md`
2. Locate relevant code in `backend/src/main/java/com/cramer/`:
   - `controller/`, `service/`, `repository/`, `entity/`, `dto/`, `mapper/`
3. Propose changes with a clear rationale.
4. Edit code and update docs where needed.
5. Summarize updates and any follow-up tasks.

## Guardrails

- Keep docs consistent with implementation.
- Avoid speculative changes without a concrete user request.
