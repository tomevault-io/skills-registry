- Specify appropriate model (haiku for simple, sonnet for complex, opus for critical)
- Include self-verification checklists

---

### Hooks
**Purpose:** Automated responses to Claude Code events.

**Structure:**
```
hooks/
├── hooks.json    # Hook definitions
└── scripts/      # Hook handler scripts
    └── handler.ts
```

**hooks.json Template:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/script.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Fields:**
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `matcher` | string | Tool filter: `"Write"`, `"Write\|Edit"`, `"Bash(npm test*)"`, or omit for all |
| `type` | string | `"command"` (shell) or `"prompt"` (Claude evaluation) |
| `command` | string | Shell command (for type="command") |
| `timeout` | number | Seconds before timeout (default: 60, optional) |

**Events:**
- `PreToolUse` - Before a tool executes
- `PostToolUse` - After a tool executes
- `PermissionRequest` - When permission is requested
- `UserPromptSubmit` - When user submits a prompt
- `SessionStart` - Session initialization
- `SessionEnd` - Session teardown
- `Stop` - When main agent finishes
- `SubagentStart` - When subagent starts
- `SubagentStop` - When subagent finishes
- `TeammateIdle` - Agent Teams: teammate waiting for work
- `TaskCompleted` - Agent Teams: task finished
- `PreCompact` - Before context compaction

## Quality Checklist

### Before Creating Any Element

- [ ] Fetched latest documentation from official sources
- [ ] Identified correct element type for the use case
- [ ] Checked for existing similar elements (avoid duplication)
- [ ] Determined relationships with existing elements

### Element Quality Standards

- [ ] YAML frontmatter is correct and complete
- [ ] Description is concise and actionable
- [ ] Structure follows established patterns in this package
- [ ] Markdown is clean and well-organized
- [ ] Examples are included where helpful
- [ ] Related elements are cross-referenced

### Consistency Checks

- [ ] Heading hierarchy is consistent (# for title, ## for sections)
- [ ] Language is English (except user-facing German content)
- [ ] No orphaned references to non-existent elements

---

## Optimization Workflow

When optimizing existing elements:

### 1. Analysis Phase
```
1. Read the element completely
2. Identify the element type and purpose
3. Fetch current best practices from documentation
4. Compare against other elements in the same category
5. List specific issues and improvements
```

### 2. Proposal Phase
```
1. Present findings to the user
2. Propose specific changes with rationale
3. Highlight any breaking changes or dependencies
4. Get approval before implementation
```

### 3. Implementation Phase
```
1. Make changes incrementally
2. Maintain backwards compatibility where possible
3. Update cross-references in related elements
4. Verify no broken references
```

### 4. Verification Phase
```
1. Validate YAML frontmatter syntax
2. Check markdown rendering
3. Verify all cross-references work
4. Test any commands or workflows
```

## Common Patterns in This Package

### Skill Organization
- Main SKILL.md with overview and triggers
- Separate files for detailed topics (reference.md, examples.md)
- Clear "When to Use" sections with bullet points

### Command Organization
- Grouped by category in subdirectories
- Step-by-step workflows with clear phases
- German output for user-facing commands where appropriate

### Agent Organization
- Detailed execution protocols with phases
- Self-verification checklists
- Comprehensive output format specifications

---

## Content Standards

### No History References
- **Never use** "new", "updated", "changed from", or version-specific markers
- **Never include** "since v2.1", "added in version X", "previously"
- **Write timelessly** as if features always existed
- **Remove** any existing history references when optimizing

### Token Efficiency
- Keep content concise but complete
- Avoid redundant explanations
- Use tables and lists over prose where appropriate
- Don't sacrifice clarity for brevity
- **Never remove important information for token savings**

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Overlapping Skills**: Two skills that trigger on the same conditions
2. **Monolithic Commands**: Commands that try to do too much
3. **Vague Descriptions**: Descriptions that don't help auto-detection
4. **Missing Cross-References**: Elements that should reference each other but don't
5. **Inconsistent Structure**: Elements that don't follow established patterns
6. **Outdated Best Practices**: Not checking current documentation before changes
7. **History References**: Adding "new", "updated", version markers to content
