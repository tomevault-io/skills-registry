# Flight Briefing Skill

Create professional pre-departure briefings from SimBrief flight plans, VATSIM
ATIS data, and NOTAMs. The briefing follows a structured 10-section format that
mirrors real airline operations briefing flow.

> **Before writing any briefing**, read `references/briefing-template.md` for the
> full section-by-section format and example content. That file is the authoritative
> guide for structure and tone.

## Workflow

Every briefing follows this sequence. Do not skip steps 1–3.

### Step 1 — Retrieve the Flight Plan

Call **`getLatestFlightPlan`** (Simbrief Flight Plans MCP). This is the default
and preferred tool — it returns comprehensive
markdown (~50–80 KB) with everything needed for a full briefing:

- Route, aircraft, flight time, distance
- Fuel breakdown and weight & balance
- Takeoff performance: V1, VR, V2, VREF for all runways, flex temps, max weights,
  distances (decision/reject/continue), wind components, flap settings
- Landing performance: distances (dry/wet), VREF, max landing weights per runway
- Weather: METAR, TAF, SIGMETs for departure, arrival, and alternate
- Critical NOTAMs (top 5 per airport, auto-filtered)
- NAT tracks (oceanic crossings)
- ETOPS data (if applicable)
- Performance impact analysis (CI, altitude, weight variations)
- ATC flight plan text
- Navigation waypoints with altitude, wind, fuel

If the user provides a specific plan ID, use `getFlightPlanById` instead.

Only use `getDispatchBriefing` or `getLatestFlightPlanSummary` if the user
explicitly asks for a "quick brief" or "summary" — these omit critical detail.

### Step 2 — Check VATSIM ATIS

Extract the departure, arrival, and alternate ICAO codes from the flight plan,
then call **`getVatsimAtis`** with all of them in a single request:

```
getVatsimAtis(["KJFK", "EGLL", "KBOS"])
```

- If controllers are online, include the ATIS code, frequency, runway in use,
  and relevant remarks in the appropriate briefing sections.
- If no ATIS is active, note "No active VATSIM controllers at this time" in each
  relevant section. This is normal and expected.

### Step 3 — Review NOTAMs (if needed)

The main flight plan already includes the top 5 critical NOTAMs per airport. Use
the **`getNotams`** tool only when:

- The user specifically asks about NOTAMs
- You need complete NOTAM details beyond the critical ones
- A critical NOTAM raises questions that need more context
- The user wants to review all NOTAMs for a specific airport

Parameters: `airport` ("origin", "destination", "alternate",
or "all").

### Step 4 — Check Weather (supplemental)

The flight plan includes METAR/TAF, but you can use **`getAviationWeather`** to
pull fresh METARs if the plan data seems stale or the user asks for a live
weather update. Set `includeTaf: true` for forecast data.

### Step 5 — Identify Gate/Terminal

If the user provides a gate, use it. Otherwise:
- Try a quick web search for the airline's typical terminal/gates at the
  departure and arrival airports
- If nothing is found, note it as TBD and move on — don't block the briefing

### Step 6 — Assemble the Briefing

Follow the 10-section structure defined in `references/briefing-template.md`.
Every section draws from specific data in the flight plan output. The reference
file maps each section to its data source.

## Tool Selection Quick Reference

| Need | Tool | When |
|------|------|------|
| Full flight plan (DEFAULT) | `getLatestFlightPlan` | Always use first |
| Specific plan by ID | `getFlightPlanById` | User provides plan ID |
| Quick summary only | `getDispatchBriefing` | User asks for "quick brief" |
| VATSIM controller info | `getVatsimAtis` | Always — after getting flight plan |
| Complete NOTAMs | `getNotams` | User asks, or critical NOTAMs need context |
| Fresh METAR/TAF | `getAviationWeather` | Supplemental weather check |
| Gate/terminal lookup | Web search | When gate not provided |

## Tone and Style

- **Professional but conversational** — like a dispatcher briefing a crew
- **Safety-focused** — flag anything non-standard prominently
- Use aviation terminology naturally (don't over-explain standard terms)
- Use markdown formatting: headers, tables for performance data, bold for
  critical values
- Sparingly use emojis for visual breaks (✈️ 🌤️ ⚠️ — not every line)
- End with a brief encouraging sign-off
- When presenting V-speeds and performance data, use tables for clarity
- Highlight any discrepancies between ATIS and flight plan (e.g., different
  active runway than planned)

## Safety Focus Areas

Flag these prominently whenever they appear:

- **Runway closures or restrictions** from NOTAMs
- **Weather below minimums** or deteriorating conditions
- **Performance limits** — runways where weight is restricted
- **Navigation equipment outages** affecting planned procedures
- **ETOPS concerns** — fuel, adequate airports, weather at diversion points
- **SIGMET activity** along the route
- **Discrepancies** — ATIS runway vs planned runway, wind shifts, etc.
- **Contaminated runways** — wet/snow/ice conditions affecting distances

## What NOT to Do

- Don't fabricate V-speeds, distances, or performance data — it's all in the
  flight plan output. Extract and present it.
- Don't skip calling `getVatsimAtis` — even if you expect no controllers online,
  always check.
- Don't dump raw METAR strings without interpretation — decode winds, visibility,
  ceiling, and weather phenomena into plain language alongside the raw data.
- Don't overwhelm with every NOTAM — the critical ones are pre-filtered. Use
  `getNotams` only when the user needs the full picture.
- Don't make up gate assignments — search or note as TBD.

## Handling Edge Cases

**Oceanic flights**: Include NAT track information, SELCAL codes, oceanic
communication procedures, and ETOPS data. These are all in the flight plan.

**Short-haul / domestic**: Skip oceanic and ETOPS sections. Focus on departure
performance, weather, and arrival.

**Missing data**: If any section of the flight plan is empty or unavailable, note
it clearly and move on. Never fabricate data to fill gaps.

**Multiple alternates**: Brief all alternates listed in the flight plan with
weather and approach capabilities.

**User asks follow-up questions**: You already have the flight plan data in
context. Answer directly without re-fetching unless they ask for a refresh.
