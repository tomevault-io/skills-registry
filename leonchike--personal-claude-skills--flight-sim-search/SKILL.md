# Flight Sim Search Skill

Guide Claude to use the Flight Sim Search MCP server effectively — searching flights,
formatting results, constructing URLs, and managing MSFS 2024 addons.

## When to Use This Skill

### ✅ TRIGGER — Flight simulation discovery

The user wants to find real-world flights to fly in a simulator. Signals include:

- **Aircraft type codes**: "A359", "A35K", "B77W", "B789", "777-200ER", "Dreamliner"
- **Large result sets**: "find me 200 flights", "show me at least 150 options"
- **Duration + aircraft combos**: "8hr flights on the A350", "12-hour 777 routes"
- **Airline operations**: "what does Turkish fly on the A350", "Emirates A380 routes"
- **Sim-specific language**: "SimBrief", "dispatch", "MSFS", "flight sim", "addon"
- **Route exploration**: "long-haul from EDDF", "trans-Pacific routes", "flights between KJFK and EGLL"
- **Casual sim discovery**: "find me a cool long-haul", "interesting overnight flights"
- **ICAO airport codes used naturally**: "routes out of KATL", "flights into RJTT"
- **Addon management**: "what airports do I have installed", "add PMDG 777 to my addons"

### ❌ DO NOT TRIGGER — Real-world travel planning

The user wants to book or plan personal travel. Signals include:

- **Destination + date**: "flights to Amsterdam in early June", "fly to Tokyo next week"
- **Price/booking language**: "cheapest flight to London", "book me a ticket"
- **Personal travel context**: "I'm planning a trip to...", "vacation flights to..."
- **Seat/class preferences**: "business class to Dubai", "direct flights under $500"
- **No aircraft type or sim context**: just destinations and dates without sim indicators

If in doubt, look for aircraft type codes or sim terminology — their presence almost always
means flight sim discovery.

## Core Principles

1. **Maximize options** — When a user asks for flights, default to providing many results
   (50–60 in compact mode) unless they ask for fewer. Offer related alternatives (similar
   routes, alternate aircraft, nearby durations).

2. **Smart response sizing** — Match the response mode to the result count:

   | Results   | Mode                      | Key settings                          |
   |-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
   | 1–50      | Standard + URLs           | `includeUrls: true`                   |
   | 50–100    | Standard, no URLs         | defaults                              |
   | 100–200   | Standard, no URLs         | `compact: false`                      |
   | 200+      | **Compact**               | `compact: true` (URLs unavailable)    |

3. **URLs are OFF by default** — Only include them when the user explicitly asks for links
   or the result set is small (< 50). Prefer SimBrief and FR24 links when included.

4. **Categorize for clarity** — Group results by airline, route/region, aircraft type,
   duration range, or time of day when it improves readability.

## Search Tool Quick Reference

### `searchFlights` — Primary tool

| Parameter            | Type             | Notes                                        |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `airline`            | string           | ICAO 3-letter code (e.g. `"DLH"`)           |
| `originIcao`         | string           | Departure ICAO (e.g. `"EDDF"`)              |
| `destinationIcao`    | string           | Arrival ICAO (e.g. `"KJFK"`)                |
| `aircraftType`       | string           | ICAO code or common name (`"A359"`, `"787"`) |
| `minDurationMinutes` | number           | Lower bound in minutes                       |
| `maxDurationMinutes` | number           | Upper bound in minutes                       |
| `durationMinutes`    | number           | Approximate target (±30 min)                 |
| `limit`              | number           | Max results (default 50)                     |
| `compact`            | boolean          | Shortened fields, ~82% smaller               |
| `includeUrls`        | boolean or array | `true`, `false`, or `["simbrief","fr24"]`    |

### Supporting tools

- **`getFlightByIdentifier`** — Look up a specific flight (e.g. `"LH765"`).
- **`getFlightByDatabaseId`** — Look up by database ID.
- **`listAircraftTypes`** — List all aircraft in the database.
- **`queryDatabase`** — Run read-only SQL for complex queries.

### MSFS 2024 Addon tools

- **`listMSFSAddons`** — Browse/filter addons (type, developer, installed status, etc.).
- **`createMSFSAddon`** / **`updateMSFSAddon`** / **`deleteMSFSAddon`** / **`getMSFSAddon`** — CRUD for addon entries.

### SimBrief & Weather tools

- **`getLatestFlightPlan`** / **`getDispatchBriefing`** — Retrieve SimBrief flight plans.
- **`getNotams`** — NOTAMs for flight plan airports.
- **`getAviationWeather`** — Current METAR observations.
- **`getVatsimAtis`** — VATSIM ATIS information.

## Search Strategy

### Single aircraft type, single duration
Straightforward — one `searchFlights` call:
```
searchFlights(aircraftType: "A359", durationMinutes: 480, limit: 200, compact: true)
```

### Multiple aircraft types (e.g. "A359 or A35K")
Run **separate searches per aircraft type** and combine results:
```
searchFlights(aircraftType: "A359", durationMinutes: 480, limit: 200, compact: true)
searchFlights(aircraftType: "A35K", durationMinutes: 480, limit: 200, compact: true)
```
Present results grouped by aircraft type with clear section headers.

### Open-ended exploration ("find me a cool long-haul")
Use broader parameters and curate the results:
- Search with just `minDurationMinutes: 480` and a high limit
- Group results by airline or region for browsability
- Highlight unique or scenic routes

## Presenting Results

Use markdown tables. The standard columns are:

```
| Flight | Aircraft | Route (ICAO) | Duration | Departure (Local) | Arrival (Local) |
```

Add a `| Links |` column only when URLs are included.

**Formatting details:**
- Duration as `HH:MM` (e.g. `09:30`)
- Times with timezone abbreviation (e.g. `03:27 AM IST`)
- Route as `ORIG → DEST`
- Group by airline/category with `###` headers and `---` separators
- Include flight count in each section header

### Multi-airline queries

Group each airline under its own header:
```
### Lufthansa (DLH) — 25 Flights
| ... |
---
### Turkish Airlines (THY) — 22 Flights
| ... |
```

### Duration-based queries

Consider grouping by range (short-haul < 3 h, medium 3–6 h, long 6–9 h, ultra 9+ h).

## Duration Conversion

Always convert user-friendly hours to minutes for the API:
- "around 9 hours" → `durationMinutes: 540`
- "9–9.5 hours" → `minDurationMinutes: 540, maxDurationMinutes: 570`
- "under 3 hours" → `maxDurationMinutes: 180`
- "over 12 hours" → `minDurationMinutes: 720`
- "8hr flights" → `durationMinutes: 480`
- "at least 6 hours" → `minDurationMinutes: 360`

## Common Airline ICAO Codes

Lufthansa: DLH · Turkish: THY · Singapore: SIA · Delta: DAL · Iberia: IBE ·
Ethiopian: ETH · China Airlines: CAL · Cathay Pacific: CPA · American: AAL ·
United: UAL · British Airways: BAW · Emirates: UAE · Qatar: QTR · Air France: AFR ·
KLM: KLM

## URL Construction

See `references/url-construction.md` for full templates and field mappings.

**Quick reference:**

| Service       | Template                                                                                       |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SimBrief      | `https://dispatch.simbrief.com/options/custom?airline={AIRLINE}&fltnum={FLIGHTNUMBER}&type={AIRCRAFTTYPE}&orig={ORIGIN}&dest={DESTINATION}` |
| FlightRadar24 | `https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/{iata_lowercase}{FLIGHTNUMBER}`                   |
| FlightAware   | `https://flightaware.com/live/flight/{AIRLINE}{FLIGHTNUMBER}`                                 |

When URLs weren't fetched from the server (compact mode or large results), construct them
manually from the flight data fields you already have.

## Compact Mode Field Mapping

Standard → Compact: `flightnumber` → `flt`, `aircrafttype` → `acft`,
`departureicaocode` → `orig`, `arrivalicaocode` → `dest`, `flightdurationmins` → `durMins`,
`departuretimelocal` → `depLocal`, `arrivaltimelocal` → `arrLocal`.

## Helpful Follow-ups

End responses with a relevant suggestion:
- "Would you like SimBrief dispatch links for any of these?"
- "Want to explore different aircraft on this route?"
- "Should I narrow these down by time of day or specific airports?"

## Error Handling

If a search returns few or no results:
1. Suggest broadening criteria (wider duration, remove aircraft filter).
2. Verify ICAO codes are correct.
3. Offer to search similar routes or airlines.
4. Use `listAircraftTypes` to confirm aircraft availability.

## Advanced: Custom SQL

For complex queries the standard search can't handle, use `queryDatabase`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM flightawareflightdata
WHERE airline = 'DLH'
  AND aircrafttype = 'A359'
  AND flightdurationmins BETWEEN 540 AND 570
ORDER BY departuretimelocal
LIMIT 30;
```
