# VATSIM ATIS Skill

Retrieve and present VATSIM ATIS and aviation weather in a quick, scannable
format suitable for mid-flight or pre-flight use.

## Workflow

### 1 — Identify Airports

Extract ICAO codes from the user's request. Accept:
- Explicit ICAO codes: "KJFK", "EGLL"
- Airport names: "Heathrow" → EGLL, "JFK" → KJFK, "O'Hare" → KORD
- Context references: "my departure and arrival" → pull from active flight plan
- Multiple airports in one request: "KJFK and EGLL"

If the user says something like "check ATIS for my flight" or references a
flight plan, call `getLatestFlightPlanSummary` first to extract the departure,
arrival, and alternate ICAO codes — then proceed.

### 2 — Fetch Data

Make **both** calls in the same turn for the fastest response:

- **`getVatsimAtis`** with all ICAO codes (up to 20)
- **`getAviationWeather`** with the same ICAO codes, set `includeTaf: true`

### 3 — Present Results

For **each airport**, present a compact block:

```
## KJFK — John F. Kennedy Intl

**VATSIM ATIS** (Info Alpha · 128.725)
Runway 31L in use · ILS approaches · Wind 320/12
Controller: JFK_ATIS (online since 14:32Z)

**METAR** (VFR ✅)
Wind 320° at 12 kt · Visibility 10+ sm · Few clouds at 4,500 ft
Temp 8°C / Dewpoint 2°C · Altimeter 30.12 inHg
`KJFK 171456Z 32012KT 10SM FEW045 08/02 A3012`

**TAF Summary**
Next 6 hrs: Winds shifting 350/15, visibility remaining good.
After 22Z: Ceiling lowering to BKN025, possible light rain.
```

### No VATSIM Controller Online

When no ATIS is available (common — this is normal):

```
## KJFK — John F. Kennedy Intl

**VATSIM ATIS**: No active controllers at this time.

**METAR** (VFR ✅)
Wind 320° at 12 kt · Visibility 10+ sm · Few clouds at 4,500 ft
Temp 8°C / Dewpoint 2°C · Altimeter 30.12 inHg
`KJFK 171456Z 32012KT 10SM FEW045 08/02 A3012`
```

Still present the real-world METAR/TAF — that's always useful even without VATSIM
controllers.

## METAR Decoding

Always decode the METAR into plain language. Key fields:

- **Wind**: Direction, speed, gusts (flag gusts > 25 kt or crosswind concerns)
- **Visibility**: In statute miles or meters
- **Ceiling/Clouds**: Layer types and altitudes (flag < 1000 ft AGL)
- **Weather phenomena**: Rain, snow, fog, thunderstorms — spell them out
- **Temp/Dewpoint**: Flag when spread < 3°C (fog risk)
- **Altimeter**: inHg or QNH as appropriate for region
- **Flight category**: VFR ✅ / MVFR 🟡 / IFR 🟠 / LIFR 🔴

Include the raw METAR string in a code-formatted line below the decoded version.

## TAF Presentation

Summarize the TAF in plain language focused on the next 6–12 hours:
- Significant changes (wind shifts, ceiling drops, visibility reduction)
- Tempo/probability groups that affect operations
- When conditions are expected to improve or deteriorate

Don't dump the raw TAF unless the user asks for it.

## Response Style

- **Concise** — the user may be mid-flight; get to the point
- **Scannable** — use the block format above, bold key labels
- **Flag concerns** with ⚠️: low ceilings, strong crosswinds, gusts, low vis,
  significant weather, rapidly deteriorating conditions
- When multiple airports are requested, present them in the order: departure →
  arrival → alternate (or the order the user asked)
- Don't add lengthy intros or outros — just the data

## Multiple Airport Efficiency

Both `getVatsimAtis` and `getAviationWeather` accept arrays of ICAO codes.
Always batch them into single calls rather than making separate calls per airport.

## Follow-Up Suggestions

Keep these brief — one line at most:
- "Want me to check NOTAMs for any of these?"
- "Need a full briefing for this flight?"
- "Want me to refresh these in a few minutes?"
