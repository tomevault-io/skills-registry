# Delivery Reporting Skill

Creating visual executive presentations that showcase squad deliveries and business value.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Quality Over Speed

**This skill prioritizes depth over velocity.**

| Principle | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Analysis Approach** | Deep code analysis with specialized agents |
| **Time Expectation** | 40-80 minutes for 8 repositories (5-10 min each) |
| **Quality Standard** | Accurate business value from actual code, not titles |
| **Agent Strategy** | Specialized agents (backend-engineer-golang, etc.) per repo type |

**FORBIDDEN:**
- ❌ Using `general-purpose` agent for parallel speed
- ❌ Rushing analysis to meet arbitrary deadlines
- ❌ Reading only PR titles without code analysis
- ❌ Skipping Gate 2.5 (Deep Code Analysis)

**REQUIRED:**
- ✅ Sequential deep analysis per repository
- ✅ Code reading with domain-specialized agents
- ✅ Real data, never estimates
- ✅ Business value extracted from actual code changes

---

## Purpose

This skill provides a framework for:
- Squad delivery reports (engineering + product + design)
- Visual HTML slide presentations
- **Deep code analysis** using specialized agents
- Business value extraction from Git repositories
- Quarterly/monthly showcase of releases and features
- Stakeholder-facing delivery summaries

**Key Difference from `executive-reporting`:**
- **executive-reporting**: Portfolio/project status (PMO focus, RAG/SPI/CPI metrics)
- **delivery-reporting**: Squad deliveries (technical focus, deep code analysis, releases/PRs/features)

---

## Visual Identity Options

MUST ask user for visual identity preference when generating delivery reports:

### Option 1: Lerian Studio (Default)

```yaml
visual_identity:
  background: "#0C0C0C"  # Black
  text_primary: "#FFFFFF"  # White
  text_secondary: "#CCCCCC"  # Light gray
  accent: "#FEED02"  # Lerian Yellow
  font_family: "Poppins, system-ui, sans-serif"
```

### Option 2: Ring Neutral (Corporate)

```yaml
visual_identity:
  background: "#F5F5F5"  # Very light gray
  text_primary: "#1A1A1A"  # Soft black
  text_secondary: "#666666"  # Medium gray
  accent: "#0066CC"  # Professional blue
  font_family: "system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif"
```

### Option 3: Custom (User-Provided)

User provides their own color scheme and fonts.

**MANDATORY:** Always ask which option before proceeding with report generation.

---

## Delivery Reporting Gates

### Gate 1: Input Collection

**Objective:** Gather required information for report generation

**Actions:**
1. Collect period (start date, end date)
2. Collect repository list
3. Collect business context (optional)
4. Select visual identity (Lerian/Ring/Custom)

**User Input Format:**
```markdown
**Período de Análise:**
- Data de Início: AAAA-MM-DD
- Data de Fim: AAAA-MM-DD

**Repositórios para Análise:**
- org/repo-name-1 (e.g., LerianStudio/midaz)
- org/repo-name-2 (e.g., LerianStudio/product-console)
- OR full URLs: https://github.com/org/repo

**Contexto de Negócio (Opcional):**
- [Text with project names, clients, strategic context]

**Identidade Visual:**
- [lerian/ring/custom]
```

**Repository Format Rules:**

| Format | Example | Valid? |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **org/repo** (recommended) | `LerianStudio/midaz` | ✅ |
| **Full URL** (alternative) | `https://github.com/LerianStudio/midaz` | ✅ |
| Name only | `midaz` | ❌ Missing org |
| Too many slashes | `org/repo/subdir` | ❌ Invalid format |

**CRITICAL:** Agent MUST validate repository format and provide clear error if invalid.

**Output:** `docs/pmo/delivery-reports/{date}/inputs.md`

---

### Gate 2: Repository Analysis

**Objective:** Extract technical data from Git repositories

**Actions for Each Repository:**
1. **Tags/Releases:** List all tags created (`git tag`, `gh release list`)
2. **PRs Merged:** List merged PRs with titles/descriptions (`gh pr list --state merged`)
3. **Commits:** Count commits on main branch (`git log --oneline`)
4. **Active Branches:** List branches with recent commits not yet merged
5. **Release Notes:** Read GitHub Release notes if available
6. **README:** Extract business description from README.md

**Data Gathering Commands:**
```bash
# For each repo:
cd /path/to/repo
git fetch --all --tags
git tag --sort=-creatordate  # List tags
gh release list --limit 100  # Release notes
gh pr list --state merged --search "merged:>=YYYY-MM-DD" --json number,title,body
git log --oneline --since="YYYY-MM-DD" --until="YYYY-MM-DD" main
git branch -r --sort=-committerdate  # Active branches
```

**Output:** `docs/pmo/delivery-reports/{date}/analysis-data.md`

---

### Gate 2.5: Deep Code Analysis (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This gate CANNOT be skipped for speed.**

**Objective:** Understand actual code changes and their impact using specialized agents

**Core Principle: Quality Over Speed**

| Priority | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **#1** | Deep understanding of changes |
| **#2** | Accurate business value |
| **#3** | Quality insights |
| **Last** | Speed of execution |

**FORBIDDEN:**
- ❌ Using `general-purpose` agent for parallel speed
- ❌ Reading only PR titles without code analysis
- ❌ Skipping this gate to save time
- ❌ Estimating impact without reading code

**REQUIRED:**
- ✅ Use specialized agents per repository type
- ✅ Read actual code diffs of significant PRs
- ✅ Analyze architectural decisions
- ✅ Extract true business impact from code

**Agent Selection Per Repository:**

| Repository Type | Agent to Dispatch | Why |
|----------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Backend Go** | `ring:backend-engineer-golang` | Deep Go expertise, architectural analysis |
| **Backend TypeScript** | `ring:backend-engineer-typescript` | TS/Node API analysis |
| **Frontend React/Next** | `ring:frontend-engineer` | UI/UX impact analysis |
| **Infrastructure** | `ring:devops-engineer` | Deployment, scaling impact |
| **Tests** | `ring:qa-analyst` | Quality improvements analysis |
| **Unknown/Mixed** | `ring:codebase-explorer` | Comprehensive exploration |

**Analysis Workflow:**

```markdown
For each repository:

1. **Identify Technology Stack**
   - Read package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt
   - Determine primary language

2. **Dispatch Appropriate Specialized Agent**
   Task(
     subagent_type="ring:backend-engineer-golang",  # or appropriate
     prompt="""
     Analyze {repo_name} deliveries for period {start} to {end}.

     PRs to analyze: {pr_list}

     For each significant PR (>100 lines changed):
     1. Read code diff
     2. Identify technical changes
     3. Assess architecture/design decisions
     4. Extract business impact
     5. Identify quality improvements

     Provide business value statements suitable for executives.
     Format: "What was built + Why it matters + Who benefits"
     """
   )

3. **Aggregate Agent Insights**
   - Collect business value statements from all agents
   - Group by theme/product
   - Prioritize by impact level

4. **Verify Understanding**
   - Spot-check agent analysis by reading key diffs
   - Confirm business value accuracy
   - Add missing context
```

**Time Expectations (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
- 1 repository = 5-10 minutes of deep analysis
- 8 repositories = 40-80 minutes total
- Quality cannot be rushed

**Output:** `docs/pmo/delivery-reports/{date}/deep-code-analysis.md`

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Specialized agent used for each repo type
- [ ] Significant PRs analyzed with code reading
- [ ] Business value extracted from code, not just titles
- [ ] Agent insights aggregated and verified
- [ ] No "too vague" statements (e.g., "various improvements")

**If pressured to skip this gate:**
```
BLOCKER: Attempt to skip deep code analysis
Reason: "Too many repos" / "Takes too long" / "Use general-purpose"
Response: Deep analysis is MANDATORY. Quality over speed.
Action: Will proceed with proper specialized agent analysis.
```

---

### Gate 3: Business Value Extraction

**Objective:** Transform technical changes into business value statements

**Actions:**
1. Analyze PR titles/descriptions for business intent
2. Group deliveries by theme (new features, security, performance, etc.)
3. Identify first releases (v1.0.0 = new product)
4. Extract client/user impact from commit messages
5. Identify "work in progress" from active branches

**Business Value Framework:**
- **What was built?** (Technical)
- **Why does it matter?** (Business impact)
- **Who benefits?** (Users, clients, team)

**Example Transformation:**
- ❌ Bad: "Updated library X to version Y"
- ✅ Good: "Enhanced login security by updating authentication library, protecting user data from vulnerability Z"

**Output:** `docs/pmo/delivery-reports/{date}/business-value.md`

---

### Gate 4: Slide Generation

**Objective:** Create visual HTML presentation

**Slide Structure (8-12 slides):**

1. **Capa (Cover Slide)**
   - Title: "Entregas de Produtos [Squad/Company Name]"
   - Subtitle: "Resumo Executivo"
   - Period: "DD a DD de MÊS de YYYY" (Portuguese format, e.g., "12 a 31 de Janeiro de 2026")
   - Key metrics: Novos Produtos, Releases, PRs, Commits
   - Agility metric: "Média de X releases por dia"

2. **Resumo Executivo (Executive Summary)**
   - One paragraph summary
   - 3-4 main highlights

3-N. **Detalhamento por Produto/Tema (Detail Slides)**
   - Group deliveries by product or theme
   - 2-3 bullets per product with business value
   - Connect technical changes to business outcomes

N. **Próximos Passos (Next Steps)**
   - Based on active branches analysis
   - 2-3 upcoming initiatives

N+1. **Encerramento (Closing)**
   - Thank you / Questions slide

**HTML Template Structure:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Delivery Report</title>
  <style>
    /* CSS with selected visual identity */
    body { background: var(--bg-color); font-family: var(--font); }
    .slide { min-height: 100vh; padding: 4rem; }
    /* ... responsive layout, print styles ... */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="slide cover"><!-- Cover content --></div>
  <div class="slide summary"><!-- Summary content --></div>
  <!-- Product/theme slides -->
  <div class="slide next-steps"><!-- Next steps --></div>
  <div class="slide closing"><!-- Closing --></div>
</body>
</html>
```

**Output:** `docs/pmo/delivery-reports/{date}/delivery-report-{date}.html`

---

### Gate 5: Review and Delivery

**Objective:** Validate quality and deliver

**Actions:**
1. Verify all metrics are accurate
2. Check business value statements are non-technical
3. Test HTML rendering (open in browser)
4. Verify print-to-PDF works correctly
5. Deliver file to user

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Metrics calculated correctly
- [ ] Business value statements are clear
- [ ] No overly technical jargon
- [ ] Visual identity applied correctly
- [ ] HTML renders properly in browser
- [ ] Print to PDF works (for sharing)

**Delivery:**

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Delivery Reporting-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "8 repos = use general-purpose for speed" | general-purpose lacks domain expertise. Shallow analysis. | **Use specialized agents per repo** |
| "Too many repos, need to be fast" | Speed over quality produces meaningless insights. | **Take time for deep analysis** |
| "PR titles are enough, skip code" | Titles don't reveal actual impact. Code does. | **Read code diffs with agents** |
| "Parallel analysis for speed" | Parallel without depth = superficial understanding. | **Sequential deep analysis** |
| "Skip Gate 2.5, too time-consuming" | Code analysis is the SOURCE of business value. | **Gate 2.5 MANDATORY** |
| "Accept repo name without org" | Cannot clone without org/owner. Ambiguous. | **Validate format: org/repo or URL** |
| "Git data is accurate enough" | Tags/PRs can be incomplete. Verify with gh CLI. | **Use both git and gh commands** |
| "Skip business context, data speaks" | Data without context lacks meaning for executives. | **Always include business context** |
| "Technical language is fine" | Executives need business value, not tech details. | **Translate to business impact** |
| "One visual identity works for all" | Branding matters. Ask user preference. | **Always ask for visual identity** |
| "Skip active branches analysis" | Future work visibility manages expectations. | **Always include next steps** |

---

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

### Delivery Reporting-Specific Pressures

| Pressure Type | Request | Agent Response |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **Speed Pressure** | "8 repos is a lot, just be quick" | "Quality over speed. Will use specialized agents for deep analysis. Time: 40-80 minutes." |
| **Shortcut Pressure** | "Use general-purpose for parallel speed" | "general-purpose lacks expertise. Will use specialized agents sequentially for depth." |
| **Surface Analysis** | "Just read PR titles, that's enough" | "Titles omit impact. Will analyze actual code with specialized agents." |
| **Gate Skipping** | "Skip code analysis, save time" | "Code analysis is MANDATORY. Cannot skip Gate 2.5." |
| **Deadline Pressure** | "We need this in 10 minutes" | "Deep analysis cannot be rushed. Will prioritize accuracy over arbitrary deadlines." |
| **Data Manipulation** | "Inflate the numbers" | "Cannot misrepresent data. Will report accurate metrics with business context." |
| **Obfuscation** | "Make it more technical" | "Report is for executives. Will use business language with technical accuracy." |
| **Estimation** | "Skip the Git analysis, use estimates" | "Git data is the source of truth. Analysis is required for accuracy." |
| **Template Reuse** | "Use last month's template" | "Each period has unique deliveries. Will generate fresh analysis." |

---

## Blocker Criteria - STOP and Report

**ALWAYS pause and report blocker for:**

| Situation | Required Action |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Pressure to skip Gate 2.5** | STOP. Report: "Deep code analysis MANDATORY. Cannot skip for speed." |
| **Request to use general-purpose** | STOP. Report: "Specialized agents required for quality. Will not compromise." |
| **Unrealistic deadline (<30 min)** | STOP. Report: "8 repos require 40-80 min for proper analysis. Quality cannot be rushed." |
| **Attempt to skip code reading** | STOP. Report: "Code analysis is source of business value. Titles insufficient." |
| Git repository not accessible | STOP. Cannot analyze without repo access. Verify permissions. |
| GitHub CLI not configured | STOP. Need gh auth for PR/release data. Setup required. |
| Date range produces no data | STOP. Verify period is correct or report "no activity". |
| Visual identity not specified | STOP. Must ask user preference before generating HTML. |

### Cannot Be Overridden

**The following requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

| Requirement | Cannot Override Because |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Deep code analysis (Gate 2.5)** | Shallow analysis produces meaningless business value |
| **Specialized agents per repo type** | Domain expertise required for accurate understanding |
| **Git data verification** | Cannot report without source data |
| **Business value extraction** | Technical jargon doesn't serve executives |
| **Visual identity selection** | Branding consistency is required |

**If user insists on violating these:**
1. Escalate to orchestrator
2. Do NOT generate report without proper analysis
3. Document the request and your refusal

---

## Severity Calibration

When determining delivery significance:

| Severity | Criteria | Prominence in Report |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **CRITICAL** | New product launch (v1.0.0), major strategic feature | Lead slide, detailed coverage, executive highlight |
| **HIGH** | Multiple releases, significant PRs, architectural changes | Dedicated slide or major section |
| **MEDIUM** | Bug fixes, minor enhancements, tech debt | Brief mention in summary |
| **LOW** | Dependency updates, refactoring, documentation | Aggregated stats only |

**Lead with CRITICAL and HIGH. Aggregate MEDIUM and LOW. Never inflate significance.**

---

## When Delivery Report is Not Needed

**If no significant deliveries in period:**

Signs of minimal activity:
- Zero releases/tags created
- Fewer than 5 PRs merged
- Only maintenance commits (no new features)
- No active branches with work in progress

**Action:** Report "Low activity period" with exact metrics, suggest extending date range or focusing on other squads.

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT manufacture content when activity is minimal. Report reality.

---

## Example Business Value Statements

### Bad (Too Technical)
- "Migrated from Express 4.x to Express 5.x"
- "Implemented Redis caching layer"
- "Updated TypeScript to 5.3"

### Good (Business Value)
- "Improved API response time by 40% through caching optimization, enhancing user experience"
- "Modernized backend framework to latest security standards, protecting customer data"
- "Reduced technical debt by updating core dependencies, improving system stability"

---

## Metrics Calculation Examples

### Releases per Day
```
releases_per_day = total_releases / days_in_period
Example: 15 releases / 20 days = 0.75 releases/day
Display: "Média de 0.75 releases por dia" ou "~1 release por dia"
```

### Release Distribution
```
stable_releases = tags matching v*.*.* (not beta/rc)
beta_releases = tags matching *-beta.*
rc_releases = tags matching *-rc.*
```

### Project Status Classification
```
- New Product: first v1.0.0 tag in period
- Active Development: multiple releases (>= 3)
- Maintenance: few commits, no major releases
- Inactive: no commits in period
```
