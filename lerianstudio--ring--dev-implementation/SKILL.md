# Code Implementation (Gate 0)

## Overview

This skill executes the implementation phase of the development cycle:
- Selects the appropriate specialized agent based on task content
- Applies project standards from docs/PROJECT_RULES.md
- Follows TDD methodology (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Documents implementation decisions

## CRITICAL: Role Clarification

**This skill ORCHESTRATES. Agents IMPLEMENT.**

| Who | Responsibility |
|-----|----------------|
| **This Skill** | Select agent, prepare prompts, track state, validate outputs |
| **Implementation Agent** | Write tests, write code, follow standards |

---

## Step 1: Validate Input

<verify_before_proceed>
- unit_id exists
- requirements exists
- language is valid (go|typescript|python)
- service_type is valid (api|worker|batch|cli|frontend|bff)
</verify_before_proceed>

```text
REQUIRED INPUT (from ring:dev-cycle orchestrator):
- unit_id: [task/subtask being implemented]
- requirements: [acceptance criteria or task description]
- language: [go|typescript|python]
- service_type: [api|worker|batch|cli|frontend|bff]

OPTIONAL INPUT:
- technical_design: [path to design doc]
- existing_patterns: [patterns to follow]
- project_rules_path: [default: docs/PROJECT_RULES.md]

if any REQUIRED input is missing:
  → STOP and report: "Missing required input: [field]"
  → Return to orchestrator with error
```

## Step 2: Validate Prerequisites

<block_condition>
- PROJECT_RULES.md does not exist at project_rules_path
</block_condition>

If condition is true, STOP and return error to orchestrator.

```text
1. Check PROJECT_RULES.md exists:
   Read tool → project_rules_path (default: docs/PROJECT_RULES.md)
   
   if not found:
     → STOP with blocker: "Cannot implement without project standards"
     → Return error to orchestrator

2. Select implementation agent based on language:
   
   | Language | Service Type | Agent |
   |----------|--------------|-------|
   | go | api, worker, batch, cli | ring:backend-engineer-golang |
   | typescript | api, worker | ring:backend-engineer-typescript |
   | typescript | frontend, bff | frontend-bff-engineer-typescript |
   
   Store: selected_agent = [agent name]
```

## Step 3: Initialize Implementation State

```text
implementation_state = {
  unit_id: [from input],
  agent: selected_agent,
  tdd_red: {
    status: "pending",
    test_file: null,
    failure_output: null
  },
  tdd_green: {
    status: "pending",
    implementation_files: [],
    pass_output: null
  },
  files_created: [],
  files_modified: [],
  commit_sha: null
}
```

## Step 4: Gate 0.1 - TDD-RED (Write Failing Test)

<dispatch_required agent="[selected_agent]">
Write failing test for unit_id following TDD-RED methodology.
</dispatch_required>

```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: "[selected_agent]"  # e.g., "ring:backend-engineer-golang"
  description: "TDD-RED: Write failing test for [unit_id]"
  prompt: |
    ⛔ TDD-RED PHASE: Write a FAILING Test

    ## Input Context
    - **Unit ID:** [unit_id]
    - **Requirements:** [requirements]
    - **Language:** [language]
    - **Service Type:** [service_type]

    ## Project Standards
    Read and follow: [project_rules_path]

    ## Ring Standards Reference (Modular)
    Go modules: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang/{module}.md`
    For TS: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/typescript.md`
    **Go minimum for tests:** WebFetch `quality.md` → Testing section for test conventions.
    Multi-Tenant: Implement DUAL-MODE from the start (Go only). Use resolvers for all resources — they work transparently in both single-tenant and multi-tenant mode. See TDD-GREEN prompt for full Dual-Mode Implementation section and the sub-package import table.
    WebFetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang/multi-tenant.md` for patterns.

    ## Frontend TDD Policy (React/Next.js only)
    If the component is purely visual/presentational (layout, styling, animations,
    static display with no behavioral logic), TDD-RED is NOT required.
    Instead, implement the component directly and defer testing to Gate 4 (Visual
    Testing / Snapshots). Report: "Visual-only component → TDD-RED skipped, Gate 4 snapshots apply."

    Behavioral components (custom hooks, form validation, state management,
    conditional rendering, API integration) MUST follow TDD-RED below.

    ## Your Task
    1. Write a test that captures the expected behavior
    2. The test MUST FAIL (no implementation exists yet)
    3. Run the test and capture the FAILURE output

    ## Requirements for Test
    - Follow project naming conventions from PROJECT_RULES.md
    - Use table-driven tests (Go) or describe/it blocks (TS)
    - Test the happy path and edge cases
    - Include meaningful assertion messages

    ## Required Output Format

    ### Test File
    **Path:** [path/to/test_file]
    
    ```[language]
    [test code]
    ```

    ### Test Execution
    **Command:** [test command]
    **Result:** FAIL (expected)

    ### Failure Output (MANDATORY)
    ```
    [paste actual test failure output here]
    ```

    ⛔ HARD GATE: You MUST include actual failure output.
    Without failure output, TDD-RED is not complete.
```

## Step 5: Validate TDD-RED Output

<block_condition>
- failure_output is missing
- failure_output does not contain "FAIL"
</block_condition>

If any condition is true, re-dispatch agent with clarification.

```text
Parse agent output:

1. Extract test file path
2. Extract failure output

if failure_output is missing or does not contain "FAIL":
  → STOP: "TDD-RED incomplete - no failure output captured"
  → Re-dispatch agent with clarification

if failure_output contains "FAIL":
  → implementation_state.tdd_red = {
      status: "completed",
      test_file: [extracted path],
      failure_output: [extracted output]
    }
  → Proceed to Step 6
```

## Step 6: Gate 0.2 - TDD-GREEN (Implementation)

**PREREQUISITE:** `implementation_state.tdd_red.status == "completed"`

<dispatch_required agent="[selected_agent]">
Implement code to make test pass following TDD-GREEN methodology.
</dispatch_required>

```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: "[selected_agent]"
  description: "TDD-GREEN: Implement code to pass test for [unit_id]"
  prompt: |
    ⛔ TDD-GREEN PHASE: Make the Test PASS

    ## Input Context
    - **Unit ID:** [unit_id]
    - **Requirements:** [requirements]
    - **Language:** [language]
    - **Service Type:** [service_type]

    ## TDD-RED Results (from previous phase)
    - **Test File:** [implementation_state.tdd_red.test_file]
    - **Failure Output:**
    ```
    [implementation_state.tdd_red.failure_output]
    ```

    ## Project Standards
    Read and follow: [project_rules_path]

    ## Ring Standards Reference (Modular — Load by Task Type)
    
    **⛔ MANDATORY: WebFetch the MODULAR standards files below, NOT the monolithic golang.md.**
    The standards are split into focused modules. Load the ones relevant to your task type.
    
    ### Go — Module Loading Guide
    Base URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang/`
    
    | Task Type | REQUIRED Modules to WebFetch |
    |-----------|----------------------------|
    | New feature (full) | `core.md` → `bootstrap.md` → `domain.md` → `quality.md` → `api-patterns.md` |
    | API endpoint | `core.md` → `api-patterns.md` → `domain.md` → `quality.md` |
    | Auth / Security | `core.md` → `security.md` |
    | Database work | `core.md` → `domain.md` → `domain-modeling.md` |
    | Messaging / RabbitMQ | `core.md` → `messaging.md` |
    | Infra / Bootstrap | `core.md` → `bootstrap.md` |
    | Any task | `core.md` is ALWAYS required (lib-commons, license headers, dependency management) |
    
    ### TypeScript
    URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/typescript.md`
    
    Multi-Tenant: Implement DUAL-MODE from the start. Use lib-commons v4 resolvers for ALL resources.
    WebFetch: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang/multi-tenant.md`
    
    ## ⛔ Multi-Tenant Dual-Mode Implementation (Go backend only — skip for TypeScript/Frontend)
    
    **Applies only when `language == "go"`.** TypeScript and frontend projects have different patterns.
    
    All Go backend code must work in BOTH modes from the start. The lib-commons v4 resolvers handle both transparently — in single-tenant mode they return the default connection, in multi-tenant mode they resolve per-tenant. There is NO post-cycle adaptation step.
    
    ### Sub-Package Import Reference
    
    | Alias | Import Path | Purpose |
    |-------|-------------|---------|
    | `tmcore` | `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v4/commons/tenant-manager/core` | Resolvers, context helpers, types |
    | `tmmiddleware` | `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v4/commons/tenant-manager/middleware` | TenantMiddleware, WhenEnabled |
    | `tmpostgres` | `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v4/commons/tenant-manager/postgres` | PostgresManager |
    | `tmmongo` | `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v4/commons/tenant-manager/mongo` | MongoManager |
    | `tmrabbitmq` | `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v4/commons/tenant-manager/rabbitmq` | RabbitMQ Manager (vhost isolation) |
    | `valkey` | `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v4/commons/tenant-manager/valkey` | Redis key prefixing |
    | `s3` | `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v4/commons/tenant-manager/s3` | S3 key prefixing |
    
    ### Resource Resolver Rules (ALL resources the service uses)
    
    | Resource | Single-Tenant Pattern (WRONG) | Dual-Mode Pattern (CORRECT) |
    |----------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
    | **PostgreSQL** | `r.connection.GetDB()` | `tmcore.GetPGContext(ctx)` with fallback to `r.connection` |
    | **PostgreSQL (multi-module)** | `r.connection.GetDB()` | `tmcore.GetPGContext(ctx, module)` with fallback to `r.connection` |
    | **MongoDB** | `r.mongoConn.GetDatabase()` | `tmcore.GetMBContext(ctx)` or `tmcore.GetMBContext(ctx, module)` with fallback |
    | **Redis/Valkey** | `redis.Set("key", val)` | `redis.Set(valkey.GetKeyContext(ctx, "key"), val)` |
    | **S3** | `s3.PutObject("path/obj")` | `s3.PutObject(s3.GetS3KeyStorageContext(ctx, "path/obj"))` |
    | **RabbitMQ** | `channel.Publish(exchange, ...)` | Use `tmrabbitmq.Manager` for vhost isolation + set `X-Tenant-ID` header |
    
    ### Route Registration with WhenEnabled
    
    Routes that need tenant context must use `WhenEnabled` — it's a no-op in single-tenant mode:
    
    ```go
    // Auth MUST run before tenant middleware (per-route, not global)
    app.Get("/accounts/:id",
        authMiddleware.Handle,                    // Always runs
        multiTenantMiddleware.WhenEnabled(),      // No-op when MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED=false
        handler.GetAccount,
    )
    ```
    
    ### Backward Compatibility Rule
    
    The service must work correctly with ZERO `MULTI_TENANT_*` environment variables set. This is the single-tenant default. The resolvers handle this transparently — when `MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED` is not set or is `false`, they return the default connection.
    
    ### Verification (Go only)
    
    The agent must verify before completing Gate 0:
    - No direct `r.connection.GetDB()` or `r.mongoConn.GetDatabase()` — must use resolvers
    - No hardcoded Redis keys — must use `valkey.GetKeyContext`
    - No hardcoded S3 keys — must use `s3.GetS3KeyStorageContext`
    - No global DB singletons — connections injected via constructor
    - All methods accept `ctx context.Context` as first parameter
    - Routes use `WhenEnabled()` for tenant middleware (not global `app.Use`)
    - RabbitMQ uses `tmrabbitmq.Manager` (not direct channel operations)
    
    If any check fails → refactor before gate passes. Do NOT defer to a post-cycle step.

    ## ⛔ FILE SIZE ENFORCEMENT (MANDATORY)
    See [shared-patterns/file-size-enforcement.md](../shared-patterns/file-size-enforcement.md)
    - You MUST NOT create or modify files to exceed 300 lines (including test files)
    - If implementing a feature would push a file past 300 lines, you MUST split it proactively
    - Split by responsibility boundaries (not arbitrary line counts)
    - **Go:** Each split file stays in the same package; all methods remain on the same receiver; verify with `go build ./... && go test ./...`
    - **TypeScript:** Split files stay in the same module/directory; update barrel exports (index.ts) if needed; verify with `tsc --noEmit && npm test`
    - Test files MUST be split to match source files
    - Files > 300 lines = loop back for split. Files > 500 lines = HARD BLOCK.
    - Reference: golang/domain.md → File Organization (MANDATORY), typescript.md → File Organization (MANDATORY)

    ## ⛔ CRITICAL: all Ring Standards Apply (no DEFERRAL)
    
    **You MUST check ALL sections from the modules you loaded.** Not just telemetry — ALL of them.
    See Ring Standards for mandatory requirements including (but not limited to):
    - lib-commons usage (HARD GATE — no duplicate utils/helpers)
    - License headers on all source files
    - Structured JSON logging with trace_id correlation
    - OpenTelemetry instrumentation (spans in every function)
    - Error handling (no panic, wrap with context, sentinel errors)
    - Context propagation
    - Input validation (validator v10)
    - SQL safety (parameterized queries)
    - Secret redaction in logs
    - HTTP status code consistency (201 create, 200 update)
    - Handler constructor pattern (DI via constructor)
    - File organization (≤300 lines per file)
    - Function design (single responsibility, max 20-30 lines)
    - Database naming (snake_case)

    **⛔ HARD GATE:** If you output "DEFERRED" for any Ring Standard → Implementation is INCOMPLETE.

    ## Your Task
    1. Write MINIMAL code to make the test pass
    2. Follow all Ring Standards (logging, tracing, error handling)
    3. **Instrument all code with telemetry** (100% of handlers, services, repositories)
    4. Run the test and capture the PASS output

    ## ⛔ MANDATORY: Telemetry Instrumentation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

    <cannot_skip>
    - 90%+ instrumentation coverage required
    - WebFetch standards file before implementation
    - Follow exact patterns from standards
    - Output Standards Coverage Table with evidence
    </cannot_skip>

    **every function that does work MUST be instrumented with telemetry.**
    This is not optional. This is not "nice to have". This is REQUIRED.

    ### What "Instrumented" Means
    1. **Extract logger/tracer from context** (not create new ones)
    2. **Create a child span** for the operation
    3. **Defer span.End()** immediately
    4. **Use structured logging** correlated with trace
    5. **Handle errors with span attribution** (business vs technical)

    ### Language-Specific Patterns (MANDATORY)

    **⛔ HARD GATE: Agent MUST WebFetch modular standards files BEFORE writing any code.**
    
    Use the Module Loading Guide above to determine which modules to load.
    **Minimum for ANY Go task:** `core.md` (lib-commons, license headers, deps, MongoDB patterns)
    
    | Language | Standards Modules | REQUIRED Sections to WebFetch |
    |----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
    | **Go** | See Module Loading Guide above | ALL sections from loaded modules (use `standards-coverage-table.md` → `ring:backend-engineer-golang` section index) |
    | **TypeScript** | `typescript.md` | ALL 15 sections from `standards-coverage-table.md` → `ring:backend-engineer-typescript` |
    | **All** | N/A (post-cycle ring:dev-multi-tenant) | Multi-tenant adaptation happens after dev-cycle completes |

    **⛔ NON-NEGOTIABLE: Agent MUST implement EXACTLY the patterns from standards. no deviations. no shortcuts.**

    | Requirement | Enforcement |
    |-------------|-------------|
    | WebFetch modular standards files | MANDATORY before implementation |
    | Follow exact patterns | REQUIRED - copy structure from standards |
    | Output Standards Coverage Table | REQUIRED - with file:line evidence for ALL loaded sections |
    | 90%+ instrumentation coverage | HARD GATE - implementation REJECTED if below |
    | All loaded sections ✅ or N/A | HARD GATE - any ❌ = REJECTED |

    ### ⛔ FORBIDDEN Patterns (HARD BLOCK)
    
    **Agent MUST WebFetch standards and check Anti-Patterns table. Violations = REJECTED.**

    - **Go:** `golang.md` → "Anti-Patterns" table - MUST check all rows
    - **TypeScript:** `typescript.md` → "Anti-Patterns" table - MUST check all rows

    **If agent uses any forbidden pattern → Implementation is INVALID. Start over.**

    ### Verification (MANDATORY)
    
    **Agent MUST output Standards Coverage Table per `standards-coverage-table.md`.**
    
    - all sections MUST show ✅ or N/A
    - any ❌ = Implementation REJECTED
    - Missing table = Implementation INCOMPLETE

    ## Required Output Format

    ### Implementation Files
    | File | Action | Lines |
    |------|--------|-------|
    | [path] | Created/Modified | +/-N |

    ### Code
    **Path:** [path/to/implementation_file]
    
    ```[language]
    [implementation code]
    ```

    ### Test Execution
    **Command:** [test command]
    **Result:** PASS

    ### Pass Output (MANDATORY)
    ```
    [paste actual test pass output here]
    ```

    ### Standards Coverage Table (MANDATORY)
    
    **Standards Modules Loaded:** [list modules WebFetched]
    **Total Sections Checked:** [N]
    
    | # | Section (from standards) | Status | Evidence |
    |---|------------------------|--------|----------|
    | 1 | [section name] | ✅/⚠️/❌/N/A | file:line or reason |
    | ... | ... | ... | ... |
    
    **Completeness:** [N] sections checked / [N] total = ✅ Complete
    
    ⛔ This table is MANDATORY. Missing table = Implementation INCOMPLETE.
    ⛔ Any ❌ = Implementation REJECTED. Fix before proceeding.

    ### Standards Compliance Summary
    
    **Quick reference derived from the Standards Coverage Table above.**
    If any item is ❌ here, it MUST also appear as ❌ in the Coverage Table with file:line evidence.
    
    - lib-commons Usage: ✅/❌
    - License Headers: ✅/❌
    - Structured Logging: ✅/❌
    - OpenTelemetry Spans: ✅/❌
    - Error Handling: ✅/❌
    - Context Propagation: ✅/❌
    - Input Validation: ✅/❌/N/A
    - SQL Safety: ✅/❌/N/A
    - File Size (≤300 lines): ✅/❌

    ### Commit
    **SHA:** [commit hash after implementation]
```

## Step 7: Validate TDD-GREEN Output

```text
Parse agent output:

1. Extract implementation files
2. Extract pass output
3. Extract standards compliance
4. Extract commit SHA

if pass_output is missing or does not contain "PASS":
  → STOP: "TDD-GREEN incomplete - test not passing"
  → Re-dispatch agent with error details

if Standards Coverage Table is missing:
  → STOP: "Standards Coverage Table not provided - implementation INCOMPLETE"
  → Re-dispatch agent: "You MUST output a Standards Coverage Table with one row per section from the modules you loaded. See standards-coverage-table.md for format."

if any section in Standards Coverage Table is ❌:
  → STOP: "Standards not met - [list ❌ sections with evidence]"
  → Re-dispatch agent to fix specific sections

if any standards compliance summary is ❌:
  → STOP: "Standards not met - [list failing standards]"
  → Re-dispatch agent to fix

if pass_output contains "PASS" and all standards ✅ and Standards Coverage Table complete:
  → Run file-size verification (see shared-patterns/file-size-enforcement.md):
    Go: find . -name "*.go" ! -path "*/mocks*" ! -path "*/generated/*" ! -path "*/gen/*" ! -name "*.pb.go" ! -name "*.gen.go" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '$1 > 300 && $NF != "total" {print}' | sort -rn
    TS: find . \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" \) ! -path "*/node_modules/*" ! -path "*/dist/*" ! -path "*/build/*" ! -path "*/generated/*" ! -path "*/__mocks__/*" ! -name "*.d.ts" ! -name "*.gen.ts" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '$1 > 300 && $NF != "total" {print}' | sort -rn
  
  if any file > 500 lines:
    → HARD BLOCK: "File [path] has [N] lines (max 500). MUST split before proceeding."
    → Re-dispatch agent with split instructions from shared-patterns/file-size-enforcement.md

  if any file > 300 lines:
    → LOOP BACK: "File [path] has [N] lines (max 300). Split by responsibility boundaries."
    → Re-dispatch agent with file path and split strategy suggestion

  → Run linting verification (R4 — quality.md mandates 14 linters):
    Go: if .golangci.yml exists, run: golangci-lint run ./...
         if .golangci.yml does not exist, flag as warning (quality.md requires it)
    TypeScript: if eslint config exists, run: npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx
  
  if linting fails:
    → Re-dispatch agent: "Linting failed. Fix all lint issues before proceeding. Output: [lint errors]"
  
  → Run license header check (R5 — core.md License Headers MANDATORY):
    For each file in [files_created + files_modified] matching *.go, *.ts, *.tsx:
      Check first 10 lines for: copyright|licensed|spdx|license (case-insensitive)
      If not found → flag as missing

  if any file missing license header:
    → Re-dispatch agent: "Missing license headers in: [file list]. Add license headers per core.md → License Headers (MANDATORY)."

  if all checks pass:
    → implementation_state.tdd_green = {
        status: "completed",
        implementation_files: [extracted files],
        pass_output: [extracted output],
        commit_sha: [extracted SHA],
        file_size: "PASS",
        linting: "PASS",
        license_headers: "PASS"
      }
    → Proceed to Step 8
```

## Step 8: Prepare Output

```text
Generate skill output:

## Implementation Summary
**Status:** PASS
**Unit ID:** [unit_id]
**Agent:** [selected_agent]
**Commit:** [commit_sha]

## TDD Results
| Phase | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| RED | ✅ | [first line of failure_output] |
| GREEN | ✅ | [first line of pass_output] |

## Files Changed
| File | Action | Lines |
|------|--------|-------|
[table from implementation_files]

**Files Created:** [count]
**Files Modified:** [count]
**Tests Added:** [count]

## Standards Compliance
- Structured Logging: ✅
- OpenTelemetry Spans: ✅
- Error Handling: ✅
- Context Propagation: ✅
- File Size (≤300 lines): ✅
## Handoff to Next Gate
- Implementation status: COMPLETE
- Code compiles: ✅

- Ready for Gate 1 (DevOps): YES
- Environment needs: [list any new deps, env vars, services]
```

## Severity Calibration

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | TDD bypassed, no test exists, security vulnerability | Skipped RED phase, missing test file, exposed credentials |
| **HIGH** | Standards non-compliance, missing observability | No telemetry spans, missing error handling, raw OTel usage |
| **MEDIUM** | Code quality issues, incomplete implementation | Partial telemetry coverage, non-standard patterns |
| **LOW** | Style improvements, documentation gaps | Naming conventions, missing comments |

Report all severities. CRITICAL = immediate block. HIGH = fix before proceeding. MEDIUM = fix in iteration. LOW = document.

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

| User Says | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Skip TDD, just implement" | "TDD is MANDATORY. Dispatching agent for RED phase." |
| "Code exists, just add tests" | "DELETE existing code. TDD requires test-first." |
| "Add observability later" | "Observability is part of implementation. Agent MUST add it now." |

---

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Gate 0-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Test passes on first run" | Passing test ≠ TDD. Test MUST fail first. | **Rewrite test to fail first** |
| "Skip RED, go straight to GREEN" | RED proves test validity | **Execute RED phase first** |
| "I'll add observability later" | Later = never. Observability is part of GREEN. | **Add logging + tracing NOW** |
| "Minimal code = no logging" | Minimal = pass test. Logging is a standard, not extra. | **Include observability** |
| "DEFERRED to later tasks" | DEFERRED = FAILED. Standards are not deferrable. | **Implement all standards NOW** |
| "Using raw OTel is fine" | lib-commons wrappers are MANDATORY for consistency | **Use libCommons.NewTrackingFromContext** |
| "c.JSON() works the same" | Direct Fiber breaks response standardization | **Use libHTTP.OK(), libHTTP.WithError()** |
| "This function is too simple for spans" | Simple ≠ exempt. all functions need spans. | **Add span to every function** |
| "Telemetry adds overhead" | Observability is non-negotiable for production | **Instrument 100% of code paths** |

### ⛔ Post-Generation Panic Check (MANDATORY)

Before delivering ANY generated code, run these checks:

| Check | Command | Expected | If Found |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| No panic() | `grep -rn "panic(" --include="*.go" --exclude="*_test.go"` | 0 results | Rewrite to return error |
| No log.Fatal() | `grep -rn "log.Fatal" --include="*.go"` | 0 results | Rewrite to return error |
| No Must* helpers | `grep -rn "Must[A-Z]" --include="*.go" \| grep -v "regexp\.MustCompile"` | 0 results | Rewrite to return (T, error) |
| No os.Exit() | `grep -rn "os.Exit" --include="*.go" --exclude="main.go"` | 0 results | Move to main() or return error |

**If any check fails: DO NOT deliver. Fix first.**

## Agent Selection Guide

| Language | Service Type | Condition | Agent |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Go | API, Worker, Batch, CLI | - | `ring:backend-engineer-golang` |
| TypeScript | API, Worker | - | `ring:backend-engineer-typescript` |
| TypeScript | Frontend, BFF | No product-designer outputs | `ring:frontend-bff-engineer-typescript` |
| TypeScript | Frontend | ux-criteria.md exists | `ring:ui-engineer` |
| React/CSS | Design, Styling | - | `ring:frontend-designer` |

**ui-engineer Selection:**
When implementing frontend features with product-designer outputs (ux-criteria.md, user-flows.md, wireframes/), use `ring:ui-engineer` instead of `ring:frontend-bff-engineer-typescript`. The ui-engineer specializes in translating design specifications into production code while ensuring all UX criteria are satisfied.
