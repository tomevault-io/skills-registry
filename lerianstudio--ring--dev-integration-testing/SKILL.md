# Dev Integration Testing (Gate 6)

## Overview

Ensure every integration scenario has at least one **integration test** proving real external dependencies work correctly. Use testcontainers for all external services.

**Core principle:** Unit tests mock dependencies, integration tests verify real behavior. Both are required.

<block_condition>
- Any integration scenario without test = FAIL
- Any test using production services = FAIL
- Any test with hardcoded ports = FAIL
- Any flaky test (fails on retry) = FAIL
</block_condition>

## CRITICAL: Role Clarification

**This skill ORCHESTRATES. QA Analyst Agent (integration mode) EXECUTES.**

| Who | Responsibility |
|-----|----------------|
| **This Skill** | Gather scenarios, check if needed, dispatch agent, validate output |
| **QA Analyst Agent** | Write tests, run coverage, verify quality gates |

---

## Step 0: Detect External Dependencies (Auto-Detection)

**MANDATORY:** When `external_dependencies` is empty or not provided, scan the codebase to detect them automatically before validation.

```text
if external_dependencies is empty or not provided:

  detected_dependencies = []

  1. Scan docker-compose.yml / docker-compose.yaml for service images:
     - Grep tool: pattern "postgres" in docker-compose* files → add "postgres"
     - Grep tool: pattern "mongo" in docker-compose* files → add "mongodb"
     - Grep tool: pattern "valkey" in docker-compose* files → add "valkey"
     - Grep tool: pattern "redis" in docker-compose* files → add "redis"
     - Grep tool: pattern "rabbitmq" in docker-compose* files → add "rabbitmq"

  2. Scan dependency manifests:
     if language == "go":
       - Grep tool: pattern "github.com/lib/pq" in go.mod → add "postgres"
       - Grep tool: pattern "github.com/jackc/pgx" in go.mod → add "postgres"
       - Grep tool: pattern "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver" in go.mod → add "mongodb"
       - Grep tool: pattern "github.com/redis/go-redis" in go.mod → add "redis"
       - Grep tool: pattern "github.com/valkey-io/valkey-go" in go.mod → add "valkey"
       - Grep tool: pattern "github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go" in go.mod → add "rabbitmq"

     if language == "typescript":
       - Grep tool: pattern "\"pg\"" in package.json → add "postgres"
       - Grep tool: pattern "@prisma/client" in package.json → add "postgres"
       - Grep tool: pattern "\"mongodb\"" in package.json → add "mongodb"
       - Grep tool: pattern "\"mongoose\"" in package.json → add "mongodb"
       - Grep tool: pattern "\"redis\"" in package.json → add "redis"
       - Grep tool: pattern "\"ioredis\"" in package.json → add "redis"
       - Grep tool: pattern "@valkey" in package.json → add "valkey"
       - Grep tool: pattern "\"amqplib\"" in package.json → add "rabbitmq"
       - Grep tool: pattern "amqp-connection-manager" in package.json → add "rabbitmq"

  3. Deduplicate detected_dependencies
  4. Set external_dependencies = detected_dependencies

  Log: "Auto-detected external dependencies: [detected_dependencies]"
```

<auto_detect_reason>
PM team task files often omit external_dependencies. If the codebase uses postgres, mongodb, valkey, or rabbitmq, these are external dependencies that MUST have integration tests. Auto-detection prevents silent skips.
</auto_detect_reason>

---

## Step 1: Validate Input

```text
REQUIRED INPUT (from ring:dev-cycle orchestrator):
<verify_before_proceed>
- unit_id exists
- language is valid (go|typescript)
</verify_before_proceed>

OPTIONAL INPUT (determines if Gate 6 runs or skips):
- integration_scenarios: [list of scenarios] - if provided and non-empty, Gate 6 runs
- external_dependencies: [list of deps] (from input OR auto-detected in Step 0) - if non-empty, Gate 6 runs
- gate3_handoff: [full Gate 3 output]
- implementation_files: [files from Gate 0]

EXECUTION LOGIC:
1. if any REQUIRED input is missing:
   -> STOP and report: "Missing required input: [field]"
   -> Return to orchestrator with error

2. if integration_scenarios is empty AND external_dependencies is empty (AFTER auto-detection in Step 0):
   -> Gate 6 SKIP (document reason: "No integration scenarios or external dependencies found after codebase scan")
   -> Return skip result with status: "skipped"

3. Otherwise:
   -> Gate 6 REQUIRED - proceed to Step 2
```

## Step 2: Check If Integration Tests Needed

**Decision Tree:**

```text
1. Task has external_dependencies list (from input or auto-detected)?
   |
   +-- YES -> Gate 6 REQUIRED
   |
   +-- NO -> Continue to #2

2. Task has integration_scenarios?
   |
   +-- YES -> Gate 6 REQUIRED
   |
   +-- NO -> Continue to #3

3. Task acceptance criteria mention "integration", "database", "queue"?
   |
   +-- YES -> Gate 6 REQUIRED
   |
   +-- NO -> Gate 6 SKIP (with reason)
```

**If SKIP:**
```text
Return:
  status: SKIP
  skip_reason: "No external dependencies (after codebase scan) or integration scenarios identified"
  ready_for_gate7: YES
```

## Step 3: Initialize Testing State

```text
integration_state = {
  unit_id: [from input],
  scenarios: [from integration_scenarios or derived from external_dependencies],
  dependencies: [from external_dependencies],
  verdict: null,
  iterations: 0,
  max_iterations: 3,
  tests_passed: 0,
  tests_failed: 0,
  flaky_detected: 0
}
```

## Step 4: Dispatch QA Analyst Agent (Integration Mode)

<dispatch_required agent="ring:qa-analyst">
Write integration tests for all scenarios using testcontainers.
</dispatch_required>

```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: "ring:qa-analyst"
  description: "Integration testing for [unit_id]"
  prompt: |
    **test_mode: integration**

    ## Input Context
    - **Unit ID:** [unit_id]
    - **Language:** [language]

    ## Integration Scenarios to Test
    [list integration_scenarios with IS-1, IS-2, etc.]

    ## External Dependencies
    [list external_dependencies with container requirements]

    ## Standards Reference
    WebFetch: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang/testing-integration.md

    Focus on: All sections, especially INT-5 (Build Tags), INT-6 (Testcontainers), INT-7 (No t.Parallel())

    ## Requirements

    ### File Naming
    - Pattern: `*_integration_test.go`
    - Build tag: `//go:build integration` (MANDATORY at top of file)

    ### Function Naming
    - Pattern: `TestIntegration_{Component}_{Scenario}`
    - Example: `TestIntegration_UserRepository_Create`

    ### Container Usage
    - Use testcontainers for ALL external dependencies
    - Versions MUST match infra/docker-compose
    - Use t.Cleanup() for container termination

    ### Quality Rules
    - No t.Parallel() - integration tests run sequentially
    - No hardcoded ports - use dynamic ports from containers
    - No production services - all deps containerized
    - Each scenario MUST have at least one test

    ## Required Output Format

    ### Test Files Created
    | File | Tests | Lines |
    |------|-------|-------|
    | [path] | [count] | +N |

    ### Scenario Coverage
    | IS ID | Scenario | Test File | Test Function | Status |
    |-------|----------|-----------|---------------|--------|
    | IS-1 | [scenario text] | [file] | [function] | PASS/FAIL |
    | IS-2 | [scenario text] | [file] | [function] | PASS/FAIL |

    ### Quality Gate Results
    | Check | Status | Evidence |
    |-------|--------|----------|
    | Build tags present | PASS/FAIL | [file count] |
    | No hardcoded ports | PASS/FAIL | [grep result] |
    | Testcontainers used | PASS/FAIL | [imports] |
    | No t.Parallel() | PASS/FAIL | [grep result] |
    | Cleanup present | PASS/FAIL | [t.Cleanup count] |

    ### VERDICT
    **Tests:** [X passed, Y failed]
    **Quality Gate:** PASS / FAIL
    **VERDICT:** PASS / FAIL

    If FAIL:
    - **Gap Analysis:** [what needs more tests or fixes]
    - **Files needing attention:** [list with issues]
```

## Step 5: Parse QA Analyst Output

```text
Parse agent output:

1. Extract scenario coverage from Scenario Coverage table
2. Extract quality gate results
3. Extract verdict

integration_state.tests_passed = [count from output]
integration_state.tests_failed = [count from output]

if verdict == "PASS" and quality_gate == "PASS":
  -> integration_state.verdict = "PASS"
  -> Proceed to Step 7 (Success)

if verdict == "FAIL" or quality_gate == "FAIL":
  -> integration_state.verdict = "FAIL"
  -> integration_state.iterations += 1
  -> if iterations >= max_iterations: Go to Step 8 (Escalate)
  -> Go to Step 6 (Dispatch Fix)
```

## Step 6: Dispatch Fix to Implementation Agent

**Quality gate failed or tests failing -> Return to implementation agent**

```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: "[implementation_agent from Gate 0]"
  description: "Fix integration test issues for [unit_id]"
  prompt: |
    Integration Test Issues - Fix Required

    ## Current Status
    - **Tests Passed:** [tests_passed]
    - **Tests Failed:** [tests_failed]
    - **Quality Gate:** FAIL
    - **Iteration:** [iterations] of [max_iterations]

    ## Issues Found (from QA)
    [paste gap analysis from QA output]

    ## Files Needing Attention
    [paste files list from QA output]

    ## Requirements
    1. Fix the identified issues
    2. Ensure all containers use testcontainers
    3. Remove any t.Parallel() from integration tests
    4. Add missing t.Cleanup() calls
    5. Replace hardcoded ports with dynamic ports

    ## Required Output
    - Issues fixed: [list]
    - Files modified: [list]
```

After fix -> Go back to Step 4 (Re-dispatch QA Analyst)

## Step 7: Prepare Success Output

```text
Generate skill output:

## Integration Testing Summary
**Status:** PASS
**Unit ID:** [unit_id]
**Iterations:** [integration_state.iterations]

## Scenario Coverage
| IS ID | Scenario | Test | Status |
|-------|----------|------|--------|
[from integration_state]

**Scenarios Covered:** [X]/[Y] (100%)

## Quality Gate Results
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Build tags | PASS |
| No hardcoded ports | PASS |
| Testcontainers | PASS |
| No t.Parallel() | PASS |
| Cleanup present | PASS |
| No flaky tests | PASS |

## Handoff to Next Gate
- Integration testing status: COMPLETE
- Tests passed: [tests_passed]
- Tests failed: 0
- Flaky tests: 0
- Ready for Gate 7 (Chaos Testing): YES
```

## Step 8: Escalate - Max Iterations Reached

```text
Generate skill output:

## Integration Testing Summary
**Status:** FAIL
**Unit ID:** [unit_id]
**Iterations:** [max_iterations] (MAX REACHED)

## Gap Analysis
[from last QA output]

## Files Still Needing Fixes
[from last QA output]

## Handoff to Next Gate
- Integration testing status: FAILED
- Ready for Gate 4: NO
- **Action Required:** User must manually fix integration tests

ESCALATION: Max iterations (3) reached. Integration tests still failing.
User intervention required.
```

## Severity Calibration

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Production service used, data corruption risk | Tests hit production DB, no cleanup, hardcoded creds |
| **HIGH** | Missing scenarios, flaky tests | Untested integration scenario, test fails on retry |
| **MEDIUM** | Quality gate failures, port issues | Missing build tags, hardcoded ports, no t.Cleanup |
| **LOW** | Documentation, optimization | Missing test comments, slow container startup |

Report all severities. CRITICAL = immediate fix (production risk). HIGH = fix before gate pass. MEDIUM = fix in iteration. LOW = document.

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

| User Says | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Unit tests cover this" | "Unit tests mock dependencies. Integration tests verify real behavior. Both required." |
| "Testcontainers is too slow" | "Correctness > speed. Real dependencies catch real bugs." |
| "CI doesn't have Docker" | "Docker is baseline infrastructure. Fix CI before skipping integration tests." |
| "Skip integration, deadline" | "Integration bugs cost 10x more in production. Testing is non-negotiable." |

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Gate 6-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Database already tested in unit tests" | Unit tests use mocks, not real DB | **Write integration tests** |
| "Testcontainers setup is complex" | Complexity is one-time. Bugs are recurring. | **Use testcontainers** |
| "Integration tests are flaky" | Flaky = poorly written. Fix isolation. | **Fix the tests** |
| "No external dependencies" | Check task requirements. Often implicit. | **Verify with decision tree** |
| "t.Parallel() makes CI faster" | Faster but flaky. Flaky = worthless. | **Remove t.Parallel()** |
| "Hardcoded port works locally" | Fails in CI when port is taken. | **Use dynamic ports** |
| "Production DB is more realistic" | Production DB is dangerous and unreliable for tests. | **Use testcontainers** |

## Skip Conditions (Documented)

**When Gate 6 can be skipped (MUST document reason):**

| Condition | Skip Reason |
|-----------|-------------|
| No external dependencies | "Task has no database, API, or queue interactions" |
| Pure business logic | "Task is pure function/logic with no I/O" |
| Library/utility code | "Task is internal utility with no external calls" |
| Already covered | "Integration tests exist and pass (verified)" |

**When Gate 6 CANNOT be skipped:**

| Condition | Why Required |
|-----------|--------------|
| Task touches database | Database queries need real verification |
| Task calls external APIs | HTTP behavior varies from mocks |
| Task uses message queues | Pub/sub requires real broker testing |
| Task has transactions | ACID guarantees need real DB |
| Task has migrations | Schema changes need integration verification |
