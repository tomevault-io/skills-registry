# Dev Unit Testing (Gate 3)

## Overview

Ensure every acceptance criterion has at least one **unit test** proving it works. Follow TDD methodology: RED (failing test) -> GREEN (implementation) -> REFACTOR.

**Core principle:** Untested acceptance criteria are unverified claims. Each criterion MUST map to at least one executable unit test.

<block_condition>
- Coverage below 85% = FAIL
- Any acceptance criterion without test = FAIL
</block_condition>

**Coverage threshold:** 85% minimum (Ring standard). PROJECT_RULES.md can raise, not lower.

## CRITICAL: Role Clarification

**This skill ORCHESTRATES. QA Analyst Agent EXECUTES.**

| Who | Responsibility |
|-----|----------------|
| **This Skill** | Gather requirements, dispatch agent, track iterations |
| **QA Analyst Agent** | Write tests, run coverage, report results |

---

## Step 1: Validate Input

```text
REQUIRED INPUT (from ring:dev-cycle orchestrator):
<verify_before_proceed>
- unit_id exists
- acceptance_criteria is not empty
- implementation_files is not empty
- language is valid (go|typescript|python)
</verify_before_proceed>

```text
- unit_id: [task/subtask being tested]
- acceptance_criteria: [list of ACs to test]
- implementation_files: [files from Gate 0]
- language: [go|typescript|python]

OPTIONAL INPUT:
- coverage_threshold: [default 85.0, cannot be lower]
- gate0_handoff: [full Gate 0 output]
- existing_tests: [existing test files]

if any REQUIRED input is missing:
  → STOP and report: "Missing required input: [field]"
  → Return to orchestrator with error

if coverage_threshold < 85:
  → STOP and report: "Coverage threshold cannot be below Ring minimum (85%)"
  → Use 85% as threshold
```

## Step 2: Initialize Testing State

```text
testing_state = {
  unit_id: [from input],
  coverage_threshold: max(85, [from input]),
  coverage_actual: null,
  verdict: null,
  iterations: 0,
  max_iterations: 3,
  traceability_matrix: [],
  tests_written: 0,
  # Goroutine leak detection (Go only)
  goroutine_check: null,       # NOT_APPLICABLE | REQUIRED
  goroutine_files: 0,          # Count of files with goroutines
  goleak_coverage: null,       # "X/Y" packages with goleak
  leaks_detected: 0,           # Count of actual leaks
  goroutine_verdict: null      # PASS | NEEDS_ACTION | FAIL
}
```

## Step 3: Dispatch QA Analyst Agent

<dispatch_required agent="ring:qa-analyst">
Write unit tests for all acceptance criteria with 85%+ coverage.
</dispatch_required>

```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: "ring:qa-analyst"
  description: "Write unit tests for [unit_id]"
  prompt: |
    ⛔ WRITE UNIT TESTS for All Acceptance Criteria

    ## Input Context
    - **Unit ID:** [unit_id]
    - **Language:** [language]
    - **Coverage Threshold:** [coverage_threshold]%

    ## Acceptance Criteria to Test
    [list acceptance_criteria with AC-1, AC-2, etc.]

    ## Implementation Files to Test
    [list implementation_files]

    ## Standards Reference
    For Go: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang.md
    For TS: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/typescript.md

    Focus on: Testing Patterns section

    ## Requirements

    ### Test Coverage
    - Minimum: [coverage_threshold]% branch coverage
    - Every AC MUST have at least one test
    - Edge cases REQUIRED (null, empty, boundary, error conditions)

    ### Test Naming
    - Go: `Test{Unit}_{Method}_{Scenario}`
    - TS: `describe('{Unit}', () => { it('should {scenario}', ...) })`

    ### Test Structure
    - One behavior per test
    - Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
    - Mock all external dependencies
    - no database/API calls (unit tests only)

    ### Edge Cases Required per AC Type

    <cannot_skip>
    - Minimum 3 edge cases per AC type
    - null, empty, boundary conditions required
    - Error conditions required
    </cannot_skip>

    | AC Type | Required Edge Cases | Minimum |
    |---------|---------------------|---------|
    | Input validation | null, empty, boundary, invalid format | 3+ |
    | CRUD operations | not found, duplicate, concurrent | 3+ |
    | Business logic | zero, negative, overflow, boundary | 3+ |
    | Error handling | timeout, connection failure, retry | 2+ |

    ### Multi-Tenant Dual-Mode Testing (Go backend only)

    Every repository/service test that accesses a resource (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, S3, RabbitMQ) must verify BOTH modes. The resolvers in lib-commons v4 work transparently — the same code path handles both modes. Tests verify this contract.

    **Required pattern:** Add dual-mode sub-tests for any test that touches a resource:

    ```go
    func TestCreateAccount(t *testing.T) {
        modes := []struct {
            name         string
            multiTenant  string
        }{
            {"single-tenant", "false"},
            {"multi-tenant", "true"},
        }
        for _, mode := range modes {
            t.Run(mode.name, func(t *testing.T) {
                t.Setenv("MULTI_TENANT_ENABLED", mode.multiTenant)
                // ... same test logic, same assertions
                // Resolvers handle the connection routing transparently
            })
        }
    }
    ```

    **What to verify in multi-tenant mode:**
    - Context contains tenant ID → resolver returns tenant-specific connection
    - Context WITHOUT tenant ID → resolver returns error (not default connection)
    - Backward compat: no MULTI_TENANT_* env vars → works as single-tenant

    **What does NOT need dual-mode tests:**
    - Pure business logic (no resource access)
    - Utility/helper functions
    - Frontend/TypeScript tests

    ## Required Output Format

    ### Test Files Created
    | File | Tests | Lines |
    |------|-------|-------|
    | [path] | [count] | +N |

    ### Coverage Report
    **Command:** [coverage command]
    **Result:**
    ```
    [paste actual coverage output]
    ```

    | Package/File | Coverage |
    |--------------|----------|
    | [name] | [X%] |
    | **TOTAL** | **[X%]** |

    ### Traceability Matrix
    | AC ID | Criterion | Test File | Test Function | Status |
    |-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|--------|
    | AC-1 | [criterion text] | [file] | [function] | ✅/❌ |
    | AC-2 | [criterion text] | [file] | [function] | ✅/❌ |

    ### Quality Checks
    | Check | Status |
    |-------|--------|
    | No skipped tests | ✅/❌ |
    | No assertion-less tests | ✅/❌ |
    | Edge cases per AC | ✅/❌ |
    | Test isolation | ✅/❌ |

    ### VERDICT
    **Coverage:** [X%] vs Threshold [Y%]
    **VERDICT:** PASS / FAIL
    
    If FAIL:
    - **Gap Analysis:** [what needs more tests]
    - **Files needing coverage:** [list with line numbers]
```

## Step 3.5: Goroutine Leak Detection (Go only)

**⛔ CONDITIONAL: Only execute if `language == "go"`**

After unit tests pass, detect goroutine usage and verify goleak coverage.

See [ring:dev-goroutine-leak-testing](../dev-goroutine-leak-testing/SKILL.md) for full detection patterns and dispatch templates.
See [architecture.md](../../docs/standards/golang/architecture.md#goroutine-leak-detection-mandatory) for goleak standards.

### Detection Logic

```text
if language != "go":
  → Skip to Step 4

# Detect goroutine patterns: "go func(", "go methodCall("
if no goroutine patterns found:
  → testing_state.goroutine_check = "NOT_APPLICABLE"
  → Skip to Step 4

# Goroutines detected
→ testing_state.goroutine_check = "REQUIRED"
→ Dispatch ring:qa-analyst with test_mode="goroutine-leak"
```

### Dispatch

<dispatch_required agent="ring:qa-analyst" test_mode="goroutine-leak">
MUST dispatch with test_mode="goroutine-leak" to detect leaks and verify goleak coverage.
</dispatch_required>

### Parse Output and Handle Verdict

| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| PASS | Proceed to Step 4 |
| NEEDS_ACTION | Dispatch `ring:backend-engineer-golang` to add goleak tests, re-run |
| FAIL | Dispatch `ring:backend-engineer-golang` to fix leaks, re-run |

---

## Step 4: Parse QA Analyst Output

```text
Parse agent output:

1. Extract coverage percentage from Coverage Report
2. Extract traceability matrix
3. Extract verdict

testing_state.coverage_actual = [extracted coverage]
testing_state.traceability_matrix = [extracted matrix]
testing_state.tests_written = [count from Test Files Created]

if verdict == "PASS" and coverage_actual >= coverage_threshold:
  → testing_state.verdict = "PASS"
  → Proceed to Step 6

if verdict == "FAIL" or coverage_actual < coverage_threshold:
  → testing_state.verdict = "FAIL"
  → testing_state.iterations += 1
  → if iterations >= max_iterations: Go to Step 7 (Escalate)
  → Go to Step 5 (Dispatch Fix)
```

## Step 5: Dispatch Fix to Implementation Agent

**Coverage below threshold → Return to Gate 0 for more tests**

```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: "[implementation_agent from Gate 0]"  # e.g., "ring:backend-engineer-golang"
  description: "Add tests to meet coverage threshold for [unit_id]"
  prompt: |
    ⛔ COVERAGE BELOW THRESHOLD - Add More Tests

    ## Current Status
    - **Coverage Actual:** [coverage_actual]%
    - **Coverage Threshold:** [coverage_threshold]%
    - **Gap:** [threshold - actual]%
    - **Iteration:** [iterations] of [max_iterations]

    ## Gap Analysis (from QA)
    [paste gap analysis from QA output]

    ## Files Needing Coverage
    [paste files list from QA output]

    ## Requirements
    1. Add tests to cover the identified gaps
    2. Focus on edge cases and error paths
    3. Run coverage after each addition
    4. Stop when coverage >= [threshold]%

    ## Required Output
    - Tests added: [list]
    - New coverage: [X%]
    - Coverage command output
```

After fix → Go back to Step 3 (Re-dispatch QA Analyst)

## Step 6: Prepare Success Output

```text
Generate skill output:

## Testing Summary
**Status:** PASS
**Unit ID:** [unit_id]
**Iterations:** [testing_state.iterations]

## Coverage Report
**Threshold:** [coverage_threshold]%
**Actual:** [coverage_actual]%
**Status:** ✅ PASS

| Package/File | Coverage |
|--------------|----------|
[from QA output]
| **TOTAL** | **[coverage_actual]%** |

## Traceability Matrix
| AC ID | Criterion | Test | Status |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|
[from testing_state.traceability_matrix]

**Criteria Covered:** [X]/[Y] (100%)

## Quality Checks
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Coverage ≥ threshold | ✅ |
| All ACs tested | ✅ |
| No skipped tests | ✅ |
| Edge cases present | ✅ |
| Goroutine leak check (Go only) | [✅/N/A] |

## Goroutine Leak Report (Go only)
[If language == "go" and goroutines detected]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Goroutines detected | [count] |
| Packages with goleak | [X]/[Y] |
| Leaks found | 0 |
| Status | ✅ PASS |

[If language != "go" or no goroutines: "N/A - No goroutines detected"]

## Handoff to Next Gate
- Testing status: COMPLETE
- Coverage: [coverage_actual]% (threshold: [coverage_threshold]%)
- All criteria tested: ✅
- Ready for Gate 4 (Review): YES
```

## Step 7: Escalate - Max Iterations Reached

```text
Generate skill output:

## Testing Summary
**Status:** FAIL
**Unit ID:** [unit_id]
**Iterations:** [max_iterations] (MAX REACHED)

## Coverage Report
**Threshold:** [coverage_threshold]%
**Actual:** [coverage_actual]%
**Gap:** [threshold - actual]%
**Status:** ❌ FAIL

## Gap Analysis
[from last QA output]

## Files Still Needing Coverage
[from last QA output]

## Handoff to Next Gate
- Testing status: FAILED
- Ready for Gate 4: no
- **Action Required:** User must manually add tests or adjust scope

⛔ ESCALATION: Max iterations (3) reached. Coverage still below threshold.
User intervention required.
```

## Severity Calibration

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Test infrastructure broken, no coverage possible | Test framework failure, build broken |
| **HIGH** | Coverage below threshold, missing AC tests | 84% coverage (below 85%), untested acceptance criteria |
| **MEDIUM** | Test quality issues, edge case gaps | Missing edge case tests, poor assertion messages |
| **LOW** | Test naming, documentation gaps | Non-standard test names, missing test descriptions |

Report all severities. CRITICAL/HIGH = immediate fix. MEDIUM = fix in iteration. LOW = document for follow-up.

---

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

| User Says | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "84% is close enough" | "85% is minimum threshold. 84% = FAIL. Adding more tests." |
| "Manual testing covers it" | "Gate 3 requires executable unit tests. Dispatching QA analyst." |
| "Skip testing, deadline" | "Testing is MANDATORY. Untested code = unverified claims." |

---

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Gate 3-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Tool shows 83% but real is 90%" | Tool output IS real. Your belief is not. | **Fix issue, re-measure** |
| "Excluding dead code gets us to 85%" | Delete dead code, don't exclude it. | **Delete dead code** |
| "84.5% rounds to 85%" | Rounding is not allowed. 84.5% < 85%. | **Write more tests** |
| "Close enough with all AC tested" | "Close enough" is not passing. | **Meet exact threshold** |
| "Integration tests cover this" | Gate 3 = unit tests only. Different scope. | **Write unit tests** |

## Unit Test vs Integration Test

| Type | Characteristics | Gate 3? |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Unit** ✅ | Mocks all external deps, tests single function | YES |
| **Integration** ❌ | Hits real database/API/filesystem | no |

---
