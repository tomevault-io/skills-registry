# Dev Validation (Gate 5)

## Overview

Final validation gate requiring explicit user approval. Present evidence that each acceptance criterion is met and obtain APPROVED or REJECTED decision.

**Core principle:** Passing tests and code review DO NOT guarantee requirements are met. User validation confirms implementation matches intent.

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

**Gate 5-specific note:** User MUST respond with "APPROVED" or "REJECTED: [reason]". No other responses accepted. Silence ≠ approval.

## Self-Approval Prohibition

<forbidden>
- Same agent approving code it implemented
- Role switching to self-approve (e.g., ring:backend-engineer → ring:code-reviewer)
- Interpreting silence as approval
- Proceeding without explicit APPROVED/REJECTED
</forbidden>

**HARD GATE:** The agent that implemented code CANNOT approve validation for that same code.

| Scenario | Allowed? | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Different agent/human approves | YES | Proceed with approval |
| Same agent self-approves | no | STOP - requires external approval |
| User explicitly approves | YES | User approval always valid |

**If you implemented the code, you CANNOT approve it. Wait for user or different reviewer.**

**Important:** "Different agent" means different human/entity. The same human using different agent roles (ring:backend-engineer-* → ring:code-reviewer) is STILL self-approval and PROHIBITED.

See [CLAUDE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/CLAUDE.md) for the canonical validation policy.

## Severity Calibration

**When presenting validation results to user, issues are categorized by severity:**

| Severity | Criteria | Examples | Action Required |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **CRITICAL** | Acceptance criterion completely unmet | AC-1: "User can login" but login doesn't work at all | MUST fix before approval. Return to Gate 0. |
| **HIGH** | Acceptance criterion partially met or degraded | AC-2: "Response < 200ms" but actually 800ms | MUST fix before approval. Return to Gate 0. |
| **MEDIUM** | Edge case or non-critical requirement gap | AC-3 met for happy path, fails for empty input | SHOULD fix before approval. User decides. |
| **LOW** | Quality issue, requirement technically met | Code works but is hard to understand/maintain | MAY fix or document. User decides. |

**Severity Assignment Rules:**
- Unmet acceptance criterion = CRITICAL (requirement not satisfied)
- Degraded performance/quality vs criterion = HIGH (requirement barely met)
- Edge case failures = MEDIUM (main path works, edges don't)
- Quality/maintainability with working code = LOW (works but suboptimal)

**Why This Matters:**
- User needs to understand impact severity when deciding APPROVED vs REJECTED
- CRITICAL/HIGH = automatic REJECTED recommendation
- MEDIUM/LOW = user judgment call with context

**Example Validation Checklist with Severity:**
```markdown
## Validation Results

| AC # | Criterion | Evidence | Status | Severity |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|
| AC-1 | User can login | ✅ Tests pass, manual verification | MET | - |
| AC-2 | Response < 200ms | ⚠️ Measured 350ms average | not MET | HIGH |
| AC-3 | Input validation | ⚠️ Works for valid input, crashes on empty | PARTIAL | MEDIUM |
| AC-4 | Error messages clear | ✅ All errors have user-friendly messages | MET | - |

**Overall Validation:** REJECTED (1 HIGH issue: AC-2 response time)

**Recommendation:** Fix AC-2 (HIGH) before approval. AC-3 (MEDIUM) user can decide.
```

## Common Rationalizations - REJECTED

See [shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations (including Validation section).

**Gate 5-specific rationalizations:**

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Async over sync - work in parallel" | Validation is a GATE, not async task. STOP means STOP. |
| "Continue other tasks while waiting" | Other tasks may conflict. Validation blocks all related work. |
| "User delegated approval to X" | Delegation ≠ stakeholder approval. Only original requester can approve. |
| "I implemented it, I know requirements" | Knowledge ≠ approval authority. Implementer CANNOT self-approve. |
| "I'll switch to QA role to approve" | Role switching is STILL self-approval. PROHIBITED. |

## Red Flags - STOP

See [shared-patterns/shared-red-flags.md](../shared-patterns/shared-red-flags.md) for universal red flags (including Validation section).

If you catch yourself thinking any of those patterns, STOP immediately. Wait for explicit "APPROVED" or "REJECTED".

---

## Ambiguous Response Handling

<block_condition>
- Response is "Looks good", "Sure", "Ok", "Fine"
- Response is emoji only (👍, ✅)
- Response is "Go ahead", "Ship it"
- Response contains conditional ("APPROVED if X", "APPROVED with caveats")
</block_condition>

If any condition matches, ask for explicit APPROVED or REJECTED.

**User responses that are not valid approvals:**

| Response | Status | Action Required |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| "Looks good" | ❌ AMBIGUOUS | "To confirm, please respond with APPROVED or REJECTED: [reason]" |
| "Sure" / "Ok" / "Fine" | ❌ AMBIGUOUS | Ask for explicit APPROVED |
| "👍" / "✅" | ❌ AMBIGUOUS | Emojis are not formal approval. Ask for APPROVED. |
| "Go ahead" | ❌ AMBIGUOUS | Ask for explicit APPROVED |
| "Ship it" | ❌ AMBIGUOUS | Ask for explicit APPROVED |
| "APPROVED" | ✅ VALID | Proceed to next gate |
| "REJECTED: [reason]" | ✅ VALID | Document reason, return to Gate 0 |
| "APPROVED if X" | ❌ CONDITIONAL | Not approved until X is verified. Status = PENDING. |
| "APPROVED with caveats" | ❌ CONDITIONAL | Not approved. List caveats, verify each, then re-ask. |
| "APPROVED but fix Y later" | ❌ CONDITIONAL | Not approved. Y must be addressed first. |

**When user gives ambiguous response:**
```
"Thank you for the feedback. For formal validation, please confirm with:
- APPROVED - to proceed with completion
- REJECTED: [reason] - to return for fixes

Which is your decision?"
```

**Never interpret intent. Require explicit keyword.**

## Awaiting Approval - STOP all WORK

<cannot_skip>
- STOP all work when validation request is presented
- Wait for explicit APPROVED or REJECTED
- Do not proceed with any "quick fixes" while waiting
</cannot_skip>

**When validation request is presented:**

1. **STOP all WORK** on this feature, module, and related code
2. **DO not** proceed to documentation, refactoring, or "quick fixes"
3. **DO not** work on "unrelated" tasks in the same codebase
4. **WAIT** for explicit user response

**User unavailability is not permission to:**
- Assume approval
- Work on "low-risk" next steps
- Redefine criteria as "already met"
- Proceed with "we'll fix issues later"

**Document pending status and WAIT.**

## Approval Format - MANDATORY

<user_decision>
Valid responses:
- "APPROVED" → Proceed to next gate
- "REJECTED: [reason]" → Return for fixes
</user_decision>

**User MUST respond with exactly one of:**

✅ **"APPROVED"** - All criteria verified, proceed to next gate
✅ **"REJECTED: [specific reason]"** - Issues found, fix and revalidate

**not acceptable:**
- ❌ "Looks good" (vague)
- ❌ "👍" (ambiguous)
- ❌ Silence (not a response)
- ❌ "Approved with minor issues" (partial = REJECTED)

**If user provides ambiguous response, ask for explicit APPROVED or REJECTED.**

## Prerequisites

Before starting this gate:
- All tests pass (Gate 3 verified)
- Code review passed (Gate 4 VERDICT: PASS)
- Implementation is complete and stable

## Steps 1-4: Evidence Collection and Validation

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| **1. Gather Evidence** | Collect proof per criterion | Table: Criterion, Evidence Type (Test/Demo/Log/Manual/Metric), Location, Status |
| **2. Verify** | Execute verification (automated: `npm test --grep "AC-X"`, manual: documented steps with Result + Screenshot) | VERIFIED/FAILED per criterion |
| **3. Build Checklist** | For each AC: Status + Evidence list + Verification method | Validation Checklist |
| **4. Present Request** | Task Summary + Validation Table + Test Results + Review Summary + Artifacts | USER DECISION block with APPROVED/REJECTED options |

**Validation Request format:**
```
VALIDATION REQUEST - [TASK-ID]
Task: [title], [description], [date]
Criteria: Table (Criterion | Status | Evidence)
Tests: Total/Passed/Failed/Coverage
Review: VERDICT + issue counts
Artifacts: Code, Tests, Docs links

USER DECISION REQUIRED:
[ ] APPROVED - proceed
[ ] REJECTED - specify: which criterion, what's missing, what's wrong
```

## Steps 5-6: Handle Decision and Document

| Decision | Actions | Documentation |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **APPROVED** | 1. Document (Task, Approver, Date, Notes) → 2. Update status → 3. Proceed to feedback loop | Validation Approved record |
| **REJECTED** | 1. Document (Task, Rejector, Date, Criterion failed, Issue, Expected vs Actual) → 2. Create remediation task → 3. Return to Gate 0 → 4. After fix: restart from Gate 3 → 5. Track in feedback loop | Validation Rejected + Remediation Required records |

**Validation Record format:** Date, Validator, Decision, Criteria Summary (X/Y), Evidence Summary (tests/manual/perf), Decision Details, Next Steps

## Validation Best Practices

| Category | Strong Evidence | Weak Evidence (avoid) |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Evidence Quality** | Automated test + assertion, Screenshot/recording, Log with exact values, Metrics within threshold | "Works on my machine", "Tested manually" (no details), "Should be fine", Indirect evidence |
| **Verifiable Criteria** | "User can login" → test login + verify session | "System is fast" → needs specific metric |
| | "Page loads <2s" → measure + show metric | "UX is good" → needs measurable criteria |

## Handling Partial Validation

If some criteria pass but others fail:

1. **Do not partially approve**
2. Mark entire validation as REJECTED
3. Document which criteria passed (won't need re-verification)
4. Document which criteria failed (need fixes)
5. After fixes, re-verify only failed criteria
6. Present updated checklist for approval

## Anti-Patterns

**Never:**
- Skip validation because "tests pass"
- Auto-approve without user decision
- Assume criterion is met without evidence
- Accept vague approval ("looks good")
- Proceed while awaiting decision
- Reuse old evidence for new changes

**Always:**
- Present evidence for every criterion
- Require explicit APPROVED/REJECTED decision
- Document rejection reason in detail
- Track validation metrics
- Re-verify after any changes

## Execution Report

Base metrics per [shared-patterns/output-execution-report.md](../shared-patterns/output-execution-report.md).

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | Xm Ys |
| Criteria Validated | X/Y |
| Evidence Collected | X automated, Y manual |
| User Decision | APPROVED/REJECTED |
| Rejection Reason | [if applicable] |
| Result | Gate passed / Returned to Gate 0 |

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **User Unavailable** | Document pending → Do not proceed → Set escalation → Block task completion |
| **Criterion Ambiguity** | STOP → Ask user to clarify → Update AC → Re-verify with new understanding |
| **New Requirements** | Document as new req → Complete current validation on original AC → Create new task → no scope creep |
