# Documentation Structure

Good structure helps users find what they need quickly. Organize content by user tasks and mental models, not by internal system organization.

## Content Hierarchy

```
Documentation/
├── Welcome/              # Entry point, product overview
├── Getting Started/      # First steps, quick wins
├── Guides/              # Task-oriented documentation
│   ├── Understanding X   # Conceptual
│   ├── Use Cases        # Real-world scenarios
│   └── Best Practices   # Recommendations
├── API Reference/       # Technical reference
│   ├── Introduction     # API overview
│   └── Endpoints/       # Per-resource documentation
└── Updates/             # Changelog, versioning
```

## Page Structure Patterns

| Page Type | Structure |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Overview** | Brief description → "In this section you will find:" → Linked list of child pages |
| **Conceptual** | Lead paragraph → Key characteristics (bullets) → How it works → Subtopics with `---` dividers → Related concepts |
| **Task-Oriented** | Brief context → Prerequisites → Numbered steps → Verification → Next steps |

---

## Section Dividers

Use `---` between major sections for visual separation.

**When to use:**
- Between major topic changes
- Before "Related" or "Next steps" sections
- After introductory content
- Before prerequisites in guides

**Don't overuse:** Not every heading needs a divider.

---

## Navigation Patterns

| Pattern | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| Breadcrumb | Show hierarchy: `Guides > Core Entities > Accounts` |
| Prev/Next | Connect sequential content: `[Previous: Assets] \| [Next: Portfolios]` |
| On-this-page | For long pages, show section links at top |

---

## Information Density

**Scannable content:**
1. Lead with key point in each section
2. Use bullet points for 3+ items
3. Use tables for comparing options
4. Use headings every 2-3 paragraphs
5. Bold key terms on first use

**Progressive disclosure:**
- Essential info (80% of users need) first
- Advanced configuration in separate section
- Edge cases and rare scenarios last

---

## Tables vs Lists

**Use tables when:** Comparing items across same attributes, showing structured data (API fields), displaying options with consistent properties

**Use lists when:** Items don't have comparable attributes, sequence matters (steps), items have varying detail levels

---

## Code Examples Placement

| Type | When |
|------|------|
| Inline code | Short references: "Set the `assetCode` field..." |
| Code blocks | Complete, runnable examples |

**Rules:**
1. Show example immediately after explaining it
2. Keep examples minimal but complete
3. Use realistic data (not "foo", "bar")
4. Show both request and response for API docs

---

## Cross-Linking Strategy

- **Link first mention** of a concept in each section
- **Don't over-link** – once per section is enough
- **Link destinations:** Concept → conceptual docs, API action → endpoint, "Learn more" → deeper dive

---

## Page Length Guidelines

| Page Type | Target | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Overview | 1-2 screens | Quick orientation |
| Concept | 2-4 screens | Thorough explanation |
| How-to | 1-3 screens | Task completion |
| API endpoint | 2-3 screens | Complete reference |
| Best practices | 3-5 screens | Multiple recommendations |

If >5 screens, consider splitting.

---

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Content organized by user task, not system structure
- [ ] Overview pages link to all child content
- [ ] Section dividers separate major topics
- [ ] Headings create scannable structure
- [ ] Tables used for comparable items
- [ ] Code examples follow explanations
- [ ] Cross-links connect related content
- [ ] Page length appropriate for type
- [ ] Navigation connects sequential content

---

## Standards Loading (MANDATORY)

Before planning documentation structure:

1. **Understand content types** - What documents will exist (conceptual, how-to, API reference)
2. **Load writing skills** - `ring:writing-functional-docs` and `ring:writing-api-docs`
3. **Review existing structure** - Understand current documentation hierarchy

**HARD GATE:** CANNOT reorganize documentation without understanding content and audience.

---

## Blocker Criteria - STOP and Report

| Condition | Decision | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Content inventory incomplete | STOP | Report: "Need complete list of documentation topics" |
| User tasks undefined | STOP | Report: "Need user task list to organize around" |
| Information architecture undefined | STOP | Report: "Need IA decisions before structuring" |
| Navigation requirements unclear | STOP | Report: "Need navigation pattern decisions" |

### Cannot Be Overridden

These requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE:

- MUST organize by user tasks (not system structure)
- MUST include overview pages that link to children
- MUST use section dividers (`---`) between major topics
- MUST keep page length appropriate for document type
- CANNOT nest deeper than H3 without good reason
- CANNOT create orphan pages (must be linked)

---

## Severity Calibration

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Completely disorganized, no navigation | No hierarchy, orphan pages everywhere |
| **HIGH** | Organized by system, not user tasks | "Database tables" instead of "Managing accounts" |
| **MEDIUM** | Missing links, poor scannability | No cross-links, walls of text |
| **LOW** | Structure works but could be optimized | Could improve navigation, add dividers |

---

## Pressure Resistance

| User Says | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Organize by our system components" | "MUST organize by user tasks. System structure ≠ mental model. I'll structure around what users do." |
| "One long page is fine" | "Long pages overwhelm users. MUST split by document type guidelines. I'll organize appropriately." |
| "Skip the overview pages" | "Overview pages are REQUIRED for navigation. I'll create overview pages linking to children." |
| "Cross-links are extra work" | "Cross-links enable discovery. MUST connect related content. I'll add appropriate links." |
| "Flat structure is simpler" | "Flat structure makes finding content harder. MUST use appropriate hierarchy." |

---

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Mirrors our codebase structure" | Users don't know your codebase | **MUST organize by user tasks** |
| "Everything on one page is convenient" | Convenience for whom? Not users | **Split per page length guidelines** |
| "Deep nesting shows thoroughness" | Deep nesting hides content | **Keep hierarchy shallow (H3 max)** |
| "Users will search anyway" | Search supplements, not replaces structure | **MUST provide clear navigation** |
| "Links can be added later" | Orphan pages are lost pages | **Add links during creation** |
| "Structure is aesthetic, not functional" | Structure IS functionality | **Structure enables findability** |

---

## When This Skill is Not Needed

Signs that documentation structure is already correct:

- Content organized around user tasks and goals
- Clear hierarchy with appropriate depth
- Overview pages link to all child content
- Section dividers separate major topics
- Navigation connects sequential content
- Cross-links connect related topics
- Page lengths appropriate for document type
- No orphan pages

**If all above are true:** Structure is correct, no reorganization needed.
