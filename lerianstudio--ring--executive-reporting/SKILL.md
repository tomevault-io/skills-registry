## Purpose

This skill provides a framework for:
- Executive status summaries
- Portfolio dashboards

---

## Executive Communication Principles

### The Executive Pyramid

| Level | Content | Time |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Summary** | Key message in one sentence | 10 seconds |
| **Overview** | 3-5 key points | 1 minute |
| **Detail** | Supporting data and analysis | 5 minutes |
| **Appendix** | Full data for reference | As needed |

### What Executives Want

| They Want | They Don't Want |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Clear status (RAG) | Ambiguous status |
| Actionable insights | Information dumps |
| Decisions required | Problems without options |
| Trends and patterns | Raw data |
| Risks and mitigations | Surprises |
| Confidence in team | Excuses |

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Executive Reporting-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Bad news can wait" | Delayed bad news = worse news. Executives need truth. | **Report immediately with context** |
| "Too much detail for executives" | Under-reporting creates blind spots. | **Provide right level of detail** |
| "Green because no complaints" | Silence ≠ health. Verify with data. | **Evidence-based status only** |
| "They'll ask if they want to know" | Proactive communication builds trust. | **Anticipate needs, don't wait** |
| "Keep it positive" | False positivity destroys credibility. | **Report reality with solutions** |

---

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

### Executive Reporting-Specific Pressures

| Pressure Type | Request | Agent Response |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| "Make the status green" | "Status must reflect reality. I'll provide accurate status with context and recovery plan." |
| "Don't mention that risk" | "Executives expect full picture. Including with mitigation status." |
| "Simplify it, they won't understand" | "Executives understand complexity. Will provide clear summary with detail available." |
| "We need this in 30 minutes" | "Quality over speed for executive comms. Will provide accurate summary in timeframe, full detail to follow." |

---

## Blocker Criteria - STOP and Report

**ALWAYS pause and report blocker for:**

| Situation | Required Action |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Data integrity questionable | STOP. Cannot report unreliable data. Verify before reporting. |
| PM disputes project status | STOP. Resolve disagreement before publishing. |
| Asked to misrepresent status | STOP. Cannot compromise integrity. Escalate if pressured. |
| Critical escalation discovered | STOP. Immediate verbal communication before written report. |

### Cannot Be Overridden

**The following requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

| Requirement | Cannot Override Because |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Accurate status reporting** | False status destroys credibility with executives |
| **Complete risk disclosure** | Hidden risks become board-level surprises |
| **Data verification** | Unverified data misleads executive decisions |
| **Clear decision requests** | Vague asks don't get executive decisions |
| **Balanced presentation** | Spin erodes trust and credibility |

**If user insists on violating these:**
1. Escalate to orchestrator
2. Do NOT publish inaccurate report
3. Document the request and your refusal

---

## Severity Calibration

When determining what to escalate in executive reports:

| Severity | Criteria | Executive Action Required |
|----------|----------|---------------------------|
| **CRITICAL** | Business viability impacted, material risk | Immediate attention, decision this meeting |
| **HIGH** | Significant objective impact, recovery needed | Decision needed this week, intervention may be required |
| **MEDIUM** | Notable but manageable deviation | Awareness, monitor, may need decision next cycle |
| **LOW** | Minor variance within tolerance | FYI only, included for completeness |

**Escalate CRITICAL and HIGH. Report MEDIUM for awareness. Include LOW for transparency.**

## When Executive Report Is Not Needed

<MANDATORY>
MUST: Report is minimal only when ALL conditions are met:
</MANDATORY>

| Condition | Verification |
|-----------|-------------|
| No active portfolio projects | Verify no projects in tracking |
| Routine status unchanged | No new risks, milestones, or blockers since last report |
| Stakeholders explicitly waived | Written confirmation required |
| Recent report covers same period | Reference recent report that applies |

**MUST: Full executive report REQUIRED for the following conditions:**

| Condition | Why Required |
|-----------|-------------|
| Any project status change | Stakeholders need current information |
| New risks identified | Risk visibility is NON-NEGOTIABLE for executives |
| Milestone reached or missed | Progress tracking required for governance |
| Resource or budget conflicts | Decision-making requires current data |
| Board or sponsor meeting | Cannot attend unprepared |

**MUST: When in doubt, produce the report. Incomplete executive reporting causes misaligned decisions and erodes trust.**
