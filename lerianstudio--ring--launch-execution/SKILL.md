# Launch Execution

Launch coordination including checklists, stakeholder alignment, and day-of execution management.

## Purpose

Launch execution ensures smooth transition from planning to market:
- Coordinates all stakeholders and dependencies
- Manages pre-launch checklist completion
- Orchestrates day-of activities
- Establishes post-launch monitoring

**HARD GATE:** GTM plan MUST be completed before launch execution.

## Process

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Gate-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "We can skip the checklist" | Skipped items cause launch failures | **Complete every checklist item** |
| "Everyone knows their role" | Assumptions cause coordination failures | **Document RACI explicitly** |
| "We'll handle issues as they come" | Reactive handling causes escalation | **Pre-define escalation paths** |
| "Rollback won't be needed" | Every launch needs rollback plan | **Document rollback triggers** |

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

### Gate-Specific Pressures

| Pressure Type | Request | Agent Response |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| "Launch with checklist gaps" | "We can fix it post-launch" | "Gaps cause launch failures. Completing checklist or delaying." |
| "Skip the war room" | "It's overkill for this launch" | "War room enables rapid response. Setting up coordination." |
| "We don't need rollback" | "We tested thoroughly" | "Testing ≠ zero issues. Documenting rollback plan." |

## Execution Report

Base metrics per [shared-patterns/execution-report.md](../shared-patterns/execution-report.md):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | Xm Ys |
| Iterations | N |
| Result | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL |

### Gate-Specific Details
