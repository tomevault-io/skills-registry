  }
}
```

### Provisioning Verification

```bash
# Verify namespace
kubectl get namespace [service-name]

# Verify compute
kubectl get deployment -n [service-name]

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Skip documentation, code is self-explanatory" | On-call != developers | **Complete runbook** |
| "We'll add observability later" | Blind deployments = incidents | **Observability on day 1** |
| "Golden path doesn't fit exactly" | Customizations add complexity | **Justify every deviation** |
| "Security can come later" | Later = never for security | **Security from start** |
| "Team can figure it out" | Assumptions cause outages | **Complete handoff process** |

---

## Dispatch Specialist

For platform onboarding tasks, dispatch:

```
