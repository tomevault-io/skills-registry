# PMO Retrospective Skill

Systematic capture and application of lessons learned at portfolio level.

## Purpose

This skill provides a framework for:
- Lessons learned capture
- Pattern identification
- Process improvement
- Organizational learning
- Knowledge transfer

---

## Retrospective Types

### Type 1: Project Closure Retrospective

**Trigger:** Project completion or termination
**Scope:** Single project
**Participants:** Project team, sponsor, key stakeholders

---

### Type 2: Portfolio Period Review

**Trigger:** Quarterly or annual review
**Scope:** All projects in period
**Participants:** PMO, project managers, executives

---

### Type 3: Thematic Retrospective

**Trigger:** Recurring pattern observed
**Scope:** Projects sharing the pattern
**Participants:** Affected project managers, PMO, subject matter experts

---

## Retrospective Gates

### Gate 1: Context Setting

**Objective:** Establish retrospective scope and participants

**Actions:**
1. Define retrospective type and scope
2. Identify participants
3. Gather project data
4. Schedule sessions

**Context Template:**

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Type | Project/Portfolio/Thematic |
| Scope | [Projects/Period] |
| Participants | [List] |
| Data Sources | [List] |

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/retro-context.md`

---

### Gate 2: Data Collection

**Objective:** Gather objective data about performance

**Actions:**
1. Collect final project metrics
2. Gather variance explanations
3. Document scope changes
4. Compile risk/issue history

**Data Points:**

| Category | Data |
|----------|------|
| Schedule | Planned vs actual duration |
| Cost | Budget vs actual spend |
| Scope | Baseline vs final scope |
| Quality | Defects, rework |
| Risks | Risks that materialized |
| Changes | Number and impact |

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/retro-data.md`

---

### Gate 3: Reflection

**Objective:** Identify what worked, what didn't, and why

**Actions:**
1. Conduct retrospective session
2. Identify successes to repeat
3. Identify failures to prevent
4. Analyze root causes

**Reflection Framework:**

| Category | Question |
|----------|----------|
| **What went well?** | What should we keep doing? |
| **What didn't go well?** | What should we stop doing? |
| **What was confusing?** | What needs clarification? |
| **What was missing?** | What should we start doing? |
| **What surprised us?** | What assumptions were wrong? |

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/retro-reflection.md`

---

### Gate 4: Pattern Analysis

**Objective:** Identify patterns across projects/time

**Actions:**
1. Compare with previous retrospectives
2. Identify recurring themes
3. Assess systemic vs isolated issues
4. Prioritize improvement areas

**Pattern Types:**

| Type | Indicator | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Systemic** | Same issue in 3+ projects | Process change required |
| **Capability** | Same team struggle repeating | Training/hiring needed |
| **Tool** | Tool-related friction | Tool improvement/replacement |
| **Communication** | Stakeholder issues recurring | Communication improvement |
| **Estimation** | Consistent over/under estimation | Estimation process improvement |

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/retro-patterns.md`

---

### Gate 5: Action Planning

**Objective:** Create actionable improvement plan

**Actions:**
1. Define specific improvements
2. Assign owners
3. Set timelines
4. Define success criteria

**Action Template:**

| Improvement | Owner | Timeline | Success Criteria | Status |
|-------------|-------|----------|------------------|--------|
| [Improvement] | [Owner] | [Date] | [Criteria] | [Status] |

**Priority Framework:**

| Impact / Effort | Low Effort | High Effort |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **High Impact** | Do First | Plan Carefully |
| **Low Impact** | Quick Wins | Don't Do |

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/retro-actions.md`

---

### Gate 6: Knowledge Sharing

**Objective:** Distribute lessons to organization

**Actions:**
1. Document lessons learned
2. Update PMO knowledge base
3. Present to relevant teams
4. Update templates/processes

**Knowledge Sharing Channels:**

| Channel | Audience | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| PMO Wiki | All PMs | Full lessons |
| Newsletter | Organization | Summary |
| Training | New PMs | Incorporated |
| Templates | All projects | Updated |
| Playbooks | Specific scenarios | Detailed guidance |

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/lessons-learned.md`

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Retrospective-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "We're too busy for retrospectives" | Learning gaps cost more than retrospective time. | **Schedule and conduct retrospective** |
| "We know what went wrong" | Assumptions miss root causes. | **Formal analysis required** |
| "It was a unique situation" | Patterns hide in "unique" situations. | **Document and compare** |
| "People will be defensive" | Blame-free culture enables learning. | **Focus on process, not people** |
| "Lessons will be ignored anyway" | Track action completion to ensure learning. | **Follow up on actions** |

---

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

### Retrospective-Specific Pressures

| Pressure Type | Request | Agent Response |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| "Skip retro, team already on next project" | "Learning before moving on prevents repeating mistakes. Conducting abbreviated retrospective." |
| "Don't document that failure" | "Failures are learning opportunities. Documenting with constructive framing." |
| "Just move on, it's in the past" | "Past informs future. Retrospective protects future projects." |

---

## Blocker Criteria - STOP and Report

**ALWAYS pause and report blocker for:**

| Situation | Required Action |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Key participants unavailable | STOP. Incomplete retrospective misses perspectives. Reschedule. |
| Data unavailable | STOP. Data-free retrospective is opinion session. Get data. |
| Blame culture emerging | STOP. Reset to blameless framework. Not about individuals. |
| No action ownership | STOP. Lessons without owners become forgotten. Assign owners. |

### Cannot Be Overridden

**The following requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

| Requirement | Cannot Override Because |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Blameless approach** | Blame prevents learning. Fear prevents honesty. |
| **Action owner assignment** | Unowned actions are never completed. |
| **Data-driven analysis** | Opinions without data lead to wrong conclusions. |
| **Participant inclusion** | Missing perspectives create incomplete learning. |
| **Follow-up tracking** | Lessons without follow-up are forgotten. |

**If user insists on violating these:**
1. Escalate to orchestrator
2. Do NOT proceed with incomplete retrospective
3. Document the request and your refusal

---

## Severity Calibration

When assessing retrospective findings:

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Systemic issue affecting multiple projects | Process failure causing 3+ project delays, compliance violation pattern |
| **HIGH** | Significant recurring problem | Same estimation error in 2+ projects, repeated resource conflicts |
| **MEDIUM** | Notable improvement opportunity | Communication gaps, tool friction, documentation quality |
| **LOW** | Minor optimization | Template improvements, minor process tweaks |

**Document ALL severities. Prioritize action on CRITICAL and HIGH.**

## When Retrospective Is Not Needed

<MANDATORY>
MUST: Retrospective is minimal only when ALL conditions are met:
</MANDATORY>

| Condition | Verification |
|-----------|-------------|
| Project was trivial (<1 week, <3 people) | Verify scope and team size |
| No significant issues occurred | Confirm no deviations from plan |
| Team explicitly requested skip | Written confirmation required |
| Previous recent retrospective covers patterns | Reference recent retro that applies |

**MUST: Full retrospective REQUIRED for the following conditions:**

| Condition | Why Required |
|-----------|-------------|
| Any project completion | Learning opportunity, even for successful projects |
| Any project termination | Understanding failure prevents repetition |
| Significant budget/schedule variance | Root cause analysis prevents recurrence |
| Team or stakeholder conflicts | Relationship and process lessons critical |
| Process improvement identified | Must capture and act on improvement |

**MUST: When in doubt, conduct the retrospective. Skipped retrospectives become repeated failures.**
