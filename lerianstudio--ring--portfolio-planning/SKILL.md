# Portfolio Planning Skill

Strategic portfolio planning for multi-project coordination and optimization.

## Purpose

This skill provides a systematic approach to:
- Assess current portfolio health
- Evaluate strategic alignment
- Plan portfolio composition
- Optimize resource allocation across projects
- Balance risk across portfolio

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting portfolio planning, ensure:

| Prerequisite | Required For | Source |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Project list | Portfolio scope | Project registry |
| Strategic objectives | Alignment scoring | Strategy documents |
| Resource availability | Capacity planning | Resource planner |
| Budget constraints | Financial planning | Finance team |

## Portfolio Planning Gates

### Gate 1: Portfolio Inventory

**Objective:** Create complete picture of current portfolio

**Actions:**
1. List all active projects
2. Capture status of each project
3. Document resource allocations
4. Identify dependencies

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/portfolio-inventory.md`

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All active projects listed
- [ ] Status captured (Green/Yellow/Red)
- [ ] Resources identified per project
- [ ] Dependencies documented

---

### Gate 2: Strategic Alignment Assessment

**Objective:** Evaluate how each project aligns with strategic objectives

**Actions:**
1. Map projects to strategic objectives
2. Score alignment (1-5 scale)
3. Identify orphan projects (no strategic link)
4. Flag misaligned projects

**Alignment Scoring:**

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Directly enables strategic objective |
| 4 | Strongly supports strategic objective |
| 3 | Moderately supports strategy |
| 2 | Weak strategic connection |
| 1 | No clear strategic value |

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/strategic-alignment.md`

---

### Gate 3: Capacity Assessment

**Objective:** Understand portfolio capacity constraints

**Actions:**
1. Aggregate resource demand across projects
2. Compare to available capacity
3. Identify over/under allocation
4. Document skill gaps

**Dispatch:** `resource-planner` for detailed analysis

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/capacity-assessment.md`

---

### Gate 4: Risk Portfolio View

**Objective:** Aggregate and correlate risks across portfolio

**Actions:**
1. Collect project-level risks
2. Identify correlated risks
3. Assess portfolio risk exposure
4. Plan portfolio-level mitigations

**Dispatch:** `risk-analyst` for detailed analysis

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/portfolio-risks.md`

---

### Gate 5: Portfolio Optimization

**Objective:** Recommend portfolio changes for optimal value delivery

**Actions:**
1. Analyze portfolio balance (run/grow/transform)
2. Identify optimization opportunities
3. Recommend project prioritization
4. Propose resource reallocation

**Optimization Criteria:**

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Strategic value | 30% | Alignment with objectives |
| Resource efficiency | 25% | Resource utilization optimization |
| Risk balance | 20% | Portfolio risk distribution |
| Dependencies | 15% | Dependency health |
| Timeline | 10% | Schedule alignment |

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/portfolio-recommendations.md`

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Portfolio-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "We know our portfolio well" | Familiarity breeds blind spots. Fresh analysis required. | **Complete full inventory** |
| "All projects are strategic" | If everything is strategic, nothing is. Differentiation required. | **Score alignment objectively** |
| "Capacity is fine, teams said so" | Self-reported capacity often optimistic. Validation required. | **Verify with utilization data** |
| "Risk aggregation is overkill" | Portfolio risk > sum of project risks. Correlation matters. | **Aggregate and correlate risks** |

---

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

### Portfolio-Specific Pressures

| Pressure Type | Request | Agent Response |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| "Just add this project, it's approved" | "Approval ≠ capacity. Portfolio impact assessment required before adding." |
| "Don't question the strategic projects" | "All projects require alignment verification. No exemptions for labeled 'strategic' projects." |
| "We don't have time for full planning" | "Incomplete planning causes downstream delays. Completing full planning cycle." |

---

## Blocker Criteria - STOP and Report

**ALWAYS pause and report blocker for:**

| Situation | Required Action |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Portfolio capacity exceeded by >20% | STOP. Report overload. Wait for prioritization decision. |
| Strategic objectives unclear | STOP. Cannot score alignment. Request strategy clarification. |
| Resource data unavailable | STOP. Cannot assess capacity. Request resource information. |
| Multiple high-risk projects correlated | STOP. Report compound risk. Wait for risk mitigation decision. |

### Cannot Be Overridden

**The following requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

| Requirement | Cannot Override Because |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Complete portfolio inventory** | Hidden projects distort capacity and priority |
| **Strategic alignment scoring** | Unscored projects cannot be prioritized |
| **Capacity validation** | Assumed capacity leads to overcommitment |
| **Risk aggregation** | Portfolio risk > sum of project risks |
| **Stakeholder input** | Decisions without stakeholder input fail adoption |

**If user insists on violating these:**
1. Escalate to orchestrator
2. Do NOT proceed with incomplete planning
3. Document the request and your refusal

---

## Severity Calibration

When assessing portfolio issues:

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Portfolio viability at risk | >50% projects red, capacity exceeded by >30%, strategic misalignment |
| **HIGH** | Significant portfolio impact | Multiple correlated risks, key project failing, major resource gaps |
| **MEDIUM** | Optimization needed | Imbalanced portfolio, moderate resource pressure, minor misalignment |
| **LOW** | Minor improvements possible | Process refinements, template improvements, minor optimization |

**Report ALL severities. Escalate CRITICAL immediately. Address HIGH this week.**

## When Portfolio Planning Is Not Needed

<MANDATORY>
MUST: Portfolio planning is minimal only when ALL conditions are met:
</MANDATORY>

| Condition | Verification |
|-----------|-------------|
| Recent planning exists (<30 days) | Reference existing portfolio plan |
| No new projects proposed | Verify no intake requests pending |
| No significant changes | Confirm no budget/resource/strategy changes |
| All projects on track (Green) | Verify no Yellow/Red status |

**MUST: Full portfolio planning REQUIRED for the following conditions:**

| Condition | Why Required |
|-----------|-------------|
| New project intake request | Must assess impact on portfolio |
| Quarterly/annual planning cycle | Regular planning cadence required |
| Strategic objectives changed | Alignment must be re-assessed |
| Resource constraints identified | Prioritization decisions needed |
| Multiple projects Yellow/Red | Intervention and rebalancing required |

**MUST: When in doubt, refresh the portfolio plan. Stale portfolio plans cause misaligned investments.**
