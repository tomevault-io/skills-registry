# Pricing Strategy

Comprehensive pricing analysis including pricing models, competitive analysis, and recommendations.

## Purpose

Pricing strategy determines how you capture value:
- Pricing model aligns with customer value perception
- Competitive pricing informs positioning
- Willingness to pay determines price ceiling
- Cost structure determines price floor

**HARD GATE:** Market analysis SHOULD be completed before pricing strategy for context.

## Process

### Phase 1: Pricing Context

Understand the pricing landscape:

```markdown
## Pricing Context

### Product/Feature Overview
**Product:** [Name]
**Value Proposition:** [Primary value prop]
**Target Segment:** [From market analysis]
**Competitive Category:** [From positioning]

### Current State (if applicable)
**Current Pricing:** [Existing pricing if updating]
**Current Revenue:** [Baseline]
**Current Conversion:** [Rate]
**Known Issues:** [Pain points with current pricing]

### Pricing Objectives
| Objective | Priority | Target |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Revenue maximization | HIGH/MED/LOW | [Target] |
| Market penetration | HIGH/MED/LOW | [Target] |
| Competitive positioning | HIGH/MED/LOW | [Target] |
| Customer acquisition | HIGH/MED/LOW | [Target] |
| Margin optimization | HIGH/MED/LOW | [Target] |
```

### Phase 2: Pricing Model Analysis

Evaluate pricing model options:

```markdown
## Pricing Model Analysis

### Model Evaluation
| Model | Fit | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |

```

### Phase 3: Competitive Pricing Analysis

Analyze competitor pricing:

```markdown
## Competitive Pricing Analysis

### Price Positioning
**Market Range:** $X - $Y
**Average Price:** $X
**Premium Tier:** $X+
**Budget Tier:** <$X

### Positioning Decision
| Strategy | Price Point | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Premium | Above market | [When appropriate] |
| Value | At market | [When appropriate] |
| Penetration | Below market | [When appropriate] |

**RECOMMENDATION:** [Strategy with rationale]

### Feature-Value Comparison
| Feature | Our Price | Comp A | Comp B | Value Gap |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| [Feature 1] | $X | $Y | $Z | [Over/Under] |
| [Feature 2] | $X | $Y | $Z | [Over/Under] |
```

### Phase 4: Value-Based Pricing

Determine willingness to pay:

```markdown
## Value-Based Pricing

### Value Drivers
| Value Driver | Customer Impact | Quantification |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| [Time saved] | [Hours/week] | [$X value] |
| [Cost reduced] | [% reduction] | [$X value] |
| [Revenue enabled] | [% increase] | [$X value] |

### Total Value Delivered
**Quantified Value:** $X per [time period]
**Value Capture Ratio:** X% (price / value delivered)
**Price Justification:** [How price relates to value]

### Willingness to Pay Research
**Method:** [Survey, interviews, conjoint analysis, Van Westendorp]
**Sample Size:** N
**Key Findings:**
- Price too cheap: $X
- Acceptable range: $X - $Y
- Price too expensive: $Y
- Maximum willingness: $Z

### Segment Pricing Sensitivity
| Segment | Price Sensitivity | Recommended Price |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [Segment 1] | HIGH/MED/LOW | $X |
| [Segment 2] | HIGH/MED/LOW | $X |
| [Segment 3] | HIGH/MED/LOW | $X |
```

### Phase 5: Pricing Recommendation

Synthesize into recommendation:

```markdown
## Pricing Recommendation

### Recommended Pricing
| Tier | Price | Billing | Features | Target |
|------|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| Free | $0 | N/A | [List] | [Segment] |
| Starter | $X/mo | Monthly/Annual | [List] | [Segment] |
| Pro | $X/mo | Monthly/Annual | [List] | [Segment] |
| Enterprise | Custom | Annual | [List] | [Segment] |

### Annual Discount
**Discount:** X%
**Rationale:** [Why this discount]

### Price Anchoring
**Anchor Price:** $X (Highest visible tier)
**Target Tier:** [Most recommended tier]
**Value Demonstration:** [How to show value]

### Revenue Projection
| Scenario | Assumptions | Year 1 Revenue |

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Gate-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Match competitor pricing" | Competitor pricing serves their strategy, not yours | **Develop independent pricing based on your value** |
| "Lower price wins" | Race to bottom destroys value. Differentiate instead. | **Price based on value, not fear** |
| "We'll figure it out later" | Wrong pricing at launch damages brand and revenue | **Validate before launch** |
| "Pricing is just numbers" | Pricing communicates value. It's strategic. | **Treat as strategic decision** |

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

### Gate-Specific Pressures

| Pressure Type | Request | Agent Response |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| "Just undercut competitors" | "Price 20% below market" | "Undercutting signals low value. Pricing based on differentiation." |
| "Make it free to grow" | "Free tier will drive adoption" | "Free can work but requires strategy. Analyzing freemium viability." |
| "Don't worry about margins" | "Growth first, margins later" | "Unsustainable pricing kills companies. Ensuring viable margins." |
