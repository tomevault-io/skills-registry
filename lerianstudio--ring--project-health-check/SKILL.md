---

## Health Check Dimensions

### Dimension 1: Schedule Health

**Metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Green | Yellow | Red |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|-----|
| SPI | EV / PV | >= 0.95 | 0.85-0.94 | < 0.85 |
| Schedule Variance | EV - PV | >= 0 | -5% to 0 | < -5% |
| Milestone Status | On-time % | >= 90% | 70-89% | < 70% |

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is the project on schedule?
- Are milestones being met?
- What is causing any delays?
- Is the critical path protected?

---

### Dimension 2: Cost Health

**Metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Green | Yellow | Red |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|-----|
| CPI | EV / AC | >= 0.95 | 0.85-0.94 | < 0.85 |

---

### Dimension 6: Stakeholder Health

**Metrics:**

| Metric | Green | Yellow | Red |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| Stakeholder Satisfaction | Satisfied | Concerns | Escalations |
| Communication Effectiveness | Good | Gaps noted | Major issues |
| Decision Timeliness | Timely | Some delays | Blocked |

## Health Check Gates

### Gate 1: Data Collection

**Objective:** Gather current project data

**Actions:**
1. Collect schedule data (actuals, forecasts)
2. Collect cost data (actuals, forecasts)
3. Review scope changes
4. Review quality metrics
5. Update risk register
6. Gather stakeholder feedback

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/project-{name}-data.md`

---

### Gate 2: Health Assessment

**Objective:** Assess each dimension and overall health

**Actions:**
1. Score each dimension (1-10)
2. Calculate overall health score
3. Identify red flags
4. Document root causes

**Health Score Calculation:**

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Schedule | 25% |
| Cost | 20% |
| Scope | 15% |
| Quality | 20% |
| Risk | 10% |
| Stakeholder | 10% |

**Overall Score Interpretation:**
- 8-10: Healthy
- 6-7.9: Manageable
- 4-5.9: At Risk
- < 4: Critical

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/project-{name}-assessment.md`

---

### Gate 3: Recommendations

**Objective:** Provide actionable recommendations

**Actions:**
1. Prioritize issues by impact
2. Identify quick wins
3. Recommend recovery actions
4. Define success criteria

**Recommendation Categories:**

| Category | Urgency | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Immediate** | This week | Escalation, resource injection |
| **Short-term** | This month | Process change, replan |
| **Medium-term** | This quarter | Restructure, descope |
| **Long-term** | Future | Lessons learned, prevention |

**Output:** `docs/pmo/{date}/project-{name}-recommendations.md`

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Health Check-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "PM says project is green" | Self-reported status often optimistic. Verify with data. | **Validate with metrics** |
| "One dimension is off, overall is fine" | One critical dimension can sink a project. | **Address all yellow/red dimensions** |
| "Wait and see if it improves" | Delays compound problems. Early intervention is cheaper. | **Act on warning signs** |
| "They're aware of the issues" | Awareness ≠ action. Verify mitigation progress. | **Confirm corrective actions** |

---

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

### Health Check-Specific Pressures

| Pressure Type | Request | Agent Response |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| "Make the status green for the exec report" | "Status must reflect reality. Will provide accurate status with context and recovery plan." |
| "Don't dig into that dimension" | "All dimensions must be assessed. Selective assessment misses problems." |
| "The PM has it under control" | "PM optimism is natural. Independent assessment provides balance." |

---

## Blocker Criteria - STOP and Report

**ALWAYS pause and report blocker for:**

| Situation | Required Action |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Overall health < 4 (Critical) | STOP. Immediate executive escalation required. |
| Multiple dimensions Red | STOP. Recovery intervention needed. |
| Data unavailable for assessment | STOP. Cannot assess without data. Request information. |
| Stakeholder loss of confidence | STOP. Relationship repair needed before project work. |

### Cannot Be Overridden

**The following requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

| Requirement | Cannot Override Because |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **All six dimensions assessed** | Partial assessment misses critical issues |
| **Data-driven scoring** | Opinions without data lead to wrong conclusions |
| **Root cause analysis for Red** | Symptoms without causes cannot be fixed |
| **Evidence-based status** | Feelings don't predict project outcomes |
| **Stakeholder feedback inclusion** | Project health includes perception, not just metrics |

**If user insists on violating these:**
1. Escalate to orchestrator
2. Do NOT proceed with incomplete assessment
3. Document the request and your refusal

---

## Severity Calibration

When assessing health check findings:

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Project viability at risk | Overall health < 4, sponsor withdrawing, budget frozen |
| **HIGH** | Significant intervention needed | Any dimension Red, schedule slip > 2 weeks, cost overrun > 15% |
| **MEDIUM** | Active management required | Dimensions Yellow, minor variances, stakeholder concerns |
| **LOW** | Normal monitoring | All Green with minor improvements possible |

**Escalate CRITICAL immediately. Address HIGH this week. Monitor MEDIUM bi-weekly.**

## When Health Check Is Not Needed

<MANDATORY>
MUST: Health check is minimal only when ALL conditions are met:
</MANDATORY>

| Condition | Verification |
|-----------|-------------|
| Recent check exists (<14 days) | Reference existing health check |
| No reported issues | Confirm no new risks or blockers |
| Project in maintenance phase | Verify no active development |
| Stakeholders satisfied | Confirm no escalations or concerns |

**MUST: Full health check REQUIRED for the following conditions:**

| Condition | Why Required |
|-----------|-------------|
| Project status changed | Yellow/Red requires immediate assessment |
| Milestone approaching | Risk assessment needed before milestone |
| Stakeholder escalation received | Must diagnose the concern |
| Project phase transition | Entry/exit criteria must be validated |
| Periodic review cadence | Regular health monitoring required |

**MUST: When in doubt, conduct the health check. Undetected issues become crises.**
