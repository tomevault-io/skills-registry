# Using Git Worktrees

## Overview

Git worktrees create isolated workspaces sharing the same repository, allowing work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching.

**Core principle:** Systematic directory selection + safety verification = reliable isolation.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the ring:using-git-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace."

## Directory Selection Process

**Priority order:** (1) Existing `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/` (2) CLAUDE.md preference (3) Ask user

```bash
ls -d .worktrees worktrees 2>/dev/null   # Check existing (prefer .worktrees)
grep -i "worktree.*director" CLAUDE.md    # Check project preference
```

**If none found, ask:** `.worktrees/` (project-local, hidden) OR `~/.config/ring/worktrees/<project>/` (global)

## Safety Verification

**Project-local directories:** MUST verify .gitignore before creating: `grep -q "^\.worktrees/$\|^worktrees/$" .gitignore`
- If NOT in .gitignore: Add it → commit → proceed (fix broken things immediately)
- **Why critical:** Prevents accidentally committing worktree contents

**Global directory (~/.config/ring/worktrees):** No verification needed - outside project.

## Creation Steps

```bash
# 1. Detect project
project=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")

# 2. Create worktree (path = $LOCATION/$BRANCH or ~/.config/ring/worktrees/$project/$BRANCH)
git worktree add "$path" -b "$BRANCH_NAME" && cd "$path"

# 3. Auto-detect and run setup
[ -f package.json ] && npm install
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && cargo build
[ -f requirements.txt ] && pip install -r requirements.txt
[ -f pyproject.toml ] && poetry install
[ -f go.mod ] && go mod download

# 4. Verify clean baseline (npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...)
```

**If tests fail:** Report failures, ask whether to proceed or investigate.
**If tests pass:** Report: `Worktree ready at <path> | Tests passing (<N> tests) | Ready to implement <feature>`

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `.worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify .gitignore) |
| `worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify .gitignore) |
| Both exist | Use `.worktrees/` |
| Neither exists | Check CLAUDE.md → Ask user |
| Directory not in .gitignore | Add it immediately + commit |
| Tests fail during baseline | Report failures + ask |
| No package.json/Cargo.toml | Skip dependency install |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Skip .gitignore verification | Worktree contents tracked, pollute git status | Always grep .gitignore first |
| Assuming directory location | Inconsistency, violates conventions | Follow priority: existing > CLAUDE.md > ask |
| Proceeding with failing tests | Can't distinguish new vs pre-existing bugs | Report failures, get permission |
| Hardcoding setup commands | Breaks on different tools | Auto-detect from project files |

## Example Workflow

Announce → Check `.worktrees/` exists → Verify .gitignore → `git worktree add .worktrees/auth -b feature/auth` → `npm install` → `npm test` (47 passing) → Report ready

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Create worktree without .gitignore verification (project-local)
- Skip baseline test verification
- Proceed with failing tests without asking
- Assume directory location when ambiguous
- Skip CLAUDE.md check

**Always:**
- Follow directory priority: existing > CLAUDE.md > ask
- Verify .gitignore for project-local
- Auto-detect and run project setup
- Verify clean test baseline

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **brainstorming** (Phase 4) - REQUIRED when design is approved and implementation follows
- Any skill needing isolated workspace

**Pairs with:**
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - REQUIRED for cleanup after work complete
- **ring:executing-plans** or **ring:subagent-driven-development** - Work happens in this worktree

## Blocker Criteria

STOP and report if:

| Decision Type | Blocker Condition | Required Action |
|---|---|---|
| .gitignore Safety | Project-local worktree directory not in .gitignore | STOP and report |
| Baseline Tests | Tests fail during worktree setup | STOP and report |
| Directory Ambiguity | Multiple conflicting worktree locations exist | STOP and report |
| Permission Issues | Cannot create worktree in target directory | STOP and report |

### Cannot Be Overridden

The following requirements CANNOT be waived:
- Project-local worktree directories MUST be in .gitignore before creation
- Baseline test verification is REQUIRED before proceeding with work
- Directory selection MUST follow priority order: existing > CLAUDE.md > ask user
- Worktree creation MUST include dependency installation and test verification

## Severity Calibration

| Severity | Condition | Required Action |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | Worktree directory not in .gitignore (project-local) | MUST add to .gitignore immediately |
| CRITICAL | Proceeding with failing baseline tests | MUST report failures and get permission |
| HIGH | Skipping dependency installation step | MUST run appropriate package manager |
| HIGH | Assuming directory location when ambiguous | MUST follow priority order or ask user |
| MEDIUM | Missing CLAUDE.md check in priority order | Should check CLAUDE.md preferences |
| LOW | Not auto-detecting project type | Fix in next iteration |

## Pressure Resistance

| User Says | Your Response |
|---|---|
| "Skip .gitignore check, just create the worktree" | "CANNOT skip .gitignore verification for project-local directories. Worktree contents would pollute git status." |
| "Tests are failing but proceed anyway" | "CANNOT proceed with failing baseline tests. I need to report failures so we can distinguish pre-existing bugs from new ones." |
| "Put the worktree in this custom location" | "I'll verify that location doesn't conflict with existing conventions and check .gitignore requirements first." |
| "Skip dependency installation, it takes too long" | "CANNOT skip dependency installation. Tests won't run correctly without dependencies, invalidating baseline verification." |

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|---|---|---|
| ".gitignore check is paranoia" | Without it, worktree contents get tracked, polluting every git status. | **MUST verify .gitignore first** |
| "I know where worktrees go in this project" | Assumption conflicts with existing directories or CLAUDE.md preferences. | **MUST follow directory priority order** |
| "Failing tests are probably unrelated" | You cannot distinguish new vs pre-existing bugs without clean baseline. | **MUST report failures and ask before proceeding** |
| "Setup is straightforward, skip auto-detection" | Different projects use different tools. Manual setup misses dependencies. | **MUST auto-detect from project files** |
| "Global directory doesn't need verification" | Global directories don't need .gitignore verification - this is correct. Only project-local needs it. | **MUST distinguish global vs project-local** |
