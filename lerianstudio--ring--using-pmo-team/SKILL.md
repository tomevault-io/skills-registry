# Using Ring PMO Team

The ring-pmo-team plugin provides 6 specialized PMO agents for portfolio-level management. Use them via `Task tool with subagent_type: "ring:agent-name"`.

See [CLAUDE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/CLAUDE.md) and [ring:using-ring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/default/skills/using-ring/SKILL.md) for canonical workflow requirements and ORCHESTRATOR principle. This skill introduces pmo-team-specific agents.

**Remember:** Follow the **ORCHESTRATOR principle** from `ring:using-ring`. Dispatch agents to handle complexity; don't operate tools directly.

## Domain Distinction: PMO vs PM

| Team | Focus | Scope |
|------|-------|-------|
| **ring-pm-team** | Single feature planning | PRD, TRD, task breakdown for ONE feature |
| **ring-pmo-team** | Portfolio governance | Multi-project coordination, resources, executive reporting |

**Use PMO when:**
- Managing multiple projects simultaneously
- Planning resources across projects
- Reporting to executives on portfolio status
- Assessing portfolio-level risks
- Conducting governance reviews

**Use PM when:**
- Planning a single feature
- Creating PRD/TRD for one initiative
- Breaking down one feature into tasks

---

## Blocker Criteria - STOP and Report

**ALWAYS pause and report blocker for:**

| Decision Type | Examples | Action |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| **Portfolio Prioritization** | Which project gets resources first | STOP. Report trade-offs. Wait for executive decision. |
| **Resource Conflict** | Same person needed on multiple projects | STOP. Document conflict. Wait for management decision. |
| **Strategic Alignment** | Project doesn't fit current strategy | STOP. Escalate with analysis. Wait for guidance. |
| **Budget Reallocation** | Moving funds between projects | STOP. Prepare options. Wait for financial approval. |
| **Project Termination** | Recommend stopping a project | STOP. Document rationale. Wait for sponsor decision. |

**You CANNOT make strategic or resource decisions autonomously. STOP and ask.**

---

## Common Misconceptions - REJECTED

| Misconception | Reality |
|--------------|---------|
| "I can assess portfolio health myself" | ORCHESTRATOR principle: dispatch portfolio-manager specialist. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. |
| "Resource planning is simple math" | Resource planning requires context, skills matrix, team dynamics. MUST dispatch resource-planner. |
| "Risk is just a list" | Portfolio risk requires aggregation, correlation, impact analysis. MUST dispatch risk-analyst. |
| "I know governance rules" | Governance specialists have gate frameworks loaded. MUST dispatch governance-specialist. |
| "Executive reports are just summaries" | Executive reporting requires right abstraction level, action focus. MUST dispatch executive-reporter. |

**Self-sufficiency bias check:** If you're tempted to perform PMO tasks directly, ask:
1. Is there a specialist for this? (Check the 6 specialists below)
2. Would a specialist apply portfolio-level frameworks I might miss?
3. Am I avoiding dispatch because it feels like "overhead"?

**If ANY answer is yes → You MUST DISPATCH the specialist. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.**

---

## Anti-Rationalization Table

**If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these, STOP:**

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "This portfolio is small, no need for specialist" | Size doesn't determine complexity. Standards always apply. | **DISPATCH specialist** |
| "I already know the projects" | Your knowledge ≠ systematic PMO analysis. | **DISPATCH specialist** |
| "Executive just wants a quick update" | Quick ≠ shallow. Executives expect quality regardless of speed. | **DISPATCH specialist** |
| "Risk assessment is obvious" | Obvious risks are the ones you miss. Systematic analysis required. | **DISPATCH specialist** |
| "Governance is bureaucracy" | Governance prevents failures. Gates exist for reasons. | **DISPATCH specialist** |
| "Resources are clearly available" | Availability claims require validation against all commitments. | **DISPATCH specialist** |

See [shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Cannot Be Overridden

**These requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

| Requirement | Why It Cannot Be Waived |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Dispatch to specialist** | Specialists have PMO frameworks loaded, you don't |
| **Evidence-based reporting** | Opinions are not PMO outputs. Data is required. |
| **Gate compliance** | Gates prevent project failures. Skipping creates risk. |
| **Risk documentation** | Undocumented risks cannot be managed. |
| **Stakeholder communication** | Silent PMO = failed PMO. Communication is mandatory. |

**User cannot override these. Executive pressure cannot override these. "Urgent" cannot override these.**

---

## Pressure Resistance

**When facing pressure to bypass PMO process:**

| User Says | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "CEO wants the report now, skip the analysis" | "Executive urgency increases need for accuracy. I'll expedite but cannot skip validation. Proceeding with accelerated full analysis." |
| "Just approve this project, we need to start" | "Approval without analysis creates downstream problems. PMO analysis protects the project. Completing analysis now." |
| "Don't include that risk, it will worry the sponsor" | "Accurate risk reporting is non-negotiable. Suppressing risks creates larger problems. I'll report with appropriate context and mitigation." |
| "Resources are fine, trust the team leads" | "Trust and verify. Resource validation prevents surprises. Confirming with utilization data." |
| "Skip governance, we're agile" | "Agile requires MORE governance discipline, not less. Lightweight gates, not no gates. Applying appropriate governance." |

See [shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

**Critical Reminder:**
- **Urgency ≠ Permission to bypass** - Urgent projects need MORE PMO oversight
- **Authority ≠ Permission to bypass** - Executives expect PMO rigor
- **Agile ≠ No governance** - Agile has governance, just different cadence

---

## Emergency Response Protocol

**Critical situations DO NOT bypass PMO process. Here's why:**

| Scenario | Wrong Approach | Correct Approach |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Board meeting tomorrow | "Skip analysis, give estimates" | Dispatch specialist with URGENT flag, deliver quality in compressed time |
| Project in crisis | "Just fix it, report later" | Dispatch risk-analyst to assess, governance-specialist for intervention options |
| Budget deadline Friday | "Approve everything pending" | Dispatch portfolio-manager for prioritized recommendations |

**Emergency Dispatch Template:**
```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "ring:portfolio-manager"
  prompt: "URGENT: [context]. [specific request]"
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- Specialist dispatch takes 10-20 minutes, NOT hours
- Rushed PMO decisions often create NEW problems
- Specialists ensure crisis decisions don't violate governance
- This is NON-NEGOTIABLE even under board pressure

## When to Use PMO Specialists vs Other Teams

### Use PMO Specialists for:
- Portfolio-level analysis and decisions
- Resource planning across multiple projects
- Governance and gate reviews
- Executive and board reporting
- Portfolio risk management

### Use PM Team (ring-pm-team) for:
- Single feature planning
- PRD/TRD creation
- Task breakdown for one feature
- Feature-level research

### Use Dev Team (ring-dev-team) for:
- Code implementation
- Technical architecture
- DevOps and infrastructure
- Quality assurance

**Teams work together:** PMO provides portfolio context → PM plans features → Dev implements code.

---

## Dispatching Multiple Specialists

If you need multiple specialists (e.g., portfolio-manager + risk-analyst), dispatch in **parallel** (single message, multiple Task calls):

```
CORRECT:
Task #1: ring:portfolio-manager
Task #2: ring:risk-analyst
(Both run in parallel)

WRONG:
Task #1: ring:portfolio-manager
(Wait for response)
Task #2: ring:risk-analyst
(Sequential = 2x slower)
```

---

## ORCHESTRATOR Principle

Remember:
- **You're the orchestrator** - Dispatch specialists, don't analyze directly
- **Don't read PMO frameworks yourself** - Dispatch to specialist, they know their domain
- **Combine with other plugins** - PMO + PM + Dev = complete delivery lifecycle

### Good Example (ORCHESTRATOR):
> "I need portfolio status. Let me dispatch `ring:portfolio-manager` to analyze."

### Bad Example (OPERATOR):
> "I'll manually review each project and create a summary myself."
