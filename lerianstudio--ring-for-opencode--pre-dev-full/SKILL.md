I'm running the **Full Track** pre-development workflow (9 gates) for your feature.

**This track is for features that have ANY of:**
- ❌ Take ≥2 days to implement
- ❌ Add new external dependencies (APIs, databases, libraries)
- ❌ Create new data models or entities
- ❌ Require multi-service integration
- ❌ Use new architecture patterns
- ❌ Require team collaboration

**If feature is simple (<2 days, existing patterns), use `/ring:pre-dev-feature` instead.**

## Document Organization

All artifacts will be saved to: `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/`

**First, let me ask you about your feature:**

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather:

**Question 1:** "What is the name of your feature?"
- Header: "Feature Name"
- This will be used for the directory name
- Use kebab-case (e.g., "auth-system", "payment-processing", "file-upload")

**Question 2 (CONDITIONAL):** "Does this feature require authentication or authorization?"
- **Auto-detection:** Before asking, check if `go.mod` contains `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-auth`
  - If **found** → Skip this question. Auth is already integrated at project level.
  - If **not found** → Ask this question (new project or project without auth)
- Header: "Auth Requirements"
- Options:
  - "None" - No authentication needed
  - "User authentication only" - Users must log in but no permission checks
  - "User + permissions" - Full user auth with role-based access control
  - "Service-to-service auth" - Machine-to-machine authentication only
  - "Full (user + service-to-service)" - Both user and service auth
- **Note:** For Go services requiring auth, reference `golang.md` → Access Manager Integration section during TRD creation (Gate 3) and Dependency Map (Gate 6)

**Question 3 (CONDITIONAL):** "Is this a licensed product/plugin?"
- **Auto-detection:** Before asking, check if `go.mod` contains `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-license-go`
  - If **found** → Skip this question. Licensing is already integrated at project level.
  - If **not found** → Ask this question (new project or project without licensing)
- Header: "License Requirements"
- Options:
  - "No" - Not a licensed product (open source, internal tool, etc.)
  - "Yes" - Licensed product that requires License Manager integration
- **Note:** For Go services requiring license validation, reference `golang.md` → License Manager Integration section during TRD creation (Gate 3) and Dependency Map (Gate 6)

**Why auto-detection?** Access Manager and License Manager are project-level infrastructure decisions, not feature-level. Once integrated, all features in the project inherit them.

After getting the feature name (and auth/license requirements if applicable), create the directory structure and run the 9-gate workflow:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>
```

## Gate 0: Research Phase (NEW)

**Skill:** ring:pre-dev-research

```
✅ Full Track (9 gates) complete for <feature-name>

Artifacts created:
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/research.md (Gate 0) ← NEW
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/prd.md (Gate 1)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/feature-map.md (Gate 2)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/trd.md (Gate 3)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/api-design.md (Gate 4)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/data-model.md (Gate 5)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/dependency-map.md (Gate 6)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/tasks.md (Gate 7)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/subtasks.md (Gate 8)

Planning time: 2-4 hours (comprehensive)

Next steps:
1. Review artifacts in docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/
2. Use /ring:worktree to create isolated workspace
3. Use /ring:write-plan to create implementation plan
4. Execute the plan
```

## Remember

- This is the **Full Track** - comprehensive and thorough
- All 9 gates provide maximum planning depth
- **Gate 0 (Research) runs 3 agents in parallel** for codebase, best practices, and framework docs
- Technology decisions happen at Gate 6 (Dependency Map)
- All documents saved to `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/`
- Get human approval at each gate before proceeding
- Planning investment (2-4 hours) pays off during implementation

## MANDATORY: Skills Orchestration

**This command orchestrates multiple skills in a 9-gate workflow.**

### Gate Sequence

| Gate | Skill | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | `ring:pre-dev-research` | Domain/technical research |
| 1 | `ring:pre-dev-prd-creation` | Product requirements |
| 2 | `ring:pre-dev-feature-map` | Feature scope |
| 3 | `ring:pre-dev-trd-creation` | Technical requirements |
| 4 | `ring:pre-dev-api-design` | API contracts |
| 5 | `ring:pre-dev-data-model` | Data architecture |
| 6 | `ring:pre-dev-dependency-map` | Technology selection |
| 7 | `ring:pre-dev-task-breakdown` | Task decomposition |
| 8 | `ring:pre-dev-subtask-creation` | Implementation steps |

### Execution Pattern

```
For each gate:
  Use Skill tool: [gate-skill]
  Wait for human approval
  Proceed to next gate
```

Each skill contains its own:
- Anti-rationalization tables
- Gate pass criteria
- Output format requirements

**Do NOT skip gates.** Each gate builds on the previous gate's output.
