Use when an eval run has errors, crashes, or unexpected failures that need diagnosis. Use when this capability is needed.

# Analyzing Eval Errors

Use this skill when:
- An eval run has errored samples that need investigation
- CLI crashes need diagnosis (exit code 1, empty stderr)
- Scores seem wrong and you suspect false failures
- You need to determine if agents actually completed on the server despite being recorded as errors

## Quick Start: Run the Analysis Script

For an initial overview, run `scripts/analyze_errors.py`:

```bash
# Classify errors from JSONL (no API calls)
python <skill-dir>/scripts/analyze_errors.py --results-dir path/to/results

# Full analysis with Letta server cross-reference
python <skill-dir>/scripts/analyze_errors.py --results-dir path/to/results --check-server
```

This produces `error_analysis.json` with classified errors and server state. Read the output to understand the error landscape before diving deeper.

## Investigation Workflow

### Step 1: Parse and Classify

Read `results.jsonl` and `summary.json`. See [references/results-schema.md](references/results-schema.md) for the data format.

Classify errors into buckets:
- **timeout** — `"timed out"` in error message. Usually expected. Skip unless investigating slow models.
- **cli_crash** — `"return code"` in error message. The letta CLI subprocess crashed. Most common bug category.
- **extraction** — `ExtractionError`. Agent ran but produced no extractable submission.
- **grading** — Grading failed after extraction succeeded.
- **other** — Anything else.

### Step 2: Cross-Reference with Server

For non-timeout errors, check what actually happened on the server. See [references/letta-sdk-inspection.md](references/letta-sdk-inspection.md) for API details.

For each errored agent:

1. **Check agent state**: `client.agents.retrieve(agent_id)` → is `last_stop_reason` `"end_turn"` (normal) or `"error"`?
2. **Check messages**: `client.agents.messages.list(agent_id, limit=200, order="asc")` → did the agent produce a final `assistant_message`?
3. **Compare**: If JSONL says error but server shows `assistant_message` at end → **false failure**.

### Step 3: Investigate Discrepancies

For false failures (agent completed on server but recorded as error):

1. **Find ghost runs**: Compare `client.runs.list(agent_id)` against run_ids from messages. Runs with zero messages are ghost runs.
2. **Inspect ghost runs**: `client.runs.retrieve(run_id)` → check `metadata.error` for the actual error detail.
3. **Check timing**: Compare ghost run `created_at` vs last message `date`. Ghost runs typically appear 0.5-2s after the agent's final message.

For extraction errors (agent never responded):

1. **Check run steps**: `client.runs.steps.list(run_id)` → check `completion_tokens`. Zero tokens with `status="success"` means the provider returned an empty response.
2. **Check provider**: `step.provider_name` identifies which LLM provider is responsible.

### Step 4: Generate Report

Write a structured markdown report with:

1. **Summary**: Total errors, breakdown by model and error type
2. **Per-bug section**: For each distinct error pattern found:
   - Description of what happens
   - Evidence (agent IDs, run IDs, timestamps)
   - Impact (false failure count, corrected scores)
3. **Agent ID table**: For debugging, include agent IDs and ghost run IDs so the team can inspect directly

## Known Error Patterns

### Ghost Run (CLI sends stale approval after agent completion)

**Symptom**: CLI exits code 1, empty stderr. Agent completed on server with `assistant_message`. Ghost run exists with error `"Cannot process approval response: No tool call is currently awaiting approval"`.

**Cause**: In `--yolo` mode, the CLI sends a delayed approval after the agent's final run has already ended. This creates a new run that immediately fails.

**Affected models**: minimax-m2.5 (~50% crash rate), kimi-k2.5 (~18%), glm-5 (~6%).

### Zero-Token Completion (provider returns empty response)

**Symptom**: Extraction error. Agent has 2 messages (system + user). Run step shows `completion_tokens=0`, `status="success"`, `stop_reason="end_turn"`.

**Cause**: The LLM provider returns an empty response that the server treats as a valid end-of-turn.

### Approval Race Conditions (older letta-code versions)

**Symptom**: Various errors — "Failed to fetch pending approvals for resync", "CONFLICT: Cannot send a new message", "Unexpected stop reason: error". Agent may be stuck with `last_message_type=approval_request_message`.

**Cause**: CLI loses sync with the server's approval state during `--yolo` mode execution. Mostly fixed in newer versions but ghost run pattern persists.
