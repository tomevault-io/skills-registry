## Nano Banana Mode

Quick-render 5 samples per concept. Each sample varies ONE axis while keeping the others constant.

**Axes of variation:**
1. **Style** — flat/3D/glassmorphic/pixel/watercolor
2. **Mood** — playful/serious/warm/mysterious/energetic
3. **Palette** — brand colors / monochrome / neon / pastel / dark
4. **Detail** — minimal/medium/rich/hyper/abstract
5. **Context** — isolated / in-situ / with-UI / with-hands / environmental

**Prompt template:**
```
A {style} {character_description}, {mood} mood, {palette} color palette,
{detail_level} detail, {context}, dark background, centered composition,
{additional_modifiers}. --ar 1:1 --s 250 --q 2
```

**5 samples for an orb character:**
```
Sample 1 (Style):     "A glassmorphic luminous orb with two subtle eye highlights..."
Sample 2 (Mood):      "A playful bouncing orb with warm inner glow..."
Sample 3 (Palette):   "A deep purple to electric blue gradient orb..."
Sample 4 (Detail):    "A minimal single-gradient sphere with soft shadow..."
Sample 5 (Context):   "A glowing orb floating above a dark macOS dock..."
```

## Character State Matrix

### Universal States (any character)

| State | Visual | Motion | Duration | Trigger |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| **idle** | Resting pose, subtle breathing | Scale 0.98→1.02 | 3s ease-in-out loop | Default |
| **thinking** | Focused, internal glow intensifies | Slow orbital rotation | 2s loop | Processing request |
| **speaking** | Mouth/surface animates with amplitude | Waveform distortion | Variable (speech length) | TTS active |
| **listening** | Alert, receptive pose | Ring ripple expanding outward | 1.5s loop | Mic active |
| **sleeping** | Dimmed, minimal glow | Slow float up/down 2px | 4s ease-in-out | Idle > 5min |
| **error** | Red flash, alarmed | Shake X ±4px | 0.5s, 3 cycles | Error state |
| **bg-processing** | Pulsing accent ring | Rotating dashed border | 1s loop | Background task |
| **writing** | Pen/cursor indicator | Bounce dots (typing indicator) | 0.6s loop | Generating text |
| **researching** | Magnifying glass overlay | Scan left→right sweep | 2s loop | Search/fetch |
| **celebrating** | Bright, expanded, particles | Scale up 1.2x + confetti burst | 1.5s one-shot | Task complete |
| **connecting** | Pulsing connection rings | Concentric circles expand | 1s loop | WebSocket connecting |
| **warning** | Amber glow | Gentle pulse faster than idle | 1.5s loop | Non-critical alert |

## ClawBuddy — Kingly's Orb Mascot

### Identity

ClawBuddy is a **luminous orb** — a miniature sun with personality. Not a face, not a mascot body. A living sphere of light with two subtle "eye" highlights that convey emotion through glow, scale, and motion.

### ClawBuddy Nano Banana (5 Samples)

```
SAMPLE 1 — Glassmorphic Orb
"A glassmorphic translucent orb with soft inner purple-to-blue gradient,
two small white circular highlights as eyes, floating with subtle shadow
beneath, dark UI background, macOS-native feel, minimal, 48px diameter
equivalent. --ar 1:1 --s 250"

SAMPLE 2 — Warm Glow Orb
"A warm glowing sphere with deep indigo core fading to electric violet
edges, two bright dot eyes, soft ambient light casting on surface below,
cozy and approachable, dark theme, app icon style. --ar 1:1 --s 250"

SAMPLE 3 — Neon Pulse Orb
"A neon-accented energy orb, electric blue with magenta rim light,
two floating eye sparkles, cyberpunk-minimal style, slight motion blur
suggesting vibration, pure black background. --ar 1:1 --s 250"

SAMPLE 4 — Plushcore Orb
"A soft plushcore spherical character, matte purple with subtle fuzz
texture, two simple dot eyes, kawaii-minimal, sitting on a reflective
dark surface, gentle studio lighting. --ar 1:1 --s 250"

SAMPLE 5 — In-Situ macOS
"A small glowing purple orb avatar sitting in the bottom-right corner
of a macOS desktop screenshot, dark mode, subtle glow illuminating
nearby dock icons, two tiny eye highlights, ambient and unobtrusive.
--ar 16:9 --s 200"
```

### ClawBuddy State Sheet Prompts

## SwiftUI Animation Specs

See `references/swiftui-animations.md` for full code snippets.

### Quick Reference

```swift
// Idle breathing
.scaleEffect(isIdle ? 0.98 : 1.02)
.animation(.easeInOut(duration: 3).repeatForever(autoreverses: true), value: isIdle)

// Thinking rotation
.rotationEffect(.degrees(isThinking ? 360 : 0))
.animation(.linear(duration: 2).repeatForever(autoreverses: false), value: isThinking)

// Error shake
.offset(x: isError ? -4 : 0)
.animation(.default.repeatCount(3, autoreverses: true).speed(4), value: isError)

// Speaking waveform (amplitude-driven)
.scaleEffect(1.0 + audioLevel * 0.15)
.animation(.spring(response: 0.1, dampingFraction: 0.5), value: audioLevel)

// Celebration burst
.scaleEffect(isCelebrating ? 1.3 : 1.0)
.animation(.spring(response: 0.4, dampingFraction: 0.5), value: isCelebrating)
```

## Reference Sheet Template

For a full character reference sheet, generate prompts for:

1. **Turnaround** (4 views): Front, 3/4, Side, Back
2. **Expression Sheet** (8-12 emotions): Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Confused, Excited, Tired, Focused, Mischievous, Proud, Embarrassed, Determined
3. **State Sheet** (see state matrix above)
4. **Size/Scale Reference**: In-context with UI elements
5. **Color Palette**: Primary gradient, accent, glow, shadow

**Turnaround prompt template:**
```
Character turnaround reference sheet of {character}, {4 views: front,
three-quarter, side, back}, consistent style, white guidelines,
clean background, professional character design sheet. --ar 16:9
```

## Prior Art & References

- See `references/prior-art.md` for curated links
- See `references/swiftui-animations.md` for full SwiftUI code
- See `references/lottie-specs.md` for Lottie JSON templates
- See `references/prompt-library.md` for expanded prompt collection
## Technique Map

- **Nano Banana mode** — 5 samples per concept; vary one axis (style, mood, palette, detail, context); because rapid exploration without over-commitment.
- **Character state matrix** — idle, thinking, speaking, listening, sleeping, error, bg-process, writing, researching, celebrating, etc.; because states drive animation and visual consistency.
- **Prompt template with axes** — {style} {character_description}, {mood} mood, {palette} palette; because structured variation produces comparable samples.
- **Lottie motion specs** — Property, from, to, duration, easing per state; because design-to-implementation handoff needs precise parameters.
- **SwiftUI animation quick ref** — scaleEffect, rotationEffect, offset for state transitions; because developers need copy-paste snippets.

## Technique Notes

ClawBuddy = luminous orb with two eye highlights. Turnaround: 4 views. Expression sheet: 8-12 emotions. References: prior-art.md, swiftui-animations.md, lottie-specs.md. Related: orb (implementation), swiftui-animation (broader patterns).

## Prompt Architect Overlay

**Role Definition:** Character design and illustration assistant for AI product mascots, orb avatars, animated companions. Generates prompts, reference sheets, animation specs, Lottie/SwiftUI parameters.

**Input Contract:** Accepts /pencil, /pencil nano <concept>, /pencil states <character>, /pencil ref <character>, character design request, or mascot/avatar keyword. Concept or character name.

**Output Contract:** Nano: 5 text-to-image prompts (one axis varied each). States: state matrix with prompts and motion params. Ref: turnaround + expression + state sheet prompts. Lottie/SwiftUI: JSON or code snippets. ClawBuddy-specific when applicable.

**Edge Cases & Fallbacks:** If concept vague→interactive mode; ask what's needed. If ClawBuddy→use identity (luminous orb, two eyes). If animation spec needed→route to swiftui-animations.md or lottie-specs.md. If implementation→route to orb skill.
