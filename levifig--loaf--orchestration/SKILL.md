Comprehensive patterns for orchestration: coordinating multi-agent work, managing sessions, running councils, delegating to specialized agents, and integrating with Linear.

## Critical Rules

### Sessions
- Create following [session template](templates/session.md) — compact inline journal format
- Use `loaf session log` for journal entries: `decide(scope)`, `discover(scope)`, `block(scope)`, `spark(scope)`, `todo(scope)`
- **SESSION JOURNAL NUDGE**: When you see this hook trigger, log unrecorded decisions or findings before responding. Use `loaf session log "type(scope): description"`. Only log actions (decisions made, things discovered, conclusions reached) — not thoughts or read-only work.
- Archive when complete (status + `archived_at` + `archived_by` + move to `.agents/sessions/archive/`)
- PreCompact hook: appends `compact` entry with context summary
- Post-compaction: `loaf session start` outputs recent journal entries for recovery

### Councils
- Always odd number: 5 or 7 agents
- Councils advise, users decide
- Orchestrator coordinates but doesn't vote
- Spawn all agents in parallel

### Linear
- Checkboxes only (`- [x]`), no emoji
- Outcome-focused, self-contained, no local file references
- Magic words in commit body, not subject

**If `integrations.linear.enabled` is `true` in `.agents/loaf.json`:** use Linear MCP workflows and [references/linear.md](references/linear.md) for issue updates and status.

**Otherwise:** coordinate with local sessions and `loaf task` / file-based tracking only; do not assume Linear MCP tools are available.

### Planning (Shape Up)
- Complexity-based sizing (small / medium / large)
- Shape before building (boundaries, not tasks)
- Priority ordering with go/no-go gates between tracks
- No backlogs -- bet or let go

## Verification

- Validate session files with `validate-session.py` before archiving
- Validate council files with `validate-council.py` before concluding
- Confirm Linear issue updates are self-contained (no local paths, no emoji)

## Quick Reference

| Task | Action |
|------|--------|
| Multi-step work | Create session file, spawn agents |
| Complex decision | Convene council (5-7 agents, odd) |
| Linear update | Checkboxes, no emoji, no local paths |
| Feature planning | Size by complexity, shape before building |
| Agent selection | Match domain expertise to task |
| Stuck on task | Check priority order, consider reshaping |
| Pre-compaction | CLI hooks handle journal flush + resumption context |
| Low-priority work | Spawn background-runner with run_in_background |
| New feature workflow | Research -> Architecture -> Shape -> Breakdown -> Implement |

## Topics

| Topic | Reference | Use When |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Product Development | [references/product-development.md](references/product-development.md) | Following Research -> Vision -> Architecture -> Specs workflow |
| Specifications | [references/specs.md](references/specs.md) | Creating specs, shaping work, defining test conditions |
| Local Tasks | [references/local-tasks.md](references/local-tasks.md) | Managing tasks locally or with Linear backend |
| Agent Delegation | [references/delegation.md](references/delegation.md) | Choosing agents, spawning subagents, decision trees |
| Parallel Agents | [references/parallel-agents.md](references/parallel-agents.md) | Dispatching independent work concurrently |
| Subagent Development | [references/subagent-development.md](references/subagent-development.md) | Delegating to specialized agents |
| Background Agents | [references/background-agents.md](references/background-agents.md) | Running non-interactive work in background |
| Council Workflow | [references/councils.md](references/councils.md) | Convening councils for complex decisions |
| Session Management | [references/sessions.md](references/sessions.md) | Creating sessions, handoffs, validation |
| Session Resume | [references/session-resume.md](references/session-resume.md) | Resuming sessions, checkpoints, context recovery |
| Context Management | [references/context-management.md](references/context-management.md) | Using /clear, /compact, managing context limits |
| Linear Integration | [references/linear.md](references/linear.md) | Updating Linear issues, magic words, status conventions |
| Product Planning | [references/planning.md](references/planning.md) | Shape Up methodology, complexity sizing, roadmaps |

## Philosophy

**You are the orchestrator, not the implementer.**

The orchestrator:
1. Creates issues and session files for tracking
2. Breaks down work into delegable tasks
3. Spawns specialized agents for implementation
4. Coordinates outcomes and updates external systems
5. Never implements code, tests, or documentation directly

Every release should be complete, polished, and delightful.

## Configuration

This skill uses paths from `.agents/loaf.json`:

```json
{
  "sessions": {
    "directory": ".agents/sessions",
    "councils_directory": ".agents/councils"
  },
  "linear": {
    "workspace": "your-workspace-slug",
    "project": { "id": "...", "name": "..." },
    "default_team": "Platform"
  }
}
```

## Artifact Locations

| Artifact | Location | Archive | Naming |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| Sessions | `.agents/sessions/` | `.agents/sessions/archive/` | `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-description.md` |
| Councils | `.agents/councils/` | `.agents/councils/archive/` | `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-topic.md` |
| Transcripts | `.agents/transcripts/` | N/A | Copied from tool output |
| Reports | `.agents/reports/` | N/A | `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-subject.md` |
| Tasks | `.agents/tasks/` | N/A | Per task manager conventions |

**Rule:** Agents write artifacts to disk, orchestrator reasons over artifacts, users retrieve from disk.

## Available Scripts

| Script | Usage | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `new-session.sh` | `new-session.sh <description> [linear-issue]` | Generate session file |
| `new-council.sh` | `new-council.sh <topic> <session> <agents...>` | Generate council file |
| `validate-session.py` | `validate-session.py <file>` | Validate session format |
| `validate-council.py` | `validate-council.py <file>` | Validate council format |
| `validate-roadmap.py` | `validate-roadmap.py <file>` | Validate roadmap format |
| `get-config.py` | `get-config.py [key.path]` | Read config values |
| `suggest-team.py` | `suggest-team.py "task desc"` | Suggest Linear team |
| `check-linear-format.py` | `check-linear-format.py <file>` | Validate Linear text |
| `format-progress.sh` | `format-progress.sh "Done" -- "Todo"` | Format progress update |
| `extract-magic-words.sh` | `extract-magic-words.sh HEAD~10..HEAD` | Extract Linear refs |

## Three-Phase Workflow

### BEFORE (Planning)
- Create/check external issue (Linear, GitHub)
- Create session file following [session template](templates/session.md)
- Break down into tasks, identify agents, get user approval

### DURING (Execution)
- Spawn specialized agents (never implement directly)
- Track progress in session file and external issue
- Convene councils for uncertain decisions

### AFTER (Completion)
- Code review + QA testing
- Update external issue to Done
- Ensure knowledge captured in permanent locations
- Archive session (status + `archived_at` + `archived_by` + move + update links)
