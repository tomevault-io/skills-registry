# TypeScript Development

Modern TypeScript development with React ecosystem.

## Critical Rules

### Always

- Use strict mode in tsconfig
- Type all function parameters and returns
- Handle null/undefined explicitly
- Use Server Components by default
- Validate on both client and server
- Test with screen readers
- Measure before optimizing

### Never

- Use `any` (use `unknown` with type guards)
- Use `!` (non-null assertion) without justification
- Store server data in client state (use React Query)
- Rely on color alone for information
- Create new functions in render
- Skip error handling for API calls

## Verification

### After Editing TypeScript/JavaScript Files

**Type Checking:**
- If `tsc` is available, run: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Checks entire project against tsconfig.json
- Common fixes: add proper type annotations, use union types for nullable values, import types from @types/* packages

**Linting:**
- If `eslint` is available, run: `npx eslint {files}`
- To auto-fix issues: `npx eslint --fix {files}`

**Bundle Analysis (for component files):**
- Check file size and LOC when modifying components
- Warn if file > 100 KB or > 500 lines of code
- Consider breaking into smaller components for large files
- Use code splitting and lazy loading for heavy dependencies

### Before Committing

- Run type checker on the entire project
- Run ESLint on modified files
- Verify component sizes are reasonable
- Check for console errors and warnings
