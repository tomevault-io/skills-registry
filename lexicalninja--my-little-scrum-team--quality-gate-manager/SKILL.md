# Quality Gate Manager Skill

## Instructions

1. Define quality criteria for the gate
2. Review work against criteria
3. Check if criteria are met
4. Identify any gaps or issues
5. Make go/no-go decision
6. Document gate results
7. Provide feedback for improvements if needed

## Quality Gate Process

### Step 1: Define Quality Criteria
- Identify what "ready" means for this gate
- Set specific, measurable criteria
- Define acceptance standards
- Note any exceptions or waivers

### Step 2: Review Work
- Examine work deliverables
- Check against criteria
- Verify completeness
- Assess quality

### Step 3: Evaluate Against Criteria
- Check each criterion
- Note which criteria are met
- Identify gaps
- Assess severity of gaps

### Step 4: Make Decision
- **Approve**: Work meets criteria, can proceed
- **Request Changes**: Work needs improvements before proceeding
- **Block**: Work does not meet standards, must fix

### Step 5: Document Results
- Record gate results
- Note any issues
- Provide feedback
- Track resolution

## Quality Gate Types

## Examples

### Example 1: Specification Gate - Approved

**Input**: Review specification for user dashboard

**Output**:
```markdown
## Quality Gate: Specification Gate

### Gate Type
Specification

### Work Reviewed
specification-user-dashboard.md

### Quality Criteria

#### Criterion 1: All requirements documented
- **Status**: Met
- **Notes**: All functional and non-functional requirements are documented

#### Criterion 2: Technical approach defined
- **Status**: Met
- **Notes**: Technology stack, architecture, and implementation approach are clearly defined

#### Criterion 3: Dependencies identified
- **Status**: Met
- **Notes**: Dependencies on authentication, database, and API are identified

#### Criterion 4: Acceptance criteria clear
- **Status**: Met
- **Notes**: Clear acceptance criteria for each requirement

#### Criterion 5: No ambiguous requirements
- **Status**: Met
- **Notes**: All requirements are clear and unambiguous

### Overall Assessment
**Status**: Approved

### Issues Found
None

### Feedback
Specification is complete and ready for task breakdown. All criteria are met.

### Decision
**Can Proceed**: Yes
**Required Changes**: None
**Next Steps**: Proceed to scrum-master for task breakdown
```

### Example 2: Design Gate - Changes Requested

**Input**: Review design specifications for login page

**Output**:
```markdown
## Quality Gate: Design Gate

### Gate Type
Design

### Work Reviewed
Design specifications for login page (TASK-010-DESIGN)

### Quality Criteria

#### Criterion 1: Design specs complete
- **Status**: Met
- **Notes**: Layout, components, colors, and typography are specified

#### Criterion 2: Accessibility requirements met
- **Status**: Partial
- **Notes**: Most accessibility requirements met, but missing focus indicators specification

#### Criterion 3: Responsive design specified
- **Status**: Met
- **Notes**: Breakpoints and responsive behavior are defined

#### Criterion 4: Design tokens defined
- **Status**: Met
- **Notes**: Colors, spacing, and typography tokens are defined

2. **Review Work**: Examine work deliverables
3. **Check Criteria**: Evaluate against each criterion
4. **Make Decision**: Approve, request changes, or block
5. **Document Results**: Record gate results
6. **Follow Up**: Track resolution of requested changes

### Gate Approval Levels
