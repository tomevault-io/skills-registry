# Rust Performance and Layout

Use this when performance matters enough to justify design pressure.

## Working stance

- Measure before changing shapes.
- Fix the largest hot-path cost, not the most obvious micro-optimization.
- Keep iterator pipelines lazy until you genuinely need a collection.
- Reuse allocations and tighten data movement before reaching for cleverness.
- Keep layout decisions explicit when they affect cache use or FFI.
- Prefer simple code unless profiling proves it is the bottleneck.

## Decision surface

| Pressure | First move |
| --- | --- |
| repeated allocation | reuse buffers, pre-size collections |
| large enum or struct footprint | inspect layout, box rare large fields |
| string and byte churn | borrow or use slices/bytes where lifetimes allow |
| clone-heavy hot path | revisit ownership and API boundaries |
| "faster" rewrite with no numbers | benchmark first |

## Red flags

- benchmarking starts after the rewrite,
- iterator chains collect into temporary `Vec`s only to be filtered or walked
  again,
- hot loops build strings with repeated `format!()` calls,
- index-based loops appear where iterators express the same walk clearly,
- tiny local wins complicate the API surface,
- hot-path code formats strings or allocates collections repeatedly,
- data layout changes happen without measuring access patterns,
- unsafe code is introduced before safe structural fixes are tried.

Read [allocation-and-reuse.md](references/allocation-and-reuse.md),
[data-layout.md](references/data-layout.md),
[benchmark-discipline.md](references/benchmark-discipline.md), and
[rigorous-benchmarking.md](references/rigorous-benchmarking.md) for the
common forks. The last covers paired benchmarking (Tango), deterministic
profiling (`iai-callgrind`), open-versus-closed load models, tail latency
and goodput.
