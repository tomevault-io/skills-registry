description: Select and combine Rust verification tools — Miri, sanitizers, property testing, mutation testing, deterministic concurrency exploration (loom, shuttle, turmoil), bounded model checking (Kani), and deductive proofs (Verus). Use when choosing the smallest tool that gives the required guarantee for a given failure mode. Use when this capability is needed.

# Rust verification: choosing the right adversary

Tests show a program works on the inputs you tried. Verification tools
attack the program with adversaries chosen by failure mode: UB,
unexpected inputs, schedule chaos, logic gaps, exhaustive state, or
unbounded reasoning. Pick the smallest adversary that fits the property
at risk.

## Working stance

- Name the failure mode before naming the tool.
- Each tool is additive: Miri does not replace proptest, Kani does not
  replace Verus.
- Run cheap adversaries on every change; reserve expensive sweeps for
  code where they pay back.
- The effort is not finished until a deliberate mutation of the
  production code is caught by it.

## Selection by failure mode

| Failure mode                                          | First reach        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Undefined behaviour in `unsafe` (aliasing, init, UB)  | Miri + sanitizers  |
| Input gaps in pure functions                          | `proptest`         |
| "My tests pass but my logic is wrong"                 | `cargo-mutants`    |
| Async cancellation, ordering, partial-failure         | `turmoil`          |
| Atomic / lock-free memory ordering on a single core   | `loom`             |
| Mutex / channel scheduling on a single core           | `shuttle`          |
| Structural invariant over a bounded state space       | `kani`             |
| Algebraic property over an unbounded domain           | `verus`            |

See [`references/tool-selection.md`](references/tool-selection.md) for a
longer walkthrough with one paragraph per tool.

## Layering rule

Climb only when the layer below is clean; bugs found higher up are much
harder to diagnose.

1. Unit tests anchor concrete expectations.
2. Miri and sanitizers catch UB on the inputs tests already exercise.
3. `proptest` widens inputs; `cargo-mutants` checks the tests can fail.
4. `loom`, `shuttle`, and `turmoil` shake the schedule.
5. `kani` proves bounded structural invariants.
6. `verus` proves unbounded algebraic properties.

## Deterministic chaos

`loom`, `shuttle`, `turmoil`, and `kani` require the system under test
to be deterministic given its inputs. Hidden non-determinism (clocks,
RNG, thread IDs, env reads) breaks reproduction. See
[`references/deterministic-chaos.md`](references/deterministic-chaos.md)
for the fences chaos tools require.

## Red flags

- "We already test this" and a one-line mutation does not break the test.
- An `unsafe` block has a safety comment but never runs under Miri.
- A `proptest` regression file is checked in but never minimised or
  promoted to a unit test.
- A Kani harness or Verus proof references symbols that no longer match
  production — the mirror is decaying.
- Concurrency tests pass locally and flake in CI; `loom`, `shuttle`, or
  `turmoil` have not been tried.

## Routing into deep dives

- Strategy design, shrinking discipline, regression files, the
  filtering trap, and state-machine tests:
  [`proptest`](../proptest/SKILL.md).
- Kani harness shape, unwind discipline, contracts, stubbing:
  [`kani`](../kani/SKILL.md).
- Verus modes, triggers, sequence proofs, `assert by`:
  [`verus`](../verus/SKILL.md).

Proptest is a regular Cargo dev-dependency; `kani` and `verus`
install via
[`rust-prover-tools`](https://github.com/leynos/rust-prover-tools).
The selection rules above stay authoritative for picking between
them.
