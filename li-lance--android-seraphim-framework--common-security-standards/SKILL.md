Use when implementing authentication, encryption, authorization, input validation, secret management, or any security-sensitive feature across any language or framework. (triggers: **/*.ts, **/*.tsx, **/*.go, **/*.dart, **/*.java, **/*.kt, **/*.swift, **/*.py, security, encrypt, authenticate, authorize) Use when this capability is needed.

# Security Standards

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

## Always-Apply Rules

Apply these on **every code write**, regardless of context:

- **No hardcoded secrets**: Use environment variables or secret managers. Never commit keys,
  passwords, or tokens to source control.
- **No raw SQL strings**: Use parameterized queries or ORMs — `WHERE id = ${userId}` is always
  wrong.
- **No stacktraces in prod**: Return generic error codes; log full detail server-side only.

## Workflow

Activate when: implementing auth, encryption, authorization, input handling, or any
security-sensitive feature.

1. **Identify trust boundaries** — map every data entry point (API, UI, CSV, webhook).
2. **Validate and sanitize** all external input at each boundary.
3. **Apply least privilege** to users, services, and containers.
4. **Verify** with SAST/DAST scanners in CI before merge.

## Context-Specific Rules

### Data Safeguarding

- **Zero Trust**: Never trust external input. Sanitize and validate every data boundary.
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions to users, services, and containers.
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data-at-rest; TLS 1.3 for data-in-transit.
- **PII Logging**: Never log PII (email, phone, names). Mask sensitive fields before logging.

See [implementation examples](references/implementation.md) for parameterized queries and secret
management.

### Secure Coding

- **Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries or ORMs to stop SQL, Command, and XSS
  injections.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly scan (`npm audit`, `pip audit`) and update third-party
  libraries to patch CVEs.
- **Secure Auth**: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and secure session management.
- **Error Privacy**: Never leak stack traces or internal implementation details to the end-user.

### Continuous Security

- **Shift Left**: Integrate security scanners (SAST/DAST) early in the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Data Minimization**: Collect and store only the minimum data required for business logic.
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain logs for sensitive operations (Auth, Deletion, Admin changes).

## Anti-Patterns

- **No default passwords**: Force rotation on first use with strong entropy requirements.
