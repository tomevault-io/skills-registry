# Golang Architecture

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

## Principles

- **Clean Architecture**: Inner layers (Domain) rely on nothing. Outer layers (Adapters) rely on
  inner.
- **Project Layout**: Follow standard Go layout (`cmd`, `internal`, `pkg`).
- **Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies via constructors. Avoid global singletons.
- **Package Oriented Design**: Organize by feature/domain, not by layer.
- **Interface Segregation**: Define interfaces where they are _used_ (consumer side).

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Set up project layout** — Use `cmd/` for entry points, `internal/` for private packages, `pkg/`
   for shared libraries.
2. **Define domain layer** — Inner-most layer with zero external dependencies.
3. **Build use cases** — Depend only on Domain interfaces.
4. **Implement adapters** — Outer layer depends on UseCase/Domain. Contains HTTP handlers, DB repos,
   etc.
5. **Wire in main** — Compose the full dependency graph in `main.go`.

See [constructor injection and wiring examples](references/clean-arch.md)

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] No global singletons or package-level mutable variables
- [ ] Dependencies explicitly passed via constructors
- [ ] Interfaces defined at the consumer side
- [ ] `internal/domain` has zero external dependencies
- [ ] Dependencies wired together in `main.go`

## Anti-Patterns

- **No global singletons**: Use DI; avoid package-level mutable variables.
- **No layer violations**: Domain must not import from adapter/infrastructure layers.
- **No god services**: Split into single-responsibility components.
