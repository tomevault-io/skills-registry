description: Write safe concurrent Go code with goroutines, channels, and context. Use when implementing concurrency with goroutines, channels, or context in Go. (triggers: goroutine, go keyword, channel, mutex, waitgroup, context, errgroup, race condition) Use when this capability is needed.

# Golang Concurrency

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

## Principles

- **Share Memory by Communicating**: Use channels instead of shared memory.
- **Context is King**: Always pass `ctx` to manage cancellation/timeouts.
- **Prevent Leaks**: Never start a goroutine without knowing how it will stop.
- **Race Detection**: Always run tests with `go test -race`.

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Choose primitive** — Channels for data passing, `sync.Mutex` for simple state protection,
   `errgroup` for parallel tasks with error handling.
2. **Pass context** — Every goroutine that does I/O or long work must accept `context.Context`.
3. **Define exit paths** — Every goroutine must have a clear shutdown mechanism (context
   cancellation, channel close, or WaitGroup).
4. **Use select for multiplexing** — Handle multiple channels or timeouts with `select`.
5. **Test with race detector** — Run `go test -race` in CI.

See [ErrGroup and concurrency patterns](references/concurrency-patterns.md)
and [context timeout examples](references/context-usage.md)

## Anti-Patterns

- **No goroutine leaks**: Every goroutine must have a known exit path.
- **No shared global state**: Use channels or sync primitives across goroutines.
- **No bare goroutines**: Use `errgroup` or `WaitGroup` for lifecycle management.
