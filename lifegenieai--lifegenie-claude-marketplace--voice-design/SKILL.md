# ElevenLabs Voice Design Prompting

Expert guidance for creating AI-generated voices using ElevenLabs Voice Design.

## Quick Start Decision Tree

| Goal                 | Approach                                                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generic narrator     | Short prompt: "A calm male narrator"                      |
| Specific character   | Detailed prompt with age, accent, tone, pacing, emotion   |
| High audio quality   | Add "perfect audio quality" or "studio-quality recording" |
| Stylized/lo-fi audio | Add "low-fidelity audio" or "sounds like a voicemail"     |
| Strong accent        | Use "thick" (not "strong"): "thick French accent"         |
| Subtle accent        | Use "slight": "slight Southern drawl"                     |

## Prompt Structure Template

Build prompts by combining these elements:

```
[Audio Quality] + [Age] + [Gender] + [Accent] + [Tone/Timbre] + [Pacing] + [Character/Emotion]
```

**Example:**

> "Perfect audio quality. A man in his 40s with a thick British accent. His
> voice is deep and warm, speaking at a natural conversational pace. He sounds
> confident and approachable."

## Phrasing Experimentation

How you phrase descriptors matters. The same concept written differently can
produce noticeably different results:

| Phrasing A              | Phrasing B                     | Notes                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| "Perfect audio quality" | "The audio quality is perfect" | May produce different tonal qualities |
| "Speaking quickly"      | "A fast pace"                  | Affects rhythm differently            |
| "Deep voice"            | "His voice is deep"            | Contextual vs standalone descriptor   |
| "Thick accent"          | "A very pronounced accent"     | Intensity perception varies           |

**Best Practice:** When iterating on a voice, try rephrasing key descriptors
rather than just adding more details. Small wording changes can unlock the exact
voice you're looking for.

## Core Attributes Reference

### Age Descriptors

| Descriptor                 | Effect                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Adolescent                 | Youthful, higher energy |
| Young adult / in their 20s | Fresh, vibrant          |
| Middle-aged / in their 40s | Mature, experienced     |
| Elderly / in their 80s     | Weathered, wise         |

### Tone/Timbre Descriptors

| Category | Options                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Depth    | Deep, low-pitched, booming, resonant    |
| Texture  | Smooth, gravelly, raspy, breathy, airy  |
| Quality  | Warm, mellow, rich, buttery             |
| Edge     | Nasally, shrill, harsh, tinny, metallic |
| Special  | Ethereal, robotic, throaty              |

### Pacing Descriptors

| Speed    | Descriptors                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fast     | Speaking quickly, fast-paced, hurried cadence, staccato |
| Normal   | Normal pace, conversational, relaxed pacing             |
| Slow     | Speaking slowly, deliberate, measured, drawn out        |
| Variable | Erratic pacing, rhythmic, musical                       |

### Accent Guidance

**Use "thick" for prominent accents, "slight" for subtle:**

- "A middle-aged man with a thick French accent"
- "A young woman with a slight Southern drawl"
- "An old man with a heavy Eastern European accent"

**Avoid:** "foreign", "exotic" (too vague)

**For fantasy characters, reference real accents:**

- "An elf with a proper thick British accent. He is regal and lyrical."
- "A goblin with a raspy Eastern European accent."

## Technical Parameters

### Guidance Scale Settings

| Scenario                      | Guidance Scale | Notes                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Accent/tone accuracy critical | 35-40%         | Higher adherence to prompt |
| Balanced quality + accuracy   | 25-30%         | Good middle ground         |
| Performance quality priority  | 15-25%         | More creative freedom      |
| Very niche/specific prompts   | Lower (20%)    | Prevents audio artifacts   |

### Loudness Control

Controls the volume level of preview generation and saved voice output.

| Setting         | Use Case                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Higher loudness | Energetic voices, announcers, shouting characters    |
| Default/medium  | Most conversational voices                           |
| Lower loudness  | Soft-spoken characters, whispers, intimate narration |

**Tip:** Adjust loudness to match the character's energy level. A drill sergeant
should be louder than a meditation guide.

## Preview Text Best Practices

1. **Match emotional tone** - Preview text should complement the voice
   description
2. **Use longer text** - Full sentences or paragraphs produce more stable
   results
3. **Avoid contradictions** - Don't use aggressive text for a calm voice
   description

**Bad pairing:**

> Voice: "calm and reflective younger female voice" Preview: "Hey! I can't stand
> what you've done!!!"

**Good pairing:**

> Voice: "calm and reflective younger female voice" Preview: "It's been quiet
> lately... I've had time to think, and maybe that's what I needed most."

## Special Effects in Preview Text

Use these in preview text for expressive delivery:

- `[laughs]` - Laughter
- `[sighs]` - Sighs
- `[exhales]` - Exhale
- `[lip smacks]` - Lip smack
- `(maniacal laughter)` - Parenthetical actions

## Common Voice Archetypes

| Archetype          | Key Prompt Elements                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Sports Commentator | High-energy, thick accent, quick pace, enthusiastic |
| Drill Sergeant     | Angry, fast pace, shouting, authoritative           |
| Movie Trailer      | Dramatic, builds anticipation, deep, resonant       |
| Friendly Narrator  | Warm, conversational pace, approachable             |
| Evil Villain       | Deep, resonant, slow, menacing                      |
| Cute Character     | Squeaky, high-pitched, playful                      |

## Key Reminders

1. **More detail = better accuracy** for specific characters
2. **Simple prompts work** for generic/neutral voices
3. **"thick" > "strong"** for accent prominence
4. **Preview text matters** - match it to your voice description
5. **Longer preview text = more stable** voice generation
6. **Guidance scale tradeoff:** Higher = more accurate but potential quality
   loss
7. **Experiment with phrasing** - same concept, different words can produce
   different results
8. **Adjust loudness** to match character energy level
