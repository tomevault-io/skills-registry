# Skill Author

Create a new skill or refine an existing one. Skills are task starters, not role primers.

## Inputs

- Creating or updating an existing skill?
- Command name (hyphenated, e.g. `skill-author`)
- 1-2 sentence goal (what the user wants done)
- What triggers this skill (when should it be chosen over others?)

## Workflow

1. **Define scope** — What this skill does and what it explicitly does not do. Link to AGENTS.md for project facts; do not duplicate them.

2. **Choose metadata** — `name`: hyphenated. `description`: short plain text, no extra `:` characters.

3. **Write SKILL.md** to `.aide/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`:
   - YAML frontmatter: `name` + `description` only
   - Task definition (not role framing — no "Documentation Loading (role-based)" sections)
   - **Inputs** section
   - **Workflow** section (numbered, deterministic steps)
   - **Reference** section only if linking to a real file that must exist
   - Target: 30-50 lines total

4. **Add bundled resources only if they pay for themselves** — `scripts/` for deterministic execution, no extra READMEs inside the skill folder.

5. **Install** — Run `.aide/skills/install-claude.ps1`. Reload tool UI and confirm `/skill-name` appears.

## Authoring checklist

- Frontmatter is valid YAML
- `description` has no extra `:` characters
- Steps are actionable (no hand-wavy language)
- No references to deleted primer files
- File is 30-50 lines
