# Docs Tracker - Automatic Documentation System

## Purpose

This skill automates documentation maintenance:

- **Detects** modified files via git diff
- **Compares** with existing documentation
- **Creates** docs for new files
- **Updates** docs for modified files
- **Removes** docs for deleted files
- **Generates** automatic changelog

---

## Execution Flow

```
1. DETECT CHANGES → git diff --name-status
        ↓
2. CLASSIFY CHANGES → A=Added, M=Modified, D=Deleted
        ↓
3. CHECK EXISTING DOCS → docs/, codebase-knowledge/domains/
        ↓
4. EXECUTE ACTIONS → Create, update, or remove docs
```

---

## Detection Commands

### Changes Since Last Commit

```bash
git diff --name-status HEAD~1
```

### Changes vs Main

```bash
git diff --name-status main..HEAD
```

### Added Files

```bash
git diff --name-status main..HEAD | grep "^A"
```

### Modified Files

```bash
git diff --name-status main..HEAD | grep "^M"
```

### Deleted Files

```bash
git diff --name-status main..HEAD | grep "^D"
```

### Detailed File Diff

```bash
git diff main..HEAD -- path/to/file.ts
```

## File → Doc Mapping

| File Type             | Related Documentation                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `server/routers/*.ts` | `codebase-knowledge/domains/[domain].md`      |
| `server/models/*.ts`  | `codebase-knowledge/domains/[domain].md`      |
| `app/**/page.tsx`     | `docs/flows/[feature].md`                     |
| `components/**/*.tsx` | `docs/components/[component].md` (if complex) |
| `lib/**/*.ts`         | `docs/utils/[lib].md` (if exported)           |
