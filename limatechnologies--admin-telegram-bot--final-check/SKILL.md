# Final Check - Final Validation System

## VETO POWER

> **WARNING:** This skill HAS VETO POWER.
> If rule violated, MUST:
>
> 1. STOP and list violations
> 2. REQUIRE fix before approving
> 3. Re-validate after fixes

---

## Purpose

This skill is the LAST check before task completion:

- **Validates** all CLAUDE.md rules
- **Verifies** all skills were consulted
- **Confirms** documentation was updated
- **Ensures** nothing was forgotten
- **Blocks** incomplete tasks

### Vetoed

```markdown
## FINAL CHECK - VETOED

### Task Summary

- **Type:** Feature
- **Domain:** [domain]

### Violations Found

#### ❌ Codebase-Knowledge

- **Violation:** Domain NOT updated after implementation
- **Action:** Update domain file with commit hash

#### ❌ Test-Coverage

- **Violation:** New file without test
- **File:** `components/NewComponent.tsx`
- **Action:** Create E2E spec

**STATUS: VETOED** - 2 violations. Fix before commit.

### Next Steps

## VETO Rules

### IMMEDIATE VETO

1. Security-scan found critical vulnerability
2. Quality-gate doesn't pass
3. Tests failing
4. Codebase-knowledge not updated

### VETO BEFORE MERGE

1. Docs not updated
2. Skeleton missing (if new component)
3. Changelog not updated

### WARNING (No veto)

1. Coverage below ideal (but critical tests exist)
2. Optional docs missing
