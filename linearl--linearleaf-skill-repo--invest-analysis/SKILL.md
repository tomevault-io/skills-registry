### 🚀 Project Initialization (开始前必做)

**Before starting any analysis, complete the following setup**:

1. **Create Project Directory**:
   ```powershell
   # Create project folder with descriptive name
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "AI芯片_2026Q1"
   cd "AI芯片_2026Q1"
   
   # Create all subdirectories
   @('step1', 'step2', 'step2.5', 'step3', 'step3/financials', 'step3/extracts', 
     'step3/analysis', 'step3/report', 'step3.5', 'step3.5/verify', 'step3.5/report',
     'step3.6', 'step4', 'step4/raw_data', 'step4/classified', 'step4/analysis', 
     'step4/report', 'step5', 'step5/raw_data', 'step5/analysis', 'step5/report',
     'step6', 'step6/reports', 'step6/analysis', 'step6/report',

   code checklist.md
   ```

3. **Initialize Checklist**:
   - Fill in project name, date, analyst name
   - Review directory structure
   - Mark "目录创建完成" checkbox

**⚠️ Critical**: The checklist is your single source of truth for tracking progress. Update it after EVERY step completion.

---

### Phase 1: Sector Selection (Step1 - 赛道筛选)

**Objective**: Use AI's information breadth to identify short-term opportunity sectors based on upcoming events (conferences, policies, seasonal factors).

**Process**:
1. Gather context about current market environment
2. Identify upcoming catalysts (1-2 months outlook based on conferences, policies, seasonal events)
3. Rank 3-5 sectors by importance and certainty
4. Extract core investment thesis (催化逻辑) for each sector
5. Identify 1-2 leading stocks as references per sector

**Output**:
- Document: `01_赛道筛选_YYYYQx_A股或港股潜在爆发行情.md`
- Directory: `step1/`

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Is the catalyst source明确?
- ✅ Are representative leading stocks provided?
- ✅ Is the ranking logic explained?

**Recommended Models**: DeepSeek, Gemini Deep Research, ChatGPT

**📋 Checklist Update**: After completing Step1, update `checklist.md`:
- ✅ Mark Step1 file as complete
- Fill in "关键发现" (筛选赛道, 核心催化, 时间窗口)
- Mark "Step1完成" and perform quality check

### Phase 2: Supply Chain Analysis (Step2 - 产业链挖掘)

**Objective**: After identifying target sector, drill down to specific supply chain segments and high-value components (找铲子).

**Process**:
1. Create separate analysis for each sector from Step1
2. Decompose sector into core supply chain components
3. Identify segments with highest value contribution (价值量最高处)
4. Find A-share leaders in each segment
5. Discover "picks and shovels" stocks (铲子股 - universal suppliers)
6. Map competitive landscape and backup candidates

**Output**:
- Documents: `02A~02E_产业链挖掘_{赛道}_YYYYQx.md` (one per sector)
- Stock list: `step2/02_标的清单.yaml` (fields: name, track, code, market)
  - A股: `market: A`, `code`=6 digits
  - 港股: `market: HK`, `code`=5 digits (keep leading zeros)
- Directory: `step2/`

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Does it include key segments/value contribution/picks-and-shovels analysis?
- ✅ Are A-share leaders and backups provided?
- ✅ Is the YAML stock list generated for downstream steps?

**📋 Checklist Update**: After completing Step2, update `checklist.md`:
- ✅ Mark all Step2 files as complete
- Fill in "关键发现" (价值量最高环节, 铲子股, 候选股票数)
- **Critical**: Verify YAML format is correct - all subsequent steps depend on this!
- Mark "Step2完成" and perform quality check

### Phase 2.5: Commodity Cycle Positioning (Step2.5 - 商品周期定位 - 资源股必做)

**Objective**: For commodity/resource sectors, identify current position in supply-demand cycle and price cycle to avoid buying at cycle peaks.

**⚠️ Critical Lesson from Real Cases**:
```
白银踏空案例(2025年11月):
- 判断: 结构性牛市中段(56美元/盎司) ✓ 正确
- 策略: 等待回调到52-55美元 ✗ 错误
- 结果: 价格未回调,直接涨到60+ → 完全踏空

教训: 牛市不言顶,逼空不言调
→ 周期定位比静态价格更重要
```

**Process**:
1. **Supply-Demand Fundamentals (5 Key Indicators)**:
   - **Capacity**: Is production capacity at ceiling? (e.g., 铝行业4500万吨天花板)
   - **Inventory**: Current inventory level vs historical percentile (<30% = tight supply)
   - **Utilization Rate**: Operating rate trend (rising = demand strong)
   - **Price Trend**: Is price rising/stable/falling? Duration of trend?
   - **Order Backlog**: Are orders piling up or slowing down?

2. **Cycle Stage Identification (4 Stages)**:
   - **Stage 1 - Bottom (底部)**: Low price, high inventory, low utilization → **Best entry**
   - **Stage 2 - Uptrend (上升)**: Price rising, inventory falling, capacity tight → **Good entry**
   - **Stage 3 - Frenzy (狂热)**: Extreme price, zero inventory, everyone bullish → **Reduce position**
   - **Stage 4 - Collapse (崩塌)**: Price falling, inventory rising, demand gone → **Exit**

3. **Current Position Assessment**:
   - Which stage is current commodity in? (Evidence from Step1 catalyst + supply-demand data)
   - How long has current stage lasted? (Cycles typically 3-5 years)
   - What's the expected duration remaining? (Conservative estimate)

4. **Price Cycle vs Production Cycle Mismatch**:
   - **Key Insight**: Production capacity takes 2-3 years to build, price can spike in months
   - **Opportunity Window**: Identify when supply is constrained but price hasn't peaked
   - **Example**: 铝行业2025-2026Q2 window (国内产能天花板 + 海外产能未释放)

**Output**:
- Cycle analysis: `step2.5/02.5_{赛道}_商品周期定位.md`
- Fields: Current stage, supply-demand indicators, investment window, risk triggers
- Directory: `step2.5/`

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Have you identified current cycle stage with evidence?
- ✅ Are supply-demand fundamentals quantified (not just qualitative)?
- ✅ Is the investment window timeframe specified?
- ✅ Are risk triggers defined (what would signal cycle turning)?

**Decision Impact**:
- 🟢 **Stage 1-2 (Bottom/Uptrend)**: Aggressive position building, cycle has years to run
- 🟡 **Stage 2-3 (Uptrend/Frenzy)**: Selective entry, use 3-3-4 staged method, set tight stops
- 🔴 **Stage 3-4 (Frenzy/Collapse)**: Reduce/exit positions, cycle peaking or peaked

**📋 Checklist Update**: After completing Step2.5 (if applicable), update `checklist.md`:
- ✅ Mark Step2.5 file as complete OR mark as "⊗ (非资源股跳过)"
- Fill in "关键判断" (周期阶段, 投资窗口, 风险触发点)
- Mark "Step2.5完成" and perform quality check

**🎯 Phase 1 Milestone Check**: Before proceeding to Step3, review checklist:
- [ ] All sectors have supply chain analysis?
- [ ] YAML format validated?
- [ ] Resource stocks completed cycle positioning?

**⚠️ Avoid These Mistakes**:
- ❌ Waiting for "perfect pullback" in Stage 2 uptrend → Risk of踏空 (missing opportunity)
- ❌ Buying dips in Stage 4 collapse → "Catching falling knife"
- ❌ Using historical PE in Stage 2-3 → Cycle PE adjustment needed (see Step3c)

### Phase 3: Fundamental Verification (Step3 - 深度去伪/财报验证)

**Objective**: Validate investment thesis through financial reports and business fundamentals, distinguish real business from speculation. Separated into 3 layers: automated download/extraction and manual analysis.

#### Step3a: Financial Report Download (财报获取 - 自动化)

**Objective**: Automatically download annual and quarterly reports for all stocks from Step2.

**Process**:
1. Read `step2/02_标的清单.yaml` for stock codes
2. Use CNINFO API to download latest annual/quarterly reports (A-share only)
3. Save reports as PDF files by stock code
4. For HK stocks, manually download from HKEXnews or company IR pages and place into the same directory structure

**Output**:
- Directory: `step3/financials/{代码_名称}/`
- Contents: `{年份}_annual_report.pdf`, `{季度}_quarterly_report.pdf`

**Tools** (automation):
- Download script: `step3/tools/step3a_download_reports.py`
- Config: Input `step2/02_标的清单.yaml`

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Are all reports for Step2 stocks downloaded?
- ✅ Are reports organized by stock code and year/quarter?
- ✅ Are missing reports logged for manual intervention?

#### Step3b: Financial Report Content Extraction (财报内容提取 - 自动化)

**Objective**: Extract key sections from downloaded reports using AI or OCR for structured analysis.

**Process**:
1. Read PDF reports from `step3/financials/`
2. Extract key sections: 产品分类、主要客户、订单信息、风险因素、收入和毛利
3. Generate extraction summaries with timestamps
4. Create searchable index for manual review

**Output**:
- Extracts: `step3/extracts/{代码_名称}_annual_extract.txt`, `quarterly_extract.txt`
- Index: `step3/extracts/extraction_index.yaml` (fields: code, name, sections, extraction_date)
- Directory: `step3/extracts/`

**Tools** (automation):
- Extraction script: `step3/tools/step3b_extract_content.py`
- Supports: PDF text extraction, structured data parsing
- Config: Rules for section identification

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Are key sections extracted for all reports?
- ✅ Is extracted content organized and searchable?
- ✅ Are extraction timestamps recorded?

#### Step3c: Financial Report Analysis & Verification (财报分析 - 全AI自动)

**Objective**: Automatically analyze extracted financial report content using AI to verify business fundamentals and identify red flags. Complete end-to-end without human intervention.

**Process** (Fully Automated with AI):
1. **AI Content Analysis**: 
   - Read "产品分类" section: Determine if new business is substantial or just R&D
   - Read "主要客户" section: Extract real customer names and order volumes
   - Read "风险因素" section: Identify hidden risks or competitive threats
2. **AI Evidence Extraction**:
   - Evidence-based findings: Cite specific report sections and numbers
   - Risk identification: Extract top 3-5 risks with supporting evidence
   - Business assessment: Classify business as "real", "trial", or "speculation"
3. **Resource Moat Rating (资源护城河评级 - 20% weight)** ⭐ NEW:
   - **5 points**: Global/national monopoly (中国铀业, 盐湖股份97%钾盐)
   - **4 points**: Global top 3 (洛阳钼业钴, 紫金矿业铜金)
   - **3 points**: Regional monopoly (某省某矿独占)
   - **2 points**: Has resources but non-monopoly
   - **1 point**: No resources (pure processing/tech, 汇顶科技)
   - **Key Principle**: 资源垄断 > 技术垄断 > 市场占有率 > 品牌客户关系
4. **Cycle-Adjusted PE (周期PE调整 - for resource/commodity stocks)** ⭐ NEW:
   - Traditional PE = Price / Current EPS (can be misleading at cycle peaks/troughs)
   - **Cycle PE** = Price / Peak Cycle EPS (normalized earnings)
   - **PEG** = PE / Growth Rate (<1 = undervalued, >2 = overvalued)
   - Example: 云铝 PE=22.82 seems high, but PEG=0.91 → actually undervalued
5. **AI Report Generation**: Automatically generate individual analysis reports per stock
6. **AI Summary Table Creation**: Generate consolidated verification table

**Key Advantages of AI-Only Approach**:
- ✅ **Consistency**: Same analysis criteria applied to all stocks
- ✅ **Speed**: All stocks analyzed in parallel, results in minutes
- ✅ **Completeness**: No risk of human oversight or fatigue bias
- ✅ **Traceability**: All conclusions backed by specific evidence references
- ✅ **Scalability**: Can handle 10-100+ stocks without time constraints

**Output**:
- Individual Reports: `step3/analysis/03_{赛道}_{代码}_{名称}.md`
- Summary Table: `step3/report/03_汇总_结论表.md`
  - Fields: Code, Name, Track, Business Reality Score, Key Risks, Revenue Proportion, AI Recommendation
- Detailed Evidence: Each report includes specific evidence references
- Directory: `step3/`

**Tools** (Fully Automated):
- No manual scripts needed - use Claude/GPT directly
- Input: Step3b extracted content (plain text files)
- Output: Structured markdown reports

**Prompts to Use**:
```
请根据以下财报摘要信息，分析这家公司的业务真实性:

### Phase 3.5: Supply Chain Verification (Step3.5 - 产业链验证 - 可选但推荐)

**Objective**: Cross-validate Step2's supply chain assumptions using evidence from financial reports and news events. Identify if assumed relationships actually exist in the market.

**Process**:
1. **Financial Report Cross-Check**: 
   - Review Step3c extracted content for customer/supplier relationships
   - Does Company A (identified as supplier in Step2) mention Company B (identified as customer) in their reports?
   - Are order volumes and cooperation status mentioned?
   - Red flag: Assumed relationship but no mutual mention in reports
2. **News Event Verification**:
   - Check Step4 news for partnership announcements between Step2 companies
   - Validate if supply chain relationships have been publicly announced
   - Identify new partnerships not covered in Step2 analysis
3. **Competitive Threat Assessment**:
   - Are there alternative suppliers or competitors emerging?
   - Has any Step2 company lost market share to new entrants?
   - Identify potential disruption to the assumed supply chain structure
4. **Supply Chain Risk Mapping**:
   - Identify bottleneck positions (single supplier or customer dependency)
   - Assess concentration risk: If key company fails, does entire chain collapse?

**Output**:
- Verification report: `step3.5/report/03.5_供应链验证表.md`
- Fields: Company, Role, Assumed Relationships, Evidence Found, Confidence Level, Risks
- Risk mapping: `step3.5/report/03.5_供应链风险地图.md`
- Directory: `step3.5/`

**Tools** (optional automation):
- Verification script: `step3.5/tools/step3.5_supply_chain_verify.py`
- Input: Step2 supply chain structure + Step3c analysis reports + Step4 news data

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Are supply chain relationships verified with evidence from financial reports?
- ✅ Have you identified companies mentioned in Step2 but without actual business relationships?
- ✅ Are bottleneck positions clearly marked?
- ✅ Is the confidence level for each relationship documented?

**Impact on Decision**:
- 🔴 Low confidence supply chain → Reduce investment conviction or wait for clearer validation
- 🟡 Moderate confidence → Proceed but monitor news for relationship confirmation
- 🟢 High confidence → Thesis strengthened, ready for Step4 analysis

### Phase 3.6: Geopolitical Risk Assessment (Step3.6 - 地缘风险评估 - 资源股/全球供应链必做)

**Objective**: Systematically assess geopolitical risks for resource stocks and global supply chain exposure.

**⚠️ Critical Context - Deglobalization Revaluation**:
```
传统逻辑(全球化时代):
海外资产 = 风险 → 折价10-20%
鹏欣刚果金矿 → 地缘风险 → 低估

新逻辑(去全球化时代):
海外资产 = 稀缺性 → 溢价20-40%
鹏欣刚果金矿 → 铜钴稀缺 → 战略重估

前提条件:
✓ 供应链中断风险上升
✓ 资源民族主义抬头  
✓ 手握资源即定价权
```

**Process**:
1. **Supply Chain Geopolitics (50% weight)**:
   - Where do critical raw materials come from? (Country/region)
   - Is there sanction risk? (US/EU blacklist, export controls)
   - Are there alternative suppliers? (Backup plan feasibility)
   - **Example**: 中芯国际 DUV光刻机 → 荷兰ASML → 美国制裁风险

2. **Customer Geopolitics (30% weight)**:
   - Where are major customers located? (Concentration by country)
   - Over-reliance on single country? (>50% revenue from one country = high risk)
   - Deglobalization impact? (友岸外包/supply chain bifurcation)
   - **Example**: 某AI芯片公司 → 100%美国客户 → 高风险

3. **Asset Geopolitics (20% weight)**:
   - Percentage of overseas assets? (<20% safe, >50% high risk)
   - Political stability of host country? (Past 10 years: coups, wars, riots)
   - Nationalization risk? (Mining royalty changes, asset seizure)
   - **Example**: 鹏欣资源刚果(金) → 政局不稳 → 资产国有化风险

**Scoring System**:
- **0-3 points**: Extreme geopolitical risk (鹏欣刚果金, 某俄罗斯资产公司)
  - Action: Satellite position only (<10%), strict stop-loss
- **4-6 points**: Moderate geopolitical risk (中芯国际DUV, 洛阳钼业刚果钴)
  - Action: Normal position with hedging strategy
- **7-10 points**: Low geopolitical risk (中国铝业国内, 盐湖股份国内)
  - Action: Core position eligible (30-40%)

**Deglobalization Adjustment (去全球化视角重估)** ⭐:
- If geopolitical risk = resource scarcity opportunity:
  - **Add +1.5 points**: For strategic resources in conflict zones (铜钴锂稀土)
  - **Add +1.0 points**: For import substitution beneficiaries (国产替代)
- If geopolitical risk = pure political chaos:
  - **Deduct -1.0 to -2.0 points**: For unstable regions without strategic value

**Example Applications**:
```
鹏欣资源:
基础分 3.0 (刚果金极高风险)
地缘溢价 +1.5 (铜钴战略稀缺)
政局折价 -1.0 (政变罢工风险)
调整后 3.5 → 卫星仓10-15%, 严格止损

洛阳钼业:
基础分 5.0 (刚果金+国内混合)
地缘溢价 +1.5 (全球第一钴)
国企背书 +0.5 (央企降低没收风险)
调整后 7.0 → 核心仓20-30%

中国铝业:
基础分 8.0 (主要国内+几内亚)
资源稀缺 +1.0 (几内亚铝土矿战略)
调整后 9.0 → 核心仓30-40%
```

**Output**:
- Geopolitical analysis: `step3.6/03.6_地缘风险评估表.md`
- Fields: Company, Supply Risk, Customer Risk, Asset Risk, Total Score, Deglobalization Adjustment, Position Limit
- Directory: `step3.6/`

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Have you identified all overseas exposure (supply/customer/asset)?
- ✅ Is political stability assessed with evidence (past conflicts/policy changes)?
- ✅ Have you applied deglobalization lens (risk vs opportunity)?
- ✅ Are position limits set based on geopolitical score?

**📋 Checklist Update**: After completing Step3.6 (if applicable), update `checklist.md`:
- ✅ Mark Step3.6 file as complete OR mark as "⊗ (国内产业链跳过)"
- Fill in "关键判断" (极高风险股票, 仓位限制, 去全球化受益股)
- Mark "Step3.6完成" and perform quality check

**🎯 Phase 2 Milestone Check**: Before proceeding to Step4, review checklist:
- [ ] All candidate stocks have financial analysis?
- [ ] Business reality scores completed?
- [ ] Supply chain verification completed?
- [ ] Geopolitical risk assessment completed (if applicable)?
- [ ] Low-score/high-risk stocks eliminated?

### Phase 4: News & Events Analysis (Step4 - 消息与新闻检索)

**Objective**: Discover catalysts and risks through systematic news and event analysis.

#### Step4a: News Search & Collection (新闻搜索 - 自动化)

**Objective**: Automatically search and collect announcements, news, and events from multiple sources.

**Process**:
1. Search CNINFO (巨潮资讯) for official announcements from A-share stocks
2. For HK stocks, collect announcements from HKEXnews or company IR pages (manual if needed)
3. Search news platforms for industry news and company news (past 30-60 days)
4. Search event calendars for conferences, earnings announcements, policy releases
5. Collect metadata: source, date, title, URL
6. De-duplicate and organize by date

**Output**:
- Raw news collection: `step4/raw_data/{代码_名称}_news_raw.yaml`
- Fields: date, source, title, url, category (announcement/news/event)
- News index: `step4/raw_data/news_index.yaml`
- Directory: `step4/raw_data/`

**Tools** (automation):
- Search script: `step4/tools/step4a_search_news.py`
- Supports: CNINFO API, news APIs, web scraping
- Config: Search keywords from Step2 stock names

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Are all Step2 stocks covered in news search?
- ✅ Is the time window correct (30-60 days)?
- ✅ Are duplicate news items removed?

#### Step4b: News Classification & Tagging (新闻分类与标注 - AI + 人工)

**Objective**: Classify news into catalysts and risks, and tag relevance and impact.

**Process**:
1. **AI-Assisted Classification**:
   - Use AI to read news titles and summaries
   - Classify: Positive Catalyst / Negative Risk / Neutral News / Irrelevant
   - Extract key entities: Company affected, event type, impact area
2. **Human Validation**:
   - Review AI classifications for accuracy
   - Correct misclassifications
   - Add manual notes for ambiguous cases
3. **Time Window Tagging**:
   - When did the event occur? (event_date)
   - When will impact be realized? (impact_date)
   - Any upcoming milestones mentioned? (milestone_date)
4. **Impact Assessment**:
   - High Impact: Could significantly change investment thesis
   - Medium Impact: Notable but not thesis-changing
   - Low Impact: Routine or minor news

**Output**:
- Classified news: `step4/classified/{代码_名称}_news_classified.yaml`
- Fields: date, source, title, classification, impact_level, event_date, impact_date, notes, reviewed
- Summary table: `step4/report/04_汇总_新闻分类表.md`
- Directory: `step4/classified/`

**Tools** (AI assistance):
- Classification script: `step4/tools/step4b_classify_news.py`
- Input: Raw news from Step4a
- Output format: Structured YAML

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Have you reviewed AI classifications for accuracy?
- ✅ Are impact levels assigned based on thesis relevance?
- ✅ Are all dates clearly documented?
- ✅ Are ambiguous news items marked for human review?

#### Step4c: News-Technical Conflict Check (新闻与技术面冲突检查)

**Objective**: Cross-check if news timeline aligns with technical analysis to identify inconsistencies.

**Process**:
1. **Timeline Analysis**:
   - Major positive catalyst → Did stock price rise after announcement? If not, red flag
   - Major negative risk → Did stock price fall after announcement? If not, red flag
   - Upcoming catalyst → Is stock price already pricing in expectation?
2. **Conflict Detection**:
   - Stock already rallied 50% but catalyst still 1 month away → Overheating risk
   - Negative news announced but stock price unchanged → Market disagrees, investigate why
   - Gap between news date and stock reaction → Possible delayed impact
3. **Validation Gaps**:
   - Which news items don't match the technical trend?
   - Are there hidden catalysts not captured in news search?
4. **Final News Summary**:
   - List catalysts with timeline and confidence level
   - Highlight conflicts and their implications
   - Recommend: Watch for upcoming catalyst dates, avoid trading before announcements

**Output**:
- Conflict analysis: `step4/analysis/04_新闻技术面冲突分析.md`
- Final news summary: `step4/report/04_汇总_新闻与事件表.md`
- Fields: Stock, Event Type, Event Date, Expected Impact Date, News Catalyst, Technical Signal, Alignment, Risk Notes
- Directory: `step4/`

**Tools** (AI + manual analysis):
- Helper script: `step4/tools/step4c_conflict_check.py` (optional)
- Input: Step4b classified news + Step5a technical data
- Output: Conflict report and recommendations

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Are major catalysts aligned with technical trends?
- ✅ Have you identified conflicts and their implications?

- Fill in "关键发现" (新闻与价格冲突股, 已price-in催化, 未来催化时间表)
- Mark "Step4c完成" and perform quality check

**🎯 Phase 3 Milestone Check**: Before proceeding to Step5, review checklist:
- [ ] All stocks have news search completed?
- [ ] Catalyst timeline is clear?
- [ ] News-technical conflicts investigated?

**Objective**: Search for recent announcements, news, and events to identify catalysts and risks.

### Phase 5: Technical Analysis & Entry Strategy (Step5 - 技术面走势与介入策略)

**Objective**: Combine fundamental and news analysis with technical analysis to formulate final entry strategy.

#### Step5a: Technical Data Collection & Indicator Calculation (技术数据获取与指标计算 - 自动化)

**Objective**: Automatically collect historical price data and calculate technical indicators.

**Process**:
1. Retrieve recent 120 trading days' price data for all stocks
2. Calculate moving averages: MA20, MA60, MA250
3. Calculate high/low points: 20-day/60-day/250-day high and low
4. Calculate volatility metrics: ATR, daily range, amplitude
5. Organize data into time-indexed format

**Output**:
- Technical data: `step5/raw_data/{代码_名称}_technical_data.csv`
- Columns: date, open, close, high, low, volume, ma20, ma60, ma250, h20, l20, h60, l60, h250, l250
- Data index: `step5/raw_data/technical_index.yaml`

**Tools** (automation):
- Data collection script: `step5/tools/step5a_fetch_technical_data.py`
- Supports: Wind API, Tushare, Yahoo Finance
- Config: Stock codes from Step2 YAML

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Are all 120 trading days of data collected?
- ✅ Are all indicators calculated correctly?
- ✅ Are data gaps handled (holidays, missing data)?

#### Step5b: Trend Analysis & Signal Detection (趋势判断与信号检测 - AI + 人工)

**Objective**: Analyze price trends and identify technical signals aligned with fundamental and news analysis.

**Process**:
1. **Trend Assessment** ⭐:
   - Short-term (20-day): Is price above/below MA20? Momentum direction?
   - Medium-term (60-day): Is price above/below MA60? Established trend?
   - Long-term (250-day): Is price above/below MA250? Overall trend?
   - Trend health: Are MAs in proper order (MA20 > MA60 > MA250 for uptrend)?
2. **Support & Resistance**:
   - Recent support: 20-day low, 60-day low
   - Potential resistance: 20-day high, 60-day high, previous highs
   - Breakout zones: If price breaks 60-day high, where's next resistance?
3. **Volatility & Risk**:
   - Average daily range and amplitude
   - Recent volatility vs historical average (high volatility = risk)
   - Gap risk: Overnight gaps that could stop-loss?
4. **Signal Validation with Fundamentals & News**:
   - Does uptrend align with positive catalysts (Step4)?
   - Does downtrend align with negative risks (Step4)?
   - Conflict detection: Stock rallying but negative news → Be cautious
   - Wait for signals: Is price still waiting for announced catalyst?
5. **AI-Generated Signal Report**:
   - Use AI to synthesize: fundamentals + news + technical signals
   - Highlight alignment and conflicts
   - Estimate confidence level for each signal

**Output**:
- Technical analysis: `step5/analysis/05_{赛道}_{代码}_{名称}_technical.md`
- Signal summary: `step5/report/05_汇总_技术信号表.md`
- Fields: Stock, Short-term Trend, Mid-term Trend, Support, Resistance, Signal Strength, Catalyst Alignment, Risk Level
- Directory: `step5/analysis/`

**Tools** (AI assistance):
- Analysis helper: `step5/tools/step5b_trend_analysis.py` (optional)
- Input: Technical data from Step5a + catalyst timeline from Step4c
- Output: Signal report with recommendations

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Have you assessed trends at multiple timeframes?
- ✅ Are support/resistance levels clearly identified?
- ✅ Is technical signal aligned with fundamental analysis?
- ✅ Are conflicts with news catalysts documented?

#### Step5c: Entry Decision & Strategy Formulation (入场决策与策略制定)

**Objective**: Make final investment decision based on integrated analysis (fundamentals + news + technical).

**Process**:
1. **Integrated Assessment**:
   - Step3c: Is business fundamentally sound? (Business Reality Score: 1-10)
   - Step4c: Are catalysts positive and upcoming? (Catalyst Timeline)
   - Step5b: Is technical setup favorable for entry? (Trend & Signal Quality)
   - Step3.5: Is supply chain thesis validated? (Confidence Level)

2. **Decision Matrix**:
   | Business | Catalyst | Technical | Supply Chain | **Action** |
   |----------|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
   | Bullish | Positive | Strong Up | High Conf | **BUY** |
   | Bullish | Positive | Neutral | High Conf | **WAIT for Setup** |
   | Bullish | Neutral | Strong Up | High Conf | **Consider BUY** |
   | Bullish | Negative | Strong Down | High Conf | **WAIT** |
   | Neutral | Positive | Strong Up | Mod Conf | **Monitor** |
   | Bearish | Any | Any | Low Conf | **AVOID** |

3. **Price Target & Risk Management - 3-3-4 Staged Position Building (分批建仓法)** ⭐ NEW:

**⚠️ Critical Lesson - Avoid Complete 踏空 (Missing Opportunity)**:
```
传统错误(等完美买点 = 100%踏空风险):
"等云铝回调12% (32.84→28.80) → 永远等不到 → 仓位0%"
"等白银回调到52-55 → 价格直接60+ → 完全踏空"

问题: 战略看对(牛市逼空) vs 战术执行(等深度回调) → 逻辑割裂
```

**3-3-4 Method (替代传统一次性满仓)**:

**第一批 30%: 现价立即买入 (获取观察权)**
- **Purpose**: Avoid complete踏空, get "skin in the game"
- **When**: Immediately after thesis validated (Step3+4+5 all green)
- **Price**: Current market price (不等回调)
- **Psychological benefit**: 有底仓 → 不焦虑 → 决策更理性
- **Example**: 白银56美元时买30% → 即使涨到60也有底仓,不会完全踏空

**第二批 30%: 挂单5-8%回调 (灵活防守)**
- **Purpose**: Capture pullback if it happens, lower average cost
- **When**: Set limit order 5-8% below current price
- **Rule**: If not filled within 3-5 days → **Cancel order, give up**
- **Key**: Don't stubbornly wait for 10-15% deep pullback (龙头在高景气期"以横代跌")
- **Example**: 云铝32.84时挂28.80(-12%) → 永远等不到 → 应该挂30.50(-7%)并设3天期限

**第三批 40%: 突破前高追加 (右侧确认)**
- **Purpose**: Confirm uptrend strength, ride momentum
- **When**: Price breaks above 20-day or 60-day high on volume
- **Validation**: Must have catalyst confirmation (news/earnings/policy)
- **Psychological**: Overcome "fear of heights" (30元PE=20 < 3元PE=100, 30元更便宜)
- **Example**: 白银突破60美元 + ETF持续流入 → 追加40%, 周期未结束

**Dynamic Stop-Loss (移动止损 - 替代固定止损)**:
- ❌ **Traditional fixed stop**: Entry price -10% (会被正常波动震出)
- ✅ **Moving stop** (2 options):
  - **Option 1**: 20-day MA trailing stop (保护利润,让盈利奔跑)
  - **Option 2**: ATR 2x trailing stop (adaptive to volatility)
- **Example**: 买入10元 → 涨到15元 → 止损线从9元上移到13.5元(20日均线)

**Position Sizing by Conviction**:
- 🎯 **High Conviction** (3 factors aligned): 30%+30%+40% = **Full 3-3-4**
- 🟡 **Medium Conviction** (2 factors aligned): 20%+20%+0% = **40% max**
- 🔴 **Low Conviction** (1 factor only): 10%+0%+0% = **10% starter only**

4. **Psychological Trap Warnings (心理陷阱警示系统)** ⚠️ NEW:

**Trap 1: "Fear of Heights" (恐高心理)**
- **Symptom**: "30元太贵不敢买, 3元便宜敢追高"
- **Reality**: 30元 PE=20倍 < 3元 PE=100倍 (30元更便宜!)
- **Fix**: 看PE/PB不看绝对股价, 看周期PE不看历史PE
- **Real Case**: 云铝30元PE=22.82(低估) vs 怡球3元PE=170.81(高估), 结果买错了

**Trap 2: "Left-Side Order Hanging" (左侧挂单陷阱)**
- **Symptom**: "等回调10-15%再买" → 龙头不深调 → 永远等不到
- **Reality**: 高景气龙头"以横代跌", 不会给深度回调机会
- **Fix**: 3-3-4法则, 30%先上车, 不要100%等完美买点
- **Real Case**: 云铝等-12%永远没来, 神火等-7%永远没来 → 核心仓位0%

**Trap 3: "Static Anchoring" (静态锚定陷阱)**
- **Symptom**: "白银52-55是支撑" → 价格涨到60还在等52 → 完全踏空
- **Reality**: 支撑位是动态的,会随价格上移
- **Fix**: 移动止损法, 20日均线跟踪, 不是固定价格
- **Real Case**: 白银56时等52-55回调 → 价格60+ → 支撑已上移到57-58

**Trap 4: "Allocation Execution Failure" (配置执行失败)**
- **Symptom**: 选对股票(云铝/神火龙头)但仓位0% → 判断再对也白搭
- **Reality**: 配置执行 > 标的选择
- **Fix**: 使用执行checklist, 不能只有"计划"没有"行动"
- **Real Case**: 原定云铝40%+神火20% → 实际0%+0% → 错过主升浪

**Execution Checklist (执行清单 - 强制检查)** ✅:
```
建仓前必查:
□ 第一批30%订单是否已下单? (不能只是"计划")
□ 第二批30%挂单价格是否合理? (5-8%回调,不是15%+)
□ 第二批挂单是否设定期限? (3-5天未成交则取消)
□ 移动止损线是否设定? (20日均线 or ATR 2x)
□ 是否克服"恐高"心理? (看PE不看股价)
□ 是否避免"左侧挂单"陷阱? (不等深度回调)
□ 总仓位是否符合conviction? (高/中/低对应100%/40%/10%)
```

5. **Final Recommendation**:
   - Clear recommendation: Buy (3-3-4 method) / Hold / Avoid
   - Reasoning: 2-3 key reasons from all analysis layers
   - Timeline: When to enter (30% now, 30% within 3-5 days, 40% on breakout)
   - Risk triggers: What would invalidate the thesis?
   - **Execution Plan**: Specific prices for each 3-3-4 batch

**Output**:
- Final strategy table: `step5/report/05_汇总_介入策略表.md`
- Fields: Stock, Business Score, Catalyst, Technical Signal, Supply Chain Conf, Recommendation, Entry Range, Support, Target1/2/3, Risk Triggers, Timeline
- Executive summary: `step5/report/05_汇总_最终决策摘要.md`
- Directory: `step5/`

**Checklist Before Decision** ⭐:
- ✅ Have you personally reviewed all analysis? (Don't just rely on AI synthesis)
- ✅ Is the recommendation clear and backed by 2-3 key reasons?
- ✅ Are risk triggers defined (what would change your mind)?
- ✅ Are timeline expectations clear (when to buy, when to sell)?
- ✅ Does entry price make sense given current technical setup?
- ✅ Can you explain your thesis to someone else clearly?

**Implementation Notes**:
- 🎯 **High Conviction**: Business + Catalyst + Technical all aligned → **3-3-4 full position (100%)**
  - 30% immediate, 30% pullback order (3-5 day limit), 40% breakout追加
- 🟡 **Medium Conviction**: 2 of 3 factors aligned → **Partial 3-3-4 (40% max)**
  - 20% immediate, 20% pullback order, skip breakout追加
- 🔴 **Low Conviction**: Only 1 factor favorable → **Starter only (10%)**
  - 10% immediate for monitoring, no追加
- ⛔ **No Setup**: Thesis broken or factors misaligned → **Avoid or close position**

**心理陷阱最后检查** (Before executing):
- ❌ Am I waiting for "perfect pullback" and risking踏空? → Use 3-3-4 instead
- ❌ Am I anchored to absolute stock price instead of PE? → Check周期PE
- ❌ Do I have execution plan or just "配置方案"? → Use execution checklist
- ❌ Is my stop-loss fixed or dynamic? → Must use moving stop-loss

**📋 Checklist Update**: After completing Step5c, update `checklist.md`:
- ✅ Mark all Step5 files as complete
- Fill in "最终推荐" (BUY/HOLD/AVOID stocks)
- Fill in "3-3-4建仓计划" (verify all 4 items checked)
- Mark "Step5c完成" and perform quality check

**🎯 Phase 4 Milestone Check**: Before proceeding to Step6, review checklist:
- [ ] All stocks have technical analysis completed?
- [ ] BUY/HOLD/AVOID decisions are clear?
- [ ] 3-3-4 position building plan is complete?
- [ ] Risk triggers defined?

### Phase 6: Research Report Cross-Validation (Step6 - 研报交叉验证 - BUY推荐股必做)

**Objective**: For stocks with "BUY" recommendation from Step5c, retrieve and analyze recent broker research reports to cross-validate investment thesis and identify blind spots.

**⚠️ Critical Purpose - Avoid Confirmation Bias**:
```
问题: 前5步都是我们自己的分析 → 可能存在盲点、偏见、信息缺失
解决: 专业机构研报 → 不同视角、独立调研、行业深度

价值:
1. 发现我们遗漏的风险点
2. 验证我们的核心假设
3. 获取一手调研数据(产能/订单/价格)
4. 了解机构共识(一致预期 vs 分歧点)
```

#### Step6a: Research Report Search & Download (研报检索与下载 - 半自动)

**Objective**: Search and download recent research reports from major brokers for BUY-recommended stocks.

**Process**:
1. **Filter Target Stocks**:
   - Read Step5c output: `step5/report/05_汇总_介入策略表.md`
   - Select stocks with "BUY" recommendation
   - Priority: High conviction stocks first

2. **Research Report Search**:
   - **Time window**: Recent 3-6 months (注意时效性!)
   - **Sources**: Major brokers (中信证券、国泰君安、华泰证券、中金公司、招商证券)
   - **Platforms**: 
     - 东方财富研报中心 (http://data.eastmoney.com/report/)
     - 同花顺研报 (http://stockpage.10jqka.com.cn/)
     - 巨潮资讯研报 (http://www.cninfo.com.cn/)
     - Wind/Choice (if available)
   - **Keywords**: Stock code + stock name

3. **Report Filtering Criteria**:
   - ✅ **Must-have**: Published within 3-6 months
   - ✅ **Prefer**: Top-tier brokers (中信/中金/华泰/国泰君安)
   - ✅ **Prefer**: Industry in-depth reports (行业深度) or company research (公司研究)
   - ❌ **Avoid**: Morning briefings (晨会速递), event comments without new info
   - ❌ **Avoid**: Reports older than 6 months (outdated)

4. **Download & Organization**:
   - Download 2-3 most recent reports per stock
   - Save as PDF: `step6/reports/{代码_名称}/{YYYYMMDD}_{券商}_{报告标题}.pdf`
   - Create index: `step6/reports/research_report_index.yaml`

**Output**:
- Research reports: `step6/reports/{代码_名称}/`
- Report index: `step6/reports/research_report_index.yaml`
  - Fields: stock_code, stock_name, report_date, broker, title, rating, target_price, file_path
- Directory: `step6/reports/`

**Tools** (semi-automated):
- Manual search on platforms (most reliable)
- Optional helper script: `step6/tools/step6a_search_reports.py` (web scraping)

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Are all BUY-recommended stocks covered?
- ✅ Are reports recent (within 3-6 months)?
- ✅ Are top-tier brokers represented?
- ✅ Is the report index complete with metadata?

#### Step6b: Research Report Analysis & Comparison (研报分析与对比 - AI + 人工)

**Objective**: Extract key insights from research reports and compare with our own analysis to identify alignment and conflicts.

**Process**:
1. **AI-Assisted Content Extraction** (for each report):
   - **Investment Rating**: 买入/增持/中性 (Buy/Overweight/Neutral)
   - **Target Price**: Price target and upside potential
   - **Core Thesis**: Why bullish/bearish? (2-3 key reasons)
   - **Financial Forecasts**: Revenue/EPS projections for 2026-2027
   - **Key Risks**: What risks did broker identify?
   - **Valuation Method**: DCF/PE/PB/EV/EBITDA?
   - **Unique Insights**: Any proprietary research/channel checks/management interviews?

2. **Cross-Validation Matrix** (Our Analysis vs Broker Reports):

   | Dimension | Our View (Step1-5) | Broker Consensus | Alignment? | Action |
   |-----------|-------------------|------------------|------------|--------|
   | **Core Catalyst** | [Our catalyst] | [Broker catalyst] | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Validate/Investigate/Challenge |
   | **Business Quality** | [Score 1-10] | [Rating] | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Validate/Investigate/Challenge |
   | **Valuation** | [Our PE/PB] | [Broker PE/PB] | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Validate/Investigate/Challenge |
   | **Target Price** | [Our target] | [Broker target] | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Validate/Investigate/Challenge |
   | **Key Risks** | [Our risks] | [Broker risks] | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Validate/Investigate/Challenge |

3. **Conflict Analysis** (重点关注分歧点):
   - **Type 1 - We Bullish, Brokers Bearish**: 🚨 RED FLAG
     - Action: Re-examine our thesis, identify what we missed
     - Question: Do brokers have information we don't have?
   - **Type 2 - We Bearish, Brokers Bullish**: ⚠️ OPPORTUNITY or TRAP?
     - Action: Check if brokers are outdated or have newer catalysts
     - Question: Are we too conservative?
   - **Type 3 - Same Direction, Different Magnitude**: 🟡 CALIBRATION
     - Action: Adjust position sizing or target price
     - Question: Are we too aggressive/conservative on upside?
   - **Type 4 - Different Risk Assessment**: ⚠️ BLIND SPOT
     - Action: Incorporate missed risks into Step5 risk management
     - Question: What risk factors did we overlook?

4. **Broker Coverage Consensus**:
   - **High Coverage (5+ reports)**: Crowded trade, may be priced in
   - **Medium Coverage (2-4 reports)**: Normal attention
   - **Low Coverage (0-1 reports)**: Under-the-radar opportunity OR red flag

5. **Update Our Thesis**:
   - Incorporate valid broker insights
   - Adjust conviction level if major conflicts found
   - Update risk assessment with newly identified risks
   - Revise target price if broker valuations more rigorous

**Output**:
- Cross-validation analysis: `step6/analysis/06_{代码}_{名称}_研报交叉验证.md`
- Summary table: `step6/report/06_汇总_研报对比表.md`
  - Fields: Stock, Our Rating, Broker Consensus, Alignment Level, Key Conflicts, Action
- Updated recommendation: `step6/report/06_更新后推荐.md` (revised from Step5)
- Directory: `step6/`

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Have you identified major conflicts between our view and brokers?
- ✅ Have you investigated reasons for conflicts (not just ignored them)?
- ✅ Have you updated risk assessment with broker-identified risks?
- ✅ Is the conviction level adjusted based on cross-validation?

**Decision Framework After Cross-Validation**:

```
情况1: 高度一致 (Alignment >80%)
我们: 买入 | 券商: 买入/增持 | 核心逻辑一致
→ 行动: 维持BUY推荐，按原3-3-4计划执行
→ 风险: 可能是拥挤交易，已被市场price-in

情况2: 部分一致 (Alignment 50-80%)
我们: 买入 | 券商: 买入 | 但目标价/风险评估不同
→ 行动: 调整目标价或仓位，整合双方风险点
→ 风险: 需要clarify分歧来源

情况3: 方向一致但时间差 (Time Lag)
我们: 买入(基于最新催化) | 券商: 增持(报告2-3个月前)
→ 行动: 验证催化剂是否仍有效，券商可能未更新
→ 风险: 我们的催化可能已失效

情况4: 重大分歧 (Alignment <50%)
我们: 买入 | 券商: 中性/减持 OR 我们关注的风险券商未提及
→ 行动: 🚨 STOP! 深入调研分歧原因
→ 风险: 可能存在重大盲点，暂缓建仓

情况5: 无研报覆盖 (No Coverage)
我们: 买入 | 券商: 无人关注
→ 行动: 两种可能 - Under-the-radar gem OR 有问题股票
→ 风险: 需extra验证，小仓位试探
```

#### Step6c: Final Recommendation Update (最终推荐更新)

**Objective**: Integrate research report insights and issue updated final recommendation.

**Process**:
1. **Conviction Level Adjustment**:
   - **Upgrade** (Medium → High): Broker reports strongly support our thesis + add new bullish points
   - **Maintain**: Broker reports align with our view, no major new info
   - **Downgrade** (High → Medium): Broker reports identify risks we missed
   - **Downgrade to HOLD/AVOID**: Major conflicts, broker consensus bearish

2. **Position Sizing Adjustment**:
   - If broker consensus bullish + our thesis confirmed → Full 3-3-4 (100%)
   - If minor conflicts → Reduce to 2-2-2 (60%)
   - If major conflicts → Starter position only (10-20%) pending clarification

3. **Risk Management Update**:
   - Add broker-identified risks to risk trigger list
   - Set stricter stop-loss if new risks discovered
   - Monitor broker rating changes (downgrade = exit signal)

4. **Generate Updated Report**:
   - Combine Step5 + Step6 insights
   - Clear statement: What changed after reading research reports?
   - Updated 3-3-4 execution plan with revised conviction

**Output**:
- Updated strategy: `step6/report/06_最终推荐(研报验证后).md`
- Changes summary: `step6/report/06_相比Step5的调整说明.md`
- Fields: Stock, Original Rating (Step5), Updated Rating (Step6), Key Changes, Broker Insights Incorporated

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Have you read at least 2-3 recent research reports per BUY stock?
- ✅ Have you investigated major conflicts (not ignored them)?
- ✅ Have you updated risk triggers based on broker insights?
- ✅ Is the updated conviction level justified?
- ✅ Are position sizes adjusted appropriately?
- ✅ Can you explain what changed and why?

**📋 Checklist Update**: After completing Step6c, update `checklist.md`:
- ✅ Mark all Step6 files as complete
- Fill in "Conviction调整" (升级, 降级, 放弃 and reasons)
- Mark "Step6c完成" and perform quality check

**🎯 Phase 5 Milestone Check**: Before proceeding to Step7, review checklist:
- [ ] All BUY stocks have research report validation?
- [ ] Major divergences investigated?
- [ ] Conviction levels adjusted?

**⚠️ Critical Reminder**:
```
研报不是gospel (福音书)，也可能错:
1. 券商可能滞后(2-3个月前的判断)
2. 券商可能有利益冲突(投行部门关系)
3. 券商可能跟风(从众心理)

但研报提供valuable second opinion:
1. 专业团队调研数据
2. 不同视角看问题
3. 帮助发现盲点

最终决策: 独立思考 > 盲从研报
```

### Phase 7: Multi-Perspective Reflection (Step7 - 多视角反思与"斗蛊" - 最终决策前必做)

**Objective**: Before final investment decision, use multiple AI models to cross-challenge our thesis, identify blind spots, and force adversarial thinking.

**⚠️ Critical Purpose - Avoid Groupthink and Single-Model Bias**:
```
问题: 前6步可能都用同一个AI模型 → 模型偏见、幻觉、知识盲区
解决: 跨模型"斗蛊" → 利用不同模型的盲区互相纠错

核心思想:
1. DeepSeek: A/H股数据库强、本土化好
2. ChatGPT: 逻辑推理强、全球视野
3. Gemini: 搜索能力强、实时信息

最大价值: 让AI互相攻击我们的论证 → 暴露最弱环节
```

#### Step7a: Cross-Model Challenge (跨模型质疑 - AI+人工)

**Objective**: Use different AI models to challenge our stock selection and core thesis.

**Process**:
1. **Model 1 (e.g., DeepSeek) - Initial Analysis**:
   - Use our Step1-6 conclusion as baseline
   - Ask: "Based on my research, I plan to buy [股票A] and [股票B]. Do you agree?"

2. **Model 2 (e.g., ChatGPT) - Adversarial Challenge**:
   - Present same thesis to different model
   - Ask adversarial questions (use Template 11)

3. **Model 3 (e.g., Gemini Deep Research) - Fresh Perspective**:
   - No prior context, ask for independent analysis
   - Compare: "Gemini thinks [股票C] is better, but I chose [股票A]. Why the difference?"

4. **Conflict Matrix** (关键分歧点对比):

   | Stock | Model 1 (Our Pick) | Model 2 Challenge | Model 3 Independent | Consensus? | Action |
   |-------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|--------|
   | 股票A | BUY (核心30%) | Neutral (风险X) | AVOID (理由Y) | ❌ NO | 重新评估 |
   | 股票B | BUY (核心30%) | BUY (一致) | BUY (一致) | ✅ YES | 维持 |
   | 股票C | NOT SELECTED | Neutral | BUY (强推) | ⚠️ BLIND SPOT | 补充调研 |

5. **Key Divergence Investigation**:
   - For each "NO consensus" stock: Why did models disagree?
   - For each "BLIND SPOT" stock: Should we replace one of our picks?

**Output**:
- Cross-model challenge report: `step7/analysis/07_跨模型质疑对比.md`
- Directory: `step7/`

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Have you used at least 2-3 different AI models?
- ✅ Have you asked adversarial questions (not just confirmation)?
- ✅ Have you investigated reasons for disagreement?

#### Step7b: Adversarial Reflection (对抗性反思 - 人工)

**Objective**: Force ourselves to argue AGAINST our own thesis.

**Process**:
1. **Devil's Advocate Exercise** (魔鬼代言人):
   - For each BUY recommendation, write down:
     - **3 reasons why we SHOULD NOT buy this stock**
     - **What would make this investment fail?**

2. **Kill Criteria** (杀死标准):
   - Define specific triggers that would immediately invalidate our thesis:
     ```
     如果出现以下情况,立即清仓:
     □ [核心客户]取消订单 or 占比从30%降至10%
     □ [核心产品]出现技术替代方案
     □ [核心催化剂]放缓/取消(如政策变化)
     □ 股价跌破[关键支撑位] and 无新催化剂
     □ 券商集体下调评级 to 中性/减持
     ```

**Output**:
- Bear case analysis: `step7/reflection/07_看空理由分析.md`
- Kill criteria: `step7/reflection/07_杀死标准.md`

#### Step7c: Final Conviction Calibration (最终信心校准)

**Objective**: Recalibrate conviction levels and finalize investment decision.

**Process**:
1. **Conviction Scoring Matrix**:

   | Stock | Original | Cross-Model | Bear Case | **Final** | Action |
   |-------|---------|------------|-----------|----------|--------|
   | 股票A | High | 2/3 agree | Weak | **High** | 维持100% |
   | 股票B | High | 1/3 agree | Strong | **Medium** ↓ | 降至60% |

2. **Final Investment Thesis (One-Page Summary)**:
   ```
   [股票名] - [仓位%] - [信心级别]
   
   核心逻辑: [一句话描述]
   支持论据: [Step3/4/6关键发现]
   最大风险: [风险X] → 对冲: [策略Y]
   杀死标准: [具体触发条件]
   
   3-3-4计划:
   - 30% @ [价格1] 立即执行
   - 30% @ [价格2] 挂单(3天期限)
   - 40% @ [价格3] 突破追加
   - 止损: 20日均线
   ```

3. **Final Checklist Before Execution** ⭐⭐⭐:
   ```
   执行前最后检查:
   □ 已经过至少 2-3 个 AI 模型质疑?
   □ 已经写下看空理由并可以反驳?
   □ 已经设定明确的kill criteria?
   □ Expected Value > 15%?
   □ 仓位分配符合conviction级别?
   □ 3-3-4计划已经具体化(不是只有"计划")?
   □ 移动止损已设定(不是固定止损)?
   □ 可以用一句话向朋友解释这个逻辑?
   □ 如果今天不买明天涨停,会后悔吗? (test commitment)
   ```

Step7的目的: 主动找错误,而非证明自己对

如果经过Step7后论证依然站得住 → 信心大增
如果经过Step7后发现重大缺陷 → 感谢在买前发现,避免损失

最糟糕的情况: 跳过Step7,盲目自信 → 市场会教你做人
```

### Bonus: Cross-Model Validation (跨模型验证)

**Objective**: Use different AI models to cross-validate findings and avoid single-model bias.

**Process**:
1. Run same analysis through multiple models (DeepSeek, Gemini, ChatGPT)
2. Compare recommendations and identify discrepancies
3. Challenge assumptions and reasoning
4. Identify potential blind spots
5. Synthesize final conclusion

**Best Practice**: Apply cross-model validation at any step (especially Step1 and Step2) for critical decisions.

**When to Apply Cross-Validation**:
- Step1 sector selection: Different models may identify different macro trends
- Step2 supply chain analysis: Different models may emphasize different segments
- Step3c business verification: Ask different models to challenge your conclusions
- Step5c final decision: Get second opinion on entry strategy before committing capital

### Template 9: 3-3-4 Position Building Execution

```
I want to build position in [STOCK_NAME] using 3-3-4 method. Current price is [PRICE].

**Thesis**: [Business + Catalyst + Technical summary]

**Conviction Level**: High/Medium/Low

Please help me plan:

1) **First 30% (Immediate Entry)**:
   - Entry price: Current market [PRICE]
   - Rationale: Avoid踏空, get observation rights
   - Check: Am I avoiding "waiting for perfect pullback" trap?

2) **Second 30% (Pullback Order)**:
   - Limit order price: [PRICE * 0.92-0.95] (5-8% pullback)
   - Time limit: 3-5 days, cancel if not filled
   - Check: Am I avoiding "left-side hanging" trap (not waiting for 15%+ pullback)?

3) **Third 40% (Breakout Confirmation)**:
   - Trigger: Price breaks [20-day high] on [catalyst news]
   - Check: Am I overcoming "fear of heights" (looking at PE not price)?

4) **Moving Stop-Loss**:
   - Method: 20-day MA or ATR 2x trailing
   - Check: Not using fixed stop-loss?

5) **Psychological Trap Check**:
   - □ Not anchored to absolute stock price?
   - □ Not waiting for deep pullback on strong stocks?
   - □ Have execution plan, not just allocation plan?

我想用3-3-4法建仓[股票名]，当前价格[价格]。

**投资逻辑**: [基本面+催化+技术面摘要]

**Conviction**: 高/中/低

请帮我规划:

1) **第一批30%(立即入场)**:
   - 入场价: 市价[价格]
   - 理由: 避免踏空,获取观察权
   - 检查: 是否避免了"等完美买点"陷阱?

2) **第二批30%(回调挂单)**:
   - 挂单价: [价格*0.92-0.95] (5-8%回调)
   - 期限: 3-5天未成交则取消
   - 检查: 是否避免了"左侧挂单"陷阱(不是等15%+深调)?

3) **第三批40%(突破确认)**:
   - 触发: 突破[20日高点] + [催化消息]
   - 检查: 是否克服了"恐高"心理(看PE不看价格)?

4) **移动止损**:
   - 方法: 20日均线 or ATR 2倍跟踪
   - 检查: 不是固定止损?

5) **心理陷阱检查**:
   - □ 没有锚定绝对股价?
   - □ 没有在强势股上等深度回调?
   - □ 有执行计划不只是配置方案?
```

### Template 10: Research Report Cross-Validation (Step6)

```
I have decided to BUY [STOCK_NAME] based on my Step1-5 analysis. I found [X] recent research reports from brokers. Please help me cross-validate:

**My Thesis**:

Report 2: [券商名] ([日期])
- Rating: [买入/增持/中性]
- Target Price: [PRICE]
- Core Thesis: [SUMMARY]
- Key Risks: [RISKS]

**Cross-Validation Questions**:
1) **Alignment Check**: Where do my thesis and broker reports align? Where do they conflict?
2) **Blind Spot Detection**: Did brokers identify risks I missed? Are these material?
3) **Valuation Gap**: Why is there a difference in target price (if any)? Whose assumptions are more reasonable?
4) **Conviction Adjustment**: Should I upgrade/maintain/downgrade my conviction based on broker insights?
5) **Action Plan**: Should I proceed with full 3-3-4 position, reduce size, or wait for clarification?

我决定买入[股票名]，基于我的Step1-5分析。我找到了[X]份最近的券商研报。请帮我交叉验证:

**我的论证**:
- 核心催化: [催化]
- 业务评分: [X/10]

3) **估值差异**: 目标价为何不同(如果有)?谁的假设更合理?
4) **信心调整**: 基于券商洞察,我应该提升/维持/降低我的conviction吗?
5) **行动计划**: 我应该执行完整3-3-4仓位、减少规模、还是等待澄清?
```

### Template 11: Multi-Perspective Reflection (Step7 - 跨模型斗蛊)

```
**For Cross-Model Challenge (Step7a)**:

有人建议我关注[股票A]和[股票B]作为[板块]的龙头。

1) 你是否认同？如果不认同，请给出理由。
2) 你的推荐列表中为什么没有这两只？
3) 还有没有被它忽略的、但在供应链中不可或缺的公司？

---

**For Adversarial Reflection (Step7b)**:

I have decided to BUY [STOCK_NAME] at [PRICE]. Now I want you to argue AGAINST this decision.

1) **Devil's Advocate**: Give me 3 strong reasons why I SHOULD NOT buy this stock.
2) **Failure Scenario**: What's the most likely scenario where this investment loses 30%+?
3) **Hidden Risk**: What risk am I probably overlooking or underestimating?
4) **Bear Case**: If you were shorting this stock, what would be your thesis?

我决定以[价格]买入[股票名]。现在请你反对这个决定。

1) **魔鬼代言人**: 给我 3 个强有力的理由，说明为什么不应该买这只股票。
2) **失败场景**: 这个投资损夁30%+的最可能场景是什么？
3) **隐藏风险**: 我可能忽略或低估了哪个风险？
4) **看空逻辑**: 如果你要做空这只股票，你的逻辑是什么？

---

**For Final Conviction Calibration (Step7c)**:

After cross-model challenge and adversarial reflection, help me recalibrate:

**Original Thesis**: [SUMMARY from Step1-6]

**Cross-Model Feedback**:
- Model 1: [AGREE/DISAGREE + reasons]
- Model 2: [AGREE/DISAGREE + reasons]
- Model 3: [AGREE/DISAGREE + reasons]

**Bear Case Arguments**: [Top 3 counter-arguments from Step7b]

**Questions**:
1) Given the above feedback, should I upgrade/maintain/downgrade my conviction?
2) Which counter-arguments are most valid? Can I defend against them?
3) Should I adjust position size from [X]% to [Y]%?
4) What's the Expected Value now: Base Case [A]% * 50% + Bull Case [B]% * 25% + Bear Case [-C]% * 25% = ?
5) If Expected Value < 15%, should I abandon this trade?

经过跨模型质疑和对抗性反思后，帮我重新校准：

**原始论证**: [Step1-6摘要]

**跨模型反馈**:
- 模型1: [认同/不认同 + 理由]
- 模型2: [认同/不认同 + 理由]
- 模型3: [认同/不认同 + 理由]

**看空论据**: [Step7b的前3个反驳]

**问题**:
1) 基于以上反馈，我应该提升/维持/降低我的conviction吗？
2) 哪些反驳最有效？我能反驳吗？
3) 我应该调整仓位从[X]%到[Y]%吗？
4) 现在的Expected Value: 基准情况[A]% * 50% + 看多情况[B]% * 25% + 看空情况[-C]% * 25% = ?
5) 如果Expected Value < 15%，我应该放弃这个交易吗？
```

## Best Practices

### Model Selection Strategy
- **Step1 (Sector Selection)**: DeepSeek (best A-share knowledge) → Gemini Deep Research (validation)
- **Step2 (Supply Chain)**: ChatGPT or Gemini (detailed reasoning) → DeepSeek (A-share specifics)
- **Step3c (Financial Analysis)**: DeepSeek (reports/fundamentals) → ChatGPT (second opinion on risks)
- **Step4b (News Classification)**: Gemini Deep Research (web search + classification)
- **Step5c (Final Decision)**: Use Template 7 with multiple models for self-challenge

### Research Workflow Best Practices
1. **Start Broad, Verify Narrow**: Begin with sector (macro) → supply chain (meso) → companies (micro)
2. **Separate Automation from Judgment**: 
   - Automate: Data collection, extraction, initial classification
   - Human review: Financial interpretation, relationship validation, final decision
3. **Document Everything**: Keep notes on what you found, what changed your mind, what surprised you
4. **Cross-Check Systematically**: 
   - Financial reports vs news (Step3c vs Step4b)
   - News timeline vs technical moves (Step4c)
   - Fundamentals vs technical setup (Step5b vs Step5c)
5. **Question Your Assumptions**:
   - Use Template 7 before every major decision
   - Ask "What would prove me wrong?"
   - Build in a 20% margin of safety

### Risk Management Rules
- **Position Sizing**: Never risk more than 2% of portfolio on single thesis
- **Stop Loss**: Set before entering, not after losing
- **Catalyst Timing**: Know when catalyst should be realized; if not by then, exit
- **Thesis Invalidation**: If any major assumption changes, reconsider position
- **Overheating**: If stock has rallied >30% since your thesis began, reassess entry

### Time Investment Estimates
- **Step1**: 1-2 hours (sector scanning)
- **Step2**: 2-3 hours per sector (supply chain research)
- **Step3a/b**: 30-60 minutes (automatic download & extraction)
- **Step3c**: 3-5 hours per company (manual deep reading)
- **Step3.5**: 1-2 hours per supply chain (validation)
- **Step4a/b**: 1-2 hours per stock (news search & classification)
- **Step4c**: 30 minutes (conflict analysis)
- **Step5a**: 15 minutes (automatic data fetch)
- **Step5b/c**: 1-2 hours (trend analysis + decision)
- **Step6a/b/c**: 2-3 hours per BUY stock (research report search, analysis, cross-validation)
- **Step7a/b/c**: 2-4 hours (cross-model challenge, adversarial reflection, final calibration)
- **Total for 5-10 stocks**: 30-60 hours (realistic for quality research with multi-perspective validation)
- Always verify information with official sources
- Use AI as a research assistant, not a decision maker
- Understand that past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Consider your own risk tolerance and investment horizon
