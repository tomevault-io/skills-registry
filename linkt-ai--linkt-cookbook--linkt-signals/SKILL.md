# Linkt Signals Skill

Display recent business signals with associated company and contact information for sales outreach.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Recent Signals

Use `mcp__linkt__list_signals_v1_signal_get` to fetch signals:
- Default: last 30 days
- Page size: 10-20 signals
- Sort by: `detected_at` descending (most recent first)

If no signals found, inform the user they may need to:
1. Set up signal monitoring first (see `python/03_signals/signals_from_sheet.py`)
2. Wait for the monitoring run to complete
3. Check if the ICP has companies to monitor

### Step 2: Enrich with Entity Data

For each signal, get the associated entity (company) using `mcp__linkt__get_entity_v1_entity` with the signal's `entity_id`.

Key fields to extract from company entity:
- `data.name` - Company name
- `data.website` - Company website
- `data.industry` - Industry
- `data.employee_count` - Company size
- `data.description` - Company description

### Step 3: Get Contacts for Each Company

For companies with interesting signals, fetch associated contacts using `mcp__linkt__list_entities_v1_entity_get`:
- Filter by `entity_type: "person"`
- Filter by `icp_id` from the company's ICP

Key contact fields:
- `data.name` or `data.full_name` - Contact name
- `data.title` or `data.job_title` - Job title
- `data.linkedin_url` or `data.linkedin` - LinkedIn profile URL
- `data.email` - Email address (if available)

### Step 4: Present Results

Format output as follows:

```markdown
## Recent Signals (Last 30 Days)

### 1. [Company Name] - [Signal Type Display Name]
**Signal:** [Summary from signal]
**Strength:** [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | **Score:** [0.85] | **Detected:** [Date]
**Source:** [source_url if available]

**Company:** [Industry] | [Employee Count] employees
[Company description snippet]

**Contacts:**
- [Name] ([Title]) - [LinkedIn](url)
- [Name] ([Title]) - [LinkedIn](url)

---

### 2. [Next Company]...
```

### Step 5: Offer Outreach

After displaying signals, ask the user:

> Would you like to reach out to any of these contacts? Enter a number to select a contact, or type 'skip' to exit.

If user selects a contact, provide context for the `/linkt-outreach` skill:
- Signal summary and type
- Company name and context
- Contact name, title, and LinkedIn URL

## Signal Types

Common signal types to highlight:
- `AI Initiatives` - AI projects, ML implementations
- `AI Thought Leadership` - LinkedIn posts about AI
- `AI Job Postings` - Hiring for AI roles
- `funding` - Funding rounds
- `leadership_change` - New executives
- `hiring_surge` - Rapid hiring
- `product_launch` - New products
- `partnership` - Strategic partnerships
- `expansion` - Geographic or market expansion
- `acquisition` - M&A activity
- `layoff` - Workforce reductions
- `award` - Industry recognition
- `pivot` - Strategic direction change
- `regulatory` - Compliance/regulatory news
- `rfp` - Request for proposals
- `contract_renewal` - Contract renewals
- `infrastructure` - Technology investments
- `compliance` - Compliance updates

## Signal Score

Each signal has a `score` field (0.0-1.0) indicating relevance/priority:
- **0.8-1.0**: High priority signals - strong buying signals
- **0.5-0.79**: Medium priority - worth monitoring
- **0.0-0.49**: Lower priority - informational

Display the score alongside strength for prioritization.

## Error Handling

- If API returns no signals: Suggest setting up monitoring
- If entity fetch fails: Skip that signal, continue with others
- If no contacts found: Note "No contacts enriched yet" for that company
