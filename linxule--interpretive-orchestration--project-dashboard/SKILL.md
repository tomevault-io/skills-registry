# project-dashboard

Progress visualization and status reporting for qualitative research projects. Shows where you are in the sandwich methodology and what comes next.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User asks "where am I?" or "what's my progress?"
- User mentions "status", "dashboard", or "progress"
- User wants to know if they're ready for the next stage
- User needs an overview of their project state

## Capabilities

1. **Progress Visualization** - ASCII and structured progress display
2. **Readiness Checks** - Determine if prerequisites are met
3. **Recommendations** - Suggest next steps based on current state
4. **Statistics** - Show coding counts, quotes, concepts

## Scripts

### calculate-progress.js
Calculate progress percentages for each stage.

```bash
node skills/project-dashboard/scripts/calculate-progress.js \
  --project-path /path/to/project
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "stage1_progress": 85,
  "stage2_progress": 30,
  "stage3_progress": 0,
  "overall_progress": 38
}
```

### generate-dashboard.js
Generate a formatted dashboard view.

```bash
node skills/project-dashboard/scripts/generate-dashboard.js \
  --project-path /path/to/project \
  --format ascii|json|markdown
```

### check-readiness.js
Check readiness for stage transitions.

```bash
node skills/project-dashboard/scripts/check-readiness.js \
  --project-path /path/to/project \
  --target-stage stage2
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "ready": true,
  "requirements_met": ["10+ documents", "memos written"],
  "requirements_missing": [],
  "recommendations": ["Consider more memos for depth"]
}
```

## Dashboard Output

### ASCII Format
```
The Sandwich Methodology
========================

     Stage 1: Human Foundation
     [========= ] 90%
     12 documents coded | 5 memos written
     Status: Ready for Stage 2!

     Stage 2: Human-AI Partnership
     [====      ] 40%
     Phase 1: Complete | Phase 2: In Progress | Phase 3: Not Started
     25 documents processed | 156 quotes extracted

     Stage 3: Human Synthesis
     [LOCKED    ]
     Complete Stage 2 to unlock

Next Steps:
- Continue Phase 2 synthesis work
- Review synthesized patterns before Phase 3
```

### JSON Format
Full structured data for programmatic use.

### Markdown Format
Formatted for documentation or export.

## Progress Calculations

### Stage 1 (0-100%)
- Documents manually coded: 70% weight (target: 10)
- Memos written: 30% weight (target: 3)
- Formula: `(docs/10 * 70) + (min(memos,3)/3 * 30)`

### Stage 2 (0-100%)
- Phase 1 Parallel Streams: 33%
- Phase 2 Synthesis: 33%
- Phase 3 Pattern Characterization: 34%
- Each phase: not_started=0, in_progress=50%, complete=100%

### Stage 3 (0-100%)
- Evidence organized: 33%
- Theory developed: 33%
- Manuscript drafted: 34%

## Visualizations

### Sandwich Progress

```
   🍞 HUMAN BREAD (Stage 1)     [COMPLETE]
      Your foundation is solid!

   🧀 AI FILLING (Stage 2)      [IN PROGRESS]
      │ Phase 1: ✓ Parallel streams
      │ Phase 2: → Synthesis (current)
      │ Phase 3: ○ Pattern characterization

   🍞 HUMAN BREAD (Stage 3)     [LOCKED]
      Awaiting Stage 2 completion
```

### Concept Growth

```
Week 1: ▓▓▓           (15 concepts)
Week 2: ▓▓▓▓▓▓        (28 concepts)
Week 3: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓      (35 concepts)
Week 4: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓       (32 concepts - consolidation)
```

## State Dependencies

This skill reads from:
- `.interpretive-orchestration/config.json`
- `stage1-foundation/` directory contents
- `stage2-collaboration/` directory contents

Use `_shared/scripts/query-status.js` for the underlying data.

## Integration Points

- **_shared scripts** - query-status.js provides core data
- **Commands** - /qual-status triggers this skill
- **Hooks** - Updates after significant actions

## Related

- **Commands:** `/qual-status` is the main trigger
- **Skills:** `_shared/` provides underlying state queries
- **Agents:** None directly
