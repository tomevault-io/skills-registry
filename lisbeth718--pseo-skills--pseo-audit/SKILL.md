description: Audit and assess a codebase for programmatic SEO readiness at 1000+ page scale. Use when starting a pSEO project, evaluating an existing codebase for pSEO gaps, or when the user asks to audit, assess, or review their site for programmatic SEO scalability. Use when this capability is needed.

# pSEO Codebase Audit

Perform a structured audit of the codebase to assess readiness for programmatic SEO at 1000+ page scale. Produce a concrete gap analysis with actionable findings.

If **pseo-discovery** was run first, use its output to focus the audit: check whether the codebase can support the specific page types, data models, and URL structures the discovery proposed. If discovery was not run, audit generically.

## Audit Procedure

### 1. Identify the Framework and Architecture

- Detect the framework (Next.js, Astro, Nuxt, Remix, etc.) from config files
- Identify the rendering strategy: SSG, SSR, ISR, or client-side
- Map the routing structure: file-based, dynamic segments, catch-all routes
- Check for `generateStaticParams`, `getStaticPaths`, or equivalent

### 2. Assess Data Architecture

- Locate data sources: CMS, database, API, local files (JSON, MDX, CSV)
- Check for a centralized data-fetching layer vs. scattered inline fetches
- Evaluate whether data models have the fields needed for SEO (title, description, slug, category, FAQ, etc.)
- Look for a slug/URL generation strategy and whether it enforces uniqueness

### 3. Evaluate Routing and Page Templates

- Count dynamic route segments and template pages
- Check if templates produce unique content per page or rely on the same copy with minor variable swaps
- Look for catch-all routes that may create orphan or thin pages
- Verify 404 handling for invalid slugs

### 4. Review SEO Foundations

- Check for dynamic metadata generation (title, description, canonical)
- Look for Open Graph and Twitter card tags
- Search for JSON-LD structured data or schema markup
- Check for a sitemap generator (static or dynamic)
- Look for robots.txt configuration
- Verify canonical URLs are set and self-referencing by default

### 5. Evaluate Internal Linking

- Look for breadcrumb components
- Search for related-pages or hub-spoke linking patterns
- Check for programmatic cross-linking between pages
- Assess whether link structures create topical clusters

### 6. Assess Performance at Scale

- Check build configuration for page generation limits or timeouts
- Look for image optimization (next/image, sharp, etc.)
- Check for code splitting and lazy loading
- Identify large dependencies that bloat the bundle
- Look for caching headers or ISR/revalidation configuration

### 7. Check Content Quality Safeguards

- Look for content length or quality validation
- Search for duplicate content detection or prevention
- Check if pages have sufficiently differentiated titles and descriptions
- Look for noindex rules on thin or utility pages

## Output Format

Structure the audit report as:

```
## pSEO Audit Report

### Framework & Rendering
- [findings]

### Data Architecture
- [findings]
- Readiness: [Ready | Needs Work | Missing]

### Routing & Templates
- [findings]
- Readiness: [Ready | Needs Work | Missing]

### SEO Foundations
- [findings]
- Readiness: [Ready | Needs Work | Missing]

### Internal Linking
- [findings]
- Readiness: [Ready | Needs Work | Missing]

### Performance at Scale
- [findings]
- Readiness: [Ready | Needs Work | Missing]

### Content Quality Safeguards
- [findings]
- Readiness: [Ready | Needs Work | Missing]

### Priority Actions (ordered)
1. [most critical gap]
2. [next priority]
...

### Recommended Skill Sequence
Based on findings, recommend which pseo-* skills to run and in what order.
If discovery was run, confirm which proposed page types are feasible given codebase state.
```

## Scope Parameter

If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a scope, narrow the audit:
- `full` (default): Run all sections
- `routing`: Sections 1, 3 only
- `data`: Sections 1, 2 only
- `seo`: Sections 4, 5, 7 only
- `performance`: Sections 6 only

## Important Constraints

- Read files and analyze; do NOT modify any code during audit
- Be specific: cite file paths and line numbers for every finding
- Flag risks that would surface only at 1000+ pages (build time, memory, URL collisions)
- Distinguish between "not implemented" and "implemented incorrectly"
