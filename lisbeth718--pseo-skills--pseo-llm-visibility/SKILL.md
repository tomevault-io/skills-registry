# pSEO LLM Visibility

Optimize programmatic pages for citation and visibility in AI-generated answers. This is a distinct layer on top of traditional SEO — different crawlers, different extraction patterns, different signals.

## Why This Matters for pSEO

- AI-driven search traffic is growing rapidly and represents a significant share of organic discovery
- LLMs cite only a handful of domains per response vs. 10 blue links in traditional search
- Traditional SEO rank is a weak predictor of AI citation — many cited pages rank outside the top 20 in Google
- Content freshness, structure, and extractability matter more than backlinks for LLM visibility
- Google AI Overviews appear on a large and growing share of searches, and most AI-assisted searches result in fewer outbound clicks

## Core Principles

1. **Extractable, not just readable**: Content must be structured in self-contained chunks that LLMs can pull verbatim
2. **Answer-first**: Lead with the direct answer, then provide supporting context
3. **Entity-rich**: Reference entities and relationships, not just keywords
4. **Multi-engine**: Optimize for Bing (ChatGPT), Google (AI Overviews), and direct AI crawlers (Perplexity) simultaneously
5. **Machine-readable**: Schema, llms.txt, and clean HTML structure help LLMs understand page semantics

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create llms.txt

Place a Markdown file at the site root (`/llms.txt`) that guides LLMs to the most important content. This is a proposed standard gaining rapid adoption — think of it as a curated sitemap for AI.

```markdown
# [Site Name]

> [One-sentence description of what this site covers]

## Key Pages

- [Category Hub A](/category-a): Description of this category
- [Category Hub B](/category-b): Description of this category

## Content Types

- [Page Type]: [What these pages contain and why they're useful]

## Data Sources

- [Where the data comes from, how often updated]

## Full Content

- [/llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt): Complete content index
```

Also create `/llms-full.txt` — a comprehensive version with more detail that LLMs can fetch when they need deeper context.

For pSEO specifically, the llms.txt should:
- List all category hub pages
- Describe what each page type contains
- Note the data source and update frequency (freshness signal)
- Link to the sitemap for full page discovery

### 2. Configure AI Crawler Access in robots.txt

robots.txt creation is owned by **pseo-linking** (section 8). This skill defines which AI crawler rules to include. AI crawlers serve two purposes: **training** (building the model) and **retrieval** (fetching real-time answers). You typically want to allow retrieval crawlers and may want to block training crawlers.

**AI retrieval crawlers — ALLOW (needed for citation):**
```
User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Allow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Allow: /

User-agent: Applebot-Extended
Allow: /
```

**AI training crawlers — BLOCK if you don't want content used for training:**
```
User-agent: Google-Extended
Disallow: /

User-agent: CCBot
Disallow: /
```

See `references/ai-crawlers.md` for the full list of known AI crawlers and their purposes.

**Critical**: If GPTBot is blocked, your content will NEVER appear in ChatGPT answers. If Bingbot is blocked, you lose ChatGPT citations entirely (ChatGPT uses Bing's index for web search).

### 3. Structure Content for LLM Extraction

LLMs extract content in "chunks" — self-contained text fragments of ~100-300 tokens (75-225 words) that can stand alone as a complete answer. Optimize page structure for this:

**The Answer Capsule Pattern:**
```html
<section>
  <h2>[Question or topic as heading]</h2>
  <!-- Answer capsule: 134-167 words, self-contained, directly answers the heading -->
  <p>[Direct answer in the first 1-2 sentences. Then supporting detail.
     The entire paragraph should make sense if extracted without any
     surrounding context.]</p>
</section>
```

**Rules for LLM-extractable content:**
- Each section under an H2/H3 should be a complete, self-contained answer (134-167 words optimal)
- Lead with the conclusion/answer, then provide reasoning
- Never assume the reader has seen other sections — each chunk must stand alone
- Use clear heading-to-content mapping (the heading is the question, the content is the answer)
- Pages with 120-180 words between headings get 70% more ChatGPT citations

**What NOT to do:**
- Long unstructured paragraphs with no headings
- Content that requires reading previous sections to understand
- Vague headings that don't indicate what the section answers
- Burying the answer after paragraphs of context

### 4. Add Statistics and Original Data

Research from "GEO: Generative Engine Optimization" (Aggarwal et al., 2024, arXiv:2311.09735) shows statistics addition improves LLM visibility by ~41% and quotation addition by ~28%. These figures are from controlled experiments and may vary in practice.

For pSEO pages, this means:
- Surface numeric data from the content model as explicit statistics ("4.8 average rating from 500+ reviews")
- Include specific numbers, percentages, dates, and measurements
- Cite data sources explicitly ("According to [source], ...")
- If the business has proprietary data, surface it — LLMs prefer content with information not found elsewhere
- Add relevant expert quotations or attributions where possible

### 5. Implement Entity-Based Optimization

LLMs understand entities (people, places, organizations, concepts, products) and their relationships. Traditional keyword optimization is less effective for AI citation.

For pSEO pages:
- Reference the primary entity by its full canonical name, not just abbreviations
- Include entity relationships ("made by [company]", "located in [city]", "similar to [related entity]")
- Use schema markup to explicitly define entities (Organization, Product, Place, Person)
- Link to authoritative entity sources (Wikipedia, official sites) to help LLMs disambiguate
- Use consistent entity naming across all pages (don't alternate between "NYC" and "New York City")

### 6. Ensure Multi-Engine Indexation

Different AI platforms source from different indexes:

| AI Platform | Primary Source | Requirement |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| ChatGPT | Bing index | Must be indexed by Bing |
| Google AI Overviews | Google index | Must be indexed by Google |
| Perplexity | Own crawler + Bing | Must allow PerplexityBot |
| Claude | Web search | Must be indexable |

**Action items:**
- Verify Bing indexation via Bing Webmaster Tools (not just Google Search Console)
- Submit sitemap to both Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools
- Verify AI crawlers are not blocked in robots.txt
- Use SSR or SSG — AI crawlers cannot execute JavaScript (client-rendered pages are invisible to them)

### 7. Optimize Content Tone and Format

LLMs preferentially cite content that is:
- **Neutral and factual** — not promotional or salesy
- **Comprehensive but concise** — covers the topic fully without padding
- **Comparative** — comparison/list formats make up ~33% of all AI citations
- **Authoritative** — backed by sources, data, and expertise

For pSEO templates specifically:
- Use neutral, informational tone even on commercial pages
- Include comparison sections where relevant (vs. alternatives, compared to similar options)
- Add "at a glance" summary sections that LLMs can extract as complete answers
- Avoid superlatives without data backing ("best", "top", "#1" without evidence)

### 8. Leverage Freshness Signals

Content updated within 30 days gets significantly more AI citations than stale content.

For pSEO at scale:
- Use ISR with short revalidation intervals to keep pages fresh
- Display a visible "Last updated: [date]" on every page
- Include `dateModified` in schema markup with accurate dates
- If data changes (prices, ratings, availability), reflect changes quickly
- Consider automated data refresh pipelines that trigger page regeneration

## LLM Visibility Checklist

- [ ] `/llms.txt` exists at site root with page type descriptions and category links
- [ ] robots.txt allows GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot, Bingbot
- [ ] Site is indexed by both Google and Bing (verify in both webmaster tools)
- [ ] All pages use SSR or SSG (no client-side-only rendering)
- [ ] Each content section is a self-contained 134-167 word answer capsule
- [ ] Headings clearly indicate what the section answers
- [ ] Statistics and specific numbers are present on every page
- [ ] Entity names are consistent and schema-defined across all pages
- [ ] Content tone is neutral and factual, not promotional
- [ ] Comparison/list sections are included where relevant
- [ ] "Last updated" date is visible on every page and in schema
- [ ] FAQ sections use Q&A format that matches natural language queries

## Relationship to Other Skills

- **Builds on**: pseo-templates (page structure), pseo-schema (JSON-LD), pseo-metadata (crawlability), pseo-linking (robots.txt, sitemap)
- **Extends**: pseo-performance (SSR/SSG requirement, freshness via ISR)
- **Validated by**: pseo-quality-guard (content quality is the foundation — thin pages won't be cited by LLMs either)
