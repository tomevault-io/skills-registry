# pSEO Performance Optimization

Optimize the application for fast builds, excellent Core Web Vitals, and reliable performance at 1000+ page scale.

## Core Principles

1. **Static first**: Pre-render as many pages as possible at build time
2. **Incremental where needed**: Use ISR for pages that change frequently
3. **Minimal JavaScript**: Pages should be functional with minimal client-side JS
4. **Image optimization**: All images processed, sized, and lazy-loaded
5. **Cache aggressively**: Cache data fetches, API calls, and rendered output

## Optimization Areas

### 1. Static Generation Strategy

Choose the right rendering strategy for scale:

| Page Count | Strategy | Implementation |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| < 500 | Full SSG | Generate all pages at build time |
| 500-5000 | SSG + ISR | Generate high-traffic pages at build, ISR for rest |
| 5000+ | ISR + on-demand | Generate on first request, revalidate periodically |

**Next.js App Router:**
```typescript
// Generate most important pages at build time
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const topPages = await getTopPages(500);
  return topPages.map((p) => ({ slug: p.slug }));
}

// ISR for the rest
export const revalidate = 86400; // 24 hours
```

**Fallback handling:**
- Always configure a proper fallback (loading state, not blocking)
- Return `notFound()` for genuinely invalid slugs
- Set `dynamicParams = true` to allow ISR for pages not in `generateStaticParams`

### 2. Build Performance

For builds with many pages:

- **Parallelize data fetching**: Fetch all data once at the start, not per page
- **Memoize data access**: Use `React.cache()` or module-level caching to avoid redundant reads
- **Limit build concurrency**: If the build server has limited memory, configure worker limits
- **Incremental builds**: Use ISR to avoid rebuilding all pages on every deploy
- **Monitor build time**: Track build duration and set alerts for regressions

```typescript
// Memoize INDEX-TIER data at module level (lightweight: slug, title, category)
// NEVER cache full page content this way — see section 7 Memory Management
import { cache } from "react";

export const getAllIndexData = cache(async () => {
  // Returns PageIndex[] (~1KB per page) — safe to hold in memory
  return fetchAllIndexDataFromSource();
});
```

### 3. Core Web Vitals

**Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s:**
- Use `next/image` or equivalent for all images (automatic sizing, WebP, lazy loading)
- Preload the LCP image with `priority` prop or `<link rel="preload">`
- Minimize render-blocking CSS; inline critical CSS
- Serve from a CDN with edge caching

**Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1:**
- Set explicit `width` and `height` on all images and embeds
- Reserve space for dynamic content with CSS (min-height, aspect-ratio)
- Never inject content above the fold after initial render
- Use `font-display: swap` with size-adjusted fallback fonts

**Interaction to Next Paint (INP) < 200ms:**
- Minimize client-side JavaScript
- Defer non-critical scripts
- Avoid long tasks in event handlers
- Use `React.lazy()` for below-fold interactive components

### 4. Bundle Optimization

- **Analyze the bundle**: Run the framework's bundle analyzer
- **Tree-shake unused code**: Ensure imports are specific, not barrel imports
- **Code split by route**: Each page route should have its own chunk
- **Externalize large dependencies**: Move heavy libraries to CDN or dynamic imports
- **Remove unused dependencies**: Audit `package.json` for dead dependencies

```bash
# Next.js bundle analysis
ANALYZE=true next build
```

### 5. Caching Strategy

**Build-time caching:**
- Cache data source responses during build
- Use file-system or in-memory caching for computed values
- Cache static assets with immutable headers

**Runtime caching:**
- Set `Cache-Control` headers for static pages (e.g., `s-maxage=86400, stale-while-revalidate`)
- Use ISR revalidation to keep cached pages fresh
- Cache API responses with appropriate TTLs

**CDN caching:**
- Deploy behind a CDN (Vercel, Cloudflare, etc.)
- Configure cache keys to avoid unnecessary invalidation
- Use stale-while-revalidate for non-critical freshness

### 6. Image Optimization

- Use the framework's image component (next/image, etc.)
- Serve images in WebP/AVIF format
- Implement responsive `srcSet` for different viewports
- Lazy load below-fold images
- Set explicit dimensions to prevent layout shift
- Use a CDN image optimizer for dynamic images

### 7. Memory Management at Scale

Node.js default heap is ~1.5GB. At 1000+ pages with rich content, builds will OOM without explicit memory management.

**Increase Node.js heap when needed:**
```bash
# In build script or CI
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" next build
```

**Limit build worker concurrency:**
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    workerThreads: true,
    cpus: 2, // limit parallel workers to reduce total memory
  },
};
```

**Split data loading into light and heavy tiers:**
- **Index data** (slug, title, category, lastModified) — safe to hold all in memory. ~1KB per page = ~1MB for 1000 pages.
- **Full page data** (body content, FAQs, images) — load per-page, never cache the full set. ~50-500KB per page = 50MB-500MB for 1000 pages. This will OOM at scale if cached.

```typescript
// GOOD: Load full data per page
export async function getPageData(slug: string) {
  return fetchSinglePage(slug); // loads ~100KB, GC'd after render
}

// BAD: Cache all full data in memory
const ALL_DATA = await fetchAllPages(); // 500MB+ in memory for entire build
```

**Image processing concurrency:**
- Process images in batches, not all at once
- Use `sharp`'s built-in concurrency limiter: `sharp.concurrency(1)`
- If using `next/image` with remote images, limit simultaneous optimizations

**ISR cache eviction:**
- Next.js ISR caches rendered pages in memory (or disk). At 10,000+ pages, configure:
  - Disk-based cache (default in recent Next.js versions)
  - Set `isrMemoryCacheSize: 0` to disable in-memory ISR cache entirely if memory-constrained
  ```javascript
  // next.config.js
  module.exports = {
    experimental: {
      isrMemoryCacheSize: 0, // rely on disk cache only
    },
  };
  ```

**Sitemap generation:**
- For 50,000+ URLs, stream the sitemap XML to disk rather than building the full array in memory
- Use sitemap index files to split into chunks of 10,000-50,000 URLs each

**Monitor memory during builds:**
```bash
# Track peak memory usage
/usr/bin/time -v next build  # Linux
/usr/bin/time -l next build  # macOS
```

### 8. Publication Velocity and Rollout Strategy

Google's 2025 spam detection system (SpamBrain) monitors how fast pages are published. Dumping thousands of programmatic pages at once is a signal of scaled content abuse.

**Rollout strategy for new pSEO pages:**

| Page Count | Rollout Strategy |
|-----------|-----------------|
| < 100 | Deploy all at once — low risk |
| 100-500 | Deploy over 1-2 weeks in batches of 50-100 |
| 500-2000 | Deploy over 2-4 weeks, monitor Search Console for issues between batches |
| 2000-10K | Deploy over 4-8 weeks, validate indexing and ranking quality per batch |
| 10K-100K | ISR-only (don't pre-build). Submit sitemap in category waves over 8-16 weeks. Use data sufficiency gating to exclude thin pages. See **pseo-scale** for full strategy. |

**Implementation approaches:**

- **ISR with gradual seeding**: Generate pages on-demand via ISR but submit URLs to Google in batches via sitemap updates
- **Feature flag by category**: Launch one category at a time, monitor impact before launching the next
- **Draft/published status**: Mark pages as draft in the data layer, publish in batches by flipping status

**Monitor between batches:**
- Search Console: indexing status, manual actions, coverage issues
- Organic traffic: are existing pages maintaining rankings?
- Crawl stats: is Googlebot crawling the new pages?
- Core Web Vitals: are new pages performing well?

**Do NOT:**
- Publish 5,000+ pages in a single deploy
- Submit all URLs to Google Search Console at once via URL inspection
- Create all pages and then remove them quickly if they don't rank (signals low-quality churn)

### 9. Font Optimization

- Self-host fonts (or use `next/font`)
- Subset fonts to required character sets
- Use `font-display: swap` or `optional`
- Preload the primary font file

## Relationship to Other Skills

- **Optimizes**: pseo-templates (rendering strategy), pseo-data (fetch performance)
- **Independent of**: pseo-metadata, pseo-schema, pseo-linking (these are typically lightweight)
- **Extended by**: pseo-scale (CDN/edge architecture, build strategy at 100K, cache warm-up, crawl budget)
- **Validated by**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or framework-specific performance tools
