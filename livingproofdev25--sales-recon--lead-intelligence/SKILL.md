# B2B Lead Intelligence Methodology

Comprehensive framework for discovering, enriching, scoring, and prioritizing B2B leads using 8 data sources. All API calls use wrapper scripts in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/`.

## Data Source Hierarchy

Query sources in this order — most reliable and cost-effective first:

1. **Apollo.io** — Company firmographics, contacts with direct phone/email, org charts, revenue, tech stack, funding. Script: `apollo-api.sh`
2. **Hunter.io** — Email discovery with confidence scores, domain search, verification. Script: `hunter-api.sh`
3. **Google Places** — Business verification, address, phone, ratings, reviews. Script: `google-places-api.sh`
4. **SerpAPI** — Web/news/jobs search, LinkedIn profiles, hiring signals. Script: `serp-api.sh`
5. **GitHub** — Tech stack detection, team size, open-source activity. Script: `github-api.sh`
6. **SEC EDGAR** — Public company financials (10-K, 10-Q), revenue, earnings. Script: `sec-edgar-api.sh`

## Enrichment Pipeline

For every B2B lead, run this pipeline:

### 1. Discover
- `apollo-api.sh company-enrich --domain <domain>` → company firmographics
- `google-places-api.sh find "<company name> <city>"` → verify existence, get address/phone
- `hunter-api.sh domain-search <domain> --seniority executive` → executive emails

### 2. Enrich
- `apollo-api.sh org-chart --domain <domain>` → decision makers with titles, emails, phones
- `hunter-api.sh find-email --domain <domain> --first <name> --last <name>` → specific contact emails
- `serp-api.sh news "<company>" --num 10` → recent news and signals
- `serp-api.sh jobs "<company>"` → hiring activity
- `github-api.sh languages <org>` → tech stack
- `sec-edgar-api.sh search "<company>"` → financial data (public companies)

### 3. Score
Apply ICP scoring, intent scoring, and priority ranking. See `references/icp-framework.md` and `references/signal-weights.md`.

### 4. Output
Format results as a structured lead report with all gathered fields, scores, and recommended next actions.

## Decision-Maker Scoring (1-10)

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| C-level title (CEO, CTO, CFO, COO) | +4 |
| VP / SVP title | +3 |
| Director / "Head of" title | +2 |
| Manager title | +1 |
| Budget-related keywords in title (Procurement, Purchasing, Vendor) | +1 |
| 3+ years tenure at company | +1 |
| Department matches your product category | +1 |

## Verification Protocol

Never trust single-source data. Cross-reference:
- **Email confidence**: Hunter.io provides scores (accept >80%, verify 50-80%, reject <50%)
- **Phone verification**: Google Places confirms business phone, Apollo for direct dials
- **Title validation**: LinkedIn + company website + Apollo agreement
- **Recency check**: Prefer data updated within 6 months

## Data Quality Standards

| Data Type | Accept (use directly) | Verify (cross-reference) | Reject (discard) |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Email | >80% confidence | 50-80% confidence | <50% confidence |
| Phone | Apollo direct dial | Google Places business | Unverified |
| Title | Multi-source match | Single source | >12 months old |
| Revenue | SEC filing | Apollo estimate | Unverified guess |

## API Rate Limits

| API | Monthly Limit | Per-Request Cost | Strategy |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Hunter.io | 25 (free tier) | 1 request | Verify top leads only, cache results |
| Apollo.io | 900 credits | 1 credit per person/company | Batch wisely, org-chart for bulk |
| SerpAPI | 5000 searches | 1 search | 1 per query type, cache results |
| Google Places | ~11K (free $200 credit) | $0.017 | Use for verification only |
| GitHub | 5000/hour | Free | Use freely |
| SEC EDGAR | Unlimited | Free | Rate limit to 10 req/sec |

Always prioritize free sources first. Use paid APIs (Hunter, Apollo, SerpAPI) only when free sources don't have the data.

## Output Templates

- `/prospect` — Ranked lead list with top fields
- `/deep-research` — Full company profile with all 50+ fields
