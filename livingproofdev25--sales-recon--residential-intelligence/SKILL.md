# Residential Lead Intelligence Methodology

Framework for finding homeowner leads through building permits and enriching with property/owner data. Uses free city open data portals (Socrata) and RentCast for property enrichment.

## Data Sources

1. **Socrata Open Data** (FREE) — Building permits from 6 city portals. Script: `socrata-permits-api.sh`
2. **RentCast** (free tier) — Property details, owner names, tax assessments, sale history. Script: `rentcast-api.sh`

## Pipeline

### 1. Pull Permits
- `socrata-permits-api.sh search <city> --type <project> --days <N> --limit <N>`
- Filter by: city, project type (roofing, hvac, plumbing, etc.), date range, minimum value
- Returns: addresses, work descriptions, permit values, dates

### 2. Enrich Property
For each permit address:
- `rentcast-api.sh property "<address>"` → owner name, property type, beds/baths, sqft, year built
- `rentcast-api.sh value "<address>"` → estimated value, price range
- `rentcast-api.sh sale-history "<address>"` → last sale date/price

### 3. Score
- **Property value tier**: Higher value = higher revenue potential
- **Permit recency**: Recent permits = active project = immediate need
- **Project value**: Higher permit value = bigger project
- **Owner-occupied vs investor**: Owner-occupied = decision maker on site

### 4. Output
Ranked homeowner lead list with owner contact info, property details, permit info, and opportunity score.
