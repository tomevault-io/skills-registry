# Code Exemplars Blueprint Generator

## Configuration Variables
${PROJECT_TYPE="Auto-detect|.NET|Java|JavaScript|TypeScript|React|Angular|Python|Other"}
${SCAN_DEPTH="Basic|Standard|Comprehensive"}
${INCLUDE_CODE_SNIPPETS=true|false}
${CATEGORIZATION="Pattern Type|Architecture Layer|File Type"}
${MAX_EXAMPLES_PER_CATEGORY=3}
${INCLUDE_COMMENTS=true|false}

## Generated Prompt

"Scan this codebase and generate an exemplars.md file that identifies high-quality, representative code examples. The exemplars should demonstrate our coding standards and patterns to help maintain consistency. Use the following approach:

### 1. Codebase Analysis Phase
- Automatically detect primary programming languages and frameworks by scanning file extensions and configuration files
- Identify files with high-quality implementation, good documentation, and clear structure
- Look for commonly used patterns, architecture components, and well-structured implementations
- Prioritize files that demonstrate best practices for our technology stack
- Only reference actual files that exist in the codebase - no hypothetical examples

### 2. Exemplar Identification Criteria
- Well-structured, readable code with clear naming conventions
- Comprehensive comments and documentation
- Proper error handling and validation
- Adherence to design patterns and architectural principles
- Separation of concerns and single responsibility principle
- Efficient implementation without code smells
- Representative of our standard approaches

### 3. Core Pattern Categories

#### Java Exemplars (if detected)
- **Entity Classes**: Well-designed JPA entities or domain models
- **Service Implementations**: Clean service layer components
- **Repository Patterns**: Data access implementations
- **Controller/Resource Classes**: API endpoint implementations
- **Configuration Classes**: Application configuration
- **Unit Tests**: Well-structured JUnit tests

#### Frontend Exemplars (if detected)
- **Component Structure**: Clean, well-structured components
- **State Management**: Good examples of state handling
- **API Integration**: Well-implemented service calls and data handling
- **Form Handling**: Validation and submission patterns

### 4. Architecture Layer Exemplars

- **Presentation Layer**: Controllers/API endpoints, View models/DTOs
- **Business Logic Layer**: Service implementations, Workflow orchestration
- **Data Access Layer**: Repository implementations, Data models, Query patterns
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Logging, Error handling, Auth, Validation

### 5. Exemplar Documentation Format

For each identified exemplar, document:
- File path (relative to repository root)
- Brief description of what makes it exemplary
- Pattern or component type it represents
- Key implementation details and coding principles demonstrated
- Small, representative code snippet (if applicable)

### 6. Output Format

Create exemplars.md with:
1. Introduction explaining the purpose of the document
2. Table of contents with links to categories
3. Organized sections based on selected categorization
4. Up to 3 exemplars per category
5. Conclusion with recommendations for maintaining code quality

The document should be actionable for developers needing guidance on implementing new features consistent with existing patterns.

Important: Only include actual files from the codebase. Verify all file paths exist. Do not include placeholder or hypothetical examples.
"

## Expected Output
Upon running this prompt, GitHub Copilot will scan your codebase and generate an exemplars.md file containing real references to high-quality code examples in your repository, organized according to your selected parameters.
