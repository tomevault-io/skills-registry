# blog-create

harvest blog articles from individual author websites and convert to epub for reading on e-ink devices.

**Purpose**: This skill adds blog *articles* (individual posts from personal blogs) to the epub library, NOT topical feeds or actual books. The resulting epubs are organized in the `/blogs/` folder on the X4 device, grouped by author.

**Scope**: Individual author blogs (Simon Willison, Armin Ronacher, etc.), not curated topical feeds (use feed-create for r/soccer, AI digests, etc.).

## when to use

| use | skip |
|-----|------|
| adding all articles from an author's blog | single post conversion (use `reader url`) |
| discovering new individual author blogs | topical feeds like r/soccer (use feed-create) |
| batch harvesting blog archives | actual books (use `reader search`) |
| suggesting similar blogs based on library | agent documentation (use agents-digest) |

## decision tree: mode selection

```
What do you want to do?
├── add all posts from URL → harvest mode
├── add posts from author name → author mode (lookup URL first)
├── discover similar blogs → suggest mode (analyze library)
├── check what we have → inventory mode
└── unclear → ask which blog URL
```

## harvest mode

extract all post URLs from a blog and convert to epub.

### supported platforms

| platform | detection | extraction method |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| custom blogs | any HTML | agent-browser snapshot + link extraction |
| substack | `/archive` path | agent-browser + pagination |
| medium | `/@username` | agent-browser + infinite scroll |
| ghost | `/ghost/` in HTML | agent-browser + RSS fallback |
| wordpress | `/wp-content/` | agent-browser + sitemap |

### workflow

1. **discover**: use agent-browser to load blog and extract all post URLs
2. **dedupe**: check sqlite to skip existing posts
3. **convert**: batch process with reader CLI
4. **verify**: confirm count matches expected

### tool integration

```bash
# discover posts using agent-browser
agent-browser open https://example.com/blog
agent-browser snapshot -i -c
agent-browser get text "a[href*='/posts/']"  # extract post links

# check existing articles
sqlite3 ~/.epub/library.db "SELECT title FROM library_items WHERE author = 'Author Name'"

# batch convert
for url in $(cat ~/.abbie/feeds/harvested/urls.txt); do
  reader url "$url" --author "Author Name"
done

# Or use the built-in batch command
reader blog harvest --file ~/.abbie/feeds/harvested/urls.txt --author "Author Name"

# verify
sqlite3 ~/.epub/library.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM library_items WHERE author = 'Author Name'"
```

## author mode

look up author's blog URL then harvest.

### sources

| source | command | notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| library | `sqlite3 ~/.epub/library.db "SELECT DISTINCT author FROM library_items"` | existing authors |
| assets | `cat ~/.claude/skills/blog-add/assets/supported-blogs.json` | curated list |
| search | agent-browser search `"[author] blog"` | fallback |

### workflow

1. **lookup**: find blog URL from author name
2. **confirm**: verify URL loads and matches author
3. **harvest**: run harvest mode with URL

## suggest mode

discover new blogs based on library patterns.

### discovery methods

| method | description | tool |
|--------|-------------|------|
| author mentions | blogs mentioned in existing posts | grep epub content |
| similar domains | same hosting/platform | domain analysis |
| blogroll links | "blogroll" sections in existing blogs | agent-browser extraction |
| related topics | tags/categories overlap | sqlite tag query |

### workflow

1. **analyze**: query library for patterns
2. **extract**: find candidate URLs
3. **rank**: score by relevance
4. **present**: show top 10 with stats

### tool integration

```bash
# get existing authors
sqlite3 ~/.epub/library.db "SELECT DISTINCT author FROM library_items ORDER BY author"

# analyze for mentions
for epub in ~/.epub/library/*.epub; do
  unzip -p "$epub" | grep -o 'https://[^"]*' | grep blog
done | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

## inventory mode

check what's in the library and suggest additions.

### queries

```bash
# authors with < 10 posts (incomplete archives)
sqlite3 ~/.epub/library.db "
  SELECT author, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM library_items
  WHERE source IN ('feed', 'backfill', 'url')
  GROUP BY author
  HAVING count < 10
  ORDER BY count DESC
"

# authors missing from known blogs
comm -13 \
  <(sqlite3 ~/.epub/library.db "SELECT DISTINCT author FROM library_items WHERE source IN ('feed', 'backfill')" | sort) \
  <(jq -r '.[].author' ~/.claude/skills/blog-add/assets/supported-blogs.json | sort)

# oldest post dates (check for updates)
sqlite3 ~/.epub/library.db "
  SELECT author, MAX(created_at) as latest
  FROM library_items
  WHERE source IN ('feed', 'backfill')
  GROUP BY author
  ORDER BY latest ASC
  LIMIT 20
"
```

## batch conversion

convert multiple URLs efficiently.

### parallel processing

```bash
# sequential (safe)
cat urls.txt | while read url; do
  node ~/.epub/bin/run.js url "$url" --author "Author"
done

# parallel (faster, 4 workers)
cat urls.txt | xargs -P 4 -I {} node ~/.epub/bin/run.js url "{}" --author "Author"
```

### error handling

```bash
# with retry and logging
mkdir -p ~/.abbie/feeds/harvested
cat urls.txt | while read url; do
  if ! node ~/.epub/bin/run.js url "$url" --author "Author" 2>&1 | tee -a ~/.abbie/feeds/harvested/conversion.log; then
    echo "$url" >> ~/.abbie/feeds/harvested/failed.txt
  fi
  sleep 1  # rate limiting
done
```

## agent-browser patterns

### extract post list

```bash
# open blog archive
agent-browser open https://blog.example.com/archive

# wait for load
agent-browser wait --load networkidle

# get snapshot
agent-browser snapshot -i -c

# extract links
mkdir -p ~/.abbie/feeds/harvested
agent-browser eval "
  Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('a[href*=\"/posts/\"]'))
    .map(a => a.href)
    .join('\\n')
" > ~/.abbie/feeds/harvested/urls.txt
```

### handle pagination

```bash
# click "load more" until exhausted
while agent-browser is visible ".load-more"; do
  agent-browser click ".load-more"
  agent-browser wait 2000
done

# extract all loaded links
agent-browser eval "Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('article a')).map(a => a.href).join('\\n')"
```

### infinite scroll

```bash
# scroll to bottom repeatedly
for i in {1..20}; do
  agent-browser scroll down 1000
  agent-browser wait 1000
done

# extract all visible posts
agent-browser snapshot -i -c
```

## validation

### post conversion

```bash
# verify epub created
test -f ~/.epub/library/*.epub && echo "✓ epub exists"

# verify in database
sqlite3 ~/.epub/library.db "SELECT title FROM library_items WHERE id = '$ID'"

# verify author set
sqlite3 ~/.epub/library.db "SELECT author FROM library_items WHERE id = '$ID'" | grep -q "Author Name"
```

### batch completion

```bash
# expected vs actual count
EXPECTED=$(wc -l < urls.txt)
ACTUAL=$(sqlite3 ~/.epub/library.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM library_items WHERE author = 'Author' AND source IN ('url', 'backfill')")
echo "Expected: $EXPECTED, Actual: $ACTUAL"

# check for failures
test -f ~/.abbie/feeds/harvested/failed.txt && echo "⚠ $(wc -l < ~/.abbie/feeds/harvested/failed.txt) failures"
```

## anti-patterns

| pattern | problem | fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **calling these "books"** | misleading - they're blog articles | say "articles" or "posts", not "books" |
| **using blog-add for topical feeds** | blog-add is for individual authors, not r/soccer | use feed-create skill for curated topics |
| **confusing blogs/ and feeds/** | blogs/=authors, feeds/=topics | remember the distinction |
| using WebFetch for extraction | fails on JS-heavy blogs | use agent-browser with snapshot |
| no deduplication | re-converts existing posts | check sqlite before converting |
| sequential conversion only | slow for 100+ posts | use xargs -P for parallelization |
| missing author name | posts go to Unknown/ | always pass --author flag |
| no error logging | can't retry failures | log errors to file, save failed URLs |
| no rate limiting | gets blocked | add sleep between requests |
