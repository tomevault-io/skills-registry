## Quick checklist

1) Ensure Playwright browsers exist
- `npm run playwright:install`

2) Ensure build artifacts are fresh
- Full build + smoke: `npm run smoke`
- Quick smoke (assumes you already built): `npm run test:smoke:quick`

3) Run one smoke test first
- By name:
  - `npm run test:smoke:quick -- -t "<substring>"`
- By file:
  - `npm run test:smoke:quick -- smoke/tests/<suite>.smoke.spec.ts`

## Common failure modes

- “Binary not found”
  - Smoke resolves the binary from `target/release/lotar` by default.
  - Fix: run `npm run build`, or set `LOTAR_BINARY_PATH` (or `LOTAR_BIN`) to a custom path.

- “Port already in use”
  - The harness normally auto-picks a free port; failures may indicate a stuck server.
  - Re-run with a single test in-band (`--runInBand`) so it’s easier to spot lifecycle issues.

- “SSE readiness / flaky waits”
  - Smoke uses `LOTAR_SSE_READY` hooks and server heartbeats; see `docs/help/serve.md` for the testing aids.

## Useful env vars

- `LOTAR_BINARY_PATH` / `LOTAR_BIN`: override the binary used by smoke.
- `LOTAR_TASKS_DIR`, `LOTAR_HOME`: smoke sets these per-test (see `smoke/helpers/workspace.ts`).
- `RUST_LOG=debug` or `LOTAR_DEBUG=1`: can help when diagnosing server/CLI behavior (keep logs free of secrets/PII).

## Debugging approach

- Prefer `npx vitest watch --config smoke/vitest.config.ts --runInBand` for a tight loop.
- If needed, temporarily enable inherited stdio in the smoke helpers while debugging (but keep changes scoped and revert before finalizing).
