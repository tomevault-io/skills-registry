3.  **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand? Are variable names descriptive?
4.  **Style**: Does it follow the project's coding conventions?
5.  **Maintainability**: Is the code modular? Is it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
6.  **Best Practices**: Are language-specific best practices followed?

## 📤 Output Format

Use the standard template: `knowledge/templates/agents/review_report.template.md` (if it exists) or the following format:
