# Movie Maker Skill

This repo is **docs-first**: it ships guidance (rules + schemas), not an executable pipeline.
This is a skill created with LongStories.ai Skill SEO Audit.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when a user wants a 10-60s mini-movie with a script, shotlist, and render-ready manifest.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does not include a runnable pipeline
- Does not store or upload media
- Does not include provider keys or secrets

## What the agent should produce

1) A **numbered script** (lines `L001…`)
2) A **shotlist** divided into scenes (`S01…`), referencing script lines
3) A **manifest JSON** that combines both and is ready to render

## Start here (MUST do intake)

Read and follow: `rules/start/start-here.md`
Full runbook: `rules/start/end-to-end.md`

## Intake (copy/paste)

Ask these in one message (use an "ask the user questions" tool if available):

1) **Length**: 30s / 45s / 60s?
2) **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 or 9:16?
3) **Voice**: narrator-only (default) or dialogue?
4) **Characters**: names + 1-2 sentence vibe each (we will lock a canonical descriptor)
5) **Music**: none (default) or background music?
6) **Style**: pick a preset (cinematic / 3D animated / anime / 2D / photoreal)
7) **Quality mode**: Draft (480p), Standard (720p), HQ (1080p)
8) **Model preset**: Cheap and Fast (Z-Image Turbo + Seedance v1 fast) or High Quality, Expensive (Seedream 4.5 + Seedance 1.5 pro)
9) **Reference images**: any character/style refs? (if yes, ask user to paste/attach and say you will save to `assets/refs/...`)

If the user does not answer, propose defaults and ask:

> "If I don't hear back, I'll do 30s, 16:9, narrator-only, 3D animated style, Draft (480p), High Quality, Expensive preset. Confirm?"

## Core pipeline (voiceover-first)

```text
Script -> Voiceover timing -> Finalize shot durations -> Generate images -> Generate videos -> Render locally -> Share
```

## Model presets (image + video combo)

See: `rules/providers/model-presets.md`

Quick summary:
- **Cheap and Fast**: Z-Image Turbo + Seedance v1 fast
- **High Quality, Expensive**: Seedream 4.5 + Seedance 1.5 pro
