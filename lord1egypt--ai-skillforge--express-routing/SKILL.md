# Express Routing

## Overview
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web applications.

## When to Use This Skill
Use to implement REST API backends, route controllers, or static file servers in JavaScript.

## Quick Start (with runnable code examples)

```python
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Welcome to Express' });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## Advanced Usage
Formulate custom authorization middlewares, configure CORS options, and route handlers using express.Router namespaces.

## Key References
