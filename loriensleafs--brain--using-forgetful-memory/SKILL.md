# Using Brain Memory

Brain is a semantic knowledge graph built from markdown files using Zettelkasten (atomic note) principles. Files are the source of truth. This skill guides effective memory usage.

## Core Principles

- **Local-First**: Plain text markdown files on user's computer
- **Files are Truth**: Database is derived state, files are source of truth
- **Persistent**: Knowledge survives across sessions
- **Semantic**: Observations and relations create a navigable knowledge graph

## When to Query Memory

Query memory proactively when:

- Starting work on a project (check for existing context)
- User references past work, decisions, or discussions
- Encountering a problem that may have been solved before
- Implementing patterns that may already be documented
- Needing context about preferences or approaches

Use `mcp__plugin_brain_brain__search_notes` with:

- `query`: Natural language search terms
- Optional filters: `category`, `tags`, `project`

### Getting Recent Notes

To see what's been recorded recently:

```
mcp__plugin_brain_brain__list_notes({
  "limit": 10,
  "project": "project-name"
})
```

This is useful when:

- Starting a session on a project you haven't worked on recently
- Reviewing what was captured in previous conversations
- Getting a quick overview of project knowledge

## When to Create Notes

Create notes for knowledge worth preserving:

- Important decisions with rationale
- Technical patterns or approaches
- Architectural choices
- Preferences and workflows
- Project milestones
- Solutions to non-trivial problems
- Bug investigations and root causes

Do NOT create notes for:

- Temporary context (current file paths, transient issues)
- Common knowledge available elsewhere
- Trivial or throwaway information
- Content that changes frequently

## Atomic Note Principles

Each note must pass the atomicity test:

1. Can you understand it at first glance?
2. Can you title it in 5-50 words?
3. Does it represent ONE concept/fact/decision?

### Note Structure

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Title | Short, searchable phrase |
| Category | Type: analysis, research, decision, feature, bug, pattern |
| Observations | Atomic facts about the topic |
| Relations | Links to other notes (bidirectional) |
| Tags | For categorization and filtering |
| Context | Additional markdown content |

### Observations

Observations are atomic facts within a note. Each observation should:

- State ONE fact, insight, or finding
- Be self-contained and understandable
- Use clear, specific language

Example observations:

```
- "Uses JWT with httponly cookies for session management"
- "Performance degrades above 1000 concurrent connections"
- "Decided against GraphQL due to caching complexity"
```

### Relations

Relations connect notes semantically:

- `relates_to`: General connection between topics
- `depends_on`: Technical or logical dependency
- `implements`: Implementation of a design/spec
- `supersedes`: Replaces an older note
- `references`: Cites or mentions another note

## Query Before Create

Always check for existing notes before creating:

```
mcp__plugin_brain_brain__search_notes({
  "query": "<topic of potential new note>"
})
```

If similar note exists:

- Use `edit_note` with `append` operation to add new observations
- Or create new note with `supersedes` relation if replacing
- Or add `relates_to` relation for connected topics

## Progressive Knowledge Building

Build knowledge incrementally:

1. **Search** for existing note on topic
2. **Append** new observations to existing note
3. **Create** new note only if topic is truly distinct
4. **Link** related notes via relations

Use `mcp__plugin_brain_brain__edit_note` with operations:

- `append`: Add to end (most common for new observations)
- `prepend`: Add to beginning (for urgent updates)
- `find_replace`: Replace specific text
- `replace_section`: Replace markdown section by heading

## Announcing Memory Operations

When creating a note, announce:

```
Saved to memory: "[title]"
   Category: [category]
   Tags: [tags]
   Relations: [linked note titles]
```

When querying, summarize:

```
Found X notes about [topic]:
- [Note 1]: [brief insight]
- [Note 2]: [brief insight]
```

## Content Organization

Notes are organized by:

- **Category**: analysis, research, decision, feature, bug, pattern, spec, etc.
- **Project**: Optional project scope
- **Tags**: Cross-cutting categorization

Example directory structure:

```
notes/
├── analysis/
│   └── topic-slug/
│       └── overview.md
├── decisions/
│   └── decision-slug.md
├── features/
│   └── feature-slug/
│       └── overview.md
└── patterns/
    └── pattern-name.md
```
