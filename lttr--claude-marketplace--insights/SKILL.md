# Codebase Insights Skill

Generate activity summaries revealing what's happening in a codebase day-to-day and week-to-week.

## Data Sources

| Source           | Tool               | Data                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Azure PRs        | `az repos pr list` | PRs opened, merged, reviewed            |
| Azure Work Items | `az boards query`  | Tickets started, completed, in progress |
| Local Git        | `git log`          | Commits in current repo                 |
| Confluence       | Atlassian MCP      | Recently modified pages                 |

## Workflow

### 1. Collect Data

Run collectors from the current repository directory:

```bash
# Azure PRs (last N days)
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/collectors/azure-prs.js --days 7

# Azure work items (last N days)
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/collectors/azure-workitems.js --days 7

# Local git commits (last N days)
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/collectors/git-commits.js --days 7
```

**Confluence:** Search for recent pages using Atlassian MCP:

```
mcp__atlassian__rovo_search(query: "modified:>YYYY-MM-DD space_key")
```

Extract and save to `.insights/raw/confluence.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "12345",
    "title": "Page Title",
    "space": "SPACE",
    "lastModified": "2025-01-08",
    "lastModifiedBy": "Author Name",
    "url": "https://..."
  }
]
```

Data saved to `.insights/raw/`.

### 2. Filter by Period

```bash
# For daily summary
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/collectors/filter-by-date.js .insights/raw/commits.json --day 2025-01-08

# For weekly summary
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/collectors/filter-by-date.js .insights/raw/commits.json --week 2025-01-08
```

### 3. Generate Summary

Use templates from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/`:

- `daily-summary.md` - Daily activity report
- `weekly-summary.md` - Weekly activity report

### 4. Save Output

Reports saved to `.insights/`:

- Daily: `.insights/YYYY-MM-DD-insights.md`
- Weekly: `.insights/YYYY-WXX-insights.md`

## Commands

| Command                      | Description                             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `/df:insights:daily [date]`  | Generate daily codebase summary         |
| `/df:insights:weekly [date]` | Generate weekly codebase summary        |
| `/df:insights:catchup`       | Download raw data since last collection |

### Monthly Review

For monthly reviews, use the significance-based formatter:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/collectors/format-review.mjs --month YYYY-MM
```

Or follow the `templates/monthly-review.md` template for AI-generated analysis focusing on:

- High-impact initiatives grouped by theme
- Effort estimation (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Status tracking (Shipped/In Progress/Troubled)
- Top contributors by focus area

## Usage Examples

- "What happened in the codebase today?"
- "Summarize this week's activity"
- "Show me PR activity for the last 7 days"
- "What work items were completed this week?"

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Azure DevOps CLI configured
az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORG project=YOUR_PROJECT

# Authenticated
az login
```

## Confluence Integration

Requires Atlassian MCP server configured. During data collection, use `rovo_search` to find recently modified pages.

**Search query format:** `modified:>YYYY-MM-DD [space_key] [keywords]`

Collects metadata only: page title, space, last modified date, author. No full content.

Ensure Atlassian MCP is configured.
