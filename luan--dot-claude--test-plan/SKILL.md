# Test Plan

Analyze changes, classify by risk, produce structured manual test plan. Auto-exits for trivial changes.

## Context

Stat: !`git diff --stat HEAD 2>/dev/null`
Files: !`git diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null`

## Interviewing

See rules/skill-interviewing.md.

## Step 1: Scope

Use injected Stat/Files above for the no-args case. Override with $ARGUMENTS:

| Input        | Diff source                |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| `main..HEAD` | `git diff main..HEAD`      |
| file list    | `git diff HEAD -- <files>` |
| `#123`       | `gh pr diff 123`           |

**Early exit.** ALL files trivial (after excluding never-trivial files) → `## Test Plan: No Manual Testing Required` + stat output.

Trivial: _.md (except SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, _.mdx), \*.txt, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, comment-only, whitespace-only, CI metadata.

SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, and \*.mdx are **never trivial** — executable specs that change agent behavior. Analyze with code rigor: what behavior changed, what could break, what to verify.

## Step 2: Analyze

Read the full diff. Classify each changed file by risk and type. Include a 1-sentence justification per file referencing the specific change characteristic (e.g., "Critical — modifies auth token validation logic").

### Risk Levels

| Level        | Scope                                                                                 | Verification                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Data loss or security breach risk (auth, persistence, payments, security, infra)      | Test first, most thoroughly |
| **High**     | User-visible behavior (UI, API contracts, business logic, error handling, perf paths) | Full verification steps     |
| **Medium**   | Indirect impact (refactors changing control flow, dep updates, logging, build config) | Targeted verification       |
| **Low**      | Unlikely user-facing (style fixes, adding tests, code comments, dev tooling)          | Spot-check only             |

Multiple levels apply → use highest. A refactor touching auth logic is Critical, not Medium.

### Change Types

Tag each file: **new-feature**, **behavior-change**, **refactor**, **bugfix**, **config**, **dependency**.

## Step 3: Generate

Group verification steps by risk (highest first). Every component must reference domain-specific terms from the diff (function names, endpoints, error messages) — no generic language. Each step:

1. **What** — specific behavior to verify
2. **How** — concrete reproducible actions (e.g., "call `paginate(page=1, size=10)`", "POST `/api/auth/login` with expired token"). Spec changes: invoke skill with specific trigger/argument, verify behavioral change.
3. **Expected** — observable correct outcome
4. **Regression** — adjacent functionality to confirm

Output structure:

```
## Test Plan: <scope summary>
Risk: N critical, N high, N medium, N low
Effort: quick (5min — single-file, Low/Medium risk) | moderate (15min — multi-file, High risk) | thorough (30min+ — any Critical risk present)

### Critical Risk
<verification steps>

### High Risk
<verification steps>

### Low Risk (spot-check)
<brief list>

### Regression Checklist
- [ ] <adjacent area>
```

Omit empty risk sections. All Low → spot-check list only.

For **refactors**: focus on behavior preservation — same inputs → same outputs.
For **bugfixes**: include original reproduction steps + edge cases around fix boundary.

## Step 4: Output

Present the plan and stop.
