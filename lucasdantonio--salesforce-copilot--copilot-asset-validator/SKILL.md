# Copilot Asset Validator

Use this skill to run a cheap, repeatable quality pass over reusable Copilot assets before review or publication.

## When to Use This Skill

- Before opening a pull request that adds or updates instructions, skills, agents, docs, or bundled scripts.
- When a contributor asks for a consistency check across Copilot assets in a repository.
- When you want to catch broken relative links and weak discovery metadata early.
- When you want a portability-focused review without adding repo-specific automation.

## Scripts

- [`validate-assets.ps1`](./scripts/validate-assets.ps1) checks asset frontmatter, required sections, relative Markdown links, weak descriptions, portability risks, and PowerShell script help.

## Typical Workflow

1. Run the validator from the repository root.
2. Fix any reported errors first.
3. Review warnings for portability or discovery-quality follow-up.
4. Re-run the validator before opening or updating a pull request.

## Gotchas

- **The validator uses heuristics for quality and portability checks**. Review warnings as prompts for human judgment, not guaranteed defects.
- **Relative-link checks only verify file paths**. They do not validate in-document heading anchors.
- **This skill is self-contained**. It does not require `.github/scripts/salesforce/`.
