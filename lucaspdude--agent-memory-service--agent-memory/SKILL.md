description: Run a local Agent Memory Service for persistent self-improvement. Clone, set up, and manage your own encrypted memory store. Use when an agent wants to remember learnings, user preferences, and progress across sessions, or when setting up local persistent memory. Use when this capability is needed.

# Agent Memory Skill

Run your own local memory service to persist learnings, preferences, and goals across sessions.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Set up local memory service
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start the service
./scripts/start.sh

# Create your agent identity
./scripts/memory_client.py register

# Store a memory snapshot
./scripts/memory_client.py store --file memory_snapshot.json

# Retrieve your memory
./scripts/memory_client.py retrieve
```

## What This Enables

- **Persistent Learning**: Remember what worked/didn't work
- **User Preferences**: Track communication style, technical preferences
- **Goal Progress**: Maintain long-term objectives across restarts
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Know what you need to learn

## Memory Structure

Store structured memories with these components:

```json
{
  "user_preferences": [
    {"category": "communication", "key": "verbosity", "value": "concise", "confidence": 0.95}
  ],
  "learning_history": [
    {"event_type": "success", "lesson_learned": "Use analogies first"}
  ],
  "knowledge_gaps": [
    {"topic": "Rust", "priority": "medium"}
  ],
  "active_goals": [
    {"title": "Master async patterns", "progress": 0.4}
  ]
}
```

## Using in Your Sessions

1. **At startup**: Load your memory to resume context
2. **During session**: Update preferences based on interactions
3. **Before shutdown**: Store accumulated learnings

## Files

- `scripts/setup.sh` - One-time setup
- `scripts/start.sh` - Start the service
- `scripts/memory_client.py` - CLI client
- `assets/service/` - The memory service code

## Security

- All data encrypted with your private key
- Server never sees plaintext
- Recovery phrase for identity backup
- Local-only (no cloud dependency)
