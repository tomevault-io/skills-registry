Investigate issues and report findings. Does NOT create plans or modify code.

## Purpose

- Investigate reported issues (extraction errors, wrong data, missing matches, file sorting)
- Debug deployment or runtime issues using available logs
- Test and compare Gemini prompts when extraction problems are suspected
- Examine processed files and their destinations
- Analyze codebase to understand behavior
- **Report findings only** - user decides next steps

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS should describe what to investigate:
- What happened vs what was expected
- File IDs or names if relevant
- Error messages or unexpected values
- Which environment (if applicable) — if not specified, ask
- Deployment ID if it's a deployment issue
- Any context that helps narrow the scope

## Context Gathering

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT hardcode MCP names or folder paths.** Always read CLAUDE.md to discover:

1. **Available MCP servers** - Look for "MCP SERVERS" section to find:
   - Error tracking MCPs for crash/error investigation (use ToolSearch to load tools before calling them)
   - File/storage MCPs for accessing documents and data (Google Drive)
   - Deployment MCPs for logs and service status (Railway)
   - AI/LLM MCPs for prompt testing (Gemini)

2. **Project structure** - Look for "STRUCTURE" or "FOLDER STRUCTURE" sections to understand:
   - Where source code and documents are stored
   - Naming conventions and organization

3. **Domain concepts** - Look for sections describing:
   - Document types and their processing
   - Data schemas and formats
   - Business rules and validation

4. **Environments** - Look for "ENVIRONMENTS" section to discover:
   - Environment names (production, staging, etc.)
   - Associated branches and URLs
   - Deployment service configurations

5. **Drive Folder Resolution** - When accessing Google Drive, determine the correct root folder:
   - Check `.env` for `DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID_PRODUCTION` and `DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID_STAGING`
   - If **both** are set: ask the user which environment to investigate (production or staging), then use the corresponding folder ID as the root for all Drive MCP queries
   - If **only one** is set: use it without asking
   - If **neither** is set: fall back to `DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID`

## Investigation Workflow

### Step 1: Classify the Investigation Type

Based on $ARGUMENTS, determine what you're investigating:

| Category | Indicators | Primary Tools |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Extraction** | Wrong data extracted, missing fields, null values | Drive MCP, Gemini MCP, Codebase |
| **Deployment** | Service down, build failures, runtime errors | Railway/Deployment MCP |
| **File Sorting** | Files in wrong folder, unexpected destination | Drive MCP, Codebase |
| **Matching** | Wrong matches, missing matches, unexpected links | Drive MCP, Codebase |
| **Prompt** | Consistent extraction errors on specific doc types | Gemini MCP, current prompts |
| **Performance** | Slow processing, timeouts, resource issues | Deployment logs, Codebase |
| **General** | Unknown cause, need exploration | All available tools |

### Step 2: Gather Evidence

**For Codebase Analysis:**
- Use Grep/Glob for specific searches
- Use Task tool with `subagent_type=Explore` for broader exploration
- Read relevant source files, configs, and tests

**For Deployment Issues (if deployment MCPs available):**
1. **Determine target environment** from $ARGUMENTS (consult CLAUDE.md's ENVIRONMENTS section). If unclear, ask user.
2. Check deployment MCP status
3. List services to find affected service
4. List recent deployments with statuses — pass `environment: "<target>"` explicitly if the MCP supports it
5. Get deployment and build logs — pass `environment: "<target>"` explicitly if the MCP supports it
6. Search logs for errors using filters (e.g., `@level:error`) if the MCP supports it

**For Document/File Issues (if file MCPs available):**
- Search for the problematic file
- Read file contents or metadata
- Check related data stores (spreadsheets, databases)
- Trace the file's processing path

**For Prompt/AI Issues (if AI MCPs available):**
1. Get the source document that has issues
2. Read current prompts from the project's prompts file
3. Test the current prompt against the document
4. Try variations to understand why extraction fails
5. Compare outputs between different prompt versions

### Step 3: Form Conclusions

After gathering evidence, determine:

1. **Root Cause Identified** - You found what's causing the issue
2. **Root Cause Suspected** - Strong hypothesis but not 100% certain
3. **Multiple Possibilities** - Several potential causes, need more info
4. **Nothing Wrong Found** - Investigation shows system working correctly
5. **Cannot Determine** - Insufficient information to conclude

## Investigation Report Format

Write findings to the conversation (NOT to a file):

```
## Investigation Report

**Subject:** [What was investigated]
**Environment:** [production | staging | codebase-only]
**Conclusion:** [Root Cause Identified | Suspected | Multiple Possibilities | Nothing Wrong | Cannot Determine]

### Context
- **MCPs used:** [list MCPs accessed]
- **Environment queried:** [production | staging | N/A]
- **Files examined:** [list key files checked]
- **Logs reviewed:** [deployment IDs, time ranges if applicable]

### Evidence
[What you found - be specific with data points, log excerpts, file contents]

### Findings

[Explain what you discovered. If root cause found, explain it clearly.
If nothing wrong, explain what was checked and why it appears correct.
If uncertain, list possibilities ranked by likelihood.]

### Recommendations (Optional)
[Only if you have specific suggestions - do NOT write a fix plan]
```

## Prompt Testing Guidelines

When investigating AI/LLM extraction issues:

1. **Get the problematic input** using file/document MCPs
2. **Read current prompt** from the project's prompts file
3. **Test with AI MCP** if available:
   - Run current prompt against the document
   - Try variations to isolate the issue
   - Compare outputs to understand failure mode
4. **Document findings** - What works, what doesn't, why

Example workflow:
```
1. Current prompt extracts field X as null
2. Examined document - field X exists with value "ABC"
3. Tested prompt variation A: Added explicit instruction
4. Result: Still null - issue is document format, not prompt
5. Finding: Document has unusual layout Gemini misinterprets
```

## Deployment Debugging Guidelines

When investigating deployment issues (if deployment MCPs available):

1. **Identify target environment** - Determine environment name from CLAUDE.md's ENVIRONMENTS section
2. **Check status first** - Verify MCP/CLI access
3. **List recent deployments** - Get deployment IDs and statuses (pass `environment` param if supported)
4. **Get targeted logs** - Search for errors using filters (pass `environment` param if supported)
5. **Look for patterns** - Repeated errors, timing correlations
6. **Check configuration** - Environment variables, settings (pass `environment` param if supported)

## File Tracing Guidelines

When investigating file sorting or processing:

1. **Find the file** using file MCPs
2. **Check current location** - Where is it now?
3. **Trace processing** - Check logs for processing history
4. **Examine classification** - How was the file classified?
5. **Check destination logic** - What determined where it went?

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| $ARGUMENTS is vague | Ask for more specific details |
| CLAUDE.md doesn't exist | Continue with codebase-only investigation |
| MCP not available | Skip that MCP, note in report what couldn't be checked |
| File/resource not found | Document in report (may be relevant) |
| Cannot reproduce issue | Document steps taken, request more context |
| Logs unavailable | Note in report, suggest alternative approaches |

## Rules

- **Report only** - Do NOT modify source code or files
- **No plans** - Do NOT write PLANS.md or fix plans
- **Discover MCPs** - Read CLAUDE.md to find available tools
- **Explicit environment** - ALWAYS pass the `environment` parameter to deployment MCP tools when supported; never rely on CLI defaults
- **Be thorough** - Check multiple sources before concluding
- **Be specific** - Include exact values, line numbers, timestamps
- **Be honest** - If uncertain, say so; if nothing wrong, say so

## What NOT to Do

1. **Don't create PLANS.md** - This skill only reports
2. **Don't modify code** - Investigation is read-only
3. **Don't assume MCPs** - Discover from CLAUDE.md
4. **Don't conclude prematurely** - Gather sufficient evidence first
5. **Don't force findings** - "Nothing wrong" is a valid conclusion

## Termination

When you finish investigating, output the investigation report.

**If bugs or issues were found that need fixing**, end with:

```
---
Investigation complete. Issues found that may need fixing.

Would you like me to create a fix plan? Say 'yes' or run `/plan-fix` with the context above.
(Fix plans will create Linear issues with your project's issue prefix in Todo state)
```

**If nothing wrong was found or no fix needed**, end with:

```
---
Investigation complete.

To take action based on these findings:
- For bug fixes: Use `plan-fix` with this context (creates Linear issues in Todo)
- For feature changes: Use `plan-inline` with specific request (creates Linear issues in Todo)
- For further investigation: Provide more details and run investigate again
```

Do not offer to implement fixes directly. Report findings and offer skill chaining if appropriate.
