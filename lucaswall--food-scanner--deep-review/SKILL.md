name: deep-review
description: Deep, focused analysis of a single screen or feature. Combines code correctness, security, UX, and performance in one unified Opus pass with cross-domain reasoning. Finds bugs that broad audits miss by tracing full data flows and component interactions. Use when user says "deep review", "deeply analyse", "review this screen", "find all bugs in X", or wants thorough analysis of a specific area. Requires a target area argument. Use when this capability is needed.

Deep analysis of a focused area. You are Opus analyzing directly — no delegation, no team. The value is YOUR cross-domain reasoning across all related files in one context.

## Pre-flight

1. **Validate argument** — `$ARGUMENTS` is REQUIRED. If empty, STOP: "Please specify a target area to review. Example: `/deep-review settings page`"
2. **Verify Linear MCP** — Call `mcp__linear__list_teams`. If unavailable, STOP: "Linear MCP is not connected. Run `/mcp` to reconnect, then re-run."
3. **Read CLAUDE.md** — Load project rules, conventions, and accepted patterns. **Discover team name:** Look for LINEAR INTEGRATION section in CLAUDE.md. If not found, use `mcp__linear__list_teams` to discover the team name dynamically.
4. **Query existing Backlog issues** — `mcp__linear__list_issues` with team [discovered team name], state "Backlog". Record titles and file paths to avoid creating duplicates.

## Scope Discovery

Trace the full dependency graph for `$ARGUMENTS`. Find EVERY file that participates in the target feature.

### Step 1: Find entry points

Read CLAUDE.md's STRUCTURE section to discover file patterns. Use Glob to locate primary files matching `$ARGUMENTS` based on the discovered patterns:
- Pages: `src/app/**/page.tsx`, `src/app/**/layout.tsx`
- Components: `src/components/**/*.tsx`
- Hooks: `src/hooks/**/*.ts`
- API routes: `src/app/api/**/*.ts`

If the argument is ambiguous, use Grep to search for the feature name across the codebase.

### Step 2: Trace imports

Read each entry point. For every import:
- `@/components/*` → add the component file
- `@/hooks/*` → add the hook file
- `@/lib/*` → add the lib module
- `@/types/*` → add the type file
- `@/db/*` → flag if imported outside `src/lib/` (CLAUDE.md violation)

Follow imports recursively until the full dependency tree is mapped.

### Step 3: Map data flows

For any `fetch()` or `useSWR()` calls in client code:
- Extract the API path (e.g., `/api/food-log`)
- Find the corresponding route handler in `src/app/api/`
- Add the route handler AND its lib module dependencies

### Step 4: Find related files

For each source file `src/path/file.ts`:
- Test file: `src/path/__tests__/file.test.ts`
- Loading skeleton: `src/app/**/loading.tsx` (for page routes)

### Step 5: Output file manifest

List all discovered files grouped by role:
- **Pages/Layouts** — entry point routes
- **Components** — UI components
- **Hooks** — custom React hooks
- **API Routes** — server-side handlers
- **Lib Modules** — business logic
- **Types** — shared type definitions
- **Tests** — test files
- **Config** — loading.tsx, middleware, etc.

Output the manifest before proceeding so the user can verify scope.

## Read All Files

Read EVERY file in the manifest. Cross-domain reasoning requires holding all related code in context simultaneously.

Read in dependency order: types → lib → hooks → API routes → components → pages → tests.

## Deep Analysis

Read [references/deep-review-checklist.md](references/deep-review-checklist.md) for the comprehensive cross-domain checklist.

**Critical instruction:** Do NOT analyze each file in isolation. Reason about how files INTERACT. For each finding, trace the impact across the full stack.

### Analysis approach

Walk through the user's journey for this feature:
1. **Arrival** — User navigates to the screen. What loads? What can fail during load?
2. **Interaction** — User takes actions. What state changes? What API calls fire? What race conditions exist?
3. **Server processing** — What validates input? What can fail? How do errors propagate back?
4. **AI integration** — If the feature involves Claude API: trace input preparation → API call → tool loop → response validation → client rendering. Check tool definitions, system prompts, agentic loop correctness, and response validation (see checklist section 9).
5. **UI update** — Does the component handle all response shapes? All error types? Loading states?
6. **Edge cases** — Empty data, concurrent actions, stale cache, network failure, large payloads, back/forward navigation

### Findings format

For each finding, record:
- **Severity:** [critical] | [high] | [medium] | [low]
- **Domain:** code | security | ux | performance
- **Location:** file:line (and related files if cross-cutting)
- **Description:** What's wrong
- **Impact:** Who is affected and how
- **Cross-domain note:** How this interacts with other parts of the system (if applicable)

## Create Linear Issues

For each finding, check against existing Backlog issues. Skip if a matching issue already exists.

Use `mcp__linear__create_issue`:

```
team: [discovered team name]
state: "Backlog"
title: "[Brief description]"
priority: [1-4] (critical=1, high=2, medium=3, low=4)
labels: [mapped label]
description: (format below)
```

**Issue description format:**

```
**Problem:**
[1-2 sentence problem statement]

**Context:**
[File paths with line numbers — include ALL related files, not just the primary location]

**Impact:**
[Who is affected and how — trace the user-facing consequence]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Verifiable criterion]
- [ ] [Another criterion]
```

**Label mapping:**

| Finding domain | Linear label |
|---------------|-------------|
| code (bugs, logic, async, edge cases) | Bug |
| security (auth, validation, XSS) | Security |
| ux (loading, feedback, accessibility, responsive) | Improvement |
| performance (re-renders, bundle, images, CWV) | Performance |
| convention (CLAUDE.md violation) | Convention |

## Termination

Output this report and STOP:

```
## Deep Review: $ARGUMENTS

**Files analyzed:** N
**Scope:** [list of file groups with counts]

### Findings (ordered by severity)

| # | ID | Severity | Domain | Title |
|---|-----|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | FOO-XX | Critical | code | Brief title |
| 2 | FOO-XX | High | ux | Brief title |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

X issues created | Duplicates skipped: N

### Cross-cutting Observations

[Systemic patterns observed across the feature — e.g., "error handling is inconsistent between the API route and client component" or "loading states exist but don't cover all async paths"]
```

Do not ask follow-up questions. Do not offer to fix issues.
