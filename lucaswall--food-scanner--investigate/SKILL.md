Investigate issues and report findings. Does NOT create plans or modify code.

## Purpose

- Investigate reported issues (API errors, wrong data, unexpected behavior)
- Debug deployment or runtime issues using Railway logs
- Query Sentry for errors, traces, performance data, and AI/LLM usage
- Analyze codebase to understand behavior
- Examine configuration and environment issues
- **Report findings only** - user decides next steps

## Sentry

Read CLAUDE.md SENTRY section for organization, project, and region URL. Always pass these to Sentry MCP tools:
- `organizationSlug` / `projectSlugOrId` / `projectSlug` — from CLAUDE.md SENTRY table
- `regionUrl` — from CLAUDE.md SENTRY table

Environment mappings are also in CLAUDE.md SENTRY section.

### Which Sentry tool to use

| Goal | Tool | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| List matching issues | `search_issues` | "unresolved errors in production" |
| Issue details + stacktrace | `get_issue_details` | Pass issue ID like `FOOD-SCANNER-1` |
| Count errors or search events | `search_events` | "how many errors today", "database errors from last hour" |
| Filter events within one issue | `search_issue_events` | "events from last hour" on issue X |
| View a trace | `get_trace_details` | Pass 32-char hex trace ID |
| Tag distribution for an issue | `get_issue_tag_values` | tagKey: "environment", "url", "browser" |
| AI root cause analysis | `analyze_issue_with_seer` | Deep analysis with code fix suggestions |

### Issue status filtering

**CRITICAL: Default to unresolved issues.** Unless the user explicitly asks for resolved, ignored, or all issues:
- Always include "unresolved" in `search_issues` queries (e.g., "unresolved errors in production")
- After fetching issue lists, check each issue's `status` field — skip any that are `resolved` or `ignored`
- When `get_issue_details` returns an issue, check its status before investigating further — don't waste effort on already-resolved issues
- If all matching issues are resolved/ignored, report that to the user rather than analyzing stale issues

The `search_issues` tool returns a `status` field per issue (`unresolved`, `resolved`, `ignored`). Always read it.

### Sentry investigation patterns

**Error investigation:**
1. `search_issues` — find matching **unresolved** issues by description or symptoms
2. `get_issue_details` — get stacktrace, affected users, frequency — **verify status is unresolved**
3. `get_issue_tag_values` — check environment/release/url distribution
4. `search_issue_events` — filter to specific timeframe or environment
5. `analyze_issue_with_seer` — get AI root cause analysis with code fixes

**Performance investigation:**
1. `search_events` — query spans: "slow API requests", "p95 response time"
2. `get_trace_details` — inspect a specific trace for bottlenecks

**Claude API investigation:**
1. `search_events` — query AI spans: "anthropic API calls", "token usage by model", "slow Claude responses"
2. `get_trace_details` — trace a full request through Claude tool_use loops

**Trend investigation:**
1. `search_events` — "count of errors today vs yesterday", "error rate this week"
2. `search_issues` — "new issues in the last 24 hours"

## Railway Environments

This project has two Railway environments. **Always determine the target environment before pulling logs or deployments.**

| Environment | Railway name | Branch | URL | Fitbit API |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Production** | `production` | `release` | `food.lucaswall.me` | Live |
| **Staging** | `staging` | `main` | `food-test.lucaswall.me` | Dry-run |

**How to determine the target environment:**
1. If user explicitly says "production", "prod", "live", or "food.lucaswall.me" → use `production`
2. If user explicitly says "staging", "stage", "dev", or "food-test.lucaswall.me" → use `staging`
3. If user mentions a specific branch: `release` → `production`, `main` → `staging`
4. If ambiguous, **ask the user** which environment to investigate before pulling logs

**CRITICAL: Always pass `environment` explicitly to Railway MCP tools.** The Railway CLI may be linked to any environment — do NOT rely on the default. Every call to `get-logs`, `list-deployments`, or `list-variables` MUST include the `environment` parameter matching the target.

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS should describe what to investigate:
- What happened vs what was expected
- Error messages or unexpected values
- Which environment (production or staging) — if not specified, ask
- Sentry issue ID or URL if the user provides one
- Deployment ID if it's a deployment issue
- Any context that helps narrow the scope

## Investigation Workflow

### Step 1: Classify the Investigation Type

Based on $ARGUMENTS, determine what you're investigating:

| Category | Indicators | Primary Tools |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Error** | Exception, crash, 500, unhandled error | Sentry issues/events, Railway logs, Codebase |
| **API** | Wrong response, missing data, error codes | Sentry traces, Codebase, Railway logs |
| **Deployment** | Service down, build failures, runtime errors | Railway MCP, Sentry events |
| **Performance** | Slow responses, timeouts, resource issues | Sentry spans/traces, Railway logs |
| **Data** | Wrong values, missing records, unexpected state | Codebase, Sentry events |
| **Auth** | Login failures, permission errors, token issues | Sentry issues, Codebase, Railway logs |
| **AI/Claude** | Bad analysis, high latency, token waste | Sentry AI spans, Codebase |
| **General** | Unknown cause, need exploration | All available tools |

### Step 2: Gather Evidence

**Start with Sentry** for most investigations — it provides the richest context (stacktraces, traces, frequency, affected environments):
1. `search_issues` to find related **unresolved** errors (always include "unresolved" in the query)
2. `get_issue_details` for stacktrace and metadata — **verify status is unresolved before deep-diving**
3. `search_events` for counts, trends, or individual events
4. `get_trace_details` to trace a request through the system

**For Codebase Analysis:**
- Use Grep/Glob for specific searches
- Use Task tool with `subagent_type=Explore` for broader exploration
- Read relevant source files, configs, and tests

**For Deployment Issues (via Railway MCP):**
1. **Determine target environment** from $ARGUMENTS (see "Railway Environments" above). If unclear, ask user.
2. Check Railway MCP status
3. List services to find affected service
4. List recent deployments with statuses — pass `environment: "<target>"` explicitly
5. Get deployment and build logs — pass `environment: "<target>"` explicitly
6. Search logs for errors using filters (e.g., `@level:error`)

**For API Issues:**
- Check Sentry for related errors and traces first
- Trace the request flow through the codebase
- Check route handlers, middleware, and data access layers
- Look for error handling gaps

**For Claude/AI Issues:**
- `search_events` to find AI spans (Anthropic calls)
- Check token usage, latency, model info
- Cross-reference with codebase prompts and tool definitions

### Step 3: Form Conclusions

After gathering evidence, determine:

1. **Root Cause Identified** - You found what's causing the issue
2. **Root Cause Suspected** - Strong hypothesis but not 100% certain
3. **Multiple Possibilities** - Several potential causes, need more info
4. **Nothing Wrong Found** - Investigation shows system working correctly
5. **Cannot Determine** - Insufficient information to conclude

## Investigation Report Format

Write findings to the conversation (NOT to a file):

```
## Investigation Report

**Subject:** [What was investigated]
**Environment:** [production | staging | codebase-only]
**Conclusion:** [Root Cause Identified | Suspected | Multiple Possibilities | Nothing Wrong | Cannot Determine]

### Context
- **MCPs used:** [list MCPs accessed]
- **Sentry issues reviewed:** [issue IDs if applicable]
- **Railway environment queried:** [production | staging | N/A]
- **Files examined:** [list key files checked]
- **Logs reviewed:** [deployment IDs, time ranges if applicable]

### Evidence
[What you found - be specific with data points, log excerpts, stacktraces, file contents]

### Findings

[Explain what you discovered. If root cause found, explain it clearly.
If nothing wrong, explain what was checked and why it appears correct.
If uncertain, list possibilities ranked by likelihood.]

### Recommendations (Optional)
[Only if you have specific suggestions - do NOT write a fix plan]
```

## Deployment Debugging Guidelines

When investigating deployment issues (via Railway MCP):

1. **Identify target environment** - Determine `production` or `staging` from user context (see "Railway Environments" section)
2. **Check status first** - Verify MCP access
3. **List recent deployments** - Get deployment IDs and statuses (pass `environment` param)
4. **Get targeted logs** - Search for errors using filters (pass `environment` param)
5. **Look for patterns** - Repeated errors, timing correlations
6. **Check configuration** - Environment variables, settings (pass `environment` param to `list-variables`)

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| $ARGUMENTS is vague | Ask for more specific details |
| CLAUDE.md doesn't exist | Continue with codebase-only investigation |
| MCP not available | Skip that MCP, note in report what couldn't be checked |
| Sentry has no matching issues | Note in report — may be a new/unreported issue |
| File/resource not found | Document in report (may be relevant) |
| Cannot reproduce issue | Document steps taken, request more context |
| Logs unavailable | Note in report, suggest alternative approaches |

## Rules

- **Report only** - Do NOT modify source code or files
- **No plans** - Do NOT write PLANS.md or fix plans
- **Start with Sentry** - For error/performance investigations, check Sentry before Railway logs
- **Unresolved only** - Default to unresolved issues. Always check issue status before investigating. Do not analyze resolved or ignored issues unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Explicit environment** - ALWAYS pass the `environment` parameter to Railway MCP tools; never rely on CLI defaults
- **Sentry constants** - ALWAYS pass `organizationSlug: "lucas-wall"` and `regionUrl: "https://us.sentry.io"` to Sentry tools
- **Be thorough** - Check multiple sources before concluding
- **Be specific** - Include exact values, line numbers, timestamps, Sentry issue IDs
- **Be honest** - If uncertain, say so; if nothing wrong, say so

## What NOT to Do

1. **Don't create PLANS.md** - This skill only reports
2. **Don't modify code** - Investigation is read-only
3. **Don't assume MCPs** - Discover from CLAUDE.md
4. **Don't conclude prematurely** - Gather sufficient evidence first
5. **Don't force findings** - "Nothing wrong" is a valid conclusion

## Termination

When you finish investigating, output the investigation report.

**If bugs or issues were found that need fixing**, end with:

```
---
Investigation complete. Issues found that may need fixing.

Would you like me to create a fix plan? Say 'yes' or run `/plan-fix` with the context above.
(Fix plans will create Linear issues with FOO- prefix in Todo state)
```

**If nothing wrong was found or no fix needed**, end with:

```
---
Investigation complete.

To take action based on these findings:
- For bug fixes: Use `plan-fix` with this context (creates Linear issues in Todo)
- For feature changes: Use `plan-inline` with specific request (creates Linear issues in Todo)
- For further investigation: Provide more details and run investigate again
```

Do not offer to implement fixes directly. Report findings and offer skill chaining if appropriate.
