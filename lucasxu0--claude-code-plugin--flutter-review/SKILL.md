# Flutter Code Review

**This skill is directly invocable. See [workflow.md](workflow.md) for the complete 5-step execution strategy.**

Expert knowledge for identifying critical bugs, anti-patterns, and code quality issues in Flutter/Dart code.

## Execution Instructions

When invoked directly (e.g., via /flutter-review command):

1. Follow the 5-step workflow in [workflow.md](workflow.md)
2. Apply the priority-based checks defined below
3. Generate a comprehensive review report
4. Offer to automatically fix issues found

## Priority-Based Analysis

### P0 - Critical (Must Fix Before Merge)

Issues that cause crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities, or visual bugs.

#### Null Safety Violations

**Force Unwrap Without Checks** (variable!, expression!.property)

- Risk: Runtime crash with "Null check operator used on a null value"
- Fix: Extract nullable values to local variables, check for null, then use non-null variable
- **Preferred Pattern:** Extract property to local variable → check null → use promoted non-null variable
- **Avoid:** Checking widget.property == null then using widget.property with ! operator
- → Details: reference.md#avoid_non_null_assertion

**Unsafe Nullable Access**

- Risk: Null pointer exceptions when accessing properties without checks
- Fix: Add null checks before property access
- → Details: reference.md#missing_null_safety

**Unsafe Type Casts** (value as Type)

- Risk: Type cast errors at runtime
- Fix: Use pattern matching or check with is operator first
- → Details: reference.md#unsafe_type_casts

#### Flutter Lifecycle Issues

**setState Without Mounted Check**

- Risk: setState() called after dispose() crashes app
- Fix: Add if (!mounted) return; before setState in async callbacks
- → Details: reference.md#avoid_mounted_in_setstate

**State Modifications After Disposal**

- Risk: Memory leaks and unexpected behavior
- Fix: Check mounted or cancel operations in dispose
- → Details: reference.md#state_after_disposal

#### Memory Leaks

**Resources That Must Be Disposed:**
TextEditingController, AnimationController, ScrollController, TabController, PageController, FocusNode, StreamSubscription, Timer, any class with addListener() called

**Detection:** Check if controllers/subscriptions created in fields or initState have corresponding dispose() calls. Verify ALL resources disposed, not just presence of dispose method.

- → Details: reference.md#dispose_class_fields

#### Logic Errors

**Incorrect Conditional Logic**

- || vs && confusion, missing null checks in compounds, negation errors
- → Details: reference.md#logic_errors_conditionals

**Missing Error Handling**

- API calls, file operations, JSON parsing without try-catch
- → Details: reference.md#missing_error_handling

**Infinite Loops**

- Loops without termination or where condition never changes
- → Details: reference.md#infinite_loops

**Race Conditions**

- Multiple async operations modifying same state without guards
- → Details: reference.md#race_conditions

#### Bloc State Synchronization Issues

**Only check when flutter_bloc or bloc in dependencies.**

**BlocListener/BlocConsumer Missing Initial State**

- Risk: Widget state (TextEditingController, variables) not initialized from bloc's initial state
- Problem: Listener callbacks only fire on state changes, not initial state. If bloc emits state before widget creation, initial state is missed
- Fix: Initialize widget state in initState() from current bloc state, AND have listener for updates
- → Details: reference.md#bloc_missing_initial_state

#### Text Overflow in Flex Layouts

**Text Without Constraints in Row/Column**

- Risk: RenderFlex overflow errors, visual bugs, unusable UI
- Fix: Wrap Text in Flexible/Expanded widget AND/OR add overflow handling (TextOverflow.ellipsis)
- → Details: reference.md#text_overflow_flex

---

### P1 - Important (Should Fix)

Issues causing logic bugs and maintainability problems.

#### Collection Equality

**Using == on Collections** (list1 == list2, map1 == map2)

- Problem: Dart uses reference equality, always false for different instances
- Fix: Use package:collection - ListEquality().equals(), MapEquality().equals(), or DeepCollectionEquality().equals()
- Exception: const collections (same instance)
- → Details: reference.md#avoid_collection_equality_checks

#### Code Complexity

**Deep Nesting** (>4 levels)

- Problem: Reduces readability, increases cognitive load
- Fix: Extract methods, use early returns, guard clauses
- → Details: reference.md#deep_nesting

**Long Methods** (>100 lines)

- Problem: Violates Single Responsibility Principle
- Fix: Break into smaller focused methods
- → Details: reference.md#long_methods

**Long Build Methods** (>50 lines)

- Problem: Too much UI logic in build method, hard to maintain
- Fix: Extract to buildWidget helpers (buildHeader, buildBody) or create separate widget files
- → Details: reference.md#long_build_methods

#### Widget Organization

**Multiple Widget Definitions Per File**

- Problem: Reduces code organization, testability, and reusability
- Fix: Each widget class must be in its own file (e.g., UserCard in user_card.dart)
- **No exceptions**: Even private (`_Widget`) or small helper widgets should be extracted
- → Details: reference.md#multiple_widgets_per_file

#### Late Modifier Usage

**Avoid Late Keyword**

- Risk: Defers initialization to runtime, can cause LateInitializationError
- Fix: Initialize in constructor, use nullable types, or required parameters
- Exception: DI frameworks with guaranteed initialization
- → Details: reference.md#avoid_late_keyword

#### Bloc Anti-Patterns

**Only check when flutter_bloc or bloc in dependencies.**

**Public Fields in BLoC**

- Problem: Breaks encapsulation, allows external state modification
- Fix: Make fields private, expose through state
- → Details: reference.md#bloc_public_fields

**Public Methods in BLoC**

- Problem: BLoCs should only respond to events
- Fix: Create events and use add() instead
- → Details: reference.md#bloc_public_methods

**Mutable Events**

- Problem: Events should be immutable data
- Fix: Add @immutable, make fields final, use const constructors
- → Details: reference.md#bloc_mutable_events

**Non-Sealed States**

- Problem: Can't exhaustively pattern match
- Fix: Use sealed class for state base, final class for implementations
- → Details: reference.md#bloc_non_sealed_states

#### Provider Anti-Patterns

**Only check when provider in dependencies.**

**context.read() in Build**

- Problem: Won't rebuild when provider changes
- Fix: Use context.watch() for reactive data
- → Details: reference.md#provider_read_in_build

**Old Provider Syntax** (Provider.of<Type>(context, listen: true))

- Problem: Outdated, less readable
- Fix: Use context.watch() or context.read()
- → Details: reference.md#provider_old_syntax

**Missing Disposal in ChangeNotifier**

- Problem: Memory leaks from undisposed resources
- Fix: Override dispose() and clean up all resources
- → Details: reference.md#provider_missing_disposal

#### Logic Issues

**Incorrect Operators**

- Using = instead of == in conditions, comparing incompatible types
- → Details: reference.md#incorrect_operators

**Missing Edge Cases**

- No empty collection checks before .first/.last, no bounds checking
- → Details: reference.md#missing_edge_cases

**Off-By-One Errors**

- Loop conditions with <= instead of < for length
- → Details: reference.md#off_by_one_errors

---

### P2 - Code Quality (Nice to Have)

Improvements for maintainability.

#### Magic Numbers

**Hardcoded Numbers Without Context**

- Exceptions: 0, 1, -1, obvious widget dimensions (padding: 16)
- Fix: Define as named constants
- → Details: reference.md#magic_numbers

#### TODO/FIXME Comments

**Markers for Incomplete Work**

- Patterns: // TODO:, // FIXME:, // HACK:
- Action: Track and address before merge
- → Details: reference.md#todo_comments

#### Function Ordering

**Private Functions After Public Functions**

- Problem: Private functions placed before public ones reduces readability and makes it harder to understand the public API
- Fix: Move all private methods (starting with _) after public methods
- Widget-specific order: initState → other lifecycle methods → dispose → build → public methods → private methods
- → Details: reference.md#function_ordering

#### Long Classes (>500 lines)

**Classes Exceeding 500 Lines**

- Problem: Violates Single Responsibility, may contain dead code
- Fix: Split into multiple classes, extract to mixins/utilities
- Action: Review for unused methods, commented code, duplicate logic
- → Details: reference.md#long_classes

#### Moderate Nesting (3-4 levels)

**Nesting Depth 3-4**

- Consider simplification for readability
- → Details: reference.md#moderate_nesting

## Dependency-Specific Knowledge

### Bloc Pattern Detection

**Trigger:** flutter_bloc or bloc in pubspec.yaml

**Key Principles:**

- State is immutable and sealed
- Events are immutable
- No public methods (only event handlers)
- No public fields (only private state)
- UI never contains business logic

→ See reference.md#bloc_pattern for state/event patterns

### Provider Pattern Detection

**Trigger:** provider in pubspec.yaml

**Key Principles:**

- Use context.watch() for reactive rebuilds
- Use context.read() only for one-time reads (not in build)
- Use context.select() for performance optimization
- Always dispose resources in ChangeNotifier

→ See reference.md#provider_pattern for usage patterns

---

## Context Awareness

### When NOT to Flag

**Test Files:**

- More lenient with force unwraps in test setup
- Focus on logic errors, not style

**Generated Code:**

- Files matching _.g.dart, _.freezed.dart, \*.gr.dart
- Skip entirely - will be regenerated

**Intentional Patterns:**

- Type check before cast (e.g., `if (x is String) { x.length; }`)
- Controlled environments after validation (e.g., validated user input)

**Note:** Even with null check immediately before force unwrap, prefer extracting to local variable for type promotion instead of using the ! operator.

### When TO Flag Even If...

**Pattern is common:**

- Common doesn't mean correct
- Flag reference equality on collections even if widespread

**"It works":**

- Working code can still have bugs
- Flag potential issues even if not currently crashing

**Dispose exists but incomplete:**

- If new controllers added but not in dispose
- Check ALL resources, not just presence of dispose method

**Widget is private or small:**

- Flag ALL widget definitions in same file (except StatefulWidget's State class)
- Private (`_Widget`) does not exempt from one-widget-per-file rule
- "Small" size does not exempt from one-widget-per-file rule
- Every widget class deserves its own file for testability and organization

## Review Output Format

### Report Structure

**Summary:**

- Count by priority (P0: X, P1: Y, P2: Z)
- Clear status (Pass / Must Fix / Recommended)
- Overall recommendation (🔴 BLOCK / 🟡 REVIEW NEEDED / 🟢 APPROVED)

**Issue Format:**

- File path:line_number
- Issue type and priority
- Problem explanation
- Current code snippet (with context)
- Fixed code snippet
- Benefit of fix

**Organization:**

- P0 first (most critical)
- Within priority, group by type
- Use tables for many similar issues (>3)
- Detailed format for complex issues

### Recommendation Guidelines

🔴 **BLOCK** - Any P0 issues present (must fix before merge)
🟡 **REVIEW NEEDED** - No P0, but P1 issues present (should fix)
🟢 **APPROVED** - No P0 or P1, only P2 optional improvements

---

## Analysis Efficiency

**Focus on Changed Code:**

- Analyze additions and modifications (+ in diff)
- Use surrounding context from diff
- Don't review entire codebase

**Selective Deep Dives:**
Read full files only when:

- Diff context insufficient
- Need to verify disposal (new controllers/streams added)
- Need class structure or imports

**File Type Guides Analysis:**

- Widgets: Lifecycle, mounted, dispose
- BLoCs: Encapsulation, events, states
- Providers: Disposal, context usage
- Models: Immutability, equality
- Services: Error handling, async patterns

---

## Key Principles

1. **Safety First** - P0 issues can crash apps, prioritize these
2. **Be Specific** - Always provide file:line, code snippets, fixes
3. **Avoid False Positives** - When uncertain, don't flag or mark P2
4. **Context Matters** - Understand intent before flagging
5. **Actionable Feedback** - Every issue needs clear, copy-paste ready fix
6. **Respect Patterns** - Understand project architecture before suggesting changes
