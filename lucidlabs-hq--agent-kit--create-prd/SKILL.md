# Create PRD: Generate Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on conversation context. This PRD will serve as the single source of truth for project-specific requirements.

**Important:** The PRD is the ONLY project-specific file. All other Agent Kit files are reusable.

## Output File

Write the PRD to: `.claude/PRD.md`

If a PRD already exists, ask before overwriting.

## Before Starting

### 1. Gather Project Context

Ask the user for (if not already discussed):

- **Project Name:** What is this project called?
- **Client/Domain:** Who is this for? What industry?
- **Core Problem:** What problem are we solving?
- **Target Users:** Who will use this?
- **MVP Scope:** What's the minimum viable product?

### 2. Reference Agent Kit Standards

Read these files to ensure PRD aligns with our standards:

- `CLAUDE.md` - Tech stack and code standards
- `.claude/reference/architecture.md` - Architecture patterns
- `.claude/reference/design-system.md` - UI/UX standards
- `.claude/reference/mastra-best-practices.md` - AI agent patterns

## PRD Structure

Create a well-structured PRD with the following sections:

---

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Product Requirements Document

> **Note:** This PRD contains project-specific requirements.
> All technical standards are inherited from Agent Kit (`CLAUDE.md`).

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft | In Progress | Production-Ready
**Last Updated:** [Date]

- Fill in reasonable assumptions where details are missing
- Maintain consistency across sections
- Ensure alignment with Agent Kit standards

### 3. Write the PRD

- Use clear, professional language
- Include concrete examples
- Use markdown formatting (headings, lists, code blocks, checkboxes)
- Keep Executive Summary concise but comprehensive

### 4. Quality Checks

- All required sections present
- User stories have clear benefits
- MVP scope is realistic
- Aligns with Agent Kit tech stack (CLAUDE.md)
- Implementation phases are actionable
- Success criteria are measurable

## After Creating PRD

### 1. Update PROJECT-STATUS.md

```markdown
## Project Info
- **Project:** [Name]
- **PRD:** Created [date]
- **Phase:** Planning
```

### 2. Output Confirmation

Provide:
1. Confirm the PRD was written to `.claude/PRD.md`
2. Brief summary of contents
3. Assumptions made (if any)
4. Suggested next steps

### 3. Next Steps

Recommend:
```
1. Review the PRD and refine if needed
2. Run /prime to load project context
3. Start planning with /plan-feature [first-feature]
```

## Notes

- If critical information is missing, ask clarifying questions BEFORE generating
- The PRD should be project-specific; technical standards come from CLAUDE.md
- For AI agent projects, emphasize the Agent Specification section
- For CRUD apps, emphasize Feature Specification and API sections
