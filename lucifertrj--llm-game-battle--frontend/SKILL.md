## MCP Server Integration

### Sequential Thinking MCP

Use for complex frontend reasoning:

**Component Architecture:**
```
Think step-by-step about the GameBoard component:
Step 1: What props does it receive? (players, gameType, onBack)
Step 2: What state does it need? (from useGameLogic hook)
Step 3: How should the grid be rendered? (conditional on gameType)
Step 4: How to handle winner overlay? (conditional rendering)
Step 5: How to display real-time logs? (scrollable list with auto-scroll)
```

**State Management Debugging:**
```
Analyze this state synchronization issue:
Step 1: What is the expected state flow?
Step 2: When does state get out of sync?
Step 3: Are there stale closures in useEffect?
Step 4: Should we use useRef for non-reactive values?
Step 5: How to prevent race conditions?
```

**Performance Optimization:**
```
Optimize rendering performance:
Step 1: What components re-render unnecessarily?
Step 2: Where should useMemo/useCallback be applied?
Step 3: Are there memory leaks in cleanup functions?
Step 4: How can we reduce bundle size?
Step 5: Should we implement code splitting?
```

### Qdrant MCP Server

Store and retrieve backend-specific knowledge:

**Storage Keys:**
```
llm-arena:backend:progress:{timestamp}         # Progress snapshots
```

- After the completion of every task store the progress in Qdrant vector store using **qdrant-store**
- Save the progress in the format progress.md
- The file needs to include: TODO TASK, IN PROGRESS TASK, COMPLETED TASK


### Context7 MCP

Pull live documentation for:
- **React:** New hooks, server components, use() hook, transitions
- **Vite:** Configuration, plugins, HMR, build optimization
- **Tailwind CSS:** New utilities, configuration changes, dark mode
- **Framer Motion:** Animation patterns, layout animations, gestures

**Example:**
```
Context7: Get React useEffect cleanup patterns
Context7: Get Tailwind CSS animate-in utilities
Context7: Get Framer Motion layout animation examples
```
