# Code Style

On top of ensuring you comply with the Ultracite/Biome linting rules, here are some additional preferred rules.

## Components

For component props, always accept a single props variable in the function signature and destructure it afterwards.

```tsx
type NavbarProps = {
  links: string[];
};

function Navbar(props: NavbarProps) {
  const { links } = props;
}
```

## Functions

Prefer functions over anonymous functions.

For function parameters, prefer a single object parameter with named keys. The function should only take the single parameter in the function signature and destructure it afterwards.

```ts
type GetUserOptions = {
  userId: string;
};

function getUser(opts: GetUserOptions) {
  const { userId } = opts;
  return userId;
}
```

## Existing Typed Functions

The exception to the destructuring rules is when you are working with an already typed function that is being passed as a parameter. For example it's okay to do the following.

```ts
export const Route = createFileRoute("/_with-user/app/")({
  component: RouteComponent,
  loader({ context }) {
    const { user } = context;

    return {
      user,
    };
  },
});
```

`loader` is already typed with the object so you can just pull out the primary keys from the parameter. All sub-keys should still be destructured.
