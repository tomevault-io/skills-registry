# ORPC

We use the RPC version of ORPC. https://orpc.dev/docs/getting-started

## Files

- `src/server/handler.ts` - ORPC RPC handler with error logging
- `src/server/index.ts` - ORPC middleware (`baseOs`, `withUserOs`, `withoutUserOs`)
- `src/server/routes/index.ts` - ORPC route definitions (currently empty)
- `src/server/client/index.ts` - Isomorphic ORPC client (server/client)
- `src/server/utils/get-session.ts` - Cached session getter

## Routing

All routes be properly organized in `src/server/routes`. The file path should always match the RPC path. Every RPC function should be a folder containing an `index.ts`. Every sub-folder should also contain an `index.ts` which reexports the scoped routes.

```ts
// src/server/routes/posts/list/index.ts
export const list = withUserOs.handler();

// src/server/routes/posts/index.ts
import { list } from "./list";

export const postsRoutes = {
  list,
};

// src/server/routes/index.ts
import { postsRoutes } from "./posts";

export const routes = {
  posts: postsRoutes,
};
```

## Functions

ALWAYS use one of the `os` variables defined in `src/server/index.ts` depending on the data you need. If there is recurring logic consider update the existing os to deduplicate that work or create a new one. For example if you have a concept of organizations, consider making an `export const withOrganizationOs = withUserOs.use(withOrganizationMiddleware);`
