# Git Commit Message Convention

Follow these rules when generating git commit messages.

## Format

All commit messages must be in English and follow this format:

1.  **Header**: The first line should contain the change type (feat/fix/chore/build/ci...) and a summary.
2.  **Body**: The second line must be empty (required only if Details are present).
3.  **Details**: Subsequent lines should use a numbered list to describe specific changes. **OMIT** this section (and the empty Body line) if there is only one change point.

## Example

### Multiple Changes

```
feat: add new feature for display control

1. Add DisplayController class
2. Update configuration parsing logic
3. Add unit tests for new functionality
```

### Single Change

```
fix: correct typo in README
```

## Command Line Usage

When performing the commit via command line:

- For **multiple changes**, use a single `-m` flag with an open quote to create a multi-line message. Press `Enter` to create new lines (including the required empty line after the header) and close the quote at the end.
- For **single change**, use a standard single-line commit message.

```bash
# Multiple changes
git commit -m "feat: add new feature for display control

1. Add DisplayController class
2. Update configuration parsing logic"

# Single change
git commit -m "fix: correct typo in README"
```

## When to Use

- When the user asks to commit changes.
- When generating a commit message for a pull request or commit.

## Constraints

- **DO NOT** execute `git push` automatically after committing. Wait for explicit user instruction to push.
