# Cursor Rules Standards

## Overview
This document outlines the standards for creating and maintaining cursor rules within the project. These standards ensure consistency and maximize the effectiveness of rules for AI assistance.

## Rule Location

All cursor rules **MUST** be stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory with the `.mdc` extension:

```
.cursor/
  └── rules/
      ├── example-rule.mdc
      ├── component-guidelines.mdc
      └── api-standards.mdc
```

## Rule Required Fields

Every cursor rule file **MUST** include the following in its frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: A concise, clear description of the rule's purpose
globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"] # Patterns for files the rule applies to
alwaysApply: false # Whether the rule should always be applied
---
```

### Required Fields Explanation

1. **description**: A clear, concise explanation of the rule's purpose. This helps both humans and AI understand when to apply the rule.
   - Must be under 100 characters
   - Should clearly communicate the rule's intent

2. **globs**: File patterns that the rule applies to. Can be specific or general.
   - Use standard glob patterns
   - Be as specific as possible to avoid unnecessary rule application

3. **alwaysApply**: Boolean indicating if the rule should be applied automatically.
   - `true`: Rule is applied to all matching files automatically
   - `false`: Rule is only applied when explicitly referenced

## Rule Content Structure

Rules should follow a consistent structure:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title at the top
2. **Overview**: Brief summary of the rule's purpose
3. **Guidelines**: Specific instructions, organized into sections
4. **Examples**: Practical examples showing correct and incorrect approaches
5. **References**: Any relevant references to external documentation or internal resources

## Example Rule

```markdown
---
description: Code formatting standards for JavaScript and TypeScript files
globs: ["**/*.js", "**/*.ts", "**/*.jsx", "**/*.tsx"]
alwaysApply: true
---
# JavaScript and TypeScript Formatting Standards

## Overview
This rule defines formatting standards for JavaScript and TypeScript files to ensure consistency across the codebase.

## Guidelines
1. Use 2-space indentation
2. Use semicolons at the end of statements
3. Prefer single quotes for strings
...

## Examples
Good:
```js
const greeting = 'Hello';
console.log(greeting);
```

Bad:
```js
const greeting = "Hello"
console.log(greeting)
```
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Rules should address specific concerns rather than trying to cover too much ground
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why a rule exists, not just what it requires
3. **Include Examples**: Show both correct and incorrect implementations
4. **Keep Updated**: Review and update rules as project standards evolve
5. **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't duplicate information available in other rules
6. **Use Clear Language**: Write rules in clear, direct language

## Rule Maintenance

Rules should be reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant and accurate. When updating rules:

1. Document significant changes in commit messages
2. Update the description if the rule's purpose changes
3. Update globs as file structure changes
4. Consider the impact on existing code and AI guidance

## Updating Cursor Rules

**IMPORTANT**: When updating cursor rules, you must follow this specific process:

1. **Delete the existing rule file** - Editing a rule file in place may not propagate changes correctly
2. **Create a new file with the same name** - After deletion, create a new file with the same name and updated content
3. **Verify the rule is applied** - Check that the new rule is being correctly applied by referencing it explicitly

This delete-then-create approach is necessary because the cursor rules system may cache rules, and editing in place can lead to inconsistent behavior. Examples:

```bash
# To update a rule:
rm .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
# Then create a new file with the updated content
touch .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
# Edit the new file with your changes
```

If you're unsure if your rule update took effect, you can check by explicitly referencing the rule in a query.
