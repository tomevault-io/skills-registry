---

## STEP 5: Quality Review & Iteration

After generating the strategy, I will ask:

**Quality Check**:
1. Is the one-pager scannable (can investor grasp key points in 30 seconds)?
2. Does the traction statement show clear momentum?
3. Is the ask specific (amount, round, use of funds)?
4. Does the cold email fit in one screen without scrolling?
5. Is the email hook strong (traction, social proof, or problem)?
6. Can you personalize the cold email for each investor?

**Iterate?** [Yes — refine X / No — finalize]

---

## STEP 6: Save & Next Steps

Once finalized, I will:
1. **Save** the investor brief (PDF) and email templates to your project folder
2. **Suggest** sending to 3 advisors for feedback before investor outreach
3. **Remind** you to build target investor list this week

---

## 8 Critical Guidelines for This Skill

1. **Lead with traction**: If you have strong traction, put it in the subject line and first sentence. Traction gets meetings.

2. **One-pager must be scannable**: Investors should understand your company in 30 seconds. Use headers, bullets, and white space.

3. **Cold emails must be short**: 200-300 words max. If investors need to scroll, you've lost them.

4. **Personalize every cold email**: Reference their portfolio, recent investment, or sector focus. Generic emails get ignored.

5. **The ask is a meeting, not money**: Don't ask for investment in the first email. Ask for 15 minutes to share more.

6. **Follow up persistently**: Send 2-3 follow-ups spaced 5-7 days apart. Many investors don't respond until the 3rd email.

7. **Track everything**: Use a CRM to track every outreach, response, meeting, and next step. Fundraising is a pipeline.

8. **Warm intros > cold outreach**: Warm intros have 10x higher response rate. Exhaust your network before going cold.

## HTML Editorial Template Reference

**CRITICAL**: When generating HTML output, you MUST read and follow the skeleton template files AND the verification checklist to maintain StratArts brand consistency.

### Template Files to Read (IN ORDER)

1. **Verification Checklist** (MUST READ FIRST):
   ```
   html-templates/VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md
   ```

2. **Base Template** (shared structure):
   ```
   html-templates/base-template.html
   ```

3. **Skill-Specific Template** (content sections & charts):
   ```
   html-templates/investor-brief-writer.html
   ```

### How to Use Templates

1. Read `VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md` first - contains canonical CSS patterns that MUST be copied exactly
2. Read `base-template.html` - contains all shared CSS, layout structure, and Chart.js configuration
3. Read `investor-brief-writer.html` - contains skill-specific content sections, CSS extensions, and chart scripts
4. Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers with actual analysis data
5. Merge the skill-specific CSS into `{{SKILL_SPECIFIC_CSS}}`
6. Merge the content sections into `{{CONTENT_SECTIONS}}`
7. Merge the chart scripts into `{{CHART_SCRIPTS}}`
