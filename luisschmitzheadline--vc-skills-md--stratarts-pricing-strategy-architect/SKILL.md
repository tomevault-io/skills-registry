## STEP 0: Pre-Generation Verification (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: Before generating ANY HTML output, you MUST:**

1. **Read the verification checklist:**
   ```
   Read file: html-templates/VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md
   ```

2. **Read the skeleton template:**
   ```
   Read file: html-templates/pricing-strategy-architect.html
   ```

3. **Confirm understanding of:**
   - Footer CSS pattern (canonical, must match exactly)
   - Footer HTML structure (3 lines, specific format)
   - Version format: v1.0.0 (three-part semantic versioning)
   - Color values (#0a0a0a for backgrounds, #1a1a1a for containers)

**DO NOT PROCEED to Step 1 until these files have been read.**

## STEP 1: Detect Previous Context

**Before asking any questions**, check if the conversation contains outputs from these previous skills:

### Ideal Context (All Present):
- **business-model-designer** output (revenue model, unit economics)
- **customer-persona-builder** output (personas with willingness-to-pay indicators)
- **competitive-intelligence** output (competitor pricing data)
- **value-proposition-crafter** output (value metrics and customer outcomes)

### Partial Context (Some Present):
- Only **business-model-designer** + **customer-persona-builder**
- Only **competitive-intelligence** + **business-model-designer**
- Only basic product/service description with target market

### No Context:
- No previous skill outputs detected

---

## STEP 2: Context-Adaptive Introduction

### If IDEAL CONTEXT detected:
```
I found your previous analyses:

- **Business Model**: [Quote revenue model, unit economics]
- **Customer Personas**: [Quote top persona willingness-to-pay]
- **Competitive Intelligence**: [Quote competitor pricing range]
- **Value Proposition**: [Quote key value metric]

I'll design a comprehensive pricing strategy that captures value, aligns with your personas' willingness-to-pay, and positions competitively.

Ready to begin?
```

### If PARTIAL CONTEXT detected:
```
I found partial context from previous analyses:

[Quote relevant details]

I have some pricing context but need additional information about your costs, value metrics, and customer willingness-to-pay to design optimal pricing.

Ready to proceed?
```

### If NO CONTEXT detected:
```
I'll help you design a comprehensive pricing strategy for your business.

We'll use proven frameworks:
- **Value-Based Pricing**: Price based on customer value, not costs
- **Van Westendorp PSM**: Determine optimal price points
- **Pricing Tiers**: Design package structure (if applicable)
- **Monetization Models**: Choose the right revenue model

First, I need to understand your business, costs, and customer value.

Ready to begin?
```

---

## STEP 3: Foundation Questions (Adapt Based on Context)

### If NO/PARTIAL CONTEXT:

**Question 1: Business Overview**
```
What product or service are you offering?

Be specific about:
- What you're selling
- Target customer (who buys?)
- Core value delivered (what outcome/benefit?)
- Stage (pre-launch, launched, scaling)
- Current pricing (if any) and how it's working
```

**Question 2: Revenue Model**
```
What's your current or intended revenue model?

Common models:
- **Subscription** (monthly/annual recurring)
- **Transaction-based** (% of transaction or per-use)
- **License** (one-time purchase)
- **Freemium** (free tier + paid upgrades)
- **Usage-based** (pay-per-unit consumed)
- **Hybrid** (combination)

Which model are you using or considering?
```

---

## STEP 4: Cost Structure & Economics

**Question CS1: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
```
What does it cost you to deliver your product/service to one customer?

**Variable Costs** (per customer):
- Hosting/infrastructure (e.g., AWS, server costs)
- Third-party services (e.g., API calls, payment processing fees)
- Direct labor (if service business)
- Materials/supplies (if physical product)
- Other variable costs

**Total COGS per customer/unit**: $[amount] (or estimate if pre-launch)

If software with negligible COGS, state "$0 or near-zero."
```

**Question CS2: Fixed Costs**
```
What are your fixed monthly costs?

**Fixed Operating Costs**:
- Team salaries (# of people × avg salary)
- Tools/software subscriptions
- Marketing budget
- Office/overhead
- Other fixed costs

**Total Fixed Costs per Month**: $[amount] (or estimate)
```

**Question CS3: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
```
How much does it cost to acquire one customer?

If you know: $[CAC]

If you don't know yet, estimate based on:
- Marketing budget per month ÷ New customers per month
- Expected cost per lead × Conversion rate

**Target CAC**: $[amount] (or "Unknown, need to determine")
```

**Question CS4: Break-Even & Payback**
```
What are your unit economics targets?

**LTV:CAC Ratio** (Lifetime Value ÷ Customer Acquisition Cost):
- SaaS best practice: 3:1 or higher
- What's your target ratio?

**CAC Payback Period** (months to recover acquisition cost):
- SaaS best practice: < 12 months
- What's your target payback period?

If you don't have targets, state "Need recommendation."
```

---

## STEP 5: Value Metrics & Customer Outcomes

**Question VM1: Value Metric**
```
What metric best represents the value your customer receives?

**Value Metric** = What scales as customer gets more value

Examples:
- **Per user/seat** (e.g., Slack, Zoom)
- **Per transaction** (e.g., Stripe, payment processors)
- **Per GB/unit consumed** (e.g., AWS, Snowflake)
- **Per customer/contact** (e.g., CRM systems)
- **Per project/object** (e.g., Figma files, projects)
- **Flat rate** (unlimited usage)

What's YOUR value metric? (The thing that grows as customer gets more value)
```

**Question VM2: Customer Outcomes**
```
What quantifiable outcomes do customers achieve with your product/service?

**Financial Outcomes** (money saved/earned):
- [e.g., "Reduce operational costs by $X/month"]
- [e.g., "Increase revenue by X%"]
- [e.g., "Avoid $X in penalties/compliance violations"]

**Time Outcomes** (time saved):
- [e.g., "Save 10 hours/week on manual reporting"]
- [e.g., "Reduce project completion time by 30%"]

**Risk Outcomes** (risk reduced):
- [e.g., "Eliminate data loss risk valued at $X"]
- [e.g., "Reduce security breach probability by X%"]

List 3-5 quantifiable outcomes your customers achieve.
```

**Question VM3: Value Realization Timeline**
```
How quickly do customers realize value?

- **Immediate** (value within first session)
- **Days** (value within first week)
- **Weeks** (value within first month)
- **Months** (value takes 3+ months to realize)

Also: What's time-to-value (how long from signup to first outcome)?

This impacts pricing model (faster value = easier to charge upfront).
```

---

## STEP 6: Customer Willingness to Pay

**Question WTP1: Price Sensitivity Research**
```
Have you done any price sensitivity research?

If YES:
- What prices have you tested?
- What were the results (conversion rates, feedback)?
- What price points did customers mention as "too expensive" or "surprisingly cheap"?

If NO:
- Have you had conversations with potential customers about pricing?
- What budget range do they typically have for solutions like yours?
- How much do they currently spend on alternatives?

Share any data or anecdotal feedback you have.
```

**Question WTP2: Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity (If no data)**
```
Let's establish price sensitivity boundaries using Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter.

For your target customers, estimate these four price points:

1. **Too Expensive** (they definitely won't buy): $[X]
2. **Expensive but Worth It** (they hesitate but would buy): $[X]
3. **Great Value** (feels like a bargain): $[X]
4. **Too Cheap** (they'd question quality): $[X]

These are estimates - we'll use them to find optimal price range.
```

**Question WTP3: Persona-Specific Willingness to Pay**
```
If you have multiple customer personas, does willingness-to-pay differ?

For each persona:
- **[Persona 1 Name]**: Budget range $[X-Y], price sensitivity [High/Med/Low]
- **[Persona 2 Name]**: Budget range $[X-Y], price sensitivity [High/Med/Low]
- **[Persona 3 Name]**: Budget range $[X-Y], price sensitivity [High/Med/Low]

If you don't have personas, skip this question.
```

---

## STEP 7: Competitive Pricing Landscape

**Question CP1: Competitor Pricing**
```
What are your competitors charging?

For each top competitor:
- **[Competitor 1 Name]**: $[X/mo or X per unit] - [Pricing model: sub, transaction, etc.]
- **[Competitor 2 Name]**: $[X/mo or X per unit] - [Model]
- **[Competitor 3 Name]**: $[X/mo or X per unit] - [Model]

Also note:
- Do they offer free trials/freemium?
- How many tiers do they have?
- What's included in each tier?

If you already have competitive-intelligence output, I'll extract this data.
```

**Question CP2: Competitive Positioning**
```
How do you want to position on price relative to competitors?

- **Premium** (20-50% higher than competitors)
  - Justification: [Superior quality, exclusive features, better service]

- **Market Rate** (within 10% of competitors)
  - Justification: [Competitive feature parity, standard positioning]

- **Value/Discount** (20-40% cheaper than competitors)
  - Justification: [Efficiency, simplification, targeting underserved segment]

- **Disruptive** (50%+ cheaper or different model entirely)
  - Justification: [New technology, removing middlemen, targeting new segment]

Which positioning makes sense given your differentiation and target market?
```

---

## STEP 8: Pricing Model Selection

**Question PM1: Pricing Model Evaluation**
```
Let's evaluate which pricing model best fits your business.

For each model, rate 1-10 (1=poor fit, 10=perfect fit):

**Subscription (monthly/annual recurring)**:
- Fit: [X/10]
- Pros: [Predictable revenue, ongoing relationship]
- Cons: [Need to prove ongoing value]

**Usage-Based (pay per unit consumed)**:
- Fit: [X/10]
- Pros: [Aligns with value, easier adoption]
- Cons: [Unpredictable revenue, complex billing]

**Tiered (multiple packages)**:
- Fit: [X/10]
- Pros: [Capture different segments, upsell path]
- Cons: [Complexity, feature packaging decisions]

**Freemium (free tier + paid)**:
- Fit: [X/10]
- Pros: [Viral adoption, low barrier]
- Cons: [Monetization challenge, support costs]

**Transaction-Based (% of transaction)**:
- Fit: [X/10]
- Pros: [Aligns with customer success]
- Cons: [Only works for transaction-enabling products]

Which model(s) do you prefer?
```

**Question PM2: Tiering Strategy (If Applicable)**
```
If using tiered pricing, how many tiers should you have?

Best practices:
- **2 tiers** (Simple, but limited upsell)
- **3 tiers** (Most common - Good/Better/Best)
- **4+ tiers** (Complex, but captures more segments)

Also consider:
- Will you offer a free tier? (Freemium)
- Will you offer a custom/enterprise tier? (Negotiated pricing)

Recommended tier structure: [# of tiers]
```

---

## STEP 9: Packaging Strategy (If Tiered)

**Question PKG1: Feature Packaging**
```
If you're using tiers, what features go in each tier?

List your key features/capabilities, then assign to tiers:

**Tier 1** (Entry-level): [Name it: Starter, Basic, Free, etc.]
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]
- Target: [Which customer segment?]

**Tier 2** (Mid-market): [Name it: Professional, Growth, Plus, etc.]
- [All Tier 1 features +]
- [Feature 4]
- [Feature 5]
- [Feature 6]
- Target: [Which segment?]

**Tier 3** (High-end): [Name it: Business, Premium, Enterprise, etc.]
- [All Tier 2 features +]
- [Feature 7]
- [Feature 8]
- Target: [Which segment?]

[Optional **Tier 4**: Custom/Enterprise]
- [All features + custom/white-glove service]

Provide your feature breakdown by tier.
```

**Question PKG2: Good-Better-Best Psychology**
```
If using 3 tiers, which tier do you want most customers to choose?

**Best Practice**: Design the middle tier as the "obvious choice"

- **Tier 1** (anchor low price, but limited - only 10-15% choose)
- **Tier 2** (sweet spot - target 60-70% of customers) ← Most profitable
- **Tier 3** (premium option - 15-20% choose) ← Highest revenue per customer

Which tier is your "sweet spot" that you want to drive most customers to?
```

---

## STEP 10: Pricing Experiments & Testing

**Question PE1: Launch Pricing vs. Long-Term**
```
Are you launching with introductory pricing or long-term pricing?

**Introductory Pricing** (discounts to gain traction):
- Pros: Easier to acquire early customers, build case studies
- Cons: Hard to raise prices later, trains customers to expect discounts

**Long-Term Pricing** (your target pricing from day 1):
- Pros: No need to raise prices, attracts right customers
- Cons: Harder initial traction, requires strong positioning

**Recommendation**: [Which approach fits your stage?]
```

**Question PE2: Pricing Experiments to Run**
```
What pricing experiments should you run?

Common experiments:
- **A/B test pricing** (show different prices to different segments)
- **Test tier names** (does "Pro" convert better than "Growth"?)
- **Test annual vs monthly** (discount annual to improve cash flow)
- **Test value metric** (per user vs per team vs flat rate)
- **Test free trial length** (7 days vs 14 days vs 30 days)

Which experiments make sense for your business?
```

## 2. Cost Structure & Unit Economics

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

**Variable Costs per Customer**:
| Cost Component | Amount | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Hosting/Infrastructure | $[X] | [e.g., AWS: $5/customer/month] |
| Third-Party Services | $[X] | [e.g., API calls, payment fees] |
| Direct Labor | $[X] | [If applicable] |
| Other Variable Costs | $[X] | [Specify] |
| **Total COGS per Customer** | **$[X]** | |

**Gross Margin Calculation**:
```
Gross Margin = (Price - COGS) ÷ Price × 100%
Example: ($100 - $10) ÷ $100 = 90% gross margin
```

**Target Gross Margin**: [X%]

### Fixed Operating Costs

**Monthly Fixed Costs**:
| Cost Category | Amount | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Team Salaries | $[X] | [# people × avg salary] |
| Tools/Software | $[X] | [List key subscriptions] |
| Marketing | $[X] | [Monthly marketing budget] |
| Office/Overhead | $[X] | [If applicable] |
| **Total Fixed Costs** | **$[X]** | |

**Break-Even Analysis**:
```
Break-Even Customers = Fixed Costs ÷ (Price - COGS)
Example: $50,000 ÷ ($100 - $10) = 556 customers to break even
```

**Your Break-Even**: [X customers] at $[price]

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Current/Target CAC**: $[X]

**CAC Calculation**:
```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Costs ÷ New Customers Acquired
Example: $30,000 marketing spend ÷ 100 new customers = $300 CAC
```

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**LTV Calculation**:
```
LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin % × Avg Customer Lifetime (months)
Example: $100/mo × 90% × 36 months = $3,240 LTV
```

**Your LTV**: $[X]

### Unit Economics Summary

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| ARPU | $[X] | $[X] | [On Track / Behind / Ahead] |
| COGS per Customer | $[X] | $[X] | [Status] |
| Gross Margin | [X%] | [X%] | [Status] |
| CAC | $[X] | $[X] | [Status] |
| LTV | $[X] | $[X] | [Status] |
| LTV:CAC Ratio | [X:1] | [X:1] | [Status] |
| CAC Payback Period | [X mo] | [X mo] | [Status] |

**Health Check**: [Healthy / Needs Improvement / Critical]

## 8. Packaging Strategy

### Feature Packaging Philosophy

**How We Decide What Goes in Each Tier**:

1. **Tier 1 (Entry)**: Core features that deliver basic value
   - Must be valuable enough to convert free users
   - But limited enough to encourage upgrade

2. **Tier 2 (Sweet Spot)**: Features that most customers need
   - Complete solution for target market
   - 80% of value, 50% of price of Tier 3

3. **Tier 3 (Premium)**: Advanced features for power users
   - Enterprise-grade security, compliance
   - Scalability and support

4. **Tier 4 (Enterprise)**: Custom/white-glove service
   - Negotiated pricing
   - High-touch support

### Feature Assignment Matrix

| Feature | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Enterprise | Rationale |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|------------|-----------|
| [Core Feature 1] | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | [Must-have for all] |
| [Core Feature 2] | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | [Core value] |
| [Advanced Feature 1] | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | [Upsell driver] |
| [Advanced Feature 2] | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | [Needed by most] |
| [Power Feature 1] | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | [Only power users need] |
| [Enterprise Feature 1] | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | [Enterprise-only: SSO] |

### Packaging Best Practices Applied

1. **Value Metric Alignment**: [How tiers align with value metric]
2. **Good-Better-Best Psychology**: [How Tier 2 is positioned as obvious choice]
3. **Upgrade Path**: [Clear path from Tier 1 → 2 → 3]
4. **Feature Anchoring**: [Tier 3 makes Tier 2 look reasonable]

---

## 9. Pricing Psychology & Optimization

### Psychological Pricing Tactics

**Charm Pricing** (ending in 9 or 7):
- Example: $99/mo instead of $100/mo
- **Use?**: [Yes/No - rationale]

**Anchoring** (show higher price first):
- Example: Display Enterprise price ($500/mo) before Starter ($49/mo)
- **Use?**: [Yes/No - rationale]

**Decoy Pricing** (make middle tier look best):
- Example: Tier 1 ($49), Tier 2 ($99), Tier 3 ($149) - Tier 2 offers 3x value for 2x price
- **Use?**: [Yes/No - rationale]

**Annual Discounts** (incentivize longer commitments):
- Recommended: [15-25%] discount for annual vs monthly
- Your discount: [X%]
- Rationale: [Improves cash flow, reduces churn]

### Pricing Page Optimization

**Layout Recommendations**:
1. **Tier 2 as Default**: Highlight middle tier with "Most Popular" badge
2. **Comparison Table**: Show feature comparison across tiers
3. **Social Proof**: Include customer logos, testimonials
4. **Clear CTA**: "Start Free Trial" vs "Get Started" vs "Contact Sales"

**A/B Testing Opportunities**:
1. Test tier names ([Starter/Pro/Business] vs [Basic/Premium/Enterprise])
2. Test CTA copy ("Start Free Trial" vs "Try 14 Days Free")
3. Test annual toggle (default to annual with discount vs default to monthly)
4. Test pricing page layout (horizontal tiers vs vertical comparison)

## 10. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Launch (Months 1-3)

**Pricing Structure**:
- [Launch with X tiers at $Y, $Z pricing]
- [Include/exclude free tier]
- [Free trial: X days]

**Rationale**: [Why this structure for launch]

**Key Decisions**:
- [ ] Finalize tier names and descriptions
- [ ] Set up billing infrastructure (Stripe, Chargebee, etc.)
- [ ] Create pricing page with comparison table
- [ ] Set up free trial workflow
- [ ] Train sales team (if applicable) on pricing and objection handling

**Success Metrics**:
- Target: [X] paying customers by end of Month 3
- Target ARPU: $[X]
- Target conversion rate (trial → paid): [X%]

---

### Phase 2: Optimization (Months 4-9)

**Experiments to Run**:
1. **A/B test pricing** (test +/- 20% on Tier 2)
2. **Test annual discount** (test 15% vs 25% vs 20%)
3. **Test tier distribution** (adjust limits to drive more to Tier 2)
4. **Test free trial length** (7 days vs 14 days vs 30 days)

**Monitoring**:
- Weekly: Conversion rates by tier
- Monthly: ARPU, LTV, CAC payback
- Quarterly: Customer feedback on pricing

**Potential Adjustments**:
- Raise/lower prices based on data
- Add/remove features from tiers
- Introduce new tier (e.g., team tier between Starter and Pro)

---

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 10-18)

**Mature Pricing Strategy**:
- [Finalize pricing based on 9 months of data]
- [Introduce Enterprise tier with custom pricing (if not already)]

**Advanced Tactics**:
- **Volume Discounts**: Offer discounts for larger deployments
- **Multi-Year Contracts**: Discount for 2-year or 3-year commitments
- **Partner Pricing**: Special pricing for integration partners or resellers
- **Non-Profit/Education Pricing**: Discounted pricing for specific segments

**Key Decisions**:
- [ ] Review pricing annually (increase prices for new customers)
- [ ] Grandfather existing customers or apply price increases
- [ ] Introduce premium add-ons (e.g., advanced analytics, custom integrations)

## STEP 12: Quality Review & Iteration

After generating the pricing strategy, present it and ask:

```
I've created your Pricing Strategy with [X] tiers at $[Y-Z] pricing.

**Quality Check**:
- Does the pricing align with your value and costs?
- Is the tier structure clear and compelling?
- Are unit economics (LTV:CAC, payback) realistic?
- Any concerns about pricing relative to competitors?

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust pricing levels (which tier and why?)
2. Refine tier packaging (add/remove features)
3. Change pricing model entirely
4. Finalize this version

(I can do up to 2 revision passes if needed)
```

---

## STEP 13: Save & Next Steps

After final approval:

```
Perfect! Your Pricing Strategy is ready.

**Save Options**:
1. Save as: `pricing-strategy-[business-name].md`
2. Custom filename
3. Just keep in conversation (I'll remember for downstream skills)

**Next Recommended Skills**:
- **product-positioning-expert**: Craft messaging that justifies your pricing and differentiates from competitors
- **go-to-market-planner**: Build GTM strategy with pricing as core component
- **sales-playbook-builder**: Equip sales team to handle pricing objections
- **feature-prioritization-framework**: Prioritize features to justify tier differentiation

Which filename would you like (or enter custom)?
```

## Critical Guidelines

**1. Price Based on Value, Not Costs**
Costs set a floor, but value sets the ceiling. If you deliver $50K/year value, don't price at $5K just because COGS is $500.

**2. Design for the Customer You Want**
Tier 2 should be the sweet spot for your ideal customer. Don't optimize for tire-kickers in Tier 1.

**3. Make Tier 2 Obvious**
Use Good-Better-Best psychology. Tier 1 should feel limited, Tier 3 should feel excessive, Tier 2 should feel "just right."

**4. Test, Don't Guess**
Run pricing experiments. Data beats intuition. Test price points, tier names, annual discounts.

**5. Focus on Unit Economics**
LTV:CAC ratio >3:1 and payback <12 months are healthy. If not hitting these, pricing is too low or CAC too high.

**6. Annual > Monthly**
Incentivize annual with 15-25% discount. Improves cash flow and reduces churn.

**7. Raise Prices Regularly**
Inflation + increasing value = higher prices. Raise prices annually for new customers. Grandfather or granular existing customers.

**8. Positioning Matters**
Premium pricing requires premium positioning. Value pricing requires efficiency story. Match pricing to positioning.
