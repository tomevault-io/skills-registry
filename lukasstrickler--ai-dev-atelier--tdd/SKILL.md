# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Strict Red-Green-Refactor workflow for robust, self-documenting, production-ready code.

## Quick Navigation

| Situation | Go To |
|-----------|-------|
| New to this codebase | [Step 1: Explore Environment](#step-1-explore-test-environment) |
| Know the framework, starting work | [Step 2: Select Mode](#step-2-select-mode) |
| Need the core loop reference | [Step 3: Core TDD Loop](#step-3-the-core-tdd-loop) |
| Complex edge cases to cover | [Property-Based Testing](#property-based-testing) |
| Tests are flaky/unreliable | [Flaky Test Management](#flaky-test-management) |
| Need isolated test environment | [Hermetic Testing](#hermetic-testing) |
| Measuring test quality | [Mutation Testing](#mutation-testing) |

## The Three Rules (Robert C. Martin)

1. **No Production Code** without a failing test
2. **Write Only Enough Test to Fail** (compilation errors count)
3. **Write Only Enough Code to Pass** (no optimizations yet)

**The Loop:** 🔴 RED (write failing test) → 🟢 GREEN (minimal code to pass) → 🔵 REFACTOR (clean up) → Repeat

---

## Step 1: Explore Test Environment

**Do NOT assume anything.** Explore the codebase first.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Search for test files: `glob("**/*.test.*")`, `glob("**/*.spec.*")`, `glob("**/test_*.py")`
- [ ] Check `package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, or CI workflows
- [ ] Look for config: `vitest.config.*`, `jest.config.*`, `pytest.ini`, `Cargo.toml`

**Framework Detection:**

| Language | Config Files | Test Command |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Node.js | `package.json`, `vitest.config.*` | `npm test`, `bun test` |
| Python | `pyproject.toml`, `pytest.ini` | `pytest` |
| Go | `go.mod`, `*_test.go` | `go test ./...` |
| Rust | `Cargo.toml` | `cargo test` |

---

## Step 2: Select Mode

| Mode | When | First Action |
|------|------|--------------|
| **New Feature** | Adding functionality | Read existing module tests, confirm green baseline |
| **Bug Fix** | Reproducing issue | Write failing reproduction test FIRST |
| **Refactor** | Cleaning code | Ensure ≥80% coverage on target code |
| **Legacy** | No tests exist | Add characterization tests before changing |

**Tie-breaker:** If coverage <20% or tests absent → use **Legacy Mode** first.

### Mode: New Feature
1. Read existing tests for the module
2. Run tests to confirm green baseline
3. Enter Core Loop for new behavior
4. **Commits:** `test(module): add test for X` → `feat(module): implement X`

### Mode: Bug Fix
1. Write failing reproduction test (MUST fail before fix)
2. Confirm failure is assertion error, not syntax error
3. Write minimal fix
4. Run full test suite
5. **Commits:** `test: add failing test for bug #123` → `fix: description (#123)`

### Mode: Refactor
1. Run coverage on the specific function you'll refactor
2. If coverage <80% → add characterization tests first
3. Refactor in small steps (ONE change → run tests → repeat)
4. Never change behavior during refactor

### Mode: Legacy Code
1. **Find Seams** - insertion points for tests (Sensing Seams, Separation Seams)
2. **Break Dependencies** - use Sprout Method or Wrap Method
3. Add characterization tests (capture current behavior)
4. Build safety net: happy path + error cases + boundaries
5. Then apply TDD for your changes

→ See `references/examples.md` for full code examples of each mode.

---

## Step 3: The Core TDD Loop

### Before Starting: Scenario List
List all behaviors to cover:
- [ ] Happy path cases
- [ ] Edge cases and boundaries
- [ ] Error/failure cases
- [ ] **Pessimism:** 3 ways this could fail (network, null, invalid state)

### 🔴 RED Phase
1. Write ONE test (single behavior or edge case)
2. Use AAA: Arrange → Act → Assert
3. Run test, **verify it FAILS for expected reason**

**Checks:**
- Is failure an assertion error? (Not `SyntaxError`/`ModuleNotFoundError`)
- Can I explain why this should fail?
- If test passes immediately → STOP. Test is broken or feature exists.

### 🟢 GREEN Phase
1. Write minimal code to pass
2. Do NOT implement "perfect" solution
3. **Verify test passes**

**Checks:**
- Is this the simplest solution?
- Can I delete any of this code and still pass?

### 🔵 REFACTOR Phase
1. Look for duplication, unclear names, magic values
2. Clean up **without changing behavior**
3. **Verify tests still pass**

### Repeat
Select next scenario, return to RED.

**Triangulation:** If implementation is too specific (hardcoded), write another test with different inputs to force generalization.

---

## Stop Conditions

| Signal | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Test passes immediately | Check assertions, verify feature isn't already built |
| Test fails for wrong reason | Fix setup/imports first |
| Flaky test | **STOP.** Fix non-determinism immediately |
| Slow feedback (>5s) | Optimize or mock external calls |
| Coverage decreased | Add tests for uncovered paths |

---

## Test Distribution: The Testing Trophy

The Testing Trophy (Kent C. Dodds) reflects modern testing reality: **integration tests give the best confidence-to-effort ratio**.

```
          _____________
         /   System    \      ← Few, slow, high confidence; brittle (E2E)
        /_______________\
       /                 \
      /    Integration    \   ← Real interactions between units — **BEST ROI** (Integration)
      \                   /
       \_________________/
         \    Unit     /      ← Fast & cheap but test in isolation (Unit) 
          \___________/
          /   Static  \       ← Typecheck, linting — typos/types (Static)
         /_____________\
```

### Layer Breakdown

| Layer | What | Tools | When |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| **Static** | Type errors, syntax, linting | TypeScript, ESLint | Always on, catches 50%+ of bugs for free |
| **Unit** | Pure functions, algorithms, utilities | vitest, jest, pytest | Isolated logic with no dependencies |
| **Integration** | **Components + hooks + services together** | Testing Library, MSW, Testcontainers | Real user flows, real(ish) data |
| **E2E** | Full app in browser | Playwright, Cypress | Critical paths only (login, checkout) |

### Why Integration Tests Win

**Unit tests** prove code works in isolation. **Integration tests** prove code works together.

| Concern | Unit Test | Integration Test |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Component renders | ✅ | ✅ |
| Component + hook works | ❌ | ✅ |
| Component + API works | ❌ | ✅ |
| User flow works | ❌ | ✅ |
| Catches real bugs | Sometimes | Usually |

**The insight**: Most bugs live in the **seams** between modules, not inside pure functions. Integration tests catch seam bugs; unit tests don't.

### Practical Guidance

1. **Start with integration tests** - Test the way users use your code
2. **Drop to unit tests** for complex algorithms or edge cases
3. **Use E2E sparingly** - Slow, flaky, expensive to maintain
4. **Let static analysis do the heavy lifting** - TypeScript catches more bugs than most unit tests
5. **Prefer fakes over mocks** - Fakes have real behavior; mocks just return canned data
6. **SMURF quality**: Sustainable, Maintainable, Useful, Resilient, Fast

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Mirror Blindness** | Same agent writes test AND code | State test intent before GREEN |
| **Happy Path Bias** | Only success scenarios | Include errors in Scenario List |
| **Refactoring While Red** | Changing structure with failing tests | Get to GREEN first |
| **The Mockery** | Over-mocking hides bugs | Prefer fakes or real implementations |
| **Coverage Theater** | Tests without meaningful assertions | Assert behavior, not lines |
| **Multi-Test Step** | Multiple tests before implementing | One test at a time |
| **Verification Trap** 🤖 | AI tests *what code does* not *what it should do* | State intent in plain language; separate agent review |
| **Test Exploitation** 🤖 | LLMs exploit weak assertions or overload operators | Use PBT alongside examples; strict equality |
| **Assertion Omission** 🤖 | Missing edge cases (null, undefined, boundaries) | Scenario list with errors; `test.each` |
| **Hallucinated Mock** 🤖 | AI generates fake mocks without proper setup | Testcontainers for integration; real Fakes for unit |

**Critical**: Verify tests by (1) running them, (2) having separate agent review, (3) never trusting generated tests blindly.

## Advanced Techniques

Use these techniques at specific points in your workflow:

| Technique | Use During | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Test Doubles | 🔴 RED phase | Isolate dependencies when writing tests |
| Property-Based Testing | 🔴 RED phase | Cover edge cases for complex logic |
| Contract Testing | 🔴 RED phase | Define API expectations between services |
| Snapshot Testing | 🔴 RED phase | Capture UI/response structure |
| Hermetic Testing | 🔵 Setup | Ensure test isolation and determinism |
| Mutation Testing | ✅ After GREEN | Validate test suite effectiveness |
| Coverage Analysis | ✅ After GREEN | Find untested code paths |
| Flaky Test Management | 🔧 Maintenance | Fix unreliable tests blocking CI |

---

### Test Doubles (Use: Writing Tests with Dependencies)

**When:** Your code depends on something slow, unreliable, or complex (DB, API, filesystem).

| Type | Purpose | When |
|------|---------|------|
| **Stub** | Returns canned answers | Need specific return values |
| **Mock** | Verifies interactions | Need to verify calls made |
| **Fake** | Simplified implementation | Need real behavior without cost |
| **Spy** | Records calls | Need to observe without changing |

**Decision:** Dependency slow/unreliable? → Fake (complex) or Stub (simple). Need to verify calls? → Mock/Spy. Otherwise → real implementation.

→ See `references/examples.md` → [Test Double Examples](#test-double-examples)

---

### Hermetic Testing (Use: Test Environment Setup)

**When:** Setting up test infrastructure. Tests must be isolated and deterministic.

**Principles:**
- **Isolation**: Unique temp directories/state per test
- **Reset**: Clean up in setUp/tearDown
- **Determinism**: No time-based logic or shared mutable state

**Database Strategies:**

| Strategy | Speed | Fidelity | Use When |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| In-memory (SQLite) | Fast | Low | Unit tests, simple queries |
| Testcontainers | Medium | High | Integration tests |
| Transactional Rollback | Fast | High | Tests sharing schema (80x faster than TRUNCATE) |

→ See `references/examples.md` → [Hermetic Testing Examples](#hermetic-testing-examples)

---

### Property-Based Testing (Use: Writing Tests for Complex Logic)

**When:** Writing tests for algorithms, state machines, serialization, or code with many edge cases.

**Tools:** fast-check (JS/TS), Hypothesis (Python), proptest (Rust)

**Properties to Test:**
- Commutativity: `f(a, b) == f(b, a)`
- Associativity: `f(f(a, b), c) == f(a, f(b, c))`
- Identity: `f(a, identity) == a`
- Round-trip: `decode(encode(x)) == x`
- Metamorphic: If input changes by X, output changes by Y (useful when you don't know expected output)

**How:** Replace multiple example-based tests with one property test that generates random inputs.

**Critical:** Always log the **seed** on failure. Without it, you cannot reproduce the failing case.

→ See `references/examples.md` → [Property-Based Testing Examples](#property-based-testing-examples)

---

### Mutation Testing (Use: Validating Test Quality)

**When:** After tests pass, to verify they actually catch bugs. Use for critical code (auth, payments) or before major refactors.

**Tools:** Stryker (JS/TS), PIT (Java), mutmut (Python)

**How:** Tool mutates your code (e.g., changes `>` to `>=`). If tests still pass → your tests are weak.

**Interpretation:**
- **>80% mutation score** = good test suite
- **Survived mutants** = tests don't catch those changes → add tests for these

**Equivalent Mutant Problem:** Some mutants change syntax but not behavior (e.g., `i < 10` → `i != 10` in a loop where i only increments). These can't be killed—100% score is often impossible. Focus on surviving mutants in *critical paths*, not chasing perfect scores.

**When NOT to use:** Tool-generated code (OpenAPI clients, Protobuf stubs, ORM models), simple DTOs/getters, legacy code with slow tests, or CI pipelines that must finish in <5 minutes. Use `--incremental --since main` for PR-focused runs. Note: This does NOT mean skip mutation testing on code you (the agent) wrote—always validate your own work.

→ See `references/examples.md` → [Mutation Testing Examples](#mutation-testing-examples)

---

### Flaky Test Management (Use: CI/CD Maintenance)

**When:** Tests fail intermittently, blocking CI or eroding trust in the test suite.

**Root Causes:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Timing (`setTimeout`, races) | Fake timers, await properly |
| Shared state | Isolate per test |
| Randomness | Seed or mock |
| Network | Use MSW or fakes |
| Order dependency | Make tests independent |
| Parallel transaction conflicts | Isolate DB connections per worker |

**How:** Detect (`--repeat 10`) → Quarantine (separate suite) → Fix root cause → Restore

**Quarantine Rules:**
- **Issue-linked**: Every quarantined test MUST link to a tracking issue. Prevents "quarantine-and-forget."
- **Mute, don't skip**: Prefer muting (runs but doesn't fail build) over skipping. You still collect failure data.
- **Reintroduction criteria**: Test must pass N consecutive runs (e.g., 100) on main before leaving quarantine.

→ See `references/examples.md` → [Flaky Test Examples](#flaky-test-examples)

---

### Contract Testing (Use: Writing Tests for Service Boundaries)

**When:** Writing tests for code that calls or exposes APIs. Prevents integration breakage.

**How (Pact):** Consumer defines expected interactions → Contract published → Provider verifies → CI fails if contract broken.

→ See `references/examples.md` → [Contract Testing Examples](#contract-testing-examples)

---

### Coverage Analysis (Use: Finding Gaps After Tests Pass)

**When:** After writing tests, to find untested code paths. NOT a goal in itself.

| Metric | Measures | Threshold |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Line | Lines executed | 70-80% |
| Branch | Decision paths | 60-70% |
| Mutation | Test effectiveness | >80% |

**Risk-Based Prioritization:** P0 (auth, payments) → P1 (core logic) → P2 (helpers) → P3 (config)

**Warning:** High coverage ≠ good tests. Tests must assert meaningful behavior.

---

### Snapshot Testing (Use: Writing Tests for UI/Output Structure)

**When:** Writing tests for UI components, API responses, or error message formats.

**Appropriate:** UI structure, API response shapes, error formats.
**Avoid:** Behavior testing, dynamic content, entire pages.

**How:** Capture output once, verify it doesn't change unexpectedly. Always review diffs carefully.

→ See `references/examples.md` → [Snapshot Testing Examples](#snapshot-testing-examples)

## Integration with Other Skills

| Task | Skill | Usage |
|------|-------|-------|
| Committing | `git-commit` | `test:` for RED, `feat:` for GREEN |
| Code Quality | `code-quality` | Run during REFACTOR phase |
| Documentation | `docs-check` | Check if behavior changes need docs |
