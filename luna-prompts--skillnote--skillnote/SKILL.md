# SkillNote Doctor

Diagnose your SkillNote + OpenClaw integration in 6 checks. Run every check even if an earlier one fails — the user needs the full picture. Report ✓ pass or ✗ fail with specific remediation for each.

## Check 1 — clawhub binary

Run: `which clawhub`

- ✓ Pass: binary found
- ✗ Fail: `clawhub not found. Install from https://clawhub.ai or run: npm install -g clawhub`

## Check 2 — SkillNote config

Read `~/.openclaw/skills/skillnote/config.json`.

- ✓ Pass: file exists, valid JSON, `host` is non-empty
- ✗ Fail (missing): `Config not found. SkillNote is not installed. Install with: clawhub install skillnote && clawhub install skillnote-resolver`
- ✗ Fail (invalid JSON): `Config is malformed. Delete ~/.openclaw/skills/skillnote/config.json and re-run skillnote setup.`
- ✗ Fail (empty host): `Config exists but host is empty. Ask your agent to re-setup skillnote.`

## Check 3 — Registry reachability

GET `<host>/v1/skills?limit=1`

- ✓ Pass: HTTP 200
- ✗ Fail (timeout/refused): `SkillNote at <host> is unreachable. Verify the URL and that your instance is running. Self-host guide: https://github.com/luna-prompts/skillnote`
- ✗ Fail (non-200): `Unexpected HTTP <N>. Check SkillNote server logs.`

## Check 4 — AGENTS.md marker

Read `~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md`. Check for exact string `<skillnote v1>`.

- ✓ Pass: marker found
- ✗ Fail: `AGENTS.md marker missing. Ask your agent: "re-graft skillnote into AGENTS.md" — or reinstall: clawhub install skillnote`

## Check 5 — skillnote-resolver installed

Check `~/.openclaw/skills/skillnote-resolver/SKILL.md` exists.

- ✓ Pass: file found
- ✗ Fail: `skillnote-resolver not found. Install with: clawhub install skillnote-resolver`

## Check 6 — resolver endpoint

POST `<host>/v1/openclaw/context-bundle` with body `{"task_summary": "doctor health check", "max_skills": 1}`

- ✓ Pass: HTTP 200, `skills` array present
- ✗ Fail: `Context bundle endpoint unavailable. Check SkillNote server version — endpoint requires v0.3.0+`

---

## Summary

After all checks report:

```
SkillNote health: X/6 checks passed
```

If all 6 pass:
> Your SkillNote integration looks healthy. If you're still seeing issues, check https://github.com/luna-prompts/skillnote/issues

If Check 2 fails with "Config not found" (SkillNote not installed at all):
> SkillNote not detected. Install with:
> ```
> clawhub install skillnote
> clawhub install skillnote-resolver
> ```
> Then follow the 5-step setup that runs automatically on first load.

# Hard rules

- Never modify any file during diagnosis — read-only.
- Never POST to any endpoint other than `/v1/openclaw/context-bundle`.
- Run all 6 checks regardless of earlier failures.
- Never guess or invent the host URL — read it strictly from config.json.
