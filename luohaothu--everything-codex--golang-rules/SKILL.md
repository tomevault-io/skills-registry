# Go Coding Rules

## Coding Style

### Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate existing ones:

```
// Pseudocode
WRONG:  modify(original, field, value) -> changes original in-place
CORRECT: update(original, field, value) -> returns new copy with change
```

Rationale: Immutable data prevents hidden side effects, makes debugging easier, and enables safe concurrency.

### File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:
- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large modules
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

### Formatting

- **gofmt** and **goimports** are mandatory -- no style debates

### Design Principles

- Accept interfaces, return structs
- Keep interfaces small (1-3 methods)

### Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:
- Handle errors explicitly at every level
- Provide user-friendly error messages in UI-facing code
- Log detailed error context on the server side
- Never silently swallow errors

Always wrap errors with context:

```go
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to create user: %w", err)
}
```

### Input Validation

ALWAYS validate at system boundaries:
- Validate all user input before processing
- Use schema-based validation where available
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Never trust external data (API responses, user input, file content)

### Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:
- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants or config)
- [ ] No mutation (immutable patterns used)

## Patterns

### Skeleton Projects

When implementing new functionality:
1. Search for battle-tested skeleton projects
2. Evaluate options for security, extensibility, relevance
3. Clone best match as foundation
4. Iterate within proven structure

### Repository Pattern

Encapsulate data access behind a consistent interface:
- Define standard operations: findAll, findById, create, update, delete
- Concrete implementations handle storage details (database, API, file, etc.)
- Business logic depends on the abstract interface, not the storage mechanism
- Enables easy swapping of data sources and simplifies testing with mocks

### API Response Format

Use a consistent envelope for all API responses:
- Include a success/status indicator
- Include the data payload (nullable on error)
- Include an error message field (nullable on success)
- Include metadata for paginated responses (total, page, limit)

### Functional Options

```go
type Option func(*Server)

func WithPort(port int) Option {
    return func(s *Server) { s.port = port }
}

func NewServer(opts ...Option) *Server {
    s := &Server{port: 8080}
    for _, opt := range opts {
        opt(s)
    }
    return s
}
```

### Small Interfaces

Define interfaces where they are used, not where they are implemented.

### Dependency Injection

Use constructor functions to inject dependencies:

```go
func NewUserService(repo UserRepository, logger Logger) *UserService {
    return &UserService{repo: repo, logger: logger}
}
```

## Testing

### Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows

### Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:
1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

### Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Check test isolation
2. Verify mocks are correct
3. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)

### Framework

Use the standard `go test` with **table-driven tests**.

### Race Detection

Always run with the `-race` flag:

```bash
go test -race ./...
```

### Coverage

```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

## Security

### Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

### Secret Management

- NEVER hardcode secrets in source code
- ALWAYS use environment variables or a secret manager
- Validate that required secrets are present at startup
- Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed

```go
apiKey := os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if apiKey == "" {
    log.Fatal("OPENAI_API_KEY not configured")
}
```

### Security Scanning

- Use **gosec** for static security analysis:
  ```bash
  gosec ./...
  ```

### Context & Timeouts

Always use `context.Context` for timeout control:

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 5*time.Second)
defer cancel()
```

### Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:
1. STOP immediately
2. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
3. Rotate any exposed secrets
4. Review entire codebase for similar issues
