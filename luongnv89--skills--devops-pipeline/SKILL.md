Use when asked to "setup CI/CD", "add pre-commit hooks", "create GitHub Actions", "setup quality gates", "automate testing", "add linting to CI", "reduce GitHub Actions dependency", "run tests locally before push", "shift-left testing", "end-to-end pre-commit", or any DevOps automation for code quality. Detects project type and configures appropriate tools. Prioritizes running as many tests as possible locally in pre-commit to reduce CI cost and catch issues before they reach GitHub. Use when this capability is needed.

# DevOps Pipeline

Implement comprehensive DevOps quality gates adapted to project type, with a **shift-left philosophy**: run as many checks as possible locally via pre-commit so developers get fast feedback and CI is a safety net rather than the primary gate.

**Core principle**: If a check can run locally in under ~60 seconds, it belongs in pre-commit. GitHub Actions should handle things that can't run locally: matrix version testing, secrets-based security scans, deployment, and reporting.

## Repo Sync Before Edits (mandatory)
Before creating/updating/deleting files in an existing repository, sync the current branch with remote:

```bash
branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
git fetch origin
git pull --rebase origin "$branch"
```

If the working tree is not clean, stash first, sync, then restore:

```bash
git stash push -u -m "pre-sync"
branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
git fetch origin && git pull --rebase origin "$branch"
git stash pop
```

If `origin` is missing, pull is unavailable, or rebase/stash conflicts occur, stop and ask the user before continuing.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Project

Detect project characteristics:

```bash
# Check for package files and configs
ls -la package.json pyproject.toml Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml build.gradle *.csproj 2>/dev/null
ls -la .eslintrc* .prettierrc* tsconfig.json mypy.ini setup.cfg ruff.toml 2>/dev/null
ls -la .pre-commit-config.yaml .github/workflows/*.yml 2>/dev/null
```

Identify:
- **Languages**: JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, etc.
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Django, FastAPI, etc.
- **Build system**: npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, poetry, cargo, go, maven, gradle
- **Existing tooling**: Linters, formatters, type checkers already configured
- **Is this a CLI tool?** — if yes, enumerate all commands/subcommands (check README, `--help`, `click`/`argparse`/`cobra` source) to build an E2E test suite

### 2. Configure Pre-commit Hooks (maximize local coverage)

Install pre-commit framework:

```bash
pip install pre-commit  # or brew install pre-commit
```

Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` based on detected stack. See [references/precommit-configs.md](references/precommit-configs.md) for language-specific configurations.

**What to put in pre-commit (run on every commit):**
- Format checks (Prettier, Black/Ruff, gofmt, rustfmt)
- Lint (ESLint, Ruff, golangci-lint, Clippy)
- Type checks (tsc, mypy)
- Security scans that work offline (Bandit, cargo-audit, gosec, `detect-secrets`)
- Unit tests (fast, <10s) — always on `commit` stage
- Build/compile verification (catches import errors, compile failures early)

**What to put in pre-commit on `push` stage (run on git push):**
- Full test suite (unit + integration)
- **End-to-end tests for every CLI command** (see below)
- Coverage checks
- Slower linters (full golangci-lint ruleset)

**What stays in GitHub Actions only:**
- Matrix version testing (multiple Node/Python/Go versions)
- Secrets-based scans (Snyk, SAST tools needing tokens)
- Deployment / release workflows
- Flaky or environment-sensitive tests that need a clean VM

#### CLI End-to-End Testing

If the project is a CLI tool, create a local E2E test script that exercises every command and subcommand. The goal is to verify the CLI actually works end-to-end, not just that the code compiles.

**Discover all commands:**
```bash
# For Python click/typer apps:
python -m myapp --help
python -m myapp <subcommand> --help

# For Go cobra/urfave apps:
./myapp --help
./myapp <subcommand> --help

# For Node.js commander/yargs:
node cli.js --help
```

Create `scripts/e2e_test.sh` (or `scripts/e2e_test.py` for Python) that:
1. Builds/installs the CLI in a temp environment
2. Runs each command with representative inputs (including edge cases: empty input, invalid flags, `--help`)
3. Asserts exit codes and key output patterns
4. Cleans up temp artifacts

Example structure for a Python CLI:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "=== E2E: CLI smoke tests ==="
# Test each command/subcommand
python -m myapp --version
python -m myapp --help
python -m myapp subcommand1 --help
python -m myapp subcommand1 --input tests/fixtures/sample.txt
python -m myapp subcommand2 --flag value
# Test error paths
python -m myapp unknown-command 2>&1 | grep -q "Error" && echo "✓ unknown command error"
echo "=== E2E: All passed ==="
```

Wire this into pre-commit on the `push` stage:
```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: e2e-cli
      name: CLI end-to-end tests
      entry: bash scripts/e2e_test.sh
      language: system
      pass_filenames: false
      stages: [push]
```

Install hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push  # also install push-stage hooks
pre-commit run --all-files  # Test on existing code
```

### 3. Create GitHub Actions Workflows (lean CI)

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — but keep it lean since pre-commit already catches most issues. See [references/github-actions.md](references/github-actions.md) for workflow templates.

GitHub Actions responsibilities (things pre-commit can't do):
- Matrix testing across language versions (important for libraries)
- Upload coverage reports (Codecov, etc.)
- Deployment on merge to main
- PR status comments/badges
- Secrets-dependent scans

Since pre-commit already runs lint, format, type-check, unit tests, and E2E tests — the CI workflow can be simpler: install deps → run pre-commit → run tests with coverage upload → build artifact.

```yaml
# Minimal CI when pre-commit covers everything locally:
- name: Run pre-commit
  run: pre-commit run --all-files

- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: <test-command> --cov --cov-report=xml

- name: Upload coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
```

### 4. Verify Pipeline

```bash
# Test all pre-commit hooks (commit stage)
pre-commit run --all-files

# Test push-stage hooks (includes E2E)
pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage push

# Verify the CLI E2E script directly
bash scripts/e2e_test.sh
```

If all local checks pass, GitHub Actions becomes a thin verification layer, not the primary quality gate.

## Tool Selection by Language

| Language | Formatter | Linter | Type Check | Security | Tests |
|----------|-----------|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| JS/TS | Prettier | ESLint | tsc | npm audit | Jest/Vitest |
| Python | Ruff/Black | Ruff | mypy | Bandit + detect-secrets | pytest |
| Go | gofmt | golangci-lint | built-in | gosec | go test |
| Rust | rustfmt | Clippy | built-in | cargo-audit | cargo test |
| Java | google-java-format | Checkstyle | - | SpotBugs | mvn test |

## What Runs Where

| Check | Pre-commit (commit) | Pre-commit (push) | GitHub Actions |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Formatting | ✓ | — | — |
| Linting | ✓ | — | — |
| Type checking | ✓ | — | — |
| Security scan (offline) | ✓ | — | — |
| Unit tests (fast) | ✓ | — | — |
| Full test suite | — | ✓ | ✓ (coverage upload) |
| CLI E2E tests | — | ✓ | — |
| Multi-version matrix | — | — | ✓ |
| Deploy | — | — | ✓ |

## Step Completion Reports

After completing each major step, output a status report in this format:

```
◆ [Step Name] ([step N of M] — [context])
··································································
  [Check 1]:          √ pass
  [Check 2]:          √ pass (note if relevant)
  [Check 3]:          × fail — [reason]
  [Check 4]:          √ pass
  [Criteria]:         √ N/M met
  ____________________________
  Result:             PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL
```

Adapt the check names to match what the step actually validates. Use `√` for pass, `×` for fail, and `—` to add brief context. The "Criteria" line summarizes how many acceptance criteria were met. The "Result" line gives the overall verdict.

### Skill-specific checks per phase

**Phase: Project Analysis** — checks: `Project detection`, `Existing tooling scan`, `CLI detection`, `Command enumeration`

**Phase: Pre-commit Configuration** — checks: `Pre-commit setup`, `Hook installation`, `Push-stage hooks installed`, `E2E script created (if CLI)`

**Phase: GitHub Actions Setup** — checks: `GitHub Actions config`, `CI lean (pre-commit deduplication)`, `Matrix testing configured`

**Phase: Pipeline Verification** — checks: `Commit-stage hooks pass`, `Push-stage hooks pass`, `E2E tests pass (if CLI)`
