# PRD Generator

Generate comprehensive Product Requirements Documents from validated idea files.

## Repo Sync Before Edits (mandatory)
Before creating/updating/deleting files in an existing repository, sync the current branch with remote:

```bash
branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
git fetch origin
git pull --rebase origin "$branch"
```

If the working tree is not clean, stash first, sync, then restore:

```bash
git stash push -u -m "pre-sync"
branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
git fetch origin && git pull --rebase origin "$branch"
git stash pop
```

If `origin` is missing, pull is unavailable, or rebase/stash conflicts occur, stop and ask the user before continuing.

## Input

Preferred: project folder path in `$ARGUMENTS` containing:
- `idea.md` - Product concept and technical context (required)
- `validate.md` - Evaluation and recommendations (required)

If path is not provided (auto-pick mode):
1. Reuse the most recent project folder path from this chat/session (typically from idea-validator output).
2. If unavailable, use env var `IDEAS_ROOT` when present.
3. Else check shared marker file `~/.config/ideas-root.txt`.
4. Backward compatibility fallback: `~/.openclaw/ideas-root.txt`.
5. If still unavailable, ask the user to provide the path or set `IDEAS_ROOT`.
6. If multiple candidates are plausible, ask user to choose.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Validate Input

1. Resolve `PROJECT_DIR` (from `$ARGUMENTS` or auto-pick mode above)
2. Check `PROJECT_DIR/idea.md` exists
3. Check `PROJECT_DIR/validate.md` exists
4. If `PROJECT_DIR/prd.md` exists, create backup: `prd.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`

### Phase 2: Extract Context

From `idea.md`:
- Product name/concept
- Target audience
- Goals & objectives
- Technical context (stack, constraints)

From `validate.md`:
- Verdict and ratings
- Strengths/weaknesses
- Competitors
- Enhanced version suggestions
- Implementation roadmap

### Phase 3: Clarify Requirements

Ask user (if not clear from input files):
- Official product name?
- Business model? (SaaS, marketplace, freemium)
- Target MVP timeframe?
- Team size/composition?
- Compliance requirements? (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)

### Phase 4: Generate PRD

Create `prd.md` with these sections:

1. **Product Overview** - Vision, users, objectives, success metrics
2. **User Personas** - 2-3 detailed personas from target audience
3. **Feature Requirements** - Matrix with MoSCoW prioritization, user stories, acceptance criteria
4. **User Flows** - Primary flows with mermaid diagrams
5. **Non-Functional Requirements** - Performance, security, compatibility, accessibility
6. **Technical Specifications** - Architecture diagram, frontend/backend/infrastructure specs
7. **Analytics & Monitoring** - Key metrics, events, dashboards, alerts
8. **Release Planning** - MVP and version roadmap with checklists
9. **Open Questions & Risks** - Questions, assumptions, risk mitigation
10. **Appendix** - Competitive analysis, glossary, revision history

Read `references/prd-template.md` for the full template structure.

### Phase 5: Output

1. Write `prd.md` to project folder
2. Summarize sections created
3. Highlight areas needing user review
4. Suggest next steps

## Step Completion Reports

After completing each major step, output a status report in this format:

```
◆ [Step Name] ([step N of M] — [context])
··································································
  [Check 1]:          √ pass
  [Check 2]:          √ pass (note if relevant)
  [Check 3]:          × fail — [reason]
  [Check 4]:          √ pass
  [Criteria]:         √ N/M met
  ____________________________
  Result:             PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL
```

Adapt the check names to match what the step actually validates. Use `√` for pass, `×` for fail, and `—` to add brief context. The "Criteria" line summarizes how many acceptance criteria were met. The "Result" line gives the overall verdict.

### Phase-specific checks

**Phase 1 — Validate Input**
```
◆ Validate Input (step 1 of 5 — input resolution)
··································································
  Input files found:        √ pass
  Dependencies resolved:    √ pass (PROJECT_DIR confirmed)
  Backup created:           √ pass | — skipped (no existing prd.md)
  ____________________________
  Result:             PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL
```

**Phase 2 — Extract Context**
```
◆ Extract Context (step 2 of 5 — context extraction)
··································································
  idea.md parsed:           √ pass (concept + technical context read)
  validate.md parsed:       √ pass (verdict + ratings extracted)
  Context extracted:        √ pass (idea.md + validate.md read)
  ____________________________
  Result:             PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL
```

**Phase 3 — Clarify Requirements**
```
◆ Clarify Requirements (step 3 of 5 — requirements gathering)
··································································
  Questions answered:       √ pass
  Scope defined:            √ pass (MVP timeframe confirmed)
  Stakeholders identified:  √ pass (team size, compliance noted)
  ____________________________
  Result:             PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL
```

**Phase 4 — Generate PRD**
```
◆ Generate PRD (step 4 of 5 — document generation)
··································································
  10 sections written:      √ pass
  prd.md created:           √ pass
  Cross-references valid:   √ pass (mermaid diagrams render)
  ____________________________
  Result:             PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL
```

**Phase 5 — Output**
```
◆ Output (step 5 of 5 — delivery)
··································································
  File written:             √ pass
  Summary presented:        √ pass
  Next steps suggested:     √ pass
  ____________________________
  Result:             PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL
```

### Phase 6: README Maintenance (ideas repo)

After writing `prd.md`, if the project folder is inside an `ideas` repo, update the repo README ideas table:
- Preferred: `cd` to the repo root and run `python3 scripts/update_readme_ideas_index.py` (if it exists)
- Fallback: update `README.md` manually (ensure PRD status becomes ✅ for that idea)

### Phase 7: Commit and push (mandatory)

- Commit immediately after updates.
- Push immediately to remote.
- If push is rejected: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main && git push`.

Do not ask for additional push permission once this skill is invoked.

## Reporting with GitHub links (mandatory)
When reporting completion, include:
- GitHub link to `prd.md`
- GitHub link to `README.md` when it was updated
- Commit hash

Link format (derive `<owner>/<repo>` from `git remote get-url origin`):
- `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/main/<relative-path>`

## Modification Mode

If user wants to modify existing PRD:
1. Create timestamped backup
2. Ask what to modify (features, priorities, timeline, specs, personas)
3. Apply changes preserving structure
4. Update revision history

## Guidelines

- **Thorough**: Cover all sections comprehensively
- **Realistic**: Base on validate.md feasibility ratings
- **Specific**: Include concrete metrics and criteria
- **Actionable**: Every section guides implementation
- **Visual**: Include mermaid diagrams for architecture and flows
