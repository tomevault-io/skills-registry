# rust-coding

## Mission
- Own safe, idiomatic Rust patterns for the engine codebase.

## When To Load
- Write Rust code.
- Review Rust code.
- Refactor Rust modules.

## When To Skip
- Lua scripts.
- CAG files.
- Docs-only work.

## Domain Knowledge
- mod.rs in src/ must contain only `pub mod`, `pub use`, doc comments, and `#[allow]` attributes. Definitions belong in sibling files.
- No `#[cfg(test)]` blocks in src/. Unit tests for private code go in `tests/rust/unit/<module>_tests.rs`, named `<module>_tests.rs` not `<module>_test.rs`.
- When external tests need a private seam, prefer `pub(crate)` over `pub` and keep the exposed item narrow. Treat it as a testability boundary, not a public API expansion.
- If a `pub(crate)` seam exists only for tests, keep its doc comment explicit about that intent so future refactors do not promote it accidentally.
- `src/lua_api/*_api.rs` must stay thin: `LuaUserData` impls, `add_methods`, registration, and type conversions only. Business logic belongs in `src/<module>/`.
- Never hold `borrow_mut()` or `RefCell::borrow_mut()` across a Lua callback invocation. The pattern is: extract all needed values while holding the borrow, release it, then invoke Lua.
- SharedState access rule: `{ let guard = state.borrow(); let val = guard.field.clone(); } /* borrow released */ call_lua(val)`. The guard must be dropped before any call that might re-enter Rust.
- Pinned library versions: mlua 0.9, wgpu 22, winit 0.30, rapier2d 0.32, rodio 0.17, fontdue 0.9. Do not bump without explicit authorization; each bump needs wgpu/winit API adjustments.
- When a Rust change touches public types or functions visible through `lurek.*`, run `tools/python.cmd tools/validate/validate_lua_api.py` to catch shape drift in generated docs.
- Public changes must update `docs/specs/<module>.md` in the same commit. Compiler green does not mean the task is done.
- Use `?` for propagation but never let it cross a callback boundary silently. Closures passed to mlua must return `mlua::Result`; inner `?` should map errors before they reach Lua with a clear message.
- Keep `unsafe` blocks small, one-purpose, and accompanied by a `// SAFETY:` comment that explains the invariant. No `unsafe` for convenience when a safe alternative exists.
- Prefer explicit module imports over glob imports. Glob imports make it impossible to grep what the file actually depends on during refactors.
- Tests in `tests/rust/unit/` name their test functions `test_<behavior>_<condition>`. Keep each test assertion to one failure mode so failing tests name the problem immediately.

## Rustdoc Comment Standards â€” AI-First, Compact

Comments exist for AI agents reading the code. Goal: maximum signal per token. No prose, no repetition, no filler.

---

### Regular Rust files (`src/` excluding `src/lua_api/`)

**What requires a doc comment**
Every one of the following lines must have a `///` comment directly above it â€” no exceptions, no qualifications:
- `pub fn`, `pub async fn`
- `fn` (every private function, without exception)
- `pub struct`, `struct`
- `pub enum`, `enum`
- `pub mod` (every occurrence, in any file)
- `pub type`, `pub const`, `pub static`
- `impl Trait for Type` â€” one `///` line above: what the trait provides for this type
- Every field inside a struct â€” pub and private â€” one `///` line each
- Every variant inside an enum â€” one `///` line each

Plain `impl Type { }` (inherent impl): keep existing `///` comments and improve them. Add `///` when the block groups distinct functionality. Never remove existing `///` on impl blocks.

**File level (`//!`)**
Use bullet-point format: each line starts with `//! - `. Proportional to file size:
- Small file: ~300 characters, 3-4 bullets.
- Medium file: ~600 characters, 5-7 bullets.
- Large file: ~1200 characters, 8-12 bullets.

Content of bullets â€” describe in order:
1. What the file provides (capability groups, not individual symbol names).
2. How groups of related functions/types behave and what algorithms they use.
3. Design decisions: data representations, fallback behaviors, degenerate-path handling.
4. Integration notes: what kind of callers use this (runtime, tests, Lua bindings, tools).

**Do NOT list individual function names, struct names, or method names.** Describe capabilities and behaviors. The reader can see declarations â€” the `//!` block explains WHY this file exists and HOW its pieces relate.

Reference example (`src/math/geometry.rs`):
> //! - Provides standalone 2D geometry algorithms over scalar coordinates and flat vertex arrays.
> //! - Basic helpers compute angle between points, circle point containment, circle-circle overlap, line-circle intersections, and segment-circle intersections.
> //! - Polygon helpers compute signed area, centroid with arithmetic-mean fallback for degenerate polygons, point-in-polygon by ray casting, and convex hull by Andrew monotone chain.
> //! - Functions favor simple tuples and slices so they can be used from runtime code, tests, and Lua bindings without owning heavier geometry types.
> //! - Degenerate paths generally return conservative values such as empty result sets, arithmetic centroids, or false intersections instead of panicking.

**Struct (`///`)**
One line: role in the system + which other type uses it.
Every field â€” pub and private â€” one `///` line: what it holds + range/units/invariant when non-obvious.

**Enum (`///`)**
One line: purpose. Every variant: one line â€” when it applies.

**Impl blocks (`///`)**
Every `impl Trait for Type` block gets one `///` line above it: what the trait provides for this type.
Plain `impl Type { }` blocks (inherent impl): if a `///` comment already exists, keep and improve it. When adding new impl blocks, a `///` comment is optional but recommended when the block groups a distinct set of related methods (e.g. constructors, getters, serialization helpers). Never remove an existing `///` on a plain impl.

**Methods and functions (`///`)**
One line only. State what it does AND what it returns, including edge cases inline.
No `# Arguments`, no `# Returns`, no `# Errors` sections.

Single compact example (only one):
- `/// Decodes file and returns chunk decoder; returns error on open/decode failure.`

**Forbidden Phrases in Rustdoc**
- No AI-generated prose: "returns a fully initialised instance", "the insertion is O(1) amortised", "this accessor incurs no allocation", "call it freely in hot paths".
- No synonym inflation: "alias for `foo()`", "alias of `foo()`", "shorthand for", "convenience wrapper".
- No placeholders: "placeholder", "empty placeholder", "tombstone", "replacement value".
- No `incurs no allocation`, `O(1)`, `amortised` â€” these are implementation details, not user-facing docs.
- No `returns` when opening a function doc. Use imperative: "Return" or "Read" or "Parse" instead of "Returns".

**Rules (tool-aligned)**
- Enforced by tools: every `.rs` file has `//!` module doc.
- Enforced by tools: every `pub` item has `///` doc.
- Tooling parses plain `///` and `//!` text; no structured rustdoc sections are required by scanners.
- Keep comments compact one-liners when possible to minimize token cost for AI agents.
- For regular files, avoid `# Arguments` / `# Returns` / `# Errors` sections unless a prompt explicitly requires them.
- Every doc comment must be a concrete technical fact, not a sentence structure template.

### Lua API files (`src/lua_api/`)

These files expose `lurek.*` to Lua. Contract source of truth is `tools/validate/validate_lua_api.py`.

**File level (`//!`)**
Use canonical header format expected by validator.
- Format: ``//! `lurek.<module>` -- <concrete description>``.
- Example: ``//! `lurek.audio` -- Audio bindings for source playback, bus routing, and DSP controls.``


**Structs, fields, enums, helpers in `src/lua_api/`**
Same compact one-liner rule as all other Rust files. No `# Fields` block.
- Example struct line: ``/// Lua-side handle for an audio source registered in `Mixer`.``
- Example field line: ``/// Slot-map key identifying this source in `Mixer`.``
- This applies to private helpers too: every helper function gets one concrete `///` line.


**Docs for Lua-registered calls only**
Only methods/functions actually registered to Lua (`methods.add_method`, `methods.add_method_mut`, `methods.add_function`, `tbl.set(... create_function ...)`) must use verbose tagged markers.
- Required shape above each registered call:
- One summary `///` line.
- Zero or more `@param` lines when method takes Lua args.
- At least one `@return` line always.
- Example: ``/// Sets playback volume.`` + ``/// @param | vol | number | Volume multiplier, clamped to >= 0.0.`` + ``/// @return | nil | No value is returned.``


**Marker format (required)**
- `/// @param | <lua_name> | <lua_type> | <description>`
- `/// @return | <lua_type> | <description>`
- `lua_type` values: `number`, `integer`, `string`, `boolean`, `nil`, `Source`, `Bus`, `table`, etc.
- Every registered Lua call must have at least one `@return` marker.
- Keep `@param` / `@return` descriptions to one line â€” they appear verbatim in generated API docs.
- Do not mix marker styles: never use `@param name : type` in files validated by `validate_lua_api.py`.

**Validator-enforced checks (must stay true)**
- Header exists and matches ``//! `lurek.<module>` ...``.
- `pub fn register(...)` exists and has canonical Lua/LuaTable signature.
- No rustdoc sections `/// # Parameters` or `/// # Returns`.
- Tagged docs use exact pipe format:
    - `/// @param | name | type | description`
    - `/// @return | type | description`
- No `@return | any | ...`.
- No optional/union return types.

**Forbidden in `src/lua_api/`**
- `/// # Parameters`
- `/// # Returns`
- `@return | any | ...`
- Optional/union return types like `number?`, `number, nil`, `Type|nil`
## Companion File Index
- None.
