# Make Custom Agent

Create properly structured GitHub Copilot custom agent files. Custom agents are specialized workflows with tailored expertise for specific development tasks.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "create an agent", "make custom agent", "scaffold agent"
- Need specialized workflow for specific task types
- Want focused behavior for testing, planning, refactoring, security, etc.
- Creating task-specific assistants that can be assigned to issues

## When NOT to Use

- ❌ Need general rules for all files → Use **Instruction** instead
- ❌ Need reference documentation → Use **Skill** instead
- ❌ Need always-active prescriptive rules → Use **Instruction** instead

**See copilot.instructions.md for decision criteria**

## What Are Custom Agents?

**Custom Agents** (`.agent.md` files) are specialized Copilot configurations that:
- Define focused behavior for specific tasks
- Control which tools the agent can access
- Set AI model preferences
- Provide domain expertise and instructions
- Can be assigned to GitHub issues
- Are selectable in Copilot Chat dropdown

**Examples:**
- `test-specialist.agent.md` - Focuses on writing and improving tests
- `implementation-planner.agent.md` - Creates technical specifications
- `security-reviewer.agent.md` - Analyzes code for security issues
- `refactoring-expert.agent.md` - Improves code structure

## Custom Agents vs Skills vs Instructions

| Feature | Custom Agent | Skill | Instruction |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **File** | `.agent.md` | `SKILL.md` | `.instructions.md` |
| **Location** | `.github/agents/` | `.github/skills/` | `.github/instructions/` |
| **Purpose** | Specialized workflow | Knowledge base | Prescriptive rules |
| **Activation** | User selects | Auto-loaded by description | Auto-loaded by file type |
| **Tools** | Can limit tools | N/A | N/A |
| **Length** | Max 30,000 chars | 500-1,500 lines | 100-800 lines |
| **Content** | Behavioral instructions | Reference documentation | DO's/DON'Ts |

## Prerequisites

- Clear understanding of the specialized task
- Defined scope and responsibilities
- List of required tools
- Behavioral guidelines

## Creating a Custom Agent

### Step 1: Choose Location and Name

**Location:** `.github/agents/{name}.agent.md`

**Naming Convention:**
- Lowercase with hyphens
- Should end with `.agent.md` (recommended) or `.md`
- Descriptive of the agent's role

**Examples:**
- `test-specialist.agent.md` (recommended)
- `implementation-planner.agent.md` (recommended)
- `security-reviewer.md` (also valid)
- `api-designer.agent.md` (recommended)
- `terraform-expert.agent.md` (recommended)

**Note:** While `.md` extension works, using `.agent.md` makes it immediately clear the file is a custom agent configuration.

### Step 2: Define Agent Properties

**Required YAML Properties:**

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description of what the agent does and its capabilities
---
```

**Optional YAML Properties:**

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: What the agent does

# Optional: Limit which tools the agent can use
tools: ["read", "edit", "search"]

# Optional: Set AI model (VS Code, JetBrains, Eclipse, Xcode only)
model: claude-3.5-sonnet

# Optional: Limit where agent can be used
target: vscode  # or "github-copilot"

# Optional: Configure MCP servers (organization/enterprise agents only)
mcp-servers:
  server-name:
    command: node
    args: ["/path/to/server.js"]
---
```

### Step 3: Write Agent Prompt

**Structure:**

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description
tools: ["tool1", "tool2"]
---

You are a [role] focused on [primary responsibility]. Your responsibilities:

- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]
- [Responsibility 3]

[Behavioral guidelines and constraints]

[Output format expectations]
```

**Maximum Length:** 30,000 characters

### Step 4: Define Tools Access

**Tool Options:**

| Category | Tools | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **File Operations** | `read`, `edit`, `create`, `delete` | File manipulation |
| **Search** | `search`, `grep` | Code search |
| **Git** | `git`, `commit`, `branch` | Version control |
| **Terminal** | `terminal`, `run` | Command execution |
| **MCP Tools** | `mcp-server/tool-name` | Custom MCP server tools |

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Enable all tools (default if omitted)
tools: []

# Limit to read-only operations
tools: ["read", "search"]

# Planning agent - no code modification
tools: ["read", "search", "edit"]  # edit for markdown only

# Full access for implementation
tools: ["read", "edit", "create", "delete", "git", "terminal"]

# Custom MCP tools
tools: ["read", "edit", "github-mcp/list_issues", "github-mcp/create_pr"]
```

## Agent Templates

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Scope Definition

```markdown
# ✅ Good - Clear boundaries
You are a testing specialist focused on improving test coverage.
Focus only on test files and avoid modifying production code unless specifically requested.

# ❌ Bad - Vague scope
You are a helpful assistant that can do various things.
```

### 2. Specific Responsibilities

```markdown
# ✅ Good - Specific tasks
Your responsibilities:
- Analyze existing tests and identify coverage gaps
- Write unit tests following AAA pattern
- Ensure tests are isolated and deterministic

# ❌ Bad - Generic tasks
Your responsibilities:
- Help with code
- Make improvements
```

### 3. Behavioral Constraints

```markdown
# ✅ Good - Clear constraints
DO NOT modify production code directly - provide recommendations instead.
Always run tests before and after changes.

# ❌ Bad - No constraints
Make whatever changes you think are best.
```

### 4. Output Format Expectations

```markdown
# ✅ Good - Defined format
Output format:
1. **Issues Found** - List of problems
2. **Severity** - Critical/High/Medium/Low
3. **Remediation** - Specific fixes
4. **References** - Relevant standards

# ❌ Bad - Unstructured
Provide your analysis.
```

### 5. Tool Limitation

```yaml
# ✅ Good - Appropriate tools for planning
name: implementation-planner
tools: ["read", "search", "edit"]  # No code execution

# ⚠️ Risky - Planning agent with full access
name: implementation-planner
tools: []  # Has access to terminal, git, delete, etc.
```

## Common Agent Patterns

### Pattern 1: Read-Only Reviewer

**Use Case:** Code review, security analysis, architecture review

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and best practices
tools: ["read", "search"]
---

You are a code reviewer...
- Analyze code quality
- Identify issues
- Provide recommendations
DO NOT modify files directly
```

### Pattern 2: Test-Focused Developer

**Use Case:** Writing tests, improving test coverage

```yaml
---
name: test-writer
description: Writes comprehensive tests for existing code
tools: ["read", "search", "edit", "create", "terminal"]
---

You are a testing specialist...
- Write unit and integration tests
- Ensure high coverage
- Run tests to verify
DO NOT modify production code
```

### Pattern 3: Documentation Generator

**Use Case:** Creating technical documentation

```yaml
---
name: doc-writer
description: Creates comprehensive technical documentation
tools: ["read", "search", "edit", "create"]
---

You are a technical writer...
- Analyze code structure
- Generate API docs
- Create usage examples
Focus on markdown files only
```

### Pattern 4: Full-Stack Implementer

**Use Case:** Implementing features end-to-end

```yaml
---
name: feature-implementer
description: Implements features with code, tests, and documentation
tools: ["read", "edit", "create", "delete", "git", "terminal"]
---

You are a full-stack developer...
- Implement features
- Write tests
- Update documentation
- Commit changes
Follow all coding standards
```

## Validation Checklist

Before committing a custom agent:

- [ ] File ends with `.agent.md` (recommended) or `.md`
- [ ] Located in `.github/agents/`
- [ ] Has `name` in YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Has `description` in YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Name is lowercase with hyphens
- [ ] Description is clear and specific
- [ ] Tools are appropriately limited (if not all tools needed)
- [ ] Prompt is under 30,000 characters
- [ ] Responsibilities are clearly defined
- [ ] Behavioral constraints are specified
- [ ] Output format is defined (if applicable)
- [ ] Agent has been tested with sample tasks

## Testing Your Custom Agent

### In VS Code

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat
2. Click agent dropdown
3. Select your custom agent
4. Test with relevant prompts

### On GitHub.com

1. Navigate to https://github.com/copilot/agents
2. Select your repository
3. Your agent should appear in the list
4. Test by assigning to an issue or using in chat

### In GitHub Copilot CLI

```bash
# Use with slash command
gh copilot /agent test-specialist "Review test coverage"

# Reference in prompt
gh copilot "Using test-specialist, analyze our tests"
```

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Agent Not Appearing

**Problem:** Custom agent doesn't show up in dropdown

**Solutions:**
- Verify file is in `.github/agents/` directory
- Check file ends with `.agent.md` (or at least `.md`)
- Ensure YAML frontmatter is valid
- Commit and push to default branch
- Refresh the agents page

### Issue 2: Agent Uses Wrong Tools

**Problem:** Agent performs actions outside its scope

**Solution:** Explicitly limit tools in YAML:

```yaml
---
name: security-reviewer
tools: ["read", "search"]  # No edit, create, delete, etc.
---
```

### Issue 3: Agent Behavior Too Broad

**Problem:** Agent doesn't stay focused on its specialty

**Solution:** Add explicit constraints in prompt:

```markdown
Focus ONLY on test files.
DO NOT modify production code.
If production code changes are needed, provide recommendations instead.
```

### Issue 4: Prompt Too Long

**Problem:** Exceeds 30,000 character limit

**Solution:**
- Remove verbose examples
- Use bullet points instead of paragraphs
- Reference external skills/instructions
- Focus on core behaviors only

## Migration from Skill to Agent

If you have a skill that should be an agent:

**Skill:** Knowledge base loaded on-demand
**Agent:** Specialized workflow with tool access

```markdown
# BEFORE: terraform-expert skill
# Reference documentation for Terraform

# AFTER: terraform-expert agent
---
name: terraform-expert
tools: ["read", "edit", "search", "create", "terminal"]
---

You are a Terraform expert...
- Write Terraform code
- Run terraform fmt/validate
- Create modules and examples
```

## Organization/Enterprise Level Agents

For organization or enterprise-wide agents:

**Location:** `.github-private` repository (not `.github`)

**File:** `.github-private/agents/{name}.agent.md` (not in `agents/` subdirectory)

**Availability:** Available across all repositories in org/enterprise

**MCP Servers:** Can configure custom MCP servers

```yaml
---
name: org-security-scanner
description: Organization-wide security analysis
mcp-servers:
  security-scanner:
    command: node
    args: ["/path/to/scanner.js"]
tools: ["read", "search", "security-scanner/scan"]
---

You are the organization's security scanner...
```
