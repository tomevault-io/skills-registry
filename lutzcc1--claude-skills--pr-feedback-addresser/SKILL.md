# PR Feedback Addresser

This skill helps address PR review comments systematically while following Sprout's Rails conventions and ensuring code quality.

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order:

### 1. Fetch PR Information

First, identify the current PR:

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,url,comments,reviewThreads,files
```

If no PR is found for the current branch, ask the user for the PR number.

### 2. Parse and Organize Comments

- Extract all review comments and threads from the PR
- Group comments by file and line number
- Present comments to the user in a clear, organized format
- Ask the user if they want to address all comments or specific ones

### 3. Address Each Comment Systematically

For each comment to address, make an attack plan (use subagents to plan the code change):

1. **Read the relevant code** - Use the Read tool to view the file and surrounding context
2. **Understand the feedback** - Analyze what the reviewer is asking for
3. **Make a plan for how to address this comment** - If it's not a simple change, make a multi-steps plan to address the comment.
4. **Implement the change** following Sprout conventions
5. **Make focused edits** - Address the specific feedback without unnecessary changes

### 4. Quality Checks

After making changes:

1. **Run RuboCop on changed files:**

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only | grep '\.rb$' | xargs rubocop -a
   ```

2. **Fix any remaining RuboCop issues:**

   - Review remaining violations
   - Fix manually if autocorrect doesn't handle them
   - Run `rubocop -a` again if needed

3. **Identify and run relevant tests:**

   - For changed files in `app/`, run corresponding test files
   - For service changes: Run tests in `test/with_seeds/services/`
   - For controller changes: Run tests in `test/with_seeds/controllers/`
   - For model changes: Run tests in `test/with_seeds/models/`
   - Example: `rails test test/with_seeds/services/specific_service_test.rb`

4. **Address test failures:**
   - If tests fail, analyze the failure
   - Fix the issue following project conventions
   - Re-run tests to confirm fix
   - **Use Oaken seeds for test data** - Do not create/update records in tests unless absolutely necessary
   - Avoid using `cases/accounts/standard_lies` seed (deprecated)

### 5. Summary and Next Steps

After addressing all comments:

1. **Summarize changes made:**

   - List each comment addressed
   - Confirm all tests passing

2. **Prepare for commit:**

   - DO NOT create a commit automatically
   - Wait for user's explicit approval before committing
   - When you get commit approval, follow conventional commit format (one commit per addressed comment)

3. **Remind about workflow:**
   - User should review changes
   - Commit when ready with atomic, conventional commits
   - Push to update PR

## Example Usage

**User:** "Address the PR feedback"

**Skill actions:**

1. Fetch PR comments via `gh pr view`
2. Display organized list of comments
3. For each comment:
   - Show the feedback
   - Implement the requested change
   - Run rubocop on the file
   - Run relevant tests
4. Summarize all changes
5. Wait for user approval before committing

## Error Handling

- If `gh` CLI is not authenticated, provide instructions to run `gh auth login`
- If tests fail, fix issues before proceeding to next comment
- If RuboCop fails, address violations before continuing
- If a comment is unclear, ask the user for clarification

## Notes

- This skill is non-committal - it never creates commits without explicit approval
- Always validate changes with tests before marking a comment as addressed
- Be critical of suggested changes; challenge if they don't follow best practices
- Use WebSearch to research solutions when planning implementation
- NEVER respond to comments in GitHub, you're only allowed to read comments.
- Ignore not actionable comments ("love this", "good job", "nice touch", etc.)
