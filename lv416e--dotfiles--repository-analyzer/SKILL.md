# Repository Analyzer Skill

This skill provides a systematic approach to analyzing any code repository through multi-source investigation and critical evaluation.

## Purpose

Enable Claude to perform thorough repository analysis by:
1. Exploring codebase structure and organization using Explore agents
2. Identifying technology stack and dependencies
3. Researching best practices via web search
4. Fetching authoritative documentation via Context7
5. Evaluating configuration quality and completeness
6. Assessing documentation and maintainability
7. Providing actionable recommendations

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when users request:
- "Analyze this repository"
- "Audit the codebase"
- "Report on this repository's structure"
- "Investigate the current repository"
- "What technologies does this repo use?"
- "Review the repository configuration"
- "Assess the documentation quality"

## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Repository Discovery & Scoping

**Identify Repository Context:**

1. **Location & Scope**
   ```bash
   # Determine working directory
   pwd

   # Check if it's a git repository
   git rev-parse --show-toplevel

   # Get repository metadata
   git remote -v
   git log --oneline -n 10
   ```

2. **Initial Structure Assessment**
   - Use Explore agent with "medium" thoroughness
   - Identify root-level files and directories
   - Locate key configuration files
   - Determine primary language(s)

**Prompt for Explore Agent (Phase 1):**
```
Explore the repository at [path] with medium thoroughness.

Find and report:
1. Directory structure (major folders and their purposes)
2. Configuration files (package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, etc.)
3. Primary programming languages (by file extensions)
4. Entry points (main files, executables)
5. Documentation files (README, docs/, etc.)
6. Build/deployment files (Dockerfile, Makefile, CI configs)
```

### Phase 2: Technology Stack Analysis

**Identify All Technologies:**

1. **Programming Languages**
   - Analyze file extensions
   - Check language-specific config files
   - Determine primary vs. secondary languages

2. **Package Managers & Dependencies**
   - Node.js: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
   - Python: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile`, `poetry.lock`
   - Rust: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`
   - Ruby: `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`
   - Go: `go.mod`, `go.sum`
   - PHP: `composer.json`, `composer.lock`
   - Other: `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, etc.

3. **Frameworks & Libraries**
   - Read package manager files
   - Identify major dependencies
   - Categorize: frontend, backend, testing, tooling

4. **Development Tools**
   - Version managers: `.nvmrc`, `.ruby-version`, `.tool-versions`
   - Formatters: `.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc`, `rustfmt.toml`
   - Linters: `.eslintrc`, `pylint.rc`, `.rubocop.yml`
   - Type checkers: `tsconfig.json`, `mypy.ini`

5. **Infrastructure & Deployment**
   - Docker: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
   - CI/CD: `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/`
   - Cloud: `terraform/`, `cloudformation/`, `k8s/`

**Prompt for Explore Agent (Phase 2):**
```
Explore the repository for technology stack identification with very thorough mode.

Search for and analyze:
1. All package manager files (package.json, Cargo.toml, requirements.txt, etc.)
2. Configuration files for development tools
3. Docker and containerization files
4. CI/CD pipeline configurations
5. Infrastructure as code files

**Claude Skills Used:** repository-analyzer, deep-research (if applicable)
**Tools Used:** Explore agent, Context7, WebSearch, Read, Grep, Glob
```

## Execution Strategy

### Parallel vs Sequential

**Run in Parallel (when possible):**
- Multiple Explore agent investigations (different aspects)
- Web searches for different technologies
- Context7 lookups for multiple libraries

**Run Sequentially (when needed):**
1. Discovery first (need to know structure)
2. Technology identification second (need to know what to research)
3. Deep dives third (need context from earlier phases)
4. Synthesis last (need all information)

### Time Management

**Estimated Duration:**
- Small repository (< 100 files): 10-15 minutes
- Medium repository (100-1000 files): 15-30 minutes
- Large repository (> 1000 files): 30-60 minutes

**Optimization:**
- Use Explore agent efficiently (right thoroughness level)
- Don't read every file - sample strategically
- Focus on high-impact findings
- Prioritize actionable insights

### Thoroughness Levels

**Quick Audit (10 min):**
- Phase 1-3 only
- Basic structure, tech stack, major issues

**Standard Analysis (30 min):**
- Phase 1-6
- Complete overview with recommendations

**Deep Audit (60 min):**
- All phases
- Comprehensive analysis with detailed recommendations

**Custom Focus:**
Ask user what aspects to prioritize if time is limited.

   - Acknowledge what you don't know
   - State confidence levels
   - Suggest areas for human expert review

## Notes

- **Scope Management:** For very large repositories, ask user to specify focus areas
- **Permissions:** Some operations may require user approval (file reads, web searches)
- **Time Awareness:** Inform user of estimated duration upfront
- **Iteration:** Offer to deep-dive into specific areas after initial report
- **Export:** Offer to save report as markdown file in repository
