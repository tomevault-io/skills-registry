# PRISM Token Scanner

Scan any crypto token for safety risks using Strykr PRISM's unique analysis endpoints.

## Quick Usage

```bash
# Scan by symbol
./scan.sh PEPE

# Scan by contract address
./scan.sh 0x6982508145454Ce325dDbE47a25d4ec3d2311933

# Get JSON output
./scan.sh PEPE --json
```

## What It Checks

| Holder Concentration | `/analytics/holders` | Medium |
| Liquidity Status | `/analyze` | High |
| Contract Verification | `/analyze` | Medium |
| Token Age | `/analyze` | Low |
| Rebrand History | `/analyze/rebrand` | Info |

## Risk Score Calculation

```
