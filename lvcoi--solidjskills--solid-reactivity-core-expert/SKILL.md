# solid-reactivity-core-expert

## Trigger

Use for reactivity correctness decisions involving `createSignal`, `createMemo`, `createEffect`, `createResource`, `batch`, `untrack`.

## Required Inputs

- State ownership and mutation boundaries.
- Current or planned derivations.
- Side effects and async behavior.

## Workflow

1. Classify each reactive operation as state, derivation, side effect, or async boundary.
2. Replace effect-driven derivations with memo/signal derivations when possible.
3. Confirm dependency tracking is minimal and explicit.
4. Provide handoff notes to macro skill for implementation/refactor/review.

## Failure Modes

- Unknown state ownership: require explicit owner boundary.
- Effect loops detected: mark as blocking issue and propose memo-driven rewrite.
- Async without loading/error semantics: add resource state matrix.

## Output Contract

Return `DomainGuidanceOutput` with decisions, handoff steps, validation commands, and citations containing `doc_id`.

## Validation

- `node tools/scripts/validate-skills.mjs --skill solid-reactivity-core-expert`
- `node tools/scripts/validate-solid-corpus.mjs`

## Key Corpus References

Use these `doc_id` values with the `read_corpus_doc` MCP tool:

- `solid-core.reference.basic-reactivity.create-signal` — signal creation and update semantics
- `solid-core.reference.basic-reactivity.create-memo` — derivation caching rules
- `solid-core.reference.basic-reactivity.create-effect` — side-effect tracking and cleanup
- `solid-core.reference.basic-reactivity.create-resource` — async reactive data loading
- `solid-core.reference.reactive-utilities.batch` — grouped signal updates
