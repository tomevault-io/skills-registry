## Tools Overview

| Category | Commands | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Setup** | `init`, `link`, `login`, `logout` | project initialization and authentication |
| **Services** | `add`, `service`, `domain` | Managing services and custom domains |
| **Deploy** | `up`, `deploy`, `redeploy`, `down` | Deploying code and managing active deployments |
| **Env Vars** | `variables` | Managing environment variables and secrets |
| **Observability** | `logs`, `status` | Monitoring service health and build/deploy logs |
| **Environments** | `environment` | Creating and deleting environments |
| **Access** | `ssh`, `run`, `shell`, `connect` | Interactive access to containers and databases |

## Common Workflows

### 1. Project Setup & Linking
Before working, ensure you are authenticated and linked to the correct project:

```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link via interactive menu or project ID
railway link

# Check what you are linked to
railway status
```

### 2. Deployment Management
Deploy code and manage versions:

```bash
# Deploy current directory
railway up

# Deploy to a specific service
railway up --service my-service

# Detach from build logs (fire and forget)
railway up -d

# Redeploy latest version (useful for restarting)
railway redeploy --service my-service
```

### 3. Variable Management
Configure secrets and settings:

```bash
# List all variables
railway variables

# Set multiple variables
railway variables --set "PORT=8080" --set "NODE_ENV=production"

# Get variables in JSON format
railway variables --json
```

### 4. Troubleshooting & Inspection
Diagnose issues in production:

```bash
# View deployment logs
railway logs

# View build logs (if deployment failed)
railway logs --build

# SSH into the running container
railway ssh

# Run a command in the environment context
railway run -- dotnet --info
```

### 5. Environment Management
Work with multiple environments (Production, Staging, etc.):

```bash
# Create a new environment
railway environment new staging

# Link local directory to staging
railway link --environment staging

# Delete an environment
railway environment delete dev-test
```

## Best Practices

- **Use JSON Output**: When parsing output in scripts, always use the `--json` flag (e.g., `railway variables --json`).
- **Service Scoping**: Explicitly specify `--service` when working in a monorepo to avoid ambiguity.
- **Detached Deploys**: Use `railway up -d` for CI pipelines to avoid hanging on log streaming.
- **Environment Context**: Always verify your active environment with `railway status` before making destructive changes.
