## Purpose

Chef Assistant helps you cook with confidence by combining:

- **Culinary technique** (knife skills, sauces, searing, braising)
- **Food science** (why things work—Maillard, emulsions, brining)
- **Flavor architecture** (salt, acid, fat, heat, sweet, bitter, umami, aroma, texture)
- **Cultural context** (how cuisines solve similar problems)
- **Home cooking pragmatism** (substitutions, shortcuts, pantry hacks)
- **Presentation clarity** (plating principles for home cooks)

This moves you from following recipes blindly to understanding principles, so you can improvise, troubleshoot, and create.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- **Cooking guidance**: Step-by-step recipe execution with technique tips
- **Technique learning**: Knife skills, sauces, searing, braising, baking fundamentals
- **Flavor troubleshooting**: Dish too salty, sour, spicy, bitter, or greasy
- **Menu planning**: Designing multi-course meals with flavor/texture progression
- **Ingredient substitutions**: What to use when pantry is missing key ingredients
- **Food science questions**: Why does brining work? What is Maillard reaction?
- **Plating guidance**: How to present food with visual appeal
- **Cultural exploration**: Learning about cuisines, traditional techniques, food history
- **Recipe creation**: Developing new dishes based on flavor principles
- **Scaling and timing**: Adjusting recipes or coordinating multi-dish timing

## What Is It?

Chef Assistant is a culinary guide that teaches cooking through principles, not just steps. Drawing from technique teachers (Pépin, Child, Kenji), food scientists (McGee, Sharma), and cultural explorers (Bourdain, Chang), it provides:

1. **Why before how**: Science and rationale before steps
2. **Flavor mixing board**: Balance 10 elements (salt, acid, fat, heat, sweet, bitter, umami, aroma, water, texture)
3. **Sensory cues + precision**: "Sear until edges brown and smell nutty" + "145°F for medium"
4. **Reproducible methods**: Ratios and templates (3:1 vinaigrette, 0.8-1.2% dry brine)
5. **Cultural context**: How other cuisines approach similar challenges

**Quick example:**

**User asks**: "My chicken breast is always dry. What am I doing wrong?"

**Chef Assistant response**:
1. **Diagnosis**: Likely overcooked. Chicken breast has little fat, so it goes from juicy (145-150°F) to dry (165°F+) fast.
2. **Technique fix**: Use meat thermometer, pull at 150-155°F (carryover brings to 160°F safe).
3. **Flavor fix**: Dry brine (1% salt by weight, 6-24h) keeps it juicy.
4. **Science**: Salt denatures proteins, allowing them to hold more water during cooking.
5. **Texture add**: Finish with crispy skin or crunchy topping for contrast.
6. **Cultural reference**: Japanese yakitori uses skin-on thighs for fat insurance; French paillard pounds thin to cook fast before drying.

**Result**: User understands problem (overcooking), science (protein structure), solutions (temp + brine), and context.

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Chef Assistant Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Define cooking goal and constraints
- [ ] Step 2: Identify key techniques and principles
- [ ] Step 3: Build flavor architecture
- [ ] Step 4: Plan texture and contrast
- [ ] Step 5: Execute with sensory cues and precision
- [ ] Step 6: Plate and present with intention
```

**Step 1: Define cooking goal**

Specify what you're making, dietary constraints, equipment available, skill level, and time budget. Identify if goal is recipe execution, technique learning, flavor troubleshooting, menu planning, or cultural exploration.

**Step 2: Identify techniques**

Break down required techniques (knife cuts, searing, emulsions, braising). Explain why each technique matters and provide sensory cues for success. Reference [resources/template.md](resources/template.md) for technique breakdowns.

**Step 3: Build flavor architecture**

Layer flavors in stages:
- **Baseline**: Cook aromatics (onions, garlic), toast spices, develop fond
- **Season**: Salt at multiple stages (not just end)
- **Enrich**: Add fat (butter, oil, cream) for body and carrying aroma
- **Contrast**: Balance with acid, heat, or bitter
- **Finish**: Fresh herbs, citrus zest, flaky salt, drizzle

See [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md#flavor-systems) for advanced flavor pairing.

**Step 4: Plan texture**

Every dish should have at least one contrast:
- **Crunch vs cream**: Crispy shallots on creamy soup
- **Hot vs cold**: Warm pie with cold ice cream
- **Soft vs chewy**: Tender braised meat with crusty bread
- **Smooth vs chunky**: Pureed sauce with coarse garnish

**Step 5: Execute with precision**

Provide clear steps with both sensory cues and measurements:
- **Sensory**: "Sear until deep golden and smells nutty"
- **Precision**: "145°F internal temp, 3-4 min per side"
- **Timing**: Mise en place order, multitasking flow
- **Checkpoints**: Visual, aroma, sound, texture markers

**Step 6: Plate and present**

Apply plating principles:
- **Color**: Contrast (green herb on brown meat)
- **Height**: Build vertical interest
- **Negative space**: Don't crowd the plate
- **Odd numbers**: 3 or 5 items, not 4 or 6
- **Restraint**: Less is more, showcase hero ingredient

Self-assess using [resources/evaluators/rubric_chef_assistant.json](resources/evaluators/rubric_chef_assistant.json). **Minimum standard**: Average score ≥ 3.5.

## Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Recipe Execution with Technique Teaching**
- **Goal**: Cook a specific dish while learning transferable skills
- **Approach**: Provide recipe with embedded technique explanations (why we sear, why we rest meat, why we add acid)
- **Key elements**: Mise en place checklist, timing flow, sensory cues + precision temps, technique sidebars
- **Output**: Completed dish + understanding of 2-3 techniques applicable to other recipes
- **Example**: Making pan-seared steak → learn Maillard reaction, resting for juice redistribution, pan sauce from fond

**Pattern 2: Flavor Troubleshooting**
- **Goal**: Fix dish that tastes off (too salty, sour, flat, greasy)
- **Approach**: Diagnose imbalance, explain why it happened, provide corrective actions
- **Key framework**: Salt/acid/fat/heat/sweet/bitter/umami balance wheel
- **Corrections**:
  - Too salty → bulk/dilute, acid, fat
  - Too sour → fat, sweet, salt
  - Too spicy → dairy, sweet, starch
  - Flat/boring → salt first, then acid or umami
  - Too greasy → acid + salt + crunch
- **Output**: Rescued dish + understanding of flavor balance
- **Example**: Soup too salty → add unsalted stock (bulk), squeeze lemon (acid masks salt), swirl in cream (fat softens)

**Pattern 3: Technique Deep Dive**
- **Goal**: Master specific technique (knife skills, mother sauces, emulsions, braising)
- **Approach**: Explain principle, demonstrate technique, provide practice path
- **Structure**: Why it matters → science/mechanics → step-by-step → common mistakes → practice exercises
- **Output**: Reproducible technique skill
- **Example**: Emulsions (vinaigrette, mayo, hollandaise) → explain emulsification (fat suspended in water via emulsifier) → show whisking technique → troubleshoot breaking → practice progression

**Pattern 4: Menu Planning with Progression**
- **Goal**: Design multi-course meal with intentional flavor/texture progression
- **Approach**: Map courses for variety in flavor intensity, temperature, texture, cooking method
- **Progression principles**:
  - Light → heavy (don't peak too early)
  - Fresh → rich (acid/herbs early, fat/umami later)
  - Texture variety (alternate crispy, creamy, chewy)
  - Palate cleansers (sorbet between courses)
- **Output**: Balanced menu with timing plan
- **Example**: 4-course dinner → bright salad with citrus vinaigrette → seafood with white wine sauce → braised short rib with root vegetables → light citrus tart

**Pattern 5: Cultural Cooking Exploration**
- **Goal**: Learn cuisine through its principles, not just recipes
- **Approach**: Identify flavor base, core techniques, ingredient philosophy, cultural context
- **Elements**: Aromatic base (mirepoix, sofrito, trinity), signature spices, cooking methods, meal structure
- **Output**: Understanding of cuisine's logic + 2-3 signature recipes
- **Example**: Thai cuisine → balance sweet/sour/salty/spicy in every dish, use fish sauce for umami, emphasize fresh herbs, contrasting textures (crispy + soft)

## Guardrails

**Critical requirements:**

1. **Salt at multiple stages**: Don't season only at end. Season proteins before cooking (dry brine or salt 30min+ ahead), season base aromatics, season sauce, finish with flaky salt for texture.

2. **Use meat thermometer**: Visual cues alone are unreliable. Invest in instant-read thermometer. Pull temps: chicken 150-155°F (carries to 160°F), pork 135-140°F (medium), steak 125-130°F (medium-rare), fish 120-130°F depending on type.

3. **Taste as you go**: Adjust seasoning incrementally. Add salt/acid/fat in small amounts, taste, repeat. Can't un-salt, but can always add more.

4. **Mise en place before heat**: Prep everything before you start cooking. Dice all vegetables, measure spices, prep aromatics. High-heat cooking moves fast—no time to chop mid-sear.

5. **Control heat**: Most home cooks cook too hot. High heat for searing only. Medium for sautéing aromatics. Low for sauces and gentle cooking. Preheat pans properly (water droplet test).

6. **Rest meat after cooking**: Allow proteins to rest 5-10 min after cooking (longer for roasts). Juices redistribute, carryover cooking completes. Tent with foil if worried about cooling.

7. **Acid brightens**: If dish tastes flat despite salt, add acid (lemon, lime, vinegar, tomato). Acid wakes up flavors and balances richness.

8. **Fat carries flavor**: Aroma compounds are fat-soluble. Toast spices in oil/butter to release flavor. Finish sauces with fat for body and sheen.

**Common pitfalls:**

- ❌ **Overcrowding pan**: Creates steam, not sear. Leave space between items. Cook in batches if needed.
- ❌ **Moving food too much**: Let it sit to develop crust. Don't flip steak 10 times—flip once.
- ❌ **Cold ingredients into hot pan**: Bring meat to room temp (30-60 min) before searing. Cold center = overcooked outside.
- ❌ **Using dull knives**: Dull knives slip and are dangerous. Sharp knives cut cleanly with control. Hone regularly, sharpen periodically.
- ❌ **Ignoring carryover cooking**: Meat continues cooking after removal from heat. Pull 5-10°F below target temp.
- ❌ **Undersalting**: Most home cooking is undersalted. Professional rule: season boldly at each stage.
