## Purpose

Create rigorous, validated models of entities, relationships, and constraints that enable correct system implementation, knowledge representation, and semantic reasoning.

## When to Use

**Invoke this skill when you need to:**
- Design database schema (SQL, NoSQL, graph) for new application
- Model complex domain with many entities and relationships
- Build knowledge graph or ontology for semantic search/reasoning
- Define API data models and contracts
- Create taxonomies or classification hierarchies
- Establish data governance and canonical models
- Migrate legacy schemas to modern architectures
- Resolve ambiguity in domain concepts and relationships
- Enable data integration across systems
- Document system invariants and business rules

**Common trigger phrases:**
- "Design a schema for..."
- "Model the entities and relationships"
- "Create a knowledge graph"
- "What's the data model?"
- "Define the ontology"
- "How should we structure this data?"
- "Map relationships between..."
- "Design the API data model"

## What Is It

**Data schema & knowledge modeling** is the process of formally defining:

1. **Entities** - Things that exist (User, Product, Order, Organization)
2. **Attributes** - Properties of entities (name, price, status, createdAt)
3. **Relationships** - Connections between entities (User owns Order, Product belongsTo Category)
4. **Constraints** - Rules and invariants (unique email, price > 0, one primary address)
5. **Cardinality** - How many of each (one-to-many, many-to-many)

**Quick example:** E-commerce schema:
- **Entities**: User, Product, Order, Cart, Payment
- **Relationships**: User has many Orders, Order contains many Products (via OrderItems), User has one Cart
- **Constraints**: Email must be unique, Order total matches sum of OrderItems, Payment amount equals Order total
- **Result**: Unambiguous model that prevents data inconsistencies

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Data Schema & Knowledge Modeling Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Gather domain requirements and scope
- [ ] Step 2: Identify entities and attributes
- [ ] Step 3: Define relationships and cardinality
- [ ] Step 4: Specify constraints and invariants
- [ ] Step 5: Validate and document the model
```

**Step 1: Gather domain requirements and scope**

Ask user for domain description, core use cases (what queries/operations will this support), existing data (if migration/integration), performance/scale requirements, and technology constraints (SQL vs NoSQL vs graph database). Understanding use cases shapes the model - OLTP vs OLAP vs graph traversal require different designs. See [Schema Types](#schema-types) for guidance.

**Step 2: Identify entities and attributes**

Extract nouns from requirements (those are candidate entities). For each entity, list attributes with types and nullability. Use [resources/template.md](resources/template.md) for systematic entity identification. Verify each entity represents a distinct concept with independent lifecycle. Document entity purpose and examples.

**Step 3: Define relationships and cardinality**

Map connections between entities (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). For many-to-many, identify junction tables/entities. Specify relationship directionality and optionality (can X exist without Y?). Use [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md) for complex relationship patterns like hierarchies, polymorphic associations, and temporal relationships.

**Step 4: Specify constraints and invariants**

Define uniqueness constraints, foreign key relationships, check constraints, and business rules. Document domain invariants (rules that must ALWAYS be true). Identify derived/computed attributes vs stored. Use [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md) for advanced constraint patterns and validation strategies.

**Step 5: Validate and document the model**

Create `data-schema-knowledge-modeling.md` file with complete schema definition. Validate against use cases - can the schema support required queries/operations? Check for normalization (eliminate redundancy) or denormalization (optimize for specific queries). Self-assess using [resources/evaluators/rubric_data_schema_knowledge_modeling.json](resources/evaluators/rubric_data_schema_knowledge_modeling.json). Minimum standard: Average score ≥ 3.5.

## Schema Types

Choose based on use case and technology:

**Relational (SQL) Schema**
- **Best for:** Transactional systems (OLTP), strong consistency, complex queries with joins
- **Pattern:** Normalized tables, foreign keys, ACID transactions
- **Example use cases:** E-commerce orders, banking transactions, HR systems
- **Key decision:** Normalization level (3NF for consistency vs denormalized for read performance)

**Document/NoSQL Schema**
- **Best for:** Flexible/evolving structure, high write throughput, denormalized reads
- **Pattern:** Nested documents, embedded relationships, no joins
- **Example use cases:** Content management, user profiles, event logs
- **Key decision:** Embed vs reference (embed for 1-to-few, reference for 1-to-many)

**Graph Schema (Ontology)**
- **Best for:** Complex relationships, traversal queries, semantic reasoning, knowledge graphs
- **Pattern:** Nodes (entities), edges (relationships), properties on both
- **Example use cases:** Social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines, scientific research
- **Key decision:** Property graph vs RDF triples

**Event/Time-Series Schema**
- **Best for:** Audit logs, metrics, IoT data, append-only data
- **Pattern:** Immutable events, time-based partitioning, aggregation tables
- **Example use cases:** User activity tracking, monitoring, financial transactions
- **Key decision:** Raw events vs pre-aggregated summaries

**Dimensional (Data Warehouse) Schema**
- **Best for:** Analytics (OLAP), aggregations, historical reporting
- **Pattern:** Fact tables + dimension tables (star/snowflake schema)
- **Example use cases:** Business intelligence, sales analytics, customer 360
- **Key decision:** Star schema (denormalized) vs snowflake (normalized dimensions)

## Common Patterns

**Pattern: Entity Lifecycle Modeling**
Track entity state changes explicitly. Example: Order (draft → pending → confirmed → shipped → delivered → completed/cancelled). Include status field, timestamps for each state, and transitions table if history needed.

**Pattern: Soft Deletes**
Never physically delete records - add `deletedAt` timestamp. Allows data recovery, audit compliance, and referential integrity. Filter `WHERE deletedAt IS NULL` in queries.

**Pattern: Polymorphic Associations**
Entity relates to multiple types. Example: Comment can be on Post or Photo. Options: (1) separate foreign keys (commentableType + commentableId), (2) junction tables per type, (3) single table inheritance.

**Pattern: Temporal/Historical Data**
Track changes over time. Options: (1) Effective/expiry dates per record, (2) separate history table, (3) event sourcing (store all changes as events). Choose based on query patterns.

**Pattern: Multi-tenancy**
Isolate data per customer. Options: (1) Separate databases (strong isolation), (2) Shared schema with tenantId column (efficient), (3) Separate schemas in same DB (balance). Add tenantId to all queries if shared.

**Pattern: Hierarchies**
Model trees/nested structures. Options: (1) Adjacency list (parentId), (2) Nested sets (left/right values), (3) Path enumeration (materialized path), (4) Closure table (all ancestor-descendant pairs). Trade-offs between read/write performance.

## Guardrails

**✓ Do:**
- Start with use cases - schema serves queries/operations
- Normalize first, then denormalize for specific performance needs
- Document all constraints and invariants explicitly
- Use meaningful, consistent naming conventions
- Consider future evolution - design for extensibility
- Validate model against ALL required use cases
- Model the real world accurately (don't force fit to technology)

**✗ Don't:**
- Design schema in isolation from use cases
- Premature optimization (denormalize before measuring)
- Skip constraint definitions (leads to data corruption)
- Use generic names (data, value, thing) - be specific
- Ignore cardinality and nullability
- Model implementation details in domain entities
- Forget about data migration path from existing systems
- Create circular dependencies between entities

## Quick Reference

**Resources:**
- `resources/template.md` - Structured process for entity identification, relationship mapping, and constraint definition
- `resources/methodology.md` - Advanced patterns: temporal modeling, graph ontologies, schema evolution, normalization strategies
- `resources/examples/` - Worked examples showing complete schema designs with validation
- `resources/evaluators/rubric_data_schema_knowledge_modeling.json` - Quality assessment before delivery

**When to choose which resource:**
- Simple domain (< 10 entities) → Start with template
- Complex domain or graph/ontology → Study methodology for advanced patterns
- Need to see examples → Review examples folder
- Before delivering to user → Always validate with rubric

**Expected deliverable:**
`data-schema-knowledge-modeling.md` file containing: domain description, complete entity definitions with attributes and types, relationship mappings with cardinality, constraint specifications, diagram (ERD/graph visualization), validation against use cases, and implementation notes.

**Common schema notations:**
- **ERD** (Entity-Relationship Diagram): Visual representation of entities and relationships
- **UML Class Diagram**: Object-oriented view with inheritance and associations
- **Graph Diagram**: Nodes and edges for graph databases
- **JSON Schema**: API/document structure with validation rules
- **SQL DDL**: Executable CREATE TABLE statements
- **Ontology (OWL/RDF)**: Semantic web knowledge representation
