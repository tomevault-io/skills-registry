### What This Skill Does

This skill provides **systematic evaluation tools** for assessing existing designs against cognitive science principles. It gives you repeatable checklists, scoring rubrics, and prioritized fix recommendations.

**Core principle:** Good evaluation is systematic, not subjective — every dimension gets checked, every finding gets severity-classified, every fix gets prioritized.

### Why It Matters

**Common problems this addresses:**
- Design reviews that miss critical issues because they rely on gut feeling
- Teams disagreeing on what to fix first without objective framework
- Usability problems shipping because no one checked systematically
- Visualizations that mislead because integrity was never audited

**How this helps:**
- Covers all cognitive dimensions (visibility, hierarchy, chunking, memory, feedback, consistency, scanning, simplicity)
- Scores visualizations on 4 independent criteria (Clarity, Efficiency, Integrity, Aesthetics)
- Classifies findings by severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Produces actionable fix recommendations with clear priority order

### When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when:**
- ✓ Conducting design reviews or critiques
- ✓ Evaluating designs for cognitive alignment before iteration
- ✓ Quality assurance before launch or publication
- ✓ Diagnosing why a design "feels off"
- ✓ Choosing between design alternatives with objective criteria
- ✓ Auditing data visualizations for quality

**Do NOT use for:**
- ✗ Creating new designs from scratch (use `cognitive-design`)
- ✗ Learning cognitive theory (use `cognitive-design` Path 1)
- ✗ Detecting misleading visualizations (use `cognitive-fallacies-guard`)
- ✗ Technical implementation (coding, tooling)

## Design Review Workflow

**Time:** 30-90 minutes depending on scope

**Copy this checklist and track your progress:**

```
Design Evaluation Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Systematic Assessment
- [ ] Step 2: Visualization Quality Audit (if applicable)
- [ ] Step 3: Severity Classification & Prioritization
- [ ] Step 4: Fix Recommendations
```

### Step 1: Systematic Assessment

Apply the Cognitive Design Checklist across all 8 dimensions: Visibility, Visual Hierarchy, Chunking, Simplicity, Memory Support, Feedback, Consistency, Scanning Patterns. Check every item. Record pass/fail for each dimension with specific evidence.

**Resource:** [Cognitive Design Checklist](resources/cognitive-checklist.md)

### Step 2: Visualization Quality Audit (if applicable)

If the design includes data visualizations, apply the 4-Criteria Visualization Audit. Score each criterion 1-5: Clarity, Efficiency, Integrity, Aesthetics. Calculate average and identify weakest dimension.

**Resource:** [Visualization Audit Framework](resources/visualization-audit.md)

### Step 3: Severity Classification & Prioritization

Classify every finding by severity:
- **CRITICAL:** Integrity violations, accessibility failures, users cannot complete core tasks. Fix immediately.
- **HIGH:** Clarity/efficiency issues preventing use, missing feedback for critical actions, working memory overload (>10 ungrouped items). Fix before launch.
- **MEDIUM:** Suboptimal patterns, aesthetic issues, minor inconsistencies. Fix in next iteration.
- **LOW:** Minor optimizations, polish items. Fix when convenient.

**Priority rule:** Fix foundation-first — perception before coherence, integrity before aesthetics, critical before high.

### Step 4: Fix Recommendations

For each finding, document:
1. **What is wrong** — specific description with evidence
2. **Why it matters** — which cognitive principle is violated
3. **How to fix** — concrete, actionable recommendation
4. **Expected outcome** — what improves after the fix
5. **Effort estimate** — quick fix (minutes), moderate (hours), significant (days)

Verify fixes don't harm other dimensions.

## Path Selection Menu

### Path 1: Run Cognitive Design Checklist

**Choose this when:** Evaluating any interface, layout, content page, form, or general design.

**What you'll get:** Pass/fail across 8 cognitive dimensions, test methods, common failures, severity-classified findings.

**Time:** 20-40 minutes

**→ [Go to Cognitive Design Checklist](resources/cognitive-checklist.md)**

---

### Path 2: Run Visualization Audit

**Choose this when:** Evaluating data visualizations — charts, graphs, dashboards, infographics.

**What you'll get:** 1-5 scores on Clarity, Efficiency, Integrity, Aesthetics with pass/fail threshold.

**Time:** 15-30 minutes per visualization

**→ [Go to Visualization Audit Framework](resources/visualization-audit.md)**

---

### Path 3: Combined Review

**Choose this when:** Comprehensive review covering both interface elements and data visualizations.

**Process:** Run Cognitive Checklist first, then Visualization Audit on each data component, merge findings, produce unified fix list.

**Time:** 45-90 minutes

**→ Start with [Cognitive Checklist](resources/cognitive-checklist.md), then [Visualization Audit](resources/visualization-audit.md)**

## Quick Reference

### 3-Question Rapid Check

**1. Attention** — "Is it obvious what to look at first?"
- If NO: hierarchy and visibility issues

**2. Memory** — "Is the user required to remember anything that could be shown?"
- If NO: memory support and chunking issues

**3. Clarity** — "Can someone unfamiliar understand in 5 seconds?"
- If NO: simplicity and comprehension issues

All YES = likely cognitively sound. Any NO = run full checklist on the failing area.

---

## Guardrails

**This skill does NOT:** Create designs, teach theory, provide domain guidance, replace user testing, or cover full accessibility compliance.

**This skill DOES:** Provide systematic evaluation against cognitive principles, classify findings by severity, produce prioritized fix recommendations, and score visualization quality.
