# GraphRAG System Design

## What Is It?

This skill helps you **design complete GraphRAG systems integrating graph databases, vector stores, orchestration frameworks, and LLM reasoning**. Given a domain and retrieval requirements, it guides you through pattern selection, technology stack decisions, integration pipeline design, and domain-specific customizations.

**The payoff**: GraphRAG systems overcome fundamental limitations of flat vector RAG by adding relational structure for multi-hop reasoning, provenance tracking for explainability, and structured retrieval that preserves semantic context across connected entities.

## Workflow

**COPY THIS CHECKLIST** and work through each step:

```
GraphRAG System Design Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze domain requirements
- [ ] Step 2: Select GraphRAG pattern
- [ ] Step 3: Choose technology stack
- [ ] Step 4: Design integration pipeline
- [ ] Step 5: Apply domain customizations
- [ ] Step 6: Define deployment strategy
- [ ] Step 7: Produce specification
```

**Step 1: Analyze domain requirements**

Characterize the retrieval problem: query complexity (single-hop vs multi-hop), data volume and update frequency, compliance constraints, latency requirements, and explainability needs. Determine whether graph structure adds value over flat retrieval -- multi-hop reasoning, entity disambiguation, and relationship-aware context assembly are strong signals for GraphRAG. Define the user personas and query patterns the system must serve.

**Step 2: Select GraphRAG pattern**

Choose the core retrieval architecture using the [GraphRAG Pattern Selection](#graphrag-pattern-selection) guide. Match your query patterns to the appropriate pattern: Hybrid Symbol-Vector for mixed structured/unstructured queries, Subgraph-on-Demand for focused context assembly, or Community-Based Global Summarization for broad thematic queries. For detailed pattern descriptions, see [Methodology Reference](./resources/methodology.md).

**Step 3: Choose technology stack**

Select components for each architectural layer: graph database, vector database, orchestration framework, and LLM provider. Use the [Technology Stacks Reference](./resources/technology-stacks.md) for component-by-component comparison. Key decisions: single-system vs multi-system hybrid, managed vs self-hosted, framework-based vs custom pipeline. Consider team expertise, budget constraints, and existing infrastructure.

**Step 4: Design integration pipeline**

Define the end-to-end data flow from ingestion through generation. The core pipeline stages: Ingest (raw data) -> Extract (entities and relations) -> Build KG (populate graph) -> Index (vector embeddings + graph indices) -> Retrieve (hybrid graph+vector search) -> Generate (LLM with graph-grounded context) -> Cite (provenance from graph paths). Design the query routing logic that determines when to use graph traversal, vector search, or both. See [Methodology Reference](./resources/methodology.md) for pipeline design considerations.

**Step 5: Apply domain customizations**

Adapt the generic architecture to domain-specific requirements: ontology selection (UMLS for healthcare, FIBO for finance), compliance patterns (HIPAA access control, regulatory audit trails), and domain retrieval patterns (temporal graphs for finance, layered patient graphs for clinical). See [Domain Patterns Reference](./resources/domain-patterns.md) for domain-specific guidance.

**Step 6: Define deployment strategy**

Specify the deployment architecture: graph database sizing and clustering, vector index configuration, caching strategy, batch vs real-time ingestion, monitoring and observability, and scaling plan. Define performance SLAs for query latency, throughput, and freshness. Plan for graph maintenance: incremental updates, schema evolution, and data quality monitoring.

**Step 7: Produce specification**

Compile the complete system design specification using the [Output Template](#output-template). Validate against the quality rubric at [System Design Rubric](./resources/evaluators/rubric_system_design.json). Ensure all components are connected end-to-end with clear data flows, error handling, and fallback strategies.

## GraphRAG Pattern Selection

| Pattern | Query Type | Mechanism | Best For | Trade-offs |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Hybrid Symbol-Vector** | Mixed structured + semantic | Pre-filter by graph type/constraint then rank by embedding similarity; or broad vector search then graph-guided expansion | Systems needing both precise structural queries and fuzzy semantic search; enterprise QA with entity disambiguation | Higher complexity; requires synchronized graph + vector indices; latency depends on filter-then-rank vs expand strategy |
| **Subgraph-on-Demand** | Focused multi-hop | Build temporary query-specific subgraphs rather than querying one monolithic graph; extract relevant neighborhood, embed, retrieve | Real-time applications needing focused context; systems with frequent updates; cost-sensitive deployments | Cold-start latency for subgraph construction; requires efficient subgraph extraction; context may miss distant but relevant nodes |
| **Community-Based Global Summarization** | Broad thematic / global | Detect communities/clusters in graph, embed summaries of each community, retrieve relevant community then drill into entity details; Microsoft GraphRAG pattern | Broad "what is X about?" queries; corpus-level summarization; thematic exploration across large knowledge bases | Requires periodic community detection (batch); summaries may lose detail; community boundaries can split related concepts |

### Choosing a Pattern

- **If queries need both "find entities of type X" and "find semantically similar content"** -> Hybrid Symbol-Vector
- **If queries are focused and context window cost matters** -> Subgraph-on-Demand
- **If queries are broad, thematic, or corpus-spanning** -> Community-Based Global Summarization
- **If requirements span multiple patterns** -> Combine patterns with a query router that dispatches to the appropriate retrieval path

## Integration Architecture

A complete GraphRAG system integrates four core component layers:

```
+------------------+     +------------------+     +----------------------+     +-----------+
|  Graph Database  |     |  Vector Database |     |  Orchestration       |     |    LLM    |
|  (Structure)     |<--->|  (Semantics)     |<--->|  Framework           |<--->| (Reason)  |
|                  |     |                  |     |                      |     |           |
|  Neo4j / Tiger   |     |  Pinecone /      |     |  LangChain /         |     |  GPT-4 /  |
|  Graph / Neptune |     |  Weaviate /      |     |  LlamaIndex /        |     |  Claude / |
|  / GraphDB       |     |  Qdrant / pgvec  |     |  LangGraph / Custom  |     |  Llama   |
+------------------+     +------------------+     +----------------------+     +-----------+
        |                        |                          |
        v                        v                          v
  Graph Traversal          Embedding Search           Pipeline Logic
  Multi-hop Paths          Semantic Ranking           Query Routing
  Schema Filtering         Similarity Scores          Context Assembly
  Provenance Chains        Hybrid Re-ranking          Citation Generation
```

**Key integration decisions:**
- **Graph-first vs text-first pipeline**: Does the query first hit the graph (structured filter) or the vector store (semantic search)?
- **Single-system vs multi-system**: Use Neo4j vector index (single system) or Neo4j + Pinecone (multi-system)?
- **Framework vs custom**: LangChain/LlamaIndex for rapid development, or custom pipeline for maximum control?
- **Synchronization**: How are graph and vector indices kept consistent during updates?
