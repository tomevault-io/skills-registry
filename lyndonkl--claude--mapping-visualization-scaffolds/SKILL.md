## Purpose

Create visual maps that make implicit relationships, dependencies, and structures explicit through diagrams, concept maps, and architectural blueprints.

## When to Use

Use mapping-visualization-scaffolds when you need to:

**System Understanding:**
- Document complex system architectures (microservices, infrastructure, data flows)
- Map component dependencies and relationships
- Visualize API endpoints and integration points
- Understand legacy system structure

**Knowledge Organization:**
- Create concept maps for learning or teaching
- Build taxonomies and hierarchies
- Organize research literature or domain knowledge
- Structure information architecture

**Process & Flow Documentation:**
- Map user journeys and workflows
- Create decision trees and flowcharts
- Document approval chains or escalation paths
- Visualize project dependencies and timelines

**Strategic Visualization:**
- Map stakeholder relationships and influence
- Visualize organizational structures
- Create competitive landscape maps
- Document value chains or business models

## What Is It

A mapping scaffold is a structured approach to creating visual representations that show:
- **Nodes** (components, concepts, people, steps)
- **Relationships** (connections, dependencies, hierarchies, flows)
- **Attributes** (properties, states, metadata)
- **Groupings** (clusters, categories, layers)

**Quick Example:**

For a microservices architecture:
```
Nodes: API Gateway, Auth Service, User Service, Payment Service, Database
Relationships:
  - API Gateway → calls → Auth Service
  - Auth Service → validates → User Service
  - Payment Service → reads/writes → Database
Groupings: Frontend Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Layer
```

This creates a visual map showing how services connect and depend on each other.

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Mapping Visualization Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Clarify mapping purpose
- [ ] Step 2: Identify nodes and relationships
- [ ] Step 3: Choose visualization approach
- [ ] Step 4: Create the map
- [ ] Step 5: Validate and refine
```

**Step 1: Clarify mapping purpose**

Ask user about their goal: What system/concept needs mapping? Who's the audience? What decisions will this inform? What level of detail is needed? See [Common Patterns](#common-patterns) for typical use cases.

**Step 2: Identify nodes and relationships**

List all key elements (nodes) and their connections (relationships). Identify hierarchy levels, dependency types, and grouping criteria. For simple cases (< 20 nodes), use [resources/template.md](resources/template.md). For complex systems (50+ nodes) or collaborative sessions, see [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md) for advanced strategies.

**Step 3: Choose visualization approach**

Select format based on complexity: Simple lists for < 10 nodes, tree diagrams for hierarchies, network graphs for complex relationships, or layered diagrams for systems. For large-scale systems or multi-map hierarchies, consult [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md) for mapping strategies and tool selection. See [Common Patterns](#common-patterns) for guidance.

**Step 4: Create the map**

Build the visualization using markdown, ASCII diagrams, or structured text. Start with high-level structure, then add details. Include legend if needed. Use [resources/template.md](resources/template.md) as your scaffold.

**Step 5: Validate and refine**

Check completeness, clarity, and accuracy using [resources/evaluators/rubric_mapping_visualization_scaffolds.json](resources/evaluators/rubric_mapping_visualization_scaffolds.json). Ensure all critical nodes and relationships are present. Minimum standard: Score ≥ 3.5 average.

## Common Patterns

**Architecture Diagrams:**
- System components as nodes
- Service calls/data flows as relationships
- Layers as groupings (frontend, backend, data)
- Use for: Technical documentation, system design reviews

**Concept Maps:**
- Concepts/ideas as nodes
- "is-a", "has-a", "leads-to" as relationships
- Themes as groupings
- Use for: Learning, knowledge organization, research synthesis

**Dependency Graphs:**
- Tasks/features/modules as nodes
- "depends-on", "blocks", "requires" as relationships
- Phases/sprints as groupings
- Use for: Project planning, risk assessment, parallel work identification

**Hierarchies & Taxonomies:**
- Categories/classes as nodes
- Parent-child relationships
- Levels as groupings (L1, L2, L3)
- Use for: Information architecture, org charts, skill trees

**Flow Diagrams:**
- Steps/states as nodes
- Transitions/decisions as relationships
- Swim lanes as groupings (roles, systems)
- Use for: Process documentation, user journeys, decision trees

## Guardrails

**Scope Management:**
- Focus on relationships that matter for the specific purpose
- Don't map everything—map what's decision-relevant
- Stop at appropriate detail level (usually 3-4 layers deep)
- For systems with > 50 nodes, create multiple focused maps

**Clarity Over Completeness:**
- Prioritize understandability over exhaustiveness
- Use consistent notation and naming
- Add legend if > 3 relationship types
- Group related nodes to reduce visual complexity

**Validation:**
- Verify accuracy with subject matter experts
- Test if someone unfamiliar can understand the map
- Check for missing critical relationships
- Ensure directionality is clear (A → B vs A ← B)

**Common Pitfalls:**
- ❌ Creating "hairball" diagrams with too many connections
- ❌ Mixing abstraction levels (strategic + implementation details)
- ❌ Using inconsistent node/relationship representations
- ❌ Forgetting to state the map's purpose and scope

## Quick Reference

**Resources:**
- `resources/template.md` - Structured scaffold for creating maps
- `resources/evaluators/rubric_mapping_visualization_scaffolds.json` - Quality criteria

**Output:**
- File: `mapping-visualization-scaffolds.md` in current directory
- Contains: Nodes, relationships, groupings, legend (if needed)
- Format: Markdown with ASCII diagrams or structured lists

**Success Criteria:**
- All critical nodes identified
- Relationships clearly labeled with directionality
- Appropriate grouping/layering applied
- Understandable by target audience without explanation
- Validated against quality rubric (score ≥ 3.5)
