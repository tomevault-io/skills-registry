## Purpose

Proactively identify, assess, prioritize, and monitor project risks to reduce likelihood of surprises, enable informed decision-making, and ensure stakeholders understand uncertainty. Transform vague concerns ("this might not work") into actionable risk management (probability×impact scores, named owners, specific mitigations, measurable triggers).

## When to Use

**Use this skill when:**

- **Project kickoff**: Establishing risk baseline before significant work begins
- **High uncertainty**: New technology, unfamiliar domain, complex dependencies, regulatory constraints
- **Stakeholder pressure**: Execs/board want visibility into "what could go wrong"
- **Critical path concerns**: Delays, dependencies, or single points of failure threaten timeline
- **Gate reviews**: Quarterly check-ins, milestone reviews, go/no-go decisions require risk assessment
- **Incident response**: Major issue occurred, need to identify related risks to prevent recurrence
- **Portfolio management**: Comparing risk profiles across multiple projects for resource allocation
- **Change requests**: Scope/timeline/budget changes require risk re-assessment

**Common triggers:**
- "What are the biggest risks to this project?"
- "What could cause us to miss the deadline?"
- "How confident are we in this estimate/plan?"
- "What's our backup plan if X fails?"
- "What dependencies could block us?"

## What Is It?

**Project Risk Register** is a living document tracking all identified risks with:

1. **Risk identification**: What could go wrong (threat) or go better than expected (opportunity)
2. **Risk assessment**: Probability (how likely?) × Impact (how bad/good if it happens?) = Risk Score
3. **Risk prioritization**: Focus on high-score risks (red/high) first, monitor medium (yellow), accept low (green)
4. **Risk ownership**: Named individual responsible for monitoring and mitigation
5. **Risk response**: Mitigation (reduce probability), contingency (reduce impact if occurs), acceptance (do nothing)
6. **Risk triggers**: Early warning indicators that risk is materializing (time to activate contingency)
7. **Risk monitoring**: Regular updates (status changes, new risks, retired risks)

**Risk Matrix (5×5 Probability×Impact):**

```
Impact →     1         2         3         4         5
Prob ↓    Minimal   Minor   Moderate  Major   Severe

5 High   │ Medium │ Medium │  High  │  High  │ Critical│
         │   5    │   10   │   15   │   20   │   25    │
4        │  Low   │ Medium │ Medium │  High  │  High   │
         │   4    │    8   │   12   │   16   │   20    │
3 Medium │  Low   │  Low   │ Medium │ Medium │  High   │
         │   3    │    6   │    9   │   12   │   15    │
2        │  Low   │  Low   │  Low   │ Medium │ Medium  │
         │   2    │    4   │    6   │    8   │   10    │
1 Low    │  Low   │  Low   │  Low   │  Low   │ Medium  │
         │   1    │    2   │    3   │    4   │    5    │
```

**Risk Thresholds:**
- **Critical (≥20)**: Escalate to exec, immediate mitigation required
- **High (12-19)**: Active management, weekly review, documented mitigation
- **Medium (6-11)**: Monitor closely, monthly review, contingency plan
- **Low (1-5)**: Accept or minimal mitigation, quarterly review

**Example: Software Migration Project**

| Risk ID | Risk | Prob | Impact | Score | Owner | Mitigation | Contingency |
|---------|------|------|--------|-------|-------|------------|-------------|
| R-001 | Third-party API deprecated mid-project | 3 | 4 | **12 (Medium)** | Eng Lead | Contact vendor for deprecation timeline | Build abstraction layer for quick swap |
| R-002 | Key engineer leaves during critical phase | 2 | 5 | **10 (Medium)** | EM | Knowledge sharing, pair programming | Contract backup engineer |
| R-003 | Data migration takes 3× longer than estimated | 4 | 4 | **16 (High)** | Data Lead | Pilot migration on 10% data first | Extend timeline, reduce scope |

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Risk Register Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Identify risks across categories
- [ ] Step 2: Assess probability and impact
- [ ] Step 3: Calculate risk scores and prioritize
- [ ] Step 4: Assign owners and define responses
- [ ] Step 5: Monitor and update regularly
```

**Step 1: Identify risks across categories**

Brainstorm what could go wrong using structured categories (technical, schedule, resource, external, scope). See [Common Patterns](#common-patterns) for category checklists. Use [resources/template.md](resources/template.md) for register structure.

**Step 2: Assess probability and impact**

Score each risk on probability (1-5: rare to almost certain) and impact (1-5: minimal to severe). Involve subject matter experts for accuracy. See [Risk Scoring Framework](#risk-scoring-framework) for definitions.

**Step 3: Calculate risk scores and prioritize**

Multiply Probability × Impact for each risk. Plot on risk matrix (5×5 grid) to visualize risk profile. Focus mitigation on Critical/High risks first. See [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md) for advanced techniques like Monte Carlo simulation.

**Step 4: Assign owners and define responses**

For each High/Critical risk, assign named owner (not "team"), define mitigation (reduce probability), contingency (reduce impact), and triggers (when to activate contingency). See [resources/template.md](resources/template.md) for response planning structure.

**Step 5: Monitor and update regularly**

Review risk register weekly (active projects) or monthly (longer projects). Update probabilities/impacts as context changes, add new risks, retire closed risks, track mitigation progress. See [Guardrails](#guardrails) for monitoring cadence.

## Common Patterns

**Risk categories (use for brainstorming):**

- **Technical risks**: Technology failure, integration issues, performance problems, security vulnerabilities, technical debt, complexity underestimated
- **Schedule risks**: Dependencies delayed, estimation errors, scope creep, resource unavailability, critical path blocked
- **Resource risks**: Key person leaves, skill gaps, budget overrun, vendor/contractor issues, equipment unavailable
- **External risks**: Regulatory changes, market shifts, competitor actions, economic downturn, natural disasters, vendor bankruptcy
- **Scope risks**: Unclear requirements, changing priorities, stakeholder disagreement, gold-plating, mission creep
- **Organizational risks**: Lack of executive support, competing priorities, insufficient funding, organizational change, political conflicts

**By project type:**

- **Software projects**: Third-party API changes, dependency vulnerabilities, cloud provider outages, data migration issues, browser compatibility, scaling problems, security breaches
- **Construction projects**: Weather delays, material shortages, permit issues, labor strikes, soil conditions, cost overruns, safety incidents
- **Product launches**: Manufacturing delays, supply chain disruption, competitor launch, pricing miscalculation, market demand lower than expected, quality issues
- **Organizational change**: Employee resistance, communication breakdown, training inadequate, budget cuts, leadership turnover, cultural misalignment

**By risk response type:**

- **Mitigate (reduce probability)**: Training, prototyping, process improvements, redundancy, quality checks, early testing
- **Contingency (reduce impact if occurs)**: Backup plans, insurance, reserves (time/budget), alternative suppliers, rollback procedures
- **Accept (do nothing)**: Low-score risks not worth mitigation cost, residual risks after mitigation
- **Transfer (shift to others)**: Insurance, outsourcing, contracts (penalty clauses), warranties

**Typical risk profile evolution:**
- **Project start**: Many medium risks (uncertainty high), few critical (pre-mitigation)
- **Mid-project**: Critical risks mitigated to medium/low, new risks emerge (dependencies, integration)
- **Near completion**: Low risks dominate (most issues resolved), few high (last-minute surprises)
- **Red flag**: Risk score increasing over time (mitigation not working, new issues emerging faster than resolution)

## Risk Scoring Framework

**Probability Scale (1-5):**
- **5 - Almost Certain (>80%)**: Expected to occur, historical data confirms, no mitigation in place
- **4 - Likely (60-80%)**: Probably will occur, similar projects had this issue, weak mitigation
- **3 - Possible (40-60%)**: May or may not occur, depends on circumstances, some mitigation in place
- **2 - Unlikely (20-40%)**: Probably won't occur, mitigation in place, low historical precedent
- **1 - Rare (<20%)**: Very unlikely, strong mitigation, no historical precedent

**Impact Scale (1-5) - adjust dimensions for project context:**

**For Schedule Impact:**
- **5 - Severe**: >20% delay (e.g., 3-month project delayed 3+ weeks), miss critical deadline, cascading delays
- **4 - Major**: 10-20% delay, miss milestone, affects dependent projects
- **3 - Moderate**: 5-10% delay, timeline buffer consumed, no external impact
- **2 - Minor**: <5% delay, absorbed within sprint/phase, minor schedule pressure
- **1 - Minimal**: <1% delay or no delay, negligible schedule impact

**For Budget Impact:**
- **5 - Severe**: >20% budget overrun, requires new funding approval, project viability threatened
- **4 - Major**: 10-20% overrun, contingency exhausted, scope cuts required
- **3 - Moderate**: 5-10% overrun, contingency partially used, no scope cuts
- **2 - Minor**: <5% overrun, absorbed within budget flexibility
- **1 - Minimal**: <1% overrun or no budget impact

**For Scope/Quality Impact:**
- **5 - Severe**: Core functionality lost, customer-facing quality issue, regulatory violation
- **4 - Major**: Important feature cut, significant quality degradation, customer complaints
- **3 - Moderate**: Nice-to-have feature cut, minor quality issue, internal workarounds needed
- **2 - Minor**: Edge case feature cut, cosmetic quality issue
- **1 - Minimal**: No scope or quality impact

**Composite Impact** (when multiple dimensions affected):
- Use **maximum** of any single dimension (pessimistic, conservative)
- OR use **weighted average**: Schedule 40%, Budget 30%, Scope/Quality 30%

**Example Scoring:**

Risk: "Key engineer leaves mid-project"
- Probability: 2 (Unlikely - 20% based on tenure, satisfaction, retention rate)
- Impact Schedule: 4 (Major - 3-week delay to onboard replacement, knowledge transfer)
- Impact Budget: 2 (Minor - recruiter fees, some overtime)
- Impact Scope: 3 (Moderate - may cut advanced features)
- **Composite Impact**: 4 (take maximum: schedule impact is worst)
- **Risk Score**: 2 × 4 = **8 (Medium)**

## Guardrails

**Ensure quality:**

1. **Identify risks proactively, not reactively**: Run risk workshops before problems occur
   - ✓ Brainstorm risks at project kickoff, use checklists (technical, schedule, resource, etc.)
   - ❌ Add risks only after incidents occur (reactive)

2. **Be specific, not vague**: "Integration fails" is vague, "Vendor API rate limits block migration" is specific
   - ✓ "Third-party payment gateway rejects 10% of transactions due to fraud rules"
   - ❌ "Payment issues"

3. **Separate probability and impact**: Don't conflate "bad if it happens" with "likely to happen"
   - ✓ Asteroid hits office: Prob=1 (rare), Impact=5 (severe), Score=5 (low priority)
   - ❌ Conflating: "This is really bad so it must be high priority" (ignoring low probability)

4. **Assign named owners, not teams**: "Engineering team" is not accountable, "Sarah (Tech Lead)" is
   - ✓ Owner: Sarah (Tech Lead), responsible for monitoring and activating contingency
   - ❌ Owner: Engineering Team (diffused responsibility)

5. **Define mitigation AND contingency**: Mitigation reduces probability, contingency handles if it occurs anyway
   - ✓ Mitigation: Prototype integration early (reduce prob). Contingency: Build abstraction layer for quick swap (reduce impact)
   - ❌ Only mitigation, no backup plan

6. **Update regularly**: Stale risk register is worse than none (false confidence)
   - ✓ Weekly review for active projects (High/Critical risks), monthly for longer projects
   - ❌ Create register at kickoff, never update (probabilities/impacts change as project progresses)

7. **Retire closed risks**: Don't let register grow indefinitely, archive mitigated/irrelevant risks
   - ✓ Mark risk "Closed" with resolution date, move to archive section
   - ❌ Keep all risks forever (signal-to-noise ratio degrades)

8. **Escalate critical risks immediately**: Don't wait for weekly meeting if Critical risk emerges
   - ✓ Prob=5 Impact=5 Score=25 → Escalate to exec same day, emergency mitigation
   - ❌ Wait for scheduled review (risk could materialize)

## Quick Reference

**Resources:**
- **Quick start**: [resources/template.md](resources/template.md) - Risk register template with scoring table, response planning, monitoring log
- **Advanced techniques**: [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md) - Monte Carlo simulation, decision trees, sensitivity analysis, risk aggregation, earned value management
- **Quality check**: [resources/evaluators/rubric_project_risk_register.json](resources/evaluators/rubric_project_risk_register.json) - Evaluation criteria

**Success criteria:**
- ✓ Identified 15-30 risks across all categories (technical, schedule, resource, external, scope, org)
- ✓ All High/Critical risks (score ≥12) have named owners, mitigation plans, and contingencies
- ✓ Risk scores differentiated (not all scored 6-9; use full 1-25 range)
- ✓ Mitigation and contingency plans are specific and actionable (not "monitor closely")
- ✓ Triggers defined for when to activate contingencies (quantifiable thresholds)
- ✓ Register updated regularly (weekly for active projects, monthly for longer projects)
- ✓ Risk profile matches project phase (high uncertainty at start, decreasing over time)

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Too few risks identified (<10) → incomplete risk picture, false confidence
- ❌ All risks scored medium (6-9) → not differentiated, unclear prioritization
- ❌ Vague risks ("things might not work") → not actionable
- ❌ No risk owners assigned → diffused accountability, mitigation doesn't happen
- ❌ Mitigation without contingency → no backup plan if mitigation fails
- ❌ Created once, never updated → stale data, risks evolve
- ❌ Only negative risks (threats) → missing opportunities (positive risks)
- ❌ Risk register separate from project plan → not integrated into workflow

**When to use alternatives:**
- **Pre-mortem**: When project hasn't started, want to imagine failure scenarios (complements risk register)
- **FMEA (Failure Mode Effects Analysis)**: Manufacturing/engineering projects needing detailed failure analysis
- **Monte Carlo simulation**: When need probabilistic timeline/budget forecasting (use methodology.md)
- **Decision tree**: When risks involve sequential decisions with branch points
- **Scenario planning**: When risks are strategic/long-term (market shifts, competitor actions)
