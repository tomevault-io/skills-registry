name: validated-knowledge-synthesis
description: Transform raw, unorganized information into actionable knowledge through systematic validation. Use when users want to synthesize information from multiple sources (documents, URLs, transcripts, notes) into structured knowledge documents. Supports three document types - curated context (default, optimized for recall), guidance (implementation-focused narrative), and reference (quick lookup). Combines convergent synthesis with tension preservation to maintain productive contradictions. Triggers on requests like "synthesize this information", "create knowledge document from these sources", "transform these notes into actionable guidance", or "help me organize this research". Use when this capability is needed.

# Validated Knowledge Synthesis (VKS)

Transform raw information into validated, actionable knowledge while preserving productive tensions.

## Parameters

Acquire all required parameters upfront in a single prompt:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| source_materials | Yes | Raw sources (direct text, file paths, URLs) |
| synthesis_topic | Yes | Subject being synthesized |
| target_audience | Yes | Intended users of the knowledge |
| document_type | No | "curated context" (default), "guidance", or "reference" |
| output_location | No | File path to save output |

Support multiple input methods: direct text, file paths, URLs, or other user-preferred methods.

## Workflow

### 1. Source Validation

Assess each source for:
- Authority and credibility
- Recency and relevance
- Internal consistency
- Citation quality

Create a source validation matrix. Flag sources lacking sufficient validation.

### 2. Pattern Recognition

Identify across sources:
- Common themes and shared insights
- Contradictory claims or competing frameworks
- Gaps where sources don't address key aspects
- Overlapping evidence strengthening claims

Categorize relationships as **convergent** (ideas strengthen each other) or **tension-based** (separation maintains value).

### 3. Synthesis Strategy Selection

**Apply convergence when:**
- Ideas are complementary
- Contradictions resolve at higher abstraction
- Unified approach improves application
- No valuable knowledge lost in combination

**Apply tension preservation when:**
- Contradictions generate new insights
- Different contexts require different approaches
- Forced convergence would flatten valuable complexity

### 4. Document Type Execution

See [references/document-types.md](references/document-types.md) for detailed format specifications.

**Curated Context** (default): Hybrid of guidance and reference. Clear sections distinguishing each. Optimized for ease of recall.

**Guidance**: Narrative flow, problem-solution-implementation arc, 200+ words continuous prose before formatting, bullet points only for final checklists.

**Reference**: Quick lookup, categorical organization, bullet-friendly, designed for scanning.

### 5. Writing Execution

Apply these principles to all documents. See [references/writing-principles.md](references/writing-principles.md) for details.

- **Reader Empathy**: Communicate key ideas in minimal words. Core tenet: "Learning how to communicate something in 30 seconds that takes most people 5 minutes is a HUGE unlock."
- **Short Sentences**: Simple sentences build patience for complex concepts.
- **Strong Verbs**: Use precise verbs. Avoid helpers (has, had), infinitives when direct verbs work, "to be" variations.
- **Simple Words**: Choose simpler words (use not utilize, help not facilitate).

### 6. Apply Frameworks

See [references/frameworks.md](references/frameworks.md) for complete framework details.

**Golden Path Criteria**: Purpose & Audience, Clear & Concise, Structure & Logic, Evidence & Impact, Action & Execution.

**Answer-Explain-Educate**: Lead with direct answer, support with key details, add important context.

**What-So What-Now What**: Present facts, analyze consequences, propose recommendation.

### 7. Validation

Verify:
- Logical progression (premises support conclusions, no circular reasoning)
- Narrative coherence (reader can follow logic without headers)
- Flow validation (paragraphs connect logically)
- Comprehension test (audience can understand and implement)

### 8. Output Generation

Create synthesis document including:
- Executive summary with key insights
- Source validation matrix
- Synthesis strategy decisions with rationale
- Convergent knowledge with evidence
- Preserved tensions with context boundaries
- Implementation guidance

Save to output_location if specified.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Forced convergence weakens knowledge | Apply tension preservation instead |
| Validation failures | Revisit synthesis strategy; clarify context boundaries |
| Low-quality sources | Exclude or document limitations clearly |
| Excessive complexity | Create layered documentation (summary, analysis, appendices) |
| Fragmented narrative | Add transitions, embed lists in prose, test without formatting |
