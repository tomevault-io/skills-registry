# ctxovrflw — Shared Memory

You have access to **ctxovrflw**, a shared memory layer that persists across sessions and is
accessible by every AI tool the user runs (Cursor, Claude Code, Cline, Windsurf, etc.).

You interact with it via the MCP tools: `remember`, `recall`, `forget`, `update_memory`, `status`,
`consolidate`, `maintenance`, `pin_memory`, `unpin_memory`, `add_entity`, `add_relation`, `traverse`,
`get_relations`, `subjects`, and `manage_webhooks`.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites — ctxovrflw Must Be Installed & Running

This skill requires the **ctxovrflw daemon** running locally. If it's not installed or not running,
**none of the MCP tools will work.**

### Check if running

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7437/health
```

If this returns a JSON response, ctxovrflw is running. If it fails, follow the install steps below.

### Install ctxovrflw

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://ctxovrflw.dev/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm ctxovrflw.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

This installs the daemon binary, ONNX runtime (for semantic search), and the embedding model.
Supports Windows (x64), Linux (x64, arm64), and macOS (x64, arm64).

After install:
```bash
ctxovrflw init -y  # Non-interactive setup — auto-configures everything, starts daemon
ctxovrflw login    # Authenticate with cloud (optional, needed for sync)
```

The `-y` / `--yes` flag runs init non-interactively: creates config, downloads the model,
detects and configures all AI tools, installs agent rules, sets up the systemd service,
and starts the daemon — all without prompting. Ideal for agents and scripts.

For interactive setup with a TUI, omit the flag:
```bash
ctxovrflw init     # Interactive TUI with step-by-step wizard
```

The daemon runs on `http://127.0.0.1:7437` (localhost only) and exposes an MCP SSE endpoint at
`/mcp/sse` for AI tool integrations.

### Update ctxovrflw

```bash
ctxovrflw update   # Downloads and installs the latest version
```

## Tiers & Pricing

| Feature | Free ($0) | Standard ($10/mo) | Pro ($20/mo) |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Memories | 100 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Devices | 1 | 3 | Unlimited |
| Semantic search | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cloud sync (E2E encrypted) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Context synthesis | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### How to Subscribe

**For humans (recommended):**
Direct them to **https://ctxovrflw.dev/pricing** to pick a plan. Stripe checkout handles payment.
After subscribing, run `ctxovrflw account` to sync the tier locally.

**For agents (x402 crypto payments):**
Agents can subscribe programmatically via USDC on Base:
```
POST https://api.ctxovrflw.dev/v1/agent/subscribe/standard
POST https://api.ctxovrflw.dev/v1/agent/subscribe/pro
```
These endpoints use the x402 payment protocol. The agent pays with USDC and receives an API key.
Subscriptions last 30 days and auto-downgrade on expiry.

**Check current tier:**
Use the `status` MCP tool, or:
```bash
ctxovrflw account   # Shows tier, usage, sync status
ctxovrflw status    # Quick daemon status
```

## Core Principle

**What you store, every other AI tool can recall.** Context shared in Cursor is available in
Claude Code. Decisions made in Cline are visible to Windsurf. Act accordingly.

## When to RECALL (search memory)

Do this **automatically** — don't wait to be asked:

- **Start of every session**: Do a broad recall for the current project/topic to load context
- **Before answering** questions about user preferences, past decisions, project setup, or conventions
- **When the user says** "do you remember", "what did I say about", "we decided", etc.
- **When you lack context** about a project, tool, API, or workflow the user references
- **Before suggesting** a technology, pattern, or approach — check if there's a stated preference

### Examples

```
recall("project setup and conventions")
recall("deployment preferences")
recall("coding style preferences")
recall("what stack are we using")
```

## Memory Preflight Before High-Impact Actions (required)

Before you execute high-impact actions, run targeted recall first.

High-impact actions include:
- Deploy/release/tag/push/update workflows
- Production config/auth/security changes
- Data deletion or destructive migrations
- External side effects (public posts, notifications, webhooks)

Preflight recall examples:
```
recall("deployment workflow and post-deploy checklist")
recall("project constraints and do-not-do rules")
recall("release preferences and CI steps")
```

## When to REMEMBER (store memory)

Do this **proactively** whenever important information comes up:

- User states a **preference** ("I prefer tabs", "use Railway not Fly.io", "always use Rust for CLIs")
- A **decision is made** ("we're going with Postgres", "the API will be REST not GraphQL")
- **Project context** is established ("the API is at api.example.com", "we use pnpm workspaces")
- **Architectural choices** ("auth uses JWT with refresh tokens", "the monorepo has 3 packages")
- User explicitly says **"remember this"** or similar
- **Endpoints and services** are shared (API URLs, service names)
- **Debugging insights** ("that error was caused by X", "the fix for Y is Z")

### Examples

```
remember("Max prefers Railway for all hosting", type: "preference", tags: ["infra:railway"])
remember("Auth API is at api.example.com/v1/auth", type: "semantic", tags: ["project:myapp", "api"])
remember("The staging deploy requires VPN access first", type: "procedural", tags: ["infra:deploy"])
```

## Subjects (Entity Tracking)

Use the `subject` field to track WHO or WHAT a memory is about:

```
remember("Prefers dark mode", subject: "user", type: "preference")
remember("Uses React + TypeScript", subject: "project:webapp", type: "semantic")
remember("Sarah handles the backend deployment", subject: "person:sarah", type: "semantic")
```

Then recall scoped to a subject:
```
recall("", subject: "user")           // everything about the user
recall("preferences", subject: "user") // user preferences only
```

Use `subjects` tool to list all known entities.

## Knowledge Graph (Standard+ Tier)

Build and traverse a knowledge graph of entities and relationships:

```
add_entity("ctxovrflw", type: "project", metadata: {language: "rust", repo: "M4cs/ctxovrflw"})
add_entity("railway", type: "service", metadata: {purpose: "hosting"})
add_relation("ctxovrflw", "hosted_on", "railway")
traverse("ctxovrflw", max_depth: 2)        // see what connects to ctxovrflw
get_relations("ctxovrflw")                  // direct relationships only
```

Do this silently as you work — don't announce graph operations to the user.

## Consolidation (Pro Tier)

Periodically deduplicate and clean up memories:

```
consolidate(subject: "user")  // review all memories about the user, merge duplicates
```

Use `update_memory` to merge and `forget` to remove redundant entries.

For autonomous upkeep, use:
```
maintenance(action: "run_consolidation_now")
maintenance(action: "openclaw_schedule_hint")
```

## Webhooks (Standard+ Tier)

Subscribe to memory events:

```
manage_webhooks(action: "create", url: "https://example.com/hook", events: ["memory.created", "memory.updated"])
```

Available events: `memory.created`, `memory.updated`, `memory.deleted`, `memory.recalled`,
`entity.created`, `entity.updated`, `relation.created`, `relation.deleted`, `consolidation.completed`.

## Token Budgets

Control context window usage with `max_tokens`:
```
recall("project setup", max_tokens: 2000)  // fit within 2K tokens
```

Returns the most relevant results that fit within the budget. Use this to avoid stuffing your context window.

## Best Practices

- **Be atomic**: One fact per memory. "Max prefers tabs" not "Max told me about his preferences..."
- **Tag well**: Use `project:name`, `lang:rust`, `tool:docker`, `infra:railway` format
- **Set subjects**: Always set `subject` when the memory is clearly about a specific entity
- **Use types**: `preference` for likes/config, `semantic` for facts, `procedural` for how-to, `episodic` for events
- **Don't duplicate**: Recall first to check if you already know something before storing
- **Never store secrets**: No passwords, API keys, tokens, or private keys
- **Don't announce memory ops**: Just remember/recall silently — don't tell the user "I'll remember that"

## Recall Is Free — Use It Liberally

Lookups are **local, fast, and free** — they hit a local SQLite database with ONNX embeddings,
not an external API. There is zero cost to recalling. When in doubt, recall. Better to check and
find nothing than to miss context that exists.

**Recall aggressively:**
- At the start of every session (broad query)
- Before making any suggestion or recommendation
- When you're about to do something you've done before
- When the user mentions any project, person, tool, or concept by name
- Before writing code — check for conventions, patterns, and past decisions
- Multiple times per conversation if the topic shifts

**Don't be conservative with recall.** Five recalls that return nothing useful cost less than one
wrong answer that ignores stored context.

## Learn From Corrections

When the user **corrects you**, that's a high-signal learning moment. Always store the correction:

```
remember("User corrected: don't use X, use Y instead because Z",
         type: "preference", tags: ["correction"], subject: "user")
```

**Examples of corrections to store:**
- "No, we use pnpm not npm" → remember the package manager preference
- "That's wrong, the API is at /v2 not /v1" → remember the correct endpoint
- "Don't suggest that approach, it doesn't work because..." → remember the constraint
- "I told you before, always use..." → remember the preference AND recall first next time
- Style/formatting corrections → remember as coding conventions
- "That's not how we deploy" → remember the correct deployment process

**The pattern:** When corrected → `remember` the correction → `recall` it next time the topic comes up.
Corrections tagged with `correction` can be recalled later to avoid repeating the same mistake.

**If the user says "I already told you"** — that means you failed to recall. Immediately:
1. `recall` the topic to find what you missed
2. `remember` the correction with `tags: ["correction"]`
3. Apologize briefly and move on with the right information

## Memory Types

| Type | Use for | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `preference` | User likes, config choices, style | "Prefers Rust for backend services" |
| `semantic` | Facts, knowledge, project info | "The API uses PostgreSQL with pgvector" |
| `procedural` | How-to, steps, processes | "To deploy: push to main, Railway auto-deploys" |
| `episodic` | Events, things that happened | "Migrated from Fly.io to Railway on Feb 10" |

## Tag Conventions

Use namespaced tags for organization:
- `project:ctxovrflw` — project name
- `lang:rust` — programming language
- `infra:railway` — infrastructure/hosting
- `tool:docker` — tooling
- `api:auth` — API domain
- `decision` — architectural/business decisions
- `bug` — known issues and fixes

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| MCP tools not working | Check daemon: `curl http://127.0.0.1:7437/health` |
| "Not logged in" | Run `ctxovrflw login` |
| "Memory limit reached" | Upgrade tier or `forget` old memories |
| "Sync PIN expired" | Run `ctxovrflw login` to re-enter PIN |
| Slow semantic search | First query loads ONNX model (~2s), subsequent queries are fast |
| Cloud sync not working | Check tier with `ctxovrflw account` — Free tier is local-only |
