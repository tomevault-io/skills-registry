# Mission

Enforce professional Rust usage for systems, services, CLIs, WASM, and performance-sensitive modules: ownership and lifetime discipline, `Result`-based error modeling, justified trait abstractions, explicit async-runtime choice, documented `unsafe` invariants, concurrency safety, and zero-cost abstractions backed by measurement. Reject `Box<dyn Trait>` hierarchies that mimic Java; reject `unwrap()` in library code; reject `unsafe` without a written safety contract.

# Tooling Baseline (Rust)

Treat tool versions as project policy inputs, not permanent recommendations. If a Rust toolchain, edition, MSRV, scanner, or async runtime rule is EOL, superseded, unsupported, or conflicts with the target project's approved platform policy, record the project rule and update this capability before relying on it for new product work.

- **Toolchain**: stable Rust on the release cadence approved by the project. Pin via `rust-toolchain.toml`; declare an **MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)** in `Cargo.toml` (`rust-version = "..."`) for libraries; choose edition 2021 or 2024 deliberately and document migration constraints.
- **Format**: `rustfmt` with project `rustfmt.toml` (or defaults); CI runs `cargo fmt -- --check`.
- **Lint**: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` in CI, with `clippy::pedantic` enabled for new code (`#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]`) and selective allows justified inline.
- **Vulnerability scan**: `cargo audit` in CI; `cargo deny check` for license + bans + advisories.
- **Documentation lint**: `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps`; `#![warn(missing_docs)]` on public APIs of libraries.
- **`unsafe` audit**: `cargo geiger` to surface unsafe usage; `miri` (`cargo +nightly miri test`) for unsafe / FFI test coverage.
- **Test framework**: stdlib `#[test]` + `cargo test --all-features`; `proptest` or `quickcheck` for property tests; `cargo-fuzz` (libFuzzer) or `afl.rs` for fuzz harnesses on parsers / deserializers; `criterion` for benchmarks.
- **Concurrency model checking**: `loom` for testing concurrent primitives across schedule permutations.
- **Async runtime**: `tokio` ≥ 1.38 is the default for services (broadest ecosystem). `async-std` and `smol` only with explicit justification. Mixing runtimes is rejected.
- **Error handling**: `thiserror` for library error enums; `anyhow` for binaries / application code. **Not** both in the same crate without a clear boundary.
- **CI**: `cargo build --locked`, `cargo test --locked`, `cargo clippy --locked`, `cargo audit`, `cargo deny check`.

# When To Use

Use when Rust code is added, reviewed, refactored, or selected for a system / service / CLI / WASM / embedded / performance-sensitive component. Use whenever `unsafe`, `async`, FFI (`extern "C"`), a new trait, or a major Cargo dependency change is introduced.

# Do Not Use When

Do not use to teach Rust syntax. Do not use to introduce Rust solely because of safety appeal — require named team ownership, hiring plan, and ecosystem fit for the target domain.

# Stage Fit

Use during Rust implementation planning, coding, bug-fix, code-review, refactoring, testing, and release-readiness review. Per-stage focus:

- **coding**: ownership/borrowing, `Result`/`?` error model, justified `unsafe` boundary, trait design, async runtime choice.
- **debugging-diagnosis**: lifetime/borrow errors, `panic`/`unwrap` paths, async deadlock, `Send`/`Sync` violation.
- **code-review**: unjustified `unsafe`, `clone()` overuse, premature trait abstraction, error-type erosion.
- **refactoring**: module/visibility boundary, public trait/type compatibility, lifetime simplification.
- **testing**: unit and `#[should_panic]`, property tests, `miri` or sanitizer for `unsafe`.

# Mode Matrix

| Mode | Trigger signals | Professional focus | Required evidence | Companion capabilities | Skip by default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ownership and error boundary | Borrow checker workaround, `.clone()` spread, `unwrap`, `panic!`, `Box<dyn Error>`, library API. | Preserve ownership clarity and typed recoverable errors without hiding failure behavior. | Ownership map, clone-cost decision, typed error boundary, panic audit, tests. | `failure-contract-design`, `code-review` | Teaching syntax or style-only review. |
| Unsafe, FFI, and layout | `unsafe`, `extern "C"`, `repr(C)`, raw pointer, custom allocator, `Pin`, `no_std`. | Document invariants and keep safe wrappers, ABI, panic, and aliasing rules explicit. | `// SAFETY:` contract, FFI layout, panic boundary, Miri/fuzz/unsafe audit. | `low-level-systems-extension`, `security-privacy-gate` | Trusting compiler success as safety proof. |
| Async and concurrency | Tokio task, runtime attribute, `Send`/`Sync`, `Arc<Mutex>`, channel, atomics, lock across await. | Keep runtime singular, cancellation-aware, deadlock-resistant, and scheduler-safe. | Runtime choice, lock/await audit, loom or stress evidence, blocking-call scan. | `concurrency-control`, `reliability-observability-gate` | Sequential tests as concurrency proof. |
| Trait/API and dependency | New trait, public type, feature flag, workspace crate, new dependency, generated client. | Avoid single-impl abstraction, preserve semver, and control feature/provenance risk. | Impl inventory, semver check, cargo tree/audit/deny reports, accepted-risk owner. | `package-dependency-management`, `consumer-impact-analysis` | Dependency by convenience. |
| Existing Rust behavior reuse | Repository graph, project memory, old review, generated bindings, prior validation says safe. | Confirm current source, Cargo files, generated artifacts, and validation freshness before closure. | Inspected paths, accepted/rejected memory, changed-path validators, residual unknowns. | `repository-graph-analysis`, `validation-broker` | Stale memory as proof. |

# Non-Negotiable Rules

- **`unsafe` requires a `// SAFETY:` comment** documenting every invariant the caller (or the surrounding code) must uphold. Reviewed by ≥ 2 engineers including one fluent in unsafe Rust. Covered by `miri` tests where feasible.
- **No `unwrap()` / `expect()` / `panic!()` in library code** (`lib.rs` and its modules). Acceptable: tests, `main()`, and clearly documented `expect("static invariant")` for compile-time-known cases.
- **Error model**: libraries return typed `Result<T, E>` with `E` implementing `std::error::Error` (via `thiserror::Error`). Binaries can use `anyhow::Result<T>` for top-level. Mixing requires explicit conversion boundary.
- **Lifetimes model ownership; cloning is not the default.** `.clone()` on every shared value is rejected; use `&T`, `Arc<T>`, `Cow<'_, T>` deliberately. Profile when clone vs borrow vs Arc is unclear.
- **Trait abstractions justified by ≥ 2 implementations or a clear extension contract.** Single-impl traits are rejected unless they document the planned second implementation or serve as a test/mock boundary.
- **Async runtime is explicit and singular per process.** `tokio` (default) or `async-std`, never both. `tokio::main` / `#[tokio::test]` at entry points; `block_on` only outside async context.
- **Clippy + fmt + tests + audit + deny green in CI** — no `#[allow(clippy::...)]` without inline justification + owner.
- **Public API of libraries follows semver**: breaking change = major bump. Verified with `cargo semver-checks`.
- **Concurrency primitives**: prefer message passing (`tokio::sync::mpsc`) over shared `Arc<Mutex<T>>`. When `Arc<Mutex<T>>` is necessary, lock scope is minimal; never hold a lock across `.await`.
- **`Sync` / `Send` bounds** documented for types crossing thread boundaries.

# Industry Benchmarks

- **The Rust Programming Language ("the book")** and **Rust API Guidelines** (`rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines`).
- **Rustonomicon** for unsafe.
- **Tokio docs / tokio-console** for async runtime patterns and diagnostics.
- **Rust Performance Book** (Nicholas Nethercote) for allocation, profiling, build-time tuning.
- **Programming Rust** (Blandy / Orendorff / Tindall) and **Rust for Rustaceans** (Gjengset) as professional references.
- **CWE Top 25** — idiomatic Rust fixes: parameterized SQL via `sqlx::query!` macro; command injection — `std::process::Command::arg` (never shell); path traversal — `std::path::Path::canonicalize` + base check.
- **RustSec advisory DB** and **OSV-Scanner** for vulnerability detection.
- **`cargo semver-checks`** for library compatibility.

# Selection Rules

Select when Rust / Cargo / ownership / lifetimes / `unsafe` / traits / async runtime / WASM / FFI / systems performance is part of the request. Pair with `low-level-systems-extension` (unsafe, FFI, embedded), `language-performance-safety` (hot paths), `concurrency-control` (synchronization), `package-dependency-management` (Cargo deps), and `quality-test-gate` (fuzz / property evidence).

# Proactive Professional Triggers

- **Signal:** `unsafe`, raw pointer, FFI, `repr(C)`, custom allocator, `Pin`, or `no_std` appears without a written invariant. **Hidden risk:** Rust's safety story is bypassed and UB can survive ordinary tests. **Required professional action:** require a safety contract, safe wrapper, and unsafe-specific validation. **Route to:** `low-level-systems-extension`, `quality-test-gate`. **Evidence required:** `// SAFETY:` invariant, aliasing/lifetime/layout rule, Miri/fuzz/geiger command or not-run owner.
- **Signal:** `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `Box<dyn Error>`, or `anyhow` appears in a library or recoverable boundary. **Hidden risk:** consumers lose typed failure handling or hit production panics. **Required professional action:** design typed `Result` and panic boundaries before accepting the API. **Route to:** `failure-contract-design`, `code-review`. **Evidence required:** error enum/conversion map, no-panic scan, caller-visible negative tests, residual exception owner.
- **Signal:** async runtime, `tokio::spawn`, `block_on`, `Arc<Mutex<_>>`, channel, atomics, or lock across `.await` changes. **Hidden risk:** deadlock, cancellation leak, runtime mixing, or non-`Send` future appears only under scheduler pressure. **Required professional action:** review runtime singularity, lock scope, blocking calls, and concurrency validator depth. **Route to:** `concurrency-control`, `reliability-observability-gate`. **Evidence required:** runtime map, `await_holding_lock`/stress/loom evidence, skipped scheduler risks.
- **Signal:** new trait, `Box<dyn Trait>`, public generic, feature flag, workspace crate, or Cargo dependency is introduced. **Hidden risk:** Java-style abstraction, semver break, feature unification, or unreviewed advisory enters the graph. **Required professional action:** prove abstraction and dependency value before acceptance. **Route to:** `implementation-structure-design`, `package-dependency-management`. **Evidence required:** impl inventory, rejected concrete alternative, `cargo tree -e features`, audit/deny report, compatibility note.
- **Signal:** repository graph, project memory, generated bindings, or old validation claims Rust code is safe, unused, race-free, or already tested. **Hidden risk:** stale context misses current Cargo features, generated FFI callers, or changed unsafe/concurrency paths. **Required professional action:** confirm current source and validation freshness before handoff. **Route to:** `repository-graph-analysis`, `project-memory-governance`, `validation-broker`. **Evidence required:** inspected files, accepted/rejected memory, fresh command/report, remaining unknowns.

# Risk Escalation Rules

- Escalate to `low-level-systems-extension` for `unsafe`, FFI, `extern "C"`, embedded / `#![no_std]`, custom allocator, SIMD, or lock-free primitives.
- Escalate to `language-performance-safety` for hot paths, allocation profiling, async runtime diagnostics.
- Escalate to `quality-test-gate` for fuzz / property / `miri` / `loom` evidence.
- Escalate to `concurrency-control` for `Mutex` / channel / atomics / memory-ordering design.
- Escalate to `package-dependency-management` for Cargo dep additions, `cargo audit` / `cargo deny` advisories, license review.
- Escalate to `security-privacy-gate` for `unsafe` exposed to untrusted input, deserialization (serde with `deny_unknown_fields`), command/SQL injection.

# Critical Details

- **Borrow checker errors are design feedback.** Fighting the borrow checker with `Rc<RefCell<T>>` everywhere is usually a sign the data model is wrong; redesign data flow.
- **`.clone()` cost varies enormously**: cloning a `String` allocates; cloning an `Arc<T>` is an atomic increment; cloning a `&str` is free. Be explicit about which.
- **`async` is contagious.** Once a function is async, all callers must be async or use `block_on`. Async runtime selection is therefore a load-bearing decision.
- **Holding a lock across `.await`** — if the future is cancelled or moved to a different runtime thread, the lock may not release as expected; use `tokio::sync::Mutex` (async-aware) and minimize critical section, or restructure to release before await.
- **`tokio::spawn` requires `'static`** — spawned futures cannot borrow stack data; use `Arc` / `Clone` for shared state.
- **`Send` / `Sync` are auto-traits** — a type containing `Rc` is `!Send`; a type with interior mutability via `RefCell` is `!Sync`. Use `Arc` + `Mutex` for cross-thread.
- **`Pin<T>`** required for self-referential futures; almost always handled by `tokio::spawn` / async machinery; manual `Pin` work indicates designing a future / stream and requires `Pin` correctness review.
- **`unsafe` invariants** must specify: lifetime/aliasing rules (no overlapping mutable references), alignment, validity (no `&T` to invalid bits), thread-safety, panic safety (no panic across FFI boundary without `catch_unwind`).
- **FFI**: `extern "C"` boundary requires `#[repr(C)]` on shared types; never let Rust panic propagate across FFI (use `std::panic::catch_unwind` at the boundary).
- **`Vec::with_capacity` / `String::with_capacity`** when size is known — avoids reallocation in tight loops.
- **Iterator chains often compile to optimal code** — prefer them over manual indexing; verify with `cargo asm` / godbolt when claims matter.
- **`#[non_exhaustive]` on public enums / structs** for forward-compat in libraries.
- **`serde` with `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`** at trust boundaries to prevent silent field drift / injection.
- **Cargo features unification surprise**: a transitive crate enabling a feature you don't want. Audit with `cargo tree -e features -f "{p} {f}"`.

# Failure Modes

- **Undocumented `unsafe`** — Symptom: invariant violation under refactor; UB. Cause: missing `// SAFETY:` block; assumed invariants not documented. Detection: `cargo geiger`, code review. Impact: memory safety lost, security exposure.
- **`unwrap()` in library** — Symptom: library panics in consumer code path. Cause: error handling shortcut. Detection: clippy `unwrap_used` lint. Impact: consumer outage.
- **Lock held across `.await`** — Symptom: deadlock / cancellation hang. Cause: `let g = mutex.lock().unwrap(); some_async().await;`. Detection: clippy `await_holding_lock`. Impact: deadlock.
- **Async runtime mixing** — Symptom: panic about "no reactor running" or undefined behavior. Cause: tokio future polled by async-std executor. Detection: review + runtime-aware tests. Impact: production crash.
- **`.clone()` everywhere** — Symptom: allocator hot in profile; latency high. Cause: avoiding borrow checker via clone. Detection: profile + review. Impact: allocator pressure, GC-like cost.
- **Single-impl trait** — Symptom: `trait Foo` with one `impl Foo for Concrete`; tests box-dyn-mock. Cause: Java-style abstraction. Detection: review. Impact: complexity tax with no abstraction value.
- **`Box<dyn Error>` everywhere** — Symptom: lost type information; `match` impossible. Cause: error model not designed. Detection: review for `thiserror` enum at library boundaries. Impact: poor error handling at consumer.
- **FFI panic propagation** — Symptom: undefined behavior in C caller after Rust panic. Cause: panic crossed `extern "C"`. Detection: `catch_unwind` at FFI boundary mandatory; tests for panic paths. Impact: UB in C ABI.
- **`Vec` growth in hot path** — Symptom: profile shows `realloc` hot. Cause: `Vec::push` without `with_capacity`. Detection: profile. Impact: latency.
- **Cargo feature explosion** — Symptom: build pulls unexpected heavy deps. Cause: transitive feature unification. Detection: `cargo tree -e features`. Impact: bloat, build time.

# Reference Loading Policy

Load [references/checklist.md](references/checklist.md) when Rust changes touch ownership/lifetimes, error modeling, async/runtime behavior, unsafe, FFI, trait/public API design, concurrency, Cargo dependencies, feature flags, or validation tooling such as clippy, Miri, loom, fuzzing, cargo audit, or cargo test. Use [examples/example-output.md](examples/example-output.md) only when the expected review shape is unclear. Do not load references for rustfmt-only edits.

# Output Contract

Return a **Rust Usage Review** containing:
- **Mode selected**: ownership/error, unsafe/FFI/layout, async/concurrency, trait/API/dependency, or existing-behavior reuse, with trigger signal
- **Boundaries inspected**: crates/modules, public APIs, unsafe blocks, FFI/generated bindings, async runtime entrypoints, Cargo files, tests, docs, generated artifacts, and skipped boundaries with reason
- **Toolchain pin** (`rust-toolchain.toml`), **edition**, **MSRV**
- **Tooling pins**: clippy lint set, rustfmt config, cargo-audit / cargo-deny / cargo-semver-checks status
- **Ownership / borrowing model**: clone audit; `Arc` / `Cow` / lifetime choices justified
- **Error model**: `thiserror` vs `anyhow` boundary; `Result<T, E>` discipline; panic boundaries
- **`unsafe` blocks**: each with `// SAFETY:` doc, reviewer names, miri coverage
- **Async runtime**: declared (tokio / async-std); singular per process; `tokio-console` available
- **Concurrency**: lock scope; no `.await` while holding sync lock; channel vs Arc<Mutex> choice; `Send`/`Sync` bounds documented
- **Trait audit**: each trait has ≥ 2 impls or documented extension contract
- **Dependencies**: `cargo audit` / `cargo deny` results; feature audit (`cargo tree -e features`)
- **Public API compat** (libraries): `cargo semver-checks` verdict
- **Tests**: unit + property (proptest / quickcheck) + fuzz (cargo-fuzz) + loom (concurrency) + miri (unsafe) coverage
- **Performance**: criterion benchmarks for hot paths; allocation profile
- **Rust graph, memory, and execution freshness**: crate graph, generated bindings, Cargo files, project-memory claims, and previous Rust validation accepted, rejected, stale, or not verified after the final edit
- **Rust validation proof**: literal cargo or validator command, exit code, report/artifact path, and what the output proves or does not prove
- **Tool permission boundary**: test/Miri/loom/fuzz/build/Cargo-audit/generated-artifact command class, sandbox/approval state, write scope, and secret-output redaction rule
- **Accepted Rust deviations** with owner, scope, expiration, and cleanup trigger

# Evidence Contract

A Rust change is professionally complete only when the output includes:

- **Ownership boundary**: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, clone/copy cost, and mutation boundary.
- **Error model**: `Result`, typed errors, `thiserror`/`anyhow` boundary, and no panic in recoverable path.
- **Async/runtime boundary**: runtime assumptions, cancellation, `Send`/`Sync`, blocking calls inside async.
- **Unsafe boundary**: justification, invariants, tests, and safe wrapper if `unsafe` appears.
- **Trait/API design**: trait object vs generic choice, coherence, object safety, and public API stability.
- **Validation evidence**: `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt`, Miri/loom when applicable, or not-verified disclosure.
- **What evidence proves**: the inspected Rust safety and API boundary is covered.
- **What evidence does not prove**: every platform, production concurrency, FFI caller behavior, or all unsafe aliasing scenarios.
- **Graph and memory freshness**: current source, generated artifacts, Cargo manifests, toolchain config, and prior project-memory claims confirmed or rejected before closure.
- **Rust residual risk**: untested runtime/platform/scheduler/FFI/dependency behavior, owner, and next gate.

# Quality Gate

1. `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` + `cargo test --locked` + `cargo audit` + `cargo deny check` all green.
2. Every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:` comment; miri tests where feasible; ≥ 2 reviewers including unsafe-fluent.
3. No `unwrap()` / `expect()` / `panic!()` in library code without justification.
4. Async runtime declared and singular; no `await_holding_lock`.
5. Traits justified (≥ 2 impls or documented extension contract).
6. Public library API: `cargo semver-checks` verdict matches version bump.
7. Hot paths have criterion benchmarks; allocation profile reviewed if claims involve performance.
8. Parsers / deserializers / FFI boundaries have fuzz harness or property tests.
9. `cargo geiger` reviewed; unsafe surface area minimized.
10. Cargo features audited; no transitive feature surprises.
11. Validation report maps each changed Rust path to command, exit code, covered risk, stale/not-run targets, and residual owner.
12. Tool permission/sandbox record exists for test, Miri, loom, fuzz, build, audit, deny, semver, generated-binding, or artifact-writing commands.
