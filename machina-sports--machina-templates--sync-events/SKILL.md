# Polymarket - Sync Events

Syncs active sports events from Polymarket Gamma API into `polymarket-events` documents with vector embeddings.

## Workflow

**Name**: `polymarket-sync-events`

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `tag_id` | `1` (Sports) | Polymarket tag filter |
| `series_id` | `""` (all) | Filter by series/league |
| `limit` | `100` | Max events to fetch |
| `offset` | `0` | Pagination offset |

## Usage

```python
# Sync all sports events
mcp__docker-localhost__execute_workflow(
    name="polymarket-sync-events",
    input_data={"tag_id": 1, "limit": 100}
)

# Sync events from a specific series/league
mcp__docker-localhost__execute_workflow(
    name="polymarket-sync-events",
    input_data={"series_id": "<series_id>", "limit": 50}
)
```

## Pipeline

```
get_sports_events → polymarket-event-mapping → bulk-save (polymarket-events)
```
