```

The audit will:
1. Scan all source files for vulnerabilities
2. Check dependencies for known CVEs
3. Search for exposed secrets
4. Analyze code quality metrics
5. Generate comprehensive report

### Category-Specific Audits

**Security Only**:
```
Run a security audit focusing on OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities
```

**Dependencies Only**:
```
Audit all dependencies for vulnerabilities and outdated packages
```

**Secrets Only**:
```
Scan for exposed secrets and credentials
```

**Code Quality Only**:
```
Analyze code quality and identify code smells
```

### Targeted Audits

**Specific Directory**:
```
Audit the /src/auth directory for security issues
```

**Specific Files**:
```
Audit UserController.ts and AuthService.ts for vulnerabilities
```

**Pre-Deployment**:
```
Run pre-deployment audit checklist
```

```

## Integration with Dev Plugin

### With Code Analysis Agent

Use code-analysis enrichment before audit:

```
First enrich the codebase with claudemem, then run security audit
```

This provides:
- Context-aware vulnerability detection
- Better false positive filtering
- Dependency graph analysis

### With Test Architect Agent

Combine audit with test coverage:

```
Run audit and identify untested critical code paths
```

### With Optimize Skill

Security-performance trade-offs:

```
Audit security implications of performance optimizations
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Audits

**Recommended Schedule**:
- Daily: Dependency vulnerability scans (CI/CD)
- Weekly: Full security audit
- Pre-deployment: Comprehensive audit
- Post-incident: Targeted security review

### 2. Incremental Audits

For large codebases:

```
Audit files changed in the last 7 days
```

This focuses on recent changes and reduces noise.

### 3. Baseline and Track

**First Audit**:
```
Run full audit and establish security baseline
```

**Subsequent Audits**:
```
Run audit and compare against baseline
```

Track improvements over time.

### 4. Prioritize by Risk

Focus on:
1. User-facing authentication code
2. Payment processing
3. Data storage and retrieval
4. API endpoints with PII
5. Third-party integrations

### 5. Automate in CI/CD

**GitHub Actions Example**:
```yaml
- name: Security Audit
  run: |
    npm audit --audit-level=high
    # Run custom audit script
```

**Pre-commit Hook**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Scan staged files for secrets
git diff --cached --name-only | xargs grep -E "(api_key|secret|password)"
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Pre-Deployment Security Audit

**Request**:
```
We're deploying to production tomorrow. Run a comprehensive security audit.
```

**Audit Process**:
1. Scan all source files for OWASP top 10
2. Check all dependencies for CVEs
3. Search for exposed secrets
4. Verify CORS and authentication config
5. Check logging and monitoring setup

**Report Highlights**:
- 1 CRITICAL: Exposed database password
- 2 HIGH: Outdated dependencies with CVEs
- 5 MEDIUM: Missing input validation
- Compliance: 8/10 OWASP categories passing

**Outcome**: Deployment blocked until CRITICAL/HIGH fixed

### Example 2: Dependency Vulnerability Scan

**Request**:
```
Check all npm dependencies for known vulnerabilities
```

**Process**:
1. Run `npm audit --json`
2. Parse vulnerability reports
3. Check for available fixes
4. Identify breaking changes

**Report**:
```
Found 3 vulnerabilities (1 high, 2 moderate)

HIGH: axios@0.21.1 (CVE-2021-3749)
- Fix available: axios@0.21.4
- Breaking: No
- Run: npm install axios@0.21.4

[PASS] Consent management implemented
[WARN] Privacy policy link outdated
[PASS] TLS 1.3 enforced
```

### Example 4: Code Quality Audit

**Request**:
```
Identify code quality issues and technical debt
```

**Analysis**:
- Complexity: 8 functions exceed threshold
- Duplication: 15% code duplication
- Dead code: 23 unused exports
- Large files: 4 files over 500 lines
- Magic numbers: 47 instances

**Top Issues**:
