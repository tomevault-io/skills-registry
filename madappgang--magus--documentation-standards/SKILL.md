# Documentation Standards

## Overview

Comprehensive documentation standards based on research from Google, Microsoft, GitLab,
Red Hat style guides, and 60+ additional sources. Provides templates, best practices,
and anti-pattern detection for AI agents writing documentation.

---

## 15 Best Practices (Ranked by Consensus)

### UNANIMOUS (100% Agreement)

#### 1. Use Active Voice and Present Tense

**Why**: Reduces cognitive load 20-30%, shortens sentences 15-25%

**Implementation**:
```markdown
BAD (passive): The request is processed by the server.
GOOD (active): The server processes the request.

BAD (future): The program will save your file.
GOOD (present): The program saves your file.
```

**Validation**: Check for "is/are/was/were + past participle" patterns

---

#### 2. Start with 5-Minute Quick Start

**Why**: 70% of visitors are first-time users, time-to-first-success critical

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## Quick Start

```bash
npm install my-tool
npx my-tool init
npx my-tool start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000

That's it!
```

**Validation**: Can a new user succeed in under 5 minutes with zero context?

---

#### 3. Use Progressive Disclosure (Three-Tier Structure)

**Why**: Accommodates all skill levels, reduces overwhelm

**Implementation**:
```
Tier 1: Quick Start (2-5 min)
  -> Copy-paste code, immediate success, no explanations

Tier 2: Tutorial (15-30 min)
  -> Step-by-step with explanations, build one feature

Tier 3: Reference (lookup)
  -> Complete API docs, searchable, advanced patterns
```

---

#### 4. Use Second Person ("You")

**Why**: Increases engagement, reduces word count 15-25%

**Implementation**:
```markdown
BAD: The user should configure the settings.
GOOD: Configure the settings.

BAD: One can install the plugin by...
GOOD: Install the plugin by...
```

---

#### 5. Keep Sentences Under 25 Words

**Why**: Comprehension drops 30% when sentences exceed 30 words

**Implementation**:
```markdown
BAD (42 words): The configuration file, which should be located in the
root directory of your project and named .claude, contains all the settings
that are required for the plugin system to function correctly and load
the appropriate agents.

GOOD (18 words): Place the `.claude` configuration file in your project
root. It contains settings for the plugin system and agents.
```

---

#### 6. Use Lists and Tables for Comparison

**Why**: 70% faster comprehension vs paragraphs

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## Prerequisites

Before starting, you need:
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] Git access to GitHub
- [ ] API token configured

## Tool Comparison

| Tool | Best For | Stars | Learning Curve |
|------|----------|-------|----------------|
| Docusaurus | React | 55k+ | Medium |
| VitePress | Vue | 12k+ | Low |
```

---

### STRONG (67%+ Agreement)

#### 7. Use Language-Specific Documentation Tools

**Why**: Deep language integration, automatic type inference

**Decision Matrix**:
```
Language -> Tool:
- TypeScript -> TSDoc comments + TypeDoc generator
- Python -> Google/NumPy docstrings + Sphinx
- Rust -> /// comments + rustdoc
- Go -> Plain comments + godoc
- Java -> Javadoc
```

---

#### 8. Follow Diataxis Framework

**Why**: Clear taxonomy reduces confusion

**Four Types**:
| Type | Purpose | Length | When to Use |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Tutorial | Teach by doing | 15-60 min | "I'm new, show me" |
| How-To | Solve problem | 5-15 min | "I need to do X" |
| Reference | Describe what exists | As needed | "What parameters?" |
| Explanation | Clarify concepts | 5-30 min | "Why does this work?" |

---

#### 9. Show Code Examples with Expected Output

**Why**: Users know what success looks like

**Implementation**:
```markdown
### Example: Fetching User Data

**Code:**
```typescript
const user = await api.getUserById('user-123');
console.log(user.name, user.email);
```

**Expected Output:**
```
John Doe john@example.com
```

**Error Case:**
```typescript
const user = await api.getUserById('invalid-id');
// Throws: NotFoundError: User with ID 'invalid-id' not found
```
```

---

#### 10. Provide Troubleshooting Section

**Why**: 50%+ of support questions are error-related

**Template**:
```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Command not found

**Symptom**: `/implement` returns "command not found"
**Cause**: Plugin not enabled
**Solution**:
1. Check `.claude/settings.json`
2. Run `/plugin reload`
3. Restart if needed

**Prevention**: Verify with `/plugin list`
```

---

#### 11. Organize by Task ("How do I...")

**Why**: Users think in terms of goals, not architecture

**Implementation**:
```markdown
## Guides

### How-To Guides (Task-Oriented)
- [How to deploy to production](deploy.md)
- [How to add authentication](auth.md)
- [How to handle file uploads](uploads.md)
```

---

#### 12. Add Prerequisites Checklist

**Why**: Eliminates invisible barriers for beginners

**Template**:
```markdown
## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed ([Download](https://nodejs.org))
- [ ] Basic JavaScript knowledge
- [ ] Text editor (VS Code recommended)
```

---

### AI-SPECIFIC

#### 13. Verify Examples Actually Work

**Why**: Prevents hallucination and outdated examples

**Process**:
1. Read function implementation
2. Extract actual parameters and return type
3. Test example code
4. Document actual output

---

#### 14. Ground Documentation in Source Code

**Why**: Prevents documenting non-existent features

**Process**:
1. Read source code FIRST
2. Only document features that exist
3. Use actual type signatures
4. If uncertain, qualify with "typically", "generally"

---

#### 15. Add Version Tracking

**Why**: Users need to know if docs apply to their version

**Template**:
```markdown
---
**Version**: v2.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-09
**Compatible With**: Claude Code 1.5+, TypeScript 5.0+
---

> **DEPRECATED**: This approach works but superseded by [New Approach](link)
```

---

## Anti-Slop Writing Rules

These rules eliminate AI-detectable writing patterns and enforce professional technical writing standards.
Every doc-writer and doc-fixer agent MUST apply these rules. The doc-analyzer agent MUST check for violations.

### Rule S1: Banned Words and Phrases

NEVER use these words or phrases. Each tier has escalating severity.

**CRITICAL — instant disqualifier (AI generation artifacts):**
- "As an AI", "As a language model", "I'd be happy to", "Certainly!", "Absolutely!", "Great question!", "I hope this helps", "Feel free to ask", "Let me explain", "Allow me to clarify"
- "In today's [anything] world", "In an increasingly [adj]", "In the realm of", "At the heart of", "The weight of [X]"

**HIGH — marketing superlatives and difficulty dismissers:**
- amazing, revolutionary, powerful, robust, seamlessly, effortlessly, incredible, world-class, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, next-generation, innovative, game-changing, industry-leading, best-in-class
- simply, easy, just, obviously, of course, clearly, trivially, straightforward, quick

**MEDIUM — corporate jargon and filler:**
- leverage, utilize, streamline, facilitate, empower, unlock, accelerate, transform, drive (metaphorical), deliver value, synergy/synergize, actioning, comprehensive (unless you enumerate what it covers)
- "it is worth noting that", "it is important to note", "please note that", "as mentioned above", "as stated earlier", "due to the fact that" (use "because"), "in the event that" (use "if"), "in order to" (use "to"), "might potentially", "could potentially", "may or may not"

**STRUCTURAL OVERHEAD — throat-clearing and meta-commentary:**
- "In this section, we will discuss...", "This document covers...", "Now that we have...", "As you can see...", "This section explains...", "Let's explore...", "Let's take a look at...", "Let's dive into..."
- Never begin a section with a sentence that describes the section. Start with the first piece of actual content.

**HEDGING CASCADES — qualify-then-qualify patterns:**
- "It's important to note that... depending on your specific use case"
- "While this may vary... it generally tends to..."
- "...depending on your particular requirements/needs/situation"
- Maximum 2 hedge phrases per 1000 words. Technical docs should be authoritative.

---

### Rule S2: Sentence Length and Rhythm

Vary sentence lengths for natural rhythm. Monotonous sentence length signals AI generation.

**Targets:**
- Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- Short sentences (≤10 words) for key points and transitions
- Medium sentences (11-25 words) for explanations
- Long sentences (26-40 words) allowed for complex technical explanations, maximum 1 per paragraph
- NEVER exceed 40 words in a single sentence

**Anti-monotony rule**: No more than 3 consecutive sentences within ±5 words of each other.

**Transitions**: Words like "however", "therefore", "for example" help readers connect ideas. Use them — but don't open more than 40% of paragraphs with an explicit transition word.

---

### Rule S3: Structural Variety (Anti-AI-Pattern)

AI-generated text has detectable patterns. Avoid these:

**Paragraph variety**: Don't lock every paragraph into topic-sentence → supports → conclusion. Start some paragraphs with:
- A code example that you then explain
- A question that you then answer
- A concrete scenario or use case
- A contrast ("Unlike X, this approach...")

**List variety**: Don't make every list exactly 3 or 5 items. Use 2, 4, 6, or 7 items when the content calls for it. Never pad a list with filler items to reach a round number.

**Section length variety**: Vary section lengths. Some sections need 50 words, others need 300. Don't make every section approximately the same length.

---

### Rule S4: Code-to-Prose Ratio

Target 40%+ code coverage (code blocks as a percentage of total content). Developer documentation should show, not tell. Every concept explanation should have an accompanying code example within 2 paragraphs.

---

### Rule S5: Enhanced Heading Rules

Following Stripe/Twilio/Vercel patterns:
- Maximum 3 heading levels per page (H1 → H2 → H3). Never use H4.
- One H2 per 200-400 words of body text.
- Use sentence case for headings, not Title Case.
- Compress structural signals into headings, not opening sentences:
  - BAD: `## Prerequisites` followed by "Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:"
  - GOOD: `## Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, plugin SDK`

---

### Rule S6: Enhanced Progressive Disclosure

Lead with essentials. Layer details in 5 tiers:
1. One-paragraph overview (what + why)
2. Quick-start example (5-minute version)
3. Detailed walkthrough
4. Reference tables
5. Edge cases and advanced usage

Use collapsible sections (`<details>`) for advanced content that most readers skip.

**Escape hatches**: At each tier, provide a link forward for users who already know the basics ("Already familiar? Skip to the API reference →").

---

### Rule S7: Conciseness

Every sentence must add new information. Delete:
- Introductory throat-clearing ("In this section, we will discuss...")
- Repetition of the same point in different words
- Filler paragraphs that summarize what's coming next
- Conclusions that repeat what was already said

---

### Rule S8: Diagram Requirements

Include at least one Mermaid diagram for architecture or flow documentation.
Diagrams must:
- Use correct Mermaid syntax
- Match the text they accompany
- Add information that prose alone cannot convey (flow, timing, relationships)
- Have descriptive labels (not "Step 1", "Step 2")

---

### Rule S9: Enhanced Code Examples

Every code example must:
- Be complete enough to copy-paste and use
- Show expected output or behavior in a comment
- Use realistic values (not "foo", "bar", "example")

---

### Rule S10: Active Voice Exceptions

Target: <10% passive voice sentences. Use imperative mood for instructions.

**Exception**: Use passive voice when the actor is irrelevant or unknown:
- OK: "The configuration file is parsed at startup" (who parses it doesn't matter)
- OK: "Skills are cached after first load" (the caching mechanism is an implementation detail)

---

### Template 2: TSDoc Function Documentation

**Purpose**: Document TypeScript functions
**Format**: TSDoc standard
**Use When**: Documenting public APIs

```typescript
/**
 * Retrieves a user by their unique identifier.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This function includes user permissions and preferences in the response.
 * Results are cached for 5 minutes to reduce database load.
 *
 * @param id - User unique identifier (UUID format)
 * @param options - Optional fetch configuration
 * @param options.includePermissions - Include user permissions (default: true)
 *
 * @returns Promise resolving to User object with permissions
 *
 * @throws {NotFoundError} If user with given ID doesn't exist
 * @throws {UnauthorizedError} If caller lacks 'read:users' permission
 *
 * @example
 * Basic usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const user = await getUserById('user-123');
 * console.log(user.name, user.email);
 * // Output: John Doe john@example.com
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * Error handling:
 * ```typescript
 * try {
 *   const user = await getUserById('user-123');
 * } catch (error) {
 *   if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {
 *     console.error('User not found');
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link createUser} for creating new users
 * @since 2.0.0
 * @public
 */
```

### Template 3: Error Documentation

**Purpose**: Document common errors and solutions
**Organization**: By symptom
**Use When**: Creating troubleshooting guides

```markdown
# Troubleshooting Guide

## Installation Issues

### Error: EACCES permission denied

**Symptom**: npm install fails with permission error

**Full Error Message**:
```
npm ERR! code EACCES
npm ERR! syscall access
npm ERR! path /usr/local/lib
```

**Cause**: Trying to install globally without proper permissions

**Solution**:

**Option 1 (Recommended)**: Install locally
```bash
npm install --save-dev my-tool
npx my-tool
```

**Option 2**: Fix npm permissions
```bash
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```

**Prevention**: Use local installation (avoid -g flag)

---

### Error: Module not found

**Symptom**: Import fails with "Cannot find module 'X'"

**Causes**:
1. Package not installed
2. Wrong import path
3. TypeScript configuration issue

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Verify package is installed
```bash
npm list my-package
```

**Step 2**: Check import path matches package name
```typescript
// CORRECT
import { func } from 'my-package';

// WRONG
import { func } from 'my-package/lib/index';
```

**Prevention**: Always install dependencies before importing
```

---

### Template 4: Tutorial Structure

**Purpose**: Teach by doing
**Length**: 15-30 minutes
**Use When**: Creating beginner tutorials

```markdown
# Tutorial: Building Your First REST API

**What you'll learn**:
- How to create a basic REST API
- How to define routes and handlers
- How to connect to a database
- How to handle errors

**Prerequisites**:
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed ([Download](https://nodejs.org))
- [ ] Basic JavaScript knowledge
- [ ] Text editor (VS Code recommended)

**Estimated time**: 30 minutes

---

## Step 1: Set Up Project

Create a new directory and initialize npm:

```bash
mkdir my-api
cd my-api
npm init -y
```

**What this does**: Creates package.json with default settings

---

## Step 2: Create Basic Server

Create `src/server.ts`:

```typescript
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

**What this does**:
- Imports Express framework
- Creates Express application
- Defines route for GET /
- Starts server on port 3000

---

## Step 3: Test Your API

Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected output**:
```
Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

Test the endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

**Expected response**:
```json
{"message":"Hello, World!"}
```

Success! You've created your first API endpoint.

---

## What You've Built

You now have a basic REST API with:
- Express server
- TypeScript configuration
- First endpoint
- Error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Add a database**: [Tutorial: Connect to PostgreSQL](postgres.md)
2. **Add authentication**: [Tutorial: Add JWT Authentication](auth.md)
3. **Deploy**: [Guide: Deploy to Vercel](deploy.md)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Server won't start

**Solution**: Check if port 3000 is already in use:
```bash
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
```
```

### Template 6: Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

**Purpose**: Document significant architecture decisions
**Format**: Lightweight ADR
**Use When**: Technology choices, patterns, security decisions

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

## Status

Accepted (2026-01-09)

## Context

We need persistent storage for user data, transactions, and analytics.

**Requirements**:
- Store structured user data
- Support complex queries
- ACID compliance for transactions
- Handle 100K users, 1M records/month

## Decision

We will use **PostgreSQL 15+** as our primary database.

**Implementation**:
- Host on AWS RDS
- Use connection pooling (pgBouncer)
- Enable read replicas

## Consequences

### Positive
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Rich query capabilities (JSON, full-text search)
- Proven scaling path

### Negative
- Schema migrations require planning
- Not optimal for document storage

### Risks
- **Risk**: Database bottleneck at scale
- **Mitigation**: Early read replicas and caching

## Alternatives Considered

### MongoDB
**Pros**: Flexible schema, horizontal scaling
**Cons**: Limited transactions, weaker consistency
**Why rejected**: Financial data requires ACID

### DynamoDB
**Pros**: Fully managed, auto-scaling
**Cons**: Vendor lock-in, complex pricing
**Why rejected**: Team expertise in SQL

## Anti-Pattern Detection Patterns

### OVER_MARKETING
**Severity**: HIGH
**Description**: Marketing hype buries quick start 64+ lines deep
**Detection**: Search for words: "amazing", "revolutionary", "best", "incredible", "powerful". Check if quick start appears after line 30.
**Impact**: 30-minute barrier to first success (should be <5 min)
**Fix**: Move quick start to first 20 lines, remove superlatives

### STALE_DOCS
**Severity**: HIGH
**Description**: No version tracking or last-updated dates
**Detection**: Missing: "Last Updated:", "Version:", "As of v". No YAML frontmatter with date/version.
**Impact**: Users don't know if docs apply to their version
**Fix**: Add version header with date

### MISSING_ERROR_RECOVERY
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Description**: Happy path only, no troubleshooting
