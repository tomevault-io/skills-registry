# React Native Animations

A philosophy and decision framework for building great motion on React Native. Covers Reanimated (values, worklets, layout animations), Gesture Handler (pan, pinch, composition), and Skia (canvas-driven animation) — the three libraries that make mobile motion feel native in 2026.

This skill is opinionated. It does not cover the legacy `Animated` API, Moti, or Lottie — when those are the right tool, this skill does not apply.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Building any animation or transition in a React Native or Expo app
- Adding gesture-driven interactions (swipe, drag, pinch, pull-to-refresh)
- Reviewing animation code for performance or polish
- Choosing between Reanimated, Skia, or native views for a motion task
- Deciding easing curves, durations, or spring parameters
- Handling Reduce Motion accessibility settings

## Foundational Philosophy

Three principles underlie every decision in this skill. When in doubt, return to these.

**1. Motion serves the spatial model.** On mobile, animation is not decoration — it is how users understand where content comes from and where it goes. Modals rise from the button that opened them. Drawers slide from the edge they're anchored to. A swipe that dismisses a card moves with the finger until the gesture ends. If motion does not teach the user something about the interface's structure, it should not exist.

**2. The UI thread is sacred.** Every animation that touches the JS thread is a visible stutter waiting to happen. Reanimated worklets, shared values, and native gesture handlers exist for exactly one reason: to run motion at 60–120fps on a thread that never blocks. Any code pattern that forces an animation back to JS is a bug.

**3. Motion should match device physics.** iOS users expect spring-based, slightly overshooting motion with deceleration-dominant curves. Android/Material users expect the "standard curve" — quick acceleration, slow deceleration. Don't ship the same linear tween on both platforms and call it cross-platform.

## Animation Decision Framework

Four questions, in order. Skip any of them and motion becomes noise.

### 1. Should this animate?

| Frequency of interaction | Recommendation |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| 100+ times/day | No animation. Users want instant. |
| Dozens/day | Reduce or remove. Consider scale-only feedback. |
| Occasional | Standard animation. |
| Rare (onboarding, celebration) | Add delight. |

Mobile-specific addition: **Does it serve orientation in the navigation stack?** A push transition teaches "this came from there." A fade teaches nothing spatial. If the answer is "it serves orientation," animate; otherwise default to instant.

### 2. What's the purpose?

Valid reasons to animate on mobile:
- **Spatial continuity** between screens or states
- **Gesture feedback** — the finger is dragging, something should move with it
- **State indication** — loading, success, error, selection
- **Preventing jarring layout shifts** — items appearing in a list, keyboard opening
- **Teaching gesture availability** — bottom sheet preview bounce, swipe affordance

If you cannot name one of these reasons, cut the animation.

### 3. Which easing?

Defaults that work everywhere:

| Use case | Easing | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Entering (mount, appear) | `Easing.out(Easing.cubic)` | Decelerates into place — iOS-feeling |
| Exiting (unmount, dismiss) | `Easing.in(Easing.cubic)` | Accelerates away |
| Moving / morphing | `Easing.inOut(Easing.cubic)` | Material "standard curve" |
| Gesture follow | `withSpring({ damping: 15, stiffness: 150 })` | Physics, not time |
| Infinite loader | `Easing.linear` | The only time linear is acceptable |

Never use `Easing.in` or `Easing.inOut` for mount animations — delayed initial movement feels sluggish.

For custom curves, prefer `cubicBezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` as an iOS-style entering curve. Material's standard curve is `cubicBezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`.

See `references/easing-and-timing.md` for the full reference table.

### 4. Which duration?

| Interaction | Duration |
|-------------|----------|
| Button press / scale feedback | 100–160ms |
| Toast, icon toggle, small UI | 150–200ms |
| Navigation push/pop, modal | 250–400ms |
| Drawer, bottom sheet | 300–500ms |
| Onboarding illustration | 500–1000ms |

**Never exceed 500ms for standard navigation.** Beyond that, the user perceives lag, not motion. Spring animations don't have a duration — they have physics, and physics should feel like the device.

## The Reanimated Mental Model

Before writing any animation code, internalize these concepts.

**`useSharedValue`** — a value that lives on the UI thread. Mutations don't trigger React re-renders. It is the atom of Reanimated.

```tsx
const offset = useSharedValue(0);
offset.value = 100; // No re-render. The UI thread sees the new value immediately.
```

**`useAnimatedStyle`** — a worklet that reads shared values and returns a style object. Runs on the UI thread whenever its shared values change.

```tsx
const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  transform: [{ translateX: offset.value }],
}));
```

**`withTiming` / `withSpring`** — animation drivers that return values over time. Assign the return value to a shared value to animate it.

```tsx
offset.value = withSpring(100, { damping: 15, stiffness: 150 });
```

**Worklets** — functions marked with `'worklet'` that run on the UI thread. Gesture callbacks are automatically workletized. To call a JS function from a worklet, wrap it in `runOnJS`.

```tsx
const tap = Gesture.Tap().onEnd(() => {
  'worklet';
  runOnJS(logAnalytics)('tap');
});
```

**Layout animations** — declarative mount/unmount and reorder animations. The easiest path to polish.

```tsx
<Animated.View entering={FadeIn.duration(300)} exiting={FadeOut} />
```

**`Animated.View` is not `View`.** Regular `View` doesn't participate in the worklet render pipeline. Every component that consumes an animated style must be an `Animated.*` component.

**Critical bug to avoid:** mutating a shared value inside `useAnimatedStyle` causes undefined behavior — potentially an infinite loop. Shared values are written from event handlers, effects, or gesture callbacks — never from inside the style worklet.

See `references/reanimated-patterns.md` for API recipes.

## Gesture-Driven Animation

Gesture Handler v2 is a declarative API composed with Reanimated. This is where mobile motion becomes mobile.

**Core gestures:** `Gesture.Pan()`, `Gesture.Pinch()`, `Gesture.Tap()`, `Gesture.LongPress()`, `Gesture.Rotation()`, `Gesture.Fling()`.

**Composition:**
- `Gesture.Simultaneous(a, b)` — both active at once (pinch + pan in a photo viewer)
- `Gesture.Race(a, b)` — first to activate wins
- `Gesture.Exclusive(a, b)` — one blocks the others

**Canonical pan-to-dismiss pattern:**

```tsx
const translateY = useSharedValue(0);

const pan = Gesture.Pan()
  .onUpdate((e) => {
    translateY.value = Math.max(0, e.translationY);
  })
  .onEnd((e) => {
    const shouldDismiss = translateY.value > 100 || e.velocityY > 500;
    if (shouldDismiss) {
      translateY.value = withTiming(SCREEN_HEIGHT, { duration: 250 });
      runOnJS(onDismiss)();
    } else {
      translateY.value = withSpring(0, { damping: 15, stiffness: 150 });
    }
  });
```

Three things to notice:
1. **Velocity matters.** A fast flick should dismiss even before the threshold distance. Always read `event.velocityX` / `velocityY` in `onEnd`.
2. **Springs for snap-back.** Rubber-band-feeling returns use `withSpring`, not `withTiming`.
3. **`runOnJS` for commit.** Navigation, haptics, and analytics all cross the thread boundary via `runOnJS`.

**Haptic coordination:** fire `Haptics.impactAsync` via `runOnJS` at gesture commit points (activation, snap, dismiss). Never inside `onUpdate` — you'll haptic every frame.

**Interruption:** spring animations must be interruptible. If a new pan starts mid-snap-back, the shared value is simply reassigned and `withSpring` takes over from the current velocity. Never queue animations with callbacks when you could use `withSequence`.

See `references/gesture-handler-patterns.md` for composition recipes and the full pinch+pan+rotate photo viewer example.

## Layout Animations & List Transitions

The declarative path — use these first, before reaching for custom worklets.

**Mount/unmount animations:**
```tsx
<Animated.View entering={FadeIn.duration(300)} exiting={FadeOut.duration(200)} />
<Animated.View entering={SlideInRight.springify().damping(15)} exiting={SlideOutLeft} />
```

**List reordering:**
```tsx
<Animated.FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  itemLayoutAnimation={LinearTransition.springify()}
/>
```

**Modifiers:** `.duration(ms)`, `.easing(Easing.out(Easing.cubic))`, `.springify()`, `.damping(15)`, `.delay(100)`, `.withCallback(cb)`, `.reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.System)`.

**Shared element transitions** (Reanimated 3+):
```tsx
<Animated.Image sharedTransitionTag="profile-photo" />
```

Shared tags on a source and destination screen automatically animate geometry between them. Requires the navigator to use the native stack.

## Skia for Advanced Motion

Reach for `@shopify/react-native-skia` when RN views can't do the job:

- Charts, graphs, paths, Bézier morphing
- Shaders, blur, color filters, blend modes
- Particle systems, game loops
- Custom gradients and masks
- Animated GIFs with frame control (`useAnimatedImageValue`)

**Interop is seamless in modern Skia + Reanimated.** Skia components accept shared values and derived values directly — no separate `useValue` hook needed:

```tsx
import { Canvas, Circle } from "@shopify/react-native-skia";
import { useDerivedValue, useSharedValue, withRepeat, withTiming } from "react-native-reanimated";

const r = useSharedValue(0);
useEffect(() => {
  r.value = withRepeat(withTiming(85, { duration: 1000 }), -1);
}, []);

return (
  <Canvas style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <Circle cx={128} cy={128} r={r} color="cyan" />
  </Canvas>
);
```

**Time-based animation:** `useClock()` returns a shared value of elapsed milliseconds. Pipe it through `useDerivedValue` for trigonometric or procedural motion.

**Path interpolation:** `usePathInterpolation(progress, [0, 0.5, 1], [pathA, pathB, pathC])` morphs SVG paths as a shared-value progress moves from 0 to 1.

**When not to use Skia:** box-model UI (cards, lists, buttons). Skia runs in its own renderer — you lose accessibility tree integration, native text rendering, and standard touch handling. Use it for the 5% of your app where Reanimated-on-views isn't enough.

See `references/skia-animation-patterns.md` for canvas recipes.

## Performance Rules

Non-negotiables. Violating any of these means a dropped frame somewhere.

1. **Drive animations through shared values, not state.** Never `setState` in an animation loop.
2. **Prefer `transform` and `opacity`.** Reanimated *can* animate `width`, `height`, and `top` off-thread (unlike the legacy Animated API), but transforms are still cheaper and never trigger layout reflow of siblings.
3. **Never mutate a shared value inside `useAnimatedStyle`.** Infinite loop / undefined behavior.
4. **Don't `setState` in `onScroll` or `onGestureEvent`.** Use `useAnimatedScrollHandler` and gesture worklets. When you need JS state, use `useAnimatedReaction` with `runOnJS`.
5. **Gate hover/press state by platform.** `hover` doesn't exist on touch. Use `Pressable` states, gesture handlers, or `scale` feedback.
6. **Fire haptics at commit points, not per frame.** Wrap `Haptics.impactAsync` in `runOnJS` and call it in `onEnd` or threshold-crossing branches.
7. **Profile on mid-tier Android, not the iOS simulator.** The simulator lies. A real Pixel 6a or Samsung A-series tells the truth.
8. **Watch the UI thread frame rate, not just JS.** Perf Monitor shows both. If the UI thread is dropping frames, Reanimated isn't saving you — there's layout or paint work hiding somewhere.

See `assets/performance-checklist.md` for the pre-ship verification list.

## Accessibility: Reduce Motion

This is not a footnote. Users with vestibular disorders enable Reduce Motion to avoid nausea — animations that ignore this setting are a physical accessibility failure.

**`useReducedMotion()`** (from `react-native-reanimated`) — synchronous boolean. Preferred over `AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()` because it works in worklets and doesn't require async.

**`ReducedMotionConfig`** — app-wide component. Place it at the root of the app to globally disable animations when the OS setting is on.

```tsx
import { ReducedMotionConfig, ReduceMotion } from 'react-native-reanimated';

<ReducedMotionConfig mode={ReduceMotion.System} />
```

**`.reduceMotion()` modifier** — per-animation override. Available on all `withTiming`, `withSpring`, and layout animation builders.

```tsx
<Animated.View
  entering={SlideInRight.duration(300).reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.System)}
/>
```

**The decision rule when Reduce Motion is on:**
- **Keep** opacity, color, and fade animations — they convey state without vestibular impact.
- **Remove** translate, scale, rotate, and parallax — collapse to instant or fade.

Example: a slide-up modal becomes a fade-in when Reduce Motion is on. The user still sees the modal appear; they just don't see it travel.

See `references/accessibility.md` for the full matrix. For audit-mode detection of missing reduce-motion checks, cross-reference the `react-native-accessibility` skill's `p2-reduce-motion-ignored` rule.

## Component Patterns

The mobile equivalent of Emil Kowalski's "button responsiveness" section. Lift these directly.

**Pressable scale feedback** (the 160ms "alive" feel):
```tsx
const scale = useSharedValue(1);
const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  transform: [{ scale: scale.value }],
}));

<Pressable
  onPressIn={() => { scale.value = withSpring(0.97, { damping: 20, stiffness: 400 }); }}
  onPressOut={() => { scale.value = withSpring(1, { damping: 20, stiffness: 400 }); }}
>
  <Animated.View style={[styles.button, animatedStyle]} />
</Pressable>
```

**Toast / snackbar:** `entering={SlideInDown.springify().damping(18)}` + `exiting={SlideOutDown.duration(200)}`. Never exceed 300ms on either side.

**Bottom sheet snap:** pan gesture + `withSpring` with velocity: `translateY.value = withSpring(snapPoint, { velocity: event.velocityY, damping: 20, stiffness: 150 })`. Snap points at 0, 0.5, 1 of screen height.

**Pull-to-refresh:** `useAnimatedScrollHandler` reads `event.contentOffset.y`, drives a `useSharedValue` for rubber-band overscroll, fires a refresh via `runOnJS` at threshold.

**Skeleton shimmer:** `withRepeat(withTiming(1, { duration: 1200 }), -1)` drives a `translateX` on a gradient overlay. Skia gives the nicest gradient; Reanimated-on-view works for simpler skeletons.

**Hero / shared element:** `sharedTransitionTag="id"` on source and destination screens. Requires a native stack navigator.

## Anti-Patterns

Short, punchy, often-seen, always wrong.

- **Using the legacy `Animated` API for interactive elements.** It's JS-thread-driven. Use Reanimated.
- **`setState` inside `onScroll` or `onGestureEvent`.** Use worklets + `useAnimatedReaction`.
- **Animating `marginTop` or `top` instead of `translateY`.** Triggers layout reflow.
- **Forgetting the `'worklet'` directive on callbacks passed to gestures.** They run on JS and stutter.
- **Chaining animations with `withTiming(...).then(...)`-style callbacks** when `withSequence` exists.
- **Mutating shared values inside `useAnimatedStyle`.** Undefined behavior.
- **Ignoring `useReducedMotion`.** Physical accessibility failure.
- **Using `LayoutAnimation` from core React Native.** It's JS-thread-driven and uneven across platforms. Use Reanimated layout animations instead.
- **Reaching for Skia for a button press.** Skia is for canvas work, not UI kit polish.
- **Driving a Reanimated animation from a React `useEffect` that depends on a changing prop** without reading from a shared value. You're re-creating the animation every render.

## Review Format

When reviewing existing animation code, output a **markdown table with Before | After | Why columns.** Never use separate "Before:" and "After:" lines — the table makes the tradeoff visible at a glance.

Example:

| Before | After | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| `top: withTiming(100)` | `transform: [{ translateY: withTiming(100) }]` | `top` triggers layout; `translateY` is compositor-only |
| `setState({ x })` in `onUpdate` | `sharedValue.value = e.translationX` | `setState` crosses to JS thread every frame |
| `Animated.timing(...)` (legacy) | `withTiming(...)` (Reanimated) | Legacy API runs on JS thread |
