AI-powered Open Source Intelligence collection and analysis system.

---

## MANDATORY: Use AgentFactory + Task Tool (Constitutional Rule)

**ALL OSINT tasks MUST use AgentFactory.ts to generate the specialist, then spawn via Task.**

### Step 1: Run AgentFactory with OSINT Traits

```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/Agents/Tools/AgentFactory.ts \
  --traits "intelligence,<personality>,<approach>" \
  --task "<task description>" \
  --output json
```

### Workflow → Traits Mapping

| Workflow | Traits | Voice |
|----------|--------|-------|
| UsernameRecon | `intelligence,analytical,exploratory` | Sophisticated |
| DomainRecon | `intelligence,technical,systematic` | Authoritative |
| EmailRecon | `intelligence,analytical,systematic` | Sophisticated |
| SocialCapture | `intelligence,meticulous,thorough` | Sophisticated |
| CompanyProfile | `intelligence,business,synthesizing` | Professional |
| RiskAssessment | `intelligence,security,skeptical` | Intense |
| InfraMapping | `intelligence,technical,thorough` | Authoritative |
| TargetProfile | `intelligence,meticulous,thorough` | Sophisticated |
| InvestigationOrchestrator | `intelligence,systematic,meticulous` | Authoritative |
| CompetitorAnalysis | `intelligence,business,comparative` | Professional |
| CorporateStructure | `intelligence,business,systematic` | Professional |
| FinancialRecon | `intelligence,finance,thorough` | Professional |
| EntityLinking | `intelligence,analytical,synthesizing` | Sophisticated |
| TimelineAnalysis | `intelligence,analytical,systematic` | Sophisticated |
| PhoneRecon | `intelligence,analytical,systematic` | Sophisticated |
| ImageRecon | `intelligence,technical,meticulous` | Authoritative |
| IntelReport | `intelligence,communications,synthesizing` | Authoritative |

## OSINT Agent Role Architecture

**See [docs/AGENT_ROLES.md](docs/AGENT_ROLES.md) for complete agent role reference.**

Quick summary:
- **Tier 1 (Enumeration):** Recon, Scanner, Collector, Enumerator
- **Tier 2 (Analysis):** Analyst, TechAnalyst, FinanceAnalyst, BusinessAnalyst, PatternAnalyst
- **Tier 3 (Correlation):** Linker, Correlator
- **Tier 4 (Assessment):** Auditor, Verifier, Shadow
- **Tier 5 (Synthesis):** Synthesizer, Briefer, Researcher

### Step 2: Spawn via Task Tool

Use the `prompt` field from AgentFactory output:

```
Task tool parameters:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "OSINT [Workflow] Specialist"
  prompt: |
    [AgentFactory prompt output]

    ## Additional Context
    Target: [target]
    Workflow: [Read from skills/osint/Workflows/[Workflow].md]

    ## Tools Available
    - mcp__brightdata__search_engine - platform searches
    - mcp__brightdata__scrape_as_markdown - profile extraction
    - mcp__pai-knowledge__add_memory - store findings (group_id: "osint-[type]")

    ## Voice Output (REQUIRED)
    - Start: 🗣️ Recon: Beginning [type] for [target].
    - Key finding: 🗣️ Analyst: Found [X]. [Insight].
    - End: 🗣️ Analyst: Investigation complete. [Summary].
```

### Why This Pattern?

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Proper voice mapping** | AgentFactory maps traits to correct voice |
| **Consistent agents** | Uses standard agent composition system |
| **SubagentStop fires** | Voice notifications work |

### What is FORBIDDEN

| Action | Why It's Wrong |
|--------|----------------|
| Skipping AgentFactory | No voice mapping, inconsistent agents |
| Main agent executing searches | Bypasses subagent, voice breaks |
| Hardcoding prompts | Should use AgentFactory output |

## Intent Routing

When the user requests OSINT activities, route to the appropriate workflow:

### Username Reconnaissance
**Triggers:** "find username", "check username", "username lookup", "where is this user"
**Workflow:** UsernameRecon.md
```
User: Find all accounts for username "johndoe"
→ Execute UsernameRecon workflow
```

### Domain Reconnaissance
**Triggers:** "domain info", "whois", "dns lookup", "subdomains", "domain recon"
**Workflow:** DomainRecon.md
```
User: Investigate domain example.com
→ Execute DomainRecon workflow
```

### Social Media Capture
**Triggers:** "social media profile", "capture profile", "social intel", "profile analysis"
**Workflow:** SocialCapture.md
```
User: Capture social profile for @target_user
→ Execute SocialCapture workflow
```

User: Investigate with interactive approval
→ Execute InvestigationOrchestrator with require_approval=true
```

**Key Features:**
- Iterative collection that expands as new intelligence is discovered
- Automatic pivot detection (email → domain → company → personnel)
- Interactive mode: user approves/defers each pivot
- Deferred leads stored in Knowledge Graph for future investigation
- Configurable depth limits and scope (narrow/standard/wide)

**Parameters:**
- `max_depth`: Maximum pivot hops (default: 2)
- `max_entities`: Maximum entities before stopping (default: 50)
- `scope`: narrow | standard | wide
- `require_approval`: Ask before each expansion (default: false)

**Resume Investigation:**
```
User: Resume investigation OSINT-INV-2026-001
→ Load deferred pivots from Knowledge Graph, continue investigation
```

## Dependencies

**Required:**
- **pai-agents-skill** - REQUIRED for agent delegation (OSINT tasks must be executed by specialized agents)

**Recommended:**
- **pai-browser-skill** - For web scraping and JavaScript-heavy sites
- **pai-knowledge-system** - For storing entities and relationships to knowledge graph (required for full functionality)

**See [docs/KNOWLEDGE_GROUPS.md](docs/KNOWLEDGE_GROUPS.md) for standard knowledge graph group naming conventions.**

## Ethical Guidelines

Before any OSINT operation:

1. **Verify Authorization** - Ensure you have legitimate purpose
2. **Check Legal Boundaries** - Respect privacy laws and platform ToS
3. **Maintain OPSEC** - Use appropriate anonymization if needed
4. **Document Everything** - Maintain audit trail of collection methods
5. **Store Securely** - Protect collected intelligence appropriately

## Voice Output (REQUIRED)

**All OSINT agents MUST include voice markers for audio notifications.**

The voice system picks up `🗣️` lines and speaks them aloud. Include these at key points:

### Voice Line Format
```
🗣️ [AgentRole]: [Brief status message - max 20 words]
```

### When to Include Voice Lines

| Phase | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Start** | `🗣️ Recon: Beginning username enumeration for target madeinoz.` |
| **Key Finding** | `🗣️ Analyst: Found 5 confirmed accounts. GitHub profile shows developer activity.` |
| **Completion** | `🗣️ Analyst: Investigation complete. 4 distinct entities identified. Awaiting direction.` |

### Agent Role → Voice Mapping

**See [docs/VOICE_MAPPINGS.md](docs/VOICE_MAPPINGS.md) for complete voice reference.**

Voice summary:
- **Sophisticated:** Recon, Analyst, Collector, Enumerator, Linker, Verifier, PatternAnalyst, Correlator
- **Authoritative:** Scanner, TechAnalyst, Synthesizer, Briefer, ImageRecon
- **Professional:** FinanceAnalyst, BusinessAnalyst, Researcher, CompanyProfile
- **Intense:** Auditor, Shadow, RiskAssessment

### Example Output with Voice

```
🗣️ Recon: Initiating username scan for johndoe across 400 platforms.

[... investigation proceeds ...]

🗣️ Analyst: Found 12 accounts. Strong GitHub presence detected.

[... analysis continues ...]

🗣️ Analyst: Investigation complete. Recommend deep dive on developer platforms.
