# Skill: Upgrade Repo

## Purpose

Upgrade language versions, frameworks, and major dependencies safely with a
structured pre/during/post process and a clear rollback plan. The goal is to stay
in control at every step: understand breaking changes before touching code, verify
the build after each fix, and keep commits granular enough that any problem can be
isolated and reverted.

---

## Pre-Upgrade

### 1. Research Before Touching Code

Read the official release notes, migration guide, and CHANGELOG for the new version:
- What is removed or renamed?
- What patterns are deprecated?
- Are there any required migration steps?

Skipping the migration guide is the #1 cause of upgrade pain — breaking changes are
always documented.

### 2. Check Dependency Compatibility

Verify your direct dependencies support the new version. Run your package manager's
outdated/audit command and check whether dependencies need to update alongside the upgrade.

### 3. Assess Scope

Search the codebase for deprecated API usage before starting. This turns vague fear
into a concrete list of files to update and helps you estimate the effort.

### 4. Create a Dedicated Branch and Tag

```bash
git checkout -b upgrade/[name]-[old-version]-to-[new-version]
git tag pre-upgrade-[name]-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin pre-upgrade-[name]-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

The tag is your rollback anchor — push it before making any changes.

## Upgrade Process

### Rule: One Major Version at a Time

Never jump multiple major versions in one step. If upgrading Node 16 → 22,
go 16 → 18 → 20 → 22. Verify tests pass after each step. This isolates which
version introduced each breakage and keeps PRs reviewable.

### Per-Version Steps

1. **Update version** in the manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.)  
   Commit this change before installing so the diff is readable.

2. **Install dependencies** — check the output for conflicts

3. **Fix build errors first** — imports, syntax, renamed APIs — before running tests.  
   Fix in order: import errors → syntax → type errors → API changes.  
   Commit after each logical group of fixes.

4. **Run tests** — fix failures one at a time, commit each fix separately.

5. **Address deprecation warnings** — these become errors in the next major version,
   so clearing them now prevents the next upgrade from being painful.

6. **Commit the working state** before advancing to the next major version.

## Post-Upgrade

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Build succeeds with no errors or unaddressed deprecation warnings
- [ ] Critical user paths tested manually
- [ ] Performance hasn't regressed (startup time, key latencies)
- [ ] Dependencies are compatible with the new version

### Document in `.context/`

Add a decision record at `.context/decisions/upgrade-[package]-[date].md`:

```markdown
# Upgrade [Package] to [New Version]

## Decision
Upgraded from [old] to [new] on [date].

## Rationale
[Why: security fix / new features / dependency requirement]

## Breaking Changes & Mitigations
- [Change]: [how we addressed it]

## Migration Notes
[Patterns that changed; new best practices to follow going forward]

## Rollback
Tag: `pre-upgrade-[name]-[date]`
```

---

## Rollback Procedure

```bash
# Revert to the pre-upgrade state
git checkout pre-upgrade-[name]-[date]
git checkout -b rollback/[package]-[date]

# Restore dependencies and verify
[install command]  # npm install / pip install / etc.
[test command]
```

If the upgrade must be abandoned entirely, delete the upgrade branch and document
the reason in `.context/decisions/`.

---

## Constraints

- Read the migration guide before writing any code
- One major version per upgrade branch — not multiple
- Merge only when all tests are green
- Never upgrade in a production hotfix branch — upgrades need dedicated branches and full testing
- Always tag before upgrading so you can roll back
- Document the rationale — future maintainers need to know why the version changed
