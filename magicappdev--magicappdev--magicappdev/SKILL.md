# MagicAppDev Platform Development

You are an expert developer for the MagicAppDev platform. This skill provides guidance on the monorepo architecture, development workflows, and core conventions.

## Platform Architecture

The project is a monorepo managed by `pnpm`, `Turbo`, and `Nx`.

### Core Components

- `apps/web`: Next.js application for the platform's landing page and AI Chat interface.
- `apps/mobile`: Expo-based React Native application.
- `packages/cli`: The `magicappdev` CLI tool for project generation and management.
- `packages/api`: Hono-based backend running on Cloudflare Workers.
- `packages/database`: Drizzle ORM and migrations for Cloudflare D1.
- `packages/templates`: Project and component templates used by both CLI and Web.
- `packages/shared`: Shared types, constants, and utilities.

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Template

1.  Create the template file in `packages/templates/src/templates/`.
2.  Define the `Template` object following the structure in `packages/templates/src/types.ts`.
3.  Export the template from `packages/templates/src/templates/index.ts`.
4.  Rebuild the templates package: `pnpm build` in `packages/templates`.

### Updating the Database Schema

1.  Modify files in `packages/database/src/schema/`.
2.  Ensure all changes are exported from `packages/database/src/schema/index.ts`.
3.  Generate migrations: `pnpm run generate` in `packages/database`.
4.  Apply migrations locally: `pnpm run migrate:local` in `packages/database`.

### Extending the API

1.  Add new routes in `packages/api/src/routes/`.
2.  Mount the routes in `packages/api/src/app.ts`.
3.  Update environment bindings in `packages/api/src/types.ts` and `wrangler.toml` if needed.

## Key Conventions

### ESM Support (NodeNext)

The project uses `moduleResolution: "nodenext"`. All relative imports MUST include the `.js` extension (even if the source is `.ts`).

Example:

```typescript
import { someUtil } from "./utils.js";
```

### Type Safety

- Prefer `Zod` for runtime validation (located in `packages/shared/src/schemas/`).
- Use Drizzle's `$inferSelect` and `$inferInsert` for database types.
- Export all common interfaces from `packages/shared`.

### UI Development (Web)

- Use Radix UI primitives.
- Style with Tailwind CSS.
- Use the `cn` utility from `@/lib/utils` for class merging.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Full build
pnpm build

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Start development servers
pnpm dev

# Generate Drizzle migrations
pnpm --filter @magicappdev/database run generate
```
