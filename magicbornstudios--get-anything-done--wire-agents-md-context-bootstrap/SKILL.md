# wire-agents-md-context-bootstrap

The entry contract (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md beside a `.planning/` dir) is
the first file every cold agent reads. Phase 11 found that drift between
that file and the live `gad` CLI surface costs ~5-10% of every session
on archaeology before the first real tool call. This skill is the audit
+ patch loop that keeps the entry contract honest.

The skill targets multi-root monorepos where every root needs a
projectid, a canonical CLI surface, and (when multi-agent) a lane map.
For single-root projects, the steps still apply — the lane map collapses
to one paragraph.

**Workflow:** [./workflow.md](./workflow.md)
