5. Highlight what's done well

## Output Format

```markdown
## REVIEW: [Component/Feature name]

**Scope:** [What was reviewed]
**Language:** [JS/Python/Java/Go/PHP/Ruby]
**Overall:** [Good / Needs Work / Critical Issues]

## Review Checklist

### Code Quality (All Languages)
- [ ] No loose typing (no `any`, raw `Object`, `interface{}` abuse)
- [ ] Meaningful names
- [ ] No duplicate code
- [ ] Small functions (< 50 lines)
- [ ] Proper error handling

### Security (All Languages)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets/credentials
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (output escaping)
- [ ] Proper authentication/authorization
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged

### Performance
- [ ] No unnecessary loops/iterations
- [ ] No memory leaks (proper cleanup)
- [ ] Efficient algorithms (avoid O(n²) when O(n) possible)
- [ ] No N+1 queries

### Maintainability
- [ ] Code is self-documenting
- [ ] Complex logic has comments explaining WHY
- [ ] Follows project/language conventions
- [ ] Easy to test (dependencies injectable)

## Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Action Required |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | Security vulnerability, data loss, crash | Must fix before merge |
| **Important** | Bug, bad practice, tech debt | Should fix soon |
| **Minor** | Style, optimization, nice-to-have | Optional improvement |

## Principles

| DON'T | DO |
|-------|-----|
| Only criticize | Balance with positive feedback |
| Be vague ("this is bad") | Be specific with location and fix |
| Focus on style only | Prioritize functionality and security |
| Rewrite everything | Suggest minimal effective changes |
| Skip context | Understand purpose before reviewing |
