# Unity ERP Design Review

Review and apply design standards to: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Your Workflow

1. **Read the target files** — Find and read all files related to `$ARGUMENTS`
2. **Read the supporting reference files** in this skill directory:
   - `design-tokens.md` — Color system, typography, spacing values
   - `components.md` — Component patterns with actual Tailwind classes
   - `principles.md` — Design philosophy and review checklist
3. **Audit the target** against the checklist in `principles.md`
4. **Report findings** — List what's correct, what needs fixing, and what's missing
5. **Apply fixes** if the user asks (or suggest them if reviewing only)

## Key Rules

- Always use semantic color tokens (`text-primary`, `bg-destructive`) — never raw hex/rgb
- Reference `components/ui/page-toolbar.tsx` as the standard page header pattern
- Reference `app/purchasing/page.tsx` as the gold-standard dashboard layout
- Tables should use `px-4 py-2.5` cell padding (not `p-4`) for ERP-appropriate density
- All countable text must use correct pluralization: `${count} item${count !== 1 ? 's' : ''}`
- Mobile views: tables need a `md:hidden` card fallback and `hidden md:block` desktop table
- Status badges must use consistent colors between list and detail views
- Primary actions go in ONE location only (prefer sticky bottom bar on detail pages)

## Output Format

Structure your response as:

### Audit Results
- **Pass** — things that match the design standards
- **Fail** — things that need fixing (with file path and line number)
- **Missing** — patterns that should exist but don't

### Recommended Changes
For each issue, show the specific edit needed with before/after code.
