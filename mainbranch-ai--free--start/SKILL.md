# Start

Single entry point for Main Branch Free. Detect user state, context level, experience — route to the right skill.

**Recommended workflow:** Always start Claude in your Main Branch repo, run `/start`. It handles everything.

---

## CRITICAL: Always Ask Which Repo

**Even if config exists with a saved default, ALWAYS ask the user which repo before proceeding:**

> "Found saved repo:
>
> 1. [saved-repo-name] (saved)
> 2. Switch to different repo
>
> (hit a number)"

Replace `[saved-repo-name]` with the actual folder name from config (e.g., "acme-coaching", "client-project").

**DO NOT skip this question.** Users have multiple repos. The saved default is a suggestion, not automatic.

**Only exception:** User explicitly ran `/start [repo-name]` with a specific path.

---

## Numbered Options Pattern

Always use numbered lists for multi-choice. User replies with just a number.

Apply to: business repo selection, skill routing, any multiple choice.

---

## Detection Flow

```
/start
│
├── Check context level ──────────────→ Fresh? Full load. Heavy? Warn user.
│
├── Pull engine updates ──────────────→ (main-branch, always, silently)
│
├── Load config ──────────────────────→ See [config-system.md](references/config-system.md)
│   ├── ~/.config/main-branch/local.yaml → Default repo + user identity (name, experience)
│   └── [repo]/.main-branch/config.yaml → Team settings, MCP requirements
│
├── MCP pre-flight ───────────────────→ See [mcp-preflight.md](references/mcp-preflight.md)
│   └── Missing required MCP? ────────→ Offer setup or skip
│
├── Find business repo ───────────────→ (from config OR discovery)
│
├── No business repo configured? ─────→ /setup (creates repo, saves path)
│
├── Pull business repo updates ───────→ (your repo, silently)
│
├── Has repo but thin? ───────────────→ /think codify
│   (reference files exist but incomplete)
│
├── Ready to work? ───────────────────→ Route by intent:

│   └── unclear ──────────────────────→ Show options + mention /help
│
└── "confused" / "stuck" ─────────────→ /help
```

## Step -1: Pull Updates

Run `git pull origin main` on the engine repo silently. Mention only if updates pulled. Don't block on network issues.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/mb-free 2>/dev/null && git pull origin main 2>/dev/null || true
```

---

## Step 0: Load Config and Find Business Repo

### Config Reading Flow

```
1. Read ~/.config/main-branch/local.yaml
   ├── Found? → Get default_repo + user identity
   │            Validate path exists and has reference/core/
   │            ├── Valid? → STILL ASK (see below)
   │            └── Invalid? → Clear config, fall to discovery
   └── Missing? → Fall to discovery

2. If repo found, read [repo]/.main-branch/config.yaml
   ├── Found? → Get team settings, MCP requirements
   └── Missing? → Use defaults, offer to create later
```

### CRITICAL: Always Offer Switch Option

**Even with valid config, ALWAYS present numbered options:**

> "Found saved repo:
>
> 1. [saved-repo-name] (saved) <- use this
> 2. Switch to different repo
>
> (hit a number)"

**Why:** Users may have multiple business repos. The saved default is a convenience, not a lock-in. Skipping this question traps users in one repo.

**Only skip the question if:** User explicitly said `/start [repo-name]` with a specific repo.

**Shortcut:** If user says `/start [repo-name]` or mentions a specific repo, validate that path directly with Read. If valid, confirm with user and proceed.

**Config path (fast):** Check `~/.config/main-branch/local.yaml` for `default_repo` and `user.*`. See [config-system.md](references/config-system.md).

**Why Glob fails:** User may have added subdirectories (like `decisions/` or `research/`) as additional working directories, not the parent repo. Glob from the engine can't traverse up to find `reference/core/`.

**Discovery algorithm (when no config):**

1. **Extract parent paths from additional working directories**
   - Look at env info for "Additional working directories"
   - For each path, walk up to find a folder containing `reference/core/`
   - Example: if `main-branch/decisions` is listed, check `main-branch/reference/core/`

2. **Use bash to find repos** (if step 1 fails)
   ```bash
   find ~/Documents/GitHub -maxdepth 3 -type d -name "reference" -exec test -d "{}/core" \; -print 2>/dev/null
   ```

3. **Ask the user** (if nothing found)

**Verify with Read, not Glob:** Once you have a candidate path, use `Read` on `[path]/reference/core/offer.md` to confirm it exists.

**Skip engine** — any path containing `.claude/skills/` is the engine, not a business repo.

**ALWAYS present numbered options** — even with ONE repo found:

> "I found this business repo:
>
> 1. [repo-name]
> 2. Another one (tell me the path)
> 3. Create new (`/setup`)
> 4. I'm confused (`/help`)
>
> Which one? (hit a number)"

**MULTIPLE found:** List all, then options 2-4 above.

**NONE found:** Ask user for path, or route to `/setup`.

### After User Selects Repo

**Offer to save to config:**

> "Want me to save [repo-name] as your default? (faster startup next time)"

If yes, update `~/.config/main-branch/local.yaml`:

```yaml
default_repo: /full/path/to/repo
recent_repos:
  - /full/path/to/repo
user:
  name: "[ask if not set]"
  experience: "[ask if not set]"  # beginner | intermediate | advanced
```

**If user.name or user.experience missing:** Ask once, save for future sessions.

---

## Step 0.5: Pull Business Repo Updates

Once business repo is confirmed, pull its latest updates:

```bash
cd [repo-path] && git pull origin main 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Why both repos:**
- Engine (main-branch) -> new skills, frameworks
- Business repo -> your reference files, decisions, research

If you work across machines or collaborate, your business repo may have changes. Pull them.

**Mention only if updates:** "Pulled latest updates for [repo-name]" — otherwise stay silent.

---

## Step 0.75: Research Tool Detection

After loading config, check available research capabilities:

```bash
# Check what's available (silent checks)
APIFY_OK=$([ -n "$APIFY_TOKEN" ] && echo "1" || echo "0")
GEMINI_OK=$([ -n "$GOOGLE_API_KEY" ] && echo "1" || echo "0")
```

**Report based on experience level:**

| Experience | What to Show |
|------------|--------------|
| `beginner` | "Research ready: Apify for web/YouTube/Instagram." Only mention missing if they ask about research. |
| `intermediate` | Brief status: "Research: Apify ✓, Gemini ✗" |
| `advanced` | Full grid only if relevant to stated task |

**If key tools missing and user mentions research:**

> "Want to add Gemini for deep research? Takes 3 minutes.
> 1. Get key: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
> 2. Add to `~/.config/main-branch/env.sh`
> 3. Restart terminal"

**Don't block or nag.** Apify handles most research needs. Additional tools are opt-in upgrades.

---

## Step 1: Load Business Context

Read these files (in order) to prep Claude:

```
[repo]/CLAUDE.md                    - Business brain
[repo]/reference/core/soul.md       - WHY (philosophy, beliefs)
[repo]/reference/core/offer.md      - WHAT (product, pricing)
[repo]/reference/core/audience.md   - WHO (pains, desires)
[repo]/reference/core/voice.md      - HOW (tone, vocabulary)
```

**Missing files?** Skip silently. If 2+ core files missing -> `/think codify`.

---

## Step 2: Detect State

Check `reference/core/*.md`. No folder -> `/setup`. Exists -> check completeness.

---

## Step 2: Assess Completeness

| File | Complete If |
|------|------------|
| soul.md | >30 lines or "Beliefs" section |
| offer.md | >50 lines or "Price" section |
| audience.md | >30 lines or "Pains" section |
| voice.md | >20 lines or "Tone" section |

2+ empty/missing -> `/think codify`. Complete -> route by intent.

---

## Step 3: Route by Intent

If user is ready to work, ask or infer intent. **Use numbered options:**

> "Your reference files look good. What would you like to do?
>
> 1. Enrich the core (research, decide, mine) -> `/think`
> 2. Add more context -> `/think codify`
> 3. Get help -> `/help`
>
> Looking for ad generation, organic content, video scripts, or landing pages? These are available with Main Branch Premium at skool.com/main-branch
>
> (hit a number to reply, or just tell me what you need)"

If user already stated intent, route directly without asking.

---

## Step 4: Help Mode

"Help" or confused -> route to `/help`. Give quick overview first:

> "1. **main-branch** = engine (skills). 2. **Your repo** = data (offer, audience, voice).
> Daily: `cd main-branch && claude` then `/start`.
> For detailed help: `/help` + your question."

---

## Context Awareness

| Level | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Fresh (0-20%) | Full load, explain briefly |
| Working (20-70%) | Route to task |
| Heavy (70-85%) | Warn: "Finish this, then new session" |
| Critical (85%+) | "Context nearly full. Wrap up." |

Show percentage when relevant: "You're at ~60% — plenty of room."

---

## Adapt to Experience

Read `user.experience` from `~/.config/main-branch/local.yaml` (defaults to `beginner` if missing).

| Experience | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `beginner` | Verbose explanations, show context tips, more hand-holding |
| `intermediate` | Balanced — explain when relevant, skip basics |
| `advanced` | Minimal — get out of the way, route fast |

**First-time** (no config, thin reference): Be verbose, route to /setup
**Returning** (config exists): Quick confirmation, route by intent
**Expert** (advanced experience, clear intent): Get out of the way, route fast

**Updating experience:** If user says "I know what I'm doing" or similar, offer to update their experience level in local.yaml.

## Skill Quick Reference

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| `/start` | Entry point — detects state, routes to the right skill |
| `/setup` | Create business repo from scratch |
| `/think` | Enrich the core — research, decide, codify into reference |
| `/help` | Get answers, troubleshoot, learn |
| `/pull` | Pull latest engine updates |

Looking for ad generation, organic content, video scripts, newsletters, wikis, or landing pages? These are available with Main Branch Premium at skool.com/main-branch

---

## Intent Keywords

Use these to auto-detect what user wants:

| Keywords | Route To |
|----------|----------|
| "help", "confused", "stuck", "don't understand", "how do I" | `/help` |
| "new", "first time", "get started", "set up" | `/setup` |
| "add", "update", "more context", "new testimonials", "enrich" | `/think codify` |
| "research", "decide", "figure out", "explore", "mine", "mining", "transcribe" | `/think` |
| "content strategy", "pillars", "platforms", "cadence", "content plan" | `/think` |
| "pull", "update engine", "get latest" | `/pull` |
| "ads", "copy", "organic", "reels", "tiktok", "vsl", "newsletter", "site", "landing page", "wiki" | Mention Premium: "That skill is available with Main Branch Premium at skool.com/main-branch" |

---

## Remember

Router, not worker. Detect state -> route -> let the target skill do the work. One clarifying question max.

**Three jobs:**
1. Orient Claude to the business (load reference)
2. Understand what user needs (ask if unclear)
3. Route to the right skill (fast)
