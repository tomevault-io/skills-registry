# Skill Creator

Creates properly structured Claude Code skills following Anthropic best practices.

## Skill Structure

```
.claude/skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: Main skill definition
├── REFERENCE.md          # Optional: Detailed API docs
├── EXAMPLES.md           # Optional: Usage examples
└── scripts/              # Optional: Helper scripts
    └── helper.ts
```

## Instructions

When creating a skill:

1. **Choose skill location:**
   - Project: `.claude/skills/` (shared via git)
   - Personal: `~/.claude/skills/` (local only)

2. **Write the SKILL.md frontmatter:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: What it does. USE WHEN trigger phrases. (max 1024 chars)
   allowed-tools: Read, Write, Glob, Bash(command:*)
   ---
   ```

3. **Structure the content:**
   - Quick start section
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Examples with code
   - References to additional docs

4. **Use progressive disclosure:**
   - Main concepts in SKILL.md
   - Details in linked files
   - Keep each file focused

## SKILL.md Template

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: Brief description of capability. USE WHEN user mentions X, Y, OR Z. Additional context about what it provides.
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep

## USE WHEN Format

**Critical:** The description MUST include `USE WHEN` triggers:

```yaml
# Good - clear triggers
description: Generates API routes. USE WHEN user says 'create endpoint', 'add route', OR 'build API'.

# Bad - no triggers
description: Generates API routes for the application.
```

## Skill Discovery

Skills are automatically discovered by Claude when:
1. The skill's `USE WHEN` matches user intent
2. The skill is in a valid location
3. Claude Code has been restarted after creation

## Verify Installation

After creating a skill, restart Claude Code and ask:
```
What skills are available?
```
