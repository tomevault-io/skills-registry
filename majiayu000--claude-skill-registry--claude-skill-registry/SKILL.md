# Regression Analysis & Predictive Modeling

A comprehensive regression analysis skill that automates the complete machine learning workflow from data preparation to model evaluation and interpretation, supporting multiple algorithms and business use cases.

## Instructions

### 1. Data Preparation and Exploration
When users provide datasets for regression analysis:
- Load and validate the data structure and quality
- Handle missing values, outliers, and data type conversions
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Identify potential predictors and target variables
- Support both English and Chinese column names and data

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Date Features**: Extract time-based features from datetime columns
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables to numerical representations
- **Feature Creation**: Generate interaction terms, ratios, and derived features
- **Feature Selection**: Identify most predictive features using statistical methods
- **Data Scaling**: Standardize or normalize features as needed for different algorithms

### 3. Model Training and Selection
- **Linear Regression**: Baseline model with coefficient interpretation
- **Decision Tree Regression**: Non-linear relationships with feature importance
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for improved accuracy and robustness
- **Cross-Validation**: K-fold CV to ensure model stability
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automatic optimization of model parameters
- **Model Comparison**: Rank models by performance metrics

### 4. Model Evaluation and Diagnostics
- **Performance Metrics**: R², MAE, RMSE, MAPE for comprehensive evaluation
- **Residual Analysis**: Diagnostic plots to check model assumptions
- **Learning Curves**: Analyze model performance with different data sizes
- **Feature Importance**: Identify key predictors for business insights
- **Prediction Intervals**: Quantify uncertainty in predictions

### 5. Visualization and Reporting
- **Prediction vs Actual**: Scatter plots showing prediction accuracy
- **Residual Plots**: Diagnostic visualizations for model assumptions
- **Feature Importance Charts**: Visual ranking of predictive factors
- **Learning Curve Analysis**: Model performance visualization
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Automated analysis summary with business insights

## Usage Examples

### Housing Price Prediction
```
Build a model to predict house prices:
[CSV with square_footage, rooms, location, age, amenities data]
```

### Sales Forecasting
```
Create a sales prediction model:
[CSV with date, product_id, marketing_spend, seasonality data]
```

### Risk Assessment
```
Predict risk scores based on customer attributes:
[CSV with demographic, behavioral, historical data]
```

## Best Practices

### Data Preparation
- Ensure consistent data formatting and encoding
- Handle missing values appropriately (imputation vs removal)
- Remove or transform outliers based on domain knowledge
- Validate data types and ranges before modeling

### Model Development
- Always split data into training and testing sets
- Use cross-validation for robust performance estimation
- Compare multiple algorithms before final selection
- Consider business constraints and interpretability requirements

### Interpretation and Deployment
- Focus on business-relevant metrics over purely statistical ones
