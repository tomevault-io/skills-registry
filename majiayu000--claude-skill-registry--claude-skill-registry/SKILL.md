description: Follow Kent Beck's Tidy First principles by strictly separating structural changes from behavioral changes. Use when refactoring code, restructuring code, making structural changes without changing behavior, renaming variables/functions, extracting methods, separating concerns, preparing code for new features, or need to ensure structural and behavioral changes are in separate commits. Use when this capability is needed.

## Instructions
Follow Kent Beck's "Tidy First" approach by strictly separating structural changes from behavioral changes in all development work.

### Core Principle
Separate all changes into two distinct types:

1. **STRUCTURAL CHANGES**: Rearranging code without changing behavior
   - Renaming variables, functions, classes
   - Extracting methods or functions
   - Moving code to different files or modules
   - Reorganizing code structure
   - Improving code organization

2. **BEHAVIORAL CHANGES**: Adding or modifying actual functionality
   - Adding new features
   - Fixing bugs
   - Changing business logic
   - Modifying functionality

### Golden Rules

#### Never Mix Change Types
- **Never mix structural and behavioral changes in the same commit**
- Each commit should be either purely structural OR purely behavioral
- This makes code review easier and debugging simpler

#### Structural Changes First
- **Always make structural changes first when both are needed**
- Tidy the code before adding new behavior
- Prepare the structure to receive new functionality

#### Validate Structural Changes
- **Validate structural changes do not alter behavior**
- Run all tests before making structural changes
- Run all tests after making structural changes
- Tests must pass both before and after - same results
- If behavior changes, it wasn't a pure structural change

### Workflow

#### When Making Structural Changes
1. Ensure all tests are currently passing
2. Make one structural change at a time
3. Run tests to verify behavior unchanged
4. Commit the structural change with clear message
5. Repeat for next structural change if needed

#### When Making Behavioral Changes
1. Complete all structural changes first
2. Commit all structural changes separately
3. Now make behavioral changes
4. Follow TDD cycle (Red → Green → Refactor)
5. Commit behavioral changes separately

### Commit Discipline

#### Commit Message Format
Use the `commit-message` skill format:
- Structural changes: ♻️ refactor or 🧹 tidy
- Behavioral changes: ✨ feat or 🐛 fix

#### Commit Requirements
Only commit when:
1. ALL tests are passing
2. ALL compiler/linter warnings have been resolved
3. The change represents a single logical unit of work

#### Commit Frequency
- Use small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones
- Each structural change gets its own commit
- Each behavioral change gets its own commit

### Code Quality Standards

Apply these principles during structural changes:

- **Eliminate duplication ruthlessly**
  - Look for repeated code patterns
  - Extract common functionality
  - Use DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

- **Express intent clearly through naming and structure**
  - Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes
  - Make code self-documenting
  - Structure code to reveal intent

- **Make dependencies explicit**
  - Clearly show what depends on what
  - Avoid hidden dependencies
  - Use dependency injection where appropriate

- **Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility**
  - Each function/method should do one thing well
  - Follow Single Responsibility Principle
  - Extract large methods into smaller, focused ones

- **Minimize state and side effects**
  - Prefer pure functions when possible
  - Make side effects explicit and controlled
  - Reduce mutable state

### Refactoring Patterns

Use established refactoring patterns with their proper names:

- **Extract Method**: Pull code into a new method
- **Rename**: Change names to better express intent
- **Move Method**: Relocate method to more appropriate class
- **Extract Class**: Split large class into smaller ones
- **Inline Method**: Replace method call with method body
- **Replace Temp with Query**: Replace temporary variable with method
- **Introduce Parameter Object**: Group parameters into object

### Examples

#### Structural Change Example

```go
// Before Refactoring
func CalculateTotal(price float64, taxRate float64) float64 {
    tax := price * taxRate
    return price + tax
}
// After Refactoring - Extract Method
func CalculateTotal(price float64, taxRate float64) float64 {
    tax := CalculateTax(price, taxRate)
    return price + tax
}
func CalculateTax(price float64, taxRate float64) float64 {
    return price * taxRate
}
```

#### Behavioral Change Example

```go
// Before Behavioral Change
func CalculateTotal(price float64, taxRate float64) float64 {
    tax := price * taxRate
    return price + tax
}
// After Behavioral Change - Change Tax Calculation
func CalculateTotal(price float64, taxRate float64) float64 {
    tax := price * taxRate * 1.1 // New tax logic
    return price + tax
}
```

### Benefits

- **Easier code review**: Reviewers can quickly verify structural changes don't alter behavior
- **Safer refactoring**: Tests guarantee no behavior changed
- **Better git history**: Clear separation makes debugging easier
- **Easier rollback**: Can revert behavioral changes without losing structural improvements
- **Lower risk**: Small, focused changes reduce chance of introducing bugs
