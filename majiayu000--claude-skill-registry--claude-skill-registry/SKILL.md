description: Debug Rust ownership, borrowing, and lifetime errors. Use when encountering borrow checker errors (E0382, E0502, E0597, etc.) or when code won't compile due to ownership issues. Use when this capability is needed.

<essential_principles>
The Rust borrow checker enforces memory safety at compile time through three rules:

1. **Each value has exactly one owner** - When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped
2. **You can have either one mutable reference OR any number of immutable references** - Never both simultaneously
3. **References must always be valid** - No dangling references, lifetimes must be sufficient

Understanding these rules is the key to fixing borrow checker errors.
</essential_principles>

<intake>
What would you like help with?

1. Diagnose a borrow checker error (paste the error)
2. Fix a lifetime annotation issue
3. Fix an ownership transfer problem
4. Fix a mutable/immutable borrow conflict
5. Understand a specific error code

**Paste the compiler error or describe the issue, then I'll route to the appropriate workflow.**
</intake>

| Response | Workflow |
|----------|----------|
| Error message pasted, "diagnose", "error", "E0XXX" | `workflows/diagnose-error.md` |
| "lifetime", "'a", "outlives", "E0597", "E0621" | `workflows/fix-lifetime.md` |
| "move", "moved", "ownership", "E0382", "E0507" | `workflows/fix-ownership.md` |
| "borrow", "mutable", "immutable", "E0502", "E0499" | `workflows/fix-borrowing.md` |
| Other | Clarify, then select appropriate workflow |
</routing>

<quick_fixes>
Common solutions for frequent errors:

**E0382 (use of moved value)**: Clone, use references, or restructure to avoid the move
**E0502 (cannot borrow as mutable, already borrowed as immutable)**: Separate the borrows into different scopes, or use interior mutability (RefCell, Mutex)
**E0499 (cannot borrow as mutable more than once)**: Split into separate scopes or use indices instead of references
**E0597 (borrowed value does not live long enough)**: Extend the lifetime of the owner, or use owned types instead
**E0506 (cannot assign, already borrowed)**: Complete borrow before assignment, or use Cell/RefCell
</quick_fixes>

<workflows_index>
| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| diagnose-error.md | Systematically diagnose any borrow checker error |
| fix-lifetime.md | Resolve lifetime annotation issues |
| fix-ownership.md | Fix ownership transfer problems |
| fix-borrowing.md | Handle borrow conflicts |
</workflows_index>

<success_criteria>
A fix is complete when:
- `cargo check` passes without borrow checker errors
- The solution doesn't introduce unnecessary cloning
- The fix maintains the original intent of the code
- Lifetimes are as simple as possible (rely on elision when possible)
</success_criteria>
