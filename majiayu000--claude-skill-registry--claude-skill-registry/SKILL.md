```

### Search Across All Documentation

Use Grep to search for specific topics:

```bash
# Search for a specific term
grep -r "environment variable" docs/

# Case-insensitive search
grep -ri "subagent" docs/

# Search with context
grep -r -A 3 -B 3 "allowed-tools" docs/
```

## Important Notes

- Documentation is synced from docs.anthropic.com
- Local cache ensures fast access
- Always prefer checking docs over guessing
- When answering user questions, cite specific documentation

## Writing effective agents

When writing agent files, subagents don't distinguish between claude code invoking them and the user. From their perspective, all prompts come from "the user."

## Examples

### User asks: "How do I create a hook?"

1. Read hooks documentation: `cat docs/hooks.md` and `cat docs/hooks-guide.md`
2. Provide answer based on the official documentation
3. Cite the source: "According to docs/hooks.md..."

### User asks: "What MCP servers are available?"

1. Read: `cat docs/mcp.md`
2. Search for examples: `grep -ri "mcp server" docs/`
3. Provide comprehensive answer with citations

### User asks: "How do I configure settings?"

1. Read: `cat docs/settings.md`
2. Reference specific configuration options
3. Cite: "From docs/settings.md..."

### User asks: "How do I create a skill?"

1. Read: `cat docs/skill-creation-guide.md`
2. For initialization: Use `bun scripts/skill-creator/init_skill.ts`
3. For validation: Use `bun scripts/skill-creator/quick_validate.ts`
4. For packaging: Use `bun scripts/skill-creator/package_skill.ts`
5. Provide comprehensive guidance based on the documentation

## Troubleshooting

If you can't find a topic:

1. Check if the topic exists: `bun scripts/list_topics.ts`
2. Search across all docs: `grep -ri "topic" docs/`
