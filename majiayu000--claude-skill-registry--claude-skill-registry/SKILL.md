# Spec Authoring Skill

## Purpose

Manage the creation and refinement of feature specifications through the Spec PR process. This skill enables spec-driven development where all changes are defined, reviewed, and approved before implementation begins. Specifications are proposed in the `docs/changes/` directory, reviewed via Pull Request, and merged to `docs/specs/` upon approval.

## When to Use

Use this skill in the following situations:

- Proposing a new feature or significant change
- Defining requirements before implementation
- Creating a Spec PR for team review
- Updating a proposal based on review feedback
- Following the spec-driven development workflow

## Prerequisites

- Project initialized with SynthesisFlow structure (docs/specs, docs/changes directories exist)
- GitHub repository set up
- `gh` CLI tool installed and authenticated

## Spec PR Philosophy

**Specs as Code**: All specification changes follow the same rigor as code changes - proposed via branches, reviewed via PRs, and merged upon approval.

**Benefits**:
- **Review before implementation**: Catch design issues early when changes are cheap
- **Clear requirements**: Implementation has explicit acceptance criteria
- **Historical record**: Approved specs document what was intended and why
- **Team alignment**: Stakeholders review and approve before development starts

**Workflow**:
1. Changes proposed in `docs/changes/` directory (isolated from source-of-truth)
2. Spec PR opened for review
3. Team reviews and provides feedback
4. Proposal refined based on feedback
5. Spec PR approved and merged
6. Approved spec moves to `docs/specs/` (via change-integrator skill)

## The `propose` Command

### Purpose

Create a new change proposal with the necessary file structure.

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Define the Proposal Name

Discuss with the user what feature or change to propose. Choose a clear, descriptive name:
- "User Authentication System"
- "Real-time Notifications"
- "Performance Optimization"

#### Step 2: Run the Helper Script

Execute the script to create the proposal directory structure:

```bash
bash scripts/spec-authoring.sh propose "Feature Name"
```

The script will:
- Convert the name to kebab-case (e.g., "Feature Name" → "feature-name")
- Create `docs/changes/feature-name/` directory
- Create three empty files:
  - `proposal.md` - High-level overview and problem statement
  - `spec-delta.md` - Detailed specifications and requirements
  - `tasks.md` - Breakdown of implementation tasks

#### Step 3: Populate proposal.md

Work with the user to create a clear proposal:

```markdown
# Proposal: Feature Name

## Problem Statement
[What problem does this solve? Why is it needed?]

## Proposed Solution
[High-level approach to solving the problem]

## Benefits
[What value does this provide?]

## Success Criteria
[How do we know this is successful?]
```

#### Step 4: Populate spec-delta.md

Define detailed specifications:

```markdown
# Spec Delta: Feature Name

## Overview
[Detailed description of what's being added/modified/removed]

## Requirements
[Specific, testable requirements]

## Design Decisions
[Key architectural or design choices]

## Migration Path
[How to transition from current state if applicable]
```

#### Step 5: Populate tasks.md

Break down implementation into atomic tasks:

```markdown
# Tasks: Feature Name

## Task 1: Component A
- [ ] Subtask 1
- [ ] Subtask 2

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Criteria 1
- Criteria 2

## Task 2: Component B
...
```

#### Step 6: Create Spec PR

After populating files:

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b spec/feature-name`
2. Add files: `git add docs/changes/feature-name/`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "spec: Propose Feature Name"`
4. Push: `git push -u origin spec/feature-name`
5. Create PR: `gh pr create --title "Spec: Feature Name" --body "..."`

Label as "spec" or "proposal" if labels are available.

## The `update` Command

### Purpose

Fetch review comments from a Spec PR to incorporate feedback.

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Identify the PR Number

Determine which Spec PR needs updates based on review feedback.

#### Step 2: Fetch Review Comments

Run the helper script to view all comments:

```bash
bash scripts/spec-authoring.sh update PR_NUMBER
```

This displays:
- All PR comments with context
- Review feedback from team members
- Suggestions and questions

#### Step 3: Discuss Feedback with User

Review the comments together and determine:
- Which suggestions to incorporate
- What clarifications are needed
- What changes to make to the proposal

#### Step 4: Update Proposal Files

Edit the files in `docs/changes/feature-name/` based on feedback:
- Clarify unclear sections
- Add missing requirements
- Adjust design decisions
- Refine task breakdown

#### Step 5: Push Updates

Commit and push changes to the same branch:

```bash
git add docs/changes/feature-name/
git commit -m "spec: Address review feedback for Feature Name"
git push
```

The Spec PR automatically updates with new changes.

#### Step 6: Request Re-review

If needed, request reviewers take another look at the updated proposal.

## Error Handling

### Proposal Directory Already Exists

**Symptom**: Script reports directory already exists

**Solution**:
- Check if proposal is already in progress: `ls docs/changes/`
- Either use a different name or work with existing proposal
- Consider if this is an update to existing proposal

### Missing GitHub CLI

**Symptom**: `gh: command not found` when using update command

**Solution**:
- Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
- Authenticate: `gh auth login`
- Verify: `gh auth status`

### No Review Comments

**Symptom**: Update command shows no comments

**Solution**:
- Verify PR number is correct
- Check if PR has any comments yet
- Wait for reviewers to provide feedback

## Notes

- **Spec PRs are lightweight**: Focus on clarity over perfection - they can be refined
- **Iterate on feedback**: Multiple rounds of review are normal and healthy
- **Keep proposals focused**: One feature/change per proposal makes review easier
- **Link related work**: Reference existing specs or issues in the proposal
- **The `propose` command only creates structure**: You must populate the files with content
- **Spec PRs merge to main**: After approval, specs become source-of-truth in `docs/specs/`
- **Use change-integrator**: After code PR merges, run change-integrator to move approved specs
