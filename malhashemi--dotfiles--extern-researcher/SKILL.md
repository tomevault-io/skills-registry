# Extern Researcher

## Overview

Enable agents to efficiently study external open-source repositories by leveraging existing
research first, using temporary workspaces for clones, and persisting findings to the global
thoughts system.

## When to Use

- When needing to study patterns or implementations from external repositories
- When checking if a repository has already been researched
- When cloning an external repo for temporary study
- When persisting research findings about external code
- When cleaning up temporary workspace after research is complete

## Key Concepts

### Research-Centric Model

The catalog tracks **research studies**, not cloned repositories. Clones are temporary
workspaces; research is the persistent artifact.

### Directory Structure

The catalog lives inside the org-global `shared/` directory so thoughts-cli can scan it
and it syncs across all projects via the org-global git repo.

```
{thoughtsHome}/{orgGlobal.path}/shared/extern/   # Persistent research storage (canonical)
├── catalog.md                                    # Global research catalog
└── repos/{org-repo}/                             # Research documents per repository

{any-project}/thoughts/global/org/shared/extern/  # Same location via project symlink
{any-project}/.extern/                            # Temporary workspace (disposable)
└── {org-repo}/                                   # Cloned repos for study
```

The script reads `~/.config/thoughts/config.json` to resolve `thoughtsHome` and
`orgGlobal.path` automatically. Default: `~/thoughts/global/shared/extern/`.

### Catalog Format

The catalog uses markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: extern-research-catalog
version: 1.0
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
total_repos_studied: N
total_studies: N

repos:
  - name: "org/repo"
    url: "https://github.com/org/repo"
    first_studied: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    study_count: N
    topics: ["topic1", "topic2"]
---
```

## Scripts

Execute via justfile or directly with uv:

### Via Justfile (Recommended)

```bash
just -f {base_dir}/justfile <recipe> [args...]
```

| Recipe | Arguments | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `list` | | List all research in catalog |
| `search` | `term` | Search catalog by repo or topic |
| `stats` | | Show catalog statistics |
| `add-study` | `repo url topic document context` | Add a new study to catalog |

### Direct Execution

```bash
uv run {base_dir}/scripts/catalog.py <command> [args...]
```

| Command | Arguments | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `list` | | List all research studies |
| `search` | `<term>` | Search by repo name or topic |
| `stats` | | Show catalog statistics |
| `add-study` | `--repo --url --topic --document --context` | Add new study |

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery (ALWAYS FIRST)

Before cloning any repository:

1. **Read the global catalog**: `{thoughtsHome}/global/shared/extern/catalog.md`
2. **Search for the repo** by name, URL, or topic
3. **If found**:
   - Read existing research documents
   - Evaluate: Is this sufficient for current needs?
   - If YES: Use existing research, skip cloning
   - If NO: Proceed to Phase 2, noting what gaps exist
4. **If not found**: Proceed to Phase 2

### Phase 2: Workspace Initialization

If cloning is needed:

1. **Check if `.extern/` exists** in current project
2. **If not, create it**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .extern
   ```
3. **MUST copy AGENTS.md template** to workspace:
   ```bash
   cp {base_dir}/assets/workspace-agents.md .extern/AGENTS.md
   ```
   This provides agent guidance for future sessions working in this directory.
4. **Ensure .gitignore** includes `.extern/`

### Phase 3: Clone Repository

1. **Parse the input** (URL, clone command, org/repo format)
2. **Derive directory name**: `{org}-{repo}` (lowercase, kebab-case)
   - `https://github.com/facebook/react` → `facebook-react`
   - `https://github.com/vercel/next.js` → `vercel-next-js`
3. **Clone with shallow depth** (unless full history needed):
   ```bash
   git clone --single-branch --depth 1 {url} .extern/{org-repo}/
   ```
4. **Verify success**

### Phase 4: Research

1. **Focus on the specific question/topic**
2. **Use appropriate subagents**:
   - `codebase-pattern-finder` - Find implementations, usage examples
   - `codebase-analyzer` - Deep dive on specific components
   - `codebase-locator` - Find files by purpose/feature
3. **Document findings** with file:line references
4. **Note connections** to current project needs

### Phase 5: Persist Research

1. **Create research document**:
   - Location: `{thoughtsHome}/global/shared/extern/repos/{org-repo}/`
   - Filename: `{YYYY-MM-DD}_{topic-slug}.md`
   - Use the research document template below

2. **MUST update global catalog using the script** (not manual file edits):
   ```bash
   just -f {base_dir}/justfile add-study \
     "org/repo" \
     "https://github.com/org/repo" \
     "Topic studied" \
     "repos/org-repo/YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md" \
     "Why this was studied"
   ```
   The script ensures consistent catalog formatting and validates entries.

3. **Sync thoughts** if configured:
   ```bash
   thoughts sync
   ```

### Phase 6: Cleanup (Optional)

When workspace is no longer needed:

1. **Confirm with user** before deletion
2. **Remove .extern/ directory**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .extern/
   ```
3. **Research remains** in `{thoughtsHome}/global/shared/extern/`

## Research Document Template

When creating research documents, use this structure:

```markdown
---
date: {ISO timestamp}
repo: "{org}/{repo}"
url: "{full URL}"
topic: "{research topic}"
context: "{why this was studied}"
project: "{project that prompted this}"
tags: [extern-research, {domain-tags}]
---

# {Topic}: {Repo Name}

## Research Question

{What we set out to learn}

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: {Title}

{Description with code examples and file:line references}

### Finding 2: {Title}

{...}

## Applicable Patterns

{How these findings could apply to our work}

## References

- `{file}:{line}` - {description}
```

## Suitable Subagents

| Agent | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| `codebase-pattern-finder` | Find implementations, usage examples |
| `codebase-analyzer` | Deep dive on specific components |
| `codebase-locator` | Find files by purpose/feature |
| `web-search-researcher` | Additional context about the project |

## Important Constraints

1. **ALWAYS check catalog first** - Never clone without checking existing research
2. **Workspace is temporary** - Do not store valuable data in .extern/
3. **Research is permanent** - Always persist to `{thoughtsHome}/global/shared/extern/`
4. **Update catalog** - Every study must update the global catalog
5. **Respect clone depth** - Use shallow clones unless full history needed
6. **Use org-repo naming** - Include organization to avoid conflicts

## Error Handling

- **Catalog not found** → Auto-created on first `add-study` at `{thoughtsHome}/global/shared/extern/catalog.md`
- **Clone fails** → Check URL format, network, permissions; report to user
- **Research exists but stale** → Proceed with new research, reference existing findings
- **Workspace already exists** → Reuse existing .extern/, check if repo is already cloned
