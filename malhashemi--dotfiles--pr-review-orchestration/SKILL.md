# PR Review Orchestration

## Overview

This skill enables the Planner agent to handle the complete Gemini review cycle for a PR. It provides an automated workflow that:

1. **Waits** for Gemini to post a review (using `await_pr_review` tool)
2. **Assesses** each review thread against actual code (spawns Researcher)
3. **Validates** assessment quality before implementation (spawns Validator)
4. **Implements** approved fixes (spawns Implement)
5. **Responds** to threads and resolves them
6. **Re-reviews** by requesting Gemini to review changes
7. **Loops** until exit condition is met
8. **Escalates** to human for merge decision

## Critical Constraints

### NEVER DO

**NEVER merge PRs**
You are NOT authorized to merge. You MUST escalate to human for merge decisions.
This is non-negotiable. Violation breaks the entire trust model.

**NEVER skip research**
The Researcher MUST spawn sub-agents to read actual code.
Decisions based solely on Gemini's description are FORBIDDEN.

**NEVER trust Gemini blindly**
Gemini lacks project context. All concerns require independent verification.
Your job is to evaluate, not rubber-stamp.

### MUST Follow

- **MUST** write assessment to `thoughts/shared/pr-reviews/{pr}/assessment.md`
- **MUST** spawn Validator after Researcher completes (no skipping the gate)
- **MUST** use `await_pr_review` tool to wait for Gemini (no manual polling loops)
- **MUST** update `thoughts/shared/pr-reviews/{pr}/state.md` after each cycle
- **MUST** escalate to RPIV when ANY exit condition is met:
  - Gemini approves (ready for merge)
  - All items declined/deferred (no code changes made)
  - Timeout waiting for Gemini
  - Context warning received (after completing current cycle)
- **MUST** track iteration count for reporting (no arbitrary limit)

## Workflow Initialization

When entering PR review orchestration, track state:

```
todowrite([
  { id: "prr-init", content: "Initialize PR review state", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "prr-wait", content: "Wait for Gemini review", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "prr-assess", content: "Assess review threads", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "prr-validate", content: "Validate assessment", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "prr-implement", content: "Implement approved fixes", status: "pending", priority: "medium" },
  { id: "prr-respond", content: "Respond to threads", status: "pending", priority: "medium" },
  { id: "prr-rereview", content: "Request re-review", status: "pending", priority: "medium" },
])
```

## Phase: Initialize

Set up tracking variables:

- `iteration_count = 0`
- `context_warning_received = false`
- `pr_number` (from RPIV handoff)
- `owner/repo` (from git remote)
- `worktree_path` (from RPIV handoff)
- `branch` (from RPIV handoff)
- `last_action_time = now()` (ISO timestamp)

Create directory for PR review files:
```bash
mkdir -p thoughts/shared/pr-reviews/{pr_number}
```

**If continuing from handoff**: Read state from `thoughts/shared/pr-reviews/{pr}/state.md` to restore iteration count and last action time.

## Phase: Wait for Gemini Review

Call the `await_pr_review` tool and BLOCK until it returns.

```
await_pr_review({
  pr: {pr_number},
  after: "{last_action_time}",
  timeout_minutes: 120
})
```

The tool will:
1. Poll GitHub for Gemini activity (reviews AND issue comments)
2. When first activity detected, start a 3-minute settling window
3. Collect all activity during the window
4. Return everything collected

**On return, YOU must interpret the results:**

### Step 1: Check Tool Status

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `timeout` | EXIT: Escalate to human with warning |
| `cancelled` | EXIT: Escalate to human |
| `activity_detected` | Continue to Step 2 |

### Step 2: Interpret Collected Data

The tool returns three arrays: `reviews`, `unresolved_threads`, and `issue_comments`.

**Decision tree:**

```
IF unresolved_threads.length > 0:
    -> Continue to ASSESS phase (Gemini has feedback to address)

ELSE IF reviews.length > 0:
    Check the latest review state:
    IF state == "approved":
        -> EXIT: Ready for human merge decision
    ELSE:
        -> EXIT: Ready for human merge decision (reviewed, no threads)

ELSE IF issue_comments.length > 0:
    Read the comment content:
    IF comment says "reviewing" or "will post feedback":
        -> Invoke tool again (Gemini is still processing)
    ELSE IF comment indicates satisfaction ("addressed", "looks good", etc.):
        -> EXIT: Ready for human merge decision
    ELSE:
        -> Invoke tool again (ambiguous, wait for more)

ELSE:
    -> This shouldn't happen with activity_detected status
```

### Key Interpretation Rules

1. **Threads present** = Work to do (always go to ASSESS)
2. **Review only, no threads** = Gemini reviewed but found nothing (exit)
3. **Comment only, no review** = Gemini might be happy OR still processing
   - Read the comment content to decide
   - If unsure, invoke tool again with same timeout
4. **Never skip ASSESS** if there are unresolved threads

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT implement your own polling loop. The tool handles polling and settling.
**CRITICAL**: The tool does NOT interpret Gemini's happiness - YOU must read the comments.

## Phase: Assess Review Comments

Spawn a Researcher agent to independently analyze each unresolved thread.

```
task({
  subagent_type: "researcher",
  description: "PR #{pr_number} review assessment",
  prompt: "<load from references/researcher-prompt.md, substituting variables>"
})
```

**Researcher MUST:**
1. Spawn `codebase-analyzer` for EACH thread to read actual code
2. Understand WHY the code was written this way
3. Evaluate Gemini's concern against reality
4. Recommend: Address | Decline | Defer
5. Write structured assessment to file

**Output**: `thoughts/shared/pr-reviews/{pr}/assessment.md`

## Phase: Validate Assessment

Spawn a Validator agent to review the Researcher's assessment.

```
task({
  subagent_type: "validator",
  description: "PR #{pr_number} assessment validation",
  prompt: "<load from references/validator-prompt.md, substituting variables>"
})
```

**Validator checks:**
- Did Researcher actually verify against code? (evidence required)
- Are Address/Decline/Defer decisions reasonable?
- Are there any obvious errors in judgment?

| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| APPROVED | Continue to IMPLEMENT phase |
| REJECTED | Return to ASSESS with Validator's feedback |

**Track rejection count. If rejection_count > 3, EXIT and escalate to human.**

## Phase: Implement Fixes

If assessment has items marked Address, spawn Implement agent.

```
task({
  subagent_type: "implement",
  description: "PR #{pr_number} review fixes",
  prompt: "<load from references/implement-prompt.md, substituting variables>"
})
```

**Implement agent:**
1. Read approved items from assessment.md
2. Make minimal changes to address each item
3. Run tests and build
4. Commit with message: "Address PR review feedback: {summary}"
5. Push to PR branch
6. Return commit SHA

**If no Address items**: Skip to RESPOND phase.

**Output**: Commit SHA recorded in `thoughts/shared/pr-reviews/{pr}/changes.md`

## Phase: Respond to Threads

For EACH thread in the assessment, use this skill's justfile recipes.

**Justfile**: `{base_dir}/justfile` (reply, resolve, request-review)

**If Address (and implemented):**
```bash
just -f {base_dir}/justfile reply {owner} {repo} {pr} {comment_id} "**Addressed in commit {SHA}**

{Brief description of change}"
just -f {base_dir}/justfile resolve {thread_id}
```

**If Decline:**
```bash
just -f {base_dir}/justfile reply {owner} {repo} {pr} {comment_id} "**Declined**

{Rationale from assessment - WHY this is by design or incorrect}"
just -f {base_dir}/justfile resolve {thread_id}
```

**If Defer:**

You MUST create a GitHub issue to track the deferred work. Use `gh issue create` directly:

```bash
# Step 1: Create the issue and capture the issue number
gh issue create \
  --title "Type Safety: {brief description of deferred item}" \
  --body "## Deferred from PR #{pr_number}

**Original thread**: {file}:{line}
**Gemini severity**: {severity}

### Issue
{Description of the type safety or other concern}

### Why Deferred
{Rationale - e.g., fix requires cascading changes, exceeds PR scope}

### Proposed Fix
{What needs to be done}

### References
- PR: #{pr_number}
- Thread: {link to comment}" \
  --label "deferred"
```

The command will output the issue URL. Extract the issue number from it.

```bash
# Step 2: Reply to the thread with the issue number
just -f {base_dir}/justfile reply {owner} {repo} {pr} {comment_id} "**Deferred**: Tracked in #{issue_number}

{Brief rationale for deferral}"

# Step 3: Resolve the thread
just -f {base_dir}/justfile resolve {thread_id}
```

**IMPORTANT**: You must create the issue FIRST to get the issue number. Do not reply with "follow-up ticket" or similar vague language - always include the actual issue number.

**CRITICAL**: Always resolve threads after replying. Unresolved threads = incomplete work.

## Phase: Request Re-Review

After all threads are responded to and resolved:

```bash
just -f {base_dir}/justfile request-review {owner} {repo} {pr} "## Review Feedback Summary

@gemini-code-assist All feedback has been addressed.

| Thread | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| {path}:{line} | Fixed | Commit {sha} |
| {path}:{line} | Declined | {reason} |
| {path}:{line} | Deferred | Issue #{num} |

Please re-review the changes."
```

**After requesting re-review:**
1. Increment `iteration_count`
2. Update `last_action_time = now()`
3. Update state file (see State File Format below)
4. **Check for context warning**: If you received a context threshold warning during this cycle:
   - Set `context_warning_received = true`
   - EXIT with CONTEXT_HANDOFF report (see below)
5. **MANDATORY: Return to WAIT phase and call `await_pr_review`**

---

## CRITICAL: You MUST Wait for Gemini

**Do NOT check thread counts yourself to determine completion.**

The ONLY way to know if review is complete:
1. Call `await_pr_review` after requesting re-review
2. Interpret Gemini's response (see WAIT phase decision tree)

| ❌ WRONG | ✅ RIGHT |
|----------|----------|
| "I resolved all threads, so I'm done" | "I resolved threads, requested re-review. Now I WAIT for Gemini." |
| Checking `isResolved` status yourself | Using `await_pr_review` to get Gemini's response |
| Exiting because thread count is 0 | Exiting because `await_pr_review` says Gemini approved |

**Why this matters**: Gemini may post NEW threads after you resolve previous ones. Only the `await_pr_review` tool can tell you if Gemini is truly satisfied with the changes.

---

## Context Warning Handling

The context monitor plugin will inject a warning message when context reaches 60%:
> "STOP IMMEDIATELY. Context threshold (60%) reached..."

**When you receive this warning:**
1. **Do NOT stop mid-cycle** - Complete through RE-REVIEW phase
2. After RE-REVIEW, update state file with current progress
3. EXIT with CONTEXT_HANDOFF status (not an error - this is normal)
4. RPIV will spawn a fresh instance to continue

This ensures work is never lost and handoffs happen at clean boundaries.

## State File Format

Update after each cycle: `thoughts/shared/pr-reviews/{pr}/state.md`

```markdown
# PR #{pr_number} Review State

**Last Updated**: {ISO timestamp}
**Iteration**: {count}
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS | WAITING_FOR_GEMINI | COMPLETE | HANDOFF

## Progress
- Threads total: {n}
- Addressed: {n}
- Declined: {n}
- Deferred: {n}

## Last Action
- Type: RE_REVIEW_REQUESTED | WAITING | ASSESSING
- Time: {ISO timestamp}
- After: {timestamp to use for await_pr_review}

## Commits This Session
- `{sha}`: {message}
```

## Exit Conditions

**All exits (except context warning) are triggered by `await_pr_review` results:**

| Condition | Detection via `await_pr_review` | Action |
|-----------|--------------------------------|--------|
| Gemini approves | Returns with 0 `unresolved_threads` and review state is `approved` | Exit -> COMPLETE report |
| Gemini satisfied | Returns with 0 `unresolved_threads` (no new feedback) | Exit -> COMPLETE report |
| All declined/deferred | You declined/deferred all threads, then `await_pr_review` shows no new threads | Exit -> COMPLETE report |
| Timeout | Returns `status: "timeout"` | Exit -> TIMEOUT report |
| Context warning | Received 60% threshold warning (NOT from await_pr_review) | Exit -> CONTEXT_HANDOFF report |
| Validator rejects 3x | `rejection_count > 3` | Exit -> ERROR report |

**Key point**: Even if YOU resolved all threads, you must still call `await_pr_review` to confirm Gemini doesn't post new ones.

## Report Formats

When exiting, return structured report to RPIV based on exit condition:

### COMPLETE Report (Ready for merge / No changes)

```markdown
PR_REVIEW_COMPLETE

PR: #{pr_number}
Status: READY_FOR_MERGE | NO_CHANGES_NEEDED
Iterations: {count}

Summary:
- Threads assessed: {n}
- Addressed: {n}
- Declined: {n}  
- Deferred: {n}
- Commits: {n}

Files:
- Assessment: thoughts/shared/pr-reviews/{pr}/assessment.md
- Changes: thoughts/shared/pr-reviews/{pr}/changes.md
- State: thoughts/shared/pr-reviews/{pr}/state.md
```

### CONTEXT_HANDOFF Report (Context warning received)

**This is not an error** - it's a normal handoff for continuation.

```markdown
PR_REVIEW_HANDOFF

PR: #{pr_number}
Status: CONTEXT_LIMIT_REACHED
Iterations: {count}
Reason: Context threshold (60%) reached after completing cycle {n}

Current State:
- Phase: WAITING_FOR_GEMINI (clean handoff point)
- Last action: RE_REVIEW_REQUESTED at {timestamp}
- After timestamp: {timestamp for next await_pr_review}

Progress So Far:
- Threads assessed: {n}
- Addressed: {n}
- Declined: {n}

Recommendation: Spawn fresh instance to continue.
State file: thoughts/shared/pr-reviews/{pr}/state.md
```
