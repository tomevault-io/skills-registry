# PR Review

## Overview

This skill enables efficient handling of GitHub Pull Request review workflows. It provides
Python scripts (via `uv run`) managed through a justfile for all GitHub API interactions,
along with structured workflows for analyzing, categorizing, and responding to review comments.

## When to Use

- User invokes `/pr-review` command
- Request to address PR feedback or review comments
- Need to respond to @gemini-code-assist review
- Requirement to resolve review threads or request re-review
- Request to merge PR after addressing feedback

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Command/Tool | Flow |
|-------|--------|--------------|------|
| 1 | Gather | `just -f {base_dir}/justfile unresolved OWNER REPO PR` | Autonomous |
| 2 | Research | `session({mode: "message", agent: "researcher", ...})` | **⏸️ CHECKPOINT** |
| 3 | Plan | `session({mode: "message", agent: "planner", ...})` | Autonomous ↓ |
| 4 | Implement | `session({mode: "message", agent: "implement", ...})` | Autonomous ↓ |
| 5 | Respond | `just reply ...` + `just resolve ...` | Autonomous ↓ |
| 6 | Finalize | `just request-review ...` or `just merge ...` | Autonomous ↓ |

> **Flow Model**: Phase 1 runs autonomously. Phase 2 ends with a checkpoint for user approval.
> After approval, Phases 3-6 execute as an autonomous chain with no additional user interaction.

## Workflow Initialization

**IMMEDIATELY upon loading this skill**, create the todo list to track all phases:

```
todowrite([
  { id: "pr-1", content: "Phase 1: Gather PR review data (autonomous)", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "pr-2", content: "Phase 2: Research & assess comments (⏸️ CHECKPOINT)", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "pr-3", content: "Phase 3: Create implementation plan (autonomous)", status: "pending", priority: "medium" },
  { id: "pr-4", content: "Phase 4: Execute implementation (autonomous)", status: "pending", priority: "medium" },
  { id: "pr-5", content: "Phase 5: Respond to review threads (autonomous)", status: "pending", priority: "medium" },
  { id: "pr-6", content: "Phase 6: Finalize and request re-review (autonomous)", status: "pending", priority: "medium" }
])
```

**Phase Execution Pattern**:
1. Mark phase as `in_progress` when starting
2. Mark phase as `completed` when done
3. For CHECKPOINT phases: stop after presenting results, wait for user approval
4. For autonomous phases: immediately proceed to next phase after completion

## Scripts

All scripts are PEP 723 compliant Python files. The base directory for this skill is provided
when loaded. All scripts output JSON for easy parsing. Execute via justfile or directly with uv:

### Via Justfile (Recommended)

```bash
just -f {base_dir}/justfile <recipe> [args...]
```

| Recipe | Arguments | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `pr-info` | `[pr_number]` | Get PR metadata (auto-detects if omitted) |
| `fetch-comments` | `owner repo pr_number` | Fetch inline review comments |
| `fetch-threads` | `owner repo pr_number` | Fetch threads with resolution status |
| `unresolved` | `owner repo pr_number` | Fetch only unresolved threads |
| `full-review` | `owner repo pr_number` | Get all PR data (info + threads + comments) |
| `reply` | `owner repo pr_number comment_id body` | Reply to a comment |
| `resolve` | `thread_id` | Resolve a thread by GraphQL ID |
| `request-review` | `owner repo pr_number body` | Post summary and request re-review |
| `merge` | `pr_number [method]` | Merge PR (method: merge/squash/rebase) |

### Direct Execution

```bash
uv run {base_dir}/scripts/<script>.py [args...]
```

| Script | Arguments | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `get_pr_info.py` | `[pr_number]` | Get PR metadata (auto-detects if omitted) |
| `fetch_pr_comments.py` | `owner repo pr_number` | Fetch inline review comments |
| `fetch_review_threads.py` | `owner repo pr_number` | Fetch threads with resolution status |
| `reply_to_comment.py` | `owner repo pr_number comment_id body` | Reply to a comment |
| `resolve_thread.py` | `thread_id` | Resolve a thread by GraphQL ID |
| `request_review.py` | `owner repo pr_number body` | Post summary and request re-review |
| `merge_pr.py` | `pr_number [method]` | Merge PR (method: merge/squash/rebase) |

### Examples

```bash
# Via justfile
just -f {base_dir}/justfile pr-info 123
just -f {base_dir}/justfile fetch-threads owner repo 123
just -f {base_dir}/justfile unresolved owner repo 123

# Direct execution
uv run {base_dir}/scripts/get_pr_info.py 123
uv run {base_dir}/scripts/fetch_review_threads.py owner repo 123
```

## Multi-Agent Workflow

This skill orchestrates multiple specialized agents for thorough PR review analysis:

| Agent | Role | When Used |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **researcher** | Deep codebase analysis, independent assessment | Phase 2: Evaluates each comment against actual code |
| **planner** | Creates implementation plan | Phase 3: Plans approved changes |
| **implement** | Executes the plan | Phase 4: Makes code changes |

### Decision Categories

The researcher agent will recommend one of these for each comment:

| Category | Criteria | Response Template | Resolution |
|----------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| **✅ Address** | Valid concern, within PR scope, clear improvement | `✅ **Addressed in commit {SHA}**\n\n{Details}` | Reply + Resolve |
| **❌ Decline** | Invalid, by design, project-specific exception, or Gemini missing context | `❌ **Declined**: {Reasoning}` | Reply + Resolve |
| **⏸️ Defer** | Valid but out of PR scope, belongs in separate PR/issue | `⏸️ **Deferred**: Tracked in #{issue}` | Create Issue → Reply → Resolve |

### Priority Badge Reference

Gemini uses badge images to indicate its priority assessment (note: these reflect Gemini's view, not objective truth):

| Badge in Body | Gemini's Priority | Recommended Action |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `critical.svg` | Critical | Evaluate independently - may still decline |
| `high-priority.svg` | High | Evaluate independently |
| `medium-priority.svg` | Medium | Evaluate independently |
| `low-priority.svg` | Low | Often safe to defer |

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Gather (autonomous)

**Todo**: Mark `pr-1` as `in_progress`

1. Determine PR number (from user request or auto-detect)
2. Extract OWNER/REPO from git remote: `git remote get-url origin`
3. Execute:
   ```bash
   just -f {base_dir}/justfile fetch-threads OWNER REPO PR_NUMBER
   just -f {base_dir}/justfile fetch-comments OWNER REPO PR_NUMBER
   ```
   Or use `unresolved` recipe to get only unresolved threads:
   ```bash
   just -f {base_dir}/justfile unresolved OWNER REPO PR_NUMBER
   ```
4. Parse results to identify unresolved threads
5. Check for already-responded threads (threads with prior `✅`/`❌`/`⏸️` responses that remain unresolved only need resolution, not re-assessment)

**Todo**: Mark `pr-1` as `completed`, mark `pr-2` as `in_progress`

**Flow**: AUTONOMOUS → proceed immediately to Phase 2

---

### Phase 2: Research & Assess (⏸️ CHECKPOINT)

Delegate deep analysis to the researcher agent using the session tool:

```
session({
  mode: "message",
  agent: "researcher",
  text: "<use Researcher Prompt Template from {base_dir}/references/agent-prompts.md>"
})
```

The researcher will:
1. Understand the PR's intended scope and purpose
2. Research the codebase for each comment's technical validity
3. Check for project-specific patterns Gemini might have missed
4. Return independent recommendations (✅ Address, ❌ Decline, ⏸️ Defer) with evidence

#### ⏸️ CHECKPOINT: User Approval Required

Present researcher's analysis and **wait for explicit approval** before proceeding.

User options:
- Approve all recommendations as-is
- Override specific decisions (e.g., "address #3 even though researcher said decline")
- Request more research on specific items

**Todo**: Mark `pr-2` as `completed` only AFTER user approves

**Flow**: CHECKPOINT → wait for user approval, then proceed autonomously through Phases 3-6

> **IMPORTANT: Autonomous Flow After Approval**
> 
> This is the ONLY checkpoint in the workflow. Once the user approves the researcher's
> analysis, the orchestrating agent MUST proceed autonomously through Phases 3-6 without
> stopping for additional user input. Update todos as each phase completes.

---

### Phase 3: Plan (autonomous)

**Todo**: Mark `pr-3` as `in_progress`

After user approves the analysis, delegate to planner for items marked "Address":

```
session({
  mode: "message",
  agent: "planner",
  text: "<use Planner Prompt Template from {base_dir}/references/agent-prompts.md>"
})
```

The planner will:
1. Analyze each approved item's requirements
2. Determine the minimal changes needed
3. Create a step-by-step implementation plan
4. Define verification steps for each change

**Todo**: Mark `pr-3` as `completed`

**Flow**: AUTONOMOUS → proceed immediately to Phase 4

---

### Phase 4: Implement (autonomous)

**Todo**: Mark `pr-4` as `in_progress`

Execute the plan from Phase 3:

```
session({
  mode: "message",
  agent: "implement",
  text: "<use Implement Prompt Template from {base_dir}/references/agent-prompts.md>"
})
```

The implement agent will:
1. Execute each step of the plan
2. Verify changes address the specific issues
3. Run tests and build
4. Commit and push changes
5. Report back with commit SHA

**Todo**: Mark `pr-4` as `completed`

**Flow**: AUTONOMOUS → proceed immediately to Phase 5

---

### Phase 5: Respond (autonomous)

**Todo**: Mark `pr-5` as `in_progress`

All categories are resolved after proper handling.

For addressed comments:
```bash
just -f {base_dir}/justfile reply OWNER REPO PR_NUMBER COMMENT_ID "✅ **Addressed in commit SHA**..."
just -f {base_dir}/justfile resolve THREAD_ID
```

For declined comments:
```bash
just -f {base_dir}/justfile reply OWNER REPO PR_NUMBER COMMENT_ID "❌ **Declined**: Reasoning"
just -f {base_dir}/justfile resolve THREAD_ID
```

For deferred comments:
1. Create GitHub issue with `deferred` label (see `{base_dir}/references/deferred-workflow.md`)
2. Reply with issue link: `⏸️ **Deferred**: Tracked in #{issue_number}`
3. Resolve thread

**Note**: Threads with existing responses from prior review cycles only need resolution—skip the reply step.

**Todo**: Mark `pr-5` as `completed`

**Flow**: AUTONOMOUS → proceed immediately to Phase 6

---

### Phase 6: Finalize (autonomous)

**Todo**: Mark `pr-6` as `in_progress`

If comments were addressed:
```bash
just -f {base_dir}/justfile request-review OWNER REPO PR_NUMBER "## Review Feedback Summary

@gemini-code-assist All feedback addressed.

| # | Issue | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Description | ✅ Fixed in abc123 |

Please re-review."
```

If all declined/deferred (no code changes):
- Post summary comment documenting decisions
- No re-review needed

**Todo**: Mark `pr-6` as `completed`

**Flow**: AUTONOMOUS → workflow complete, present summary to user

#### Plan Reconciliation (if applicable, autonomous)

Before merge, if PR implements a plan from `thoughts/`:
1. Compare implementation (`git diff {baseRefName}...HEAD`) against plan phases
2. Correct any plan details that don't match reality
3. Mark completed phases as done

If plan location is unknown, ask user. Skip if no associated plan.

See `{base_dir}/references/plan-reconciliation.md` for detailed workflow.

#### Merge (optional, autonomous)

After review cycle complete (and plan reconciled if applicable):
```bash
just -f {base_dir}/justfile merge PR_NUMBER squash
```

Only merge if user explicitly requested it or if standard practice for the project.

## Agent Prompt Templates

Templates for delegating to specialized agents are in `{base_dir}/references/agent-prompts.md`:

| Template | Used In | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Researcher** | Phase 2 | Deep codebase analysis, independent assessment of each comment |
| **Planner** | Phase 3 | Creates minimal implementation plan for approved items |
| **Implement** | Phase 4 | Executes plan, runs tests, commits and pushes |

Read the templates file when preparing session handoffs to each agent.

## Error Handling

- **GitHub CLI auth failure**: Run `gh auth status` to verify authentication
- **PR not found**: Provide explicit PR number if auto-detect fails
- **GraphQL errors**: Verify thread ID format (should start with `PRRT_`)
- **Script errors**: Check `uv` is installed and available in PATH
- **"not a git repository" error**: Justfile recipes that need git context (pr-info, merge, full-review) automatically run from the caller's directory. When running scripts directly, ensure execution is within a git repository
- **Body quoting issues**: For complex bodies with special characters, use direct `gh api` calls as an escape hatch (bypasses skill scripts):
  ```bash
  # Reply to comment with complex body
  gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR/comments \
    -f body=$'✅ **Addressed**\n\nDetails here' \
    -F in_reply_to=COMMENT_ID
  
  # Post PR comment
  gh pr comment PR --body "Simple message"
  ```
