## CPU Architecture

### vCPU:pCPU Ratio

The vCPU:pCPU ratio emerges from cumulative CPU allocation decisions—it's not a single configurable setting.

**How the ratio is determined:**

- **VM-level CPU assignment**: Each VM's vCPU count (Edit Settings > CPU). Sum all vCPUs across VMs divided by physical cores = ratio
- **Resource pool reservations/limits**: Reservations guarantee minimum CPU; limits cap maximum. These influence scheduler aggressiveness during contention
- **CPU scheduler**: VMkernel distributes vCPU load across pCPUs using ready time and co-stop metrics. Not directly configurable
- **CPU affinity (optional)**: Pin vCPUs to specific pCPUs, controlling local scheduling ratios for latency-sensitive workloads
- **Power management**: Fewer active cores with power management enabled implicitly increases ratio

**Enterprise guidance:**

| Workload Type | Recommended Ratio | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| General purpose | 4:1 to 6:1 | Default for mixed workloads |
| CPU-intensive | 2:1 to 3:1 | Databases, analytics, compilation |
| VDI | 6:1 to 8:1 | Bursty, non-concurrent usage |
| Dev/Test | 8:1 to 10:1 | Tolerates contention |

**Validation metrics:**

- **CPU Ready** > 5% sustained = ratio too aggressive
- **Co-stop** > 3% = too many vCPUs per VM for workload
- **%USED** approaching 80% = add capacity

### CPU Ready vs Co-Stop

**CPU Ready**: Time a vCPU waits in run queue because no pCPU is available. Indicates host-level oversubscription.

**Co-Stop**: Time a vCPU waits for sibling vCPUs to be scheduled together (SMP VMs). Indicates the VM has more vCPUs than it can efficiently use.

```
# esxtop CPU view
Press 'c' for CPU view
Key columns: %RDY, %CSTP, %USED, %MLMTD
```

**Troubleshooting flow:**
1. High Ready + Low Co-stop → Host oversubscribed, reduce total vCPUs or add hosts
2. High Co-stop + Normal Ready → VM has too many vCPUs, reduce VM's vCPU count
3. High Ready + High MLMTD → Resource pool limit hit, raise limit or reservation

For detailed CPU scheduler internals, see [references/cpu-scheduler.md](references/cpu-scheduler.md).

## Memory Architecture

### Memory Reclamation Hierarchy

ESXi reclaims memory in this order (least to most disruptive):

1. **Transparent Page Sharing (TPS)** - Deduplicates identical pages. Salted by default for security (only intra-VM)
2. **Ballooning** - Guest driver (vmmemctl) requests memory from guest OS. Requires VMware Tools
3. **Compression** - Compresses pages before swapping. 4KB → typically 2KB
4. **Swapping** - Host swaps VM pages to disk. Severe performance impact

**State thresholds:**

| State | Free Memory | Techniques Active |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| High | > 6% | None |
| Soft | 4-6% | TPS, Balloon |
| Hard | 2-4% | TPS, Balloon, Compression |
| Low | < 2% | All including Swap |

**Memory metrics:**

- **MCTLSZ**: Balloon driver target size (MB)
- **SWCUR**: Current swap usage (MB)
- **CACHEUSD**: Compressed memory cache (MB)
- **%ACTV**: Actively used memory percentage

### Memory Overcommitment

Unlike CPU, memory overcommitment has severe performance implications when reclamation occurs.

**Conservative approach**: Size memory to 80% utilization with no overcommitment for production workloads.

**Aggressive approach**: 1.2:1 to 1.5:1 overcommitment acceptable if:
- VMware Tools installed (ballooning works)
- Guest OS can handle balloon requests
- SSD-backed swap file configured
- Non-latency-sensitive workloads

For memory sizing patterns, see [references/memory-sizing.md](references/memory-sizing.md).

## Storage Architecture

### Datastore Types

| Type | Use Case | Max Size | Pros | Cons |
|------|----------|----------|------|------|
| VMFS 6 | Block storage | 64TB | Mature, flexible | Requires SAN |
| NFS v3/v4.1 | File storage | Array limit | Simple, thin | Network dependent |
| vSAN | HCI | Cluster-wide | Integrated, policy-based | Requires local disks |
| vVols | Policy-based | Array limit | Granular control | Array support required |

### VMDK Types

- **Thick Eager Zeroed**: Best performance. Space allocated and zeroed at creation. Required for FT, MSCS
- **Thick Lazy Zeroed**: Space allocated, zeroed on first write. Good balance
- **Thin**: Space allocated on write. Best capacity. Performance penalty on first writes

### vSAN Architecture

**Requirements per host:**
- Minimum 1 SSD (cache tier) + 1 capacity device
- 10GbE minimum (25GbE recommended)
- VMkernel port group for vSAN traffic

**Design considerations:**
- FTT (Failures to Tolerate): Defines replica count. FTT=1 requires 3+ hosts
- Stripe width: Spreads I/O across disks for performance
- Deduplication/Compression: Reduce capacity, adds CPU overhead

For storage design patterns, see [references/storage-patterns.md](references/storage-patterns.md).

## DRS and Resource Pools

### DRS Automation Levels

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Manual | Recommendations only, no automatic moves |
| Partially Automated | Initial placement automatic, migrations manual |
| Fully Automated | All placement and migrations automatic |

**Migration threshold** (1-5):
- Level 1: Priority 1 recommendations only (mandatory moves)
- Level 5: All recommendations including minor improvements

### Resource Pool Design

Resource pools partition cluster resources. Key settings:

- **Reservation**: Guaranteed minimum resources
- **Limit**: Maximum resources (default unlimited)
- **Shares**: Relative priority during contention (Low/Normal/High/Custom)

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Deeply nested pools (>3 levels)
- Reservations that exceed physical capacity
- Mixing VMs directly in cluster with resource pools

### Affinity Rules

| Rule Type | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| VM-VM Affinity | Keep VMs together | App + DB on same host for latency |
| VM-VM Anti-affinity | Separate VMs | HA cluster nodes on different hosts |
| VM-Host Affinity | Prefer hosts | License-bound software |
| VM-Host Anti-affinity | Avoid hosts | Keep prod off dev hardware |

**Required vs Preferred:**
- **Required (must)**: DRS won't violate. Can prevent HA failover
- **Preferred (should)**: DRS tries but will violate if necessary

For DRS tuning patterns, see [references/drs-tuning.md](references/drs-tuning.md).

## High Availability

### HA Admission Control

**Policies:**

| Policy | Behavior | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Host failures cluster tolerates | Reserve capacity for N host failures | Predictable sizing |
| Percentage of cluster resources | Reserve X% CPU/memory | Flexible environments |
| Dedicated failover hosts | Specific hosts as standby | Compliance requirements |

**Slot calculation** (for host failures method):
- Slot size = Largest VM reservation (or 32MHz CPU, 128MB memory if no reservations)
- Total slots = Sum of slots per host
- Available slots = Total - (N hosts worth of slots)

**Warning**: Large reservation on single VM can inflate slot size, wasting capacity.

### Fault Tolerance

**FT requirements:**
- Thick eager-zeroed disks
- vSphere FT logging network (10GbE minimum)
- Same CPU family primary/secondary
- Max 8 vCPUs per FT VM

**FT vs HA:**
- FT: Zero downtime, synchronous replication, significant resource overhead
- HA: Restart after failure, seconds of downtime, minimal overhead

For HA design patterns, see [references/ha-patterns.md](references/ha-patterns.md).

## Capacity Planning

### Sizing Methodology

1. **Inventory workloads**: Document CPU, memory, storage, network requirements
2. **Determine ratios**: Based on workload type (see CPU section)
3. **Calculate raw requirements**: Sum all resources
4. **Add HA overhead**: N+1 or N+2 based on SLA
5. **Add growth buffer**: Typically 20-30% for 12-18 months
6. **Validate with metrics**: Deploy, monitor, adjust

### Quick Sizing Formulas

**Hosts needed (N+1 HA):**
```
Hosts = ceiling((Total vCPUs / (Cores per Host × vCPU Ratio)) + 1)
```

**Memory calculation:**
```
Memory per Host = (Total VM Memory / Hosts) × 1.1 (10% ESXi overhead)
```

**Example**: 100 VMs, average 4 vCPU and 16GB RAM each
- Total vCPUs: 400
- Host: 32 cores, 4:1 ratio → 128 vCPUs per host
- Compute hosts: ceiling(400/128) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 hosts
- Memory per host: (100 × 16GB / 5) × 1.1 = 352GB → 384GB config

### Critical Thresholds

| Metric | Warning | Critical | Action |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| CPU %RDY | >5% | >10% | Reduce oversubscription |
| CPU %CSTP | >3% | >5% | Reduce VM vCPU count |
| MEM %ACTV | >80% | >90% | Add memory or reduce VMs |
| KAVG (disk latency) | >20ms | >30ms | Check storage path |
| DAVG (device latency) | >20ms | >30ms | Storage array issue |
| %DRPTX/%DRPRX | >0.1% | >1% | Network saturation |

### Common Issues and Fixes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| High Ready across all VMs | Host oversubscribed | Add hosts, reduce vCPUs |
| High Ready on specific VMs | Resource pool limit | Raise limit/reservation |
| High Co-stop | Too many vCPUs | Reduce VM's vCPU count |
| Ballooning active | Memory pressure | Add RAM or reduce VMs |
| KAVG >> DAVG | HBA/path issue | Check multipathing, HBA |
| DAVG high | Storage array | Check array latency |
