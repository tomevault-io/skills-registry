# Privacy Scanner — WiFi Surveillance Device Detector

Defensive security tool that scans the local WiFi network to detect hidden cameras, microphones, and surveillance devices in rental accommodations (Airbnb, Booking, VRBO, etc.).

## Overview

Airbnb's policy **prohibits ALL indoor cameras and recording devices**, even if disclosed and even if turned off. This tool helps guests verify compliance by scanning the WiFi network for surveillance equipment.

The scanner runs 7 phases: host discovery → manufacturer identification → port scanning → service discovery → deep inspection → risk classification → report generation.

**What it detects:**
- IP cameras from known surveillance manufacturers (Hikvision, Dahua, EZVIZ, Amcrest, etc.)
- Consumer cameras (Wyze, Blink, Arlo, Nest, Ring, Foscam, Yi, Eufy)
- Hidden cameras using generic IoT chipsets (ESP32, Realtek, MediaTek)
- RTSP streaming services, camera web interfaces, vendor-specific protocols
- ONVIF-compatible devices, mDNS-advertising cameras, UPnP media devices

**What it CANNOT detect:**
- Cameras on a separate VLAN or wired-only network
- Cellular-connected cameras (4G/LTE)
- Cameras powered off or in standby
- Devices using MAC address randomization
- Local-storage cameras not connected to any network
- Audio-only recording devices

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites

**CRITICAL**: `nmap` is mandatory on all platforms. Python 3.8+ is required for the cross-platform scanner.

Install per platform:
- **Linux (Arch)**: `sudo pacman -S nmap python arp-scan avahi`
- **Linux (Debian)**: `sudo apt install nmap python3 arp-scan avahi-utils`
- **macOS**: `brew install nmap python arp-scan`
- **Windows**: Install nmap from https://nmap.org/download (includes Npcap), Python from https://python.org

Python packages (optional, improve detection):
```bash
pip install python-nmap zeroconf requests
```

### Step 2: Run the Scanner

**Cross-platform (recommended)** — works on Linux, macOS, and Windows:
```bash
# Linux / macOS
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py

# Windows (Admin PowerShell)
python scripts\scan.py
```

**Linux-only** — bash version (full feature parity):
```bash
sudo bash scripts/scan.sh
```

**Common flags** (same for both scan.py and scan.sh):
```bash
# Quick scan (~2-3 minutes)
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py --quick

# Report in English or Spanish (default: Portuguese)
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py --lang en
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py --lang es

# Specify interface/subnet manually
sudo python3 scripts/scan.py --interface wlan0 --subnet 192.168.1.0/24
```

**CRITICAL**: Run with `sudo` (Linux/macOS) or as Administrator (Windows). ARP scanning and SYN port scanning require elevated privileges. Without them, the scanner falls back to less reliable methods.

### Step 4: Interpret Results

The scanner classifies every device into risk levels:

| Risk | Icon | Meaning | Action |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| CRITICAL | 🔴 | Confirmed camera/streaming device | **Photograph. Contact Airbnb. Consider leaving.** |
| HIGH | 🟠 | Strong camera indicators | Investigate physically. Check if disclosed in listing. |
| MODERATE | 🟡 | Suspicious/unidentified device | Try to locate and identify the device. |
| LOW | 🟢 | Probably safe (IoT, chipset device) | No action needed unless suspicious location. |
| INFO | 🔵 | Known safe device | No action needed. |

### Step 5: Take Action (if threats found)

For CRITICAL or HIGH findings:
1. **Do NOT** disconnect or tamper with the device
2. **Photograph** the device and its location
3. **Save** the scan report (terminal output + HTML file in `./privacy-scan-results/`)
4. **Contact Airbnb**: App → Your Trips → Get Help → Report a safety concern
5. **Airbnb Emergency**: +1-855-424-7262
6. If you feel unsafe, **leave the property**
7. Consider contacting **local law enforcement**

## Scanning Phases

| Phase | Name | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Host Discovery | `arp-scan`, `nmap -sn` | Find ALL devices on the network |
| 2 | OUI Analysis | nmap-mac-prefixes + embedded DB | Identify manufacturers, flag camera brands |
| 3 | Port Scan | `nmap -sS/-sT -sV` | Scan camera-specific ports (RTSP, HTTP, vendor) |
| 4 | Service Discovery | `avahi-browse`, nmap NSE | mDNS, UPnP, ONVIF, SSDP discovery |
| 5 | Deep Inspection | `curl`, nmap NSE | HTTP banner grab, RTSP verify, keyword search |
| 6 | Classification | Evidence correlation | Apply risk matrix to all collected evidence |
| 7 | Report | Terminal + HTML | Formatted output with actionable recommendations |

Phases 4-5 are skipped in `--quick` mode.

## Risk Classification Matrix

| Condition | Risk Level |
|-----------|-----------|
| Surveillance manufacturer OUI + RTSP/streaming port open | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Surveillance manufacturer OUI + camera web UI confirmed | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Any device + confirmed active RTSP streaming | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Camera service advertising via mDNS (e.g. `_rtsp._tcp`) | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Camera web page title (NETSurveillance, IPCamera, DVR, etc.) | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Known surveillance manufacturer, no open ports detected | 🟠 HIGH |
| Known consumer camera brand (Wyze, Blink, Arlo, etc.) | 🟠 HIGH |
| Manufacturer name contains camera/surveillance keywords | 🟠 HIGH |
| Unknown device + RTSP port open | 🟠 HIGH |
| Unknown device + vendor-specific camera port open | 🟠 HIGH |
| IoT chipset (Espressif, Tuya) + camera ports open | 🟡 MODERATE |
| IoT chipset + HTTP server (no camera keywords) | 🟡 MODERATE |
| Unknown manufacturer + HTTP server | 🟡 MODERATE |
| Completely unidentified device | 🟡 MODERATE |
| IoT chipset, no camera ports | 🟢 LOW |
| Generic network chipset | 🟢 LOW |
| Known safe manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, Intel, Dell, etc.) | 🔵 INFO |
| Identified non-camera device | 🔵 INFO |

## Critical Rules

- **CRITICAL**: Always run with `sudo`. ARP scans and SYN scans require root.
- **CRITICAL**: Never skip Phase 2 (OUI analysis). Manufacturer ID is the strongest signal.
- **CRITICAL**: Scan ALL devices, not just flagged ones. Cameras often use generic chipset MACs.
- **CRITICAL**: Use `-T4` timing (aggressive but safe). Do NOT use `-T5` — IoT devices may crash.
- **CRITICAL**: Always mention scan limitations in the report. This is not a comprehensive physical sweep.
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT advise the user to disconnect or tamper with found devices — this could destroy evidence.

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **WRONG**: Scanning only devices with suspicious OUI
✅ **CORRECT**: Scan ALL devices — cheap cameras use generic Espressif/Realtek MACs

❌ **WRONG**: Trusting only OUI lookup for device identification
✅ **CORRECT**: Correlate OUI + ports + HTTP fingerprint + mDNS for accurate classification

❌ **WRONG**: Only checking port 554 for cameras
✅ **CORRECT**: Check ALL camera ports including vendor-specific (37777, 34567, 8000, 9000, etc.)

❌ **WRONG**: Ignoring mDNS services
✅ **CORRECT**: Many cameras announce `_rtsp._tcp` or `_camera._tcp` via Bonjour

❌ **WRONG**: Concluding "no cameras" after a clean scan
✅ **CORRECT**: State that the WiFi scan was clean BUT cameras could exist on other networks, wired, or offline
