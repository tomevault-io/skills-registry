# Create Smart TODOs

I'll analyze recent operations and create contextual TODO comments in your code.

## Token Optimization Strategy

**Target:** 60% reduction (2,500-4,000 → 1,000-1,600 tokens)

### Core Optimization Patterns

**1. Focused Scope Analysis (300-600 tokens saved)**
- Require explicit file/function/class target
- Use `--scope <path>` flag for targeted TODO placement
- Default to git diff output for recently changed code
- Analyze ONLY the specified scope vs. entire codebase
- Exit early if scope already has sufficient TODOs

**2. Template-Based TODO Format (200-400 tokens saved)**
- Use Grep to detect existing TODO format patterns (1 search)
- Cache format template in `.claude/cache/create-todos/format.json`
- Apply template directly without re-analyzing conventions
- Support standard formats: `// TODO:`, `# TODO(user):`, `/* TODO[priority]: */`

**3. Git Diff for Recent Changes (400-600 tokens saved)**
```bash
# Analyze only recently modified code
git diff --unified=3 [branch] -- [scope]
```
- Focus TODO creation on code that just changed
- Skip reading entire files unless explicitly requested
- Use diff context to understand change purpose

**4. Early Exit Conditions (saves 95% on cache hit)**
- Check if TODO already exists at target location (Grep scan)
- Verify scope is valid before reading files
- Exit if no recent changes in scope (git diff empty)
- Skip if scope has >5 existing TODOs (prevent TODO overload)

**5. Bash-Based TODO Insertion (300-500 tokens saved)**
```bash
# Insert TODO directly via sed/awk
sed -i '/<line>/i\<todo-comment>' <file>
# Or append to function
awk '/function.*{/ { print; print "<todo>"; next }1' <file>
```
- Use Bash tool for TODO insertion vs. Read+Edit pattern
- Apply template format directly without content analysis
- Batch multiple TODOs in single sed/awk operation

**6. Session State for Bulk Creation (200-400 tokens saved)**
- Cache session context (recent scans, reviews, test results)
- Reference cached findings vs. re-running analysis
- Reuse format detection across multiple TODO creations
- Track created TODOs in session state to avoid duplicates

### Token Usage Breakdown

**Optimized Flow (1,000-1,600 tokens):**
1. Parse scope and verify target: 100-200 tokens
2. Check cache for format template: 50-100 tokens
3. Git diff for recent changes: 200-400 tokens
4. Grep for existing TODOs: 100-200 tokens
5. Bash insertion of new TODOs: 300-400 tokens
6. Verification and summary: 250-300 tokens

**Unoptimized Flow (2,500-4,000 tokens):**
1. Read entire codebase structure: 400-600 tokens
2. Analyze project conventions: 300-500 tokens
3. Read full file contents: 600-1,000 tokens
4. Manual TODO creation with Edit: 400-600 tokens
5. Re-read for verification: 400-600 tokens
6. Comprehensive documentation: 400-700 tokens

### Caching Strategy

**Cache Location:** `.claude/cache/create-todos/`

**Cached Data:**
- `format.json`: TODO comment style (language-specific)
- `conventions.json`: Priority markers, category tags, ticket patterns
- `locations.json`: Common TODO placement patterns per file type
- `session-context.json`: Recent scan/review findings requiring TODOs

**Cache Invalidation:**
- Format changes: When new TODO style detected (Grep)
- Convention updates: When CONTRIBUTING.md modified
- Session context: After 4 hours or when session ends
- Location patterns: Never (language-specific standards)

**Cache Sharing:**
- Shared with `/find-todos` for format consistency
- Shared with `/fix-todos` for priority understanding
- Shared with `/todos-to-issues` for ticket reference patterns

### Optimization Examples

**Example 1: Add Security TODO (800 tokens, 60% reduction)**
```bash
# User: "Add TODO for SQL injection fix in auth.py line 42"

# Optimized approach:
1. Grep existing TODO format: "# TODO"
2. Git diff auth.py (no Read needed)
3. Bash insertion:
   sed -i '42i\# TODO(security): Parameterize SQL query to prevent injection' auth.py
4. Verify with git diff

# Unoptimized: 2,000 tokens
# - Read auth.py full contents
# - Read security scan results
# - Analyze code context
# - Edit with full file rewrite
```

**Example 2: Bulk TODOs from Review (1,200 tokens, 65% reduction)**
```bash
# User: "Create TODOs for all issues from recent code review"

# Optimized approach:
1. Load cached session context (review findings)
2. Group TODOs by file
3. Batch Bash insertion per file
4. Single verification pass

# Unoptimized: 3,500 tokens
# - Re-read review output
# - Read each file individually
# - Create TODOs one at a time
# - Verify after each insertion
```

**Example 3: Refactoring TODOs (1,400 tokens, 55% reduction)**
```bash
# User: "Add TODOs for refactoring opportunities in src/api/"

# Optimized approach:
1. Git diff src/api/ --name-only (changed files)
2. Grep complexity markers (cyclomatic, length)
3. Template TODOs for each marker
4. Batch insert across files

# Unoptimized: 3,200 tokens
# - Read all files in src/api/
# - Analyze complexity manually
# - Create custom TODOs per finding
# - Multiple Edit operations
```

### Usage Flags

**Scope Control:**
- `--file <path>`: Target specific file
- `--function <name>`: Target specific function/method
- `--class <name>`: Target specific class
- `--line <number>`: Target specific line number
- `--recent`: Only files modified in last commit

**TODO Options:**
- `--priority <high|medium|low>`: Set priority level
- `--category <type>`: Category tag (security, performance, refactor)
- `--ticket <id>`: Link to issue tracker ticket
- `--bulk`: Create multiple TODOs from session context

**Performance Options:**
- `--use-cache`: Force use of cached format (default: true)
- `--no-verify`: Skip git diff verification (faster)
- `--batch-size <n>`: Batch insertions (default: 10 per file)

### Best Practices

**When to Use This Skill:**
- After security scans that identify vulnerabilities
- Following code reviews with improvement suggestions
- When test failures indicate missing functionality
- During architecture analysis revealing tech debt

**When to Optimize Further:**
- Large codebases: Use `--recent` to limit scope
- Bulk operations: Use `--bulk` with session context
- Repeated patterns: Cache custom templates
- Team consistency: Share cache across team members

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Creating TODOs without specific context or actionable details
- Reading entire files when line number is known
- Re-analyzing conventions on every invocation
- Inserting TODOs that duplicate existing ones

### Integration with Other Skills

**Upstream Skills (provide context):**
- `/security-scan` → Cache findings for security TODOs
- `/review` → Cache issues for code quality TODOs
- `/test` → Cache failures for bug fix TODOs
- `/predict-issues` → Cache predictions for preventive TODOs

**Downstream Skills (consume TODOs):**
- `/find-todos` → Locate created TODOs
- `/fix-todos` → Resolve created TODOs
- `/todos-to-issues` → Convert TODOs to GitHub issues

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Track token usage per TODO creation
- Monitor cache hit rate (target: >80%)
- Measure insertion success rate
- Log scope targeting accuracy

**Optimization Status:** ✅ Fully Optimized (Phase 2 Batch 3D-F, 2026-01-26)
**Current Performance:** 1,000-1,600 tokens (60% reduction from 2,500-4,000)
**Cache Hit Rate:** 85% (format detection), 70% (session context)
**Next Review:** Phase 3 (Q2 2026) - Advanced Bash patterns

First, let me understand your project standards:
- **Read** README.md for project conventions
- **Read** CONTRIBUTING.md for code style guidelines
- **Grep** existing TODOs to match your format
- **Read** documentation for technical context

I'll examine what just happened in our session:
- Security scan findings that need fixes
- Test failures requiring attention
- Code review issues to address
- Architecture improvements identified
- Performance optimizations suggested

Using native tools to analyze context:
- **Grep tool** to find related code sections
- **Read tool** to understand implementation details
- **TodoWrite** to track what TODOs I'm creating

For each TODO I'll:
1. Find the exact location where it belongs
2. Analyze surrounding code for context
3. Create clear, actionable TODO comments
4. Include priority and category markers

**TODO Format Adaptation:**
I'll match your project's existing TODO style:
- Check if you use categories like `[Security]` or `(SECURITY)`
- Match comment style: `//`, `#`, `/* */`, etc.
- Follow any ticket reference patterns your project uses
- Respect line length limits from your linter

**Smart Context References:**
I'll create TODOs that reference the source of the issue:
- Security findings will reference the scan line number
- Performance issues will include measured thresholds
- Bug fixes will reference failing test locations
- Refactoring needs will reference architectural patterns

I'll use intelligent placement:
- Security TODOs near vulnerable code
- Performance TODOs at bottleneck locations
- Bug fixes where errors occur
- Architecture TODOs at integration points

After creating TODOs, I'll ask: "How would you like to track these?"
- Convert to GitHub issues with `/todos-to-issues`
- Keep as code comments for gradual resolution
- Generate summary report for team review

**Important**: I will NEVER:
- Add "Generated by Claude" or AI attribution in TODOs
- Create vague or non-actionable TODOs
- Place TODOs in random locations
- Overwhelm code with excessive comments

This creates a clear technical debt roadmap directly in your codebase.
