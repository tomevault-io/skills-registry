# DevContainer Customization Helper

This skill helps users customize their devcontainer by providing examples and guidance for common tasks.

## Common Customization Patterns

### Adding Packages to Dockerfile

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    package-name \
    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### Adding VS Code Extensions

```json
{
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": ["publisher.extension-name"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding DevContainer Features

```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/feature-name:version": {}
  }
}
```

### Setting Environment Variables

```json
{
  "remoteEnv": {
    "VAR_NAME": "value"
  }
}
```

## Language-Specific Examples

### Python Development
- Feature: `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1`
- Extensions: `ms-python.python`, `ms-python.vscode-pylance`
- Tools: `python3-pip`, `python3-venv`

### Node.js Development
- Feature: `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1`
- Extensions: `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`, `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
- Tools: npm, yarn, pnpm

### Database Tools
- PostgreSQL: `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/postgres:1`
- Extensions: `ms-ossdata.vscode-postgresql`

### Docker-in-Docker
- Feature: `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2`

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks "how do I add Python to my devcontainer?"
- User wants to install a specific tool or language
- User needs help with VS Code extensions
- User wants to set up databases or services
- User asks about devcontainer configuration

## What NOT to Explain

- BitBot's internal template merging system
- How BitBot copies files during init
- Container orchestration internals
- SPARC methodology or BitBot development

## Focus

Help users accomplish their customization goals with practical, working examples that follow devcontainer standards.
