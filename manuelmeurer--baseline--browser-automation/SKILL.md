# Browser Automation

## Tools

Three tools are available for browser automation:

1. **agent-browser** — CLI tool for AI-driven browser automation.
2. **playwright-cli** — CLI tool for scripted browser automation. Preferred for most tasks.
3. **Chrome DevTools MCP** — MCP server for direct browser control via DevTools protocol.

**Default to agent-browser.** Fall back to playwright-cli if:
- agent-browser is not available
- The task requires precise, scripted automation without AI interaction

Only use Chrome DevTools MCP if:
- The task requires interacting with an already-open browser session
- The task specifically needs DevTools features (e.g. network inspection, performance tracing)

## agent-browser

For detailed instructions, read [references/agent-browser.md](references/agent-browser.md).

Run `agent-browser --help` to understand available commands, options, and usage.

## playwright-cli

For detailed instructions, read [references/playwright-cli.md](references/playwright-cli.md) and the reference documents in [references/playwright-cli/](references/playwright-cli/).

## Chrome DevTools MCP

For detailed instructions, read [references/chrome-devtools.md](references/chrome-devtools.md).

If the agent opens a new browser page via Chrome DevTools MCP, it must close that page when done (using `close_page`).
