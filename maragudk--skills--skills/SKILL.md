description: Address code review feedback by walking through comments one at a time with the user. Use when the user has received code review comments — on a GitHub PR, in a document in the repo, or directly in conversation — and wants to work through them methodically. Also trigger when the user mentions "address review", "review comments", "PR feedback", or wants to respond to code review feedback. Use when this capability is needed.

# Address Code Review

Work through code review comments with the user, one comment at a time. Never present multiple comments at once.

## Input sources

Comments may come from:

1. **GitHub PR** - Fetch inline and general comments using `gh api`
2. **Document in the repo** - Parse whatever markdown structure is found
3. **Conversation** - Comments given directly by the user

## Process

### 1. Collect feedback

- **GitHub PR**: Use GraphQL to fetch all comments in one go. Fetch inline review comments via `pullRequest.reviewThreads` and general PR comments via `pullRequest.comments`. Skip already-resolved threads (`isResolved`). Still present outdated but unresolved comments (`isOutdated`), noting to the user that the code has changed since the comment was left.
- **Document**: Read the file and extract review items.
- **Conversation**: Use the comments as provided.

### 2. Triage one at a time

For each comment, strictly one at a time:

1. Present the comment to the user.
2. Share your own assessment: agree, disagree, or propose an alternative. Explain your reasoning briefly.
3. Wait for the user to decide what to do (apply, skip, modify, etc.).
4. Record the agreed-upon action. Do not apply code changes yet.

For GitHub PR inline comments: immediately reply to the comment on GitHub and resolve the thread after discussion.

### 3. Apply changes

After all comments have been discussed, apply all agreed-upon code changes in one batch.

For GitHub PR general comments (which may contain multiple issues in one comment): post a single summary reply after all issues in that comment are addressed.

For document sources: update the document with status/progress as appropriate.

## GitHub CLI reference

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Fetch all comments | GraphQL query on `pullRequest.reviewThreads` (inline) and `pullRequest.comments` (general) |
| Reply to inline comment | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{id}/replies -X POST -f body="..."` |
| Reply to general comment | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr}/comments -X POST -f body="..."` |
| Resolve a thread | GraphQL mutation `resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "..."})` |
