# Memory Check Skill

This skill helps you check system memory usage and identify cleanup opportunities on Linux systems.

## Instructions

When activated, follow these steps to provide comprehensive memory information:

### 1. Check Overall Memory Usage

Run the `free` command to show memory and swap usage:

```bash
free -h
```

This shows:
- Total memory available
- Used memory
- Free memory
- Shared memory
- Buffer/cache memory
- Available memory (what can actually be used)
- Swap usage

### 2. Check Detailed Memory Information

For more detailed breakdown:

```bash
cat /proc/meminfo | head -20
```

This provides:
- MemTotal: Total usable RAM
- MemFree: Free RAM
- MemAvailable: Available RAM for new applications
- Buffers: Memory used for file buffers
- Cached: Memory used for caching

### 3. Check Top Memory-Consuming Processes

Show the top 10 processes consuming the most memory:

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -11
```

This helps identify which processes are using the most memory and might be candidates for cleanup.

### 4. Check Disk Space (Related Cleanup)

Since memory cleanup often goes hand-in-hand with disk cleanup:

```bash
df -h
```

### 5. Optional: Check System Cache

To see how much memory is used by caches:

```bash
sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```

**Warning**: Only suggest running this if the user explicitly wants to clear caches, as it requires sudo and will clear page cache, dentries, and inodes.

## Presenting Results

After running the commands, present the information in a clear format:

1. **Memory Summary**: Show total, used, free, and available memory
2. **Memory Percentage**: Calculate and show memory usage percentage
3. **Top Memory Users**: List the top processes consuming memory
4. **Cleanup Recommendations**: Based on the results, suggest:
   - If memory usage is high (>80%), recommend closing unnecessary applications
   - If swap is being heavily used, recommend adding more RAM or reducing memory load
   - Identify specific processes that are using excessive memory
   - Suggest disk cleanup if disk space is also low

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Memory Check

User: "Check my memory usage"

Response: Run the commands and present:
- Total memory: 8GB
- Used: 6.2GB (77%)
- Available: 1.8GB
- Top processes: Chrome (2.1GB), Firefox (1.5GB)
- Recommendation: Memory usage is moderate. Consider closing unused browser tabs.

### Example 2: Memory Cleanup Needed

User: "My system is slow, check if I need to clean up memory"

Response: Run all commands and present:
- Memory usage: 95%
- Swap usage: 80%
- Top processes identified
- Recommendations for closing specific high-memory processes
- Suggestion to restart memory-heavy applications

## Notes

- These commands work on Linux systems (including Raspberry Pi OS)
- Some cleanup commands may require sudo privileges
- Always explain what each command does before running it
- Be careful with cache-clearing commands as they require sudo
