description: Development workflow and quality gates for the Bun + TypeScript stack. **ALWAYS use before commits** to ensure quality gates are met. Also use when starting development or when user asks about workflow process. Examples - "before commit", "quality gates", "workflow checklist", "bun commands", "pre-commit checks". Use when this capability is needed.

You are an expert in guiding developers through the project's development workflow and quality gates. You ensure all necessary steps are executed before committing code.

**For complete project rules and standards, see CLAUDE.md (global instructions)**

## When to Engage

You should proactively assist:

- **Before committing code** (most important)
- When user asks about workflow or process
- When setting up quality gates
- When troubleshooting Bun-specific issues

## Pre-Commit Checklist

**MANDATORY - Execute in this order:**

```bash
# Step 1: Update barrel files (if files were added/moved/deleted)
bun run craft

# Step 2: Format code
bun run format

# Step 3: Lint code
bun run lint

# Step 4: Type check
bun run type-check

# Step 5: Run tests
bun run test
```

**Or run all at once:**

```bash
bun run quality  # Executes all 5 steps
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Files added/moved/deleted? Run `bun run craft`
- [ ] All tests passing? (`bun run test` - green)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors? (`bun run type-check` - clean)
- [ ] No linting errors? (`bun run lint` - clean)
- [ ] Code formatted? (`bun run format` - applied)
- [ ] Committed to feature branch? (not main/dev)
- [ ] Commit message follows conventions?

**For complete TypeScript type safety rules (type guards), see `typescript-type-safety` skill**

## Bun-Specific Commands

### Testing Commands

**CRITICAL - NEVER use:**

```bash
bun test  # ❌ WRONG - May not work correctly
```

**ALWAYS use:**

```bash
bun run test  # ✅ CORRECT - Uses package.json script
```

### Barrel Files

**ALWAYS run after creating/moving/deleting files:**

```bash
bun run craft
```

This updates barrel files (index.ts exports) for clean imports.

**When to run:**

- After creating new files
- After moving/renaming files
- After deleting files
- Before committing changes

## Bun Runtime APIs

**Prefer Bun APIs over Node.js:**

```typescript
// ✅ Password hashing
const hashedPassword = await Bun.password.hash(password, {
  algorithm: "bcrypt",
  cost: 10,
});

// ✅ File operations
const file = Bun.file("./config.json");
const config = await file.json();

// ✅ UUID v7
const id = Bun.randomUUIDv7();

// ✅ SQLite
import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";
const db = new Database("mydb.sqlite");

// ✅ HTTP server
import { serve } from "bun";
serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(req) {
    return new Response("Hello from Bun!");
  },
});
```

## Quality Gates Execution Order

**Why this order matters:**

1. **craft** - Ensures imports are correct before other checks
2. **format** - Auto-fixes formatting issues
3. **lint** - Catches code quality issues
4. **type-check** - Validates TypeScript correctness
5. **test** - Ensures functionality works

**Each step depends on the previous one passing.**

## Common Workflow Mistakes

**Mistakes to avoid:**

1. ❌ Using `bun test` instead of `bun run test`
2. ❌ Forgetting `bun run craft` after file operations
3. ❌ Committing with TypeScript errors
4. ❌ Skipping quality gates
5. ❌ Running quality gates out of order
6. ❌ Committing directly to main/dev branches
7. ❌ Using Node.js APIs instead of Bun APIs
8. ❌ Relative imports instead of barrel files

## Quick Reference

**Before every commit:**

```bash
bun run quality    # Run all quality gates
git status         # Verify changes
git add .          # Stage changes
git commit -m "feat(scope): description"  # Commit with convention
```

**Starting new feature:**

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
# ... make changes ...
bun run quality
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
```

**File operations workflow:**

```bash
# Create new files
# ...
bun run craft      # Update barrel files
bun run quality    # Run quality gates
git commit
```

## Remember

- **Quality gates are mandatory** - Not optional
- **Bun commands are specific** - Use `bun run test`, not `bun test`
- **Order matters** - Follow the quality gates sequence
- **Barrel files are critical** - Run `bun run craft` after file changes
- **Check CLAUDE.md** - For complete project rules and standards
