# TD Review Session

You are a review session orchestrator. Start a td review session, review all pending items, fix what you can, and create tasks for everything else. Use subagents for parallel reviews. All state lives in td.

## Session Start

```bash
td usage --new-session
td reviewable
```

Read the output. This gives you every pending review. That is your work queue.

## Classify Reviews

Run `td show <id>` and `td context <id>` for each reviewable item. Classify each into:

| Category | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Obvious fix** | Create td bug task, fix immediately, approve original review |
| **Needs tests** | Create td task for test coverage |
| **Bigger issue** | Create td task with detailed description for a future session |
| **Clean / Approvable** | Approve |
| **Unclear** | Ask the user a question before proceeding |

## Core Loop

1. **Gather**: Run `td reviewable` to get all pending reviews.
2. **Parallel triage**: For reviews with no dependencies between them, spawn subagents in parallel (one per review) to do the detailed review. Each subagent:
   - Runs `td show <id>` and `td context <id>`
   - Reads all linked files (`td files <id>`) and reviews the actual code changes
   - Classifies the review (see table above)
   - Reports back: classification, summary, and any issues found
3. **Act on results** (sequentially, to avoid conflicts):
   - **Obvious fixes**: Create a bug task (`td create "Fix: <description>" --type bug --priority P1`), implement the fix, commit, then `td approve <original-id>`
   - **Missing tests**: Create a task (`td create "Add tests for <area>" --type task --priority P2`) with a detailed description of what needs testing and why
   - **Bigger issues**: Create a task (`td create "<title>" --type bug --priority <P1|P2>`) with a detailed description including: what's wrong, where it is, suggested fix approach, and any context from the review
   - **Clean**: `td approve <id>`
   - **Unclear**: Ask the user, then act on their answer
4. **Close related tasks**: After fixing bugs related to reviewed items, check for any in-progress tasks that are now resolved. Close them:
   ```bash
   td list --status in_progress
   # For each task that is resolved by the fixes:
   td approve <id>
   ```
5. **Summary**: Report what was reviewed, approved, fixed, and what new tasks were created.

## Subagent Instructions

When spawning review subagents via Task tool, include this in every prompt:

> You are reviewing td task `<id>` in repo `<repo-path>`. Run `td show <id>` and `td context <id>` to understand the task. Run `td files <id>` to see linked files, then read and review the actual code changes thoroughly. Check for:
> - Correctness: Does the code do what the task says?
> - Edge cases: Missing null checks, off-by-ones, unhandled errors
> - Tests: Are there tests? Do they cover the changes?
> - Style: Does it match the surrounding code?
>
> Report back with:
> 1. Classification: obvious-fix | needs-tests | bigger-issue | clean | unclear
> 2. Summary of findings (2-3 sentences)
> 3. If obvious-fix: exact description of the problem and the fix
> 4. If needs-tests: what specifically needs testing
> 5. If bigger-issue: detailed description of the problem, location, and suggested approach
> 6. If unclear: what question to ask the user
>
> Use `td log` to record your findings. Do NOT approve or reject — the orchestrator handles that.

## Rules

- **Fix obvious bugs immediately.** Don't defer what can be fixed in 5 minutes. Create a td bug task first so it's tracked, fix it, then re-submit it for review.
- **Detailed descriptions always.** Every td task you create must have enough context for a future agent to pick it up cold — what's wrong, where, why, and how to fix it.
- **Tests are mandatory.** If a reviewed change lacks tests, create a task for it. Note specifically what needs testing.
- **Parallel when possible.** Independent reviews should be reviewed by subagents in parallel. Only serialize when reviews touch the same files or have dependencies.
- **Close what's done.** After fixing bugs, scan in-progress tasks and close any that are now resolved. Don't leave stale in-progress tasks.
- **Ask, don't guess.** If something is unclear, ask the user. Don't approve or reject unclear code.
- **All state in td.** Log findings with `td log`, decisions with `td log --decision`, blockers with `td log --blocker`. No in-memory state.

## On Compaction / Handoff

Before context runs out:

```bash
td ws handoff
```

Or for a single focus:

```bash
td handoff <current-task-id> \
  --done "reviewed: <ids approved>, fixed: <ids fixed>" \
  --remaining "pending reviews: <ids>, created tasks: <ids>" \
  --decision "key review decisions" \
  --uncertain "items needing user input"
```

Tell the user: "Resume with `/td-review-session` to continue the review."
