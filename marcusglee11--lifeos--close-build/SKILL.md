# Close Build

Merge to main and clean up. Closure gates run automatically via the PreToolUse hook.

## Default behavior

```bash
python3 scripts/workflow/close_build.py
```

This runs:
- squash merge to `main`,
- local cleanup (branch delete + active context clear).

Note: targeted closure tests and doc stewardship are enforced by the
`.claude/hooks/close-build-gate.sh` PreToolUse hook on `git merge`/`git push`.
They no longer need to be invoked manually.

## Dry run (gates only)

```bash
python3 scripts/workflow/closure_gate.py
```

Use to check gate status without merge/cleanup. Returns JSON verdict.

## No cleanup mode

```bash
python3 scripts/workflow/close_build.py --no-cleanup
```

Use when you need to keep branch/context after merge.

## Git worktree constraint

Run `close_build.py` (and underlying `closure_pack.py`) from the **worktree directory**, not the primary repo.

When `main` is already checked out in the primary worktree, the script
detects this automatically (via `git branch --show-current` on the repo root)
and skips the `checkout main` step. The merge proceeds against the primary
worktree's `main` directly.

If you accidentally run from the primary repo on a scoped branch, it hard-blocks
with `ISOLATION_REQUIRED`. Recover in one command:

```bash
python3 scripts/workflow/start_build.py --recover-primary
```

## Report contract (strict)

Output must use this section order:

1. `Branch`
2. `Commits`
3. `Test Results`
4. `What Was Done`
5. `What Remains`
