<objective>
Provide systematic debugging techniques for error investigation, root cause analysis, and fix implementation. Ensures errors are properly classified, root causes identified (not symptoms), and solutions documented to prevent recurrence.
</objective>

<quick_start>
Debug errors systematically:

1. Reproduce error consistently (100% reliable reproduction)
2. Classify by type (syntax/runtime/logic/integration/performance) and severity (critical/high/medium/low)
3. Isolate root cause using binary search, logging, breakpoints, or 5 Whys
4. Implement fix with failing test first (TDD)
5. Add regression tests to prevent recurrence
6. Document in error-log.md with ERR-XXXX ID

**Key principle**: Fix root causes, not symptoms. Use 5 Whys to drill down.
</quick_start>

<prerequisites>
Before debugging:
- Error can be reproduced (even if intermittent, identify conditions)
- Logs available (application logs, stack traces, network logs)
- Development environment set up for testing

Check error-log.md for similar historical errors before starting.
</prerequisites>

<workflow>
<step number="1">
**Search for similar errors**

Check error-log.md for past occurrences:

```bash
# Search by error message
grep -i "connection timeout" error-log.md

# Search by component
grep "Component: StudentProgressService" error-log.md

# Search by error type
grep "Type: Integration" error-log.md
```

If similar error found:

- Review previous fix (workaround or root cause?)
- Check if error recurred (>2 occurrences = need permanent fix)
- Note patterns (same component, same conditions, timing)

**If recurring error**: Prioritize permanent fix over workaround.
</step>

<step number="2">
**Reproduce error consistently**

Create minimal reproduction:

1. Gather context: error message, stack trace, timestamp, user actions, environment
2. Create minimal test case that triggers error 100% of time
3. If intermittent: identify conditions (timing, data state, race conditions)

Example reproduction:

```bash
# API error
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/endpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"field": "value"}'

# Frontend error
# 1. Navigate to /dashboard
# 2. Click "Load Data" button
# 3. Error appears in console
```

**Validation**: Can trigger error reliably before proceeding.
</step>

<step number="3">
**Classify error**

**By type**:

- **Syntax**: Code doesn't compile/parse (typos, missing brackets, linting errors)
- **Runtime**: Code runs but crashes (null pointer, type error, uncaught exception)
- **Logic**: Code runs but wrong result (calculation error, wrong branch taken)
- **Integration**: External dependency fails (API timeout, database connection, service unavailable)
- **Performance**: Code works but too slow (timeout, memory leak, N+1 queries)

**By severity**:

- **Critical**: Data loss, security breach, total system failure
- **High**: Feature broken, blocks users from core functionality
- **Medium**: Feature degraded, workaround exists
- **Low**: Minor UX issue, cosmetic, no functional impact

Example classification:

```markdown
Type: Integration (API call to external service fails)
Severity: High (dashboard doesn't load, blocks teachers)
Component: StudentProgressService.fetchExternalData()
Frequency: 30% of requests (intermittent)
```

See references/error-classification.md for detailed matrix.
</step>

<step number="4">
**Isolate root cause**

Use systematic techniques:

**Binary search** (for large codebases):

- Add logging at midpoint of suspected code
- If error before midpoint → investigate first half
- If error after midpoint → investigate second half
- Repeat until narrowed to specific function

**Increase logging**:

```python
# Add debug logs around suspected area
logger.debug(f"Before API call: student_id={student_id}, params={params}")
response = api.fetch_data(student_id)
logger.debug(f"After API call: status={response.status}, data_len={len(response.data)}")
```

**Use breakpoints** (interactive debugging):

```bash
# Python
python -m pdb script.py

# Node.js
node inspect server.js

# Browser (Chrome DevTools)
# Set breakpoints, inspect variables, step through code
```

**Check assumptions**:

- Is variable the value you expect? (log it, don't assume)
- Is function being called when you expect? (add entry/exit logs)
- Are external dependencies available? (health check endpoints)

**Apply 5 Whys** (drill down to root cause):

```markdown
1. Why did dashboard fail to load?
   → API call to external service timed out

2. Why did API call timeout?
   → Request took >30 seconds (timeout limit)

3. Why did request take >30 seconds?
   → External service response time was 45 seconds

4. Why was external service so slow?
   → Requesting too much data (1000 records instead of 10)

5. Why requesting 1000 records?
   → Missing pagination parameter in API call

Root cause: Missing pagination parameter causes over-fetching
```

**Validation**: Root cause identified (not just symptoms). Can explain why error occurred.
</step>

<step number="5">
**Implement fix (TDD approach)**

1. Write failing test first:

```python
def test_fetch_external_data_with_pagination():
    """Test that API call includes pagination parameter"""
    service = StudentProgressService()
    result = service.fetchExternalData(student_id=123)

    assert len(result) <= 10  # Max 10 records per page
    assert result.has_next_page  # Pagination metadata present
```

2. Implement fix:

```python
# Before (broken)
def fetchExternalData(self, student_id):
    return api.get(f"/students/{student_id}/data")

# After (fixed)
def fetchExternalData(self, student_id, page_size=10):
    return api.get(
        f"/students/{student_id}/data",
        params={"page_size": page_size}
    )
```

3. Verify fix:

```bash
# Run test (should pass)
pytest tests/test_student_progress_service.py

# Manually test reproduction steps (error should not occur)
```

**Validation**: Fix addresses root cause, all tests pass, error no longer reproduces.
</step>

<step number="6">
**Add regression tests**

Prevent recurrence:

```python
# Unit test for specific bug
def test_pagination_parameter_included():
    """Regression test for ERR-0042: Missing pagination"""
    service = StudentProgressService()
    with patch('api.get') as mock_get:
        service.fetchExternalData(student_id=123)

        # Verify pagination param passed
        mock_get.assert_called_with(
            '/students/123/data',
            params={'page_size': 10}
        )

# Integration test for user flow
def test_dashboard_loads_with_large_datasets():
    """Ensure dashboard handles large datasets without timeout"""
    client = TestClient()
    response = client.get('/dashboard/student/123')

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.elapsed.total_seconds() < 5  # No timeout
```

**Validation**: Tests added covering error scenario, tests pass consistently.
</step>

<step number="7">
**Document in error-log.md**

Create entry with ERR-XXXX ID:

```markdown
## ERR-0042: Dashboard Timeout Due to Missing Pagination

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Severity**: High
**Type**: Integration
**Component**: StudentProgressService.fetchExternalData()
**Reporter**: QA team (staging environment)

### Error Description

Dashboard fails to load student progress data, showing timeout error after 30 seconds.

### Root Cause

API call to external service was missing pagination parameter, causing over-fetching of 1000+ records instead of paginated 10 records. External service took 45 seconds to respond with large dataset, exceeding 30-second client timeout.

### 5 Whys Analysis

1. Dashboard timeout → API call timeout
2. API timeout → Request took >30s
3. > 30s request → External service slow (45s)
4. Service slow → Too much data (1000 records)
5. Too much data → Missing pagination parameter

**Root cause**: Missing pagination parameter in API call

### Fix Implemented

- Added `page_size` parameter (default 10) to `fetchExternalData()`
- Modified API call to include pagination params
- Response time reduced from 45s → 2s

### Files Changed

- `src/services/StudentProgressService.ts` (lines 45-52)
- `tests/StudentProgressService.test.ts` (added regression test)

### Prevention

- Unit test: Verify pagination parameter included
- Integration test: Dashboard loads within 5s with large datasets
- Added performance monitoring alert if response time >10s

### Related Errors

- Similar to ERR-0015 (pagination missing in different service)
- Pattern: Always include pagination for external API calls
```

See references/error-log-template.md for full template.

**Validation**: error-log.md updated with complete entry, ERR-XXXX ID assigned.
</step>

<step number="8">
**Verify and close**

Final checks:

```bash
# Error no longer reproduces
# (run original reproduction steps)

# All tests pass
npm test  # or pytest, cargo test, etc.

# Logs confirm fix
# Check application logs for success

# No regressions introduced
# Run full test suite
```

Update state.yaml (if debugging during a phase):

```yaml
debug:
  status: completed
  error_id: ERR-0042
  root_cause: Missing pagination parameter
  tests_added: 2
```

**Validation**: Error resolved, documented, tests added, no regressions.
</step>
</workflow>

<validation>
After debugging, verify:

- Error reproduces consistently before fix (validated reproduction)
- Root cause identified using 5 Whys or systematic technique
- Fix addresses root cause, not symptoms
- Failing test written first (TDD approach)
- All tests pass after fix
- Regression tests added to prevent recurrence
- Error documented in error-log.md with ERR-XXXX ID
- No new errors introduced (full test suite passes)
  </validation>

<anti_patterns>
<pitfall name="symptom_fixing">
**❌ Don't**: Fix symptoms without finding root cause

- Adding try/catch to hide error
- Increasing timeout without investigating why slow
- Restarting service to "fix" memory leak

**✅ Do**: Use 5 Whys to drill down to root cause, fix underlying issue

**Why**: Symptom fixes lead to recurring errors, technical debt, unreliable system

**Example** (bad):

```python
# Symptom fix: Hide error with try/catch
try:
    data = api.fetch(student_id)
except TimeoutError:
    return []  # Return empty, ignore error
```

**Example** (good):

```python
# Root cause fix: Add pagination to prevent timeout
data = api.fetch(student_id, page_size=10)  # Paginate to reduce data
```

</pitfall>

<pitfall name="trial_and_error">
**❌ Don't**: Random changes hoping to fix issue
- Change multiple things at once
- No hypothesis about what's wrong
- No reproduction validation

**✅ Do**: Form hypothesis, change one thing, test, validate

**Why**: Can't identify what actually fixed it, might introduce new bugs

**Example** (bad workflow):

```
1. Change timeout from 30s to 60s
2. Also add retry logic
3. Also increase memory limit
4. Error gone... which change fixed it? Unknown.
```

**Example** (good workflow):

```
1. Hypothesis: Timeout too short
2. Change only timeout: 30s → 60s
3. Test: Still fails
4. Hypothesis: Data too large
5. Add pagination only
6. Test: Works! Pagination was the fix.
```

</pitfall>

<pitfall name="no_documentation">
**❌ Don't**: Fix error and move on without documentation
**✅ Do**: Document in error-log.md with root cause, fix, prevention

**Why**: Same error may recur, team can't learn from past issues

**Required in error-log.md**:

- ERR-XXXX ID
- Root cause (5 Whys analysis)
- Fix implemented
- Tests added
- Related errors (if pattern exists)
  </pitfall>

<pitfall name="no_regression_tests">
**❌ Don't**: Fix bug without adding tests
**✅ Do**: Write failing test first (TDD), add regression test

**Why**: Bug may be reintroduced later, no safety net

**Example**:

```python
# After fixing ERR-0042, add:
def test_no_timeout_with_large_datasets():
    """Regression test for ERR-0042: Pagination prevents timeout"""
    # This test will catch if pagination is removed later
```

</pitfall>

<pitfall name="insufficient_reproduction">
**❌ Don't**: Start debugging without reliable reproduction
**✅ Do**: Achieve 100% reliable reproduction before investigating

**Why**: Can't validate fix if you can't trigger error consistently

**Intermittent errors**: Identify conditions (timing, data state, race conditions) to make reproducible
</pitfall>
</anti_patterns>

<best_practices>
<practice name="5_whys_analysis">
Always use 5 Whys to find root cause:

- Ask "Why?" 5 times to drill down
- Stop when you reach actionable root cause
- Document analysis in error-log.md

Example:

```markdown
1. Why? Dashboard timeout
2. Why? API call slow
3. Why? Large dataset
4. Why? Missing pagination
5. Why? Developer didn't add parameter

Root cause: Missing pagination parameter
Fix: Add pagination to API call
```

Result: Root cause identified, not symptoms
</practice>

<practice name="tdd_approach">
Write failing test first, then implement fix:

1. Write test that reproduces error (should fail)
2. Implement fix
3. Run test (should pass)
4. Add regression test

Result: Fix validated, regression prevented
</practice>

<practice name="binary_search_debugging">
For complex codebases, use binary search:

1. Add logging at midpoint of suspected code
2. Determine if error before or after midpoint
3. Narrow to half of code
4. Repeat until isolated to specific function

Result: Quickly narrow down error location in large codebase
</practice>

<practice name="comprehensive_documentation">
Document every error in error-log.md:
- ERR-XXXX ID for reference
- Root cause (5 Whys analysis)
- Fix implemented (files changed, approach)
- Tests added (regression prevention)
- Related errors (patterns)

Result: Team learns from past errors, patterns identified
</practice>
</best_practices>

<success_criteria>
Debugging complete when:

- [ ] Error reproduces consistently (100% reproduction or conditions identified)
- [ ] Error classified by type (syntax/runtime/logic/integration/performance) and severity (critical/high/medium/low)
- [ ] Root cause identified using 5 Whys or systematic technique (not symptoms)
- [ ] Fix implemented addressing root cause
- [ ] Failing test written first (TDD approach)
- [ ] All tests pass after fix
- [ ] Regression tests added to prevent recurrence
- [ ] error-log.md updated with ERR-XXXX ID, root cause, fix, tests
- [ ] Full test suite passes (no regressions introduced)
- [ ] Error no longer reproduces with original steps
      </success_criteria>

<quality_standards>
**Good debugging**:

- Root cause identified (5 Whys completed)
- Failing test written before fix (TDD)
- Regression tests added (≥1 per error)
- Comprehensive error-log.md entry (includes root cause, fix, tests)
- No symptom fixes (addresses underlying issue)

**Bad debugging**:

- Symptom fixes (try/catch to hide error, increase timeout without investigation)
- Trial and error (change multiple things, no hypothesis)
- No tests added (no regression prevention)
- No documentation (error-log.md not updated)
- Insufficient reproduction (can't trigger error reliably)
  </quality_standards>

<troubleshooting>
**Issue**: Can't reproduce error consistently
**Solution**: Identify conditions (timing, data state, environment), use logging to capture state when error occurs

**Issue**: 5 Whys leads to "developer mistake"
**Solution**: Keep asking why - why did developer make mistake? (unclear docs, missing validation, no tests?)

**Issue**: Fix works but not sure why
**Solution**: Add detailed logging before/after fix, compare behavior, validate hypothesis

**Issue**: Error recurs after fix
**Solution**: Check if root cause was correctly identified (use 5 Whys again), verify tests actually prevent recurrence

**Issue**: Too many errors to debug
**Solution**: Prioritize by severity (critical > high > medium > low), check for common root causes (same component, same pattern)
</troubleshooting>
