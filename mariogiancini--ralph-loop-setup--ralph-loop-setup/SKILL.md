# Ralph Loop Setup Skill

Set up and maintain autonomous TDD loops for iterative development with verification feedback.

## When This Activates

- User asks to "set up Ralph" or "add autonomous loop" to a project
- User wants to update Ralph hooks based on latest practices
- Troubleshooting loop behavior (not iterating, verification failing)
- Setting up a new project for autonomous development

## What is Ralph?

The [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) is an autonomous TDD workflow where Claude iteratively works on tasks until a verification command passes and a completion promise is detected.

**Key components:**
1. **Start Command** - Initializes loop with task and options
2. **Loop Mechanism** - Either stop hook (same-session) or external script (fresh-context)
3. **State File** - Tracks iteration count, completion promise
4. **Context Files** - `progress.md` for cross-session memory, `prd.json` for tasks, `guardrails.md` for learned constraints

## Two Architectural Modes

Ralph supports two fundamentally different loop architectures. **Fresh-context is the default for multi-task mode** because it follows the true Ralph pattern: deliberate rotation, not accidental compaction.

### Fresh-Context (Default for `--next`)

Uses an external bash script that spawns new Claude sessions each iteration.

```bash
/ralph-loop --next                          # Fresh-context by default
./scripts/ralph/ralph.sh --max-iterations 100
```

**Pros:** Each iteration starts clean, no context pollution, failures evaporate, true re-anchoring.
**Cons:** More complex setup, loses conversation context.
**Best for:** Multi-task backlogs, long runs (20+ iterations).

### Same-Session (Opt-In)

Uses Claude Code's stop hook to block exit and re-prompt within the same session.

```bash
/ralph-loop "Fix all TypeScript errors"    # Single task = same-session
/ralph-loop --next --same-session          # Multi-task with same-session (opt-in)
```

**Pros:** Simpler setup, works within Claude Code's native system, preserves conversation context.
**Cons:** Context accumulates, failed attempts stay in transcript.
**Best for:** Bounded single tasks, short runs (under 20 iterations).

This follows [Geoffrey Huntley's original vision](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/), [Gordon Mickel's flow-next](https://github.com/gmickel/gmickel-claude-marketplace), and [Agrim Singh's "ralph for idiots"](https://x.com/agrimsingh/status/2010412150918189210) insight that Anthropic's same-session pattern is "anti-ralph" because it accumulates context until it rots.

## Installation

To add Ralph loops to a project:

```bash
# From project root
/ralph-loop-setup
```

This creates:
- `.claude/commands/ralph-loop.md` - Start command (supports both modes)
- `.claude/commands/ralph-cancel.md` - Cancel/stop command (both modes)
- `.claude/commands/ralph-planner.md` - Plan tasks from GitHub issues
- `.claude/hooks/stop-hook.sh` - Same-session verification hook
- `.claude/settings.json` - Hook registration (or updates existing)
- `scripts/ralph/ralph.sh` - Fresh-context external loop
- `scripts/ralph/ralph-stop.sh` - Stop script (kills processes, cleans state)
- `scripts/ralph/ralph-status.sh` - Status dashboard script
- `scripts/ralph/ralph-tail.sh` - Log tail helper
- `plans/progress.md` - Cross-session context
- `plans/guardrails.md` - Learned constraints ("signs") that prevent repeated failures
- `plans/prd.json` - Task tracking

## Usage

Once installed:

```bash
# Single task, same-session (default for single tasks)
/ralph-loop "Fix all TypeScript errors" --max-iterations 20

# Multi-task, fresh-context (default for --next)
/ralph-loop --next
/ralph-loop --next --max-iterations 100

# Multi-task with verbose output
/ralph-loop --next --verbose

# Multi-task with auto-opened monitor window (macOS)
/ralph-loop --next --monitor

# Multi-task with verbose + monitor (recommended)
/ralph-loop --next --verbose --monitor

# Multi-task, same-session (opt-in)
/ralph-loop --next --same-session

# With visual screenshots for UI regression review
/ralph-loop --next --screenshots

# Work on a separate branch
/ralph-loop --next --branch ralph/backlog

# Preview without starting
/ralph-loop --next --dry-run

# Cancel/stop active loop (works for both modes)
/ralph-cancel
/ralph-cancel --force  # Kill without prompting

# Run external loop directly
./scripts/ralph/ralph.sh --max-iterations 100 --branch ralph/backlog --verbose --monitor
```

## Monitoring

Ralph provides several tools to monitor loop progress in real-time.

### Verbose Mode (`--verbose`)

Adds detailed output during iterations:
- Timing for Claude sessions and verification runs
- Last 10 lines of output after each iteration
- File path logging

```bash
./scripts/ralph/ralph.sh --verbose
/ralph-loop --next --verbose
```

### Auto-Monitor (`--monitor`)

Automatically opens a status dashboard in a new terminal window (macOS only).

```bash
./scripts/ralph/ralph.sh --monitor
/ralph-loop --next --monitor
```

**Terminal detection:** Prefers iTerm2 if installed/running, falls back to Terminal.app.

### Status Dashboard

View loop status, task progress, and recent output:

```bash
# One-time status
./scripts/ralph/ralph-status.sh

# Live updates (refreshes every 2s)
./scripts/ralph/ralph-status.sh --watch
```

**Shows:**
- Loop status with colored indicators (RUNNING, VERIFYING, COMPLETE)
- Progress bar and iteration count
- Current task being worked on
- Task checklist with completion status
- Recent runs history
- Last 8 lines of current output

### Log Tailing

Follow iteration output in real-time:

```bash
# Follow current/latest run
./scripts/ralph/ralph-tail.sh

# Follow all iteration files
./scripts/ralph/ralph-tail.sh --all

# Follow specific run
./scripts/ralph/ralph-tail.sh 20260113-120000
```

### Status JSON File

Machine-readable status at `.claude/ralph-status.local.json`:

```json
{
  "run_id": "20260113-120000",
  "iteration": 3,
  "max_iterations": 50,
  "status": "running",
  "current_task": {"id": "T-001", "title": "..."},
  "remaining_tasks": 2,
  "started_at": "2026-01-13T12:00:00-08:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-01-13T12:05:30-08:00",
  "branch": "main",
  "log_file": "scripts/ralph/runs/20260113-120000/iteration-3.txt"
}
```

## Branch Handling Options

Ralph supports two ways to manage branches:

### Option 1: CLI Flag (per-run)

Specify branch when starting the loop:

```bash
/ralph-loop --next --branch ralph/backlog-cleanup
/ralph-loop "Fix bugs" --branch feature/bugfix
```

**Best for:** Ad-hoc runs, different branches per task batch.

### Option 2: prd.json branchName (per-batch)

Set `branchName` in prd.json for all tasks in that batch:

```json
{
  "branchName": "feature/my-feature",
  "features": [...]
}
```

Then just run:
```bash
/ralph-loop --next
```

Ralph will automatically checkout/create the branch from prd.json.

**Best for:** Consistent branch for a set of related tasks.

### Priority

If both are specified, `--branch` flag takes precedence over prd.json `branchName`.

## Skipping Tasks

Some tasks cannot be automated (e.g., creating accounts, configuring API keys in dashboards). Use the `skip` field to exclude these from the loop while keeping them in prd.json for tracking.

### prd.json Schema

```json
{
  "id": "T-003",
  "title": "Configure API credentials",
  "github_issue": 83,
  "passes": false,
  "skip": true,
  "skipReason": "Requires manual account creation and API key setup",
  "notes": "Human needs to complete this manually"
}
```

### Behavior

- Tasks with `skip: true` are excluded from task selection
- Loop can complete successfully even with skipped tasks remaining
- Status dashboard shows skipped tasks with `⊘` indicator
- Skipped tasks still count toward total but not toward "remaining"

### When to Skip

- Account/credential setup requiring human login
- Dashboard configuration in external services
- Tasks requiring physical access or approval workflows
- Anything with "manual" in the acceptance criteria

## Ralph Planner

Use `/ralph-planner` to generate prd.json entries from GitHub issues:

```bash
/ralph-planner                    # Interactive selection from open issues
/ralph-planner --labels bug,P1    # Filter by labels
/ralph-planner --milestone v2.0   # Filter by milestone
/ralph-planner --limit 10         # Limit number of issues
```

### Features

- Fetches open issues from GitHub via `gh issue list`
- Analyzes issues for automatable scope
- Detects manual tasks and suggests `skip: true`
- Extracts acceptance criteria from issue body
- Sets priority from labels (P0→high, P1→high, P2→medium, etc.)
- Avoids duplicates (skips issues already in prd.json)

### Output

Adds new entries to `plans/prd.json` with proper structure. Run `/ralph-loop --next --dry-run` after planning to preview.

## Guardrails (Signs)

Guardrails are learned constraints that prevent repeated failures. They persist in `plans/guardrails.md` and are read at the start of each iteration.

**Philosophy:** Progress should persist. Failures should evaporate.

### Seed Guardrails

The template includes seed signs that prevent common pitfalls:

- **SIGN-001: Verify Before Complete** - Run verification before outputting completion promise
- **SIGN-002: Check All Tasks Before Complete** - Re-read prd.json to confirm ALL tasks pass
- **SIGN-003: Document Learnings** - Update progress.md with patterns discovered
- **SIGN-004: Small Focused Changes** - Keep changes incremental
- **SIGN-005: Use Skip for Manual Tasks** - Set `skip: true` for tasks requiring human intervention
- **SIGN-006: Reference GitHub Issues in Commits** - Include `Fixes #N` in commit messages

### Adding New Signs

When Ralph makes a repeated mistake, add a sign to prevent it:

```markdown
### SIGN-XXX: [Descriptive Name]
**Trigger:** [When this applies]
**Instruction:** [What to do instead]
**Reason:** [Why this matters]
**Added after:** [Iteration N / date when learned]
```

Signs are append-only. Mistakes evaporate, lessons accumulate.

## Visual Screenshots (UI Regression Review)

The `--screenshots` flag instructs Claude to capture visual screenshots via Playwright MCP. This helps catch UI/UX regressions that tests don't catch.

**Note:** In Playwright terminology, a "snapshot" is an accessibility/DOM tree capture, while a "screenshot" is a visual PNG/JPEG image. This feature uses `browser_take_screenshot` for visual captures.

### How It Works

1. **Fresh-context mode:** The `--screenshot` flag is passed to `ralph.sh`, which adds Playwright instructions to the prompt
2. **Same-session mode:** The state file includes `screenshots: true`, prompting Claude to use Playwright MCP
3. **Output:** Screenshots saved to `scripts/ralph/runs/{run-id}/screenshots/`

### Usage

```bash
# Capture screenshots during loop iterations
/ralph-loop --next --screenshots

# Fresh-context mode passes flag to ralph.sh
./scripts/ralph/ralph.sh --screenshot
```

### Playwright MCP Tools Used

When `--screenshots` is enabled, Claude uses:
- `browser_navigate` - Navigate to key pages
- `browser_take_screenshot` - Capture visual PNG screenshots

### Output Location

Screenshots are saved in the run directory:
```
scripts/ralph/runs/20260113-120000/
└── screenshots/
    ├── iteration-1-dashboard.png
    ├── iteration-1-settings.png
    └── iteration-3-final.png
```

**Important:** Screenshots are advisory, non-blocking. Tests passing is the gate; visual review is recommended but doesn't block completion.

## Project Requirements

Ralph loops work best with projects that have:

1. **Verification command** - A single command that validates code quality
   - Node/Next.js: `pnpm verify` (test + tsc + lint)
   - Python: `make check` or `pytest && mypy && ruff`
   - Go: `go test ./... && go vet ./...`

2. **Clear acceptance criteria** - Tasks with measurable completion

3. **Test coverage** - Automated tests for feedback

## Customization

### Verification Command

Edit `.claude/hooks/stop-hook.sh`:

```bash
# Change this line to your project's verification command
VERIFY_OUTPUT=$(pnpm verify 2>&1) || true
```

### Context Files Location

Default location is `plans/`. Edit the start command to change:

```markdown
# In .claude/commands/ralph-loop.md
1. **Read plans/progress.md** → Change to your path
2. **Check plans/prd.json** → Change to your path
```

## Templates

See the templates directory for:
- [ralph-loop-command.md](templates/ralph-loop-command.md) - Start command (both modes)
- [ralph-cancel-command.md](templates/ralph-cancel-command.md) - Cancel/stop command
- [ralph-planner.md](templates/ralph-planner.md) - Plan tasks from GitHub issues
- [ralph-fresh.sh](templates/ralph-fresh.sh) - External loop script
- [ralph-stop.sh](templates/ralph-stop.sh) - Stop script (kills processes)
- [ralph-status.sh](templates/ralph-status.sh) - Status dashboard script
- [ralph-tail.sh](templates/ralph-tail.sh) - Log tail helper
- [prd-template.json](templates/prd-template.json) - Task structure with skip field
- [progress-template.md](templates/progress-template.md) - Session notes

## Troubleshooting

### Loop not iterating
1. Check if `.claude/settings.json` has correct hook registration
2. Verify hook format is v2.1: `{"type": "command", "command": "..."}`
3. Check if state file `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` exists

### Verification not running
1. Ensure hook is executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/stop-hook.sh`
2. Check if verification command works standalone
3. Look for `jq` dependency (required for JSON output)

### Premature completion
1. Verify completion promise format: `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`
2. Check transcript for promise detection
3. Increase max iterations if needed

### Branch not switching
1. Check `--branch` flag syntax: `--branch branch-name` (no `=`)
2. Verify prd.json has `branchName` at top level (not inside tasks)
3. Ensure no uncommitted changes blocking checkout
