# Pipeline and project structure

Generic guidance for this project. For country- or broker-specific details, use the complementary skills (e.g. slovenian-tax-edavki,
ibkr-flex-query).

## Where to change what

| Goal                                     | Location                                                                          | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **New report type** (same tax authority) | Tax authority provider under `src/TaxAuthorityProvider/TaxAuthorities/<Country>/` | Extend report generation (XML/CSV) and report type enum; reuse existing grouping and lot matching.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **New broker**                           | `src/BrokerageExportProviders/Brokerages/<Broker>/`                               | Implement **CommonBrokerageExportProvider**: discover files, load to broker-specific type (CommonBrokerageEvents), merge, transform to sequence of **StagingFinancialGrouping**. See `resources/docs/brokerage-development/translations/README.en.md`. |
| **New tax authority (country)**          | `src/TaxAuthorityProvider/TaxAuthorities/<Country>/`                              | Implement abstract TaxAuthorityProvider (generateExportForTaxAuthority, generateSpreadsheetExport); add config/schemas and report generation as needed.                                                                                                |
| **Lot matching logic**                   | `src/Core/LotMatching/` and tax authority report generation                       | NONE / FIFO / PROVIDED are configured per report; implementation lives in Core and in how each tax authority uses the processor.                                                                                                                       |
| **Staging → core processing**            | `src/Core/StagingFinancialEvents/`                                                | Event and lot processors (stock, derivative, cash); grouping processor. Change here when the broker-agnostic staging format or core domain model changes.                                                                                              |
| **Company/country/treaty lookups**       | `src/InfoProviders/` and lookup JSONs                                             | Use the **infoproviders-lookup-data** skill for when and how to edit the JSONs.                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Key types (generic)

- **CommonBrokerageEvents** – Broker-specific container. Transformed into **StagingFinancialGrouping** (sequence, one per instrument).
- **StagingFinancialGrouping** – Broker-agnostic staging model. Input to **StagingFinancialGroupingProcessor**.
- **FinancialGrouping** – Core domain model (processed events, lot-matched lots). Input to **TaxAuthorityProvider**.
- **TaxAuthorityConfiguration** – Report window (fromDate, toDate) and lot matching method; no country-specific fields here.

## Pipeline flow

imports → broker (Extract + Transform) → StagingFinancialGrouping[] → StagingFinancialGroupingProcessor → FinancialGrouping[] →
TaxAuthorityProvider → exports

Broker and tax authority implementations are isolated in their own trees; the core pipeline (StagingFinancialEvents, FinancialEvents,
LotMatching) stays broker- and country-agnostic.
