# Email Compose Skill

Compose and send emails via KMail D-Bus integration.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user:
- Asks to compose, draft, or send an email
- Wants to email content to someone
- Says "email this to [recipient]"
- Needs to open KMail composer with pre-filled content

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information

Collect from user or context:
- **Recipient**: Email address (required)
- **Subject**: Email subject line (required)
- **Body**: The message content (required)

### Step 2: Format the Body

Apply 72-character word wrap for plain text email:
- Split into paragraphs (double newline separated)
- Wrap each paragraph at 72 characters on word boundaries
- Use plain text only (no markdown, no HTML)
- Escape double quotes in the text

### Step 3: Open KMail Composer

Use the simple 6-parameter D-Bus method to avoid attachment errors:

```
Tool: appmesh_dbus_call
Service: org.kde.kmail2
Path: /KMail
Method: org.kde.kmail.kmail.openComposer
Args: [to, cc, bcc, subject, body, hidden]
```

Parameters:
- `to`: Recipient email address
- `cc`: Empty string ""
- `bcc`: Empty string ""
- `subject`: Email subject
- `body`: Word-wrapped body text with \n for newlines
- `hidden`: "false" to show composer for review

### Step 4: Confirm

Inform the user that the KMail composer is open and ready for review and send.

## Important Notes

- KMail must be running for D-Bus to work
- Uses the default identity configured in KMail
- The simple 6-parameter method avoids attachment-related errors
- Setting hidden to "false" shows the composer for user review before sending

## Example D-Bus Call

```json
{
  "service": "org.kde.kmail2",
  "path": "/KMail",
  "method": "org.kde.kmail.kmail.openComposer",
  "args": ["recipient@example.com", "", "", "Subject Line", "Body text\nwrapped at\n72 chars.", "false"]
}
```

## Word Wrap Implementation

To wrap text at 72 characters:

1. Split text into paragraphs (on double newlines)
2. For each paragraph:
   - Split into words
   - Build lines by adding words until line exceeds 72 chars
   - Start new line when limit reached
3. Join lines with single newlines within paragraphs
4. Join paragraphs with double newlines
