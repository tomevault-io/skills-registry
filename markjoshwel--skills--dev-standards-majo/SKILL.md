# Mark's Development Standards

Core development standards that apply across all languages and projects.

## Goal

Ensure all generated code is maintainable, readable, and consistent with established
patterns. Enforce British English, proper error handling, and AGENTS.md maintenance
across every project and language.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when:**
- Starting work on any codebase
- Generating new code in any language
- Refactoring existing code
- Unsure about documentation requirements
- Need to maintain AGENTS.md
- Writing error messages or handling failures
- Unsure about spelling (British vs American English)

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- You need language-specific guidance (use `python-majo`, `js-bun-majo`, etc.)
- You're only reading code without making changes
- The task is purely exploratory with no code generation

## Process

### Step 1: Check for AGENTS.md

Always check for AGENTS.md first:

```bash
# Check if AGENTS.md exists
ls AGENTS.md AGENTS.PLAN.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No AGENTS.md found"

# Read it if it exists
cat AGENTS.md
```

### Step 2: Apply Universal Principles

For every code generation task:

1. **Maintainability First** - Code should be readable and modular
2. **Self-Documenting** - Clear variable names, no excessive comments
3. **Diagnostic Cleanliness** - No errors or warnings (suppress only when reasonable)
4. **British English** - colour, behaviour, licence (noun), initialise, etc.

### Step 3: Follow Error Handling Standards

Use consistent error format:
```
program: level: message
```

**Print to stderr and use specific exit codes** (grouped by category):
- `0` - Success
- `1-29` - Usage errors
- `30-49` - Input errors  
- `50-69` - File/IO errors
- `70-89` - Processing errors
- `255` - Runtime error

### Step 4: Update AGENTS.md

After any significant work:
- Update knowledge of codebase
- Note code style and structure
- Record practices and methodologies
- Update current task status

## Constraints

- **Always use British English** - colour, behaviour, licence (noun), initialise, organised, centre (physical location)
- **Never exceed 800 tokens in AGENTS.md root** - Use progressive disclosure for larger docs
- **Always include SPDX identifiers** in new source files
- **Never commit without checking AGENTS.md first**
- **Always quote variables** in shell scripts to prevent word splitting
- **Never use vague guidance** - Be specific: "Never commit secrets" not "Be careful with secrets"

## British English (Strict Requirement)

**Always use British English spellings throughout all code and documentation.**

Common documentation words:
- **colour** (not color)
- **licence** (noun) / **license** (verb)
- **behaviour** (not behavior)
- **favourite** (not favorite)
- **organised** (not organized)
- **initialise** (not initialize)
- **center** (technical/abstract, e.g. image center) / **centre** (a physical location, e.g. town centre)
- **recognised** (not recognized)
- **genericised** (not genericized)

**Exception**: Standard file names like `LICENSE` and `LICENSE-0BSD` use American spelling for compatibility with tooling and conventions.

## Universal Code Principles

### Code Quality

**Maintainability First**
- Generated code should be maintainable through readability and/or modularity
- No undue pre-optimization beyond existing complexity in the codebase
- Follow conventions of previous or attached files

**Self-Documenting Code**
- Code should not require extensive comments
- Variable names and expressions should visibly describe the logic
- Naming should be apt yet visible in describing implemented logic

**Diagnostic Cleanliness**
- Generated code should not have diagnostic errors or warnings
- Suppress diagnostics only when reasonable (e.g., external package missing type stubs)

### Code Organization

**Section Comments**
Use clear section comments to group related code:
```python
# constants
VERSION: Final[str] = "1.0.0"
DEBUG: Final[bool] = False

# configuration
config = load_config()

# main logic
result = process(config)
```

**Defensive Programming**
- Check preconditions before operations
- Validate inputs early
- Provide descriptive error messages
- Use specific exit codes for different error types

**Logical Grouping**
- Group related constants together
- Keep functions/methods focused on single responsibility
- Separate I/O from business logic where possible

## Error Handling

### Message Format

Use a consistent format across all languages:

```
program: level: message
```

**Levels** (in order of severity):
- `error:` — Fatal errors requiring exit
- `internal error:` — Bugs or unexpected failures
- `warning:` or `warn:` — Non-fatal issues
- `info:` — Status updates
- `debug:` — Verbose debugging (only when debug mode enabled)

**Examples**:
```python
print(f"surplus: error: {exc}", file=stderr)
print(f"zigbpy: internal error: {exc.__class__.__name__}", file=stderr)
print(f"warn: '{target}' does not exist, skipping", file=stderr)
```

### Follow-up Notes

Provide additional context using `... note:` prefix:

```python
print(f"zigbpy: error: unmatched brackets at depth {depth}", file=stderr)
print(f"... note: depth {depth} - program index {start} -> {end} [unmatched]", file=stderr)
```

### Exit Codes

Group exit codes by category:

- `0`: Success
- `-1` (or `255`, depending on platform): Runtime error, unexpected crash
- Usage errors
- Input errors
- File/IO errors
- Memory errors
- Processing errors

and so on, using ranges for each category,
e.g. `1-29` for usage errors, `30-49` for input errors, and so on,
depending on how many errors and categories you have and/or expect to encounter.

**Example** (document at top of CLI scripts):

```python
# exit codes:
# 0  - success
# 1  - bad command usage or missing env vars
# 2  - bad target
# 3  - could not send message
# 10 - invalid input format
# 20 - file not found
# 255 - runtime error
```

### File Operations

**Respect File Moves**
- If a file has been renamed/moved without duplicate, consider the newest structure correct
- Do not revert seemingly deliberate file moves if you did not cause them

## Documentation Policy

**NO Documentation Unless Asked**
- Do not write README files, API docs, or user-facing documentation unless explicitly requested
- Do not write code comments explaining obvious logic

**License Headers**
All source files must include the full license text at the top. See language-specific skills for exact formatting:
- `python-majo` - Python file headers
- `shell-majo` - Shell script headers
- `rust-majo` - Rust file headers (if created)
- `zig-majo` - Zig file headers (if created)

**AGENTS.md Maintenance (CRITICAL)**

Maintain an `AGENTS.md` file with:
- Knowledge of the codebase
- Understood code style and structure
- Practices and methodologies recognized
- Linguistic style of comments
- Current task at hand and/or to-do list

**Location**: Place wherever documentation is stored in the project.

**Purpose**: Enable resumption from a context-less state without requiring codebase inquiry every time a new agent-or-LLM conversation thread starts.

**Updates**: Update old knowledge in the file as you work.

## Environment Awareness

### Read-Write Environment

**Gemini CLI, Claude Code, ChatGPT Codex CLI**: Your environment is NOT read-only. You can read and write files in this workspace.

### Search Constraints

**Grok-code-fast-1**: Do NOT use regex-based or purely wildcard workspace/file content searches. Use globs or regexes that have a non-wildcard component.

## SPDX License Identifiers

When creating new source files in public domain projects, add the appropriate SPDX identifier at the top:

**For most files** (dual-licensed):
```python
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense OR 0BSD
```

**For files by contributors who cannot waive copyright**:
```python
# SPDX-License-Identifier: 0BSD
```

## Testing Skills

Before relying on this skill, test implicit invocation:

**Should trigger:**
- "Help me write a Python script"
- "Refactor this code"
- "Create a new function"

**Should NOT trigger:**
- "Read this file for me" (no code generation)
- "Explain what this code does" (exploratory only)

## Integration

This skill works alongside language-specific skills:
- `python-majo` - Python-specific standards (UV, basedpyright, MDF)
- `js-bun-majo` - JavaScript/TypeScript/Bun standards
- `shell-majo` - POSIX shell scripting standards
- `git-majo` - Git workflow and commit standards
- `writing-docs-majo` - Documentation writing standards
- `task-planning-majo` - Planning workflows
- `setting-up-public-domain-repos-majo` - Public domain repository setup
- `running-windows-commands-majo` - Windows-specific command alternatives
- `skill-authoring-majo` - Creating new Agent Skills
- `agents-md-authoring-majo` - Writing effective AGENTS.md files
- `csharp-unity-majo` - C#/Unity development standards
- `mdf-majo` - meadow Docstring Format (MDF) for Python
- `mdf-md-api-docs-majo` — Writing API refs or docs from code using the MDF

**Always load this skill first**, then the appropriate language-specific skill.
