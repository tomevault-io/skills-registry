# Task Planning Workflow (Mark)

Planning protocol for complex tasks requiring structured execution.

## Goal

Enable effective execution of complex tasks by creating clear, actionable plans 
that align with user expectations and project standards. Reduce ambiguity, 
prevent rework, and ensure comprehensive coverage of all requirements before 
implementation begins.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use when**:
- The task seems complex enough to require multiple steps
- You're unsure about the approach or requirements
- The task involves significant changes across multiple files
- User explicitly asks for a plan
- The user says things like "break this down", "how should I approach this?", or "this is complicated"
- You need to make architectural decisions that affect multiple components
- The task spans more than 3-4 files or requires significant refactoring

## Do NOT use

- For straightforward tasks (single file, obvious fix, < 30 minutes of work)
- When user gives explicit step-by-step instructions
- For continuations of already-planned work (follow existing plan instead)
- For trivial edits like fixing typos or updating a single configuration value
- When the task scope is explicitly limited and clear

## Constraints

**Hard guardrails you must follow**:
- **Maximum 3 rounds** of follow-up questions - never exceed this limit
- **Always use AGENTS.md** for plan tracking when it exists; create AGENTS.PLAN.md only if AGENTS.md is absent
- **Don't over-research** - gather just enough context to reason about the task (5-10 minutes max), then plan
- **Plans must be actionable** - every task item must be specific and verifiable
- **Update plans in real-time** - mark items complete as you finish them, don't batch updates
- **Questions must be specific** - never ask "what should I do?" - instead ask "should I use approach A or B?"
- **Respect project standards** - always check AGENTS.md for project-specific planning preferences first

## Planning Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

Gather just enough context to reason about the prompt:

1. Read relevant files (AGENTS.md, existing code, configs)
2. Understand the codebase structure
3. Identify related components

**Don't over-research** - get enough to reason about the task, then plan.

### Step 2: Draft Plan

Think about and draft a plan in markdown regarding next steps:

```markdown
## Plan: [Brief Task Description]

### Phase 1: [First Major Step]
- [ ] Sub-task 1
- [ ] Sub-task 2

### Phase 2: [Second Major Step]
- [ ] Sub-task 1
- [ ] Sub-task 2

### Follow-up Questions
1. [Question about requirements]
2. [Question about approach]
3. [Question about constraints]
```

### Step 3: Ask Follow-up Questions (Max 3 Times)

Include any follow-up considerations you may want to ask the user before continuing.

**Rules**:
- Ask maximally up to three times for follow-up questions
- When asking, present them as up to five numbered questions
- Be specific and concise

**Example Questions**:
```
Before proceeding, I have a few clarifications:

1. Should the new feature be opt-in or enabled by default?
2. Are there any specific performance requirements I should consider?
3. Should this integrate with the existing auth system or be standalone?
```

### Step 4: Finalize and Execute

Once questions are answered:

1. Update the plan with clarified requirements
2. Proceed with execution
3. Track progress in AGENTS.md or AGENTS.PLAN.md

## Plan Tracking

### Where to Store Plans

**Primary**: `AGENTS.md` (if it exists in the project)

**Fallback**: `AGENTS.PLAN.md` (create if AGENTS.md doesn't exist)

### Plan Format

```markdown
## Current Plan: [Task Name]

**Status**: In Progress / Completed / Blocked
**Started**: [Date]

### Phases

#### Phase 1: Setup
- [x] Task 1 (completed)
- [ ] Task 2 (in progress)
- [ ] Task 3 (pending)

#### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Task 4
- [ ] Task 5

### Blockers
- [Description of any blockers]

### Notes
- [Any relevant notes or decisions made]
```

### Updating Plans

As you work:

1. **Check off completed items**: Mark tasks as `[x]` when done
2. **Add new discoveries**: If new tasks emerge, add them
3. **Update status**: Change status if blocked or completed
4. **Record decisions**: Note any important decisions made

## Testing Skills

Before executing a plan, always verify testing approach:

1. **Check AGENTS.md** for project-specific testing commands and requirements
2. **Identify test framework** used in the project (pytest, vitest, jest, etc.)
3. **Plan tests for new code** - include test tasks in your plan
4. **Verify after completion** - run the appropriate test command before marking complete

**Example test planning**:
```markdown
### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for new authentication middleware
- [ ] Add integration tests for login/register endpoints
- [ ] Run `pytest tests/auth/` and ensure all pass
- [ ] Check code coverage meets project minimum (if specified)
```

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Adding a New Feature

**User**: "Add user authentication to the API"

**Agent Response**:
```
I'll analyze this task and draft a plan. Let me first gather some context...

[Reads AGENTS.md, examines existing API structure]

## Plan: Add User Authentication to API

### Phase 1: Research & Design
- [ ] Review existing user model
- [ ] Choose auth strategy (JWT vs sessions)
- [ ] Design auth endpoints

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Add password hashing
- [ ] Create login endpoint
- [ ] Create register endpoint
- [ ] Add auth middleware

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Protect existing routes
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Update documentation

### Follow-up Questions

1. Should I use JWT tokens or session-based auth?
2. Are there existing user models I should extend, or create new ones?
3. Should registration be open or invite-only?
```

**User**: "Use JWT, extend existing User model, open registration"

**Agent**:
```
Perfect! I'll proceed with JWT-based auth extending the existing User model with open registration.

[Creates/updates AGENTS.md with the plan and starts execution]
```

## Decision Tree

```
User request received
    ↓
Is it complex? (multiple files, unclear approach, significant changes)
    ↓
Yes → Gather context → Draft plan → Ask questions (max 3 rounds) → Execute
    ↓
No → Execute directly
```

## Best Practices

### Do
- ✅ Keep plans concise but complete
- ✅ Ask specific, actionable questions
- ✅ Update AGENTS.md as you progress
- ✅ Mark completed items promptly
- ✅ Record decisions and their rationale
- ✅ Include testing phases in your plans
- ✅ Reference specific files/lines when asking questions

### Don't
- ❌ Over-plan simple tasks
- ❌ Ask more than 3 rounds of questions
- ❌ Let plans go stale (update as you work)
- ❌ Skip tracking in AGENTS.md
- ❌ Ask vague questions like "What should I do?"
- ❌ Forget to verify tests pass before completing

## Integration

This skill extends `dev-standards-majo`. Always ensure `dev-standards-majo` is loaded for:
- AGENTS.md maintenance policies
- Universal code principles

Works alongside:
- `python-majo` — For Python-specific planning considerations
- `js-bun-majo` — For JavaScript/Bun-specific planning considerations
- `shell-majo` — For shell script planning considerations
- `git-majo` — For planning git workflows and commits
- `writing-docs-majo` — For planning documentation structure
